There are no apples directly above the snake's head, and the snake will not collide with itself or the walls. The best move to continue the game and potentially position the snake to eat an apple would be to continue moving UP. However, since the goal is to eat as many apples as possible, and there is an apple to the LEFT, moving LEFT would position the snake to eat an apple on the next move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#A     #\n#H     #\n#      #\n#A A   #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nGiven the current direction is LEFT, the snake will move to the left. The next position of the snake's head will be where it currently is, but one space to the left. Since the current position of the snake's head is at (3, 2) and it moves to (3, 1), it will not encounter an apple or any part of its body.

The next move should not lead to a collision with the wall or itself, and ideally, it should aim to eat an apple. Moving UP will not lead to an immediate collision, but it won't eat an apple either. However, since the snake is currently moving UP, it can only change direction to LEFT or RIGHT to avoid moving in a straight line. Moving LEFT will not lead to an apple or a collision, but moving RIGHT will lead the snake to an apple, increasing the score and growing the snake.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to go RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#   H  #\n# A    #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nGiven the current direction is RIGHT, the snake is moving to the right.

To avoid the wall, we need to change the direction to either 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT'.

The snake will not grow, and the score will not increase. However, moving 'UP' is safe as it will not cause the snake to collide with itself or the walls. \n\nSince the snake is moving 'UP' and there is an apple directly to the 'LEFT', it would be beneficial to turn 'LEFT' to eat the apple. However, the snake cannot reverse its direction, so 'DOWN' is not an option. \n\nThe best move is to turn 'LEFT' to eat the apple and increase the score.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#H     #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nBased on the current game board and direction, the snake is moving to the left. The next move to the left will make the snake's head ('H') collide with the wall, ending the game. To avoid this, the snake should change its direction to 'UP' or 'DOWN'. Moving 'UP' will avoid immediate danger and also potentially lead to an apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#A     #\n#H    A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nGiven the current game board and the snake's direction, the best move to make is to move the snake to the left to eat the apple.

The next move in the 'UP' direction will not lead to any collision with the wall or with itself, but it will also not lead to the snake eating an apple. The best move to consider is to turn the snake towards the nearest apple while avoiding any immediate danger.\n\nThe snake can turn to the 'LEFT' to move towards the apple located at the left side of the head.

Therefore, the game will end in this move. However, if we are to provide a direction that would be the next best move assuming we can avoid the immediate collision, we would choose a direction that does not result in an immediate game over. Since moving LEFT results in a collision, we should select a direction that the snake can turn to next, which would be either UP or DOWN. \n\nGiven the current direction is LEFT, and the snake cannot reverse direction, the best move to make from the current position is to turn UP or DOWN.

If we move LEFT or RIGHT, the snake will not be able to eat the apple immediately, and moving DOWN would result in a collision with the wall.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n# AA  H#\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nGiven the current state of the board and the current direction (UP), the snake's head will move up from its current position. However, moving up will cause the snake to collide with the wall, ending the game. To avoid this, the snake should turn to the left or right. Moving left would cause the snake to move into the empty space, while moving right would cause the snake to move into the apples, which is a better choice as it will allow the snake to grow and increase the score.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to turn RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The snake is currently moving UP.\n2. The head of the snake is at position (4, 3).\n3. The apples are at positions (2, 1), (3, 2), and (7, 4).\n\nIf the snake continues moving UP, it will move to position (3, 3), which is an empty space. This move is safe and does not result in eating an apple. However, we should consider the long-term strategy to maximize the score.\n\nLet's evaluate the possible moves:\n- **UP**: Moves to (3, 3), which is safe but does not eat an apple.\n- **DOWN**: This would reverse the direction, which is not allowed.\n- **LEFT**: Moves to (4, 2), which is safe but does not eat an apple.\n- **RIGHT**: Moves to (4, 4), which is safe but does not eat an apple.\n\nSince none of the immediate moves result in eating an apple, we should choose the move that keeps the snake in a position to potentially eat an apple in the future. Moving UP keeps the snake in a central position, which might be beneficial for future moves.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to continue moving UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#A     #\n# AH   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nBased on the current game board and the direction the snake is moving (UP), the best move would be to continue moving UP to eat the apple ('A') directly above the snake's head. This will increase the score by 1 point and the snake will grow in length.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#A H   #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nGiven the current state of the game, the snake is moving upwards. The best move to make in this situation is to turn the snake to the right, so it can head towards the apple located to its right. Moving right will not cause the snake to collide with itself or the walls, and it will lead to the snake eating an apple and increasing its score.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#A  H  #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nGiven the current direction is RIGHT, the snake's head (H) will move to the right. The next position the snake's head will move to is currently empty, so the snake will move there without eating an apple or colliding with itself or the walls. The new position of the snake will be:\n\n########\n#      #\n#A    S#\n# A    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nSince the snake did not eat an apple, its length does not increase, and the score remains the same.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#A   H #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nBased on the current game board and the snake's direction, the best move to make is to continue moving RIGHT, as this will lead the snake to an apple, increasing the score and the snake's length.

However, since the snake is already moving 'UP', we need to consider if changing direction would be beneficial. Moving 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT' would not lead to an immediate apple, and moving 'DOWN' would lead to an immediate collision with the body. Therefore, the best move is to continue moving 'UP'.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#  AA  #\n#  H A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nGiven the current state of the game board and the direction the snake is moving (UP), the best move would be to continue moving UP to eat an apple and increase the score.

To avoid this, we need to change the direction to either LEFT or RIGHT. \n\nChoosing LEFT will move the snake's head to a position where it can potentially eat an apple and avoid collision with itself or the wall. Moving RIGHT would also avoid immediate collision but would not position the snake to eat an apple in the next move.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to go LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n# HSA  #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nGiven the current direction is LEFT, the snake's head will move to the left.

If it continues in this direction, it will not encounter an apple or itself, and it will not collide with the wall. However, we can see that there is an apple one step to the left. Turning left will allow the snake to eat the apple and grow. Therefore, the best move is to turn LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#    H #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#AA    #\n#A     #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nBased on the current game board and the direction the snake is moving (RIGHT), the snake is heading towards an apple ('A') located at the right edge of the board.

Therefore, to avoid collision, the snake should move in a different direction. The available safe directions are UP or DOWN. Moving DOWN would lead the snake towards an apple, which is a good move to increase the score.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#A A   #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n# H    #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN. If it continues in this direction, it will move into an empty space and not eat an apple.

However, moving LEFT would result in the snake's head colliding with the wall, which ends the game. To avoid this, we should choose a direction that keeps the snake alive and potentially allows it to eat an apple. The best move here is to turn the snake UP, which will move it towards the apple in the top row.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#A A   #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#H     #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the current game board and the direction the snake is moving (UP), the snake will move up into an empty space. Since there are no apples in the cell the snake's head will move into, the snake will not grow, and the score will not increase. The next state of the board will be:\n\n########\n#A A   #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#      #\n########\n\nSince the snake is moving UP and there are no obstacles or apples directly above the snake's head, the best move is to continue moving UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#A A  A#\n#      #\n#H     #\n#S     #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nGiven the current state of the game board and the direction the snake is moving (UP), the best move to make is to continue moving UP to eat an apple.

However, moving UP would not result in eating an apple, while moving LEFT or RIGHT might set the snake on a path to eat an apple in the future.\n\nThe best move to make now is to move LEFT, as it will position the snake closer to the apples without any immediate risk of collision.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n# H    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    AA#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nGiven the current direction is LEFT, the snake's head ('H') will move to the left.

Therefore, the snake will eat the apple, grow in length, and the score will increase by 1.\n\nThe updated game board will look like this:\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n# S    #\n# H    #\n#      #\n#    AA#\n########\n\nSince the snake is moving LEFT and there is an apple in the next cell, the correct direction to continue is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#H     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    AA#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nBased on the current game board and the snake's direction, the snake is moving to the left. If it continues moving left, it will collide with the wall, which will end the game. To avoid this, we need to change the direction to either 'UP' or 'DOWN'. Moving 'UP' will make the snake move into an empty space, and moving 'DOWN' will also move it into an empty space.

Moving UP, the snake will not encounter an apple or itself, and it will not collide with the wall.

However, to maximize the score, we should aim to move the snake towards an apple. The nearest apple is directly below the snake's head. Therefore, the best move is to change the direction to 'DOWN' to move the snake towards the apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake is currently moving UP and is one move away from a wall. To avoid hitting the wall, the snake should change its direction to either LEFT or RIGHT. Considering the positions of the apples, moving RIGHT would bring the snake closer to one of the apples, which is a better strategy.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nGiven the current state of the game board and the direction the snake is moving (RIGHT), the best move to make is to continue moving RIGHT to eat the apple. Moving in any other direction would not immediately benefit the snake or could potentially lead to a less optimal path.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#    H #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nGiven the current direction is RIGHT, the snake will move to the right. However, there are no apples in the immediate right of the snake's head, and moving right will not lead to a collision with the walls or the snake's body. Therefore, the snake should continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#     H#\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nBased on the current game board and the snake's direction, the snake is moving to the right. The snake is not in immediate danger of hitting a wall or itself, and there is no apple directly in its path. However, to maximize the chances of eating an apple, the best move would be to move 'DOWN' to get closer to the apples located in the lower part of the board.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#     H#\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nGiven the current direction of the snake is DOWN, and considering the next move, the snake will move into the empty space below it. The best move would be to continue moving DOWN to get closer to the apples. However, we should also plan for the next moves to ensure the snake can reach the apples without getting stuck.\n\nIf we continue moving DOWN, the snake will be in a position to eventually reach the apples. Moving LEFT or RIGHT now would not be optimal as it would take the snake further away from the apples and might lead to a dead end.\n\nTherefore, the optimal direction to move is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     H#\n#  A   #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN. If it continues to move DOWN, it will eat an apple, increasing the score by 1.

If the snake continues to move DOWN, it will eat an apple and grow in length, increasing the score by 1. There are no immediate dangers of colliding with the walls or itself, so continuing in the current direction is the best move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  AA S#\n#  A  H#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nGiven the current board and the snake's direction, the best move would be to continue moving DOWN to eat an apple and increase the score.

This will increase the score by 1 and the snake will grow in length. The new state of the board will be:\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#A H   #\n#  S   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nSince the snake will eat an apple by moving UP, the best move is to continue in the current direction.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#  A   #\n#  H   #\n#A  A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nGiven the current state of the game board and the direction of the snake, moving 'UP' will result in the snake eating an apple and growing.

However, moving UP would lead the snake to collide with the wall, which results in a game over. Therefore, to avoid this, the best move is to change direction to LEFT or RIGHT. Moving LEFT would lead the snake to an empty space, and moving RIGHT would also lead to an empty space, but it keeps the snake closer to the apples, providing a better chance to eat an apple in the next few moves.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#  SH  #\n#A     #\n#A  A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nGiven the current direction is RIGHT, and the snake's head is at the rightmost edge of the first row, moving RIGHT will cause the snake to collide with the wall. Therefore, the best move would be to change direction to DOWN to avoid immediate collision and potentially eat an apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#   S  #\n#A  H  #\n#A  A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nGiven the current direction is DOWN, the snake's head will move down from its current position. The next position for the head will be the square directly below the current head position. This square is currently empty, so the snake will move to this position, and the tail will follow, maintaining the snake's length.\n\nThe updated board after moving DOWN will be:\n\n########\n#   S  #\n#A     #\n#A  A  #\n#  SH  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nSince the snake did not eat an apple or collide with itself or the walls, the direction to continue moving is still DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#   S  #\n#A  S A#\n#A  H  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nGiven the current direction is DOWN, the snake will move down from its current position. The head 'H' is at (3, 3) and moving down will place it at (4, 3), which is an empty space. The body of the snake will follow, and the tail will move forward, maintaining the length.\n\nThe updated board will be:\n\n########\n#   S  #\n#A  S A#\n#A  S  #\n# H    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nSince the snake did not eat an apple and did not collide with itself or the walls, the next move direction should be chosen to potentially eat an apple and continue the game. Moving LEFT will place the snake's head on an apple, increasing the score and the snake's length.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#A  S A#\n#A HS  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake is currently moving to the left. If it continues in this direction, it will move into a square containing an apple ('A'). This is a good move as it will increase the snake's length and the score. Therefore, the best direction to move is to continue moving 'LEFT'.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#A    A#\n#AHSS  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nGiven the current direction is LEFT, if the snake continues to move LEFT, it will move into the wall, ending the game. The best action is to change direction to avoid the wall and possibly move towards an apple. Since the snake cannot reverse direction, the options are UP or DOWN. Moving DOWN would put the snake in a position to potentially hit the wall or its own body in the next move, so the best move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#AH   A#\n#ASS   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nGiven the current state of the game, if the snake continues to move in the 'UP' direction, it will collide with the wall. To avoid this, the best move is to turn 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT'. Turning 'LEFT' will allow the snake to move into an empty space, while turning 'RIGHT' will also move into an empty space and keep the snake safe from immediate collision.\n\nConsidering the current layout, turning 'LEFT' will move the snake into an area with more open space and a better chance to navigate towards the apples without immediate risk of collision.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#HS   A#\n#ASS   #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nBased on the current direction of the snake (LEFT) and the position of the snake and the apples, the best move is to continue moving LEFT to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The best move would be to continue moving UP to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#  H A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#    A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nGiven the current direction is UP, the snake's head will move upwards. However, moving UP will cause the snake to collide with the wall, which ends the game. Therefore, to avoid this, the snake should change direction to either LEFT or RIGHT. \n\nIf we choose LEFT, the snake will move to the left and the head will not collide with any walls or the body. The board will then look like this:\n\n########\n#      #\n# H    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#    A #\n########\n\nIf we choose RIGHT, the snake will move to the right and the head will not collide with any walls or the body.

This move does not result in the snake eating an apple or colliding with itself or the walls. Therefore, the snake should continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#   SH #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n#    A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nGiven the current direction is RIGHT, and the snake's head is at position (2, 5), moving RIGHT will place the snake's head at position (2, 6). This move will not result in the snake eating an apple, and the snake will not collide with itself or the walls. Therefore, the move is valid and the snake should continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#    SH#\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n#    A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake is currently moving to the RIGHT. Moving RIGHT will cause the snake to collide with the wall, ending the game. To avoid this, the snake should change its direction to either UP or DOWN. However, moving UP will not immediately lead to an apple, while moving DOWN will move the snake closer to the apples, potentially setting up a better path for eating them in subsequent moves. Therefore, the best move is to go DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#     S#\n#     H#\n#      #\n#  A A #\n#    A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nGiven the current direction is DOWN, and the next move will be to move the snake's head one step down. The snake will not encounter an apple or itself, and it will not collide with the wall.

This will result in a collision, and the game will end. However, since the task is to provide a direction, and to avoid the immediate collision, the best move would be to change the direction to either UP or DOWN. Since the snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot move RIGHT), and moving UP would also result in a collision with the wall, the best move is to move DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A  SS#\n#  A H #\n#    A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nGiven the current game board and the direction, the optimal move to eat an apple and increase the score is to move the snake to the left.

If it continues moving left, it will not collide with itself or the walls, and it will not eat an apple. However, since the snake can only move in the directions 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT' and cannot reverse its direction, the best move is to continue moving left to avoid immediate danger. \n\nHowever, since the snake will not eat an apple by moving left, we should consider changing the direction to one that will allow the snake to eat an apple while avoiding any immediate danger.

Turning LEFT will not result in a collision with the wall or the snake's body, and it will allow the snake to eat the apple and grow.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n# HS  A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nGiven the current direction is LEFT, and the snake's head (H) is about to move into the square with an apple (A), the snake will eat the apple, grow in length, and the score will increase by 1. The new state of the board will be:\n\n########\n#S S  A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#HS   A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nGiven the current game board and the snake's direction, moving LEFT would cause the snake to collide with itself. Therefore, the best move is to move DOWN, which allows the snake to continue moving without immediate danger of collision and potentially approach the apples.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#S    A#\n#H     #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#A  A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nGiven the current state of the game, the snake is moving DOWN and is about to eat an apple. The best move is to continue moving DOWN to eat the apple and increase the score.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#SA    #\n#H  A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#     A#\n#      #\n#SA    #\n#S  A  #\n#H     #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nIf the snake continues moving in the 'DOWN' direction, it will collide with itself, resulting in a game over. Therefore, to avoid this, the best move is to turn 'RIGHT'. This will move the snake's head to the right, avoiding the collision and potentially allowing it to eat an apple in the future.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#     A#\n#      #\n# A    #\n#S  A  #\n#SH    #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nGiven the current game board and the snake's direction, moving RIGHT will result in the snake's head ('H') moving to the right, which will lead to a collision with the snake's body ('S'). Therefore, the snake cannot move RIGHT. The best move would be to turn UP, to avoid the collision and continue the game.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#     A#\n#      #\n# A    #\n# H A  #\n#SS    #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nGiven the current game board and the snake's direction, the snake's head is moving upwards. The next move in the current direction (UP) would lead the snake to an apple ('A'). This move is safe and will increase the score by 1. The snake will grow in length as a result of eating the apple.\n\nThe next state of the board after moving UP will be:\n\n########\n#     A#\n#      #\n# AH   #\n#  A   #\n#SS    #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#     A#\n#      #\n# H   A#\n# S A  #\n#SS    #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nGiven the current direction is UP, the snake's head 'H' will move upwards. However, moving upwards would lead the snake to collide with the wall, which ends the game. To avoid this, we need to change the direction to either LEFT or RIGHT. Moving LEFT would make the snake's head go to an empty space, while moving RIGHT would lead the snake to an apple, increasing the score and the snake's length.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to go RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#     A#\n#      #\n# SH  A#\n# S A  #\n# S    #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nGiven the current state of the game, if the snake continues to move RIGHT, it will collide with the wall, ending the game. Therefore, the best move is to change the direction to DOWN to avoid the wall and potentially find a path to an apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#     A#\n#      #\n# SS  A#\n# SHA  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nBased on the current game board and the direction the snake is moving (DOWN), the snake will move down and eat an apple, increasing the score by 1.

Therefore, the best move is to turn LEFT or RIGHT to avoid the wall and continue the game. However, turning RIGHT would immediately lead the snake into a collision with its own body. Thus, the best move is to turn LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#     A#\n#      #\n#  S  A#\n#  SA  #\n# HS   #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nGiven the current direction is LEFT and the position of the snake, moving LEFT will cause the snake's head to move into a square occupied by the body of the snake, resulting in a collision and the end of the game.

The next move should be to continue moving UP to eat the apple (A) directly above the snake's head. This will increase the score and grow the snake. Moving in any other direction will not allow the snake to eat an apple and could potentially lead to a less optimal path or collision with the walls.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#  H   #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nGiven the current game board and direction, the snake is moving upwards. If it continues moving in this direction, it will move into the wall and the game will end. To avoid this, the snake should change its direction to either LEFT or RIGHT. Moving LEFT would lead the snake towards an apple, which is a better choice as it will increase the score. Therefore, the best move is to go LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#  A   #\n# H    #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nBased on the current game board and the direction the snake is moving (LEFT), the snake is moving towards an empty space. Moving LEFT will not cause the snake to eat an apple or collide with anything, so the movement is valid. The next state of the board will be:\n\n########\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#  H   #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nSince the movement is valid and does not result in the snake eating an apple, the answer is to continue moving LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#H     #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nBased on the current game board and the snake moving direction, if the snake continues to move LEFT, it will not encounter an apple. However, the snake can turn UP or DOWN to potentially reach an apple. Given the current positions of the apples, turning UP would allow the snake to move towards the apple on the same row.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#H A   #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nGiven the current state of the game, the snake is moving upwards. To maximize the chances of eating an apple, the best move would be to move RIGHT. This will allow the snake to eat the apple in the next move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n# HA   #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nGiven the current direction is RIGHT, the snake will move to the right. The next position of the snake's head will be where the first 'A' is located, so the snake will eat the apple and grow in length. The next state of the board will be:\n\n########\n#      #\n#  HA  #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake will continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#    A #\n# SH   #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake is currently moving to the right. The next move should be 'DOWN' to avoid the wall and to position the snake for a future move towards an apple. Moving 'RIGHT' again would lead to a collision with the wall. Moving 'UP' would not be a strategic move as it would not lead the snake closer to an apple. Therefore, the best move is 'DOWN'.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#    A #\n#  S   #\n#  H   #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nGiven the current direction is 'DOWN', the snake's head will move down to the square containing an apple ('A'). This will result in the snake eating the apple, growing in length, and increasing the score by 1. The new state of the board will be:\n\n########\n#    A #\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nSince moving 'DOWN' is the best move to eat an apple, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  S   #\n#A H   #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nBased on the current game board and the direction the snake is moving, the snake is moving DOWN. If it continues to move DOWN, it will eat an apple and grow. The next position will be:\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  S   #\n#A S   #\n#H     #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake will eat an apple, and the score will increase by 1. Since moving DOWN is a valid and beneficial move, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A S   #\n#  H   #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nBased on the current game board and the direction the snake is moving (DOWN), the best move to make is to continue moving DOWN to eat the apple located directly below the snake's head. This will increase the score and grow the snake.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#  S   #\n#  HA  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN. If it continues in this direction, it will move from its current position (6,3) to (7,3), where it will collide with the wall, ending the game. To avoid this, we need to change the direction to either LEFT or RIGHT. \n\nChoosing LEFT will move the snake's head to (6,2), which is a safe move and does not result in a collision with the wall or itself. \n\nChoosing RIGHT will move the snake's head to (6,4), which is also a safe move and does not result in a collision with the wall or itself.\n\nSince both LEFT and RIGHT are safe moves, we can choose either. However, to maximize the chances of finding an apple, we should choose the direction that keeps the snake closer to the apples. The apples are located at (1,4) and (4,1). Moving LEFT will not bring the snake closer to any of the apples, while moving RIGHT will bring the snake closer to the apple at (1,4).\n\nTherefore, the best move is to go RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#  S   #\n#  SH A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nGiven the current direction (RIGHT) and the position of the snake, moving RIGHT would cause the snake to collide with the wall. Therefore, the best move would be to change direction to avoid the wall. The possible safe directions are 'UP' or 'DOWN'. \n\nSince the snake is moving RIGHT and there is an apple ('A') directly above the snake's head, moving 'UP' would allow the snake to eat the apple. \n\nTherefore, the best move is 'UP'.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#   H  #\n#  SS A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A  H  #\n#   S  #\n#   S A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nGiven the current direction and the board state, the best move is to turn the snake to the LEFT. This will allow the snake to move towards the apple on the left side of the board without immediate risk of collision with the wall or itself.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A HS  #\n#   S  #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake is currently moving to the left. If it continues in this direction, it will move into the apple ('A') located at the top of the board. This move is safe as it will not cause the snake to collide with itself or the walls. Eating the apple will increase the score by 1 and the snake will grow in length.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#AHSS  #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nGiven the current direction is LEFT, the snake's head will move to the left. However, moving LEFT would result in the snake's head colliding with its body, which ends the game. Therefore, the best move is to change the direction to avoid the collision. The possible safe directions are 'UP' and 'DOWN'. \n\nChoosing 'UP' would move the snake towards an apple, which is beneficial for increasing the score.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n# H    #\n#ASS   #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#    A #\n# H    #\n# S    #\n#AS    #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nGiven the current direction is UP and the snake's head is at (2,2), moving UP will result in the snake's head moving to (1,2), where the snake will eat an apple and grow in length.

The snake will grow in length, and the score will increase by 1. The new board will look like this:\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#A  H  #\n#  S   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#A HA  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nGiven the current state of the game and the direction the snake is moving (UP), the best move to continue the game without immediate collision and to aim for the apple is to move RIGHT. This will move the snake's head to the right, avoiding the wall and the body of the snake, and also positioning it to eventually reach the apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#A SH  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nBased on the current game board and the direction that the snake is moving (RIGHT), the snake's head is about to collide with the apple ('A') at its next move. Since the snake is moving RIGHT, the next state of the board will be:\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#A SH  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    A #\n########\n\nThe snake will eat the apple, grow in length, and the score will increase by 1 point. Since the snake is currently moving RIGHT and there are no immediate threats (walls or the snake's body) in the direction it is moving, the best move is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#A  SH #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nGiven the current game board and the direction the snake is moving (RIGHT), the snake's head ('H') is about to collide with the wall if it continues in this direction. To avoid this, the snake should change its direction to 'UP'. This will allow the snake to move towards the center of the board, avoiding immediate collision and potentially moving towards the apples.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#    A #\n#    H #\n#A   S #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nGiven the current direction is UP, the snake's head is moving towards the apple ('A') located directly above it. To continue moving in the current direction and eat the apple, we should keep the direction as UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#    H #\n#    S #\n#A   S #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#    A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nGiven the current direction and the board layout, moving 'UP' would result in the snake's head colliding with the wall, ending the game. The best move would be to turn 'LEFT' to avoid the wall and potentially set up a path to the apples.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#   HS #\n#    S #\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#    A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nBased on the current game board and the direction the snake is moving, the snake's head is at position (1, 4) and it is moving to the left. Moving left would place the snake's head at position (1, 3), which is a valid move and does not result in a collision with the wall or the snake's body. The new position does not contain an apple, so the snake will not grow in length or increase in score.\n\nThe new state of the board after moving LEFT will be:\n\n########\n#  SHS #\n#    S #\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#    A #\n########\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#  HSS #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#    A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nGiven the current direction is LEFT, the snake will move to the left. However, the snake's head ('H') is already at the edge of the board, and moving LEFT will cause the snake to collide with the wall, ending the game. Therefore, the snake should not move LEFT.\n\nThe best move is to change direction to avoid the wall and continue the game. The available directions are 'UP', 'DOWN', or 'RIGHT'. Moving 'RIGHT' will cause the snake to collide with its own body, so it's not a viable option. Moving 'UP' or 'DOWN' will prevent the collision and allow the snake to continue.\n\nSince the snake is currently moving 'LEFT', it cannot reverse direction to 'RIGHT'. Therefore, the best move is to go 'UP' or 'DOWN'. Moving 'UP' will allow the snake to potentially move towards the apple in the upper part of the board, while moving 'DOWN' will move the snake towards the apple in the lower part of the board.\n\nGiven the current layout, moving 'DOWN' seems to be the best option as it will move the snake closer to the apple in the lower part of the board, which is more accessible without immediate risk of collision.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#  SS  #\n#  H   #\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#    A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nGiven the current direction is DOWN, the snake's head will move downwards. The next square in this direction contains an apple ('A'), so the snake will eat the apple, grow in length, and the score will increase by 1. The new state of the board will be:\n\n########\n#  SS  #\n#  S   #\n#A     #\n#  HA  #\n#      #\n#    A #\n########\n\nThe best direction to continue is to keep moving DOWN to potentially reach another apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n#A H   #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#    A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nBased on the current game board and the direction the snake is moving, the best move to make is to continue moving DOWN. This will allow the snake to eat the apple ('A') directly below its head, increasing the score and the snake's length. Moving in any other direction would not result in immediate apple consumption and could potentially lead to a less optimal position or a collision with the walls.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#  S   #\n#A S   #\n#  H  A#\n#      #\n#    A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nBased on the current board and the direction the snake is moving, if we continue moving DOWN, the snake will eat an apple, increase the score by 1, and grow in length. The new position will be:\n\n########\n#      #\n#  S   #\n#A S   #\n#  S  A#\n#  H   #\n#    A #\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#A S   #\n#  S  A#\n#  H   #\n#    A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nBased on the current game board and the direction the snake is moving, the best move would be to continue moving DOWN to eat the apple. This will increase the score and the snake's length.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#  S  A#\n#  S   #\n#  H A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nBased on the current game board, the snake is moving DOWN and is about to eat an apple. To avoid immediate collision with the wall, the best move would be to turn LEFT or RIGHT. However, turning LEFT would lead the snake into a position where it can potentially eat more apples and avoid immediate danger. Therefore, the best move is to turn LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#  S   #\n# HS A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nBased on the current game board and the rules, the snake is moving to the left. If it continues in this direction, it will collide with the wall, ending the game. To avoid this, the snake should change its direction to 'UP' to continue moving without immediate danger of collision and potentially move towards an apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#     A#\n# H    #\n# SS A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake is currently moving UP and is about to collide with the wall if it continues in this direction. To avoid this, the best move is to turn RIGHT, which will move the snake's head to the right and allow it to continue without immediate danger of collision.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#     A#\n# SH   #\n# S  A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nBased on the current game board and the direction the snake is moving (RIGHT), the snake's head will move into the square containing an apple ('A') in the next step, directly to the right from its current position. This will result in the snake eating the apple, growing in length, and the score increasing by 1 point. The snake's new position will be:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#     A#\n# H S  #\n# S  A #\n########\n\nThe current direction of the snake is RIGHT, and since moving RIGHT will result in eating an apple, there's no need to change direction. Therefore, the best move is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#     A#\n# SSH  #\n#    A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nGiven the current game board and direction, the snake's head is moving to the right. The next move should be to continue moving RIGHT to avoid immediate collision with the walls or the body of the snake. Moving RIGHT will not result in a collision and allows the snake to potentially move towards an apple in the future.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#  SSH #\n#    A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nGiven the current direction is RIGHT, the snake is moving to the right. The head of the snake is currently at the rightmost position of the row, and moving RIGHT will cause the snake to collide with the wall. Therefore, the correct action is to change direction to either UP or DOWN to avoid the wall and continue the game. Since there is an apple above the snake's head, moving UP is the optimal choice to maximize the score.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#    HA#\n#   SS #\n#    A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nBased on the current game board and the rules provided, the snake is moving upwards and is about to collide with the wall if it continues in this direction. To avoid this, the best move is to turn 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT'. Turning 'LEFT' would move the snake towards the apple on the left side of the board, which is a strategic move as it increases the score and potentially the length of the snake.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#   HSA#\n#    S #\n#    A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nGiven the current direction of the snake is LEFT, and the snake's head is at position (4, 4), the next move should be to the left. The position to the left of the snake's head is (4, 3), which is occupied by the body of the snake. Therefore, moving LEFT would cause the snake to collide with itself, ending the game. To avoid this, the best move is to change direction to either UP or DOWN. Since moving DOWN would also lead to a collision with the body of the snake, the only safe move is to go UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#A  H  #\n#   SSA#\n#      #\n#    A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nTo avoid the snake colliding with itself and to eat an apple, the best move would be to move to the left. This will allow the snake to eat the apple located on the left and continue growing.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#A HS  #\n#   S A#\n#      #\n#    A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT. The next move should be to keep moving LEFT to eat the apple ('A') and grow the snake. Moving in any other direction would not be beneficial as it does not lead to an immediate apple or may lead to a collision with the wall or the snake's body.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#AHSS  #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#    A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nGiven the current direction is LEFT and the snake's head is at position (3, 2), moving LEFT will place the snake's head at position (3, 1), which is an empty space. The snake will move, and the new board will look like this:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# SHSS #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#    A #\n########\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#HSSS  #\n#     A#\n#A     #\n#    A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake is currently moving to the left. If it continues in this direction, it will not collide with a wall or itself, and it will not eat an apple in the next move. However, it will position itself closer to an apple, which is a good strategic move to eventually eat it. There is no immediate need to change direction, as the current path does not lead to an immediate danger or an immediate apple. Therefore, the best move is to continue moving LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The goal of the game is to control the snake, eat as many apples as possible, and grow the snake in length. Each time the snake eats an apple, the score increases by one. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point.
