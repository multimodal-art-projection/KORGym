Since the snake's head is currently in an empty space and moving right would not immediately result in eating an apple, colliding with a wall, or its own body, the direction 'RIGHT' is safe to continue in for this turn. The snake has an opportunity to eat an apple if it continues to the right and then moves up or down to reach the apple located to the right of its current position.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n# A    #\n#      #\n#     H#\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the current board and the direction the snake is moving, the snake should continue moving to the right because there are no obstacles in that direction, and there's an apple to the right that the snake can eat. Moving right will increase the score by 1 as the snake will eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point. The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n# A    #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#H     #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","action":"DOWN"}

The snake is currently moving 'UP'. Given this setup, the snake is not in immediate danger of colliding with itself or the walls if it continues moving 'UP'. Furthermore, by moving 'UP', the snake will eat the apple located in the second row, first column, increasing its length and the score by one.\n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#  H  A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven the current game board and the fact that the snake is moving 'UP', the snake will not immediately eat an apple or collide with a wall or itself in the next move. However, the next move will place the snake's head in a position where it can potentially eat an apple if it changes direction to 'LEFT'. Therefore, the best immediate move to ensure the snake continues moving without collision and has an opportunity to eat an apple in the next step is to change the direction to 'LEFT'.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#A     #\n# H   A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the current game board and the rule that the snake is moving to the LEFT, the snake's head is currently at the position where the 'H' is located. Moving one step to the LEFT will make the snake's head collide with the wall as there is a '#' to the LEFT of the head. Therefore, the snake will lose the game.\n\nAnswer: LOSE","The current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#H    A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the provided game board and the current direction (LEFT), the snake will not be able to move in the LEFT direction as the snake's head is already at the leftmost position of the board. Therefore, the snake will continue moving in the current direction until it encounters an obstacle or a new direction is given. Since moving LEFT is not possible, the snake will continue in the LEFT direction until it hits the wall, which means the game will end.\n\nAnswer: GAME OVER"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Therefore, we should choose a direction that allows the snake to continue moving without hitting the wall or itself.\n\nGiven the options, moving RIGHT would allow the snake to move towards an apple without immediate collision.

The apple is located in the LEFT direction relative to the snake's head, so the best move is LEFT to eat the apple, increasing the score.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n# A    #\n# H    #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nBased on the current direction (LEFT) and the game board, moving left would cause the snake to collide with the wall. Since the snake cannot move in a direction that would result in a collision, the only valid actions are to continue moving in the current direction or to turn in a non-reverse direction. Given the current board state, turning RIGHT would be a valid move to avoid the wall and continue the game.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","The current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n# A    #\n#H     #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nGiven the current direction is 'LEFT', moving 'LEFT' would cause the snake to hit the wall and lose the game. Since the snake cannot reverse its direction, the only viable options are 'UP' or 'DOWN'. However, considering the positions of the apples, moving 'DOWN' towards the first apple would be a strategic choice to increase the score.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#H     #\n# A    #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","The current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#HA    #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nGiven the current direction is DOWN and the current state of the board, moving DOWN will lead the snake to a square without an apple or itself, so we will continue moving DOWN to move closer to the nearest apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","The current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#H  A  #\n########\n\nGiven the current direction is DOWN, the snake will move down and eat an apple, increasing the score by 1.

The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point.

The head will move to the cell directly above the snake, and the snake will grow by one cell. Since the snake is currently facing UP and will move UP, the head will move from its current position to the cell above it, which contains an apple.\n\nAfter moving UP, the board will look like this:\n```\n########\n#A  S  #\n#  H   #\n# A    #\n#  S  A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\nThe snake will have eaten an apple, and the score will increase by 1.\n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n# AH   #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the current game board and given the current direction of the snake as 'UP', the best move would be to continue moving UP since there is an apple right above the snake's head.

However, if we consider a move that prevents the collision and aims to eat an apple, 'RIGHT' would be a valid move since it avoids the wall and moves towards an apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#   H  #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\n---\n\nAnalyzing the current game board and the direction, the snake is moving to the right. If it continues in this direction, it will hit the wall in 3 moves and lose the game. Therefore, the optimal move to avoid collision and aim for the nearest apple would be to move down.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n# A H  #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the current state of the game board and the fact that the snake is currently moving DOWN, the best move would be to continue moving DOWN to eat the apple on the next move. There's no immediate need to change direction unless there's a collision risk or an opportunity to eat an apple in another direction that is imminent. Since the snake can't reverse direction, and there are no walls or snake segments blocking the DOWN path, moving DOWN is safe and beneficial for now.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#   H A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the given board and the current direction (DOWN), if the snake continues moving down, it will eat the apple at its next position, increasing the score by 1 and growing the snake.

Moving UP would result in the snake hitting the wall, which would end the game. Turning LEFT or RIGHT would allow the snake to move towards the apples. However, since the snake's head is directly above an apple to its RIGHT, turning RIGHT is the optimal move to eat the apple and increase the score.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#    H #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nBased on the current game board and the rule that the snake starts moving in the 'RIGHT' direction, the optimal move to eat an apple and increase the score would be to continue moving 'RIGHT'.

Since the square above the snake's head ('H') is empty, the snake will move up without eating an apple or hitting a wall. The next direction to maximize the snake's growth would be to steer towards the nearest apple, which is to the left of the snake's current position. Therefore, the optimal direction is 'LEFT'.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#A A   #\n# H  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven the current game board and the fact that the snake is moving to the LEFT, the snake's head will move to the left and eat the apple in the next move, increasing the score by 1 and growing the snake's length. Since the snake is currently facing LEFT, it can continue moving LEFT or turn UP or DOWN without reversing direction.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","The current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#A A   #\n#H   A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the board and the current direction (LEFT), the snake's head (H) will move left and it will hit the wall, resulting in the game ending. Thus, the correct action here would be to avoid moving left and instead choose a direction that will allow the snake to continue moving without hitting the wall or itself. Given the current setup, moving 'UP' would be a safe move.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#H A   #\n#S   A #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nTo proceed in the game, the snake should move in a direction that avoids collisions with itself or the walls and aims to eat apples. Since the current direction is 'UP', the snake is moving upwards. The snake's head is currently at the third row, and moving 'UP' would lead to an empty space, avoiding any immediate collision. However, to eat an apple, the snake should change its direction to 'RIGHT' to move towards the apple located right next to the head.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#SHA   #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nBased on the current game board and the fact that the snake is currently moving to the right, the best immediate move would be to continue moving right to eat the apple directly ahead. There's no immediate threat of collision with the walls or the snake's body. So, the direction should remain 'RIGHT'.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","The current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#SSH   #\n#    A #\n#    A #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nGiven that the snake is currently moving to the RIGHT, the optimal move to eat an apple and grow would be to continue moving RIGHT.

In the current state, moving 'UP' would cause the snake to hit the wall, ending the game. Moving 'LEFT' would cause the snake to eat an apple, increasing the score by 1. Moving 'DOWN' or 'RIGHT' would not result in immediate collision or eating an apple, but since the priority is to eat apples and avoid collisions, 'LEFT' is the best move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n# HS   #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nBased on the current game state and the current direction (LEFT), moving LEFT would cause the snake to collide with the wall, resulting in the game ending. Therefore, the best action to avoid collision and potentially move towards an apple is to change the direction to 'UP'. This way, the snake can move towards the apple located above it without reversing direction.\n\nAnswer: UP","The current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#AH    #\n# S    #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nSince the snake is currently moving UP and the head 'H' is right next to an apple 'A', moving UP will make the snake eat the apple, increasing the score by 1 and growing the snake by one segment. The snake cannot reverse its direction, so it can only turn LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nGiven the current configuration of the board and the fact that the snake is about to eat the apple directly above it, turning LEFT will allow the snake to continue moving without immediately bumping into a wall.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","The current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#HS    #\n# S    #\n#     A#\n#  A   #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nGiven the current direction is LEFT and the snake cannot reverse its direction directly, the options for the next direction are only UP or DOWN. Since the snake is currently moving towards the left wall, continuing to move LEFT would result in a collision with the wall, ending the game. To avoid this and to aim for an apple, the best move would be DOWN, which will allow the snake to move towards the apples located below it without risking immediate collision.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#SS    #\n#H     #\n#     A#\n#  A   #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#H    A#\n#  A   #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","The current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#S     #\n#S    A#\n#H A   #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nIf we move DOWN from the current position, the snake will eat an apple and grow.

The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#S    A#\n#S A   #\n#H  A  #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","action":"DOWN"}

If the snake continues in the 'UP' direction, it will not encounter an apple or collide with itself or the walls in the next move. However, the next move in the 'UP' direction will put the snake in a position where it cannot avoid a collision in subsequent moves without changing direction. Therefore, to avoid a collision and aim for an apple, changing the direction is necessary. Given the options, moving 'RIGHT' will steer the snake towards an apple without immediate risk of collision.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#   H  #\n#   A  #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nGiven the current direction and the board state, the snake will move to the right. The head of the snake is currently one space away from an apple, so moving right will make the snake eat the apple and grow in length.

The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point.

However, the snake will move to the RIGHT, and the new position of the snake head will be one square to the RIGHT.\n\nSince the snake's current direction is RIGHT, and it cannot reverse its direction directly, we need to decide if we should keep moving RIGHT, or turn UP or DOWN to potentially eat an apple. Given the board setup, moving RIGHT will not lead to an apple collision immediately, and turning UP or DOWN will not lead to an apple collision either in the next move. However, to maximize the chance of eating an apple, a strategic decision needs to be made.\n\nSince there's an apple directly UP from the snake's head, turning UP is the optimal choice to eat an apple and increase the score.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n# A    #\n#  A   #\n#    H #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n########\n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n\n########\n# A    #\n#  A H #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n########\n\nGiven the current game board and the current direction (UP), moving the snake head 'H' upwards would lead it to the apple 'A' situated directly above. This move will make the snake eat the apple and increase the score by 1. The snake will grow, and the board will update accordingly.\n\nAnswer: UP","The current game board is:\n\n########\n# A  H #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n########\n\nBased on the current direction (UP), if the snake continues to move, it will collide with the top wall, resulting in a game over. Therefore, a change in direction is necessary to avoid the wall and continue playing. Since the snake cannot reverse its direction directly, the best options are to turn either LEFT or RIGHT to avoid the wall and potentially move towards an apple.\n\nGiven the current setup, moving RIGHT would be the most strategic as it avoids the wall and also allows the snake to move towards an apple in the subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n# A   H#\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n########\n# A    #\n#  A  H#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n########\n\nGiven the current direction is DOWN, the snake's head will move down one step. Since the snake will not encounter any walls or itself and will not eat an apple in this move, it will simply move down. The new position of the snake's head will be in the row below, and the snake's body will follow, leaving the previous head position to be filled by the snake's body.\n\nThe next state of the board will be:\n########\n# A    #\n#  A  S#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A  H #\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","The current game board is:\n\n########\n# A    #\n#  A   #\n#     H#\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n########\n\nGiven the current direction is DOWN, moving the snake in that direction would not lead to eating an apple immediately. However, for the purpose of maximizing the score, we need to strategically plan the snake's movements to consume all apples without colliding with walls or itself. \n\nGiven the current setup, moving the snake DOWN is a good start as it aligns the snake with the path towards the nearest apple. After moving DOWN, the snake will be in a position to turn RIGHT to reach the apple.\n\nTherefore, the direction should be DOWN in this step.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n# A    #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#     H#\n#      #\n# A    #\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","The current game board is:\n\n########\n# A    #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     H#\n# A    #\n########\n\nGiven the current direction of 'DOWN', the snake's head ('H') is currently at the bottom of the board. There is an apple ('A') one step below the snake's head, but since the snake is at the bottom edge of the board, moving 'DOWN' would cause the snake to hit the wall and lose the game.\n\nTherefore, we need to change direction to avoid this. Since the snake cannot reverse its direction immediately and the immediate goal is to eat as many apples as possible, we should move 'RIGHT'. This will allow the snake to continue towards the apple located to the right of its head.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Since the next move in the UP direction will cause the snake to eat an apple, the snake will grow in length, and the score will increase by one. No direction change is necessary for this move as it leads to a positive outcome (eating an apple).

The snake is currently moving down, and the options are to continue down, turn left, or turn right (since reversing up is not allowed).\n\n- If we continue DOWN, the snake will move to the square below the head which is empty. This will not result in eating an apple or hitting a wall or itself.\n- If we turn LEFT, the snake will move to the left of the head which contains an apple. This will result in the snake eating the apple and growing longer.\n- If we turn RIGHT, the snake will move to the right of the head which is also empty.\n\nGiven the goal is to eat as many apples as possible, turning LEFT to eat an apple is the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","The current game board is:\n\n########  \n#    A #  \n# A    #  \n#  H   #  \n# A    #  \n#      #  \n#      #  \n########  \n\nBased on the current game board and the current direction (LEFT), the snake's head is at (3, 2) and moving left would cause it to collide with the wall, which would end the game.

Since the direction cannot be reversed and there's no immediate threat of collision with the snake's body or walls by continuing UP, the best action is to maintain the current direction of UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#A HA  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nAccording to the game board and rules, the snake's head is currently on a square with an apple ('A HA'). When the snake moves 'UP', it will eat the apple, increase its length, and its score will increase by 1. Since the snake is moving 'UP', the head will move to the empty square above it, and the body part that was previously below the head ('S') will move up to take the place of the head's original position, effectively growing the snake.\n\nAfter moving 'UP', the new game board will be:\n\n########\n#  AA  #\n#      #\n#S H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n########\n#  A   #\n#  H   #\n#A  A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven the current direction 'UP' and the current game board, moving 'UP' will cause the snake to hit the wall and lose the game. Hence, we need to find an alternative direction that allows the snake to continue the game without hitting the wall or itself. Since the snake is currently facing 'UP', it can only turn 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT'.\n\nTurning 'LEFT' will move the snake into the position where an apple is located, increasing the score by 1 and making the snake longer. Turning 'RIGHT' will move the snake to an empty space.\n\nChoosing 'LEFT' seems to be the optimal move as it provides an immediate reward (eating an apple) and keeps the snake alive. Therefore, the best direction to move is 'LEFT'.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n########\n#  A   #\n# H    #\n#A  A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the current game board and the rule that the snake cannot reverse its direction, and considering the snake's head is at the top of the board and is currently moving to the LEFT, the snake will hit the wall if it continues moving LEFT. Therefore, the best direction to change to, avoiding a collision and potentially moving towards an apple, would be to move DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#AH A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the current game board and the rules, the snake is facing downwards. The next best move should be to continue moving DOWN to eat the apple directly below its head. This will increase the score by 1 and the snake will grow.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n# H    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven the current direction is 'DOWN', and we aim to maximize the score by eating apples, the best immediate decision would be to continue moving 'DOWN' to reach the apple directly below the snake's head. This will allow the snake to grow and increase the score. There is no immediate danger of hitting the walls or itself.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n#      #\n# H    #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n# H    #\n########\n\nBased on the current direction and the game board, moving DOWN would lead the snake to an area where it could potentially eat an apple in the next move after adjusting direction. However, since the snake cannot reverse direction immediately, we should first align it towards the apple at (4,2). Given the current direction is DOWN, the best immediate action is to turn RIGHT so that on the next move, moving DOWN will allow the snake to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   H  #\n########\n\nBased on the current game board and the rule that the snake is initially moving to the RIGHT, the optimal move would be to continue moving RIGHT to eat the nearest apple. There is no immediate obstacle or situation that would require a change in direction to avoid collision or to reach an apple more efficiently.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    H #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving to the RIGHT. Given the current position of the snake's head and the apples, moving RIGHT will not lead to an immediate collision or eating an apple. However, the next step in the RIGHT direction will allow the snake to eat an apple and grow. Therefore, the next direction should remain RIGHT to eat the apple and increase the score.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     H#\n########\n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n#      #\n#     H#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nBased on the current board and the direction the snake is moving, I will choose the next direction to move the snake.

The goal of the game is to control the snake, eat as many apples as possible, and grow the snake in length. Each time the snake eats an apple, the score increases by one. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point. The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#  A  H#\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","action":"RIGHT"}

However, to maximize the chances of eating an apple, the snake should adjust its direction to face an apple. Since there's an apple directly above the snake's head, the best immediate move is to change direction to UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","The current game board is:\n\n########\n#A A   #\n#      #\n#A  H  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven the current direction is 'UP', the snake head 'H' is moving up towards the apple 'A'. Since the snake will eat the apple and grow in size, the snake's direction will not change as there is no immediate need to avoid a collision or pursue another apple in a different direction.\n\nThe next action will be to maintain the 'UP' direction to continue moving the snake towards the apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#A A   #\n#   H  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the current board and the direction the snake is moving (UP), the snake's head is at the second row, third column. If the snake moves up, it will collide with the wall at the top, ending the game. Therefore, the snake should change direction to avoid the wall and possibly move towards an apple.\n\nSince the snake is currently moving UP and cannot reverse direction, the options are LEFT or RIGHT. Given the current layout, moving RIGHT would not immediately lead to an apple and would start moving away from the apples, so LEFT is a better choice to stay within the vicinity of the available apples.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n########\n#A A   #\n#  H   #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven the current direction is 'LEFT', moving in this direction will cause the snake to hit the wall and the game will end. Therefore, we need to change the direction to avoid the wall and ideally move towards an apple. The best direction to move in this case would be 'DOWN' to start moving towards the apple located directly below the snake.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#A A   #\n#      #\n#A H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n########\n#A A   #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN. Since the snake is moving down and there are no obstacles or apples directly below the head (H), the snake will continue moving down without changing direction unless a change is necessary to avoid collision or to eat an apple.\n\nGiven the current state, there is an apple directly below the snake's head. Hence, the snake should continue moving DOWN to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#A A   #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the current game state, the snake is moving down. Since the snake is one cell away from an apple and there is no immediate risk of collision, the best move would be to continue moving down to eat the apple and grow the snake.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","The current game board is:\n\n########\n#A A   #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n########\n\nBased on the given board and the current direction (DOWN), the snake is moving down towards the wall, which would result in a collision and an end to the game. Since the objective is to avoid such a collision and eat apples, the best action here is to change the direction to the LEFT, where there is no immediate danger and the snake can continue to seek out apples.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","The current game board is:\n\n########\n#A A   #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n# H    #\n########\n\nGiven the current state of the board and the current direction (LEFT), moving LEFT would not make sense because the snake is at the edge of the board and moving LEFT would result in a collision with the wall. Instead, to avoid the wall and make progress towards an apple, the snake should move UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n\n########\n#A A   #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n# H    #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the current game board and the rule that the snake is currently moving in the 'UP' direction, the next optimal move to eat an apple would be to continue moving 'UP'. This will allow the snake to reach the apple in the square directly above its head without colliding with any walls or itself.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#A A   #\n#      #\n#A     #\n# H    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#A A   #\n#      #\n#AH    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven the current direction (UP) and the game board, moving UP would cause the snake to eat the apple above it, thus increasing the score by one and growing the snake's length by one. The snake cannot reverse its direction, so the only viable moves from the current direction (UP) are to continue UP, turn LEFT, or turn RIGHT. Since the space to the LEFT is a wall, turning LEFT would result in a collision and the end of the game. Therefore, the best move is to continue moving UP to eat the apple and grow the snake.\n\nAnswer: UP","The current game board is:\n\n########\n#A A   #\n# H    #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven the current direction is 'UP' and the snake will move one step in this direction, moving up would cause the snake to eat an apple located at the top of the board and grow in length. Therefore, the direction should remain 'UP' to continue the game and increase the score.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#AHA   #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the current game board and the current direction (UP), if the snake continues to move UP, it will hit the wall and the game will end. Therefore, to avoid this and to continue playing, we need to change the direction. Given the positions of the apples and the snake, turning RIGHT would allow the snake to move towards an apple without hitting the wall or itself.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n\n########\n#ASH   #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven the current board state and the initial direction (RIGHT), the snake should continue moving right to avoid immediate collisions and to aim for the apple. Since the snake is moving RIGHT and there is no immediate obstacle in that direction, no direction change is necessary.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#A SH  #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven the current direction is RIGHT, the snake should continue moving in this direction since there is no immediate need to change direction to avoid collision or to eat an apple.

Since the goal is to eat as many apples as possible, we need to consider the next best move to approach an apple.\n\nIn this case, moving 'DOWN' will lead the snake closer to the cluster of apples located below its current position. Moving 'DOWN' will not cause a collision with itself or the walls.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","The current game board is:\n\n########\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   AA #\n#    A #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven the current direction is 'UP', moving in that direction would cause the snake to hit the top wall and thus result in a game over. Therefore, we need to change the direction to avoid the wall and ideally move towards an apple. Since the snake is facing 'UP', the options are to go 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT' to avoid the wall. Given that there are apples to the right of the snake, the best next move is 'RIGHT'.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   AA #\n#    A #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#    H #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   AA #\n#    A #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#    H #\n#      #\n#   AA #\n#    A #\n#      #\n########\n\nIn the given game board, the snake head 'H' is moving DOWN and will eat the apple directly below it on the next move. Since the game rules state that the snake cannot reverse its direction, we will continue moving DOWN to maximize the score by collecting the apple. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","The current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    H #\n#   AA #\n#    A #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the current game board and the rule that the snake is moving DOWN, the best move would be to continue in the DOWN direction to eat an apple and increase the score. Changing direction at this point would not lead to eating an apple immediately and could potentially lead to a collision in future steps if not planned carefully.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here's the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    S #\n#   AH #\n#   AA #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the current direction (DOWN) and the game board, the snake will eat the apple and grow in length. The direction DOWN will keep the snake moving towards the apple on the next move. Therefore, the next direction provided should remain the same to continue moving towards the apples and avoid any collision.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    S #\n#   AS #\n#   AH #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN. In this configuration, moving DOWN will cause the snake to eat the apple ('A') directly below its head ('H'), thus increasing the score by 1 and growing the snake. However, after growing, the snake will be in a position where it cannot move further DOWN without hitting the wall, thus ending the game. Therefore, the best immediate move is to turn the snake LEFT to avoid the wall and continue the game.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    SA#\n#   AS #\n#   HS #\n#     A#\n########\n\nBased on the current game board and the fact that the snake is moving to the LEFT, the snake's head will move to the left, eating the apple and growing longer. The next action should continue to move the snake to the LEFT to avoid collision and potentially eat another apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","The current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#   AS #\n#  HSS #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nGiven the current direction is 'LEFT' and the game board state, moving left would not result in eating an apple or hitting a wall or itself. However, since the snake is moving left, if we continue moving left, the snake will eventually hit the wall, which will end the game. To avoid that, we should change the direction. Given the current configuration, moving 'UP' would be a safe move and also position the snake closer to an apple above it.\n\nAnswer: UP","The current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#  HA  #\n#  SSS #\n#     A#\n########\n\nIn the current state, the snake is moving UP, and it's positioned with its head ('H') at (4, 3) and has a body ('S') occupying (5, 2), (5, 3), and (5, 4). Given the current direction and the positions of the apples ('A'), the best move to eat the apple at (3, 5) without colliding with the walls or its body ('S') would be to keep moving UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#  H  A#\n#  SA  #\n#  SS  #\n#     A#\n########\n\nGiven the current state of the game, the snake is moving UP. If the snake continues moving UP, it will not collide with itself or the walls, and it will not eat the apple since it is not directly above the snake's head. However, the snake can turn LEFT to move towards the apple located to its left. This action would allow the snake to eat the apple and grow in length while increasing the score. Therefore, the best direction to move in this case is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# HS  A#\n#  SA  #\n#  S   #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe current direction is LEFT. Given that the snake is moving to the left, it will collide with itself as the head (H) is directly to the right of the body (S). Therefore, the snake must change direction to avoid collision and aim for an apple. Since the current direction is LEFT, turning RIGHT would be a safe move that could lead the snake towards the apple that is to the right of the head.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#HSS  A#\n#  SA  #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nBased on the current game board and the direction the snake is moving, the snake is currently moving to the left, which will cause it to collide with the wall on the next move. To avoid the collision and continue the game, the snake should turn upwards towards the nearest apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","The current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#H     #\n#SSS  A#\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nBased on the current game board and the rule that the snake is moving in the 'UP' direction, the snake's head is one step away from an apple. Moving 'UP' will make the snake eat the apple and increase the score by one point. Since the snake cannot reverse its direction and considering the presence of the wall in the 'LEFT' and 'RIGHT' directions, the best immediate move is to continue 'UP' to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n\n########\n#H     #\n#S     #\n#SS   A#\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nGiven the current state of the game and the direction the snake is moving ('UP'), moving 'UP' would cause the snake to collide with the wall, which would end the game. Therefore, the snake should turn to avoid the wall. Since the snake cannot reverse direction, it should turn either 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT'. Turning 'LEFT' would not result in eating an apple, but turning 'RIGHT' allows the snake to move towards an apple and grow.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#SH    #\n#S     #\n#S    A#\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nGiven the current direction is 'RIGHT', the snake will continue moving in that direction. Since the snake's head (H) is currently not adjacent to an apple (A), and moving right will not cause a collision with the walls or the snake's body, the snake will simply move one block to the right. Therefore, the new direction should remain 'RIGHT' to continue moving towards the apple located in the same row as the snake's head.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","The current game board is:\n\n########\n#SSH   #\n#S     #\n#     A#\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nGiven the current state and the fact that the snake is moving to the right, the snake is about to hit the wall, which would end the game. However, there is an apple to the snake's left and also two options down. Considering the snake cannot reverse its direction, the best move is to turn the snake downwards to avoid hitting the wall and continue the game, aiming to eat the apple below.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n########\n#SSS   #\n#  H   #\n#     A#\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN. Looking at the board, if the snake continues moving down, it will eventually collide with the wall or itself. Therefore, to avoid collision and possibly reach an apple, the snake should turn RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n\n########\n# SS   #\n#  SH  #\n#     A#\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nIn the current game state, the snake is moving to the RIGHT. If the snake continues in this direction, it will not reach an apple, and it will not collide with itself or the wall. However, to maximize the score, we need to direct the snake to the nearest apple, which is located to the RIGHT and DOWN from the snake's head.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be DOWN to move towards the apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n########\n#  S   #\n#  SS  #\n#   H A#\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nBased on the given game board and the current direction, the snake is moving DOWN. Following this direction will lead the snake to eat an apple and increase its score by one. The snake will grow in length, and the head will move to the square that was previously occupied by the apple. Here is the next state of the board after moving DOWN:\n\n########\n#  S   #\n#  SS  #\n#    S #\n#   HA #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#  S   #\n#  SS  #\n#   S A#\n#   H  #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#  SS  #\n#   S A#\n#   S  #\n# A H  #\n#     A#\n########\n\nGiven the current direction is DOWN, the snake head ('H') will move down one step. In this move, the snake will eat the apple located directly below its head, increasing the score by 1, and grow in length.
