The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point.

The head is at position (4,3). Moving UP will take it to (3,3), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score and grows the snake. There's no collision risk here as the new position is within the board and not occupied by the snake's body. Other directions (LEFT or RIGHT) don't lead to apples immediately.

Possible directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. Moving LEFT continues safely but leads away from apples. Moving UP takes the snake upward, which isn't near any apples. Moving DOWN to (2,4) is safe and positions the snake closer to apples in lower rows. After moving DOWN, the snake can turn RIGHT in subsequent moves to approach the apples at (4,5) and (3,6). Choosing DOWN avoids collision and opens a path toward the nearest apples.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# SS  A#\n# H    #\n#   A  #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is DOWN. To eat an apple as soon as possible, the snake should continue moving DOWN to position (5,3), setting up a path to reach the apple at (6,3) in the next move. This avoids unnecessary turns and aligns with the current direction, reducing collision risks. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# S   A#\n# S    #\n# H A  #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nThe current direction is DOWN. The snake's head is at position (5,2). To reach the nearest apple at (5,4), moving RIGHT twice would allow the snake to eat it. However, the immediate next move (RIGHT to (5,3)) doesn't eat an apple but positions the snake closer. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,2) and then RIGHT to (6,3) eats the apple there. Choosing RIGHT now starts the path towards the apple in the same row. Since the snake can't reverse direction, LEFT is invalid, and moving DOWN doesn't immediately collect an apple. The optimal move is RIGHT to approach the apple at (5,4).\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n# S    #\n# SHA  #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT.

Turning UP (row 5, column 3) leads to a collision with the body ('S'). Moving DOWN (row 7, column 3) is safe but misses the apple. Choosing RIGHT is optimal to eat the apple safely. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n# S    #\n# SSH  #\n#A A   #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT. The snake's head is at (6,6). To reach the apple at (7,4), the optimal move is DOWN. Moving DOWN to (7,6) starts the path towards the apples in row 7.

The head is at (6,4). Changing direction to LEFT moves the head to (6,3), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score and grows the snake. The new direction becomes LEFT, allowing the snake to continue safely. Choosing RIGHT would move the head to (6,5), which is safe but doesn't eat an apple. LEFT is optimal to maximize score and avoid immediate collision. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#    A #\n# SSS  #\n#A HS  #\n########\n\nThe current direction is LEFT. The snake's head (H) is at row 6, column 3. Moving LEFT would take the head to (6,2), an empty space. Moving UP to (5,3) leads to collision with body 'S'. Moving DOWN hits the wall. RIGHT is a reversal, which is invalid. Thus, the only valid move is LEFT. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#    A #\n#  SS  #\n#AHSS  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT. The snake's head (H) is at (6,2). Moving LEFT would take the head to (6,1) where there is an apple (A), increasing the score by 1. However, the next move would be into the wall at (6,0), ending the game. Moving UP changes direction to UP, moving to (5,2), which is safe and avoids immediate collision. This allows the snake to continue towards other apples (e.g., at (4,4) or (3,5)) in subsequent moves. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#    A #\n# H S  #\n#ASSS  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#    A #\n#HS    #\n#ASSS  #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is LEFT. The head (H) is at position (5,1). Moving LEFT would hit the wall (#) at (5,0), causing a collision. The viable options are UP or DOWN. Moving UP to (4,1) is safe but does not eat an apple. Moving DOWN to (6,1) eats the apple (A) there, increasing the score and growing the snake. The new head position (6,1) does not collide with the body or walls. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#    A #\n#SS    #\n#HSSS  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (6,1) moving DOWN. Moving DOWN would hit the wall. LEFT is a wall, RIGHT leads to body collision. However, in snake movement, the body follows the head, so moving RIGHT might not collide if the body shifts. But initial collision check considers current positions. Since all options lead to collision, the game ends.

The head is at (6,3) in row 6, column 3. Moving RIGHT will take it to (6,4), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score and grows the snake's length. Other valid directions (UP or DOWN) avoid the apple but moving DOWN would hit the wall. Choosing RIGHT is optimal to eat the apple safely. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#A    A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#SSSH  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at the end of the body (SSSH) in row 6, column 4. Moving RIGHT would continue toward the wall (column 7), risking collision. Turning DOWN leads to an immediate wall collision (row 7). Turning UP moves the head to (5,4), a safe position closer to the apple at (5,1). Choosing UP allows the snake to navigate toward the apple while avoiding walls and self-collision. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#A    A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A  H  #\n# SSS  #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is UP. The head is at (5,4), and the body is in row 6. Possible moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving LEFT directs the head towards the apple at (5,1) in subsequent moves. Choosing LEFT now allows the snake to safely navigate towards the nearest apple without immediate collision. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#A    A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A HS  #\n#  SS  #\n########\n\nThe current direction is LEFT. The snake's head is at (5,4) moving left. Moving left to (5,3) is safe as there's no collision. Turning DOWN would cause immediate collision with the body at (6,4). Turning UP is safe but doesn't lead to an apple. Continuing LEFT positions the snake to reach the apple at (5,1) in future moves. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#A    A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#AHSS  #\n#   S  #\n########\n\nThe current direction is LEFT. Moving LEFT allows the snake to eat the apple at (5,1), increasing the score. This is safe as the cell is not occupied by the snake's body or a wall. Other directions (UP or DOWN) avoid apples and don't contribute to the score. \n\nAnswer: LEFT",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The snake's head is at (3,3) moving right. Possible moves are RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. Moving DOWN to (4,3) leads to collision with body. Moving RIGHT to (3,4) is safe but no apple. Moving UP to (2,3) is safe and positions the snake closer to the apple at (2,5), enabling a path to eat it in subsequent moves. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#  HA  #\n# SS   #\n# S    #\n#     A#\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (1,3) moving UP. Moving UP again would hit the wall (row 0), causing a collision. The snake cannot reverse direction to DOWN. Valid options are LEFT or RIGHT. \n\nBy moving RIGHT, the head moves to (1,4) where there's an apple ('A'). This allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score by 1 and growing in length. This move is safe and avoids collision. Moving LEFT would take the head to an empty space but misses the opportunity to eat the nearby apple. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#  SH  #\n# SS   #\n# S    #\n#     A#\n#     A#\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake's head is at (1,4) moving right. To reach the apples in column 6 (rows 4-6), turning DOWN allows the snake to start descending towards those rows. Moving right keeps the snake in the upper rows, delaying access to the apples. Choosing DOWN avoids immediate collision and positions the snake closer to the apples. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#  SS  #\n# SSH  #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#     A#\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN. The snake's head (H) is at row 2, column 4. Moving DOWN would take it to row 3, column 4. However, the apples are located at column 6 in rows 4, 5, and 6. To reach the nearest apple at (4,6), the snake should turn RIGHT to move towards column 6. Turning RIGHT now allows the snake to head directly toward the apples. Moving LEFT would collide with the body at (2,3), and continuing DOWN delays approaching the apples. Thus, the optimal direction is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#  SS  #\n#  SSH #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#     A#\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (2,5) moving RIGHT.

The immediate next position in the current direction (DOWN) is row 4, column 5, which contains an apple ('A'). Moving DOWN allows the snake to eat this apple, increasing the score by 1 and growing in length. Other directions (LEFT or RIGHT) would move the head away from the apple, missing the opportunity to eat it. Although moving DOWN three times would eventually lead the snake into the wall, eating the three apples in the process maximizes the score before the game ends. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#   S  #\n#   SS #\n#    S #\n#    HA#\n#     A#\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is DOWN.

The head is at (3,4). To reach the apple at (2,5), the best move is to turn UP now. This positions the snake to move RIGHT next, directly into the apple. Since reversing direction isn't allowed, UP is a valid choice. Moving UP avoids walls and self-collision (no body yet). \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#     A#\n#   HA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (row 2, column 4) moving UP. The adjacent cell to the right (column 5) contains an apple (A). Turning RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple, growing its length and increasing the score. Since the current direction is UP, changing to RIGHT is allowed (not a reversal). Moving UP would go to an empty space, and LEFT moves away from the apple. Thus, the optimal move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#     A#\n#   SH #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A    A#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving RIGHT. The head is at (row 2, column 5), and the body is at (row 2, column 4). The possible directions are RIGHT, UP, or DOWN (cannot reverse to LEFT). \n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT, the head moves to (2,6), which is empty. No apple is eaten, and the snake's body follows. This doesn't immediately increase the score but keeps the snake near the top edge. \n\nIf the snake moves UP, the head goes to (1,5), which is empty. This path doesn't lead directly to an apple and limits access to the lower apples. \n\nIf the snake moves DOWN, the head moves to (3,5), which is empty. From there, the snake can continue DOWN toward the apple at (5,5) in three moves. This path provides a clear route to an apple while keeping the snake in open space, reducing collision risks and allowing further navigation toward other apples. \n\nChoosing DOWN avoids immediate collisions and strategically positions the snake to reach an apple efficiently. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#     A#\n#    S #\n#    H #\n#      #\n#A    A#\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#     A#\n#      #\n#    SH#\n#      #\n#A    A#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse to LEFT. Moving RIGHT would hit the wall (game over). The options are UP or DOWN. Moving DOWN allows the snake to reach the apple at (5,6) in two moves, while UP leads to (1,6). DOWN is safer for future moves towards other apples. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#     A#\n#      #\n#     S#\n#     H#\n#A    A#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nAnswer: DOWN\n\nThe snake is currently moving downward. The head is at (4,5). Moving DOWN to (5,5) is safe and positions the snake to turn RIGHT in the next step to reach the apple at (5,6). This path avoids immediate collision and allows the snake to grow by eating the apple next move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#    AA#\n#      #\n#     S#\n#     S#\n#A    H#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is DOWN. The head (H) is at (5,6). Moving DOWN would take the head to (6,6), which is safe but has no apple. Turning LEFT changes direction to LEFT, moving the head to (5,5). This avoids immediate collision and starts the snake towards the apple at (5,1). Moving RIGHT leads to a wall collision. Choosing LEFT is the optimal move to reach the nearest apple safely.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#    AA#\n#      #\n#      #\n#     S#\n#A   HS#\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#    AA#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A  HSS#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (5,4) moving left.

The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point.

The head is at (4,3), and there's an apple two steps to the right (column 5). To reach the apple efficiently, changing direction to RIGHT allows the snake to move towards the apple in two steps. Moving RIGHT now is safe and positions the snake closer to the apple. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   HA #\n#A     #\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is RIGHT, and it's positioned at (4,4) with an apple ('A') directly to its right. Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple, grow in length, and avoid immediate collision. Since the snake cannot reverse direction (LEFT is invalid), the valid options are RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. Choosing RIGHT leads to eating the apple and extending the snake safely. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SH #\n#A   A #\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving RIGHT. The head is at (4,5), and the body is at (4,4). To maximize the score, the best move is DOWN to eat the apple at (5,5). This direction is valid (not a reverse) and leads to an apple, increasing the snake's length. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SSA#\n#A   H #\n# A    #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN. The snake is moving down. The head is at (5,5). Possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. Moving right allows the snake to reach (5,6), then UP to (4,6) to eat the apple. Choosing RIGHT sets up for the next move to eat the apple. Moving DOWN leads to an empty space but doesn't eat an apple. Moving LEFT moves away from the apples. The optimal choice is RIGHT to position the snake to eat the apple in the next step. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    SA#\n#A   SH#\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (5,6) moving RIGHT. Moving right again would hit the wall. The available directions are UP or DOWN. Moving UP to (4,6) eats an apple, increasing the score and growing the snake. Moving DOWN to (6,6) is safe but doesn't eat an apple. The optimal choice is UP to eat the apple and avoid collision. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A  SH#\n#A   SS#\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4,6) moving UP. Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving LEFT leads to a body collision at (4,5). Moving RIGHT hits the wall at (4,7). Only moving UP to (3,6) is safe. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#     H#\n# A   S#\n#A   SS#\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (3,6) moving UP. Valid directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. However, moving RIGHT would hit the wall. Moving UP leads away from the apples, while moving LEFT starts progressing towards the apples on the left. Choosing LEFT avoids immediate collision and positions the snake to maneuver towards the apples in subsequent moves. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    HS#\n# A   S#\n#A    S#\n# A    #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake's head is at position (3,5) moving left. To reach the nearest apple at (4,2), moving DOWN allows the head to enter row 4, aligning closer to the apple. Moving LEFT continues away from apples, while UP moves away. Choosing DOWN positions the snake to turn left in subsequent moves towards the apple. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    SS#\n# A  HS#\n#A     #\n# A    #\n########\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    SS#\n# A HS #\n#A     #\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at (4,4) moving left. Possible directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. Moving LEFT takes the head to (4,3), which is safe. This positions the snake closer to the apple at (4,2), allowing it to eat the apple in the next move. UP or DOWN don't lead directly to apples and are less efficient. Choosing LEFT avoids reversal and sets up for an apple in the next step.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    S #\n# AHSS #\n#A     #\n# A    #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT. The snake's head (H) is at position (4,3) and moving left. Available directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. Moving LEFT to (4,2) eats an apple (A) safely, increasing the score and length. UP to (3,3) or DOWN to (5,3) are safe but don't eat apples. Optimal choice is LEFT to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# A  S #\n# HSSS #\n#A     #\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (4,2), moving LEFT. To eat the nearest apple at (3,2), changing direction to UP allows the head to move directly into the apple. This avoids collision and increases the snake's length. Other directions (LEFT\/DOWN) don't lead to immediate apple consumption. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# H  S #\n#ASSSS #\n#A     #\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is UP. The head is at (3,2). The closest apples are at (4,1), (5,1), and (6,2). Moving UP would take the head to (2,2), away from the apples. Moving RIGHT to (3,3) leads towards the body parts in row4. Moving LEFT to (3,1) positions the snake to potentially move down next to reach the apple at (4,1). Since moving LEFT is safe and strategically positions the snake to eat the nearest apple in the next move, the best choice is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The head is at (6,3). To reach the nearest apple at (7,5), moving RIGHT now allows the snake to start approaching the apple efficiently. Changing direction to RIGHT positions the head closer to the apple's column, enabling a path of two subsequent moves (down then right) to reach the apple. Continuing DOWN would also allow reaching the apple but requires two right moves afterward. Both paths are valid, but turning RIGHT immediately starts the snake on a more direct lateral path toward the apple, which may offer better future maneuverability. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n# A    #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n# SH   #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake's head is at (5,3), moving right. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (can't reverse to LEFT). The closest apples are at (3,3) and (6,4), both two moves away. Choosing UP allows the snake to move towards (3,3), which is centrally located and offers more future movement options.

The available directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving UP leads the head to (4,4), which contains an apple ('A'). This move is safe (no collision with walls or body) and increases the score. Choosing LEFT or RIGHT would move the head into empty spaces but not consume an apple, missing an opportunity to grow. Therefore, the optimal move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#      #\n# A    #\n#  H A #\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe current direction is UP. The snake can move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (since reversing to DOWN is not allowed). \n\nMoving UP to (2,3) is safe but doesn't lead to an apple. Moving LEFT to (3,2) is safe but also doesn't reach an apple. Moving RIGHT to (3,4) is safe and positions the snake to reach the apple at (3,5) in the next move. Choosing RIGHT allows the snake to efficiently eat the apple in two steps and provides a path to maneuver downward afterward. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n# A    #\n#  SHA #\n#  S   #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT.

Apples are at (2,4), (6,3), and (6,4). The closest apple is at (2,4). Moving RIGHT changes direction to RIGHT, allowing the next move UP to (2,4) to eat the apple. This path avoids collisions and efficiently reaches the nearest apple. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  AA  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (3,4) and is moving RIGHT. The closest apple is directly above at (2,4). Changing direction to UP allows the snake to eat the apple, grow in length, and avoid moving toward the wall. Since UP is a valid direction (not a reversal from RIGHT), this is the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#      #\n#   H  #\n#   S  #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#  AA  #\n########\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#  HS  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#  AA  #\n########\n\nThe current direction is LEFT. The snake can move LEFT, UP, or DOWN. Moving DOWN starts the journey toward the apples in rows 5 and 6. Moving LEFT or UP doesn't help reach the apples quickly. Choosing DOWN is optimal to approach the apples. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#  S   #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#  AA  #\n########\n\nThe current direction is DOWN. Possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Since none of the immediate next positions (down to (4,3), left to (3,2), right to (3,4)) have apples, the goal is to choose a direction that leads toward the nearest apples. The closest apples are at (5,1), (6,2), and (6,3). Moving DOWN allows the snake to reach row 6's apples faster. Moving LEFT would start a path toward (5,1) but requires more steps. Continuing DOWN is the most direct path toward the apples in row 6, particularly (6,3). \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#  S   #\n#  H   #\n#A     #\n#  AA  #\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  S   #\n#A H   #\n#  AA  #\n########\n\nThe current direction is DOWN. The snake's head is at (5,3), moving downward. Moving DOWN will take the head to (6,3), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score and grows the snake. The next move would require changing direction to avoid hitting the wall, but the current priority is to consume the apple. Changing direction to LEFT or RIGHT now would miss the immediate opportunity to eat the apple. Thus, the optimal move is DOWN. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#  S   #\n#A S   #\n#  HA  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#A    A#\n#  S   #\n#A S   #\n#  SH  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT. The snake can move UP, RIGHT, or DOWN. Moving DOWN would hit the wall (row 7), so it's invalid. Moving RIGHT to (6,5) is safe but leads closer to the east wall. Moving UP to (5,4) is safe and moves towards the center, providing better access to apples. Choosing UP avoids collision and positions the snake for future flexibility.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#A    A#\n#      #\n#A SH  #\n#  SS  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (5,4), moving UP. Possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. LEFT leads to collision with body. Moving UP to (4,4) is safe but no apple. Moving RIGHT to (5,5) is safe. The closest apple is at (3,5). Turning RIGHT aligns the head's column with the apple, allowing subsequent UP moves to reach it. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#A    A#\n#      #\n#A  SH #\n#  SS  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (5,5) moving right. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. Moving RIGHT leads towards the wall, which is risky. Moving DOWN takes the head to (6,5), which is safe but not towards any apples. Moving UP towards (4,5) starts a path towards the apple at (3,5). Choosing UP is the best option to reach the nearest apple and avoid collision. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#A    A#\n#    H #\n#A  SS #\n#   S  #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is UP. Possible moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving UP leads to (3,5), which is empty. Moving LEFT to (4,4) is also empty. Moving RIGHT to (4,6) is safe. The closest apples are at (3,6) and (5,1). Moving RIGHT allows the snake to reach (3,6) in the next step by turning UP, eating the apple. This path avoids future collisions and positions the snake for growth. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The snake's head is at position (4,3). The nearest apple is at (3,2). To reach it, the snake can move LEFT (changing direction to LEFT) to (4,2), then UP to (3,2) in the next step. This path avoids reversing direction and efficiently targets the closest apple. Moving LEFT now positions the snake closer to the apple's column, allowing it to eat the apple in the next move. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n# A    #\n# H    #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (4,3) and currently moving LEFT. To avoid reversal, possible moves are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. Apples are at (2,1), (3,2), and (6,4). Moving UP to (3,3) allows the snake to turn LEFT next to reach the apple at (3,2) in two steps. Moving LEFT to (4,2) also positions it for the same apple but requires an upward turn next.

The snake's head is at (3,2), and the closest apple is at (2,1). Moving LEFT to (3,1) positions the head closer to the apple. The next move can be UP to (2,1) to eat the apple. This path avoids immediate collisions and efficiently reaches the apple. Choosing LEFT is valid since it doesn't reverse the direction (UP to LEFT is allowed). \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n#HS    #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (3,1), moving left. Moving left again would hit the wall at (3,0), ending the game. Valid directions are UP or DOWN. Moving UP to (2,1) allows eating the apple there, increasing the score and growing the snake. No collision occurs. Moving DOWN avoids the apple but is safe. Choosing UP is optimal for scoring.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#      #\n#H     #\n#SS    #\n#   A  #\n#    A #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is UP. The head is at row 2, column 1. Moving LEFT leads to a wall (immediate collision). Moving UP is safe but moves away from the apples. Moving RIGHT allows the snake to start a path towards the apples in subsequent moves. Choosing RIGHT is the viable option to avoid collision and aim for the apples.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#SH    #\n#S     #\n#   A  #\n#    A #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#SS    #\n# H    #\n#   A  #\n#    A #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN. The head is at (3,2). To reach the nearest apple at (4,4), the snake should start moving right. Changing direction to RIGHT now allows the snake to head towards the apple efficiently. Moving down would keep the snake in the same column, requiring additional steps to the right. Choosing RIGHT now positions the snake closer to the apple and avoids potential body collisions in future moves. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n# S    #\n# SH   #\n#   A  #\n#    A #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# SS   #\n#  HA  #\n#    A #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4,3), moving DOWN. Possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. Moving RIGHT to (4,4) eats the apple (A), increasing the score and growing the snake.

The snake's head is at (4,3). Moving UP would take it to (3,3), which is empty. Moving LEFT to (4,2) and then to (4,1) (an apple) allows eating it in the next move. Choosing LEFT now starts this path. Since LEFT is a valid direction (not reversing), it's the optimal choice to reach the closest apple. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#AH    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe current direction is LEFT. The snake's head (H) is at position (4,2). Moving left to (4,1) leads to an apple ('A'), which allows the snake to eat it, increase the score, and grow. Other directions (UP or DOWN) avoid collisions but do not eat an apple. Since the goal is to maximize apples eaten, moving LEFT is optimal and safe.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#A     #\n#    A #\n#HS    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT. Moving further left would result in a collision with the wall. Turning UP or DOWN avoids immediate danger. Choosing UP allows the snake to move toward the apple at row 2, column 1 in subsequent moves. DOWN leads to a less promising path with no nearby apples. Therefore, UP is the best direction to avoid collision and aim for an apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#A     #\n#H   A #\n#S     #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#H     #\n#S   A #\n#S     #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake's head is at (2,1) moving UP. Valid moves are UP or RIGHT (LEFT leads to a wall). Moving UP to (1,1) is safe and positions the snake closer to the apple at (1,3). Choosing UP allows the snake to approach the apple efficiently. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#H A   #\n#S     #\n#S   A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake is currently moving UP. Moving UP again would hit the wall (#) at row 0. Moving LEFT would also hit the wall at column 0. The only valid direction is RIGHT, which moves the head to (1,2), an empty space. This avoids collision and positions the snake closer to the apple at (1,3) in future moves. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#SHA   #\n#S     #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is RIGHT. The head (H) is at (1,2), moving right towards the apple at (1,3). Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score and growing in length. Other directions: UP leads to a wall collision, DOWN moves to an empty cell but misses the apple. RIGHT is the best choice to maximize points safely.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#SSH   #\n#S     #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT. The snake's head is at (1,3) moving right. Valid moves are RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. Moving UP would hit the wall. Moving RIGHT to (1,4) is safe but doesn't reach an apple. Moving DOWN to (2,3) is safe and positions the snake towards the lower apples. Choosing DOWN avoids immediate collision and navigates towards apples in row 6.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#SSS   #\n#  H   #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake's head is at (2,3) moving DOWN. Possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. Moving DOWN leads to (3,3), which is safe. Moving RIGHT to (2,4) is also safe. The closest apple is at (3,5). Choosing RIGHT aligns the snake to move towards the apple by turning right and then down. This path avoids collisions and efficiently targets the nearest apple. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n# SS   #\n#  SH  #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (2,4) moving right. The nearest apple is at (3,5). To reach it, the snake can move down to (3,4) and then right to (3,5). Moving down is allowed (not a reversal) and positions the snake closer to other apples. Choosing DOWN avoids potential wall collision from moving further right and aligns the path toward more apples. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#  S   #\n#  SS  #\n#   HA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (3,4), moving DOWN. The adjacent apple at (3,5) can be eaten by turning RIGHT. Changing direction to RIGHT is allowed (not a reversal from DOWN) and moves the head into the apple, increasing the score. Moving DOWN or LEFT doesn't target an apple immediately. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#  S   #\n#  SS  #\n#   SH #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake's head is at (3,5) moving RIGHT. To eat the nearest apple at (4,5), the best move is DOWN. This avoids collision and increases the score. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#  S A #\n#  SS  #\n#   SS #\n#    H #\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN  \nThe snake's head is at (4,5) moving DOWN. The next move can be DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Continuing DOWN leads to (5,5), a safe space. From there, the next move to (6,5) would eat the apple. Choosing DOWN now is valid and aligns with reaching the nearest apple efficiently without collision.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The head (H) is at position (4,4) moving right towards the apple (A) at (4,5). Since the snake can continue in the same direction without reversing, moving RIGHT will allow it to eat the apple, increasing the score and growing in length. Other directions would avoid the apple or risk future collisions unnecessarily. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#   SH #\n#    A #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4,5) moving RIGHT. The available directions are UP, RIGHT, or DOWN. Moving DOWN to (5,5) leads to eating the apple (A), increasing the score, and safely growing the snake. Other directions don't reach an apple immediately. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n# A A  #\n#      #\n#   SS #\n#    H #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nThe current direction is DOWN. The snake's head is at (5,5). To reach the apple in row6, column3, moving LEFT now starts the westward movement towards the apple's column. Continuing DOWN would keep the head in the same column but moving into row6, requiring subsequent left moves. However, turning LEFT now allows the snake to begin aligning its position with the apple's column. Moving LEFT to (5,4) is safe and starts the path toward the apple. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#      #\n# A A  #\n#      #\n#    S #\n#   HS #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is LEFT, so possible moves are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. The snake's head is at (5,4). The closest apple is at (6,3). Moving DOWN to (6,4) positions the snake to reach the apple in the next move by turning LEFT. This path avoids collisions and efficiently targets the nearest apple. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n# A A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SS #\n#  AH  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN. The snake's head is at (6,4) moving DOWN, but the next DOWN move hits a wall. Possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT. Moving LEFT to (6,3) eats an apple, increasing the score and growing the snake. Moving RIGHT to (6,5) is safe but no apple. Choosing LEFT is optimal to eat the apple and avoid collision.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#    A #\n# A A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SS #\n#  HS  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (6,3) moving left. Possible directions are LEFT or UP (DOWN leads to a wall). Moving UP to (5,3) is safe and positions the snake to move towards apples.

The snake's head is at (5,3) and moving up. Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving RIGHT would collide with the body at (5,4). Moving UP to (4,3) is safe and keeps the snake in a central position, allowing flexibility to reach apples at (2,2) or (2,4) in future moves. Moving LEFT to (5,2) is also safe but leads closer to the left wall, which may limit future options. Choosing UP maintains a strategic path towards both apples. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#    A #\n# A A  #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#  S   #\n#  SS  #\n########\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#    A #\n# A A  #\n#      #\n#  SH  #\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n########\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#    A #\n# A A  #\n#   H  #\n#  SS  #\n#  S   #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#    A #\n# A H  #\n#   S  #\n#  SS  #\n#  S   #\n#    A #\n########\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#    A #\n# AHS  #\n#   S  #\n#  SS  #\n#      #\n#    A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT.

To eat the closest apple at (5,2), the snake should change direction to DOWN. Changing from LEFT to DOWN is allowed (not a reversal). Moving DOWN will move the head to (5,2), consuming the apple there and increasing the score. This path avoids collision and maximizes apple intake.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#   A  #\n# S    #\n# H    #\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe current direction is DOWN. The snake's head is at (5,2) and moving down will take it to (6,2), where there's an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score and grows the snake. The next move would require changing direction (e.g., LEFT or RIGHT) to avoid hitting the wall. Choosing DOWN now maximizes immediate points.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#A  A  #\n# S    #\n# S    #\n# H    #\n########\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#A  A  #\n#      #\n# S    #\n#HS    #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (6,1) moving LEFT, which is towards the wall. The next move LEFT would result in a collision. Possible directions are UP or DOWN. Moving DOWN leads to the wall. Thus, the only valid direction is UP to avoid collision and head towards the apples at (3,1). \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#A  A  #\n#      #\n#H     #\n#SS    #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is UP. The head (H) is at position (5,1), and the body segments (SS) are below it. Apples are located at (2,5), (3,1), and (3,4). Moving UP would take the head to (4,1), which is safe and moves closer to the apple at (3,1). Moving LEFT would hit the wall, causing a collision. Moving RIGHT would move the head to (5,2), which is safe but doesn't lead directly toward an apple. Choosing UP maintains the path toward the nearest apple at (3,1) without risking collision. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#A  A  #\n#H     #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n########\n\nThe current direction is UP. The snake's head is at position (4,1). Moving UP to (3,1) leads to an apple ('A'), which increases the score and grows the snake. LEFT would hit the wall, causing a collision. RIGHT moves to an empty space but doesn't collect an apple. Therefore, the optimal move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#H  AA #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake's head is at (3,1). Moving RIGHT allows the head to reach the nearest apples at (3,4) and (3,5) efficiently. Moving LEFT would hit the wall. Continuing UP moves away from the apples. Choosing RIGHT is the optimal path to eat an apple without collision. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#SH AA #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake's head (H) is moving right. Possible directions are UP, RIGHT, or DOWN (LEFT is invalid due to reversal). Moving DOWN would immediately collide with the body 'S' below the head. Moving RIGHT takes the head to an empty space, setting up to reach the nearby 'A' in the next move. Moving UP avoids collision but delays reaching the nearest apples. Choosing RIGHT allows the snake to safely progress toward the apples in the same row.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#SSHAA #\n#S     #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving RIGHT. The head is at position (3,3) (row 3, column 3). Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple at (3,4), increasing the score and growing the body. Since the current direction is RIGHT, the valid options are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. Moving RIGHT is the optimal choice to consume the apple and avoid immediate collision. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n# A   A#\n#SSSHA #\n#S     #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (3,4) moving RIGHT. The cell to the right (3,5) contains an apple. Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score and growing the body. This is the optimal move as it directly consumes an available resource. Choosing UP or DOWN would avoid the apple, reducing potential score. Since reversing direction (LEFT) is invalid, RIGHT is the best valid direction.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n# A   A#\n#SSSSHA#\n#S     #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is RIGHT. The head (H) is at (3,5) in the fourth row. The next position to the right is (3,6), which contains an apple (A). Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score and growing in length. After moving right, the new head will be at (3,6), and the body extends. The next direction can then be UP or DOWN to avoid the wall in subsequent moves. Choosing any other direction now would miss the opportunity to eat the apple. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n# A   A#\n#SSSSSH#\n#S A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at the fourth row, sixth column, moving RIGHT. The next move in the same direction would hit the wall. Valid directions are UP or DOWN. Moving UP to row 2, column 6 is safe and positions the head near the apple at (2,5). Choosing UP allows the next move to turn LEFT and eat the apple, increasing the score. \n\nAnswer: UP","",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The snake can move UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT. The closest apples are at (1,4), (1,2), and (2,5). Moving UP allows the snake to navigate towards the apples in the upper rows. Continuing RIGHT leads towards the wall with no immediate apples. Turning UP now positions the snake to reach (1,4) in three steps or (2,5) via a path. Choosing UP is optimal for accessing apples while avoiding collision risks.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n# A A  #\n#     A#\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe current direction is UP. The snake's head is at (3,4). Moving UP to (2,4) is safe and leads toward the apple at (1,4). The other directions (LEFT or RIGHT) do not immediately reach an apple.

The snake's head is at position (2,4). Moving UP will take it to (1,4), where there's an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score and grows the snake. Although moving UP now leads the head closer to the top wall (row 0), the next move can adjust direction to avoid collision. Choosing UP is valid and maximizes the immediate score gain. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n# A H  #\n#   S A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP  \nThe snake is currently moving UP but is about to hit the wall (the top boundary). The available directions are LEFT or RIGHT (DOWN is a reversal, which is invalid). The closest apple is at the same row (row 2, column 3) to the left of the head. Choosing LEFT allows the snake to immediately start moving toward that apple, avoiding collision and enabling it to eat the apple in the next move. Moving RIGHT would take the snake away from the nearest apple and toward the right wall, which is less optimal. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n# AHS  #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (1,3) moving left. Moving left to (1,2) eats the apple ('A'), which is safe and increases the score. Other directions like UP would collide with the wall, and DOWN doesn't lead to an apple immediately. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n# HSS  #\n#     A#\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT. The possible directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. Moving UP would hit the wall, so it's invalid. Moving LEFT continues the current direction to (1,1), which is safe but doesn't reach an apple. Moving DOWN to (2,2) is also safe and positions the snake closer to the apple at (3,3) in future moves. Choosing DOWN allows the snake to approach the nearest apple efficiently without immediate collision risks.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n# SS   #\n# H   A#\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is DOWN. The head is at (3,2). Moving DOWN would take it to (4,2), which is safe. The nearest apple is at (4,3), so after moving down, turning RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple next. Since reversing direction (UP) is impossible, the valid options are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. LEFT would hit the wall, so the choices are DOWN or RIGHT. Moving DOWN is safe and aligns with the current direction, providing a clear path to the apple in the next move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n# S    #\n# S   A#\n# HA   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at (3,2) and the current direction is DOWN. The closest apple is at (3,3). Turning RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple immediately. Moving DOWN or LEFT would not eat an apple. Changing direction to RIGHT is valid since it's not a reversal (DOWN to RIGHT is allowed). \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n# S    #\n# S   A#\n# SH   #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake's head is at position (4,3) moving RIGHT.

The head is at (4,3). Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving UP leads to (3,3), which is empty. Moving LEFT to (4,2) or RIGHT to (4,4) also leads to empty spaces. The apples are at (3,5), (5,1), and (5,3). To reach (5,3), the snake must turn RIGHT or LEFT and then maneuver downward. Moving RIGHT positions the snake closer to (5,3) and allows turning DOWN next. Choosing RIGHT now sets up a path to eat the apple in subsequent moves. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#   H  #\n#A A   #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving RIGHT. The valid directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. To reach the nearest apples, moving DOWN positions the snake closer to the apples at (5,3) and (5,1). Choosing DOWN allows the snake to head towards (5,4), then left to eat the apple at (5,3), followed by further left moves to collect more apples. This path is safer and more efficient for collecting multiple apples without immediate collision risks.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#A AH  #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (x=4, y=4) in the playable grid. The current direction is DOWN. The possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (since UP is a reversal). Moving LEFT allows the snake to eat the adjacent apple ('A') at (3,4), increasing the score and growing the snake. This move is safe and beneficial. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#   A  #\n#A HS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (5,3) moving LEFT. The closest apple is at (4,3), directly above the head. Turning UP allows the snake to eat this apple immediately, increasing the score and growing the snake. Moving LEFT would not reach an apple in the next step, and moving DOWN avoids apples. Choosing UP is the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#  HA  #\n#A S   #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake's head is at (4,3). Moving RIGHT to (4,4) allows it to eat the apple there, increasing the score and growing in length. This move is valid since the direction change from UP to RIGHT is allowed (not a reversal). No collision occurs with walls or the snake's body. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#    A #\n#  SH  #\n#A S   #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake's head is at (4,4) moving RIGHT. The closest apple is at (3,5). Moving RIGHT to (4,5) allows the snake to then turn UP to (3,5) and eat the apple. Choosing RIGHT maintains movement towards the apple without immediate collision. DOWN risks future collisions. UP also leads to the apple but may direct the snake towards walls after eating. RIGHT is safest.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#    A #\n#  SSH #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT. The snake's head is at (4,5) moving right. Moving right again leads into the wall (# at column 6), so invalid. Possible directions are UP or DOWN. The apple at (3,5) is directly above the head. Moving UP to eat it is safe and increases the score. Moving DOWN avoids the apple but is safe. Choosing UP is optimal to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#   A  #\n#  A   #\n#    H #\n#  SSS #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake's head is at (3,5) moving UP. To avoid collisions and reach an apple, moving LEFT positions the head at (3,4), closer to the apple at (2,3). This allows subsequent moves to UP then LEFT to eat the apple. UP and RIGHT don't immediately lead to apples and may risk future collisions. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#   A  #\n#  A   #\n#   HS #\n#   SS #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (3,4) moving LEFT. Possible moves are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. Moving DOWN leads to collision with body. Choosing between LEFT and UP. Both allow reaching the apple at (2,3) next move. Moving UP positions the snake closer to the apple and future apples. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#   A  #\n#  AH  #\n#   SS #\n#    S #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at row 2, column 4. The current direction is UP. Possible moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\nMoving UP leads to (1,4) which has an apple (A), allowing the snake to eat it and grow. However, this positions the snake near the top wall, limiting future movement and risking collision if moving UP again. \n\nMoving LEFT takes the head to (2,3), another apple. Eating this keeps the snake in a central area, providing more flexibility for subsequent moves (LEFT, UP, or DOWN) to navigate towards other apples like the one at (5,1). \n\nMoving RIGHT to (2,5) avoids apples and offers no growth. \n\nChoosing LEFT optimizes apple consumption and maintains safer positioning. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#   A  #\n#  HS  #\n#   SSA#\n#    S #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#  HA  #\n#  SS  #\n#   SSA#\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe current direction is UP. The snake's head is at (1,3). Moving UP would crash into the wall. Possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP (but UP is a wall). Moving RIGHT to (1,4) eats the apple (A), increasing the score. This is safe as (1,4) is not a wall or body part. Changing direction to RIGHT is allowed. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#  SHA #\n#  SS  #\n#   SSA#\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is RIGHT. The valid moves are RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. Moving UP leads to a wall (row 0, column 3) causing a collision. Moving DOWN results in the head hitting the body segment at (2,3). Moving RIGHT into (1,4) is safe and eats the apple. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The head (H) is at position (4,3), with an apple (A) directly to its left at (4,2). Moving LEFT allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score and growing in length. Changing direction to LEFT is permitted since it's not a reversal (from UP to LEFT is allowed). Moving UP or RIGHT would not result in eating an apple immediately. Therefore, the optimal move is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#    A #\n# A    #\n#      #\n# HS   #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is LEFT. To avoid collisions and reach an apple efficiently, moving UP positions the head closer to the apple at (2,2). This direction is valid (not a reversal) and safe. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#    A #\n# A    #\n# H    #\n# S    #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe current direction is UP. The snake's head is at (3,2) (row 3, column 2). Moving UP would take the head to (2,2), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the snake's length and score without causing a collision. Other directions (LEFT\/RIGHT) do not lead to an apple and are less optimal. Since reversing direction is not allowed, UP is the valid and best choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#    AA#\n# H    #\n# S    #\n# S    #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (2,2) moving UP. To reach the apples at (1,5) and (1,6), the optimal path starts by turning RIGHT. This allows the snake to navigate towards the apples efficiently without collision. Moving UP would lead towards the wall with no immediate gain, while moving LEFT takes the snake away from the apples. Choosing RIGHT initiates the path to the closest apples. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#    AA#\n# SH   #\n# S    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (2,3) moving right. Valid moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (can't reverse to LEFT). Moving right continues towards the wall. Moving UP allows the snake to head towards the apples in row 1. Moving DOWN starts towards the apple in row 6. The nearest apples are in row 1. Choosing UP positions the snake closer to eating an apple efficiently. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#  H AA#\n# SS   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe current direction is UP. The snake's head is at row 1, column 3 (0-based). Moving UP would hit the wall (row 0), so it's invalid. The valid options are LEFT or RIGHT. \n\nMoving LEFT takes the head to (1,2), a safe space. Moving RIGHT takes it to (1,4), also a safe space. Choosing RIGHT allows the snake to approach the apples at (1,5) and (1,6) in subsequent moves, while LEFT leads away from immediate apples. To maximize score potential, RIGHT is optimal.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#  SHAA#\n#  S   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake's head (H) is at position (1,4). Moving RIGHT to (1,5) will eat the apple there, increasing the score and growing the snake. This move is valid as it doesn't reverse direction (LEFT is forbidden). Moving DOWN would avoid collision but doesn't eat an apple. UP leads to a wall. Thus, the optimal move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#  SSHA#\n#  S   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#A     #\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#  SSSA#\n#    H #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe current direction is DOWN. The snake's head is at (2,5). Moving LEFT would change the direction to LEFT, moving the head to (2,4), which is safe. Moving DOWN continues the same direction to (3,5), also safe. Moving RIGHT to (2,6) is possible but leads towards the wall. The apples are in the lower-left, so turning LEFT starts the snake towards them. Choosing LEFT avoids potential collisions and positions the snake to approach the apples.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#   SSA#\n#   HS #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe current direction is LEFT, so the snake can move LEFT, UP, or DOWN. Moving UP would collide with the body segment at (1,4), causing a game over. Moving LEFT is safe but takes the snake away from the apples located in the lower rows. Moving DOWN avoids collision and directs the snake toward the apples in rows 5 and 6. Therefore, the optimal choice is DOWN to navigate toward the apples and avoid collisions. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#    SA#\n#   SS #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (3,4) moving DOWN. Possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. Moving DOWN to (4,4) is safe but doesn't approach apples. Moving RIGHT to (3,5) risks future collisions. Moving LEFT to (3,3) starts a path toward apples at (5,1) and (6,1) without immediate danger. Choosing LEFT optimizes apple-eating potential while avoiding collisions. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#     A#\n#   SS #\n#  HS  #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe current direction is LEFT. The snake's head is at (3,3). Possible moves are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. Moving DOWN takes the head to (4,3), which is empty and safe. This move positions the snake closer to the apples in the lower-left (rows 5 and 6, column 1). Choosing DOWN allows the snake to navigate towards these apples efficiently without immediate collision risks. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#     A#\n#   S  #\n#  SS  #\n#  H   #\n#A     #\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe current direction is DOWN. The snake's head is at (4,3). Moving DOWN would take it to (5,3), which is safe. Moving LEFT to (4,2) or RIGHT to (4,4) are also safe. However, the apples at (5,1) and (6,1) are closer to the left. By moving LEFT now, the snake positions itself to reach (5,1) in subsequent moves. Choosing LEFT avoids immediate collision and aligns the path toward the nearest apples. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The snake's head is at (3,3). Moving UP to (2,3) is safe and positions the snake closer to the apple at (2,5). From there, turning RIGHT in subsequent moves allows the snake to reach the apple efficiently. Other directions (LEFT or RIGHT) do not immediately lead to an apple and may require longer paths.

To reach the closest apple at (2,5), the snake should turn RIGHT. This changes the direction to RIGHT, allowing the head to move towards (2,4) and then (2,5) in the next step to eat the apple. Turning RIGHT now avoids collision and aligns the path towards the nearest apple. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#  SH A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A    A#\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is RIGHT. The head is at position (3,4) (third row, fourth column). The nearest apple is to the right at (3,6). Moving RIGHT will take the snake to (3,5), safe and closer to the apple. While moving DOWN or UP avoids immediate danger but doesn't approach an apple. The optimal choice is to continue RIGHT to reach the apple. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#   SHA#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A    A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (2,5) moving right towards an apple at (2,6). Moving RIGHT will eat the apple, but the next move must avoid the wall. Changing direction to DOWN allows the snake to move towards row 6 where apples are present. Choosing DOWN avoids collision and positions the snake closer to existing apples.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#    SA#\n#    H #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A    A#\n########\n\nThe current direction is DOWN. The snake's head is at (3,5). Possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. Moving RIGHT positions the snake closer to the apple at (6,6) by aligning it in the same column. This allows the snake to proceed downward directly toward the apple without collision. Choosing RIGHT is optimal to reach the apple efficiently. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#    SH#\n#      #\n#      #\n#A    A#\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is RIGHT. Moving RIGHT would cause the head to hit the wall (column 7 in row 3 is a '#'). Therefore, the valid options are UP or DOWN. Moving UP allows the snake to eat the apple at (row 2, column 6), increasing the score and growing in length. Moving DOWN leads to an empty space, which is safe but doesn't provide a point. Choosing UP is the optimal move to avoid collision and gain a point.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#      #\n#     H#\n#   ASS#\n#      #\n#      #\n#A    A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nTo determine the next move, we analyze the snake's position and possible directions. The head (H) is at (3,6), moving UP. Valid options are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **UP**: Moves to (2,6), which is safe but no apple. The snake would continue toward the top, risking a future wall collision.\n- **LEFT**: Moves to (3,5), safe and starts a path toward the apple at (4,4). This direction allows the snake to eventually turn DOWN and reach the apple in subsequent moves.\n- **RIGHT**: Moves to (3,7), safe but leads toward the right edge. This could set a path for the apple at (7,7) but requires more steps.\n\nChoosing **LEFT** prioritizes the closest apple (4,4) and avoids potential wall collisions from moving UP repeatedly. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#    HS#\n#   A S#\n#      #\n#      #\n#A    A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT. The snake's head (H) is at (3,6) moving left. To reach the apple at (4,5), the optimal move is DOWN. Moving DOWN positions the head at (4,6), allowing the next move to be LEFT into (4,5) to eat the apple.

To eat the nearest apple at (3,4), changing direction to LEFT is valid (not a reversal) and allows immediate consumption of the apple. Moving DOWN or RIGHT would not target the apple. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#    SS#\n#   HS #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#A    A#\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#    S #\n#   SS #\n#   H  #\n#     A#\n#A    A#\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is DOWN. The head is at (4,4). Possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (since reversing to UP is not allowed). Moving DOWN to (5,4) is safe but doesn't reach an apple immediately. Moving RIGHT to (4,5) starts a path toward the apple at (5,6), requiring two subsequent moves (RIGHT then DOWN). Moving LEFT leads away from apples. Choosing RIGHT optimizes the path toward the nearest apple (5,6) while avoiding collision. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SS #\n#   SH #\n#     A#\n#A    A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT. The snake's head is at (4,5) moving right. To reach the closest apple at (5,6), moving DOWN now allows the snake to position itself for a subsequent right move to eat the apple. Moving RIGHT would take the head closer to the wall, limiting future options. Choosing DOWN avoids the risk of collision with the body (UP is blocked by S) and sets a path toward the apple. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   S  #\n#   SS #\n#    HA#\n#A    A#\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN.

The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#      #\n# A    #\n#   S  #\n#   SS #\n#    SH#\n#A    A#\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","action":"RIGHT"}

The head (H) is in row 4, column 4 (playable area). To the right of H is an apple (A) at the same row. Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score and growing the body. Since the current direction is UP, changing to RIGHT is allowed. This move is safe and beneficial. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#  SH  #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#   S  #\n#AA H  #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (5,4) moving DOWN. Possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. Moving LEFT leads towards the apples in row 5. Choosing LEFT allows the snake to eat the apple at (5,2) in the next move, increasing the score. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#AAHS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (5,3) moving LEFT. The apples are at (5,1), (5,2), and (2,3). Moving LEFT will take the head to (5,2), which contains an apple. This will increase the score and grow the snake. Other directions (UP\/DOWN) do not lead to apples immediately. Since the current direction is LEFT, choosing LEFT is valid and optimal.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#AHSSA #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (5,2) moving LEFT. Possible moves are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. Moving LEFT allows the snake to eat the apple at (5,1), increasing the score and growing the snake without collision. UP and DOWN are safe but do not yield points. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#HSSSA #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT, which would take it into a wall at column 0. To avoid collision, the snake must change direction. The valid options are UP or DOWN. Moving UP allows the snake to navigate towards the apples located in rows 2 and 3. Choosing UP positions the snake closer to these apples, providing a path to reach them in subsequent moves. Moving DOWN leads away from the apples and offers no immediate benefit. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#  A   #\n#H     #\n#SSS A #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (4,1) moving UP. Possible moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. LEFT leads into a wall. UP moves to (3,1), a safe space. RIGHT moves to (4,2), also safe. To reach the nearest apple at (3,3), moving RIGHT now starts the snake towards that apple. UP continues upward but doesn't immediately approach the apple. Choosing RIGHT is better for positioning to eat the apple next.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#  A   #\n#SH    #\n#SS  A #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake's head (H) is at position (4,2). Moving UP would take the head to (3,2), which is safe and positions it to reach the apple at (3,3) next. Moving DOWN leads to collision with the body at (5,2). Moving RIGHT continues in the current direction but doesn't eat an apple immediately. Choosing UP avoids collision and sets up the shortest path to the nearest apple. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n# HA   #\n#SS    #\n#S   A #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP. The snake's head is at (3,2). The adjacent apple is to the RIGHT (position 3,3). Since the current direction is UP, turning RIGHT is allowed. Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score and growing longer. Other directions (UP or LEFT) don't lead to immediate rewards. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n# SH   #\n#SS    #\n#S   A #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#      #\n#  HA  #\n# SS   #\n#SS    #\n#    A #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is currently at position (row 2, column 3) with an adjacent apple (A) to the right (column 4). The current direction is UP, so the snake cannot move DOWN. Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score and length. Moving UP or LEFT avoids the apple but doesn't provide growth. Choosing RIGHT is optimal to consume the apple safely without collision. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#  SH  #\n# SS  A#\n#SS    #\n#    A #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake's head is at position (2,4) (row 2, column 4). Possible moves are RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. Moving DOWN takes the head to (3,4), which is empty. This positions the snake closer to the apple at (3,6). Choosing DOWN avoids immediate collision and moves toward the nearest apple. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#  SS  #\n# SSH A#\n# S    #\n#    A #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (3,4), moving DOWN. Valid directions are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. LEFT leads to collision with body. Moving DOWN to (4,4) is safe but no apple. Moving RIGHT to (3,5) is safe, enabling a path to the apple at (3,6) in the next move. Choosing RIGHT allows the snake to approach the nearest apple efficiently. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#  SS  #\n# SSSHA#\n#      #\n#    A #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (3,5) moving RIGHT. The next cell (3,6) is an apple ('A'). Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple safely without colliding with walls or its body. Other directions (UP or DOWN) don't lead to apples and are less optimal. The snake cannot reverse to LEFT.

To eat the nearest apple at (4,4), turning RIGHT now allows the head to move to (4,3), then RIGHT again to (4,4) in the next step to eat the apple. Moving LEFT causes a collision with the body at (4,1). Continuing UP keeps the snake away from immediate apples. Thus, RIGHT is the optimal direction. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe snake is currently moving RIGHT. The head (H) is at position (4,3). Moving RIGHT will take it to (4,4), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score and grows the snake. There are no walls or body segments in the immediate next cell.

The head is at (4,3), and there are apples at (1,3), (3,1), and (3,4). The snake can choose between UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving RIGHT allows the snake to reach the apple at (3,4) in two steps without risking collision with its body. Choosing RIGHT now changes the direction to RIGHT, moving the head to (4,4) (no apple), then UP to (3,4) (apple eaten). This path avoids future collisions and maximizes apple consumption. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving RIGHT. To eat an apple, the best option is to turn UP. Moving UP from the current position (row 4, column 4) leads to row 3, column 4, which has an apple. This direction is valid since UP is not a reversal of RIGHT. Eating this apple increases the score and grows the snake.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#A  H  #\n#  AS  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#A HS  #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (3,3), moving LEFT. To eat the nearest apple at (4,3), changing direction to DOWN allows the head to move into that position safely. This avoids collision and increases the score. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#A SS  #\n#  H  A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN. The snake can move DOWN, LEFT (RIGHT direction), or RIGHT (LEFT direction). The closest apple is at (4,6). Moving LEFT (changing direction to RIGHT) allows the snake to start moving east towards the apple. This path is safe and leads to the nearest apple. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#A S   #\n# HS  A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4,1), moving LEFT. Moving left would collide with the wall. Valid directions are UP or DOWN. Moving UP to (3,1) eats an apple (A), increasing the score and growing the snake. Moving DOWN to (5,1) is safe but doesn't eat an apple. Choosing UP is optimal to gain points and avoid collision.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#AH    #\n# SS  A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is UP. The head is at position (3,2). The adjacent cell to the left (column 1) contains an apple ('A'). Moving LEFT is allowed (not a reversal) and allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score. Other directions (UP or RIGHT) do not lead to an apple. Choosing LEFT is optimal for growth.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#HS    #\n# SS  A#\n#      #\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (3,1) and is currently moving LEFT. Moving LEFT would cause the head to hit the wall (position (3,0)), resulting in a game over. Turning RIGHT is invalid since it reverses the current direction. Moving DOWN would take the head to (4,1), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'), causing a collision. The only valid direction is UP, moving the head to (2,1), which is safe and avoids collisions. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#H     #\n#SS    #\n# S   A#\n#      #\n# A    #\n########\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#SH    #\n#SS    #\n#     A#\n#      #\n# A    #\n########\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n# HA   #\n#SS    #\n#S     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (1,2) and is currently moving UP. The snake cannot reverse direction to DOWN. Moving UP would hit the wall at row 0, causing a collision. The viable options are LEFT or RIGHT. \n\nMoving LEFT to (1,1) avoids immediate danger but does not eat the nearby apple at (1,3). Moving RIGHT to (1,3) eats the apple, increasing the score and growing the snake. After moving RIGHT, the direction changes to RIGHT, allowing the snake to safely proceed towards other apples. This is the optimal choice to maximize points and avoid collisions.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n# SH   #\n#SS  A #\n#S     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is RIGHT. Possible moves are RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. Moving UP leads to a wall collision. Moving RIGHT continues into a narrowing path. Moving DOWN positions the snake towards the center and closer to apples. Choosing DOWN avoids the wall and opens paths to reach apples safely.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n# SS   #\n#SSH A #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe current direction is DOWN. The snake's head is at position (2,3). The possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving LEFT to (2,2) would collide with the body ('S'), so it's invalid. Moving DOWN to (3,3) is safe but doesn't eat an apple. Moving RIGHT to (2,4) is safe and positions the snake to reach the apple at (2,5) in the next move. Choosing RIGHT allows the snake to eat the nearest apple in the subsequent step, making it the optimal choice. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","","",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The available apples are at (0,5), (6,5), and (6,6). Moving UP would take the head to (3,3), which is safe but doesn't lead directly to an apple. Moving LEFT takes the head to (4,2), which is empty. Moving RIGHT (changing direction to RIGHT) positions the head at (4,4), starting a path toward the apples in row 6. From there, the snake can turn DOWN in subsequent moves to reach the apples at (6,5) and (6,6) efficiently. Since reversing direction to DOWN isn't allowed immediately, RIGHT is the optimal choice to navigate toward the closest apples without collision.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#    AA#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (4,4) moving RIGHT. Valid moves are RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. The closest apples are in row 6 (positions (6,5) and (6,6)). Moving DOWN now (to (5,4)) starts the snake toward these apples. Continuing RIGHT would delay the approach. Choosing DOWN allows the snake to reach the apples in fewer steps and avoids potential risks of moving further right toward the wall. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   H  #\n#    AA#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    H #\n#    AA#\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving RIGHT. The head is at position (5,5) in a 0-based grid. The available directions are RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. Moving DOWN leads to an apple at (6,5), which is the optimal choice to increase the score and grow the snake. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#    S #\n#    HA#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at the bottom row, moving DOWN. The next move DOWN would hit the wall. The adjacent cell to the right (A) is an apple. To eat the apple and avoid the wall, the snake should turn RIGHT. This is allowed since it's not a reverse direction. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#  A S #\n#    SH#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake's head is at (6,6) moving RIGHT. Moving RIGHT would hit the wall '#', so it's invalid. Reversing direction to LEFT is not allowed. The only valid moves are UP or DOWN. Moving DOWN to (7,6) is a wall. Thus, the snake must move UP to (5,6), which is safe. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#  A  H#\n#    SS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (5,6), moving UP. Valid directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving RIGHT would hit the wall (#) at column 7, so it's invalid. \n\nMoving UP takes the head to (4,6), an empty space. This is safe and positions the head closer to the apple at (4,5). Next, turning LEFT in the subsequent move would allow eating that apple. \n\nChoosing LEFT now moves the head to (5,5), which is safe but requires more steps to reach the nearest apple. \n\nThus, the optimal move is UP to avoid collision and efficiently target the nearest apple. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    AH#\n#  A  S#\n#     S#\n########\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#    AA#\n#      #\n#      #\n#    HS#\n#  A  S#\n#     S#\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is LEFT. The head is at (4,5), and moving left to (4,4) is safe. This allows the snake to proceed toward the apple at (5,2) by moving down and left in subsequent steps without immediate collision. Turning UP or DOWN either doesn't reach apples quickly or causes a collision. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#    AA#\n#      #\n#      #\n#   HSS#\n#  A  S#\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#    AA#\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SSS#\n#  AH  #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is DOWN. The head (H) is at (5,4), adjacent to an apple (A) at (5,3). Moving LEFT would allow the snake to eat the apple, increasing its length and score. Since the snake cannot reverse direction (UP), LEFT is a valid input. Moving DOWN or RIGHT avoids the apple but provides no growth. Choosing LEFT optimizes apple consumption without causing a collision. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#    AA#\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SSS#\n#  HS  #\n#    A #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (5,3) moving left. Possible directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. Moving down to (6,3) is safe and positions the snake closer to the apple at (6,5). Choosing DOWN avoids collision and aims to eat the nearest apple. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#    AA#\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SS #\n#  SS  #\n#  H A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake is moving DOWN towards the bottom wall (#), which will cause a collision. To avoid this, the snake must turn LEFT or RIGHT. Moving LEFT leads to an empty space. Moving RIGHT also leads to an empty space. Choosing RIGHT positions the snake closer to the apple at (6,5), allowing it to potentially eat the apple in the next move. Therefore, the best direction is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","","",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The available directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. None of these directions immediately lead to an apple. To reach the nearest apples in row 5 (positions (5,1) and (5,3)), the snake must change direction to allow future downward movement. Moving LEFT now positions the snake closer to (5,1) and provides flexibility to access both apples in row 5. Moving RIGHT targets (5,3) but limits options.

The closest apple is at (6,6) to the right. Moving RIGHT leads the head to (6,5), which is safe and positions the snake to eat the apple in the next step. Turning UP (to (5,4)) avoids immediate danger but moves away from the nearby apple. DOWN is invalid (wall collision). Choosing RIGHT maximizes the chance to eat the apple, increasing the score and growing the snake safely. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# SSSHA#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT. The snake is moving right, with its head at (6,5) in a row with an apple at (6,6). Choosing **RIGHT** allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score. After eating, the next move must change direction (e.g., UP) to avoid hitting the wall. However, since the goal is to maximize apples eaten, the optimal choice is to move right and consume the apple now. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n# SSSSH#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (6,6) moving RIGHT. The next move to the right (column 7) is a wall, causing a collision. The snake cannot reverse direction (LEFT), so the possible moves are UP or DOWN. Moving DOWN leads to row 7 (a wall), so the only safe option is UP to (5,6), which is empty. This avoids collision and allows the snake to continue safely.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A   H#\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (5,6) moving UP.

The snake's head is at position (4,3). The closest apple is at (5,2) (row 5, column 2). To reach this apple, the snake can turn LEFT to move towards column 2 and then proceed DOWN. Since the snake cannot reverse direction, LEFT is a valid move here. Moving LEFT now positions the snake closer to the apple and sets up a path to eat it in the next move. This avoids collision with walls and itself, as the path is clear. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# H    #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (4,2) moving LEFT. To eat the apple at (5,2), the snake should turn DOWN. Moving DOWN is allowed (not a reversal) and leads directly to the apple. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S    #\n# H    #\n#     A#\n########\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# SH   #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT. The snake's head is at (5,3) moving right. To reach the apple at (6,5), moving DOWN now positions the head closer to the apple. The next moves can then be RIGHT twice to eat it safely without collisions. Choosing DOWN avoids immediate reversal and sets a path toward the nearest apple. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  S   #\n#  H  A#\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN, but moving further down would result in a collision with the wall at row 7. The snake cannot reverse direction (UP), so valid options are LEFT or RIGHT. \n\nMoving LEFT would take the head to (6,2), which is empty but away from the apple at (6,6). Moving RIGHT allows the snake to head towards the apple at (6,6). After moving RIGHT, the next positions can continue in the same direction (RIGHT) to reach the apple, increasing the score. Choosing RIGHT avoids immediate collision and positions the snake to eat the apple efficiently. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SH A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT. The snake can't reverse to LEFT. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Moving DOWN leads to a wall (row 7), which is a collision. UP is safe, leading to row 5. RIGHT moves the head towards the apple at (6,7). Choosing RIGHT allows the snake to approach the nearest apple without collision. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SHA#\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake's head is at (6,5), moving right towards (6,6) which contains an apple ('A'). Choosing RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score by 1. After eating, the snake's head moves to (6,6), and the next direction can be UP to avoid hitting the wall in the subsequent move. Reversing direction is not allowed, so DOWN would lead to a wall collision, and UP is a safe path. However, the optimal immediate choice is RIGHT to consume the apple and grow. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SSH#\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is RIGHT. The head (H) is at position (6,6), moving right would collide with the wall (#). The valid options are UP or DOWN. Moving DOWN leads to a wall (row 7), so only UP is safe. Choosing UP moves the head to (5,6), avoiding collision. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     H#\n#    SS#\n########\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    HS#\n#     S#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT. The snake's head is at (5,5) moving left. Possible moves are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. Moving DOWN leads to (6,5), which is safe but closer to the wall. Moving LEFT continues the current direction to (5,4), which is empty. Moving UP to (4,5) is also safe. None of these moves eat an apple immediately. However, moving UP positions the snake closer to the apple at (2,4) and (1,5). Considering future paths, moving UP provides more flexibility to navigate towards available apples. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#    H #\n#    SS#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (4,5) moving UP. To reach the nearest apple at (2,4), the snake should turn LEFT to move towards (4,4), aligning it to approach the apple. Moving UP keeps the current direction but doesn't directly target the nearest apple. Turning LEFT avoids immediate collisions and positions the snake optimally for subsequent moves towards the apple. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#   HS #\n#    S #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT  \nThe snake's head is at (4,4) moving left. Possible directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. Moving UP to (3,4) avoids immediate collision and starts a path toward the apple at (2,4). Choosing UP allows the snake to align toward the closest apple. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#   A  #\n#   H  #\n#   SS #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#   H  #\n#   S  #\n#   SSA#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. The closest apples are in row 1 (columns 2 and 3) and row 2 (column 5). Moving UP positions the snake closer to the apples in row 1. Turning LEFT or RIGHT does not immediately reach an apple and may lead to longer paths. Continuing UP is optimal to approach the nearest apples efficiently.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#  AA  #\n#    A #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is UP. To reach the nearest apple at (1,3), the best move is to continue moving UP. This positions the snake closer to the apple without risking an immediate collision. Moving LEFT or RIGHT would take the snake away from the closest apples. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#  AA  #\n#  H A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is UP. Moving UP would take the head to row 1, column 3, which is an apple ('A'), allowing the snake to eat it and grow. The other directions (LEFT or RIGHT) do not immediately lead to an apple. Choosing UP is valid and avoids collision while maximizing score gain.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#  HA  #\n#  S A #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe current direction is UP. The snake's head (H) is at (1,3), moving upward. Moving UP would hit the wall. The snake can turn LEFT or RIGHT. Turning RIGHT allows the head to move to (1,4) and eat the apple (A), increasing the score and growing the snake. This avoids collision and is the optimal move. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#  SH  #\n#A S A #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is RIGHT, so it can move RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. Moving UP would hit the wall. Moving RIGHT continues the current path but doesn't eat an apple. Moving DOWN brings the snake to row 2, column 4 (empty), allowing it to then turn RIGHT to eat the apple at (2,5) in the next move. This path positions the snake closer to the central apples and avoids potential future collisions.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#  SS  #\n#A  HA #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#  SS  #\n#A  SHA#\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#  SS  #\n#A  SSH#\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#   S  #\n#A  SSS#\n#  A  H#\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN. The snake's head is at (4,7). Moving LEFT changes direction to LEFT, moving to (4,6), which is safe. This positions the snake to reach the apple at (4,4) in subsequent moves. Choosing DOWN continues towards the apple at (7,7) but risks future collision with the wall. RIGHT leads to immediate collision. LEFT is the optimal choice to eat an apple and avoid danger.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#A  SSS#\n#  A HS#\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is LEFT. The possible moves are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. Moving UP leads to a collision with the body at (2,5). Moving DOWN is safe but doesn't immediately reach an apple. Moving LEFT to (3,4) is safe and positions the snake closer to the apple at (3,3). \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#A   SS#\n#  AHSS#\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (3,4), moving left. Moving left to (3,3) leads to an apple (A), which is safe to eat. Other directions (UP or DOWN) do not reach an apple and are less optimal. Since moving left is allowed (current direction is LEFT) and avoids collision, the optimal move is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#A   SS#\n#  HSSS#\n#    A #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#A    S#\n#  SSSS#\n#  H A #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction (UP is invalid). The possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. \n\nThe snake's head (H) is at (4,3). Apples are at (2,1), (4,5), and (6,6). Moving RIGHT to (4,4) positions the snake closer to the apple at (4,5) in the next move. Continuing DOWN leads to an empty space (5,3) but no immediate apple. LEFT moves away from all apples. Choosing RIGHT optimizes the path to the nearest apple (4,5) without collision. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n#  SSSS#\n#  SHA #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake's head (H) is at position (4,4). Moving RIGHT into (4,5) leads to an apple (A), which is safe and increases the score. Moving UP to (3,4) collides with the body ('S'), and moving DOWN to (5,4) is safe but doesn't eat the apple. Choosing RIGHT is optimal to eat the apple and grow. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Choosing DOWN now positions the snake to reach the nearest apple efficiently. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  AH  #\n#    A #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (5,4) moving DOWN. To eat the nearest apple at (5,3), turning LEFT allows the head to move into the apple, increasing the score. Moving DOWN would miss the apple, and moving RIGHT leads to an empty space. Since turning LEFT is a valid direction (not reversing), it's the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#  HS  #\n#    A #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (5,3) moving LEFT. Changing direction to UP allows the head to move to (4,3) where there's an apple. This results in eating the apple, increasing the score, and growing the snake. Other directions (LEFT or DOWN) don't immediately reach an apple. UP is the optimal choice here.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#  SS  #\n# A  A #\n########\n\nTo determine the next direction, the snake's head (H) is at position (4,3) (row 4, column 3). The current direction is UP. The snake cannot reverse direction to DOWN. The apples are at (2,5), (6,1), and (6,5). Moving UP keeps the snake in an empty space but doesn't immediately approach an apple. Moving LEFT starts a path toward the apple at (6,1), but this requires multiple direction changes and moving DOWN, which is not allowed from the current direction. Moving RIGHT allows the snake to head toward the apple at (2,5) with fewer steps: moving RIGHT to (4,4), then RIGHT to (4,5), and UP twice to reach (2,5). This path avoids collisions and efficiently targets the nearest accessible apple. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  SH  #\n#  S   #\n# A  A #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is RIGHT. Valid moves are RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. \n\n- Moving RIGHT takes the head to (4,5), an empty space. This maintains the current path and reduces the column distance to the apples at (2,5) and (6,5), allowing future moves to target either. \n- Moving UP or DOWN also avoids collisions but doesn't provide a shorter path to apples compared to RIGHT. \n\nChoosing RIGHT keeps the snake aligned to efficiently reach the nearest apples in subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  SSH #\n#      #\n# A  A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at (4,5), moving right. The snake can choose to continue RIGHT, turn UP, or DOWN (no reversal). Apples are at (2,5), (6,2), and (6,5). Moving DOWN allows the head to reach (6,5) in two steps to eat an apple, while moving UP targets (2,5). Choosing DOWN positions the snake closer to multiple apples (6,5 and 6,2), enabling efficient pathing. Continuing RIGHT leads toward a wall. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#   SS #\n#    H #\n# A  A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN. Since the snake is moving DOWN, possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (no reversal). The snake's head is at (5,5). Moving DOWN to (6,5) leads to an apple ('A'), which allows the snake to eat it, grow, and increase the score. Other directions do not lead to apples. The next position (6,5) is valid and not a collision. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#A   A #\n#      #\n#   SS #\n#    S #\n# A  H #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN. The head is at (6,5). Moving DOWN would hit the wall. Possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT. Moving LEFT takes the head to (6,4), a safe space. Moving RIGHT leads to (6,6), but subsequent RIGHT moves would hit the wall. Choosing LEFT allows the snake to approach the apple at (6,2). \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#A   A #\n#      #\n#    S #\n#    S #\n# A HS #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (6,4) moving left. Possible directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. Moving LEFT leads to (6,3), which is safe and moves closer to the apple at (6,2). Moving DOWN results in a wall collision.

The snake's head is at position (4,3). Moving RIGHT would take the head to (4,4), which is safe. This sets up the next move to (4,5) where there's an apple. Since the snake can't reverse direction, RIGHT is a valid move and the best path towards the nearest apple. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n# A    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   HA #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake's head (H) is at (4,4), moving right towards (4,5), which contains an apple (A). Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score and growing in length. Turning UP or DOWN would avoid the apple, which is suboptimal. The snake cannot reverse direction to LEFT. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n# A    #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#   SH #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n# A    #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#    S #\n#    HA#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is DOWN. The head (H) is at (5,5), and there's an apple (A) to its right at (5,6). Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing its length and score. Turning RIGHT is valid since it's not a reversal (DOWN → RIGHT is allowed). Moving DOWN would eventually lead to a wall, and LEFT avoids the apple. Thus, the optimal move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#    S #\n#    SH#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (5,6) moving RIGHT. Moving RIGHT again leads to a wall, which is fatal. The snake must turn UP or DOWN. Moving UP to (4,6) is safe and positions the snake closer to the apples at (3,3) and (1,1\/4). Moving DOWN to (6,6) moves away from the apples. Choosing UP allows navigating towards the apples in subsequent moves. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#     H#\n#    SS#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (4,6), moving UP. Valid directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving RIGHT would hit the wall. To reach the nearest apple at (3,3), moving LEFT starts the snake westward. Moving UP keeps the snake aligned but doesn't immediately approach an apple. Choosing LEFT allows the snake to begin navigating towards the apple at (3,3) efficiently. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#    HS#\n#     S#\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#  A H #\n#    SS#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe current direction is UP. The snake's head is at (3,5) and needs to move without reversing direction. Possible moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving UP leads towards an apple at (1,5) but requires another move. Moving LEFT starts the approach to the apple at (3,3) in two steps. Moving RIGHT approaches the wall and is risky. LEFT allows progression towards the apple while maintaining maneuverability. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#  AHS #\n#    S #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT. The snake can move LEFT, UP, or DOWN. Moving LEFT into (3,3) eats the apple there, increasing the score and growing the snake. UP and DOWN are safe but don't eat apples. Optimal choice is LEFT. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n# A  A #\n# A    #\n#  HSS #\n#    S #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT. The snake's head is at (3,3) moving left. Apples are at (1,2), (1,5), and (2,2). Moving LEFT (current direction) leads to (3,2), which has no apple. To reach the nearest apple at (2,2), changing direction to UP is optimal. Moving UP to (2,3) allows the next move to turn LEFT to (2,2) and eat the apple. This path avoids collisions and efficiently targets the closest apple. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n# A  A #\n# AH   #\n#  SSS #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is UP. The head is at position (2,3). Moving UP would take the head to (1,3), an empty space. Moving LEFT to (2,2) eats an apple ('A'), increasing the score. Moving RIGHT to (2,4) is safe but no apple. Choosing LEFT allows the snake to eat the apple, grow, and avoid collision. The direction change from UP to LEFT is valid (not a reversal). \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n# A  A #\n# HS   #\n#  SSS #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n# H  A #\n# SS   #\n#  SSS #\n#      #\n# A A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","","","",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The head (H) is at (2,4), and there's an apple (A) to the left at (2,3). Moving LEFT allows the snake to eat the apple, grow in length, and avoid collisions. Moving UP would take the head closer to the wall without immediate benefit, and moving RIGHT leads to an empty space. Choosing LEFT is optimal for eating the apple safely. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#     A#\n#  HS  #\n#   S  #\n# A    #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is LEFT. The head is at (2,3), and the closest apple is at (4,2). Moving DOWN to (3,3) positions the snake closer to this apple. From there, turning LEFT and then DOWN allows the snake to reach the apple in subsequent moves.

Apples are at (3,2), (2,6), and (5,3). The closest accessible apple is at (3,2). Moving LEFT now allows the snake to reach (4,2), then UP to (3,2) to eat the apple. Since the current direction is UP, LEFT is a valid direction and the shortest path to the nearest apple. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n# A    #\n# H    #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is LEFT. To eat an apple and grow, the best move is to change direction to UP. This allows the snake to move to (3,2), where there's an apple. This direction is valid since UP is not a reverse of LEFT. Eating this apple increases the snake's length and score. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n# H    #\n# S    #\n#  A A #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is UP. The possible valid moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving UP takes the snake to (2,3), which is safe. Moving LEFT takes it to (3,2), and RIGHT to (3,4), both also safe. The nearest apples are at (2,5), (5,3), and (5,5). To reach the apple at (2,5), moving UP now is the first step in the shortest path (UP followed by RIGHT twice). Choosing UP starts the snake toward this apple without any immediate risk. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#      #\n# H   A#\n# S    #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is UP. The head is at position (row 2, column 2). The available directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving UP would take the head to (row 1, column 2), but this path doesn't lead to an apple and may risk hitting the wall later. Turning LEFT moves the head leftward but away from the nearest apple. Choosing RIGHT allows the snake to start moving towards the apple at (row 2, column 6), which is the closest and reachable without immediate collision. This direction avoids reversal and positions the snake to eat the apple efficiently. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n# SH  A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (2,3) moving right. The available directions are RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. Moving RIGHT continues toward the apple at (2,6) but risks future collisions near the wall. Moving DOWN leads toward the apple at (5,3) with more central positioning and access to other apples. Choosing DOWN avoids immediate collision and aligns with safer paths to multiple apples. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#  S  A#\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (3,3) moving DOWN. The next move options are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. Moving DOWN to (4,3) is safe and leads toward the apple at (5,3). Choosing DOWN now allows the snake to reach the apple in the next move, maximizing the score. Reversing direction (UP) is invalid, and changing direction to LEFT\/RIGHT doesn't lead to apples faster. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#  S   #\n#  H   #\n#  A A #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#A S   #\n#  S   #\n#  H A #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nTo avoid collision and aim for the nearest apple (located at the same row, two steps to the right), the optimal move is RIGHT. This direction allows the snake to safely reach the apple in the next steps without reversing and without colliding with walls or its body.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#A     #\n#  S   #\n#  SHA #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake's head is at (5,4) (row 5, column 4). Moving RIGHT to (5,5) allows the snake to eat the apple ('A') there, increasing the score and growing the snake. This direction is valid as it doesn't reverse the current direction (RIGHT). Other directions (UP\/DOWN) avoid immediate collision but miss the apple. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#A     #\n#  S   #\n#  SSH #\n#    A #\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#A A   #\n#  S   #\n#  SSS #\n#    H #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is DOWN, but moving down would hit the wall. The snake must turn LEFT or RIGHT. Moving LEFT would take the head to (6,4), which is safe but limits future upward movement due to body collision. Moving RIGHT leads to (6,6), allowing the snake to turn upward next without collision. Choosing RIGHT provides a safer path towards potential future apples. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#A A   #\n#      #\n#  SSS #\n#    SH#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (6,6), moving RIGHT. Since the next cell to the right is a wall (#), continuing RIGHT would result in a collision. Reversing direction to LEFT is not allowed. The viable options are UP or DOWN. Moving DOWN to row 7 leads to a wall. Thus, the only safe direction is UP to (5,6), which is empty. This avoids collision and keeps the snake alive. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#A A   #\n#      #\n#   SSH#\n#    SS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (5,6) moving UP. Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving LEFT to (5,5) collides with the body (S). Moving RIGHT to (5,7) hits the wall. Only UP to (4,6) is safe. \n\nAnswer: UP","","","",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The snake can move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving UP continues away from the apples in row 5. To reach the apples, the snake must turn. Turning LEFT allows the snake to move towards column 2, then down to row 5, accessing apples at (5,1) or (5,3) in fewer steps. Turning RIGHT leads to apples at (5,3) or (5,6), but (5,6) requires more steps. LEFT provides the shortest path to an apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# H    #\n#A A  A#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 2) moving LEFT. Apples are located at (5, 1), (5, 3), and (5, 5). Continuing LEFT leads to (4, 1), which is not an apple. Turning UP moves away from the apples. Turning DOWN to (5, 2) positions the snake closer to apples at (5, 1) and (5, 3). From (5, 2), the next move can be LEFT or RIGHT to eat an apple. Choosing DOWN now maximizes future opportunities to reach apples quickly. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#AHA  A#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (5,2) moving DOWN. To eat the apple to the right (A at (5,3)), the snake should turn RIGHT. This allows it to consume the apple, increase the score, and grow. Continuing DOWN avoids apples and leads towards the wall.

Moving RIGHT would hit the wall. Valid options are UP or DOWN. Moving UP to (4,6) is safe and positions the snake to potentially reach apples in upper rows. Moving DOWN to (6,6) is also safe but leads closer to the bottom wall.

To eat the apples at (2,3) and (1,3), continuing UP allows reaching them in subsequent moves. Moving LEFT or RIGHT now doesn't lead to immediate apples and may limit future paths. Choosing UP aligns with maximizing apple consumption by accessing two apples first.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#  A   #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#  H   #\n#  S   #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#     A#\n########\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#  H   #\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n# A   A#\n########\n\nThe current direction is UP. Moving UP again would hit the wall, so the snake must turn LEFT or RIGHT. Moving RIGHT leads the head to (1,4), an empty space. From there, changing direction to DOWN allows the snake to navigate towards the apple at (5,4) in fewer steps compared to moving LEFT. Choosing RIGHT sets up a path to the nearest apple efficiently. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#  SH  #\n#  S   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n# A   A#\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT, and the snake can't reverse to LEFT. The head is at (1,3). Moving UP would hit the wall. Valid moves are RIGHT or DOWN. Moving DOWN to (2,3) is safe and starts the path towards the apples in the lower rows. Choosing RIGHT would move the head closer to the right wall but requires turning DOWN afterward. DOWN is the optimal choice to head directly toward the nearest apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#  SS  #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n# A   A#\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN. The head is at (2,4) based on the third row. Moving DOWN takes the head to (3,4), which is empty and safe. This direction leads towards the apple at (5,4). Turning LEFT or RIGHT doesn't immediately reach an apple and may lead into longer paths. The snake can't reverse to UP. Continuing DOWN is safe and optimal.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#   S  #\n#   S  #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n# A   A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN. The snake's head (H) is at (row3, column4) moving downward. To reach the nearest apple at (row5, column4), the snake should continue moving DOWN. Moving LEFT or RIGHT would divert the snake away from the closest apple. Continuing DOWN allows the snake to safely reach the apple in two moves, avoiding collisions. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#   S  #\n#   S  #\n#   H  #\n#   A  #\n# A   A#\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is DOWN. The head is at position (5,5), moving downward to (6,5) where there's an apple ('A'). Moving DOWN allows the snake to eat the apple, increase the score, and grow without causing a collision. Other directions (LEFT or RIGHT) don't lead to apples and might not be as beneficial. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#   SA #\n#   S  #\n#   S  #\n#   H  #\n# A   A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake's head is at (5,4) moving DOWN. To reach the nearest apple at (6,5), the optimal move is RIGHT. Moving RIGHT changes the direction to RIGHT, allowing the snake to then move DOWN to (6,5) and eat the apple in the next step. This path avoids collisions and positions the snake closer to the apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#   S  #\n#   S  #\n#   SH #\n# A   A#\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake's head (H) is at (5,5) and moving right. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. Moving DOWN allows the snake to eat the apple at (6,5), avoiding self-collision or walls. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#   S  #\n#   SS #\n# A  HA#\n########\n\nThe current direction is DOWN. The snake's head (H) is at position (6,5). Moving DOWN would hit the wall at (7,5), causing a game over. Therefore, the snake must change direction. Possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT. \n\nLooking at adjacent cells:\n- To the right (position (6,6)) is an apple (A). Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score and growing in length without colliding with the wall or its body.\n- To the left (position (6,4)) is empty. While safe, it doesn't provide an immediate score increase.\n\nChoosing RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple and continue the game. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#   S A#\n#   SS #\n# A  SH#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT. The snake's head is at (7,7) moving right towards the wall. To avoid collision, the snake must turn. Turning UP moves the head to (6,7), which is safe. Turning DOWN leads to a wall. The snake can't reverse to LEFT. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#   SSH#\n# A  SS#\n########\n\nThe snake's current head is at (5,6) moving UP. Moving UP leads to (4,6), which is safe. LEFT and RIGHT directions would result in collisions. The only valid direction is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","","","",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The snake's head is at (4,4) (row, column), with the body segment 'S' at (4,3). Directly to the right of the head (position (4,5)) is an apple ('A'). Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing its length and score. The other possible directions (UP or DOWN) avoid immediate collision but miss the opportunity to eat the apple. Since the current direction is RIGHT and reversing is not allowed, the optimal move is to continue RIGHT to consume the apple safely.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SSH #\n#    A #\n#    A #\n########\n\nTo determine the next direction, we analyze the current snake position and available apples. The snake's head (H) is at (4,5), moving RIGHT. Apples are at (1,3), (5,5), and (6,5). Moving DOWN changes the head's position to (5,5), directly eating the apple there. This increases the snake's length and avoids collision.

Moving DOWN would hit the wall. The valid options are LEFT or RIGHT. Moving RIGHT leads to an apple (A) at (6,6), allowing the snake to eat it and grow. LEFT moves to an empty space but doesn't provide any benefit.

Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving UP leads to (2,6), a safe space. Moving LEFT to (3,5) is also safe. RIGHT leads to the wall (3,7), causing collision. \n\nApples are at (1,3), (2,5), and (6,2). The nearest accessible apple is at (2,5). Moving UP now requires a subsequent LEFT to reach it. Moving LEFT now allows an immediate UP next step to eat the apple. Choosing LEFT avoids the wall proximity and positions the snake centrally for flexibility. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#    A #\n#    HS#\n#     S#\n#     S#\n# A  SS#\n########\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#    H #\n# A  SS#\n#     S#\n#     S#\n# A  SS#\n########\n\nThe current direction is UP. The snake's head is at row 2, column 5. Moving UP to row 1, column 5 is safe and positions the snake closer to the apple in row 1, column 3. Changing direction to LEFT or RIGHT would avoid immediate collisions but may not lead to the nearest apple as efficiently. Continuing UP allows the snake to approach the apple in row 1 with subsequent left moves. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#  A H #\n#    S #\n# A  SS#\n#     S#\n#     S#\n# A   S#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP. The snake's head (H) is at (1,5) and moving UP would collide with the wall at row 0. The valid directions are LEFT or RIGHT. Moving LEFT takes H to (1,4), an empty space, allowing the snake to avoid collision and approach the apple at (1,3) in the next move. Moving RIGHT leads to (1,6), which is safe but doesn't lead toward nearby apples. Choosing LEFT is optimal to reach the nearest apple quickly.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#  AHS #\n#    S #\n# A  SS#\n#     S#\n#     S#\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (1,4) moving left. The next possible directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. Moving UP leads to a wall collision. Moving LEFT allows the snake to eat the apple at (1,3) and continue left safely.

The possible moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving UP continues away from the apples. Turning LEFT allows the snake to move towards the apple at (5,3) by first going left, then down, then right. This path is shorter and leads to the closest apple. Choosing LEFT now sets up this optimal path. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# H    #\n#  A   #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# HA   #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN. The head is at position (5,2), with an apple ('A') directly to the right (5,3). The snake cannot reverse direction (UP is invalid), so valid moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. \n\nMoving DOWN to (6,2) avoids the apple but leads to a position where future moves can target the apples at (6,3) and (6,5). However, turning RIGHT immediately allows the snake to eat the apple at (5,3), increasing its length and score. After eating this apple, the snake can continue moving RIGHT toward other apples. Choosing RIGHT maximizes the immediate opportunity to eat an apple and extend the snake's length, which is critical for accessing more apples safely. Moving LEFT would lead toward the wall (column 1) with no immediate benefit. Continuing DOWN risks missing the adjacent apple and offers no immediate gain. Thus, RIGHT is the optimal choice. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n# SH   #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake's head is at (5,3), moving right. To reach the nearest apple at (6,3), changing direction to DOWN allows the head to move to (6,3), eat the apple, and grow. Since the current direction is RIGHT, turning DOWN is a valid direction (not a reversal). \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n# SS  A#\n#  H  A#\n########\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  S  A#\n#  SH A#\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake's head is at (6,4) moving right. The available directions are RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. Moving DOWN leads to a wall collision, so it's invalid. Choosing between RIGHT (toward the apple at (6,6)) or UP (toward the apple at (5,6)). Moving RIGHT allows the snake to reach the apple in the next move, making it the optimal choice to increase the score safely. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#  SSHA#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (6,5) moving RIGHT. The next cell to the right (6,6) contains an apple (A). Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score and growing longer. Other valid directions (UP or DOWN) avoid immediate collisions but don't consume an apple. Moving DOWN would hit the wall. Choosing RIGHT is optimal to eat the apple safely. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#  SSSH#\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving RIGHT, with its head at the end of the body (row 6, column 6). Moving RIGHT again would collide with the wall (#) at column 7. Turning DOWN leads to row 7, which is also a wall. Reversing to LEFT is invalid. The only safe option is UP, moving the head to row 5, column 6 (empty space), avoiding collision. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#    A #\n#   A  #\n#     H#\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is UP. Possible moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (since DOWN is a reversal and invalid). Moving RIGHT leads to a wall (#), so it's unsafe. Moving UP takes the head to (4,6), a safe space but no apple. Moving LEFT to (5,5) is also safe and positions the snake closer to the apple at (4,4). Choosing LEFT avoids immediate collision and strategically moves toward an apple. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#    A #\n#   A  #\n#    HS#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is LEFT. Possible moves are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. Moving DOWN would crash into the body at (6,5). Moving LEFT takes the head to (5,4), a safe space. Moving UP to (4,5) is also safe. Choosing UP positions the snake closer to the apple at (3,5) and allows subsequent moves to eat apples efficiently. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#    A #\n#   AH #\n#    SS#\n#    SS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at row 4, column 5, moving UP. The current direction allows moving UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving UP to (3,5) eats the apple ('A') there, increasing the score and growing the snake. This path is safe as it avoids walls and body segments. Changing direction to LEFT would also eat an apple at (4,4) but may limit future movement options. Continuing UP is the optimal choice to safely eat the apple and proceed towards remaining apples.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#      #\n#  AA  #\n#    H #\n#   AS #\n#    SS#\n#    SS#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP. The snake's head is at (3,5) moving upward. Possible moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving UP leads to (2,5), a safe space. From there, the next move LEFT can reach an apple at (2,4). Choosing UP positions the snake to access two apples in row 2 efficiently. Moving LEFT or RIGHT now doesn't eat an apple and may not optimize future paths. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#      #\n#  AAH #\n#    S #\n#   AS #\n#    SS#\n#     S#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nThe snake's head is at position (2,5) and moving UP. To eat the nearest apple at (2,4), turning LEFT is valid. This direction doesn't collide with walls or body parts. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#  AHS #\n#   AS #\n#   AS #\n#    SS#\n#     S#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT. The snake's head (H) is at position (2,4) moving left. Possible moves: LEFT, UP, or DOWN (can't reverse to RIGHT). \n\n- **LEFT (2,3)**: Contains an apple. Eating it grows the snake and increases score. Safe as the next position isn't a wall or body.  \n- **DOWN (3,4)**: Another apple. Eating it allows potential access to another apple at (4,4) but risks approaching the bottom wall.  \n- **UP (1,4)**: Empty cell, no apple.  \n\nChoosing LEFT eats the immediate apple and navigates toward open space on the left, avoiding tight corridors near walls. DOWN risks future collisions with walls due to limited maneuvering room. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","","",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#AA S  #\n#   S  #\n#   S  #\n#   S A#\n#   H  #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","action":"DOWN"}

The head is at (4,4). Possible moves are RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. Moving RIGHT leads to (4,5), empty. Moving UP to (3,4) or DOWN to (5,4), both empty. All options are safe. To reach apples efficiently, moving DOWN positions the snake closer to the two apples at (6,2) and (6,6). Choosing DOWN allows the snake to navigate towards these apples in subsequent moves. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   H  #\n# A   A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake's head is at (5,4) and moving DOWN. Moving DOWN to (6,4) positions it closer to the apples in row 6. From there, the snake can turn LEFT or RIGHT to reach the apples at (6,2) or (6,6) respectively. Continuing DOWN is the safest immediate move to avoid unnecessary direction changes and approach the apples.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A H A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at row 6, column 4. The current direction is DOWN, which would move the head into a wall (row 7). The snake must turn LEFT or RIGHT. Moving LEFT takes the head to (6,3), and RIGHT to (6,5). Both positions are empty. Choosing LEFT allows the snake to reach the apple at (6,2) in the next move, while RIGHT leads to the apple at (6,6). Both paths are valid, but moving LEFT positions the snake closer to the apple at (1,2) in subsequent moves, enabling a more efficient upward path. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# AH  A#\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT. The head (H) is at position (6,3) (row 6, column 3). Moving LEFT would take the head to (6,2), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score and grows the snake's length. The valid directions are LEFT (continue moving left) or UP (since DOWN would hit the wall). Choosing LEFT allows the snake to safely eat the apple without collision. Moving UP is also safe but misses the apple. The optimal play is to eat the apple by moving LEFT. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# HS  A#\n########\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n# H    #\n# S   A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP. The snake is moving UP. Possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT (can't reverse to DOWN). \n\n- **LEFT**: Moves head to column 2 (wall), causing collision. Invalid.\n- **UP**: Head moves to (5,3), empty. Safe but no apple. \n- **RIGHT**: Head moves to (6,4), empty. Safe but no apple. \n\nChoosing RIGHT positions the snake closer to the apple at (4,5) in future moves. Moving UP continues toward (2,3), but both paths require similar steps. RIGHT offers better positional flexibility. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n# SH   #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake's head is at (5,3) moving RIGHT. Possible moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. \n\n- Moving RIGHT to (5,4) doesn't reach an apple immediately. \n- Moving UP starts a longer path toward the apple at (3,5). \n- Moving DOWN to (6,3) allows the snake to reach the apple at (6,5) in two right moves. This is the shortest path to an apple without collision.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  S   #\n#  H  A#\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is DOWN, so it can't move UP. The next move can't be DOWN either because that would hit the wall. The head is at (6,3). Moving RIGHT leads towards the apple at (6,6) without immediate collision. Choosing LEFT moves away from all apples and offers no benefit. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SH A#\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake's head is at (6,4) moving right. The possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. Moving DOWN would hit the wall (row 7), so it's invalid. Choosing between UP and RIGHT. Moving RIGHT leads the head to (6,5), then next step to (6,6) to eat the apple. This is the shortest path to an apple. UP would take the snake away from nearby apples. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SHA#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (6,5) moving RIGHT. The next cell to the right (column 6, row 6) contains an apple ('A'). Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score and growing in length. Other directions: UP (to row 5, column 5) is safe but misses the apple. DOWN leads to a wall (row 7). LEFT is invalid (reverse direction). Choosing RIGHT is optimal for scoring and safe. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#   SSH#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at the rightmost position in row 6, moving RIGHT towards the wall. Moving RIGHT again would cause a collision. The current direction is RIGHT, so LEFT is not allowed (reverse). DOWN leads to the wall. The only safe direction is UP to row 5, column 6, which is empty. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#A    H#\n#    SS#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nAnswer: LEFT","","","","",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The snake's head is at (4,3), and the closest apple is at (2,3) which is two cells up. Moving UP now takes the head to (3,3), a safe position. Continuing UP in the next step allows the snake to reach the apple at (2,3). Choosing any other direction would delay reaching the nearest apple. Since reversing direction is not allowed, UP is the optimal choice here.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n# A    #\n#  A   #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe current direction is UP. The snake's head (H) is at row 3, column 3. Moving UP would take the head to row 2, column 3, which contains an apple (A). This is safe (no collision) and increases the score. Other directions (LEFT or RIGHT) move into empty spaces but do not eat apples immediately. Since the snake can continue moving UP (no reversal), this is the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#  H   #\n#  S   #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is UP. The available moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving LEFT allows the snake to reach the apple at (row 1, column 2) in the next step. Moving UP keeps the snake in a central position to choose between two apples. However, turning LEFT now positions the snake directly under the left apple, enabling it to eat the apple in the next move when moving UP. This is the quickest path to an apple without collision.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n# A  A #\n# HS   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (row 2, column 2) moving left. To eat the nearest apple at (row 1, column 2), moving UP is allowed (not a reversal) and leads to eating the apple, increasing the score. Moving LEFT or DOWN avoids apples and offers no immediate benefit. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# H  A #\n# SS  A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is UP. Since moving UP would hit the wall, the snake must turn LEFT or RIGHT. Moving RIGHT allows the head to move towards the apple in row 1, column 5, providing a path to increase the score. Moving LEFT leads away from nearby apples. Choosing RIGHT avoids immediate collision and positions the snake to reach an apple. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n# SH A #\n# S   A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving RIGHT. The valid moves are RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. Moving UP would hit the wall (row 0), which is a collision and ends the game. Moving DOWN to (2,3) is safe and allows the snake to approach the apple at (2,5) in subsequent moves. However, moving RIGHT to (1,4) positions the snake closer to the apple at (1,5), which can be eaten in the next move. Choosing RIGHT allows the snake to eat two apples consecutively (at (1,5) and (2,5)) by moving down after eating the first, maximizing the score without risking collision. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n# SSHA #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake's head (H) is in row 2, column 4 (0-based). Moving RIGHT leads to the apple (A) at column 5. This is safe and increases the score. Alternative directions UP (wall collision) or DOWN (safe, no apple) are less optimal. Choosing RIGHT allows eating the apple and extending the snake's length. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#ASSSH #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake's head is at (1,5) moving right. Possible directions are RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. Moving UP leads to a wall (row 0), which is invalid. Moving RIGHT to (1,6) is safe but requires a subsequent DOWN to reach the apple at (2,6). Moving DOWN to (2,5) allows the snake to turn RIGHT next and directly eat the apple at (2,6). Choosing DOWN now positions the snake closer to the apple and avoids the wall collision risk associated with moving further right. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#A SSS #\n#    HA#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe current direction is DOWN. The snake's head is at position (2,5) and there's an apple to its right at (2,6). Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score by 1 without causing an immediate collision. Other directions (LEFT or DOWN) don't lead to apples and are safe but less optimal. Since the snake can't reverse to UP, RIGHT is the best choice. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#A SSS #\n#    SH#\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse to LEFT. Moving RIGHT would hit the wall. The possible directions are UP or DOWN. Moving UP takes the head to (1,6), which is safe. Moving DOWN takes the head to (3,6), also safe. The closest apple is at (5,6). Moving DOWN allows the snake to approach this apple. Choosing DOWN is the optimal move to avoid collision and aim for the apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe snake's head (H) is currently at position (3,6), moving DOWN. The valid moves are DOWN or LEFT (RIGHT leads to a wall collision). Moving DOWN to (4,6) is safe and sets the snake to reach the apple at (5,6) in the next step. Choosing LEFT to (3,5) avoids immediate danger but doesn't lead directly to an apple. The optimal move is DOWN to pursue the nearby apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#A   S #\n#    SS#\n#     S#\n#     H#\n#     A#\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe current direction is DOWN. Moving DOWN will take the snake's head to (5,6), where there is an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score and allows the snake to grow. Other directions like LEFT avoid immediate collision but don't collect the apple, while RIGHT leads to a wall. Choosing DOWN is the optimal move to maximize points safely.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#A  AS #\n#    SS#\n#     S#\n#     S#\n#     H#\n# A    #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nAnswer: LEFT","","","","",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#A  A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#HSSSSS#\n# A    #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","action":"LEFT"}

The head is at (4,3), and the nearest apple is at (3,2). To reach it, the snake can either move UP then LEFT or LEFT then UP. Moving UP now allows the snake to position itself to eat the apple in the next move without risking a collision with its body when moving downward later. Choosing LEFT now could lead to a collision if the snake later moves down. Thus, continuing UP is the safest and most efficient choice. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# AH   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  AA  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (3,3). The current direction is UP. The apple (A) is directly to the left of the head at (3,2). Moving LEFT allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score and growing the body. Turning LEFT is allowed since it's not a reversal from UP. Moving UP or RIGHT would not eat the apple. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# HS A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  AA  #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is LEFT. The possible moves are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. Moving LEFT would take the head to (3,1), which is safe but positions the snake near the wall with limited future options. Moving UP shifts the snake away from the apples in row 6. Moving DOWN positions the snake closer to the apples at (6,3) and (6,4) without immediate collision. Choosing DOWN is optimal to approach the apples and avoid the risk of hitting the wall after another LEFT move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# S  A #\n# H    #\n#      #\n#  AA  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (2,4) moving DOWN. To reach the nearest apples at (3,6) and (4,6), turning RIGHT now positions the snake to move down towards these apples efficiently. Moving RIGHT to (3,4) avoids immediate collision and aligns the snake closer to the apples. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    A #\n# SH   #\n#      #\n#  AA  #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is RIGHT. The head is at (4,3), and the body is at (4,2). To reach the nearest apple in row 6, columns 3 or 4, the optimal move is to change direction to DOWN. This allows the snake to move towards the apples in row 6, which are two steps away. Moving DOWN now leads to (5,3), a safe position, followed by another DOWN to (6,3) where an apple is present. This path avoids collisions and efficiently captures the apple. Changing direction to UP or continuing RIGHT would not immediately target any apples and may delay eating opportunities. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#  S   #\n#  H   #\n#  AA  #\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#  S  A#\n#  S   #\n#  HA  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (6,3), moving DOWN. The next move DOWN would hit the wall at (7,3), causing a game over. The valid options are LEFT or RIGHT. \n\nMoving RIGHT to (6,4) leads to eating an 'A', increasing the score and growing the snake. This direction is allowed (DOWN to RIGHT isn't a reversal) and avoids collision. Moving LEFT to (6,2) is safe but doesn't eat an apple. Choosing RIGHT maximizes the score. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#     A#\n#      #\n#    A #\n#  S  A#\n#  S   #\n#  SH  #\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake's head is at (6,4) and moving right would take it to (6,5), which is an empty space. Moving UP to (5,4) is also safe. However, moving right allows the snake to continue towards the apple at (4,6) by turning up later. Since reversing direction is not allowed and both RIGHT and UP are valid, continuing RIGHT maintains momentum towards potential future apples. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#     A#\n#      #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#  S   #\n#  SSH #\n########\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#     A#\n#      #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#    H #\n#  SSS #\n########\n\nThe current direction is UP. The snake's head is at (5,5). Moving RIGHT would take the head to (5,6), which is safe and positions the snake to eat the apple at (4,6) in the next move by moving UP. This path avoids collisions and sets up the opportunity to eat another apple. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#     A#\n#      #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#    SH#\n#   SS #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (5,6) moving right. To avoid hitting the wall, the snake must turn. Moving UP to (4,6) eats an apple ('A'), increasing the score and growing the snake. Moving DOWN to (6,6) is safe but doesn't collect an apple. RIGHT leads to a wall collision. Choosing UP is optimal to gain points. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#     A#\n#      #\n#    A #\n#    AH#\n#    SS#\n#   SS #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP. The snake's head is at (4,6) moving UP. To eat the apple at (4,5), changing direction to LEFT is valid (not a reversal). Moving LEFT allows the snake to consume the apple, grow, and avoid collision. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#     A#\n#   A  #\n#    A #\n#    HS#\n#    SS#\n#   SS #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake's head is at (4,5) moving LEFT. Possible directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. Moving DOWN leads to collision with body at (5,5). Moving LEFT to (4,4) is safe but no apple. Moving UP to (3,5) eats an apple ('A') and grows the snake. Choosing UP is optimal to eat the apple and avoid collision.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#     A#\n#   A  #\n#    H #\n#  A SS#\n#    SS#\n#   SS #\n########\n\nAnswer: LEFT","","","",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The current direction is UP. The closest apple is at (3,4). To reach it, the snake can either move UP to (3,3) then RIGHT, or RIGHT to (4,4) then UP. Both paths require two moves. Choosing RIGHT now aligns the snake's column with the apple, allowing it to move UP next and eat the apple efficiently. Moving RIGHT is a valid direction (not reversing) and positions the snake for the optimal path. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT. The snake can move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (no reversing to LEFT). The nearest apple is at (3,4) directly above the head. Moving UP allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#A  H  #\n#   S  #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (3,4) moving UP. The apples are at (1,5), (3,1), and (5,4). Moving LEFT changes direction to the left, allowing the snake to start moving towards the apple at (3,1) in three steps. Moving UP or RIGHT doesn't immediately reach an apple but could lead to future paths. However, moving LEFT is the optimal first step to reach the closest apple while avoiding collisions. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#A HS  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is LEFT. Possible moves are LEFT, UP, or DOWN (no reversal). The nearest apple is two steps left (row 3, column 1). Moving LEFT now takes the head closer to this apple. Other directions don't lead to immediate apples and may require longer paths. Choosing LEFT avoids collision and progresses toward the nearest apple. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#AHS   #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (2,2) moving left towards (2,1), which contains an apple (A). Moving LEFT allows the snake to eat the apple, grow in length, and avoid immediate collision. Other directions (UP or DOWN) would move the head away from the apple without gaining points. Since the snake cannot reverse to RIGHT, LEFT is the optimal choice here. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#    A #\n# A    #\n#HSS   #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is LEFT. Moving LEFT would take the head into the wall, causing a collision. To avoid this, the snake must change direction. Choosing UP moves the head to (2,1), which is safe and positions it closer to the apple at (2,2). Moving DOWN to (4,1) is safe but doesn't lead towards an immediate apple. UP provides a path to the nearest apple in the next move. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#    A #\n#HA    #\n#SS    #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP. The snake's head (H) is at (row 2, column 1) moving upward. Available directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving LEFT would collide with the wall. Moving UP leads to an empty space but misses the nearby apple at (row 2, column 2). Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple at (row 2, column 2), growing its length without causing a collision. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#    A #\n#SHA   #\n#SS    #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is RIGHT. The head is at (2,2), and moving right into (3,2) will eat the apple, increasing the score. This move is safe as it doesn't collide with walls or the body. Other directions like UP avoid the apple, and DOWN causes a collision. Choosing RIGHT is optimal here.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#    A #\n#SSH A #\n#SS    #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake is moving right, and the next possible directions are RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. Moving right to (2,4) is safe and positions the head closer to the apple at (2,5). Choosing UP or DOWN leads away from nearby apples. The optimal choice is to continue RIGHT to reach the apple in the next move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#    A #\n#SSSHA #\n#S     #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#    A #\n#SSSSH #\n#S     #\n#      #\n# A A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#    H #\n#SSSSS #\n#S     #\n#      #\n# A A  #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving UP but cannot continue in that direction as it would hit the wall. The possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT (since reversing to DOWN is not allowed). Moving LEFT would take the head to (2,4), which is safe. Moving RIGHT to (2,6) is also safe. However, choosing RIGHT allows the snake to then turn DOWN in the next move towards the apples in lower rows without colliding with its body. Moving LEFT and then DOWN would risk collision with the body at (3,4). Therefore, the best choice is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#    SH#\n#SSSSS #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A A  #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (1,6) moving RIGHT.

The snake's head is at (4,5). The closest apple is at (5,6). Moving DOWN to (5,5) positions the snake to move RIGHT next and eat the apple.

The snake can move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. The nearest apple is at (5,6), directly to the right. Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score and length. Since RIGHT is a valid direction (not a reverse of DOWN), the optimal move is RIGHT. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n# A    #\n#A     #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#    SH#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (5,6) moving right towards the wall at (5,7). To avoid collision, the snake must turn. Possible directions are UP or DOWN. Moving UP leads closer to apples in rows 1-3, while DOWN moves away. Choosing UP allows navigation towards the apple at (3,4). \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n# A    #\n#A     #\n#   A  #\n#     H#\n#     S#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is UP. The head is at (4,6), and moving UP would take it to (3,6), which is empty. Moving LEFT would take it to (4,5), also empty. Moving RIGHT would hit the wall. To reach the nearest apple at (3,4), the optimal path requires turning LEFT now to start moving towards the apple's column. Choosing LEFT now avoids the wall and begins the approach towards the apple, allowing the snake to eat it in subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n# A    #\n#A     #\n#   A  #\n#    HS#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (4,5), moving left. The closest apple is at (3,4). To reach it, the snake can move UP to (3,5) and then left to (3,4), eating the apple. Moving UP now starts the path toward the apple. Changing direction to UP is allowed (current direction is LEFT), and this avoids moving further left away from the apple. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n# A    #\n#A     #\n#   AH #\n#    S #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (3,5) moving UP. The adjacent left cell (3,4) is an apple ('A'). Turning LEFT is allowed (since current direction is UP, and LEFT is not a reverse). Moving left allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score and length. Other directions either miss apples or risk future collisions. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n# A A  #\n#A     #\n#   HS #\n#    S #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT. Possible moves: LEFT, UP, DOWN. Moving UP leads towards an apple at (4,1) in two steps. Moving LEFT or DOWN doesn't reach apples immediately. Choose UP to aim for the apple. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n# A A  #\n#A  H  #\n#   SS #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake's head is at (row 2, column 4), moving UP. Moving UP leads to (row 1, column 4), which contains an apple ('A'). This allows the snake to eat the apple, grow longer, and increase the score. This move is safe as it doesn't collide with walls or the snake's body. Other directions (LEFT or RIGHT) would not eat an apple and are less optimal. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n# A H A#\n#A  S  #\n#   SS #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (1,3) moving UP. Moving UP would hit the wall (row 0), causing a game over. The snake can't reverse direction to DOWN. Valid options are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP (but UP leads to collision). \n\nMoving LEFT to (1,2) eats an apple ('A'), growing the snake. The new head position is safe with no collision. Moving RIGHT to (1,4) is safe but no apple. Choosing LEFT maximizes score without collision.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe snake's head (H) is currently at position (1,3) moving LEFT. The next position to the left (1,2) contains an apple (A), which the snake can eat to grow. Moving UP would collide with the wall (#), and moving DOWN would go to an empty space (2,3) but miss the apple. Therefore, continuing LEFT is the optimal choice to eat the apple and avoid collisions. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n# HSS A#\n#A  S  #\n#   S  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe current direction is LEFT. The snake can move LEFT, UP, or DOWN (can't reverse to RIGHT). Moving UP would hit the wall (row 0 is all walls). Moving LEFT to (1,1) is safe but doesn't eat an apple. Moving DOWN to (2,2) is safe and allows the snake to approach the apple at (2,1) in the next move. Choosing DOWN positions the snake to eat the apple in the subsequent step, increasing the score. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","","","","",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The available directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving UP leads toward the top wall with no apples, limiting future options. Apples are located at (5,1), (6,3), and (6,5). Turning RIGHT allows the snake to head toward the apples at (6,5) and (6,3). Moving RIGHT to (2,5) is safe, and subsequent moves can proceed DOWN to reach the apples without collisions. Choosing RIGHT starts a path toward the denser cluster of apples on the right side, providing more opportunities to score. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#   SH #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (2,5), moving right. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. Moving right takes the head to (2,6), an empty space. However, this path leads toward the wall and away from the apples. \n\nThe apples are at (5,1), (6,3), and (6,5). The nearest accessible apple is at (6,5), directly below the head. Choosing DOWN moves the head to (3,5), aligning it with the column of the apple at (6,5). This path avoids walls and self-collision, allowing the snake to reach the apple efficiently. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#    S #\n#    H #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN. The snake's head is at (3,5) moving downward. Moving DOWN takes it to (4,5), which is safe. Continuing in this direction allows the snake to reach the apple at (6,5) in three moves.

To avoid collision and aim for the closest apple (at row 6, column 4), turning LEFT allows the snake to start moving toward the left side where apples are located. Moving LEFT from the current head position (4,5) to (4,4) is safe and aligns with the path to reach the apples efficiently without immediate collision risks.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   HS #\n#A     #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nThe current direction is LEFT. The snake's head is at (4,4) moving left. To reach the nearest apple at (6,4), changing direction to DOWN allows the snake to move towards it. Moving down to (5,4) is safe and sets up the next move to go down again to eat the apple. Other directions don't lead towards apples as efficiently. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   S  #\n#A  H  #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (5,4) moving DOWN. The apples are at (5,1), (6,3), and (6,5). Moving DOWN to (6,4) does not eat an apple but positions the snake adjacent to two apples in the next step. This allows flexibility to choose LEFT or RIGHT next to reach an apple, maximizing future opportunities. Turning LEFT or RIGHT now would target one apple but limit immediate options. Continuing DOWN is optimal for maintaining maneuverability. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A  S  #\n#  AHA #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN.

The valid moves are LEFT, UP, or DOWN (but DOWN leads to a wall). The snake's head is at (6,3). Moving UP to (5,3) is safe and positions the snake to reach the apple at (5,1) in subsequent moves. Moving LEFT is safe but doesn't lead towards any apples. The optimal choice is UP to approach the nearest apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A H   #\n#  SSAA#\n########\n\nThe current direction is UP. The snake's head (H) is at row 5, column 3. Apples are located at (5,1), (6,5), and (6,6). Possible moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving LEFT allows the snake to reach the closest apple at (5,1) in two steps (LEFT then LEFT). This path avoids collisions and positions the snake to eat an apple quickly. Moving UP or RIGHT delays apple consumption. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#AHS   #\n#  S AA#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (5,2) moving LEFT.

The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#H     #\n#S     #\n#SA    #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#    AA#\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","action":"UP"}

The current direction is UP. Possible moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving UP leads to row 3, column 3, which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score and grows the snake. Moving LEFT or RIGHT does not reach an apple immediately.

The snake's head is at position (3,3). To avoid collision and aim for the nearest apple at (2,2), the snake should turn LEFT. Moving LEFT positions the head at (3,2), allowing the next move UP to (2,2) to eat the apple. This path avoids walls and self-collision while targeting the closest apple efficiently.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#      #\n# A    #\n# HS   #\n#    A #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#    A #\n# H    #\n# SS   #\n#    A #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is UP. The possible moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. The apples are at (1,5), (4,5), and (5,3). Moving UP to (1,2) doesn't eat an apple but positions the snake toward the apple at (1,5). Moving LEFT to (2,1) doesn't eat an apple and leads away from all apples. Moving RIGHT to (2,3) also doesn't eat an apple but sets a path toward the apple at (5,3). Choosing RIGHT allows the snake to turn DOWN next and reach (5,3) in three moves, making it the best option.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#    A #\n# SH   #\n# S    #\n#    A #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#    A #\n# SS   #\n#  H   #\n#    A #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#    A #\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n#  H A #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe current direction is DOWN. The snake's head is at row 4, column 3. Moving DOWN will take it to row 5, column 3, which contains an apple ('A'). This is safe and allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score and length. Changing direction to LEFT or RIGHT would not immediately lead to an apple and might reduce efficiency. Since moving DOWN does not cause a collision and results in eating an apple, the best choice is to continue moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#A   A #\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n#  S A #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is DOWN. The head is at (5,3). Moving DOWN to (6,3) doesn't eat an apple. To reach the nearest apple at (4,5), the snake should turn RIGHT. This allows the head to move towards the apple in subsequent moves. Turning RIGHT now changes direction to RIGHT, moving the head to (5,4). From there, moving UP and then RIGHT would safely reach the apple. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#A   A #\n#      #\n#  S   #\n#  S A #\n#  SH  #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake's head is at (5,4) moving right. Possible directions are RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. Moving UP to (4,4) leads to an apple ('A'), allowing the snake to eat it and grow. This move is safe as (4,4) isn't adjacent to any walls or body parts. RIGHT continues safely but without eating an apple, and DOWN also avoids collision but misses the apple. Choosing UP maximizes the score. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#A   A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SHA #\n#  SS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nPossible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving LEFT would cause the snake to collide with its body at (4,3). Moving UP keeps the snake safe but doesn't eat an apple. Moving RIGHT allows the snake's head to move to (4,5) where there's an apple ('A'), increasing the score by 1 and growing the snake. This move is safe as it doesn't collide with walls or the body. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#AA  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SSH #\n#  SS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT. Possible moves: RIGHT, UP, DOWN. Moving RIGHT to (4,6) is safe but leads towards the wall. Moving UP to (3,5) starts ascending towards the apples in row 1. Moving DOWN to (5,5) moves away from apples. UP offers a path to reach an apple in future moves. Choose UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#AA  A #\n#      #\n#    H #\n#   SS #\n#  SS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP. The snake is moving upwards. Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving UP leads the head to row 2, column 5, which is safe. This positions the snake to reach the apple at row 1, column 5 in the next move. Choosing LEFT or RIGHT would divert the snake away from the closest apple and might lead into walls or require longer paths. The optimal move is to continue UP to approach the nearest apple efficiently.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#AA  A #\n#    H #\n#    S #\n#   SS #\n#   S  #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP. The snake's head is at position (2,5). Moving UP to (1,5) will eat the apple 'A' there. This is safe as it doesn't collide with walls or the body. The snake can continue in the same direction. Reversing direction (DOWN) is invalid. LEFT or RIGHT avoid the apple but don't increase the score. Optimal choice is UP to eat the apple. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#AA  H #\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#   SS #\n#   S A#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP.

The closest apple is at (2,3). Moving DOWN allows the snake to reach the apple in two moves (DOWN then LEFT), avoiding collision and reversing direction. Moving RIGHT leads away from the apple and towards the wall. UP would hit the wall. Thus, the optimal move is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n# SSS  #\n#  AH  #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (2,4) moving DOWN. To eat the nearby apple (A) at (2,3), the snake must turn LEFT. This direction is valid (not a reversal) and leads to consuming the apple, increasing the score, and growing the snake.

The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#     A#\n# S    #\n# S    #\n# SSSSH#\n#   A  #\n#     A#\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","action":"RIGHT"}

The current direction is UP, so turning left is allowed. Moving left now positions the snake closer to the apple. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n# H    #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at row 4, column 2. The current direction is LEFT, so the valid next directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. The nearest apple is at row 5, column 1. Moving DOWN to (5,2) positions the snake to reach the apple in the next move by turning LEFT. This avoids immediate collision and efficiently targets the closest apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#AH    #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (5,2) moving DOWN. To eat the nearest apple at (5,1), the snake must turn LEFT. Moving LEFT is valid (no collision) and immediately consumes the apple, increasing the score. Although this leads to a wall collision in the next move, it maximizes the current score. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#A     #\n#    AA#\n#      #\n#      #\n#HS    #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe current direction is LEFT. The snake's head is at (5,1), moving left. Moving left would hit the wall, so the valid options are UP or DOWN. Moving up to (4,1) is safe and allows future movement towards apples. Moving down to (6,1) is safe but leads away from apples. Choosing UP is better for reaching apples. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#    AA#\n#      #\n#H     #\n#S     #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake is moving UP. The valid directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving LEFT would collide with the wall. Moving RIGHT is safe but doesn't immediately reach an apple. Moving UP continues toward the nearest apple at (1,1) safely. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#A     #\n#    AA#\n#H     #\n#S     #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving UP. The head is at position (3,1) and cannot reverse direction to DOWN. The available directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving LEFT would immediately collide with the wall. Moving RIGHT leads to (3,2), which is safe but farther from the nearest apple. Continuing UP to (2,1) positions the head closer to the apple at (1,1), allowing it to eat the apple in the next move. This path avoids collisions and efficiently targets the nearest apple. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#A     #\n#H   AA#\n#S     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is UP. The head is at (2,1), moving upwards. Moving UP into row 1, column 1 (which is an apple 'A') allows the snake to eat it, increasing the score and growing in length. Alternative directions like LEFT would collide with the wall, and RIGHT moves into an empty space with no apple. Choosing UP is safe and beneficial. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#H     #\n#S   AA#\n#S     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP. The snake is moving UP, which would take it into the wall (row 0). The player must change direction to avoid collision. Possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT (can't reverse to DOWN). Moving LEFT from (1,1) leads to a wall (column 0). Moving RIGHT to (1,2) is safe. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#SH    #\n#S   AA#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving RIGHT. The apples are in row 2 (positions 5 and 6) and row 6 (position 4). Moving DOWN allows the snake to enter row 2, positioning it closer to the apples there. Choosing RIGHT keeps the snake in a row with no apples. Since DOWN is a valid direction (not a reversal) and avoids collision, it's the optimal choice to reach the nearest apples.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#SS    #\n# H  AA#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at (2,2) moving DOWN. Possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving RIGHT positions the snake towards the nearest apples (A) at (2,5) and (2,6), which is the optimal path to eat an apple and grow. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n# S    #\n# SH AA#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake can move RIGHT, UP, or DOWN (can't reverse to LEFT). The apples are at (2,5), (2,6), and (6,4). Moving RIGHT positions the snake closer to two apples. Choosing RIGHT allows the snake to proceed toward the nearest apples safely without collision. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n# SSHAA#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n# SSSHA#\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (5,2) moving right. To the right is an apple. Moving right allows eating the apple, increasing the score, and safely extending the snake's body. Other directions (up or down) avoid immediate collision but miss the apple. Since reversing direction is not allowed, RIGHT is the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n# SSSSH#\n#  A A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at the end of the SSSSH sequence in the third row, moving RIGHT towards the wall. Since the current direction is RIGHT, moving further right would collide with the wall (game over). The valid directions are UP or DOWN (can't reverse to LEFT). Moving DOWN leads the head to row 3, column 5, which contains an apple ('A'), allowing the snake to eat it, grow, and avoid collision. Moving UP avoids the wall but misses the apple. Choosing DOWN is optimal to eat the apple and increase the score.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","","","",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Possible moves are RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. Moving RIGHT leads to (4,6), which is safe but doesn't eat an apple. Moving UP to (3,5) or DOWN to (5,5) are also safe. Considering future paths, moving UP positions the snake closer to two apples (A1 and A2), offering a strategic advantage. Moving DOWN increases distance from all apples. Thus, the optimal choice is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#     A#\n#  A   #\n#   H  #\n#A  S  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is UP. The head (H) is at position (3,4). Apples are located at (1,5), (2,3), and (4,1). The closest apple is at (2,3). To reach it, the snake can either move UP then LEFT or LEFT then UP. Moving LEFT immediately changes the direction to LEFT, allowing the next move to be UP directly into the apple's position (2,3). This path avoids potential conflicts and positions the snake to eat the apple efficiently. Moving UP first would also work but requires an additional LEFT turn afterward. Choosing LEFT now provides a direct route toward the nearest apple. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#     A#\n#  A   #\n#  HS  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is LEFT. Possible moves are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. Moving UP allows the snake to eat the apple at (3,4), growing in length and increasing the score. Moving LEFT or DOWN leads to empty spaces with no apples. Choosing UP is the optimal move here. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#     A#\n#A H   #\n#  SS  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#     A#\n#AHS   #\n#  S   #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe current direction is LEFT. The snake's head (H) is at (2,2). Moving LEFT would take the head to (2,1), where there's an apple ('A'), allowing the snake to eat it, grow, and increase the score. Checking for collisions: (2,1) is not a wall or part of the snake's body. Other directions (UP or DOWN) lead to empty spaces but don't eat apples. Since LEFT is safe and beneficial, the best move is LEFT. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#     A#\n#HSS   #\n#  S   #\n#A     #\n#      #\n# A    #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction to RIGHT. Moving LEFT would lead the head into the wall at (2,0), causing a collision. Therefore, the snake must choose between UP or DOWN. \n\nMoving UP to (1,1) is safe but doesn't lead to an apple. Moving DOWN to (3,1) positions the snake closer to the apple at (4,1), allowing it to eat the apple in the next move. This is the optimal path to avoid collision and increase the score. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#     A#\n#SSS   #\n#H     #\n#A     #\n#      #\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe current direction is DOWN. The snake's head (H) is at position (3,1) moving downward. Moving DOWN will take the head to (4,1), where there's an apple (A). Eating the apple increases the score and grows the snake. Turning LEFT would hit the wall (game over), and RIGHT would move into an empty space but miss the apple. Choosing DOWN is safe and beneficial.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#   A A#\n#SSS   #\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#      #\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe current direction is DOWN. The snake's head is at position (4,1). Moving LEFT would hit the wall (#). Moving RIGHT to (4,2) is safe and positions the snake closer to the apple at (6,2). Moving DOWN to (5,1) is also safe but doesn't align as directly with the apple's column. Choosing RIGHT allows the snake to start moving toward the apple more efficiently without collisions. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#   A A#\n#SS    #\n#S     #\n#SH    #\n#      #\n# A    #\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#   A A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#SS    #\n# H    #\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (5,2) moving DOWN. To eat the apple at (6,2), moving DOWN is valid and doesn't cause a collision. Choosing LEFT or RIGHT avoids the apple.

The head is at (6,2). To avoid collision, the snake must change direction. The apple at (6,3) is adjacent to the head. Choosing RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple, grow longer, and survive. Turning RIGHT is valid (not a reversal of DOWN). \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#   A A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#SS A  #\n# S    #\n# SH   #\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT.

The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#  HA A#\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n#  SA  #\n#  S   #\n# SS   #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","action":"UP"}

The snake's head is at (3,3). Moving UP takes the head to (2,3), which is safe. Continuing UP in the next step leads to (1,3) where there's an apple. Choosing UP now is the best path to eat the apple quickly without collision.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe snake's head is currently at position (2,3) moving UP. Moving UP will take it to (1,3) where there's an apple ('A'), allowing the snake to eat it, grow, and increase the score. This move is safe as there are no walls or body parts in that position. Other directions (LEFT or RIGHT) don't lead to immediate apple consumption. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#A H   #\n#  S  A#\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (1,3), and the current direction is UP. Moving UP would hit the wall (row 0 is all walls), so the valid directions are LEFT or RIGHT. \n\nChoosing LEFT moves the head to (1,2), a safe space. This positions the snake closer to the apple at (1,1), which can be eaten in the next move. Moving RIGHT to (1,4) leads away from immediate apples. Thus, LEFT is the optimal choice to eat an apple quickly and avoid collision.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#AHS   #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT, and the head is at position (1,2). Moving LEFT again will take the head to (1,1), where there is an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score and the snake's length. The next valid directions after this move will need to avoid the wall at (1,0), but the immediate priority is to consume the apple. Reversing direction (RIGHT) is invalid, so the best choice is to continue moving LEFT. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#HSS  A#\n#     A#\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is LEFT. Moving LEFT would cause the head to hit the wall. Moving UP would also result in a wall collision. The only safe direction is DOWN, which moves the head to an empty space without collision. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#SS   A#\n#H    A#\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is DOWN. Moving DOWN to (3,1) is safe as there's no wall or body there. This sets up the next move to (4,1) where an apple 'A' is present. Eating that apple increases the score and length. Choosing LEFT would hit the wall (column 0), and RIGHT doesn't immediately lead to an apple. The optimal choice is to continue DOWN. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#S    A#\n#S    A#\n#H     #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (3,1) moving DOWN. The available directions are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving LEFT would hit the wall. Moving RIGHT leads to an empty space. Moving DOWN allows the snake to eat the apple at (4,1), increasing the score and length. Choosing DOWN is optimal to maximize the score and safely grow the snake. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#S    A#\n#S  A A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4,1), moving downward. Possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. LEFT leads to a wall (#), so it's invalid. Moving DOWN to (5,1) is safe but doesn't reach an apple. Moving RIGHT to (4,2) allows the snake to navigate toward the apples in row 2 (columns 4 and 6). Although no apple is immediately eaten, turning RIGHT positions the snake to approach the apples in subsequent moves, making it the optimal choice. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#     A#\n#S  A A#\n#S     #\n#SH    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#     A#\n#   A A#\n#SH    #\n#SS    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe current direction is UP. The snake's head is at (3,2). Moving UP would take the head to (2,2), which is empty. Moving LEFT to (3,1) causes a collision with the body. Moving RIGHT to (3,3) is safe. Choosing RIGHT positions the snake to approach the apples in row 2. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#     A#\n#   A A#\n# SH   #\n#SS    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake's head is at (3,3) moving RIGHT. To reach the nearest apple at (2,4), changing direction to UP allows the snake to move towards the apple in subsequent steps. Moving UP now positions the head at (2,3), then turning RIGHT to (2,4) eats the apple. This path avoids collisions and efficiently targets the closest apple. Choosing UP now is valid since it's not a reverse direction from RIGHT. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#     A#\n#  HA A#\n# SS   #\n# S    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is UP. The head (H) is at position (2,3). Moving RIGHT would take it to (2,4) where there's an apple ('A'), allowing the snake to eat it and grow. Moving UP leads to an empty space with no apple, and moving LEFT causes a collision with the body. Thus, the best move is RIGHT. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#     A#\n#  SH A#\n# SSA  #\n# S    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (2,4) moving RIGHT. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. Moving DOWN to (3,4) leads to an apple 'A', allowing the snake to eat it, increase the score, and grow without collision. Other directions move into empty spaces but miss immediate apples. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","","","",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#  S   #\n# AS   #\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n#A S   #\n#  H  A#\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","action":"DOWN"}

The closest apple is at (5,4) directly below. Changing direction to DOWN is allowed (not a reversal) and leads the head into the apple. This safely increases the score and grows the snake. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#  SS  #\n#   H  #\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is DOWN. To reach the closest apple at (6,1), the best immediate move is LEFT. Moving left positions the head at (5,3), allowing subsequent moves down and left towards the apple. This avoids collision and initiates the path to the nearest apple efficiently.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#   S  #\n#  HS  #\n#A     #\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SS  #\n#A H   #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake's head is at (6,4) and moving DOWN would hit the wall. Possible moves are LEFT or RIGHT. Moving LEFT to (6,3) is safe and positions the snake closer to the apple at (6,1). Moving RIGHT to (6,5) is also safe but leads away from immediate apples. Choosing LEFT allows the snake to approach the nearest apple efficiently. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#  S   #\n#AHS   #\n########\n\nThe current direction is LEFT. The snake's head (H) is at position (6,2). Moving LEFT would take the head to (6,1), where there's an apple (A). Eating it increases the score and grows the snake. Since moving LEFT is allowed (not a reversal) and the next position is safe (no collision with walls or body), this is the optimal move. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#A    A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#  S   #\n#HSS   #\n########\n\nThe current direction is LEFT. The snake's head is at position (6,1), moving left towards the wall. The next move cannot continue left (collision) or reverse to right. Moving down leads to a wall. The only valid direction is UP to (5,1), which is safe. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#A    A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#H     #\n#SSS   #\n########\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#A    A#\n#      #\n#H     #\n#S     #\n#SS    #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (4,1) moving UP. Moving UP to (3,1) is safe. Turning LEFT would hit the wall. Turning RIGHT doesn't lead to an apple immediately. Continuing UP allows the snake to approach the nearest apple at (2,1) in the next move. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#A    A#\n#H     #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is UP. Moving UP will take the head to row 2, column 1 where there's an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the snake's length and score. Other directions like LEFT would collide with the wall, and RIGHT moves away from the nearest apple. Thus, UP is the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#H    A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#S    A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP. The snake's head is at (2,1). Moving UP to (1,1) is safe. Turning RIGHT would go to (2,2), also safe. LEFT leads to a wall. Between UP and RIGHT, moving UP allows the snake to reach the apple in row 1 (two steps) faster than moving RIGHT towards the apple in row 2 (three steps). Continuing UP is valid and sets a path to an apple more efficiently. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#H A   #\n#S    A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP. The snake is at the top edge moving upward, which would hit the wall. To avoid collision, the snake must turn. It can't reverse to DOWN. Moving LEFT would hit the left wall. Only valid direction is RIGHT to move towards the empty cell and the nearby apple. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#SHA   #\n#S    A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake's head is at position (1,2) in row 1, column 2. Moving RIGHT leads to (1,3), which is an apple ('A'), allowing the snake to eat it, increase the score, and grow. Moving UP would collide with the wall (row 0), and moving DOWN is safe but doesn't eat an apple. Since the goal is to maximize apples eaten, moving RIGHT is optimal. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#SSH   #\n#S    A#\n#S     #\n#SA    #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake is currently moving RIGHT. The valid moves are RIGHT (continue), DOWN, or UP (invalid due to wall). Moving RIGHT would take the head to (1,4), a safe empty space. Moving DOWN to (2,3) is also safe. Choosing DOWN allows the snake to start navigating towards the apple at (2,6) or others in the south. Since DOWN is a valid turn and avoids potential future collisions by exploring new areas, it's the optimal choice. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","","","","",""],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The goal of the game is to control the snake, eat as many apples as possible, and grow the snake in length. Each time the snake eats an apple, the score increases by one. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point.
