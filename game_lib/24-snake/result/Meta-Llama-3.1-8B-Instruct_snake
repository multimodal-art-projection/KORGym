Since there is no obstacle in the DOWN direction, we can safely change the direction to 'DOWN'. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","To move the snake forward, it needs to eat an apple or there's no apple in the current direction, it should turn to the next direction you give. In this case, since there are apples in both UP and DOWN directions, it should move UP to eat the apple. However, if we choose DOWN, it will collide with the wall. So, the best direction is to eat an apple in the DOWN direction and turn to DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","The snake is currently facing up and there are no apples in front of it. To move forward, we need to choose a new direction that allows it to potentially eat an apple. Since there are two apples on the left, we can choose to move left and see if it eats one.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","To eat the apples and avoid the walls, I will turn RIGHT. The snake is currently facing UP and there are apples to its right, so turning RIGHT will allow it to eat an apple and increase its length.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","To eat the apple above, I will move the snake down and then right. First, I will move down to eat the upper apple, then I will move right to eat the lower apple.\n\n########\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#  S A #\n#  AH  #\n#      #\n########\n\nNow, I will move down again to eat the apple.\n\n########\n#      #\n#   A #\n#  SAH #\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Based on the current situation, the snake's head is at the position of 'H' and it is facing 'UP'. Since there are no obstacles or apples directly above the head, the snake can move up. Eating the top apple will increase the score by one and the snake will grow in length.\n\nThe snake can eat the top apple, so the new board will be \n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#  H A #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the snake will grow and the current direction will still be 'UP'.\n\nHowever, since we are asked to choose a direction, according to the problem, we can move 'UP' or turn to 'LEFT', 'RIGHT' as the snake cannot reverse direction and there is no apple 'A' to eat on 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT' side. \n\nIf we move 'UP', the new board will be \n\n########\n#      #\n# A    #\n#  A   #\n#  H A #\n#      #\n########\n\nIf we turn to 'LEFT', the new board will be\n\n########\n#      #\n#    A#\n#  H A #\n#      #\n########\n\nIf we turn to 'RIGHT', the new board will be\n\n########\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#  A H #\n#      #\n########\n\nConsidering the snake cannot reverse direction and we should eat an apple. The optimal answer would be to move in the direction that we keep moving UP and eat an 'A'\n\nAnswer: UP","Based on the given game board and rules, the snake is currently moving up and the head is at position (2, 2). There are no walls in the way to move up, so the snake can continue moving up. \n\nThe board is empty to the left and right, but there are walls at the bottom, so moving down or left would result in a collision with the walls. \n\nConsidering these options, the snake can move up or right.\n\nHowever, moving right seems like a better option since it could potentially lead to more apples in the future.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","After analyzing the game board and the given rules, the snake is already eating an apple and its current direction is up. To avoid the game ending with the snake colliding with itself or the walls, it should move in the direction it is facing up and eat the apple. \n\nAnswer: UP","Answer: DOWN","The snake is currently moving up, so it will continue moving up in the next step. There is no wall or itself, so it will move up one square. \n\nAnswer: UP","To eat the apple and increase the score, the snake needs to move down to collide with the apple. \n\nAnswer: DOWN"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format. The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER' (without quotes), where YOUR_ANSWER is your final answer to the question,e.g.'Answer: LEFT'\n\nYou are controlling a snake in a Snake game.The board size is 8x8.In the game board. The goal of the game is to control the snake, eat as many apples as possible, and grow the snake in length. Each time the snake eats an apple, the score increases by one. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point. The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#      #\n# A    #\n#  A   #\n#  H A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\n","action":"DOWN"}
