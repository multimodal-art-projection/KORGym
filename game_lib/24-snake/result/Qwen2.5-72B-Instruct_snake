If we move UP, the snake will collide with itself. Moving RIGHT or LEFT will not lead to an immediate collision with a wall or itself, but it would not be optimal as it would not lead to an apple.

If we continue moving 'UP', the snake will move into the wall, which would end the game. Therefore, we need to choose a direction that will allow the snake to continue moving without hitting the wall or itself. The options are 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT'.\n\nChoosing 'LEFT' would move the snake to the left, where it can potentially eat an apple. Choosing 'RIGHT' would move the snake to the right, which is also safe but does not immediately lead to an apple.\n\nTo maximize the score, we should choose 'LEFT'.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#A A   #\n#     A#\n#      #\n# H    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#A A   #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#H     #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nBased on the current game board and the direction the snake is moving, the snake's head is at the position (4,1) and is moving to the left. Moving left will cause the snake to collide with the wall, ending the game. To avoid this, the snake should change its direction to either 'UP' or 'DOWN'. Given the positions of the apples, moving 'UP' will not immediately result in eating an apple, but it will move the snake towards the top-left apple. Moving 'DOWN' will also not result in eating an apple immediately but will move the snake towards the bottom part of the board, where there are no immediate obstacles.\n\nSince the goal is to maximize the score and avoid immediate collisions, the best move is to move 'UP' to approach the top apples more directly.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#A A   #\n#     A#\n#H     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nGiven the current state of the game, moving 'UP' will cause the snake to collide with the wall.

However, moving 'UP' will cause the snake to collide with the wall, which ends the game. To avoid this, we need to change the direction to either 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT'. \n\nChoosing 'LEFT' will move the snake's head to the left, and it will not collide with any walls or itself. \n\nChoosing 'RIGHT' will move the snake's head to the right, and it will not collide with any walls or itself either.\n\nTo maximize the chances of eating an apple, we should choose the direction that leads the snake closer to an apple. Moving 'LEFT' will not immediately lead to an apple, but moving 'RIGHT' will position the snake closer to the apple located at the top of the board.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to go 'RIGHT'.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#  AA  #\n#   HA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nGiven the current direction is RIGHT, the snake's head will move to the right.

This move will cause the snake to collide with itself, ending the game. Therefore, the best move is to avoid this collision.\n\nThe possible safe moves are:\n- UP: The snake moves to (2, 3), which is a safe move and avoids collision.\n- DOWN: The snake moves to (4, 3), which is also a safe move and avoids collision.\n\nSince the goal is to maximize the score, moving UP will not result in eating an apple, but moving DOWN will result in the snake eating an apple and increasing the score by 1.\n\nThus, the best move is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Sure, let's start by repeating the current game board:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n# A    #\n#  S A #\n#  H A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation and determine the best move.\n\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN.

If it continues in this direction, it will not collide with itself, the walls, or eat an apple. However, to maximize the score, we need to consider if a change in direction would lead to an apple. Looking at the board, turning LEFT would not be beneficial as the snake would just move into an empty space. Turning RIGHT would also not be beneficial for the same reason. Moving UP would result in a collision with the body of the snake, which is not allowed.\n\nThe best move is to continue moving DOWN, as it avoids immediate danger and allows for future moves that could lead to eating an apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The best move would be to continue moving 'UP' to get closer to the apples without risking a collision.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nGiven the current direction is UP, the snake is moving upwards. If we continue in this direction, the snake will move into an empty space, not an apple. To maximize the score, it's better to move towards an apple. The best move here would be to direct the snake to the LEFT to eat the apple in the same row. This will increase the score and grow the snake.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n# H    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nGiven the current direction is LEFT, and the snake is moving towards the left, the next move should be to continue moving LEFT. Moving in any other direction would lead to an unfavorable position, such as moving towards the wall or away from the apples. Therefore, the best move is to continue moving LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#H     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nGiven the current direction is LEFT, the snake will move to the left. However, moving left will cause the snake to collide with the wall, which ends the game. To avoid this, we need to change the direction to either UP or DOWN. Considering the positions of the apples, moving DOWN is a better choice as it will allow the snake to potentially reach the apples in the lower part of the board.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#H     #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nGiven the current board and direction, moving DOWN will lead the snake to an empty cell, so the snake will move down one cell but will not eat an apple. The next state of the board will be:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#H     #\n#  A   #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nSince the snake is currently moving DOWN and there is an apple directly below it, the best move is to continue moving DOWN to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#H     #\n#  A   #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nGiven the current direction and the game board, moving DOWN will cause the snake's head to move from (4,1) to (5,1). This move will not result in the snake eating an apple, nor will it collide with itself or the walls. Therefore, the best move is to continue moving DOWN to get closer to the apples.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#H A   #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nBased on the current game board and the rules, the snake is moving DOWN and is one step away from an apple.

The best move to avoid the wall and to potentially head towards an apple is to turn 'LEFT'. This will move the snake's head to the left, avoiding the wall and potentially setting up a path to the apples on the left side of the board.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n# HS   #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nGiven the current direction of the snake is 'LEFT', and the snake is moving towards the left, the next move should be to continue moving 'LEFT' to eat the apple and grow in length. Moving in any other direction would not align with the current movement direction or would not result in an optimal path to the apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n#HS    #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nGiven the current direction is LEFT, the snake's head (H) will move to the left. However, the snake will collide with its body (S) if it continues to move LEFT. Therefore, I need to choose a direction that avoids collision with the body or the walls. The viable directions are UP or DOWN. Since moving UP will not lead to immediate danger and allows the snake to potentially find an apple, the best move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#H     #\n#S     #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nGiven the current direction and the position of the snake's head, the best move would be to move 'UP' to eat an apple and increase the score.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#H A  A#\n#S     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nGiven the current direction and the layout of the board, moving 'UP' will cause the snake to move into a wall, which would end the game. Therefore, the best move is to turn 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT' to avoid the wall and potentially move towards an apple.\n\nIf we turn 'LEFT', the snake will move to an empty space, but it will not be in immediate position to eat an apple. If we turn 'RIGHT', the snake will move towards one of the apples, which is more advantageous.\n\nThus, the best direction to move is 'RIGHT'.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#SHA  A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nBased on the current game board and the snake's direction, the snake is moving RIGHT. The head of the snake is currently at the position where it can eat an apple ('A') if it continues moving in the same direction. Therefore, the best move is to continue moving RIGHT to eat the apple and increase the score.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#SSH  A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nBased on the current game board and the direction the snake is moving, the snake's head is about to collide with an apple. The snake is currently moving RIGHT, and there is an apple directly to the right of the head. Therefore, the snake will eat the apple, grow in length, and the score will increase by 1 point. The next state of the board will be:\n\n########\n#      #\n#SSH  A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nHowever, since the snake is moving RIGHT and there is an apple directly to the right of the head, the snake will eat the apple and grow. The direction to maintain is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n# SSH A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nThe snake is currently moving to the right, and the next move should be to eat the apple. Moving RIGHT will make the snake eat the apple, grow in length, and increase the score by 1.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#  SSHA#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nBased on the current game board and the direction the snake is moving (RIGHT), the snake's head is about to collide with an apple. Moving RIGHT will lead the snake to grow and the score to increase by 1. The next state of the board will be:\n\n########\n#      #\n#  SSHA#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nHowever, since the snake is already moving RIGHT and will eat an apple, the best move is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#  SSSH#\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nGiven the current direction is RIGHT, the snake will move to the right. However, moving RIGHT would cause the snake to collide with itself, which would end the game. Therefore, the snake should not move RIGHT. The best move is to go DOWN to avoid immediate collision and to approach the apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#   SSS#\n#     H#\n# A    #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nGiven the current state of the game board and the direction of movement, the snake is moving DOWN. The head of the snake ('H') is currently at the position (3, 3) and will move to (4, 3) next. This move will result in the snake eating an apple and growing in length.\n\nThe new board state will be:\n\n########\n#      #\n#   SSS#\n#   SSS#\n# H A  #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nTherefore, the direction to give is 'DOWN'.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#    SS#\n#     S#\n# A   H#\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nBased on the current game board and the snake's direction, moving DOWN will lead the snake's head to the position where it can eat an apple. Therefore, the best move is to continue moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#     S#\n#     S#\n# A   S#\n#     H#\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nGiven the current direction is DOWN, if the snake continues to move DOWN, it will collide with the wall, ending the game. To avoid this, the best move would be to turn LEFT or RIGHT to continue moving and possibly find an apple. Turning LEFT would move the snake towards the left side of the board, which currently has an apple.\n\nThe best move is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#     S#\n# A   S#\n#    HS#\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nGiven the current direction is LEFT, the snake's head (H) will move to the left. The new position of the head will be where the body (S) is currently, and the body will follow the previous position of the head. This move will not result in the snake eating an apple or colliding with itself or the walls.\n\nThe new board will look like this:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#     S#\n# A  SS#\n#     HS#\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nSince the move is valid and does not result in eating an apple or a collision, the direction to give is the current direction, which is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A   S#\n#   HSS#\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nBased on the current board and the snake's direction, the snake is moving to the left. If it continues moving left, it will eat the apple and grow in length. There are no immediate dangers of the snake colliding with itself or the walls if it continues moving left. Therefore, the best move is to continue moving LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#  HSSS#\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nGiven the current game board and the direction the snake is moving, the snake is heading towards an apple. Moving LEFT will result in the snake eating the apple, increasing the score by 1, and the snake will grow in length.\n\nThe updated board will look like this:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n# HSSS #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n# HSSS #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nGiven the current direction is LEFT and the snake's head is at the leftmost position of the row, moving LEFT will cause the snake to collide with the wall. Therefore, the best move is to change the direction to avoid the immediate collision. Since the snake cannot reverse its direction, the options are either UP or DOWN. Moving DOWN will lead the snake towards an apple, which is a beneficial move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n# SSS  #\n#AH A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN. If it continues in this direction, it will eat an apple and grow in length. After eating the apple, the board will look like this:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n# SSS  #\n#S HA  #\n########\n\nSince the snake will eat an apple and grow, this is a valid move. The direction to give is 'DOWN'.\n\nAnswer: DOWN"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format. The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER' (without quotes), where YOUR_ANSWER is your final answer to the question,e.g.'Answer: LEFT'\n\nYou are controlling a snake in a Snake game.The board size is 8x8.In the game board. The goal of the game is to control the snake, eat as many apples as possible, and grow the snake in length. Each time the snake eats an apple, the score increases by one. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point. The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n# SSS  #\n#AH A  #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","action":"DOWN"}
