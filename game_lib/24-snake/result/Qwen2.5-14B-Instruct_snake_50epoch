The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point. The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#    SH#\n# A    #\n#  A   #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","action":"RIGHT"}

Therefore, the best immediate move is to avoid collision and position the snake for future apple consumption.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#A     #\n#   H  #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT.

Since the snake's head is currently above an apple, moving UP will make the snake eat the apple. However, the snake's head cannot move UP as it is already at the top edge of the apple's position, and moving UP would make it collide with the wall or itself, which is not the case here. Instead, we should consider the next best move which is to eat one of the other apples. Given the current direction is UP, the best move to eat another apple would be to move RIGHT, as it will not violate the rule of not reversing direction and will keep the snake on course to eat another apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#     A#\n#  A   #\n#   H  #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT.

Given the board layout, moving right will not allow the snake to eat an apple as there is no apple to the right of the head. Also, moving right or left without eating an apple does not change the length of the snake, but it is crucial to avoid collision with the walls or itself.\n\nSince the snake is heading right and there is an apple directly above the head, a strategic move would be to turn the snake up to eat an apple and increase the score. Turning left or right without eating an apple is not beneficial, and continuing straight right would not result in eating an apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#     A#\n#  A H #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is UP.

However, since the snake cannot reverse its direction, and moving UP again would just make the snake's head overlap with its body after growing, the best move would be to move RIGHT or LEFT to avoid immediate collision and to explore other apples.\n\nGiven the current setup, moving RIGHT will not result in immediate collision and might give the snake better options for future moves.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#A A   #\n#   H  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. The snake head ('H') is not adjacent to any apples in the RIGHT direction, so moving RIGHT would not result in eating an apple and would not increase the score. To maximize the score, we should aim to move the snake towards an apple.

Given the current layout, moving DOWN will not immediately lead to an apple. However, since the snake is currently headed DOWN and we should not reverse direction, we can move RIGHT first, position the snake to eat one of the apples, then continue moving DOWN to eat the other apple.\n\nFirst move RIGHT to align with an apple:\n\n########\n#A A   #\n#      #\n#A S  H#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThen move DOWN to eat an apple:\n\n########\n#A A   #\n#      #\n#A S   #\n#      #\n#      H#\n#      #\n########\n\nThen move DOWN again to eat the last apple:\n\n########\n#A A   #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      S#\n#      H#\n########\n\nGiven the current setup and rules, the optimal immediate move is RIGHT to position the snake to eat an apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#A A   #\n#      #\n#A   H #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe current direction of the snake is RIGHT. The snake's head is at position (3, 6). Moving RIGHT will make the snake eat an apple at position (3, 7) and grow by one segment. However, since the snake's body is not yet long enough to cause a collision, it will simply extend its body by one segment.\n\nThe next state of the board will be:\n########\n#A A   #\n#      #\n#A S H #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#A A   #\n#      #\n#A    H#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven the current game board and the snake's direction, the optimal move to eat an apple would be to move 'LEFT'.

Moving UP from the current position will not change the board state as there is no apple in the current direction and the snake will move out of the board and lose the game. However, as per the rules, the snake cannot move in a direction that would cause it to collide with the wall. Thus, the best immediate move should be considered avoiding the loss. Let's choose a direction that doesn't lead to an immediate loss and could potentially move closer to an apple.\n\nGiven the current position and the goal of eating an apple, moving RIGHT would be a strategic move to avoid an immediate loss and position the snake closer to an apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#    A #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    AA#\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT, and the snake head is positioned in such a way that moving RIGHT would not allow it to eat an apple on the next move. The apple is located two squares to the right of the snake's head, so moving RIGHT won't result in an immediate reward. However, moving DOWN would allow the snake to move closer to the lower apples, potentially positioning it for future moves to eat the apples.\n\nTherefore, to advance towards the apples and increase the chances of eating one, the optimal direction is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    AA#\n########\n\nThe current direction is DOWN. The snake's head is currently at the position where moving DOWN will lead it to an apple. Moving in the current direction will make the snake eat an apple, grow in length, and increase the score by 1. The next state of the board will have the snake's head at the position of the apple and the snake's body extending one step down from its current head position.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#    AA#\n########\n\nThe current direction is DOWN, and the snake's head is about to move towards an empty space. Since there is no immediate apple in the path of the snake, eating an apple is not guaranteed with the current direction. However, to grow the snake and increase the score, we need to move in a way that leads the head to an apple.\n\nGiven the layout, the optimal immediate move would be RIGHT, as it will lead the snake's head closer to one of the apples without reversing direction.\n\nAfter moving RIGHT, the board will look like this:\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    HS#\n#      #\n#    AA#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is now closer to an apple.

Since the snake's head is currently over an apple ('A') if it moves up, it would result in a collision with the wall and thus lose the game. Therefore, the best move to continue the game without immediate collision and to eat an apple is to move RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#   AA #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT, and the snake head 'H' is moving towards the right. There are apples to the right of the snake's head, so moving RIGHT will allow the snake to eat an apple and grow in length.

The closest apple can be reached by moving DOWN first, then RIGHT.\n\nHowever, since the snake cannot reverse its direction directly, and moving RIGHT does not collide the snake with walls or itself, and there is an apple in the rightmost column directly down from the head, the optimal immediate move would be to go DOWN, which will allow the snake to eat an apple on the next move if it continues RIGHT afterwards. \n\nLet's execute the move DOWN first:\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#    H #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nSince the snake is facing down, we can move it down to eat one of the apples, which will increase the score by one and make the snake grow by one segment. There are two apples on the board, but the closest one to the head (H) is directly below it. Therefore, moving DOWN will be the most efficient move to eat an apple and increase the score. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    H #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nSince the snake is currently facing down and there is no immediate danger of collision with the walls or itself, the best move to maximize the score would be to move towards the closest apple. In this case, moving DOWN will allow the snake to eat an apple. So, the direction I will give is:\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A  H #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe current direction is DOWN, and the snake head 'H' is on the edge of an apple 'A'. Moving DOWN will cause the snake to eat the apple and grow in length. Since there are no immediate obstacles or threats to the snake, and the apple is directly below the head, the best action is to move DOWN to eat the apple and continue growing.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#    H #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake is currently at the bottom of the board, and the nearest apple is directly above it. Moving DOWN would not be beneficial as there is no apple in that direction and it would lead the snake into a collision with the wall. The optimal move would be to move UP to eat the apple. However, since the snake cannot reverse its direction directly, and since moving LEFT or RIGHT would not lead to an apple and might trap the snake, moving UP is the best possible action.\n\nAnswer: UP"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

To maximize the score, the best immediate move would be to eat one of the apples directly above the head. However, there are no apples directly above, so the next best option is to position the snake to eat an apple on the next move. Moving to the LEFT or RIGHT will not immediately result in the snake eating an apple, but moving LEFT will place the snake in a position to potentially eat one of the apples in the next move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n# A    #\n#  A   #\n# H    #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake is currently facing LEFT. Since the snake's head is not immediately adjacent to an apple and moving left would not result in immediate collision with the wall or itself, there is no immediate need to change the direction. However, to make the snake eat an apple effectively, we should consider the next move to align with an apple.\n\nLooking at the board, if the snake moves LEFT, it will not eat an apple immediately and will instead move away from the nearest apple located at (1, 1). By changing the direction to DOWN, the snake can start moving towards the apple located at (3, 1).\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n# A    #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n# H    #\n#      #\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently in the DOWN direction and the head of the snake is 2 rows away from eating an apple. Since the snake is facing DOWN and the apple is directly below the head, moving DOWN will allow the snake to eat an apple. Therefore, the best move is to keep moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n# A    #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n# H    #\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe current direction is DOWN, and the snake head 'H' is positioned in a way that moving DOWN will not immediately result in eating an apple or colliding with a wall or itself. However, the most strategic move to maximize the chance of eating an apple in the next step or setting up for future apples would be to move towards one of the apples. \n\nConsidering the positions of the apples and the current direction, moving RIGHT would align the snake with the closest apple that is in line with the current direction.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n# A    #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n# A    #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT. The snake is currently moving to the right. The best move would be to keep moving RIGHT to eat one of the apples. However, there is only one apple directly to the right of the head that can be eaten this way. Given the current direction and the position of the apples, moving RIGHT will not immediately put the snake in a dangerous position.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n# A    #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   H  #\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT. The snake's head is about to move to the right.

The snake head is at the fifth row and sixth column. Moving right will not immediately lead to an apple or an immediate collision. However, given the current direction and the possibility of future moves, we should consider the placement of apples and the direction constraints. The best immediate move to maximize the potential to eat an apple while avoiding walls and the snake's body would be to move RIGHT, as it does not risk immediate collision and keeps the snake aligned for future potential moves.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n# A    #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     H#\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT.

However, since the question does not specify a need to avoid losing but rather asks for a direction, I will provide a direction that theoretically continues the game without immediate loss, even though it's not optimal in this scenario given the constraints. \n\nGiven that the snake cannot reverse direction and the only direction not immediately leading to an end is LEFT or RIGHT, and considering the apples are positioned to the right of the snake, the optimal choice to continue pursuing the goal (eating apples) would be to move towards the apples. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A A  A#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe current direction of the snake is RIGHT.

However, as there are apples to the right of the current head position, let's move RIGHT to see if the snake can eat an apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#    H #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A A  A#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe current direction of the snake is RIGHT, and the snake is positioned in such a way that it can move towards the apples without immediate risk of collision. Since the snake's head is currently at the right edge of the board in a column that has apples below it, moving DOWN will allow the snake to eat an apple and grow in length.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    H #\n#      #\n#A A  A#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is currently at the position where it can move down to eat the closest apple. Since the snake is currently moving in the 'DOWN' direction and there's no immediate need to change direction to avoid collision or to target a different apple more efficiently, the best move for now is to keep moving 'DOWN'.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    H #\n#A A  A#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is currently at position (4, 5) moving DOWN. There are three apples located at (5, 1), (5, 2), and (5, 3). Since the snake is moving DOWN, the next logical move to eat an apple would be to continue moving DOWN. However, since the board is empty below and the snake would not eat an apple by moving DOWN immediately, we should consider the next best move which would be to set up a position to eat an apple on the next move.\n\nGiven that the snake is currently not in a position to eat an apple immediately by moving DOWN and there is no immediate danger of collision, the best initial move would be to position the snake closer to the apples. Moving LEFT would start positioning the snake to be able to eat an apple on its next DOWN move or move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   H  #\n#A A  A#\n#      #\n########\n\nSince the snake is currently facing LEFT and there are no apples directly to the left of the head, moving LEFT would not be beneficial as it does not lead to an apple. The best immediate move would be to move DOWN to reach the apples below. \n\nAfter moving DOWN, the snake will eat an apple and grow in length. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A AH A#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is currently positioned right above the apple 'A' on its right. The snake is moving downwards, so the next move will be 'DOWN' to eat the middle apple and grow the snake. Therefore, moving 'DOWN' is the optimal move to increase the score.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A A  A#\n#   H  #\n########\n\nGiven the current state of the board and the snake's current direction, moving the snake in the DOWN direction will allow it to eat the closest apple.

The optimal move would be to move RIGHT, which would make the snake eat an apple and grow longer. However, moving RIGHT would lead the snake into a wall.

Since the snake is heading 'UP' and there is no apple directly above the head, we should consider moving to the nearest apple to maximize the score. Moving to the apple on the left or right would not be effective as it would lead the snake away from the apples and also would not immediately increase the score. The most logical move would be to move towards the apple directly in front of the head.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#  A   #\n#  AH  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe current direction is UP, and the snake head 'H' is about to move in that direction. If it moves up, it will collide with the wall above the top edge of the board, which means the game would end. However, there are apples ('A') to the right of the snake head.\n\nTherefore, to avoid losing the game and to eat an apple, the best move is to change the direction to the RIGHT and move in that direction instead.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#  A   #\n#  A H #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT, so the snake's head is at 'H' and it's moving towards the right. To eat an apple ('A') and grow the snake, we should move the snake towards one of the apples. The closest apple to the head of the snake is directly to the right of 'H'. However, moving directly RIGHT will not be beneficial as there is no apple directly right of 'H', and we will just move into an empty space. The best move would be to turn DOWN to eat the apple directly below the head.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#  A   #\n#  A   #\n#    H #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe current direction is DOWN. Since the snake's head ('H') is in the third row and there are apples in the first and second rows, moving DOWN would not result in eating an apple immediately. However, considering the long-term goal of eating as many apples as possible, moving towards the nearest apple makes sense. \n\nIn this case, moving DOWN will not immediately result in eating an apple, but it keeps the snake moving towards the lower part of the board where an apple is present. Therefore, the best immediate direction to move is DOWN, though it will not result in eating an apple in this turn.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#  A   #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#    H #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe current direction is DOWN, and the head of the snake ('H') is about to move down. The square below 'H' contains an apple ('A'), so moving DOWN will allow the snake to eat the apple and grow in length. Therefore, the best move is to keep moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#  A   #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    H #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. Since the head of the snake (H) is currently in the 6th row and 6th column, moving DOWN will make the snake to move to the 7th row and 6th column, where there is an apple. Therefore, the snake will eat the apple, grow in length, and the score will increase by 1.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#  A   #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    HA#\n########\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. Since the head of the snake ('H') is located at the bottom of a column with two apples ('A'), moving DOWN will not immediately result in the snake eating an apple. The snake can move LEFT or RIGHT to eat an apple. However, since the snake is currently moving DOWN, it can only change direction to LEFT or RIGHT (not UP or DOWN directly). Moving LEFT will allow the snake to eat one of the apples directly above its head. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#  A   #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   H A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT. The snake head 'H' is at the bottom-left of one of the apples. Moving LEFT would cause the snake to collide with the wall, which would end the game. Moving DOWN would not be a valid option because the direction cannot be reversed directly from LEFT to DOWN. The best move to avoid collision and eat an apple is to move RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#  A   #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  H  A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction is LEFT, and the snake head 'H' is about to move left.

The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A  S #\n#   AHA#\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","action":"DOWN"}

Since the goal is to eat as many apples as possible, and the current direction is UP, the snake will eat an apple if it moves UP. Moving in any other direction would not immediately lead to eating an apple and would deviate from the optimal path. Thus, the best move is to continue in the current direction.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#  HA  #\n#      #\n# A    #\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe current direction is UP, and the snake's head ('H') is in the middle of the board, with two apples ('A') below it. Since the snake is currently not in contact with any apples and the direction is UP, the best immediate action to consider is to avoid reversing direction and potentially align the snake to move towards the apples in the next step. Given the current setup, moving DOWN would be the best immediate action to start aligning the snake to consume the apples below.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n# A    #\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe current direction is UP, and the snake head 'H' is one step above an apple 'A'. Moving UP will not yield any benefits since there is nothing to eat in that direction and the snake cannot move out of the board. Thus, the optimal move would be to move RIGHT to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#   H  #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n# A    #\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT, and the snake's head is about to move over an apple. To maximize the score, we should keep the direction RIGHT to eat the apple. After eating the apple, the snake will grow, and the board will update accordingly.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#    H #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n# A    #\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe current direction of the snake is RIGHT. Since the snake is heading right and the next cell is empty, moving right would not result in eating an apple. However, the next apple is located to the right of the snake's head. Therefore, the optimal move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#     H#\n#   A  #\n#      #\n# A    #\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT, and the snake head 'H' is about to move in that direction. Moving RIGHT will not make the snake eat an apple, so the snake will just move to the right and increase in length by one segment at the back. However, we should check to see if there is a better move that can make the snake eat an apple, as the goal is to eat as many apples as possible and grow the snake.\n\nLooking at the board, moving RIGHT will not lead to an apple. Moving DOWN would place the snake head over an apple. Therefore, to maximize the score, the best move is to go DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A H#\n#      #\n# A    #\n# A    #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. The snake's head is at the position where 'H' is, and there is an apple ('A') directly below the snake's head. Moving DOWN will allow the snake to eat the apple and grow in length.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#     H#\n# A    #\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe current direction is DOWN. Since the head of the snake (H) is one step away from an apple ('A') and there is no immediate wall or part of the snake body blocking its path, moving DOWN will allow the snake to eat an apple and grow. Thus, the next logical move is to maintain the current direction, which is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n# A   H#\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe current direction of the snake is DOWN, and the snake's head is just above an apple. Moving DOWN will make the snake eat the apple and grow by one segment.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n# A    #\n# A   H#\n########\n\nThe snake is currently at the bottom of the board with its head ('H') at position (6, 6) and an apple ('A') just to the left of it. The current direction is DOWN, meaning the snake will move down if we do not change the direction. To eat the apple, we should change the direction to LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n# A    #\n# A  H #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nSince the current direction is LEFT, the snake's head is at the position (6, 6) and it will move to (6, 5) if it continues in the same direction. However, there is an apple at (6, 5), so the snake will eat the apple, grow in length, and the apple will be replaced by a part of the snake's body. Therefore, the optimal move here is to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n# A    #\n# A H  #\n########\n\nThe current direction of the snake is LEFT. In this situation, if the snake moves LEFT from its current position, it will collide with the wall, ending the game. Therefore, to avoid losing, the snake should not move LEFT. Instead, the snake can move DOWN to eat an apple and increase its length. However, since the rules state the snake cannot reverse its direction directly, and moving LEFT is the only immediate dangerous move, the best move considering the rules and the objective of growing the snake would be to move in a non-reversing direction that avoids immediate collision, which is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.
