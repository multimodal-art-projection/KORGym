The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#HA   A#\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","action":"DOWN"}

The goal of the game is to control the snake, eat as many apples as possible, and grow the snake in length. Each time the snake eats an apple, the score increases by one. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point. The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#A    A#\n#      #\n# S    #\n#SS    #\n#HA    #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","action":"LEFT"}

The goal of the game is to control the snake, eat as many apples as possible, and grow the snake in length. Each time the snake eats an apple, the score increases by one. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point. The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#SS   A#\n#H   A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","action":"LEFT"}

The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point.

The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point. The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#   A  #\n#    A #\n#SHA   #\n#SS    #\n# SS   #\n#  S   #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","action":"DOWN"}

The goal of the game is to control the snake, eat as many apples as possible, and grow the snake in length. Each time the snake eats an apple, the score increases by one. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point. The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S    #\n#SS    #\n#HAAA  #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","action":"DOWN"}

The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER' (without quotes), where YOUR_ANSWER is your final answer to the question,e.g.'Answer: LEFT'\n\nYou are controlling a snake in a Snake game.The board size is 8x8.In the game board. The goal of the game is to control the snake, eat as many apples as possible, and grow the snake in length. Each time the snake eats an apple, the score increases by one. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point. The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#   HS #\n#   SS #\n#  SS A#\n#  SS A#\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","action":"DOWN"}
