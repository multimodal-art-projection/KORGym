However, if the snake moves up, it will hit the wall before reaching the apple. Therefore, we need to change the direction to either 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT'.

Considering there's an apple to the right, moving down would be a safer choice as it gives more flexibility for the next move and also gets closer to the apple below.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#A     #\n#  H   #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is 'DOWN' and the snake's head is at the bottom row, giving another 'DOWN' command would make the snake collide with the wall. The best option is to move 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT' to avoid the collision and continue the game. Considering the position of the apples, moving 'LEFT' would not lead to any immediate benefits. However, moving 'RIGHT' would not lead to immediate benefits as well. The best option seems to be moving in the direction that has the potential to reach an apple in a shorter path, moving 'LEFT' is a safer choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#A     #\n# H    #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is LEFT and there's no wall or the snake's body to the left, the snake can move left. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#A     #\n#H     #\n########\n\n\nSince the snake is currently moving LEFT and there is no wall or itself in the way, the optimal move would be to continue moving LEFT to explore the board and potentially find more apples.

However, moving LEFT will allow the snake to have more options for its next move. \n\nTherefore, the direction to give is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n# H  A #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nAccording to the current state of the game board, the snake is moving LEFT and its head is at the position '# H  A #'. If it keeps moving LEFT, it will collide with the wall. Therefore, I will change the direction to UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n# A    #\n# H    #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n########\n\n\nSince the snake is currently moving 'UP' and there is no apple above it, the snake will move up one square. However, considering the snake's length and current position, moving up would put the snake in a position to potentially eat an apple on its next move, but it's not the optimal move in this situation. A better move would be to change direction to 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT' in order to align the snake with the apple on the left side of the board, but since the current direction is 'UP' and we can't reverse it, moving 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT' would not be possible in the next move.\n\nHowever, since the snake cannot reverse its direction, and moving 'UP' would be the default action, the player needs to think ahead. Considering the current board and the fact that we can't reverse the direction, I will choose 'LEFT' for the next move but since we are moving 'UP' currently it would be possible only after the next move. So for now, we have to move 'UP'. But I will give the answer 'LEFT' assuming the player is thinking ahead.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n# A    #\n#H     #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is LEFT, the snake will move left. However, the snake is already at the left edge of the board and cannot move further left without colliding with the wall. To avoid collision, I need to change the direction. Considering the current position of the snake and the apples, I will move the snake up to get closer to the apple. \n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nIn this situation, the snake is moving up. To avoid hitting the wall, we need to change the direction. Since the snake cannot move down (it's the opposite direction), it can move either left or right. There's no apple to the left, so it's better to move right to potentially get closer to the apples.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#SH    #\n#      #\n#    AA#\n#      #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is RIGHT, I need to give a direction that will not make the snake collide with itself or the walls, and will also try to eat an apple if possible. \n\nThe snake's head is currently at the rightmost part of the board, so moving RIGHT again will make it collide with the wall. Therefore, I will give the direction 'DOWN'. This will allow the snake to move downwards and potentially eat an apple in the future.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n# S    #\n# H    #\n#    AA#\n#      #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nSince the snake is currently moving 'DOWN', the next 'DOWN' move will cause the snake to collide with the walls. However, moving 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT' will not eat an apple immediately. Moving 'LEFT' would be a safer option to avoid collision with the walls for now.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#HS    #\n#    AA#\n#      #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is LEFT, I will give a direction that doesn't reverse the current direction. To avoid colliding with the wall, I will change the direction to UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#H     #\n#S     #\n#    AA#\n#      #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is 'UP' and there's no apple or obstacle in the way, the best move would be to keep moving in the 'UP' direction.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#H     #\n#S     #\n#      #\n#    AA#\n#      #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nUP is the current direction.In this direction, the snake will hit the wall and lose the game. Therefore, to avoid losing, I need to change the direction. Since there is no apple in the up direction, and the current direction is UP, the best move would be to move to the 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT', considering the current position of the apples.\n\nBut given the snake's current position and direction, moving 'LEFT' would be a better option because moving 'RIGHT' would give a less chance of eating the apple and meanwhile moving 'LEFT' will not hit the wall.\n\nAnswer: LEFT"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Therefore, moving down is the only viable option.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n# A    #\n#      #\n#      #\n# H  A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is 'DOWN' and moving down would cause the snake to collide with the wall, I will change the direction to 'RIGHT' to move towards the apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n# A    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  H A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nSince the snake is currently moving to the 'RIGHT', the 'H' will move to the 'A' on its right.

However, if I move it to the right again, it will collide with the wall. Therefore, I will move it down to avoid collision and potentially get closer to the apple below.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n# A    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#   H A#\n#      #\n########\n\nSince the snake is currently moving 'DOWN' and there's an apple below it, the best direction to continue would be 'DOWN', but that is not allowed as an answer since it is already moving down.

If the snake continues moving left, it will eat the apple and grow in length. Since the snake cannot reverse its direction, the possible directions to move are 'LEFT' or 'UP' or 'DOWN'. Considering the current state, moving 'UP' would be a better option as it doesn't lead to collision with the walls and allows the snake to potentially eat more apples in the future.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n# A    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  H A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nIn this situation, the best direction to move the snake is to the LEFT, which will allow the snake to eat an apple and avoid any potential collisions with the wall or itself. Also, moving LEFT will allow the snake to move towards the center of the board and have more space to maneuver.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n# A    #\n#      #\n#      #\n# H  A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nAccording to the game board, the snake is moving LEFT and there's an apple to its left. To eat the apple and increase the score, the snake should change its direction to UP to get the apple above, or keep its direction to LEFT to eat the apple on the left, however, the snake is already moving to LEFT and will eat the apple on the left. After eating the apple on the left, the snake should change its direction to UP to get the apple above, or change its direction to DOWN, but it cannot reverse its direction, so the snake should change its direction to UP to get the apple above.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n# A    #\n#      #\n# H    #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nSince the snake is currently moving up and there's an empty space above the head, I will continue moving in the same direction to potentially position the snake for an apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n# A    #\n# H    #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\n\nSince the snake is moving in the 'UP' direction and there is an apple above it, the best move would be to continue moving up to eat the apple and increase the score.\n\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#AH    #\n# S    #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#HS    #\n# S    #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe next direction should keep the snake moving left, but since it's already at the left edge, we should turn it to avoid collision with the wall. However, the snake cannot reverse its direction, so we can only turn it 'UP' or 'DOWN'. I would suggest turning it 'UP' to avoid the wall and continue the game. \n\nAnswer: UP"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

However, moving up will not eat an apple or change the score. But the snake will move to the square above it.\n\n\nTo eat an apple and increase the score, we need to move left. Since the snake is moving 'UP' and cannot reverse direction, it can move 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT'. The best choice is to move 'LEFT' to eat an apple in the future.\n\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#A A   #\n#     A#\n#      #\n# H    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is LEFT, the snake will move to the left. However, since the snake is already at the leftmost position it can be in the current column without going out of bounds, it will remain in the same column but the snake's body will change to the left position of the head.\n\n\nThe snake should move down to have the opportunity to eat an apple but since we can't move the snake down because the snake can't reverse its direction, we can only move the snake in either the UP or LEFT direction. Given the board layout, moving the snake LEFT is not beneficial because the snake will not eat any apple. Moving the snake UP is more beneficial because the snake is closer to the upper apples.\n\n\nSo, to move the snake to have an opportunity to eat an apple, we should move it UP, but we should change the direction to LEFT then move UP to have more chance to eat the apples on the left side. However, we can't change the direction to LEFT then move UP because we can only give one direction at a time.\n\n\nTherefore, the best choice is to change the direction of the snake to UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#A A   #\n#     A#\n# H    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nSince the snake is currently moving up and there is an apple above it, the best direction to move is UP to eat the apple. However, as there is no more space to go up and it will hit itself or the wall if goes up, the snake should change its direction to LEFT to avoid hitting the wall and prepare for the next move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#A A   #\n#     A#\n#H     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is 'LEFT', the snake will move one square to the left. However, the snake's head is at the leftmost column, so it will collide with the wall if it moves left. To avoid this, we need to change the direction.\n\nConsidering the board and the current position of the snake, I would suggest moving the snake 'UP' to avoid collision and be in a better position to eat an apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#A A   #\n#H    A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is 'UP', the snake will move up.

To avoid this and potentially eat an apple, the best move would be to change direction to either UP or DOWN.\n\nGiven the current state of the board, moving UP would not result in eating an apple immediately, whereas moving DOWN does not provide an immediate benefit either. However, since the current direction is RIGHT, and we cannot reverse direction (i.e., move LEFT), the choice is between UP and DOWN.\n\nConsidering the placement of the apples and the goal to grow the snake in length by eating apples, moving DOWN does not seem to offer an immediate benefit but keeps the snake in the game, allowing for future moves that could potentially align the snake with an apple.\n\nHowever, since the snake is already as far right as it can go without hitting the wall, and moving DOWN does not immediately yield a benefit (eating an apple), and moving UP also doesn't offer an immediate apple, but avoids the wall and keeps options open for future moves, the most strategic move under the given conditions and aiming for potential future alignment with an apple, especially considering the wall and the inability to reverse direction immediately, would be to move UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#A A  H#\n#     S#\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the next direction, I will analyze the current state of the board. Since the current direction is 'UP', the snake is moving upwards. There is an apple ('A') above the snake's head, but it's currently blocked by the wall of apples to its left and right, and there's another 'A' directly above it's head. The snake will need to navigate carefully to eat the apple without hitting the wall or itself. Considering the current position of the snake and the available apples, I will choose a direction that allows the snake to move towards an apple without immediately hitting the wall.\n\nSince there is an apple to the left of the snake, I can move to the left to get closer to the apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#A A HS#\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, I will analyze the current state of the board.

The best direction to eat the apple and avoid collision is to turn RIGHT to align with the apple below.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  H  A#\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is 'RIGHT' and the snake is moving towards an apple, to continue eating the apple and growing in length, the best direction would be to continue moving 'RIGHT'. However, since the snake cannot reverse its direction, and moving 'RIGHT' again might lead to a collision with the wall, I would recommend a different direction to avoid collision. \n\nConsidering the current state of the board, the best direction to avoid collision and potentially move towards another apple would be to move 'DOWN'. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#  H   #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nSince the snake is moving DOWN and the next cell contains an apple 'A', the snake will eat the apple, grow in length, and the score will increase by 1.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#  HA  #\n########\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A   A#\n#      #\n#  SH  #\n########\n\nSince the snake's current direction is RIGHT, and there are no obstacles or apples in the immediate right path, the best move would be to continue moving RIGHT. However, considering the board layout, moving RIGHT will not lead to an apple and might limit future moves. Given the snake's position and direction, a better move would be to change direction to avoid potential collisions and reach the apples more efficiently.\n\nConsidering the snake cannot reverse its direction, a suitable move would be to turn LEFT to change the direction and prepare for future moves towards the apples.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A   A#\n#      #\n#   SH #\n########\n\nAccording to the game board and rules, the best direction to move the snake is 'UP'. \n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A   A#\n#    H #\n#    S #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is UP, the snake will keep moving up. \n\nThe snake's head is currently at the 6th row and it will move up to the 5th row. There is an apple on the 5th row, but it is not in the same column as the snake's head. So, the snake will not eat the apple in this move.\n\nHowever, considering the next possible moves, I will give the direction 'LEFT'. This will make the snake move left in the next step and prepare it to eat the apple in the next move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A   A#\n#   HS #\n#      #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is 'LEFT' and the snake cannot reverse its direction, I need to choose a direction that is not 'RIGHT'. Also, moving down would not make the snake eat the apple immediately. Therefore, moving 'UP' would be a good direction as it does not change the current left direction to its opposite direction 'RIGHT', and the snake can still move towards the apple on the left.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A H A#\n#   S  #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, I will analyze the current state of the board. Since the current direction is 'UP', the snake cannot move 'DOWN' as it would be reversing its direction. The best option would be to move 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT'. Moving 'LEFT' would allow the snake to eat an apple and increase its score. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n# AHS A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is 'LEFT', the snake will move to the left. In the given state, moving left will not cause any collision with the walls or itself. The snake will move one step to the left.\n\nIn this state, I will give the direction 'LEFT' to move the snake. Since there is no apple in the left square, the snake will just move one step and no score will increase.\n\nHowever, I was asked to give the answer in the required format. Considering the snake will not eat any apple in the left square and the direction is 'LEFT', the best next direction to eat an apple would be 'DOWN'. But in the next step, it can be 'LEFT' to eat the apple on the left side. Considering this, the answer is 'DOWN' to move to the left apple in the next step.\n\n Answer: DOWN","Game board:\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n# AS  A#\n#  H   #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nDirection to move: LEFT\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A   A#\n# HS   #\n#      #\n########\n\n\nSince the snake is moving left and there are no obstacles or apples in its immediate path, the best direction to continue is LEFT.\n\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A   A#\n#HS    #\n#      #\n########\n\nAccording to the given game board and rules, the snake is moving LEFT and there's an apple to its left.

The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#H   A #\n#S     #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","action":"LEFT"}

The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point.

However, we should change direction soon to avoid hitting the wall.\n\nThe snake will hit the wall if we continue moving 'UP'. Since there's an apple on the left, we should move towards it. We can't move left directly because the snake can't reverse direction, so we'll move right to prepare for a future left turn. But for now, let's keep moving up.\n\nHowever, based on the given rules, the snakes cannot move UP as there is the wall. So let's move RIGHT first, to avoid hitting the wall and prepare for a future left turn.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   H  #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving to the right, and it's heading towards the wall. To avoid collision with the wall, I should change the direction to either 'UP' or 'DOWN'. Considering the current position of the snake and the apples, moving 'UP' would not lead to an immediate collision with the apple, but moving 'DOWN' would bring the snake closer to an apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A H  #\n#      #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is 'DOWN', the snake is already moving down and is close to the apple on the left. However, moving down further will not allow the snake to eat the apple. The snake needs to move left to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# AH   #\n#      #\n########\n\nSince the snake is currently moving LEFT, and there are no obstacles or apples in the immediate left direction, I will provide the direction 'LEFT'.\n\nHowever, after moving left, the snake will be out of the board. So, to prevent the snake from colliding with the wall, I will provide the direction 'UP'.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\n\nSince the current direction is UP and the snake's head is at the position 'H', moving UP would cause the snake to collide with the wall. Therefore, to avoid collision, I will change the direction to LEFT.\n\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#      #\n# H    #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake is moving to the left and there is an 'A' to the left of the snake. To eat the 'A' and increase the score, the snake should continue moving to the left. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#H     #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake is moving LEFT and will hit the wall. In order to prevent the snake from hitting the wall, I need to change the direction. I will give the direction 'UP' to move upwards.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#H     #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is 'UP', moving in this direction would cause the snake to run into the wall. Therefore, to avoid losing the game and maintain the current score, the best move would be to change the direction.\n\nConsidering the positions of the apples and the current position of the snake, a suitable direction change would be to the 'RIGHT' (or 'LEFT' but there are two 'A's on the right side). However, to make the snake longer, I choose the 'RIGHT' direction.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#   AA #\n#      #\n# H    #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\n\nAccording to the game board and the current direction, the snake is moving to the right. There are no apples or obstacles in the way, so it will keep moving in the same direction.\n\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nSince the snake is moving to the RIGHT and there's no wall or obstacle in the way, I will keep moving the snake to the RIGHT. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is RIGHT and there are no obstacles in that direction, I'll continue moving the snake to the RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#    H #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the next direction, I will analyze the current state of the board and the snake's position. Since the snake is moving RIGHT and there is an apple to its right, it would be optimal to continue moving in the same direction to eat the apple and increase the score. However, moving RIGHT one more step would make the snake collide with the wall. Therefore, my next direction would be to move DOWN to avoid collision and position the snake for the next move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    H #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is 'DOWN' and there's an apple below the snake, the best move would be to keep moving down to eat the apple and increase the score.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A  H #\n#      #\n########\n\nSince the snake is currently moving DOWN and there's an apple directly below it, it would be best to continue moving down to eat the apple and increase the score.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#    H #\n########\n\nAccording to the game board and rules, the best direction to move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     H#\n########\n\n\nSince the snake is currently moving to the right and there are no obstacles or apples in its immediate path, I will keep the current direction. However, since the snake will hit the wall if it continues to the right, I need to change the direction to avoid collision.

If it continues to move up, it will hit the wall and lose the game. To avoid this, I should change the direction.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n# H    #\n#  A   #\n#    A #\n########\n\nSince the snake is moving LEFT and the current head position is at the H, the snake is now at the left wall of the board and cannot move in that direction. The snake needs to change direction. Considering the current state of the board and the position of the apples, I would suggest moving the snake UP to avoid collision with the wall and to position itself for eating the apples.\n\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#    A #\n# H    #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#    A #\n########\n\n\nIn this state, if the snake moves UP, it will collide with the wall. Therefore, the snake needs to change direction. Since the snake cannot reverse its direction, it can only turn LEFT or RIGHT. \n\nConsidering the position of the apples, turning LEFT would not lead to an immediate collision with the wall or itself. On the other hand, turning RIGHT would also not lead to an immediate collision but would move the snake closer to the apple on its right side.\n\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#    A #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is RIGHT, the snake is moving to the right. However, if we continue moving to the right, the snake will collide with the wall. So, we need to change the direction.\n\nConsidering the positions of the apples and the snake's current position, we can move LEFT or UP to avoid collision and potentially eat an apple. However, since we cannot reverse the direction directly, we will move LEFT or UP in the next step.\n\nFor now, we can move LEFT to avoid collision and potentially eat an apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#    A #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is 'RIGHT' and the snake's head is already at the rightmost apple, the next best move to eat an apple would be 'DOWN'. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#   H  #\n#  A   #\n#    A #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is 'DOWN' and there's an apple 'A' in that direction, I'll move the snake 'DOWN' to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  AH  #\n#    A #\n########\n\nSince the snake is moving DOWN and there's an apple directly below it, the best direction to continue is still DOWN, so the snake can eat the apple and increase the score.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#   HA #\n########\n\nSince the snake is currently moving 'DOWN', it will collide with the wall if it continues moving 'DOWN'. Given the snake's current position and the available apples, the best move would be to move 'LEFT' to avoid the wall and potentially position itself for future moves towards the apples.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#  H A #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT, to avoid hitting the wall, I need to change direction. Since the snake cannot reverse its direction, I can only turn RIGHT or UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  HA  #\n#  S A #\n########\n\nSince the snake is moving UP and the current position of the snake's head is at the 'H' and the apple is at the same column, moving UP will make the snake collide with itself. So I will give the direction as LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# HSA  #\n#    A #\n########\n\nAccording to the game state, the snake's head 'H' is moving in the 'LEFT' direction. In this case, the snake's head will move to the left side of the board, but it will still be within the board boundaries and will not collide with itself or the walls. The snake will not eat an apple in this move.\n\nTo make the snake eat an apple, we should change the direction to 'DOWN'. However, since the current direction is 'LEFT', we cannot directly turn 'LEFT' to 'DOWN'. Therefore, the best move in this situation would be to continue moving 'LEFT' and prepare to turn 'DOWN' in the next move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#HS A  #\n#    A #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is LEFT, the snake will move left. However, moving left will make the snake hit the left wall. Therefore, I will give the direction 'DOWN' to avoid hitting the wall and aiming to eat the apple.\n\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#S  A  #\n#H   A #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN and its head is at the position #H. To increase the score and eat an apple, the snake should continue moving DOWN. However, if it moves DOWN, it will collide with the wall. So, the best direction to give is RIGHT, the snake will not eat an apple in this step but it can continue the game and prepare for the next step to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#SH  A #\n########\n\n\nThe snake should avoid hitting the wall, itself and try to eat as many apples as possible. Given the current state of the board, the snake is heading to the right and there is an apple in that direction, the best move for the snake is to continue moving to the right to eat the apple.\n\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n# SH A #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is 'RIGHT', the snake will keep moving to the right. However, since the snake is already at the rightmost apple, the next move will make the snake collide with the wall. Therefore, to avoid collision, the snake should move 'UP'.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  HA  #\n#  S A #\n########\n\nI will analyze the board to determine the best direction for the snake to move. Since the current direction is UP and there is an apple directly below the snake's head, the best move would be to continue moving UP to eat the apple and increase the score.\n\nHowever, I need to move in a direction that will allow the snake to eat the apple and also set up for the next move. Since moving UP would cause the snake to collide with the wall, I will move the snake to the LEFT to position it for the next move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# HSA  #\n#    A #\n########\n\n\nAccording to the game board, the snake's head is at the leftmost position, and it is moving LEFT. To avoid colliding with the wall, I need to change the direction. Since the snake cannot reverse its direction, I will turn it 'UP' to eat the apple on the top.\n\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n# H    #\n# S A  #\n#    A #\n########\n\nAccording to the game board, the snake's current direction is 'UP'. The snake's head is at position (4,2) and the apple is at position (2,4). The snake can eat the apple by moving 'UP' but there is another 'A' at (6,4), so it is better to move 'LEFT' so that the snake head don't hit the boundary and have more chance to get the other 'A' \n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#HS    #\n#   A  #\n#    A #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is LEFT, the snake's head will move to the left. Considering the current state of the board and the snake's direction, the best next move to make is to continue moving LEFT, but that will make the snake hit the wall. We should change the direction to avoid the wall.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#H     #\n#S     #\n#   A  #\n#    A #\n########\n\nTo determine the best next move, let's analyze the current state of the board. Since the snake is moving 'UP' and the head 'H' is at the top of the body 'S', the snake can move 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT' without reversing its direction.\n\nLooking at the board, there are three apples ('A') placed horizontally. Moving 'LEFT' would put the snake in a good position to potentially eat the apples in the future. However, moving 'RIGHT' would put the snake closer to two apples.\n\nConsidering the current direction is 'UP' and to avoid hitting the wall, I will give the direction to move the snake to the right.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#SH    #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#    A #\n########\n\nBased on the current game board and the current direction 'RIGHT', the snake is moving to the right. To increase the chances of eating an apple and growing in length, I will give the direction 'RIGHT' to continue moving in the same direction.\n\nHowever, since the snake has already moved to the right and there are no more empty spaces in the current row to the right, we should consider changing direction to avoid hitting the wall. We can see that there are no apples to the left, but there are apples below. In this case, I should change the direction from 'RIGHT' to 'DOWN' to move the snake down towards the apples.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#    A #\n# S    #\n# H    #\n#   A  #\n#    A #\n########\n\nAccording to the game board, the snake is moving down and there's an apple below the snake's head. To eat the apple and increase the score, the snake should continue moving down.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n# S    #\n# H A  #\n#    A #\n########\n\nSince the snake is currently moving DOWN and there's an apple ('A') in the same direction, I'll keep moving DOWN to eat the apple and increase the score.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S A  #\n# H  A #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is DOWN and there's an apple below the snake, we can continue moving down to eat the apple and grow the snake. However, moving down again would cause the snake to collide with the wall. So, the best move would be to move to the RIGHT to avoid collision and position ourselves for the next move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n# SH A #\n########\n\nIn this situation, the snake can eat an apple by moving to the right. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#  SHA #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is RIGHT and the snake's head (H) is at the rightmost side of its body, the snake needs to continue moving to the right to avoid colliding with itself. \n\nHowever, there is no space to the right, so to avoid hitting the wall, we need to change the direction. The snake can only move UP or DOWN without reversing its direction. Considering the position of the apples, moving UP seems like a safe choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#   A  #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   H  #\n#  SSA #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is UP, the snake's head 'H' is moving up. Given the current state of the board, I need to decide the direction for the snake's next move. Considering the position of the apples and the snake's body, the best move would be to move LEFT to avoid collision and be in a better position to eat the apples in the future.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#   A  #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  HS  #\n#   SA #\n########\n\nSince the snake is currently moving LEFT, it will hit the wall.

The goal of the game is to control the snake, eat as many apples as possible, and grow the snake in length. Each time the snake eats an apple, the score increases by one. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point.

The snake cannot move UP as it would collide with the wall. It also cannot move DOWN as it would reverse its direction, which is not allowed. To the LEFT and RIGHT, there are no obstacles or apples that would cause the snake to lose the game. However, since the goal is to eat as many apples as possible, the best move would be to move towards an apple.\n\nConsidering the arrangement of apples on the board, moving LEFT or RIGHT would put the snake in a better position to eat an apple in the next move.\n\nSince there are no apples to the LEFT that are closer, the best move would be to move RIGHT, which would put the snake in a better position to eat an apple in the next move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#   H  #\n# A    #\n# A    #\n########\n\n\nThe snake is moving RIGHT and there is an apple to the right of the snake's head. However, the snake can't eat that apple in the current direction. If I keep the snake moving RIGHT, it will hit the wall and lose the game. The best direction to move is UP, because there is an apple above the snake's head.\n\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   H  #\n#   S  #\n# A    #\n#AA    #\n########\n\nAccording to the game board and the rules, the snake's current direction is UP and there are no apples or obstacles directly above it, but moving up would result in collision with the wall. Moving left would not make sense as there are no apples or obstacles in that direction. The snake can move right, but that also does not make sense because there is no apple in that direction. The snake can move down which would bring the snake closer to the apples.\n\nSo, the best direction is 'DOWN' in this case, but I can not move down because I can not reverse the direction, so I should move left or right to prepare move down in next step.\n\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#  HS  #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#AA    #\n########\n\nIn this situation, I will give the direction 'DOWN' to move the snake and eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#  S   #\n#  H   #\n# A    #\n#AA    #\n########\n\n\nSince the current direction is DOWN, I will give the direction that will keep the snake moving downward without colliding with itself or the walls, and also try to eat an apple. The best direction in this case is DOWN.\n\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  S   #\n# AH   #\n#AA    #\n########\n\nTo determine the next move, I will analyze the current state of the board and the current direction of the snake.\n\nSince the current direction is 'DOWN' and there's an apple below the snake's head, moving down would cause the snake to eat the apple and increase the score.\n\nHowever, considering the position of the apples and the snake's body, moving down would also put the snake in a position where it might be difficult to navigate and potentially lead to a collision with itself or the walls in the future.\n\nGiven the current state of the board and the current direction, I will choose to move 'RIGHT', which is the only viable option that doesn't involve reversing the direction.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# ASH  #\n#AA    #\n########\n\n\nSince the current direction is 'RIGHT' and there is an 'A' to the right of the snake's head 'H', I will give the direction 'RIGHT' to eat the apple and increase the score.\n\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A SH #\n#AA    #\n########\n\nThe snake is moving right and there's an apple to the right of the snake. To eat the apple and grow in length, I'll continue moving right. However, since there's a wall at the end, the snake cannot reverse direction directly. So the best move would be to move down after eating the apple to avoid collision with the wall. But since I can only give one direction, my direction will be RIGHT for now.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A  SH#\n#AA    #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is RIGHT, the snake will continue to move to the right. However, the snake cannot reverse its direction, and moving right will cause the snake to collide with the wall. To avoid this, the snake should change its direction.\n\nConsidering the position of the apples, the best direction to move would be DOWN, as it would allow the snake to approach the apples.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A   S#\n#AA   H#\n########\n\nSince the snake is moving DOWN and the current head position is at the bottom left corner, it cannot move down anymore as it will hit the wall. Also, the snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'DOWN' to 'UP' directly). So, the snake should move either 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT'. In this case, moving 'LEFT' would cause the snake to eat the apple and increase the score, and also avoid hitting the wall.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#AA  HS#\n########\n\nBased on the current state of the board and the current direction 'LEFT', the next move will not eat an apple, and the snake will collide with the wall. To avoid the collision and have a chance to eat the apple, I should change the direction to 'UP'. \n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A  H #\n#AA  S #\n########\n\nSince the snake is moving 'UP' and there's no apple or obstacle directly above it, the best move would be to continue moving 'UP' to potentially get closer to the apples on the left side of the board.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    H #\n# A  S #\n#AA    #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is UP, the snake will move up. However, the snake's body is below it and moving up would cause a collision. Therefore, to avoid collision, we should change the direction to either LEFT or RIGHT. Since there is an apple to the left of the snake's head, I will choose LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   HS #\n# A    #\n#AA    #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is LEFT, the snake will move left. However, there's an apple to the left of the snake, so it will eat the apple and grow in length. \n\nTo move the snake to the left and eat the apple, the direction should be LEFT.\n\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  HS  #\n# A    #\n#AA    #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is LEFT and the snake's head is already on the leftmost part of its body, we can't move left without reversing the direction. The snake cannot reverse its direction, so we need to move either up or down to avoid collision with itself. Given the current position of the snake and the apples, moving down would not eat an apple, but moving up would put the snake in the same position. Since moving down doesn't eat an apple and moving up keeps the snake in the same position, the best move would be to move the snake up to avoid collision and possibly change direction later to eat an apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#  S   #\n# A    #\n#AA    #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is 'UP' and the snake's head 'H' cannot move further up without hitting the wall, and moving 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT' would not allow the snake to eat an apple, I will choose the direction 'LEFT' to avoid collision with the wall.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#      #\n# HS   #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#AA    #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is LEFT and the snake head 'H' is already on the leftmost part of the board occupied by its body 'S', we cannot move LEFT. If we do, the snake will collide with itself. So, to avoid collision, we will move the snake UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n# H    #\n# S    #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#AA    #\n########\n\nTo move the snake and eat the apple, the best direction is LEFT, however, there are no apples in this direction. If we move LEFT, we will just move the snake. If we move UP, we will hit the wall. If we move RIGHT, we will move closer to an apple and have a chance to eat it in the next moves. If we move DOWN, we will move away from an apple. Given the current position of the snake and the apples, and the fact that we cannot move the snake directly to the apple in one move, we have to move RIGHT, then DOWN to eat an apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n# SH   #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#AA    #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is RIGHT and there are no obstacles or apples directly to the right, I will keep moving in the same direction.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#  SH  #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#AA    #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is RIGHT and there is an apple at the right side of the snake, I will keep the direction as RIGHT to eat the apple and increase the score.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#   SH #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#AA    #\n########\n\nTo determine the next direction, we need to analyze the current state of the game board. Since the current direction is RIGHT and there is no wall or obstacle in that direction, we should continue moving RIGHT to maximize the chances of finding an apple and growing the snake's length.\n\nHowever, we should also consider the position of the apples on the board. There is an apple located at the bottom left of the board, which might require us to change direction to LEFT or DOWN in the future. But for now, we can continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#    SH#\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#AA    #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is RIGHT, I will give the direction that makes sense for the snake to keep moving and potentially eat an apple. Given the current direction is RIGHT, the snake can only turn UP or DOWN without reversing its direction.\n\nConsidering the snake's current position and the location of the apples, turning UP seems like the best option to get closer to the apples. \n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#     H#\n#     S#\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#AA    #\n########\n\n\nBased on the game board and rules, I will decide the direction for the snake.\n\n\nSince the snake is moving UP and there are no obstacles or apples in the way, the best direction to move is to keep moving UP, but the head is already at the top of the board, so moving UP would result in a collision with the wall. In this case, the best direction to move would be to move LEFT or RIGHT to avoid the collision. However, moving RIGHT does not provide any advantage as there is no apple in that direction, so I decide to move LEFT.\n\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#    HS#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#AA    #\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction to move the snake, I need to analyze the current state of the board and the direction the snake is currently moving.\n\nSince the snake is currently moving LEFT, and the head of the snake is next to its body, the snake cannot move LEFT anymore because it would collide with its own body. \n\nLooking at the board, I notice that there are apples below the snake, which would be a good target to move towards.\n\nConsidering these factors, the best direction to move the snake would be DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#    S #\n#    H #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#AA    #\n########\n\nThe current state of the board shows that the snake is moving downwards. To increase the score, the snake should move towards the apples. However, if the snake moves downwards, it will collide with the wall. Therefore, the snake should turn 'LEFT' to move towards the apples and increase the score.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#   HS #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#AA    #\n########\n\nSince the snake is currently moving LEFT and there is no wall or itself in the way, I will keep moving the snake to the LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#  HS  #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#AA    #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is 'LEFT' and the snake cannot reverse its direction, it can only move 'LEFT', 'UP', or 'DOWN'.

The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point.

Considering the snake's movement and the current game board layout, the best direction to give is 'DOWN'. \n\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#     A#\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#H     #\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe snake's current position is at the bottom left of the board with the head 'H' and it is moving in the 'DOWN' direction, but there is a wall below it. To avoid collision with the wall, I need to change the direction.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#     A#\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n# H    #\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving to the right, and its head is at the position marked 'H'. Since there are no obstacles or apples directly to the right of the snake's head, it will continue moving in the same direction. However, considering the position of the apples on the board, it would be beneficial to move the snake towards the closest apple. \n\nConsidering this, the best move would be to change the direction to UP to align with the closest apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n#     A#\n#      #\n# A    #\n# H    #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nTo determine the next move, I will analyze the current state of the board.

The snake is currently moving UP and there is an apple above it. However, moving up will cause the snake to collide with the wall. Therefore, I will choose a direction that allows the snake to continue moving and potentially eat an apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#     A#\n#      #\n# SH A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving to the right. To eat the apple and increase the score, I need to change the direction to DOWN, but since I can only give one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP', or 'DOWN' and the snake cannot reverse its direction, I will move the snake to the right to align it with the apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#     A#\n#      #\n#  SHA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#     A#\n#      #\n#   SA #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is DOWN, the next step would be to move the snake down. However, moving down would cause the snake to collide with the wall.\n\nConsidering the current state of the board, a safe move would be to move the snake to the RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#     A#\n#      #\n#    A #\n#   SH #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nTo determine the next direction, I will analyze the current state of the board and the direction the snake is moving.\n\nSince the snake is moving RIGHT and there's no obstacle or apple in the immediate right direction, the best course of action is to continue moving RIGHT to explore more of the board and potentially find more apples.\n\nHowever, I need to consider the position of the apples on the board. There's an apple above the snake and two more below. If I move RIGHT, I won't be able to reach the apple above. But if I move UP, I can reach the apple above and increase my score.\n\nConsidering the options, I decide to move UP to reach the apple above.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n# A   A#\n#      #\n#    H #\n#   SS #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is 'UP' and the snake's head is at position '#    H #' with an apple to its left and above it, but the snake cannot move left or right because it would reverse its direction. Also, the snake cannot move down because its body is below it. So the only safe direction to move the snake would be to continue moving it up. \n\nHowever, I should give one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN' as the answer, and give the answer in the required format.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n# A   A#\n#    H #\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is UP and the snake's head is already at the top of its body, moving up would cause the snake to collide with itself. The best direction to move would be LEFT or RIGHT, considering the current state of the board and the goal of eating apples. The snake can move LEFT to prepare for eating the apples on the left side of the board.\n\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n# A   A#\n#   HS #\n#    S #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nBased on the game board and the current direction, I will give my answer.\n\nSince the current direction is LEFT, the snake's head will move to the left. There is no wall or itself in the left direction, so the snake can move safely.\n\nHowever, I need to give a direction to control the snake. Considering the current state of the board, I think it's a good idea to keep moving LEFT to explore more of the board and potentially eat an apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n# A   A#\n#  HSS #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nAccording to the current game state, the snake will continue moving LEFT. Since there is no wall or itself in the way, the snake will move one square to the left.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n# A   A#\n# HSS  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\n\nSince the current direction is 'LEFT', and the snake head 'H' is at the leftmost position on the board, giving a 'LEFT' command will cause the snake to collide with the wall and lose the game. The best move would be to change the direction to 'UP', 'DOWN', or 'RIGHT'. However, considering the positions of the apples and the current snake direction, I would suggest moving the snake to the 'UP' direction to avoid collision with the wall and be in a better position to eat the apple above it. But since the snake head 'H' is at the leftmost position, moving 'UP' will not eat an apple and we have another choice. Considering the game rule, the snake cannot reverse its direction, we cannot give 'RIGHT' command. So we have only one choice 'DOWN' or 'UP'. Considering the position of the apple, I will give the 'DOWN' command to eat an apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n# A   A#\n# SS   #\n# H    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nMy analysis of the board shows the snake is currently moving DOWN and is near the bottom-left corner of the board, with an apple to its right. Considering the current direction, if the snake moves DOWN, it will collide with the wall. Also, moving LEFT would cause a collision with itself. Moving RIGHT is the only safe option which will allow the snake to eat the apple to its right.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n# A   A#\n# S    #\n# SH   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\n\nSince the current direction is RIGHT, the snake will continue to move in that direction. However, since the snake is already at the rightmost edge of the board and moving RIGHT would cause it to collide with the wall, I will change the direction to DOWN to avoid the collision.\n\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n# A   A#\n#      #\n# SS   #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is 'DOWN', the snake is moving down. However, moving down will cause the snake to collide with the wall of the board. So I will give a direction to change the snake's direction to avoid the collision.\n\nI will give the direction 'RIGHT'. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n# A   A#\n#      #\n#  S   #\n#  SH  #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nTo determine the next direction, I will analyze the current state of the board. The snake is currently moving RIGHT and there are no apples in its immediate path. However, there is an apple to the LEFT, but since the snake cannot reverse its direction, it cannot move LEFT directly.\n\nConsidering the current direction is RIGHT, I will give the direction: RIGHT","########\n# A   A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SSH #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\n\nI will make my move based on this board and the current direction. To avoid hitting the wall and to eat an apple, I will turn the snake to face the 'DOWN' direction. However, since the snake's current direction is 'RIGHT', the snake cannot reverse its direction directly and cannot turn 'UP' or 'LEFT'. So the only available direction is 'DOWN'. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n# A   A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SS #\n#    H #\n#A     #\n########\n\nIn order to eat the apple and increase the score, I should move the snake to the left. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n# A   A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#    S #\n#   HS #\n#A     #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is 'LEFT', the snake is moving to the left. However, the snake can't reverse its direction, so we need to provide a direction that is not the opposite of 'LEFT', which is 'RIGHT'. We can choose 'UP' or 'DOWN' as the next direction.\n\nConsidering the snake's current position and the location of the apples, moving 'UP' seems like a good option, as it will get the snake closer to the apples on the top-left side of the board.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n# A   A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#   H  #\n#   SS #\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe snake is moving up and will hit the wall if it continues in this direction. To avoid this, I will change the direction to LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n# A   A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#  HS  #\n#   S  #\n#A     #\n########\n\nSince the current direction is LEFT and the snake is moving left, it's better to change the direction to UP because moving left may lead to eating the apple and also moving left may lead to colliding with the wall of the board if we continue moving left. However, based on the current state of the board, moving up will not make us eat the apple but prevent us from colliding with the wall of the board.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n# A   A#\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#  SS  #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\n\nSince the current direction is UP, the snake will move up. To avoid hitting the wall, I will give the direction as LEFT.\n\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n# A   A#\n#      #\n# HS   #\n#  S   #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nSince the snake is currently moving LEFT and there's no wall or the snake's body directly to the left of the snake's head, the snake will continue moving left. However, the snake will collide with itself if it continues moving left, so we need to change the direction to avoid this.\n\nTo avoid colliding with itself and to continue eating the apples, the best direction would be to move UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","########\n# A   A#\n# H    #\n# SS   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nAccording to the game board and rules, I would give the direction 'LEFT' to control the snake.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n# A   A#\n#HS    #\n# S    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, I need to analyze the current state of the board and the snake's position. Since the current direction is LEFT, the snake cannot move RIGHT directly. The snake's head is currently at the second column, and moving LEFT would cause it to collide with the wall. Moving UP or DOWN would not result in an immediate collision or eating an apple.\n\nHowever, considering the overall goal of eating apples and growing the snake, moving DOWN would put the snake in a better position to potentially eat the apple in the bottom-left corner.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n# A   A#\n#SS    #\n#H     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nTo determine the next direction, I'll analyze the current state of the board. Since the snake is moving DOWN and there's an apple below the snake, I'll keep moving in the same direction to eat the apple and increase the score.\n\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n# A   A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, let's analyze the board. Since the current direction is 'DOWN' and there's an apple below the snake's head, moving down would be a good option. However, the snake cannot directly reverse its direction. Additionally, moving left or right would not lead to an immediate collision, but moving down would allow the snake to eat the apple and grow in length.\n\nConsidering these factors, the best direction would be to continue moving down to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n# A   A#\n#      #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#A     #\n########\n\nSince the snake is currently moving in the 'DOWN' direction and there is an apple in that direction, the best move would be to continue moving down to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n# A   A#\n#   A  #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#H     #\n########\n\nSince the snake's current direction is 'DOWN' and it has already reached the bottom of the board, the snake cannot move down anymore. It will collide with the wall if it continues moving down. To avoid this, I will change the direction to 'RIGHT'. However, 'RIGHT' will also make the snake collide with itself. Therefore, I will change the direction to 'UP' is also not possible as the snake will collide with itself.\n\nConsidering all possible directions, I will change the direction to 'LEFT' is not possible as the snake will collide with itself. Considering all possible directions, I will change the direction to 'RIGHT' is not possible as the snake will collide with itself.\n\nConsidering all possible directions, I will change the direction to 'UP' is not possible as the snake will collide with itself.

The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point.
