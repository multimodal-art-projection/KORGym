You are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format. The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER' (without quotes), where YOUR_ANSWER is your final answer to the question,e.g.'Answer: Hit'\nAt the start of the game, the dealer has one face-up card and one face-down card, while the player has two face-up cards. All cards are drawn from an infinite deck.\n\nCard values are as follows:\n\n- Aces are worth 1 point.\n- Number cards (2-10) are worth their numerical value.\n- Face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 11, 12, and 13 points, respectively.\n\nIn each round, the player can request an additional card (Hit) until they decide to stop (Stand) or exceed N. When both sides have stopped, the settlement occurs. If one side exceeds N and the other side does not, the side that did not exceed N wins, and the other side loses. If both sides exceed N, it is a draw. If neither side exceeds N, the side closest to N wins, and the other side loses. If both sides have the same total, it is a draw. Winning earns 1 score, a draw earns 0.5 score, and losing earns 0 score.\n\nYour goal is to achieve the highest possible score. In each round, you can choose either Hit or Stand as your action.\n\nNow the current game situations are as follows:\n\nN is 36.\nYour cards are ['4', '3', '2', '8', 'A'].\nDealer cards are ['K', 'unknown card', 'unknown card']. \nThe last step of dealer is Stand.\n\n\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=1.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=-1, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=14574, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None), prompt_token_ids: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.
