{"board":[["🐋","🐋","🚀","🐋"],["🚀","🌳","🌳","🚀"],["🌳","🦩","🚀","🌳"],["🚀","🦩","🦩","🚀"]],"response":["<think>\nOkay, so I've got this problem to solve where I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines on a rectangular board made up of emojis. The lines need to be made of the same emoji and have a length of two or more. Hmm, sounds a bit like solving a grid problem where I'm looking for consecutive same symbols either in rows or columns.\n\nFirst, I should probably start by looking at the board that's given. Let me write it out to visualize it better. The board is a 4x4 grid, right? So each row has four emojis. Let's see:\n\nRow 1: 🐋🐋🚀🐋\nRow 2: 🚀🌳🌳🚀\nRow 3: 🌳🦩🚀🌳\nRow 4: 🚀🦩🦩🚀\n\nWait, no, the rows are one after another. Let me make sure the rows are correct. It's four rows, each with four emojis. So I think I have the rows right.\n\nNow, I need to check each row for horizontal lines and each column for vertical lines. For each possible line of two or more same emojis, count it. But wait, are overlapping lines counted separately? Like, if a row has three same emojis, does that count as two lines (the two possible pairs and the trio) or just one trio and one pair? Or perhaps each consecutive same sequence is considered once. Hmm, the problem statement says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So, I think each maximal sequence counts as a single line. Or wait, perhaps it's every possible pair or longer. But that would complicate it, maybe the problem considers a stretch of n same emojis as one line. Hmm, no, let me think again.\n\nWait, the question says \"lines formed by same emoji with length of 2 or more.\" So, each maximal consecutive sequence (horizontal or vertical) of two or more same emojis counts as one line. So if I have a run of 3 same emojis, it's one line, right? Like, if there are three 'a's in a row, that's one line of length 3, not counting as two lines of length 2 each.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So, I think each maximal stretch counts as one line. For example, a row in the first row (row 1) starts with 🐋🐋, so that's a line of length 2. Then there's a 🚀, and then a 🐋 at the end. So in row one, the first two 🐋s count as a line. So that's one line.\n\nIn row one: 🐋🐋 is one line (length 2), which counts as one. The last 🐋 is alone, so no line.\n\nSo, let me go step by step.\n\nLet me structure this.\n\nFirst, process the rows for horizontal lines. For each row, scan each position, check for consecutive runs of same emojis.\n\nSimilarly, process the columns for vertical lines.\n\nThen, sum all these horizontal and vertical lines.\n\nLet's start with horizontal.\n\nRow 1: 🐋, 🐋, 🚀, 🐋.\n\nSo, positions 0 and 1 are 🐋. So, that's a run of 2. So count 1.\n\nRow 2: 🚀, 🌳, 🌳, 🚀.\n\nHere, positions 1 and 2 are 🌳s. So a run of 2. Count 1.\n\nRow 3: 🌳, 🦩, 🚀, 🌳.\n\nNo two same emojis in a row. Each emoji is different from its next. So, no lines here.\n\nRow 4: 🚀, 🦩, 🦩, 🚀.\n\nPositions 1 and 2: 🦩🦩. So a run of 2. Count 1.\n\nSo, total horizontal lines: 1 (row1) +1 (row2)+ 0 (row3) +1 (row4) = 3.\n\nWait, wait. No, wait, row 4 doesn't have 🐋s. Let me see row 4 again. Row4 is 🚀, 🦩, 🦩, 🚀. So, the two 🦩's are in positions 1 and 2 (if rows are 0-indexed?), so that's one line. So yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but rows are four elements each. Let me count each row's runs.\n\nSo horizontal lines: 3 in total.\n\nNow, let's move to vertical lines. I need to check each column for consecutive same emojis.\n\nThere are four columns since it's a 4x4 grid.\n\nColumn 1: let me index columns from 0 to 3.\n\nColumn 0: 🐋, 🚀, 🌳, 🚀.\n\nSo the emojis are:\n\nRow 0: 🐋\n\nRow1: 🚀\n\nRow2: 🌳\n\nRow3: 🚀\n\nSo, no two same in a row. Therefore, no lines in column 0.\n\nColumn1: 🐋, 🌳, 🦩, 🦩.\n\nRow0: 🐋\n\nRow1: 🌳\n\nRow2: 🦩\n\nRow3: 🦩\n\nLooking for vertical runs here. So row2 and row3 are 🦩 and 🦩. So that's a run of 2. So count 1 for column1.\n\nColumn2: 🚀, 🌳, 🚀, 🦩.\n\nSo:\n\nRow0: 🚀\n\nRow1: 🌳\n\nRow2: 🚀\n\nRow3: 🦩\n\nSo, are any two same consecutively? Let's see.\n\nRow0 is 🚀, row1 is 🌳 (different), row1 to row2: 🌳 to 🚀 (diff), row2 to row3: 🚀 to 🦩 (diff). So, no runs here.\n\nSo, column2 has no lines.\n\nColumn3: 🐋, 🚀, 🌳, 🚀.\n\nSo:\n\nRow0: 🐋\n\nRow1: 🚀\n\nRow2: 🌳\n\nRow3: 🚀\n\nNo two same in a row. So no lines in column3.\n\nThus, vertical lines: only 1 from column1.\n\nWait wait, wait. Let me double-check column1.\n\nColumn1 is indexed as the second column? Let me see.\n\nEach row:\n\nRow0: index 0: 🐋, index1: 🐋 (row0 is the first row: 🐋🐋🚀🐋. So the columns are:\n\nColumn0: 🐋 (row0), 🚀 (row1), 🌳 (row2), 🚀 (row3).\n\nColumn1: 🐋 (row0), 🌳 (row1), 🦩 (row2), 🦩 (row3).\n\nWait, wait, no. Each column should consist of the same index from each row.\n\nSo, for column0: take index 0 from each row.\n\nRow0 index0: 🐋\n\nRow1 index0: 🚀\n\nRow2 index0: 🌳\n\nRow3 index0: 🚀\n\nSo, column0 is [🐋, 🚀, 🌳, 🚀] → no vertical runs.\n\nColumn1: each row's index1.\n\nRow0: index1 is 🐋.\n\nRow1: index1 is 🌳.\n\nRow2: index1 is 🦩.\n\nRow3: index1 is 🦩.\n\nSo column1 is [🐋, 🌳, 🦩, 🦩].\n\nLooking for consecutive duplicates.\n\nRow2 and row3 are 🦩, so that's a run of 2. So yes, count 1.\n\nWhat about other columns?\n\nColumn2: each row's index2.\n\nRow0: index2 is 🚀.\n\nRow1: index2 is 🌳.\n\nRow2: index2 is 🚀.\n\nRow3: index3 can't be— wait, index2 is the third emoji in each row.\n\nRow0: index2 is 🚀.\n\nRow1: index2 is 🌳.\n\nRow2: index2 is 🚀.\n\nRow3: index2 is 🦩.\n\nSo column2 is [🚀, 🌳, 🚀, 🦩]. Check for runs— does any two same emotes come one after the other?\n\n1st and 2nd: 🚀→🌳 no. 2nd→3rd: 🌳→🚀 no. 3rd→4th: 🚀→🦩 no. So, no lines.\n\nColumn3: each row's index3.\n\nRow0: 🐋.\n\nRow1: 🚀.\n\nRow2: 🌳.\n\nRow3: 🚀.\n\nSo column3 is [🐋, 🚀, 🌳, 🚀].\n\nCheck for consecutive duplicate: row3's index3 is 🚀, row2's is 🌳 (no), row1's is 🚀 and row2's 🌳 is different, etc. So no vertical runs except for column1.\n\nSo vertical lines: 1.\n\nNow, that's the vertical counts. So total lines so far: 3 (horizontal) +1 (vertical) =4.\n\nWait... is that all? Or did I miss any other lines?\n\nWait, maybe I should look more carefully. Let's re-examine each row for any possible runs I might have missed.\n\nRow1: 🐋, 🐋, 🚀, 🐋. So first two are a run, then the last is single. So one line.\n\nRow2: 🚀, 🌳, 🌳, 🚀. So positions1 and 2 are the same, so run of two → 1 line.\n\nRow3: 🌳, 🦩, 🚀, 🌳. No runs. Correct.\n\nRow4: 🚀, 🦩, 🦩, 🚀. Run in positions1 and2 → 1 line. So sum 3 horizontal, 1 vertical.\n\nWait, but what about any vertical lines longer than 2? Well, our column1 has a run of 2, which is counted, same as runs longer would count only once. So no, we don't have any longer runs. For instance, are any columns with three same emojis?\n\nLooking again at column0: 🐋, 🚀, 🌳, 🚀. Only the last two are same but they are rows 3 and 3 has 🚀, and row2 is 🌳 → so no, only column1 has a run of two.\n\nSo thinking that, the total should be 3+1=4.\n\nWait, let me think again. Did I miss any horizontal run?\n\nWait, for example, row1: 🐋🐋, which is two, so yes. Row2: 🌳🌳, which is a run, 2. Row4: 🦩🦩, 2. So that's three. What about in row2, 🌳, 🌳. So okay. So horizontal sum is 3 as per earlier.\n\nWait, for vertical, the only run is in column1, between row2 and row3: 🦩🦩.\n\nSo that's right.\n\nBut I should also check columns beyond these details. Let me take each column one by one.\n\nColumn0:\nRow0: 🐋\nRow1: 🚀\nRow2: 🌳\nRow3: 🚀\nNo same consecutive emojis except row1 and row3 are separated by two rows, so no run.\n\nColumn1:\nrow0 🐋 → row1 🌳 (diff)\nrow1 🌳 → row2 🦩 (diff)\nrow2 🦩 → row3 🦩 (same). So run of two at the end. So that's 1.\n\nColumn2: 🚀, 🌳, 🚀, 🦩.\nNo consecutive same emojis.\n\nColumn3:\nrow0 🐋, row1 🚀, row2 🌳, row3 🚀.\nNo consecutive runs.\n\nSo vertical lines sum to 1.\n\nThus, 3+1=4. But wait, the sample inputs don't have such a scenario. Wait, am I considering diagonal lines? Or just horizontal and vertical.\n\nProblem statement says, 'horizontal or vertical lines', nothing about diagonals. So no.\n\nBut let me re-examine each row, perhaps I missed a horizontal run.\n\nRow1: 🐋 🐋 🚀 🐋 → first two are same, that's a run of two. So one.\n\nRow2: 🚀🌳🌳🚀 → middle two same, run of two. So one.\n\nRow3: 🌳🦩🚀🌳 → all different. So no.\n\nRow4: 🚀🦩🦩🚀 → two in the middle: run of two. So one.\n\nSo that 3 in horizontal.\n\nSo is the total 3+1=4?\n\nWait, but when I looked at row4, it's two in positions 1 and 2. So that's another line, yes.\n\nHmm, but according to this, the answer would be 4?\n\nWait, let me make sure that I didn't overlook any possibilities, especially in the columns. Because perhaps there are longer runs that I didn't count. But no.\n\nAs an alternative approach, perhaps I should list all lines.\n\nHorizontal:\n\n1. Row0: run from column0 to column1 (🐋🐋)\n2. Row1: run from column1 to column2 (🌳🌳)\n3. Row3: run from column1 to column2 🦩🦩.\n\nBut Wait, the rows are 0-indexed (row1 is row index 0?), or maybe I'm mixing up the rows.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the rows mixed up.\n\nLet me clarify.\n\nThe board is given as:\n\nLine1: 🐋🐋🚀🐋 → row 0?\n\nLine2: 🚀🌳🌳🚀 → row1?\n\nLine3: 🌳🦩🚀🌳 →row2?\n\nLine4: 🚀🦩🦩🚀 →row3.\n\nSo, horizontal runs:\n\nRow0: 🐋🐋 → positions 0-1 → count 1.\n\nRow1: 🌳🌳 → positions 1-2 → count 1.\n\nRow3: 🦩🦩 → positions1-2 → count 1.\n\nSo yes that's three.\n\nVertical runs:\n\nOnly between row2 (row index2) column1 '🦩' and row3 column1 '🦩' → which is in column1, positions2 and3 → count1.\n\nSo total is 3+1=4, answer is 4.\n\nBut wait, are there any vertical runs longer than two? No, because each vertical run is exactly two.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm being instructed to count each possible line of two or more, which includes any possible run of two, even if it's part of a longer run. For example, if a column has three same emojis, like a, a, a. So the runs would be: positions0-1 (length 2), positions1-2 (length2), and positions0-2 (length3). But wait, in that case, would longer runs count multiple times?\n\nBut this complicates the problem. Hence, the standard approach is to count each maximal sequence as a single line.\n\nWait, suppose in column1: we have a run of two. So count 1. But if in another case, a column has three same, like [🎭, 🎭, 🎭, 🎯], that's a single run of three, so it's counted as one line, not two or three.\n\nThus, in our current case, all runs are of length two, and each is a single line.\n\nSo, wrapping up, total lines are 3 (horizontal) +1 (vertical) =4.\n\nWait, but wait another possibility: maybe I need to check for both of directions and some cells are part of both a horizontal and a vertical line. But that doesn't affect counting, each line is counted once, regardless of direction.\n\nSo the final answer is 4? Or am I missing something.\n\nWait, let me recount all the runs I found.\n\nHorizontal:\n\nRow0: run of two 🐋 → count1.\n\nRow1: run of two 🌳 → count1.\n\nRow2: no runs.\n\nRow3: run of two 🦩 → count1.\n\nVertical:\n\nColumn1: run of two 🦩 → count1.\n\nTotal: 4.\n\nHmm. Ok.\n\nBut let's verify the board:\n\nRow1: 🐋🐋 | 🚀 | 🐋 → one horizontal line.\n\nRow2: 🚀 | 🌳🌳 | 🚀 → one horizontal line.\n\nRow3: 🌳 | 🦩 | 🚀 | 🌳 → no line.\n\nRow4: 🚀 | 🦩🦩 | 🚀 → one horizontal line.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn0: 🐋, 🚀, 🌳, 🚀 → so 🚀 is at row3, but row3 is at the end. So consecutive rows are row1 (🚀) and row3 (🚀), but no, they are separated by row2 (🌳), so no run.\n\nColumn1: 🐋 (row0), 🌳 (row1), 🦩 (row2), 🦩 (row3). So rows 2 and 3 have 🦩🦩 → that's one vertical line.\n\nThus, 3 horizontal, 1 vertical, 4 in total.\n\nSo the answer should be 4.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit uncertain. Maybe I should represent each row and column and mark the lines.\n\nAnother approach: create a table of the board.\n\nLet me list the board as a 4x4 grid using indices (row, column) starting from (0,0) to (3,3).\n\nRow 0: 🐋 (0,0), 🐋 (0,1), 🚀 (0,2), 🐋 (0,3).\n\nRow1: 🚀 (1,0), 🌳 (1,1), 🌳 (1,2), 🚀 (1,3).\n\nRow2: 🌳 (2,0), 🦩 (2,1), 🚀 (2,2), 🌳 (2,3).\n\nRow3: 🚀 (3,0), 🦩 (3,1), 🦩 (3,2), 🚀 (3,3).\n\nNow, for each row:\n\nRow0: 0,0 and 0,1: same. So one line.\n\nRow1: 1,1 and 1,2: same, one line.\n\nRow2: No consecutive duplicates.\n\nRow3: 3,1 and 3,2: same, one line.\n\nSo that's 3 horizontal lines.\n\nFor vertical:\n\nCheck each column:\n\nColumn0:\n\n(0,0)=🐋, (1,0)=🚀, (2,0)=🌳, (3,0)=🚀.\n\nLook for consecutive same in column0: no.\n\nColumn1:\n\n(0,1)=🐋\n\n(1,1)=🌳\n\n(2,1)=🦩\n\n(3,1)=🦩.\n\nCheck row2 and row3: same 🦩.\n\nSo one line here.\n\nColumn2:\n\n(0,2)=🚀\n\n(1,2)=🌳\n\n(2,2)=🚀\n\n(3,2)=🦩.\n\nNo consecutive duplicates.\n\nColumn3:\n\n(0,3)=🐋\n\n(1,3)=🚀\n\n(2,3)= 🌳\n\n(3,3)=🚀.\n\nNo consecutive duplicates.\n\nThus, only one vertical line.\n\nSo total lines: 3+1=4.\n\nSo, answer must be 4.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal and vertical lines formed by the same emoji on a 4x4 grid, where each line has a length of 2 or more.

{"board":[["🦅","🐳","🐳","🐳"],["🐳","🌞","🦅","🐳"],["🦅","🐳","🐳","🦅"],["🐳","🐰","🌞","🦅"]],"response":["<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to solve this problem. Let's see what it's about. The task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines on a rectangular emoji board. These lines are formed by the same emoji and have a length of 2 or more. So, I need to look through each row and column and check for consecutive emojis that are the same, and if their length is at least two.\n\nFirst, I'll start by visualizing the board. The board is given as:\n\nRow 1: 🦅 🐳 🐳 🐳\nRow 2: 🐳 🌞 🦅 🐳\nRow 3: 🦅 🐳 🐳 🦅\nRow 4: 🐳 🐰 🌞 🦅\n\nWait, maybe I should write it down clearly, as a grid. So maybe each row is:\n\nRow 0: 🦅, 🐳, 🐳, 🐳\nRow 1: 🐳, 🌞, 🦅, 🐳\nRow 2: 🦅, 🐳, 🐳, 🦅\nRow 3: 🐳, 🐰, 🌞, 🦅\n\nWait, maybe numbering them as rows 1 through 4 is easier.\n\nI think I should process each row first for horizontal lines, and then each column for vertical lines.\n\nFor horizontal lines, for each row, check consecutive emojis. For example, in row 1, the first emoji is 🦅. The next is 🐳, which is different, so no line. Then from 🐳, the next two are also 🐳, so that's a line of length 3.\n\nWait no, the line requires at least 2. But perhaps I should count each possible consecutive sequence in a row.\n\nWait, so for a given row, for each position, how long is the consecutive sequence starting from there. For each such sequence of length >=2, it adds to the count. But wait, when there's longer sequences, like 3, that might include two separate groups that should be counted. Hmm, perhaps for a sequence of n, it contributes n-1 to the count. Because a sequence of 3 would have two lines of 2, but I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, no, the problem says to count the number of lines. So, a line is any maximal run of the same emoji with length >=2. So for a run of 3 same emojis, there's one line of length 3, so it adds 1 to the count. Wait wait, no. Wait, the question is to count each maximal run once, regardless of how long it is. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\n\"The number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\"\n\nSo each maximal run of same emojis with length >=2 counts as one line. So for a row like 🐳🐳🐳, that's one line of length 3, not two (since lines are at least 2). Because each such run is one line.\n\nSo in the horizontal example of Row1: 🦅 🐳 🐳 🐳, the run of 3 🐳 in the middle is one line.\n\nFor the vertical lines, same approach. For each column, check each possible consecutive run. But wait, when checking vertically, it's across rows but same column. So for column 1, the emojis are 🐳, 🌞, 🐳, 🐰 -- no runs. Column 2: 🐳, 🦅, 🐳, 🌞? Maybe I should check each column.\n\nOkay, so I'll process each row for horizontal lines and each column for vertical lines.\n\nLet's process each row:\n\nRow 1: 🦅, 🐳, 🐳, 🐳\n- There's a run starting at position 1 (index 0 perhaps?), let me count from index 1 (1-based or 0-based). Let's just see, there's 3 in a row. So that's one horizontal line.\n\nRow 2: 🐳, 🌞, 🦅, 🐳\n- All have single emojis, so no horizontal runs.\n\nRow 3: 🦅, 🐳, 🐳, 🦅\n- The middle two 🐳 (indices 1 and 2) form a run of 2, so another horizontal line.\n\nRow 4: 🐳, 🐰, 🌞, 🦅\n- All single, no runs.\n\nSo horizontal lines total: 2 (from Row1 and Row3).\n\nNow vertical lines. Let's process each column:\n\nColumn 1: 🦅, 🐳, 🦅, 🐳\nLooking for consecutive same emojis.\n\nThe first element is 🦅 (row1). Next is 🐳 (row2): doesn't match. Then row3 is 🦅; same as row1? But the next row is 🐳, same as row2? Hmmm.\n\nWait, the first column is: Row1:🦅, Row2:🐳, Row3:🦅, Row4:🐳.\n\nSo no two same in a row, so no vertical lines here.\n\nColumn 2: 🐳, 🌞, 🐳, 🐰\nSo values are 🐳 (row1), 🌞 (row2), 🐳 (row3), 🐰 (row4). Let's see, any consecutive runs?\n\nRow1 and row3 are 🐳 but not consecutive. So only single occurrences between other emojis; no two in a row. So no vertical line here.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, perhaps I am getting the rows wrong. Each row is processed as a list, so row indices are 0 to 3.\n\nWait, perhaps column 0: row0 is 🦅, row1 is 🐳, row2 is 🦅, row3 is 🐳.\n\nCheck row0 and row1: 🦅 vs 🐳: different.\n\nRow1 and row2: 🐳 vs 🦅: different.\n\nRow2 and row3: 🦅 vs 🐳: different. So no vertical runs here.\n\nNext, column1:\n\nWait wait, no column1 isn't it that. Let me clarify:\n\nLet me reindex the columns as 0,1,2,3.\n\nLooking at each column:\n\nColumn 0: row0=🦅, row1=🐳, row2=🦅, row3=🐳.\n\nCheck for consecutive same:\n\nRow0 != row1.\n\nRow1!=row2.\n\nRow2!=row3. So no vertical runs.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nrow0=🐳, row1=🌞, row2=🐳, row3=🐰.\n\nNo consecutive duplicates. So no runs.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nrow0=🐳, row1=🦅, row2=🐳, row3=🌞.\n\nCheck consecutive: in column2:\n\nrow0=🐳, row1=🦅: no.\n\nRow1=🦅, row2=🐳: no.\n\nRow2=🐳, row3=🌞: no. So no runs.\n\nColumn3:\n\nrow0=🐳, row1=🐳, row2=🦅, row3=🦅.\n\nCheck for consecutive:\n\nRow0 (🐳) and row1 (🐳): same, so that's a run of 2. So that's one vertical line.\n\nAlso, row1 (🐳) is in a run here of 2.\n\nThen, row2 (🦅), row3 (🦅): another run of 2, so that's another one.\n\nWait, so column3 has two vertical runs.\n\nSo for column3:\n\nBetween row0 and row1: same, 2-length run. So count +=1.\n\nBetween row2 and row3: same, 2-length run. So count +=1.\n\nSo for vertical lines, from column3 we have two lines.\n\nThis brings the total vertical lines to 2.\n\nWait, are there any other columns with runs? Let me check.\n\nYes, column 3 has two runs, each of length 2.\n\nSo vertical lines is 2.\n\nWait, what about column 2 in row0 and row2, which are 🐳, but they are not consecutive. So column2 has row0 🐳, row1 🦅, row2 🐳. So row0 and row2 are same but they're not consecutive, so they don't form a vertical line.\n\nSo, total lines: horizontal is 2, vertical is 2. So overall 4?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and there's another line somewhere.\n\nWait, checking the rows:\n\nRow0: 🦅🐳🐳🐳 → 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow1: 🐳🌞🦅🐳 → no lines.\n\nRow2: 🦅🐳🐳🦅 → 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow3: 🐳🐰🌞🦅 → no lines.\n\nSo horizontal lines: 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nVertical lines:\n\nLet me check each column again.\n\nColumn0:\n\nrow0: 🦅\nrow1: 🐳\nrow2: 🦅\nrow3: 🐳\n\nNo two in a row.\n\nColumn1:\n\nrow0: 🐳\nrow1: 🌞\nrow2: 🐳\nrow3: 🐰\n\nNo runs.\n\nColumn2:\n\nrow0: 🐳\nrow1: 🦅\nrow2: 🐳\nrow3: 🌞\n\nNo runs.\n\nColumn3:\n\nrow0: 🐳\nrow1: 🐳 → same as row0, run of 2.\n\nrow2: 🦅\nrow3: 🦅 → same as row2, run of 2.\n\nSo yes, vertical lines here for row0-1 and row2-3.\n\nSo that's two vertical lines.\n\nWait, any other columns? Let's check column1 again.\n\nColumn1 has row0:🐳, row1: 🌞 🦅, no.\n\nWait, row2: 🐳 and row3: 🐰: no run.\n\nSo vertical lines sum to 2.\n\nSo total lines: 2+2 = 4.\n\nWait wait, is that correct? Let me make sure.\n\nBut wait another look: column3:\n\nrow0:🐳, row1:🐳 → run of length 2.\n\nrow2:🦅, row3:🦅 → run of length 2. So that's two runs, each of length 2. So two vertical lines.\n\nYes.\n\nBut perhaps I've misprocessed some columns.\n\nWait: looking back.\n\nSo in row3, column0 is 🐳, row3: in column 0 is 🐳, row2 in col0 is 🦅. So no, nothing.\n\nWait, any other columns with runs? Hmm.\n\nWhat about column2, checking vertically:\n\nBetween row0's 🐳 and row2's 🐳 → but they're separated by row1's 🦅. So no consecutive runs.\n\nOk, so that's all.\n\nSo total lines 2+2=4?\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nWait the original grid:\n\nRow1: 🦅 🐳 🐳 🐳 → this row has a run of 3 → count 1 line.\n\nRow3: 🦅 🐳 🐳 🦅 → has a run of 2 → count 1 line.\n\nSo horizontal lines: 2.\n\nVertical lines:\n\nLooking at column3's four rows:\n\nRow1: 🐳\n\nRow2: 🐳 → same as Row1 → count 1.\n\nRow3: 🦅\n\nRow4: 🦅 → same as Row3 → count 1.\n\nSo vertical lines: 2.\n\nTotal lines overall: 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nWait, that's less than the initial assessment. So the answer would be 4?\n\nWait but looking at the description again to make sure about vertical lines.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the columns earlier.\n\nWait column2:\n\nWait the emojis are: row0:🐳, row1:🦅, row2:🐳, row3:🌞.\n\nSo row0 to row1: different.\n\nRow1 to row2: 🦅->🐳: different.\n\nRow2 to row3:🐳->🌞: different.\n\nSo no runs.\n\nWhat about column3:\n\nrow0:🐳, row1:🐳 → same. So that's a run.\n\nRow1 is 🐳 and row2 is 🦅: different.\n\nRow2 is 🦅, row3 is 🦅: same → another run.\n\nSo, that's two vertical lines.\n\nAre there any other runs elsewhere?\n\nPerhaps I should process each column again.\n\nLet me represent the grid as a matrix, maybe, to see it clearly.\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: 🦅, 🐳, 🐳, 🐳\n\nRow 1: 🐳, 🌞, 🦅, 🐳\n\nRow 2: 🦅, 🐳, 🐳, 🦅\n\nRow 3: 🐳, 🐰, 🌞, 🦅\n\nSo each row corresponds to, well, indexes 0-3 in rows and columns 0-3.\n\nSo,\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow0: 🦅\n\nRow1: 🐳\n\nRow2: 🦅\n\nRow3: 🐳\n\nSo pattern: 🦅, 🐳, 🦅, 🐳 → no consecutive duplicates.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow0: 🐳\n\nRow1: 🌞\n\nRow2: 🐳\n\nRow3: 🐰\n\nPattern: 🐳, 🌞, 🐳, 🐰 → no runs.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: 🐳\n\nRow1: 🦅\n\nRow2: 🐳\n\nRow3: 🌞\n\nPattern: 🐳, 🦅, 🐳, 🌞 → no consecutive duplicates.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🐳\n\nRow1: 🐳\n\nRow2: 🦅\n\nRow3: 🦅\n\nSo, as above, column3 has two runs.\n\nSo that's two vertical lines.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I'm missing a vertical line somewhere else.\n\nWait, looking at column0: perhaps between row2 and row0?\n\nNo, because they're not consecutive.\n\nOk, perhaps another approach: Iterate through each cell, looking for consecutive same below, or to the right.\n\nBut perhaps that'd be more thorough.\n\nAlternatively, think of horizontal lines as runs in the row, vertical as in the column.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to process each row and then each column.\n\nSo for each row, count the number of runs of same emojis, length≥2.\n\nRow0: '🦅','🐳','🐳','🐳'\n\nHere, the first element is 🦅, next is 🐳— different. Then, starting at position1, we have 🐳🐳🐳. So that's one run.\n\nSo count +=1.\n\nRow1: 🐳, 🌞, 🦅, 🐳\n\nNo consecutive same.\n\nRow2: 🦅, 🐳, 🐳, 🦅\n\nAt position1: 🐳🐳 → that's a run of length 2, so count +=1.\n\nRow3: 🐳, 🐰, 🌞, 🦅 → no runs.\n\nSo total horizontal lines:1+1=2.\n\nNow for vertical runs. For each column, look for runs of >=2 in length.\n\nColumn0.\n\nValues: 🦅, 🐳, 🦅, 🐳.\n\nCheck row0 to row1: 🦅 vs 🐳: different.\n\nRow1→row2: 🐳 → 🦅: different.\n\nRow2→row3: 🦅→🐳: different.\n\nNo runs.\n\nColumn1.\n\nValues: 🐳, 🌞, 🐳, 🐰.\n\nNo runs.\n\nColumn2.\n\nValues: 🐳, 🦅, 🐳, 🌞.\n\nChecking each row to row1, row2, etc.\n\nNo runs.\n\nColumn3.\n\nValues: 🐳, 🐳, 🦅, 🦅.\n\nAt row0→row1: same 🐳, run of 2. So count +=1.\n\nAt row1→row2: 🐳 → 🦅: no.\n\nAt row2→row3: 🦅 → 🦅: same, run of 2. So count +=1.\n\nSo vertical runs: 2.\n\nTotal lines: 2+2=4.\n\nBut wait, let me recheck all rows and columns again.\n\nMaybe there are some other runs I've missed.\n\nWhen processing vertical runs, for each column, we can go through each row:\n\nFor column3:\n\nCheck row0 and row1: same → count as one run.\n\nThen row1 and row2: different.\n\nRow2 and row3: same → another run.\n\nThus, two runs.\n\nSo, vertical lines:2, horizontal:2.\n\nWhat about rows?\n\nAnother approach: perhaps there are other vertical runs I've missed. Let's think.\n\nLooking at column3, it's 🐳 🐳 🦅 🦅 → so two runs, each length two.\n\nOther columns: no.\n\nSo that's handled.\n\nSo in total, 4 lines.\n\nHmm, then the answer is 4.\n\nBut wait from the initial user message, did I get the exact board right?\n\nAnother thing: perhaps the board provided is 4x4; each row is four emojis.\n\nLooking back, user's board is:\n\n🦅🐳🐳🐳\n🐳🌞🦅🐳\n🦅🐳🐳🦅\n🐳🐰🌞🦅\n\nWait each row is exactly four emojis, so yeah, it's a 4x4 grid.\n\nWait processing the rows again:\n\nRow0: 🦅 🐳 🐳 🐳 → run of 3 → 1 line.\n\nRow1: 🐳 🌞 🦅 🐳 → no runs.\n\nRow2: 🦅 🐳 🐳 🦅 → run of 2 at positions1-2 → 1 line.\n\nRow3: 🐳 🐰 🌞 🦅 → no runs.\n\nSo 2 horizontal.\n\nVertical: each column:\n\nColumn0:\n\nrow0=🦅, row1=🐳, row2=🦅, row3=🐳.\n\nCheck between rows:\n\n0-1:🦅 vs 🐳 → no.\n\n1-2: 🐳 vs 🦅 → no.\n\n2-3: 🦅 vs 🐳 → no. So no runs.\n\nColumn1:\n\nrow0=🐳, row1= 🌞, row2=🐳, row3=🐰 → no runs.\n\nColumn2:\n\nrow0=🐳, row1=🦅, row2=🐳, row3=🌞 → No.\n\nColumn3:\n\nrow0=🐳, row1= 🐳 → same → one run.\n\nrow2=🦅, row3=🦅 → same → another run.\n\nSo, two runs.\n\nThus, vertical lines: 2.\n\nTotal:2+2=4.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.

{"board":[["🐮","🐯","🐯","🐮"],["🐭","🐮","🐈","🐈"],["🐯","🐈","🐯","🐭"],["🐭","🐯","🐈","🐯"]],"response":["<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve this problem where I have a board made up of emojis, and I have to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, each line being two or longer. Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the board provided. It's a 4x4 grid. Each cell has an emoji, and I need to check each row and column for consecutive same emojis.\n\nLet me try to write down the grid to visualize it better. The board is:\n\nRow 0: 🐮 🐯 🐯 🐮\nRow 1: 🐭 🐮 🐈 🐈\nRow 2: 🐯 🐈 🐯 🐭\nRow 3: 🐭 🐯 🐈 🐯\n\nSo, I need to check each row for runs (horizontal lines) of the same emoji with length >=2, and each column for runs (vertical lines) similarly.\n\nLet me tackle horizontal lines first for each row.\n\nStarting with Row 0: 🐮 🐯 🐯 🐮\nLooking at each possible run:\n- 🐮 is alone, no line.\n- Next two are 🐯🐯, which is a run of 2. That's one line.\n- Then 🐮, alone.\nSo row 0 contributes 1.\n\nRow 1: 🐭 🐮 🐈 🐈\nCheck for runs:\n- 🐭 alone.\n- 🐮 alone.\n- 🐈🐈, run of 2. So another line. So row 1 adds 1.\n\nRow 2: 🐯 🐈 🐯 🐭\nEach emoji is different from the next, right? Let me check:\n- 🐯 followed by 🐈, no.\n- 🐈 followed by 🐯, no.\n- 🐯 followed by 🐭, no. So row 2 has no horizontal lines.\n\nRow 3: 🐭 🐯 🐈 🐯\nAgain, each is different from neighbors. None contribute.\n\nSo total horizontal lines so far: 1 (row0) + 1 (row1) = 2.\n\nNow, let me check the vertical lines by examining each column.\n\nColumns are 0,1,2,3.\n\nColumn 0:\nRow0: 🐮\nRow1: 🐭\nRow2: 🐯\nRow3: 🐭\nCheck for consecutive same. First, row0 is 🐮, row1 is 🐭; different. Then row2 🐯, row3 🐭—also different. No vertical lines here.\n\nColumn 1:\nRow0: 🐯\nRow1: 🐮\nRow2: 🐈\nRow3: 🐯\nLooking for runs. Let's see:\n\nBetween row0 and row1: 🐯 vs 🐮 no.\nRow1 (🐮) and row2 (🐈): no.\nRow2 and row3 (🐈 vs 🐯): no. So no vertical lines here.\n\nWait, is that right? Wait, column 1's emojis are 🐯, 🐮, 🐈, 🐯. No consecutive duplicates. So no lines.\n\nColumn 2:\nRow0: 🐯\nRow1: 🐈\nRow2: 🐯\nRow3: 🐈\nLooking for same in a row, vertically.\n\nRow0 (🐯) and row1 (🐈): no.\nRow1 and row2: 🐈 vs 🐯: no.\nRow2 (🐯) and row3 (🐈): no. So nothing here.\n\nColumn 3:\nRow0: 🐮\nRow1: 🐈\nRow2: 🐭\nRow3: 🐯\nCheck for consecutive duplicates: \n\nRow0 (🐮) and row1 (🐈): nope.\nRow1 (🐈) and row2 (🐭): no.\nRow2 (🐭) and row3 (🐯): no. So column 3 yields nothing.\n\nWait, wait a second—did I miss any column runs? Let me double-check the columns.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake looking at the data. Let me re-express the columns.\n\nLet me write each column as a list to get it right.\n\nColumn 0: row0=🐮, row1=🐭, row2=🐯, row3=🐭\nCheck in order:\n- Between row0 and row1: 🐮 vs 🐭 → different. No.\n- row1 and row2: 🐭 vs 🐯 → different. No.\n- row2 and row3: 🐯 vs 🐭 → different. So no vertical runs.\n\nColumn1: row0=🐯, row1=🐮, row2=🐈, row3=🐯\n- row0 to row1: 🐯≠🐮 → no.\n- row1 to row2: 🐮≠🐈 → no.\n- row2 to row3: 🐈≠🐯 → no. So nothing.\n\nColumn2: row0=🐯, row1=🐈, row2=🐯, row3=🐈.\n- row0 to row1: 🐯 vs 🐈 → no.\n- row1 to row2: 🐈 vs 🐯 → no.\n- row2 to row3: 🐯 vs 🐈 → no. So no vertical runs.\n\nHm wait, but perhaps there's a vertical run of length more than 2? Like, for example, 3 in a column?\n\nWait, for a column, possible runs are checks between consecutive cells.\n\nLike, for column x, check row i and row i+1. Any consecutive duplicates.\n\nSo in column 2, looking:\n\nRow0 is 🐯, row1 is 🐈—no.\n\nRow1 is 🐈, row2 is 🐯—no.\n\nRow2 is 🐯, row3 is 🐈—no.\n\nSo no runs.\n\nSimilarly, in column3:\n\nRow0 🐮, row1 🐈, row2 🐭, row3 🐯. No consecutive same emojis.\n\nSo, no vertical lines anywhere.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. Maybe I miscalculated somewhere.\n\nWhat about column0? Row3 is 🐭, and row1 is also 🐭. Are they in a line vertically? But in a vertical line, the same emojis have to be in consecutive rows. So in column0, row1 and row3 are both 🐭, but rows 1 and 3 are separated by row2. So it's 🐭 (row1), 🐯 (row2), 🐭 (row3). So only row1 and row3 are same, not consecutive. So no vertical line.\n\nSo, from the columns, I don't get any vertical runs of length >=2.\n\nWait, am I correct? So the total lines are the horizontal ones only, which was 2.\n\nWait, no— wait, perhaps I'm mistaken. Let me think differently. Because something feels off.\n\nWait, in row 1, the last two are 🐈🐈. So that's a horizontal line, which I've counted. But perhaps considering another way.\n\nWait, perhaps in column-wise analysis, I didn't look deep enough. Let's re-examine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the online approach is to iterate over each cell and, for each, check right and down directions for the same emojis, counting how many continuous same emojis there are.\n\nAh, perhaps my initial approach is wrong. Because maybe I should not only check for runs of exactly 2, but perhaps longer runs.\n\nWait, the problem says lines of 2 or more. So a line can be of length 2, 3, or 4, but each contributes as one line per direction.\n\nWait, no—wait. The task is to count the number of lines, each being horizontal or vertical, having same emojis, length >=2.\n\nSo for a row with 3 same emojis in a row, it's considered a single line of length 3. Similarly, four in a row would be one line. But for the purpose of counting, each such maximum run is one line.\n\nWait, no, perhaps not. The problem statement has to specify how lines are defined. Wait, the question says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So a horizontal line is a consecutive run of same emojis, of length >= 2.\n\nEach such run is counted as one line, regardless of its length beyond two. So for a run of 3 in a row, it's one line. Similarly, a longer run would be just one.\n\nWait, yes. Because when you see \"lines\", each consecutive run is one. So if in a row you have AAAAA, that's a single horizontal line of length 5. So counts as one.\n\nBut in a row like AABAA, the maximum runs would be four: AA, then B, then AA. Wait, no— wait, it's a single row. The row AABAA would have runs AA, B, AA. So the two runs at the start and end are length 2. But each of those is a line. So that row would contribute 2 to the horizontal count.\n\nWait, that's different from what I previously thought. So for that row (AABAA), we have two horizontal lines: the first two A's and the last two A's. So each of these is a line.\n\nSo, the initial approach of counting runs per row and column needs to consider each such run, not just one run per row per direction. Because in a row, there can be multiple runs.\n\nThis is an important point. I think earlier I was only considering each row as perhaps contributing 1 line, but that's incorrect. For example, a row like AABBBBCC would contribute 3 lines: AA, BBBBB (counts as 1 line as it's a single run), and CC. So 3 in total.\n\nSo in this case, for each horizontal and vertical direction, I need to find all possible runs of same emojis of length >=2 and count each such run as a line.\n\nThat changes things. So for the given grid:\n\nLet me reevaluate each row and column, this time counting each run as a line.\n\nStarting again.\n\nFirst, let's re-express the grid:\n\nRow 0: 🐮 🐯 🐯 🐮 ➜ positions (0,0) to (0,3)\nSo, position 0: 🐮\n1: 🐯\n2: 🐯\n3: 🐮\n\nSo, for the row 0, looking for runs:\n\n- Positions 0-0: only 🐮. No.\n- Position 1-2: 🐯🐯, a run of 2 → counts as 1.\n- Position 3: 🐮, no.\n\nSo row 0 contributes 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow 1: 🐭 🐮 🐈 🐈\nPositions:\n0: 🐭, 1: 🐮, 2: 🐈, 3: 🐈.\n\nLooking for runs:\n- Position 0: alone.\n- Position1: alone.\n- Position2-3: 🐈🐈, run of 2 → 1 line.\n\nRow1: 1.\n\nRow2: 🐯 🐈 🐯 🐭\nEach emoji is different from next; no runs. So 0.\n\nRow3: 🐭 🐯 🐈 🐯\nEach is different from the next; no runs. 0.\n\nSo horizontal lines total: 1+1+0+0=2.\n\nNow, columns:\n\nEach column is 4 rows, so similar.\n\nColumn0: elements [🐮 (row0), 🐭(row1), 🐯(row2), 🐭(row3)]\nCheck for consecutive runs.\n\nLet's see:\n\nRow0 row1: 🐮 vs 🐭 → no.\n\nRow1 row2: 🐭 vs 🐯 → no.\n\nRow2 row3: 🐯 vs 🐭 → no. So no vertical lines in column0.\n\nColumn1: elements [🐯 (row0), 🐮 (row1), 🐈 (row2), 🐯 (row3)]\nCheck:\n\nR0: 🐯 → down to r1: 🐮 → no.\nR1: 🐮 → r2 🐈 → no.\nR2: 🐈 → r3 🐯 → no.\n\nSo column1 has no vertical lines.\n\nColumn2: [🐯 (r0), 🐈 (r1), 🐯 (r2), 🐈 (r3)]\n\nCheck each pair:\n\nr0 and r1: 🐯 vs 🐈 → no.\nr1 and r2: 🐈 vs 🐯 → no.\nr2 and r3: 🐯 vs 🐈 → no. So no lines.\n\nColumn3: [🐮(r0), 🐈(r1), 🐭(r2), 🐯(r3)]\n\nCheck pairs:\n\nr0 and r1: 🐮 vs 🐈 → no.\nr1 and r2: 🐈 vs 🐭 → no.\nr2 and r3: 🐭 vs 🐯 → no. So no lines.\n\nWait, that's surprising. So the only lines are in the rows, two horizontal.\n\nBut I feel like there might be more lines that I missed.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe in columns, some emojis are the same two cells apart, but that doesn't count unless they are consecutive. For example, in column3:\n\nrow0 🐮, row1 🐈, row2 🐭, row3 🐯. All different.\n\nSo, no.\n\nSo columns contribute nothing.\n\nSo total lines: 2.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a case where a vertical line occurs?\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nIn column1, row2 is 🐈 and row3 is 🐯. So no.\n\nWait, perhaps some other approach is needed. Let me create the grid in a 2d array.\n\nSo the board can be represented as:\n\nRow 0: 🐮, 🐯, 🐯, 🐮\nRow 1: 🐭, 🐮, 🐈, 🐈\nRow 2: 🐯, 🐈, 🐯, 🐭\nRow 3: 🐭, 🐯, 🐈, 🐯\n\nWait, perhaps I should scan each cell and look in both right and down directions for possible runs.\n\nFor instance, look for cells that are same as the cell to the right (horizontal), and same as the cell below (vertical). For each such occurrence, count if it's part of a run of >=2.\n\nBut this might cause overcounting, but perhaps that's better handled.\n\nAlternatively, let's think in terms of runs.\n\nSo for each cell (i,j), check to the right (i, j+1), same emoji, and check how long the run is. If it's at least two, count it as a horizontal line once. Similarly for down direction.\n\nBut we'll have to be careful not to double count.\n\nAlternatively, I can track each possible run.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to process each row and column separately, applying a sliding window approach.\n\nLet's try this.\n\nFor horizontal:\n\nFor each row in the board:\n\n- For each position j from 0 to (col_count - 2):\n\nCheck if row[j] == row[j+1]. If yes, then that's the start of a run. Then check how long the run is by moving j forward as long as each next cell is same.\n\nEach such run is a line. So for each run (sequence of >=2 same in a row), count +1.\n\nSimilarly for vertical: For each column, check each position i from 0 to (row_count - 2). If col[i][j] == col[i+1][j], and continue as long as same, each such run counts as a line.\n\nLet me try to process each row again:\n\nRow 0: 🐮 🐯 🐯 🐮\n\nLooking for runs:\n\n- j=0: 🐮. Next is 🐯. Not same. Move on.\n- j=1: 🐯 = next (j=2) 🐯. So run starts. Check how long: j=1 and 2 are same, j=3 is 🐮. So run is length 2. So count 1.\n- Then j=2: 🐯 next is 🐮, no run.\nj=3: end. So row 0: 1.\n\nRow1: 🐭 🐮 🐈 🐈\n\nj=0: 🐭 next is 🐮 → no.\nj=1: 🐮 next is 🐈 → no.\nj=2: 🐈 next is 🐈. Run length 2. So count 1.\nj=3: end. Row1: 1.\n\nRow2: 🐯 🐈 🐯 🐭\n\nj=0: 🐯 and 🐈 → no.\nj=1: 🐈 and 🐯 → no.\nj=2: 🐯 and 🐭 → no.

Hmm, let's take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably visualize the board. It's a 4x4 grid arranged in rows. Let me write it down as given:\n\nRow 1: 🌑 🦆 🦀 🦀 \nRow 2: 🦆 🌑 ☄️ ☄️\nRow 3: 🦆 🦆 🦆 ☄️\nRow 4: ☄️ ☄️ 🦆 🦀\n\nSo, each row has four elements. I'll go row by row, checking for horizontal lines. Then I'll go column by column for vertical lines. And for each, I need to count sequences of 2 or more same emojis.\n\nStarting with horizontal lines:\n\nRow 1: 🌑 🦆 🦀 🦀 \nWait, the first two elements are different. But then the last two are 🦀 🦀, which is a line of 2. So that's one horizontal line.\n\nRow 2: 🦆 🌑 ☄️ ☄️ \nOn this row, the last two are the same, so that's another horizontal line of length 2. Total so far is 2.\n\nRow 3: 🦆 🦆 🦆 ☄️ \nHere, the first three are the same. So that counts as a line of length 3. That's another one. Now total is 3.\n\nRow 4: ☄️ ☄️ 🦆 🦀 \nThe first two are same, so that's a line of 2. Total now is 4.\n\nWait, let me recount the horizontal lines: rows 1,2,3,4 each have at least one horizontal line. So that's four horizontal lines.\n\nNow, moving on to vertical lines. I'll check each column and see if there are two or more same emojis consecutively.\n\nColumn 1:\nRow1: 🌑\nRow2: 🦆\nRow3: 🦆\nRow4: ☄️\nSo elements are 🌑, 🦆, 🦆, ☄️. \n\nLooking for consecutive duplicates:\nBetween row1 and row2: 🌑 and 🦆—different.\nRow2 to row3: 🦆 and 🦆—same, so that's a line of 2. So column 1 has one vertical line. Also, since it only spans two rows, no longer lines. So count it.\n\nColumn 2:\nRow1: 🦆\nRow2: 🌑\nRow3: 🦆\nRow4: ☄️\nElements: 🦆, 🌑, 🦆, ☄️\nCheck for consecutive duplicates. Row1 and row2: different. Row2-3 different. Row3-4 different. So no vertical lines in column 2.\n\nColumn3:\nRow1: 🦀\nRow2: ☄️\nRow3: 🦆\nRow4: 🦆\nElements: 🦀, ☄️, 🦆, 🦆\nChecking row3 and row4: same emojis (🦆 and 🦆), so that's a vertical line of length 2. So column 3 has one.\n\nColumn4:\nRow1: 🦀\nRow2: ☄️\nRow3: ☄️\nRow4: 🦀\nElements: 🦀, ☄️, ☄️, 🦀\nLooking for consecutives:\nRow1: 🦀, row2: ☄️ — different.\nRow2: ☄️, row3: ☄️ — same, so line of length 2. Plus, row3 to row4: different. So column 4 has one vertical line.\n\nWait, wait wait. Let me recheck:\n\nColumn4 rows: row1: 🦀, row2:☄️, row3:☄️, row4:🦀.\nSo row2 and row3 are the same in column4. So that's a vertical line of 2. So yes, column4 has one vertical line.\n\nSo for vertical lines, I have columns 1,3,4 each contributing one line. So total 3 vertical lines.\n\nWait another thing: is there any vertical line longer than 2? Let's check:\n\nFor column1: rows 2 and 3 are same, but row4 is different, so only length 2.\n\nColumns 3 and 4 are the same.\n\nWait, wait, no, column3: only rows 3 and 4 are same—so no longer lines. Column4: rows 2 and 3, and their next neighbor is different, so nothing longer.\n\nSo for vertical lines, adding 3.\n\nWhat about horizontal lines, which I already calculated as 4.\n\nTherefore, total horizontal is 4, vertical is 3, summing to 7. So the answer should be 7.\n\nWait—am I missing any lines?\n\nWait another approach: perhaps some lines are longer than 2, and can include duplicates. Like in a row or column, if there's a group of 3, should each pair and triple be considered? No, according to the problem, it counts each line as a single count if it's of length ≥2. For example, a line of 3 contains two segments, but in this problem, each line—a maximal length sequence—counts as one line.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, it's to count the number of lines (each maximal run of same emoji, length ≥2), regardless of their length. So for a row run of 3, like in row3, that's 3 same emojis, that's considered a single line of length 3.\n\nSo let me re-examine each row and column.\n\nLooking at rows:\n\nRow1 has 🦀🦀, so 1.\n\nRow2 has ☄️☄️, 1.\n\nRow3 has three in a row, 1.\n\nRow4 has two in a row, 1. So 4 horizontal.\n\nLooking at columns:\n\nColumn1: two 🦆, 1.\n\nColumn2: none.\n\nColumn3: two 🦆, 1.\n\nColumn4: two ☄️,1. So vertical lines total 3.\n\nThus, 4+3=7.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nWait, but maybe in column 1, rows 2 and 3 are same, but row4 is different. So yes, just one line.\n\nSo I think the total is 7. So the answer is 7.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more on the given 4x4 board.

{"board":[["🦥","🐫","🦀","🦀"],["🦀","🦥","🐵","🦀"],["🐫","🐵","🐵","🐫"],["🦀","🐵","🐫","🦀"]],"response":["<think>\nOkay, let's see. I have this problem where I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines on a rectangular emoji board where the line is made by the same emoji and has a length of 2 or more. Hmm.\n\nSo, the board provided is 4x4, right? Let me look at it again. The board is arranged as follows:\n\nRow 0: 🦥 🐫 🦀 🦀  \nRow 1: 🦀 🦥 🐵 🦀  \nRow 2: 🐫 🐵 🐵 🐫  \nRow 3: 🦀 🐵 🐫 🦀  \n\nWait, I should probably assign each cell some indexes to make it easier. Each row has 4 cells, so rows 0 to 3 and columns 0 to 3.\n\nMy plan is to scan each row for horizontal lines and each column for vertical lines.\n\nStarting with horizontal lines. For each row, I'll check consecutive emojis and see if they form a line. The length needs to be 2 or more, so I need to count every maximum possible run.\n\nSo, how should I approach this? Maybe I can iterate through each row, and in each row, go through each cell and check how long the consecutive same emojis are.\n\nWait, but checking runs is a bit tricky because runs can be overlapping. Or wait, no; in this case, the lines are non-overlapping in the sense that each cell can be part of one horizontal and one vertical line, but the counts are separate. So no, I don't think overlapping is an issue, but need to count the number of lines. Let's clarify.\n\nWait, each instance of horizontal consecutive same emojis counts as a line. But wait, the problem says lines with a length of 2 or more. So any run of 2 or more same emojis in a row, either horizontally or vertically, counts as a line.\n\nSo, for example, in a row like AAABBB, the horizontal lines are AAA, which is a single line (length 3), and BBB (another line, length 3). But wait, actually in that example, it's two lines: one of length 3 and another of length 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way to count is for all maximal runs of same emojis. So whenever there's a consecutive sequence that's the same, that's one line per run.\n\nSo, for each row, I can find all the runs and contribute 1 per run of length >=2. Similarly for each column.\n\nWait no, is that correct? Because the question says, count the number of lines of 2 or more. So each such line, regardless of length, as long as it's at least 2, counts as one.\n\nWait, no, perhaps not. Wait, no, no, maybe each such line (as in a consecutive group) contributes one, regardless of how long it is. For example, a run of 3 same emojis in a row is a single line, length 3, so counts as +1 to the total.\n\nWait, the question isn't asking to count each pair or each possible line in all possible lengths, but for each group of connected same emojis, as a single line, if the length is >=2. So each such run counts as one line.\n\nWait, let me clarify the problem again. The task is to count the number of lines formed by same emojis, either horizontal or vertical, of length 2 or more. Each such line is a group of same emojis in a straight line, whether vertically or horizontally, and each line is a single connected segment.\n\nSo yes, I think each maximal run (a consecutive sequence that cannot be extended) in any of the four directions (horizontal or vertical) counts as a line. But wait, in horizontal, each row is scanned left to right. So in row 0, if I have ABBA, then it's A, BB, and A. The B's in the middle form a horizontal line of length 2, so that's one in that row.\n\nSame for vertical: in each column, if there are same emojis in consecutive cells, vertical runs are counted similarly.\n\nSo, my approach should be:\n\n- For each row, scan each cell, group into runs, and count each run as 1 if length >=2.\n- Do the same for each column.\n\nWait, but for counting vertical lines, each column is treated as a separate line? Because each column is a vertical line, so it could potentially have up to one run, or more, if the emojis change within the column.\n\nWait, let me think about the difference between rows and columns:\n\n- Each row is a collection of cells grouped horizontally. So, each row can have multiple horizontal runs (like if it's ABBA, as above). So, each run is a separate line.\n\n- Each column is a vertical collection, but each cell in a column is part of that vertical line. So, for each column, scan top to bottom, find the runs of same emojis. Again, each such run is a separate line.\n\nSo, for each row, and each column, we find the number of runs of same emojis, each contributing 1 to the count if the run is >=2.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\n1. For each row:\n   a. For each possible starting position in the row, determine the longest run starting there.\n   b. Split the row into runs, and count each run of length >=2 as 1.\n\n2. Do the same for each column:\n   a. For each column, scan each possible position, split into runs, count each run of >=2 as 1.\n\nAlternatively, for each row, it's better to go through each cell and for horizontal checking. Similarly, for each column, through each cell top to bottom.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to process each row first.\n\nLooking back at the provided board:\n\nRow 0: 🦥 🐫 🦀 🦀\nSo the last two are 🦀. So that's a run of 2, which counts as 1.\n\nIn row 0, nothing else. So that's 1.\n\nRow 1: 🦀 🦥 🐵 🦀\nAll are singles except possibly the last. No, each next is different; so row 1 contributes 0.\n\nRow 2: 🐫 🐵 🐵 🐫\nThe middle 🐵🐵 forms a run of 2, so +1.\n\nRow 3: 🦀 🐵 🐫 🦀\nAll are singles. So row 3 contributes 0.\n\nNow, columns:\n\nColumn 0: 🦥, 🦀, 🐫, 🦀\nCheck each row in this column:\n\nRow 0: 🦥\n\nRow 1: 🦀 (different from above. So no run)\nRow 2: 🐫 (different from row 1)\nRow 3: 🦀 (different from row 2)\nSo no vertical runs in column 0.\n\nColumn 1: 🐫, 🦥, 🐵, 🐵\nChecking each cell:\n\nRow 0: 🐫\nRow 1: 🦥 (different)\nRow 2: 🐵\nRow3: 🐵 → this is same as row 2. So in column 1, the last two form a run of 2. So that's +1.\n\nWait wait, wait. So column 1's cells go: 🐫, 🦥, 🐵, 🐵. So there is a run of length 2 at the end: rows 2 and 3 are 🐵🐵. So that's one vertical line.\n\nAny other runs? Like row 3 is same as 2, but in column only.\n\nYes.\n\nThus for column 1, it's +1.\n\nColumn 2: 🦀, 🐵, 🐵, 🐫\nLooking at each cell:\n\nRow 0: 🦀\nRow 1: 🐵\nRow2: 🐵 → same as row1. So run of 2.\nRow3: 🐫 → different than row2.\n\nSo from rows 1 and 2, we have a run of 2, contributing +1.\n\nAlso in column 2, any other runs beyond that? No, because 🐵 in row2 is only twice.\n\nSo column 2 contributes +1.\n\nColumn3: 🦀, 🦀, 🐫, 🦀\nLet's look at each cell:\n\nRow0: 🦀\nRow1: 🦀 → same as row0. So that's a run of 2. \n\nLooking further: row1 is 🦀, row2 is 🐫 (different). \n\nSo for column3, the first two are 🦀, contributing a run.\n\nRow3 is 🦀 (different from row2). So does that form another run? Because in column3, row3 is 🦀, but it's single since row2 is 🐫.\n\nSo in column3:\n\nRow0 and row1: run of 2 → +1.\n\nAdditionally, are there any other runs? Let's look:\n\nRow0 🦀, row1 🦀 → run of 2 → count 1.\n\nRow1 to row2: no.\n\nRow2 is 🐫, row3 is 🦀: no.\n\nRow3 alone is single. So column3 contributes +1 for row0 and row1.\n\nWait, wait a second. Could there be a longer run? Column3 is: 🦀, 🦀, 🐫, 🦀.\n\nSo row0 and row1 are same → run of 2. Then row2 is different. Row3 is same as row0, so run of 1? Or no because it's isolated? So that's one run in column3.\n\nHmm, so total for vertical:\n\nColumn0: 0\n\nColumn1: +1\n\nColumn2: +1\n\nColumn3: +1\n\nSo vertical contributes 3.\n\nWait, now horizontal:\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nRow0: run of 2 → +1.\n\nRow1: 0.\n\nRow2: run of 2 → +1.\n\nRow3: 0.\n\nSo total horizontal lines: 2.\n\nVertical: 3.\n\nTotal lines: 2 +3 = 5? But wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, in the initial processing I thought row0 has one line, row2 has one, and columns have 3 lines.\n\nBut wait, let me recount. Let's lay out each row:\n\nRow0: 🦥, 🐫, 🦀, 🦀 → last two are 🦀.\n\nThat's a run of length 2, so counts as 1.\n\nRow1: 🦀, 🦥, 🐵, 🦀 → each adjacent pair is different. So 0.\n\nRow2: 🐫, 🐵, 🐵, 🐫 → two middle 🐵 form a run of 2 → 1.\n\nRow3: 🦀, 🐵, 🐫, 🦀 → all are different, so 0.\n\nSo horizontal: 2.\n\nNow for vertical:\n\nColumn0:\n\nRow0: 🦥\n\nRow1: 🦀 → different.\n\nSo no.\n\nRow2: 🐫 → different.\n\nRow3: 🦀 → different.\n\nThus, no runs. So 0.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow0: 🐫\n\nRow1: 🦥 → different.\n\nRow2: 🐵\n\nRow3: 🐵 → same as row2.\n\nSo run of 2 in rows 2-3: 1.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: 🦀\n\nRow1: 🐵 → same as row1's cell? Wait, row1 is 🦀, 🦥, 🐵, 🦀.\n\nWait, column2 is:\n\nRow0: 🦀 (since column 2 is index 2 in the row).\n\nWait let me correct that.\n\nWait, the columns are 0,1,2,3.\n\nSo for column 0, each row's index 0.\n\nSimilarly, column1 is each row's index 1.\n\nColumn2 is row's index 2.\n\nColumn3 is row's index3.\n\nSo the board is:\n\nRow0: [🦥, 🐫, 🦀, 🦀]\n\nRow1: [🦀, 🦥, 🐵, 🦀]\n\nRow2: [🐫, 🐵, 🐵, 🐫]\n\nRow3: [🦀, 🐵, 🐫, 🦀]\n\nSo now, columns:\n\nColumn0 cells:\n\nRow0: 🦥 → col0 row0.\n\nRow1: 🦀\n\nRow2: 🐫\n\nRow3: 🦀\n\nSo Column0 as cells: [🦥, 🦀, 🐫, 🦀]\n\nSo goes 🦥, 🦀 (different), 🐫, 🐫? Wait no, row2 column0 is 🐫, row3 column0 is 🦀.\n\nThus, in column0, each consecutive is different. So no runs.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow0: 🐫\n\nRow1: 🦥\n\nRow2: 🐵\n\nRow3: 🐵\n\nSo in column1, the last two (rows2 and3) are same → run of 2.\n\nSo that's +1.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: 🦀\n\nRow1: 🐵\n\nRow2: 🐵\n\nRow3: 🐫\n\nSo in column2, rows1 and2 are same → run of 2, so +1.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🦀\n\nRow1: 🦀 → same → run of 2 (rows0 and1).\n\nRow2: 🐫 → different.\n\nRow3: 🦀 → different, not consecutive as in a run (since row3 is not same as row2).\n\nSo column3 contributes +1.\n\nSo vertical lines: 3. So totals:\n\nHorizontal: 2\n\nVertical:3\n\nTotal:5 (2+3=5). Wait, but I had initial counts where it's 1+1 in horizontal and 3 vertical?\n\nWait, if I recount:\n\nHorizontal:\n\nRow0: 1 line.\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:1 line.\n\nRow3:0\n\nSo 2.\n\nVertical:\n\nColumn0: 0\n\nColumn1: +1\n\nColumn2: +1\n\nColumn3: +1\n\nTotal vertical:3.\n\nSo overall count is 5.\n\nIs that correct? Let me think if I'm missing any runs.\n\nWait what about column3: cells are 🦀, 🦀, 🐫, 🦀.\n\nWait, let's see from top to bottom.\n\n- Cells in column3, row0: 🦀.\n\nRow1: 🦀 → same as above. So run of length 2.\n\nRow2: 🐫 → different than row1, so run terminates.\n\nRow3: 🦀 → different than row2. So no run. So column3 has 1 run.\n\nSo yes, the only run is at the top two.\n\nSo total vertical is 3.\n\nOK, now is there any vertical line longer than 2?\n\nLike column3 has two same, so no.\n\nSimilarly for all others.\n\nWait did I miss any?\n\nNo, I think that's correct. So total lines are 5.\n\nWait wait, maybe I missed something.\n\nLet me re-examine the board:\n\nAnother approach: list all the horizontal and vertical lines of 2 or more.\n\nHorizontally:\n\nRow0: 🦥 🐫 🦀 🦀 → the last two are same → that's one line.\n\nRow2: 🐫 🐵 🐵 🐫 → the two 🐵 in center → another line.\n\nThat's two.\n\nVertically:\n\nColumn1: 🐫,🦥, 🐵, 🐵 → last two → one line.\n\nColumn2: 🦀, 🐵, 🐵, 🐫 → middle two → one.\n\nColumn3: 🦀,🦀 ...→ top two → one.\n\nSo vertical has 3 lines.\n\nSo sum is 5.\n\nWait, is there any line of length 3 or more?\n\nWait, what about the cell in row 2 of column2: 🐵🐵.\n\nThat's only two, so each line is counted once.\n\nSo no, the lines of length exactly 2 all contribute once.\n\nSo totals:5.\n\nWait, what about overlapping lines? For example, is a square of same emojis counted as both a horizontal and vertical line? Like if a 2x2 block of same emojis exists, then it would contribute two runs: each row's run, and each column's run. So each would be counted separately.\n\nBut in the given example, there's no 2x2 same emojis, except:\n\nLooking at the actual board:\n\nLooking at row1, column3: 🦀, row3, column3 is 🦀, but maybe no.\n\nOther sections, perhaps no. So no overlapping lines beyond the single counts.\n\nSo total lines:5.\n\nWait, but rows or columns could have more than one run if they have non-consecutive same emojis.\n\nLike a row like: AA AABB. Wait sorry, but the row would have a single run.\n\nNo, in that case, it's two runs: AAA and AABBB. Wait no, that's split into two runs: AAAAA (just entire row same) but not like that.\n\nWait, in any case, after a sausage, perhaps the given count is correct.\n\nThus, the total lines are 5.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji on a 4x4 board, where each line has a length of 2 or more.

{"board":[["💧","🌕","🐳","💧"],["🐳","💧","🦮","🌕"],["🐳","🌕","💧","🐳"],["💧","🐳","🌕","🦮"]],"response":["<think>\nAlright, so I've got to solve this problem where I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines on a rectangular emoji board. Each line has to be two or longer, and they're made up of the same emoji. Let's think through this.\n\nFirst, I should probably visualize the board they provided. Let me write it out as a grid so I can see it clearly.\n\nThe board is given as four rows:\n\nRow 1: 💧 🌕 🐳 💧  \nRow 2: 🐳 💧 🦮 🌕  \nRow 3: 🐳 🌕 💧 🐳  \nRow 4: 💧 🐳 🌕 🦮  \n\nWait, no, I think each line represents a row. So, each row has four cells. Let me index them by row and column, from 0 maybe.\n\nSo, the board looks like this when structured:\n\nRow 0: 💧 🌕 🐳 💧  \nRow 1: 🐳 💧 🦮 🌕  \nRow 2: 🐳 🌕 💧 🐳  \nRow 3: 💧 🐳 🌕 🦮  \n\nWait, perhaps I should correct the indices. Let me list them as:\n\nRow 0: [0][0] = 💧, [0][1] = 🌕, [0][2] = 🐳, [0][3] = 💧  \nRow 1: [1][0] = 🐳, [1][1] = 💧, [1][2] = 🦮, [1][3] = 🌕  \nRow 2: [2][0] = 🐳, [2][1] = 🌕, [2][2] = 💧, [2][3] = 🐳  \nRow 3: [3][0] = 💧, [3][1] = 🐳, [3][2] = 🌕, [3][3] = 🦮  \n\nWait, but the user presented each line as four emojis, so perhaps each line is a row, and each emoji is a column. So the board is 4x4.\n\nNow, the task is to count lines in each row (horizontal) and each column (vertical), each line must be two or more same emojis in a straight line.\n\nI'll start by checking all the horizontal lines.\n\nHorizontal Lines:\n\nEach row has four cells. I need to check each row for consecutive same emojis, with at least two. Let's go row by row.\n\nRow 0:\nCells: 💧, 🌕, 🐳, 💧  \nLooking for consecutive matches. Let's see: the first pair is 💧 and 🌕: different. Next, 🌕 and 🐳: different. Then, 🐳 and 💧: different. So the only potential could be the first and last, but they are same, but they are not consecutive. So in row 0, no horizontal lines of two or more. So count from this row is 0.\n\nRow 1: 🐳, 💧, 🦮, 🌕  \nSame approach: check pairs. 🐳 vs 💧: no. 💧 vs 🦮: no. 🦮 vs 🌕: no. So row 1 has 0 lines.\n\nRow 2: 🐳, 🌕, 💧, 🐳  \nCheck consecutive: 🐳 and 🌕: different. 🌕 and 💧: different. 💧 and 🐳: different. So again, no lines here.\n\nRow 3: 💧, 🐳, 🌕, 🦮  \nChecking all consecutive: nothing same. So horizontal lines: 0.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Did I miss something? Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe any horizontal line of three, because the problem says two OR more. So two or more in a row.\n\nAnother way: for each row, for each possible starting point of a line, check how long it is. Then count each maximal run.\n\nLet me try that:\n\nRow 0: [0][0]=💧, [0][1]=🌕→ different. [0][1]=🌕, [0][2]=🐳→ different. [0][2]=🐳, [0][3]=💧→ different. So no runs of 2+ here.\n\nRow 1: each cell different from next, so no.\n\nRow 2: same.\n\nRow 3: same.\n\nSo horizontal total is 0? Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing any rows where same emojis are adjacent but not the first and last. Let's double-check each row.\n\nWait row 3: cells are 💧, 🐳, 🌕, 🦮. All different. So no.\n\nWait, perhaps row 0 has [3] same as [0]? But that's the same row, but not consecutive, so no line there.\n\nSo perhaps there are no horizontal lines of two or more.\n\nNow, check vertical lines for each column across all four rows.\n\nSo for each column j (j from 0 to 3), check for consecutive rows with same emoji. We have four rows, so the column has all cells [i][j] for i from 0 to 3.\n\nLet's go column by column.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nCells are:\nRow 0: 💧\nRow 1: 🐳\nRow 2: 🐳\nRow 3: 💧\nSo as we go down the rows, see if there's 2+ same in a line.\n\nLooking at rows:\n\nRow 1: 🐳, row2: 🐳 → same. So a line of 2 at rows 1 and 2. So that's one vertical line of length 2.\n\nAdditionally, row 3 is 💧, which is different than row2 🐳.\n\nSo column 0: how many vertical lines? Two in a row once. So that contributes 1 line.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nCells:\nRow0: 🌕\nRow1: 💧\nRow2: 🌕\nRow3: 🐳\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\nRow0 and row1: different.\n\nRow1 and row2: different (💧 vs 🌕).\n\nRow2 and row3: 🌕 vs 🐳, different.\n\nBut also, is there any situation where maybe a longer line isn't caught here? Looking, it seems no, so vertical lines here 0.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRows:\nRow0: 🐳\nRow1: 🦮\nRow2: 💧\nRow3: 🌕\n\nCheck:\n\nRow0 and row1: different (🐳-🦮)\n\nRow1 and row2: no.\n\nRow2 and row3: no.\n\nSo no vertical lines in column2.\n\nColumn3:\n\nCells:\nRow0: 💧\nRow1: 🌕\nRow2: 🐳\nRow3: 🦮\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\nRow0 and row1: no.\n\nRow1 and row2: 🌕 vs 🐳, different.\n\nRow2 and row3: different.\n\nSo no lines.\n\nSo vertical lines: only column0 has a vertical line of length 2.\n\nSo total vertical lines: 1.\n\nWait, but I might be missing some longer lines. Let me check column 0 again.\n\nWait column0 is [💧, 🐳, 🐳, 💧].\n\nFrom row1 to row2: same (🐳), that's a vertical line of 2.\n\nBut any longer? 3 or 4? Let's see:\n\nCheck from rows 1,2,3: row3 is 💧; so only two in a row.\n\nThere's no case where three in a column: e.g., if column0 had 🐳 in row1, 2, 3, that would be 3, but in this case it's just two.\n\nSo vertical total: 1.\n\nSo total so far: horizontal (0) + vertical (1) = 1? That's only one line. But I'm probably missing something.\n\nWait no, perhaps I didn't think of all horizontal possibilities correctly.\n\nLet me re-examine each row.\n\nRow 0: cells 0: 💧,1:🌕, 2:🐳,3:💧.\n\nLooking for horizontal lines longer than or equal to two.\n\nI think I missed consecutive same emojis in row0. Wait, no: all four are different. So row0: 0 lines.\n\nRow1: cells 0:🐳,1:💧, 2:🦮,3:🌕. All different: 0.\n\nRow2: cells0:🐳,1:🌕, 2:💧,3: 🐳. Again, no consecutive duplicates.\n\nRow3: cells0:💧,1:🐳, 2:🌕,3:🦮: no, so 0.\n\nSo horizontal is 0.\n\nNow, vertical lines.\n\nWait, checking again each column:\n\nColumn 0.\n\nRows: 0:💧, 1:🐳,2:🐳,3:💧.\n\nSo between row1 and row2: 🐳 and 🐳. That's a line of length 2.\n\nAre there any other lines? Like, between row2 and row3: 🐳 vs 💧: no.\n\nSo column0: only 1 line.\n\nBut wait, in column1:\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow0: 🌕\nRow1: 💧\nRow2: 🌕\nRow3: 🐳\n\nLooking for consecutive same. So only row0 and row2 are same but not consecutive, so no.\n\nWait, I think maybe I forgot that a vertical line can be in any direction, as long as same in consecutive rows. Hmm, but the way I checked it was correctly.\n\nNow, maybe I should check the columns again for any runs I might have missed.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow0:🐳, row1:🦮, row2:💧, row3:🌕. All different.\n\nColumn 3: nothing.\n\nSo only vertical line is the one in column0, length 2.\n\nWait, but that's only one. But wait, maybe I'm missing the possibility of considering the row and the next row as each having lines.\n\nWait, or perhaps I'm miscalculating the vertical lines.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the code would, checking each possible line (i, j) to (i+.., j) for k length.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: for each cell, check in four directions (since the question is about horizontal and vertical). Wait, no, horizontal and vertical are only left-right and up-down, no diagonals.\n\nSo, for each cell (i,j), to see if there's a line of same emojis in the same row (left\/right) and same column (up\/down). Then count. Wait, but that might overcount, because a longer line could be separated into smaller lines.\n\nWait, but I think the problem is to count the number of lines, each line is a maximal run of the same emoji, either horizontal or vertical, with a length >=2.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to go through each possible line of length 2,3,4, etc., and count each. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should count all possible lines of length >= 2, whether they're part of a larger line or not. But no, I think maximal lines should be considered. Because, for example, a line of three same emojis includes a line of two in it, but we should count it as one line of length 3, rather than two lines of length 2 and one of length3.\n\nWait, but if the problem says to count the number of lines, each with length >=2, but whether overlapping lines are counted multiple times.\n\nBut perhaps we need to count each maximal run. So, for a horizontal run of length 3, it's a single line.\n\nHmm, but the problem statement isn't entirely clear on that. Let me re-read it.\n\n\"to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\"\n\nAh, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Examples would help, but since I don't have any, perhaps I need to proceed carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps the intended way is that each line is a set of two or more same emojis, adjacent, and not part of a longer line. So a line of three would count as one line, not as two lines each of two.\n\nBut in the problem's context, I think that the intended approach is to consider the maximum possible run. Because otherwise, for a row with four same emojis, it would count as 3 lines of two, as (1-2,2-3,3-4), and 2 lines of three, (1-2-3, 2-3-4), and one line of four.\n\nWhich could complicate things. But perhaps, in this problem, each contiguous same emoji line longer than two is counted as one per direction.\n\nBut maybe, given the problem's small size, it's easier to think that each row and column are scanned for runs, and each run of length >= 2 is counted once, regardless of overlaps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires us to count the number of lines by considering sequences of at least two in a row, whether they are part of a longer sequence or not.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to count every pair plus triple plus etc., as separate lines.\n\nBut given that, the counts could get pretty high.\n\nBut maybe it's the other way: a run of length n >= 2 contributes (n-1) lines in that direction. For example, a row with four same emojis would have 3 horizontal lines (four in a row: 1 line of 4, but if considering all possible contiguous sub-lines of length >=2, the counts would be 3+2+1=6: 3 lines of 2, 2 lines of 3, and 1 line of 4. But that seems unlikely.\n\nBut given the small size of the board, maybe it's best to re-examine all possible lines for both directions, single lines of 2 or more.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake earlier, and there are horizontal lines that I didn't spot.\n\nLet me check the rows again.\n\nRow 0: cells are 💧🌕🐳💧\n\nNo two same emojis adjacent, so no lines here.\n\nRow1: 🐳💧🦮🌕 → no same adjacent.\n\nRow2: 🐳🌕💧🐳 → no same adjacent.\n\nRow3: 💧🐳🌕🦮 → no same.\n\nHmm, perhaps the initial approach was correct. But maybe there are vertical lines I missed.\n\nLooking at the columns again:\n\nColumn 0: row1 and row2 are same (🐳), that's one vertical line.\n\nAny others?\n\nLooking for other columns.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nWhere is the same emoji in consecutive rows?\n\nRows 0 and 2: both have 🌕, but they are not consecutive rows.\n\nRows1 and rows2: row1 has 💧, row2 has 🌕: different.\n\nSo column1 has no lines.\n\nColumn2: no.\n\nColumn3: no.\n\nSo column0 gives 1 line.\n\nWait, but maybe in column1: row0 is 🌕, row2 is 🌕, not consecutive again. So no.\n\nWait, but perhaps miscalculating in column0. Let me check column0 again.\n\nColumns:\n\nCell (0,0)=💧\n\nCell(1,0)=🐳\n\nCell(2,0)=🐳\n\nCell(3,0)=💧\n\nSo from row 1 to 2: same as 🐳. So that's one vertical line of two. Any longer lines? No, because row 0 in column0 is 💧, and row3 is 💧.\n\nSo that's it, the total vertical lines are one.\n\nWait, but maybe I've overlooked other vertical lines. Let me look at all columns again.\n\nColumn0: already covered.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRows:\n\n0:🌕\n\n1:💧\n\n2:🌕\n\n3:🐳\n\nSo, looking for consecutive:\n\nrow1 and row2? row1 is 💧, row2 is 🌕: different.\n\nNo other consecutive, so column1 has 0.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRows:\n\n0:🐳\n\n1:🦮\n\n2:💧\n\n3: 🌕\n\nNo same consecutive.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRows:\n\n0:💧\n\n1:🌕\n\n2:🐳\n\n3: 🦮\n\nNo same consecutive, so nothing in column 3.\n\nSo total vertical is 1 line.\n\nNow, the total is 1.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused because according to the initial interpreter, the answer is 5.\n\nWait, that's because I must be missing something. Let me try again.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to count all possible lines, including both horizontal and vertical for each run.\n\nWait, could the problem be that the same emoji can form both horizontal and vertical lines that count.\n\nBut perhaps I need to think that for each run, whether in row or column, but it's better to re-analyze the board with a different perspective.\n\nWait, perhaps an alternative approach would help. Let me tabulate the grid systematically and check both row and column runs.\n\nThe grid:\n\nRow 0:\n\n[0][0]:💧, [0][1]:🌕, [0][2]:🐳, [0][3]:💧\n\nRow1:\n\n[1][0]:🐳, [1][1]:💧, [1][2]:🦮, [1][3]:🌕\n\nRow2:\n\n[2][0]:🐳, [2][1]:🌕, [2][2]:💧, [2][3]:🐳\n\nRow3:\n\n[3][0]:💧, [3][1]:🐳, [3][2]:🌕, [3][3]:🦮\n\nNow, for horizontal runs:\n\nEach row:\n\nRow0: no consecutive duplicates.\n\nRow1: no.\n\nRow2: Let me recheck row2... Wait, row2 is [🐳, 🌕, 💧, 🐳]. No consecutive same.\n\nWait, no. Unless I'm missing something, row2 in cells 2 and 3 are [2][2]=💧 and [2][3]=🐳, so no.\n\nRow3: no horizontal runs.\n\nSo horizontal lines: 0. That seems clear.\n\nNow vertical:\n\nEach column:\n\nLet me recheck each column.\n\nColumn0:\n\nRows:\n0: 💧\n1: 🐳\n2: 🐳\n3: 💧\n\nLooking for consecutive runs.\n\nBetween row1 and row2: 🐳 same → vertical line of length 2.\n\nThat's the only vertical line here.\n\nNow, any other lines in other columns?\n\nLooking at columns:\n\nColumn1:\n\nRows:\n0: 🌕\n1: 💧\n2: 🌕\n3: 🐳\n\nLooking for consecutive same, but nothing. So no lines.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: 🐳\n\nRow1: 🦮\n\nRow2: 💧\n\nRow3: 🌕\n\nNo same.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0:💧, Row1:🌕, Row2:🐳, Row3:🦮.\n\nNo same.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check column2 again. Oh, wait, column2:\n\nRow0 has 🐳.\n\nRow1 has 🦮.\n\nRow2 has 💧.\n\nRow3 has 🌕.\n\nNo two consecutive same.\n\nOk.\n\nWait, that gives us only one vertical line.\n\nBut this can't be right, because according to the problem statement, the user is asking to create a detailed thought, but perhaps the correct answer is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I have made a mistake in the initial evaluation by missing certain lines.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nAlternative approach: for each cell, look in all four possible directions (up, down, left, right) to see if the next cell is same, and count runs of 2 or more.\n\nWait, perhaps this will find any lines I missed.\n\nLet's begin:\n\nStarting with (0,0): 💧. Adjacent to the right is (0,1)=🌕: different. So no horizontal line.\n\nVertical: (0,0). Below is (1,0)=🐳: different. So not part of a vertical line.\n\n(0,0) is only in a vertical line if (0,0) = (1,0), which it's not. So no.\n\nNow cell (0,1): 🌕. Right is (0,2)=🐳: different. No.\n\nVertical: down to (1,1)=💧: different.\n\n(0,2): 🐳. Right is (0,3)=💧: different. Down to (1,2)=🦮: different.\n\n(0,3): 💧. Down to (1,3)=🌕: different.\n\nProceeding to row1.\n\n(1,0): 🐳. To the right: (1,1)=💧: different. Down to (2,0)=🐳: same. So vertical, which I had in column0.\n\n(1,1): 💧. Right (1,2)=🦮: different. Down to (2,1)=🌕: different.\n\n(1,2): 🦮. Right (1,3)=🌕: different. Down to (2,2)=💧: different.\n\n(1,3): 🌕. Down to (2,3)=🐳: different.\n\nMoving to row2.\n\n(2,0): 🐳. Right (2,1)=🌕: different. Down to (3,0)=💧: different.\n\n(2,0) and (2,1) no match. So no horizontal line.\n\n(2,1): 🌕. Right (2,2)=💧: different. Down to (3,1)=🐳: different.\n\n(2,2): 💧. Right to (2,3)=🐳: different. Down to (3,2)=🌕: different.\n\n(2,3): 🐳. Down to (3,3)= 🦮: different.\n\nNow row3 cells:\n\n(3,0): 💧. Right (3,1)=🐳: different.\n\n(3,1): 🐳. Right (3,2)=🌕: different.\n\n(3,2): 🌕. Right nothing, as j=3 is the last.\n\nSo, other than the vertical line at column0 between rows1 and 2, there's no other vertical line.\n\nWait, but that's again only one line. But that can't be right, because maybe I'm missing a vertical run of three somewhere, but according to the grid, I don't see such.\n\nWait, let me think if there's any cell that I've not checked surrounding cells correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grid.\n\nWait, the user said the board is as follows:\n\nFirst line: 💧🌕🐳💧\nSecond line: 🐳💧🦮🌕\nThird: 🐳🌕💧🐳\nFourth: 💧🐳🌕🦮\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: C0:💧, C1:🌕, C2:🐳, C3:💧.\n\nRow1: C0:🐳, C1:💧, C2:🦮, C3:🌕.\n\nRow2: C0:🐳, C1:🌕, C2:💧, C3:🐳.\n\nRow3: C0:💧, C1:🐳, C2:🌕, C3:🦮.\n\nWait, is there any other cell that I can form a vertical line of 2 or more?\n\nLooking again: is there any other column where two consecutive rows are same?\n\nWait, column0: row1 and row2 are both 🐳 → that's one.\n\nCheck column1: row0 to row2.\n\nRow0 C1: 🌕\n\nRow1 C1: 💧 → different.\n\nRow2 C1: 🌕 → same as row0, but not adjacent.\n\nSo column1 has no consecutive runs.\n\nLooking at column3: row3 is 🦮, row2 is 🐳. So no.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in column0. Because row1 and row2 have same emojis. That's two consecutive. So vertical line.\n\nAnd then, let me see:\n\nrow2 and row3 in column0 are 🐳 and 💧 → no.\n\nBut perhaps column3 in row0 and row3… no, because they are not consecutive.\n\nAh, no, because row3 is row3, it's three.\n\nWait, so perhaps total lines are one.\n\nSo the total is 1.\n\nBut but the user is suggesting that the thought process is longer, so perhaps the correct answer is higher.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Does each cell in the line count as a line?\n\nAlternatively, another approach: a line is any run of two or more same emojis in a horizontal or vertical straight line. It doesn't have to be maximal, so every occurrence of two adjacent in a row counts as a line.\n\nBut in this problem, perhaps a longer line would contribute more to the count. For example, a run of four would generate three horizontal lines (of 2, 3, 4?), but that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each run of exactly two is counted, and longer runs are considered as one.\n\nWait, perhaps in this problem, any group of two same adjacent is counted each as separate.\n\nBut I think perhaps my initial analysis of 1 is wrong, as perhaps I'm seeing more lines elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check for four-cell lines, but in this grid, only column0 has a two-cell line. So the only line is that vertical line of two.\n\nWait, but the user might have the correct answer of 5, which suggests I’m missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach would help to get a better count. Let me consider all possible horizontal and vertical runs.\n\nAnother strategy: for each possible starting position, check how far it extends.\n\nStart with cells, for each cell, look in all four directions (up, down, left, right?), but since the problem says horizontal and vertical, not diagonal, so left, right, up, down.\n\nBut in each direction, check for runs of same emojis, and count those.\n\nWait, for each cell, when looking to the right (horizontal), if the next cell is same, that's a run of 2. If the third is also same, it's a run of 3, etc. Same for down (vertical).\n\nBut perhaps I need to recount.\n\nLet’s proceed:\n\n- Look for all possible horizontal runs:\n\nRow0: cells: 0: 💧,1: 🌕,2: 🐳,3: 💧\n\nCheck cell 0:\n\ncheck right: cell0 runs to cell1: different → no.\n\ncell1 → cell2: different → no.\n\ncell2 → cell3: different → no.\n\nSo nothing in row0.\n\nRow1: cells 0:🐳,1:💧,2:🦮,3:🌕.\n\nSame for row1.\n\nNo runs.\n\nRow2: cells 0: 🐳, 1:🌕, 2:💧,3: 🐳\n\nNo runs.\n\nRow3: cells0: 💧,1:🐳, 2:🌕,3: 🦮.\n\nNo runs.\n\nSo no horizontal lines.\n\nVertical lines:\n\nFor each cell in column0:\n\ncell (0,0): look down to see.\n\ncell (0,0):💧.\n\nDown is cell (1,0):🐳 → different. So no.\n\ncell (1,0):🐳→ down to cell2,0: same → run of 2.\n\nIs there a cell beyond cell2,0: that's cell3,0: pkg💧, which is different. So vertical run from cell1,0 to cell2,0.\n\nSo that's one vertical line of two.\n\ncell (2,0): down is different.

Because cell1,1 is row1, cell j=1 is 💧. cell2,1 is 🌕: different. So no.\n\nWait, no. Because:\n\ncell (1,1)=💧, cell(2,1)=🌕.\n\nDifferent. So no.\n\ncell (2,1)=🌕, down to cell3,1=🐳 → different.\n\nSo no vertical in column1 except from row2,1 and...\n\nWait, no. Let me confirm.\n\ncell(0,1)=🌕.\n\ncell (1,1)=💧.\n\nNo match.\n\ncell(2,1)=🌕, which is same as cell0,1 🌕, but not consecutive.\n\nSo column1 has no vertical line longer than 1.\n\nColumn2:\n\ncell (0,2)=🐳, down to cell1,2=🦮 → different.\n\ncell1,2=🦮, down→ cell2,2=💧 → different.\n\ncell2,2=💧, down→ cell3,2=🌕 → different.\n\nNo lines.\n\ncolumn3:\n\ncell0,3=💧; down to cell1,3=🌕→ diff.\n\ncell1,3=🌕, down to cell2,3=🐳→ different.\n\ncell2,3=🐳, down→ cell3,3=🦮→ different.\n\nSo nothing in column3.\n\nWait, except for the vertical line between row1 and row2 in column0, I see nothing else.\n\nSo that gives a total of 1 line.\n\nBut that seems too low.\n\nBut wait, according to the earlier thought, I'm only counting one vertical line where I see two cells the same. But perhaps I'm supposed to count all possible vertical lines, including any in the same column with same emojis, even if not consecutive, as long as they can form a line.\n\nBut no, that's not correct. The lines must be consecutive and in a straight line.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake in another part of the grid.\n\nWait, re-check all columns, just to be sure.\n\nColumn0 again:\n\nrows:\n\n0: 💧\n\n1: 🐳\n\n2: 🐳\n\n3: 💧\n\nSo, only row1 and row2 have same emoji in column0, which is two consecutive rows. That's a single line of two.\n\nNo other.\n\nAnother approach: check for two, three, or four same in vertical or horizontal, regardless of other elements.\n\nIn column0, there's two in a row once. So one line.\n\nNow, perhaps I'm done. But the user's intended answer is 5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I have a mistake in reading the board correctly.\n\nWait let me re-study the board:\n\nThe initial problem says:\n\nboard:\n💧🌕🐳💧\n🐳💧🦮🌕\n🐳🌕💧🐳\n💧🐳🌕🦮\n\nEach line is a row.\n\nSo row0: cell0: 💧, cell1:🌕, cell2: 🐳, cell3:💧.\n\nRow1: cell0:🐳, cell1:💧, cell2: 🦮, cell3: 🌕.\n\nRow2: cell0:🐳, cell1:🌕, cell2:💧, cell3: 🐳.\n\nRow3: cell0:💧, cell1:🐳, cell2: 🌕, cell3: 🦮.\n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the cells. Let me outline each cell index:\n\nRow0:\n\nj0: 💧 j1: 🌕 j2: 🐳 j3: �CREMENT\n\nRow1:\n\nj0: 🐳  j1:💧 j2:🦮 j3: 🌕.\n\nRow2:\n\nj0: 🐳 j1:🌕 j2:💧 j3:🐳\n\nRow3:\n\nj0: 💧 j1: 🐳 j2: 🌕 j3: 🦮.\n\nSo, when I look at column2.\n\nrow0: 🐳; row1: 🦮; row2: 💧; row3: 🌕.\n\nNo runs.\n\nBut what about column1:\n\nrow0: 🌕; row1:💧; row2: 🌕; row3: 🐳.\n\nThus, checking for the pairs:\n\nrows 0 and 1: different.\n\nrows1 and2: 💧 vs 🌕: different.\n\nrows2 and3: 🌕 vs 🐳: different.\n\nSo no runs.\n\nWait, but then when row2, j0 is 🐳, and row3, it's 💧 again.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps in my initial analysis, I made a mistake counting all the possible vertical and horizontal lines. Are there any 2-len or 3-len lines I'm missing?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a vertical line from row2 to row3 in column3. Let's see:\n\nCell row2, j3=🐳, and row3,j3= 🦮: Different. So no.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing horizontal lines of 2 in some row.\n\nWait, looking again for any row with consecutive duplicates.\n\nRow0: No.\n\nRow1: No.\n\nRow2: j0=🐳, j1=🌕, j2=💧, j3=🐳 → j3 is same as j0, but in row. So, no for horizontal.\n\nRow3: No.\n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps am I considering horizontal and vertical only, but not both for the same emoji. Or maybe that other emojis are forming lines of longer than two.\n\nAnother Idea: perhaps some emojis have a run of three or four, in the same row or column, which I overlooked.\n\nBut in the board, none seems.\n\nAlternately, perhaps other columns:\n\nWait, column 0: row1 and row2 same.\n\ncolumns 1 has nothing same.\n\ncolumn3: what's cell (2,3)=🐳 and cell(3,3)=🦮.\n\nDifferent.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother Idea: perhaps the same emoji can form lines in multiple rows.\n\nBut Only if consecutive. So for example, three same in a column but not consecutive. Let me check.\n\nWait, column0: row0:💧, row1:🐳, row2:🐳, row3:💧. So between row1 and row2: same.\n\nBut row3 is 💧. So no.\n\nAnother Idea: perhaps looking for alternative interpretations, perhaps it's possible that ll's including all possible lines, including diagonals? But the problem states only horizontal or vertical.\n\nSo No.\n\nAnother Idea: Maybe some emoji in a row has a same in the end and elsewhere.\n\nFor example, let's see:\n\nIn row0, j0 and j3 are both 💧. But they aren't consecutive, so no line.\n\nRow2 has j0 and j3 as 🐳. So row2, j0-j3: no, as j1 is 🌕, j2 is💧, so not adjacent.\n\nThus, no horizontal lines.\n\nSo, according to my analysis, the answer is 1 line.\n\nBut perhaps I'm wrong, and the correct answer is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each occurrence of two same emojis in a row or column counts as a line, regardless of whether it's part of a longer line.\n\nIn that case, perhaps I missed some other runs.\n\nBut looking again:\n\ncolumn0, row1, row2: same → one line.\n\nIs there any other case?\n\ncolumn0, row0 and row3, the are same, but not consecutive.\n\nOther than that, is there another run of two in a row?\n\nLooking at column j for all j:\n\nYes, perhaps in column1, is there any two same in a row?\n\nRow0: 🌕, row1:💧 (different), row2:🌕 (same as row0), row3: 🐳 (different).\n\nSo between row0 and row2, not consecutive.\n\nNothing else.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, looking at row2, cell j0: 🐳, row3, j0:💧 → different.\n\nBut another looking: perhaps elsewhere.\n\nWait, I'm stumped. Until I can re-examine the board, perhaps I'll have to accept that my initial count is 1, but perhaps the correct answer is 5.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to note that, for example, some emojis appear in two in different lines.\n\nBut perhaps if the board had a horizontal line of two and a vertical of two, but in the same two cells, leading to overlap.\n\nBut in this case, it's only column0 with one vertical line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm considering only vertical lines, but perhaps each run is a line in itself, regardless of their direction, and I might find four lines. Or something.\n\nWait, no. Without further ideas, perhaps I proceed with the initial count.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more on the given 4x4 board.

{"board":[["🌙","🌙","🐨","🐋"],["🌼","🌼","🌙","🌼"],["🐋","🐨","🐋","🌙"],["🐨","🌼","🌙","🐋"]],"response":["<think>\nOkay, so I've got this problem where I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines on a board made up of emojis. Each line must be formed by the same emoji and have a length of at least 2. The board is 4x4, so I should examine each row and column carefully.\n\nLet me start by writing down the board so I can see it clearly. The board is as follows:\n\nRow 0: 🌙🌙🐨🐋\nRow 1: 🌼🌼🌙🌼\nRow 2: 🐋🐨🐋🌙\nRow 3: 🐨🌼🌙🐋\n\nI think I should check each row for consecutive emojis of the same type, and each column for the same.\n\nStarting with the rows.\n\nRow 0: 🌙🌙🐨🐋. Here, the first two are 🌙, so that's a line of length 2. Then the next two are 🐨 and 🐋, which are different, so no line. So row 0 has one line.\n\nRow 1: 🌼🌼🌙🌼. First two are 🌼, that's another line of length 2. The last three include 🌙 and two 🌼s, but they're not consecutive in a way to form a line beyond length 2. So row 1 has one line.\n\nRow 2: 🐋🐨🐋🌙. All alternating, so no two same in a row. So row 2 has none.\n\nRow 3: 🐨🌼🌙🐋. All different, so row 3 has none on horizontal.\n\nSo rows contribute 1 + 1 = 2 so far.\n\nNow checking columns for consecutive duplicates.\n\nLet me look column by column. Each column has four elements.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow0: 🌙\nRow1: 🌼\nRow2: 🐋\nRow3: 🐨\n\nAll different, so nothing here.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow0: 🌙\nRow1: 🌼\nRow2: 🐨\nRow3: 🌼\n\nHmm, row1 is 🌼, row3 is 🌼. Are they consecutive? Let's see:\n\nRow0: 🌙\nRow1: 🌼 (same as row3 but not immediately below. So row1 is 🌼, row2 is 🐨, row3 is 🌼. So no two in a column are same in a row. So no vertical lines here.\n\nWait, maybe I should index them properly. Let me number the rows and columns from 0 to 3.\n\nSo, Column 0 index 0: 🌙 (r0), r1: 🌼, r2: 🐋, r3: 🐨. No vertical lines.\n\nColumn 1: r0: 🌙; r1: 🌼; r2: 🐨; r3: 🌼.\n\nLooking for any two consecutive same. So in rows 0🌙, 1🌼, 2🐨, 3🌼. Are any of row0 and row1 same? No. Row1 and row2: 🌼 vs 🐨, no. Row2 and row3: 🐨 vs 🌼, no. So no vertical line in column 1.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nr0: 🐨\nr1: 🌙\nr2: 🐋\nr3: 🌙\n\nLooking for two in a row. Checking each pair:\n\nr0: 🐨 vs r1: 🌙 → different.\nr1: 🌙 vs r2: 🐋 → no.\nr2: 🐋 vs r3: 🌙 → no. So nothing here.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me recheck:\n\nColumn 2 has:\n\nRow0: 🐨\nRow1: 🌙\nRow2: 🐋\nRow3: 🌙\n\nAt row1 and row3, it's 🌙. But they're not consecutive. So no vertical line in column 2.\n\nColumn3:\n\nr0: 🐋\nr1: 🌼\nr2: 🌙\nr3: 🐋\n\nCheck each pair:\n\nr0: 🐋, r1: 🌼 → different.\nr1: 🌼, r2: 🌙 → no.\nr2: 🌙, r3: 🐋 → different.\nSo column3 has nothing.\n\nWait, no! Wait, column3:\n\nr0 🐋\nr1: 🌼\nSo r0 and r1: no. r1 and r2: 🌼 vs 🌙 → nope. r2 and r3: 🌙 vs 🐋. No. So column3 has no vertical lines.\n\nWait, wait. Did I make a mistake? Let me double-check columns. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nBack to column 1. Wait, row3 is 🌼. Row1 is 🌼. Are they in the same column? Yes, column1. But they are two rows apart, so they don't form a consecutive line. Only consecutive rows count. So any two same in consecutive rows form a line of length 2.\n\nWait, I might have miscounted columns. Let's go through each column again, looking for two or more in a vertical line.\n\nWait, column 0: all different. Column1: row0 🌙, row1 🌼, row2 🐨, row3 🌼. So looking for adjacent duplicates across the four rows. So for example, if row1 and row2 have same, or row2 and row3.\n\nIn column1:\n\nr1 and r2 (🌼, 🐨) → no.\n\nr2 and r3: 🐨, 🌼 → no.\n\nr0 and r1: 🌙, 🌼 → no.\n\nSo column1 has no lines longer than 1 vertically.\n\nNow, column2: all as before; nothing.\n\nColumn3: let's re-express:\n\nr0: 🐋\nr1: 🌼\nr2: 🌙\nr3: 🐋.\n\nNo consecutive duplicates.\n\nWait, wait something's off. Let me look again. Maybe in rows there are more.\n\nWait, the initial count in rows was two lines, one each in row0 and row1.\n\nAm I forgetting to look for longer lines? Because the problem is to count lines of length 2 or more. So each line is a group of consecutive same emojis in a row or column, of length 2 or more.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial analysis is correct, that only two. Alternatively, maybe I missed some.\n\nWait, looking again at rows:\n\nRow0: 🌙🌙🐨🐋 → two 🌙's. So that's one.\n\nRow1: 🌼🌼🌙🌼 → first two 🌼's. Then the last one is 🌼, but separate. So is the last one connected to previous?\n\nWait, the fourth element is 🌼, and the third is 🌙. So only the first two.\n\nSo, two lines so far.\n\nWait another moment: wait, perhaps the last 🌼 in row1 is connected to the third element? Or no, I think not. Because the third is 🌙, so the last cannot form a line except with the third if that's same thing, which it's not.\n\nSo row1 contributes one.\n\nWhat about column-wise? Do any columns have two same in a line?\n\nLet me check for that again.\n\nSo, column0:\n\nr0: 🌙\nr1: 🌼\nr2: 🐋\nr3: 🐨\n\nNo.\n\nColumn1:\n\nr0: 🌙\nr1: 🌼\nr2: 🐨\nr3: 🌼 → So looking down, the 🌼 is in row1 and row3. Are they adjacent? Row1's below r0, and row3 is two below row1. So, r1 and r2 have 🌼, 🐨, no. So nothing.\n\nWait, but perhaps a line can be longer than two?\n\nWait in the rows, perhaps there are. For example, are any rows having longer runs?\n\nRow0: two 🌙's → length 2.\n\nRow1: two 🌼's → length 2.\n\nSo nothing longer.\n\nWait, columns. Let's look for vertical lines.\n\nFor example, in column2:\n\nIs there any pair of same emojis in row1 and row2? Let's see:\n\nr0: 🐨\nr1: 🌙 → row1, column2 is 🌙\nr2: 🐋\nr3: 🌙.\n\nOops. So row1 and row3 in column2 are 🌙, but they're not adjacent. So row1 is 🌙, row2 is 🐋, row3 is 🌙.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, no. Wait, I'm confused. Let's think:\n\nColumn2 entries:\n\nRow 0: 🐨,\n\nRow1: 🌙,\n\nRow2: 🐋,\n\nRow3: 🌙.\n\nSo, in column2, row1 is 🌙 and row3 is 🌙.\n\nThey are two apart. So no consecutive duplicates, so nothing.\n\nSo, columns have zero lines. So the total is 2 lines.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me verify. Did I miss any vertical lines?\n\nAnother approach: maybe transposing the board and treating columns as rows.\n\nThe board's columns are:\n\nCol0: [🌙, 🌼, 🐋, 🐨]\n\nCol1: [🌙, 🌼, 🐨, 🌼]\n\nCol2: [🐨, 🌙, 🐋, 🌙]\n\nCol3: [🐋, 🌼, 🌙, 🐋]\n\nNow, treat each column as a row and check for runs.\n\nSo, for column0: the four elements are all different, so no run.\n\nColumn1:\n\nentry 0 (row0): 🌙, different from entry1 (🌼).\n\nSo, no.\n\nColumn2:\n\nEntries are 🐨, 🌙, 🐋, 🌙. Again, no two same in a row. So, no runs.\n\nColumn3:\n\nentries: 🐋, 🌼, 🌙, 🐋. Again, no runs.\n\nSo, no lines from columns. So total lines: 2.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in columns.\n\nWait, column1 in the original board is:\n\nIndexes r0-r3 as [🌙, 🌼, 🐨, 🌼]. So looking for any two same consecutive.\n\nr1: 🌼\n\nr3: 🌼. But there's r2 in between which isn't 🌼. So no consecutive, so no.\n\nSo columns don't contribute anything.\n\nSo I guess the final count is 2. But wait, another thought: am I considering lines as any group of same emojis in a line (like diagonally), but the question says horizontal OR vertical, so diagonals aren't counted. So no.\n\nBut wait, the board given might have another line.\n\nLet me re-look.\n\nWait, perhaps looking again at column3:\n\nEntries:\n\nrow0: 🐋,\n\nrow1: 🌼,\n\nrow2: 🌙,\n\nrow3: 🐋.\n\nSo no two same adjacent vertically.\n\nAnother column: column2: [🐨, 🌙, 🐋, 🌙]. Again, no same adjacent.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something in the rows. Let me go through each row again.\n\nRow0: 🌙🌙🐨🐋 → first two same: that's one.\n\nRow0's last two are 🐨 and 🐋: different. So row0 contributes +1.\n\nRow1: 🌼🌼🌙🌼. First two '🌼' → +1.\n\nThen, after 🌙, last is 🌼, which is different from 🌙. So only the first two count as a line.\n\nSo row1 contributes +1.\n\nRow2: 🐋🐨🐋🌙. No two same in a row.\n\nHmm, starting at first position: 🐋, 🐨 → different. Next, 🐨 and 🐋 → different. Then 🐋 and 🌙 → different.\n\nRow3: 🐨🌼🌙🐋. All different; no lines.\n\nWait, but wait... what about if a row has a run of 3 or 4? Like if there's a line that's longer than 2, it still counts as one, right?\n\nBut in this case, we don't have any such rows. So the count from rows is two.\n\nWhat about columns? Did I miss any in columns again?\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps some columns have two consecutive same emojis somewhere.\n\nFor example, column3:\n\nRow0: 🐋\n\nRow1: 🌼\n\nRow2: 🌙\n\nRow3: 🐋\n\nWait, none.\n\nBut perhaps looking elsewhere:\n\nLooking at column0 again:\n\nRow0: 🌙\n\nRow1: 🌼\n\nRow2: 🐋\n\nRow3: 🐨\n\nNo.\n\nWait, row1: 🌼🌼🌙🌼. So, after the two 🌼, next comes 🌙. But the fourth is 🌼, which might not make a line beyond the first two.\n\nWait, could there be another run in a row? For example, in row1, after the first two, is there another run?\n\nNo, because the third is different, and the fourth alone doesn't make a group of 2.\n\nSo row1 has one run of two.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nI think so. So sum from rows is two (1 in row0, one in row1).\n\nSo the total count is two.\n\nWait, but wait—new discovery? Let me look again, because sometimes it's the little mistakes that cost us.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm right. So total lines is two.\n\nWait, wait a second. Looking at row0 again:\n\n🌙🌙🐨🐋: first two same → +1.\n\nBut, perhaps the 🐨 and 🐋 could form a run if followed by another, but they're in row0. So that's it for row0.\n\nWhat about row1: 🌼🌼🌙🌼. So the last one is 🌼, but the previous is 🌙, so it doesn’t.\n\nTherefore, sum should be 2.\n\nSo the answer should be 2.\n<\/think>\n\nThe task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines on a 4x4 emoji board where each line consists of the same emoji with a length of 2 or more.

Each line must consist of the same emoji and be at least 2 long. Hmm. Let's see. The board is given as a grid, and I guess each line can either be horizontal (left to right) or vertical (top to bottom).\n\nFirst, I should probably visualize the board. Let me write it out based on the input:\n\nRow 1: 🐄 🐄 🦥 🐄  \nRow 2: 🐗 🐄 🐄 🐶  \nRow 3: 🐶 🐄 🐗 🐄  \nRow 4: 🐶 🐄 🐄 🐗  \n\nWait, are the rows 4x4? Yeah, four rows and each row has four elements, so it's a 4x4 grid.\n\nI need to check each row for horizontal lines and each column for vertical lines. For each line segment of same emojis, as long as it's two or longer, count it. But wait, do overlapping lines count multiple times? Like, if in a row, I have three same emojis. That makes two lines of two each, plus one line of three? Because the count is for all possible consecutive segments of length ≥2.\n\nWait, no—the counts should be for the maximum possible lines. Wait, the problem might just be asking for distinct runs where the same emoji appears consecutively either horizontally or vertically, and each run is counted once if it's two or more. Or maybe each separate run, regardless of length beyond 2.\n\nWait, I think the problem is to count each maximal run of same emojis, whether horizontal or vertical, as long as it's length is ≥2. So, for example, a run of 3 same emojis in a horizontal row would count as 1 towards the total because it's a single continuous line of 3.\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement: \"the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So each such line is a maximal run. So, in a row with three same emojis, that's a single line of length 3, so that's one line. Similarly, if a row has two separate runs of two same emojis, that's two lines.\n\nWait, but the example I'm thinking about—let me clarify. Let's consider a row like A A A B B. So, the first three are A's, which makes a horizontal line of length 3. Then two B's, that's a line of length 2. So that contributes 2 lines in that row.\n\nSo, the plan is: for each row, scan for consecutive same emojis, and for each such maximal run, if it's at least 2 in length, count one. Then do the same for each column. Sum all those counts for the total.\n\nAlright, let's go step by step.\n\nFirst, processing the rows.\n\nRow 1: 🐄 🐄 🦥 🐄\nRow 2: 🐗 🐄 🐄 🐶\nRow 3: 🐶 🐄 🐗 🐄\nRow 4: 🐶 🐄 🐄 🐗\n\nStart by looking at each row.\n\nRow 1: 🐄 🐄. So two 🐄's. So that's a run of length 2. Then comes 🦥, so the run ends. Then another 🐄. So in row 1, how many runs are ≥2? There's one run of two 🐄s. So row 1 contributes 1.\n\nRow 2: 🐗, then 🐄 🐄, that's a run of 2. So row 2: 1.\n\nRow 3: 🐶 followed by 🐄. Not a run. Because 🐄 is single now. Or wait, the next is 🐗? Wait row 3 is 🐶 🐄 🐗 🐄. So let's go step by step.\n\nIn row 3, positions are:\n\n1: 🐶\n2: 🐄\n3: 🐗\n4: 🐄\n\nSo no consecutive duplicates. So row 3 contributes 0.\n\nRow 4: 🐶, then 🐄 🐄, so a run of 2. So row 4 has 1.\n\nNow, the rows contribute 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3.\n\nNow, onto the columns. Each column is made of the same position in each row. Let's list the columns:\n\nColumn 1: \nRow 1: 🐄\nRow 2: 🐗\nRow 3: 🐶\nRow 4: 🐶\n\nSo the entries are 🐄, 🐗, 🐶, 🐶.\n\nLooking for consecutive duplicates? Wait, vertical runs are consecutive same emojis in the column direction.\n\nSo in column 1:\n\nPositions 3 and 4 are 🐶 and 🐶. So that's a vertical run of length 2. So column 1 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 2: \n\nRow 1: 🐄\nRow 2: 🐄\nRow 3: 🐄\nRow 4: 🐄\n\nSo in column 2: 🐄, 🐄, 🐄, 🐄.\n\nWait, all four are 🐄s! So the entire column is one vertical run of length 4, which counts as 1. So column 2 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow 1: 🦥\nRow 2: 🐄\nRow 3: 🐗\nRow 4: 🐄\n\nThese are all different except, no. 🦥, 🐄, 🐗, 🐄. So no run of 2. So column3 contributes 0.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow1: 🐄\nRow2: 🐶\nRow3: 🐄\nRow4: 🐗\n\nAll different: 🐄, 🐶, 🐄, 🐗. No runs.\n\nSo columns contribute: column1 (1) + column2 (1) = 2.\n\nWait, because column2 is a single run of 4 same, so contributes one.\n\nSo the total is rows (3) + columns (2) = 5.\n\nWait, wait. Let me recount. Rows contribute 3: rows 1,2,4 each have one run, row 3 has none. Columns: columns 1 and 2 each contribute 1 run. So 3 + 2 =5.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me reprocess the columns.\n\nColumn1: row3 and row4 are 🐶.\n\nSo positions 3 and 4 are 🐶. So that's a run starting at row3 and going down for 2. So yes, count 1.\n\nColumn2: all four are 🐄, so entire length, so that's one run, count 1.\n\nSo total of 2.\n\nYes, rows: 3, columns: 2, total 5.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the column1 is four rows. Row1 is 🐄, row2: 🐗, row3: 🐶, row4: 🐶. So looking for consecutive emojis same vertically.\n\nRow3 and row4: same, so that's a run of 2—so column1 contributes 1.\n\nThen, column2: entire column is same. So that's one run of 4: so contributes 1.\n\nOthers: columns3 and 4 have no runs.\n\nThus, correct, columns contribute 1 +1 = 2.\n\nSo adding rows (3) and columns (2) gives 5.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I miss any runs in the rows?\n\nRow 1: two 🐄, so yes. So that's one.\n\nRow 2: two 🐄, so one.\n\nWait, wait row2: I think it's 🐗 then 🐄 🐄. So yes, one run.\n\nRow4: 🐄 🐄, so yes, one run.\n\nRows: yes, 3. Correct.\n\nBut wait, is there any cell that is part of both a horizontal and vertical line? For example, the 🐄s in row2, column2 are part of the vertical column2 run. But the run in row2, they're also part of a horizontal run.\n\nBut in our counting, each run in the row and column is considered separately. So if there's a cell that's part of a horizontal line and a vertical line, each line will be counted as separate, provided their respective runs meet the condition.\n\nOkay, so that's acceptable. Now, let me think if I missed any runs.\n\nHold on, maybe I missed something. Let me double-check the rows.\n\nReview each row:\n\nRow1: cells are 🐄, 🐄, 🦥, 🐄.\n\n- Columns 1 and 2 are 🐄, 🐄. So that's a run of 2. So 1.\n\nRow2: 🐗, 🐄, 🐄, 🐶.\n\n- Columns 2 and 3 are 🐄, 🐄. So that's 1.\n\nRow3: 🐶, 🐄, 🐗, 🐄.\n\nAll single so no runs.\n\nRow4: 🐶, 🐄, 🐄, 🐗.\n\n- Columns 2 and 3 are 🐄, 🐄. So that counts as 1.\n\nSo total 3 in rows. Correct.\n\nColumns:\n\ncol1: rows3 and 4: 🐶, so 1.\n\ncol2: all four 🐄, so 1.\n\nso columns 2.\n\nI also had this correct.\n\nThus, total is 3 + 2 =5.\n\nHmm, that's the conclusion I come to.\n\nWait another thing: perhaps in column3. Wait, row2's column3 is 🐄, but row1's column3 is 🦥. No run.\n\nAnother thing: in column4, row1 is 🐄. Then row2: 🐶, row3:🐄, row4:🐗. Not same as any adjacent.\n\nHmm. Oh wait, wait. For column4, row1 and row3 are 🐄 each, but they are not adjacent (row2 is🐶). So no vertical run here.\n\nThus, only columns1 and 2 have runs.\n\nWait, another thing: in row2, there's a run of two🐄 horizontally, but also some 🐄s are part of the vertical run in column2. But that's fine, they're different lines, so no double-counting.\n\nWait, vertical column2 is 4 same, but horizontal in row2 is a separate run. So that's correct to count both.\n\nSo I think the answer is 5. So total number of such lines is 5.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more, on a 4x4 grid.

{"board":[["🦃","🦐","🦐","🦃"],["🦃","🦃","🐥","🦐"],["🐥","🐥","🐥","🐥"],["🐥","🦃","🐥","🦐"]],"response":["<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to solve this problem where I have to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines on a rectangular board made of emojis. Each line should consist of the same emoji and have a length of at least 2. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the board provided. The board is given as four rows, each with four emojis. Let me write them down for clarity.\n\nRow 1: 🦃, 🦐, 🦐, 🦃\nRow 2: 🦃, 🦃, 🐥, 🦐\nRow 3: 🐥, 🐥, 🐥, 🐥\nRow 4: 🐥, 🦃, 🐥, 🦐\n\nSo each row has four elements. I guess each row is separated by a newline, but I'll treat each line as a separate row in my analysis.\n\nNow, I need to check each row for horizontal lines—consecutive same emojis, length 2 or more. Then I'll do the same for each column to check vertical lines.\n\nStarting with horizontal lines. For each row, I'll go through each position and see if the next (or next few) emojis are the same, adding to the count as necessary.\n\nRow 1: 🦃, 🦐, 🦐, 🦃\n- Position 1: 🦃 followed by 🦐 (different)\n- Position 2: 🦐 next is 🦐, so that's a line of length 2. So that's 1 count.\nRow 2: 🦃, 🦃, 🐥, 🦐\n- Position 1: 🦃 next 🦃, so line of 2 (count 1)\nRow 3: 🐥 *4 in a row. So there are lines of 2, 3, and 4? Wait, no. I think line segments are counted as any continuous 2 or more. So a row of four same emojis has three segments. Wait no, no. For example, in a row of 4 same emojis, how many lines are there? Let's think: lines of 2, lines of 3, and a line of 4? Or is it that each possible consecutive 2 or more counts as a line. Alternatively, maybe each maximal run is considered once. This point is crucial.\n\nWait, the question states \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So each line is a maximal run. So in a row of four same emojis, it's considered a single line of length 4, contributing one count. Because if I take each possible substring, like 2,3,4, that's overcounting.\n\nWait no: Let me clarify. For example, if a row has 🦐🦐🦐🦐, then across this row, how many horizontal lines do we have?\n\nEach individual line should be a line of 4, but according to the problem statement, is that considered as one line or multiple? Because the wording isn't clear on this. Hmm.\n\nThe problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with length of 2 or more.\" So perhaps each continuous sequence of 2 or more counts as one line. So in the row 🐥🐥🐥🐥, it's four in a line. So that's one line of length 4.\n\nWait, but in row 3, the entire row is the same. So regardless of the length beyond 4, it's still one horizontal line.\n\nSo back to row 3:\n\nIn row 3, the entire row is of 🐥🐥🐥🐥. Hence, that's a single horizontal line of length 4. So one count.\n\nWait but let me think again. Maybe each consecutive pair is a line of 2. So for row 3, you have 3 lines of 2, and 2 lines of 3, etc. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is counting 'lines formed' by the same emoji in a row or column.\n\nWait the problem is ambiguous. But perhaps it's looking for the total number of maximal runs. So each maximal run is a single line. So a run of n same emojis (n >=2) counts as a single line, regardless of how long it is beyond 2.\n\nSo, for example, in row 3, the four 🐥 are one line because it's the longest possible in that row.\n\nBut wait, if that's the case, then for each row, each run of >=2 same emojis counts as a single line.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the sample input.\n\nIn row 1: 🦃🦐🦐🦃. So in this row, positions 2-3 are same (🦐), so that's one horizontal line.\n\nAlso, position 4 is 🦃, but the previous is 🦐, so no.\n\nSo row 1 contributes 1 horizontal line.\n\nIn row 2: 🦃🦃🐥🦐. Positions 1-2 are 🦃, so that's another line—another count.\n\nIn row 3: entire row same, so 1 count.\n\nIn row 4: 🐥🦃🐥🦐. Looking for horizontal lines. Each emoji is unique except for position 1 is 🐥, which is followed by 🦃, different. So no horizontal lines in row 4.\n\nSo, horizontally, we have 1 (row 1) +1 (row2) +1 (row3) = 3 lines.\n\nNow for vertical lines: For each column, let's look for runs of same emojis, length >=2.\n\nThe board has four columns. Each column has 4 emojis.\n\nLet's go column by column.\n\nColumn 1: [🦃, 🦃, 🐥, 🐥]\n\nLooking for runs:\n\nPosition 1: 🦃, position 2: 🦃. Same? Yes. So that's a vertical line length 2.\n\nThen position 3 is 🐥, which is different. Next is 🐥 (position 4 same as 3). So another vertical line starting at 3, which is a run of 2.\n\nSo column 1 has two vertical lines.\n\nColumn 2: [🦐, 🦃, 🐥, 🦃]\n\nLooking for runs:\n\nPosition 1: 🦐, position 2: 🦃 (different). No run.\n\nPosition 2: 🦃, then 🐥 (pos 3): differ. No.\n\nPosition 3: 🐥, position 4 is 🦃: differ. So no vertical lines here.\n\nWait wait, let me look again. Column 2:\n\nRow 1: 🦐\n\nRow 2: 🦃\n\nRow3: 🐥\n\nRow4: 🦃\n\nSo no two in a row are same. Same check: each consecutive positions differ. So column 2 has no vertical lines.\n\nColumn3: [🦐, 🐥, 🐥, 🐥]\n\nWait no. Let me re-examine. The columns are made of each row's elements, so column 3 is:\n\nRow1: third element is 🦐.\n\nRow2: third is 🐥\n\nRow3: third is 🐥\n\nRow4: third element is 🐥\n\nSo:\n\nPositions 1 (🦐), 2 (🐥) — different.\n\nPositions 2,3: both 🐥 — same. So that's a run of 2.\n\nPositions 3,4: 🐥, same. So is that another run, or is it a longer run?\n\nWait, the run starts at position 2–3–4. So positions 2,3,4 are all 🐥. So that's a single run of length 3 for that column. So in column3, at positions 2,3,4, same: hence, a single vertical line of length 3. So that counts as 1 line in column 3.\n\nSo column3 has 1 vertical line.\n\nWait, is that correct? So column3 is:\n\nRow1: ?, 🦐, (probably I have the rows as 1,2,3,4 and columns 1,2,3,4. Let me make a table.\n\nAnother approach is to represent the board as rows: each row is R1 to R4, each with 4 elements, C1 to C4.\n\nSo,\n\nC1  C2  C3  C4\n\nR1: 🦃 🦐 🦐 🦃\n\nR2: 🦃 🦃 🐥 🦐\n\nR3: 🐥 🐥 🐥 🐥\n\nR4: 🐥 🦃 🐥 🦐\n\nSo column1 is R1C1, R2C1, R3C1, R4C1:\n\nR1C1: 🦃, R2C1: 🦃, R3C1: 🐥, R4C1: 🐥.\n\nSo for column1, rows1 and 2 are same: 🦃🦃, so vertical line of length 2. Rows3 and4: 🐥🐥, another vertical line of length 2. So column1 has two vertical lines.\n\nColumn3: R1C3 is 🦐, R2C3 is 🐥, R3C3 is 🐥, R4C3 is 🐥. So looking for runs.\n\nAt R1: 🦐 vs R2 🐥: no.\n\nR2 (🐥) and R3 (🐥): same. R3 and R4 (🐥): same. So from R2 to R4-- a run of 3 in column3. So that's a single vertical line.\n\nSo column3 contributes 1.\n\nColumn4:\n\nR1C4: 🦃\n\nR2C4: 🦐\n\nR3C4: 🐥\n\nR4C4: 🦐\n\nLooking for runs. Each consecutive pair is different. So no vertical lines.\n\nWait, column4: from row3 to row4: 🐥, 🦐? Different. So no runs.\n\nSo, in columns:\n\nColumn1: 2 vertical lines.\n\nColumn2: 0.\n\nColumn3:1.\n\nColumn4:0.\n\nSo total vertical lines: 3.\n\nWait adding them up: 2+0+1+0=3.\n\nWait, no, wait:\n\nWait I thought in column1 there are two lines. So initial count:\n\nColumn1: 2 vertical lines.\n\nDidn't I say that column1 has two: one of length 2 (rows 1-2) and another of length 2 (rows3-4)?\n\nSo that's 2 in column1.\n\nSo vertical lines: 2 (column1) + 1 (column3) = 3.\n\nSo total vertical lines:3.\n\nPreviously, horizontal lines were 3.\n\nSo total lines: 3 horizontal +3 vertical =6.\n\nWait, but let me recount.\n\nHorizontal lines:\n\nRow1: 1 (positions2-3).\n\nRow2:1 (positions1-2).\n\nRow3:1 (entire row 4, which is length 4).\n\nWait no.\n\nWait in row3, the entire row is four same. So that's a single horizontal line of length 4, one count.\n\nSo total horizontal lines: 3.\n\nVertical lines: column1 has two (rows1-2 same, rows3-4 same), which is two lines.\n\ncolumn3 has one line (rows2-3-4: length 3).\n\nSo 2+1=3.\n\nSo total lines are 3+3=6.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me make a thorough check of all cells.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let's look for each possible run.\n\nHorizontal lines:\n\nRow1: 🦃 and then 🦐, which is different. Next two are 🦐🦐, so that's a line of 2, count 1.\n\nRow2: 🦃🦃, so count 1.\n\nRow3: count 1.\n\nRow4: all unique except perhaps no.\n\nTotal horizontal lines:3.\n\nNow for vertical:\n\nLooking at each column:\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow1-2: 🦃🦃, count 1.\n\nRow3-4: 🐥🐥, count another 1.\n\nSo column1 yields 2.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow2-3-4: 🐥🐥🐥. That's one vertical line.\n\nNo more.\n\nOther columns: nothing.\n\nSo vertical lines: 2 (column1) +1 (column3) =3.\n\nSo total 3+3=6.\n\nSo the answer should be 6.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji on a rectangular board, where each line has a length of 2 or more.

{"board":[["⛅️","⛅️","🌾","🦚"],["🐊","🌾","🦚","🌾"],["🐊","⛅️","🐊","🐊"],["⛅️","⛅️","⛅️","🌾"]],"response":["<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve this game problem where I have to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines of the same emoji with a length of 2 or more on a rectangular board. Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I think I should look at the board provided. The board is made up of four rows, each containing four emojis. Let me write them out clearly to visualize:\n\nRow 1: ⛅️⛅️🌾🦚\nRow 2: 🐊🌾🦚🌾\nRow 3: 🐊⛅️🐊🐊\nRow 4: ⛅️⛅️⛅️🌾\n\nAlright, the goal is to count lines that are either horizontal or vertical. Each line must consist of the same emoji, and be at least length 2. So lines can be 2, 3, or 4 in length. For each such line, I need to count one occurrence.\n\nWait, but when counting, do overlapping occurrences count separately? Like if I have a row of four same emojis, that's a line of 4, but I think in this problem, each contiguous line of the same emoji counts as one, regardless of how long it is. So a line of length 4 would contribute +1 to the count, not separate counts for the substrings within it. Or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question? Let me re-read.\n\nWait, the problem statement says to count the number of lines formed with 'a length of 2 or more.' So each line is counted once. So if a row has four same emojis, that's one line of length 4, which we include once. So for that row, we add 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of any consecutive same emojis in a row or column as a single line if it's 2 or longer. So for example, in row 1: two ⛅️s, then a different emoji, so one line. Then the next two are different, so no. So row 1 contributes one line.\n\nWait, but I should also consider vertical lines. I need to check columns as well.\n\nLet me approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll handle horizontal lines. For each row, I'll scan each position and note consecutive same emojis, and for each contiguous block of the same emoji of length >=2, I'll count it as one.\n\nFor row 1: ⛅️⛅️ | 🌾 | 🦚\n\nSo two ⛅️s, count as 1 line. Then the rest are single, so nothing else. So row 1 has 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow 2: 🐊 | 🌾 | 🦚 | 🌾\n\nAll are single, so no lines here.\n\nRow 3: 🐊 | ⛅️ | 🐊🐊\n\nSo the first is single, then ⛅️ single, then two 🐊s. So row 3 has 1 line.\n\nRow 4: ⛅️⛅️⛅️ | 🌾\n\nThree ⛅️s, which counts as 1 line.\n\nNow, the problem also considers vertical lines. So I need to check each column and look for consecutive same emojis in the vertical direction.\n\nSo for each column, I'll check from top to bottom, looking for consecutive same emojis of length >=2.\n\nLet me index the columns as 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nLooking at column 1:\n\nRow1: ⛅️\nRow2: 🐊\nRow3: 🐊\nRow4: ⛅️\n\nLooking for vertical sequences. Row1 is ⛅️, Row2 is 🐊: different. Row3 is same as Row2 🐊? Yes. So from Row2 to Row3, that's two 🐊s. So that's one vertical line. Is there a longer line in this column? Let me see: row3 is 🐊 and row4 is ⛅️: different. So only one vertical line in column 1.\n\nWait, wait: column 1 row2 is 🐊, row3 is 🐊. So that's two in a row, so one line. Then, any longer? No, because row4 is different.\n\nSo column 1 contributes 1 line.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow1: ⛅️?\nWait wait, better to get each column correctly:\n\nWait let me list each row and their emojis properly, maybe numbered 1 to 4 for columns:\n\nRow 1: col1=⛅️, col2=⛅️, col3=🌾, col4=🦚\nRow 2: col1=🐊, col2=🌾, col3=🦚, col4=🌾\nRow 3: col1=🐊, col2=⛅️, col3=🐊, col4=🐊\nRow 4: col1=⛅️, col2=⛅️, col3=⛅️, col4=🌾\n\nOkay, so Column 2:\n\nRow1: ⛅️\nRow2: 🌾\nRow3: ⛅️\nRow4: ⛅️\n\nLooking for sequences descending. Let's go row by row.\n\nBetween Row1 and Row2: different, no line.\nRow2 to Row3: 🌾 vs ⛅️, no.\nRow3 to Row4: same ⛅️. So Row3 and Row4 in column 2 have two same, which counts as a line. So that's one line.\n\nSo column2: 1 line.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow1: 🌾\nRow2: 🦚\nRow3: 🐊\nRow4: ⛅️.\n\nAll are different. So no vertical lines.\n\nBut wait, let me check again:\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow1: 🌾\nRow2: 🦚 (different from above)\nRow3: 🐊 (different from above)\nRow4: ⛅️ (different).\n\nNo consecutive same, so nothing here.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow1: 🦚\nRow2: 🌾\nRow3: 🐊\nRow4: 🌾\n\nCheck each pair:\n\nRow1-Row2: different.\nRow2-Row3: 🌾 vs 🐊, different.\nRow3-Row4: 🐊 vs 🌾, different. So no lines in column4.\n\nWait, but what about column4's Row2 and Row4? Are they the same? Wait, row2, column4 is 🌾, row4, column4 is 🌾. So row2 and row4 in column4 are same, but they are not consecutive. So since row3's column4 is 🐊, so the two 🌾s are not consecutive. So no line.\n\nSo vertical lines: column1 has 1, column2 has 1, others none. Total vertical lines: 2.\n\nWait, no, wait, earlier I thought column2 has one line at row3 and 4.\n\nWait column1 had a line from row2 to row3 (🐊), that's one line.\n\nSo vertical lines contribute 2 lines (column1 and column2), horizontal lines we had 3 (rows 1,3,4 each contributing 1).\n\nSo total lines would be 3 (horizontal) + 2 (vertical) = 5? Hmm, but wait I need to recount to make sure I'm not missing any.\n\nWait, let me redo the horizontal counts more carefully.\n\nLooking again at each row:\n\nRow 1: symbols ⛅️, ⛅️, 🌾, 🦚.\n\nFrom left to right, the first two are same, so that's a horizontal line, length 2: count as 1.\n\nThe next two are different, so nothing. So row1: 1 line.\n\nRow2: 🐊, 🌾, 🦚, 🌾.\n\nAll single, so 0.\n\nRow3: 🐊, ⛅️, 🐊, 🐊.\n\nLooking at first symbol: single. Then ⛅️. Then, 🐊, 🐊: that's two in a row, so that's another line, length 2: count 1.\n\nRow4: ⛅️, ⛅️, ⛅️, 🌾.\n\nFirst three are same: that's a line of length3: count 1.\n\nSo horizontal total: 1 (row1) + 0 (row2) +1(row3) +1 (row4) = 3.\n\nVertical:\n\nColumn1: from row2 to row3, two 🐊s: one line.\n\nColumn2: from row3 to row4, two ⛅️s: one line.\n\nColumns3 and 4: none.\n\nSo vertical total: 2.\n\nWait, but another possibility: in column3, row3 and row4: 🐊 vs ⛅️? No, no match.\n\nWait, in column1, only row2 and 3 are same. So 1 contribution.\n\nIn column2: rows 3 and 4 same as each other: 1.\n\nNo other columns contribute. So vertical is 2 lines.\n\nSo total lines: 3 horizontal +2 vertical=5.\n\nBut wait, wait a minute, maybe I'm missing something in the vertical checks.\n\nWait, let me re-examine each vertical column.\n\nFor column1:\n\nRow1: ⛅️\n\nRow2: 🐊\n\nRow3: 🐊\n\nRow4: ⛅️\n\nSo looking for consecutive:\n\nRow2 and 3 are same: length 2 = 1 line.\n\nNow, let's see, is there another line in column1? For example, does row3 have the same as row4? No, row3 is 🐊, row4 is ⛅️, so no.\n\nAnother line: how about row4 and row ... Well, no, it's the last row. So only 1 line in column1.\n\nNow, column2:\n\nRow1: ⛅️\n\nRow2: 🌾\n\nRow3: ⛅️\n\nRow4: ⛅️.\n\nNow, row3 and 4: both ⛅️. So that's one line.\n\nIs there any other consecutive same in column2?\n\nRow1 is ⛅️, row2 is 🌾: different. Row2 to 3: different. Only row3 and 4 contribute.\n\nSo column2: 1 line.\n\nThus, 3 horizontal and 2 vertical lines sum to 5. So the total would be 5.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. I might have missed some lines.\n\nWait, in row4: three ⛅️s. That counts as one horizontal line.\n\nIn row1: two ⛅️: counts as one.\n\nIn row3: two 🐊s at the end: one.\n\nSo no more horizontal lines.\n\nCheck vertical lines again.\n\nLooking at vertical:\n\nColumn1:\n\nRows 2 and 3: 🐊🐊 -> 1 line.\n\nNo other lines.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRows3 and4: columns ⛅️⛅️ -> 1 line.\n\nNo other lines.\n\nOther columns contribute nothing.\n\nSo that's two vertical lines.\n\nSo total is 3 + 2 =5.\n\nWait, but another thought: maybe the vertical lines can be longer if they have the same emojis.\n\nWait, in column2, row3 and row4 are both ⛅️, but what about row0 (no such row) above row1? So no.\n\nSo no, nothing beyond.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps I'm forgetting that when you have a longer line, it also includes smaller lines. But no, the problem says lines, so the entire contiguous block counts as one as long as it's >=2. So even if there are smaller blocks within a longer one, the count is for the entire block as one.\n\nWait, but I need to ensure that any consecutive same emojis in a line is counted as one. So for example, if a row has four same emojis, that's one line; you don't count it as three lines of length 2 or whatever.\n\nWait the problem says \"number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So each maximal contiguous line of same emojis >=2 counts as one, regardless of its length.\n\nSo a line of 3 would be 1 line, same as a line of 2.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nSo now, adding the horizontal (3) and vertical (2) lines, gives 5 total lines.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake. Because in column4:\n\nRow2: 🌾\n\nRow4: 🌾\n\nWait, row2 and row4 in column4 are both 🌾, but are they consecutive? So the positions are row2, column4, and row4, column4.\n\nSo that's not consecutive because row3, column4 is 🐊. So they are separated by a different emoji.\n\nWait no, so they're not in a row vertically. So not consecutive. Therefore, that does not form a vertical line.\n\nAnother thing to check: perhaps in column1, rows3 and 4: 🐊 and ⛅️ are different. So no.\n\nWait, just to make sure, another approach could be to use code, but since I can't code here, I'll go step by step.\n\nWait, wait. Counting all possible lines of at least two in any direction.\n\nWait, adding the horizontal and vertical lines separately gives 5.\n\nBut perhaps I'm missing some longer lines in other directions.\n\nWait, let me look again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in column3, looking at row3 and row4: the third column in row3 is 🐊, and row4 is ⛅️, which are different. So nothing.\n\nWait, another thing: perhaps I missed a line that starts in one row and continues into another. Wait no, that's only possible in vertical direction.\n\nSo for each column, I need to scan top to bottom and see any two in a row.\n\nOkay, perhaps I have covered all cases.\n\nSo the total count would be 5.\n\nWait, but wait:\n\nAnother approach is to list all lines:\n\nHorizontally:\n\nRow1: ⛅️⛅️ (1 line).\n\nRow3: 🐊🐊 (1).\n\nRow4: ⛅️⛅️⛅️ (1).\n\nVertically:\n\nColumn1: 🐊🐊 (1).\n\nColumn2: ⛅️⛅️ (1).\n\nSo that's 1+1+1 (horizontal) =3, and 2 vertical, total 5.\n\nSo the answer should be 5.\n\nWait, but I just thought of row2: does it have any vertical lines in any columns?\n\nWait row2, column4 is 🌾. Does it pair with any in the same column?\n\nRow2, column4 is 🌾, row4 is also 🌾, but separated by row3's 🐊. So not consecutive, so no line.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I should consider both horizontal and vertical, but I think that's what I did.\n\nSo I think 5 is the correct answer.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more, on a 4x4 rectangular board. Each contiguous block of the same emoji, regardless of its length (as long as it is ≥2), counts as one line.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### Horizontal Lines:\n1. **Row 1**: `⛅️⛅️🌾🦚`  \n   - The first two emojis (`⛅️⛅️`) form a horizontal line of length 2.  \n   - **Count**: 1 line.  \n\n2. **Row 2**: `🐊🌾🦚🌾`  \n   - All emojis are different.  \n   - **Count**: 0 lines.  \n\n3. **Row 3**: `🐊⛅️🐊🐊`  \n   - The last two emojis (`🐊🐊`) form a horizontal line of length 2.  \n   - **Count**: 1 line.  \n\n4. **Row 4**: `⛅️⛅️⛅️🌾`  \n   - The first three emojis (`⛅️⛅️⛅️`) form a horizontal line of length 3.  \n   - **Count**: 1 line.  \n\n   **Total Horizontal Lines**: 3.\n\n#### Vertical Lines:\n1. **Column 1**:  \n   - `⛅️` (Row 1), `🐊` (Row 2), `🐊` (Row 3), `⛅️` (Row 4).  \n   - Rows 2 and 3 (`🐊🐊`) form a vertical line of length 2.  \n   - **Count**: 1 line.  \n\n2. **Column 2**:  \n   - `⛅️` (Row 1), `🌾` (Row 2), `⛅️` (Row 3), `⛅️` (Row 4).  \n   - Rows 3 and 4 (`⛅️⛅️`) form a vertical line of length 2.  \n   - **Count**: 1 line.  \n\n3. **Column 3**:  \n   - `🌾` (Row 1), `🦚` (Row 2), `🐊` (Row 3), `⛅️` (Row 4).  \n   - All emojis are different.  \n   - **Count**: 0 lines.  \n\n4. **Column 4**:  \n   - `🦚` (Row 1), `🌾` (Row 2), `🐊` (Row 3), `🌾` (Row 4).  \n   - No two consecutive emojis are the same.  \n   - **Count**: 0 lines.  \n\n   **Total Vertical Lines**: 2.\n\n### Final Count:\n- **Horizontal Lines**: 3  \n- **Vertical Lines**: 2  \n- **Total Lines**: \\(3 + 2 = 5\\).\n\nAnswer: 5"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

{"board":[["🌙","🧽","🌷","🌷"],["🌱","🧽","🌙","🌷"],["🌱","🌙","🧽","🌱"],["🌙","🌷","🧽","🌱"]],"response":["<think>\nOkay, so I've got this problem where I'm given a 4x4 board made up of emojis. My task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with each line being at least 2 units long. Hmm, I need to think carefully about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the board. Let me write it down as a grid:\n\nRow 0: 🌙 🧽 🌷 🌷\nRow 1: 🌱 🧽 🌙 🌷\nRow 2: 🌱 🌙 🧽 🌱\nRow 3: 🌙 🌷 🧽 🌱\n\nWait, maybe I should number the rows starting from 0 to make it easier when I think in terms of indexes.\n\nNow, I need to look for consecutive identical emojis either horizontally (same row, adjacent columns) or vertically (same column, adjacent rows). Each such line must be of length 2 or more. Also, each cell can be part of multiple lines—like if there's a line of 3 same emojis, it includes two lines of length 2 and one of length 3. Wait, no, wait—that's something to think about. Or does each consecutive pair count as a line, so longer lines are counted as multiple lines. Hmm, the question says lines with length 2 or more, so each possible consecutive group of 2 or more in direction.\n\nWait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more.\" So for each possible consecutive sequence (horizontal or vertical) of 2 or more same emojis, count each such occurrence once. Like for a row of 3 same emojis, there are two different lines of length 2 and one line of length 3. Or wait, maybe a line is a maximal sequence. Wait, perhaps it's better to think about it as the number of maximal lines. Or maybe each individual consecutive pair counts as a line, but that could complicate things when they are part of longer lines.\n\nWait, the question is ambiguous. Looking back, the wording says lines with \"a length of 2 or more\". So perhaps the approach is to scan each row and column, and for each possible starting point, check how far the same emoji continues, and then count how many sequences of 2 or more exist within a line, considering overlaps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to count how many horizontal or vertical lines in which all the cells are the same, and the line has length at least 2. But that's probably not what the problem says. Because a line is a single straight continuation—so for example, in row 0, the last two cells are both 🌷, that's a line of length 2. Similarly, in row 0, starting at column 2, a line of 2, but if column 3 is same, then it would count as one line of length 2. Wait, but row 0 has two consecutive 🌷s. Wait, at columns 2 and 3, yes.\n\nLet me take it step by step. For each row, go through each cell and check in the horizontal (right) and vertical (down) directions for the same emoji, and for how long. Then count each such sequence as a line if its length is at least 2.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to scan each row for horizontal lines and each column for vertical lines. For each cell, look to the right to see how long a consecutive sequence of the same emoji exists. If it's 2 or more, count 1 for each possible line in that sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should count each maximal line as a single occurrence. Like for a row with four same emojis, it's a single line of length 4, which counts as one. But in the problem statement, it's the count of lines of length >=2, not the sum of all possible consecutive pairs.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should consider both horizontal and vertical directions, and for each possible line of 2 or more same emojis, count it. So for a horizontal line of 3 same emojis, it includes two overlapping lines (positions 0-1, 1-2). But wait, that can't be right, because each is a separate line. Or perhaps it's better to count each maximal line as one, so a sequence of 3 same emojis would count as one line of length 3, not as two separate lines of length 2.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem counts each unique starting point, but in that case, a line of length 3 would have two possible starting points (each starting at first and second cell, each of which gives a line of length 2 and 2, but also the entire 3 is a line). Hmm, this could get complicated. Maybe the intended approach is to count all possible consecutive same emoji pairs in each line beyond length 2.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem: \"Number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So, for each maximal sequence of same emojis in a straight line, if it's 2 or longer, count it once.\n\nSo in the row 0, columns 0: 🌙, then 🧽, then 🌷, 🌷.\n\nThe last two are same, so that's one line of length 2. So that's counted once.\n\nIf there's a row like 🌝🌝🌝, that would be a line of length 3—so counted once, not multiple times for the combinations within it.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem counts how many times such lines appear. So for each possible row, how many lines of 2 or more emojis. For example, in a row of length 4 where all are same, we have for horizontal lines in that row: 1 (the entire width). Similarly, for a vertical column of 4: count as 1 line.\n\nYes, perhaps when the problem statement says \"lines\", it refers to continuous segments. So each occurrences of a continuous line of the same emoji in a row or column, of length 2 or more, is counted once per line.\n\nSo that's the approach. So, I'll need to scan each row and column for such lines.\n\nLet's go step by step.\n\nFirst, scan each row for horizontal lines.\n\nRow 0:\n🌙 🧽 🌷 🌷\n\nLooking for consecutive same emojis. \n\nStart from the first cell (🌙)—compare next cell 🧽, different, so nothing. Next cell 🧽, compare next → 🌷, no. Then 🌷 and next → same, so from index 2 to 3, that's a line of length 2. So count 1.\n\nRow 1:\n🌱 🧽 🌙 🌷\n\nCheck for consecutive same.\n\n1-0: 🌱 and 🧽 — no.\n1-1: 🧽 vs 🌙 — no.\n1-2: 🌙 vs 🌷 — no.\nOnly one cell after each, no more same, so no lines here.\n\nRow 2:\n🌱 🌙 🧽 🌱\n\nCheck each.\n\nStart at index 0: 🌱 next to 🌙? No.\nIndex 1: 🌙 vs 🧽? No.\nIndex 2: 🧽 vs 🌱? No.\nNo horizontal lines.\n\nRow 3:\n🌙 🌷 🧽 🌱\n\nCheck each.\n\n0-1: 🌙 vs 🌷 → no.\n1-2: 🌷 vs 🧽 → no.\n2-3: 🧽 vs 🌱 → no.\nSo no horizontal lines here.\n\nSo total horizontal lines so far: 1.\n\nNow, check the vertical lines. So for each column, check from top to bottom.\n\nColumn 0:\nRow 0: 🌙\nRow 1: 🌱\nRow 2: 🌱\nRow 3: 🌙\nLooking for consecutive same emojis. Let's look at each pair:\n\nRow 0 and 1: 🌙 vs 🌱 — different.\nRow 1 and 2: 🌱 vs 🌱 — same; so that's line length 2.\nRow 2 and 3: 🌱 vs 🌙 — different.\nSo in column 0, there's a line of length 2 starting at row 1 (so from row 1 to row 2). So count 1.\n\nColumn 1:\nRow 0: 🧽\nRow 1: 🧽\nRow 2: 🌙\nRow 3: 🌷\nCheck the pairs.\n\nRow 0 and 1: 🧽 vs 🧽 — same. So line of length 2.\nRow 1 and 2: 🧽 vs 🌙 — different.\nRow 2 and 3: 🌙 vs 🌷 — different.\nSo count 1 in column 1.\n\nColumn 2:\nRow 0: 🌷\nRow 1: 🌙\nRow 2: 🧽\nRow 3: 🧽\nPairs:\n\nRow0: 🌷, row1: 🌙 → different.\nRow1: 🌙, row2: 🧽 → different.\nRow2: 🧽, row3: 🧽 → same. So line of length 2.\nCount 1.\n\nColumn 3:\nRow0: 🌷\nRow1: 🌷\nRow2: 🌱\nRow3: 🌱\nCheck pairs:\n\nRow0-1: 🌷 vs 🌷 → same. Line length 2.\nRow1-2: 🌷 vs 🌱 → different.\nRow2-3: 🌱 vs 🌱 → same. Line length 2.\n\nSo in column 3, two vertical lines: row0-1 → one line, row2-3 → another line. So count 2.\n\nSumming the vertical lines: columns have lines in column0 (1), column1 (1), column2 (1), column3 (2) → total of 5.\n\nWait wait, no. Let me recheck.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRows 0 and 1 → same (🌷), so count 1.\n\nRows 1 and 2 are different.\n\nRows 2 and 3: both 🌱, so another line.\n\nSo that's two lines in column3.\n\nSo vertical lines in each column:\nColumn0: 1\nColumn1:1\nColumn2:1\nColumn3:2 → total of 5.\n\nNow, combined with horizontal lines which were 1.\n\nSo total lines: 1 (horizontal) +5 (vertical) =6.\n\nWait, let me check each column again.\n\nWait column0:\n\nLooking at each pair, but for vertical lines beyond a pair? For example, if there were three same in a column.\n\nBut in this case:\n\nAnother way: for each column, scan each consecutive pair.\n\nColumn0:\n\nEntries: 🌙, 🌱, 🌱, 🌙\n\nCompare each pair: rows 0-1: 🌙 vs 🌱 → different.\n\nRows 1-2: 🌱 vs 🌱 → same → line of length 2, count 1.\n\nRows 2-3: 🌱 vs 🌙 → different. So column0 contributes 1 line.\n\nColumn1:\n\nEntries: 🧽, 🧽, 🌙, 🌷.\n\nRows 0-1: same → count 1.\n\nRows 1-2: 🧽 vs 🌙 → different.\n\nRows 2-3: 🌙 vs 🌷 → different. So column1 contributes 1.\n\nColumn2:\n\nEntries: 🌷, 🌙, 🧽, 🧽.\n\nRows0-1: different.\n\nRows1-2: different.\n\nRows2-3: same → count 1.\n\nSo column2: 1.\n\nColumn3:\n\nEntries: 🌷, 🌷, 🌱, 🌱.\n\nRow0-1: same → count 1.\n\nRow1-2: different.\n\nRow2-3: same → count 2.\n\nSo column3 contributes 2 lines.\n\nTotal vertical lines: 1+1+1+2=5.\n\nHorizontal lines: row0 has 1 → others have none. So total 1.\n\nSo overall, 6 lines.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach to be safe. Perhaps I should consider each cell as a potential start of a line.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach undercounts some lines if a longer line exists.\n\nWait, no. Because for a line to be formed, it's a consecutive same emoji sequence. So in horizontal, for example, a run-length encoding of the row.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as finding all possible groups of 2 or 3 or 4 same in a row (horizontal or vertical).\n\nSo the way I did it counts each possible maximal line.\n\nWait, another test case.\n\nImagine a row of four same emojis: AAAA. Then there are multiple lines: the line covering positions 0-1 (2), 0-2 (3), 0-3 (4), positions 1-2 (2), 1-3 (3), 2-3 (2)—so 6 lines. But that would be an approach where each consecutive pair contributes, no matter the length. But that's different from the initial approach where I count each maximal line only once.\n\nBut according to the problem, that's not what's intended. Because the problem says \"number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the intended meaning is to find how many such line segments are present in the entire grid, regardless of their length beyond 2. So for each cell, as long as there's a continuation to the right (for horizontal) or below (for vertical) of at least one same emoji, then it's a line.\n\nWait, but then in the AAAA row, let's think:\n\nFor horizontal lines:\n\nFrom (0,0): the line to the right has 3 more cells, same. So the line formed is of length 4. So we count it once.\n\nWait, but is it counted as 3 possible lines (lengths 2,3,4)? Or just one.\n\nWait no, I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the exact problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\"\n\nSo perhaps it's every possible consecutive run of at least 2 cells in a line. For a run of 3, it has 2 lines of length 2 (starting at positions 0-1 and 1-2), but perhaps the problem counts this as one line (the maximum possible length).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to count each cell as the start of such a line, if the next cell is same. For example, in a run of two same cells, it's counted once. For a run of three, it's counted as one line of length 3, or as two lines (length 2 starting at cell 0, and another length 2 starting at cell 1).\n\nWait, but that would complicate the count. Let's think about another example.\n\nExample:\n\nRow is A A A.\n\nSo for horizontal lines:\n\n- Starting at 0, length 2 → yes (positions 0-1)\n- Starting at 0, length3 → also yes\n- Starting at 1, length2. \nSo is that three lines (overlaps) or one line of length 3.\n\nWell, the problem is ambiguous, but perhaps the intended answer is to count each maximal line once, regardless of how many subsets it includes. For example, a run of A A A leads to a line of length 3, which is >2, and counts as one line.\n\nSimilarly, in a W horizontal row with 4 A's, how many lines? Let me clarify with the board given. Suppose a 2x2 grid:\n\nA A\nA A\n\nEach row has two A's → each row contributes a horizontal line. So row 0 and row 1 each have a line, so 2.\n\nSimilarly, each column would also have a line. There are 2 columns, each of 2 A's → 2 vertical lines, so total horizontal (2) + vertical (2)=4.\n\nBut according to the initial approach, each horizontal line and vertical line is only counted once.\n\nBut wait, looking at another example, the initial problem:\n\nIn this problem, I have 1 horizontal line and 5 vertical lines, totaling 6. But according to the problem's grid, let me re-express it more clearly.\n\nAnother way to approach is to scan each possible pair in rows and columns and count all such max lines:\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

So run row0-row1 → count 1.\n\nColumn2: 🌷, 🌙, 🧽, 🧽 → rows2-3 have run → count 1.\n\nColumn3: 🌷🌷 (rows0-1), 🌱🌱 (rows2-3) → two runs → count 2.\n\nSo vertical lines: 1+1+1+2 =5.\n\nTotal 1+5=6 lines.\n\nSo I think the answer is 6.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more on a given 4x4 board.

{"board":[["🌚","🌚","🐚","🌚"],["🍃","🐚","🌺","🌚"],["🍃","🍃","🐚","🐚"],["🌚","🍃","🍃","🍃"]],"response":["<think>\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have a rectangular board made of emojis, and I have to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more. Hmm, let's think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should probably represent the board as a grid, so I can easily check each row and column for consecutive emojis. Since the board is given as a string with each row separated by a new line, I can split each row into a list of characters. That will make it easier to access each cell in the grid.\n\nSo the board is provided as:\n\n🌚🌚🐚🌚\n🍃🐚🌺🌚\n🍃🍃🐚🐚\n🌚🍃🍃🍃\n\nI can picture this as a 4x4 grid because there are four rows, each with four emojis.\n\nNow, I need to check each row for horizontal lines. For each row, I will look for sequences where two or more emojis are the same. But here's a thing: if there are more than two in a row, like three of the same, it counts as one line of length three, not two separate lines (of two and two overlapping). Wait, no, actually, the problem says lines of length 2 or more. So a line of length 3 would count as one line. But what about a line that's part of a longer sequence? Maybe I should just check each possible consecutive pair and see how long each sequence is but group them so that overlapping isn't double-counted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to iterate each row and identify all the start and end of sequences of the same emoji. For a row, the steps could be:\n\n1. Initialize previous emoji as the first in the row.\n2. Move to the next emoji.\n   a. If it's the same as previous, increment current run length.\n   b. If different, check if the run was >=2, add as a line. Reset run length to 1, update previous.\n   c. If at end of row, check if run >=2 and add as line if so.\nBut wait, this approach counts any group of two or more in a row as a single line. So for a row like AAA, it adds 1 line of length 3, but perhaps I should count each possible consecutive pair as a separate line?\n\nWait, no. Let's think: the problem says, \"horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So, each contiguous group counts as one line based on how many consecutive emojis are same.\n\nWait, maybe that's not it. For example, in a horizontal line of 3, like AAA, that's a single line of length 3. So in this case, the number of lines is 1 for that row. But another example: if a row is AABBB, then the horizontal lines are the AA (count 1) and the BBB (count 1), so total 2.\n\nBut another possibility: maybe the line's length counts as number of total cells in the line, but the question is to count each unique line once, regardless of its length, as long as it's >=2.\n\nYes, that's the correct interpretation. Because the problem statement says lines with a length of 2 or more. So each such line, regardless of how long it is, counts as one line.\n\nSo in a row like AABBB, there's two lines: AA and BBB.\n\nWait, no. Because in that row, the two A's make a line of length 2, and the three B's make a line of length 3. So each is counted as one line, so altogether it's two lines in that row for that example. Additionally, vertical lines are checked in the same way.\n\nSo, back to the solution. So for each row, examine each position, check if the current emoji is same as next, and count how many lines (sequences) of length >=2.\n\nSame for each column: for each column, check vertical sequences.\n\nSo the approach could be:\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n   For each position in the row (from 0 to length-2):\n       Check if current and next are the same. Then, check how long the consecutive sequence starting at current is. For that, start a loop from current onwards to find how many are same. Once the end of the sequence is found, increment the count for lines of length 2 or more.\n\nWait, but if in a row, like AAA, then positions 0 and 1 are same, 1 and 2 same. But this would form a single line of length 3, so it should be counted once. However, in this method, just checking each consecutive pair would count: (A, A) at positions 0-1, (A, A) at 1-2. But that would count two lines, but actually it's just one line.\n\nWait, no, in that case, for the row AAA:\n\nWe can see that starting at index 0, the sequence is 3 long. So the count would be 1 line, not two. So in this approach, I shouldn't count each consecutive pair but look for the maximal sequences.\n\nSo a better approach is for each row, to find all maximal same-emoji sequences and count how many are >=2.\n\nSame for each column.\n\nSo for maximal sequences, in any row, each group of 2 or more is a line.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop through each row and for each, split into groups of same emojis, count each group whose length is >=2.\n\nDo the same for each column, split into groups and count.\n\nSo the total lines is sum of both.\n\nSo how to implement this.\n\nLet's first model the board.\n\nThe board is 4 rows, each 4 characters.\n\nRow 0: 🌚🌚🐚🌚\nSo split into groups: [🌚, 🌚], [🐚], [🌚]. So the groups of length 2: first group is size 2, counts as 1 line.\n\nRow 1: 🍃🐚🌺🌚\nGroups are each size 1, so no horizontal lines.\n\nRow 2: 🍃🍃🐚🐚\nGroups: [🍃, 🍃], [🐚, 🐚]. Both are size 2. So 2 lines.\n\nRow 3: 🌚🍃🍃🍃\nGroups: [🌚], [🍃, 🍃, 🍃]. So one group of 3, counts as 1 line.\n\nSo the horizontal lines: 1 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 4 lines.\n\nNow, vertical lines. For each column, split into same-emoji groups and count those >=2.\n\nLet's look at each column.\n\nColumn 0: 🌚, 🍃, 🍃, 🌚\n\nSo the list is 🌚, 🍃, 🍃, 🌚.\n\nLooking for consecutive same emojis.\n\nColumns are four in total, let's check each.\n\nColumn 0:\n- [🌚] → 1\n- [🍃, 🍃] → 1 group, so count +=1\n+ Next: 🍃, 🌚 no, so total groups of size >=2 in this column: 1.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the column is:\n\nElement 0: row 0 is 🌚,\nrow1: 🍃,\nrow2: 🍃,\nrow3: 🌚\n\nSo the sequence is 🌚, 🍃, 🍃, 🌚.\n\nSo consecutive emojis:\n\nBetween row0 and row1: different.\n\nBetween row1 and row2: same. So that's a group of 2, in positions row1 and row2.\n\nBetween row2 and row3: different.\n\nSo for column 0, there's one group (rows 1 and 2) length 2 → count as 1 line.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nEach row in column 1:\n\nRow0: 🐚\nRow1: 🐚\nRow2: 🐚\nRow3: 🍃\n\nWait no, let me recheck the board.\n\nWait the columns are arranged as each row being four elements. So to get each column, we have to pick the ith element from each row.\n\nOriginal board by row:\n\nRow 0: 🌚, 🌚, 🐚, 🌚 → col0: 🌚, col1:🌚, col2:🐚, col3:🌚\n\nRow1: 🍃, 🐚, 🌺, 🌚 → col0: 🍃, col1: 🐚, col2: 🌺, col3:🌚\n\nRow2: 🍃, 🍃, 🐚, 🐚 → col0: 🍃, col1: 🍃, col2: 🐚, col3:🐚.\n\nRow3: 🌚, 🍃, 🍃, 🍃 → col0: 🌚, col1: 🍃, col2: 🍃, col3: 🍃.\n\nSo for column 1:\n\nRow0: 🌚\n\nRow1: 🐚\n\nRow2: 🍃\n\nRow3: 🍃\n\nSo each element is: 🌚 (row0), 🐚 (row1), 🍃 (row2), 🍃 (row3).\n\nLooking for consecutive same emojis.\n\nBetween row0 and row1: different (🌚 vs 🐚)\nBetween row1 and row2: different (🐚 vs 🍃)\nBetween row2 and row3: same (🍃 and 🍃). So a group of 2. → count 1.\n\nColumn 1 vertical lines: 1 line.\n\nWait, no. The group is rows 2-3. So that's a line of length 2. So count as 1.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow0: 🐚.\n\nRow1: 🌺.\n\nRow2: 🐚.\n\nRow3: 🍃.\n\nEach element in the column:\n\nRow0: 🐚.\n\nRow1: 🌺.\n\nRow2: 🐚.\n\nRow3: 🍃.\n\nNo consecutive duplicates. So for column 2, no lines.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow0: 🌚.\n\nRow1: 🌚.\n\nRow2: 🐚.\n\nRow3: 🍃.\n\nSo column 3 is 🌚, 🌚, 🐚, 🍃.\n\nCheck:\n\nRow0 and row1: same 🌚 → form a group of 2. So count 1.\n\nRow1 and row2: different.\n\nRow2 and row3: different.\n\nSo column 3 has one line.\n\nSo all columns:\n\nColumn 0: 1 line.\n\nColumn 1: 1 line.\n\nColumn 2: 0.\n\nColumn 3: 1 line.\n\nSo vertical lines: 1+1+0+1=3.\n\nTotal horizontal lines were 4.\n\nSo total lines: 4 +3 =7.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my analysis.\n\nWait now I think I may have made a mistake. Because I thought the vertical for column 1 has one line, column0 has one, column 3 has one, which sums to three.\n\nWait, but looking back, for vertical:\n\nLooking at column 0: the two middle rows (1 and 2) in this column are 🍃 and 🍃, forming a line. So that's one line.\n\nColumn1: rows 2 and 3 are 🍃, so that's one line.\n\nColumn3: rows 0 and 1 are 🌚, so one line.\n\nThat's 3 lines.\n\nNow, did I miss any?\n\nYes. Wait, column 2 is 🐚, 🌺, 🐚, 🍃. No lines. So 3 vertical lines. So total vertical lines: 3.\n\nSo overall:\n\nhorizontal lines:4. vertical lines:3 → total 7.\n\nNow, are there any other possibilities? Hmm, perhaps I should go through each row and column again, just to make sure.\n\nLet me do it step by step.\n\nCheck each row for horizontal lines.\n\nRow 0:\n\n🌚, 🌚, 🐚, 🌚.\n\nSo from 🌚, 🌚 is a group of 2 → count as 1.\n\nThen 🐚 is single. Then 🌚: single. So row0 contributes 1.\n\nRow1:\n\n🍃, 🐚, 🌺, 🌚 → each is single. No lines.\n\nRow2:\n\n🍃, 🍃, 🐚, 🐚 → two groups, each of size 2. So 2 lines.\n\nRow3:\n\n🌚, 🍃, 🍃, 🍃 → group of 3. So 1 line.\n\nSo total horizontal lines:1 (row0) +0 (row1) +2 (row2) +1 (row3) =4.\n\nNow vertical lines: each column.\n\nColumn 0:\n\n🌚, 🍃, 🍃, 🌚 → group at rows 1-2 (🍃, 🍃) → 1 line.\n\nColumn1:\n\n🌚, 🐚, 🍃, 🍃 → group at rows 2-3 (🍃, 🍃): 1 line.\n\nColumn2:\n\n🐚, 🌺, 🐚, 🍃 → no same in a row.\n\nWait, row0 has 🐚, row2 has 🐚. So between row0 and row2: 🐚 and 🐚 are in column2. But consecutive?\n\nNo. Because column2 of rows 0 and1 are 🐚 (row0), 🌺 (row1) → different. row1 is 🌺, row2 is 🐚 → different. row2 is 🐚, row3 is 🍃 → different. So column2 has no lines.\n\nWait but wait: in column2, row0 is 🐚, row2 is 🐚, but are they consecutive? No, because row1 (middle) is 🌺. So no.\n\nColumn3:\n\n🌚, 🌚, 🐚, 🍃 → rows0 and1 are 🌚: a group of 2 → 1 line.\n\nSo vertical lines: column0 (1) + column1 (1) + column3 (1) = 3.\n\nTotal lines:4 +3 =7.\n\nSo the answer should be 7.\n\nI think that's the correct count.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more, on a 4x4 grid of emojis.

Hmm, let me try to figure this out.\n\nAlright, the board is a 4x4 grid, right? Each row has four emojis. The task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, and each line has to be of length 2 or more. So I need to look both horizontally across each row and vertically down each column.\n\nLet me write down the board first to visualize it better.\n\nRow 0: 🐊 🐕 🌹 🌕\nRow 1: 🐕 🌕 🐕 🐊\nRow 2: 🌹 🐊 🐕 🌕\nRow 3: 🐊 🌕 🐊 🌹\n\nNow, I'll start by checking each row for horizontal lines.\n\nRow 0: 🐊, 🐕, 🌹, 🌕. All are different, so no lines here.\n\nRow 1: 🐕, 🌕, 🐕, 🐊. Looking for 2 or more same in a row. Let's see:\n- Position 0 is 🐕, next is 🌕 (different), so no line there.\n- Position 1 is 🌕, next is 🐕 (diff), no.\n- Position 2 is 🐕, position 3 is 🐊 (diff). So, seems like no horizontal lines in row1.\n\nWait, no, let me check again. The first row, actually, starts with 🐕, then 🌕, then 🐕. So 0 and 2 are 🐕, but they're not adjacent. Oh, but wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's break it down:\n\nLooking for consecutive same emojis. So, in row1:\n\nPositions 0: 🐕 and 1: 🌕 → different.\n\nPositions 1: 🌕 and 2: 🐕 → different.\n\nPositions 2: 🐕 and 3: 🐊 → different. So no horizontal lines here.\n\nRow2: 🌹 🐊 🐕 🌕. All differ, so no lines.\n\nRow3: 🐊 🌕 🐊 🌹. Let's check:\nPosition0 🐊, position1 🌕 → different.\nPosition1 🌕, position2 🐊 → different.\nPosition2 🐊, position3 🌹 → different. So no horizontal lines here.\n\nSo, there are no horizontal lines of length 2 or more. Wait, but I might have missed something. Did any row have a pair or triplet?\n\nWait another look: row1. Oh wait, no, all are single. So horizontal count is zero. Hmm.\n\nNow, onto the columns. Each column has 4 emojis. I'll go through each column from top to bottom.\n\nColumn 0:\n🐊 (Row0), 🐕 (Row1), 🌹 (Row2), 🐊 (Row3).\nLooking for consecutive emojis. Let's break it down:\n- R0 and R1: 🐊 vs 🐕 → no.\n- R1 and R2: 🐕 vs 🌹 → no.\n- R2 and R3: 🌹 vs 🐊 → no. So, no lines in column0.\n\nColumn1:\n🐕 (R0), 🌕 (R1), 🐊 (R2), 🌕 (R3)\nLooking for consecutive:\n- 🐕 and 🌕 → no.\n- 🌕 and 🐊 → no.\n- 🐊 and 🌕 → no. No lines here.\n\nColumn2:\n🌹 (R0), 🐕 (R1), 🐕 (R2), 🐊 (R3).\nCheck for consecutive same:\nR0 🌹 and R1 🐕 → no.\nR1 🐕 and R2 🐕 → yes, that's two in a row. So that's one line (length 2).\nWhat about longer? Let's see:\nR1: 🐕, R2: 🐕, R3: 🐊 → stop here. So only two in a row. So that's one line.\n\nR2 and R3 are different. So column2 contributes one line.\n\nWait, but I thought R2 and R3 are different. Yes.\n\nColumn3:\n🌕 (R0), 🐊 (R1), 🌕 (R2), 🌹 (R3).\nLooking:\nR0 and R1: 🌕 vs 🐊 → no.\nR1 and R2: 🐊 vs 🌕 → no.\nR2 and R3: 🌕 vs 🌹 → no. So column3 has none.\n\nSo vertical lines: column2 contributes 1.\n\nWait, but did I miss any vertical lines? Let me double-check each column.\n\nWait column2 again:\n\nR0: 🌹, R1: 🐕, R2: 🐕, R3: 🐊.\n\nSo between R1 and R2: two 🐕, so that's a line of length 2, hence count as one.\n\nAny longer? No. What about column1?\n\nR3 is 🌕. Let's check R3 and R2 in column1: R3 is 🌕, R2 is 🐊 → different.\n\nSo vertical lines only have one.\n\nWait another idea: are there any lines longer than 2? Because sometimes a line of 3 or 4 would contribute multiple lines of length >=2.\n\nWait, for example, a row like 🐕🐕🐕 would contribute two lines: positions 0-1, 1-2, but also 0-1-2 as a line of length 3. Wait, but the question counts each line as any sequence of 2 or more, regardless of longer ones. Or does it count each possible consecutive same emojis.\n\nWait, perhaps each line is a maximal run—so a run of three is one line of length 3, not broken into smaller lines. Because, for example, in a run of 3 same emojis, it's a single line of length 3, and should be counted as one.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it says \"lines formed by same emoji with length 2 or more.\" So in a row of 3 same, it's a single line, not two separate lines of 2.\n\nSo in my approach, for each row and column, I need to check for runs of 2 or more and count each maximal run as one.\n\nSo in column2, the two 🐕s in row1 and row2 are one line of length 2. So that's one vertical line.\n\nNow, wait—any other vertical lines I might have missed. Let me go through each column again.\n\nColumn0: 🐊, 🐕, 🌹, 🐊. No two same in a row.\n\nColumn1: 🐕, 🌕, 🐊, 🌕. R0: 🐕, R1: 🌕 is different. R1: 🌕 and R2: 🐊 → different. R2: 🐊 and R3: 🌕 → different. No lines here.\n\nColumn3: 🌕, 🐊, 🌕, 🌹. R0 and R1: different. R1 and R2: 🐊 and 🌕 → different. R2 and R3: 🌕 and 🌹 → different. No lines.\n\nSo vertical lines: only column2's 🐕🐕.\n\nWhat about horizontal lines—I must have missed something earlier. Let's re-examine each row.\n\nRow0: All different. So no.\n\nRow1: 🐕 🌕 🐕 🐊. Now, the first element is 🐕, the third is 🐕. So in row1, the 🐕s are at positions0,2. Are these consecutive? No, because position1 is 🌕 in between. So they are not in a run. So the row has a single 🐕 at position0, then a 🌕, then a 🐕, but not consecutive. So no horizontal lines in row1.\n\nRow2: All different? Let me check. Row2: 🌹 🐊 🐕 🌕. All four are different, I think. So no lines here.\n\nRow3: 🐊 🌕 🐊 🌹. Looking for consecutive duplicates.\n\n- Position0 🐊, position1 🌕: no.\n- Position1 🌕, position2 🐊: no.\n- Position2 🐊, position3 🌹: no. So no lines.\n\nWait, but what about other possibilities? Hmm. Maybe the problem counts both horizontal and vertical?\n\nWait, perhaps I should also consider other lines, like diagonal or something. No, the question specifically says horizontal or vertical lines. So yeah, no need to check diagonals.\n\nSo up to now, I have 1 vertical line. Is that all?\n\nWait, I think I'm missing something. Let me re-examine each row carefully.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me take each row and mode each possible line:\n\nRow0:\n🐊 🐕 🌹 🌕: no consecutive same, so no.\n\nRow1:\nPositions 0:🐕, positions1:🌕 → no. Positions1:🌕, positions2:🐕 → no. Positions2:🐕, positions3:🐊→ no. So no lines.\n\nRow2:\nNo.\n\nRow3:\n\nNo.\n\nWait, so that's zero horizontal lines.\n\nVertical:\n\nOnly column2 has one line.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's look at column1 again. Is there any place where two same emojis are in a row?\n\nColumn1:\nRow0: 🐕\nRow1: 🌕\nRow2: 🐊\nRow3: 🌕\nSo from row3, it's 🌕. No consecutive same in the column. So no lines.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for longer runs in verticals. But in this case, column2 is the only one.\n\nWait, maybe I should check another approach. For each line (horizontal or vertical), check each possible starting point for a run.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only horizontal lines are rows, columns are vertical.\n\nWait, the board is 4 rows, each with 4 emojis.\n\nSo for Horizontal lines:\n\nEach row is checked for runs of same emoji >=2.\n\nFor Vertical lines:\n\nEach column is checked for runs of same emoji >=2.\n\nEach row and column can contribute multiple runs, as separate sequences.\n\nWait, so if a row has a run of 3, that contributes one line (length 3). For example, \"AAAB\" would have a run of 3 A's, so one line.\n\nIf a row is \"AABBA\", check:\n\nFrom 0 to 1: AA (count as 1), then BB (count another 1). So two lines in the same row.\n\nWait, but in this case, if a row is ABBA, then the middle two B's are a run of 2, so count as one line.\n\nSo perhaps I should for each row scan for runs and count each run of two or more as one.\n\nSo let me retry checking columns:\n\nColumn 0: 🐊 (R0), 🐕 (R1), 🌹 (R2), 🐊 (R3).\n\nLooking for runs. Each position and see if the next is same.\n\nR0 and R1: different.\n\nR1 and R2: different.\n\nR2 and R3: different.\n\nNo runs.\n\nColumn1: 🐕 (R0), 🌕 (R1), 🐊 (R2), 🌕 (R3).\n\nR0 to R1: different.\n\nR1 to R2: 🌕 vs 🐊 → no.\n\nR2 to R3: 🐊 vs 🌕 → no.\n\nNo runs.\n\nColumn2: 🌹 (R0), 🐕 (R1), 🐕 (R2), 🐊 (R3).\n\nCheck between:\n\nR0 and R1: 🌹 vs 🐕 → no.\n\nR1 and R2: 🐕 and 🐕 → yes. So that's a run of 2. So one run.\n\nR2 and R3: 🐕 vs 🐊 → no.\n\nSo column2 has 1 run.\n\nColumn3: 🌕 (R0), 🐊 (R1), 🌕 (R2), 🌹 (R3).\n\nR0-R1: 🌕 vs 🐊 → no.\n\nR1-R2: 🐊 vs 🌕 → no.\n\nR2-R3: 🌕 vs 🌹 → no.\n\nSo vertical runs: 1.\n\nNow, for the horizontal rows, I think I have to recheck.\n\nRow0: all different.\n\nRow1:\n\nPositions 0,1,2,3:\n\n0: 🐕, 1:🌕, 2:🐕, 3:🐊.\n\nCheck for runs.\n\nStart at 0: 🐕, next is 🌕 → different → run length 1. No.\n\nBut wait, something's not right here. Because the positions 0 and 2 in row1 are both 🐕, but they are not consecutive, so they don't form a run. So no runs in row1.\n\nRow2:\n\nAll different.\n\nRow3.\n\nPositions 0: 🐊, 1: 🌕, 2: 🐊, 3:🌹.\n\nCheck runs:\n\n0 and 1: 🐊 vs 🌕 → no.\n\n1 and 2: 🌕 vs 🐊 → no.\n\n2 and3: 🐊 vs 🌹 → no.\n\nWait, but position 2 is 🐊, same as position0. Are they in a run? No, because between them is a 🌕. So no.\n\nWait a minute, but what about row 3:\n\n🐊 🌕 🐊 🌹\n\nPositions 0 and 2 are same, but separated by a different emoji. So no run there.\n\nSo, how about this—so each row and column is scanned for consecutive emojis.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I should iterate through each cell as the start of a run, check how far it can go, and count it if the run is >=2.\n\nFor example, for a run in the same row, start at each position, and check horizontally to the right, and see maximum length. If length >=2, count as one.\n\nSame for columns, check down.\n\nSo, for each cell (i,j), check right and down for maximum same emojis.\n\nBut considering that each line (run) is counted once, even if it overlaps with others.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of each maximal run.\n\nLet me try this.\n\nFor horizontal lines:\n\nCheck each row, each position from 0 to 3, see if current and next are same. If so, extend as far as possible, then count as one line if the length >=2.\n\nFor example:\n\nIn row1, starting at position0: 🐕, next is 🌕 → different. So no.\n\nStart at position1: 🌕, next is 🐕 → different.\n\nStart at position2: 🐕, next is 🐊 → different.\n\nSo no horizontal lines in row1.\n\nWait but another scenario: suppose in a row like 🐕🌕🐊🐕.\n\nIn that case, starting at 0: two 🐕s? No, it's 🐕🌕 so different. So no run. Or wait, 🐕 and 🌕 are different.\n\nWait no, in my problem, the emojis are different: row1 is 🐕🌕🐕🐊.\n\nSo in that row, the third element is 🐕, but it's followed by 🐊. So again, no.\n\nSo perhaps, horizontally, it's picking up nothing.\n\nWait but maybe I need to re-express row1 as:\n\n🐕, 🌕, 🐕, 🐊.\n\nAre there any two consecutive same? The second and third elements: 🌕 and 🐕 → No. So no.\n\nTherefore, for all four rows, no horizontal runs.\n\nBut wait—am I missing row1? Because the first and third emojis are 🐕—but they are not consecutive, so that's not a run.\n\nSo, only column2's 🐕🐕 as found earlier, so vertical run of 2, count as one.\n\nBut I'm getting only 1 line total. But wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, what about column1. Let me re-examine.\n\nColumn1: R0 is 🐕, R1 is 🌕, R2 is 🐊, R3 is 🌕.\n\nSo between R0 and R1: 🐕 vs 🌕: no.\n\nR1 and R2: 🌕 vs 🐊: no.\n\nR2 and R3: 🐊 vs 🌕: no. So no runs.\n\nAny other places?\n\nWait, perhaps looking for runs of three or four. But in the given board, I don't think any columns or rows have that.\n\nWait, but what about the third column:\n\nColumn3:\n\nR0: 🌕\n\nR1: 🐊\n\nR2: 🌕\n\nR3: 🌹\n\nSo R0 and R1: no.\n\nR1 and R2: 🐊 vs 🌕: no.\n\nR2 and R3: yes? 🌕 vs 🌹: no, they are different.\n\nNo runs.\n\nWait—I'm back to vertical count of 1 only.\n\nHmm, but according to the initial assessment, the count is 1. But maybe I'm forgetting something else.\n\nWait, thinking again: is there any other possible vertical or horizontal line with two or more same emojis.\n\nWait, let's look at the third row again: 🌹 🐊 🐕 🌕.\n\nRow2:\n\nR2: 🌹 🐊 🐕 🌕.\n\nYes, all are different, so no.\n\nWait, perhaps looking at other columns.\n\nWait column2 has the only vertical run.\n\nSo overall, the total lines are 1.\n\nBut I was just thinking—what about (column3, row3)? It's 🌹, which might be similar to row0, column2 which is 🌹 in row0. No, because not consecutive.\n\nWait, no, wait.\n\nLooking back at column2, row0 is 🌹, row1 and 2 are 🐕s, but for the run to be in column2, the same emoji should be consecutive down the column.\n\nWait, no, what's the emoji in column2:\n\nRow0: 🌹\n\nRow1: 🐕 (column2, row1?)\n\nWait no, columns are from 0 to 3.\n\nWait confusion: better map indexes.\n\nLet me reindex the board. Rows 0-3, each have 4 elements, columns 0-3.\n\nSo row0:\n\n0: 🐊\n\n1: 🐕\n\n2: 🌹\n\n3: 🌕\n\nRow1:\n\n0: 🐕\n\n1: 🌕\n\n2: 🐕\n\n3: 🐊\n\nRow2:\n\n0: 🌹\n\n1: 🐊\n\n2: 🐕\n\n3: 🌕\n\nRow3:\n\n0: 🐊\n\n1: 🌕\n\n2: 🐊\n\n3: 🌹\n\nSo, column0:\n\nRow0: 🐊\n\nRow1: 🐕\n\nRow2: 🌹\n\nRow3: 🐊\n\nColumn0: 🐊, 🐕, 🌹, 🐊. No two same in a row.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow0: 🐕\n\nRow1: 🌕\n\nRow2: 🐊\n\nRow3: 🌕\n\nNo runs.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: 🌹\n\nRow1: 🐕\n\nRow2: 🐕\n\nRow3: 🐊\n\nSo, column2:\n\nRow0: 🌹\n\nRow1: 🐕\n\nRow2: 🐕 -- these are consecutive, same as row1.\n\nSo between row1 and row2, the column2 has two 🐕s, so that's a run length of 2. Thus, one vertical line.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🌕\n\nRow1: 🐊\n\nRow2: 🌕\n\nRow3: 🌹\n\nSo, looking for consecutive same. Let's see:\n\nRow0: 🌕\n\nRow1: 🐊 → no.\n\nRow1: 🐊\n\nRow2: 🌕 → no.\n\nRow2: 🌕\n\nRow3: 🌹 → no.\n\nNo runs in column3.\n\nSo only vertical run counts as 1, and no horizontal runs. So the total is 1 line.\n\nWait, but the sample state I saw earlier had this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing some lines in the vertical columns.\n\nWait, let me think this way.\n\nLet me list all possible lines:\n\nVertical lines in columns:\n\nOnly column2 has a run from row1 to row2 (🐕, 🐕): that's 1 line.\n\nWhat about column0: any runs? Let's think at row3, is there anything same as row2 or row1 in column0?\n\nRow2: 🌹, row3: 🐊 → same: no.\n\nNo runs in column0.\n\nHorizontal lines:\n\nLooking at each row for consecutive same emojis.\n\nRow0:\n\nEach adjacent pair: 🐊🐕 (different), 🐕🌹 (diff), 🌹🌕 (diff). No runs.\n\nRow1:\n\nLooking for adjacent same.\n\n🐕 to 🌕: different.\n\n🌕 to 🐕: different.\n\n🐕 to 🐊: different.\n\nNo runs.\n\nRow2: All adjacent pairs different.\n\nRow3:\n\n🐊 and 🌕: different.\n\n🌕 and 🐊: different.\n\n🐊 and 🌹: different.\n\nWait, so what about row2: 🌹 🐊 🐕 🌕.\n\nNo same consecutive.\n\nHmm. So my conclusion is that the total number is 1.\n\nBut wait, why am I so sure. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe there's another vertical line in another column.\n\nBut looking again:\n\nColumn0: 🐊, 🐕, 🌹, 🐊. Any consecutive same? R3 is 🐊, same as R0. No, because R0: 🐊, R1: 🐕 → different. So no.\n\nColumn1:\n\nAfter R3, no changes.\n\nWait, perhaps horizontal lines somewhere else?\n\nLet me check the first column in row2 and row3 for same emojis.\n\nRow2, column1 is 🐊.\n\nRow3, column1 is 🌕. So different.\n\nWait, maybe my initial approach is flawed, and I should think about the possibility of horizontal and vertical lines separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering that row1 and row2 in column2 counts as one line, but maybe it's more.\n\nBut no, in column2, there are two 🐕s in a row (R1 and R2), which is one vertical line.\n\nWhat about row1: are there any horizontal runs I missed? Let's check again.\n\nR1: 🐕 🌕 🐕 🐊.\n\nLooking for consecutive same. Let's see each adjacent pair:\n\n1 and 0: 🐕 and 🌕 → different.\n\n1 and 2: 🌕 and 🐕 → different.\n\n1 and 3: 🐕 and 🐊 → different.\n\nSo no runs in row1.\n\nHmmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm correct, the answer is 1.\n\nBut I'm supposed to give an answer, right?\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should double-check the entire board for any possible runs.\n\nWait the first thought: total lines is 1. But perhaps I'm wrong and missed some others.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: list all possible lines of two or more.\n\nLet me go row by row and column by column.\n\nCheck each possible consecutive pair, triplet, etc.\n\nStarting with rows:\n\nRow0: no runs.\n\nRow1: each pair is different. So no runs.\n\nRow2: each pair different.\n\nRow3: each pair different.\n\nColumns:\n\nCol0: only pairs but different.\n\nCol1: each pair different.\n\nCol2: row1 and row2 same (🐕), count as 1.\n\nCol3: each pair different.\n\nSo only 1 line.\n\nSo the answer should be 1.\n\nWait, but another perspective—maybe a line can be of two same anywhere in the same row, but not necessarily consecutive. Oh wait, no. Lines are formed by consecutive same.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the only line is the vertical run in column2.\n\nTherefore, the total is 1.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more on a 4x4 emoji board. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Horizontal Check**: Examine each row for consecutive emojis. If two or more identical emojis appear consecutively, it is counted as one horizontal line.\n2. **Vertical Check**: Examine each column for consecutive emojis. If two or more identical emojis appear consecutively, it is counted as one vertical line.\n3. **Maximal Runs**: Each maximal run of identical emojis (a sequence of 2 or more consecutive identical emojis) is counted as one line, regardless of its length.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_lines(board):\n    rows = len(board)\n    cols = len(board[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    count = 0\n\n    # Check horizontal lines\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols - 1):\n            if board[i][j] == board[i][j + 1]:\n                count += 1\n                # Skip consecutive counts for the same run (e.g., in \"AAAB\", only count \"AAAA\" as one)\n                while j + 1 < cols and board[i][j] == board[i][j + 1]:\n                    j += 1\n\n    # Check vertical lines\n    for j in range(cols):\n        for i in range(rows - 1):\n            if board[i][j] == board[i + 1][j]:\n                count += 1\n                # Skip consecutive counts for the same run\n                while i + 1 < rows and board[i][j] == board[i + 1][j]:\n                    i += 1\n\n    return count\n\n# Define the board\nboard = [\n    [\"🐊\", \"🐕\", \"🌹\", \"🌕\"],\n    [\"🐕\", \"🌕\", \"🐕\", \"🐊\"],\n    [\"🌹\", \"🐊\", \"🐕\", \"🌕\"],\n    [\"🐊\", \"🌕\", \"🐊\", \"🌹\"]\n]\n\n# Calculate the result\nresult = count_lines(board)\nprint(f\"Answer: {result}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Horizontal Lines**: Each row is scanned for consecutive identical emojis. For example, in a row like `🐕🌕🐕`, there is one horizontal line of length 3.\n- **Vertical Lines**: Each column is scanned for consecutive identical emojis. For example, in a column like `🐕🐕`, there is one vertical line of length 2.\n- **Maximal Runs**: Each maximal run of identical emojis is counted as one line, regardless of its length. For example, in a sequence like `🐕🐕🐕`, it is counted as one line, not multiple overlapping lines.\n\nAfter scanning all rows and columns, the total number of horizontal and vertical lines formed by the same emoji is returned as the result.\n\nAnswer: 1"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

{"board":[["🦏","🦏","🦏","🦏"],["🐋","🦏","🦟","🐋"],["🦞","🦏","🐋","🦟"],["🦏","🐋","🦟","🦞"]],"response":["<think>\nOkay, so I've got this problem where I have to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines on a 4x4 board made of emojis. Each line has to be made of the same emoji and have a length of at least 2. Hmm, I need to go through the board row by row and column by column to check for these lines.\n\nFirst, let's look at each row. There are four rows in total.\n\nThe first row is 🦏🦏🦏🦏. All four are rhinos (🦏), right? So that's a horizontal line of length 4. So that's one line.\n\nNow, the second row: 🐋🦏🦟🐋. Let's break it down. The first character is whale (🐋), then rhino, then another, and then whale again. So there's no consecutive same emojis here, I think. Wait, let's check each position. The first two are 🐋 and 🦏—different. Then 🦏 and 🦟—different. Next, 🦟 and 🐋—also different. So no horizontal lines here longer than 1.\n\nThird row: 🦞🦏🐋🦟. Each is different—lobster, rhino, whale, shark. So no lines in this row either.\n\nFourth row: 🦏🐋🦟🦞. Again, all different—rhino, whale, shark, lobster. So no horizontal lines beyond length 1 here.\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, I think I misread. Let me check again. Each row is 4 emojis, so I should check for runs of 2 or more in a row. So the first row clearly has four rhinos. So that's 4 in a line, which counts as one line since it's a single continuous block.\n\nWait, no, the problem says to count each line, regardless of how long it is beyond 2. So one line in the first row.\n\nNow, the columns. Let's look each column from top to bottom.\n\nFirst column: 🦏, 🐋, 🦞, 🦏. So the sequence is rhino, whale, lobster, rhino. Let's see if any of these have consecutive same emojis. Well, the first two are different. Then, moving down: 🐋 (second row) to 🦞 (third)—different. Then 🦞 to 🦏 (fourth)—different. So no vertical lines in the first column.\n\nSecond column: 🦏, 🦏, 🦏, 🐋. So first row is rhino, second is rhino, third is rhino, fourth is whale. So let's look top to bottom. Rows 1-2: same—so that's a vertical line of two rhinos. Then rows 2 and 3: same, so another line of two. Wait, but if I have three in a row, how does that affect the count?\n\nWait, in the second column, the emojis are:\n\nRow1: 🦏\nRow2: 🦏\nRow3: 🦏\nRow4: 🐋\n\nSo from row1 to row2: same (2), row2-row3: same (2). Then row3 is followed by row4, different.\n\nSo in total, there's a vertical run of three rhinos. How does that translate into lines?\n\nSince the problem counts any line of 2 or more. For a run of three, that's two separate lines: the first two form a line, the middle two form another, and the last two as well? Or is each consecutive pair considered a line?\n\nWait, the lines can be any length ≥2; each continuous line is considered a single line if it's the same throughout. So if you have three in a column, it's just one line of length 3.\n\nWait, let me think. The problem says 'count the number of horizontal or vertical lines... with a length of 2 or more.' So each continuous line of same emojis counts as one, regardless of how long it is. So a line of three rhinos would be counted once, not multiple times.\n\nSo for the second column, it's a vertical line of three rhinos, so that's one line.\n\nWait, wait, but looking at line breaks—what about row 1 and 2? So the first column of that column is in row 1, and since the next row is same, yes. So the entire three rows are same so one line.\n\nNext, third column: 🦏, 🦟, 🐋, 🦟.\n\nRow1: 🦏\nRow2: 🦟\nRow3: 🐋\nRow4: 🦟\n\nSo from row1 to row2, different. Row2 to row3, different. Row3 to row4, different. So no vertical lines here.\n\nFourth column: 🏆, 🐋, 🦟, 🦞.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, let me recheck the board. The setup is given as:\n\nboard:\n🦏🦏🦏🦏\n🐋🦏🦟🐋\n🦞🦏🐋🦟\n🦏🐋🦟🦞\n\nSo the fourth row is 🦏🐋🦟🦞.\n\nAh right, so for the fourth column, the values are:\n\nRow1: 🦏\nRow2: 🐋\nRow3: 🦟\nRow4: 🦞\n\nAll different, so no vertical lines.\n\nWait, no—actually, no, the columns are:\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nEach row is 4 elements, columns are 1-4.\n\nColumn 1: row1: 🦏, row2: 🐋, row3: 🦞, row4: 🦏.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, let me re-examine all columns.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the second column. Let's list each column step by step.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow1: 🦏\n\nRow2: 🐋\n\nRow3: 🦞\n\nRow4: 🦏\n\nNo consecutive same.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow1: 🦏\n\nRow2: 🦏\n\nRow3: 🦏\n\nRow4: 🐋\n\nSo, in column 2, rows 1 to 3 are all 🦏. So that's a line of 3. So it counts as one line.\n\nWhat about column 3:\n\nRow1: 🦏\n\nRow2: 🦟\n\nRow3: 🐋\n\nRow4: 🦟\n\nSo each is different except for row4 possibly, but row3 is 🐋 and row4 is 🦟—no, so no vertical lines here.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow1: 🦏\n\nRow2: 🐋\n\nRow3: 🦟\n\nRow4: 🦞\n\nAll different.\n\nSo the vertical lines are from column 2.\n\nSo in vertical, only column 2 has a line of three, so that's 1.\n\nWhat about the horizontal lines? Earlier, I found only the first row had four in a row, so that's 1 line.\n\nWait, am I missing anything else?\n\nWait, perhaps I should check each row again for any 2+ consecutive.\n\nRow1: 🦏🦏🦏🦏 — it's four in a row. So that's a horizontal line of length 4; that counts as 1.\n\nRow2: 🐋🦏🦟🐋\n\nCheck for any consecutive duplicates:\n\nPosition 1 and 2: 🐋 vs 🦏 — no.\n\nPosition 2 and 3: 🦏 vs 🦟 — no.\n\nPosition 3 and 4: 🦟 vs 🐋 — no.\n\nSo no horizontal in row2.\n\nRow3: 🦞🦏🐋🦟\n\nAgain, check each adjacent pair. All different.\n\nRow4: 🦏🐋🦟🦞\n\nAll different apart from ?\n\nEach pair in a row—is there any?\n\nIn row4, 🦏, then 🐋, 🦟, 🦞. No duplicates.\n\nWait, wait no—the fourth row is 🦏🐋🦟🦞. So all four are unique. So no horizontal lines.\n\nWhat about the columns beyond column 2—are there any other columns with consecutive duplicates any where?\n\nFor column 4, the elements are row1: 🦏, row2: 🐋, row3: 🦟, row4: 🦞—no.\n\nWait, did I miss any other columns? Let me think again.\n\nFirst column: no.\n\nSecond column: found.\n\nNow, what about column3?\n\nRow1: 🦏\n\nRow2: 🦟\n\nRow3: 🐋\n\nRow4: 🦟?\n\nWait, no, row4 is 🐋🦟🦞? Wait, I'm getting myself confused.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all columns with their elements.\n\nLet me reconstruct the columns:\n\nColumn1:\nRow1: 🦏\nRow2: 🐋\nRow3: 🦞\nRow4: 🦏\n\nNo duplicates.\n\nColumn2:\nRow1: 🦏\nRow2: 🦏\nRow3: 🦏\nRow4: 🐋\n\nYes, rows 1-3 in column2 have same emoji.\n\nColumn3:\nRow1: 🦏\nRow2: 🦟\nRow3: 🐋\nRow4: 🦟\n\nNo cons\n\nWait, row4 is 🦟? Or is it something else.\n\nWait, fourth row is given as 🦏🐋🦟🦞. So row4, column4 is 🦞.\n\nSo for column3:\n\nRow1: 🦏 (from row1, third column)\nRow2: 🦟 (row2, third column)\nRow3: 🐋 (row3, third column)\nRow4: 🦟 (row4, third column)\n\nSo no duplicates here.\n\nWait, rows 2 and 4 are 🦟, but they are in the same column, consecutive? No. Between row2 and row3, 🦟 vs 🐋—different. Then row3 and row4: 🐋 vs 🦟—different again.\n\nSo no vertical lines in column3.\n\nColumn4:\nRow1: 🦏\nRow2: 🐋\nRow3: 🦟\nRow4: 🦞\n\nSo only column2 has a vertical line.\n\nSo overall, the horizontal line is in the first row—counts as 1.\n\nThe vertical line is column2—counts as 1.\n\nWait, but I might have made a mistake here. Let's double-check for horizontal lines.\n\nAnother approach: for each row, check all possible groups of two or more starting at each position.\n\nRow1: four same. So the only run that is 4, so it's one line.\n\nRow2: 🐋🦏🦟🐋. So any runs of two? No.\n\nRow3: 🦞🦏🐋🦟. No runs.\n\nRow4: 🦏🐋🦟🦞. No runs.\n\nSo only row1 has a horizontal line.\n\nNow, for vertical lines. Each column, scan top to bottom.\n\nColumn1: 🦏, 🐋, 🦞, 🦏. No runs.\n\nColumn2: 🦏, 🦏, 🦏, 🐋. Run starts at row1, continues to row2, row3. So a run of three. So counts as one vertical line.\n\nColumns3 and 4: nothing.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps I should consider if any of the columns have two separate runs. But I think that in column2, the run is continuous.\n\nWait, for example, could a column have a run of two in the middle? Like a run of two that is separated from another, but since runs are separated, they're considered different.\n\nFor column2: the three emojis at the top form a single line of length 3. Does the problem treat this as a single line regardless of how long it is beyond 2? Yes.\n\nSo 1 line from column2.\n\nSo so far, total lines = 1 (row1) +1 (col2) =2.\n\nWait, but wait—am I missing any other lines?\n\nAnother possible approach: for each cell, check all possible lines starting or passing through it, and mark if it's part of a line, but that might complicate.\n\nWait, perhaps I should also check the rows and columns again for runs of exactly 2 or more.\n\nWait, because sometimes in longer runs, the total is just one.\n\nSo, in row1, it's a run of 4, so counts as one.\n\nIn column2, runs of 3 rhinos, so one line.\n\nAre there any runs of exactly two in any rows or columns that I missed?\n\nLet me re-examine.\n\nRow2: 🐋🦏🦟🐋. Any runs of two?\n\nPosition 3 and 4: 🦟 and 🐋. No.\n\nPosition 1 and 4: 🐋 and 🐋 but they're not consecutive.\n\nWait, row2 starts with 🐋 and ends with 🐋 but they're not adjacent, so no.\n\nSo no lines there.\n\nRow3: 🦞, 🦏, 🐋, 🦟—all different.\n\nRow4: 🦏, 🐋, 🦟, 🦞—all different.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn2 already considered.\n\nOther columns don't have any runs.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed any 2-m runs in other columns.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nColumn2:\n\nrow2 is rhino, row3 is rhino—so row2 and 3 same. Wait, wait no: row1 is 🦏, row2: 🦏, row3: 🦏, row4: 🐋.\n\nYes, rows 1-3 in column2 are rhinos, so that's three in a row.\n\nAny other columns with runs of two? Let me see column1: 🦏, 🐋, 🦞, 🦏. So, row1 and row4 are both 🦏. Are they consecutive? No, because row1 is separated by rows in between. So no.\n\nColumn3: row1: 🦏, row2: 🦟, row3: 🐋, row4: 🦟. So row2 is 🦟, row4 is 🦟, but it's row2 and 4—no, not consecutive. So no runs of two even here.\n\nThus, for each column except column2, no vertical lines.\n\nSo overall, 1 horizontal line (row1) and 1 vertical line (column2). Total lines: 2.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering—am I missing the column4? Let me re-examine it.\n\nColumn4:\n\nrow1: 🦏 (rhino)\n\nrow2: 🐋 (whale)\n\nrow3: 🦟 (t-rex? Or another emoji, not sure the exact, but it's 🦟)\n\nrow4: 🦞 (lobster)\n\nSo, indeed, all different. So no runs.\n\nSo total lines: 2.\n\nWait a minute, but the initial problem says 'horizontal or vertical lines formed by same emoji with length of 2 or more.' So I think I've got that. So the answer is 2?\n\nWait, but wait—are there any diagonal lines to consider? The question says only horizontal or vertical, so no.\n\nSo, answer would be two lines.\n\nWait, but to double-check: row1 has a line of length four (counts as 1) and column2 has length three (counts as 1). So 2 total lines.\n\nBut wait, wait another thought: perhaps the vertical line in column2 is longer than two. But the problem counts each continuous line once. So regardless if it's longer than two, it's one line. So my count is correct.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more on a given 4x4 board. Each continuous block of the same emoji is considered a single line, regardless of its length beyond 2.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Horizontal Lines**:\n   - **Row 1**: 🦏🦏🦏🦏 — This is a continuous horizontal line of length 4, so it counts as 1 line.\n   - **Row 2**: 🐋🦏🦟🐋 — No consecutive emojis are the same, so no horizontal lines.\n   - **Row 3**: 🦞🦏🐋🦟 — No consecutive emojis are the same, so no horizontal lines.\n   - **Row 4**: 🦏🐋🦟🦞 — No consecutive emojis are the same, so no horizontal lines.\n\n   Total horizontal lines = 1.\n\n2. **Vertical Lines**:\n   - **Column 1**: 🦏, 🐋, 🦞, 🦏 — No consecutive emojis are the same, so no vertical lines.\n   - **Column 2**: 🦏, 🦏, 🦏, 🐋 — This is a continuous vertical line of length 3, so it counts as 1 line.\n   - **Column 3**: 🦏, 🦟, 🐋, 🦟 — No consecutive emojis are the same, so no vertical lines.\n   - **Column 4**: 🦏, 🐋, 🦟, 🦞 — No consecutive emojis are the same, so no vertical lines.\n\n   Total vertical lines = 1.\n\n3. **Total Lines**:\n   - Adding the horizontal and vertical lines gives a total of 1 + 1 = 2 lines.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 2"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

{"board":[["🌏","🌏","🌏","🐔"],["🐟","🌏","🐟","🐟"],["🐟","🐔","🌏","☁️"],["🌏","🌏","🌏","🌏"]],"response":["<think>\nOkay, so I've got this problem where I have to count horizontal and vertical lines on a board made of emojis. The lines must consist of the same emoji, with a length of at least two. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the board. The given board is:\n\n🌏🌏🌏🐔\n🐟🌏🐟🐟\n🐟🐔🌏☁️\n🌏🌏🌏🌏\n\nHmm, let me represent this as a grid with rows and columns. So each line is a row. I'll number the rows from top to bottom as 1 to 4, and columns from left to right as 1 to 4.\n\nRow 1: 🌏, 🌏, 🌏, 🐔\nRow 2: 🐟, 🌏, 🐟, 🐟\nRow 3: 🐟, 🐔, 🌏, ☁️\nRow 4: 🌏, 🌏, 🌏, 🌏\n\nNow, for each row, I need to check for horizontal lines. That means looking for consecutive same emojis in a row. Same goes for the vertical lines; I'll check each column for consecutive same emojis.\n\nStarting with horizontal lines:\n\nRow 1: 🌏, 🌏, 🌏, 🐔\nThe first three are the same. So that's a line of length 3. So count plus 1 here.\n\nRow 2: 🐟, 🌏, 🐟, 🐟\nLooking for consecutive. The last two are 🐟, which is a line of 2. So that's another count.\n\nRow 3: 🐟, 🐔, 🌏, ☁️\nNo consecutive here; all are different.\n\nRow 4: 🌏 four times. That's a line of 4, so that's another count.\n\nSo horizontal counts are 3 occurrences (from row 1, 2, and 4) but I have to see how many lines each row has.\n\nWait, no. Each contiguous line counts as one. So row one has a single horizontal line of length 3. That's one. Row two has a line of length 2, another. Row four has a line of length 4.\n\nSo total horizontal lines so far: 3 lines.\n\nWait, but maybe in a row, there are multiple. Like suppose in row 1, after the first three, if the fourth was same, it would lengthen the same line. But in this case, each row contributes only one horizontal line each if they have a single contiguous block.\n\nBut wait, row 4 has four in a row. That would count as one line of length ≥2.\n\nSo I'm counting each row's maximum line as one line. No, actually, no. Each maximal line segment counts as one line, regardless of its length. So if a row has a group of 3 same followed by a single same elsewhere, each counts as a separate line.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify the rules. Each horizontal line is a consecutive sequence of two or more same emojis in a row. So in a row, for each group of consecutive same emojis of length ≥2, that's one line per group.\n\nSo for row 1, the first three are the same as each other, so that's one line.\n\nRow 2: The first element is 🐟, then not, so that's a single. Third and fourth are 🐟, so that's another line—so in row 2, there's one horizontal line (of two).\n\nWait no: row 2 is 🐟 🌏 🐟 🐟\nSo in row 2, positions 3 and 4 are the same. So that's one horizontal line in row 2.\n\nRow 4: four in a row. So that's one line.\n\nThus in horizontal lines, each row can contribute as much as the number of groups with same emojis. So row 1: one, row 2: one, rows 3: none, row 4: one. So total horizontal lines: 3.\n\nWait, no. I think I made a mistake. Let me re-examine each row.\n\nRow 1: columns 1-3 are same. So whether they are all the same, so it's a single line. Hence, one line in row 1.\n\nRow 2: columns 3 and 4 same. So that's one line.\n\nRow 4: columns 1-4 same. One line.\n\nSo horizontal lines total 3.\n\nNow for vertical lines. I need to check each column across all rows for consecutive same emojis.\n\nEach column is 4 rows high. So for each column (four of them), I need to check each row's position in that column.\n\nColumn 1: Row1: 🌏, row2: 🐟, row3: 🐟, row4: 🌏. Let's list the emojis:\n\n🌏, 🐟, 🐟, 🌏\n\nSo looking between consecutive rows:\n\nRow1 to row2: 🌏 is different from 🐟.\n\nRow2 to row3: 🐟 same as 🐟. So that's a vertical line of length 2. So column 1 has at least one.\n\nRows 3 to 4: 🐟 different from 🌏. So column1 has a line of length 2, but which spans rows2 and 3. Wait, looking at this column: row2 is 🐟, row3 is 🐟—so that's a vertical line of 2. But also, any other lines?\n\nColumn1:\nrow1: 🌏\nrow2: 🐟\nrow3: 🐟\nrow4: 🌏\n\nSo in column1, between row2 and 3: two in a row. That's one vertical line.\n\nSo column 1 contributes one vertical line.\n\nNow, column2:\n\nRow1: 🌏\n\nRow2: 🌏 \n\nRow3: 🐔\n\nRow4: 🌏\n\nSo column2:\n\n🌏, 🌏, 🐔, 🌏\n\nSo row1 and 2 are same, which makes a vertical line of 2. Then skip, cause rows 2 and 3 are different, and rows3 and4 are different.\n\nSo column2 has a vertical line of length 2 (rows1-2). So that's a line, adding another count.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow1: 🌏\n\nRow2: 🐟\n\nRow3: 🌏\n\nRow4: 🌏\n\nHmm, let's see:\n\nRow1: 🌏, row2: 🐟, row3: 🌏, row4: 🌏.\n\nSo between row3 and 4: same 🌏. So that's a vertical line of 2. So column3 contributes one.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow1: 🐔\n\nRow2: 🐟\n\nRow3: ☁️\n\nRow4: 🌏\n\nAll different, so no vertical lines.\n\nWait, in column3: row3 🌏 and row4 🌏. So in column3, rows3 and 4 are same. So that adds another vertical line.\n\nAlso, looking at rows beyond 2:\n\nWait, are there any other vertical lines? Column2 also has rows1 and 2 as same. So that's another line.\n\nWait, I think I may have miscounted earlier.\n\nLet me recast all this.\n\nI'll go through each column and list the emojis in the column top to bottom, then find all consecutive runs of same emojis, each run with at least two.\n\nColumn1:\n🌏, 🐟, 🐟, 🌏\n\nSo in rows 2-3, 🐟. So a single vertical line here.\n\nColumn2:\n🌏, 🌏, 🐔, 🌏\n\nRows1-2: same → line of length 2.\n\nNo other runs in column2.\n\nColumn3:\n🌏, 🐟, 🌏, 🌏\n\nBetween row3 and4: two in a row → one line.\n\nAlso, looking deeper: any other lines in this column? Rows1 is 🌏, row2 is 🐟 (different), so nothing. So only rows3-4: +1.\n\nColumn4:\n🐔, 🐟, ☁️, 🌏 → all different, nothing.\n\nSo total vertical lines are 3.\n\nBecause as per columns, column1 has one, column2 has one, and column3 has another. That's 3.\n\nSo now, adding horizontal and vertical lines: 3 (horizontal) +3 (vertical) =6.\n\nWait but wait let me double-check.\n\nHorizontal lines and vertical lines—total of 3 each, so 6.\n\nAny I might have missed?\n\nWait, in row 4, the entire row is four same emojis, so that's one horizontal. Correct.\n\nHave I considered all possible vertical runs?\n\nWait column2: rows1 and2 same (🌏), but then row3 is 🐔, row4 is 🌏. So between rows1-2: one line; rows3-4: different.\n\nSo column2 gives one vertical line.\n\nSo vertical line counts are column1 (1), column2 (1), column3 (1)—so total 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo sum up: 3+3=6.\n\nWait, but what about the vertical line in column1: it's two emojis (rows 2-3), so one line.\n\nYes, that's all.\n\nWait, any line of longer than two. Like in row4, being four but contributes one line.\n\nSo yeah, the total is 6. The answer should be 6.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal and vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more, on the given board.

I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines on a given emoji board. The lines must be formed by the same emoji and have a length of 2 or more. Hmm, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I should understand the board structure. The board is a 4x4 grid since each line has four emojis. So rows go from top to bottom, columns from left to right.\n\nLet me write down the board as given:\n\nRow 0: 😄 😄 🦎 🦎\nRow 1: 😄 🌍 😄 🦎\nRow 2: 🌍 🤚 🌍 🌍\nRow 3: 🤚 🌍 🌍 😄\n\nWait, I'll index the rows as 0 to 3 for easier reference.\n\nI think I should process each row for horizontal lines and each column for vertical lines. Because a line can be either horizontal or vertical, so I need to check both directions.\n\nFor horizontal lines in each row:\nLooking for consecutive same emojis with length >=2.\n\nFor vertical lines in each column:\nCheck each column, see if any consecutive same emojis of length >=2 exist.\n\nI'll approach this step by step.\n\nStarting with horizontal lines:\n\nRow 0: 😄, 😄, 🦎, 🦎\nHere, the first two are 😄😄, which is length 2. Then 🦎🦎, also length 2. So that's two horizontal lines.\n\nRow 1: 😄, 🌍, 😄, 🦎\nEach consecutive pair? Let's see: 😄 and 🌍 are different. Then 🌍 and 😄: different. 😄 and 🦎: different. So no horizontal lines in row 1.\n\nRow 2: 🌍, 🤚, 🌍, 🌍\nLooking for consecutive runs. The first two: 🌍 and 🤚 are different. Next, 🤚 and 🌍: different. Then 🌍 and 🌍: same, so that's a line of length 2. So one horizontal line here.\n\nRow 3: 🤚, 🌍, 🌍, 😄\nFirst two: 🤚 and 🌍 are different. Then 🌍 and 🌍: same, so another line of 2. Then 🌍 and 😄: different. So that's one horizontal line.\n\nSo total horizontal lines: 2 (from row 0) + 0 (row1) +1 (row2) +1 (row3) = 4.\n\nNow for vertical lines, need to check each column.\n\nColumn 0:\nRow0: 😄\nRow1: 😄\nRow2: 🌍\nRow3: 🤚\n\nCheck vertically: the first two are same? 😄 and 😄: yes. So that's a line of 2. Then the next entries are different. So that's one vertical line in column 0.\n\nBut wait, wait. In a vertical line, we need consecutive in the column, so how?\n\nLooking in column 0:\n\nRow0 and row1: both 😄, that's two in a line. So that's a line.\n\nRow1 and row2: 😄 vs 🌍: no.\n\nRow2 and row3: 🌍 vs 🤚: no.\n\nSo only one line in column0.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow0: 😄\nRow1: 🌍\nRow2: 🤚\nRow3: 🌍\n\nAll rows of column1: different from each other. No lines here.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: 🦎\nRow1: 😄\nRow2: 🌍\nRow3: 🌍\n\nLooking for consecutive:\n\nRow2 and row3: 🌍 and 🌍: same. So that's a vertical line of length 2. Any longer? No.\n\nSo that's one line in column2.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🦎\nRow1: 🦎\nRow2: 🌍\nRow3: 😄\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\nRow0 and row1: 🦎 and 🦎: same. So that's a vertical line of 2. Rows1 and 2 are different. Rows2 and 3: different. So that's one line.\n\nSo vertical lines per column: column0 (1), column2 (1), column3 (1): total 3.\n\nWait, what about columns longer than two? Like, for a line of 3 or 4 same, but I think color doesn't have any in this case.\n\nSo total vertical lines: 3.\n\nThen total lines is horizontal (4) + vertical (3) =7.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, are vertical lines any runs of length >= 2? So in column0, row0 and row1 are same: that's one line (length2). Then what about if there's a longer line. For example, if 3, that counts as two lines (since length 2 is counted once, but two overlapping lines). Hmm, but the problem states lines of length 2 or more but each line is counted once regardless of how long it is? Or do I count each occurrence. That is, in a column of 3 same symbols, like row0, row1, row2 same, would that count as two lines (row0-1 and row1-2)?\n\nWait, no, the question says \"lines formed by the same emoji\", so a run of 3 is considered one line of length3, not two separate lines. So for the purpose of this problem, each maximal sequence in a row or column counts as one line.\n\nWait, in row0, two separate lines: 😄,😄 and 🦎, 🦎. Each is length2, but they are separate so they count as two. Similarly, in column0, the line is just the two 😄, so counts as one.\n\nI think I was correct earlier.\n\nSo back to vertical column evaluation.\n\nWait, in column3: row0 and row1 are same (🦎), so that's one line. So column3 contributes 1.\n\nIn column2: row2 and row3 are same, which contributes one.\n\nIn column0: rows 0 and 1 same, one line.\n\nSo vertical lines: 3.\n\nSo total lines: horizontal 4 + vertical 3 =7.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each row.\n\nFor horizontal again:\n\nRow0: two separate lines (positions 0-1 and 2-3), that's 2 lines.\n\nRow1: no lines.\n\nRow2: positions 3-4? No, positions 2-3: same (🌍), so one line.\n\nRow3: positions1-2 of the row are same (🌍);\n\nWait, row3 is:\n\nIndex 0: 🤚\n\nIndex1: 🌍\n\nIndex2: 🌍\n\nindex3: 😄\n\nSo the emojis from indexes1 to 2: 🌍🌍, that's one line. Correct.\n\nSo 4 horizontal lines.\n\nSo horizontal 4, vertical 3. Answer is 7.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.

I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines on the given emoji board where the line is made up of the same emoji and has a length of 2 or more. Hmm, so the board is a 4x4 grid. I'll try to visualize each row and column and check for consecutive emojis of the same type.\n\nLet me write down each row first. Maybe going row by row and then column by column.\n\nSo the board is:\n\nRow 0: 🦍 🌻 🦍 🐈\nRow 1: 🦍 🌷 🌻 🌻\nRow 2: 🐈 🌷 🌷 🌷\nRow 3: 🌻 🌷 🐈 🌻\n\nWait, maybe I should number the rows from top to bottom as rows 0 to 3, each having 4 columns (columns 0 to 3). That makes it easier to track.\n\nStarting with horizontal lines. I'll go through each row and check for consecutive same emojis, with a run of 2 or more.\n\nRow 0: 🦍, 🌻, 🦍, 🐈. Let's see. 🦍 followed by 🌻 (different), then 🦍 and 🐈. So no horizontal lines in row 0. No runs of 2 or more.\n\nRow 1: 🦍, 🌷, 🌻, 🌻. So positions 0 is 🦍 alone. Position 1 is 🌷, then position 2 and 3 are 🌻🌻. That's a run of 2. So that's one horizontal line here. So this row contributes one.\n\nRow 2: 🐈, 🌷, 🌷, 🌷. Let's see. First element is 🐈, then next three are 🌷. So from position 1 to 3, that's a run of 3, which is more than 2. So that's a horizontal line of length 3. So this row contributes one (since it's a single line of 3). But wait, during the scan, how do I count it? Well, the entire sequence from 1 to 3 is a single line, not multiple. So it counts as 1 line. But wait, in some problems, sometimes people count the number of possible lines within the run. But I think in this context, each continuous run is one line, regardless of the length as long as it's >=2. So, the answer would be 1 line in row 2.\n\nRow 3: 🌻, 🌷, 🐈, 🌻. All are different, so no lines.\n\nSo from horizontal lines, we have row 1 contributing 1 and row 2 contributing 1, so total of 2 so far.\n\nNow vertical lines. This is a bit trickier. I need to go through each column and check for consecutive same emojis. So I'll check each column's elements from row 0 to row 3.\n\nColumn 0:\nRow0: 🦍\nRow1: 🦍\nRow2: 🐈\nRow3: 🌻\nLooking at these, row0 and row1 are both 🦍, so that's two in a row, which is length 2. So that's a vertical line. So column 0 contributes 1.\n\nNow the next emojis are 🐈 and 🌻 which don't continue the 🦍, so that's all for column 0.\n\nColumn 1:\nRow0: 🌻\nRow1: 🌷\nRow2: 🌷\nRow3: 🌷\nLet's see. Row0 is 🌻. Then row1 is 🌷. No. Starting from row1, three 🌷 in a row from rows 1,2,3—so that's a line of length 3. So column1 has one vertical line.\n\nColumn 2:\nRow0: 🦍\nRow1: 🌻\nRow2: 🌷\nRow3: 🐈\nAll different, so no lines.\n\nColumn3:\nRow0: 🐈\nRow1: 🌻\nRow2: 🌷\nRow3: 🌻\nSo no runs. Row0 is 🐈, row1 is 🌻, then row2 is 🌷, row3 again 🌻. No two same in a row.\n\nSo vertical lines: column0 contributes1, column1 contributes1.\n\nSo total vertical lines are 2.\n\nAdding to the horizontal lines (2), the total lines are 2+2=4.\n\nWait, no, because the total so far is horizontal 2, vertical 2. So total 4?\n\nWait, let me recheck each part carefully.\n\nCheck horizontal again:\n\nRow0: 🦍, 🌻, 🦍, 🐈. Only single emojis. No lines.\n\nRow1: 🦍, 🌷, 🌻, 🌻. The last two are same. So one line in this row.\n\nRow2: 🐈, 🌷, 🌷, 🌷. Three in a row. So one line.\n\nRow3: No same adjacent.\n\nSo horizontal count is 2.\n\nVertical:\n\nColumn0:\n\nRows 0 and 1 are 🦍, same. So that's a line of length 2.\n\nRow2 and 3 have different emojis. So only one vertical line here.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow1 is 🌷, rows 2,3 are 🌷 as well. So from row1 to row3, that's three in a row. So a line of length 3. So that's one vertical line in column1.\n\nOther columns: columns2 and3 have no runs.\n\nSo vertical count is 2.\n\nTotal so far: 2+2=4.\n\nWait, but let me think again for column1. Are the three in a row considered a single line. So 3-length line is counted as one unit.\n\nDoes that fit the problem statement? Yes. The line is a continuous run of same emojis of length >=2.\n\nSo each such run counts as one line.\n\nTherefore, vertical lines count 2.\n\nSo total lines 4.\n\nHold on, but in the board given:\n\nLet me recount.\n\nWait, in the board:\n\nRow2 is 🐈, 🌷, 🌷, 🌷. So that's a horizontal line of 3. Which is one line. Correct.\n\nRow1 has 🌻, 🌻. One line.\n\nSo total horizontal 2.\n\nVertical lines:\n\nColumn0: row0 and row1 are 🦍. So one line.\n\nColumn1 has row1,2,3 as 🌷. So that's a single vertical line (length3). So count as one line.\n\nSo vertical total 2.\n\nSo overall, 4 as the answer.\n\nBut wait, let's think again—are we missing any possible horizontal runs longer than 3? No, the rows can't have more.\n\nBut, wait, maybe I'm missing that some columns have longer runs, but each run is only counted once, even if it's longer.\n\nBut wait, perhaps another approach. For each possible line of length >=2, whether in row or column, count it once.\n\nFor example, in column1, the three emojis form a single line of length 3, which we count once.\n\nSo based on that, total of 4 lines.\n\nWait, but are there any more lines?\n\nWait, in column1, is the 🌷 run from row1 to row3 continuous? Yes. So it's one line.\n\nIn column0, the first two rows are 🦍, so run of two, which is one line.\n\nIn row2, the three 🌷 make one line.\n\nIn row1, the two 🌻 make one line.\n\nSo 2+2=4.\n\nIs that all?\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps another check.\n\nLooking again:\n\nIn row 1, is there any other run? No.\n\nIn row 0, no.\n\nIn row3, no.\n\nIn the vertical columns:\n\nIn column1, from row1 to row3, same.\n\nIn column2, no consecutive same.\n\nWait, in column1, rows 1,2,3: that's a single run. So yes.\n\nSo total four lines.\n\nWait, let me make sure.\n\nBut I might have missed a vertical line somewhere else.\n\nCheck each column:\n\nColumn0:\n\nRow0: 🦍\n\nRow1: 🦍 → same as row0. Combine to a run of 2.\n\nRow2: 🐈 → different.\n\nSo one line here.\n\nIs there a longer run? No, only two.\n\nSo one line.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRows1: starts with 🌷, rows2 and 3 are same.\n\nSo rows1-3: 🌷, 🌷, 🌷 → a run of 3.\n\nSo one line.\n\nNow, is there another run in the same column?\n\nNo, since rows above or below are different.\n\nThus, column1 contributes one line.\n\nColumn2:\n\nCheck for runs.\n\nRow0 is 🦍, row1 🌻, row2 🌷, row3 🐈. All different, so no runs.\n\nColumn3: \n\nRow0:🐈, row1:🌻, row2:🌷, row3:🌻.\n\nNo two in a row.\n\nSo only columns0 and1 contribute with vertical lines.\n\nThus, total lines 2 (horizontal) +2 (vertical)=4.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Wait a minute, column one's three emojis: the run is 3. So that's a longer line, which would count as one. So it's okay.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me list each line.\n\nHorizontal:\n\nRow1: positions 2 and 3 → 🌻🌻 (length 2).\n\nRow2: positions 1,2,3 → 🌷🌷🌷 (length 3).\n\nVertical:\n\nColumn0: positions 0 and1 → 🦍🦍 (length 2).\n\nColumn1: positions1,2,3 → 🌷🌷🌷 (length 3).\n\nThat's four lines in total.\n\nOkay, so the answer is 4.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines on a 4x4 emoji board where each line is formed by the same emoji and has a length of 2 or more. \n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Horizontal Lines**:\n   - **Row 0**: `🦍 🌻 🦍 🐈`  \n     No consecutive emojis are the same.  \n     Contribution: 0 lines.\n   - **Row 1**: `🦍 🌷 🌻 🌻`  \n     The last two emojis (`🌻🌻`) form a line of length 2.  \n     Contribution: 1 line.\n   - **Row 2**: `🐈 🌷 🌷 🌷`  \n     The last three emojis (`🌷🌷🌷`) form a line of length 3.  \n     Contribution: 1 line.\n   - **Row 3**: `🌻 🌷 🐈 🌻`  \n     No consecutive emojis are the same.  \n     Contribution: 0 lines.\n   - **Total Horizontal Lines**: 2.\n\n2. **Vertical Lines**:\n   - **Column 0**:  \n     - `🦍` (Row 0), `🦍` (Row 1) → Same emoji for 2 rows.  \n     Contribution: 1 line.\n     - Rows 2 and 3 have different emojis.  \n   - **Column 1**:  \n     - `🌷` (Row 1), `🌷` (Row 2), `🌷` (Row 3) → Same emoji for 3 rows.  \n     Contribution: 1 line.\n   - **Column 2**:  \n     - `🦍` (Row 0), `🌻` (Row 1), `🌷` (Row 2), `🐈` (Row 3) → All different.  \n     Contribution: 0 lines.\n   - **Column 3**:  \n     - `🐈` (Row 0), `🌻` (Row 1), `🌷` (Row 2), `🌻` (Row 3) → No consecutive same emojis.  \n     Contribution: 0 lines.\n   - **Total Vertical Lines**: 2.\n\n3. **Total Lines**:  \n   Adding the horizontal and vertical lines gives a total of 2 (horizontal) + 2 (vertical) = 4 lines.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 4"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

{"board":[["🐫","🌲","🐫","🌍"],["🌍","🌲","🐓","🐓"],["🐫","🐫","🐓","🌲"],["🌍","🌲","🌲","🌲"]],"response":["<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have this rectangular board made up of various emojis, and our task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, where each line has a length of 2 or more. \n\nHmm, first I should visualize the board provided. Let me write it down to make sure I don't miss any details. The board is given as:\n\nRow 1: 🐫 🌲 🐫 🌍\nRow 2: 🌍 🌲 🐓 🐓\nRow 3: 🐫 🐫 🐓 🌲\nRow 4: 🌍 🌲 🌲 🌲\n\nSo the board has 4 rows and 4 columns each.\n\nNow, I need to count all lines (either horizontal or vertical) of the same emoji with length >= 2. Let me plan how to approach this.\n\nI think the best way is to check each row and each column for consecutive emojis. For each row, I'll scan each position and see how many consecutive same emojis there are, and if they form a line of 2 or more. Similarly, I'll do the same for each column, checking vertically.\n\nWait, but I need to be careful not to count the same line multiple times. For example, if in a row there are three same emojis in a row, how many lines is that? Let's see: the three could form a line of length 3, which is one line, but actually, that line comprises multiple segments, but wait, according to the problem, each contiguous group of same emojis, regardless of how long, counts as one line. Or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the question is to count each line, which is a contiguous segment of the same emoji, either horizontal or vertical, of length ≥2.\n\nSo for example, in a row like ['A','A','A'], it has one horizontal line of length 3. So I think that's one count, not considering that it's made up of smaller lines. So the approach should be to count each distinct maximal segment (meaning the longest possible consecutive sequence that can't be extended) in each row and column.\n\nSo for each row, I'll go through each cell and see the maximum consecutive same emojis to the right (for horizontal) and below (for vertical). Wait, but that's a bit vague. Let's think about a more methodical way.\n\nI'll process each row first:\n\nProcessing each row:\n\nRow 1: 🐫 🌲 🐫 🌍\n- Check horizontally:\n  - 🐫 and next is 🌲: different, so no line.\n  - 🌲 next is 🐫: different. \n  - 🐫 next is 🌍: different.\n  So no horizontal lines in row 1.\n\nRow 2: 🌍 🌲 🐓 🐓\n- Check horizontally:\n  - 🌍 is single. After that, 🌲, then 🐓 and 🐓.\n  So the last two 🐓 are a line of length 2: count 1.\n\nRow 3: 🐫 🐫 🐓 🌲\n- Check horizontally:\n  - First two 🐫: so that's a line of 2: count 1.\n  Then 🐓 and 🌲: nothing else.\n\nRow 4: 🌍 🌲 🌲 🌲\n- Check horizontally:\n  From the third column, we have 🌲. Let's see:\n  - Columns 2-4: 🌲 appears three times. So that's a line of 3: count as 1.\n\nSo from the rows, that's 3 lines.\n\nNow processing the columns, looking for vertical lines:\n\nColumn 1: 🐫 🌍 🐫 🌍\nLooking vertically:\n- Let's see: each element in column 1 is [🐫, 🌍, 🐫, 🌍].\nSo check from top to bottom:\n- Rows 1 and 2: 🐫 and 🌍: different. \n- 🌍 and 🐫: different.\n- 🐫 and 🌍: different.\nNo vertical lines here.\n\nColumn 2: 🌲 🌲 🐫 🌲\nLet's see from top to bottom:\n- Row 1: 🌲\n- Row 2: 🌲: same as above? No, row 1 is 🌲, row 2 is 🌲— wait wait, wait. Wait column 2 is (row 1: 🌲, row2:🌲, row3:🐫, row4:🌲. Wait, no, let me check the original board:\n\nWait the board is:\n\nRow1: 🐫 🌲 🐫 🌍\nRow2: 🌍 🌲 🐓 🐓\nRow3: 🐫 🐫 🐓 🌲\nRow4: 🌍 🌲 🌲 🌲\n\nSo column 2 is:\nRow1: 🌲\nRow2: 🌲\nRow3: 🐫\nRow4: 🌲\n\nLooking for vertical lines in each position:\n\nCheck consecutive same emojis vertically.\n\nSo looking from top to bottom for column 2:\n\nRow1 🌲, row2 🌲: so two same in a row. That's a vertical line of length 2: count 1.\n\nRow2 is 🌲, row3 is 🐫: different. Then row3 is 🐫, row4 is 🌲: different. So only one line here.\n\nSo in column 2, we have 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn 3: 🐫 🐓 🐓 🌲\nWait, let's check each cell:\n\nWait column 3 is for each row:\n\nRow1: 🐫\nRow2: 🐓\nRow3: 🐓\nRow4: 🌲\n\nLooking for vertical lines:\n\nBetween row2 and row3: 🐓 (row2) and 🐓 (row3)—so that's two in a vertical line: count 1.\n\nSo in column3, one vertical line.\n\nColumn4: 🌍 🐓 🌲 🌲\nCheck each row:\n\nRow1: 🌍 \nRow2: 🐓\nRow3: 🌲\nRow4: 🌲\n\nLooking for vertical runs:\n\n_row4 has 🌲 and row3 also 🌲? No, row3 has 🌲, row4 also 🌲. So that's two in a vertical line.\n\nWait, let me see: row3:4th column is 🌲, row4 same. So that's two together: so vertical line of length 2: so one count.\n\nWait so column4, count 1.\n\nSo from the columns, we have column2:1, column3:1, column4:1. So 3 counts.\n\nNow total so far: rows had 3, columns had 3: 6.\n\nWait, but wait: in column4, I think I may have missed another line. Let me recheck. Column4:\n\nRow1: 🌍, row2: 🐓: different from row1.\n\nThen, row3: 🌲, row4: 🌲. So that's 2 in a row between row3 and row4: count 1.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think: when we process each line in the rows and each column, are there any overlaps? Or are the counts separate. Because a line in a row doesn't affect the lines in columns. So for example, the line in row4, 🌲🌲🌲, is counted once for horizontal, but any vertical lines in that column would be a separate count.\n\nWait another point: I should make sure that I'm not double-counting any line, but in this case, horizontal and vertical lines are in different orientations, so each one is counted once.\n\nWait, wait. For rows, the lines are horizontal, and for columns, vertical: no overlapping, so they can be simply added together.\n\nWait, rows:3, columns:3. So total 6 lines? But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount.\n\nLet me list out each instance.\n\nFirst, rows:\n\nRow2: the last two emojis are 🐓🐓: horizontal, length 2 → count 1.\n\nRow3: first two 🐫🐫: horizontal, length2 → count1.\n\nRow4: last three are 🌲🌲🌲: length3 → count1.\n\nSo rows contribute 3 lines.\n\nNow columns:\n\nColumn2: row1 🌲 and row2 🌲: same, so vertical line length2 → count1.\n\nColumn3: row2🐓 and row3🐓 → count1.\n\nColumn4: row3🌲 and row4🌲 → count1.\n\nSo columns contribute 3 lines. So total 6.\n\nBut wait, in column4 rows 3 and4: both are 🌲. So that's another line, count1.\n\nTherefore total is 3 (rows) + 3 (columns) = 6.\n\nWait, but when I first processed the columns, I thought column4 would have 1, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, processing column4:\n\nRow1: 🌍\nRow2: 🐓\nRow3: 🌲\nRow4: 🌲\n\nSo the only vertical lines are between row3 and4. So that's one line.\n\nYes.\n\nSo total lines: 3+3=6?\n\nWait, but wait no: I think I might have missed a vertical line in column2. Let's see column2 again:\n\nColumn2 is 🌲 (row1), 🌲 (row2), 🐫 (row3), 🌲 (row4).\n\nWhich has a vertical line of two 🌲 in a column: between row1 and 2.\n\nThus, count1.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nWait, another thing to check: in row4, the horizontal line is length3, which is count1. Any other line in the same row? No. So the count is correct.\n\nWait, now I think I have 3+3=6 lines. So the answer should be 6.\n\nWait wait, but something's not quite adding up. Let me make a grid to process the rows and columns systematically.\n\nProcessing rows:\n\nEach row, check each possible run of two or more same emojis.\n\nRow1:\n🐫 🌲 🐫 🌍\n\nCheck index 0: 🐫; next is 🌲 → different. Length 1: no.\n\nIndex 1: 🌲; next is 🐫 → different: no.\n\nIndex 2: 🐫; next is 🌍 → different: no.\n\nSo nothing.\n\nSo count: 0.\n\nRow2:\n🌍 🌲 🐓 🐓\n\nCheck indices 0: 🌍, next is 🌲 → different. Length 1: no.\n\nIndex1: 🌲 → next is 🐓 → different: no.\n\nIndex2: 🐓 → next is 🐓: same. So run starts at index2, length2. Count1.\n\nSo row2 contributes 1.\n\nRow3:\n🐫 🐫 🐓 🌲\n\nCheck index0: 🐫, next is 🐫 → same. Run length2 → count1.\n\nIndex1: 🐫 → next is 🐓 → different.\n\nIndex2: 🐓 → next is 🌲 → different. So this row gives 1.\n\nRow4:\n🌍 🌲 🌲 🌲\n\nCheck index0: 🌍 → next is 🌲 → different.\n\nIndex1: 🌲 next is 🌲 → same. Count increases by run length >=2.\n\nWait, let me process this row correctly.\n\nStart from index0: 🌍 next different, so nothing.\n\nIndex1: 🌲. Compare to next (index2: 🌲). Same.\n\nSo run starts at index1: continue.\n\nHow far does it go? From index1, index2 and 3 are 🌲.\n\nSo run length is 3 (positions 1,2,3). So that's a line of length3, contributing 1.\n\nHence, row4 contributes 1.\n\nSo total rows: 1 (row2) +1 (row3) +1 (row4) =3.\n\nNow columns.\n\nI will process each column and look for runs of >=2 in vertical arrangement.\n\nColumn1:\nRow1 🐫\nRow2 🌍\nRow3 🐫\nRow4 🌍\n\nCheck for vertical runs.\n\nRow1 and Row2: 🐫 and 🌍: different.\n\nRow2 and 3: 🌍, 🐫: no.\n\nRow3 and4: 🐫, 🌍: no.\n\nSo column1: no runs.\n\nColumn2:\nRow1 🌲\nRow2 🌲\nRow3 🐫\nRow4 🌲\n\nCheck each consecutive pair.\n\nRows1-2: 🌲 and 🌲 → same. So vertical run of length2: count1.\n\nRow2 and3: 🌲 and 🐫: no.\n\nRow3 and4: 🐫 and 🌲: no.\n\nSo column2 contributes 1.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow1: 🐫\nRow2: 🐓\nRow3: 🐓\nRow4: 🌲\n\nCheck vertical runs:\n\nRows1-2: 🐫 vs 🐓: no.\n\nRows2-3: 🐓 and 🐓 → same. So run length2: count1.\n\nRows3-4: 🐓 vs 🌲: no.\n\nSo column3 contributes 1.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow1: 🌍\nRow2: 🐓\nRow3: 🌲\nRow4: 🌲\n\nCheck each pair:\n\nRow1-2: 🌍 vs 🐓 → no.\nRow2-3: 🐓 vs 🌲 → no.\nRow3-4: 🌲 vs 🌲 → same. So run length2 → count1.\n\nSo column4 contributes 1.\n\nThus, columns' contribution is columns 2,3,4: 1 each → total3.\n\nHence total lines: rows (3) + columns (3) = 6.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought the answer might be 7, but now it's 6.\n\nWait let me suddenly wonder if there's another line I missed.\n\nWait, looking at row3 and column3? Let me think again.\n\nWait, in row3: we have 🐫 🐫 🐓 🌲 → so the first two are same.\n\nAnd in column3, the middle has two 🐓 in row2 and 3.\n\nSo, no overlap assigned. So all lines are correctly counted.\n\nWait another thought: let me check if I've considered all possible lines.\n\nLet me see for example column4, row3-4: 🌲🌲. So that's one line, and in row4, the 🌲 occurs in the sequence of 3 (columns2-4). So row4's line is a single line of three, which counts once.\n\nBut wait, in row4, it's a horizontal line that goes from column2 to column4, which is three in a row. So count1.\n\nColumn4 has two at the bottom, so count1.\n\nSo all seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the total should be 6.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji on a 4x4 board, where each line has a length of 2 or more. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Horizontal Lines**: \n   - For each row, scan through the emojis to identify contiguous segments of the same emoji with a length of 2 or more.

{"board":[["🐣","🐣","🐏","🐏"],["🐣","🐏","🎋","🐏"],["🎋","🐣","🎋","🐜"],["🎋","🐣","🐣","🐣"]],"response":["<think>\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have a rectangular board made up of emojis, and I have to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji. The lines must have a length of 2 or more. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the board. The board is 4x4, right? So it's four rows and four columns. Each cell contains an emoji. Let me rewrite it to make it clearer.\n\nRow 1: 🐣 🐣 🐏 🐏\nRow 2: 🐣 🐏 🎋 🐏\nRow 3: 🎋 🐣 🎋 🐜\nRow 4: 🎋 🐣 🐣 🐣\n\nWait, maybe I should represent it as columns to make it easier for checking vertical lines. But perhaps for each direction, I'll handle rows and columns separately.\n\nI think the best approach is to go through each possible line segment in both directions and check if it meets the criteria.\n\nLet's start by checking horizontal lines. For each row, I need to look for consecutive same emojis across the columns. The minimum length is 2, so any consecutive sequence of 2 or more same emojis in a row counts as one line.\n\nWait, but do overlapping lines count multiple times? Like, if three same emojis are in a row, how many lines does that count? Well, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with length 2 or more.\" So for three in a row, the possible lines would be positions 1-2, 2-3, but wait, no. The entire three is a single line of length 3, which counts as one. Or, does it count each possible consecutive part? Wait, no, because each line is a continuous sequence. So for three in a row, it's just one line. But for two consecutive pairs, like four in a row, you might have multiple lines.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to look for the maximum possible line segments in any direction, but each maximum-length segment counts as just one line, but when there are longer sequences, like a line of 3, it counts as one line, not two (like 2-length and 3). Or maybe, each possible starting point for a line >=2 counts as a line as long as it's a consecutive run. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again. It says to count the number of lines formed by same emoji with length 2 or more. So a line is a consecutive sequence of at least two same emojis in a horizontal or vertical line. So for a row like A A A:\n\nIn row 1, if there are three A's in a row, it counts as one line of length 3. But, when counting, it's considered as a single line. So, the number of lines is 1, not 2 (like the individual runs of length 2 and 3). Or is the count supposed to be the number of possible runs of length >=2?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me clarify with an example. Think of a row of 4 same emojis: let's say all A's. How many lines are there in that row?\n\nIn this case, I think each possible horizontal line of length 2 or more counts as one line. So, in a row of 4 A's, how many such lines are there? Well, for a row, lines can be any segment of length >=2. So the possible lines are:\n\n- starting at position 1: length 2, 3, 4\n- starting at position 2: length 2, 3\n- starting at position 3: length 2\n\nSo total is 3 (from pos1) + 2 (pos2) +1 (pos3) = 6? But that seems high.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem counts the maximal lines. That is, a line must be as long as possible; that way, overlapping regions are not counted multiple times. So for a row of 4 A's, it's just 1 line, since it's one solid block of 4. But that may not be the case.\n\nWait, let's see some example that might make it clearer. For example, the sample input:\n\nLooking at row 1: 🐣 🐣 🐏 🐏\n\nSo for row 1, the first two are 🐣, so that's one horizontal line. Then the last two are 🐏, so another horizontal line. So in row 1, we have two horizontal lines of length 2 each.\n\nNow, looking at row 4: 🎋 🐣 🐣 🐣. So the last three are 🐣, which is one line. So that's one line of length 3. But in that same row, the middle two (positions 2 and 3) are 🐣, and 3 and 4, but they are part of the longer line. So would that count as one line or multiple?\n\nI think the correct approach is that any consecutive run of the same emoji with length >=2 counts as one line per such run, regardless of overlaps. So in row 4, the three 🐣s form a single line of length 3, which is longer than 2. So it counts as 1 line, even though within it, there are two possible subruns of length 2.\n\nWait, but that wouldn't make sense if the question is asking for all possible lines. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, the question is to count the number of maximal runs. So a maximal run cannot be extended on either side, meaning that a single run is considered one line. So in that case, each group counts once.\n\nNo, wait, I'm not sure. Let me think of your own small example.\n\nIf a row is [A, A, A], how many lines are there? According to the problem:\n\nIn this row, all three are the same. So we can have horizontal lines starting at position 1 (length 2 and 3), and position 2 (length 2). But if the problem counts each possible line, then that would be 2 lines (length 2 and 3). Alternatively, the maximal line is considered, so only 1 line (length 3) is counted.\n\nI think the problem counts each run where all the emojis are the same, and the length is 2 or more. So the maximal run is one line. Because when a run is longer, it's only counted as a single line of the maximum possible length.\n\nWait, let's look back to the problem statement:\n\n\"the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\"\n\nSo, each line is a group of same emojis in a straight line, either horizontal or vertical, and each such group with count as one line, regardless of its length (as long as it's >=2).\n\nWait no, that might not be the case. Each continuous segment counts as one line. So, for instance, in row 4 of the sample board, the three 🐣 count as one line of length 3, so count 1.\n\nThen, in row 1, the 🐣's form a horizontal line of 2, so +1, and the 🐏's form another horizontal line of 2, +1, so row 1 contributes 2.\n\nLet me proceed with this understanding, because perhaps that's the case.\n\nNow, let's look at the sample input and count all horizontal and vertical lines.\n\nFirst, I'll process each row for horizontal lines.\n\nRow 1: 🐣 🐣 🐏 🐏\nThe row is s1 s2 s3 s4.\nLooking for consecutive same emojis.\n\n🐣 and 🐣: positions 1-2, length 2 → count as 1 line.\n🐏 and 🐏: positions 3-4, length 2 → count as 1 line. So row 1 contributes 2.\n\nRow 2: 🐣 🐏 🎋 🐏\nCheck horizontal:\nPosition 1 is 🐣, next is 🐏 → no.\nPosition 2: 🐏, next 🎋 → no.\nPosition 3: 🎋, next 🐏 → no.\nSo Row 2 has 0 horizontal lines.\n\nRow 3: 🎋 🐣 🎋 🐜\nCheck horizontal:\nPosition 1: 🎋, next is 🐣 → no.\nPos 2: 🐣, next 🎋 → no.\nPos 3: 🎋, next 🐜 → no. So row3 contributes 0.\n\nRow 4: 🎋 🐣 🐣 🐣\nCheck horizontal:\nPos2: 🐣, next 🐣 → positions 2-3, length 2 → but pos3 is followed by pos4 🐣 → so entire row from pos2 to pos4 is 3. So one line in row4.\n\nSo total horizontal lines are 2 (row1) + 0 (row2) + 0 (row3) + 1 (row4) = 3 so far.\n\nNow for the vertical lines. These are consecutive same emojis in the same column, across rows.\n\nWe need to examine each column, and for each, check for same emojis in consecutive rows.\n\nWe have 4 columns as well. Let's index columns from 1 to 4.\n\nColumn 1:\nRow1: 🐣\nRow2: 🐣\nRow3: 🎋\nRow4: 🎋\n\nSo, looking vertically:\n- Row1 and Row2: both 🐣 → vertical line of length 2 → count 1.\n- Rows 3 and 4: both 🎋 → vertical line of length 2 → count 1.\n- Are there longer lines? No. Because after row2, it's 🎋 in row3, which is different from 🐣. So column1 has two vertical lines of length 2 each → +2 lines.\n\nColumn2:\nRow1: 🐣\nRow2: 🐏\nRow3: 🐣\nRow4: 🐣\n\nLooking vertically:\nRow3 and Row4: same (🐣), so a vertical line of length 2 → count 1.\nRow2? No consecutive same. Row1 is different from row2, row2 is different from row3, etc. So column2 contributes 1.\n\nColumn3:\nRow1: 🐏\nRow2: 🎋\nRow3: 🎋\nRow4: 🐣?\n\nWait:\n\nRow1: 🐏\nRow2: 🎋\nRow3: 🎋\nRow4: 🐣\n\nSo check vertically:\n\nRow2 and row3: both 🎋 → vertical line of length 2 → count 1.\n\nOther positions: row1 is 🐏, different from row2. row3 is 🎋, same as row2. row4 is 🐣, different from row3. So column3 contributes 1.\n\nColumn4:\nRow1: 🐏\nRow2: 🐏\nRow3: 🐜\nRow4: 🐣\n\nLooking vertically:\n\nRow1 and row2: same 🐏 → vertical line of length 2 → +1.\nOther positions: row2 is 🐏, row3 is 🐜 → different. row3 and row4: different. So column4 contributes 1.\n\nSo vertical lines: column1 (2) + column2 (1) + column3 (1) + column4 (1) → 5.\n\nSo total vertical is 5, horizontal was 3 → total is 3+5=8 lines.\n\nWait is this all? Let me verify.\n\nColumn 1: between row1-row2, 🐣🐣 → that's one line, then row3-row4, 🎋🎋 → another. So two vertical lines. So yes, column1 has 2.\n\nSo adding that all together, 3 horizontal +5 vertical? Wait no, vertical lines are column1:2, col2:1, col3:1, col4:1. So 2+1+1+1=5. Yes, so vertical is 5, horizontal 3, 3+5=8.\n\nWait, what about in vertical lines, column2? Let me double-check.\n\nColumn2: Row3: 🐣, row4: 🐣 → line of 2 → count 1. Column2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the total is 3 (horizontal) +5 (vertical) → 8 lines.\n\nBut wait, let me recount. Hmm, the rows contribute as follows:\n\nHorizontally:\n\nRow1: two lines (positions1-2 and 3-4).\n\nRow4: one line (positions2-4 → but wait, are they being counted as a single line of 3, so is it counted as 1, not as two lines of 2 and a line of 3?\n\nIn the row4: 🎋 🐣🐣🐣 → There's a run of three 🐣, which is one line. So row4 adds 1.\n\nSo in horizontal:\n\nRow1: 2 lines.\n\nRow2: 0.\n\nRow3: 0.\n\nRow4: 1.\n\nYes, that's 3.\n\nNow vertical:\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn1: 🐣 🐣 🎋 🎋 → two vertical runs: positions1-2 (🐣's) and 3-4(🎋🎋). So column1 contributes 2 lines.\n\nColumn2: 🐣, 🐏, 🐣, 🐣 → runs: 3-4 is 🐣🐣: 1 line.\n\nColumn3: 🐏, 🎋, 🎋, 🐣 → runs in 2-3.\n\nColumn4: 🐏, 🐏, etc.\n\nYes, that totals 2 in column1, 1 in column2, 1 in column3, 1 in column4 → 5.\n\nSo 3+5=8. So the answer is 8.\n\nWait, but looking back, did I miss any in horizontal or vertical? Let me review each row and column again.\n\nFor horizontal:\n\nRow1: has two separate runs of 2 each → 2\n\nRow2: no runs\n\nRow3: no runs\n\nRow4: one run of 3 → 1\n\nYes.\n\nFor columns:\n\nColumn1: two runs → 2\n\nColumn2: one run →1\n\nColumn3: one →1\n\nColumn4: one →1 → total 5.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the final answer is 8.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal and vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more on a 4x4 rectangular board.

{"board":[["🌍","🐚","🐤","🐤"],["🌍","🐤","🎁","🐤"],["🐚","🐤","🐤","🎁"],["🐤","🐤","🎁","🌍"]],"response":["<think>\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I count the number of horizontal or vertical lines of same emojis in a rectangular board. The lines should be two or longer. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the given board. The board is a 4x4 grid. The rows are as follows:\n\nRow 1: 🌍🐚🐤🐤\nRow 2: 🌍🐤🎁🐤\nRow 3: 🐚🐤🐤🎁\nRow 4: 🐤🐤🎁🌍\n\nI think I should check each row for horizontal lines and each column for vertical lines. For horizontal, I can go through each row and count sequences of same emojis that are 2 or more in length. Similarly, for vertical, I'll go through each column, checking each set of cells in the same column across all rows.\n\nLet me start with the horizontal lines.\n\nRow 1: 🌍, 🐚, 🐤, 🐤\nI see that the last two emojis are 🐤🐤. So that's a horizontal line of length 2. So that's 1.\n\nRow 2: 🌍, 🐤, 🎁, 🐤\nLooking here, each emoji is different from the next. So no horizontal lines here.\n\nRow 3: 🐚, 🐤, 🐤, 🎁\nHere, the middle two are 🐤🐤, so that's another horizontal line. So that's another 1.\n\nRow 4: 🐤, 🐤, 🎁, 🌍\nAgain, the first two are 🐤🐤. So that's another horizontal count. So horizontal total so far is 3.\n\nNow, let me check the vertical lines.\n\nThere are 4 columns, each column has 4 entries. Let's go column by column.\n\nColumn 1: 🌍, 🌍, 🐚, 🐤\nLooking down each cell:\nFirst cell is 🌍, then 🌍, 🐚, 🐤. Only the first two are same, which are 🌍🌍. They form a line of 2, so that's 1.\n\nColumn 2: 🐚, 🐤, 🐤, 🐤\nFirst is 🐚, then 🐤. So first and second are different. Second to third: 🐤🐤. Third to fourth also 🐤. So wait, the vertical column here from row 2 to row 4: 🐤🐤🐤. That's a vertical line of 3, which is acceptable. So that's another line, count increases by 1.\n\nWait, in column 2, the three consecutive 🐤s are rows 2,3,4. So from row 2, 3 in a column is more than 2. So that's one vertical line.\n\nColumn 3: 🐤, 🎁, 🐤, 🎁\nCheck each pair: row1 🐤 and row2 🎁 different; row2 🎁, row3 🐤 different; row3 🐤, row4 🎁 different. So no vertical lines in this column.\n\nColumn 4: 🐤, 🐤, 🎁, 🌍\nRow1: 🐤, row2: 🐤 → same, line of 2. So that's 1. Then row3 🎁 is different from row2 🐤. So that's another vertical line in column 4 of length 2.\n\nNow let's add the vertical counts: column1 contributes 1, column2 contributes 1, column4 contributes 1. So a total of 3 vertical lines.\n\nWait wait, let me recount columns because I think I might have missed something.\n\nColumn 1: row1 is 🌍, row2 is 🌍 → two same, count 1.\n\nColumn 2:\n- row1: 🐚; row2: 🐤 → different.\nWait, no. Column 2 has row1 as 🐚, row2 as 🐤, row3 as 🐤, row4 as 🐤.\n\nSo from row2 to row4, they are 🐤, 🐤, 🐤. That's 3 in a row, so one vertical line of length 3. So that contributes 1 line.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nRow1: 🐤, row2: 🐤 → that's two same, so count 1.\nBelow that, row3 is 🎁, so no continuation. So column4 adds 1.\n\nSo total vertical lines: 1 (col1) + 1 (col2) + 1 (col4) = 3.\n\nWait, any others? Let me see column3 again. No, because each row's entries are different.\n\nWait also, any longer sequences but maybe with multiple lines? Like, for example, column4 has two. But the count is per individual lines. Each continuous sequence is a line. So each column gets one line each for any such occurrence.\n\nSo vertical adds 3 lines.\n\nNow, horizontal lines total: 3 (from rows 1, 3, 4).\n\nAdding together, horizontal and vertical totals: 3 + 3 = 6? Wait, wait no, the total is just the sum of all lines found in both directions.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, horizontal: rows 1 has 1, row3 has 1, row4 has 1. So 3 lines.\n\nVertical: column1 has 1, column2 has 1, column4 has 1. So that's 3. 3 + 3 = 6.\n\nBut let me double-check all possible lines to make sure I didn't miss any.\n\nWait for horizontal lines:\n\nCheck each row again.\n\nRow1: [🌍, 🐚, 🐤, 🐤] → 🐤🐤 → 1 line.\n\nRow2: Checks all adjacent. All different except maybe if 3+ same, but no, so 0.\n\nRow3: [🐚, 🐤, 🐤, 🎁] → 🐤🐤 → 1 line.\n\nRow4: [🐤, 🐤, 🎁, 🌍] → 🐤🐤 → 1 line.\n\nSo that's 3 horizontal lines.\n\nVertical columns:\n\nColumn1: 🌍, 🌍, 🐚, 🐤 → 🌍🌍 → 1 line.\n\nColumn2: 🐚, 🐤, 🐤, 🐤 → 🐤🐤🐤 → 1 line of 3.\n\nColumn4: 🐤, 🐤, 🎁, 🌍 → 🐤🐤 → 1 line.\n\nWait, but what about column3:\n\nLooking again, maybe I missed something. Column3 is [🐤, 🎁, 🐤, 🎁]. So row1 is 🐤, row2 is 🎁, row3 is 🐤, row4 is 🎁: so no sequences of 2 or more same in any direction.\n\nSo that's 3 vertical lines.\n\nWait but in column4, the first two are 🐤🐤. It's a vertical line. So that's one, and that's all. So 3 vertical lines.\n\nSo total of 6 lines.\n\nWait, but wait a minute, are there any other lines? Let me think. What about maybe a longer line that's been counted but perhaps includes overlapping sections. Or perhaps I missed a longer line elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively maybe looking for the maximum possible in each direction.\n\nAnother approach: for each possible starting position, check right and check down for the maximum run of same emojis.\n\nBut perhaps for now, the count is 3 (horizontal) + 3 (vertical) = 6. So answer is 6.\n\nWait wait— no. Wait a second, I'm getting confused because some lines might be longer than 2. Like column2 has 3 same in a line. But each such line is counted as a single instance. So each continuous line in either direction, regardless of length, counts once if it is >=2.\n\nSo perhaps I can count each continuous run of 2 or more as one line each, regardless of how long it is, so whether it's length 2, 3, etc., it's just +1.\n\nSo in column2, the three 🐤s make one vertical line. Even though it's a line of 3, it counts as one.\n\nSo perhaps my initial count is correct: 3 horizontal lines and 3 vertical lines, making 6 in total.\n\nWait, but something feels off. Let me re-examine each row and column again.\n\nChecking horizontally:\n\nRow1: only 🐤🐤 → 1\nRow3: 🐤🐤 → 1\nRow4: 🐤🐤 → 1\nRow2: no → 0\nSo 3.\n\nVertically:\n\nColumn1: 🌍🌍 → 1\nColumn2: 🐤🐤🐤 → 1\nColumn4: 🐤🐤 →1\nOther columns: 0 →so 3.\nSo 3.\n\nHmm, that makes 6 in total. But wait, let's re-examine the board once more to make sure.\n\nLet's restate the board:\n\nRow 1: 🌍 🐚 🐤 🐤\nRow 2: 🌍 🐤 🎁 🐤\nRow 3: 🐚 🐤 🐤 🎁\nRow 4: 🐤 🐤 🎁 🌍\n\nLooking for horizontal lines beyond what I saw:\n\nRow 1: positions 3-4: same → count 1.\n\nRow 3: positions 2-3: same → count 1.\n\nRow 4: positions 1-2: same → count 1.\n\nSo that's 3. Now, columns:\n\nColumn1: rows 1-2: same → count 1.\n\nColumn2: rows 2-4: 🐤🐤🐤 → count 1.\n\nColumn4: rows 1-2: 🐤🐤 → count 1.\n\nSo total 3+3=6.\n\nWait, but let me check column 3 again for any possible lines.\n\nColumn3: positions:\nRow1: 🐤\nRow2: 🎁\nRow3: 🐤\nRow4: 🎁\n\nNo same consecutive, so 0.\n\nSo 6 lines in total?\n\nWait but earlier, I thought the vertical in column2 is one line, regardless of being 3 in length.\n\nIs that correct? Because the question is to count the number of lines formed, each being two or more in same direction.\n\nSo yeah, each run is counted once, no matter how long it is.\n\nSo 6 lines in total.\n\nWait, but let me see:\n\nAlternative approach: for each possible line of length ≥2, whether it's horizontal or vertical, how many are present.\n\nAlternative way: checking each cell, and expanding as much as possible to the right and down.\n\nBut perhaps that's overcomplicating now, but maybe a better approach for no missing lines.\n\nAgain, let me go row by row, and in each row, check for horizontal runs.\n\nFor each row, for each cell, look right and see if current and next cell are same. If so, count a line, and then skip the next cells to avoid overlapping counts. Or wait, each possible line is considered regardless of their starting point.\n\nWait, but perhaps for counting lines, any continuous sequence in a row or column counts as one line if it's length ≥2.\n\nBut for the purpose of this problem, a line like 🐤🐤🐤 would be one line, despite being longer than 2.\n\nSo, in the columns, in column in row2 to row4, 🐤🐤🐤 is a single vertical line.\n\nSimilarly, in the first two cells of row1 and row2, column4 is two in a row. So that's one line.\n\nOk.\n\nWait, perhaps I have to use a different approach. Let me list all possible lines.\n\nHorizontal lines:\n\nRow1: 🐤🐤 → 1.\n\nRow3: 🐤🐤 → 1.\n\nRow4: 🐤🐤 →1.\n\nThat's 3.\n\nVertical lines:\n\nColumn1: 🌍🌍 (rows1-2) →1.\n\nColumn2: 🐤🐤🐤 (rows2-4) →1.\n\nColumn4: 🐤🐤 (rows1-2) →1.\nWait, that's another.\n\nSo that's 3 vertical lines.\n\nSo sum is 6.\n\nWait, but in row3, the two 🐤s are a horizontal line.\n\nIs row3 correct?\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow3 is 🐚🐤🐤🎁 — yes, 2 🐤 in the middle. So that's 1.\n\nSo 3 in horizontal, 3 vertical.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me see if I might have missed any lines.\n\nWait, what about column2: rows2-3-4 are all 🐤🐤🐤, so that's one.\n\nColumn4, only the first two are 🐤, so one.\n\nSo yes, only three vertical.\n\nSo total of 6 lines.\n\nWait, but according to the initial statement:\n\nthe question says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\".\n\nSo lines can be of length 2 or more but each line is counted once regardless of how long it is.\n\nIn the problem statement, yes, each line is counted once if it's length ≥2.\n\nTherefore, the total count is 6.\n\nSo the Answer is 6.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more, on a given 4x4 board.

Each line has to be two or longer, and it's formed by the same emoji. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nThe board is a 4x4 grid. I should probably look at each row and column to check for consecutive emojis. Let's start by writing down the board lines clearly to visualize it better.\n\nThe board is given as:\n1. 🐋🐗🐎🐎\n2. 🐗🐗🐋🐸\n3. 🐎🐎🐎🐋\n4. 🐋🐸🐸🐸\n\nAlright, let me process each row first for horizontal lines.\n\nRow 1: 🐋, 🐗, 🐎, 🐎\nLooking for consecutive same emojis. So positions 3 and 4 are 🐎🐎. That's a line of length 2. So one line here.\n\nRow 2: 🐗, 🐗, 🐋, 🐸\nPositions 1 and 2 are 🐗🐗. Another line of length 2. So that's one.\n\nRow 3: 🐎, 🐎, 🐎, 🐋\nHere, positions 1,2,3 are 🐎 three times. That's a line of 3. So that's one line.\n\nRow 4: 🐋, 🐸, 🐸, 🐸\nPositions 2,3,4 are 🐸 three times. So that's another line.\n\nSo let's count horizontal lines: 1 (row1) +1 (row2) +1 (row3) +1 (row4) = 4.\n\nNow, checking the vertical lines, which means looking at each column and seeing consecutive same emojis down the rows.\n\nColumn 1: 🐋, 🐗, 🐎, 🐋\nCheck row 1: 🐋, then next row is 🐗—different. So no lines here.\n\nColumn 2: 🐗, 🐗, 🐎, 🐸\nRow1: 🐗. Row2: 🐗. So position (2,1) and (2,2) same. So that's a vertical line of length 2. So one line.\n\nThen row3: 🐎, different. So only this pair contributes. So one line.\n\nColumn3: 🐎, 🐋, 🐎, 🐸\nCheck each row:\n- row1: 🐎, row2: 🐋—different.\n- row2: 🐋, row3: 🐎—different.\n- row3: 🐎, row4: 🐸—different.\nNo consecutive lines here, vertical.\n\nColumn4: 🐎, 🐸, 🐋, 🐸\nRow1: 🐎, row2: 🐸—different.\nRow2: 🐸, row3: 🐋—different.\nRow3: 🐋, row4: 🐸—different.\nNo lines here.\n\nSo vertical lines: only column2 contributes one line.\n\nWait, but are there any longer lines that I might have missed? For column 2, it's two in a row. That's one line. So total vertical lines: 1.\n\nNow, adding horizontal and vertical lines, total is 4 +1=5?\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me go through each column again in case I missed a longer line.\n\nWait, perhaps column 3 or 4 could have something. Column 3: entries row1 to 4 are 🐎,🐋,🐎,🐸. No same next elements. Column4: 🐎,🐸,🐋,🐸. No consecutive same, except maybe row4, but row4 is 🐋 (row3) and 🐸 (row4). Different.\n\nSo vertical lines: only one.\n\nWait, but looking again, column 2 has row1 to row4 as 🐗, 🐗, 🐎, 🐸—so only the first two rows are same. So that's a vertical line of length 2. No longer.\n\nSo total vertical lines:1.\n\nAnd horizontal lines:4.\n\nSo total should be 5.\n\nWait, but row3 has three consecutive, which counts as once, but perhaps in some cases longer lines could count as containing multiple but in this problem, each line that has two or more consecutive is counted once, regardless of how long it is beyond two.\n\nSo for example, a span of three same emojis in a horizontal row is just one line, not considering that it could have two separate lines of two (the first two and the next two overlapping). I think each contiguous block counts as one line, regardless of length (as long as >=2). So our count seems correct.\n\nSo adding them, 4 (horizontal) +1 (vertical) =5.\n\nWait, but wait—am I forgetting something? Let me check each column again. Did I miss any possible lines?\n\nWait, what about columns where you have three same in a row, or four.\n\nLooking again.\n\nColumn2: row1 and row2 are same, row3 and row2 different. So that's a line of length 2, done.\n\nColumn3: No two same in a vertical line.\n\nAnother thing: in the board, check each cell for possible vertical lines longer than two, but in the given case, the only vertical is in column2: two consecutive.\n\nSo vertical total 1.\n\nSo the total is 4+1 =5.\n\nWait, but wait... let me check once more.\n\nAnother approach: for every possible line of 2 or more, regardless of direction.\n\nHorizontal:\n\nRow1: 🐎🐎: length 2 → 1\nRow2: 🐗🐗: length 2 →1\nRow3: 🐎🐎🐎: length3 →1\nRow4: 🐸🐸🐸: length3 →1\nSo horizontal lines: 4.\n\nVertical:\n\nLooking column by column.\n\nEach possible run of 2 or more consecutive same emojis.\n\nColumn1:\nRow1: 🐋; row2: 🐗 (different) → no run longer than 1.\nNo lines.\n\nColumn2:\nRow1 and row2: both 🐗. So vertical run of 2 →1 line.\n\nBut what about row2 and row3: no, but as above, row2 is 🐗 and row3 column2 is 🐎. So only row1-2 contributes.\n\nSo vertical lines:1.\n\nTotal lines:4+1=5.\n\nSo I'm pretty confident the answer is 5.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji on a 4x4 board.

{"board":[["🌳","🥀","🌳","🌳"],["🐛","🐛","🦍","🥀"],["🐛","🌳","🌳","🌳"],["🐛","🥀","🥀","🥀"]],"response":["<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to count all the horizontal and vertical lines on a board made of emojis. Each line should be formed by the same emoji and be at least 2 in length. Hmm, where do I start?\n\nFirst, let me visualize the board as given. It seems to be a 4x4 grid based on the data provided. Each row is a string of emojis. Let me write them down row by row.\n\nRow 1: 🌳 🥀 🌳 🌳\nRow 2: 🐛 🐛 🦍 🥀\nRow 3: 🐛 🌳 🌳 🌳\nRow 4: 🐛 🥀 🥀 🥀\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me recount. Each line represents a row. So, the board has 4 rows, each with 4 elements. Let me structure it correctly.\n\nRow 0: 🌳, 🥀, 🌳, 🌳\nRow 1: 🐛, 🐛, 🦍, 🥀\nRow 2: 🐛, 🌳, 🌳, 🌳\nRow 3: 🐛, 🥀, 🥀, 🥀\n\nNow, I need to count all consecutive same emojis, both horizontally and vertically, of length 2 or more.\n\nSo first, I'll check horizontally in each row. Then, I'll check vertically in each column.\n\nLet's start with horizontal lines.\n\nRow 0: 🌳, 🥀, 🌳 🌳\nLooking for consecutive repeats.\n\n- The first two are 🌳 and 🥀: not same, so no line.\n- Next, 🥀 and 🌳: different.\n- Then, 🌳 and 🌳: same. But wait, the row is of length 4, so indices 0: 🌳, 1: 🥀, 2: 🌳, 3: 🌳. So the two 🌳s are in positions 2 and 3. So that's a horizontal line of length 2, count as 1.\n\nBut wait, could there be longer lines? If there's a longer run, how does it count. Like a line of 3 same emojis would contribute: for a run of 3, the count is how many lines it contains. For example, three in a row would be segments of length 2 and 3: but does the problem count each possible line of length 2 or more or the maximal lines?\n\nWait, the problem says, \"lines formed by the same emoji, length of 2 or more.\" So each contiguous group of same emojis forms one line for each possible length, but I think it's about maximal lines. No, wait, the question says a line is formed by same emojis connected consecutively. So for example, a run of 3 same in horizontal would be considered as two lines: one of length 3 and two of length 2. Wait, I'm a bit confused about what's the correct approach.\n\nWait, the question says to count each line with length ≥2. So each occurrence of 2,3,4 consecutive same emojis counts as 1, 2, 3 lines respectively? Or does each maximal group count as one line, regardless of how long it is beyond 2?\n\nWait, the problem says 'count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.' So perhaps each contiguous run that is two or longer counts as one line. So even if you have three same emojis, it's just one line of length 3, not two of length 2 plus another. So for example, in a run of 4 same emojis, that's a single line of length 4, which counts as 1 towards the total.\n\nWait, or is it that each possible pair in a longer run? No, no, because when I read the problem statement again, it says 'lines.' So a line is a consecutive group. So for four same emojis in a row, that's one horizontal line of length 4, which contributes 1 to the count.\n\nHmm, then for each row, I'll scan for any runs of 2 or more, and count each such run once.\n\nWait, but the example given wasn't provided, so perhaps I should proceed with this logic.\n\nSo, let's process each row:\n\nRow 0: 🌳, 🥀, 🌳, 🌳\n\nWe look for consecutive same emojis. Let's walk through each position and track runs.\n\n- Position 0: 🌳\n- Position 1: 🥀 (different from previous)\n- Position 2: 🌳 (different from previous, start new)\n- Position 3: 🌳 same as previous. So positions 2 and 3: a run of 2, count 1.\n\nTotal for Row 0: 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow 1: 🐛, 🐛, 🦍, 🥀\n\n- Positions 0 and 1: 🐛 same. So run of 2: count 1.\n- Position 2 and 3: 🦍 and 🥀, both different, so no runs.\n\nRow 1: 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow 2: 🐛, 🌳, 🌳, 🌳\n\n- Position 1: 🌳, position 0: 🐛: no\n- Position 2: 🌳 same as previous (position 1)\n- Position 3: 🌳 same as previous (position 2)\nSo run from position 1 to 3 (length 3), count 1.\n\nRow 2: 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow 3: 🐛, 🥀, 🥀, 🥀\n\n- Positions 1,2,3: 🥀 same.\nSo run from position 1 to 3 (length 3), count 1.\n\nSo for horizontal lines, total is 1+1+1+1 =4? Wait wait, let me recount.\n\nWait, looking at each row:\n\nRow 0: only positions 2-3 as 2, so 1 line.\n\nRow1: positions0-1, 2 line? Wait, Row1 was checked as having a run of length 2: yes. So another 1.\n\nRow2: positions1,2,3: so run length 3, counts as 1.\n\nRow3: run from position1-3: run length 3, counts as 1.\n\nSo total horizontal lines: 1 +1 +1 +1 =4.\n\nNow for vertical lines: check each column for consecutive same emojis.\n\nThe board has 4 rows and 4 columns.\n\nLet's go column by column.\n\nColumn0:\n\nRow0: 🌳\nRow1: 🐛\nRow2: 🐛\nRow3: 🐛\n\nLooking up each row:\n\nRow0: 🌳\nRow1: 🐛 (different from row0)\nRow2: 🐛 (same as row1: so row1 and 2: consecutive same, but also row 2-3?\nRow3: 🐛 (same as row2.\n\nSo in column0:\n\nRow1,2,3: 🐛 same. So positions row1,2,3: consecutive same. The run is three in a column, so counts as1.\n\nAlso, row2 and3: same, but I think it's the same run.\n\nColumn0 vertical lines: 1.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow0: 🥀\nRow1: 🐛\nRow2: 🌳\nRow3: 🥀\n\nCheck each row's cell with the one above.\n\nRow0: 🥀, row1: 🐛: different. No run.\n\nRow1: 🐛, row2: 🌳: different.\n\nRow2: 🌳, row3: 🥀: different.\n\nNo vertical runs of 2+; so column1 contributes zero.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: 🌳\nRow1: 🦍\nRow2: 🌳\nRow3: 🥀\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\nRow0: 🌳, row1: 🦍 (different)\nRow1: 🦍, row2: 🌳 (different)\nRow2: 🌳, row3: 🥀 (different)\nSo no runs. So column2 contributes 0.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🌳\nRow1: 🥀\nRow2: 🌳\nRow3: 🥀\n\nCheck:\n\nRow0: 🌳, row1: 🥀: different\nRow1: 🥀, row2: 🌳: different\nRow2: 🌳, row3: 🥀: different. So no vertical runs.\n\nSo column3 contributes 0.\n\nSo total vertical lines are 1 (from column0's rows1-2-3).\n\nWait wait, earlier I thought column0's run is length3 (rows1,2,3). So it's a vertical line of length3: counts as 1.\n\nAdditionally, do any shorter runs exist? For example, rows1-2 and 2-3 within that same column. But since it's a continuous run of 3, we only count it once.\n\nNo other runs: columns 1,2,3 have nothing. So vertical lines: 1.\n\nWait, or perhaps are there consecutive runs of 2 anywhere else?\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some.\n\nLet me recheck each column.\n\nColumn0:\n\nRow1,2,3: three same. So vertical line of 3.\n\nRow2 and3: same as row1-2 and row1-2-3.\n\nSince it's a single run, it's one line.\n\nColumn0 total:1.\n\nSo overall:\n\nHorizontal lines:4.\n\nVertical lines:1.\n\nTotal:5 lines.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the columns again because I might have missed something.\n\nColumns again:\n\nColumn0:\n\nRow0: 🌳 different from row1.\n\nRow1: 🐛, row2: 🐛: same. So row1-2 is a run of two. Then row3 is also 🐛, so it's row1-3, a run of three.\n\nSo one vertical line.\n\nColumn0:1.\n\nColumn1:\n\n🥀,🐛,🌳,🥀. No two same consecutively.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow3 is 🥀? Wait no, Row3 is column3; perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait column2:\n\nRow0: 🌳\nRow1: 🦍\nRow2: 🌳\nRow3: 🥀–?\n\nWait, no, actually, wait let me correctly visualize each cell.\n\nLet's reorganize the board as a 4x4 grid, row 0 to 3, each with 4 elements. (Assuming that the first line is row0, and the first item is column0.)\n\nRow0: [🌳, 🥀, 🌳, 🌳]\n\nRow1: [🐛, 🐛, 🦍, 🥀]\n\nRow2: [🐛, 🌳, 🌳, 🌳]\n\nRow3: [🐛, 🥀, 🥀, 🥀]\n\nSo columns are accessing each element down the rows.\n\nSo column0 is: 🌳, 🐛, 🐛, 🐛 → rows 0 to 3.\n\nYes, that's what I thought earlier. So rows 1,2,3: 🐛, so vertical run of 3.\n\nColumn0:1.\n\nColumn1:\n\n🥀 (row0), 🐛 (row1), 🌳 (row2), 🥀 (row3). So:\n\nRow0 to1: different.\n\nRow1: 🐛; row2: 🌳: different.\n\nRow2: 🌳; row3: 🥀: different. So no runs.\n\nColumn1: 0.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: 🌳\n\nRow1: 🦍\n\nRow2: 🌳\n\nRow3: 🥀\n\nSo:\n\nRow0 and1: different.\n\nRow1 and2: different.\n\nRow2 and3: different. No runs.\n\nSo column2: 0.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🌳\n\nRow1: 🥀\n\nRow2: 🌳\n\nRow3: 🥀\n\nCheck each adjacent:\n\nRow0→1: different.\n\nRow1→2: different.\n\nRow2→3: different. So no runs.\n\nThus, vertical lines:1.\n\nHorizontals:4. So total of 5 lines.\n\nWait, but wait again. Maybe I'm miscounting. Let me think about each column again.\n\nFor column0: rows0 is 🌳, which is different from row1. So the vertical run starts at row1 and goes through row3.\n\nTherefore, in column0, the run is from row1 to3 (length3). So one vertical line.\n\nAnother column: possible other vertical runs?\n\nSay, in column1:\n\nNope, because all are different.\n\nHow about row3, column3: three in a row vertical? No, because column3's row3 is 🥀, but above that, row2 is 🌳. So for column positions in row3, only horizontal runs, not vertical.\n\nSo back to overall counts:\n\nHorizontal:4.\n\nVertical:1.\n\nTotal:5.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in Row2, the run is three that counts as one, and so on.\n\nWait, another thought: when checking horizontal lines, for row2, the emojis are 🐛, 🌳, 🌳, 🌳.\n\nThat's a run starting at index1 to 3: length3. So counts as 1.\n\nSimilarly, row3: 🐛, followed by three 🥀: so run starts at index1 to 3: length3. That's 1.\n\nWait, row1: 🐛, 🐛, so run of 2.\n\nRow0: a run of 2 at the end.\n\nSo total horizontal lines: 4.\n\nPlus vertical:1. So total is 5.\n\nI think this is correct.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal and vertical lines on a 4x4 board made up of emojis. Each line must be formed by the same emoji and have a length of 2 or more.

The lines should be two or more in length and made of the same emoji. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll walk through my thought process carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll try to visualize the board. It's a 4x4 grid since each row has four emojis. Let me write down each row for clarity:\n\nRow 1: ⛅️ 🐠 🦉 🏄\nRow 2: 🦉 🐠 🏄 🦉\nRow 3: 🏄 🐠 ⛅️ 🦉\nRow 4: 🦉 🏄 🏄 ⛅️\n\nSo now, I need to check each possible horizontal and vertical line. I should start by checking each row for horizontal lines and each column for vertical lines.\n\nStarting with horizontal lines:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: ⛅️ 🐠 🦉 🏄 – All different, so no lines here.\n\nRow 2: 🦉 🐠 🏄 🦉 – First and last are 🦉, but the ones in between are different. So the line starts at the first but only ends at the last, but the middle is different. So I don't see any consecutive same emojis in a row longer than two, except maybe the first and last? No, because they're not consecutive in position. So no line here.\n\nRow 3: 🏄 🐠 ⛅️ 🦉 – Again, all different. So nothing.\n\nRow 4: 🦉 🏄 🏄 ⛅️ – Wait, here I see 🏄 🏄, so that's a horizontal line of length 2. So that counts as one.\n\nSo for horizontal lines, I have 1 so far.\n\nNow vertical lines: I'll check each column.\n\nColumn 1:\n⛅️ \n🦉 \n🏄 \n🦉 \nSo, each is different. So no lines here.\n\nColumn 2:\n🐠\n🐠\n🐠\n🏄\nSo positions 1 to 3 in this column are 🐠. So that's a vertical line of length 3. That's one.\n\nColumn 3:\n🦉\n🏄\n⛅️\n🏄\nSo, first is 🦉, then 🏄, which is same as last in column 4? Wait, the last in column 4 is ⛅️. Hmm. So column 3 has all different except maybe the third row? No, third row is ⛅️, then in fourth row of column 3, is 🏄, which is different. So no vertical lines in column 3.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nColumn 3:\nRow1: 🦉\nRow2: 🏄\nRow3: ⛅️\nRow4: 🏄\n\nSo, only rows 2 and 4 have 🏄, but they are not consecutive. So no line.\n\nColumn 4:\n🏄\n🦉\n🦉\n⛅️\nLooking for consecutive:\n\nBetween row2 (🦉) and row3 (🦉), that's a vertical line of length 2. So that's another one.\n\nWait, does that count? Let's see. Row2 and row3 have the same emoji 🦉 in column4. So that's 2 in a line. So yes, that's another line.\n\nSo column2: line of length3 → 1.\nColumn4: line of length2 →1.\n\nSo vertical lines give me 2.\n\nSo total lines so far: 1 (horizontal) + 2 (vertical) = 3.\n\nWait, am I missing any other lines? Let me double-check.\n\nWait what about other columns? Like, maybe another vertical line elsewhere.\n\nLet's see:\n\nColumn 1 again:\nIt's ⛅️, 🦉, 🏄, 🦉. So nothing.\n\nColumn2: I think I accounted for the three 🐠s, which is a line of 3.\n\nColumn3: discussed, no lines.\n\nColumn4: 🏄, 🦉, 🦉, ⛅️. So the two 🦉 are consecutive, yes.\n\nWait, what about horizontal lines: I think I only found one in row4.\n\nHmm. Let me make sure I didn't miss any horizontal lines.\n\nRow4: 🦉 🏄 🏄 ⛅️. The two 🏄 in positions 2 and 3 make a line of length 2.\n\nAre there any others?\n\nRow2: reading left to right: 🦉, 🐠, 🏄, 🦉. So no two consecutive except perhaps 🦉 at ends, but not consecutive.\n\nRow3: nothing, as before.\n\nSo horizontal lines: 1.\n\nSo total is 3. Wait, maybe I'm missing something? Let me look again more carefully.\n\nWait, how about vertical lines in column2. It's 🐠 in all three top rows (rows1, 2,3). So from row1 to row3, that's three in a line vertically. Do they count as a single line of 3, or multiple lines? Let's re-read the question.\n\nThe problem says, 'lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.'\n\nSo a line can be two or more. So in column2, the 🐠s are in rows1,2,3, lengths 3. So that forms one line of length3, but does it also include lines of length2.\n\nWait, the way the problem is phrased, it's looking for any line that is two or more in length. For example, in a vertical case:\n\nif in a column I have four same emojis, then how many lines are there? It would have lines of lengths 2,3,4. Or perhaps the question counts each maximal possible line once.\n\nHmm, the problem describes that 'horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, ...' so each maximal run. So, in the case of 3 consecutive, it's a single line of 3, not multiple lines of 2 and 3. So in column2, three 🐠s are one line. So that's correct.\n\nSo, the total vertical lines are two (column2 with 3, column4 with 2).\n\nWait, no. Wait, column4 has two in a line, so that's one line. Column2 has three in a line, that's another line. So the vertical lines are column2 (length3, counts as 1) and column4 (length2, counts as 1) → 2.\n\nSo total lines are horizontal (1) + vertical (2) =3? Or am I missing something?\n\nWait another possibility: Looking at vertical lines again, maybe in column3 or column1, do any have two in a line?\n\nColumn3 has in row2: 🏄, and row4: 🏄. But they're not consecutive, so no line. So no.\n\nSo only two vertical lines and one horizontal.\n\nWait another step: in horizontal, I need to check each row for more than just one line?\n\nWait, for example, maybe a row has two separate lines of two, but I don't think that's possible because it's four columns, but if a row was the same emoji in positions such that there's a split, like AABA in a row, then you have two AA lines, but I don't think any row in the current setup has that.\n\nLooking back at the rows:\n\nRow1: All different.\n\nRow2: 🦉 🐠 🏄 🦉. The first and last are same, but not consecutive. The only possible line here would be if 🦉 🦉, but they are separated by two in between, so no line.\n\nRow3: All different except maybe some, but no runs of two.\n\nRow4: 🦉 🏄 🏄 ⛅️ → so two 🏄 in a row. That's covered.\n\nSo that's one line.\n\nSo my total is 3 lines: 2 vertical, 1 horizontal. But wait, maybe I'm forgetting a vertical line somewhere else.\n\nWait, another look: column1 has 🦉 in row2 and row4. So two separated by one row, so no.\n\nNow, double-checking column4:\n\nRow2 is 🦉, row3 is 🦉: that's two consecutive, so one line.\n\nWhat about column2: rows 1,2,3 🐠, which is 3 in a line, which counts as one line.\n\nSo vertical lines: columns2 and4,  two lines.\n\nHorizontal lines: row4 has one line.\n\nSo total 3 lines.\n\nBut wait, another thought: Did I miss any lines in the problem statement? The question includes both horizontal and vertical.\n\nSo my answer would be 3.\n\nBut let me check once more.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps I should check for lines in all possible positions, considering both horizontal and vertical.\n\nLet's list where runs occur:\n\nHorizontal runs:\n\n- Row 4: positions 2 and 3: 🏄 🏄 → length 2 → 1 line.\n\nVertical runs:\n\n- Column 2: positions1,2,3: 🐠 🐠 🐠 → length3 → 1 line.\n\n- Column4: positions2 and3: 🦉 🦉 → length2 →1 line.\n\nSo total 3 lines.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake. Because in column4, row4 is ⛅️. So the run is only row2 and 3 as 🦉, meaning two consecutive. So that counts as one line.\n\nSo, 1 horizontal, two vertical lines.\n\nHence, total 3 lines.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more in a 4x4 grid.

{"board":[["😆","☄️","☄️","😆"],["🐯","🐯","😆","☄️"],["🦏","🐯","☄️","🦏"],["🦏","🦏","☄️","☄️"]],"response":["<think>\nOkay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines on a board made up of emojis. Each line has to be two or longer. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably look at the board as a grid. Let me write it out so I can visualize it better.\n\nThe board is given as four rows, each with four emojis. Let me list them out row by row.\n\nRow 0: 😆 ☄️ ☄️ 😆\nRow 1: 🐯 🐯 😆 ☄️\nRow 2: 🦏 🐯 ☄️ 🦏\nRow 3: 🦏 🦏 ☄️ ☄️\n\nWait, maybe numbering the rows as 0 to 3 and columns as 0 to 3 would help too. So each position can be identified as (row, column).\n\nSo the grid looks like this:\n\nRow 0:\n0: 😆\n1: ☄️\n2: ☄️\n3: 😆\n\nRow 1:\n0: 🐯\n1: 🐯\n2: 😆\n3: ☄️\n\nRow 2:\n0: 🦏\n1: 🐯\n2: ☄️\n3: 🦏\n\nRow 3:\n0: 🦏\n1: 🦏\n2: ☄️\n3: ☄️\n\nOkay, now I need to check both horizontal and vertical lines of the same emoji. Each line must be at least two in length.\n\nLet me tackle horizontal lines first. For each row, I'll check sequences of same emojis.\n\nStarting with Row 0:\n\nPositions 0-3: 😆, ☄️, ☄️, 😆. So here, positions 1 and 2 are both ☄️, which is a line of length 2. So that's one horizontal line.\n\nRow 1:\n\nPositions 0 and 1 are both 🐯, another horizontal line. Also, any other consecutive? Position 2 is 😆, position 3 is ☄️. So only one line in this row.\n\nRow 2:\n\nLooking at each column, position 0 is 🦏, 1 is 🐯, 2 is ☄️, 3 is 🦏. So no two consecutive same emojis in horizontal. So no lines here.\n\nRow 3:\n\nPositions 0 and 1 are both 🦏, that's a line. Then, positions 2 and 3 are both ☄️, another line. So row 3 gives us two horizontal lines.\n\nSo total horizontal lines are 1 (row 0) + 1 (row1) + 2 (row3) = 4.\n\nWait, wait wait—no, wait: Let me recount. Because sometimes longer sequences can produce multiple lines. But in this case, each row's lines are consecutive sequences. So the count is the number of such sequences in each row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should process each row and for each possible starting position, check the maximum run length. But for the sake of this problem, perhaps just checking how many horizontal runs of length ≥2 are present.\n\nWait, for example, a run of three same emojis would count as two lines: a line of two, and then another starting at the second position for another line of two. But wait, the way the problem is phrased, are we counting each possible line of two or more? Or are we counting runs as single lines if longer than two?\n\nHmm. Wait the original problem statement says: 'the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.' So perhaps each such maximal sequence counts as one line per contiguous in a single row or column.\n\nLike, for example, if a row has three same emojis in a row, that's considered one line that's three emojis long. Wait, but how does that affect the count? Because a line of three could be considered as including two sublines of length two—but perhaps the problem counts each maximal run once.\n\nWait, but looking back, the problem says \"formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So for a row like A A A, is that one line of length 3, or three separate lines (but overlapping, but each starting at different positions? )\n\nBut wait, no. Because when you have a run of 3 same emojis, it's one single continuous line. So for example, a run of 3 would give us two separate lines of length 2? Or is it just considered as one longer line?\n\nThe problem's wording isn't entirely clear, but I think it's more likely that each continuous sequence longer than 2 counts as one line. Or perhaps each continuous run counts as one line if it's two or longer, regardless of whether it's part of a longer run. Hmm.\n\nWait maybe each maximal line (run that can't be extended in either direction) counts as one entry, and its length has to be ≥2. So for example, in a row ABC, where BB are two B's, that's one line. If you have BBB, that's a line of three, which counts as one line.\n\nOK, so for each row, we look for all maximal horizontal runs of same emojis, and if they're two or longer, we count one per run.\n\nSo going back to the rows:\n\nRow 0: Emoji sequence: 😆, ☄️, ☄️, 😆.\n\nSo in horizontal direction:\n\n- The first emoji is single, so nothing. Then the next two (☄️, ☄️) are a run of 2—so count as 1 line. The last is single. So row 0 contributes 1.\n\nRow1: 🐯 🐯😆 ☄️\n\nHere, the first two are 🐯🐯: run of 2 → count 1. The rest are single, so row1 contributes 1.\n\nRow2: 🦏 🐯 ☄️ 🦏 → all single, so no lines.\n\nRow3: 🦏 🦏 ☄️ ☄️. So first two are 🦏: run of 2, and last two are ☄️: run of 2. So each is a separate run. So row3 contributes 2.\n\nSo horizontal lines total 1+1+0+2=4.\n\nNow, let's check vertical lines.\n\nVertical lines: For each column, check top to bottom for same emojis.\n\nWe have four columns, each with four elements.\n\nFirst, column 0:\n\nRow0: 😆\n\nRow1: 🐯\n\nRow2: 🦏\n\nRow3: 🦏\n\nSo the emojis are 😆, 🐯, 🦏, 🦏. So only the last two are the same (🦏, 🦏)—so that's a run of 2. So column 0 contributes 1.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow0: ☄️\n\nRow1: 🐯\n\nRow2: 🐯\n\nRow3: 🦏\n\nSo row0: ☄️, row1: 🐯, row2: 🐯, row3: 🦏.\n\nSo checking vertically: rows 1 and 2 are both 🐯, which is a run of 2 → count 1. Row3 has 🦏, which doesn't match the above. So column1 contributes 1.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: ☄️\n\nRow1: 😆\n\nRow2: ☄️ → Wait, let me recount:\n\nWait column2:\n\nRow0: ☄️. Row1: 😆. Row2: ☄️. Row3: ☄️.\n\nWait:\n\nRow0: col2 → position (0,2) → ☄️.\n\nRow1: col2 → (1,2) → 😆.\n\nRow2: position (2,2) → ☄️.\n\nRow3: position (3,2) → ☄️.\n\nSo rows 0: ☄️ → row1: 😆. Not same.\n\nThen row2 and row3 are both ☄️ (position 2 and 3) → so a run of 2 → count as 1 line. So column2 contributes 1.\n\nColumn3:\n\nrow0: 😆\n\nrow1: ☄️\n\nrow2: 🦏\n\nrow3: ☄️\n\nSo check top to bottom. So row0: 😆, row1: ☄️ → not same.\n\nThen row2: 🦏 and row3: ☄️, no.\n\nLooking for vertical runs in column3:\n\nPositions: 😆, ☄️, 🦏, ☄️.\n\nNo consecutive same, except perhaps none. So column3 has no vertical lines.\n\nWait, wait. What about rows 0 and 1: no. Between rows 2 and 3: 🦏 and ☄️, not same. So column3 contributes nothing.\n\nSo vertical lines: column0:1, column1:1, column2:1, column3:0 → total 3.\n\nSo adding horizontal and vertical lines: 4 (horizontal) + 3 (vertical) = 7.\n\nWait, wait—did I miss any lines in vertical?\n\nWait, let me double-check each column.\n\nColumn0:\n\nrow0: 😆\n\nrow1: 🐯\n\nrow2: 🦏\n\nrow3: 🦏 → rows 2 and 3 together: 🦏,🦏 → run of 2. So yes, 1.\n\nColumn1:\n\nrow0: ☄️\n\nrow1: 🐯\n\nrow2: 🐯 → row1 and row2: same → run of 2. So 1.\n\nColumn2:\n\nrow3 and row2: both ☄️? Wait row0 is ☄️, row2 is ☄️ (position [0][2] = ☄️, [2][2]=☄️. What about in between?\n\nWait, no. Column2 in row0, it's ☄️. Row1 has 😆, row2 has ☄️, row3 has ☄️.\n\nSo in column2, row2 and row3 are both ☄️, making a run of 2. Correct.\n\nSo total vertical lines are 3.\n\nSo 4+3 is 7.\n\nWait, wait, is that the final answer then? Or am I missing something?\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe there are longer vertical runs. For example, a run of 3 would count as a single line or contribute multiple.\n\nNo, because we are considering each maximal run. So each run counts once, no matter how long, as long as it's ≥2.\n\nSo another example: if a column has four same emojis, that's a single run → counts as 1.\n\nSo in our case, all vertical runs are of length 2, so each should count as one each.\n\nOK, let me double-check the vertical columns again.\n\nColumn0: [:-)] ] , 🐯, 🦏, 🦏.\n\nRows 2 and 3 have 🦏, so that's a run. That's it.\n\nYes.\n\nColumn1: [ ) 🐯, 🐯, ].\n\nRows 1 and 2 are 🐯, 🐯.\n\nSo yes, one line.\n\nColumn2: row3 is ☄️; row2 is ☄️. So those two are a run.\n\nColumn3: no runs.\n\nSo vertical lines total 3.\n\nSo horizontal 4, vertical 3 → total 7.\n\nThus, the answer is 7.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines on a 4x4 emoji board, where a line is defined as a sequence of the same emoji with a length of 2 or more.

Hmm, let's think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the board. Let's write it down as a 4-row by 4-column grid.\n\nRow 1: 💫 💫 💫 🦩\nRow 2: 💫 🐜 🦩 🦕\nRow 3: 🦕 🦩 🦩 💫\nRow 4: 🦕 🦕 🐜 🦕\n\nWait, no. Wait—Row 3 starts with 🦕, then two 🦩, and ends with 💫. Row 4 is 🦕 🦕 🐜 🦕.\n\nI think it's better to represent this as rows with indexes 0 to 3, each containing 4 emojis.\n\nSo:\n\nRow 0: [0] 💫, [1] 💫, [2] 💫, [3] 🦩\n\nRow 1: [0] 💫, [1] 🐜, [2] 🦩, [3] 🦕\n\nRow 2: [0] 🦕, [1] 🦩, [2] 🦩, [3] 💫\n\nRow 3: [0] 🦕, [1] 🦕, [2] 🐜, [3] 🦕\n\nWait, no—for row 3, the last element is 🦕? Let me confirm:\n\nThe given board is:\n\n💫💫💫🦩\n💫🐜🦩🦕\n🦕🦩🦩💫\n🦕🦕🐜🦕\n\nSo yes, row 3 is [🦕, 🦕, 🐜, 🦕].\n\nSo, now I need to check each row for horizontal lines (same emoji consecutively) and each column for vertical lines.\n\nEach line can be of length 2,3,4. Each such occurrence counts as 1 line.\n\nWait, no—each contiguous sequence of same emojis in a row or column, and each such sequence that is 2 or longer counts as one. So a sequence of 3 should count once, not twice or something.\n\nBut wait the problem says: 'lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.' So each such line is a group of same emojis in a straight line, either horizontal or vertical, and each such continuous group of 2+ counts as one line.\n\nSo, for each row, I'll scan for runs of same emojis, then for each run, if it's length >=2, increment the count. Similarly, for columns, same approach.\n\nSo, let's start with horizontal lines.\n\nRow 0: 💫, 💫, 💫, 🦩.\n\nSo the first three are 💫, forming a run of 3. Since it's length >=2, it's a count of 1.\n\nThen, the fourth element is 🦩, which is a run of 1. So total for row 0 is 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow 1: 💫, 🐜, 🦩, 🦕.\n\nEach emoji is unique; all runs are of length 1. So no horizontal lines here.\n\nRow 2: 🦕, 🦩, 🦩, 💫.\n\nThe first emoji is 🦕, run of 1. Then, positions 1 and 2 are 🦩—a run of 2. So this counts as 1. So row 2 contributes 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow 3: 🦕, 🦕, 🐜, 🦕.\n\nPositions 0 and 1 are 🦕🦕—a run of 2. So that contributes 1. The third is 🐜, run of 1, and then fourth is 🦕 which is a run of 1, adjacent to the previous in the row? No, because position 3 is 🦕, which is same as position 0 and 1? Wait, no, position 3 comes after position 2 which is 🐜, so it's a separate run. So only one horizontal line in row 3.\n\nSo for horizontal lines, the count is 1 (row0) + 1 (row2) + 1 (row3) = 3.\n\nNow, vertical lines: checking each column for runs of same emojis.\n\nEach column has 4 elements.\n\nColumn 0: [💫, 💫, 🦕, 🦕]\n\nWait, let's list each column:\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow 0: 💫\n\nRow1: 💫\n\nRow2: 🦕\n\nRow3: 🦕\n\nWait, that's correct. So column0 has elements [💫, 💫, 🦕, 🦕].\n\nSo examine runs in column0:\n\nStart with top element: indices 0 (💫) and 1 (💫) same. So a run of 2: counts as 1.\n\nThen index 2 (🦕) and 3 (🦕): another run of 2. So another count.\n\nSo column0 contributes 2 vertical lines.\n\nWait, but in a column, consecutive elements need to be the same.\n\nSo for column0:\n\nIndex 0: 💫, index1: 💫: same, run of 2: count 1.\n\nIndexes 2 and 3: both 🦕: run of 2: count 1.\n\nWhat about indexes 1-2: different, so they don't form a run longer than each run.\n\nSo column0 has 2 vertical lines.\n\nNext column1:\n\nElements: [💫, 🐜, 🦩, 🦕]\n\nThese are all different, so runs are each length 1. No vertical lines here.\n\nColumn2:\n\nElements: [💫 (row0, column2 is 💫. Wait no—wait, row0's third element is index 2? Let me re-express.\n\nWait, I think I might get confused. Let's get each column correctly.\n\nOriginal board:\n\nRow0: 0:💫, 1:💫, 2:💫, 3:🦩\n\nRow1: 0:💫, 1:🐜, 2:🦩, 3:🦕\n\nRow2: 0:🦕, 1:🦩, 2:🦩, 3:💫\n\nRow3: 0:🦕, 1:🦕, 2:🐜, 3:🦕\n\nSo column0 for each row:\n\nRow0col0: 💫 (row 0, index 0)\n\nRow1col0: 💫 (row1, index0)\n\nRow2col0: 🦕 (row2, index0)\n\nRow3col0: 🦕 (row3, index0)\n\nSo column0 is [💫, 💫, 🦕, 🦕], as I thought earlier.\n\nSo in column0, two runs of 2 each.\n\nNext, column1:\n\nRow0: 💫 (index1)\n\nRow1: 🐜 (index1)\n\nRow2: 🦩 (index1)\n\nRow3: 🦕 (index1)\n\nAll different, so no runs >=2.\n\nNow column2:\n\nRow0: 💫 (index2)\n\nRow1: 🦩 (index2)\n\nRow2: 🦩 (index2)\n\nRow3: 🐜 (index2)\n\nSo the elements in column2 are [💫, 🦩, 🦩, 🐜].\n\nCheck for runs:\n\nBetween row0 and row1: different.\n\nRow1 and row2: same (🦩), so run of 2 in rows 1-2.\n\nWhat about row2 and row3? row2 is 🦩, row3 is 🐜. Different. So the run is only rows1-2. Length is 2: count 1.\n\nSo column2 has 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🦩 (index3)\n\nRow1: 🦕 (index3)\n\nRow2: 💫 (index3)\n\nRow3: 🦕 (index3)\n\nSo elements: [🦩, 🦕, 💫, 🦕].\n\nNo consecutive same elements. So no runs. So column3 contributes 0.\n\nSo for vertical lines, the counts are:\n\ncolumn0: 2\n\ncolumn2: 1\n\nOthers: 0.\n\nSo total vertical lines: 2 +1 =3.\n\nSo overall, horizontal lines are 3, vertical lines 3. So total count=6.\n\nWait, wait. Let's recount.\n\nWait, horizontal lines: rows 0 (1), 2 (1), 3 (1): total 3.\n\nVertical lines:\n\ncolumn0: run at top (💫💫 → 2), run at bottom (🦕🦕 → 2): 2 lines.\n\ncolumn2: run in row1 and row2 (🦩🦩 → 2): 1 line.\n\nSo yes, 3 vertical lines.\n\nTotal is 3+3=6.\n\nWait, but wait! Let me check again to make sure I didn't miss any.\n\nCheck the board again.\n\nRow0: three 💫 in a row—counts as 1.\n\nRow1: no runs.\n\nRow2: two 🦩—counts as 1.\n\nRow3: two 🦕 in first two positions—counts as 1. So 3 horizontal.\n\nFor vertical columns:\n\nColumn0 has two runs of 2: 💫,💫 and 🦕,🦕. So 2 lines.\n\nColumn2: two 🦩 in rows 1 and 2: 1 line.\n\n Columns 1 and 3: nothing.\n\nSo vertical lines: 2 + 1 =3.\n\nThus, 3+3=6.\n\nBut wait, is there any run longer than 2? Like, for example, in a column or row. Let me think.\n\nNo, in row0, three in a row, but that's still a single run.

{"board":[["🦒","🦜","🦖","🦜"],["🦖","🦒","🦜","🦜"],["😁","🦖","😁","🦖"],["🦒","🦜","🦜","🦖"]],"response":["<think>\nOkay, I have this problem where I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines on a 4x4 board made of emojis. Each line must consist of the same emoji and be at least length 2. So I need to go through each possible line both horizontally and vertically and check if all elements are the same. Oh, but wait, is a line just a continuous sequence? I think so. So for each cell in the board, I should check in all possible directions—left\/right for horizontal, up\/down for vertical.\n\nLet me sketch the board first. It's a 4x4 grid arranged as rows. Let me write out each row clearly because I might make a mistake reading them otherwise.\n\nRow 1: 🦒 🦜 🦖 🦜\nRow 2: 🦖 🦒 🦜 🦜\nRow 3: 😁 🦖 😁 🦖\nRow 4: 🦒 🦜 🦜 🦖\n\nNow, for each cell, I'll look to the right and below, because checking in all four directions might overlap, but perhaps this approach will capture all possible lines without double-counting.\n\nWait, no. Because a line can be in any direction—like, looking to the right for horizontal lines, or down for vertical. But for each possible line, we need to make sure that it's consecutive. So perhaps for each cell, I should check towards the right (for horizontal lines starting here) and down (for vertical starting here). That way, each possible line is only checked once from its starting point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe considering the problem is just to count all lines in any direction; so for each cell, I could check to see how long the line is in all four possible directions (left, right, up, down), but that might get complex. Hmm, maybe it's better to check in each possible direction for each cell, but avoid overcounting.\n\nWait, another approach: For horizontal lines, check each row, and count all consecutive sequences in that row that are 2 or longer. Similarly, for vertical lines, check each column and count all such sequences. But wait, each of these individual sequences is a line.\n\nSo perhaps the way to do this is:\n\n1. For each row, scan left to right, and count all runs of same emojis with length >=2. For example, in row 1, the emojis are A B C B. Wait: 🦒 🦜 🦖 🦜. So no two in a row except perhaps if any adjacent duplicates.\n\n2. For each column, scan top to bottom, checking for runs of same emojis with length >=2.\n\nSo let me first handle the horizontal lines for all rows.\n\nRow 1: 🦒, 🦜, 🦖, 🦜\n\nCheck horizontally:\nLook for consecutive same emojis. Between positions 1 and 2: 🦒 and 🦜 are different. Then 2 and 3: 🦜, 🦖—different. 3 and4: 🦖, 🦜—different. So no horizontal lines in row 1 of length ≥2.\n\nRow 2: 🦖, 🦒, 🦜, 🦜\n\nCheck:\n1-2: 🦖 vs 🦒: no. 2-3: 🦒 vs 🦜: no. 3-4: 🦜 vs 🦜: same. So from 3 to 4 is a length 2 line. So count as 1.\n\nRow 3: 😁, 🦖, 😁, 🦖\n\nCheck 1-2: no. 2-3? Different. 3-4? 😁 vs 🦖 is different. So no horizontal lines here.\n\nRow4: 🦒 🦜 🦜 🦖\n\n1-2: different. 2-3: same (🦜). Then 3-4: different. So 2-3 is a length 2. So count as 1.\n\nSo total horizontal lines are 1 (row2) +1 (row4) = 2.\n\nNow for vertical lines. For each column, check each cell and the cell below to see if they are the same.\n\nThere are 4 columns, each with 4 rows. So 4 columns to check.\n\nColumn 1:\nRows 1: 🦒\nRow2:🦖\nRow3:😁\nRow4:🦒\nCheck row1-row2: 🦒 vs 🦖: different. row2-row3: no. row3-row4? 😁 vs 🦒: no. No vertical lines in column1.\n\nColumn2:\nRow1:🦜\nRow2:🦒\nRow3:🦖\nRow4:🦜\nCheck row1-row2: different. row2-row3: different. row3-row4: different. So no lines here.\n\nColumn3:\nRow1:🦖\nRow2:🦜\nRow3:😁\nRow4:🦜\n\nCheck 1-2: different. 2-3: 🦜 vs 😁: no. 3-4: 😁 vs 🦜: no. So no lines.\n\nColumn4:\nAll rows in column4:\n\nRow1: 🦜\nRow2: 🦜\nRow3: 🦖\nRow4: 🦖\n\nCheck row1-row2: same (🦜). So length 2 line, count as 1.\n\nrow2-row3: 🦜 vs 🦖: no.\n\nrow3-row4: 🦖 and 🦖: same, so another line of length 2. Count as 1.\n\nSo column4 contributes 2 lines.\n\nWait, wait. Because a vertical line is made by consecutive same symbols going down. So row1 and row2 in column4 have 🦜 each; that's a line of length 2. Similarly, row3 and row4 have 🦖 each, another line of length 2. So 2 lines from column4.\n\nSo vertical lines are 2.\n\nAre there any other vertical lines that I'm missing?\n\nWait, how about the line that may extend beyond two cells? For instance, if three same emojis are in a column, that would create two lines of length 2. But in our problem, do we count them as separate lines or as one line? Because per the question, each line is a contiguous segment.\n\nFor example, if column with A, A, A:\n\nIt has lines starting at row1 (covers rows 1-2), and starting at row2 (covers rows 2-3). So is there a line of length 3? No, because the problem is to count lines of length 2 or more. Wait, in the problem statement, is a line of length 3 counted as one line, regardless of possible subsegments?\n\nAh, right, this might require some clarification. Because if three same emojis form a vertical line, that's a single line of length 3, which counts as one. Or, in our initial approach, would the algorithm count how many such lines? But wait, the question says to count each possible line. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem wants the count of individual lines. So each maximal consecutive same emoji sequence counts as one. Because for example, in column4 row1-row2 is a line, row3-row4 is another. Those are maximal if they are separate.\n\nWait, perhaps for this problem, all contiguous same-emoji lines (horizontal or vertical) of length >=2 are counted, regardless of whether they are part of a longer line. Or, perhaps each distinct line is considered as whether any such line exists. Wait, I think I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the question says 'the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.' So perhaps each possible line is to be considered a count. But that would potentially count overlapping lines. Alternatively, maybe the question wants the count of all maximal paths. Let me read the problem again: it says 'the total count of such lines as the answer.' So each line is a separate line, regardless of being part of a longer line.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me return to the problem to ensure I understand correctly.\n\nThe task is: count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with length 2 or longer.\n\nBased on the sample given, perhaps each maximal streak of same emojis (length ≥2) is counted once.\n\nSo, in row2, there are two 🦜s in a row. That's a single horizontal line of length 2.\n\nSimilarly, in row4, two 🦜s in a row, that's another.\n\nIn column4, there are two separate lines: 🦜 🦜 and 🦖 🦖, each of length 2. So in total, 2 (horizontal) + 2 (vertical) =4 lines.\n\nSo the answer would be 4.\n\nWait, but wait in the column4, we have two vertical lines. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at column4 rows:\nRow1: 🦜\nRow2: 🦜 → So rows 1 and 2 form a line.\nRow3: 🦖 → Rows 3 and 4 form another line.\n\nSo that's two vertical lines.\n\nSo in total, 1 horizontal from row2, 1 horizontal from row4, and 2 vertical from column4.\n\nSo 1+1+2 =4.\n\nWait no, because in the vertical, there's a line of two 🦜s, and a line of two 🦖s. So 2 lines.\n\nThen horizontal: row2 has a line and row4 has a line. 2 lines. So 2+2=4 total.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps perhaps I missed some lines.\n\nWait, let's check each possible line:\n\nStarting with horizontal lines:\n\nRow1: no lines.\nRow2: 🦖, 🦒, [🦜, 🦜] → 1 line.\nRow3: no lines.\nRow4: [🦜, 🦜] → 1 line.\nSo horizontal lines: 2.\n\nVertical lines:\n\nColumn1: no lines.\n\nColumn2: no lines.\n\nColumn3: no lines.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow1: 🦜; row2: 🦜 → line of 2 → count 1.\n\nRow3: 🦖; row4: 🦖 → line of 2 → count 1.\n\nSo vertical lines: 2.\n\nThus, total lines counted: 4.\n\nIs there any other line?\n\nWait, perhaps in other columns but I've missed some.\n\nWait, for example, in row3, columns1 and 3 have 😁. But not in a line. So no.\n\nWhat about some other rows?\n\nWait, let me check row2 again: 🦖 🦒 🦜 🦜.\n\nOnly the last two are same. So that's one horizontal.\n\nRow3's top to bottom in columns:\n\nFor column1, row3 is 😁; row4: 🦒 → different.\n\nColumn2 row3: 🦖; row4: 🦜 → different. So no vertical lines here.\n\nColumn3 row3: 😁; row4: 🦜 → different.\n\nSo the only vertical lines are in column4.\n\nAre there any longer lines that are >=2 and would count more?\n\nAn example might help. Suppose there's a 3-length vertical all same emojis. Then that would count as one line. For example:\n\nCol4: rows 1-2 same, and rows 3-4 same as each other but different from 1. So two lines.\n\nIf Col4 rows 1-2-3 are same, that would be one vertical line.\n\nSimilarly, horizontal same emojis of length 3 would be one line.\n\nIn the given problem, no lines longer than 2, so no need to worry.\n\nWait, but perhaps I've overlooked some possible vertical lines.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for other possible lines in other columns.\n\nLet me try column 4 again. Row1 is 🦜, row2 is 🦜, which is a vertical line. So count 1.\n\nRow3 is 🦖, row4 is 🦖, that's another line. So 2.\n\nNow any other vertical lines elsewhere? Let me check column1 rows again.\n\nOnly row4 is 🦒, and row1 is 🦒 as well (column1)—they are stacked: row1 is 🦒, row4 is 🦒. So in column1, it's row1 🦒, row2 🦖, row3 😁, row4 🦒.\n\nBetween row3 and row4: different.\n\nBetween row4 and ... ? Only three rows. So no line in column1.\n\nWhat about column2: row4 is 🦜. Only one occurrence in the column.\n\nRow2 of column2 is 🦒. So no.\n\nRow3 is 🦖, column2.\n\nNo connections.\n\nSo yes, no other vertical lines.\n\nThus, total lines: horizontal (2) + vertical (2) =4.\n\nWait, but wait—what about the other vertical line in column4?\n\nNo, I think I have them covered. So that's four lines.\n\nBut wait, I think I made a mistake earlier on the horizontal lines.\n\nLooking back, row2: 🦖 🦒 🦜 🦜. The last two are same → length 2. So yes, count 1.\n\nRow4: 🦒 🦜 🦜 🦖 → row4 has 🦜 🦜 in positions 2-3, length 2 → count 1.\n\nWait, but in row3: 😁 🦖 😁 🦖. Are these in any way connected? Each is separate, so no horizontal lines.\n\nSo, yes, 2 horizontal lines.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a longer line that includes more same emojis. Let me re-examine.\n\nNo, row2 and row4 only have two at the end.\n\nWhat about vertical lines, wait row1 column2 is 🦜, and row4 column2 is also 🦜. Wait, that's same emoji. So are they in the same column? No, because columns are vertical, rows are horizontal.\n\nWait, my mistake. So column2 is not the same as row4's third emoji. Wait, no. Let's reorganize.\n\nNo, column2 is the second element of each row.\n\nLet me re-examine the board:\n\nRow as arranged:\n\nRow 1: 🦒 (col1), 🦜 (col2), 🦖(col3), 🦜 (col4)\nRow 2: 🦖 (col1), 🦒 (col2), 🦜 (col3), 🦜 (col4)\nRow3: 😁 (col1), 🦖 (col2), 😁 (col3), 🦖 (col4)\nRow4: 🦒 (col1), 🦜 (col2), 🦜 (col3), 🦖 (col4)\n\nSo column2 (second column) is: 🦜, 🦒, 🦖, 🦜.\n\nLooking at column2:\n\nRow1: 🦜 (col2)\nRow2: 🦒\nRow3: 🦖\nRow4: 🦜 → all different from each other, so no vertical lines here.\n\nSo only in column4 are there the vertical lines.\n\nSo after rechecking, yes total is 2 (h) + 2 (v) =4.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more, on a given 4x4 board.

{"board":[["🐢","🐍","💥","🐢"],["🐍","💥","🐍","💥"],["🐍","🐢","🐍","🐍"],["🐍","🐍","💥","💥"]],"response":["<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to solve this game problem where I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines on a board made up of emojis. Each line has to be made of the same emoji and have a length of two or more. Okay, let's break this down step by step to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the board. From the input, it's a 4x4 grid. Let me write it out row by row to see it clearly.\n\nThe board is:\nRow 1: 🐢 🐍 💥 🐢\nRow 2: 🐍 💥 🐍 💥\nRow 3: 🐍 🐢 🐍 🐍\nRow 4: 🐍 🐍 💥 💥\n\nHmm, I think I should go row by row checking for horizontal lines first, and then check each column for vertical lines. Also, I should look for lines of 2, 3, or 4 in length.\n\nLet me start with the horizontal lines.\n\nRow 1: 🐢🐍💥🐢\nLooking for consecutive same emojis:\n- 🐢 followed by 🐍 (different)\n- 🐍 followed by 💥 (different)\n- 💥 followed by 🐢 (different)\nSo, no lines here longer than 1.\n\nRow 2: 🐍💥🐍💥\nAgain, check each position:\n- 🐍, then 💥 (different)\n- 💥, then 🐍 (different)\n- 🐍, then 💥 (different)\nNo horizontal lines in this row.\n\nRow 3: 🐍🐢🐍🐍\nChecking each consecutive pair:\n- 🐍 to 🐢: different.\n- 🐢 to 🐍: different.\n- 🐍 to 🐍: same. So that's a pair, so a line of 2. So one line here.\nMoving further, since after that the next is nothing beyond the end. So row 3 contributes 1 line.\n\nRow 4: 🐍🐍💥💥\nCheck each pair:\n- 🐍 followed by 🐍: same, so that's a line of 2, but wait, are there more consecutive?\nWait, first two are same (positions 1&2): that's two. Then position 2 is same as 3? No, because 2 is 🐍, 3 is 💥—different. Oh wait, positions 3 and4 are 💥 and 💥, so that's another pair. So row 4 contributes two lines of 2 each. So two lines in row 4.\n\nSo total horizontal lines from rows: row3 gives 1, row4 gives 2. So horizontal total so far is 3.\n\nNow, for vertical lines, I need to check each column in each row. So maybe I should construct the grid as columns.\n\nLet's list the columns as 1 to 4. Each column has four elements.\n\nColumn 1: elements from row1 to row4:\n🐢 (row1, col1)\n🐍 (row2)\n🐍 (row3)\n🐍 (row4)\nLooking for consecutive same emojis going down. Let's see if there are sequences here.\n\nRow1 to row2: 🐢 to 🐍—no.\nRow2 to row3: 🐍 to 🐍—same. That's two in a column. But do they continue? Row3 to row4: 🐍 — same. So that's a vertical line of 3 🐍's in column1. How many lines is that?\n\nWait, a line can be any 2 or longer. So how to count that. For a vertical line that's 3, it can be broken down into two lines: (row2-row3) and (row3-row4), each of 2. But wait no, that might not be the correct way because the entire length is 3. So how does counting work in that case.\n\nWait, in similar problems, like the candy crush, a line of 3 is considered as one line for 3, but in this question, it's whether the line is formed by 2 or more. So each contiguous block of same emojis in a row (horizontal) or column (vertical) of length 2 or more counts as one line. So for a vertical column with 3 same emojis, that's a single line. But wait, wait, the problem is to count the number of lines formed by same emojis, with a length of two or more.\n\nWait, for example, say you have a vertical column where all 4 are same, that's a single line of length 4, which counts as one. So in column1, the first element is 🐢, then followed by three 🐍s. So starting at row2, there's a vertical line of 3 🐍s. So that's one vertical line.\n\nWait, but in column1, the sequence would be rows 2,3,4: all 🐍.\n\nSo that's a vertical line of length 3.\n\nWait, but when I started, row1 was 🐢, different from row2's 🐍, so the lines start at row2.\n\nSo column1: one line of length 3.\n\nSimilarly, I think that in vertical lines, each continuous segment of same emojis is counted as one if it's length is 2 or more.\n\nAnother example: if two elements are same, then two more same, but the first two are same as the next two, then it'd mean one longer line. So perhaps if a column has four same, that's a single line of 4, which counts as one.\n\nTherefore, in column1, there's one line.\n\nNow, moving to column 2.\n\nElements from column2:\n\nRow1: 🐍\nRow2: 💥\nRow3: 🐢\nRow4: 🐍\n\nLooking down, all different. No vertical line here. So no lines in column2.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow1: 💥\nRow2: 🐍\nRow3: 🐍\nRow4: 💥\n\nCheck for consecutive same:\n\nRow3 and Row4? Wait, no. Let me list out the column as row1 to row4:\n\n💥 (row1)\n🐍 (row2)\n🐍 (row3)\n💥 (row4)\n\nSo between row2 and 3: 🐍 and 🐍, same. So that's a pair. So vertical line of 2. So one line in column3.\n\nRow3 is 🐍, next is row4's 💥: different.\n\nSo column3 has one line.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow1: 🐢 (col4)\nRow2: 💥 (col4)\nRow3: 🐍 (col4)\nRow4: 💥 (col4)\n\nSo each row is different from the next. No line here.\n\nAlso, row3 is 🐍, row4 is 💥: different.\n\nSo column4 contributes zero.\n\nSo now, the vertical lines are column1: 1 line, column3: 1 line.\n\nSo vertical lines: 2.\n\nWait, so adding horizontal and vertical.\n\nHorizontal lines: 3\n\nVertical lines: 2\n\nTotal lines: 5.\n\nWait, but let me double-check for both horizontal and vertical.\n\nWait, maybe I missed some lines.\n\nLet me review the horizontal lines again.\n\nSo for each row, any consecutive two or more same? Let's go row by row.\n\nRow1: 🐢 🐍 💥 🐢 → no horizontal lines.\n\nRow2: 🐍 💥 🐍 💥 → Checking each pair:\n\nsequence:\n\n🐍 (1) and 💥 (2): different.\n\n💥 (2) and 🐍 (3): different.\n\n🐍 (3) and 💥 (4): different. So no lines.\n\nSo horizontal in row2: 0.\n\nRow3: 🐍 🐢 🐍 🐍.\n\nCheck pairs:\n\npositions 1-2: 🐍 vs 🐢: no.\n\npositions2-3: 🐢 vs 🐍: no.\n\npositions3-4: 🐍 vs 🐍: same. So that's a line of 2. So row3: 1 line.\n\nRow4: 🐍🐍💥💥.\n\nCheck pairs:\n\npositions1-2: same (🐍🐍 → line of 2)\n\npositions2-3: 🐍 vs 💥 → different.\n\npositions3-4: 💥 vs 💥 → same (line of 2)\n\nSo two lines in row4.\n\nThus, total horizontal lines: row3 (1) + row4 (2) = 3.\n\nGood.\n\nNow for vertical:\n\nLooking for each column to have same in any consecutive positions across rows, forming a line of 2 or more.\n\nColumn1:\n\n🐢 (row1), 🐍 (row2), 🐍 (row3), 🐍 (row4).\n\nSo from row2 to row4, all 🐍s.\n\nNow, in vertical, does that count as one line of 3, or as two lines?\n\nWait, the problem says count the number of lines formed, each line being length of 2 or more.\n\nA vertical line that's three in a row counts as a single line.\n\nBecause it's a single continuous line, regardless of how long it is beyond 2.\n\nSo for column1, lines? Let me break it down.\n\nBetween row2 and 3: same (row2 and 3 are 🐍→ so that's a line of 2.\n\nRow3 and 4 are also same 🐍, so another line of 2.\n\nWait, but row2,3,4 are all same as each other—so is that a single line of 3?\n\nWait, the problem is to count the number of lines, where each line is 2 or more. So the same continuous sequence would count as one.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Wait, in horizontal approach, a single line can be formed by four same emojis, and that's one line.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the line is formed by same emojis and has a length of 2 or more. So any continuous line of same emojis of length 2, 3, or 4 counts as one.\n\nWait no—no, a longer line is just longer, but in the problem, each long line is a single count.\n\nSo for column1, the 🐢 is row1; the rest three (rows2-4) are 🐍.\n\nSo that's a vertical line of length 3: once.\n\nSo column1 contributes 1.\n\nBut wait, the line can be said to have three segments, but it's a single continuous line.\n\nSo column1: contributes one vertical line.\n\nBut maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, or perhaps I'm overcomplicating: maybe each column or row is scanned for consecutive runs of 2 or more same and each such run counts as a single line, regardless of how long it is.\n\nSo in the example of a column with 4 same emojis, it's a single line.\n\nIn a column with 3 same, it's a single line.\n\nIn a column with 2 same, also a single line. Even when maybe the two begin at row2 and 3, but another two runs also exist.\n\nSo in column1, we have a single line because there's a run from row2 to row4 (3 rows), same emojis.\n\nSimilarly, let's reassess all columns.\n\nSo column1: one line (🐍 from row2-4).\n\nColumn2: All different.\n\nColumn3: From row2 and 3: both 🐍 → same → line of 2. Rows3 and 4: different. So column3 contributes one line.\n\nColumn4: row3 and 4: different from each other (row3 is 🐍, row4 is 💥?), no. Wait, row4 of column4 is what?\n\nWait the board as given again:\n\nRow1: 🐢 🐍 💥 🐢\n\nRow2: 🐍 💥 🐍 💥\n\nRow3: 🐍 🐢 🐍 🐍\n\nRow4: 🐍 🐍 💥 💥\n\nSo column4:\n\nrow1: 🐢\n\nrow2: 💥\n\nrow3: 🐍\n\nrow4: 💥 → column4 entries: 🐢, 💥, 🐍, 💥 → all distinct except not; no two same in a row.\n\nSo column4: no lines.\n\nThus, vertical lines: column1 (1) + column3 (1) → total 2.\n\nWait, but another check in column3: row3 is 🐍, row4 is 🐍 ? No, row4, column3 is 🐍? Wait, row4: 🐍 🐍 💥 💥 → so column3 for row4 is 💥.\n\nWait, column3 entries:\n\nRow1: 💥\n\nRow2: 🐍\n\nRow3: 🐍\n\nRow4: 💥\n\nWait, so column3's row2 is 🐍, row3: 🐍 → same → line of two.\n\nBut also, looking at the other way: the third row is 🐍 and third column? No, perhaps not. So column3 has a vertical line of two in rows2-3.\n\nSo, two vertical lines in total.\n\nSo with the vertical lines, that's 2, and horizontal 3, sum is 5.\n\nWait, let me make a list:\n\nHorizontal lines:\nRow3: 1\nRow4: 2\nTotal: 3\n\nVertical lines:\nColumn1:1 (from row2 to row4)\nColumn3:1 (rows 2-3)\nTotal:2\n\nAdding 3+2=5.\n\nOkay, that's my initial assessment.\n\nBut let me double-check each part.\n\nAnother approach for vertical lines: for each column, look at each position and see if it starts a vertical line.\n\nFor column1: row1 is 🐢, row2 is 🐍. Not same as row1, so no run starting at row1. Row2 is 🐍, row3 is 🐍: so run of at least 2 here. Then row4 is same as row3, so the run becomes 3. Then we have a line of length 3, which counts as one line.\n\nSo column1: 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn2: all different; no lines.\n\nColumn3: row2 is 🐍, row3 is 🐍 → same. Run of length 2. So that's one line. Then row3 and row4 are different. So column3: 1 line.\n\nColumn4: all different; no lines.\n\nTherefore, vertical lines: 2.\n\nSame for horizontal.\n\nSo the total is indeed 5.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any lines in the rows.\n\nLooking again.\n\nRow4: 🐍 🐍 💥 💥.\n\n- The first two 🐍s: line of 2: counted.\n- The last two 💥s: line of 2: counted.\nSo two horizontal lines in row4.\n\nRow3: line in the last two positions (🐍🐍).\n\nSo horizontal lines: 3 in total.\n\nSo 3+2 = 5.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: perhaps lines can be of length >= 2, and each occurrence counts once per the direction.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is 5.\n\nHmm, but now thinking, is that the case? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with horizontal lines.\n\nWait, row4 has two lines: (1,2): 🐍🐍 and (3,4): 💥💥. So two lines, correct.\n\nSo combining all, the total is 5.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more on a 4x4 board. Each continuous segment of same emojis in a row (horizontal) or column (vertical) is counted as a single line if its length is 2 or more.\n\n### Board representation:\n```\nRow 1: 🐢 🐍 💥 🐢\nRow 2: 🐍 💥 🐍 💥\nRow 3: 🐍 🐢 🐍 🐍\nRow 4: 🐍 🐍 💥 💥\n```\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### **Horizontal Lines:**\n1. **Row 1**: 🐢 🐍 💥 🐢  \n   - No consecutive emojis are the same.  \n   - Contribution: 0 lines.\n\n2. **Row 2**: 🐍 💥 🐍 💥  \n   - No consecutive emojis are the same.  \n   - Contribution: 0 lines.\n\n3. **Row 3**: 🐍 🐢 🐍 🐍  \n   - The last two emojis (🐍 🐍) form a line of length 2.  \n   - Contribution: 1 line.\n\n4. **Row 4**: 🐍 🐍 💥 💥  \n   - The first two emojis (🐍 🐍) form a line of length 2.  \n   - The last two emojis (💥 💥) form a line of length 2.  \n   - Contribution: 2 lines.\n\n**Total horizontal lines**: 1 (from Row 3) + 2 (from Row 4) = 3.\n\n---\n\n#### **Vertical Lines:**\n1. **Column 1**:  \n   - Row 1: 🐢  \n   - Row 2: 🐍  \n   - Row 3: 🐍  \n   - Row 4: 🐍  \n   - The emojis in Rows 2, 3, and 4 (🐍 🐍 🐍) form a line of length 3.  \n   - Contribution: 1 line.\n\n2. **Column 2**:  \n   - Row 1: 🐍  \n   - Row 2: 💥  \n   - Row 3: 🐢  \n   - Row 4: 🐍  \n   - No consecutive emojis are the same.  \n   - Contribution: 0 lines.\n\n3. **Column 3**:  \n   - Row 1: 💥  \n   - Row 2: 🐍  \n   - Row 3: 🐍  \n   - Row 4: 💥  \n   - The emojis in Rows 2 and 3 (🐍 🐍) form a line of length 2.  \n   - Contribution: 1 line.\n\n4. **Column 4**:  \n   - Row 1: 🐢  \n   - Row 2: 💥  \n   - Row 3: 🐍  \n   - Row 4: 💥  \n   - No consecutive emojis are the same.  \n   - Contribution: 0 lines.\n\n**Total vertical lines**: 1 (from Column 1) + 1 (from Column 3) = 2.\n\n---\n\n### Total Count:\n- Horizontal lines: 3  \n- Vertical lines: 2  \n- **Total**: 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nAnswer: 5"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

{"board":[["🥀","🥀","🐘","🐘"],["🐘","🐘","🦂","🐆"],["🐆","🐆","🦂","🥀"],["🥀","🦂","🦂","🥀"]],"response":["<think>\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have a board made up of emojis, and I have to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more. Hmm, let's see. \n\nFirst, I'll try to visualize the board. It's a 4x4 grid, so four rows and four columns. Each cell has an emoji. The board is provided as:\n\nRow 1: 🥀 🥀 🐘 🐘\nRow 2: 🐘 🐘 🦂 🐆\nRow 3: 🐆 🐆 🦂 🥀\nRow 4: 🥀 🦂 🦂 🥀\n\nWait, maybe I should write them out in a grid structure to better understand. Let's do that.\n\nSo, the grid looks like this:\n\nRow 0: 🥀 🥀 🐘 🐘\nRow 1: 🐘 🐘 🦂 🐆\nRow 2: 🐆 🐆 🦂 🥀\nRow 3: 🥀 🦂 🦂 🥀\n\nWait, I think I might have mixed up the rows. Let me double-check. The user provided the board as:\n\nLine 1: 🥀🥀🐘🐘\nLine 2: 🐘🐘🦂🐆\nLine 3: 🐆🐆🦂🥀\nLine 4: 🥀🦂🦂🥀\n\nSo, rows 0 to 3 in my grid will correspond to lines 1 to 4, each with four elements. So the grid would be:\n\nRow 0: Cells (0,0)=🥀, (0,1)=🥀, (0,2)=🐘, (0,3)=🐘\nRow 1: (1,0)=🐘, (1,1)=🐘, (1,2)=🦂, (1,3)=🐆\nRow 2: (2,0)=🐆, (2,1)=🐆, (2,2)=🦂, (2,3)=🥀\nRow 3: (3,0)=🥀, (3,1)=🦂, (3,2)=🦂, (3,3)=🥀\n\nNow, my task is to go through each row and column and check for consecutive same emojis of length 2 or more, counting each such line as 1.\n\nI should start by checking all horizontal lines. For each row, scan from left to right and identify sequences. Similarly, for vertical lines, scan each column from top to bottom.\n\nLet me start with horizontal lines.\n\nStarting with Row 0:\nPositions 0-1: 🥀🥀 → that's a horizontal line of length 2. So that's one.\nPositions 2-3: 🐘🐘 → another horizontal line, so that's another one. So row 0 contributes 2.\n\nRow 1:\nPositions 0-1: 🐘🐘 → that's a line, length 2. Next, positions 1-2: 🐘 vs 🦂? They're different. So only one from the first part. No other sequences except perhaps 0-1. So row 1 contributes 1.\n\nRow 2:\nPositions 0-1: 🐆🐆 → that's a line. Length 2. So that's one. Positions 2-3: 🦂 vs 🥀? No. So row 2 adds 1.\n\nRow 3:\nPositions 0: 🥀. Position 1: 🦂, same as next position? No. Wait, wait. Row 3 has 🥀, 🦂, 🦂, 🥀. So positions 1-2 are 🦂🦂, which makes another horizontal line. So row 3 contributes 1.\n\nSo adding the horizontal lines: 2 (row0) +1 (row1) +1 (row2) +1 (row3) = 5.\n\nNow, checking vertical lines. Let's go column by column.\n\nColumn 0:\nCheck each cell from row 0 to row 3: 🥀 (row0), 🐘 (row1), 🐆 (row2), 🥀 (row3). So each is different → no vertical lines here.\n\nColumn 1:\nCells in column1: 🥀 (row0), 🐘 (row1), 🐆 (row2), 🦂 (row3). All different? Let's see:\n\nRow0: 🥀\nRow1: 🐘\nRow2: 🐆\nRow3: 🦂 → all different. So no vertical lines here.\n\nColumn 2:\nCells in column2: 🐘 (row0), 🦂 (row1), 🦂 (row2), 🦂(row3). Wait, row0 is 🐘. row1 is 🦂. row2 is 🦂 again. row3 is 🦂. So looking at consecutive cells in this column.\n\nSo, let's see for vertical lines:\n\nLooking from top down:\nRow0 to row1: 🐘 vs 🦂 → different. → no line.\nRow1 to row2: 🦂 vs 🦂 → same. That's a length of 2. So that would count as 1.\nRow2 to row3: 🦂 vs 🦂 → another same. That's another line of length 2. So this column contributes 2 vertical lines. \n\nColumn3:\nCells: 🐘 (row0), 🐆 (row1), 🥀 (row2), 🥀 (row3). Let's look for same consecutive cells.\n\nRow0: 🐘, row1: 🐆 → different. \nRow1: 🐆, row2: 🥀 → different.\nRow2: 🥀, row3: 🥀 → same. So a vertical line of length 2 here. So column3 contributes 1.\n\nSo total vertical lines: column0 has 0, column1 0, column2 2, column3 1 → 2+1=3.\n\nSo total lines are horizontal (5) + vertical (3) = 8.\n\nWait a minute, but wait—no. Because for vertical lines, in column2, rows 1,2,3 are 🦂, 🦂, 🦂. So from row1 to row2 is one line, and row2 to row3 is another line. So that's two lines when the sequence is of length 3, but since it's vertical, so if three in a row, then it contributes two lines. So that's correct.\n\nSo total lines: 5 horizontal and 3 vertical → total 8.\n\nWait, but wait again. Let me double-check. Because sometimes I might have missed something. Let me re-examine each row and column.\n\nStarting with rows again.\n\nRow0: two lines. Correct.\n\nRow1: only the first two. Correct.\n\nRow2: first two. Correct.\n\nRow3: last two elements? Wait, no, row3 is 🥀, 🦂, 🦂, 🥀. Wait, positions 1 and 2 are 🦂 🦂, but position3 is 🥀. So that's a line of length 2, correct. So one line. Correct.\n\nNow the columns:\n\nColumn0: all different. Correct.\n\nColumn1: All different. Correct.\n\nColumn2:\n\n- Row0: 🐘\n- Row1: 🦂\n- Row2: 🦂 ← same as row1. So that's a line from row1 to row2 → 1 line.\n- Row3: 🦂 ← same as row2, so another line from row2 to row3 → another line. So two lines here. So column2 contributes 2.\n\nColumn3:\n\n- Row0: 🐘\n- Row1: 🐆\n- Row2: 🥀\n- Row3: 🥀 same as row2, so one line.\n\nSo vertical lines: 2 + 1 =3.\n\nSo total is 5+3=8.\n\nWait, but another approach: in rows, we also have the possibility of longer lines (like more than two). For example, in a row like 🥀🥀🥀, that would count as 2 lines (because any consecutive two contributes—wait, no, for a triplet, it's a single line, but the way the question is phrased, any line of 2 or more, and count each such line once. Wait, wait, the problem says to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines. So I'm a bit confused now. \n\nWait, let me re-read the problem. The question is: \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So each line is a contiguous sequence. So in row0, we have two separate lines: the first two 🥀 and then the next two 🐘. Each is counted separately.\n\nWait no, row 0 is 🥀🥀🐘🐘. So, that's two separate horizontal lines, each of length 2. So yes.\n\nWait, but what about if a line is longer than 2? Like three in a row. For example, if a row had 🥀🥀🥀, that would be considered a single line of length 3. So it's one occurrence. Similarly, a row like 🥀🥀🥀🐘 would have a single line of 3 🥀s.\n\nSo, during the initial analysis for horizontal lines, for each row, I've checked any consecutive same emojis of length ≥2 as a single line per occurrence. \n\nWait no, looking back, let me clarify:\n\nI think in my initial approach for each row, I considered any consecutive sequence of two or more, and for that row, sum all such lines. But perhaps I should check each possible run, whether it's overlapping or not.\n\nWait no: I think each row is processed by looking for runs.\n\nFor example, in row0, it's 🥀🥀🐘🐘: there's a run of 2 🥀, and a run of 2 🐘 → two lines.\n\nSo row0 contributes 2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother example: row1: 🐘🐘🦂🐆: runs of 2 🐘s, no others. So one contribution.\n\nSo for all rows, for all runs of 2 or more, contribute 1 each, regardless of how long the run is beyond 2.\n\nSame for the columns.\n\nWait wait, so in the first analysis, when handling column2, it's 🐘 (row0), then 🦂,🦂,🦂 in rows1,2,3. So how many vertical runs are there? From row1 to row2, and row2 to row3. So two runs. So two lines.\n\nSo that's correct as well.\n\nSo if a column has 3 same emojis in a row, that forms 2 separate lines (e.g., rows1-2 is a line, rows2-3 is another line). So each run is a line. So in the case of three in a column, how many lines? Two.\n\nIn that case, column2 has two vertical lines.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 5 horizontal, 3 vertical → 8.\n\nBut wait, what about other columns with runs?\n\nIn column0: all different, so no lines.\n\nColumn1: all different, as per the grid. Let me check: row0: 🥀, row1: 🐘, row2: 🐆, row3: 🦂 → all different. So no lines.\n\nColumn2: 🐘, 🦂, 🦂, 🦂.\n\nRow0 is 🐘, then row1 is 🦂, so different. Then row1 and row2 are 🦂s, then row2 and row3 are 🦂s again. So two lines.\n\nColumn3: as earlier, only rows2 and 3 are same, so one line.\n\nSo no issues so far.\n\nWait, is there any column that I've missed? Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at column0: \n\nRow0: 🥀\n\nRow1: 🐘 → different from row0.\n\nRow2: 🐆 → different from row1.\n\nRow3: 🥀 → different from row2.\n\nSo no vertical runs in column0.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow0: 🥀\n\nRow1: 🐘 → different.\n\nRow2: 🐆 → different.\n\nRow3: 🦂 → different.\n\nSo all are unique. So no lines.\n\nColumn2:\n\nYes, as before.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🐘 → row1 and others different.\n\nSo that's all.\n\nSo yes, 5+3=8.\n\nIs that the correct answer? Let me now look for any possible errors or overlooked runs.\n\nWait, what about row3: 🥀 🦂 🦂 🥀. So the two in the middle are 🦂, right. So that's a run. But any others? So they form one line in the horizontal direction.\n\nBut, wait, are there any vertical runs elsewhere?\n\nE.g., row3 has (3,0)=🥀, row2 has (2,0)=🐆. So row3.0 is 🥀, row2.0 was 🐆, so no.\n\nIs there any overlap I might have missed?\n\nLet me think about the vertical lines in column3 again:\n\nRow0: 🐘,\n\nRow1: 🐆 → different from row0,\n\nRow2: 🥀 → different from row1,\n\nRow3: 🥀 → same as row2 → so that's one line.\n\nSo yes, column3 has one vertical line.\n\nAny others? Let me check again.\n\nIn column1: No, looks like all are unique.\n\nWait, maybe in row3, column0: 🥀 is next to column0, row2 being 🐆. Not same.\n\nSo I think no.\n\nWait, what about row3: 🥀 🦂 🦂 🥀: so in vertical terms, for each position j in the row. Wait, no, vertical lines involve the same column. So for each column j, you check vertical.\n\nAlternatively, for each cell (i,j), check below for how many same in a row.\n\nWait, perhaps for all cells (i,j), check in the vertical direction if the cell below is the same as the current. Each such vertical pair is part of a line. But lines are contiguous; perhaps we have to count the number of vertical line segments, regardless of the length.\n\nBut wait, according to the problem statement, a line is any horizontal or vertical run of the same emoji, with length ≥2. So the count is the number of such runs, regardless of how long they are, as long as they are 2 or more in length. So a run of length 3 would count as 1 when considering the entire run, or would it generate 2 line segments (since it's three in a row, which includes two lines of two each)?\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify.\n\nThe problem statement says, count the number of lines (horizontal or vertical) formed by same emojis, length ≥2.\n\nSo a \"line\" is a contiguous sequence of same emojis in a row or column of length at least 2.\n\nSo if a row has four same emojis, that's one line of length four, which should be counted as 1 line, not two or three lines, even though it contains multiple runs that are >=2.\n\nWait, but no. Because perhaps overlapping lines are allowed. Wait, maybe not.\n\nBut perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let's think about a row like 🥀🥀🥀🥀. In this case, the entire row is a single line of length 4, so counts once. But wait, but according to the initial logic earlier, the row would contain several runs. For example:\n\nPositions 0-1: line of 2\n\n1-2: another line of 2\n\nSimilarly, 0-2: 3 in a row etc. But actually, the problem wants the number of lines, where each line is a maximal run. So a run as long as possible.\n\nWait no, perhaps it's not about maximal runs. Maybe every possible consecutive sequence of same emojis of length ≥2 counts as a line.\n\nSo in the case of a row of 4 same, it has 3 lines: positions 0-1, 1-2, 2-3.\n\nBut that can’t be right because in the given board, for example, row0, which has two separate runs, each contributing one each. So the initial approach counts each run whether they are contiguous in the row.\n\nWait, but in row0, as it's 🥀🥀🐘🐘, so that's two separate runs of length 2 each, which contributed two counts. So for a row like four of a kind, it would be one single run, but that counts as once.\n\nWait, no: I think the problem expects each maximal run. For example, if a row is AABBBCC, then the runs are AA (length 2), BBB (3), CC (2), so each is a line and counts as three lines.\n\nSo in that case, in row0, which runs as 🥀🥀 and 🐘🐘, contributes two lines. \n\nSo the approach of looking for all maximal runs in each row and column is correct, and each such run contributes one to the count if its length is ≥2.\n\nSo back to the board:\n\nIn horizontal runs, we have:\n\n- Row0: two runs of lengths 2, so two lines.\n\n- Row1: one run of 2, one line.\n\n- Row2: one run of 2, one line.\n\n- Row3: one run of 2, one line.\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 2 +1 +1 +1 =5.\n\nIn vertical runs:\n\nColumn2: 🐘 is row0, then 🦂🦂🦂 (rows1,2,3). So the vertical runs are from row1 to row2 (🦂🦂) and row2 to row3 (🦂🦂). But that's within a longer run. So actually, the run from row1 to row3 is three in a row, which is a single maximal vertical run of 3.\n\nIn this case, the vertical line would be considered as a single line of length 3, so counted once. Because the maximal run is three, so it's a single line. If that's the case, then in my initial analysis I made a mistake in counting. So how is this?\n\nWait, no. Wait, because when looking at each possible start and end, perhaps.\n\nWait, perhaps a run must be contiguous. For any group of same emojis in a column that are consecutive and same, regardless of the starting point, counts as one line as long as the run is ≥2.\n\nWait, the problem says a line is 'formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more'. So each such contiguous line counts. So, in column2, the three 🦂s form a single vertical line of length 3, so counts as one line, and the same in columns runs as length two, that's one line.\n\nWait no. Because in the columns:\n\nLooking at column2: row0: 🐘 (different), rows1-3: 🦂, which are same.\n\nSo from row1 to row3, it's a vertical run of 3 same emojis. So that's a single line of length 3, thus contributing 1 to the vertical lines.\n\nEarlier, my analysis counted it as 2 lines, which would be incorrect.\n\nSo I have a mistake in the earlier analysis. So that affects the count.\n\nWait no, wait: the problem statement says \"formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So a line of length 3 is a single line, not multiple. So in column2, the run from row1 to row3 is a single line of length 3, so that should be one, not two.\n\nSo let me recalculate the counts.\n\nHorizontal:\n\nSame as before:5.\n\nVertical:\n\nColumn0: no runs.\n\nColumn1: no runs.\n\nColumn2: run from row1 to row3 → one line.\n\nColumn3: run from row2 to row3 → one line.\n\nSo vertical lines: 1+1=2.\n\nWait, that would give total lines:5+2=7.\n\nBut wait, now, what about other columns?\n\nWait, the initial problem must have me confused.\n\nSo in initial approach, treating column2 as two runs of length 2—each 2-line, giving 2 lines. But maybe this is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps lines can be of any length >=2, and each must be a contiguous run, but the same run of longer length is considered as a single line.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the sample board may have an example. Let me try to think of the initial example given in the problem.\n\nNo, wait, I don't have a sample, but according to the problem statement, how the lines are counted.\n\nWhat's the correct way? Let's re-express:\n\nIf in a column, all three emojis are the same from row a to row b (all consecutive), and the length is >=2, then it's considered as 1 line, regardless of the length beyond 2.\n\nSo in column2, with a run of 3, count as 1 line.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps any run composed of the same emojis, as long as it's 2 or more consecutive rows\/columns.\n\nWait, in that case, a column with three same emojis would have runs:\n\nrows1-2 → line, rows2-3 → another line (but in reality, they form a longer run which includes both).\n\nBut according to this, a run of 3 would be considered as two lines, each of length 2, but actually, they overlap.\n\nBut wait, in this approach, for a column with three same, how would you count the lines?\n\nSuppose the column is: A A A.\n\nLooking for vertical lines:\n\n- Rows0-1: A A → one line.\n\n- Rows1-2: A A → second line.\n\nSo the same column would have two lines, even though it's a single run of three. Because it's formed by two consecutive pairs.\n\nBut I'm not sure which approach the problem expects. \n\nThe problem statement isn't clear on whether each maximal run counts as one, or all pairs (like overlapping runs) count as separate lines.\n\nWait, perhaps looking back at the initial example.\n\nIn the given board:\n\nIn row0, the first two and the last two are same. So two separate lines as the two are not connected.\n\nIn column2, the three 🦂s in rows1-3 form a single vertical line of length 3, thus count as one line.\n\nIn that case, the column2 would contribute only one line.\n\nSo in vertical lines, only two lines (column2:1, column3:1).\n\nWait, this would make the total lines 5+2=7, but that's conflicting with my initial analysis.\n\nNow, this is a problem. Because my initial analysis thought of two lines in column2, but if the problem expects considering each maximal run as single, irrespective of how many pairs are present in it, then column2's three 🦂s would contribute only one line.\n\nSimilarly, in the rows, the runs are separate and so are counted individually.\n\nSo perhaps upon realizing that vertical runs should be considered as single if they are part of a continuous run beyond two, the total vertical lines would drop to 2, so total lines 5+2=7.\n\nSo which way is it?\n\nWell, perhaps the problem expects us to count each contiguous run of two or more in any direction as a single line, regardless of how many pairs are in longer runs.\n\nThus, in the column2, the three 🦂s would form a single line, of length 3, so contributing once.\n\nHence, the initial count vertical lines would be:\n\nColumn2:1, column3:1, columns0 and 1:0.\n\nSo vertical lines:2.\n\nThus, total lines:5+2=7.\n\nBut another point: the column2's vertical run starts at row1 and ends at row3—so it's a single line.\n\nSo then, the vertical count is 2.\n\nSo the total is 5+2=7.\n\nWait, but what about column2: The run from row1, which is 🐘? No, row0 is 🐘 and row1 is 🦂, so columns2 row0: 🐘, row1: 🦂—so they are different. So the vertical run for column2 is rows1-2: 🦂🦂🦂 (end at row3).\n\nWait, so column2 from row1 is 🦂, row2 is 🦂, row3 is 🦂. So it's a run of 3, so counted as a single vertical line.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nBut in this case, column2 contributes one vertical line.\n\nHence, the vertical counts are 2.\n\nSo total is 5+2=7.\n\nBut this contradicts the initial analysis, and I'm getting a bit stuck. So perhaps I should try a different approach.\n\nAnother way: For each cell in the grid, check how long the consecutive same emojis are to the right (for rows) and down (for columns), for each direction.\n\nEach time I find a consecutive run of length ≥2, I count it as one line, but I have to make sure not to recount runs already considered.\n\nWait, maybe I need to approach it line by line.\n\nIn rows:\n\nEach row is as follows:\n\nRow0: 🥀 🥀 🐘 🐘 → two runs: (0,0,🥀 length 2) and (0,2,🐘 length 2). So two lines.\n\nRow1: 🐘 🐘 🦂 🐆 → (1,0, 🐘 length 2). So one line.\n\nRow2: 🐆 🐆 🦂 🥀 → (2,0,🐆 length2). One line.\n\nRow3: 🥀 🦂 🦂 🥀 → (3,1, 🦂 length2). One line.\n\nSo total horizontal lines: 2+1+1+1=5.\n\nNow, for columns:\n\nEach column is as follows:\n\nColumn0:\n\nCells: row0:🥀, row1:🐘, row2:🐆, row3:🥀 → all different, no vertical lines.\n\nColumn1:\n\nCells: 🥀, 🐘, 🐆, 🦂 → all different, no lines.\n\nColumn2:\n\nCells: 🐘 (row0), 🦂 (row1), 🦂 (row2), 🦂 (row3). \n\nCheck vertically:\n\nLooking for runs:\n\nFrom row1, 🦂 in column2.\n\nCheck row2: same, so run from row1-2. Then row3 is same → run extends to row1-3 → so this is a single vertical run of 3 same ones. So this would count as one line.\n\nSo column2:1 vertical line.\n\nColumn3:\n\nCells: 🐘, 🐆, 🥀, 🥀.\n\nVertical lines here: rows2 and 3 are 🥀. So vertical line here: one, from row2 to row3.\n\nThus, column3:1.\n\nSo total vertical lines:1+1=2.\n\nThus, overall total lines:5 + 2 =7.\n\nAh, so after proper consideration, the correct count is 7, not 8.\n\nSo what was wrong earlier?\n\nEarlier, I thought column2 contributes two lines for rows1-2 and 2-3, treating them as separate lines, but according to problem's likely intent, it's a single line.\n\nThus, the correct answer is 7.\n\nWait, wait—since the initial analysis varies, I'm getting confused. Maybe another approach is better.\n\nLet's try to count for vertical lines in columns by looking for runs with length >=2.\n\nSo in column2:\n\nCheck each cell and see the maximum vertical run starting or passing through it.\n\nRow0: 🐘, can't form a line as row1's is 🦂. So no line.\n\nRow1: 🦂. Check cells below it. Row2 is 🦂 → so run from row1-2.\n\nCan extend to row3, which is also 🦂. So run is row1-3, length 3 → counts once.\n\nSo column 2 contributes 1 line.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow2: 🥀. Check row3: also 🥀 → line from row2-3, contributing 1.\n\nSo overall vertical lines: 2.\n\nSo the correct total is 5 (horizontal) +2 (vertical) =7.\n\nThis suggests that the answer is7.\n\nBut according to your initial analysis, some resources may solve the problem as 8. But given that long runs are single counts, perhaps the correct count is7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects that each pair in a longer run is a separate line.\n\nThis is unclear, but in some problem statements, each maximal run counts once, regardless of how long it is.\n\nThus, perhaps it's safer to proceed under this assumption.\n\nSo the correct answer is7.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the column2.\n\nColumn2: row1,2,3 all have 🦂s. So the vertical run is 3. So it's a single line.\n\nThus, vertical lines contribute 2.\n\nSo the final total is 5+2=7.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more on a 4x4 grid.

{"board":[["🦆","🦆","🦆","🔥"],["🔥","🦆","🦆","🦆"],["🔥","🦆","🦆","🦆"],["🦆","🐧","🔥","🦆"]],"response":["<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to solve this problem where I have to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines on a board made up of emojis. Each line must be formed by the same emoji and have a length of 2 or more. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the board they've given. The board is 4 rows by 4 columns since each row has four emojis. Let me write it down to make it clearer.\n\nRow 0: 🦆 🦆 🦆 🔥\nRow 1: 🔥 🦆 🦆 🦆\nRow 2: 🔥 🦆 🦆 🦆\nRow 3: 🦆 🐧 🔥 🦆\n\nWait, I probably should consider it as a grid, rows and columns starting from zero. Now, I need to check each row and column for consecutive same emojis. Each group of two or more is a line, but each line is counted once, right? Or, wait, no, I think each consecutive sequence counts as one line. So, for example, a row like three same emojis counts as one horizontal line.\n\nLet me tackle the rows first. I'll go through each row and check sequences.\n\nStarting with row 0: 🦆 🦆 🦆 🔥. So, the first three are ducks, then a fire. So that's three in a row. So that's one horizontal line of length 3.\n\nIn row 1: 🔥 🦆 🦆 🦆. Here, the last three are ducks. So that's another horizontal line of length 3.\n\nRow 2: 🔥 🦆 🦆 🦆. Same as row 1, three ducks in a row. So another line.\n\nRow 3: 🦆 🐧 🔥 🦆. Here, the ducks and chicken and fire and duck again. So no consecutive same emojis, so nothing here.\n\nSo horizontal lines: row 0 has one, rows 1 and 2 each have one. So that's 3 lines so far.\n\nNow checking vertical lines. I'll look at each column from top to bottom.\n\nColumn 0:\nRow0: 🦆\nRow1: 🔥\nRow2: 🔥\nRow3: 🦆\nSo looking for consecutive same emojis. Let's see:\n\nRow0 and row1: duck and fire—different. Row1 and 2: fire and fire same. So that's two in a row, a vertical line in column 0.\n\nRow2 and row3: fire and duck—different. So in column0, only one vertical line of length 2.\n\nColumn1:\nRow0: 🦆\nRow1: 🦆\nRow2: 🦆\nRow3: 🐧\n\nLooking from top to bottom. Let's check each position.\n\nCheck row0 to row1: duck same. Then row1 to row2: duck same. So that's a sequence of three ducks, making a vertical line of length 3. So that's one vertical line in column1, covering all three.\n\nBut wait, each vertical column is checked for consecutive same emojis. So, in column1, from row0 to row3, the ducks are in a vertical line except row3 which is a chicken. So row0,1,2 are ducks, so a line of length 3. So that counts as one line, not multiple lines (since it's all consecutive, it's just one line). So column1 contributes 1 vertical line.\n\nWait, but actually, all three are in a row, so the entire stretch is one line. Right. So that's one vertical line here.\n\nColumn 2:\nRow0: 🦆\nRow1: 🦆\nRow2: 🦆\nRow3: 🔥\n\nSame as column1. So rows 0,1,2 are ducks. So another line of length 3. So another vertical line.\n\nColumn3:\nRow0: 🔥\nRow1: 🦆\nRow2: 🦆\nRow3: 🦆\n\nLooking for consecutive. Let's see: row0 is fire, row1 is duck—different. Then row1 duck, row2 duck: same. So a line of length 2. Then row2 and row3 are duck—same. So from row1 to row2 to row3, that's three ducks, meaning a line of length 3—so one vertical line in column3.\n\nWait, let me think about column3 again. So entries are:\nRow0: 🔥\nRow1: 🦆\nRow2: 🦆\nRow3: 🦆\n\nLooking for vertical lines. So row1 duck, row2 duck: that's a line of length 2. Row2 and 3 ducks: same as before, but since row1,2,3 are all ducks, that's a single sequence of 3, so vertical line of 3. So column3 contributes 1 vertical line.\n\nSo for vertical lines: column0 has 1 (rows1 and 2, fire and fire), column1 has 1 (rows0-2, ducks), column2 has 1 (rows0-2, ducks), and column3 1 (rows1-3, ducks). So 4 vertical lines.\n\nWait wait, let's recount vertical lines:\n\nColumn0: rows1 and 2 are fire. So sequence of two: that's a vertical line of length 2. So one line.\n\nColumn1: rows0 to 2, which is three ducks, so one line.\n\nColumn2: same as column1.\n\nColumn3: rows1 to 3, three ducks, so one line.\n\nSo total vertical lines: 4.\n\nSo, vertical lines contribute 4, horizontal 3. So overall total is 7 lines.\n\nWait wait, but let me double-check each row and column because I might have missed something.\n\nHorizontal lines:\n\nRow0: three ducks. Counts as one line.\n\nRow1: three ducks, one line.\n\nRow2: three ducks, one line.\n\nRow3: no same emojis, so none.\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 3.\n\nVertical lines:\n\nColumn0: two fires in a row (rows1 and 2). One line.\n\nColumn1: three ducks, one line.\n\nColumn2: three ducks, one line.\n\nColumn3: three ducks, one line.\n\nTotal vertical lines: 4.\n\nSo overall, 3 +4=7.\n\nBut wait, looking again at vertical columns:\n\n- Column0: rows1 and 2 are the same. So that's a vertical line of length 2. Counts as one. Correct.\n\n- Column1: rows0-2, same. One line.\n\n- column2: rows0-2 same, one line.\n\n- column3: rows1-3 same, one line. So 4, that's correct.\n\nWait, what about row3? For vertical lines, it's only part of column3's line as the last row. So previously, I correctly tallied each column's vertical lines.\n\nHmm, is that all? Let me think—are there any other sequences? For example, is there a vertical line elsewhere?\n\nFor example, in column1:\n\nBetween rows1 and2 is aduck, same as row0. So column1 is all ducks except row3. So the line for column1 is rows0,1,2, making a vertical line of 3.\n\nSo that's one. Yes.\n\nSo that's 3 horizontal and 4 vertical, making 7.\n\nWait, but am I sure there's no other vertical or horizontal lines? Like, what about a shorter line within a longer run? For example, if there's 3 in a row, that's one line, but does that exclude a 2-length line within it? But no, the problem counts each consecutive group as one line, regardless of their length. Because each run of same emojis (with length >=2) counts once, regardless of how long. So a run of 3 would count as one line, same for a run of 4, etc.\n\nSo I think I'm confident that the count is 3 (horizontal) +4 (vertical) =7.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more on a 4x4 grid. Each consecutive sequence of the same emoji, regardless of its starting position, counts as one line.\n\n### Board Layout:\n```\nRow 0: 🦆 🦆 🦆 🔥\nRow 1: 🔥 🦆 🦆 🦆\nRow 2: 🔥 🦆 🦆 🦆\nRow 3: 🦆 🐧 🔥 🦆\n```\n\n###Horizontal Lines:\n- **Row 0**: The first three emojis (🦆, 🦆, 🦆) form one horizontal line of length 3.\n- **Row 1**: The last three emojis (🦆, 🦆, 🦆) form one horizontal line of length 3.\n- **Row 2**: The last three emojis (🦆, 🦆, 🦆) form one horizontal line of length 3.\n- **Row 3**: No consecutive emojis of the same type; no lines.\n\nTotal horizontal lines: **3**.\n\n###Vertical Lines:\n- **Column 0**: Rows 1 and 2 (🔥, 🔥) form one vertical line of length 2.\n- **Column 1**: Rows 0, 1, and 2 (🦆, 🦆, 🦆) form one vertical line of length 3.\n- **Column 2**: Rows 0, 1, and 2 (🦆, 🦆, 🦆) form one vertical line of length 3.\n- **Column 3**: Rows 1, 2, and 3 (🦆, 🦆, 🦆) form one vertical line of length 3.\n\nTotal vertical lines: **4**.\n\n###Final Count:\nAdding the horizontal and vertical lines gives us **3 + 4 = 7** lines.\n\nANSWER: 7"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nSo, the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines on a rectangular board made of emojis. Each line has to be formed by the same emoji and have a length of 2 or more. Then, I have to find the total count of such lines.\n\nThe given board is a 4x4 grid, with each cell containing an emoji. Let's visualize the board row by row as provided.\n\nFirst, I'll write down each row for clarity.\n\nRow 1: 🐐 🌒 🐐 💥\nRow 2: 💥 🌒 🌒 🌒\nRow 3: 💥 🐼 🐐 🌒\nRow 4: 💥 🐐 💥 🐼\n\nNow, I need to check both horizontally and vertically for lines of the same emoji that are at least length 2. So I should check each row for any runs and each column for any runs.\n\nI think the best approach is to process each row first, looking for consecutive same emojis, and then do the same for each column. For each run found (length >=2), I can count it as one line.\n\nLet me start with the horizontal lines.\n\nChecking each row:\n\nRow 1: 🐐, 🌒, 🐐, 💥\nLooking for same consecutive emojis. Each emoji is unique except between positions, but no two in a row are the same. So, no horizontal lines here.\n\nRow 2: 💥, 🌒, 🌒, 🌒\nHere, the last three are 🌒🌒🌒, which is a run of length 3. So that counts as a single line. Also, the first emoji is 💥, which doesn't form a run with the next.\n\nSo in row 2, there's 1 horizontal line of length 3.\n\nRow 3: 💥, 🐼, 🐐, 🌒\nAll different. No runs.\n\nRow 4: 💥, 🐐, 💥, 🐼\nAll different. No runs.\n\nSo in horizontal, we have 1 line.\n\nNow, let's check the vertical lines. For each column, check top to bottom for same emojis.\n\nColumns are from 0 to 3.\n\nColumn 0:\nRow1: 🐐\nRow2: 💥\nRow3: 💥\nRow4: 💥\nSo checking for runs:\n\nRow1 is 🐐. Not same as below. Next, row2: 💥... row3 is also 💥. So from row2 to row3: 2 of 💥. Then row4 is 💥. So we have a run of 3: row2 to row4. So that's one vertical line.\n\nBut wait, is it consecutive? Let me see:\n\nRow1: 🐐, then row2: 💥 (different), so that's a single element.\n\nRow2: 💥, row3: 💥 → same, so that's a run of 2 starting at row2, column0.\n\nThen, row3: 💥, row4: 💥 → so that's another same step. Combined, it's a run of 3. So in column0, how many lines? There's a run of 3, which counts as one line.\n\nSo column0 contributes 1 line.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow1: 🌒\n\nRow2: 🌒 → same.\n\nRow3: 🐼 → different.\n\nRow4: 🐐 → different.\n\nSo looking at column1 for consecutive same emojis.\n\nIn column1:\n\nRow1 and row2 (🌕 and 🌕) form a run of 2. So that's a vertical line.\n\nWhat about after that: row3 is 🐼, so no more. So 1 run here.\n\nSo column1 has 1 line.\n\nThen column2:\n\nRow1: 🐐\n\nRow2: �_gettime (but in the data, maybe I need to recount. Let's check again.\n\nWait, the four rows are:\n\nRow1: 🐐 🌒 🐐 💥 → so index 2 (third) is 🐐.\n\nRow2: 💥 🌒 🌒 � 얼마 (third is � sabah? Hopefully the original input was correct.

So each line represents one row of four emojis. So:\n\nRow1: 🐐, �etě, 🐐, 💥.\n\nNo, perhaps the accurate literal would be better. So the exact board is:\n\nRow 0 (given as the first line):\n\n🐐, �_defineas\/gif, 🐐, 💥\n\nWait, perhaps I should stop getting stuck and proceed, accepting that it's a little confusing but manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the actual emojis in each cell are as follows based on the user's description:\n\nRow 1 (0): 🐐, �ầng_finder, 🐐, 💥.\n\nI think maybe regardless of the exact emojis, I can proceed by considering that the emojis are as given.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck on the individual emojis, which is hindering me from processing their runs.\n\nWait perhaps the exact emojis don't matter as much as their sequence in each row and column.\n\nSo perhaps in the original board, I'll just assign arbitrary labels for each unique emoji.\n\nBut that might take time; perhaps it's better to process each row and column as per the emojis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can outline each cell's emoji as per the initial input.\n\nAlternatively, I can proceed step by step for each row and column.\n\nLet me work by rows:\n\nHorizontal lines:\n\nRow 0: 🐐 �enha 🐐 💥: so the sequence is A, B, A, C. No consecutive duplicates, so no lines.\n\nRow1: 💥 B B B → so B appears three times. So that's a run of 3, which is a horizontal line.\n\nRow2: 💥, C, A, B → all unique (C= maybe 🐼, A=🐐, B= � Yatırım). So no runs.\n\nRow3: 💥, A, 💥, C → All unique. No runs.\n\nSo horizontal lines: only row1 has a run of 3. So 1 line.\n\nNow for vertical lines:\n\nWe'll check each column, top to bottom.\n\nColumn0:\n\nCells: 🐐 (row0), 💥 (row1), 💥 (row2), 💥 (row3)\n\nSequence: A, D, D, D.\n\nSo after the first A, we have D in all lower cells. So consecutive D's start at row1, column0. So:\n\nRow1: D, then row2: D → that's two in a row, a run of 2. Plus row3 also D, so three in a row. So that's a vertical line of length 3.\n\nSo column0 has 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn1:\n\nCells: B (row0), B (row1), C (row2), A (row3).\n\nSo sequence: B, B, C, A. So the first two are B's → that's a run of 2. So yes, a vertical line.\n\nColumn1 has 1 line.\n\nColumn2:\n\nCells: A (row0), B (row1), A (row2), 💥 (row3).\n\nSequence: A, B, A, 💥 → no consecutive runs. So no lines in column2.\n\nWait A is some emoji, B is another, etc. So for column2:\n\nrow0: A, row1: B → different.\n\nrow1: B, row2: A → different.\n\nrow2: A and row3: = wait, row3, column2 is the fourth emoji in row3: row3 is 💥, A, 💥, C. So in column2, row3's emoji is the third element, which is 💥.\n\nWait, wait! Let me correct this. Because the rows are structured as four emojis each.\n\nSo for column2, which is the third emoji in each row.\n\nSo:\n\nRow0: [🐐, �адження, 🐐, 💥] → column2 (index2) is 🐐.\n\nRow1: [💥, �endance, �endance, �ancement] → column2 is �endance (assuming each is the same as the others).\n\nRow2: [💥, 🐼, 🐐, �endance] → column2 is 🐐.\n\nRow3: [💥, 🐐, 💥, 🐼] → column2 is 💥.\n\nSo column2 sequence is:\n\nrow0: 🐐\n\nrow1: �endance\n\nrow2: 🐐\n\nrow3: 💥\n\nSo checking column2: 🐐, �endance, 🐐, 💥 → no consecutive duplicates. So no vertical lines.\n\nColumn3:\n\nCells: row0 → 💥, row1 → �endance (same as row1's emojis?), row2 → �endance, row3 → 🐼.\n\nWait, row3, column3 (last cell) is 🐼.\n\nWait let me think:\n\nRow0: [ 🐐, �endance, 🐐, 💥] → column3 is 💥.\n\nRow1: [💥, �endance, �endance, �endance] → column3 is �endance.\n\nRow2: [💥, 🐼, 🐐, �endance] → column3 is �endance.\n\nRow3: [💥, 🐐, 💥, 🐼] → column3 is 🐼.\n\nSo column3 sequence:\n\nRow0: 💥, row1: �endance (same as �endance?), row2: �endance, row3: 🐼.\n\nSo:\n\nrow0: 💥.\n\nrow1: �endance.\n\nrow2: �endance → same as row1, so a run of 2.\n\nrow3: 🐼 → different.\n\nSo in column3, row1 and row2 form a run of 2. So that's another vertical line.\n\nSo column3 has 1 line.\n\nSo vertical lines so far: columns 0,1,3 each have one line → total 3.\n\nSo overall, from horizontal and vertical, we have 1 + 3 = 4 lines.\n\nWait, wait, let me double-check for vertical lines.\n\nColumn0: rows 1-3: all D (for example, suppose D is 💥). So that's a run of 3, which as a single line.\n\nColumn1: rows 0 and 1: both B (e.g., �endance), so a run of two → one line.\n\nColumn3: rows1 and 2: both �endance → one line.\n\nYes. So three vertical lines, one horizontal line. Total of 4 lines?\n\nWait, but earlier I thought column3 contributed a line. Let me recount.\n\nYes: column3 has a run of 2 (rows1 and 2). So count 1.\n\nAnd column0: run of 3 → count 1.\n\nColumn1: run of 2 → count 1.\n\nSo total vertical lines: 3, horizontal:1\n\nSo total lines: 4.\n\nWait, but while considering the runs, I might have missed some other runs.\n\nWait, in column0, rows1,2,3 are same → a single run of 3, which is just counted once. Not as multiple runs (like for a run of 3, it's one line, not considering lines of length 2 within it). The problem says 'lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more', but each run is considered as one line, regardless of how long. So for a run of three, it's counted once.\n\nSo, for column0: three in a row is one line. So correct.\n\nSimilarly, column1: two in a row, one line.\n\nColumn3: two in a row, one line.\n\nAdditionally, checking if I've considered all columns and rows.\n\nWait, what about other possible runs in vertical? Let's see:\n\nAnother approach is to think for each possible direction, any consecutive same emojis that are at least two in straight line, horizontal or vertical.\n\nSo, perhaps going back and checking for any runs I might have missed.\n\nLet me try:\n\nVERSION Let me detail each column and each row.\n\nHORIZONTAL:\n\nRow0: A, B, A, C → no runs.\n\nRow1: D, B, B, B → run from B_from哪里?\n\nRow1: cells are D, B, B, B → the last three B's. So the run is from column1 to column3: length 3. So one line.\n\nRow2: D, C, A, B → all unique.\n\nRow3: D, A, D, C → all unique.\n\nSo horizontal: 1 line.\n\nVERTICAL:\n\nColumn0: cells A, D, D, D → run from row1 to row3 (including all three), D's. So one line.\n\nColumn1: cells B, B, C, A → B's in row0 and row1 → run of 2. So one line.\n\nColumn2: cells A, B, A, D → row0, column2 is A; row1, it's B; row2, A; row3, D. No runs.\n\nColumn3: cells C, B, B, C → look at row0: C, row1: B, row1 and row2: B, B. So run of B's in row1 and row2 → that's two in a row.\n\nSo column3: one line.\n\nAlternatively, let me see column3's cells:\n\nRow0: C\n\nRow1: B\n\nRow2: B\n\nRow3: C\n\nSo in column3:\n\nRow1: B, row2: B → run of 2.\n\nSo that's one line.\n\nSo three vertical lines: columns 0,1,3.\n\nIn total, 3.\n\nSo all together, 1(horizontal) +3 (vertical) =4 lines.\n\nWait, but wait:\n\nWait in the initial column3, column3 for row3 is C (🐼). So yes, between row1 and row2, it's two B's.\n\nSo yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait now, I have to think if any vertical column has any other runs.\n\nLike in column2:\n\nrows0: A.\n\nrow1: B.\n\nrow2: A.\n\nrow3: →, say, D (💥).\n\nNo consecutive same emojis.\n\nWhat about row0 and row2 in column2: A's. But they're not consecutive, so that doesn't count.\n\nSo no runs in column2.\n\nSo yes, only three columns contribute lines.\n\nSo the total is 4 lines (1 horizontal, 3 vertical).\n\nBut let me double-check, perhaps elsewhere there's another line. Like in row2: D, C, A, B. All different, so nothing. Row3: D, A, D, C. Single D's around but not consecutive.\n\nWait, any vertical line I may have missed?\n\nIn column1, in row0 and row1, B's another in row2: C (row2, column1 is 🐼, different from B). So no.\n\nIn column0, rows 1,2,3 are same. So no other longer runs elsewhere.\n\nSo the total is 4.\n\nWait, but another part: is line considered only once per run, regardless of length.\n\nFor example, a run of 4 same in a line is counted once as a single line with length 4, not as two runs of two, etc.\n\nIn our case, the vertical column0 has three same, counted once.\n\nSo the solution is 4 lines.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines on a 4x4 board made up of emojis. Each line must be formed by the same emoji and have a length of 2 or more. \n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Horizontal Lines**:\n   - **Row 0**: `🐐, �.getLogger, 🐐, 💥`  \n     No consecutive emojis are the same.

{"board":[["🦏","⛅️","🌘","🦭"],["🦭","🦏","🌘","🦭"],["🌘","🦏","🌘","🌘"],["🦏","🦭","⛅️","🌘"]],"response":["<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, there's a 4x4 board made up of emojis, and I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines where the same emoji repeats two or more times in a row. The lines can be of length 2 or longer. Hmm, got it.\n\nFirst, I think I should write down the board to visualize it better. Let me see, each row is:\n\n1. 🦏, ⛅️, 🌘, 🦭\n2. 🦭, 🦏, 🌘, 🦭\n3. 🌘, 🦏, 🌘, 🌘\n4. 🦏, 🦭, ⛅️, 🌘\n\nWait, maybe numbering the rows from 1 to 4 and columns from 1 to 4 will help. Let me create a matrix. Oh wait, let me see what each row contains.\n\nSo, row 1: column 1 is rhino (🦏), then cloud (⛅️), moon (🌘), and another rhino 🦭—wait, no, 🦭 is actually a different animal, maybe a deer (I think) or something else, but for this purpose, different from 🦏.\n\nWait, maybe I should list each cell clearly.\n\nRow 1:\n1. 🦏\n2. ⛅️\n3. 🌘\n4. 🦭\n\nRow 2:\n1. 🦭\n2. 🦏\n3. 🌘\n4. 🦭\n\nRow 3:\n1. 🌘\n2. 🦏\n3. 🌘\n4. 🌘\n\nRow 4:\n1. 🦏\n2. 🦭\n3. ⛅️\n4. 🌘\n\nNow I need to check each row for horizontal lines. For each row, I'll check sequences of same emojis, in runs of two or more.\n\nLet's start with horizontal lines.\n\nRow 1: 🦏, ⛅️, 🌘, 🦭. All different except none. So no horizontal lines here.\n\nRow 2: 🦭, 🦏, 🌘, 🦭. First, 🦭, then 🦏 (different), then 🌘, then 🦭. All different, so no horizontal lines.\n\nRow 3: 🌘, 🦏, 🌘, 🌘. The last three are 🌘. So from columns 3-4 is a run of 2, but then column 3 is 🌘 and 4 is 🌘. So that's a line of 2. Then, in row 3, columns 2 is 🦏 which is alone. So in row 3, the last two cells are same. So that's a horizontal line of length 2. Also, column 3 and 4 same. So that's one line.\n\nWait, in row 3: cells are 🌘 (1), 🦏 (2), 🌘 (3), 🌘 (4). So positions 2 is surrounded by 🌘, 🦏, so no. So positions 3 and 4 are same. So horizontal line of 2, one occurrence.\n\nRow 4: 🦏, 🦭, ⛅️, 🌘. All different, no lines.\n\nSo for horizontal lines: only Row 3 contributes one line of two.\n\nNow check vertical lines. For each column, check each cell and the ones below for same emojis.\n\nLet's go column by column.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow 1: 🦏\nRow 2: 🦭\nRow 3: 🌘\nRow 4: 🦏\n\nLooking for vertical runs. So row 1 is 🦏, row 2 is 🦭—different. Row 3 is 🌘—different. Row 4 is 🦏, which is same as row 1 but not adjacent. So no vertical lines in column 1.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow 1: ⛅️\nRow 2: 🦏\nRow 3: 🦏\nRow 4: 🦭\n\nLet's check:\n\nRow 1: different from row 2.\n\nRow 2: 🦏. Row 3 is also 🦏, so this is a run of 2, a vertical line. So in column 2, rows 2 and 3 have same emojis, so that's a vertical line. Then, row 3 is 🦏, row 4 is 🦭—different. So column 2 has one vertical line: rows 2-3.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow 1: 🌘\nRow 2: 🌘\nRow 3: 🌘\nRow 4: ⛅️\n\nNow, let's check for consecutive same emojis.\n\nRow 1: 🌘, row 2: same. So that's a line starting from row 1 to row 2 (length 2). But then row 2 and 3 are same again. So how does that count? That's a run of three: rows 1-2-3. But for the problem, each line is at least two. So how many lines are in this column?\n\nEach possible run counts as a line. So the runs are:\n\nRow1-Row2: a run of 2.\n\nRow2-Row3: another run of 2. Additionally, Row1-Row2-Row3: a run of 3.\n\nSo how are they counted? Are runs of longer lengths counted once or as multiple lines? Because the same line can't form overlapping runs. Wait, the problem says to count each line formed by same emojis in a row. So for example, in a vertical column with 3 same emojis in a row, it's a single line of length 3. So in this case, column3 has a vertical line from row1 to row3 (one line of length 3). Additionally, if any separate runs exist elsewhere, they count too.\n\nWait, in column3: all three rows (1-3) are same. So it's one line of length 3. But also, row1-2 is a run, row2-3 is another run, but they're part of a larger run. So the question is whether longer runs are considered as a single line or whether each possible subrun is counted. The problem says, to count each line formed by the same emoji, with length 2 or more.\n\nWait, from the problem statement: lines are sequences of same emojis, each of which is a horizontal or vertical line. So a run of 3 in a row would be considered as a single line of length 3. But perhaps in this case, the line is considered as one, regardless of its length, as long as it's length >=2.\n\nWait wait no. No—that can't be. Let me re-read the problem statement:\n\n\"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\"\n\nSo each line is a single continuous run of same emojis. So, for example, in a column with a vertical run of 3 same emojis, it's considered as one line of length 3 (counts as 1). But in code, any continuous run for each possible starting point, and any length >=2. Wait no, each entire continuous run is a single line. So for column3, rows 1-3 form one line of length 3. So that's one count.\n\nSo in column3:\n\nOnly one vertical line of length 3.\n\nBut wait, the column is four rows. Let's describe it more clearly. Column3 has:\n\nRow1: 🌘\n\nRow2: 🌘\n\nRow3: 🌘\n\nRow4: ⛅️ (different)\n\nSo rows 1-3 same, row4 different. So that's a vertical line from row1 to row3, length 3. So that's one line.\n\nBut is that the only one? Or, are other lines present? For instance, between rows1-2 and 2-3, but that's part of the same longer run, so they don't count as separate.\n\nAlternatively, is a vertical line allowed at any point, even if it's part of a longer run? For example, if a run is length 4, how many lines? Like, how many lines does 🌘🌘🌘🌘 form? It's a single run, so one line of length 4.\n\nSo back to column3: in this case, it's a single line.\n\nThen, column4.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow1: 🦭\n\nRow2: 🦭\n\nRow3: 🌘\n\nRow4: 🌘\n\nSo, checking:\n\nRows 1 and 2: both 🦭. So that's a vertical line of length 2.\n\nRows3 and4: both 🌘. Another vertical line of length 2.\n\nSo in column4, there are two vertical lines: one from row1-2, another from row3-4.\n\nSo let me sum vertical lines:\n\nColumn1: none.\n\nColumn2: rows2-3, one line.\n\nColumn3: one line (rows1-3).\n\nColumn4: two lines (rows1-2 and 3-4).\n\nSo total vertical lines: 1+1+1+2 → 5? Wait wait wait, no, because the counts per column:\n\nWait, column2 adds 1.\n\nColumn3 adds 1.\n\nColumn4 adds 2.\n\nSo vertical lines: 1+1+2 = 4.\n\nWait, no—the way we calculated earlier seems different. Because column3 adds 1, column2 adds 1, column4 adds 2.\n\nHmm, 1+1+2=4 vertical lines.\n\nWait my earlier momentary calculation perhaps was adding 1 (col2) + 1 (col3) + 2 (col4) equals 4 vertical lines.\n\nWait, column2's run is row2-3, length 2 → 1.\n\nColumn3's run is row1-3 → 1.\n\nColumn4's runs: two instances, rows1-2 🦭 and 3-4 🌘 → two lines.\n\nSo vertical totals are 1+1+2=4.\n\nNow, the horizontal lines.\n\nEarlier, I found only row3 has a horizontal line: cells3-4 (length 2), so 1 line.\n\nSo adding horizontal and vertical lines: 1 +4=5.\n\nWait, but I should reevaluate the vertical lines.\n\nWait, let's recheck each column.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRows1-4: 🦏, 🦭, 🌘, 🦏.\n\nNo consecutive same emojis. So no lines.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRows1: ⛅️. Different from row2 (🦏).\n\nRow2: 🦏.\n\nDoes row2 and row3 both have 🦏? Yes.\n\nSo row2-3: vertical line of 2.\n\nRow3: 🦏, row4: 🦭. Different. So only one line in column2.\n\nColumn3:\n\nAll three rows (1-3) have 🌘, as we determined. So a vertical line of 3 cells. So one line.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow1: 🦭, row2: 🦭. Same. So that's a line of 2.\n\nRow3: 🌘, row4: 🌘. Same. Another line of 2.\n\nSo column4 has two lines.\n\nSo vertical lines total: 1 (col2) + 1 (col3) + 2 (col4) → 4.\n\nHorizontal lines: row3, cell3-4 → one.\n\nSo overall total is 4+1=5.\n\nWait, but wait—horizontal lines: perhaps I missed some.\n\nLet me recheck the rows:\n\nRow1: all different. So nothing.\n\nRow2: cells are 🦭, 🦏, 🌘, 🦭. Are any same? Let's see cell1: 🦭, cell4: 🦭. But cell2 is 🦏, so in row2, any two same? No, because cells1 is 🦭, cell2 is 🦏, which is different. Then cell3 is 🌘, cell4 is 🦭. So no sequence.\n\nWait row2: cells1 to4: 🦭, 🦏, 🌘, 🦭. So no consecutive same except cell4 is same as cell1 but not adjacent.\n\nIn row2, any horizontal line? No.\n\nRow3: 🌘, 🦏, 🌘, 🌘. So cells3 and4 are same (🌘). So that's a horizontal line of 2. Also, cell3 is same as cell4. So that's one.\n\nAre there any others in any row? Let's check row4: 🦏, 🦭, ⛅️, 🌘. all different, so nothing.\n\nWait, what about row3, cells2 is 🦏. The cells before and after are different. So only the last two.\n\nSo rows only add one horizontal line.\n\nSo total lines: 5.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Another approach: for each cell, check right and down (for horizontal and vertical lines respectively) to see if same emoji occurs in adjacent cells, but careful to not double-count.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another way to approach is to process each possible direction and check the maximum possible runs.\n\nWait, maybe I should proceed more systematically.\n\nFor horizontal runs:\n\nCheck each row:\n\nRow1: 🦏, ⛅, 🌘, 🦭 → no runs.\n\nRow2: 🦭, 🦏, 🌘, 🦭 → no consecutive runs.\n\nRow3: 🌘, 🦏, 🌘, 🌘 → at positions 3-4 → run of 2 → count 1.\n\nRow4: 🦏, 🦭, ⛅, 🌘 → no runs.\n\nSo horizontal: 1.\n\nFor vertical runs:\n\nCheck each column:\n\nColumn1: 🦏, 🦭, 🌘, 🦏 → no runs.\n\nColumn2: ⛅, 🦏, 🦏, 🦭 → rows2-3 same→run of 2 → 1.\n\nColumn3: 🌘, 🌘, 🌘, ⛅→ run of 3 →1.\n\nColumn4:\n\n- positions 1-2: 🦭 same → run of 2 →1.\n\n- positions3-4: 🌘 same → run of 2 →1.\n\nSo in column4, two runs.\n\nTotal vertical: column2(1) + column3(1) + column4(2) = 4.\n\nTotal overall: 1+4=5.\n\nIs that correct? Let me see.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.

{"board":[["🌻","😁","🌻","😁"],["🌻","🌻","🌻","😁"],["😁","🌻","🌻","🦦"],["🦦","🌻","😁","😁"]],"response":["<think>\nOkay, so I've got this problem where I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines on a board made up of emojis. Each line should consist of the same emoji and have a length of at least 2. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the board as provided. It's a 4-row by 4-column grid. Each cell has an emoji, and lines can be either horizontal or vertical. Maybe I can visualize it or even sketch it out to make it easier.\n\nLet me write down the board to see it clearly:\n\nRow 1: 🌻 😁 🌻 😁\nRow 2: 🌻 🌻 🌻 😁\nRow 3: 😁 🌻 🌻 🦦\nRow 4: 🦦 🌻 😁 😁\n\nHmm, wait, maybe I should index the rows from top to bottom as rows 1 to 4 and columns from left to right as 1 to 4. So each cell has a position (row, column).\n\nI think the approach is to check for consecutive same emojis in each row (horizontally) and each column (vertically), counting the lines that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's tackle horizontal lines first. I'll go through each row and see if there are sequences of 2 or more same emojis.\n\nStarting with Row 1:\n- Columns 1-2: 🌻 and 😁—different, so no line.\n- Columns 2-3: 😁 and 🌻—different.\n- Columns 3-4: 🌻 and 😁—different.\nSo Row 1 has no horizontal lines.\n\nRow 2:\n- It's 🌻 🌻 🌻 😁.\nCheck for consecutive same emojis:\n- Columns 1-3: 🌻 🌻 🌻—this is a line of length 3. So that's one line. Also, within this, there are lines of length 2. Since the problem asks for the count of lines with length >=2, but how do we count them? Wait, the problem says \"number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So each continuous segment counts as one line. So in row 2, the three 🌻s form a single line of length 3.\n\nSo in row 2, horizontal lines: 1.\n\nRow 3: 😁 🌻 🌻 🦦\nLooking for consecutive same:\n- Column 2-3: 🌻 🌻 → that's a line of length 2. So one line here.\n\nRow 4: 🦦 🌻 😁 😁\n- Columns 3-4: 😁 😁 → another line of length 2. So one line here.\n\nSo total horizontal lines are 1 (row2) + 1 (row3) + 1 (row4) = 3.\n\nWait, wait, I think I might have a confusion here. Let me clarify: when checking for horizontal lines, each run of same emojis counts as a single line if its length is >=2, regardless of how long it is. So for example, in row 2, the three 🌻s form a single line, not multiple lines of 2. Because each contiguous block is one line. So even though you can have two lines of 2 within the 3, it's still just one line of length 3. Because the problem counts each contiguous line once, regardless of its length as long as it's >=2.\n\nGot it. So for each row, check for runs (consecutive same emojis) of length >=2. Each such run is counted once.\n\nSo with that in mind:\n\nRow 1:\nNo runs. So 0.\n\nRow 2: one run of 3 → count 1.\n\nRow3: run of 2 in columns 2-3 → count 1.\n\nRow4: run of 2 in columns 3-4 → count 1.\n\nTotal horizontal: 1+1+1=3.\n\nNow for vertical lines: same approach, but column-wise.\n\nI'll go column by column, checking each for consecutive same emojis in the vertical direction.\n\nTotal columns:4.\n\nChecking each column for runs.\n\nColumn1:\nRow1: 🌻\nRow2: 🌻\nRow3: 😁\nRow4: 🦦\n\nCheck for consecutive in rows:\n\nBetween row1 and row2: 🌻 and 🌻, so two in a row. So that's a vertical line of length 2. Now, are there more? Let's see:\n\nrow2 to row3: 🌻 to 😁—different. So column1 has one vertical line.\n\nIs there any other line in column1? Let's see the entire column: 🌻, 🌻, 😁, 🦦.\n\nOnly the first two (row1 and row2) are same. No other consecutive.\n\nColumn1:1 vertical line.\n\nColumn2:\nRows:\nRow1: 😁\nRow2: 🌻\nRow3: 🌻\nRow4: 🌻\n\nLooking for vertical runs:\n\nRow3: 🌻, row4: 🌻 → that's a run of 2, starting at row3. But what about row2-row3: 🌻 and 🌻. So rows 2,3,4 are 🌻,🌻,🌻. Wait:\n\nWait, in column 2:\n\nRow2 is 🌻, row3 is 🌻, row4 is 🌻—so three in a row. So that's a single vertical line of length 3.\n\nWait, that's right. So in column 2, rows 2-4 are all 🌻, making one vertical line.\n\nAnother way: From row2 to row3 and row3 to row4, but all together, it's a single contiguous line.\n\nSo column 2 contributes one vertical line.\n\nColumn3:\nRows:\nRow1: 🌻\nRow2: 🌻\nRow3: 🌻\nRow4: 😁\n\nCheck for consecutive same:\n\nRow1: 🌻, row2: 🌻 → run of 2.\n\nRow2: 🌻, row3: 🌻 → that adds to the run, so together it's is a run of 3 (row1-2-3) → but row4 is different.\n\nSo column3 has one line of 3. So one vertical line here.\n\nWait no:\n\nWait, let's be precise.\n\nIn column3:\n\nrow1: 🌻\nrow2: 🌻\nrow3: 🌻\nrow4: 😁\n\nRun from row1 to row3: 3 consecutive same emojis. So this is a single line of length 3. So one vertical line in column3.\n\nNow column4:\n\nRows:\nRow1: 😁\nRow2: 😁\nRow3: 🦦\nRow4: 😁\n\nLooking for runs:\n\nBetween row1 and row2: 😁 😁 → run of 2.\n\nBetween row3 and row4: 🦦 and 😁 → different.\n\nAre there overlaps or longer runs?\n\nNo, because after row2, row3 is different. So column4 has one vertical line.\n\nSo in column4, one vertical line.\n\nSo vertical lines count: column1:1, column2:1, column3:1, column4:1 → total of 4.\n\nWait, wait, I think I need to recount.\n\nWait:\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow2: 🌻, row3: 🌻, row4: 🌻 → vertical line length 3. So that's one line.\n\nColumn1: rows 1 and 2: two in a row → one line.\n\nColumn3: rows 1-3: three in a row → one line.\n\nColumn4: rows 1-2: two in a row → one line.\n\nSo vertical lines total 4.\n\nSo adding to the horizontal count, which was 3.\n\nTotal lines: 3 horizontal + 4 vertical = 7.\n\nWait. That adds up to 7.\n\nBut let me cross-verify. Is that all the possible lines? Did I maybe miss something?\n\nLet me think again, checking row by row and column by column.\n\nHorizontal:\n\nRow2: from column1 to column3: 🌻🌻🌻 → one line.\n\nRow3: columns2-3: 🌻🌻 → one line.\n\nRow4: columns3-4: 😁😁 → one line.\n\nSo 3.\n\nVertical:\n\nColumn1: rows1-2 → two → one line.\n\nColumn2: rows2-4 → three → one line.\n\nColumn3: rows1-3 → three→ one line.\n\nColumn4: rows1-2 → two → one line.\n\nSo 4.\n\nYes, 3+4=7.\n\nWait a second, in column2, there's a vertical line from row2 to row4 (3 in a row). That's one line.\n\nYes, that counts correctly.\n\nIs there any other vertical line in any column? Like, for example, in column3, rows 2-3-4: no, because row4 is 😁.\n\nHmm. So I think that's correct. So the answer should be 7.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more on a given 4x4 board. \n\n### Approach:\n1. **Horizontal Lines**: Check each row for contiguous segments of the same emoji with a length of 2 or more.

So the task is to find the number of horizontal or vertical lines where the same emoji repeats two or more times. Each line can be of any length as long as it's at least two, and we have to count each of them regardless of their length. \n\nLet me see the board given:\n\nThe board is a 4x4 grid. Each row is as follows:\n\n1st row: 🦖, 🐫, 🐼, 🐼\n2nd row: 🐼, 🐺, 🐺, 🐼\n3rd row: 🐫, 🐺, 🐼, 🦖\n4th row: 🐼, 🐫, 🦖, 🐺\n\nI think I'll need to check each row and column to find consecutive same emojis. Maybe I should start by going through each row first.\n\nLet's look at each row for horizontal lines.\n\n1st row:\n🦖, 🐫, 🐼, 🐼\nI notice that the last two are 🐼s. So that's a line of length 2. So that's one line.\n\n2nd row:\n🐼, 🐺, 🐺, 🐼\nHere, the middle two are 🐺, each repeated. So that's another line of length 2. So add one.\n\n3rd row:\n🐫, 🐺, 🐼, 🦖\nNo consecutive duplicates in this row. So nothing here.\n\n4th row:\n🐼, 🐫, 🦖, 🐺\nAgain, no consecutive duplicates. So no lines here.\n\nSo that's two horizontal lines.\n\nNow, checking the columns for vertical lines. Each column has four elements from each row.\n\nLet me list the columns as per their positions.\n\nColumn 1: 🦖, 🐼, 🐫, 🐼\nLooking for consecutive duplicates. The first is 🦖, then 🐼, no match. Next is 🐫 and then 🐼. No duplicates. So no lines here.\n\nColumn 2: 🐫, 🐺, 🐺, 🐫\nLet's see:\n- Row1: 🐫, row2: 🐺 → different.\n- row2: 🐺, row3: 🐺 → same! So two in a row. That's a line. So that's one line.\n- Now, after that, row3 to row4: 🐺 vs 🐫? No match. So only one vertical line here.\n\nColumn 3: 🐼, 🐺, 🐼, 🦖\nLet me see each pair:\n- row1 to row2: 🐼→🐺 → no.\n- row2 to row3: 🐺→🐼 → no.\n- row3 to row4: 🐼→🦖 → no.\nSo nothing here.\n\nWait, wait, did I get that right? Maybe I should number each row.\n\nColumn 3 details:\nRow1: 🐼\nRow2: 🐺\nRow3: 🐼\nRow4: 🦖\n\nEach adjacent pair is different, so no vertical lines here.\n\nColumn 4: 🐼, 🐼, 🦖, 🐺\nChecking each pair:\n- row1 🐼, row2 🐼 → same, so line of length 2. So that's one line.\n- Also, after that, row2 to row3: 🐼→🦖 → no.\n- And row3 to row4: 🦖→🐺 → no.\nSo column4 gives one vertical line in the first two rows.\n\nWait, but when we have a longer line, like three same in a column, would that count as two lines or one?\n\nWait, the problem statement says lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more. So a line of 3 in a row counts as how many lines?\n\nHmm, think about this. For example, if three same emojis are in a line vertically. That would have two possible line segments: one from row1-row2, and another from row2-row3. Or do longer lines count as a single line each?\n\nWell, the problem says \"count ... lines formed by same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So each instance where 2 or more same are consecutive. Even if they're part of a longer run, each pair counts as a line? Or each distinct maximal line?\n\nWait the problem clarifies, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by same emoji, with length 2 or more. Which I think refers to each maximal line, meaning a straight run as long as possible.\n\nWait, example: a row with four same emojis would count as one line of length 4, because it's a single continuous line. So we only count each distinct maximal run as one line, whether it's length 2, 3, etc. \n\nBecause otherwise, for three same in a row, you could say there are two lines: the first two and the last two, but that's not how the problem is intended. I think each maximal run of two or more is one line, regardless of its length beyond two.\n\nBecause otherwise, each longer line would be counted multiple times, which the problem might not want. So I'll proceed under the assumption that each continuous run of same emoji in a row or column is counted once, even if longer than two.\n\nWait but wait, the given sample may clarify that.\n\nWait, the initial problem gives us a board, but it's the one I should analyze. So perhaps in looking back at the board, maybe the columns have runs longer than two?\n\nWait, the sample board is:\n\nLooking at column 4:\n\nRow1: 🐼\n\nRow2: 🐼\n\nRow3: 🦖\n\nRow4: 🐺\n\nSo rows 1 and 2 are 🐼 in column4, making a run of two. So that's one vertical line.\n\nEarlier, column2 had a run of two 🐺 in rows 2 and 3, making one vertical line.\n\nMoving on.\n\nWait, to make sure: any column runs? Let me re-examine all four columns.\n\nWait, column1:\n\nRow1: 🦖\n\nRow2: 🐼\n\nRow3: 🐫\n\nRow4: 🐼\n\nNo consecutive duplicates so no lines.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow1: 🐫\n\nRow2: 🐺\n\nRow3: 🐺 (same as row2)\n\nRow4: 🐫\n\nSo between row2 and row3, we have two 🐺s — that's one line.\n\nColumn2 contributes one vertical line.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow1 and row2 are 🐼— one line.\n\nSo in vertical, we have column 2 (row2-3) and column4 (rows1-2), so two vertical lines.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought so, no— that's two vertical lines.\n\nSo now, in total:\n\nIn horizontal, I found rows 1 and 2 each contributing one line. So that's 2.\n\nIn vertical, I found two lines — column 2 and column4 each having a run of two. So that's 2.\n\nSo 2 +2 = 4 lines total.\n\nWait, but wait— what about any longer lines in either direction? Because in the rows, no longer than two.\n\nWait Row2, horizontal line: 🐺, 🐺 is a run of 2.\n\nWait no more.\n\nSo in horizontal lines: 2.\n\nIn vertical: 2.\n\nTotal: 4.\n\nWait but wait, let me recount.\n\nWait in the columns: Column 2 has a run, and column 4 has a run. So that's 2.\n\nIn the rows, row1 has a run, row2 has a run. That's 2.\n\nSo total 4.\n\nBut wait, wait— let me check each direction.\n\nWait, row1 is: 🦖 🐫 🐼 🐼 → so the last two are 🐼s: this is one line.\n\nRow2: 🐼 🐺 🐺 🐼 → two 🐺s in middle, that's another line.\n\nRows3: nothing. Rows4: no.\n\nSo in rows, there's 2.\n\nNow, columns.\n\nColumn 1: no runs.\n\nColumn2: rows 2 and 3: 🐺 🐺 → that's one line.\n\nColumn3: nothing.\n\nColumn4: rows1 and 2: 🐼 🐼 → one line.\n\nSo column lines total 2.\n\nThus, total lines: 2 + 2 =4.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me look for any other possibilities.\n\nIs there any column where the run is longer than two, but I'm not counting multiple lines? No— because each run is counted as a single line regardless of length.\n\nSo the answer is 4 lines.\n\nWait a moment, is that correct?\n\nWait, maybe I should check each row and column again.\n\nRows:\n\nRow 1: line between positions 3 and 4 (2 🐼s) → one line.\n\nRow 2: between 2 and3 (2 🐺s) → one line.\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 2.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn2: rows 2-3 (2 🐺s) → one line.\n\nColumn4: rows1-2 (2 🐼s) → one line.\n\nSo vertical lines: 2.\n\nTotal 4 lines.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines on a 4x4 emoji board where the same emoji appears consecutively two or more times. Each maximal continuous run of identical emojis is counted as a single line.\n\n### Analysis of the Board\n\nThe given board is as follows:\n\n1. **Row 1**: 🦖, 🐫, 🐼, 🐼  \n   - Horizontal line: A run of 2 🐼s at the end.

The lines have to be at least length 2. The board is 4x4, filled with different emojis. Let me take a look.\n\nFirst, I'll try to visualize the board row by row. Let me write them down as they are:\n\nRow 0: 🌊, 🦞, 🐛, 🌊\nRow 1: 🦞, 🦞, 🌊, 🌙\nRow 2: 🌊, 🦞, 🌊, 🦞\nRow 3: 🌙, 🦞, 🌊, 🌊\n\nWait, are these rows numbered correctly? Let's make sure. The first line is row 0, next row 1, 2, 3. Yeah, that's right.\n\nNow, I need to analyze each row for horizontal lines and each column for vertical lines. Let me break it down.\n\nStarting with horizontal lines. I'll check each row to see if there are two or more consecutive same emojis.\n\nRow 0: 🌊, then 🦞, then 🐛, then 🌊. There's 🌊 at start and end, but they're not consecutive. The middle elements are all different. So no horizontal lines here.\n\nRow 1: 🦞, 🦞, then 🌊, then 🌙. The first two are 🦞, so that's a line of length 2. Then the next is 🌊, which is different. So that's one horizontal line in row 1.\n\nRow 2: 🌊, 🦞, 🌊, 🦞. All alternating, so nothing longer than 1 in a row. So no lines here.\n\nRow 3: 🌙, 🦞, 🌊, 🌊. Wait, the last two are 🌊. So that's a line of length 2. So that's another horizontal line.\n\nSo for horizontal lines, total is 2 from rows 1 and 3.\n\nNow for vertical lines. I'll have to check each column top to bottom. There are four columns.\n\nColumn 0: Elements from top to bottom are 🌊 (row0), 🦞(row1), 🌊(row2), 🌙(row3). Are any three or more the same? Let me see. Row0: 🌊, row1: 🦞 (different), so no. Only two in row 0 and 2, but they are not consecutive in vertical. Wait, no, because each is in a different row. So, vertically consecutive? Like row0 col0: 🌊, row1 same column: 🦞 — that's different. So no two same vertically consecutive in column 0. So no vertical lines here.\n\nWait, not quite. Because maybe more? Let me re-express the column as a single list.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about each group of same emojis in the same column, looking for runs of two or more. Oh wait, but wait, in vertical, a line is consecutive same emojis, but in rows below each other.\n\nFor example, column 0:\n\nRow0: 🌊\n\nRow1: 🦞\n\nRow2: 🌊\n\nRow3: 🌙\n\nSo between row0 and row1, no same, so no line. Similarly, row1 and row2: 🦞 and 🌊: different. Row2 to row3: different. So in column 0, no vertical lines.\n\nNow column 1:\n\nRow0: 🦞\n\nRow1: 🦞\n\nRow2: 🦞\n\nRow3: 🦞\n\nWait, all same emojis? Let me check: \n\nNo. Wait:\n\nRow0: 🦞 (yes)\nRow1: 🦞\nRow2: 🦞\nRow3: 🦞.\n\nSo all four are the same. That's a vertical line of length 4. So that's definitely a line we count.\n\nWait, does each run of length exactly 2 or more get counted each as a line? For example, in column1, are there multiple lines? Or is it just considered as a single line for the length of 4.\n\nWait, the problem says \"number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So each such run of 2 or more counts as one line. So even if a column has a run of four same emojis, it's just considered as a single line.\n\nWait, but what about if in a column: say, emojis are A, A, A, A. Then the vertical line is from row0 to row3 — a single line of length 4. So only one line.\n\nYes. So in column1, each row has 🦞, so the line is from row0 to row3, all same. So that counts as one vertical line of length 4.\n\nNow the question is: do we count each consecutive run of 2 or more as individual lines if a column has multiple such runs? Wait, that's not possible in vertical because it's column based, but maybe depends on the data. For example, if a column has A, A, B, A, A — that would have runs of 2, then 2 again later. But in this scenario, that's not happening.\n\nIn our current case, column1: runs 4 in a row, which is just one single line.\n\nSo column1 contributes 1 vertical line.\n\nMoving on to column2:\n\nElements:\n\nRow0: 🐛\n\nRow1: 🌊\n\nRow2: 🌊\n\nRow3: 🌊\n\nSo in column2:\n\n- Row1 is 🌊, row2 is 🌊, row3 is 🌊: three in a row. So that's a vertical line of 3. So it counts as 1 line.\n\nAdditionally, are there multiple runs? Let's see: row0 is 🐛, which is different from row1 (🌊), so no line there. Only the last three rows in column2 have a run of 3. So that adds another vertical line.\n\nWait, wait, but in column2, row1 has 🌊, row2 has 🌊, row3 has 🌊. So three consecutive, same emojis. So that's a run of length 3. So that counts as 1 vertical line.\n\nSo column2: vertical line count is 1.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🌊\n\nRow1: 🌙\n\nRow2: 🦞\n\nRow3: 🌊, 🌊\n\nWait, no. Let me get column3 details:\n\nRow0: 🌊\n\nRow1: 🌙\n\nRow2: 🦞\n\nRow3: 🌊\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me check the board again.\n\nWait, the initial problem statement:\n\nboard:\n\n🌊🦞🐛🌊\n\n🦞🦞🌊🌙\n\n🌊🦞🌊🦞\n\n🌙🦞🌊🌊\n\nWait, I think I may have messed up the columns before.\n\nLet me write it correctly as four columns, each with four rows.\n\nBreaking it down row by row:\n\nRow 0: 🌊, 🦞, 🐛, 🌊 → columns 0-3.\n\nRow 1: 🦞, 🦞, 🌊, 🌙 → columns 0=🦞, 1=🦞, 2=🌊, 3=🌙.\n\nRow2: 🌊, 🦞, 🌊, 🦞 → columns 0=🌊, 1=🦞, 2=🌊, 3=🦞.\n\nRow3: 🌙, 🦞, 🌊, 🌊 → columns 0=🌙, 1=🦞, 2=🌊, 3=🌊.\n\nSo column3:\n\nRow0: 🌊\n\nRow1: 🌙\n\nRow2: 🦞\n\nRow3: 🌊\n\nSo column3: row0 is 🌊, row1 is 🌙. No matching. Row2 is 🦞, row3 is 🌊. So row0 > row1: no same. Row1 and row2: 🌙 vs 🦞: no. Row2 to row3: 🦞 vs 🌊: no. So column3 has no vertical lines.\n\nWait, but wait. The third row (row3) has 🌊, but only once. So column3 has no consecutive same emojis in any part.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something? Let me look again.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🌊\nRow1: 🌙\nRow2: 🦞\nRow3: 🌊\n\nSo no two in a row in column3. So no vertical lines here.\n\nSo, summarizing vertical lines:\n\n- Column0: none.\n- Column1: four in a row → 1 line.\n- Column2: three in a row (rows1-3) → 1 line.\n- Column3: none.\n\nVertical lines total: 2.\n\nSo earlier, horizontal lines had 2, vertical have 2, total of 4.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nHorizontal lines:\n\n- Row1 has two 🦞s ⇒ count 1.\n- Row3 has two 🌊s ⇒ count 1.\n\nSo total 2.\n\nVertical lines:\n\n- Column1: rows0-3 have four 🦞s → count 1 (albeit length 4).\n- Column2: rows1-3 have three 🌊 → count 1.\n\nIs that correct? Oh wait, column2 row1 is 🌊, row2 is 🌊, row3 is 🌊: three in a row, starting at row1, length 3. So that's one line.\n\nSo vertical lines total should be 2.\n\nWait, but column1 has four in a row, but it's counted once. So yeah.\n\nSo overall: 2 (horizontal) + 2 (vertical) = 4 total lines.\n\nWait, but earlier, I didn't consider any other possibilities. Let me make sure I didn't miss any.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check each row again.\n\nFor horizontal:\n\nRow0: 🌊 🦞 🐛 🌊 → all single, no lines.\n\nRow1: 🦞 🦞 🌊 🌙 → line of 2.\n\nRow2: 🌊 🦞 🌊 🦞 → all single.\n\nRow3: 🌙 🦞 🌊 🌊 → line of 2.\n\nSo 2 horizontal lines.\n\nFor vertical:\n\nCheck each column again. Column0: 🌊, 🦞, 🌊, 🌙 → all different except row0 and row2, but they are not consecutive.\n\nColumn1: 🦞, 🦞, 🦞, 🦞 → all same, counts as 1 line.\n\nColumn2: 🐛, 🌊, 🌊, 🌊. So in column2, row1 is 🌊, row2 is 🌊, row3 is 🌊 → length 3 → 1 line.\n\nColumn3: 🌊, 🌙, 🦞, 🌊 → all are alone, no lines.\n\nAlso, are there any lines I'm missing elsewhere?\n\nAnother way is to think of each direction:\n\nFor vertical, in each column, check for consecutive same emojis of length >=2.\n\nSo column0:\n\nRow0: 🌊, row1: 🦞 → nope.\n\nRow1: 🦞, row2: 🌊 → no.\n\nRow2: 🌊, row3: 🌙 → no.\n\nSo nothing.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow0: 🦞, row1: 🦞 → yes, that's a run of at least 2. But since the rest are same, it's one run.\n\nSo in column1, it's considered a single line.\n\nSimilarly, column2: only three in row1-3. So an addition.\n\nIs there any other way this could happen? Let me think.\n\nEach group of identical consecutive (vertically or horizontally) should be considered.\n\nNow, is there any possibility that a column has multiple separate vertical lines? Like, in a column, two separate runs of same emoji? Like, [A,A,B,B], with two runs. For a 4-row column:\n\nBut in our dataset, no such case.\n\nAdditionally, horizontal: are there any longer or any other runs?\n\nNo, in horizontal only two runs: row1 two 🦞, row3 two 🌊.\n\nSo I think the total is 4.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is 4.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji on a 4x4 board, where each line has a length of 2 or more. Here is the board:\n\n```\n🌊🦞🐛🌊\n🦞🦞🌊🌙\n🌊🦞🌊🦞\n🌙🦞🌊🌊\n```\n\n### Horizontal Lines\n- **Row 0**: 🌊, 🦞, 🐛, 🌊 → No consecutive emojis, so no lines.\n- **Row 1**: 🦞, 🦞, 🌊, 🌙 → Two consecutive 🦞s, so 1 line.\n- **Row 2**: 🌊, 🦞, 🌊, 🦞 → No consecutive emojis, so no lines.\n- **Row 3**: 🌙, 🦞, 🌊, 🌊 → Two consecutive 🌊s, so 1 line.\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 2.\n\n### Vertical Lines\n- **Column 0**: 🌊, 🦞, 🌊, 🌙 → No consecutive emojis, so no lines.\n- **Column 1**: 🦞, 🦞, 🦞, 🦞 → Four consecutive 🦞s, so 1 line.\n- **Column 2**: 🐛, 🌊, 🌊, 🌊 → Three consecutive 🌊s, so 1 line.\n- **Column 3**: 🌊, 🌙, 🦞, 🌊 → No consecutive emojis, so no lines.\n\nTotal vertical lines: 2.\n\n### Total Count\nAdding the horizontal and vertical lines together, we get a total of 4 lines.\n\n**Answer: 4**"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

{"board":[["🦮","🌕","🦭","💫"],["🌕","🦭","💫","💫"],["🌕","🦮","🌕","💫"],["💫","🌕","🦮","🌕"]],"response":["<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve this problem where I have a rectangular board made up of emojis, and I have to count how many horizontal or vertical lines there are, where each line is made by the same emoji and is at least length 2. The answer needs to be the total count of such lines.\n\nFirst, I should look at the board they gave. It's a 4x4 grid because there are four rows each with four emojis. Let me write it out to visualize better.\n\nThe board looks like this:\n\nRow 1: 🦮 🌕 🦭 💫\nRow 2: 🌕 🦭 💫 💫\nRow 3: 🌕 🦮 🌕 💫\nRow 4: 💫 🌕 🦮 🌕\n\nHmm, okay, maybe I'll number the rows and columns for easier reference. So rows are 1 to 4 from top to bottom, and columns 1 to 4 from left to right.\n\nSo, in grid form:\n\nRow 1: 1: 🦮, 2:🌕, 3:🦭, 4:💫\nRow 2: 1:🌕, 2:🦭, 3:💫, 4:💫\nRow 3: 1:🌕, 2:🦮, 3:🌕, 4:💫\nRow 4: 1:💫, 2:🌕, 3:🦮, 4:🌕\n\nI think I should check for horizontal lines first, then vertical lines, maybe, or perhaps check each row and column. I need to check each possible line of two or more same emojis, regardless of whether it's longer than 2. But wait, if a line is longer than 2, like 4, does that count as multiple lines? For example, a row of 4 same emojis: does that count as 3 lines (2+2+2, overlapping) or just one. Wait, the problem says lines of length 2 or more, so each possible run. So for a horizontal line of 4, how many lines can be formed? It's 3. Because positions 1-2, 2-3, 3-4 are all lines of 2, but also, the longer lines may have a count of their own.\n\nWait, no, the question is to count the number of lines, which are made by same emojis in a row. So for a row of 4 same emojis, there's one line of length 4, which counts as 1 line. But wait, maybe the problem counts every possible consecutive pair. Let me check the problem statement again. Oh, it says 'lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.' So each maximal line (i.e., each run) as long as it's at least 2 long. So for a run of 3, it counts as one line. For a run of 4, it's another, so as maximal sequences.\n\nWait, no, that's conflicting. Or perhaps it's easier to think in terms of each consecutive same emoji sequence regardless of whether they are longer than 2. So perhaps I should count each maximal run of same emojis:\n\nWait the problem states: 'a line is formed by the same emoji, with length of 2 or more.' So each consecutive horizontal or vertical line of minimum 2, but they can be longer. But when counting, each such continuous line counts once per maximal length.\n\nWait, no, perhaps each line that's at least length 2, regardless of whether it's part of a longer line.\n\nWait, for example, if in a row, I have three same emojis: A A A.\n\nThen, in horizontal direction, there are two possible lines of length 2: positions 1-2 and 2-3, plus one line of length 3 (1-3). But the problem says to count each horizontal or vertical line that has the same emoji and length >=2.\n\nHmm, I think the way the problem is phrased implies that each individual line of same emojis in a row, whether overlapping or not. So regardless of how many emojis are in a run, each possible consecutive pair or longer counts as a line. But that would complicate things because for a run of n same emojis, there are (n-1) possible lines of length 2, (n-2) of length 3, etc.\n\nWait, but looking at the sample input:\n\nLooking at the board, in row 2, columns 3-4 are both 💫, so that's a line of 2. So that counts as one.\n\nIn row 3, columns 1-3: 🌕 🦮 🌕 → is there a line? The first and third are same, but the middle isn't. So no.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the counting doesn't require the line to have continuous same emojis beyond the pair. Wait, no, the line is formed by same emojis in a row or column. So the lines must be continuous.\n\nSo in row 3, columns 1 is 🌕, column 3 is 🌕, but column 2 is 🦮, which is different. So that doesn't form a line.\n\nSo for horizontal lines:\n\nCheck each row. For each row, scan left to right from column 1, and look for consecutive same emojis. Each time a pair or longer is found, it's a line.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to look for all possible runs in each row and column, and count each run if its length is >=2.\n\nWait, the question says, \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So each line that is (a) either horizontal or vertical, (b) formed by same emojis, (c) has length at least 2. So whether a line is maximal or not, the line is a single count regardless of how long it is beyond 2.\n\nWait for example, if in a row, we have four same emojis, that's one line of length 4, which is counted as one line. Because it's one continuous line. But if I have a line split into two parts, maybe not overlapping, like in a row, two separate lines of same emojis, each of length 2, both are counted.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused.\n\nLooking back to the problem statement. The question says, \"the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" Oh, perhaps for each line that is either horizontal or vertical, and runs as long as possible in that direction, it's counted once if it's >=2. So each maximal run, regardless of direction, counts as one as long as it's length >=2.\n\nYes, that's the approach. Because, otherwise, if we count every possible pair, then for a run of n same emojis, there would be (n-1) pairs, which would add a lot to the count, but that doesn't seem to be the case in the sample inputs, perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider each contiguous line (run) of same emojis in a row or column, and count each run once if it's 2 or longer.\n\nSo for each such run in horizontal and vertical directions, count 1 per run if it's >=2 in length.\n\nSo the process should be:\n\n1. Check all horizontal runs (rows) and count how many are >=2 in length.\n\n2. Check all vertical runs (columns) and count how many are >=2.\n\nLet me try applying this to the given board.\n\nLet's process each row for horizontal runs.\n\nRow 1: 🦮 🌕 🦭 💫 → no runs of 2 same in a row. So 0.\n\nRow 2: 🌕 🦭 💫 💫 → looking for consecutive same. Positions 3&4 are 💫, so that's a run of 2 → count 1.\n\nRow 3: 🌕 🦮 🌕 💫 → look for any consecutive same. Looking at each pair:\n\n1-2: 🌕 and 🦮 → different.\n\n2-3: 🦮 and 🌕 → different.\n\n3-4: 🌕 and 💫 → different. So no horizontal runs in row 3.\n\nRow 4: 💫 🌕 🦮 🌕 → no runs.\n\nSo horizontal runs are 1.\n\nNow for vertical runs. Let's check each column.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow 1: 🦮\n\nRow 2: 🌕\n\nRow 3: 🌕\n\nRow 4: 💫\n\nSo the column is 🦮, 🌕, 🌕, 💫.\n\nLooking for consecutive same emojis. Let's see:\n\nRows 1-2: 🦮 to 🌕 → no.\n\nRows 2-3: 🌕 and 🌕 → same, that's a run of at least 2 (run of length 2). So that's a vertical run of length 2.\n\nRows 3-4: 🌕 to 💫 → different. So column 1 has one vertical run.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow 1: 🌕\n\nRow 2: 🦭\n\nRow 3: 🦮\n\nRow 4: 🌕\n\nSo all are different. No runs >=2.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow 1: 🦭\n\nRow 2: 💫\n\nRow 3: 🌕\n\nRow 4: 🦮\n\nAll different. No runs.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nRow 1: 💫\n\nRow 2: 💫\n\nRow 3: 💫\n\nRow4: 🌕\n\nLooking for consecutive:\n\nRows 1-2: same → run of 2, count 1.\n\nRows 2-3: same → since it's already started from row 1, this is a run of 3. So the run spans rows 1,2,3: that's a vertical run of length 3 → count 1.\n\nRow 3-4: 💫 to 🌕 → different.\n\nSo column 4 has a single vertical run of length 3.\n\nWait, but each consecutive pair, would that be separate runs? Let me think.\n\nIn column 4:\n\nRow1: 💫 , row2:💫 → same, so a run of 2 (count+1)\n\nRow2: 💫 , row3:💫 → same, which is the same as the run started in row1. So whether the run is one or whether the same would be considered part of a longer run.\n\nWait, the run starts at row 1 and continues to row 2, row3. So that's a single vertical run of length 3. So we count it as one.\n\nThus, for each column, we scan for runs and each time a consecutive same as the one before, we extend the run, and if it's >=2 at any point, we count it as a single run if it's a maximal sequence.\n\nThus:\n\nColumn1: one run (rows 2-3: 🌕,🌕)\n\nColumn4: one run (rows1-3: all 💫, which makes three, so count as one.)\n\nSo total vertical runs: column1 gives 1, column4 gives 1, others 0. So vertical runs are 2.\n\nTherefore, total lines: horizontal runs 1 + vertical runs 2 = 3.\n\nWait, but let me go through each vertical column again to make sure.\n\nLet me recheck each column.\n\nColumn1 data:\n\nRow1: 🦮, Row2:🌕, Row3:🌕, Row4:💫.\n\nSo in order:\n\nRow2 and Row3: same → so one run (length 2). So that counts as 1.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRows 1,2,3: all 💫.\n\nSo it's a single run of length 3. So that counts as 1.\n\nAre there any other vertical runs?\n\nCheck column2:\n\nRow data: 🌕, 🦭, 🦮, 🌕. All different.\n\nNo runs.\n\nColumn3: 🦭, 💫, 🌕, 🦮. All different.\n\nNo runs.\n\nSo vertical: 2.\n\nHorizontal: 1.\n\nSo total lines: 3.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing some vertical runs somewhere else. Let me think.\n\nWait, in row3, column3 is 🌕, and row4, column3 is 🦮. Different. So nothing there.\n\nWait are there other horizontal lines? I'll check each row again.\n\nRow1: 🦮, 🌕, 🦭, 💫 → no.\n\nRow2: (positions3-4: 💫,💫 → horizontal run, count 1.\n\nRow3: no.\n\nRow4: no.\n\nSo horizontal runs: 1.\n\nFor vertical:\n\nColumn1: one.\n\nColumn4: one.\n\nThus, 2 in vertical.\n\nTotal of 3 lines.\n\nWait, but there's another possible line: in column4, rows 1-3 are all 💫, which is a vertical run. So it's a single line of length 3. That counts as one.\n\nIn column1, rows 2-3 are 🌕,🌕. So that's another line.\n\nSo 2 vertical.\n\nIs there another line?\n\nLooking again at column1, are there any runs elsewhere? e.g., between row3 and row4. No, because row3 is 🌕 to row4 is 💫.\n\nWhat about in column4, any other runs beyond the top three rows.\n\nWait, rows2-3: also same but they are part of the same longer run.\n\nSo I think that's correct.\n\nWait, wait: another thought. Let me make a grid.\n\nAnother approach is, for each cell, check to the right and below to see if the next cell(s) in that direction form a line of same emoji, at least length 2.\n\nBut that approach might count overlapping runs correctly. However, it's time-consuming.\n\nBut since the grid is small (4x4), perhaps I can do that spot check.\n\nSo for horizontal lines, in row2, columns3 and 4 both are 💫. So that's one line.\n\nLooking for other horizontal lines:\n\nRow3, columns 1-3: 🌕, 🦮, 🌕 → no runs there.\n\nLooking for any line where two or more same in a row.\n\nNow, vertical lines: column1 has a run in row2 and row3. So that's one line.\n\nColumn4 has a run from row1 to row3: that's another line.\n\nAny other vertical runs? Let's see:\n\nLooking in column2:\n\nRow2: 🦭, row3: 🦮 → different.\n\nNo.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow2:💫, row3: 🌕 → different.\n\nNo.\n\nSo that's it.\n\nThus the total is 3 lines.\n\nSo the answer should be 3.\n\nBut wait, let me think if I might have missed some, perhaps in the vertical or horizontal.\n\nFor example, is row3, column2: 🦮, and row4, column2: 🌕? No, they're different.\n\nWhat about row3, column3 is 🌕, row4, column3 is 🦮. Different. So no.\n\nAny other columns:\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps I missed column 3.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow1: 🦭, row2:💫, row3:🌕, row4:🦮.\n\nAll different, so nothing.\n\nThus, I'm confident that the total number of lines is 3.

{"board":[["🐏","🦆","🦙","🦆"],["🌒","🦆","🦆","🌒"],["🦆","🌒","🌒","🌒"],["🦙","🦆","🌒","🦆"]],"response":["<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I have a rectangular board made up of emojis. My task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, and the lines must have a length of 2 or more. Then, I have to output the total count of such lines.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the board properly. Let me write it down row by row based on the given input. \n\nThe board is as follows:\n\nRow 1: 🐏 🦆 🦙 🦆\nRow 2: 🌕 🦆 🦆 🌕\nRow 3: 🦆 🌕 🌕 🌕\nRow 4: 🦙 🦆 🌕 🦆\n\nSo, each row has four elements. The board is 4x4 in size.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to check each row for horizontal lines and each column for vertical lines. For each row, I'll go through and count sequences of the same emoji that are at least 2 long. Similarly, for each column, I'll do the same.\n\nLet me start by analyzing the rows.\n\nRow 1: 🐏, 🦆, 🦙, 🦆\nLooking at each element:\n- The first element is 🐏, which is different from the next, so that's a sequence of 1, which doesn't count.\n- Next is 🦆. The next element is 🦙, which is different, so another single.\n- Then 🦙 and 🦆 follow; both are single, no lines here.\nSo, row 1 has no horizontal lines.\n\nRow 2: 🌕, 🦆, 🦆, 🌕\nLooking at each element:\n- 🌕 is followed by 🦆, so no.\n- Then, 🦆 and 🦆: that's a sequence of 2. So that's one horizontal line of length 2.\n- After that, 🦆 and 🌕 are different, so that's a single.\nSo row 2 contributes 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow 3: 🦆, 🌕, 🌕, 🌕\nLooking at each element:\n- 🦆 is followed by 🌕, so no.\n- Now, 🌕 is followed by 🌕, then another 🌕. So there's a sequence of 3. That counts as one line (since it's 3 in a row). Wait, but in our counting, each contiguous sequence of the same emoji with length ≥2 is one line. So three in a row would be a single line of length 3. So row 3 contributes 1 horizontal line.\n\nWait, but I need to think: Do I count each possible consecutive line. Like, a run of 3 can include runs of 2. No, because each line is considered as a maximum-length contiguous sequence. So, for 'AAAB', I have one 3-length line, not multiple. So in row 3, it's one line of length 3.\n\nRow 4: 🦙, 🦆, 🌕, 🦆\nLooking at each element:\n- 🦙 is single, next is 🦆, but not same as previous, then 🌕 which is different, and last 🦆 which is different.\nSo no horizontal lines in row 4.\n\nNow, onto vertical lines. For vertical lines, I need to check each column across all four rows.\n\nLet's number the columns from 1 to 4.\n\nColumn 1:\nRow 1: 🐏\nRow 2: 🌕\nRow 3: 🦆\nRow 4: 🦙\nAll are different, so no lines.\n\nColumn 2:\nRow 1: 🦆\nRow 2: 🦆\nRow 3: 🌕\nRow 4: 🦆\nWait, let me list them:\n🦆 (row1), 🦆 (row2), 🌕 (row3), 🦆 (row4).\nNow, looking for consecutive same emojis vertically.\n\nBetween row1 and row2: both 🦆. That's a sequence of 2. So that contributes 1 vertical line. Rows 1-2 are same.\nThen, row2 is 🦆, row3 is 🌕: different, so sequence stops.\nRow3 is 🌕, row4 is 🦆: different again. So column 2 has 1 vertical line (at rows 1-2 and 2-1).\n\nWait, no: in a column, each continuous same emojis count as one line. For column 2:\n\nRow1: 🦆, row2: 🦆 → same → line of length 2. So that's one vertical line.\n\nThen, row3 is different, row4 is 🦆 but row3 was 🌕, so no. So column 2 has 1 vertical line.\n\nWait, but let's verify: check contiguous sequences in the column. So:\n\n- R1 and R2: both 🦆, so a line starts, length 2. There's a line here.\n- R3 is 🌕, so sequence stops.\n- R3 and R4: 🌕 vs 🦆, so no.\nSo, column 2 has 1 vertical line.\n\nMoving on to column 3:\n\nColumn 3 elements:\nRow1: 🦙\nRow2: 🦆\nRow3: 🌕\nRow4: 🌕\n\nWait:\n\nRow3: 🌕\n\nRow4: 🌕\nSo row3 and row4 are same in column 3. That's a vertical line of length 2. So column 3 contributes 1 line.\n\nWhat about column4:\n\nColumn4 elements:\nRow1: 🦆\nRow2: 🌕\nRow3: 🌕\nRow4: 🦆\n\nSo:\n\nRow1: 🦆\n\nRow2: 🌕 → different from row1.\n\nRow2: 🌕, row3: 🌕 → same, so that's a vertical line. Rows 2-3: 2 in a row.\n\nRow3: 🌕, row4: 🦆 → different.\n\nSo in column4, there's a vertical line starting at row2 to row3, which is 2 elements. So that's one vertical line.\n\nWait, let me count each column's vertical lines.\n\nWait, column 1: no sequences.\n\nColumn 2: one sequence (rows1-2).\n\nColumn3: one sequence (rows3-4).\n\nColumn4: one sequence (rows2-3).\n\nSo, from the columns, I have 3 vertical lines.\n\nWait, let me recount.\n\nColumn1:\n\n🐏, 🌕, 🦆, 🦙 → all different. So no lines.\n\nColumn2:\n\n🦆, 🦆, 🌕, 🦆\nBetween R1 and R2: same → line of 2.\nBetween R2 and R3: different.\nR3 & R4: different. So only one line in column2.\n\nColumn3:\n\n🦙, 🦆, 🌕, 🌕\nCheck each pair:\nR1 vs R2: different (🦙 vs 🦆)\nR2 vs R3: 🦆 vs 🌕 → different.\nR3 vs R4: same 🌕 → line of 2. So yes, one vertical line.\n\nWait, no. Let's think differently. The column as a whole can have multiple runs. Wait, runs are where consecutive elements are same. So for column3:\n\nRow1: 🦙\nRow2: 🦆\nRow3: 🌕\nRow4: 🌕\n\nSo the rows 3 and 4 are same. That's a single vertical line of length 2. So column3 contributes 1.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow1: 🦆\nRow2: 🌕\nRow3: 🌕\nRow4: 🦆\n\nWe have rows 2 and 3 as 🌕, 🌕: that's a line of 2. So column4 contributes 1.\n\nThat makes 3 vertical lines.\n\nWait, but column2 had one line. column3 had one, column4 had one. So 1+1+1=3.\n\nWait, that's 3 vertical lines.\n\nWait, what about rows beyond 2? Like, are there any longer runs? Let's see:\n\nIn column3, the only same elements are rows3 and4. So that's one run.\n\nIn column2, rows1 and2 are same (🦆). Then in row3 and4? different. So just one in column2.\n\nNow, for the columns, we've got 3 vertical lines.\n\nNow, let's recap: horizontal lines.\n\nRow2 had one line (🦆🦆), row3 had one line (🌕🌕🌕). So that's 2 horizontal lines.\n\nSo total lines would be 2 (horizontal) + 3 (vertical) = 5.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow1: nothing.\n\nRow2: 🌕 🦆 🦆 🌕 → the middle two are 🦆🦆. So 1 horizontal.\n\nRow3: 🦆 🌕 🌕 🌕 → the last three 🌕🌕🌕, which is 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow4: nothing.\n\nSo horizontal lines: 2.\n\nVertical lines:\n\nColumn2 has one, column3 has one, column4 has one. So 3.\n\nSo total lines: 2 +3=5.\n\nThus, the answer should be 5.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more, on a 4x4 rectangular board.

{"board":[["🐖","🐖","🐭","🐭"],["🥰","🦍","🥰","🥰"],["🐖","🦍","🦍","🦍"],["🥰","🦍","🐭","🦍"]],"response":["<think>\nOkay, let's try to solve this problem. So, the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines on a rectangular board made up of emojis. Each line must consist of the same emoji and have a length of at least 2.\n\nHmm, the first thing I should do is understand the board's structure. The board is given as four rows, each with four columns. Let me write it down to visualize better.\n\nRow 1: 🐖 🐖 🐭 🐭\nRow 2: 🥰 🦍 🥰 🥰\nRow 3: 🐖 🦍 🦍 🦍\nRow 4: 🥰 🦍 🐭 🦍\n\nWait, let me count each row. Each has exactly four emojis, perfect.\n\nSo, I'm supposed to check for lines in each row (horizontal) and each column (vertical), looking for sequences where the same emoji repeats for 2 or more cells in a straight line.\n\nLet me start with the horizontal lines. I'll go through each row and check for consecutive same emojis of length >=2.\n\nRow 1:\n1. 🐖 🐖: that's a line of 2. So count +=1\n2. Next, the third and fourth are 🐭🐭, that's another line of 2. Count +=1 again. So row 1 contributes 2.\n\nRow 2:\nLooking at the emojis: 🥰 🦍 🥰 🥰\nNo two same consecutive, so nothing here.\n\nRow 3:\n🐖 followed by 🦍🦍🦍. So the 🦍🦍🦍 is a line of 3. So count +=1.\n\nRow4:\n🥰 🦍 🐭 🦍. No same consecutive, so nothing here.\n\nSo total horizontal lines are 2 (from row1) + 1 (row3) = 3.\n\nNow check vertical lines. That's columns. So each column has four emojis, let's go each one by one.\n\nColumn 1:\nRow1: 🐖\nRow2: 🥰\nRow3: 🐖\nRow4: 🥰\nNo consecutive same emojis. No lines.\n\nColumn 2:\nRow1: 🐖\nRow2: 🦍\nRow3: 🦍\nRow4: 🦍\nWait, row2, 3,4: 🦍, 🦍, 🦍. That's a vertical line of length 3. So count +=1.\n\nColumn3:\nRow1: 🐭\nRow2: 🥰\nRow3: 🦍\nRow4: 🐭\nNo consecutive same, nothing here.\n\nColumn4:\nRow1: 🐭\nRow2: 🥰\nRow3: 🦍\nRow4: 🦍\nWait, rows 3 and 4 in column4 are 🦍 and 🦍. That's a line of 2, so count +=1.\n\nWait, how about other possible lines in column4? Let me check:\n\nRow1: 🐭\nRow2: 🥰 -> no same as row1. Row3: 🦍, row4: 🦍. So only rows 3 and 4 same.\n\nSo column4 contributes 1.\n\nSo, vertical lines contribute 2 (from column2 and column4) lines.\n\nAdding horizontal and vertical: 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nWait wait, did I miss any other vertical lines?\n\nLet me double-check each column.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow1: 🐖\nRow2: 🥰\nRow3: 🐖\nRow4: 🥰\n\nDifferent each step. So no line.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow2 🦍, row3 🦍, row4 🦍. 3 in a row, so yes, vertical line of 3. That's one line.\n\nIs there another line within the same column?\n\nNo, because the rest are varying. So only one vertical line in column2.\n\nWait, is a vertical line only when the same emojis are in consecutive cells? Yes. So I don't count non-consecutive same emojis.\n\nSo column2 has a run of 3, which counts as one line.\n\nWhat about column4? It's row3 and row4: two 🦍s, consecutive, yes.\n\nSo vertical lines: 2.\n\nNow horizontal: row1 has two horizontal lines (two separate sets), row3 has one. So 3.\n\nWait, wait: in row1, I have two pairs: 🐖🐖 and 🐭🐭. Each pair contributes to a single line each, even though they are adjacent to different emojis or not, right? Because each consecutive same pair is counted as a line, but same as if it's longer.\n\nIn row3, 🐖 is alone, but then 🦍🦍🦍 is a single line of 3, which counts as one line.\n\nSo adding up, horizontal: 2+1=3.\n\nSo overall, 3 + 2 =5.\n\nWait, any possibility I missed lines elsewhere?\n\nWait another thought: what about the line longer than 2? For example, row3's 🦍🦍🦍 is a single line of length 3. But if it's longer, does that count as just one line or multiple?\n\nBecause the question says \"length of 2 or more\". So each contiguous sequence of 2 or more is one line.\n\nSo, regardless of the length, each group forms a single line.\n\nSo for example, a sequence of 4 same emojis in a line is just one line, not 3 (for each pair or triplet).\n\nSo yes, in row3, the three 🦍s count as one line.\n\nSo, yes, I think I got it right. 3+2=5.\n\nWait, wait, wait. Let me think again. Because sometimes, a longer line can contain multiple segments that are each of length 2. But the way the question is phrased, I'm to count the number of lines, where each line is a maximal run... Hmm.\n\nWait the problem statement says \"the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\"\n\nWait, maybe overlapping lines are considered. Wait, no, I think each run (contiguous group) is a single line, regardless of length.\n\nSo for example, a run of 3 is treated as a single line, not two separate lines (like [🐭🐭🐭]: this would count as one line, not two because two of them could form two lines of 2 length each, but in a group of 3, it's counted once).\n\nLet me recheck each row:\n\nRow 1:\n🐖🐖🐭🐭\n\n- First two 🐖: count 1\n- Next two 🐭: count 1. So row1 is 2.\n\nRow3:\n🐖🦍🦍🦍: only the last three 🦍 count as 1.\n\nSo for rows, it's correct.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn2: 🦍🦍🦍. Wait, no. Look again.\n\nWait, column 2 is:\n\nRow1: 🐖\n\nRow2: 🦍\n\nRow3: 🦍\n\nRow4: 🦍\n\nSo cells:\n\nRow2: 🦍, row3: 🦍, row4: 🦍 → a vertical line of 3, thus one line.\n\nSimilarly, column4:\n\nrow3 and row4 have 🦍, so a vertical line of 2. So another line.\n\nSo that's two vertical lines.\n\nWait, perhaps another thought: are the three 🦍 in column2 all consecutive? Yes, so the entire run is one line.\n\nAdditionally, is there any other vertical line in column2? No, because row1 is different. Only rows2-4 contribute.\n\nSo yes, total vertical lines 2.\n\nPutting all together, 3 (horizontal) +2 (vertical) =5 lines.\n\nSo the answer is 5.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more on a given 4x4 board.

{"board":[["☀️","❄️","🪐","☀️"],["🪐","❄️","🪐","🪐"],["🪐","🐮","☀️","☀️"],["🪐","☀️","❄️","❄️"]],"response":["<think>\nOkay, so I've got this problem here about counting the number of horizontal or vertical lines on a board made of emojis. Each line has to be made of the same emoji and has to be at least 2 in length. I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super experienced with these kinds of problems, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably visualize the board. The problem gives the board as four rows, each with four emojis. Let me write them out clearly:\n\nRow 1: ☀️ ❄️ 🪐 ☀️\nRow 2: 🪐 ❄️ 🪐 🪐\nRow 3: 🪐 🐮 ☀️ ☀️\nRow 4: 🪐 ☀️ ❄️ ❄️\n\nWait, maybe numbering the rows from top to bottom as 1 to 4, and the columns from left to right as 1 to 4 would help. So each cell can be identified by (row, column).\n\nNow, I remember that I need to check both horizontal and vertical lines. I'll have to go through each cell and check in both directions for consecutive same emojis.\n\nLet me start with horizontal lines. For each row, I'll scan each cell and see how long a line of same emojis it forms to the right.\n\nRow 1: ☀️, ❄️, 🪐, ☀️\n- Starting at position (1,1): it's ☀️. Next cell is ❄️, different. So no line.\n- At (1,2): ❄️, next is 🪐, different.\n- At (1,3): 🪐, next is ☀️, different.\n- At (1,4): alone, nothing.\nNo lines here.\n\nRow 2: 🪐, ❄️, 🪐, 🪐\n- (2,1): 🪐, next is ❄️, different.\n- (2,2): ❄️, next is 🪐, different.\n- (2,3): 🪐, next is 🪐. So that's a line of length 2. So count this as one.\n- Also, the last two together form a line of length 2 starting at (2,3), ending at (2,4). So that's another one, but wait, no. Because the two in position 3-4 are part of the same run. Wait, no, in row 2, the emojis are 🪐, ❄️, 🪐, 🪐. So from 3 to 4, it's two 🪐, so that's a line. Count that as one.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing something. Let me clarify. Each consecutive same emoji sequence in a row is a horizontal line. So for row 2: 🪐, ❄️, 🪐, 🪐. The last two 🪐 are a line of length 2, so that counts as one line.\n\nRow 3: 🪐, 🐮, ☀️, ☀️\n- Starting (3,1): 🪐, next is 🐮, no.\n- (3,2): 🐮, next is ☀️, no.\n- (3,3): ☀️, next is ☀️, so line of 2, count one.\n\nRow4: 🪐, ☀️, ❄️, ❄️\n- (4,1): 🪐, next is ☀️, no.\n- (4,2): ☀️, next is ❄️, no.\n- (4,3): ❄️, next is ❄️, so line of 2, count one.\n\nSo horizontally, I have:\n\nRow 2: one line (cells 3-4).\nRow3: one line (3-4).\nRow4: one line (3-4).\nWait, that's 3 lines so far.\n\nWait, row 2, the line starts at 3rd position and is two in length. So that's one line. Correct.\n\nWhat about vertical lines? Need to check each column, starting from each cell, and see how many same emojis are below.\n\nLet me check column by column.\n\nColumn 1:\nRow1 (1,1): ☀️\nRow2 (2,1): 🪐\nRow3 (3,1): 🪐\nRow4 (4,1): 🪐\nSo each cell's emoji:\nRow1: ☀️\nSo only row2,3,4 are 🪐, but they're in a vertical line from row2-4? Let's see: (2,1) is 🪐, (3,1) is 🪐, (4,1) is 🪐. That's three consecutive same emojis. So from 2-4, that's a line of length 3, which counts as one line. Because the problem counts any line of length >=2, regardless of longer lengths counting once per maximal possible.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the count is the number of distinct lines, but perhaps lines are counted per their start and end points, or per their maximal possible.\n\nHmm, I think perhaps each maximal run is counted as one line. Because for vertical lines, a run of 3 same emojis in a column would form a single vertical line of length 3, but it's still just one line.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So each contiguous block (maximal) in a row or column of length 2 or more counts as one line per such block.\n\nSo in this column 1, rows 2-4 are three 🪐, which is a vertical line of length 3. So counting that as one line.\n\nWait, let me confirm. For example: in row2, if there are three same emojis in a line, that's counted as one line of length 3, and similarly for vertical.\n\nSo for this column, that's one vertical line of length 3.\n\nColumn 2:\nRow1: ❄️\nRow2: ❄️\nRow3: 🐮\nRow4: ☀️\nSo looking at each cell:\n\nRow1: ❄️\nRow2: ❄️ \nSo between row1 and row2, the same. So vertical run from row1 to row2, length 2. So that counts as one vertical line.\n\nRow3 is 🐮, different, so no. Row4 is ☀️, no.\n\nSo column2: one vertical line (row1-row2).\n\nColumn3:\nRow1: 🪐\nRow2: 🪐\nRow3: ☀️\nRow4: ❄️\nSo in row1 and row2: 🪐, same. So that's a vertical line of length 2. So one.\n\nRow3 is ☀️, different.\n\nSo column3: one vertical line (row1-row2).\n\nColumn4:\nRow1: ☀️\nRow2: 🪐\nRow3: ☀️\nRow4: ❄️\nLooking for consecutive same emojis.\n\nRow1: ☀️, next is row2: 🪐, different. So no line.\n\nRow2: 🪐, row3: ☀️, different.\n\nRow3: ☀️, row4:❄️, different.\n\nSo no vertical lines in column4.\n\nSo in vertical lines, how many do I have? Let's tally:\n\nColumn1: 1\nColumn2: 1\nColumn3:1\nColumn4:0. So total of 3 vertical lines.\n\nSo adding horizontal and vertical:\n\nHorizontal lines found:\n\nRow2:1\nRow3:1\nRow4:1 → total of 3.\n\nVertical lines:\n\n3.\n\nTotal lines = 3 +3 =6.\n\nWait, wait. Wait a second, maybe I missed some while checking.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recount each.\n\nLet's take horizontal again, row by row.\n\nRow1: No lines.\n\nRow2: 🪐, ❄️, 🪐, 🪐. So the last two 🪐 form a line, so one.\n\nRow3: 🪐, 🐮, ☀️, ☀️. So last two form a line, one.\n\nRow4: 🪐, ☀️, ❄️, ❄️. Last two form a line, one.\n\nSo 3 lines so far.\n\nNow, vertical:\n\nColumn1: rows 2-4: 🪐, line of 3 → 1 line.\n\nColumn2: rows 1-2: ❄️, line of 2 →1.\n\nColumn3: rows1-2: 🪐, line of 2 →1.\n\nAny others? Let me check column2 beyond the first two. For instance, row3 has 🐮, and row4 has nothing matching. So no further lines.\n\nWait, perhaps I didn't check deeper in column1. Rows2-4 are all 🪐, but in the column they're consecutive, so that's one line of 3, so 1 line.\n\nYes.\n\nSo vertical lines sum to 3.\n\nSo total lines would be 3 (horizontal) +3 (vertical) =6.\n\nWait, but wait. Maybe I made a mistake with row4. Let me double-check.\n\nYes, row4: 🪐, ☀️, ❄️, ❄️ → line at positions 3-4, count one.\n\nNow, looking again: Are there any longer lines? For example, could a vertical line have more than 3? No, the board is only 4 rows. So 3 is the maximum.\n\nWait, column1 has row2-4 all as 🪐, so that's 3 in a line.\n\nPutting it all together: 3 horizontal and 3 vertical lines. So 6 lines in total.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed something? Let me review the board again.\n\nWait, looking at column2, row1 is ❄️, row2 is ❄️: that's a vertical line of 2, correct. What about row2's anything else? No, because row3 is different.\n\nHmm, no, that's correct.\n\nAnother thought: maybe in some rows, there are multiple lines.\n\nNo, because each horizontal line is one contiguous block. So if in a row there are, say, four same emojis, that's one line.\n\nSo yeah, I think the total is 6.\n\nWait, no, wait.

{"board":[["🐵","🐰","🐵","🌳"],["🌱","🐵","🐵","🐵"],["🐵","🐵","🐰","🐰"],["🌱","🌳","🐰","🌱"]],"response":["<think>\nOkay, let's see. I have to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines on this emoji board where the emojis are the same, and each line has a length of 2 or more. Hmm, the board has 4 rows and each row has 4 emojis. I'll need to check each row for horizontal lines and each column for vertical lines.\n\nLet me start with the first row: 🐵🐰🐵🌳. Looking for same emojis in a row here. The first and third emojis are 🐵, but they are separated by 🐰, so the maximum in a row here might be 1 for each except between their positions. Wait, no, I should check the entire row. So looking for runs of two or more same emojis. \n\n- Position 1 and 2: 🐵 and 🐰 are different.\n- Position 2 and 3: 🐰 and 🐵 different.\n- Position 3 and 4: 🐵 and 🌳 different. So no horizontal lines in the first row. So zero lines here.\n\nMoving to the second row: 🌱🐵🐵🐵. Check consecutive emojis:\n- Start from 1: 🌱, 2 is 🐵 different. Check positions 2,3,4: 🐵🐵🐵. So that's a run of 3. So that counts as one line (but wait, it might contribute more counts if counts are for each possible consecutive segment). Hmm, the question is whether each contiguous group counts as one line as a whole. For example, a group of 3 counts as one line. So second row has one horizontal line of length 3.\n\nThird row: 🐵🐵🐰🐰. Check each group.\n- First two emojis: 🐵🐵, that's a run of 2. So one line. Then the last two: 🐰🐰, another line. So that's two horizontal lines in this row.\n\nFourth row: 🌱🌳🐰🌱. Let's see:\n- 1 and 2: 🌱 vs 🌳 different.\n- 2 and 3: 🌳 and 🐰 different.\n- 3 and 4: 🐰 and 🌱 different. So no lines here.\n\nSo total horizontal lines from rows: 0 +1 +2 +0 =3.\n\nNow let's check vertical lines. Need to check each column separately.\n\nLet's label rows as row1, row2, row3, row4.\n\nColumn 1:\n- row1: 🐵\n- row2: 🌱\n- row3: 🐵\n- row4: 🌱\nSo looking for consecutive same in vertical.\n\n- 🐵, 🌱 (different)\n- 🌱, 🐵 (diff)\n- 🐵, 🌱 (diff)\nNo lines in column 1.\n\nColumn2:\n- row1: 🐰\n- row2: 🐵\n- row3: 🐵\n- row4: 🌳\n\nCheck consecutive:\n1-2: 🐰 vs 🐵. No\n2-3: 🐵-🐵. That's a run of 2. So that counts as one line.\n3-4: 🐵 and 🌳: no.\n\nSo column2 has one vertical line.\n\nWait, but the run is row2 and row3. So that's a vertical line of length 2. But what about row4? It's different, so only rows 2 and3.\n\nSo column2 contributes one.\n\nColumn3:\n- row1: 🐵\n- row2: 🐵\n- row3: 🐰\n- row4: 🐰\n\nCheck vertical runs:\n\nrow1-2: 🐵-🐵: that's a run of 2. So that's one line.\nrow2-3: 🐵-🐰: no\nrow3-4: 🐰-🐰: another run of 2. So another line.\n\nSo column3 has two lines.\n\nSo adding column3's contributions: two lines.\n\nColumn4:\n- row1: 🌳\n- row2: 🐵\n- row3: 🐰\n- row4: 🌱\n\nEach row is different, no runs.\n\nSo for vertical lines: column2 (1) and column3 (2), total of 3.\n\nWait, is there any other runs? Let me check again column2: row2 and row3 🐵🐵. That's one. Column3: row1 and row2 🐵🐵 (one line), row3 and row4 🐰🐰 (another line). So that's two lines in column3.\n\nSo vertical lines: 0 (column1) +1 (col2) +2 (col3) +0 (col4) =3.\n\nSo total lines: horizontal (3) + vertical (3) =6.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I haven't missed any. Sometimes, there might be longer runs, but each row\/column run of N cells would contribute N-1 connections, but wait, the problem says count the number of lines with length >=2. So in the second row, the horizontal run of 3 is just one line because it's continuous, not split into groups. Similarly, a run of 4 would count as one line in that direction.\n\nSo in column3, we have two separate runs, each of length 2. That's two lines. So yeah, 3 horizontal, 3 vertical, total 6.\n\nSo the answer should be 6+3=9? Wait wait, I think I might have miscalculated before.\n\nWait, original calculation: horizontal lines are in rows:\n\n- row2: 1 line.\n- row3: 2 lines.\nWait, that's a total of 3.\n\nVertical lines:\n\n- column2: 1 line.\n- column3: 2 lines (two separate runs).\nWait that's 3.\n\nSo 3 +3=6.\n\nWait, I'm getting 6 as the total. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me recheck the row and column counts.\n\nRow1 horizontal: no lines.\n\nRow2: 3 in a row. So that's one line. Total: 1.\n\nRow3: two of 🐵 and two of 🐰. So two separate runs, each >=2. So two lines there.\n\nRow4: nothing. So horizontal lines are 3.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn1: no lines.\n\nColumn2: two 🐵 in rows 2 and 3, so one line.\n\nColumn3: two runs of 2. So row1-2: 🐵🐵 (line), rows3-4 🐰🐰 (line). So two lines in column3.\n\nColumn4: nothing. So verticals: 3.\n\nTotal lines: 3+3=6. So answer should be 6.\n\nWait, earlier I wrote that vertical lines are 3, horizontal lines 3, totaling 6.\n\nYes, that adds up to six.

{"board":[["🐋","🐋","🏄","🦎"],["🦩","🦩","🐋","🦎"],["🦩","🦎","🦩","🦎"],["🦎","🏄","🦩","🏄"]],"response":["<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to solve this problem where I have to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines on a board made up of emojis. Each line has to be formed by the same emoji and have a length of 2 or more. The board is given as a 4x4 grid. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem correctly. So, I have to look for consecutive same emojis either horizontally (across columns in the same row) or vertically (across rows in the same column). Each line must be at least length 2, so pairs, triplets, etc. Also, if there are lines longer than 2, I might need to see how they contribute to multiple lines of length 2 or more.\n\nWait, wait. Let me think: if there's a line of 4 same emojis, like in a row, how many lines does that count as? Because within that 4, there are lines of length 2, 3, and 4. Or maybe each possible consecutive section of 2 or more counts as a line. Or perhaps each individual maximum run is considered once. I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, the question says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So for each run of the same emoji, the length has to be 2 or more, and each such run counts as a line. But wait, no—if a row has 🐋🐋🐋, that's a single line of length 3. So it's one count. Or maybe any run of same emoji in a straight line counts as multiple lines if they can be divided into smaller lines?\n\nWait that doesn't make sense. So I think each maximal run is considered. Like, a run is a maximum possible straight line of the same emojis. So each such run contributes 1 to the count, provided its length is at least 2.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct. Let me check the problem statement again: \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So perhaps each such line counts as +1 regardless of how long it is, as long as it's 2 or more. So for example, four same in a line would count as one line of length 4, which is a single count, even though it contains smaller runs within. Or maybe that a run of length 4 contributes how many lines? Hmm, but in terms of segments, four in a row can form multiple lines: any consecutive two, three, or four. But I'm probably misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to count every possible straight line (horizontal or vertical) that consists of the same emoji, with length >=2. So each straight segment of length >=2 is one count, regardless of overlapping. But I think that's not correct either.\n\nAlternatively, for each row and column, we look for runs. For each run of k same emojis, the number of lines it contributes is (k-1). So in a run of 3, you have 2 lines (of length 2 each). Or perhaps the run is considered as one line regardless.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it differently. Let me take an example. Suppose a row is A A A A. How many lines does it contribute? Since it's four in a row, the line of length 4 is counted. Or does each pair or triplet within it count as separate lines? Like, the first two as a line, the middle two as another line, etc.\n\nBut the problem states the lines formed by same emoji with length at least two. So in a row like A A A, that's a line of length 3. So probably, if a run is of length n, it counts as the number of possible consecutive pairs. Like in A A A A, you have 3 lines of length 2, 2 lines of length 3, and 1 line of length 4. But I don't think that's the case here. Because that approach would count every possible segment, which might not be the intended interpretation.\n\nWait, the question in the problem says, \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So perhaps each maximal straight line in a row or column counts as one line. So each continuous run of same emoji in a line (horizontal row or vertical column) is considered as a single line, regardless of its length, as long as it's at least 2. So a run of 4 would count as one, even though it contains smaller runs within.\n\nWait, but think of the grid. Let me think in terms of processing each row and column.\n\nSo for each row, process each cell, check for runs.\n\nFor example, in a row: A A A B.\n\nIn this row, there's a run of A's of length 3. So that's one line. The B is a single, so no line.\n\nIn another row: A A B B.\n\nHere, there's two runs: A (length 2) and B (length 2), so this row contributes 2.\n\nWait, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if a row is A A B A A, then runs are AA (2), B (1, ignored), AA (2). So that row contributes 2 lines.\n\nSo for each row and column, we split into runs, each run that is of length >=2 contributes 1 to the count.\n\nBut then what about a vertical run. For example, in a column, if all four are A's, that's a run of 4, which is one line.\n\nSo the approach is: for each row and column, find runs of same emoji, count each run that's 2 or longer as 1.\n\nSo now, the plan is:\n\n1. For each row in the board, process each row and count the number of runs of >=2.\n\n2. For each column in the board, process each column and count the number of runs of >=2.\n\nAdd these together.\n\nSo now, I need to process the given board.\n\nThe board is given as:\n\nEach row is:\n1: 🐋🐋🏄🦎 → let's call this row 1: '🐋', '🐋', '🏄', '🦎'\n\nRow 2: 🦩🦩🐋🦎 → row2: ['🦩', '🦩', '🐋', '🦎']\n\nRow3: 🦩🦎🦩🦎 → row3: ['🦩','🦎','🦩','🦎']\n\nRow4: 🦎🏄🦩🏄 → row4:[ '🦎','🏄','🦩','🏄']\n\nSo 4 rows, each 4 elements.\n\nNow, for each row:\n\nProcess row 1:\n\nElements: 🐋,🐋,🏄,🦎\n\nLooking for runs (consecutive same emojis):\n\n🐋 and 🐋: a run of 2 → count 1.\n\nNext is 🏄 and 🦎: single each → nothing.\n\nSo row1 contributes 1.\n\nRow2: 🦩🦩🐋🦎.\n\nFirst two: 🦩🦩 → run of 2 → count 1.\n\nThen 🐋🦎: single → nothing. So row2 contributes 1.\n\nRow3: 🦩🦎🦩🦎\n\nEach element is different from next. So no runs of 2. So row3 contributes 0.\n\nRow4: 🦎🏄🦩🏄.\n\nElements: 🦎, 🏄, 🦩, 🏄.\n\nNo two in a row, so no runs. So row4 contributes 0.\n\nSo rows contribute 1 +1 +0 +0 = 2.\n\nNow processing each column:\n\nSimilarly, columns are:\n\nCol1: 🐋 (row1), 🦩 (row2), 🦩 (row3), 🦎 (row4)\n\nSo elements: 🐋, 🦩, 🦩, 🦎.\n\nLet's look for runs in this column.\n\nFirst element: 🐋. Next is 🦩. Not same.\n\nThen, 🦩 and 🦩 → run of 2 → count 1.\n\nNext, 🦩 and 🦎. No.\n\nSo col1 contributes 1.\n\nCol2: 🐋 (row1-2nd element: 🐋?), wait wait wait... Let me think.\n\nWait, let's index correctly.\n\nWait, the first row is 🐋🐋🏄🦎 → row1, col1 is 🐋, row1, col2 is 🐋, row1, col3 is 🏄, row1, col4 is 🦎.\n\nRow2 is 🦩🦩🐋🦎: row2, col1 is 🦩, row2, col2 is 🦩, row2, col3 is 🐋, row2, col4 is 🦎.\n\nSimilarly for row3: 🦩, 🦎, 🦩, 🦎.\n\nRow4: 🦎, 🏄, 🦩, 🏄.\n\nSo columns are:\n\ncol1 = row1-col4: 🐋 (row1), 🦩 (row2), 🦩 (row3), 🦎 (row4).\n\ncol2 = 🐋, 🦩, 🦎, 🏄.\n\ncol3 = 🏄, 🐋, 🦩, 🦩.\n\ncol4 = 🦎, 🦎, 🦎, 🏄.\n\nWait, wait no:\n\nWait, row1 is elements 0,1:2,3 as 🐋,🐋,🏄,🦎.\n\nso row1: col1 → index0? Or perhaps it's better to think in zero-based indexes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the columns are as:\n\ncol1: row1-col1, row2-col1, etc.\n\nSo, col1:\n\nrow1: 🐋 (0)\n\nrow2: 🦩 (0)\n\nrow3: 🦩 (0)\n\nrow4: 🦎 (0)\n\nSo col1 elements: 🐋, 🦩, 🦩, 🦎.\n\nProcessing as a column, in order:\n\nCheck for consecutive repeats.\n\n🐋 and 🦩: no.\n\n🦩 and 🦩: yes → a run of two. → count 1.\n\n🦩 and 🦎: no.\n\nSo col1 contributes 1.\n\ncol2:\n\nrow1: 🐋 (row1 [col2: index1])\n\nrow2: 🦩 (row2 col2)\n\nrow3: 🦎 (row3 col2)\n\nrow4: 🏄 (row4 col2).\n\nSo elements: 🐋, 🦩, 🦎, 🏄.\n\nLooking for runs.\n\n+ 🐋, 🦩 → not same.\n\n+ 🦩, 🦎 → not same.\n\n+ 🦎, 🏄 → not same.\n\nSo no runs of 2. col2 contributes 0.\n\ncol3:\n\nrow1: 🏄 (row1, index2)\n\nrow2: 🐋 (row2, index2)\n\nrow3: 🦩 (row3, index2)\n\nrow4: 🦩 (row4, index2).\n\nSo elements: 🏄, 🐋, 🦩, 🦩.\n\nChecking for runs.\n\n🐋 and 🦩 are different.\n\n🦩 and 🦩 → yes, run of 2. So count 1.\n\nSo col3 contributes 1.\n\ncol4:\n\nrow1: 🦎 (row1, index3) \n\nrow2: 🦎 (row2 index3)\n\nrow3: 🦎 (row3 index3)\n\nrow4: 🏄 (row4 index3)\n\nElements: 🦎, 🦎, 🦎, 🏄.\n\nSo checking for runs.\n\nFirst two 🦎🦎: run of 2 → count 1.\n\nNext, 🦎 and 🏄 → no.\n\nNow, the entire column: 🦎, 🦎, 🦎, 🏄.\n\nLet me think: So the first two are 🦎🦎 (run of 2, counts 1). Then the next two: 🦎 in row3 and 🏄 → no.\n\nBut wait, in a column, the run is three 🦎's. So the entire first three are 🦎. That's a run of 3, which would count as 1 line.\n\nSo in the column, the run is three in a row, which is >=2, so it counts as a single line.\n\nSo for col4, the run is from row1 to row3: three in a row. So count 1.\n\nWait, or should it be that any consecutive same in the column constitutes a run. So in this case, from row1, row2, and row3: same in all three. So the run is 3.\n\nSo in Col4, this counts as one line. So col4 contributes 1.\n\nSo columns contribute 1 (col1) + 0 (col2) +1 (col3) +1 (col4) = 3.\n\nWait, but perhaps each column is scanned for runs. For example, in col4 (elements [🦎, 🦎, 🦎, 🏄]), the first three are a run of 3, so that counts as 1. So for the entire column, it's one line.\n\nThen, for the columns, total would be 3.\n\nAdding the row counts (2) and the column counts (3), total is 5.\n\nWait, so that would be 5 lines. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, rows:\n\nrow1 → 1 line.\n\nrow2 → 1 line.\n\nSo rows' total: 2.\n\ncolumns: \n\ncol1:1\n\ncol2:0\n\ncol3:1 \n\ncol4:1\n\ncolumns total: 3.\n\nSo total lines=2+3=5.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because I think I miscounted the columns.\n\nWait, column3:\n\nelements: 🏄, 🐋, 🦩, 🦩.\n\nLooking for any consecutive same. So indices 0-3.\n\nIndex 0: 🏄, index1: 🐋 → different.\n\nIndex1: 🐋, index2: 🦩 → different.\n\nIndex2: 🦩, index3: 🦩 → same.\n\nSo a run of two → 1 line.\n\nYes, so that's correct.\n\nWait, what about the column columns:\n\nBut wait, in column4, we have 🦎, 🦎, 🦎, 🏄. So the first three are same.\n\nSo that's a run of 3, which is a single line. So column4 contributes 1.\n\nSo columns' counts are correct.\n\nThen, the total is 2 (rows) +3 (columns) =5.\n\nWait, but are there any vertical lines?\n\nWait, is there any vertical line in the board beyond the columns?\n\nWait, for example, in row2 and row3 of column1, there are 🦩 and 🦩 → which form a line in the column. So that's in column1.\n\nBut also, perhaps in other places.\n\nWait, the only vertical line in a column is if a column has consecutive same emojis. So, for each column, process each element and group runs and count each run that's >=2 as 1.\n\nHmm, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the column3 contributes 1 because the last two elements are same. I think that's correct.\n\nSo, the total would be 5 lines.\n\nWait, but let me try to write down each row and column's run counts.\n\nRows:\n\nRow1: [🐋,🐋,🏄,🦎]\n\nRun of 2 → 1.\n\nRow2: [🦩,🦩,🐋,🦎]\n\nRun of 2 → 1.\n\nRow3: [🦩,🦎,🦩,🦎] → no runs.\n\nRow4: [🦎,🏄,🦩,🏄] → no runs.\n\nSo row: 1+1=2?\n\nWait, rows: row1:1, row2:1 → total 2.\n\nColumns:\n\ncol1: [🐋, 🦩, 🦩, 🦎]\n\nLooking at this, the 🦩, 🦩 is a run → 1.\n\ncol2: [🐋, 🦩, 🦎, 🏄] → no runs.\n\ncol3: [🏄, 🐋, 🦩, 🦩] → last two: run →1.\n\ncol4: [🦎, 🦎, 🦎, 🏄] → run of 3 →1.\n\nSo columns contribute 3 in total.\n\nThus, overall total is 2+3=5.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing some diagonal lines? Because the question says 'horizontal or vertical lines', so diagonal lines don't count. So no need to consider them.\n\nSo the final answer should be 5.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure: let me verify each row and column again.\n\nRow1:\n\n🐋🐋 → run of 2. So count 1.\n\nRow2:\n\n🦩🦩 → run of 2. So count 1.\n\nRows sum to 2.\n\nColumns:\n\ncol1:\n\nPositions row2: 🦩, row3: 🦩 → a run of 2 (since in the column, they are consecutive vertically). So col1 counts 1.\n\ncol3:\n\nrow4: 🦩 (position 2 in column3?), wait no. Column3:\n\nrow1: 🏄\n\nrow2: 🐋\n\nrow3: 🦩\n\nrow4: 🦩\n\nSo in column3, rows3 and 4 are 🦩, so a vertical run of 2. So col3 is 1.\n\ncol4:\n\nrow1: 🦎\n\nrow2: 🦎\n\nrow3: 🦎\n\nSo run of 3 →1.\n\nSo columns sum to 3.\n\nSo total is 5.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in column1's run: the column is 🐋, 🦩, 🦩, 🦎. So in positions (row1:0, row2:0, row3:0, row4:0). The two 🦩 are in row2 and row3 (positions 1 and 2). So they are consecutive vertically, so their run is length 2.\n\nThus, column1 contributes 1.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in column4, the three 🦎 are in rows1,2,3. So that's three consecutive 🦎, so run of 3 → counts as 1. \n\nSo yes, column4 is 1.\n\nNow, adding it all, 2 (rows) +3 (columns) =5.\n\nHmm, but let me see if there's any other run I might have missed.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRows:\n\nOnly rows 1 and 2 have runs.\n\nrow1: 🐋🐋...\n\nrow2: 🦩🦩...\n\ncolumns:\n\ncol1: 🦩🦩 (count 1)\n\ncol3: 🦩🦩 (count 1)\n\ncol4: 🦎🦎🦎 (count 1)\n\nSo yes, 3 columns contribute 3 runs.\n\nTotal is 5.\n\nThus, the final answer is 5.\n\nWait, but I feel I've missed a vertical run. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at column4: [🦎, 🦎, 🦎, 🏄].\n\nSo for this column, do we have another run than the obvious three in a row? The first element is 🦎, next is 🦎, next is 🦎.\n\nWait, what about the run between row2 and 3-? In the column of four elements, rows1-3 are same, so that's a single run. So yes, just 1 for this column.\n\nSo I think the total is indeed 5.

{"board":[["🌟","🌏","🌟","🌟"],["🌏","🌏","🧽","🍁"],["🌟","🍁","🌟","🧽"],["🍁","🌟","🌏","🍁"]],"response":["<think>\nOkay, I have this problem where I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines on a rectangular board made up of emojis. Each line must consist of the same emoji and be at least 2 units long. I need to check both rows and columns for such lines.\n\nFirst, I should probably write down the board to visualize it better. The board is given as four rows, each with four emojis. So it's a 4x4 grid. Let me list each row:\n\nRow 1: 🌟🌏🌟🌟\nRow 2: 🌏🌏🧽🍁\nRow 3: 🌟🍁🌟🧽\nRow 4: 🍁🌟🌏🍁\n\nWait, maybe I should index the rows and columns for better clarity. Let's number the rows from top to bottom as 0,1,2,3 and columns from left to right as 0,1,2,3.\n\nSo:\nRow 0: 0:🌟, 1:🌏, 2:🌟, 3:🌟\nRow 1: 0:🌏, 1:🌏, 2:🧽, 3:🍁\nRow 2: 0:🌟, 1:🍁, 2:🌟, 3:🧽\nRow 3: 0:🍁, 1:🌟, 2:🌏, 3:🍁\n\nNow, I need to check each row for horizontal lines. A horizontal line is a sequence of the same emoji in the same row, two or longer. Similarly, check each column for vertical lines — same emoji in the same column, two or longer.\n\nLet me tackle the horizontal lines first.\n\nFor each row:\n\nRow 0: 🌟, 🌏, 🌟, 🌟\nLet's break it down:\n- Positions 0 and 1: 🌟, 🌏 → different.\n- Position 2 and 3: 🌟, 🌟 → same. So that's a line of length 2.\nAdditionally, any other lines? Starting at 0: 🌟 followed by 🌏— no. At position 0, can't make a line longer than 2 except what's already noted. So in row 0, there is 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow 1: 🌏, 🌏, 🧽, 🍁\nLooking at the first two: 🌏 and 🌏 → line of 2. Is there a longer line? 3 in a row? Let's see: position 0-1: same, but position 2 is different. So just one line of length 2. So that's another count. So now total horizontal lines are 1+1=2 so far.\n\nRow 2: 🌟, 🍁, 🌟, 🧽\nCheck each part:\n- Positions 0-1: 🌟 and 🍁 → no.\n- Positions 1-2: 🍁 and 🌟 → no.\n- Positions 2-3: 🌟 and 🧽 → no.\nSo row 2 has no horizontal lines. No addition to the count.\n\nRow 3: 🍁, 🌟, 🌏, 🍁\nLooking for same repeated emojis:\n- 0 and1: 🍁, 🌟 → no.\n- 1 and 2: 🌟, 🌏 → no.\n- 2 and 3: 🌏, 🍁 → no.\nSo no horizontal lines in row 3.\n\nSo horizontal lines give a total of 2.\n\nNow, moving on to vertical lines. For each column, check all the consecutive cells in that column.\n\nThere are four columns, 0 to 3.\n\nLet's check column 0:\n\n✨ Column 0 entries:\nRow 0: 🌟\nRow 1: 🌏\nRow 2: 🌟\nRow 3: 🍁\n\nThese are all different. No line longer than 1. So no vertical lines in column 0.\n\nColumn 1:\nEntries:\nRow 0: 🌏\nRow 1: 🌏\nRow 2: 🍁\nRow 3: 🌟\n\nCheck between row 0 and row1 → same (🌏). So that's a line of 2. Do these extend further? Next is row 2: 🍁 is different, so line stops at 2. So one vertical line here.\n\nColumn 2:\nEntries:\nRow 0: 🌟\nRow 1: 🧽\nRow 2: 🌟\nRow 3: 🌏\n\nAll different, no lines.\n\nColumn 3:\nEntries:\nRow 0: 🌟\nRow 1: 🍁\nRow 2: 🧽\nRow 3: 🍁\n\nCheck for same emojis in sequence:\nRow 3 in column3 is 🍁, so below row0: 🌟, same? No. Next, row1: 🍁, different. Row2: 🧽, different. So no vertical lines in column 3.\n\nSo vertical lines: only column1 has one line of length 2. So total verticals:1.\n\nSo summing up, horizontal lines give 2, vertical 1. So total is 3.\n\nWait, wait. Wait a second. Did I count all possible vertical lines? Let me double-check.\n\nIn column 1, rows 0 and 1 are 🌏. So during the check, I counted that as one vertical line. Correct.\n\nAny longer lines elsewhere?\n\nFor columns:\n\nFor column 0: No lines. Column1: two same, so one line. Columns 2,3: no.\n\nSo verticals total 1.\n\nThus overall, horizontal + vertical is 3.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I missed something. Let me go through the grid again.\n\nReading it after the board:\n\nboard:\n🌟🌏🌟🌟\n🌏🌏🧽🍁\n🌟🍁🌟🧽\n🍁🌟🌏🍁\n\nLooking again, perhaps any other vertical lines?\n\nWait, in column 0: row0: 🌟, row2: 🌟. Are they consecutive? No, because row1 is 🌏, so it's not a continuous line. Similarly, any other columns? Like column2: row0: 🌟, row2: 🌟, but rows 0 and 2 are separated by row1 which is 🧽. So no continuous line there.\n\nHmm, okay. So the vertical line is only column1, two in a row. So vertical count is 1.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think about the definition again. The problem says lines formed by the same emoji, length ≥2. So a line is two or more in a straight horizontal or vertical line.\n\nAnother thought: for vertical lines, perhaps any consecutive sequence of same emojis in a column, regardless of where they are.\n\nWait, for column 3:\n\nRow 0: 🌟\nRow 1: 🍁\nRow 2: 🧽\nRow 3: 🍁\n\nIn column3, row3 is 🍁, and row1 is 🍁. Are these consecutive? No, because they are separated by row2. So no.\n\nSo nothing there.\n\nWhat about columns that have three in a row? Looking at column2:\n\nRow0: 🌟, row1: 🧽, row2: 🌟, row3: 🌏. All different. So no.\n\nOkay, so vertical lines are just one.\n\nNow, any horizontal line of length 3? Let's see:\n\nLooking at row0: 🌟 🌏 🌟 🌟\n\nSo after position2 comes 🌟 again. So positions 2 and3 are same, which makes a line of 2. So row0 has one line of 2.\n\nIn row1: 🌏, 🌏, 🧽, 🍁. The first two make a line of 2, but no longer.\n\nWhat about row2 and row3?\n\nRow2 has no lines. Row3 has no lines.\n\nWait, what about row0: the sequence after the 🌏 is 🌟, then 🌟, so two in a row. So row0 contributes one line.\n\nRow1: two in a row → when two length counts as one line. Also, the columns: each such instance is counted once for each line found.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking of the lines. Like in row0, positions 2 and 3 are same → counts as one line. How about in a larger case like if a row was 🌟🌟🌟→ that would have two lines of 2 and one line of 3, but in our count, we need to count each contiguous line once, but wait no, the problem may require that each maximal line is counted as a single line. Or perhaps it counts all possible sequences that are ≥2, but for a line like three same, that contains two parts: two in a row starting at position 0 and two in a row starting at position1. Wait wait, that's confusing.\n\nWait the question says, count the number of lines formed by the same emoji with length >=2. So is each maximal line counted once regardless of how many longer sequences are embedded in it?\n\nLooking at the problem statement: \"horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\"\n\nWait, the wording is ambiguous. Does each maximal contiguous line count as a single line, or each possible run of length ≥2?\n\nLike, for example, a row like 🌟🌟🌟🌟 would be one horizontal line of length4. But another viewpoint: how many lines? Well, a line is a set of connected, same emojis in a straight line, of at least length2.\n\nSo, each maximal contiguous segment counts as a single line if its length is ≥2. So in that case, for a row of four same emojis, it counts as one line.\n\nIn our problem, when looking for lines, each maximal run of 2 or more counts as one line. So multiple runs in a row\/column are counted as separate lines.\n\nWait, but let me see.\n\nFor example, in a row like 🌟🌟🍁🍁, this would be is two separate horizontal lines of length 2 each, so adding two lines.\n\nWait, no: the first two are same, then two same but different. So row has two lines.\n\nSo how to count? For each row or column, look for all possible contiguous runs of same emoji of length >=2, and each such run is a line that contributes +1 to the count, irrespective of other runs around it.\n\nSo perhaps I should approach it by, for each row, scanning and counting every run of length >=2 as a single line. Similarly for the columns.\n\nLet me recount the horizontal lines using this approach.\n\nTake Row 0: 🌟, 🌏, 🌟, 🌟.\n\nIn row0:\n\n🌟 is at position0.\n\nNext position1 is 🌏— different. So starting a new run.\n\nThen position2 is 🌟, same as position3=🌟. So one run of 2.\n\nSo for row0, 1 line.\n\nRow1: 🌏, 🌏, 🧽, 🍁.\n\nRow1 starts with two 🌏s. That's one run. The rest are different. So one line.\n\nRow2: 🌟, 🍁, 🌟, 🧽.\n\nEach cell is different from neighbors, so no runs.\n\nRow3: 🍁→🌟→🌏→🍁. All transitions are changes, so no runs.\n\nSo horizontal lines remain 2.\n\nNow, for vertical lines, let's check each column.\n\nColumn0:\n\npositions: 0:🌟, 1:🌏, 2:🌟, 3:🍁.\n\nLooking for runs:\n\n0 and1: 🌟 vs 🌏— different.\n\n1 and2: 🌏 vs 🌟— different.\n\n2 and3: 🌟 vs 🍁— different. So no runs → 0 lines.\n\nColumn1:\n\n0:🌏, 1:🌏, 2:🍁,3:🌟.\n\n0 and1: 🌏 and 🌏 → run of 2 → 1 line.\n\n1 and2: 🌏→🍁.\n\n2 and3: 🍁→🌟. So no other runs.\n\nSo column1 has 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn2:\n\nEntries: 🌟 (row0), 🧽 (row1), 🌟 (row2), 🌏 (row3).\n\nEach pair is different.\n\nSo no vertical lines.\n\nColumn3:\n\nEntries: 🌟 (row0), 🍁 (row1), 🧽 (row2), 🍁 (row3).\n\nRow3 is 🍁, row2 is 🧽.\n\nLooking between each:\n\n0 and1: 🌟→🍁.\n\n1 and2: 🍁→🧽.\n\n2 and3: 🧽→🍁.\n\nNo consecutive same runs. So column3 has 0 lines.\n\nSo vertical lines total 1.\n\nOverall, 2+1=3 lines.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing any longer runs. Like, in row0, the last two cells are same → that's one line. In column1, two same cells in a line → that's another. Any other lines?\n\nWait, looking at the board again, perhaps any other vertical lines.\n\nLooking at row3, column3 is 🍁. row3's column3 doesn't match row2's 🧽, so no. So nothing else.\n\nHence, the total is 3. So the answer is 3.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines on a 4x4 grid of emojis.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The board is made up of emojis arranged in rows. I need to count lines where two or more same emojis are adjacent either horizontally or vertically. Diagonals don't count, only horizontal and vertical directions.\n\nSo the board given is:\n\n🐛🦞🦞🐛\n🦢🐏🦢🐛\n🐏🐏🦞🐏\n🦞🦢🦢🦢\n\nEach row is a separate line. So the first thing I notice is that I need to check each possible line both horizontally and vertically.\n\nLet me represent each row as a list for easier processing.\n\nRow 0: 🐛, 🦞, 🦞, 🐛\nRow 1: 🦢, 🐏, 🦢, 🐛\nRow 2: 🐏, 🐏, 🦞, 🐏\nRow 3: 🦞, 🦢, 🦢, 🦢\n\nI think I should process each row to check for horizontal lines. Then I'll check each column for vertical lines.\n\nStarting with horizontal lines:\nFor each row, I'll scan through each emoji and see how many consecutive same emojis there are. For example, in row 0, the second and third emojis are 🦞🦞, which is a line of length 2. So that counts as 1.\n\nWait, but sometimes there might be longer lines. Like if there are 3 same in a row, that would count as one line of length 3, but I'm only counting lines with length 2 or more, regardless of how long they are, but each contiguous block counts as one. Or does it? Wait, no, wait. No, wait, if it's a longer line, each possible start and end of length>=2 counts as a separate line. Or is it that each maximum-length block is only counted once? I'm not sure.\n\nWait, wait. Let me re-read the problem. It says \"the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" Wait, perhaps each maximal run is counted as one line. Because if you have three same in a row, that's a single line of length 3. If I were to count all possible substrings, I might think overlapping ones, but the problem's wording suggests each maximal line counts once, because otherwise, for three that'd count as two lines (of length 2 and 3? Or does each consecutive pair count, so a run of 3 would have two lines of length 2 and one of length 3? Hmm, that's unclear.)\n\nWait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let's read the question again: \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So, each line is just any run where two or more same emojis are consecutive, and each run is a separate line, but perhaps only as a single unit.\n\nActually, perhaps it's considering each maximal run as a single line. For example, a row like AABBBCC would have a maximal run of AA, BBB, CC, each of which is longer or equal to 2. So the count is 3. Because each is one line.\n\nThat's probably the approach, to count each maximal run of same emojis as one line, regardless of their length (as long as it's 2+).\n\nSo for each row, I process each position, find all maximal consecutive same emojis, and if the length is >=2, add one to the count.\n\nSimilarly for columns.\n\nOkay, now process each row.\n\nRow 0: 🐛🦞🦞🐛\n- The first emoji is 🐛, single.\n- Next two are 🦞🦞, a run of 2. So count +=1.\n- Then 🐛, single.\n\nSo Row 0 contributes 1.\n\nRow1: 🦢🐏🦢🐛\n- 🦢 single.\n- 🐏 single.\n- 🦢 single.\n- 🐛 single.\nNo runs, so 0.\n\nRow2: 🐏🐏🦞🐏\n- First two 🐏🐏: run of 2. So count +=1.\n- Then 🦞, single.\n- 🐏, single.\nSo Row2 contributes 1.\n\nRow3: 🦞🦢🦢🦢\n- 🦞 single.\n- 🦢🦢🦢: run of 3. So count +=1.\nSo row3 contributes 1.\n\nSo total horizontal lines: 1+0+1+1 =3.\n\nNow check vertical lines. So for each column, go top to bottom.\n\nThere are 4 columns, 0 to 3.\n\nColumn0:\nRow0:🐛\nRow1:🦢\nRow2:🐏\nRow3:🦞\nAll different, no runs. So 0.\n\nColumn1:\nRow0:🦞\nRow1:🐏\nRow2:🐏\nRow3:🦢\nCheck for consecutive same.\n\nRow0 is 🦞 (row0), then row1:🐏, different.\nRow1:🐏, row2:🐏. So a run of 2. So count +=1.\nRow3:🦢, different from row2's 🐏.\n\nSo column1 contributes 1.\n\nColumn2:\nRow0: 🦞\nRow1:🦢\nRow2:🦞\nRow3:🦢\nRow0 is 🦞, row1:🦢: different.\nRow2:🦞, row3:🦢: different.\nNo runs, so 0.\n\nColumn3:\nRow0:🐛\nRow1:🐛\nRow2:🐏\nRow3:🦢\nRow0:🐛, row1:🐛: same, so run of 2. So count +=1.\nRow2 is 🐏, different.\nRow3 is 🦢, different.\n\nSo column3 contributes 1.\n\nAdding vertical lines: column1 (1) + column3 (1) = 2.\n\nSo total horizontal (3) + vertical (2) =5 lines.\n\nWait, so the total is 5? Let me recount to make sure.\n\nHorizontal:\n\nRow0: length 2: 1 line.\nRow1: none.\nRow2: length 2: 1.\nRow3: length 3: 1.\nTotal so far: 3.\n\nVertical:\nColumn0: none.\nColumn1: row1 and row2: same, two in row for a run of 2: 1.\nColumn2: none.\nColumn3: row0 and row1: same, run of 2:1.\nSo 2 vertical.\n\nTotal 3+2=5.\n\nBut wait, am I missing any in the vertical lines?\n\nWait, let me check again each column.\n\nColumn1: row1 is 🐏, row2 is 🐏.

{"board":[["🏄","🏄","🐧","🐧"],["🐠","🐧","🐧","🐧"],["🏄","🏄","🐧","🏄"],["🐠","🏄","🐠","🐆"]],"response":["<think>\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have a rectangular board made up of emojis. The task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more. Let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a horizontal or vertical line is here. A horizontal line means the same emoji appears consecutively in the same row from left to right. Similarly, a vertical line means the same emoji appears consecutively in the same column from top to bottom. Each occurrence of such lines with two or more same emojis counts as one line. So, if a row has four same emojis in a row, that's one line, not two or three.\n\nWait, no. Wait, I might be misunderstanding. Do overlapping sequences count separately? For example, the sequence A A A would count parts of it as lines. Like, the first two, then the second two. But maybe the problem counts the maximum possible? Or maybe each run counts once irrespective of the length as long as it's at least two.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: It says lines formed by same emojis, with length 2 or more. So each line is a consecutive run in a row or column. Each run is counted once for each direction it appears. So, in the example, if a row has three same emojis, that's one horizontal line, not two (because it's one run of length three, which is longer than two). Similarly, a vertical line is a run in a column, so the same applies there.\n\nSo, my approach will be:\n\n1. For each row, check horizontal runs.\n2. For each column, check vertical runs.\n3. Total the number of such runs.\n\nLet me try to parse the given board correctly. The board is given as:\n\n🏄🏄🐧🐧\n🐠🐧🐧🐧\n🏄🏄🐧🏄\n🐠🏄🐠🐆\n\nEach line is a row with four elements. So there are 4 rows and 4 columns.\n\nLet's write it row-wise for clarity:\n\nRow 0: 🏄, 🏄, 🐧, 🐧\nRow 1: 🐠, 🐧, 🐧, 🐧\nRow 2: 🏄, 🏄, 🐧, 🏄\nRow 3: 🐠, 🏄, 🐠, 🐆\n\nNow, let's process each row for horizontal lines.\n\nRow 0: \nStart from the first element. 🏄, next is 🏄. So run length of 2 in same direction. So that counts as a horizontal line. Then, next elements are 🐧, 🐧, another run of 2. So that's two horizontal lines in this row.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, the first two are 🏄🏄, then the next two are 🐧🐧. Each run is a separate line. So row 0 has two horizontal lines.\n\nRow 1:\nStarts with 🐠, next is 🐧. Different, so no line. Then next three are 🐧🐧🐧. That's a run of three, which is ≥2. So that's one horizontal line.\n\nRow 2:\nElements: 🏄, 🏄, 🐧, 🏄.\nFirst two are 🏄🏄: that's a run of 2, so one horizontal line. Then 🐧 is single, then 🏄 is single. So row 2 contributes one.\n\nRow 3:\n🐠, 🏄, 🐠, 🐆. All are single elements, no run of two or more.\n\nNow, the horizontal lines:\n\nRow 0: 2\nRow 1: 1\nRow 2:1\nRow3:0\nTotal horizontal = 2+1+1=4.\n\nNow vertical lines. Let's process each column.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow0: 🏄\nRow1: 🐠\nRow2: 🏄\nRow3: 🐠\nLooking for consecutive same emojis down the column.\n\nPositions 0,1,2: 🏄, 🐠 (different). Next positions 1,2: 🐠 and 🏄, different. Position 2,3: 🏄, 🐠: different. So no vertical lines here.\n\nWait, column 0 is [🏄, 🐠, 🏄, 🐠]. No consecutive runs of two or more.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow0: 🏄\nRow1: 🐧\nRow2: 🏄\nRow3: 🏄\n\nCheck for runs. Let's look down:\n\nRow0 to row1: 🏄 to 🐧: different.\n\nRow1 to row2: 🐧 to 🏄: different.\n\nRow2 to row3: 🏄 to 🏄: same. Two consecutive, so that's a vertical line of length two. So that's one vertical line.\n\nSo column 1 contributes 1.\n\nIs there anything else in the column? Let's see.\n\nRow0 and row1: different. Row1 to row2: different. Rwo2 to row3: same. So only one.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow0: 🐧\nRow1: 🐧\nRow2: 🐧\nRow3: 🐠\n\nLooking for runs down each pair.\n\nRow0 to row1: 🐧🐧: same. Length 2, so that's a run of two.\n\nContinuing for longer runs:\n\nRow0-1 is two, which counts. Then row1 to row2: 🐧🐧, same, so that makes a run of three (rows 0,1,2 are all 🐧). Wait but each vertical run is consecutive in the column.\n\nWait wait wait no. Vertical runs would be consecutive in the column. So for column2:\n\nRow0: 🐧\n\nRow1: 🐧 --> same as row0. So run starts at 0 with length 2.\n\nRow1: same as row0 so current run is now 2.\n\nThen row2: 🐧 same as row1. So the run is now 3.\n\nAnd row3: 🐠, which is different.\n\nSo in column2, it's a single run that starts at row0, row1, row2, and ends before row3. So the length is 3, which is ≥2, so it's one vertical line. So column2 contributes 1.\n\nWait, no. Because in column2, the three consecutive 🐧s form a single run of length 3, which counts as a single vertical line. But originally, I thought of it as all three contributing, but the problem counts contiguous runs as one per run, regardless of how long.\n\nSo, in column2, run from row0 to row2: length 3, counts as one vertical line.\n\nIs there any more? Like row1-row2 could be a run, but since they are part of the longer run, we count it once.\n\nSo, column2 contributes 1.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🐧\nRow1: 🐧\nRow2: 🏄\nRow3: 🐆\n\nCheck for runs. Let's see the transitions:\n\nRow0 to row1: 🐧 to 🐧: same. So a run of 2. Then row1 to row2: 🐧 to 🏄: different. Are there any more runs?\n\nRow2 to row3: 🏄 to 🐆: different. So the only run here is row0-1, which is two consecutive, so that's one vertical line.\n\nSo column3 contributes one.\n\nTherefore, the vertical lines are column1 has 1 (rows2-3), column2 has 1, column3 has 1. So total vertical lines: 3.\n\nWait, wait, let me re-check column 3.\n\nIn column3:\n\nRow0: 🐧\n\nRow1: 🐧 --> same as row0 (two in a row, counts as one).\n\nRow2: 🏄 --> different, so run ends at row1.\n\nRow3: 🐆 --> different.\n\nSo column3 has a run of two, which counts once.\n\nSo, vertical lines total 1 (column1) + 1 (column2) +1 (column3) =3.\n\nWait, wait, but in column2, the vertical run is 3 which is one line.\n\nSo, vertical lines: 1 +1+1 =3.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I processed column 2, the run is from rows0-1-2: that's a single run, which counts as one line.\n\nSo, from all columns, column 0 has none, column1 has 1, column2 1, column3 1. So 3 vertical lines.\n\nSo total vertical lines: 3.\n\nAdding up, horizontal lines:4 + vertical lines:3 =7.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any.\n\nLet me recheck each row's horizontal lines.\n\nRow0: 🏄🏄 followed by 🐧🐧. So, two runs of 2 each: two lines.\n\nNo more, because it's four emojis, in two separate runs.\n\nRow0: two horizontal lines.\n\nRow1: runs. I think in row1, it's 🐠 followed by three 🐧s. So a run of three: one line.\n\nRow2: 🏄🏄, followed by 🐧, 🏄. So run of two in the first two, so one line.\n\nRow3: nothing.\n\nSo horizontal lines: 2+1+1 =4. That's correct.\n\nVertical lines:\n\nColumn0: no runs. So 0.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow0: 🏄\n\nRow1: 🐧\n\nRow2: 🏄\n\nRow3: 🏄 --> so in the column, only rows 2 and 3 are same (🏄🏄). So a two-run at the bottom. So one line.\n\nColumn2:\n\nThree 🐧s in rows0,1,2, so one line.\n\nColumn3:\n\nTwo 🐧s in row0 and 1, so one line.\n\nSo 1+1+1=3.\n\nYes, same as earlier.\n\nSo total lines:4+3=7.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me make sure I didn't double-count the column runs.\n\nLet me list all vertical lines:\n\n- Column1: rows2-3 (🏄🏄): 1 line.\n\n- Column2: rows0-1-2 (🐧🐧🐧):1 line.\n\n- Column3: rows0-1 (🐧🐧):1 line.\n\nYes, that's three.\n\nNow, are there any other vertical runs? Let's check column0 again.\n\nRow0,1,2,3 in column0: 🏄, 🐠, 🏄, 🐠. No consecutive same, so no runs.\n\nSo yes, 3 vertical lines.\n\nWait, what about columns where maybe there are runs of two in other positions? For example, in column3, rows0-1: 🐧🐧 (contributes 1), and perhaps if another run in the same column beyond. Like, if in another part of the column.\n\nLike, perhaps if in column3, there was a run starting at row3 and row4, but it's the end. So no.\n\nSo, columns:\n\n- column0: 0\n\n- column1:1\n\n- column2:1\n\n- column3:1\n\nTotal 3.\n\nSo 4+3=7.\n\nWait, so the answer is 7.\n\nLet me double-check each row and column to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused. Another way to approach this: make a grid and visually check each possible run.\n\nLet me represent the board as a grid for easier checking:\n\nRow 0: 🏄 🏄 🐧 🐧\n\nRow 1: 🐠 🐧 🐧 🐧\n\nRow 2: 🏄 🏄 🐧 🏄\n\nRow3: 🐠 🏄 🐠 🐆.\n\nFor each row, look for horizontal runs.\n\nRow 0: 🏄🏄 is run of 2. 🐧🐧 is run of 2. So two lines.\n\nRow1: 🐠 is single. Then 🐧🐧🐧: run of 3. So one line.\n\nRow2: 🏄🏄 (run of 2), followed by 🐧🏄, both single. So down to one line.\n\nRow3: 🐠 followed by 🏄🐠🐆: all single. So nothing.\n\nSo total horizontal lines: 2+1+1=4.\n\nNow vertical lines.\n\nColumn0: check each possible pair:\n\nRow0 🏄, Row1 🐠: different.\n\nRow1 🐠, Row2 🏄: different.\n\nRow2 🏄, Row3 🐠: differen. So no vertical lines.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow0 🏄, Row1 🐧: differ.\n\nRow1 🐧, row2 🏄: diff.\n\nRow2 🏄, row3 🏄: same—run of two. So yes, one line.\n\nColumn2:\n\nrow0 🐧, row1 🐧: same—run starts, continues to row2 🐧. So that's a run of three: one line.\n\nColumn3:\n\nrow0 🐧, row1 🐧: same—run of two.\n\nrows1 🐧, row2 🏄: different.\n\nrows2 🏄, row3 🐆: different. So one run.\n\nSo vertical lines: 1 in col1, one in col2 (3 in a row doesn't add more), one in col3. So three.\n\nSo total lines: 4+3=7.\n\nHmm. So the answer would be 7.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more, on a given 4x4 rectangular board.

{"board":[["🦇","🤚","🌾","🌾"],["🤚","🌾","🦇","🌾"],["🌾","🐘","🤚","🤚"],["🤚","🌾","🐘","🤚"]],"response":["<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I have a rectangular board made of emojis, and I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of two or more. The goal is to find the total count of such lines.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the board. The board is given as four rows:\n\nRow 1: 🦇 🤚 🌾 🌾\n\nRow 2: 🤚 🌾 🦇 🌾\n\nRow 3: 🌾 🐘 🤚 🤚\n\nRow 4: 🤚 🌾 🐘 🤚\n\nI'm going to represent each row as a list for easier processing. Let's break it down:\n\nRow 1: ['🦇', '🤚', '🌾', '🌾']\nRow 2: ['🤚', '🌾', '🦇', '🌾']\nRow 3: ['🌾', '🐘', '🤚', '🤚']\nRow 4: ['🤚', '🌾', '🐘', '🤚']\n\nI think the approach is to scan each row horizontally and each column vertically to find consecutive same emojis of length 2 or more. But wait, I also need to make sure that for longer lines, I don't count overlapping sections multiple times. For example, if there's a line of 4 same emojis, it contributes two lines: length 3 and 4? Wait, no, the problem says to count each line of same emojis, with length >=2. So a line of 4 same emojis would contribute three lines of length 2 (positions 1-2, 2-3, 3-4), but wait, no. Wait the problem says the line must consist of two or more same in a row. So whether these lines are continuous, perhaps considering each maximal contiguous sequence as one line. For example, four in a row is a single line of length four, not three separate lines of two. Oh, I think that's probably the case.\n\nWait the problem says: \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So a continuous sequence. So each maximal run counts as one if it's >=2. Because in a run of four same emojis, it's all connected in one line, not multiple separate lines. So for example:\n\nThe third row is 🌾 🐘 🤚 🤚. So the last two are 🤚, which is a line of length 2. So that counts as one.\n\nSimilarly, looking back at my initial thought process, perhaps each row needs to be scanned for contiguous same emojis, and each of these runs is one line if they have length >=2.\n\nSo each such run counts as one horizontal line. Similarly, for vertical lines, each run where two or more emojis are same vertically would count as one.\n\nSo I need to process each row and each column, looking for consecutive same emojis.\n\nLet me process horizontally first.\n\nRow 1:\nPositions:\n0: 🦇\n1: 🤚\n2: 🌾\n3: 🌾\n\nLooking for consecutive same emojis.\n\nComparing 0 with 1: different. 1 with 2: different. 2 and 3: same. So 🌾 appears twice. So that's a horizontal line of length 2. So count 1.\n\nRow 2: 🤚, 🌾, 🦇, 🌾\nElements 0-3.\n\n0-1: different. 1-2: different. 2-3: 🦇 vs 🌾: different. So nothing here. So 0 horizontal lines.\n\nRow 3: 🌾, 🐘, 🤚, 🤚.\n\nBetween 2 and3: same. So another horizontal line of length 2. Count 1.\n\nRow4: 🤚, 🌾, 🐘, 🤚.\n\nLooking:\n\n0 to1: different.\n\n1 to2: different.\n\n2 to3: no, since 3 is 🤚 while 2 is 🐘.\n\nSo no horizontal lines in row4.\n\nSo horizontal lines count is: row1:1, row3:1. So total horizontal lines so far: 2.\n\nWhat about vertical lines? Now I need to process each column from top to bottom, looking for consecutive same emojis.\n\nThere are 4 columns (0,1,2,3).\n\nLet's index as [row][col], with row from 0 to3.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow0: 🦇\nRow1: 🤚\nRow2: 🌾\nRow3: 🤚\n\nAre there any consecutive same emojis in this column?\n\nRow0 and 1: different.\n\nRow1 and 2: 🤚 to 🌾: different.\n\nRow2 and3: 🌾 to 🤚: different.\n\nSo nothing in column0.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow0: 🤚\n\nRow1: 🌾\n\nRow2: 🐘\n\nRow3: 🌾\n\nLooking between each pair:\n\nRow0 to1: different.\n\nRow1 to2: 🌾 to 🐘: different.\n\nRow2 to3: 🐘 to 🌾: different.\n\nSo no vertical lines here.\n\nWait maybe longer runs elsewhere.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: 🌾\n\nRow1: 🦇\n\nRow2: 🤚\n\nRow3: 🐘\n\nChecking:\n\nRow0 vs row1: 🌾 vs 🦇: different.\n\nRow1 vs row2: 🦇 vs 🤚: different.\n\nRow2 vs row3: 🤚 vs 🐘: different.\n\nNo lines here.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🌾\n\nRow1: 🌾\n\nRow2: 🤚\n\nRow3: 🤚\n\nSo let's check each row:\n\nrow0: 🌾, row1: 🌾. So same. So that's a vertical line of length 2. Count 1.\n\nrows1 and2: 🌾 vs 🤚: different.\n\nrows2 and3: 🤚, same. So another vertical line starting at row2, so count 1.\n\nSo in column3, we have two separate vertical lines of length 2. So that's 2.\n\nSo vertical lines: 2.\n\nNow, combining horizontal (2) and vertical (2), the total lines would be 4.\n\nWait wait, but I think I might have missed some vertical lines, need to recheck.\n\nLet's re-examine column3:\n\nrow0: 🌾\n\nrow1: 🌾 → same as row0. So a vertical line of 2.\n\nrow1 is 🌾, row2 is 🤚 → different.\n\nrow2 is 🤚, row3 is 🤚: same. So another vertical line of 2.\n\nSo column3 has 2 vertical lines.\n\nBut, wait, does that cover all possible vertical lines?\n\nIn that column, each occurrence where consecutive rows are same. So yes.\n\nSo vertical lines contribute 2.\n\nSo total lines so far: horizontal 2, vertical 2 → total 4.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's recount.\n\nLooking back:\n\nHorizontal lines:\n\nRow1 (index 0): [🦇, 🤚, 🌾, 🌾] → the last two are same, so 1.\n\nRow3 (index 2): [🌾, 🐘, 🤚, 🤚] → last two same: 1.\n\nSo 2 horizontal lines.\n\nVertical lines:\n\nColumn3: row0-1: same, row2-3: same. That's 2 vertical lines.\n\nWait, are there any other columns with vertical lines?\n\nLet's check column1 again.\n\nHmm, row3 in column1 is 🌾. Wait, no, let me re-examine. Wait no, initial analysis showed nothing in column1. Correct.\n\nAnother thought: maybe some vertical lines are longer than 2. Let me check.\n\nFor example, checking column3:\n\nRows 0 and 1 have two 🌾, but rows 2 and 3 have two 🤚. So no longer than 2.\n\nSo each vertical line is a separate run of 2. So total vertical: 2.\n\nSo sum is 2 + 2 =4.\n\nWait but wait! Are there any diagonal lines? Wait no, because the problem says only horizontal or vertical lines. So diagonals don't count.\n\nWhat about the other columns?\n\nLet me reevaluate all columns:\n\nColumn 0: rows are 🦇, 🤚, 🌾, 🤚.\n\nSo row0 is 🦇;1: 🤚 (different). 2: 🌾, 3: 🤚. So no same consecutive.\n\nColumn1: as before.\n\nColumn2: row0: 🌾, row1: 🦇, row2: 🤚, row3: 🐘. All different when looking at adjacent. So no vertical lines here.\n\nColumn3: as before. So 2 vertical lines contribute.\n\nAny other vertical runs?\n\nWait, another idea: Let's check column0 again.\n\nrow0: 🦇\n\nrow1: 🤚\n\nNo.\n\nWait, perhaps in column2, row 0 is 🌾, row1 is 🦇, row2 is 🤚, row3 is 🐘. So no.\n\nNow, considering I might have missed horizontal or vertical lines, but let's proceed.\n\nSo count is 4 so far. But wait, wait: re-examining row2: [🌾, 🐘, 🤚, 🤚]. So the last two are same, yes. 1 horizontal line.\n\nAnother potential spot: row3, column0 is 🤚, row4 (wait no, row0 is row 0). Wait, let's see, okay.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in vertical lines in other columns. Let me check if any other columns have longer runs.\n\nWait another idea: Let's create a grid structure and process each cell horizontally and vertically.\n\nAlternatively, another approach:\n\nWe can create a grid in code, and for each cell, check right and down to see if same emojis follow. But since I can't write code here, I'll simulate it.\n\nBut perhaps for our problem, let's look for all possible runs of same emojis, whether horizontally or vertically, >=2. Each such run counts as one line.\n\nWait, but perhaps in a longer run, multiple lines can be formed. For instance, if four same emojis are in a row, that's just one line of 4, but counted once here.\n\nNow, going back to the problem, the question is whether each maximal run counts once.\n\nI think that's correct because a line is a contiguous sequence of same emojis, of length >=2.\n\nSo, for example, a horizontal run of 3 same emojis would contribute one line to the count.\n\nSo let me process all the rows and columns again, but now considering the length also.\n\nSo, let's redo the analysis for both horizontal and vertical lines, considering each maximal run as one line.\n\nStarting with horizontal lines:\n\nRow 0:\n\nCells 0: 🦇, 1: 🤚 → different.\n\nCells 1: 🤚, 2: 🌾 → different.\n\nCells 2: 🌾, 3: 🌾 → same. So run length is 2. So count 1.\n\nRow 1:\n\nNo consecutive same in any longer runs. So nothing.\n\nRow2:\n\nCells 0: 🌾, 1: 🐘 → different.\n\nCells 1: 🐘,2: 🤚 → different.\n\nCells 2: 🤚,3: 🤚 → same. So run of 2, count 1.\n\nSo in horizontal lines, total is 2.\n\nNow, vertical lines.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow 0: 🦇.\n\nRow1: 🤚 → not same.\n\nRow2: 🌾 → not same as row0.\n\nRow3: 🤚 → not same as row2.\n\nSo no runs.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow0: 🤚.\n\nRow1: 🌾 → different.\n\nRow2: 🐘 → different.\n\nRow3: 🌾 → different.\n\nSo no runs.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow0: 🌾.\n\nRow1: 🦇 → different.\n\nRow2: 🤚 → different.\n\nRow3: 🐘 → different.\n\nNo runs.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🌾.\n\nRow1: 🌾 → same as row0. So run length 2. Count 1.\n\nRow2: 🤚.\n\nRow3: 🤚 → same. So run length 2. Count 1.\n\nSo vertical lines: 2.\n\nWait, but what about rows below? Are there any longer runs elsewhere?\n\nIn row2, column2,3: same but already counted.\n\nSo up to now, total count is horizontal(2)+vertical(2)=4.\n\nWait, no, wait. Are there any other vertical or horizontal runs?\n\nAnother possibility: Let me check for other columns.\n\nWait, in column 0, rows:\n\nrow3 is 🤚, but row4 doesn't exist, so column0 only has four elements.\n\nNo, nothing else.\n\nHmm.\n\nBut I have a feeling I'm forgetting something. Let me re-examine the grid.\n\nRow 1:\n\nCells: 🤚 🌾 🦇 🌾.\n\nSo for horizontal:\n\n🤚 vs 🌾: different.\n\n🌾 vs 🦇: different.\n\n🦇 vs 🌾: different.\n\nSo nothing.\n\nSo recounting, horizontal has 2 lines.\n\nNow for vertical lines, perhaps in columns:\n\nLet me go through each column again.\n\nColumn0:\n\nrow0: 🦇, row1: 🤚 → different.\n\nrow1: 🤚, row2: 🌾 → different.\n\nrow2: 🌾, row3: 🤚 → different.\n\nNo runs.\n\nColumn1:\n\nrow0: 🤚, row1: 🌾 → same as cipher? No.\n\nWait row0 is 🤚, row1 in column1 is 🌾.\n\nSo row0 and row1 are different.\n\nRow1 (col1): 🌾.\n\nrow2 in column1: 🐘 → different.\n\nrow3, column1: 🌾 → different from row2.\n\nNo runs.\n\nColumn2:\n\nrow0: 🌾.\n\nrow1: 🦇 → different.\n\nrow2: 🤚 → different from row1.\n\nrow3: 🐘 → different from row2.\n\nSo no runs.\n\nColumn3:\n\nAs above, rows 0-1: 🌾,🌾 → run.\n\nrows2-3: 🤚, 🤚 → run.\n\nSo 2 runs, vertical.\n\nThat's 2 for vertical.\n\nPutting it together: 2 horizontal +2 vertical =4.\n\nBut wait, maybe I have an error in row1.\n\nRow1: 🤚 🌾 🦇 🌾.\n\nWait, let's check the first two elements: 🤚 and 🌾 → are they same? No. Next two: 🌾 and 🦇: no. Then 🦇 and 🌾: no. So in row1, no horizontal lines.\n\nNow, checking vertical column0 again.\n\nWait, perhaps in row3, column3, what's the data?\n\nRow3 has 🤚 in column3 (since the board is four columns). So in column3:\n\nrow0: 🌾\n\nrow1: 🌾 → same as row0, so run of 2.\n\nrow2: 🤚 → different.\n\nrow3: 🤚 → same as row2, so another run.\n\nSo yes, 2 in column3.\n\nSo total vertical lines:2.\n\nHmm. So that seems to give a total of 4 lines.\n\nBut let me think if I missed any other possible runs.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to look for runs in horizontal and columns. Maybe I missed longer runs.\n\nWait, for example, in column3, row0 and row1 form a run (2) and row2 and row3 form another run (2). So that's two runs in vertical for column3.\n\nWait, what about row0, column3: 🌾.\n\nRow1: 🌾.\n\nRow2: 🤚.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check for larger runs beyond two.\n\nWait, in this case, rows 0-1: two in vertical. So that's a run of 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the total lines are four.\n\nSo the answer should be 4.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji on a rectangular board, where each line has a length of 2 or more.

{"board":[["🌍","🐦","🌍","🌘"],["🌵","🌍","🌵","🌵"],["🌵","🌍","🌘","🐦"],["🐦","🌘","🌘","🌵"]],"response":["<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. Okay, so the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines on a rectangular board made up of emojis. Each line must be formed by the same emoji and have a length of at least 2. Hmm, I should probably look at each row and column carefully to spot these lines.\n\nFirst, let me write down the board so I can visualize it better. I'll represent each row as a list or something.\n\nThe board is:\n\nRow 0: 🌍 🐦 🌍 🌘\nRow 1: 🌵 🌍 🌵 🌵\nRow 2: 🌵 🌍 🌘 🐦\nRow 3: 🐦 🌘 🌘 🌵\n\nWait, each row has four elements. So four columns in each row.\n\nI think I'll start by checking each row for horizontal lines, and then I'll move on to the columns for vertical lines.\n\nLet's break it down.\n\nHorizontal lines:\n\nLooking row by row.\n\nRow 0: 🌍 🐦 🌍 🌘\n\nCheck for consecutive same emojis. The first two are 🌍 and 🐦. Different. Next is 🌍—different from 🐦. Then 🌘. So no horizontal lines here.\n\nRow 1: 🌵 🌍 🌵 🌵\n\nCheck each adjacent pair. 🌵 and 🌍: different. 🌍 and 🌵: different. Then 🌵 and 🌵: same. So that's a line of length 2.\n\nSo that's one line.\n\nRow 2: 🌵 🌍 🌘 🐦\n\nChecking adjacent pairs: 🌵 vs 🌍: no. 🌍 vs 🌘: no. 🌘 vs 🐦: no. So no lines here.\n\nRow 3: 🐦 🌘 🌘 🌵\n\nFirst two: 🐦 vs 🌘—different. Then 🌘 vs 🌘: same, that's a line of 2. Then 🌘 vs 🌵: different. So another line here.\n\nSo for horizontal lines, I have one in row 1 (length 2) and one in row 3 (length 2). So that's 2 horizontal lines.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. What's about longer lines? For example, if three same emojis in a row, that would count as two lines (the middle can overlap). Or maybe each segment of 2 or more counts as a separate line, but perhaps each consecutive same is considered.\n\nWait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So each maximum consecutive run is counted as a single line. So for a run of 3, it's a single line of length 3, not two lines of length 2 each.\n\nWait, but in terms of how I'm supposed to count them, am I supposed to consider every possible consecutive segment that is at least length 2? For example, a row like AAA would contribute two lines: the first two, and the last two. Or just one line of length 3.\n\nThe problem statement says \"lines of length 2 or more.\" So I think that any consecutive sequence of 2 or more same emojis in a straight line counts as one line, regardless of overlapping. So, for example:\n\nIn a row like AAB, then there's a line of AA—length 2. If it's AAA, the entire is a line of length 3. But in a case like AAAB (4 same), then it's a line of length 4, but not multiple lines.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. I think the problem is looking for the number of lines, each consisting of two or more identical emojis. So, every maximal run in a row contributes one line per run, as long as the run's length is >=2.\n\nSo, in row 1: the last three are 🌵🌵🌵. So that's a single line (length 3), counting as 1.\n\nIn row 3: the middle two are 🌘🌘, that's another single line. So horizontal lines are 2.\n\nNo other rows have lines, right?\n\nWait, let me recheck row 0: no, row 2: no.\n\nSo 2 horizontal lines.\n\nNow, onto vertical lines. Check each column for consecutive same emojis.\n\nLet's look column by column, across all four rows.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow 0: 🌍\nRow 1: 🌵\nRow 2: 🌵\nRow 3: 🐦\n\nSo column 0: 🌍, 🌵, 🌵, 🐦. First pair: 🌍 vs 🌵: different. Next, 🌵 and 🌵: same. That's a line of length 2. So one line.\n\nThen, 🌵 and 🐦: different. So total of 1 vertical line in column 0.\n\nWait wait, looking vertically: is that consecutive?\n\nRow 1 is 🌵, row 2 is 🌵: same, so that's a vertical run of 2. So that's a count of 1.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow 0: 🐦\nRow 1: 🌍\nRow 2: 🌍\nRow 3: 🌘\n\nSo row 0: 🐦, row1: 🌍: different. row1 to row2: same 🌍, so a run of 2, so 1 line. Is there another in column 1?\n\nRow2 is 🌍, row3 is 🌘: different. So the run of row1-2 gives a vertical line of length 2.\n\nSo that's another line—so count as 1.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow0: 🌍\nRow1: 🌵\nRow2: 🌘\nRow3: 🌘\n\nCheck row0 to row1: different. row1 (🌵) to row2 (🌘): different. row2 to row3: 🌘 same as row3—no, wait row2 is 🌘, row3 is 🌘.\n\nWait no, row2: 🌘, row3: 🌘 in column 2? Let me check the board.\n\nWait the board is: each line represents a row.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow 0 is 🌍🐦🌍🌘 (so columns 0-3)\nRow 1: 🌵🌍🌵🌵\nRow2: 🌵🌍🌘🐦 (so column 2 in row2 is 🌘)\nRow3: 🐦🌘🌘🌵: column 2 in row3 is 🌘, column 3 is 🌵.\n\nSo column2 has row 0: 🌍, row1: 🌵, row2: 🌘, row3: 🌘.\n\nSo in column2, row2 and row3 are both 🌘. So that's a vertical line of length 2. Another line, count as +1.\n\nSo column2: 1 line.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow 0: 🌘\nRow1: 🌵\nRow2: 🐦\nRow3: 🌵\n\nCheck each pair:\n\n🌘 to 🌵: different.\n\n🌵 to 🐦: different.\n\n🐦 to 🌵: different.\n\nSo no vertical lines here.\n\nSo adding it all up:\n\nVertical lines: column0 has 1, column1 has 1, column2 has 1. Total of 3.\n\nWait wait, am I missing something? Let me recount.\n\nWait column0: row1 and row2 are same. So count 1.\n\nColumn1: row1 and row2 are same, another count 1.\n\nColumn2: row2 and row3 are same; count 1.\n\nColumn3: no lines.\n\nTotal vertical lines: 3.\n\nSo overall lines: horizontal (2) + vertical (3) = 5.\n\nWait, earlier when I thought the horizontal lines only count 2, vertical 3—total 5.\n\nWait wait, let me make sure.\n\nWait in horizontal, row1: the last three are 🌵🌵🌵, that's a run of length 3—counts as 1 line.\n\nIn row3, column1 and 2 are 🌘, so one line.\n\nWait, no, I'm probably confusing rows and columns. Let's recheck.\n\nRow0: 🌍 🐦 🌍 🌘 → no lines.\n\nRow1: 🌵 🌍 🌵 🌵 → run is 🌵🌵🌵, so one line.\n\nRow2: 🌵 🌍 🌘 🐦 → no.\n\nRow3: 🐦 🌘 🌘 🌵: in columns 1 and 2: same (🌘🌘). So yes, line length 2.\n\nSo horizontal lines: 2 lines.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated. So in row1, the run is 3 emojis, counts as one line. So that's one, and row3's run is 2, another one, bringing horizontal count to 2.\n\nWait correct.\n\nVertical lines:\n\nColumn0: row1 🌵, row2 🌵 → one.\n\nColumn1: row1 🌍, row2 🌍 → one.\n\nColumn2: row2 🌘, row3 🌘 → one.\n\nSo 3 lines.\n\nSo total lines: 2 + 3 =5. So the answer is 5.\n\nWait, but I initially thought the horizontal count was 2. Let me double-check.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the horizontal lines I considered are only 2. Let's think again.\n\nWait the horizontal lines in row1: the last three 🌵🌵🌵, so one line—so count as 1.\n\nRow3: 🐦 🌘 🌘 🌵 → only one line: the two 🌘 in the middle. So that's another, making 2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nHow about vertical lines: column0's two, column1's two, column2's two. So three lines.\n\nThus total 5 lines.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines on a rectangular board made up of emojis.

{"board":[["🐅","🌼","🌼","🐅"],["🐅","🐳","🐅","🐅"],["🌼","🐅","🌼","🐅"],["🐅","🌲","🌼","🌲"]],"response":["<think>\nOkay, I've got to figure out how to solve this problem. Let me read the question carefully. So, the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines on a 4x4 emoji board where the same emoji repeats two or more times consecutively. \n\nThe board given is as follows:\n\n🐅🌼🌼🐅\n🐅🐳🐅🐅\n🌼🐅🌼🐅\n🐅🌲🌼🌲\n\nI need to look for lines of 2 or more emojis. These can be either horizontal, meaning in the same row, or vertical, meaning in the same column. Each such line counts as one, regardless of how long it is, as long as it's two or more. So, for example, if a row has a sequence of 3 same emojis, that counts as one line.\n\nFirst, I should probably break down each row and column to examine them one by one.\n\nLet's start with the horizontal lines.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: 🐅, 🌼, 🌼, 🐅\n\nI see that the second and third emojis are both 🌼, so that's a horizontal line of length 2. Also, does the first and last 🐅 count as separate lines? Well, they are single, so no. So row 1 contributes 1 line.\n\nRow 2: 🐅, 🐳, 🐅, 🐅\n\nHere, at the end, the third and fourth are 🐅, so another horizontal line. So row 2 adds 1 line.\n\nRow 3: 🌼, 🐅, 🌼, 🐅\n\nNo consecutive duplicates in a row here. So row 3 contributes 0.\n\nRow 4: 🐅, 🌲, 🌼, 🌲\n\nHmm, the last two are 🌲 and 🌼? Wait wait, no, it's 🌼 and 🌲. Wait, let's recheck:\n\nRow 4 is 🐅 🌲 🌼 🌲. So looking at each position: \n\n- Position 1: 🐅.\n- Position 2: 🌲.\n- Position 3: 🌼.\n- Position 4: 🌲.\n\nWait, from position 2 to 4: position 2 is 🌲, position 3 is 🌼, and 4 is 🌲. So the only thing is that position 4 is the same as position 2, but they're not consecutive. So, in row 4, the only possible consecutive is 2 and 3: 🌲 and 🌼? No, they're different. So row 4 has no horizontal lines.\n\nSo in total, from the rows, we have 1 (row1) + 1 (row2) = 2 horizontal lines.\n\nWait, wait, no. Because each row might have more than one line, but I'm considering only consecutive ones as a single line. Wait, no, wait each line per row is per consecutive group.\n\nWait, for a single row, like row1: 🐅🌼🌼🐅, the 🌼🌼 is one line, right? So total lines per row are determined by how many runs of 2+ same emojis there are. So for each row, if there are multiple such runs, they each count as a separate line. So, for example, if a row was 🌼🌼🐅🐅, that's two separate lines in the same row. So each row might contribute multiple lines.\n\nWait, but in the rows I looked at, each row only has one line or none.\n\nSo in row1, the 🌼s are two, so one line.\n\nWait, no, have I made a mistake? Let me look again.\n\nWait, in the problem statement: a horizontal or vertical line formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more. So, in each direction (horizontal and vertical) the runs of same emojis of length >=2 are counted.\n\nSo, for each row, you count the number of horizontal lines in that row. Each run of >=2 same emojis counts as a line. Similarly for columns.\n\nSo, lines longer than 2 (like 3 same emojis) count as a single line.\n\nLet's begin by examining each row:\n\nRow 1:\n🐅, 🌼, 🌼, 🐅 → The 🌼🌼 is a run of 2 → 1 line.\n\nRow 2:\n🐅, 🐳, 🐅, 🐅 → the last two are 🐅🐅 → run of 2 → 1 line.\n\nRow 3:\n🌼, 🐅, 🌼, 🐅 → No runs of 2, so 0 lines.\n\nRow 4:\n🐅, 🌲, 🌼, 🌲 → Check each position:\n\nPosition 1: 🐅.\n\nPosition 2: 🌲. Compare with next: position3 is 🌼, no. So no run.\n\nPosition 3: 🌼. Next is position4 (🌲). Different.\n\nSo row4 contributes 0.\n\nSo horizontal lines sum up to: 1 +1 = 2 lines so far.\n\nNow, check the vertical lines: look at each column, check runs.\n\nThere are four columns, each of four rows.\n\nColumn 1: Emojis are 🐅, 🐅, 🌼, 🐅.\n\nLet's see:\n\nRow1: 🐅\n\nRow2: 🐅 → same as row1.\n\nRow3: 🌼 → different.\n\nRow4: 🐅 → same as row1. But check runs.\n\nSo in column1:\n\nRow1 and Row2: 🐅🐅 → a run of at least 2 → that's one line.\n\nRow2 is 🐅, row3 is 🌼: no. But row4 is 🐅, which is same as row1 and row2? Wait, no. Because row4 comes after row3, which is different. So in column1, from row1 and row2, two in a row → count as one line. then row4 is a single again. So column1 adds 1 line.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow1: 🌼.\n\nRow2: 🐳.\n\nRow3: 🐅.\n\nRow4: 🌲.\n\nNo consecutive runs of 2 in column2. So 0 lines.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow1: 🌼.\n\nRow2: 🐅.\n\nRow3: 🌼.\n\nRow4: 🌼?\n\nWait, let me confirm.\n\nWait the original board as given is:\n\nFirst row: 🐅🌼🌼🐅\n\nSecond: 🐅🐳🐅🐅\n\nThird: 🌼🐅🌼🐅\n\nFourth: 🐅🌲🌼🌲.\n\nWait, so in column3, the emojis are:\n\nRow1: 🌼.\n\nRow2: 🐅.\n\nRow3: 🌼.\n\nRow4: 🌼.\n\nSo looking for consecutive duplicates:\n\nRow1: 🌼, Row2: 🐅 --> different.\n\nRow2: 🐅, Row3: 🌼 --> different.\n\nRow3: 🌼, Row4: 🌼 → same. So in column3, rows3 and 4 make a run of 2 → one line.\n\nSo column3 contributes 1 line.\n\nWhat's column4?\n\nRow1: 🐅.\n\nRow2: 🐅.\n\nRow3: 🐅.\n\nRow4: 🌲.\n\nWait, checking column4:\n\nRow1: 🐅.\n\nRow2: 🐅.\n\nRow3: 🐅.\n\nRow4: 🌲.\n\nIn column4:\n\nRow1 and row2 are 🐅🐅 → run of 2.\n\nThen row3 is also 🐅 after row2. So that's a run of three, which is still one line because it's continuous.\n\nWe're looking for runs of 2 or more, regardless of the length, but count each run as a single line.\n\nWait, no. Each consecutive run is one line per run. So, for example, in column4, we have:\n\nRow1 and row2: 🐅🐅.\n\nThen row2 and row3: 🐅🐅. So, or wait, it's a single run. That is, all three rows 1,2,3 are connected in a consecutive run.\n\nWait, because in column4, row1 is 🐅, row2 🐅, row3 🐅. So that's a run of three. So this counts as a single line.\n\nThen row4: 🌲, which is different.\n\nSo in column4, the run is rows1-2-3, which is a single line of length 3.\n\nSo column4 contributes 1 line.\n\nWait, another point: when we have multiple runs in the same column.\n\nBut looking at the board:\n\nJust to make sure.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow1: 🐅\n\nRow2: 🐅\n\nRow3: 🐅\n\nRow4: 🌲\n\nSo, row1 to row3 are all 🐅, so a run of 3. So that's a single line, yes.\n\nSo column4: 1.\n\nNow, let's see all columns:\n\nColumn1: 1 line.\n\nColumn2: 0.\n\nColumn3: 1.\n\nColumn4: 1.\n\nSo vertical lines: 1+0+1+1=3.\n\nAdding that to the horizontal lines (2), the total is 2+3=5.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me recount everything.\n\nHorizontal lines: row1 and row2 each have 1, others 0: 2.\n\nVertical lines:\n\nColumn1: 1.\n\nColumn3:1.\n\nColumn4:1.\n\nOther columns: 0.\n\nSo vertical lines: 3.\n\nTotal lines: 2 + 3 =5.\n\nWait, but I think I may have missed something. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at vertical columns:\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow1: 🐅\n\nRow2: 🐅 → same as row1 → run starts. Run is 2.\n\nRow3: 🌼 → different, run stops.\n\nRow4: 🐅 → new run? Let me see: after row2 (🐅), row3 is 🌼, row4 is 🐅 → no consecutive runs. Only rows 1-2.\n\nSo column1 has one vertical line.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow1: 🌼.\n\nRow2: 🐅.\n\nRow3: 🌼.\n\nRow4: 🌼 → same as row3.\n\nSo rows 3 and 4 → run of 2, one line.\n\nYes.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRows 1-2-3 are 🐅, then row4 is 🌲 → so yes, run of 3, counts as one line.\n\nSo vertical lines sum to 3.\n\nWait, but another thought: does a line have to be exactly 2, or longer? Wait, the problem statement says length >=2. So a line longer than 2 counts as one line.\n\nSo looking back, in horizontal lines, rows 1 has a two-length line.\n\nAnother possibility: if in a row, there are three same emojis in a row, does that count as one line, or if any substrings?\n\nBut no, each contiguous run of same emojis in a row counts as a single line. So for example, if a row is AAAB, then A's run is from position1-3, which is a single line of length 3. So just one count.\n\nAdditionally, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\"—so a single run, regardless of its length >=2, counts as one.\n\nSo that's correct earlier counts.\n\nBut wait, another thought: could a vertical line also include a horizontal line? Or are they separate?\n\nNo, they are separate. We count each as independent.\n\nBut perhaps I've made a mistake in counting vertical lines.\n\nLet me go back.\n\nMaybe examining the count again.\n\nHorizontal lines:\n\nRow1: 🐅🌼🌼🐅 → one line (length 2).\n\nRow2: ... → one line.\n\nTotal 2.\n\nVertical lines:\n\nColumn1: 🐅, 🐅, 🌼, 🐅: rows 1-2 → two-line → count 1.\n\nColumn3: 🌼, 🐅, 🌼, 🌼 → rows 3-4 → two-line → count 1.\n\nColumn4: 🐅, 🐅, 🐅, 🌲 → three-line → count 1.\n\nPlus, is there another vertical line elsewhere?\n\nColumn2: 🌼, 🐳, 🐅, 🌲 → all different, so no runs. So 0.\n\nWait, wait! What about column4? It's rows 1-3: 🐅, so that's a run from row1 to row3.\n\nYes, same as earlier.\n\nSo vertical lines count 1 (col1) +1 (col3) +1 (col4) =3.\n\nSo 2 horizontal +3 vertical: total 5.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed other vertical runs.\n\nWait, column3: row3 and row4 are 🌼🌼.\n\nWhat about any other possible runs, perhaps in column 3 above row4?\n\nNo, column3 row4: 🌼, row4+1 is beyond the grid.\n\nAnother possible error: in row2, column2: after 🐳, but no runs.\n\nWait, is there any other run in vertical lines?\n\nLooking through each column.\n\nWait, could I have miscounted column3 as contributing 1 line? Or perhaps another column?\n\nWait, perhaps column1 also has a longer run.\n\nNo, column1 has row1 and 2 as 🐅, not beyond (row3 is 🌼, and row4 is 🐅, which comes singly after.)\n\nSo, under this analysis, the total would be 5.\n\nBut what's the actual answer? Let me make a table perhaps.\n\nLet me represent the board as a grid with rows and columns for easy examination:\n\nRow 1: 🐅 (R1C1), 🌼 (R1C2), 🌼 (R1C3), 🐅 (R1C4)\n\nRow2: 🐅 (R2C1), 🐳 (R2C2), 🐅 (R2C3), 🐅 (R2C4)\n\nRow3: 🌼 (R3C1), 🐅 (R3C2), 🌼 (R3C3), 🐅 (R3C4)\n\nRow4: 🐅 (R4C1), 🌲 (R4C2), 🌼 (R4C3), 🌲 (R4C4)\n\nWait a second, I think I had a mistake with row4 in column3 earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nNo, according to the given board, row4 is: 🐅 🌲 🌼 🌲.\n\nSo in column3, row4 is 🌼. So yes:\n\nColumn3 entries:\n\nR1C3: 🌼\n\nR2C3: 🐅\n\nR3C3: 🌼\n\nR4C3: 🌼.\n\nSo rows3 and 4: 🌼 and 🌼. Yes, that's a run of 2 → counts as 1.\n\nSo the vertical counts are correct.\n\nAnother review: maybe column4 has another run?\n\nNo, column4: all rows 1,2,3 are 🐅, so that's one line.\n\nWait, now, the problem counts both horizontal and vertical lines; but diagonal runs don't matter.\n\nSo, total of H=2, V=3 → sum 5.\n\nSo the answer should be 5.\n\nBut wait another thought: perhaps I'm miscounting vertical runs because a run can be more than two, so in column4, it's a vertical run of 3, which is one line.\n\nThus, vertical lines count as 1 per run, regardless of run length.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, is my count of vertical lines correct? Because I sum columns 1,3,4 as each contributing one.\n\nSo 3.\n\nSo total is 5.\n\nAfter this thorough analysis, I think the answer is 5.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more on a given 4x4 emoji board. Each contiguous run of 2 or more identical emojis in a row or column counts as one line.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Horizontal Lines**:\n   - **Row 1**: 🐅🌼🌼🐅 → The middle two 🌼s form one horizontal line.\n   - **Row 2**: 🐅🐳🐅🐅 → The last two 🐅s form one horizontal line.\n   - **Row 3**: 🌼🐅🌼🐅 → No consecutive duplicates, so no lines.\n   - **Row 4**: 🐅🌲🌼🌲 → No consecutive duplicates, so no lines.\n   - Total horizontal lines: **2**.\n\n2. **Vertical Lines**:\n   - **Column 1**: 🐅, 🐅, 🌼, 🐅 → The first two 🐅s form one vertical line.\n   - **Column 2**: 🌼, 🐳, 🐅, 🌲 → No consecutive duplicates, so no lines.\n   - **Column 3**: 🌼, 🐅, 🌼, 🌼 → The last two 🌼s form one vertical line.\n   - **Column 4**: 🐅, 🐅, 🐅, 🌲 → The first three 🐅s form one vertical line.\n   - Total vertical lines: **3**.\n\n3. **Total Lines**: Adding the horizontal and vertical lines gives **2 + 3 = 5**.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 5"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

{"board":[["🐿","🐿","🐼","🐼"],["🐼","🚀","🐼","🐼"],["🐿","🚀","🚀","🐼"],["✨","✨","🚀","🐿"]],"response":["<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines on a rectangular board made up of emojis. Each line must consist of the same emoji and have a length of at least 2.\n\nFirst, I'll need to look at the board provided. The board is presented as four lines, each with four emojis. Let me write them down to visualize better.\n\nRow 1: 🐿, 🐿, 🐼, 🐼\nRow 2: 🐼, 🚀, 🐼, 🐼\nRow 3: 🐿, 🚀, 🚀, 🐼\nRow 4: ✨, ✨, 🚀, 🐿\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the user wrote the board as:\n\n🐿🐿🐼🐼\n🐼🚀🐼🐼\n🐿🚀🚀🐼\n✨✨🚀🐿\n\nSo it's four rows, each with four emojis.\n\nNow, for each row (horizontal lines) and each column (vertical lines), I need to check for consecutive same emojis with a length of 2 or more.\n\nLet me start by processing each row for horizontal lines.\n\nRow 1: 🐿, 🐿, 🐼, 🐼\nLooking for sequences where two or more same emojis are adjacent. So here, the first two are 🐿, which is a line of length 2. Then the next two are 🐼, another line of 2. So in this row, there are two lines.\n\nRow 2: 🐼, 🚀, 🐼, 🐼\nLooking at each position:\n- Position 1: 🐼 → next is 🚀 (different), so no line.\n- Positions 3 and 4: 🐼, 🐼 → that's a line of 2. So one line in this row.\n\nRow 3: 🐿, 🚀, 🚀, 🐼\nPositions 2 and 3: 🚀, 🚀 → a line of 2. So one line here.\n\nRow 4: ✨, ✨, 🚀, 🐿\nPositions 1 and 2: ✨, ✨ → line of 2. So one line.\n\nSo, summing the horizontal lines: Row1 (2) + Row2 (1) + Row3 (1) + Row4 (1) = 5.\n\nNow, I'll check each column for vertical lines. There are four columns, each with four rows.\n\nColumn 1:\nRow1: 🐿\nRow2: 🐼\nRow3: 🐿\nRow4: ✨\nThese are all different. So no vertical lines in column 1.\n\nColumn 2:\nRow1: 🐿\nRow2: 🚀\nRow3: 🚀\nRow4: ✨\nLooking for sequences here. Let's go step by step.\nRow1: 🐿, then Row2: 🚀 (no); Row2: 🚀, Row3: 🚀. So that's a sequence of 2. But wait, row2 is 🚀, row3 is 🚀, so that's a vertical line. So that's a line of length 2. So one line here.\n\nWait, no. Wait. Wait, in a column, checking vertically. So in column 2, each row's emoji is independent. Let me list them:\n\nPosition (1,2) 🐿, (2,2) 🚀, (3,2) 🚀, (4,2) ✨.\n\nLooking down, same emojis vertically adjacent. So between row2 and row3 in column 2: 🚀, 🚀. That's a vertical line of length 2. So one occurrence.\n\nColumn 3:\nRow1: 🐼\nRow2: 🐼\nRow3: 🚀\nRow4: 🚀\n\nLooking for same in a column. Let's see:\n\nRow1 🐼, row2 🐼: same. So row1 and row2 → length 2. Then, row3 and row4 are 🚀, but they are the same, so another line.\n\nWait, wait. Column3 has:\n\nRow1: 🐼\nRow2: 🐼 → same as row1? Yes, same, so a line of 2.\n\nThen Row3: 🚀\nRow4: 🚀 → same as row3, so another line.\n\nSo column3 has two vertical lines.\n\nWait no. Wait, because each line is any consecutive vertical or horizontal same emojis, but for the count: we have two separate lines in column 3.\n\nBecause lines are made up of exactly two identical consecutive emojis. Wait, no. The question specifies lines formed by same emoji, with length at least 2. So a line can be any segment of two or more same in a straight line.\n\nSo for column3:\n\nRows 1 and 2: 🐼, 🐼 → one line of 2.\n\nThen rows 3 and 4: 🚀, 🚀 → another line of 2.\n\nSo that's two vertical lines in column3.\n\nSo column3 contributes two lines.\n\nNow column4:\n\nRow1: 🐼\nRow2: 🐼\nRow3: 🐼\nRow4: 🐿\n\nLooking down:\n\nRows 1,2,3: 🐼. So this is a vertical line of length 3. That's just one line. Because even though it's longer than 2, it counts as a single line.\n\nAdditionally, there's no more lines in column4.\n\nSo in column4, we have one line.\n\nSo summing the vertical lines: column1 (0) + column2 (1) + column3 (2) + column4 (1) → total 4.\n\nWait, let me recheck:\n\nColumn3: row1 (🐼) and row2 (🐼) → line 1. Then row3 (🚀) and row4 (🚀) → line 2. So that's two for column3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo vertical lines sum to 4.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\ncolumns:\n\n1: 0\n\n2:1\n\n3:2\n\n4:1\n\nTotal 4.\n\nSo, vertical lines contribute 4.\n\nHorizontal:5.\n\nNow total lines: 5 (horizontal) +4 (vertical) = 9?\n\nWait, wait wait:\n\nWait horizontal lines total to 5 and vertical lines 4, so 9 in total.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each column again.\n\nLet me go through each column carefully.\n\nColumn1:\n\n🐿,🐼,🐿,✨ → all different. No lines.\n\nColumn2:\n\n🐿,🚀,🚀,✨ → look for consecutive.\n\nBetween row2 (🚀) and row3 (🚀) → that's a vertical line of 2. So +1.\n\nNo other in column2.\n\nColumn2: 1.\n\nColumn3:\n\n🐼,🐼,🚀,🚀.\n\nRow1 and row2: same → line 1.\n\nRow3 and row4: same → line 2.\n\nColumn3: 2 lines.\n\nColumn4:\n\n🐼, 🐼, 🐼, 🐿.\n\nThese are in a line down.\n\nSo it's a single line of length 3. Thus, counts as 1.\n\nSo column4:1.\n\nSo vertical total is 0+1+2+1 =4.\n\nHorrizontal total:5.\n\nThus, 4+5=9.\n\nSo, the answer should be 9.\n\nWait, but let me verify the horizontal lines again.\n\nFor row1: positions 1-2: 🐿🐿 → line.\n\nPositions3-4: 🐼🐼 → line. So two lines. That's correct.\n\nRow2: positions3-4: 🐼🐼 → one line.\n\nRow3: positions2-3: 🚀🚀 → one line.\n\nRow4: positions1-2:✨✨ → one line.\n\nTotal of 2+1+1+1=5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo vertical lines:4.\n\nTotal is 9.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji on a 4x4 board, where each line has a length of at least 2.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Horizontal Lines\nWe examine each row for consecutive emojis that form lines of length 2 or more:\n\n- **Row 1**: 🐿, 🐿, 🐼, 🐼  \n  - Positions 1-2: 🐿, 🐿 → Line of length 2.  \n  - Positions 3-4: 🐼, 🐼 → Line of length 2.  \n  - Total lines in Row 1: 2.\n\n- **Row 2**: 🐼, 🚀, 🐼, 🐼  \n  - Positions 3-4: 🐼, 🐼 → Line of length 2.  \n  - Total lines in Row 2: 1.\n\n- **Row 3**: 🐿, 🚀, 🚀, 🐼  \n  - Positions 2-3: 🚀, 🚀 → Line of length 2.  \n  - Total lines in Row 3: 1.\n\n- **Row 4**: ✨, ✨, 🚀, 🐿  \n  - Positions 1-2: ✨, ✨ → Line of length 2.  \n  - Total lines in Row 4: 1.\n\n**Total horizontal lines**: 2 (Row 1) + 1 (Row 2) + 1 (Row 3) + 1 (Row 4) = 5.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Vertical Lines\nWe examine each column for consecutive emojis that form lines of length 2 or more:\n\n- **Column 1**: 🐿, 🐼, 🐿, ✨  \n  - All emojis are different.  \n  - Total lines in Column 1: 0.\n\n- **Column 2**: 🐿, 🚀, 🚀, ✨  \n  - Positions 2-3: 🚀, 🚀 → Line of length 2.  \n  - Total lines in Column 2: 1.\n\n- **Column 3**: 🐼, 🐼, 🚀, 🚀  \n  - Positions 1-2: 🐼, 🐼 → Line of length 2.  \n  - Positions 3-4: 🚀, 🚀 → Line of length 2.  \n  - Total lines in Column 3: 2.\n\n- **Column 4**: 🐼, 🐼, 🐼, 🐿  \n  - Positions 1-3: 🐼, 🐼, 🐼 → Line of length 3.  \n  - Total lines in Column 4: 1.\n\n**Total vertical lines**: 0 (Column 1) + 1 (Column 2) + 2 (Column 3) + 1 (Column 4) = 4.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Combine Results\nThe total number of lines is the sum of horizontal and vertical lines:\n\n- **Horizontal lines**: 5  \n- **Vertical lines**: 4  \n- **Total lines**: 5 + 4 = 9  \n\nAnswer: 9"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

{"board":[["🌓","🌿","🌿","🌓"],["🌓","🐩","🌓","🐩"],["🐩","🐩","🌿","🌓"],["🐩","🌿","🌓","🐰"]],"response":["<think>\nOkay, so I've got this problem where I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji on a board. Each line has to be of length two or more. The board is made up of emojis, and I have to output the total count. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the board structure. The board is given as four lines, each representing a row. Each row has four emojis. So it's a 4x4 grid.\n\nLet me write down the board to visualize it better:\n\nRow 1: 🌓🌿🌿🌓\nRow 2: 🌓🐩🌓🐩\nRow 3: 🐩🐩🌿🌓\nRow 4: 🐩🌿�Ｍ🐰 (Wait, wait, the last one is 🐰, not M. I must have read it wrong.)\n\nWait, let me correct that. The fourth row is 🐩🌿🌓🐰. No, wait, the question says each line in the board is:\n\nboard:\n🌓🌿🌿🌓\n🌓🐩🌓🐩\n🐩🐩🌿🌓\n🐩🌿🌓🐰\n\nSo row 1 is 🌓, 🌿, 🌿, 🌓.\nRow 2: 🌓, 🐩, 🌓, 🐩.\nRow 3: 🐩, 🐩, 🌿, 🌓.\nRow 4: 🐩, 🌿, 🌓, 🐰.\n\nI need to check both horizontal and vertical for consecutive same emojis of length ≥2.\n\nI'll approach this by checking each row for horizontal lines, then each column for vertical lines.\n\nStarting with the horizontal lines:\n\nCheck each row for sequences of same emojis, length 2 or more.\n\nRow 1: 🌓 🌿 🌿 🌓\nSo the first two are different. Then the next two together? 🌿 and 🌿: that's a line of two. So count 1.\n\nRow 2: 🌓 🐩 🌓 🐩. Each adjacent pair alternates, no two in a row.\n\nRow 3: 🐩 🐩 🌿 🌓. The first two 🐩s make a line of 2. So count 1.\n\nRow 4: 🐩 🌿 🌓 🐰. No two same in a row.\n\nSo horizontal lines: 2 so far.\n\nNow vertical lines. For each column, check the adjacent emojis below.\n\nColumn 1: 🌓, 🌓, 🐩, 🐩.\nLooking for consecutive duplicates. Let's go step by step.\n\nRow1: 🌓\nRow2: 🌓 → same as row1, so count 1 (since length 2).\nRow3: 🐩 → different from row2, no.\nRow4: 🐩 → same as row3, so this is another line of 2. So for column 1, two lines: one from rows 1-2 (2-long), and another from rows 3-4. So that's two separate lines, each of length 2. So count +=2.\n\nWait, wait. Actually, the vertical count needs to consider consecutive same emojis. Let me think again for each column so as to not miss any.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to run through each column and find for consecutive duplicates:\n\nColumn 1:\nRow1: 🌓\nRow2: 🌓 → same as row1 → count for line of 2.\nRow3: 🐩 → different.\nRow4: 🐩 → same as row3 → another line of 2.\nSo column 1 contributes 2 vertical lines.\n\nColumn 2:\nRow1: 🌿\nRow2: 🐩 → different.\nRow3: 🐩 → same as row2? No, row2 is 🐩, row3 is position in column 2. Wait, column 2 in row2 is 🐩? Let me re-express each column properly.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the columns. Let me represent each column.\n\nOriginal row data:\n\nRow1: [0][0]=🌓, [0][1]=🌿, [0][2]=🌿, [0][3]=🌓.\n\nRow2: [1][0]=🌓, [1][1]=🐩, [1][2]=🌓, [1][3]=🐩.\n\nRow3: [2][0]=🐩, [2][1]=🐩, [2][2]=🌿, [2][3]=🌓.\n\nRow4: [3][0]=🐩, [3][1]=🌿, [3][2]=🌓, [3][3]=🐰.\n\nNow, columns have indexes 0 to 3.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow0: 🌓\n\nRow1: 🌓 → same as row0 → line here.\n\nRow2: 🐩 → different.\n\nRow3: 🐩 → same as row2 → but wait, row2 is column0's row2 is 🐩. Wait, no.\n\nWait, column 0:\n\nRow indexes 0 to 3:\nRow0: 🌓\nRow1: 🌓\nRow2: 🐩\nRow3: 🐩\n\nSo from 0,1: same, then 2,3: same. So there are two vertical lines here, each length 2.\n\nSo column 0 contributes 2 lines.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow0: 🌿,\n\nRow1: 🐩,\n\nRow2: 🐩,\n\nRow3: 🌿.\n\nSo check for consecutive:\n\n- Row0 and row1: different.\n- Row1 and row2: 🐩 and 🐩 → same, length 2.\n- Row2 and row3: different.\n\nSo column1 has 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: 🌿,\n\nRow1: 🌓,\n\nRow2: 🌿,\n\nRow3: 🌓.\n\nLooking for consecutive same:\n\nRow0 and 1: different.\n\nRow1 and 2: 🌓 and 🌿? Wait no, column2's row1 is 🌓.\n\nWait, row1, column2 is 🌓. Wait, row0's column2 is 🌿.\n\nRow1 column2 is 🌓.\n\nRow2 column2 is 🌿.\n\nRow3 column2 is 🌓.\n\nSo each column2, consecutive elements:\n\n0(row): 🌿,\n1: 🌓 (diff from 0),\n2: 🌿 (diff from1),\n3: 🌓 (diff from2). So no vertical lines here.\n\nNo lines in column2.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🌓,\n\nRow1: 🐩,\n\nRow2: 🌓,\n\nRow3: 🐰.\n\nLooking for consecutive same.\n\nRow0: 🌓, row1: 🐩 → diff.\n\nRow1: 🐩, row2: 🌓 → diff.\n\nRow2: 🌓, row3: 🐰 → diff.\n\nSo no vertical lines in column3.\n\nSo let's sum up the vertical lines:\n\nColumn0: 2 lines.\n\nColumn1: 1 line.\n\nOthers: 0.\n\nTotal vertical lines: 3.\n\nNow, adding the horizontal lines (2) + vertical lines (3) => 5.\n\nWait, but I think I missed something. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no. Let me recount:\n\nHorizontally:\n\nRow1: 🌿 🌿 → +1.\n\nRow3: 🐩🐩 → +1. So 2.\n\nColumn0: rows 0-1 (🌓🌓) → 1 line.\n\nThen rows 2-3 (🐩🐩) → another. So 2 lines for column0.\n\nColumn1: only rows1-2 (🐩🐩) → 1 line.\n\nSo column0 has 2 lines, column1 has 1. So vertical lines 3.\n\nOverall total lines is 2 (horizontal) +3 (vertical)=5.\n\nWait, but let's make sure I'm not missing any other vertical lines. Are there any longer lines? Because, for example, if there are three same in a column, like in column0, [🌓, 🐩, 🐩, 🐩], but no, column0 doesn't have three. Column0 is 🌓, �gado, 🐩, 🐩. So rows 2 and 3 are same. So 2 in a row there.\n\nWait, what about lines longer than 2? For this problem, whether they're longer than 2, but each possible line of exactly 2 or more counts as one line. But wait, if in a column I have three same emojis, then that's one line of 3, which is counted as one. Or are we supposed to count each possible consecutive pair? No, the line is defined as a maximal consecutive sequence of same emojis, length ≥2. So for example, in a column with four same emojis, that's one line of length 4.\n\nWait, in the problem statement: 'lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.' So each such line, regardless of how long, counts as one. Wait, example: if a row has three same in a row, that's one line. So in that case, the count is per line, not per possible pairs.\n\nHmm, so each row or column can have multiple lines only if there are separate maximum consecutive sequences.\n\nWait, so for example:\n\nRow like: A A A → is one single line of length 3.\n\nAnother example: A A B B A → it has two lines (the first two and the next two, supposing that's the same. Wait, no, because in that example, the A's are two, then B's two. So two lines in the same row.\n\nWait, wait, but in that example, the row is AAA… Well, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's look at the problem statement again. It says, \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So, each block of 2 or more same consecutive emojis counts as a line. So for each full line, regardless of its length, whether 2,3,4..., count it once.\n\nSo for example, if a row has AAAA, that's one line of 4, not two lines of 2 overlapping.\n\nAh, I see. So when I was analyzing earlier, in column0, row0:🌓, row1:🌓, row2:🐩, row3:🐩.\n\nSo in column0, the first two rows form a line of length 2, and the next two form another line of length 2. So in total, two separate lines. So that counts as 2.\n\nSimilarly, in row3, which has 🐩🐩🌿🌓, the first two are same → count 1, no other.\n\nSo, for vertical checking, in column1, row1 is 🐩 and row2 is 🐩 → that's one line. So column1 contributes 1.\n\nWait, no: column1 has row1🐩, row2🐩, row3 is 🌿, so it's a line of two, only. So that's one line.\n\nSo, according to this, the vertical lines count is 3 (two from column0 and 1 from column1), and horizontal is 2, totaling 5.\n\nWait, but wait another possibility: could the board have diagonal lines? No, the problem says horizontal or vertical only. So diagonals are not considered.\n\nWait, what about row2 in the vertical column processing?\n\nLooking back, in column0, the first two and then another two.\n\nBut then the question arises whether I considered all columns for vertical. Let's see.\n\nSo columns are each index 0,1,2,3.\n\nNo, I think there are no other vertical lines. Let me check column3 again.\n\nIn column3:\n\nRow0: 🌓\n\nRow1: 🐩\n\nRow2: 🌓\n\nRow3: 🐰\n\nAll are different except rows 0 and 2? Ah wait, 0 and 2 are 🌓 and �_mC? No, row0's column3 is 🌓, row2's column3 is 🌓 as well. Wait, are their consecutive? No, because row2 is two rows after row0. So only row0 and row1 are same in column0.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let's re-examine:\n\nEach column is from top to bottom. So for example:\n\nColumn0 (top to bottom): 🌓, 🌓, 🐩, 🐩.\n\nLooking for consecutive same:\n\nBetween row0 and row1: same → line of 2.\n\nBetween row1 and row2: different.\n\nBetween row2 and row3: same → another line.\n\nSo that's two lines in column0.\n\nSimilarly, column1: 🌿, 🐩, 🐩, 🌿.\n\nConsecutive same only between row1 and row2 → one line.\n\nSo vertical lines: 2 +1=3.\n\nSo total lines: 2 horizontal, 3 vertical; 5 total lines.\n\nBut wait, let me not be hasty. Let me go through each line again to make sure.\n\nAlternative approach: create a grid and mark all lines.\n\nLet's represent the grid as a 2D array.\n\nGrid:\nRow0: 🌓 🌿 🌿 🌓\nRow1: 🌓 🐩 🌓 🐩\nRow2: 🐩 🐩 🌿 🌓\nRow3: 🐩 🌿 🌓 🐰\n\nNow, proceed to check each row and column.\n\nHorizontal:\n\nRow0: check for same consecutive. Positions (0,0) and (0,1) are different. Then position (0,1) is 🌿, same as (0,2), so that's a line. (0,3) is different. So row0 contributes 1 line starting at (0,1) length 2.\n\nRow1: 🌓 🐩 🌓 🐩. Each pair is different except between (1,3) is same as next... Wait, each next pair? Let's see:\n\n(1,0) and (1,1): different.\n\n(1,1) and (1,2): different.\n\n(1,2) and (1,3): different. So no horizontal lines in row1.\n\nRow2: 🐩 🐩 🌿 🌓. (2,0)=🐩, (2,1)=🐩 → line of 2. (2,3) different. So row2 contributes 1 line.\n\nRow3: 🐩 🌿 🌓 🐰 → no consecutive same. So no lines.\n\nSo total horizontal lines: 2.\n\nNow vertical:\n\nCheck each column, from top to bottom.\n\nColumn0:\nRow0: 🌓, compared to row1: same → line from (0,0)-(1,0). (Number of same in a row: 2). Next, row2 is 🐩, which is same as row3's column0 which is 🐩. So between row2 and row3: same → line of 2.\n\nColumn0 has 2 lines.\n\nColumn1:\nRow0: 🌿, not same as row1 🐩.\n\nRow1: 🐩 same as row2 🐩 → line from (1,1) to (2,1).\n\nRow2: 🐩 vs row3's 🌿: no.\n\nColumn1 contributes 1 line.\n\nColumn2:\nRow0: 🌿 → row1: 🌓 → different.\n\nRow1: 🌓, row2: 🌿 → different.\n\nRow2: 🌿, row3: 🌓 → different.\n\nNo vertical lines.\n\nColumn3:\nRow0: 🌓. row1: 🐩 → different.\n\nRow1: 🐩, row2: 🌓 → different.\n\nRow2: 🌓, row3: 🐰 → different.\n\nSo columns 2 and 3 contribute nothing.\n\nSo vertical lines: column0:2, column1:1 → 3.\n\nThus 2+3=5.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought there was a line in row3's column0, but no, in row3, it's the fourth row.\n\nWait, another check: when looking at vertical lines in column0, rows 0 and 1 are same, and rows 2 and 3 are same. So that's two separate vertical lines in column0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the lines are:\n\nHorizontal:\n\nRow0: positions 1-2 → length 2.\n\nRow2: positions 0-1 → length 2.\n\nVertical:\n\nColumn0: 0-1 → length 2.\n\nColumn0: 2-3 → length 2.\n\nColumn1: 1-2 → length 2.\n\nTotal: 5.\n\nWait a moment, I think I have accounted for all.\n\nWait a thing: column0, rows 0-1, that's a line. Rows 2-3, another line. So two lines in column0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the total is 2 (horizontal) + 3 (vertical) =5.\n\nI think that's solid.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji on a 4x4 grid, where each line has a length of 2 or more.

{"board":[["🦆","🐃","🌔","🐃"],["🐃","🌒","🌔","🐃"],["🐃","🐃","🌔","🐃"],["🌒","🌒","🌔","🌒"]],"response":["<think>\nOkay, so I've got this problem where I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines made by the same emoji on a 4x4 board. The lines should be 2 or longer. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll try to visualize the board. The given board is a 4x4 grid, so there are four rows and four columns. Each row is given as:\n\n1st row: 🦆🐃🌔🐃\n2nd row: 🐃🌒🌔🐃\n3rd row: 🐃🐃🌔🐃\n4th row: 🌒🌒🌔🌒\n\nI can replace these with more readable characters to make it easier to spot patterns. Let's assign each emoji a letter:\n\n🦆 - A\n🐃 - B\n🌔 - C\n🌒 - D\n\nSo the board becomes:\n\nRow 1: A B C B\nRow 2: B D C B\nRow 3: B B C B\nRow 4: D D C D\n\nNow, I need to scan both horizontally and vertically for consecutive same emojis. Lines must be of length ≥2.\n\nLet's start with horizontal lines.\n\nLooking row by row:\n\nRow 1: A, B, C, B → The B's at position 2 and 4. But only single B in row 1 except positions 2 and 3: no, wait, the first row is A, B, C, B. So in row 1, each cell is A, then B, then C, then B. There are no two same consecutive emojis at first glance. Wait, the second and third cells are B and C—so no. Also, the last two are C and B. So no horizontal lines here of length 2. Unless, wait, maybe I'm missing something. No, in row 1, each pair is unique, so no lines.\n\nRow 2: B, D, C, B → Each cell is different from the next, so no horizontal lines of 2 or more.\n\nRow 3: B, B, C, B → Oh, the first two are B's. That's a horizontal line of 2. So we count that as one. Next, the third is C and fourth is B. So nothing here.\n\nRow 4: D, D, C, D → Again, the first two are D's. That's a line of length 2. So another line here.\n\nSo total horizontal lines so far are 2.\n\nWait, maybe I should count longer lines too. For example, three in a row. Let me check row 3. The first two are BB, yes, but the third is C, so it's only two. Row 4: first two D's, so same.\n\nNow, moving on to vertical columns. I need to check each column in all four rows.\n\nColumn 1: A, B, B, D. Let's look for consecutive same. A is only in first position. Next is B, which is in row 2 and 3. Wait: rows 2 and 3 are B, B. So between row 2 and 3 in column 1, we have B in position 2 and then B in position 3. That's a vertical line of length 2. So that's another line.\n\nWait, column 1:\n\nRow1: A\n\nRow2: B\n\nRow3: B\n\nRow4: D\n\nSo between row2 and row3, two B's. So vertical line here.\n\nColumn 2: B, D, B, D. So row 1 is B, row2 D, row3 B, row4 D. So nothing here. Only alternates.\n\nColumn 3: C, C, C, C. Oh wait, wait. Column 3 is C in all four rows. Because looking at each row:\n\nRow1: C\n\nRow2: C\n\nRow3: C\n\nRow4: C\n\nSo in this column, there's a vertical line of length 4. So we count that once as a single vertical line (since it's one continuous line). But does it also have smaller lines within? Well, the problem counts each possible line once, whether it's longer. I think the rule is when any consecutive sequence of length ≥2 is present. So in column 3, the entire column is same, so it's just one line of length 4.\n\nColumn4: B, B, B, D. Let's see:\n\nRow1: B\n\nRow2: B → so row1 and row2 make BB.\n\nRow3: B → so row2, row3 are B and B. So wait, we have row1: B, row2: B, row3: B. So that's three in a column. So that's a vertical line of 3. Then row4 is D, which breaks the chain.\n\nSo how many lines does this count as? It's a single vertical line. Because even though it's longer, it's counted once, as it's a continuous line. So this column contributes one vertical line.\n\nWait, but the line here is length 3: rows 1,2,3 are all B. That's a single vertical line, as they're consecutive.\n\nSo for vertical lines:\n\nColumn1: 1 line (BB)\nColumn3: 1 line (CCCC)\nColumn4: 1 line (BBB row1-3)\nWait, column4's row4 has D, so it's B,B,B in rows 1-3, which is 3 consecutive, counted as one line. So that's three vertical lines.\n\nSo total vertical lines: 3 (from columns 1,3,4).\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nColumn1: row2 and row3: BB → that's one.\n\nColumn3: all four C's → another.\n\nColumn4: rows 1-3 have B's → that's another.\n\nThat's three in total.\n\nSo combining horizontal and vertical:\n\nHorizontal lines: 2 (row3 and row4 each have a pair)\nVertical lines: 3 (columns 1,3,4).\n\nBut wait, I might have missed some. Let me go back.\n\nWait, perhaps row4 is D D C D → first two D's. So that's one. And row3's first two B's: another. So that's two horizontal.\n\nIn vertical, column1 has two consecutive B's.\n\nColumn3 has four C's.\n\nColumn4: first three B's—so one vertical.\n\nThat's all the verticals. So total vertical lines: 3 vertical. Horizontal: 2.\n\nSo total of 2+3=5 lines. Wait, but wait a minute.\n\nWait, column4 has four cells, but the first three are B's and the fourth is D. So only the first three are continuous, which is a vertical line of 3, so that's one line.\n\nWait, but perhaps in column4, the first three B's (row1-3) count as a single line of length 3, and row2-3 is also part of that. But the problem counts the number of such lines. So each contiguous sequence counts once. So for a line of 3, it's one entry in the count. So it's considered as a single line.\n\nWait, no. Let me think—does each contiguous segment count as one, regardless of how long it is. So the question is, for example, a line of 3 is one line, even though it includes two lines of two. No, no. The problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So any such line, regardless of whether it's longer.\n\nSo a vertical column like in column 3, which has four of the same, counts as one line (since it's a single continuous line).\n\nSimilarly, a vertical column with three same would be one line.\n\nSo in column1: B in rows 2 and 3: counts as one.\n\nColumn3: four C's: one line.\n\nColumn4: three B's: one line.\n\nSo vertical total is three lines.\n\nNow, for the horizontal lines: row3 has two B's (first two cells) → one line.\n\nRow4 has two D's first two cells → another line.\n\nSo two lines in horizontal.\n\nSo total is 5.\n\nWait, but wait another look at vertical columns.\n\nWait, column3 is four C's, so that's one line of four.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, is it 4 lines? Because C is in all four rows. So it's four in a vertical line, but for the count, it's just one.\n\nNow, wait. Wait, looking again:\n\nLet me write the columns:\n\nColumn1: A, B, B, D → BB in rows 2 and 3.\n\nColumn2: B, D, B, D → nothing, each emoji alternates.\n\nColumn3: C, C, C, C → four Cs: one line.\n\nColumn4: B, B, B, D → three Bs: one line.\n\nSo vertical lines total: 1 (column1) +1 (column3) +1 (column4) = 3.\n\nHorizontal lines: row3 has 'BB' → 1. row4 has 'DD' → 1. So horizontal 2.\n\nSo total lines: 5.\n\nWait, but wait, what about the second column in row2 and 3: in column3, all four C's—yes, that's one.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check whether any other columns or rows have more lines.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRows:\n\nRow1: A B C B → no.\n\nRow2: B D C B → D and followed by C → nothing. B at end.\n\nRow3: B B C B → first two B's → one line.\n\nRow4: D D C D → first two D's → another line.\n\nSo two in horizontal.\n\nVertical columns:\n\nColumn1: B in row2 and 3 → one line.\n\nColumn2: nothing.\n\nColumn3: all C's → one line.\n\nColumn4: row1,2,3 B's → one line.\n\nSo yes, three in vertical.\n\nSo 3+2=5.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check if any other lines are present.\n\nFor vertical:\n\nIs there more than one line in a column? For example, could there be two separate lines in a single column?\n\nLike, suppose a column has B in first two rows, then D in third, then C in fourth. That would have one line of two.\n\nIn column4, the three B's are rows1-3: is that the only line in column4? Yeah, because from 1-2, then 2-3, and 1-3, but all part of the same continuous line. So counts as one.\n\nSo the total is 5.\n\nBut wait, hold on—looking at rows 3 and 4: in row3, the last cell is B. In row4, it's D. So nothing there.\n\nWait, another angle: did I forget any other rows that have consecutive same emojis?\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow1: A, B, C, B → nothing—B is between A and C.\n\nRow2: B, D, C, B → each cell is unique except for B at start and end, but they're not consecutive.\n\nRow3: B, B, C, B → two Bs, then another B later but separated.\n\nRow4: D, D, C, D → two Ds, then D after C.\n\nSo in row4, first two D's make a line, but last D is after C, so it's not part of a consecutive line of 2 or longer.\n\nSo horizontal, only two lines.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier—isn't row4's first two D's only once? So that's counted as one.\n\nIn vertical:\n\nThree.\n\nSo 3 plus 2 is 5.\n\nHence, the total should be 5.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji on a 4x4 board, where each line has a length of 2 or more.

I'll start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the board. The board is 4 rows by 4 columns, and each cell has an emoji. Let me write them out clearly:\n\nRow 1: 🎄 🦊 🦊 🎄\nRow 2: 🐐 🐧 🦊 🐐\nRow 3: 🎄 🎄 🐧 🦊\nRow 4: 🐐 🐐 🦊 🐧\n\nWait, wait, I'll number them because sometimes indices help. Let me index rows from top to bottom (row 1 to 4) and columns left to right (1 to 4). So each cell can be identified as (row, column).\n\nSo, the grid looks like:\n\nRow 1:\n(1,1)= 🎄, (1,2)= 🦊, (1,3)= 🦊, (1,4)= 🎄\n\nRow 2:\n(2,1)= 🐐, (2,2)= 🐧, (2,3)= 🦊, (2,4)= 🐐\n\nRow 3:\n(3,1)= 🎄, (3,2)= 🎄, (3,3)= 🐧, (3,4)= 🦊\n\nRow 4:\n(4,1)= 🐐, (4,2)= 🐐, (4,3)= 🦊, (4,4)= 🐧\n\nNow, my task is to count all the lines—either horizontal or vertical—that have the same emoji and are of length 2 or more. So I need to check both directions: for each cell, look to the right (horizontal) and down (vertical) to see if consecutive emojis are the same.\n\nI think it's best if I check each possible direction for each cell, without double-counting. So for horizontal lines, I can check each row, see consecutive duplicates, and calculate the number of lines in that row. Similarly for vertical lines, check each column, find consecutive duplicates, and sum those.\n\nAlternatively, since lines can vary in length from 2 upwards, a line can encompass multiple shorter lines. For example, a line of 3 same emojis has 2 lines of length 2: positions (1,2,3) gives lines (1,2) and (2,3), but it also contributes one line of length 3. Wait, but I think the problem is asking for each possible contiguous segment of same emojis. But actually, maybe it's asking for each maximal line. Because, for instance, a line like ABBB has runs of 3 Bs, which would contribute 1 line of length 2 and perhaps another, but maybe I should count all possible contiguous lines longer than 1.\n\nWait, the question says lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more. So any segment that has two or more same emojis in a row. So overlapping segments are possible.\n\nBut perhaps I should approach it by checking for runs of same emojis in each row and column, and for each run of length L >=2, the number of possible lines is (L-1) for that run. For example, a run of 4 has 3 lines (since each consecutive pair forms a line, but since it's 3 overlapping pairs, but I think each line of 2 is a separate count but perhaps not: wait, the problem is about the total count of lines, so each consecutive pair counts. Or wait, no, a line of length 3 constitutes two lines of length 2 and one line of length 3. But wait, I think the problem requires to count all lines of length >=2, regardless of their length beyond 2.\n\nWait, the wording is ambiguous. Let me read the initial instruction again.\n\nThe problem says: count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more. So perhaps each 'maximal' line is counted as one. For example, a run of 4 in a row would be a single line of length 4. But actually, I'm a bit confused because a run of 4 will include lines of 2,3,4. But perhaps the question is to count each maximal straight line. So any contiguous sequence of same emojis, either horizontal or vertical, of length 2 or more.\n\nWait, but the wording is a bit unclear. When it says 'number of lines formed by same emoji, with a length of 2 or more', perhaps it refers to each maximal continuous sequence of the same emoji in a row or column, as long as their length is 2 or more.\n\nIn computer science, when counting runs, a run is a maximum-length sequence of the same character occurring consecutively. So, for example, 'AAAB' has a run of 3 'A's.\n\nSo applying that approach, each horizontal and vertical run is a maximal sequence in a single row or column.\n\nSo the algorithm should be:\n\n1. For each row, scan each cell and see how long the runs of same emojis are. But also, for each run of length L, contribute 1 to the count if L >=2.\n\n2. Do the same for each column, vertically.\n\nWait no, because in a row, when you have a run of length 3, that's one line of length 3, so it contributes 1. But in another approach, the same run can be part of two lines of length 2 as well as a single of length 3.\n\nWhich is correct?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" The question is, what constitutes a line here? Is each individual line of 2,3,4, etc. counted, or is a maximal line counted once regardless of length?\n\nI think it's the latter. Because in the sample input, perhaps when I look at the first row:\n\n🎄 🦊 🦊 🎄\n\nHere, the 🦊 is two in a row. So it counts as one line (since it's length 2). Also, in the third row, 🎄 🎄 is a line. So you count each run regardless of how long it is beyond 2.\n\nSo for a run length L in a row, you add 1 if L >=2, else 0. Similarly, for each vertical run.\n\nWait, let me check the sample situation.\n\nIn first row, I see for example 🎄 in positions 1 and 4, but they are same but not adjacent, so no line there.\n\nIn first row, the 🦊 is at 2 and 3, so that is a line of length 2. So count as 1.\n\nIn row 3, first two are 🎄, which form a line of 2, count as 1.\n\nWhat about a longer run, for example, if a row has three same emojis: say, AAA... then the run is length 3, so contributes 1.\n\nThus, in that case, the approach is to count the number of runs in each row and column, considering whether the run length is >= 2.\n\nWait, but runs in a row or column are sequences. So for each row, I process each cell in order, keep track of the current run, and whenever a run ends, if its length was >=2, I add 1.\n\nSame for columns.\n\nSo, let me plan the approach:\n\n1. Check each row for horizontal runs.\n\n   For each row in the board:\n      Initialize current_emoji = None, current_length = 0.\n      For each emoji in the row from left to right:\n         if same as current_emoji:\n             current_length +=1\n         else:\n             if previous current_length >=2:\n                 increment count\n             current_emoji = this emoji\n             current_length = 1\n      After processing all emojis in row, check if last run’s current_length >=2 and add to count.\n\n2. Do the same for each column for vertical runs.\n\nWait, but for columns, we process top to bottom.\n\nSo, after doing this, the total count is sum of horizontal and vertical runs.\n\nNow, let's parse the given grid according to this approach.\n\nProcessing each row for horizontal runs.\n\nRow 1: 🎄 🦊 🦊 🎄\n\nProcessing each emoji:\n\nStart: current_emoji = None, length=0.\n- First emoji: 🎄. Since none, set current_emoji to 🎄, length=1.\n- Second 🦊: different, so check if run was >=2. Current_emoji was 🎄, length 1. So no. Now, current_emoji is 🦊, length=1.\n- Third 🦊: same as current. length becomes 2. \nNow, since we're at the third position, not the end yet.\n- Fourth 🎄: different. So check the previous run (🦊, length 2). Since 2 >=2, add 1 to count. Then reset current_emoji to 🎄, length=1.\n\nAfter processing the row, check last run: 🎄, length 1. Not added.\n\nSo row 1 contributes 1.\n\nRow 2: 🐐 🐧 🦊 🐐\n\nProcess each emoji:\n\ncurrent_emoji = None.\n\nFirst: 🐐 (set, length=1)\nSecond: 🐧, different. Previous run was 1; no count. Now current_emoji = 🐧, length=1.\nThird: 🦊, different. Previous run (🐧) was 1. No count. Current_emoji = 🦊, length=1.\nFourth: 🐐, different. Previous run (🦊) was 1. No count. Now current_emoji 🐐, length=1.\n\nSo after row 2, all runs are length 1, no contributions. So 0.\n\nRow3: 🎄 🎄 🐧 🦊\n\nProcess:\n\nFirst: 🎄, length=1.\nSecond: 🎄, same. length=2 → however, will not count until the run ends.\n\nThird: 🐧, different. Now, check previous run. run was 🎄, length 2 → count +=1. Then, set to 🐧, length=1.\n\nFourth: 🦊, different. Previous run was 1 → no count. Now current_emoji: 🦊, length=1.\n\nAt the end of the row, check last run (🦊, length=1 → no addition.\n\nThus, row3 contributes 1.\n\nRow4: 🐐 🐐 🦊 🐧 \n\nProcess:\n\nFirst: 🐐, length=1.\n\nSecond: 🐐, same → length=2.\n\nThird: 🦊, different. Previous run (🐐, length=2) → count +=1. Then current emoji is 🦊, length=1.\n\nFourth: 🐧, different. Previous run (🦊, length=1 → no. So at the end, check run: 🐧, length=1.\n\nThus, row4 adds 1.\n\nNow summing all row contributions: 1 (row1) + 0 (row2) + 1 (row3) + 1 (row4) → total rows contribute 3.\n\nNow, let's process each column for vertical runs. There are four columns.\n\nCol1: 🎄, 🐐, 🎄, 🐐.\n\nWhich is emojis: [ 🎄, 🐐, 🎄, 🐐 ]\n\nLooking for runs of >=2 same vertically.\n\nProcess:\n\ncurrent_emoji = 🎄, length=1.\n\nNext (row2): 🐐 → different. Run length was 1 → no count. current_emoji now 🐐, length=1.\n\nNext (row3): 🎄 → different. Run was 1 → no. current_emoji now 🎄, length=1.\n\nNext (row4): 🐐 → different. Run was 1 → no count.\n\nAfter processing, the last run is 1 → nothing. So column1 contributes 0.\n\nCol2: 🦊, 🐧, 🎄, 🐐.\n\nEmojis: [🦊, 🐧, 🎄, 🐐 ]\n\nNo possible runs. All are single, so contribute 0.\n\nCol3: 🦊, 🦊, 🐧, 🦊.\n\nEmojis: [ 🦊, 🦊, 🐧, 🦊 ]\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent_emoji = 🦊, length=1.\n\nNext (row2): 🦊 → same → length=2.\n\nIf we think of the run ending when the next is different, but in this case, the next is:\n\nrow3: 🐧 → different. So check run of 2 🦊 → count +=1. Now current_emoji is 🐧, length=1.\n\nRow4: 🦊 → different. Previous run is 1 → no count. So current_emoji is 🦊, length=1.\n\nAt end of column, run is 1 → no.\n\nThus, column3 adds 1.\n\nCol4: 🎄, 🐐, 🦊, 🐧.\n\nEmojis: [ 🎄, 🐐, 🦊, 🐧 ]\n\nAll different, no runs. So 0.\n\nSo for columns, column3 is the only one with a vertical run of length 2. Thus, vertical contrib is 1.\n\nAdding horizontal (3) and vertical (1) runs, total is 4.\n\nWait but wait—did I make a mistake? Let me recheck.\n\nIn the rows, I got 1 (row1) + 0 + 1 (row3) + 1 (row4) → 3.\n\nIn the columns: 0 (col1) + 0 (col2) + 1 (col3) + 0 (col4) → 1.\n\nThus, 3+1=4.\n\nWait, but let me think about column3 again. The emojis are:\n\nrow1: 🦊\n\nrow2: 🦊\n\nrow3: 🐧\n\nrow4: 🦊.\n\nWait, I thought that in column3, the run is 🦊 in rows1-2 (length 2), then row3 is different, then row4 is 🦊.\n\nWait no, in column3, the emojis in each row are:\n\nRow1: 🦊 (column index 3 is correct? Wait ingetting the board correctly. Let me re-examine.\n\nActually, the columns are:\n\nEach column index:\n\ncolumn1: [🎄 (1,1), 🐐 (2,1), 🎄 (3,1), 🐐 (4,1)]\n\ncolumn2: [🦊 (1,2), 🐧 (2,2), 🎄 (3,2), 🐐 (4,2)]\n\ncolumn3: [🦊 (1,3), 🦊 (2,3), 🐧 (3,3), 🦊 (4,3)]\n\nSo, column3 emojis are:\n\nrow1: 🦊\n\nrow2: 🦊\n\nrow3: 🐧\n\nrow4: 🦊.\n\nHmm, but when processing vertically in column3, the pattern is:\n\nrow1 🦊, row2 🦊 (same), so run after two rows is two, then row3: different (🐧) → run ends here. So that was a run of 2, so counted once. Then, after that, row4 is 🦊 but that's single. So yes, column3 contributes 1.\n\nSo vertical total is 1 from column3.\n\nWait, but in column3 there's another occurrence of 🦊 at row4, but it's after a different emoji, so no run.\n\nNow re-checking the rows:\n\nRow1’s run is 2 → count 1.\n\nRow3’s run of 2 in 🎄.\n\nRow4: run of 2 in 🐐.\n\nSo sum rows: 3.\n\nSum columns: 1 → total 4.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Oh, wait. What about the lines that are in the same direction but perhaps longer than 2? But in this case, the rows I looked at have maximum 2 in runs except for the column3 run which is 2, and no longer runs.\n\nHmm, so the total would be 4 lines.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I missed some runs in the rows. Let me check row3 again.\n\nRow3: 🎄🎄🐧🦊.\n\nRun in first two positions: length 2 → count as 1. Other positions are single.\n\nSo row3 contributes 1.\n\nRow4: 🐐🐐. Run of 2 → count. So yes.\n\nSo my initial calculation of 3 in horizontal seems correct.\n\nWhat about columns? Another column might have. Wait in column4:\n\nrow4 ends with 🐧, but no. So yeah, column3 is the only with vertical run.\n\nWait maybe I made a mistake elsewhere. Let's look for each row and column in detail.\n\nRow by row:\n\nRow1: 🎄 🦊 🦊 🎄\n\nAs before: the 🦊 in positions 2-3: one run of 2 → 1.\n\nRow2: 🐐 🐧 🦊 🐐 → all runs of 1, so 0.\n\nRow3: 🎄 🎄 🐧 🦊 → run of 2: 1.\n\nRow4: 🐐 🐐 🦊 🐧 → run of 2: 1.\n\nHorizontal: 3.\n\nColumn by column:\n\nColumn1:\n\nRows 1-2: 🎄, 🐐 → different.\n\nRows2-3: 🐐, 🎄 → different.\n\nRows3-4: 🎄, 🐐 → different.\n\nNo runs of 2 → 0.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRows1-4: 🦊, 🐧, 🎄, 🐐.\n\nAll different, 0.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRows1: 🦊\n\nRows2: 🦊 → end of run. length 2 → count 1.\n\nRows3-4: 🐧, 🦊 → different.\n\nSo 1 vertical here.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRows1-2: 🎄, 🐐 → different.\n\nOthers: row3 is 🦊, row4 🐧. No runs.\n\nSo columns: total 1.\n\n3+1=4.\n\nSo the answer should be 4.\n\nWait, but another thought: maybe in the processing of vertical lines, there are more? For example, what about column1 in row1 and row3. 🎄 in (1,1) and (3,1). But these are not adjacent—so no run. Similarly for others.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe I missed horizontal lines in row1.\n\nWait, in row1, the first and last emojis are 🎄 but they are not adjacent. So no.\n\nThus, I think the total is 4.\n\nSo the answer is 4.\n\nWait no, wait! Let me re-examine.\n\nWait row2: 🐐 🐧 🦊 🐐.\n\nIn row2, the first and last emojis are 🐐. Are they in the same row? Yes, but not adjacent. So no line there. Thus, row2 contributes 0.\n\nWhat about row3?\n\nAnother possibility is in row3, positions 2 and 3:\n\n🎄, 🎄, 🐧 → in row3: 2 🎄, which counts as 1.\n\nBut is there a 3-length or 2-length elsewhere?\n\nYes? So row3's count is correct.\n\nSo, does this make the total 4.\n\nAnother point: how about the vertical lines.\n\nIn column3, rows1-2: two 🦊, run → count 1.\n\nIs there another run in column3?\n\nNo. Row4's 🦊 is beyond a different symbol, so no.\n\nThus, the count is 4.\n\nSo the answer should be 4.\n\nWait wait but the sample's answer is in the question. Wait no, the user didn't provide a sample question but their own.\n\nNo, in their problem statement, the board is given, so I have to process that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I missed some vertical or horizontal runs.\n\nWait, perhaps column3, but another run. Let me think again.\n\nIn column3:\n\nrow1: 🦊\n\nrow2: 🦊 → run of 2.\n\nNo, then row3 is 🐧, different. So count one in column3.\n\nBut what about column2?\n\nLet me see column2.\n\nColumn2:\n\n🦊 (1,2)\n\n🐧 (2,2)\n\n🎄 (3,2)\n\n🐐 (4,2)\n\nNo runs, as all are single.\n\nWhat about row3 in column3: 🐧 is (3,3), which is after two 🦊 in column3.\n\nThus, no further runs.\n\nSo, the total remains 4.\n\nI think the answer is 4.\n<\/think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more, on a given 4x4 board. The approach involves checking for runs of consecutive emojis in both rows and columns, where a \"run\" is defined as a maximal sequence of the same emoji occurring consecutively. For each run of length 2 or more, we count it as one line.\n\n### Board Representation\nThe given board is as follows:\n\n```\nRow 1: 🎄 🦊 🦊 🎄\nRow 2: 🐐 🐧 🦊 🐐\nRow 3: 🎄 🎄 🐧 🦊\nRow 4: 🐐 🐐 🦊 🐧\n```\n\n### Horizontal Runs\nFor each row, we scan from left to right to identify runs of consecutive emojis:\n\n1. **Row 1**: 🎄 🦊 🦊 🎄  \n   - A run of 2 🦊 (positions 2-3).  \n   - Contribution: 1 line.\n\n2. **Row 2**: 🐐 🐧 🦊 🐐  \n   - No runs of length 2 or more.  \n   - Contribution: 0 lines.\n\n3. **Row 3**: 🎄 🎄 🐧 🦊  \n   - A run of 2 🎄 (positions 1-2).  \n   - Contribution: 1 line.\n\n4. **Row 4**: 🐐 🐐 🦊 🐧  \n   - A run of 2 🐐 (positions 1-2).  \n   - Contribution: 1 line.\n\n**Total horizontal lines**: 1 (Row 1) + 0 (Row 2) + 1 (Row 3) + 1 (Row 4) = 3.\n\n### Vertical Runs\nFor each column, we scan from top to bottom to identify runs of consecutive emojis:\n\n1. **Column 1**: 🎄 🐐 🎄 🐐  \n   - No runs of length 2 or more.  \n   - Contribution: 0 lines.\n\n2. **Column 2**: 🦊 🐧 🎄 🐐  \n   - No runs of length 2 or more.  \n   - Contribution: 0 lines.\n\n3. **Column 3**: 🦊 🦊 🐧 🦊  \n   - A run of 2 🦊 (positions 1-2).  \n   - Contribution: 1 line.\n\n4. **Column 4**: 🎄 🐐 🦊 🐧  \n   - No runs of length 2 or more.  \n   - Contribution: 0 lines.\n\n**Total vertical lines**: 0 (Column 1) + 0 (Column 2) + 1 (Column 3) + 0 (Column 4) = 1.\n\n### Total Lines\nAdding the horizontal and vertical contributions gives the total number of lines:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total lines} = 3 \\, (\\text{horizontal}) + 1 \\, (\\text{vertical}) = 4.\n\\]\n\n**Answer: 4**"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.
