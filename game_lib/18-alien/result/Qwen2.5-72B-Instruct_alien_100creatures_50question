reproduction method of mammal, Asexual Reproduction, Viviparous, or Spore Reproduction.\n\n### Calculation Steps:\n1. **Filter the Aliens:** Identify the aliens that meet the criteria.\n2. **Count the Legs:** Sum up the total number of legs for the filtered aliens.\n\n### Step 1: Filter the Aliens\nAll the given aliens meet the horns criteria (0 to 10 horns), so we only need to filter based on the
