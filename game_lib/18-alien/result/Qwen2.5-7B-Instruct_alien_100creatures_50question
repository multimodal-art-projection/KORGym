Sum the horns of the filtered alien animals.\n\nNow, let's go through the list and count the horns of the aliens that meet both the diet and color criteria.\n\n- Scavenger: yYu (1 horn), ecfAnMu (7 horns), vkiAa (8 horns), XyNq (8 horns), kNNvLdr (0 horns), qBzoWIM (3 horns), egn (6 horns), BHtekQnL (0 horns), QGBSBl (8 horns), jfii (8 horns), ANHano (8 horns), SCFw (4 horns).\n- Herbivore: uSu (0 horns), yYu (10 horns), oerYNgmf (7 horns), yCAAqe (1 horn), vnGPN (1 horn), kgsUc (2 horns), olvGzq (0 horns), ahxbRmh (1 horn), bxKZ (1 horn), kBAFbY (8 horns).\n- Omnivore: IzUthFA (7 horns), vyXb (8 horns), rUWV (3 horns), tDgsU (8 horns).\n- Insectivore: Ekmpae (6 horns), kuS (1 horn), dCM (5 horns).\n- Parasite: SOxSjPy (1 horn), QmjM (10 horns), Kql (1 horn), eatAnMu (10 horns), rUWV (1 horn), fMgAnk (0 horns), qBzoWIM (3 horns), kBAFbY (8 horns).\n- Carnivore: GRdb (0 horns), Ekmpae (6 horns), WYgy (4 horns), Vkan (0 horns), jeAZOvtu (4 horns), ANAJjdfb (8 horns), uSa (6 horns), KNYb (3 horns), AQGBSBl (9 horns), FMgAnk (0 horns), KNNvLdr (3 horns), DZHQdFN (2 horns).\n\nNow, sum the horns:\n\n- Scavenger: 1 + 7 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 3 + 6 + 0 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 57\n- Herbivore: 0 + 10 + 7 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 8 = 31\n- Omnivore: 7 + 8 + 3 + 8 = 26\n- Insectivore: 6 + 1 + 5 = 12\n- Parasite: 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 8 = 38\n- Carnivore: 0 + 6 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 8 + 6 + 3 + 9 + 0 + 3 + 2 = 45\n\nTotal horns = 57 + 31 + 26 + 12 + 38 + 45 = 219\n\nAnswer: 219"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.
