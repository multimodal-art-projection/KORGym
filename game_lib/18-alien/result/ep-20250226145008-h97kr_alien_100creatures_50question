First, filter the original alien data according to the given criteria:\n   - **Criteria 1**: Horns can be any value from 0 - 10, so this does not eliminate any aliens as all aliens in the data have a valid number of horns in this range.\n   - **Criteria 2**: Color can be red, green, purple, orange, yellow, cyan, or blue. All aliens in the data have valid colors, so this does not eliminate any aliens.\n   - **Criteria 3**: Diet should be Omnivore or Parasite.\n   - **Criteria 4**: Reproduction should be Asexual Reproduction, oviparous, mammal, or Spore Reproduction.

animals that: 1. color are red\/purple\/yellow\/cyan\/blue; 2. horns are 0\/1\/2\/4\/5\/7\/10.","answer":"343","response":["First, we need to check each type of alien according to the two criteria: color is red, purple, yellow, cyan or blue; and the number of horns is 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 or 10. Then we calculate the total number of legs for the qualified aliens based on their quantity.\n\n1. **Alien(1): lTH**\n    - Color: yellow, Horns: 0. It meets the criteria. Quantity is 2, and legs per alien is 4. So the total legs from lTH is \\(2\\times4 = 8\\).\n2. **Alien(2): eSDLkY**\n    - Color: blue, Horns: 2. It meets the criteria. Quantity is 2, and legs per alien is 5. So the total legs from eSDLkY is \\(2\\times5 = 10\\).\n3. **Alien(3): yfYHfEv**\n    - Color: green. It does not meet the color - criteria, so we ignore it.\n4. **Alien(4): dDA**\n    - Color: red, Horns: 8. It does not meet the horn - criteria, so we ignore it.\n5. **Alien(5): lwDwzAz**\n    - Color: red, Horns: 4. It meets the criteria. Quantity is 3, and legs per alien is 7.

Then, calculate the total number of legs:\n   - For hKmb: The number of hKmb is 14, and each has 1 leg, so the total number of legs from hKmb is \\(14\\times1 = 14\\).\n   - For bBL: The number of bBL is 13, and each has 0 legs, so the total number of legs from bBL is \\(13\\times0 = 0\\).\n   - For siqWiQM: The number of siqWiQM is 6, and each has 9 legs, so the total number of legs from siqWiQM is \\(6\\times9 = 54\\).\n   - For GBAl: The number of GBAl is 9, and each has 9 legs, so the total number of legs from GBAl is \\(9\\times9 = 81\\).\n   - For gJstGYz: The number of gJstGYz is 8, and each has 0 legs, so the total number of legs from gJstGYz is \\(8\\times0 = 0\\).\n3. Finally, sum up the total number of legs:\n   - The total number of legs \\(=14 + 0+54 + 81+0=149\\).\n\nAnswer: 149"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.
