Move the player adjacent to the first box at (2, 5).\n   - Moves: right → right → right → right\n   - Player moves to (2, 5), ready to push the box.\n\n2. Push the box at (2, 5) downward to (3, 5), which is a target.\n   - Moves: down\n   - Box is now on target (3, 5).\n\n3.

The goal is to push the box from (2, 3) into (2, 5).\n\n### Step-by-Step Moves:\nLet's break the puzzle-solving process down:\n- Move the player around and position him to push the box toward the target area.\n- Push the box step by step into the target area.\n\n### Moves Derived:\n1. 'up' (player moves to (3, 3)).\n2. 'up' (player moves to (2, 3)).\n3. 'right' (player pushes the box from (2, 3) to (2, 4)).\n4. 'right' (player pushes the box from (2, 4) to (2, 5), completing the goal).\n\n### Final Answer:\nEach move is listed step by step:\n\nAnswer: ['up', 'up', 'right', 'right']"],"prompt":"\n\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

There are 4 boxes (`B`), located at positions (2,4), (3,5), (3,4), and (2,5).\n3. The target areas (`T`) are located at (1,4), (2,6), (3,3), and (4,4).\n4. Walls (`X`) block movement, and the game board is bounded by those walls.\n\n---\n\n### Solution Strategy:\nThe player will move strategically to push each box (`B`) into a target area (`T`). Since Sokoban puzzles require detailed step-by-step navigation, I will output each move necessary to solve the puzzle.\n\n---\n\n### Movements:\n\nBelow are the step-by-step movements to solve the puzzle:\n\n1. Move the player to position (2,4), near the first box:\n   - 'right'\n\n2. Push the box at (2,4) upward to (1,4), matching the target area:\n   - 'up'\n\n3. Move the player back to (2,5), near the second box:\n   - 'down'\n   - 'right'\n\n4. Push the box at (2,5) right to (2,6), matching the target area:\n   - 'right'\n\n5. Move the player to position (3,4), near the third box:\n   - 'left'\n   - 'down'\n\n6. Push the box at (3,4) left to (3,3), matching the target area:\n   - 'left'\n\n7. Move the player to position (4,4), near the fourth box:\n   - 'down'\n\n8. Push the box at (3,5) downward to (4,4), matching the target area:\n   - 'down'\n\n---\n\n### Final Solution:\nThe list of movements to solve the Sokoban puzzle is:\n\n```\n['right', 'up', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'down', 'left', 'down', 'down']\n```\n\nAnswer: ['right', 'up', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'down', 'left', 'down', 'down']"],"prompt":"\n\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Here's the solution step-by-step along with reasoning:\n\n---\n\n### Observations:\n1. The game is won when the box at position `(2,2)` reaches the target position `(2,4)` or another target area.\n2. The player starts at `(5,1)`, represented by `I` on the board.\n3. We will plan moves carefully to avoid blocking the box or making the puzzle unsolvable.\n\n---\n\n### Plan:\n1. Move the player into position to push box `B` toward the target `T`.\n2. Push the box step by step onto the target.\n3. Ensure the player can access and push the box without trapping it or invalidating the game's logic.\n\n---\n\n### Solution Steps:\nLet's move the player (`I`) and push the box (`B`) to solve the puzzle.\n\n1. **Move the player to position `(2,1)` next to the box.**\n    - Moves: `['up', 'up', 'left', 'left', 'up', 'up']`\n\n2. **Push the box `(2,2)` right toward the first target area.**\n    - Push step 1: `['right']` (box moves to `(2,3)`).\n    - Push step 2: `['right']` (box moves to `(2,4)` onto the target).\n\n---\n\n### Final List of Moves:\nCombining these into a single list gives the solution.\n\n```\n['up', 'up', 'left', 'left', 'up', 'up', 'right', 'right']\n```\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n```\nAnswer: ['up', 'up', 'left', 'left', 'up', 'up', 'right', 'right']\n```"],"prompt":"\n\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.
