We have 2 boxes and 2 target areas, so each box needs to be pushed to a specific target.\n2. I need to plan my moves carefully, avoiding pushing boxes into corners or positions from which they can't be moved.\n\nLet me start solving this:\n\nFirst, I need to analyze which box should go to which target. Since the boxes are positioned on the right and the targets are in the middle, I'll need to push both boxes leftward.\n\nLet's tackle the first box at (2, 5):\n- I'll need to move the player to the right of this box to push it left.\n- I'll need to navigate around the box at (4, 5) if necessary.\n\nFor the second box at (4, 5):\n- Similarly, I need to position the player to its right and push it leftward.\n\nLet me trace the solution step by step:\n\nStarting position:\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEEX\nXIEXEBEX\nXEEETEEX\nXXXETBEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nPlayer is at (2, 1).\n\nI'll first try to push the box at (2, 5) to the target at (3, 3).\n\n1. Move right: (2, 2)\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEEX\nXEIXEBEX\nXEEETEEX\nXXXETBEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\n2. Move right: (2, 3)\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEEX\nXEEIEBEX\nXEEETEEX\nXXXETBEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\n3. Move right: (2, 4)\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEEX\nXEEEIEBX\nXEEETEEX\nXXXETBEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\n4. Move right: (2, 5)\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEEX\nXEEEXIBX\nXEEETEEX\nXXXETBEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nHmm, there seems to be a wall between (2, 4) and (2, 5). Let me review the board again.\n\nI notice that 'E' represents empty spaces. So the map should be:\n\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEEX\nXIEXEBEX\nXEEETEEX\nXXXETBEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nPlayer is at (2, 1).\nBoxes are at (2, 5) and (4, 5).\nTargets are at (3, 3) and (4, 3).\n\nLet me retry the solution:\n\n1. Move right: (2, 2)\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEEX\nXEIXEBEX\nXEEETEEX\nXXXETBEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\n2. Move right: (2, 3)\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEEX\nXEEIEBEX\nXEEETEEX\nXXXETBEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\n3. Move right: (2, 4)\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEEX\nXEEEIEBX\nXEEETEEX\nXXXETBEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nActually, I'm making a mistake again. Let me redo the board visualization:\n\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEEX\nXIEXEBEX\nXEEETEEX\nXXXETBEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nPlayer is at (2, 1).\nFirst box is at (2, 5).\nSecond box is at (4, 5).\nTargets are at (3, 3) and (4, 3).\n\nLet me try once more:\n\n1. Move right: (2, 2)\n2. Move right: (2, 3)\n3. Move right: (2, 4)\n4. Move right (pushing the box): (2, 5), box moves to (2, 6)\n\nActually, let me try to be more careful with the coordinates. Let me re-visualize the board using (row, column) coordinates where (0, 0) is the top-left:\n\n```\n0123456\n0XXXXXXXX\n1XEEEEEEX\n2XIEXEBEX\n3XEEETEEX\n4XXXETBEX\n5XXEEEEEX\n6XXEEEEEX\n7XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nPlayer is at (2, 1).\nFirst box is at (2, 5).\nSecond box is at (4, 5).\nFirst target is at (3, 3).\nSecond target is at (4, 3).\n\nOk, I guess I should also just directly refer to the board to make sure I'm visualizing it correctly:\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEEX\nXIEXEBEX\nXEEETEEX\nXXXETBEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nLet me count again:\n- Player (I) is at row 2, column 1 (0-indexed).\n- Boxes (B) are at (2, 5) and (4, 5).\n- Targets (T) are at (3, 3) and (4, 3).\n\nLet's get started on the solution:\n\n1. I need to push the box at (2, 5) towards the target at (3, 3).\n2. To do this, I need to be at position (2, 6) to push the box leftward.\n3. I'll also need to push the box at (4, 5) towards the target at (4, 3).\n\nLet's execute the moves:\n\nInitial:\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEEX\nXIEXEBEX\nXEEETEEX\nXXXETBEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nI'll start by moving the player to position (2, 6) to push the box at (2, 5) leftward:\n1. Move right: Player at (2, 2)\n2. Move right: Player at (2, 3)\n3. Move right: Player at (2, 4)\n4. Move right (pushing the box): Player at (2, 5), box at (2, 4)\n5. Move down: Player at (3, 5)\n6. Move down: Player at (4, 5)\n7. Move left (pushing the box): Player at (4, 4), box at (4, 3) - One box at the target!\n8. Move up: Player at (3, 4)\n9. Move left: Player at (3, 3)\n10. Move up: Player at (2, 3)\n11. Move right: Player at (2, 4)\n12. Move down (pushing the box): Player at (3, 4), box at (3, 3) - Second box at the target!\n\nLet me double-check this solution by visualizing the board after each move:\n\nInitial:\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEEX\nXIEXEBEX\nXEEETEEX\nXXXETBEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\n1. Move right: Player at (2, 2)\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEEX\nXEIXEBEX\nXEEETEEX\nXXXETBEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\n2. Move right: Player at (2, 3)\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEEX\nXEEIEBEX\nXEEETEEX\nXXXETBEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\n3. Move right: Player at (2, 4)\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEEX\nXEEEIEBX\nXEEETEEX\nXXXETBEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\n4. Move right (pushing the box): Player at (2, 5), box at (2, 6)\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEEX\nXEEEEIBX\nXEEETEEX\nXXXETBEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nHmm, actually, this is not making progress towards our target. I think I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me rereview the board:\n\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEEX\nXIEXEBEX\nXEEETEEX\nXXXETBEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nOh, I see. The symbols 'E' in the board represent empty spaces, not walls. The letter 'X' represents walls.\n\nWith that clarified, I can now visualize the board correctly:\n\n- The player (I) is at row 2, column 1 (0-indexed).\n- Boxes (B) are at (2, 5) and (4, 5).\n- Targets (T) are at (3, 3) and (4, 3).\n- Walls (X) are around the perimeter and a few spots inside.\n- Empty spaces (E) are where the player can move.\n\nOk, let's restart the solution:\n\nThe goal is to push both boxes to their respective targets. I need to move the player to manipulate the boxes.\n\nInitial:\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEEX\nXIEXEBEX\nXEEETEEX\nXXXETBEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nFirst, I want to move the box at (2, 5) to the target at (3, 3):\n1. Right: Player at (2, 2)\n2. Right: Player at (2, 3)\n3. Right: Player at (2, 4)\n4. Right: Player at (2, 5) - Now I'm at the box.\n5. Left (pushing the box): Player at (2, 4), box at (2, 3)\n6. Down: Player at (3, 4)\n7. Left: Player at (3, 3)\n8. Up (pushing the box): Player at (2, 3), box at (1, 3) - This doesn't seem right.\n\nI think I made an error. Let me reconsider:\n\nI have a box at (2, 5) that I want to push to the target at (3, 3). To push it down and then left, I need to:\n1. Move to the right of the box.\n2. Push the box to the left.\n3. Go around and push it down.\n\nLet me try again:\n1. Right: Player at (2, 2)\n2. Right: Player at (2, 3)\n3. Right: Player at (2, 4)\n4. Right: Player at (2, 5) - Now I'm at the box.\n5. Right (pushing the box): Player at (2, 6), box at (2, 7) - I don't think this is right either since there's a wall (X) there.\n\nI think I'm making a mistake in interpreting the coordinates. Let me restate the board with clearer coordinate references:\n\n```\n  01234567\n0 XXXXXXXX\n1 XEEEEEEX\n2 XIEXEBEX\n3 XEEETEEX\n4 XXXETBEX\n5 XXEEEEEX\n6 XXEEEEEX\n7 XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nNow, I can see:\n- Player (I) is at (2, 1).\n- Boxes (B) are at (2, 5) and (4, 5).\n- Targets (T) are at (3, 3) and (4, 3).\n\nLet me try to solve again:\n1. Right: Player at (2, 2)\n2. Right: Player at (2, 3)\n3. Right: Player at (2, 4)\n4. Right: Player at (2, 5) - Now I'm at the box position, but that's incorrect. \n\nLet me re-review. I think I'm misreading the board. Let's say 0-indexed, the coordinate of 'I' is (2, 1). I can move right to (2, 2), which is an empty space ('E'). Moving right again to (2, 3) is also fine. But the next space at (2, 4) appears to be empty, and at (2, 5) is a box ('B'). So I can move to (2, 4) and then push the box right, but that doesn't get us closer to the targets.\n\nActually, wait. Let me count the symbols one by one:\n\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEEX\nXIEXEBEX\nXEEETEEX\nXXXETBEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nIn the third row (indexed as 2), I see:\nX I E X E B E X\n\nX at index 0, I at index 1, E at index 2, X at index 3, E at index 4, B at index 5, E at index 6, X at index 7.\n\nSo the player (I) is at (2, 1) and the box (B) is at (2, 5). The wall (X) is at (2, 3). So actually the player can't reach the box by going straight right.\n\nLet me try a different approach. If the player goes down and then right, maybe we can access the box from below?\n\nLet's try:\n1. Down: Player at (3, 1)\n2. Right: Player at (3, 2)\n3. Right: Player at (3, 3) - This is a target (T).\n4. Right: Player at (3, 4)\n5. Right: Player at (3, 5)\n6. Up: Player at (2, 5) - Now I'm to the left of the box.\n7. Right (pushing the box): Player at (2, 6), box at (2, 7) - But there's a wall (X) at (2, 7), so I can't push the box this way.\n\nThis seems challenging. Let me reconsider:\n\nThe box at (2, 5) can be pushed left if the player is at (2, 6). But I'm realizing there might not be a path to (2, 6) given the walls.\n\nLet me trace the player's movement step by step to see if there's a path to the right side of the box at (2, 5):\n\n1. Down: Player at (3, 1)\n2. Right: Player at (3, 2)\n3. Right: Player at (3, 3)\n4. Right: Player at (3, 4)\n5. Right: Player at (3, 5)\n6. Up: Player at (2, 5) - Wait, I made a mistake. This is the position of the box, not an empty space the player can move to.\n\nLet me re-read the board again:\n\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEEX\nXIEXEBEX\nXEEETEEX\nXXXETBEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nIn the third row (indexed as 2), I see:\nX I E X E B E X\n\nSo the box (B) is at (2, 5). If I want to push this box left, I need to position the player at (2, 6).\n\nLet's try again to find a path to (2, 6):\n1. Down: Player at (3, 1)\n2. Right: Player at (3, 2)\n3. Right: Player at (3, 3)\n4. Right: Player at (3, 4)\n5. Right: Player at (3, 5)\n6. Up: Player at (2, 5) - This is the position of the box, so the player can't be here.\n\nMaybe I need to approach the box from the right:\n1. Down: Player at (3, 1)\n2. Right: Player at (3, 2)\n3. Right: Player at (3, 3)\n4. Right: Player at (3, 4)\n5. Right: Player at (3, 5)\n6. Right: Player at (3, 6)\n7. Up: Player at (2, 6) - Now I'm to the right of the box.\n8. Left (pushing the box): Player at (2, 5), box at (2, 4)\n9. Left (pushing the box): Player at (2, 4), box at (2, 3) - Reached wall position. Ah wait, let me recheck. (2, 3) has 'X' so the box cannot be moved there.\n\nLet's also double-check by visualizing the row:\nX I E X E B E X\n\nYes, at (2, 3) there's a wall (X). So the box at (2, 5) can be pushed left to (2, 4) but not further.\n\nLet me continue from the position where the player is at (2, 5) and the box is at (2, 4):\n10. Down: Player at (3, 5)\n11. Left: Player at (3, 4)\n12. Left: Player at (3, 3) - One of the target positions.\n13. Down: Player at (4, 3) - Another target position.\n14. Right: Player at (4, 4)\n15. Right: Player at (4, 5) - Position of the second box.\n16. Left (pushing the box): Player at (4, 4), box at (4, 3) - Second box is now on a target!\n\nNow let's focus on getting the first box to a target. After move 16, the player is at (4, 4), one box is at (4, 3) (on a target), and the other box is at (2, 4).\n17. Up: Player at (3, 4)\n18. Up: Player at (2, 4) - Now I'm at the position of the first box.\n19. Down (pushing the box): Player at (3, 4), box at (3, 3) - First box is now on a target!\n\nGreat! Both boxes are now on targets. Let me summarize the solution to confirm:\n\n1. Down: Player at (3, 1)\n2. Right: Player at (3, 2)\n3. Right: Player at (3, 3)\n4. Right: Player at (3, 4)\n5. Right: Player at (3, 5)\n6. Right: Player at (3, 6)\n7. Up: Player at (2, 6)\n8. Left (pushing the box): Player at (2, 5), box at (2, 4)\n9. Down: Player at (3, 5)\n10. Left: Player at (3, 4)\n11. Left: Player at (3, 3)\n12. Down: Player at (4, 3)\n13. Right: Player at (4, 4)\n14. Right: Player at (4, 5)\n15. Left (pushing the box): Player at (4, 4), box at (4, 3)\n16. Up: Player at (3, 4)\n17. Up: Player at (2, 4)\n18. Down (pushing the box): Player at (3, 4), box at (3, 3)\n\nBut wait, I made a mistake in my visualization earlier. Let me recheck the board:\n\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEEX\nXIEXEBEX\nXEEETEEX\nXXXETBEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nCountng positions for row 2 (0-indexed): X is at 0, I is at 1, E is at 2, X is at 3, E is at 4, B is at 5, E is at 6, X is at 7.\n\nFor row 3: X is at 0, E is at 1, E is at 2, E is at 3, T is at 4, E is at 5, E is at 6, X is at 7.\n\nFor row 4: X is at 0, X is at 1, X is at 2, E is at 3, T is at 4, B is at 5, E is at 6, X is at 7.\n\nSo, the boxes (B) are at positions (2, 5) and (4, 5), and the targets (T) are at positions (3, 4) and (4, 4).\n\nI need to push the boxes from (2, 5) and (4, 5) to the targets at (3, 4) and (4, 4).\n\nActually, let me look at the original problem statement carefully. It says:\n\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEEX\nXIEXEBEX\nXEEETEEX\nXXXETBEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nHere, I want to count the positions of the key elements more accurately:\n\n- Player (I): Row 2, Column 1 (0-indexed)\n- First Box (B): Row 2, Column 5\n- Second Box (B): Row 4, Column 5\n- First Target (T): Row 3, Column 4\n- Second Target (T): Row 4, Column 3\n\nLet me use this to get the solution:\n\n1. Down: Player at (3, 1)\n2. Right: Player at (3, 2)\n3. Right: Player at (3, 3)\n4. Right: Player at (3, 4) - First target position\n5. Right: Player at (3, 5)\n6. Right: Player at (3, 6)\n7. Up: Player at (2, 6)\n8. Left (pushing the box): Player at (2, 5), box at (2, 4)\n9. Down: Player at (3, 5)\n10. Down: Player at (4, 5) - Second box position\n11. Left (pushing the box): Player at (4, 4), box at (4, 3) - Second box is now on the second target\n12. Up: Player at (3, 4)\n13. Left: Player at (3, 3)\n14. Up: Player at (2, 3)\n15. Right: Player at (2, 4) - First box position\n16. Down (pushing the box): Player at (3, 4), box at (4, 4) - First box is now on the first target\n\nWait, I don't think that's right. Let me reconsider:\n\nAfter step 9, the player is at (3, 5) and the first box is at (2, 4). From (3, 5), I can get to (4, 5) and then push the second box left to (4, 3). Then, I need to get back to (2, 4) to push the first box down to (3, 4). But I'm having a hard time visualizing this.\n\nLet me redraw the board after step 9 (player at (3, 5), first box at (2, 4)):\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEEX\nXIEEXBEX\nXEEETEEX\nXXXETBEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nOops, I made an error. Let me retry:\n\nInitial:\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEEX\nXIEXEBEX\nXEEETEEX\nXXXETBEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\n1. Down: Player at (3, 1)\n2. Right: Player at (3, 2)\n3. Right: Player at (3, 3)\n4. Right: Player at (3, 4) - First target\n5. Right: Player at (3, 5)\n6. Right: Player at (3, 6)\n7. Up: Player at (2, 6)\n8. Left (pushing the box): Player at (2, 5), box at (2, 4)\n\nNow the board looks like:\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEEX\nXIEXBEEX\nXEEETEEX\nXXXETBEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\n9. Down: Player at (3, 5)\n10. Down: Player at (4, 5) - Second box\n11. Left (pushing the box): Player at (4, 4), box at (4, 3) - Next to the second target (which is at (4, 4))\n\nWait, I seem to be making mistakes with the target positions. Let me re-read:\n\n\"First target (T): Row 3, Column 4\"\n\"Second target (T): Row 4, Column 3\"\n\nSo, the targets are at (3, 4) and (4, 3). Continuing:\n\n11. Left (pushing the box): Player at (4, 4), box at (4, 3) - Second box is now on the second target\n12. Up: Player at (3, 4)\n13. Up: Player at (2, 4) - First box\n14. Down (pushing the box): Player at (3, 4), box at (3, 4) - First box is now on the first target\n\nGreat! Both boxes are now on their targets. Let me summarize the solution:\n\n1. Down: Player at (3, 1)\n2. Right: Player at (3, 2)\n3. Right: Player at (3, 3)\n4. Right: Player at (3, 4) - First target\n5. Right: Player at (3, 5)\n6. Right: Player at (3, 6)\n7. Up: Player at (2, 6)\n8. Left (pushing the box): Player at (2, 5), box at (2, 4)\n9. Down: Player at (3, 5)\n10. Down: Player at (4, 5) - Second box\n11. Left (pushing the box): Player at (4, 4), box at (4, 3) - Second box is now on the second target\n12. Up: Player at (3, 4)\n13. Up: Player at (2, 4) - First box\n14. Down (pushing the box): Player at (3, 4), box at (3, 4) - First box is now on the first target\n\nBut I still feel uncertain about the exact positions. Let me double-check one more time by looking at the board character by character:\n\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEEX\nXIEXEBEX\nXEEETEEX\nXXXETBEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nRow 3 (0-indexed): X E E E T E E X\nFirst Target (T) is at (3, 4).\n\nRow 4 (0-indexed): X X X E T B E X\nSecond Target (T) is at (4, 4).\nSecond Box (B) is at (4, 5).\n\nAh, I see my mistake. Let me correct the targets:\n- First Target (T): (3, 4)\n- Second Target (T): (4, 4)\n\nLet me restart the solution with these correct positions:\n\nInitial:\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEEX\nXIEXEBEX\nXEEETEEX\nXXXETBEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\n1. Down: Player at (3, 1)\n2. Right: Player at (3, 2)\n3. Right: Player at (3, 3)\n4. Right: Player at (3, 4) - First target\n5. Right: Player at (3, 5)\n6. Right: Player at (3, 6)\n7. Up: Player at (2, 6)\n8. Left (pushing the box): Player at (2, 5), box at (2, 4)\n\nWait a second. I'm encountering a discrepancy. Let me lay out the board and carefully check at each symbol:\n\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEEX\nXIEXEBEX\nXEEETEEX\nXXXETBEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nRow 0: X X X X X X X X\nRow 1: X E E E E E E X\nRow 2: X I E X E B E X\nRow 3: X E E E T E E X\nRow 4: X X X E T B E X\nRow 5: X X E E E E E X\nRow 6: X X E E E E E X\nRow 7: X X X X X X X X\n\nNow I can see:\n- Player (I): (2, 1)\n- First Box (B): (2, 5)\n- Second Box (B): (4, 5)\n- First Target (T): (3, 4)\n- Second Target (T): (4, 4)\n\nWith this clarity, let me solve the puzzle:\n\n1. Down: Player at (3, 1)\n2. Right: Player at (3, 2)\n3. Right: Player at (3, 3)\n4. Right: Player at (3, 4) - First target\n5. Right: Player at (3, 5)\n6. Right: Player at (3, 6)\n7. Up: Player at (2, 6)\n8. Left (pushing the box): Player at (2, 5), box at (2, 4)\n9. Down: Player at (3, 5)\n10. Down: Player at (4, 5) - Second box position\n11. Left (pushing the box): Player at (4, 4), box at (4, 3) - Second box is close to the second target\n12. Right (pushing the box): Player at (4, 5), box at (4, 4) - Second box is now on the second target\n13. Up: Player at (3, 5)\n14. Left: Player at (3, 4) - First target\n15. Up: Player at (2, 4) - First box position\n16. Down (pushing the box): Player at (3, 4), box at (4, 4)\n\nWait, this doesn't quite work. I can't push the first box to the first target because the second box is already on the second target, which is blocking the way.\n\nLet me reconsider. Maybe I should solve it in a different order:\n\n1. Down: Player at (3, 1)\n2. Right: Player at (3, 2)\n3. Right: Player at (3, 3)\n4. Right: Player at (3, 4) - First target\n5. Up: Player at (2, 4)\n6. Right: Player at (2, 5) - First box position\n7. Left (pushing the box): Player at (2, 4), box at (2, 3)\n8. Left (pushing the box): Player at (2, 3), box at (2, 2) - Move the box more to the left to make space\n9. Down: Player at (3, 3)\n10. Right: Player at (3, 4) - First target\n11. Right: Player at (3, 5)\n12. Down: Player at (4, 5) - Second box position\n\nHmm, this approach is also problematic. The box at (2, 2) is now in the way. \n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n1. Down: Player at (3, 1)\n2. Right: Player at (3, 2)\n3. Right: Player at (3, 3)\n4. Right: Player at (3, 4) - First target\n5. Right: Player at (3, 5)\n6. Up: Player at (2, 5) - First box position\n7. Right (pushing the box): Player at (2, 6), box at (2, 7) - But this doesn't work because there's a wall at (2, 7).\n8. Down (pushing the box): Player at (2, 5), second box is at (4, 3) - But this doesn't work because I'm not adjacent to the second box.\n\nI think I'm making a fundamental error in visualizing the board. Let me retry.\n\nIt's possible that I'm misidentifying the elements on the board. Let me re-read the problem statement and clarify:\n\n\"'I' indicates the player's position.\"\n\"'B' indicates boxes.\"\n\"'T' indicates target areas where boxes should be moved.\"\n\"'X' indicates walls.\"\n\"'E' indicates empty spaces.\n\nWith this, let me re-identify the elements:\n\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEEX\nXIEXEBEX\nXEEETEEX\nXXXETBEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\n- Player (I): (2, 1)\n- First Box (B): (2, 5)\n- Second Box (B): (4, 5)\n- First Target (T): (3, 4)\n- Second Target (T): (4, 4)\n\nNow, let me think step by step about the solution:\n\n1. I want to push the first box at (2, 5) to the first target at (3, 4).\n2. I also want to push the second box at (4, 5) to the second target at (4, 4).\n\nFor the first part, I need to go from (2, 1) to a position where I can push the box at (2, 5) downward. Since there's a wall at (2, 3), I can't move straight from (2, 1) to (2, 6).\n\nI need to navigate around:\n1. Down: Player at (3, 1)\n2. Right: Player at (3, 2)\n3. Right: Player at (3, 3)\n4. Right: Player at (3, 4)\n5. Right: Player at (3, 5)\n6. Up: Player at (2, 5)\nHmm, but that's the position of the box. I can't move there. Let me try again:\n\n1. Down: Player at (3, 1)\n2. Right: Player at (3, 2)\n3. Right: Player at (3, 3)\n4. Right: Player at (3, 4)\n5. Right: Player at (3, 5)\n6. Right: Player at (3, 6)\n7. Up: Player at (2, 6)\n8. Left (pushing the box): Player at (2, 5), box at (2, 4)\n9. Down: Player at (3, 5)\n10. Left: Player at (3, 4)\n11. Up: Player at (2, 4)\n12. Down (pushing the box): Player at (3, 4), box at (4, 4) - This isn't right. Pushing down from (3, 4) would put the box at (4, 4), but I don't think I can push from (2, 4) to (3, 4) because there's a target at (3, 4).\n\nOk, wait. I think I'm getting confused because of the multiple elements at play. Let me re-read the problem statement:\n\n\"'T' indicates target areas where boxes should be moved.\"\n\nI think I'm misinterpreting. A target (T) doesn't block movement, it just indicates where a box should be placed. So a player can move onto a target area, and a box can be placed on a target area.\n\nWith this understanding, let me retrace the solution:\n\nInitial:\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEEX\nXIEXEBEX\nXEEETEEX\nXXXETBEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\n1. Down: Player at (3, 1)\n2. Right: Player at (3, 2)\n3. Right: Player at (3, 3)\n4. Right: Player at (3, 4) - First target\n5. Right: Player at (3, 5)\n6. Right: Player at (3, 6)\n7. Up: Player at (2, 6)\n8. Left (pushing the box): Player at (2, 5), box at (2, 4)\n9. Down: Player at (3, 5)\n10. Down: Player at (4, 5) - Position of the second box\n11. Left (pushing the box): Player at (4, 4), box at (4, 3)\n12. Right (pushing the box): Player at (4, 5), box at (4, 4) - Second box is now on the second target\n13. Up: Player at (3, 5)\n14. Left: Player at (3, 4) - First target\n15. Up: Player at (2, 4) - Position of the first box\n16. Down (pushing the box): Player at (3, 4), box at (4, 4) - But this doesn't work because the second box is already at (4, 4).\n\nI think I'm making an error in my plan. Let me step back and consider a different order of operations:\n\n1. First, push the first box at (2, 5) to the first target at (3, 4).\n2. Then, push the second box at (4, 5) to the second target at (4, 4).\n\nLet's try again:\n\n1. Down: Player at (3, 1)\n2. Right: Player at (3, 2)\n3. Right: Player at (3, 3)\n4. Right: Player at (3, 4) - First target\n5. Right: Player at (3, 5)\n6. Right: Player at (3, 6)\n7. Up: Player at (2, 6)\n8. Left (pushing the box): Player at (2, 5), box at (2, 4)\n9. Left (pushing the box): Player at (2, 4), box at (2, 3) - Now the box is further to the left\n10. Down: Player at (3, 4) - First target\n11. Left: Player at (3, 3)\n12. Up: Player at (2, 3) - Position of the first box\n13. Right (pushing the box): Player at (2, 4), box at (2, 5) - Move the box back to its original position\n14. Right (pushing the box): Player at (2, 5), box at (2, 6)\n15. Right (pushing the box): Player at (2, 6), box at (2, 7) - Oops, there's a wall at (2, 7), so this doesn't work.\n\nLet me reconsider. The wall at (2, 3) makes it challenging to maneuver the first box. But I can push it down from (2, 5) to (3, 5), and then move it to the target at (3, 4):\n\n1. Down: Player at (3, 1)\n2. Right: Player at (3, 2)\n3. Right: Player at (3, 3)\n4. Right: Player at (3, 4) - First target\n5. Right: Player at (3, 5)\n6. Right: Player at (3, 6)\n7. Up: Player at (2, 6)\n8. Left (pushing the box): Player at (2, 5), box at (2, 4)\n9. Down: Player at (3, 5)\n10. Left: Player at (3, 4) - First target\n11. Up: Player at (2, 4) - Position of the first box\n12. Down (pushing the box): Player at (3, 4), box at (4, 4) - But this is the position of the second target.\n\nWait, I think I'm confused about the number of boxes and targets. Let me clarify:\n\nThe board has:\n- 2 boxes at (2, 5) and (4, 5).\n- 2 targets at (3, 4) and (4, 4).\n\nI want to push each box to a target. It doesn't matter which box goes to which target, as long as all boxes are on targets.\n\nWith this in mind, let me try a simpler approach:\n\n1. Push the first box at (2, 5) to the first target at (3, 4).\n2. Push the second box at (4, 5) to the second target at (4, 4).\n\nStep 1: Push the first box at (2, 5) to the first target at (3, 4):\n1. Down: Player at (3, 1)\n2. Right: Player at (3, 2)\n3. Right: Player at (3, 3)\n4. Right: Player at (3, 4) - First target\n5. Right: Player at (3, 5)\n6. Right: Player at (3, 6)\n7. Up: Player at (2, 6)\n8. Left (pushing the box): Player at (2, 5), box at (2, 4)\n9. Down: Player at (3, 5)\n10. Left: Player at (3, 4) - First target\n11. Up: Player at (2, 4) - Position of the first box\n12. Down (pushing the box): Player at (3, 4), box at (4, 4) - But this is the position of the second target.\n\nActually, it seems like my approach is flawed. The first box at (2, 5) needs to go to the first target at (3, 4), not (4, 4).\n\nLet me simplify even further:\n1. I want to push the box at (2, 5) down one row to the target at (3, 4).\n2. I want to push the box at (4, 5) left one column to the target at (4, 4).\n\nFor the first task, I need to position the player above the box and push down:\n1. I need to navigate around to (2, 6) to push the box from (2, 5) to (2, 4). Then, I need to get to (2, 4) to push the box down to (3, 4).\n\nLet's try this:\n\n1. Down: Player at (3, 1)\n2. Right: Player at (3, 2)\n3. Right: Player at (3, 3)\n4. Right: Player at (3, 4) - First target\n5. Right: Player at (3, 5)\n6. Right: Player at (3, 6)\n7. Up: Player at (2, 6)\n8. Left (pushing the box): Player at (2, 5), box at (2, 4)\n9. Down: Player at (3, 5)\n10. Left: Player at (3, 4) - First target\n11. Up: Player at (2, 4) - Position of the first box\n12. Down (pushing the box): Player at (3, 4), box at (4, 4) - Wait, that's not right. Pushing the box from (2, 4) would move it to (3, 4), not (4, 4).\n\nLet me try again:\n\n1. Down: Player at (3, 1)\n2. Right: Player at (3, 2)\n3. Right: Player at (3, 3)\n4. Right: Player at (3, 4) - First target\n5. Right: Player at (3, 5)\n6. Right: Player at (3, 6)\n7. Up: Player at (2, 6)\n8. Left (pushing the box): Player at (2, 5), box at (2, 4)\n9. Down: Player at (3, 5)\n10. Left: Player at (3, 4) - First target\n11. Up: Player at (2, 4) - Position of the first box\n12. Down (pushing the box): Player at (3, 4), box at (3, 4) - First box is now on the first target\n\nGreat, first task complete. Now for the second task:\n13. Right: Player at (3, 5)\n14. Down: Player at (4, 5) - Position of the second box\n15. Left (pushing the box): Player at (4, 4), box at (4, 3)\n16. Right (pushing the box): Player at (4, 5), box at (4, 4) - Second box is now on the second target\n\nWait, there's a discrepancy. After step 12, the first box is on the first target at (3, 4), and the player is at (3, 4) as well. But a player and a box can't occupy the same space. Let me recheck my reasoning.\n\nOk, I think I'm misunderstanding how pushing works. When a player pushes a box, the player replaces the position of the box, and the box moves one step in the direction of the push.\n\nSo after step 11, the player is at (2, 4) and the first box is also at (2, 4), which can't be right. Let me reexamine:\n\nAfter step 8, the player is at (2, 5), and the first box is at (2, 4).\n9. Down: Player at (3, 5)\n10. Left: Player at (3, 4) - First target\n11. Up: Player at (2, 4) - This can't be right because the first box is already at (2, 4).\n\nI think I'm misremembering the state after step 8. Let me retrace carefully:\n\n1. Down: Player at (3, 1)\n2. Right: Player at (3, 2)\n3. Right: Player at (3, 3)\n4. Right: Player at (3, 4) - First target\n5. Right: Player at (3, 5)\n6. Right: Player at (3, 6)\n7. Up: Player at (2, 6)\n8. Left (pushing the box): Player at (2, 5), box at (2, 4) - I'm confused because if I push left from (2, 6), the box at (2, 5) would move to (2, 4), and the player would move to (2, 5).\n\nI think I'm misunderstanding the layout. Let me reclarify:\n\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEEX\nXIEXEBEX\nXEEETEEX\nXXXETBEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```# Solving the Sokoban Puzzle\n\nLooking at the game board, I need to find a sequence of moves to push both boxes onto the target areas.\n\nInitial state:\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEEX\nXIEXEBEX\nXEEETEEX\nXXXETBEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nI can see:\n- Player (I) at row 2, column 1\n- Two boxes (B): one at (2,5) and another at (4,5)\n- Two targets (T): one at (3,4) and another at (4,3)\n\nLet me work out a solution step by step:\n\n1. First, I'll move the player to get in position to push the box at (2,5):\n   - I need to go around the wall at (2,3) and reach position (2,6)\n\n2. Then I'll push that box to a position where I can eventually push it to the first target.\n\n3. Finally, I'll position the second box onto the second target.\n\n## Solution sequence:\n\n1. `down` - Move to (3,1)\n2. `right` - Move to (3,2)\n3. `right` - Move to (3,3)\n4. `right` - Move to (3,4)\n5. `right` - Move to (3,5)\n6. `right` - Move to (3,6)\n7. `up` - Move to (2,6)\n8. `left` - Push box from (2,5) to (2,4)\n9. `down` - Move to (3,4)\n10. `up` - Move to (2,4)\n11. `down` - Push the first box from (2,4) to (3,4) (onto first target)\n12. `down` - Move to (4,4)\n13. `right` - Move to (4,5)\n14. `left` - Push the second box from (4,5) to (4,4)\n15. `right` - Move to (4,5)\n16. `down` - Move to (5,5)\n17. `up` - Move to (4,5)\n18. `left` - Push the box from (4,4) to (4,3) (onto second target)\n\nNow both boxes are on the target areas. The first box is at (3,4) and the second box is at (4,3).\n\nAnswer: ['down','right','right','right','right','right','up','left','down','up','down','down','right','left','right','down','up','left']"],"prompt":"\n\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Push the box to the target.\n\nLet's work out the solution step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll convert the board into a 2D grid to make it easier to reason about:\n\n```\n(0,0)(0,1)(0,2)(0,3)(0,4)(0,5)(0,6)(0,7)\n(1,0)(1,1)(1,2)(1,3)(1,4)(1,5)(1,6)(1,7)\n(2,0)(2,1)(2,2)(2,3)(2,4)(2,5)(2,6)(2,7)\n(3,0)(3,1)(3,2)(3,3)(3,4)(3,5)(3,6)(3,7)\n(4,0)(4,1)(4,2)(4,3)(4,4)(4,5)(4,6)(4,7)\n(5,0)(5,1)(5,2)(5,3)(5,4)(5,5)(5,6)(5,7)\n(6,0)(6,1)(6,2)(6,3)(6,4)(6,5)(6,6)(6,7)\n(7,0)(7,1)(7,2)(7,3)(7,4)(7,5)(7,6)(7,7)\n```\n\nNow, let's mark the key positions:\n- Player (I): (4, 3)\n- Box (B): (3, 3)\n- Target (T): (3, 4)\n\nThe box (B) is directly above the player (I), and the target (T) is to the right of the box. \n\nNow, I need to figure out how to move the player to push the box onto the target. Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. I can't push the box directly from below since that would push it away from the target.\n2. I need to get to the left of the box to push it right onto the target.\n\nLet's see how to do this:\n1. Move left (now at (4, 2))\n2. Move up (now at (3, 2))\n3. Move right (now at (3, 3), pushing the box to (3, 4))\n\nBut wait, the box is already at (3, 3) and the target is at (3, 4), and I'm starting at (4, 3). Let me double-check my understanding of the board.\n\nI'll redraw the board to make sure I understand it correctly:\n\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nX     XX\nX X    X\nX  BT  X\nX  I   X\nX    X X\nX  X  XX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nSo:\n- The player (I) is at (4, 3).\n- The box (B) is at (3, 2).\n- The target (T) is at (3, 3).\n\nLet's now solve the puzzle:\n\n1. The player needs to get to a position where they can push the box toward the target. Since the box is to the left of the target, the player needs to be to the left of the box to push it right.\n\n2. The player can move left, then up, to get to the left of the box. Then, push the box right onto the target.\n\nHere's the sequence of moves:\n1. left (now at (4, 2))\n2. up (now at (3, 2), which is the box position... wait, this doesn't work)\n\nLet me check again. I might have misunderstood the board layout. I thought the player was at (4, 3), but maybe it's at a different position.\n\nLet's try to interpret the board once more:\n\n```\n01234567 (columns)\n0 XXXXXXXX\n1 XEEEEEXX\n2 XEXEEEEX\n3 XEEBTEEX\n4 XEEIEEEX\n5 XEEEEXEX\n6 XEEXEEXX\n7 XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nSo:\n- The player (I) is at (4, 3). (4th row, 3rd column, 0-indexed)\n- The box (B) is at (3, 3). (3rd row, 3rd column, 0-indexed)\n- The target (T) is at (3, 4). (3rd row, 4th column, 0-indexed)\n\nLet's consider a different notation for clarity:\n- (row, column)\n\nSo:\n- The player (I) is at position (4, 3).\n- The box (B) is at position (3, 3).\n- The target (T) is at position (3, 4).\n\nOk, I think the issue was with my mistake in the box and target positions. Let's try to solve the puzzle again with the corrected positions:\n\n1. The player is below the box.\n2. The target is to the right of the box.\n3. The player needs to get to the left of the box to push it right onto the target.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n1. Move left (to position (4, 2))\n2. Move up (to position (3, 2))\n3. Move right (to position (3, 3), which pushes the box to (3, 4))\n\nBut let's double-check if this plan works:\nIf the player is at (4, 3) and moves left, they end up at (4, 2). Then, if they move up, they end up at (3, 2). If they move right, they end up at (3, 3) and push the box to (3, 4). This checks out.\n\nSo, the solution is:\n- left\n- up\n- right\n\nBut let's double check the board format one more time:\n\n```\n01234567 (columns)\n0 XXXXXXXX\n1 X     XX\n2 X X    X\n3 X  BT  X\n4 X  I   X\n5 X    X X\n6 X  X  XX\n7 XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nOk, there's a problem with my interpretation of the game board. I've been assuming 'E' means an empty space. Let me reinterpret the board with this understanding.\n\nHere's the board again:\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEXX\nXEXEEEEX\nXEEBTEEX\nXEEIEEEX\nXEEEEXEX\nXEEXEEXX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nIf 'E' means an empty space, then:\n- Player (I) is at position (4, 3) (4th row, 3rd column, 0-indexed).\n- Box (B) is at position (3, 3) (3rd row, 3rd column, 0-indexed).\n- Target (T) is at position (3, 4) (3rd row, 4th column, 0-indexed).\n\nWith these positions, the player is below the box, and the target is to the right of the box. The player needs to move left, then up, then right to push the box onto the target.\n\nSo, the solution is:\n- left\n- up\n- right\n\nBut wait, I notice that there's a box (B) and a target (T) adjacent to each other in the board. Let's double-check the exact positions.\n\nI am considering the position (0, 0) to be the top-left corner of the board and (7, 7) to be the bottom-right corner. In this coordinate system, the rows increase as we move down, and the columns increase as we move right.\n\nUsing this convention:\n- Player (I) is at (4, 3).\n- Box (B) is at (3, 3).\n- Target (T) is at (3, 4).\n\nWith these positions, the player is below the box. The player needs to move to a position where they can push the box onto the target. Since the target is to the right of the box, the player needs to be to the left of the box to push it right onto the target.\n\nLet's go through the solution step by step:\n1. Move left to position (4, 2).\n2. Move up to position (3, 2).\n3. Move right to position (3, 3), pushing the box to (3, 4).\n\nThis sequence pushes the box onto the target and solves the puzzle.\n\nSo, the solution is:\n- left\n- up\n- right\n\nLet me confirm this by validating the logic one more time:\n\n1. Initially:\n   - Player (I) is at (4, 3).\n   - Box (B) is at (3, 3).\n   - Target (T) is at (3, 4).\n\n2. Player moves left:\n   - Player (I) is now at (4, 2).\n   - Box (B) is still at (3, 3).\n   - Target (T) is still at (3, 4).\n\n3. Player moves up:\n   - Player (I) is now at (3, 2).\n   - Box (B) is still at (3, 3).\n   - Target (T) is still at (3, 4).\n\n4. Player moves right:\n   - Player (I) tries to move to (3, 3), but there's a box there.\n   - Box (B) is pushed to (3, 4), which is the target position.\n   - Player (I) is now at (3, 3).\n   - Target (T) is still at (3, 4), now occupied by the Box (B).\n\nGreat! The box is now on the target, which satisfies the winning condition of the game. The solution is:\n- left\n- up\n- right# Sokoban Puzzle Analysis\n\nLooking at the game board, I need to push the box (B) onto the target (T) area.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the board:\n```\nXXXXXXXX  (X = Walls)\nXEEEEEXX  (E = Empty spaces)\nXEXEEEEX\nXEEBTEEX  (B = Box, T = Target)\nXEEIEEEX  (I = Player)\nXEEEEXEX\nXEEXEEXX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nI can see that:\n- The player (I) is directly below the box\n- The target (T) is to the right of the box\n- I need to push the box horizontally to the right\n\n## Solution Strategy\n\nTo push the box onto the target, I need to:\n1.

First, let's understand the board:\n\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXTEBEEEX\nXEXEEEEX\nXEEIEBEX\nXEBEEEXX\nXEEEEETX\nXETEEEXX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nWhere:\n- 'I' is the player's position\n- 'B' are boxes\n- 'T' are target areas\n- 'X' are walls\n- 'E' seems to be empty spaces (not mentioned in the legend, but I'll assume they're empty)\n\nLet me first identify all the elements in the puzzle:\n\nPlayer (I) position: Row 3, Column 4 (if counting from 0)\nBoxes (B): \n- Row 1, Column 3\n- Row 3, Column 6\n- Row 4, Column 2\nTarget areas (T):\n- Row 1, Column 1\n- Row 5, Column 6\n- Row 6, Column 1\n\nI notice there are 3 boxes and 3 target areas, so we need to push each box into a target area.\n\nNow, let me develop a solution. This requires careful planning as Sokoban puzzles can easily become unsolvable if boxes are pushed into corners or against walls without a way to move them.\n\nLet's start by visualizing the current state:\n\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXTEBEEEX\nXEXEEEEX\nXEEIEBEX\nXEBEEEXX\nXEEEEETX\nXETEEEXX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nThe key challenge is that we need to avoid pushing boxes into positions where they can't be moved toward a target. Let me think through a solution step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll identify which box to move to which target:\n- Box at (1,3) seems closest to target at (1,1)\n- Box at (3,6) could go to target at (5,6)\n- Box at (4,2) could go to target at (6,1)\n\nLet's start solving:\n\n1. First box: Let's move the box at (1,3) to target at (1,1).\n   - I need to get above the box, so I'll move left, up, right\n   - Then push the box left twice.\n\n2. Second box: Let's move the box at (3,6) to target at (5,6).\n   - I need to get left of the box, then push it right, down, right again.\n\n3. Third box: Let's move the box at (4,2) to target at (6,1).\n   - I need to get above the box, then push it down, left, down again.\n\nLet me start implementing this plan:\n\nStarting position:\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXTEBEEEX\nXEXEEEEX\nXEEIEBEX\nXEBEEEXX\nXEEEEETX\nXETEEEXX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nWait, let me double-check the coordinates I'm using. Actually let me number them to be sure:\n\n```\n  01234567\n0 XXXXXXXX\n1 XTEBEEEX\n2 XEXEEEEX\n3 XEEIEBEX\n4 XEBEEEXX\n5 XEEEEETX\n6 XETEEEXX\n7 XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nSo I have:\n- Player (I) at (3,3)\n- Boxes (B) at (1,2), (3,5), (4,1)\n- Targets (T) at (1,1), (5,6), (6,1)\n\nNow let me revise my plan:\n\n1. First box: Let's move the box at (1,2) to target at (1,1).\n   - I need to get above the box, so I'll move left, up, right\n   - Then push the box left.\n\n2. Second box: Let's move the box at (3,5) to target at (5,6).\n   - I need to get left of the box, then push it right, down, right again.\n\n3. Third box: Let's move the box at (4,1) to target at (6,1).\n   - I need to get above the box, then push it down, left, down twice.\n\nLet's start implementing:\n\nFrom initial position (3,3):\n- Need to get to (1,3) to push the first box\n\n1. Move: up (now at (2,3))\n2. Move: up (now at (1,3))\n3. Push: left (player at (1,2), box at (1,1)) - Box 1 is now on target!\n\nNow for box 2 at (3,5):\n- Need to get to (3,4) to push it\n\n4. Move: down (now at (2,2))\n5. Move: down (now at (3,2))\n6. Move: right (now at (3,3))\n7. Move: right (now at (3,4))\n8. Push: right (player at (3,5), box at (3,6))\n9. Move: down (now at (4,5))\n10. Move: down (now at (5,5))\n11. Push: right (player at (5,6), box at (5,7)) - Wait, that's off the board. Something's wrong with my plan or understanding of the layout.\n\nLet me reexamine the board more carefully:\n\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXTEBEEEX\nXEXEEEEX\nXEEIEBEX\nXEBEEEXX\nXEEEEETX\nXETEEEXX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nI think I made a mistake in my box locations. Let's identify them again:\n\nPlayer (I) at (3,3)\nBoxes (B) at:\n- (1,2) from `XTEBEEEX`\n- (3,5) from `XEEIEBEX`\n- (4,1) from `XEBEEEXX`\n\nTarget areas (T) at:\n- (1,1) from `XTEBEEEX`\n- (5,5) from `XEEEEETX`\n- (6,1) from `XETEEEXX`\n\nLet me correct my plan:\n\n1. First box: Move box at (1,2) to target at (1,1)\n2. Second box: Move box at (3,5) to target at (5,5)\n3. Third box: Move box at (4,1) to target at (6,1)\n\nLet's give it another try:\n\nFrom initial position (3,3):\n1. Move: up (now at (2,3))\n2. Move: up (now at (1,3))\n3. Push: left (player at (1,2), box at (1,1)) - Box 1 is now on target!\n\nNow for box 2 at (3,5):\n4. Move: down (now at (2,2))\n5. Move: down (now at (3,2))\n6. Move: right (now at (3,3))\n7. Move: right (now at (3,4))\n8. Push: right (player at (3,5), box at (3,6))\n9. Move: down (now at (4,5))\n10. Move: down (now at (5,5))\n11. Push: right (player at (5,6), box at (5,7)) - This is out of bounds again.\n\nHmm, let me double-check the board again and make sure I'm reading it correctly.\n\nWait, I think I'm still reading the indices incorrectly. Let me number them again but be more explicit:\n\n```\n    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n  +-----------------\n0 | X X X X X X X X\n1 | X T E B E E E X\n2 | X E X E E E E X\n3 | X E E I E B E X\n4 | X E B E E E X X\n5 | X E E E E E T X\n6 | X E T E E E X X\n7 | X X X X X X X X\n```\n\nSo the elements are:\n- Player (I) at position (3,3)\n- Boxes (B) at positions (1,3), (3,5), (4,2)\n- Target areas (T) at positions (1,1), (5,5), (6,1)\n\nNow let me plan again:\n\n1. Box at (1,3) to target at (1,1): Need to get to position (1,2) to push it left.\n2. Box at (3,5) to target at (5,5): Need to get to position (3,4) to push it right, then down.\n3. Box at (4,2) to target at (6,1): Need to get to position (3,2) to push it down, then left, then down.\n\nLet's solve:\n\nStarting with the player at (3,3):\n\n1. Move: left (now at (3,2))\n2. Move: up (now at (2,2))\n3. Move: right (now at (2,3))\n4. Move: up (now at (1,3))\n5. Push: left (player at (1,2), box at (1,1)) - Box 1 is now on target!\n\nNow for box 2 at (3,5):\n6. Move: down (now at (2,2))\n7. Move: down (now at (3,2))\n8. Move: right (now at (3,3))\n9. Move: right (now at (3,4))\n10. Push: right (player at (3,5), box at (3,6))\n11. Move: down (now at (4,5))\n12. Move: down (now at (5,5))\n13. Push: right (player at (5,6), box at (5,7)) - But there's no position (5,7), this is wrong.\n\nI think I'm stil getting confused with the board. Let's try once more.\n\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXTEBEEEX\nXEXEEEEX\nXEEIEBEX\nXEBEEEXX\nXEEEEETX\nXETEEEXX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nLet me redraw this with explicit positions:\n```\n    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n  +-----------------\n0 | X X X X X X X X\n1 | X T E B E E E X\n2 | X E X E E E E X\n3 | X E E I E B E X\n4 | X E B E E E X X\n5 | X E E E E E T X\n6 | X E T E E E X X\n7 | X X X X X X X X\n```\n\nOk, now I understand. When I say position (i,j), I mean row i, column j, starting from 0.\n\nPlayer (I) is at (3,3)\nBoxes (B) are at:\n- (1,3)\n- (3,5)\n- (4,2)\nTarget areas (T) are at:\n- (1,1)\n- (5,6)\n- (6,2)\n\nLet me plan the solution one more time:\n\n1. First box: Move box at (1,3) to target at (1,1)\n   - Need to get to (1,2) to push the box to (1,1)\n\n2. Second box: Move box at (3,5) to target at (5,6)\n   - Need to get to (3,4) to push it right, then navigate to (4,5) to push it down, then (5,5) to push it right\n\n3. Third box: Move box at (4,2) to target at (6,2)\n   - Need to get to (3,2) to push it down, then navigate to (5,2) to push it down.\n\nLet's start solving:\n\nStarting with player at (3,3):\n\n1. Move: up (now at (2,3))\n2. Move: up (now at (1,3))\n3. Push: left (player at (1,2), box at (1,1)) - Box 1 is now on target!\n\nNow for box 2 at (3,5):\n4. Move: down (now at (2,2))\n5. Move: down (now at (3,2))\n6. Move: right (now at (3,3))\n7. Move: right (now at (3,4))\n8. Push: right (player at (3,5), box at (3,6))\n9. Move: down (now at (4,5))\n10. Push: down (player at (5,5), box at (5,6)) - Box 2 is now on target!\n\nNow for box 3 at (4,2):\n11. Move: left (now at (5,4))\n12. Move: left (now at (5,3))\n13. Move: left (now at (5,2))\n14. Move: up (now at (4,2))\n15. Push: left (player at (4,1), box at (4,0)) - Wait, that's a wall. My coordinates are still off.\n\nLet me try again with a clearer view of the board:\n\n```\n01234567\n0XXXXXXXX\n1XTEBEEEX\n2XEXEEEEX\n3XEEIEBEX\n4XEBEEEXX\n5XEEEEETX\n6XETEEEXX\n7XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nPlayer (I) at (3,3)\nBoxes (B) at:\n- (1,3)\n- (3,5)\n- (4,2)\nTarget areas (T) at:\n- (1,1)\n- (5,6)\n- (6,2)\n\nRevised solution:\n\nStarting with player at (3,3):\n\n1. Move: up (now at (2,3))\n2. Move: up (now at (1,3))\n3. Push: left (player at (1,2), box at (1,1)) - Box 1 is now on target!\n\nNow for box 2 at (3,5):\n4. Move: down (now at (2,2))\n5.

Move: down (now at (5,5))\n11. Push: right (player at (5,6), box at (5,7)) - Wait, that's off the board.\n\nI think I'm still making an error in reading the board. Let me try again but ensure I'm understanding the correct positions.\n\nLet me redraw the board with indices and ensure I'm understanding it correctly:\n\n```\n    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n    ----------------\n0 | X X X X X X X X\n1 | X T E B E E E X\n2 | X E X E E E E X\n3 | X E E I E B E X\n4 | X E B E E E X X\n5 | X E E E E E T X\n6 | X E T E E E X X\n7 | X X X X X X X X\n```\n\nPlayer (I) at (3,3)\nBoxes (B) at:\n- (1,3)\n- (3,5)\n- (4,2)\nTarget areas (T) at:\n- (1,1)\n- (5,6)\n- (6,2)\n\nLet me now try solving it again:\n\n1. First box: Move box at (1,3) to target at (1,1)\n   - Need to get to (1,2) to push the box left\n\n2. Second box: Move box at (3,5) to target at (5,6)\n   - Need to get to (3,4) to push it right, then navigate to push it down and right\n\n3. Third box: Move box at (4,2) to target at (6,2)\n   - Need to get to (3,2) to push it down, then navigate to push it down again\n\nStarting with player at (3,3):\n\n1. Move: left (now at (3,2))\n2. Move: up (now at (2,2)) - Oops, there's a wall at (2,2). Let me check the board again.\n\nHmm, let me reexamine the board more carefully:\n\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXTEBEEEX\nXEXEEEEX\nXEEIEBEX\nXEBEEEXX\nXEEEEETX\nXETEEEXX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nY-axis (rows):\n0: XXXXXXXX\n1: XTEBEEEX - There's a box at (1,3)\n2: XEXEEEEX - There's a wall at (2,2)\n3: XEEIEBEX - Player at (3,3), box at (3,5)\n4: XEBEEEXX - Box at (4,2)\n5: XEEEEETX - Target at (5,6)\n6: XETEEEXX - Target at (6,2)\n7: XXXXXXXX\n\nTargets (T) at:\n- (1,1)\n- (5,6)\n- (6,2)\n\nLet me revise my solution:\n\nStarting with player at (3,3):\n1. Move: left (now at (3,2))\n2. Move: up (now at (2,3)) - Can't go to (2,2) because there's a wall\n3. Move: up (now at (1,3))\n4. Push: left (player at (1,2), box at (1,1)) - Box 1 is now on target!\n\nNow for box 2 at (3,5):\n5. Move: down (now at (2,3))\n6. Move: down (now at (3,3))\n7. Move: right (now at (3,4))\n8. Push: right (player at (3,5), box at (3,6))\n9. Move: down (now at (4,5))\n10. Move: down (now at (5,5))\n11. Push: right (player at (5,6), box at (5,7)) - Hmm, this is off the board. Let me check again.\n\nI think I need to be more careful about the box positions:\n\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXTEBEEEX  - Box at position (1,3)\nXEXEEEEX\nXEEIEBEX  - Player at (3,3), Box at position (3,5)\nXEBEEEXX  - Box at position (4,2)\nXEEEEETX  - Target at position (5,6)\nXETEEEXX  - Target at position (6,2)\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nFor box 2, I need to push it from (3,5) to (5,6), but I can't push it directly right because it would go off the board. So I need to:\n- Push it right once to (3,6)\n- Then down to (4,6)\n- Then down to (5,6)\n\nLet me revise my solution for box 2:\n\n8. Push: right (player at (3,5), box at (3,6))\n9. Move: right (now at (3,6))\n10. Push: down (player at (4,6), box at (5,6)) - Box 2 is now on target!\n\nNow for box 3 at (4,2):\n11. Move: left (now at (4,5))\n12. Move: left (now at (4,4))\n13. Move: left (now at (4,3))\n14. Move: left (now at (4,2))\n15. Push: left (player at (4,1), box at (4,0)) - This is a wall, so not right.\n\nLet me check the positions again:\n\n```\n01234567\n0XXXXXXXX\n1XTEBEEEX\n2XEXEEEEX\n3XEEIEBEX\n4XEBEEEXX\n5XEEEEETX\n6XETEEEXX\n7XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nBox 3 is at (4,2), and I need to push it to (6,2).\n\nFor box 3:\n- I need to push it down from (4,2) to (5,2)\n- Then down again to (6,2)\n\n15. Move: up (now at (3,2))\n16. Push: down (player at (4,2), box at (5,2))\n17. Push: down (player at (5,2), box at (6,2)) - Box 3 is now on target!\n\nLet me check if I solved all three boxes:\n- Box 1: Pushed to (1,1) ✓\n- Box 2: Pushed to (5,6) ✓\n- Box 3: Pushed to (6,2) ✓\n\nBut I feel like I'm still making a mistake somewhere. Let me trace the whole solution again to be sure:\n\nStarting with player at (3,3):\n\n1. Move: left (now at (3,2))\n2. Move: up (now at (2,3))\n3. Move: up (now at (1,3))\n4. Push: left (player at (1,2), box at (1,1)) - Box 1 is on target!\n\nNow for box 2 at (3,5):\n5. Move: down (now at (2,2)) - Can't move to (2,2) because there's a wall there!\n\nOk, let me revise the path:\n\n1. Move: left (now at (3,2))\n2. Move: up (now at (2,3)) - OK\n3. Move: up (now at (1,3)) - OK\n4. Push: left (player at (1,2), box at (1,1)) - Box 1 is on target!\n\nNow a different path for box 2:\n5. Move: down (now at (2,3))\n6. Move: down (now at (3,3))\n7. Move: right (now at (3,4))\n8. Push: right (player at (3,5), box at (3,6))\n9. Move: right (now at (3,6))\n10. Push: down (player at (4,6), box at (5,6)) - Box 2 is now on target!\n\nNow for box 3 at (4,2):\n11. Move: left (now at (4,5))\n12. Move: left (now at (4,4))\n13. Move: left (now at (4,3))\n14. Move: left (now at (4,2))\n15. Push: down (player at (5,2), box at (6,2)) - Box 3 is now on target!\n\nThat looks good! Let me walk through it once more to trace and make sure:\n\nPlayer starts at (3,3).\n\n1. Move: left to (3,2)\n2. Move: up to (2,3)\n3. Move: up to (1,3)\n4. Push: left - Player to (1,2), Box 1 to (1,1) - On target!\n\n5. Move: down to (2,3)\n6. Move: down to (3,3)\n7. Move: right to (3,4)\n8. Push: right - Player to (3,5), Box 2 to (3,6)\n9. Move: right to (3,6)\n10. Push: down - Player to (4,6), Box 2 to (5,6) - On target!\n\n11. Move: left to (4,5)\n12. Move: left to (4,4)\n13. Move: left to (4,3)\n14. Move: left to (4,2)\n15. Push: down - Player to (5,2), Box 3 to (6,2) - On target!\n\nWait, going back to box 3, I need to be at (4,1) to push the box at (4,2) downward, not at (4,2) itself. Let me revise this part:\n\n11. Move: left to (4,5)\n12. Move: left to (4,4)\n13. Move: left to (4,3)\n14. Move: left to (4,2)\n\nWait, that's not right. If I'm at (4,2), which is where box 3 is, I can't move to that position. Let me redo this part:\n\n11. Move: left to (4,5)\n12. Move: left to (4,4)\n13. Move: left to (4,3)\n14. Move: left to (4,2) - This is where box 3 is, so I can't be here. I need to be at (3,2).\n\n11. Move: left to (4,5)\n12. Move: left to (4,4)\n13. Move: left to (4,3)\n14. Move: left to (4,2) - Can't move here, there's a box.\n\nLet me reconsider the path:\n\nAfter pushing box 2 to target (5,6), the player is at (4,6). To push box 3 from (4,2) to (6,2), I need to:\n- Get to position (3,2) to push it downward\n- Then move to (5,2) to push it downward again\n\n11. Move: left to (4,5)\n12. Move: left to (4,4)\n13. Move: left to (4,3)\n14. Move: up to (3,3)\n15. Move: left to (3,2)\n16. Push: down - Player to (4,2), Box 3 to (5,2)\n17. Push: down - Player to (5,2), Box 3 to (6,2) - On target!\n\nLet me trace through once more:\n\nPlayer starts at (3,3).\n\n1. Move: left to (3,2)\n2. Move: up to (2,3)\n3. Move: up to (1,3)\n4. Push: left - Player to (1,2), Box 1 to (1,1) - On target!\n\n5. Move: down to (2,3)\n6. Move: down to (3,3)\n7. Move: right to (3,4)\n8. Push: right - Player to (3,5), Box 2 to (3,6)\n9. Move: right to (3,6)\n10. Push: down - Player to (4,6), Box 2 to (5,6) - On target!\n\n11. Move: left to (4,5)\n12. Move: left to (4,4)\n13. Move: left to (4,3)\n14. Move: up to (3,3)\n15. Move: left to (3,2)\n16. Push: down - Player to (4,2), Box 3 to (5,2)\n17. Push: down - Player to (5,2), Box 3 to (6,2) - On target!\n\nThat seems right! All boxes are now on targets. Let me summarize the solution:\n\n1. left\n2. up\n3. up\n4. left\n5. down\n6. down\n7. right\n8. right\n9. right\n10. down\n11. left\n12. left\n13. left\n14. up\n15. left\n16. down\n17. down\n\nWith this solution, all three boxes should be on targets.\n\nBut, I need to double-check the last push. After pushing the box from (4,2) to (5,2), I would be at (5,2), and then to push it to (6,2), I need to push it down again. I need to ensure that this works.\n\nActually, I think I should push the box from (4,2) to (5,2), then get to position (5,1) to push it right to (5,2).

First, I'll move the box at (1,3) to the target at (1,1)\n2. Then the box at (3,5) to the target at (5,6)\n3. Finally, the box at (4,2) to the target at (6,2)\n\nHere's my solution:\n\nStep 1: Move box at (1,3) to target at (1,1)\n- Move left from (3,3) to (3,2)\n- Move up to (2,3)\n- Move up to (1,3)\n- Push the box left to (1,1)\n\nStep 2: Move box at (3,5) to target at (5,6)\n- Move down to (2,3)\n- Move down to (3,3)\n- Move right to (3,4)\n- Push the box right to (3,6)\n- Move right to (3,6)\n- Push the box down to (4,6)\n- Push the box down to (5,6)\n\nStep 3: Move box at (4,2) to target at (6,2)\n- Move left to (5,5)\n- Move left to (5,4)\n- Move left to (5,3)\n- Move left to (5,2)\n- Move up to (4,2)\n- Push the box down to (5,2)\n- Push the box down to (6,2)\n\nTherefore, the sequence of moves is:\nleft, up, up, left, down, down, right, right, right, down, down, left, left, left, left, up, down, down\n\nActually, I need to make a correction.

The box (B) in the second row is at the third column, so it's at position (1, 2). If I move it right 4 times, it ends at (1, 6), which is where the target (T) in the second row is located.

I need to move the boxes to the target areas.\n2. I need to be careful not to push boxes into corners or situations where they can't be moved anymore.\n3. I need to think ahead and plan my moves carefully.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the positions of the boxes and targets. There are 3 boxes and 3 targets, so each box needs to go to a specific target. Let me think about which box should go to which target.\n\nLet's try to solve this step by step:\n\n1. First, let me try to push the box at (4, 4) to the target at (3, 4) which is just above it.\n2. Then, let's see if we can push the box at (3, 3) to the target at (5, 2).\n3. Finally, we'll try to push the box at (5, 3) to the target at (1, 5).\n\nLet me plan out the moves:\n\nTo push the box at (4, 4) to the target at (3, 4), I need to get above the box, so I need to move to (5, 4).\n\nStarting position:\nPlayer: (6, 4)\nBox: (4, 4)\nTarget: (3, 4)\n\nMoves:\n1. Move up: (6, 4) -> (5, 4)\n2. Move up: (5, 4) -> (4, 4) (This pushes the box at (4, 4) to (3, 4))\n\nWait, there seems to be a problem. If I move up from (5, 4), I would push the box at (4, 4) to (3, 4), but there's already a box at (3, 3), which might be in the way. Let me reconsider.\n\nLet me check the layout again:\n\n```\nXXXXXXXX  (row 0)\nXEEEXTEX  (row 1)\nXEEXXEEX  (row 2)\nXEEBTEEX  (row 3)\nXEEEBEEX  (row 4)\nXETBEXXX  (row 5)\nXEEEIEEX  (row 6)\nXXXXXXXX  (row 7)\n```\n\nActually, the box at (3, 3) and the target at (3, 4) are adjacent. So if I push the box at (3, 3) to the right, it will go to the target at (3, 4). Similarly, the box at (5, 3) and the target at (5, 2) are adjacent.\n\nLet me reconsider my strategy:\n\n1. Push the box at (3, 3) to the target at (3, 4).\n2. Push the box at (5, 3) to the target at (5, 2).\n3. Push the box at (4, 4) to the target at (1, 5).\n\nActually, we should note that pushing the box at (4, 4) to (1, 5) would be tricky, as we need to navigate it through corridors. Let's see:\n\nStarting position:\nPlayer: (6, 4)\nBoxes: (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 3)\nTargets: (1, 5), (3, 4), (5, 2)\n\nNow, let me plan my moves.\n\nFirst, let me push the box at (3, 3) to the target at (3, 4):\n1. From (6, 4), I need to move around the box at (4, 4) to get to (3, 2), which is to the left of the box at (3, 3). I can go: \n   - left to (6, 3)\n   - left to (6, 2)\n   - up to (5, 2)\n   - up to (4, 2)\n   - up to (3, 2)\n2. Then I can push the box right: (3, 2) -> (3, 3) -> (3, 4)\n\nNext, let me push the box at (5, 3) to the target at (5, 2):\n1. From (3, 3), I need to move to (5, 4), which is to the right of the box at (5, 3). I can go:\n   - down to (4, 3)\n   - down to (5, 3) (this would push the box to (5, 2), which is a target)\n\nLastly, let me push the box at (4, 4) to the target at (1, 5):\n1. From (5, 3), I need to navigate around to push the box upwards. I can go:\n   - right to (5, 4)\n   - up to (4, 4) (this would push the box to (3, 4), but there's already a box there, so I need to reconsider)\n\nHold on, I need to reconsider. The box at (4, 4) cannot be pushed upward because there's a box at (3, 4) (after I pushed it there). I need to think of another approach.\n\nActually, I think I'm working with the wrong locations. Let me re-assess the grid with (0,0) as the top-left corner.\n\n```\n01234567  (column)\nXXXXXXXX  (row 0)\nXEEEXTEX  (row 1)\nXEEXXEEX  (row 2)\nXEEBTEEX  (row 3)\nXEEEBEEX  (row 4)\nXETBEXXX  (row 5)\nXEEEIEEX  (row 6)\nXXXXXXXX  (row 7)\n```\n\nPlayer is at (6, 4) (row 6, column 4).\nBoxes are at:\n- (3, 3) (row 3, column 3)\n- (4, 4) (row 4, column 4)\n- (5, 3) (row 5, column 3)\n\nTarget areas are at:\n- (1, 5) (row 1, column 5)\n- (3, 4) (row 3, column 4)\n- (5, 2) (row 5, column 2)\n\nNow let's think again. I want to push the box at (3, 3) to the target at (3, 4), the box at (5, 3) to the target at (5, 2), and the box at (4, 4) to the target at (1, 5).\n\nLet me plan my moves.\n\nFrom (6, 4), I'll go:\n1. Left to (6, 3) - 'left'\n2. Left to (6, 2) - 'left'\n3. Up to (5, 2) - 'up' - now I'm at the target area at (5, 2)\n4. Right to (5, 3) - 'right' - this would push the box at (5, 3) to (5, 4), which is not a target area.\n\nActually, I made another mistake. The box at (5, 3) should be pushed to the left to reach the target at (5, 2). To do this, I need to be at (5, 4). Let me rethink.\n\nFrom (6, 4), I'll go:\n1. Up to (5, 4) - 'up'\n2. Left to (5, 3) - 'left' - This pushes the box at (5, 3) to the target at (5, 2).\n\nNow, I need to push the box at (3, 3) to the target at (3, 4). From (5, 2), I'll go:\n1. Up to (4, 2) - 'up'\n2. Up to (3, 2) - 'up'\n3. Right to (3, 3) - 'right' - This pushes the box at (3, 3) to the target at (3, 4).\n\nFinally, I need to push the box at (4, 4) to the target at (1, 5). From (3, 4), I'll go:\n1. Down to (4, 4) - 'down' - This pushes the box at (4, 4) to (5, 4).\n2. Down to (6, 4) - 'down'\n3. Right to (6, 5) - 'right'\n4. Right to (6, 6) - 'right'\n5. Up to (5, 6) - 'up'\n6. Up to (4, 6) - 'up'\n7. Up to (3, 6) - 'up'\n8. Up to (2, 6) - 'up'\n9. Up to (1, 6) - 'up'\n10. Left to (1, 5) - 'left' - This is a target area.\n11. Down to (2, 5) - 'down'\n12. Down to (3, 5) - 'down'\n13. Down to (4, 5) - 'down'\n14. Left to (4, 4) - 'left' - We're now to the right of the box at (5, 4).\n15. Left to (4, 3) - 'left'\n16. Down to (5, 3) - 'down'\n17. Right to (5, 4) - 'right' - We're now below the box at (5, 4).\n18. Right to (5, 5) - 'right'\n19. Right to (5, 6) - 'right'\n20. Up to (4, 6) - 'up'\n21. Left to (4, 5) - 'left' - We're now to the right of the box at (4, 4).\n22. Up to (3, 5) - 'up'\n23. Left to (3, 4) - 'left' - This is where I pushed the first box, and it's blocking my path.\n\nActually, it looks like I've misunderstood the puzzle. Let me take a fresh look.\n\n```\n01234567  (column)\nXXXXXXXX  (row 0)\nXEEEXTEX  (row 1)\nXEEXXEEX  (row 2)\nXEEBTEEX  (row 3)\nXEEEBEEX  (row 4)\nXETBEXXX  (row 5)\nXEEEIEEX  (row 6)\nXXXXXXXX  (row 7)\n```\n\nPlayer is at (6, 4) (row 6, column 4).\nBoxes are at:\n- (3, 3) (row 3, column 3)\n- (4, 4) (row 4, column 4)\n- (5, 3) (row 5, column 3)\n\nTarget areas are at:\n- (1, 5) (row 1, column 5)\n- (3, 4) (row 3, column 4)\n- (5, 2) (row 5, column 2)\n\nI made a crucial error above. In my solution, I've pushed a box to (3, 4), which would indeed block my path. Since I can't push two boxes at once, I need to be more careful about the order in which I push the boxes.\n\nLet me re-evaluate the order:\n\n1. Push the box at (5, 3) to the target at (5, 2). - This seems like a good first step.\n2. Push the box at (4, 4) to the target at (1, 5). - This seems like it would be easier to do before dealing with the box at (3, 3).\n3. Push the box at (3, 3) to the target at (3, 4). - This seems like it would be a good last step.\n\nStarting from (6, 4), I'll go:\n1. Up to (5, 4) - 'up'\n2. Left to (5, 3) - 'left' - This pushes the box at (5, 3) to the target at (5, 2).\n\nNow, I need to push the box at (4, 4) to the target at (1, 5). From (5, 2), I'll go:\n1. Up to (4, 2) - 'up'\n2. Right to (4, 3) - 'right'\n3. Right to (4, 4) - 'right' - This pushes the box at (4, 4) to (4, 5).\n4. Right to (4, 6) - 'right'\n5. Up to (3, 6) - 'up'\n6. Up to (2, 6) - 'up'\n7. Up to (1, 6) - 'up'\n8. Left to (1, 5) - 'left' - This is a target area.\n9. Down to (2, 5) - 'down'\n10. Down to (3, 5) - 'down'\n11. Down to (4, 5) - 'down' - We're now below the box at (4, 5).\n12. Up to (3, 5) - 'up' - This pushes the box at (4, 5) to (2, 5).\n\nWait, that doesn't work. If I push the box from (4, 5) upward, it would go to (3, 5), not (2, 5). Let me re-evaluate.\n\nFrom (4, 5), I'll go:\n1. Up to (3, 5) - 'up' - This pushes the box at (4, 5) to (2, 5).\n\nWait, that's incorrect. If I'm at (4, 5) and move up, I'd be at (3, 5), and if there's a box at (4, 5), it would be pushed to (3, 5). But there's no box at (4, 5) yet; I need to push the box at (4, 4) to (4, 5) first. Let me re-evaluate.\n\nWait, a bit later. If I push the box at (4, 4) to (4, 5), then from (4, 5), I can push the box upward to (3, 5), then to (2, 5), then to (1, 5), which is a target area. That's correct.\n\nActually, let me trace through this solution more carefully to ensure it works.\n\nStarting from (6, 4), I'll go:\n1. Up to (5, 4) - 'up'\n2. Left to (5, 3) - 'left' - This pushes the box at (5, 3) to the target at (5, 2).\n3. Up to (4, 3) - 'up'\n4. Right to (4, 4) - 'right' - This pushes the box at (4, 4) to (4, 5).\n5. Up to (3, 4) - 'up'\n6. Right to (3, 5) - 'right'\n7. Up to (2, 5) - 'up'\n8. Up to (1, 5) - 'up' - This is a target area.\n9. Right to (1, 6) - 'right'\n10. Down to (2, 6) - 'down'\n11. Down to (3, 6) - 'down'\n12. Left to (3, 5) - 'left'\n13. Down to (4, 5) - 'down' - We're now below the box at (3, 5).\n14. Up to (3, 5) - 'up' - This pushes the box at (3, 5) to (2, 5).\n15. Up to (2, 5) - 'up' - This pushes the box at (2, 5) to (1, 5), which is a target area.\n\nWait, I think I'm confusing myself. Let me take a different approach and build a mental image of the grid, tracking the positions of the player and boxes as I go.\n\nInitial state:\n```\n01234567  (column)\nXXXXXXXX  (row 0)\nXEEEXTEX  (row 1)\nXEEXXEEX  (row 2)\nXEEBTEEX  (row 3)\nXEEEBEEX  (row 4)\nXETBEXXX  (row 5)\nXEEEIEEX  (row 6)\nXXXXXXXX  (row 7)\n```\n\nPlayer at (6, 4).\nBoxes at (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 3).\nTargets at (1, 5), (3, 4), (5, 2).\n\n1.

Let me check the board again.\n\n```\n01234567  (column)\nXXXXXXXX  (row 0)\nXEEEXTEX  (row 1)\nXEEXXEEX  (row 2)\nXEEBTEEX  (row 3)\nXEEEBEEX  (row 4)\nXETBEXXX  (row 5)\nXEEEIEEX  (row 6)\nXXXXXXXX  (row 7)\n```\n\nActually, I noticed that at row 2, column 4 and 5, there are two 'X's, which means there are walls there. So my plan to push the box at (4, 4) upward might not work. Let me rethink.\n\nActually. I think what happened is that from (4, 4), I can't move up to (3, 4) because there's a box at (3, 3) and walls nearby, so my path is blocked. But I should be able to move right to (4, 5) (pushing the box to (4, 5) in the process), and then right again to (4, 6). Let's continue:\n\n1. Move up - 'up'\n   Player at (5, 4).\n\n2. Move left - 'left'\n   Player at (5, 3).\n   Box at (5, 3) is pushed to (5, 2).\n   Boxes now at (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 2).\n   One box is at a target!\n\n3. Move up - 'up'\n   Player at (4, 3).\n\n4. Move right - 'right'\n   Player at (4, 4).\n   Box at (4, 4) is pushed to (4, 5).\n   Boxes now at (3, 3), (4, 5), (5, 2).\n\n5. Move right - 'right'\n   Player at (4, 6).\n\n6. Move up - 'up'\n   Player at (3, 6).\n\n7. Move up - 'up'\n   Player at (2, 6).\n\n8. Move up - 'up'\n   Player at (1, 6).\n\n9. Move left - 'left'\n   Player at (1, 5).\n   Player is at a target.\n\n10. Move down - 'down'\n    Player at (2, 5).\n    \n11. Move down - 'down'\n    Player at (3, 5).\n    \n12. Move down - 'down'\n    Player at (4, 5).\n    Box at (4, 5) is present.\n    \n13. Move up - 'up'\n    Player at (3, 5).\n    Box at (4, 5) is pushed to (3, 5).\n    Boxes now at (3, 3), (3, 5), (5, 2).\n    \nWait, I'm confused again. If I move up from (4, 5), I'd be at (3, 5) and the box would be pushed to (2, 5). Let's get the board orientation right (with (0, N) as the top-right corner):\n\n```\n01234567  (column)\nXXXXXXXX  (row 0)\nXEEEXTEX  (row 1)\nXEEXXEEX  (row 2)\nXEEBTEEX  (row 3)\nXEEEBEEX  (row 4)\nXETBEXXX  (row 5)\nXEEEIEEX  (row 6)\nXXXXXXXX  (row 7)\n```\n\nIf I'm at (4, 5) and move \"up\", I move to a lower row number, which would be (3, 5). If there's a box at (4, 5), it would be pushed to (3, 5). Let's try again:\n\n13. Move up - 'up'\n    Player at (3, 5).\n    Box at (4, 5) is pushed to (3, 5).\n    Boxes now at (3, 3), (3, 5), (5, 2).\n    \n14. Move up - 'up'\n    Player at (2, 5).\n    Box at (3, 5) is pushed to (2, 5).\n    Boxes now at (3, 3), (2, 5), (5, 2).\n    \n15. Move up - 'up'\n    Player at (1, 5).\n    Box at (2, 5) is pushed to (1, 5).\n    Boxes now at (3, 3), (1, 5), (5, 2).\n    Two boxes are at targets!\n    \nNow we need to push the box at (3, 3) to the target at (3, 4).\n\n16. Move right - 'right'\n    Player at (1, 6).\n    \n17. Move down - 'down'\n    Player at (2, 6).\n    \n18. Move down - 'down'\n    Player at (3, 6).\n    \n19. Move down - 'down'\n    Player at (4, 6).\n    \n20. Move left - 'left'\n    Player at (4, 5).\n    \n21. Move left - 'left'\n    Player at (4, 4).\n    \n22. Move left - 'left'\n    Player at (4, 3).\n    \n23. Move left - 'left'\n    Player at (4, 2).\n    \n24. Move up - 'up'\n    Player at (3, 2).\n    \n25. Move right - 'right'\n    Player at (3, 3).\n    Box at (3, 3) is pushed to (3, 4).\n    Boxes now at (3, 4), (1, 5), (5, 2).\n    All three boxes are at targets!\n    \nNow all boxes are at targets, so the puzzle is solved.\n\nThe solution is:\n```\n['up', 'left', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'up', 'up', 'up', 'left', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'up', 'up', 'up', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'up', 'right']\n```\n\nLet me verify one more time:\n\n1. Move up: Player at (5, 4).\n2. Move left: Player at (5, 3), box at (5, 2).\n3. Move up: Player at (4, 3).\n4. Move right: Player at (4, 4), box at (4, 5).\n5. Move right: Player at (4, 5), box at (4, 6).\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. At (4, 6), there should be a wall, not a box. Let me re-evaluate.\n\nLet me look at columns 5 and 6 at row 4 again. I think there might be a wall at (4, 6) that would prevent the box from being pushed there.\n\n```\n01234567  (column)\nXXXXXXXX  (row 0)\nXEEEXTEX  (row 1)\nXEEXXEEX  (row 2)\nXEEBTEEX  (row 3)\nXEEEBEEX  (row 4)\nXETBEXXX  (row 5)\nXEEEIEEX  (row 6)\nXXXXXXXX  (row 7)\n```\n\nAt row 4, columns 5 and 6, there are \"E\"s, which I'm assuming are empty spaces. So there shouldn't be a wall at (4, 6). Let me continue then.\n\nStarting from (6, 4), I'll go:\n1. Up to (5, 4) - 'up'\n2. Left to (5, 3) - 'left' - This pushes the box at (5, 3) to the target at (5, 2).\n   Boxes now at (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 2).\n3. Up to (4, 3) - 'up'\n4. Right to (4, 4) - 'right' - This pushes the box at (4, 4) to (4, 5).\n   Boxes now at (3, 3), (4, 5), (5, 2).\n5. Right to (4, 6) - 'right'\n   Player at (4, 6).\n\nPositions at end of 5:\n```\n01234567  (column)\nXXXXXXXX  (row 0)\nXEEEXTEX  (row 1)\nXEEXXEEX  (row 2)\nXEEBTEEX  (row 3) - Box at (3, 3)\nXEEEB*EX  (row 4) - Box at (4, 5), Player at (4, 6)\nXETBEXXX  (row 5) - Box at (5, 2)\nXEEEIEEX  (row 6)\nXXXXXXXX  (row 7)\n```\n\n6. Move up - 'up'\n   Player at (3, 6).\n\n7. Move up - 'up'\n   Player at (2, 6).\n\n8. Move up - 'up'\n   Player at (1, 6).\n\n9. Move left - 'left'\n   Player at (1, 5).\n   Player is at a target.\n\nAh, wait. I need to get to the box at (4, 5) and push it to (1, 5). From (1, 5), I need to get back to (4, 5).\n\n10. Move down - 'down'\n    Player at (2, 5).\n    \n11. Move down - 'down'\n    Player at (3, 5).\n    \n12. Move down - 'down'\n    Player at (4, 5).\n    Box at (4, 5) is present.\n    \n13. Move up - 'up'\n    Player at (3, 5).\n    Box at (4, 5) is pushed to (3, 5).\n    Boxes now at (3, 3), (3, 5), (5, 2).\n    \nWait, I made another mistake. If player is at (4, 5) and moves up, the player will be at (3, 5), and the box will move from (4, 5) to (3, 5). But from (3, 5), there's a box at (3, 3). I think these are too close, and I can't push them without pushing each other. Let me rethink.\n\nLooking at the coordinates again:\n\n```\n01234567  (column)\nXXXXXXXX  (row 0)\nXEEEXTEX  (row 1)\nXEEXXEEX  (row 2)\nXEEBTEEX  (row 3) - Box at (3, 3)\nXEEEB*EX  (row 4) - Box at (4, 5), Player at (4, 6)\nXETBEXXX  (row 5) - Box at (5, 2)\nXEEEIEEX  (row 6)\nXXXXXXXX  (row 7)\n```\n\nBox at (3, 3) and box at (4, 5) are in different columns, so they shouldn't interfere with each other. I should be able to push the box from (4, 5) up to (1, 5) and then deal with the box at (3, 3).\n\nContinuing from where I left off:\n\n13. Move up - 'up'\n    Player at (3, 5).\n    Box at (4, 5) is pushed to (3, 5).\n    Boxes now at (3, 3), (3, 5), (5, 2).\n\nWait a second. If I push the box from (4, 5) to (3, 5), it would be at the same row as the box at (3, 3). But they're in different columns, so this should be fine.\n\n13. Move up - 'up'\n    Player at (3, 5).\n    Box at (4, 5) is pushed to (3, 5).\n    Boxes now at (3, 3), (3, 5), (5, 2).\n    \n14. Move up - 'up'\n    Player at (2, 5).\n    Box at (3, 5) is pushed to (2, 5).\n    Boxes now at (3, 3), (2, 5), (5, 2).\n    \n15. Move up - 'up'\n    Player at (1, 5).\n    Box at (2, 5) is pushed to (1, 5).\n    Boxes now at (3, 3), (1, 5), (5, 2).\n    Two boxes are at targets!\n    \nNow we need to push the box at (3, 3) to the target at (3, 4).\n\n16. Move right - 'right'\n    Player at (1, 6).\n    \n17. Move down - 'down'\n    Player at (2, 6).\n    \n18. Move down - 'down'\n    Player at (3, 6).\n    \n19. Move down - 'down'\n    Player at (4, 6).\n    \n20. Move left - 'left'\n    Player at (4, 5).\n    \n21. Move left - 'left'\n    Player at (4, 4).\n    \n22. Move left - 'left'\n    Player at (4, 3).\n    \n23. Move left - 'left'\n    Player at (4, 2).\n    \n24. Move up - 'up'\n    Player at (3, 2).\n    \n25. Move right - 'right'\n    Player at (3, 3).\n    Box at (3, 3) is pushed to (3, 4).\n    Boxes now at (3, 4), (1, 5), (5, 2).\n    All three boxes are at targets!\n    \nNow all boxes are at targets, so the puzzle is solved.\n\nThe solution is:\n```\n['up', 'left', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'up', 'up', 'up', 'left', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'up', 'up', 'up', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'up', 'right']\n```\n\nI kept making an error in my step 5. From (4, 4), if I move right, I'd be at (4, 5), and the box at (4, 4) would be pushed to (4, 5). From (4, 5), if I move right again, I'd be at (4, 6). There doesn't seem to be a wall at (4, 6), so this should be fine. Let me recheck the board once more:\n\n```\n01234567  (column)\nXXXXXXXX  (row 0)\nXEEEXTEX  (row 1)\nXEEXXEEX  (row 2)\nXEEBTEEX  (row 3)\nXEEEBEEX  (row 4)\nXETBEXXX  (row 5)\nXEEEIEEX  (row 6)\nXXXXXXXX  (row 7)\n```\n\nAt position (4, 6), I see an 'E', which I'm assuming is an empty space. So my plan should work.\n\nLet me re-verify one last time just to be safe:\n\n1. Move up - 'up'\n   Player at (5, 4).\n   \n2. Move left - 'left'\n   Player at (5, 3).\n   Box at (5, 3) is pushed to (5, 2).\n   Boxes now at (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 2).\n   One box is at a target!\n\n3.

Move down - 'down'\n    Player at (4, 5).\n    Box at (4, 5) is present.\n    \n13. Move up - 'up'\n    Player at (3, 5).\n    Box at (4, 5) is pushed to (3, 5).\n    Boxes now at (3, 3), (3, 5), (5, 2).\n    \n14. Move up - 'up'\n    Player at (2, 5).\n    Box at (3, 5) is pushed to (2, 5).\n    Boxes now at (3, 3), (2, 5), (5, 2).\n    \n15. Move up - 'up'\n    Player at (1, 5).\n    Box at (2, 5) is pushed to (1, 5).\n    Boxes now at (3, 3), (1, 5), (5, 2).\n    Two boxes are at targets!\n\n16. Move right - 'right'\n    Player at (1, 6).\n    \n17. Move down - 'down'\n    Player at (2, 6).\n    \n18. Move down - 'down'\n    Player at (3, 6).\n    \n19. Move down - 'down'\n    Player at (4, 6).\n    \n20. Move left - 'left'\n    Player at (4, 5).\n    \n21. Move left - 'left'\n    Player at (4, 4).\n    \n22.

The goal is to push all boxes (B) onto the target areas (T).\n\nFirst, let me understand the layout of the board:\n\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXXXEETXX\nXEEBTEEX\nXEEBEEXX\nXEEEXXXX\nXEIEEEEX\nXEEXEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nWait, the symbols don't match the description. In the description, the symbols should be:\n- 'I' for player\n- 'B' for boxes\n- 'T' for target areas\n- 'X' for walls\n\nBut in the game board, I also see 'E' which wasn't mentioned. Let me assume 'E' represents empty spaces.\n\nLet me reinterpret the board with that assumption:\n\n```\nXXXXXXXX  (Row 0)\nXXXEETXX  (Row 1)\nXEEBTEEX  (Row 2)\nXEEBEEXX  (Row 3)\nXEEEXXXX  (Row 4)\nXEIEEEEX  (Row 5)\nXEEXEEEX  (Row 6)\nXXXXXXXX  (Row 7)\n```\n\nPlayer position (I): (5, 2) (row 5, column 2)\nBoxes (B):\n- Box 1: (2, 3) (row 2, column 3)\n- Box 2: (3, 3) (row 3, column 3)\nTarget areas (T):\n- Target 1: (1, 4) (row 1, column 4)\n- Target 2: (2, 4) (row 2, column 4)\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence of moves that will push both boxes onto the target areas.\n\nI'll start with the current state and work towards the goal:\n\n1. Player is at (5, 2)\n2. The boxes are at (2, 3) and (3, 3)\n3. The target areas are at (1, 4) and (2, 4)\n\nFirst, I need to get to a position where I can push the boxes. Let me trace a path to a position where I can start pushing the boxes upwards.\n\nThe closest position to start pushing would be at (4, 3), which is just below the lower box. From there, I can push it up.\n\nTo get to (4, 3) from (5, 2), I need to move:\n- Up (now at (4, 2))\n- Right (now at (4, 3))\n\nNow I'm in position to push the lower box up. If I move up again, I'll push the box from (3, 3) to (2, 3).\n\nBut wait, there's already a box at (2, 3). I can't push two boxes at once according to the rules.\n\nActually, let me double check the positions. The first box is at (2, 3) (row 2, column 3), and the second box is at (3, 3) (row 3, column 3). Yeah, they're stacked vertically, so I can't push the lower box upwards.\n\nLet's think of a different approach. I'll try to get to a position where I can push the top box (at (2, 3)) to the right, to get it onto the target at (2, 4). Then I'll push the bottom box up to eventually get it to the other target.\n\nI need to get to (2, 2) to push the top box to the right. To get there from (5, 2):\n- Up (now at (4, 2))\n- Up (now at (3, 2))\n- Up (now at (2, 2))\n\nNow I can push the top box to the right:\n- Right (pushes the box from (2, 3) to (2, 4))\n\nGreat! One box is on a target. Now I need to get to a position where I can push the lower box up. I need to get to (4, 3) for that.\n\nFrom (2, 3) (where I am now after pushing the first box):\n- Down (now at (3, 3))\n- Right (now at (3, 4))\n- Down (now at (4, 4))\n- Left (now at (4, 3))\n\nNow I can push the lower box up:\n- Up (pushes the box from (3, 3) to (2, 3))\n\nBut I've pushed the box to (2, 3), not to a target area. I need to push it further to get it to (1, 4). But I'd need to get to (2, 2) again, and push it to the right, and then up. Let me continue.\n\nFrom (3, 3) (where I am now after pushing the second box):\n- Down (now at (4, 3))\n- Right (now at (4, 4))\n- Up (now at (3, 4))\n- Up (now at (2, 4))\n- Left (now at (2, 3))\n- Right (now at (2, 4))\n\nWait, I can't move the player to (2, 4) because there's already a box there. Actually, I've boxed myself in and might not be able to solve the puzzle as currently stated.\n\nWait, I need to check my interpretation of the board. Maybe I missed something. Wait, I just realized I'm overthinking this. The board already shows where boxes (B) and targets (T) are, so 'E' might be used for both empty spaces and for target places that currently have no boxes on them.\n\nLet me reinterpret the board again to make sure:\n\n```\nXXXXXXXX  (Row 0)\nXXXEETXX  (Row 1)\nXEEBTEEX  (Row 2)\nXEEBEEXX  (Row 3)\nXEEEXXXX  (Row 4)\nXEIEEEEX  (Row 5)\nXEEXEEEX  (Row 6)\nXXXXXXXX  (Row 7)\n```\n\n- Player (I): (5, 2) (row 5, column 2)\n- Boxes (B): (2, 3) (row 2, column 3), (3, 3) (row 3, column 3)\n- Targets (T): (1, 4) (row 1, column 4), (2, 4) (row 2, column 4)\n- Walls (X): Surrounding the board and some internal walls\n- Empty spaces (E): Everything else\n\nNow let me trace the solution again:\n\n1. Player starts at (5, 2)\n2. I need to get to (2, 2) to push the top box to the right\n3. From (5, 2) to (2, 2): Up, Up, Up\n4. Push the top box to the right: Right (this gets the box onto a target at (2, 4))\n5. Now I need to get to (4, 3) to push the lower box up\n6. From (2, 3) to (4, 3): Down, Right, Down, Left\n7. Push the lower box up: Up\n8. Now the lower box is at (3, 3), but I need to get it to (1, 4)\n9. I need to get to (3, 2) to push it to the right: Left, Up, Right (now at (3, 2))\n10. Push the box to the right: Right (now the box is at (3, 4) and I'm at (3, 3))\n11. I need to get above the box to push it up: Right, Up, Left (now at (2, 4))\n\nBut there's already a box at (2, 4). I'm stuck again.\n\nLet me reconsider the puzzle and make sure that the targets are indeed where I think they are. Looking at the board again:\n\n```\nXXXXXXXX  (Row 0)\nXXXEETXX  (Row 1)\nXEEBTEEX  (Row 2)\nXEEBEEXX  (Row 3)\nXEEEXXXX  (Row 4)\nXEIEEEEX  (Row 5)\nXEEXEEEX  (Row 6)\nXXXXXXXX  (Row 7)\n```\n\nThe targets (T) are at:\n- Target 1: (1, 4) (row 1, column 4)\n- Target 2: (2, 4) (row 2, column 4)\n\nOk, the targets are where I thought they were. \n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe I should try to get the lower box to the target at (1, 4) first, and then the upper box to the target at (2, 4).\n\n1. Player starts at (5, 2)\n2. I need to get to (3, 2) to push the lower box to the right\n3. From (5, 2) to (3, 2): Up, Up (now at (3, 2))\n4. Push the lower box to the right: Right (now the box is at (3, 4) and I'm at (3, 3))\n5. I need to get above the box to push it up: Right, Up, Left (now at (2, 4))\n6. Push the box up: Up (now the box is at (1, 4) and I'm at (2, 4))\n\nGreat! The lower box is now at one of the targets. Now I need to get the upper box to the other target.\n\n7. I need to get to (2, 2) to push the upper box to the right\n8. From (2, 4) to (2, 2): Left, Left (now at (2, 2))\n9. Push the upper box to the right: Right (now the box is at (2, 4) and I'm at (2, 3))\n\nBoth boxes are now on target areas! \n\nLet me double-check this solution to make sure it's valid:\n\n1. Player starts at (5, 2)\n2. Up, Up (now at (3, 2))\n3. Right (pushes the lower box to (3, 4), player at (3, 3))\n4. Right (now at (3, 4))\n5. Up (now at (2, 4))\n6. Left (now at (2, 3))\n7. Up (pushes the upper box to (1, 3), player at (2, 3))\n\nWait, I made a mistake above. The upper box is initially at (2, 3), not at (2, 2). So when I'm at (3, 2) and go up, I'll be at (2, 2), which is to the left of the upper box. So I need to go right to push it.\n\nLet me rethink the solution:\n\n1. Player starts at (5, 2)\n2. I need to get to (4, 3) to push the lower box up\n3. From (5, 2) to (4, 3): Up, Right (now at (4, 3))\n4. Push the lower box up: Up (now the box is at (2, 3) and I'm at (3, 3))\n\nBut there's already a box at (2, 3). I made a mistake again. The lower box is at (3, 3), not (3, 2).\n\nLet me redraw the board for clarity:\n\n```\nXXXXXXXX  (Row 0)\nXXXEETXX  (Row 1)\nXEEBTEEX  (Row 2)\nXEEBEEXX  (Row 3)\nXEEEXXXX  (Row 4)\nXEIEEEEX  (Row 5)\nXEEXEEEX  (Row 6)\nXXXXXXXX  (Row 7)\n```\n\nThe board needs to be labeled with coordinates to make it easier to track movements.\n\n```\n  01234567  (Column)\n0 XXXXXXXX\n1 XXXEETXX\n2 XEEBTEEX\n3 XEEBEEXX\n4 XEEEXXXX\n5 XEIEEEEX\n6 XEEXEEEX\n7 XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nWith coordinates, I can see:\n- Player (I): (5, 2) (row 5, column 2)\n- Box 1 (B): (2, 3) (row 2, column 3)\n- Box 2 (B): (3, 3) (row 3, column 3)\n- Target 1 (T): (1, 4) (row 1, column 4)\n- Target 2 (T): (2, 4) (row 2, column 4)\n\nNow, let me try to solve this again. I need to push Box 1 to Target 2 and Box 2 to Target 1.\n\nLet's start with Box 2 (the one at (3, 3)):\n\n1. Player starts at (5, 2)\n2. I need to get to (4, 3) to push Box 2 up\n3. From (5, 2) to (4, 3): Up, Right (now at (4, 3))\n4. Push Box 2 up: Up (now Box 2 is at (2, 3) and I'm at (3, 3))\n\nBut there's already a box (Box 1) at (2, 3). I made an error. Let me check the board again:\n\n```\n  01234567\n0 XXXXXXXX\n1 XXXEETXX\n2 XEEBTEEX\n3 XEEBEEXX\n4 XEEEXXXX\n5 XEIEEEEX\n6 XEEXEEEX\n7 XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nBox 1 is at (2, 3) and Box 2 is at (3, 3). You're right, they're stacked vertically. I can't push Box 2 up because Box 1 is in the way. \n\nLet me try a different approach. I'll try to get Box 1 onto a target first, and then work on Box 2.\n\n1. Player starts at (5, 2)\n2. I need to get to (2, 2) to push Box 1 to the right\n3. From (5, 2) to (2, 2): Up, Up, Up (now at (2, 2))\n4. Push Box 1 to the right: Right (now Box 1 is at (2, 4) and I'm at (2, 3))\n\nGreat! Box 1 is now at Target 2. Now I need to get Box 2 to Target 1.\n\n5. I need to get to (3, 2) to push Box 2 to the right\n6. From (2, 3) to (3, 2): Down, Left (now at (3, 2))\n7. Push Box 2 to the right: Right (now Box 2 is at (3, 4) and I'm at (3, 3))\n8. I need to get above Box 2 to push it up\n9. From (3, 3) to (2, 4): Right, Up, Left (now at (2, 4))\n\nBut there's already a box (Box 1) at (2, 4). I can't be there.\n\nLet me retry. I need a more carefully planned sequence:\n\n1. Player starts at (5, 2)\n2. I need to get to (3, 2) to push Box 2 to the right first\n3. From (5, 2) to (3, 2): Up, Up (now at (3, 2))\n4. Push Box 2 to the right: Right (now Box 2 is at (3, 4) and I'm at (3, 3))\n5. I need to get above Box 2 to push it up, but I need to avoid pushing Box 1 for now\n6. From (3, 3) to (2, 4): Right, Up, Left (now at (2, 4))\n7. Push Box 2 up: Up (now Box 2 is at (1, 4) and I'm at (2, 4))\n\nGreat! Box 2 is now at Target 1. Now I need to get Box 1 to Target 2.\n\n8. I need to get to (2, 2) to push Box 1 to the right\n9. From (2, 4) to (2, 2): Left, Left (now at (2, 2))\n10. Push Box 1 to the right: Right, Right (now Box 1 is at (2, 4) and I'm at (2, 3))\n\nBoth boxes are now on target areas!\n\nLet's verify this solution once more:\n\n1. Player starts at (5, 2)\n2. Up, Up (now at (3, 2))\n3. Right (pushes Box 2 to (3, 4), player at (3, 3))\n4. Right (now at (3, 4))\n5. Up (now at (2, 4))\n6. Left (now at (2, 3))\n7. Up (now at (1, 3), to the left of Box 2)\n8. Right (pushes Box 2 to (1, 4), player at (1, 3))\n9. Down (now at (2, 3), to the left of Box 1)\n10. Left (now at (2, 2))\n11. Right (pushes Box 1 to (2, 3), player at (2, 2))\n12. Right (pushes Box 1 to (2, 4), player at (2, 3))\n\nWait, I made another error in the plan. Box 1 is at (2, 3), not (2, 4). After pushing Box 2 to (1, 4) and going down, I'll be at (2, 3) which is where Box 1 is, so I can't go there.\n\nLet me reformulate the solution:\n\n1. Player starts at (5, 2)\n2. Up, Up (now at (3, 2))\n3. Right (pushes Box 2 to (3, 4), player at (3, 3))\n4. Right (now at (3, 4))\n5. Up (now at (2, 4))\n6. Left (now at (2, 3), which is where Box 1 is)\n\nActually, I can't move to (2, 3) because Box 1 is there.\n\nLet's take a step back and reconsider. To push Box 2 from (3, 3) to (1, 4), I need to follow a different route:\n\n1. Player starts at (5, 2)\n2. I need to get to (3, 2) to push Box 2 to the right\n3. From (5, 2) to (3, 2): Up, Up (now at (3, 2))\n4. Push Box 2 to the right: Right (now Box 2 is at (3, 4) and I'm at (3, 3))\n5. I need to get to (2, 4) to push Box 2 up\n6. From (3, 3) to (2, 4): Right, Up, Left (now at (2, 4))\n\nBut in the current board state, going up from (3, 4) would mean I'm at (2, 4), but that's an empty space with 'E'. Can I just walk through it?\n\nActually, I see now that Target 2 (T) is at (2, 4), which means it's an empty target. We can walk through empty targets, so that's fine.\n\nLet me correct my solution once more:\n\n1. Player starts at (5, 2)\n2. Up, Up (now at (3, 2))\n3. Right (pushes Box 2 to (3, 4), player at (3, 3))\n4. Right (now at (3, 4))\n5. Up (now at (2, 4))\n6. Left (now at (2, 3), this is where Box 1 is)\n\nOh wait, I'm doing the same thing again. I think I keep making the error of thinking I can move into a space where a box is. Let me more carefully track my positions:\n\nPlayer starts at (5, 2).\n\n1. Up (now at (4, 2))\n2. Up (now at (3, 2))\n3. Right (pushes Box 2 from (3, 3) to (3, 4), player at (3, 3))\n4. I need to get to (2, 3) to push Box 1 to the right\n5. From (3, 3) to (2, 3), I need to go: Up (now I'm at (2, 3), which pushes Box 1 to (1, 3) and player is at (2, 3))\n6. Right (now I'm at (2, 4), which is Target 2)\n7. Up (now I'm at (1, 4), which is Target 1)\n8. Left (now I'm at (1, 3), which is where Box 1 is)\n9. Right (pushes Box 1 to (1, 4), which is Target 1)\n\nSo now Box 1 is at Target 1, but Box 2 is still at (3, 4), not on a target. I'll need to get it to Target 2 now.\n\n10. Down (now I'm at (2, 4), which is Target 2)\n11. Down (now I'm at (3, 4), which is where Box 2 is)\n12. Up (pushes Box 2 to (2, 4), which is Target 2)\n\nPerfect! Now both boxes are on targets:\n- Box 1 is at Target 1 (1, 4)\n- Box 2 is at Target 2 (2, 4)\n\nLet me verify this solution once more by tracking my moves:\n\n```\n  01234567\n0 XXXXXXXX\n1 XXXEETXX\n2 XEEBTEEX\n3 XEEBEEXX\n4 XEEEXXXX\n5 XEIEEEEX\n6 XEEXEEEX\n7 XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nPlayer starts at (5, 2).\n\n1.

Let me check one more time:\n\n- Box 1 is pushed from (2, 3) to (1, 3), then to (1, 4)\n- Box 2 is pushed from (3, 3) to (3, 4), then to (2, 4)\n\nI think this solution is correct:\n- 'up'\n- 'up'\n- 'right'\n- 'up'\n- 'right'\n- 'up'\n- 'left'\n- 'right'\n- 'down'\n- 'down'\n- 'right'\n- 'up'\n\nLet me summarize the solution in the required format:\n['up', 'up', 'right', 'up', 'right', 'up', 'left', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'up']# Sokoban Puzzle Solution\n\nLooking at the game board:\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXXXEETXX\nXEEBTEEX\nXEEBEEXX\nXEEEXXXX\nXEIEEEEX\nXEEXEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nI need to push the two boxes (B) to the two target areas (T).\n\n## Initial Analysis\n- Player (I) is at position (5,2)\n- Boxes (B) are at positions (2,3) and (3,3) - stacked vertically\n- Target areas (T) are at positions (1,4) and (2,4)\n- The walls (X) surround the playing area with some internal walls\n\n## Solution Strategy\nI'll first push the lower box to the right, then push the upper box up and right to get it onto the first target.

There are also two target areas ('T') at positions (1, 5) and (2, 6).\n\nThe objective is to push all boxes onto target areas, and I need to give a sequence of moves (up, down, left, right) to achieve this.\n\nLet's start solving:\n\nStarting point: Player is at (3, 1).\nBox 1 is at (3, 5).\nBox 2 is at (5, 5).\nTarget 1 is at (1, 5).\nTarget 2 is at (2, 6).\n\nLet me think about the solution:\n\n1. I need to push Box 1 (at (3, 5)) to one of the target areas. The closest target is Target 1 at (1, 5).\n2. I need to push Box 2 (at (5, 5)) to the other target area (Target 2 at (2, 6)).\n\nFirst, I'll try to get to Box 1 and push it up to Target 1:\n\nPlayer starts at (3, 1).\nMove right to (3, 2).\nMove right to (3, 3).\nMove right to (3, 4).\nNow the player is adjacent to Box 1. Push the box upward.\nMove right (to position (3, 5)).\nPush up (box moves to (2, 5)).\nPush up again (box moves to (1, 5), which is Target 1).\n\nNow, I need to get to Box 2 and push it to Target 2:\n\nCurrent player position is (2, 5).\nMove down to (3, 5).\nMove down to (4, 5).\nNow the player is adjacent to Box 2. \nMove down (to position (5, 5)).\nPush up (box moves to (4, 5)).\nPush right (box moves to (4, 6)).\nPush up (box moves to (3, 6)).\nPush up (box moves to (2, 6), which is Target 2).\n\nBut I need to double-check if there are any obstacles to these moves. Let's look at the game board more carefully:\n\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEXETEX\nXEXEEETX\nXIXEBEEX\nXEEEEEEX\nXEEEEBEX\nXEEEXEXX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nActually, I made an error in my target identifications. Let me reidentify:\n\nTarget 1 is at (1, 5).\nTarget 2 is at (2, 7).\n\nOh, I'm also having some trouble with the coordinates. Let me use a more intuitive approach, treating rows and columns as in a 2D array, with the first row and column both being index 0.\n\n```\n01234567  (column)\n0XXXXXXXX\n1XEEXETEX\n2XEXEEETX\n3XIXEBEEX\n4XEEEEEEX\n5XEEEEBEX\n6XEEEXEXX\n7XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nWith this, I can see:\n- The player ('I') is at position (3, 1). (That's row 3, column 1)\n- There are two boxes ('B') on the board, one at position (3, 5) and another at (5, 5).\n- There are also two target areas ('T') at positions (1, 5) and (2, 7).\n\nWait, row 2, column 7 is a wall ('X') according to the map. Let me check the target areas again:\n\n```\n01234567  (column)\n0XXXXXXXX\n1XEEXETEX\n2XEXEEETX\n3XIXEBEEX\n4XEEEEEEX\n5XEEEEBEX\n6XEEEXEXX\n7XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nI see the targets ('T') at:\n- Row 1, Column 5\n- Row 2, Column 7\n\nWait, row 2, column 7 is actually a wall ('X'). Let me look again:\n\n```\n01234567  (column)\n0XXXXXXXX\n1XEEXETEX\n2XEXEEETX\n3XIXEBEEX\n4XEEEEEEX\n5XEEEEBEX\n6XEEEXEXX\n7XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nThe targets ('T') are at:\n- Row 1, Column 5\n- Row 2, Column 6\n\nAnd the boxes ('B') are at:\n- Row 3, Column 5\n- Row 5, Column 5\n\nNow I understand the initial state better.\n\nLet's plan our solution:\n\n1. I need to push the box at (3, 5) to the target at (1, 5). This means I need to move the box up two spaces.\n2. I need to push the box at (5, 5) to the target at (2, 6). This means I need to move the box up three spaces and right one space.\n\nLet me work out the sequence of moves for this:\n\nStep 1: Move the box at (3, 5) to the target at (1, 5).\n- I start at (3, 1).\n- I need to get to the right side of the box to push it upwards.\n- I can move: right, right, right, right, then up. Now I'm at position (2, 5), to the left of the box.\n- I move right to be at (2, 6), then I push up and the box is at (1, 5) (a target).\n\nBut wait, there seems to be an issue with my understanding. Let me recheck the map:\n\n```\n01234567  (column)\n0XXXXXXXX\n1XEEXETEX\n2XEXEEETX\n3XIXEBEEX\n4XEEEEEEX\n5XEEEEBEX\n6XEEEXEXX\n7XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nOh, I was confusing myself. To be clear, the player ('I') is at position (row 3, column 1), which is the 4th row and 2nd column if we count from 1.\n\nThe boxes ('B') are at:\n- (row 3, column 5) - the 4th row and 6th column\n- (row 5, column 5) - the 6th row and 6th column\n\nThe targets ('T') are at:\n- (row 1, column 5) - the 2nd row and 6th column\n- (row 2, column 6) - the 3rd row and 7th column\n\nI need to push the boxes to the targets. Let me think step by step:\n\nStep 1: Move the box at (3, 5) to the target at (1, 5).\n- I start at (3, 1).\n- I need to get to the right side of the box to push it left, or below the box to push it up.\n- The most efficient seems to be to push it up. So I need to get to position (4, 5) (below the box).\n- I can move: right, right, right, right, down. Now I'm at position (4, 5).\n- I move up and push the box up, so the box is at (2, 5).\n- I move up and push the box up again, and now the box is at (1, 5) (a target).\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. From my position at (3, 1), if I move right 4 times, I'd be at (3, 5). But that's where the box is. Let me recheck the map:\n\n```\n01234567  (column)\n0XXXXXXXX\n1XEEXETEX\n2XEXEEETX\n3XIXEBEEX\n4XEEEEEEX\n5XEEEEBEX\n6XEEEXEXX\n7XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nOk I was right initially. The box is indeed at (3, 5). So if I move right 4 times, I'll be at the position of the box, which I can't do.\n\nLet me correct my understanding one more time:\n\nThe player ('I') is at position (row 3, column 1).\nThe boxes ('B') are at:\n- (row 3, column 5)\n- (row 5, column 5)\n\nThe targets ('T') are at:\n- (row 1, column 5)\n- (row 2, column 6)\n\nStarting from my position (3, 1), I can't move right 4 times as that would place me at the box. I need to navigate around it. Let me plan my moves:\n\nStep 1: I start at (3, 1).\nStep 2: I move right to (3, 2).\nStep 3: I move right to (3, 3).\nStep 4: I move right to (3, 4).\nStep 5: I move down to (4, 4).\nStep 6: I move right to (4, 5).\nStep 7: I move up to (3, 5) and push the box up to (2, 5).\nStep 8: I move up to (2, 5) and push the box up to (1, 5) (a target).\n\nNow, let's move the second box:\n\nStep 9: From (1, 5), I move down to (2, 5).\nStep 10: I move down to (3, 5).\nStep 11: I move down to (4, 5).\nStep 12: I move down to (5, 5) and push the box up to (4, 5).\nStep 13: I move right to (4, 6).\nStep 14: I move up to (3, 6).\nStep 15: I move left to (3, 5) and push the box right to (3, 6).\nStep 16: I move right to (3, 6) and push the box up to (2, 6) (a target).\n\nLet me double-check this plan against the game board:\n\n```\n01234567  (column)\n0XXXXXXXX\n1XEEXETEX\n2XEXEEETX\n3XIXEBEEX\n4XEEEEEEX\n5XEEEEBEX\n6XEEEXEXX\n7XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nTo push the first box to the target at (1, 5), I need to get below it and push it up twice.\n\nBut if I try to do this:\n\nStep 1: I start at (3, 1).\nStep 2: I move right to (3, 2).\nStep 3: I move right to (3, 3).\nStep 4: I move right to (3, 4).\nStep 5: I move down to (4, 4).\nStep 6: I move right to (4, 5).\nStep 7: I move up to (3, 5) and push the box up to (2, 5).\nStep 8: I move up to (2, 5) and push the box up to (1, 5) (a target).\n\nI worry about step 7. Let me trace the board state. After step 6, I'm at (4, 5). The box is at (3, 5). When I move up, I'll push the box to (2, 5). But is there an empty space at (2, 5)?\n\nLet's check the initial state:\n\n```\n01234567  (column)\n0XXXXXXXX\n1XEEXETEX\n2XEXEEETX\n3XIXEBEEX\n4XEEEEEEX\n5XEEEEBEX\n6XEEEXEXX\n7XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nAt row 2, column 5 (i.e., position (2, 5)), there's a 'E', which I think means empty. That's good, so I can push the box there.\n\nNow, for step 8, after I push the box to (2, 5), I move up to (2, 5). I then push the box up to (1, 5), which is a target. The position (1, 5) has a 'T' on the board, which is perfect. Actually, let me double-check that:\n\n```\n01234567  (column)\n0XXXXXXXX\n1XEEXETEX\n2XEXEEETX\n3XIXEBEEX\n4XEEEEEEX\n5XEEEEBEX\n6XEEEXEXX\n7XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nYes, position (1, 5) has a 'T', so that's a target.\n\nNow, for the second box at (5, 5), I need to get it to the target at (2, 6).\n\nStep 9: From (1, 5), I move down to (2, 5).\nStep 10: I move down to (3, 5).\nStep 11: I move down to (4, 5).\nStep 12: I move down to (5, 5) and push the box up to (4, 5).\nStep 13: I move up to (4, 5) and push the box to (3, 5).\nStep 14: I move up to (3, 5) and push the box to (2, 5).\nStep 15: I move right to (2, 6).\nStep 16: I move left to (2, 5) and push the box right to (2, 6) (a target).\n\nBut wait, there's a problem. After step 14, the box is at (2, 5), and I'm at (3, 5). When I move right to (2, 6), I'd be at the same position as the target. Let me check the board again:\n\n```\n01234567  (column)\n0XXXXXXXX\n1XEEXETEX\n2XEXEEETX\n3XIXEBEEX\n4XEEEEEEX\n5XEEEEBEX\n6XEEEXEXX\n7XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nAt position (2, 6), there's a 'T'. So that's a target. But I can't push the box from position (2, 5) to (2, 6) directly, as I'd need to be at (2, 4) and push right. Let me revise my approach for the second box:\n\nStep 9: From (1, 5), I move down to (2, 5).\nStep 10: I move down to (3, 5).\nStep 11: I move down to (4, 5).\nStep 12: I move down to (5, 5) and push the box up to (4, 5).\nStep 13: I move right to (4, 6).\nStep 14: I move up to (3, 6).\nStep 15: I move left to (3, 5) and push the box right to (3, 6).\nStep 16: I move right to (3, 6) and push the box up to (2, 6) (a target).\n\nBut there's a problem in step 15. After step 14, I'm at (3, 6) and the box is at (4, 5). I can't move to (3, 5) as that would move me away from the box.\n\nLet me rethink the approach for the second box:\n\nStep 9: From (1, 5), I move down to (2, 5).\nStep 10: I move down to (3, 5).\nStep 11: I move down to (4, 5).\nStep 12: I move down to (5, 5) and push the box up to (4, 5).\nStep 13: I need to get the box from (4, 5) to (2, 6).\n\nI think a good approach is to push the box up to (2, 5), then push it right to (2, 6). Let's continue:\n\nStep 13: I move up to (4, 5) and push the box up to (3, 5).\nStep 14: I move up to (3, 5) and push the box up to (2, 5).\nStep 15: I move left to (2, 4).\nStep 16: I move right to (2, 5) and push the box right to (2, 6) (a target).\n\nOk, I hope this is now correct.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\n```\n01234567  (column)\n0XXXXXXXX\n1XEEXETEX\n2XEXEEETX\n3XIXEBEEX\n4XEEEEEEX\n5XEEEEBEX\n6XEEEXEXX\n7XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nFor step 15, I need to be at position (2, 4). Is that a valid position?\nLooking at the board, row 2, column 4 has an 'E', so it's an empty space. That's good.\n\nLet me summarize the solution:\n\nStarting with the first box:\n1. Right\n2. Right\n3. Right\n4. Right\n5. Down\n6. Right\n7. Up (pushing the box to (2, 5))\n8. Up (pushing the box to (1, 5), a target)\n\nNow for the second box:\n9. Down\n10. Down\n11. Down\n12. Down (pushing the box to (4, 5))\n13. Up (pushing the box to (3, 5))\n14. Up (pushing the box to (2, 5))\n15. Left\n16. Right (pushing the box to (2, 6), a target)\n\nLet me check this solution carefully:\n\nFirst for the moves 1-8 (the first box):\n1. I start at (3, 1) and move right to (3, 2).\n2. I move right to (3, 3).\n3. I move right to (3, 4).\n4. I move right to (3, 5). Wait, this is a problem! The box is already at (3, 5), so I can't move there directly. Let me reconsider the approach for the first box.\n\nHmm, I made an error. Let's rethink the plan for the first box:\n\nStarting at (3, 1):\n1. I move right to (3, 2).\n2. I move right to (3, 3).\n3. I move right to (3, 4).\n4. I move down to (4, 4).\n5. I move right to (4, 5).\n6. I move up to (3, 5) (pushing the box to (2, 5)).\n7. I move up to (2, 5) (pushing the box to (1, 5), a target).\n\nNow, for the second box:\n8. I move down to (3, 5).\n9. I move down to (4, 5).\n10. I move down to (5, 5) (pushing the box to (4, 5)).\n11. I move up to (4, 5) (pushing the box to (3, 5)).\n12. I move up to (3, 5) (pushing the box to (2, 5)).\n13. I move left to (2, 4).\n14. I move right to (2, 5) (pushing the box to (2, 6), a target).\n\nBut there's a mistake in step 4. If I'm at (3, 4) and move down, I'll be at (4, 4), not (3, 5). Actually I already account for that and noted the correct position, so the step after is correct.\n\nActually there's one step I'm missing. After step 10, I'm at (5, 5) and the box is on the same spot. I need a step to push the box:\n\n8. I move down to (3, 5).\n9. I move down to (4, 5).\n10. I move down to (5, 5).\n11. I move up, which pushes the box to (4, 5).\n12. I move up to (4, 5), which pushes the box to (3, 5).\n13. I move up to (3, 5), which pushes the box to (2, 5).\n14. I move left to (2, 4).\n15. I move right to (2, 5), which pushes the box to (2, 6), a target.\n\nLet me check my steps once more. I realized I was making a conceptual error by using the \"move\" action to both move the player and push a box.\n\nLet's be more precise:\n\nI start at (3, 1). The first box is at (3, 5) and needs to be pushed to (1, 5). The second box is at (5, 5) and needs to be pushed to (2, 6).\n\n1. I move right to (3, 2).\n2. I move right to (3, 3).\n3. I move right to (3, 4).\n\nAt this point, I'm adjacent to the first box. I need to get below it to push it up:\n4. I move down to (4, 4).\n5. I move right to (4, 5).\n6. I move up, pushing the box from (3, 5) to (2, 5).\n7. I move up, pushing the box from (2, 5) to (1, 5) (a target).\n\nNow, I need to move to the second box at (5, 5):\n8. I move down to (2, 5).\n9. I move down to (3, 5).\n10. I move down to (4, 5).\n11. I move down to (5, 5).\n\nOh, there's a problem. If I'm at (5, 5), the box is also at (5, 5). Let me go back and check the map:\n\n```\n01234567  (column)\n0XXXXXXXX\n1XEEXETEX\n2XEXEEETX\n3XIXEBEEX\n4XEEEEEEX\n5XEEEEBEX\n6XEEEXEXX\n7XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nYes, there's a box ('B') at (5, 5). But I can't occupy the same position as a box, so I think the box might actually be at (5, 4).\n\nWait, let me count more carefully:\n\n```\n01234567  (column)\n0XXXXXXXX\n1XEEXETEX\n2XEXEEETX\n3XIXEBEEX\n4XEEEEEEX\n5XEEEEBEX\n6XEEEXEXX\n7XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nOk, I can see:\n- A box ('B') at (3, 5) - row 3, column 5\n- A box ('B') at (5, 5) - row 5, column 5\n\nBoth boxes are in column 5, but in different rows.\n\nI've already planned how to get the first box to its target. Now, for the second box at (5, 5):\n\n8. I move down to (2, 5).\n9. I move down to (3, 5).\n10. I move down to (4, 5).\n11. I move down, pushing the box from (5, 5) to (6, 5).\n\nBut there's an issue: The box would go to (6, 5), but the target is at (2, 6). I need to push the box up, not down. So I need to be below the box, not above it. Let me rethink:\n\n8. I move down to (2, 5).\n9. I move down to (3, 5).\n10. I move down to (4, 5).\n11. I move right to (4, 6).\n12. I move down to (5, 6).\n13. I move left, pushing the box from (5, 5) to (5, 4).\n14. I move up to (4, 4).\n15. I move left to (4, 3).\n16. I move down to (5, 3).\n17. I move right, pushing the box from (5, 4) to (5, 5).\n18. I move up to (4, 5).\n19. I move up, pushing the box from (5, 5) to (4, 5).\n20. I move up, pushing the box from (4, 5) to (3, 5).\n21. I move up, pushing the box from (3, 5) to (2, 5).\n22. I move right, pushing the box from (2, 5) to (2, 6) (a target).\n\nBut there's still an issue. At step 22, I'd need to be at (2, 4) to push the box right. But after step 21, I'm at (3, 5). So steps 20-22 need adjusting:\n\n20. I move up, pushing the box from (4, 5) to (3, 5).\n21. I move left to (3, 4).\n22. I move up to (2, 4).\n23. I move right, pushing the box from (2, 5) to (2, 6) (a target).\n\nOk, let me double check these steps.\n\nActually, it seems like the solution I have is correct. Let's list out the sequence of moves:\n\n1. Right\n2. Right\n3. Right\n4. Down\n5. Right\n6. Up (pushing the first box up)\n7. Up (pushing the first box up to the target)\n8. Down\n9. Down\n10. Down\n11. Right\n12. Down\n13. Left (pushing the second box left)\n14. Up\n15. Left\n16. Down\n17. Right (pushing the second box right)\n18. Up\n19. Up (pushing the second box up)\n20. Up (pushing the second box up)\n21. Left\n22. Up\n23. Right (pushing the second box right to the target)\n\nLet me check if there are any issues with this sequence of moves:\n\nFrom (3, 1), I move right to (3, 2). That's fine.\nI move right again to (3, 3). That's fine.\nI move right again to (3, 4). That's fine.\nI move down to (4, 4). That's fine.\nI move right to (4, 5). That's fine.\nI move up, pushing the box from (3, 5) to (2, 5). That's fine.\nI move up, pushing the box from (2, 5) to (1, 5) (a target). That's fine.\nI move down to (2, 5). That's fine.\nI move down to (3, 5). That's fine.\nI move down to (4, 5). That's fine.\nI move right to (4, 6). That's fine.\nI move down to (5, 6). That's fine.\nI move left, pushing the box from (5, 5) to (5, 4). That's fine.\nI move up to (4, 4). That's fine.\nI move left to (4, 3). That's fine.\nI move down to (5, 3). That's fine.\nI move right, pushing the box from (5, 4) to (5, 5). That's fine.\nI move up to (4, 5). That's fine.\nI move up, pushing the box from (5, 5) to (4, 5). There's an issue here. After the previous step, I'm at (4, 5) and the box is at (5, 5). If I move up, I'd go to (3, 5) and push the box from (4, 5) to (3, 5). But there's no box at (4, 5) yet. This step is wrong.\n\nLet me correct this:\n\nI move up to (4, 5).\nI move down, pushing the box from (5, 5) to (4, 5). That's fine.\nI move up to (3, 5).\nI move up, pushing the box from (4, 5) to (3, 5). That's fine.\nI move up, pushing the box from (3, 5) to (2, 5). That's fine.\nI move left to (2, 4). That's fine.\nI move right, pushing the box from (2, 5) to (2, 6) (a target). That's fine.\n\nLet me check this updated sequence:\n\n1. Right\n2. Right\n3. Right\n4. Down\n5. Right\n6. Up (pushing the first box up)\n7. Up (pushing the first box up to the target)\n8. Down\n9. Down\n10. Down\n11. Right\n12. Down\n13. Left (pushing the second box left)\n14. Up\n15. Left\n16. Down\n17. Right (pushing the second box right)\n18. Up\n19. Down (pushing the second box up)\n20. Up\n21. Up (pushing the second box up)\n22. Up (pushing the second box up)\n23. Left\n24. Right (pushing the second box right to the target)\n\nHold on, there's an issue after I push the second box to (5, 5). I want to be below the box to push it up, but I'm at (4, 5). So I can't push the box up on the next move. I think the sequence is:\n\nI move up to (4, 5).\nI move right to (4, 6).\nI move down to (5, 6).\nI move left, pushing the box from (5, 5) to (5, 4).\n\nAt this point, I want to eventually push the box up the column. But I need to reposition myself. So:\n\nI move up to (4, 4).\nI move down to (5, 4) (pushing the box from (5, 4) to (5, 3)).\nI move left to (5, 2).\nI move down to (6, 2) (can't do: there's a wall).\n\nActually, the trick is to get to the bottom of the box. Let me think again.\n\nI'm at (4, 5).\nI move right to (4, 6).\nI move down to (5, 6).\nI move left, pushing the box from (5, 5) to (5, 4).\nI move left to (5, 3).\nI move up to (4, 3).\nI move right to (4, 4).\nI move down, pushing the box from (5, 4) to (6, 4).\n\nBut this seems wrong because the target is upwards, not downwards. Let me re-evaluate:\n\n1. Right\n2. Right\n3. Right\n4. Down\n5. Right\n6. Up (pushing the first box up)\n7. Up (pushing the first box up to the target)\n\nNow, I'm at (2, 5) and the second box is at (5, 5). I need to get below the box to push it up.\n\n8. Down\n9. Down\n10. Down\n11. Right (now I'm at (5, 6))\n12. Left (pushing the box from (5, 5) to (5, 4))\n\nNow I'm at (5, 5) and the box is at (5, 4). But the target is at (2, 6), which means I need to get the box up and to the right. I need to be careful here to avoid maneuvering the box into a corner or against a wall.\n\nHere's the approach:\n13. Up\n14. Left\n15. Down (pushing the box from (5, 4) to (6, 4))\n\nNow, I need to get to the right of the box to push it up the column:\n16. Down\n17. Right\n18. Up (pushing the box from (6, 4) to (5, 4))\n19. Up (pushing the box from (5, 4) to (4, 4))\n20. Up (pushing the box from (4, 4) to (3, 4))\n21. Up (pushing the box from (3, 4) to (2, 4))\n22. Right (pushing the box from (2, 4) to (2, 5))\n23. Right (pushing the box from (2, 5) to (2, 6) (a target))\n\nAh, but step 16 won't work. If I'm at (5, 4) and I try to move down to (6, 4), I'd be positioning myself in the same spot as a box, which doesn't work. Plus, the row index for the game board is 0-7, so (6, 4) would be outside the walls.\n\nLet me have one more look at the board to get my bearings straight:\n\n```\n01234567  (column)\n0XXXXXXXX\n1XEEXETEX\n2XEXEEETX\n3XIXEBEEX\n4XEEEEEEX\n5XEEEEBEX\n6XEEEXEXX\n7XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nSo, for the second box, I need to get it from (5, 5) to (2, 6).\n\nHere's my approach:\n1. Right\n2. Right\n3. Right\n4. Down\n5. Right\n6. Up (pushing the first box up)\n7. Up (pushing the first box up to the target)\n\nNow, I'm at (2, 5) and the second box is at (5, 5). I need to get to the left of the box to push it right, then above it to push it up, and so on until I get it to (2, 6).\n\n8. Down\n9. Down\n10. Down\n11. Right\n12. Down\n13. Left (pushing the box from (5, 5) to (5, 4))\n\nNow I need to get to the bottom of the box to push it up, but once it's up, I can push it right and then up again to get to the target.\n\n14. Up (to position (4, 4))\n15. Down (pushing the box from (5, 4) to (6, 4))\n\nBut this step would be outside the game board. Hmm, let's reconsider.\n\nOk, let's take a different approach:\n\n1. Right\n2. Right\n3. Right\n4. Down\n5. Right\n6. Up (pushing the first box up)\n7. Up (pushing the first box up to the target)\n\nNow, I'm at (2, 5) and the second box is at (5, 5). I need to get below the box to push it up.\n\n8. Down\n9. Down\n10. Down\n11. Right\n12. Down\n13. Left (pushing the box from (5, 5) to (5, 4))\n\nNow I'm at (5, 5) and the box is at (5, 4). I need to get to the right of the box to push it to the left, and then eventually, I'll want to get above it to push it down, so I can get to the other side and push it up:\n\n14. Left (to position (5, 3))\n15. Up (to position (4, 3))\n16. Right (pushing the box from (5, 4) to (5, 5))\n\nOh wait, I made a mistake. I'm now at (4, 3) and the box is at (5, 4). If I move right, I'd go to (4, 4), not (5, 4). So I can't push the box from that position.\n\nLet's rethink:\n\n14. Left (to position (5, 3))\n15. Up (to position (4, 3))\n16. Right (to position (4, 4))\n17. Down (pushing the box from (5, 4) to (6, 4))\n\nBut there's an issue again. If I understand the board correctly, position (6, 4) is an empty space, not outside the board. But what I'm trying to do is to get the box maneuvered in a way that allows me to push it back into a position where I can push it up to the target.\n\nActually, I'm pretty sure the box would be outside the board. The board is 8x8 and the indices go from 0 to 7, so if we're at row index 5, then row index 6 should be the next row down. Plus, the last row is all walls according to the board representation:\n\n```\n01234567  (column)\n0XXXXXXXX\n1XEEXETEX\n2XEXEEETX\n3XIXEBEEX\n4XEEEEEEX\n5XEEEEBEX\n6XEEEXEXX\n7XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nSo I was wrong, row 6 is still within the board. Let's continue with the approach:\n\n14. Left (to position (5, 3))\n15. Up (to position (4, 3))\n16. Right (to position (4, 4))\n17. Down (pushing the box from (5, 4) to (6, 4))\n\nNow I'm at (5, 4) and the box is at (6, 4). I need to get to the left of the box and push it to the right, and then get above it to push it down:\n\n18. Down (to position (6, 3))\n19. Right (pushing the box from (6, 4) to (6, 5))\n20. Up (to position (5, 5))\n21. Up (to position (4, 5))\n22. Up (to position (3, 5))\n23. Up (to position (2, 5))\n24. Right (pushing the box from (2, 6) to (2, 6) (a target))\n\nBut there's a mistake here. At step 23, I'm at (2, 5) and there's no box to push. I think I lost track of the box's position.\n\nLet me restart the approach for the second box from the beginning, and be very careful with tracking the positions of the player and the box.\n\nAfter pushing the first box to its target, I'm at (2, 5) and the second box is at (5, 5). I need to get to the left of the box to push it right.\n\n8. Down\n9. Down\n10. Down\n11. Right\n12. Down (I'm now at (6, 6))\n13. Left (I'm now at (6, 5))\n14. Up (pushing the box from (5, 5) to (4, 5))\n\nNow I'm at (5, 5) and the box is at (4, 5). I need to push the box up.\n\n15. Up (pushing the box from (4, 5) to (3, 5))\n16. Up (pushing the box from (3, 5) to (2, 5))\n17. Left (I'm now at (2, 4))\n18. Right (pushing the box from (2, 5) to (2, 6) (a target))\n\nBut wait, I made a mistake. Let me check steps 11-14:\n\n11. Right (I'm now at (5, 6))\n12. Down (I'm now at (6, 6))\n13. Left (I'm now at (6, 5))\n14. Up (pushing the box from (5, 5) to (4, 5))\n\nI think I got confused because at step 11, the player is in row 5, which is the same row as the box. So let me be more careful:\n\nAfter pushing the first box to its target, I'm at (2, 5) and the second box is at (5, 5).\n\n8. Down (to position (3, 5))\n9. Down (to position (4, 5))\n10. Down (to position (5, 5))\n\nBut now I'm at the same position as the box, which doesn't work. Let me check the board again:\n\n```\n01234567  (column)\n0XXXXXXXX\n1XEEXETEX\n2XEXEEETX\n3XIXEBEEX\n4XEEEEEEX\n5XEEEEBEX\n6XEEEXEXX\n7XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nOh, I think I misread the board. The second box is at row 5, column 5 (not 5, 4). So step 10 wouldn't work because the box is already at (5, 5). I need to avoid moving directly to the box.\n\nLet's try again:\n\n8. Down (to position (3, 5))\n9. Down (to position (4, 5))\n10. Right (to position (4, 6))\n11. Down (to position (5, 6))\n12. Left (pushing the box from (5, 5) to (5, 4))\n\nNow I'm at (5, 5) and the box is at (5, 4). I need to get above the box to push it down. But this becomes a problem because I can't push the box down to (6, 4) because it would then be off the board. I need to find a different approach.\n\nLet's try again in a different way after pushing the first box to its target:\n\n8. Down (to position (3, 5))\n9. Down (to position (4, 5))\n10. Right (to position (4, 6))\n11. Down (to position (5, 6))\n12. Left (pushing the box from (5, 5) to (5, 4))\n\nNow I'm at (5, 5) and the box is at (5, 4). Let me try:\n\n13. Left (to position (5, 3))\n14. Up (to position (4, 3))\n15. Right (to position (4, 4))\n16. Down (pushing the box from (5, 4) to (6, 4))\n\nBut this still won't work because the box would go outside the board. Looking at the board, I can see that row 6, col 4 is inside the board, but I can't push a box to row 7, which would be outside the board.\n\n```\n01234567  (column)\n0XXXXXXXX\n1XEEXETEX\n2XEXEEETX\n3XIXEBEEX\n4XEEEEEEX\n5XEEEEBEX\n6XEEEXEXX\n7XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nSo I'm starting again with a simple approach after pushing the first box to its target:\n\n8. Down (to position (3, 5))\n9. Down (to position (4, 5))\n10. Down (to position (5, 5)) - This won't work as there's a box at (5, 5).\n\nI think the issue is that I've been approaching this from the wrong direction. After pushing the first box to its target, let me move to the right side of the second box:\n\n8. Down (to position (3, 5))\n9. Down (to position (4, 5))\n10. Right (to position (4, 6))\n11. Down (to position (5, 6))\n12. Left (pushing the box from (5, 5) to (5, 4))\n\nNow I'm at (5, 5) and the box is at (5, 4). No wait, I think there's a mistake again. I need to figure out which column the box is at.\n\n```\n01234567  (column)\n0XXXXXXXX\n1XEEXETEX\n2XEXEEETX\n3XIXEBEEX\n4XEEEEEEX\n5XEEEEBEX\n6XEEEXEXX\n7XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nYes, the box is at (5, 5). So step 12 would push the box to (5, 4) and the player would be at (5, 5).\n\n12. Left (pushing the box from (5, 5) to (5, 4))\n\nNow I'm at (5, 5) and the box is at (5, 4). \n\n13. Up (to position (4, 5))\n14. Left (to position (4, 4))\n15. Down (pushing the box from (5, 4) to (6, 4))\n\nNow the player is at (5, 4) and the box is at (6, 4). Wait, but row 7 is the bottom row and has all walls:\n\n```\n01234567  (column)\n0XXXXXXXX\n1XEEXETEX\n2XEXEEETX\n3XIXEBEEX\n4XEEEEEEX\n5XEEEEBEX\n6XEEEXEXX\n7XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nAh, I see it now. Row 7 is the bottom row and is all walls. Row 6 is just above it, and position (6, 4) seems to be an empty space ('E').\n\nSo from here, the player is at (5, 4) and the box is at (6, 4). I can push the box to the right:\n\n16. Down (to position (6, 3))\n17. Right (pushing the box from (6, 4) to (6, 5))\n\nNow the player is at (6, 4) and the box is at (6, 5).\n\n18. Up (to position (5, 5))\n19. Left (to position (5, 4))\n20. Down (to position (6, 4))\n21. Right (to position (6, 5))\n22. Up (pushing the box from (6, 5) to (5, 5))\n23. Up (pushing the box from (5, 5) to (4, 5))\n24. Up (pushing the box from (4, 5) to (3, 5))\n25. Up (pushing the box from (3, 5) to (2, 5))\n26. Right (pushing the box from (2, 5) to (2, 6) (a target))\n\nI think this sequence should work! Let me double-check for any issues:\n\n```\n01234567  (column)\n0XXXXXXXX\n1XEEXETEX\n2XEXEEETX\n3XIXEBEEX\n4XEEEEEEX\n5XEEEEBEX\n6XEEEXEXX\n7XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nOh wait, I need to be careful as there's a wall at (6, 6):\n\n```\n01234567  (column)\n0XXXXXXXX\n1XEEXETEX\n2XEXEEETX\n3XIXEBEEX\n4XEEEEEEX\n5XEEEEBEX\n6XEEEXEXX\n7XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nI was wrong again. Position (6, 6) is empty ('E'). I think I just need to avoid position (6, 7) as there's a wall there.\n\nSo from here, the player is at (5, 4) and the box is at (6, 4).\n\n16. Down (to position (6, 3)) - Wait, there's no row 6, column 3 in the diagram. I'm going out of bounds. Let me check again.\n\n```\n01234567  (column)\n0XXXXXXXX\n1XEEXETEX\n2XEXEEETX\n3XIXEBEEX\n4XEEEEEEX\n5XEEEEBEX\n6XEEEXEXX\n7XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nRow 6, column 3 has an 'E', so it's a valid position. I don't know why I thought it wasn't.\n\n16. Down (to position (6, 3))\n17. Right (pushing the box from (6, 4) to (6, 5))\n\nNow the player is at (6, 4) and the box is at (6, 5). I need to get above the box to push it up.\n\n18. Right (to position (6, 5)) - This would push the box, not just move the player.\n\nOK, let's try a different approach. After step 15, the player is at (5, 4) and the box is at (6, 4):\n\n16. Right (to position (5, 5))\n17. Down (to position (6, 5))\n18. Left (pushing the box from (6, 4) to (6, 3))\n19. Up (to position (5, 3))\n20. Left (to position (5, 2))\n21. Down (to position (6, 2))\n22. Right (pushing the box from (6, 3) to (6, 4))\n23. Right (pushing the box from (6, 4) to (6, 5))\n24. Up (pushing the box from (6, 5) to (5, 5))\n25. Up (pushing the box from (5, 5) to (4, 5))\n26. Up (pushing the box from (4, 5) to (3, 5))\n27. Up (pushing the box from (3, 5) to (2, 5))\n28. Right (pushing the box from (2, 5) to (2, 6) (a target))\n\nI think this sequence should work. Let me review once more to ensure there are no inconsistencies.\n\nAfter step 22, I'm at (6, 3) and the box is at (6, 4). If I move right, I'd go to position (6, 4) and the box would move to (6, 5). This is correct.\n\nAfter step 23, I'm at (6, 4) and the box is at (6, 5). If I move up, I'd go to position (5, 5) and the box would move to (5, 5). This is correct.\n\nThe rest of the steps seem correct as well.\n\nLet me list out the full solution:\n\n1. Right\n2. Right\n3. Right\n4. Down\n5. Right\n6. Up (pushing the first box up)\n7. Up (pushing the first box up to the target)\n8. Down\n9. Down\n10. Down\n11. Right\n12. Down\n13. Left (pushing the second box left)\n14. Left\n15. Up\n16. Left\n17. Down\n18. Right (pushing the box right)\n19. Up (pushing the box up)\n20. Up (pushing the box up)\n21. Up (pushing the box up)\n22. Up (pushing the box up)\n23. Right (pushing the box right to the target)\n\nI think there are steps missing. Let me trace through more carefully.\n\nStart: Player at (3, 1), boxes at (3, 5) and (5, 5).\n1. Right: Player at (3, 2).\n2. Right: Player at (3, 3).\n3. Right: Player at (3, 4).\n4. Down: Player at (4, 4).\n5. Right: Player at (4, 5).\n6. Up: Player pushes box from (3, 5) to (2, 5).

Down: Player at (5, 6).\n12. Left: Player pushes box from (5, 5) to (5, 4). Player at (5, 5).\n13. Left: Player at (5, 3).\n14. Up: Player at (4, 3).\n15. Right: Player at (4, 4).\n16. Down: Player pushes box from (5, 4) to (6, 4). Player at (5, 4).\n17. Right: Player at (5, 5).\n18. Down: Player at (6, 5).\n19. Left: Player pushes box from (6, 4) to (6, 3). Player at (6, 4).\n20. Up: Player at (5, 4).\n21. Left: Player at (5, 3).\n22. Left: Player at (5, 2).\n23. Down: Player at (6, 2).\n24. Right: Player pushes box from (6, 3) to (6, 4). Player at (6, 3).\n25. Right: Player pushes box from (6, 4) to (6, 5). Player at (6, 4).\n26. Up: Player pushes box from (6, 5) to (5, 5). Player at (6, 5).\n27. Up: Player pushes box from (5, 5) to (4, 5). Player at (5, 5).\n28. Up: Player pushes box from (4, 5) to (3, 5). Player at (4, 5).\n29. Up: Player pushes box from (3, 5) to (2, 5). Player at (3, 5).\n30. Left: Player at (3, 4).\n31. Up: Player at (2, 4).\n32. Right: Player pushes box from (2, 5) to (2, 6) (a target). Player at (2, 5).\n\nThis should indeed work. The sequence is:\nright, right, right, down, right, up, up, down, down, right, down, left, left, up, right, down, right, down, left, up, left, left, down, right, right, up, up, up, up, left, up, rightI'll work on solving this Sokoban puzzle step by step.\n\nLooking at the game board:\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEXETEX\nXEXEEETX\nXIXEBEEX\nXEEEEEEX\nXEEEEBEX\nXEEEXEXX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nI notice that:\n- The player (I) is at row 3, column 1\n- There are two boxes (B): one at row 3, column 5 and another at row 5, column 5\n- There are two targets (T): one at row 1, column 5 and another at row 2, column 6\n- The goal is to push both boxes to the target areas\n\nLet me solve this methodically:\n\n### First, I'll push the first box (row 3, column 5) to the first target (row 1, column 5):\n1.

I'm guessing 'E' might represent empty spaces. Let me proceed with this assumption.\n\nSo, the board would be:\n- 'I' is the player's position.\n- 'B' are boxes.\n- 'T' are target areas.\n- 'X' are walls.\n- 'E' seem to be empty spaces.\n\nLet's identify the positions:\n- Player (I) is at position [5, 3] (counting from 0, row then column).\n- One box (B) is at position [3, 2] and another is at position [5, 2].\n- Target areas (T) are at positions [2, 2] and [4, 7].\n\nMy goal is to push all boxes onto target areas.\n\nWait, let me count again. I see:\n- Player (I) is at position (5, 3)\n- Boxes (B) are at positions (3, 2) and (5, 2)\n- Target areas (T) are at positions (2, 2) and (4, 7)\n\nHmm, this doesn't match up right. Let me double-check the board. I might have the rows and columns mixed up or counted wrong.\n\nAh, I think I was counting ambiguously. If I number the positions from the top-left corner, starting with (0, 0):\n\n```\n(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (0,5) (0,6) (0,7)\n(1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7)\n...\n```\n\nThen:\n- Player (I) is at position (5, 3).\n- Boxes (B) are at positions (3, 2) and (5, 2).\n- Target areas (T) are at positions (2, 2) and (4, 7).\n\nActually, before I proceed, let me fully interpret the board again to make sure we are on the same page.\n\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXXEXXEEX\nXETXXEEX\nXEBEEEXX\nXEEEEETX\nXXBIEEXX\nXEEEEXEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nInterpreting:\n- X: walls\n- E: empty spaces\n- T: target areas\n- B: boxes\n- I: player\n\nSo, from the top-left (0, 0):\n- Player (I) is at (5, 3).\n- Boxes (B) are at (3, 2) and (5, 2).\n- Target areas (T) are at (2, 2) and (4, 7).\n\nAh, I'm still getting confused. Let me correct myself and make sure I'm consistent:\n\nIf I consider (row, column) starting from the top-left as (0, 0), then:\n\nRow 0: XXXXXXXX\nRow 1: XXEXXEEX\nRow 2: XETXXEEX\nRow 3: XEBEEEXX\nRow 4: XEEEEETX\nRow 5: XXBIEEXX\nRow 6: XEEEEXEX\nRow 7: XXXXXXXX\n\n- Player (I) is at (5, 3).\n- Boxes (B) are at (3, 2) and (5, 2).\n- Target areas (T) are at (2, 2) and (4, 7).\n\nWait, I only see one box (B) at (3, 2) and another character (which could be a box) at (5, 2), but the game board shows it as 'I' (the player). Let me re-check...\n\nOk, I see the confusion. Here's a more careful analysis:\n\nRow 0: XXXXXXXX\nRow 1: XXEXXEEX\nRow 2: XETXXEEX\nRow 3: XEBEEEXX\nRow 4: XEEEEETX\nRow 5: XXBIEEXX\nRow 6: XEEEEXEX\nRow 7: XXXXXXXX\n\nFrom this:\n- Player (I) is at (5, 3).\n- Boxes (B) are at (3, 2) and (5, 2).\n- Target areas (T) are at (2, 2) and (4, 7).\n\nBut this contradicts what I see in the board at (5, 2). Let me double check again...\n\nAh, I see. I think I've been reading the board incorrectly. Let me define the positions again:\n\nRow 0: XXXXXXXX\nRow 1: XXEXXEEX\nRow 2: XETXXEEX\nRow 3: XEBEEEXX\nRow 4: XEEEEETX\nRow 5: XXBIEEXX\nRow 6: XEEEEXEX\nRow 7: XXXXXXXX\n\nNow I'll map out the positions of the key elements (now in (row, col) format):\n- Player (I) is at (5, 3).\n- One box (B) is at (3, 2) and another box (B) is at (5, 2).\n- Target areas (T) are at (2, 2) and (4, 7).\n\nAlright, I think I got it straight this time. So we want to push the boxes to the target areas. Let me plan a solution.\n\nFirst, I'll move to a position where I can push the first box (at (3, 2)) towards the target area (at (2, 2)). Then, I'll push the second box (at (5, 2)) towards the second target area (at (4, 7)).\n\nStarting with the player at (5, 3), let's move to a position where I can push the box at (3, 2) upwards.\n\n1. To push the box at (3, 2) upwards to (2, 2), I need to be at (4, 2).\n2. Starting from (5, 3), I'll move:\n   - up to (4, 3)\n   - left to (4, 2)\n   - up to (3, 2) (this would push the box to (2, 2))\n\nWait, this doesn't match up with the game board. Let me redo this entirely.\n\nHere's the game board:\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXXEXXEEX\nXETXXEEX\nXEBEEEXX\nXEEEEETX\nXXBIEEXX\nXEEEEXEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nI need to first remind myself of the rules:\n- X: walls\n- E: empty spaces\n- T: target areas\n- B: boxes\n- I: player\n\nLooking at the board, I parse it as:\n```\n00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07\n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17\n20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27\n30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37\n40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47\n50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57\n60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67\n70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77\n```\n\n- Player (I) is at (5, 3)\n- Boxes (B) are at (3, 2) and (5, 2)\n- Target areas (T) are at (2, 2) and (4, 7)\n\nHmm, let me once again re-check the positions:\n\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXXEXXEEX\nXETXXEEX\nXEBEEEXX\nXEEEEETX\nXXBIEEXX\nXEEEEXEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nWait, one more time:\n\nRow 0: XXXXXXXX\nRow 1: XXEXXEEX\nRow 2: XETXXEEX\nRow 3: XEBEEEXX\nRow 4: XEEEEETX\nRow 5: XXBIEEXX\nRow 6: XEEEEXEX\nRow 7: XXXXXXXX\n\nOk, I'll map the positions more carefully:\n- (0, 0) to (0, 7) is Row 0\n- (1, 0) to (1, 7) is Row 1\n- And so on...\n\nNow I'll find the positions of the key elements:\n- Player (I) is at (5, 3).\n- Boxes (B) are at (3, 2) and (5, 2).\n- Target areas (T) are at (2, 2) and (4, 7).\n\nLet me double check again:\n```\n01234567\n0XXXXXXXX\n1XXEXXEEX\n2XETXXEEX\n3XEBEEEXX\n4XEEEEETX\n5XXBIEEXX\n6XEEEEXEX\n7XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nPlayer (I) is at (5, 3). Yes, that's correct.\nOne box (B) is at (3, 2). Yes, that's correct.\nWait, there should be another box at (5, 2), but I don't see it in the game board. Let me double check...\n\nIn the row 5 (which is the 6th row from the top), the characters are \"XXBIEEXX\". The 'B' is at position 2, not 1, and the 'I' is at position 3. So, there's a box at (5, 2).\n\nNow, let's see where the target areas are. In the row 2 (which is the 3rd row from the top), I see a 'T' at position 2. And in the row 4 (which is the 5th row from the top), I see a 'T' at position 7. So, the target areas are at (2, 2) and (4, 7).\n\nSo my understanding is correct. The goal is to push the boxes at (3, 2) and (5, 2) to the target areas at (2, 2) and (4, 7).\n\nLet's now develop a solution step by step.\n\nStarting position:\n- Player (I) is at (5, 3).\n- Boxes (B) are at (3, 2) and (5, 2).\n- Target areas (T) are at (2, 2) and (4, 7).\n\nStep 1: Let's push the box at (3, 2) to the target area at (2, 2).\nTo do this, I need to be at (4, 2) and push the box upwards. But there's no direct path to (4, 2) from (5, 3). Let me check if I can go around.\n\nI have to go around the left side. From (5, 3), I can move left to (5, 2). But there's a box there, so I'd have to push it left to (5, 1), but there's a wall there. So this doesn't work.\n\nLet me try going right. I can move right to (5, 4), then up to (4, 4), then left to (4, 3), then left again to (4, 2), then up to (3, 2), which would push the box to (2, 2).\n\nSo the first part of my solution is:\n1. right (from (5, 3) to (5, 4))\n2. up (from (5, 4) to (4, 4))\n3. left (from (4, 4) to (4, 3))\n4. left (from (4, 3) to (4, 2))\n5. up (from (4, 2) to (3, 2), pushing the box to (2, 2))\n\nNow, the box is on the target at (2, 2), and I'm at (3, 2).\n\nStep 2: Let's move the box at (5, 2) to the target area at (4, 7).\nFrom (3, 2), I need to go to (5, 1) to push the box from (5, 2) to the right. I'll move down to (4, 2), then down to (5, 2), which would actually push the box to (5, 3).\n\nActually this doesn't work because I would need to get behind the box. I'll have to rethink my approach.\n\nLet's see if I can get to (5, 1) somehow to push the box rightwards. From (3, 2), I can move down to (4, 2), then left to (4, 1), then down to (5, 1). From there, I can push the box right from (5, 2) to (5, 3).\n\nSo the next part of the solution is:\n6. down (from (3, 2) to (4, 2))\n7. left (from (4, 2) to (4, 1))\n8. down (from (4, 1) to (5, 1))\n9. right (from (5, 1) to (5, 2), pushing the box to (5, 3))\n\nWait, there's a problem. I forgot to check if the spaces are empty. Let me review my steps and the game board again.\n\n```\n01234567\n0XXXXXXXX\n1XXEXXEEX\n2XETXXEEX\n3XEBEEEXX\n4XEEEEETX\n5XXBIEEXX\n6XEEEEXEX\n7XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nStep 1 (pushing the box at (3, 2) to (2, 2)):\n1. right (from (5, 3) to (5, 4))\n2. up (from (5, 4) to (4, 4))\n3. left (from (4, 4) to (4, 3))\n4. left (from (4, 3) to (4, 2))\n5. up (from (4, 2) to (3, 2), pushing the box to (2, 2))\n\nThese steps seem valid based on the board.\n\nStep 2 (pushing the box at (5, 2) to (4, 7)):\n6. down (from (3, 2) to (4, 2))\n\nWait, (3, 2) is now empty after I pushed the box, so this is valid.\n\n7. left (from (4, 2) to (4, 1))\n\n(4, 1) is an empty space, so this is valid.\n\n8. down (from (4, 1) to (5, 1))\n\n(5, 1) is a wall, so this step is not valid. I need to re-plan.\n\nLet me think about this differently. I need to get from (3, 2) to a position from where I can push the box at (5, 2) towards the target at (4, 7).\n\nI cant push this box upwards to (4, 2) because there's a wall at (3, 1). I can't push it leftwards because there's a wall at (5, 1). I can only push it rightwards from (5, 2) to (5, 3) and so on.\n\nTo do that, I need to get to (5, 1). But there's a wall there. So I can't actually directly push the box at (5, 2). I need to think creatively.\n\nAfter placing the first box at (2, 2), I am at (3, 2). Maybe I can:\n1. Move right to (3, 3)\n2. Move right to (3, 4)\n3. Move right to (3, 5)\n4. Move right to (3, 6)\n5. Move down to (4, 6)\n6. Move right to (4, 7) (which is a target area)\n7. Move down to (5, 7)\n8. Move left to (5, 6)\n9. Move left to (5, 5)\n10. Move left to (5, 4)\n11. Move left to (5, 3)\n12. Move left to (5, 2) (this would push the box to (5, 1), but there's a wall there, so this doesn't work)\n\nThis approach doesn't work. Let me rethink.\n\nAfter placing the first box at (2, 2), I am at (3, 2). I need to get to a position from where I can push the box at (5, 2) towards the target at (4, 7).\n\nActually, I want to push the second box rightwards all the way to the target at (4, 7). I'll have to get behind it. Let's see if I can get to (5, 1), but I already established there's a wall there.\n\nWait, I'm mixing up the board again. Let's be precise:\n\n```\n01234567\n0XXXXXXXX\n1XXEXXEEX\n2XETXXEEX\n3XEBEEEXX\n4XEEEEETX\n5XXBIEEXX\n6XEEEEXEX\n7XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nSo there's a box at (5, 2) and a player at (5, 3). I need to push the box from (5, 2) to (4, 7).\n\nI have to get behind the box, which means I need to get to position (5, 1). But there seems to be a wall at (5, 1). I don't think I can directly push the box at (5, 2) leftwards.\n\nLet's see, maybe I can go around and push it from a different direction. If I can get to (4, 2), I could push the box upwards. Let's try to get to (4, 2) from (5, 3).\n\nFrom (5, 3), I could move right to (5, 4), then up to (4, 4), then left to (4, 3), then left again to (4, 2). From there, I could push the box upwards from (5, 2) to (4, 2).\n\nSo, for the second box, I could do:\n1. right (from (5, 3) to (5, 4))\n2. up (from (5, 4) to (4, 4))\n3. left (from (4, 4) to (4, 3))\n4. left (from (4, 3) to (4, 2))\n5. down (from (4, 2) to (5, 2), pushing the box to (6, 2))\n\nBut (6, 2) is not a target area. It's (4, 7). So this approach doesn't directly get me to the target.\n\nActually, I just realized something. I've been assuming there are two boxes, but I'm only seeing one box (B) on the game board, at position (3, 2). The other box I thought was at (5, 2) seems to be the player (I). Let me verify:\n\n```\n01234567\n0XXXXXXXX\n1XXEXXEEX\n2XETXXEEX\n3XEBEEEXX\n4XEEEEETX\n5XXBIEEXX\n6XEEEEXEX\n7XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nRow 5 (index 5) has \"XXBIEEXX\". The 'B' is at index 2, and the 'I' is at index 3. So there's a box at (5, 2) and the player is at (5, 3).\n\nOk, so I was right all along. There are two boxes: one at (3, 2) and another at (5, 2).\n\nSince I can't push the box at (5, 2) leftwards (there's a wall at (5, 1)), and I can't push it directly upwards from (5, 2) to (4, 2) (I'd need to be at (6, 2) to do that, but there's a wall at (5, 1) blocking my way), I'll have to think of another approach.\n\nLet me try to get to (6, 2) from (5, 3). I could move right to (5, 4), then down to (6, 4), then left to (6, 3), then left again to (6, 2). Then I could push the box upwards from (5, 2) to (4, 2).\n\nBut why am I trying to push the box upwards? I should be thinking about how to get it to the target at (4, 7), which means I should be pushing it rightwards towards that position.\n\nHmm, I've been overthinking this. I apologize for the confusion. Let's simplify the problem.\n\nInitially:\n- Player (I) is at (5, 3).\n- Boxes (B) are at (3, 2) and (5, 2).\n- Target areas (T) are at (2, 2) and (4, 7).\n\nFirst, I want to push the box from (3, 2) to the target at (2, 2):\n1. right (from (5, 3) to (5, 4))\n2. up (from (5, 4) to (4, 4))\n3. left (from (4, 4) to (4, 3))\n4. left (from (4, 3) to (4, 2))\n5. up (from (4, 2) to (3, 2), pushing the box to (2, 2))\n\nNext, I want to push the box from (5, 2) to the target at (4, 7).\n\nTo push the box rightwards, I need to be at (5, 1), but there's a wall there. So, I can't push it directly rightwards.\n\nTo push the box upwards, I need to be at (6, 2). Let's see if I can get there.\n\nFrom (3, 2), I could move:\n6. down (from (3, 2) to (4, 2))\n7. down (from (4, 2) to (5, 2), but this would push the box to (6, 2), which is not what I want)\n\nIn order to push the box up to (4, 2), I need to be on the bottom side of it. But if the box is at (5, 2) and I'm at (6, 2), the wall at (5, 1) would make it impossible for me to get to the left side of the box to push it rightwards.\n\nI think I've been missing something in my analysis.\n\nLet me re-check the specific board layout I've been given.\n\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXXEXXEEX\nXETXXEEX\nXEBEEEXX\nXEEEEETX\nXXBIEEXX\nXEEEEXEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nActually, I've been misinterpreting the board again (which is making this very annoying). Let me re-parse with indices:\n\n```\n01234567\n0XXXXXXXX\n1XXEXXEEX\n2XETXXEEX\n3XEBEEEXX\n4XEEEEETX\n5XXBIEEXX\n6XEEEEXEX\n7XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nPlayer (I) is at (5, 3).\nBoxes (B) are at (3, 2) and (5, 2).\n\nWait, I don't see a box 'B' at (5, 2). In row 5, I see \"XXBIEEXX\". The 'B' is at index 2 and the 'I' is at index 3. So there's a box at (5, 2) and a player at (5, 3). One more sanity check: at position (3, 2), there's also a 'B' (box).\n\nOk, so there are two boxes: one at (3, 2) and another at (5, 2).\n\nTarget areas (T) are at (2, 2) and (4, 7).\n\nLet me think this through again:\n\nI want to push the box from (3, 2) to the target at (2, 2). To do that, I need to be at (4, 2). Then I can push the box upwards. This is doable.\n\nBut, I also need to push the box from (5, 2) to the target at (4, 7). To push it upwards, I need to be at (6, 2). Let's see if I can get to (6, 2) from (3, 2) after pushing the first box.\n\nFrom (3, 2), I can go down to (4, 2), then down again to (5, 2), which would push the box to (6, 2). This seems like a valid move. I'm not sure if I can get to the target from there, but let's continue (and assume the empty spaces are 'E')\n\nNext, I need to push the box from (6, 2) to the target at (4, 7). To do that, I need to push it upwards and then rightwards.\n\nFrom (5, 2), I can go right to (5, 3), then down to (6, 3), then left to (6, 2). From there, I can push the box upwards from (6, 2) to (5, 2). Next, I can go around to position (4, 2) to push the box further upwards from (5, 2) to (4, 2).\n\nFrom there, I can push the box rightwards all the way to the target at (4, 7).\n\nLet me verify this approach with the actual moves:\n\nInitial phase:\n- Player (I) is at (5, 3).\n- Boxes (B) are at (3, 2) and (5, 2).\n- Target areas (T) are at (2, 2) and (4, 7).\n\nFirst, push the box from (3, 2) to the target at (2, 2):\n1. right (from (5, 3) to (5, 4))\n2. up (from (5, 4) to (4, 4))\n3. left (from (4, 4) to (4, 3))\n4. left (from (4, 3) to (4, 2))\n5. up (from (4, 2) to (3, 2), pushing the box to (2, 2))\n\nNext, push the box from (5, 2) to the target at (4, 7):\n6. down (from (3, 2) to (4, 2))\n7. down (from (4, 2) to (5, 2), pushing the box to (6, 2))\n8. right (from (5, 2) to (5, 3))\n9. down (from (5, 3) to (6, 3))\n10. left (from (6, 3) to (6, 2))\n11. up (from (6, 2) to (5, 2), pushing the box to (4, 2))\n12. right (from (5, 2) to (5, 3))\n13. up (from (5, 3) to (4, 3))\n14. right (from (4, 3) to (4, 4))\n15. right (from (4, 4) to (4, 5))\n16. right (from (4, 5) to (4, 6))\n17. right (from (4, 6) to (4, 7))\n\nBut there's a problem: at step 17, I'm pushing the box from (4, 6) to (4, 7). So, the player will be at (4, 6), and the box will be at (4, 7).\n\nHmm, actually, I think this is correct! The target area is at (4, 7), and the box is at (4, 7) after I push it. So, the box is on the target.\n\nActually, let me double check this. The steps 12-17 are pushing the box to the right to get it to the target. At step 11, the box is at (4, 2). But I would need to push the box from the left side, which means I need to be at (4, 1). But (4, 1) is an empty space in the board, so this is valid.\n\nActually, let me re-check the board:\n```\n01234567\n0XXXXXXXX\n1XXEXXEEX\n2XETXXEEX\n3XEBEEEXX\n4XEEEEETX\n5XXBIEEXX\n6XEEEEXEX\n7XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nWait, how can I push the box from (4, 2) to (4, 3)? I need to be at (4, 1). But there's a wall at (4, 0). So, I can't get to (4, 1). I need to reconsider.\n\nHmm, in step 11, I'm pushing the box from (5, 2) to (4, 2). But this would mean I'm at (6, 2) and the box is at (5, 2). If I push upwards, the box will move to (4, 2), but I'll still be at (5, 2). I can't directly move to position (4, 1) from there.\n\nActually at this point, I can move up to (4, 2), right to (4, 3), up to (3, 3), left to (3, 2), left to (3, 1), down to (4, 1), and then right to (4, 2), which would push the box to (4, 3). From there, I can push the box to the right until it reaches the target at (4, 7).\n\nLet me restate the full solution to ensure clarity:\n\nInitial phase:\n- Player (I) is at (5, 3).\n- Boxes (B) are at (3, 2) and (5, 2).\n- Target areas (T) are at (2, 2) and (4, 7).\n\nFirst, push the box from (3, 2) to the target at (2, 2):\n1. right (from (5, 3) to (5, 4))\n2. up (from (5, 4) to (4, 4))\n3. left (from (4, 4) to (4, 3))\n4. left (from (4, 3) to (4, 2))\n5. up (from (4, 2) to (3, 2), pushing the box to (2, 2))\n\nNext, push the box from (5, 2) to the target at (4, 7):\n6. down (from (3, 2) to (4, 2))\n7. down (from (4, 2) to (5, 2), pushing the box to (6, 2))\n8. right (from (5, 2) to (5, 3))\n9. down (from (5, 3) to (6, 3))\n10. left (from (6, 3) to (6, 2))\n11. up (from (6, 2) to (5, 2), pushing the box to (4, 2))\n12. up (from (5, 2) to (4, 2))\n13. right (from (4, 2) to (4, 3))\n14. up (from (4, 3) to (3, 3))\n15. left (from (3, 3) to (3, 2))\n16. left (from (3, 2) to (3, 1))\n17. down (from (3, 1) to (4, 1))\n18. right (from (4, 1) to (4, 2), pushing the box to (4, 3))\n19. right (from (4, 2) to (4, 3), pushing the box to (4, 4))\n20. right (from (4, 3) to (4, 4), pushing the box to (4, 5))\n21. right (from (4, 4) to (4, 5), pushing the box to (4, 6))\n22. right (from (4, 5) to (4, 6), pushing the box to (4, 7))\n\nAnd that's the full solution! I've pushed both boxes to their target areas.\n\nActually, hold on, let me quickly go through this solution one more time to make sure it's accurate.\n\nInitial:\n- Player (I) is at (5, 3).\n- Boxes (B) are at (3, 2) and (5, 2).\n- Target areas (T) are at (2, 2) and (4, 7).\n\nFirst, push the box from (3, 2) to the target at (2, 2):\n1. right (from (5, 3) to (5, 4)) - valid\n2. up (from (5, 4) to (4, 4)) - valid\n3. left (from (4, 4) to (4, 3)) - valid\n4. left (from (4, 3) to (4, 2)) - valid\n5. up (from (4, 2) to (3, 2), pushing the box to (2, 2)) - valid, and box is now at the target.\n\nAfter these moves:\n- Player (I) is at (3, 2).\n- Boxes (B) are at (2, 2) (on target) and (5, 2).\n- Target areas (T) are at (2, 2) (with box) and (4, 7).\n\nNext, push the box from (5, 2) to the target at (4, 7):\n6. down (from (3, 2) to (4, 2)) - valid\n7. down (from (4, 2) to (5, 2), pushing the box to (6, 2)) - valid\n\nWait, at step 7, I'm pushing the box from (5, 2) to (6, 2). But the box is not at (6, 2) at the beginning. I'm getting confused again. Let me clarify with the board:\n\n```\n01234567\n0XXXXXXXX\n1XXEXXEEX\n2XETXXEEX\n3XEBEEEXX\n4XEEEEETX\n5XXBIEEXX\n6XEEEEXEX\n7XXXXXXXX\n```\n\nAt this point in the game (after the first 5 moves), the player is at (3, 2), one box is at (2, 2) on a target, and the other box is still at (5, 2).\n\nSo, from (3, 2), I want to push the box from (5, 2) to the target at (4, 7).\n\nI need to get to a position where I can push this box. If I want to push it upwards, I need to be at (6, 2). But can I reach (6, 2) from (3, 2)? Let's see.\n\nFrom (3, 2), I can move down to (4, 2). Then:\n1. If I try to move down to (5, 2), I'd be pushing the box at (5, 2) to (6, 2). This is valid.\n2. Or, I can move right to (4, 3), then down to (5, 3), which would put me to the right of the box. I could then push the box leftwards to (5, 1), but there's a wall there.\n3. Or, I can move left to (4, 1), then down to (5, 1), which would put me to the left of the box. I could then push the box rightwards. But I can't get to (5, 1) because there's a wall there.\n\nSo, option 1 seems to be the only valid one. I'll push the box from (5, 2) to (6, 2).\n\n6. down (from (3, 2) to (4, 2)) - valid\n7. down (from (4, 2) to (5, 2), pushing the box to (6, 2)) - valid, and the box is now at (6, 2).\n\nAfter these moves:\n- Player (I) is at (5, 2).\n- Boxes (B) are at (2, 2) (on target) and (6, 2).\n- Target areas (T) are at (2, 2) (with box) and (4, 7).\n\nNow, to push the box from (6, 2) to the target at (4, 7), I need to push it upwards to (5, 2), then to (4, 2), and then rightwards to (4, 7).\n\nFirst, let me try to get behind the box at (6, 2):\n8. right (from (5, 2) to (5, 3)) - valid\n9. down (from (5, 3) to (6, 3)) - valid\n10. left (from (6, 3) to (6, 2)) - valid, I'm now behind the box.\n\nNext, let me push the box upwards:\n11. up (from (6, 2) to (5, 2), pushing the box to (4, 2)) - valid, and the box is now at (4, 2).\n\nAfter these moves:\n- Player (I) is at (5, 2).\n- Boxes (B) are at (2, 2) (on target) and (4, 2).\n- Target areas (T) are at (2, 2) (with box) and (4, 7).\n\nNow, I need to push the box from (4, 2) rightwards to (4, 7). But how can I get to (4, 1) to push the box rightwards? There's a wall at (4, 0).\n\nActually, I can go up to (4, 2), right to (4, 3), up to (3, 3), left to (3, 2), left to (3, 1), down to (4, 1), and then right to (4, 2), which would push the box to (4, 3). From there, I can push the box to the right until it reaches the target at (4, 7).\n\nLet me verify:\n12. up (from (5, 2) to (4, 2)) - valid (I'm at the same position as the box, so this actually doesn't push the box)\n13. right (from (4, 2) to (4, 3)) - valid\n14. up (from (4, 3) to (3, 3)) - valid\n15. left (from (3, 3) to (3, 2)) - valid\n16. left (from (3, 2) to (3, 1)) - valid\n17. down (from (3, 1) to (4, 1)) - valid\n18. right (from (4, 1) to (4, 2), pushing the box to (4, 3)) - valid\n\nAt this point, the box is at (4, 3) and I want to push it further rightwards to (4, 7).\n\n19. right (from (4, 2) to (4, 3), pushing the box to (4, 4)) - valid\n20. right (from (4, 3) to (4, 4), pushing the box to (4, 5)) - valid\n21. right (from (4, 4) to (4, 5), pushing the box to (4, 6)) - valid\n22. right (from (4, 5) to (4, 6), pushing the box to (4, 7)) - valid, and the box is now at the target.\n\nFinal state:\n- Player (I) is at (4, 6).\n- Boxes (B) are at (2, 2) (on target) and (4, 7) (on target).\n- Target areas (T) are at (2, 2) (with box) and (4, 7) (with box).\n\nPerfect! I've verified the solution.\n\nSo, the solution is:\n1. right\n2. up\n3. left\n4. left\n5. up\n6. down\n7. down\n8. right\n9. down\n10. left\n11. up\n12. up\n13. right\n14. up\n15. left\n16. left\n17. down\n18. right\n19. right\n20. right\n21. right\n22. right# Sokoban Solution\n\nLooking at the game board:\n```\nXXXXXXXX\nXXEXXEEX\nXETXXEEX\nXEBEEEXX\nXEEEEETX\nXXBIEEXX\nXEEEEXEX\nXXXXXXXX\n```\n\nI notice:\n- Player (I) is at position (5,3)\n- Boxes (B) are at positions (3,2) and (5,2)\n- Target areas (T) are at positions (2,2) and (4,7)\n- The rest is walls (X) and empty spaces (E)\n\n## Strategy:\n1.

The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER' (without quotes), where YOUR_ANSWER is your final answer to the question,e.g.\"Answer: ['up','down','down',...]\"\nNext, I will provide you with a Sokoban puzzle. You need to give a solution (push all boxes into the target areas) as a list. The map symbols are:\n\n- 'I' indicates the player's position.\n- 'B' indicates boxes.\n- 'T' indicates target areas where boxes should be moved.\n- 'X' indicates walls.\n\nYou can choose from the following movements:\n\n- 'up' indicates moving one step upward.\n- 'down' indicates moving one step downward.\n- 'left' indicates moving one step to the left.\n- 'right' indicates moving one step to the right.\n\nImportant rules to remember:\n\n- The player can push only one box at a time. If two boxes are aligned in the moving direction, the player cannot push them.\n- Walls block the player's movement.\n- The game is won only when all boxes are pushed into target areas.\n- You must output the solution as a list of strings with each move in lowercase, e.g., \"Answer: ['up','down','down',...]\".\n\nGame Board:\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEXX\nXEBTEEEX\nXXXXEEEX\nXEXXEEEX\nXIEEEEEX\nXEEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n\n","epoch":1,"seed":49,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
