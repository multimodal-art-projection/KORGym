The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER' (without quotes), where YOUR_ANSWER is your final answer to the question,e.g.\"Answer: ['up','down','down',...]\"\nNext, I will provide you with a Sokoban puzzle. You need to give a solution (push all boxes into the target areas) as a list. The map symbols are:\n\n- 'I' indicates the player's position.\n- 'B' indicates boxes.\n- 'T' indicates target areas where boxes should be moved.\n- 'X' indicates walls.\n\nYou can choose from the following movements:\n\n- 'up' indicates moving one step upward.\n- 'down' indicates moving one step downward.\n- 'left' indicates moving one step to the left.\n- 'right' indicates moving one step to the right.\n\nImportant rules to remember:\n\n- The player can push only one box at a time. If two boxes are aligned in the moving direction, the player cannot push them.\n- Walls block the player's movement.\n- The game is won only when all boxes are pushed into target areas.\n- You must output the solution as a list of strings with each move in lowercase, e.g., \"Answer: ['up','down','down',...]\".\n\nGame Board:\nXXXXXXXX\nXEEEEEXX\nXEBTEEEX\nXXXXEEEX\nXEXXEEEX\nXIEEEEEX\nXEEEEEEX\nXXXXXXXX\n\n","epoch":1,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
