Then we handle the second box by pushing it right twice and then down twice to reach its target at (6,4).\n\nStep 1. Solve the box at (3,4):\n• To push the box right, the player must be to its left. Starting at (5,1), the player goes:\n 1. up → moves to (4,1)  \n 2. up → moves to (3,1)  \n 3. right → moves to (3,2)  \n 4. right → moves to (3,3)  \nNow the player is at (3,3) and immediately left of the box at (3,4).  \n 5. right → pushes the box from (3,4) to (3,5) and the player moves to (3,4).\n\nStep 2. Solve the box at (4,2):\nNow the box at (4,2) must get to the target at (6,4).

To execute Push 2 (pushing the box right to (2,5)), the player (already at (2,3)) simply moves \"right\": this pushes the box from (2,4) to (2,5), and the player goes to (2,4).\n\n• Next, to push the box down from (2,5) to (3,5) (Push 3), the player must be above the box (at (1,5)). From (2,4), the player can go \"up\" to (1,4) and then \"right\" to (1,5). Then a \"down\" move puts the player into (2,5) and pushes the box to (3,5).\n\n• For Push 4 (pushing the box from (3,5) to (4,5)), while the player is at (2,5) (directly above the box), a \"down\" move pushes it, sending the player to (3,5) and the box to (4,5).\n\n• For Push 5 (pushing the box from (4,5) to (5,5)), from (3,5) the player moves \"down\" again, pushing the box and moving into (4,5) with the box arriving at (5,5).\n\n• Now for Push 6 (pushing the box right from (5,5) to (5,6)), the player must be to the left of the box, at (5,4). The player is currently at (4,5), so reposition by moving \"left\" to (4,4) and then \"down\" to (5,4). Then a \"right\" move pushes the box from (5,5) to (5,6); the player ends up at (5,5).\n\n• Finally, for Push 7 (pushing the box down from (5,6) to (6,6)), the player must be above the box (at (4,6)).

There are two target positions: one T at (2,2) and the other at (6,6).\n\nA good idea is to “assign” each box to a target. We choose to send the box that is in row 5 (at (5,5)) to the easier target at (6,6) by a simple two‐push sequence (“right” then “down”), and then we work on the remaining box at (4,5) – sending it to (2,2) via a planned route (push “up” twice then “left” three times).\n\nBecause pushes require the player to “stand behind” the box (i.e. opposite the direction of the push), we must also include moves to reposition the player. Here is the overall strategy:\n\n───────────────────────────── \nBox B (at (5,5)) → Target T2 (6,6):\n1. First, get the player from the start (4,1) to the left of box B.

Push box B to the right:\n  • right (push: box from (5,5) to (5,6), player moves into (5,5))\n3. Next, the player must reposition to be above box B (now at (5,6)) in order to push it downward. A valid reposition route is:\n  • left (from (5,5) to (5,4))\n  • up  (5,4 → 4,4)\n  • up  (4,4 → 3,4)\n  • right (3,4 → 3,5)\n  • right (3,5 → 3,6)\n  • down (3,6 → 4,6)\n4. Now standing at (4,6) (directly above box B), push it down:\n  • down (push: box B from (5,6) to (6,6), player goes to (5,6))\nNow box B is on target (6,6).\n\n───────────────────────────── \nBox A (at (4,5)) → Target T1 (2,2):\nWe plan to push it “up” twice and then “left” three times. (Route: from (4,5) → (3,5) → (2,5) → (2,4) → (2,3) → (2,2))\n1. First, reposition to push up. To push a box upward, the player must stand below it. Box A is at (4,5), so the player must get to (5,5). From the current position (5,6):\n  • left (5,6 → 5,5)\n2. Then push the box upward:\n  • up (push: box A moves from (4,5) to (3,5), and player goes to (4,5))\n3. Push it up again:\n  • up (push: box A from (3,5) to (2,5), player moves from (4,5) to (3,5))\n4. Now the plan is to push the box left. To push left, the player must be to the box’s right. With box A now at (2,5), move the player to (2,6). A path from (3,5):\n  • right (3,5 → 3,6)\n  • up   (3,6 → 2,6)\n5. Now push left:\n  • left (push: box A from (2,5) to (2,4), player moves to (2,5))\n6. Push left again:\n  • left (push: box A from (2,4) to (2,3), player moves to (2,4))\n7. Finally push left:\n  • left (push: box A from (2,3) to target (2,2), player moves to (2,3))\n───────────────────────────── \nCombining all the moves sequentially, we obtain the following list:\n\n1. right   (from (4,1) to (4,2))\n2. right   (4,2 → 4,3)\n3. down    (4,3 → 5,3)\n4. right   (5,3 → 5,4)\n5. right   (push box B right: (5,5)→(5,6), player becomes (5,5))\n6. left    (player: (5,5) → (5,4))\n7. up     (5,4 → 4,4)\n8. up     (4,4 → 3,4)\n9. right   (3,4 → 3,5)\n10. right   (3,5 → 3,6)\n11. down   (3,6 → 4,6)\n12. down   (push box B down: (5,6)→(6,6), player becomes (5,6))\n13. left    (player: (5,6) → (5,5); now ready to push box A up)\n14. up     (push box A up: (4,5)→(3,5), player to (4,5))\n15. up     (push box A up: (3,5)→(2,5), player to (3,5))\n16. right   (player: (3,5) → (3,6))\n17. up     (player: (3,6) → (2,6); now to push left)\n18. left    (push box A left: (2,5)→(2,4), player to (2,5))\n19. left    (push box A left: (2,4)→(2,3), player to (2,4))\n20. left    (push box A left: (2,3)→(2,2), player to (2,3))\n\nAt the end, box B sits on T2 (6,6) and box A on T1 (2,2), so the puzzle is solved.\n\nNow, in the required output format, we list the moves (each as a lowercase string):\n\nAnswer: ['right','right','down','right','right','left','up','up','right','right','down','down','left','up','up','right','up','left','left','left']"],"prompt":"\n\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

In this solution the box originally at (4,3) is pushed right three times to its target (4,6), the box initially at (1,5) is pushed left four times until it reaches (1,1), and finally the box at (5,2) is maneuvered via a series of pushes (up, right, up, right, up) until it lands on (2,4). (Keep in mind that there are many valid solutions for Sokoban puzzles.) \n\nA step‐by‐step explanation with coordinates (rows,cols, with row0 at the top) is as follows:\n\nPhase 1 – Solve the middle box (B2):\n1. From the starting position at (3,3) go left to (3,2) and then down to (4,2) to get behind B2.\n2. From (4,2) push right:\n  • First “right”: pushes B2 from (4,3) to (4,4) (player goes to (4,3))\n  • Second “right”: pushes B2 from (4,4) to (4,5) (player goes to (4,4))\n  • Third “right”: pushes B2 from (4,5) to (4,6) – a target.\n\nPhase 2 – Solve the upper box (B1):\n1. Reposition the player from (4,5) to (1,6) by: up, right, up, up. (That is, (4,5)→(3,5)→(3,6)→(2,6)→(1,6).)\n2. With B1 sitting at (1,5), the player now at (1,6) can push it left:\n  • Push “left”: B1 goes to (1,4), player to (1,5)\n  • Push “left”: B1 goes to (1,3), player to (1,4)\n  • Push “left”: B1 goes to (1,2), player to (1,3)\n  • Push “left”: B1 goes to (1,1) (target), player to (1,2).\n\nPhase 3 – Solve the lower box (B3):\n1. From the current player position (1,2) go to (6,2) so that you can push B3 upward. A safe route is:\n  • right → (1,2)→(1,3)\n  • then down five times: (1,3)→(2,3)→(3,3)→(4,3)→(5,3)→(6,3)\n  • then left: (6,3)→(6,2).\n2. With B3 at (5,2) and the player at (6,2), push it “up” so that B3 moves to (4,2) and the player moves into (5,2).\n3. To push B3 right next, reposition so that you are to the left of it. From (5,2) go left to (5,1) then up to (4,1). Now push “right” so B3 goes from (4,2) to (4,3) and the player moves into (4,2).\n4. Now to push B3 upward, reposition the player below it. From (4,2) go down then right: (4,2)→(5,2) then (5,2)→(5,3). Now push “up” so B3 moves from (4,3) to (3,3) with the player going to (4,3).\n5. Next, to push B3 right from (3,3), reposition by going left then up. That puts the player at (3,2) (to the left of the box). Then push “right” so B3 moves to (3,4) and the player goes to (3,3).\n6. Finally, to push B3 up to its target, reposition so that you are below it. From (3,3) go down then right to reach (4,4). Then push “up” and B3 moves from (3,4) to (2,4) (target).\n\nBelow is the complete list of moves in order:\n\nMoves for B2 (middle box):\n  1. left\n  2. down\n  3. right\n  4. right\n  5. right\n\nReposition for B1 (upper box):\n  6. up\n  7. right\n  8. up\n  9. up\n\nMoves for B1:\n  10. left\n  11. left\n  12. left\n  13. left\n\nReposition for B3 (lower box):\n  14. right\n  15. down\n  16. down\n  17. down\n  18. down\n  19. down\n  20. left\n\nPush B3 upward:\n  21. up\n\nReposition to push B3 right:\n  22. left\n  23. up\n  24. right\n\nReposition to push B3 up:\n  25. down\n  26. right\n  27. up\n\nReposition to push B3 right:\n  28. left\n  29. up\n  30. right\n\nReposition to push B3 up (final push):\n  31. down\n  32. right\n  33. up\n\nThe final move list (with 33 moves) is as follows:\n\nAnswer: ['left', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'up', 'right', 'up', 'up', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'left', 'up', 'left', 'up', 'right', 'down', 'right', 'up', 'left', 'up', 'right', 'down', 'right', 'up']"],"prompt":"\n\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Coordinates (row, col) with 0-indexed rows:\n • Walls (X) form the boundary (rows 0 and 7, first and last columns) and some additional obstacles:\n  – Row 1: walls at (1,0), (1,2), (1,5), (1,7)\n  – Row 5: walls at (5,0), (5,1), (5,4), (5,7)\n2. The player (I) starts at (6,1).\n3. The single box (B) starts at (3,4).\n4. The target (T) is at (2,2).\n\nA promising plan is to push the box from (3,4) left twice and then push it upward into the target at (2,2). To do that:\n\nStep A. The player must reach the cell (3,5) (to the right of the box) to push it left. One possible route from (6,1) is:\n • (6,1) → (6,2): move \"right\"\n • (6,2) → (5,2): move \"up\"\n • (5,2) → (4,2): move \"up\"\n • (4,2) → (4,3): move \"right\"\n • (4,3) → (4,4): move \"right\"\n • (4,4) → (4,5): move \"right\"\n • (4,5) → (3,5): move \"up\"\n\nStep B. Now the player at (3,5) is properly positioned to push the box left:\n • From (3,5), move \"left\". This pushes the box from (3,4) to (3,3) and moves the player into (3,4).\n\nStep C. To push the box left once more (from (3,3) to (3,2)), the player (currently at (3,4)) just moves \"left\":\n • From (3,4), move \"left\". The box moves to (3,2) and the player to (3,3).\n\nStep D. The final push – to push the box upward from (3,2) to (2,2) – requires the player to be below the box at (4,2):\n • The player goes from (3,3) down to (4,3): move \"down\"\n • Then from (4,3) left to (4,2): move \"left\"\n • Finally, the player pushes up: from (4,2) move \"up\", pushing the box from (3,2) to (2,2) and landing in (3,2).\n\nWhen the box reaches (2,2), it is on the target and the puzzle is solved.\n\nThus the complete sequence of moves is:\n['right', 'up', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'up', 'left', 'left', 'down', 'left', 'up']\n\nAnswer: ['right','up','up','right','right','right','up','left','left','down','left','up']"],"prompt":"\n\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

From the starting position at (1,1) push the box at (2,1) (Box A) downward three times so that it moves from (2,1) → (3,1) → (4,1) → (5,1) (which is a target).  \n • Move 1: \"down\" (Player at (1,1) pushes Box A from (2,1) to (3,1); player ends at (2,1)).  \n • Move 2: \"down\" (Player at (2,1) pushes Box A from (3,1) to (4,1); player ends at (3,1)).  \n • Move 3: \"down\" (Player at (3,1) pushes Box A from (4,1) to (5,1); player ends at (4,1)).  \n\n2. Next, you need to handle the box at (4,5) (Box C) which should end at target (3,3). To push a box left you must be immediately to its right. So from your current position (4,1) you’ll want to go around since there is a wall at (4,2). One such route is to go up into row 3 then move right along row 3 until you reach column 6, and then move down into row 4.  \n • Move 4: \"up\" (from (4,1) to (3,1)).  \n • Moves 5–9: \"right\",\"right\",\"right\",\"right\",\"right\" (from (3,1) to (3,6) via (3,2),(3,3),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6)).  \n • Move 10: \"down\" (from (3,6) to (4,6)).  \nNow the player is at (4,6), immediately to the right of Box C (at (4,5)).  \n • Move 11: \"left\" to push Box C from (4,5) to (4,4) (player goes to (4,5)).  \nNow Box C is at (4,4) and the player, at (4,5), is still to its right.  \n • Move 12: \"left\" to push Box C from (4,4) to (4,3) (player ends at (4,4)).  \n\nBox C now still must be moved up into its target at (3,3). To push a box upward you must stand immediately below it. So from (4,4) the player must get to (5,3) (which is below Box C at (4,3)).  \n • Move 13: \"down\" (from (4,4) to (5,4)).  \n • Move 14: \"left\" (from (5,4) to (5,3)).  \nNow with the player at (5,3) and Box C at (4,3),  \n • Move 15: \"up\" to push Box C from (4,3) to (3,3) (player moves into (4,3)).  \nBox C is now sitting on its target at (3,3).\n\n3. Finally, deal with the box at (2,6) (Box B) which should go to target (5,6). A straightforward plan is to push it downward three times. To push down a box you must be immediately above it. So first, reposition the player so that you can get above Box B. Currently, the player is at (4,3). To avoid interfering with already solved boxes, take a route along open cells:\n • Move 16: \"right\" (from (4,3) to (4,4)).  \n • Move 17: \"up\" (from (4,4) to (3,4)).  \n • Move 18: \"up\" (from (3,4) to (2,4)).  \n • Move 19: \"up\" (from (2,4) to (1,4)).  \n • Move 20: \"right\" (from (1,4) to (1,5)).  \n • Move 21: \"right\" (from (1,5) to (1,6)).  \nNow the player is at (1,6) directly above Box B (which is at (2,6)).  \nThen push Box B downward three times:\n • Move 22: \"down\" (push Box B from (2,6) to (3,6); player goes to (2,6)).  \n • Move 23: \"down\" (push Box B from (3,6) to (4,6); player goes to (3,6)).  \n • Move 24: \"down\" (push Box B from (4,6) to (5,6); player goes to (4,6)).  \nBox B now sits on its target (5,6).\n\nAll boxes are now on their target areas.\n\nThe complete sequence of moves is:  \n[\"down\", \"down\", \"down\", \"up\", \"right\", \"right\", \"right\", \"right\", \"right\", \"down\", \"left\", \"left\", \"down\", \"left\", \"up\", \"right\", \"up\", \"up\", \"up\", \"right\", \"right\", \"down\", \"down\", \"down\"]\n\nAnswer: ['down','down','down','up','right','right','right','right','right','down','left','left','down','left','up','right','up','up','up','right','right','down','down','down']"],"prompt":"\n\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

(Remember: A push move means the player “steps” into the box and pushes it into the adjacent cell in that same direction. The player must be on the opposite side of the intended push direction.)\n\nPhase 1 – Solve Box A:\nThe goal is to push Box A (at (6,4)) left into (6,3). To do this the player must get to the right of the box – i.e. cell (6,5) – then move left.\n1. From starting (6,1), go up to (5,1):  \"up\"\n2. Move right to (5,2):  \"right\"\n3. Right to (5,3):  \"right\"\n4. Right to (5,4):  \"right\"\n5. Right to (5,5):  \"right\"\n6. Go down from (5,5) to (6,5):  \"down\"\n7. Now push left: standing at (6,5) move left; this pushes Box A from (6,4) to (6,3) (target):  \"left\"  \n  • After the push the player occupies (6,4).\n\nPhase 2 – Solve Box B:\nWe want Box B (currently at (4,4)) to eventually go to target (3,1). A good plan is to first push it left three times so that it goes from (4,4) to (4,1) and then push it upward into (3,1).\n\nReposition to prepare to push left:\n8. From (6,4) move right to (6,5):  \"right\"\n9. Go up from (6,5) to (5,5):  \"up\"\n10. Go up from (5,5) to (4,5):  \"up\"\nNow the player is at (4,5) – to the right of Box B.\n\nPush Box B left three times:\n11. Push left: from (4,5) move left; Box B goes from (4,4) to (4,3) and player lands at (4,4):  \"left\"\n12. With the player at (4,4) (to the right of Box B now at (4,3)), push left again; Box B goes to (4,2) and the player to (4,3):  \"left\"\n13. Push left a third time: player at (4,3) pushes left; Box B moves from (4,2) to (4,1) and the player moves to (4,2):  \"left\"\n\nNow reposition to push upward:\n14. From (4,2) move down to (5,2):  \"down\"\n15. Then move left to (5,1):  \"left\"\nNow standing at (5,1) (directly below Box B at (4,1)).\n\n16. Push up: moving up while pushing Box B; Box B moves from (4,1) to (3,1), and the player moves into (4,1):  \"up\"  \n  • Box B is now on target (3,1).\n\nPhase 3 – Solve Box C:\nBox C is at (4,6) and must go into target (5,6). For a down-push the player must come from above (cell (3,6)). We now reposition to (3,6).\n\nFrom current player position (4,1) take the route:\n17. Right from (4,1) to (4,2):  \"right\"\n18. Right to (4,3):  \"right\"\n19. Right to (4,4):  \"right\"\n20. Up from (4,4) to (3,4):  \"up\"\n21. Up from (3,4) to (2,4):  \"up\"\n22. Right from (2,4) to (2,5):  \"right\"\n23. Right from (2,5) to (2,6):  \"right\"\n24. Down from (2,6) to (3,6):  \"down\"\nNow, standing at (3,6), above Box C.\n\n25. Finally, push down: from (3,6) move down; this pushes Box C from (4,6) to (5,6) (target) and the player ends at (4,6):  \"down\"\n\nAll boxes are now on their respective target areas.\n\nBelow is the full move list as required.\n\nAnswer: ['up','right','right','right','right','down','left','right','up','up','left','left','left','down','left','up','right','right','right','up','up','right','right','down','down']"],"prompt":"\n\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

From the starting player position (7,5) go left to (7,4).\n2.

In this solution we assign the boxes as follows:\n• The box originally at (1,3) is pushed left twice so it ends on the target at (1,1).\n• The box originally at (3,5) is pushed four times left then one push down so it lands on the target at (4,1).\n• The box originally at (5,5) is pushed upward then left so it finishes on the target at (4,4).\n\nOne way to achieve that is to have the player (starting at (3,1)) follow this route:\n\nStep‐by‐step explanation:\n\n1. First, go to the box at (1,3) (BoxA). To prepare to push it left, the player must come at its right side. So from (3,1) take the route:\n  • up    (3,1) → (2,1)\n  • right  (2,1) → (2,2)\n  • right  (2,2) → (2,3)\n  • right  (2,3) → (2,4)\n  • up    (2,4) → (1,4)\n2. Now from (1,4) push BoxA left:\n  • left  (pushes the box from (1,3) → (1,2); player moves into (1,3))\n3. With the player now at (1,3) and standing immediately right of BoxA (at (1,2)), push it left a second time:\n  • left  (pushes the box from (1,2) → (1,1); player moves into (1,2))\n  BoxA is now on its target.\n\n4. Next, solve BoxB (initially at (3,5), destined for target (4,1)). The plan is to push it left four times and then push it downward. First, reposition the player so that he is to the right of BoxB. From (1,2) take a safe route avoiding obstacles:\n  • down  (from (1,2) to (2,2))\n  • right  (to (2,3))\n  • right  (to (2,4))\n  • right  (to (2,5))\n  • right  (to (2,6))\n  • down  (from (2,6) to (3,6))\n5. Now that the player is at (3,6) (to the right of BoxB), push it left repeatedly:\n  • left  (pushes BoxB from (3,5) → (3,4); player goes to (3,5))\n  • left  (pushes BoxB from (3,4) → (3,3); player goes to (3,4))\n  • left  (pushes BoxB from (3,3) → (3,2); player goes to (3,3))\n  • left  (pushes BoxB from (3,2) → (3,1); player goes to (3,2))\n6. To push BoxB down into (4,1), the player must come from above. So reposition:\n  • up    (from (3,2) to (2,2))\n  • left  (from (2,2) to (2,1))\n7. Now push down:\n  • down  (pushes BoxB from (3,1) → (4,1); player moves to (3,1))\n  BoxB is now on its target.\n\n8. Finally, solve BoxC (initially at (5,5), to be placed at target (4,4)). The plan is to push it upward then left. First reposition so that you can push it upward. For an upward push the player must get under BoxC. From (3,1) take a route to (6,5):\n  • right  (3,1) → (3,2)\n  • right  (3,2) → (3,3)\n  • down  (3,3) → (4,3)\n  • down  (4,3) → (5,3)\n  • down  (5,3) → (6,3)\n  • right  (6,3) → (6,4)\n  • right  (6,4) → (6,5)\n9. With the player at (6,5) (directly under BoxC, which is at (5,5)), push up:\n  • up  (pushes BoxC from (5,5) → (4,5); player moves to (5,5))\n10. To push BoxC left into target (4,4), the player must be to its right. Reposition:\n  • right  (from (5,5) to (5,6))\n  • up    (from (5,6) to (4,6))\n11. Finally, push left:\n  • left  (pushes BoxC from (4,5) → (4,4); player moves to (4,5))\n  BoxC is now on its target.\n\nAll boxes have reached target spots.

(Note that in Sokoban puzzles there may be several valid solutions.)\n\nFor clarity, here is one way to think about it. In our board the boxes start at:\n • BoxA at (4,2)\n • BoxB at (3,4)\n • BoxC at (3,5)\nand the targets are:\n • Target T1 at (2,6)\n • Target T2 at (6,7)\n • Target T3 at (7,2)\n\nIn the solution below we “assign” BoxC to target T1, BoxB to target T2 and BoxA to target T3. (There are other assignments, but this one works.)\n\nStep 1. Solve BoxC (initially at (3,5) → target T1 at (2,6)):\n • From the initial player position at (4,5) the player pushes BoxC upward. (When the player moves “up” from (4,5) to (3,5), the box is pushed from (3,5) into (2,5).)\n • Then the player repositions – first going left then up – to get to the left side of BoxC (now at (2,5)) so that a right‐push will slide it into the target T1 at (2,6).\n\nStep 2. Solve BoxB (initially at (3,4) → target T2 at (6,7)):\nThe plan is to “route” BoxB by first pushing it downward twice (so it goes from (3,4) → (4,4) and then to (5,4)). Then the idea is to push it to the right (twice, so that it goes to (5,5) then (5,6)). Next, instead of trying to push down from above (which won’t work because the only way into T2 is from the left), we reposition the player so that eventually BoxB is pushed from (6,6) to (6,7). In detail:\n • The player goes from (2,5) (after finishing BoxC) to (2,4) and then “down” to push BoxB from (3,4) to (4,4). (Player ends at (3,4).)\n • With a second “down” the box goes from (4,4) to (5,4) (player goes to (4,4)).\n • The player then travels (by “left” then “down”) so that he stands immediately to the left of BoxB. A “right” push brings BoxB from (5,4) to (5,5) (player goes into (5,4)). \n • Next, with the player still in position for a right‐push, a “right” pushes BoxB to (5,6) (player goes to (5,5)).\n • To push the box “down” from (5,6) to (6,6) the player must be immediately above it. So the player re‐routes by moving “up” then “right” (getting to (4,6)) and then a “down” push is done.\n • Finally, to push BoxB into T2 the player must get to the left of the box (BoxB is now at (6,6)). The player moves “left” then “down” to stand at (6,5) and a “right” push sends BoxB to (6,7).\n\nStep 3. Solve BoxA (initially at (4,2) → target T3 at (7,2)):\nBoxA is best pushed down three times. For each downward push the player must be in the cell immediately above the box.\n • Thus, the player walks from his current location (after finishing BoxB) back to a position above BoxA. One valid route is to go “up”, “up”, “left”, “left”, “up”, “left”, “left” arriving at (3,2).\n • Then three successive “down” pushes (each time the player – starting at (3,2) – pushes BoxA and occupies its old square) carry the box from (4,2) → (5,2) → (6,2) and finally into (7,2).\n\nBelow is the full move list (each move is one step – if a step pushes a box, the same command is used):\n\n 1. \"up\"       [Push BoxC: (3,5) → (2,5); player: (4,5) → (3,5)]\n 2. \"left\"     [Reposition: (3,5) → (3,4)]\n 3. \"up\"       [Reposition: (3,4) → (2,4)]\n 4. \"right\"    [Push BoxC: (2,5) → (2,6) → target T1; player: (2,4) → (2,5)]\n\n 5. \"left\"     [Reposition for BoxB: (2,5) → (2,4)]\n 6. \"down\"     [Push BoxB: (3,4) → (4,4); player: (2,4) → (3,4)]\n 7. \"down\"     [Push BoxB: (4,4) → (5,4); player: (3,4) → (4,4)]\n 8. \"left\"     [Reposition: (4,4) → (4,3)]\n 9. \"down\"     [Reposition: (4,3) → (5,3)]\n 10. \"right\"    [Push BoxB: (5,4) → (5,5); player: (5,3) → (5,4)]\n 11. \"right\"    [Push BoxB: (5,5) → (5,6); player: (5,4) → (5,5)]\n 12. \"up\"      [Reposition for next push: (5,5) → (4,5)]\n 13. \"right\"    [Reposition: (4,5) → (4,6)]\n 14. \"down\"    [Push BoxB: (5,6) → (6,6); player: (4,6) → (5,6)]\n 15. \"left\"     [Reposition: (5,6) → (5,5)]\n 16. \"down\"     [Reposition: (5,5) → (6,5)]\n 17. \"right\"    [Push BoxB: (6,6) → (6,7) → target T2; player: (6,5) → (6,6)]\n\n 18. \"up\"      [Now reposition to work on BoxA: (6,6) → (5,6)]\n 19. \"up\"      [Reposition: (5,6) → (4,6)]\n 20. \"left\"     [Reposition: (4,6) → (4,5)]\n 21. \"left\"     [Reposition: (4,5) → (4,4)]\n 22. \"up\"      [Reposition: (4,4) → (3,4)]\n 23. \"left\"     [Reposition: (3,4) → (3,3)]\n 24. \"left\"     [Reposition: (3,3) → (3,2)]\n 25. \"down\"     [Push BoxA: (4,2) → (5,2); player: (3,2) → (4,2)]\n 26. \"down\"     [Push BoxA: (5,2) → (6,2); player: (4,2) → (5,2)]\n 27. \"down\"     [Push BoxA: (6,2) → (7,2) → target T3; player: (5,2) → (6,2)]\n\nAll boxes have now been pushed onto their respective target squares.\n\nAnswer: ['up','left','up','right','left','down','down','left','down','right','right','up','right','down','left','down','right','up','up','left','left','up','left','left','down','down','down']"],"prompt":"\n\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The player (“I”) starts at (3,3). One natural assignment is:\n• Push BoxA into target (1,1)\n• Push BoxB into target (5,6)\n• Push BoxC into target (6,2)\n\nBelow is one valid solution. (Note: many correct solutions exist.)\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep 1. Send the player to push BoxC at (4,2) downward into target (6,2):\n1. From (3,3) move left to (3,2).  \n2. With the player at (3,2), move down. This pushes BoxC from (4,2) to (5,2) and moves the player to (4,2).  \n3. Move down again. Now BoxC is pushed from (5,2) to (6,2) (a target) and the player moves to (5,2).\n\n─────────────────────────────  \nStep 2. Reposition to push BoxA (at (1,3)) to target (1,1).  \nThe idea is to push BoxA left twice. For a leftward push, the player must be immediately to its right.\n\n4. From (5,2) go right to (5,3).  \n5.

In our setup the board rows (numbered 0–7 from top) have three boxes to be pushed onto three target cells. Initially the player (I) is at (3,2), with boxes at (1,2), (2,5) and (5,3) and targets at (1,6), (2,3) and (4,3).\n\nOne approach is to:\n\n1. First move to deal with the box on row 2 (at (2,5)) that should go left into the target at (2,3). To push it left twice, the player must first go to cell (2,6) (above, below, or beside as allowed) so that a left‐move will push the box from (2,5) into (2,4) and then again from (2,4) into (2,3).  \n • From the start at (3,2) go right four times to reach (3,6), then up to (2,6).  \n • Now, “left” will push the box from (2,5) → (2,4) (player moves into (2,5)); then another “left” pushes it from (2,4) → (2,3).\n\n2. Next, push the box at (5,3) upward onto its target at (4,3). To push a box upward the player must get below it.  \n • From the current position (2,4) (after finishing with the second box) go down four times to (6,4), then left to (6,3).  \n • Now an “up” move from (6,3) pushes the box at (5,3) upward so that it lands at (4,3). (After the push the player stands at (5,3).)\n\n3. Finally, take care of the remaining box at (1,2) that must be pushed right into the target at (1,6). To push a box to the right the player must stand immediately to its left.  \n • From the current position at (5,3), navigate to (1,1) (the cell left of the box) by going “right” then “up” as needed along an open path. One valid route is: from (5,3) go right to (5,4), then up twice to (3,4) while then shifting left from (3,4) to (3,3) and further left to (3,2), then up to (2,2), left to (2,1) and finally up to (1,1).  \n • Now push the box right four times. Each “right” move pushes the box one cell. In order the box moves: (1,2) → (1,3) then (1,3) → (1,4), then (1,4) → (1,5) and finally (1,5) → (1,6).\n\nThe complete move sequence is as follows:\n\nStep 1 (Push box at (2,5) into target (2,3)):\n • right, right, right, right, up, left, left\n\nStep 2 (Push box at (5,3) upward into target (4,3)):\n • down, down, down, down, left, up\n\nStep 3 (Reposition to push box at (1,2) to target (1,6)):\n • right, up, up, left, left, up, left, up\n\nStep 4 (Push the box right four times onto the target):\n • right, right, right, right\n\nThus, the full move list is:\n\n['right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'up', 'left', 'left', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'left', 'up', 'right', 'up', 'up', 'left', 'left', 'up', 'left', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']\n\nAnswer: ['right','right','right','right','up','left','left','down','down','down','down','left','up','right','up','up','left','left','up','left','up','right','right','right','right']"],"prompt":"\n\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

It is easiest to assign the box in Row3, col4 (“Box A”) to the nearby target in Row3, col5 and the other (“Box B” in Row4, col4) to the remaining target in Row2, col6.\n\nStep 1. Get the player to the left of Box A.\n• Start: player at (6,3). A straight “up” path works because rows 5, 4 and 3 are clear.\n Moves: up, up, up.\n Now player at (3,3).\n\nStep 2. Push Box A right into its target.\n• With the player at (3,3) standing immediately left of Box A (at (3,4)), moving “right” pushes Box A from (3,4) into (3,5) (a target).\n Move: right.\n After the push, the player occupies (3,4) and Box A is solved.\n\nStep 3. Reposition to push Box B.\nBox B is at (4,4) and must eventually go to target (2,6). A good plan is to move it upward then right.\n• To push Box B upward, the player must stand directly below it—that is, at (5,4). The player is now at (3,4) so we must take a detour that avoids the box.\n A safe route from (3,4): left to (3,3), then down to (4,3), then down to (5,3), and then right to (5,4).\n Moves: left, down, down, right.\n Now the player is at (5,4), underneath Box B.\n\nStep 4. Push Box B upward.\n• From (5,4), a move “up” pushes Box B from (4,4) to (3,4) and moves the player into (4,4).\n Move: up.\n Now Box B is at (3,4) and player at (4,4).\n\nStep 5. Continue pushing Box B upward.\n• Next, from (4,4) the player is directly below Box B (at (3,4)), so moving “up” again pushes Box B to (2,4) and moves the player to (3,4).\n Move: up.\n Now Box B is at (2,4) and player at (3,4).\n\nStep 6. Reposition to push Box B right.\n• To push a box right, the player must stand immediately to its left. Box B is at (2,4), so the player must get to (2,3). From (3,4) go left to (3,3) then up to (2,3).\n Moves: left, up.\n Player is now at (2,3).\n\nStep 7. Push Box B right twice to reach its target.\n• First “right” push: from (2,3), moving right pushes Box B from (2,4) to (2,5); the player moves into (2,4).\n Move: right.\n• Second “right” push: now with the player left of Box B (player at (2,4) and box at (2,5)), moving “right” pushes Box B from (2,5) to (2,6) (the target) and moves the player into (2,5).\n Move: right.\n\nAt this point both boxes are on targets:\n• Box A is at Row3, col5.\n• Box B is at Row2, col6.\n\nIn summary, the moves are as follows:\n\n 1. up   (from (6,3) to (5,3))\n 2. up   (from (5,3) to (4,3))\n 3. up   (from (4,3) to (3,3))\n 4. right  (push Box A from (3,4) to (3,5))\n 5. left   (start repositioning for Box B, from (3,4) to (3,3))\n 6. down   (to (4,3))\n 7. down   (to (5,3))\n 8. right   (to (5,4), beneath Box B)\n 9. up    (push Box B from (4,4) to (3,4))\n 10. up    (push Box B from (3,4) to (2,4))\n 11. left   (reposition from (3,4) to (3,3))\n 12. up    (from (3,3) to (2,3))\n 13. right   (push Box B from (2,4) to (2,5))\n 14. right   (push Box B from (2,5) to (2,6))\n\nThus the final solution is:\n\nAnswer: ['up','up','up','right','left','down','down','right','up','up','left','up','right','right']"],"prompt":"\n\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

One viable plan is to first push the box upward three times (so it climbs from (5,2) to (4,2), then to (3,2) and finally to (2,2)). Then, push it right and finally up into the target. (Be sure that before each push the player “gets into position” on the side opposite the push direction.) \n\nBelow is one step‑by‑step solution with the necessary “walking” moves for the player.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Pre‐position the player for the very first push:\n\nThe player starts at (6,6). To push the box upward from (5,2) the player must be directly below it—that is, at (6,2). A simple way is to move left four times along row 6:\n • left (from (6,6) → (6,5))\n • left (from (6,5) → (6,4))\n • left (from (6,4) → (6,3))\n • left (from (6,3) → (6,2))\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2.

Push “up” again.\n  – The box moves to (3,2) and the player moves into (4,2).\n\n• Push 3: With the player at (4,2) beneath the box at (3,2), push “up” again.\n  – The box moves to (2,2) and the player moves into (3,2).\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Reposition for the next push (a right‐push):\n\nTo push the box right (from (2,2) to (2,3)) the player must be immediately to its left—that is, at (2,1). The player is currently at (3,2).

Reposition for the final (up) push:\n\nThe final push (moving the box from (2,3) up into (1,3)) requires the player to be immediately below the box—that is, at (3,3).

The player (“I”) is at (row5, col3). The targets are at (row2, col2) and (row4, col6). We want one box to go into (2,2) and the other to (4,6).\n\nOne “good” solution goes as follows:\n\n1. Solve the first box (at (3,2)) by pushing it upward into the target at (2,2). To push up, the player must be below the box.\n • From the starting position (5,3), move up to (4,3) then left to (4,2).\n • Now the player at (4,2) moves up. The player “pushes” the box from (3,2) upward into (2,2) while the player occupies (3,2).\n\n2. Now solve the second box. Its goal is to get from (5,2) to the target at (4,6). Notice that row4 (which reads “XEEEEETX”) offers an open corridor from col1 to col6. So if we can get the box into row4 and then push it right several times, we finish.\n\n A. First, bring the second box upward from (5,2) to (4,2).  \n  – With the player at (3,2), take a detour to approach the box from below. For example, from (3,2) go: right, right, down, down, down, left, left. This brings the player to (6,2).  \n  – Then from (6,2) move up. This “push” makes the box (at (5,2)) move upward into (4,2) while the player lands at (5,2).\n\n B. Next reposition the player so that he is to the left of the box (now at (4,2)) in order to push it right along row4. A short route is: from (5,2) go right, then up, up, left, left, and finally down to reach (4,1).\n\n C. Now push the box right repeatedly along row4 until it reaches (4,6). With the player at (4,1) (immediately to the left of the box), perform:\n  – Push right: box goes from (4,2) to (4,3) and player moves to (4,2).  \n  – Push right: from player at (4,2) push the box (4,3 ➔ 4,4); player goes to (4,3).  \n  – Push right: with player at (4,3), push (4,4 ➔ 4,5); player goes to (4,4).  \n  – Push right: with player at (4,4), push (4,5 ➔ 4,6) into the target; player goes to (4,5).\n\nBy these moves, both boxes are finally placed on the targets.\n\nThe full move sequence is:\n\nStep 1 (Reaching behind box1 and pushing it up):\n • \"up\"    (from (5,3) to (4,3))\n • \"left\"   (from (4,3) to (4,2))\n • \"up\"    (push box at (3,2) upward so that it goes to (2,2); player lands at (3,2))\n\nStep 2 (Reposition to push box2 upward):\n • \"right\"  (from (3,2) to (3,3))\n • \"right\"  (from (3,3) to (3,4))\n • \"down\"   (to (4,4))\n • \"down\"   (to (5,4))\n • \"down\"   (to (6,4))\n • \"left\"   (to (6,3))\n • \"left\"   (to (6,2))\n\nStep 3 (Push box2 upward into row4):\n • \"up\"    (push the box from (5,2) up into (4,2); player goes to (5,2))\n\nStep 4 (Reposition to the left of the box so as to push it right):\n • \"right\"  (from (5,2) to (5,3))\n • \"up\"    (to (4,3))\n • \"up\"    (to (3,3))\n • \"left\"   (to (3,2))\n • \"left\"   (to (3,1))\n • \"down\"   (to (4,1))\n\nStep 5 (Push box2 right until it reaches (4,6)):\n • \"right\"  (push from (4,2) to (4,3); player -> (4,2))\n • \"right\"  (push from (4,3) to (4,4); player -> (4,3))\n • \"right\"  (push from (4,4) to (4,5); player -> (4,4))\n • \"right\"  (push from (4,5) to (4,6); player -> (4,5))\n\nThus, the complete list of moves (in order) is:\n\n['up', 'left', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'left', 'left', 'up', 'right', 'up', 'up', 'left', 'left', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']\n\nAnswer: ['up','left','up','right','right','down','down','down','left','left','up','right','up','up','left','left','down','right','right','right','right']"],"prompt":"\n\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Push the box at (4,4) upward into (3,4):  \nSince the player is initially at (5,4) (directly below (4,4)), a single “up” move pushes that box into (3,4) (which is one of the targets).  \n• Move: \"up\".  \nAfter this move, the player is at (4,4) and the box from (4,4) is now at (3,4).\n\nStep 2. Move the box at (5,2) into its target (4,2):  \nTo push a box upward, you must be immediately below it. Box B2 is at (5,2) and we want to push it upward into (4,2). So first reposition the player from (4,4) to (6,2). One viable path is:  \n• from (4,4) move \"down\" to (5,4),  \n• then \"left\" to (5,3),  \n• then \"down\" to (6,3),  \n• then \"left\" to (6,2).  \nNow from (6,2), a move \"up\" will push the box at (5,2) upward into (4,2).  \n• Move: \"up\".  \nAfter this push, the player lands at (5,2) and that box is now on its target.\n\nStep 3. Finally, move the box at (5,5) to (1,6):  \nWe plan to push it first to the right and then repeatedly upward.  \n• Reposition from (5,2) to a cell immediately to the left of the box at (5,5). A simple path: \"right\" (from (5,2) to (5,3)) then \"right\" (to (5,4)).  \nNow, from (5,4) (to the left of (5,5)) a \"right\" move will push the box at (5,5) to the right into (5,6) and bring the player to (5,5).  \n• Move: \"right\".  \nNow, to push the box upward, you must be directly below it. With the box now at (5,6) and the player at (5,5), reposition the player to (6,6). One way is:  \n• \"down\" from (5,5) to (6,5), then \"right\" from (6,5) to (6,6).  \nNow perform upward pushes. From (6,6), a move \"up\" pushes the box from (5,6) to (4,6) (player goes to (5,6)). Then from that new position, keeping the box directly above:  \n• another \"up\" pushes it from (4,6) to (3,6) (player goes to (4,6)),  \n• a third \"up\" pushes it from (3,6) to (2,6) (player goes to (3,6)),  \n• and a fourth \"up\" pushes it from (2,6) to (1,6) (player goes to (2,6)).  \nThat places the last box on its target at (1,6).\n\nPutting it all together, the sequence of moves is:\n1. \"up\"  \n2. \"down\"  \n3. \"left\"  \n4. \"down\"  \n5. \"left\"  \n6. \"up\"  \n7. \"right\"  \n8. \"right\"  \n9. \"right\"  \n10. \"down\"  \n11. \"right\"  \n12. \"up\"  \n13. \"up\"  \n14. \"up\"  \n15. \"up\"  \n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: ['up','down','left','down','left','up','right','right','right','down','right','up','up','up','up']"],"prompt":"\n\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.
