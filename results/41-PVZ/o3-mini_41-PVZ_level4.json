With 70 sun available this turn, the Sunflower costs 50 sun and will generate an additional 10 sun next turn.

Because row 3 lacks an attacking plant, that zombie will slowly batter the Wall‐nut. While we’d like to “counter‐fire” in row 3, a Peashooter would cost 100 sun – just slightly more than our available funds. By contrast, a Sunflower costs only 50 sun. Even though it won’t delay the danger in row 3 immediately, investing in extra sun can help us afford a stronger defensive plant on a future turn.\n\nSince rows 0, 2, and 4 already have key plants (row 0 has a Peashooter applying damage to its zombie, and the sunflowers in rows 0, 2, and 4 already support our economy), row 1 is safe and currently empty except for a Sunflower at (1,0). Thus, planting a Sunflower at (1,1) uses 50 sun (leaving us with 45) and boosts our sun production for upcoming turns. This extra economy should help us eventually afford a Peashooter in row 3 or another stronger plant once we have 100 sun or more.\n\nSo, the move is to plant a Sunflower (X) in row 1, column 1.","Based on the board, it looks like the danger is currently coming in row3 (and row0 already has its own peashooter). Row3 has a zombie already – held in place by the wall-nut at column 4 – but it isn’t getting any extra firepower. With 130 sun available and a peashooter costing 100 sun, we can add an extra source of damage to help hasten the zombie’s defeat in that row.\n\nA good move is to plant a Peashooter (W) in row3 in column3. Placing it immediately to the left of the blocking wall‐nut (which is at col4) means it can start attacking the zombie sooner.\n\nThus, the input would be:\nAnswer: W 3 3","Answer: W 2 5\n\nI'm choosing to plant a Peashooter (W) in row 2, column 5. This placement helps add offensive coverage to row 2 where a Roadblock zombie (R) is approaching in column 6. With our current 115 sun, spending 100 on a Peashooter leaves enough sun for future turns. The Peashooter will begin chipping away at the 8‐HP Roadblock, hopefully slowing its progress until further plants or sun generation can bolster our defense.\n\nLet’s see how the situation unfolds!","Answer: W 4 4\n\nHere’s the reasoning: With 100 sun available at turn 12, you have exactly enough to plant a Peashooter (W) – a 100‑sun plant that deals damage each turn to the first zombie in its row. In the current battlefield, row4 only has a Sunflower at column0 while a Roadblock zombie (R) lurks in column5. By placing a Peashooter at row4, column4, you create a frontline stopper that forces the zombie to engage your plant before reaching the vital sunflower. This helps slow the zombie’s advance and gives your defenses more time to reduce its HP.","I'll plant a Wall‐nut in row 3, column 4. That way the regular zombie (N) already present in row 3 will have to attack the sturdy 10‐HP wall‐nut instead of attacking your 2‐HP peashooter at (3,3), giving your shooter time to damage it. \n\nAnswer: J 3 4","Answer: W 2 4","Answer: W 2 3\n\nAnalysis:\nLooking at the board at turn 15 we see that row 2 already has a peashooter at column 4 that is “sharing” its cell with a Roadblock Zombie (R). Since zombies only attack the rightmost (i.e. the first encountered) plant in their row, that peashooter is under immediate threat and will likely get eliminated quickly (it only has 2 HP, and the zombie does 1 damage per turn). In contrast, row 4’s zombie (at column 4) isn’t yet in collision with any plant (its only plant is a Sunflower in column 0, which is too far to deter it).\n\nBy spending 100 sun (out of the available 105) to plant an extra Peashooter (W) on row 2 at column 3 – an empty cell – you add a secondary shooter to that row. While the blocking plant (at col 4) may still be attacked by the zombie, both shooters will fire each turn at the “first” zombie in row 2. This extra damage–even if it only delays the zombie’s progress–can help decrease its HP faster than if it were only facing a single Peashooter. In upcoming turns this increased damage output should help you better deal with the threat on row 2, and use your remaining sun (and the guaranteed sun income) to shore up row 4 in subsequent turns.\n\nThus the recommended move is to plant a Peashooter in row 2, column 3.","Answer: J 4 2\n\nAnalysis:\nAt turn 16 you have 90 sun, and with your available options only the 50‑cost Sunflower (X) or Wall‑nut (J) are affordable. Looking at the board, the zombie on row4 is already at column 3—this is the most immediate threat because it’s only three steps from your sunflower at column 0. By planting a Wall‑nut (with its 10 HP) at row4, column 2 (the cell directly left of the zombie), you force the zombie to pause and attack your new Wall‑nut rather than advancing and reaching your sunflower quickly. This delay can give you extra turns to build up your sun and prepare additional defenses.\n\nThus, the move is to plant a Wall‑nut at 4 2.","Answer: W 4 1","Answer: W 1 2","Answer: X 0 2","Answer: J 2 2;X 0 5","Answer: H 1 3","Answer: W 3 2","Answer: W 1 4","Answer: W 3 5\n\nAnalysis:\nAt turn 24, with 135 sun available we want an immediate boost in offensive firepower in the row that’s under heavy zombie pressure. Row3 currently has two Peashooters (W) in columns 2 and 3 shooting at a group of zombies (a Bucket Zombie “B” with 12 HP and a Regular Zombie “N”) that are positioned at column 4 in front of a Wall‐nut (J) blocking their path. Although the Wall‐nut is absorbing damage, the Bucket Zombie in particular takes several turns to wear it down and its higher health means it can eventually push through if not pulled down faster.\n\nBy planting an extra Peashooter in row3 (for example in column 5, which is empty), you increase the lane’s DPS. This extra unit helps to further chip away at the zombies’ health before they overwhelm the barrier. At 100 sun the Peashooter is the best defensive investment at this moment given the sun available; spending the remaining sun on a sunflower or a Torch Stump isn’t optimal since immediate damage is needed and 35 sun would be insufficient for any additional planting.\n\nThus, the move is to plant a Peashooter (W) at row 3, column 5.","Answer: H 1 5\n\nI’m choosing to plant a Torch Stump (H) in row 1, column 5. This move boosts the damage of the existing peashooter in row 1 at column 4 from 1 to 2 damage per turn. With the Regular Zombie (N) already in row 1 at column 1 (which currently has 4 HP) advancing toward the leftmost sunflower, the extra damage should help eliminate it more quickly before it can destroy our valuable sun-producing plant. \n\nThis decision uses 125 of our 140 sun, leaving a small reserve while addressing an immediate threat.","I'll spend sun on a defensive move on row4. Notice that row4 already has two zombies—a fast‐hitting High‐Attack Zombie (I) in column 2 and a Roadblock Zombie (R) in column 6. The pea shooter in row4 (at column1) will target the furthest‐right zombie (the R in column6), so nothing is stopping the dangerous I from eventually reaching the left and damaging our key pea shooter. \n\nSince we have 110 sun and Wall‑nuts (J) cost 50 (and have 10 HP), a good idea is to put a Wall‑nut into row4 to block the advance of the high‐attack zombie. Even though a Wall‑nut in a cell that already contains a zombie is allowed (zombies and plants can coexist), placing J at row4 column2 will force the I zombie to attack that barrier instead of immediately moving into the pea shooter’s cell. That extra delay can be crucial for our defense.\n\nThus I’ll plant a Wall‑nut (J)","Answer: H 4 2; X 3 0\n\nI’ve chosen to spend 125 sun to plant a Torch Stump (H) at row 4, column 2. This will buff the existing row‐4 Peashooter at (4,1) by increasing its damage by +1—hopefully helping it, even if temporarily, to deal with the dangerous High‐Attack zombie (I) sharing its cell. In addition, for future sun income and long‐term economy (especially as zombie waves soon grow stronger), I am planting a Sunflower (X) at row 3, column 0, which is a safe spot on the left. \n\nThis combined move costs 125 + 50 = 175 sun (well within the available 205 sun) and prepares both a short‑term defensive boost in row 4 and improved sun production going forward.","Answer: W 4 1\n\nI decided to plant a Peashooter (W) at row 4, column 1. Here’s my reasoning:\n\n• Row 4 is under immediate pressure. A High‐Attack Zombie (I) is already in column 1 and deals heavy damage; if left unchecked it will soon destroy our left‑side plants (like the sunflower in column 0).  \n• Placing a Peashooter there provides extra firepower immediately. In addition, note that row 4 already has a Torch Stump (H) in column 2. A Torch Stump boosts the damage of the plant immediately to its left—so our newly planted Peashooter will get a +1 damage boost (increasing its damage from 1 to 2) which should help in taking down that dangerous high‑attack zombie even faster.  \n• The cost is 100 sun, which leaves us with 35 sun. While that isn’t enough for a second planting this turn, it prioritizes immediate defense over long‑term sun generation.\n\nThus, the move is: \"Answer: W 4 1\"","行和列必须为整数。","Answer: W 2 4;W 3 1\n\nAnalysis:\n• In row2 the only existing plants (sunflowers and a wall‐nut) don’t shoot, while zombies (a Roadblock and a Bucket) are already in the row. Planting a Peashooter (W) at column 4 will add extra shooting power to whittle down the Roadblock (which, as the leftmost zombie, is shielding the Bucket), eventually letting both be targeted.\n• In row3 the two Peashooters (in columns 2 and 5) are already under pressure from zombies in their column. Adding another Peashooter at column 1 (to the left of the zombies in col2) reinforces the line of defense, increasing the cumulative damage on the advancing zombies.\n• The total sun cost is 100 + 100 = 200 sun, leaving some sun in reserve for future turns.\n\nThese placements help bolster defense just in time for the new zombie spawn expected next turn.","Answer: W 4 6\n\nExplanation:\nRow4 is currently without any attacking plant even though zombies are already dangerously close (note the High‐Attack Zombie “I” at column0 and the Roadblock “R” in the same row). By spending 100 sun to plant a Peashooter (W) in an empty cell (column6 of row4), you add offensive firepower in that row. The new Peashooter will damage the leftmost zombie each turn and help to slow (and eventually eliminate) the advancing threat. (This move uses 100 sun out of 135, leaving 35 sun—insufficient for an additional planting action this turn.)"],"prompt":"\nIn the following, you are required to participate in a simplified version of the Plants vs. Zombies game.

This position is right before the advancing zombies—especially the Roadblock zombie (which appears in row 0 near the far‐right) that poses a stronger threat with its 8 HP. By placing the Peashooter in the empty cell at (0,4), you’ll add extra firepower in that row. Its shots will help reduce the zombie’s HP before it can overcome the wall-nut at (0,3) or reach your other defenses, giving you a better chance on turn 16.","Answer: X 3 1\n\nExplanation:\nWith only 75 sun available this turn, you can only afford one plant. Although row0 already has zombies attacking (appearing in cells with the pea shooter and wall‐nut), it’s generally wise to invest in long‐term sun production early on. Adding another Sunflower (X), particularly on an unoccupied and safe row such as row3, helps increase your sun income for upcoming turns. Placing the sunflower at row3 column1 avoids interfering with your existing defenses while boosting your economy.","Answer: W 4 4","Answer: X 3 2","Answer: W 0 1","Answer: H 0 2","Answer: X 3 3;J 4 3","Answer: W 0 5\n\nAnalysis:\n• Row0 is under heavy pressure – zombies are already present in two cells (col3 and col4). Although there is a Wall‐nut at col3 and a Torch Stump at col2 (which boosts the nearby Peashooter’s damage), it seems that extra offensive firepower is needed against the mixed Roadblock and High‐Attack threats.\n• Planting a Peashooter (“W” costs 100 sun, leaving a little reserve from the current 110 sun) in an empty cell (col5) of row0 adds an extra shooter. Its shots will pile on the damage already coming from the enhanced Peashooter (from col1, receiving the Torch Stump boost from col2) so that the front zombie (in col3) can be taken down faster.\n• While planting additional Sunflowers or Wall‐nuts are viable in other circumstances, the immediate risk on row0 makes an extra Peashooter the most urgent action this turn.\n\nThus, the move is to plant a Peashooter (W) at row 0, column 5.","Answer: X 1 4\n\nI'll plant a Sunflower in row 1, column 4. That costs 50 sun (leaving 65), and though the battle is heating up in rows 0, 2, and 4, investing in additional sun production now will help me afford more costly—and defensive or offensive—plants in later turns.","I'll use a simple strategy this turn. Looking closely at the board, row4 seems a bit vulnerable. There’s a lone zombie (N) in row4 at column 4 and the only plant protecting that lane is the Wall‐nut (J) at col3 (with 10 HP). That wall‐nut will eventually take repeated hits from the zombie, and without additional firepower, the threat may break through. In contrast, row0 already has a boosted Peashooter (W in col1 with the Torch Stump to its right) fending off three zombies.\n\nTo help row4 hold longer, I’m going to plant a Peashooter (W) in row4 at column 1. By placing it to the left of the Wall‐nut, it can start dealing damage as soon as the zombie appears (and even if the wall‐nut is later destroyed, the shooter will have been positioned to attack as the zombie advances). The cost is 100 sun, which leaves us with enough for future turns.\n\nAnswer: W 4 1","Answer: W 3 4;J 3 5\n\nI've decided to bolster row3 because it currently has zombies in column 6 and only non‐attacking sunflowers from columns 0–3. Placing a Peashooter (W) at row3 column4 gives us a shooter to start chipping away at those advancing zombies, while adding a Wall-nut (J) at row3 column5 creates a barrier to slow their approach, buying time for our new shooter (and the other plants) to deal damage. This uses 100 + 50 = 150 sun, leaving us with some reserve sun for future turns.","Answer: W 1 6;X 4 2","Answer: W 0 2\n\nI'm choosing to plant a Peashooter (W) in row 0, column 2. Here’s the reasoning:\n\n• In row 0 the only existing plant is a Sunflower at column 0, and there’s an aggressive group of zombies (N, R, I) already in column 1. Without an extra attacker, that lone sunflower will soon be overwhelmed.\n\n• A Peashooter added in an empty cell (here chosen as col 2) will immediately contribute another 1 damage per turn to the “first zombie” in row 0. Combined with the existing Peashooter in col 5, row 0 will then dish out 2 damage per turn—helping to take down the zombie group faster before they can reach and damage the Sunflower at col 0.\n\n• At 135 sun, spending 100 on a Peashooter is both efficient and timely for defense. With the remaining 35 sun you won’t be able to afford a more-expensive option (like a Torch Stump, which costs 125, or even another Sunflower at 50) without sacrificing immediate protection.\n\nThis move should help hold off the immediate threat in row 0 as you look ahead to future turns.","I recommend using 100 sun right away to improve your firepower in a row that’s already under heavy pressure—and then, if possible, getting a sunflower to help build your economy. For example, in row 0 you already have a sunflower at column 0 that is being assailed by both a Roadblock (R) and a High‐Attack (I) zombie; although that sunflower produces extra sun, it’s very fragile (only 2 HP) and the extra shooting in the row will help take the hit faster. Placing a Peashooter (W) in row 0 at the empty column 1 not only adds another source of damage on that row (remember that all Peashooters in the same row shoot the “first” zombie each turn) but also uses a moderate 100 sun. With 160 sun available this turn, you still have 60 sun left. To use most of your sun wisely and bolster sun income (which is always helpful as the zombie waves get tougher), you can then plant a Sunflower (X) in a safe row—say, row 4 at column 4 (an empty cell) where no zombies are currently present. That costs 50 sun, bringing your total use to 150 sun and leaving you with a little spare.\n\nSo one good answer move is:\n\nAnswer: W 0 1;X 4 4\n\nThis places a new Peashooter at row 0, column 1 (to help eliminate the dangerous zombies already on that row) and a Sunflower at row 4, column 4 (to boost your sun production for future turns).\n\nGood luck for Turn 29!","Answer: H 0 6"],"prompt":"\nIn the following, you are required to participate in a simplified version of the Plants vs. Zombies game.

This additional sunflower—placed in a row already safe for now—will help us afford stronger (and more expensive) offensive plants (like the Peashooter) in the near future when our resources allow.\n\nFeel free to provide your next move when you’re ready!","Answer: W 1 0\n\nI'll plant a Peashooter (W) on row 1, column 0. This places an offensive unit in the row with an advancing zombie (currently at row 1, column 4) so that it can start denting the enemy’s 4‑HP Regular Zombie before it reaches the wall‐nut further down the lane. With 105 sun available, spending 100 sun for the Peashooter leaves a small remainder while bolstering our defense on turn 9.","Answer: X 4 1","Based on the current board and our limited sun (95), our most urgent concern is the lone zombie in row2, which is advancing from column 6 toward our only (non‐offensive) sunflower in that row. Since we can’t afford a Peashooter (100 sun) just yet and need to delay that zombie’s progress, one effective option is to plant a Wall‐nut (J, cost 50 sun) as a blocker in row2. Placing it at column 5 ensures the zombie (currently at column 6) is forced to stop and attack the Wall‐nut instead of sprinting unimpeded toward our sunflowers. This gives us extra time to build up sun and eventually add an offensive plant in row2. \n\nPlanting J in row2 at column 5 will cost 50 sun (leaving us with 45 sun for now), which is acceptable given the pressing need to delay the zombie.\n\nThus, the move for Turn 11 is:\n\nAnswer: J 2 5","Answer: W 3 4\n\nI recommend placing a Peashooter (W) in row 3 column 4. This cell is currently empty and placing a shooter there will target the zombies currently clustered in row 3 (the cell at column 5 already has a Wall-nut with zombies “JNR”) before they get too close. It costs 100 sun, which leaves you with 20 sun remaining, and will give your defense a boost in a row facing a potentially dangerous Roadblock zombie.","Answer: X 0 2\n\nI recommend placing an additional Sunflower on row 0, column 2. At turn 13 you have 95 sun, and spending 50 on a Sunflower will leave you with enough resources to generate even more sun next turn (especially with the extra 10 sun per turn from your existing Sunflowers). Since the immediate zombie threats are in rows 2 and 3, investing in economy now should help you better afford stronger defenses in future turns.","Answer: W 2 4\n\nI decided to add a Peashooter in row 2 at column 4. Currently row 2 has a Sunflower at column 0 and an existing Wall-nut (J) in column 5 that’s already blocking the zombie (N). However, that blocking plant can only soak so much damage, and because there isn’t any shooter in row 2, the zombie remains unchallenged long‐term. By planting a Peashooter (W) at (row 2, column 4), it will be directly to the left of the zombie’s cell and immediately begin dealing damage (1 damage per turn) to the first zombie in that row. This extra firepower should help reduce the zombie’s HP before it can take down the Wall-nut, improving our defense overall while keeping within our 130 sun budget.","Answer: J 3 3\n\nExplanation: With 115 sun available on turn 15, our most urgent need is to slow down the advancing zombies—in particular in row 3, where a Roadblock and a Regular Zombie are already present in columns 4 and 5, threatening our Peashooter in that row. Planting a Wall‐nut (J) in row3, column3 (an empty cell directly in front of the zombies) will serve as a solid barrier (10 HP) to delay their progress and protect our key attacking plant. This move costs 50 sun, leaving 65 sun for future turns, and helps keep our defense intact as the game progresses.","Answer: H 3 5\n\nI’d recommend using your 125 sun to plant a Torch Stump in row 3, column 5. This placement will boost the damage output of the peashooter at row 3, column 4 (which is already dealing 1 damage per turn) to 2 damage per turn. With zombies already present in row 3 (including a Roadblock Zombie with 8 HP and a Regular Zombie with 4 HP in that cell, plus another Regular Zombie further right), this extra damage can help take them down a bit faster before they breach your defenses. \n\nYou’ll have 25 sun remaining after this—a modest balance until more sun is generated (remember, at least 25 sun is automatically added each turn).","Answer: W 3 4","Answer: X 4 2","Based on the current board and situation, one concern is that the zombies in row3 (a Roadblock zombie in column 4 and a Regular Zombie in column 5) are already testing the only barrier—a 10‐HP Wall‐nut in column 3. With turn 20 just around the corner (when an extra zombie will spawn and new spawns become stronger), it makes sense to shore up row3 with some extra firepower.\n\nA Peashooter (W) in row3 would attack the zombies regardless of its position, and even though its shots come “through” the shielding Wall‐nut (which is taking the brunt of the attacks), the extra damage can help reduce the threat as soon as the Wall‐nut’s HP comes into question. Placing the W in an empty cell at the right end (column 6) puts it safely out of harm’s way while still being effective on its row.\n\nThe cost of a Peashooter is 100 sun; with 140 sun available, spending 100 sun leaves 40 sun remaining, which isn’t enough for another plant this turn. This is a reasonable trade‐off given the immediate need to help row3 withstand looming pressure.\n\nThus, a good move is:\n\nAnswer: W 3 6","Answer: W 3 2\n\nRationale:\n• Row3 is facing multiple zombies—a Roadblock zombie paired with a Wall‑nut at col3 and an additional Regular zombie at col4.\n• The only attacking plant in that row is the peashooter at col6, which is positioned very far to the right.\n• Adding a Peashooter (W) at row3, column2 (an empty cell) will start dealing damage sooner each turn to the zombie in that lane.\n• This move costs 100 sun, which is affordable given the available 135 sun, leaving some extra sun for future turns.\n\nGood luck!","Answer: H 2 5","Answer: W 2 4","Answer: J 4 3\n\nAnalyzing the situation at Turn 23 with 95 sun available, we can only afford a 50‐sun plant (or one sunflower or wall‐nut). In row 4 the High-Attack Zombie (I) at column 4 poses an immediate threat to the sunflowers in columns 0–2 because, if it advances, its 3 damage will quickly wipe out these vulnerable 2‑HP plants. By placing a Wall‑nut (J) at row 4, column 3 (an empty cell), you create a sturdy barrier (10 HP) that will force the high‐attack zombie to stop and attack the wall‑nut first instead of reaching the sun-producing sunflowers. This defensive reinforcement should help delay the zombie’s progress while you continue building up your resources.\n\nThus, the move is:\n\nAnswer: J 4 3","Answer: J 2 3; X 1 2\n\nExplanation:\n• With 140 sun available, it’s wise to bolster defense where zombies are advancing. In row2 the only plant is a weak Sunflower at column 0 while zombies (N at col4 and R at col5) draw nearer. Placing a Wall-nut (“J”) at row2, column 3 will serve as a sturdy blocker (10 HP) to delay their advance.\n• In addition, planting a Sunflower (“X”) in row1 (which is currently free and not under immediate attack) costs 50 sun and will add an extra 10 sun per turn for future resource needs.\n• The two moves cost 50 + 50 = 100 sun, leaving you with 40 sun for the turn, and help shore up both your defense and your economy.","Based on the current board and our limited sun (145 sun on turn 25), we need to shore up firepower in the row(s) where zombies are already present. Note that row2 currently has only a Sunflower at col0 while its zombie threat appears in col3–col4 (with a Wall‑nut covering already, but it still gets hit each turn and will eventually give way). By planting an extra Peashooter (W, cost 100 sun) in row2 on an empty cell left of the oncoming zombies (for example, at row2 col1), we can help focus fire on the lead zombie.\n\nUsing 100 sun for the Peashooter leaves 45 sun, which isn’t enough for any other plant (the cheapest being a Sunflower for 50 sun).\n\nThus a recommended move is:\n\nAnswer: W 2 1","Answer: W 0 5","Answer: H 1 1\n\nAnalysis:\nAt turn 27 with 155 sun available, our board shows that row1 has a lone Peashooter at column0 and a pair of zombies (a Regular and a High‐Attack Zombie) currently in column5. Although the wall‐nuts in columns 3 and 4 are blocking further progress temporarily, the zombies are steadily pressing forward. Boosting the row1 shooter can help inflict additional damage on these advancing threats before the wall‐nuts give out.\n\nThe Torch Stump (H) costs 125 sun and must be placed immediately to the right of a plant to boost its damage by +1. Row1’s column1 is open and directly to the right of the Peashooter at column0. Planting the Torch Stump there will increase that shooter’s damage from 1 to 2 per turn. This extra firepower should help clear the zombies in row1 faster, ensuring they are eliminated before they can tear through the defensive wall‐nuts.\n\nThis move uses 125 sun, leaving 30 sun unspent (which is below the cost of any further plant), but it maximizes our limited resources by raising our offensive output in a row that is under immediate pressure.\n\nThus, the recommended move is: H in row1, column1.","Answer: H 3 3\n\nI’m choosing to plant a Torch Stump (H) in row 3, column 3. In row 3 the cell at column 2 already holds a Peashooter (W) that is currently fending off two zombies (a Roadblock and a Regular zombie). By placing a Torch Stump immediately to its right (even though that cell already has a zombie, only a plant is not yet present), the Torch Stump will buff the existing Peashooter—raising its damage from 1 to 2 per turn—which should help it eliminate the dangerous zombies more quickly. This offensive boost appears most urgent in row 3 given the dual zombie threat, and the cost of 125 sun fits within our current sun (135).","Answer: W 0 3\n\nI’ve decided to plant a Peashooter (W) in row 0, column 3. Although row 4 is in danger from the high‐attack zombie, with our current 115 sun our affordable and best immediate defensive move is to add shooting support to row 0—helping to chip away at the tough Bucket Zombie (B) in that lane. This uses 100 sun (leaving 15 sun), and while row 4’s situation remains precarious (since its sunflowers don’t shoot and the zombie in their cell is dangerous), we may be able to build up extra sun on subsequent turns to take stronger actions.","Answer: W 4 3\n\nI'm choosing to plant a Peashooter (W) in row 4, column 3. Row4 already has two Sunflowers (X) in columns 0 and 1, but the high‐attack zombie (I) sitting in column 2 is a real threat—it can deal 3 damage per turn and would quickly take out those fragile sunflowers before they can help defend (or produce sun). By adding a Peashooter to row4 (even though it’s to the right of the zombie), its “always‐shoot” ability means it will target the first zombie found in its row, which is our high‐attack zombie. This extra source of damage can help chip away at the 6‑HP zombie before it gets too close. The move costs 100 sun, leaving us with 20 sun for now, which is acceptable given the immediate need for firepower in that lane.","Answer: W 3 0\n\nI recommend placing a Peashooter (“W”) in row 3, column 0. Row 3 is the only line that currently has no own shooting plant, even though several zombies are already present there. A Peashooter placed at the leftmost cell will immediately begin attacking the leading zombie in that row (the one originally at col1) during the plant‐attack phase. Although its 2 HP means it won’t last very long if overwhelmed, its attack may stall the left‐advancing zombies enough (especially given that they only do 1 damage per turn, except for the high‐attack ones) while you build up your resources for later turns. Since the Peashooter costs 100 sun, it fits well within your current sun total of 115.\n\nThus, the move is: Answer: W 3 0","Answer: W 0 4\n\nI'm choosing to spend 100 sun on a Peashooter in row 0, column 4. Currently the row‐0 bucket zombie (B) has a lot of HP (12) and is already engaged with the Peashooter at col 3. Adding another shooter in row 0 should ramp up the damage against that tough foe and help eliminate it faster. This offensive move uses most of our 110 sun while bolstering our firepower on a row where slowing the bucket zombie’s progress is critical.","Answer: X 2 2"],"prompt":"\nIn the following, you are required to participate in a simplified version of the Plants vs. Zombies game.

Given our current resources (105 sun) and the immediate threat on row0, planting a Peashooter (W) to the right of the sunflower but left of the zombie will quickly start attacking the zombie. Placing it at col3 puts it immediately to the left of the zombie at col4, so it will be the first attacker in the row. This should help slow or eliminate the zombie before it can reach and damage your Sunflower.","Answer: W 0 1","Answer: J 1 5\n\nAnalysis:\nAt turn 21 with 95 sun available, the only affordable plants are the 50‐sun options: the Sunflower (X) and the Wall‑nut (J). Reviewing the board shows that row 1 is under immediate threat—a high‐attack zombie (I) is already in cell (1,6) and is paired with a wall‑nut. However, row 1 lacks an offensive plant (a Peashooter isn’t affordable) so its primary survival depends on stalling the zombie. By placing an extra Wall‑nut (J) in the cell immediately to the left (cell (1,5)), you add another layer of defense. When the zombie in (1,6) eventually finishes its current wall‑nut, it will have to attack the new one in (1,5), buying you extra time to build up your sun economy (with Sunflowers already generating extra sun) so that you may afford stronger, offensive plants on later turns.\n\nThus, planting a Wall‑nut in row 1 column 5 is the best immediate defensive move.","Answer: W 1 1\n\nAnalysis:\nOn turn 22 with 140 sun available we must face immediate threats. Notably, row 1 already hosts a wall‐nut at column 5 that is partially blocking a dangerous high‐attack zombie (I) at column 6. That zombie inflicts 3 damage per turn and, with 6 HP, can quickly overwhelm its current defender. By adding a new Peashooter (W) costing 100 sun in row 1 at column 1 (an empty cell), we secure extra firepower in that row. The new W will target the first zombie (the high‐attack I) on the following turn, helping reduce its HP before it breaches further into your defense. This proactive measure helps fortify your board and extend your survival on this crucial turn.\n\nThus, the suggested move is: W 1 1","Answer: W 2 3\n\nI’ve chosen to plant a Peashooter (W) in row 2, column 3. Given the current board and the affordable sun (135), row 2—with its existing Peashooter at column 2 blocking a Roadblock zombie (R) in that same cell—can benefit from an extra shooter. The additional damage will help take down the 8‐HP zombie before it can overwhelm the weak plant in that cell.","Answer: H 1 2","Answer: W 1 4","Answer: J 4 5","Answer: J 3 1","Answer: J 4 4\n\nExplanation:\nRow4 is currently the most critical lane – it already hosts a Roadblock zombie (R) in column 3 and multiple zombies (including a High-Attack and Bucket zombies) in column 5. Placing a Wall-nut (J) at row4, column 4 (an empty cell) will add extra blocking, slowing down the advanced zombies and buying us more time before they reach your house. This move costs only 50 sun, leaving you sun for future plays while reinforcing your defense in the most threatened lane.","Answer: W 4 1\n\nI recommend planting a Peashooter (W) in row 4, column 1. With the heavier zombie threat already present in row 4 – a Roadblock zombie in column 2 and a cluster (a High-Attack and two Bucket zombies) at column 5 – adding extra firepower in that lane is critical. The Peashooter will immediately begin dealing 1 damage per turn to the left‐most zombie in row 4, helping to chip away at the advancing horde. This move costs 100 sun (leaving 130 sun for later turns) and will help slow the zombies’ progress while you plan your later defenses.","Answer: H 4 2;W 3 2\n\nI recommend using your 225 sun as follows. In row4 you already have a Peashooter at column 1 (shown as “WR”) that’s currently fighting a Roadblock Zombie. By placing a Torch Stump at (4,2), you immediately buff that existing Peashooter so that it deals an extra damage (raising its damage from 1 to 2). This extra damage can help whittle down the zombie faster before it reaches your house. \n\nMeanwhile, row3 has a Wall-nut with two Roadblock Zombies (“JRR” at column 1) protecting it. With only a basic Sunflower (X) at col0 and no attacker, the threat there isn’t being reduced fast enough. Planting a new Peashooter at (3,2) adds a bit of firepower—its shot will target the first (left‐most) zombie in that row (again at col1), helping to slow or kill the zombies and protect your lane.\n\nThe combined move uses exactly 225 sun (125 for the Torch Stump and 100 for the Peashooter), and it addresses the danger in both row3 and row4.","Answer: J 0 5\n\nHere's the reasoning behind this move:\n\n• With 95 sun available, only Sunflowers (50 sun) and Wall‐nuts (50 sun) can be afforded right now.\n• Looking at Row0, there’s already a Sunflower at column 0 and a Peashooter at column 1 and 3. However, the row’s rightmost cell (column 6) holds a High-Attack Zombie (I). With two empty cells (columns 4 and 5) between that zombie and the Peashooter at col3, the fast–moving, high–damage zombie will soon reach and destroy the vital offense.\n• Planting a Wall‐nut (J) in Row0, Column5 (which costs 50 sun) will serve as a durable barrier (10 HP) between the zombie and the plants behind it, slowing the advance and giving your shooters extra time.\n• After spending 50 sun, you’ll have 45 sun remaining, which is acceptable given the threat priority at this point in the game.\n\nThis move contributes to stalling the near–immediate danger on Row0 while preserving your sun reserve for future, more influential, placements.","Answer: J 4 3","Answer: W 4 4;X 0 4\n\nAnalysis:\n• With 185 sun available on turn 33, it’s important to shore up defenses in the row where zombies have clustered.\n• Looking at row4, the cell at column 3 already has a wall‐nut (J) but is currently hosting a fierce group (a high‐attack zombie “I” plus two bucket zombies “BB”). Planting an additional attacking unit just to the right (at column 4) will draw the zombies’ focus and allow its 1‐damage shot each turn to chip away at the advancing horde.\n• After spending 100 sun on a Peashooter (W), 85 sun remains. To further boost future sun income—and since placing a plant to the left of the current right‐most blocker won’t immediately become a target—we add a Sunflower (X) in row0 column 4. Row0 already has a blocking unit at col5 (the “JI” cell), so the new sunflower is temporarily safe while it begins producing an extra 10 sun per turn.\n• This combined move both strengthens defense where the pressure is heaviest (row4) and improves sun production for future turns.\n\nThus, the move is:\n W 4 4;X 0 4","Answer: H 3 3\n\nI’d like to boost our row 3 defense. Notice that row 3 already has a Peashooter in column 2 (W) that attacks the first zombie in that row. With two Roadblock zombies already in columns 0 and 1 threatening to break through, upgrading the W’s damage by planting a Torch Stump (H) immediately to its right at row 3, column 3 is our best urgent measure. The Torch Stump will add +1 damage to that Peashooter—making its 1‐damage shot become 2 damage per turn—and help thin out those zombies before they can do further harm. This move costs 125 sun, leaving us with 15 sun, and we will continue to get at least 25 sun per turn.","I suggest using our 120 sun to shore up defenses on our most threatened lane while also investing in our economy for later turns. In our current board the lane in row4 carries a heavy onslaught—a mixed horde (an I, then two Bs along with an incoming R at the far left) is already pressing against our right‐side Peashooter (W). If we let that shooter be the frontline, it’ll soon be overwhelmed. \n\nOne good idea is to “sacrifice” a cheap but sturdy Wall‐nut (J) as a temporary barrier so the zombies have to break through it before reaching the valuable shooter. In row4 the cell at column 5 is empty; if we plant a Wall‐nut there, it will “take the hit” instead of our W at col4. (Wall‐nuts cost 50 sun and have 10 HP.) \n\nAt the same time, future turns will demand more sun to afford heavier hitters (Torch Stumps, Three‐Line Shooters, etc.) so we want to strengthen our economy. A second Sunflower (X) costs only 50 sun and will generate an extra 10 sun per turn. Although no row is perfectly “safe” right now, row1 is a reasonable choice because its set-up (with a Sunflower already in col0, a Peashooter in col1, and a Torch Stump boosting it in col2) means a little extra economy there is worth the small risk. (We do lose a bit if the new sunflower gets eaten later, but the extra sun might allow us to invest in advanced plants in future rounds.)\n\nPlanting these costs a total of 50 + 50 = 100 sun, leaving us with 20 sun on turn 35.\n\nThus, my move is to plant:\n • a Wall‐nut (J) in row4, column5, and \n • a Sunflower (X) in row1, column6.\n\nFormatted as required, I answer: \n\nAnswer: J 4 5;X 1 6"],"prompt":"\nIn the following, you are required to participate in a simplified version of the Plants vs. Zombies game.

In order to strengthen your defense, it is advisable to add an extra shooter so that the collective damage output in that row increases. By planting a Peashooter (W, costing 100 sun) at row 3, column 1—the vacant cell—you add another unit that will, every turn, shoot 1 damage at the left‐most zombie in that row. The existing peashooter at row 3, column 2 already contributes, so overall you can deliver 2 damage in that row (and if the first zombie is eliminated, the next one will be hit in subsequent turns). Although an alternative would have been to invest 125 sun in a Torch Stump (H) to boost the damage of an adjacent shooter (for instance, to the right of the peashooter at col2), that move would have boosted that single plant’s damage from 1 to 2. In contrast, planting an additional Peashooter yields an additional independent damage source on every turn without relying on a one‑time boost. With sun now dropping to 25 for the start of the next cycle, you preserve enough economy while bolstering your defense in the critical row.\n\nThus, your move is:\n\nAnswer: W 3 1","Answer: W 2 5","Answer: H 2 6","Answer: X 1 3","Answer: W 2 3;W 2 4\n\nI'll explain my reasoning briefly:\n\nAt turn 19 we have 220 sun and several zombie‐incursions on the board. In most lanes the plants on the very right (the “front‐liners”) are solid enough (for example, the Wall‐nut “J” in row0 and row3 shield their rows), but row2 is perilous. There the only plant in the rightmost cell is a Torch Stump (H) with only 2 HP protecting the row—and it doesn’t shoot. In row2 zombies are already present (an R “Roadblock” zombie, whose base 8 HP is likely buffed by the rising difficulty to 12 HP) and if that zombie reaches one of the sunflowers (X, 2 HP) further left the defense would quickly crumble.\n\nBecause only Peashooters (W) and Three‐Line Shooters (S) deal damage to zombies, improving row2’s overall DPS is key. With 220 sun we can afford two standard Peashooters (each costing 100 sun) so that even though the blocking unit (the Torch Stump H in col6) will likely be eaten, our shooters placed in cells (2,3) and (2,4) will each turn contribute 1 damage in their row. In standard PvZ terms every shooter in a lane “fires” at the first approaching zombie regardless of its column, so building a combined 2 damage per turn should help eliminate the buffed Roadblock zombie faster than it can eat through the weak blocker and then damage the squishy behind‐it plants.\n\nThus, the chosen move is to plant two Peashooters in row 2 in the empty cells at columns 3 and 4. This costs 2×100 = 200 sun, leaving 20 sun for the turn.\n\nThat is why the move is:\n  Answer: W 2 3;W 2 4","Answer: J 3 2\n\nI recommend using 50 of your 145 sun to plant a Wall‑nut in row 3, column 2. Notice that row 3 already has a zombie (R) at column 2 which isn’t blocking a plant—since only one plant is allowed per cell and zombies don’t stop you from planting there, placing a Wall‑nut in that cell forces the zombie to attack the Wall‑nut (which has 10 HP) rather than immediately damaging your valuable Peashooter at row 3, column 1. This extra “buffer” should help delay the zombie’s advance and give your shooters more time to deal damage before the threat reaches the more vulnerable plants.","Answer: W 4 5;X 2 5\n\nI'm choosing to place a Peashooter (W) in row 4, column 5 to help chip away at the menacing Bucket Zombie (B) that’s already reached the far‐right in that row, and a Sunflower (X) in row 2, column 5 to boost sun income for upcoming turns.

A Peashooter planted at row 4, column 4 immediately begins firing at the advancing zombie.\nAt a cost of 100 sun each (total 200, leaving 5 sun), this move uses available resources to add essential offense in the lanes under immediate threat.","Answer: H 4 5","Answer: W 1 5; X 0 1","I'll choose to bolster our weakest defense in row 4.

Although it’s too late to “save” the plant already engaged, we can help future incoming zombies by planting a sturdy barrier. Placing a Wall‐nut (J, cost 50, 10 HP) at row1, col3 creates a new, durable obstacle that new zombies arriving from the right will first encounter rather than the vulnerable peashooter.\n\n• In row4 (Line4), the sunflower (X) at col3 is under assault by a Bucket (B) zombie. Planting a Wall‐nut at row4, col2 (an empty cell) will help “protect” that row so that subsequent zombies coming in will hit the tougher barrier instead of the fragile sunflower.\n\n• With our remaining sun (after spending 50 + 50 = 100 sun) we have 70 sun left. Investing 50 sun in an extra Sunflower (X) in a safe row (row0, col5, which is empty) boosts our future income (an extra +10 sun per turn). The extra sunflower in row0 is away from immediate zombie threats.\n\nThis uses a total of 50 + 50 + 50 = 150 sun (leaving 20 sun in reserve), and provides both short‐term defensive barriers (via the Wall‐nuts) and long‐term economic support (via the extra Sunflower).","Answer: W 1 6;X 0 6","Answer: W 3 5;X 1 2\n\nI'll explain briefly: With 160 sun available on turn 31, I chose to invest most in additional defense while also boosting your sun economy. Placing a Peashooter (W) at row 3, column 5 adds extra DPS to help take down the multiple zombies already threatening row 3 (notably the cluster in cell 6 with JRIN). Additionally, planting a Sunflower (X) at row 1, column 2 supplements your sun income while being safely tucked behind the more forward‐line plants in that lane.

More importantly, increasing your economy early on is key since Sunflowers generate extra sun (10 per turn) that will help afford stronger plants (like the Peashooter or Three-Line Shooter) in future turns when defending against advancing zombies becomes critical.","Answer: X 0 0","Answer: X 3 0","Answer: J 0 5","Answer: X 2 1\n\nI decided to use 50 sun to plant an extra Sunflower (X) in row 2, column 1. This not only costs less than our current sun (85) so we remain within our budget but also increases our sun output in subsequent turns, which will be crucial for affording stronger plants later on while we deal with the advancing zombies (notably the ones already present in row 0 and row 4).","Answer: W 4 3","Answer: X 1 1\n\nI decided to spend 50 sun on a Sunflower in row1, column1. This will boost our sun production (an extra 10 sun per turn) so that in future turns we can afford stronger defenses, such as Peashooters or even more expensive options. With the remaining 35 sun we can’t afford any other plant this turn since the cheapest cost is 50.","Answer: W 0 1\n\nI suggest planting a Peashooter in row 0 at column 1. Currently, row 0 has only a Sunflower at col 0, and there’s a zombie (a Regular Zombie, “N”) co‐occupying a Wall‑nut cell in col 5 that isn’t being attacked. Adding a shooter (W) to row 0 will begin chipping away at that approaching zombie, hopefully giving you time to build sun income or add further defenses later. This move costs 100 sun, leaving you with 20 sun for the turn while addressing the immediate threat.","Answer: W 2 4\n\nI'm choosing to plant a Peashooter (W) in row 2, column 4. With 105 sun available, spending 100 sun on a W leaves us with 5 sun remaining. Row 2 currently only has Sunflowers at columns 0 and 1, and the rightmost cell (column 6) harbors a Roadblock Zombie (R) with 8 HP. By placing a Peashooter farther to the right (in column 4), it can begin dealing damage to the zombie as soon as its turn comes (since players’ plants shoot each turn before zombies move), hopefully softening the threat before the zombie reaches one of our sun-producing plants behind.\n\nThis move addresses the immediate danger in row 2 by adding some offensive firepower, while our other lanes (row 0 and row 4) already have some plant defenses in place.\n\nGood luck on turn 12!","Answer: X 4 0","Answer: H 2 5","Answer: W 3 3","Answer: W 2 4\n\nI’ve decided to use our 100 sun to plant a Peashooter in row 2, column 4. Although there’s already a Roadblock Zombie (R) in that cell, that isn’t a problem because zombies can share the cell with a plant. More importantly, placing the Peashooter immediately to the left of the Torch Stump (H) in row 2 (at column 5) will give it the bonus +1 damage—raising its attack from 1 to 2 damage per turn. This extra damage is especially helpful against the Roadblock Zombie, whose HP is now boosted (and is more challenging than the regular zombies on other rows).","Answer: J 0 4","Answer: W 2 4\n\nI recommend placing a Peashooter in row 2, column 4. This cell is currently free of any plant (even though a Roadblock Zombie is already there), and doing so has an extra benefit: the Torch Stump already in row 2 at column 5 will buff the Peashooter’s damage by +1, allowing it to deal 2 damage per turn. Given that row 2 already contains multiple Roadblock Zombies (in column 4 and column 5), this boosted damage should help slow down their advance, protecting your sunflowers at the far left. This move costs 100 sun, leaving you with enough resources to continue building up your defense on future turns.","Answer: H 2 5\n\nAnalysis:\nLooking at the battlefield on turn 18 you have 135 sun. Notably, row2 has a Peashooter (W) at column 4 that faces a double threat from two Roadblock Zombies (“RR”) in column 5. Roadblock Zombies have 8 HP each so the normal 1‐damage shot from the Peashooter might not be enough to hold them back before they reach your plant.\n\nUsing the Torch Stump (H) – which costs 125 sun – you can place it immediately to the right of the existing Peashooter so that it buffs that shooter by +1 damage (raising its damage to 2 per turn). Although the cell already contains zombies (which is allowed since only plants can’t share a cell), there is no plant there yet so this placement is legal. With the extra firepower, the buffed Peashooter should be better able to take down the tough Roadblock Zombies.\n\nAfter spending 125 sun for the Torch Stump, you’ll have 10 sun remaining, so this move is the best use of your resources on turn 18.","Answer: W 2 2\n\nI recommend planting a Peashooter in row 2, column 2. With the roadblock zombies (R) at row 2, column 5 having 8 HP each and already positioned to block your existing Peashooter in row 2 (col4), adding another Peashooter in an empty cell further to the left will let both shoot the “first” zombie in that row each turn. The added firepower should help reduce the R zombies’ HP faster and delay their progress. Although your sun is only 105 (so buying a Peashooter for 100 leaves you with 5 sun), it seems important to bolster your defenses immediately given the threat in row 2.","Answer: W 0 2","Answer: J 1 5","Answer: H 2 3\n\nI’ve chosen to plant a Torch Stump (H) in row 2, column 3. This will boost the damage of the existing Peashooter in row 2 (at column 2) by +1, helping it better handle the tough zombies (the two Roadblocks already at row 2, column 3, and the High-Attack zombie in column 5).","Answer: W 2 6\n\nI’ve chosen to plant a Peashooter (W) in row 2 at column 6. Row 2 is currently facing a tough challenge—a pair of Roadblock Zombies (“R”) at column 3 and a High-Attack Zombie (“I”) at column 4. Although there is already one Peashooter (at column 2) in that row, adding another will help focus fire on these advancing enemies and increase the overall damage output per turn. This is important because the High-Attack Zombie, with its 6 HP and 3 damage per hit, can quickly overcome a vulnerable plant. With sun at 110, spending 100 on an extra attacker is a timely investment in defense (leaving 10 sun for now), rather than spending 50 on a Sunflower to boost economy—the immediate threat in row 2 justifies the extra damage.\n\nKeep in mind that as the game progresses you may need to adjust your strategy with additional Sunflowers for extra sun, specialized plants, or further blockers in other rows.","Answer: J 2 3\n\nAnalysis:\nRow2 is currently under heavy pressure with two Roadblock zombies already present in column 2 and a dangerous high‐attack zombie (I) in column 3. By planting a Wall‑nut (J) in row2, column 3—even though the cell already hosts a zombie—you create a tougher barrier (10 HP) to slow down the I zombie’s advance. This extra durability will help shield the peashooter already in row2 from being quickly overwhelmed by repeated attacks, giving your shooters more time to deal damage.\n\nThis decision uses 50 sun, leaving you with 55 sun, and is an economical way to bolster your defenses on a row that’s facing immediate danger.","Answer: W 1 3;X 3 1","Answer: J 3 2;X 1 2","Answer: W 3 4","Based on the current threats, one area that looks critical is row 0. There the wall‐nut in column 4 is being battered by a combination of a High‐Attack zombie (I) and a Roadblock zombie (R). The two existing peashooters in row 0 (in columns 1 and 2) appear to be doing their best to slow the zombies, but against a high‐attack foe their standard 1‐damage isn’t quite enough. One smart option is to boost the output of the peashooter in column 2 by planting a Torch Stump (H) immediately to its right (in column 3). The Torch Stump’s effect will increase that peashooter’s damage by +1—meaning it now deals 2 damage each turn—which should help clear the front‐line zombies faster before they can chew through the wall‐nut barrier.\n\nThis move costs 125 sun (and you have 135 sun on turn 28), leaving a little sun for later turns. (Other choices might be to add another shooter, but with the high‐attack zombie on the scene, buffing current firepower is key.) \n\nThus, the best move is to plant a Torch Stump in row 0, column 3.\n\nAnswer: H 0 3","Answer: W 2 3","Answer: H 1 4","Answer: X 4 1\n\nI'll plant a Sunflower at row 4, column 1. This costs 50 sun (leaving 60 sun for upcoming turns) and will help boost our sun income, which is especially useful later on when more expensive or critical plants are needed.","Answer: J 2 0\n\nExplanation:\nAt turn 32 with 175 sun available, the most urgent threat is in row2. A High‐Attack Zombie (“I”) is already in column 0 on row2, meaning it’s dangerously advanced. By planting a Wall‐nut (J, 50 sun) in row2 column 0—even though the zombie is currently there (plants can share a cell with zombies if no other plant exists)—you create a sturdy barrier (10 HP) to absorb the zombie’s attacks (which are 3 damage per turn) and delay its progress. This gives your peashooter in row2 (at column 3) time to shoot at the zombie once it becomes the “first” target again. With 175 sun, this is an efficient defensive use of your resources while you build your sun income and prepare for future turns.","Answer: H 0 3;X 4 5\n\nI decided to use 125 sun to plant a Torch Stump (H) at row0, column3. This Torch Stump will buff the peashooter immediately to its left (at row0, column2) – increasing its damage from 1 to 2 per turn – which should help take down the advancing Roadblock Zombie (R) that’s already paired with that cell. Then, spending 50 sun out of the 230 available, I planted a Sunflower (X) at row4, column5 to bolster sun income in a safer area of the board. This uses a total of 175 sun, leaving a little extra for subsequent turns.","Answer: H 2 4","Answer: W 3 3\n\nI'll explain my reasoning briefly. At turn 35 with 160 sun available, our board already shows several lanes with zombies steadily advancing. The row 3 situation is notably urgent: zombies already occupy cells in row 3 (for example, in col1 as a bucket zombie accompanying a vulnerable sunflower, and col2 with both a regular zombie and a roadblock zombie), leaving the leftmost sunflower in that row unprotected against the swift advance. By planting a Peashooter (W, costing 100 sun) into an empty cell (col3) on row 3, we add extra DPS that will target the foremost zombie in that row regardless of its exact location. This extra shooter should help us kill the approaching zombies faster and delay their progress toward our vital sunflowers.\n\nWith this move, our sun drops to 60 and we bolster row 3’s defense as we plan our subsequent plays in this challenging scenario.","Answer: W 0 5;X 4 2"],"prompt":"\nIn the following, you are required to participate in a simplified version of the Plants vs. Zombies game.

With 130 sun available, we can afford a Peashooter (W) for 100 sun, which will start shooting the zombie in its row every turn.

Row3 is especially dangerous because it currently has only one attacking plant (the peashooter) while row2 already benefits from two peashooters. By spending all 125 sun to plant a Torch Stump (H) at row3, column 5 (an empty cell immediately to the right of the peashooter at col4), you boost that peashooter’s damage from 1 to 2. This extra damage will help eliminate the 4‐HP zombie in row3 faster before it can move left and begin attacking the blocking sunflower in that row, offering a quicker defense.

Currently row2 has a Roadblock zombie (R) in that cell but no plant, so placing a Wall‐nut there is allowed. This Wall‐nut, with its 10 HP, will force the zombie to attack it rather than our valuable peashooter at row2 col3.

Row4 has no sunflower yet, and row2 only has one at col0, so placing a sunflower at row4 col0 and another at row2 col2 (an empty cell) will increase our sun income over the coming turns, helping us afford more expensive plants later on while our current defenses hold off the advancing zombies.","Answer: W 0 5","Answer: H 0 6;X 4 1","Answer: J 3 5\n\nI’m choosing to plant a Wall‐nut (J) in row 3, column 5—even though that cell already contains the high‐attack zombie (I)—because no plant is present there yet. By doing so, the Wall‐nut (with 10 HP) will become the blocking plant for row 3 instead of the current Peashooter (W) at column 4, which has only 2 HP and would be instantly eliminated by the 3‐damage attack of the high‐attack zombie. With the Wall‐nut in place, the Peashooter in row 3 will have extra time to consistently deal its 1 damage per turn to that zombie while the Wall‐nut slowly absorbs the zombie’s attacks (remember the zombie has 10 HP now and will be slowed down by having to “eat through” 10 HP instead of instantly killing a weak shooter).\n\nThis move costs 50 sun, keeping you under your current 145 sun—and it improves your lane’s defense at a critical moment.","Answer: W 0 5\n\nAnalysis:\n• In row0 the only attacker is the Torch Stump at col6—which itself doesn’t attack but boosts a plant immediately to its left.\n• A Bucket Zombie (B) with 12 HP is at row0 col5. By placing a Peashooter (W) in row0 col5—even though a zombie already occupies that cell—the new Peashooter will be directly to the left of the Torch Stump and thus receive +1 damage (dealing 2 damage per turn instead of only 1).\n• This boosted firepower in the row should help chip away at the bucket zombie before it progresses further.\n• The move costs 100 sun, leaving you with sun for future turns.\n\nThus, the recommended action is to plant a boosted Peashooter at row0 column5.","Answer: W 1 2\n\nI recommend placing an extra Peashooter in row 1, column 2. Row 1 is currently experiencing a concentrated zombie invasion (with both a Roadblock and a High-Attack Zombie already present in column 4), and while there’s already a shooter there, adding another will effectively double the damage output on the foremost zombie that turn.

This cell was empty and, by adding a W there, we add extra offensive support immediately left of the heavy zombie cluster in row 3 (currently at column 5). Since each Peashooter will target the first zombie in its row each turn, placing one at row 3, col 4 should help weaken the advancing group (which currently includes a Roadblock, a High-Attack, and a Bucket zombie).

Placing the Peashooter at row4 column 5 ensures it will help shoot the approaching zombie every turn—even though zombies always block on the leftmost plant, all shooter plants still fire each turn.\n• This combination both delays the zombie’s advance (thanks to the Wall‐nut) and increases your offensive firepower along row4.\n \nMake your moves accordingly!","Answer: H 0 5","Answer: W 1 5;X 1 4","I'll use my move to shore up the especially dangerous row 3. Notice that row 3 already has a Peashooter at column 1 that’s under heavy assault (three zombies sharing the cell). Since the Torch Stump (H) costs 125 sun and is designed to boost the damage of the plant immediately to its left (in this case, the shooter in col 1), placing one in row 3 at a column immediately to the right (an empty spot, say col 2) should help that shooter deal 2 damage per turn rather than only 1. This extra firepower will help slow down the zombie onslaught in that row.\n\nWith 165 sun on turn 37, spending 125 on a Torch Stump leaves 40 sun for now. (Unfortunately, 40 isn’t enough to buy even the Sunflower or Wall‐nut, which cost 50.)

Row2 is crowded (see cell 5 where a sunflower “X” coexists with a Bucket “B”, a Roadblock “R” and a Regular “N”), and although row2 already has two Peashooters (the “W” at col1 and col3), an extra shooter placed on an empty cell (col6) will add valuable firepower to help whittle down the cluster. That peashooter will each turn deal 1 damage (to the leftmost zombie in row2) on top of those already dealing damage. \n\nUsing the remaining 75 sun (100 for the Peashooter plus 50 for a Sunflower would cost 150, leaving the mandatory 25 that we gain each turn) we also plant a Sunflower in row3 col6. Row3 already has plants in col0 (a Sunflower “X” that is presently forced to block oncoming zombies that even share its cell along with a High‐Attack “I” and Bucket “B”), and by adding one more sunflower at the far right (an empty cell in col6) we gain an extra 10 sun per turn going forward without risking immediately “blocking” the front‐line. \n\nThus, the move “W 2 6; X 3 6” spends 100 + 50 = 150 sun—keeping us safely above our 25–sun floor—and boosts both our immediate offense on the crowded row2 and our longer‐term economy."],"prompt":"\nIn the following, you are required to participate in a simplified version of the Plants vs. Zombies game.

This extra sun will pay off in future turns so we can afford stronger defenses or offensive plants later. Since several rows (for example, row0) currently have no zombie presence and only one sunflower at col0, adding another sunflower at row0, col1 is a safe and effective spot that maximizes our sun production without compromising our existing defensive setup.\n\nThus, the chosen move is: \"X 0 1\".","Answer: W 1 2\n\nI recommend planting a Peashooter (W) in row1, column2. This extra shooter will join the one already at row1, col3 to help deal more damage to the advancing Regular Zombies (N) that are currently threatening the wall‐nut defenses (J) in that row. While the wall‐nuts are holding the zombies back, the additional firepower should help eliminate the left‐most zombie faster, reducing the pressure on your defenses.","Answer: J 4 5","I'll use 50 sun to buy a Wall‑nut (J) and plant it in row 3, column 4. This will serve as a temporary barrier against the lone zombie in row 3 (the Regular Zombie “N” in column 5) so that it can’t quickly reach our vulnerable sunflowers in that row. With the remaining sun (90 sun left), we can plan future moves on subsequent turns.\n\nAnswer: J 3 4","Answer: W 3 2\n\nI recommend planting a Peashooter (W) in row 3, column 2. This will add extra firepower to row 3 so that the zombie (currently sharing the wall-nut cell at col 4) gets attacked sooner while the wall‐nut continues to hold its position. With 175 sun available, spending 100 sun here leaves some sun for future moves while reinforcing your defense.","Answer: H 3 3\n\nAnalysis:\nIn the current situation the zombie in row3‐col4 (blocking the path with its wall‐nut) looks to be the most immediate threat. Row3 already has a peashooter at col2 that would normally deal 1 damage per turn to the first zombie in that row. By planting a Torch Stump (H) to its immediate right (at row3 col3), the peashooter’s damage is increased by +1 (from 1 to 2 damage per turn). This extra damage should help bring down the advancing zombie faster before it can destroy the wall‐nut that’s currently blocking it. With 160 sun available and the Torch Stump costing 125 sun, this is an efficient defensive play for turn 14, leaving 35 sun unspent (not enough to plant any other sun‐producing or attacking plant).","Answer: W 4 1","Answer: W 4 2","Answer: X 2 3\n\nI'm choosing to plant a Sunflower (X) in row 2, column 3 for a couple of reasons. It’s an affordable 50‐sun investment that will boost our sun production in upcoming turns. Since no zombies are currently pressing on row 2, this spot is safe and will help us build up our sun reserves for stronger plants in the future.","Answer: W 4 3\n\nI recommend using our 100 sun to plant a Peashooter (W) at row 4, column 3. This placement puts extra firepower in row 4 to help counter the advancing Roadblock zombies that are currently gathered at column 5 (guarding a Wall-nut). With 135 sun available, spending 100 leaves us with some reserve, and the additional DPS should help slow the zombies’ progress while our other plants (like our Sunflowers) boost our sun economy.","Answer: W 4 6","I'll use the available 125 sun mainly to shore up the row under pressure. Notice that row4 already has zombies (see “WR” at column 3 and “RR” at column 4) that are likely to continue advancing. One way to slow them down is to add a durable blocker—in this case a Wall-nut (J, costing 50 sun and having 10 HP) to delay the zombies and give our shooters more time. There is an empty cell in row4 at column 5, so I recommend placing a Wall-nut there.\n\nThis move costs 50 sun and leaves 75 sun in reserve. With those remaining 75 sun you won’t be able to afford another peashooter (100 sun) or a boost (Torch Stump costs 125 sun) this turn, but you can always save on later turns. (A sunflower would have been a nice economy boost at 50 sun, but given the immediate threat on row4, the defensive benefit of a Wall-nut is more urgent.)\n\nThus, my move is:\n\nAnswer: J 4 5","Answer: W 3 5\n\nI suggest placing a Peashooter in row 3, column 5 because that cell is empty and adding offensive firepower in that row will help thin out the threatening zombie(s) advancing in row 3 (notably the Roadblock zombie(s) shown in column 6). This extra shooter will add an additional instance of 1‐damage per turn against the leftmost enemy in that row, helping to manage the incoming threat while you maintain sun production and plan for future moves.","Answer: J 3 6\n\nI recommend placing a Wall‐nut (J) on row 3, column 6. This will give the zombies in that row an extra barrier to chew through—even though it costs only 50 sun, its 10 HP will better stall the approaching Roadblock\/Bucket zombies, letting your existing shooters deal damage over time.","Answer: W 2 6;J 4 4","Answer: W 4 3;X 1 0","Answer: W 4 2\n\nI'm choosing to plant a Peashooter (W) in row 4, column 2. With our current sun of 110, spending 100 sun on W leaves us with a slight remainder while immediately adding extra firepower on row 4—where zombies have already advanced (note the “WR” in column 1 and “JN” in column 5). A Peashooter in column 2 will help focus fire on the most pressing zombie in that row, hopefully tipping the balance in our defense as the zombies continue to approach.","Answer: J 4 6\n\nI recommend using a Wall‑nut (J) in row 4, column 6. That cell currently holds only a zombie (a High‑Attack “I”), and since plants and zombies can coexist, placing a Wall‑nut there won’t violate the “one plant per cell” rule. The Wall‑nut “J” (cost 50 sun, 10 HP) will serve as a sturdier barrier against the high‐attack zombie. With zombies coming relentlessly from the right and moving left each turn, reinforcing the rightmost cell in row 4 will delay the approach of that dangerous “I” zombie and buy time for your attacking plants to reduce its health. This move uses 50 sun out of your current 115 sun, leaving you with 65 sun for future actions.","Answer: J 4 1;W 2 5\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n• Row2 currently has two Roadblock zombies (RR) in column 6 with only a couple of Sunflowers (X) behind them. Placing a Peashooter (W) at row2, column5 (an empty cell) gives you a shooter that will start chipping away at the advancing zombies from a nearby position. The Peashooter costs 100 sun.\n\n• In row4, there is a Roadblock zombie (R) in column1 that is dangerously close to the Sunflower at column0. By planting a Wall-nut (J; cost 50 sun) at row4, column1, you establish a sturdier barrier (Wall-nuts have 10 HP) to slow the zombie’s progress and protect your vital sun-producing plant.\n\nThis move costs 100 + 50 = 150 sun, keeping you within your current 170 sun budget while reinforcing defense in rows that are under immediate threat.","Answer: H 2 6","Answer: W 2 4\n\nI recommend placing a Peashooter (W) in row 2, column 4. In row 2 there are currently only a couple of Sunflowers (which are very fragile) to the left (columns 0 and 3), while the zombie presence (\"RR\" in column 5) is already advancing. A Peashooter placed immediately to the left (in column 4) of those zombies will force them to attack it rather than continuing to attack the more vulnerable Sunflower in column 3, and it will also help chip away at their health quickly. This move costs 100 sun (leaving 5 sun remaining) for immediate defense on the row that currently lacks an attacking plant.","Answer: X 1 1","Answer: W 2 2; X 0 2\n\nI’m choosing to spend 100 sun placing a Peashooter in row 2, column 2 to help deal with the advancing zombie clusters (especially the Roadblock pair in col4 and the Bucket zombie in col6) that aren’t being hit yet by any offensive plant. In addition, spending 50 sun on a Sunflower in row 0 at column 2 (a safe spot with only friendly sunflowers already around) helps boost our sun income for upcoming turns. This balanced choice of improving our immediate defense and increasing our economy should help us both contain the enemy and prepare for the later, tougher waves.","Answer: H 3 3\n\nExplanation:\nWith 150 sun on turn 32, a key concern is slowing down and eliminating the advancing Bucket Zombie in row3 at column2. By planting a Torch Stump (H) at row3, column3, you buff the peashooter (W) already at row3, column2—raising its damage from 1 to 2 per turn. This extra damage will help in dispatching the Bucket Zombie faster, reducing the threat on that row.","Answer: W 4 5; X 0 3","Answer: H 2 3\n\nAnalysis:\nLooking at the board at turn 34, row2 is of particular concern. There’s already a peashooter (W) at cell (2,2), but it’s currently facing two Roadblock zombies (R) with 8 HP each in the same cell. In its normal state the peashooter deals only 1 damage per turn, which might not be enough to take down the first zombie quickly before it can damage the plant.\n\nBy spending all 125 sun to plant a Torch Stump (H) at (2,3) – immediately to the right of the existing peashooter – you boost that plant’s damage by +1 (making it 2 damage per turn). This helps cut down on the time needed to defeat the advancing Roadblock and reduces the threat against your defenses.\n\nThus, the move “H 2 3” is your advisable play this turn.","Answer: H 4 6\n\nI recommend planting a Torch Stump (H) at row 4, column 6. This placement puts H immediately to the right of the Peashooter (W) already at row 4, column 5. The boosted Peashooter will deal 1 extra damage per turn—which should help against the heavy zombie cluster (I, R, B) currently in row 4. With exactly 125 sun available, H is a cost‐exact move that both reinforces your defense and increases firepower where it’s most needed.","I'll plant a Peashooter in row 2, column 2 to help with the heavy zombie presence there. This uses 100 sun (leaving 25 sun) and gets a shooter firing immediately on row 2 to start chipping away at the zombies already advancing.\n\nAnswer: W 2 2","Answer: J 1 4; J 2 4","Answer: H 1 3\n\nI decided to buff the existing Peashooter in row 1 (located at column 2) by planting a Torch Stump (H) at row 1, column 3. This placement is legal even though there’s already a zombie in that cell—and it will boost the peashooter’s damage by +1 (applied directly to the plant’s shot) so that it can deal extra damage to its front‐line zombie. With 155 sun available, spending 125 sun here leaves you with enough remaining resource while strengthening your defense against the high‐attack zombie (I) that currently occupies row 1.","Answer: H 1 3\n\nI’ve chosen to plant a Torch Stump (H) at row 1, column 3. In row 1 the existing Peashooter (W) at column 2 faces the advancing high‐attack zombie (I) now in column 3. By placing the Torch Stump immediately to its right, that Peashooter’s damage is boosted by +1 (raising its damage from 1 to 2 per turn), which should help dispatch the tough high‐attack zombie more quickly. \n\nThis move costs 125 sun (leaving 20 sun remaining) and gives the row an extra edge in defense at this crucial turn."],"prompt":"\nIn the following, you are required to participate in a simplified version of the Plants vs. Zombies game.

In row 2 there’s a Sunflower at col0 (which is boosting our sun income) and a Wall-nut already at col4 facing the advancing zombie. By placing an extra Wall-nut at col3, the incoming zombie will first reach this new buffer, delaying its progress further.

This decision is based on the following reasoning:\n\n• Row2 already has a zombie (N) sharing a cell with a wall‐nut (J) at column 4. Because zombies advance from right to left, the one in row2 is a bit closer to breaching your defenses.\n\n• A Peashooter will deal 1 damage per turn to the first (i.e. most advanced) zombie in its row, helping to whittle down its 4‑HP before it causes too much damage to the blocking wall‐nut.\n\n• With exactly 100 sun available this turn, a Peashooter is the only plant you can afford that will actively damage the zombie threat.\n\nThus, planting W at row 2, column 1 gives you an immediate offensive measure while you continue to build your defenses in the coming turns.","Answer: J 3 5\n\nI’ve chosen to plant a Wall-nut (J) in row 3, column 5. This cost of 50 sun will leave you with 15 sun for now, and it creates a stronger stopper for the regular zombie (N) currently advancing in row 3.

With 105 sun available this turn, spending 100 sun on a Peashooter (W) in row1 (for example at column 3) provides immediate offensive support by damaging that zombie each turn. This extra firepower will help slow its advance before it reaches your Sunflower, while still keeping your sun income somewhat stable for future turns.","Answer: X 0 0\n\nI’ve chosen to plant a Sunflower (X) in row 0, column 0. This serves two purposes: placing it behind the already‐established front line (the Wall‐nut at row0, col4, which is currently holding back the oncoming zombie) ensures that it isn’t immediately attacked, and it will start generating an extra 10 sun per turn. With our current 80 sun, spending 50 now leaves us with enough reserve, and it strengthens our long‐term economy to help us afford stronger plants like Peashooters or even a Three-Line Shooter when we have more sun.","Answer: W 1 2\n\nI'm choosing to plant a Peashooter (W) in row 1, column 2. With 115 sun available and facing an immediate threat from the Roadblock Zombie (R) already in row 1, bolstering the damage output in that row is critical. The existing Peashooter in row 1 (currently sharing cell 3 with the zombie) is already under pressure, and adding another one in an adjacent column will increase the total damage in that row—helping to take down the tougher Roadblock Zombie (8 HP) faster. This move uses 100 sun, leaving a small surplus for the turn while ensuring better defense in a vulnerable lane.","Answer: W 4 2","Answer: J 4 4\n\nI’ve chosen to plant a Wall‐nut (J) in row 4, column 4. This placement will help block the advancing Roadblock Zombie already in row 4 (currently in column 5) so that your Peashooter in the same row (at column 2) has more time to deal damage. With your available sun (85) and the immediate threat in row 4, strengthening your defense is the best move at turn 17.","Answer: W 1 1","Answer: J 1 2\n\nI recommend using 50 sun to plant a Wall‐nut (J) at row 1, column 2. In row 1 the only other plant is the Peashooter (W) at col 1, and there’s an unprotected Roadblock zombie (R) in col 2; by placing a Wall‐nut there, you provide an extra 10‑HP barrier (with 10 HP) that the zombie must attack instead of directly damaging your valuable Peashooter. This should help stall the zombie and let your Peashooter keep firing at it, while still keeping your sun reserve (105 – 50 = 55 sun left) for future moves.","Answer: W 0 3","Answer: H 4 3\n\nI'm choosing to place a Torch Stump (H) in row 4, column 3. This cell is currently empty and is directly to the right of the existing Peashooter at row 4, column 2. Boosting that peashooter’s damage from 1 to 2 should help it deal with the zombies that are already on row 4. Given that we have exactly 125 sun this turn, spending it all on the Torch Stump is an aggressive defensive move aimed at holding back the advancing threat.","Answer: X 2 2\n\nI’m choosing to plant a Sunflower (X) in row 2, column 2. This not only adds another sun generator to boost our economy for future turns but also places it away from the immediately active zombie lanes. With the current sun of 85, spending 50 leaves us with some reserve while steadily building our resources as the game continues.","Answer: W 3 3\n\nI'll explain my choice briefly: At turn 23 we have 130 sun. With the current board the main concern is row3, which only has a sunflower at column 0, and now faces a regular zombie in column 4. Adding a Peashooter (W) in row3—here placed at column 3—will let it shoot the advancing zombie before it reaches a vital plant. This provides necessary offensive support on row3 while keeping our resource expenditure within our sun budget.","Answer: J 0 2;J 3 2","Answer: W 0 1","Answer: W 3 1","I'll spend 50 sun to add an extra Wall‐nut (J) in row4, column3. Although there's already a zombie there (a High‐Attack Zombie “I”), planting a Wall‐nut in that cell is allowed since no plant is present. This extra Wall‐nut will force the high‐attack zombie to focus on damaging it (taking only 3 damage per turn against its 10 HP) rather than attacking the valuable Peashooter in col2. With this extra buffer, our defenses in row4 will hold off the incoming damage a bit longer while our shooters keep chipping the zombies.\n\nAnswer: J 4 3","Answer: J 1 2","Answer: W 0 3;W 4 4\n\nMy reasoning is as follows. With 200 sun available on turn 29—and with zombies already pressing in every row—it’s important to boost our damage output quickly. Reviewing the board:\n\n• In row 0 the only shooter is the Peashooter at (0,1), but that row already shows a heavy mix of zombies (a Roadblock and a Bucket) in column 2 behind a Wall‐nut. Adding another shooter further right (at (0,3)) should help wear them down faster.\n\n• In row 4 the lone shooter is at (4,2) while column 3 already has a Wall‐nut protecting zombies (a High-Attack and a Regular). A second Peashooter at (4,4) will add some needed firepower to help clear that row.\n\nBoth placements cost 100 sun each, using our full 200 sun for the turn. Moving forward, extra damage should help delay the zombies’ advance while you build toward stronger defenses in later turns.","I'll go with an extra Sunflower—to boost your sun economy for later turns—placed in an empty, reasonably safe cell. In row2 the cell in column4 is open, and because there’s already a wall‐nut in column3 protecting that row, your new Sunflower will, at least briefly, be safe while generating extra sun (10 per turn).\n\nThus, I recommend: \n\nAnswer: X 2 4","Answer: H 4 3\n\nAnalysis:\nWe only have 150 sun this turn, and our current zombie pressure – especially on row 4, where a peashooter in column 2 is already under attack and additional zombies are gathering at column 6 – makes it important to boost our offensive capability. By placing a Torch Stump (H) in the empty cell at row 4, column 3, we buff the peashooter immediately to its left. This gives it an extra damage point each turn, helping it dispatch the row’s advancing zombies more quickly. With the Torch Stump costing 125 sun, we use most of our sun reserves while gaining a crucial defensive and offensive improvement on a vulnerable row.","Answer: H 1 2\n\nAnalysis:\nWe have 130 sun available and only a few planting options are affordable. In row1, there’s already an attacking Peashooter (W) at column1 but it’s facing two zombies (an I in column2 and another I in column5). Its base damage is 1 per turn, which may be too low to deal with the high‐attack I’s (which deal 3 damage each). By placing a Torch Stump (H, cost 125 sun) immediately to the right of that peashooter—that is, at row1, column2—we buff that Peashooter by +1 damage (its attack becomes 2 damage per turn). Although there’s currently a zombie (an I) in that cell, the rules allow planting on a cell that contains zombies (as long as no plant is there already). This boost should help the Peashooter take down the advancing high‐attack zombie(s) more quickly.\n\nThus, the recommended move is to plant H at row 1, column 2.","Based on the battlefield, the most worrisome row is Line4. In that row the left‐most cell (column 0) is occupied by a fragile Sunflower (X with 2 HP) and there are already multiple zombies (an I and an N) in column 1. (Recall that zombies move left and stop at the very first nonempty cell in their row.) If that blocking Sunflower falls, the fresh zombies in the rear (for example, in column 4 where there’s a Peashooter that partially defends but isn’t in front yet) will have a free path. (Also note that even though several rows have a Sunflower in column 0, all of them are equally vulnerable—and row4 faces two different zombie cells.) \n\nBecause you have 110 sun this turn, your only options are the cheaper plants: a Sunflower (cost:50), a Wall‐nut (50) or a Peashooter (100). A Wall‐nut would normally be an excellent choice for soaking hits, but you cannot plant it in column 0 because that cell is already occupied. Placing one further to the right won’t change who the zombies hit—the very left plant is the “blocker.” \n\nIt makes sense, then, to boost the damage output along this row so that more damage is applied toward the zombies (especially the one in column 1) before they get a chance to rip through the weak Sunflower. A Peashooter (W) in row 4 will add another 1 point of damage per turn (even if it’s not the very first plant in the row; all shooters in the row contribute their damage to the “first” zombie), hastening the elimination of the approaching threats. \n\nAn ideal placement is on Line4 in an empty cell (say, column 2) so that it immediately adds extra firepower. That move costs 100 sun—leaving 10 sun unused (no other plant is affordable with 10 sun).\n\nSo the move is:\n\nAnswer: W 4 2","Answer: J 0 1;J 4 1","Answer: J 1 1","I recommend using your sun wisely to buy a low‐cost “stall” in the row where two high‐attack zombies (I) are assaulting the only barrier. Notice that on row1 you have only a sunflower (X at col0) and a wall‐nut (J at col1) that’s already taking 6 damage in total every turn (two “I” zombies dealing 3 damage each). The extra barrier you can add right in front (that is, in a higher column than the one at col1) will “push back” the point where the zombies must attack. In PvZ the zombies stop as soon as they reach the first plant (“the front‐line plant” in the row), so if you plant a Wall‐nut (J, 10 HP, cost 50) in an empty cell farther to the right (say, at column 2 in row1), that new Wall‑nut will become the barrier and delay the zombies even by just one extra turn. (Even though it too will likely be overwhelmed soon, that extra turn may be the extra time you need for your shooters to deliver more damage in coming turns.) \n\nSince you currently have Sun:135, spending 50 sun on one Wall‑nut will leave you with 85 sun for future turns. (Other options such as buying a Peashooter for extra firepower cost 100 sun but then leave you with less reserve, and a boosted shooter with a Torch Stump is even more expensive. Meanwhile, the most immediate danger is on row1 with the pair of high‐attack zombies.) \n\nSo the move is to plant a Wall‑nut (J) in row1 at column2.\n\nAnswer: J 1 2","Answer: J 2 1","I recommend using 100 sun to add extra offensive firepower where the zombie pressure is heaviest—and then investing the remaining 50 sun in extra economy. In the current state the row that worries me most is row4 (with a wall‐nut in col1, zombies at col2 and a bucket zombie in col4), because it has several zombie types attacking a nonattacking sunflower in col0. Adding a Peashooter (W) behind the wall‐nut (for example, putting it in an empty cell in col3 so that it “joins” the battle) will give row4 an extra 1 damage per turn toward that first zombie. \n\nThen, with the remaining 50 sun (remember that a Sunflower “X” costs 50 and generates an extra 10 sun each turn) you can boost your future economy. (Even though every row already has a sunflower in column 0, an extra one placed further to the right won’t be exposed immediately to the zombie‐rush from the far right.) For instance, you can place an extra Sunflower on row2 at column6 (a cell that is currently empty) so that later turns let you build even more defenses when needed.\n\nThus my move is:\n\n  Answer: W 4 3;X 2 6\n\nThis uses 100 sun for the row4 Peashooter (W) and 50 sun for the extra Sunflower (X), leaving you with 35 sun unspent this turn.","Answer: W 1 6\n\nI decided to add an extra shooter in row 1. Currently row 1 only has a Wall‐nut at column 2 while dangerous High-Attack zombies (I) have already reached column 0. By placing a Peashooter (which costs 100 sun) in an empty cell far on the right (column 6), it won’t be immediately attacked because the blocking comes from the zombie‐occupied cell at column 0, yet it will start targeting whatever is the first zombie in row 1 (namely one of the I zombies in column 0). Although the damage is only 1 per turn, it will at least chip away at their 6 HP while buying time for your stronger defenses lower the lane’s pressure. With your available sun of 120, spending 100 on a Peashooter seems like a reasonable trade‐off for immediate offense in the row that is most vulnerable."],"prompt":"\nIn the following, you are required to participate in a simplified version of the Plants vs. Zombies game.

The Wall-nut costs 50 sun (leaving 20 sun from the available 70) and has 10 HP, which should delay the zombie’s advance and protect the sunflower (at row 2, column 0) behind it, giving you time to accumulate more sun for future moves.","Answer: X 0 0","Answer: X 3 0","Answer: X 1 0","Answer: J 4 5","Answer: X 2 1\n\nI'll plant an extra Sunflower (X) at row 2, column 1. This choice will boost our sun production in the coming turns, helping us afford stronger plants once the zombies get more persistent. Meanwhile, row 2 is already guarded by the Wall-nut (J) at column 4 that’s currently holding a Regular Zombie (N), so the new sunflower will be protected from immediate danger.","Answer: W 2 3\n\nI recommend planting a Peashooter in row 2, column 3. Here’s the reasoning:\n\n• In row 2 you already have two Sunflowers (in col0 and col1) and a Wall‑nut in col4 that is currently “blocking” the advancing zombie (which appears as “JN” in col4). However, Sunflowers don’t attack. By planting the Peashooter in col3 (i.e. behind the blocking Wall‑nut), you add extra firepower without changing the blocking order. (Remember that zombies always attack the rightmost plant in their row. With the Wall‑nut still in col4, the zombie will keep attacking it while your Peashooter in col3 fires each turn at the first zombie in row 2.) \n\n• At 100 sun, this move costs most of your 110 sun but it strengthens your defense in the row where the zombie is more advanced.\n\nThis move makes the most efficient use of your current sun while reinforcing the row under pressure.","Answer: X 3 1\n\nI recommend planting a Sunflower (X) in row 3, column 1. At 85 sun, Sunflower is the only affordable option (costing 50), and it will boost your sun income by 10 per turn—an important investment before turn 10 brings stronger and additional zombie spawns (and stronger ones after turn 10\/20). Since row 3 already has one Sunflower at col0, placing another in an adjacent cell (col1) provides extra sun production without interfering with the front‐line defense (note that zombies attack the rightmost plant in a row, and row 3 remains clear of zombie threats).\n\nThus, with this move you increase your long‑term economy while not compromising defense.","Answer: W 4 3","I'll opt to hold back on increasing the sun economy and instead shore up our defense where the zombies seem most vulnerable. Notice that in row 3 we only have two fragile Sunflowers in column 0 and 1, while a Roadblock (R-type) Zombie is already on the far‐right (column 6). Even though a Peashooter (W) would add some damage, it would likely get eaten in just two hits—barely denting an 8‐HP Roadblock—but then the zombie would continue its advance. Instead, a Wall‐nut (J) at row 3, column 5 (the cell immediately to the left of the zombie) would not shoot but its 10 HP lets it stall the zombie for many turns (each attack doing only 1 damage), buying us precious time to generate extra sun (especially from our Sunflowers) and make further plans.\n\nSince a Wall‐nut costs only 50 sun and we currently have 105 sun, we can afford this move while keeping some extra sun for later.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\nAnswer: J 3 5","Answer: W 3 2","Answer: W 1 6\n\nExplanation:\nAt turn 13 you have 125 sun available but no defensive shoot plant in row1 – only a sunflower in column0. Since zombies spawn on the far‐right (column6) and then work leftward, row1 is vulnerable if a zombie appears there. By spending 100 sun to plant a Peashooter (W) in row1 at column6, you secure a defensive line that will immediately begin attacking any zombie entering row1. This uses your available sun efficiently (leaving 25 sun) while helping counter the increased threat from the upcoming zombie spawn.","Answer: J 3 4;X 4 0\n\nAnalysis:\nWith 110 sun available this turn and a noticeable zombie threat in row 3 (where a Roadblock Zombie and a Regular Zombie are currently sharing the cell with an existing Wall‐nut), it makes sense to both fortify that row and boost sun production for future turns. By planting a Wall‐nut (J, cost 50 sun) in row 3, column 4, you create a new barrier that forces the zombies to attack it instead of reaching the vital shooters behind. At the same time, adding a Sunflower (X, cost 50 sun) in an unoccupied cell (row 4, column 0) will provide extra sun (10 per turn) to help fund stronger plants later on.\nThis use of 100 sun leaves 10 sun unused, which is acceptable.\n","Answer: W 3 3","Answer: W 0 5","Answer: J 0 4","Answer: W 0 3\n\nExplanation:\nLooking at the battlefield, row0 currently has only a sunflower at col0 and a wall‐nut at col4 guarding against a pair of zombies (a Roadblock and a Regular Zombie) at col5. The wall‐nut does not attack, so row0 is lacking offensive defense. With 140 sun available, planting a Peashooter (W, cost 100 sun) in row0 will add the required firepower to begin damaging the approaching zombies. It should be placed to the left of the zombies but as far to the right as possible, and col3 is ideal since col4 is already occupied by the wall‐nut. This action uses 100 sun (leaving 40 sun for future turns) and bolsters your defense just in time before the next zombie spawn.","Answer: W 0 2\n\nI'll plant a Peashooter in row 0, column 2. This move costs 100 sun, leaving us with 35 sun for now. Adding another damage dealer in the row currently contested by zombies (the ones appearing with the wall‐nut in row 0) should help bring down those approaching Roadblock and Regular zombies before they can breach our defenses.","Answer: W 0 1\n\nAnalysis:\nThe biggest danger on turn 20 is the zombie cluster already in row 0 (the cell at column 4 showing \"JRN\" carries both a Wall‐nut and a Roadblock plus a Regular Zombie). Since the zombies advance one cell per turn and our shooters only fire to the right (i.e. toward oncoming zombies), it is crucial that our attackers be placed to the left of any zombie in their row. In row 0 the only available spot to the left of column 4 is at column 1 (since column 0 already has a Sunflower and columns 2–3 house Peashooters). Planting a new Peashooter (W, costing 100 sun) at row 0, column 1 adds an extra source of damage against the advancing zombies. Even though it leaves us with only 30 sun left this turn, boosting our firepower now should help us reduce the threat.","Answer: W 2 5","Answer: W 2 2","I'll opt to strengthen your long‐term economy by adding extra sun production early on. In your current board you already have a good number of offensive plants protecting rows that are under immediate pressure (rows 0, 2, and 3), while row 1 and row 4 are currently quite safe. Since you have 115 sun available and Sunflowers cost 50 sun (and yield an extra 10 sun per turn), planting two extra Sunflowers in safe spots will pay off over the long run.\n\nLooking at the board:\n• Row1 currently has a Sunflower at col0 and a Peashooter at col6; cells like col3 are empty.\n• Row4 already has a Sunflower at col0, but col6 is empty.\n\nThus, I recommend planting a Sunflower in row1, column3 and another one in row4, column6. This will cost a total of 100 sun (50 each), leaving you with 15 sun remaining.\n\nInput using the required format:\nAnswer: X 1 3;X 4 6\n\nThis move boosts your sun income so you’ll have more funds to fund stronger defenses or offensive options (like a Three‐Line Shooter or Fire Chili) in later turns.","Answer: W 0 5\n\nAnalysis:\nWe have 130 sun this turn and face an urgent threat in row0 where a regular zombie (“N”) is already clogging the lane with a wall‐nut (“J”) in cell (0,4). Although row0 already contains three attacking Peashooters (at columns 1–3), their combined 3 damage per turn may take too long to finish off the 4‐HP zombie before it advances and harms our vital sunflowers. By adding an extra Peashooter to row0 in the empty cell at (0,5) (costing 100 sun), we boost that row’s firepower from 3 to 4 damage per turn. This should allow the zombie to be eliminated in one round once all shooters fire, protecting the sunflower in (0,0) and helping to delay the zombie’s progress. With 30 sun remaining (insufficient for another plant), this move is our best immediate defense.\n\nSo the move is: W 0 5","Answer: X 1 1\n\nI’ve chosen to plant a Sunflower (X) in row 1, column 1. This move costs 50 sun (reducing our sun from 145 to 95) and boosts our economy by adding 10 extra sun each turn. Even though we already have some defenses in rows 2 and 3 where zombies are present, we’re not currently in a position to afford a higher‐cost defensive plant (like a Peashooter or Torch Stump) and our safe lane (row 1) is a good spot to increase our future sun income for tougher turns ahead.","Answer: H 2 4;J 1 5\n\nI'll explain the reasoning briefly:\n\n• In row2 there’s a peashooter at column 3 that’s currently dealing with a Bucket and Roadblock zombie. Boosting its damage with a Torch Stump (H) placed immediately to its right at (row2, col4) should help it hit harder, potentially speeding up the elimination of those zombies.\n\n• In row1 the zombies in column 6 are beginning to contest a peashooter there, but the row’s other plants are very fragile. Placing a Wall-nut (J) at (row1, col5) can serve as a more durable barrier to delay the zombies’ progress and buy extra time for your shooters.\n\nThese moves use 125 + 50 = 175 sun (leaving 45 sun remaining) while addressing immediate threats in rows 1 and 2.","Answer: W 1 2\n\nI noticed that row1 only has Sunflowers and a Wall-nut so far, and it’s currently hosting two Regular Zombies at column 6. Planting a Peashooter in row1 at column 2 (an empty cell) will provide the needed offense, shooting those zombies as they approach.

Placing a Sunflower (X, cost 50 sun) there not only uses the remaining sun (155 – 100 = 55 available, which covers the cost) but also boosts sun generation by 10 per turn for future defense.\nThis combined move both strengthens our offense on a lane under siege and improves our economy for upcoming turns.","Answer: W 1 4\n\nI recommend planting a Peashooter in row 1, column 4. This spot is empty and is immediately adjacent (to the right) of the heavy zombie wave (NNIRI) that’s currently in row 1, col 3. Adding an extra shooter in that row boosts your firepower and can help take down the advancing zombies faster, while keeping the stronger plants on the far right to absorb any incoming attacks. \n\nThis move costs 100 sun (leaving you with 70 sun for the turn), which is within your 170 sun budget at turn 35.","Answer: J 2 1","Answer: F 4 6\n\nAnalysis:\nRow4 is facing a dangerous situation with two high‐attack zombies (I) in columns 4 and 5 that pose an immediate threat to the plants in that row (in particular the peashooter at column 3 and the sunflowers in columns 0–2). Using a Fire Chili (F) costs 300 sun and will eliminate all zombies in the selected row instantly, helping to secure that row. With 320 sun available this turn, placing F at row4 column6 (an open cell) is a strategic move that clears the advanced, high‐damage zombies from row4 and minimizes the risk of losing key sun and attacking plants.\n\nThus, the chosen move is to plant F in row4 at column6.","Answer: X 2 0;W 1 2\n\nExplanation:\n• I’ve chosen to invest in our long‐term economy by planting a Sunflower (X) in row 2, column 0. This row currently lacks a sun‐generator, and placing one far to the left keeps it safe while adding 10 sun per turn.\n• In addition, row 1 is under pressure (with multiple zombies in column 1 and a zombie–plant combo at column 6). Planting a Peashooter (W) at row 1, column 2 adds extra offensive firepower that will help bring down the cluster in its row.\nBoth moves keep our total cost (50 + 100 = 150) within our available 165 sun, and they offer a balanced boost to our economy and defense at turn 38.","Answer: W 1 3\n\nAnalysis:\nRow1 is currently under heavy assault – its leftmost cell (col0) holds a Sunflower that isn’t an attacker, while several zombies (N, I, R, I) already share that cell.

This extra damage should help slow the zombie’s progress and protect your defenses on the board.\n\nIf you have any questions about the decision or need further explanation, just let me know!","Answer: W 0 3","Answer: J 0 4","Answer: W 0 1","Answer: W 0 2\n\nI’ve chosen to plant a Peashooter (W) on row 0, column 2. This placement helps bolster our defense in the row where a Roadblock Zombie is already present (in cell [0,4] alongside a Wall‐nut). The Peashooter will contribute its 1 damage per turn to help wear down the oncoming threat while our existing plants continue to generate sun and fight.","Answer: J 2 4\n\nI recommend placing a Wall‑nut (J) in row 2, column 4. This cell only contains the Regular Zombie (N) but no plant, so it’s available for planting. By doing so, the Wall‑nut—with its high 10 HP—will serve as an effective blocker. The peashooter already in row 2 at column 3 can continue attacking the zombie from behind, while the Wall‑nut will force the zombie to target it first. This helps delay the zombie’s advance and preserves the peashooter’s firing capability for future turns.","Answer: W 4 6\n\nI decided to use our 130 sun to plant a Peashooter (W) in row 4, column 6. Here’s my reasoning:\n\n• Currently row 4 has only a Sunflower at col0 while a Roadblock zombie (R, 8 HP) occupies col6. Without a shooting plant nearer the right side, the zombie isn’t slowed down by firepower until it eventually reaches the lone sunflower.\n• A Peashooter costs 100 sun, which is affordable with our 130 sun and leaves us with 30 sun.\n• By placing the Peashooter right in col6 (where no plant exists even though the zombie is present), it will be immediately in the path of the advancing zombie and start dealing 1 damage per turn. Although the zombie is a Roadblock type (with higher HP), every bit of damage helps slow its progress.\n• This move should help buy time while we wait to generate more sun and plan additional defenses in the coming turns.\n\nThus, the command is: \"Answer: W 4 6\".","行和列必须为整数。","Answer: W 4 3;J 4 4;X 1 2","Answer: W 4 2\n\nAnalysis:\nWith 110 sun available, a good defensive move is to reinforce the row that already shows a zombie threat. In row4 the Roadblock Zombie (R) is already present alongside a Wall-nut (J) at column 4. Planting a Peashooter (W) in row4 on an empty cell (here, column 2) helps add extra ranged damage on that row. The Peashooter will shoot at the first zombie in row4 each turn, increasing the chance to wear down the zombie’s HP before it eats through the blocking plant. This move costs 100 sun (leaving 10 sun remaining) while addressing the immediate risk on that row.","Answer: W 2 2","Answer: W 4 5","Answer: J 0 5","Answer: W 1 3\n\nI decide to plant a Peashooter in row 1, column 3. Row 1 already has several Sunflowers (which are useful for sun‐generation), but they don’t attack. By adding a Peashooter there, I bolster the row’s defensive capability in anticipation of the next zombie waves (especially since a new zombie spawns soon). This move costs 100 sun, leaving us with 40 sun for now, and it spreads our defensive firepower more evenly across the board.","Answer: H 4 6","Answer: J 2 4","Answer: W 4 5;X 1 4\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n• In row 4 the zombie is already present (a Roadblock zombie “R” with its partnering Wall‐nut “J”), and the Torch Stump “H” in column 6 can boost the damage of a plant immediately to its left. Planting a Peashooter (“W”) in row 4, column 5 will get the extra +1 damage, helping to take this threat down more quickly.\n\n• With 150 sun available, spending 100 sun on the boosted Peashooter leaves exactly 50 sun. Planting a Sunflower (“X”)—which not only costs 50 sun but also adds to your economy through its extra sun generation—is a safe and useful addition. I placed it in row 1, column 4 (an empty cell) because that row is currently unoccupied by zombies and it helps build future sun production.\n\nThus, the moves are:\n – W 4 5  (100 sun)\n – X 1 4  (50 sun)\n\nThis uses all your available sun for the turn while addressing both immediate defense (with the boosted W) and long‐term economy (with the X).","Answer: W 1 5","Answer: W 2 1\n\nExplanation:\nWith 110 sun available on turn 27 and zombies already present in rows 1 and 2, the priority is to increase our firepower in the rows under immediate threat. Row2 has two zombies—one high‐attack zombie (I) at col4 (sharing with a Wall‑nut “J”) and a Roadblock zombie (R) at col5—that are slowly closing in. Although we have a peashooter already at col2 and col3 in row2, additional offensive support early in the row (using a 100‑sun Peashooter “W”) increases the damage output against these advancing enemies before they can do significant harm.\n\nRow2, col1 is empty and is to the left of the zombies in col4 and col5, so a newly planted Peashooter there will “see” and target the approaching zombie (remember, in our simulation, plants target the first zombie in their row, so positioning them left of the threat is ideal).\n\nThus, spending 100 sun on a Peashooter at row 2, column 1 is a timely defensive measure while keeping a little sun for the future.","I'm going to add an extra shooter to bolster row1’s firepower. Notice that in row1 the only attacking plant is the Peashooter at column 3, and there are two Bucket Zombies (each with 12 HP) currently at column 5. Their combined damage in later turns can easily destroy the low‐HP Sunflowers (which occupy columns 0–2 and 4) as they advance. Adding another shooter in that row will help deliver additional damage before the zombies get too close.\n\nSince we have 115 sun this turn, we can afford a Peashooter (W) for 100 sun. I’ll place it in row1 at column 6 (the only empty cell in that row). Even though its projectiles reach overall the row (it always targets the first zombie in its row), its extra damage will help take down those Bucket Zombies faster.\n\nTherefore, the move is:\n\nAnswer: W 1 6","Answer: W 2 6","Answer: H 2 4","Answer: X 0 6","","Answer: W 1 3; H 1 4","Answer: J 1 6","Answer: W 1 2\n\nAnalysis:\nRow1 currently has a sunflower in column 0 and a cell in column 1 that already contains a sunflower with two Bucket Zombies. The fast‐advancing bucket zombies in that cell are a concern since the sunflower cannot shoot. Although there is a Peashooter in column 3, its damage may not be enough to hold the threat coming from column 1. Planting an additional Peashooter in the empty cell at row1, column2 increases the row’s total DPS, helping to target those zombies before they further damage the sunflower. This defensive boost should help delay the zombies’ progress while your sunflowers build up your sun supply, keeping you in a good position as the game continues.","Answer: J 1 5;W 1 4\n\nHere’s the reasoning:\n\n• In row 1 the zombies look especially problematic. Two Bucket zombies (B, 12 HP each) are already at col 1, and additional foes (a High-Attack “I” in col 3 and both a Roadblock “R” and another “I” accompanying the Wall‐nut “J” in col 6) mean that extra DPS and an extra buffer could slow their advance.\n\n• By placing a Wall‐nut (J, 50 sun, 10 HP) at row 1, column 5, we add an additional barrier so that once the zombies from col 6 or further left reach a plant, they must first focus on this new “J” before damaging the other plants.\n\n• Adding a Peashooter (W, 100 sun, 2 HP, 1 damage per turn) at row 1, column 4 boosts the defensive firepower. Though a peashooter always targets the first (left‐most) zombie in its row, more DPS accelerates the elimination of that initial bucket pair (each needing 12 points of damage) so the advancing horde can be handled more efficiently.\n\n• The combined cost is 50 + 100 = 150 sun, which is within the available 175 sun.\n\nThese moves should help to delay and thin out the zombie forces in row 1, improving the defense as the game continues.","Answer: W 2 3","Answer: J 3 3","Answer: W 1 1\n\nI recommend planting a Peashooter (W) in row 1, column 1.

With our current sun (50), this is the only plant we can afford at turn 4.

Although we’re facing a zombie in row 2 and row 3, our current sun total (85) doesn’t allow for an attacking plant like a Peashooter (W, 100 sun). Adding a Sunflower now will boost our sun production (+10 per turn) so that we can afford more offensive plants in upcoming turns. Since zombies target the rightmost (blocking) plants in their lane—in row 3 the Wall-nut (J) at column 5 is already blocking—placing the Sunflower at column 0 won’t immediately put it in harm’s way.","Answer: W 3 4","Answer: J 4 5\n\nAnalysis:\nWe currently have 85 sun on turn 9 and only low‐cost options are affordable (Sunflower or Wall‐nut, each costing 50 sun). Although Sunflowers boost our economy, the more urgent need is to slow down an imminent zombie spawn. Notice that rows 2 and 3 are already “occupied” by plants and even have zombies partially engaged: row2 has a Wall‐nut (J) with a zombie (N) at col4, and row3 has a Peashooter (W) at col4 with a Wall‐nut\/zombie combo (“JN”) at col5. However, row4 is otherwise unguarded except for its far‐left Sunflower at col0—which, having only 2 HP, won’t hold off a newly spawned zombie for long.\n\nSince new zombies spawn every 5 turns (with turn 10 coming up) and they emerge from the far right, it is important to delay any potential threat in row4. Planting a Wall‑nut (J) in row4 at column 5 creates a barrier that a zombie spawning at column 6 would encounter on its first move. The wall‑nut’s 10 HP should stall the zombie long enough until further support (or sun income to afford an attacking plant) becomes available.\n\nThus, with 50 sun spent on a Wall‑nut, we remain with 35 sun for the turn, and the defense in row4 is improved.\n\nTherefore, the move is:\nAnswer: J 4 5","Answer: W 2 3","Answer: J 0 5\n\nI recommend placing a Wall‑nut at row 0, column 5.

Without a defender, that zombie would continue advancing toward our non‐attacking Sunflower in the far left, leaving us vulnerable later on. The Wall‑nut’s 10 HP will give us more time for our attacking plants (like the Peashooters already in row 2 and 3) to thin out the menace before they can reach our key sun producers.","Answer: W 1 4","Answer: J 0 4","Answer: W 0 3\n\nExplanation:\nWith 110 sun available and the imminent threat posed by the Roadblock zombie (R) in row 0 (currently stalling a Wall‐nut at col4–col5), adding attacking power is critical. The peashooter (W) for 100 sun will begin chipping away at the zombie’s 8 HP each turn, hopefully eliminating it before it can break through and start eating the less-defended sunflower behind it. Placing the new peashooter in row 0 at column 3 (an empty cell, to the left of the zombie) ensures that it will target the first (and in this case, only) zombie in that row, thereby providing added support to stop the advancing Roadblock zombie.","Answer: J 1 3","Answer: X 2 1","Answer: W 1 6\n\nAnalysis:\nWe’re on turn 17 with 145 sun available, and several zombies are already present on the board—including a regular zombie (N) in row1 (at column 5) that is soon to be a bigger threat. In row1 the only plant initially is a Sunflower (X) at column 0 and a “JR” (a Wall‐nut “J” sheltering a Roadblock zombie “R”) at column 3. Since incoming zombies generally come from the far‐right, adding an extra offensive plant in row1 can help slow or eliminate the threat before they stack up. \n\nPlanting a Peashooter (W) costs 100 sun and immediately begins dealing 1 damage per turn (and is effective regardless of whether it is to the right or left of other plants in that row). By placing it at row1, column 6 (an empty cell at the rightmost end of the row), it will be well positioned to target the “first zombie” in row1 as soon as shooting occurs. This both supplements your existing plants and helps deal with the zombie “N” and any other incoming threats in that lane.\n\nWith your remaining sun, you can build up economy later – but for now, fortifying row1 is the most urgent need.","I recommend bolstering firepower in row 1. One of your lanes already faces two zombies (a Roadblock (“R”) attached to a Wall‑nut and a Regular (“N”)) in row 1 and the peashooter currently in that row sits very far right. By planting a new Peashooter to the left of those zombies (for example, at column 2 in row 1), you’ll have a shooter that immediately targets the advancing threat. This move costs 100 sun (leaving you with 30 sun for next turns) and should help slow the zombies’ progress.\n\nAnswer: W 1 2","Answer: W 1 1\n\nI recommend planting a Peashooter in row 1, column 1. This additional shooter will help deal extra damage to the advancing zombies (especially the ones already threatening row 1 in column 3) earlier in the row. Given that you have 115 sun, spending 100 sun to add extra firepower now is a good defensive step when zombies have already reached relatively advanced positions in that row, while also preserving some sun for upcoming turns.","Answer: W 4 4","Answer: X 2 2","Answer: W 0 1\n\nI'll explain my reasoning briefly:\n\nAt turn 22 you have 130 sun and face some urgent threats – notably, row0 carries a dangerous cluster (a Roadblock, Regular, and Bucket zombie) at column 5. Although row0 already has a peashooter at column 3, its single damage per turn is unlikely to overcome the combined 24‐HP worth of zombies before the wall‐nut at column 4 eventually gives in. By planting an additional Peashooter (W, costing 100 sun) on row0 in an empty cell (column 1 is free), you add another instance of offensive fire each turn. All peashooters in the row independently target the “first zombie” so the damage output doubles (2 damage\/tick), which should help thin the zombie cluster more quickly.\n\nWith the remaining 30 sun you won’t be able to plant anything else this turn, but bolstering row0 is the most time‐sensitive move.\n\nThus, the move is:\n W 0 1","Answer: H 0 2\n\nI recommend using your entire 125 sun this turn to plant a Torch Stump in row 0, column 2. Here’s why:\n\n• Row 0 already has a Peashooter (W) in column 1. When you place the Torch Stump (H) immediately to its right, its effect immediately increases that peashooter’s damage by +1 (from 1 to 2 damage per turn).\n\n• Your row‑0 already faces a significant threat: the cell in column 4 contains a wall‑nut (J) along with multiple zombies (a Roadblock [R], a Regular [N], and a Bucket Zombie [B]). The Bucket Zombie in particular has 12 HP and will require extra firepower. Boosting the nearby peashooter should help eliminate these zombies faster before they advance further.\n\n• Using all 125 sun on this Torch Stump is viable since none of your other options (such as planting a new Peashooter or Wall‑nut) would use your available funds as effectively in countering the immediate danger.\n\nThus, the move “H 0 2” both improves your defensive\/offensive capability on the threatened row and uses your resources optimally at turn 23.","Answer: J 1 4\n\nI recommend planting a Wall‑nut (J) at row 1, column 4. In row1 the only zombie (a regular zombie “N” at column 5) is already advancing toward our defenses. By placing a Wall‑nut immediately to its left, we create an extra barrier to stall its progress and give our pea shooters more time to chip away at its HP. This defensive block will help protect the valuable plants behind it while buying time to build up sun production or add more powerful defenses later on.","Answer: W 0 5","I'll add a Peashooter to bolster the damage in row 2. With a Bucket Zombie sitting in row2 col6 (with 12 HP) and the only damage in that lane coming from the lone Peashooter at col3, adding another shooter at col5 will help to chip away its health faster. This move uses 100 sun, which is affordable (you have 135 sun now), and reinforces the defense exactly where it’s needed. \n\nAnswer: W 2 5","Answer: J 4 5","I'd like to increase the firepower on the row with the tough Bucket zombie. Notice that in row2 the Bucket zombie (B) in column5 (sharing the cell with a Peashooter) has 12 HP. The Peashooter in row2 column3 is currently only dealing 1 damage per turn—which won’t remove the threat quickly enough. By spending 125 sun to plant a Torch Stump (H) in row2 column4 (an empty cell immediately to the right of the Peashooter), that nearby W would have its damage buffed by +1 (making it deal 2 damage each turn). In six turns the Peashooter could deal 12 total damage—which would neutralize the Bucket zombie more reliably.\n\nThis move costs 125 sun and leaves us with exactly 50 sun for now. Given the immediate pressure from the Bucket zombie in row2, this seems the best way to reinforce our defense.\n\nAnswer: H 2 4","Answer: X 1 6;X 3 6","Based on the current board and knowing that slower‐dying plants are critical when zombies have already advanced, the most urgent threat is along row 4. There the lone Peashooter at (4,4) is already “under fire” from the zombies marked “R” and “I” in cell (4,5). (Recall that all zombies in a row “lock on” to the first plant encountered moving from right‐to‐left.) If nothing is done, the shooter will take hits from a Roadblock zombie and a High‐Attack zombie—and both can reduce its 2 HP before it can take it down with its 1 damage normally.\n\nOne good way to help is to plant a Wall‑nut (“J”) right at (4,5). Although there are zombies there already, the game rules allow planting on a cell occupied solely by zombies (only one plant per cell is allowed). In doing so the new Wall‑nut (with 10 HP) becomes the barrier. The zombies in (4,5) will then “focus” on that Wall‑nut (and deal 1 damage each turn, regardless of type—even High‑Attack zombies, which only ramp up damage when directly attacking a plant blocking their way) instead of attacking the valuable Peashooter behind it at (4,4). This extra protection buys time for the shooter to whittle down the attackers (and note that if you ever find yourself a bit short on immediate defense, you could later consider “boosting” a shooter’s damage by placing a Torch Stump (H) immediately to its right—but here preserving the shooter by giving it a dedicated barrier is paramount).\n\nBecause a Wall‑nut costs only 50 sun—and you have 160 sun available—you can safely invest in this additional defense.\n\nSo the move would be:\n\nAnswer: J 4 5","Answer: W 3 1;H 3 2\n\nI’ve decided to invest the entire 225 sun this turn in a boosted offense on row 3.

Row 3 already faces a tough mix of zombies (including a Regular, a High‐Attack and a Roadblock in column 6, and a Bucket Zombie causing trouble in column 5), so enhancing firepower on that row should help thin the attacking horde earlier before they get too close.","Answer: W 1 5","Answer: J 3 3\n\nI’ve decided to plant a Wall‑nut (J) at row 3, column 3.

With the mixed cluster of zombies (including the Bucket, Normal, High‑Attack, and Roadblock types) already in row 3 at column 4, giving that plant an extra point of damage should help it take down the front‐line zombie faster, potentially stalling the wave long enough until later turns and additional sun allows for further defenses.","Answer: W 2 4\n\nExplained Reasoning:\n• I noticed that rows 2 and 4 are vulnerable because they lack an attacking plant. In row2 the Bucket Zombie (B) sits in col3 with 12 HP, and its slow damage (1 per turn) could let it take down our sunflowers before being eliminated.\n• With 125 sun available, a Peashooter (W) costing 100 sun is an efficient choice—it’ll add extra firepower to chip away at the Bucket Zombie.\n• I selected row2 because bolstering row2’s defenses means the Peashooter will always target the first (leftmost) zombie in that row (the Bucket Zombie), helping to reduce its HP steadily.\n• I placed the Peashooter in an empty cell at column 4 (row2) so that even though the zombie is in col3, our shooter in col4 will still “see” it and start dealing damage.\n\nThus, the move is: W 2 4.","Answer: W 4 1\n\nI’ve decided to use 100 sun to plant a Peashooter in row 4, column 1.

Therefore, I won’t plant anything on this turn.","操作格式错误，应为：植物类型 行 列","Answer: J 2 4","Answer: X 1 0","Answer: X 0 0","Answer: X 3 0\n\nRationale:\nYou currently have 55 sun available, so you can only afford a plant costing no more than 55 sun. The Sunflower (X) costs 50 and provides an additional 10 sun per turn, which is valuable for building resources early on. Placing it in row 3 (at column 0) puts it in an empty row where it won’t be immediately threatened by zombies, helping boost your sun income for future, more expensive defensive or attacking plants.","Answer: J 0 5","Answer: X 4 0\n\nI suggest planting a Sunflower in row 4, column 0. This not only uses sun within our current budget (50 sun out of 85) but also increases our economy by giving an extra 10 sun each turn. With more sun available in future turns, we’ll have more options for both defense and offense as the zombies advance.","Answer: W 2 3","Answer: X 2 2\n\nI’ve chosen to plant an extra Sunflower in row 2, column 2. This costs 50 sun (leaving 35 sun), and because there’s already a wall‐nut with a zombie in row 2 at column 4 and a Peashooter at column 3 backing it up, the new sunflower won’t immediately be the front “blocking” plant. Instead, it will safely boost your sun income for upcoming turns, helping you eventually afford a Peashooter upgrade or other, stronger plants to better deal with the advancing zombies.","Based on the situation, we’re a bit exposed in row0. Although row0 does have a wall‐nut (J) in col5 already (with a zombie sharing the cell), that wall‐nut “blocks” the zombie but isn’t doing anything to damage it. Meanwhile the only plant in row0 is a sunflower at col0 that is too far behind to help with offense. By adding a Peashooter (W) in the same row and placing it to the left of the zombie (so that its own shooting arc reaches the zombie coming from the right) it will start chipping away at that zombie’s HP while the zombie continues trying to “eat” the blocking wall‐nut. \n\nPlacing a Peashooter in row0, column4 appears optimal—its shot will hit the zombie at col5 (even though the wall‐nut there is still the front barrier, plants shoot regardless of intervening blockers). This spending costs 100 sun (leaving 20 sun), which is acceptable given our current sun of 120. \n\nThus, the recommended move is:\n\nAnswer: W 0 4","Answer: W 3 1","Answer: J 1 4\n\nI’m choosing to use 50 sun to plant a Wall‐nut (J) in row1, column4. By doing so, we now add a blocker to the otherwise unprotected row1 (which currently has only a fragile Sunflower at column0). This wall‐nut—with its 10 HP—will absorb the hits from any zombie that might spawn in row1 on turn15, slowing its progress and giving us time to build up our offense (for example, eventually adding a shooter when affordable). This defensive reinforcement follows the pattern seen in other rows (for instance, row0 now has a Peashooter in col4 and a Wall‐nut in col5, and row2 already has a Peashooter and a Wall‐nut), helping to balance our board as we progress through the game.","Answer: J 3 3; X 4 1","Answer: W 3 2","Answer: W 4 5\n\nI'm choosing to add a Peashooter (W) to row 4, column 5. Row 4 currently only has Sunflowers, which gather sun but don’t help with attack. Placing a Peashooter there will provide needed offensive support against future zombie spawns in that lane. At a cost of 100 sun, it leaves us with 15 sun remaining, which is acceptable at this stage (with our turn‐gain of at least 25 sun per turn plus our existing sun-producing Sunflowers).","Answer: W 1 3","Answer: W 0 3\n\nI'll explain briefly: We’re facing an immediate threat in row 0 where a zombie is already sharing cell (0,4) with a peashooter (W). With only 105 sun available, we can’t afford a more expensive plant. Planting another Peashooter—and doing so in an empty cell toward the left (here, column 3 on row 0) so that it immediately helps in shooting the advancing zombie—gives us extra damage output this turn without overspending our sun.","Answer: X 2 1","Answer: H 0 4\n\nI propose placing a Torch Stump (H) at row 0, column 4. This will buff the Peashooter already at row 0, column 3 to deal 2 damage per turn against the zombie (N) in row 0. With our current sun of 155, spending 125 leaves enough for future actions, and increasing the firepower in row 0 can help eliminate the advancing zombie sooner.","Answer: H 4 6\n\nExplanation:\nIt seems wise on turn 20 to boost one of our front‐line shooting plants before the increased challenges that come with zombie spawns. In our board, row4 already has a Peashooter at column 5 but no immediate support. By spending 125 sun to plant a Torch Stump at row4, column 6, we can increase that Peashooter’s damage (its left‐neighbor) by +1—from 1 to 2 damage per turn. Although this leaves us with only 10 sun remaining, the extra damage can help us better counter the new zombie that spawns (especially since after turn 20 tougher zombies—Bucket or High-Attack types—might appear). This decision balances resource management with proactive defense.","Answer: J 0 5;X 2 6","Answer: W 4 4\n\nI’ve decided to bolster row4’s firepower. Right now row4 has a peashooter at column5 that’s boosted by the Torch Stump in column6—but the bucket zombie (with its high HP) threatening that lane is especially dangerous because the Torch Stump is very fragile. By spending 100 sun to plant an extra Peashooter in the empty cell at row4, column4, we add another source of damage that will shoot the first zombie in that row every turn. This extra damage should help knock down the bucket zombie more quickly before it can break through—even if the booster (H) dies soon from its 2 HP.\n\nWe still stay within our 130 sun budget.\n\nFeel free to offer any follow‐up instructions if needed!","Based on the current board state at turn 23—with sun at 145 and a dangerous Bucket Zombie (B) on row 4 at column 6—the best priority is to shore up the defense on row 4. Although two Peashooters already occupy row 4 at columns 4 and 5, the Bucket Zombie (with 12 HP) will likely require extra if it eventually forces its way past its current blocker.\n\nA good plan is to add another attacking unit further to the left (yet still in the same row) so that—even though the zombie will continue to attack the right‐most plant—the additional damage from another shooter will help lower the zombie’s HP faster, giving your other plants more time to do their work. Placing a Peashooter (W, costing 100 sun) at row 4, column 3 is ideal; it won’t interfere with your existing plants and will contribute to the row’s overall DPS without immediately drawing the zombie’s attention.\n\nTherefore, the move is:\n\nAnswer: W 4 3","Answer: W 4 2","Answer: H 4 6;X 1 2\n\nHere's the reasoning behind the decision:\n\n• Row4 already hosts a Peashooter in column 5 that’s facing a tough Bucket Zombie (B). By placing a Torch Stump (H) in row4, column 6, it will boost that Peashooter’s damage (+1), hopefully helping to eliminate the 12‐HP threat more effectively.\n\n• With exactly 175 sun available this turn, after spending 125 for H you’re left with 50 sun. Planting a Sunflower (X) for 50 sun—say in row1 at column 2 (an empty, safe spot)—will increase your sun income by an extra 10 sun per turn in future rounds.\n\nThis combination uses all available resources while both reinforcing heavy firepower on a row with a formidable zombie and boosting your economy for later turns.\n\nGood luck in your next turn!","I'll use the remaining sun to add extra firepower in row2, where a high‐attack zombie (“I”) is already sharing cell col6 with a sunflower. Placing a Peashooter in row2 (using one of the empty cells, in col5) will help chip away at that dangerous foe before it can do more damage. (Remember, a Peashooter costs 100 sun, leaving you with 25 sun.) \n\nAnswer: W 2 5","Answer: X 1 1;W 3 4\n\nI'll explain my reasoning briefly:\n\n• In row3 a powerful Bucket zombie (B, 12 HP) is advancing, and while there is a Wall‑nut at col3, adding another shooter immediately to that row (at col4) will increase damage output on the threatening zombie. A Peashooter (W) at row3, col4 (cost 100 sun) can help chip away its health as it advances.\n\n• With the remaining 50 sun, planting a Sunflower (X) in a safe row (row1, col1) boosts our long‑term sun production by generating an additional 10 sun per turn. \n\nThis balanced action uses all 150 sun while addressing both immediate defense and future resource needs.","I recommend using your entire sun on a Torch Stump in row 2, column 6. That will immediately buff the peashooter already in row 2 (in col 5, albeit co‐located with a high‐attack zombie) so it deals an extra damage each turn. With the high‐attack zombie (type I) already in that cell—and given its tendency to one‐shot a normal peashooter—the buff may be crucial in whittling its HP down more quickly before it can finish off the plant. \n\nSince a Torch Stump costs exactly 125 sun, it’s an all‐in on defense for this row rather than broadening your economy (for which you’d plant sunflowers). In the heat of battle with upgraded zombies attacking on multiple rows, a timely boost to your offensive firepower might be the difference between holding the line or losing a key shooter.\n\nAnswer: H 2 6","Answer: H 3 5\n\nAnalyzing the situation on turn 29 you have 125 sun available. In row3 the bucket zombie (B) in column 4 is the most health‐heavy (12 HP) and is facing your only shooting plant (a peashooter at column 4, already blocked by a wall‐nut at column 3) with support from two additional peashooters at columns 1 and 2. By planting a Torch Stump (H) in row 3 at column 5 (an empty cell), you boost the peashooter immediately to its left – increasing its damage from 1 to 2. This extra damage per turn can help bring down the bucket zombie faster before the next zombie spawn, especially since on turn 30 you’ll face 2 newly spawned zombies with their boosted HP. \n\nHence, the move “H 3 5” uses your full sun to strengthen your defenses where it’s needed most.","Answer: J 2 5; X 1 5","Answer: H 4 6","Answer: J 3 4;W 3 6\n\nI’d like to explain the thinking briefly. In turn 32 with 170 sun available the most immediate concern is the high‐damage threat in row 3: the cell at (3,5) already holds a Torch Stump with a High‐Attack Zombie (I), which will deal 3 damage per turn to its blocking plant. To slow that zombie’s progress and give our row’s shooters extra time to chip away its health, it makes sense to “stall” it by planting a Wall‐nut (J) in the cell immediately to its left (row 3, column 4). This barrier (10 HP) will absorb damage over a few turns. \n\nWith the Wall‐nut in place, we also want to increase the row’s overall firepower so that the zombie’s eventual attacks can be countered more quickly. Planting a Peashooter (W) at (3,6) puts another damage dealer on the same row. Even though the zombie currently in (3,5) is in front (and is the “first” zombie in the row), once it eventually tries to break through the barrier our extra shooter may help reduce its HP faster.\n\nThe two actions cost 50 (for J) + 100 (for W) = 150 sun, leaving a small remainder while focusing immediately on a critical row without compromising our future sun production options.\n\nThus, the chosen move is:\n  Wall‐nut at row 3, column 4 and Peashooter at row 3, column 6.","Answer: J 0 2;W 0 4","Answer: H 4 5\n\nExplained reasoning:\n• Observing the board at turn 34 with 140 sun, row4 shows an urgent situation—the peashooter at column 4 is now facing a Roadblock zombie and two regular zombies.\n• Planting a Torch Stump (H) in row4 column 5 (an empty cell) will buff the peashooter immediately to its left, increasing its damage by +1.\n• This boost could help clear the threat in row4 faster without overspending sun.\n• With H costing 125 sun, the remaining 15 sun keeps you in a manageable position for future turns.","I’ll help bolster your defenses. Notice that row4 is already under pressure—with zombies already present in cells 3–4 and a future spawn likely landing in the far‐right cell (col6). Placing a Wall‐nut (J, 50 sun) at row4 col6 will immediately block any newly spawned zombie and help delay the advance in that vulnerable row.\n\nThus, I recommend:\n\nAnswer: J 4 6","Answer: X 0 1;W 2 4","Answer: W 3 5;H 3 6","Answer: H 4 3\n\nAnalysis:\nLooking at the battlefield, row4 is concerning. In row4 the cell at column2 (with a Peashooter “W”) is currently sharing its space with two regular zombies (“N”), and that shooter is being heavily targeted. Boosting its firepower is key to helping clear the zombies before they overrun the lane. Placing a Torch Stump (“H”) immediately to the right (in the empty cell at row4, column3) will buff the shooter in column2—adding +1 extra damage (from 1 to 2 damage per turn). Although the cost is 125 sun, it leaves you with 25 sun, which is okay given that you gain at least 25 sun each turn. This extra damage might just be what row4 needs to survive the upcoming turns and halt the zombie pressure.\n\nFeel free to ask if you’d like more details or a different strategy!","Answer: X 0 5;X 0 6\n\nI’ve chosen to plant two Sunflowers in row 0 (columns 5 and 6). Row 0 is clear of zombies and already has sunflowers and peashooters protecting it. Adding more Sunflowers there will boost our sun income (an extra 10 sun each turn) so that we can afford stronger defenses in upcoming turns.

Because row0 has no shooter to whittle down that zombie—and because we don’t want the zombie to eventually clear the way and attack any future economic installations—it makes sense to buy extra blocking in that row.\n\nBy placing a Wall‑nut (J) to the left of the existing one (for example, in row0 column 3), the zombie will, on its move, step into that new cell and attack the fresh wall‑nut (which has 10 HP). This extra barrier will delay the zombie even further, giving you time to build your sun economy (and later be able to afford a shooter for row0 when you have more sun).\n\nThus, a good move on turn 9 is to plant a Wall‑nut at row0, column 3.\n\nAnswer: J 0 3","Answer: W 0 2","Answer: X 2 3","Answer: W 1 4","Answer: W 4 3","Answer: J 1 5\n\nI suggest placing a Wall‐nut at row 1, column 5.

Since we're in turn 17 with 95 sun available, spending 50 sun to plant a Sunflower not only uses a safe grid cell (row 4 has no current zombie threat) but also boosts our future sun income by providing an extra 10 sun each turn. This increase in economy is critical for affording stronger plants (like Peashooters or even the more expensive Three-Line Shooter or Fire Chili) in subsequent turns, especially given the advancing zombie threat in rows 1–3.","Answer: H 3 5\n\nAnalysis:\nThe row‐3 situation appears most perilous. In row3 the Roadblock Zombie (R) in column 5 has 8 HP and is only being opposed by a lone Peashooter (W) at column 4 that otherwise does 1 damage per turn. By planting a Torch Stump (H) immediately to the right of that Peashooter—in the same row—it will buff the Peashooter’s damage by +1 (making it deal 2 damage per turn). This extra damage should help take down the Roadblock faster before it’s able to rip through the relatively fragile plant (which has only 2 HP).\n\nAlthough row2 also has a Regular Zombie (N) at column 4 and is only “blocked” by a sunflower (X) that does no damage, the immediate threat of the Roadblock in row3 is more pressing because its higher HP and potential to destroy the front-line defensive shooter quickly. With 140 sun currently available, spending 125 for a Torch Stump is a good investment to speed up the defense on row3 (leaving 15 sun in reserve).\n\nRemember that planting is allowed in any grid cell as long as no plant already occupies it—even if a zombie is there. In row3, column 5 the cell contains only the zombie (“R”), so placing the Torch Stump there is valid.","Answer: J 2 2\n\nI decided to shore up the row with the vulnerable sunflower in row2. The sunflower (X) at (2,0) is already in danger because its cell (2,3) is being contested by a zombie. By planting a Wall-nut (J) at row2, column2, it will come between the approaching zombie and the planted sunflower, buying extra time (thanks to the Wall-nut’s 10 HP) for your offense to whittle down the threat.

In row 3 the only plant (a Peashooter at column 4) is currently up against an approaching Regular Zombie at column 5. By adding another peashooter further to the right, both plants in that row can focus on the first zombie, increasing the overall damage output and hopefully holding off its progress until it’s eliminated. This move uses 100 sun, leaving a little extra for future turns to invest in sun or additional defenses.","Answer: X 0 1;J 2 3\n\nAnalysis:\n• With 100 sun available on turn 23, a sound strategy is to invest half in expanding your sun production by planting a Sunflower (X) in a safe spot (row0, column1) and half in beefing up defense.\n• In row2 the zombies already include a High‐Attack (I) and a Bucket (B) zombie alongside a peashooter and a Wall‑nut. Planting an extra Wall‑nut (J, costing 50 sun) at row2, column3 will create an additional barrier to delay these tough zombies. This extra delay can help your shooters whittle down the attackers before they reach your more vulnerable plants.\n• This balanced move simultaneously boosts your sun economy while shoring up immediate defense.\n\nFeel free to adjust tactics based on how zombie pressure develops.","Answer: W 2 5\n\nReasoning:\nLooking at the current board, row2 is under significant pressure with three zombies already present (a Regular Zombie alongside a Wall‑nut in col2, a Bucket Zombie alongside a Wall‑nut in col3, and a High‑Attack Zombie alone in col4). Your existing peashooter in row2 (at col1) is hard‐pressed to deal with all the incoming threats. With 105 sun available, spending 100 sun on an additional Peashooter (W) in row2 (in an empty cell, such as column 5) will boost the damage output in that row—helping to whittle down those advancing zombies faster.

Row 3 already has multiple zombies (one at column 3 alongside an existing Peashooter, and others at columns 5 and 6), so boosting the row’s DPS is essential. The added Peashooter will target the left‐most zombie in that row (currently in the same cell at column 3) every turn, hopefully reducing its HP before it can break through the plant’s defenses. This move also costs just 100 sun, leaving you with a little spare for future moves.","Answer: H 3 4\n\nAnalysis:\nWith 125 sun at turn 28 and noticing that row3 has two peashooters (at col2 and col3) facing a regular zombie (N) at col4 and a high‐attack zombie (I) behind it, it’s a good defensive move to boost one of the peashooters’ damage. Planting a Torch Stump (H) costs exactly 125 sun and—when placed immediately to the right of a plant—its damage bonus (+1) directly increases that plant’s damage. In row3, cell col3 already contains a Peashooter (W). By planting H at row3, col4 (even though a zombie is already there, plants may share a cell with zombies), you boost that peashooter so that it deals 2 damage per turn instead of 1. Combined with the other unboosted peashooter in the same row (which still deals 1 damage), row3 will deal a total of 3 damage per turn to the left‐most zombie. This should help take down the front zombie faster before the threats move too far left.","Answer: W 2 3","Answer: W 0 5","Answer: W 3 4","Answer: W 3 6","I recommend using your sun to put in two inexpensive defensive barriers—wall‐nuts—right in the lanes under immediate pressure. In row2, the zombie (a Bucket Zombie “B”) in column1 is already attacking the lone Sunflower at column0. And in row3 there are already two zombies (a Regular “N” in col1 and a High‐Attack “I” in col2) that are too close for comfort, forcing the far–left Sunflower at col0 to face them alone. By planting a Wall–nut (“J”, 50 sun, 10 HP) in each of those cells (row2 col1 and row3 col1), you “replace” the vulnerable sunflower as the front–line barrier. (Note that it’s allowed to plant in a cell containing only zombies, so these placements are legal.) This way the stronger, 10–HP wall–nuts will force the zombies to spend extra turns attacking a tougher target rather than quickly reaching the Sunflower.\n\nYour total cost is 50+50 = 100 sun (with 25 sun left over), which is a good investment for turn 33 given the growing threat and upcoming zombie spawns.\n\nAnswer: J 2 1;J 3 1","Answer: W 0 5\n\nI’ve decided to add an extra Peashooter in row 0 at column 5. Row 0 already faces multiple zombie threats (a Bucket zombie in the cell with the wall‐nut and a High-Attack zombie nearby) and by planting a Peashooter at (0,5) we can boost the row’s overall damage output. With 130 sun available and a Peashooter costing 100, this move should help keep the incoming zombies under control while keeping sun available for future play.","Answer: W 3 2\n\nI’m planting a Peashooter (W) in row 3, column 2. In row 3 the zombies in cell 1 (currently obstructing the wall‐nut there) are already dangerously far west; an extra peashooter in col2 will add more firepower to help eliminate those advancing foes. This choice uses 100 sun (leaving 35 for now) and strengthens the defense in an area where the wall‐nut might soon be overwhelmed.","Answer: H 3 3\n\nAnalysis:\nOn turn 36 with 140 sun available, the most impactful move is to bolster our defense in a row with active zombie threats. Row 3 is particularly critical – it has a Wall‐nut (J) in column 1 already engaged by a High‐Attack Zombie (I) and a regular zombie (N), and a Peashooter (W) in column 2 that is currently doing only 1 damage per turn. By planting a Torch Stump (H) in row 3, column 3 (an empty cell even though zombies are already present), we can boost the damage of the Peashooter immediately to its left from 1 to 2 damage per turn. This extra damage can help eliminate the blocking zombies faster, delaying their progress toward our more vulnerable plants. The cost of a Torch Stump is 125 sun, which fits within our 140 sun budget.","Answer: W 3 5\n\nI'll plant a Peashooter in row 3, column 5. Row 3 is in a dangerous situation already—the leftmost plant in that row is a fragile Sunflower (X) at column 0 and a Regular Zombie (N) is already in column 1. By adding another Peashooter (W) into row 3, we boost the offensive firepower in that lane. This extra shooter will help target and chip away at the advancing zombie, hopefully eliminating it before it gets a chance to destroy the vulnerable plant at column 0. The cost is 100 sun, which fits within the available 120 sun (leaving 20 sun for now), and it’s a timely defensive move as we continue fighting off the zombie horde in this simplified game.","Answer: W 4 2","Answer: H 0 6\n\nI decided to use your 130 sun to buy a Torch Stump (H) for row0 column6. Here’s my reasoning:\n\n• In row0 the only shooter is your peashooter at col5, and there’s a high‐attack zombie (I, 6 HP, dealing 3 damage) at col2. Because the first (leftmost) plant in that row is a weak sunflower (only 2 HP), that zombie is in danger of quickly breaking through.\n  \n• Planting a Torch Stump immediately to the right of the peashooter (i.e. in row0, col6) will buff that peashooter’s damage by +1 (raising its per–turn damage from 1 to 2). That extra damage should help take the dangerous zombie down a bit sooner before it gets a chance to more seriously harm your production.\n\nThus, with a cost of 125 sun (leaving 5 sun remaining for the turn), “H 0 6” looks like the best tactical choice at turn 39.","Answer: W 2 3","Answer: W 1 5\n\nAnalysis:\nLooking at the board, row1 currently has two Sunflowers (columns 0 and 2) and is facing a pair of zombies (a Roadblock and a Regular Zombie at column 3, and a Bucket plus Roadblock at column 6). Since there aren’t any attacking plants on that row, planting a Peashooter (W) in an empty cell—such as column 5—will allow it to start damaging the approaching zombies before they get too close. At a cost of 100 sun (with 115 sun available) this move is both affordable and timely, hopefully staving off further damage as zombies continue to advance.\n\nTurn:41 | Sun:115 | Score:41","Answer: W 3 2","Answer: W 4 3"],"prompt":"\nIn the following, you are required to participate in a simplified version of the Plants vs. Zombies game.

Once the zombie finishes attacking the current wall, it will then run into the new Wall-nut – buying you extra time to build your sun economy and eventually afford a more offensive plant like a Peashooter.

This move costs 100 sun (within the 125 sun available) and helps provide offensive firepower in the row where zombies are already present. With zombies already in row 3 (a regular zombie riding a wall‑nut at col 5 and a Roadblock zombie in col 6), adding a Peashooter at col 4 will allow it to start dealing damage to the closest zombie (even if that zombie is sharing the cell with a Wall‑nut), helping to whittle down their HP before they can break through your defenses.","Answer: W 3 2\n\nAnalysis:\nThe current threat is in row 3—zombies (a Regular Zombie and two Roadblock Zombies) are attacking the wall‐nut in column 5 while only a single Peashooter in column 4 is helping out with damage. With 110 sun available, planting an extra Peashooter (which costs 100 sun) in row 3 (specifically in an empty cell such as column 2) will add another source of damage. Although the zombies remain blocked by the wall‐nut in column 5 (which they’re attacking), both the existing Peashooter and the new one will each shoot the leading zombie in row 3 every turn, increasing your overall firepower and hopefully eliminating the threat sooner.\n\nThus, the move “W 3 2” (placing a Peashooter at row 3, column 2) is a good choice.","Answer: X 1 2\n\nExplanation:\nWith 95 sun available at turn 13 and only Sunflower (X, cost 50) and Wall-nut (J, cost 50) affordable at this stage, I’ve chosen to boost your sun income. Adding a Sunflower in row 1 at column 2 (an unoccupied cell) will generate an extra 10 sun each turn. Although row 3 is currently seeing zombie activity, your defensive plants there (the peashooters and wall‐nut) should hold for a few turns. Increasing your sun income early will help you afford stronger (and more expensive) plants later as the zombie waves get tougher.","Answer: W 3 3\n\nI’ve chosen to plant a Peashooter in row 3, column 3. This will add another shooter in the lane with the advancing Roadblock zombie (currently at row 3, column 5) so that our row’s overall damage output increases and we can hopefully slow it down before it reaches our more valuable or previously planted defenses.","Answer: H 3 5\n\nAnalysis:\nAt turn 15 we have 135 sun available and a serious threat on row3—note the cell at (3,4) contains a Peashooter along with two Roadblock zombies (R) that have been buffed (their HP increased by +4 since they were spawned after turn 10). Although the normal combined fire from row3’s plants (one at (3,3) shooting 1 damage and the one at (3,4) also shooting 1 damage) might eventually wear down a zombie, their 12 HP (8 base +4 bonus) means it would take several turns before they are eliminated. \n\nBy spending 125 sun to plant a Torch Stump (H) in (3,5) we immediately boost the damage output of the plant directly to its left—that is, the Peashooter at (3,4) now deals an extra 1 damage (for a total of 2 damage per turn). This extra damage can help in taking down the blocking zombies faster. With 10 sun remaining and enough sunflowers already across the field (in rows 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4), this choice supports immediate defense while keeping future sun income robust.\n\nThus, the recommended play is to plant the Torch Stump at row 3, column 5.","Answer: W 2 5\n\nI recommend planting a Peashooter (W) in row 2, column 5. This will immediately help deal damage to the regular zombie currently in row 2 (at column 6) before it can advance further toward your more valuable Sunflower at column 0. Although it costs 100 sun (leaving you with 5 sun this turn), prioritizing defense in row 2 is important so that the 4‐HP Regular Zombie doesn’t breach your defenses.","Answer: W 3 4\n\nI'll plant a Peashooter in row 3, column 4. This should add extra firepower in the row with the dangerous Roadblock zombie (the R in cell 3,3) so that the combined shooting from the existing pea shooter(s) plus the new one hopefully brings the 8‐HP zombie down faster before it can take down our plants.","Answer: J 3 1\n\nI'm choosing to add a Wall‐nut (J) at row 3, column 1. Here’s my thinking:\n\n• With 95 sun available, only the 50‑sun plants (Sunflower or Wall‑nut) are affordable. Since we already have a healthy number of Sunflowers for sun production, and row 3 already has a Peashooter whose 2‑HP won’t last long against the Roadblock zombie (R) sharing its cell in column 3, bolstering defense seems wise.\n\n• Planting a Wall‑nut (with 10 HP) in row 3 at column 1 creates a defensive barrier. Although the Roadblock zombie is currently engaged with the Peashooter in column 3, if that plant falls the zombie will next attack the plant immediately to its left. Having a sturdy Wall‑nut at col 1, rather than letting the vulnerable Sunflower at col 0 be its next target, should buy extra time as the shooters continue dealing damage.\n\nThus, with this move, we aim to delay any breach of the left‐edge and protect our sun-producing plants while our shooters whittle down the zombies’ HP.","Answer: W 2 4\n\nExplanation:\nWe only have 140 sun at the start of turn 19. There’s an incoming Regular Zombie in row2 (currently at column5) that isn’t being attacked, and defensive firepower there is needed before the next zombie spawn on turn 20. Planting a Peashooter (W), costing 100 sun, in row2 (for example at column4, which is unoccupied) will start chipping away at the zombie’s 4 HP each turn. This leaves us with 40 sun for this turn while bolstering row2’s defense, helping us stall the zombie’s advance until further support can be provided on later turns.","Answer: H 2 5\n\nI'll explain my reasoning briefly:\n\n• In row2 the cell at column4 (“WN”) already has your Peashooter (W) that’s currently blocking (and shooting at) the regular zombie (N). Since that zombie has 4 HP and your unmodified Peashooter only does 1 damage per turn, it risks outlasting your plant’s 2 HP.  \n• By placing a Torch Stump (H) immediately to its right (row2, column5), you boost the Peashooter’s damage by 1 (up to 2 damage per turn), speeding up the elimination of that zombie before it can destroy your plant.  \n• This move costs 125 sun, which is within your current 135 sun—and it’s an effective defensive boost at turn 20.\n\nThus, I recommend: Answer: H 2 5","Answer: W 1 3\n\nAnalysis:\nSince it’s turn 21 with 105 sun available and row1 already has several Sunflowers but also a zombie (N) at the far right (col6), adding a Peashooter (costs 100 sun) in that row will help start chipping away at the threat. Placing it at an empty cell like row1, column3 (immediately to the right of the existing Sunflowers) maximizes its potential to hit the advancing zombie each turn. This choice uses our sun budget effectively while increasing our offensive capabilities in the row that appears most at risk.","Answer: W 4 4","Answer: X 0 1\n\nI recommend using 50 sun to plant an extra Sunflower in row 0, column 1. At turn 23 your economy is a bit tight with only 95 sun available, and although some rows already contain zombies, your existing defenders (the Peashooters already on threatened rows) should hold off the small Regular Zombie(s) for a few turns. Adding a Sunflower to row 0—which is currently safe—will ramp up your sun production by 10 per turn so that in the upcoming turns you’ll be able to afford more expensive—and more offensive—plants when needed to help stop the zombies.","Answer: W 4 1;X 0 2","Answer: X 0 3;J 1 4\n\nExplanation:\n• We’re at turn 25 with 115 sun. In row0 (which is currently safe) we plant a Sunflower (X) at column 3 for an extra 10 sun per turn to boost our future economy.\n• In row1 the zombie is already contesting our peashooter (W) at col3. By planting a Wall‑nut (J) at col4, we put a tougher barrier (10 HP) as the first blocking plant in that row—distracting the attacker and protecting the more valuable shooter behind it.\nThis move costs 50 sun for the sunflower and 50 sun for the wall‑nut (total 100 sun), leaving us with 15 sun while simultaneously strengthening both our economy and defense.","Based on the board’s current situation, the row that looks most in need of reinforcement is row 1. In that row (with cells 0–6), you already have your sunflowers in columns 0–2 and a Wall‑nut at column 4. However, zombies are already present in this row—including a High‑Attack zombie (I) that deals 3 damage and a Regular zombie (N). Although the Wall‑nut can absorb some damage, adding another attacker can help thin the zombie health before they get too close. \n\nUsing 100 sun for a Peashooter (W) placed at row 1, column 5 will immediately add an extra source of damage in that row. With turn 26 having 140 sun available, spending 100 to plant a Peashooter in row 1, column 5 seems like the best defensive move, while still leaving you with 40 sun for upcoming turns.\n\nAnswer: W 1 5","Answer: H 1 6","Answer: W 1 3\n\nI’ve chosen to plant a Peashooter in row 1 at column 3. Row 1 is under significant pressure—with a Regular Zombie already sitting with your Sunflower in column 2 and a High‐Attack Zombie appearing in column 5, adding a Peashooter right in the middle will help dish out extra damage earlier, reducing the threat before the zombies can advance further. This move costs 100 sun (leaving you with 65 sun), which seems like a good balance between strengthening your defense and your long‐term sun production (since you already have several Sunflowers in other rows).","Answer: W 1 5;X 2 1\n\nI recommend placing a Peashooter (W) at row 1, column 5. This will take immediate aim at the row 1 zombies—and because the cell to its right (row 1, column 6) already holds a Torch Stump (H), this new Peashooter will have its damage buffed from 1 to 2. With the combined firepower from the existing Peashooter at (1,3) and the new, buffed one at (1,5), row 1 should be able to deal with the advancing zombies more effectively.\n\nIn addition, with the remaining sun (90 sun left after spending 100 for the Peashooter), we can invest in economy for later turns. Planting a Sunflower (X) in an empty cell—such as row 2, column 1—costs 50 sun, and will add an extra 10 sun per turn. This extra income will be helpful in affording costlier plants when heavier waves arrive.\n\nThus, the move “W 1 5;X 2 1” uses 150 sun (100 for W and 50 for X) and leaves a small remainder while strengthening both the defense on row 1 and the economy overall.","Answer: H 4 3","Answer: W 0 5\n\nAnalysis: Row0 is particularly vulnerable since its only plants are sun-producing Sunflowers (with low HP) and it faces a pair of Roadblock Zombies (R) at column 6. By spending 100 sun on a Peashooter (W) at row0, column5 (an empty cell), you immediately add a ranged defender to target those advancing zombies before they reach the Sunflowers. This helps alleviate the immediate pressure on your sun income while preserving your board’s overall defense, and the remaining sun can be saved for future moves.","Answer: H 0 6;J 4 4","Answer: W 0 4","Answer: H 2 5\n\nI decided to buff the peashooter that is already fighting the dangerous zombies in row 2. By placing a Torch Stump (H) at row 2, column 5, the adjacent peashooter (in column 4) will have its damage increased by 1—from 1 to 2 per turn—which should help it better handle both the regular zombie (N) and the high‐attack zombie (I) sharing that cell. At a cost of 125 sun, this move uses part of our available 165 sun while keeping resources in reserve for later turns.","Answer: W 2 2\n\nI recommend planting a Peashooter in row 2, column 2.

Placing a Peashooter at (2,2) means it will start shooting at the first enemy in row 2—the “I” in col3—and help chip away its HP before it can do too much damage. This move costs 100 sun (with 165 available), leaving enough sun for future actions on later turns.","Answer: W 0 5","Answer: J 4 0;W 2 6","Answer: W 2 2\n\nI'm choosing to add an extra Peashooter in row2 at column 2.

With only one Peashooter at col6 already firing, adding another one closer (at col2) should boost the row’s DPS against those advancing threats.

That cell is empty and safe—there are no zombies there—and adding an extra sunflower will boost our sun production by 10 each turn.

The row already has a Sunflower in column 0 but no defender, and the Regular Zombie (N) in that row is currently at column 6. By placing a Wall‐nut right before it, you force the zombie to stop and attack the Wall‐nut—a plant with 10 HP that will delay its progress. This extra time should help you build toward a stronger defense in later turns when you’ll have enough sun to upgrade to attacking plants.","Answer: J 2 4\n\nI’ve chosen to plant a Wall‐nut (J) on row 2, column 4. In row 2 a zombie has already arrived (with the wall‐nut there in column 5), and this additional Wall‐nut will serve as an extra barrier to slow the zombie’s progress toward the sunflower at column 0. With a cost of 50 sun, it leaves you with 35 sun remaining for now while helping to protect your vital sun-producing plant.","Answer: W 0 3","Answer: X 4 2","Answer: X 3 0","Answer: W 3 4;J 3 5","Answer: X 1 1","Answer: W 2 3\n\nI recommend planting a Peashooter (W) in row 2, column 3. This positioning puts its attack directly in line with the zombie group currently at column 5, helping to chip away at their HP before they can bulldoze through your Wall-nut defense at column 4. At a cost of 100 sun, you’ll still have 25 sun remaining, and the offensive boost is important given the advancing zombies on row 2.","Answer: W 3 2\n\nI’ve chosen to plant a Peashooter (W) in row 3, column 2. This extra shooter should help focus fire on the advancing zombie in row 3—especially with a new zombie about to spawn on turn 15—while the existing plants continue to slow the threat and provide sun income.","Answer: X 0 2","Answer: J 0 5;X 1 6\n\nAnalysis:\n• In row0 the zombie (N) is advancing and will soon move from column 6. By placing a Wall‐nut (J, cost 50 sun) at column 5, we provide a stronger block (10 HP) than the existing plant at column 4 so that the advancing zombie is delayed while being fired upon by the Peashooter at column 3.\n• In row1 there is ample space and two Sunflowers already (at columns 0 and 1), but adding an extra Sunflower (X, cost 50 sun) at column 6 further boosts your sun income (10 extra sun per turn) with little risk since no zombies are present.\nThis uses 100 sun total; with a starting sun of 140 you’ll still have 40 sun left for future flexibility.","Answer: X 1 3;X 4 3\n\nAnalysis:\nAt turn 17 you have a moderate sun reserve (145 sun) and are seeing zombies appear in row0 and row2. Both rows already have a frontline defense—a wall‐nut and peashooter in row0 and a similar setup in row2. To improve your long‐term economy (and ultimately your damage potential in later turns), it’s worthwhile to invest in additional sun production with sunflowers even though the current immediate threat isn’t extreme. \n\nBy planting a Sunflower in a safe cell (for example, row1 col3 and row4 col3, where they won’t immediately be targeted), you spend 50 sun for each sunflower (totaling 100 sun), leaving some reserve and ensuring you get the extra 10 sun per turn from each sunflower. This boost in sun income is critical given that later turns will introduce tougher zombies and increased zombie spawn rates and HP. \n\nThus, planting a sunflower on row1 in column 3 and another on row4 in column 3 is a sound choice at turn 17.","Answer: W 2 2\n\nI’m choosing to plant an extra Peashooter in row 2 at column 2. Both row 0 and row 2 are already under pressure (row 0 has a zombie in the “JN” cell and row 2 already has a wall‐nut with zombies “JNR”). Adding a Peashooter in row 2 should boost offensive firepower so that we can more quickly chip away at the roadblock and regular zombies there while our other plants continue to hold the line. This move costs 100 sun (leaving 70 sun for later turns) and should help us delay the zombies’ progress until further sun or additional defensive\/offensive plants can be deployed later.","I recommend bolstering the firepower on the row with the tougher zombie. Notice that in row2 the zombie in cell 4 is a Roadblock Zombie (R has 8 HP) and is already in contact with a Wall‐nut (J), which will only delay its progress for so long. By planting an extra Peashooter (W) to the left of that encounter—say, in row2 column1—we add another source of damage against the approaching enemy. (A Peashooter costs 100 sun, leaving you with 95 sun, and its damage will help dispatch that Roadblock faster.) \n\nAnswer: W 2 1","Answer: J 0 6; X 4 4\n\nAnalysis:\n• In row0 the zombie‐infested cell “JN” at column5 is already defended by a Wall‐nut at col4 and a Peashooter at col3, but the incoming zombie remains a concern. Planting an extra Wall‐nut (J) at row0, column6 creates an additional barrier to delay its advance.\n• In a relatively safe lane (row4) we add a Sunflower (X) at column4. This inexpensive sun generator (cost 50, +10 sun each turn) helps boost our sun income so we can eventually afford stronger plants if needed.\n\nThis uses 50 sun for J plus 50 sun for X, costing 100 sun total and leaving 120 sun remaining.","Answer: W 4 5;H 3 1\n\nExplanation:\n• In row4 the only cell immediately to the left of the dangerous High‐Attack zombie (I in col6) is col5 and it’s empty – so we plant a Peashooter (W) there to start attacking it.\n• In row3 the Peashooter already at col2 can be boosted by a Torch Stump placed immediately to its left (cell row3 col1 is empty). Boosting that shooter should help against the tough Bucket zombie (B in col6).\nThese moves cost 100 + 125 = 225 sun (leaving 30 sun) and provide extra firepower and defensive economy as the zombies continue their advance.","Answer: W 1 5\n\nI decided to plant a Peashooter in row 1, column 5. Row 1 currently only has sunflowers even though a zombie (a Regular Zombie, “N”) has reached column 6. By putting a Peashooter at col 5, it will stand in front of the advancing zombie and start shooting it from next turn, slowing its progress and helping to protect the more vulnerable sunflowers behind. This defensive addition looks critical at this stage of the game while keeping our sun and potential future plays in mind.","Answer: W 1 2","Answer: H 3 3;W 4 1\n\nExplanation:\n• In row 3 a Torch Stump (H) is placed in column 3. This will buff the Peashooter at (3,2) (its immediate left), increasing its damage from 1 to 2—helpful against the tougher Bucket zombie already present.\n• In row 4 a Peashooter (W) is planted in column 1 to help deal with the High-Attack zombie present later in the row.\nThis uses 125 sun for H and 100 sun for W (totaling 225 sun), which is exactly the available sun.","Answer: W 1 4","Answer: W 4 4\n\nI’ve decided to plant a Peashooter in row 4, column 4. With 140 sun available, spending 100 on W leaves some reserve while bolstering row 4’s defense. In that row there’s already a sunflower and a peashooter in column 1, but the high‐attack zombie (I) that’s currently in column 3 is dangerous. Placing the Peashooter in col4 adds extra damage output so that when the zombie approaches it will be attacked from further right before it can reach the more vulnerable plants. This extra firepower should help delay (or eliminate) the threat in row 4, buying time for additional sun production and further defensive moves in subsequent turns.","Answer: X 0 0;W 2 4","Answer: W 0 1\n\nAnalysis:\nLooking at the board, row0 has a Regular Zombie (N) on top of a Wall‐nut at column6. The only shooter currently in row0 is the Peashooter at col3, and the cells left of the zombie aren’t as well defended. Noticing that row0, column1 is empty and lies to the left of the zombie, we can add another Peashooter (W) there for 100 sun. This extra shooter will also damage the first (left‐most) zombie in row0 each turn, helping to chip away at the zombie before it can get too dangerous. With 120 sun available, spending 100 sun is within our means while leaving some sun in reserve.\n\nThus, the move is to plant a Peashooter in row 0, column 1.","I'll choose to “invest in our economy” so that we’ll have more sun to pay for tougher defenses (or even a Fire Chili later) when the zombie pressure increases. In our current position the front‐line in both row1 and row4 is already being “chewed on” by a High‐Attack zombie (I) that deals 3 damage, and our only shooting plant in row1 isn’t buffed. We don’t have room in the hot zones for a new blocker without replacing an existing plant, and our sun is still tight. (Remember that for a Torch Stump the buff only works if placed immediately to the right of a plant – and none of our vulnerable attackers currently have a free adjacent cell.) \n\nSo with our 135 sun at turn 29 it makes sense to spend 100 sun on two extra sunflowers (X). I’ll plant them in an “economy lane” where no zombies are present – namely, row3 (which already has some plants defending it) where cells 5 and 6 are free. This way we upgrade our sun income for future turns without endangering our key defensive lanes.\n\nAnswer: X 3 5;X 3 6","Answer: W 1 6; X 2 6","Answer: W 1 4\n\nFor this turn I’m suggesting we plant a Peashooter (W) on row 1, column 4. This extra shooter in row 1 should help boost our damage output against the high‐attack zombie “I” that has advanced to column 3. With our current row 1 already having one Peashooter at col2 and another at col6, an extra shooter now will bring the total damage per turn in this row up—hopefully taking down the dangerous zombie faster before it can overrun our weaker sunflowers in col0 and col1.\n\nThe move uses 100 sun, leaving us with 45 for the next turn (along with the guaranteed extra 25 sun and the sun from our sunflowers), and helps shore up our defenses in a lane that’s beginning to show significant threat.\n\nLet’s see how this strengthens the board going into turn 32!","Answer: W 1 5;X 4 2\n\nI'll explain my choice briefly:\n\n• In row1 the cell at column 5 is empty. Planting a Peashooter (W, cost 100 sun) there adds extra firepower in a row already facing a high‐attack zombie (the “I” in cell [1,2]) and the bucket zombie at column 6. Both zombies are highly dangerous, so adding one more shooter helps speed up their elimination.\n\n• In row4 the cell at column 2 is empty. Planting a Sunflower (X, cost 50 sun) there boosts our economy by providing 10 extra sun per turn. Though row4 is not under immediate attack, preparing for future turns is important.\n\nThe combined cost is 100 + 50 = 150 sun, which is within our available 170 sun, leaving a little extra for upcoming turns.","Answer: X 4 3; X 4 5","Answer: W 1 3;X 4 6","Answer: H 2 4; X 1 2","Answer: J 1 5;W 2 5\n\nHere's the reasoning behind the move:\n\n• In row1 the advancing zombies (a Bucket Zombie at column5 and a High‐Attack Zombie at column6) are starting to press the defense. Although row1 already has three sunflowers and two peashooters, none are in the “front‐line” to block the incoming horde. By planting a Wall‑nut (J, cost 50 sun, 10 HP) in row1 column5 where a zombie is already present, the Wall‑nut becomes the blocking plant. It will force the Bucket Zombie to attack it (at 1 damage per turn), giving the behind‐line shooters more time to focus fire before the horde gets all the way to the sunflowers.\n\n• In row2, there’s a dangerous High‑Attack Zombie (I, 6 HP, dealing 3 damage per turn) in column3 plus a Regular Zombie (N) in column6. Row2 already has a peashooter (and even a cell with “WN”) but an extra peashooter can boost the overall damage per turn on the “first zombie” (which in row2 is the one in column3). Placing a Peashooter (W, cost 100 sun, 2 HP, 1 damage per turn) in row2 column5 – an empty cell – will add another shooter to help take the high‑attack threat down faster.\n\nThese two placements cost a total of 150 sun (50 + 100), fitting within the available 155 sun while leaving a tiny remainder.","Answer: W 3 6; J 1 6\n\nExplanation:\n• By spending 100 sun to plant a Peashooter at row 3, column 6, we add extra ranged firepower in the row where zombies (a bucket, a Roadblock and a high‐attack) are already pressing. Every shooter in a row targets the front zombie regardless of its position, so this extra Peashooter can help whittle down that dangerous front enemy.\n• With the remaining 50 sun, planting a Wall‐nut at row 1, column 6 provides another barrier behind the already engaged wall‐nut (with Bucket and High-Attack zombies) in row 1. This extra Wall‐nut will help delay any new threats that reach that row and give your shooters more time.\n•\nThis combination uses exactly 150 sun and shores up your defenses in the rows under pressure.","Answer: H 3 5\n\nI chose to plant a Torch Stump (H) in row 3, column 5. In row 3 the cell at column 4 holds a Peashooter (“W”) that is currently fending off a mix of Bucket (B), Roadblock (R) and High‐Attack (I) zombies. By placing the Torch Stump immediately to the right (in a currently empty cell at 3,5), its buff will boost the left‐neighboring Peashooter’s damage by +1 (raising its output from 1 to 2 damage per turn). This extra firepower should help it eliminate the heavy zombie pressure sooner, even though it uses 125 sun (leaving 20 sun from the current 145).","Answer: W 2 5; X 2 3\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n• In row2 the only zombie present is the Regular Zombie (“N”) in column5. Currently row2 holds a Sunflower at col0, a Peashooter at col1, and a Torch Stump (H) at col4. Because zombies travel from the far right toward the left and always “attack” the rightmost plant (the one encountered first), the zombie will eventually hit the plant in col4. To help increase the DPS in that row, we want to “front‐line” an extra shooter so that the zombie is forced to punish a plant that can at least shoot while it absorbs damage.\n\n• By placing a Peashooter (W, costing 100 sun) in row2 column5 – even though a zombie is already there (this is legal since only one plant may occupy a cell, and there isn’t one yet) – we make that new shooter the rightmost plant in row2. Every turn it will deal 1 damage to the leftmost zombie in the row (which is still our Regular Zombie). Meanwhile the existing shooter in col1 will continue firing. Together they should quickly wear down the 4‐HP zombie before it can cause too much trouble.\n\n• With the remaining 65 sun, we can afford a Sunflower (X) for 50 sun. Placing it in an empty cell in row2 (say, column3) will not change the blocking order – the rightmost plant in row2 remains the newly placed Peashooter in col5 – yet it will generate an extra 10 sun per turn to help fund upcoming moves.\n\nThus, the suggested move on Turn 39 is to plant a Peashooter in row2 col5 and a Sunflower in row2 col3.","Answer: H 1 5\n\nI’ve decided to place a Torch Stump in row 1, column 5. Although that cell already contains a zombie (a Bucket Zombie “B”), there’s no plant present there so planting is allowed. By placing H at 1,5, its buffing effect will immediately apply to the plant in the adjacent left cell (row 1, column 4), which is a Peashooter already battling the dangerous High‐Attack Zombie present there. This buff increases its damage by +1 (from 1 to 2), which should help in quickly reducing the high‐attack threat before it can do too much damage. \n\nThis move uses 125 sun from the available 170, leaving 45 sun; this is a defensive upgrade meant to help slow and eventually eliminate the zombies in row 1 before they progress any further.\n\nLet’s see how it unfolds!","Answer: H 3 3\n\nI recommend placing a Torch Stump in row 3, column 3. Here’s the reasoning:\n\n• In row 3 the cell at column 2 (“WRI”) already shows that a Peashooter (W) is battling a Roadblock (R) and a High‐Attack (I) zombie. Because these zombies are already very far left (i.e. near your base), it’s critical to boost the damage output of that shooter.\n  \n• A Torch Stump (H) costs 125 sun (which fits within our 200 sun reserve) and when placed immediately to the right of a plant, it directly increases that plant’s damage by +1. Placing H at row 3, col 3 will boost the Peashooter in col 2, giving it a better chance to dispatch the advancing zombies before they overrun your defenses.\n  \n• Other options (like planting extra Peashooters or sunflowers) wouldn’t address the immediate threat in row 3 where zombies have advanced dangerously close.\n\nThus, with the current resources and board state at turn 41, placing the Torch Stump at (3, 3) is the optimal move.","Answer: H 1 4;W 3 4","Answer: J 1 3;W 1 5\n\nI'm choosing to plant a Wall‐nut (J) in row 1, column 3 and a Peashooter (W) in row 1, column 5. The idea is that the Wall‐nut placed in the cell where the lone High‐Attack zombie (I) currently stands will serve as a temporary barrier to delay its progress (and protect the valuable Sunflower in column 2), while the Peashooter behind it will start chipping away at that leftmost threat. With these two plants the cost is 50 + 100 = 150 sun which is within our current 160 sun budget.\n\nThis maneuver should help slow the advancing zombie forces in row 1 by both stalling them and adding extra damage, buying us time until additional sun or plant opportunities arise in upcoming turns.","Answer: H 2 2\n\nAnalysis:\nRow2 currently contains a sunflower at column 0, a peashooter at column 1 that fires at the first zombie in the row, and then an empty spot at column 2 before cell “XB” at column 3 (which holds a sunflower and a bucket zombie). Adding a Torch Stump (H) at row 2, column 2 will buff the peashooter in column 1 – increasing its damage from 1 to 2 per turn – helping it to deal more damage to the zombie in column 3. At a cost of 125 sun, this move stays within the 165 sun budget while boosting row 2’s defenses against the advancing zombies.","Answer: W 1 4","Answer: X 2 4;X 2 5\n\nI'll explain my reasoning briefly:\n\nAt turn 46 you have 250 sun available, and with the board already busy with plants and zombies in most rows the safest spots for new sun production are the empty cells in row 2 (columns 4 and 5). Placing two Sunflowers (X) there (each costing 50 sun) not only costs only 100 sun in total but also gives you an extra 10 sun per turn.

This extra peashooter will help take down the zombies on the wall‐nut faster, while preserving sun and not overextending our defenses. This move costs 100 sun, leaving us with a sufficient reserve while aligning our attack with the current threat.","Answer: W 2 2\n\nI’ve chosen to plant a Peashooter (W) at row 2, column 2. Row 2 already has two Sunflowers (at col 0 and col 1), but it currently faces the Roadblock Zombie (R) at column 6. Since Sunflowers don’t attack, adding a Peashooter there will begin chipping away at the approaching zombie. With this move, you spend 100 sun out of your 125, and the new shooter will deal 1 damage per turn to the first zombie in row 2, helping to slow the zombie before it reaches your sun-producing plants.","Answer: W 2 3","Answer: J 4 4","Answer: W 4 2;X 3 3\n\n---\n\nExplanation:\n\n• In row4 the regular zombie (N) is approaching behind a Wall‑nut barrier. By placing a Peashooter (W) at row4, column2 (which is to the left of the zombie’s cell at column5), you add extra offensive firepower to help weaken the zombie before it reaches your left‐most defenses. \n\n• Meanwhile, investing 50 sun in a Sunflower (X) in a safe row (row3, column3) helps boost your sun income for later turns without exposing a fragile plant to imminent danger.\n\nThis move costs 100 + 50 = 150 sun (leaving 10 sun) and improves your offensive and economic setup on turn 19.","I recommend using your ≥100 sun to add a defensive shooter into the relatively “bare” row 3. Notice that row 3 currently has only two sunflowers (at col0 and col3), which provide economy but no offensive firepower. With new zombie types (Bucket and High-Attack) coming into play after turn 20 and a spawn on turn 20 itself, row 3 will need a plant that can shoot from a safe “buffer” position. By placing a Peashooter (W) just to the right of the sunflower at col3—say in column 4—you get an offensive plant closer to the zombie spawn line that will start picking off any zombie reaching that lane, yet its position (not too far to the right) should help it survive a few enemy advances.\n\nSo, I suggest using your 115 sun (cost 100 for a Peashooter, leaving you with 15 sun) to plant a Peashooter in row 3, column 4.\n\nAnswer: W 3 4","Answer: J 3 5; X 1 5\n\nI'll explain my reasoning briefly:\n\n• With 120 sun available on turn 21, we want a mix of defense and long‐term sun production.\n• In row3 the Roadblock zombie sitting at column 6 is advancing toward our Peashooter at column 4. Placing a Wall‐nut (J, cost 50 sun, 10 HP) at row3 column 5 will help stall it so our shooter can get more attacks in.\n• With the remaining 70 sun, we can afford a Sunflower (X, cost 50 sun) which, although we already have several, will boost our sun income further as the game progresses.\n• This combined play uses 100 sun (50 + 50), leaving a small surplus, and reinforces our defense against the current zombie threats while setting us up for sustained resource gains in future turns.\n\nThus, the move is to plant a Wall‐nut at row3 col5 and a Sunflower at row1 col5.","Answer: W 2 3\n\nI recommend placing a Peashooter (W) in row 2, column 3. Here’s the reasoning:\n\n• Row 2 already has a sunflower in col0, another in col1, and a peashooter in col2 that is currently “blocked” by a Roadblock zombie (R) in the same cell. That zombie, with 4 + 4 (extra HP after turn 10 adjustments) might soon overcome the small 2‐HP peashooter.\n\n• By adding an extra peashooter at col3 in row 2, both shooters will each turn target the leftmost (and currently blocking) zombie. This extra burst of damage should help eliminate that threat faster before it can destroy the plant in col2.\n\n• The cost of a Peashooter is 100 sun, and with 135 sun available this turn, planting this extra offensive unit is both an affordable and timely reinforcement.\n\nThus, with the extra firepower in row 2, you improve your defensive line against the advancing zombies.","Answer: H 1 4\n\nExplanation:\nAt turn 23 you have 150 sun. Noticing that in row 1 the Bucket Zombie (B) is currently on top of a Sunflower (X) at column 5—and that row already has Peashooters at columns 2 and 3—it can be very effective to boost the damage from the Peashooter at column 3. Placing a Torch Stump (H) in row 1 at column 4 (an empty cell) will increase the damage of the plant immediately to its left (the Peashooter) by +1 (from 1 to 2 damage per turn). This additional damage can help take down the higher‐HP Bucket Zombie faster, improving your chances in this critical moment.\n\nThus, the move is: H 1 4","Answer: W 3 6","Answer: W 4 1\n\nI'm choosing to plant a Peashooter (W) in row 4 at column 1. Here’s the reasoning:\n\n• Row 4 already has a Wall‐nut (J) at column 4 protecting against the High‑Attack Zombie (I) that has 6 HP and deals 3 damage. However, row 4’s only attacking plants right now are the Peashooters in columns 2 and 3 (each firing 1 damage per turn). Their combined fire (2 damage per turn) will require about 3 turns to eliminate a 6‑HP zombie. Because the zombie’s “high‐attack” makes it extra dangerous if it ever comes close enough to attack a shooter directly, speeding up its demise is critical.\n\n• With 145 sun available, spending 100 on an extra Peashooter leaves sun in reserve for later turns. Placing a Peashooter in row 4 (in a free cell to the left of the wall–nut) boosts that row’s total damage from 2 to 3 per turn, so the zombie will be dispatched a turn earlier.\n\n• Other rows either already have their attacking positions filled (like row 1, where the Bucket Zombie [12 HP] is present but there’s no free cell to the left) or face less urgent threats. Reinforcing row 4 should help ensure that the destructive High‑Attack zombie takes as little time as possible to be eliminated before it can inflict heavy damage.\n\nThus, the best move on turn 25 is to plant a Peashooter at row 4, column 1.","Answer: W 1 5;J 4 5\n\nI’ve chosen to plant a Peashooter (W) in row 1, column 5 so that the row—under pressure from two Bucket zombies—gets extra firepower. Increasing the damage in row 1 should hasten the elimination of the front enemy (the Bucket zombie in col 4) and help slow down the one coming in at col 6.\n\nIn addition, I’ve planted a Wall‐nut (J) in row 4, column 5. This adds a durable barrier on that row to delay the regular zombie coming in from the far right (currently in col 6) so that the already placed shooters have extra time to deal damage.\n\nThis combined move uses exactly 150 sun (Peashooter at 100 sun plus Wall‐nut at 50 sun) and addresses threats in two critical rows.","Answer: W 1 6","Answer: W 1 4\n\nI'm choosing to plant a Peashooter (W) in row 1, column 4. This move uses 100 sun (leaving 10 sun remaining) and helps boost the row‐wide damage against the Bucket Zombie (B) currently in row 1. With an extra shooter between the existing sunflowers and shooters (already in row 1) and the looming threat of stronger zombies (with Bucket Zombies having 12 HP), the additional damage—since every Peashooter in the row attacks the first (i.e. leftmost) zombie—will help eliminate the bucket zombie more quickly. Faster removal reduces the chance it will kill the currently fragile blocking plants.","Based on the current board and our sun supply of 115, it can be wise to invest in our long‐term economy. Even though several rows are already busy with defense against a Bucket (B) in row 1 and multiple zombies in rows 3 and 4, we’ll eventually face spawns (the next comes at turn 30) that will require more sun for tougher plants. Adding extra Sunflowers (X, cost 50, +10 sun\/turn) in safe spots will help us build up the resources needed later.\n\nLooking at the grid, rows 0 and 2 are not under immediate zombie attack and both have some open cells. For example, row 0 already has a Sunflower (col 0) and some defenders at col 3 and col 4. Placing another Sunflower in an open cell there (say col 5) gives more income without risking key defensive lines. In row 2, there are Sunflowers at col 0–1 and two Peashooters (W) at col 2–3 but cells col 4–6 are empty; placing one at col 4 is similarly safe and will bolster our sun production.\n\nPlanting two Sunflowers costs 50 + 50 = 100 sun, leaving 15 sun unused (which isn’t enough to buy any other plant this turn).\n\nThus, a recommended move is to plant one Sunflower on row 0, column 5 and one on row 2, column 4.\n\nAnswer: X 0 5;X 2 4","Answer: H 1 5","Answer: W 3 6","Answer: W 3 5\n\nI recommend placing a Peashooter at row 3, column 5. Here’s the reasoning:\n\n• In row 3 the zombies already present (“RR” in the same cell as a plant at column 4) mean that extra firepower is needed. A new Peashooter placed further to the right (at column 5) will become the new front‐line attacker. That way, when zombies eventually advance from the right side, they’ll first encounter the fresh Peashooter—which will help to thin their defenses before they can further damage your existing plants.\n\n• At 165 sun, spending 100 sun on a Peashooter still leaves a small reserve for later turns. (Other options were available—for example, using a Sunflower to build your economy or a wall‐nut for additional defense—but a direct boost in damage in the lane under pressure appears most urgent.)\n\nRemember that in this simplified Plants vs Zombies game the order in a row is determined by the rightmost plant: the new Peashooter at row 3, column 5 will become that crucial defensive spot.\n\nThus, the best move is to input: Answer: W 3 5","Answer: W 0 1;J 0 2","Answer: W 3 2","Based on the current board, the most urgent concern is row3. There the only shooter is at col2 and the only plant to the left of the zombie‐position in col3 is a Sunflower (X), which doesn’t shoot. To help keep the zombie at bay before it reaches the far left, we need more immediate firepower. A Peashooter (W) placed in row3 at an empty cell to the left of col3 (so that it immediately “sees” the advancing zombie) will add a valuable extra shot each turn.\n\nWith Sun = 180, a Peashooter costs 100 sun. With the remaining 80 sun it also makes sense to invest in increased sun production. Although it’s a risk to put a Sunflower where zombies lurk, there’s an available spot in row0 toward the far right—but still behind an established line of defense—for example, at col6 in row0. This Sunflower (X, costing 50 sun) will start providing the extra 10 sun per turn, helping for upcoming rounds (and you’ll still have 30 sun as a buffer).\n\nThus, a good move is to plant:\n• A Peashooter (W) in row3, col1 (to quickly help shoot the zombie that is approaching in row3),\n• And a Sunflower (X) in row0, col6 (to boost your sun income for later turns).\n\nFollowing the required format, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: W 3 1;X 0 6\n\nThis uses 100 + 50 = 150 sun, keeping you within your 180-sun budget for Turn 35 while improving both defense and economy.","Answer: W 0 5\n\nI decided to plant an extra Peashooter in row 0 at column 5. In row 0 the plants at columns 0–4 are already busy fighting a Roadblock Zombie (R) at col 4 (with the Torch Stump “H” already in that cell) and a High-Attack Zombie (I) lurking in col 6. Since the peashooters only hit the first zombie in the row—in this case, the zombie in col 4—that extra shooter will add another point of damage on that Roadblock Zombie. Removing that blocking zombie faster will allow the other shooters to start hitting the zombie farther right (the dangerous I), hopefully stalling its approach before it can deal its heavier damage. \n\nWith 145 sun available, spending 100 sun on a Peashooter leaves us in a tight but acceptable position.","Answer: W 2 4; J 4 4","Answer: X 3 3\n\nAnalysis:\nAt turn 38 you have 95 sun, so only the 50‐sun plants (Sunflower or Wall‐nut) are affordable. While a Wall‐nut would provide a robust barrier, the battlefield already shows multiple defensive plants and several lanes under pressure (for example, row0 and row1 already host zombies). In contrast, planting an extra Sunflower (X) in a relatively safe lane (row3 has several plants in place and no immediate zombie presence) should boost your economy by generating an extra 10 sun each turn. That increased sun production will help you afford stronger plants (such as peashooters or even fire chili) in the coming turns while supporting your defense. \n\nThus, placing a Sunflower at row 3, column 3 seems like the best balance between survival and economic buildup.","Answer: J 0 5;J 2 3;X 3 4","Answer: J 1 4\n\nI decided to reinforce the row where imminent danger is greatest. In Row1, there are zombies (“I” and “R”) in Column4 and no plant blocking them yet. By planting a Wall‐nut (J) there for 50 sun, you add a 10‐HP barrier that will force the zombies to attack it rather than immediately reaching the vital shooters in Columns2–3. This extra “buffer” should help hold the line a few extra turns while your peashooters continue dealing damage. With Sun at 115, spending 50 leaves you with 65 for upcoming turns while also boosting your defense when the next zombie wave comes.","Answer: J 4 1;W 4 2\n\nAnalysis:\n• In row4 the left‐most plant is a 2‐HP Sunflower (X) at column 0.

One effective tactic is to boost an already–present peashooter so that it deals 2 damage per turn instead of 1. Since the Torch Stump (H) costs 125 sun and gives a +1 damage bonus permanently to the plant immediately to its left (even if that plant later becomes the target for zombie damage), we can plant an H immediately to the right of the peashooter in row3, column 5.\n\nRow3 currently shows \"WR\" in column 5 and an empty cell at column 6.

Since our board already has several defensive and blocking plants (including a Peashooter, Wall‐nut, and even Wall‐nuts that are currently fighting zombies in row 4), it’s a good opportunity to bolster our economy by planting another Sunflower. Placing a Sunflower in an empty cell (for example, row 1, column 1) increases our sun income (an extra 10 sun per turn), which in turn helps us afford more expensive or defensive plants in future turns.","Answer: W 0 2\n\nExplanation:\nAt turn 11 you have 125 sun. Row 0 already has two Sunflowers at col0 and col1 but no shooter—and zombies (a pair of Roadblock Zombies “RR”) are already on col6. By planting a Peashooter (W) in row 0 at col2, you put a shooter behind the sunflowers. As the zombies move left, they’ll first be slowed by the Sunflowers (which have only 2 HP each), giving your new Peashooter time to deal 1 damage per turn to the dangerous Roadblock Zombies. While the Peashooter won’t kill an 8‐HP zombie by itself, delaying them here is crucial in letting your sun-generators accumulate resources for more costly defenses later.\n\nThus, with your available sun, planting “W 0 2” is a solid tactical choice.","I recommend buying a Wall‐nut (J) and placing it in row 0 so that it blocks the incoming Roadblock zombies (R) and delays them from reaching the Peashooter behind. This “stall” will give your shooter a couple more turns to chip away at their 8 HP before they start dealing damage. It costs 50 sun, leaving you with 60 sun for later turns. \n\nAnswer: J 0 4","Answer: H 0 3","Answer: W 0 5\n\nAnalysis:\nAt turn 14 you have 105 sun available, so you’re limited to planting only one plant costing either 50 or 100 sun. Reviewing the board shows a row‐0 situation in which a wall‐nut at column 4 is already blocking two Roadblock Zombies (each with 8 HP) while a boosted Peashooter (at column 2 with the adjacent Torch Stump at column 3) is dealing extra damage. However, with two heavy zombies attacking the wall‐nut, the damage output from that single shooter may not be enough to clear the threat before the wall is destroyed. By spending 100 sun on an additional Peashooter on row 0 (at column 5, one of the free cells in that row) you boost the row’s offensive capability. In subsequent turns the two shooters (one dealing 2 damage thanks to the torch boost and the newly planted one dealing 1 damage) will help overcome the advancing Roadblock Zombies faster, buying you time to build further economy or defenses.\n\nThus, planting “W 0 5” is the recommended move.","Answer: X 3 1\n\nI’ve chosen to plant a Sunflower (X) in row 3, column 1. This choice spends 50 sun (leaving 40 sun remaining) and boosts sun production by adding an extra 10 sun per turn. With the extra income, you’ll be better able to afford higher‐cost plants on future turns while continuing to build up defenses against the advancing zombies.","I'll go with a defensive play on row 2. Notice that on row2 the only current plant is a Sunflower at column0 while an enemy Roadblock Zombie (R) lurks at column6. Without any shooter there the zombie won’t receive any damage until it reaches the left‐side sunflower—which is very vulnerable (only 2 HP). By spending 100 sun, we can place a Peashooter (W) in row2 in a position that makes it the rightmost plant in that row so that it becomes the target for the approaching zombie and begins shooting as soon as its turn starts. (Remember that plants fire before zombies move, so even if the zombie reaches the same cell later it will already have been damaged.) \n\nChecking the grid, row2’s columns 1–5 are empty. Placing a Peashooter at column 5 ensures it is farther to the right than the sunflower in column0 and will thus be the plant that “blocks” the zombie’s path. This move costs 100 sun, leaving 35 sun in reserve for future turns.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nAnswer: W 2 5","Answer: W 2 3\n\nI’ll plant a Peashooter (W) in row 2, column 3. This will add extra damage in row 2 against the advancing Roadblock zombie already present in cell (2,5).

This move spends 50 sun—leaving us with 75 sun—and is made on a safe row without immediate zombie threats. Over the coming turns, the extra 10 sun per turn from this Sunflower will help build our economy for stronger defenses and attacks as the zombie pressure increases.","Answer: H 2 4; X 1 3\n\nExplanation:\n• In row2, there’s a Roadblock Zombie (R) at column 5 guarded by a lone Peashooter (W) at column 3. By placing a Torch Stump (H) at row2, column4, you boost the damage of that left‐neighboring Peashooter from 1 to 2, which should help dispatch the 8‑HP zombie faster.\n• With the remaining sun (180 – 125 = 55), planting a Sunflower (X, cost 50) in a safe row (row1, column3 is empty) will improve sun generation in upcoming turns.\nThis move uses 125 + 50 = 175 sun, leaving a slight surplus for future decisions.","Answer: W 3 6\n\nI'm choosing to plant a Peashooter (W) in row 3 at column 6. This uses 100 of our 120 sun while strengthening our defense on a row that currently has no offensive plant. With row 3 still empty of zombie presence, adding a peashooter there means that when a new zombie spawns in that lane (remember, a new zombie appears every 5 turns), it will immediately come under fire. This move helps cover a lane that is otherwise unguarded and adds to our overall offensive capability while keeping some sun in reserve.\n\nThis is one reasonable move given our current sun and board state.","Answer: J 4 5\n\nI’ve chosen to plant a Wall-nut (J) at row 4, column 5. Notice that row 4 is facing a dangerous High-Attack Zombie (I) at column 6. Although there’s already some defense in row 4 (a Peashooter at col2 and another Wall-nut at col3, with another plant–currently under attack–in col4), the gap in column 5 means that on the zombies’ next moves the High-Attack Zombie will advance unimpeded until it reaches a plant to block its progress. By placing an extra Wall-nut in col5, we add an extra buffering layer. This extra barrier will help delay I’s advance and allow your shooters in the row more turns to chip away at the 6 HP of the High-Attack Zombie before it can start taking down the critical plants. \n\nYou currently have 135 sun so spending 50 on a Wall-nut leaves you sun for future turns. This move offers a balance between defense and resource management while you prepare for the increased difficulty of upcoming zombie spawns.\n\nLet me know if you need any further explanation or another move!","Based on the current threats, we’d like to shore up our defenses in two “hot‐zones.” In row2 the zombie lineup (an 8‐HP Roadblock at column4 in front of our lone Peashooter at column3—with a 4‐HP Regular zombie queued behind at column5) is too slow to be dispatched by a single 1‐damage shot per turn. By “backing up” that row with an extra shooter placed in an empty cell to the left of the blocking shooter (so that the “front” shooter remains the one that blocks and is attacked, while the extra shooter safely adds damage each turn), we can double the firepower on the tanky Roadblock. (In our simplified rules the “first zombie” for all shooters is taken from the row, so extra damage helps us whittle the tumor zombie down faster.) \n\nIn row4 we see that a Wall‐nut (J) at column5 is sharing the cell with a High‐Attack zombie (I). Because zombies in a row always “attack the plant that blocks their path” in the rightmost (front) planted cell, both the Roadblock on column4 and the High‐Attack zombie in column5 would be converging on that current blocker. As things stand the extra 3‐damage from I plus 1‐damage from a Roadblock add up to 4 per turn against a plant that has 10 HP—allowing only about three turns of resistance before it gives way. By placing a cheap additional barrier (a Wall‐nut costing 50 sun) in column6, we “push back” the frontline in row4. The new Wall‐nut in column6 becomes the new barrier (zombies always hit the rightmost planted cell), sparing our row4 cell at column5 from immediate assault and buying extra time to whittle down the zombie horde.\n\nWe have 200 sun at turn 22. A commonly balanced choice here is to:\n • Place a Peashooter (W, 100 sun) in row2 on an empty cell (say column2) so that the row gets an extra 1‐damage shot (while keeping the existing rightmost shooter as the blocking unit).\n • Place a Wall‐nut (J, 50 sun) in row4 at column6 to serve as an extra buffer for that row.\n\nThis uses 150 sun (100 + 50) and leaves 50 sun unspent for growth on a future turn.\n\nThus the move for turn 22 is:\n\nAnswer: W 2 2;J 4 6\n\nFeel free to ask if you’d like to discuss other potential strategies!","Answer: J 2 4\n\nAnalysis:\nLooking at the board, row2 has some urgency—a Regular Zombie (N) already occupies column 4 in an otherwise empty cell and is approaching the plants stationed further left. Although row2 already hosts two peashooters (in columns 2 and 3) that will target the frontmost zombie, without an immediate block the zombie will continue moving and could eventually force its way to damage those shooters. By planting a Wall‐nut (J, costing 50 sun) in row2, column 4, you put a sturdy barrier (10 HP) right where the zombie is. This will cause the zombie to focus on eating the Wall‐nut (dealing 1 damage per turn) while the peashooters chip away at its 4 HP. In effect, the Wall‐nut delays the zombie long enough for your shooters to eliminate it safely. \n\nUsing 50 sun out of your 165 sun leaves you with 115 sun, which is acceptable for the midterm defenses. \n\nThus, the move “J 2 4” is a timely and effective defensive placement.","Answer: W 4 0;H 4 1","Answer: W 1 4\n\nAnalysis:\nRow1 is currently occupied solely by Sunflowers (X), which produce sun but do not attack incoming zombies. This leaves row1 vulnerable if a new zombie spawns there, especially as further waves get tougher. By spending 100 sun (with our current 120 sun) to plant a Peashooter (W) at row1, column4, we add a shooter that will target the first zombie in that row. This helps bolster our defense in a row that otherwise contains only the fragile sun‐gatherers. \n\nNote that after this move you'll have 20 sun left. Future turns should focus on balancing economy with defense as the game escalates.","Answer: X 2 1;X 4 4","Answer: W 3 2;J 3 5\n\nI’ve chosen to bolster the vulnerable row3. Currently, row3 only has sunflowers at col0 and col1 while a High‐Attack zombie (I) lurks in col6. Placing a Peashooter (W) in row3 at column 2 (cost 100) lets us start dealing damage to that advancing zombie. In addition, adding a Wall‑nut (J) in row3 at column 5 (cost 50) will serve as a temporary barrier to slow the zombie’s progress—giving your new peashooter extra time to chip away at its HP.\n\nThis move spends 150 sun (100+50) and leaves you with 20 sun remaining, and should help defend against the imminent threat on row3.","Answer: J 3 4\n\nAnalysis:\nAt turn 28 we have 155 sun. Reviewing the board shows that every lane’s front‐line plant (the rightmost plant left of the zombie in that row) is under attack. In particular, row3 has a dangerous High‐Attack zombie (I, 6 HP, dealing 3 damage) in column 5 with only a shooter at col2 to do 1 damage per turn. To help slow that zombie’s advance, placing a sturdy Wall‑nut (J, cost 50 sun, 10 HP) in an empty cell before the zombie is the priority. Row3’s column 4 is empty and lies immediately in front of the zombie, so planting “J 3 4” creates a barrier to delay it. This uses 50 sun (leaving 105 sun in reserve for later turns) and bolsters your defense where it’s needed most.","I'm going to use our available sun (230) to shore up our most vulnerable line. Notice that row1 is critical—it’s our main sun‐production row filled with Sunflowers, but there’s already a Regular Zombie (N) sitting on a Peashooter in column 4. That zombie’s 4 HP combined with its potential to damage several fragile sunflowers poses a serious threat. (Remember that zombies “eat” the plant in their cell each turn; if the plant dies, the zombie continues unchallenged.) \n\nOne strong defensive idea is to boost the damage of the shooter already in row1 by planting a Torch Stump (H) immediately to its right (in col5). That Torch Stump will add +1 damage directly to the plant in col4 (only once, so it matters where we use it). An extra point of damage can help the shooter take down that Regular Zombie faster.\n\nWe can even add an extra shooter in the same row (say in column 6) with a Peashooter (W) to add more firepower. (A boosted shooter will deal 2 damage per turn instead of its normal 1, and the new shooter will add another 1 damage—totalling 3 damage per turn in row1. That should take the 4‐HP zombie down in two attacks, especially since the zombie takes its turn after our plants shoot.)\n\nThe cost for H is 125 sun and for W is 100 sun; the total is 225 sun, which is within our 230 sun budget (leaving 5 sun in reserve).\n\nSo I will send the move command: \n\nAnswer: H 1 5;W 1 6\n\nThis places a Torch Stump in row1 column5 (boosting the shooter in column4) and a Peashooter in row1 column6 (adding extra firepower), helping secure our vital sun-producing lane while fending off the advancing Regular Zombie.","Answer: J 1 4;X 2 5","Answer: W 3 3;X 4 5\n\nExplanation:\n• In row 3, where a bucket zombie (B, 12 HP) and a regular zombie (N) are already present near the right end, adding a Peashooter (W) in column 3 (behind the current frontline at column 5) will contribute additional fire to help eliminate the looming threat.\n• In row 4 the existing wall‐nut (J) with a zombie is holding the front; by planting a Sunflower (X) at column 5 (which is safely behind the frontline in column 6), you boost your sun income (by an extra 10 sun per turn) without exposing the fragile Sunflower immediately.\n• This use of 100 sun for the peashooter and 50 sun for the sunflower uses 150 out of your 165 sun, leaving a little extra for later turns.\n\nGood luck on turn 31!","Answer: J 3 5;W 2 6","I'm going to invest about 150 sun this turn by adding both an offensive and an economic asset. Row0 is especially worrisome: it currently has only Sunflowers at col0 and col1 while a Roadblock zombie (R) is already at col2. (Remember that in our simplified game the “first zombie in the row” gets hit by each shooter regardless of exact positioning.) Although the sunflowers are great for income, they don’t deal damage, and that zombie will keep chipping away at them. Meanwhile the other lanes already have some shooters to help hold back the advancing hordes.\n\nMy plan is to plant a Peashooter (W, cost 100) in row0 – using one of the empty cells on the far right so that it “joins the fight” as soon as the zombie comes around (and even though it might be to the right of the zombie, in our simplified rules every shooter attacks if any zombie is present in its row). In addition, I’ll add a Sunflower (X, cost 50) in row0 as well so that we get a bit more sun income in the future.\n\nI’ve checked row0’s available cells: col0 and col1 are taken by sunflowers, col2 contains a lone zombie, and cells col3, col4, col5, and col6 are still free. I’ll choose col3 for the sunflower and col6 for the Peashooter.\n\nThat uses a total of 100 + 50 = 150 sun (within our 155-sun budget) and leaves us with a little extra for later.\n\nAnswer: W 0 6;X 0 3","Answer: W 3 6\n\nI decided to invest in extra firepower for row 3. That row already has three zombies (a high‐attack, a bucket, and a regular zombie) gathering in column 5 and attacking the wall‐nut at column 4. Planting a Pea­shooter (W) at row 3, column 6 (the only free space in that row) will allow it to attack the left‐most zombie in that row every turn. Although it costs 100 sun (leaving you with 60), row 3 appears to be the most urgent threat, so bolstering its defense with an additional shooter should help hold back the advancing horde.","Answer: W 3 5\n\nI recommend planting a Peashooter (W) at row 3, column 5. Row 3 is facing a tougher zombie combination—a Bucket Zombie (B) alongside a Regular Zombie (N) attacking the Wall‐nut in column 4. Although there are already several shooters in the row, adding one more increases the row’s overall damage per turn. With a Peashooter dealing 1 damage per turn, boosting the DPS from 3 to 4 should help whittle down the tougher foes before the Wall‐nut’s 10 HP is drained. This extra firepower should delay the zombies long enough to provide a safer window until the next spawn while keeping sun expenditure reasonable (100 sun from your current 205).","I'll go with a two‐plant defense in the top row (row0) to help protect the very vulnerable sunflower in col0 from the advancing Roadblock zombie in col1. The idea is to “sacrifice” a sturdy barrier so that the zombie stops hitting the fragile sunflower and meanwhile gets slowly picked off by a peashooter added behind the barrier.\n\nHere’s the plan for row0:\n• In cell (row0, col1) the cell already has a zombie (R) but no plant. We can plant a Wall‑nut (J) there. Its 10 HP will soak the zombie’s 1‐damage hits for about 10 turns.\n• In cell (row0, col2) (currently “0”) we plant a Peashooter (W). Even though a regular peashooter only deals 1 damage per turn, over the several turns needed the shooter will repeatedly chip away at the Roadblock zombie’s 8 HP.\n\nCost check:\n Wall‑nut (J) costs 50 sun plus Peashooter (W) costs 100 sun = 150 sun spent.\nWith 250 sun available, that leaves 100 sun for future turns.\n\nThis setup should give the row0 zombie time to be shot down before it can break through to the sunflower at col0.\n\nSo my answer (using the required format) is:\n\nAnswer: J 0 1;W 0 2","Answer: W 3 6;X 2 5","I'll go with a move that immediately bolsters our defenses on the row that’s otherwise letting a lone zombie through. Notice that on line1 (row 1) we have several Sunflowers and a Wall‑nut and Torch Stump, but our only enemy on that row—a Regular Zombie (N) in column 6—is not being attacked by any offensive plant. Since Peashooters deal damage (even though only 1 per turn) and are our most economical offensive unit at this stage (costing 100 sun), placing one on row1 in the empty cell at column 6 (even though a zombie is already there, remember that plants and zombies may coexist in the same grid cell provided there isn’t already a plant) should start whittling down that zombie before it reaches our more valuable plants.\n\nWe have 230 sun; a 100‐sun peashooter is affordable and will leave us with a healthy balance for upcoming turns.\n\nThus, I will plant a Peashooter (W) at row 1, column 6.\n\nAnswer: W 1 6","Answer: H 3 6\n\nLet's explain the reasoning briefly.\n\nLooking at the current board at turn 39 we see that row3 is under particular pressure. In row3 column5 there is a Peashooter (W) already in place, but it’s facing an approaching High‐Attack zombie (I) that deals 3 damage per turn. With the peashooter’s low 2‐HP, it is at risk of being overwhelmed before it can deal sufficient damage. By planting a Torch Stump (H) in the empty cell at row3 column6, its “neighbor to the left”—the peashooter in column5—gets its damage boosted by +1 every turn. This extra damage can help dispatch the threatening zombie sooner and hopefully ensure that row3’s defenses survive.\n\nThis move costs 125 sun, which—with your current 275 sun—keeps you within budget while reinforcing your defense where it’s most needed.\n\nThus, the suggested input is: \n  Answer: H 3 6","Answer: W 1 6;W 0 5;X 4 4","Answer: H 3 4\n\nI recommend placing a Torch Stump in row 3, column 4. In row 3 the plant at column 3 (a peashooter) is already under attack by a regular zombie (“N”) and adjacent to a challenging high‐attack zombie (“I”) already in column 4. By planting a Torch Stump at (3,4)—even though that cell already contains a zombie—you both add a defensive plant and immediately buff the peashooter immediately to its left (in column 3), increasing its damage from 1 to 2. With this extra damage the peashooter should better help clear the front‐line zombie before it can overwhelm the lane. This move costs 125 sun (leaving you with 75 sun from your 200), which is a reasonable investment at Turn 41 given the threats on row 3.\n\nThus, the command is: Answer: H 3 4","Answer: W 3 5;X 0 6\n\nI’ve decided to bolster a row where a high‐attack zombie is already causing problems. In row3 the only empty cell is column 5 and it lies immediately to the left of an existing Torch Stump (H) in column 6. By planting a Peashooter (W) at (3,5), that shooter will get the additional +1 damage bonus from the Torch Stump to its right—raising its output from 1 to 2 per turn. This extra firepower should help counter the dangerous High‐Attack zombie (I) already in row3 (and any other stragglers advancing in that lane). \n\nThen, with the remaining sun (220 – 100 = 120 sun left) I’m adding a Sunflower (X) at (0,6), placed in one of row0’s several unoccupied cells. Although Sunflowers are fragile (2 HP) they are best set as far‐to‐the right as possible so that the front‐line plants (already in row0) continue holding back the bucket zombies in that lane while the new Sunflower boosts my future economy with an extra 10 sun per turn.\n\nThis move uses 100 sun for the enhanced shooter plus 50 sun for the sunflower (total cost 150 sun), leaving some sun in reserve for future moves.","Answer: W 1 6\n\nI chose to plant a Peashooter (W) in row 1 at column 6. In row 1 the nearest zombies (“NI” in column 5) – a Regular and a High-Attack Zombie – pose a direct threat, especially since High-Attack Zombies deal 3 damage per turn. Adding a Peashooter there should help start chipping away at these foes before they progress further and put additional strain on your defensive wall‐nut at column 4. With your current sun (225), the 100 sun cost fits comfortably while keeping some reserve.","Answer: W 0 4;W 1 5\n\nI'll explain my reasoning briefly: In our current situation—with an extra 280 sun—I decided to reinforce our firepower in the rows facing immediate threats. In row0 the zombie at column 5 (a Regular Zombie) will benefit from a new Peashooter at column 4 that can start chipping away at it before it reaches our more vulnerable plants. In row1 the wall‐nut at column 4 is already fighting off both a Regular and a High-Attack Zombie. Adding a Peashooter at column 5 will help target those zombies (since plants shoot the foremost zombie in their row) and help bring down the attackers before they overwhelm the wall‐nut. \n\nThus, using 100 sun for each Peashooter (totaling 200 sun) leaves some sun in reserve while bolstering our defenses on key lanes.","Based on the current board state, one worrying issue is in row4: the zombie (a Bucket Zombie, “B”) appearing alone in column 6 means that nothing is stopping it from eventually advancing and eating the sunflowers behind it. A good short‐term tactic is to put a blocker right there so that the zombie is forced to take several turns to break through instead of making a fast run for your valuable sun-producing plants. \n\nSince a Wall‐nut costs only 50 sun, has a solid 10 HP, and can delay the zombie’s progress, we can spend 50 sun to plant one at row4, column6. This will use part of your 225 sun but it’ll delay the Bucket Zombie in row4, buying extra time for your attacking and sun–generating plants to do their work.\n\nThus, the move is:\n\nAnswer: J 4 6\n\nThis move places a Wall‑nut at row4, col6 to block the Bucket Zombie.","I recommend using this turn’s opportunity to clear an especially dangerous lane. Notice in row2 there’s a Wall‑nut at col4 that’s already beset by two Bucket zombies (“B”) plus a High‑Attack zombie (“I”) is lurking at col6. Those Bucket zombies have high HP and will be hard to overcome with regular Peashooters. With 320 sun available, planting a Fire Chili (F) would immediately eliminate all zombies on that row, even though there are some helpful plants there already (like Sunflower “X” and Peashooter “W”). Since the effect applies to every zombie in the entire row, this will relieve the pressure on row2.\n\nLooking at the board, row2 has an empty spot at column 5. So placing a Fire Chili at row2, column5 is both legal and tactically beneficial.\n\nAnswer: F 2 5","Answer: W 0 3; X 2 5\n\nI'm choosing to add a Peashooter in row0 (at column3) so that row0 – which is being heavily assailed by the two Bucket zombies in column1 and other zombies further right – gains a shooting unit to help thin out the advancing threats. This new shooter will target the left‐most zombies (currently the Bucket zombies) and hopefully slow their progress enough to keep the fragile Sunflower in column0 from being overrun.\n\nTo help ensure we generate more sun in the coming turns (and not further compromise our future defense options), I’m also planting an extra Sunflower in a comparatively safe spot (row2, column5). With a cost of 100 for the Peashooter and 50 for the Sunflower, the total cost is 150—leaving us with 15 sun remaining this turn.\n\nThis strategy addresses our immediate need for damage output on a row under heavy pressure while keeping our long‐term engine (sun production) running.","Answer: J 3 1; X 2 6\n\nI'll explain my reasoning briefly. In the current board at turn 48 the row‐3 leftmost cell (“XI”) has a sunflower that is already under assault by a high‐attack zombie (I) that deals 3 damage, and we’re at risk of losing our (already fragile) defenses in that lane. By planting a Wall‐nut (J) in row 3, column 1 we hope to force that aggressive zombie to focus its attack on a sturdier barrier (10 HP) rather than the vulnerable sunflower. Meanwhile, using our available 150 sun we still have 100 sun left after the Wall‐nut (cost 50); by spending another 50 sun to add a Sunflower (X) in row 2, column 6 (an empty, relatively safe cell) we boost our future sun income. This combination (J for stalling an immediate threat in row 3 and X for improving our economy) uses exactly 100 sun out of the 150 while leaving a little reserve.\n\nNote that many moves exist in this strategic situation, and this is one valid decision based on the described threats and resource constraints.","Answer: J 0 4;W 4 6"],"prompt":"\nIn the following, you are required to participate in a simplified version of the Plants vs. Zombies game.

By planting a Peashooter (W) in row1 – ideally in the rightmost available slot (col4) so it’s as near as possible to the advancing threat – you add an immediate 1‑damage per turn attack to help take down the zombie before it can wear down the Wall‑nut.

That plant only deals 1 damage per turn, while two other Peashooters in row1 (at column3 and column6) also shoot—but only those planted to the left of the zombie can help. \n\n• By planting a Torch Stump (H) at row1, column5 (an empty cell immediately to the right of the plant at col4), you buff that Peashooter’s damage by +1 (from 1 to 2). \n\n• This extra damage means that the row’s attackers will do 2 (from the buffed plant) + 1 (from the shooter at col3) + 1 (from the shooter at col6) = 4 damage per turn against the bucket zombie. That should bring its 12 HP down in about 3 turns, hopefully before it overpowers its small 2‐HP defender.\n\n• The Torch Stump costs 125 sun; with 145 sun available this turn, that is a suitable defensive investment.\n\nThus, the best move is to plant:\n  H 1 5","Answer: J 3 5; X 2 6","Answer: W 3 4\n\nI’ve decided to spend 100 sun to plant a Peashooter (W) at row 3, column 4. The reason is that in row 3 the only attacking plant is the Peashooter at column 1, and there’s currently a Roadblock Zombie (R) at column 5 that has 8 HP. A new shooter placed at column 4 will join in attacking the zombie and serve as an immediate block—forcing the zombie to attack it instead of moving further left. This extra firepower should help thin the Roadblock’s HP over the next turns while our other lanes remain reasonably covered.\n\nWith the cost of 100, our remaining sun (of 160) drops to 60. In future turns, we can consider investing remaining sun into boosting our economy with a Sunflower (X) or further reinforcing any lanes that become threatened.","Answer: X 2 3","Answer: W 3 6;W 4 6","Answer: X 0 0;H 0 5\n\nHere's the reasoning behind the choice:\n\n• We currently have 205 sun. A Sunflower costs 50 and gives extra sun income each turn, helping our economy for the upcoming waves. Placing one on row 0 (cell 0,0) is safe since no zombie is currently in that row.\n\n• We also have a free slot at row 0, column 5. Placing a Torch Stump there (cost 125 sun) will boost the Peashooter in row 0, column 4 by +1 damage per turn. That extra damage will help in taking down any zombies that may eventually appear via the far right (especially when the next spawn comes at turn 35). \n\nThe total cost is 50+125=175 sun, leaving a modest remainder for upcoming turns while strengthening both our economy and front‐line defense.","Answer: X 1 6\n\nAnalysis:\nAt turn 31, with 175 sun available and zombies already advancing in rows 2 and 3 (which are fully occupied and already in combat), immediate overhauls in those rows aren’t possible since no empty cells remain there. Instead, it is wise to invest in our sun‐economy to ensure we can afford larger, more defensive or offensive plants in upcoming turns—especially as new zombies will spawn every five turns and tougher types (Bucket and High‐Attack) will appear later. \n\nPlanting a Sunflower (X) in row 1, column 6 (an empty cell) for 50 sun does exactly that. It will boost our future sun income by adding an extra 10 sun each turn. This extra economy allows us greater flexibility in the near future, for example affording a Fire Chili (F) when a row is overwhelmed or even a more powerful Three‐Line Shooter (S) if needed. Meanwhile, rows 2 and 3 are already in combat, and rows 0 and 4 have solid defenses—so row 1 is both safe enough for a new Sunflower now and will help us prepare for the challenges ahead.\n\nThus, the best move is to plant:\n Sunflower at row 1, column 6.","Answer: W 3 6\n\nI recommend planting a Peashooter (W) at row 3, column 6. This lane is under immediate pressure from a high‐attack zombie already past the wall‑nut in that row. By adding an extra shooter at the very right end, you boost firepower to help damage the “first zombie” in row 3 before it advances further and puts your key plants (like the wall‑nut in col5 or the nearby shooters) at risk.","Answer: F 3 6\n\nI suggest planting a Fire Chili in row 3, column 6. This plant costs 300 sun (within your 325 sun budget) and immediately eliminates all zombies in its row—which is especially useful since row 3 already hosts a Regular Zombie (N) next to a Wall‑nut (J) and a High‐Attack Zombie (I) in column 6. Clearing row 3 now should help slow the approaching threat before the next zombie spawn.","Answer: W 2 6; X 0 1\n\nAnalysis:\n• With 170 sun available, we want to use our resources to both boost offensive firepower in the row already under zombie pressure (row 2) and help our long‐term sun economy.\n• Placing a Peashooter (W, cost 100) in row 2 at column 6 adds extra damage in that lane—every peashooter in the row will fire at the “first” zombie (here the ones already clustered with the wall‐nut blocker in col 5) to try and thin their HP before they can reach and overrun our plants.\n• Spending the remaining 50 sun on a Sunflower (X) in an empty cell in a safe row (row 0, col 1) will boost our sun collection by +10 each turn.\nThese moves help stabilize the situation on the threatened row while bolstering sun income for future turns.","Answer: W 3 6;X 4 2","Answer: W 2 5; J 4 5\n\nI'll explain my thinking briefly:\n\n• Row2 is already under pressure—zombies are in col4 (“NI”) and col6 (with the W that’s currently bearing the brunt of B and R). Placing a Peashooter (W) into the empty cell at row2, col5 boosts the row’s firepower so it can start chipping away at the more-advanced zombies (with the “first zombie” mechanic, the one at col4 will be targeted).\n\n• Row4’s only active shooter at col6 is already sharing its cell with zombies (“WNI”), including a high‐attack zombie that deals 3 damage per turn. By planting a Wall‐nut (J) in the empty cell row4, col5, you create a tough barrier (10 HP) that will force the row4 zombies to spend extra turns before reaching your shooter.\n\nThis use of 100 sun for the peashooter and 50 sun for the wall‐nut (total 150 sun) fits well within your current 190 sun budget while strengthening both lanes.","Answer: W 2 4","Answer: H 2 6;W 4 6\n\nHere's the reasoning behind this move:\n\n• In row2 the cell at column 5 already has a Peashooter (W) that’s currently under attack by Bucket and Roadblock zombies (“BR”). By placing a Torch Stump (H) in the empty cell in column 6, you buff the W immediately to its left so that its damage increases from 1 to 2 per turn. That extra damage can help clear the zombies in that cell faster.\n\n• In row4 the cell at column 5 contains a Wall‐nut (J) that is being attacked by a Regular zombie and a High-Attack zombie (“NI”). The empty cell in column 6 is an ideal spot to plant a Peashooter (W) whose lane‐wide shot will target the leftmost zombie in that row. This should help reduce the pressure on the blocking plant.\n\nThese two moves cost 125 sun (Torch Stump) + 100 sun (Peashooter) = 225 sun in total, leaving you with 45 sun from your current 270.","Answer: X 0 2;W 2 3\n\nI’m choosing to plant a Sunflower (X) at row 0, column 2 and a Peashooter (W) at row 2, column 3. The extra sunflower will boost your sun generation further so you have more resources later on, and the extra peashooter in row 2 will help target the zombie crowd in that row (especially since one High‐Attack zombie is already present in the cell at col2 and additional zombies are nearby) before they get too close. This use of 50 + 100 = 150 sun leaves you with 50 sun for future decisions.","Answer: W 2 5\n\nI recommend planting a Peashooter in row 2, column 5. This extra shooter will join the two existing shooters on row 2 and help focus fire on the combined Bucket (B) and Roadblock (R) zombies clustered at cell (2,4). Increasing the DPS on that row is urgent given the tough zombies present there, while still keeping a bit of sun in reserve. \n\nRemember that with the current sun (215), spending 100 on a Peashooter leaves you with 115 sun for future turns—and you’ll continue earning at least 25 sun per turn plus the extra 10 sun per turn from your Sunflowers.","Answer: J 2 4;J 4 5","Answer:\n\nI have no valid placement this turn since every grid cell on the board is already occupied by a plant.","操作格式错误，应为：植物类型 行 列","Answer: F 2 6;W 3 6\n\nHere’s the reasoning behind the choice:\n\n• In row2 the cell at column 6 is empty. Row2 is currently overrun – with a Wall‐nut in col4 hosting both a Bucket and Roadblock zombie and a Peashooter in col5 facing multiple zombies – so using the Fire Chili (F) there (which costs 300 sun) will immediately eliminate all zombies in that row.\n\n• With the remaining sun (510 – 300 = 210), adding an extra attacking plant in row3 (which faces a dangerous High‐Attack zombie I at col5) is important. Placing a Peashooter (W, costing 100 sun) at row3, column 6 (an empty cell) ensures additional damage against the zombie in that row.\n\nThis move spends 300 + 100 = 400 sun, leaving you with 110 sun for upcoming turns.","I'll choose to spend 50 sun to add a Wall‐nut (J) to row1 at column6. This extra barrier will be the new “front‐line” plant for row1 so that the zombie already at col5 (sitting on a Torch Stump) won’t immediately break through—the new Wall‐nut with 10 HP should delay any further progress or a new zombie that may spawn next turn. In addition, I’ll place a Sunflower (X) in row2 at column6. Although row2 isn’t under immediate threat, the new sunflower will boost my sun income by +10 each turn, helping me afford stronger defenses later.\n\nThat uses 50 + 50 = 100 sun (leaving 165 sun remaining from 265), and the moves are legal since row1, col6 and row2, col6 are empty.\n\nThus, per the requested format, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: J 1 6; X 2 6","Answer: F 3 5","Answer: H 1 5;J 3 5\n\nHere's the thinking:  \n• In row1 the cell at column4 already has a Peashooter (W), and there’s a Regular Zombie (N) sharing the cell. By placing a Torch Stump (H) at row1 column5, its buff will immediately enhance the damage of the plant immediately to its left (the W at col4), helping it eliminate the zombie faster.  \n• In row3 the cell at column6 already has a Peashooter (W) that’s being attacked by Roadblock Zombies (R,R). Placing a Wall-nut (J) at row3 column5 (a vacant cell) will serve as an extra barrier, stalling the zombies’ progress and giving the plant at col6 extra time to deal damage.  \n\nThe total cost is 125 sun for H plus 50 sun for J (total 175 sun), which is within the available 195 sun.","Answer: W 4 6\n\nAnalysis:\nAt turn 47 you have 185 sun available and only two grid cells where you can add a plant—row3 column6 and row4 column6 (since all other cells already contain a plant). In row4 you currently face a High‐Attack Zombie (I) at column6. With its 6 HP and dangerous 3‐damage attack per turn, it threatens your backbone in that row even though a Wall‐nut (J) in column5 is present. Planting a Peashooter (W, cost 100) right in row4 column6 will immediately begin dealing 1 damage each turn to that very zombie in a row where your current shooters (at col1 and col3) may be too far back to act quickly on the imminent threat. \n\nWhile row3 contains two Roadblock Zombies (RR) at column6, they are less dangerous since they deal only 1 damage per turn, and the existing plants (X, W, and J) provide more tolerance. Thus, reinforcing row4’s offense now helps to reduce the risk from the high‐attack zombie. \n\nThis move costs 100 sun (leaving you with 85 sun), and maintains a balance between consistent sun production (thanks to your many Sunflowers) and increasing offensive pressure in the row with the most urgent threat.","Answer: W 3 6;W 4 6","Answer: \n\nNo planting move this turn.","操作格式错误，应为：植物类型 行 列","Answer: F 4 6","Answer: W 4 6","It turns out that every cell on the 5×7 board is already occupied by a plant (even in cells that also have zombies), so there isn’t any legal empty cell available on which to plant something new this turn.

Placing a Peashooter (W, cost 100 sun) in the only free cell (column 6) will become the new frontline defender that shoots down approaching zombies before they can reach the more vulnerable plants.\n\n• In row3 the zombies occupy columns 5 and 6 and are attacking a lone Peashooter at column 4. With extra sun available, placing a Wall-nut (J, cost 50 sun) in row3 column 6 gives a durable barrier (10 HP) that forces the zombies to take extra turns attacking it instead of reaching the plant behind.\n\nThis uses a total of 300 + 100 + 50 = 450 sun (leaving 25 sun) while addressing the most dangerous threats across the battlefield.","Answer: H 3 5; X 1 6\n\nAnalysis:\n• In row3 the two Roadblock zombies (R) are creating a tough situation. Although there’s already a Peashooter at col1 and another at col4 (in cell “WRR”), their combined output (1 damage each turn) will need several rounds to take down an 8‐HP Roadblock zombie. By planting a Torch Stump (H) in row3 col5, its boosting effect will immediately increase the damage of the plant immediately to its left (the Peashooter in row3 col4) from 1 to 2. This raises the total damage in row3 from 2 to 3 per turn, helping to bring down the zombie faster.\n\n• With sun at 190, after spending 125 for the Torch Stump you’d be left with 65 sun. Using 50 sun to plant a Sunflower (X) in a safe, empty cell (here chosen as row1 col6) will help generate an extra 10 sun next turn so you have more resources for future moves without compromising immediate defense.\n\nThus, planting H 3 5 and X 1 6 is an effective balance between boosting your row3 offense and increasing your sun income.","Answer: W 4 5\n\nI’ve decided to plant a Peashooter (W) at row 4, column 5. This placement uses one of the few empty cells while adding some immediate offensive capability to row 4 where zombies (including a high‐attack one and a Roadblock on an existing plant) are already present. The new Peashooter will start dealing 1 damage each turn to the foremost zombie in that row, helping to keep the immediate threats in check.","Answer: H 4 4;J 3 4\n\nI’ve decided to spend 125 sun on a Torch Stump at row4, column4 so it can immediately boost the damage of the Peashooter at row4, column5—this should help deal extra damage against the bucket zombie lurking at row4, column6. In addition, I’ll plant a Wall‐nut (costing 50 sun) in row3, column4 (an empty plant cell that currently only has a zombie) to serve as a stronger blockage against the Roadblock and high‐attack zombies advancing in row3.

Notably:\n• Row1, col6 is free of any plant (it currently holds only two Bucket zombies) but is still in a lane that isn’t as immediately dangerous.\n• Row4, col3 is also free and already occupied solely by a high‐attack (I) zombie. This zombie in row4 is much more advanced (already in column 3) and poses a greater immediate threat because if allowed to proceed it could quickly damage the vulnerable sunflowers behind it.\n\nPlanting a Wall‐nut (J) costs only 50 sun and has 10 HP—a durable blocker that can absorb several hits (even from a high‐attack zombie that deals 3 damage per turn). By placing a Wall‐nut at row4, col3, you force the high‐attack zombie to focus on it, delaying its progress and buying time for your more offensive plants on that row to deal damage.\n\nConsidering you have 265 sun this turn, spending 50 sun on a Wall‐nut in row4, col3 is a strategic defensive move that addresses an immediate threat while preserving resources for future turns.\n\nThus, the recommended move is:\n\nAnswer: J 4 3","Answer: F 1 6\n\nI decided to use a Fire Chili on row 1.

Row 3 already faces some zombies in column 2 (with two Roadblock zombies and a High‐Attack zombie) and column 4 (a Roadblock), and placing a new shooter at the far right means any zombie spawned there next (or already moving in from the far right) will immediately come under fire before they can close in further.
