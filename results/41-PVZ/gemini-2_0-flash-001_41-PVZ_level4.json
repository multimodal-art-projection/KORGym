Since it's turn 16, more Roadblock Zombies might appear.\n\nHere's my strategy:\n1. Reinforce line 2 with a Wall-nut to prevent zombies from advancing and possibly losing the game if they manage to get to the base.\n2. Add a peashooter in line 2 to deal damage.\n\nAnswer: J 2 0;W 2 1\n","Okay, I will analyze the current situation and provide the best plant placements to maximize my score and survive as long as possible.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n*   **Turn:** 17\n*   **Sun:** 125\n*   **Zombies:** Multiple Roadblock Zombies (R) are present. Need to focus on defense and damage.\n*   **Economy:** Sunflowers are generating sun.\n*   **Vulnerability:**  Right side is constantly under attack.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Strengthen Defense:** Add more Wall-nuts and upgrade the existing defense.\n2.  **Increase Damage Output:** Add more Peashooters or Three-Line Shooters where possible.\n\n**Move Selection:**\n\n```\nAnswer: J 3 1;W 2 1\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   `J 3 1`: Places a Wall-nut in row 3, column 1. This will reinforce the front line in that row, protecting the existing Sunflower.\n*   `W 2 1`: Places a Peashooter in row 2, column 1. This provides additional damage to the row and assists in taking down the Roadblock zombies.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe current board is vulnerable to the incoming Roadblock Zombies. By placing the Wall-nut in row 3, it provides an extra layer of defense for the sunflower while absorbing damage from the Roadblock zombie. The Peashooter in row 2 can start attacking the zombies and helps clear the board.\n\n","Okay, I will analyze the current situation and decide on the best plant placements for turn 18, considering my sun count, the upcoming zombie spawn on turn 20, and the general strategy of maximizing damage output and defense.\n\nCurrently I have 190 sun.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n*   **Defense:** I need to strengthen the defenses, especially against the Roadblock Zombies. Wall-nuts are relatively cheap and effective.\n*   **Offense:** More Peashooters are needed to deal damage and protect against the incoming zombies.\n*   **Sun Production:** Continue producing sun to be able to plant even more.\n\nOptimal Moves:\n\nAnswer: X 2 0;W 3 1\n","Okay, I understand the game and the current situation.

Need to strengthen defenses, especially in rows with multiple zombies.\n2.  **Sun Production:** Maintain good sun production. Sunflowers are already present, which is good.\n3.  **Damage Output:** Increase damage output to eliminate the zombies before they reach the plants.\n\nConsidering the sun available (255), and the approaching turn 20 where new zombie type will be spawned, I will focus on placing some Wall-nuts to stall zombies while also adding some damage to the lines where the Roadblock Zombies are moving.\n\nAnswer: J 0 2;W 1 2;J 3 2\n","Okay, I understand the game rules and current board state. I need to decide on a plant placement strategy for turn 21, keeping in mind my current sun (120), the zombies present, and the upcoming zombie spawn. Since it is turn 21, Bucket Zombies and High-Attack Zombies can now spawn. I also know that zombie HP increases by 4 and zombie spawn rate increases by 1 every 10 turns, so I need to brace for that at Turn 30.\n\nHere's my reasoning for this turn:\n\n*   **Line 2 needs defense:** Line 2 currently only has a Peashooter to defend against zombies. This is not enough as zombie health has increased by 4.\n\n*   **Sun is still limited:** I have 120 sun, so I need to be careful with spending.\n\nConsidering these factors, my action for this turn is to reinforce Line 2.\n\nAnswer: W 2 1\n","Okay, I understand the game rules and the current battlefield.

Lines 0 and 1 have Roadblock Zombies.\n*   **Defense Weakness:** Line 2 needs immediate reinforcement. The rest of the lines are somewhat okay.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nGiven the zombie pressure on Line 2 and available sun, I'll focus on strengthening that line. Placing a Peashooter will help deal with the High-Attack Zombies and the Regular Zombie. I can also add a Wall-nut in front of the zombies to buy some time.\n\n**Action:**\n\n```\nAnswer: W 2 1; J 2 0\n```\n\n","Okay, I will analyze the current situation and provide the best plant placement strategy for Turn 24.\n\n**Analysis of the Current Board:**\n\n*   **Line 0:** Sunflower and Wallnut are being heavily attacked.\n*   **Line 1:** Sunflower and Wallnut are being heavily attacked.\n*   **Line 2:** The Peashooter is dealing with a NII zombie mix.\n*   **Line 3:** Wall-nuts provide good defense.\n*   **Line 4:** Peashooter is relatively safe for now.\n\n**Priorities:**\n\n1.  **Defense:** The most pressing issue is the attack on lines 0 and 1.

The Wall-nut in row 3 is low on health and has 2 Zombies in its square. Replenishing the Wall-nut is critical, to avoid damage to the sunflowers in row 3.\n\n**Proposed Actions:**\n\n*   Plant Torch Stump in Row 2 Column 1: H 2 1 (Costs 125 sun, combines with Peashooter in line 2 to deal more damage)\n*   Plant Wall-nut in Row 3 Column 2: J 3 2 (Costs 50 sun, to replace existing low health Wall-nut)\n\n**Answer:** H 2 1;J 3 2\n","Answer: W 2 1;S 3 1\n","Okay, I will analyze the current situation and provide the best plant placement strategy for turn 25.\n\n**Analysis of the Current Board:**\n\n*   **Line 0:** Two Wall-nuts and a Peashooter are present.

Therefore, zombies now have +4 HP from turn 10 and +4 HP from turn 20, so all zombies have +8 HP. Also, two zombies spawn every 5 turns after turn 10, and 3 zombies spawn every 5 turns after turn 20. A new wave of zombies is about to spawn.\n*   **Zombie Types:** Regular (N), Roadblock (R), Bucket (B), and High-Attack (I) zombies are all present.\n*   **Weak Points:** Line 4 looks extremely vulnerable because of the large stack of zombies. Line 0 also looks vulnerable, with the wall-nut about to be taken down.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nPrioritize strengthening vulnerable lines and maintaining sun production. A Fire Chili on line 4 is going to clear the path to the base.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Fire Chili:** Place a Fire Chili in Line 4 to clear the zombie stack.\n2.  **Wall-nut:** Place a Wall-nut in Line 0 to protect against the zombies.\n\n**Answer:** F 4 0;J 0 0\n"],"prompt":"\nIn the following, you are required to participate in a simplified version of the Plants vs. Zombies game. The game is played on a 5×7 board, where zombies spawn from the far right side and move one step to the left each turn. The types of plants and zombies are as follows:\n\nPlants  \n- Sunflower (X): Costs 50 sun, has 2 HP, and generates an extra 10 sun each turn.  \n- Peashooter (W): Costs 100 sun, has 2 HP, and deals 1 damage each turn to the first zombie in its current row.  \n- Three-Line Shooter (S): Costs 325 sun, has 2 HP, and deals 1 damage each turn to the first zombie in its current row as well as the first zombie in each of the adjacent rows.  \n- Wall-nut (J): Costs 50 sun and has 10 HP.  \n- Torch Stump (H): Costs 125 sun, has 2 HP; it increases the damage of the plant to its left in the same row (applied directly to the plant rather than to a projectile) by +1, and this effect can only be applied once.  \n- Fire Chili (F): Costs 300 sun and eliminates all zombies in its row.\n\nZombies  \n- Regular Zombie (N): Has 4 HP and deals 1 damage each turn to the plant that blocks its path.  \n- Roadblock Zombie (R): Has 8 HP and deals 1 damage each turn to the plant that blocks its path.  \n- Bucket Zombie (B): Has 12 HP and deals 1 damage each turn to the plant that blocks its path.  \n- High-Attack Zombie (I): Has 6 HP and deals 3 damage each turn to the plant that blocks its path.\n\nRules  \n- At least 25 sun is gained each turn.\n- A new zombie is spawned every 5 turns.\n- After every 10 turns, newly spawned zombies have their HP increased by 4, and the number of zombies spawned increases by 1.\n- Your score increases by 1 each turn.\n- The game lasts for a maximum of 100 turns.\n- Plants cannot be placed on the same grid cell, but zombies can coexist in the same cell.\n- There are no lawn mowers.\n- Roadblock Zombies only spawn after turn 10, and Bucket Zombies and High-Attack Zombies only spawn after turn 20.\n\nPlease input in the format \"PlantType Row Column\".
