Peashooter costs 100 sun, but since we only have 65 sun right now, we can't place it this turn. Instead, I'll plant an additional **Sunflower (X)** to boost future sun production. I'll also prepare to deal with the threat from the zombie next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Turn Plan**: Add a Sunflower to Line 1 at column 0.

The Torch Stump buffs nearby Peashooter for +1 damage.\n- **Row 3**: A Sunflower and Wall-nut. Another Wall-nut is being attacked by a Zombie in this row.\n- **Row 4**: A Sunflower is present with no other offense or defense.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n1. **Sun Management**: You have a total of 150 sun, and you are passively generating +25 sun per turn. Each Sunflower adds +10 more. Currently, you are gaining 65 sun per turn.\n2. **Zombie Threats**: \n   - Row 2: A Zombie is engaged with a Wall-nut.\n   - Row 3: A Wall-nut is protecting another Zombie attack.\n\n### Planting Strategy for This Turn:\n1. Add **offensive plants** to rows with oncoming zombies (Rows 2 and 3).\n2. Add **defensive plants** (Wall-nuts) if there is a risk of zombies breaking through.\n3.

No direct damage plants are present.\n- **Line2**: The Torch Stump (H) boosts the Peashooter (W) here, but multiple zombies (JN) are gathered. Line2 might need some reinforcements soon due to their strong position.\n- **Line3**: A Regular Zombie (JN) is advancing. There's some minor defense, but more firepower might be needed as things escalate.\n- **Line4**: Currently clear, but we should prepare for potential future spawns.\n\n### Resources:\nYou have **115 sun**. This allows for strategic placement of lower-cost plants. Sunflowers can help boost income for the next waves, and strategically adding Wall-nuts or offensive plants will create defensible zones.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Plant a **Peashooter (W)** in **Line1, Column1** to deal consistent damage to the advancing Roadblock Zombie.\n2.

You are on Turn 17, meaning stronger zombies will appear soon.\n\n### Plan:\nUse the available sun to fortify key positions. Line4 lacks an attacker, so focusing on that is important. The zombies in Line2 are already countered by defensive Wall-nuts. Use Fire Chili if zombies on Line0 and Line1 threaten to advance further, but it may not be needed this turn.\n\n### Action:\nI will plant a Peashooter in Line4 to ensure defense and potentially add a Wall-nut as backup.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: W 4 2","Considering that the Sun balance is 145 and we want to maximize protection and maintain offense against zombies.

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Sun required for Fire Chili (`F`)**: 300 sun. You currently have 75 sun but gain at least 25 sun passively at the start of each turn. Additionally, you have 4 Sunflowers (`X`), each generating 10 sun per turn, which results in 40 sun extra per turn. This brings your total sun for the next turn to **75 + 25 + 40 = 140**, so spending resources now will prepare you for more aggressive choices later. You gain longer turns","Let’s evaluate the situation before making a decision:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Sun Accumulation:**\n   - You have 140 suns at the start of turn 21.\n   - Current **Sunflower Setup (X):**\n     - Line1, Line2, Line3, Line4 each have a single Sunflower, generating +40 sun per turn (10 sun × 4 Sunflowers).\n   - You gain a base 25 suns each turn.  \n   - Total sun generation per turn is **65 sun** (25 + 40).\n\n2. **Zombie Threats:**\n   - **Line0:** Bucket Zombie at the far end (HP = 12), WR at column 1. Peashooter is already dealing damage to WR, but its attack is weak. If unresisted, the zombies will soon overtake your defenses.\n   - **Line2:** Bucket Zombie at the far end (HP = 12), but this row has more plant defenses (W, J, H).\n   - **Line3:** Regular Zombie (HP = 4) is already at column 2. Walls and damage sources are blocking it for now.\n   - **Line4:** Bucket Zombie (HP = 12) at the far end.\n   - **Line1:** No active zombie threat yet.\n\n3. **Damage Assessment:**\n   - Peashooter = 1 damage per turn.\n   - Torch Stump amplifies Peashooters on its left to deal **2 damage per turn.**\n   - Bucket Zombies have high HP (12), meaning multiple plants or strategic placement is necessary.\n   - Regular Zombie will be handled in Line3 soon.\n\n4. **Plant Placement Strategy:**\n   - Protect vulnerable rows (Line0 and Line4).\n   - Add firepower to deal with high-HP zombies before they reach your plants.\n   - Strategic placement of Fire Chili (F) to clear rows if overwhelmed.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Place **Three-Line Shooter (S)** for multi-line damage coverage, where cost-effective.\n2. Place **Fire Chili (F)** to deal with heavy zombie clusters.\n3. Add **Wall-nut (J)** to buy time in critical lanes.\n\n### Answer:\n\"Answer: F 0 6; S 1 3\"  \nExplanation:  \n1. Fire Chili (F) in Line0 eliminates the Bucket Zombie and clears the threat to the top row.  \n2.

You have 75 sun to work with.\n2. Turn 9, so this turn is before zombies scale up from turn 10.\n3. Sunflowers are generating extra sun each turn. Currently, you have 3 sunflowers.\n4. There's a regular zombie (N) in Line3, Column 3. On the next turn, it will move left to Column 2 and attack the Wall-nut.\n\n**Plan:** The primary focus is defending Line3 because the zombie is a threat to the Wall-nut. Additionally, it would be helpful to reinforce other lines with offensive plants where possible.\n\n**Action:**:\n- Place another Peashooter in Line1, Column1 to increase damage in that row.\n- Sunflower in Line4, Column0 to generate more sun.\n\n**Answer:** W 1 1; X 4 0","To maximize efficiency, consider the current resources, battlefield situation, and upcoming threats. You have 90 sun, and zombies spawn every 5 turns, with increasing strength over time. Your goal is to maintain sufficient defenses and generate enough sun while surviving for as long as possible.\n\n### Current Observations:\n1. **Line3** is under attack by a Regular Zombie (N) with 4 HP. The Wall-nut (J) will block damage for 10 turns, but the Peashooter (W) can only deal 1 damage per turn, taking 4 turns to eliminate the zombie.\n2. **Sunflower farms** (three in total) are producing 30 sun per turn. The sun collection rate is sufficient for now, though expanding sun production might be beneficial as tougher zombies appear.\n3. Lines 0, 1, and 2 have no offensive plants. Line 4 has a Peashooter for basic defense.\n\n### Strategy:\n- Expand sun production to prepare for stronger zombies in upcoming turns.\n- Place offensive plants (e.g., Peashooters or Three-Line Shooters) to bolster defense where needed.\n- Prepare for Roadblock Zombies (R) starting from turn 10.\n\n---\n\n### Proposed Action:\n1. **Place one Sunflower** in an open spot to increase sun production.\n2. **Strengthen weak rows (Lines 0, 1, and 2)** by starting to add Peashooters for basic defense.\n\n---\n\n### Answer:\n**X 1 0; W 0 1**\n\nExplanation:\n- Placing a Sunflower (X) in **Line1, Column0** boosts sun production starting next turn.\n- Adding a Peashooter (W) in **Line0, Column1** begins fortifying Line0's offense against future zombies.","Turn:11 | Sun:115 | Score:11\n\nTo make the most efficient use of resources and defend against the zombies, I'll focus on improving firepower in the rows where zombies are present. In this case, I will plant a Wall-nut (J) to slow down the zombie in Line 0, and I will plant a Peashooter (W) to prepare for defense.\n\n**Answer**: J 0 2; W 0 1","Let's evaluate the current state of the battlefield and implement a strategy.\n\n### Observations:\n1. You have **140 sun** and gain sun from both the turn and your 5 Sunflowers (each generating 10 sun per turn), so a total of **50 sun + 25 base = 75 sun** next turn.\n2. There’s a Regular Zombie (N) at **(0, 5)** and **(4, 5)**. Both have 4 HP and will advance next turn.\n3. There is no immediate danger to your plants in rows 1, 2, and 3.\n\n### Strategy:\n- Prioritize dealing with zombies that have advanced farthest on the grid (Rows 0 and 4).\n- Enhance firepower using Peashooters or synergy combinations (Torch Stump + Peashooter).\n- Maintain sun economy.\n\n### Action Plan:\n- Place a **Peashooter (W)** at (0, 3) to target the zombie on Line 0.\n- Place a **Torch Stump (H)** at (4, 2) to boost the existing Peashooter on Line 4.\n- Save the remaining sun for future turns.\n\n### Answer:\nAnswer: W 0 3; H 4 2","Here, based on the situation, I will propose moves focused on optimizing resource generation and strategizing against approaching zombies. The goal is to place plants that balance sun production while defending effectively.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Sunlight Generation**:\n  We currently have 5 Sunflowers (X), each producing 10 sun per turn. Next turn, at least 25 sun will be added along with the 50 from the Sunflowers, so we’ll have 190 sun next turn.\n- **Zombies**:\n  - Line 0 has a Regular Zombie (N) at position (4). W (Peashooter) will deal 1 damage. It'll move to position (3) next turn if not destroyed.\n  - Line 4 has another Regular Zombie (N) at position (4). We have a Peashooter (W) there too.\n- **Defense**:\n  Current plants are placing mild defense (Peashooters and Wall-nuts) but might need reinforcements to prevent breakthroughs as spawn rate increases.\n\n### Move:\nGiven the sun available (115), I recommend reinforcing defenses strategically to deal damage and prepare for better handling of zombies.\n\n**Answer:** W 1 3; W 2 3\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Peashooter (W)**:\n  - Placing one Peashooter in line 1 and one in line 2 increases our offensive capabilities in those lanes to fend off new zombies that will eventually spawn.\n","### Analysis:\n1. **Current Sun**: 90 sun available. We gain at least 25 sun per turn, and the four Sunflowers (Line0, Line1, Line2, Line3) generate 10 sun each, adding up to 40 sun.

Based on your current sun generation and the situation, let's add another Sunflower to increase your resources for future turns.\n\n### Suggested Move:\n\"Answer: X 4 0\"\n\nExplanation:  \nPlacing a Sunflower ensures you gain additional sun each turn, which will be crucial for later turns as stronger zombies (e.g., Roadblock Zombies and High-Attack Zombies) begin to spawn. The current battlefield does not yet require immediate offensive plants, as no zombies are directly threatening your most critical plants (e.g., the Sunflowers). This strategy ensures long-term sustainability.","行和列必须为整数。","Before making a move, let's analyze the battlefield:\n\n1. **Sun Count**: 95, sun is gained at least 25 per turn, plus an additional 10 from each existing Sunflower (two Sunflowers = +20 sun). So, at the beginning of the next turn, we'll have at least \\(95 + 25 + 20 = 140\\) sun.\n2. **Score**: 7 turns have passed, so the score is 7.\n3. **Zombie Threats**: \n   - **Line 0**: There is one Regular Zombie (**N**) blocked by a Wall-nut (**J**) and a Peashooter (**W**) that deals 1 damage per turn.  \n   - **Line 3**: There is one Regular Zombie (**N**) still advancing (now in column 5) with no plant attacking it.  \n\n### Strategy:\n- Since zombies are advancing, it's critical to protect exposed lines while continuing to deal damage. Planting a Peashooter can help eliminate zombies effectively.\n- It's also wise to invest in more Sunflowers to generate additional sun for stronger plants in future turns.\n\n### Action Plan:\n- Place another Sunflower on **Line 1, Column 0** to increase sun production.\n- Place a Peashooter on **Line 3, Column 4** to start attacking the zombie in that row.\n\n### Input:\nAnswer: X 1 0; W 3 4","Here’s the best move considering your sun and the battlefield:\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Current Sun Production:**  \n   - You gain 25 sun per turn.

A Wall-nut is already in place but would be worn down eventually. We should consider some firepower here.\n2. **Line 1**: A Wall-nut (J) and Peashooter (W) setup may suffice for now; however, the zombies are closing in, so the Peashooter's time to act is limited.\n3. **Line 3**: A Regular Zombie (N) is making its way across. Damage may be imminent if additional firepower isn’t set up.\n4. **Line 4**: There's no zombie threat here yet, but defensive preparation may be wise before zombies spawn.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Plant a **Torch Stump (H)** in **Line 1, Column 0** to enhance the Peashooter (W) in Line 1. This will grant an extra +1 damage to defeat zombies faster.\n2. Reinforce the defense by adding a **Wall-nut (J)** to Line 3, Column 4 to delay the Regular Zombie's advance until more firepower can be applied there.\n3.

This will provide 10 extra sun per turn, increasing our build-up speed. Middle rows are strategic as you can defend or attack zombies efficiently in the early stage. \n\nLet’s see how the game evolves.","To maximize sun generation and prepare for future defense, placing another Sunflower will be crucial in the early game. We will also strategize plant placements to handle zombies effectively once higher-threat enemies appear.\n\n**Answer:** X 3 0  \n\n### Explanation:\n- Placing another Sunflower generates additional sun each turn, allowing for stronger plants to be placed as the game progresses.\n- The zombie on Line 4 (Regular Zombie) is still far away, so immediate offensive plants or defensive actions are unnecessary this turn.\n\nTurn: 2 | Sun:35 | Score: 2\n\nCurrent Battlefield:\nLine0|0  |0  |0  |0  |0  |0  |0  \nLine1|0  |0  |0  |0  |0  |0  |0  \nLine2|X  |0  |0  |0  |0  |0  |0  \nLine3|X  |0  |0  |0  |0  |0  |0  \nLine4|0  |0  |0  |0  |0  |0  |N  ","Turn:2 | Sun:70 | Score: 2  \n\nAt this point, I have 70 sun available and need to make strategic placements to defend against the zombie in Line4 while building sun production for future turns.\n\n**Plan:**  \n- Place another Sunflower to increase sun production.  \n- Place a temporary defensive plant to block the zombie in Line4.\n\n**Answer:** X 3 0; J 4 0  \n\nExplanation:  \n- Placing Sunflower (X) at Line3 Column0 boosts sun production to get more resources in future turns.  \n- Placing Wall-nut (J) at Line4 Column0 ensures defense against the zombie while I save sun for stronger plants like Peashooters. Wall-nut has high HP and will stall the zombie effectively.","In the current state, you have 65 sun and a Regular Zombie (N) on Line4 approaching from the right side. The Sunflowers in Line2 and Line3 will generate 20 more sun next turn (10 each), giving you a total of 85 sun next turn if left unchanged. Since you need to deal with the zombie and ensure survival, I will place a Peashooter. \n\nAnswer: W 4 0","To strategically play this turn, I recommend planting a Peashooter (W) in a row where the zombie is approaching, as it will deal damage each turn and help defend against the Regular Zombie. Here's my suggestion:\n\n**Answer:** W 4 1  \n\nExplanation:  \n- A Peashooter (W) costs 100 sun, and you currently have 110 sun. This leaves you with 10 sun after planting the Peashooter.  \n- The Peashooter is placed in **Line 4**, where the zombie has spawned, to inflict damage on the Regular Zombie.  \n- You will gain 25 sun at the end of this turn, plus 10 sun from each Sunflower (20 total sun from the two Sunflowers on Lines 2 and 3), increasing your sun reserve for the next turn.  \n\nTurn efficiently while preparing for possible zombie spawns in other rows moving forward.","Since this is turn 5, you currently have 55 sun, and the zombies have started spawning from the far-right column.

Here's the analysis of the battlefield and what we can do:\n\n- **Sun Received**: Currently, we have 105 sun. With 4 Sunflowers in play, we will gain an additional 40 sun this turn, bringing us to **145 sun**. Adding the default turn sun (+25), we will have **170 sun** to spend.\n- **Zombies**: The Regular Zombie (N) in Line 0 is already in range of the Peashooter (W) in its row and will take 1 damage per turn. The zombie's current health is 4, and this damage combined with Wall-nut placement should effectively delay the threat.\n  \nBased on the above, I propose the following move:\n\n### Plan:\n1. Add a **Wall-nut (J)** in Line 0 at Column 3 to block the immediate threat of the Regular Zombie.\n2. Place another **Peashooter (W)** somewhere strategic to prepare for future zombies.\n\n### Move:\nAnswer: J 0 3; W 4 2","Let's plan the move based on available sun, current game state, and turn dynamics.  \n\nWe have 120 sun and the current battlefield has zombies on the far right of Line 0. A good strategy is to reinforce the defense and plant further attackers where needed. Especially since Roadblock Zombies are now spawning from turn 10 onwards, having powerful offensive plants is critical.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Sunflowers Needed:** Sunflowers generate extra sun each turn, and additional sun may be beneficial as tougher zombies begin to appear.  \n2. **Defenses:** The zombie in Line 0 is dangerous, but can be delayed or destroyed by adequate firepower. Using Wall-nuts can be effective for stalling.\n3. **Offense:** The Peashooter and Torch Stump combo can be reinforced, or stronger plants like Three-Line Shooters can target adjacent rows. If desperate, Fire Chili can clear an entire row.\n\n### Move:\nWe will add a Wall-nut to Line 0 for defense, and invest in a Three-Line Shooter in Line 3 for multi-row offense.

Since the Peashooter is already attacking, and a Wall-nut is present, we need to **bolster defense or deal more damage**.\n2. **Line 1:** Line 1 has one Regular Zombie (`N`) and one High-Attack Zombie (`I`). There is a Sunflower (`X`) generating sun as well as Peashooters in the line. Defense here seems fair, but reinforcement might be needed soon.\n3. **Line 2:** A Roadblock Zombie (`R`) is present, and a Peashooter (`WR`) is attacking it. Defense in this line seems balanced.\n4. **Line 3:** A combination of zombies needs more resistance. The Wall-nut and Peashooter combo requires backup.\n5. **Line 4:** A Bucket Zombie (`BB`) is in this row, and a Torch Stump increases damage. Defense is already present.\n\n### Strategy:\nDeploy stronger damage-dealing units, protect weak units, and generate more sun for future turns. With **530 sun**, we'll prioritize attacking key threats like High-Attack Zombies or Roadblock Zombies.\n\n### My Answer:\n**Line 0:** Place a Wall-nut in front of the High-Attack Zombie.\n**Line 1:** Deploy a Peashooter for additional offense.\n  \n...new’s bound! anticipat to sun “","操作格式错误，应为：植物类型 行 列"],"prompt":"\nIn the following, you are required to participate in a simplified version of the Plants vs. Zombies game.

It may require immediate attention as well.\n3. **Plant Placement**:\n   - Consider placing a **Fire Chili (F)** on Line 2 to address the cluster of high-HP zombies.\n   - Line 4 may benefit from reinforcement to delay the advancing zombies.\n\n### Plan for Turn 44:\n- Use a **Fire Chili** on **Line 2** to eliminate heavy threats (R and B).\n- Place a **Peashooter (W)** or **Wall-nut (J)** on **Line 4** to stall incoming zombies.\n- Add a **Torch Stump (H)** or extra offensive plants in strategic positions to increase damage output.\n\n### Answer:\n**Answer**: F 2 0; J 4 2","Let's analyze the battlefield:  \n\n1. **Line 0**:  \n    - A Bucket Zombie (B) poses the most immediate threat with 12 HP.\n    - The Peashooters (W) in this row currently deal only 2 damage collectively per turn.\n    - Boosting their damage with a Torch Stump (H) would be ideal.\n\n2. **Line 1**:  \n    - All zombies have yet to spawn in this row, but the defensive position is relatively weak with only Sunflowers and a Wall-nut.  \n    - Placing any offensive plants could be considered if the sun amount allows.\n\n3. **Line 2**:  \n    - A Roadblock Zombie (R), Regular Zombie (N), and Bucket Zombie (B) occupy this line, making it very dangerous.  \n    - They collectively deal 1 damage per turn to the Wall-nut (which has 10 HP remaining).  \n    - A Fire Chili (F) could immediately eliminate all zombies here.\n\n4. **Line 3**:  \n    - Two Peashooters are present, and a Roadblock Zombie (R) is the main threat.  \n    - Additional offensive plants or reinforcement might be needed.  \n\n5. **Line 4**:  \n    - Three Roadblock Zombies in this row might overwhelm the defense shortly.\n    - A Fire Chili (F) here could deal with all threats immediately.\n\n### Strategic Analysis of Available Resources:\n- Current Sun: **340**  \n- Fire Chili (F) costs 300 and can clear a row, which makes it a top priority for rows under serious threat (Line 2 and Line 4).  \n- Torch Stump (H) costs 125 and can boost adjacent Peashooters in Line 0.  \n- Regular Peashooters (W) cost 100 and could be placed in strategic positions for sustained damage output.\n\n---\n\n### Plan:\n1. Use **Fire Chili (F)** in **Line 2** to eliminate the immediate zombie threat.\n2. Use **Fire Chili (F)** in **Line 4** to clear all zombies as well.\n3. Save remaining sun for the next turn.\n\n### Final Move:\n**Answer: F 2 0;F 4 0**\n\n","Given the situation, my priority is to ensure survival while maximizing damage output to clear out zombies, particularly focusing on rows with zombies closest to the left. I also need to strategically use resources and ensure the sun economy remains strong with sunflowers. Here's my planned action for turn 46:\n\n### Planned Actions:\n- **Row 2** is critical, as there are four zombies (R, B, I, RB) advancing. I will plant a **Fire Chili in Row 2** to clear all zombies, as it is the most threatening row.  \n- **Row 4** has advancing zombies (XR and R). Zombies are still at bay, but I must prepare for their advance. I can afford to plant a **Torch Stump (H)** to strengthen **W** in **Row 4, Column 4** (W in Line 4).  \n- Additional **Sunflowers (X)** will be planted to ensure a steady flow of sun in future turns. Specifically, place **Sunflower (X)** in **Row 0, Column 4** to utilize an empty spot.\n\n### Answer:  \nF 2 2; H 4 4; X 0 4","To proceed with a strategy, let's evaluate the current battlefield and decide how to proceed on turn 47. Here's the situation:\n\n1. **Sun Available:** 85 sun is currently available.\n2. **Plant State:**\n   - Sunflowers (X) are generating extra sun, so we're in a reasonable sun-gaining position.\n   - There are Peashooters (W) providing steady damage.\n   - Torch Stump (H) in row 4 is boosting the Peashooter next to it.\n3. **Zombie Threats:**\n   - **Row 0:** A Bucket Zombie (B) near your column 2. Needs significant damage.\n   - **Row 3:** A Roadblock Zombie (R) in column 6 and a Regular Zombie (N) in column 7 (behind it).\n   - **Row 4:** Two Roadblock Zombies (R) at column 0 (close to the Sunflower).\n\n### Strategy for this Turn:\nWe need a balance between offense, defense, and sun generation to handle the incoming threats. **Priority** is to deal with the high-HP zombies and prevent damage to the plants providing sun. Wall-nuts can act as shields while Peashooters and Torch Stump deal damage.\n\n### Move Plan:\n- Plant a **Peashooter (W)** in row 4, column 2, to add offensive capability to deal with the Roadblock Zombies in this row.\n- Plant a **Wall-nut (J)** in row 0, column 3, to block the Bucket Zombie on row 0.\n\nThese moves will cost us **50 sun (Wall-nut) + 100 sun (Peashooter) = 150 sun**, but we only have 85 sun now. Thus, focus on Walljectionsrow yourselves Slightty"],"prompt":"\nIn the following, you are required to participate in a simplified version of the Plants vs. Zombies game. The game is played on a 5×7 board, where zombies spawn from the far right side and move one step to the left each turn. The types of plants and zombies are as follows:\n\nPlants  \n- Sunflower (X): Costs 50 sun, has 2 HP, and generates an extra 10 sun each turn.  \n- Peashooter (W): Costs 100 sun, has 2 HP, and deals 1 damage each turn to the first zombie in its current row.  \n- Three-Line Shooter (S): Costs 325 sun, has 2 HP, and deals 1 damage each turn to the first zombie in its current row as well as the first zombie in each of the adjacent rows.  \n- Wall-nut (J): Costs 50 sun and has 10 HP.  \n- Torch Stump (H): Costs 125 sun, has 2 HP; it increases the damage of the plant to its left in the same row (applied directly to the plant rather than to a projectile) by +1, and this effect can only be applied once.  \n- Fire Chili (F): Costs 300 sun and eliminates all zombies in its row.\n\nZombies  \n- Regular Zombie (N): Has 4 HP and deals 1 damage each turn to the plant that blocks its path.  \n- Roadblock Zombie (R): Has 8 HP and deals 1 damage each turn to the plant that blocks its path.  \n- Bucket Zombie (B): Has 12 HP and deals 1 damage each turn to the plant that blocks its path.  \n- High-Attack Zombie (I): Has 6 HP and deals 3 damage each turn to the plant that blocks its path.\n\nRules  \n- At least 25 sun is gained each turn.\n- A new zombie is spawned every 5 turns.\n- After every 10 turns, newly spawned zombies have their HP increased by 4, and the number of zombies spawned increases by 1.\n- Your score increases by 1 each turn.\n- The game lasts for a maximum of 100 turns.\n- Plants cannot be placed on the same grid cell, but zombies can coexist in the same cell.\n- There are no lawn mowers.\n- Roadblock Zombies only spawn after turn 10, and Bucket Zombies and High-Attack Zombies only spawn after turn 20.\n\nPlease input in the format \"PlantType Row Column\".
