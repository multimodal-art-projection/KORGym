Will gain 25 (base) + 2 * 10 (Sunflowers) = 45 sun. Total sun for planting: 55 + 45 = 100.\n*   **Threats:** A Regular Zombie (N) with 4 HP is at (2, 2).\n*   **Defense:** A Peashooter (W) at (2, 1) with 2 HP.\n*   **Prediction:**\n    *   Peashooter shoots N: N HP becomes 4 - 1 = 3.\n    *   N moves from (2, 2) to (2, 1).\n    *   Next turn (Turn 6), N (3 HP) will attack the Peashooter (2 HP). Peashooter attacks N (3 -> 2 HP). Peashooter HP (2 -> 1 HP). N stays at (2,1).\n    *   Turn 7: Peashooter attacks N (2 -> 1 HP). N attacks Peashooter (1 -> 0 HP). Peashooter dies. N moves to (2,0).\n    *   The zombie will then destroy the Sunflower at (2, 0). This is not ideal.\n*   **Zombie Spawn:** A new zombie (N, 4 HP) spawns this turn at column 6 in a random row.\n\n**Strategy:**\nWe need to protect the Peashooter and Sunflower in Row 2. The most effective way is to place a defensive plant in front of the Peashooter. A Wall-nut (J) costs 50 sun and has 10 HP. Placing it at (2, 2) would block the incoming zombie.\n\n**Available Sun:** 100\n**Planting Options:**\n1.  **Wall-nut (J) at (2, 2):** Costs 50 sun. Blocks the zombie, saves the Peashooter. Remaining Sun: 100 - 50 = 50. This seems like the best immediate action.\n2.  **Sunflower (X):** Costs 50 sun. Could plant at (0,0), (3,0), or (4,0) to boost economy. Remaining Sun: 50. Doesn't address the immediate threat.\n3.  **Peashooter (W):** Costs 100 sun. Could plant in another row to prepare for the new zombie, e.g., (0,1), (3,1), (4,1). Remaining Sun: 0. Doesn't help Row 2 directly.\n\n**Decision:** Prioritize defense on the threatened row. Plant a Wall-nut.\n\n**Answer:** J 2 2","Answer: X 0 0","Answer: J 0 3","Answer: X 1 0","Answer: W 1 1","Answer:","Answer: W 3 1","Answer: J 3 2","Answer: X 4 0","```plant\nAnswer: W 0 1\n```","```\nAnswer: X 4 1;J 4 2\n```","Answer: J 0 2","Answer: W 3 0","Answer: X 4 2","Answer: H 1 2","Answer: X 4 0;X 4 1","Okay, let's analyze the board and plan the next move.\n\n**Turn Analysis:**\n- **Turn:** 21\n- **Sun:** 170\n- **Threats:**\n    - **Line 0:** A Normal Zombie (N) with current HP (Base 4 + 8 Bonus = 12 HP) is attacking the Wall-nut (J) at (0,2). The Peashooter (W) at (0,1) is attacking it (1 dmg\/turn). The Wall-nut has 10 HP and takes 1 dmg\/turn. Two N zombies are far back at (0,6).\n    - **Line 1:** An N zombie (12 HP) is attacking the Torch Stump (H) at (1,2). H has 2 HP and takes 1 dmg\/turn, so it will likely be destroyed next turn. The Peashooter (W) at (1,1) is buffed by H, dealing 2 dmg\/turn to the N.\n    - **Line 2:** Clear for now. Wall-nut (J) is at (2,2).\n    - **Line 3:** An N zombie (12 HP) is attacking the Wall-nut (J) at (3,2). The Peashooter (W) at (3,1) is attacking it (1 dmg\/turn). The Wall-nut has 10 HP and takes 1 dmg\/turn.\n    - **Line 4:** A Bucket Zombie (B) with current HP (Base 12 + 8 Bonus = 20 HP) is at (4,6). This line only has Sunflowers and needs defense.\n- **Sun Generation:** 5 Sunflowers (5 * 10 = 50) + Base 25 = 75 sun next turn.\n\n**Priorities:**\n1.  **Defend Line 4:** The Bucket Zombie (B) is a high-HP threat with no current defense targeting it. A Peashooter is needed.\n2.  **Manage Line 1:** The Torch Stump (H) is about to fall. Once it does, the N zombie will attack W(1,1), which only has 2 HP.\n3.  **Bolster Lines 0 & 3:** The Wall-nuts are taking damage, and the single Peashooters are slow against the current N zombies (12 HP).\n\n**Strategy:**\n- The most urgent need is defense on Line 4. Placing a Peashooter there is critical.\n- The Torch Stump (H) on Line 1 is likely doomed (1 HP left vs 1 damage). Planting something else on Line 1 won't save it immediately as the N is already attacking it.\n- We have 170 sun. Planting a Peashooter (W) costs 100 sun.\n\n**Action:**\n- Plant a Peashooter (W) on Line 4, Column 3 to start damaging the incoming Bucket Zombie. This costs 100 sun.\n\n**Remaining Sun:** 170 - 100 = 70 sun.\n\n**Options for Remaining Sun:**\n- **Save:** Have 70 + 75 = 145 sun next turn. This allows planting a Torch Stump (H) (125 sun) next turn to bolster damage on Line 0 or 3, or another Peashooter (W).\n- **Plant Sunflower (X):** Costs 50 sun. Place at (2,3)? Remaining sun 20. Next turn: 20 + 75 + 10 = 105 sun. Less flexible than saving.\n- **Plant Wall-nut (J):** Costs 50 sun. Place at (0,3) or (3,3) as backup? Remaining sun 20. Next turn: 20 + 75 = 95 sun. Also less flexible.\n\nSaving the 70 sun seems strategically best to allow for a more expensive plant like a Torch Stump next turn.\n\n**Move:** Plant Peashooter at Row 4, Column 3.\n\nAnswer: W 4 3","Answer: J 4 4;W 0 3","```markdown\n","Answer: W 4 2;X 1 3","```\nAnswer: J 0 2;W 4 3\n```","Answer: F 4 5","```markdown\nAnalyzing the board:\n- **Row 0:** A Wall-nut (J) at (0, 2) with 10 HP is being attacked by two Regular Zombies (N), each with 4+8=12 HP. The Peashooter (W) at (0, 1) deals 1 damage per turn. The J will take 2 damage per turn and fall in 5 turns (10 HP \/ 2 DMG). The W deals 1 damage, taking 12 turns to kill one N. This row needs more damage soon.\n- **Row 1:** Good setup with a buffed Peashooter (W+H). No immediate threats.\n- **Row 2:** A Wall-nut (J) at (2, 2) with 10 HP. A High-Attack Zombie (I) with 6+8=14 HP is at (2, 5). It deals 3 damage per turn. The Peashooter (W) at (2, 1) deals 1 damage per turn. The I zombie will reach the J in 3 turns (moves to 4, 3, then 2). Once it reaches the J, the J will last 4 turns (10 HP \/ 3 DMG). The W deals 1 damage\/turn. In the 3 turns travel + 4 turns attacking J = 7 turns, the W will deal 7 damage. This is not enough to kill the 14 HP zombie, and the J will fall, followed quickly by the W and X due to the high damage. This is the most critical threat.\n- **Row 3:** A Wall-nut (J) at (10 HP) at (3, 2). A Bucket Zombie (B) with 12+8=20 HP is at (3, 5). It deals 1 damage per turn. Two Peashooters (W) at (3, 0) and (3, 1) deal a total of 2 damage per turn. The B zombie will reach the J in 3 turns. The J will last 10 turns (10 HP \/ 1 DMG). The Ws deal 2 damage\/turn. It will take 10 turns to kill the B zombie. The zombie will be killed just as it destroys the J. This is manageable but could use improvement later.\n- **Row 4:** Good setup, no immediate threats.\n\nSun: 110. Sun gain\/turn: 25 (base) + 7 * 10 (Sunflowers) = 95.\n\nAvailable Actions & Priorities:\n- The I zombie in Row 2 is the highest priority due to its high damage (3) and insufficient current counter (1 damage\/turn).\n- Option 1: Plant Peashooter (W) at (2, 3). Cost 100. Sun left 10. Damage in row 2 becomes 2. As calculated before, this might not save the J and the W behind it.\n- Option 2: Plant Wall-nut (J) at (2, 3). Cost 50. Sun left 60. This stalls the I zombie for an extra position. The I zombie reaches J(2,3) in 2 turns. J(2,3) lasts 4 turns (10 HP \/ 3 DMG). Total 6 turns stalled at (2,3). During this time, W(2,1) deals 6 damage. Then I zombie moves to J(2,2). It reaches J(2,2) on turn 27+2+4 = Turn 33. J(2,2) lasts 4 turns. I zombie is killed after 7 damage from W(2,1) during stall + 4 damage during attack on J(2,2) = 11 damage. Still not enough. Hmm, my previous calculation was better. Let's re-evaluate Option 2 calculation:\n    - Turn 27: Plant J at (2, 3). Sun: 60. I at (2, 5) -> (2, 4). W(2,1) hits I (13 HP).\n    - Turn 28: I at (2, 4) -> (2, 3). Attacks J(2,3). W(2,1) hits I (12 HP). J(2,3) HP: 7. Sun: 60+95=155.\n    - Turn 29: I attacks J(2,3). W(2,1) hits I (11 HP). J(2,3) HP: 4. Sun: 155+95=250. Can plant W at (2, 4). Cost 100. Sun: 150. Damage becomes 2.\n    - Turn 30: I attacks J(2,3). W(2,1)+W(2,4) hit I (11-2=9 HP). J(2,3) HP: 1. Sun: 150+95=245.\n    - Turn 31: I attacks J(2,3). W(2,1)+W(2,4) hit I (9-2=7 HP). J(2,3) HP: -2 (destroyed). I moves to (2,2).\n    - Turn 32: I attacks J(2,2). W(2,1)+W(2,4) hit I (7-2=5 HP). J(2,2) HP: 7.\n    - Turn 33: I attacks J(2,2). W(2,1)+W(2,4) hit I (5-2=3 HP). J(2,2) HP: 4.\n    - Turn 34: I attacks J(2,2). W(2,1)+W(2,4) hit I (3-2=1 HP). J(2,2) HP: 1.\n    - Turn 35: I attacks J(2,2). W(2,1)+W(2,4) hit I (1-2=-1 HP) (I destroyed). J(2,2) destroyed.\nThis plan works, saving the Peashooter and Sunflower. It requires planting another Peashooter on Turn 29. Planting J at (2, 3) now enables this.\n\n- Option 3: Plant Sunflower (X) at (1, 4) or similar safe spot. Cost 50. Sun left 60. Improves economy but doesn't address the immediate threat in Row 2.\n\nConclusion: Planting a Wall-nut (J) at (2, 3) is the best move to stall the dangerous I zombie and allow time to build more defense in that row.\n\n```\nAnswer: J 2 3\n```","```markdown\nAnswer: J 0 0;W 2 0\n```","```\nAnswer: J 0 0;W 2 4\n```","```markdown\nAnswer: W 0 1","```\nAnswer: W 0 2;W 4 5\n```","Answer: J 0 0;X 1 4","Answer: J 3 0"],"prompt":"\nIn the following, you are required to participate in a simplified version of the Plants vs. Zombies game.

The Peashooter (W) at 0,0 will deal 1 damage, leaving it with 3 HP. Next turn, the zombie will move to 0,2. If undefended, it will eventually reach the Peashooter at 0,0.\n    *   **Row 1:** A Roadblock Zombie (R) with 8 HP is attacking the Wall-nut (J) at 1,2. The Peashooter (W) at 1,1 will deal 1 damage, leaving it with 7 HP. The Wall-nut has 10 HP and the zombie deals 1 damage, so the Wall-nut will take 1 damage, leaving it with 9 HP. The Wall-nut should hold for a while (9 turns against this zombie).\n    *   **Row 2:** A Normal Zombie (N) with 4 HP is at column 3. The Peashooter (W) at 2,2 will deal 1 damage, leaving it with 3 HP. Next turn, the zombie will move to 2,2 and attack the Peashooter. The Peashooter has 2 HP and the zombie deals 1 damage. The Peashooter will attack the zombie (3 HP -> 2 HP), zombie attacks Peashooter (2 HP -> 1 HP). Next turn (Turn 21), Peashooter attacks zombie (2 HP -> 1 HP), zombie attacks Peashooter (1 HP -> 0 HP). The Peashooter at 2,2 will die on Turn 21 without intervention.\n    *   **Row 3:** No threats.\n    *   **Row 4:** No threats.\n\n3.  **Turn 20 Events:**\n    *   Zombie spawning: Turn 20 is a multiple of 5, so zombies will spawn.\n    *   Difficulty increase: Turn 20 is a multiple of 10.

A Roadblock Zombie (R, 16 HP) is attacking the Peashooter (W) at (1,4). This Peashooter only has 1 HP left (2 HP - 1 damage from R) and will likely be destroyed next turn. The R will then move to (1,3).\n    *   **Line 2:** A Normal Zombie (N, 12 HP) is attacking the Wall-nut (J) at (2,3). This line seems relatively stable for now.\n    *   **Line 3:** A Roadblock Zombie (R, 16 HP) is at (3,4). It is currently unblocked and will move to (3,3) next turn, threatening the Sunflower (X) at (3,2). We urgently need a defender at (3,3).\n    *   **Line 4:** A Roadblock Zombie (R, 16 HP) is attacking the Wall-nut (J) at (4,2). Another Roadblock Zombie (R, 16 HP) is attacking the Peashooter (W) at (4,4). This Peashooter also only has 1 HP left and will likely be destroyed next turn. The R will then move to (4,3).

(Sun: 165 - 50 = 115)\n2.  **Plant Wall-nut (J) at (4,3):** This costs 50 sun and is essential to block the R zombie moving from (4,4). (Sun: 115 - 50 = 65)\n3.  **Plant Sunflower (X) at (0,2):** With the remaining 65 sun, we can plant another Sunflower. This costs 50 sun and increases future sun generation, which will be needed soon. Placing it at (0,2) behind the existing defense seems safe. (Sun: 65 - 50 = 15)\n\nThis plan addresses the most immediate threats by placing blockers and invests slightly in future sun production.\n\nAnswer: J 3 3;J 4 3;X 0 2","Answer: W 1 3","```text\nAnswer: J 1 1\n```","```plantuml\n@startuml\nskinparam monochrome true\nskinparam ranksep 20\nskinparam dpi 300\nhide empty members\n\nclass Game {\n  Turn: 31\n  Sun: 170\n  Score: 31\n  SunPerTurn: 25 + (10 * NumSunflowers)\n}\n\nclass Board {\n  Size: 5x7\n}\n\nabstract class Plant {\n  HP: int\n  Cost: int\n}\n\nclass Sunflower extends Plant {\n  Symbol: X\n  HP: 2\n  Cost: 50\n  SunBonus: 10\n}\n\nclass Peashooter extends Plant {\n  Symbol: W\n  HP: 2\n  Cost: 100\n  Damage: 1\n}\n\nclass ThreeLineShooter extends Plant {\n  Symbol: S\n  HP: 2\n  Cost: 325\n  Damage: 1 (3 rows)\n}\n\nclass WallNut extends Plant {\n  Symbol: J\n  HP: 10\n  Cost: 50\n}\n\nclass TorchStump extends Plant {\n  Symbol: H\n  HP: 2\n  Cost: 125\n  DamageBoost: +1 (to plant on left)\n}\n\nclass FireChili extends Plant {\n  Symbol: F\n  HP: N\/A (Instant)\n  Cost: 300\n  Effect: Clears Row\n}\n\nabstract class Zombie {\n  HP: int\n  Damage: int\n  Speed: 1 (left per turn)\n  HP_Bonus: int\n}\n\nclass RegularZombie extends Zombie {\n  Symbol: N\n  BaseHP: 4\n  Damage: 1\n}\n\nclass RoadblockZombie extends Zombie {\n  Symbol: R\n  BaseHP: 8\n  Damage: 1\n}\n\nclass BucketZombie extends Zombie {\n  Symbol: B\n  BaseHP: 12\n  Damage: 1\n}\n\nclass HighAttackZombie extends Zombie {\n  Symbol: I\n  BaseHP: 6\n  Damage: 3\n}\n\nGame *-- Board\nBoard o-- \"*\" Plant\nBoard o-- \"*\" Zombie\n\nnote \"Turn 31 State\" as N1\nN1 ..

Base gain is 25. We have 6 Sunflowers (X at 0,2; 1,0; 2,0; 2,1; 3,0; 3,2). Total sun gain per turn = 25 + 6 * 10 = 85.\n2.  **Zombie HP:** Turn 31 is after the turn 30 mark. HP Bonus = +12.\n    *   N: 4 + 12 = 16 HP\n    *   R: 8 + 12 = 20 HP\n    *   B: 12 + 12 = 24 HP\n    *   I: 6 + 12 = 18 HP\n3.  **Board State & Threats:**\n    *   The board representation `JN`, `JR`, `NI`, `IN` suggests zombies co-located or attacking. Assuming zombies are at the specified column or attacking the plant in that cell. Let's assume the rightmost column (6) holds the newly spawned zombies from Turn 30 and the `JN`\/`JR` indicates zombies that have already reached column 3 and are attacking the J (Wall-nuts).\n    *   Line 2: J(10HP) at (2,3) is attacked by N(16HP) at (2,3). W(2HP) at (2,2) attacks N. Incoming: N(16HP), I(18HP) at (2,6).\n    *   Line 3: J(10HP) at (3,3) is attacked by R(20HP) at (3,3). W(2HP) at (3,1) attacks R. Incoming: I(18HP), N(16HP) at (3,6).\n    *   Line 4: J(10HP) at (4,3) is attacked by R(20HP) at (4,3). W(2HP) at (4,0) attacks R.\n4.  **Defense Assessment:**\n    *   Row 2: J(10) vs N(16). W attacks (1 dmg\/turn). J lasts 10 turns. N lasts 16 turns. J falls first. N(6HP) moves on. Incoming zombies arrive at col 3 in 3 turns (end of T33).\n    *   Row 3: J(10) vs R(20). W attacks (1 dmg\/turn). J lasts 10 turns. R lasts 20 turns. J falls first. R(10HP) moves on. Incoming zombies arrive at col 3 in 3 turns (end of T33).\n    *   Row 4: J(10) vs R(20). W attacks (1 dmg\/turn). J lasts 10 turns. R lasts 20 turns. J falls first. R(10HP) moves on to J(10) at (4,2). Row 4 is better defended but slow.\n5.  **Immediate Problem:** Rows 2 and 3 Wall-nuts will fall before the current zombies are defeated. The arrival of zombie groups (especially High-Attack I) in 3 turns will overwhelm the Wall-nuts much faster.\n6.  **Strategy Options:**\n    *   **Boost Damage:** Plant Peashooters (W, 100 sun) or Torch Stump (H, 125 sun - requires careful placement\/replacement). Adding one W in row 2 or 3 helps defeat the first zombie faster but might not be enough when the group arrives.\n    *   **Add Defense:** Plant Wall-nuts (J, 50 sun). Replacing attackers\/sunflowers is generally bad. Limited empty space.\n    *   **Save for Big Guns:** Fire Chili (F, 300 sun) or Three-Line Shooter (S, 325 sun). Need more sun (130 for F, 155 for S). Requires waiting 2 turns (Turn 31 & 32).\n7.  **Chosen Strategy: Wait and Save for Fire Chili\/Three-Line Shooter:** Waiting allows accumulating enough sun for a high-impact plant by Turn 33. Fire Chili can clear a whole row threat, while Three-Line Shooter provides sustained multi-lane damage. Waiting seems necessary to handle the incoming groups effectively.\n8.  **Turn 31 Action while Waiting:** Instead of doing absolutely nothing, planting a Sunflower (X, 50 sun) is beneficial. It uses minimal sun, increases future sun generation, and doesn't compromise the plan to save for a bigger plant by T33. Plant X in a safe, empty spot like (0,3).\n\n**Action for Turn 31:** Plant a Sunflower in the top row, column 3.\n\nAnswer: X 0 3","```\nAnswer: H 3 1;J 1 3\n```","```\nAnswer: J 2 2;W 1 2;W 4 4;X 0 4\n```","```markdown\nAnswer: J 3 2;W 1 0\n```","```\nAnswer: J 2 1;J 3 2;W 2 0\n```","```\nAnswer: F 3 0;J 4 5\n```","Answer: F 2 1;W 1 2","```\nAnswer: F 3 0; J 2 0; J 1 0\n```","```markdown\nAnswer: F 2 0;W 1 0;J 3 0;J 1 1\n```"],"prompt":"\nIn the following, you are required to participate in a simplified version of the Plants vs. Zombies game.

J(2,2) and J(2,4) have 10 HP each and face 1 damage per turn, they will last 10 turns against the Normal Zombies. The R(12 HP) will reach J(2,4) in 1 turn.\n    *   **Line 3:** R(3,5) moving left (HP 8 + 4 = 12 HP). W(3,0) + H(3,1) deals 2 damage\/turn. The R will reach J(3,2) in 3 turns. Damage dealt before reaching J: 2*3 = 6. Remaining HP: 12 - 6 = 6. Once at J(3,2), it will take 6\/2 = 3 more turns to kill the R. J(3,2) has 10 HP and takes 1 damage\/turn, so it will survive (takes 3+3=6 turns total to kill R). This line seems okay for now.\n    *   **Line 4:** I(4,5) moving left (HP 6 + 4 = 10 HP). This is the highest priority threat due to its 3 damage\/turn. It will reach J(4,2) in 3 turns. J(4,2) has 10 HP and will be destroyed in ceil(10\/3) = 4 turns after the zombie reaches it. Urgent action needed.\n3.  **Sun Production:** 7 Sunflowers generate 70 sun\/turn + 25 base = 95 sun\/turn.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Neutralize Line 4 Threat:** The High-Attack Zombie (I) must be dealt with immediately. A Fire Chili (F) is the most effective way. It costs 300 sun and instantly removes the threat. Place F on Line 4.\n2.  **Bolster Line 2 Defense\/Offense:** With the R(2,5) approaching and two N zombies already engaged, adding damage is crucial. A Peashooter (W) behind the Wall-nuts can start dealing damage. Place W at (2,3). Costs 100 sun.\n3.  **Invest in Sun (Optional but Recommended):** With the immediate threats addressed, use remaining sun to improve economy. Place a Sunflower (X). Column 3 in Row 0 is available.

Cost: 50 sun.\n2.  **Add Damage in Row 2:** Plant a Peashooter (W) at (2, 3). This will target R first (at 2,1), adding 1 damage (total 2\/turn with S). R (8 HP) will die in 4 turns. Then W will target N (4 HP) at (2, 4). N will die in 4 turns.

It will survive this turn (1 HP left) but die next turn. Killing the R (20 HP) with current damage (2\/turn) takes 10 turns, which is too slow.\n4.  **Solution:** A Fire Chili (F, Cost 300) in Row 2 would eliminate both zombies (R at 2,1 and N at 2,4) and save the Sunflower.\n5.  **Affordability:** Current sun 240. Need 300. Next turn sun will be 345. Can afford it next turn.\n6.  **Action this turn:** To guarantee enough sun for the Fire Chili next turn, and potentially slightly increase sun generation, planting a Sunflower (X, Cost 50) is a good low-cost action. Planting it now means it will start generating sun next turn.\n    *   Sun after planting X: 240 - 50 = 190.\n    *   Sun gain at start of Turn 35: 25 (base) + 9 * 10 (9 Sunflowers) = 115.\n    *   Sun at start of Turn 35: 190 + 115 = 305.

My total sun will be 75 + 35 = 110.\n2.  **Board Events (Turn 5 -> Turn 6):**\n    *   The Peashooter (W) at (4,1) attacked the Regular Zombie (N) at (4,2).

The current Peashooter deals 1. A new Peashooter (100 sun) would deal another 1, totaling 2 damage, which is not enough. Fire Chili is too expensive (300 sun).\n    *   Therefore, the Peashooter at (4,1) will be lost. The best strategy is to improve the economy for future turns.\n    *   I have 110 sun. Planting another Sunflower (X) costs 50 sun. This leaves me with 60 sun.\n    *   Planting the Sunflower in column 0 is generally safe early on. Row 1 is empty.

We will gain 25 (base) + 5 * 10 (Sunflowers) = 75 Sun. Total Sun for Turn 11 actions = 160 + 75 = 235.\n2.  **Threats:**\n    *   **Line 0:** A Zombie (N, assumed 4 HP) is at (0, 2). The Peashooter (W) at (0, 1) will attack it (N HP -> 3). The Zombie will move to (0, 1) and attack the Peashooter. The Peashooter only has 2 HP, so it will likely fall in 2 turns if the zombie attacks first or 1 turn if the zombie moves then attacks. Let's assume the zombie moves then attacks: N moves to (0,1), attacks W(0,1). W HP -> 1.\n    *   **Line 2:** A Zombie (N, assumed 4 HP) is co-located with the Wall-nut (J) at (2, 1). The Wall-nut has 10 HP. The Zombie will attack the Wall-nut (J HP -> 9). The Zombie N will move to (2,0) and attack X(2,0). X HP -> 1.\n3.  **Turn 10 Spawning:** A new zombie spawned (rules state 1 zombie every 5 turns, +1 zombie count after turn 10, HP +4). So 1 zombie with +4 HP spawned. It could be N(8HP) or R(12HP). It could be on any line. We need defense on currently undefended lines eventually.\n4.  **Priorities:** Protect the Sunflowers, especially those under immediate threat (Line 2's X at (2,0)). Defend against incoming zombies. Set up offense on undefended lines.\n\n**Simulated Actions (End of Turn 10 -> Start of Turn 11):**\n\n*   Sun: 160 -> 160 + 25 + 50 = 235\n*   W(0,1) shoots N(0,2).

X HP = 1.\n*   1 Zombie spawns (e.g., N(8HP) at (3,6)).\n\n**Battlefield Start of Turn 11:**\n\nTurn: 11 | Sun: 235 | Score: 11\nLine0|X  |WN |0  |0  |0  |0  |0     (X:2HP, W:1HP, N:3HP)\nLine1|X  |0  |0  |0  |0  |0  |0     (X:2HP)\nLine2|XN |J  |0  |0  |0  |0  |0     (X:1HP, N:4HP, J:10HP)\nLine3|X  |0  |0  |0  |0  |0  |N(8)  (X:2HP, N:8HP at 3,6)\nLine4|X  |0  |0  |0  |0  |0  |0     (X:2HP)\n\n**Strategy for Turn 11:**\n\n*   Line 0: W(0,1) will die next turn. N(3HP) will then attack X(0,0). We need defense there. A Wall-nut (J) at (0,2) would block the N after it kills W. Cost: 50.\n*   Line 2: X(2,0) will die next turn. N(4HP) will then attack J(2,1). We need a Peashooter (W) to start damaging N. Placing W at (2,2) makes sense. Cost: 100.\n*   Line 3: An 8HP Zombie is coming. We need a Peashooter, maybe W at (3,1). Cost: 100.\n\nTotal Cost Options:\n1.  J(0,2) + W(2,2) = 50 + 100 = 150 Sun. (Leaves 85 Sun) - Addresses immediate threats.\n2.  W(2,2) + W(3,1) = 100 + 100 = 200 Sun.

It sacrifices the W(0,1) and X(2,0) which are doomed anyway, but sets up defenses with J(0,2) and W(2,2).\n\n**Decision:** Plant J at (0, 2) and W at (2, 2).\n\nAnswer: J 0 2;W 2 2","Answer:","```\nTurn:12 | Sun:160 | Score: 12\n\nCurrent Battlefield (X: Sunflower, W: Peashooter, S: Three-Line Shooter, J: Wall-nut, H: Torch Stump, F: Fire Chili, N: Zombie, R: Roadblock Zombie,B: Bucket Zombie,I: High-Attack Zombie)\nLine0|X  |W  |J  |0  |0  |0  |0\nLine1|X  |0  |0  |0  |0  |R  |0   (R HP: 8, Pos: 1,5)\nLine2|X  |JN |W  |0  |0  |0  |0   (N HP: 4, Pos: 2,1 attacking J HP: 10; W at 2,2 will attack N)\nLine3|X  |0  |0  |0  |0  |N  |0   (N HP: 4, Pos: 3,5)\nLine4|X  |0  |0  |0  |0  |0  |0\n\nSun Generation: 25 (base) + 5 * 10 (Sunflowers) = 75 sun per turn.\n\nAnalysis:\n- Row 0: Defended by W(0,1) and J(0,2).

W(1,3) HP: 2 -> -1. **W(1,3) is destroyed.**\n    - I(4,5) attacks W(4,4). W(4,4) HP: 2 -> -1. **W(4,4) is destroyed.**\n    - B(0,5) attacks nothing.\n4.  **Zombie Movement:**\n    - B(0,5) -> B(0,4).\n    - I(1,5) -> I(1,4). (Now has 8 HP).\n    - I(4,5) -> I(4,4). (Now has 10 HP).\n\n**Threat Assessment:**\n-   **Line 1:** W(1,3) dies. I(1,4) (8 HP) will attack W(1,2) next turn. W(1,2) will die quickly (1 turn). Then I(1,4) -> I(1,3) attacks J(1,1). High priority.\n-   **Line 4:** W(4,4) dies. I(4,4) (10 HP) will attack J(4,3) next turn. J(4,3) (9 HP) is already attacked by R(4,3) (10 HP). J(4,3) will take 1(R) + 3(I) = 4 damage per turn starting next turn. J(4,3) will die end of Turn 24. Then R and I will quickly destroy W(4,2), X(4,1), X(4,0). High priority.\n-   **Line 0:** R(0,3) attacks J(0,3). B(0,4) advances. W(0,1) attacks R(0,3). Seems less critical than lines 1 and 4 for now.\n\n**Strategy - Turn 22 (Sun: 240):**\n-   **Line 1:** Need to stall I(1,4). Planting J(1,4) costs 50 sun. It has 10 HP and will take 3 damage\/turn from I(1,4). It will last 4 turns (23, 24, 25, 26). During this time, W(1,2) will shoot I(1,4), reducing its HP from 8 to 4. This is a good delaying tactic. (Cost: 50 Sun. Remaining: 190 Sun).\n-   **Line 4:** Row 4 defense is crumbling. J(4,3) will fall end of T24 even with W(4,2) hitting R(4,3). Adding W(4,6) (Cost 100) would increase damage on R, but not save J(4,3). Planting J(4,4) isn't possible (W is there, and will die). Planting J(4,6) (Cost 50) doesn't help immediately. The best immediate action seems difficult. Perhaps focus resources elsewhere.\n-   **Line 0:** B(0,4) will start attacking next turn if we don't place something in (0,4). W(0,1) damages R(0,3). Placing W(0,4) (Cost 100 Sun) would add damage to R(0,3) now, and block\/damage B(0,4) next turn. B deals 1 damage, W has 2 HP, so W(0,4) would last 2 turns against B. (Cost: 100 Sun. Remaining: 90 Sun).\n-   **Economy:** Plant a Sunflower (X) in a safe spot like (2,3) or (3,3). (Cost: 50 Sun. Remaining: 40 Sun).\n\n**Proposed Plan:**\n1.  Plant J at (1,4) to stall the High-Attack Zombie. (Cost 50, Sun 190)\n2.  Plant W at (0,4) to increase damage in Row 0 and prepare for the Bucket Zombie. (Cost 100, Sun 90)\n3.  Plant X at (2,3) to improve sun generation. (Cost 50, Sun 40)\n\nTotal cost: 50 + 100 + 50 = 200 Sun.

It will die in 10 turns (End of Turn 49). B has 28 HP. W(2,4) deals 1 damage.\n6.  **Sun:** Current 145. Income: 25 (base) + 4*10 (Sunflowers) = 65\/turn.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe most immediate threat is W(3,2) dying next turn, leaving N(3,2) uncountered initially. Placing a Torch Stump (H) at (3,3) will boost W(3,2)'s damage to 2. This costs 125 sun.\n\n*   **Turn 40:** Place H(3,3). Sun: 145 - 125 = 20. W(3,2) attacks N(3,2) for 2 damage (N HP=18). N(3,2) attacks W(3,2) for 1 damage (W HP=1).\n*   **Turn 41:** Sun: 20 + 65 = 85. W(3,2) attacks N(3,2) for 2 damage (N HP=16). N(3,2) attacks W(3,2) for 1 damage (W HP=0, dies). N(3,2) starts attacking J(3,1).\n*   **Turn 42:** Sun: 85 + 65 = 150. Place W(3,2) (Cost 100, Sun left 50). This new W(3,2) is boosted by H(3,3) and deals 2 damage per turn. It will take 8 more turns to kill N(16 HP), during which J(3,1) will take 8 damage (survives).\n\nThis plan addresses the critical threat in Line 3, although Lines 1 and 4 remain vulnerable and will need attention soon. Placing H(3,3) is the best first step.\n\n**Answer:** H 3 3","```\nTurn: 41 | Sun: 85 | Score: 41\n\nInitial Sun: 85\nSun Generated: 25 (base) + 4 * 10 (Sunflowers) = 65\nTotal Sun Available: 85 + 65 = 150\n\nBattlefield Analysis:\nLine 0: W(0,1) will be destroyed by B(0,2) and R(0,2).

Zombie N HP: 4 -> 3.\n3.  **Zombie Actions:** Zombie N at (4,4) attacks Wall-nut J at (4,4). Wall-nut J HP: 10 -> 9.\n4.  **Zombie Movement:** Zombie N at (4,4) is blocked by J at (4,4).\n5.  **Zombie Spawning (End of Turn 9 -> Start of Turn 10):** Turn 10 is a multiple of 5 and 10. Spawn count increases by 1 (now 2 zombies per spawn wave). HP increases by 4 for newly spawned zombies. Two Regular Zombies (N) spawn (Roadblocks only appear after Turn 10) with 4 + 4 = 8 HP each.

Another Bucket Zombie (B) is at (1,5). The two Peashooters (W) at (1,1) and (1,2) are attacking B(1,3).\n    - **Line 2:** A Roadblock Zombie (R) at (2,3) is attacking the Wall-nut (J) at (2,3). There are no offensive plants in this row.\n    - **Line 3:** A Roadblock Zombie (R) at (3,3) is attacking the Wall-nut (J) at (3,3). Another Roadblock Zombie (R) is at (3,5) and advancing. There are no offensive plants in this row.\n    - **Line 0 & 4:** Currently safe. Line 4 has a boosted Peashooter.\n- **Economy:** 8 Sunflowers generate 80 sun + 25 base = 105 sun per turn.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  **Line 3 Threat:** R(3,5) will reach J(3,3) in 2 turns. This needs addressing.\n2.  **Line 2 Threat:** R(2,3) needs an attacker.\n3.  **Line 1 Threat:** B(1,5) will eventually reach the defense. B(1,3) is being slowly chipped down.\n\n**Options:**\n1.  **Fire Chili (F) on Line 3:** Cost 300. Place F(3,4). This instantly clears both R(3,3) and R(3,5). Leaves 60 sun. Solves the most immediate advancing threat.\n2.  **Three-Line Shooter (S) at (2,0):** Cost 325. Replaces X(2,0). Attacks rows 1, 2, and 3. Hits B(1,3), R(2,3), and R(3,3). Good multi-lane coverage but doesn't stop R(3,5) immediately and removes a sunflower. Leaves 35 sun.\n3.  **Peashooters (W):** Can place W(2,?) and W(3,?) to deal with zombies, but would require replacing sunflowers or placing them further back, and might not be enough damage quickly. Cost 100 each.\n\n**Decision:**\nUsing the Fire Chili (F) on Line 3 is the most direct way to eliminate the immediate threat of the advancing R(3,5) and the blocked R(3,3). This frees up Line 3 completely for now. While the Three-Line Shooter offers sustained damage, the instant removal on the most threatened lane is safer.\n\n**Action:** Plant Fire Chili (F) at Row 3, Column 4.\n\nAnswer: F 3 4","```plantuml\n@startuml\n!define BordRows 5\n!define BordCols 7\n!define Turn 28\n!define Sun 165\n!define Score 28\n!define PLANTTYPES {X:\"Sunflower (2HP, 50S, +10S\/T)\", W:\"Peashooter (2HP, 100S, 1D)\", S:\"Three-Line Shooter (2HP, 325S, 1D 3L)\", J:\"Wall-nut (10HP, 50S)\", H:\"Torch Stump (2HP, 125S, +1D Left)\", F:\"Fire Chili (300S, Row Kill)\"}\n!define ZOMBIETYPES {N:\"Regular Zombie (4HP, 1D)\", R:\"Roadblock Zombie (8HP, 1D)\", B:\"Bucket Zombie (12HP, 1D)\", I:\"High-Attack Zombie (6HP, 3D)\"}\n!define CURRENT ZOMBIEBUFF {HP: \"+8\", Count: \"+2\"}\n\ntitle Turn: Turn | Sun: Sun | Score: Score\n\nboard BORD[BordRows][BordCols] {\n    [W(2)], [X(2)], [X(2)], [0], [0], [0], [0];\n    [X(2)], [W(2)], [W(2)], [J(10)], [B(12)], [0], [0];\n    [X(2)], [X(2)], [X(2)], [J(10)], [R(8)], [0], [0];\n    [J(10)], [X(2)], [X(2)], [J(10)], [0], [0], [0];\n    [W(2)], [H(2)], [J(10)], [0], [0], [0], [0];\n}\n\nnote \"Zombie Notes:\\nN: 4+8=12 HP\\nR: 8+8=16 HP\\nB: 12+8=20 HP\\nI: 6+8=14 HP\\nNext spawn: Turn 30 (4 Zombies, +12 HP total)\"\nnote \"Plant Costs:\\nX:50, W:100, S:325, J:50, H:125, F:300\"\nnote \"Sun Income:\\nBase: 25\\nSunflowers (9): 9 * 10 = 90\\nTotal: 25 + 90 = 115\"\n\n' Turn 28 Logic:\n' Line 0: W(0,0), X(0,1), X(0,2).

Sun: 375. Sunflowers: X(0,1), X(0,2), X(1,0), X(2,0), X(2,1), X(2,2), X(3,1), X(3,2) = 8 sunflowers. Sun gain per turn = 25 + 8*10 = 105.\n2.  Threats:\n    *   Row 1: Two Bucket Zombies (B, 12 base HP + 8 bonus = 20 HP each) are at (1,3), attacking the Wall-nut J(1,3) (10 HP). The J takes 2 damage per turn and will fall in 5 turns (end of T35). The Peashooters W(1,1) and W(1,2) deal 2 damage per turn to the first B zombie. If J falls, the zombies will quickly overwhelm W(1,2), W(1,1), and X(1,0). This lane will likely fall around T39.\n    *   Row 2: A Roadblock Zombie (R, 8 base HP + 8 bonus = 16 HP) is in the same cell as the Sunflower X(2,2). Assuming the zombie attacks the plant in its cell, R deals 1 damage per turn to X(2,2) (2 HP). X(2,2) will die at the end of T31. R will then move left, destroying X(2,1) (T33), X(2,0) (T35), and reach the house at T36.\n3.  Priority: Row 2 is the more immediate threat, collapsing by T36. Row 1 collapses later, around T39.\n4.  Strategy:\n    *   Address Row 2 immediately: Planting a Wall-nut J(2,2) (Cost 50, 10 HP) can replace the Sunflower X(2,2). The R zombie will attack J(2,2) starting T31, and the J will last 10 turns (until T40). This buys significant time.\n    *   Address Row 1 immediately: The two B zombies (20 HP each) pose a significant threat that the current peashooters cannot handle long-term, especially after J(1,3) falls. Using a Fire Chili F(1,0) (Cost 300) will instantly eliminate both zombies in Row 1, securing the lane. This replaces the Sunflower X(1,0).\n    *   Combined Action: Plant J(2,2) and F(1,0).\n    *   Cost: 50 + 300 = 350 sun. Remaining Sun: 375 - 350 = 25.\n    *   Plants Replaced: X(1,0) and X(2,2). 6 Sunflowers remain.\n    *   Outcome: Row 1 is cleared. Row 2 is temporarily secured by J(2,2), which will hold R(16HP) for 10 turns. This requires planting a damage dealer (like a Peashooter) in Row 2 in subsequent turns to eliminate R before J(2,2) falls. With 25 sun left and 85 sun income next turn (25 + 6*10), we can plant W(2,1) (cost 100) on turn 32. This plan secures both threatened lanes.\n\nAction: Plant Wall-nut (J) at row 2, column 2. Plant Fire Chili (F) at row 1, column 0.\n\nAnswer: J 2 2;F 1 0\n```","Okay, let's analyze the board and make a move.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Line 0:** A Peashooter (W) is attacking a Roadblock Zombie (R, 20 HP). The R is far away. Defense seems okay for now but could use bolstering.\n2.  **Line 1:** Two Peashooters (W) are attacking a Bucket Zombie (B, 24 HP) which is attacking a Wall-nut (J, 10 HP). The J has 9 HP left. The B is taking 2 damage per turn and has 22 HP left. It will take 11 turns to defeat the B, while the J will fall in 9 turns. This line needs attention soon, but the J is holding for now.\n3.  **Line 2:** A Roadblock Zombie (R, 20 HP) is attacking a Sunflower (X, 2 HP) at (2,2). The Sunflower only has 1 HP left and will be destroyed next turn if nothing is done. This is the most critical threat.\n4.  **Line 3:** Defenses (J, J) are holding, no immediate threats. Sunflowers are generating sun.\n5.  **Line 4:** A Peashooter (W) boosted by a Torch Stump (H) is dealing 2 damage per turn to the first zombie in the row (R, 20 HP or I, 18 HP). Both zombies are far away. Defense seems okay for now, but the High-Attack Zombie (I) could be dangerous later.\n\n**Sun:** 480 available. Next turn: 480 + 25 (base) + 7*10 (Sunflowers) = 575.\n\n**Priorities:**\n1.  Save the Sunflower at (2,2).\n2.  Increase damage output on critical lanes (Line 1, Line 2, Line 4).\n\n**Options:**\n*   **Fire Chili (F) on Line 2:** Costs 300. Instantly removes the R at (2,2) and saves the Sunflower X(2,2). Leaves 180 Sun.\n*   **Three-Line Shooter (S) at (1,0):** Costs 325. Replaces X(1,0). Hits R(0,6), B(1,3), and R(2,2). Deals 1 damage to R(2,2) before it attacks, saving X(2,2). Leaves 155 Sun. Also helps Line 0 and Line 1. Loses 10 sun\/turn from the replaced Sunflower.\n*   **Three-Line Shooter (S) at (2,0):** Costs 325. Replaces X(2,0). Hits B(1,3), R(2,2), and nothing on Line 3. Deals 1 damage to R(2,2), saving X(2,2). Leaves 155 Sun. Also helps Line 1. Loses 10 sun\/turn.\n*   **Plant Peashooter (W) or Wall-nut (J) in front of X(2,2):** Cannot place W\/J at (2,3) as the R is at (2,2).\n\n**Decision:**\nPlanting a Three-Line Shooter (S) offers both immediate relief for Line 2 and long-term damage increase across multiple lanes. Placing S at (1,0) seems most beneficial as it hits threats in lanes 0, 1, and 2. Saving X(2,2) is crucial. Replacing X(1,0) is an acceptable cost.\n\n1.  **Plant S at (1,0):** Cost 325. Sun: 480 -> 155. This saves X(2,2) and adds damage to Lines 0 and 1.\n2.  With the remaining 155 sun, we can add more firepower. Line 4 has R+I incoming. Adding a Peashooter there would be useful.\n3.  **Plant W at (4,3):** Cost 100. Sun: 155 -> 55.

This line is critical because W(1,1) dying will expose X(1,0) to R(1,2) and I(1,2).\n4.  **Line 2:** W(2,2) attacks N(2,4) (HP 4+12=16). N(2,4), B(2,4) (HP 24), B(2,4) (HP 24) attack J(2,3) (HP 10).

This costs 50 sun. It will absorb damage (4\/turn) for 2 turns.\n*   **Add Offense:** Plant W(Peashooter, 100 sun) in rows 0, 1, or 2. e.g., W 0 5, W 1 5, W 2 5.\n*   **Fire Chili (F):** Costs 300 sun. Not affordable this turn (190 + 105 next turn = 295 sun). But affordable next turn if we save sun. Using F on Line 1 would clear all zombies there.\n*   **Save for Fire Chili:** The best long-term solution for Line 1 seems to be Fire Chili next turn. To afford it (300 sun needed, 295 available next turn), we need 5 more sun or slightly more income. Planting a Sunflower (X, 50 sun) now is a good option. It costs 50 sun, leaving 140. Next turn: 140 + 25 + 9*10 (new sunflower included) = 140 + 115 = 255 sun. Still not enough for Fire Chili. Let's recheck sun calculation. Starting sun 190. Next turn gain = 25 + 8*10 = 105. Total available = 295. Need 300.\n\nLet's re-evaluate saving. If we do nothing: Sun = 190. Next turn = 190 + 25 + 8*10 = 295. Still 5 short.\nMaybe the base sun is slightly higher or one zombie kill provides sun? Assuming rules are strict, F is not possible next turn.\n\nLet's reconsider the initial plan: J 1 1; W 0 5; W 2 5. Cost 250. Sun left 40. This shores up defenses\/offense in three lanes simultaneously. Although Line 1 is still weak long-term, this addresses immediate threats broadly. J at (1,1) replaces the dying W(1,1), protecting X(1,0) for 2 turns. W at (0,5) doubles damage in row 0. W at (2,5) doubles damage in row 2.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe most balanced approach to handle the immediate threats across multiple lanes, given the sun constraint preventing Fire Chili next turn, is to plant J 1 1, W 0 5, and W 2 5.\n\n```\nAnswer: J 1 1; W 0 5; W 2 5\n```","```markdown\n","Answer: J 0 3;W 2 4;W 3 5","```\nTurn:46 | Sun:135 | Score: 46\n\nCurrent Battlefield (X: Sunflower, W: Peashooter, S: Three-Line Shooter, J: Wall-nut, H: Torch Stump, F: Fire Chili, N: Zombie, R: Roadblock Zombie,B: Bucket Zombie,I: High-Attack Zombie)\nLine0|W  |X  |I  |J  |J  |W  |N\nLine1|0  |WRIR|I  |0  |0  |0  |0\nLine2|X  |X  |W  |JBBN|W  |0  |RB\nLine3|J  |X  |X  |J  X  |W  |NN\nLine4|W  |H  |J  |W  |0  |X  |0\n\nAnalysis:\n- Line 0: The I zombie at (0,2) will destroy the Sunflower X at (0,1) this turn and then attack the Peashooter W at (0,0) next turn.

Planting `J` at (2,1) or (2,2) tries to save one sunflower but likely fails quickly. Let's place `J` at (2,0) to create a strong point. Cost: 50 Sun. Remaining: 125 Sun.\n- **Priority 2: Line 1.** The `J` at (1,0) will fall next turn. Add firepower. Plant a Peashooter (`W`) at (1,1). It will add 1 damage to the zombie group at (1,0) and block them when they destroy J(1,0) and advance. Cost: 100 Sun. Remaining: 25 Sun.\n\n**Action:** Plant a Wall-nut in row 2, column 0 and a Peashooter in row 1, column 1.\n\n```\nAnswer: J 2 0; W 1 1\n```","```\nAnswer: J 2 2;J 0 0\n```"],"prompt":"\nIn the following, you are required to participate in a simplified version of the Plants vs. Zombies game. The game is played on a 5×7 board, where zombies spawn from the far right side and move one step to the left each turn. The types of plants and zombies are as follows:\n\nPlants  \n- Sunflower (X): Costs 50 sun, has 2 HP, and generates an extra 10 sun each turn.  \n- Peashooter (W): Costs 100 sun, has 2 HP, and deals 1 damage each turn to the first zombie in its current row.  \n- Three-Line Shooter (S): Costs 325 sun, has 2 HP, and deals 1 damage each turn to the first zombie in its current row as well as the first zombie in each of the adjacent rows.  \n- Wall-nut (J): Costs 50 sun and has 10 HP.  \n- Torch Stump (H): Costs 125 sun, has 2 HP; it increases the damage of the plant to its left in the same row (applied directly to the plant rather than to a projectile) by +1, and this effect can only be applied once.  \n- Fire Chili (F): Costs 300 sun and eliminates all zombies in its row.\n\nZombies  \n- Regular Zombie (N): Has 4 HP and deals 1 damage each turn to the plant that blocks its path.  \n- Roadblock Zombie (R): Has 8 HP and deals 1 damage each turn to the plant that blocks its path.  \n- Bucket Zombie (B): Has 12 HP and deals 1 damage each turn to the plant that blocks its path.  \n- High-Attack Zombie (I): Has 6 HP and deals 3 damage each turn to the plant that blocks its path.\n\nRules  \n- At least 25 sun is gained each turn.\n- A new zombie is spawned every 5 turns.\n- After every 10 turns, newly spawned zombies have their HP increased by 4, and the number of zombies spawned increases by 1.\n- Your score increases by 1 each turn.\n- The game lasts for a maximum of 100 turns.\n- Plants cannot be placed on the same grid cell, but zombies can coexist in the same cell.\n- There are no lawn mowers.\n- Roadblock Zombies only spawn after turn 10, and Bucket Zombies and High-Attack Zombies only spawn after turn 20.\n\nPlease input in the format \"PlantType Row Column\".

This increases sun production to 45\/turn. Remaining sun: 55. This seems like the best long-term investment.\n    *   Option 2: Plant a Wall-nut (J) in row 0 for 50 sun. Remaining sun: 55.

This immediately starts dealing with the zombie.\n\n**Decision:**\nSun production is crucial early on. Planting another Sunflower is the priority.

The Wall-nut has high HP (10), so it should hold for a while.\n    *   Row 2: Zombie (N) is at column 4, moving towards the Peashooter (W) at column 1. The Peashooter will shoot it.

Damage per turn on J 2 2 is 3+1=4. J 2 2 has 10HP and will fall quickly. N 2 6 (16HP) is also approaching. S 1 2 and S 3 3 will hit the N 2 2 at col 2.\n5.  **Line 3:** S 3 3 attacks row 2, 3, 4. It will target N 2 2 and R 3 6 (20HP). R 3 6 and I 3 6 (18HP) will move to 3 5. This line needs defense soon.\n6.  **Line 4:** Secure.\n\n**Threat Prioritization:** Line 2 is the most immediate threat. The Wall-nut J 2 2 will be overwhelmed quickly by the combined attack of I 2 2 and N 2 2. Once it falls, the zombies will target J 2 1, and then the plants behind. The incoming N 2 6 adds to the pressure.\n\n**Strategy:** Using a Fire Chili (F) in Line 2 is the most effective way to instantly eliminate all zombies in that row (N 2 2, I 2 2, N 2 2, N 2 6), saving the Wall-nuts and clearing the immediate danger.\n\n**Action:**\n- Plant Fire Chili (F) in Row 2.

J@4,2 is safe for now (lasts 10\/(1+1)=5 turns once zombies reach it), but no offense.\n7.  **Priority:** Row 1 needs urgent attention before J@1,3 falls in 4 turns.\n8.  **Solution:** Fire Chili (F, cost 300) can clear the entire row.\n9.  **Affordability:** Current Sun = 210. Sun T43 start = 210+75=285. Sun T44 start = 285+75=360. Can afford Fire Chili at the start of Turn 44.\n10. **Action:** Waiting two turns for Fire Chili is the best way to save Row 1.

The Wall-nut takes 2 damage per turn (1 from N, 1 from B) and will fall in 5 turns. The Peashooter (W) at (0,1) deals 1 damage per turn.\n2.  **Increase Damage on Line 0:** The combined 16 HP (N+B) will take 16 turns to defeat with the current Peashooter. Adding another Peashooter at (0, 0) will double the damage output to 2 per turn. This costs 100 sun. With 2 damage\/turn, the N (4HP) dies in 2 turns, and the B (12HP) dies in another 6 turns (total 8 turns). The Wall-nut takes 2 damage for 2 turns (4 damage) and 1 damage for 6 turns (6 damage), surviving exactly 10 damage. This addresses the immediate threat effectively.\n3.  **Boost Economy:** With the remaining 110 sun (210 - 100), planting another Sunflower (X) for 50 sun is beneficial for future turns, especially with zombie HP and numbers increasing. Placing it at (2, 0) seems safe.\n4.  **Final Sun:** 210 - 100 (W 0 0) - 50 (X 2 0) = 60 sun remaining.\n5.  **Next Turn Preparation:** Next turn is turn 25, a zombie spawn turn. 3 zombies with Base HP + 8 will spawn. Having addressed the immediate threat and boosted sun allows for better preparation.\n\nAnswer: W 0 0;X 2 0\n```","Answer: W 0 0;H 4 1","Answer: F 4 5;J 2 4","```markdown\nAnswer: W 3 4","Answer: X 4 5","```\nTurn:29 | Sun:145 | Score: 29\n\nCurrent Battlefield (X: Sunflower, W: Peashooter, S: Three-Line Shooter, J: Wall-nut, H: Torch Stump, F: Fire Chili, N: Zombie, R: Roadblock Zombie,B: Bucket Zombie,I: High-Attack Zombie)\nLine0|X  |W  |J  |JNB|0  |0  |0\nLine1|X  |W  |J  |N  |JN |0  |0\nLine2|X  |W  |J  |W  |JB |0  |0\nLine3|X  |W  |J  |J  |WB |0  |0\nLine4|X  |X  |J  |W  |J  |X  |0\n\nZombies:\n- Line 0: N and B at (0,3).

W(4,3) attacks nothing.\n\nSun: 145.\nSun generation: 7 Sunflowers * 10 Sun\/turn + 25 base = 95 Sun\/turn.\n\nThreat Analysis:\n1.  Row 3: W(3,4) has 2 HP and is attacked by B(3,4) (1 dmg\/turn). W(3,4) will survive for 2 more turns (until end of turn 31). After that, B(3,4) will attack J(3,3). J(3,3) has 10 HP and will survive 10 turns (until end of turn 41). The B(3,4) has high HP (likely 12 base + 8 bonus = 20 HP). Currently attacked by W(3,1)+W(3,4) for 2 dmg\/turn. After W(3,4) falls, only by W(3,1) for 1 dmg\/turn. It will take a long time to kill.\n2.  Row 0: J(0,3) has 10 HP and is attacked by N(0,3) (1 dmg\/turn) and B(0,3) (1 dmg\/turn). Total 2 dmg\/turn. J(0,3) will survive 5 turns (until end of turn 34). After that, N and B will attack J(0,2). J(0,2) has 10 HP and will survive 5 turns (until end of turn 39). W(0,1) attacks the first zombie (N, then B). With 1 dmg\/turn, it will take a long time to clear N and B. This row is under significant pressure.\n3.  Row 2: J(2,4) has 10 HP and is attacked by B(2,4) (1 dmg\/turn). Survives 10 turns (until end of turn 39). B(2,4) is attacked by W(2,1)+W(2,3) for 2 dmg\/turn. If B HP is 20, it takes 10 turns to kill (dies end of turn 39). This row holds exactly.\n4.  Row 1: J(1,2) attacked by N(1,3). J(1,4) attacked by N(1,4). Both have 10 HP, should hold for a while against regular zombies. W(1,1) attacks N(1,3). Seems stable for now.\n\nPriority: Row 0 needs help due to two zombies attacking and limited damage output. Row 3 also needs help eventually, but holds for longer.\n\nOptions:\n1.  Plant W(0,4): Costs 100 sun. Remaining sun 45. Doubles the damage in row 0 to 2\/turn. This will kill N faster and help defeat B before J(0,2) falls. Seems effective for the most pressured lane.\n2.  Plant W(3,5): Costs 100 sun. Remaining sun 45. Increases damage in row 3 after W(3,4) falls. This helps kill B(3,4) faster after turn 31.\n3.  Plant J(0,4) or J(3,5): Costs 50 sun. Adds defense but doesn't solve the damage problem, especially in row 0. J(3,4) would replace W(3,4), reducing damage further.\n4.  Plant H(x,y): Costs 125 sun. Can boost damage significantly, but needs to be placed to the right of a Peashooter\/Threeline. Current spots (like 0,2, 1,2, 2,2, 3,2) are occupied by Wall-nuts. Replacing a Wall-nut with H is risky as H has low HP.\n5.  Save Sun: Have 145+95=240 next turn. Allows for more expensive plants later, but Row 0 might collapse.\n\nDecision: Planting W(0,4) addresses the most immediate threat on Row 0 by significantly increasing damage output. Row 3, while precarious, should hold until next turn when reinforcements can potentially be added with the regenerated sun.\n\n```\nAnswer: W 0 4\n```","Answer: J 2 4;X 1 3","Answer: J 0 2;W 3 4","```\nTurn:32 | Sun:200 | Score: 32\n\nCurrent Battlefield (X: Sunflower, W: Peashooter, S: Three-Line Shooter, J: Wall-nut, H: Torch Stump, F: Fire Chili, N: Zombie, R: Roadblock Zombie,B: Bucket Zombie,I: High-Attack Zombie)\nLine0|X  |W  |J  |JB |W  |0  |0\nLine1|X  |W  |J  |X  |JN |I  |0\nLine2|X  |W  |J  |W  |JB |0  |0\nLine3|X  |W  |J  |JB |W  |NIR|0\nLine4|X  |X  |J  |W  |J  |X  |0\n\nZombie HP Calculation (Base + 8 HP due to turn > 30):\nN: 4 + 8 = 12 HP\nR: 8 + 8 = 16 HP\nB: 12 + 8 = 20 HP\nI: 6 + 8 = 14 HP\n\nAnalysis:\n- Line 1: Wall-nut (J at 1,2, 10HP) is attacked by Normal Zombie (N at 1,4, 12HP, 1 dmg\/turn).

Reinforcing this lane defensively is critical.\n- Line 3: Wall-nut (J at 3,2, 10HP) is attacked by Bucket Zombie (B at 3,3, 20HP, 1 dmg\/turn). Behind B are N (12HP), I (14HP), and R (16HP). Peashooters (W at 3,1 and W at 3,4) are attacking the first zombie in the row (N). N takes 2 dmg\/turn and will die in 6 turns. The Wall-nut will fall in 10 turns to the Bucket Zombie.

Sun remaining: 160 - 50 = 110.\n2.  Place a Peashooter (W) at (3,4). Cost 100 sun. This adds 1 damage to the R zombie on Line 3. Total damage = W(3,1)+W(3,4) = 1+1 = 2\/turn. The R zombie (20HP) will now die in 10 turns (Turn 48). The J(3,3) also lasts 10 turns (until Turn 48). This secures Line 3 for now.

This is not enough to kill the zombies (23, 24 HP) before J(0,2) falls.\n\nRow 1: X(1,0), W(1,1), J(1,2), X(1,3), X(1,4). No zombies. Safe for now.\n\nRow 2: X(2,0), W(2,1), J(2,2), W(2,3). No zombies. Safe for now.\n\nRow 3: X(3,0), W(3,1), J(3,2). Zombies R (24 HP), I (22 HP) are at (3,3). There is no plant at (3,3).\n- W(3,1) will attack the first zombie (let's assume R). R HP -> 23.\n- The R and I zombies at (3,3) will advance to (3,2) next turn (Turn 46) and attack J(3,2) (10 HP). J(3,2) will take 1(R) + 3(I) = 4 damage per turn. It will last 10\/4 = 2.5 -> 3 turns. W(3,1) deals 1 damage per turn. This is definitely not enough to kill the zombies (23, 22 HP) before J(3,2) falls. Row 3 is in critical danger.\n\nRow 4: X(4,0), X(4,1), J(4,2), W(4,3), J(4,4), X(4,5). No zombies. Safe for now.\n\nSun generation check: 6 Sunflowers (X) visible + 3 hidden (1,3; 1,4; 4,5) ? Let's count them: X(0,0), X(1,0), X(1,3), X(1,4), X(2,0), X(3,0), X(4,0), X(4,1), X(4,5). Total 9 Sunflowers. 9 * 10 = 90 sun\/turn. Base sun = 25. Total = 115 sun\/turn. Sun at start of next turn = 235 + 115 = 350.\n\nPriorities:\n1.  Reinforce Row 3 defense\/offense. J(3,2) will fall in 3 turns.\n2.  Reinforce Row 0 defense\/offense. J(0,2) will fall in 5 turns (after W(0,3) dies this turn).\n3.  Prepare for 5 new zombies spawning this turn.\n\nAvailable Sun: 235.\n\nOptions:\n- Fire Chili (F) on Row 3: Costs 300. Not affordable.\n- Three-Line Shooter (S): Costs 325. Not affordable.\n- Add Peashooters (W): Cost 100 each. W(3,3) adds 1 damage to Row 3. W(0,4) adds 1 damage to Row 0. Neither is enough to save the Wall-nuts alone.\n- Add Wall-nuts (J): Cost 50 each. J(3,3) can act as a backup when J(3,2) falls. J(0,3) can act as backup for J(0,2). This buys time.\n- Add Torch Stump (H): Cost 125. H(2,4) could boost W(2,3) (cost 125). H(0,?) or H(3,?) combos are difficult to place without removing plants or are expensive (e.g., W+H combo cost 225, barely helps row 3).\n\nStrategy: Buy time using Wall-nuts and strengthen a currently safe row.\n1.  Plant J(3,3): Costs 50. When J(3,2) falls (Turn 48), R(23-3=20HP) and I(22HP) will attack J(3,3). J(3,3) takes 4 dmg\/turn, lasts 3 turns (until Turn 51). Buys total 5 turns for W(3,1) to attack (deals 5 dmg).\n2.  Plant J(0,3): Costs 50. When J(0,2) falls (Turn 51), R(23-5=18HP) and R(24HP) will attack J(0,3). J(0,3) takes 2 dmg\/turn, lasts 5 turns (until Turn 56). Buys total 10 turns for W(0,1) to attack (deals 10 dmg).\n3.  Plant H(2,4): Costs 125. Cell (2,4) is empty. H(2,4) boosts the Peashooter W(2,3) to its left. W(2,3) damage becomes 2. This strengthens Row 2 against the newly spawning zombies.\n\nTotal cost = 50 + 50 + 125 = 225.\nSun remaining = 235 - 225 = 10.\n\nThis plan addresses the immediate threats by providing backup defenses (buying time) and improves the defense of another row.\n\nAnswer: J 3 3;J 0 3;H 2 4","Answer:","```\nAnswer: J 4 5;W 3 5;W 0 3\n```","```markdown\nAnswer: J 1 4;J 2 5;J 4 5\n```","Answer:","Answer: J 1 3; J 3 3; H 3 0","```\nAnswer: F 3 0;W 0 4\n```","```\nTurn:52 | Sun:395 | Score: 52\n\nCurrent Battlefield (X: Sunflower, W: Peashooter, S: Three-Line Shooter, J: Wall-nut, H: Torch Stump, F: Fire Chili, N: Zombie, R: Roadblock Zombie,B: Bucket Zombie,I: High-Attack Zombie)\nLine0|X  |W  |JR |W  |W  |B  |0\nLine1|X  |W  |JRR|0  |0  |RR |0\nLine2|X  |W  |J  |B  |0  |JR |0\nLine3|X  |W  |I  |JN |0  |0  |0\nLine4|X  |X  |J  |W  |R  |IB |0\n\n```\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Sun Calculation:** Start Turn 53 with 395 (current) + 25 (base) + 6 * 10 (Sunflowers) = 480 sun.\n2.  **Zombie Movement & Attack (Simulated for end of turn 52 -> start of turn 53):**\n    *   Line 0: R(0,2) attacks J(0,2).

The game is played on a 5×7 board, where zombies spawn from the far right side and move one step to the left each turn. The types of plants and zombies are as follows:\n\nPlants  \n- Sunflower (X): Costs 50 sun, has 2 HP, and generates an extra 10 sun each turn.  \n- Peashooter (W): Costs 100 sun, has 2 HP, and deals 1 damage each turn to the first zombie in its current row.  \n- Three-Line Shooter (S): Costs 325 sun, has 2 HP, and deals 1 damage each turn to the first zombie in its current row as well as the first zombie in each of the adjacent rows.  \n- Wall-nut (J): Costs 50 sun and has 10 HP.  \n- Torch Stump (H): Costs 125 sun, has 2 HP; it increases the damage of the plant to its left in the same row (applied directly to the plant rather than to a projectile) by +1, and this effect can only be applied once.  \n- Fire Chili (F): Costs 300 sun and eliminates all zombies in its row.\n\nZombies  \n- Regular Zombie (N): Has 4 HP and deals 1 damage each turn to the plant that blocks its path.  \n- Roadblock Zombie (R): Has 8 HP and deals 1 damage each turn to the plant that blocks its path.  \n- Bucket Zombie (B): Has 12 HP and deals 1 damage each turn to the plant that blocks its path.  \n- High-Attack Zombie (I): Has 6 HP and deals 3 damage each turn to the plant that blocks its path.\n\nRules  \n- At least 25 sun is gained each turn.\n- A new zombie is spawned every 5 turns.\n- After every 10 turns, newly spawned zombies have their HP increased by 4, and the number of zombies spawned increases by 1.\n- Your score increases by 1 each turn.\n- The game lasts for a maximum of 100 turns.\n- Plants cannot be placed on the same grid cell, but zombies can coexist in the same cell.\n- There are no lawn mowers.\n- Roadblock Zombies only spawn after turn 10, and Bucket Zombies and High-Attack Zombies only spawn after turn 20.\n\nPlease input in the format \"PlantType Row Column\".

W(2,0), J(10,1), W(2,2). No zombies.\n- **Line 1:** Critical. JRBN stack (R: 8+12=20HP, B: 12+12=24HP, N: 4+12=16HP; Total 60HP) at col 5 attacking J(10,4). Zombies deal 1+1+1=3 dmg\/turn. J(10,4) will last ceil(10\/3) = 4 turns. Current damage output W(2,1)+W(2,2) = 2 dmg\/turn. This line will be overrun without intervention.\n- **Line 2:** Critical. B (12+12=24HP) at col 5 attacking H(2,5). Zombie deals 1 dmg\/turn. H(2,5) will die this turn. The zombie will then target J(10,4). There is currently NO offensive plant in this row. The zombie will eventually reach the sunflowers.\n- **Line 3:** Threatened. I (6+12=18HP) at col 5 attacking J(10,5). Zombie deals 3 dmg\/turn. J(10,5) will last ceil(10\/3) = 4 turns. Current damage output W(2,0)+W(2,1)+W(2,4) = 3 dmg\/turn. The zombie will die in ceil(18\/3) = 6 turns. The Wall-nut will fall before the zombie dies.\n- **Line 4:** Stable. X(2,0), X(2,1), X(2,2), X(2,3), J(10,4), J(10,5). No zombies.\n\n**Sun Generation:** 25 (base) + 6 * 10 (Sunflowers) = 85 sun\/turn.\n\n**Strategy:**\nLine 2 needs immediate attention as the Torch Stump will fall this turn, and there's no offense to stop the Bucket Zombie (24 HP). A Fire Chili (F) here would solve the problem instantly.\nLine 1 has a massive combined HP threat (60 HP), and the front Wall-nut will fall in 4 turns.\nLine 3's front Wall-nut will also fall in 4 turns, slightly before the zombie is defeated.\n\nOption 1: Use Fire Chili on Line 2.\n- Plant F 2 6 (Cost 300). This clears the Bucket Zombie. Requires an empty spot, column 6 is available.\n- Sun Left: 460 - 300 = 160.\n- Address Line 3: Plant J 3 4 (Cost 50). Provides backup defense.\n- Sun Left: 160 - 50 = 110.\n- Result: Line 2 secured. Line 3 reinforced. Line 1 still has a major threat (60 HP) that needs addressing soon, but the defense holds for 4 turns. This seems like the most balanced approach, prioritizing the line with zero offense.\n\nOption 2: Use Fire Chili on Line 1.\n- Plant F 1 6 (Cost 300). This clears the JRBN stack (60 HP).\n- Sun Left: 460 - 300 = 160.\n- Address Line 2: Need offense. Plant W 2 3 (replace X) (Cost 100). Torch Stump dies, B(24HP) moves to attack J(10,4). W provides 1 damage.\n- Sun Left: 160 - 100 = 60.\n- Result: Line 1 secured. Line 2 has offense, but B(24HP) vs W(1dmg) is slow, and a sunflower was lost. Line 3 threat remains, J(10,5) falls in 4 turns. Need to reinforce Line 3 soon (e.g., J 3 4 next turn).\n\nConclusion: Option 1 is better. It deals with the immediate lack of offense on Line 2 and reinforces Line 3. While Line 1 remains a problem, we retain higher sun generation and have a few turns plus remaining sun (110) to address it.\n\n**Action:**\nPlant Fire Chili in Row 2, Column 6.\nPlant Wall-nut in Row 3, Column 4.\n\nAnswer: F 2 6;J 3 4","Okay, let's analyze the situation at Turn 39.\n\n1.  **Sun:** 275. Next turn gain: 25 (base) + 6 * 10 (Sunflowers) = 85. Sun at start of Turn 40 = 275 + 85 = 360.\n2.  **Threats:**\n    *   Line 1: A stack of zombies (R, B, N) is attacking J(1,4). Total incoming damage is 1+1+1 = 3 per turn. J(1,4) has 10 HP and will last ceil(10\/3) = 4 turns. The first zombie (R) has 8 + 12 = 20 HP (Base + Turn 10, 20, 30 bonuses). Current damage output on Line 1 is from W(1,1) and W(1,2), totaling 1+1=2 damage per turn. It will take ceil(20\/2) = 10 turns to kill the Roadblock Zombie alone.\n    *   Line 3: A High-Attack Zombie (I) is attacking J(3,3). Incoming damage is 3 per turn. J(3,3) has 10 HP and will last ceil(10\/3) = 4 turns. The High-Attack Zombie has 6 + 12 = 18 HP (Base + Turn 20, 30 bonuses). Current damage output on Line 3 is from W(3,4), totaling 1 damage per turn. It will take ceil(18\/1) = 18 turns to kill it with just W(3,4). W(3,1) and W(3,0) will help once J(3,3) and J(3,2) fall.\n3.  **Turn 40:** Next turn is a zombie spawn turn. Spawn count increases to 1 + (40\/10) = 5 zombies. HP bonus increases to 4 * (40\/10) = 16. This will be a significant wave.\n4.  **Options:**\n    *   Plant Peashooters (W, 100 sun): Cannot place W at 1,0 (Sunflower present). Can place W at 3,0. This increases damage on line 3 to 1+1+1=3. Kills Zombie I in ceil(18\/3)=6 turns. J(3,3) still falls in 4 turns. Costs 100 sun, leaving 175. Sun at T40: 175+85=260.\n    *   Plant Torch Stump (H, 125 sun): Place H at 3,5. Boosts W(3,4) damage to 2. Total line 3 damage: 1(W3,0)+1(W3,1)+2(W3,4)=4. Kills Zombie I in ceil(18\/4)=5 turns. J(3,3) falls in 4 turns. Costs 125 sun, leaving 150. Sun at T40: 150+85=235.\n    *   Plant Wall-nut (J, 50 sun): No good spots to reinforce without removing attackers.\n    *   Save Sun: Wait for Turn 40. Sun will be 360. This allows planting a Three-Line Shooter (S, 325 sun). Placing S at 2,0 would attack lines 1, 2, and 3.\n        *   Damage Line 1: 1(W1,1)+1(W1,2)+1(S2,0)=3.

Helps, but not enough to quickly resolve the critical threats on Line 3 or 4.\n\nDecision: Using Fire Chili on Line 3 provides the most significant immediate relief by eliminating 116 total HP worth of zombies pressing against a weakening defense with offensive plants behind it. This buys crucial time.\n\nAnswer: F 3 0\n```","Answer: F 2 5;J 4 3","Okay, let's analyze the board and plan the defense.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Line 0:** `W | J | W | WN | 0 | 0 | 0` - A Peashooter (W at 0,3) is being attacked by a Normal Zombie (N). The two Peashooters (W at 0,2 and 0,3) are attacking it. Seems relatively stable, but could use more damage eventually.\n2.  **Line 1:** `X | W | W | X | J | 0 | 0` - Well-defended, good sunflower placement. No immediate threat.\n3.  **Line 2:** `X | X | X | X | 0 | 0 | J` - Lots of sunflowers, but no offensive plants. The Wall-nut (J at 2,6) is far back. This line needs offense before zombies arrive.\n4.  **Line 3:** `W | W | JRBRR | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0` - Critical situation. The Wall-nut (J at 3,2) is under heavy attack from multiple high-HP zombies (R, B, R, R). The two Peashooters (W at 3,0 and 3,1) are firing, but likely not enough damage. The J will fall soon.\n5.  **Line 4:** `X | X | X | X | JIIB | 0 | 0` - Extremely critical. The Wall-nut (J at 4,4) is being attacked by two High-Attack Zombies (I) and one Bucket Zombie (B). Damage per turn = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7. The J only has 10 HP and will likely fall next turn, exposing the sunflowers. There's no space behind the J to plant another defensive unit before the sunflowers.\n6.  **Sun:** 275. Enough for a couple of Peashooters and a Wall-nut, or maybe a Torch Stump and another plant. Not enough for a Three-Line Shooter (325) or Fire Chili (300).\n7.  **Turn:** 55. 6 new zombies (with +20 HP) will spawn this turn.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n*   Line 4 is almost certainly lost in the front. The J(4,4) will fall, and the zombies will reach the sunflowers. We cannot afford a Fire Chili (F) and cannot place backup defense effectively.\n*   Line 3 needs immediate offensive reinforcement to try and take down the zombie stack before J(3,2) falls.\n*   Line 2 needs offense added before zombies eventually reach it.\n*   We should prioritize adding damage to Line 3 and initiating offense on Line 2.\n\n**Proposed Actions:**\n\n1.  **Plant Peashooter (W) at (3,3):** Cost 100 Sun. Adds +1 damage per turn to the tough zombies in Line 3, placed behind the existing J(3,2). (Sun: 275 - 100 = 175)\n2.  **Plant Peashooter (W) at (2,4):** Cost 100 Sun. Adds offense to Line 2, placed in front of the sunflowers but behind where a future Wall-nut might go. (Sun: 175 - 100 = 75)\n3.  **Plant Wall-nut (J) at (2,5):** Cost 50 Sun. Provides a defensive front for Line 2, protecting the new Peashooter and the sunflowers. (Sun: 75 - 50 = 25)\n\nThis plan addresses the urgent need for more damage in Line 3, adds necessary offense to Line 2, and sets up defense for Line 2, spending 250 Sun.\n\nAnswer: W 3 3;W 2 4;J 2 5","Answer: J 4 2;J 2 5;X 0 4","```markdown\n","Okay, let's assess the situation and decide the best course of action.\n\n**Threat Analysis:**\n1.  **Line 3:** The W at (3,0) has 2 HP and is facing 3 zombies (RBR) dealing 1+1+1=3 damage. It will be destroyed this turn, and the zombies will advance. This is the most immediate threat.\n2.  **Line 4:** The X at (4,2) has 2 HP and is facing 3 zombies (IIB) dealing 3+3+1=7 damage. It will be destroyed this turn, and the zombies will advance. This is also an immediate threat.\n3.  **Line 2:** The J at (2,5) has 10 HP and is facing 2 I zombies dealing 3+3=6 damage. It will last for 10\/6 = 1.66 turns (so it will die on turn 60). This is a serious threat but slightly less immediate than lines 3 and 4.\n4.  **Line 0:** The W at (0,2) has 2 HP and is facing 1 N zombie dealing 1 damage. It will be destroyed this turn. The J at (0,1) will then block the N zombie. This is manageable.\n5.  **Line 1:** The J at (1,4) has 10 HP and is facing 1 N zombie dealing 1 damage. It is stable for now.\n\n**Priorities:**\nAddress the immediate breakthroughs on Lines 3 and 4. Line 4 has higher damage zombies (IIB).\n\n**Sun:** 360\n\n**Options:**\n*   Use Fire Chili (F) on Line 4 to eliminate the dangerous IIB stack at (4,2). Cost: 300 sun. Remaining: 60 sun.\n*   With the remaining 60 sun, plant a Wall-nut (J) on Line 3 at (3,0) to block the RBR stack after W(3,0) falls. Cost: 50 sun. Remaining: 10 sun.\n\nThis plan eliminates the high-damage threat on Line 4 and stalls the threat on Line 3.

The Bucket Zombie (B) poses a significant threat to the sunflowers behind it.\n\nStrategy:\n- H(3,4) and W(4,5) cannot be saved with current sun.\n- The most critical immediate threat is the Bucket Zombie (B) in Row 2 reaching the Sunflowers. Placing a Wall-nut (J) in front of it is the highest priority.\n- Planting J at (2,4) costs 50 sun, leaving 220. This Wall-nut (10 HP) will block the Bucket Zombie (1 damage\/turn) and the JR zombies behind it (2 damage\/turn), holding the line for 10 \/ (1+2) = 3 turns.\n- Saving the remaining 220 sun is advisable. Next turn, sun will be 220 + 95 = 315. This allows planting a Fire Chili (F, 300 sun) in either Row 3 or Row 4 to deal with the advancing zombies after H(3,4) and W(4,5) are destroyed.\n\nAction: Plant a Wall-nut in Row 2, Column 4.\n\n```Answer: J 2 4```","行和列必须为整数。","```\nTurn:43 | Sun:385 | Score: 43\n\nLine 1 has the largest concentration of zombies (JRNR = 92 HP total) attacking a J(10 HP).

The types of plants and zombies are as follows:\n\nPlants  \n- Sunflower (X): Costs 50 sun, has 2 HP, and generates an extra 10 sun each turn.  \n- Peashooter (W): Costs 100 sun, has 2 HP, and deals 1 damage each turn to the first zombie in its current row.  \n- Three-Line Shooter (S): Costs 325 sun, has 2 HP, and deals 1 damage each turn to the first zombie in its current row as well as the first zombie in each of the adjacent rows.  \n- Wall-nut (J): Costs 50 sun and has 10 HP.  \n- Torch Stump (H): Costs 125 sun, has 2 HP; it increases the damage of the plant to its left in the same row (applied directly to the plant rather than to a projectile) by +1, and this effect can only be applied once.  \n- Fire Chili (F): Costs 300 sun and eliminates all zombies in its row.\n\nZombies  \n- Regular Zombie (N): Has 4 HP and deals 1 damage each turn to the plant that blocks its path.  \n- Roadblock Zombie (R): Has 8 HP and deals 1 damage each turn to the plant that blocks its path.  \n- Bucket Zombie (B): Has 12 HP and deals 1 damage each turn to the plant that blocks its path.  \n- High-Attack Zombie (I): Has 6 HP and deals 3 damage each turn to the plant that blocks its path.\n\nRules  \n- At least 25 sun is gained each turn.\n- A new zombie is spawned every 5 turns.\n- After every 10 turns, newly spawned zombies have their HP increased by 4, and the number of zombies spawned increases by 1.\n- Your score increases by 1 each turn.\n- The game lasts for a maximum of 100 turns.\n- Plants cannot be placed on the same grid cell, but zombies can coexist in the same cell.\n- There are no lawn mowers.\n- Roadblock Zombies only spawn after turn 10, and Bucket Zombies and High-Attack Zombies only spawn after turn 20.\n\nPlease input in the format \"PlantType Row Column\".

Increase sun production.\n\nOptions with 120 Sun:\n1.  W 2 3 (Cost 100): Adds offense in Row 2 to deal with the R zombie. Leaves 20 sun. Next turn 20 + 85 = 105 sun. This addresses the immediate threat in Row 2. The W will start attacking the R zombie next turn when it reaches column 4.\n2.  W 0 2 (Cost 100): Adds offense in Row 0. Leaves 20 sun. Next turn 105 sun. However, W at col 0 is already attacking the first zombie (N at col 1). Adding W at col 2 won't help immediately against N at col 1, but will help against N at col 5 once N at col 1 is dead.\n3.  X 1 2 or X 3 1 (Cost 50): Boosts economy. Leaves 70 sun. Next turn 70 + (85+10) = 165 sun. Good for long term, but delays addressing threats.\n4.  J 3 1 (Cost 50): Starts defense in Row 3. Leaves 70 sun. Next turn 70 + 85 = 155 sun. Row 3 has no immediate threat.\n5.  W 3 1 (Cost 100): Starts offense\/defense in Row 3. Leaves 20 sun. Next turn 105 sun. Row 3 has no immediate threat.\n\nComparison:\n- Option 1 (W 2 3) directly counters the most dangerous immediate threat (R zombie vs Wall-nut). The Wall-nut only has 10 HP, and the R zombie has 8 HP. Adding a Peashooter will help take it down faster.\n- Other options either address less immediate threats or focus on economy\/future defense.\n\nDecision: Planting a Peashooter in Row 2 behind the existing sunflowers and Wall-nut is the best tactical move.

Sun gain\/turn: 25 (base) + 11 * 10 (Sunflowers) = 135. Sun next turn: 265 + 135 = 400.\n2.  **Critical Threats:**\n    *   S(2,5) [HP 2] is attacked by B(2,6) [Damage 1]. S(2,5) will die next turn (Turn 38). Losing S is catastrophic as it damages rows 1, 2, and 3.\n    *   H(1,6) [HP 2] is attacked by N(1,6) [Damage 1]. H(1,6) will die next turn (Turn 38). Loses damage buff for W(1,5).\n    *   X(1,2) [HP 2] is attacked by B(1,3) [Damage 1].

If S(2,5) dies, I\/R stop taking damage from it.\n3.  **Saving S(2,5):** Requires killing B(2,6) [HP 24] this turn. Current damage is 2\/turn (from S+H). Need 24 damage instantly. Only Fire Chili (F, 300 sun) can do this. Cannot afford F this turn (need 35 more sun).\n4.  **Mitigation Strategy:** Since S(2,5) seems doomed this turn, the best approach is to save sun to deal with the consequences next turn using a Fire Chili (F).\n5.  **Plan:** Do not spend heavily this turn. Preserve sun to use F (300 sun) on Turn 38. Using F on Row 3 next turn seems best, as it will eliminate the dangerous I\/R zombies (which stop taking damage when S dies) and save J(3,5) and the rest of Row 3's defenses\/sunflowers. Using F on Row 2 would save the sunflowers there but S(2,5) is already lost. Row 3 preservation seems slightly more valuable.\n6.  **Action for Turn 37:** To save sun while making a valid move, plant a cheap Sunflower (X, 50 sun) in a safe spot. This slightly increases future sun generation. Column 6 in Row 4 is empty and safe for now.\n\n**Decision:** Plant Sunflower in Row 4, Column 6.\n\n```\nAnswer: X 4 6\n```","```plant\nTurn:38 | Sun:370 | Score: 38\n\nThreat Analysis:\n- Line 0: N at (0,2) attacking J(0,2). J HP is likely high (let's assume 10). N HP (Turn 38 base) = 16. W(0,0) deals 1 dmg\/turn. J takes 1 dmg\/turn. J will outlast N, but adding offense helps.\n- Line 1: B at (1,3) attacking X(1,3). B HP (Turn 38 base) = 24. X HP = 2. B deals 1 dmg. X(1,3) will survive this turn (HP 2->1). Next turn it falls. B will then target X(1,2). S(2,5) hits B for 1 dmg\/turn. N at (1,6) HP=16, W(1,5) hits it (1 dmg\/turn). Need defense behind X(1,3).\n- Line 2: B at (2,6) attacking J(2,6). B HP=24. J HP=10. B deals 1 dmg. S(2,5) hits B for 1 dmg\/turn. J takes 1 dmg\/turn. Looks stable for now.\n- Line 3: R at (3,4) and I at (3,5). R HP (Turn 38 base)=20. I HP (Turn 38 base)=18. They attack J(3,4) (HP=10). I will move to (3,4) this turn. R deals 1 dmg, I deals 3 dmg. J(3,4) takes 4 dmg\/turn. J will fall in 3 turns (10 -> 6 -> 2 -> -2). S(2,5) hits R for 1 dmg\/turn.

Currently 7HP, takes 3 damage. Will survive this turn and next turn. Planting J(3,4) now would place it on top of the existing J(3,4) which isn't allowed. I should plant it *behind* the current one, e.g., J(3,3)? But R(3,3) is attacking J(3,3). Planting J(3,4) must mean replacing the current one. Yes, you can replace a plant.

Sun generation: 25 (base) + 9 * 10 (Sunflowers) = 115 sun\/turn.\n2.  **Turn:** 49. Turn 50 is a zombie spawn turn (6 zombies) and zombie HP increase turn (+4 HP, total +20 HP).\n3.  **Threats:**\n    *   Line 0: Roadblock Zombie (R) at (0, 2) has 8 + 16 = 24 HP. It attacks Wall-nut (J) at (0, 1). Damage per turn on R: W(0, 0) = 1 + S(2, 5) boosted by H(2, 4) = 2. Total = 3 dmg\/turn. R needs 24\/3 = 8 turns to kill. J(0, 1) has 10 HP and takes 1 dmg\/turn, breaks in 10 turns. This lane is safe for now.\n    *   Line 1: Bucket Zombie (B) at (1, 4) has 12 + 16 = 28 HP. It attacks Wall-nut (J) at (1, 4). Damage per turn on B: W(1, 3) = 1 + S(2, 5) boosted by H(2, 4) = 2. Total = 3 dmg\/turn. B needs 28\/3 ≈ 9.33 -> 10 turns to kill. J(1, 4) has 10 HP and takes 1 dmg\/turn, breaks in 10 turns. This lane is critical; the zombie dies exactly when the Wall-nut breaks.\n    *   Line 3: Normal Zombie (N) at (3, 4) has 4 + 16 = 20 HP. It attacks Wall-nut (J) at (3, 4). Damage per turn on N: S(2, 5) boosted by H(2, 4) = 2. Total = 2 dmg\/turn. N needs 20\/2 = 10 turns to kill. J(3, 4) has 10 HP and takes 1 dmg\/turn, breaks in 10 turns. This lane is also critical. However, after J(3, 4) breaks, N will attack J(3, 3), which will take another 10 turns to break. N will be killed before breaking J(3,3). So this lane is ultimately safe.\n4.  **Strategy:** The most pressing issue is Line 1, where the Bucket Zombie will break the Wall-nut at the same time it dies. Boosting the damage in Line 1 is necessary. Placing a Torch Stump (H) at (1, 5) will boost the Peashooter (W) at (1, 3).\n5.  **Action:** Place H at (1, 5).\n    *   Cost: 125 sun. Current sun: 135.

Sun: 145. Sun income\/turn = 25 (base) + 8 * 10 (Sunflowers) = 105.\n2.  Turn 50: Zombie spawn turn. 5 zombies will spawn with Base HP + 16.\n3.  Row 0: R zombie at (0,2) attacking J at (0,1). W(0,0) deals 1 damage\/turn to R. R has high HP (up to 24). J(0,1) has 10 HP and takes 1 damage\/turn. J(0,1) will fall in 10 turns. R will take 24 turns to kill. J(0,1) needs reinforcement or R needs more damage.\n4.  Row 1: B zombie at (1,4) attacking J at (1,4). B takes 2 damage from W(1,3)+H(1,5) and 1 damage from S(2,5), total 3 damage\/turn. B has high HP (up to 28). J(1,4) has 10 HP and takes 1 damage\/turn. Time to kill B: ~28\/3 ≈ 9.3 turns. Time for J to die: 10 turns. This row seems stable for now.\n5.  Row 3: N zombie at (3,4) attacking J at (3,4). N takes 1 damage from S(2,5). N has high HP (up to 20). J(3,4) has 10 HP and takes 1 damage\/turn. Time to kill N: 20 turns. Time for J to die: 10 turns. J(3,4) will fall, N will advance to J(3,3). This row needs more offensive power, but there's no immediate space for a Peashooter without removing a Sunflower.\n6.  Row 4: Clear for now.\n\nPriority: Address the imminent fall of J(0,1) and the eventual breach in Row 3.\n\nOption 1: Add defense. Plant Wall-nut (J) costs 50.\n    - Plant J at (0,3). Cost 50. Sun left 95. Provides backup for Row 0. When J(0,1) falls, R moves to (0,1) then (0,2) attacking J(0,3). This buys significant time for W(0,0) to attack R.\nOption 2: Add offense to Row 3. Replace X(3,2) with W(3,2). Cost 100. Sun left 45. Reduces sun income by 10. Doubles damage to N(3,4) (now 2\/turn), potentially saving J(3,4) and J(3,3).\nOption 3: Add offense to Row 0. Plant W at (0,3). Cost 100. Sun left 45. Doubles damage to R(0,2) (now 2\/turn). R (max 24 HP) dies in 12 turns. J(0,1) still dies in 10 turns. Not sufficient alone.\n\nComparison:\n- Planting J(0,3) (Option 1) is cheap and effectively shores up Row 0 defense for a while. It leaves enough sun (95) to consider replacing X(3,2) with W(3,2) next turn (need 100, will have 95 + 105 = 200).\n- Replacing X(3,2) with W(3,2) (Option 2) now addresses Row 3 immediately but leaves Row 0 vulnerable and reduces sun income.\n- Planting W(0,3) (Option 3) isn't enough to save J(0,1).\n\nStrategy: Plant J(0,3) this turn to secure Row 0's defense. Save remaining sun to strengthen Row 3's offense next turn.\n\nAction: Plant Wall-nut in Row 0, Column 3.\n\nAnswer: J 0 3\n```","```\nAnswer: J 0 1;J 3 4;W 0 2\n```","Answer: J 2 3; W 2 2; W 3 2","```\nAnswer: F 2 6;J 3 3;J 4 3\n```","```\nAnswer: J 1 2;H 3 2\n```","```\nAnswer: F 1 0;J 3 4;J 4 3\n```","```\nTurn:56 | Sun:455 | Score: 56\n\nCurrent Battlefield (X: Sunflower, W: Peashooter, S: Three-Line Shooter, J: Wall-nut, H: Torch Stump, F: Fire Chili, N: Zombie, R: Roadblock Zombie,B: Bucket Zombie,I: High-Attack Zombie)\nLine0|W  |J  |W  |JN |0  |0  |B  \nLine1|X  |X  |XB |B  |0  |0  |I  \nLine2|X  |X  |X  |X  |H  |0  |R  \nLine3|X  |X  |X  |NI |J  |0  |NI \nLine4|W  |J  |X  |WI |0  |0  |N  \n```\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Row 1:** The Bucket Zombie (B) at (1,3) will destroy the Sunflower (X) at (1,2) this turn. Immediate action is required. Replacing the Sunflower with a Wall-nut (J) is necessary for defense. Adding offense is also needed.\n2.  **Row 4:** The High-Attack Zombie (I) at (4,3) will destroy the Peashooter (W) at (4,3) this turn (3 damage vs 2 HP). The zombie will then attack the Sunflower (X) at (4,2). A Wall-nut (J) should be placed at (4,3) to block it.\n3.  **Row 3:** The Wall-nut (J) at (3,4) is under attack by N (1 dmg) and I (3 dmg), taking 4 damage per turn. It has 10 HP and will fall soon. Adding an attacking plant like a Peashooter (W) is advisable.\n4.  **Row 2:** This row has no offense, only Sunflowers and a Torch Stump (H). Planting a Peashooter (W) at (2,3) would benefit from the Torch Stump's damage boost.\n5.  **Row 0:** The Wall-nut (J) at (0,3) is attacked by N (1 dmg). It has 10 HP and will last for a while. The two Peashooters (W) are dealing damage. This row is less urgent but needs monitoring.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Plant J at (1,2):** Replace the doomed Sunflower to block the Bucket Zombie (B). Cost: 50 sun. Sun: 455 - 50 = 405.\n2.  **Plant J at (4,3):** Replace the doomed Peashooter to block the High-Attack Zombie (I) and protect the Sunflower. Cost: 50 sun. Sun: 405 - 50 = 355.\n3.  **Plant W at (1,0):** Add offense in Row 1 to start dealing with the Bucket Zombie. Cost: 100 sun. Sun: 355 - 100 = 255.\n4.  **Plant W at (3,2):** Add offense in Row 3 to help the struggling Wall-nut. Cost: 100 sun. Sun: 255 - 100 = 155.\n5.  **Plant W at (2,3):** Add offense in Row 2, utilizing the Torch Stump boost. Cost: 100 sun. Sun: 155 - 100 = 55.\n\nTotal Cost: 50 + 50 + 100 + 100 + 100 = 400 sun.

The I+N stack deals 4 damage per turn to J(4,1) (10 HP). It will likely fall within 1-2 turns. If it falls this turn, the zombies reach column 0 next turn, potentially leading to a game over. The only reliable way to clear this high-HP, high-damage threat seems to be the Fire Chili (F), which costs 300 sun.\n\nSimultaneously, in Line 2, the R zombie (28 HP) is attacking H(2,4) (2 HP). H(2,4) will fall this turn or next, and the R will advance.\n\nIn Line 0, the N+B stack (56 HP total) is slowly chewing through J(0,3) (10 HP), taking only 1 damage per turn from W(0,2).\n\nCurrent Sun: 240.

Next turn: 230 + 25 (base) + 8*10 (sunflowers) = 335.\n4.  **Options:**\n    *   Add Peashooters (W, 100 sun) to lanes 3 and 4 for more damage.\n    *   Add Torch Stump (H, 125 sun) to boost existing Peashooters.\n    *   Save for a Three-Line Shooter (S, 325 sun) next turn.\n    *   Use Fire Chili (F, 300 sun).\n\nStrategy: Address both immediate threats with Peashooters. Placing W at (3,0) increases damage on R in Lane 3. Placing W at (4,2) increases damage on B in Lane 4. This uses existing Peashooter positions effectively and replaces less critical Sunflowers.\n\n*   Place W at (3,0): Costs 100 sun. Replaces X(3,0). Adds 1 damage to R.\n*   Place W at (4,2): Costs 100 sun. Replaces X(4,2). Adds 1 damage to B.\n\nTotal cost: 100 + 100 = 200 sun. Remaining sun: 30.\n\nDecision: Plant Peashooters in lanes 3 and 4 to increase damage output against the tough zombies.\n\nAnswer: W 3 0;W 4 2\n```","```\nAnswer: J 3 2;W 4 2\n```","Answer: F 4 0;W 3 0;J 0 2","```markdown\n```\nAnswer: F 3 5;W 1 3;W 4 2\n```","```\nAnswer: F 4 0;X 0 3\n```","Answer: F 4 0;J 1 3","```markdown\nAnswer: F 4 3;W 1 3;W 1 2","```plantuml\n@startuml\n!define PLANT(p) class p << (P,lightblue) >>\n!define ZOMBIE(z) class z << (Z,lightcoral) >>\n!define EMPTY(e) class e << (E,lightgrey) >>\n\npackage \"Plants\" {\n    PLANT(X) #Sunflower { HP=2; Cost=50; SunGen=10 }\n    PLANT(W) #Peashooter { HP=2; Cost=100; Dmg=1 }\n    PLANT(S) #Three-Line Shooter { HP=2; Cost=325; Dmg=1 (3 rows) }\n    PLANT(J) #Wall-nut { HP=10; Cost=50 }\n    PLANT(H) #Torch Stump { HP=2; Cost=125; DmgBuff=+1 }\n    PLANT(F) #Fire Chili { HP=N\/A; Cost=300; Effect=Row Clear }\n}\n\npackage \"Zombies\" {\n    ZOMBIE(N) #Regular Zombie { HP=4; Dmg=1 }\n    ZOMBIE(R) #Roadblock Zombie { HP=8; Dmg=1 }\n    ZOMBIE(B) #Bucket Zombie { HP=12; Dmg=1 }\n    ZOMBIE(I) #High-Attack Zombie { HP=6; Dmg=3 }\n}\n\npackage \"Game Rules\" {\n    class Rules {\n        Sun\/Turn >= 25\n        New Zombie Spawn Rate = 1 \/ 5 Turns\n        Spawn Buff Rate = Every 10 Turns (+4 HP, +1 Zombie)\n        Score Rate = +1 \/ Turn\n        Max Turns = 100\n        No Lawn Mowers\n        R Spawn > Turn 10\n        B, I Spawn > Turn 20\n    }\n}\n\npackage \"Turn 35 State\" {\n    class GameState {\n        Turn = 35\n        Sun = 735\n        Score = 35\n    }\n    note \"Zombie HP Buff: +12\\nZombie Spawn Count: 3\" as BuffNote\n    GameState ..

Their combined HP, considering the turn 35 buff (+12 HP), is (12+12) + (4+12) = 24 + 16 = 40 HP. They are not currently being attacked and will move to column 2 next turn, destroying the Sunflower (X) there. This needs immediate action. A Fire Chili (F) costs 300 sun and will instantly clear the entire row, eliminating both zombies. This is the most effective solution.\n2.  **Row 1 Threat:** There's a Roadblock Zombie (R) attacking a Wall-nut (J) at column 4. The Roadblock Zombie's HP is 8 + 12 = 20 HP. The Wall-nut has 10 HP and the zombie deals 1 damage per turn, so the Wall-nut will last 10 turns. There are no attacking plants in this row. After the Wall-nut falls, the zombie will advance. Planting a Peashooter would take too long to deal 20 damage, especially if placed behind the sunflowers where it can shoot longer. A Fire Chili (F) costs 300 sun and will eliminate the zombie instantly.\n3.  **Sun:** We have 735 sun. Planting two Fire Chilis costs 300 + 300 = 600 sun. We have enough sun (735 - 600 = 135 remaining).\n\n**Decision:** Plant two Fire Chilis to eliminate the immediate threats in rows 1 and 4.

Sun at start of Turn 39 will be 265 + 135 = 400.\n2.  **Row 3 Threat:** The Roadblock Zombie (R) at (3,4) has 20 HP (Base 8 + 12 from turns 31-40 bonus). It attacks the Torch Stump (H) at (3,3), which has 2 HP. The H will fall in 2 turns. The Peashooter (W) at (3,2) is boosted by H, dealing 2 damage per turn to the R. This R will take 10 turns to kill (20 HP \/ 2 DMG\/turn). However, H dies first (at end of Turn 39). Once H dies, W's damage drops to 1, and the R (which will have taken some damage) will proceed to attack W (2 HP), then J (10 HP), then X (2 HP). Row 3 is in danger.\n3.  **Row 1 Threat:** The Roadblock Zombie (R) at (1,4) has 20 HP. It attacks the Wall-nut (J) at (1,4), which has 10 HP. The J will last 10 turns. There is no plant currently dealing damage to this zombie.\n4.  **Turn 39 Plan:** The immediate threat is Row 3. The H dying removes the crucial damage boost. At the start of Turn 39, we will have 400 sun. Planting a Fire Chili (F, cost 300) in Row 3 would eliminate the R(3,3) instantly, solving the Row 3 problem for now. This requires surviving Turn 38.\n5.  **Turn 38 Action - Addressing Row 1:** Since we plan to use F on Row 3 next turn, we should use Turn 38's sun (265) to reinforce Row 1.\n    *   Option A: Plant Peashooter (W) at (1,3). Costs 100 sun (Sun left: 165). W starts damaging R(1,4). R(1,4) kills J(1,4) in 10 turns. W deals 1 damage\/turn. R(1,4) will take 20 turns to kill, J(1,4) dies first. R will reach W(1,3) and kill it quickly (2 HP). Not ideal.\n    *   Option B: Plant Wall-nut (J) at (1,3). Costs 50 sun (Sun left: 215). This provides a second layer of defense. When R(1,4) breaks through J(1,4) (after 10 turns, around Turn 48), it will encounter J(1,3). This stalls the zombie much longer, giving time to build offense.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Planting J at (1,3) is the better immediate move. It costs less sun, provides better long-term defense for Row 1, and sets up the Fire Chili play for Row 3 in the next turn.\n\nAction: Plant J at (1,3).\n\nAnswer: J 1 3","Answer: J 3 4;S 2 0","```text\nAnswer: W 1 3;W 4 2\n```","Okay, let's analyze the board and plan the next move.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Sun:** 620.

Needs significant reinforcement due to R and upcoming I.\n    - Line 4: Bucket Zombie (B) at (4, 6). No offensive plant in this row. Needs a shooter.\n- **Opportunities:**\n    - Using a Three-Line Shooter (S) could address multiple lines simultaneously. Placing S at (2,0) would hit lines 1, 2, and 3.\n    - Placing S at (3,0) would hit lines 2, 3, and 4.\n    - Placing S at (1,0) would hit lines 0, 1, and 2.\n    - A Fire Chili (F) on line 3 (cost 300) would eliminate both the R and I zombies, significantly reducing the threat there.\n    - A Fire Chili (F) on line 1 (cost 300) would eliminate R and the two B zombies.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Address the high-priority threat on Line 3 (R and I). A Fire Chili is effective but costly and only solves one line temporarily. A Three-Line Shooter provides sustained damage across multiple lanes.\n2.  Address the lack of offense on Line 4.\n3.  Reinforce Line 1 and Line 2.\n\n**Proposed Action:**\nPlant a Three-Line Shooter (S) in column 0 of Row 2. This replaces the Sunflower X(2,0). It will hit zombies in rows 1, 2, and 3.

Replacing it ensures the lane holds. Cost: 50 sun.\n2.  **Plant Torch Stump (H 0 0):** Place a Torch Stump behind the Wall-nut at (0,0) to boost the Peashooter at (0,1).

A Bucket Zombie (B) is at (0,5) (HP 32).\nLine 2: The Wall-nut (J) at (2,4) has 10 HP and is being attacked by a Bucket Zombie (B) (1 damage\/turn). It currently has 10 HP. Zombies (I, R, R) are at (2,5) and will reach (2,4) next turn, increasing the damage significantly (1+3+1+1 = 6 damage\/turn). The Peashooter (W) at (2,2) and the Three-Line Shooter (S) at (3,2) are both hitting the B zombie (total 2 damage\/turn).\nLine 3: The Wall-nut (J) at (3,4) has 10 HP. A Bucket Zombie (B) is at (3,5) and will reach (3,4) next turn to start attacking (1 damage\/turn).

Adding a Peashooter (W 0 3) would cost 100 sun but only increase damage slightly (from 1 to 2 per turn against 2x 26 HP zombies).\nSaving sun for a Fire Chili (F, cost 300) next turn seems powerful. Next turn, sun will be 265 + 125 = 390. Using F on Line 0 would eliminate both I zombies and the approaching B zombie, saving J(0,2).\nTo enable this while also preparing for the eventual breach if J(0,2) falls before F can be used (or if F is needed elsewhere), planting a backup Wall-nut (J) at (0,3) is a good defensive measure. It costs only 50 sun.\n\nPlan:\n1. Plant a Wall-nut at (0,3) for 50 sun. (Remaining sun: 265 - 50 = 215)\n2. Next turn (Turn 58), sun will be 215 + 125 = 340.

Zombies will spawn this turn (5 zombies with +16 HP).\n2.  **Sun:** 175. Next turn's sun: 25 (base) + 70 (7 sunflowers, as X at 4,1 will be destroyed) = 95. Total sun next turn will be 175 - spent + 95.\n3.  **Line 0:** Relatively stable with W-J-W-J defense.\n4.  **Line 1:** Completely undefended, highly vulnerable.\n5.  **Line 2:** Fragmented defense. W at (2,5) and J at (2,6) are likely gone or useless soon. Relies on J(2,1) and W(2,2).\n6.  **Line 3:** Decent defense with J-W-J.\n7.  **Line 4:** Critical situation.\n    *   The Bucket Zombie (B) at (4,1) will destroy the Sunflower (X) this turn. Zombie HP = 12 + 16 = 28.\n    *   The Roadblock Zombie (R) at (4,5) will destroy the Peashooter (W) this turn. Zombie HP = 8 + 16 = 24.\n    *   Immediate action is needed here to prevent zombies from reaching the house.\n\n**Priorities:**\n\n1.  Shore up Line 4 defense immediately.\n2.  Start building defense on Line 1.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n*   The Bucket Zombie at (4,1) will destroy the Sunflower and move to (4,0) next turn. Placing a Wall-nut (J) at (4,0) will block it. (Cost: 50 sun)\n*   The Roadblock Zombie at (4,5) will destroy the Peashooter and move to (4,4) next turn, where the existing Peashooter (W) at (4,4) will engage it. Adding another Peashooter behind it, at (4,3), will provide more firepower against the advancing zombies on this line. (Cost: 100 sun)\n\n**Action:**\n\n1.  Plant Wall-nut (J) at Row 4, Column 0.\n2.  Plant Peashooter (W) at Row 4, Column 3.\n\nTotal Cost: 50 + 100 = 150 sun.\nSun Remaining: 175 - 150 = 25 sun.\n\nThis plan directly addresses the most critical threat on Line 4 by placing a blocker for the strong Bucket Zombie and adding firepower further back.\n\nAnswer: J 4 0;W 4 3","```\nAnswer: J 1 4;J 4 2;W 2 4;X 0 5\n```","```\nAnswer: W 1 1;J 1 3\n```","```\nAnswer: W 2 5;W 4 4;J 1 3\n```","Answer: F 1 3;W 2 1","Answer: F 1 0;W 4 1;H 3 1","```\nAnswer: F 0 6; F 1 6; J 2 2; W 4 4\n```","Okay, let's analyze the threats and resources.\n\n*   **Sun:** 190.

Three Peashooters deal 3 damage\/turn. It will take about 11 turns to defeat it. The J at column 3 will likely fall.\n*   **Row 3:** A Roadblock Zombie (28 HP) is attacking the J at column 3. The J has 10 HP and will last 10 turns against this zombie. A Peashooter (W 3 2) deals 1 damage\/turn. Two more zombies (N 24 HP, R 28 HP) are at column 5 and will reach the J at column 3 in 2 turns. This row needs more damage.\n*   **Row 4:** Two Roadblock Zombies (28 HP each) are attacking the J at column 3. The J has 10 HP and takes 2 damage\/turn, so it will last 5 turns. There are no attacking plants in this row. This is the most critical row.\n\n**Priority:** Row 4 needs immediate offensive support.\n\n**Action:** Plant a Peashooter in Row 4 to start dealing damage. Placing it at column 1 behind the Sunflowers is safe.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Plant Peashooter (W) in Row 4, Column 1.

W(2,5) has 2HP and will die next turn. Using a Fire Chili (F, 300 sun) on this row is the most efficient way to eliminate this immediate high-HP threat (60HP) and save the Peashooter W(2,5).\n2.  **Line 0:** Two zombies (R=28HP, N=24HP; total 52HP) will reach X(0,5) next turn. They deal 2 damage per turn. X(0,5) has 2HP and will die next turn. After X(0,5) falls, the zombies will attack J(0,4). J(10HP) can withstand their 2 damage for 5 turns. Losing the X(0,5) sunflower is acceptable as J(0,4) provides backup defense.\n3.  **Line 1:** One N(24HP) zombie approaches an empty column (1,5). Planting a Sunflower X(1,5) (50 sun) blocks the zombie for 2 turns (it has 2HP, zombie deals 1 dmg) and adds 10 sun\/turn income.\n4.  **Line 3:** One I(26HP) zombie approaches empty columns. Will reach J(3,3) in 3 turns. J(10HP) can withstand its 3 damage for 4 turns (10\/3 = 3.33 -> 4 turns). Needs offensive plant soon.\n5.  **Line 4:** Two R(28HP) zombies attack J(4,2). J(10HP) takes 2 damage per turn and will last 5 turns. An I(26HP) zombie is also approaching from the right. Needs offensive plant soon.\n\nAction: Use Fire Chili on Row 2 to clear the high threat (60HP).

W 0 1 attacks R. I at (0,5) will move to (0,4). Need defense for the incoming I.\n2.  **Line 1:** Safe, generating sun.\n3.  **Line 2:** H 2 5 (2 HP) is attacked by R+I at (2,5) (4 damage\/turn) and will die this turn. W 2 4 is buffed by H 2 5 and attacks R at (2,5). W 2 2 attacks B at (2,4). B attacks J 2 3 (10 HP). Next turn, R+I will move to (2,4) and attack W 2 4 (2 HP), destroying it. The combined R+I+B group will then overwhelm J 2 3 and W 2 2. This line needs immediate attention, ideally a Fire Chili (F, 300 sun). We don't have enough sun this turn (275), but will have 400 next turn (275 + 125). We must save sun for F next turn.\n4.  **Line 3:** J 3 1 (10 HP) is attacked by I at (3,2) (3 damage\/turn). R+N at (3,5) will move to (3,4). Need defense for the incoming R+N.\n5.  **Line 4:** Safe.\n\nStrategy:\nSpend minimally this turn to save 300+ sun for Fire Chili (F) on Line 2 next turn. We have 275 sun and will gain 125, reaching 400 next turn. We can spend up to 100 sun this turn and still afford F.\nPlanting Wall-nuts (J, 50 sun) defensively seems best.\n- Plant J at (0, 4) to block the incoming High-Attack Zombie (I) in Line 0.

The zombie in Line 4 needs to be dealt with. It will reach column 2 next turn.\n2.  Placing a Wall-nut (J) at (4, 2) will block the zombie. Cost: 50 sun. This leaves 135 - 50 = 85 sun. At the start of turn 10, sun will be 85 + 65 = 150. The Wall-nut (10 HP) can withstand the Normal Zombie (1 damage\/turn) for 10 turns.\n3.  Placing a Peashooter (W) in row 4 costs 100 sun. If placed at (4, 0) or (4, 1), it can start attacking the zombie. However, a lone Peashooter (2 HP) will be destroyed by the Normal Zombie before killing it.\n4.  Planting another Sunflower (X) costs 50 sun. This increases income but doesn't address the immediate threat.\n5.  Turn 10 will see increased zombie spawn rate and HP. Having a defense in place and sufficient sun (150) is crucial.\n\nDecision: Plant a Wall-nut in row 4 to block the incoming zombie. This is the most cost-effective immediate defense and preserves sun for the next turn.\n\nAction: Plant J at (4, 2).\n```\nAnswer: J 4 2","Answer: X 4 0;W 4 1","```\nAnswer: X 1 1\n```","```\nAnswer: W 3 1\n```","Answer: J 3 2","```\nAnswer: X 0 1\n```","```\nTurn:15 | Sun:175 | Score: 15\n\nCurrent Battlefield (X: Sunflower, W: Peashooter, S: Three-Line Shooter, J: Wall-nut, H: Torch Stump, F: Fire Chili, N: Zombie, R: Roadblock Zombie,B: Bucket Zombie,I: High-Attack Zombie)\nLine0|X  |X  |0  |0  |0  |0  |0  \nLine1|X  |X  |0  |0  |0  |0  |0  \nLine2|X  |W  |J  |0  |0  |0  |0  \nLine3|X  |W  |JRN|0  |0  |0  |0  \nLine4|X  |W  |J  |0  |0  |0  |0  \n```\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Sun:** 175. Next turn gain: 25 (base) + 5 * 10 (Sunflowers) = 75. Total next turn: 175 + 75 = 250.\n2.  **Threats:** Line 3 has a Wall-nut (10 HP) being attacked by a Regular Zombie (N, 4 HP) and a Roadblock Zombie (R, 8 HP + 4 HP buff = 12 HP). Total zombie HP = 16. Total damage to Wall-nut = 1 + 1 = 2 per turn. The Wall-nut will last 10 \/ 2 = 5 turns.\n3.  **Offense:** The Peashooter (W) on Line 3 deals 1 damage per turn. It will take 16 turns to defeat both zombies, which is too long; the Wall-nut will fall.\n4.  **Turn:** Turn 15 is a zombie spawn turn. 2 zombies will spawn (1 base + 1 bonus for turn > 10) with +4 HP.\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe most critical issue is the imminent destruction of the Wall-nut on Line 3. We need to increase the damage output on that line immediately. Planting another Peashooter behind the existing one is the most cost-effective way to double the damage.\n\n**Action:**\nPlant a Peashooter (W) in Row 3, Column 0. This will replace the Sunflower currently there.\n- Cost: 100 sun.\n- Remaining Sun: 175 - 100 = 75.\n- Effect: Damage on Line 3 increases from 1 to 2 per turn. The zombies (16 HP total) will now take 16 \/ 2 = 8 turns to defeat. The Wall-nut (10 HP) takes 2 damage per turn and lasts 5 turns. The zombies will still destroy the Wall-nut before they are killed, but it buys significant time and prevents them from reaching the Peashooters immediately. The Sunflower at (3,0) is sacrificed, reducing sun income by 10 per turn.\n\nAnswer: W 3 0","```\nAnswer: J 0 2;J 3 3\n```","Answer: W 0 3;X 1 2","```\nAnswer: J 0 3;X 1 3\n```","```\nAnswer: W 0 4;W 3 5\n```","Answer: W 0 5;W 3 4","Answer: W 2 3","```\nAnswer: J 2 4\n```","```\nAnswer: J 3 0; J 2 3; X 4 3\n```","```markdown\nAnswer: W 3 1;W 1 4\n```","```\nAnswer: W 2 5;X 1 5\n```","Answer: J 3 2;W 1 5","```\nAnswer: J 1 4;J 3 4;H 2 4\n```","```\nTurn:28\nSun:350\nScore: 28\nLine0|X(2)|X(2)|J(10)|0   |W(2)|W(2)|0\nLine1|X(2)|X(2)|X(2)|X(2)|W(2)|NN(4,4)|0\nLine2|X(2)|W(2)|J(10)|W(2)|BR(12,8)|WN(2,4)|0  (Assuming WN is NN(2,4))\nLine3|X(2)|W(2)|J(10)|J(10)|JB(10,12)|0  |0 (Assuming JB is NB(10,12))\nLine4|X(2)|W(2)|J(10)|X(2)|0   |0   |0\n\n**Turn 28 Simulation:**\n\n1.  **Sun Collection**: 350 + 25 (base) + 10 * 10 (Sunflowers) = 475 sun.\n2.  **Plant Actions**:\n    *   L0: W(0,4) hits nothing.

It's attacking the Sunflower X(4,3) which has only 2 HP. The Sunflower will be destroyed this turn. The zombie will then move to (4,3) next turn and attack the Wall-nut J(4,2) the turn after. The Peashooter W(4,1) deals only 1 damage per turn. This is the most immediate threat.\n2.  **Line 3:** The Bucket Zombie (B) at (3,4) has 12+12=24 HP. It's attacking the Wall-nut J(3,4) which has 10 HP. The Peashooter W(3,1) deals 1 damage per turn. The Wall-nut will fall in 10 turns, while the zombie will take 24 turns to kill. The zombie will destroy J(3,4) and then J(3,3). This needs more damage.\n3.  **Line 2:** The Roadblock Zombie (R) at (2,2) has 8+12=20 HP and the Normal Zombie (N) has 4+12=16 HP. They are attacking the Wall-nut J(2,2) which has 10 HP. The Peashooters W(2,1) and W(2,4) deal a combined 2 damage per turn to the first zombie (R). The Wall-nut takes 1+1=2 damage per turn and will fall in 5 turns. The R zombie will take 10 turns to kill. The Wall-nut will fall first. This line also needs attention soon.\n4.  **Line 1:** This line has no defense and is vulnerable to newly spawned zombies next turn.\n5.  **Sun:** Currently 300. Will gain 105 next turn.\n\n**Options:**\n\n*   **Fire Chili (F) on Line 4 (Cost 300):** This immediately eliminates the dangerous High-Attack Zombie, saving the Wall-nut J(4,2). This uses all the sun.\n*   **Peashooters (W) (Cost 100 each):** Could add Peashooters to lines 2, 3, and potentially 1 or 4. Planting three Peashooters (e.g., W 2 5, W 3 5, W 1 4) would cost 300 sun and bolster defenses but wouldn't solve the immediate threat on line 4 quickly enough.\n*   **Wall-nuts (J) (Cost 50 each):** Could reinforce lines, but doesn't solve the damage deficit.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nThe High-Attack Zombie on Line 4 is the most critical threat due to its high damage and the low HP of the plant it's currently attacking (X 4 3). Using the Fire Chili (F) is the most decisive action to prevent a breakthrough.\n\n**Action:**\n\nPlant Fire Chili on Line 4.

The W at (2, 4) deals 1 damage (N has 19 HP left after W attack). The J at (2, 0) will take 1 damage, leaving 9 HP. It will fall in 9 turns. The N zombie needs 19 turns to be killed by the W.

Placing a J(1,2) will stall them.\n2.  **Row 2:** J(2,1) and J(2,4) are attacked by R+I (1+3=4 damage) and I+R (3+1=4 damage) respectively. They have 10 HP and will last 2 more turns.\n3.  **Row 4:** W(4,1) is attacked by I(4,2) (3 damage). W(4,1) has 2 HP and will fall this turn. I(4,2) will then advance to column 1 and attack X(4,0). N(4,4) is also advancing. This row is critical.\n4.  **Sun:** 380.\n\nStrategy:\n- Use Fire Chili (F) on Row 4 to eliminate the immediate threat (I@4,2, N@4,4) and save W(4,1). Cost: 300 sun.\n- Use the remaining sun to place a Wall-nut (J) in Row 1 at column 2 to block the advancing zombies after J(1,3) falls. Cost: 50 sun.\n- Total cost: 300 + 50 = 350 sun. Remaining sun: 30.\n\nActions:\n- Place F at (4, 0).\n- Place J at (1, 2).\n\nAnswer: F 4 0;J 1 2\n```","```\nAnswer: J 4 1;F 1 2\n```","```markdown\n```markdown\nAnswer: J 4 0;S 1 2;H 3 0\n```","Answer: S 2 0;W 4 0","```\nAnswer: S 2 1;H 2 2;W 4 1;W 0 3\n```","```plantuml\n@startuml\nskinparam monochrome true\nskinparam ranksep 10\nskinparam dpi 300\nhide empty members\n\nclass Game {\n  Turn = 69\n  Sun = 195\n  Score = 69\n}\n\nclass Board {\n  +Plant[5][7]\n  +Zombie[5][7]\n}\n\nclass Plant {\n  Type\n  HP\n}\nclass Sunflower extends Plant {\n  Type = X\n  Cost = 50\n  HP = 2\n  SunGeneration = 10\n}\nclass Peashooter extends Plant {\n  Type = W\n  Cost = 100\n  HP = 2\n  Damage = 1\n}\nclass ThreeLineShooter extends Plant {\n  Type = S\n  Cost = 325\n  HP = 2\n  Damage = 1 (3 lines)\n}\nclass WallNut extends Plant {\n  Type = J\n  Cost = 50\n  HP = 10\n}\nclass TorchStump extends Plant {\n  Type = H\n  Cost = 125\n  HP = 2\n  DamageBuff = +1\n}\nclass FireChili extends Plant {\n  Type = F\n  Cost = 300\n  HP = N\/A (Instant)\n  Effect = Clears Row\n}\n\nclass Zombie {\n  Type\n  HP\n  Damage\n}\nclass RegularZombie extends Zombie {\n  Type = N\n  BaseHP = 4\n  Damage = 1\n}\nclass RoadblockZombie extends Zombie {\n  Type = R\n  BaseHP = 8\n  Damage = 1\n}\nclass BucketZombie extends Zombie {\n  Type = B\n  BaseHP = 12\n  Damage = 1\n}\nclass HighAttackZombie extends Zombie {\n  Type = I\n  BaseHP = 6\n  Damage = 3\n}\n\nnote \"Current HP Bonus: +24 (Turn > 60)\" as HPBonus\nnote \"N: 28, R: 32, B: 36, I: 30\" as CurrentHP\n\n' --- Board State ---\n' Line0|X  |X  |X  |WBN|0  |0  |0\n' Line1|X  |RNRI|0  |I  |0  |0  |0\n' Line2|JRI|S  |H  |JIRRN|0  |0  |0\n' Line3|X  |W  |J  |J  |0  |0  |0\n' Line4|XN |I  |0  |RI |0  |0  |0\n\n' --- Threat Analysis ---\n' Row 0: W(0,3)[2HP] vs B[36HP], N[28HP].

The game is played on a 5×7 board, where zombies spawn from the far right side and move one step to the left each turn. The types of plants and zombies are as follows:\n\nPlants  \n- Sunflower (X): Costs 50 sun, has 2 HP, and generates an extra 10 sun each turn.  \n- Peashooter (W): Costs 100 sun, has 2 HP, and deals 1 damage each turn to the first zombie in its current row.  \n- Three-Line Shooter (S): Costs 325 sun, has 2 HP, and deals 1 damage each turn to the first zombie in its current row as well as the first zombie in each of the adjacent rows.  \n- Wall-nut (J): Costs 50 sun and has 10 HP.  \n- Torch Stump (H): Costs 125 sun, has 2 HP; it increases the damage of the plant to its left in the same row (applied directly to the plant rather than to a projectile) by +1, and this effect can only be applied once.  \n- Fire Chili (F): Costs 300 sun and eliminates all zombies in its row.\n\nZombies  \n- Regular Zombie (N): Has 4 HP and deals 1 damage each turn to the plant that blocks its path.  \n- Roadblock Zombie (R): Has 8 HP and deals 1 damage each turn to the plant that blocks its path.  \n- Bucket Zombie (B): Has 12 HP and deals 1 damage each turn to the plant that blocks its path.  \n- High-Attack Zombie (I): Has 6 HP and deals 3 damage each turn to the plant that blocks its path.\n\nRules  \n- At least 25 sun is gained each turn.\n- A new zombie is spawned every 5 turns.\n- After every 10 turns, newly spawned zombies have their HP increased by 4, and the number of zombies spawned increases by 1.\n- Your score increases by 1 each turn.\n- The game lasts for a maximum of 100 turns.\n- Plants cannot be placed on the same grid cell, but zombies can coexist in the same cell.\n- There are no lawn mowers.\n- Roadblock Zombies only spawn after turn 10, and Bucket Zombies and High-Attack Zombies only spawn after turn 20.\n\nPlease input in the format \"PlantType Row Column\".

Analyze the Battlefield State:**\n\n*   **Turn:** 27\n*   **Sun:** 600\n*   **Zombie Threat Level:** High. Zombies have +8 HP due to turn > 20. Next spawn is Turn 30 (3 zombies with +8 HP).\n*   **Line 0:** X W X W | 0 | N(12HP) | 0. W(0,1) + W(0,3) deal 2 damage\/turn. N needs 6 turns to kill. N reaches W(0,3) in 2 turns. W(0,3) has 2 HP, N deals 1 damage. W(0,3) survives. N will die. **Status: Stable for now.**\n*   **Line 1:** X X W W X X | 0. No zombies. **Status: Safe.**\n*   **Line 2:** X X W J(10HP) W | B(20HP) | 0. W(2,2) + W(2,4) deal 2 damage\/turn. B needs 10 turns to kill. B reaches W(2,4) in 1 turn. W(2,4) has 2 HP, B deals 1 damage. W(2,4) survives 2 turns. B reaches J(2,3) in 2 turns. J(2,3) has 10 HP, B deals 1 damage. J survives 10 turns. B will die before breaking through J. **Status: Stable.**\n*   **Line 3:** X W J(10HP)BN(12HP+20HP) W H | 0 | 0. Zombies B+N are at (3,2) attacking J(3,2). J takes 1 (B) + 1 (N) = 2 damage\/turn. J survives 10\/2 = 5 turns. W(3,1) attacks B (1 damage). W(3,3) is buffed by H(3,4) and attacks B (1+1=2 damage). Total damage to B: 1+2 = 3\/turn. B needs 20\/3 = 7 turns to kill. Once B is dead, N needs 12\/3 = 4 turns to kill. Total time to kill zombies = 7+4 = 11 turns. J dies in 5 turns. **Status: Critical! J will fall.**\n*   **Line 4:** X X W(2HP) | I(14HP) | 0 | R(16HP) | 0. W(4,2) attacks I(4,3) (1 damage\/turn). I needs 14 turns to kill. I(4,3) attacks W(4,2) (3 damage\/turn). W(4,2) has 2 HP. W(4,2) will be destroyed *next turn*. R(4,5) is advancing. **Status: Critical! W will fall, exposing sunflowers.**\n\n**2. Identify Priorities:**\n\n1.  **Line 4:** Prevent I(4,3) from destroying W(4,2) and reaching sunflowers. Needs immediate action.\n2.  **Line 3:** Prevent B+N(3,2) from destroying J(3,2). Needs action within 5 turns.\n\n**3. Evaluate Options and Costs:**\n\n*   **Sun:** 600 available.\n*   **Line 4 Solutions:**\n    *   Plant J(4,2) (Cost 50): Buys 10\/3 ≈ 4 turns. W(4,2) still dies next turn. I then attacks J. Not a full solution.\n    *   Plant W(4,1) or W(4,0) (Cost 100): Adds 1 damage. I needs 14\/2=7 turns. W(4,2) still dies next turn. Not enough.\n    *   Plant F(4,x) (Cost 300): Instantly clears Line 4 (I and R). **Best immediate solution.**\n*   **Line 3 Solutions (assuming F used on Line 4, 300 sun left):**\n    *   Plant W(3,0) (Cost 100): Adds 1 damage. Total damage 4\/turn. B needs 20\/4=5 turns. N needs 12\/4=3 turns. Total 8 turns. J dies in 5 turns. B dies just as J falls. N then attacks W(3,1). Risky.\n    *   Plant J(3,1) (replace W) (Cost 50): Reduces damage, makes situation worse.\n    *   Plant H(3,2) (replace J) (Cost 125): J is crucial defense, cannot replace.\n    *   Plant S(3,0 or 3,1) (Cost 325): Not affordable after F on Line 4. Even if affordable, doesn't solve problem fast enough (as analyzed earlier).\n    *   Plant F(3,x) (Cost 300): Instantly clears Line 3 (B and N). **Best immediate solution.**\n\n**4. Formulate Plan:**\n\n*   The threats on Line 3 and Line 4 are immediate and severe. The zombie HP is high, and current damage output is insufficient, especially with the high-damage zombie on Line 4.\n*   Using Fire Chilies (F) on both lines is the most direct and effective way to neutralize the threats immediately, preventing breakthroughs and loss of plants\/progress.\n*   Place F in Line 4, column 1 (replacing X(4,1)). Cost 300. Sun remaining: 300.\n*   Place F in Line 3, column 0 (replacing X(3,0)). Cost 300. Sun remaining: 0.\n\n**5. Final Action:**\n\nPlant F at (4,1) and F at (3,0). This uses all 600 sun but secures the two most threatened lanes. Sacrifices two sunflowers, reducing income by 20 next turn, but prevents a likely game loss scenario.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Define Plant Costs\nplant_costs = {\n    'X': 50, 'W': 100, 'S': 325, 'J': 50, 'H': 125, 'F': 300\n}\n\n# Parse the input string\ninput_str = \"\"\"Turn:27 | Sun:600 | Score: 27\n\nCurrent Battlefield (X: Sunflower, W: Peashooter, S: Three-Line Shooter, J: Wall-nut, H: Torch Stump, F: Fire Chili, N: Zombie, R: Roadblock Zombie,B: Bucket Zombie,I: High-Attack Zombie)\nLine0|X  |W  |X  |W  |0  |N  |0  \nLine1|X  |X  |W  |W  |X  |X  |0  \nLine2|X  |X  |W  |J  |W  |B  |0  \nLine3|X  |W  |JBN|W  |H  |0  |0  \nLine4|X  |X  |W  |I  |0  |R  |0  \n\"\"\"\n\n# Extract sun\nsun_match = re.search(r\"Sun:(\\d+)\", input_str)\ncurrent_sun = int(sun_match.group(1)) if sun_match else 0\n\n# Proposed actions\nactions_str = \"F 4 1; F 3 0\"\nactions = actions_str.split(';')\n\n# Calculate cost\ntotal_cost = 0\nvalid_actions = []\nfor action in actions:\n    action = action.strip()\n    parts = action.split()\n    if len(parts) == 3:\n        plant_type, row_str, col_str = parts\n        if plant_type in plant_costs:\n            cost = plant_costs[plant_type]\n            if total_cost + cost <= current_sun:\n                total_cost += cost\n                valid_actions.append(action)\n            else:\n                print(f\"Action '{action}' skipped: Not enough sun.\")\n                # Optionally stop processing further actions if order matters and budget exceeded\n                break \n        else:\n            print(f\"Action '{action}' skipped: Unknown plant type '{plant_type}'.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Action '{action}' skipped: Invalid format.\")\n\n# Final decision based on validation (if any adjustments needed)\nfinal_action_str = \";\".join(valid_actions)\n\n# Check cost\nprint(f\"Current Sun: {current_sun}\")\nprint(f\"Proposed Actions: {actions_str}\")\nprint(f\"Validated Actions: {final_action_str}\")\nprint(f\"Total Cost: {total_cost}\") # Cost is 300 + 300 = 600\n\n# The plan is feasible and addresses the critical threats.\n```\n\n```\nAnswer: F 4 1;F 3 0\n```Answer: F 4 1;F 3 0","```markdown\nAnswer: F 4 2;F 3 1;J 0 3\n```","Answer: F 3 0;F 4 0","```\nAnswer: F 3 6; F 4 6; F 0 6; J 2 1\n```","Okay, let's analyze the situation and plan the defense.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Sun:** 240.

The X has only 2 HP and will be destroyed in 2 turns. The two Peashooters (W) deal 2 damage per turn, needing 8 turns to kill the N. Replacing the X with a Wall-nut (J) will save the lane temporarily.\n2.  **Line 2:** The Wall-nut (J) at (2, 3) is being attacked by a Bucket Zombie (B, 24 HP). The J has 10 HP and will last 10 turns. The Peashooter (W) deals 1 damage per turn, needing 24 turns to kill the B. The J will fall first. Meanwhile, a Roadblock Zombie (R, 20 HP) is at (2, 5) and will advance to (2, 4) next turn. Placing a Wall-nut at (2, 4) will block the R zombie.\n3.  **Line 0:** Wall-nut (J) at (0, 4) has 10 HP and is attacked by Bucket Zombie (B, 24 HP). Two Peashooters (W) deal 2 damage\/turn. J will last 10 turns, B needs 12 turns to be killed. J will fall first.\n4.  **Line 3:** Wall-nut (J) at (3, 5) has 10 HP and is attacked by Roadblock Zombie (R, 20 HP). The Peashooter (W) buffed by Torch Stump (H) deals 2 damage\/turn. Both J and R will last 10 turns. This line is temporarily stable.\n5.  **Sun:** 275. Sun generation is 135 per turn (assuming X at 1,5 survives this turn).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n*   Prioritize saving Line 1 by replacing the doomed Sunflower with a Wall-nut. This costs 50 sun but prevents the zombie from advancing immediately and buys time.\n*   Prepare for the Roadblock Zombie on Line 2 by placing a Wall-nut in its path. This costs 50 sun.\n*   Total cost: 50 + 50 = 100 sun. Remaining sun: 175.\n\n**Action:** Replace the Sunflower at (1, 5) with a Wall-nut and place another Wall-nut at (2, 4).\n\n```\nAnswer: J 1 5; J 2 4\n```","```\nAnswer: F 2 5\n```","```\nTurn:34 | Sun:195 | Score: 34\n\nCurrent Battlefield (X: Sunflower, W: Peashooter, S: Three-Line Shooter, J: Wall-nut, H: Torch Stump, F: Fire Chili, N: Zombie, R: Roadblock Zombie,B: Bucket Zombie,I: High-Attack Zombie)\nLine0|X  |W  |X  |W  |JB |0  |0  \nLine1|X  |X  |W  |W  |X  |N  |0  \nLine2|X  |X  |W  |J  |J  |0  |0  \nLine3|X  |0  |0  |W  |H  |JR |0  \nLine4|X  |X  |0  |0  |0  |0  |0\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Sun Calculation:** Current Sun: 195. Sun generated next turn: 25 (base) + 9 * 10 (Sunflowers) = 115. Sun at start of Turn 35: 195 + 115 = 310.\n2.  **Line 1 Threat:** The Sunflower (X) at (1,4) has 2 HP. The Regular Zombie (N) at (1,5) has 4 HP + 12 HP (bonus) = 16 HP. It will move to (1,4) and attack the Sunflower. The Peashooters W(1,2) and W(1,3) deal 1 damage each per turn. At the start of Turn 35, after plant attacks, the N zombie will have 16 - 1 - 1 = 14 HP. The zombie will attack the Sunflower, reducing its HP. Let's assume the sunflower survives this turn's attack (it has 2 HP, zombie deals 1 damage). Next turn (Turn 35 zombie phase), the zombie N(14HP) attacks X(1,4). The sunflower will be destroyed. The zombie will then target W(1,3) on Turn 36. This needs immediate attention.\n3.  **Line 0 Threat:** The Wall-nut J(0,4) is blocking a Bucket Zombie B (12 HP + 12 HP bonus = 24 HP) and possibly a Regular Zombie (hidden behind B). Assuming just B, it has high HP. The Peashooters W(0,1) and W(0,3) deal 1 damage each. Total damage = 2. At start of Turn 35, B HP will be 24 - 1 - 1 = 22 HP. The J(0,4) has 10 HP. The B zombie deals 1 damage per turn. The Wall-nut will last 10 turns, but the B zombie will take 22\/2 = 11 turns to kill. More damage is needed here.\n4.  **Line 3 Threat:** The Wall-nut J(3,5) is blocking a Roadblock Zombie R (8 HP + 12 HP bonus = 20 HP) and possibly a Regular Zombie. Assuming just R, the Peashooter W(3,3) is buffed by the Torch Stump H(3,4), dealing 1+1=2 damage. At start of Turn 35, R HP will be 20 - 2 = 18 HP. The J(3,5) has 10 HP. The R zombie deals 1 damage. The Wall-nut lasts 10 turns, R takes 18\/2 = 9 turns to kill. This line is relatively stable.\n5.  **Line 4:** Needs defense\/offense.\n6.  **Turn 35 Spawn:** 4 zombies will spawn.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  **Address Line 1:** The Sunflower at (1,4) is doomed. Replace it with a Wall-nut J(1,4) to block the N(14HP) zombie. Cost: 50 Sun.\n2.  **Boost Line 0 Damage:** The Bucket Zombie is tough. Planting a Torch Stump H(0,2) will buff the Peashooter W(0,1) to its left. Damage on Line 0 will increase from 1(W0,1)+1(W0,3)=2 to (1+1)(W0,1)+1(W0,3)=3. Cost: 125 Sun.\n3.  **Total Cost:** 50 + 125 = 175 Sun.\n4.  **Sun Remaining:** 310 - 175 = 135 Sun.\n\nThis plan defends the breach on Line 1 and significantly increases damage against the high-HP zombie on Line 0.\n\n**Action:** Plant Wall-nut at (1,4) and Torch Stump at (0,2).\n```\nAnswer: J 1 4;H 0 2\n```","```\nAnswer: W 0 5;J 4 5;W 4 3;X 3 1\n```","Answer: J 1 5;W 2 5","Answer: W 0 2","```markdown\nAnswer: J 0 3;J 1 3;W 2 1;X 4 2\n```","```\nAnswer: F 0 3;J 1 4\n```","Answer: F 0 3;X 3 2","```\nTurn:41 | Sun:530 | Score: 41\n\nThreat Analysis:\n1.  Line 0: BIN (B:28, I:22, N:20 HP) at (0,3) will destroy X at (0,2) this turn (5 damage vs 2 HP). This needs immediate attention or acceptance of the loss.\n2.  Line 4: IB (I:22, B:28 HP) at (4,6) -> (4,5) will attack J at (4,5). Damage is 4 (3 from I, 1 from B). J (10 HP) will last only 3 turns (10 -> 6 -> 2 -> destroyed).\n3.  Line 2: JNB (N:20, B:28 HP) at (2,4) attacks J at (2,4). Damage is 2. J (10 HP) will last 5 turns. Damage output (W at 2,2) is low (1 DPS).\n4.

Damage is 1. J (10 HP) lasts 10 turns. Damage output (W+H) is 2 DPS.\n\nStrategy:\nLosing the Sunflower (X) at (0,2) is acceptable as we have 9 others. Using a Fire Chili (F) on Line 0 (300 sun) would save it but leave Line 4 very vulnerable.\nA Three-Line Shooter (S) can cover multiple lanes. Placing S at (3,2) (325 sun) covers rows 2, 3, and 4, significantly increasing DPS where needed (especially Line 4).\nAfter placing S at (3,2), Sun = 530 - 325 = 205.\nThe X at (0,2) will be lost. The BIN zombies will then move to (0,2) and target W at (0,1). We need a defense there. Place J at (0,1) (50 sun). Sun = 205 - 50 = 155.\nLine 4's J at (4,5) is still falling fast. Place a backup J at (4,4) (50 sun). Sun = 155 - 50 = 105.\n\nPlan:\n1.  Plant S at (3,2) to boost damage on rows 2, 3, 4.\n2.  Plant J at (0,1) to defend after X at (0,2) falls.\n3.

A High-Attack Zombie (I, 26HP) is at (0,4) and will move to (0,3) next turn. The Peashooter (W) at (0,1) deals 1 damage per turn to B. Once I reaches (0,3), the Wall-nut will take 1 (B) + 3 (I) = 4 damage per turn and will fall in `ceil(10\/4) = 3` turns.

The Peashooter (W) at (2,2) deals 1 damage per turn to the first B. The Wall-nut takes 1+1=2 damage per turn and will fall in `10\/2 = 5` turns.\n4.  **Line 3:** A Roadblock Zombie (R, 28HP) at (3,2) is attacking the Sunflower (X, 2HP) at (3,1). This Sunflower will fall in `2\/1 = 2` turns. This is the most immediate threat. A Roadblock Zombie (R, 28HP) at (3,6) is attacking the Wall-nut (J, 10HP) at (3,5). This Wall-nut will last `10\/1 = 10` turns. There's no offensive plant on this row. The Torch Stump (H) at (3,4) is currently useless.\n5.  **Line 4:** A Bucket Zombie (B, 32HP) at (4,4) is attacking the Wall-nut (J, 10HP) at (4,4).

Placing a Wall-nut at (3,2) is the cheapest way (50 sun) to block it.\n2.  **Address Line 0:** J(0,3) will fall in 3 turns. Saving sun for a Fire Chili (F, 300 sun) seems like a good option, as it would instantly clear the B and I.\n3.  **Address Line 2:** J(2,5) will fall in 5 turns. Needs more damage or defense later.\n4.  **Address Line 3 (Damage):** Needs a Peashooter, ideally at (3,3) to benefit from H(3,4).\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  Plant a Wall-nut (J) at (3,2) to protect the Sunflower at (3,1). Cost: 50 sun. Sun left: 145 - 50 = 95.\n2.  Save the remaining sun (95). Next turn (Turn 54), sun will be 95 + 135 = 230. Turn 55, sun will be 230 + 135 = 365.

Saving sun is essential.\n8.  **Action Decision:** Doing nothing saves sun (240 + 135 = 375 next turn), allowing F(2,x) next turn. However, planting a Sunflower (X, 50 sun) is possible. Planting X(0,3) costs 50 sun (remaining 190). Next turn sun: 190 + (25 + 12*10) = 190 + 145 = 335. This is still sufficient to plant F(2,x) next turn (cost 300) while boosting long-term sun production.\n\nPlanting a Sunflower is a safe investment that doesn't hinder the immediate plan to use Fire Chili on Line 2 next turn.\n\nAnswer: X 0 3\n```","Answer: F 2 0","```\nTurn:62 | Sun:480 | Score: 62\n\nCurrent Battlefield (X: Sunflower, W: Peashooter, S: Three-Line Shooter, J: Wall-nut, H: Torch Stump, F: Fire Chili, N: Zombie, R: Roadblock Zombie,B: Bucket Zombie,I: High-Attack Zombie)\nLine0|X  |W  |X  |X  |J  |BR |0  \nLine1|X  |X  |W  |W  |J  |JN |0  \nLine2|X  |X  |W  |JBR|B  |0  |0  \nLine3|X  |X  |J  |W  |H  |JNRII|0  \nLine4|X  |X  |X  |WBB|0  |I  |0  \n\nAction Analysis:\n1.  **Line 4:** The Peashooter (W) at (4, 3) is being attacked by two Bucket Zombies (B) dealing 1+1=2 damage.

Sun: 270. Next zombie spawn: Turn 40 (4 zombies, HP +12).\n2.  **Row 0 Threat:** A stack of I (18HP, 3ATK), N (16HP, 1ATK), R (20HP, 1ATK) is at column 6. Total HP: 54. Total ATK: 5.\n    - Current Defense: W(2HP, 1ATK) at (0,4), J(10HP) at (0,5).\n    - Turn 39 Start: Zombies move to col 5. Attack J(0,5). J HP: 10 - 5 = 5.\n    - Turn 40 Start: Zombies attack J(0,5). J HP: 5 - 5 = 0. J destroyed. Zombies move to col 4.\n    - Turn 41 Start: Zombies attack W(0,4). W HP: 2. I deals 3 damage. W destroyed. Zombies move to col 3.\n    - Without intervention, the front defense collapses quickly, and the zombies will reach the sunflowers by Turn 42.\n    - Option 1: Fire Chili (F). Costs 300 sun. Not enough sun this turn (270). Need to survive until Turn 40 (Sun will be 270 + 115 + 115 = 500).\n    - Option 2: Stall. Plant J(0,3). Costs 50 sun. This Wall-nut will be attacked on Turn 42 after W(0,4) falls. It has 10 HP and faces 5 damage\/turn, lasting 2 turns (Turn 42, 43). This buys time to use Fire Chili on Turn 40. Plant J(0,3). Sun: 270 -> 220.\n3.  **Row 4 Threat:** B (12HP + 12 = 24HP, 1ATK) at column 4 attacks J(10HP) at column 3.\n    - Current Offense: W(4,1) boosted by H(4,2) deals 2 damage\/turn.\n    - Calculation: J(4,3) will last 10\/1 = 10 turns (until Turn 48 start). B(4,4) will last 24\/2 = 12 turns (dies Turn 50 start). J(4,3) will fall before B(4,4) is defeated.\n    - Option 1: Add damage. W at (4,0) is blocked by X. No other spot for W to add damage now.\n    - Option 2: Add defense. Plant J(4,2). Costs 50 sun. When J(4,3) falls (Turn 48), B(4,4) will have 24 - 2*10 = 4 HP left. B moves to column 3 and attacks J(4,2). J(4,2) takes 1 damage. On Turn 49, W+H deal 2 damage (B HP 4->2). On Turn 50, W+H deal 2 damage (B HP 2->0). B is defeated. J(4,2) survives. Plant J(4,2). Sun: 220 -> 170.\n4.  **Economy:** 9 Sunflowers generate 90 sun\/turn. Base sun is 25. Total 115 sun\/turn. With 170 sun remaining, consider adding another Sunflower.\n    - Option: Plant X(2,6). Costs 50 sun. Sun: 170 -> 120. Increases sun generation to 125\/turn.\n5.  **Plan:** Plant J(0,3) to stall Row 0, J(4,2) to reinforce Row 4, and X(2,6) to boost economy. Total cost: 50 + 50 + 50 = 150 sun. Remaining sun: 120. This setup allows for using Fire Chili on Row 0 on Turn 40.\n\n```\nAnswer: J 0 3;J 4 2;X 2 6\n```","Okay, let's analyze the situation at Turn 39.\nSun: 305.\nScore: 39.\n\nBoard State:\nLine 0: X(0,0) X(0,1) X(0,2) J(0,3) W(0,4) | N(<=16HP), R(<=20HP), I(<=18HP) at (0,5) | Empty (0,6)\nLine 1: X(1,0) X(1,1) W(1,2) W(1,3) W(1,4) | B(<=24HP) at (1,5) | Empty (1,6)\nLine 2: X(2,0) W(2,1) H(2,2) J(2,3) X(2,4) X(2,5) X(2,6) | No zombies\nLine 3: X(3,0) W(3,1) W(3,2) J(3,3) J(3,4) | No zombies | Empty (3,6)\nLine 4: X(4,0) W(4,1) H(4,2) | B(<=24HP) at (4,3) | Empty (4,4) Empty (4,5) Empty (4,6)\n\nDamage Output:\nLine 0: W(0,4) deals 1 damage to zombies at (0,5).\nLine 1: W(1,2)+W(1,3)+W(1,4) deal 3 damage to zombie at (1,5).\nLine 2: W(2,1) boosted by H(2,2) deals 2 damage (no target).\nLine 3: W(3,1)+W(3,2) deal 2 damage (no target).\nLine 4: W(4,1) boosted by H(4,2) deals 2 damage to zombie at (4,3).\n\nZombie Threat Analysis:\nLine 0: JINR stack (N+R+I) at (0,5). Total HP <= 54. Damage = 1+1+3=5\/turn. They move to (0,4) next turn. W(0,4) has 2 HP, will be destroyed instantly (end of T40). Then J(0,3) (10 HP) will be attacked (start of T41) and destroyed (end of T42). Zombies will reach the house around T47 without intervention.\nLine 1: B at (1,5). HP <= 24. Damage = 1\/turn. Moves to (1,4) next turn. W(1,4) has 2 HP, lasts 2 turns. Zombie takes 3 damage\/turn, dies in <=8 turns (around T47). Seems manageable for now, maybe reaches house around T50.\nLine 4: B at (4,3). HP <= 24. Damage = 1\/turn. Currently attacking H(4,2) (2 HP). H will die end of T40. Zombie takes 2 damage\/turn. Dies in <=12 turns (around T51).\nProgression Line 4:\nT39: B attacks H(4,2) [HP 2->1]. B takes 2 dmg.\nT40: B attacks H(4,2) [HP 1->0]. H dies. B takes 2 dmg. B moves to (4,2).\nT41: B attacks W(4,1) [HP 2->1]. B takes 1 dmg (H bonus lost).\nT42: B attacks W(4,1) [HP 1->0]. W dies. B takes 1 dmg. B moves to (4,1).\nT43: B attacks X(4,0) [HP 2->1]. B takes 0 dmg.\nT44: B attacks X(4,0) [HP 1->0]. X dies. B takes 0 dmg. B moves to (4,0).\nT45: B reaches the house. Game Over.\n\nConclusion: Line 4 is the most immediate threat, leading to game over by T45. Line 0 is also a major threat, leading to game over around T47. Line 1 seems less critical currently.\n\nOptions:\n1.  Use Fire Chili (F) on Line 4: Costs 300 sun. Remaining sun: 5. This saves Line 4 completely. However, Line 0 will still fail around T47. Need action on T40 for Line 0. Best follow-up action (J 0 4) delays Line 0 failure to T48.\n2.  Use Fire Chili (F) on Line 0: Costs 300 sun. Remaining sun: 5. This saves Line 0 completely. However, Line 4 will still fail at T45.\n3.  Use defensive plants (J) or offensive plants (W): Calculations show that placing affordable plants like J or W on threatened lines does not prevent game over on both lines; at best, it delays the inevitable slightly, e.g., to T46 or T47.\n\nStrategy: Prioritize survival time. Using F on Line 4 prevents the earliest game over (T45). Then, using the sun available on Turn 40 to place J(0,4) can delay the game over on Line 0 until T48. This seems the best option to maximize score\/survival.\n\nAction for Turn 39: Use Fire Chili on Line 4.\n\nAnswer: F 4 6","```\nTurn:40 | Sun:140 | Score: 40\n\nCurrent Battlefield (X: Sunflower, W: Peashooter, S: Three-Line Shooter, J: Wall-nut, H: Torch Stump, F: Fire Chili, N: Zombie, R: Roadblock Zombie,B: Bucket Zombie,I: High-Attack Zombie)\nLine0|X  |X  |X  |J  |W  |JINR|0\nLine1|X  |X  |W  |W  |W  |JB |0\nLine2|X  |W  |H  |J  |X  |X  |X\nLine3|X  |W  |W  |J  |J  |0  |0\nLine4|X  |W  |H  |J  |0  |0  |0\n\nSun Calculation for next turn (Turn 41):\nBase: 25\nSunflowers: (3+2+4+1+1) * 10 = 11 * 10 = 110\nTotal Sun Available for Turn 41 = 140 (Current) + 25 + 110 = 275\n\nZombie Analysis (Turn 40 -> 41):\n- Row 0: Zombies N(20HP), I(22HP), R(24HP) at (0,5).

W(0,4) will be destroyed. Zombies will then attack J(0,3) (10HP). Damage = 5. J(0,3) HP becomes 5.\n    - Row 1: Zombie B(25) at (1,4) will attack W(1,4) (2HP). W(1,4) will be destroyed. Zombie will then attack W(1,3) (2HP). Damage = 1. W(1,3) HP becomes 1.\n- Row 0 needs more defense or offense. The I zombie deals high damage.\n- Row 1 needs more offense to deal with the high HP Bucket Zombie.\n\nPlan:\n1.  Add defense in Row 0: Plant J at (0,2). Cost: 50 Sun. Sun Left: 275 - 50 = 225. This will block the zombies after J(0,3) falls.\n2.  Add offense in Row 1: Plant W at (1,0). Cost: 100 Sun. Sun Left: 225 - 100 = 125. This increases damage output against the Bucket Zombie.\n3.

J(3,4) has 10 HP and will last 4 turns. The two W's deal 2 damage\/turn. I(14HP) will take 7 turns to kill. J(3,4) will fall before the zombie is killed.\n4.  **Row 1:** Contains R(16HP) at column 5. It will attack J(1,5) next turn with 1 damage. J(1,5) has 10 HP and will last 10 turns. The three W's deal 3 damage\/turn. R(16HP) will take 6 turns to kill.

Row 0 and Row 3 threats remain but can be addressed next turn with 525 sun.\n*   **Fire Chili (F) in Row 0 (F 0 4):** Costs 300 sun. Eliminates I, N, R in Row 0. Saves W(0,4) and J(0,3). Leaves 80 sun. Row 4 threat remains: X(4,4) is destroyed next turn, J(4,3) faces 5 damage\/turn. This seems worse as Row 4 zombies are tougher and the W+H combo is valuable.\n*   **Three-Line Shooter (S):** Costs 325 sun. Placing it at (3,0) or (4,0) would add 1 damage to both Row 3 and Row 4, but the damage increase (from 2 to 3 in both rows) isn't enough to save the Wall-nuts in time.\n*   **Peashooters (W) \/ Wall-nuts (J):** Can add some damage or defense, but not enough with current sun to solve the immediate critical threats in Row 0 and Row 4 simultaneously.\n\nDecision:\nUsing Fire Chili in Row 4 is the best immediate action.

The Wall-nut has 10 HP, so it will last 10 \/ 4 = 2.5 turns, meaning it will fall at the end of Turn 65. This is the second most critical threat. Zombies (R, I) have 32 and 30 HP. Current offense (W+W = 2 damage\/turn) is slow.\n3.  **Line 0:** The Wall-nut (J) at (0,3) is attacked by two Bucket Zombies (B, B). Total damage is 1 + 1 = 2 per turn. It will last 10 \/ 2 = 5 turns (until the end of Turn 67). There is currently no offense in this row.\n4.  **Line 4:** The Wall-nut (J) at (4,4) is attacked by one Bucket Zombie and one Regular Zombie (B, N). Total damage is 1 + 1 = 2 per turn. It will last 10 \/ 2 = 5 turns (until the end of Turn 67). Current offense (assuming W at 4,1 and W at 4,2) is 2 damage\/turn.\n5.  **Line 2:** The Wall-nut (J) at (2,4) is attacked by one Regular Zombie (N). Damage is 1 per turn. It will last 10 turns. The boosted Peashooter (W+H) deals 2 damage per turn, which will handle the N zombie (28 HP) in 14 turns. This line is relatively stable.\n\n**Available Sun:** 315\n\n**Options & Strategy:**\n\n*   The immediate threat in Line 1 needs to be addressed quickly. The combined HP of the zombies is very high (30+32+28 = 90).\n*   Planting a Wall-nut (J, 50 sun) is only a temporary fix.\n*   Planting more Peashooters (W, 100 sun) won't kill the zombies fast enough before the Wall-nut falls.\n*   A Three-Line Shooter (S, 325 sun) is slightly too expensive.\n*   A Fire Chili (F, 300 sun) in Row 1 would instantly eliminate all zombies (I, R, N) in that row, solving the most critical problem. This seems like the most effective use of our current sun.\n\n**Decision:** Use the Fire Chili on Row 1. Planting it at (1,0) replaces a Sunflower but clears the immediate threat effectively.\n\n**Input:**\n\nAnswer: F 1 0","```\nAnswer: F 0 2;J 1 1;J 3 1;J 4 2\n```","```\nAnswer: F 0 3;W 3 4;J 1 4\n```","```\nAnswer: J 3 1; X 0 3\n```","Answer: J 3 2;J 4 0","Answer: F 1 1","```\nTurn:69 | Sun:115 | Score: 69\n\nCurrent Battlefield (X: Sunflower, W: Peashooter, S: Three-Line Shooter, J: Wall-nut, H: Torch Stump, F: Fire Chili, N: Zombie, R: Roadblock Zombie,B: Bucket Zombie,I: High-Attack Zombie)\nLine0|X  |X  |X  |X  |0  |0  |0\nLine1|X  |0  |0  |0  |J  |0  |0\nLine2|X  |W  |H  |J  |JNI|0  |0\nLine3|X  |W  |RI |NI |I  |0  |0\nLine4|B  |0  |J  |JBNBB|0  |0  |0\n\nAnalysis:\n1.  **Line 4:** A Bucket Zombie (B) is at position (4, 0).

Total 2 damage\/turn.\n\nTurn Analysis (Turn 13 -> Turn 14):\n1.  **Sun Calculation:** Start with 155 sun. Gain 25 (base) + 8 * 10 (Sunflowers) = 105 sun. Total sun available for spending: 155. Total sun at start of Turn 14 (if nothing spent): 155 + 105 = 260.\n2.  **Plant Actions:** W at (0,2) attacks R1. R1 HP: 8 -> 7.\n3.  **Zombie Movement:** R R at (0,4) are blocked by J at (0,4). No movement.\n4.  **Zombie Actions:** R1 and R2 at (0,4) attack J at (0,4). J HP: 10 -> 10 - (1+1) = 8.\n5.  **Zombie Spawning:** Turn 13 is not a multiple of 5. No new zombies.\n6.  **Score:** Score increases by 1. 13 -> 14.\n\nStrategic Considerations:\n- The Wall-nut (J) in row 0 is taking 2 damage per turn and will fall in 10 HP \/ 2 dmg\/turn = 5 turns.\n- The Peashooter (W) in row 0 deals 1 damage per turn. Total zombie HP in row 0 is 8 + 8 = 16. It would take 16 turns for the single Peashooter to defeat both zombies.\n- The Wall-nut will fall before the zombies are defeated if no action is taken.\n- Need to increase damage output in Row 0.\n\nOptions:\n1.  **Plant Peashooter (W) at (0,3):** Costs 100 sun. Remaining sun: 155 - 100 = 55. This adds another 1 damage per turn to row 0. Total damage becomes 2\/turn. Zombies (16 HP) will take 16 \/ 2 = 8 turns to kill. The Wall-nut survives for 5 turns. Still not ideal, but better. The first zombie (R1) will take (8 HP \/ 2 dmg\/turn) = 4 turns to kill. The second (R2) will take another 4 turns. The Wall-nut will survive the first zombie but fall during the fight with the second zombie. The Peashooters should be able to finish the second zombie before it reaches them.\n2.  **Plant Torch Stump (H) at (0,1):** Costs 125 sun. Remaining sun: 155 - 125 = 30. Replaces Sunflower at (0,1). Buffs W at (0,2) damage to 2\/turn. Sun generation decreases by 10. Same outcome as option 1 regarding damage (2\/turn) and zombie kill time (8 turns), but costs more sun and reduces future sun gain.\n3.  **Save Sun:** Save for a Three-Line Shooter (S) (325 sun) or Fire Chili (F) (300 sun). Need 2 more turns to afford S. By then (Turn 15), the Wall-nut HP will be 10 - 2*2 = 6 HP. Planting S at Turn 15 might work, but as analyzed in thought, the defense might crumble before S clears the threat.\n4.  **Plant Wall-nut (J) at (0,3):** Costs 50 sun. Remaining sun: 105. Provides defense for W at (0,2) but doesn't increase damage output. The front J will still fall in 5 turns. This doesn't solve the core issue of low damage.\n\nConclusion: Option 1 (Planting W at 0,3) is the most effective immediate action to bolster Row 0's offense and manage the current threat, while being affordable.\n\nAction: Plant Peashooter (W) at Row 0, Column 3.\n```\nAnswer: W 0 3","Answer: J 1 4;J 2 4;J 3 4","```\nAnswer: X 1 3\n```","Answer: W 2 3; J 4 3; X 3 2","```\nAnswer: J 4 2;W 2 2\n```","```text\nAnswer: W 3 3;W 3 2\n```","```markdown\n","```\nAnswer: F 4 0;J 0 3\n```","```\nAnswer: F 4 5;H 0 1;H 2 1\n```","```\nTurn:22 | Sun:410 | Score: 22\n\nCurrent Battlefield\nLine0|X  |X  |W  |R  |0  |R  |0\nLine1|X  |X  |X  |X  |J  |0  |0\nLine2|X  |X  |W  |W  |JR |N  |0\nLine3|X  |X  |X  |W  |J  |0  |0\nLine4|X  |J  |J  |0  |0  |0  |0\n\nSimulation of Turn 22 -> 23:\n1.  **Gain Sun**: Start Turn 23 with 410 + 25 (base) + 10 * 10 (sunflowers) = 535 Sun.\n2.  **Plants Attack**:\n    *   L0: W(0,2) attacks R(0,3).

Next turn gain: 25 (base) + 7 * 10 (sunflowers) = 95. Sun at T47: 305.\n2.  **Line 4 Threat:** High-Attack Zombie (I) at (4, 6) has 14 HP and deals 3 damage\/turn. It attacks Wall-nut J at (4, 5) (assuming J is at 4,5 based on common game logic). J has 10 HP. It will survive for 10\/3 = ~3 turns (T46 end: 7 HP, T47 end: 4 HP, T48 end: 1 HP, T49 end: destroyed). The Peashooter W at (4, 3) deals 1 damage\/turn to I (14 HP). The zombie will last 14 turns without intervention. This is the highest priority.\n3.  **Line 2 Threat:** Wall-nut J at (2, 4) is attacked by two Roadblock Zombies (R at 2,4 and R at 2,6), taking 2 damage\/turn. It has 10 HP and will last 5 turns (destroyed end of T50). The Peashooter W(2, 2) and Three-Line Shooter S(2, 3) attack the front R(2, 4) (16 HP), dealing 2 damage\/turn. R(2, 4) will last 8 turns. R(2, 6) is not currently damaged. This line needs attention soon, especially around T50 when the Wall-nut falls and zombies get stronger.\n4.  **Other Lines:** Line 0 (B vs W+H+S), Line 1 (R vs S+S), Line 3 (R vs W+S) seem relatively stable for the next few turns.\n\n**Strategy:**\n- The High-Attack Zombie in Line 4 needs immediate attention. A Fire Chili (F) costs 300 sun and would eliminate it instantly. We will have 305 sun next turn (T47). Waiting one turn to plant F is feasible as J(4, 5) will survive.\n- To slightly boost the economy without compromising the Fire Chili plan significantly, we can plant a Sunflower (X) this turn. Planting X costs 50 sun.\n- Best spot for X: Empty spots are (1, 3), (2, 0), (3, 3), (4, 0). Planting at (2, 0) would block a good spot for a future Peashooter in Line 2. Planting at (4, 0) would block a potential spot for the Fire Chili. (1, 3) and (3, 3) are good options. Let's choose (1, 3).\n\n**Plan:**\n- T46: Plant X at (1, 3). Sun: 210 - 50 = 160.

A better strategy is to save sun this turn.\n10. **Plan:** Accumulate sun. At the start of Turn 55, we will have 465 + 85 (T54 income) + 85 (T55 income) = 635 sun. This will be enough to replace J(0,4) (cost 50), J(3,4) (cost 50), and plant a new defender like J(2,3) (cost 50) after S(2,3) falls.\n\n**Action:**\nDo nothing this turn to save sun for crucial defenses next turn.\n\n```\nAnswer:\n```","操作格式错误，应为：植物类型 行 列","Answer: F 3 4; J 0 3","```\nAnswer: F 0 5;J 3 4\n```","```\nTurn:56 | Sun:160 | Score: 56\n\nCurrent Battlefield Analysis:\nLine 0: Safe. W+H ready. J healthy.\nLine 1: J(1,4) has 10 HP, attacked by R(28). HP will become 9. N(24) at (1,6) will move to (1,5). S(1,2) attacks R(1,4), R(2,4), R(3,6).\nLine 2: S(2,3) has 2 HP. R(2,4) has 28 HP. R(2,5) has 28 HP. R(2,4) attacks S(2,3) (S HP -> 1). W(2,2) attacks R(2,4). S(1,2) attacks R(2,4). S(2,3) attacks R(2,4). R(2,4) takes 3 damage (HP -> 25). R(2,5) moves to (2,4) and also attacks S(2,3) (S HP -> 0). **S(2,3) dies this turn.** Then, both R(28)s at (2,4) attack W(2,2). W(2,2) has 2 HP -> 0. **W(2,2) also dies this turn.** B(32) at (2,6) moves to (2,5). Next turn, J(2,1) will be attacked by two R(28)s moving to (2,3).\nLine 3: J(3,4) is healthy. R(28) at (3,6) moves to (3,5). W(3,3) attacks R(3,6). S(2,3) attacks R(3,6). R HP -> 26.\nLine 4: J(4,5) has 10 HP. RNB(28,24,32) at (4,6) move to (4,5) and attack J(4,5). J HP -> 7. W(4,3) attacks R(4,6). R HP -> 27.\n\nConclusions & Strategy:\n1.  Line 2 is collapsing. S(2,3) and W(2,2) will die this turn. J(2,1) will be attacked by two Roadblock Zombies next turn. The only viable solution is likely a Fire Chili (F), which costs 300 sun. I currently have 160 sun.\n2.  Saving Sun: I gain 105 sun per turn (25 base + 8*10 from Sunflowers).\n    - End of Turn 56: 160 sun.\n    - End of Turn 57: 160 + 105 = 265 sun.\n    - End of Turn 58: 265 + 105 = 370 sun. I can afford Fire Chili (300 sun) on Turn 58 to clear Line 2.\n3.  Immediate Threats Elsewhere:\n    - Line 1: J(1,4) takes 1 damage (HP 9). N(24) moves to (1,5). Next turn, J(1,4) will be attacked by R(27)+N(24) (2 damage). Planting a Wall-nut J at (1,5) (Cost 50) would block the N(24) and protect J(1,4).\n    - Line 4: J(4,5) takes 3 damage (HP 7). RNB will move to (4,4) next turn and attack J(4,4).\n4.  Decision: Save sun for Fire Chili on Turn 58. Use some spare sun for immediate defense if possible without compromising the Fire Chili plan. Planting J at (1,5) costs 50 sun, leaving 110. This still allows reaching 320 sun by Turn 58 (110 + 105 + 105 = 320). This protects Line 1 while saving for Line 2.\n\nAction: Plant a Wall-nut in Line 1, Column 5.\n\n```Answer: J 1 5","```\nTurn:57 | Sun:225 | Score: 57\n\nAnalyze Battlefield State:\n- Sun Calculation: Base 25 + 9 Sunflowers * 10 = 25 + 90 = 115 sun per turn.

Then J(4,4) is hit. Less critical than Row 2.\n\nThreat Assessment:\n- Row 2 is the most urgent threat. At the end of T58, W(2,2) will be destroyed by the two R zombies. The R zombies will then attack J(2,1) (10 HP). J(2,1) takes 2 dmg\/turn from the Rs. At the start of T60, the B zombie will reach (2,2) and J(2,1) will take 3 dmg\/turn. J(2,1) will fall around T62, and the zombies will reach the house at T63.\n- Row 4: J(4,5) falls end of T59. J(4,4) falls around T63. House breached much later (~T73).\n- Row 1: Needs attention within ~9 turns.\n\nStrategy:\nSun at start of T58: 340.\nRow 2 needs immediate intervention. The best solution is to eliminate the threat entirely.\n- Option 1: Plant Fire Chili (F) in Row 2. Cost 300. Sun remaining 40. This eliminates R(2,2), R(2,2), and B(2,4). Row 2 becomes safe, W(2,2) survives. This is the cleanest solution.\n- Option 2: Plant defenders\/attackers. Not enough impact for the cost compared to the overwhelming force. S(0,2) costs 325, helps damage but W(2,2) still falls quickly.\n- Option 3: Plant Fire Chili (F) in Row 4. Cost 300. Sun remaining 40. Clears Row 4, but leaves Row 2 critical, leading to faster breach.\n\nDecision: Use Fire Chili on Row 2.\n\nAction: Plant F at Row 2, Column 6 (any column works).\n\n```\nAnswer: F 2 6\n```","```\nAnswer: F 2 5\n```","```\nAnswer: J 4 1;X 2 3\n```","Okay, let's analyze the situation and plan the defense.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Sun:** 230 available. Will gain 25 (base) + 10 * 10 (Sunflowers) = 125 sun next turn. Total next turn: 230 + 125 = 355.\n2.  **Turn:** 60. This is a zombie spawn turn. 7 zombies (+24 HP each) will spawn at column 6.\n3.  **Threats:**\n    *   **Line 1:** J(1,5) (10 HP) is attacked by N(1,5) (24 HP). J lasts 10 turns. S(1,2) deals 1 damage\/turn to N(1,5). N lasts 24 turns.\n    *   **Line 3:** J(3,4) (10 HP) is attacked by R(3,4) (28 HP). J lasts 10 turns. W(3,2)+W(3,3) deal 2 damage\/turn to R(3,4). R lasts 14 turns.\n    *   **Line 4:** J(4,4) (10 HP) is attacked by B(4,4) (32 HP). J lasts 10 turns. W(4,3) deals 1 damage\/turn to B(4,4). B lasts 32 turns. Critically, R(28 HP) and N(24 HP) are right behind at (4,5). This line is under the most pressure.\n4.  **Priorities:** Line 4 needs immediate attention. The Bucket Zombie takes far too long to kill with current damage output, and the Wall-nut will fall long before it's defeated, letting the B, R, and N advance.\n\n**Options:**\n\n1.  **Do Nothing (Save for Fire Chili):** Save sun for F(4,x) next turn (cost 300). Next turn sun would be 355. This clears line 4 effectively but leaves J(4,4) with low HP and spends most of the sun right before new zombies arrive.\n2.  **Replace Wall-nuts:** Replace J(1,5), J(3,4), J(4,4) (Cost 150). Resets the 10-turn timer on defenses but doesn't solve the slow kill rate on Line 4. Leaves 80 sun.\n3.  **Add Damage (e.g., W 4 2):** Cost 100. Improves Line 4 damage slightly (B takes 16 turns), but J(4,4) still falls in 10 turns. Not enough.\n4.  **Replace J(4,4) now, Fire Chili next turn:** Replace J(4,4) with a new J(4,4) (Cost 50). Sun: 230 - 50 = 180. This resets the 10-turn timer for the most critical defense. Next turn (Turn 61), Sun: 180 + 125 = 305. Use Fire Chili F(4,0) (Cost 300). Sun: 305 - 300 = 5. This clears the dangerous Line 4 stack (B, R, N) while the replaced J(4,4) is still healthy (9 HP).\n\n**Decision:**\n\nOption 4 seems best. It reinforces the critical Line 4 defense immediately and sets up for a decisive Fire Chili next turn to eliminate the stacked threat before the new wave arrives. Replacing the Wall-nut now ensures it survives until the Fire Chili can be deployed. Assuming planting on an existing plant replaces it.\n\n**Action:** Replace the Wall-nut on Line 4.\n\nAnswer: J 4 4","Answer: J 2 4;F 4 0","```\nAnswer: F 2 4;W 1 1\n```","Answer: F 4 3;J 2 4","```markdown\nAnswer: F 2 5;J 2 4;H 4 4;H 3 5","```\nAnswer: W 0 5; W 2 5\n```","Answer: J 1 3;W 4 4","```\nAnswer: W 3 1;J 4 3\n```","```\nAnswer: J 1 1;W 4 1;J 3 2\n```","Answer: F 1 0","```\nAnswer: F 1 3;J 3 3;W 4 4\n```","```\nAnswer: J 4 3;W 1 1\n```","Answer: J 4 0;J 3 0","```\nTurn:73 | Sun:255 | Score: 73\n\nCurrent Battlefield (X: Sunflower, W: Peashooter, S: Three-Line Shooter, J: Wall-nut, H: Torch Stump, F: Fire Chili, N: Zombie, R: Roadblock Zombie,B: Bucket Zombie,I: High-Attack Zombie)\nLine0|X  |X  |W  |H  |J  |WB |0\nLine1|X  |W  |0  |0  |NBB|0  |0\nLine2|X  |J  |WN |I  |0  |0  |0\nLine3|XNI|0  |0  |JI |IRRR|0  |0\nLine4|XRNBB|0  |0  |JRN|W  |0  |0\n\nAnalysis:\n- Line 0: J(0,4) is holding against B(0,5), supported by W(0,2)+H(0,3).

Need an attacker here eventually.\n-   **Next Spawn:** Turn 10 (2 zombies with base HP + 4).\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Income:** Need more sun for stronger plants later. Planting another Sunflower is a good investment.\n2.  **Defense:**\n    -   Line 1: Peashooter handles the current zombie.\n    -   Line 2: Wall-nut is holding, but needs an offensive plant behind it.\n3.  **Available Sun:** 90. Enough for a Sunflower (50) or Wall-nut (50). Not enough for a Peashooter (100).\n\n**Decision:**\nPlanting another Sunflower increases future sun generation, which is crucial. Let's place it in row 0, column 1. This leaves 40 sun. Next turn, we'll have 40 + (6 * 10 + 25) = 40 + 85 = 125 sun, enough for a Peashooter or Torch Stump.\n\n**Action:**\nPlant Sunflower (X) at Row 0, Column 1.\n\nAnswer: X 0 1","```plant\nTurn: 9\nSun: 125\nScore: 9\n\nPlant Generation Phase:\nSunflowers: 6 (X at 0,0; 0,1; 1,0; 2,0; 3,0; 4,0)\nSun Generated: 6 * 10 + 25 = 85\nTotal Sun: 125 + 85 = 210\n\nPlant Action Phase:\nW(1,1) attacks N(1,3).

Will gain 25 (base) + 7*10 (Sunflowers) = 95 sun next turn. Total available for next turn planning: 160 + 95 = 255.\n2.  **Threats:** Zombies (N, likely 8HP due to turn > 10 buff) are attacking Wall-nuts (J) in rows 0 and 4. The Wall-nuts have 10HP each and will take 1 damage this turn (down to 9 HP). These rows lack attackers.\n3.  **Spawning:** Turn 15 is a spawn turn. 2 zombies (base HP + 4) will spawn at column 6.\n4.  **Objective:** Defend rows 0 and 4, possibly enhance economy or prepare for future waves.\n\nAction Plan:\n1.  **Defend Row 0:** Place a Peashooter (W) to attack the zombie. Column 3 is the closest available spot. Cost: 100 sun.\n2.  **Defend Row 4:** Place a Peashooter (W) to attack the zombie. Column 3 is the closest available spot. Cost: 100 sun.\n3.  **Economy:** With the remaining sun (160 - 100 - 100 = -40), I can't place both Peashooters this turn. I need to prioritize. Defending both rows is crucial.\n\nRevised Action Plan:\nI only have 160 sun. I can't place two Peashooters (200 sun).\nOption 1: Place one Peashooter (W) in row 0 (e.g., at 0,3). Cost 100. Sun left: 60. Place a Sunflower (X) in row 3 (e.g., at 3,2). Cost 50. Sun left: 10. This leaves row 4 undefended by a shooter.\nOption 2: Place one Peashooter (W) in row 4 (e.g., at 4,3). Cost 100. Sun left: 60. Place a Sunflower (X) in row 3 (e.g., at 3,2). Cost 50. Sun left: 10. This leaves row 0 undefended by a shooter.\nOption 3: Place two Wall-nuts (J) further forward in rows 0 and 4 (e.g., 0,3 and 4,3). Cost 50 * 2 = 100. Sun left: 60. Place a Sunflower (X) at 3,2. Cost 50. Sun left: 10. This buys time but doesn't add offense.\nOption 4: Place a Peashooter in one row (e.g., W 0 3, cost 100) and a Wall-nut in the other (e.g., J 4 3, cost 50). Total cost 150. Sun left: 10. This provides offense to one lane and defense to the other.\n\nOption 4 seems like the best compromise given the limited sun. Let's prioritize offense in row 0 and add defense in row 4.\n\nAction: Place Peashooter in Row 0, Column 3. Place Wall-nut in Row 4, Column 3.\nW 0 3 costs 100.\nJ 4 3 costs 50.\nTotal Cost: 150.

Reinforce Line 0 with W or J? Placing W at (0,1) (cost 100) doesn't help the W at (0,3). Placing J at (0,1) (cost 50) provides a fallback but doesn't solve the damage issue.\n4. Do nothing major on Line 0 and save sun?

Threat: R(3,4) attacks J(3,4) (assuming J exists there).\n- Row 4: B(36HP) at (4,4), N(28HP) at (4,6). Threat: B(4,4) attacks W(4,4) (1 dmg). W(4,4) has 2HP. N(4,6) moves to (4,5).\n\nSun: 905. Sun generation: 25 + 9*10 = 115\/turn.\n\nAnalysis:\n- Rows 0 and 1 face immediate, severe threats. The B+R combo in Row 0 will break through X(0,3) this turn. The N and double B combo in Row 1 will overwhelm X(1,2) and W(1,1) quickly.\n- Fire Chili (F) costs 300 sun and clears a row instantly. This is the most effective way to handle the dense threats in Row 0 and Row 1.\n- Using F in Row 0 removes B+R(0,3) and I(0,6), saving X(0,3).\n- Using F in Row 1 removes N(1,2), B+B(1,3), N(1,6), saving X(1,2) and W(1,1).\n- Row 4: W(4,4) will take 1 damage but survive this turn. B(4,4) will continue attacking it. N(4,6) will move to (4,5). Planting a Wall-nut (J) at (4,5) will block the N(4,5) next turn. W(4,4) might fall next turn, but B(4,4) will then target J(4,3).\n\nPlan:\n1. Plant Fire Chili in Row 0 (e.g., at 0,5) to clear all zombies. Cost: 300 Sun.\n2. Plant Fire Chili in Row 1 (e.g., at 1,5) to clear all zombies. Cost: 300 Sun.\n3. Plant Wall-nut in Row 4, Column 5 to block the incoming N zombie. Cost: 50 Sun.\n\nTotal Cost: 300 + 300 + 50 = 650 Sun.\nRemaining Sun: 905 - 650 = 255 Sun.\n\nAnswer: F 0 5; F 1 5; J 4 5\n```","```\nAnswer: F 1 5; X 0 4\n```","Answer: J 2 2;W 1 3","Answer:","Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide the best action.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Sun:** 325 sun available. Base sun gain next turn is 25. Sunflowers generate extra sun. I have Sunflowers at (0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1). That's 10 Sunflowers, generating 10 * 10 = 100 extra sun per turn. Total sun next turn will be 25 (base) + 100 (sunflowers) + 25 (remaining sun) = 150.\n2.  **Threats:**\n    *   **Row 3:** The RNR stack at (3,3) (Regular Zombie: 4+20=24HP, Roadblock Zombie: 8+20=28HP, Total=52HP) is attacking the Peashooter W at (3,2) (2HP). The zombies deal 1 (N) + 1 (R) = 2 damage. The Peashooter W at (3,2) will be destroyed this turn. The zombies will then advance to (3,2) and target the Peashooter W at (3,1) next turn. The Peashooter W at (3,2) deals 1 damage. The buffed Three-Line Shooter S at (2,3) (buffed by H at 2,2) deals 2 damage to the first zombie in row 3 (RNR). Total damage to RNR is 1+2=3 per turn. This is too slow for 52 HP. This is the most critical threat.\n    *   **Row 2:** The Bucket Zombie B at (2,4) (12+20=32HP) is attacking the Wall-nut J at (2,4) (10HP). B deals 1 damage\/turn, so J will last 10 turns. The buffed S at (2,3) deals 2 damage per turn to B. It will take 16 turns to kill the B. This is manageable for now, as the J provides a good buffer.\n3.  **Upcoming Spawn:** Turn 65 (next turn) is a spawn turn. 6 zombies (1 base + 5 bonus) will spawn with +20 HP.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe immediate priority is Row 3. The RNR stack has high HP and will break through quickly. Using a Fire Chili (F) is the most effective solution.\n\n*   **Option: Fire Chili (F)**\n    *   Cost: 300 sun.\n    *   Effect: Eliminates all zombies in the target row.\n    *   Placement: Plant F in Row 3. Placing it at (3,1) is an empty spot and will clear the RNR stack at (3,3).\n    *   Outcome: Row 3 threat neutralized. W(3,2) is still destroyed this turn before F acts (assuming F acts end of turn or plants act before zombies), but the zombies are removed before they can advance further or damage W(3,1). Remaining sun: 325 - 300 = 25.\n\nThis seems like the best move. It uses most of the sun but removes a very dangerous threat immediately. The situation in Row 2 is stable for several turns. Next turn, focus will be on rebuilding sun and managing the new wave of 6 zombies.\n\n**Decision:** Plant Fire Chili in Row 3.\n\nAnswer: F 3 1","Okay, let's analyze the situation and decide the best action.\n\n**Current State:**\n*   Turn: 65\n*   Sun: 450\n*   Score: 65\n*   Zombie Spawn Turn: Yes (Turn 65 \/ 5 = 13). 1 + floor(65\/10) = 1 + 6 = 7 zombies will spawn. HP increase = 4 * floor(65\/10) = +24 HP.\n*   Sun Generation: 25 (base) + 9 Sunflowers * 10 = 115 Sun\/turn.\n\n**Threats:**\n1.  **Row 2, Column 4:** A Bucket Zombie (B, 12 HP) and a Roadblock Zombie (R, 8 HP) are attacking the Wall-nut (J, 10 HP). They deal 1+1=2 damage per turn. The boosted Three-Line Shooter (S) at (2,3) deals 2 damage to the first zombie in this row. The Wall-nut will last (10 HP \/ 2 DMG\/turn) = 5 turns. However, the zombies will advance.\n    *   Turn 65: J HP: 10->8. B HP: 12->10, R HP: 8->6. Zombies stay at (2,4).\n    *   Turn 66: Zombies move to (2,3). Attack S (2 HP). J at (2,4) is gone. S takes 2 damage and dies. This is critical, need to protect the S shooter.\n2.  **Row 3, Column 2:** A Normal Zombie (N, 4 HP) and a Roadblock Zombie (R, 8 HP) are attacking the Peashooter (W, 2 HP). They deal 1+1=2 damage per turn. The Peashooter will be destroyed this turn. The combined damage from S (boosted, 2 DMG) and W at (3,1) (1 DMG) and W at (3,2) (1 DMG) is 4 DMG per turn to the first zombie.\n    *   Turn 65: W at (3,2) takes 2 DMG (dies). N takes 4 DMG (dies). R takes 4 DMG (HP 8->4).\n\n**Analysis:**\n*   The Peashooter at (3,2) is doomed. We need to replace it or put a defense there.\n*   The Three-Line Shooter (S) at (2,3) is threatened next turn. Protecting it is high priority as it covers three rows.\n\n**Options:**\n1.  **Fire Chili (F) on Row 2:** Costs 300 sun. Clears the B and R zombies instantly, saving J(2,4) and S(2,3). We also need to address Row 3. Plant Wall-nut (J) at (3,2) (Costs 50). Total cost 350. Sun left: 100.\n2.  **Defensive Planting:** Plant Wall-nut (J) at (3,2) to block the R zombie after W(3,2) falls (Costs 50). Plant another Wall-nut (J) at (2,5) to provide backup for J(2,4) (Costs 50). Total cost 100. Sun left: 350.\n    *   With this plan:\n        *   Row 3: W(3,2) dies. N dies. R(4HP) attacks J(3,2) next turn. R takes 3 DMG\/turn (S+W(3,1)) and dies in 2 turns. J(3,2) survives.\n        *   Row 2: J(2,4) survives for 4 more turns (HP: 8->6->4->2->0). B(12HP) and R(8HP) take 2 DMG\/turn. R dies in 4 turns. B survives. B reaches J(2,5) on turn 69.\n\n**Decision:**\nOption 2 is much cheaper, preserving sun for the upcoming wave of 7 stronger zombies. It handles both immediate threats adequately, although it doesn't eliminate the Row 2 threat instantly. Protecting the S shooter is key, and while J(2,4) will fall, the backup J(2,5) gives the S shooter time to wear down the zombies.\n\n**Action:**\nPlant Wall-nut at (3,2) and Wall-nut at (2,5).\n\nAnswer: J 3 2;J 2 5","```markdown\n","```\nAnswer: F 2 0; J 3 0; J 1 4; W 0 1; W 0 0\n```","```\nAnswer: F 3 1;W 2 0;W 0 0\n```","```\nAnswer: F 2 0;W 0 2;J 3 0\n```","```\nAnswer: F 2 3;W 0 4;W 1 5;W 4 5\n```","```\nAnswer: W 2 4;W 0 5;J 3 5\n```","```\nTurn:72 | Sun:135 | Score: 72\n\nCurrent Battlefield (X: Sunflower, W: Peashooter, S: Three-Line Shooter, J: Wall-nut, H: Torch Stump, F: Fire Chili, N: Zombie, R: Roadblock Zombie,B: Bucket Zombie,I: High-Attack Zombie)\nLine0|X  |X  |JRBR|0  |W  |WINR|0\nLine1|X  |W  |X  |W  |J  |INI|0\nLine2|X  |J  |0  |0  |W  |JB |0\nLine3|X  |0  |0  |0  |0  |J  |0\nLine4|X  |X  |J  |J  |W  |J  |RIN\n\nAnalysis:\n1.  **Line 0:** W(0,5) (2HP) is attacked by R+I+N (5 damage) and will be destroyed this turn.

It deals 1 damage\/turn to Wall-nut (J) at (3,4), which currently has 9 HP (took 1 damage last turn). The W at (3,2) deals 1 damage\/turn. The N will die in 3 turns. The J will take 3 more damage (total 4), leaving it with 6 HP. This line is relatively safe.\n    *   Line 4: Roadblock Zombie (R) at (4,3) has 8 HP left (was 8 HP, hit by W(4,1) this turn). It deals 1 damage\/turn to Wall-nut (J) at (4,3), which has 10 HP. The W at (4,1) deals 1 damage\/turn. The R will die in 8 turns. The J will take 8 damage, leaving it with 2 HP. This line is under more pressure due to the higher HP zombie.\n2.  **Turn 15:** A zombie spawn turn. 2 zombies will spawn (number increases by 1 every 10 turns). Their HP will be Base HP + 4 (HP increases by 4 after turn 10). Possible spawns: N (8 HP), R (12 HP).\n3.  **Sun Management:** Current sun is 120. Next turn generation: 6 Sunflowers * 10 + 25 (base) = 85 sun. Total next turn = 120 + 85 = 205 sun (before spending).\n4.  **Planting Options:**\n    *   **Peashooter (W)** at (4,2): Costs 100 sun. Sun left = 20. Doubles the damage on Line 4. The R zombie (8 HP) would take 2 damage\/turn (from W(4,1) + W(4,2)) and die in 4 turns. The J at (4,3) would only take 4 damage, leaving it with 6 HP. This significantly improves the situation on the most threatened lane.\n    *   **Sunflower (X)**: Costs 50 sun. Can plant two (e.g., at (0,2) and (2,2)) for 100 sun. Sun left = 20. Increases sun generation by 20\/turn. Good for long-term, but doesn't address the immediate threat on Line 4 as effectively.\n    *   **Wall-nut (J)**: Costs 50 sun. Can place one, e.g., J at (4,2) behind J(4,3). Sun left = 70. Provides backup defense but doesn't increase offense.\n    *   **Torch Stump (H)**: Costs 125 sun. Not affordable.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe R zombie on Line 4 poses the biggest immediate threat due to its high HP. Adding another Peashooter (W) on Line 4 provides the best immediate value by cutting the time needed to kill the R zombie in half and preserving the Wall-nut's health significantly. This seems more prudent than investing in Sunflowers right before a zombie spawn turn.\n\n**Action:** Plant a Peashooter on Line 4, Column 2.\n\n```Answer: W 4 2```","行和列必须为整数。","Answer: W 4 2;X 0 2;X 2 2","Answer: H 4 3","Answer: J 4 3;W 4 0;X 0 3","Answer: W 4 3;X 2 3","```text\nAnswer: F 4 0;X 1 0\n```","Answer: F 4 5;W 3 3","```\nAnswer: W 3 1;H 4 0\n```","Answer: S 3 1","Answer: F 3 4;H 4 3","Answer: F 3 4;J 3 4;H 4 3","```text\nAnswer: F 3 5;H 4 3\n```","```\nAnswer: F 2 0; F 4 0\n```","Answer: F 2 4;W 4 0;S 3 1","Answer: J 4 2;W 0 4;W 2 4","```\nTurn:29 | Sun:605 | Score: 29\n\nCurrent Battlefield (X: Sunflower, W: Peashooter, S: Three-Line Shooter, J: Wall-nut, H: Torch Stump, F: Fire Chili, N: Zombie, R: Roadblock Zombie,B: Bucket Zombie,I: High-Attack Zombie)\nLine0|X  |X  |X  |X  |W  |0  |0  \nLine1|X  |W  |W  |J  |0  |0  |0  \nLine2|X  |X  |X  |X  |W  |0  |0  \nLine3|X  |X  |W  |W  |J  |0  |0  \nLine4|X  |W  |W  |JI |0  |0  |0  \n\nAction Analysis:\n1.

The zombie has 6 base HP + 8 HP (level bonus) = 14 HP. It deals 3 damage per turn. The Wall-nut has 10 HP. The two Peashooters in row 4 deal 1+1=2 damage per turn. The zombie will take 14\/2 = 7 turns to kill. The Wall-nut will take 10\/3 = 3.33 turns to be destroyed. The Wall-nut will fall before the zombie is killed.\n3.  Strategy: Eliminate the High-Attack Zombie quickly using a Fire Chili (F) in row 4. This costs 300 sun and instantly removes the threat. Then, bolster the defenses in rows 0 and 2, which currently have low damage output (1 damage\/turn each), in preparation for the next wave of zombies (turn 30 will spawn 3 zombies with +12 HP). Adding a Peashooter (W) to each of these rows costs 100 sun each.\n4.  Proposed Actions:\n    *   Plant Fire Chili in row 4 (e.g., at column 5) to eliminate the zombie: F 4 5 (Cost: 300 Sun)\n    *   Plant Peashooter in row 0, column 3: W 0 3 (Cost: 100 Sun)\n    *   Plant Peashooter in row 2, column 3: W 2 3 (Cost: 100 Sun)\n5.  Total Cost: 300 + 100 + 100 = 500 sun.\n6.

Next turn generation: 25 (base) + 9 * 10 (Sunflowers) = 115 sun.\n2.  **Threats:**\n    *   **Line 2:** A Bucket Zombie (B) is attacking the Wall-nut (J) at (2,5). The Wall-nut has 10 HP and the B zombie deals 1 damage\/turn, so the Wall-nut will last 10 turns. The Peashooter (W) at (2,4) deals 1 damage\/turn to the B zombie. Assuming the B zombie spawned after turn 20 but before turn 30 (e.g., turn 25 or 30), its HP would be 12 + 8 = 20 HP. It will take 20 turns for the Peashooter alone to defeat it. The Wall-nut will fall before the zombie is defeated.\n    *   **Line 4:** A Roadblock Zombie (R) and a Bucket Zombie (B) are attacking the Wall-nut (J) at (4,3). The Wall-nut has 10 HP and takes 1 (R) + 1 (B) = 2 damage\/turn. It will only last 5 turns. The Peashooter (W) at (4,2) deals 1 damage\/turn to the first zombie (R). Assuming they spawned after turn 20 but before turn 30, R has 8 + 8 = 16 HP, and B has 12 + 8 = 20 HP. The R zombie will take 16 turns to defeat with the current setup. This Wall-nut is in imminent danger.\n3.  **Priorities:** Line 4 needs immediate attention as the Wall-nut will fall in 5 turns, potentially letting zombies reach the Peashooters. Line 2 is less urgent but still needs addressing soon.\n\n**Options:**\n1.  **Fire Chili (F) on Line 4:** Costs 300 sun. Instantly eliminates both the R and B zombies in Line 4. This completely solves the immediate threat. Remaining sun: 40.\n2.  **Reinforce Line 4 with Peashooters\/Torch Stump:**\n    *   Add W at (4,4): Costs 100 sun. Total damage to R becomes 2. R (16 HP) dies in 8 turns. J (10 HP) still falls in 5 turns. Not enough.\n    *   Add H at (4,1) (boosting W(4,1)): Costs 125 sun. Total damage to R becomes 1 (W(4,2)) + 2 (Boosted W(4,1)) = 3. R (16 HP) dies in ~6 turns. J (10 HP) still falls in 5 turns. Not enough.\n3.  **Three-Line Shooter (S) Strategy:** Placing S at (3,2) (replacing W) costs 325 sun. Hits Lines 2, 3, 4.\n    *   Line 4: Damage to R becomes 1 (W(4,1)) + 1 (S) = 2. Still not enough to save J(4,3).\n    *   Line 2: Damage to B becomes 1 (W(2,4)) + 1 (S) = 2. B (20 HP) dies in 10 turns. J(2,5) survives exactly 10 turns. This works for Line 2.\n    *   Cost is high (325), leaving only 15 sun.\n\n**Decision:**\nUsing the Fire Chili (F) on Line 4 is the most effective way to handle the critical situation there. Although costly (300 sun), it guarantees the line's safety for now. We will have 40 sun left, and 115 generated next turn (total 155), which is enough to reinforce Line 2 next turn (e.g., by adding a Torch Stump H at (2,3) replacing the Sunflower X for 125 sun to boost W(2,4)).\n\nLet's plant the Fire Chili. Since it affects the whole row, the column choice might not matter functionally, but we need to provide one. Let's place it at the back, replacing the Sunflower at (4,0) to minimize disruption to the firing line.\n\n**Action:** Plant Fire Chili in Row 4, Column 0.\n\nAnswer: F 4 0","```\nTurn:33 | Sun:485 | Score: 33\n\nCurrent Battlefield (X: Sunflower, W: Peashooter, S: Three-Line Shooter, J: Wall-nut, H: Torch Stump, F: Fire Chili, N: Zombie, R: Roadblock Zombie,B: Bucket Zombie,I: High-Attack Zombie)\nLine0|X  |X  |X  |X  |W  |J  |0\nLine1|X  |W  |W  |J  |0  |0  |0\nLine2|X  |X  |X  |X  |W  |J B |0\nLine3|X  |X  |W  |W  |J  |0  |0\nLine4|X  |W  |W  |J  |R B|0  |0\n\nAnalysis:\n1.  **Zombie HP:** At Turn 33, zombies spawned after Turn 31 have Base HP + 12. R = 20 HP, B = 24 HP.\n2.  **Threat Assessment (Row 4):** Zombies R and B are in column 5. The Wall-nut (J) is in column 4. The zombies will attack J 4,4. J 4,4 has 10 HP and takes 1 (R) + 1 (B) = 2 damage per turn. J 4,4 will be destroyed in 10 \/ 2 = 5 turns (i.e., at the end of Turn 38). The Peashooters W 4,1 and W 4,2 deal a total of 2 damage per turn to the first zombie (R) in column 5. R (20 HP) will be destroyed in 20 \/ 2 = 10 turns (i.e., at the end of Turn 43). Since J 4,4 falls at Turn 38, the zombies will break through and start attacking W 4,2 at Turn 39. This is the most immediate threat.\n3.  **Threat Assessment (Row 2):** Zombie B is in column 5, attacking J 2,5 (10 HP). J 2,5 takes 1 damage per turn and will be destroyed in 10 turns (at the end of Turn 43). The Peashooter W 2,4 attacks B 2,5 (24 HP). B 2,5 takes 1 damage per turn and will be destroyed in 24 turns (at the end of Turn 57). When J 2,5 falls at Turn 43, B 2,5 will move to column 4 at Turn 44 and attack W 2,4. This is a secondary threat compared to Row 4.\n4.  **Sun:** Current Sun = 485. Sun gain per turn = 25 (base) + 12 * 10 (Sunflowers) = 145.\n5.  **Available Planting Spots:** Row 0 (Col 6), Row 1 (Col 4, 5, 6), Row 2 (Col 6), Row 3 (Col 1, 5, 6), Row 4 (Col 3, 5, 6).\n\nStrategy:\n1.  **Address Row 4:** The imminent breach in Row 4 must be addressed. Increasing damage with Peashooters, Torch Stumps, or Three-Line Shooters is insufficient to kill the Roadblock Zombie before the Wall-nut falls. Adding another Wall-nut only delays the breach slightly. The most effective solution is to use a Fire Chili (F) which costs 300 sun and eliminates all zombies in the row. Planting F 4 3 (in the empty column 3) will instantly remove R and B from Row 4.\n2.  **Address Row 2:** After using F 4 3, 485 - 300 = 185 sun remains. This is not enough to plant a Three-Line Shooter (325 sun) which could add damage to Row 2 from an adjacent row (e.g., S 1 4). Planting additional defenses or attackers in Row 2 itself is impossible as the only empty spot is Column 6, behind the action. The best course is to save the remaining sun.\n3.  **Next Turn Plan:** Save the 185 sun. At the start of Turn 34, sun will be 185 + 145 = 330. This is enough to plant a Three-Line Shooter (S) in Turn 34 (e.g., S 1 4, cost 325) to increase damage in Row 2 and handle the Bucket Zombie before it breaks through significantly.\n\nAction for Turn 33:\nPlant Fire Chili in Row 4, Column 3 to eliminate the immediate threat.\n\n```\nAnswer: F 4 3\n```","```\nAnswer: S 3 2;J 4 4\n```","```markdown\nAnswer: S 3 2;W 4 0;W 2 3;X 1 0;X 3 0\n```","```\nTurn:36 | Sun:870 | Score: 36\n\nCurrent Battlefield (X: Sunflower, W: Peashooter, S: Three-Line Shooter, J: Wall-nut, H: Torch Stump, F: Fire Chili, N: Zombie, R: Roadblock Zombie,B: Bucket Zombie,I: High-Attack Zombie)\nLine0|X  |X  |X  |X  |W  |J  |0\nLine1|X  |W  |W  |J  |0  |0  |I\nLine2|X  |X  |X  |X  |W  |JB |R\nLine3|X  |X  |W  |W  |J  |0  |B\nLine4|X  |W  |WRB|0  |J  |0  |N\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

Current Peashooters (W+W) deal 2 damage\/turn. Kill time = 52\/2 = 26 turns. This row is also critical, as the Wall-nuts will fall before the zombies are defeated.\n3.  **Row 2:** J(10HP) vs B(28HP, 1 Dmg). Total Zombie HP = 28. Total Damage to J = 1\/turn. The J falls in 10\/1 = 10 turns. Current Peashooter (W) deals 1 damage\/turn. Kill time = 28\/1 = 28 turns. This row will also fall eventually.\n4.  **Row 0:** J(10HP) vs N(20HP, 1 Dmg).

This row will also fall eventually.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n*   Row 3 is the most immediate threat due to the High-Attack Zombie and the fast-falling Wall-nut. A Fire Chili (F) is the most effective way to neutralize this threat instantly.\n*   Row 1 is the next major threat with high combined HP and insufficient damage\/defense. We need to significantly boost damage here. Adding a Peashooter (W) and a Torch Stump (H) seems necessary. The Torch Stump (H) at (1, 3) will buff the Peashooter at (1, 2), doubling its damage.\n*   Row 0 needs attention as the Wall-nut will fall before the zombie is killed. Adding another Peashooter will match the kill time to the Wall-nut's lifespan.\n*   Row 2 is problematic, but we may not have enough sun to save all rows this turn.\n\n**Proposed Actions & Costs:**\n\n1.  **F 3 0:** Use Fire Chili in Row 3 to eliminate the I and R zombies immediately.

Row 0 damage becomes W(0,3) + W(0,4) = 1 + 1 = 2\/turn. (Cost: 100 sun, Remaining: 140 - 100 = 40 sun)\n\n**Outcome of Plan:**\n\n*   **Row 0:** N(20HP). Damage = 2\/turn. Kill time = 10 turns. J(10HP) lasts 10 turns. Row is safe.\n*   **Row 1:** B(28)+R(24)=52HP. Damage = 4\/turn. Kill time = 13 turns. J's last 10 turns. After 10 turns, zombies have 52 - 40 = 12 HP left. They destroy J's, hit H(1,3) (dies 1 turn, zombies take 4 dmg, 8HP left), hit W(1,2) (dies 1 turn, zombies take 4 dmg, 4HP left), hit W(1,1) (dies 1 turn, zombies take 4 dmg, 0HP left). Zombies die.

It is attacked by I (3 damage) and R (1 damage), total 4 damage per turn. It will be destroyed at the end of Turn 51 (HP: 10 -> 6 -> 2 -> -2). This is the most critical threat.\n2.  **Line 2:** J(2,5) has 10 HP, attacked by B (1 damage). J(2,5) will last 10 turns. B(32HP) moves to (2,4) on Turn 51 and attacks W(2,4) (2HP). W(2,4) will be destroyed at the end of Turn 52 (HP: 2 -> 1 -> 0). This is the second critical threat.\n3.  **Line 0:** J(0,5) has 10 HP, attacked by N (1 damage). J(0,5) will last 10 turns.

Then B(32HP) & R(28HP) move to (1,4) and attack J(1,4) (10 HP). J(1,4) takes 2 damage per turn and lasts 5 turns (until end of T59). The line holds until Turn 59 but needs reinforcement eventually. The Peashooters (W(1,1), W(1,2)) deal 2 damage per turn. Killing B(32HP)+R(28HP)=60HP takes 30 turns.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.

The I zombie deals 3 damage, and the R zombie deals 1 damage (total 4 damage). They will destroy the Sunflower (X) at (1,3) this turn (2 HP). The next target would be the Peashooter (W) at (1,2). A defensive plant is needed immediately. A Wall-nut (J) at (1,3) costs 50 sun and has 10 HP, which can absorb the 4 damage for 2 turns.\n2.  **Line 4:** Two Normal Zombies (NN) at (4,3) attack the Peashooter (W) at (4,2). Total damage is 1+1=2. The W at (4,2) will be destroyed this turn (2 HP). The Roadblock Zombie (R) and Wall-nut Zombie (J - assuming JR means J and R zombies, but J is a plant. Let's assume it's a typo and meant maybe R and R, or N and R, or based on HP R is Roadblock so JR might mean J=Regular Zombie N? Let's assume JR means two zombies, maybe N and R based on standard zombie types. Okay, the key says J is Wall-nut plant. Hmm. Let's re-read the zombie types: N, R, B, I. There is no J zombie. Let's assume JR at (4,4) means a Roadblock zombie R that is next to a Wall-Nut J plant at (4,4) which doesn't make sense based on the grid. It's more likely JR means multiple zombies in the same cell (4,4) - maybe a Regular Zombie N and a Roadblock Zombie R? Or maybe it's just a typo and should be R? Given the format NN for two normal zombies at (4,3), let's assume JR at (4,4) means one Regular Zombie (N) and one Roadblock Zombie (R). They attack the first plant in their row, which is W at (4,1). Total damage to W(4,1) is 1(N)+1(R)=2. W(4,1) has 2 HP and will be destroyed this turn.\n3.  Let's re-evaluate Line 4 based on the key provided: J is a Wall-nut plant. So \"JR\" at (4,4) means a Wall-nut plant (J) and a Roadblock zombie (R) are in the same cell (4,4)? The rules say \"Plants cannot be placed on the same grid cell, but zombies can coexist in the same cell.\" It doesn't explicitly forbid plants and zombies in the same cell, but typically they occupy different cells once a zombie reaches a plant. However, the board shows `NN` at `(4,3)` and `JR` at `(4,4)`. Given `NN` likely means two N zombies, maybe `JR` means a zombie type `J` and a zombie type `R`? But `J` is listed as a plant. This is confusing. Let's assume the display `JR` at `(4,4)` means there's a Roadblock Zombie (R) at `(4,4)` and the `J` is a typo or display error. The R zombie attacks W(4,1). W(4,1) takes 1 damage and survives with 1 HP. The NN at (4,3) attack W(4,2), destroying it. Next turn, NN move to (4,2) and attack W(4,1). R moves to (4,3) and attacks W(4,1). W(4,1) would take 1+1+1=3 damage and die.\n\n**Revised Plan based on JR = R zombie:**\n- **Line 1:** Plant J at (1,3). Cost 50. Blocks I+R (4 damage). Survives for 2 turns.\n- **Line 4:** W(4,2) dies. W(4,1) survives with 1 HP this turn but dies next turn. Need to protect W(4,1) or replace it. Planting J at (4,2) (Cost 50) blocks NN (2 damage), J survives 5 turns. R at (4,4) still attacks W(4,1), W(4,1) dies next turn. Planting J at (4,1) (Cost 50) replaces W(4,1). NN attack W(4,2) (dies). R attacks J(4,1) (1 damage). J survives. Next turn, NN move to (4,2) and attack J(4,1). R moves to (4,3) and attacks J(4,1). J takes 1+1+1=3 damage. This seems the best defensive option for Line 4.\n\n**Decision:**\nPlant J at (1,3) and J at (4,1).\nCost: 50 + 50 = 100 sun.\nSun remaining: 290 - 100 = 190 sun.\n\n```\nAnswer: J 1 3;J 4 1\n```","```\nAnswer: J 1 2;J 4 1;W 1 0\n```","```\nAnswer: F 1 2;J 4 3\n```","Answer: F 3 5;J 1 1;W 4 0;W 0 3;W 2 3","```\nAnswer: F 1 6; J 0 4; J 4 3\n```","```\nTurn:63 | Sun:185 | Score: 63\n\nCurrent Battlefield (X: Sunflower, W: Peashooter, S: Three-Line Shooter, J: Wall-nut, H: Torch Stump, F: Fire Chili, N: Zombie, R: Roadblock Zombie,B: Bucket Zombie,I: High-Attack Zombie)\nLine0|X  |X  |X  |W  |JN |0  |0  \nLine1|X  |W  |0  |0  |0  |0  |0  \nLine2|X  |X  |X  |X  |WB |0  |0  \nLine3|X  |X  |W  |W  |0  |0  |0  \nLine4|X  |N  |0  |J  |JR |0  |0  \n\nAction Analysis:\n1.  **Line 2:** A Bucket Zombie (B, 12 + 24 = 36 HP) is attacking a Peashooter (W, 2 HP) at (2, 4).

Will gain 25 (base) + 6 * 10 (Sunflowers) = 85 next turn.\n2.  **Threats:**\n    *   Row 0: Zombie (N) attacking Wall-nut (J) at (0,3). Another Zombie (N) at (0,4) advancing. Peashooter (W) at (0,1) is attacking the zombie at (0,3).\n    *   Row 3: Roadblock Zombie (R) at (3,4) advancing towards Wall-nut (J) at (3,2). No offensive plant in this row yet.\n3.  **Options:**\n    *   **Peashooter (W) at (3,1):** Costs 100 sun. Addresses the Roadblock Zombie in row 3. Leaves 25 sun.\n    *   **Torch Stump (H) at (0,2):** Costs 125 sun. Doubles the damage of the Peashooter at (0,1) in row 0, helping clear the two zombies faster. Leaves 0 sun.\n    *   **Sunflower (X) in row 1 or 2:** Costs 50 sun. Increases sun generation. Leaves 75 sun.\n    *   **Wall-nut (J) at (0,2) or (3,1):** Costs 50 sun. Adds defense. Leaves 75 sun.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe most pressing issue is the lack of offense in row 3 against a Roadblock Zombie. However, row 0 has two zombies advancing. Boosting the Peashooter in row 0 with a Torch Stump will significantly increase damage output (from 1 to 2 per shot) against both zombies once the first one falls, potentially clearing the row faster. The Wall-nut in row 3 can hold the Roadblock Zombie for a while (10 turns), giving time to plant an attacker there next turn. Placing the Torch Stump uses all the sun but provides a strong immediate boost where multiple zombies are present.\n\nAnswer: H 0 2","Answer: X 3 1","```markdown\nAnswer: W 3 2","```plantuml\n@startuml\nskinparam monochrome true\nskinparam shadowing false\nskinparam defaultFontName Courier\nskinparam noteFontSize 10\n\nactor Player\n\nparticipant \"GameTurn 16\" as Turn16\nparticipant \"Board\" as Board\nparticipant \"Sun\" as Sun\nparticipant \"Score\" as Score\nparticipant \"Zombies\" as Zombies\nparticipant \"Plants\" as Plants\n\nactivate Player\nPlayer -> Turn16 : Receive Game State\nactivate Turn16\n\nTurn16 -> Board : Display Board State\nnote right of Board\nLine0|X  |W  |H  |JN |0  |0  |0\nLine1|X  |X  |0  |0  |0  |0  |0\nLine2|X  |X  |0  |0  |0  |0  |R (2,6) HP=12\nLine3|X  |X  |JR |0  |0  |0  |R (3,3) HP=12 vs J(3,2) HP=10\nLine4|J  |W  |0  |0  |0  |0  |0\nN(0,3) HP=8 vs J(0,3) HP=10\nW(0,1)+H(0,2) attacks N -> 2 dmg\/turn\nN attacks J -> 1 dmg\/turn\nR(3,3) attacks J(3,2) -> 1 dmg\/turn\nend note\n\nTurn16 -> Sun : Display Sun = 225\nTurn16 -> Score : Display Score = 16\nTurn16 -> Turn16 : Analyze Threats\nnote right of Turn16\n1.

Assuming the zombie spawned after turn 10 (HP 8) and just reached column 3, it likely has low HP. The Wall-nut (J 0 3) is taking damage but should hold until the zombie is defeated within the next 1-2 turns.\n2.  **Line 1:** Currently undefended but has two Sunflowers generating sun.\n3.  **Line 2:** Has two Sunflowers. A Roadblock Zombie (R 2 6) with 12 HP (spawned post-turn 10) is approaching. It needs addressing soon.\n4.  **Line 3:** A Roadblock Zombie (R 3 3) with 12 HP is attacking the Wall-nut (J 3 2), which has 10 HP. Without intervention, the Wall-nut will fall in 10 turns, but the zombie will remain. Adding offense here is critical to save the Wall-nut.\n5.  **Line 4:** Seems secure with a Wall-nut (J 4 0) and Peashooter (W 4 1).\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe most critical issue is the Roadblock Zombie in Line 3 attacking the Wall-nut. We need to add damage to that lane quickly. Planting a Peashooter boosted by a Torch Stump is the most sun-efficient way to increase damage significantly.\n\n*   Plant Peashooter (W) at (3, 0). Cost: 100 Sun. Remaining: 125 Sun.\n*   Plant Torch Stump (H) at (3, 1). Cost: 125 Sun. Remaining: 0 Sun.\n\nThis combination (W 3 0 + H 3 1) will deal 1+1 = 2 damage per turn to the Roadblock Zombie (R 3 3). With 12 HP, it will take 6 turns to defeat. The Wall-nut (J 3 2) has 10 HP and takes 1 damage per turn, so it will survive. This uses all available sun but secures Line 3. Line 2 will need attention next turn.\n\n**Answer:** W 3 0;H 3 1","```\nAnswer: W 3 2;W 2 2\n```","```\nAnswer: W 1 2;W 3 3;W 4 2\n```","Answer: J 2 3","```\nAnswer: X 1 3;W 3 1\n```","```\nAnswer: W 1 0;J 4 3;X 0 4\n```","```\nAnswer: W 3 3;J 3 3\n```","```\nTurn:23 | Sun:240 | Score: 23\n\nBoard Analysis:\nLine0|X(2) |W(2) |H(2) |J(10)|X(2) |0    |0       - Safe.

W(1,2) will be destroyed.\n*   L3: W(1HP) at (3,3) will be destroyed by R3(3,4). J(8HP) at (3,2) under attack by R1(7HP) & R2(8HP).\n\nProblem: Row 1 defense (W(1,2)) will fall in the next turn, followed quickly by X(1,1) and X(1,0). Row 3 defense W(3,3) will also fall.\n\nOptions (Sun: 240):\n1.  Fire Chili (F) on Row 1 (Cost 300): Not enough sun.\n2.  Wall-nut (J) on Row 1 (Cost 50): Cannot plant J(1,3) (X there) or J(1,4) (I there). Cannot preemptively replace W(1,2).\n3.  Peashooter (W) on Row 1 (Cost 100): Plant W(1,5). This adds 1 damage per turn to I(1,4).\n4.  Peashooter (W) on Row 3 (Cost 100): Plant W(3,5). This adds 1 damage per turn to R(3,4).\n5.  Do Nothing: Save sun (365 for T24), but lose W(1,2) and W(3,3). Row 1 becomes critical quickly.\n\nAnalysis of W(1,5):\n*   Cost: 100 sun. Remaining: 140 sun.\n*   Effect T23->T24: W(1,2)+W(1,5) hit I(1,4). I HP: 6 -> 4. I(1,4) still kills X(1,3). I moves to (1,3). W(3,3) HP: 1. J(3,2) HP: 8.

Sun at start T25: 265 + 125 = 390. (Spawn Turn!)\n*   Effect T25->T26: W(1,5) hits I(1,2). I HP: 2 -> 1. I(1,2) kills X(1,1). I moves to (1,1). J(3,2) HP 3.\n*   Effect T26->T27: W(1,5) hits I(1,1). I HP: 1 -> 0. I dies. I(1,1) kills X(1,0).\nOutcome: Row 1 loses X(1,3), W(1,2), X(1,1), X(1,0). Zombie I is killed before reaching the house. This is better than doing nothing. Row 3 defense still needs addressing later.\n\nDecision: Planting W(1,5) seems the best available move to mitigate the immediate threat in Row 1 without exhausting sun completely.\n\n```\nAnswer: W 1 5\n```","```\nAnswer: X 0 5\n```","```\nAnswer: F 3 0\n```","```\nTurn:26 | Sun:445 | Score: 26\n\nCurrent Battlefield (X: Sunflower, W: Peashooter, S: Three-Line Shooter, J: Wall-nut, H: Torch Stump, F: Fire Chili, N: Zombie, R: Roadblock Zombie,B: Bucket Zombie,I: High-Attack Zombie)\nLine0|X  |W  |H  |J  |X  |X  |0  \nLine1|X  |X  |WI |0  |0  |W  |0  \nLine2|X  |X  |W  |JR |0  |0  |0  \nLine3|XR |R  |0  |R  |0  |0  |0  \nLine4|J  |W  |W  |JR |0  |0  |IBB\n\n```\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Sun Calculation (Start of Turn 27):** Current Sun (445) + Base Sun (25) + Sunflower Sun (X(0,0), X(0,4), X(0,5), X(1,0), X(1,1), X(2,0), X(2,1), X(3,0) = 8 * 10 = 80) = 445 + 25 + 80 = 550 Sun. *Correction: The decision needs to be made based on the current 445 sun.*\n\n2.  **Threat Assessment:**\n    *   **Row 3:** Critical. R(3,0), R(3,1), R(3,2) are advancing. R(3,0) is attacking X(3,0) (which will be destroyed this turn). The zombies will reach column 0 quickly. This row needs an immediate solution.\n    *   **Row 1:** Urgent. I(1,2) (High-Attack Zombie, 6 HP) is attacking W(1,2) (Peashooter, 2 HP). I(1,2) deals 3 damage, destroying W(1,2) this turn. Next turn, I(1,2) will move to (1,2) and attack X(1,1).\n    *   **Row 4:** Concerning. R(4,3) (Roadblock Zombie, 8 HP) is attacking J(4,3) (Wall-nut, 10 HP). The IBB group (1x High-Attack, 2x Bucket, all with +8 HP) at (4,6) will move to (4,5) this turn.\n    *   **Row 0:** Stable.\n    *   **Row 2:** Stable for now. R(2,3) (8 HP) attacking J(2,3) (10 HP).\n\n3.  **Actions & Strategy (with 445 Sun):**\n    *   **Row 3:** The zombie group must be cleared immediately. A Fire Chili (F) is the best option. F(3,3) costs 300 sun. This will eliminate R(3,0), R(3,1), R(3,2). Sun: 445 -> 145.\n    *   **Row 1:** W(1,2) will be destroyed this turn by I(1,2). At the start of next turn (Turn 27), I(1,2) will have 4 HP (after being hit by W(1,5) twice) and will be located at (1,2). It will then attack X(1,1). To prevent I(1,2) from destroying X(1,1) and subsequently X(1,0), we need more firepower. Planting W(1,3) costs 100 sun. Sun: 145 -> 45.\n        *   *Turn 27 Actions:* Plant F(3,3), W(1,3).\n        *   *Combat:* W(1,5) hits I(1,2) -> 3 HP. W(1,3) hits I(1,2) -> 2 HP. I(1,2) destroys the already present W(1,2).\n        *   *Zombie Movement:* I(1,2) moves to (1,2).\n        *   *Next Turn (28):* I(1,2) attacks X(1,1). W(1,5) + W(1,3) attack I(1,2), dealing 2 damage, killing it before it destroys X(1,1). *Correction: I(1,2) will destroy W(1,2) in Turn 26's Zombie Action phase. At the start of Turn 27, I(1,2) is at (1,2) with 4 HP. W(1,5) will hit it -> 3HP. If we plant W(1,3), it will also hit I(1,2) -> 2HP. Then I(1,2) will attack X(1,1), destroying it. Then I(1,2) moves to (1,1). Next turn W(1,5)+W(1,3) kill it. This means X(1,1) is lost, but X(1,0) is saved.* This seems the best course to save the row long-term.\n    *   **Row 4:** With 45 sun remaining, no other plants can be placed. The existing W(4,1) and W(4,2) will continue to damage R(4,3). J(4,3) will take more damage. The IBB group will advance. We need to save sun for future defenses here.\n\n4.  **Final Plan:**\n    *   Plant Fire Chili in Row 3, Column 3 (F 3 3) to eliminate the immediate threat. (Cost: 300 Sun)\n    *   Plant Peashooter in Row 1, Column 3 (W 1 3) to deal with the High-Attack Zombie, saving X(1,0) at the cost of X(1,1). (Cost: 100 Sun)\n    *   Total Cost: 400 Sun.

(N: 20 HP, R: 24 HP, B: 28 HP, I: 22 HP). Next spawn is Turn 55 (6 zombies).\n3.  **Row 0:** N(20HP) at (0,6). Will attack J(0,5) next turn. J(10HP) vs N(1dmg). Defense holds for 10 turns. Damage (W(0,1)+H(0,2)) = 2\/turn. N dies in 10 turns. Stable.\n4.  **Row 1:** R(24HP) at (1,6). Will reach J(1,4) in 2 turns. J(10HP) vs R(1dmg). Defense holds for 10 turns. Damage (W(1,2)+W(1,3)) = 2\/turn. R dies in 12 turns. Stable, but J will fall eventually.\n5.  **Row 2:** N(20HP) at (2,6) moves left. N(20HP) at (2,4) attacks J(2,3). J(10HP) vs N(1dmg). Holds for 10 turns. N(2,6) arrives in 3 turns, increasing pressure to 2dmg\/turn. W(2,2) deals 1 dmg\/turn to N(2,4). Manageable for now.\n6.  **Row 3:** R(24HP)+N(20HP) at (3,6) move left. No shooters. They will reach J(3,2) in 4 turns. J(10HP) vs R+N(2dmg). J(3,2) will fall in 5 turns after contact.

W(4,4) has 2HP and takes 1(B)+1(N)=2 damage\/turn. It will die *this turn* (Turn 51). Then the combined zombies (B+N+N next turn) will quickly destroy W(4,3), X(4,2), etc.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Address Row 4:** The only way to reliably save Row 4 is to eliminate the immediate threat. Fire Chili (F) costs 300 sun and clears the entire row of zombies (B(4,5), N(4,5), N(4,6)). This is necessary to prevent a breach.\n2.  **Invest Remaining Sun:** After using Fire Chili, you have 390 - 300 = 90 sun. Planting a Sunflower (X, cost 50) is a good investment. Row 3 needs future defensive upgrades (damage), so placing a Sunflower there (e.g., at (3,1)) is reasonable.\n\n**Action:**\n\n1.  Plant Fire Chili in Row 4 (e.g., at column 6) to clear all zombies. Cost: 300 Sun.\n2.  Plant Sunflower in Row 3, Column 1. Cost: 50 Sun.\n\nTotal Cost: 350 Sun.

Their HP will be Base HP + 20. (N=24, R=28, B=32, I=26).\n\n**Lane Analysis (Assuming existing zombies also have +20 HP):**\n- **Line 0:** N(24HP) at (0, 5) vs J(10HP) at (0, 4). Damage dealt by W(0,1)+H(0,2) = 1+1=2 HP\/turn. Zombie takes 1 damage\/turn. J will last 10 turns. Zombie will be defeated in 12 turns. The Wall-nut will fall just before the zombie is killed. It needs reinforcement soon.\n- **Line 1:** R(28HP) at (1, 4) vs J(10HP) at (1, 4). Damage dealt by W(1,2)+W(1,3) = 1+1=2 HP\/turn. Zombie takes 1 damage\/turn. J will last 10 turns. Zombie will be defeated in 14 turns. The Wall-nut will fall before the zombie is killed. It needs reinforcement soon.\n- **Line 2:** N1(24HP) at (2, 3) vs J(10HP) at (2, 3). Damage dealt by W(2,2) = 1 HP\/turn. Zombie takes 1 damage\/turn. J will last 10 turns. Zombie will be defeated in 24 turns. J falls first. N2(24HP) at (2, 6) vs W(2HP) at (2, 5). Damage dealt by W(2,5) = 1 HP\/turn. Zombie takes 1 damage\/turn. W will last 2 turns. N2 will have 22 HP left. N2 will then attack J(10HP) at (2, 6), which will last 10 turns. N2 takes no further damage during this time. This lane is unstable.\n- **Line 3:** R(28HP) & N(24HP) at (3, 4) vs J(10HP) at (3, 4). Damage dealt = 0 HP\/turn. Zombies take 1+1=2 damage\/turn. J will last 10\/2 = 5 turns. This lane will fall quickly. **Critical Threat.**\n- **Line 4:** No zombies. Stable.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  **Address Critical Threat:** Line 3 needs immediate attention. The J(3, 4) will fall in 5 turns, and there's no damage output. A Fire Chili (F) is the most effective solution here. Planting F at (3, 0) will replace a Sunflower but instantly clear the threatening zombies. Cost: 300 Sun.\n2.  **Assess Remaining Resources:** After planting F 3 0, we have 490 - 300 = 190 Sun.\n3.  **Address Line 2:** Line 2 is the next most problematic. W(2, 5) will fall quickly, and N2(2, 6) will eventually break through J(2, 6) without taking further damage. J(2, 3) will also fall to N1(2, 3). Adding a simple plant like a Peashooter (W) or Wall-nut (J) with the remaining 190 sun doesn't seem sufficient to stabilize both threats, especially with 6 new powerful zombies spawning.\n4.  **Conserve Sun:** Given that 6 new zombies are spawning this turn and Line 2 requires a more robust solution than affordable right now, it might be best to use the Fire Chili on the critical lane and save the remaining 190 Sun to react to the new zombie placement and reinforce Line 2 next turn.\n\n**Action:**\nPlant Fire Chili in Line 3 to eliminate the immediate threat.\n\nAnswer: F 3 0","Answer: F 2 6;W 3 2;W 1 1;J 0 4","Okay, here's the plan for this turn:\n\n1.  **Line 2:** The situation is critical with multiple strong zombies (N: 24HP, R: 28HP) attacking a Wall-nut (J) that will fall in 3 turns. The Peashooters (W) deal only 2 damage per turn against 100 total HP. Using a Fire Chili (F) is the most effective solution here. Place F at (2,4) to clear the row.\n2.  **Line 3:** This line has no offense, and the Wall-nut (J) at (3,4) will fall in about 4 turns once the Bucket Zombie (B: 32HP) arrives next turn. The total zombie HP is 84 (R: 28HP, N: 24HP, B: 32HP). Using a Fire Chili here as well will eliminate the threat immediately. Place F at (3,5).\n3.  **Line 1:** The Wall-nut (J) at (1,4) is attacked by a Roadblock Zombie (R: 28HP) and will soon be attacked by a High-Attack Zombie (I: 26HP) next turn. It will fall in about 3 turns under combined attack (4 damage\/turn). The current plant damage is 2\/turn. While not ideal, clearing Lines 2 and 3 is the priority. With the remaining sun after using two Fire Chilies (690 - 300 - 300 = 90 sun), we can plant a backup Wall-nut (J) at (1,6) for 50 sun. This will block the zombies after J(1,4) falls.\n\n**Plan:**\n- Plant Fire Chili at Row 2, Column 4 (Cost 300)\n- Plant Fire Chili at Row 3, Column 5 (Cost 300)\n- Plant Wall-nut at Row 1, Column 6 (Cost 50)\nTotal Cost: 650 Sun.

The Roadblock Zombie (R) at (1,5) has 32 HP. Assuming the standard PvZ turn order (Plants act, Player acts, Zombies move, Zombies act), W(1,3) will be destroyed at the end of this turn (Turn 60) when the I(1,4) moves to (1,3) and attacks.

The combined attack is 1+1=2 damage per turn. J(0,3) will last 5 turns. The W(0,1) boosted by H(0,2) deals 2 damage per turn to the first zombie. It will take 28 \/ 2 = 14 turns to kill one N, and 28 turns total for both.

N will advance to (1,3), I will advance to (2,3). Then they will destroy X(0,3) very quickly (in 1 turn, Turn 78). Incoming NBR (~HP 32, 40, 36) at col 5. This row is in critical condition.\n    - **Line 4:** Clear. J(0,4), X(1,4), X(2,4), W(3,4). Safe.\n- **Upcoming Events:**\n    - Turn 80: Spawn 1 + (80\/10) = 9 zombies. HP bonus + (80\/10)*4 = +32.\n\n**2. Strategy Formulation:**\n- Row 3 is the immediate priority. J(2,3) will fall this turn. N(1,3) and I(2,3) will then destroy X(0,3) on Turn 78. The incoming NBR wave is also dangerous.\n- With 160 Sun, options are limited:\n    - W(0,3) (100 Sun): Will be destroyed quickly by N+I.\n    - J(0,3) (50 Sun): Can't place, N(1,3) will occupy (0,3) after X(0,3) falls. Also wouldn't last long against N+I+NBR.\n    - H(3,2) (125 Sun): Boosts Row 2 damage, but doesn't save Row 3.\n- Saving Sun for Fire Chili (F - 300 Sun) seems necessary for Row 3.\n    - Current Sun: 160\n    - Sun at start of Turn 78: 160 + 95 = 255\n    - Sun at start of Turn 79: 255 + 95 = 350\n- Timeline for Fire Chili:\n    - Turn 77: Do nothing. J(2,3) dies. N->(1,3), I->(2,3). Zombies in col 5 -> col 4.\n    - Turn 78: Do nothing. N(1,3) and I(1,3) (after moving) destroy X(0,3). N->(0,3), I->(0,3). Zombies in col 4 -> col 3. Zombies NBR(3,4) -> (3,3).\n    - Turn 79: Use 300 Sun to plant F(1,3) (or F(2,3), F(3,3) etc.). This will instantly clear all zombies in Row 3: N(0,3), I(0,3), NBR(3,3).\n- This plan sacrifices the Sunflower X(0,3) but saves the lane entirely. Planting anything else this turn would likely prevent accumulating 300 Sun by Turn 79.\n\n**3. Action for Turn 77:**\n- Based on the analysis, the best course of action is to save sun for the Fire Chili on Turn 79. No plants will be planted this turn.\n\nAnswer:","Answer: J 3 0;W 3 1;W 2 3","```markdown\nAnalysis:\n1.  **Sun Calculation:** Current Sun: 170. Sunflowers: 7 (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1), (4,1), (4,2). Sun generated next turn: 25 (base) + 7 * 10 = 95. Sun after placing plants: 170 - Cost.\n2.  **Threat Assessment:**\n    *   **Line 3:** Most critical. Sunflower X(3,0) is attacked by N(3,0) (HP 32, Dmg 1). X(3,0) has 2 HP, will die in 2 turns. High-Attack Zombie I(3,2) (HP 34, Dmg 3) will move to (3,1) next turn and attack W(3,1) (HP 2). Zombie cluster NBR(3,3) (HP 32, 40, 36) will follow. Letting X(3,0) die is risky as I(3,2) will then destroy W(3,1) immediately.\n    *   **Line 0:** J(0,4) vs R(0,4) (HP 36). W(0,1) attacks R. J(0,4) lasts 10 turns. Manageable.\n    *   **Line 1:** J(1,4) vs B(1,4) (HP 40). W(1,2)+W(1,3) attack B. J(1,4) lasts 10 turns. Manageable.\n    *   **Line 2:** J(2,4) vs N(2,4)+B(2,4) (HP 32, 40, Total Dmg 2). W(2,2)+W(2,3) attack N. J(2,4) lasts 5 turns. Needs attention soon.\n3.  **Strategy for Line 3:**\n    *   We must prevent I(3,2) from reaching W(3,1) immediately.\n    *   Placing a Wall-nut J at (3,2) (Cost 50) will block I(3,2) and the following zombies (NBR). J(3,2) has 10 HP and will face 3 (I) + 1 (N) + 1 (B) + 1 (R) = 6 damage per turn once the NBR cluster arrives at (3,2) next turn. It will last only 2 turns (Turn 80, 81).\n    *   Placing J(3,2) allows W(3,1) to survive longer and keep attacking N(3,0) initially, then I(3,2).\n    *   However, X(3,0) will still die in 2 turns to N(3,0). W(3,1) alone deals only 1 damage to N(3,0) (HP 32).\n    *   We need more damage in Line 3. With the remaining sun (170 - 50 = 120), we can plant a Peashooter W (Cost 100). Placing W at (3,4) adds 1 damage to the front zombie (N(3,0) first, then I(3,2)).\n    *   This plan (J 3 2; W 3 4) costs 150 sun, leaving 20. It buys time and increases damage in the critical lane.\n\nAction: Plant J at (3,2) and W at (3,4).\n\n```Answer: J 3 2;W 3 4","Answer: J 3 0;X 4 1","```\nAnswer: H 3 5\n```","```\nAnswer: J 3 5;J 2 3\n```","Okay, let's analyze the situation based on the \"attacks plant blocking entry to next cell\" rule.\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n- **Turn:** 83\n- **Sun:** 235\n- **Score:** 83\n- **Sunflowers:** 6 (generating 60 sun next turn)\n- **Total Sun Next Turn:** 235 + 25 (base) + 60 (sunflowers) = 320\n\n**Threat Assessment (Actions happening *this* turn, Turn 83):**\n- **Line 0:** Zombies R(40), B(44), I(38), N(36) at col 4 attempt to move to col 3.

You only have enough sun (355) for one Fire Chili.\n\nSince the game is lost regardless of the action, the best approach might be to address the most immediate breach on Line 2. Placing a Fire Chili there is the only way to clear those zombies.\n\n**Action:**\nPlant Fire Chili (F) on Line 2 to clear the zombies that have reached the house.

The game is played on a 5×7 board, where zombies spawn from the far right side and move one step to the left each turn. The types of plants and zombies are as follows:\n\nPlants  \n- Sunflower (X): Costs 50 sun, has 2 HP, and generates an extra 10 sun each turn.  \n- Peashooter (W): Costs 100 sun, has 2 HP, and deals 1 damage each turn to the first zombie in its current row.  \n- Three-Line Shooter (S): Costs 325 sun, has 2 HP, and deals 1 damage each turn to the first zombie in its current row as well as the first zombie in each of the adjacent rows.  \n- Wall-nut (J): Costs 50 sun and has 10 HP.  \n- Torch Stump (H): Costs 125 sun, has 2 HP; it increases the damage of the plant to its left in the same row (applied directly to the plant rather than to a projectile) by +1, and this effect can only be applied once.  \n- Fire Chili (F): Costs 300 sun and eliminates all zombies in its row.\n\nZombies  \n- Regular Zombie (N): Has 4 HP and deals 1 damage each turn to the plant that blocks its path.  \n- Roadblock Zombie (R): Has 8 HP and deals 1 damage each turn to the plant that blocks its path.  \n- Bucket Zombie (B): Has 12 HP and deals 1 damage each turn to the plant that blocks its path.  \n- High-Attack Zombie (I): Has 6 HP and deals 3 damage each turn to the plant that blocks its path.\n\nRules  \n- At least 25 sun is gained each turn.\n- A new zombie is spawned every 5 turns.\n- After every 10 turns, newly spawned zombies have their HP increased by 4, and the number of zombies spawned increases by 1.\n- Your score increases by 1 each turn.\n- The game lasts for a maximum of 100 turns.\n- Plants cannot be placed on the same grid cell, but zombies can coexist in the same cell.\n- There are no lawn mowers.\n- Roadblock Zombies only spawn after turn 10, and Bucket Zombies and High-Attack Zombies only spawn after turn 20.\n\nPlease input in the format \"PlantType Row Column\".
