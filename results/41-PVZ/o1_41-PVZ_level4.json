Since you have exactly 110 sun, placing one Peashooter (100 sun) in row 0, column 5 leaves you with 10 sun remaining (not enough to place any other plant this turn). Thus the simplest effective play is:\n\nAnswer: W 0 5","Answer: J 3 3","A sensible next step is to ensure the High‐Attack Zombie in row 4 (which will chew through the lone Wall‐nut) begins taking damage right away. With only 130 sun, you cannot yet afford a Fire Chili. Placing a Peashooter at (row 4, col 0) ensures it will have enough turns to whittle down the 6 HP zombie before it reaches the left edge. One good move is therefore:\n\nAnswer: W 4 0","A practical short‐term move is to shore up the lanes where a single Peashooter cannot finish off the advancing zombies in time. One efficient way is to drop Wall‐nuts in front of those threats to buy extra turns for your existing shooters. For example:\n\nAnswer: J 1 4;J 4 4\n\nThis uses 100 of your 115 sun (50 each), leaving 15 sun. The new Walnuts in row 1 and row 4 will hold off the zombies long enough for your Peashooters to chip away at their increased HP. Then, on subsequent turns, you can add more damage (another Peashooter or a Torch Stump) or use Fire Chili when you’ve built up sufficient sun.","Answer: W 2 5\n\nExplanation:  \nThe most pressing threat right now is the Roadblock Zombie (R) on row 2, which is blocked only by a single Wall‑nut (J) and is otherwise taking no damage. Placing a Peashooter (W) at (row 2, col 5) will start whittling down the zombie’s HP before it destroys the Wall‑nut and marches left through the sunflowers. You have just enough sun (100) to afford one Peashooter this turn, and row 2 is the highest priority since that Roadblock Zombie will eventually break through if left unchallenged.  ","Answer: X 4 1","A straightforward way to prevent the bucket zombie on row 3 from eventually chewing through both Wall‑nuts unchecked is to add some firepower there. One efficient move is to place a single Peashooter in row 3, column 2. That will begin chipping away at the Bucket Zombie and keep it from eventually breaking through. With 130 sun, you can afford exactly one Peashooter (cost 100), leaving you with 30 sun remaining.\n\nAnswer: W 3 2","A good way to keep the Row 1 Wall‑nut from being overrun by two zombies (the Normal Zombie and then the High‑Attack Zombie) is to add a second Peashooter behind it. Placing “W 1 2” ensures that both Peashooters concentrate fire on the Normal Zombie first (killing it quickly) and then turn their combined damage on the High‑Attack Zombie before it can destroy the Wall‑nut. Thus, a suitable move this turn is:\n\nAnswer: W 1 2","Answer: W 2 6","Answer: W 4 2","Answer: W 1 3","A good way to preserve most of Row 1 (where the 6 HP, 3 damage zombie would otherwise wipe out all three peashooters and the sunflower) is to add one more peashooter on an empty column to the right so it can help focus‐fire that zombie down before it advances through all your plants. For example:\n\nAnswer: W 1 5\n\nExplanation (brief outline):  \n• The high‐attack zombie (6 HP) on row 1 will kill each plant in one hit if left alone.  \n• By adding a new Peashooter (W) to (row 1, column 5 or 6), you get four total shots on its first turn (the three existing peashooters plus the new one). This reduces the zombie from 6 HP to 2. Although it destroys the peashooter in column 3, it will then move there with only 2 HP remaining.  \n• On the following turn, the remaining two peashooters plus the newly planted peashooter will deal 3 damage and finish that zombie before it can destroy anything else in row 1, saving your other plants in that row.","Answer: J 1 4;J 2 4","Answer: J 1 6","Answer: W 2 6","Answer: J 2 3;J 3 1","Answer: W 2 5","Answer: J 1 5","Answer: J 2 2;J 3 3","Answer: J 2 4","Answer: J 1 3;X 4 3","Answer: W 3 2","Answer: J 4 5","Answer: X 0 0;J 2 6","Answer: W 2 3","Answer: J 2 5; J 1 6","Answer: J 3 2; X 0 1"],"prompt":"\nIn the following, you are required to participate in a simplified version of the Plants vs. Zombies game.
