A good first - move is to build a wall at the empty space adjacent to the cat that leads it closer to the exits. The cat is at (5, 5). One of the key empty spaces to block is (5, 6) as it is an adjacent empty space that the cat could move to and get closer to some of the exits on the right - hand side of the board.\n\nAnswer: 5 6","To trap the cat, we need to block its possible paths to the exits. One of the immediate paths the cat can take is towards the right - hand side. We can build a wall at the empty space adjacent to the cat in that direction. The cat is at (4,4), and an empty space adjacent to it on the right is (4,5). Building a wall there will start to limit the cat's movement.\nAnswer: 4 5","1. Analyze the cat's possible moves:\n   - The cat is at (4, 4). Its possible adjacent - empty - space moves are to (4, 3), (4, 5), (3, 4), (5, 4).\n   - To start trapping the cat, we can block one of its most critical escape - paths. A good first move is to build a wall at (4, 5) to limit its upward movement towards the upper - side exits.\n2. Output in the required format:\nAnswer: 4 5","To trap the cat, we need to block its possible paths to the exits. The cat is at (4,4). One of the closest exits is in the upper - right direction. We can start by building a wall to block the most direct path to that exit.\nWe build a wall at (5,5) to start constricting the cat's movement towards the exits.\nAnswer: 5 5","To trap the cat which is at (3,5), we can build a wall at a key - position that blocks its path to the exits. A good first - move would be to build a wall at (4,5) as it restricts the cat's movement towards the upper - right direction.\nAnswer: 4 5","To trap the cat which is at (3,5), we can start by blocking one of its potential escape - routes. A good first move is to build a wall at (3,4) to prevent the cat from moving leftward easily.\n\nAnswer: 3 4","To trap the cat located at (3,5), a good first - move is to block one of its possible escape routes. One such route is towards the right - hand side. We can place a wall at the empty space adjacent to it in that direction. So, we build a wall at (3,6).\nAnswer: 3 6","To trap the cat starting at (2,4), we can first block its closest potential escape - routes. One good first - move is to place a wall at (2,5) to prevent the cat from moving further right.\n\nAnswer: 2 5","To trap the cat, we can start by blocking its most immediate paths to the exits. One of the closest exits for the cat at position (1, 4) is towards the bottom - left. We can build a wall at the empty space adjacent to the cat in the direction of the closest exit. An appropriate position to build a wall is (0, 3).\n\nAnswer: 0 3","To trap the cat effectively, we can start by blocking the most immediate paths it can take to reach the exits. A good first - move is to place a wall in a cell that cuts off one of its main escape routes. Looking at the cat's position (2, 3), a good place to build a wall is (3, 3) as it will limit the cat's movement towards the right - hand side exits for now.\n\nAnswer: 3 3","1. Analyze the cat's possible moves:\n   - The cat is at position (1, 3). Its possible adjacent - empty - space moves are to (1, 2), (1, 4), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4).\n   - To start trapping the cat, we can block one of its most critical escape - paths. A good first move is to place a wall at (0, 3) to prevent the cat from moving downwards towards the bottom - row exits more easily.\n2. Output in the required format:\nAnswer: 0 3","To trap the cat, we can start by blocking the most immediate paths the cat can take to reach an exit. One such path - blocking move is to build a wall at the empty space adjacent to the cat that leads it towards an exit - like the one - step path to the right.\n\nAnswer: 1 3","To trap the cat, we can block the most direct paths for the cat to reach the exits. A good first - move is to place a wall at the cell that is one step away from the cat in a direction that leads to an exit. Looking at the board, the cat is at (1, 3). One of the potential exit - leading adjacent empty cells is (2, 3).\n\nAnswer: 2 3","To trap the cat starting at (1,2), we can block the most likely escape - paths. One good first - move is to build a wall at (1,3) to prevent the cat from moving further right.\nAnswer: 1 3"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board which is a picture and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The cat's goal is to run to the exit and escape, while your goal is to trap the cat with walls. The cat and you take turns; on each turn, the cat can move one cell to an adjacent empty space, and on your turn you can create a wall on an empty space, but not on an exit. If the cat reaches the exit, you lose; if you successfully trap the cat, you win. You need to output a set of coordinates each turn to indicate where you build a wall, e.g. \"Answer: 7 6\".\n","epoch":15,"have_image":true}
