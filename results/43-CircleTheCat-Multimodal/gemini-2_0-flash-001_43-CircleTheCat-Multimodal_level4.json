Let's start by analyzing the board and the cat's position. The cat is currently at (3,0).\n\nHere's a possible strategy and the first move:\n\n1.  **Assess the situation:** The cat is at (3,0). The exits are at (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0), (9,0), (10,0), (0,2), (0,4), (0,6), (0,7), (0,10), (1,10), (2,10), (3,10), (4,10), (5,10), (6,10), (7,10), (8,10), (9,10), (10,10), (10,9), (10,1), (10,2), (10,3), (10,4), (10,5), (10,6), (10,7), (10,8).\n2.  **Immediate threats:** The exits closest to the cat are (3,0), (2,0), (4,0). The cat can move to (3,1), (3,2) (4,1), (2,1).\n3.  **First move:** Block the path towards one of the closest exits. A good move is to block (2,1) or (4,1). I'll choose (4,1).\n\nAnswer: 4 1","Okay, I understand the game. The cat starts at (3,0). I need to place walls strategically to prevent the cat from reaching any of the blue exits.\n\nHere's my strategy: I'll focus on blocking the most direct paths to the exits, while also considering the cat's potential movements in the next turn.\n\n**Turn 1:** The cat can move to (3,1), (4,0), (3,2), or (2,1).  I want to block the path to (4,0) and (2,0).\nI'll place a wall at (4,1) to block the path to the exit (4,0).\n\n**Turn 2:**  Let's assume the cat moves to (3,1) on its first move. Now, it can move to (2,1), (4,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,1), or (3,0).  I need to block the path toward exits around (2,0). I'll block (2,2).\n\n**Turn 3:** If the cat moves to (3,2), I will block cell (3,3).\n\n**Turn 4:** If the cat moves to (4,2), I will block cell (5,2).\n\n**Turn 5:** If the cat moves to (4,3), I will block cell (4,4).\n\nBased on the board and the current cat position, the optimal first move seems to be to place a wall at (4,1). This prevents the cat from easily moving towards the exit at (4,0).\n\nAnswer: 4 1","Okay, I understand the game. The cat starts at (3,0).
