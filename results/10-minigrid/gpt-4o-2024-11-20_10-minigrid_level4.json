Lava tiles are highlighted in row 4 and column 4.\n\n2. **Initial Position and Direction**: The agent is at (4, 2), facing right (→).\n\n3. **Route and Avoidance of Lava**: \n   - To avoid lava, the agent must move down and then right toward the goal.\n   - The shortest path to (7, 7) involves moving vertically first (avoiding lava in column 4) and then towards the goal horizontally.\n\n4. **Planned Actions** (First Move):\n   - From (4, 2), moving directly right to (4, 3) leads toward lava. Thus, the optimal move is to change direction and move downward instead.\n   - To move downward (face towards bottom), the agent should:\n     - Execute **turn_right** (to face downward).\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this problem:\n\n1. The agent wants to navigate to the green goal square (type=8, color=1) located at (7, 7). Currently, the agent is at (4, 2), facing down. To reach the goal, avoid the lava (type=9) and walls (type=2).\n\n2. Observe the shortest path from (4, 2) to (7, 7) while adhering to rules.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- The agent needs to move downwards and then right to avoid lava and navigate unobstructed paths. The first step involves moving downwards in the direction it is facing.\n\n- The next position, (5, 2), is clear (type=3). Therefore, the optimal next action is `move_forward`.\n\n### Response Format:\nAnswer: move_forward","First, analyze the environment:\n\n1. The agent starts at position (4,3), facing down (`↓`, or 1).\n2. The mission is to avoid lava and reach the green goal square at (7,7).\n3. Movement restrictions:\n   - Lava (represented as `9`) must be avoided.\n   - Only paths represented as `3=FLOOR` can be traversed.\n\nPlan:\nA direct path to the goal requires moving down to (7,3), then turning right and moving to (7,7). The shortest path is as follows:\n- Move forward 3 steps to reach (7,3).\n- Turn right to face the goal square at (7,7).\n- Move forward 4 steps to reach the green goal.\n\nNow, choose the first action:\n- The path directly in front of the agent (downwards) is clear, and the shortest path requires the agent to move forward.\n\n**Action**:\nThe agent should make the first move as `move_forward`.\n\nAnswer: move_forward"],"prompt":"\n    You are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a game board and rules.\n    Your task is:\n    - First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n    - Second, output the answer in the required format.

Once located, plot a path avoiding lava and other obstacles.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Pathfinding\nAnalyze the shortest path based on the agent's current location (17, 10) and goal location (coordinates obtained from the grid). Avoid walls and lava, taking account of the agent's facing direction (↑). Prioritize efficient action sequences.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Optimal Next Action\nTo begin, based on the grid and rules, calculate the immediate next step from the agent's position and orientation. Then, return an action from the predefined action list.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\nGiven the observation, the immediate action to progress toward the goal will depend on the exact location of the goal relative to the agent's position. For example:\n- If the goal is directly above the agent on a clear path: `move_forward`.\n- If the goal requires a turn first: `turn_left` or `turn_right`.\n\nConsidering no direct goal coordinates are visible in this observation, the next logical move is advancing forward to explore further upward.\n\n**Answer**: move_forward","To solve this task, we need to analyze the given observation grid and interpret the steps necessary for the agent to reach the goal. Here are the steps:\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Starting Position**: The agent is at `(17, 10)` and facing \"up\" (↑), which corresponds to the direction `3`.\n\n2. **Mission**: The task is to **reach the goal**. Based on the observation rules, the \"goal\" is identified by `object_type=8`.\n\n3. **Action Priorities**:\n   - Avoid lava (object_type=9).\n   - Follow the shortest path.\n   - Interact with doors and other objects if required.\n\n### Observations:\n- The grid contains the agent's position and other entities. To proceed, we need to locate the goal (`object_type=8`) and plan the shortest sequence of actions toward it.\n\n- From the data provided, there is no specific mention of where exactly the goal is located. To proceed, we should cross-check the grid provided. Since the grid was truncated in the position data (`...` characters represent hidden lines and blocks), the complete observation is unavailable. However, if we assume typical navigation and no immediate dangers (lava, locked doors, etc.):\n\n### Next Steps:\nGiven the current agent position `(17, 10)` and facing \"up\" (↑):\n1. Verify if the space in front of the agent is clear (EMPTY or FLOOR).\n2. If the space is clear, **move_forward**.\n\n### Assumption:\nSince the problem lacks full clarity about obstacles or goal position (due to incomplete grid), the next optimal move is likely to proceed forward along the indicated direction.\n\n---\n\n### Final Output:\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this, we must navigate the grid and locate the goal object (`object_type=8`). The agent starts at `(17, 10)` facing up (`direction=3`). Based on the observation and mission, we need to direct the agent toward the goal square while considering the rules.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Goal's Location\nUsing the observation matrix, let us search for `object_type=8` (goal). Upon inspection, the goal is at **(0, 0)**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Plan the Path\nThe agent currently resides at `(17, 10)`, and the goal is at `(0, 0)`. Since the agent starts facing upward (`direction=3`), moving forward along the shortest path involves:\n- Moving all the way up from `(17, 10)` to `(0, 10)`.\n- Then turning left at `(0, 10)` and moving leftward to the goal `(0, 0)`.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Take the First Action\nThe agent is already facing upward (↑). The path in that direction is clear, so the optimal first action is to **move forward**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Response\nAnswer: move_forward","","To determine the next move, let's analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Mission**: Reach the goal square.\n2. **Agent position**: `(17, 10)`, facing up (`direction=3`).\n3. **Grid size**: 19x19.\n4. **Analysis of environment**: The agent's goal is to find the `GOAL` square (object_type=8). As this data isn't explicitly visible in the observation snippet provided, I'll assume the goal square is in the vicinity and plan the movement step-by-step.\n5. **18 steps remaining**: Plan within this constraint.\n\nLet me break this down:\n\nThe agent is currently **facing up**. To move up towards potential areas or scan for the goal, the immediate cell above `(16, 10)` needs checking:\n- If there are obstacles like `WALLS (object_type=2)` or `LAVA (object_type=9)` blocking the path, the agent will need to rotate to adjust direction.\n- If the goal (object_type=8) isn't in a direct line, scanning the area or system reassessment .\n\nSince","To determine the optimal action, I'll interpret the grid observation and analyze the environment relative to the mission \"reach the goal.\" Here’s the breakdown:\n\n### Observations:\n- **Agent Position:** (17, 10)\n- **Agent Facing Direction:** Up (↑ corresponds to direction code `3`)\n- **Mission:** Reach the goal\n  - Look for a cell in the grid with `object_type=8` (GOAL).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. Scan the grid for the goal (type `8`):\n   - The goal is located at **(8, 8)**, as it has the value `[8, GREEN, 0]`.\n\n2. Calculate the shortest-path actions:\n   - **Currently facing up (↑):**\n     - To reach (8, 8), your path involves moving towards the top-left.\n   - Directional adjustment required:\n     - Facing up is ideal for moving up the grid. The agent does not need to rotate for upward movement.\n   \n3. Path Avoidance:\n   - There are no observed lava cells (`9`) blocking the immediate path.\n   - The path leading to (8, 8) appears unobstructed without doors, locked areas, or walls barring entry.\n\n### Next Action:\nBased on the agent's orientation and grid structure, the shortest path involves moving directly upward towards (16, 10).\n\n**Chosen Action:** `move_forward`\n\n---\n\n### Final Output:\nAnswer: move_forward","Analyzing the observation and mission:\n\n1.

Considering the grid environment, the agent needs to find the shortest path to reach the goal while obeying the rules (avoiding lava, opening doors if needed, etc.). The goal position isn't explicitly provided in this truncated grid snippet, so this action analysis assumes systematic local movement to explore the environment. Given the absence of immediate obstacles, moving forward (leftward since the agent faces left) is optimal.\n\n### Step 3: Immediate Action\nBased on the agent's current position and the orientation, the optimal action is to move forward.\n\n### Final Decision\nAnswer: move_forward","","To solve this problem, let's analyze the given mission and observation grid:\n\n### Mission\n- **Mission**: Reach the goal (object_type=8).\n\n### Observations\n- **Agent's position**: At (1, 11), facing left (←).\n- **Target (goal)**: We need to locate the cell in the grid where object_type=8.\n\n### Analysis\n1.

The cell directly below (2, 17) contains a wall (`state=-1`), so moving forward is not possible.\n   - We need to turn to find a possible path onward.\n\n4. **Optimal Action**:\n   - Since moving forward is blocked, the optimal action is to **turn right**. By doing so, the agent will rotate to face west (←), potentially finding a traversable path.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve the problem, I'll analyze the given grid and observations.\n\nThe mission is to reach the goal.

Upon closer inspection, there isn't immediate access to the entire 3D observation layout, as the grid cells appear truncated. Therefore, let's proceed assuming the GOAL's coordinates can be deduced (pending clarification).\n\n### Initial Analysis Continued:\nSince the agent is located at (1, 15) and needs to move towards the GOAL, its movement options depend on the current facing direction (`↑`). To begin:\n1. Calculate the shortest path once the GOAL location is confirmed.\n2. Rotate or move accordingly to avoid obstacles.\n\nFor now, as the GOAL's position remains unspecified, the safest and shortest path aligning with the current information will be move forward.\n\n### Output:\nAnswer: move_forward","To analyze and solve this, let's break the problem into steps.\n\nThe agent is currently at position **(1,14)** and facing **up** (`direction = 3`).

Given that the agent is facing **up**:\n- **move_forward**: Moves to the cell directly above `(1,14)`, which is `(0,14)`.\n- **turn_left** or **turn_right**: Changes the direction to explore other paths.\n\n---\n\nLet's process the given grid to locate obstacles, target, and make the optimal decision.\n\n#### Calculation Results:\n- Let's assume the goal is found at position `(X_goal, Y_goal)`.

Assuming the mission details imply navigating towards the nearest goal square (if visible), further observation is required for exact placement.\n- **Constraints:**\n  - Only provided actions can be used.\n  - Avoid `lava` (object type 9).\n  - Use inventory keys for locked doors if required.\n\nGiven the observation data and mission statement, we focus on moving forward to explore and achieve the stated goal.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nThe agent is facing right (→). The next move forward (to `(8, 16)`) is clear. Assuming no obstacles or hazards, this is the shortest and safest action.\n\n### Final Output:\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve the task, I will:\n\n1. Analyze the grid and locate the goal and any possible obstacles.\n2. Plan the first action to move the agent towards the goal while adhering to the rules.\n\nKey insights from the observation:\n- Agent's position: (8, 15), facing right (→).\n- Mission: Reach the goal.\n- The goal is the cell with `object_type=8` in the grid (color doesn't impact this task unless specified). Let's locate this cell.\n\nScanning the grid:\n- Locate the `object_type=8` (goal):\n  - The green goal square is at (12, 15).\n\nImmediate plan:\n- The agent is facing right (→) at (8, 15). To reach (12, 15), the agent needs to move forward 4 steps straight.\n\nSince the path is clear (no lava or obstacles in front), the first action will be:\n\n**Action:** `move_forward`\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Given the mission to \"reach the goal,\" I will assess the observation and determine the next optimal action.\n\nThe grid observation shows the agent at position `(8, 15)` facing right. From the grid, there is no explicit mention of where the goal is, as the array structure does not provide the full context for each cell. Specifically, the goal square's representation (object_type `8`) is not visible. This might be an issue with a partial observation or undefined instructions.\n\nUnder minimal assumptions:\n- I assume that \"shortest path\" behavior must navigate towards an explicit path if the goal square exists.\n- Without a visible goal in this sparse problem, I should avoid moving indefinitely or taking unreachable steps—thus `done`.","To solve this problem, we need to identify where the goal is in the grid and calculate the actions required for the agent to navigate to it, while following the rules and avoiding obstacles.\n\n### **Step-by-step Breakdown:**\n1. **Understand observation data**: From the grid data, the agent is located at `(8, 15)` and is facing right (→).\n   - `Observation` information provides details about the grid.\n   - `Mission` specifies the goal is to reach the green goal square.\n   - Actions are constrained by the predefined rules.\n\n2. **Find the goal**: We search within the grid to locate a cell with `[8, 1, 0]` (object type 8 = GOAL, color 1 = GREEN, state 0).\n\n   After examining the grid, we find the **green goal** at position `(9, 15)`.\n\n3. **Plan the path**:\n   - The agent starts at `(8, 15)` and needs to move to `(9, 15)`.\n   - The agent is already facing right, and the goal is directly 1 step below its current position.\n\n   To move downward, the agent needs to:\n   - **Turn right** once (from right → down)\n   - **Move forward** once to reach the goal.\n\n### **Actions Required**:\n1. `turn_right` (to face downward)\n2. `move_forward` (to reach the goal position at `(9, 15)`)\n3. `done` (mission accomplished)\n\n### **Answer**:\nSince the task requires only **one action at a time**, the next action is:  \n**Answer: turn_right**","To solve this, we need to complete the mission \"reach the goal.\" First, we analyze the given observation grid.\n\n---\n\n### Observations:\n- Agent is located at `(8, 15)` facing **down** (direction 1).\n- From coordinates `(8, 15)` we need to find the shortest path to reach the **goal square** (object_type=8).\n- The environment grid contains various objects, including walls, lava, doors, etc.\n- Lava is dangerous, so we must avoid any cells with object_type `9`.\n- Doors must either be toggled or unlocked with a matching key if locked.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step analysis based on the grid:\n1. The goal is to **find the green goal square** (object_type=8, color=1):\n   - Scan the grid for any cell where `object_type=8` and `color=1`.\n   - The goal square is not explicitly stated here. Let me clarify the analysis to search for the green goal. Since the environment is large, I'll refer only to entries that fit the game's mission.\n\n2. Next actions must **move the agent toward the goal** while complying with game rules:\n   - Before proceeding, I check the surroundings of `(8, 15)` to determine if the agent must turn or move forward.\n   - From this position, we calculate both an optimal route using direct observation (shortest path possible).\n    \n Clarfiify","","### Analysis:\n1. **Agent Position**: (8, 17), facing down (↓).\n2. **Mission**: Reach the goal.\n3. **Grid Analysis**:\n   - The goal is identified as `object_type=8` in the observation.

To reach it after toggling the red door:\n    - Move down to (8,3).\n    - Move right to (8,4), while facing the door.\n    - Toggle the blue door.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nGiven the agent's current position (7,1) and the need to move towards (3,2), the optimal next move is to turn left so the agent can move north (upwards).\n\nAnswer: turn_left","To solve this, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step:\n\n### Mission:\n- Open the **red door**.\n- Open the **blue door**.\n\n### Observations:\n1. The agent is at `(7, 1)`, facing **upward** (`↑` or 3 as per color code).\n2. Red door (`color=0`) is at `(3, 2)`.\n3. Blue door (`color=2`) is at `(8, 4)`.\n4. Doors require a \"toggle\" action to open when the agent is **facing them**.\n5. There are no obstacles such as lava in the direct approach paths.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Move toward the **red door** at `(3, 2)`:\n   - First, align the agent by turning left to face **leftward** (`←` or 2).\n   - Move forward until the agent reaches `(3, 2)`.\n   - Use the \"toggle\" action to open the red door.\n2. Move toward the **blue door** at `(8, 4)`:\n   - Turn and navigate the agent to `(8, 4)`.\n   - Use the \"toggle\" action to open the blue door.\n\n---\n\n### Immediate Action:\nThe agent is at `(7, 1)` facing upward.

This involves:\n   - Turning left (**) into a downward-facing (↓) orientation.\n   - Moving downward (**) to enter the correct row (around `(8,1)`).\n- Well a d","","### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\nThe mission is **\"open the red door then the blue door\"**. From the observation grid, we need to identify the following:\n\n1. Red Door: The red door is located at coordinates `(3, 2)` based on the observed array (`[4, 0, 1]`, where 4=door, 0=red, 1=closed).\n2. Blue Door: The blue door is located at coordinates `(8, 4)` (`[4, 2, 1]`, where 4=door, 2=blue, 1=closed).\n\nThe agent starts at `(5, 1)` facing left, and the mission requires toggling both doors in sequence. The optimal path will navigate around obstacles and avoid the danger zones marked as `-1`. \n\nTo reach the red door `(3, 2)`:\n- Move up to row `3`.\n- Move right to column `2`.\n\nTo reach the blue door `(8, 4)`:\n- Move down to row `8`.\n- Move right to column `4`.\n\nThe agent will toggle each door upon facing it.\n\n---\n\n### Immediate Next Action:\n1. The agent is at `(5, 1)` facing left.\n2. To move toward `(3, 2)`, the agent needs to **turn left**, as it is currently facing away from the target direction.\n\n---\n\nAnswer: turn_left","### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n#### Mission\nThe agent's task is to open the red door first, then open the blue door.\n\n#### Agent's Position and Goal\nAgent starts at `(5, 1)` facing downward (`↓`).\n- Red door is located at `(8, 4)`.\n- Blue door is located at `(3, 2)`.\n\n#### Observations and Navigation Strategy\n1. **Shortest Path to Red Door**:\n   - The agent faces downward and needs to move to row 8, column 4.\n   - Path: Move downward three cells to row 8, then move right until reaching column 4.\n   - Once in front of the red door, use the `toggle` action to open it.\n\n2. **Shortest Path to Blue Door after Red Door**:\n   - The agent needs to navigate back to the top-left region where the blue door is.\n   - From `(8, 4)` to `(3, 2)`: Move upward to row 3, then adjust horizontally to column 2.\n   - Once in front of the blue door, use the `toggle` action to open it.\n\n#### Core Rules\n1. Avoid obstacles such as walls and lava.\n2. Inventory management does not seem necessary for this mission since the doors are not locked (confirmed via state values from observation).\n3. Use only the provided action list.\n\n#### Immediate Action\nAgent starts at `(5, 1)` facing downward.

We'll focus on locating the blue key and navigating toward it first.\n\nFrom the 3D grid array:\n- The `object_type=5` with `color=2` corresponds to a blue key. I need to find this cell and compute a path.\n\n---\n\nNow, I need to analyze the environment in greater detail (which is a large grid). Since the next action must be clear and specific, **I'll focus on identifying immediate surroundings**.\n\n### Immediate Surroundings:\n- The agent is facing right (→). The cell directly ahead is `(10, 18)`, which must be checked for walls, lava, or other objects.\n- I will also check adjacent cells for obstacles or objects.\n\nLooking at the surroundings:\n- **Cell (10, 18)**: [0, 18, 2] → Empty floor.\n- **Cell (10, 16)**: Safe, already traversed.\n- There's no immediate danger or object of interest.\n\n### Action Plan:\nThe optimal next action is to **move forward** to advance closer to discovering the yellow room and its key.\n\n---\n\n### Final Response:\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve the mission, we need to process the given task step by step: \n\n1. Retrieve the blue key from the yellow room.\n2. Use the blue key to unlock the blue door.\n3. Enter the goal square.\n\nLet’s break this down:\n\n- The observation and mission indicate that our first objective is to find the blue key in the yellow room. Since the agent is positioned at (10, 17) and facing right, the next immediate action is to move closer to the yellow room.\n\nAnalyzing step-by-step:\n\n1. Since the grid and environment were not fully provided, the immediate step the agent will likely take (based on an initial starting move) is advancing toward objects or areas relevant to completing the mission.\n\nImmediate Action:\n\nThe agent can safely “move_forward” toward its target.\n\n---\n\n**Response Output**\n\nAnswer: move_forward","To answer the problem, let us analyze the mission, position of relevant objects, and the agent’s environment based on the provided rules:\n\n### Mission Analysis:\nThe mission is to:\n1.

There wasn’t a specific observation detail provided for individual cells (e.g., contents of each cell). Thus, the key and relevant objects are unclear from the data above.

Explore surroundings relative to the agent’s position to identify the blue key location. For this, `move_forward` is the most straightforward to investigate.\n2. Adjust direction as needed (using `turn_left` or `turn_right`) based on findings.\n\n### Action:\nThe agent is facing right at `(10, 17)`, moving forward is the optimal approach to proceed efficiently and identify objects in sight. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve the mission step-by-step, we need to analyze the grid and decide optimal actions.

Navigate to the goal.\n\nGiven the observation, the grid provided is too abstract to pinpoint exact positions of objects or navigate accurately. Therefore, I can contribute only the decision-making process based on contextual understanding. From the mission specifics:\n\nThe agent starts at position (10, 17) facing right (→). Assuming the shortest path is prioritized:\n\n### Step-by-Step Decision:\nCurrently, the agent is not carrying anything. To start the navigation process:\n\n1. Since the goal is to “get the blue key from the yellow room,” I hypothesize that turning left or right first (and going forward) might be necessary to find the key. Observations must confirm the presence of objects in adjacent squares.\n2. Keys are interactable when the agent faces them directly → ‘pickup’.\n\nGiven limited observations, the position for now suggests direct exploration.\n\n### Initial Action:\nThe agent should move forward.

The full and explicit grid data is necessary to make the decision.\n\n### Immediate Decision:\n\nSince the grid is truncated, and I don’t have explicit localized information (e.g., coordinates of the yellow room, blue key, etc.), my first move needs to involve **exploration or interacting with the nearest identifiable object**.\n\nGiven the current situation, I will optimally **move forward** and try determining more details.\n\n### Action:\n\nAnswer: move_forward","To tackle the problem, we need to analyze the grid and follow the mission 'get the blue key from the yellow room, unlock the blue door and go to the goal' step by step. \n\n### Observations and Analysis:\n1. **Agent position:** The agent is at `(10, 17)` facing **right (→)**, and it starts without carrying anything.\n   \n2. **Key Objective:** The agent needs to:\n   - Navigate to the yellow room and pick up the blue key.\n   - Locate and unlock the blue door using the blue key.\n   - Proceed to the goal square.\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - Avoid lava (`object_type=9`).\n   - Use **pickup** for the key.\n   - Use **toggle** to open closed doors.\n   - Use the matching key from inventory to unlock locked doors.\n\n**Optimal Approach (based on mission):**\nWe will choose the next move based on proximity to the first objective (the blue key in yellow room).\n\nGiven that the observation is summarized and not detailed with object positions, there would be further logic for determining each point's exact calculations dynamically if feasible.\n\nFor this step\/query:\n```text \nLikely answer states optimal-\"forward formatting is missing\"\n","**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Problem:**\n\n1. **Mission Overview:**  \n   The agent's main tasks are:\n   - Go to the yellow room, retrieve the blue key.\n   - Use the key to unlock the blue door.\n   - Reach the goal.\n\n2. **Observation Analysis:**  \n   - Starting point: The agent is at `(10, 17)` facing right (direction `0`).\n   - It is not carrying any items.\n   - The grid consists of cells with specific attributes, but the critical details (locations of the yellow room, blue key, blue door, and goal) are not directly interpretable without an expanded grid description.\n\n3. **Prioritizing Actions**  \n   - To interact with objects (e.g., pick up a key or open a door), the agent must be facing the target. The direction must be adjusted accordingly.\n   - Moving in the shortest path (while avoiding walls\/lava) is key to optimizing steps.\n   - Inventory will play a crucial role for unlocking the blue door.\n\n---\n\nUnfortunately, the current grid snippet does not explicitly show key areas like the yellow room, blue key, or blue door. This makes pathfinding ambiguous without further clarification on relevant locations. For now, I'll assume the immediate action based on the direction the agent is currently facing.\n\n---\n\n**Optimal Action:**\nGiven the agent's position and rule constraints, I'll recommend advancing forward unless we hit an obstruction.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this task:\n\n1. **Goal Decomposition**:\n    - Retrieve the **blue key** from the **yellow room**.\n    - Use the **blue key** to unlock the **blue door**.\n    - Proceed to the goal.\n\n2. **Grid Analysis**:\n    - The agent is currently at position **(10, 17)**, facing right (→).\n    - The blue key and yellow room need to be located in the grid. In this truncated grid portion, additional exploration or information might be required.\n\n3. **Next Move**:\n    - In complex environments, the agent needs to explore systematically while avoiding obstacles or hazards like walls and lava. For now, we assume the solution awaits or requires further steps as information about the grid map isn't parsed completely.\n\n4. **Action**:\n    - Move **forward** tentatively in its initial facing direction (right).\n\n---\n\nThus, the agent action starts as follows:\n\n**Answer: move_forward**","To solve the mission, we'll follow these steps based on the rules and observation:\n\n### Analysis of the Mission:\n1. **Objective 1:** Find the blue key in the yellow room.\n2. **Objective 2:** Unlock the blue door using the blue key.\n3. **Objective 3:** Reach the goal (presumably a square marked with `[8, x, 0]` in the grid).\n\n### Initial Interpretation:\n- **Current Position:** Agent is located at `(10, 17)` facing \"right (→)\" (0).\n- **Status:** The agent is not carrying anything.\n- **Steps Remaining:** The agent has 4 steps left to decide its next action.\n\n### Grid Observations:\n- The agent needs to analyze the environment and navigate strategically:\n  - Yellow Room: Search for areas with `color=4` (yellow).\n  - Blue Key: Match `[5, 2, 0]` (key object type, blue color).\n  - Blue Door: Match `[4, 2, 2]` (door object type, blue color, locked state).\n  - Goal: Match `[8, x, 0]` (goal object type).\n\nSince the array detailing the grid environment is incomplete, I will assume that the next viable action would prioritize moving toward the blue key.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven the incomplete details of the mission-specific grid, the agent's immediate task is to continue moving forward toward the area likely containing the mission objectives (e.g., the yellow room).

Since the agent can move forward without obstacles, this is the optimal action.\n\n### Final Response:\nAnswer: move_forward","### Step 1: Analyze Environmental Observations\nThe mission \"open the door\" implies that I need to toggle the door at (5, 4). The agent is currently at (4, 4) and facing down (`direction=1`). The goal is to move one step forward to face the door and then toggle it to \"open.\"\n\n### Step 2: Plan the Optimal Actions\n1. Check the environment around the agent. \n   - The agent is already facing downwards and the cell (5, 4) contains a door.\n2. Move forward to approach the door.\n3. Use the `toggle` action to open the door.\n\n### Step 3: Execute the First Action\nSince the agent is already facing the correct direction to move towards the door, the optimal first action is `move_forward`.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Let's analyze the grid and the mission.\n\n1. **Agent Location and Facing:** The agent is currently at (4, 4) facing down (↓), which corresponds to direction `1`.\n2. **Mission:** The task is to open the door. The door is located at (5, 4). It is closed (state=1). To open it, the agent is required to face the door and use the action `toggle`.\n\n3. **Path to Goal:**  \n   - The agent is already facing the door row. Moving directly forward will align the agent with the door. \n   - The `toggle` action will open the door.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n1. Move forward from (4, 4) to (5, 4).\n2. Perform the `toggle` action to open the door.\n\n### First Action:\nSince the agent is already facing the door, the first action is:\n\n**Action:** `move_forward`\n\n### Required Response Format:\nAnswer: move_forward","### Analysis:\n\n1. **Mission**: Open the door.\n2. **Agent's Position**: The agent is at (4, 4), facing down (↓).\n3. **Environment**:\n   - The door (object_type=4) is located at (5, 4).\n   - Its state is \"closed\" (`state=1`).\n   - The agent is already facing the door, so moving forward will bring it closer.\n   - No obstacles block the path. \n   - No need for a key or inventory management since the door is not locked.\n\n4. **Optimal Action**:\n   - The agent must move forward to (5, 4) first.\n   - Then, it will use `toggle` to open the door.\n\n### Next Action:\nThe agent should move forward to get closer to the door.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve the mission \"open the door\", we need to analyze the observation grid and determine the optimal action. The agent is currently at position (4, 4), facing downwards (↓). The door is at position (5, 4), as indicated by object_type `4` in the grid. The door is currently closed (state = 1). To open the door, the agent needs to face the door and then use the `toggle` action.\n\n### Action Analysis:\n1. The agent is positioned directly above the door, and it is already facing down (towards the door) at position (5, 4).\n2. Therefore, the agent does not need to move its orientation or position. It can directly interact with the door by using the `toggle` action.\n\n### Action Decision:\nThe optimal action is to use the `toggle` action to open the door.\n\nAnswer: toggle","### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n#### 1. Mission Analysis:\nThe mission is to \"open the door.\" From the grid observation, the door is located at (5, 4) with `state=1` (closed). To open the door, I need to move to a position facing the door and use the `toggle` action.\n\n#### 2. Current Agent Position and Orientation:\nThe agent is at (4, 4), facing down (`direction=1`).\n\n#### 3. Path Analysis:\nSince the agent is already facing down and there is a clear path to the door at (5, 4), it can simply move forward to align itself with the door and then use `toggle`.\n\n#### 4. Optimal Action to Take:\nThe optimal action is `move_forward`, which will position the agent at (5, 4), facing the door.\n\n#### 5. Final Action:\nThe agent will need to proceed with the action described above in sequence.\n\n---\n\nAnswer: move_forward","To complete the mission \"open the door,\" we analyze the observation:\n\n1. The agent's current position is at (4, 4), facing down (↓).\n2. The door is located at (5, 4).\n3. For the agent to interact with the door (toggle it), the agent must face the door directly. Currently, the agent is already facing down toward the door. Therefore, a movement to (5, 4) followed by `toggle` is required.\n\nThe following optimal action is:\n- `move_forward` to move closer to the door.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","To accomplish the mission \"open the door,\" the agent must navigate to the door at position (5, 4) and use the `toggle` action while facing it.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n1. Agent's current position is (4, 4), facing down (↓).\n2. The door to open is directly in front of the agent at (5, 4).\n3. To open the door, the agent can use the `toggle` action immediately because it is facing the door.\n\nSince no movement or adjustments are needed, the next action is:\n\nAnswer: toggle","### Step 1: Analyze Observations\n\n**Agent Info**:\n- Position: (4, 4)\n- Facing: Down (↓)\n\n**Mission**:\n- \"Open the door\"\n\n**Observation**:\n- Door at (5, 4) with state = 1 (closed).\n\n**Path Analysis**:\n- The agent is one cell away from the door in the direction it's facing (down).\n- Since the mission requires the door to be opened, the agent must first move forward to position (5, 4) and then use the `toggle` action.\n\n### Step 2: Choose Optimal Action\n\n1. The shortest path to the door is one cell forward while facing downward.\n2. The next required action after moving forward will be `toggle` to open the door.\n\n### Step 3: Output Action\n\nThe agent's first action here should be to move forward.\n\n**Final Answer**:\nAnswer: move_forward","### Step 1: Analyzing Observations\n- The agent is currently at position `(4, 4)` and faces downward (`↓` or direction index `1`).\n- Nearby, there is a **closed door** at `(5, 4)` denoted by `[4, x, 1]` in the grid.\n- The mission objective, based on the grid and mission description, is to **open the door**.\n\n### Step 2: Determining Optimal Action\n- Since the agent is already aligned and directly facing downward toward the door, no rotations or movement are needed.\n- The optimal next action is to interact with the door to open it. The action to do so is **`toggle`**.\n\n### Step 3: Output in Required Format\nAnswer: toggle","### Analysis of Environment\nThe mission is to open the door.
