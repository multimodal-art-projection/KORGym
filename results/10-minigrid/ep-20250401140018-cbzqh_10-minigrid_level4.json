However, let's double-check the colors:\n- The color for purple is 3. Looking through the grid:\n  - The only door with color=3 is at (0, 2): [0, 2, 4]. But color=2 is blue, not purple (color=3).\n  - There is no door with color=3 (purple) in the grid.\n\nThis suggests that the mission might be impossible to complete as there is no purple door in the grid. However, let's assume there might be a misinterpretation and re-examine the grid.\n\nWait, the grid is given as a 3D array where each cell is [object_type, color, state]. The purple door would have object_type=4 and color=3. Scanning the grid:\n- (0, 2): [0, 2, 4] → object_type=0 (EMPTY), color=2, state=4 (invalid for EMPTY).\n- (3, 0): [3, 0, 4] → object_type=3 (FLOOR), color=0, state=4 (invalid for FLOOR).\n- (3, 4): [3, 4, 4] → object_type=3 (FLOOR), color=4, state=4 (invalid for FLOOR).\n- (5, 2): [5, 2, 4] → object_type=5 (KEY), color=2, state=4 (invalid for KEY).\n- (0, 2): [0, 2, 4] → object_type=0 (EMPTY), color=2, state=4 (invalid for EMPTY).\n\nIt seems there is no door (object_type=4) in the grid at all. This suggests the grid might be incorrectly represented or the mission is unachievable.\n\nGiven this, the only logical conclusion is that the mission cannot be completed, and the agent should take no action. However, since we must provide an action, the safest default action is to not move (but since \"stay\" is not an option, we can choose \"done\" if the goal is already reached, but it's not).\n\nGiven the confusion, the most likely correct interpretation is that the door at (0, 2) is the purple door (color=2 might be a typo and should be 3). Assuming that, the agent needs to reach (0, 2).\n\n### Path to (0, 2):\n1. The agent is at (2, 1), facing up.\n2. To reach (0, 2), the agent needs to move left twice (to (0, 1)) and then up (to (0, 2)).\n3. Currently, the agent is facing up. To move left, it needs to turn left (now facing left) and then move_forward to (1, 1).\n4. From (1, 1), move_forward again to (0, 1).\n5. Then turn_right (now facing up) and move_forward to (0, 2).\n\nHowever, checking the grid:\n- (1, 1): [1, 1, -1] → object_type=1 (WALL), so cannot move to (1, 1).\nAlternative path:\n- Turn left (now facing left), move_forward to (1, 1) → blocked by wall.\n- Turn right (now facing right), move_forward to (3, 1) → [1, 1, -1] (WALL), blocked.\n- Move_forward up to (2, 0) → [2, 0, 2] (WALL), blocked.\nThus, the agent is stuck and cannot move.\n\nGiven this, the only possible action is to turn_left or turn_right, but no movement is possible. The mission cannot be completed.\n\nAnswer: done"],"prompt":"\n    You are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a game board and rules.\n    Your task is:\n    - First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n    - Second, output the answer in the required format.

However, the grid shows mostly empty cells and lava, with no doors or keys to worry about.\n\n### Plan:\n- The agent needs to navigate from (1, 1) to (9, 9) while avoiding lava.\n- The agent is currently facing up (towards (1, 0)), but (1, 0) is a wall, so moving forward is not possible.\n- The agent must turn to face a direction where it can move towards the goal without hitting lava or walls.\n\n### Steps:\n1. The agent is at (1, 1), facing up. The cell in front (1, 0) is a wall, so the agent cannot move forward. It must turn.\n2. Turning right will face the agent to the right (direction 0). The cell to the right is (2, 1), which is lava. Not safe.\n3. Turning left will face the agent to the left (direction 2). The cell to the left is (0, 1), which is a wall. Not safe.\n4. The agent is stuck facing up with no immediate safe moves. It must turn to face down (direction 1) to proceed.\n   - To face down, the agent needs to turn right twice (from up to right, then right to down) or turn left once (from up to left, then left to down). The shortest is to turn right twice or turn left once.\n   - After turning left once, the agent will face left (direction 2), but (0, 1) is a wall.

However, looking at the grid, the only safe path is to move down (direction 1) to (1, 2), but (1, 2) is -1 (empty), which is safe.\n   - Wait: the agent is at (1, 1), facing up (direction 3). The cell in front is (1, 0), which is a wall. The cell behind is (1, 2), which is empty. To move to (1, 2), the agent must turn around to face down (direction 1). This requires two right turns or two left turns.\n   - After turning right twice (up -> right -> down), the agent faces down (direction 1). Then, it can move forward to (1, 2), which is empty and safe.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n1. turn_right (now facing right, direction 0)\n2. turn_right (now facing down, direction 1)\n3. move_forward (move to (1, 2))\n4.

This means the agent's immediate right is (2, 1).\n\n2. **Immediate Right Cell (2, 1)**: This cell contains [2, 1, 9], which translates to object_type=2 (WALL), color=1 (GREEN), state=9 (LAVA). This is dangerous and must be avoided.\n\n3. **Forward Path**: The cell directly in front of the agent (to the right) is (2, 1), which is lava. Moving forward is not safe.\n\n4. **Alternative Paths**:\n   - **Left Turn**: If the agent turns left, it will face upwards (↑). The cell above (1, 0) is [1, 0, 2], which is a WALL (object_type=2). This is not passable.\n   - **Right Turn**: If the agent turns right, it will face downwards (↓). The cell below (1, 2) is [1, 2, -1], which is EMPTY (object_type=1). This is safe to move into.\n\n5. **Path to Goal**: The green goal square is at (3, 3). From (1, 2), the agent can move right to (2, 2), but (2, 2) is lava. Instead, the agent should move down to (1, 3), then right to (2, 3), which is empty, and then right again to (3, 3), the goal.\n\n6. **Optimal Action**: To start this path, the agent should first turn right to face downwards, then move forward to (1, 2).\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n1. Turn right (now facing down).\n2. Move forward to (1, 2).\n3. Move forward to (1, 3).\n4. Turn right (now facing right).\n5. Move forward to (2, 3).\n6. Move forward to (3, 3) (goal).\n\nThe first action in this sequence is to turn right to avoid the lava and face the safe path.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Let's analyze the grid and plan the optimal path to the green goal square while avoiding lava.\n\n1. **Current Position & Orientation**: \n   - Agent is at (1, 1), facing down (↓).\n   - Directly below (1, 2) is empty (-1), so we can move there safely.\n\n2. **Path to Goal**:\n   - The green goal square is at (3, 3).\n   - From (1, 1), the shortest path is: \n     - Move down to (1, 2), \n     - then right to (2, 2) (but this is lava), \n     - so we must go further down to (1, 3), \n     - then right to (2, 3), \n     - then right to (3, 3) (goal).\n\n3. **Avoiding Lava**:\n   - (2, 1) and (2, 2) are lava (9), so we must avoid moving right from (1, 1) or (1, 2).\n\n4. **Next Action**:\n   - Currently facing down, and (1, 2) is safe to move into.\n\nThus, the first action is to move forward into (1, 2).\n\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the agent's current situation step by step.\n\n### Mission Analysis:\n- **Mission**: Avoid the lava and get to the green goal square.\n- **Agent's Position**: (1, 2), facing down (↓).\n- **Goal Position**: (3, 3) (since `object_type=8` is the goal, and its color is green as per the mission).\n- **Obstacles**: Lava is at (2, 1) and (2, 2). Walls surround the grid (object_type=2). The rest are empty or floor spaces (object_type=-1 or 1).\n\n### Path to the Goal:\n1. The agent is at (1, 2), facing down (↓). The cell directly below (1, 3) is empty (object_type=-1), so the agent can move forward to (1, 3).\n2. From (1, 3), the agent can turn right to face left (←) and move to (0, 3), but this is a wall (object_type=2), so this is not viable.\n3. Alternatively, from (1, 3), the agent can turn left to face right (→) and move to (2, 3), which is empty (object_type=-1).\n4. From (2, 3), the agent can move forward to (3, 3), which is the goal.\n\n### Avoiding Lava:\n- The lava is at (2, 1) and (2, 2). The agent must avoid moving into these cells. The path described above does not intersect with the lava.\n\n### Step-by-Step Actions:\n1. **Current Position**: (1, 2), facing down (↓).\n   - Action: `move_forward` to (1, 3).\n2. **Position**: (1, 3), facing down (↓).\n   - Action: `turn_left` to face right (→).\n3. **Position**: (1, 3), facing right (→).\n   - Action: `move_forward` to (2, 3).\n4. **Position**: (2, 3), facing right (→).\n   - Action: `move_forward` to (3, 3), which is the goal.\n   - Action: `done` (mission accomplished).\n\n### Immediate Next Action:\nThe first action is to move forward from (1, 2) to (1, 3).\n\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and determine the optimal path to the green goal square while avoiding lava.\n\n### Grid Analysis:\n1. **Agent Position**: (1, 3), facing down (↓).\n2. **Goal Position**: (3, 3) (green goal square, object_type=8, color=1).\n3. **Obstacles**:\n   - Lava at (2, 1) and (2, 2) (object_type=9).\n   - Walls surround the grid (object_type=2).\n4. **Path to Goal**:\n   - From (1, 3), the agent can move right to (2, 3), then right again to (3, 3) to reach the goal.\n   - The path (1, 3) → (2, 3) → (3, 3) is clear and safe (no lava or walls).\n\n### Steps:\n1. The agent is currently facing down (↓). To move right (toward (2, 3)), it needs to turn right to face right (→).\n2. After turning right, the agent can move forward to (2, 3).\n3. From (2, 3), the agent is already facing right (→), so it can move forward again to (3, 3) to reach the goal.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n1. `turn_right` (to face right).\n2. `move_forward` (to (2, 3)).\n3. `move_forward` (to (3, 3)).\n4. `done` (goal reached).\n\nSince the question asks for the next action, the first step is to turn right to face the correct direction.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Let's analyze the grid and the agent's situation:\n\n1. Current position: (1,3) facing left (←)\n2. Goal position: Green goal square is at (3,3) (object_type=8, color=1)\n3. Obstacles:\n   - Lava at (2,1) and (2,2)\n   - Walls surround the grid (object_type=2)\n4. Path options:\n   - Direct path left would go to (0,3) which is a wall\n   - Safe path: Move down to (1,4) is blocked by wall\n   - Only viable path: Turn right to face down, then move down to (2,3), then right to (3,3)\n\nOptimal sequence:\n1. First turn right to face down (↓)\n2. Then move forward to (2,3)\n3. Then turn right to face right (→)\n4. Then move forward to (3,3) - the goal\n\nFirst action needed: turn_right\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Let's analyze the grid and plan the optimal path to the green goal square while avoiding lava.\n\n1. Current Position: Agent is at (1, 3) facing up (↑)\n2. Goal Position: Green goal square is at (3, 3) (object_type=8, color=1)\n3. Obstacles:\n   - Lava at (2,1) and (2,2)\n   - Walls surround the grid (object_type=2)\n4. Path options:\n   - Direct path would be right twice to (3,3) but we must check for obstacles\n   - From (1,3), moving right would go to (2,3) which is empty (-1)\n   - Then from (2,3), moving right would go to (3,3) which is the goal\n\nThe path is clear with no obstacles or lava in the way. Since the agent is facing up, we need to:\n1. First turn right to face right (→)\n2. Then move forward to (2,3)\n3. Then move forward again to reach the goal at (3,3)\n\nFirst action should be turning right to face the correct direction.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Let me analyze the situation and determine the optimal path to the green goal square while avoiding lava.\n\n1. Current Position: Agent is at (1,3) facing right (→)\n2. Goal Location: Green goal square is at (3,3) (object_type=8, color=1)\n3. Obstacles:\n   - Lava is at (2,1) and (2,2)\n   - Walls surround the grid (object_type=2)\n4. Path Analysis:\n   - From (1,3), the agent can move right to (2,3)\n   - From (2,3), the agent can move up to (2,2) but that's lava (must avoid)\n   - From (2,3), the agent can move down to (2,4) but that's a wall\n   - From (2,3), the agent can move right to (3,3) which is the goal\n\nThe optimal path is:\n1. Move forward to (2,3)\n2. Turn right to face down (but this would face a wall)\n3. Actually, after moving to (2,3), the agent can just move right again to reach (3,3)\n\nWait, let's verify:\n- After first move_forward, agent would be at (2,3) still facing right\n- Then another move_forward would take agent to (3,3) which is the goal\n\nNo need to turn, just two move_forward actions will reach the goal while avoiding lava.\n\nFirst action should be move_forward to (2,3).\n\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the agent's current situation step by step.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Grid:\n- The grid is 5x5, with coordinates (0,0) at the top-left and (4,4) at the bottom-right.\n- The agent is at position (2, 3), facing right (→).\n- The agent is not carrying anything.\n- The mission is to \"avoid the lava and get to the green goal square.\"\n\n### 2. Identifying Key Elements:\n- **Agent Position (2, 3)**: The agent is facing right (direction 0).\n- **Goal Position**: The green goal square is at (3, 3) (object_type=8, color=1 (green)).\n- **Lava Positions**: There is lava at (2, 1) and (2, 2) (object_type=9).\n- **Walls**: The grid is surrounded by walls (object_type=2), and there are some internal walls or obstacles marked with [-1, -1, -1].\n\n### 3. Path to the Goal:\n- The agent is at (2, 3), facing right. The goal is at (3, 3), which is directly to the right of the agent.\n- The cell to the right of the agent (3, 3) is the goal, and it is not blocked by any walls or lava.\n- The agent can move forward to reach the goal in one step.\n\n### 4. Avoiding Lava:\n- The lava is at (2, 1) and (2, 2), which are not in the immediate path to the goal. The agent does not need to interact with or avoid lava in this step since the path to the goal is clear.\n\n### 5. Action:\n- The agent is already facing the goal (right).

The first action is `turn_left`.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the agent's current position to determine the optimal path to the grey box.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Agent Position and Orientation**:\n   - The agent is at (3, 3), facing up (direction = 3).\n   - The grid is 6x6, with coordinates from (0,0) to (5,5).\n\n2. **Grey Box Location**:\n   - The grey box is represented by `[7, 5, 0]` (object_type=7 for BOX, color=5 for GREY).\n   - From the grid, the grey boxes are located at:\n     - (2, 2): `[7, 5, 0]`\n     - (2, 3): `[7, 5, 0]`\n\n3. **Path to the Grey Box**:\n   - The agent is at (3, 3), and the closest grey box is at (2, 3), which is directly to the left of the agent (since (3-1, 3) = (2, 3)).\n   - The agent is currently facing up, so it needs to turn left to face left (direction=2) to move towards (2, 3).\n\n4. **Obstacles**:\n   - The cell to the left of the agent (2, 3) is a grey box, so no obstacles are in the way.\n   - The agent can move forward after turning left to reach the grey box.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Turn left to face left (direction=2).\n2. Move forward to reach (2, 3), where the grey box is located.\n\n### Answer:\nThe first action is to turn left to face the grey box.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the agent's current position to determine the optimal path to the grey box.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Agent Position and Orientation**:\n   - The agent is at (3, 3), facing left (←).\n   - The agent is not carrying anything.\n\n2. **Grey Box Location**:\n   - The grey box is located at (2, 2) and (2, 3). The box at (2, 2) has `object_type=7` (BOX) and `color=5` (GREY), which matches the mission.\n   - The box at (2, 3) also has `object_type=7` (BOX) but its color is not specified in the observation (default is likely not grey, as the grey box is explicitly mentioned at (2, 2)).\n\n3. **Path to the Grey Box**:\n   - From the agent's current position (3, 3), facing left, the immediate cell to the left is (3, 2). The observation shows `[3, -1, -1]` at (3, 2), which is likely a walkable floor (since `object_type=3` is FLOOR).\n   - Moving left to (3, 2) would bring the agent closer to the grey box at (2, 2).\n   - From (3, 2), the agent can move up to (2, 2) to reach the grey box.\n\n### Steps:\n1. The agent is already facing left (←), so no turning is needed initially.\n2. Move forward to (3, 2).\n3. Turn left (to face up, ↑) since the agent was facing left (←), and turning left would make it face down (↓). Wait, no: the agent's direction is left (←), and turning left would make it face down (↓). But the grey box is at (2, 2), which is up (↑) relative to (3, 2). So the agent needs to turn right to face up (↑).\n   - Correction: The agent's direction is left (←), which corresponds to direction=2 (left). Turning right would make it face up (direction=3, up). This is correct because the grey box is at (2, 2), which is up relative to (3, 2).\n4. Move forward to (2, 2) to reach the grey box.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nThe agent is at (3, 3), facing left (←), and the cell to the left (3, 2) is walkable. The first action is to move forward to (3, 2).\n\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the agent's current position to determine the optimal path to the grey box.\n\n1. **Agent Position and Orientation**:\n   - The agent is at (3, 3), facing left (←).\n   - The grey box is located at (2, 2) and (2, 3). Since the agent is at (3, 3), the closest grey box is at (2, 3), which is directly to the left of the agent.\n\n2. **Path to the Grey Box**:\n   - The agent is already facing left (←), so it can move directly to (2, 3) by moving forward.\n   - The cell to the left (2, 3) contains a grey box (object_type=7, color=5 (GREY)), which is the target.\n\n3. **Action**:\n   - Since the agent is facing the grey box and the path is clear (no walls or obstacles), the optimal action is to `move_forward` to reach the grey box.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this problem, let's analyze the given grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Analysis:\n- **Mission**: \"go to the grey box\"\n- **Agent Position**: (3, 3), facing left (←)\n- **Grey Box Location**: The grey box is represented by `[7, 5, 0]` (object_type=7 for BOX, color=5 for GREY). From the grid, the grey boxes are located at:\n  - (2, 2)\n  - (2, 3)\n\n### Path to the Grey Box:\nThe agent is at (3, 3), facing left. The closest grey box is at (2, 3), which is directly to the left of the agent (same row, one column to the left). \n\n### Action Plan:\n1. The agent is already facing left (towards (2, 3)), so no turning is needed.\n2. Move forward to reach (2, 3), which is the grey box.\n\n### Verification:\n- The cell to the left of the agent (3, 3) is (3, 2), which is `[3, -1, -1]`. This seems to be a FLOOR (object_type=3) with no obstacles, so the agent can move forward to (3, 2).\n- However, the grey box is at (2, 3), not (3, 2). There seems to be a misunderstanding here. The agent is at (3, 3), and (2, 3) is one row above (since the grid is 6x6 with (0,0) at the top-left). The agent is facing left (direction=2), which corresponds to decreasing the column index (moving left in the same row). So, moving left from (3, 3) would take the agent to (3, 2), not (2, 3).\n- The grey box at (2, 3) is actually one row above the agent's current row. To reach it, the agent needs to:\n  1. Turn left to face up (since the agent is currently facing left, turning left will make it face down, which is incorrect. Actually, turning right would make it face up).\n  2. Move forward to (2, 3).\n\nBut looking at the grid, (2, 3) is `[7, 5, 0]` (grey box), and (3, 2) is `[3, -1, -1]` (floor). The mission is to go to the grey box, which is at (2, 3). \n\n### Correct Action:\nThe agent is at (3, 3), facing left. To reach (2, 3):\n1. Turn right to face up (since the agent is facing left, turning right will make it face up).\n2. Move forward to (2, 3).\n\nBut since we can only output one action at a time, the first action is to turn right to face up.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the agent's current position to determine the optimal path to the grey box.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Agent's Position and Orientation**:\n   - The agent is at (3, 3), facing up (↑).\n   - The agent is not carrying anything.\n\n2. **Grey Box Location**:\n   - The grey box is represented by `[7, 5, 0]` (object_type=7, color=5 (GREY), state=0).\n   - From the grid, the grey boxes are located at:\n     - (2, 2): `[7, 5, 0]`\n     - (2, 3): `[7, 5, 0]`\n   - The closest grey box to the agent is at (2, 2) or (2, 3), both 1 cell away.\n\n3. **Path to the Grey Box**:\n   - The agent is at (3, 3), facing up. To reach (2, 3), the agent can:\n     - Move forward (up) to (2, 3), which is a grey box.\n   - Alternatively, to reach (2, 2), the agent would need to:\n     - Turn left (to face left), then move forward to (2, 3), then turn left (to face down), then move forward to (2, 2).\n     - This is longer, so the optimal path is to move forward to (2, 3).\n\n4. **Obstacles**:\n   - The cell directly in front of the agent (up) at (2, 3) is a grey box (`[7, 5, 0]`), which is the target. No obstacles are in the way.\n\n### Action:\n- The agent should `move_forward` to reach the grey box at (2, 3).\n\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this problem, let's analyze the given grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission:\n- **Mission:** \"go to the grey box\"\n- **Agent Position:** (3, 2), facing up (↑)\n- **Agent Status:** Not carrying anything\n- **Steps Remaining:** 94\n\n### Grid Analysis:\nThe grid is a 6x6 matrix where each cell is represented by `[object_type, color, state]`. \n\n1. **Agent Position (3, 2):** \n   - `[10, 3, 0]`: The agent is here, facing up (direction 3 = up).\n\n2. **Grey Boxes:**\n   - Grey color is represented by `5`.\n   - There are two grey boxes at positions:\n     - (2, 2): `[7, 5, 0]` (BOX, GREY)\n     - (2, 3): `[7, 5, 0]` (BOX, GREY)\n\n3. **Obstacles and Path:**\n   - The agent is at (3, 2), facing up. The cell directly in front (up) is (3, 1), which is `[3, -1, -1]`. This seems to be a FLOOR (object_type 3) and is passable.\n   - The grey boxes are at (2, 2) and (2, 3). The closest one is (2, 2), which is to the left of the agent's current position.\n\n### Path to the Grey Box:\n- The agent is at (3, 2), and the closest grey box is at (2, 2).\n- To reach (2, 2), the agent needs to:\n  1. Move forward (up) to (3, 1).\n  2. Turn left (now facing left).\n  3. Move forward to (2, 1).\n  4. Turn right (now facing down).\n  5. Move forward to (2, 2) to reach the grey box.\n\nHowever, looking at the grid:\n- (3, 1) is `[3, -1, -1]` (FLOOR), so the agent can move there.\n- (2, 1) is `[2, -1, -1]` (WALL), which is impassable. This means the path above is blocked by a wall at (2, 1).\n\nAlternative path:\n1. Turn left (now facing left).\n2. Move forward to (2, 2) directly, where the grey box is located.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- The agent is at (3, 2), facing up. The grey box is at (2, 2), which is to the left.\n- The agent can turn left to face left (direction 2), then move forward to (2, 2).\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe optimal action is to turn left first to face the grey box, then move forward in the next step.

From the observation, we need to locate the grey box (object_type=7, color=5 (GREY)).\n\n### Grid Analysis:\n1. **Agent Position**: The agent is at (3, 2), facing left (←). The agent's direction is left (2, as per the color\/direction mapping for AGENT).\n2. **Box Locations**: \n   - There are two boxes at (2, 2) and (2, 3). \n   - The color of these boxes is not explicitly given in the observation, but the object_type is 7 (BOX), and the color is not specified in the provided data. However, the mission specifies a \"grey box,\" so we assume one of these is grey.\n   - From the observation, the boxes are at (2, 2) and (2, 3). The color is not directly visible, but since the mission specifies a grey box, we can assume one of them is grey. For simplicity, let's assume (2, 2) is the grey box (this is a reasonable assumption since the grid doesn't provide color details for boxes).\n\n### Path to the Grey Box:\n- The agent is at (3, 2), facing left.

All boxes are blue.\n\n### Observation:\n- The grid does not contain any grey boxes. All boxes are blue (color=2). This suggests that the mission cannot be completed as there is no grey box to go to.\n\n### Possible Actions:\nGiven that there is no grey box in the grid, the agent cannot complete the mission. However, the agent can still move towards the nearest box (blue) as a fallback, but this does not satisfy the mission.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the mission is impossible to complete (no grey box exists), the agent cannot take any valid action to achieve the mission.

This means the agent is pointing towards the left side of the grid (towards (0, 1)).\n\n2. **Goal Position**:\n   - The green goal square is at (7, 1) (object_type=8, color=1). \n\n3. **Obstacles and Path**:\n   - The agent is currently at (1, 1). To the left of the agent is a wall (object_type=2 at (0, 1)), so the agent cannot move left.\n   - The agent can move forward (left) but is blocked by a wall. The only other immediate option is to turn right or left to change direction.\n   - The path to the goal involves moving right (towards increasing x-coordinates) since the goal is at (7, 1). The agent must first turn right to face right (→), then move forward to (2, 1), and continue moving right until reaching the goal at (7, 1).\n   - Along the path from (1, 1) to (7, 1), there are lava tiles at (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), which must be avoided. The agent must find a way around these lava tiles. However, the observation shows \"-1\" for many cells, which likely indicates empty or passable tiles (e.g., (1, 2), (1, 3), etc.), but the exact layout is unclear due to the \"-1\" values. Assuming the agent can move down to avoid lava, but the goal is directly to the right, so the agent must find a way to bypass the lava.\n\n4. **Immediate Action**:\n   - The agent is facing left but cannot move left (blocked by wall). The first step is to turn right to face right (→), then move forward to (2, 1). From there, the agent can continue moving right while avoiding lava.\n\n### Optimal Action:\n1. Turn right to face right (→).\n2. Move forward to (2, 1).\n3.

The only safe direction to move is to the right (east), but the agent is facing up. So, the agent must first turn to face right.\n   - After turning right, the agent can move forward to (2, 1), then continue moving right to (6, 1), avoiding the lava.\n   - From (6, 1), the agent can move up to (7, 1) to reach the goal.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Turn Right**: The agent is facing up and needs to face right to move east.\n2. **Move Forward**: Move right to (2, 1), (3, 1) is lava, so the agent must continue moving right to (6, 1).\n3. **Move Up**: From (6, 1), move up to (7, 1) to reach the goal.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nThe agent is facing up and cannot move forward (blocked by a wall).

The best immediate action is to move forward (right) to (5, 4), which is safe.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: move_forward","Let me analyze the grid and plan the path to the green goal square.\n\n1. Current Position: Agent is at (5,4) facing right (→)\n2. Goal Location: Green goal square is at (7,1) (object_type=8, color=1)\n3. Obstacles:\n   - Lava (object_type=9) at several positions including (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)\n   - Walls surround the grid\n\nPath Analysis:\n- Direct path to goal is blocked by lava at (5,1)\n- Need to go around the lava field\n- From (5,4), we can:\n  1. Move left to (4,4)\n  2. Move up to (4,3)\n  3. Move left to (3,3)\n  4. Move up to (3,2)\n  5. Move right to (4,2) - but this is lava, so invalid\n  6. Alternative: from (3,2), move right to (4,2) is lava, so need another path\n  7. Better path: from (5,4), move left to (4,4), then up to (4,3), then left to (3,3), then up to (3,2), then left to (2,2), then up to (2,1), then right to (3,1) - but (3,1) is lava\n  8. Best safe path: from (5,4), move left to (4,4), then up to (4,3), then left to (3,3), then up to (3,2), then right to (4,2) - but (4,2) is lava (invalid)\n  9.

The agent needs to reach this position while avoiding lava.\n\n3. **Path to the Goal**:\n   - From (7, 1), the agent can move down to (7, 2), then (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), and finally (7, 7).\n   - Checking the cells along this path:\n     - (7, 2): Empty (object_type -1, which seems to be walkable based on the grid structure)\n     - (7, 3): Empty\n     - (7, 4): Empty (note: column 4 has lava in rows 1-6, but row 7 is empty)\n     - (7, 5): Empty\n     - (7, 6): Empty\n     - (7, 7): Goal (object_type 8, color 1 (green))\n   - The path is clear and safe (no lava or obstacles).\n\n4. **Current Action**: The agent is facing down, and the cell directly below (7, 2) is empty and safe to move into.\n\n5. **Optimal Action**: The agent should move forward (down) to (7, 2) to start progressing toward the goal.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the agent's current situation step by step.\n\n### Mission:\n- Avoid the lava and get to the green goal square.\n\n### Agent's Current Position and Orientation:\n- Position: (7, 2)\n- Facing: down (↓)\n- Not carrying anything.\n\n### Goal Position:\n- The green goal square is at (7, 7) (object_type=8, color=1).\n\n### Path Analysis:\n1. The agent is at (7, 2), facing down.\n2. Directly below the agent (at (7, 3)) is an empty cell (object_type=-1, which seems to represent FLOOR or walkable space).\n3. The goal is at (7, 7), which is 4 cells down from the agent's current position.\n4. There is no lava or obstacles between (7, 3) and (7, 7). The lava is located in the middle columns (columns 1-6, row 4), which is not in the agent's path.\n5. The agent can move straight down to reach the goal without any obstructions.\n\n### Steps to Reach the Goal:\n1. The agent is already facing down, so no need to turn.\n2. Move forward 5 times to reach the goal:\n   - From (7, 2) to (7, 3)\n   - From (7, 3) to (7, 4)\n   - From (7, 4) to (7, 5)\n   - From (7, 5) to (7, 6)\n   - From (7, 6) to (7, 7) (goal)\n\nHowever, looking at the grid:\n- (7, 4) is object_type=-1 (walkable), but (7, 4) is adjacent to lava in other columns. The agent can safely move through (7, 4) as long as it doesn't step into the lava cells (which are in columns 1-6 at row 4).\n- The path from (7, 2) to (7, 7) is clear and safe.\n\n### Next Action:\nSince the agent is facing down and the path is clear, the optimal next action is `move_forward`.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the agent's current situation step by step.\n\n### 1. **Agent's Current Position and Orientation**:\n   - The agent is at position (7, 3), facing down (↓).\n   - The agent is not carrying anything.\n\n### 2. **Goal**:\n   - The mission is to \"get to the green goal square.\"\n   - From the grid, the green goal square is at position (7, 7) (object_type=8, color=1=GREEN).\n\n### 3. **Path to the Goal**:\n   - The agent is at (7, 3), and the goal is at (7, 7). The direct path is downward (same column, increasing row).\n   - The cells between the agent and the goal are:\n     - (7, 4): Empty (object_type=-1, which seems to be a placeholder for empty or walkable space).\n     - (7, 5): Empty.\n     - (7, 6): Empty.\n     - (7, 7): Goal.\n   - There are no obstacles (walls, locked doors, or lava) on this path. The lava is in other columns (e.g., (1,4), (2,4), etc.), so it doesn't block the path.\n\n### 4. **Actions Needed**:\n   - The agent is already facing down (toward the goal), so no turning is needed.\n   - The agent can move forward to (7, 4), then (7, 5), then (7, 6), and finally (7, 7) to reach the goal.\n\n### 5. **Next Action**:\n   - The next action is to move forward toward the goal.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the agent's current situation:\n\n1. **Agent Position and Orientation**: The agent is at (7, 4), facing down (↓). This means the cell directly below the agent is (7, 5).\n\n2. **Goal Position**: The green goal square is at (7, 7), which is directly to the right of the agent's current position (since the agent is facing down, right is relative to the current orientation). \n\n3. **Path Analysis**:\n   - The agent cannot move forward (down) because (7, 5) is lava (object_type=9).\n   - The agent needs to turn right to face left (relative to current down orientation, which would be towards the right side of the grid) to move towards the goal.\n   - After turning right, the agent will be facing left (←), and can then move forward to reach (7, 7), the goal.\n\n4. **Obstacles**: There are no doors or keys to worry about in this path. The only obstacle is the lava directly below the agent, which we avoid by not moving forward initially.\n\n**Optimal Actions**:\n1. `turn_right` to face left (←).\n2. `move_forward` to reach (7, 7), the green goal square.\n\nSince we can only output one action at a time, the first action is `turn_right`.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the agent's current situation:\n\n1. **Agent Position and Orientation**: The agent is at (7, 4), facing left (←). This means the cell to its immediate left is (6, 4), which contains lava (object_type 9). Moving forward would be dangerous.\n\n2. **Goal Position**: The green goal square (object_type 8, color 1) is at (7, 7). This is to the right of the agent's current position.\n\n3. **Path to Goal**: \n   - From (7, 4), the agent needs to move right to reach (7, 7).\n   - Currently facing left, the agent must turn around to face right before moving forward.\n\n4. **Obstacles**: \n   - The path directly right from (7,4) to (7,7) is clear (all cells between are empty or contain the goal).\n   - No doors, keys, or other obstacles are present in this path.\n\n5. **Action Sequence**:\n   - First, turn right to change orientation from left (←) to down (↓). But this isn't directly towards the goal.\n   - Alternatively, turning right twice (or left twice) will make the agent face right (→), which is the desired direction.\n   - Then, move forward three times to reach the goal.\n\nGiven the immediate need to avoid lava and reorient towards the goal, the first action should be to turn right to start changing direction.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. The agent is at position (7,4) facing up (direction=3)\n2. The green goal is at (7,7) - which is to the right relative to the agent's current position\n3.

The path to the right (towards the goal) appears clear\n\nOptimal path:\n- First turn right to face the goal direction\n- Then move forward towards the goal\n\nThe first action should be to turn right to face the goal direction (east\/right).\n\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the agent's current position to determine the optimal path to the green goal square while avoiding lava.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Agent Position and Orientation**:\n   - The agent is at (7, 4), facing right (→).\n   - The green goal square is at (7, 7), which is directly to the right of the agent's current position.\n\n2. **Obstacles and Path**:\n   - The cell directly in front of the agent (to the right at (7, 5)) is empty (object_type -1), so the agent can move forward.\n   - The next cell after that (7, 6) is also empty, so the agent can move forward again.\n   - The cell at (7, 7) is the green goal square (object_type 8, color 1), so the agent can reach it by moving forward twice.\n\n3. **Lava Avoidance**:\n   - There is lava (object_type 9) in the column at x=1 to x=6, y=4, but this is not in the agent's path to the goal.\n\n### Steps to Reach the Goal:\n1. **First Move**: `move_forward` to (7, 5).\n2. **Second Move**: `move_forward` to (7, 6).\n3. **Third Move**: `move_forward` to (7, 7), which is the goal. At this point, the agent can perform `done`.\n\nSince the agent is already facing the correct direction (right), no turning is needed. The shortest path is to move forward three times, but the third move will land the agent on the goal, so we can stop after the second move and perform `done` when reaching the goal.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe agent should move forward twice to reach the goal. However, since the goal is at (7, 7), the agent can move forward twice and then perform `done` on the third step (but the third step is the goal itself, so `done` is the correct action after the second move). \n\nBut in the grid, the agent is at (7, 4), and the goal is at (7, 7), so the agent needs to move forward three times (to (7, 5), (7, 6), and then (7, 7)). On the third move, the agent reaches the goal, so the action is `done`.\n\nHowever, the grid shows that (7, 5) and (7, 6) are empty (-1), and (7, 7) is the goal (8). So the sequence is:\n1. `move_forward` to (7, 5)\n2. `move_forward` to (7, 6)\n3. `move_forward` to (7, 7) and then `done`.\n\nBut since the agent can only perform one action at a time, the first action is `move_forward`.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Let's analyze the situation:\n\n1.

There's lava in column 4, but the agent is safely positioned away from it\n\nThe optimal path is straightforward:\n- Move forward three times to reach the goal at (7,7)\n\nSince the agent is already facing the correct direction (right), we can immediately start moving forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this problem, let's analyze the game board and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission:\n- Avoid the lava and get to the green goal square.\n\n### Agent's Current Position and Orientation:\n- Agent is at (7, 4), facing right (→).\n- The agent is not carrying anything.\n\n### Observation of the Grid:\n1. The agent is on the right edge of the grid (x=7, y=4), facing right. Directly to the right of the agent (at (8,4)) is a wall (object_type=2), so the agent cannot move forward.\n2. The green goal square is at (7,7), which is to the right and slightly down from the agent's current position. The agent is facing right, so the goal is diagonally down-right.\n3. There is lava (object_type=9) in the same column (y=4) from x=1 to x=6, but the agent is at x=7, so the lava is not directly in the path to the goal.\n4. The path to the goal seems clear if the agent can turn and move appropriately.\n\n### Steps to Reach the Goal:\n1. The agent is facing right, but cannot move forward (wall at (8,4)). \n2. To reach the goal at (7,7), the agent needs to move down (increase y-coordinate). \n3. The agent should:\n   - First, turn right (to face down, since current direction is right (0), turning right changes direction to down (1)).\n   - Then, move forward three times to reach y=7 (from y=4 to y=7).\n   - The goal is at (7,7), so the agent can then perform the \"done\" action.\n\n### Potential Issues:\n- The grid shows that the cells at (7,5), (7,6), and (7,7) are marked as \"-1\" (likely empty or floor), so the path is clear.\n- No doors, keys, or other obstacles are in the way.\n\n### Optimal Action Sequence:\n1. Turn right (to face down).\n2. Move forward (to (7,5)).\n3. Move forward (to (7,6)).\n4. Move forward (to (7,7)).\n5.

Since the ball is directly in front of the agent, we can pick it up immediately.\n\n4. **Action**:\n   - The agent is facing the ball, so the correct action is `pickup`.\n\n### Answer:\nAnswer: pickup","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission: Pick up the blue ball\n\n1. **Agent Position and Orientation**:\n   - The agent is at (4, 2), facing down (↓).\n   - The blue ball is located at (6, 3), which is two cells to the right and one cell down from the agent's current position.\n\n2. **Path to the Blue Ball**:\n   - From (4, 2), the agent needs to move right to (5, 2), then right again to (6, 2), and then down to (6, 3) to reach the blue ball.\n   - The cell at (5, 2) is a wall (object_type=2), so the agent cannot move directly right from (4, 2) to (5, 2). This path is blocked.\n   - Alternative path: The agent can move down to (4, 3), then right to (5, 3), then right to (6, 3). \n     - (4, 3) is empty (object_type=-1), so the agent can move down to (4, 3).\n     - (5, 3) is a door (object_type=4). The door's state is not specified, but assuming it is open or can be toggled, the agent can pass through it.\n     - (6, 3) is the blue ball (object_type=6), so the agent can pick it up.\n\n3. **Actions**:\n   - First, the agent is facing down, so it can move forward to (4, 3).\n   - Then, the agent needs to turn right to face right (→) to move towards (5, 3).\n   - Move forward to (5, 3). If the door is closed, the agent may need to toggle it.\n   - Then, move forward to (6, 3) and pick up the blue ball.\n\n### Immediate Next Action:\nThe agent is currently at (4, 2), facing down (↓). The first step is to move forward to (4, 3).\n\nAnswer: move_forward","To analyze the game board and determine the optimal action to pick up the blue ball, let's break down the observation:\n\n1. **Agent Position and Orientation**: The agent is at (4, 3), facing down (↓). This means the cell directly below the agent is (4, 4).\n\n2. **Blue Ball Location**: The blue ball (object_type=6, color=2 for blue) is located at (6, 3). \n\n3. **Path to the Blue Ball**:\n   - From (4, 3), the agent can move forward (down) to (4, 4), but this is not helpful since the ball is to the right.\n   - The agent needs to turn right to face right (→), then move forward to (5, 3). However, (5, 3) is a closed door (object_type=4, state=1 for closed). The agent cannot pass through a closed door without toggling it first, but the agent does not have a key to unlock it (if it were locked). \n   - Alternatively, the agent can turn left to face left (←), but this would move away from the ball.\n   - The best immediate action is to turn right to face right (→), then move forward to (5, 3), and then toggle the door to open it. However, since the door is closed (not locked), the agent can toggle it without a key.\n\n4. **Immediate Action**: The agent should turn right to face the direction of the blue ball (right\/→). \n\nThus, the first action is to turn right. \n\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the agent's current position to determine the optimal sequence of actions to pick up the blue ball.\n\n### Observation Analysis:\n1. **Agent Position and Orientation**: The agent is at (4, 3), facing left (←). This means the agent is looking towards decreasing x-coordinates (west direction).\n2. **Blue Ball Location**: The blue ball is at (6, 3), which is two cells to the right of the agent's current position. The ball's representation is `[6, 2, 0]` (object_type=6 for BALL, color=2 for BLUE, state=0).\n3. **Obstacles**: \n   - There is a wall (`[5, 3, 4]`) at (5, 3), directly to the left of the agent. This is a door (object_type=4), but since the agent is not carrying anything and the door is not locked (state=1 for closed, not 2 for locked), it can be opened with a `toggle` action if needed. However, the ball is to the right, so this door is irrelevant for now.\n   - The path to the right (towards the ball) is clear from (4, 3) to (6, 3), as the cells at (5, 3) and (6, 3) are not walls or other obstacles (the door at (5, 3) is closed but not in the path to the ball).\n\n### Plan:\n1. The agent is currently facing left, but the ball is to the right. So, the first action should be to turn around to face the ball.\n   - Turning left or right twice would face the agent right. Since the agent is facing left (direction=2), turning right once would face it up (direction=3), and turning right again would face it right (direction=0). Alternatively, turning left once would face it down (direction=1), and turning left again would face it right (direction=0). Either way, two turns are needed to face right.\n   - The most straightforward is to `turn_right` twice.\n2. After facing right, the agent can `move_forward` twice to reach (6, 3), where the blue ball is located.\n3. Finally, the agent can `pickup` the blue ball.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n1. `turn_right` (now facing up)\n2. `turn_right` (now facing right)\n3. `move_forward` (from (4, 3) to (5, 3))\n4. `move_forward` (from (5, 3) to (6, 3))\n5. `pickup` (collect the blue ball)\n\nHowever, the grid shows that (5, 3) is a closed door (`[4, 3, 1]`). Since the agent is not carrying anything, it cannot open the door (doors require a key to unlock if locked, or `toggle` to open if closed). But the mission is to pick up the blue ball, which is at (6, 3), and the door is at (5, 3). The agent can move to (5, 3) and `toggle` the door to open it, then proceed to (6, 3) to `pickup` the ball.\n\nRevised Action Sequence:\n1. `turn_right` (now facing up)\n2. `turn_right` (now facing right)\n3. `move_forward` (from (4, 3) to (5, 3))\n4. `toggle` (open the door at (5, 3))\n5. `move_forward` (from (5, 3) to (6, 3))\n6. `pickup` (collect the blue ball)\n\nBut looking again, the door at (5, 3) is actually a wall (`[5, 3, 4]` is a door, but the agent is at (4, 3), and (5, 3) is to the right. The path to the ball is clear because the ball is at (6, 3), and (5, 3) is a door that can be toggled open. So the agent can move to (5, 3), toggle the door, then move to (6, 3) and pickup the ball.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe first action is to turn right to face the ball.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the agent's current position to determine the optimal sequence of actions to pick up the blue ball.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Agent Position and Orientation**:\n   - The agent is at (4, 3), facing up (↑).\n   - The blue ball is located at (6, 3), which is two cells to the right of the agent's current position.\n\n2. **Path to the Blue Ball**:\n   - From (4, 3), the agent needs to move right twice to reach (6, 3).\n   - Currently, the agent is facing up, so it must first turn right to face right (→), then move forward twice to reach the blue ball.\n\n3. **Obstacles**:\n   - There are no walls, doors, or other obstacles between the agent and the blue ball, so the path is clear.\n\n4. **Actions Required**:\n   - Turn right to face right (→).\n   - Move forward to (5, 3).\n   - Move forward to (6, 3).\n   - Pick up the blue ball.\n\n### Step-by-Step Actions:\n1. `turn_right`: The agent is facing up; turning right will make it face right (→).\n2. `move_forward`: Move to (5, 3).\n3. `move_forward`: Move to (6, 3).\n4. `pickup`: Pick up the blue ball at (6, 3).\n\n### Next Action:\nThe first action in this sequence is `turn_right` to align the agent's direction with the path to the blue ball.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission: Pick up the blue ball\n1. **Agent Position and Orientation**: The agent is at (4, 3), facing right (→).\n2. **Blue Ball Location**: The blue ball is at (6, 3).

The agent is facing right, so the door at (5, 3) is directly in front.\n2. The agent should try to move forward to (5, 3). If the door is closed, the agent will need to toggle it open first. If the door is locked, the mission cannot be completed without a key (but no keys are visible in the observation).\n3. Assuming the door is closed but not locked, the agent should:\n   - First, `toggle` the door to open it.\n   - Then, `move_forward` to (5, 3).\n   - Then, `move_forward` again to (6, 3).\n   - Finally, `pickup` the blue ball.\n\nHowever, since the observation does not specify the door's state, the safest first action is to attempt to `move_forward` to (5, 3).

The blue ball is located at (6, 3). This is directly to the right of the agent's current position (4, 3), two cells away.\n2. The path from the agent to the blue ball:\n   - The cell immediately to the right of the agent (5, 3) has object_type=4 (DOOR), color=2 (BLUE), and state=2 (LOCKED).

Assuming this is a typo and the door is closed or locked, we need to interact with it.\n   - After the door, the next cell is (6, 3), where the blue ball is located.\n\n### Steps to Achieve the Mission:\n1. **Move to the Door**: The agent is already facing the door at (5, 3). \n   - If the door is closed, the agent can `toggle` it to open it.\n   - If the door is locked, the agent would need a key, but there is no key in the observation, so this is likely not the case.\n   - Since the state is 4 (unusual), we'll assume the door is closed and can be toggled open.\n2. **Open the Door**: Use `toggle` to open the door.\n3. **Move to the Ball**: After opening the door, move forward to (6, 3).\n4. **Pick Up the Ball**: Use `pickup` to collect the blue ball.\n\n### Immediate Next Action:\nThe agent is facing the door at (5, 3). The first action is to `toggle` the door to open it.\n\nAnswer: toggle","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission:\n- **Pick up the blue ball**\n\n### Agent's Current Position and Orientation:\n- **Position**: (4, 3)\n- **Facing**: Right (→)\n\n### Observation of the Grid:\n1. The agent is at (4, 3), facing right.\n2. The blue ball is at (6, 3), which is two cells to the right of the agent's current position.\n3. There is a door at (5, 3) between the agent and the blue ball. The door's state is not explicitly given in the observation, but since the agent is not blocked by a wall or other obstacle, we can assume the door is open or can be toggled open if closed.\n4. There are no keys or other obstacles in the immediate path to the blue ball.\n\n### Steps to Achieve the Mission:\n1. The agent is already facing the correct direction (right) towards the blue ball.\n2. Move forward to (5, 3) (the door). \n   - If the door is open, the agent can move through it.\n   - If the door is closed, the agent will need to toggle it open first.\n3. After passing the door, move forward to (6, 3) where the blue ball is located.\n4. Pick up the blue ball.\n\n### Immediate Next Action:\n- The agent is at (4, 3), facing right, and the next cell (5, 3) is a door. The door's state is not explicitly given, but the most likely action is to move forward (if the door is open) or toggle (if the door is closed). Since the observation does not specify the door's state, and the agent is not carrying anything that would block movement, the safest assumption is to move forward.\n\nHowever, looking at the grid more carefully:\n- The cell at (5, 3) has object_type=4 (DOOR), color=4 (YELLOW), and state=2 (locked). This means the door is locked and requires a key to open. Since the agent is not carrying any keys, the agent cannot pass through the door yet.\n\nBut the grid observation shows that the cell at (5, 3) has state=4 (which is not a valid state for a door, as door states are 0=open, 1=closed, 2=locked). This seems like an inconsistency. Assuming it is a locked door (state=2), the agent cannot move forward and must find another path or a key. However, there are no keys visible in the grid.\n\nGiven the confusion in the door's state, and assuming the door is passable (either open or can be toggled), the next action is likely `move_forward`. If the door is locked, the agent would not be able to proceed, but the grid does not show any keys, so this might be an oversight in the grid setup.\n\nGiven the information, the most reasonable immediate action is `move_forward`.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the agent's current position to determine the optimal sequence of actions to pick up the blue ball.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Agent's Position and Orientation**:\n   - The agent is at (4, 3), facing right (→).\n   - The blue ball is at (6, 3), which is two cells to the right of the agent.\n\n2. **Path to the Blue Ball**:\n   - From (4, 3) to (6, 3), the agent needs to move right twice (to (5, 3) and then to (6, 3)).\n   - The cell at (5, 3) contains a door (object_type=4). The door's state is not explicitly given in the observation, but since the agent is not carrying any keys and the mission doesn't involve unlocking doors, we can assume the door is either open or can be toggled open.\n   - After passing the door, the agent can move to (6, 3) and pick up the blue ball (object_type=6).\n\n3. **Obstacles**:\n   - There are no walls or lava directly blocking the path to the blue ball.\n   - The door at (5, 3) is the only potential obstacle, but it can be toggled open if closed.\n\n### Action Plan:\n1. **First Action**: Move forward to (5, 3). If the door is closed, the agent will not be able to move forward and will need to toggle it open first. However, since the agent is not carrying anything and the door's state is not locked (state=2 would indicate locked), we can assume the door is either open or can be toggled open.\n   - If the door is open: `move_forward` will succeed, and the agent will move to (5, 3).\n   - If the door is closed: `move_forward` will fail, and the agent will need to `toggle` the door first. However, the observation does not indicate the door's state, so we proceed with `move_forward` first.\n\n2. **Second Action**: If the agent successfully moves to (5, 3), the next action is `move_forward` to (6, 3) to reach the blue ball.\n\n3. **Third Action**: Once at (6, 3), the agent can `pickup` the blue ball.\n\nHowever, since we can only output one action at a time, the first action should be `move_forward` to approach the blue ball.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this mission, let's analyze the grid and the agent's current position:\n\n1. **Agent Position**: The agent is at (4, 3), facing right (→).

Since the agent is facing right, the next step is to move forward to (5, 3) and interact with the door if necessary.\n\nHowever, the grid observation shows that the cell at (5, 3) has object_type=4 (door), but the state is not provided in the observation. Assuming the door is closed (state=1), the agent would need to use the 'toggle' action to open it.

The blue ball is located at (6, 3). This is directly to the right of the agent's current position (4, 3), but there is a door at (5, 3) that needs to be traversed.\n   - The door at (5, 3) has object_type=4 (DOOR), color=3 (PURPLE), and state=2 (locked). \n   - Since the door is locked, the agent cannot pass through it unless it has the matching key. However, there is no key visible in the immediate vicinity, so the agent must find another path.\n\n2. Alternative path to the blue ball:\n   - The agent can move forward to (5, 3), but the door is locked, so this is not possible.\n   - The agent can turn left (facing up) and move up to (4, 2), then turn right (facing right) and move right to (5, 2), then turn right (facing down) and move down to (5, 3), but the door is still locked.\n   - The agent can turn right (facing down) and move down to (4, 4), then turn left (facing right) and move right to (5, 4), then turn left (facing up) and move up to (5, 3), but the door is still locked.\n\nGiven that the door is locked and no key is available, the agent cannot reach the blue ball in this scenario. However, the grid seems to have walls around the agent, and the only visible path is blocked by the locked door. \n\n### Re-evaluating the Grid:\nUpon closer inspection, the agent is at (4, 3), and the blue ball is at (6, 3). The door at (5, 3) is locked (state=2), so the agent cannot pass through it without a key. There is no key in the visible grid, so the mission cannot be completed as it stands.\n\nHowever, the grid provided seems incomplete or incorrectly formatted (many cells have [-1, -1, -1], which is not a valid observation). Assuming the grid is correct and the blue ball is at (6, 3), the agent cannot reach it due to the locked door.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe agent cannot pick up the blue ball because the path is blocked by a locked door, and no key is available.

Since the observation does not explicitly state the door's state, but the agent is not blocked, we can assume it is open or can be toggled.\n   - If the door is closed, the first action should be `toggle`.\n   - If the door is open, the first action should be `move_forward`.\n2. Given the ambiguity, the safest assumption is that the door is closed (since doors are often closed by default), so we should `toggle` it first.\n3. After toggling, `move_forward` to (5, 3).\n4. Then, `move_forward` again to (6, 3).\n5.

However, since the agent is not carrying a key, it cannot open a locked door.\n   - The grid shows that the door at (5, 3) is surrounded by walls (`[5, 0, 2]` to `[5, 5, 2]`), so the door might be impassable. This suggests the agent cannot move forward to (5, 3).\n\n4. **Alternative Path**:\n   - The agent can turn left to face upwards (towards y=2) or turn right to face downwards (towards y=4).\n   - Moving upwards or downwards does not directly help reach the ball at (6, 3), as the ball is to the right.\n   - The grid shows walls (`[4, 0, 2]` to `[4, 5, 2]`) vertically, so the agent cannot move up or down from (4, 3).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The agent cannot move forward to (5, 3) due to the door (possibly locked) and walls.\n   - There is no clear path to the ball given the current observation and the agent's lack of a key.\n   - The agent cannot pick up the ball from its current position because the ball is not adjacent.\n\n### Optimal Action:\nSince the agent cannot reach the ball in the current state, the best action is to attempt to move forward to see if the door is passable (even though it might be locked).

However, (5, 3) is a door (`object_type=4`). The door's state is `2` (locked), so the agent cannot pass through it without a key.\n   - The agent does not currently have a key, so the door cannot be opened.\n   - The only other path is to go around the door. The agent can move down to (4, 4), then right to (5, 4), but (5, 4) is a wall (`object_type=2`), so this path is blocked.\n   - The agent can move up to (4, 2), then right to (5, 2), but (5, 2) is also a wall.\n   - The agent can move left to (3, 3), then up to (3, 2), right to (4, 2), up to (4, 1), right to (5, 1), down to (5, 2), but this path is too long and blocked by walls.\n   - The only viable path is to move right to (5, 3) and attempt to interact with the door, but since the door is locked and the agent has no key, this is not possible.\n\nGiven the current grid layout, the agent cannot reach the blue ball because the path is blocked by a locked door and walls.

To reach it:\n   - From (4, 3), the agent must move right to (5, 3) (door), then right again to (6, 3) (ball).\n   - Since the agent is already facing right, no turning is needed.\n   - The agent can move forward to (5, 3), then move forward again to (6, 3), and then pick up the ball.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **First action**: `move_forward` to (5, 3).\n2. **Second action**: `move_forward` to (6, 3).\n3. **Third action**: `pickup` to collect the blue ball.\n\nHowever, the agent only has 3 steps remaining, and the mission is to pick up the blue ball. The pickup action does not consume a step (based on typical game mechanics), so the agent can perform all three actions within the remaining steps.\n\n### Optimal Actions:\n- Since the agent is already facing the correct direction, the first action should be `move_forward` to (5, 3).\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the agent's current situation:\n\n1. **Agent Position and Orientation**: The agent is at (4, 3), facing right (→). This means the cell to the agent's immediate right is (5, 3).\n\n2. **Observation of (5, 3)**: The cell at (5, 3) contains [4, 2, 2], which is a DOOR (object_type=4), BLUE (color=2), and LOCKED (state=2). Since the door is locked, the agent cannot move through it without a key.\n\n3. **Mission**: The mission is to \"pick up the blue ball\". Looking at the grid, the blue ball is located at (6, 3), which is one cell to the right of the locked door at (5, 3).\n\n4. **Current Status**: The agent is not carrying anything and has 2 steps remaining. \n\n5. **Possible Actions**:\n   - The agent cannot move forward immediately because the door at (5, 3) is locked.\n   - The agent does not have a key to unlock the door (since it's not carrying anything).\n   - There are no keys visible in the immediate vicinity to pick up.\n   - The agent cannot pick up the blue ball directly because it is blocked by the locked door.\n\nGiven the current constraints (no key available and only 2 steps remaining), the agent cannot reach the blue ball in this turn. The only feasible action is to turn to face another direction, but since the mission requires picking up the blue ball and the agent cannot reach it, the best action is to do nothing (though this is not an option in the action space). However, since we must choose an action, the most logical one is to turn left or right to potentially explore other directions in future steps, but with only 2 steps remaining, this won't help. \n\nGiven the strict action space and the impossibility of completing the mission in the remaining steps, the best action is to turn right (though it doesn't help, it's the only valid action that doesn't violate rules).\n\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission:\n- **Pick up the blue ball**: The agent needs to locate and pick up a ball with color=2 (blue).\n\n### Agent's Current Position and Orientation:\n- **Position**: (4, 3)\n- **Facing**: Down (↓) (direction=1)\n- **Status**: Not carrying anything, 1 step remaining.\n\n### Observation Analysis:\n1. The agent is at (4, 3), facing down (↓). The cell directly below the agent is (4, 4), which is empty (object_type=-1, meaning it's out of bounds or invalid, but in this case, it's likely a wall or impassable since the grid height is 6 and y=4 is within bounds but marked as -1).\n2. The blue ball (object_type=6, color=2) is located at (6, 3). This is two cells to the right of the agent's current position (4, 3) → (5, 3) → (6, 3).\n   - (5, 3) is a door (object_type=4), but its state is not provided in the observation (defaults to 0 if not specified, meaning open). However, the grid shows (5, 3) as [4, 0, 0], which is a red door (color=0) with state=0 (open). So the door is open and passable.\n   - (6, 3) is the blue ball, which is reachable by moving right twice from (4, 3).\n\n### Steps to Achieve the Mission:\n1. The agent is facing down (↓). To move right, it needs to turn right (to face right →) or turn left (to face left ←). Since the ball is to the right, turning right is optimal.\n   - Action: `turn_right` (now facing right →).\n   - After turning, the agent can move forward to (5, 3), which is an open door (passable).\n   - Then move forward again to (6, 3) to reach the blue ball.\n   - Finally, `pickup` the blue ball.\n\nHowever, the agent only has **1 step remaining**, so it cannot complete the entire sequence. The best it can do is:\n- Turn right to face the direction of the ball (right →), which does not consume a step (assuming turns are free, but the rules imply all actions consume steps). If turns consume steps, the only possible action is `move_forward` (but that would move the agent into an invalid cell (4, 4), which is likely a wall or impassable).\n\nGiven the strict interpretation that all actions consume steps and the agent has only 1 step left, the optimal action is to move toward the ball. Since moving forward would not help (would go to (4, 4), which is invalid), the best action is to `turn_right` to face the ball's direction, even though it cannot reach the ball in this step.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: turn_right"],"prompt":"\n    You are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a game board and rules.\n    Your task is:\n    - First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n    - Second, output the answer in the required format.

The red box is located at (6, 3) (object_type=7, color=0 (RED)).\n2. The agent is at (2, 4), facing left.\n3. The path to the red box:\n   - From (2, 4), the agent needs to move left (west) to (1, 4), but (1, 4) is empty (-1), so it's passable.\n   - Then, the agent can move up (north) to (1, 3), which is also empty.\n   - Continue moving up to (1, 2), then (1, 1), which are empty.\n   - From (1, 1), the agent can move right (east) to (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1).\n   - From (6, 1), move down (south) to (6, 2), then (6, 3) where the red box is.\n\n### Steps to Reach the Red Box:\n1.

Pick up the red box.\n\n### Immediate Next Action:\nThe agent is at (2, 4), facing left (←), and the cell to the left (1, 4) is empty (-1), so the agent can move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this mission, we need to pick up the red box.

Turn right (to face down).\n2. Turn right (to face right).\n3. Move forward 5 times to reach (6, 4).\n4. Turn left (to face down).\n5. Move forward to reach (6, 3).\n6. Pick up the red box.\n\nSince the agent is currently facing left, the first action should be to turn right to face down, then turn right again to face right. However, the most efficient first action is to turn right to face down, then turn right to face right, but we can simplify this to just turn right twice to face right directly. \n\nBut looking at the grid, the agent is at (1,4) facing left. To move towards the box at (6,3), the agent should first face right (east), then move forward to (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), then face down (south) and move to (6,3) to pick up the box.\n\nSo the first action is to turn right to face down, then turn right to face right. But since the agent is facing left, turning right once will face it down, and turning right again will face it left again, which is not helpful. Actually, to face right from left, the agent needs to turn right twice (left -> down -> right). \n\nBut the most efficient is to turn left once to face up, then turn left again to face right. But since we can only output one action at a time, the first action should be turn_right to face down.\n\nBut looking at the grid, the agent is at (1,4) facing left. The box is at (6,3).

So the first action is turn_right.\n\nBut since we can only output one action at a time, the first action should be turn_right to face down.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Analysis:\nThe mission is to \"pick up the red box\". From the observation, we need to locate the red box (object_type=7, color=0 (RED)) in the grid.\n\n### Agent's Current Position and Orientation:\n- **Position**: (1, 4)\n- **Facing**: Up (↑) (direction=3)\n- **Status**: Not carrying anything.\n\n### Locate the Red Box:\nLooking at the grid, the red box is at coordinates (6, 3) (object_type=7, color=0).\n\n### Path to the Red Box:\nFrom the agent's current position (1, 4), we need to navigate to (6, 3). Here's the path:\n1. Move up to (1, 3).\n2. Move right to (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3).\n\nHowever, we need to check for obstacles:\n- At (1, 3): The cell is [-1, -1, -1], which seems invalid or blocked (likely a wall or obstacle). This suggests the initial move up is not possible.\n- Alternative path: Turn right to face right (→), then move forward to (2, 4), then turn left to face up, then move up to (2, 3), then right to (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3).\n\nBut (2, 4) is [-1, -1, -1], which is also blocked. This suggests the grid may have walls or obstacles not clearly represented in the observation.\n\nGiven the confusion with the grid representation, let's re-examine the observation:\n- The agent is at (1, 4), facing up. The cell above (1, 3) is [1, 3, -1], which seems invalid (likely a wall). So moving up is not possible.\n- The cell to the right (2, 4) is [2, 4, -1], also invalid (likely a wall).\n- The cell below (1, 5) is [1, 5, 2], which is a wall (object_type=2).\n\nThus, the agent is blocked in all directions except possibly turning. \n\n### Correct Approach:\nSince the agent cannot move forward initially, the first action must be to turn to face a valid direction. The agent is facing up (↑), which is blocked, so we should turn right to face right (→).\n\nAfter turning right, the agent can move forward to (2, 4) if it's not blocked. However, (2, 4) is [-1, -1, -1], which seems invalid, so this path is blocked. \n\nGiven the unclear grid representation, the safest initial action is to turn right to face right (→), then reassess.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. Turn right to face right (→).\n2. Check if (2, 4) is movable (if not, turn right again to face down).\n3.

To reach (6, 3), the agent needs to move right (→) to (3, 4), then (4, 4), then (5, 4), but (5, 4) is a wall (object_type=2), so this path is blocked.\n   - The agent must find an alternative path. The only viable path is:\n     - Move forward to (3, 4).\n     - Turn left to face up (↑).\n     - Move forward to (3, 3).\n     - Turn right to face right (→).\n     - Move forward to (4, 3).\n     - Move forward to (5, 3) (but (5, 3) is a wall, so this is invalid).\n     - Instead, after reaching (4, 3), the agent can move up to (4, 2) where there is a key (object_type=5), but the mission doesn't require a key.\n     - The correct path is to continue from (4, 3) to (6, 3) to pick up the red box.\n\nHowever, the grid shows that (6, 3) is directly accessible from (4, 3) by moving right twice (to (5, 3) is a wall, so this is invalid). The correct path is:\n- From (2, 4), move forward to (3, 4).\n- Turn left to face up (↑).\n- Move forward to (3, 3).\n- Turn right to face right (→).\n- Move forward to (4, 3).\n- Move forward to (5, 3) (wall, invalid).\n- Instead, from (4, 3), the agent must move up to (4, 2) (key), then right to (5, 2) (wall), which is not helpful.\n- The only way is to go from (3, 3) to (6, 3) by moving right, but (4, 3) to (5, 3) is blocked by a wall.\n\nWait, the grid shows that (6, 3) is the red box.

Turn left to face left (←).\n5. Move forward to (2, 3).\n6. Turn left to face down (↓).\n7.

From the observation, we need to locate the red box (object_type=7, color=0 (RED)) and navigate the agent to it to perform the pickup action.\n\n### Agent's Current Position and Orientation:\n- Agent is at (3, 2), facing right (→).\n- The agent is not carrying anything.\n\n### Locating the Red Box:\nFrom the observation, the red box is at coordinates (6, 3) (object_type=7, color=0).\n\n### Path to the Red Box:\n1. From (3, 2), the agent is facing right. The immediate cell to the right is (4, 2), which contains a key (object_type=5). Since the mission does not require picking up the key, we can ignore it for now.\n2. The next cell to the right is (5, 2), which is a wall (object_type=2). So, the agent cannot move forward beyond (4, 2).\n3. To reach (6, 3), the agent needs to:\n   - Move forward to (4, 2).\n   - Turn left to face upwards (since (6, 3) is above the current path).\n   - Move forward to (4, 3).\n   - Turn right to face right again.\n   - Move forward to (5, 3), but (5, 3) is a wall, so this path is blocked.\n   \n   Alternatively:\n   - Move forward to (4, 2).\n   - Turn right to face downwards.\n   - Move forward to (4, 3).\n   - Turn left to face right.\n   - Move forward to (5, 3), but again, (5, 3) is a wall.\n\nThis suggests that the direct path is blocked. Another approach is:\n- From (3, 2), turn left to face upwards.\n- Move forward to (3, 1), but (3, 1) is empty (object_type=-1), which seems walkable (assuming -1 is walkable).\n- Then, turn right to face right.\n- Move forward to (4, 1), which contains a ball (object_type=6). We can ignore the ball.\n- Move forward to (5, 1), which is a door (object_type=4). The door's state is not specified, but if it's open or can be toggled, we can proceed.\n- Move forward to (6, 1), which is empty.\n- Turn left to face upwards.\n- Move forward to (6, 2), which is empty.\n- Move forward to (6, 3), which is the red box.\n\nHowever, this seems too long.

Let me re-examine the grid:\n     - At (5,3): object_type=2 (WALL), so the agent cannot move forward directly to (5,3). \n     - The agent must find an alternative path to reach (6,3).\n\n### Alternative Path:\n1. From (4,3), the agent can:\n   - Turn left (now facing up) and move to (4,2).\n   - At (4,2): object_type=5 (KEY), color=2 (BLUE).

The agent cannot move directly to (5,3) because it's a wall. There is no clear path to reach (6,3) based on the given grid. \n\nGiven this, the agent cannot complete the mission with the current observation. However, the grid might have been misinterpreted. Let me re-examine the observation:\n\nLooking at the grid again:\n- (5,3) is a wall (object_type=2), so the agent cannot move forward to (5,3).\n- (4,4) is object_type=-1 (unknown, possibly empty), so the agent can move there.\n- From (4,4), the agent can move to (5,4), then to (6,4), then turn left to face (6,3) and pick up the box.\n\n### Steps:\n1.

The agent is at (4, 3), facing down. Directly below the agent at (4, 4) is empty (-1), so the agent can move forward to (4, 4).\n2. After moving to (4, 4), the agent should turn right to face left (←) (since the box is to the left of (4, 4)).\n3. Then, the agent can move forward to (5, 4), which is a wall (object_type=2), so this path is blocked.\n   - Wait, no: (5, 4) is actually a wall (object_type=2), so the agent cannot move there. This suggests the initial plan is flawed.\n4. Alternative path:\n   - From (4, 3), the agent should turn left to face right (→), then move forward to (5, 3), which is a wall (object_type=2). This is also blocked.\n   - From (4, 3), the agent could turn right to face left (←), but then moving forward would take it to (3, 3), which is empty (-1).

Correct approach:\n   - From (4, 3), the agent should move forward to (4, 4) (empty).\n   - Then, turn right to face left (←).\n   - Then, move forward to (3, 4) (empty).\n   - Then, turn left to face down (↓).\n   - Then, move forward to (3, 5), which is a wall (object_type=2). This seems incorrect.\n   - Wait, the box is at (6, 3), so moving down from (4, 3) to (4, 4) and then trying to go left is not helpful. The box is to the right of the agent's starting position.\n\n### Re-evaluating:\n- The box is at (6, 3), and the agent is at (4, 3). The agent needs to move right to reach the box.\n- Currently, the agent is facing down (↓). To move right, the agent must turn left to face right (→).\n- Then, the agent can move forward to (5, 3), which is a wall (object_type=2). This is blocked.\n- The only viable path is:\n  1. Turn left to face right (→).\n  2. Move forward to (5, 3) (blocked by wall).\n   - This suggests the agent cannot reach the box directly. There must be another way.\n- Alternatively, the agent could move down to (4, 4), then turn right to face left (←), but this moves away from the box.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe agent cannot reach the red box directly from its current position due to walls blocking the path. However, the grid shows that the agent can move down to (4, 4), then turn left to face right (→), but this seems circular. The correct first step is to turn left to face right (→), even though the immediate move is blocked, as this is the direction of the box.\n\nHowever, the immediate action is to turn left to face the box's direction.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission: Pick up the red box\n\n1. **Agent Position and Orientation**:\n   - The agent is at (4, 3), facing right (→).\n   - The agent is not carrying anything.\n\n2. **Locate the Red Box**:\n   - The red box is represented by `object_type=7` (BOX) and `color=0` (RED).\n   - From the grid, the red box is at (6, 3).\n\n3. **Path to the Red Box**:\n   - From (4, 3), the agent is facing right.

This is not relevant to the mission.\n     - The cell to the left (west) of the agent is (3, 3), which is empty (object_type=-1, meaning it's walkable).\n     - The red box is at (6, 3), which is two cells to the right (east) of the agent's current position.\n\n### Optimal Path:\n1. The agent is facing up. To move towards the red box, it needs to face right (east).\n2. The agent should:\n   - Turn right to face right (east).\n   - Move forward to (5, 3).\n   - Move forward to (6, 3).\n   - Pick up the red box.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **turn_right**: The agent is facing up; turning right will make it face right (east).\n2. **move_forward**: Move from (4, 3) to (5, 3).\n3. **move_forward**: Move from (5, 3) to (6, 3).\n4. **pickup**: Pick up the red box at (6, 3).\n\n### Next Action:\nThe first action is to turn right to face the red box.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission:\n- **Pick up the red box**: The red box is located at coordinates (6, 3) (object_type=7, color=0 (RED)).\n\n### Agent Status:\n- Position: (4, 3)\n- Facing: right (→)\n- Not carrying anything.\n\n### Path to the Red Box:\n1. The agent is at (4, 3), facing right.\n2. The red box is at (6, 3), which is two cells to the right of the agent.\n3. The path from (4, 3) to (6, 3) is clear (no walls, doors, or obstacles in between).\n\n### Steps to Complete the Mission:\n1. **Move forward** from (4, 3) to (5, 3). \n   - The cell (5, 3) is a wall (object_type=2), so we cannot move there. This suggests a misinterpretation of the grid.\n   - Rechecking the grid: The agent is at (4, 3), and the cell to its right (5, 3) is a wall (object_type=2). Thus, the agent cannot move forward directly.\n2. Alternative path:\n   - The agent needs to go around the wall. The only clear path is to move down to (4, 4), then right to (5, 4), then up to (5, 3), but (5, 4) is also a wall (object_type=2).\n   - Another option is to move up to (4, 2), then right to (5, 2), then down to (5, 3), but (5, 2) is a wall.\n   - The grid seems blocked, but the red box is at (6, 3), and the agent cannot reach it directly due to walls. This suggests the grid may have been misinterpreted.\n\n### Correct Interpretation:\n- The grid is 11x6 (width=11, height=6), with coordinates (x, y) where x ranges from 0 to 10 and y from 0 to 5.\n- The agent is at (4, 3), facing right (→).\n- The red box is at (6, 3), which is two cells to the right.\n- The cell to the right of the agent (5, 3) is a wall (object_type=2), so the agent cannot move there.\n- The cell above (4, 2) is empty (object_type=-1), so the agent can move up.\n\n### Revised Steps:\n1. Turn left to face up (↑).\n2. Move forward to (4, 2).\n3. Turn right to face right (→).\n4. Move forward to (5, 2).\n   - (5, 2) is a wall (object_type=2), so this path is blocked.\n5. Alternative:\n   - From (4, 3), turn right to face down (↓).\n   - Move forward to (4, 4).\n   - Turn left to face right (→).\n   - Move forward to (5, 4).\n     - (5, 4) is a wall (object_type=2), so this path is also blocked.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid is structured such that the agent cannot reach the red box at (6, 3) due to surrounding walls. However, the grid observation shows that (6, 3) is a floor (object_type=3) with a red box (color=0), and the agent is at (4, 3). The walls are blocking the direct path, so the agent cannot complete the mission with the given grid layout.\n\nGiven the constraints, the only possible action is to attempt to move forward, but it will fail due to the wall. However, the correct action is to turn left to face up and then move up to explore further.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: turn_left","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the agent's current position to determine the optimal sequence of actions to pick up the red box.\n\n### Observation Analysis:\n1. **Agent Position**: The agent is at (4, 3), facing up (↑).

From (4, 3), the agent is facing left. To move towards the box (which is to the right relative to the agent's current position), the agent needs to turn around or adjust its direction.\n   - First, the agent should turn right to face down (since turning left would face it up, which is not helpful here).\n   - Then, the agent can move forward to (4, 4).\n   - Next, the agent should turn right to face right.\n   - Then, the agent can move forward to (5, 4), (6, 4).\n   - Finally, the agent should turn left to face up and then move forward to (6, 3) to reach the red box.\n\nHowever, this seems inefficient. A better approach:\n- The agent is at (4, 3), facing left.

Pick up the red box.\n\n### Obstacles:\n- At (5, 3), there is a wall (`[2, 0, 2]`), but this seems to be a misinterpretation. Looking at the grid:\n   - (5, 3) is `[2, 0, 2]` (object_type=2 (WALL), color=0, state=2), which is a wall. This means the agent cannot move forward to (5, 3) directly.\n   - The agent must find an alternative path.\n\n### Alternative Path:\n- The agent cannot move directly right due to the wall at (5, 3).\n- The agent can:\n   - Move up to (4, 2) (currently facing up).\n   - Turn right to face right.\n   - Move right to (5, 2).\n   - Turn right to face down.\n   - Move down to (5, 3).\n   - Turn left to face right.\n   - Move right to (6, 3).\n   - Pick up the red box.\n\nHowever, this seems unnecessarily long. Let's re-examine the grid:\n- The agent is at (4, 3), facing up.\n- The cell in front (up) is (4, 2), which is `[5, 2, 0]` (object_type=5 (KEY), color=2 (BLUE), state=0). This is a blue key, not a wall.\n- The cell to the right is (5, 3), which is a wall (`[2, 0, 2]`).\n- The cell to the left is (3, 3), which is `[-1, -1, -1]` (invalid or out of bounds?).\n- The cell below is (4, 4), which is `[-1, -1, -1]` (invalid or out of bounds?).\n\nGiven this, the agent cannot move right due to the wall, and moving left or down seems invalid. The only valid move is to move up to (4, 2), where the blue key is. However, the mission is to pick up the red box, not the key. \n\n### Correct Approach:\nThe red box is at (6, 3). The agent must reach this position to pick it up. Given the wall at (5, 3), the agent cannot move directly right. The only way is:\n1. Move up to (4, 2).\n2. Turn right to face right.\n3. Move right to (5, 2).\n4. Turn right to face down.\n5. Move down to (5, 3) (but this is a wall, so this path is invalid).\n   \nThis seems impossible. Wait, perhaps the grid is not correctly interpreted. Let me re-examine the grid coordinates:\n- The grid is 11x6, so columns are 0-10 (width=11), rows are 0-5 (height=6).\n- The agent is at (4, 3), facing up.\n- The cell in front (up) is (4, 2), which is `[5, 2, 0]` (blue key).\n- The cell to the right is (5, 3), which is `[2, 0, 2]` (wall).\n- The cell to the left is (3, 3), which is `[-1, -1, -1]` (invalid).\n- The cell below is (4, 4), which is `[-1, -1, -1]` (invalid).\n\nThus, the only valid move is to move up to (4, 2), pick up the blue key, then turn right to face right, move right to (5, 2), turn right to face down, move down to (5, 3) (but this is a wall), which is invalid. \n\nThis suggests the mission is impossible due to the wall blocking the path to the red box. However, perhaps the wall at (5, 3) is not a wall but something else. The object_type=2 is WALL, so it is indeed a wall.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe red box is at (6, 3), but the agent cannot reach it because the path is blocked by a wall at (5, 3). Therefore, the mission cannot be completed.\n\nHowever, looking again, the agent can:\n1. Move up to (4, 2) (blue key).\n2. Turn right to face right.\n3. Move right to (5, 2).\n4. Turn right to face down.\n5. Move down to (5, 3) (wall, cannot move).\nThis is invalid. \n\nAlternatively:\n1. Turn left to face left.\n2. Cannot move left (invalid cell at (3, 3)).\nThis is also invalid.\n\nThus, the mission is impossible with the given grid.

The path from the agent to the red box:\n   - From (4, 3), the agent is facing up (towards (4, 2)).\n   - The cell in front of the agent (4, 2) contains a key (object_type=5), but we don't need it for this mission.\n   - To reach (6, 3), the agent needs to:\n     - Move forward to (4, 2) (but this is not directly helpful).\n     - Instead, the agent should turn right to face right (→), then move forward to (5, 3), then turn right again to face down (↓), then move forward to (6, 3).\n\n### Steps to Reach the Red Box:\n1. **Turn right**: Agent now faces right (→).\n2. **Move forward**: Agent moves to (5, 3).\n   - (5, 3) is a wall (object_type=2), so this is not possible. This suggests a mistake in the initial plan.\n3. Re-evaluate:\n   - From (4, 3), facing up, the agent cannot move forward to (4, 2) because (4, 2) has a key, which is passable (object_type=5 is not a wall).\n   - After moving to (4, 2), the agent can turn left to face left (←), then move forward to (3, 2), then turn left to face down (↓), then move forward to (6, 3).\n   - Alternatively, a simpler path:\n     - From (4, 3), turn left to face left (←), move forward to (3, 3), then turn right to face down (↓), then move forward to (6, 3).\n\n### Correct Path:\n1. **Turn left**: Agent now faces left (←).\n2. **Move forward**: Agent moves to (3, 3).\n3. **Turn right**: Agent now faces down (↓).\n4. **Move forward**: Agent moves to (6, 3) (red box location).\n5. **Pick up**: Pick up the red box.\n\n### Next Action:\nThe first action is to **turn left** to start this path.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the agent's current position to determine the optimal sequence of actions to pick up the red box.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Agent's Position and Orientation**:\n   - The agent is at (4, 3), facing left (←).\n   - The red box is at (6, 3), which is two cells to the right of the agent's current position.\n\n2. **Path to the Red Box**:\n   - From (4, 3), the agent needs to move right twice to reach (6, 3).\n   - Currently, the agent is facing left, so it must turn around to face right first.\n\n3. **Obstacles**:\n   - The cell directly to the left of the agent (3, 3) is empty (object_type: -1), but the agent doesn't need to go left.\n   - The cell to the right of the agent (5, 3) is a wall (object_type: 2), but the red box is at (6, 3), which is beyond this wall. This suggests the observation might have incomplete or incorrect data, but based on the given grid, the red box is at (6, 3), and the agent can move right to reach it after turning.\n\n4. **Actions Required**:\n   - Turn right to face down (since the agent is facing left, turning right will face it down, but this seems incorrect. Actually, turning right from left will face the agent up, and another right will face it right. Alternatively, turning left once will face the agent down, and turning left again will face it right. This needs clarification.)\n   - Alternatively, turning right twice will change the direction from left to right (left → down → right).\n   - Then, move forward twice to reach (6, 3).\n   - Finally, pick up the red box.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Turn right (now facing down).\n2. Turn right (now facing right).\n3. Move forward (to (5, 3)).\n4. Move forward (to (6, 3)).\n5. Pick up the red box.\n\nHowever, the cell (5, 3) is a wall, so the agent cannot move there. This suggests the observation might have an error, or the red box is not reachable as described. Assuming the red box is at (6, 3) and the path is clear (ignoring the wall at (5, 3) as a possible error), the correct sequence would be:\n\n1. Turn right (now facing down).\n2. Turn right (now facing right).\n3. Move forward (to (5, 3)).\n4. Move forward (to (6, 3)).\n5. Pick up the red box.\n\nBut since (5, 3) is a wall, the agent cannot move there. Alternatively, if the agent can move to (6, 3) directly, the steps would be:\n\n1. Turn right (now facing down).\n2. Turn right (now facing right).\n3. Move forward (to (6, 3)).\n4. Pick up the red box.\n\nGiven the confusion, the most plausible action is to turn right to start facing the correct direction, then move forward if possible.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe agent should turn right to face the direction towards the red box, then move forward to reach it, and finally pick it up. The first action is to turn right.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission:\n- **Pick up the red box**: The red box is located at coordinates (6, 3) (object_type=7, color=0 (RED)).\n\n### Agent:\n- **Position**: (4, 3)\n- **Facing**: Up (↑)\n- **Not carrying anything**: We need to pick up the red box, so no need to drop anything.\n\n### Path to the Red Box:\n1. The agent is at (4, 3), facing up. The cell directly in front (up) is (4, 2), which contains a key (object_type=5). Since the mission is to pick up the red box, we can ignore the key for now.\n2. To reach the red box at (6, 3), the agent needs to move right twice (from (4, 3) to (5, 3) to (6, 3)).\n   - Currently, the agent is facing up, so it needs to turn right to face right (→) first.\n   - After turning right, the agent can move forward twice to reach (6, 3).\n   - At (6, 3), the agent can pick up the red box.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Turn right**: Changes the agent's direction from up (↑) to right (→).\n2. **Move forward**: Moves the agent from (4, 3) to (5, 3).\n3. **Move forward**: Moves the agent from (5, 3) to (6, 3).\n4. **Pickup**: Picks up the red box at (6, 3).\n\n### Obstacles:\n- The path from (4, 3) to (6, 3) is clear (no walls or lava).\n- The key at (4, 2) is irrelevant to the mission, so we can ignore it.\n\n### Optimal Action Sequence:\nThe shortest path is:\n1. Turn right (to face right).\n2. Move forward (to (5, 3)).\n3. Move forward (to (6, 3)).\n4.

This means the agent cannot move directly to (6, 3) from (4, 3) by moving right twice because the path is blocked by a wall at (5, 3).\n\n4. **Alternative Path**:\n   - The agent can move up to (4, 2), where there is a key `[5, 0, 0]` (object_type=5 for KEY, color=0 for RED, state=0). However, the mission does not require picking up a key, so this is unnecessary.\n   - The agent can move down to (4, 4), but the cell is `[-1, -1, -1]`, which is invalid or out of bounds.\n   - The agent can turn left to face up or down, but this does not help in reaching the red box directly.\n\n5. **Re-evaluating the Observation**:\n   - The red box is at (6, 3), but the path is blocked by a wall at (5, 3). There is no clear path to reach the red box based on the given grid. The agent cannot move through walls, and there are no doors or other paths to bypass the wall.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the current grid observation, the red box is unreachable because the path is blocked by a wall. The agent cannot perform any action to pick up the red box under these constraints. \n\nHowever, since the mission is to pick up the red box and the box exists at (6, 3), the only logical action is to attempt to move towards it, even though the path is blocked. The agent is currently facing right, and the next cell to the right is (5, 3), which is a wall. The agent cannot move forward into a wall, so no valid action can be taken to progress towards the mission. \n\nGiven the strict action list and the impossibility of completing the mission, the only possible action is to attempt to move forward, even though it will fail due to the wall. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Analysis:\nThe mission is to \"pick up the red box\".

To reach (6, 3), the agent needs to move right (east).\n   - The agent must first turn right to face down (since it's currently facing left, turning right will make it face down), then turn right again to face right (east).\n   - Then, the agent can move forward twice to reach (6, 3).\n   - Once at (6, 3), the agent can pick up the red box.\n\n### Steps:\n1. `turn_right` (now facing down).\n2. `turn_right` (now facing right).\n3. `move_forward` (to (5, 3)).\n4. `move_forward` (to (6, 3)).\n5. `pickup` (to pick up the red box).\n\nHowever, looking at the grid more carefully:\n- At (5, 3), there is a wall (object_type=2), so the agent cannot move forward to (5, 3).

The direct path is blocked by a wall at (5, 3).\n- The agent can go up to (4, 2), then right to (6, 2), then down to (6, 3):\n   - `turn_left` (now facing up).\n   - `move_forward` (to (4, 2)).\n   - `turn_right` (now facing right).\n   - `move_forward` (to (5, 2)).\n   - `move_forward` (to (6, 2)).\n   - `turn_right` (now facing down).\n   - `move_forward` (to (6, 3)).\n   - `pickup`.\n\nThis path is clear and avoids obstacles.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: turn_left","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission:\n- **Pick up the red box**: The red box is represented by object_type=7 (BOX) and color=0 (RED).

The agent is facing down (↓). To move left, it needs to turn left (to face right) or turn right (to face left). Wait, no: the agent's direction is encoded as 1=down, so:\n   - Current direction: down (1).\n   - To face left (2), the agent needs to turn left once.\n   - Then, move_forward to (3, 4).\n   - Then, turn left again to face up (3).\n   - Then, move_forward to (3, 3).\n   - Then, turn right to face right (0).\n   - Then, move_forward to (6, 3).\n   - Finally, pickup the red box.\n\nHowever, looking at the grid:\n- The agent is at (4, 4), facing down (↓).

The agent is currently facing up (towards (4, 3)), but (4, 3) is empty (-1), so the agent can move forward to (4, 3).\n3. After moving to (4, 3), the agent needs to turn right to face right (towards (5, 3)) or turn left to face left (towards (3, 3)). Since the red box is to the right (x=6), the agent should turn right to face right.\n4. From (4, 3), facing right, the agent can move forward to (5, 3). However, (5, 3) is a wall (object_type=2), so the agent cannot move there. Instead, the agent should move to (5, 3) is not possible, so the agent needs to find another path.\n5. Alternative path: From (4, 3), the agent can move forward to (4, 2) (if facing up), but (4, 2) is a key (object_type=5), which is not relevant to the mission. Instead, the agent should turn right to face right (towards (5, 3)), but (5, 3) is a wall, so this is not helpful.\n6. Another approach: From (4, 4), the agent can turn right to face right (towards (5, 4)), then move forward to (5, 4). (5, 4) is a wall (object_type=2), so this is not possible.\n7. Another approach: From (4, 4), the agent can turn left to face left (towards (3, 4)), then move forward to (3, 4). (3, 4) is empty (-1), so the agent can move there.\n8. From (3, 4), the agent can turn left again to face down (towards (3, 5)), but (3, 5) is a wall (object_type=2), so this is not helpful.\n9. From (3, 4), the agent can turn right to face up (towards (3, 3)), then move forward to (3, 3). (3, 3) is empty (-1), so the agent can move there.\n10.

Instead, from (4, 3), the agent can turn left to face left (towards (3, 3)), then move forward to (3, 3), but this is also backtracking.\n13. The most efficient path seems to be:\n    - From (4, 4), turn left to face left (towards (3, 4)).\n    - Move forward to (3, 4).\n    - Turn right to face up (towards (3, 3)).\n    - Move forward to (3, 3).\n    - Turn right to face right (towards (4, 3)).\n    - Move forward to (4, 3).\n    - Turn right to face down (towards (4, 4)).\n    - Move forward to (4, 4).\n    - This seems to be going in circles, so this approach is not working.\n\n### Correct Approach:\nThe red box is at (6, 3). The agent is at (4, 4), facing up. The agent needs to move towards (6, 3):\n1. From (4, 4), the agent should turn right to face right (towards (5, 4)).\n2. However, (5, 4) is a wall, so the agent cannot move there.\n3. Instead, the agent should turn left to face left (towards (3, 4)).\n4. Move forward to (3, 4).\n5. Turn left to face down (towards (3, 5)), but (3, 5) is a wall.\n6. Turn right to face left (towards (3, 4)) again.\n7. This is not progressing towards the red box.\n\n### Optimal Path:\nThe agent needs to reach (6, 3) from (4, 4). The path is:\n1. From (4, 4), move forward to (4, 3) (facing up).\n2. From (4, 3), turn right to face right (towards (5, 3)), but (5, 3) is a wall.\n3. Instead, from (4, 3), turn left to face up (towards (4, 2)).\n4. Move forward to (4, 2).\n5. From (4, 2), turn left to face left (towards (3, 2)).\n6. Move forward to (3, 2).\n7. From (3, 2), turn left to face down (towards (3, 3)).\n8. Move forward to (3, 3).\n9. From (3, 3), turn right to face left (towards (2, 3)).\n10. Move forward to (2, 3).\n11. From (2, 3), turn right to face down (towards (2, 4)).\n12. Move forward to (2, 4).\n13. From (2, 4), turn right to face right (towards (3, 4)).\n14. Move forward to (3, 4).\n15. From (3, 4), turn right to face down (towards (3, 5)), but (3, 5) is a wall.\n16. This path is too long and not efficient.\n\n### Simplified Path:\nThe agent can:\n1. From (4, 4), turn left to face left (towards (3, 4)).\n2. Move forward to (3, 4).\n3. From (3, 4), turn left to face down (towards (3, 5)), but (3, 5) is a wall.\n4. Instead, from (3, 4), turn right to face left (towards (3, 4)) again.\n5. This is not helpful.\n\n### Final Decision:\nThe most straightforward action from the current position is to move forward to (4, 3), which is empty and allows the agent to progress towards the red box.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission: Pick up the red box\n1. **Agent Position and Orientation**: The agent is at (4, 3), facing up (↑).

However, the mission is to pick up a red box, so we can ignore this for now.\n   - At (6, 3): The cell contains [7, ?, ?], which is a BOX (object_type=7). We need to verify if this is the red box.\n     - The color for the box is not explicitly given in the observation, but since this is the only box visible in the grid, it is likely the target.\n3. **Path to the Box**:\n   - From (4, 3), the agent needs to move to (6, 3) to reach the box.\n   - Current facing: up (↑).

Not relevant to the mission.\n   - (4, 4): object_type=-1 (invalid or empty). This seems like a valid move.\n- After moving down to (4, 4), the agent can then turn right (to face right) and move right to (5, 4), which is a wall (object_type=2). Not useful.\n- Alternatively, from (4, 4), the agent can turn left (to face down) and move down to (4, 5), which is a wall (object_type=2). Not useful.\n- Another option is to move up from (4, 3) to (4, 2), pick up the key (though not needed for the mission), then turn left (to face up) and move up to (4, 1), which is a ball (object_type=6). Not useful.\n- The most straightforward path is to turn left (to face up), move up to (4, 2), then turn right (to face right), move right to (5, 2), which is a wall.

Not useful.\n\n### Re-evaluating:\nThe grid seems to have limited mobility. The red box is at (6, 3), and the agent is at (4, 3). The direct path is blocked by a wall at (5, 3). The only way to reach (6, 3) is:\n1. Move down to (4, 4).\n2. Turn right to face left.\n3. Move left to (3, 4).\n4. Turn left to face down.\n5. Move down to (3, 5), which is a wall. Not useful.\n6. Alternatively, from (3, 4), move left to (2, 4), which is empty, then down to (2, 5), which is a wall. Not useful.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe grid seems to have no valid path to the red box due to walls blocking all possible routes. However, the agent might be able to interact with the box directly if it is adjacent, but the box is at (6, 3) and the agent is at (4, 3), which is not adjacent.\n\nGiven the constraints, the agent cannot reach the red box in this grid configuration. However, the initial move should be to attempt to move down to (4, 4) to explore further.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission:\n- **Pick up the red box**: We need to locate the red box (object_type=7, color=0 (RED)) and pick it up.\n\n### Agent's Current Position and Orientation:\n- **Position**: (4, 3)\n- **Facing**: Right (→)\n- **Status**: Not carrying anything\n\n### Grid Analysis:\n1.

However, this path seems convoluted and may not be the shortest.\n   - Alternatively, the agent can turn left (to face up), move forward to (4, 2), turn right (to face right), move forward to (5, 2), turn right (to face down), move forward to (5, 3), turn left (to face right), and then move forward to (6, 3).

The agent needs to face right to move towards the box. Since the agent is facing left (direction=2), turning right will make it face up (direction=3). This is not optimal. \n   - To face right (direction=0), the agent needs to turn left once (from left (2) to up (3) to right (0) would take two left turns, but this is not efficient).\n   - Alternatively, turning right from left (2) goes to up (3), then right again to right (0).

Path to the box:\n   - From (4,3), we can move right to (5,3) - but this is a wall (object_type=2)\n   - We need to go around:\n     - Move up to (4,2) - contains a key (object_type=5), but we don't need it\n     - Move left to (3,3) - empty\n     - Then down to (6,3) where the box is\n\nHowever, looking at the grid more carefully:\n- The agent is at (4,3) facing right\n- The cell to our right (5,3) is a wall, so we can't move forward\n- The cell above us (4,2) has a key (not needed)\n- The cell below us (4,4) is empty (-1 means no data, but likely walkable)\n\nBest immediate action is to turn left to face upwards, then we can move towards the box via (4,2) -> (3,2) -> etc.\n\nFirst action should be turn_left to change our facing direction.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission:\n- **Pick up the red box**\n\n### Agent Status:\n- **Position**: (4, 3)\n- **Facing**: Up (↑)\n- **Carrying**: Nothing\n- **Steps remaining**: 7\n\n### Grid Analysis:\n1. The agent is at (4, 3), facing up. The cell directly above the agent is (4, 2), which contains:\n   - Object type: 5 (KEY)\n   - Color: Not relevant for the mission (since we're looking for a red box)\n   - State: 0\n\n2. The red box is located at (6, 3):\n   - Object type: 7 (BOX)\n   - Color: 0 (RED)\n   - State: 0\n\n### Path to the Red Box:\n- From (4, 3), the agent needs to move to (6, 3) to pick up the red box.\n- The agent is currently facing up. To move towards the red box, the agent needs to face right (towards increasing x-coordinate).\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Turn right**: The agent is facing up; turning right will make the agent face right (towards (5, 3)).\n2. **Move forward**: Move from (4, 3) to (5, 3).\n   - (5, 3) contains object type 2 (WALL), so the agent cannot move here. This suggests a misinterpretation of the grid.\n   - Re-evaluating the grid: The agent is at (4, 3), and the cell to the right (5, 3) is a WALL (object type 2). Thus, the agent cannot move right directly.\n3. Alternative path:\n   - The agent must first move down to (4, 4), then right to (5, 4), then up to (5, 3), but (5, 3) is a WALL. This path is blocked.\n   - Another alternative: The agent can move left to (3, 3), then down to (3, 4), then right to (6, 4), then up to (6, 3). However, this is too long and exceeds the step limit.\n   - The most efficient path is to turn left to face left, move left to (3, 3), then turn right to face down, move down to (3, 4), then turn right to face right, move right to (6, 4), then turn left to face up, and move up to (6, 3). But this is 7 steps, which matches the remaining steps.\n\nHowever, the grid shows that (6, 3) is directly accessible from (4, 3) by moving right twice (to (6, 3)), but (5, 3) is a WALL, so this is not possible. The only viable path is the longer one described above, but it requires 7 steps, which is the limit. \n\nGiven the time constraints, the first step is to turn left to face left, then move left to (3, 3).\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: turn_left","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission: \n\"pick up the red box\"\n\n### Agent Status:\n- Position: (4, 3)\n- Facing: left (←)\n- Carrying: nothing\n- Steps remaining: 6\n\n### Grid Analysis:\n1. The agent is at (4, 3), facing left (←). The cell to the left of the agent is (4, 2), which contains:\n   - object_type: 5 (KEY)\n   - color: 2 (BLUE)\n   - state: 0\n   This is a blue key, not relevant to the mission.\n\n2. The red box is located at (6, 3):\n   - object_type: 7 (BOX)\n   - color: 0 (RED)\n   - state: 0\n   This is the target we need to pick up.\n\n### Path to the Red Box:\nFrom the agent's current position (4, 3) to the red box at (6, 3):\n1. The agent is facing left (←). To move towards the red box, it needs to face right (→) because the box is to the right of the agent.\n2. After turning right, the agent can move forward to (5, 3), then to (6, 3), and pick up the red box.\n\n### Steps:\n1. `turn_right`: The agent is currently facing left (←). Turning right will make it face down (↓). Wait, no: \n   - The agent's direction is represented as 2 (left). Turning right (clockwise) will change the direction to 1 (down). This is not what we want. We want the agent to face right (0).\n   - To face right from left, the agent needs to turn right twice (left → down → right) or turn left twice (left → up → right). Since turning right once will face down, turning right again will face right. So two `turn_right` actions are needed.\n   - However, we only have 6 steps, so we need to optimize. Alternatively, we can turn left once to face up, then turn left again to face right. But this is also two steps.\n   - The most efficient is two `turn_right` actions to face right.\n\n2. `move_forward`: Move from (4, 3) to (5, 3).\n3. `move_forward`: Move from (5, 3) to (6, 3).\n4. `pickup`: Pick up the red box at (6, 3).\n\nTotal steps used: 4 (2 turns, 2 moves, 1 pickup). But we have 6 steps, so this is feasible.\n\n### Verification:\n- After two `turn_right` actions, the agent will face right (0).\n- Then two `move_forward` actions will take the agent to (6, 3).\n- Then `pickup` will pick up the red box.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe optimal sequence is:\n1. `turn_right`\n2. `turn_right`\n3. `move_forward`\n4. `move_forward`\n5. `pickup`\n\nBut since we can only output one action at a time, the first action is `turn_right`.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission:\n- **Pick up the red box**: The red box is located at (6, 3) (object_type=7, color=0 (RED)).\n\n### Agent Status:\n- Position: (4, 3)\n- Facing: Up (↑)\n- Not carrying anything.\n- Steps remaining: 5.\n\n### Path to the Red Box:\n1. The agent is at (4, 3), facing up. The red box is at (6, 3), which is to the right of the agent's current position.\n2. To reach (6, 3), the agent needs to:\n   - Turn right to face right (→).\n   - Move forward twice to reach (6, 3).\n   - Pick up the red box.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Turn right**: Changes the agent's direction from up (↑) to right (→).\n2. **Move forward**: Moves from (4, 3) to (5, 3). The cell (5, 3) is a wall (object_type=2), so this move is blocked. This means the initial plan won't work.\n   \n   **Alternative Path**:\n   - The agent must first move up to (4, 2), then turn right to face right, then move forward to (5, 2), then turn right to face down, then move forward to (6, 2), then turn left to face right, then move forward to (6, 3), and finally pick up the box. However, this requires more than 5 steps, which is not feasible.\n\n   **Another Observation**:\n   - The cell (4, 2) contains a key (object_type=5), but the mission is to pick up the red box, not the key. The key is not relevant here.\n   - The cell (5, 1) is a door (object_type=4), but it's not in the path to the red box.\n\n   **Conclusion**: The red box is unreachable within 5 steps because the direct path is blocked by a wall, and the alternative path requires more steps than allowed.\n\n### Final Answer:\nSince the red box cannot be reached within the remaining steps, the best action is to do nothing (but since \"done\" is only for goal reached, and no other action is possible, we'll choose \"move_forward\" even though it's blocked, as it's the only logical attempt).\n\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission: \nPick up the red box.\n\n### Agent's Current Position and Orientation:\n- Position: (4, 3)\n- Facing: Up (↑)\n- Not carrying anything.\n- Steps remaining: 4\n\n### Observation Analysis:\n1. The red box is located at (6, 3) (object_type=7, color=0 (RED)).\n2. The agent is at (4, 3), facing up. To reach the red box at (6, 3), the agent needs to move right twice (from (4,3) to (5,3) to (6,3)).\n3. Currently, the agent is facing up, so it needs to turn right to face right (towards the red box).\n\n### Steps to Achieve the Mission:\n1. Turn right to face right (current direction: up → turn right → direction: right).\n2. Move forward to (5, 3).\n3. Move forward to (6, 3).\n4. Pick up the red box.\n\nHowever, the agent only has 4 steps remaining, and the above plan requires 4 actions (turn_right, move_forward, move_forward, pickup). This fits within the step limit.\n\n### Potential Issues:\n- The cell at (5, 3) has object_type=2 (WALL), which means the agent cannot move through it. This is a problem because the path to (6, 3) is blocked by a wall at (5, 3).\n- The grid seems to have some inconsistencies or missing data (many cells have [-1, -1, -1], which are not defined in the rules). This makes it difficult to fully analyze the environment.\n\nGiven the current observation, the agent cannot reach the red box in 4 steps because the path is blocked by a wall. However, if we assume the wall at (5, 3) is a typo and should be passable (e.g., FLOOR), then the plan would work. But based on the given data, the wall is impassable.\n\n### Alternative Approach:\nSince the direct path is blocked, the agent cannot complete the mission in the given steps. The only possible action is to turn right to face the direction of the box, even though it cannot reach it.\n\n### Final Answer:\nGiven the constraints and the grid observation, the best action is to turn right to face the box, even though it cannot be reached.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Analysis:\nThe mission is to \"pick up the red box\". From the observation, we need to locate the red box (object_type=7, color=0 (RED)) and pick it up.\n\n### Agent's Current Position and Orientation:\n- **Position**: (4, 3)\n- **Facing**: right (→)\n- **Status**: Not carrying anything, 3 steps remaining.\n\n### Locating the Red Box:\nFrom the observation, the red box is at coordinates (6, 3) (object_type=7, color=0). \n\n### Path to the Red Box:\n1. The agent is at (4, 3), facing right.\n2. The cell directly in front of the agent (to the right) is (5, 3), which is a WALL (object_type=2). The agent cannot move forward into a wall.\n3. To reach the red box at (6, 3), the agent must first move left to (3, 3), then down to (3, 4), then right to (6, 4), and then up to (6, 3). However, this path is too long and exceeds the 3 steps remaining.\n4. Alternatively, the agent can turn left to face down, move forward to (4, 4), then turn right to face right, and move forward to (5, 4). But (5, 4) is a WALL, so this path is invalid.\n5. Another option is to turn right to face down, move forward to (4, 4), then turn left to face right, and move forward to (5, 4). Again, (5, 4) is a WALL, so this path is invalid.\n\nGiven the constraints (only 3 steps remaining and walls blocking direct paths), it is impossible to reach the red box in the remaining steps. \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe agent cannot complete the mission with the given steps and obstacles. The only possible action is to turn left or right, but neither will help in reaching the box within the remaining steps.\n\nSince no valid action can achieve the mission, the best action is to do nothing (but since \"done\" is only for goal reached, we choose a neutral action like \"turn_left\").\n\nAnswer: turn_left","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission:\n- **Pick up the red box**\n\n### Agent Status:\n- **Position**: (4, 3)\n- **Facing**: Up (↑)\n- **Carrying**: Nothing\n- **Steps remaining**: 2\n\n### Observation:\nThe grid is 11x6, and the agent is at (4, 3). The red box is at (6, 3) (object_type=7, color=0 (RED)). \n\n### Path to the Red Box:\n1. The agent is at (4, 3), facing up. The red box is at (6, 3), which is to the right of the agent's current position.\n2. To reach (6, 3), the agent needs to:\n   - Turn right to face right (since it's currently facing up).\n   - Move forward twice to reach (6, 3).\n   - Pick up the red box.\n\nHowever, the agent only has 2 steps remaining, so we must optimize the actions to achieve the mission within these steps.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Turn right**: This will change the agent's direction from up (↑) to right (→). Now the agent is facing right.\n   - Steps remaining: 1\n2. **Move forward**: The agent moves from (4, 3) to (5, 3). \n   - Steps remaining: 0\n   - Now the agent is at (5, 3), facing right, and the red box is at (6, 3), which is directly to the right. However, the agent cannot move further because it has no steps left.\n\nThis approach does not allow the agent to reach the red box within 2 steps. \n\n### Alternative Approach:\nSince the agent cannot reach the red box in 2 steps, the best action is to turn right to face the red box, so that if more steps were available, the agent could move forward and pick it up.\n\n### Final Action:\nGiven the constraints, the optimal action is to turn right to face the red box.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission:\n- **Pick up the red box**: The agent needs to locate and pick up a box with the color red (color code 0).\n\n### Agent's Current Position and Orientation:\n- **Position**: (4, 3)\n- **Facing**: Right (→)\n- **Status**: Not carrying anything, 1 step remaining.\n\n### Observation of the Grid:\nThe grid is 11x6, and the agent is at (4, 3). Let's look at the relevant cells around the agent:\n1. **Agent's current cell (4, 3)**: Object type 10 (AGENT), facing right.\n2. **Cell to the right of the agent (5, 3)**: Object type 2 (WALL). The agent cannot move forward because there's a wall.\n3. **Cell above the agent (4, 2)**: Object type 5 (KEY), color 2 (BLUE). Not relevant to the mission.\n4. **Cell below the agent (4, 4)**: Object type -1 (invalid or empty). Not relevant.\n5. **Cell to the left of the agent (3, 3)**: Object type -1 (invalid or empty). Not relevant.\n6. **Other cells**:\n   - (6, 3): Object type 7 (BOX), color 0 (RED). This is the red box we need to pick up.\n\n### Path to the Red Box:\nThe red box is at (6, 3). From the agent's current position (4, 3), the path is:\n1. Move right to (5, 3): Blocked by a wall.\n2. Move left to (3, 3): Empty, but doesn't help reach the box.\n3. Move up to (4, 2): Contains a key, not useful.\n4. Move down to (4, 4): Empty, not useful.\n\nSince the agent cannot move forward (right) due to the wall, the only way to reach the red box is to:\n1. Turn left (now facing up).\n2. Move forward to (4, 2) (blue key, not useful).\n3. Turn left again (now facing left).\n4. Move forward to (3, 2) (empty).\n5. Turn left again (now facing down).\n6. Move forward to (3, 3) (empty).\n7. Turn right (now facing left).\n8. Move forward to (2, 3) (empty).\n9. Turn right (now facing down).\n10. Move forward to (2, 4) (empty).\n11. Turn right (now facing right).\n12. Move forward to (3, 4) (empty).\n13. Move forward to (4, 4) (empty).\n14. Move forward to (5, 4) (wall).\n15. Turn left (now facing up).\n16. Move forward to (5, 3) (wall).\n17. Turn left (now facing left).\n18. Move forward to (4, 3) (back to start).\nThis path is too long and not optimal, especially with only 1 step remaining.\n\n### Optimal Action:\nGiven that the agent has only 1 step remaining, it cannot reach the red box in this step. The only possible action is to turn left or right to change direction for future steps, but since the mission cannot be completed in the remaining step, the best action is to turn left to start reorienting for future steps.\n\nAnswer: turn_left"],"prompt":"\n    You are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a game board and rules.\n    Your task is:\n    - First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n    - Second, output the answer in the required format.

The agent is at (4, 6), facing up.\n   - To reach the key, the agent needs to move left (west) to (1, 6), then move up (north) to (1, 1).\n   - Currently, the agent is facing up, so it can move forward to (4, 5), but this is not directly helpful. Instead, the agent should turn left to face left (←) and then move forward to (3, 6).\n   - However, the grid shows walls (object_type=2) to the left of the agent at (4, 6), so the agent cannot move left directly. Instead, the agent should turn right to face right (→), then move forward to (5, 6), then turn right again to face down (↓), then move forward to (5, 7), but this is a wall. This path seems blocked.\n   - Alternatively, the agent can turn left to face left (←), but cannot move left due to the wall. The only viable immediate move is to turn right to face right (→), then move forward to (5, 6), then turn left to face up (↑), then move forward to (5, 5), but this is also a wall. This suggests the agent is in a confined space.\n   - Wait, the grid shows that (4, 6) is surrounded by walls to the left (3,6) and right (5,6), and the agent is facing up, so (4,5) is empty (object_type=-1, which seems to be a floor). The agent can move forward to (4,5).\n   - From (4,5), the agent can turn left to face left (←), then move forward to (3,5), then turn left to face down (↓), then move forward to (3,6), then turn right to face left (←), then move forward to (2,6), and so on until reaching (1,6), then turn right to face up (↑), then move forward to (1,1) to pick up the key.\n   - This is a long path, but it seems necessary given the walls.\n\n2. **Open the door**:\n   - After picking up the key, the door is at (5,1). The agent needs to navigate to (5,1), face it, and use the \"toggle\" action to open it.\n\n3. **Reach the goal**:\n   - After the door is open, the goal is at (6,6). The agent needs to navigate to (6,6) and use the \"done\" action.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nGiven the current position and surroundings, the agent can move forward to (4,5) as the first step towards the key.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this mission, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Locate the key**: The key is at position (1, 1) with object_type=5 (KEY) and color=1 (GREEN).\n2. **Pick up the key**: The agent is currently at (4, 5) facing up (↑). To reach the key, the agent needs to move left and then up.\n3. **Open the door**: The door is at position (5, 1) with object_type=4 (DOOR) and color=1 (GREEN). The agent needs to use the key to open the door.\n4. **Reach the goal**: The goal is at position (6, 6) with object_type=8 (GOAL). After opening the door, the agent can proceed to the goal.\n\n### Step-by-Step Actions:\n1. **Turn left**: The agent is facing up (↑). Turning left will make it face left (←).\n2. **Move forward**: Move left to (3, 5).\n3. **Move forward**: Move left to (2, 5).\n4. **Move forward**: Move left to (1, 5).\n5. **Turn right**: Turn right to face up (↑).\n6. **Move forward**: Move up to (1, 4).\n7. **Move forward**: Move up to (1, 3).\n8. **Move forward**: Move up to (1, 2).\n9. **Move forward**: Move up to (1, 1).\n10. **Pickup**: Pick up the key at (1, 1).\n11. **Turn right**: Turn right to face right (→).\n12. **Move forward**: Move right to (2, 1).\n13. **Move forward**: Move right to (3, 1).\n14. **Move forward**: Move right to (4, 1).\n15. **Move forward**: Move right to (5, 1).\n16. **Toggle**: Use the key to open the door at (5, 1).\n17. **Move forward**: Move right to (6, 1).\n18. **Turn left**: Turn left to face up (↑).\n19. **Move forward**: Move up to (6, 2).\n20. **Move forward**: Move up to (6, 3).\n21. **Move forward**: Move up to (6, 4).\n22. **Move forward**: Move up to (6, 5).\n23. **Move forward**: Move up to (6, 6).\n24. **Done**: Reach the goal at (6, 6).\n\n### Current Step:\nThe agent is at (4, 5) facing up (↑). The first action is to turn left to face left (←).\n\nAnswer: turn_left","To solve this mission, we need to follow these steps:\n1. Pick up the key located at (1, 1).\n2. Use the key to open the locked door at (5, 1).\n3. Move to the goal at (6, 6).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Current Position and Orientation**: The agent is at (4, 5), facing left (←). The key is at (1, 1), which is to the upper left of the agent.\n2. **Path to the Key**:\n   - First, the agent needs to turn right to face upwards (since it's currently facing left, turning right will make it face down, but this seems incorrect. Actually, turning left would make it face down, and turning right would make it face up. Wait, no: current direction is left (2), turning right would make it face up (3), turning left would make it face down (1)).\n   - To reach (1, 1) from (4, 5), the agent should face up, move forward to (4, 4), then turn left to face right, move forward to (5, 4), then turn left to face up, move forward to (5, 1), then turn right to face left, and move forward to (1, 1). However, this seems convoluted. Alternatively, from (4, 5), the agent can turn right to face up, move forward to (4, 4), then turn left to face left, move forward to (3, 4), then turn left to face down, move forward to (3, 1), then turn right to face left, and move forward to (1, 1). This path avoids walls and is more direct.\n3. **Pick Up the Key**: Once at (1, 1), the agent can pick up the key.\n4. **Path to the Door**: From (1, 1), the agent needs to go to the door at (5, 1). The agent can turn right to face down, move forward to (1, 5), then turn right to face right, and move forward to (5, 5), then turn left to face up, and move forward to (5, 1).\n5. **Open the Door**: At (5, 1), the agent can toggle the door to open it (since it has the key).\n6. **Path to the Goal**: From (5, 1), the agent can move forward to (5, 6) (since the door is now open), then turn right to face right, and move forward to (6, 6) to reach the goal.\n\n### Immediate Next Action:\nThe agent is at (4, 5), facing left. To start moving towards the key at (1, 1), the agent should turn right to face up (since facing left is direction 2, turning right changes direction to 3 (up)).\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Let me analyze the grid and plan the optimal path to complete the mission:\n\n1.

So the first action should be turn_left to face up, then turn_left to face left, then move_forward to reach (1,5).\n\nBut looking at the coordinates, (2,5) to (1,5) is moving left (decreasing x), so the agent needs to face left.

This will require turning right (to face right), moving forward to (2, 2), turning left (to face up), moving forward to (2, 1), turning right (to face right), and then moving forward to (5, 1).\n3. **Unlock the Door**: Use the `toggle` action to unlock the door.\n4. **Navigate to the Goal**: After unlocking the door, move to the goal at (6, 6). This will require moving right to (6, 1), turning left (to face down), moving down to (6, 6), and then using the `done` action.\n\n### Immediate Next Action:\nThe first step is to pick up the key at (1, 1), which is directly in front of the agent. The agent is already facing the key, so we can use the `pickup` action.\n\nAnswer: pickup","To solve this mission, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Locate the Key**: The key is needed to open the locked door.

Alternatively, perhaps the grid is misrepresented, and the key is at (1,1), which is (-1,-1,-1), which is also invalid.\n\n   This seems like a bug in the grid representation. For the sake of proceeding, let's assume the key is at (5,1) (the green door), and we need to pick it up (even though it's a door).\n\n3. **Path to the Key**:\n   - From (4,2), facing right, the key is at (5,1), which is one step to the right (to (5,2)) and then one step up (to (5,1)).\n   - However, (5,2) is a wall (object_type=2), so we cannot move there. This suggests the grid is invalid or the key is not reachable.\n\n   This seems unsolvable with the given grid. Perhaps the grid is misaligned or incomplete. \n\nGiven the grid seems invalid or unsolvable as presented, the only logical action is to move forward to (5,2), but that's a wall, so the agent cannot move there. Alternatively, perhaps the agent should turn left or right to explore, but without a clear path, this is impossible.\n\nGiven the grid is likely incorrect, the best guess is to turn left to face upwards and try to move towards where the key might be (but it's not visible).\n\nAnswer: turn_left","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Breakdown:\n1. **Use the key to open the door**: This implies we need to find a key, pick it up, then find a locked door, and use the key to open it.\n2. **Get to the goal**: After opening the door, navigate to the goal.\n\n### Grid Analysis:\n- **Agent Position**: (4, 2), facing up (↑).\n- **Key**: The key is located at (5, 1) (object_type=4, which is a DOOR, but the grid seems to have some inconsistencies.

The key is not visible in the immediate vicinity, so we need to explore the grid to find it. However, the grid observation provided does not show any key (object_type=5) in the visible cells. This suggests the key might be in one of the cells marked with `-1` (which are not fully described in the observation). \n\n2. **Open the Door**: Once the key is found, the agent needs to use it to open the locked door. The door is located at (5, 1) (object_type=4, color=1, state=2, which means it's a locked door). The agent must first pick up the key, then move to the door, and use the `toggle` action to open it.\n\n3. **Reach the Goal**: After opening the door, the agent can proceed to the goal located at (6, 6) (object_type=8).\n\nGiven the current observation, the agent is facing up (↑) at (4, 2). The cell directly in front of the agent (4, 1) is marked as `-1`, which might contain the key or other objects.

Since the agent is facing up and there's a wall in front (at (4, 0)), we should turn right to face right (→) and then move forward to explore the area to the right where the key might be.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1. Turn right to face right (→).\n2. Move forward to (5, 1) (the door is here, but we don't have the key yet).\n3. Continue exploring to find the key.\n\nHowever, since the grid is not fully visible, we can assume the key is somewhere reachable.

However, the grid seems to be partially observable (some cells are marked with -1). The agent must explore to find the key. Given the grid, the key might be in one of the unexplored cells (marked -1).\n3. **Optimal Path**: Since the door is directly to the right, and the agent is not carrying a key, the immediate action should be to explore for the key. However, the grid does not show the key in any visible cell, so we might need to move forward to reveal more of the grid.\n\nGiven the current observation, the best immediate action is to move forward to (5, 1) to interact with the door or reveal more of the grid. However, since the door is closed and the agent has no key, moving forward might not be possible. Alternatively, the agent could turn to explore other directions, but the grid does not show any other paths.\n\nGiven the limited information, the most logical action is to attempt to move forward to the door, even though it might not succeed. Alternatively, if the door is locked (state=2), the agent cannot pass without a key.

Assuming the door is at (5,1) and the key is also there, the agent can pick up the key and then toggle the door to open it.\n\n3. **Reach the Goal**: After opening the door, the agent can proceed to the goal at (6,6). However, the path seems blocked by walls, so this might require further moves.\n\nGiven the time constraints (10 steps remaining), the immediate action is to pick up the key at (5,1). The agent is currently at (4,2), facing up. To reach (5,1), the agent should:\n- Turn left to face left (←).\n- Move forward to (3,2).\n- Turn left to face down (↓).\n- Move forward to (3,1).\n- Turn right to face right (→).\n- Move forward to (4,1).\n- Move forward to (5,1).\n- Pick up the key.\n\nHowever, since we can only output one action at a time, the first action is to turn left to face left.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","Let me analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1.

Observation Analysis:\n- There's a door at (5,1) (object_type=4)\n- The goal is at (6,6) (object_type=8)\n- I don't see any keys in the immediate vicinity (object_type=5)\n- The agent is currently facing left, towards (3,2)\n\n4. Path Planning:\n- First need to find a key (but none visible in observation)\n- The door at (5,1) is likely locked (state=2) since we need to use a key\n- Since no key is visible, I need to explore to find one\n- The only accessible path is to the left (west) from current position\n\n5. Next Action:\n- Currently facing left (west) where there's empty space at (3,2)\n- Should move forward to explore for keys\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Let's analyze the game board and mission step by step.\n\n1. **Agent Position and Orientation**: The agent is at (3, 2), facing left (←). This means the cell to its immediate left is (3, 1).\n\n2. **Observation of (3, 1)**: The cell at (3, 1) is `[3, 1, -1]`. The first value (3) indicates it's a FLOOR, and the second value (1) is GREEN. The third value (-1) is not a standard state, but since it's a FLOOR, it's likely passable.\n\n3. **Mission Requirements**: \n   - \"use the key to open the door\": We need to find a key and a door. \n   - \"get to the goal\": The goal is at (6, 6), which is `[6, 6, 8]` (object_type=8).\n\n4. **Key and Door Locations**:\n   - There is a door at (5, 1) `[5, 1, 4]` (object_type=4, color=1=GREEN, state=?). \n   - There is a key somewhere on the board. From the grid, the key is not immediately visible in the provided observation, but it's likely nearby since the mission requires using it.\n\n5. **Path to the Goal**:\n   - The agent needs to move left to (3, 1), then likely proceed upwards or downwards to find the key.\n   - After obtaining the key, it needs to go to the door at (5, 1), use the key to open it, and then proceed to the goal at (6, 6).\n\n6. **Immediate Action**:\n   - The agent is facing left, and the cell to its left (3, 1) is a passable FLOOR. The first step is to move forward to (3, 1).\n\nThus, the immediate action is to move forward. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this mission, we need to follow these steps:\n1. Locate the key (object_type=5) and pick it up.\n2. Use the key to open the locked door (object_type=4, state=2).\n3. Navigate to the goal (object_type=8).\n\nFrom the observation:\n- The agent is at (2, 2), facing left (←).\n- The key is at (5, 1) (object_type=5).\n- The door is at (5, 1) (object_type=4, state=2).\n- The goal is at (6, 6) (object_type=8).\n\n### Steps:\n1. The agent is currently facing left (←). To move towards the key, the agent needs to turn right to face down (↓), then move forward to (3, 2), then turn left to face right (→), then move forward to (5, 2), then turn left to face up (↑), and then move forward to (5, 1) to pick up the key.\n2. After picking up the key, the agent can toggle the door at (5, 1) to open it.\n3. Then, the agent can move down to (5, 2), turn right to face right (→), move forward to (6, 2), then turn right to face down (↓), and move forward to (6, 6) to reach the goal.\n\nHowever, given the limited steps (7 remaining), we need to optimize the path. Here's the optimal sequence:\n1. Turn right to face down (↓).\n2. Move forward to (3, 2).\n3. Turn left to face right (→).\n4. Move forward to (5, 2).\n5. Turn left to face up (↑).\n6. Move forward to (5, 1) and pick up the key.\n7. Toggle the door at (5, 1) to open it.\n8. Move down to (5, 2).\n9. Turn right to face right (→).\n10. Move forward to (6, 2).\n11. Turn right to face down (↓).\n12. Move forward to (6, 6) to reach the goal.\n\nBut since we only have 7 steps remaining, we need to prioritize the immediate next action. The first action should be to turn right to face down (↓).\n\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this mission, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Locate the key**: The key is needed to open the locked door. From the observation, the key is at position (5, 1) (object_type=4, which is a DOOR, but the mission mentions using a key, so we might need to look for a KEY object. However, in the given grid, there is no KEY object (object_type=5) present. This suggests that the door at (5, 1) might already be unlocked or the key is not visible in the grid. \n\n2. **Open the door**: The door at (5, 1) is currently closed (state=2, which is locked). Since we don't have a key in the grid, this might be a problem. However, the mission states \"use the key to open the door,\" implying the key should be present. Given the grid, it seems the key might be missing or the door is already unlocked. \n\n3. **Reach the goal**: The goal is at (6, 6) (object_type=8).\n\nGiven the agent is at (2, 2) facing up (↑), and the door is at (5, 1), the agent needs to move towards the door first. However, since the agent is facing up, it cannot move forward immediately as (2, 1) is a wall (object_type=2). \n\n### Steps:\n1. Turn right to face right (→).\n2. Move forward to (3, 2).\n3. Move forward to (4, 2).\n4. Move forward to (5, 2).\n5. Turn left to face up (↑).\n6. Move forward to (5, 1) (the door).\n7. Toggle the door to open it.\n8. Move forward to (5, 0), but this is a wall, so this path is invalid.\n   \nGiven the time constraints (6 steps remaining), the agent cannot reach the goal in time. However, the immediate next step is to turn right to face right (→) to start moving towards the door.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Breakdown:\n1. **Use the key to open the door**: This implies we need to find a key, pick it up, then find a door, and use the key to open it.\n2. **Get to the goal**: After opening the door, we need to reach the goal.\n\n### Observation Analysis:\n- **Agent Position**: (2, 2), facing right (→).\n- **Agent Status**: Not carrying anything, 5 steps remaining.\n- **Grid Layout**:\n  - The agent is in the middle-left of the grid, surrounded by walls (object_type=2) or empty spaces (object_type=-1).\n  - There is a door at (5, 1) (object_type=4, color=1 (GREEN), state=2 (locked)).\n  - There is a goal at (6, 6) (object_type=8).\n  - There is no visible key in the immediate vicinity. However, the grid shows some cells as -1, which might indicate hidden or unobserved areas. Given the mission mentions a key, we must assume it exists in the grid, likely nearby.\n\n### Path Planning:\n1. **Find the Key**: Since the door is locked (state=2), we need a key matching the door's color (GREEN). The key is not visible in the observed grid, so we must explore.\n   - The agent is at (2, 2), facing right. The cell to the right (3, 2) is empty (-1), so we can move forward to explore.\n2. **Open the Door**: After picking up the key, we need to go to the door at (5, 1) and use the key to open it.\n3. **Reach the Goal**: After opening the door, we can proceed to the goal at (6, 6).\n\n### Immediate Action:\n- The agent is facing right, and the cell to the right (3, 2) is empty (-1). Moving forward is safe and allows exploration for the key.\n\n### Answer:\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this mission, let's analyze the grid and the agent's current situation:\n\n1. **Agent Position**: (3, 2), facing right (→)\n2. **Mission**: Use the key to open the door and then get to the goal.\n3. **Observation**:\n   - The agent is not carrying anything.\n   - There is a door at (5, 1) (object_type=4, color=1 (GREEN), state=2 (LOCKED)).\n   - There is a key at (5, 1) (object_type=5, color=1 (GREEN), state=0).\n   - The goal is at (6, 6) (object_type=8, color=0 (RED), state=0).\n\n**Steps to Complete the Mission**:\n1. **Pick Up the Key**: The agent needs to move to (5, 1) to pick up the green key.\n   - From (3, 2), facing right, the agent should move forward to (4, 2), then (5, 2).\n   - Then turn left (to face up) and move forward to (5, 1).\n   - Use the `pickup` action to collect the green key.\n2. **Open the Door**: The agent needs to unlock and open the door at (5, 1).\n   - The door is already at (5, 1), so the agent can use the `toggle` action to unlock and open it (since it has the matching green key).\n3. **Reach the Goal**: After the door is open, the agent can move to the goal at (6, 6).\n   - From (5, 1), the agent can move down to (5, 2), then right to (6, 2), and continue moving right to (6, 6).\n\nHowever, the agent only has **4 steps remaining**, so we need to prioritize the most critical actions:\n- The immediate next step is to move toward the key. The agent is at (3, 2), facing right. The next cell to the right is (4, 2), which is empty (object_type=1), so the agent can move forward.\n\n**Next Action**: `move_forward` to (4, 2).\n\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Breakdown:\n1. **Use the key to open the door**: This implies we need to find a key, pick it up, then find a locked door, and use the key to open it.\n2. **Get to the goal**: After opening the door, we need to reach the goal.\n\n### Observation Analysis:\n- **Agent Position**: (4, 2), facing right (→).\n- **Agent Status**: Not carrying anything, 3 steps remaining.\n- **Grid Layout**:\n  - The agent is at (4, 2), facing right. To the right of the agent (at (5, 2)) is a wall (object_type=2), so the agent cannot move forward yet.\n  - There is a door at (5, 1) (object_type=4, color=1 (green), state=1 (closed)). This is likely the door we need to open.\n  - There is a key somewhere on the grid. From the observation, the key is not directly visible in the immediate vicinity of the agent. However, the grid shows that at (5, 1) there is a door, and at (6, 6) there is the goal (object_type=8).\n  - The key is likely placed somewhere accessible, but the grid provided does not explicitly show its location. Assuming the key is placed at (4, 1) (since (4, 1) is marked as -1, which might be a placeholder for the key).\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n1. **Turn Left**: The agent is facing right, and the door is at (5, 1), which is above and to the right. To move towards the door, the agent needs to face upwards (up). Turning left will change the agent's direction from right to up.\n2. **Move Forward**: After turning left, the agent will face up. Moving forward will take the agent to (4, 1), where the key is likely located.\n3. **Pickup Key**: At (4, 1), the agent can pick up the key.\n4. **Turn Right**: After picking up the key, the agent needs to face right again to approach the door at (5, 1).\n5. **Move Forward**: Move towards the door at (5, 1).\n6. **Toggle Door**: Use the key to open the door.\n7. **Move Forward**: After the door is open, move through it towards the goal at (6, 6).\n\nHowever, the agent only has 3 steps remaining, so we need to prioritize the most critical actions within these steps. Given the limited steps, the immediate priority is to pick up the key and open the door.\n\n### Immediate Actions (3 steps):\n1. **Turn Left**: Change direction to up to move towards the key.\n2. **Move Forward**: Move to (4, 1) to pick up the key.\n3. **Pickup**: Pick up the key at (4, 1).\n\nSince we only have 3 steps, we cannot complete the entire mission, but we can get the key, which is the first part of the mission.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe first action is to turn left to face the key.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Breakdown:\n1. **Use the key to open the door**: \n   - First, we need to find and pick up a key.\n   - Then, locate the door that matches the key's color and open it using the key.\n2. **Get to the goal**: \n   - After the door is open, navigate to the goal.\n\n### Observation Analysis:\n- **Agent Position**: (4, 2), facing up (↑).\n- **Agent Status**: Not carrying anything, 2 steps remaining.\n- **Key**: There is a key at position (5, 1) (object_type=4, color=1 (GREEN), state=2 (locked door? Wait, no: object_type=4 is DOOR, and object_type=5 is KEY. Wait, the grid seems to have object_type=5 at (5,1), but the description says object_type=5 is KEY. So (5,1) is a KEY (color=1, GREEN).\n- **Door**: There is a door at (5,1)? Wait, no: (5,1) is a KEY. The grid seems to have no doors (object_type=4) except possibly at the edges where object_type=2 (WALL) is present. But the grid is unclear. Maybe the door is at (5,1), but (5,1) is a KEY. Alternatively, the door might be elsewhere, but it's not visible in the grid.\n- **Goal**: The goal is at (6,6) (object_type=8).\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Pick up the key**: \n   - The key is at (5,1). From the agent's position (4,2), facing up, the key is to the right and up. \n   - To reach (5,1), the agent needs to:\n     - Turn right to face right (→).\n     - Move forward to (5,2).\n     - Turn left to face up (↑).\n     - Move forward to (5,1).\n     - Pick up the key.\n   - However, the agent only has 2 steps remaining, so this is impossible in one move. The agent cannot reach the key in 2 steps. \n\n### Re-evaluation:\n- The grid seems incomplete or unclear. The only key is at (5,1), but the agent cannot reach it in 2 steps. \n- Alternatively, maybe the agent can move to (4,1) in one step (move_forward from (4,2) facing up), but (4,1) is object_type=-1, which is invalid. \n- The grid edges are walls (object_type=2), so the agent cannot move outside.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the current observation and steps remaining, the agent cannot complete the mission.

This means the cell to the left of the agent is (0, 11).\n\n2. **Grid Analysis**: \n   - The grid is 19x19, and the agent is near the left edge (x=1).\n   - The observation shows that the first column (x=0) is mostly walls (object_type=2), except for some cells where the color and state are not -1. However, the agent's immediate left (0, 11) is not explicitly described, but given the pattern, it's likely a wall or obstacle.\n   - The agent is not carrying anything, and there are no immediate objects (like keys or doors) mentioned in the vicinity.\n\n3. **Mission**: The mission is to \"reach the goal.\" Since the goal's position is not explicitly given in the observation, we must assume it's somewhere reachable. Given the agent's position and the grid's structure, the agent likely needs to navigate around walls or obstacles.\n\n4. **Possible Actions**:\n   - `move_forward`: If the cell to the left (0, 11) is not a wall, the agent can move forward. However, given the grid's structure, this is unlikely.\n   - `turn_left` or `turn_right`: If the path forward is blocked, the agent should turn to explore other directions.\n   - Since the agent is at the edge and facing a wall, moving forward is not possible.

To reach it:\n     - Turn right (to face right).\n     - Move forward to (3, 2).\n     - Turn right again (to face down).\n     - Move forward to (3, 3) (goal).\n\n### Optimal Action Sequence:\nGiven the current state (agent at (1, 2), facing down, not carrying anything), the first action is to move forward to (1, 3) to pick up the key.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: move_forward","Let's analyze the grid and mission step by step:\n\n1.

It needs to turn to face a direction where it can move toward the key.\n\n5. **Optimal Path**:\n   - The key is at (0, 1). To reach it, the agent should:\n     - Turn right to face up (since turning left would face it down, which is not helpful).\n     - Move forward to (1, 1).\n     - Turn left to face left.\n     - Move forward to (0, 1) to pick up the key.\n   - After picking up the key, the agent can proceed to the door at (2, 2) and then to the goal.\n\n6. **Immediate Action**:\n   - The agent is facing left (wall), so the first action is to turn right to face up.\n\n### Answer: turn_right","To solve this mission, let's analyze the grid and the agent's current state:\n\n1. **Current Position**: Agent is at (1, 2), facing up (↑)\n2. **Mission Requirements**:\n   - Use a key to open a door\n   - Then reach the goal (which is at (3, 3))\n\n**Observation Analysis**:\n- The agent is facing up (towards (1, 1)), but there's nothing directly in front (cell (1,1) is empty (-1)).\n- There's a door at (2, 2) to the agent's right (east).\n- There's a goal at (3, 3) to the northeast.\n- No keys are visible in the immediate observation.\n\n**Plan**:\n1.

This suggests the key might be in a cell marked as `-1` (unknown or not provided). Since the grid doesn't show a key, we might need to assume it's in one of the `-1` cells, but this is unclear.\n\n2. **Open the Door**: There is a door at (2, 2) (object_type=4, color=2 (blue), state=2 (locked)). To open it, we need a matching key (blue key).

The door at (2, 2) is locked (state=2), so we need a key to open it. However, there is no key visible in the grid. This suggests the key might be hidden or not present, but since the mission mentions \"use the key,\" we must assume the key is somewhere accessible or already in the inventory (but the status says \"not carrying anything\").\n2. The goal is at (3, 3), but the door at (2, 2) blocks the path to it.\n\n### Possible Issues:\n- If there is no key in the grid, the mission cannot be completed as stated. However, since the mission explicitly mentions \"use the key,\" it's likely that the key is present but not visible in the given observation (perhaps in an adjacent cell not shown or requires interaction).\n- Alternatively, the door might be unlockable without a key (but the state=2 suggests it's locked and requires a key).\n\n### Assumptions:\nGiven the grid and mission, the most plausible interpretation is that the key is nearby or the door can be toggled open despite being locked (but this contradicts the rules). Since the grid doesn't show a key, we might need to explore further.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nThe agent is facing up (↑). To move toward the door at (2, 2), the agent should:\n1. Turn right to face right (→).\n2. Move forward to (2, 2).\n3. Attempt to toggle the door (though it's locked, this might reveal the key or open it if the state is incorrect).\n\nHowever, since the door is locked and no key is present, the only logical action is to explore further.

We should move forward to pick it up.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this mission, let's analyze the grid and the agent's current state:\n\n1. **Agent Position**: (1,1), facing up (direction=3)\n2. **Mission**: Use the key to open the door and get to the goal.\n3. **Observation**:\n   - There is a door at (2,2) (object_type=4, state=2 (locked), color=2 (blue)).\n   - There is a goal at (3,3) (object_type=8, color=3 (purple)).\n   - There is a key at (0,1) (object_type=5, color=2 (blue)) - matches the door's color.\n   - The agent is not carrying anything.\n\n**Steps to solve**:\n1. **Pick up the key**: The agent needs to turn left (to face left\/direction=2), move forward to (0,1), and pick up the blue key.\n2. **Open the door**: Return to (1,1), turn right (to face down\/direction=1), move to (1,2), turn right (to face right\/direction=0), move to (2,2), and toggle the door (since the agent has the matching key).\n3. **Reach the goal**: Move through the now-open door to (2,2), then move to (3,2), turn right (to face down\/direction=1), move to (3,3), and declare \"done\".\n\nHowever, with only 7 steps remaining, we need to optimize:\n- Current step 1: turn_left (now facing left).\n- Step 2: move_forward to (0,1).\n- Step 3: pickup the blue key.\n- Step 4: move_forward to (1,1).\n- Step 5: turn_right (now facing down).\n- Step 6: move_forward to (1,2).\n- Step 7: turn_right (now facing right).\n- Step 8: move_forward to (2,2) and toggle the door (but we're out of steps).\n\nThis won't work in 7 steps. Alternative approach:\n1. turn_left (facing left).\n2. move_forward to (0,1).\n3. pickup the key.\n4. move_forward to (1,1).\n5. turn_right (facing up).\n6. turn_right (facing right).\n7. move_forward to (2,1).\nStill not enough to reach the door.\n\nGiven the step limit, the best immediate action is to turn left to start heading toward the key.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","Let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n1. **Agent Position and Orientation**: The agent is at (1, 1), facing left (←). This means the cell to its left is (0, 1), and the cell to its right is (2, 1).\n\n2. **Observation**:\n   - At (0, 1): [1, 1, 2] - This is a FLOOR (object_type=1) with color GREEN (color=1). The state is 2, but since it's not a door, this is likely irrelevant. There's no key or door here.\n   - At (1, 0): [1, 0, 2] - FLOOR with color RED. No key or door.\n   - At (1, 2): [1, 2, -1] - FLOOR with color BLUE. No key or door.\n   - At (2, 2): [2, 2, 4] - This is a DOOR (object_type=4) with color BLUE (color=2). The state is 4, but door states are 0=open, 1=closed, 2=locked. This seems like an inconsistency, but assuming it's locked (state=2) since we need to use a key.\n   - At (3, 3): [3, 3, 8] - This is the GOAL (object_type=8) with color PURPLE (color=3).\n\n3. **Mission**: \"use the key to open the door and then get to the goal\". \n   - First, we need to find a key. Looking around, there is no key visible in the immediate vicinity. The agent is not carrying anything.\n   - The door at (2, 2) is locked (assuming state=2), so we need a key of the same color (BLUE) to open it.\n   - The goal is at (3, 3), but the door at (2, 2) is in the way.\n\n4. **Possible Keys**: Since no keys are visible in the grid, this seems like a problem. However, the grid might be incomplete or the key is hidden. Alternatively, the agent might already have the key, but the status says \"not carrying anything\".\n\nGiven the current observation and the mission, it seems impossible to complete the mission because there is no key available to open the door. However, since the grid might be incomplete or there might be an error, the best immediate action is to move towards the door to investigate further.\n\nThe agent is facing left (←), but there's nothing useful to the left (just a green floor). The door is to the right (east) of the agent's current position. So the agent should turn right to face the door, then move forward to approach it.\n\nHere's the sequence:\n1. `turn_right` to face right (→).\n2. `move_forward` to move to (2, 1).\n3. Then, the agent would be next to the door at (2, 2), but without a key, it can't open it.\n\nSince we can only provide one action at a time, the first action is `turn_right`.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Let's analyze the grid and mission step by step.\n\n1.

Find and pick up a key.\n2. Use the key to open a locked door.\n3. Reach the goal.\n\n### Grid Analysis:\n- **Agent Position**: (1, 1), facing up (↑).\n- **Agent Status**: Not carrying anything, 1 step remaining (this seems like a turn limit, but we'll proceed as if steps are not a limiting factor for planning).\n- **Key (object_type=5)**: Not visible in the provided grid. This suggests the key might be missing or not present in the observable grid.\n- **Door (object_type=4)**: Located at (2, 2). The state is not explicitly given, but doors can be open (0), closed (1), or locked (2). Since the mission mentions \"open the door,\" we can assume it's locked or closed.\n- **Goal (object_type=8)**: Located at (3, 3).\n\n### Observations:\n1. There is no key visible in the grid, so the agent cannot pick up a key to open the door. This suggests the door might already be open or the key is hidden elsewhere (but not in the provided grid).\n2. The door at (2, 2) is the only obstacle between the agent and the goal. If the door is open or can be toggled open, the agent can proceed to the goal.\n3. The agent is facing up (↑), so moving forward would take it to (1, 0), which is a wall (object_type=2). Thus, the agent cannot move forward initially.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Turn to face the door (right or left, depending on the shortest path).\n   - Currently facing up, so turning right would face the agent right (→), and turning left would face it left (←).\n   - The door is to the right of the agent (from (1,1) to (2,2)), so turning right is optimal.\n2. Move forward to approach the door.\n3. Toggle the door to open it (if closed or locked).\n4. Proceed to the goal.\n\nHowever, since the grid does not show a key, and the agent cannot pick up a key, the only way to proceed is to assume the door can be toggled open (if it's closed but not locked). \n\n### Immediate Action:\nThe agent is facing up and cannot move forward (would hit a wall).

However, the grid does not show any keys (object_type=5) in the observation. This suggests the keys might be hidden or not present, but since the mission requires opening the doors, we must assume the keys are accessible or the doors can be toggled without keys.\n   \n   Given the grid, the red door is at (3, 2).

However, there is no red key visible in the grid.

This suggests the mission might be unsolvable in the current state, or we might be missing something.\n\n2. **Open the Blue Door**:\n   - The blue door is also locked (state=2), so we need a blue key to unlock it.\n   - There is no blue key visible in the grid (no object_type=5 with color=2).\n\n### Re-evaluation:\nGiven that both doors are locked and there are no keys in the grid, the mission cannot be completed as stated. However, let's check if the doors can be toggled without keys (perhaps the state is incorrect in the observation):\n- The red door is at (3, 2), and the agent is at (4, 3), facing right. To face the red door, the agent needs to:\n   - Turn left (to face up), then move forward to (4, 2), then turn left again (to face left), then move forward to (3, 2). Then, we can try to toggle the door.\n- The blue door is at (8, 4), and the agent would need to navigate there similarly.\n\nBut since both doors are locked and no keys are present, the mission is impossible in the current state. \n\n### Possible Action:\nGiven the rules, the only logical action is to move toward the red door to attempt to interact with it, even though it might not work due to the lack of a key.

Wait, the agent is facing right (→), so to face left, the agent should turn left twice (to face left) or turn right twice (to face left). The most straightforward is to turn left to face up, but that doesn't help. Actually, to face left from right, the agent should turn left once (to face up), then turn left again (to face left). Alternatively, turn right once (to face down), then turn right again (to face left). The shortest is to turn left twice.\n\nBut looking at the grid, the agent is at (6, 2), and the red door is at (3, 2), so the agent needs to move left (west).

The door's state is 4 (DOOR), color is 0 (RED), and state is 2 (locked). Since it's locked, we need a red key to open it. However, there is no red key visible in the immediate vicinity, so we might need to search for it.\n\n3. **Blue Door Location**: The blue door is at (8, 4), which is further to the right and down from the agent.

This suggests the red door cannot be opened at this time, which contradicts the mission's feasibility. But since the mission is given, we must assume the key is somehow accessible or the door can be toggled without a key (though the rules state locked doors need matching keys).\n   - Given the grid, it seems the red door is the only interactable object nearby, so we proceed to toggle it (even though it might not work due to lack of key).\n\n3. **Approach the Blue Door**:\n   - The blue door is at (8, 4), which is far to the right and down from the agent's position.\n   - After dealing with the red door, the agent would need to move right and down to reach the blue door.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nSince the agent is at (2, 2) facing up and the red door is at (3, 2), the first step is to turn right to face right (east), then move forward to (3, 2).\n\n### Action Sequence:\n1.

However, the state values in the observation seem inconsistent (the red door shows state=4, which is not a valid state for doors). Assuming it is locked (state=2), we would need a red key to open it.

The only possible action is to move forward to the red door, but this will not achieve anything. However, since the mission requires opening the red door first, and the agent cannot do so without a key, the best action is to move toward the red door.\n\n### Action:\nThe agent is facing left (←), and the cell to the left is the red door at (3, 2). The agent can move forward to the red door, even though it cannot open it yet.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this mission, we need to open the red door first, then the blue door. Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Current Position & Orientation**: The agent is at (4, 2), facing left (←). The red door is at (3, 2), which is directly to the left of the agent. The blue door is at (8, 4), which is further to the right and down from the agent's starting position.\n\n2. **Approach the Red Door**:\n   - The agent is already facing the red door (left direction) and can move forward to reach it.\n   - The red door is at (3, 2), and the agent is at (4, 2). Moving left (←) will take the agent to (3, 2), where the red door is located.\n   - Since the red door is a door (object_type=4), we need to use the `toggle` action to open it.\n\n3. **Approach the Blue Door**:\n   - After opening the red door, the agent needs to navigate to the blue door at (8, 4).\n   - From (3, 2), the agent should turn right (to face down ↓), move forward to (3, 3), then turn right again (to face right →), and move forward to (8, 3).

We may need to explore further to find it.\n- The blue key (color=2) is not visible in the provided grid snippet. We may need to explore further to find it.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nSince the agent is at (4, 2) facing left, the cell to the left is (3, 2), which is the red door. However, the door is locked, and we don't have the red key yet. Thus, we cannot open it now.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. Turn around to explore the area for keys:\n   - The agent is facing left. To explore other directions, we can `turn_right` to face down or `turn_left` to face up.\n   - Turning right would face the agent down (toward increasing y-values), which might reveal more of the grid.\n\n### Optimal Action:\nGiven the limited visibility and the need to find keys, the best immediate action is to `turn_right` to face downward and explore further.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this mission, we need to open the red door and then the blue door.

Alternatively, the door might be toggleable despite being locked.\n   - Since the red door is directly in front of the agent (facing up), we can try to `toggle` it first. If it doesn't work, we might need to find a red key, but none are visible.\n\n2. **Open the Blue Door**:\n   - The blue door is also locked (state=2), so we need a blue key.

The blue door is located at (8, 4) (object_type=4, color=2 (BLUE), state=2 (locked)).\n\n### Agent Status:\n- Position: (2, 2), facing left (←).\n- Not carrying anything.\n- 1 step remaining (this seems like a typo or incomplete information, but we'll proceed as if it's not limiting us).\n\n### Steps to Complete the Mission:\n1. Open the red door:\n   - The red door is locked (state=2), so we need a red key (color=0) to unlock it.\n   - However, the grid does not show any keys (object_type=5) in the visible area. This suggests the red key might be elsewhere or not provided, but since the mission is to open the red door, we'll assume it's possible.\n   - The red door is directly to the right of the agent (since the agent is at (2, 2) facing left, the cell to the left is (1, 2), and the cell to the right is (3, 2)). The agent is facing left, so the red door is behind the agent.\n\n2. Open the blue door:\n   - The blue door is also locked (state=2), so we need a blue key (color=2) to unlock it.\n   - No blue keys are visible in the grid either.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nSince the agent is facing left and the red door is to its right, the first step is to turn around to face the red door. The agent should:\n1. Turn right (to face down).\n2. Turn right again (to face right, now pointing at the red door at (3, 2)).\n3. Attempt to toggle the red door (though it's locked, this might be the only action possible given the constraints).\n\nHowever, since the agent has only 1 step remaining (as per the status), the only possible action is to turn right to start reorienting toward the red door.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: turn_right"],"prompt":"\n    You are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a game board and rules.\n    Your task is:\n    - First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n    - Second, output the answer in the required format.

The yellow room is likely a region with yellow-colored cells (color=4). We need to find a path to the blue key in this room.\n\n2. **Unlock the blue door**:\n   - After picking up the blue key, we need to find a blue door (object_type=4, color=2, state=2 (locked)) and use the key to unlock it (toggle action).\n\n3. **Go to the goal**:\n   - Finally, navigate to the goal (object_type=8) after unlocking the blue door.\n\n### Observations:\n- The agent is at (8, 17), facing down (↓). The cell directly below (8, 18) is a wall (object_type=2), so the agent cannot move forward.\n- The grid is sparsely populated with walls (object_type=2) at the edges and some interior walls. Most cells are empty (object_type=1) or floors (object_type=3).\n- The blue key and yellow room are not visible in the provided grid snippet, but we can infer that the agent needs to explore to find them.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nSince the agent cannot move forward (blocked by a wall at (8, 18)), the best action is to turn to face a direction where movement is possible. The agent is at the bottom edge, so turning left or right is necessary to explore the grid.\n\n### Optimal Action:\n- Turn left to face right (→) or turn right to face left (←). Given the agent is at the bottom edge, turning right (to face left) might be better to explore the grid towards the center.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this mission, we need to follow these steps:\n1.

This makes it difficult to pinpoint exact locations of the yellow room, blue key, blue door, and goal. However, we can infer general navigation rules:\n     - Walls (object_type=2) are impassable.\n     - Doors (object_type=4) may be open (state=0), closed (state=1), or locked (state=2).\n     - Keys (object_type=5) must be picked up (pickup action) to unlock doors of matching color.\n     - The agent must avoid lava (object_type=9).\n\n4. **Immediate Action**:\n   - Since the agent is facing right and not carrying anything, the first sub-goal is to find the yellow room and the blue key.

The agent must face the door and use the `toggle` action to unlock it (since it has the matching blue key).\n4. **Go to the goal**: After unlocking the door, the agent should proceed to the goal (`object_type=8`).\n\n### Current Action:\nSince the agent is not carrying anything and needs to explore to find the blue key, the first action should be to `move_forward` to start exploring the grid.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this problem, let's break down the mission into clear steps and analyze the given grid observation to determine the optimal actions.\n\n### Mission Breakdown:\n1. **Get the blue key from the yellow room**: \n   - The agent needs to locate and pick up a blue key (object_type=5, color=2 (blue)) in a yellow room (color=4 (yellow)).\n   \n2. **Unlock the blue door**:\n   - After obtaining the blue key, the agent needs to find a blue door (object_type=4, color=2 (blue), state=2 (locked)) and use the key to unlock it.\n\n3. **Go to the goal**:\n   - After unlocking the door, proceed to the goal (object_type=8).\n\n### Observations:\n- The agent is at (10, 5), facing right (→), and is not carrying anything.\n- The grid is 19x19, but the detailed observation is truncated (represented by \"...,\"). This means we cannot see the exact positions of the blue key, blue door, or goal. However, we can infer general strategies based on the mission and typical grid layouts.\n\n### Assumptions (due to truncated grid):\n1. **Yellow room**: Likely a bounded area with yellow-colored floors or walls. The blue key is inside this room.\n2. **Blue door**: A locked door (state=2) that requires the blue key to unlock.\n3. **Goal**: The final destination after unlocking the door.\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n1. **Locate the yellow room and enter it**:\n   - The agent must move towards the yellow room. Since the grid is truncated, we assume the yellow room is reachable by moving right (current direction) or after some turns.\n   - If the path is blocked (e.g., by walls or closed doors), the agent may need to turn or interact (e.g., toggle doors).\n\n2. **Pick up the blue key**:\n   - Once inside the yellow room, the agent must face the blue key and use the `pickup` action.\n\n3. **Locate and unlock the blue door**:\n   - After picking up the key, the agent must find the blue door, face it, and use the `toggle` action to unlock it (since the door is locked and the agent has the matching key).\n\n4. **Proceed to the goal**:\n   - After unlocking the door, move to the goal and use the `done` action.\n\n### Current Situation:\n- The agent is at (10, 5), facing right, and the grid is not fully visible. The immediate next cell to the right (11, 5) is not shown, but we can assume it is either empty or a door (since walls are explicitly marked).\n- Given the mission's urgency (19 steps remaining), the agent should prioritize moving towards the yellow room and the blue key.\n\n### Action Choice:\nSince the grid is truncated, the safest immediate action is to `move_forward` (right) to explore the next cell and gather more information. If the next cell is a wall or obstacle, the agent will need to adjust in subsequent steps.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this mission, we need to follow these steps:\n1. Get the blue key from the yellow room.\n2. Unlock the blue door.\n3. Go to the goal.\n\nGiven the agent is at (10, 5), facing right, and not carrying anything, the first step is to locate the blue key in the yellow room.

However, the observation provided is truncated and doesn't show the specific positions of these objects. \n\nAssuming the blue key is in the yellow room (likely a region with yellow-colored cells), the agent would need to:\n- Move towards the yellow room.\n- Locate and pick up the blue key.\n- Then, find the blue door (likely a door with color=2 (blue)) and use the key to unlock it.\n- Finally, proceed to the goal.\n\nSince the exact positions are not visible in the truncated observation, the immediate next step for the agent (facing right) would be to move forward to explore and locate the blue key in the yellow room. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this problem, I'll analyze the given mission and the grid observation to determine the optimal sequence of actions.

However, the mission implies these exist somewhere in the grid.\n\n5. **Action Plan**:\n   - Since the agent is not carrying anything, the first step is to locate and pick up the blue key from the yellow room.\n   - After obtaining the blue key, the agent should find the blue door, unlock it, and proceed to the goal.\n\n6. **Immediate Action**:\n   - Given the limited information in the observation snippet, the safest initial action is to move forward to explore the environment and gather more information about the locations of the yellow room, blue key, blue door, and goal.\n\nThus, the optimal first action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this problem, let's analyze the mission and the grid step by step.\n\n### Mission Breakdown:\n1. **Get the blue key from the yellow room**: The agent needs to locate and pick up a blue key (object_type=5, color=2) that is in a yellow room (color=4).\n2. **Unlock the blue door**: The agent must find a blue door (object_type=4, color=2, state=2 for locked) and use the blue key to unlock it (requires facing the door and using the `toggle` action after picking up the key).\n3. **Go to the goal**: After unlocking the door, the agent must navigate to the goal (object_type=8).\n\n### Observations:\n- The agent is at (10, 5), facing right (→).\n- The grid is large (19x19), and the observation is truncated, so we cannot see the full layout.

The most logical first step is to turn right to face upwards and move to (1, 1) to check for the key.\n\n### Current Action:\nThe agent cannot move forward while facing left (wall in front), so the first action is to turn right to face upwards.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Breakdown:\n1. **Use the key to open the door**: This implies we need to find a key, pick it up, and then use it to open a locked door.\n2. **Get to the goal**: After opening the door, we need to reach the goal.\n\n### Grid Analysis:\n- **Agent Position**: (1, 2), facing up (↑).\n- **Agent Status**: Not carrying anything.\n- **Key**: Looking at the grid, there is no key (`object_type=5`) visible in the observation. This suggests the key might be hidden or not present, but the mission requires using a key, so we might need to explore further.\n- **Door**: There is a door (`object_type=4`) at (2, 2). The state of the door is not explicitly given in the observation, but since the mission mentions opening the door, we can assume it is locked or closed.\n- **Goal**: The goal (`object_type=8`) is at (3, 3).\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n1. **Find the Key**: Since the key is not visible in the current observation, we might need to move around to find it. However, given the grid, it seems the key might not be present, or we might need to interact with other objects (like boxes or balls) to reveal it. For now, let's assume the key is not directly visible, and we need to proceed to the door.\n2. **Approach the Door**: The door is at (2, 2), which is to the right of the agent's current position (1, 2). The agent is facing up, so we need to turn right to face the door.\n   - Action: `turn_right` (now facing right).\n   - Action: `move_forward` (move to (2, 2)).\n3. **Open the Door**: Since the door is locked or closed, we need to use the `toggle` action to open it. However, we don't have a key, so this might fail. If it fails, we might need to backtrack or explore further.\n   - Action: `toggle` (attempt to open the door).\n4. **Reach the Goal**: After opening the door, we can move to the goal at (3, 3).\n   - Action: `move_forward` (move to (3, 2)).\n   - Action: `turn_right` (now facing down).\n   - Action: `move_forward` (move to (3, 3)).\n\n### Current Plan:\nGiven the lack of a visible key, the most immediate action is to turn right to face the door and then move forward to interact with it.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: turn_right","Let's analyze the grid and mission step by step:\n\n1.

The door is located at (2, 2), which is to the right of the agent's current position. However, the agent is currently facing up, so it needs to turn right to face the door.\n   - After opening the door, the agent needs to reach the goal at (3, 3).\n\n3. **Key Location**: There is no key visible in the grid, which suggests the agent might already have the key or the key is not present. However, the agent is not carrying anything, so this might be a missing piece of information. Assuming the agent needs to pick up a key first, but none is visible, this could be an issue.

The agent is facing up (↑), so moving forward would take it to (1, 1). However, (1, 1) is a wall (object_type=1, color=1, state=-1), so moving forward is not possible.\n2. The door is to the right of the agent (at (2, 2)). The agent needs to face the door to interact with it (toggle).\n3. Since the mission requires using a key, but no key is visible, this might be a puzzle where the key is hidden or the door can be toggled without a key. Alternatively, the grid might be incomplete.\n\n### Possible Steps:\n1. Turn right to face the door (currently facing up, turning right would face the agent to the right).\n2. Move forward to approach the door.\n3. Toggle the door to open it.\n4.

From the observation, the key is not visible in the immediate vicinity, so we need to explore the grid to find it. However, in the given grid, there is no key present (object_type=5 is not found in any cell). This suggests that the key might be missing or not placed in the grid, which is unusual for the given mission.\n\n2. **Open the door**: The door is located at (2, 2) (object_type=4, color=2 (blue), state=2 (locked)). Since the door is locked, we need a matching key (blue key) to open it. Without the key, we cannot proceed through the door.\n\n3. **Reach the goal**: The goal is at (3, 3) (object_type=8, color=3 (purple)). To reach the goal, we must pass through the locked door at (2, 2), but without the key, this is impossible.\n\nGiven the current observation, it appears the mission cannot be completed because the required key is not present in the grid.

Since we cannot see the key, we might need to move forward to uncover more of the grid.\n\n2. **Open the Door**: There is a door at (2, 2). The door is currently closed or locked (state is 2, which means locked). To open it, we need a key of the same color as the door. The door's color is not specified in the observation, but assuming it requires a key, we need to find and pick up the key first.\n\n3. **Reach the Goal**: The goal is at (3, 3).

Then go back to the door at (2,2)\n   - From (0,1), move right to (1,1), then down to (1,2), then right to (2,2)\n3. Use the key to open the door\n4. Proceed to goal at (3,3)\n\nImmediate next action:\n- To face the key at (0,1), we need to turn left (from current right-facing direction)\n\nAnswer: turn_left","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Breakdown:\n1. **Use the key to open the door**: \n   - First, we need to find and pick up the key. \n   - Then, we need to find the door and use the key to open it (if the door is locked) or toggle it (if the door is closed).\n2. **Get to the goal**: \n   - After the door is open, we need to navigate to the goal.\n\n### Grid Analysis:\n- **Agent Position**: (1, 1), facing up (↑).\n- **Key**: There is no key visible in the grid (no cell with object_type=5). This suggests the key might be hidden or not present, but since the mission mentions \"use the key,\" we must assume it exists. However, based on the given grid, there is no key to pick up. This might be an oversight, but we'll proceed with the assumption that the door is closed (not locked) and can be toggled without a key.\n- **Door**: Located at (2, 2), object_type=4 (DOOR). The state is not explicitly given, but since the mission mentions \"open the door,\" we assume it is closed (state=1) or locked (state=2).

Toggle the door to open it.\n3. After the door is open, move forward to (2, 3).\n4. Turn left to face right (→).\n5. Move forward to (3, 3) (the goal).\n\n### Actions:\n1. `turn_right` (now facing right).\n2. `move_forward` (to (2, 1)).\n3. `turn_right` (now facing down).\n4. `move_forward` (to (2, 2)).\n5. `toggle` (open the door).\n6. `move_forward` (to (2, 3)).\n7. `turn_left` (now facing right).\n8. `move_forward` (to (3, 3)).\n9. `done` (goal reached).\n\n### Next Action:\nThe first action is to turn right to face the direction we need to move toward the door.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this mission, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Locate the key**: The key is needed to open the locked door. From the observation, the key is not visible in the immediate vicinity, so we need to explore further.\n2. **Open the door**: Once the key is obtained, we need to use it to open the locked door at (2, 2).\n3. **Reach the goal**: After the door is open, we can proceed to the goal located at (3, 3).\n\n### Current Observation Analysis:\n- The agent is at (1, 1), facing right (→).\n- The grid shows a locked door at (2, 2) (object_type=4, state=2).\n- The goal is at (3, 3) (object_type=8).\n- There is no key visible in the observation, which suggests the key might be in one of the cells marked as \"-1\" (unknown or not provided in the observation). However, since the observation is incomplete, we will assume the key is not in the visible cells and must be found elsewhere.\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n1. **Move forward to (2, 1)**: The agent is at (1, 1) facing right, so moving forward will take it to (2, 1).\n2. **Turn right to face down**: At (2, 1), the agent should turn right to face down (towards (2, 2)).\n3. **Move forward to (2, 2)**: The agent will now be in front of the locked door at (2, 2).\n4. **Pick up the key**: If the key is at (2, 2), the agent can pick it up. However, since the key is not visible in the observation, this step might not be possible. Assuming the key is elsewhere, we need to explore further.\n5. **Open the door**: Once the key is obtained, the agent can toggle the door to open it.\n6. **Move to the goal**: After the door is open, the agent can move to (2, 3), then (3, 3) to reach the goal.\n\nGiven the incomplete observation, the immediate next step is to move forward to (2, 1).\n\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this mission, let's analyze the grid and plan the optimal sequence of actions:\n\n1. **Current Position & Orientation**: Agent is at (1,1), facing right (→). Not carrying anything.\n\n2. **Key Location**: There is no key visible in the immediate observation area. However, the grid shows a door (object_type=4) at (2,2). Since the mission mentions \"use the key to open the door,\" we can infer there must be a key somewhere, but it's not visible in the current observation. This suggests the observation might be incomplete or the key is hidden behind other objects.\n\n3. **Goal Location**: The goal (object_type=8) is at (3,3).\n\n4. **Door Status**: The door at (2,2) is locked (state=2), as indicated by the \"-1\" in the state field (assuming this is a placeholder for locked state).\n\nGiven the current observation and the mission, here's the optimal plan:\n- First, we need to find and pick up the key to unlock the door. However, since the key is not visible in the current observation, we might need to explore further.\n- Since the agent is facing right and there is a wall to the right (at (2,1)), the immediate action should be to turn to face another direction where the key might be located. The most likely direction is down (towards (1,2)), as (1,2) and (1,3) are marked as \"-1\", which might indicate explorable areas.\n\nHowever, since the grid is incomplete (many cells are marked \"-1\"), we can only make an educated guess based on the mission. The most logical immediate action is to turn to face the door (downwards) to prepare for interaction.\n\nGiven the limited information, the safest immediate action is to turn right to face downwards (towards the door at (2,2)).\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Let's analyze the grid and mission step by step:\n\n1. Current Position: Agent is at (1,1) facing down (direction=1)\n2. Mission Requirements:\n   - Use a key to open a door\n   - Then reach the goal (which is at (3,3))\n\nObservation details:\n- The door is at (2,2) - it's a locked door (state=2) since it's type 4 (DOOR) with state=2\n- There's a key somewhere (we need to find its location)\n- The goal is at (3,3)\n\nLooking at the grid:\n- The key must be in one of the cells marked with -1 (unknown state)\n- Checking positions:\n  - (1,2) and (1,3) are unknown in the first column\n  - (3,1) and (3,2) are unknown in the third column\n\nMost likely path:\n1. First we need to find and pick up the key\n2. Then go to the door at (2,2)\n3. Unlock the door\n4. Proceed to the goal at (3,3)\n\nLooking at the unknown cells, the most accessible one is (1,2) directly below the agent.\n\nAction sequence:\n1. move_forward (to (1,2)) - might reveal the key\n2. If key is there, pick it up\n3. Otherwise continue searching\n\nFirst action should be move_forward to (1,2) to explore.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Let's analyze the grid and mission step by step.\n\n1. Current Position: Agent is at (1,2) facing down (↓)\n2. Mission: Use key to open door → get to goal\n3. Observations:\n   - There's a door at (2,2) directly below the agent (since facing down)\n   - The goal is at (3,3)\n   - No keys are visible in the immediate observation\n   - The door at (2,2) appears to be locked (state=2)\n\nFirst, we need to find a key. Looking at the grid:\n- (1,1) and (1,3) have object_type=-1 (unknown, possibly containing key)\n- (3,1) and (3,2) also have object_type=-1\n\nSince we're facing down, the most efficient path would be:\n1. Move forward to (1,3) to check for key\n2. If no key, turn right and check other positions\n\nBut looking at the grid more carefully, the agent is at (1,2) facing down, and (1,3) is directly ahead. Let's first check this cell.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Breakdown:\n1. **Use the key to open the door**: This implies we need to find a key, pick it up, then use it on a locked door.\n2. **Get to the goal**: After opening the door, reach the goal (which is at (3, 3)).\n\n### Observation Analysis:\n- **Agent Position**: (1, 3), facing down (↓).\n- **Agent Status**: Not carrying anything.\n- **Key**: There is no key visible in the grid (no cell with object_type=5). This suggests the key might be hidden or not present, but the mission requires using a key, so we must assume it's somewhere accessible or the grid is incomplete.\n- **Door**: At (2, 2), object_type=4 (DOOR). The state is not explicitly given, but since the mission says \"open the door,\" we can assume it's locked (state=2).\n- **Goal**: At (3, 3), object_type=8 (GOAL).\n\n### Path to Solve:\n1. Since there's no visible key, the only logical step is to move toward the door to check if the key is nearby or if the door can be interacted with directly.\n2. From (1, 3), facing down, the agent can move forward to (1, 4), but (1, 4) is a wall (object_type=2), so movement is blocked.\n3. The agent must turn to face another direction. Turning right would face the agent left (since facing down, turning right changes direction to left).\n4. After turning right, the agent would face left (←) and can move forward to (0, 3), but (0, 3) is also a wall.\n5. The only other option is to turn left from the initial position (facing down → turn left to face right (→)).\n6. Facing right, the agent can move forward to (2, 3), which is a wall (object_type=2), so blocked.\n7. The agent is stuck in a corner with no immediate moves. This suggests the grid may be unsolvable as given, but since the mission requires using a key, we must assume the key is at (1, 2) or (3, 2) (hidden or not shown in the observation).\n\n### Optimal Action:\nGiven the constraints, the only possible action is to turn left to face right (→) and attempt to move toward the door or key. Since the grid doesn't show the key, we must proceed toward the door.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: turn_left","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Breakdown:\n1. **Use the key to open the door**: This implies we need to find a key, pick it up, and then use it to open a locked door.\n2. **Get to the goal**: After opening the door, we need to reach the goal.\n\n### Grid Analysis:\n- **Agent Position**: (1, 3), facing right (→).\n- **Agent Status**: Not carrying anything.\n- **Key (object_type=5)**: There is no key visible in the grid.

The state is not explicitly given, but since the mission says to open the door, we can assume it's locked (state=2).\n- **Goal (object_type=8)**: Located at (3, 3).\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n1. **Find the Key**: Since the key is not visible in the current observation, we might need to move to uncover more of the grid. However, given the grid size and the mission, it's possible the key is in an adjacent cell not yet visible.\n2. **Open the Door**: Once the key is picked up, move to the door at (2, 2) and use the `toggle` action to open it.\n3. **Reach the Goal**: After the door is open, move to the goal at (3, 3).\n\n### Immediate Action:\nGiven the agent is at (1, 3) facing right, the cell to its right is (2, 3), which is a wall (object_type=2). Moving forward is not possible. The next logical action is to turn to face another direction to explore further.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n1. **Turn Left**: To face upwards (since turning right would face the agent downwards, which might not be optimal).\n2. **Move Forward**: After turning, move forward to explore the grid further.\n\nHowever, since the grid is fully visible (5x5), and there's no key present, this suggests the key might be in a cell that's not visible or the grid is incomplete. Given the current observation, the only actionable step is to turn to face another direction.\n\n### Final Decision:\nSince the agent cannot move forward (blocked by a wall), the best immediate action is to turn left to face upwards and then move forward in the next step to explore further.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","Let's analyze the grid and mission step by step:\n\n1.

The key must be somewhere else on the grid, but it is not visible in the current observation. This suggests we need to explore further to find the key.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Since we cannot move left (wall), the only immediate option is to move down to (1, 2).\n2. From (1, 2), we can explore further to find the key.

The cell to its right (1, 2) is empty (object_type -1, which seems to be a placeholder for empty or invalid).\n  - The cell (2, 2) contains a door (object_type 4). The door's state is not explicitly given in the observation, but since the mission mentions \"use the key to open the door,\" we can infer it is locked (state 2).\n  - There is no key visible in the immediate vicinity. The grid does not show any key (object_type 5) in the provided observation.\n  - The goal is at (3, 3) (object_type 8).\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n1. **Find the Key**: Since no key is visible in the observation, it might be hidden or not present in the provided grid snippet. However, the mission requires using a key, so we must assume the key is somewhere accessible (possibly in the empty cells marked -1, but this is unclear).\n   - Given the limited steps (3 remaining), it's impossible to search for the key, pick it up, go to the door, and open it within 3 steps. This suggests the initial observation might be incomplete or the mission is impossible with the given steps.\n   - Alternatively, the key might already be in the agent's inventory, but the status says \"not carrying anything.\"\n\n2. **Alternative Interpretation**: If the door at (2, 2) is closed but not locked (state 1), we could \"toggle\" it to open. However, the mission explicitly says \"use the key to open the door,\" implying the door is locked.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWith the given observation and only 3 steps remaining, it is impossible to complete the mission (\"use the key to open the door and then get to the goal\") because:\n- No key is visible in the grid.\n- Even if the key were nearby, picking it up, moving to the door, and toggling it would take more than 3 steps.\n- The goal is behind the door, which cannot be opened without the key.\n\n### Final Answer:\nSince the mission cannot be completed with the given steps and observation, the only logical action is to end the attempt. \n\nAnswer: done","Let's analyze the grid and mission step by step:\n\n1.

This means the agent's forward direction is to the right (towards increasing x-coordinate).\n\n2. **Mission**: The mission is to use the key to open the door and then get to the goal. \n\n3. **Key Location**: There is a key (object_type=5) at (1, 3), which is directly below the agent (since the agent is at (1, 2)). However, the agent is facing right, so it needs to turn to face the key first.\n\n4. **Door Location**: There is a door (object_type=4) at (2, 1). The door is locked (state=2), so the agent needs a key to open it. The key at (1, 3) is likely the one needed (assuming color matching, though color info is not fully clear here).\n\n5. **Goal Location**: The goal (object_type=8) is at (3, 3). After opening the door, the agent needs to navigate to this goal.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n1. Turn left to face down (towards increasing y-coordinate) to pick up the key at (1, 3).\n2. Pick up the key.\n3. Turn right to face right again (towards the door at (2, 1)).\n4. Move forward to (2, 2) (but this is a wall, so this seems incorrect. Wait, the agent is at (1, 2), facing right, so moving forward would take it to (2, 2), which is a wall. Hmm, this suggests the initial plan may not work.)\n   \n   Wait, let's re-examine:\n   - The agent is at (1, 2), facing right. The door is at (2, 1), which is up and to the right. The agent cannot reach the door directly from its current position because (2, 2) is a wall. So, the agent must first go down to (1, 3) to pick up the key, then go back up to (1, 1), then right to (2, 1) to unlock the door.\n\n   Revised plan:\n   1. Turn left to face down (towards increasing y-coordinate).\n   2. Move forward to (1, 3) to pick up the key.\n   3. Turn left to face left (towards decreasing x-coordinate).\n   4. Move forward to (1, 2).\n   5. Turn left to face up (towards decreasing y-coordinate).\n   6. Move forward to (1, 1).\n   7. Turn right to face right (towards increasing x-coordinate).\n   8. Move forward to (2, 1).\n   9. Toggle to unlock the door.\n   10. Move forward to (2, 1) (door is now open).\n   11. Turn right to face down.\n   12. Move forward to (2, 2) (but this is a wall, so this seems wrong. Maybe the door is at (2,1), and after opening, the agent can move to (2,1), then turn down to face (2,2), but (2,2) is a wall. This suggests the goal is not reachable this way. Maybe the door is at (2,1), and the agent needs to go around.)\n\n   This seems too convoluted. Maybe the initial approach is better: pick up the key, then go to the door.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the door is at (2,1), and the agent can reach it by:\n   - From (1,2), turn left to face down, move to (1,3), pick up key.\n   - Turn right to face right, move to (2,3) (but this is a wall).\n   - Turn right to face up, move to (2,2) (wall).\n   - This seems stuck.

We should move forward to pick it up.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n1. **Current Position & Orientation**: The agent is at (1, 1), facing up (↑). This means the cell directly above the agent is (1, 0).\n\n2. **Observation**:\n   - The cell above the agent (1, 0) is a WALL (object_type=1, color=0, state=2), so the agent cannot move there.\n   - The cell to the right (2, 1) is a DOOR (object_type=4). The color is not specified in the observation, but the state is likely locked or closed (since the mission mentions using a key to open the door).\n   - The cell below the agent (1, 2) is empty (object_type=-1), so the agent can move there.\n   - The cell to the left (0, 1) is a WALL (object_type=1), so the agent cannot move there.\n   - The cell at (1, 3) contains a KEY (object_type=5). The color is not specified, but it is likely the key needed to open the door.\n   - The goal is at (3, 3) (object_type=8).\n\n3. **Mission Steps**:\n   - First, the agent needs to pick up the key at (1, 3).\n   - Then, the agent needs to open the door at (2, 1) using the key.\n   - Finally, the agent needs to reach the goal at (3, 3).\n\n4. **Plan**:\n   - The agent is currently facing up, but the key is below the agent. The agent needs to turn to face downward to move toward the key.\n   - After picking up the key, the agent needs to go back up to the door at (2, 1), open it, and then proceed to the goal.\n\n### Step-by-Step Actions:\n1. The agent is facing up, but the key is below. Turn to face downward:\n   - `turn_left` (to face left) → `turn_left` (to face down). Alternatively, `turn_right` twice would also work, but `turn_left` twice is more straightforward here.\n   - After two `turn_left` actions, the agent will be facing down.\n\n2. Move down to (1, 2):\n   - `move_forward` (now facing down, moves to (1, 2)).\n\n3. Move down to (1, 3) to pick up the key:\n   - `move_forward` (to (1, 3)).\n   - `pickup` (collect the key).\n\n4. Now, the agent needs to go back up to the door at (2, 1). To do this:\n   - Turn to face up: `turn_left` (to face right) → `turn_left` (to face up).\n   - `move_forward` (to (1, 2)).\n   - `move_forward` (to (1, 1)).\n\n5.

The agent must use the \"toggle\" action to open it (assuming the key matches the door color; in this case, the door's color is not specified, but the mission implies the key is correct).\n4. **Reach the Goal**: After opening the door, the agent can move forward to (2, 1), turn right to face right (→), move forward to (3, 1), turn right to face down (↓), and move forward to (3, 3) to reach the goal.\n\n### Immediate Next Action:\nThe first step is to move forward to (1, 3) to pick up the key. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","Let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n1. **Agent Position and Orientation**: The agent is at (1, 2), facing down (↓). This means the cell directly below the agent is (1, 3).\n\n2. **Observation of (1, 3)**: The cell at (1, 3) contains [1, 3, 5], which translates to:\n   - object_type: 5 (KEY)\n   - color: 3 (PURPLE)\n   - state: 0 (irrelevant for keys)\n\n3. **Mission Requirements**: \n   - \"use the key to open the door and then get to the goal\"\n   - The door is at (2, 1) (object_type: 4 (DOOR), color: 1 (GREEN), state: likely locked or closed since we need to use a key).\n   - The goal is at (3, 3) (object_type: 8 (GOAL), color: not specified but likely matches the mission).\n\n4. **Current Step**:\n   - The agent is not carrying anything, and the key is directly below it at (1, 3).\n   - The first action should be to pick up the key.\n\n5. **Next Steps After Picking Up the Key**:\n   - After picking up the key, the agent will need to navigate to the door at (2, 1).\n   - The door is to the right and up from the agent's current position.\n   - The agent will need to turn left (to face right), move forward to (2, 2), turn left (to face up), move forward to (2, 1), and then toggle the door to open it.\n   - After the door is open, the agent can proceed to the goal at (3, 3).\n\n6. **Immediate Action**:\n   - The key is directly below the agent, so the agent can move forward to (1, 3) and then pick it up. However, since the agent is already at (1, 2) and the key is at (1, 3), the first action should be to move forward to reach the key.\n\nBut wait, the agent is facing down (↓), and the key is at (1, 3), which is directly below the agent. So the agent can move forward to (1, 3) and then pick up the key. However, the action space includes \"pickup\" which can be used to pick up the key without moving forward if the key is adjacent (but in this case, the key is directly in front).\n\nBut looking at the grid, the agent is at (1, 2), and the key is at (1, 3), which is directly in front (since the agent is facing down). So the correct first action is to move forward to (1, 3), then pick up the key.\n\nBut the action \"pickup\" can pick up the key without moving if it's adjacent, but here it's directly in front, so we need to move forward first.\n\nWait, no: the \"pickup\" action can pick up items in adjacent cells (not just the cell the agent is in), but typically it's for the cell the agent is facing. So the agent can \"pickup\" the key at (1, 3) without moving forward first, because it's directly in front.\n\nSo the first action should be \"pickup\" to pick up the key at (1, 3).\n\nThen the next steps would be:\n- turn_left (to face right)\n- move_forward (to (2, 2))\n- turn_left (to face up)\n- move_forward (to (2, 1))\n- toggle (to open the door)\n- turn_right (to face right)\n- move_forward (to (3, 1))\n- turn_right (to face down)\n- move_forward (to (3, 2))\n- move_forward (to (3, 3))\n- done\n\nBut for now, the first action is to pick up the key.\n\nAnswer: pickup","To solve this mission, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Locate the key**: The key is needed to open the locked door. From the observation, the key is not visible in the immediate vicinity, so we need to explore the grid to find it. However, in the given grid, there is no key present. This suggests that the key might be in a different part of the grid not shown here, or it might be missing. But based on the provided grid, we can proceed under the assumption that the key is not present or is already picked up (though the status says \"not carrying anything\").\n\n2. **Open the door**: The door is at position (2, 1) (third row, second column). The door is currently closed or locked (state is not explicitly given, but the mission mentions \"use the key to open the door,\" implying it is locked). Since we don't have the key, we cannot open the door yet. \n\n3. **Reach the goal**: The goal is at position (3, 3) (fourth row, fourth column). To reach the goal, we need to navigate around the door or open it if possible.\n\nGiven the current observation and the agent's position at (1, 2) facing down (↓), the immediate next step is to move forward to (1, 3). However, (1, 3) is marked as -1, which seems to be an invalid or impassable cell (possibly a wall or obstacle). Therefore, moving forward is not possible.\n\nThe next best action is to turn right to face left (←) and then move forward to (0, 2), but (0, 2) is a wall (object_type 2), so that's not possible either. \n\nAlternatively, turning left would face the agent right (→), and moving forward would take us to (2, 2), which is a wall (object_type 2). \n\nGiven these constraints, the only possible action is to turn right to change the agent's direction, but since no immediate movement is possible, the best action is to turn right to reorient the agent for future moves.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Let me analyze the grid and plan the optimal sequence of actions to complete the mission.\n\n1.

This means the cell directly below the agent is (1, 3).\n\n2. **Observation of (1, 3)**: The cell at (1, 3) has `[1, 1, -1]`. The object_type is 1 (EMPTY), so the agent can move forward to (1, 3).\n\n3. **Mission Requirements**: \n   - The mission is to \"use the key to open the door and then get to the goal.\"\n   - First, we need to find a key. Looking at the grid, there is a key at (0, 1) with `[5, 0, 0]` (KEY, RED).\n   - Next, we need to find a door. There is a door at (2, 1) with `[4, 1, 2]` (DOOR, GREEN, locked). The door is locked (state=2), so we need a matching key (color=1, GREEN). However, the key at (0, 1) is RED, so it doesn't match the GREEN door. This suggests there might be another key or door, but the grid doesn't show any other keys or doors.\n   - The goal is at (3, 3) with `[8, 0, 0]` (GOAL, RED).\n\n4. **Possible Issue**: The mission mentions using a key to open a door, but the only key (RED) doesn't match the only door (GREEN). This might be a mistake in the grid or mission description. Assuming the mission is correct, perhaps the door is supposed to be RED, or the key is supposed to be GREEN. Alternatively, the mission might be referring to the RED key and the RED goal (though the goal is not a door).\n\n5. **Alternative Interpretation**: If the mission is to \"use the key to open the door and then get to the goal,\" and the only key is RED, perhaps the door is supposed to be RED. Alternatively, the mission might imply that the key is not needed for the door (but the door is locked, so it is needed). Given the grid, the only actionable path seems to be:\n   - Pick up the RED key at (0, 1).\n   - Since the door is GREEN and the key is RED, we cannot open the door. This suggests the mission might be unsolvable as given.\n\n6. **Assuming the Door is RED**: If we assume the door at (2, 1) is RED (color=0) instead of GREEN (color=1), then the steps would be:\n   - Move to (1, 3) (empty cell below).\n   - Turn left to face right (→).\n   - Move to (2, 3).\n   - Turn left to face up (↑).\n   - Move to (2, 2) (wall, cannot move).\n   - This path doesn't help. Alternatively:\n   - From (1, 2), turn right to face left (←).\n   - Move to (0, 2) (wall, cannot move).\n   - This also doesn't help.\n\n7. **Alternative Path to Goal**: Since the door is GREEN and the key is RED, and they don't match, the only way to the goal is to avoid the door. However, the goal is at (3, 3), and the path to it is blocked by walls or the locked door. The agent cannot reach the goal without opening the door, but the key doesn't match.\n\n8. **Conclusion**: Given the grid and mission as provided, the mission seems unsolvable because the key (RED) doesn't match the door (GREEN). However, if we ignore the door and try to reach the goal, the path is blocked. The only possible action is to move forward to (1, 3), which doesn't help.\n\nGiven the constraints, the best immediate action is to move forward to (1, 3).\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Let me analyze the grid and plan the optimal sequence of actions to complete the mission:\n\n1.

Directly above is (1,0), which is empty (object_type 1).\n\n2. **Key & Door Situation**: \n   - There's a door at (2,1) (right of the agent). The door is type 4 (DOOR), but we don't know its state from the observation (state value is missing here, but the mission implies it's locked or closed).\n   - There's a key somewhere - but it's not visible in the current observation (no cell with object_type 5). This suggests the key might be in one of the cells marked with '-1' (invalid\/unobserved data).\n\n3. **Goal Location**: The goal is at (3,3), but it's behind walls\/doors.\n\n**Optimal Path Analysis**:\n- First, we need to find and pick up the key. Since the key isn't visible, we should explore the '-1' cells (likely hidden information).\n- The closest '-1' cells are at (1,2) and (1,3) (below the agent). Since the agent is facing up, we should turn to face down first.\n\n**Next Action**:\n- To face downward, the agent needs to turn_right (from up to right, then right again to down, but more efficient to turn_left once to face left, then left again to face down - but simplest is two turn_rights). Actually, from up (3), one turn_right would face right (0), another would face down (1). So two turn_rights are needed to face down.\n\nBut looking at the action space, the most straightforward way is to turn_right twice to face down.\n\nHowever, since the agent is at (1,1) and the door is at (2,1) to its right, perhaps the key is behind the door. But since we don't have the key, we must find it first. Given the incomplete observation, the safest assumption is that the key is in one of the '-1' cells below the agent.\n\nThus, the first action should be to turn to face downward to explore (1,2).\n\n**Action Sequence**:\n1. turn_right (to face right)\n2. move_forward (to (2,1) - the door)\nBut since we don't have the key, this might not help. Alternatively:\n1. turn_left (to face left)\nBut left is a wall at (0,1). \n\nGiven the uncertainty, the most reasonable first action is to turn_right to face right (toward the door at (2,1)), then we can assess further.\n\nBut since the mission says \"use the key to open the door\", and we don't see the key, perhaps the key is at (1,2) or (1,3). So the first action should be to face down to explore those.\n\nThus, the first action is turn_right (to face right), then another turn_right to face down.\n\nBut since we can only output one action at a time, the first action is turn_right.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Let me analyze the grid and mission step by step.\n\n1.

If we treat (2,1) as a door (type 4) despite the object_type being 2, then:\n\n1. We need a key matching the door's color (green)\n2. But there's no green key visible in the grid\n3. The goal is at (3,3) behind this door\n\nGiven the mission says \"use the key\", I'll assume there must be a key somewhere, perhaps in one of the cells marked [-1,-1,-1] which might be obscured. \n\nThe immediate action would be to move towards where a key might be, but since none are visible and the door is directly to our right, the only possible action is to try to interact with it.\n\nGiven the confusion in the observation, the safest immediate action is to attempt to interact with the door to our right.\n\nAnswer: toggle","To solve this mission, we need to follow these steps:\n1. Locate the key (if not already in inventory).\n2. Use the key to open the locked door.\n3.

However, since the mission states \"use the key,\" we can assume the key is already present in the agent's vicinity or inventory, but the status shows \"not carrying anything.\"\n\nGiven the current observation and the mission, the immediate action is to move forward to the door at (2, 1) and then interact with it. However, since the door might be locked (state=2), we need a key. Since no key is visible and the agent is not carrying one, this suggests the key might be in an unobserved cell. But since the grid is fully provided, and no key is present, this might be an oversight.\n\nGiven the grid:\n- The only interactable objects are the door at (2, 1) and the goal at (3, 3).\n- The door is directly to the right of the agent.\n\nAssuming the door is locked (state=2), and no key is present, the agent cannot proceed. However, if the door is closed (state=1), the agent can toggle it open. Since the state is not explicitly given, but the mission says \"use the key,\" it is likely locked.\n\nGiven the lack of a key in the observation, the only logical step is to move forward to the door at (2, 1).\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n1. **Agent Position and Orientation**: The agent is at (2, 1), facing right (→).

It is currently closed (state=1). To open it, the agent needs a key of the same color (color=1, GREEN).\n   - Get to the goal: The goal (object_type=8) is at (3, 3).\n\n3. **Key Location**: The key (object_type=5) is at (1, 1), with color=1 (GREEN), matching the door's color.

This seems stuck, but wait—the agent can turn left to face up (↑), then move forward to (2, 1) (the door), but the door is closed and cannot be passed.\n   - The correct sequence is to turn right to face down (↓), then move forward to (4, 1) (but it's a WALL), so this seems impossible. Wait, perhaps the grid is 0-indexed differently. Let me re-examine the coordinates.\n\n   Rechecking coordinates: The agent is at (3, 1), facing left (←). The cell to its left is (3, 0), which is a WALL. The cell above is (2, 1), which is the DOOR. The cell below is (4, 1), which is a WALL. The cell to the right is (3, 2), which is EMPTY (object_type=-1, likely FLOOR). \n\n   So the agent can move right to (3, 2), then down to (4, 2), then left to (4, 1), but (4, 1) is a WALL. This seems convoluted. \n\n   The key is at (1, 1). From (3, 1), the agent can:\n   - Turn right to face down (↓), then turn right to face left (←), then move forward to (3, 0) (WALL). Not helpful.\n   - Turn left to face up (↑), then move forward to (2, 1) (DOOR). The door is closed, so the agent cannot pass, but it can interact with the door (toggle) if it has the key. But the agent doesn't have the key yet.\n\n   Wait, the key is at (1, 1). The agent must first go to (1, 1) to pick up the key. From (3, 1), the path is:\n   - Turn left to face up (↑), then move forward to (2, 1) (DOOR). The door is closed, so the agent cannot pass, but it can toggle the door if it has the key.

To reach the key at (1, 1), the agent needs to:\n   - Turn left to face left (since it's currently facing down, turning left will make it face right, but actually, the agent's direction is down (1), so turning left will face it to the right (0), but this seems confusing. Let me re-analyze the direction: the agent's color\/direction is 1 (down). Turning left from down will face the agent to the right (since down is 1, left is 2, up is 3, right is 0). So turning left from down (1) will face the agent to the right (0). This seems incorrect. Wait, the direction mapping is: 0=right, 1=down, 2=left, 3=up. So turning left from down (1) will face the agent to the right (0)? No, turning left from down should face the agent to the right (0), but that doesn't make sense because left from down should be right. This seems inconsistent. Maybe the direction after turning left from down (1) is left (2). Let me assume that turning left from down (1) will face the agent to the right (0), which is counter-intuitive but possible given the mapping. Alternatively, perhaps the direction is represented as 0=right, 1=down, 2=left, 3=up, and turning left subtracts 1 (mod 4), so turning left from down (1) would be right (0). This seems odd, but let's proceed with that.\n   - To face left (2), the agent needs to turn left twice from down (1): first turn left to face right (0), then turn left to face up (3), then turn left to face left (2). This seems inefficient. Alternatively, turning right from down (1) would face the agent to the left (2) (since turning right adds 1 mod 4: down (1) -> left (2)). So the agent should turn right to face left.\n   - After turning right, the agent will face left (2). Then it can move forward to (2, 1), then move forward again to (1, 1) to pick up the key.\n3. **Open the door**: The door is at (2, 1). After picking up the key, the agent needs to go back to (2, 1) and use the key to open the door (toggle action).\n4. **Reach the goal**: The goal is at (3, 3). After opening the door, the agent can move to (3, 1), then (3, 2), then (3, 3) to reach the goal.\n\n### Step-by-step actions:\n1. Turn right (to face left).\n2. Move forward (to (2, 1)).\n3.

This suggests the key might be behind the locked door, making the mission impossible with the current observation.\n\nHowever, looking carefully at the grid:\n- The door at (2,1) is type 4 (DOOR), but its state isn't specified in the observation (should be in the third value of its cell, which shows [2,1,4] - meaning object_type=2 (WALL), color=1 (GREEN), state=4 (invalid for WALL)). This appears to be an inconsistency in the observation data.\n\nGiven this inconsistency and the lack of visible key, the agent cannot proceed to complete the mission.

The door is at (5, 4), which is two cells to the right (x+2) and one cell down (y+1) from the agent's current position (3, 3).\n2.

This means the agent is looking towards increasing x-coordinates (east direction).\n2. **Door Location**: From the grid, the door is located at (5, 4) (object_type=4, state=1 or 2). The agent is currently at (4, 3), so the door is to the right and slightly below the agent.\n3. **Path to the Door**:\n   - The agent needs to move right (increase x-coordinate) to reach the door. However, the agent is currently at (4, 3), and the door is at (5, 4). The agent must first move forward to (5, 3), then turn right (to face down), and then move forward to (5, 4) to face the door.\n   - Alternatively, the agent could turn right (to face down), move forward to (4, 4), then turn left (to face right), and move forward to (5, 4). This is also a valid path but involves more steps.\n4. **Door State**: The door at (5, 4) has state=1 (closed) or state=2 (locked). Since the mission is to \"open the door,\" we assume it is closed (state=1) and can be opened with a \"toggle\" action. If it were locked (state=2), the agent would need a key, but there is no key in the immediate vicinity (the key at (2, 4) is too far and not along the path).\n5. **Optimal Path**: The shortest path is:\n   - Move forward to (5, 3).\n   - Turn right to face down.\n   - Move forward to (5, 4) (now facing the door).\n   - Toggle to open the door.\n\n### Current Step:\nThe agent is at (4, 3), facing right. The first action is to move forward to (5, 3).\n\n### Answer:\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission: Open the door\nFrom the observation, the agent is at position (4, 3), facing right (→). The grid shows a door at position (5, 4) (object_type=4, state=2, which means it's locked). There is a key at position (2, 4) (object_type=5). \n\n### Steps to complete the mission:\n1. The agent needs to pick up the key at (2, 4) first because the door is locked.\n2. After picking up the key, the agent needs to move to the door at (5, 4) and use the \"toggle\" action to open it.\n\n### Path to the key:\n- Current position: (4, 3), facing right.\n- The key is at (2, 4), which is two cells to the left and one cell up from the agent's current position.\n- To reach the key, the agent needs to:\n  - Turn left to face up (since the agent is facing right, turning left will make it face up).\n  - Move forward to (4, 2).\n  - Turn left to face left.\n  - Move forward to (3, 2).\n  - Move forward to (2, 2).\n  - Turn right to face up.\n  - Move forward to (2, 3).\n  - Move forward to (2, 4).\n  - Pick up the key.\n\nHowever, looking at the grid, the cells around the agent seem to be walls or invalid (marked with -1 or 2). The agent cannot move directly up from (4, 3) because (4, 2) is a wall (object_type=2). \n\n### Alternative path:\n- The agent is at (4, 3), facing right.\n- The cell to the right (5, 3) is a wall (object_type=2), so the agent cannot move forward.\n- The cell below (4, 4) is empty (object_type=-1), so the agent can move down.\n- Therefore, the agent should:\n  - Turn right to face down.\n  - Move forward to (4, 4).\n  - Turn left to face right.\n  - Move forward to (5, 4) (but this is the door, and it's locked, so the agent cannot move through it yet).\n  \nThis seems like a dead end. Let's re-examine the grid.\n\n### Re-examining the grid:\nThe key is at (2, 4), and the agent is at (4, 3). The agent can:\n1. Turn left to face up.\n2. Cannot move forward (wall at (4, 2)).\n3. Turn right to face right.\n4. Cannot move forward (wall at (5, 3)).\n5. Turn right to face down.\n6. Move forward to (4, 4).\n7. Now, the key is at (2, 4), which is two cells to the left.\n   - Turn left to face right.\n   - Cannot move forward (door at (5, 4)).\n   - Turn left to face up.\n   - Cannot move forward (wall at (4, 3)).\n   - Turn left to face left.\n   - Move forward to (3, 4).\n   - Move forward to (2, 4).\n   - Pick up the key.\n\nThis seems feasible. \n\n### Next steps after picking up the key:\n1. Turn right to face down.\n2. Move forward to (2, 5) (but this is a wall, so invalid).\n3. Turn right to face left.\n4. Already facing left.\n5. Move forward to (3, 4).\n6. Move forward to (4, 4).\n7. Turn right to face down.\n8. Move forward to (4, 5) (wall, invalid).\n9. Turn right to face left.\n10. Move forward to (3, 4).\n11. Turn right to face up.\n12. Move forward to (3, 3).\n13. Turn right to face right.\n14. Move forward to (4, 3).\n15. Turn right to face down.\n16. Move forward to (4, 4).\n17. Turn left to face right.\n18. Now facing the door at (5, 4).\n19. Toggle to open the door.\n\nThis is quite lengthy, but given the grid constraints, it seems necessary.\n\n### Optimal path:\nGiven the grid, the agent cannot move directly to the key without some maneuvering. The first step is to move down to (4, 4), then left to (2, 4) to pick up the key, then return to (4, 4), and then toggle the door at (5, 4).\n\n### First action:\nThe agent is at (4, 3), facing right.

The state=2 indicates that the door is locked, so we need a key to open it. \n\n### Key Location:\nThere is a key at position (2, 4) (object_type=5, color=-1, state=0). The agent is currently at (4, 3), facing down (↓). \n\n### Steps to Complete the Mission:\n1. **Pick up the key**: The agent needs to move to (2, 4) to pick up the key. \n   - From (4, 3), facing down, the agent can:\n     - Turn left to face right (→), then move forward to (5, 3).\n     - Turn left again to face up (↑), then move forward to (5, 2).\n     - Turn left again to face left (←), then move forward to (4, 2), (3, 2), and finally (2, 2).\n     - Turn left to face down (↓), then move forward to (2, 3), and (2, 4).\n   - Alternatively, a more efficient path:\n     - Turn right to face left (←), then move forward to (3, 3), (2, 3).\n     - Turn right to face down (↓), then move forward to (2, 4).\n   - Once at (2, 4), use the `pickup` action to collect the key.\n\n2. **Open the door**: After picking up the key, the agent needs to move to the door at (5, 4) and use the `toggle` action to open it.\n   - From (2, 4), facing down, the agent can:\n     - Turn right to face left (←), then move forward to (1, 4), but this is a wall (object_type=1, state=2), so this path is blocked.\n     - Turn left to face right (→), then move forward to (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4).\n   - At (5, 4), use the `toggle` action to open the door.\n\n### Current Situation:\nThe agent is at (4, 3), facing down (↓). The immediate next step is to move toward the key at (2, 4). The most efficient path is:\n1. Turn right to face left (←).\n2. Move forward to (3, 3).\n3. Move forward to (2, 3).\n4.

To reach the door, the agent needs to:\n   - Move forward to (3, 3) (since it's facing left).\n   - Turn right to face down (since the door is below the agent's current position after moving left).\n   - Move forward to (3, 4).\n   - Turn right to face right.\n   - Move forward to (4, 4).\n   - Move forward to (5, 4) (the door's position).\n3. Once at the door, the agent can use the \"toggle\" action to open it.\n\n### Checking for Keys:\n- There is a key at position (2, 4). The color of the key is not specified, but if the door is locked, the agent would need to pick up the key first.\n- However, the mission is to \"open the door\", not necessarily to unlock it. If the door is closed (not locked), the agent can directly toggle it open without a key.\n- Since the observation doesn't specify the door's state, we'll assume it is closed (not locked) and can be opened with \"toggle\".\n\n### Optimal Actions:\n1. Move forward to (3, 3).\n2. Turn right to face down.\n3. Move forward to (3, 4).\n4. Turn right to face right.\n5. Move forward to (4, 4).\n6. Move forward to (5, 4).\n7. Toggle the door.\n\n### Immediate Next Action:\nThe agent is at (4, 3), facing left.

The agent is at (3, 3), facing left (←). \n\n### Steps to open the door:\n1. **Check if the door is locked or closed**: \n   - The state of the door is not explicitly given in the observation, but since the mission is to \"open the door,\" we can assume it is either closed or locked. \n   - If the door is locked, we need a key of the same color as the door. \n   - If the door is closed, we can simply use the `toggle` action to open it.\n\n2. **Locate the key (if needed)**:\n   - There is a key at position (2, 4) (object_type=5). The color of the key is not given, but if the door is locked, we should pick up this key first.\n\n3. **Path to the door**:\n   - The agent is at (3, 3), facing left. To reach the door at (5, 4), the agent needs to:\n     - Turn right to face down (since left is blocked by walls or out of bounds).\n     - Move forward to (3, 4).\n     - Turn right to face right.\n     - Move forward to (4, 4).\n     - Move forward to (5, 4).\n   - Alternatively, if the door is locked, the agent should first go to (2, 4) to pick up the key, then proceed to the door.\n\n4. **Current observation**:\n   - The agent is not carrying anything, so if the door is locked, it cannot be opened yet.\n   - The key at (2, 4) is reachable by:\n     - Turning right to face down.\n     - Moving forward to (3, 4).\n     - Turning left to face right.\n     - Moving forward to (4, 4).\n     - Turning left to face up.\n     - Moving forward to (4, 3) (but this seems unnecessary; perhaps better to go directly to (2, 4)).\n\n### Optimal action:\nSince the door is likely locked (mission is to \"open the door\"), the first step is to pick up the key at (2, 4).

Move forward to (5, 4) (but this is the door; perhaps the key is at (2, 4)).\n\nWait, the key is at (2, 4), so from (3, 3), facing left:\n- Turn right to face down.\n- Move forward to (3, 4).\n- Turn left to face right.\n- Move forward to (4, 4).\n- Turn left to face up.\n- Move forward to (4, 3).\nThis seems convoluted. Alternatively, from (3, 3), facing left:\n- Turn left to face down (no, facing left, turn left is up).\nWait, facing left (direction=2), turn_left is counter-clockwise, so direction becomes up (3).\nThen move forward to (3, 2).\nThis seems not helpful. \n\nPerhaps the simplest first step is to turn right to face down, then move forward to (3, 4), closer to the key at (2, 4).\n\n### First action:\nThe agent is facing left (←) at (3, 3).

The agent is at (3, 3), facing left (←), and is not carrying anything. \n\n### Steps to achieve the mission:\n1. The agent needs to reach the door at (5, 4) to open it. Currently, the agent is facing left, so it cannot move forward immediately toward the door.\n2. The agent should first turn to face the direction that allows it to move toward the door. The door is to the right and slightly up from the agent's current position.\n3. The agent can move right (east) to approach the door. However, the agent is currently facing left, so it needs to turn right twice to face right (or turn left twice, but turning right is more straightforward here).\n4. After turning right twice, the agent will face right and can move forward to (4, 3).\n5. From (4, 3), the agent can turn right to face down (since the door is at (5, 4), which is down and to the right from (4, 3)).\n6. Then, the agent can move forward to (4, 4).\n7. From (4, 4), the agent can turn left to face right again and move forward to (5, 4), reaching the door.\n8. Finally, the agent can use the \"toggle\" action to open the door.\n\n### Immediate next action:\nThe agent is currently at (3, 3), facing left. To start moving toward the door, the first action should be to turn right to face down (since the door is at (5, 4), which is down and to the right from the agent's current position). However, the agent is facing left, so turning right once will face it down.\n\n### Answer:\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Analysis:\nThe mission is to \"open the door.\" From the grid observation, the only door is located at position (5, 4) (object_type=4, color=4, state=2). The state=2 indicates the door is locked, so we need a matching key to open it. \n\n### Key Location:\nThere is a key at position (2, 4) (object_type=5, color=4). The color of the key (4=YELLOW) matches the color of the door (4=YELLOW), so this is the correct key to unlock the door.\n\n### Agent's Position and Orientation:\nThe agent is at (3, 3), facing up (↑). The key is at (2, 4), which is to the left and slightly up from the agent's current position. The door is at (5, 4), which is to the right and slightly up from the agent's current position.\n\n### Steps to Complete the Mission:\n1. **Pick up the key**: \n   - The agent needs to reach (2, 4) to pick up the key. \n   - From (3, 3), the agent can move left to (2, 3), then up to (2, 4). \n   - Currently, the agent is facing up, so it can move forward to (3, 2), but this is not helpful. Instead, the agent should turn left to face left (←), then move forward to (2, 3), then turn right to face up (↑), then move forward to (2, 4), and pick up the key.\n\n2. **Unlock the door**:\n   - After picking up the key, the agent needs to go to the door at (5, 4). \n   - From (2, 4), the agent can move right to (3, 4), then right to (4, 4), then right to (5, 4). \n   - The agent will need to turn right to face right (→), then move forward three times to reach (5, 4). \n   - Once facing the door, the agent can use the \"toggle\" action to unlock and open it.\n\n### Immediate Next Action:\nThe agent is at (3, 3), facing up (↑). To start moving toward the key at (2, 4), the agent should turn left to face left (←), then move forward to (2, 3).\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: turn_left","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission: Open the Door\n1. **Identify the Door**: \n   - The door is located at position (5, 4) (object_type=4, color=4 (YELLOW), state=2 (locked)).\n   - Since the door is locked, we need a key of the same color (YELLOW) to open it.\n\n2. **Find the Key**:\n   - The key is located at position (2, 4) (object_type=5, color=4 (YELLOW)).\n   - The agent is currently at (3, 3), facing left (←).\n\n3. **Path to the Key**:\n   - From (3, 3), the agent needs to move to (2, 3), then (2, 4) to pick up the key.\n   - The agent is facing left, so moving forward will take it to (2, 3).\n\n4. **Actions**:\n   - First, move forward to (2, 3).\n   - Then, turn right to face down (since the key is at (2, 4), which is below (2, 3)).\n   - Move forward to (2, 4) and pick up the key.\n   - Turn left to face left again (toward the door).\n   - Move forward to (3, 4), then (4, 4), then (5, 4).\n   - Use the toggle action to open the door.\n\n### Immediate Next Action:\nThe agent is at (3, 3), facing left. The first step is to move forward to (2, 3).\n\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission: Open the door\n1. **Agent Position and Orientation**: The agent is at (2, 3), facing left (←). \n2. **Observation**: \n   - Directly to the left of the agent (position (1, 3)) is empty (object_type = -1, which likely means it's a walkable floor or similar).\n   - Below the agent (position (2, 4)) is a KEY (object_type = 5). \n   - Further to the left, at position (5, 4), there is a DOOR (object_type = 4). The door's state is not explicitly given in the observation, but since the mission is to \"open the door,\" we can assume it is either closed or locked.\n   - The agent is not carrying anything.\n\n### Steps to Open the Door:\n1. **Pick Up the Key**: The agent needs to pick up the key below it (at (2, 4)) to potentially unlock the door. \n   - To do this, the agent must turn to face the key (downward), then move forward to the key's position, and then pick it up.\n   - However, since the agent is facing left, it can first turn right to face downward (since turning right from left faces the agent downward), then move forward to (2, 4), and then pick up the key.\n\n2. **Navigate to the Door**: After picking up the key, the agent needs to navigate to the door at (5, 4). \n   - From (2, 4), the agent can turn left to face right, then move forward to (3, 4), (4, 4), and finally (5, 4).\n   - At (5, 4), the agent can use the \"toggle\" action to open the door (assuming the key matches the door's color or the door is closed but not locked).\n\n### Immediate Next Action:\nThe first step is to pick up the key. To do this:\n1. The agent is facing left. To face downward (toward the key at (2, 4)), it should turn right (from left, turning right faces downward).\n2. Then, it can move forward to (2, 4) and pick up the key.\n\nThus, the immediate next action is to turn right to face the key.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this problem, let's analyze the given grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Analysis:\nThe mission is to \"open the door.\" From the grid observation, the only door is located at (5, 4) (object_type=4, color=?, state=?).

The cell directly in front of the agent (at (2, 2)) is empty (object_type=-1, which seems to be a placeholder for empty or invalid; assuming it's traversable).\n2. Below the agent (at (2, 4)) is a key (object_type=5). Since the mission is to open the door, and doors may require keys, it might be useful to pick up the key first. However, the door's state is not explicitly given, so we don't know if it's locked or just closed. For safety, we should pick up the key.\n3. After picking up the key, the agent can move toward the door at (5, 4). \n\n### Steps:\n1. The agent is facing up, so to move toward the key at (2, 4), it needs to turn around (turn_left twice or turn_right twice) to face down. Let's choose `turn_right` twice for simplicity (though one turn_right would suffice to face down).\n2. Then, move forward to (2, 4) and `pickup` the key.\n3. After picking up the key, navigate to the door at (5, 4). This requires moving right (east) to column 5 and then up\/down to row 4. Since the agent is at (2, 4) after picking up the key, it can move right to (3, 4), (4, 4), and then (5, 4).\n4. At the door, if it's closed or locked, use `toggle` to open it.\n\n### Immediate Next Action:\nThe agent is at (2, 3), facing up. The key is at (2, 4), directly below the agent. To face the key, the agent should turn to face down. The quickest way is to `turn_right` (which would face the agent right, then another `turn_right` to face down). However, a single `turn_right` would face the agent right, and then `move_forward` would take it to (3, 3), which is not helpful. Instead, the correct immediate action is to `turn_left` to face left, then `turn_left` again to face down. But the simplest is to `turn_right` twice to face down.\n\nHowever, since we can only output one action at a time, the first action is `turn_right`.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Analysis:\nThe mission is to \"open the door.\" From the grid observation, the only door is located at (5, 4) (object_type=4, color=?, state=?).

Use the \"toggle\" action to open the door.\n\n### Checking Door State:\nIf the door is locked (state=2), the agent would need to pick up the key at (2, 4) first. However, the mission does not mention unlocking, so we can proceed with the assumption that the door is closed (state=1) and can be opened with \"toggle.\"\n\n### Optimal Path:\nGiven the above, the optimal sequence is:\n1. `turn_right` (to face right →)\n2. `move_forward` (to (5, 3))\n3. `turn_right` (to face down ↓)\n4. `move_forward` (to (5, 4))\n5. `toggle` (to open the door)\n\n### Immediate Next Action:\nThe first action is to `turn_right` to face the direction we need to move toward the door.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Analysis:\nThe mission is to \"open the door.\" From the grid observation, the only door is located at position (5, 4). The door's state is not explicitly given in the observation, but since the mission is to open it, we can assume it is either closed or locked. \n\n### Agent's Current State:\n- Position: (4, 3)\n- Facing: right (→)\n- Not carrying anything.\n\n### Path to the Door:\n1. The door is at (5, 4), which is one cell to the right (x+1) and one cell up (y-1) from the agent's current position (4, 3).\n2. The agent is facing right, so it can move forward to (5, 3) first.\n3. From (5, 3), the agent needs to turn left (to face up) and then move forward to (5, 4) to reach the door.\n\n### Steps to Complete the Mission:\n1. Move forward to (5, 3).\n2. Turn left to face up.\n3. Move forward to (5, 4) to face the door.\n4. Use the \"toggle\" action to open the door.\n\n### Immediate Next Action:\nThe agent is at (4, 3), facing right, and the cell to the right (5, 3) is empty (object_type 1, which is EMPTY). Therefore, the agent can move forward to (5, 3).\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: move_forward","Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. Current Position & Orientation:\n   - Agent is at (4,3) facing right (→)\n   - Not carrying anything\n\n2. Mission Objective:\n   - \"open the door\" - we need to find and open a door\n\n3. Door Location:\n   - There's a door at (5,4) - this is directly to the right of the agent's current position\n   - The door's state isn't visible in the observation, but we can assume it's either closed or locked\n\n4. Path to Door:\n   - From (4,3) to (5,4):\n     - First need to move forward to (5,3)\n     - Then turn right to face up (towards y=4)\n     - Then move forward to (5,4) to face the door\n\n5. Possible Actions:\n   - Since we're not carrying anything and there's no key visible in our immediate path, we should first approach the door\n   - The immediate action is to move forward towards (5,3)\n\n6. Next Steps After Moving:\n   - After moving to (5,3), we'll need to turn right to face the door at (5,4)\n   - Then we can attempt to toggle\/open the door\n\nThe first action needed is to move forward towards the door's location.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission: Open the door\n1. **Agent Position and Orientation**: The agent is at (4, 3) and facing right (→). This means the agent is looking towards increasing x-coordinates (east direction).\n2. **Door Location**: The door is located at (5, 4) (object_type=4, color=4 (YELLOW), state=2 (locked)). The agent is currently one cell away from the door (to the left of it).\n3. **Key Location**: There is a key at (2, 4) (object_type=5, color=5 (GREY)). The agent needs to pick up this key to unlock the door.\n4. **Path to the Key**: \n   - From (4, 3), the agent needs to move left to (3, 3), then up to (3, 4), then left to (2, 4) to reach the key.\n   - Alternatively, the agent could move up to (4, 4), then left to (3, 4), then left to (2, 4). However, this path is the same length (3 moves) as the first one.\n5. **Unlocking the Door**:\n   - After picking up the key, the agent needs to return to the door. The shortest path is right to (3, 4), right to (4, 4), then right to (5, 4).\n   - At the door, the agent must use the `toggle` action to unlock and open it (since the door is locked and the agent now has the key).\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n1. Move left to (3, 3).\n2. Move up to (3, 4).\n3. Move left to (2, 4) and pick up the key (`pickup`).\n4. Move right to (3, 4).\n5. Move right to (4, 4).\n6. Move right to (5, 4) and `toggle` the door.\n\n### Immediate Next Action:\nThe agent is at (4, 3), facing right. To start moving towards the key, the agent needs to turn left to face up (since the key is above and to the left). However, the first move is actually left to (3, 3), so the agent should turn left to face left, then move forward.\n\nBut wait: the agent is at (4, 3), facing right. The key is at (2, 4), which is up and to the left. The most efficient first move is to turn left (to face up), then move forward to (4, 4), then turn left (to face left), then move forward to (3, 4), then move forward to (2, 4), and pick up the key.\n\nHowever, the immediate next action is to turn left to face up, then move forward to (4, 4).\n\nBut looking at the grid, (4, 4) is empty (object_type=-1, which seems to be a placeholder for empty\/floor), so the agent can move there.\n\n### Final Decision:\nThe agent is facing right and needs to start moving towards the key. The first step is to turn left to face up (towards (4, 4)).\n\nAnswer: turn_left","To solve this problem, let's analyze the given grid and mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Analysis:\nThe mission is to \"open the door.\" From the grid observation, the only door is located at position (5, 4). The door is represented by `[4, color, state]`. We need to check its state to determine how to open it.\n\n### Grid Observation:\n- The agent is at position (4, 3), facing up (direction = 3).\n- The door is at (5, 4). The agent is currently one cell below (4, 3) and one cell to the left (5, 4) of the door. To interact with the door, the agent must be facing it and adjacent to it.\n- The door's state is not explicitly given in the observation, but since the mission is to open it, we can assume it is either closed or locked. If it were already open, the mission would be complete.\n- There is a key at position (2, 4), represented by `[5, color, 0]`. If the door is locked, the agent will need to pick up this key first.\n\n### Steps to Open the Door:\n1. **Check Door State**: The door is at (5, 4). The agent is at (4, 3), so it needs to move to (5, 3) to be adjacent to the door and face it.\n2. **Move to (5, 3)**:\n   - Currently, the agent is at (4, 3), facing up. To move to (5, 3), the agent needs to:\n     - Turn right (to face right, direction = 0).\n     - Move forward to (5, 3).\n3. **Face the Door**: From (5, 3), the agent should face up (direction = 3) to be adjacent to the door at (5, 4).\n4. **Interact with the Door**:\n   - If the door is closed, use `toggle` to open it.\n   - If the door is locked, the agent must first pick up the key at (2, 4), then return to (5, 3), face the door, and use `toggle`.\n\n### Current Observation:\nThe agent is at (4, 3), facing up. The immediate next step is to turn right to face right (direction = 0), then move forward to (5, 3).\n\n### Action Sequence:\n1. `turn_right` (to face right).\n2. `move_forward` (to move to (5, 3)).\n3. `turn_left` (to face up toward the door).\n4. `toggle` (to open the door).\n\nSince the agent is currently at (4, 3) facing up, the first action is `turn_right`.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission: Open the Door\n1. **Agent Position and Orientation**: The agent is at (4, 3), facing right (→).\n2. **Door Location**: The door is at (5, 4). It is directly to the right of the agent's current position.\n3. **Door State**: The door's state is not explicitly given in the observation, but since the mission is to \"open the door,\" we can assume it is either closed or locked. \n4. **Key Availability**: There is a key at (2, 4). The color of the key and the door are not specified, but since the mission doesn't mention a color, we can assume the key matches the door or the door is not locked (just closed).\n\n### Steps to Open the Door:\n1. The agent is already facing the door (right). The door is one cell to the right at (5, 4).\n2. The agent can move forward to (5, 3), then turn right to face down (towards the door at (5, 4)), and then use the \"toggle\" action to open the door.\n   - However, moving to (5, 3) is not possible because (5, 3) is a wall (object_type=2). \n   - The correct approach is to move forward to (5, 3), but since that's a wall, we need an alternative path.\n3. Alternative Path:\n   - The agent can move forward to (5, 3), but since that's a wall, the agent must first turn right to face down, then move forward to (4, 4), then turn left to face right, then move forward to (5, 4), and then \"toggle\" the door.\n   - However, (4, 4) is empty (object_type=-1), so the agent can move there.\n\n### Optimal Path:\n1. Turn right (now facing down).\n2. Move forward to (4, 4).\n3. Turn left (now facing right).\n4. Move forward to (5, 4).\n5. Toggle the door.\n\n### Final Action:\nThe first action is to turn right to face down.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission: Open the Door\n1. **Agent Position and Orientation**: The agent is at (4, 3), facing down (↓). This means the cell directly below the agent is (4, 4).\n2. **Door Location**: The door is located at (5, 4), which is to the right of the agent's current position (since the agent is at (4, 3) and facing down, the right cell is (5, 3)). However, the door is not directly in front of the agent's current orientation.\n3. **Key Location**: There is a key at (2, 4). The agent needs to pick up this key to unlock the door if it is locked.\n4. **Door State**: The door at (5, 4) has object_type=4 (DOOR), but its state is not explicitly given in the observation. However, since the mission is to \"open the door,\" we can assume it is either closed or locked.\n\n### Steps to Open the Door:\n1. **Turn Right**: The agent is facing down (↓). To face the door (which is to the right), the agent needs to turn right to face right (→).\n2. **Move Forward**: After turning right, the agent will be at (4, 3) facing right (→). The cell to the right is (5, 3), which is empty (object_type=-1), so the agent can move forward to (5, 3).\n3. **Turn Left**: Now, the agent is at (5, 3) facing right (→). To face the door at (5, 4), the agent needs to turn left to face down (↓).\n4. **Toggle**: The agent is now facing the door at (5, 4) and can toggle it to open it.\n\nHowever, since the door might be locked, the agent should first pick up the key at (2, 4):\n1. **Turn Left**: From the initial position (4, 3) facing down (↓), turn left to face right (→).\n2. **Move Forward**: Move to (5, 3).\n3. **Turn Left**: Turn left to face down (↓).\n4. **Move Forward**: Move to (5, 4) (but this is the door, so this might not be possible if the door is closed or locked).\n   \nAlternatively, a better path is:\n1. **Turn Left**: From (4, 3) facing down (↓), turn left to face right (→).\n2. **Move Forward**: Move to (5, 3).\n3. **Turn Right**: Turn right to face down (↓).\n4. **Move Forward**: Move to (5, 4) (door).\n\nBut since the door might be locked, the agent should first go to the key at (2, 4):\n1. **Turn Right**: From (4, 3) facing down (↓), turn right to face left (←).\n2. **Move Forward**: Move to (3, 3).\n3. **Move Forward**: Move to (2, 3).\n4. **Turn Right**: Turn right to face down (↓).\n5. **Move Forward**: Move to (2, 4) and pick up the key.\n6. **Turn Left**: Turn left to face right (→).\n7. **Move Forward**: Move to (3, 4).\n8. **Move Forward**: Move to (4, 4).\n9. **Move Forward**: Move to (5, 4) and toggle the door.\n\nGiven the complexity, the first step is to turn right to face the door's direction.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Analysis:\nThe mission is to \"open the door\". From the observation, we can see that there is a door at position (5, 4) (object_type=4, color=?, state=?). The agent is currently at (4, 3), facing left (←). \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. The agent is not carrying anything, so if the door is locked, we may need to pick up a key first.\n2. There is a key at position (2, 4) (object_type=5). The color of the key is not specified in the observation, but we can assume it matches the door's color if the door is locked.\n3. The door at (5, 4) is in the same row as the agent (row 3), but the agent is facing left, away from the door. The door is to the right of the agent.\n\n### Steps to Complete the Mission:\n1. Turn the agent to face right (towards the door). Currently facing left, so we need to turn right twice (or turn left twice) to face right.\n2. Move forward to (5, 3), which is adjacent to the door at (5, 4).\n3. Check if the door is locked. If it is locked, we need to:\n   - Turn left to face upwards (towards the key at (2, 4)).\n   - Move forward to (5, 4).\n   - Turn left to face left.\n   - Move forward to (4, 4).\n   - Turn left to face down.\n   - Move forward to (4, 5) (but this seems incorrect; need to adjust path to reach (2, 4)).\n   Alternatively, a better path to the key:\n   - From (5, 3), turn right to face down.\n   - Move forward to (5, 4).\n   - Turn left to face right.\n   - Move forward to (6, 4).\n   - Turn left to face up.\n   - Move forward to (6, 3).\n   - Turn left to face left.\n   - Move forward to (5, 3).\n   - Turn left to face down.\n   - Move forward to (5, 4).\n   - Turn right to face left.\n   - Move forward to (4, 4).\n   - Turn left to face up.\n   - Move forward to (4, 3).\n   - Turn left to face right.\n   - Move forward to (5, 3).\n   - Turn right to face down.\n   - Move forward to (5, 4).\n   - Pick up the key.\n   - Then return to the door and toggle it.\n\nHowever, this seems overly complicated. Given the grid, the key is at (2, 4), and the agent is at (4, 3). The simplest path is:\n1. Turn right to face down.\n2. Move forward to (4, 4).\n3. Turn left to face right.\n4. Move forward to (5, 4).\n5. Pick up the key (if it's there).\n6. Turn left to face up.\n7. Move forward to (5, 3).\n8. Turn left to face left.\n9. Move forward to (4, 3).\n10. Turn left to face down.\n11. Move forward to (4, 4).\n12. Turn right to face left.\n13. Move forward to (3, 4).\n14. Turn left to face down.\n15. Move forward to (3, 5).\n16. Turn right to face left.\n17. Move forward to (2, 5).\n18. Turn left to face up.\n19. Move forward to (2, 4).\n20. Pick up the key.\n21. Then return to the door and toggle it.\n\nThis is still very long. Given the complexity, perhaps the door is not locked, and we can simply toggle it. Let's assume the door is closed but not locked, so we can:\n1. Turn right to face down.\n2. Move forward to (4, 4).\n3. Turn left to face right.\n4. Move forward to (5, 4).\n5. Toggle the door.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe first step is to turn the agent to face towards the door. Currently facing left, we need to face right, so turn right twice (or turn left twice). Since turn_right is an action, we'll do turn_right.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission: Open the door\n1. **Agent Position and Orientation**: The agent is at (4, 3), facing up (↑). This means the cell directly in front of the agent is (4, 2).\n2. **Door Location**: The door is at (5, 4). The agent is not currently facing the door, so we need to navigate to a position where the agent can face the door to interact with it.\n3. **Key Location**: There is a key at (2, 4). Since the mission is to open the door (not explicitly to unlock it), we don't yet know if the door is locked. However, if the door is locked, we will need the key. The key is at (2, 4), which is to the left of the agent's current position.\n4. **Path to the Door**:\n   - From (4, 3), the agent can move up to (4, 2), then turn right to face right (→), then move forward to (5, 2), then turn right again to face down (↓), then move forward to (5, 3), and finally move forward to (5, 4) to face the door.\n   - Alternatively, the agent can turn left to face left (←), move forward to (3, 3), then move forward to (2, 3), then turn right to face up (↑), then move forward to (2, 4) to pick up the key (if needed), then navigate to the door.\n\nGiven the mission is to open the door, and the door is at (5, 4), the most straightforward path is to navigate to (5, 4) and face the door to toggle it. Since the agent is not carrying anything and the door's state is not specified as locked, we can assume it is either closed or open. If it's closed, we can toggle it; if it's locked, we'd need the key.\n\n### Immediate Next Action:\nThe agent is currently at (4, 3), facing up (↑). The cell in front is (4, 2), which is empty (object_type -1, which seems to represent FLOOR or walkable space based on the grid). The agent can move forward to (4, 2).\n\n### Answer:\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Analysis:\nThe mission is to \"open the door\".

However, there is a key at (2, 4), but it is not along the direct path to the door, and the mission does not mention unlocking, just opening.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nThe agent is currently facing up (↑) and cannot move forward (since (4, 1) is a wall). The best immediate action is to turn right to face right (→), which will allow the agent to move towards the door in subsequent steps.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: turn_right","Let's analyze the situation:\n\n1.

To reach it, the agent needs to move right to (5, 2), then down to (5, 3), and then down to (5, 4). \n3. **Key Check**: The door might be locked (state=2), so we need to check if there's a key nearby. There is a key at (2, 4) (object_type=5). To pick it up, the agent would need to go left to (2, 2), then up to (2, 3), then up to (2, 4).

To reach (2, 4), the agent needs to:\n     - Turn right to face down (since the agent is facing left, turning right will make it face down).\n     - Move forward to (4, 3).\n     - Turn left to face right.\n     - Move forward to (5, 3).\n     - Turn left to face up.\n     - Move forward to (5, 4) (but this is the door, so the agent should stop at (5, 3)).\n     - Instead, after reaching (5, 3), turn right to face down.\n     - Move forward to (5, 4) (door), but the key is at (2, 4), so this path is incorrect.\n   - Alternatively, the agent can:\n     - Turn right to face down.\n     - Move forward to (4, 3).\n     - Turn right to face left.\n     - Move forward to (3, 3).\n     - Move forward to (2, 3).\n     - Turn left to face down.\n     - Move forward to (2, 4) to pick up the key.\n2. **Open the door**: After picking up the key, the agent needs to go to the door at (5, 4) and use the \"toggle\" action to open it.\n   - From (2, 4), the agent can:\n     - Turn right to face left.\n     - Move forward to (1, 4).\n     - Turn right to face down.\n     - Move forward to (1, 5) (but this is a wall, so invalid).\n     - Alternatively, from (2, 4), turn left to face up.\n     - Move forward to (2, 3).\n     - Turn right to face right.\n     - Move forward to (3, 3).\n     - Move forward to (4, 3).\n     - Turn right to face down.\n     - Move forward to (4, 4).\n     - Turn left to face right.\n     - Move forward to (5, 4) (door).\n     - Use \"toggle\" to open the door.\n\n### Current Situation:\nThe agent is at (4, 2), facing left.

The door is at (5, 4), which is to the right and down relative to the agent's current position.\n2. **Path to the Door**: \n   - First, the agent needs to turn right to face right (→) because the door is to the right of the agent's current column (column 5 vs. column 4).\n   - Then, the agent should move forward to (5, 2).\n   - Next, the agent needs to turn right again to face down (↓) because the door is below the agent's current row (row 4 vs. row 2).\n   - Then, the agent should move forward twice to reach (5, 4), the door's position.\n   - Finally, the agent should use the `toggle` action to open the door (since the door is directly in front of it after moving down).\n\n### Actions:\n1. `turn_right` (to face right →)\n2. `move_forward` (to (5, 2))\n3. `turn_right` (to face down ↓)\n4. `move_forward` (to (5, 3))\n5. `move_forward` (to (5, 4))\n6. `toggle` (to open the door)\n\n### First Action:\nThe first action is to turn right to face the direction of the door. \n\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission: Open the door\nFrom the observation, the agent is at position (4, 2), facing right (→).

The door is locked (state=2), so we need a key of the same color (YELLOW) to unlock it.\n2. Looking at the grid, there is a key at position (2, 4) (object_type=5, color=4 (YELLOW)). This matches the door's color.\n3. The agent is not carrying anything, so it needs to:\n   - Move to the key at (2, 4).\n   - Pick up the key.\n   - Move to the door at (5, 4).\n   - Use the `toggle` action to unlock and open the door.\n\n### Path to the key:\n- The agent is at (4, 2), facing right.\n- To reach (2, 4), the agent needs to:\n  - Turn left (to face up).\n  - Move forward twice to reach (4, 0) (but this is a wall, so invalid).\n  - Alternatively, turn right (to face down), move forward to (4, 3), then turn left (to face right), move forward to (5, 3), turn left (to face up), move forward to (5, 4) (but this is the door, not the key).\n  - The correct path is:\n    - Turn left (to face up).\n    - Move forward to (4, 1) (but this is a wall, so invalid).\n    - Turn right (to face down).\n    - Move forward to (4, 3).\n    - Turn left (to face right).\n    - Move forward to (5, 3).\n    - Turn left (to face up).\n    - Move forward to (5, 4) (door, but we need the key first).\n    - This seems incorrect.

The door at (5, 4) is grey (color=5), so the key does not match the door's color. \n\n### Possible Actions:\nSince there is no matching key available, the only way to interact with the door is to try to toggle it directly. However, locked doors cannot be opened without the correct key. Given the current grid, it seems impossible to complete the mission as there is no matching key available.\n\nBut let's verify the door's state again: the door at (5, 4) has state=2 (locked), and color=5 (grey). The key at (2, 4) is color=2 (blue), so it doesn't match. \n\n### Conclusion:\nSince there is no matching key available to unlock the door, the mission cannot be completed.

If it's locked, we'll need the key.\n2. **If the door is locked**:\n   - Move left to (3, 4) (one step left from (4, 4)).\n   - Move left again to (2, 4) to pick up the key.\n   - Pick up the key with `pickup`.\n   - Move right back to (4, 4).\n   - Face the door and `toggle` it.\n\n### Current Situation:\n- The agent is at (4, 4), facing right, and the door is at (5, 4). The simplest first action is to try to `toggle` the door directly, as it might be closed (not locked). If that fails, we can proceed to pick up the key.\n\n### Action:\nSince the door is adjacent and the agent is facing it, the first action should be to attempt to `toggle` it.\n\nAnswer: toggle","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Analysis:\nThe mission is to \"open the door.\" From the grid observation, we can see:\n1. **Agent Position**: The agent is at (4, 4), facing right (→).\n2. **Door Position**: There is a door at (5, 4) (object_type=4, state not explicitly given but likely closed or locked since the mission is to open it).\n3. **Key Position**: There is a key at (2, 4) (object_type=5). Since the agent is not carrying anything, we may need to pick up the key first if the door is locked.\n\n### Steps to Complete the Mission:\n1. **Check Door State**: The door at (5, 4) is directly to the right of the agent. Since the agent is facing right, it can interact with the door immediately. However, we don't know if the door is locked or just closed. \n   - If the door is closed (state=1), the agent can use `toggle` to open it.\n   - If the door is locked (state=2), the agent must first pick up the key at (2, 4) to unlock it.\n2. **Key Pickup**: The key is at (2, 4), which is two cells to the left of the agent. The agent must:\n   - Turn left (to face left, towards the key).\n   - Move forward twice to reach (2, 4).\n   - Pick up the key.\n   - Turn right (to face right, back towards the door).\n   - Move forward twice to return to (4, 4).\n   - Use `toggle` to open the door.\n\nHowever, since the mission is simply to \"open the door,\" and the agent is already facing the door, the most efficient first action is to try to `toggle` the door. If the door is closed (not locked), this will succeed. If it's locked, the agent will need to backtrack and pick up the key.\n\n### Optimal Action:\nGiven that the agent is already facing the door, the first action should be to attempt to `toggle` the door. If this fails (because the door is locked), the next steps would involve picking up the key.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: toggle","To solve this problem, let's analyze the given grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Analysis:\nThe mission is to \"open the door\".

Check if the door is locked or just closed:\n   - If the door is locked (state=2), we need to pick up the key first.\n   - If the door is closed (state=1), we can directly toggle it open.\n   - The observation does not explicitly give the door's state, but since the mission is to \"open the door,\" we should assume it is either closed or locked.

Path to the Key:\n   - The key is at (2, 4), which is two cells to the left of the agent (4, 4).\n   - The agent is facing right, so it needs to turn left twice (to face left) or turn right twice (to face left). Turning left once would face the agent upwards, which is not helpful.\n   - After turning left twice (or right twice), the agent can move forward twice to reach the key.\n   - Then, the agent can pick up the key.\n\n3.

The color of the key is not specified in the observation, but since the door's color is also not specified, we can assume the key matches the door (if the door is locked).\n\n### Steps to Complete the Mission:\n1. The agent is already facing the door (right direction), so no turning is needed initially.\n2. If the door is closed (state=1), the agent can directly use the \"toggle\" action to open it.\n3. If the door is locked (state=2), the agent must first pick up the key at (2, 4), then return to the door and use \"toggle\" to open it.\n\n### Observation Details:\n- The agent is at (4, 4), facing right.\n- The door is at (5, 4).\n- The key is at (2, 4).\n\n### Path to Key:\nTo reach the key at (2, 4):\n1.

Pick up the key.\n\nHowever, looking at the grid, the cells to the left of the agent (from (4,4) to (3,4) to (2,4)) are all empty (object_type=-1, which seems to represent walkable floor).

To interact with the door at (5, 4), the agent needs to face right (→) because the door is to the right of the agent's current position.\n2. The agent must first turn right to face the door.\n3. Then, the agent can use the \"toggle\" action to open the door.\n\n### Checking the door state:\nThe door's state is not explicitly given in the observation, but since the mission is to \"open the door,\" we can assume it is either closed or locked. If it's locked, the agent would need a key, but there is a key at (2, 4) (object_type=5).

Currently, the agent is at (4, 4), facing left. The key is two cells to the left (at (2, 4)), but there is a wall or obstacle at (3, 4) (object_type=2). So, the agent cannot move directly left to reach the key.\n2. **Navigate around the obstacle**: The agent must turn right to face down (since turning left would face it towards a wall), move forward to (4, 5), then turn left to face right, move forward to (5, 5), turn left to face up, and then move forward to (5, 4) to reach the door. However, this path doesn't help in picking up the key.\n3. **Alternative path**: The agent can turn right to face down, move forward to (4, 5), turn right to face left, move forward to (3, 5), turn right to face up, move forward to (3, 4), and then pick up the key.

Let's re-evaluate:\n- The agent is at (4, 4), facing left. The key is at (2, 4), but (3, 4) is a wall. The agent cannot move left to reach the key directly.\n- The agent must find a path around the wall to reach the key. The simplest path is:\n  1. Turn right (now facing down).\n  2.

The agent is not carrying anything, and there are no keys visible in the immediate vicinity (the key at (2, 4) is not directly accessible without moving).\n4. The door at (5, 4) is likely closed or locked (since the mission is to open it).\n\n### Steps to Open the Door:\n1. The agent is currently facing left, so the door is to its right. To interact with the door, the agent needs to face it.\n2. The agent should turn right to face the door (facing right →).\n3. Then, the agent can use the \"toggle\" action to open the door.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n1. `turn_right` - To face the door (from left to right).\n2. `toggle` - To open the door.\n\nSince the agent is not carrying anything and there are no keys nearby, we assume the door is closed but not locked (or the key is not required for this mission). \n\n### Final Answer:\nThe first action is to turn right to face the door.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Let me analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. Current Position: Agent is at (4,4) facing up (↑)\n2. Mission: \"open the door\" - I need to find and open a door\n3. Looking at the grid, there's a door at (5,4) (object_type=4) which is directly to the right of the agent\n4. The agent is currently facing up, so I need to turn right to face the door\n5. The door appears to be closed (state=2) but not locked (since state=2 is for locked doors, but the observation shows state=4 which might be a typo - assuming it's closed)\n6. No keys are needed as the mission is just to open the door, not unlock it\n7. The key at (2,4) is not relevant for this mission\n\nOptimal sequence:\n1. Turn right to face the door (currently facing up, need to face right)\n2. Toggle the door to open it\n\nFirst action should be to turn right to face the door.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission: Open the Door\n1. **Agent Position and Orientation**: The agent is at (4, 4), facing right (→). \n2. **Door Location**: The door is at (5, 4), which is directly to the right of the agent. The door's state is not explicitly given in the observation, but since the mission is to \"open the door,\" we can assume it is either closed or locked.\n3. **Key Availability**: There is a key at (2, 4), which is two cells to the left of the agent. The color of the key is not specified, but since the door's color is also not given, we can assume the key matches the door (if the door is locked).\n4. **Steps**: The agent is not carrying anything, so if the door is locked, it must first pick up the key.\n\n### Steps to Complete the Mission:\n1. **Move Left Twice**: From (4, 4), move left to (3, 4), then to (2, 4) to reach the key.\n2. **Pick Up the Key**: At (2, 4), use the `pickup` action to collect the key.\n3. **Move Right Twice**: Move back to (4, 4) by going right to (3, 4), then to (4, 4).\n4. **Open the Door**: At (4, 4), facing right, the door is directly to the right at (5, 4). Use the `toggle` action to open the door.\n\n### Current Action:\nThe first step is to move left to (3, 4). Since the agent is facing right, it must first turn left to face up (but this seems incorrect based on the grid layout). Wait, the grid's orientation might be different. Let me re-examine:\n\n- The agent is at (4, 4), facing right (→). The key is at (2, 4), which is left of the agent. To move left, the agent must face left, so it needs to turn left twice (from right to down to left) or turn right twice (from right to up to left). Alternatively, it can turn left once to face up, but that doesn't help. \n\nWait, the agent's direction is encoded as 0=right, 1=down, 2=left, 3=up. The agent is facing right (0), so to face left (2), it needs to turn left twice or turn right twice. The shortest is to turn left twice.\n\nBut actually, the key is at (2, 4), which is two cells to the left of the agent at (4, 4). So the agent can:\n1. Turn left (now facing up), but that's not toward the key.\n2. Turn right (now facing down), but that's not toward the key.\n3. Turn left twice (now facing left), then move forward twice to reach the key.\n\nSo the first action is `turn_left`.\n\nBut looking at the grid, the agent is at (4, 4), and the key is at (2, 4). The agent is facing right (→), so to move left, it must first turn left to face up (but that's not left). Wait, no: turning left from right (0) makes it face up (3). That's not helpful. Turning right from right (0) makes it face down (1). Also not helpful. \n\nWait, the direction encoding is:\n- 0: right\n- 1: down\n- 2: left\n- 3: up\n\nSo to face left (2), the agent must turn left twice (right -> up -> left) or turn right twice (right -> down -> left). The shortest is to turn left twice.\n\nBut the first turn left will make it face up, which is not toward the key. So the first action is `turn_left`.\n\n### Final Decision:\nThe first action is to turn left to start reorienting toward the key. \n\nAnswer: turn_left","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Analysis:\nThe mission is to \"open the door.\" From the grid observation, the door is located at position (5, 4) (object_type=4, color=-1, state=1 or 2).

This suggests there might be no door directly in front.\n\n2. **Locating the Door**:\n   - Scanning the grid for doors (object_type=4):\n     - At (5, 4), there is a door `[5, 4, 4]` (color=4=YELLOW, state not provided but likely closed or locked since the mission is to open it).\n   - The door is at (5, 4), which is to the right and down from the agent's current position (3, 3).\n\n3. **Path to the Door**:\n   - From (3, 3) to (5, 4):\n     - Move right to (4, 3), then (5, 3).\n     - Then move down to (5, 4).\n   - The agent is currently facing up, so it needs to turn right to face right (towards the door).\n\n4. **Actions**:\n   - First, turn right to face right (current direction: up → turn right → right).\n   - Then, move forward twice to reach (5, 3).\n   - Then, turn right to face down (current direction: right → turn right → down).\n   - Move forward to reach (5, 4) (the door).\n   - Finally, use `toggle` to open the door.\n\n### Steps:\n1. `turn_right` (now facing right)\n2. `move_forward` (to (4, 3))\n3. `move_forward` (to (5, 3))\n4. `turn_right` (now facing down)\n5. `move_forward` (to (5, 4))\n6. `toggle` (open the door)\n\n### Next Action:\nThe first action is to turn right to face the door's direction.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission: Open the door\n1. **Agent Position and Orientation**: The agent is at (3, 3) and facing right (→). \n2. **Door Location**: The door is at (5, 4). It is a purple door (color=3) and its state is not explicitly given, but since the mission is to \"open the door,\" we can assume it is either closed or locked.\n3. **Key Location**: There is a key at (2, 4). The key's color is yellow (color=4). Since the door is purple and the key is yellow, they do not match. This means the key cannot unlock the door, so the door must be closed (not locked).\n4. **Path to the Door**: \n   - From (3, 3), the agent can move right to (4, 3), then right again to (5, 3), and then up to (5, 4) to face the door.\n   - Alternatively, the agent could move up to (3, 2), but this seems less direct.\n5. **Action Sequence**:\n   - The agent is already facing right, so the first action is `move_forward` to (4, 3).\n   - Next, `move_forward` again to (5, 3).\n   - Then, `turn_left` to face up (since the door is at (5, 4)).\n   - Finally, `toggle` to open the door.\n\n### Optimal Actions:\nSince the door is not locked (no matching key), we can directly approach it and toggle it open. The shortest path is:\n1. `move_forward` (to (4, 3))\n2. `move_forward` (to (5, 3))\n3. `turn_left` (to face up)\n4. `toggle` (to open the door)\n\nThe first action is `move_forward`.\n\n### Answer:\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Analysis:\nThe mission is to \"open the door.\" From the grid observation, we can see:\n1. The agent is at position (4, 3), facing right (→).\n2. There is a door at position (5, 4) (object_type=4, color=4 (YELLOW), state=2 (locked)). \n   - Since the door is locked (state=2), we need a matching key to open it. The key must be the same color as the door (YELLOW in this case).\n3. There is a key at position (2, 4) (object_type=5, color=4 (YELLOW), state=0). This key matches the door's color (YELLOW).\n\n### Steps to Complete the Mission:\n1. Pick up the YELLOW key at (2, 4):\n   - The agent is at (4, 3), facing right. To reach (2, 4), the agent needs to:\n     - Turn left (to face up).\n     - Move forward twice to reach (4, 1).\n     - Turn left (to face left).\n     - Move forward twice to reach (2, 1).\n     - Turn right (to face up).\n     - Move forward three times to reach (2, 4).\n     - Pick up the key.\n2. Go to the locked door at (5, 4):\n   - From (2, 4), the agent needs to:\n     - Turn right (to face right).\n     - Move forward three times to reach (5, 4).\n     - Toggle (to unlock and open the door).\n\n### Optimal Path:\nGiven the time constraints (14 steps remaining), we need to minimize steps. Here's the sequence:\n1. Turn left (now facing up).\n2. Move forward (to (4, 2)).\n3. Move forward (to (4, 1)).\n4. Turn left (now facing left).\n5. Move forward (to (3, 1)).\n6. Move forward (to (2, 1)).\n7. Turn right (now facing up).\n8. Move forward (to (2, 2)).\n9. Move forward (to (2, 3)).\n10. Move forward (to (2, 4)).\n11. Pick up (collect the YELLOW key).\n12. Turn right (now facing right).\n13. Move forward (to (3, 4)).\n14. Move forward (to (4, 4)).\n15. Move forward (to (5, 4)).\n16. Toggle (open the door).\n\nHowever, this exceeds the 14-step limit. Let's optimize further:\n- Skip moving to (4, 1) and go directly left from (4, 3):\n  1. Turn left (now facing up).\n  2. Move forward (to (4, 2)).\n  3. Turn left (now facing left).\n  4. Move forward (to (3, 2)).\n  5. Move forward (to (2, 2)).\n  6. Turn right (now facing up).\n  7. Move forward (to (2, 3)).\n  8. Move forward (to (2, 4)).\n  9. Pick up (collect the YELLOW key).\n  10. Turn right (now facing right).\n  11. Move forward (to (3, 4)).\n  12. Move forward (to (4, 4)).\n  13. Move forward (to (5, 4)).\n  14. Toggle (open the door).\n\nThis is still 14 steps, but the door opening (toggle) would be the 14th step, which fits the limit.\n\n### Immediate Next Action:\nThe agent is at (4, 3), facing right. The first step is to turn left to face up.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission: Open the door\n1. **Agent Position and Orientation**: The agent is at (4, 3) and facing up (↑). \n2. **Door Location**: The door is at (5, 4) (object_type=4, color=4, state=2). The state is 2, which means it is locked.\n3. **Key Location**: There is a key at (2, 4) (object_type=5, color=4). The color of the key (4) matches the color of the door (4), so this key can unlock the door.\n\n### Steps to Complete the Mission:\n1. **Pick Up the Key**: \n   - The agent needs to move to (2, 4) to pick up the key. \n   - Currently, the agent is at (4, 3) facing up. To reach (2, 4), the agent should:\n     - Turn left to face left (←).\n     - Move forward twice to reach (2, 3).\n     - Turn right to face up (↑).\n     - Move forward once to reach (2, 4).\n     - Pick up the key.\n2. **Unlock and Open the Door**:\n   - After picking up the key, the agent should:\n     - Turn right to face right (→).\n     - Move forward three times to reach (5, 4).\n     - Use the \"toggle\" action to unlock and open the door (since the agent is carrying the matching key).\n\n### Optimal Path:\nGiven the steps remaining (13), the agent can complete this mission efficiently. Here’s the immediate next action:\n\n1. The agent is at (4, 3) facing up.

Then, use the \"toggle\" action to open the door.\n\n### Immediate Next Action:\nThe agent is at (4, 3), facing left. The first step is to move left toward the key. The cell to the left of the agent (3, 3) is empty (object_type -1, which seems to be a placeholder for empty or walkable space), so the agent can move forward.\n\n### Answer:\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Analysis:\nThe mission is to \"open the door\". From the grid observation, we can see that there is a door at position (5, 4) (object_type=4, which is DOOR). The agent is currently at (3, 3), facing left (←). \n\n### Grid Analysis:\n1. **Agent Position and Orientation**: The agent is at (3, 3), facing left (direction=2, which is left). \n2. **Door Position**: The door is at (5, 4). \n3. **Key Position**: There is a key at (2, 4) (object_type=5, which is KEY). \n4. **Path to the Door**: \n   - From (3, 3), the agent needs to move to (3, 4) (one step down), then to (4, 4), and finally to (5, 4) to face the door.\n   - However, the agent is currently facing left, so it needs to turn to face down first to move towards the key and then the door.\n\n### Steps to Complete the Mission:\n1. **Turn to Face Down**: The agent is facing left (←). To move towards the key and the door, it needs to face down. This requires a `turn_right` action (since turning right from left faces the agent down).\n2. **Move to (3, 4)**: After turning, the agent can `move_forward` to reach (3, 4).\n3. **Pick Up the Key at (2, 4)**: The agent needs to pick up the key to unlock the door. From (3, 4), it should turn left to face left (towards the key at (2, 4)), then `move_forward` to (2, 4), and `pickup` the key.\n4. **Move to the Door at (5, 4)**: After picking up the key, the agent should turn right to face down again, then `move_forward` to (4, 4), and then to (5, 4).\n5. **Toggle the Door**: At (5, 4), the agent should `toggle` the door to open it.\n\n### Immediate Next Action:\nThe agent is currently at (3, 3), facing left.

From the observation, we can see there is a door at position (5, 4) (object_type=4, color=?, state=?). The agent is currently at (3, 3), facing up (↑). \n\n### Path to the Door:\n1. The door is located at (5, 4), which is two cells to the right (x-direction) and one cell down (y-direction) from the agent's current position (3, 3).\n2. The agent is facing up, so it needs to turn to face the right direction to move towards the door.\n\n### Steps to Reach the Door:\n1. First, the agent needs to turn right to face right (since it's currently facing up).\n   - Current direction: up (3). Turning right will change the direction to right (0).\n   - Action: `turn_right`\n2. Then, the agent can move forward twice to reach (5, 3).\n   - First move: from (3, 3) to (4, 3).\n   - Second move: from (4, 3) to (5, 3).\n   - Actions: `move_forward`, `move_forward`\n3. From (5, 3), the agent needs to turn right to face down (since the door is at (5, 4)).\n   - Current direction: right (0). Turning right will change the direction to down (1).\n   - Action: `turn_right`\n4. Then, the agent can move forward once to reach (5, 4), which is the door.\n   - Action: `move_forward`\n5. Finally, the agent can toggle the door to open it.\n   - Action: `toggle`\n\n### Checking the Door State:\nThe door's state is not explicitly given in the observation, but since the mission is to \"open the door\", we can assume it is either closed or locked. If it's locked, the agent would need a key, but there is a key at (2, 4). However, the agent is not carrying anything, and the key is not directly on the path to the door. Given the steps remaining (10), it's more efficient to assume the door is closed and can be opened with `toggle`.\n\n### Optimal Action Sequence:\nGiven the above analysis, the next immediate action is to turn right to face the correct direction for moving towards the door.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Analysis:\nThe mission is to \"open the door\".

The agent is currently at (3, 3), facing right (→), and not carrying anything.\n\n### Path to the Door:\n1. The agent is at (3, 3), facing right. The cell directly in front (to the right) is (4, 3), which is empty (object_type=-1, likely FLOOR or similar, since walls are object_type=2).\n2. From (4, 3), the agent can move forward again to (5, 3), which is also empty.\n3. From (5, 3), the door is at (5, 4), which is one cell below. The agent would need to turn down (turn_right) to face the door, then use the \"toggle\" action to open it.\n\n### Steps to Achieve the Mission:\n1. Move forward from (3, 3) to (4, 3).\n2. Move forward from (4, 3) to (5, 3).\n3. Turn right to face down (towards (5, 4)).\n4. Toggle the door to open it.\n\n### Current Action:\nThe first action is to move forward from (3, 3) to (4, 3).\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Analysis:\nThe mission is to \"open the door.\" From the grid observation, we can see:\n1. The agent is at position (4, 3), facing right (→).\n2. There is a door at position (5, 4) (object_type=4, state=2, which means it is locked).\n3. There is a key at position (2, 4) (object_type=5). The color of the key is not specified as critical for this mission, but we can assume it matches the door since no other keys are present.\n\n### Steps to Complete the Mission:\n1. **Pick up the key**: The agent needs to move to the key at (2, 4) and pick it up. Currently, the agent is at (4, 3), facing right. To reach (2, 4):\n   - First, turn left to face upwards (since (2, 4) is above and to the left of the agent).\n   - Then move forward to (4, 2).\n   - Turn left again to face left.\n   - Move forward to (3, 2).\n   - Move forward to (2, 2).\n   - Turn right to face upwards.\n   - Move forward to (2, 3).\n   - Move forward to (2, 4).\n   - Pick up the key.\n2. **Open the door**: After picking up the key, the agent needs to go to the door at (5, 4):\n   - Turn right to face right.\n   - Move forward to (3, 4).\n   - Move forward to (4, 4).\n   - Move forward to (5, 4).\n   - Toggle the door to open it.\n\nHowever, given the limited steps remaining (8), we need to optimize the path. Here's a more efficient path:\n1. Turn left (now facing up).\n2. Move forward to (4, 2).\n3. Turn left (now facing left).\n4. Move forward to (3, 2).\n5. Move forward to (2, 2).\n6. Turn right (now facing up).\n7. Move forward to (2, 3).\n8. Move forward to (2, 4).\n9. Pick up the key.\n\nBut this already uses 8 steps, leaving no steps to reach the door. Therefore, the optimal immediate action is to start moving towards the key.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nThe first step is to turn left to face upwards, so the agent can start moving towards the key.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Analysis:\nThe mission is to \"open the door\". From the grid observation, we can see that there is a door at position (5, 4) (object_type=4, color=?, state=?). The agent is currently at (4, 3), facing up (↑). \n\n### Grid Analysis:\n1. **Agent Position and Orientation**: The agent is at (4, 3), facing up (↑). This means the cell directly in front of the agent is (4, 2).\n2. **Door Position**: The door is at (5, 4). To interact with the door (toggle), the agent must be adjacent to it and facing it.\n3. **Path to the Door**: \n   - From (4, 3), the agent can move right to (5, 3), then down to (5, 4) to face the door.\n   - Alternatively, the agent could move down to (4, 4), then right to (5, 4), but this would require turning to face the door after moving right.\n   - The first path (right, then down) is more straightforward and requires fewer turns.\n\n### Steps to Open the Door:\n1. **Move Right**: From (4, 3), move right to (5, 3). This will position the agent next to the door.\n   - Check if the path is clear: The cell to the right (5, 3) is empty (object_type=-1, which seems to be a placeholder; assuming it's walkable).\n2. **Turn Right**: After moving right, the agent will be at (5, 3), still facing up. To face the door at (5, 4), the agent needs to turn right (to face down).\n3. **Toggle the Door**: Now the agent is at (5, 3), facing down, and the door is at (5, 4). The agent can toggle the door to open it.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n1. `move_forward` (to move right to (5, 3); assuming \"move_forward\" moves in the current facing direction, but the agent is facing up, so this would move to (4, 2), which is not desired. Correction: the agent needs to turn right first to face right, then move forward.)\n   - Wait, the agent is facing up (↑). To move right, the agent must first turn right to face right (→), then move forward.\n   - So the correct sequence is:\n     - `turn_right` (now facing right →)\n     - `move_forward` (move to (5, 3))\n     - `turn_right` (now facing down ↓)\n     - `toggle` (open the door at (5, 4))\n\nHowever, the grid shows that (5, 3) is object_type=2 (WALL), so the agent cannot move there. This means the initial plan is invalid. Let's re-evaluate:\n\n### Revised Plan:\nThe agent is at (4, 3), facing up (↑). The door is at (5, 4). The agent cannot move right to (5, 3) because it's a wall. Alternative path:\n1. Move down to (4, 4) (facing up, so cannot move down; must turn first).\n   - Turn right (now facing right →)\n   - Move forward to (5, 3) (but this is a wall, so invalid).\n   - Turn left (now facing up ↑)\n   - Move forward to (4, 2) (but this is not towards the door).\nThis seems stuck. Wait, the agent is at (4, 3), facing up. The door is at (5, 4). The agent must:\n1. Turn right (now facing right →)\n2. Move forward to (5, 3) (but this is a wall, so cannot move).\n3. Turn left (now facing up ↑)\n4. Move forward to (4, 2) (away from door).\nThis seems impossible. \n\nWait, perhaps the door is at (5, 4), and the agent can reach it by:\n1. Turn left (now facing left ←)\n2. Move forward to (3, 3) (assuming this is walkable)\n3. Turn right (now facing down ↓)\n4. Move forward to (3, 4)\n5. Turn right (now facing right →)\n6. Move forward to (4, 4)\n7. Turn right (now facing up ↑)\n8. Move forward to (4, 3) (back to start).\nThis is not helpful.\n\n### Re-examining the Grid:\nThe grid seems to have many -1 values, which might represent empty\/walkable cells. The agent is at (4, 3), facing up. The door is at (5, 4). The agent can:\n1. Turn right (now facing right →)\n2. Move forward to (5, 3) (if (5, 3) is walkable; grid shows object_type=-1, which might be walkable)\n   - If (5, 3) is walkable, proceed:\n     - Move forward to (5, 3)\n     - Turn right (now facing down ↓)\n     - Toggle the door at (5, 4).\n\nGiven the ambiguity in the grid (many -1 values), the most plausible sequence is:\n1. `turn_right` (face right →)\n2. `move_forward` (move to (5, 3))\n3. `turn_right` (face down ↓)\n4. `toggle` (open door at (5, 4))\n\nSince we can only output one action at a time, the first action is `turn_right`.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Analysis:\nThe mission is to \"open the door.\" From the grid observation, the only door is located at (5, 4) (object_type=4, color=?, state=?). The agent is currently at (4, 3), facing right (→), and is not carrying anything. \n\n### Path to the Door:\n1. The agent is at (4, 3), facing right. \n2. The door is at (5, 4), which is one step to the right (x+1) and one step down (y+1) from the agent's current position.\n3. To reach the door, the agent must:\n   - Move forward to (5, 3) (since it's facing right).\n   - Turn right to face down (since the door is below).\n   - Move forward to (5, 4) to face the door.\n   - Use the \"toggle\" action to open the door.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The agent does not need to pick up any keys because the door's state is not specified as locked (state=2). If it were locked, we would need to find a matching key first.\n- There are no obstacles (walls or lava) blocking the path to the door.\n- The agent has 6 steps remaining, which is sufficient for the required actions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Actions:\n1.

From the observation, we can see that there is a door at position (5, 4) (object_type=4, state=2, which means it's locked). To open a locked door, we need a key of the same color. \n\n### Key Location:\nThere is a key at position (2, 4) (object_type=5, color=5 (GREY)). However, the door at (5, 4) is also color=5 (GREY), so this key matches the door.\n\n### Agent's Position and Path:\n- The agent is at (4, 3), facing right (→).\n- The key is at (2, 4), which is two cells to the left and one cell up from the agent's current position.\n- The door is at (5, 4), which is one cell to the right and one cell up from the agent's current position.\n\n### Steps to Complete the Mission:\n1. Move to the key at (2, 4):\n   - First, the agent needs to turn left to face upwards (since it's currently facing right and the key is up and to the left).\n   - Then move forward to (4, 2).\n   - Turn left to face left.\n   - Move forward to (3, 2).\n   - Move forward to (2, 2).\n   - Turn right to face upwards.\n   - Move forward to (2, 3).\n   - Move forward to (2, 4).\n   - Pick up the key.\n\nHowever, the agent only has 5 steps remaining, which is not enough to reach the key and then the door. Therefore, we need to prioritize the most immediate action that can be taken within the remaining steps.\n\nGiven the limited steps, the best immediate action is to move towards the door. Since the agent is facing right, the door is at (5, 4), which is one cell right and one cell up. The agent cannot move diagonally, so the next best action is to move forward (right) to (5, 3), then turn upwards to face the door.\n\nBut with only 5 steps, even this might not be enough. The most immediate action is to move forward (right) to (5, 3).\n\nHowever, looking at the grid, (5, 3) is a wall (object_type=2), so the agent cannot move there. The next cell in the direction the agent is facing (right) is (5, 3), which is a wall, so the agent cannot move forward.\n\nGiven this, the only possible action is to turn left to face upwards, then move forward to (4, 2), but this also seems blocked. \n\nUpon closer inspection, the grid shows that (4, 4) is empty (object_type=-1), so the agent can move forward to (5, 3), but (5, 3) is a wall. \n\nThis suggests the grid might have some inconsistencies, but based on the given observation, the immediate action is to turn left to face upwards, then move forward to (4, 2).\n\nGiven the time constraints, the best immediate action is to turn left to face upwards.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: turn_left","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Analysis:\nThe mission is to \"open the door\".

Assuming the door is either closed or locked, the agent should prepare to pick up the key if needed.\n4. The agent has 4 steps remaining, which is enough to:\n   - Move to the key (if needed), then to the door.\n   - Or directly to the door if it is not locked.\n\n### Path Planning:\nGiven the uncertainty about the door's state, the safest approach is to pick up the key first, then proceed to the door. Here's the step-by-step plan:\n1. Turn right to face right (→). Current direction: up (↑), turning right will face the agent right (→).\n2. Move forward to (5, 3).\n3. Turn left to face down (↓).\n4. Move forward to (5, 4) to face the door.\n5. Use \"toggle\" to open the door.\n\nHowever, since the agent only has 4 steps remaining, we cannot complete the full plan. Instead, we can try to reach the door directly:\n1. Turn right to face right (→).\n2. Move forward to (5, 3).\n3. Turn left to face down (↓).\n4. Move forward to (5, 4) to face the door.\nBut this also takes 4 steps, leaving no action to \"toggle\" the door. \n\nAlternatively, if the door is not locked, we can try to reach it directly without the key:\n1. Turn right to face right (→).\n2. Move forward to (5, 3).\n3. Turn left to face down (↓).\n4. Move forward to (5, 4) to face the door.\nBut again, no action remains to \"toggle\".\n\nGiven the constraints, the best immediate action is to turn right to start moving toward the door.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this problem, let's analyze the given grid and mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Analysis:\nThe mission is to \"open the door.\" From the observation, we can see:\n1. The agent is at position (4, 3), facing right (→).\n2. There is a door at position (5, 4) (object_type=4, state=2, which means it's locked).\n3. There is a key at position (2, 4) (object_type=5). The color of the key is not specified, but since the door is locked, we assume the key matches the door (as no other keys are present).\n\n### Steps to Complete the Mission:\n1. **Pick up the key**: The agent needs to move to the key at (2, 4) and pick it up. Currently, the agent is at (4, 3), facing right. To reach (2, 4):\n   - First, the agent needs to turn left (to face up) and move forward to (4, 2).\n   - Then, turn left again (to face left) and move forward to (3, 2).\n   - Then, move forward to (2, 2).\n   - Then, turn right (to face up) and move forward to (2, 3).\n   - Finally, move forward to (2, 4) and pick up the key.\n   However, this path is too long given the limited steps (only 3 remaining). \n\n   Alternatively, the agent can:\n   - Turn left (to face up), move forward to (4, 2).\n   - Turn left (to face left), move forward to (3, 2).\n   - Turn right (to face down), move forward to (3, 3).\n   - But this still doesn't reach the key in 3 steps.\n\n   Given the step limit, the agent cannot reach the key in 3 steps. Thus, the only feasible action is to move toward the door and attempt to open it (though it's locked, this is the only possible action within the step limit).\n\n2. **Move toward the door**: The door is at (5, 4). The agent is at (4, 3), facing right. The next cell to the right is (5, 3), which is empty (object_type=-1, meaning it's walkable). From there, the agent can turn right (to face down) and move to (5, 4) to face the door.\n\n### Optimal Action Given Step Limit:\nWith only 3 steps remaining, the best immediate action is to move toward the door. The agent is facing right, so the first action is to move forward to (5, 3).\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe agent should move forward to (5, 3) as the first step toward the door.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","To solve this problem, let's analyze the given grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Analysis:\nThe mission is to \"open the door\". From the grid observation, the only door is located at position (5, 4) (object_type=4, color=?, state=?). The agent is at (4, 3), facing right (→), and is not carrying anything. \n\n### Grid Observation:\n- The agent is at (4, 3), facing right (→). \n- The cell to the right of the agent (5, 3) is empty (object_type=-1, which seems to represent a walkable space based on the grid layout).\n- The door is at (5, 4), which is one cell to the right and one cell down from the agent's current position.\n\n### Steps to Open the Door:\n1. The agent needs to reach the door to interact with it. Since the door is at (5, 4), the agent must first move to (5, 3) (directly to the right of its current position), then turn down (→ to ↓) to face the door at (5, 4), and then use the \"toggle\" action to open it.\n2. However, the agent only has 2 steps remaining, which means it can only perform 2 actions. The sequence to open the door would require:\n   - Move forward to (5, 3) (1 step).\n   - Turn right to face down (→ to ↓) (2nd step).\n   - Then \"toggle\" to open the door (but this would be the 3rd step, which is not allowed).\n3. Alternatively, if the door is already closed but not locked (state=1), the agent could \"toggle\" it directly if it is facing the door. However, the agent is not currently facing the door (it's facing right, and the door is below and to the right).\n\nGiven the limited steps (only 2), the best the agent can do is move toward the door. The first action should be \"move_forward\" to (5, 3), and the second action would be \"turn_right\" to face the door, but the \"toggle\" action would require a third step. \n\nSince the mission is to \"open the door\" and the agent cannot complete this in 2 steps, the optimal action is to move toward the door with the first step.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe agent should move forward to (5, 3) as the first step. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","Let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. The agent is at position (4,3) facing right (→)\n2. The mission is to \"open the door\"\n3. Looking at the grid, there's a door at position (5,4) - one cell to the right and one cell down from the agent's current position\n4. The agent is not carrying anything and has only 1 step remaining\n\nTo open the door:\n- First, the agent would need to move right to (5,3) and then down to (5,4) to face the door\n- However, with only 1 step remaining, the agent can't reach the door in this turn\n- The agent can't perform any useful action with just 1 step remaining to complete the mission\n\nSince no progress can be made toward opening the door with just 1 step remaining, the most reasonable action is to move forward to position (5,3) to get closer to the door, even though the mission can't be completed this turn.\n\nAnswer: move_forward"],"prompt":"\n    You are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a game board and rules.\n    Your task is:\n    - First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n    - Second, output the answer in the required format.

The door is directly in front of the agent, so no movement is needed.\n2. Since the agent is facing the door, we can use the \"toggle\" action to open it.\n\n### Verification:\n- No keys are needed (assuming the door is closed, not locked).\n- No obstacles are between the agent and the door.\n- The agent is already facing the door, so no turning is required.\n\n### Final Action:\nThe optimal action is to \"toggle\" the door.\n\nAnswer: toggle","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Analysis:\nThe mission is to \"open the door.\" From the observation, we can see that there is a door at position (5, 4) (object_type=4, state=1, which means it's closed). The agent is currently at (4, 4), facing right (→), so the door is directly to the agent's right.\n\n### Steps to Open the Door:\n1. The door is adjacent to the agent and in the direction the agent is facing (right). \n2. Since the door is closed (state=1), the agent can use the \"toggle\" action to open it. No key is required because the door is not locked (state=1 is closed, state=2 would be locked).\n\n### Action:\nThe agent should perform the \"toggle\" action to open the door.\n\nAnswer: toggle","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Analysis:\nThe mission is to \"open the door\". From the observation, we can see that there is a door at position (5, 4) (object_type=4, state=2, which means it is locked). The agent is currently at (4, 4), facing right (→), so the door is directly to the right of the agent. \n\n### Steps to Open the Door:\n1. **Check Door State**: The door at (5, 4) is locked (state=2), so we need a key to unlock it.\n2. **Find Key**: Looking around the grid, there is a key at position (3, 1) (object_type=5). The key is green (color=1), but the door's color is not specified in the observation (since the door's color is not visible in the provided grid snippet). However, since the mission is to open the door, we can assume the key matches the door (or the door doesn't require a specific color key).\n3. **Path to Key**: \n   - The agent is at (4, 4), facing right. To reach the key at (3, 1), the agent needs to:\n     - Turn left to face up (since (3, 1) is above and to the left of (4, 4)).\n     - Move forward to (4, 3), then (4, 2), then (4, 1).\n     - Turn left to face left.\n     - Move forward to (3, 1).\n   - However, the grid shows walls (object_type=2) at (4, 3), (4, 2), and (4, 1), so this path is blocked. \n   - Alternative path: \n     - Turn right to face down.\n     - Move forward to (4, 5), but (4, 5) is a wall (object_type=2), so this is also blocked.\n     - Turn left to face up (back to original direction).\n     - The only viable direction is right, but the door is locked, so we cannot proceed that way.\n4. **Re-evaluate**: The grid seems to have walls blocking all paths to the key. This suggests the mission might be unsolvable as given, or there might be missing information (e.g., another key or door). \n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the current observation, the agent cannot reach the key to unlock the door. The only possible action is to attempt to interact with the door (toggle), but since it's locked, this will fail. However, \"toggle\" is the only action that aligns with the mission (\"open the door\"), even if it won't succeed. \n\nAnswer: toggle","To solve this problem, let's analyze the given grid and mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Analysis:\nThe mission is to \"open the door.\" From the observation, we can see that there is a door at position (5, 4) (object_type=4, color=-1, state=?). The agent is currently at (4, 4), facing right (→), so the door is directly to the right of the agent.\n\n### Door State:\nThe door's state is not explicitly provided in the observation (state=-1), but typically, doors can be open, closed, or locked. Since the mission is to \"open the door,\" we can assume the door is either closed or locked. \n\n### Agent's Position and Orientation:\n- Agent is at (4, 4), facing right (→).\n- The door is at (5, 4), which is directly to the right of the agent.\n\n### Required Actions:\n1. The agent is already facing the door (right), so no turning is needed.\n2. If the door is closed (state=1), the agent can simply use the \"toggle\" action to open it.\n3. If the door is locked (state=2), the agent would need to find and pick up a matching key first. However, there is no key visible in the immediate vicinity (the nearest key is at (3, 1), which is far away and not directly accessible without moving through walls or other obstacles). Given the grid layout, it seems unlikely the door is locked because there is no clear path to a key.\n\nGiven the mission is to \"open the door\" and the agent is already facing the door, the most straightforward action is to \"toggle\" the door to open it.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: toggle","Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. The agent is at position (4,4) facing right (→)\n2. The mission is to \"open the door\"\n3. Looking at the grid, there's a door at position (5,4) - directly to the right of the agent\n4. The door's state isn't visible in the observation (it shows -1), but since the mission is to open it, we can assume it's either closed or locked\n5. The agent isn't carrying anything, so if the door is locked, we'd need to find a key first\n6. However, looking around the grid, the only visible key is at (3,1), which is quite far away\n7.

There is a key at position (3, 1) (object_type=5, color=1 (GREEN)).\n\n### Steps to Complete the Mission:\n1. The door is locked (state=2), so we need a matching key to open it. The key at (3, 1) is GREEN, but we don't know the color of the door yet (color is not provided in the observation for the door). However, since the mission is to open the door, we can assume the key matches the door or that the door can be toggled without a key (but the rules state locked doors need a matching key).\n2. The agent is not carrying anything, so we need to pick up the key first.\n3. To reach the key at (3, 1):\n   - The agent is at (4, 4), facing right. To move towards (3, 1), the agent needs to turn left (to face up), move forward to (4, 3), then turn left again (to face left), and move forward to (3, 3), then turn left (to face down), and move forward to (3, 2), then turn right (to face left), and move forward to (3, 1).\n   - Alternatively, a more efficient path: turn left (now facing up), move forward to (4, 3), turn left (now facing left), move forward to (3, 3), turn right (now facing down), move forward to (3, 2), turn left (now facing left), move forward to (3, 1).\n4. After picking up the key, the agent needs to go back to the door at (5, 4):\n   - From (3, 1), turn right (facing down), move forward to (3, 2), turn right (facing right), move forward to (4, 2), turn right (facing up), move forward to (4, 3), turn left (facing right), move forward to (5, 3), turn right (facing down), move forward to (5, 4).\n5. Now, the agent is facing the door (facing down, door is at (5, 4)), and can use the key to toggle the door open.\n\n### Immediate Next Action:\nThe agent is at (4, 4), facing right.

The key is at (3, 1), which is up and to the left.\n- The agent needs to:\n  1. Turn left to face left (←).\n  2. Move forward to (3, 4).\n  3. Turn left to face down (↓) — no, this is not helpful.\n  4. Alternatively, from (4, 4), turn right to face left (←) — no, currently facing down, turn left is right.\n\nWait, let's simplify:\n- From (4, 4), facing down (↓), the key is at (3, 1), which is up and to the left.\n- The agent needs to face left (←) first, so:\n  1. Turn left (now facing right (→)? No, current direction is down (↓), turn left is facing right (→)? Wait, direction: 0=right, 1=down, 2=left, 3=up. The agent is facing down (1), so turn_left would change direction to right (0)? No, turn_left is counter-clockwise, so down (1) → right (0)? Or is it down (1) → left (2)? The note says: \"For AGENT (10), this is direction: 0=right, 1=down, 2=left, 3=up\". So turn_left from down (1) is right (0)? That doesn't make sense. turn_left from down should be facing right? Or is it left? Let me think: starting at right (0), turn_left would face up (3), turn_left again faces left (2), turn_left again faces down (1), turn_left again faces right (0). So turn_left is +3 mod 4. So from down (1), turn_left is (1 + 3) mod 4 = 0 (right). That seems odd, but okay.\n\nAssuming turn_left from down (1) faces right (0):\n1. turn_left (now facing right (→)).\n2. move_forward to (5, 4) — but (5, 4) is the door, which is locked, so cannot move there.\nSo this is not helpful.\n\nAlternative: turn_right from down (1) is (1 + 1) mod 4 = 2 (left).\n1. turn_right (now facing left (←)).\n2. move_forward to (3, 4).\n3. Now, to reach (3, 1), need to go up. So turn_right to face up (↑) (from left (2), turn_right is (2 + 1) mod 4 = 3 (up)).\n4. move_forward to (3, 3).\n5. move_forward to (3, 2).\n6. move_forward to (3, 1).\n7. pickup the key.\n8.

Maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, perhaps the door is not locked but closed (state=1). The observation shows the door at (5, 4) has state=2 (locked), so we do need the key.\n\nGiven the time, let's start with the first step: the agent is at (4, 4), facing down (↓), and needs to go towards the key at (3, 1).

The agent is currently at (4, 4), facing left (←). \n\n### Grid Analysis:\n1. **Agent Position and Orientation**: The agent is at (4, 4), facing left (direction=2, which corresponds to left). \n2. **Door Position**: The door is at (5, 4), which is directly to the right of the agent. However, the agent is facing left, so the door is behind the agent.\n3. **Key Position**: There is a key (object_type=5) at position (3, 1). The key is not directly in the agent's path to the door, but the door might be locked (state=2 for locked doors). \n\n### Steps to Open the Door:\n1. **Check Door State**: The door at (5, 4) has state=2, which means it is locked. To open a locked door, the agent needs a key of the same color as the door.\n   - The door's color is not explicitly given in the observation, but the key at (3, 1) is color=5 (GREY).

The agent is at (3, 4), facing left. The door is at (5, 4), which is two cells to the right of the agent's current position.\n2. Since the agent is facing left, it needs to turn around to face right to move towards the door.\n\n### Steps to Complete the Mission:\n1. **Turn Right**: The agent is facing left, so turning right will make it face down.\n   - After `turn_right`, the agent faces down.\n2. **Turn Right Again**: Turning right again will make the agent face right (towards the door).\n   - After another `turn_right`, the agent faces right.\n3. **Move Forward**: Move towards the door. The agent is at (3, 4), and the door is at (5, 4), so it needs to move forward twice to reach (5, 4).\n   - First `move_forward` takes the agent to (4, 4).\n   - Second `move_forward` takes the agent to (5, 4), facing the door.\n4. **Toggle the Door**: Since the door is locked (state=2), the agent cannot open it directly. It needs a key matching the door's color (YELLOW). However, there is no key visible in the grid (the only key is at (3, 1), which is a GREEN key and not useful here). This suggests the mission might be unsolvable as currently presented, but the grid shows the door is at (5, 4), and the agent can reach it.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, the grid shows that the cell (5, 4) is `[5, 4, 4]`, which is a YELLOW door (state=4 is not defined in the rules, but assuming it's locked). Since no key is available, the mission cannot be completed. But the grid seems inconsistent because the door at (5, 4) is not locked (state=4 is invalid; state should be 0, 1, or 2). Assuming it's a closed door (state=1), the agent can `toggle` it.\n\nGiven the confusion, the most likely correct action is to move towards the door and attempt to toggle it.\n\n### Final Action:\nThe agent needs to turn right twice to face right, then move forward twice to reach the door, and then toggle it.

The optimal sequence is:\n1. `move_forward` (from (3,4) to (4,4))\n2. `move_forward` (from (4,4) to (5,4))\n3. `toggle` (to open the door)\n\nThe first action in this sequence is `move_forward`.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. Current Position: The agent is at (4,4) facing right (→). The cell directly in front (to the right) is (5,4), which contains [4, ?, ?] - this is a door (object_type=4).\n\n2. Door Status: The door at (5,4) has state=2 (locked), so we need a matching key to open it. \n\n3. Key Location: Looking at the grid, there's a key at (3,1) with [5, ?, ?] (object_type=5). The agent needs to pick this up first.\n\n4. Path to Key:\n   - First, the agent needs to turn left (to face up) to start moving toward the key.\n   - Then move forward multiple times to reach (3,1).\n   - Pick up the key.\n   - Return to the door.\n   - Use the key to unlock and open the door.\n\nHowever, since the immediate task is to \"open the door\" and we're already facing a locked door, the first required action is to go get the key. The first step in that process is to turn to face the direction where the key is located.\n\nThe key is at (3,1) which is up and to the left from (4,4), so we should turn left first to face upward.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission: Open the door\nFrom the observation:\n- The agent is at position (4, 4), facing up (↑).\n- The door is located at position (5, 4), which is directly to the right of the agent (since the agent is facing up, its right is the positive x-direction).\n- The door's state is not explicitly given in the observation, but since the mission is to \"open the door,\" we can assume it is either closed or locked. However, the observation shows the door at (5, 4) with object_type=4 (DOOR), but the state is not provided in the grid snippet. Given the mission, we'll proceed to interact with it.\n\n### Steps to open the door:\n1. The agent is currently facing up (↑). To face the door (which is to its right), the agent needs to turn right (clockwise).\n2. After turning right, the agent will face right (→), and the door will be directly in front of it at (5, 4).\n3. The agent can then use the \"toggle\" action to open the door.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n1. `turn_right` (to face the door)\n2. `toggle` (to open the door)\n\nSince we can only output one action at a time, the first action is `turn_right`.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Analysis:\nThe mission is to \"open the door.\" From the observation, the door is located at position (5, 4) (object_type=4, which is a door). The agent is currently at (4, 4), facing right (→), so the door is directly to the right of the agent.\n\n### Door State:\nThe door at (5, 4) has state=2, which means it is locked (state: 0=open, 1=closed, 2=locked). To open a locked door, the agent needs a matching key. \n\n### Key Location:\nLooking at the grid, there is a key at position (3, 1) (object_type=5, which is a key). The key's color is 5 (GREY), but since the door's color is not specified in the observation, we assume the key matches the door (as no other keys are present).\n\n### Steps to Complete the Mission:\n1. Move to the key at (3, 1):\n   - From (4, 4), the agent needs to move left to (3, 4), then up to (3, 1).\n2. Pick up the key.\n3. Return to the door at (5, 4):\n   - Move down to (3, 4), then right to (4, 4), then right to (5, 4).\n4. Toggle the door to open it.\n\n### Immediate Next Action:\nThe agent is at (4, 4), facing right. To reach the key at (3, 1), the agent must first turn left (to face up) and then move forward to (4, 3). However, the observation shows that (4, 3) is empty (object_type=-1, which seems invalid; likely a typo and should be traversable). Assuming (4, 3) is traversable, the first action is to turn left to face up.\n\nHowever, looking at the grid more carefully:\n- The agent is at (4, 4), facing right. The cell to the right is (5, 4), which is the locked door. The cell above is (4, 3), which seems invalid (object_type=-1), so likely a wall or obstacle. The cell to the left is (3, 4), which is empty (object_type=-1, but likely traversable). \n\nThus, the correct immediate action is to turn left (to face up), then move forward to (4, 3) if possible. But since (4, 3) seems invalid, the alternative is to turn left twice (to face left) and move to (3, 4).\n\nGiven the confusion in the grid data, the safest immediate action is to turn left to face up, then assess the next move.\n\n### Final Decision:\nThe immediate action is to turn left to start navigating toward the key.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","To solve this problem, let's analyze the game board and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Analysis:\nThe mission is to \"open the door.\" From the observation, we can see that there is a door at position (5, 4) (object_type=4, state=1 (closed)).

The key's color is not specified, but since the door's color is not given either, we assume the key matches the door (as no other keys are visible).\n3. **Path to the Key**: \n   - From (4, 4), the agent needs to move left to (3, 4), then up to (3, 1) to pick up the key.\n   - Currently, the agent is facing right, so it needs to turn left to face up (since moving left from (4,4) would require facing left first).\n4. **Return to the Door**: After picking up the key, the agent needs to return to (4, 4) and then move right to (5, 4) to toggle (unlock) the door.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nThe agent is at (4, 4), facing right. To reach the key at (3, 1), the agent must first turn left to face up (since (3,1) is up and to the left from (4,4)). \n\n### Answer:\nThe first action is to turn left to face up.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","To solve this problem, let's analyze the given grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Analysis:\nThe mission is to \"open the door\".

The agent is currently at (4, 4), facing up (↑). \n\n### Steps to Open the Door:\n1. **Check Door State**: The door at (5, 4) is closed (state=1). To open it, the agent needs to face the door and use the \"toggle\" action.\n2. **Agent's Position and Orientation**: The agent is at (4, 4), facing up (↑). The door is to the right of the agent (since (5, 4) is one cell to the right of (4, 4)). \n3. **Adjust Orientation**: The agent needs to face right to interact with the door.

The key's properties are:\n- object_type: 5 (KEY)\n- color: 5 (GREY)\n  \nWait, the key's color is GREY (5), but the door's color is YELLOW (4). This means the key does not match the door's color, so we cannot use it to unlock the door. \n\nHowever, the door is the only interactable object in the grid, and the mission is to \"open the door.\" Since the door is locked and there is no matching key, we cannot unlock it.

The door is directly to the right of the agent (since (5,4) is one cell to the right of (4,4)).\n\n### Current Agent State:\n- Position: (4, 4)\n- Facing: Up (↑)\n- Not carrying anything.\n\n### Door State:\nThe door at (5, 4) is a wall (object_type=2) in the observation, but the description mentions it is a door (object_type=4). This seems contradictory, but assuming the door is at (5,4) and is closed or locked, we need to interact with it.\n\n### Steps to Open the Door:\n1. The agent is facing up, but the door is to its right. So, the agent needs to turn right to face the door.\n2.

The agent is currently at (4, 4), facing right (→), which means the door is directly to the right of the agent.\n\n### Steps to Open the Door:\n1. The door is closed (state=1), so we need to use the `toggle` action to open it.\n2. The agent is already facing the door (since it's to the right and the agent is facing right), so no turning is needed.\n3.

This means the cell directly above the agent is (4, 3).\n\n2. **Mission**: \"open the door\". Looking at the grid, there is a door at (5, 4) (object_type=4, state=2, which means it's locked). \n\n3. **Key Availability**: There is a key at (3, 1) (object_type=5). The key's color is not specified in the observation, but since the door is locked (state=2), we likely need to pick up the key first to unlock the door.\n\n4. **Path to the Key**: \n   - From (4, 4), the agent needs to move left to (3, 4), then up to (3, 3), then up to (3, 2), then up to (3, 1) to pick up the key.\n   - After picking up the key, the agent can return to (4, 4) and then move right to (5, 4) to toggle the door.\n\n5. **Immediate Action**: The agent is currently facing up. The cell directly above (4, 3) is empty (object_type=-1, which seems to be a placeholder for empty or walkable space), so the agent can move forward.\n\nHowever, since the mission is to \"open the door\" and the door is locked, the first step is to pick up the key. The agent needs to turn left to face left (towards the key), then move forward to (3, 4), and then proceed upwards to (3, 1).\n\nGiven the current orientation (up), the first action should be to turn left to face left (towards the key).\n\nAnswer: turn_left","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Analysis:\nThe mission is to \"open the door.\" From the grid observation, we can see that there is a door (object_type=4) at position (5, 4). The agent is currently at (4, 4), facing left (←), which means the door is directly to the right of the agent (since left-facing means the agent's \"forward\" is to the left, but the door is to the right).\n\n### Door State:\nThe door at (5, 4) has state=2, which means it is locked (state 2 for doors is locked). To open a locked door, the agent must:\n1. Find a key of the same color as the door.\n2. Pick up the key.\n3. Move to the door and use the \"toggle\" action to unlock and open it.\n\n### Key Location:\nLooking at the grid, there is a key (object_type=5) at position (3, 1). The key's color is 5 (GREY). We need to check the door's color to see if it matches. The door at (5, 4) has color=2 (BLUE), so the key at (3, 1) does not match the door's color. There are no other keys visible in the grid, so this is problematic.\n\nHowever, the grid observation seems incomplete or truncated (many cells are marked as [-1, -1, -1], which is not a valid state). Assuming the grid is correctly represented and there are no other keys, the mission cannot be completed because there is no matching key for the door.\n\nBut let's assume the key at (3, 1) is the correct one (perhaps the door's color is misrepresented). Here's the plan:\n1. Move from (4, 4) to (3, 1) to pick up the key.\n2. Return to the door at (5, 4) and toggle it.\n\n### Path to Key:\nFrom (4, 4), the agent is facing left (←). To reach (3, 1):\n- First, turn right to face down (since (3, 1) is above and to the left, but the agent is at (4, 4), so moving left is not directly helpful).\nWait, no: (3, 1) is to the left and up from (4, 4). The agent is facing left, so moving forward would go to (3, 4), then need to go up to (3, 1).\n\nBut the grid shows walls or invalid cells in many places, so movement might be restricted. Assuming the agent can move left to (3, 4), then up to (3, 1).\n\n### Actions:\n1. The agent is at (4, 4), facing left. The door is to its right (at (5, 4)), but we need the key first.\n2. Move left to (3, 4): \"move_forward\".\n3. Turn left to face up (since (3, 1) is above): \"turn_left\".\n4. Move up to (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1): \"move_forward\" three times.\n5. Pick up the key at (3, 1): \"pickup\".\n6. Return to (3, 4): face down, move down.\n7. Turn right to face right, move to (5, 4), toggle the door.\n\nBut given the grid constraints, the immediate next action is to move left to (3, 4).\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe next action is to move forward (left) to (3, 4).\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Let's analyze the situation:\n\n1. The agent is at position (3,4) facing left (←)\n2. The mission is to \"open the door\"\n3.

The agent is currently facing left, so it needs to turn around to face the door\n5. The door appears to be closed (state=1) and not locked (since there's no key in the immediate vicinity that would match it)\n6. The agent isn't carrying anything, so if the door were locked, we'd need to find a key first - but in this case it seems we can just toggle it\n\nThe sequence should be:\n1.

The door is currently closed or locked (state=2 for locked or state=1 for closed; the grid shows state=4, but this seems inconsistent with the rules. Assuming it's a closed\/locked door based on the mission).\n\n### Agent Position and Orientation:\n- The agent is at (3, 4), facing up (↑).\n- The door is at (5, 4), which is to the right of the agent's current position (since the agent is facing up, \"right\" is relative to the agent's perspective).\n\n### Path to the Door:\n1.

The color of the key is not specified, but if the door is locked, the agent might need a matching key. However, the mission is to \"open the door,\" not necessarily to unlock it. If the door is just closed (not locked), the agent can use \"toggle\" to open it without a key.\n- Since the agent is not carrying anything and the door's state is unclear, we'll assume the door is closed (not locked) and can be opened with \"toggle\".\n\n### Steps to Complete the Mission:\n1.

Its state is not explicitly given in the observation, but since the mission is to \"open the door,\" we can assume it is either closed or locked.\n   - To interact with the door (open it), the agent must be facing it and use the `toggle` action. If the door is locked, the agent would need a matching key first, but there is no key in the immediate vicinity (the only key is at (3, 1), which is far away and not relevant unless the door is locked).\n\n3. **Path to the Door**:\n   - The agent is at (4, 4), and the door is at (5, 4).

The door is directly to the right of the agent.\n\n### Door State:\nThe door at (5, 4) has state=2, which means it is locked (state 2 for doors means locked). To open a locked door, the agent needs to:\n1. Pick up a key that matches the door's color.\n2. Use the key to unlock the door by facing the door and using the \"toggle\" action.\n\n### Key Location:\nLooking at the grid, there is a key at position (3, 1) (object_type=5, which is a key). The key's color is 5 (GREY). However, we don't know the color of the door at (5, 4) because its color is not explicitly given in the observation (the color value is -1, which might indicate no color or default color).

Turning right will make it face right (towards the door at (5, 4)).\n2. **Move Forward**: After turning right, the agent can move forward to reach (5, 4), where the door is located.\n3. **Toggle the Door**: Once at the door, the agent can use \"toggle\" to open it.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n1. `turn_right` (to face the door).\n2. `move_forward` (to reach the door).\n3. `toggle` (to open the door).\n\nSince we can only output one action at a time, the first action is `turn_right`.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: turn_right","To solve this problem, let's analyze the grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Analysis:\nThe mission is to \"open the door\".

The color of the key is not specified as critical for this mission, but we need to pick it up to unlock the door.\n\n3. **Steps Remaining**:\n   - The agent has 2 steps remaining. This is likely a constraint on the number of actions we can take.\n\n### Steps to Complete the Mission:\n1. **Pick Up the Key**:\n   - The key is at (3, 1). From the agent's current position (4, 4), we need to move to (3, 1) to pick it up.\n   - However, the agent only has 2 steps remaining, which is insufficient to reach the key and then the door. This suggests that the \"steps remaining\" might be a misleading or incorrect constraint, or perhaps the mission is impossible with the given steps.\n\n2. **Alternative Interpretation**:\n   - If the door is already closed (not locked), we could \"toggle\" it to open it. However, the door is locked (state=2), so we cannot open it without the key.\n   - Since the key is unreachable in 2 steps, the mission cannot be completed as given.\n\n3. **Possible Misinterpretation**:\n   - If the door at (5, 4) is actually closed (state=1) and not locked (state=2), then we could \"toggle\" it to open it. But the observation clearly shows state=2 (locked).\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the current observation and constraints, the mission \"open the door\" cannot be completed because the door is locked, the key is too far away, and the agent has insufficient steps to reach the key and then the door. \n\nHowever, if we ignore the \"steps remaining\" constraint (assuming it's not critical), the correct sequence would be:\n1. Move to the key at (3, 1) and pick it up.\n2. Return to the door at (5, 4) and toggle it to unlock and open it.\n\nBut since we must provide a single action now, and the door is directly to the right of the agent (though locked), the only possible action is to attempt to interact with it (even though it will fail without the key). \n\nThus, the best immediate action is:\nAnswer: toggle","To solve this problem, let's analyze the given grid and the mission step by step.\n\n### Mission Analysis:\nThe mission is to \"open the door\". From the observation, we can see that there is a door (object_type=4) at position (5, 4). The agent is currently at (4, 4), facing right (→), so the door is directly to the right of the agent.\n\n### Door State:\nThe door at (5, 4) has the following properties:\n- object_type: 4 (DOOR)\n- color: 2 (BLUE)\n- state: 1 (closed)\n\nSince the door is closed but not locked (state=1, not 2), we can open it by using the \"toggle\" action while facing it.\n\n### Agent's Position and Orientation:\n- The agent is at (4, 4), facing right (→).\n- The door is at (5, 4), which is directly to the right of the agent.\n- The agent is already facing the door, so no turning is needed.\n\n### Steps to Complete the Mission:\n1. The agent is facing the closed door at (5, 4).\n2. Use the \"toggle\" action to open the door.\n\n### Action Selection:\nSince the agent is already facing the door and the door is closed (not locked), the optimal action is to \"toggle\" the door to open it.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: toggle"],"prompt":"\n    You are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a game board and rules.\n    Your task is:\n    - First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n    - Second, output the answer in the required format.
