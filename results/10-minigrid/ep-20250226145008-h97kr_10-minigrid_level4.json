To open the red door and then the blue door, the first step is to move towards the doors. Since the agent is facing right and there is an open path in that direction, the optimal first action is to move forward.\nAnswer: move_forward","1. First, understand the current situation:\n   - The agent is at position (7, 1) facing right.\n   - The mission is to open the red door then the blue door.\n   - There is a red door at some position and a blue door at position (8, 4) (from the observation).\n   - The agent needs to move towards the doors. Since the agent is facing right, the first step to get closer to the doors is to move forward.\n2. Analyze the action options:\n   - We have the action space: turn_left, turn_right, move_forward, pickup, drop, toggle, done.\n   - To start moving towards the doors, the appropriate action is to move forward as the path in front of the agent is clear.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","1. First, analyze the current situation:\n   - The agent is at position \\((7, 1)\\) and is facing right.\n   - The mission is to open the red door then the blue door.\n   - From the grid, we need to find the positions of the red and blue doors. There is a door at \\((3, 2)\\) and \\((8, 4)\\) (assuming the object - type 4 represents doors). We assume the color information of these doors can be inferred further to be red and blue respectively.\n   - The agent is facing right, and to reach the first door (presumably the red one), it should move forward as there is no indication of an obstacle in the way.\n2. Then, choose the action according to the rules:\n   - Since the path in front of the agent is clear, and we need to move towards the doors, the optimal action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The agent is facing right and in front of it is a path that can lead to the red door. First, it needs to move forward to get closer to the door.\nAnswer: move_forward","First, let's analyze the situation. The agent is at (7, 1) facing right. To open the red door and then the blue door, we need to get to the doors. Looking at the grid, we see that there is a red door at some position and a blue door at (8, 4). Since the agent is facing right, the first step should be to move forward to start approaching the doors.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The agent is at (7, 1) facing right. In front of the agent (to the right) is an empty path. To start working towards opening the red and blue doors, the first step is to move forward to get closer to the doors.\nAnswer: move_forward","1. First, analyze the current situation:\n   - The agent is at position (7, 1) facing right.\n   - The mission is to open the red door then the blue door.\n   - We need to check the agent's view to see if there is a door in front. Looking at the grid, the cell in front of the agent (since it is facing right, the next cell is (8, 1)) has an object - type of 2 (WALL). So, we can't directly open a door by moving forward currently.\n   - We need to re - position the agent to face the doors. The red door and blue door are not in the immediate forward path. We first need to turn to face the doors.\n   - Since the agent is facing right and we need to face the doors which are likely below or in other directions, a good first step is to turn left to re - orient the agent.\n2.

The mission is to open the door.\nFrom the given grid, we can see that there is a door at (5, 4).\nSince the agent is facing up, it first needs to move to be in front of the door. To do this, it should turn right to face right, then move forward several times to reach the door.\nThe first step is to turn right so that it can start moving towards the door.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","First, the agent is at (3, 2) facing right. The mission is to open the door. Since the agent is already facing the direction where it might encounter the door (assuming the door is in front of it as it's facing right), and opening a door requires the 'toggle' action according to the rules.\n\nAnswer: toggle","The agent is facing right and there is no indication of the door being in front of the agent from the current data. But since the mission is to open the door, we first need to face the door. As we have no other information about the door's location relative to the agent's direction, we assume we need to move forward to potentially reach the door.\nAnswer: move_forward","1. First, understand the current situation:\n   - The agent is at position (4, 2) facing right.\n   - The mission is to open the door. We assume that the door is in front of the agent (since it's the most direct way to try opening a door when facing in a certain direction).\n   - The action required to open a door is the 'toggle' action according to the rules.\n2. Conclusion:\n   - Based on the above analysis, the optimal action is to 'toggle' the door.\n\nAnswer: toggle","1. First, understand the situation:\n   - The agent is at position \\((4, 2)\\) facing right.\n   - The mission is to open the door.\n   - We need to check the cell in front of the agent. Since the agent is facing right, we look at the cell \\((5, 2)\\).\n   - In the given 3D - array, the relevant part for the cell \\((5, 2)\\) shows that the object type is \\(2\\) (which is not a door). But we can see that at \\((5, 4)\\) there is an object of type \\(4\\) (a door).\n   - Since the agent is facing right, we need to first turn right so that it can face the direction of the door.\n2. Choose the action:\n   - According to the action space, the action to rotate 90° clockwise is `turn_right`.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","The agent is facing down and the door is likely in front of it. To open the door, the agent needs to use the 'toggle' action.\nAnswer: toggle","First, the agent's current position is (4, 2) and it is facing down. The mission is to open the door. Since there is no information indicating the location of the door relative to the agent's current facing direction, we assume that the agent needs to first find the door and then open it. However, in the context of the given grid, we don't clearly see the specific position of the door in a way that we can determine if the agent is already facing it. But according to the rules, we need to perform an action to interact with the door to open it. Since we assume the agent should try to interact with the door in the most straightforward way when the mission is to open the door, and the 'toggle' action is used to open doors or interact.\n\nAnswer: toggle","1. First, find the position of the agent and the door:\n   - The agent is at position \\((4, 2)\\) facing down.\n   - By looking at the grid, we can see that there is a door at \\((5, 4)\\) (assuming the `object_type` of 4 represents a door).\n   - The agent needs to move and face the door to open it.\n2. Analyze the current direction and the path to the door:\n   - The agent is facing down. To reach the door at \\((5, 4)\\), the agent first needs to move forward to get closer to the door's column and then turn right and move forward again to face the door.\n   - Since the agent is facing down, the first step is to move forward.\n3. Conclusion:\n   - The optimal first - step action is `move_forward`.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The agent is facing down and there is a door in front (in the cell (5, 4)). To open the door, the agent needs to use the 'toggle' action.\nAnswer: toggle","1. First, understand the current situation:\n   - The agent is at position (4, 3) and is facing down.\n   - The mission is to open the door. From the observation, the door is at position (5, 4).\n   - To open the door, the agent needs to be facing the door and then use the `toggle` action.\n   - Currently, the agent is not facing the door. So, the first step is to turn towards the door. Since the door is to the right of the agent's current facing direction (down), the agent should turn right.\n2. Output in the required format:\nAnswer: turn_right","The agent is facing left and there is a door in front of it. To open the door, the agent should perform the 'toggle' action.\nAnswer: toggle","The agent is facing left and there is a door in the direction it is facing. To open the door, the agent needs to use the 'toggle' action.\nAnswer: toggle","The agent is facing left and there is a door at (5, 4). To be able to interact with the door, the agent needs to turn right so that it faces the door.\nAnswer: turn_right","First, the agent is at (4, 3) facing up. The door is at (5, 4). Since the agent is facing up and needs to face the door, it should first turn right so that it can face the door, then it can use the 'toggle' action to open the door. The first step action here is to turn right.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","1. Analyze the situation:\n   - The agent is at position (4, 3) facing right. The mission is to open the door.\n   - In front of the agent (since it is facing right), we need to check the next - cell to see if it is a door.\n   - From the observation, the agent's position is in the cell with object - type 10 at (4, 3). The cell to the right of the agent (at (5, 3)) is just a normal cell according to the grid, but the cell at (5, 4) has an object - type 4 (which is a door).\n   - Since the agent is facing right and the door is below it, the agent first needs to turn right so that it faces the door.\n2. Determine the action:\n   - According to the action space, the action to rotate 90° clockwise is 'turn_right'.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","The agent is facing down and there is a door at (5, 4).
