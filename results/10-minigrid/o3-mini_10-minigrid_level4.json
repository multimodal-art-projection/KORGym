The straight path on row 3 from (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3) avoids the lava (which is in row 1 and row 2 at x=2). The optimal next step is to move forward from (1,3) in order to reach (2,3) on the way to the goal.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The agent is at (2,3) facing right. The green goal square is located at (3,3) and there is a clear floor cell between them.

Since we must issue exactly one action step at a time and our current optimal move is to step into the adjacent square (i.e., from (2,1) to (2,0)), the best next action is:\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the mission \"go to the purple door\" and the grid, the purple door appears to be the one at (3,0) (a door cell whose properties suggest it is purple). The agent is at (2,1) and must go to (3,0). The ideal route is to move downward then left. Since the agent is initially facing up, the first move is to reorient toward the downward direction. The simplest reorientation is to perform a turn (we will eventually need to turn twice but we only output one action at a time). Thus the optimal first action is to turn_right, which is one step toward eventually facing down. \n\nAnswer: turn_right","Based on the observation and reinterpretation of the cell data, we note that the agent is at (2,1) facing east. In the grid the numbers appear to be arranged as [color, state, object_type] so that door cells are identified by object_type=4. We then identify that the door with first value 3 is purple (since 3 corresponds to purple according to 0=red, 1=green, 2=blue, 3=purple, etc). Two door cells show a “3” in their first element: the door at (3,0) [record: [3,0,4]] and the door at (3,4) [record: [3,4,4]]. The closest purple door is at (3,0) because the Manhattan distance from (2,1) to (3,0) is 2. \n\nFollowing the shortest path rules, the optimal route is to move forward (from (2,1) facing east, which brings the agent to (3,1)) then turn left and move forward to (3,0). Since we are to produce exactly one action at a time, the next best step is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the grid layout the agent is located at (3,1) and can see a door directly above at (3,0). Since the mission is to reach (go to) the purple door and the best (shortest) route is to head straight upward, the agent should first rotate from facing right to facing up. \n\nAnswer: turn_left","The purple door must be reached. Based on our interpretation that doors whose first value equals 3 are purple, we see that one door is at (3,0). The agent, currently at (3,1) and facing up (toward decreasing y), is directly in front of that door. The optimal action is therefore to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The agent is at (3,1) facing up, and the door immediately in front at (3,0) is the purple door we need to reach. Following our rules and aiming for the shortest safe path, the optimal action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The purple door is the one we can most quickly reach from our current position. Our agent is at (3,1) and facing up. Looking at the grid, one of the door cells (which are marked by 4) is at (3,0). Based on the convention that colors are encoded (with purple corresponding to 3) and noticing that the door in column 3 is the natural candidate for “purple,” taking the shortest route, the agent should head straight ahead. \n\nTherefore, the optimal action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the mission “go to the purple door” and the fact that the agent is at (3,1) facing upward, the closest candidate door is the cell directly ahead at (3,0) (which is marked as a door in the grid). Even though its coded color appears as 0, by mission instruction we assume this door is the purple door that we must reach. Moving directly forward minimizes the path length while aligning with the safety rules. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","Since the purple door is exactly in front of you (at (3,0)) and you're already facing upward, the shortest and optimal step is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Given the mission “go to the purple door” and noting that the agent is at (3,1) facing up, we examine the cell directly ahead at (3,0).

Since the agent is already facing right, the very next optimal step is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the analysis, the shortest safe route from the agent’s starting position at (2,2) (facing right) to the green goal (located at (1,8) as the only goal cell with color green) is as follows. First, the agent needs to begin going downward by turning from facing right to facing down. Since the agent must always pick the immediate action from the available list, the optimal next move is to turn_right. \n\nAnswer: turn_right","Based on the grid layout and the mission (“avoid the lava and get to the green goal square”), the green goal square is located at (8,1) (since the goal is the only cell with object_type=8 and green=color 1). From the current position (2,2) facing down, the shortest, safe path is to head east then move up. The optimal first step is to reorient from facing down to facing east. With our available actions, the correct first move is to use \"turn_left\" (which rotates the agent 90° counter-clockwise from down to right\/east).\n\nAnswer: turn_left","The straightforward plan is to travel east along row 2 from (2,2) to (7,2) and then south to reach the goal at (7,7). Since the agent is already facing right (east) and the path from (2,2) to (7,2) is clear, the immediate optimal action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the grid layout and the mission (“avoid the lava and get to the green goal square”), we first locate the agent at (3,2) facing east. The goal is located at (7,7) and there is a row of lava at row 4 in columns 1–6. A safe, short route is to proceed east on row 2 until column 7 and then head south. Since the agent is already facing east and the cells ahead on row 2 appear clear, the optimal first action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the grid, the lava is located on row 4 in columns 1–6. The green goal (object 8) is at (7,7), so a safe route is to go right to column 7 first (staying above the lava) then move down. Since the agent is at (4,2) facing right, the immediate best move is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The optimal plan is to proceed along the shortest safe path. From the agent’s starting position at (5,2) facing right, the path to the green goal at (7,7) is to first move right to (6,2) then (7,2) and then turn downward to avoid the lava-filled row (row 4 in columns 1–6). Following that, moving down consecutively gets the agent to (7,7). Since only one action is required at a time and the agent is already facing right, the best next step is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The best next step is to move forward so that the agent steps from (6,2) to (7,2). This begins the route that avoids the lava barrier (which occupies row 4 in columns 1–6) by later moving down at column 7 toward the green goal at (7,7).\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The optimal first move is to reorient the agent downward. Since the agent starts at (7,2) facing right and the goal lies down at (7,7) with a safe path in column 7, the quickest route is to turn right (to face down) and then move forward along column 7.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","The agent is at (7,2) facing down, so moving forward will take it to (7,3) along the safe column. Since the lava is located in column 4 (in rows 1–6), the direct downward path from (7,2) to (7,7), which is presumably the green goal square, remains clear. Thus, the optimal next action is to simply move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The green goal is located at (7,7). Since the agent is at (7,3) and already facing down (toward increasing y), the safest and shortest path is to move directly downward along column 7. This avoids all the lava patches (which are on a different row) and gets the agent closer to the goal.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The agent is at (7,4) facing down, and the goal appears to be to the south at (7,7). There is a lava row in row 4 but it does not block the path because the agent is already to the right of it. Moving directly downward will follow the shortest safe path toward the goal. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the grid the agent is at position (7,5) facing down and the goal (green goal square) is at (7,7). The shortest, safest path is to move horizontally toward the right. Because the agent is facing down, the optimal first action is to rotate left (90° counter-clockwise) so it faces right and then it can move forward twice, avoiding any lava. \n\nAnswer: turn_left","Based on the grid, the goal appears at (7,7) while the agent is at (7,5) facing right. There is a band of lava (action code 9) along y = 4 from x = 1 to x = 6 – which is not in our direct path. The optimal route from the agent’s current position to the goal is to move downward. Since the agent is facing right (direction 0) and needs to face down (direction 1) before moving forward, the next optimal action is to use a turn_right to change the orientation.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","The agent is at (7,5) facing down and the green goal is located at (7,7). Since there is a safe, clear path directly downward (with (7,6) being free floor and no lava in that column below the lava row at y=4), the optimal shortest step is to go forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The green goal square is located immediately in front of the agent. The agent is at (7,6) facing down, and the cell (7,7) appears to be the goal square. Since the path is clear and there is no lava in between, the shortest safe move is to step forward. \n\nAnswer: move_forward"],"prompt":"\n    You are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a game board and rules.\n    Your task is:\n    - First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n    - Second, output the answer in the required format.

Since the agent is not carrying anything and the key is needed to later open a door (presumably found adjacent), moving forward (i.e. going upward from position (1,2) to (1,1)) is the optimal step.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The key (no pun intended) is to pick up the key first. The key appears to be located in the cell immediately below the agent at (1,2). However, the agent is currently facing up (direction 3) and must face down (direction 1) to move forward toward the key. Since a 180° turn is needed, the optimal strategy is to execute one turn action at a time. The next step, therefore, is to turn in one 90° direction (for example, a right turn) and then continue turning until facing down before moving forward.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","From the current state at (1,1) facing right, the only free neighboring cell is below at (1,2) (since (2,1) is blocked by a wall).

The mission requires first obtaining a key before interacting with the door. Although the key is not explicitly visible on the known cells, there are unknown regions (cells with -1) nearby. The optimal initial step is to move forward into the unknown territory (cell (1,2)), where the key may be located. This action aligns with seeking the key and following the shortest path.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","I'll choose the shortest action that reorients the agent to face the door. Since the agent is at (1,2) and the door is at (2,2) located to its right and the agent is facing down, the most effective next step is to turn left (which rotates the agent to face right). \n\nAnswer: turn_left","Based on the grid and mission, the next optimal step is to pick up the key. Although the grid does not explicitly show the key, the mission “use the key to open the door” implies that the key must be obtained before interacting with the door at (2,2). The key is assumed to be located somewhere accessible (for example, in the nearby floor cell at (1,1)). The agent is at (1,2) facing right and must reorient to move toward the key. To move upward from (1,2) (toward (1,1)), the agent should rotate left.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","The door you need to open is immediately below your current position at (1,2), but since you are facing up, you must first reorient toward the door. To begin turning your attention downward, the optimal first step is to rotate. \n\nAnswer: turn_left","Based on the grid and mission, the agent (currently at (1,2) facing left) needs to first pick up the key. Looking at the surroundings, a likely candidate for the key is in the adjacent cell above (at (1,1)). In order to move there, the agent must face up. Since the agent is facing left, the shortest turn to face up is to turn right. \n\nAnswer: turn_right","Based on the mission (“use the key to open the door and then get to the goal”) the agent must first obtain the key before interacting with the door. Although the key is not explicitly labeled in the grid, the immediately accessible floor cells are at (1,1) and (1,3). Since the agent is currently at (1,2) facing up (toward (1,1)), moving forward will position the agent to inspect (or possibly pick up) the key if it is there. Therefore, the optimal first action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the mission, the agent must first get the key. Although the grid does not explicitly mark the key cell (the key is expected to be on the floor), a reasonable inference is that the key is located in the cell immediately below the agent at (1,2). Since the agent is at (1,1) facing up, the shortest way to face downward (toward (1,2)) is to rotate 180°. The simplest first action is to start by turning right (with the understanding that a second turn_right will later point the agent downward).\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Based on the observation, the agent is at (1,1) facing right so that “move_forward” would attempt to step into (2,1) – which is a wall. We need to start exploring toward the key (which is required to open the door) and the only available free spaces lie off to the side. From (1,1) the safest and shortest step is to turn right so that the agent faces down toward (1,2), a free cell. \n\nAnswer: turn_right","Based on the mission (\"use the key to open the door and then get to the goal\") and the grid layout, the optimal initial step is to acquire the key. The agent is at (1,1) facing down (↓) and the adjacent cell in that direction (at (1,2)) is one of the free cells. We assume that this cell holds the key (since the agent is not carrying anything and the mission requires its use). Therefore, the immediate optimal action is to move forward into (1,2) so that the agent can then use the \"pickup\" command to collect the key on that cell.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The best next step is to face the door. Since the agent is at (1,2) and the door is at (2,2) (to its right) while the agent is facing down, the optimal action is to rotate 90° counter‐clockwise (turn_left) so the agent will face right toward the door.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","Based on the grid, the agent (located at (1,2) and facing right) is directly facing the door at (2,2). The mission tells us to “use the key to open the door” – normally that would require the key, but since no key is present in the observable grid the door must be a closed door that can be opened by interacting with it. Therefore, the immediate optimal action is to interact‐with (toggle) the door in front.\n\nAnswer: toggle","The agent faces the door immediately in front of it. Although the mission mentions using a key, there is no key present in the grid. Since the door is blocking the path and the agent is correctly oriented, the best move is to interact with (open) the door via the toggle action.\n\nAnswer: toggle","The door is immediately in front of the agent. Because the agent is facing right and the door is at (2,2), and since closed doors must be opened with a toggle, the optimal first action is to toggle the door.\n\nAnswer: toggle","The door is in the cell directly below the agent (at (2,2)) while the agent is currently at (1,2) facing right. To head toward the door (and eventually use the key and toggle it), the best immediate step is to rotate right so that the agent faces down.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","The door is at (2,2) (to the right of the agent at (1,2)) and the agent is facing down. To align with the door so that it can eventually toggle it, the best first action is to turn left (which rotates the agent 90° counter‐clockwise from down to right).\n\nAnswer: turn_left","The optimal next step is to acquire the key. The key lies immediately ahead to your right (cell (1,3)). Since you are already facing right, the best immediate action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The optimal step is to move east. Since the agent is at (2,2) facing right (east) and the cell ahead (at (3,2)) is free (floor), the next step is to move_forward toward the goal.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the grid and mission, the nearest step is to start navigating toward where the key is likely hidden. Since the agent is at (3,2) facing right (east) and the door (which will need to be toggled later with the key) lies to the west, the key must lie elsewhere (likely in the north region). Following the rule of choosing the shortest (and safe) path while preparing for key pickup, the best immediate action is to turn left in order to face north.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","The most direct step is to get the key, which is positioned at (3,1) – directly in front of the agent (at (3,2) facing up). Therefore, the optimal action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the grid, the walls surround the interior. The only free cell adjacent to the agent (currently at (3,1) facing up) is the one directly below at (3,2). In order to move toward the door\/key area (and eventually toward the goal at (3,3)), the agent needs to reorient from facing up to facing down. The first action is to change the agent’s facing to eventually move downwards. \n\nThus the optimal next move is to turn appropriately. One valid and simple option is to perform a single turn_right, beginning to adjust the agent’s orientation.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","The agent is at (3,1) facing right, and the only immediately free cell is below at (3,2). In order to start navigating toward the area where the key is presumed to be (so that it can later be used to open the door at (2,2) to reach the goal at (3,3)), the agent should first turn right (which makes it face downward) and then later move forward. Following the “shortest paths” principle, the optimal first action is to turn_right.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Based on the mission “use the key to open the door and then get to the goal” and the grid provided, the agent (located at (3,1) and facing down) must eventually secure the key before toggling the door. However, the immediate step is to take the shortest safe move. Since the cell directly ahead (cell (3,2)) is clear (it does not contain a wall, door, or lava), the optimal next action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the observation, the door (a “4”) is at cell (2,2) which lies immediately to the west of the agent at (3,2). Since the agent is currently facing down (south), turning right will align it to face west—the direction of the door that must be opened using the key. (Even though the key isn’t visible in the observation, the mission instruction tells us to use it, so the subsequent plan would involve acquiring the key and then approaching the door. For now, the optimal next action is to face the door.)\n\nAnswer: turn_right","The cell immediately in front of the agent (when facing left) is the door at (2,2), but we need the key first. The closest key is at (3,1), so the agent should first reorient upward. That is achieved by a \"turn_right\" (since turning right when facing left will point the agent upward). \n\nAnswer: turn_right","Based on the observation, the grid shows a wall boundary with a door at (2,2) and the goal at (3,3). The agent is at (3,2) and is facing up. Although the mission instructs using a key to open the door, there is no key visible in the observation. In order to reach the reachable goal in the shortest manner, the agent should reorient toward the goal. Since the agent is currently facing up (north) and the goal is to its right (east), the optimal step is to turn right so that a move forward will take the agent directly to the goal.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Based on the mission “use the key to open the door and then get to the goal” and the grid layout, the door occupies the cell at (2,2) while the goal is at (3,3). Although no key is visible on the floor (with key cells normally marked as 5), the mission text tells us we must first pick up a key before unlocking the door. Since our agent is currently located at (3,2) facing right—and note that moving straight (move_forward) would hit a wall at (4,2)—the very next step is to reorient so that the agent can begin moving toward the left side of the grid (where the door is) and eventually to the presumed key location.\n\nBecause the agent faces right (→) and needs to eventually go left, a rotation is required. One common way (and equally acceptable from a shortest‐path standpoint) is to start with a turn_left. (Later steps would include another turn_left to face left, then moving forward toward the key and door.)\n\nAnswer: turn_left","Based on the grid and mission details:\n• The agent is at (3,2) facing up.\n• The door (which needs to be opened using the key) is at (2,2), which is immediately to the left of the agent.\n• To face that door, the optimal first move is to turn left.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","The door is directly in front of the agent (at (2,2)) and because the mission requires opening the door with the key (and the door is presumed to be locked), the next optimal step is to interact with it. Since the agent is facing left toward the door, the proper action is to use \"toggle\".\n\nAnswer: toggle","Based on the mission, the door is immediately in front of the agent (at grid cell (2,2)). Although the mission instructs us to “use the key to open the door”, there is no key visible in the grid so our only immediate logical action is to interact with the door. Since the agent is already facing left toward the door, the optimal next move is to use the toggle action to open it.\n\nAnswer: toggle","I'll choose to search for the key first. Although the door is immediately to the left of the agent, the mission requires that the key is picked up before opening the door. In the observed grid the only non‐wall and non–door neighbor from the agent’s current position appears to be the cell above (3,1). (Recall that the agent starts at (3,2) facing left and is not carrying anything.) To head upward the agent (currently facing left) should turn right (since left→up with a 90° clockwise rotation). \n\nAnswer: turn_right","Based on the observation, the agent is at (3,2) facing up, and the cell directly in front—(3,1)—appears to contain the key that we need. To achieve the mission \"use the key to open the door and then get to the goal\", the first step is to pick up the key. Thus, the optimal action is to pick up the key.\n\nAnswer: pickup","Based on our observation the agent is at (3,2) facing up. The goal is at (3,3) (directly below the agent), but a door lies in the corridor between the key (which must be picked‐up before door interaction) and the goal. Although the grid does not explicitly show a key object, the mission tasks us to use the key to open the door before proceeding. In order to eventually access the key (which we assume lies in the other region) the agent must eventually approach the door (located at (2,2)). From (3,2) the door is to the left, but since the agent is not yet carrying the key, it should first adjust orientation to eventually reach the area where the key is (likely by moving toward the door after acquiring the key). \n\nBecause the agent is facing up and its intended route (to later approach the door) requires re‐orienting leftward, the optimal first action is to rotate. Therefore, for this move the best action is to turn left.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","Given the layout the agent is at (3,2) facing left. The cell immediately ahead is (2,2) and contains the door. Because the mission requires first using the key to open the door, and since the agent is already positioned in front of the door, having presumably obtained the matching key beforehand, the most direct next action is to interact with the door. According to the rules, a door must be toggled (while facing it) to open. Therefore, the optimal action is to use toggle.\n\nAnswer: toggle","The grid shows that the key is most likely in the cell above the agent at (3,1) (indicated by the unusual -1 value), while the door that needs opening is to the left at (2,2) and the goal is below at (3,3). Since our agent is at (3,2) facing left, its forward cell is (2,2) (the door). To reach the key first, the agent should reorient upward. Thus, the optimal first move is to turn right (from left to up) so that moving forward will take the agent to the key.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Based on the grid layout, the agent’s current region (column 3) only contains free floor cells with (3,2) holding the agent and (3,3) the goal. Although the mission mentions “use the key to open the door,” the door at (2,2) and any key are in an inaccessible area (separated by walls). The shortest (and safe) way to achieve the goal is to proceed directly to (3,3). However, the agent is facing upward while the goal lies directly to the south (downward). Therefore, the first step is to change orientation toward the goal. One optimal way (from facing up) is to perform a turn_right twice; however, since we can only output one action per response, the immediate next optimal action is to turn_right so that subsequent actions can be planned for moving toward the goal.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","From the grid, the door is at (2,2) and the goal is at (3,3). The agent is at (3,2) and facing right (→). Although the mission states to use the key to open the door, the key is not visible in the grid. Moreover, the goal is accessible if the agent goes downward without interacting with the door. Because the agent is facing right and must head down to reach the goal, the optimal action is to rotate (turn right) so that the agent faces down (↓). \n\nAnswer: turn_right","Based on the grid we see that the door (object value 4) is located immediately to the left of the agent’s position at (3,2) while the goal (object value 8) is immediately in front (at (3,3)). However, the mission instructs us to “use the key to open the door and then get to the goal.” Even though the key is not visible in the current cells, the proper sequence is to first go toward the door so that once we eventually obtain the key we can open it. Since the door is to the left of our current facing (down) position, we must reorient the agent: turning right from facing down will have the agent face west (the door’s direction). Therefore, the optimal action as our next move is to turn_right.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Based on the map the agent is at (3,2) facing left, and the cell immediately in front (at (2,2)) is a door. The mission indicates that the door must be opened using the key (and by the rules, a closed door is opened by using the toggle action when facing it). Even though there is no visible key in the grid, the optimal next step is to interact with the door that is directly ahead. Therefore, the best action is to toggle the door.\n\nAnswer: toggle","Based on the mission requirements (“use the key to open the door and then get to the goal”) and our current state (agent at (3,2) facing left with the door immediately ahead at (2,2) and no key in hand), the optimal plan is to avoid attempting to open the door prematurely. Instead, the agent must first locate and pick up the key. Given that the grid shows free\/open cells in the direction above the agent, the best immediate move is to start a detour toward where the key is likely located. Since the agent is facing left, the quickest way to reorient toward a path leading away from the locked door is to rotate so that it can begin moving upward. According to the action space, to change from facing left (direction 2) to facing upward (direction 3) the agent should use the \"turn_right\" action.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","The board shows the key is immediately accessible at (4,2). Since the agent starts at (3,2) facing up but needs to grab the key to open the door later, the shortest approach is to turn right (so that the agent faces (4,2)) and then move forward on the next step. \n\nAnswer: turn_right","Analyzing the grid:\n• The agent is at (3,2) facing right.\n• The mission requires picking up a key and then using it to open the door before reaching the goal.\n• The nearest key is placed immediately above the agent at (3,1) (its cell shows a pickup candidate – indicated by a “-1”).\n• Since the agent is facing right, to step into (3,1) the optimal next action is to turn_left (which makes the agent face up).\n\nThus, the first move is to turn_left.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","Based on the grid we see that the agent is at (3,2) facing up, but the door (which must be opened using the key) is located immediately to the agent’s left at (2,2). To interact with the door, the agent must first face it. Given the available action list and the requirement to follow the shortest path, the best move is to turn left so that the door is in front of the agent.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","The door is immediately in front of the agent (at (2,2)) and since the agent is already facing left, the optimal next step is to open the door. Even though the mission mentions a key, no key is available in the observation so the best action is to toggle the door.\n\nAnswer: toggle","Based on the grid we see that the door lies immediately to the left of the agent (at (2,2)). However, the goal is in the agent’s corridor at (3,3), one cell down from the agent’s current position. Since there is no visible key in the agent’s current accessible area (and since the door is not on the direct route to the goal), the shortest‐path strategy is to head directly to the goal. To do so, the agent should turn so that it faces downward (toward (3,3)). Because the agent is currently facing left, one 90° counter‐clockwise turn (turn_left) will make it face down. \n\nAnswer: turn_left","Based on the mission “use the key to open the door and then get to the goal,” the optimal strategy is first to pick up the key before interacting with the door. Although our complete plan would eventually require turning toward the key, the very first step from the current situation (agent at (3,2) facing down and not carrying anything) is to reorient so the agent can move to the key’s location. Assuming the key lies (for example) in the cell immediately “behind” the agent (at (3,1)), the agent must turn to face that direction. Since the agent is currently facing down (south) and needs to face up (north) to move toward (3,1), a single “turn_left” is a valid first move (knowing that subsequent actions such as another “turn_left” and then “move_forward” would complete the reorientation).\n\nAnswer: turn_left","The agent is at (3,2) facing left (i.e. toward cell (2,2)), where a door is located. However, the goal lies at (3,3) (one cell directly below the agent). To eventually reach the goal (after later picking up the key and toggling the door as required) the agent should steer toward the goal. With the current facing being left, the shortest way to reorient down (direction 1) is to turn left (since from facing left [2] a left turn yields down [1]). \n\nAnswer: turn_left","Based on the mission and what’s visible in the grid, the door lies to the left of the agent at (2,2) while the goal is further down at (3,3). Given that the mission requires first “using the key” and the agent isn’t holding anything, the most plausible interpretation is that the key is located immediately in front of the agent (at (3,1), since the agent at (3,2) is facing up). The optimal next step is to advance into that cell so the agent can pick up the key. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the grid layout and mission “use the key to open the door and then get to the goal,” it appears that the door (cell with a 4) lies between the agent and the goal. Since the agent is not carrying anything and is currently at (3,1) facing up—with the cell immediately ahead (2,1) being a wall (value 2) and the only accessible nearby open cell being (3,2) (with unknown content likely to be a key)—the optimal next step is to reorient the agent so it can move toward (3,2). In our action space, the only way to change heading is to turn. Since the agent is facing up and the cell to its right (3,2) is the likely candidate to hold the key, the agent should turn right.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","I'll choose the action \"move_forward\" because, starting from (3,1) facing right, advancing to (3,2) is the most direct step that leads toward the door at (2,2) (after a suitable turn) and ultimately to the goal. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the layout and mission “use the key to open the door and then get to the goal” we must follow a plan that uses only the allowed actions. In this configuration the agent (at (3, 1) facing right) cannot move forward because the cell in front is a wall. To begin, the agent should change its orientation so that it heads toward the cell in which we assume the key is located (in the lower free cell). Therefore, the next step is to rotate 90° clockwise (“turn_right”) so that the agent faces downward. \n\nAnswer: turn_right","Looking at the layout, we note the following:\n• The agent is at cell (3,1) facing downward.\n• The door (a type‐4 object) is located at (2,2) and must be opened (via a toggle after using its key).\n• The mission tells us to “use the key to open the door and then get to the goal.”\n• Although the grid “shows” walls (2) all around and a few “unknown” (–1) cells, the only candidate for a key (a type‐5 object) must be on one of these unknown floor cells.\n• Given that the unknown cell directly in front of the agent at (3,2) is the most accessible and may hide the key, the optimal immediate action is to advance toward that cell. Once there the agent can use the pickup action to grab the key.\nTherefore, following the rules (only using actions from the list and aiming for the shortest path) the next action should be to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Looking at the grid from the agent’s perspective, note that the agent is at (3,2) and is facing downward. The goal is immediately below at (3,3). Although the mission mentions a key and a door, the door is located at (2,2) (to the agent’s left) and no key is visible on the board. Since our instructions require us to follow the core rules (using the provided action list and taking the shortest safe path) and the direct way to the goal is available, the optimal action is to simply advance toward the goal.\n\nThus, since the agent is facing down and the goal is directly ahead, the best action is:\n\nmove_forward\n\nAnswer: move_forward"],"prompt":"\n    You are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a game board and rules.\n    Your task is:\n    - First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n    - Second, output the answer in the required format.

The only boxes on the grid are at (2,2) and (2,3). The one at (2,3) is immediately adjacent (to the west of our agent’s current position at (3,3)), so that is our target. However, our agent is currently facing right (east). To eventually move forward into the cell (2,3), the agent must turn to face west. The optimal turning sequence would be to turn left twice (or right twice), but since we output only the next single action, the next step is to turn left.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","The grey box is located one cell to the left of the agent at (2,3). Since the agent is facing up, the optimal first move is to turn left so that it faces west. Following that, moving forward will take it to the target.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","The grey box is directly in front of the agent at (3,3) when facing left because the cell at (2,3) contains a box. To reach the grey box along the shortest path, the agent should move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Here’s my reasoning:\nThe target is the grey box. Scanning the grid, we see a box (object type 7) at (2,3) which is the nearest candidate relative to the agent (located at (3,3) facing left). Since (2,3) is immediately to the left of the agent and the agent is already facing left, the optimal and shortest move is simply to advance one cell using move_forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Since the target (the grey box) is represented by a BOX (object type 7) located at (2,3) (which is directly above the agent’s current position at (3,3)), the shortest path is to move upward. However, the agent is currently facing left (west). To face upward (north), the agent should execute a 90° clockwise rotation.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","The nearest box is at (2,3) (one cell to the left of the agent at (3,3)). Since the agent is facing up, the optimal first move is to turn left so that it then faces the box. \n\nAnswer: turn_left","The agent is at (3,3) facing left. The grey box is located at (2,3) (as the cell at (2,3) contains a box). Since the agent is already facing left, a single move_forward will bring it directly to the grey box.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The closest grey box is at position (2,3). You are at (3,3) and already facing left (toward decreasing x). So the optimal move is to simply move_forward to reach that grey box.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Given the mission is to go to the grey box and noticing that there is a box (object_type 7) immediately to the left of the agent (at (2,3)) and the agent is already facing left, the optimal action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The grey box is located at (2,3), which is directly one step ahead of the agent since the agent is at (3,3) facing left. The optimal move to reach the grey box is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The grey box is located immediately to the left of the agent at (2,3). Since the agent is already facing left, the shortest and safest move is to step forward directly into the grey box.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The agent is at (3,3) facing left and the mission is to go to the grey box. Looking at the grid, the box objects (object code 7) appear toward the left. In particular, the cell immediately to the left of the agent at (2,3) contains a box. Since the agent is already facing left and this adjacent cell is the target, the shortest safe action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The agent is already facing left and the grey box (a box with value 7) is immediately to its left at coordinate (2,3). Since this is the shortest safe path to the target, the optimal action is to move_forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The grey box that is our destination is directly in front of our agent at (3,3) since the cell at (2,3) contains a box (code 7) and the agent, facing left, is immediately adjacent to it. Following the rule to take the shortest path, the optimal step is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The grey box is at (2,3) – directly to the left of the agent, who is facing left. The optimal move to approach the grey box is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Since the agent is at (3,3) facing left and the only nearby “box‐type” cells appear immediately in that direction (at grid cell (2,3)), the shortest safe route to the grey box is forward. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","We see that the only box on the board is a BOX (object 7) and the one directly in front of the agent is at cell (2,3). Since the mission is “go to the grey box” and there is no need to pick up keys or interact with obstacles—and because the agent is already facing left (toward cell (2,3))—the optimal (shortest) move is to do a move_forward to approach that box.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the observation and mission, the grey box is at (2,3) – immediately to the left of the agent, who is at (3,3) facing left. The shortest path is simply to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The agent is at (3, 3) facing left. Directly left of the agent is cell (2, 3) which contains the box (object type 7) that matches the mission description (\"grey box\"). The optimal move is to move forward into that cell.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The agent is at (3,3) and is already facing left. Checking the grid, we see that one of the cells directly in front of the agent to the left — at (2,3) — contains a box (indicated by the value 7, which corresponds to the box object). Since the mission is to “go to the grey box” and we assume that the box in that location is the grey box, the optimal (shortest) move is forward. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","The agent is currently at (3,3) and facing left, which means that moving forward will take it to cell (2,3). In the observation, cell (2,3) contains a box (indicated by a 7), and since the mission is to “go to the grey box,” this is our target. Therefore, the optimal move is to advance forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the grid, the agent is at (3,3) facing left. Looking at the cells adjacent in that direction, we see that one cell to the left is at (2,3) and contains a box (object type 7). Although the colors shown in the observation don’t explicitly match grey, the closest box is at (2,3) and is directly in the agent’s forward line. To take the shortest route to the box, the optimal move is to go forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The grey box appears directly ahead of the agent at (2,3) (one step to the left), and since the agent is already facing left, the optimal and shortest action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The grey box is located at (2,3) (with object type 7) and is one step directly ahead of the agent, who is at (3,3) facing left. Since we want the shortest path and the path is clear, the optimal move is to move_forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the grid, the agent is at (3,3) facing left. Looking straight ahead, the cell at (2,3) contains a box (object type 7) which we interpret as the grey box that is our target. With the agent already facing toward that cell, the optimal first action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the grid, the agent is at (3,3) facing left so the cell immediately in front is (2,3). That cell contains a box (object type 7) – our target \"grey box.\" The optimal action is to simply move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Since the grey box is the target and the agent is facing left with an adjacent box directly to its left (at cell (2,3)), the optimal shortest-path action is to move forward into that cell.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The grey box (box with object type 7) is located immediately to the left of the agent at (2,3). Since the agent is already facing left, the optimal move is to simply move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The target is to reach the grey box. Although the mission calls it “grey box,” the only box on the grid is at (2,3) (with the proper object indicator 7) and it is immediately to the left of the agent at (3,3). The agent is already facing left, so the shortest, safest, and most direct action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The grey box is located at (2,3) and the agent is at (3,3) facing left, so the optimal move is to step forward into the box's cell.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the grid setup, the agent is at cell (3,3) and is facing left (toward decreasing x). A box exists at (2,3) which is the closest candidate for the “grey box” mission target. Since the agent is already facing the target, the optimal, shortest path is to move forward one step.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Given that our agent is at (3,3) facing left and the mission is to “go to the grey box”, we must navigate by taking the shortest route. Looking at the grid, one box appears at (2,3) (the cell with value 7) and is immediately to the left of the agent. (Even though the printed “color” information is ambiguous, the only box objects are in the grid and (2,3) is the closest.) Since the agent is already facing left, the optimal action is to move forward, stepping into (2,3), where the grey box is assumed to be.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the observation, the agent is at (3,3) facing left. Directly in front of the agent is the cell at (2,3). That cell contains a box (object type 7), and by the mission (“go to the grey box”), it is the target. Since the agent is already facing that cell, the optimal and shortest action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the grid, the nearest box is at (2,3) (one step upward from the agent at (3,3)). Since the mission is to “go to the grey box” and we assume that among the available boxes the optimal target is the one reachable in one step (after an appropriate reorientation), the best path is to move directly upward. However, since the agent is facing left (toward decreasing y values) but needs to go up (decreasing x values), the agent must turn right to face up before moving forward. \n\nAnswer: turn_right","Based on the grid, the agent is at (3,3) facing up. The target grey box (object type 7) is located at (2,3), which is immediately to the left. Since the agent faces up, the optimal first action is to turn left so that it faces west toward the box.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","The grey box is one of the box cells. Looking at the grid layout interpreted as rows and columns, the two boxes (object type 7) appear in row 2 at columns 2 and 3. The target “grey box” is best reached by the box immediately above the agent. The agent is at row 3, column 3 and must go upward one step to row 2, column 3. However, the agent is facing left. Based on the directional encoding (0=right, 1=down, 2=left, 3=up), to face upward (3) from left (2) the agent should turn right (clockwise rotation). \n\nThus, the shortest and safest action is to rotate with a “turn_right” so that the next move_forward will bring the agent closer to the grey box.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Given the grid, we interpret the inner cells as floor (empty cells) except for special objects. The only objects of type BOX (represented by 7 in the grid) are located in row 2. In particular, the box at cell (3,2) (one step directly north of the agent at (3,3)) is the closest candidate. Since the mission is “go to the grey box” and the rules demand taking the shortest path, the optimal move is to move forward (the agent is currently facing up toward (3,2)). \n\nAnswer: move_forward","The grey box appears to be the target and judging by the grid its location is adjacent to the agent. The closest candidate is the box at (2,2). Since the agent is at (3,2) facing up, the optimal next move is to turn left so that the agent faces left (towards x‑coordinate 2) and then it can move forward to enter that box’s square.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","The box closest to the agent – which is the target – is directly to its left. Since the agent is at (3,2) and facing left, the optimal move (and shortest path) is to step into the cell (2,2) where the box is located. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","The grey box is located at (2, 2) and the agent is at (3, 2) facing left, so moving forward will take you directly to it.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The agent is at (3,2) facing left. The cell directly ahead at (2,2) contains a box (object type 7), and since boxes are typically grey, that is our grey box target. The optimal and shortest move is to simply move forward into (2,2).\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The grey box is in the cell immediately above the agent. Since the agent is facing left and must move upward, the optimal move is to turn right (which makes it face up) so that a subsequent forward movement will take it to the grey box.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Based on the grid, the target grey box occupies cell (2,2) (and extends down to (2,3)). The agent is currently at (3,2) facing up. The direct shortest route is to go one cell left. Since the agent is facing up, it must reorient by turning left (which makes it face west) and then move forward in the next step. For this first move the optimal action is to turn_left.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","The agent is at (3,2) facing left. One of the grey boxes is located at (2,2) (to the immediate left of the agent). Since the agent is already facing left and the target is one step ahead, the optimal (and shortest) move is to step forward toward the grey box.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The target is the grey box and from the grid we see a box at (2,2).

A shortest‐path route (avoiding obstacles and following rules for doors) is to first go north toward row 1 and then head east around the door at (5,1) (which must be toggled to pass), then turn and go down to reach (6,3) so that once there the agent can use pickup. Since the agent is at (3,2) and already facing up, the immediate optimal action is to move forward into (3,1).\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the board we see that our only box (object type 7) is located at (6,3) – our intended “red box” target. Although its color field appears as 3 (which would normally be purple), the mission tells us to pick up the red box, so we assume that is our only available box and the intended target. However, the door in column 5 (at (5,1)) blocks the direct passage on the row where the agent is located. The optimal (shortest) path is to open that door so the agent can cross over toward the box.

Therefore, the next step is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The red box appears to be the only BOX (object type 7) on the grid at coordinate (6,3). From the agent’s current position at (3,1) facing right, an optimal strategy is to approach it via the shortest path. The agent is already facing east so the immediate action is to step forward, moving from (3,1) to (4,1).\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the grid, the target (the red box) is at (7,0). The simplest route from our current position – (3,1) facing right – is to head east toward column 7 and then move north into row 0. In an ideal plan we would perform:\n1. move_forward four times (to go from (3,1) to (7,1)),\n2. turn_left to face north,\n3. move_forward (to go from (7,1) to (7,0)), and finally\n4. pickup to collect the red box.\n\nSince you must output exactly one of the allowed action words, the optimal immediate action is to head east from your current orientation. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the board layout and the obstacles in every other row, the only way to eventually get into row 1 (where there is a gap past the ball and door) is to go directly right. Even though the ball at (4,1) currently blocks the way, the optimal play is to move forward so you can then use pickup\/drop\/toggle actions as needed—clearing the ball (and later opening the door) to allow a straight path to the red box at (6,3).\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The red box is located at (7,0) – the only cell with object_type 7 and color 0 – while the agent is at (3,1) facing right. The shortest route is to move upward then east toward the red box and finally pickup it. To start, the agent should turn left so that it faces upward (north) and then move forward to get closer. \n\nAnswer: turn_left","We first analyze the grid. The mission is “pick up the red box.” In our game the only box (object type 7) appears at cell (6,3). Although color information isn’t explicitly shown in the grid printout, we conclude the target is the box at (6,3). To reach it from the agent’s current position at (3,1) facing up, one viable shortest route is to enter the door at (5,1) – note that the door (object 4) must be toggled before passing – then continue east and finally head down to (6,3) so you can “pickup” the box. Since we act one step at a time and the agent is facing up, the very first optimal move is to reorient to face east, which is done by a “turn_right.” \n\nAnswer: turn_right","We first analyze the grid. Notice that if the agent (at (3,1) facing right) were to move straight ahead, its forward cell (4,1) contains a ball (object code 6) which would block progress. Since our mission is to pick up the red box (object type 7) located at (6,3), the agent must avoid this immediate obstacle. The optimal way is to start rerouting by turning right (from facing right to facing down) so that the agent can move around the obstacle and then navigate toward the box along the shortest path.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Based on our analysis the red box is our pickup target. Although the grid shows only one box at (6,3) (with color value 3, which normally corresponds to purple), we must follow the mission “pick up the red box.” Given our available information and the rules in which only the provided action list may be used, we assume that the only box available is the one to be picked up. The shortest route from the agent’s starting position at (3,1) (facing down) to the (assumed) target at (6,3) is to head east along row 1 and then proceed south.\n\nSince the agent is facing down, the first step is to reorient so that it faces east. The allowed action to change orientation is “turn_left” (recall that when facing down, a left turn makes you face east).\n\nAnswer: turn_left","The target red box is at (6,3) and from the current position at (3,1) the shortest safe route is to go downward and then turn east. Because moving forward immediately would lead into a ball at (4,1), our first step is to reorient toward the free downward cell. Thus the optimal next action is to turn_right so the agent faces down.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","The only object that can be a candidate to pick up is the box seen at cell (6,3) because it carries the “7” code (which corresponds to a BOX). Although its color entry is “3” (purple), given that no other box appears in the grid, we infer that this is the target red box even though there is a slight discrepancy. In order to pick it up, the agent (located at (3,1) and facing down) must eventually navigate from the left “room” (cols 1–4) to the right “room” (cols 6–9) where the box lies. The only passage between these two areas is through the door at (5,1). The shortest route from (3,1) to (5,1) is to go east. However, the agent is currently facing down. To face east (right) when starting from a downward orientation, the correct immediate action is to turn left.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","Based on the grid we see that the agent’s direct forward cell (to its right) is occupied by an object (the ball) that is not the target red box. To eventually reach the red box (located at the only box cell on the board), the agent must circumnavigate the barrier. Following a shortest‐path policy and avoiding obstacle cells, the best immediate action from (3, 1) facing right is to change direction so that the agent can begin a route (for example, heading downward and then around the blocked row) toward an approach that will ultimately let it get adjacent to the box and then pickup the red box.\n\nThus the immediate optimal action is to turn right.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","We need to go from our current cell (3,1) facing down to the location of the red box. The red box is the only BOX (object type 7) on this board—located at (6,3). A shortest path, while avoiding obstacles, would be to head east (right) from (3,1), then down to (6,3). But since we are facing down (south), we must first reorient ourselves toward the east. According to our rules, turning counter‐clockwise (turn_left) when facing down will point us east. Thus, the optimal first step is to use “turn_left”.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","We analyze the grid and note that although our mission is “pick up the red box,” the only box on the board appears at (6,3). With the agent starting at (3,1) facing right, a direct route is along the agent’s forward (east) direction. However, note that the cell at (4,1) holds an object (a ball) and the next cell at (5,1) is a door that must be opened (using toggle) before passing. A concise plan is to step forward into (4,1) (without automatically picking up the ball), then toggle the door at (5,1) and move forward into (5,1) and then (6,1). From there the agent will turn to face down and proceed to (6,2) and finally to (6,3) where the (red) box is, and then use the pickup action.\n\nSince by default the agent must select the optimal single step and is already facing east, the first optimal action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on our analysis, the red box (object type 7 with red color) is located at (6,3) and the fastest route is to head toward that cell.

Therefore, the optimal first action is to turn right.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Based on the grid, the only box (object 7) is at (6,3) and it must be the red box (red is color 0). The agent is at (3,1) and needs to go around an obstacle – a closed door at (5,1) – that stands between the agent and a clear passage toward the box. The optimal plan is:\n1. At (3,1) facing down, turn left so the agent faces east.\n2. Move forward to (4,1) (there is a ball there but that cell is traversable).\n3. While facing east, toggle the door in (5,1) to open it.\n4. Move forward into (5,1) then (6,1).\n5. Turn right to face down.\n6. Move forward to (6,2) then into (6,3) (where the red box is) and issue pickup.\n\nSince you must reply with exactly one lowercase action word representing the next optimal step, the very first move is:\n\nAnswer: turn_left","I'll analyze the grid. The mission is to “pick up the red box.” In this grid the only box (object type 7) is at cell (6,3) – this is our target. The agent starts at (3,1) facing right. Note that there is a door (object type 4) in cell (5,1) that lies directly between the agent and the later part of the route. Since closed doors must be opened (using “toggle”) before passing, the shortest route is to go straight from (3,1) to (4,1), then toggle the door at (5,1) so it can be traversed. Then the agent continues forward into cell (6,1), turns downward (with a “turn_right” as facing right turning clockwise faces down), proceeds two steps down until arriving at (6,3), and finally uses “pickup” to collect the box.\n\nSince the action list requires a single action per response and the agent must follow the shortest immediate step, the optimal first action is to proceed from (3,1) into (4,1), i.e. move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The red box is the only box (object code 7) and is located at (6,3). However, the grid shows a vertical obstacle between the agent (at (3,1) facing right) and the box. The only passage from the left side to the right is at cell (5,1), which holds a door (object code 4) that needs to be toggled open. In a shortest‐path solution the agent should advance east from (3,1) to (4,1), then while still facing east use the “toggle” action to open the door at (5,1), then continue east and finally head south toward (6,3) to pick up the red box. With the agent already facing east, the very next optimal action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The plan is to reach the box (object code 7) located at (6,3). From the agent’s starting position at (3,1) facing right, the shortest route is to first head right into (4,1). Then, while still facing right, the agent will use toggle to open the door at (5,1), move into (5,1) and then (6,1). Next, turning right (to face downward) the agent will move forward twice to arrive at (6,3) (where the box is located) and finally execute pickup. Since only one action is to be output at each step and we need the next optimal move, the proper next action is to move_forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the current state the optimal first step is to advance along the agent’s current heading. Even though there is an object (the ball) in the adjacent cell, the optimal plan (assuming objects in non‐target cells may be bypassed later or moved if necessary) is to begin by moving forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","We first analyze the board. The grid is 11 columns by 6 rows; the borders (columns 0 and 10 and rows 0 and 5) are walls. The agent is located at (3,1) and is facing right. Looking at the inner cells, we identify that there is a door at (5,1) (noted by the “4” in that cell) that blocks passage from the left side (columns 1–4) to the right side (columns 6–9). The red box we must pick up (mission “pick up the red box”) is represented by a “7” and (since the red color is coded as 0) the only candidate is at (6,3).\n\nThe optimal plan is to pass through the only gap. From the starting cell (3,1) facing right the planned sequence is:\n1. move_forward from (3,1) to (4,1). (Though (4,1) holds another object—a ball—you want to avoid picking it up because it’s not your target.)\n2. While at (4,1) and still facing right the door at (5,1) is immediately in front.

Turn to face down (by using turn_right) so that the agent can go south.\n6. Move forward twice (from (6,1) to (6,2) then to (6,3)) to reach the red box.\n7. Finally, use pickup on (6,3) to collect the box.\n\nSince the action we must now take from the initial state at (3,1) facing right is to set this plan in motion, the first optimal action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the mission “pick up the red box” and the grid layout, the red box is visible at cell (6,3) (its “object‐type” value is 7, which denotes a box) while the agent is at (3,1) facing right. (Recall that the grid’s interior shows that cell (5,1) is occupied by a door and cell (4,1) by another object – a ball – which we do not wish to disturb because we must later pick up the red box.) In order to avoid the door‐cell and its side obstacles, the best route is not to head immediately east but instead to start by going “down” along the free cells. From (3,1) the Manhattan difference to (6,3) is (3 steps east, 2 steps south); although either initial “move_forward” (east) or “turn_right” then “move_forward” (south) would cut the total distance by one, the eastward cell (4,1) is occupied. (There is also a wall (or door) blocking the direct east–west passage later.) Therefore the first move should be to change direction from east to down – that is, issue “turn_right” to face south. (From there the plan is to progress downward, then reorient and cross the barrier via the door cell after toggling it if needed so as to eventually reach (6,3) and use “pickup.”)\n\nFollowing the required response format, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: turn_right","The red box is located at (6,3) while the agent is currently at (3,1) facing down. There is an obstacle wall (or door) in column 5 except at row 1. The optimal path is to go east along row 1 by turning to face right:\n1. From (3,1) (facing down), first turn left to face right.\n2. Then move forward into (4,1) (a ball is there but it’s passable).\n3. With the door in (5,1) ahead, use toggle to open it.\n4. Move forward into (5,1) (now open) and then into (6,1).\n5. Turn right so you face down.\n6. Move forward twice (through (6,2) then (6,3)) to reach the red box.\n7. Finally, use pickup to collect the red box.\n\nSince you are only required to choose the next optimal action, the best immediate step is to turn_left.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","The red box is located at (6,3) but the agent’s direct forward cell at (4,1) contains the ball. (In this grid world objects block movement.) Since the agent is facing east and cannot move into (4,1), the first step is to avoid that obstacle. Looking at the surroundings, the only free adjacent cell is below (in row 2). To head south the agent should execute a turn_right from its current east-facing position.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","The red box is located at (6,3) while you start at (3,1) facing down. A viable shortest path is to first go east to bypass a door at (5,1). In more detail, the optimal plan is that you turn left so you face east, then move forward to (4,1), use toggle to open the door at (5,1), then step through toward (6,1). Finally, turn right to go south and then move forward twice to arrive at (6,3) and pick up the red box. Since you must output one action at a time, the very first optimal action is to turn left.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","From the initial state (agent at (3,1) facing right), the optimal plan is to continue along row 1 toward the door that will let us reach the box. Because the best (shortest) route is along row 1 – even though there is a ball in cell (4,1) (which we are not meant to pick up because the mission is “pick up the red box”) – the intended interpretation is that these items do not prevent movement. In that case the very first optimal action is to move forward into cell (4,1).\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the mission “pick up the red box” and the layout we can deduce that the only box in the grid is at position (6,3). In order to eventually pick up that object the agent must first clear the obstacles between its current location at (3,1) (facing right) and the box. One likely plan is to reach the door between columns 4–6 on row 1 (which, once toggled open, will let the agent traverse the corridor toward x‐positions beyond the ball at (4,1)). However, because the direct eastward path is blocked by a ball and then a closed door, the very first step is to begin rerouting. A safe and promising first action is to “turn_right” so that the agent can reorient (for example, toward the south) and work around the ball and door in order to eventually reach a cell (such as (6,1)) from which the door can be toggled.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","I analyze the board as follows. The mission is “pick up the red box” so our target is the box (object type 7) with the red color. Scanning the grid, the only box is found in cell (6,3). However, a wall (object 2) occupies cell (5,3) and a door (object 4) blocks direct horizontal passage in row 1. In fact, the only passage from the agent’s start in the left region into the room where cell (6,3) is located is via the door at (5,1). But the door is not immediately accessible from our side because a ball (object 6) sits in cell (4,1). To clear a way to the door so we can eventually cross over and reach the box, the optimal plan is to first “clear” cell (4,1) by picking up the ball and then toggle the door. (Once the door is open, we will later drop the ball so that our inventory is empty before picking up the red box.) \n\nStarting at (3,1) facing down, the very first step is to reorient so that we can head east toward cell (4,1) where the ball is. Since the agent is currently facing down, turning left will have it face east.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","Based on the grid’s layout and our objective (“pick up the red box”), the only box (object code 7) is located at cell (6,3). Although there are several objects (the ball at (4,1) and the key at (4,2)) blocking the most direct eastward path from our start at (3,1) (facing east), the optimal plan is to begin rerouting around these obstacles. A promising initial step is to change direction so that we can bypass the ball in (4,1). From our start, turning right so that we face south lets us head downward (into clear floor cells) and then later try to maneuver east to eventually approach the red box from an accessible side.\n\nThus, the optimal immediate action is to perform a single “turn_right.”\n\nAnswer: turn_right","At the start the agent is at (3,1) facing down. Our goal is to pick up the red box which is the only box in the free area – it’s located at (6,3). Observing the layout, the shortest route is to head right (east) along row 1, open the door at (5,1) so as to reach column 6, then turn south to reach row 3 where the box is. Since the agent is currently facing down, the very first step is to turn_left so that it faces east before it can move toward the door and then the box.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","Based on the observation and mission (“pick up the red box”) the only red box available is the box (object type 7) at (6,3). The agent begins at (3,1) facing right. A shortest‐path approach that avoids passing through cells with other objects (like the ball at (4,1) and the door at (5,1)) is to not move straight ahead. Instead, the agent should change direction to bypass the ball and eventually reach an appropriate adjacent cell from which to pick up the red box. For a first step the optimal action is to turn right (rotating 90° clockwise from the current facing right to face down) so that the agent can begin a detour around those obstacles.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","The target (the red box) is not directly accessible because a ball is currently occupying the cell between the agent and the door that leads into the east‐area where the box is located. To later open the door (via a toggle) the agent must first free the path by removing the ball at (4,1). Since the agent starts at (3,1) facing down (i.e. toward increasing y values), the immediate step is to reorient so the ball to the east (at (4,1)) becomes reachable. Therefore, the optimal first action is to turn left (which when facing down will point the agent east). \n\nAnswer: turn_left","The red box is at (6,3) (since the only box cell with a 7 is there) and the agent is at (3,1) facing right. Although several routes exist, note that between (3,1) and (6,3) there is a door at (5,1) (represented by a 4) that is currently closed. The optimal plan is to first head toward that door and toggle it open so you can then pass. From (3,1) facing right the first step is to move forward into (4,1) (even if that cell contains another object, it is passable), allowing you then to toggle the door at (5,1).\n\nThus, the very next optimal action is to move_forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The optimal next action is to move forward so that the agent can start progressing east toward the door and eventually toward the red box.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the grid, the only box present is at (6,3) – the only candidate for the red box. Using shortest path reasoning, the agent at (3,1) should avoid any potential obstacles (like the ball at (4,1)) and first head downward to later approach from the left. The planned route is:\n\n• From (3,1) facing right, turn right to face down.\n• Then move_forward twice to reach (3,3).\n• Then turn_left to face right and move_forward three times to enter (6,3) where the box is.\n• Finally, use pickup to pick up the box.\n\nSince we respond with one action at a time, the optimal first step is to reorient downward.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","We want to pick up the red box. The only box (object type 7) is at position (6,3) and we know it is the red box by the mission description. Our agent is at (3,1) facing down. The shortest path is to first move south (down) then east – for example, move forward twice to go from (3,1) to (3,3), then turn right to face east, move forward three times to reach (6,3), and finally “pickup” the box. Since we output one action per turn and the agent is already facing the correct direction to start moving south, the optimal first action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The red box is our target and it is at (6,3) (because the only BOX [object type 7] in the grid is at that position).

That door is our only possible “gateway” from the left side (where our agent is at (3,2)) into the region containing the box. To use the door at (5,1) we must first approach it from above, meaning we must go north from (3,2).\n\nThe agent starts at (3,2) facing down (direction 1). To head north (direction 3) we must change direction by two 90° turns. An optimal two-turn plan is, for example, to turn_left twice. Since we are allowed to output only one action at a time, the best immediate action is to start turning. Therefore, the optimal next move is:\n\nAnswer: turn_left","The board shows that the red box (object 7) is located in the right‐side region (at (6,3)), but that region is isolated from the agent’s starting area by a wall “column” (cells with value 2) except for a single door at (5,1). Unfortunately the door can only be toggled (opened) if its adjacent left cell is clear—but (4,1) currently holds an interfering object (a ball). In order to eventually cross north–east into the right region and pick up the red box, the agent must first clear that blockage.\n\nA shortest‐path plan is to go from the agent’s start at (3,2) to (4,1) to remove the ball (using “pickup” and “drop” if necessary) so that the door at (5,1) can then be toggled and used as the only passage to the right region. Since the agent is initially at (3,2) facing right, the very next step is to head upward (north) toward row 1. \n\nThus the optimal first action is to rotate left (turn_left) so that the agent faces upward.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","Based on our analysis the red box (object type 7) is located at (6, 3) and the agent is at (3, 2) facing up.

To avoid the wall column, the optimal plan is to go upward into row 1 (where the door is located) and then cross over to the right block before descending to (6,3) to pick up the box.\n\nSince the agent is initially facing right but must go upward (toward row 1), the first action is to turn left (which rotates the agent from right to up).\n\nAnswer: turn_left","The red box is at cell (6,3) and the agent is at (3,2) facing north.

Because the only gap from our left‐side “region” into the right‐side region (where the red box lives) is via the door cell at (5,1) and that passage is blocked by the ball at (4,1) when coming directly from the start, the safest immediate step is to avoid going straight east. In our analysis the “optimal” first action is therefore to change direction so as to begin an alternate route around the ball.\n\nThus the first valid action is to rotate right (so the agent faces down) in order to try a detour that avoids the blocking object.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","The red box appears to be the only box on the board – at (6,3). Starting at (3,1) and facing down, the quickest route to (6,3) from here is to head east first.

The agent starts at (3,1) facing right. Using the rule to take the shortest safe path and using only the provided actions, the most direct initial move is to continue in the current direction (east) toward where the target lies.

The grid is split into two regions by an impassable “wall” column except for a door cell at (5,1). Our red box is found at (6,3) on the right‐side region. To reach it, the agent must open the door. To do that, the agent must first get adjacent to the door.

To reach (6, 3) via one of the shortest paths, the agent should head roughly to the east and then toward the south. However, note that moving straight ahead from (3, 1) (i.e. to (4, 1)) would land on a cell containing a BALL (code 6) and then the next cell (5, 1) is a DOOR (code 4) whose state isn’t given—opening it might require a toggle. An alternative is to go south first. From the current east-facing orientation, turning right will make the agent face south. Then a move_forward will take the agent from (3, 1) down to (3, 2), and subsequent actions can steer the agent eastward to (6, 3).

With the agent at (3,2) facing up and the cell directly ahead (3,1) being clear (indicated by –1 which represents a floor cell), the next optimal step is to move forward to explore further.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the grid the red box (object type 7) appears to reside at (6,3) behind a wall‐column in column 5. The only way into that area is to take the door at (5,1), which is currently blocking a direct path from the agent’s start at (3,1). Using the shortest route, the agent should first head east toward that door. Since the agent is facing up, the optimal first action is to turn right so that it faces east.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Based on the mission “pick up the red box” we must bring our attention to locating the red box in the grid. In this grid configuration the only box appears at cell (6,3) (its object id is 7). Since “red” refers to the required color but we have no conflicting colored box present, this (6,3) box is our target.\n\nThe agent is at (3,1) facing right. However, note that cell (4,1) contains another object (a ball) that might block direct forward movement. To avoid intervening objects and to start making progress toward (6,3), the agent should adjust its direction so it can safely plan a short detour (for instance, moving downward first) and then circle toward the box.\n\nThus, the optimal first step is to reorient: since the agent is facing right, a right turn will point it downward, putting it on a path to eventually reach the target.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Based on the grid layout and our need to eventually pick up the red box (which is the only box on the board at (6,3)), we want a short path that avoids obstacles such as the door, ball, key, and walls. In this grid the obstacles block the more direct routes. A safe starting maneuver is to advance from the current cell toward open floor.\n\nThe agent is currently at (3,1) facing down (south), and the cell immediately in front (at (3,2)) is free. Thus the optimal first move is to step forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","From the analysis, the best plan is to go around the wall blocking the direct eastward route. One promising route is to head upward first so we can stand left of the door blocking access to column6. That way we can toggle the door and then advance to (6,3) where the red box is located. At the start the agent is at (3,2) facing down. To go upward (toward (3,1)) it must change its orientation. The optimal first move is to turn so that the agent faces upward. One way to do that is to turn right (from down, a right turn makes the agent face left; then another right turn would face up—but since we can only output one action now, the very next optimal action is to begin re-orienting by turning right).\n\nAnswer: turn_right","The target object is the red box. Scanning the grid, we see that the only box (object type 7) is at cell (6,3). Starting at (3,2) and facing left, one optimal strategy is to first start moving toward the target. Moving south first (by turning left from west) is an efficient choice since it minimizes extra turns later. Thus, the next optimal action is to turn_left.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","The red box is located at (6,3), and from our starting point at (3,2) (facing down) the optimal first step is to turn to the east. Facing down, turning left will orient the agent eastward so it can start moving toward the red box.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","Based on the grid layout and the mission “pick up the red box” (which is the only box present, located at (6,3)), we first need to plan a shortest route from the agent’s current position (3,2) facing right. Reviewing the grid shows that going straight right from (3,2) is blocked by a wall in column 5, so an alternate route is needed. One good plan is to head upward first: turn to face up and move one cell to (3,1). Then, turning right (to face east), the agent can move into (4,1) and then face the door at (5,1) that needs toggling before proceeding. After toggling and moving through the door, the agent can advance into the open corridor and eventually descend to reach the box at (6,3) and then execute the pickup action. \n\nFollowing the rule of always taking the shortest path, the very next optimal action from the starting state is to reorient upward.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","Based on our observation, the only box in the grid is located at (6,3). Since the mission requires picking up the red box and the only box available is there, the agent must navigate toward that cell. The agent starts at (3,2) and is facing up. The shortest path toward cell (6,3) lies generally to the east. With the agent currently facing up (north), the first step is to turn right so that it is facing east. This complies with using the provided action list and heading the right direction for the shortest path.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","The red box is the only box (object type 7) on the grid, and it is located at (6,3). Starting from the agent’s current position (3,2) facing east, the straight‐east path is blocked (the cell at (5,2) is a wall). An alternative route is to move north then east. From (3,2) the first step is to head north (since the agent is facing east, turning left will face north) in order to eventually bypass obstacles and approach the red box from above. \n\nAnswer: turn_left","The only box on the grid is the one at (6,3) (cell [6,3,7]), and while its color seems to be purple according to the observation, we follow the mission instruction “pick up the red box.” In our grid world the only pickup‐able box is that one. The agent is at (3,2) facing up and must take the shortest path toward (6,3). The optimal first step is to orient toward the target. Since the agent is facing up, turning right will make it face east (toward increasing x coordinates). \n\nAnswer: turn_right","Based on our analysis the only box on the board (object type 7) that can be picked up is the one located where the red‐box is expected. From the observation the red box appears at cell (7,0) (its second element is 0 meaning “red”) even though the only cell with a box (a 7 in the tile field) is in that column. The agent is at (3,2) and is facing east. Since the target lies to the northeast (roughly 4 cells east and 2 cells north), the first step along a minimal‐turn, shortest–path route is to reorient toward north. Therefore, the best immediate action is to turn left.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","Based on the grid layout and mappings, each column corresponds to a specific object type. In our mapping (object types 1–10) the box is represented by the value 7. In the observation the column with first element 7 (column 7) contains the box. In particular, the cell at (7,0) has [7,0,2] meaning it is a red box (color value 0). The agent is at (3,2) facing up. To head toward the red box, the shortest initial step is to move upward from (3,2) to (3,1) (decreasing the y‐coordinate). This move continues a shortest path strategy toward (7,0). \n\nAnswer: move_forward","The red box appears to be the only box on the board (object code 7, here at cell (6,3)). Although there are other objects (a ball at (4,1), a key at (4,2), and a door at (5,1)), the most straightforward route to eventually reach the box is to cross the door that is in the barrier. The optimal plan is to go in the eastward direction from our starting point (3,1) so we can eventually open the door, go into the corridor, and then approach the cell (6,3) from a direction that allows using pickup.\n\nAt (3,1) the agent is facing up. To start moving east (toward (4,1), which contains the ball but does not force pickup unless we issue that command) our very first action is to turn right.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Given the mission “pick up the red box” and noting that the only box on the grid is at (6,3), we need a shortest safe path from our current position at (3,1) facing right (east) to the box. A viable plan is to avoid the door seen along row 1 by moving “down” first then going east. In particular, the following sequence uses exactly 9 moves:\n\n1. turn_right (agent now faces south)\n2. move_forward (move from (3,1) to (3,2))\n3. turn_left (now facing east)\n4. move_forward (step to (4,2))\n5. move_forward (step to (5,2))\n6. move_forward (step to (6,2))\n7. turn_right (now facing south)\n8. move_forward (step to (6,3), where the box is)\n9. pickup (pick up the red box)\n\nSince you must output exactly one action (the immediate next optimal action) from the defined action set, and given that we are at (3,1) facing east, the first step is to head south by turning right.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","The red box is located at (6,3) (cell value 7 corresponds to BOX). The agent is at (3,1) and facing down. The most direct route is to go downward two cells (from (3,1) to (3,2) then to (3,3)), then turn left (from facing down to facing right) and move forward three times to reach (6,3), where the red box lies. With 8 moves remaining, our very next optimal action is to move_forward to begin our route.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The red box (object code 7) appears at (6,3), but there is a wall blocking a direct eastward move along row 2. A reasonable shortcut is to start by moving downward from the agent’s current position (3,2) since the cell at (3,3) is clear. This step also begins a longer detour toward approaching (6,3) from above or below a wall‐obstructed row.\n\nThus, the optimal first action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The red box (object type 7 with red color 0) is at cell (7, 0). The agent is at (3, 3) facing down. To approach the red box along the optimal (shortest) path, the agent should first reorient itself toward the east. Since facing down (direction 1), turning left (90° counter-clockwise) will face the agent east (direction 0), which is the first step toward reaching (7, 0).\n\nAnswer: turn_left","The board shows that the only red box (object type 7) is at (6,3) while the agent is at (3,3) facing right. However, a wall blocks the direct eastward path (there’s a wall at (5,3)), so the agent must find an alternate short route. In the optimal solution the agent needs to cross over to the right‐side region through the only “gap” – the door at (5,1) (which must be toggled open) – and then approach the box from above (entering at (6,3) from (6,2)). In order to start following this computed path we must begin with the first action. Being located at (3,3) and facing right, the optimal first step is to step forward into (4,3). \n\nAnswer: move_forward","Given that the red box (object 7) seems to be located past the wall, the optimal detour is needed. From the current position at (4,3) facing right, the cell immediately in front ((5,3)) is a wall so moving forward is not allowed. A promising plan is to detour by heading upward to eventually go around the wall (e.g. toward the door at (5,1) that may open a corridor to the box at (6,3)). With the agent facing right, the first action should be to turn left (to face up) so that the planned detour can begin.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","We'll analyze the board: The mission is “pick up the red box.” In the grid the only box (object value 7) is at cell (6,3). The agent is at (4,3), facing up. Because there is a wall blocking the direct horizontal path, the agent must take a detour. By examining the inner cells, we see that the passage from our side (cols 1–4) to the box’s side (cols 6–9) is closed by a wall in column 5 except for the door at (5,1). A possible shortest route is to go upward from (4,3) to (4,2) and then to (4,1), then head east into the door cell at (5,1) (which would require a toggle to open later) and then proceed to the box at (6,3). Given that only three moves remain, the immediate optimal step is to begin moving along that route.\n\nThus, the best action now is to move forward (from (4,3) to (4,2)).\n\nAnswer: move_forward","I'll move one step forward toward the red box by advancing in the agent's current direction (up). This is the first step along the shortest route toward the target.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The red box is our target item. Scanning the grid, we see that there is a box (object type 7) at cell (6, 3) – although its color is listed as 3 (purple), given the mission we assume it is the red box we must pick up. The agent is currently at (4, 3) facing up, and to follow the shortest route toward the box we need to turn so that we head east. Since the agent is facing up, the optimal choice is to turn right in order to face east toward (6, 3).\n\nAnswer: turn_right"],"prompt":"\n    You are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a game board and rules.\n    Your task is:\n    - First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n    - Second, output the answer in the required format.

Although the mission mentions “use the key,” the only interactable object visible in the observation (apart from the goal at (6,6)) is the door at (5,1). To follow the shortest path and approach the door (which will later be toggled when in position), the optimal initial action is to advance.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the mission and the grid layout, the optimal next step is to advance (move_forward) so that the agent can approach the door (which lies in its path) after it obtains the necessary key. (Note: Although the mission says “use the key to open the door,” the grid shows a door to the right and no key immediately visible. In a complete plan the key would be located by exploring nearby cells; however, following the shortest‐path logic starting at (3,1) facing right, the next action is to move_forward.) \n\nAnswer: move_forward","Since the agent is at (4,1) facing right and the door is immediately in front at (5,1), the shortest and optimal course is to act on the closed door by using the toggle action. This action will open the door, allowing passage, which aligns with the mission of using the key (if needed) to open the door and then reaching the goal.\n\nAnswer: toggle","The agent is currently facing right. Directly ahead (at (5,1)) is a door. Because the mission states that we must “use the key to open the door” and we are not holding any key yet, the agent must not interact with the door immediately. Instead, a quick survey is needed to locate the key. Observing that moving upward (if turned left) leads to a wall at (4,0), the shortest unobstructed path is to turn right (facing down) and then move forward to explore the unknown cells for the key. \n\nAnswer: turn_right","The door is located at (5,1), which is to the right of the agent’s current position (4,1). However, the agent is facing down. To approach and interact with the door (remember, closed doors require a toggle), the agent should first rotate to face it. Since the door is to the right relative to a down-facing agent, a single \"turn_left\" will rotate the agent from facing down to facing right, aligning it with the door.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","Given the mission “use the key to open the door and then get to the goal” and knowing that our agent is at (4,1) facing right with the door immediately in front at (5,1), we need first to open the door before heading toward the goal (at (6,6)). Although the mission “mentions the key,” the key is not visible in the observation – so we assume that the door is in a closed state that needs “toggle” (rather than a locked door that would require a key pickup). With the agent already facing the door, the optimal action is to interact with it immediately.\n\nAnswer: toggle","We note that the agent is at (4,1) facing right so that the cell immediately in front of it – cell (5,1) – contains a door.

Although the grid does not show a key, the closest actionable step is to open the door that is directly ahead. Therefore, the optimal action here is to use “toggle.”\n\nAnswer: toggle","Based on the mission, the agent must first find the key before interacting with the door. Currently the agent is at (4,1) facing right, with the door immediately ahead at (5,1). Since the door is locked and cannot be opened without first obtaining the key, the optimal strategy is to leave the door and explore an adjacent unknown cell where the key may be located. The cell to the right is occupied by the door and the cell upward (at (4,0)) is a wall (borders in this grid are walls). The cells to the left (at (3,1)) and downward (at (4,2)) are unexplored (indicated by -1). To follow a shortest-path strategy, the agent can quickly change direction toward one of these unknowns.\n\nSince the agent is facing right, turning right will make it face down and then a move_forward would take it into (4,2). Hence, the immediate optimal action to start exploring for the key is to turn right.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Based on the mission, we must eventually use a key to open the door. Reviewing the grid, the agent is at (4,1) facing down. Although the door appears immediately to the agent’s right (at (5,1)), we are not carrying a key and the visible cells do not show a key nearby. Therefore, to follow the shortest‐path strategy while avoiding actions that would try to toggle a locked door without a key, the agent should move forward (into cell (4,2)) to explore for the key.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the observation, the door is at (5,1) and the goal at (6,6), while the agent is at (4,2) facing down. Although the mission calls for using the key to open the door, no key is directly visible in the grid (all free floor cells show –1), so we will assume that the intended route is to go toward the door first. The shortest path from (4,2) to (5,1) is to go north from (4,2) (to (4,1)) and then east (to (5,1)). Since the agent is currently facing down, we must change orientation to face north.

Since the agent is already facing right and the first move toward the key is to go from (1,1) to (1,2), the best action now is to move_forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","We first analyze the observation. The grid is 5×5 with walls along the outer border (cells with value 2), and the walkable floor is represented by cells showing –1. The mission is \"use the key to open the door and then get to the goal\". Based on the grid interpretation:\n\n• The agent is at (1,1) and is facing right (east).\n• A key is located at (1,3). (The cell [1,3] holds the key as indicated by the value 5 in the third position of that cell.)\n• The door is at (2,2) and the goal is at (3,3).\n\nGiven the optimal strategy is to first pick up the key, the minimal path from (1,1) to the key is to advance rightwards along row 1: from (1,1) to (1,2) and then to (1,3). Since the agent is already facing right, the immediate correct action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the board, the key is at (1,3) and the agent (at (1,1) facing right) must first pick it up. The optimal first move is to change the agent’s heading from right to down so that he can advance toward (1,3). That is accomplished by turning right. \n\nAnswer: turn_right","To start you need to collect the key at (1,3).

Since the mission requires picking up the key first before toggling (opening) the door, the best short‐term step is to orient toward the key. The agent, currently at (1,2) and facing down (south), must face east to head toward (1,3) where the key is. To do that from facing down, the optimal action is to turn left (which rotates the agent from down to east).\n\nAnswer: turn_left","The key is located at (1,3), which is directly below the agent at (1,2). Since the agent is facing right (east), it must turn to face down (south).

We assume the key is located at (1,1) (the only open floor cell reachable from the agent’s start), so the first step is to re‐orient the agent from facing down so that it can move upward (toward (1,1)). To change from facing down to facing up requires two 90° turns. (It doesn’t matter whether you use two turn_left commands or two turn_right commands; here we choose turn_right twice.) Thus, the very first (immediate) action should be:\n\nturn_right\n\nAnswer: turn_right","The door you must open is one cell to your right. However, you are facing left. Following the rule of choosing the shortest path and using only the allowed actions, your first step is to reorient yourself so you face east (right). The simplest move is to turn right twice; however, since you must only output one action at a time, the optimal next action is to begin with a turn. \n\nAnswer: turn_right","Based on the mission “use the key to open the door and then get to the goal” and the grid layout—with the agent starting at (1,2) facing upward and the door clearly located one cell to the right at (2,2)—it appears that the key must be obtained before attempting the door. Examining the surroundings (the cell immediately ahead when facing upward, i.e. at (1,1)) the plan is to first go toward that cell to pick up the key. Since the agent is already facing up, the shortest and safest move is to step forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The key is located at (1,2) which is directly below you at (1,1). However, you are currently facing up so you need to reorient toward down before moving forward to pick up the key. Following the rules and aiming for the shortest path, your next optimal action is to turn right (and then you can continue turning right or moving forward in subsequent steps).\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Based on the grid and mission, the agent seems to be facing toward a cell that likely holds the key. To follow the shortest path to obtain the key before opening the door, the best immediate action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The key is most likely in the cell immediately in front of the agent (cell (1,2)), so the optimal first step is to move forward toward that cell. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the grid layout the agent is surrounded by walls except for the free cells at (1,2) and (3,1)\/(3,2) and so on. The door (object code 4) sits at (2,2) and the goal (object code 8) is at (3,3). Even though the mission states “use the key,” no key (object code 5) is visible in the grid. Given the current position (1,1) facing right (east), moving forward would hit the wall at (2,1). The best first step is to change direction so that the agent can go to the free cell below at (1,2) and then move to the door. Therefore, the optimal first action is to turn right (which, when facing east, makes the agent face south).\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Based on the mission \"use the key to open the door and then get to the goal\" and looking at the grid, the door is visible at (2,2) and the goal at (3,3) while the agent is at (1,1) facing down. Since the agent is not carrying anything and the key must be picked up before interacting with the door, the agent should first move forward into the cell immediately in front of it (which is (1,2)) where the key is likely located. Following the core rules and using the shortest path, the next action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Since the mission requires picking up the key first—and assuming the key lies in the adjacent cell above (at (1,1))—our optimal immediate move is to reorient from facing down to face upward. Because the agent is currently facing down (direction 1) and must face up (direction 3) in order to head toward the suspected key location, the shortest rotation is two turns. As only one action can be output at a time, we choose one of these turns. In this case, we can start with a \"turn_left\" action.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","Given the mission, we must use the key before attempting to open the door. The door is directly in front (at (2,2)), but we’re not carrying a key yet. Observing the grid from our position at (1,2), we see a pickup candidate (likely represented by –1) immediately to our right or left of our position. Since the agent is facing right (→), turning right will orient us downward toward the cell (1,3) which appears to contain the key. This is an efficient two‐step plan: turn right, then move forward to pick up the key.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","The key is immediately in front of the agent (at (1,3)). Since the agent is facing down, the best first move is to advance forward to pick up the key before attempting to use it to open the door.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The best next step is to start turning so that the agent can move toward the key. Since the agent is at (1,3) facing down but the key appears immediately above at (1,2), the agent must turn to face upward. To transform from down (direction 1) to up (direction 3) the simplest is to execute two right turns. (Other solutions with two left turns would also work but we pick one consistent action.)\n\nThus, the very next optimal action is:\nturn_right\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Analyzing the grid, we note:\n• The agent starts at (1,3) and is currently facing left. That means its forward cell (0,3) is a wall.\n• The mission requires that the agent use the key to open the door (located at (2,2)) and then get to the goal (at (3,3)). From (1,3) the safest short route is upward then right; for example, moving from (1,3) to (1,2) (which is a clear floor), then proceeding to (2,2).\n• Because the agent is facing left (west) but needs to head upward (north) first, the optimal immediate action is to reorient by turning right (which turns left into up).\n\nThus, the correct move is to turn right.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","The optimal move is to approach the nearest key. The agent is at (1,3) and facing up, and the key appears at (1,2). To pick it up later, the first step is to move toward that key. Therefore, the immediate optimal action is move_forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The door that we need to open is located one cell to our right at (2,2) while our agent is at (1,2) facing up. In order to face the door so that we may toggle it, we should first rotate right (changing our facing direction from up to east) before interacting with the door. \n\nAnswer: turn_right","Based on the grid configuration and mission objectives, the shortest route is to open the door that lies directly below the agent. The optimal initial step is to face the door. Since the agent is at (1, 2) facing right and the door is at (2, 2), the agent should turn right (to face down) so that the door (in front) can be toggled open in a subsequent step.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","The door is located at (2,2) and the agent is at (1,2) facing downward. Since the door (which needs to be opened with a key) lies immediately to the east of the agent’s position, the agent should first rotate so that it faces east. From facing down, a left turn will face east. \n\nAnswer: turn_left","The nearest key appears to be in the cell above the agent at (1,1). Since the agent is facing right (east), the best next move is to turn left to face north.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","The agent is at (1,2) facing up but the door is immediately to its right at (2,2). Even though the mission says “use the key to open the door,” and there is no key on the board, the immediate requirement is to open the door blocking the path to the goal. Being adjacent to the door, the agent must face it before toggling (opening) it. Since the door lies to the right of the agent, the first optimal action is to rotate right so that the agent faces the door.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","The door is right in front of the agent. Since the mission calls for using the key to open the door and the door must be toggled when close by, the agent should now face the door and use the toggle action. Assuming the key mechanism is implicitly handled (or the door isn’t locked because no key is present), the next optimal action is to toggle the door.\n\nAnswer: toggle","Since the agent is already facing the door (which is directly ahead) and the rules indicate that a closed door can be opened by toggling it, the optimal move is to use the toggle action now.\n\nAnswer: toggle","The optimal first move is to go forward into the cell that appears to contain the key (since the agent is facing right and (1,3) is likely the key cell). This way, the agent can then pick up the key in the next step to eventually toggle the door and proceed to the goal.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The door is immediately in front of the agent (the agent is at (1,2) facing right and the cell at (2,2) contains the door). Although the mission mentions using a key, there is no key visible on the grid and the agent isn’t holding anything. Given the rules—in particular that closed doors can be opened by using the toggle action when facing the door—the optimal and most direct move is to interact with the door.\n\nAnswer: toggle","The optimal next step is to reorient the agent toward the nearest key. The key appears to be in the adjacent cell above (at (1,1)), but the agent is currently facing right. Thus, the best immediate action is to turn left so that the agent faces upward.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","Based on the mission—first retrieving the key and then opening the door before proceeding to the goal—and knowing that the agent (at (1,2) facing up) has an adjacent cell in its forward direction (cell (1,1)) that appears to contain an object (with an atypical –1 value, which we interpret as the key), the optimal first step is to approach that cell. Therefore, the best action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the grid layout and relative positions, the agent is currently at (1,1) facing up. The door is at (2,2) and the key is assumed to be available—but not yet picked up—so the steps should eventually include obtaining the key before interacting with the door. However, since no key is immediately visible from the adjacent cells (and following the instructions to only choose one action at a time using the provided action list), the shortest route toward accomplishing the mission is to move toward the door.\n\nSince the agent is facing up but cannot directly move forward (that would be into a wall), the optimal first step is to reorient the agent so it can head toward the door. Turning right (90° clockwise) will have the agent facing east, which brings it closer to the door’s column. \n\nAnswer: turn_right","Based on the mission “use the key to open the door and then get to the goal” and the observed grid, the optimal plan is to first acquire the key—which we assume is immediately accessible by moving downward from (1,1). Since the agent is at (1,1) facing right, the very first step is to turn so the key is in the forward direction. To face downward from right, the agent should turn right.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Based on the grid, the agent is at (1,1) facing down. The cell immediately ahead (at (1,2)) is not fully observed (shown as unknown), and given the mission “use the key to open the door and then get to the goal” it is very likely that the key is located there. Hence, the optimal next step is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Given the mission you must eventually use a key to open the door—and the door (with value 4) lies immediately to the east of you—your first step is to face toward it. You are at (1,2) facing down (south). Turning left from south will reorient you eastward so that you can then approach the door and later pickup the key if it is adjacent or accessible. \n\nAnswer: turn_left","Based on the layout the agent is at (1,2) facing right. The door is at (2,2), i.e. directly below the agent. To later toggle\/open the door the agent must first face down. Since the key isn’t visible here (and the mission “use the key” implies it is already available or will be picked up en‐route), the most direct next step is to orient downward so that moving forward puts the agent adjacent to the door. Therefore, the optimal initial action is to turn right in order to face down.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Based on the observation and mission, the blue key is the one needed to open the door at (2,2) (since the door’s color is indicated as 2 and only the key at (3,2) has that matching color). However, the door blocks direct access so the agent must take a detour. The optimal route from the agent’s starting position at (1,2) is to head north (to eventually bypass the door) in order to reach (3,2) without picking up the other (non‐blue) keys. Because the agent is initially facing down, the first step is to reorient from down to north. To turn from facing down to north the agent must rotate by 180° (either two left turns or two right turns). In any case the very first move is to turn (for example, “turn_left”). \n\nAnswer: turn_left","Based on the mission “use the key to open the door and then get to the goal” and the observation, the agent is currently at (1,2) facing right. Immediately ahead at (2,2) is the door. Since the door can only be opened when holding the matching key and the agent’s inventory is empty, the agent must first get the key. (Even though the key isn’t explicitly shown on the grid, the mission implies it must be retrieved first.) A common choice is to assume the key is in an adjacent accessible floor cell – for example, upward from the agent at (1,1).\n\nBecause the agent is facing right, the quickest way to face the key’s cell is to turn left (which changes the direction from right[0] to up[3]). This follows the “shortest path” and “use only actions in the list” rules.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","The door we need to open is located one cell to the agent’s right relative to its current position at (1,2) while facing up. To face that cell, our first action should be to turn right. \n\nAnswer: turn_right","We begin at (1,2) facing right. To accomplish “use the key to open the door and then get to the goal” we first need to grab the key. Assuming the key is located at (1,1) (one of the floor cells with –1) just above the agent’s position, the very first step is to face that direction. Since the agent is facing right, the optimal immediate action is to turn left (which rotates it 90° counter‐clockwise so that it faces up).\n\nAnswer: turn_left","The door is immediately to your right (at (2,2)) and you’re facing up. To approach it along the shortest path, you should first rotate right so you face the door. \n\nAnswer: turn_right","I'll start by outlining the implicit plan using the grid information. The grid’s interior (not on the outer border of walls) contains our important objects: a key is assumed to be at one of the free floor cells (since none is explicitly marked as the key) and the door is clearly at the cell with value 4; the goal is the cell with value 8. According to the “mission” string “use the key to open the door and then get to the goal” the agent must first obtain the key and then approach the door to unlock it before proceeding to the goal.\n\nThe provided status tells us the agent is facing right (east) and is not carrying anything. If we assume that the key is located in a nearby free cell that is not obvious (for example, the cell immediately “above” the agent), then the first necessary action is to reorient the agent so that its path leads toward the location of the key.\n\nThus, the optimal first step is to change the agent’s orientation so that it faces the direction where the key is likely to be (for instance, if the key is just to the north of the agent, then turning left when facing right accomplishes that).\n\nAccording to the rules and allowed action list the valid commands are: turn_left, turn_right, move_forward, pickup, drop, toggle, done.\n\nGiven this reasoning, my first action is to execute a turn_left to face north.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","The agent is at (1,2) facing up so that moving forward will land on the cell (1,1), where the key is most likely located. Picking up the key is the first step, so the optimal action now is to advance.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the grid layout, the free cells are only those where the cell value is not a wall (cell value 2) and not blocked until we open the door. The door is at (2,2) and the goal is at (3,3). Since the only path from the agent’s starting cell (1,1) to the goal is through the closed door (which must be toggled to open), the agent must eventually approach and toggle that door. However, the mission states “use the key to open the door,” but no cell shows a key; this implies that either the door is only “closed” (so toggle suffices) or a key was expected to be picked up but isn’t visible. In either case, to follow the principle of moving on the shortest path, the first step is to head toward the door.\n\nThe agent is at (1,1) and the door is at (2,2). Examining the nearby free cells: (1,2) is a floor cell that lies to the right of the agent. Since the agent is facing up (toward row 0), it must first reorient to face right in order to head to (1,2) on the way toward (2,2).\n\nThus, the optimal first action is to turn right.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","The agent is at (1,1) facing right. To pick up the key first (found just below at cell (1,2)), the agent must turn to face down. Since turning right (from right) results in facing down, the best action is to turn_right.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Based on the mission “use the key to open the door and then get to the goal” and the observation, we note the following:\n• The agent is at (1,1) facing down.\n• The door is at (2,2) and the goal is at (3,3).\n• Although the mission requires obtaining a key (and using it on the door), the key is not present in the immediately observed cells.\n• Since the agent is not carrying anything and faces a clear forward cell (at (1,2)), the optimal immediate step (keeping to the provided action space and prioritizing shortest paths) is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the mission, the agent must eventually pick up a key and then open a door before proceeding to the goal. The door’s cell is shown at (2,2) so it lies to the east of the agent’s current location at (1,2). Since the agent is facing down, the first step toward reaching the door (and eventually getting the key and then toggling the door) is to reorient toward the door. When facing down, a left turn rotates the agent to face east. Therefore, the shortest‐path plan begins by turning left.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","Based on the current map layout, the door (object 4) is directly below the agent’s row (the agent is at (1,2) and the door is at (2,2)). Although the mission mentions using a key, no key (object 5) is visible in the grid and the agent is not carrying one. In order to interact with the door, the agent must first face it. The agent is currently facing right (→) so the optimal step is to turn so that he faces down (south), which is done by turning right.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","The optimal next move is to turn_left so that the agent faces the door (which is directly to the agent’s right).\n\nAnswer: turn_left","Based on the mission (\"use the key to open the door and then get to the goal\") and the layout, the door is directly to your right (at (2,2)) but you are not holding the key. The nearest candidate free cell that could contain the key is adjacent (either above at (1,1) or below at (1,3)). Since you’re currently facing right, a natural first step is to reposition yourself toward one of these free cells so you can pick up the key. For example, turning left will make you face north; then moving forward from (1,2) takes you to (1,1) where you can use “pickup” in the next move. This follows the rule of choosing the shortest path while preparing to get the key.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","The door (at cell (2,2)) lies immediately to your right, but you are currently facing up. Since your rules state that you must face the door to interact with it (and later toggle it), the shortest action now is to turn right.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Based on the mission “use the key to open the door and then get to the goal” and given that the agent starts at (1,2) facing right—with the door immediately ahead at (2,2)—the first necessary step is to pick up the key. Since the agent is not carrying anything yet, it must head to the nearby cell where the key is located. Assuming (as is common) that the key is in one of the adjacent open cells, the most efficient plan is first to turn to face the key.\n\nBecause the agent starts facing right and the key is best approached by moving upward (assuming it is in cell (1,1)), the correct immediate action is to turn left (which changes the facing direction from right to up) so the agent can then move forward to reach and pick up the key.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","Based on the mission “use the key to open the door and then get to the goal,” we must first secure the key before being able to open the door at (2,2). Although there isn’t an explicit cell showing a key (object type 5) in the observation, the fact that the agent isn’t carrying anything suggests that if a key exists it must be retrieved. The agent is at (1,2) facing up (toward row 1). Since the door is east of the agent (at (2,2)), and the key must be obtained first, the shortest initial move is to start an exploration toward where a key might be hidden rather than directly attempting the door. With the agent already facing up, the next best action is to move forward from (1,2) to (1,1) in search of the key.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the grid layout and our mission (“use the key to open the door and then get to the goal”), the agent’s optimal plan is to first pick up the key. The expected key is likely on one of the accessible floor cells below the agent (at (1,2)). However, the agent is at (1,1) facing up, and the cell immediately ahead ((1,0)) is a wall. Therefore, to head toward the cell (1,2) (which is directly below), the agent must begin turning so as to eventually face down. \nSince the quickest way to change from up (north) to down (south) is to turn 180° (achievable with two turn actions), a natural first step is to use one turn. Choosing “turn_right” as the first step, the agent will then be able to complete its rotation to face down in a subsequent move.\nAnswer: turn_right","Based on the board, the agent is at (1,1) facing right and the cell immediately in front (at (1,2)) appears to contain the key (as required by the mission). The optimal action is to advance into that cell to then pick up the key.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the grid layout—with the agent starting at (1,1) facing right and a clear path ahead (cell (1,2) is free floor)—the optimal first step is to move forward so that the agent can search for the key (which is needed to open the door at (2,2)) and then proceed to the goal (at (3,3)). \n\nThus, the best action to take is:\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the grid, the agent is at (1,1) facing right and the cell immediately ahead at (1,2) appears to contain the key needed to open the door at (2,2).

Since the agent is positioned at (1,1) facing right, the cell in front (at (1,2)) likely contains the key you need. Thus, you should issue the action to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the grid, the agent is at (1,1) facing right so that the cell immediately ahead (at (1,2)) is the next reachable position. Since the mission requires first using the key and then opening the door, the most logical step is to go toward the object (presumably the key) located there. To move to that cell, the shortest route is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The optimal plan is to first pick up the key before heading toward the door and then toward the goal. From the starting position (1,1) facing right, the shortest route is to advance into the cell in front (which we assume leads toward the key). Thus the best next action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Analysis:\nThe agent is positioned at (1,1) facing right. Its four neighboring cells are examined:\n• In front (to the right, i.e. cell (2,1)) is a wall.\n• Up (cell (1,0)) and left (cell (0,1)) are also walls.\n• Down (cell (1,2)) is the only accessible cell, and by mission context it likely contains the key required to open the door.\nSince the agent must first pick up the key before toggling the door, it must go down. However, facing right its “down” neighbor is not straight ahead.\nTherefore, the optimal first action is to turn right to face down.\nAnswer: turn_right","Based on the mission’s instructions and grid layout, the agent must eventually acquire the key and then use it (via the toggle action) on the door (located at (2,2)) before heading to the goal (at (3,3)). Currently the agent is at (1,1) and facing down. To begin following the shortest route, the agent should move forward (which will take it to (1,2)) where the key is likely to be encountered. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the mission and grid details, we first need to secure the key before opening the door. The agent is at (1,2) facing down, and the cell in front at (1,3) is most likely where the key is located. Therefore the next optimal step is to advance forward so that you can later pick up the key.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","We first analyze the board: The grid is a 5×5 with walls (object 2) forming the border. The agent is at (1,3) (with 0‐based indexing, column 1 and row 3) facing down. On the board there is a door at (2,2) and the goal at (3,3). According to the mission “use the key to open the door and then get to the goal” the key is assumed to be along the path – most logically located at (1,2), just above the agent. To reach (1,2) the agent (currently facing down) must reorient upward. Given that orientations are numbered (0=right, 1=down, 2=left, 3=up), the easiest turn from down (1) to up (3) is to do two \"turn_left\" actions (since 1→0→3). (One could also use two \"turn_right\" commands, but we choose the left turns here.)\n\nThus the optimal overall plan is:\n1. turn_left    [agent from facing down to facing right]\n2. turn_left    [agent now facing up toward (1,2)]\n3. move_forward  [agent goes from (1,3) to (1,2) to grab the key]\n4. pickup     [agent picks up the key]\n5. turn_right   [agent, now facing up, turns right to face east]\n6. move_forward  [agent moves to (2,2) where the door is]\n7. toggle     [agent opens the door]\n8. move_forward  [agent steps into the cell beyond door at (3,2)]\n9. turn_right   [agent reorients from east to down]\n10. move_forward [agent moves to (3,3), arriving at the goal]\n11. done     [mission complete]\n\nSince the agent acts one step at a time and we must output exactly one action from the allowed list in our response, our optimal first action is to reorient the agent so it can reach the key. That means the next action is:\n\nAnswer: turn_left","Based on the grid we see that the free interior cells (with −1) in row 1 include cell (1,2) which—by matching the door’s blue color (color 2 at cell [2,2,4])—is the most likely spot for the key. From the starting position at (1,3) facing right (east), the optimal plan is to get the key first by moving west into (1,2). Since the agent is facing east, it must first rotate 180° to face west. The simplest immediate step is to begin with a turn (a 90° rotation) in the proper direction.\n\nThus, the optimal first action is to start turning toward the key:\nAnswer: turn_left","The optimal next step is to head upward (since the agent is already facing up) toward the unknown key location, then later navigate to the door and finally to the goal. Since turning isn’t necessary, the shortest immediate action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The optimal next step is to reach the presumed key location. The agent is positioned at (1,2) and is facing upward. In the cell directly ahead, (1,1), the key should be located (as the mission “use the key” indicates that the key must be acquired first).

Since the agent is facing up and we assume the key is immediately ahead, the action is to move_forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The optimal next move is to orient the agent downward toward the open floor cell at (1,2). Since you are currently facing up, the best immediate action is to turn right (beginning the two‐turn maneuver needed to face down).\n\nAnswer: turn_right","The agent is at (1,1) facing right.

In the 5×5 grid the only non‐wall cell immediately in front of the agent (at (2,1)) is an open floor cell. Since the agent is not carrying anything it should first head toward the area where the key may be accessible (even if the key’s cell isn’t marked explicitly, the plan is to obtain it before reaching the door at (2,2)). Because the agent is facing right and the cell in front is free, the optimal and shortest action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the grid and mission, we first need to open the door. From the given grid the agent is at (1,1) and the door is at (2,2) (a closed door that must be toggled). A good high‐level plan is to approach the door from an adjacent cell (for example, coming from (1,2) so that the door is directly ahead) so that the agent can “toggle” it open and then later head via the open door (and its floor cells) to reach the goal at (3,3).\n\nA possible sequence is:\n1. Starting at (1,1) facing right (east), to head south toward (1,2) the agent should rotate right.\n2. Then “move_forward” to go from (1,1) to (1,2).\n3. Now the agent must face east so that the door at (2,2) is ahead; thus “turn_left” (south → east).\n4. With the door directly in front, “toggle” it to open.\n5.

From the agent’s current location the only free moves are upward or downward (since the east cell is blocked by a wall). The optimal plan is to move south (down) and then east to reach the goal.

Given that from “down” a 90° turn toward the right (i.e. turn left, because 0=right, 1=down) will put the agent in position to interact with the door (and then later pick up its key and toggle the door), the best choice is to turn_left.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","The grid shows the agent at (2,2) facing right.

Although the grid shows two door cells (cells with a “4” in the third position), to follow mission order we assume that the red door (color red) should be targeted first. Since the only action we can output is one of the provided action words and the agent is currently at (5,3) facing left (i.e. facing west) while the red door (assumed to be at (8,4)) is to the southeast, a good first step is to reorient the agent toward the south so that later it can turn further to face east and approach the door along a shortest (Manhattan) path. Moving directly forward in the current direction would move westward, away from the door. Therefore the optimal immediate action is to turn left (which from facing west will face south), so that the agent can then later move closer toward (8,4).\n\nAnswer: turn_left","The red door (at cell [3,2]) is the first door to open, and from your current position at (5,3) facing down, the shortest route begins by turning right (which makes you face left toward the red door). \n\nAnswer: turn_right","The red door appears to be the one at cell (3,2) and the blue door at (8,4). From the current agent position (5,3) facing left, a shortest route to the red door is to move forward twice to reach (3,3) then turn right (to face north) and move forward once to arrive at (3,2) where you can then use toggle to open it. Since the next optimal action is to proceed along that route, the best next step is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The red door is the nearer one. To open it, we need to get adjacent and face it. The optimal next step is to advance from (4,3) into (3,3), from where we can later turn to face the door at (3,2) and then use toggle. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","I analyze the situation: The red door appears to be at (3,2) (the only door cell on the “left” side of the agent) while the blue door is later in the mission (at (8,4)). The mission order is to open the red door before attempting the blue door. The agent is at (4,3) facing left. To reach a position to toggle the red door (i.e. to be adjacent and facing it), the agent should first go north. From its current orientation (left), a right turn will make it face up. Therefore, the optimal first action is to \"turn_right\".\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Based on the mission “open the red door then the blue door” the first step is to move toward and open the red door. Although the grid shows two door‐cells (those with value 4), only one would correspond to the red door. (Recall the door’s color is given by its second value with 0 = red, 1 = green, 2 = blue, etc.) Neither door cell clearly shows “0” as its color. In such cases the optimal strategy is to assume that the red door is not immediately in front of the agent. With the agent at (4,3) facing up we want to start a path‐planning routine that will eventually get us adjacent to and in front of the red door. A common early maneuver in these grid scenarios is to reorient (for instance, turn left) so that subsequent forward moves (and later using “toggle” when adjacent) head in the correct direction along the shortest path.\n\nTherefore the next (first) action is to turn left.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","The optimal plan is to approach the red door first, which is at (3,2). From your current position (4,3) facing left, the quickest way is to get adjacent to the door on the cell (4,2) (which is immediately above you). In order to move from facing left to going upward, you must rotate 90° clockwise. Hence, your next optimal action is:\n\nAnswer: turn_right","The best next step is to start approaching the red door at (3,2). Since you are at (4,3) facing up, the optimal sequence is to move forward (to (4,2)), then turn left to face the door, then move forward into the door cell, and finally use toggle to open it. For this step the optimal action is:\n\nAnswer: move_forward","We note that the red door is assumed to be immediately to the left of the agent’s start at (4,2) (i.e. at (3,2)). Since the agent is facing up, the optimal first move is to rotate left so as to face west toward that door. \n\nAnswer: turn_left","Based on the observation and mission, the red door is immediately to the left of the agent (at (3,2)) and is assumed to be closed. Since the agent is already facing left, the optimal shortest-action to open the door is to use the toggle action.\n\nAnswer: toggle","Based on your current observation, the agent’s immediate cell (4,2) is facing left toward the door at (3,2). However, that door is blue (its color code is 2) while the mission requires you to open the red door first. Therefore, you should avoid interacting (toggling) with the door immediately in front. A prudent move is to start navigating toward where the red door is located. One safe initial maneuver is to change direction. For example, turning left will direct you away from the blue door so you can search for the red door along the proper route.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","The nearest door that the agent can interact with is located at (3,2), which is directly to its left. Since the agent is initially facing down, it must rotate to face left. To face left from down, the agent should execute a right turn (clockwise rotation). \n\nAnswer: turn_right","The red door is located at (3,2), which is directly one cell to the left of the agent at (4,2). Since the agent is already facing left, it is correctly oriented to open the red door with a \"toggle\" action. We choose \"toggle\" as the first move to open the red door.\n\nAnswer: toggle","The red door is immediately in front of the agent (cell (3,2)) as the agent is at (4,2) facing left; thus to open the red door according to the rules, the optimal action is to use \"toggle\".\n\nAnswer: toggle","Based on the mission “open the red door then the blue door” and the fact that the agent is at (4,2) facing left, the cell immediately in front (at (3,2)) is a door. Since we must open the red door first and close doors are opened by using the toggle command when facing them, the optimal first move is to toggle the door ahead.\n\nAnswer: toggle","The agent is at (4,2) facing left, and the cell immediately in front (at (3,2)) holds a door. Since the mission requires that the red door be opened first and the agent is directly facing a door, the optimal action is to toggle it.\n\nAnswer: toggle","The red door is directly in front of the agent (at cell (3,2)) because the agent is at (4,2) facing left. Since the mission is to open the red door first, and we must be facing the door to use the \"toggle\" action, the optimal action is to toggle (open) the door.\n\nAnswer: toggle","The red key is needed to open the locked red door. The red key is located at (5,0) while you are at (4,2) facing left. To begin moving toward the red key along one of the shortest routes, the best immediate step is to turn right to reorient yourself upward.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Based on the mission’s order (“open the red door then the blue door”) and the fact that—when not carrying anything—the agent should begin by approaching the first door (red), the optimal next step is to move toward it. The agent is facing up at (4,2), and the cell directly ahead (4,1) is available (and could be the red door’s location or leads toward it). Therefore the best next action is to move_forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the mission “open the red door then the blue door” and the observation indicating that when facing up the cell ahead (at (4,0)) is a door (the red door), the shortest and safest action is to face that door and use the toggle command to open it first.\n\nAnswer: toggle","Based on the agent’s starting position (4,1) facing up and the mission to first open the red door (which we assume is the door at (3,2)), the shortest approach is to reduce the horizontal difference first. The red door lies to the left and down relative to the agent. By turning left, the agent will face toward the left which brings it closer horizontally to (3,2) so it can later adjust its orientation to move down.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","Given the mission “open the red door then the blue door” and the current situation:\n• The agent is at (4,1), facing left.\n• The adjacent cell in front ((3,1)) is a wall.\n• To eventually get beside the red door (which we assume is at (3,2)), a good plan is to head south first (moving from (4,1) to (4,2)) so that from (4,2) the red door (at (3,2)) is immediately to the west.\n• Since the agent is facing left (west) initially, turning left from west rotates the agent 90° counter‐clockwise, which from west gives south.\nThus, the immediate, optimal next action is to “turn_left”.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","Based on the relative positions, the red door appears to be one step laterally from the position the agent will reach after moving forward. Since the agent is at (4,1) facing down and the cell in front (at (4,2)) is clear, the optimal next step is to move forward so that the agent can later turn toward the door. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the grid layout, the agent is at (4, 2) facing down and the red door is at (3, 2) – immediately to the left of the agent. In order to face that door, starting from “down” (which is coded as 1) the agent needs to turn right (which will change its direction from down to west, coded as 2), directly toward the red door. \n\nAnswer: turn_right","The red door is immediately to the left of the agent at (3,2) (since the agent is at (4,2) and facing left), so the optimal action is to open it by using toggle.\n\nAnswer: toggle","The agent is immediately facing a door (the cell to its left, at (3,2)). Since the mission is to open the red door first and the door directly ahead is presumed to be that door, the optimal action is to toggle it. \n\nAnswer: toggle","Based on the grid the agent is at (4,2) and is facing left so that the cell immediately in front is (3,2). That cell is shown with a value (…4) indicating it is a door. Since the mission instructs \"open the red door then the blue door\" and the closest door (in front of the agent) should be the red door, the optimal first move is to interact with it. For interacting with a closed door the rules state you must use the toggle action. \n\nAnswer: toggle","The door directly in front of the agent (at (3,2)) is immediately reachable and, according to the rules, a closed door must be opened using the \"toggle\" action. Despite the mission stating \"open the red door then the blue door,\" the agent’s current view shows a door already in front. Given the shortest-path requirement and the fact that the door is immediately ahead, the best next action is to toggle that door.\n\nAnswer: toggle","Based on the mission order you provided (“open the red door then the blue door”) and noting that although a door is immediately in front of the agent (at (3,2)) it’s the blue door—which should be opened only after the red door—the best immediate action is to start heading toward the red door. With the agent located at (4,2) and facing left (←), it can begin this longer route by reorienting itself so that it can navigate toward the red door. One simple, shortest‐path option is to turn left (which makes it face down) and then later proceed (via forward motions and another turn) to approach the red door’s location. \n\nThus, the correct immediate action is: \n\nAnswer: turn_left","The red door is located at (3,2), immediately to the west of the agent at (4,2).
