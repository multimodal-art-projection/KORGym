Turn right to face down\n2. Move forward to (2, 2)\n3. Move forward to (2, 3)\n4. Move forward to (2, 4)\n5. Move forward to (2, 5)\n6. Turn right to face left\n7. Move forward to (6, 5)\n8. Turn right again to face up\n9. Move forward multiple times until I reach (6, 1)\n10. Turn right to face right\n11. Move forward to reach the green goal at (7, 1)\n\nBut first, I need to move forward since I'm already facing right (east). This is the first step to start navigating toward my goal.\n\nAnswer: move_forward"],"prompt":"\n    You are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a game board and rules.\n    Your task is:\n    - First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n    - Second, output the answer in the required format.

The closest door is at (3, 0), which I can reach by turning around and moving forward.\n\nThe most efficient approach is to turn left twice (to face up ↑) and then move forward once.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","Looking at the grid, I need to find and go to the purple door.\n\nLet me analyze the grid:\n- I am at position (3, 1) facing up (agent with value 10)\n- I need to find a door (object_type=4) with color=3 (purple)\n\nScanning the grid for purple doors:\n- I see a door at position (0, 2) but I can't tell the color from this representation\n- I see a door at position (3, 0)\n- I see a door at position (3, 4)\n- I see a door at position (5, 2)\n\nLet me check which of these is the purple door:\n- At (0, 2), the cell is [0, 2, 4] - this is a blue door (color=2)\n- At (3, 0), the cell is [3, 0, 4] - this is a red door (color=0)\n- At (3, 4), the cell is [3, 4, 4] - this is a yellow door (color=4)\n- At (5, 2), the cell is [5, 2, 4] - this is a blue door (color=2)\n\nI don't see a purple door (color=3) in the observation. Let me double-check...\n\nWait, I need to reconsider how I'm interpreting the grid. The observation format is (width, height, 3) where the last dimension contains [object_type, color, state].\n\nLooking for a cell with object_type=4 (door) and color=3 (purple):\n- The cell at [0, 3, 2] has object_type=0 (not a door) and color=3 (purple)\n\nI see the issue - I need to check the values correctly.\n\nLet me redo my analysis: For a door with the color purple, I'm looking for a cell where the first value is 4 (door) and the second value is 3 (purple).\n\nChecking all door positions:\n- At (0, 2): [0, 2, 4] - This is not in the right format for a door\n- At (3, 0): [3, 0, 4] - This is not in the right format for a door\n- At (3, 4): [3, 4, 4] - This is not in the right format for a door\n- At (5, 2): [5, 2, 4] - This is not in the right format for a door\n\nI think there's a mismatch in how I'm reading the grid. The observation provides [object_type, color, state], but the coordinates are (x, y), so I should be looking at observation[x][y] to find the data.\n\nLooking at:\n- observation[0][2] = [0, 2, 4] - Not a door (first value is 0)\n- observation[3][0] = [3, 0, 4] - This is a door (4) with color red (0)\n- observation[3][4] = [3, 4, 4] - This is a door (4) with color yellow (4)\n- observation[5][2] = [5, 2, 4] - This is a door (4) with color blue (2)\n\nI need to look for the purple door (color=3). Since I didn't find it in my list, let me scan the entire grid more carefully for object_type=4 and color=3.\n\nAfter re-analyzing, I see the format is different. The data seems to be:\n- Each [x, y, value] represents one aspect of the cell\n- I'm looking for a cell where value=4 (door) and the corresponding color value is 3 (purple)\n\nGiven the agent is at (3, 1) facing up, I can move forward to (3, 0) to reach the red door.\n\nSince I need to go to the purple door, I need to carefully locate it. Looking at the pattern, I now believe the first digit is the x-coordinate, the second is the y-coordinate, and the third is the object type.\n\nGiven the complex observation format, I should move forward to explore more of the grid and locate the purple door.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Looking at the grid environment, I need to reach the purple door.\n\nFirst, let me analyze the grid:\n- I'm at position (3, 1) facing up (direction 3)\n- A purple door should have object_type=4 and color=3\n- Looking at the observation, I see a purple door at position (0, 3) based on the coordinates [0, 3, 2]\n\nTo get to the purple door at (0, 3), I need to:\n1.

However, the mission clearly states I need to go to the purple door.\n\nGiven that I'm at (2, 1) facing left and have only 3 steps remaining, I need to make an efficient move.
