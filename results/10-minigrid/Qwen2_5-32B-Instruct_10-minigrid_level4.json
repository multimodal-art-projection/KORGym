However, since the agent is facing down, the cell directly ahead (4, 10) would be the next step if it were clear.

Since the mission is to reach the goal and there's no information about closed or locked doors, or necessary keys, the most straightforward action would be to continue moving forward if the path is clear.\n\nGiven that the agent is facing down and has no specific obstacles mentioned in the immediate cells below, the optimal action is to move forward towards the goal.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Given the provided observation, the agent is positioned at (8, 14) facing down. The goal is to reach the goal square. Since the agent is facing down and there's no immediate indication of obstacles or closed\/locked doors directly ahead, the optimal action would be to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the provided observation, the agent is currently at (8, 15) facing down (↓). The grid seems to have a lot of empty spaces and walls, but no immediate obstacles directly below the agent's current position.

There's no immediate obstacle or lava directly below the agent, which means moving forward would be a safe action towards reaching the goal.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the provided observation, the agent is currently facing down (direction 1) at coordinates (8, 17). The mission is to reach the goal. Since the grid representation does not explicitly show the location of the goal or any obstacles like walls, lava, or closed\/locked doors, we must infer the next best step.\n\nGiven that the agent is facing down, and there's no specific indication of obstacles directly ahead, the logical next action would be to move forward to explore further down towards the goal.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Given the observation, the agent is currently facing down and positioned at (8, 17). The immediate cells below, to the left, and to the right are walls, which means moving forward would result in hitting a wall. There's no immediate danger of lava or closed\/locked doors in the direct vicinity that needs to be addressed.\n\nThe next step should logically be to turn and find a path that leads towards the goal. Since there's a wall directly in front, turning either left or right could potentially lead to an open path. Given no specific information about the layout beyond the immediate surroundings, we can choose to turn left to explore the leftward path first.\n\nTherefore, the action to take is `turn_left`.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","Given the provided observation and the current position of the agent, the immediate surroundings seem to consist mostly of walls (-1 indicates an out-of-bound or undefined area). The agent is currently facing right (→) at position (8, 17).\n\nSince the agent cannot move forward due to the presence of walls and there are no visible objects that need interaction (like keys or closed doors) in the immediate vicinity, the next logical step would be to turn to explore other directions.\n\nGiven the priority of avoiding dangerous areas and prioritizing movement towards the goal, turning left seems like a reasonable choice to start exploring other possible paths.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","Given the mission is to reach the goal, and considering the current orientation of the agent facing upwards, the immediate surroundings suggest there's a wall directly above the agent. Therefore, the next logical step would be to rotate to the right to face east (rightwards), in search of a path that leads to the goal while avoiding walls and other obstacles.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Given the provided grid and the agent's current state, we can deduce the immediate surroundings and determine the next best action.\n\nThe agent is currently at (8, 17), facing right (→). From the observation, it seems like the cells immediately to the right and below the agent are walls (object_type = 1), while the cells above and to the left are empty floors (object_type = 3). There are no immediate obstacles or dangerous areas (like lava) in the vicinity that need to be avoided. Also, there is no indication of a door or key within the visible range, so there's no need to toggle or pick up anything.\n\nSince the agent's goal is to reach the goal and there's an empty space to the left, turning left would allow the agent to move towards a potential path without hitting any walls.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","Based on the given observation, the agent is currently facing upwards (direction 3). There is no immediate obstacle directly above it, which means the next logical step would be to move forward towards the goal.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Given the observation, the agent is currently facing up (direction 3). To reach the goal, the agent needs to navigate downwards since the surrounding area directly above it is blocked by walls or out of bounds.\n\nThe immediate next action should be to rotate the agent to face down so that it can start moving towards the goal. Therefore, the action needed is `turn_right`.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","Given the observation and the mission, the agent is currently facing right (→) at coordinates (8, 16). The immediate surroundings suggest there's no immediate obstacle directly ahead (to the right), and there's no information indicating the presence of closed doors, locked doors, or keys that would necessitate additional actions like 'toggle' or 'pickup'.\n\nThe mission is simply to reach the goal. Since the agent is not carrying anything, there's no need for 'drop'. Also, since there's no mention of lava or other dangerous areas directly adjacent, the safest and most direct action is to move forward towards the goal.\n\nTherefore, the optimal action in this scenario is:\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Given the mission to reach the goal and the current observation, the agent is facing right (→) at position (8, 16). Since the goal has not been specified in terms of its location or color in the observation, we can infer that the goal is somewhere on the map, and the agent needs to navigate towards it while avoiding obstacles like walls and lava.\n\nFrom the observation, the immediate cells to the right of the agent (which is the direction it's facing) are empty, indicating a safe path forward. There's no immediate indication of needing to pick up keys, toggle doors, or avoid dangers such as lava in the direct line of sight.\n\nTherefore, the optimal action for the agent in this scenario would be to move forward, continuing towards the goal while avoiding any immediate obstacles.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the provided observation, the agent is currently facing right (→) and located at coordinates (8, 16). The immediate cells ahead of the agent (to the right) are walls or out of bounds based on the pattern shown in the grid.

The agent is not carrying anything and has 30 steps remaining. From the observation, we can infer that the agent is surrounded by walls and floors, and there are no immediate obstacles or dangerous areas like lava directly above, which is the direction the agent is facing.\n\nSince the agent is facing up and there are no immediate obstacles, the optimal action would be to move forward to explore further and get closer to the goal. Therefore, the action should be:\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Based on the provided observation, the agent is facing upwards (↑) at position (8, 13). The immediate cells above the agent are walls (object_type = 2), which means moving forward into a wall is not possible and would result in a collision.
