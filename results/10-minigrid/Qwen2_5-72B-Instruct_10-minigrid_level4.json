The mission is to reach the goal, and from the grid, it seems the goal is located at the bottom-right corner, specifically at (18, 18). Given the agent's current direction, the most immediate action is to move forward to continue descending towards the goal.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","Given the current observation, the agent is facing down at position (16, 8).

From the given grid, it seems like the agent is on an open floor (object_type 3) and there are no immediate obstacles in front of the agent in the down direction.\n\nTo progress, the agent should move forward if the path is clear.

The agent cannot move forward.\n- The cell to the left of the agent at (15, 8) is [15, 8, [16, 1, -1]], which is an empty space or floor. This is a viable move.\n- The cell to the right of the agent at (17, 8) is [17, 8, [16, 1, -1]], which is also an empty space or floor. This is another viable move.\n\nGiven that moving forward is not an option and the mission is to reach the goal, the agent should turn left or right to explore the path to the goal.

The goal is to fetch a purple ball. The purple ball is located at (4, 2). The agent can move forward to (7, 1), then turn left to face up, and then move forward to (7, 2). However, the agent needs to move left to (6, 2) and then up to (4, 2) to reach the purple ball. \n\nSince the agent is facing right and there is no obstacle, the first action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The agent is currently at position (6, 1) facing right (→). The purple ball is located at position (6, 3). To reach the purple ball, the agent needs to move forward twice. The first step is to move forward to position (7, 1).\n\nHowever, the cell (7, 1) is not a valid position as it is outside the grid. Therefore, the agent should move forward once to position (6, 2), and then move forward again to reach the purple ball at (6, 3).\n\nSince the agent is facing the correct direction and the path is clear, the first action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The agent is currently facing right (→) and is located at (6, 1).

After picking up the key, the agent can move back to the door and use the key to open it.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n1. Move down to (4, 4).\n2. Move left to (3, 4) to pick up the key.\n3. Move right to (4, 4).\n4. Move down to (5, 4) to reach the door.\n5.

However, the first step is to move forward to (5, 1).\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The agent is currently facing right (→) and located at (4, 1). The grid shows that the agent is not carrying anything and needs to open a door. The door is located at (5, 4) and is of type 4 (DOOR) and state 1 (closed). To reach the door, the agent needs to move to its position and then toggle it. The shortest path involves moving forward to (5, 1), then moving down to (5, 4).

The grid shows a green key at position (3, 4) and a door at position (5, 4). The goal is to open the door, which will require picking up the key first and then using it to open the door. The shortest path to the key is to move forward twice, pick up the key, and then move forward two more times to reach the door. However, since the agent can only perform one action at a time, the first action should be to move forward towards the key.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","The agent is currently facing right and is positioned at (4, 1).
