The purple door (color 3, object_type 4) is located at grid cell (3, 0) with state 0 (open). The agent is at (3, 1) facing right (→). \n\nTo reach (3, 0), the agent needs to move upward (toward decreasing y-coordinates).

Since the agent is initially facing up, turning right (clockwise) will adjust its direction to face right (direction 0), which is a necessary first step to align towards the target.\n\n### Optimal Action:\nThe first step to reach the purple door is to turn right, reorienting the agent to face right (direction 0), which allows subsequent movement towards the target.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","\nTo solve the mission of reaching the purple door, we first need to identify the purple door's location and determine the optimal path from the agent's current position. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Agent Position and Direction**: The agent is at (3, 1) and facing right (→).\n- **Mission**: Reach the purple door (color 3, as per the problem's color mapping: 3=PURPLE).\n- **Grid Analysis**: The purple door is identified as a cell with `object_type=4` (DOOR) and `color=3` (PURPLE). Based on the observation, the purple door is located at (3, 0) (x=3, y=0).\n\n### Path Planning:\nThe agent needs to move from (3, 1) to (3, 0). Since the agent is currently facing right (→), it is not aligned with the purple door (which is directly above at (3, 0)). To face the door, the agent must rotate to face up (↑). \n\n### Action Selection:\n- Turning left (90° counter-clockwise) from facing right (→) will change the agent's direction to up (↑). This aligns the agent with the purple door, allowing a subsequent `move_forward` to reach the target.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","\n\nTo solve the mission of reaching the purple door, we first identify the purple door's location and the agent's current state.

The purple door is a cell with `object_type=4` and `color=3` (PURPLE), located at (4, 3). \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Agent Position and Direction**: The agent is at (3, 1) facing up (↑). To reach (4, 3), the agent needs to move down (increasing y) twice and right (increasing x) once.\n2. **Path Analysis**: The shortest path requires adjusting the agent's direction to face down first (since moving up from (3, 1) leads to (3, 0), which is not toward the target). Facing down allows the agent to move toward (3, 2) and (3, 3), then turn right to reach (4, 3).\n3. **Immediate Action**: The agent is currently facing up. To face down (the required direction for the first segment of the path), the agent must turn right twice (up → right → down). The first step is to initiate this direction change by turning right.\n\n### Optimal Action:\nThe first action to start adjusting the agent's direction toward the target is `turn_right`.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","\n\nTo solve the mission of reaching the purple door, we first identify the purple door's location. The purple door (object_type=4, color=3) is found at coordinates (3, 4) based on the observation grid. \n\nThe agent is located at (1, 3) and facing right (→). The immediate cell in front of the agent (facing right) is (2, 3), which is a FLOOR (object_type=3), meaning it is passable. To move closer to the purple door, the optimal first action is to move forward into this cell.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\nTo solve the mission of reaching the purple door, we first identify the purple door's location. The purple door (color 3) is at coordinates (4, 3) (object_type 4, color 3). The agent is at (4, 1) facing right (→). \n\nThe agent needs to move from (4, 1) to (4, 3). Since the agent is currently facing right, it must turn to face down (toward increasing y-values) to move toward (4, 3). Turning right (90° clockwise) changes the agent's direction from right (0) to down (1). After turning, the agent can move forward to reach the purple door. \n\nThe first required action is to turn right to align with the correct direction. \n\nAnswer: turn_right","\nTo solve the mission of reaching the purple door, we first identify the purple door's location. The purple door has `object_type=4` (DOOR) and `color=3` (purple). From the observation, the purple door is at coordinates (4, 3). \n\nThe agent is at (4, 1) and facing down (direction 1). Facing down means the agent's forward direction is toward increasing y-values (downward on the grid). The path from the agent's current position (4, 1) to the purple door (4, 3) is a straight line downward: (4, 1) → (4, 2) → (4, 3). \n\nNext, we check if the path is clear. The cells (4, 2) and (4, 3) are both DOORs, but their states are `-1` (not explicitly closed or locked). Since there are no walls, lava, or other obstacles blocking the path, and the agent is prioritizing the shortest path, moving forward is safe and optimal. \n\nThus, the first action to take is to move forward toward (4, 2) to progress toward the purple door.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\n\n\nTo solve the mission \"go to the purple door,\" we first identify the purple door's location. Purple corresponds to color 3, and doors have object_type 4. From the observation, the purple door is at (4, 3) (x=4, y=3), as it has `[object_type=4, color=3, state=-1]` (assuming state=-1 is a typo for closed\/locked, but prioritizing the color and object type). \n\nThe agent is at (4, 2), facing down (direction 1), directly in front of the purple door at (4, 3). Since the mission requires reaching the purple door, and the agent is already positioned to interact with it, the next step is to check if the door is closed\/locked. \n\nFor doors, `state=0` is open, `state=1` is closed, and `state=2` is locked. The purple door's state is listed as `-1`, but based on context, it is likely closed (state=1). To open a closed door, the agent must use the `toggle` action while facing it. \n\nThus, the optimal action is to toggle the door to open it, enabling the agent to move forward into the door's cell afterward. \n\nAnswer: toggle"],"prompt":"\n    You are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a game board and rules.\n    Your task is:\n    - First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n    - Second, output the answer in the required format.

Turning right (facing down) allows movement into (6, 2), a passable cell (BALL, object_type=6).\n\nThe optimal first action is to turn right to face down, enabling movement toward the goal while avoiding immediate obstacles.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","\nTo solve the mission of avoiding lava and reaching the green goal square, the agent must navigate from (6, 1) (facing down) to (7, 7) while avoiding lava (object_type 9). The lava is located at y=4 (x=1-6), so the agent must avoid this row. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Agent Position and Direction**: The agent is at (6, 1) facing down (direction 1). Moving forward from this position leads to (6, 2).\n2. **Lava Location**: A horizontal line of lava exists at y=4 (x=1-6), blocking direct southward movement beyond y=3.\n3. **Goal Location**: The goal is at (7, 7), which is accessible from (6, 7) (eastward move from (6, 7) to (7, 7)).\n4. **Path Analysis**: The shortest path involves moving south (down) to (6, 2) and (6, 3) (both BALLs, which are passable), then navigating around the lava to reach (6, 7) and finally the goal.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nThe agent is facing down, and the cell directly in front (y=2) is (6, 2), which contains a BALL (object_type 6). BALLs are not obstacles, so the path is clear. The first step is to move forward to (6, 2) to progress toward the goal.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to navigate from the agent's current position (6, 2) facing down to the green goal square (object_type 8, color 1) while avoiding lava (object_type 9). \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Agent Position and Direction**: The agent is at (6, 2) facing down (direction 1). The goal is located at (8, 1) (x=8, y=1), which is to the right and slightly up from the agent's current position.\n2. **Lava Avoidance**: Lava is present at (x=1 to 6, y=4), forming a horizontal line that must be avoided. The agent’s current path down (toward y=3, 4) is safe initially but leads to lava at y=4, so this direction is not optimal.\n3. **Shortest Path**: The shortest path to the green goal involves moving right (increasing x) and then up (decreasing y). \n\n### Action Plan:\nThe agent is currently facing down. To move toward the goal (right and up), the agent first needs to face right. This requires turning left (90° counter-clockwise), which changes the direction from down (1) to right (0). After turning, the agent can move forward toward the goal.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","\nTo solve the mission of avoiding lava and reaching the green goal square, we analyze the grid and agent's state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Agent Position**: (6, 2) facing right (→).\n- **Goal**: Located at (7, 7) (object_type=8, mission specifies \"green goal\").\n- **Lava**: Present in cells (1-6, 4) (y=4, x=1 to 6), forming a horizontal barrier.\n- **Path Analysis**: The shortest path from the agent to the goal avoids the lava. Since the agent is facing right, moving forward to (7, 2) (which is not lava or a wall) is safe. From (7, 2), the agent can turn right to face down and proceed to (7, 7) without encountering lava.\n\n### Optimal Action:\nThe first step is to move forward to (7, 2), as this is the initial step in the shortest path to the goal.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\n\nTo solve the mission of avoiding lava and reaching the green goal square, we analyze the grid and agent's state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Agent Position & Direction**: The agent is at (7, 2) (x=7, y=2) and facing right (direction 0).\n- **Goal Location**: The goal (object_type=8) is at (7, 7) (x=7, y=7), directly south (down) of the agent.\n- **Path Analysis**: The path from (7, 2) to (7, 7) is clear of lava (object_type=9) and obstacles. The cells between (7, 2) and (7, 7) (y=3 to y=6) are safe (likely FLOOR, as they are not walls or lava).\n- **Current Facing Direction**: The agent faces right (x+1), but the cell directly in front (x=8, y=2) is a wall (object_type=2), blocking movement.\n\n### Action Selection:\nTo reach the goal, the agent must face down (direction 1) to move toward y=7. Since the agent is currently facing right (direction 0), turning right (90° clockwise) will change the direction to down (direction 1), aligning the agent with the path to the goal.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","\nTo solve the mission of avoiding lava and reaching the green goal square, we analyze the grid and agent's situation:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Agent Position and Direction**: The agent is at (7, 2) facing down (↓). This means moving forward increases the y-coordinate.\n- **Goal Location**: The green goal square (object_type 8) is at (7, 7).\n- **Lava Avoidance**: Lava (object_type 9) is restricted to x=1-6, y=4. The agent’s column (x=7) does not contain lava in this row, so y=4 in x=7 is safe.\n- **Path Analysis**: The direct path from (7, 2) to (7, 7) (increasing y) is clear. The cells (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6) are all passable (assumed to be FLOOR, as indicated by grid data with -1, which likely represents FLOOR). No obstacles (walls, locked doors, or lava) block this path.\n\n### Optimal Action:\nSince the agent is facing down and the path forward to the goal is clear, the shortest path is to move forward toward the goal.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\nTo solve the problem, we need to navigate the agent from its current position to the green goal square while avoiding lava. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Agent Position & Direction**: The agent is at (7, 3) and facing down (direction 1). Facing down means the agent's forward direction is along the increasing y-axis (towards higher y-coordinates).\n- **Goal Location**: The goal (object_type 8) is identified at (7, 7) based on the observation. The mission specifies reaching the \"green goal square,\" so we assume the goal’s color is green (color 1).\n- **Path Analysis**: The shortest path from (7, 3) to (7, 7) is directly downward (increasing y). The agent is already facing down, so moving forward will advance it toward the goal.\n- **Obstacles & Lava**: No lava (object_type 9) is detected in the path from (7, 3) to (7, 7). The cells between (7, 3) and (7, 7) (i.e., (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6)) are passable (no walls or blocked cells), allowing safe movement.\n\n### Optimal Action:\nSince the agent is facing the goal and the path is clear, the shortest path is achieved by moving forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\nTo solve the problem, we need to navigate the agent from its current position to the green goal square while avoiding lava.

From the observation, the cell (7, 7) is identified as the goal (object_type 8).\n3. **Path Analysis**: The agent is directly aligned with the goal along the y-axis (same x-coordinate, 7). The path from (7, 5) to (7, 7) involves moving forward twice: first to (7, 6), then to (7, 7). \n4. **Obstacles and Lava**: No lava (object_type 9) or obstacles (e.g., walls, locked doors) are present in the direct path from (7, 5) to (7, 7).

Checking (1,2) confirms it is passable (object_type 1, EMPTY). Moving forward to (1,2) is safe and aligns with the shortest path toward the goal. Other initial actions (e.g., turning left\/right) either lead to walls or lava, making them invalid. Thus, the optimal first action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\nTo solve the mission of avoiding lava and reaching the green goal square, we analyze the agent's position, direction, and the grid layout. The agent is at (1, 2) facing down (direction 1), and the goal is identified at (3, 3) (object_type 8, green color). \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Agent's Direction**: Facing down (toward increasing y-coordinates), so the cell directly in front is (1, 3).\n2. **Front Cell Check**: The cell (1, 3) is verified to be FLOOR (object_type 3), which is safe (not lava or a wall).\n3. **Shortest Path**: The shortest path to the goal (3, 3) from (1, 2) involves moving down to (1, 3) first, then right to (2, 3), and finally right to (3, 3).

The mission specifies a \"green goal,\" but the only goal in the grid is at (3, 3) (assumed to be the target despite potential color discrepancies).\n- **Lava**: Present at (2, 1) and (2, 2) (object_type=9), which must be avoided.\n- **Path Analysis**: The shortest path from (1, 3) to (3, 3) requires moving east (right) twice. The agent currently faces down, so adjusting direction to east is necessary.\n\n### Action Plan:\n1. **Turn Left**: Rotate 90° counter-clockwise to face east (direction 0), aligning with the eastward path to the goal.\n2. **Move Forward**: Advance east to (2, 3) (clear path, no lava).\n3. **Move Forward**: Advance east again to (3, 3), reaching the goal.\n\nThe first required action is to turn left to face the correct direction.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we analyze the grid, agent's position, and mission.

Based on the observation, (2, 3) is not marked as lava or a wall (object_type=2), and the path appears clear.\n\n### Optimal Action:\nSince the direct path to the goal (right twice) is the shortest and avoids lava, the agent should move forward to progress toward the goal.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\n\nTo solve the mission of avoiding lava and reaching the green goal square, we analyze the grid and agent's state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Agent Position & Direction**: The agent is at (2, 3) facing right (→), meaning their forward direction is toward increasing x-coordinates.\n- **Goal Location**: The goal (object_type 8) is at (3, 3), directly in front of the agent (x=3, y=3).\n- **Path Safety**: The cell in front of the agent (3, 3) is FLOOR (object_type 3), which is passable and not lava (object_type 9).

The agent is at (1, 1) facing right (→). The green goal (object_type=8, color=1) is located at (7, 1) based on the observation. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Agent's Immediate Environment**: The agent is facing right, but the cell directly in front (x=2, y=1) is a wall (object_type=2), blocking movement forward.\n2. **Obstacles**: The grid contains walls (x=2 column), lava (x=3-5, y=1 and y=5), and boxes (x=7 column). The agent must avoid lava and navigate around walls.\n3. **Mission Priority**: The shortest path is prioritized. Since moving forward is blocked by a wall, the agent must turn to explore alternative paths.\n\n### Action Selection:\nThe agent cannot move forward (blocked by a wall). To find a path around the wall, the agent should turn to reorient itself. Turning right (90° clockwise) will face the agent downward (direction=1), allowing exploration of cells below (y > 1) where potential paths around the wall may exist.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","\n\n\nTo solve the mission of reaching the green goal square, we analyze the grid and agent's state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Agent Position**: (1, 1), facing down (direction 1).\n- **Goal Position**: (7, 1), identified by object_type 8 (GOAL) and color 1 (GREEN).\n- **Lava**: Present at (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5) (object_type 9), which must be avoided.\n- **Obstacles**: The direct path east (right) along y=1 is blocked by lava between x=3-5. Thus, the agent must detour south (down) to bypass the lava.\n\n### Optimal Path:\n1. **Immediate Action**: The agent is facing down. Moving forward (down) to (1, 2) allows access to a safe, lava-free row (y=2) to navigate east toward the goal.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\n\nTo solve the mission of reaching the green goal square, we analyze the grid and the agent's current state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Agent Position & Direction**: The agent is at (1, 2) facing down (direction 1).\n- **Goal Location**: The green goal (object_type 8, color 1) is at (7, 1).\n- **Obstacles**: Lava (object_type 9) is present in columns x=3, 4, 5 at y=1 and y=5, blocking direct paths through these areas. Walls (object_type 2) border the grid edges (x=0, x=8, y=0, y=6).\n\n### Path Analysis:\nThe shortest path to the goal requires moving right (toward increasing x) to reach column x=7, then up (toward decreasing y) to y=1. The agent is currently facing down, so the first step is to adjust direction to face right (toward the goal).\n\n### Action Selection:\n- The agent is facing down (direction 1). To face right (direction 0), the agent must turn left (90° counter-clockwise). This aligns the agent's forward direction with the goal's x-coordinate (x=7).\n\nAnswer: turn_left","\n\n\nTo solve the mission of reaching the green goal square, we analyze the agent's position, direction, and the grid layout:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Agent Position & Direction**: The agent is at (1, 2) facing right (→).\n- **Goal Location**: The green goal (object_type=8, color=1) is at (7, 1).\n- **Immediate Obstacle**: The cell directly in front of the agent (x=2, y=2) is a wall (object_type=2), blocking movement forward.\n\n### Path Strategy:\nThe shortest path to the goal requires moving toward (7, 1), which is to the right (higher x) and slightly up (lower y) from the agent's current position. Since the agent cannot move forward (blocked by a wall), the first step is to reorient to face a direction that allows progress toward the goal.\n\n### Action Selection:\n- The agent is facing right (→). To move toward the goal (which is up and right), the agent should face up (↑) to reach y=1 (the goal's row). Turning left (counter-clockwise) from right (→) changes the direction to up (↑), aligning the agent with the goal's row (y=1).\n\nAnswer: turn_left","\n\n\nTo solve the mission of reaching the green goal square, we analyze the grid and the agent's position. The agent is at (1, 2) facing up (↑), and the green goal (object_type=8, color=1) is at (8, 1). \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Agent's Current Position and Direction**: The agent is at (1, 2) facing up, meaning the next cell in the forward direction is (1, 1).\n2. **Forward Path**: The cell (1, 1) is marked as EMPTY (object_type=1), which is safe and passable.\n3. **Immediate Action**: Since the agent is facing up and the path forward (to (1, 1)) is clear, the optimal first step is to move forward to (1, 1) to progress toward the goal.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe shortest path prioritizes moving toward the goal, and the immediate forward move is safe and unobstructed.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\nTo solve the mission of reaching the green goal square, we analyze the grid and agent's current state.

Facing up initially, the agent cannot move north (out of bounds) or west (likely a wall). Moving east is blocked by the wall at (2, 1). Thus, the agent needs to reorient to face south to explore paths south of the initial position.\n\n### Optimal Action:\nThe first step is to turn right to face east, then turn right again to face south. However, since only one action can be taken, the initial action is to turn right to start reorienting toward south.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","\nTo solve the mission of reaching the green goal square, we analyze the grid and the agent's position. The agent is at (1, 1) facing right (→), and the green goal is at (7, 1). \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Agent's Direction**: The agent is facing right, meaning moving forward will increment the x-coordinate.\n2. **Path to the Goal**: The goal is directly to the right of the agent in the same row (y=1). Checking the cells between (1, 1) and (7, 1) in row y=1, all cells (x=2 to x=6) have `object_type=1` (EMPTY), which is passable. There are no walls, lava, or obstacles blocking this path.\n3. **Shortest Path**: Since the goal is directly to the right and the path is clear, moving forward is the shortest and safest action.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe agent can move forward to proceed toward the goal.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\nTo solve the mission of reaching the green goal square, we analyze the grid and the agent's current state. The agent is at (2, 1) facing right (→). The goal is located at (7, 1) (object_type 8, color 1=GREEN). \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Direct Path Blocked by Lava**: The cells between the agent (2, 1) and the goal (7, 1) along the same row (y=1) (x=3, x=4, x=5) are LAVA (object_type 9), which must be avoided.\n2. **Alternative Path**: The agent must detour around the LAVA. The shortest safe path involves moving down to row y=2 (below the agent), then moving right along y=2 to x=7, and finally moving up to the goal at (7, 1).\n\n### Action Sequence:\n1. **Turn Right**: The agent is initially facing right (→). To move down (toward y=2), the agent must first turn right to face down (↓). This allows the agent to move into row y=2, which is clear of LAVA.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","\nTo solve the mission of reaching the green goal square, we first analyze the agent's position, direction, and the grid layout. The agent is at (2, 1) facing down (direction 1).

The cell in front (1, 1) is empty (object_type 1), making it a safe and valid path.\n\n### Optimal Action:\nThe agent must first turn right to face west (direction 2) to access the clear path westward. \n\nAnswer: turn_right","\nTo solve the mission of reaching the green goal square, we first analyze the agent's position and environment.

The direct path east (along y=1) from (2, 1) to (7, 1) is blocked by lava (object_type 9) at (3, 1), (4, 1), and (5, 1). \n\nTo avoid lava, the agent must navigate around it. Since the agent is currently facing left (west), the first step is to adjust its direction to move south (down) to bypass the lava. Turning left (counter-clockwise) from facing west (direction 2) changes the direction to south (direction 1), allowing the agent to move down into a safe path. \n\nThus, the optimal first action is to turn left to face south, enabling subsequent movement around the lava.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","\nTo solve the mission of reaching the green goal square, we analyze the grid and the agent's current state.

From (7, 2), the agent can move up to (7, 1) to reach the goal.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nThe agent is currently facing down (direction 1). The cell directly in front (2, 2) is safe (FLOOR).

To move toward the goal (which is to the right and up), the agent must first turn to face right.

No doors, keys, or lava block this initial movement.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\n\nTo solve the mission of reaching the green goal square, we first identify the agent's position and the goal location.

To reach the green goal, the shortest path involves moving right (increasing `x`) towards the goal. The immediate cell in front of the agent (facing right) is `(5, 2)`, which has `object_type=5` (KEY). Since keys are not obstacles, the path to `(5, 2)` is clear (not a wall or lava). \n\nThus, the first optimal action is to move forward into `(5, 2)` to continue progressing towards the goal.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\n\nTo solve the mission of reaching the green goal square, we analyze the grid and agent's position.

From (6, 1), the agent can then turn right to face right (→) again and move forward to reach the goal at (7, 1).\n\nThe first critical action to initiate this path is turning left to face up.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","\n\nTo solve the mission of reaching the green goal square, we analyze the grid and agent's state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Agent Position**: (6, 2), facing up (↑).\n- **Goal Position**: Identified as the cell with `object_type=8` (GOAL) and `color=1` (GREEN) at (7, 1).\n- **Path Analysis**: The agent needs to move from (6, 2) to (7, 1).

The agent is at (2, 3) facing right (→). The immediate cell in front (x=3, y=3) is FLOOR (object_type 3), which is clear. Moving forward will bring the agent closer to the door and potential keys. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","\nTo solve the mission of opening the door, the first step is to identify the door's location and its state. The agent is at position (3, 3) facing right (→). Analyzing the grid, we look for cells with `object_type=4` (DOOR). \n\nAssuming the observation is structured such that the agent is facing a door (given the mission context), the next step is to check if the door is closed (state=1) or locked (state=2). Since the agent is not carrying any objects, if the door is closed, the `toggle` action will open it. If the door were locked, the agent would need to first pick up a matching key, but there is no indication of a locked door blocking the immediate path here. \n\nGiven the mission to \"open the door\" and the agent's current orientation, the optimal action is to `toggle` the door if it is directly in front and closed. \n\nAnswer: toggle","\nTo solve the mission \"open the door,\" we first identify the door's location and state.

The agent is positioned at (3, 3) facing right (→). \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Door Location**: The grid indicates that the column at x=4 contains cells with `object_type=4` (DOOR). Specifically, the cell directly in front of the agent (facing right) is (4, 3), which is a door.\n2. **Door State**: The door at (4, 3) is closed (state likely represented as -1, corresponding to closed per the rules).\n3. **Agent Position and Orientation**: The agent is facing the closed door, satisfying the requirement to be \"facing target\" for the `toggle` action.\n\n### Action Selection:\nSince the agent is directly facing the closed door, the optimal action to open it is `toggle`.\n\nAnswer: toggle","\nTo solve the mission \"open the door,\" the agent must first identify the door's location and its state.

For doors, the `state` indicates whether it is open (0), closed (1), or locked (2). Assuming the door is closed (common for a mission requiring opening), the agent needs to use the `toggle` action to open it.

Based on the observation, the cell at (4, 3) has an object_type of 4 (DOOR). \n\nThe mission requires opening the door. For closed doors (state 1), the `toggle` action is needed. Since the agent is already facing the door (no need to move or turn), and assuming the door is closed (common for unopened doors in such scenarios), the optimal action is to toggle the door.\n\nAnswer: toggle","\nTo open the door, the agent first needs to retrieve the matching key. The mission specifies opening the door, which is identified as a locked yellow door (object_type 4, color 4, state 2) at position (5, 4). A yellow key (object_type 5, color 4) is located at (2, 4). \n\nThe agent is currently at (3, 3) facing right (→). To reach the key at (2, 4), the agent must adjust its direction to move toward the key. The key is positioned to the left and down from the agent. Since the agent is initially facing right, turning right (clockwise 90°) will make it face down (↓), allowing it to move toward the key's y-coordinate (y=4). \n\n**First action**: Turn right to face down, enabling movement toward the key. \n\nAnswer: turn_right","\nTo open the door, the agent first needs to face the door. The agent is currently at (3, 3) facing down (direction 1). The door is located to the agent's right at (4, 3).

According to the observation, this cell has `object_type=4` (door). \n- **Door State**: For doors, `state=1` indicates a closed door. While the observation lists `state=-1` for this cell (likely a formatting artifact), the mission to \"open the door\" implies this is the target door, and closed doors require the `toggle` action to open.\n\n### Action Selection:\nSince the agent is facing the closed door, the optimal action is to `toggle` it, which will open the door and complete the mission.\n\nAnswer: toggle","\nTo solve the mission of opening the door, we first identify the door's location and state.

Assuming the door is in a closed state (common for doors requiring interaction), the agent needs to use the `toggle` action to open it. Since the agent is already facing the door, no movement or rotation is needed first. \n\nAnswer: toggle","\nTo solve the mission of opening the door, the agent must first collect the matching key.

The door’s color is 4 (YELLOW).\n3. **Key Location**: A matching yellow key (object_type=5, color=4) is at (2, 4), directly to the west (left) of the agent’s current position (3, 4).\n4. **Immediate Need**: The agent must first collect the key to unlock the door. To reach the key at (2, 4), the agent needs to face west (direction 2) to move toward the key.\n\n### Action Selection:\n- The agent is currently facing down (direction 1). To face west (direction 2) (the direction of the key), the agent must turn right (clockwise 90°), as turning right from down (direction 1) changes the direction to west (direction 2).\n\nAnswer: turn_right","\nTo solve the mission of opening the door, the agent must first determine the door's state and whether a key is required.

Since the agent is facing left, the cell directly in front (x=2, y=4) contains the key, and the path is clear (no walls or lava). Moving forward allows the agent to reach the key's position.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\nTo solve the mission of opening the door, the agent must first determine the steps required based on the current observation and rules. The agent is at position (3, 4) facing left (←). The core rules emphasize avoiding dangerous areas, managing inventory, and using the shortest path. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Mission**: Open the door.\n2. **Agent State**: Not carrying anything, facing left.\n3. **Immediate Environment**: The cell directly in front of the agent (facing left) is (2, 4). Based on the observation data, this cell likely contains a key (object_type=5), as indicated by the grid entry for (2, 4). \n\n### Analysis:\n- To open a locked door, the agent needs a matching key. Since the agent is not carrying anything, the first step is to collect the key in front of it. \n- The path to the key (cell (2, 4)) is clear (no walls or lava), so the agent can move forward to reach the key.\n\n### Action:\nThe agent should move forward to reach the key, then proceed to pick it up.

The agent is positioned at (3, 4) facing left (←), and the cell directly in front of the agent (x=2, y=4) contains a yellow key (object_type=5, color=4). Since the agent is not carrying anything and the key is in the adjacent cell facing the agent, the optimal first action is to pick up the key. \n\nAnswer: pickup","\nTo solve the mission of opening the door, we first need to analyze the environment. The agent is at position (3, 4) facing left (direction 2). The mission requires opening a door, which may be closed or locked. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Door Location**: The door is identified as a cell with `object_type=4`. From the grid, the door is likely at (4, 4) (x=4, y=4), as this cell has `object_type=4` (DOOR).\n2. **Door State**: Assuming the door is closed (state 1) or locked (state 2) based on the mission context. Since the agent is not carrying a key, we first check if the door can be toggled directly (if closed).\n3. **Agent Direction**: The agent is currently facing left (direction 2). To interact with the door at (4, 4) (east of the agent), the agent needs to face east (direction 0).\n\n### Action Plan:\nThe agent must turn to face the door. Facing left (direction 2), turning right (clockwise) once changes the direction to up (direction 3), and turning right again changes the direction to east (direction 0), directly facing the door. Once facing the door, the agent can toggle it. \n\nThe first step is to turn right to start aligning towards the door.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","\nTo open the door, the agent must first face it. The agent is at (3, 4) facing up (↑). The door is located at (4, 4) (to the right of the agent's current position). To face the door, the agent needs to rotate 90° clockwise (turn right), which will align the agent's direction to the right (→), directly facing the door. Once facing the door, the agent can then toggle it open. The immediate next action required is to turn right to face the door.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","\nTo solve the mission of opening the door, we first identify the agent's position and orientation. The agent is at (3, 4) and facing right (→), meaning the cell directly in front of the agent is (4, 4). \n\nNext, we check the object type of the cell in front of the agent. From the observation, the cell (4, 4) has an object type of 4, which corresponds to a DOOR. The mission requires opening this door. \n\nFor doors, the \"toggle\" action is used to open them if they are closed (state=1) or locked (state=2, provided the agent has the matching key). Since the agent is directly facing the door and the mission is to open it, we assume the door is either closed or locked. However, the agent is not carrying any objects, so if the door were locked, the agent would need to pick up a key first. \n\nGiven the agent's position and orientation, the door is directly in front, and the optimal action to attempt opening it is to use the \"toggle\" action while facing it. \n\nAnswer: toggle","\nTo solve the mission of opening the door, we first identify the door's location and the agent's position. The agent is at (3, 4) facing right (→), and the mission requires opening a door. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Agent Position and Direction**: The agent is at (3, 4) and facing right (direction 0), meaning their forward path is along increasing x-coordinates (toward x=4, 5, etc.).\n2. **Door Location**: The door (object_type=4) is identified at (4, 4) (x=4, y=4). The state of the door is likely closed (state=1, assuming the observation’s `-1` is a typo or formatting error, as valid door states are 0=open, 1=closed, 2=locked).\n3. **Facing the Door**: Since the agent is facing right, the cell directly in front (x=4, y=4) is the door. To open a closed door, the agent must use the `toggle` action while facing it.\n\n### Action Selection:\nThe agent is already facing the closed door. The optimal action to open it is to `toggle`.\n\nAnswer: toggle","\nTo open the door, the agent must first reach a position adjacent to the door while facing it, then use the `toggle` action.

Since the agent is facing right, moving forward will take it to (4, 4), which is the next cell in the path toward the door. \n2. **Safety Check**: The cell (4, 4) is not marked as lava (9) or a wall (2), so moving forward is safe. \n3. **Immediate Action**: The first step to reach the door is to move forward to (4, 4), after which the agent will be adjacent to the door (at (5, 4)) and can then toggle it open. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","\nTo solve the mission of opening the door, the agent must first identify the door's location and its state, then take appropriate actions.

This means the cell directly in front of the agent is (5, 4).\n2. **Door Identification**: The mission requires opening a door. Based on the grid, the agent is likely positioned adjacent to a door (object_type 4). However, the door’s state (closed or locked) must be determined.\n3. **Key Presence**: The cell in front of the agent (5, 4) contains a key (object_type 5, color 4\/YELLOW).

The agent's current facing direction (right) leads to a cell with a key (object_type 5), not a door. \n\n2. **Check other directions**: The agent must face a door to interact with it. The cell directly above the agent (y=3, same x=4) is identified as a door (object_type 4). To face this door, the agent needs to rotate counter-clockwise (turn left) from its current right-facing direction, which will align it to face up (↑) towards the door.\n\n3. **Prioritize shortest path**: Turning left is the shortest action to face the door, allowing subsequent interaction (toggle) to open it.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","\nTo solve the mission of opening the door, we first need to determine the agent's position, orientation, and the location of the door.

Analyzing the grid, the agent is at position (4, 2) facing up (direction 3). \n\nKey observations:\n- The agent is not carrying any objects.\n- The blue ball must be a cell with `object_type=6` and `color=2`.\n- The agent’s current facing direction (up) means the cells directly in front are (4, 1), (4, 0), etc. The ball is not in these cells.\n\nChecking adjacent cells, the cell (4, 3) (directly below the agent) is a candidate. Since the agent is facing up, to reach (4, 3), the agent must turn to face down. Facing up (direction 3), turning right twice (90° clockwise each) will align the agent to face down (direction 1). \n\nThe first step is to initiate the turn to face the ball. The optimal first action is to turn right to start reorienting towards the ball.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","\nTo solve the mission of picking up the blue ball, we first analyze the grid to locate the blue ball (object_type=6, color=2). \n\n### Key Observations:\n- The agent is at position (4, 2) facing right (→).\n- The grid contains two balls (object_type=6) at positions (4, 3) and (6, 3), but both have color=3 (purple), not blue (color=2). Despite this discrepancy, we proceed under the assumption that the mission is valid and focus on the closest ball-like target.\n- The agent needs to move toward the ball at (4, 3) (south of the agent) to reach it. \n\n### Action Plan:\n- The agent is currently facing right (→). To move south (toward (4, 3)), the agent must first turn right to face down (direction=1).\n\nAnswer: turn_right","\nTo solve the mission of picking up the blue ball, we analyze the agent's position, direction, and the grid. The agent is at (4, 2) facing down (direction 1), meaning their forward direction is toward increasing y-coordinates (downward). \n\nFirst, we identify the blue ball (object_type=6, color=2). Checking the grid, the cell directly in front of the agent (y=3, same x=4) is (4, 3). The observation for (4, 3) indicates it contains a ball (object_type=6). Since the agent is not carrying anything and needs to be in the same cell as the ball to pick it up, the first step is to move forward into the cell with the ball.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\nTo solve the mission of picking up the blue ball, we first analyze the agent's position and the grid. The agent is at (4, 2) facing down (↓).

Scanning the grid, the only cell with object_type=6 (BALL) is at (6, 3), but it is purple (color=3). However, re-evaluating the grid, the cell (4, 3) (directly in front of the agent) has a state value of 6, which may indicate a BALL (potential data entry error). Assuming this is the blue ball (mission-critical), the agent needs to move to this cell.\n3. **Path Clearance**: The cell (4, 3) is assumed to be passable (as it aligns with the mission goal), so moving forward is feasible.\n\n### Action Selection:\nThe agent is facing down, and the immediate next step to reach the blue ball (assumed at (4, 3)) is to move forward. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","\nTo solve the mission of picking up the blue ball, we first identify the blue ball's location. The blue ball (object_type=6, color=2) is at coordinates (6, 2). The agent is at (4, 2) facing down (direction 1). \n\nTo reach the blue ball, the agent needs to move right (toward increasing x-values). Since the agent is currently facing down, turning left (90° counter-clockwise) will align the agent to face right (direction 0), allowing movement toward the ball. \n\nThe immediate next action is to turn left to face the correct direction. \n\nAnswer: turn_left","\nTo solve the mission of picking up the blue ball, we first identify the agent's position and the location of the blue ball. The agent is at (4, 2) facing right (→). The blue ball (object_type=6, color=2) is located at (6, 2). \n\nThe agent's current direction is right, so moving forward will advance towards increasing x-coordinates. The path from (4, 2) to (6, 2) is checked for obstacles:  \n- The cell immediately in front of the agent (x=5, y=2) has object_type=5 (KEY), which is not a wall or lava, so the path is clear.  \n\nThus, the first optimal action is to move forward to approach the blue ball.  \n\nAnswer: move_forward","\n\nTo solve the mission of picking up the blue ball, we first identify the agent's position and the location of the blue ball. The agent is at (4, 2) facing right (→), and the blue ball (object_type=6, color=2) is at (6, 2). \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Agent Position & Direction**: The agent is at (4, 2) and facing right, meaning moving forward increases the x-coordinate (towards higher x-values).\n2. **Blue Ball Location**: The blue ball is at (6, 2), two cells to the right of the agent.\n3. **Path Analysis**: The cells between the agent and the blue ball are (5, 2) and (6, 2). The cell (5, 2) contains a key (object_type=5), which is not a wall or lava, so the path is clear for movement.\n\n### Action Selection:\nThe shortest path to reach the blue ball is to move forward twice (from (4, 2) → (5, 2) → (6, 2)). Since the agent is currently facing right, the first step is to move forward to (5, 2).\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\nTo solve the mission of picking up the blue ball, we first analyze the observation to locate the agent and the target object. The agent is at position (4, 2) facing right (direction 0). The mission requires finding a blue ball (object_type=6, color=2). \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Agent Position and Direction**: The agent is at (4, 2) facing right (direction 0). \n2. **Ball Location**: The only balls in the grid are at (4, 3) and (6, 3), both with object_type=6 (BALL) but color=3 (purple). However, assuming potential observation formatting issues, the closest ball is at (4, 3), directly south of the agent.\n3. **Movement Requirement**: To reach the ball at (4, 3), the agent must face down (direction 1). Since the agent is currently facing right (direction 0), turning right will rotate the agent 90° clockwise to face down (direction 1), aligning them with the ball's position.\n\n### Optimal Action:\nThe first step is to turn right to face down, allowing the agent to move forward toward the ball in subsequent actions.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","\n\nTo solve the mission of picking up the blue ball, we first identify the agent's position and the location of the blue ball. The agent is at (4, 2) facing down (direction 1). The blue ball (object_type 6, color 2) is located at (6, 2). \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Agent Direction**: The agent is facing down (direction 1). To move toward the blue ball at (6, 2) (which requires moving right, increasing the x-coordinate), the agent needs to face right (direction 0).\n2. **Path to Blue Ball**: The shortest path from (4, 2) to (6, 2) involves moving right twice. This requires the agent to first turn left to face right (direction 0), then move forward twice to reach (6, 2).\n\n### Action Selection:\n- The agent is currently facing down (direction 1). Turning left (counter-clockwise 90°) will change the direction to right (direction 0), aligning the agent with the path to the blue ball. \n\nAnswer: turn_left","\nTo solve the mission of picking up the blue ball, we first need to locate the blue ball (object_type=6, color=2) in the grid. The agent is at (4, 2) facing right (→). \n\n### Key Observations:\n- The agent’s current position is (4, 2), facing right.\n- The mission is to pick up the blue ball (object_type=6, color=2).\n- Analyzing the grid, the only cells with object_type=6 (BALL) are at (4, 3) and (6, 3). However, their color (second element) is 3 (PURPLE), not 2 (BLUE). This suggests a potential data inconsistency, but we proceed under the assumption that the intended blue ball is in the agent’s vicinity.\n\n### Action Logic:\nThe agent needs to move toward the ball. Since the agent is facing right, the cell directly in front (x=5, y=2) is a key (object_type=5), not a ball. The cell south of the agent (x=4, y=3) is a ball (object_type=6), though its color is listed as purple. To reach this cell, the agent must first turn to face south (down) to move into (4, 3).\n\n### Next Action:\nThe agent is currently facing right. To face south (down), the agent should turn right (90° clockwise). \n\nAnswer: turn_right","\nTo solve the mission of picking up the blue ball, we analyze the agent's position and the grid. The agent is at (4, 2) facing down (direction 1). The cell directly in front of the agent (facing down) is (4, 3). \n\nFirst, we check the contents of (4, 3). The observation indicates this cell has an object_type of 6 (BALL) and color 3 (purple). However, the mission specifies a blue ball (color 2). Despite this discrepancy, the agent must navigate toward the ball. Since the agent is not carrying anything and the path to (4, 3) is clear (no walls or lava), the optimal first step is to move forward to reach the ball's cell. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","\nTo solve the mission of picking up the blue ball, we first identify the blue ball's location. The blue ball (object_type 6, color 2) is at coordinates (6, 2). The agent is at (4, 2) facing down (direction 1). \n\nTo reach the blue ball, the agent needs to move right (toward increasing x-values). Since the agent is currently facing down, it must first turn left to face right (direction 0). This allows the agent to move forward toward the blue ball in subsequent steps. \n\nThe first action required is to turn left to align the agent's direction with the path leading to the blue ball.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","\nTo solve the mission of picking up the blue ball, we first identify the location of the blue ball (object_type 6, color 2=BLUE). From the observation grid, the blue ball is at (6, 2) (width=6, height=2). \n\nThe agent is at (4, 2) facing right (→). Facing right means moving forward increases the width coordinate (x-axis). The path to the blue ball is clear: \n\n1. The cell directly in front of the agent (5, 2) contains a KEY (object_type 5), which is passable (not a wall or lava). \n2. Moving forward to (5, 2) is safe and necessary to approach the blue ball. \n\nThus, the first optimal action is to move forward toward the blue ball.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\nTo solve the mission of picking up the blue ball, we first identify the agent's position and the location of the blue ball. The agent is at (4, 2) facing right (→). The blue ball (object_type=6, color=2) is located at (6, 2). \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Agent's Facing Direction**: The agent is facing right, so the cells directly in front are (5, 2) and (6, 2).\n2. **Cell (5, 2)**: This cell contains a blue key (object_type=5, color=2), which is passable (not a wall). The agent can move forward into this cell.\n3. **Cell (6, 2)**: This cell contains the blue ball (object_type=6, color=2), the target of the mission.\n\n### Path Analysis:\nThe shortest path to the blue ball is straightforward: move forward from (4, 2) to (5, 2) (passing through the blue key), then move forward again to (6, 2) where the blue ball is located. Since the agent is already facing right, the first action is to move forward to reach (5, 2).\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\nTo solve the mission of picking up the blue ball, we first need to locate the blue ball (object_type=6, color=2) in the grid. Analyzing the observation, the agent is at position (4, 2) facing right (direction 0). \n\nLooking for the blue ball (object_type=6, color=2), we check the grid. The cell (4, 3) (directly below the agent) has object_type=6 (BALL) and color=3 (PURPLE) in the observation, but this is not blue. However, considering potential formatting ambiguities and prioritizing the shortest path, the agent must move toward the ball. \n\nThe agent is currently facing right (→). The ball is likely in the cell (4, 3) (down from the agent). To face down (↓), the agent needs to turn right (90° clockwise), changing direction from right (0) to down (1). After turning right, the agent can move forward into (4, 3) and then pick up the ball. \n\nThus, the first optimal action is to turn right to face the ball.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","\n\nTo solve the mission of picking up the blue ball, we analyze the agent's position, orientation, and the grid.

The mission requires finding a ball (object_type 6) with color 2 (blue). \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Agent Position and Direction**: The agent is at (4, 2) facing down. To reach the blue ball, the shortest path must be prioritized.\n2. **Ball Location**: The only ball (object_type 6) in the grid is at (6, 3), but its color is 3 (purple). However, assuming the mission specifies a blue ball (color 2), we focus on navigating to the ball's general area.\n3. **Path Planning**: The shortest path from (4, 2) to (6, 3) involves adjusting the agent's direction to face east (right) to move toward the ball. \n\n### Action Selection:\nThe agent is currently facing down. To move east (toward the ball at (6, 3)), the agent needs to turn left (counter-clockwise 90°) to face east (direction 0). This allows the agent to move forward toward the ball in subsequent steps.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","\nTo solve the mission of picking up the blue ball, we first analyze the agent's position and the grid.

To reach the ball, the agent may need to adjust its direction.\n2. **Ball Location**: The only BALL (object_type 6) in the grid is at (4, 3) (south of the agent’s current position). However, the BALL at (4, 3) has color 3 (PURPLE), not blue. Despite this discrepancy, assuming the mission refers to the available ball, the agent must move to (4, 3).\n3. **Movement Strategy**: The agent is facing right. To move south (toward (4, 3)), the agent needs to turn right (rotating 90° clockwise) to face down, then move forward into (4, 3), and finally pick up the ball.\n\n### Action Selection:\nThe first step is to adjust the agent’s direction to face down. This requires turning right. \n\nAnswer: turn_right","\nTo solve the mission of picking up the blue ball, we first analyze the grid to locate the ball. The agent is at position (4, 2) facing down (↓). The grid observation shows a cell at (4, 3) with object_type=6 (BALL). Although the problem specifies a \"blue ball,\" the only visible ball in the grid is at (4, 3). Since the agent is facing down, the cell directly in front (4, 3) is accessible (no walls or lava blocking). The first step is to move forward to reach the ball's position.

Since the agent is currently facing down (direction 1), turning left (counter-clockwise) will rotate the agent to face right (direction 0), aligning them with the blue ball's position. \n\nThe path from (4, 2) to (6, 2) is clear: the intermediate cell (5, 2) contains a key (object_type=5), which is not an obstacle, and the target cell (6, 2) contains the blue ball.

From the observation, the blue ball is at coordinates (6, 2). \n\nThe agent is at (4, 2) facing right (→). The path to the blue ball requires moving right (toward increasing x-values). The cells between (4, 2) and (6, 2) are:\n\n- (5, 2): Contains a blue key (object_type 5), which is passable (no walls, locked doors, or lava blocking the path).\n- (6, 2): Contains the blue ball (object_type 6).\n\nSince the agent is facing right, the first step is to move forward to (5, 2). This brings the agent closer to the blue ball. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","\nTo solve the mission of picking up the blue ball, we first need to locate the ball in the grid. The agent is at position (4, 2) facing right (→). The grid observation indicates that the ball (object_type 6) is at (4, 3) (same x-coordinate, y-coordinate +1). \n\nThe agent is currently facing right, but the ball is directly below (y+1 direction). To face the ball, the agent must turn right, which changes the direction to down (facing y+1). Once facing down, the agent can move forward into the cell (4, 3) where the ball is located and then perform the pickup action. \n\nThe first necessary action is to turn right to align the agent's direction with the ball's position.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","\nTo solve the mission of picking up the blue ball, we first need to identify the location of the blue ball (object_type=6, color=2) and determine the optimal path for the agent to reach it. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- The agent is at position (4, 2) and facing down (direction 1). \n- The mission requires picking up the blue ball (color=2, object_type=6). \n- The agent is not carrying any objects, so the final action to collect the ball will be `pickup`, but first, the agent must reach the ball's location.\n\n### Analysis:\nThe agent is facing down (toward increasing y-values). The cell directly in front of the agent (y+1) is (4, 3). From the observation data, the cell (4, 3) has `object_type=6` (BALL). Assuming the color of this ball is blue (color=2, as per the mission), the agent needs to move forward to reach this cell. \n\n### Action Selection:\nSince the path to (4, 3) is clear (no walls or lava blocking), the agent should move forward to reach the ball's location.

The cell directly in front (x=5, y=2) is a wall (object_type 2), blocking movement forward.\n2. **Ball Location**: The ball is at (6, 3). To reach it, the agent must adjust its direction to find a clear path.\n3. **Immediate Action**: Since moving forward is blocked by a wall, the agent must turn to explore other directions. Turning left (counter-clockwise) will change the agent's direction to up (↑), allowing it to check for a clear path upward.\n\n### Optimal Action:\nThe first step is to turn left to face up (↑), enabling the agent to explore new paths and eventually navigate toward the ball.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","\nTo solve the mission of picking up the blue ball, we first identify the blue ball's location. The blue ball has `object_type=6` (BALL) and `color=2` (BLUE). Analyzing the grid, the cell at coordinates (6, 2) has `[6, 2, -1]`, which corresponds to a blue ball (object_type=6, color=2).\n\nThe agent is currently at (4, 2) facing up (direction 3). To reach the blue ball at (6, 2), the agent needs to move right twice. Since the agent is facing up, the first step is to turn right to face the right direction (direction 0), allowing the agent to move forward toward the blue ball.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","\nTo solve the mission of picking up the blue ball, we first identify the agent's position and the location of the blue ball. The agent is at (4, 2) facing right (→), and the blue ball (object_type=6, color=2) is at (6, 2). \n\nThe agent needs to move toward the ball. Since the agent is facing right, the next cell in the forward direction is (5, 2). Checking (5, 2), the cell contains a key (object_type=5), which is not a wall (object_type=2) or lava (object_type=9), so the path is clear. Moving forward to (5, 2) is safe and brings the agent closer to the ball. \n\nThus, the optimal first action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\nTo solve the mission of picking up the blue ball, we first identify the location of the blue ball. The blue ball has `object_type=6` (BALL) and `color=2` (BLUE). From the observation grid, the blue ball is located at coordinates (6, 2) (x=6, y=2). \n\nThe agent is at (4, 2) facing right (→), meaning the agent's forward direction is towards increasing x-values. The path from the agent's current position to the blue ball is along the same y-coordinate (y=2) and requires moving right (increasing x) twice: from (4, 2) to (5, 2) to (6, 2). \n\nFirst, we check if the path is clear. The cell (5, 2) contains a key (object_type=5), which is not a wall (object_type=2) or lava (object_type=9), so it is passable. The cell (6, 2) contains the blue ball, which is also passable. \n\nThe agent’s first action should be to move forward to (5, 2) to start approaching the blue ball. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","\nTo solve the mission of picking up the blue ball, we first locate the blue ball (object_type=6, color=2) in the grid. The agent is at (4, 2) facing right (→), and the blue ball is identified at (6, 2) based on the observation data (x=6, y=2: [6, 2, -1] corresponds to object_type=6 (BALL), color=2 (BLUE)). \n\nThe agent needs to move toward the ball. Since the agent is facing right, moving forward will increment the x-coordinate. The path from (4, 2) to (6, 2) is clear (no walls or lava), requiring two \"move_forward\" actions to reach the ball's position. With 2 steps remaining, the first action should be \"move_forward\" to start closing the distance.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\nTo solve the mission of picking up the blue ball, we first identify the blue ball's location. The blue ball has an `object_type` of 6 (BALL) and `color` of 2 (BLUE). From the observation, the blue ball is at coordinates (6, 2) (x=6, y=2). \n\nThe agent is at (4, 2) and facing right (→). To reach the blue ball, the shortest path is to move forward twice: first to (5, 2), then to (6, 2). \n\nFirst, check the cell directly in front of the agent (facing right): (5, 2). The cell at (5, 2) has `object_type=5` (KEY), which is passable (not a wall or lava). Thus, the agent can safely move forward to (5, 2). \n\nThe first action to take is to move forward toward the blue ball.\n\nAnswer: move_forward"],"prompt":"\n    You are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a game board and rules.\n    Your task is:\n    - First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n    - Second, output the answer in the required format.

However, re-evaluating the mission, it is possible there may be a misinterpretation, and the goal could instead be a grey FLOOR (object_type=3) or another grey object. \n- Noting the FLOOR cells (object_type=3), the cell at (x=5, y=3) has `[3, 5, 2]`, where `color=5` (grey).

However, there are two BOXes at (2, 2) and (2, 3) with colors blue (2) and purple (3), respectively.

Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Mission**: The goal is to reach the grey box (object_type=7, color=5).\n2. **Agent State**: The agent is at position (3, 2), facing left (←), not carrying anything, with 2 steps remaining.\n3. **Grid Analysis**: The grid is a 6x6 environment. The agent’s facing direction (left) means the next cell in front is (2, 2) (x decreases by 1 when moving forward).\n\n### Critical Checks:\n- **Grey Box Location**: The problem specifies the mission is to reach the grey box. Given the grid data and constraints, the most plausible target is the cell directly in front of the agent (x=2, y=2), as it is the only viable path within the remaining 2 steps. \n- **Path Clearance**: Assuming the path is clear (no walls or lava), moving forward would bring the agent closer to the target.\n\n### Action Selection:\nThe agent is facing left, and the next cell in the forward direction is the most direct path to the grey box. With 2 steps remaining, moving forward is the optimal action to reach the target.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\nTo solve the mission of reaching the grey box, we first identify the agent's position and orientation.

To align with the key's position (which is diagonally down and left from the agent), the agent first needs to adjust its direction to face down (↓) to move toward lower y-values.

The shortest path from (4, 6) to (1, 1) involves moving west (left) and north (up). However, the agent is currently facing down (south), and the cell directly in front (y=7) is a wall (object_type 2), blocking movement. \n\n### Immediate Action:\nTo move towards the key, the agent must first adjust its direction.

To reach the key, the agent must first adjust its direction to face east (→), as the key is likely east of the agent’s current position. Turning right (clockwise 90°) from facing left (←) will rotate the agent to face north (↑). Further adjustments may be needed, but the first step is to reorient toward the key.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","\n\nTo solve the mission \"use the key to open the door and then get to the goal,\" we analyze the grid and agent's state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Agent Position**: (4, 6), facing up (↑).\n- **Mission Requirements**: Collect the key, open the locked door, then reach the goal.\n- **Key Location**: A green key (object_type 5, color 1) is at (1, 1).\n- **Door Location**: A locked green door (object_type 4, color 1, state 2) is at (5, 1).\n- **Goal Location**: The goal (object_type 8) is at (6, 6).\n\n### Path Analysis:\nThe shortest path to the key (1, 1) from (4, 6) requires moving upward (since the agent faces up) to reduce the y-coordinate.

Since the agent is facing up (↑), its current forward direction is upward (toward lower y-values). However, the key is located at (5, 1), which is to the right (higher x) and upward (lower y) relative to the agent’s position (4, 5). To reach the key efficiently, the agent should adjust its direction to face right (→) to move toward increasing x-values, aligning with the key’s x-coordinate (5).\n\n### Action Selection:\nThe agent is currently facing up (↑).

The agent is at (10, 10) facing up (↑) and needs to reach the goal. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Grid Structure**: The grid is 19x19. Based on the observation data (with state values indicating object types), the borders (x=0, x=18, y=0, y=18) are walls (state=2, object_type=2), and the inner area (x=1-17, y=1-17) is floor (state=-1, object_type=3). The agent is in the inner floor area.\n2. **Agent Direction**: The agent faces up (↑), meaning the next cell in the forward direction is (10, 9) (since moving up decreases the y-coordinate in this grid system).\n3. **Path Clearance**: The cell (10, 9) is part of the inner floor area (state=-1, object_type=3), which is empty and safe (no lava, walls, or closed doors). Thus, moving forward is possible.\n\n### Action Selection:\nThe mission requires reaching the goal, and the shortest path prioritizes moving directly toward the goal.

Since the agent is facing left, the immediate forward direction is (1, 11). Assuming the path ahead is clear (no walls, lava, or closed\/locked doors, as no conflicting observations are provided), the shortest path to the goal would involve moving forward in the current direction. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal action for the agent to reach the goal based on the given observations and core rules. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The agent is located at position (1, 11) and is facing left (direction 2, as per the AGENT's color\/direction encoding).\n- The mission is to \"reach the goal,\" so the priority is to find the shortest path to the goal while avoiding hazards.\n- The grid structure is not fully detailed, but based on typical grid environments, the agent’s immediate path must be checked for obstacles (walls, lava) to decide the next action.\n\n### Action Selection:\nThe agent is facing left (←). To proceed, we first check if moving forward (in the direction the agent is facing) is possible. Assuming the path ahead (toward x=0, y=11) is clear (no walls or lava, as implied by the problem’s focus on shortest paths), the optimal action is to move forward to progress toward the goal.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the agent's position, direction, and the grid. The agent is at (1, 11) facing left (←). The mission is to reach the goal. \n\nFirst, check the cell directly in front of the agent (facing left): (0, 11). Based on the observation data (assuming the first value in each cell represents object_type), the cell (0, 11) likely corresponds to a wall (object_type 2), as the first row (x=0) has cells with a third value of 2, which may indicate a wall. Thus, moving forward is blocked.\n\nNext, the agent must turn to find a clear path. The agent’s current direction is left (2). Turning right (clockwise) would change the direction to down (1), and turning left (counter-clockwise) would change it to up (3). Since the goal requires navigating, turning right allows the agent to face a new direction to explore potential paths. \n\nGiven the priority of shortest paths and avoiding blocked cells, the immediate action is to turn right to reorient and seek a clear path forward.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","\nTo solve this problem, we need to navigate the agent towards the goal while adhering to the core rules.

There are no immediate obstacles (lava, closed\/locked doors) blocking this path, and the shortest path to the goal (wherever it is) would start with moving forward. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the optimal action for the agent to reach the goal, following the core rules. The agent is at position (1, 10) facing up (↑) and needs to reach the goal. \n\nGiven the mission \"reach the goal\" and the requirement to prioritize the shortest path, the first step is to check the path directly in front of the agent (since the agent is facing up). Assuming the observation data (despite formatting ambiguities) indicates the path ahead is clear (e.g., FLOOR or EMPTY), the optimal action to move closer to the goal is to move forward. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","\nTo solve the problem of reaching the goal, we analyze the agent's position, orientation, and the grid structure. The agent is at (1, 10) facing up (↑), meaning the next cell in the direction of movement is (1, 9). \n\nThe observation indicates that the cells in the vertical column (x=1) from y=1 to y=17 are marked with object_type 1 (EMPTY), which is safe (not lava or walls). Since the agent is facing up and the path forward (to (1, 9)) is clear (no walls, lava, or obstacles), the shortest path to the goal (assuming the goal is in the direction the agent is facing) requires moving forward. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","\nTo solve the mission of reaching the goal, the agent must navigate the grid efficiently. The agent is located at (1, 10) and facing up (↑). The observation indicates the grid cells in the agent's path (specifically the column x=1) are primarily EMPTY (object_type=1), which is passable. Since the agent is facing up, the next immediate move in the shortest path would be to move forward into the cell (1, 9), which is clear (no walls, lava, or closed\/locked doors mentioned). There are no obstacles blocking this direction, so moving forward is safe and optimal.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\n\nTo solve the mission of reaching the goal, the agent must first determine the optimal path. The agent is at (1, 10) facing up (direction 3). The goal is likely located along the same row (y=10) towards the right (increasing x), as indicated by the grid structure (middle rows have passable cells for y=1 to y=17). \n\nSince the agent is facing up, it needs to face right (direction 0) to move towards the goal. Turning right (clockwise 90°) will adjust the agent's direction to face east (right), aligning it with the shortest path towards the goal. \n\nAnswer: turn_right","\n\nTo solve the mission of reaching the goal, the agent is positioned at (1, 10) facing right (→). The observation suggests a grid structure where the middle regions (y=1 to y=17) are likely traversable (e.g., FLOOR or EMPTY), with potential walls at the top (y=0) and bottom (y=18) edges. Since the agent is facing right, the immediate path ahead (x=2, y=10) is assumed clear (as no lava or obstacles are indicated). Prioritizing the shortest path, the optimal action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\n\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the agent's position, direction, and the mission to reach the goal. The agent is at (2, 10) facing right (→). The core rules prioritize the shortest path and avoiding obstacles. Since the observation data is truncated but no immediate obstacles (walls, lava, closed\/locked doors) are indicated, the path ahead (toward (3, 10)) is assumed clear. Moving forward aligns with the shortest path to the goal.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\n\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the mission (reach the goal), the agent's position (3, 10) facing right (→), and the observation. The agent is not carrying any objects, and 18 steps remain. \n\nThe key observation is that the agent is facing right, and the primary objective is to move toward the goal. Since there are no explicit obstacles (e.g., walls, locked doors, lava) mentioned in the truncated observation, the shortest path to the goal would involve moving forward in the direction the agent is facing. \n\nThus, the optimal action is to move forward to progress toward the goal.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\n\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the given information: the mission is to reach the goal, the agent is at (4, 10) facing right (→), and no specific obstacles (e.g., lava, locked doors) or inventory needs are mentioned. Since the agent is facing right and the mission requires moving toward the goal, the shortest path typically involves moving in the current direction if the path is clear. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","\nTo solve the problem of reaching the goal, we analyze the observation and core rules. The agent is at (5, 10) facing right (→) and needs to find the shortest path to the goal. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Grid Structure**: The grid is 19x19. Based on the observation, the borders (x=0, x=18, y=0, y=18) likely contain walls (inferred from the third element being 2, matching object_type 2=WALL). The inner area (x=1-17, y=1-17) has cells with a third element of -1, which are likely passable (e.g., FLOOR or EMPTY, object_type 1 or 3).\n2. **Agent State**: The agent is not carrying any objects, so no need for `pickup`, `drop`, or `toggle` actions. The path ahead (facing right) is in the inner passable area, with no obstacles like lava, doors, or walls blocking the immediate forward direction.\n3. **Mission**: The goal is to reach the goal square. Prioritizing the shortest path, moving forward (toward increasing x) is the optimal next step to reduce the distance to the goal.\n\n### Action Selection:\nSince the agent is facing right and the path ahead is clear (no dangerous areas or obstacles), the shortest path requires moving forward to progress toward the goal.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\n\nTo solve the mission of reaching the goal, the agent must analyze its current position, direction, and the environment. The agent is located at (6, 10) and facing right (→). The mission is to reach the goal, and the priority is to take the shortest path while avoiding hazards. \n\nThe observation grid provided, though partially truncated, suggests a structured environment. Since the agent is facing right (positive x-direction) and there are no explicit mentions of obstacles (like lava, walls, or locked doors) blocking the immediate path ahead, the optimal action to move closer to the goal is to move forward. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","\n\nTo solve the mission of reaching the goal, the agent must navigate the grid efficiently. The agent is positioned at (7, 10) and facing right (→).

Since the agent is facing right (→) and the mission prioritizes the shortest path, the immediate step is to check if moving forward (toward the right) is possible. Assuming the path ahead is clear (no walls, lava, or closed\/locked doors, as no such obstacles are indicated in the observation), the shortest path to the goal would involve moving forward. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","\nTo solve the problem of reaching the goal, the agent must analyze the environment and choose the optimal action. The agent is at (8, 10) facing right (→) and needs to prioritize the shortest path while avoiding dangers like lava. \n\nThe observation data provided is partially truncated, but key details include the agent's position, direction, and the mission to reach the goal. Since the agent is facing right, the immediate action to consider is moving forward. Assuming the path ahead (toward (9, 10)) is clear (no walls or lava, as no dangerous elements are explicitly mentioned in the observation), the shortest path would involve moving forward to progress toward the goal. \n\nOther actions like turning left\/right would delay progress, and there are no indications of doors, keys, or other obstacles requiring interaction. Thus, the optimal action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\n\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the mission (reach the goal), agent state (position (8,10), facing right, not carrying objects), and available actions. The observation grid details are partially obscured, but the core rules prioritize the shortest path and avoiding hazards. Since the agent is facing right and no immediate obstacles (lava, closed\/locked doors) are explicitly mentioned, moving forward aligns with the shortest path to the goal. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","\n\nTo solve the problem of reaching the goal, we analyze the available information. The agent is at position (8, 10) facing right (→) and needs to navigate to the goal. The observation data provided has inconsistencies (e.g., object_type 0 is undefined), but assuming the path ahead is clear (no walls, lava, or closed\/locked doors mentioned), the optimal action to prioritize the shortest path is to move forward. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","\n\nTo solve the mission of reaching the goal, the agent must navigate the grid while adhering to the core rules. The agent is currently at position (8, 10) facing right (→) and has 9 steps remaining. The observation data provided (despite potential formatting ambiguities) does not indicate immediate obstacles (e.g., lava, closed\/locked doors) in the direction the agent is facing. Since the agent prioritizes the shortest path and there are no dangerous areas or blocked paths mentioned, the optimal action is to move forward to progress toward the goal.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\n\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the mission (\"reach the goal\"), the agent's position (8,10) facing right (→), and the observation. The observation data provided is partially unclear due to formatting inconsistencies (e.g., object_type values like 0 are not defined in the rules), but key constraints apply: prioritize the shortest path, avoid dangers, and use actions from the list. \n\nSince the agent is facing right, the immediate path forward is the shortest direction to the goal (assuming no obstacles like walls, lava, or closed\/locked doors, as no such hazards are explicitly mentioned). The action \"move_forward\" aligns with the shortest path priority and is the logical next step to progress toward the goal.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\n\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the mission (\"reach the goal\") and the available information. The agent is at (8, 10) facing right (→) with 7 steps remaining. The observation grid is partially described, but key details like the goal's location or obstacles (e.g., walls, lava, doors) are not explicitly provided. Given the core rules prioritize the shortest path and assume no immediate dangers (since no lava or blocked paths are mentioned), the most logical action is to move forward to progress toward the goal. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","\n\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the given information. The mission is to reach the goal, and the agent is at (8, 10) facing right (→) with 6 steps remaining. The observation data provided appears to have formatting inconsistencies, but based on the core rules (prioritizing shortest paths and avoiding danger), the immediate action is to move forward if the path is clear. Since the agent is facing right, moving forward would advance toward the next cell, which is the shortest path direction. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","\n\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the mission (\"reach the goal\"), the agent's position (8,10) facing right (→), and the observation. The key constraints are prioritizing the shortest path and avoiding hazards. \n\nThe observation grid structure suggests the agent is in an environment where the edges are likely walls (object_type=2) and the inner area is traversable (object_type=1). Since the agent is facing right and no immediate hazards (e.g., lava) or obstacles (e.g., closed\/locked doors) are mentioned, the shortest path to the goal would involve moving in the current direction. \n\nWith 5 steps remaining, the agent should proceed along the shortest path.

The agent is at (8, 10), facing right (→), with 4 steps remaining and no items carried. The mission is to reach the goal. \n\nGiven the priority of the shortest path and the agent facing right, the immediate next step is to check if moving forward (toward the right) is possible. Assuming the cell directly in front (x=9, y=10) is clear (e.g., floor, empty, or the goal itself) and not blocked by walls, lava, or locked doors (since no keys are needed and the agent is not carrying items), the optimal action is to move forward to progress toward the goal within the remaining steps.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\n\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the mission (\"reach the goal\"), the agent's state (position (8,10), facing right, not carrying items, 3 steps remaining), and the observation. The key priorities are: shortest path, avoiding danger, and using available actions. \n\nThe agent is facing right (direction 0), and with 3 steps remaining, the shortest path to the goal likely involves moving forward if the path is clear. Since no obstacles (walls, lava, locked doors) are explicitly mentioned in the observation, and the mission requires reaching the goal quickly, the immediate action is to move forward.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\n\nTo solve the mission of reaching the goal, we analyze the given information: the agent is at (8, 10) facing right (→) with 2 steps remaining and not carrying any objects. The core rules prioritize the shortest path, and there are no mentions of obstacles (e.g., lava, closed\/locked doors) or items (e.g., keys) that would block immediate movement. With only 2 steps remaining, the optimal action is to move forward to progress toward the goal. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","\n\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the mission (\"reach the goal\"), the agent's state (position (8,10), facing right, not carrying anything, 1 step remaining), and the need to prioritize the shortest path. Since only 1 step remains, the agent must reach the goal in this step. Facing right, the next cell in the forward direction (x+1, y = (9,10)) must be the goal (object_type 8) to complete the mission.

Assuming standard rules, locked doors require a key of matching color. Since the mission specifies using a key, the door is likely locked. \n- The agent is not carrying any objects, so the first step is to find and pick up the key. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- The agent needs to face the key to pick it up. Without explicit key coordinates in the grid data, we infer the key is likely adjacent. Given the agent’s initial direction (down), turning left (counter-clockwise) would face the agent right (direction 0), aligning with the door’s position (2, 2).

The first step is to move toward the likely key location. Since the agent is facing down (direction 1), moving forward would take it to (1, 4), which is not helpful. Instead, the agent should adjust direction to face up (toward the door and potential key).  \n\n### Optimal First Action:\nThe agent needs to face up to move toward the door and key. Since the agent is currently facing down (direction 1), turning left (90° counter-clockwise) will change the direction to right (direction 0). Wait, no—direction mapping is: 0=right, 1=down, 2=left, 3=up. Facing down (1), turning left (counter-clockwise) would face right (0). Alternatively, turning right (clockwise) would face left (2). To face up (3), the agent needs to turn left twice or right twice. However, the immediate priority is to move toward the door. Since the agent is at (1, 3), facing down, the cell in front (1, 4) is empty. But the door is at (2, 2), so the agent should first move up. To face up, the agent must turn left twice (from down → right → up).

But the door is at (2, 2), which is above and to the right. To reach the door, the agent should first face up (direction 3). To face up from down, the agent needs to turn left twice (down → right → up) or turn right twice (down → left → up).

Since the agent is facing left (←), turning right (90° clockwise) will face the agent north (↑), allowing movement toward the key.\n2. **Move Toward the Key**: After turning right, moving forward will reach (1, 1) to pick up the key.\n\n### First Action:\nThe agent must first turn right to face north, enabling movement toward the key. \n\nAnswer: turn_right","\nTo solve the mission \"use the key to open the door and then get to the goal,\" the agent must first locate and collect the key, then use it to open the locked door, and finally reach the goal. \n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Agent Position and Direction**: The agent is at (1, 2) facing up (↑). \n2. **Key Requirement**: The mission requires a key to open a locked door. Based on the grid, the locked door is likely at (2, 2) (object_type=4, state=2 for locked) with color=2 (BLUE), indicating a need for a BLUE key (object_type=5, color=2).\n3. **Key Location**: The key (object_type=5) is inferred to be at (0, 2) (left of the agent’s current position). This cell is adjacent to the agent and aligns with the need for a BLUE key.\n4. **Immediate Action**: To reach the key, the agent must first turn left (counter-clockwise 90°) to face west (toward (0, 2)), allowing it to move forward to the key’s position.\n\n### Action Selection:\nThe first step is to turn left to face the key’s direction. \n\nAnswer: turn_left","\n\nTo solve the mission \"use the key to open the door and then get to the goal,\" the agent must first collect the necessary key to unlock the door. \n\n### Analysis of the Grid and Current State:\n- **Agent Position**: (1, 2), facing left (←).\n- **Mission Requirements**: Use a key to open a locked door, then reach the goal.\n- **Key Observations**: \n  - The agent is not carrying any objects (status: \"not carrying anything\").\n  - The agent is facing left (direction 2), which means the cell directly in front of the agent is (0, 2).\n  - Assuming the cell (0, 2) contains a key (object_type 5, color 2, as implied by the mission needing a key to open a door), this key is critical for unlocking the locked door.\n\n### Action Selection:\nThe first step to achieve the mission is to collect the key. Since the agent is already facing the key (cell (0, 2)), the optimal action is to use the `pickup` action to collect it. This allows the agent to then proceed to unlock the door and reach the goal.\n\nAnswer: pickup","\n\n\nTo solve the mission \"use the key to open the door and then get to the goal,\" we analyze the grid and agent state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Agent Position\/Direction**: The agent is at (1, 2) facing left (←).\n- **Mission Requirements**: Need to collect a key, use it to open a locked door, then reach the goal.\n- **Door Location**: A door (object_type=4) is at (2, 2). Its state is likely locked (state=2) based on typical mission constraints, requiring a key of matching color (color=2, BLUE).\n- **Goal Location**: The goal (object_type=8) is at (3, 3).\n- **Key Location**: The key (object_type=5) is not explicitly marked in the grid but is inferred to be in a neighboring floor cell (since the mission requires it). The most plausible location is (1, 1) or (1, 3), as these are floor cells (object_type=3) adjacent to the agent.\n\n### Action Logic:\nThe agent is facing left (←) and cannot move forward (path blocked by a wall). To reach the key (assumed in (1, 1) or (1, 3)), the agent must first reorient. Facing left, turning left (counter-clockwise) changes the direction to up (↑), allowing movement toward (1, 1) (a likely key location). This is the first step to align with the key's expected position.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","\n\n\nTo solve the mission \"use the key to open the door and then get to the goal,\" we analyze the grid and agent state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Agent Position & Direction**: The agent is at (1, 2) facing down (direction 1). The agent is not carrying any objects.\n2. **Mission Requirements**: The agent must first collect a key (object_type 5), use it to open a locked door (object_type 4, state 2), and then reach the goal (object_type 8).\n3. **Grid Analysis**: The goal is at (3, 3) (object_type 8). A door (object_type 4) is observed at (2, 2), with state 2 (locked) and color 2 (BLUE), indicating a BLUE key is required to unlock it. No key (object_type 5) is explicitly visible in the grid, but the agent must prioritize moving toward potential key locations or the door.\n\n### Action Selection:\nThe agent is facing down (direction 1). The cell directly in front (1, 3) is EMPTY (object_type 1), which is passable. Moving forward allows the agent to explore the grid, potentially locating the key or reaching the door. Since the shortest path is prioritized, moving forward is the optimal next step to progress toward the goal.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\n\n\nTo solve the mission \"use the key to open the door and then get to the goal,\" we first need to analyze the grid and the agent's current state. The agent is at position (1, 3) facing down (direction 1) and is not carrying any objects. The key steps are: (1) locate the key, (2) pick it up, (3) use it to open the locked door, and (4) navigate to the goal.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Agent Position and Direction**: The agent is at (1, 3) facing down (direction 1). Facing down means the agent’s forward movement would be toward increasing y-coordinates (e.g., (1, 4)).\n2. **Goal Location**: The goal (object_type 8) is at (3, 3).\n3. **Door and Key Requirements**: The mission specifies using a key to open a door. However, the grid does not explicitly show a key (object_type 5) in the observation. This suggests the key may be in a cell with ambiguous data (e.g., cells with `object_type=1` and `state=-1`, which could implicitly indicate a key).\n4. **Path to Key**: Assuming the key is near the agent (e.g., at (1, 2) or (1, 1), which have `object_type=1` and `state=-1`), the agent needs to reorient to face upward to reach these cells.\n\n### Action Selection:\nThe agent is currently facing down. To reach potential key locations (e.g., (1, 2) or (1, 1) above the agent), the agent must first turn to face upward. Facing down (direction 1), turning left twice (90° counter-clockwise each time) will rotate the agent to face upward (direction 3). The first step is to initiate this rotation with a `turn_left`.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","\nTo solve the mission of using the key to open the door and reaching the goal, the agent must first locate and collect the key. The agent is at (1, 3) facing right (→). Analyzing the grid, the door (object_type=4) at (2, 2) is locked (state=2) and colored blue (color=2), indicating a need for a blue key (object_type=5, color=2). \n\nThe agent’s current facing direction (right) blocks movement forward (cell (2, 3) is a wall). To reach potential key locations, the agent should adjust its direction. The cell (1, 2) (directly above the agent) is a likely candidate for the key (given the mission context). To face this cell, the agent must turn left (rotating 90° counter-clockwise), changing its direction to up (↑). This allows the agent to move forward toward (1, 2) in subsequent steps to retrieve the key.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","\n\n\nTo solve the mission \"use the key to open the door and then get to the goal,\" we analyze the grid and agent state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Agent Position**: (1, 3) facing up (↑).\n- **Mission Requirements**: Collect a key, use it to open a locked door, then reach the goal (object_type=8).\n- **Grid Analysis**: The agent is not carrying any objects. The grid contains cells with object_type=1 (EMPTY), 2 (WALL), 3 (FLOOR), 4 (DOOR), 8 (GOAL), and 10 (AGENT). Locked doors (state=2) require a matching key (object_type=5).\n\n### Critical Steps:\n1. **Locate the Key**: The agent must first find a key. Since the agent is not carrying a key, it needs to navigate to a cell with object_type=5 (key). Based on the grid, cells with state=-1 (e.g., (1, 2)) are likely key positions (as they are empty but marked for interaction).\n2. **Navigate to the Key**: The agent is facing up (↑), and the cell directly in front (y=2, x=1) is a wall (object_type=2). To reach the key (likely at (1, 2)), the agent must turn left to face west (←), allowing movement toward the key.\n\n### Action Selection:\nThe first step is to turn left (90° counter-clockwise) to face west, enabling the agent to move toward the key in subsequent steps.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","\nTo solve the mission of using the key to open the door and reach the goal, we analyze the environment as follows:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Agent Position**: At (1, 3) facing left (←).\n- **Mission Requirements**: Need a key to open a locked door, then reach the goal.\n- **Goal Location**: Identified at (3, 3) (object_type=8).\n- **Door Analysis**: The door (object_type=4) is likely at (2, 2) (inferred from context, as it is a critical path node). Assuming it is locked (state=2) and requires a key of matching color (e.g., blue).\n- **Key Location**: The cell (1, 2) (object_type=1, state=-1) is inferred to be the key (likely a typo or misrepresentation in the grid, as the mission requires a key).\n\n### Action Plan:\n1. **Turn Right**: The agent is facing left (←). To move toward the key at (1, 2), the agent needs to face up (↑). Turning right (clockwise) from left (←) changes the direction to up (↑).\n2. **Move Forward**: After turning up, the agent can move forward to (1, 2) to reach the key.\n3. **Pickup**: Collect the key at (1, 2).\n4. **Proceed to Door**: Turn right again to face right (→), move to the door (2, 2), toggle to open it, then move to the goal.\n\nThe first critical action is to adjust the agent's direction to face up, enabling access to the key. \n\nAnswer: turn_right","\n\n\nTo solve the mission \"use the key to open the door and then get to the goal,\" we analyze the grid and agent state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Agent Position & Direction**: The agent is at (1, 3) facing up (↑).  \n- **Goal**: Located at (3, 3) (inferred from state=8 on a FLOOR cell).  \n- **Door**: Likely at (2, 2) (object_type=2\/WALL but state=4, suggesting a door; common in grid layouts).  \n- **Key**: The cell directly in front of the agent (facing up) is (1, 2), which has object_type=1 (EMPTY) but color=2 (BLUE).

Since the agent is not carrying any keys and needs to open locked doors (which require matching keys), reorienting to explore the environment is a critical first step.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","\n\nTo solve the mission of opening the red door then the blue door, we first need to locate the red door and the required red key, as locked doors require a matching key. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Agent Position**: At (6, 1), facing up (↑).\n- **Red Door**: A locked door (object_type=4, color=0 (RED), state=2 (locked)) is likely at (4, 0) (inferred from grid data).\n- **Red Key**: A key (object_type=5, color=0 (RED)) is at (5, 0) (inferred from grid data).\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Move to the Red Key**: The agent needs to reach (5, 0) to pick up the red key. From (6, 1) facing up, moving forward first reaches (6, 0), then turning left (to face left) and moving forward reaches (5, 0).\n2. **Pick Up the Red Key**: Once at (5, 0), use the `pickup` action to collect the key.\n3. **Open the Red Door**: With the red key, move to (4, 0) (the red door) and use `toggle` to unlock and open it.\n\n### First Action:\nThe agent is at (6, 1) facing up. The first step is to move forward to (6, 0) to start heading toward the red key. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","\n\n\nTo solve the mission of opening the red door then the blue door, we first analyze the agent's current state and environment. The agent is at position (6, 1) facing up (direction 3). The grid observation indicates the agent is not carrying any objects, and the mission requires interacting with doors (object_type=4). \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Agent Position and Direction**: The agent is at (6, 1) facing up. The cell directly in front (y=0) is likely a wall (object_type=2), blocking movement forward.\n2. **Immediate Actions**: Since moving forward is blocked, the agent must reorient to explore the environment. Turning right (90° clockwise) will change the agent's direction to face right (direction 0), allowing exploration of adjacent cells.\n3. **Mission Priorities**: The next step is to reorient to identify the positions of the red and blue doors (object_type=4, colors 0 and 2, respectively) and any required keys (object_type=5). Turning right is the first step to scan the environment for these critical objects.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","\n\n\nTo solve the mission of opening the red door then the blue door, the agent must first collect the red key (required to unlock the red door). Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Agent Position & Direction**: The agent is at (6, 1) facing right (→).\n- **Red Door**: A locked red door (object_type=4, color=0, state=2) is present (likely at (4, 0) based on grid patterns).\n- **Red Key**: A red key (object_type=5, color=0) is located at (5, 0) (inferred from grid data).\n- **Path to Red Key**: The agent needs to reach (5, 0) to pick up the red key. The shortest path involves turning left (to face up) to navigate toward the key.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nThe agent is currently facing right. To reach the red key at (5, 0), the first step is to turn left (rotating 90° counter-clockwise) to face up (direction 3). This aligns the agent with the path needed to move toward the key.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","\n\n\nTo solve the mission \"open the red door then the blue door,\" the agent must first locate and collect necessary keys (if doors are locked) and navigate to the doors. The agent is at (6, 1) facing up (↑) and not carrying any objects. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Mission Requirements**: Open a red door first, then a blue door. Locked doors require matching keys (pickup first), and closed doors require toggling.\n2. **Agent Position & Direction**: Agent is at (6, 1), facing up (↑). Facing up means the agent’s forward direction is toward decreasing y-coordinates (toward the top of the grid).\n3. **Immediate Environment**: The cell directly in front of the agent (facing up) is (6, 0). Based on the observation data, this cell does not appear to be a door, key, or obstacle, but the agent may need to reorient to reach keys or doors.\n4. **Key Priorities**: Since the agent is not carrying any keys, the first step is likely to locate and collect a red key (for the red door) and\/or a blue key (for the blue door). Assuming keys are in the grid, the agent needs to navigate toward them.\n\n### Action Selection:\nThe agent is facing up but may need to reorient to access keys or doors. Turning left (counter-clockwise) from facing up will make the agent face left (←), allowing movement toward lower x-coordinates (leftward), which may lead to keys or doors. \n\nAnswer: turn_left","\n\nTo solve the mission of opening the red door then the blue door, we first analyze the agent's position, orientation, and the grid layout. The agent is at (6, 1) facing left (←). The key steps involve navigating toward the doors, checking for obstacles, and ensuring the correct sequence of actions.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Agent Position & Orientation**: The agent is at (6, 1) facing left (←), meaning the direction of movement is toward decreasing x-coordinates (leftward).\n2. **Mission Requirements**: The mission requires opening a red door followed by a blue door. This implies the agent must first locate these doors, potentially collect keys if they are locked, and use the `toggle` action to open them.\n3. **Grid Analysis**: The grid contains cells with object types, colors, and states. Cells with `-1` in the state are assumed to be traversable (e.g., FLOOR or EMPTY). The agent’s immediate path to the left (x=5, y=1) is likely clear (as indicated by `-1` in the state), allowing movement.\n\n### Action Selection:\nSince the agent is facing left and the path directly in front (x=5, y=1) is clear, the optimal first step is to move forward to progress toward the doors. This aligns with prioritizing the shortest path and avoiding dangerous areas (no lava observed).\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\n\nTo solve the mission of opening the red door then the blue door, the agent must first secure the necessary keys and navigate to the doors. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Agent Position & Direction**: The agent is at (5, 1) facing left (←). \n- **Mission Requirements**: Open a red door followed by a blue door. Locked doors require matching keys (red key for red door, blue key for blue door).\n- **Key Locations**: A red key (object_type=5, color=0) is located at (5, 0) (directly above the agent’s current position at (5, 1)).\n- **Immediate Need**: The agent is not carrying any keys, so the first step is to retrieve the red key.\n\n### Action Plan:\n1. **Turn to Face the Key**: The agent is currently facing left (←). The red key is directly above (y=0), which requires facing up (↑). To face up from left, the agent must turn left (90° counter-clockwise), changing direction to up (↑).\n2. **Move to the Key**: After turning left, the agent faces up. Moving forward will take it to (5, 0), where the red key is located.\n3. **Pick Up the Key**: Once at (5, 0), the agent can pick up the red key.\n\n### First Action:\nThe immediate step is to turn left to face up, enabling the agent to move toward the red key.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","\n\n\nTo achieve the mission of opening the red door then the blue door, the first step is to collect the red key needed to unlock the red door. The agent is currently at (5, 1) facing down (direction 1). The red key is located at (5, 0), directly north of the agent. To move toward the key, the agent must first face north (direction 3). Since the agent is facing down (direction 1), turning left once will change the direction to right (direction 0), and a second left turn will face the agent north (direction 3). The immediate next action is to initiate this rotation by turning left.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","\nTo solve the mission of opening the red door then the blue door, the agent first needs to navigate towards the doors. The agent is currently at (5,1) facing right (→). Observing the grid, moving forward (to (6,1)) is possible as the path is clear (assumed FLOOR). This initial movement helps the agent progress towards potential door locations. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","\n\n\nTo solve the mission of opening the red door then the blue door, we first analyze the grid to identify the positions of the doors and keys. The agent is at (6, 1) facing right (→) and is not carrying any objects. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Agent Position and Direction**: The agent is at (6, 1) facing right. The immediate cell in front (7, 1) is empty (path clear).\n2. **Door Identification**: Doors are object_type=4. Scanning the grid, the only valid doors identified are:\n   - At (3, 2): [3, 2, 4] → likely a blue door (color=2, as color=2 corresponds to blue).\n   - At (8, 4): [8, 4, 4] → color=4 (yellow), not relevant to the mission.\n3. **Red Door**: No red door (color=0) is explicitly identified in the grid, but the mission prioritizes opening red first, suggesting a red door may be along the path.\n4. **Path Optimization**: The shortest path to reach the blue door (3, 2) requires moving down to (6, 2) (since (6, 1) facing right leads to a wall at (8, 1)), then left towards (3, 2).\n\n### Action Selection:\nThe agent is facing right, and the immediate path forward (7, 1) is clear. However, to reach the blue door, the agent should first adjust its path. Since the agent is facing right and the next cell (7, 1) is empty, moving forward is safe and part of the shortest path to explore the environment.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\n\n\nTo solve the mission of opening the red door then the blue door, the agent must first collect the red key to unlock the red door, then toggle the blue door. \n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Agent Position and Direction**: The agent is at (7, 1) facing down (direction 1, as color=1 for AGENT indicates direction down).\n2. **Red Door**: Located at (4, 0), object_type=4 (DOOR), color=0 (RED), state=2 (locked). Locked doors require a matching key.\n3. **Red Key**: Located at (5, 0), object_type=5 (KEY), color=0 (RED). The agent must pick up this key to unlock the red door.\n4. **Blue Door**: Located at (4, 2), object_type=4 (DOOR), color=2 (BLUE), state likely closed (state=-1, inferred as closed). Closed doors require toggling to open.\n\n### Path Planning:\nThe agent needs to navigate to the red key at (5, 0). The agent is currently blocked by obstacles (BOX at (7, 0), BALL at (6, 1)) when facing down. To reach the red key, the agent must first reorient to face right (direction 0) to move toward (8, 1), a passable GOAL cell.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nThe agent is facing down (direction 1). To face right (direction 0, which allows movement toward (8, 1)), the agent must turn left (counter-clockwise 90°). \n\nAnswer: turn_left","\n\n\nTo solve the mission \"open the red door then the blue door,\" the agent must first locate and interact with the doors. The agent is at (7, 1) facing up (direction 3). Analyzing the grid, the priority is to identify doors (object_type=4) and their states (closed\/locked). \n\nThe observation data is ambiguous, but focusing on the mission, the agent needs to navigate toward the doors. Since the agent is not carrying anything, if a closed or locked door is in front, the agent must first obtain a key (if locked) or toggle (if closed). However, with 6 steps remaining, the immediate action depends on the agent's current facing direction. \n\nAssuming the path forward (facing up) is clear, the agent should move to approach the doors. If blocked, turning may be needed. Given the ambiguity, the most logical next step is to move forward to progress toward the doors.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\n\nTo solve the mission of opening the red door then the blue door, we first need to locate the red door and the required red key. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Agent Position & Direction**: The agent is at (7, 1) and facing down (direction 1, as per the grid’s color value for the agent).\n2. **Red Door**: A locked red door (object_type 4, color 0, state 2) is at (4, 0).\n3. **Red Key**: A red key (object_type 5, color 0) is at (5, 0).\n\n### Path Planning:\nTo reach the red key at (5, 0), the agent must first adjust its direction to move west (left) toward (5, 0). Since the agent is initially facing down (direction 1), turning right (clockwise 90°) will face it west (direction 2), allowing it to move toward the key.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nThe first step is to turn right to face west, enabling movement toward the red key.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","\nTo solve the mission of opening the red door then the blue door, the agent must first retrieve the red key (required to open the locked red door) and then interact with the doors. \n\n### Analysis:\n- **Agent Position & Direction**: The agent is at (7,1) facing right (→) with 4 steps remaining.\n- **Red Door**: Located at (4,0) (object_type=4, color=0 (red), state=2 (locked)).

The first step is to turn left to face up, initiating the reorientation toward the key.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","\n\n\nTo solve the mission of opening the red door then the blue door, we first need to analyze the environment and the agent's current state. The agent is at position (7, 1) facing up (↑) and is not carrying any objects. The mission requires opening a red door followed by a blue door, which likely involves retrieving keys (since locked doors require matching keys) and using the `toggle` action.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Agent Position and Direction**: The agent is at (7, 1) facing up. The cell directly in front (up) of the agent (7, 0) is a BOX (object_type=7), which is an obstacle, blocking movement forward.\n2. **Immediate Obstacles**: The cells adjacent to the agent (up, down, left) are blocked by BOX or BALL objects, leaving only the right direction (x-increasing) as a potential path.\n3. **Shortest Path Priority**: To reach the red key (required for the red door) and subsequent doors, the agent must first reorient to move in a clear direction.\n\n### Action Selection:\nThe agent cannot move forward while facing up (blocked by a BOX). The optimal first step is to turn right (90° clockwise) to face right (direction 0), which allows movement into the next cell (8, 1), identified as a FLOOR\/GOAL (passable).

Assuming the key is in an accessible cell (e.g., (1, 1) or (1, 3), common empty cells), the agent must navigate to it.

Assuming the key is in the cell directly in front of the agent (since the grid’s structure suggests the key is likely in (1, 1), as it is the only cell with a non-standard state (-1) and is adjacent to the agent’s starting position), the first step is to move forward to reach the key.\n\n### Action Selection:\nThe agent should move forward to (1, 1) to reach the key. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","\n\n\nTo solve the mission \"use the key to open the door and then get to the goal,\" the agent must first locate and collect the key, then use it to open the locked door, and finally reach the goal.

Agent Position and Initial State\n- The agent is at (1, 1) facing up (direction 3).\n- The agent is not carrying any objects.\n- The grid observation indicates the goal is likely at (3, 3) (object_type 8), and there is a door (object_type 4) at (2, 2) (state 2, implying it is locked).\n\n### 2. Key Location\nThe mission requires a key to open the locked door. The only plausible cell for the key is (1, 2) (south of the agent), as it is marked as [1, 2, -1] (EMPTY, but likely contains the key given the mission context).\n\n### 3. Path to the Key\nThe agent is facing up. To reach (1, 2) (south), the agent needs to face down. Facing up (direction 3), turning right twice (90° clockwise each) will orient the agent downward (direction 1). The first step is to turn right to begin reorienting toward the key.\n\n### 4.

The goal is at (3, 3) (object_type=8).\n\n### Action Prioritization:\n- The agent needs to face the key to move toward it. Since the agent is initially facing left (←), the key is likely below (y=2) at (1, 2).

Adjacent cells to the agent:\n   - Up: (1, 0) is a wall (object_type 2).\n   - Left: (0, 1) is a wall (object_type 2).\n   - Right: (2, 1) is a door (object_type 4).\n   - Down: (1, 2) is a floor (inferred from `-1` as a placeholder for FLOOR\/EMPTY), which is the only viable direction to move.\n\n### Action Logic:\nThe agent needs to move down to (1, 2) to reach the key (assumed to be in this cell, as it is the only accessible adjacent non-wall cell). To face down (required to move to (1, 2)), the agent must turn around from its current upward facing direction. The fastest way to face down from up is to turn left twice (up → left → down). The first step is to initiate this rotation.\n\n### First Action:\nThe agent starts facing up. The first action to begin rotating toward down is to `turn_left`, which changes the direction to left (counter-clockwise 90°). Subsequent actions will continue rotating and moving, but the initial step is to turn left.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","\n\n\nTo solve the mission \"use the key to open the door and then get to the goal,\" we analyze the grid and agent state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Agent Position**: (1, 1), facing left (←).\n- **Mission Requirements**: Collect a key, use it to open a locked door, then reach the goal.\n- **Key Location**: Assuming the key is in the cell directly in front of the agent (x=0, y=1), as the mission requires a key and the grid likely contains one here (object_type 0 may be a typo for 5, representing a key).\n- **Locked Door**: The door at (4, 1) (object_type 4, color 1 (GREEN), state 2 (locked)) matches the expected green key.\n- **Goal**: Located at (3, 3) (object_type 8).\n\n### Action Plan:\n1. **Move Forward**: The agent is facing left (toward x=0, y=1).

Here's the analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Key and Door\nThe mission requires a key to open a locked door. From the grid observation, the agent is at (1, 1) facing up (↑). The locked door is likely at (2, 1) (inferred from the grid data, where the cell [2, 1, 4] suggests a door-like structure). This door is locked (state=2) and green (color=1), so a green key (object_type=5, color=1) is needed. \n\n### Step 2: Locate the Key\nThe green key is likely in the cell to the agent's left (x=0, y=1). To reach this key, the agent must first turn left to face the key's direction.\n\n### Step 3: Initial Action\nThe agent is currently facing up (↑). To face the key at (0, 1) (left of the agent), the agent must rotate 90° counter-clockwise (turn left).

A door (object_type 4) is likely at (2, 1) (in the agent’s rightward path if facing left, assuming typical grid structure). Locked doors require a matching key (object_type 5).\n\n### Action Logic:\n- The agent is facing left (←). To progress toward the key (likely in the leftward path) and eventually the door\/goal, the first step is to check if moving forward (toward (0, 1)) is possible.

A green key (color=1) is required to unlock it.\n- **Goal**: Located at (3, 3) (object_type=8).\n- **Inventory**: The agent is not carrying anything, so the green key must be picked up first.\n\n### Action Prioritization:\n1. **Find the Key**: The mission requires a green key to unlock the door. Since the key’s exact position is not explicitly visible in the grid data, the first step is to reorient the agent to explore potential key locations.\n2. **Reorient to Explore**: The agent is currently facing left (direction 2). To access areas where the key might be (e.g., right, down, or up), the agent should turn right to face down (direction 1), allowing movement toward the door and adjacent cells.\n\n### Optimal Action:\nThe agent needs to turn right to face down (direction 1), enabling movement toward the door and potential key locations. \n\nAnswer: turn_right","\n\n\nTo solve the mission \"use the key to open the door and then get to the goal,\" we analyze the grid and agent state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Agent Position**: (1, 1), facing up (↑).\n- **Mission Requirements**: Collect a key, use it to open a locked door, then reach the goal.\n- **Grid Analysis**: \n  - The agent is not carrying any objects, so the first step is to find and pick up a key.\n  - The goal (object_type=8) is likely at (3, 3) based on the observation data.\n  - A locked door (object_type=4, state=locked) is likely present (e.g., at (2, 1) based on the grid structure).\n  - The key (object_type=5) must be in an adjacent cell.

Locked doors (object_type 4, state 2) are present, requiring a key of matching color. The key (object_type 5) is not explicitly visible in the observation, but the agent must first locate and pick it up.\n\n### Action Logic:\nThe agent is facing up (↑) and needs to navigate toward the key (assumed to be in an adjacent cell). Since the agent cannot move forward immediately (potential obstacles), turning right (to face right →) allows reorientation to explore other directions where the key or door might be located. This reorientation is the first step toward aligning with the key or door.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","\n\n\nTo solve the mission \"use the key to open the door and then get to the goal,\" we analyze the grid and agent state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Agent Position and Direction**: The agent is at (1, 1) facing right (→).

Locked doors require a matching key to open.\n   - The agent needs to collect a key (object_type=5) to unlock the door. Given the grid constraints and limited steps (3 remaining), the key is likely in the agent’s immediate vicinity.\n\n### Action Prioritization:\nSince the agent is not carrying a key and needs one to unlock the door, the first critical step is to pick up the key. Assuming the key is in the agent’s current cell or adjacent (as no other clear key positions are visible in the grid), the optimal immediate action is to `pickup` to collect the key.\n\nAnswer: pickup","\nTo solve the mission of using the key to open the door and reaching the goal, the agent must first locate and collect the key.

The agent is at (1, 4) facing left (←). The door is identified at (5, 4) with object_type 4 (DOOR), color 4 (YELLOW), and state 2 (locked). However, no yellow key (color 4) is observed in the grid, suggesting the door might be closed (state 1) or the state data may be misformatted. Regardless, the agent must first face the door to interact with it.\n\nThe agent is currently facing left (direction 2). The door is to the right (higher x-coordinate) of the agent. To face the door, the agent needs to turn right twice to face right (direction 0). The first step is to rotate 90° clockwise (turn_right) to face down (direction 1), then another turn_right to face right (direction 0). \n\nGiven the immediate need to reorient toward the door, the first action should be to turn right.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","\nTo solve the mission of opening the door, we first identify the door's location and state. The door is at (5, 4) with object_type=4 (DOOR), color=4 (YELLOW), and state=2 (locked). A locked door requires a matching key (yellow, color=4) to open. \n\nNext, we check for the presence of a yellow key. The only key in the grid is at (3, 1) with object_type=5 (KEY) and color=1 (GREEN), which does not match the door's color. However, the immediate priority is to face the door to eventually interact with it (if possible). \n\nThe agent is currently at (1, 4) facing up (↑). The door is to the right (x increases) of the agent. To face the door, the agent needs to turn right (90° clockwise), changing direction from up (3) to right (0). \n\nThus, the first action is to turn right to align towards the door's direction.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","\nTo solve the mission of opening the door, the agent must first navigate to the door and interact with it. The agent is currently at (1, 4) facing right (→) and cannot move forward due to a wall blocking the path. The first step is to adjust the agent's direction to find a clear path. \n\nThe agent's initial direction is right, but the cell directly in front (x=2, y=4) is a wall (object_type=2). To proceed, the agent needs to turn to face a new direction where movement is possible. Turning right (clockwise 90°) will make the agent face down (direction=1), allowing movement to the cell (1, 5), which is empty (object_type=1) and passable. \n\nThus, the optimal first action is to turn right to reorient and explore a new path towards the door.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","\n\n\nTo solve the mission \"open the door,\" we first need to identify the door's location and its state, then determine the necessary actions to interact with it. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Agent Position and Direction**: The agent is at (1, 4) and facing down (direction 1, where direction 1 corresponds to \"down\").\n2. **Door Identification**: The door (object_type=4) is observed at (5, 4) based on the grid data. For doors, state 2 indicates \"locked,\" meaning it requires a matching key to open.\n3. **Key Requirement**: A locked door requires a key of the same color. The door at (5, 4) has color 4 (YELLOW), so a yellow key (object_type=5, color=4) is needed.\n4. **Key Location**: A yellow key is observed at (3, 1) (object_type=5, color=4, state=0).\n\n### Action Plan:\nThe agent must first retrieve the yellow key to unlock the door. However, the agent is currently facing down (toward (1, 5)) and needs to reorient to move toward the key. \n\n### Immediate Action:\nThe agent is not yet facing the key or the door. The first step is to turn to face the correct direction to navigate toward the key. Since the agent is facing down (direction 1), turning left (direction 3, \"up\") or right (direction 0, \"right\") would adjust their orientation. However, the key is to the right (higher x-coordinate) of the agent, so turning right to face right (direction 0) would align the agent toward the key and door.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","\nTo solve the mission of opening the door, the agent first needs to navigate to the door and then interact with it. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Agent Position and Direction**: The agent is at (1, 4) facing left (←). The mission is to open the door.\n2. **Door Location**: The door (object_type=4) is identified at (5, 4) based on the grid data.\n3. **Path to the Door**: The agent is currently facing left (away from the door, which is to the right at higher x-values). To reach the door, the agent must first face right (towards the door).\n\n### Action Selection:\nThe agent is facing left (←). To face the door (to the right), the agent needs to rotate 180 degrees. The shortest way to do this is by turning right twice (each turn is 90° clockwise). The first step in this rotation is to `turn_right`, which changes the agent's direction to down (↓) initially. Subsequent actions will continue adjusting the direction, but the immediate next action is to start rotating toward the door.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","\nTo solve the mission of opening the door, we first need to identify the door's location and its state, then determine the necessary steps to open it. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Agent Position and Direction**: The agent is at (1, 4) facing up (↑). This means the agent’s forward direction is toward decreasing y-values (e.g., (1, 3), (1, 2), etc.).\n2. **Door Identification**: The mission requires opening a door. From the grid, the door is likely at (5, 4) (object_type=4), but its state (closed\/locked) needs confirmation. Assuming it is closed or locked, the agent must reach it and interact.\n3. **Path to the Door**: The agent is currently facing up. To reach the door at (5, 4), the agent needs to navigate toward it. Since the agent is facing up, moving forward first (to (1, 3)) is the initial step to reorient or proceed toward the door.\n\n### Action Selection:\nThe shortest path to the door starts with moving forward to (1, 3) to reposition. This allows the agent to then turn right (facing right) and move toward the door’s x-coordinate (5). \n\nAnswer: move_forward","\nTo solve the mission of opening the door, we first need to identify the door's location and its state. Analyzing the grid observation, we look for cells with `object_type=4` (DOOR). \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Agent Position and Direction**: The agent is at (1, 3) facing up (↑). \n2. **Door Identification**: Scanning the grid, the door is identified at coordinates (5, 4) with `object_type=4` (DOOR). The door's state is not explicitly clear from the observation, but assuming standard door states (0=open, 1=closed, 2=locked), we proceed under the assumption that it is closed (state 1) and requires toggling to open.\n3. **Path to the Door**: The agent needs to face the door to toggle it. Given the agent's current position (1, 3) and direction (up), we need to determine if the door is in the agent's line of sight or if the agent needs to reorient.\n\n### Action Selection:\nThe agent must first confirm if it is facing the door. If the door is directly in front of the agent, the optimal action is to `toggle` it. Based on the grid layout and the agent's direction, the door at (5, 4) is not immediately in front, but given the mission to open the door, the first step is to interact with the door once aligned. However, since the door's exact position relative to the agent is not fully clear, the most logical initial action to open the door (assuming it is within interaction range) is to `toggle`.\n\nAnswer: toggle","\nTo solve the mission of opening the door, the agent first needs to analyze the environment and determine the optimal path. The agent is located at (1, 3) facing up (↑) and needs to reach a closed door to toggle it open. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Agent Position and Direction**: The agent is at (1, 3) facing up (direction 3). The cell directly in front (facing up) is (1, 2), which is empty (object_type 1), so moving forward is possible.\n2. **Door Location**: The doors are identified as object_type 4, located in column x=4 (observed in the grid data for x=4). To reach these doors, the agent needs to navigate towards column x=4.\n3. **Immediate Action**: Since the agent is facing up and the path forward (to (1, 2)) is clear, the first step is to move forward to get closer to the door area.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe agent should move forward to (1, 2) to start navigating towards the door. \n\nAnswer: move_forward","\nTo solve the mission of opening the door, we first need to identify the door's location and state, then determine the necessary actions. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Agent Position and Direction**: The agent is at (1, 2) and facing up (↑).\n2. **Door Identification**: The door (object_type=4) is critical. From the observation, a door is present at (5, 4) with color 4 (YELLOW) and state 2 (locked). Locked doors require a matching key to open.\n3. **Key Identification**: A key (object_type=5) is present at (3, 1) with color 1 (GREEN). However, the door is locked and yellow, so a yellow key is needed. No yellow key is observed, suggesting potential ambiguity or a focus on a closed (not locked) door.\n4. **Immediate Action**: Assuming the mission focuses on a closed door (state=1) that the agent can directly interact with, the agent must face the door to toggle it open.\n\n### Action Selection:\nSince the mission is to \"open the door,\" and the agent needs to interact with the door, the optimal action is to toggle it if facing a closed door. Given the context, the agent is likely positioned to toggle a closed door.\n\nAnswer: toggle","\nTo solve the mission of opening the door, we first need to identify the door's location and state. The agent is at (1, 2) facing up (↑). Analyzing the grid, the door is identified at (5, 4) with object_type=4 (door), color=4 (YELLOW), and state=2 (locked). A locked door requires a matching key (color 4, YELLOW) to open. \n\nNext, we check for keys (object_type=5) in the grid. The only key observed is at (3, 1) with color=1 (GREEN), which does not match the door's color (YELLOW). However, the mission is to \"open the door,\" implying the door may be closed (state=1) or the key is accessible. Since the agent is not facing the door and no door is adjacent, the first step is to reorient to move toward the door. \n\nThe agent is currently facing up (↑). To move toward the door at (5, 4) (which is to the right and down from the agent's position), the agent should face down (↓) to move in the direction of increasing y. This requires turning right twice (90° clockwise each time) to face down. The first action is to turn right to start reorienting.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","\nTo solve the mission of opening the door, we first need to analyze the grid and the agent's current state. The agent is at position (1, 2) facing right (→) and is not carrying any objects. The goal is to open a door, which requires either toggling a closed door (if facing it) or using a key to unlock a locked door (after picking up the key).\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Agent Position and Direction**: The agent is at (1, 2) facing right. The cell directly in front (east) is a wall (object_type=2), blocking movement forward.\n2. **Door Location**: Doors (object_type=4) are present in the grid, particularly in the column x=4 (e.g., (4, 2) is a door). These doors may be closed (state=1) or locked (state=2).\n3. **Key Location**: A key (object_type=5, color=1 (GREEN)) is located at (3, 1). If a door is locked (e.g., a green door), this key would be necessary to open it.\n4. **Path Obstacles**: The wall at x=2 (object_type=2) blocks direct east movement from the agent's current position. To reach the doors or the key, the agent must navigate around this wall by moving north (up) or south (down).\n\n### Action Plan:\nSince the agent is blocked by a wall when facing right, the first step is to reorient to find a path around the wall. Moving north (up) from the agent's current position (1, 2) to (1, 1) is a viable direction, as (1, 1) is empty (object_type=1). To face north, the agent must turn left (90° counter-clockwise), changing its direction from right (→) to up (↑).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe optimal first action is to turn left to face north, allowing the agent to move toward the key or door in subsequent steps.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","\nTo solve the mission of opening the door, the agent must first locate the door and determine if it requires a key.

However, the agent is currently facing left, and the immediate path to the right (toward higher x-values) is blocked by walls (object_type 2). \n\n### Action Plan:\nThe first step is to reorient the agent to face a direction that allows movement toward the key and eventually the door. Since the agent is facing left (direction 2), turning right will reorient it to face up (direction 3), which is a clear path (the cell (1, 1) is empty).

To reach the key at (3, 1), the agent needs to adjust its direction to move toward the key.\n\n### Action Selection:\nThe immediate step is to pick up the key. However, the agent is not yet in front of the key. Since the problem prioritizes the shortest path and avoiding dangers, the first action should be to move toward the key. But based on the observation data and the need to interact with the door, if the door is directly in front and closed (not locked), toggling would open it. Given the ambiguity in the grid data but assuming the door is closed and in front, the optimal action is to toggle.\n\nAnswer: toggle","\n\n\nTo solve the mission of opening the door, we first identify the door and its state. The observation shows a locked door (object_type=4, state=2) at (x=4, y=0) with color 0 (RED). Locked doors require a matching key (color 0, RED), which is located at (x=5, y=0) (object_type=5, color=0). \n\nThe agent is at (4, 3) facing down (direction 1). To reach the red key at (5, 0), the shortest path involves:  \n1. Turning left to face right (direction 0), allowing movement toward x=5.  \n2. Moving forward to reach x=5.  \n3. Adjusting direction to face up (direction 3) to move toward y=0.  \n4. Picking up the red key.  \n5. Returning to the door and toggling it open.  \n\nThe first critical action is turning left to face right, enabling progress toward the key.  \n\nAnswer: turn_left","\n\n\nTo solve the mission of opening a door, we first analyze the grid and the agent's position. The agent is at (4, 3) facing right (→) and is not carrying any objects. The goal is to open a door (object_type 4).\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Agent's Position and Direction**: The agent is in a column (x=4) where all cells (except the agent's position at y=3) are doors (object_type 4). The agent faces right (toward x=5), where the cell in front is a key (object_type 5), not a door.\n2. **Door Locations**: Doors are in the same column (x=4) as the agent, spanning y=0 to y=5. The agent is at (4, 3), so adjacent doors are at (4, 2) (north) and (4, 4) (south).\n3. **Door State**: The problem specifies that doors have states: 0 (open), 1 (closed), or 2 (locked). The observation shows doors at y=0 and y=5 have state 2 (locked), while others (y=1, 2, 4) have state -1 (assumed to be closed, as invalid states likely indicate closed doors).\n4. **Action Priorities**: The shortest path to open a door requires facing the door directly. Since the agent is not currently facing a door (facing right), the first step is to turn to face an adjacent closed door.\n\n### Optimal Action:\nThe agent needs to face a closed door. The adjacent closed doors are at (4, 2) (north) and (4, 4) (south). Facing south (y=4) requires turning right (90° clockwise), which aligns the agent with the door at (4, 4). This is the shortest path to face a closed door and prepare to toggle it.\n\nAnswer: turn_right","\nTo solve the mission of opening the door, we analyze the agent's position, direction, and the grid environment:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Agent Position and Direction**: The agent is at (4, 3) facing down (direction 1, where \"down\" means the agent's forward direction is toward increasing y-coordinates).\n- **Door Location**: The cell directly in front of the agent (facing down) is (4, 4). Checking the grid, this cell has `object_type=4` (DOOR). \n- **Door State**: For doors, the state values are: 0=open, 1=closed, 2=locked. Although the observation lists the state as `-1` (likely a placeholder), the mission implies the door needs opening, so we infer it is closed (state 1).\n\n### Action Justification:\nSince the agent is facing the closed door (at (4, 4)), the required action to open it is `toggle` (as per the rules: \"Closed doors require 'toggle' to open\").\n\nAnswer: toggle","\nTo solve the mission of opening the door, we first need to identify the door's location and the agent's current orientation. The agent is at position (4, 3) and facing down (direction 1). \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Door Identification**: The door (object_type=4) is likely in the agent's immediate vicinity. Given the grid structure and the agent's position, the cell directly in front of the agent (facing down) is (4, 4). \n2. **Door State**: Assuming the door at (4, 4) is closed (state=1) or locked (state=2), the agent needs to interact with it. Since the mission is to \"open the door,\" the door is likely closed or locked.\n3. **Agent Orientation**: The agent is already facing down, which aligns with the direction of the door (assuming the door is at (4, 4)). \n\n### Action Selection:\nTo open a closed door, the agent must use the `toggle` action while facing the door. Since the agent is facing down (toward (4, 4)) and assuming the door is in this direction, the optimal action is to `toggle` the door.\n\nAnswer: toggle","\n\nTo solve the mission of opening the door, we first identify the door's location and state. The agent is at (4, 3) facing down (direction 1), meaning the cell directly in front is (4, 4). \n\nAnalyzing the observation grid, the cell at (4, 4) has an `object_type` of 4 (DOOR). For doors, the state indicates whether it is open (0), closed (1), or locked (2). Assuming the state value `-1` in the observation is a typo or misrepresentation, we infer the door is closed (state 1) since the mission is to \"open the door.\" \n\nThe agent is already facing the door (facing down, directly towards (4, 4)), so no rotation is needed. To open a closed door, the required action is `toggle`.\n\nAnswer: toggle","\nTo solve the mission of opening the door, we first need to determine the agent's current position and orientation, then identify the door's location and state. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Agent Position & Orientation**: The agent is at (4, 3) and facing down (↓). This means the agent's forward direction is toward increasing y-coordinates (e.g., from (4, 3) to (4, 4)).\n- **Mission**: Open the door. Doors (object_type=4) require the `toggle` action if closed (state=1) or locked (state=2). Locked doors need a matching key (object_type=5) to unlock.\n\n### Analysis:\nThe agent is not carrying any objects, so if the door is locked, a key must be picked up first. However, based on the observation, the agent is directly facing a door (likely at (4, 4) in the forward direction). Assuming this door is closed (state=1), the agent can open it by using the `toggle` action while facing it.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the agent is facing the door and the mission is to open it, the optimal action is to `toggle`.\n\nAnswer: toggle","\nTo solve the mission of opening the door, we first identify the door's location and state. The agent is at (4, 3) facing down (direction 1), and the observation indicates a door (object_type 4) directly in front of the agent at (4, 4).

Since the agent is not carrying any objects, we prioritize checking if the door is closed (not locked).\n2. **Agent Position and Direction**: The agent is facing down (toward increasing y-values). The cell directly in front of the agent (y+1) is (4, 4). Assuming this cell contains a closed door (state 1), the agent can interact with it by toggling.\n3. **Action Selection**: To open a closed door, the `toggle` action is required when facing the door. Since the agent is positioned to face the door, the optimal action is to toggle it.\n\nAnswer: toggle","\nTo solve the mission of opening the door, we analyze the grid and the agent's state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Agent Position and Direction**: The agent is at (4, 3) facing down (direction 1). Facing down means the agent's forward direction is toward increasing y-values (i.e., the cell directly in front is (4, 4)).\n2. **Door Location**: The cell (4, 4) has `object_type=4` (door) based on the observation grid. \n3. **Door State**: For doors, `state=1` indicates a closed door (requires `toggle` to open). Assuming the door at (4, 4) is closed (as locked doors require a key, and no key is needed here), the agent can interact with it by toggling.\n4. **Facing the Door**: The agent is directly facing the door at (4, 4), satisfying the requirement for using `toggle`.\n\n### Optimal Action:\nSince the agent is facing the closed door, the correct action to open it is `toggle`.\n\nAnswer: toggle","\nTo solve the mission of opening the door, we first identify the agent's position and orientation. The agent is at (4, 3) facing down (direction 1), meaning their forward direction is toward (4, 4). \n\nNext, we analyze the grid to locate the door. The door has an object_type of 4. The cell directly in front of the agent, (4, 4), has an object_type of 4 (DOOR). Since the mission is to open a door, and the agent is facing this door, the next step is to check if the door is closed (state 1) or locked (state 2). \n\nAssuming the door in front (4, 4) is closed (common for doors requiring toggling), the agent can interact with it using the `toggle` action. The agent does not need a key for a closed door (only locked doors require keys), and since the agent is already facing the door, the `toggle` action is valid.\n\nAnswer: toggle","\nTo solve the mission of opening the door, the agent must first determine the door's location and state, then retrieve any necessary key, and finally interact with the door. \n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Door Identification**: The grid indicates the agent is at (4, 3) facing down (direction 1). The door (object_type=4) is likely in front of the agent at (4, 4) (since the agent faces down, moving forward would target (4, 4)). \n2. **Door State**: Assuming the door at (4, 4) is locked (common for doors requiring keys), the agent needs a key of matching color. \n3. **Key Location**: A key (object_type=5) is located at (5, 4) (x=5, y=4), which is to the right and slightly down from the agent's current position. \n4. **Path to Key**: The agent is facing down (direction 1). To reach the key at (5, 4), the agent should first turn left to face right (direction 0), allowing movement toward the key.\n\n### Action Selection:\nThe first step to reach the key is to turn left, reorienting the agent to face right (direction 0). This allows subsequent movement toward the key at (5, 4).\n\nAnswer: turn_left","\n\n\nTo solve the mission of opening the door, we analyze the grid and rules as follows:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Agent Position & Direction**: The agent is at (4, 3) facing right (→).\n- **Door Location**: A door (object_type=4) is identified at (5, 4) with color=4 (YELLOW) and state=2 (locked). Locked doors require a matching key to open.\n- **Key Location**: A key (object_type=5) is present at (5, 3) (directly in front of the agent, facing right). This key’s color is not explicitly specified, but since the agent needs to collect a key to open the locked door, retrieving this key is the first step.\n\n### Action Logic:\n1. **Move Forward**: The agent is facing right, and the cell directly in front (5, 3) contains a key (not a wall or lava). Moving forward allows the agent to reach the key.\n2. **Pickup Key**: After moving to (5, 3), the agent can pick up the key to unlock the door.\n3. **Navigate to Door**: After collecting the key, the agent would need to adjust direction (e.g., turn right to face down) and move to (5, 4) to toggle the door. However, the immediate priority is to reach the key.\n\nThe first critical action is to move forward to reach the key, as it is required to unlock the door.\n\nAnswer: move_forward","\nTo solve the mission of opening the door, we first need to identify the door and determine the necessary actions.

Specifically, the cell at (4, 4) (x=4, y=4) has `object_type=4`, indicating it is a door. \n2. **Door State**: The door at (4, 4) likely has a state of 1 (closed) (assuming the `-1` in the observation is a formatting error, as valid door states are 0=open, 1=closed, 2=locked). \n3. **Agent Direction**: The agent is currently facing right (→). To interact with the door at (4, 4) (directly below the agent), the agent needs to face down (direction 1). \n\n### Action Plan:\n- The agent must first turn right (90° clockwise) to face down (direction 1), aligning with the door at (4, 4). \n- Once facing the door, the agent can then use the `toggle` action to open it. \n\nThe immediate next action is to turn right to face the door. \n\nAnswer: turn_right","\nTo solve the mission of opening the door, we first identify the door's location and the agent's position\/direction.
