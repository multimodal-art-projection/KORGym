Since there are only 3 steps remaining, the key must be on our way to the goal, or at least nearby.\n\nThe observation shows a door at (3, 3) and the agent is at (3, 2) facing down. So the agent is facing the door.\nSince there are only 3 steps, and the door is locked, we need to find a key quickly. But there is no key in sight. This looks like an unsolvable problem with the given number of steps.\nHowever, since the agent is already facing the door, the best action is 'toggle'.\nLet's try moving forward first.\n\nAnswer: move_forward"],"prompt":"\n    You are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a game board and rules.\n    Your task is:\n    - First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n    - Second, output the answer in the required format.

(11, 11) facing left.\n- The goal location is not explicitly provided in the abbreviated observation, however the get_action function is written to move towards the goal.\n- Since the agent is facing left (agent_dir = 2), the get_action function determines the appropriate action based on relative positions.\n\nIn this specific case, based on the default behavior of the `get_action` function and given that dx and dy are unknown the best course of action is `move_forward`.\n\nAnswer: move_forward\n","```python\ndef extract_grid_from_observation(observation):\n    \"\"\"Extracts the object type

The agent is at (8, 11) facing up. The mission is to get the blue key from the yellow room, unlock the blue door, and go to the goal. We have 26 steps.\n\nFirst, we need to locate the blue key and the yellow room, the blue door and the goal. By visually inspecting the grid (which is not fully provided but we can still infer information), we need to find a path to the yellow room, get the key, then find the blue door, unlock it, and finally reach the goal.\n\nSince we are facing up, let's start by turning left. Then we will move forward to explore the location.\n\nAnswer: turn_left","```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the grid navigation problem.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Initial state\n    agent_x = 8\n    agent_y = 11\n    agent_direction = 2 # left\n\n    # Mission: get the blue key from the yellow room, unlock the blue door and go to the goal\n\n    # Actions to take:\n    # 1.

The mission is to get the blue key from the yellow room, unlock the blue door, and go to the goal. The agent has 8 steps remaining.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the environment.

The blue door is assumed to be further to the right, and finally, the goal after the blue door.\n\nWith the limited steps, the agent needs to move directly to the key and pick it up.\n\nmove_forward\nAnswer: move_forward","```python\ndef solve():\n    # Initial analysis of the environment is necessary for a good solution.\n    # Since we have the full grid, let's implement a basic pathfinding to\n    # the key, then the door, then the goal.\n    #\n    # The agent is at (10, 10), facing right.\n    # The mission is: 'get the blue key from the yellow room, unlock the blue door and go to the goal'\n    # We have 7 steps.
