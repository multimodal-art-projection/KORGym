Since 20 is quite far from 33 and you want to be as close as possible without going over, it makes sense to take at least one more card rather than standing with 20. Therefore, based on the situation, your best decision is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 29 and the threshold of 33, standing is the optimal move. If you hit, only drawing an Ace (1), 2, 3, or 4 will keep your total within the threshold. Drawing any card from 5 to King (value 5–13) will bust you, which happens with a probability of 9\/13 (about 69%). Standing, on the other hand, locks in your 29 versus an opponent whose total (even at its maximum) will be much further from the threshold. Therefore, standing guarantees a win in this round.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current round details—your cards sum to only 11 against a high threshold of 39 and with the opponent showing only a 3—it’s statistically very low risk to take another card. With so much room before reaching the threshold, hitting is the optimal choice to try to get closer to 39 without busting. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, look at the facts:\n\n• The threshold (N) is 39.\n• You have a total of 19 (cards 6, 5, and 8).\n• The opponent (dealer) shows a face‐up 3 and a hidden card that, even at its maximum value (13), gives a total of at most 3 + 13 = 16.\n• In this game, if both sides finish without exceeding N, the one whose total is closer to 39 wins. With your current total, the “gap” is 39 – 19 = 20, and even if the opponent has the best‐case total of 16 (gap 23), you win.\n• You’re already in a winning position by standing, and there is no benefit to taking extra risk with additional (“hit”) cards.\n\nThus, the correct move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation, you currently have a total of 18 while the threshold is a high 46. In the previous rounds the opponent always stood with a very low total, regardless of the threshold. Their visible card this round is only 2, and since they follow the same fixed strategy, it is likely they will not hit and will remain with a relatively low score. \n\nMeanwhile, with 18 points you are far from the threshold and have plenty of room to build a higher total. Given that you need to beat your opponent’s likely low score (and also close the sizable gap towards 46), the optimal decision is to hit and aim for a higher total without risking a bust (since even a maximal draw value of 13 would only take your total to 31, which is still safe). \n\nThus, your best move in this turn is to request an additional card: Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the analysis:\n• Your current total is 22, while the opponent’s known card is 2 and his hidden card is drawn uniformly from the deck (with values 1–13). His final total will lie between 3 and 15.\n• The settlement is determined by which side is closer to the threshold (46). With a total of 22 your difference is 46 – 22 = 24, while the opponent’s best possible total (even if high) would yield a difference no less than 46 – 15 = 31.\n• Since you already have a winning edge and there is no benefit to increasing your total (except risking a bust on subsequent hits), the optimal move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given our current total of 20 compared to the threshold of 28, we already have a comfortably higher total than what the opponent can achieve with only one known card (a 5) and an unknown card that, even at maximum value, cannot get beyond 18. If we stand with 20, the opponent’s best total (5 + 13 = 18) still falls short when measured by closeness to 28. Hitting risks busting—since any card of 9 or more (5 out of 13 possibilities) would put us over 28—without any potential upside in beating the opponent’s likely total. With this strong relative position, the best move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Let's review the situation in Round 5:\n\n• You have 7 and K, so your total is 7 + 13 = 20.\n• The threshold (N) is 24.\n• The opponent shows an 8, with a hidden card you don’t yet know.\n• In previous rounds the opponent always stood immediately with his two cards.\n \nIf you stand at 20, your outcome will depend on the opponent’s hidden card. When the opponent’s two cards total 8 + X (with X uniformly one of the 13 possible card values), his total will range from 9 to 21. Comparing distances from the threshold:\n – Your distance: 24 – 20 = 4.\n – Opponent’s distance: 24 – (8 + X) = 16 – X.\nA brief evaluation shows that if X is 13 (total 21), his distance is 3, beating your 4. If X is 12 (total 20), you tie (both are 4 away). For any X ≤ 11 (totals 9–19), his distance exceeds 4, so you win. This gives:\n Win probability: 11\/13,\n Draw probability: 1\/13,\n Loss probability: 1\/13,\nwith an expected score of (11\/13 × 1 + 1\/13 × 0.5) ≈ 0.8846.\n \nNow, if you choose to hit, you risk busting. Since your current total is 20 and the threshold is 24, you can only safely take a card with a value of 4 or less. There are 4 safe outcomes out of 13 (values 1, 2, 3, or 4), while 9 out of 13 cards would bust you immediately. Even if you hit and obtain a safe card (resulting totals 21, 22, 23, or 24), the expected outcome improves only marginally compared to what you already have with a safe 20—but at the risk of busting 9\/13 of the time. A brief calculation shows that even when playing optimally after a safe hit, your overall expected score would be around 0.305, much lower than standing with 20.\n\nGiven these assessments, the best play is to avoid the substantial bust risk and simply stand on 20.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation, you have a very low total (13) relative to the threshold (50) while your opponent always stops with just his two starting cards (whose total is at most 18). Although you must be cautious of busting when approaching 50, right now there is no risk at all—a hit will only add between 1 and 13 points. Since your opponent’s fixed strategy means he will not improve his hand any further, you have every reason to aggressively improve your total. In order to come closer to 50 and thereby secure a win (remember, if both sides stay under 50 the one with the higher total wins because that total is closer to 50), your best move is to request an additional card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, here’s the reasoning:\n\n• The threshold is 50, so busting (going over 50) is not an immediate worry given your sum.\n• Your current cards are ['4', '9', 'K'] which total 26.\n• The opponent shows a 5, and because in previous rounds the opponent always stood on their initial two cards, it is very likely they will keep their hidden card and not hit. That means the opponent’s total will be 5 plus a card whose value can be at most 13 (if it’s a K) — so their total is at most 18.\n• In the settlement, if neither side busts, the higher total (i.e. the one closer to the threshold of 50) wins.\n• With your total at 26 compared to at most 18 for the opponent, you are already in a very favorable position.\n• Hitting further could increase your total and get you even closer to 50, but it also adds the risk of busting in later rounds. Since your current 26 already outstrips the opponent’s likely total, the safest and optimal decision in this round is to stand.\n\nThus, you should choose “stand.”\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current round, you only have 20 points while the threshold is 41. Even if you draw the highest card (13 points), you’d only reach 33, which is still safe. In every previous round the opponent has taken no additional hits (they always stood immediately), meaning that regardless of the hidden card their final total is simply 8 plus that unknown value. Although there is some chance that the opponent’s hidden card gives them a closer total to 41, you’re very far from the threshold yourself. With an infinite deck where every card (Ace through King) is available with equal likelihood, you have little to fear busting as long as you aren’t too near 41. Moreover, by hitting you can steadily improve your total to be closer to 41 than your opponent’s expected range. \n\nThus, the optimal move now is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round, the threshold (N) is 41 and your current total is 32. Your opponent’s visible card is 8 and because the opponent always stands with his initial cards (as shown in all previous rounds), his total will be 8 plus his hidden card. Since even the highest card (K = 13) would give him at most 21, his total is guaranteed to be lower than your current total if you stand. \n\nIf you choose to hit, any safe card (1–9) will improve your total (ranging from 33 to 41), but there is a risk: if you draw 10, J, Q, or K (values 10, 11, 12, or 13), you’ll exceed 41 and immediately lose. In an infinite deck with equal probabilities for each card rank, the chance of drawing a safe card is 9\/13 and the chance of busting is 4\/13. Although drawing a safe card always puts you in a winning position (because your total will be closer to 41 than any outcome the opponent can have), the risk of busting (losing immediately) makes hitting less favorable than standing.\n\nSince standing with 32 guarantees a win (32 is closer to 41 than any possible opponent total), the best move in this situation is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current round the player’s total is 15, which is far from the threshold of 49. In all previous rounds the opponent has simply stood with just their initial two cards—even if that total was low—and does not take any extra cards. Since the opponent’s fixed strategy is to stand with the two-card total (and their face-up card is a K worth 13, with the unknown card averaging around 7, roughly 20 in total), you have a clear advantage by trying to improve your hand. With 15 points, you have a wide margin (34 points remaining before busting) and can safely hit to try for a higher total that is closer to 49. A higher total puts you more likely to win since if both sides are under 49, the side closest to 49 wins. \n\nThus, the optimal move in this situation is to request an additional card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, your current total (23) is much lower than the threshold (49), and the opponent’s sum (with a known K showing 13 plus an unknown card) will be at most 26. Since the opponent’s strategy is to stand immediately, if you were to stand now your total of 23 would be far from 49 compared to the opponent and you would almost certainly lose the round. \n\nWhen you choose to hit, any card from 1 to 13 added to 23 will produce a safe total (ranging from 24 to 36) because even with the maximum value (13), you reach exactly 36 which is still well below the threshold. With 36 you would already be ahead of any opponent sum (which is at most 26), and you would be in a strong position. Moreover, the rules let you take subsequent hits if needed so that you can push your total higher—remember that none of the additional draws will accidentally put you over 49 as long as your running total is kept low enough. \n\nIn short, to maximize your chance of ending up with a total closer to 49 than the opponent’s (and there is no risk of busting at this moment), the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our analysis, our current total is 32. The opponent’s two‐card total (with their known K worth 13 plus a hidden card between 1 and 13) will always be between 14 and 26. Since the settlement rule is determined by who is closer to the threshold N (here 49), even if we stand at 32 the gap from 49 is 17 while the opponent’s gap is at least 23. In other words, if we do not take any further cards our total remains 32, which is already closer to 49 than any possible opponent total.\n\nAlthough hitting would safely add between 1 and 13 to our total (yielding values between 33 and 45) without the possibility of busting on one hit, it isn’t necessary because our current total guarantees a win. Furthermore, any additional risk is unnecessary when victory is already assured.\n\nThus, the optimal move in this round is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the analysis, your current total is 21 and the threshold is 29. If you stand now, your total is 21 while the dealer’s known face‐up card is a J (11) and their hidden card is uniformly likely to be any value from 1 to 13. In that case the dealer’s total (11 plus the unknown card) will be:\n • 12 (if the hidden card is 1) → difference from 29 is 17,\n • 13 → difference 16,\n • 14 → difference 15, …,\n • 20 → difference 9,\n • 21 (if the unknown card is 10) → difference 8 (a draw),\n • 22 → difference 7,\n • 23 → difference 6,\n • 24 → difference 5.\nSince winning is determined by whose difference from the threshold (29) is smaller—and with equal totals it’s a draw—the outcome when you stand with 21 works out as follows:\n – You win if the dealer’s hidden card is among 1–9 (9‐out of‐13 chance);\n – It’s a draw if the dealer’s card is 10 (1‐out‐of‐13 chance);\n – You lose if the dealer’s card is J, Q, or K (3‐out‐of‐13 chance).\nThat gives an expected round score of approximately 0.73.\n\nIf you choose to hit with 21, you add a card. However, since the threshold is 29, you only “survive” a hit if the drawn card is 8 or below. There’s a 8\/13 chance of not busting and a 5\/13 chance of busting immediately. Even in the safe cases, the modest improvement in your total (ranging from 22 up to a perfect 29) isn’t enough to overcome the risk; a quick dynamic programming analysis shows that the expected outcome if you hit would be even lower (around 0.59) than if you stand.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation, your current total is 16 (from a 5 and a J) while the threshold is 39. Notice that in every round so far your opponent has simply stood after being dealt two cards. Their visible card is a 5 and their unknown card is drawn from an infinite deck (with an average value of about 7), giving an expected total around 12. However, since the settlement is determined by which hand is closer to the threshold (without going over 39) and your opponent is not drawing any extra cards in this round, you have plenty of “room” to improve your total.\n\nYour hand’s value of 16 is far from 39, so the best plan is to try to get your total closer to the threshold. This means you should request an additional card (“Hit”) in order to have a better chance of beating your opponent when both totals are compared.\n\nThus, your move should be to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the analysis of the current round:\n\n• Your hand totals 28 (5 + 11 + 12) and the threshold is 39.\n• The opponent’s visible card is 5 and their hidden card, drawn from an infinite deck, will give them a total between 6 and 18, which is well below 28.\n• If you hit, you risk drawing a 12 or 13 (with probability 2\/13) that would make your total exceed 39 and cause you to bust.\n• On the other hand, standing at 28 guarantees a win in this round because your total is significantly closer to 39 than any possible total the opponent can have with two cards.\n\nThus, the safest and optimal strategy in this situation is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

If you choose to Hit, you have a roughly 9\/13 chance (about 69%) of drawing a card that does not bust your hand (i.e. card value of 9 or less) and a 4\/13 chance (about 31%) of busting. Since a safe card (1–9) will on average add about 5 (bringing you to around 20, a much stronger position against 24), and because ending this round with only 15 will likely lose if your opponent improves their score, it is advisable to Hit now. \n\nAnswer: Hit","In this round:\n• Your total is 17 (from cards 6, 9, 2) and you’re under the threshold of 24.\n• The opponent’s visible card is an Ace (worth 1), and their hidden card is unknown. Their total is 1 plus an unknown value, meaning their final total can only be between 2 and 14.\n• When neither side exceeds 24, the winner is determined by which total is closer to 24. Your difference is 24 – 17 = 7, while the opponent’s difference will range from 10 (if they get 13 making their sum 14) upward. Even in their best-case scenario (sum of 14, difference 10), your total of 17 is closer to 24.\n• Though you could try to hit for a higher total, hitting comes with the risk of drawing a card that will exceed the threshold (only safe if the drawn card is 7 or lower, with a 7\/13 chance) – and you already have a guaranteed win by standing.\n \nThus, the optimal decision is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current round, your total is only 12 while the threshold is 49—a very high limit that makes busting extremely unlikely. In contrast, leaving 12 on the table would almost certainly be too low compared to what your opponent might eventually reach. With plenty of room to hit without fear of busting, and since every extra point gets you closer to the winning number, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that the threshold N is 49 and you currently have only 17 points, there is a large margin before you risk exceeding 49. In a round where getting closer to 49 increases your chance to win and the opponent’s fixed strategy already involved standing on their first turn, it is optimal for you to draw another card. Therefore, your move should be to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round, your cards total 24 while the threshold is 49. Since none of your cards will push your total over 49 when added (even the highest value, 13, would bring you to 37), you have plenty of room to improve your hand. Meanwhile, your opponent is showing a King (worth 13) and is playing a fixed strategy in which they stand on their turn. With such a high threshold and ample “safe” room, the best strategy is to take another card (Hit) to try and get as close to 49 as possible without busting.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is 35 and the threshold is 49. Since the maximum possible card value is 13 (and 35 + 13 = 48, which is still under the threshold), there is no risk of busting on this hit. Also, given that the opponent’s visible card is a King (value 13) and they have already chosen “stand” in every turn so far, their final total will be relatively low (between 14 and 26). By hitting you have the opportunity to get closer to 49, thus increasing your chance to outdistance the opponent on settlement.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Let's analyze the situation:\n\n• Our total is 41 and the threshold is 49. Our remaining “room” is 8 points.  \n• A safe hit would require drawing a card of value 8 or less. From the 13 possible card values (A=1, 2, 3, …, 10, J=11, Q=12, K=13), 8 values (A through 8) would keep us safe, and 5 (9, 10, J, Q, K) would bust us. That gives a safe probability of 8\/13 ≈ 61.5%.\n• However, note the opponent’s situation: his visible card is K (13) and his other card is unknown. Although his unknown card can be any value (giving him a total between 14 and 26), his fixed strategy is to always stand. This means that regardless of his unknown card, his total will be much lower than ours if we stand with 41.\n• By standing at 41, we win automatically: with a threshold of 49, our opponent’s maximum total is at most 26, meaning our difference from 49 (which is 8) is much lower than his (which is 23 or more).\n• If we hit, even though a safe hit (with probability ≈61.5%) would improve our total (making it closer to 49), the risk of busting (with probability ≈38.5%) is too high, because busting means an instant loss. \n\nTherefore, the optimal move in this round is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation, here’s the reasoning:\n\n• Your current total is 19 (cards: K = 13, 6 = 6).\n• The opponent’s face‐up card is 5 and his hidden card is unknown. Since cards come from an infinite deck of values {1, 2, …, 10, 11 (J), 12 (Q), 13 (K)}, the hidden card can be at most 13. Thus, the opponent’s maximum possible total is 5 + 13 = 18.\n• From the history it appears that the opponent’s fixed strategy is to stand immediately (as seen in previous rounds). Even if for some reason the opponent were to hit, his total starting from only two cards couldn’t exceed yours if you simply stood with 19.\n• Since standing with 19 will always beat an opponent who ends up with a total of 18 or less under the current rules, taking another card (Hit) only adds risk without any benefit.\n\nThus, your best move for Round 3 is to stand immediately.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation, here’s our reasoning:\n\nWe have a current total of 15 (with cards 9 and 6) and the game threshold is 29. In comparison, the opponent shows a 4 and has a hidden card. From the previous rounds, we observe that the opponent’s fixed strategy has been to stand immediately, so it is very likely they will not take any extra cards. Their final total will likely be 4 plus the value of the unknown card. (Since cards come from an infinite deck with uniform probability for Ace (1), 2–10, and face cards J=11, Q=12, K=13, the opponent’s total could be any number from 5 to 17.)\n\nIf we stand with 15, we win only if the opponent’s total is less than 15 (which happens if their hidden card is between 1 and 10) and draw if it’s exactly 15 (hidden card = 11), while we lose only if the opponent’s card is 12 or 13. That gives us roughly a win probability of 10\/13, draw 1\/13, and lose 2\/13.\n\nHowever, our current total of 15 is far from the threshold of 29 and we have a wide margin. Also, when hitting, note that even drawing the highest card (K=13) would give us a total of 15 + 13 = 28, which is still below 29. Therefore, hitting is risk‐free at this stage and gives us the opportunity to get closer to 29—improving our chance to beat the opponent’s likely low final total.\n\nThus, the optimal move is to ask for another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the current round, your total is 24. If you choose to hit, you risk drawing a card that is 6 or higher. Since 24 + any card 6 or above would exceed the threshold of 29, drawing a hit has a 8\/13 chance to bust. On the other hand, standing immediately gives you 24, and your opponent – who always stands – will have a total between 5 (if they get a 1 with the known card 4) and 17 (if they get a 13), ensuring that your 24 beats their total. Therefore, your best move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on our analysis of the current round, your total is 17 while the dealer shows a 6 (with an unknown card already dealt). In previous rounds the dealer’s fixed strategy has been to stand immediately so that his hand is simply 6 + (unknown card), meaning his total lies between 7 and 19. If you were to stand now with your 17, your winning chances would come only when the dealer’s total is lower than 17 (a roughly 10\/13 chance win, plus a small tie chance), giving you an expected value of about 0.81 (win = 1, draw = 0.5, loss = 0).\n\nHowever, because you are far from the threshold of 40 and you cannot bust by taking one additional card (your new total would range from 18 to 30), you can safely hit. Dynamic programming shows that if you hit from 17 you will almost always end up with a total of 18 or higher. In fact, once you reach 18–19 you can even choose to hit further since the dealer’s maximum is 19 (assuming you get to at least 20 you guarantee a win because the dealer’s possible totals are all lower). Detailed computation shows that the expected outcome from hitting is an expected score of 1 whereas standing gives an expected score of about 0.81.\n\nThus, the optimal play on turn 1 with a total of 17 is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the current situation in Round 5, your total is 21. The opponent’s shown card is a 6 and the face‐down card is unknown, but because the opponent always stands and only has two cards, their total will be 6 plus a card value between 1 and 13 (i.e. between 7 and 19). Since the game is decided by who is closer to the threshold (40) without exceeding it, your difference from 40 is 19 (40 – 21) while the opponent’s difference will be at least 21 (if they have 19, 40 – 19 = 21). This means that if you stand now, no matter what your opponent’s hidden card is, your total of 21 is guaranteed to be closer to 40 than theirs.\n\nAlthough you could hit to get a higher total, you already have a winning hand because even the worst-case opponent total (19) is still further from 40 than your 21. Hitting carries additional risks in later turns if you try to reach even closer to 40. Therefore, the optimal move in this round is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current round, your cards are ['10', 'K'] giving a total of 23. The threshold is 24, meaning you have only 1 point left before you exceed N. If you choose to hit, you risk drawing any card worth more than 1. Since the Ace is the only card worth 1 point (with probability 1\/13), there is a 12\/13 chance you will bust immediately by exceeding the threshold. Meanwhile, your opponent’s two cards (one visible 6 and one unknown from an infinite deck) will almost certainly give a sum well below 23, as his previous behavior has been to stand immediately.\n\nGiven these factors, the optimal move is to Stand. Standing with 23 puts you extremely close to the threshold while avoiding the nearly certain bust risk associated with hitting.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given that your current total is 16 and you can hit without any risk of “busting” (because even if you draw a King or Q or any 13‐value card, 16+13=29 still stays under the threshold 44), you have a wide safety margin. In every round so far your opponent has simply stood with their initial two cards (with the one face‐up card being 8 this round), and based on the infinite deck the opponent’s hidden card is effectively an independent random draw (with an average value of 7). This means the opponent’s total is expected to be roughly 15 (8+7) – well behind even a modest improvement on your score.\n\nFurthermore, because the settlement is decided by who is closer to 44 (if both remain under), it is best for you to build your total as high as possible to beat the opponent’s usually modest sum. Notice that until you reach 32 (i.e. total ≤31), there is zero risk of busting since even the highest card (13) would keep you at 44 or less. Thus, from your current position (16), you are in a “risk‐free” zone to continue drawing – in order to increase your final total (and advantage) considerably over the opponent’s fixed sum.\n\nTherefore, the optimal decision is to request another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation:\n• Your current total is 23, which is well below the threshold (44). However, note that your opponent’s face‐up card is 8 and the hidden card can be any value from the infinite deck. This means that your opponent’s total will be 8 + X where X is between 1 and 13 (giving totals from 9 to 21).\n• Since if you Stand, your total of 23 is always closer to 44 than any possible opponent total (the opponent’s best would be 21, which is a worse distance: 44 – 21 = 23 compared to 44 – 23 = 21), you’re guaranteed a win.\n• While hitting might give you a higher total closer to 44, it also carries the risk of busting (exceeding 44). Given that standing with 23 beats every opponent outcome here, the optimal move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given that your current total is only 10 with a threshold of 29, you have plenty of room to improve. Your opponent’s two-card total will be between 14 (if the hidden card is an Ace) and 26 (if it is a King), with an expected value around 20. Meanwhile, your own total is far below the threshold. Since the opponent always stands with two cards, you can safely hit multiple times to approach 29 without busting. Therefore, the optimal decision on the first turn is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Our situation in Round 8 is as follows:\n • Threshold N = 29.\n • Your cards: [5, 5, J] for a total of 21.\n • The opponent’s face‐up card is a K (worth 13); his second card is unknown.\n • In Turn 1 you already hit and now you are to decide on Turn 2.\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n\n1. When you stand at 21 you “lock in” a total of 21. To decide the outcome, the opponent’s final total will be 13 plus his hidden card (which is equally likely to be any of the 13 cards from the infinite deck). That gives his total a range from 14 (if his card is an Ace, worth 1) up to 26 (if it is a K, worth 13). In settlement the side whose total is closest to 29 wins (if both sides are under 29). In our case, your margin is 29 – 21 = 8. By comparing with the opponent’s possible margins (for an unknown card r, his total is 13 + r with margin 29 – (13 + r) = 16 – r), you win if 8 > 16 – r (i.e. if r < 8), tie if r = 8, and lose otherwise. A simple calculation shows that if you stand your chance of winning averages to about 7.5\/13 ≈ 57.7%.\n\n2. If you choose to hit (i.e. request one more card from the deck) your current total of 21 will increase by the value of the drawn card. However, with the threshold of 29 you can only “safely” add a card of value 8 or less (Ace = 1, 2, …, 8) because a card with value 9 or more would make your total exceed 29 (busting) and you would automatically lose. In an infinite deck model each card type is equally likely (1 in 13 chance) so the chance of drawing a “safe” card is 8\/13 ≈ 61.5%. Moreover, even if you do draw one of the safe cards, your new total might still be lower than what you’d get by standing at 21. (For example, if you draw a 1 you’d have 22—a better number, but if you draw an 8 your total would be the “perfect” 29. Yet the average outcome over the safe draws turns out lower than the win probability obtained by standing.) A careful look using dynamic programming (by considering the value of hitting versus standing for totals from 21 up to 29) shows that at 21 the “stand” option gives an expected winning score of roughly 57.7%, while hitting would yield an expected outcome of around 54.1% due to the risk of busting.\n\n3. Therefore, the optimal strategy given your current 21 versus the opponent’s known K is to stand.\n\nSo based on the rules and our analysis, you should choose to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the rules and current situation, here’s the reasoning:\n\n• Your current total is 14 (with a 2 and a Q, where Q = 12).\n• The threshold (N) is 38, meaning you have plenty of room (38 – 14 = 24) to add cards without the risk of busting immediately.\n• The opponent’s total is based on a 5 plus an unknown card. Even if the unknown card is high, the opponent’s final total will likely be well below 38.\n• Since the win is determined by being closer to 38 without busting, standing with 14 would give you a much larger gap to cover than the opponent’s likely low total.\n• With such a low current total and ample headroom, taking another card (Hit) is the optimal move to improve your total closer to 38.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Looking at the current round, the threshold is 38. Your cards are ['2', 'Q', '8'] which add to 22, giving you a shortfall of 16 from 38. Your opponent’s known card is a 5 and their unknown card is drawn uniformly from 13 possible cards (A=1, 2, 3, …, 10, J=11, Q=12, K=13). This means the opponent’s total will be 5 plus a number between 1 and 13, ranging from 6 to 18. Even in the best case for the opponent (if the unknown card is 13), their total is 18, which is still 20 points below the threshold (difference of 38–18=20).\n\nSince our settlement rule awards the win to the side with the smaller shortfall from N, if you stand at 22 your difference is 38–22 = 16, which is lower than any possible opponent difference (ranging from 38–6 = 32 to 38–18 = 20). Additionally, hitting now is risk-free in terms of busting (since adding any card value between 1 and 13 to 22 gives a maximum of 35) but it isn’t necessary: you are already guaranteed to be closer to 38 than the opponent, regardless of the unknown card.\n\nTherefore, the optimal decision is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given that your current total is 15 and the threshold is extremely high (48), the risk of busting on your first hit is zero – no matter what card you draw, your total will remain well below 48. In previous rounds the opponent has always stood immediately. Their total is fixed at 8 plus a randomly drawn card (with values from 1 to 13), meaning their final total will be between 9 and 21. Standing now with only 15 would nearly guarantee that you’ll be beaten by a higher opponent total most of the time. \n\nSince drawing any card from an infinite deck will keep your total safe and increase your chance of eventually getting much closer to 48 (and therefore beating the opponent’s total), the optimal decision here is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the current situation:\n• Your cards: ['8', '7', 'J'] with total = 8 + 7 + 11 = 26.\n• The threshold (N) is 48.\n• The opponent’s face-up card is '8' and the second card is unknown. Since the deck is infinite and all card values are equally likely (values 1, 2, …, 13), the opponent’s unknown card is uniformly distributed over these values. This means the opponent’s final total is 8 + X, where X ranges from 1 to 13, giving a final total between 9 and 21.\n• The settlement rules dictate that if neither side exceeds the threshold, the side whose total is closest to N wins.\n\nBy standing with a total of 26:\n– Your distance from the threshold is 48 − 26 = 22.\n– The opponent’s best-case total is 21 (if X = 13), for which the distance would be 48 − 21 = 27.\nEven in the best (or worst) outcome from the opponent’s perspective, your total of 26 is closer to 48.\n\nAlso, hitting further would only add risk of eventually overshooting the threshold (although with a maximum card of 13 you’re safe in the next hit, further hits might be riskier), without any need for improvement since your current total already beats all of the opponent’s possible totals.\n\nThus, your best move in Turn 2 is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Because the opponent’s visible card (a J worth 11) and their hidden card are unknown, the opponent likely has a sum that could end up quite higher (though still under 42 if they play conservatively) if they hit. With a current low total (20) and plenty of “room” before reaching the bust limit (42), it makes sense to take additional cards in order to get closer to 42 and beat the opponent’s final value. In other words, standing on 20 is very conservative given that both sides want to be as close to 42 as possible. Therefore, the optimal move in this round is to ask for another card – that is, Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the game rules and the current situation, you currently have a total of 24, which is quite a bit lower than the threshold of 42. Since your opponent has already chosen to stand with one known card (J = 11) and one unknown, their total will most likely be considerably lower than 42. By hitting now, you risk no immediate bust because even drawing the highest value (K, which is 13) would bring your total to only 37 (24 + 13), which is still safely under 42. Therefore, getting closer to 42 by taking another card increases your chance of beating your opponent, who stands with a relatively low total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the current state, your total is 29. Your opponent clearly showed a strategy of standing on their turn (as noted in both the Move History turns). With the opponent already standing, his final score consists of his one visible card (J, value 11) plus his unknown card (which, even if it were the highest possible value, K, 13, sums to only 24). That means if you stand with 29, you already have a score closer to the threshold (42) than any outcome your opponent can have without drawing further cards.\n\nSince 29 is well above any possible total your opponent can have (since 11 + 1 = 12 is the minimum and 11 + 13 = 24 is the maximum), you are guaranteed the win if you stand. Although you have an option to hit, any additional card is unnecessary because—even if safe at this moment—a hit could only risk complicating the situation without offering any extra advantage.\n\nThus, the optimal strategy is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current round:\n• Your total is 24 with a J (11) and a K (13).\n• The threshold is 38 and even the highest possible card (value 13) would only bring you to 37 (24 + 13), which is still safe.\n• Since you cannot bust from one hit and you want to be as close as possible to 38 to beat an opponent who tends to stand early, it makes sense to request an additional card.\nTherefore, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given your current cards (['J', 'K', '2'] for a total of 26) and a threshold of 38, you have plenty of room between 26 and 38. However, your opponent already chose to stand on Turn 1. Their only two cards are a '7' and an unknown card. Since every card’s value is at least 1 and at most 13, the opponent’s total will be between 8 and 20 (7 + 1 = 8 minimum, 7 + 13 = 20 maximum). If you stand with 26, you are guaranteed to be closer to 38 than your opponent regardless of what the unknown card is. Although hitting carries a low risk of busting (if you draw a 13, you’d exceed 38), even a safe hit would only improve your total without changing the fact that 26 already beats any possible total the opponent can have.\n\nThus, the best decision is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","We want to maximize our chance of ending up with a total that is as close to 35 as possible while staying below or equal to 35. In round 3 the threshold is 35 and your cards add up to 12. Even if you get the highest‐value card (a “K” worth 13) your sum would be 25, which is still safely below 35. Meanwhile your opponent’s only revealed card is a 9 and—based on previous rounds—they have been standing immediately. (In rounds 1–2 the opponent never hit.) That tells you the opponent will finish with just 9 plus one unknown card (which by the distribution is most likely around 7 on average – giving them roughly 16 in total). \n\nBecause a higher final total (without busting) wins by being “closer” to 35 versus your opponent’s total, your goal is to “push” your total as high as you can without “busting” (i.e. exceeding 35). With a total of 12 you have a large “safety margin” (35 – 12 = 23); no card can overrun the limit because even a King (13) would bring you to 25. \n\nThus, the smart move now is to request an additional card (Hit) and then continue evaluating as your total increases. In short, the answer is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","We can work through the situation. In Round 3 the threshold is 35. Your current cards are “5”, “7”, “7”, totaling 19. The opponent shows a 9 and one unknown card; in previous rounds the opponent always “stood” immediately (so his hand remains at two cards). Since his total is 9 plus an unknown drawn from an infinite deck (where “A” is 1, numbers as given, and face cards are 11, 12, or 13), his final total will be 10 (if the unknown is an Ace) up to 22 maximum (if the unknown is a King, 9+13). In fact, his totals are 10, 11, 12, …, 18, 19, 20, 21, or 22 with equal probability (each outcome 1\/13 probability).\n\nIf you stand now at 19 then:\n• If the opponent’s unseen card is 1–9 (making his total 10–18), you win.\n• If it is 10 (making 19), it’s a draw.\n• If it’s J, Q, or K (values 11, 12, 13 added to 9 yield totals 20, 21, or 22), you lose.\nThat gives you about a 9\/13 win chance, 1\/13 draw, and 3\/13 loss, an expected score around 0.73.\n\nSince you’re well under the threshold of 35 and given that a win is assured if you reach any total of 23 or more (opponent’s maximum is 22), it is optimal to take another card. Moreover the remaining “room” before busting (you’d only bust if you exceed 35) means that hitting won’t risk busting immediately. An optimal strategy is to \"hit\" until you’re at or above 23 to secure a win most of the time. With your current total of 19, you need to hit.\n\nThus, the best move on Turn 2 is to ask for an additional card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation:\n• Your current total is 31 and the threshold is 35.\n• If you stand, your total remains 31. The opponent’s known card is 9 and since his fixed strategy is to stand immediately, his final total will be 9 plus his unknown card (which will be at most 13, i.e. 22 at most). This means his total will always be well below yours, making you closer to the threshold.\n• If you hit, adding any card 5 or more will bust you (since 31 + 5 = 36 > 35), and only cards valued 1–4 keep you safe. With a uniform probability from an infinite deck, that safe chance is 4⁄13 while the risk of busting is 9⁄13.\nThus, standing guarantees a win while hitting has a risk of busting and losing the round.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the history, we can deduce that your opponent’s fixed strategy is to always stand with only the two starting cards. In every previous round the opponent never hit.\n\nIn the current round the threshold is 28. Your two cards, Jack (worth 11) and 7, sum to 18. Meanwhile, the opponent shows an Ace (worth 1) with an unknown second card; if the opponent’s fixed playing style is to stand immediately, his final total will be 1 plus whatever card he holds (ranging from 1 to 13, i.e. a total between 2 and 14). In any such case the opponent’s distance from 28 will be considerably larger than your current 28 – 18 = 10 (for example, even if his hidden card is a King, 13, his total would be 1+13 = 14, leaving a difference of 28 – 14 = 14).\n\nIf you choose to hit, although there is a chance to improve your hand (for example, drawing a 10 would give you 28 exactly), you also risk busting (if you draw an 11, 12, or 13, your total would exceed 28). Given that standing now guarantees a win against any total the opponent can have, the optimal move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current state, you have a total of 10 points (from Ace = 1 and 9) with a threshold of 26; you’re far from the limit. Your opponent’s face‐up card is a \"10\" and they already show a pattern of always standing on their two initial cards. In this round the dealer’s total will simply be 10 plus the value of the unknown card (ranging between 1 and 13), meaning the dealer’s total will be between 11 and 23—always below 26. With your total so low, there is no risk of busting on your next hit, and you have a significant opportunity to get much closer to 26 while still being safe. Therefore, to maximize your chance of winning, the optimal move is to request another card, i.e. “Hit.”\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our analysis, here’s what we did:\n\n1. Our current round has a threshold (N) of 26. We hold three cards: A, 9, and 7. With Ace counted as 1, our total is 1 + 9 + 7 = 17.\n2. The opponent shows a 10, and their unknown card is drawn from an “infinite deck” of 13 types (Ace = 1, numbers 2–10 as their value, and face cards J = 11, Q = 12, K = 13). Thus if we were to stand immediately with a total of 17 the expected outcome (comparing our distance to 26 versus the opponent’s) would be: we win if the opponent’s unknown card is 1–6, tie if it is 7, and lose otherwise. That gives an expected score of 0.5.\n3. Instead, we analyzed what happens if we hit. With 17, a drawn card must be ≤9 to keep our total ≤26 (since 17 + 9 = 26). An infinite deck means that 9 of the 13 possible card types are “safe” and 4 lead to bust (if we get a 10, J, Q, or K, we exceed 26).\n4. We then set up a dynamic programming analysis. Calling V(s) the eventual expected score with the best strategy when holding a total s, we computed (backwards from s = 26, which is “ideal” because standing gives a 100% win against any opponent total) the “stand” payoff f(s) at each sum and compared it to the “hit” option (which mixes the possibility of obtaining a safe card and continuing versus busting and getting 0).\n5. For s = 17 we obtained:\n  – The stand option gives an expected score of about 0.5.\n  – The hit option (averaging over all safe draws and factoring in bust probability) yields an expected score of roughly 0.585.\n6. Since 0.585 > 0.5, the optimal move is to take another card.\n\nThus, for Round 5 on Turn 2, the best recommended action is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","We analyze the current round. Your cards are [Q, 10] which add up to 22. The opponent’s face‐up card is a 2 and their hidden card is unknown; however, from previous rounds the opponent always stands no matter what. This implies that the opponent’s final total will be 2 plus a random card draw. Since the card values are from an infinite deck (each card type equally likely among 13 types), the opponent’s total will be between 3 (if the hidden card is an Ace worth 1) and 15 (if the hidden card is a K worth 13)—all comfortably below the threshold N = 32.\n\nIf you choose to stand with 22, your distance from the threshold is 32 – 22 = 10. For the opponent, even if they get the highest card (K, 13), their total becomes 15 with a distance of 32 – 15 = 17. No matter what hidden card the opponent holds, their distance to 32 will always exceed your 10. This guarantees that if you stand now, you win the round.\n\nOn the other hand, if you decide to hit, you add an extra card to your total. Since you’re at 22, hitting is safe only if the new card is 10 or less (a 1 through 10), which happens with probability 10\/13. However, if you draw a face card (J, Q, or K – each worth 11, 12, or 13), you would bust and lose the round. Even though a successful hit would bring you closer to 32 and still secure a win, the risk of drawing a card that causes you to exceed 32 (with a probability of 3\/13) makes hitting inferior to the sure win available by standing.\n\nTherefore, the best strategy in this situation is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation we have, our current total is only 9 when the threshold is 40. In every previous round the opponent has always stood, meaning that his final value is simply the sum of his two dealt cards. Given that two random cards average about 7 each (making roughly 14 on average) and his past totals have been rather low, we have a lot of room to safely draw cards to get closer to 40. With a current total of 9, even the highest possible card (worth 13 points) will keep us safely below the threshold. Therefore, it is best to “Hit” to improve our chance of coming closer to 40 without busting, and to leave the opponent behind with his low fixed total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is 18 while the threshold is 40. The opponent’s fixed strategy is to stand immediately on the first turn (their cards are ‘3’ and an unknown card, giving a total in the range 4–16). With a very low risk of busting (since any card drawn when your total is 18 will add at most 13, leading to 31, which is still well below 40), you can safely hit. The goal is to move as close to 40 as possible to beat the opponent’s likely low total while remaining safely under 40. Therefore, the optimal decision at Turn 2 is to ask for another card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Let’s analyze the situation:\n\n• Your current total is 30 (cards: 4, 5, 9, Q).  \n• The threshold is 40.  \n• The opponent’s face‐up card is a 3, and his face‐down card is unknown. However, based on the past rounds the opponent always stands immediately on his turn.\n\nIf you choose to stand now with 30, the opponent’s total will be 3 plus the unknown card. Even in the best case for the opponent (drawing the highest card, a K worth 13), his total would be 3 + 13 = 16. This total is much further from the threshold of 40 than your 30 is; the “distance” for you is 40 – 30 = 10, while for him it is at minimum 40 – 16 = 24 (and could be even larger for lower cards).\n\nIf you decide to hit, you risk busting:\n – Any drawn card with value 11, 12, or 13 would push your total above 40 (e.g., 30 + 11 = 41), causing you to exceed the threshold and lose immediately.\n – Although drawing 10 would give you a perfect 40, and drawing 1–9 would yield totals from 31 to 39 (still safe), you’re already in a winning position if you stand because the opponent’s maximum possible total is far below yours.\n\nTherefore, the risk introduced by hitting does not improve your already winning position. Playing safe by standing guarantees a win, given that the opponent has no chance of getting near 40.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on analyzing the past rounds and observing that your opponent always stands (regardless of their total), you are aiming to get as close as possible to the threshold of 36 without exceeding it. With your current two cards (6 and 5, totaling 11), you are far below the threshold and have plenty of room to improve your hand. Given that the opponent’s strategy appears fixed (standing on their available hand), you want to build a stronger total than what the opponent is likely to have. Thus, it makes sense for you to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation and the opponent’s fixed strategy, the opponent always stands with the two initial cards. In this round the opponent’s face‐up card is “2” and the face‑down card, drawn from an infinite deck of 13 card types, will add between 1 and 13 points to give a total between 3 and 15. With a threshold of 36, any total in that range is far from 36. You currently have 18, yielding a difference of 36 – 18 = 18, while the opponent’s best (closest) result is 36 – (2 + 13) = 21. This means that if you stand now, the difference between 36 and your total (18) is less than that for the opponent in every case, guaranteeing a win without any additional risk. Although hitting might allow you to get even closer to 36, you already have a winning position and any additional hit risks the possibility of busting on subsequent draws. Therefore, the optimal move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Our goal is to end up as close as possible to the threshold (35) without going over, while winning against an opponent who always stands with their initial two cards. Right now, your total is 13 (from an Ace [worth 1] and a Q [worth 12]), which is very far from 35. Meanwhile, your opponent only shows a 7, and since they never hit, their total will be 7 plus whatever their hidden card is. Given the card values and the fact that the deck is infinite (meaning card draws have an average value of 7), the opponent’s average total would be around 14. Therefore, if you stand now at 13, you are in a strong disadvantage.\n\nSince the maximum card value available is 13 and your current total is 13, even the highest card drawn on your first hit would bring you to 26 (well below the threshold of 35), so there is no immediate bust risk on hitting even once. Taking into account your need to approach 35 to beat the opponent’s likely total, the optimal move is to request an additional card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is 19. If you stand, your winning chances depend on the opponent’s unknown card; specifically, against a dealer holding 7 plus one additional card (whose value is uniformly one of the 13 possibilities), your EV when standing with 19 works out to about 0.8846. However, if you choose to hit, you are guaranteed not to bust (since 19 plus the maximum of 13 equals 32, which is below the threshold of 35). Drawing a new card gives you a total between 20 and 32. In almost every case the new total will be at least 21—which, given that the opponent’s total can only go as high as 20 (7 plus at most 13), wins automatically. (The only exception is getting a 1 from the hit, which brings you to 20; however, even with 20 it is safe to hit again because 20+any card will still be 33 or less.) \n\nThus, it is clearly better to hit in order to improve your total and guarantee a win. Therefore, the optimal move in this round is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analyzing the situation:\n• Your current total is 22. The threshold is 35, so you’re 13 points away.\n• Your opponent shows a 7. Their hidden card (drawn uniformly from the 13 values: 1 through 13) means their total will be 7 plus that card. Therefore, their total can only be between 8 and 20. Their “gap” from 35 will always be between 15 (if 7+13) and 27 (if 7+1).\n• If you Stand, your gap is 35–22 = 13, which is strictly lower than any possible gap your opponent has (their best is 15). In every case, you’re closer to 35 and win the round.\n• Although hitting would increase your total (and reduce your gap further), even the worst new total (22+1 = 23, gap = 12) still beats any outcome your opponent can have. However, by standing you already guarantee victory without any risk—you’re already assured a win if you stand.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the game board and rules, you’re starting round 10 with a total of 22 points and a threshold of 36. Since any additional card will give you a value between 1 and 13, one more hit cannot make you bust (even with a 13 your total would be 35, still below 36). Moreover, because settlement rewards the side with the sum closest to N (36), you benefit from trying to get higher than 22. Observing that your opponent’s visible card is 8 (and his stuck “stand” strategy means his total will be in the range 9–21), you are highly unlikely to beat him unless you increase your own total. Therefore, the best choice is to hit now.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given your current total is 23 and the threshold is 36, note that any card drawn now will add between 1 and 13. Since 23 + 13 = 36, you’re guaranteed not to bust on this hit. Moreover, your current gap from 36 is 13, while the opponent’s total (with an up card of 8 and a hidden card between 1 and 13) will at best get to 21 (gap of at least 15). By hitting now you can only improve your closeness to 36 without risk. Therefore, the optimal move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round details, you're at 24 points while the opponent has a card showing '8' and one unknown card. Given that the opponent’s strategy is always to stand after receiving two cards, his final total will be 8 plus the unknown card value. Since all cards are drawn from an infinite deck, the maximum score the opponent can get is 8 + 13 = 21. With a threshold of 36, there is no risk of busting for the opponent. Consequently, if you choose to stand at 24, your total is greater than any possible total the opponent can have (since 24 > 21), meaning you are already closer to 36.\n\nIf you choose to hit in hopes of approaching 36 even more closely, you run the risk of busting (for example, drawing a 13 would result in 24 + 13 = 37, which exceeds the threshold). Since standing at 24 guarantees a win against any two‐card hand the opponent could have given his fixed strategy, the best decision is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Even if you draw the highest value card (K worth 13), your total would become 26, which is still under the threshold. Playing conservatively (i.e., standing at 13) is not optimal when you can safely get closer to 27, especially since the opponent’s strategy is fixed and their visible card is a low 3. Therefore, the best strategic move at this stage is to request an additional card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the opponent’s situation and the cards in play, the opponent’s total is 3 plus a card that can only add between 1 and 13 points, making the maximum possible total 16. With your total at 19, even though you are below the threshold of 27, your hand is already guaranteed to beat any possible opponent total. Hitting only risks busting (if you draw a 9 or any card of value 10, J, Q, or K) since adding anything other than Ace through 8 would exceed 27. Therefore, the best decision is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation:\n• Your current total is 14, which is very far below the threshold of 37.\n• Since you've only seen one of the opponent’s cards (5) and the unknown card could be moderate to high, it’s unlikely that the opponent already has a high total.\n• Given the significant gap between 14 and 37, you have plenty of room to safely draw additional cards.\nThus, the risk of going over 37 is minimal at this stage, and increasing your total is key to having a competitive hand.\n\nSo, you should choose to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, here’s the analysis:\n\n• Your current total is 23.  \n• The opponent already stood after the first turn. His visible card is 5 and his hidden card is unknown. Given the card values, his total will be 5 plus a value in [1,13] (even if we assume all card values are equally likely, his maximum sum is 18).  \n• Since the settlement rules compare how close each side’s total is to the threshold (N = 37), a total of 23 is much closer than any total your opponent can possibly have.  \n• Although you could safely “hit” (since even drawing the highest card, 13, would bring you to 36, still below 37) you already have a guaranteed win if you stand now. Taking another card would only risk eventually “busting” (if you try to hit again when your total is high).  \n• Therefore, to ensure a win with no unnecessary risk, the optimal decision is to “Stand” at 23.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current game situation, our total is only 20 while the threshold is 44. The opponent’s face‐up card is an Ace (worth 1) and his unknown card will add between 1 and 13 points, so his two‐card total can be at most 14. In the previous rounds the opponent has chosen to stand immediately with totals (16 and 13), which strongly suggests his fixed strategy is to not hit at all during his turn.\n\nSince we are far from busting (20 + any card between 1 and 13 will still be well under 44) and because our goal is to get as close to 44 as possible (to beat the opponent’s low two‐card total reliably), the optimal move is to request another card (Hit). Further hitting is likely to be safe until our total approaches the risky zone (over 31, for example).\n\nTherefore, on Turn 1 of Round 3, you should choose to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current records, your hand sums to 21 (8 + Q (12) + A (1)). The opponent’s only known card is an Ace (1), and their second card (drawn uniformly from the infinite deck) will add between 1 and 13 points, so their total will be between 2 and 14. The rule for settlement is that, when neither side exceeds threshold 44, the total closest to 44 wins. Standing with 21 gives a difference of 23 (44–21). Even if your opponent's total is at its highest possible (14), the difference for them is 30 (44–14). Since 23 is less than 30 (and in fact less than any difference the opponent can muster from totals between 2 and 14), standing guarantees that your total is closer to 44 and thus secures a win. Although you have room to hit safely (since even the largest card drawn would keep your sum under 44), there is no need to risk drawing another card when the win is essentially assured by standing.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the board and rules analysis:\n\n• Your hand is currently K (13) and 4, totaling 17.\n• The opponent shows an A (value 1) and one unknown card. In the past, the opponent always stood on the deal. This means their final total will be 1 plus the unknown card’s value. Since all cards come from the same infinite deck, the unknown card is equally likely to be any card from A (1) to K (13), giving the opponent a total between 2 and 14.\n• The settlement rule is that if neither side exceeds the threshold (N = 26), the side closest to 26 wins. With you holding 17, your “distance” to 26 is 9.\n• For the opponent, even in the best-case scenario (drawing a K, so total = 13 + 1 = 14), their distance is 26 – 14 = 12. In every possible case, your distance (9) is less than the opponent’s distance. This means if you stand with 17, you are guaranteed to win—the opponent’s score will always be further away from 26.\n• Hitting would introduce an unnecessary risk because you’d be adding a new card to your total. To avoid busting (exceeding 26), you can only draw a card of value 9 or less (9 out of 13 possible cards). Even if you draw safely, your total would be between 18 and 26. While a total closer to 26 improves your “distance margin,” a hit carries the risk of busting (if you draw a 10, 11, 12, or 13, you exceed 26) and losing immediately.\n• Since standing at 17 already guarantees that your distance (26 – 17 = 9) is less than any possible opponent’s distance (lowest being 26 – 14 = 12), the safest and optimal move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation, you currently have 21 (8 + K, where K is 13) on a threshold of 27. The opponent’s visible card is a 2 and their second card is unknown—but looking at previous rounds the opponent has always chosen to stand with the initial two cards. This means their total will be 2 plus whatever the second card is. Even if that card turns out to be the highest value (K = 13), the total would be 15 (2 + 13), which is far from the threshold 27.\n\nIf you decide to hit, you risk busting. With 21 you can safely draw only when the card value is 6 or less (adding up to a total between 22 and 27). There are 6 safe card values (Ace=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) out of 13 possible cards, giving you a safe chance of 6\/13 and a bust chance of 7\/13. Considering that the opponent is very likely to remain with a lower total (since they have stood from the start in previous rounds), taking the risk of a hit is not favorable.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move is to Stand. This guarantees that you maintain your 21, which is much closer to the threshold of 27 than the likely total of the opponent.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the analysis, with a threshold of 26 and starting at 12 points, your current total is very low relative to the target. In all previous rounds your opponent has followed a fixed “stand‐at–first–turn” policy. This means that in this round the opponent will very likely not take any extra cards, and their total (with a visible “4” and a hidden card) is likely to be much lower than what can be achieved safely.\n\nBecause your total is only 12, and because any single card (from 1 up to King = 13) added to 12 stays under 26 (the maximum allowed) – and since you can then continue to improve your score without immediate bust risk – the optimal strategy is to “Hit” now so as to work toward a total that is close to 26. A strategy that reaches totals around 18 or more gives you an advantage (as standing with 18 or more guarantees a winning outcome in comparison with the opponent’s limited range).\n\nThus, for Round 6, with your current cards totaling 12 against a dealer showing “4”, the best move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round situation, your total is 20 and the threshold is 26. Your opponent’s visible card is 4 and since their unknown card can only add a value between 1 and 13, their total will range from 5 (4+1) to 17 (4+13). Given that the opponent’s maximum possible total is 17, your 20 already beats them. Hitting would risk drawing a card that could push your total over 26, whereas standing secures a win. Therefore, the best move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Your current total is 23, and the threshold is 26. If you choose to hit, you can only safely draw a card that is 3 or lower (since 23 + 4 = 27 would bust), and only Ace (1), 2, or 3 would be safe. In an infinite deck where every rank is equally likely, that’s 3 out of 13 chances (about 23%) to not bust. Meanwhile, the opponent’s known card is “2” and their second card is unknown. Based on previous rounds the opponent always stands with their initial 2 cards, meaning their total will be 2 plus the unknown card’s value—at most 15. Even with your current total of 23 (which is just 3 points away from the threshold of 26), you are already much closer to 26 than any possible opponent total.\n\nThus, risking a hit (with roughly a 77% chance to bust) is unnecessary—the optimal move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the rules and looking at the situation, note the following:\n\n• Your current total is 10, and the dealer (opponent) shows a J (worth 11) plus an unknown card. In every previous round the dealer’s fixed strategy was to stand immediately. That means the dealer’s total stays as J plus the unknown card. Since the unknown card is equally likely to be any of the 13 types (values 1, 2, …, 10, 11, 12, 13), the dealer’s total will range between 12 (if the unknown card is an Ace) and 24 (if it is a K).\n\n• When neither side busts (exceed N, which is 48 in this round), the winner is simply the one whose total is closer to 48. In our case, notice that if you can get a sum of 25 or more without busting, you will automatically have a total greater than the dealer’s maximum (24) and win outright. (If you stand with 25 or any number up to 48, the dealer’s possible totals are all lower.) \n\n• With your current sum of 10, there is absolutely no risk of busting on a hit because even the highest card (a K for 13) would put you at 23. Therefore, it is best to hit. In fact, until your sum reaches at least 25 you are at a disadvantage when standing. \n\nThus, the optimal strategy for this round is to “Hit” at the first opportunity. After each hit, you should continue to hit as long as your total is below 25 (because standing with less than 25 risks losing or drawing, since the dealer’s total is always at most 24). Once you reach 25 or above, you should “Stand” to lock in a win.\n\nFor the current turn, with your sum at 10, the best move is:\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round:\n• The threshold is 48, and you currently only have 12 points.\n• Even if you add up to the maximum single card (13) on a hit, you’d only reach 25, which is well below the threshold.\n• Your opponent already stood after getting a face‐up card of J (11) along with a hidden card (which on average would add about 7 points to give roughly 18); even if the opponent’s hidden card turns out high, they will not risk additional hits.\n• With such a high threshold relative to your current low total, there is no risk of immediately busting. As you have a safe margin, your best move is to ask for an additional card in order to improve your total and have a greater chance of beating the opponent’s final score.\n\nTherefore, the recommended decision is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, your current total is 13 while the opponent shows an 11 and holds one unknown card. Since the opponent’s unknown card plus 11 can only total between 12 and 24, your winning condition is to end with a total above 24 (so that you beat any possible opponent total). With a threshold of 48 you have plenty of room to draw additional cards safely. Staying at 13 would almost certainly result in a loss (or at best a draw in very limited cases). Therefore, advancing your total by taking another card (Hit) is the best option because you want to reach at least 25 without busting. Considering the risk and the safe margin left, the most advantageous move now is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the rules and our current situation, our total is 16 and the threshold is as high as 48. Since there’s no risk of busting even if we take a card with the maximum value (16 + 13 = 29, still well below 48), improving our total is a safe and necessary move. Meanwhile, our opponent has a visible card J (11) and an unknown card that on average would bring his total to about 18. If we were to stand now with 16, we’re likely beaten by his total. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to take another card (“Hit”) in order to get closer to the threshold and improve our odds of winning.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the analysis:\n\n• The opponent’s behavior is fixed—they always “stand” after receiving their two cards. Their face‐up card is J (11) so their final total is 11 plus an unknown card value. With equal probability over Ace (1), 2–10, J (11), Q (12), or K (13), the opponent’s total will lie between 12 and 24. In previous rounds their totals were in the lower teens so your card value of 17 would win only when the opponent’s unknown card is very low. In fact, if you were to “stand” with 17, you’d only win if the opponent’s total is less than 17 (a probability of only 5 out of 13 chances) with a draw in 1 out of 13 and losing in 7 out of 13 cases.\n\n• With the threshold (N = 48) being very high, you have a lot of room to safely add cards. Even if you hit and get a high card, your total will still be far from 48 for a while. In fact, you can use the “hit” option to move toward a “safe zone” where your score beats any total the opponent might have (since the opponent’s maximum will be 24). For example, once you reach a total of 25 or above you are guaranteed to beat the opponent’s two‐card hand.\n\nSince your current total is only 17 (well below the safe zone) and there’s no immediate risk of busting by adding a card (even a 13 only brings you to 30), the optimal strategy is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on analysis, your current total is 25, while the opponent’s two‐card total (with a face‐up “J” [11] and an unknown second card) will be somewhere between 12 and 24. Since neither side is drawing additional cards and the win is determined by who is closer to the threshold (48) without exceeding it, your distance to 48 is 23 points. The opponent’s distance will always be larger (at worst, 24 if they have 11+13) which guarantees that if you stand at 25, you win.\n\nThere’s no benefit in taking an additional card (Hit) because you already have a guaranteed win; hitting only introduces unnecessary risk (even though with the high threshold you’d be unlikely to bust, you could inadvertently overshoot your ideal safety margin on subsequent turns). Therefore, the optimal move in this situation is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the rules and the situation, here is the reasoning:\n\n• You win whenever you finish with a total that is closer to the threshold (N = 44) than the opponent’s total. In this game the opponent always stands with just two cards. With a face‐up card of K (value 13), his total is 13 plus the unknown card (which will be between 1 and 13, so his total will be between 14 and 26).\n\n• Because the win is determined by who is closer to 44 (as long as neither goes over), any total greater than 26 guarantees that you are closer than the opponent. In other words, if you can secure a total of 27 or more (without exceeding 44), you will win regardless of the opponent’s secret card.\n\n• Your current total is 6 from the cards ['A', '5'] (remember, Ace = 1). You need at least 21 more points to reach 27. Since 27 is already safely above every possible dealer total (dealer’s max is 26), your target should be to hit until you reach a total of 27 or more.\n\n• Early in the round (with a total of 6), there is essentially zero risk of busting because the worst card (a 13) only takes you to 19. Therefore, the optimal play in this situation is to Take a Hit.\n\nThus, you should hit on the current turn.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round details, you currently have a very low total (10 points) compared to the threshold of 44. The opponent’s face‐up card is a K (worth 13 points) and since they already stood, their total will be what it is. Meanwhile, you have many “points” available before reaching 44, giving you plenty of room to safely draw additional cards. Considering that the opponent is not taking further cards and that your total is far from 44, hitting gives you a much better chance of approaching 44 while outperforming your opponent. \n\nThus, in the current situation on Turn 2, the optimal move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the analysis of the current state, our total is 21 and the opponent’s known card is a K (worth 13) with the other unknown. In every previous round the opponent never took any extra cards (always standing), so his final total will simply be 13 plus his hidden card. That unknown card is equally likely to be any of 1, 2, …, 13. If we stand with 21 our gap from the threshold 44 is 23. In that case we win only if the opponent’s unknown card is low (so that his total is under 21), draw if it makes 21, and lose if it is high enough (for instance, if his total is 22 or more). In fact, standing with 21 gives us a win only if the unknown is 1–7 (7\/13 chance), a tie if it’s an 8 (1\/13), and a loss if it’s 9–13 (5\/13). \n\nBecause the threshold is 44, we have plenty of “room” for improvement. Even if we draw the largest possible card (a K, worth 13), our new sum becomes 21 + 13 = 34, safely below 44. With such a safe hit, we can work toward a higher total that is closer to 44 than most opponent totals (which are at best 26 if the unknown card is a 13). By hitting now (and then planning subsequent moves based on the new total), we can increase our chance of beating the opponent’s final sum. \n\nThus, the optimal move in Turn 3 is to request another card – that is, choose Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, you have a total of 32 and the threshold is 44. The dealer shows a King (13) and has one unknown card; however, in all previous rounds the opponent has always chosen to stand immediately, which means his final total will be 13 plus the value of the hidden card. Since every card from the deck (A=1, 2–10, J=11, Q=12, K=13) is possible, the dealer’s total will fall somewhere between 14 (if the unknown card is an Ace) and 26 (if it is a King). In every case the dealer’s total will be much lower than 32, making your 32 closer to the threshold (44). \n\nIf you choose to stand, your gap from 44 is 12, while the dealer’s gap will range from 18 to 30. Standing guarantees a win for you in this round.\n\nIf you were to hit, you risk drawing a card that would bring your total closer to 44, but there is also the risk of busting. With 32 already safely under the threshold and guaranteed to beat the dealer’s total, the safe and optimal strategy is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation, you only have 7 points to start with while the threshold is 35. Notice that the opponent’s hand is 7 plus an unknown card. Even if that unknown card is as high as a King (worth 13), their total will be only 20. Since you need to beat (or at least not fall behind) their total and you have plenty of room before reaching 35, you should keep taking cards until you are comfortably above 20 (or even approaching 35 if you’re confident you won’t bust). In this very beginning state, with only 7 points, the risk of busting on the next hit is extremely low. Therefore, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the game situation you provided, your current total is only 14 (with cards ['3','4','7']) and you have a very low risk of overshooting the threshold of 35 if you request another card. Your opponent’s (dealer’s) fixed strategy means they simply stand with their two cards (one visible, one unknown) and their total is 7 plus a random card value (from 1 to 13). In almost every outcome the dealer’s total will be in the range of 8–20, which is far below the threshold. To ensure that you get as close as possible to 35 and beat the dealer’s likely total, you should request another card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round the threshold is 35, your current total is 23 and the opponent’s only visible card is the 7. Since the opponent always stands with his two cards (and his hidden card, even if it’s high, gives him a total at most 20), your 23 already gives you a margin of 12 from 35, which is better than any potential two‐card total the opponent can have. Although drawing a hit would potentially get you closer to 35, it comes with a risk—even though the only bust card is a King (value 13), that’s still a 1\/13 chance to bust—and your current total is already strong enough to secure a win. \n\nThus, the optimal decision here is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The key point to notice is that with 18 you are very safe from busting on your next hit because even if you draw the highest card possible (a King, worth 13 points), your total would become 31, which is still well below 42. Since the goal is to get as close as possible to 42 in order to have a better chance of beating your opponent, hitting here seems to be the optimal play.\n\nTherefore, your move should be to request an additional card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Your current total is 29, and since 42 – 29 = 13 while the maximum card value available is 13, every possible card you can draw will keep you safely below or exactly at the threshold. Meanwhile, the opponent already stands with a visible 3 and one unknown card, meaning their total will be at most 16 (if the hidden card is 13) and as low as 4 (if it’s an Ace). With the settlement rule being that the side closer to 42 wins, your 29 already beats any total the opponent could have (since 42–(3+x) ranges from 26 to 38). \n\nHowever, you have an opportunity to further improve your total without any risk of busting because even the highest card will bring you exactly to 42. This means you can safely hit to get a card that will bring your total closer to 42, further increasing your chance of winning this round.\n\nThus, the best move now is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the rules, you must get as close as possible to 42 without exceeding it. Your current total is 35. If you choose to hit, you risk drawing a card that will exceed the threshold (any card with a value of 8 or higher) because 35 + card > 42 when card > 7. Since card values are uniformly drawn from an infinite set (with values 1,2,…,13), there is a 7\/13 chance of drawing a safe card (an Ace to 7) and a 6\/13 chance of busting immediately. Meanwhile, the opponent’s revealed card is only a 3 and his unknown card (which he already “got” since he stood twice) can only bring his total to between 4 and 16. Standing with 35 already gives you a much closer sum to 42 than any total the opponent can reach under his current situation.\n\nThus, with 35 already outperforming the opponent’s maximum possible total and facing a nearly 46% chance to bust on a hit, the optimal decision is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","We need to compare our options when our total is 22 and the threshold is 32.\n\nRemember that when you hit you risk busting if your new total exceeds 32. Since your total is 22, any card valued 11 or higher (namely J, Q, or K) would bring your total to at least 33 (22+11) and cause a bust. (All cards come from an infinite deck with equal likelihood for the 13 card types.) That means if you hit, there is a 3\/13 chance to bust immediately, and a 10\/13 chance of drawing a “safe” card (an Ace counted as 1 or 2–10) that won’t bust your hand. \n\nIf you stand at 22, your final margin is 32–22 = 10. In the previous round the opponent’s two‐card total (their face-up plus an unknown card) was uniformly one of the possible totals from 13 (if the unknown is Ace =1) up to 25 (if the unknown is K =13). In that case your 22 wins versus any opponent total with a difference larger than 10 (i.e. totals lower than 22), ties if the opponent also totals 22, and loses if the opponent’s total gets closer to 32 (i.e. totals 23 or higher). A quick tally gives approximately a 9\/13 chance to win, 1\/13 chance to draw, and a 3\/13 chance to lose—an expected score around 0.73 (with win =1, draw =0.5, lose =0).\n\nNow, if you hit, you add one card (with equally likely values). To stay safe, the drawn card must be 10 or less (which happens with probability 10\/13). Your new totals would be:\n  • 22+1 = 23 → gap of 9 (winning against many opponent totals, though not as strong as 22 against all lower totals).\n  • 22+2 = 24 → gap of 8,\n  • 22+3 = 25 → gap of 7,\n  • 22+4 = 26 (or higher, if the card is 4 to 10) → gap 6 or less. Notice that once you reach 26 or above, the opponent (whose best total is 25 if they never hit) cannot beat you.\nOn averaging these outcomes (taking into account that if you draw a J, Q, or K you bust and get 0) the expected winning chance becomes marginally higher—about 0.74—making it beneficial to hit.\n\nThus, in this situation the optimal decision is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analyzing the current round: You have cards ['J', 'J', '9'] which total 31 points with a threshold of 32. Hitting now carries a high risk because the only card that wouldn’t make you exceed 32 is an Ace (worth 1 point). In an infinite deck where card values are equally likely, the chance to draw an Ace is very low (roughly 1 in 13). Meanwhile, the opponent’s face‐up card is Q (12), and their unknown card will add only a moderate amount, making it unlikely they will approach 31. Therefore, standing with 31 is the best option because it is almost at the threshold without risking a bust, and your total is higher than any likely total the opponent can achieve with just two cards.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation:\n• Your current total is only 4, which is very far from the threshold 43.\n• The opponent, who always stands immediately with his two cards (a known J worth 11 and an unknown card), is likely to end his turn with a relatively low total.\n• With a huge margin before getting close to 43, you have plenty of room to draw additional cards to improve your total.\nTherefore, the best move is to take another card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your current total is only 10 against a high threshold of 43, there is very little risk of busting, and you need to get closer to 43 to outscore your opponent. Your opponent already chose to stand on the first turn, which suggests they’re likely relying on their current total even though one card is still unknown. Since standing now will almost certainly leave you too far from 43 to win in a showdown if your opponent’s hidden card isn’t too low, the best action is to draw another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the rules and the situation, your current total is 16, and the threshold is 43. Even if you draw the highest card (King or \"K\" worth 13), your total would only become 29, which is still safely under 43. Your opponent, showing a \"J\" (11) on the table and a hidden card, has already reached their decision to stand according to their fixed strategy. Given that you have plenty of room to safely draw additional cards without busting, and since you need to reach as close as possible to 43 to win, it is optimal to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation the optimal move is to ask for another card. With a total of 19 and a threshold of 43 it’s very safe to hit because even the highest‐value card (K=13, yielding a total of 32) won’t cause you to exceed 43. In contrast, your opponent’s strategy is fixed (standing immediately) and so his total will remain based on his two cards – which (with the face-up J being worth 11) will most likely be below yours if you can safely improve your hand. Since you have ample “room” to increase your total with little to no risk of busting on the next hit, the best course of action is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the information, your six cards total 25 points. The opponent’s known card is 'J' (11 points) and his unknown card can add at most 13 points (if it’s a King), which means his total can be between 12 and 24. Since you already have 25, you are guaranteed to beat any possible two‐card total for the opponent when both have stopped. Also, there is no risk of busting if you take a hit now (even a King would bring you to only 38), but while hitting could bring you closer to 43, standing with 25 already wins against any total the opponent can have. Thus, the optimal move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current situation, your total is only 8 (A = 1 and 7 = 7), while the threshold is 40. Your opponent, with a face-up 7 and an unknown card, appears to follow a fixed strategy of standing on their initial hand (as seen in the previous rounds). Standing with only 8 is almost never an option when your opponent is likely holding a higher total.\n\nSince there is a considerable gap between your 8 and the likely value the opponent will hold—even when considering that the deck is infinite and betting against the possibility of busting (given the very high bust limit of 40)—it is clearly beneficial to hit to increase your total toward 40.\n\nThus, the best move in this situation is to take another card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given your current total of 11 in a round where the bust threshold is 40 and the opponent already stood with a card showing 7 (and an unknown card that on average brings his total to around 14), you are far from the threshold. With such a low total, there is essentially no perceptible risk of busting on the next hit (even a King only adds 13, resulting in 24). Since your opponent is likely to remain well below 40, the winning condition depends on who gets closer to 40. Therefore, your best play is to take another card (hit) to improve your position and increase your likelihood of ending up closer to 40 than the opponent. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the records, we see that your opponent always stood and ended with only their two initial cards (in Round 1–3, they never hit), so it appears their fixed strategy is to stand immediately. In the current round the threshold (N) is 40 and your current total is 23, while your opponent shows a 7 and one unknown card. Since the dealer never takes further cards, his final total will be 7 plus that unknown card (which can be anywhere from 1 to 13, i.e. totals between 8 and 20). In all cases your current total of 23 is closer to 40 than the dealer’s possible totals because if you stand now your distance from 40 is 40 – 23 = 17, whereas even with the highest unknown card (a King with value 13) the dealer’s total would be 7 + 13 = 20 and his gap would be 40 – 20 = 20.\n\nMoreover, if you choose to hit, you will add a card between 1 and 13. Even in the worst-case scenario (drawing a 1) your new total becomes 24 giving a gap of 16 from 40. Any higher card improves your margin further, and you are still completely safe from busting (since 23 + 13 = 36 which is still below 40). In every situation, whether you stand or hit, you win because both totals will be under 40 and your gap will be smaller than the opponent’s – but hitting further reduces your gap. \n\nThus, the optimal decision is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the board and rules:\n• Your total is 24 and the threshold is 40.\n• No matter what card you might draw (since cards range from 1 to 13), your new total after one hit (which would be between 25 and 37) will not exceed 40. That means you’re completely safe from busting now.\n• The opponent’s strategy has been to stand right away. With his visible 7 and a hidden card, his total is likely in the range 8–20. In order to win, you want your total to be as high as possible without busting (i.e. as close to 40 as you can).\n• Since your current total (24) is considerably lower than 40, and you have no bust risk on the next card, taking another card (Hit) is the best move to try and get closer to 40.\n\nThus, on Turn 4 your optimal move is to Hit.\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation:\n\n• The threshold is 40.\n• Your current total is 26 (with cards A=1, 7, 3, Q=12, A=1, 2 giving 1+7+3+12+1+2=26).\n• The opponent has a face‐up 7 and a face‐down card. However, reviewing previous rounds shows that the opponent always stands immediately. Thus his final total is 7 plus the unknown card’s value, which, even in the best case (if the unknown card is the highest, 13), would total 20. In all cases his total will remain considerably below 26.\n• Since the win is determined by who is closer to 40 without going over, your current difference is 40–26 = 14 compared to the opponent’s difference of at least 40–20 = 20.\n• Moreover, if you decide to hit, any single card (value 1 to 13) will push you to at most 39 (26+13), so there is no immediate risk of busting on one hit. However, since your goal is to win rather than to get even closer (margin size doesn’t improve your score), and you are already guaranteed to beat an opponent who “stands” with a significantly lower total, taking another card only adds unnecessary risk.\n\nTherefore, the best strategy at Turn 5 is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation, our current total is 16 (King = 13 and 3 = 3) with a threshold of 27. We can safely draw any card with a value up to 11 (since 16 + 11 = 27); drawing a Queen (12) or another King (13) would immediately cause us to bust. In the opponent’s case the visible card is 10 and the hidden card is unknown – in previous rounds the opponent has always “stood” on the initial two cards. So his final total will be 10 plus a card randomly drawn from the infinite deck (with the 13 equally-likely values). This means his finishing value will be 10 + x with x uniformly distributed from 1 to 13, which gives an expected total of 17. (Also, his best chance is when the hidden card is low; if it’s high, he ends up higher; but he never hits according to his fixed strategy.)\n\nIf we stand now with 16, then in nearly 54% of possible cases the opponent (with x ≥ 7, which leads to totals of 17 or more) will beat us. Our computed chance of winning by standing is roughly 38.5% (win if the opponent’s hidden card is 1‑5), with a small chance (about 7.7%) for a draw, resulting in an expected round score of roughly 0.42 points.\n\nAlternatively, by hitting, we have about an 11\/13 chance to draw a “safe” card (value ≤ 11) and improve our hand without busting, while only a 2\/13 chance to bust immediately. For each safe card added (with value d from 1 to 11) our total becomes 16 + d and the “gap” from the threshold shrinks to (27 – 16 – d = 11 – d). By comparing our gap with the opponent’s gap (which is 17 – x) we find that when d is larger, our chance to “beat” the opponent improves notably. By computing the expected outcome across all potential safe cards and factoring in the bust probabilities, the overall expected score when hitting comes out around 0.70 points, which is considerably higher than when we stand.\n\nTherefore, the best move in this situation is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Let's analyze the situation.\n\nYour current hand is ['K', '3', '5'] which totals 21. The threshold is N = 27. You already hit once in Turn 1 and now it’s Turn 2. The opponent’s visible card is '10' (worth 10) and the unknown card will add to give him a total between 11 and 23 (10 + Ace up to 10 + K).\n\nIf you Stand with 21, the opponent’s final totals (with equal chance for each card from an infinite deck) will be:\n • 11–20 (if his hidden card is Ace through 10) – you win because your 21 is closer to 27.\n • 21 (if his hidden card is J, value 11) – that ties 21 to 21 (a draw).\n • 22 or 23 (if his hidden card is Q or K, respectively) – the opponent wins as his total is closer to 27.\n\nThat gives you a win in 10 out of 13 cases, a draw in 1 case, and a loss in 2 cases. In expected score terms, that is:\n Expected score = (10\/13 × 1) + (1\/13 × 0.5) ≈ 0.8077.\n\nNow, if you Hit (take another card from an infinite deck), the safe draw is one that does not exceed the threshold:\n Current total = 21, so you can only safely add a card of value 6 or less (Ace=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6), which occur with probability 6\/13.\n If you hit and get a safe card:\n  • If you draw a card of value 1, your total becomes 22 (difference from 27: 5).\n  • If you draw 2, total becomes 23 (gap = 4).\n  • 3 gives 24 (gap = 3); 4 gives 25 (gap = 2); 5 gives 26 (gap = 1); 6 gives 27 (perfect 0 gap).\nFor each safe total, the opponent’s final total (10 plus his unknown card) would be compared by how close it is to 27. In every safe outcome the chance of winning improves compared to 21—especially with totals 24 and higher—but you only get a safe outcome in 6\/13 cases.\n The remaining 7\/13 probability results in a bust (exceeding 27) and thus an automatic loss.\nA detailed calculation shows that hitting leads to an overall expected score of roughly 0.45, which is significantly lower than the nearly 0.81 you secure by standing.\n\nThus, the optimal decision in this round is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the game history and the rules, your current total (20 from '9' + 'J' where J = 11) is considerably below the threshold (40). In all previous rounds the opponent has stood immediately, so his total remains just the sum of his two cards. In this round his known card is ‘7’ and his other card is unknown (drawn uniformly from an infinite deck with values from 1 [Ace] to 13 [K]). That means his possible totals range from 8 to 20 with 20 only occurring if he has a 13. Standing on your 20 gives you a very strong chance to win because if his total is less than 20 you win, and if it equals 20 it’s a draw.\n\nHowever, by hitting you have a chance to improve your total safely. Given that the highest card is 13, even if you hit and get a 13 your total becomes 33, which is still far from the threshold. Increasing your total improves your “closeness to N = 40” margin while still keeping you under the bust limit. Since the opponent always stands, there’s no risk he will improve his total by drawing extra cards.\n\nConsidering the risk\/reward trade‐off—with little risk of busting given the high threshold—and the opportunity to close the gap to 40 further, the optimal move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the rules and the current situation, here’s the reasoning:\n\n• The threshold (N) is 40.\n• Your current total is 26 (from ['9', 'J', '6']).\n• Your opponent’s face‐up card is 7 and the second card is hidden; since the opponent always stands on their initial hand, their total will be 7 plus the hidden card. The maximum card value is 13 (K), so the opponent’s total will be at most 20.\n• In the settlement, if both totals are under or equal to 40, the side “closest to 40” wins. With your current total of 26, you are 14 away from 40, and even in the worst case the opponent’s total will be at most 20 (which is 20 away from 40). This guarantees your win.\n• Although you could safely hit (since even a maximum hit of 13 would bring you to 39, still under 40), there is no need to risk drawing another card when you already hold a winning advantage.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current game situation, you only have a total of 8 (from your cards '5' and '3') against a threshold of 33. Since the opponent’s fixed strategy in previous rounds has been to take no additional cards beyond their initial two (with the visible card being '8' now and an unknown second card), their final total will be 8 plus the value of the unknown card, which could be anywhere between 1 and 13. That means their total will likely fall between 9 and 21.\n\nYour current total of 8 is very low compared to the threshold, and you have plenty of margin before the risk of busting (exceeding 33) becomes an issue—even drawing the highest card (13) only brings you to 21. Therefore, to have a competitive chance later in the round, the best move is to request an additional card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round details:\n\n• You currently have a total of 21 from your cards: 5, 3, and K (K = 13).\n• The threshold (N) is 33.\n• Your opponent’s face‐up card is 8 while the face‐down card (drawn uniformly from the 13 card types) is unknown. This means his total will be 8 plus a card value between 1 (Ace) and 13 (King), hence his total ranges from 9 to 21.\n• Your opponent’s fixed strategy is to stand immediately, so his final total will be in that range.\n\nIf you choose to stand with a total of 21:\n – Your opponent wins if his total is less than 21? No—the rule states the side closer to 33 wins. Since your opponent’s maximum possible total is 21, standing with 21 means:\n  ○ If his unknown card gives him a total less than 21 (values 1–12, probability 12\/13), you win.\n  ○ If his unknown card is a King (value 13, probability 1\/13), his total equals 21 and the round results in a draw.\n  ○ Your expected score then is (12\/13)*1 + (1\/13)*0.5 ≈ 0.9615.\n\nIf you choose to hit:\n – Your current total is 21 and you add one card.\n – To remain under or equal to 33, you must draw a card with a value from 1 to 12 (safe zone); drawing a 13 will put you at 34—which busts.\n – The probability of drawing a safe card is 12\/13 (≈92.3%) and probability of busting is 1\/13 (≈7.7%).\n – If you safely hit, your total will be between 22 and 33, which is higher than any opponent total (maximum is 21), meaning a win.\n – Your expected score for hitting is (12\/13)*1 + (1\/13)*0 = ≈0.9231.\n\nSince standing gives an expected score of about 0.9615, which is slightly higher than the 0.9231 from hitting, you should not risk drawing another card.\n\nAnswer: Stand","My analysis is as follows:\n\n• With a threshold of 30 and your current visible total of 17, standing would leave you with 17 while the opponent’s (hidden) card (with a known card of 9) gives them a total between 10 and 22. In that situation, if you stand at 17 your chance to win is only good if the opponent’s second card comes out very low. A quick breakdown shows that standing gives you a win probability of roughly 54% (with 7\/13 chance) plus a small chance of a draw (~8%), and around a 38% chance to lose.\n\n• By choosing to hit, since your total is 17 and the maximum card value is 13, any one additional card will be safe (i.e. you cannot bust immediately because 17 plus any card 1–13 is at most 30). In fact, if you hit once your new total will be 17 + x (with x uniformly from 1 to 13), which ranges from 18 to 30. For each resulting total, your chance of beating the opponent (who will stick automatically with 9 + his unknown card) increases dramatically – in many cases (when you draw a higher card) you will have a total that is closer to the threshold (30) than the opponent ever can be.\n\n• A quick computation for a single hit yields an average win probability of about 93% (when averaging over all possible hit outcomes), which is far superior to standing on 17.\n\nThus, based on this reasoning and comparing the expected outcomes, the optimal move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is 21 and you are playing under a threshold of 30. Your opponent already stood on turn 1 and will reveal a second card next that will give them a total of 9 plus the unknown card’s value. Looking at past rounds, your opponent always stands immediately; hence their total will be 9 plus a card value between 1 (for Ace) and 13 (for King), giving them a range from 10 to 22. By standing with 21, you will win if the opponent’s total is less than 21 (which happens in 11 out of 13 cases), tie if they get exactly 21 (1 out of 13), and lose if they get a 22 (1 out of 13). This gives a standing chance with an expected score of about 0.8846 (1 score for win, 0.5 for a tie, 0 for loss).\n\nIf you choose to hit, you risk drawing one of the “busting” cards. With a total of 21 and a limit of 30, only cards with a value of 9 or less will keep you safe (since 21 + 9 = 30). There are 9 safe cards out of 13 and 4 cards (10, J, Q, K) that would immediately bust you. Even if you get a safe card, many will only slightly improve your total (for example, drawing an Ace will leave you at 22 which gives you a slightly better chance against the opponent, but not as good as an automatic win). A quick expected-value calculation shows the EV if you hit would be about 0.69, which is lower than the 0.8846 EV if you stand.\n\nThus, the optimal decision with a total of 21 against an opponent who stands immediately under a threshold of 30 is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation, your total is only 18 while the opponent’s visible card is Q (worth 12) and their hidden card (drawn uniformly from all 13 possibilities) will make their total between 13 and 25. Note that since the game’s win is determined by having the highest total (without exceeding the threshold) and the opponent will never hit beyond their initial two cards, you want to get above the maximum possible opponent total (which is 25) so you win regardless of what the opponent has.\n\nBecause the threshold is high (45), you have almost no risk of busting on at least a few extra draws. In fact, if you decide to hit until you have at least 26 then you guarantee victory no matter what the opponent’s unknown card is (since even the best opponent total of 25 will lose against 26 or more). With your current total of 18, if you stand now you only win if the opponent’s total is less than 18. That happens only if their hidden card is one of {A (1), 2, 3, 4, 5} (a probability of 5\/13) and you'll at best tie (if they total 18) or lose in most cases. This expected outcome is poor.\n\nGiven the safe conditions (no bust risk at 18 with one more card) and the fact that drawing a card of 8 or higher (values 8, 9, 10, J, Q, or K) would immediately take you to at least 26 (18+8=26), it makes sense to hit immediately. Even if you get a low card (Ace through 7) keeping you below 26, you can hit again; until you eventually reach a total of 26 or more, which would ensure you win as the opponent’s maximum possible total is 25.\n\nTherefore, your optimal move on Turn 1 is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round, your total is 31 while the threshold is 45. Your opponent already stood with a visible Q (worth 12) and has an unknown hole card, making his total likely much lower than 31. Since every card drawn from the infinite deck has a value between 1 and 13, if you choose to hit now your total will become 31 plus an additional score between 1 and 13, which will always be 44 or less—so you cannot bust by hitting. In fact, any hit will bring you closer to 45, thereby reducing the gap from the threshold compared to your current gap of 14 (45 – 31).\n\nGiven that even the worst-case hit (drawing an Ace, giving you a total of 32) would improve your position and that the opponent’s best possible total in his two cards (with a Q showing) would be significantly lower than any safe total you can achieve, the optimal strategy is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your current total is 42 and the threshold is 45, you have only 3 points of leeway. If you choose to Hit, only an Ace (1), 2, or 3 would keep you at or below 45. That gives you a safe chance of only 3 out of 13 possible card outcomes. With the risk of busting being high (10 out of 13 outcomes would exceed 45), standing is clearly the safer and optimal move. Since the opponent's final total will be 12 (from their face-up Q) plus the unknown card—which will be much lower than 42 regardless—standing guarantees a win. \n\nAnswer: Stand","Your current total is 15 (2 + K), and the threshold N is 28. If you stand now, you’d have 15 and the opponent’s total will be 3 plus a hidden card (a value between 1 and 13). That would give your opponent a total between 4 and 16. When comparing totals that haven’t exceeded 28, the side closer to 28 wins. Standing at 15 gives you a distance of 13 from 28, and the opponent’s distance will range from 12 (if the hidden card is 13) to 24 (if it’s 1). In that case, you win only if the opponent’s total is less than 15 (or exactly 15 to draw), which – when worked out over the 13 possible card values – yields an expected score of roughly 0.8846.\n\nIf you choose to hit, you add a new card value v (from 1 to 13) to your current 15, making your new total 15 + v. Notice that even if you draw the highest card (v = 13), your total becomes 28 exactly, so you won’t bust. Then, your “distance” from 28 becomes 13 – v. When the opponent’s total is 3 plus their unknown card u, you win if 15 + v is closer to 28 than 3 + u, or equivalently if u is less than 12 + v, tie if u equals 12 + v, and lose if u is greater (with u only ranging from 1 to 13). For v = 1, your win probability is 12\/13 with a 1\/13 chance for a draw. For any v ≥ 2, the hidden card cannot reach 12 + v (since 12 + v would be at least 14 and the maximum u is 13), so you win outright. Averaging these outcomes over the uniformly likely 13 card values gives an expected score very close to 0.997.\n\nSince 0.997 > 0.8846, it is best to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round, your total is 17 and the threshold is 28. Your opponent’s visible card is 3 and the face‐down card is unknown. Given that your opponent always stands immediately, their total will be 3 plus the value of the unknown card. Since card values range from 1 to 13, the highest possible opponent total is 3 + 13 = 16, and in every case their total will be lower than 17. In this game the winner is determined by which total is closer to 28. Standing at 17 gives a difference of 11 (28 – 17), while any successful hit (drawing a card worth at most 11) would give you a total between 18 and 28, with differences that are even lower. However, hitting carries a risk: if you draw a card valued at 12 (Q) or 13 (K), you would exceed the threshold (17 + 12 = 29, or 17 + 13 = 30) and automatically lose. Since there are 13 possible card types and only 11 are safe (values 1 through 11), there’s about a 2\/13 chance (~15.4%) of busting if you hit. \n\nConsidering that if you stand your hand (17) is already guaranteed to beat any possible opponent total (which is between 4 and 16), the safest and winning move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

With such a low total relative to the threshold, hitting is strongly advisable to improve your hand before the opponent’s turn. Therefore, based on the situation, you should choose to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, your current total is 29 and the threshold is 35. If you hit, you risk busting with any card of value 7 or higher. Since there are 13 possible outcomes (values 1–13) and only card values 1–6 are safe, you have approximately a 6\/13 chance of improving your total and a 7\/13 chance of busting. Additionally, the opponent’s visible card is a K (13) and their unknown card, drawn from an infinite deck, will yield a total between 14 and 26 when added to 13. This means that by standing at 29 you are already ahead of any possible opponent total. Therefore, hitting only introduces unnecessary risk and would lower your expected score compared to the sure win from standing.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current state, your total is 15 while the threshold is 27. With 15, you have plenty of “room” to draw a card since only drawing a card valued 13 (a King) would immediately bust you (15 + 13 = 28, which is over 27), and that has an approximate probability of 1\/13 (~7.7%). Drawing any card with a value from 1 to 12 will leave you safely under or equal to 27, allowing you to approach the threshold more competitively against the opponent’s unknown second card. Considering you need to get as close to 27 as possible to beat the opponent when both play close to that limit, it is advisable to take the risk.\n\nThus, the best move in this situation is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the records so far the opponent always seems to stand right away, regardless of the total they get from their first two cards. In the current round the opponent’s visible card is a 4 and his unknown card will be drawn from an infinite uniform deck so his total will be 4 plus a card between 1 and 13—that is, ranging from 5 to 17. Your current total is 18, which already beats any possible outcome the opponent can get if he simply stands. Also, with a threshold (N) of 33 you can safely hit (since 18+max(13)=31 would not exceed 33), but because the opponent isn’t taking any risk and his total is capped at 17, there is no need to improve your already winning score by risking additional hits that might unnecessarily complicate the situation if there were any unforeseen factors.\n\nThus, by standing immediately you secure a win in this round.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the game situation, here’s the reasoning:\n\nOur total is 18 (6 + Q where Q is 12). The threshold (N) is 48. The opponent’s visible card is a 3 and the hidden card is unknown; since the opponent always stands (as seen from the history) his final total will be 3 plus the unknown card. The maximum possible value for a card is 13 (for a King), so the opponent’s total can be at most 3 + 13 = 16. That means whether the hidden card is very low or high, the opponent’s total will be less than our 18 if we do nothing further.\n\nSince the winner is the one whose total is closer to N (48) without going over, and because 18 is higher than any possible total the opponent can have (4 to 16), standing with 18 guarantees that our total is closer to 48. This means if we choose to Stand, no matter what the opponent’s hidden card is, we win the round.\n\nThus, the best move in this situation is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current game situation, your total is only 12 (with cards '3' and '9') while the threshold is 50. Meanwhile, the opponent’s only visible card is 'J' (which is worth 11) and his second card is unknown. Looking at the history, your opponent never took a hit—he always stood immediately. This indicates that his final total will be the sum of his 'J' (11) plus his hidden card (which could range from 1 to 13). This means his overall total will fall somewhere between 12 and 24. In contrast, your total of 12 is far too low when aiming to approach the threshold 50, and you have plenty of room to improve without worrying about busting (since the maximum card value is 13 and even 3 or 4 hits would be very safe).\n\nGiven that your goal is to come as close as possible to 50 without going over, and considering your opponent’s likely modest final total, the optimal move is to “hit” and continue drawing cards. This gives you the opportunity to build a much higher sum—one that can beat your opponent’s relatively low total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your total is currently 13 and the dealer’s face‐up card is a J (worth 11) with an unknown second card, the dealer’s final total will be the sum of 11 plus a random card that can be as high as 13 (thus, at most 24). Since you win whenever your total is higher than the dealer’s (while not exceeding 50) and the dealer always stops with just the initial two cards, you want to reach at least 25. With your current total well below that target and with almost no risk of busting on additional hits (because even the highest card of 13 would only bring you to 26), the optimal move is to hit. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that if you stand now your total is only 16 while your opponent has already stopped with two cards (one face‐up J and one unknown card which will be between 1 and 13, making his total between 12 and 24), you have a lot of room until you get close to the threshold of 50. Since you’re far away from 50 and there is no risk of busting on this hit (because even the highest card, 13, added to 16 gives 29, still far below 50), you should take an extra card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, your total is 22 and the opponent’s known card is a Jack (11). Because the opponent’s secret card is drawn from an infinite deck (values 1–13) and their fixed strategy is to stand immediately, the opponent’s final total can only be between 12 (if the secret card is an Ace) and 24 (if the secret card is a King). If you were to stand with 22, you would win when the opponent’s total is in the range 12–21 (10 out of 13 possibilities), tie when it is 22 (1 out of 13), and lose when it is 23 or 24 (2 out of 13). That gives you an average expected win\/draw rate of roughly 80.8%.\n\nSince the threshold is 50 and your current sum is only 22, you have plenty of “room” to take an extra hit—drawing any card (values between 1 and 13) would bring your total to between 23 and 35, which is still far from busting. Moreover, achieving a total higher than 24 secures a win regardless of what the opponent’s secret card is. Therefore, to improve your chance to safely beat any possible opponent total, you should take another card rather than standing with 22.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is 24 while the opponent shows an 11. Since the opponent always stands after the initial deal, his final total will be 11 plus his hidden card—ranging from 12 (if it’s an Ace) to 24 (if it’s a King). In other words, if you were to stand now with 24 you might tie if his unknown card is a King (value 13), since 11+13 equals 24. \n\nHowever, if you choose to hit, any card you draw (values 1 through 13) will add at least 1 point to your 24, making your new total at least 25. This guarantees that no matter what his second card is (since his maximum possible total is 24), you will always have a higher score. And because the threshold is 50, hitting once is risk‐free (even adding the highest card, 13, yields 24+13 = 37, which is safely below 50).\n\nThus, the optimal strategy is to hit once more now and then stand. This move guarantees a win for the round.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the game progress and current round details, here’s the reasoning:\n\n• Your current total is 33 and the threshold is 50. With card values ranging from 1 to 13, even the worst possible card (13) would bring your total to 46, which is still under 50. There’s no immediate bust risk.\n\n• The opponent’s strategy is fixed—they always stand and finish with only two cards (one known 'J' and one unknown). Their total will be much lower than what you can eventually reach.\n\n• Since the settlement favors the side closer to 50 (if both are under the threshold) and you’re currently far enough from 50, it’s best to hit and improve your score. The likelihood of busting on the next draw is zero because 33 + 13 = 46 < 50.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move at this turn is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the rules and the current situation, your total is 44 and the threshold N is 50. If you choose to hit, you risk drawing a card that might push you over 50. In an infinite deck where every card type is equally likely (each of the 13 types with values 1, 2, 3, …, 10, 11, 12, 13), only cards with a value of 6 or less will not cause you to bust (since 44 + 7 = 51, which exceeds 50). That means your chance of drawing a safe card is 6\/13 (about 46%), while with 7\/13 chance you would bust immediately.\n\nThe opponent’s strategy is fixed—they always stand. Their one visible card is \"J\" (valued at 11) and their face-down card is unknown. This means that the opponent’s total will be 11 plus whatever card they got (which can be at most 13, so their maximum total is 24). Even if you stand now with 44, you are overwhelmingly ahead because the opponent’s total will be substantially lower than yours, and since the winner is the one closest to 50 without exceeding it, you already secure the win by standing.\n\nSince standing gives you a win (1 point), and hitting carries a high risk of immediate loss (0 points if you bust), the optimal decision in this situation is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given that your total is currently only 9 and the target (N) is 44, you are extremely far from getting close to the threshold. Meanwhile, the opponent’s face-up card is a 4, and based on previous rounds the opponent always stands immediately. This means the opponent’s total is fixed (the face-up 4 plus their hidden card) and is unlikely to be anywhere near 44. Since the outcome is decided in favor of whoever is closer to 44 (without exceeding it), you have plenty of room to safely hit in order to improve your total. Standing with 9 guarantees that you’ll be much further from 44 than your opponent, leading you to lose. Therefore, it is best to request another card (Hit) and build up your total gradually toward the threshold.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your current total is only 11 and the threshold is 44, you have plenty of room to improve your hand. Your opponent’s visible card is 4 and his hidden card is unknown; his likely total is between 5 and 17. Since he has already stood and his total is likely low, you’re in a situation where you need to build a competitive hand to beat him. There is little risk of busting right now because even drawing a high card (up to 13) won’t put you anywhere near 44. Thus, you should continue to build your total by taking another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the current situation, your total is 12 and you are far below the threshold of 44. Since the opponent’s two‐card total (with one card shown as “4” and the hidden card unknown) will almost certainly stay well below 31, it makes sense to improve your position. Moreover, any hit when your total is 12 is risk‐free because even drawing the maximum value (13) would only bring you to 25, still far from busting. In fact, as long as your total is 31 or less, every card (with a max of 13) you could draw is “safe” – you won’t exceed 44 by hitting. \n\nSince your goal is to be as close to 44 as possible (to beat an opponent who is very likely to have a much lower total because their two cards will add up to at most 17 if they hold low cards), the optimal move is to request another card. \n\nThus, on Turn 3, you should choose to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round’s data, we have a threshold of 44 and our total is only 14 (from cards ['3', '6', '2', 'A', '2']). Meanwhile, the opponent’s face-up is a 4 and they will always stand—so their final total will be 4 plus the unknown card (which can be any value from 1 to 13, giving totals from 5 to 17). Since the winning condition is based on the total being as close to 44 as possible without exceeding it, if we stand at 14 our difference from 44 is 30, while the opponent’s difference will be between 27 and 39 (depending on the unknown card drawn). In many cases the opponent will be closer to 44.\n\nGiven that our current total is very low and we have plenty of room before reaching 44 (we can add up to 30 points safely), it is clearly beneficial to take an additional card (Hit) to raise our total closer to 44. That extra card (and likely more in subsequent turns) can significantly improve our chances since the opponent is stuck with a relatively low total between 5 and 17.\n\nThus, the optimal move in this turn is to \"Hit\".\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the analysis:\n\n• In this round, the threshold (N) is 44 and your current total is 27.\n• The opponent’s face‐up card is a 4, and they always stand, so their final total will be 4 plus an unknown card (ranging from 1 to 13), which puts them well below 27.\n• With your total at 27 and plenty of room (44 – 27 = 17 points) before risking a bust, any new card (its maximum value is 13) can be added safely.\n• To be closer to 44 and secure a win (because winning is determined by being closer to N than the opponent), you should hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current situation, our total is 33 while the threshold is 44. Since the opponent will always stand and his hand (with a visible 4 and a hidden card) will always be much lower (ranging from 5 to 17), even though our total 33 is far from 44, it is much closer than what the opponent can achieve. \n\nIf we choose to hit, we risk busting; any card with a value of 12 or 13 (Q or K) would take our total above 44. There are 2 “dangerous” card values out of 13 possible cards (about a 15% chance) which could bust us. On the other hand, if we stand, our total of 33 will always win against the opponent’s relatively low score. \n\nThus, the optimal strategy for this turn is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given that our current total is 13 with a threshold (N) of 28, and the opponent always stands immediately, our objective is to get as close to 28 as possible without going over. Standing at 13 would be too low, and because any card drawn (with values between 1 and 13) will not immediately put us over 28 (since 13 + 13 = 26, which is still under 28), it makes sense to take another card now. Thus, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the situation, your total is 26 and the threshold is 28. If you hit, only an Ace (1 point) or a “2” (2 points) keeps you safe, as any other card would push your total above 28 and cause you to bust. With an infinite deck assumed, that’s only 2 out of 13 possible cards, meaning an 11\/13 chance to bust. On the other hand, the opponent’s face‐up card is 9 and their face-down card is unknown. However, the opponent’s fixed strategy is to stand immediately. This means the opponent's total will be 9 plus the unknown card’s value. Since the highest card value is 13 (for a King), the opponent’s maximum total is 9 + 13 = 22, which is lower than your 26.\n\nThus, if you stand with 26, you will win regardless of the opponent’s unknown card. In comparison, taking another hit carries a very high risk of busting with little benefit. The optimal play is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation, your total is 8 (with cards [6, 2]) and the threshold is 28. Meanwhile, your opponent shows a 10 and their hidden card is unknown, but given their fixed strategy of immediately standing, they will finish with a two‐card total. Since even the highest possible opponent total is 10 + 13 = 23 and the expected average total is around 17, you have a lot of room to draw additional cards without busting. At 8, you’re far below the threshold, so it is optimal for you to take another card (i.e. Hit) to build your total closer to 28 and to beat the opponent’s likely total. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation in Round 8, our total is 14 and the threshold is 28. With an infinite deck and the card values (minimum 1 and maximum 13), any additional card will bring our total to at most 14 + 13 = 27, which is still safely under the threshold. Also, observing the history, our opponent always stands on the initial two cards. Since the opponent’s face‐up card is \"10\" and they do not hit, they are likely to remain far from the threshold if their other card is low. However, our current total of 14 is too far from 28 to safely stand and hope to beat the opponent once both cards are revealed. \n\nThus, it is optimal to request another card (Hit) in order to get closer to the threshold and improve our winning chances.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, you currently have a total of 21 and the threshold is 28. Since the opponent always stands (as shown in all previous rounds) and his known face‐up card is a 10 with an unknown second card, if you stand at 21 your final result will be compared against his (10 + unknown). In that case, his total can be anywhere between 11 and 23. If you stand, you win in every outcome except for the very few cases where his unknown card is high enough (12 or 13) or ties exactly (an 11) with your 21. (Specifically, if his unknown card is 1–10 you win, if it is 11 you get a draw, and if it is 12 or 13 you lose. This gives you roughly a win chance of 10\/13, draw of 1\/13, and loss of 2\/13 – an expected round score of about 0.81.)\n\nIf instead you choose to hit, you must add a drawn card’s value to your 21; you cannot afford to exceed 28, so only a card of value 7 or less (7 out of 13 equally likely outcomes) is “safe.” For example, drawing a 1 (Ace) bumps you to 22, which although closer to 28, gives you a 22–28 difference of 6. Against the opponent’s range (10 + unknown), the win\/draw\/lose probabilities are then re‐calculated; for a 22 you’d win when the unknown card is 1–11 (win probability 11\/13), tie if it’s 12 (1\/13), and lose if it’s 13 (1\/13). Other safe draws (2–7) have similar or even better prospects because they get you closer to 28. However, if you draw an 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, or 13 (6\/13 chance) you bust and immediately lose the round. The overall expected outcome when hitting, after averaging all possibilities, turns out to be lower (around an expected score of 0.53) than standing (about 0.81).\n\nTherefore, the better decision in this situation is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on analyzing our situation (our total is 9 with N = 27) and “solving” the decision problem recursively, our optimal strategy is to try to get as close as possible to 27 without exceeding it. The opponent’s strategy has been to stand immediately on the initial deal; since their only visible card is a J (worth 11 points) and their hidden card is randomly drawn from an infinite deck with uniform probabilities for values 1 (Ace) up to 13 (K), the opponent’s final total will be 11 plus a uniformly distributed number from 1 to 13 (ranging from 12 up to 24). In contrast, our total of 9 is very low. \n\nA detailed backward analysis shows that if we stand with a total of 9 our win chance would be 0 (because 9 is too far from 27, and the opponent’s guaranteed total is at least 12). Meanwhile, using a dynamic‐programming–style analysis over totals from 9 upward (by comparing the win probability if we “stand” immediately at a given total versus taking a “hit” and then playing optimally) shows that our maximum win chance starting at 9 is approximately 70%. In other words, from a total of 9, the best move is to ask for additional cards (“hit”).\n\nThus, in the current round the best move is:\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation we’re in now, our total is only 13 (with cards 3, 6, 4) while the threshold is 27. Meanwhile, the dealer’s visible card is J (worth 11) and the second card is unknown. Reviewing the history, we see that the opponent always stands immediately on their turn. In other words, the opponent’s final total will simply be the sum of the J (11) and whatever the face‐down card is (which, coming from an infinite deck in which every card type is equally likely among 13 possibilities, has an expected value of 7). So their expected total is about 18, though it can vary from 12 (if the hidden card is an Ace) up to 24 (if it’s a King). \n\nAt our current total of 13 we have ample room (27−13 = 14 points) to take a hit without any risk of busting on this card draw (since the maximum card value is 13). Getting closer to 27 is important here because if we stop too low our probability of beating the opponent’s likely total falls. Since our opponent never hits and always ends with their initial two cards, our best strategy is to continue hitting until we can get as close to 27 as possible (while bearing in mind that risk of overshooting increases as our total gets higher). In the current turn, having just taken our first hit, the optimal move is to hit again. \n\nThus, the best move now is to request an additional card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the analysis of the current round (Threshold = 27, your total = 15 versus an opponent holding a J and an unknown card who already stands), the best decision is to take another card (Hit).\n\nHere’s the reasoning in brief:\n• With a total of 15, you have room to draw a card as long as it isn’t too high. Only drawing a card worth 13 (a King) would immediately push you over 27.\n• The opponent’s only revealed card is a J (11), and since they already stood, their total will be 11 plus an unknown value between 1 and 13. This means their possible totals range between 12 and 24—all safely under 27.\n• If you stand at 15, your distance from the threshold is 12, which is worse compared to many likely opponent totals.\n• By hitting, you have roughly a 12\/13 chance to avoid busting and will likely bring your total closer to 27. A careful expected score calculation (taking into account win, draw, and bust outcomes) shows that hitting now yields a much higher expected round score than standing.\n\nThus, the best move in the current round is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on a look‐ahead analysis, you’re currently at a total of 19 with threshold N = 27. If you stand now your win chance (given the dealer’s fixed two‐card hand with a known “J” and an unknown card) is about 57.7% (because the dealer’s score will be 11 + X with X uniformly 1–13, and you win if 11 + X < 19). On the other hand, if you hit, you have a 5\/13 chance (drawing a 9, 10, J, Q or K) of busting immediately. For the safe draws (cards 1–8) you would improve to totals from 20 up to 27, but even then the optimal follow‐up strategy is to stand; a dynamic programming analysis shows that the expected win probability from 19 when you hit is lower (about 54%) than if you simply stand.\n\nThus, your best move in this round is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current round, your total is only 9, and the threshold is 26. The opponent’s face‐up card is a Q (worth 12 points) and he always stands immediately, meaning his final total will be 12 plus his unknown card (which, on average, gives about 7 more points to reach roughly 19). Standing on 9 would almost certainly lose since the opponent’s minimum would be 13 and likely be higher than 9. In addition, when you hit with a total of 9, any card drawn (the highest being 13) will not cause you to bust because 9+13=22, which is still below the threshold of 26. Therefore, to improve your chances of getting closer to 26 (and ideally surpassing the opponent’s expected total), the optimal move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is 14 out of a maximum of 26. In every previous round the opponent has always taken a stand immediately (their move remains fixed), and their face‐up card is Q (worth 12), while the face‐down card is unknown. Since the opponent never risks busting, their final total will always be at least 13 (if the unknown card is 1) and at most 25 (if it is 13). With a total of only 14, you are very far from the threshold; you have room to safely take an extra card. Drawing a new card has only a 1 in 13 chance of busting (if you draw a K, which would bring your total to 27), and in most cases the new card will bring you closer to 26. Thus, the statistically better move is to request another card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the analysis, if you choose to draw an extra card (Hit), there is a 7\/13 chance of busting (since any card with a value greater than 6 will cause your total to go over 26), and the expected outcome when you safely draw (card 1–6) is lower than if you stay with 20. By standing at 20, you win against the opponent if their face‐down card (with the shown Q worth 12) makes their total 20 or less (a draw if it’s exactly 20, and a loss if it is higher); when we work through the probabilities (taking all 13 equally likely possibilities of the unknown card), the expected round score when standing is approximately 0.577, which is higher than the approximately 0.388 expected score if you hit.\n\nThus, the best move for the player in Turn 3 is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Your opponent’s visible card is a 5, and you’re unaware of their hidden card, but with a total of 15 there is a relatively large margin before you risk busting. With the deck being infinite and the maximum card value being 13, you have ample room to draw additional cards without immediately risking a bust. Therefore, the best move is to request another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current board, you have a total of 25 and the threshold is 41. The worst possible card value is 13 (for a King), which would only bring your total to 38 (25+13), still under 41. This means that, regardless of what card you draw, you cannot bust immediately. In addition, the expected value of a drawn card is 7 (since (1+2+…+13)\/13 = 7), which would bring your total closer to 41. Given that you can safely draw an extra card without the risk of immediate bust and you have plenty of room to improve your score relative to the threshold, the best decision is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our analysis, we’re at a current total of 29 while the limit is 41. Drawing another card has only a 1 in 13 chance of busting (drawing a King, which is worth 13 points, would result in 29 + 13 = 42 > 41). In all other cases, our total improves, bringing us closer to 41. Since being closer to 41 without busting increases our chances against the opponent—who has already taken two hits—it makes sense to ask for another card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, you’re sitting at a total of 31 points with a threshold of 41. This means you have a 10‐point “safety cushion” before you’d bust. When you hit, you get a card drawn uniformly among the 13 ranks (each rank having a 1\/13 probability), and the safe card values (those ≤10) form 10 of the 13 outcomes. In other words, you have a roughly 10\/13 chance (about 77%) to get a card that takes you to a new total between 32 and 41, which gives you a stronger hand closer to the threshold. The remaining 3\/13 chance (about 23%) would take you over if you draw a card with value 11 (J), 12 (Q), or 13 (K).\n\nConsidering that the opponent’s play remains fixed and may aim to get closer to the threshold too, your hand of 31 is relatively weak when compared with the potential hands that can be safely achieved by hitting. Accepting a 23% bust risk in order to push your total closer to 41 is a reasonable risk to maximize your chance of winning the round.\n\nThus, the optimal move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 41, which is exactly the threshold (N = 41), taking another card would definitely push your total over 41 and result in a bust. Since there's no possibility of improving your score without risking a loss, the optimal move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on our current situation, our total is only 11 while the threshold is 36. We’re very far from the limit, so we have plenty of room to safely draw more cards. In addition, the opponent shows only a 3, and while we don’t know the hidden card, the history shows that when the opponent did hit (even with a higher threshold) his final sum wasn’t very close to his limit. This suggests that his fixed strategy likely involves being cautious with the risk of going over the threshold. With our extremely low total, it makes sense to try to build a stronger hand before we get near 36. Therefore, our best move in the current round is to ask for an additional card—that is, we should Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current hand of 20 (from cards 8, 3, and 9) and knowing that no single additional card—even the highest‐value K (13)—will bring you over the threshold of 36 (since 20 + 13 = 33), the safest decision in this situation is to ask for another card. In other words, you should choose to “hit.”\n\nSince you’re well below 36 and there’s no danger of busting with one extra card, a hit gives you a chance to increase your total closer to 36. Moreover, your opponent’s previous behavior (hitting four times before standing in Round 1) suggests that they are likely to gather a total that might already be near 30 or more. Standing with a total of 20 would provide little competitive advantage.\n\nThus, the optimal strategy here is Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current game situation:\n• Your cards add up to 32, and your threshold is 36.\n• If you hit, you can only safely draw cards with a value of 1 (Ace), 2, 3, or 4. There are 4 safe outcomes among 13 possibilities, giving you roughly a 30% chance to remain safe and a roughly 70% chance to bust.\n• Standing gives you a total of 32. Although it is a few points below the maximum safe score (36), the high bust risk if you hit makes hitting very dangerous.\n• Considering that your opponent’s strategy in the previous round involved taking several hits, their score might be lower if they bust or, if they stop, may still lose if you win by being closer to 36 without busting.\n• With a 70% risk of busting by hitting and only a 30% chance to improve without busting, standing is the safer play.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation, you currently have a low total (9 out of a threshold of 24) and plenty of room to improve before risking going over. In previous rounds you took hits until your total was in a winning range relative to the threshold. Also, the dealer’s face‐up card (a 10) suggests the opponent might have a relatively high final sum if they hit aggressively with their fixed strategy.\n\nThus, to have a competitive hand and aim to get close to 24 while still avoiding busting, the optimal move now is to request another card (\"Hit\").\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, you have a total of 19 and the round’s threshold is 24. In other words, you are 5 points shy of the “perfect” total. Even though hitting comes with the risk of busting (since any drawn card with value 6 or more will put you over 24), the probability of drawing a safe card (an Ace up through a 5) is 5\/13 – roughly 38%. Standing on 19 is a relatively weak position when the opponent (with a showing 10 and already having taken one hit) can potentially improve his total while remaining safely under 24. In past rounds the opponent has shown a tendency to hit when his total is far from the threshold, so if you stand on 19 you might well end up losing if the opponent manages an innocuous improvement.\n\nGiven that the expected benefit of getting closer to 24 (with totals 20–24 giving you a better chance to win) outweighs the risk even with a significant chance to bust, the best move is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the game state, our total is only 14 while the threshold is 42. Since there is a wide margin before risking exceeding the threshold (even drawing the highest‐value card of 13 would only bring us to 27), we should take another card to have a chance to get closer to 42 and beat the opponent’s eventual sum. Thus, in this situation the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round, you have a total of 25 points (from K = 13, A = 1, and J = 11) with a threshold of 42. That means you still have 17 points of “room” (42 – 25 = 17) before busting. Since all cards have values between 1 and 13, any additional card you draw will add at most 13 points, keeping you safe for this hit. Meanwhile, the opponent’s visible card is an A (worth 1) and, judging by previous rounds, their fixed strategy tends to keep them well below the threshold most of the time or even over in some lower‐threshold rounds where a draw is the result. \n\nGiven that your current total is somewhat low relative to the threshold, and to be competitive against the opponent’s expected total (which appears to often be in the twenties or thirties), it is strategically best to try and improve your score. Therefore, the best move is to request an additional card – that is, choose to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analyzing the current round with threshold 42:\n• Your total is 28, and you have room up to 42 (a gap of 14), so no matter which card (values 1 to 13) you draw, you cannot bust.\n• Increasing your total will bring you closer to 42, making it more likely to win against your opponent, whose fixed strategy appears to involve stopping after a couple of hits.\n• With the safety of the gap (14 points) and the desire to beat the opponent’s likely lower total, the optimal decision is to take another card (“Hit”).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current cards, you have a total of 40 with the threshold at 42. If you choose to take another card (Hit), you must add a card with a value no greater than 2—notably only an Ace (1 point) or a 2 (2 points) will keep you at or under the threshold. Because the standard (infinite deck) probabilities mean that only about 15% of the time will you draw one of those safe cards, taking another card is highly risky. Standing with 40 puts you very close to the threshold, forcing your opponent to try hard to get near 42. Given this risk versus reward calculation, the best move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on my analysis: Your current total is 18 and the threshold for this round is 34. Since you are far from the threshold and every card drawn (with face values 1 to 13) will keep your total safely below 34 when added to 18 (even if you draw the highest‐value card, 13, your total would be 31), you have plenty of “room” to improve your hand without busting. In addition, looking at previous rounds the dealer’s final sums tended to be in the 20–30 range. By drawing another card you increase your chance of getting closer to 34 (and thereby beating your opponent’s accumulated total) without incurring a bust risk on this turn. \n\nThus, the best move at this turn is to choose to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Let's analyze the situation for Round 5. Your current cards are 6, Q, and J, which total 29. The threshold (N) is 34. If you choose to hit, you risk busting because you can only safely add 5 points or less. In a well‐mixed infinite deck (with 13 equally likely card types where Ace = 1, numbers are their face value, and face cards are 11, 12, and 13), only the cards A (1), 2, 3, 4, and 5 will keep you at or under the threshold. In other words, you have a 5\/13 chance (about 38.5%) of drawing a safe card and a 8\/13 chance (about 61.5%) of busting if you take another hit.\n\nMeanwhile, the opponent’s first visible card is an 8, and they have already hit on Turn 1. Although they will take hits according to their fixed strategy, their available information (with many unknown cards in hand) encourages them to take risks too. Given the high chance of busting for you if you hit, standing at 29 gives you a guaranteed total that does not risk an immediate loss from busting.\n\nThus, considering the risk\/reward tradeoff, the optimal move here is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given the rules and the current round details, your current total is 19 and the threshold is 26. If you stand now, you would be quite far from the threshold, and it’s very likely that your opponent – despite having an unknown hole card – will try to improve his hand aggressively. On the other hand, taking an additional card (“hit”) gives you a chance to get closer to 26. Since the deck is infinite and each card type is equally likely, there are 7 “safe” cards (Ace counted as 1 plus cards 2 through 7) that, if drawn, will bring your total to between 20 and exactly 26, which improves your chances. Although there is around a 46% chance of drawing a card that would push your total over 26 (if you get an 8 or higher), the risk seems justified given that a standing total of 19 is weak against an opponent who will likely boost his hand to a higher total. Based on the history and the risk analysis, the best move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, your total in round 6 is 21 with a threshold of 26. If you hit, you have to add a card that is 5 or lower (Ace counted as 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5) to remain safe; the chance of drawing one of these is 5 out of 13 (about 38.5%), while drawing a card with value 6 or higher (8 out of 13 chance, or roughly 61.5%) would cause you to exceed 26 and bust. Meanwhile, the opponent’s open card is a 3, and based on previous rounds the opponent’s strategy seems to be cautious even though it isn’t fully revealed to us. Standing with 21 avoids the high risk of busting and leaves the opponent to try to approach 26 by drawing additional cards. Compared with the risk of busting (over 60% chance) on a hit, standing with a reasonably strong 21 is the safer option. \n\nSo in this round, the best move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current round:\n• The threshold is 40, meaning both you and the opponent need to get as close as possible to 40 without going over.\n• You currently have a total of 13 (J = 11 and 2 = 2), which is far below 40.\n• In all previous rounds you have seen that both sides usually take several hits to build up a competitive total.\n• The opponent shows a K (worth 13) as his face‐up card, but his hidden card is unknown. Although this might give a hint about his final total, you have much room to improve your own score.\n• Given that standing with 13 is very unlikely to beat an opponent who will likely continue taking hits toward a much higher total (but under 40), the best strategy here is to hit to try to get much closer to 40.\n\nThus, the optimal move for you is to request another card (“Hit”).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that our total is 22 and we cannot bust by drawing any card (because even a K would bring us to 35, which is still below the threshold of 40), it makes sense to improve our total. In previous rounds our winning scores were achieved by coming relatively close to the threshold without busting, and we also notice that the opponent’s visible card is a K (worth 13) while the remaining cards are unknown. Although we don’t know exactly how many points the opponent will accumulate on their hidden draws, our past records suggest that a higher total usually beats the opponent when both are under the threshold.\n\nSince every card from the deck (values 1 to 13) is safe now—none will push us over 40 on this hit—we should use our current turn to improve our position. Therefore, the best decision is to hit rather than stand.\n\nAnswer: Hit","We are at a total of 26 while the threshold is 40. Since even drawing the maximum card value (K is 13) would give 26 + 13 = 39 (which is still under 40), there is no risk of busting on an additional hit. In light of this, to get closer to 40 against an opponent showing a K, it is optimal to take another card. Therefore, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, you already have a total of 36 with a threshold of 40. If you hit, you risk drawing a safe card only if it’s 1–4 (since 36 + 4 = 40); any card of 5 or higher makes you exceed 40 and lose immediately. With an infinite deck where each card value (Ace = 1, 2–10, J = 11, Q = 12, K = 13) is equally likely, the chance of getting a safe card is 4⁄13 (about 31%), while there’s a 9⁄13 (about 69%) risk of busting.\n\nConsidering your opponent’s past performance—where his totals tend to be noticeably lower than the threshold—and the fact that a bust means an immediate loss, it’s far too risky to try to improve your hand when you are already close to 40. Standing at 36 gives you a reasonable chance to win if the opponent doesn’t manage to get close to 40 without busting.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current situation, you have a total of 18, which is quite far from the threshold of 46. In past rounds the opponent’s final totals have remained safely below the threshold but varied widely, and with your total at 18 you are at a significant disadvantage. Since the risk of busting immediately is minimal with your current score (even a 13‐point card would bring you to 31, still safely under 46), the optimal strategy is to take an additional card (Hit) in order to get closer to 46, and thereby improve your chance of winning the round.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round:\n• Your total is 26 and the threshold is 46, leaving you plenty of room (a gap of 20) without risking an immediate bust, since the highest card value is 13.\n• Since being closer to 46 is key to winning, and given that all available cards will add a safe amount to your score (even the highest‐valued card would only bring you to 39), it’s optimal to take another card.\nThus, you should choose to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is 32 and the threshold N is 46. Since the maximum card value is 13 (K = 13), a hit cannot cause you to bust on this turn because even if you draw a King, your total becomes 32 + 13 = 45, which is still within the limit. With an average card value of 7, a hit tends to move your total closer to 46 without risk. In addition, looking at the past rounds the opponent’s strategy has generally led them to totals in a lower range even though sometimes they took several hits. With your current 32, standing would leave you at a significant disadvantage if the opponent improves their hand in the subsequent turn. \n\nTherefore, under these conditions the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, you already have a total of 44 points with a threshold of 46. That means you are only 2 points away from the threshold. Hitting now is very risky because only an Ace (worth 1 point) or a 2 would keep you in the game—any card of value 3 or more would push you over 46 and cause you to bust. In an infinite deck with 13 card values, only 2 out of 13 possibilities (approximately 15%) are safe, while the remaining 11 would bust you.\n\nLooking at the history of previous rounds, your opponent’s play tends not to produce a high total relative to the threshold, and now that you are very close to 46, standing gives you a strong chance that you’ll be closer to the threshold than your opponent. Playing it safe by standing minimizes the chance of busting while still keeping you in contention to win the round.\n\nSo, the best decision is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Considering that the threshold is 33 and your current total is only 14, there is plenty of room to take additional cards without risking an immediate bust. Moreover, in previous rounds it appears that playing more aggressively when far below the threshold has led to winning points. In the current round, with only 14 points and no moves made yet, you are quite behind the threshold, and the risk of drawing any card (even the highest value, 13, which would bring you to 27) is very low. Therefore, in order to build a competitive total that can challenge your opponent's final value, the best strategy is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current total of 19 versus a threshold of 33, there is no risk of “busting” on our next card because even the highest‐valued card (K = 13) would only bring us to 32. In contrast, our opponent has only shown a 2 (with a hidden card coming) and we have seen that in earlier rounds the opponent’s total often ended quite a bit lower (or sometimes, due to over‐hitting, considerably higher—but with a strategy that is fixed and predictable). With our hand at 19 it is clearly beneficial to take another card in order to approach 33 as closely as possible, which maximizes our chance to win the round.\n\nTherefore, the best move for us at this stage is to choose “Hit.”\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, your total is 28 and the threshold (N) is 33. That means if you hit, any card with a value of 6 or higher would immediately cause you to exceed 33 (since 28 + 6 = 34), while only cards 1 (Ace), 2, 3, 4, or 5 are “safe” draws. In an infinite deck the probability for a safe card is 5⁄13 (roughly 38.5%), while there’s about a 61.5% chance of busting if you take another card.\n\nEven though a “safe” hit might get you up closer (or even exactly at) 33, the relatively high bust risk makes it a very aggressive play. In contrast, if you stand with 28 your opponent (who already has one visible card—a 2—and two unknown cards) must try to reach near the threshold. Given the opponent’s fixed strategy in the past rounds, there’s reason to think he might be taking similar risks and could bust or end with a low total, especially when the threshold is as low as 33.\n\nConsidering the balance between the small potential gain (only an average improvement of about 2 points on a hit that doesn’t bust) versus the more than 60% risk to lose immediately, the better move in this situation is to stand with your current total.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given that your current total is only 24 (from two Q’s worth 12 each) and the threshold is 38, you have plenty of “room” to safely take at least one hit. Any card drawn will add between 1 and 13 points, and even the highest‐value card (a King, worth 13 points) would bring your sum to 37—still under 38. In contrast, standing with 24 would leave you far from the threshold and allow the dealer, whose face‐up card is only a 5 but whose hidden card could be better, an opportunity to build a much closer total to 38. Observing the previous rounds, you’ve seen that the dealer tends to take several hits to come closer to the threshold. In this situation, it is clearly in your favor to hit now. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your hand totaling 34 and the threshold of 38, if you hit you only have a safe outcome (without busting) if you draw an Ace, 2, 3, or 4 – a roughly 31% chance. The remaining cards would push your total over 38 and cause you to bust immediately. With a 69% chance of busting by hitting, the risk is very high. Meanwhile, standing with 34 gives you a relatively strong total when compared with the opponent’s visible card of 5 and the likely low totals they may have (as seen in previous rounds). Thus, to maximize your chances of winning (or at least not busting), the best move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

There’s little risk of busting immediately (even drawing a 13 would give you only 25, still far below 37). In order to get closer to 37 and maximize your winning potential against the opponent’s hidden card, the optimal move is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the available information, your current total is 14, which is significantly below the threshold of 37. Given that you've just taken a Hit in Turn 1 and the opponent did the same, sticking with Stand now would not be competitive unless you are planning a very conservative play. Since you are far from reaching the threshold and only risking a small chance of busting relative to the available points needed before reaching 37, it is strategically sound to take another Hit. \n\nTherefore, the advised move in Turn 2 is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is 26 and the threshold is 37. You still have an 11‐point margin before busting. In an infinite deck where Ace through J are safe (adding between 1 and 11 points) and only Q or K would bust (adding 12 or 13 points), you have about an 85% chance to draw a safe card. Standing on 26 would give you a much lower chance to win because the opponent already has three cards that may form a higher total and has been hitting as well. Since improving your hand closer to the threshold is critical and the risk is relatively low, the optimal move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, here’s the analysis:\n\n• Your total is 34 and you have reached turn 4 after previously hitting three times. The threshold is 37.\n• If you choose to hit, the only cards that keep you safe are those with values 1, 2, or 3 (to reach totals of 35, 36 or 37). All other values (from 4 up to 13) cause you to exceed 37.\n• There are 13 equally likely card outcomes, so only 3 chances out of 13 (about 23%) allow you to improve without busting. The risk of busting is roughly 77% on a hit.\n• In contrast, standing at 34 gives you a chance to win against your opponent especially if his total is lower or if he busts later. Since the opponent follows a fixed strategy and his records (three hits already) suggest he is also taking risks, it might turn out that his total could easily exceed yours.\n• Given the high bust probability if you hit, the mathematically better play at this point is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on our current situation, we hold a total of 24 (J = 11, K = 13) with a threshold of 30. If we hit, the additional card’s value, taken from an infinite deck that includes Ace (1), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J (11), Q (12), and K (13), can safely be added only if its value is at most 6 (so that 24 + card ≤ 30). There are 6 such “safe” card values (Ace through 6) out of 13 possible types, giving roughly a 6\/13 (about 46%) chance to avoid busting and get a new total between 25 and 30. Conversely, there is a 7\/13 (about 54%) chance to draw a card with value 7 or more and exceed 30, which would immediately result in a bust (unless the opponent also busts—but then it’s a draw; however, that risk is not worth taking given our moderate total).\n\nFurthermore, note that in Round 1 the opponent followed a fixed strategy which led them to hit repeatedly and eventually bust in a more lenient threshold (N = 37). In this round, with a stricter limit at 30 and our relatively high total of 24, it is a strong position. Standing now leaves our sum in a good spot, forcing the opponent, whose first visible card is just a 2 (a weak start), to take more risks trying to reach a competitive total. Given that hitting carries a higher than 50% chance of busting and standing preserves our advantage, the sensible play here is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","I’ve reviewed the situation and the game’s rules. With a threshold N = 30, your current total is 24 (J = 11, K = 13). In this round the opponent already started with a “2” plus two more cards drawn at random. Although you already “stood” on turn 1, you have an opportunity on turn 2 to change your decision because the opponent has not yet stopped.\n\nAt N = 30 you want to be as close as possible to 30 without busting. Sticking with 24 is risky because the opponent will likely have two mystery cards that bring them nearer 30. (Remember the opponent’s fixed strategy led them in round 1 to take several hits even if they eventually bust.) \n\nIf you take a hit, you improve your total only if you draw a card valued ≤6 (Ace (1) through 6); otherwise your total exceeds 30 and you bust immediately. Given that the infinite deck makes all card values equally likely (each of the 13 ranks with probability 1⁄13), the chance of drawing a safe card is 6⁄13 (≈46%) while there’s a 7⁄13 (≈54%) chance of busting. Although over half the chance results in an immediate bust, the 46% chance is your only hope to obtain a total between 25 and 30 (with a 7.7% chance each for 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, or ideally 30) that could beat or at least tie the opponent.\n\nLooking at the opponent’s situation—in which they already hit once and have uncertain cards—standing with a total of 24 is almost certainly too weak for a win. Thus, after weighing the benefit of possibly reaching a more competitive total against the bust risk, the best move is to take the risk and Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your current total is 16 (from cards “3” and “K”) and the threshold is 43, you’re very far from getting close to that target. With the values given, even drawing the highest-value card (a K worth 13) would bring you only to 16 + 13 = 29—well within the safe zone. Therefore, you have plenty of room to risk drawing another card. Additionally, with the dealer’s showing card being “6” and knowing that the opponent follows a fixed strategy (which in previous rounds involved hitting for a while), you’ll want to improve your total so that you can have a better chance of getting closer to 43 than your opponent. In summary, based on the rules, the current board state, and your score of 16, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given your current total of 22 (from cards 3, K, and 6) and a threshold of 43, the worst-case additional card (the King worth 13) would bring you to 35 – still safely under 43. You have plenty of room to take at least one more card. Meanwhile, your opponent (whose strategy so far has been to keep hitting even at the risk of busting) is already committed to drawing. To maximize your chance of ending closer to 43 without busting, it is optimal to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current total of 29 with a threshold of 43—and knowing that every card is drawn from an infinite deck where even the highest card (K, counting as 13) will still leave us at 42 (which is under 43)—it’s beneficial to request another card. Hitting now will only bring us closer to the threshold without any risk of an immediate bust, and we want to be as competitive as possible against our opponent’s fixed strategy.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given your current total is 42 with a threshold of 43, if you hit you run an almost 92% risk of busting since any card except an Ace (worth 1) will push you over 43. Although drawing an Ace (which has roughly a 1\/13 chance assuming an even distribution) would bring your total to exactly 43 and keep you safe, that probability is very low. Meanwhile, standing with 42 gives you a strong hand that’s only 1 point below the threshold. Facing an opponent whose strategy is fixed and considering your current nearly optimal total, it’s best to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on your current total of 42 with a threshold of 43, any hit would risk getting a card greater than 1 and busting (since only an Ace, valued at 1, is safe). With the likelihood of drawing an Ace at about 1 in 13, it is far safer to Stand with your current hand of 42, which is only 1 point shy of the threshold. Therefore, the optimal move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","We have a current total of 42 with a threshold of 43, so if you hit you risk busting almost certainly (only an Ace, i.e. 1 point, would keep you safe, and that happens with about a 1\/13 chance). Since your total (42) is already very close to the limit and your opponent’s strategy suggests they keep hitting even when close to the threshold, it’s much better to stand and avoid the overwhelming risk of busting. \n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation, you already have 42 points (with a threshold of 43), so any hit card except an Ace (which is worth only 1) would immediately put you over the limit. Since the probability of drawing an Ace from an infinite deck of 13 equally possible cards is only 1\/13 (about 7.7%), it is very risky to hit. In contrast, if you stand at 42, you are extremely unlikely to lose because your opponent, even following his fixed strategy and having already taken several hits, must risk busting or ending up with a lower total to beat your score.\n\nTherefore, the optimal decision in this round is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current round:\n• The threshold is 30.\n• Your cards are a 3 and a Q (worth 3 and 12 points, respectively), for a total of 15.\n• The opponent’s revealed card is a 6, and their hidden card is unknown.\n• Because all cards come from an infinite deck and the highest card has a value of 13, even if you draw the highest card now (15 + 13 = 28) you won’t bust (since 28 ≤ 30).\n\nSince you have plenty of “room” to hit now without the risk of busting immediately, and since being closer to 30 generally improves your chances in a contest where the opponent’s fixed strategy appears to involve repeatedly drawing to approach (or even exceed) the threshold, the optimal move in this situation is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the rules and previous rounds, here’s the reasoning for Round 4:\n\n• The threshold (N) is 30. Your current cards are ['3', 'Q', '6'] for a total of 21. This is considerably lower than the threshold, leaving you room to improve while still being safe.\n• When you hit from 21, any card whose value is 9 or below (Ace through 9) will yield a safe total (since 21 + 9 = 30); however, drawing a 10, J, Q, or K will immediately put you over 30 (since they are valued 10\/11\/12\/13 respectively). With 13 card types assumed equally likely, there is roughly a 9\/13 chance (about 69%) to get a safe card and a 4\/13 chance (about 31%) to bust. \n• Observing previous rounds, the opponent’s fixed strategy has led them to hit repeatedly—even if that causes them to exceed the threshold. In Round 2 the dealer, despite hitting, ended up busting (32) while you, with a higher total in that round (24), won. In other rounds the opponent often overshot the threshold.\n• With your total at just 21, the risk (around 30% bust chance) is acceptable given that a safe card will likely put you closer to the threshold (resulting in totals between 22 and 30) and make it harder for the opponent to beat you without risking a bust themselves.\n• In sum, the expected improvement in your position (raising your total from 21 nearer to 30) outweighs the bust risk, so your best move is to “hit.”\n\nAnswer: Hit","Your hand totals 34, which is already above the threshold N = 30. According to the rules, if you exceed N you’re considered bust. Whether you hit or stand, your final total will remain over the threshold. If the opponent stays under N, they win; if they also exceed N, the round is declared a draw. Since hitting further only increases your total without any benefit (because the distance above N doesn’t matter in a bust–bust matchup, it is automatically a draw), the optimal move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the information, your total is 16 and the round’s threshold is 34. Since every card value is at most 13, if you take one card you cannot bust immediately (16 + 13 = 29, which is still under 34). Compared with your opponent’s showing card of 10—and considering the historical rounds where the dealer (opponent) consistently ended up “hitting” several times (often overshooting the threshold)—the evidence suggests that their fixed strategy tends to lead to busts.\n\nWith a low total of 16, you want to improve your hand to be as close to 34 as possible without busting so that when the dealer completes his moves, you have a higher chance of being closer to the threshold or avoiding a bust when the opponent busts. Therefore, the proper move in this situation is to take an extra card (“Hit”) and work to build a total closer to 34.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the current state we have a total of 26 while the threshold is 34. By hitting we stand a roughly 61.5% chance (drawing Ace through 8 since there are 8 safe card types out of 13 possible types) of improving our total without busting. Since 26 is rather low relative to the threshold and considering that the opponent’s fixed strategy appears to involve repeated hits (as seen in all previous rounds), standing now would likely leave us too far behind if the opponent manages to get closer to 34 (or at least not bust). Thus, the optimal decision is to take another card ­– in short, Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation the current round has a threshold of 24 and your total is only 13. Since you can hit safely with any additional card that is 11 or less—and because in the infinite deck each card is equally likely (with only Q and K causing you to immediately bust when added to 13)—the chance to get a “safe” card is high (11\/13). With only a roughly 15% risk of busting on your next hit and the need to come closer to 24 to beat an opponent who is likely to improve from his 2 plus an unknown card, it is statistically favorable to request another card.\n\nThus, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round setup the best option is to hit. You currently have a total of 14 (from cards 8, 5, A) while the threshold is 24. With a remaining margin of 10 points, you have about a 10\/13 chance to draw a card that doesn’t push you over the limit (since drawing any card valued 1–10 is safe, while drawing one of J, Q, or K — valued 11, 12, or 13 — will bust you). In contrast, standing on 14 puts you at a significant disadvantage because the opponent already has a face‐up card of “2” and could improve aggressively with their fixed “hit” strategy. Therefore, increasing your total by hitting so you can get closer to 24 is the more favorable move given these probabilities and the need to beat or keep up with the opponent.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Let's analyze the situation.\n\nYour current hand is ['8', '5', 'A', '9'] with a total of 23. The threshold is 24, so if you hit you can safely only draw an Ace (worth 1) to reach exactly 24. Any other card (2 through K) will push you over and cause a bust.\n\nSince only 1 out of the 13 equally likely card values (Ace = 1 point) is safe (≈7.7% chance), hitting carries a very high risk of busting. Meanwhile, if you stand at 23, you’re very likely to be very close to the threshold, potentially beating the opponent (whose unknown cards will reveal their total later).\n\nThus, the optimal move in this situation is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on your current hand (Q and K for a total of 25) and with the round threshold at 34, you have quite a bit of room to try to reach a higher total. If you hit, you have a 9⁄13 (about 69%) chance of drawing a card whose value (1 through 9) won’t cause you to bust. In that case, you could improve your total to a number between 26 and 34, which is clearly better than standing on 25. On the other hand, there’s roughly a 31% chance (drawing a 10 or a face card) that you’ll bust immediately. Considering that with a total of 25 you are undercompetitive against the likely totals the opponent will eventually reach when aiming for 34, the risk is acceptable. Therefore, the optimal move in this situation is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your total is 28 and the threshold is 34, you are 6 points away from the limit. Since if you hit you must avoid drawing a card with a value of 7 or more (because 28+7 = 35 > 34), only cards A (value 1) through 6 will keep you safe. There are 6 “safe” outcomes out of the 13 possible cards in an infinite deck, meaning roughly a 46% chance of drawing a safe card and a 54% chance to “bust” immediately. On the other hand, if you stand with 28, you risk leaving too large a margin for your opponent to beat, as his high face‐up card (\"J\") suggests he might obtain a reasonably high score with his draws. In previous rounds the opponent’s actions have shown that his strategy tends to push toward as high a total as possible, and given that you have access to the complete history, you can infer that aiming for a stronger total is necessary in this situation.\n\nConsidering these factors, the chance of winning or at least drawing improves by hitting – aiming to get closer to the threshold (for example, reaching totals in the low 30s, ideally 32–34) which is more competitive against an opponent who is likely to improve his score on his turn. Thus, despite the risk of busting, the best play in this situation is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the game rules, you may only hit until your total does not exceed the threshold N. Since N is 34 and your visible cards already add up to 41, you have exceeded the threshold. Even if you took another card it would not change that fact. Therefore, the correct action is not to take another card but to stand and let the settlement occur.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current situation, you only have a total of 13 out of a maximum allowed 39, while the opponent’s face‐up card is 8 (and his face-down card is unknown). With such low totals and plenty of room before reaching the threshold, there isn’t immediate danger of busting on the next hit. The opponent’s behavior so far suggests he keeps hitting fairly aggressively until close to the threshold. In order to improve your chance of beating his total without risking going over, you should try to build a higher total gradually. Therefore, the recommended move in this situation is to take another card—Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your total is only 22 while the threshold is 39 – and because even the highest card (K = 13) would bring you to only 35 (which is safely below 39) – it is very safe to hit at this point. In addition, knowing that your opponent’s fixed strategy tends to have them taking extra cards even when running close to the threshold (or even sometimes busting), maximizing your own total toward 39 increases your chance of winning or at least forcing a more favorable close‐call. Therefore, based on the current board and considering that you have ample “room” to draw another card without the risk of busting immediately, your move should be to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on what we know, our current hand shows a total of 34 with N = 39. Standing – that is, stopping now – would leave us 5 points away from the threshold. Our opponent already shows an 8 and has committed to at least two hits; his eventual total is uncertain but using his fixed strategy he is likely to keep trying for a higher sum. In almost every past round when the threshold was lower our opponent hit until his score edged very close to N (or went over), and our win records show that improving our total (when safe to do so) helped us win (or at least draw) when we were closer to N. \n\nIf we “hit” with a total of 34, only cards with value 5 or less (namely Ace, 2, 3, 4, or 5) will keep us safely under or exactly at the threshold. (Any card of 6 or higher makes us exceed 39.) In an infinite deck with 13 possible values, that means a safe draw happens with probability 5\/13 (about 38.5%) while drawing any card 6 or more (8\/13 chance, about 61.5%) would put us at risk of busting. However, staying at 34 in a round with a threshold of 39 usually means the opponent can more comfortably make a play that puts him closer to N. \n\nGiven that our opponent’s strategy is fixed and he has already shown a tendency to “hit” early on in these rounds, we can expect him to try to improve his hand—and if he doesn’t bust, having a total closer to 39 would beat our 34. Therefore, seeking an improved total by taking one more card is the better choice in this situation.\n\nThus, the recommended move is to \"Hit.\"\n\nAnswer: Hit","Your current total is exactly 39, which is the threshold. Because hitting risks exceeding the allowed number, the optimal decision is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on our current situation in Round 9 – our hand is [3, Q] with a total of 15 and the threshold is 46 – it is clear that there is plenty of room to build a higher total before risking a bust (exceeding 46). In every hit we take, even with the highest possible card value (13), our total will only become 28, which is still very far from 46. Given that our opponent’s fixed strategy appears to involve hitting until reaching totals that often exceed the threshold (or at least risk overshooting it), we have significant freedom to improve our hand without worry of immediate busting.\n\nThus, it is the right decision to ask for an extra card (Hit) at this stage.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that the threshold in this round is 46 and your current total is 22, you have a lot of “room” to improve your score without immediately risking a bust. In the previous rounds opponents often took several hits and ended up with sums near or even beyond the threshold. With only 22 on the board and knowing the opponent’s fixed behavior, it’s in your best interest to try reaching a higher total closer to 46 before you stand. Therefore, in turn 2 your optimal decision is to ask for another card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\nYour current total is 31 with a threshold of 46, leaving you a margin of 15 points. No matter what card you draw (the maximum value being 13 for a King), adding it to 31 will keep you under 46. Getting closer to 46 increases your chances to beat the opponent when the settlement occurs, especially since the opponent’s visible card is a King (worth 13) and they will likely try to improve their total with subsequent hits. With one safe hit available and plenty of room for improvement, the logical move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the analysis of your current total (36) relative to the round’s threshold (46) and the observation that drawing a card carries roughly a 23% risk of busting (drawing an 11, 12, or 13) while 77% of the time you’ll safely improve your total, it’s in your interest to try to get closer to 46. In addition, given that your opponent’s only visible card is a “K” (worth 13) and his unknown cards have an average value of 7, his expected total is around 41 if he stops hitting now. Sticking at 36 is likely too low compared to his likely total. Therefore, taking another card (hit) is a better strategy in this situation.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current board, your total is 38 while the maximum allowed (N) is 46. This means you have an 8‐point “safety cushion” (46 – 38 = 8). When you hit, you will draw one card from an infinite deck where (assuming equal likelihood for all 13 card types) there’s an 8 in 13 chance that the added value is 8 or below—keeping you safe—and a 5 in 13 chance that the card is 9 or higher, which would push your total over 46 and result in an immediate bust.\n\nBecause your current 38 is a bit low relative to 46, and given the opponent’s fixed strategy as seen in previous rounds (where the dealer often takes several hits and, with a high up‐card like K showing, tends either to approach 46 or even bust), it is advantageous to try to get closer to the limit. A safe card (anything from A=1 through 8) would bring your total into the 39–46 range. In later turns you can reassess your position further.\n\nThus, despite the roughly 38.5% risk of busting on this next card, the chance to boost your total closer to 46 for a better showdown makes an additional hit the preferred choice.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is 14, which is very low compared to the threshold of 44. Since the opponent’s face-up card is a 10 and you have plenty of room to improve your total without the immediate risk of busting, it’s strategically beneficial to take another card (Hit). This will allow you to get closer to 44 before you decide to stand, improving your chance of beating your opponent given the opponent’s fixed strategy.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the game state, you only have 22 points (from your 4, 10, and 8) while the threshold N is 44. With so much room before busting (you could add up to 22 points exactly) and knowing that the opponent’s face‐up card is a 10 with two unknown cards in hand (and given that the opponent’s fixed strategy tends to take extra cards), standing now would leave you at a large disadvantage. To maximize your chance of closing the gap toward 44 without busting—and thus outdistance your opponent—it is best at this stage to take another card (i.e. “Hit”). \n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, you currently have a total of 35 and can safely add at most 9 points without “exceeding” the threshold of 44. Since a hit gives you a 9-in-13 (about 69% chance) to draw a card from 1 to 9 – which would boost your total closer to 44 – and only a 4-in-13 chance to bust by drawing a 10 or a face card, the risk–reward balance favors trying to improve your hand. Moreover, looking at the past rounds the opponent tends to keep drawing even at the risk of going over the limit, which frequently leads them to bust or end up with totals that are very volatile. By taking a hit now you not only increase your chance of closing the gap to the target but also put extra pressure on an opponent whose fixed (and risk‐prone) strategy may take them over the line. All in all, the analysis suggests that the best play in the current round is to request another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current total of 36 (with threshold 44) and knowing that we’re still quite a ways from 44, we need to get closer to the limit. Waiting with 36 seems too far off and likely leaves room for the opponent (who has already taken three hits) to either improve or push their luck. Although hitting comes with a bust risk (drawing a card with value 9 or more will exceed 44)—about a 5 in 13 chance—the odds of drawing a safe card (1–8) are roughly 8 in 13. The likely average improvement (adding about 4.5 on average) would bring our total nearer to a competitive total (around 40–41) and give us a better chance to beat the opponent given their fixed, aggressive strategy in previous rounds.\n\nThus, to increase our chances of winning this round, the best move is to ask for an additional card: Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your cards add up to 42 while the threshold is 44. If you choose to take another card (“hit”), there is only a 2\/13 chance (an Ace or a 2) of drawing a card that keeps you from busting. In contrast, there is about an 11\/13 chance that an extra draw will put you over 44. Although getting to 43 or 44 would make your hand closer to the threshold, the risk of busting far outweighs the potential benefit. On the other hand, if you “stand” with 42, you avoid the immediate risk of busting and rely on the fact that your opponent – who has been aggressively hitting in every round – is very likely to bust or finish with a lower safe total.\n\nGiven the risk–reward tradeoff, the best move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Since our opponent’s visible card is a Q (worth 12 points) and his hidden card is unknown, we have limited information about his total. Given that both sides aim to be as close to 43 as possible without going over, it's clear we need to improve our hand and approach the threshold safely. With a total of 5 and such a wide margin before risking a bust (up to 43), it is strategically sound to request an additional card in order to get closer to a competitive total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation your total is only 12 while the threshold is 43. Even considering the worst-case card value (13), adding that would only bring your total to 25, which is safe. With such a low total and plenty of room to improve without the risk of busting, it is beneficial to take another card (Hit) in order to get closer to 43 and improve your chance of winning against the opponent.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Considering the current situation: your total is 20, which is far from the threshold of 43. Since you still have plenty of room before risking a bust (even a maximum-draw card of 13 would bring you only to 33), it makes sense to improve your hand further. In contrast, if you were to stand with 20 the opponent – who already has a high starting card (Q valued at 12) and has hit twice – might easily reach a total closer to 43. Therefore, the optimal decision is to take another card (Hit) in order to build a hand closer to 43 without exceeding it.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the available information, your current total is 21 which is significantly lower than the threshold of 43. With plenty of room before risk of busting (since even drawing the highest value card, K = 13, only brings you to 34), it’s advantageous to hit in order to get closer to 43. The opponent already has five cards (including a Q showing) and has been hitting each turn. Given that the opponent’s fixed strategy will likely keep them trying to improve their total, you want to boost your own score to have a better chance when both sides eventually stand. Therefore, taking another card (i.e. Hit) is the optimal move at this moment.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round, your total is 26 while the threshold is 43. Since you’re far from 43 and the opponent has already stood with five cards, you want to try to get closer to 43 without risking going over. In this situation, taking another card (Hit) is the best option because it gives you a chance to raise your total closer to 43. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is 31 and you still have room to get closer to the threshold of 43 without exceeding it. When you hit, only drawing a King (value 13) will cause you to bust, which has a probability of 1⁄13 since there are 13 card types (each equally likely in an infinite deck). With a 12⁄13 chance you will safely improve your total (e.g. drawing a Q will bring you exactly to 43, and drawing other safe cards will yield totals between 32 and 42), hitting gives you a much better chance of ending with a score closer to 43 than your opponent. Considering that the opponent already completed their moves, you want to maximize your chance to win. Thus, the best decision is to request another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the information provided, our total is 37 and the limit (N) is 43. We can hit until our total gets as close to 43 as possible, but if we add more than 6 we bust. There are 13 equally‐likely card types (Ace = 1, 2–10 as numbers, and face cards valued 11, 12, 13). That means that if we draw a card we have a 6 in 13 chance (only cards with value 1–6) of staying in and a 7 in 13 chance of busting. Although that is a risk (roughly 46% safety versus 54% bust chance), our current total of 37 is relatively low compared to what we expect from the opponent—in light of the opponent’s visible Q (12) plus the three hits they took (and they have already decided to stand on later turns). Their set of cards likely gives them an expected total around 40 (using an average card value of 7). \n\nThus, if we stand now at 37 our chances are not good—our total is likely lower than theirs. By taking another card we have a chance (if we draw a 4, 5, or 6) to reach totals of 41, 42, or even 43 (the ideal) which would put us in a much better spot compared to our opponent. Although hitting carries a bust risk of more than 50%, the potential benefit of improving our total in this situation outweighs the risk of staying at 37 and likely losing against an opponent whose unknown cards may well bring their total above ours.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your current total is 42 and the threshold is 43, if you choose to hit you face a 12\/13 chance of drawing a card that exceeds the threshold (since only an Ace, valued at 1, would bring your total to exactly 43), whereas your opponent has already stopped drawing additional cards with an unknown (but likely safe) total. With only about a 7.7% chance of improving your total without busting, the risk of busting is far too high. Thus, the optimal move in this situation is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation, your total is 14 and the threshold is 31. With maximum card value being 13, there’s no risk of busting on your next draw. Also, standing at 14 would be far from the threshold. Given that the opponent’s face‐up card is “10” (worth 10 points) and you have plenty of room to improve without busting, the optimal move here is to request another card. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the information, your current total is 21 while the threshold is 31. You need at least 10 more points to hit 31 exactly. If you stand now, you’re left with a score that is likely too low compared to what an opponent—who is following a fixed hit\/stand strategy—might eventually obtain (they already have a 10 showing and have taken one hit on turn 1). \n\nSince every card is equally likely (there are 13 possibilities with an infinite deck) and the values are defined so that safe cards (1–10) won’t bust you (because 21 + any of these is at most 31) while drawing one of J, Q, K (values 11, 12, 13) will immediately bust you, the risk of busting is 3\/13 (roughly 23%). In contrast, about 10\/13 of the time you will get a card that improves your total (bringing you closer to 31 or even hitting 31 exactly if you get a 10). \n\nGiven that your total of 21 is relatively far from the threshold of 31 while the opponent is likely to try and get as close to 31 as possible (and might even take a risky additional hit since they do not see all your cards), the chance to improve your hand outweighs the risk of busting. Thus, the optimal move is to request another card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the calculations, your current total is 23 while the round’s limit is 31. Using the known card–values and the opponent’s apparent fixed play (who already hit on turn 1 and stood on turn 2), we can roughly assess the risk of drawing an extra card. If you choose to hit, you have a roughly 61.5% chance of drawing a “safe” card (one that is 8 points or below) and a 38.5% chance of busting immediately. After a safe hit your total would be between 24 and 31, but then it would be compared to the opponent’s final total (which, based on their one visible card “10” and two unknowns drawn from an infinite deck, has its own probability distribution). A calculation comparing the expected score if you were to stand at 23 versus hitting (and then following an optimal strategy afterward) indicates that standing gives an expected payoff of about 0.515 (where winning counts as 1 point and drawing 0.5) while hitting – even when averaging over the safe outcomes – yields around 0.495 on average. \n\nTherefore, the best move given this analysis is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current situation—the threshold is 28 and your hand totals only 9—it is far from reaching the limit. Since any card drawn will have a value no greater than 13 (and 9 + 13 = 22, which is still safely under 28), you are in an excellent position to improve your total without risking an immediate bust. Moreover, by analyzing the opponent’s fixed strategy from previous rounds, it seems they tend to hit only a few times before standing. As you have plenty of room to enhance your total and get closer to 28, the optimal move is to ask for another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given your current total is 12 and the threshold is 28, you have plenty of room to draw without worrying about busting. Since any single card (even a King worth 13) would only bring you to at most 25, it’s safe to get closer to the target. In addition, your opponent’s strategy (shown by his first turn action this round and previous rounds) suggests he is also drawing to gain a higher total, so staying at 12 would likely leave you behind. Therefore, the best move is to request another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round, you have a total of 16 when the threshold is 28. With an infinite deck where every card has an equal 1\/13 chance, if you hit you risk busting only if you get a 13 (since 16 + 13 = 29, which exceeds 28). This gives you only about a 7.7% chance of busting on the next card while a hit gives you a much improved total in most cases. Compared to standing on 16 (which is very low relative to the threshold 28), hitting is the far more promising option given the low immediate risk and the likelihood of ending closer to 28. \n\nThus, in the current situation your optimal move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the running totals and our observations from earlier rounds, our current total is 21 in a round where the threshold is 28. Although hitting could bring us closer to 28 (with a best‐case outcome of 28 if we draw a 7) and thus beat an opponent who might get a “safer” total, hitting now comes with a roughly 46% chance to bust (since drawing any card 8 or higher would take us over 28). Meanwhile, our opponent (whose fixed strategy in previous rounds led them to “hit aggressively” even when that risked busting) already shows a pattern of taking extra cards and then later standing, and in past rounds that aggressive play has resulted in busts.\n\nAt a threshold as low as 28 (leaving us a margin of only 7 points) the risk of busting when trying to improve a 21 is considerable. Given that our opponent is likely to be forced into at-risk hits as well—especially with a poor face‐up card (a 3 in this round)—playing conservatively and “standing” on 21 should be our safest choice. It avoids the nearly 50% bust risk from an extra card while possibly banking on the opponent’s strategy working against them.\n\nThus, our answer is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current situation the best choice is to hit. With a threshold of 38 and your current total of 16, drawing any card cannot cause you to bust immediately (16 + maximum 13 = 29, which is still below 38). Moreover, you want to improve your score so that you are closer to 38 than your opponent. Given that the opponent shows a Queen (worth 12) and their unknown card is expected to bring their total into the low twenties, you need to build your hand further. Therefore, the recommended move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I analyzed your current total of 28 against the threshold 38 and weighed the chance of busting if you hit. With your total at 28 you have a “safety margin” of 10 points; a drawn card of value 11 (J), 12 (Q) or 13 (K) would bust you. Because there is a 3\/13 chance (about 23%) of drawing one of those high cards—and a 10\/13 chance to improve your total closer to 38—it appears that hitting is a worthwhile risk. In addition, knowing that your opponent’s fixed strategy tends to push for higher totals (as seen in previous rounds), standing at only 28 could be too low to beat the opponent if the latter continues drawing. Thus, you are advised to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your cards add to 33 with a threshold of 38. If you take another card (Hit), you risk drawing a card that is greater than 5 (since 33 + 6 = 39, which exceeds 38); note that with an infinite deck each card value from 1 (Ace) to 13 (K) is equally likely (1\/13 each). That gives you only 5 “safe” cards out of 13 (cards with values 1–5) and an approximate 38% chance of staying in play while risking a roughly 62% chance of immediately busting. Meanwhile, looking at the opponent’s behavior in the three previous rounds, they seem to be following a fixed strategy that often ends up with totals above the threshold (busting). In all previous rounds you won because your total stayed safely under N while your opponent overshot.\n\nGiven that if you stand your 33 should win as long as the opponent’s later moves cause them to bust—and since the opponent’s strategy has consistently led to busting in earlier rounds—it is optimal in this situation to play it safe and choose Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the information:\n• The round’s threshold is 27.\n• Your current total is 14 (J = 11 and 3 = 3).\n• With an infinite deck and card values from 1 (Ace) up to 13 (King), drawing any card will add between 1 and 13.\n• Since 14 + 13 = 27 exactly, you cannot bust with one additional card.\n• Even though the opponent’s face‐up card is a 9, you are far from 27.\n• Thus, by requesting an additional card you have no risk of immediate bust and can get you closer to 27.\nTherefore, the best move in this situation is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given your cards already total 27 (J=11, 3=3, K=13), which exactly equals the threshold, taking another card risks going over N and losing immediately. The optimal move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current situation, your total is only 14 while the threshold is 42. With an infinite deck where the average card is 7, you have plenty of room before risking a bust. Also, since your opponent’s fixed strategy in previous rounds sometimes forces them into taking risks (and sometimes even busting) while you still have a wide margin, it makes sense to try to improve your hand toward a more competitive total. Therefore, the best move in this round is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, you currently have 27 points and the threshold is 42. Because the maximum card value is 13, if you were to hit just once your new total would be at most 27+13 = 40, which is still safely below 42. In contrast, your opponent’s face‐up card is a “J” (worth 11), and while you don’t yet know their hidden cards or how soon they’ll stop, the record shows they hit at least once before standing in similar rounds.\n\nSince you’re well under the threshold and there’s no risk of busting on your next hit (27 + any card ≤ 40), it makes sense to try to improve your total. Getting closer to 42 will make it harder for the opponent to beat your score without taking the risk of busting. (Later on after another hit you might have to be more cautious, but right now an extra card is risk‐free.)\n\nTherefore, the correct move on Turn 2 is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current total of 35 and the fact that the threshold is 42, we are still 7 points short of the maximum. Considering that a safe hit would give us a chance to move closer to 42 (for example, drawing a 7 would take us to the perfect 42, while drawing 1–6 increases our total by a modest amount) and that the opponent’s fixed strategy has resulted in them stopping with lower totals in most past rounds, it makes strategic sense to try to improve our position. Although there is roughly a 46% chance to bust on a hit (since any card 8 or higher will put us over 42) the possibility to get closer to 42 outweighs the risk at this point – especially since our current sum of 35 isn’t competitive enough if the opponent draws further.\n\nTherefore, the recommended move is to take another card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Since your total is only 11 and you’re very far away from the threshold of 32, there’s essentially no risk of busting on your first extra hit. With an almost \"free\" chance to improve your total before approaching 32—and knowing that your opponent, starting with an 8, is likely to hit to boost their total—you should take the chance to add another card. Therefore, according to the situation, the best move for the first turn is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current total of 13 and the threshold being 32, there is a wide margin before reaching bust. Even if a high card (up to 13 points) is drawn, the total would still be within safe limits. Standing with 13 is too low compared to what the opponent might eventually reach. In previous rounds, the opponent’s strategy involved hitting until a higher total was achieved. With our total far below the threshold, we should aim to build a stronger total while we have plenty of room to hit safely. Therefore, the best move in this situation is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our situation, our current total is 25 and the threshold is 32. That leaves us with a margin of 7 points; if we “hit,” we risk busting if the drawn card is greater than 7. From an infinite deck where each card type (Ace, 2, …, 10, J, Q, K) is equally likely, there are 7 “safe” cards (Ace counts as 1, then 2–7) and 6 “risky” cards (8, 9, 10, J, Q, K) so the safe chance is roughly 7\/13 (about 54%). On a successful safe hit we’ll improve our total–on average by about 4 points–to around 29, which is closer to the threshold and offers a better chance against an opponent who (based on his past rounds) seems content to draw extra cards from a low starting total. Standing with 25 would leave us rather far from 32, giving the opponent plenty of room to play while his strategy might force him to take additional hits (with a risk of busting) but also giving him a chance to beat us when he doesn’t. \n\nThus considering the rough odds of safe improvement and the fact that we need to push our total higher to have a competitive edge, the best move in this situation is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current cards, we have J (11) and Q (12) for a total of 23 while the threshold is 37. Since even the worst‐possible card (K, worth 13 points) would bring our total to 36 (23 + 13 = 36, which does not exceed 37), there is no risk of busting on our very first hit. Given that being closer to the threshold gives us a better chance to win against the opponent—and that the opponent’s fixed strategy does not change regardless of how far behind we are—it makes sense to request an extra card. Therefore, the best move in this situation is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, you currently have a total of 27 (J = 11, Q = 12, 4 = 4) with a threshold of 37. If you choose to take another card (Hit), you have a safe range: drawing any card from Ace (1) through 10 adds at most 10, which exactly meets the threshold (27 + 10 = 37). However drawing any face card (J, Q, or K, with values 11, 12, 13) would push you over 37 (for example, 27 + 11 = 38) and cause you to bust. Assuming the cards come uniformly from an infinite deck containing 13 kinds of cards (Ace, 2…10, J, Q, K), 10 out of 13 outcomes are safe, while 3 out of 13 will bust you. With more than a 76% chance (10\/13) to safely improve your score, the risk–reward trade‐off favors hitting. In addition, with your opponent showing a 9 and having already hit once, it is likely they will try to boost their total as well. Sticking with 27 would leave you at a disadvantage. By hitting now, you have an opportunity to get closer to the threshold, and if you get a safe card (say a value between Ace and 9), you could even consider hitting again later if needed.\n\nThus, the best move in this round is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 32 (from J = 11, Q = 12, 4, and 5) with a threshold of 37, we’re 5 points shy of the limit. Although standing at 32 might be safe, the history shows that many rounds were won by having a total closer to N (with our totals in the 33–37 range doing better). In our situation the odds of drawing a safe card (i.e. one with value at most 5 so that 32 + card ≤ 37) are 5 out of 13 (roughly 38.5%). In contrast, drawing a card 6 or higher (8 out of 13 chances) would exceed the threshold immediately. Given the opponent’s strategy (who already hit twice and whose visible card is “9”) and reviewing past rounds where our win came from reaching totals closer to the threshold (even if it meant taking slight risks), it appears that risking one more card is justified in order to get closer to 37.\n\nThus, although hitting carries a risk of busting, the improvement in our total (if we get 1–5) would give us a competitive edge against an opponent who, by his fixed behavior, could be aiming for a higher total. Balancing that risk versus the potential reward and knowing that you need a competitive total to win (or at least force a draw), the move toward making our total more aggressive is recommended.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the analysis of the current round:\n\n• Your current total is 36. The threshold N is 37.\n• If you take another card (Hit), the only safe card is an Ace (worth 1 point) which would bring your total exactly to 37. Any other card (2 up to K) would cause your total to exceed 37 and bust.\n• Since cards are drawn from an infinite deck with 13 equally likely ranks, the chance to draw an Ace is 1\/13 (about 7.7%), whereas the chance to draw any other card is 12\/13 (about 92.3%).\n• As your opponent follows a fixed strategy and you already have a high total of 36, the enormous risk of busting is not worth the small chance of getting the perfect Ace.\n \nTherefore, the best move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current round, you have a total of 9 points (with cards 3 and 6) and the threshold is 27. Since the maximum card value is 13 and 9 + 13 = 22 is still below 27, there’s essentially no risk of busting on your first hit. In addition, your opponent’s visible card is a 2, which is weak, and you know from your history that the opponent’s fixed strategy may force them to hit several times (risking an overrun). Therefore, it is optimal to continue drawing cards to build your total toward 27. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current situation, our hand totals only 14 while the threshold is 27. Since every card in the deck is between 1 and 13 points (with a King being 13, which would exactly hit 27 when added to 14), there’s no chance of immediately busting on the next card. Also, having a low visible opponent card (a 2) suggests the opponent’s starting total isn’t high. In previous rounds when the threshold was low (as in Round 5 with N = 27), reaching a total as high as possible (ideally 27) was a decisive advantage. With only 14 so far, it is clearly beneficial to draw another card (Hit) now rather than stand with a low total. \n\nTherefore, the decision for Turn 2 is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your current total is 26 with a threshold of 27, if you hit you risk busting with nearly any card. Only drawing an Ace (worth 1) would bring you to exactly 27, and that event has about a 1\/13 chance as the deck is infinite with uniform probability. Standing guarantees you 26, avoiding almost certain busting. In this situation, aiming for 26 is much safer because the risk of busting when hitting far outweighs the slight chance to reach 27. Therefore, the best move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on our analysis we’re far from the threshold (only 24 vs. 46) and have plenty of \"room\" to improve our total without the risk of busting immediately. In previous rounds we saw that a moderate to aggressive hit‐strategy worked well when there was significant headroom between our total and N. Meanwhile, the opponent’s fixed strategy and slight visible weakness (showing only a 6) suggests that sticking to an aggressive approach now is likely optimal.\n\nThus, with the current hand totaling 24 against a threshold of 46, we should take an extra card (Hit) to move our total closer to N while leveraging the opponent’s likely eventual bust risk.\n\nAnswer: Hit","We currently have 35 points with a safe margin of 11 below the threshold (46). Drawing an additional card (“hit”) means that as long as we draw a card valued 11 or less we stay safe, while only drawing a Queen (12) or King (13) – about a 2 in 13 chance – would make our total exceed the limit. Given our score history and knowing the opponent’s fixed strategy (where they seem to push close to or even over the threshold), it’s worth taking the moderate risk (≈15% bust chance) in order to increase our total and make it harder for the dealer to beat us. Based on this reasoning, the optimal move at this stage is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, we are currently at a total of 37 with a threshold (N) of 46. That means we can safely draw a card as long as its value is 9 or lower (since 37 + 9 = 46) – any card of value 10 or higher (10, J, Q, K) would put us over the limit. In an infinite deck the probability for a safe card (Ace counted as 1 up to 9) is 9\/13 (about 69%), while there is a 4\/13 (30%) chance to bust immediately.\n\nLooking at the past rounds, we see that our opponent (the dealer) tends to continue drawing cards until reaching a certain level—even sometimes going over the threshold—and this “fixed strategy” does not change. In many rounds the dealer’s moves (with both low thresholds and higher ones) ended with totals that either went over or ended up lower than us. In the current round the dealer’s only known card is a 6, which is relatively low, but they have already taken two hits and have three cards (one face-up plus three drawn cards) though most of their cards are still unknown to us. We cannot be sure that the dealer will stop at a safe total below ours.\n\nOur own sum is 37, which is about 9 points shy of 46. Given the high chance (roughly 70%) that a hit will increase our total safely (to somewhere between 38 and 46) and bring us closer to the threshold—thus allowing our hand to compete better against the dealer’s likely outcome—it is worth taking the risk. Standing at 37 would be too conservative, especially knowing that the dealer’s fixed approach historically pushes their total near or even over the limit.\n\nTherefore, the decision is to take another card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, your total is already 48 while the threshold is 46. Since you’ve already exceeded the limit (even though you have not yet declared a stand), you are in a “bust” state. The rules state that if one side exceeds N and the other side does not, then that side loses; however, if both go over, it’s a draw. At this point, taking another card (“Hit”) won’t improve your situation because regardless of what you get, your total will still be above 46. There is no way to “get closer” to 46 when you’re already over—it won’t help win; the best you can hope for is that your opponent also exceeds 46 (leading to a draw) rather than staying safe.\n\nThus, your optimal move in this situation is to stop taking cards by choosing to Stand. This choice maximizes your chance (albeit only achieving a likely draw) while avoiding any worsening of your situation. \n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the rules, the player is allowed to hit repeatedly until deciding to stand or until the card total exceeds the threshold N. In this round N is 46, but the cards in your hand – ['Q', 'Q', 'J', '2', 'J'] – add up to 48 (since Q = 12, J = 11, and the numerical card 2 = 2). That already puts you over the threshold. Even if you hit, you can only add to your total. Once a side exceeds the threshold while the other does not, that side loses. In the move history you already chose to stand on Turn 4. With a card total of 48, there is no benefit to taking another card. Therefore, the optimal (and only reasonable) decision is to remain where you are, i.e. to continue Standing.\n\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Given that you have plenty of room to hit without immediately risking an overshoot (and knowing the expected card value is around 7), it makes sense to try to improve your total rather than stand on such a low value. In this situation, hitting is the more favorable option, especially when the opponent’s unknown card leaves their true standing uncertain.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is 16 while the threshold N is 32. Even if you pick up the highest card possible (a King worth 13 points), you’d only reach 29, which is still below 32. Thus, there’s little risk of busting on your next hit and you have plenty of room to improve your total. Considering that both players are aiming to be as close as possible to 32 without exceeding it, hitting gives you a better chance to reach a competitive total before the opponent.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, you currently hold 26 while the opponent’s cards total is unknown but is expected to be higher given their previous two hits (and their average drawn value from an infinite deck is around 7 per card). With a threshold of 32, if you take a hit you have a 6⁄13 (about 46%) chance of drawing a card that is 6 or lower, which will bring your total into the range of 27–32. Although a hit carries a higher chance (7⁄13, or about 54%) of busting (drawing a card 7 or above), standing with 26 would almost certainly leave you at a disadvantage compared to your opponent’s likely higher total. Considering the risk and the fact that the opponent is expected to get close to N, the chance to improve your total by hitting outweighs the risk of busting in this situation.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Let's analyze the situation:\n\n1. Your current cards are [8, 6, 2, 10, 5] and the sum is 31. The threshold N is 32, so you are 1 point away from the limit.\n2. You already hit three times. The opponent, who began with a face‐up card (8) and an unknown card, then hit two times and stood on Turn 3. Thus his final hand consists of 4 cards (one known and three drawn later), and his final total is unknown but is the sum of 8 plus three independent draws (each uniformly drawn from the 13 possible card values: 1, 2,…, 10, 11, 12, 13).\n3. If you choose to stand with 31, then the outcome is determined by comparing your distance from 32 with the opponent’s total. In our analysis we note the following for the opponent’s final total T = 8 + (three independent cards):\n  – If T > 32, the opponent busts and you win.\n  – If T < 31, you win because your 31 is closer to 32.\n  – If T = 31, it is a draw.\n  – If T = 32, the opponent is exactly at the threshold and wins.\nBased on a detailed enumeration (using the fact that there are 13³ = 2197 possible outcomes for the three unknown cards) the chances work out so that if you stand your expected score comes out to be approximately 0.92 points.\n\n4. Now, if you choose to hit:\n  – Since you have 31, any card other than an Ace (value 1) will put you over 32 (bust). There is a 1\/13 chance of drawing an Ace, which would bring you to 32 – an ideal total.\n  – However, with the 12\/13 chance you bust. When you bust, if the opponent also busts the round counts as a draw; otherwise, you lose. A detailed probability analysis shows that if you hit, your overall expected score is only about 0.22 points.\n\nThus, standing (keeping your 31) yields a much higher expected score than risking a hit.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current situation, your total is only 9 points while the threshold is 32. With such a low total, you’re far from reaching the target value without risk and have plenty of room to draw additional cards safely. Therefore, it makes sense to take another card (Hit) to improve your hand.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given your current total is 14 and the threshold N is 32, you are far from the limit and can safely take another card. There is no risk of busting on one hit because even the highest card value (13) would bring your total to 27, still below 32. In contrast, standing with 14 makes it very unlikely to win against an opponent who will likely take cards to approach 32. Since your opponent’s strategy appears consistent (as seen in Round 1) and your current hand is weak compared to what you might achieve by hitting, it is best to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is 18 while the threshold is 32. Since any single card drawn (with a maximum value of 13) will keep you safely under 32 (because 18 + 13 = 31), taking another card is risk‐free at this turn. In addition, given that you need to beat your opponent who already shows an Ace and already took two hits, you should aim to get closer to 32. Therefore, the best move is to request another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the given situation, your current total is 29 and you are only 3 points away from the threshold of 32. If you choose to hit, you risk immediately busting unless you get an Ace (value 1), a 2, or a 3 – which, with an infinite deck and 13 equally‐likely ranks, works out to only about a 23% chance to hit safely. On the other hand, if you stand at 29 then the opponent (whose fixed strategy already shows three hit rounds this game) will complete his turn. Although his exact total is uncertain, the risk of busting is high (as we saw in Round 1) and his overall expected total from several random draws is around 29 as well. Given that a hit carries a very high risk of busting (roughly 77% chance) while standing gives you a chance to win if the opponent busts or if he ends up with a total equal to or lower than yours, it seems more prudent to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation, our current total is 23 (with cards J and Q, valued 11 and 12) and the threshold is 28. If we choose to hit, we have only a limited “safe” zone—only an Ace (1), 2, 3, 4, or 5 won’t immediately put us over 28. That means there is only a 5-in-13 chance (about 38%) of drawing a safe card; drawing any card valued 6 or higher (8 out of 13 possibilities) would make us bust. Although a successful hit could get us closer to 28 (or even hit it exactly if we draw a 5), the risk of busting (and therefore potentially losing the round if the opponent does not bust) is very high.\n\nLooking at the opponent’s past rounds, he tends to take several hits from a low starting point—even sometimes busting himself. In the current situation his visible card is only a 4 so his starting total is low; therefore, it is likely that even if he takes hits he might bust or finish with a total not far above 23. By standing at 23 we are avoiding the high immediate bust risk and banking on the possibility that the opponent’s pursuit of a high total will backfire.\n\nTherefore, the best move in this situation is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on our analysis we compute that our current total is 23 (J = 11 and Q = 12). With a threshold of 28 the maximum we can add safely is 5. If we choose to hit, only cards with a value of 1 (Ace), 2, 3, 4, or 5 will keep us in the safe zone; that’s 5 out of 13 possible values—a probability of about 38.5%—while the remaining 8 out of 13 cards would cause us to immediately exceed 28 and lose the round. Although hitting might improve our total if we draw one of the safe cards, the risk is high, and standing with 23 could well be enough if the opponent does not build a significantly higher total.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current round, you only have a total of 16 while the threshold is 43. With an infinite deck and card values ranging from 1 (for Aces) to 13 (for Kings), there’s no risk of busting from your next hit (16 + maximum 13 = 29, still well below 43). Furthermore, given that your goal is to get as close to 43 as possible without exceeding it, you obviously want to improve your current position. Also, comparing with the previous rounds where you played aggressively enough to win against the opponent’s fixed strategy, it’s clear that staying on 16 is too far below the threshold. The safer and more competitive approach is to hit now.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current situation, our total is 27 and the threshold is 43. Since the highest possible card value is 13, drawing one more card will bring us to at worst 27 + 13 = 40, which still safely remains in the game. Given that standing now with 27 is a very low total compared to the possible target of 43—and our opponent’s visible card is only a 6—it is very likely that the opponent will try to improve their total further. Meanwhile, our previous rounds show that winning with a total in the high twenties is risky if our opponent is free to hit more under a higher threshold.\n\nBecause we have no chance of busting on this hit (27 + any card ≤ 40), and being below par in terms of closeness to 43 could result in a loss at settlement, the optimal decision now is to request an additional card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the evaluation, your current total is 29 with a threshold of 43. Since you can add any card (even the highest value of 13) without busting—in the worst case you’d have 42—it’s reasonable to try to improve your hand. Also, your opponent—whose strategy in earlier rounds shows that they continue to hit until they feel safe—might eventually get closer to 43. Playing conservatively at 29 might leave you at a disadvantage. Therefore, taking another card (“Hit”) is the better move to try to get closer to 43 and improve your odds of winning the round.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your cards total 30 and the threshold is 43. Since the highest card value is 13 (a King), any card you draw will bring your total to at most 43 (30 + 13 = 43), so you cannot bust by taking one more card. Getting closer to 43 is clearly advantageous in winning by being closer to the threshold once both you and the opponent finish drawing. In addition, your opponent already has hit three times and holds one visible card (6) plus three unknowns. With your margin of 13 points before reaching the limit, taking another card is risk‐free while possibly improving your relative position. \n\nThus, the optimal move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, you already have a total of 42 out of a threshold of 43. This means that if you hit, only an Ace (worth 1 point) would bring you exactly to 43; any other card (with a value of 2 or higher) would push your total over 43 and cause you to bust. Since the chance of drawing an Ace is only about 1 in 13 (given the infinite deck with 13 types of cards), it is very risky to hit.\n\nFurthermore, your opponent has already ended their turn. Their fixed strategy led them to stop at turn 4 with an unknown total that they likely believe is competitive—possibly close to 43 but not over, based on the past rounds. By standing at 42, you avoid the nearly 92% chance of busting. Although your total of 42 is just one point shy of the threshold, the risk associated with hitting outweighs the small chance of improvement.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move in this situation is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current game situation, your total is 14 with a threshold of 31. Since any card drawn will add at most 13 (from a King) and 14 + 13 = 27 still remains under 31, there’s no risk of busting on your first move. Waiting might give the opponent a chance to strengthen his hand with his unknown card. Considering the advantage of increasing your score closer to the threshold without the risk of immediately busting, the optimal move is to request an additional card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current situation we hold 25 points while the limit is 31. That means we still have a margin of 6 points available—and if we can safely add a card of value 6 or less, we can approach or even hit the optimal 31. Although hitting carries a risk (because drawing a card valued 7 or above will immediately bust us), the chance to improve our total is significant. Meanwhile, the opponent’s only known card is a 3; given their fixed strategy from previous rounds it seems likely they will try to improve, and a final total of 25 is relatively low. Considering these factors, the risk–reward balance suggests that trying for a better total is worth it. \n\nTherefore, the optimal choice in this situation is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Our current total is 34, which is already above the threshold N of 31. Because exceeding the threshold means you’re bust unless your opponent also busts, there is no benefit in drawing another card. Hitting would only add to your total, further increasing your bust amount, while standing gives the opponent a chance to also bust (which would result in a draw) rather than a guaranteed loss if they stay under the threshold. Therefore, the optimal move in this situation is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","My analysis:\n• With a threshold of 31 and you holding a total of 12, you have plenty of “room” – any single extra card (maximum value 13) will still bring your total to at most 25 (12+13). This means you can hit safely without risking an immediate bust.\n• Reviewing the previous rounds, your opponent’s strategy appears fixed and sometimes takes extra cards to try to get close to the threshold. Seeing that his open card is a '4' (a relatively low value) and his unknown card is hidden, you have little immediate information to suggest that standing with 12 would be competitive.\n• At 12, you are far away from the threshold. The potential benefit of drawing one or more cards outweighs the minimal risk in this situation.\nThus, the best play is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current situation we have a total of 21 while our limit is 31, which means we are 10 points away from the maximum allowed. When considering a hit, only a card with a value of 10 or less is “safe” because drawing an 11‐point card or higher (i.e. J, Q, or K) would cause us to exceed 31. In an infinite deck with 13 equally likely card types, the safe probability is 10\/13 (≈77%) and the risk of busting is roughly 23%. Given that 21 is relatively low compared to the threshold—and considering that in previous rounds winning often went to the player who could edge closer to 31—we stand to gain an improved total (likely in the mid‐20s or higher) that better competes against the opponent’s likely draws. Although there is a risk of busting, the chance of safely improving our hand is strong enough, especially since staying at 21 could allow the opponent to catch up. \n\nThus, the optimal decision is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current total (22) and the threshold of 31, we still have enough room (a margin of 9) to take an extra card. While there’s a risk of busting if we draw a 10 or face card (which are worth 10+ points given the values assigned), the probability of drawing a safe card (Ace through 9) is relatively good given the infinite deck assumption. Our previous rounds indicate that aiming for a total close to the threshold has paid off, and the opponent’s visible card (a 4) is weak. Therefore, the optimal move is to take a hit in an effort to improve our total and get closer to 31 without busting.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total already stands at 34 against a threshold of 31, which means you’ve exceeded the limit. This means you’re effectively “busted” regardless of your next card. Since taking an extra card (a Hit) can only increase your total further while the opponent might still end up busting (or if not busting, you’d lose because they are closer to the threshold), your best—and only—option is to choose Stand. Standing now means you won’t worsen your already “busted” total, and if the opponent also exceeds the threshold later, the result will be a draw (which scores 0.5), rather than a loss.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the rules, once your total exceeds the threshold (here, 31), you’re automatically in a “bust” state. In this round your cards are ['7', '5', '9', 'A', 'Q'], which add up to 34 (7+5+9 +1+12 = 34). Whether you add more points (by taking another card with a hit) or remain at 34, you are already above the limit. Since winning only occurs if one side is over the threshold while the other is not, your only chance for a positive score is if both sides go over—the result then being a draw—and the outcome is independent of how far you exceeded the threshold. Thus, taking another card won’t improve your situation; it can only increase your total unnecessarily.\n\nFurthermore, according to the move history in previous rounds the player’s decision to stand is final and once you have chosen to stand you cannot “un-stand.” In the current round you already stood on Turn 4; although it appears that it is Turn 5, you technically have completed your part. The only remaining actions will be taken by your opponent following their fixed strategy.\n\nIn short, since your sum is already 34 (i.e. over 31) and any hit only worsens the matter without any chance at a win, the best (and indeed only) proper move is to stand and let the opponent act.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Looking at the current round, the threshold N is 31. Your cards are ['7', '5', '9', 'A', 'Q'] which total 34. Since only values up to 31 are allowed and exceeding N means you “bust,” your total 34 already exceeds the threshold. (Recall that aces count as 1, and Q counts as 12, so 7 + 5 + 9 + 1 + 12 = 34.) \n\nIn this game you are allowed to hit until you decide to stand or until your total exceeds N. Since you have already exceeded 31, your hand is “busted.” Hitting will only add to your total (even though in terms of the game’s rules being over N is just a bust, it does not bring you closer to 31), so there is no benefit to drawing another card. \n\nThus, the only viable option is to have already chosen “stand” so that you are locked in at 34. This may potentially result in a draw (if your opponent also busts) rather than a loss, while there is no possible benefit from trying to draw another card. \n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation, your total is only 7 while the threshold is 28, which gives you a lot of room to take additional cards without risking a bust immediately. Moreover, your previous rounds show that being aggressive can work well, especially when your total is far from the threshold. Even though the opponent has an Ace showing and one unknown card, the safe strategy here is to improve your hand further. Therefore, the best move is to ask for another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, you currently have a total of 13 with a threshold of 28. Since your total is quite low compared to the threshold—and because drawing any card (from 1 up to 13) will not cause you to exceed 28—it is in your best interest to draw another card. This move will allow you to get closer to 28 and remain competitive against your opponent, whose upward potential (given one Ace and two unknowns) is not guaranteed to be high. Therefore, the best move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round with a threshold of 28, your total is 18 while the opponent already has one known card (an Ace) and three unknown ones. In previous rounds with similar thresholds the opponent tends to take several hits to approach 28. Standing on 18 would be too low relative to what the opponent is likely to achieve. Also, from 18 you have room to safely take another card (you can hit as long as you add no more than 10; note that cards with values 11, 12, or 13 would bust you). With an approximately 10\/13 chance (about 77% chance) of drawing a safe card and getting closer to 28, hitting gives you the chance to improve your hand and win the round. \n\nTherefore, the best action is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the rules, you must stop taking cards (Stand) once you exceed the threshold (N). In this round, the threshold is 28 but your current total is 29. Since you’re already over the limit, taking another card won’t help—you’re already busted, and hitting further would only worsen your situation. Therefore, the best move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the rules, you may only hit until you decide to stand – or until your total exceeds N. In the current round the threshold is 28 and your cards are ['2', '5', '6', '5', 'J'] with a total of 29. That total exceeds 28. (In this game an “exceed” means you’ve already gone over the limit.) In fact, you already chose to stand on turn 4 so you cannot change your hand. Now you must wait to see what happens with the opponent. If the opponent finishes with a total within the limit (28 or less) you lose; if they also exceed 28 the round is a draw. There is nothing you can do now but stand with your current (over‐threshold) score and hope for the opponent to also bust.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the game rules, the result is determined as follows: if you already exceed the threshold, taking another card (Hit) won’t improve your standing because—even if you somehow get a “better” bust—the final settlement rule simply declares that if both players exceed the threshold, the outcome is a draw. In the current round your total is 29 (with the cards 2, 5, 6, 5, and J valued 11) while N is 28, meaning you have already gone over. Adding another card will only make your total even higher, and it has no impact on the fact that you are bust relative to N. Since the opponent’s strategy may allow them to finish with a valid (non-busted) total if they decide to stop at the right moment, your best expected result in this situation is achieved by not worsening your bust further. Thus, you should not hit but simply stand and let the opponent complete their turn. \n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on our current round we have a total of 22 and need to beat (or outdo) our opponent who shows only a 3. With the threshold at 45 there is a very large margin before busting – even the maximum card of 13 would only bring our total to 35. Meanwhile the opponent’s hidden card is unknown (with an average value around 7) and his fixed strategy in previous rounds shows that he is sometimes too aggressive (even busts) and sometimes too timid. In either case, with our sum only at 22 we still have plenty of “room” to safely take more cards. Increasing our total toward 45 should improve our chances of winning the round. Therefore, the best move in this situation is to take an additional card – in other words, Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I recommend you request another card (Hit). Your current total of 23 is far from the 45‐point threshold, and since any additional card (maximum of 13 points) won’t immediately risk busting, you have ample safe room to build a stronger hand. Given the opponent’s visible card is only 3 (which is low), their eventual total will likely need several high cards to approach 45, giving you a chance to improve your position by aiming for a higher total. Therefore, taking another card now (Hit) is the optimal decision.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that our current total is 35 and the threshold is 45, by standing we risk being outpaced by our opponent who is likely to continue drawing with a relatively low current score. On taking an extra card, we have chance outcomes as follows – if we draw a 1 through 10, our total will lie between 36 and 45, which improves our standing; however drawing a J, Q, or K (values 11, 12, or 13) will push us above 45 and result in an immediate bust. With an infinite deck assumed to give an equal 1\/13 chance for each of the 13 card values, the probability of drawing safely (a card from 1 to 10) is 10\/13 while the risk of busting amounts to 3\/13. \n\nAt a total of 35, our gap from the threshold is 10 points. If we do nothing, our opponent (who already hit twice) has room to build a total much closer to 45 safely. On the other hand, hitting gives us a strong chance (approximately 76.9% chance) to improve our hand toward or right at the threshold, whereas standing at 35 has little chance of winning. \n\nThus, based on the analysis and the potential for a higher winning probability, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the analysis, with your total at 37 and the threshold being 45, you have exactly an 8‐point margin. That means any card with value 9 or higher (9, 10, J, Q, or K) would make you exceed 45 and cause an immediate loss if the opponent does not also bust. On an infinite deck where each card type is equally likely (each of the 13 possibilities having probability 1⁄13), exactly 8 out of 13 cards (Ace valued 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8) are “safe” draws that would not bust you. This gives you a roughly 61.5% chance to improve your total to a value between 38 and 45 (with an average safe increase of 4.5, resulting in about 41.5 on average) and a 38.5% chance to bust immediately.\n\nIf you stand at 37, you leave your total rather low relative to the threshold, and looking at previous rounds the opponent is managing to push their total quite high even starting with a low face‐up card. Given that their strategy seems consistent (always hitting if below a certain target) and you have the historical record to see that higher totals have often been necessary to secure wins, the risk is justified by the opportunity to get closer to 45.\n\nTherefore, even though there is a significant bust chance when drawing (38.5%), the increase in contesting power against an opponent who is likely to improve their total means that you should hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation: your current total is 41 with a threshold of 45. If you hit, only cards of value 1 (Ace), 2, 3, or 4 keep you safe (since 41 + card ≤ 45), which is 4 out of 13 possibilities (about 31% chance). There’s roughly a 69% chance of busting straight away. Given that your opponent’s strategy so far typically involves aggressively drawing extra cards (often risking overshooting the threshold), your best chance is to avoid the high risk of busting. Standing now with 41 gives you a strong chance to win if the opponent busts or stays below your total.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current round’s configuration we are at only 15 points with a threshold of 37, and there is no possibility of busting with a single extra card (since the highest card is 13). In addition, the opponent’s upward starting total (with a shown Ace worth 1 point) and hidden card leaves significant uncertainty, and past rounds show that the opponent tends to take extra cards when needed. Therefore, it is in our best interest to improve our hand and avoid the risk of being too far from 37 when the opponent finishes their turn. The proper strategy is to request another card – Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round the threshold is 37 and your total is 19 (from cards ['9','6','4']). With the maximum card value being 13 the risk of busting on a single hit is nil (19+13 = 32, which is still below the threshold). Since your goal is to be as close to 37 as possible and your total is quite low, you should request an additional card. Given that the opponent’s fixed strategy hasn’t depended on drawing conservatively in similar previous rounds, you gain an advantage by increasing your total toward the threshold. Therefore, the optimal move in this situation is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round, you have a total of 30 while the threshold is 37. With one more card you risk busting if you draw an 8 or higher (which is 6 out of the 13 possible card types) but have a safe chance (7 out of 13) to improve your total to somewhere between 31 and 37. Standing on 30 puts you in a risky position against an opponent who—as seen in previous rounds—tends to hit early and work toward a higher total. In order to be competitive this round and have a realistic shot at getting as close to 37 as possible, it is best to take the chance for an extra card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Our current total is 40 (9+6+4+J(11)+10), which already exceeds the threshold of 37. Since adding any card (a Hit) only increases our total further (and there’s no mechanism to reduce the total), there is no chance to bring it back to or below 37. According to the rules, if one side exceeds N and the other does not, the one that does not exceed wins; if both exceed N then the result is a draw. Thus, we cannot win this round—but we might hope that the opponent also exceeds 37, in which case the round would be a draw (earning 0.5 score) rather than a loss (0 score).\n\nSince taking another card cannot possibly improve our situation (and in any case we’re already bust), the best move is to stop (Stand) now, leaving our total at 40 and hoping that the opponent will end up over the threshold as well.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given that your current sum is 24 (from two Queens worth 12 each) with the round’s threshold of 32, you have room to improve your total without immediately risking busting. When you choose to hit, you add a card to your score, but to avoid going over 32 you can safely add only a card with value ≤8 (since 24 + 8 = 32). In an infinite deck where every card value (Ace=1, 2–10 as numbers, and J=11, Q=12, K=13) is equally likely (1\/13 chance each), about 8 out of 13 cards will keep your total at or below 32. This gives you roughly a 61.5% chance to get a safe card, with an average safe increase of about 4.5 points. That would bring many outcomes into the high-to-very-high twenties, improving your chance to be closer to 32 than your opponent.\n\nLooking at previous rounds, your winning totals were often in the upper 20s or even touching 31. Since the opponent’s face-up card is a King (worth 13) and their hidden card is completely unknown, their starting point is uncertain—and they appear to follow a fixed strategy that, while unpredictable at times, has not demonstrated extreme caution. Standing on 24 leaves you likely behind if the opponent manages to build a higher total without busting. Therefore, taking a calculated risk by hitting now to try to improve your hand offers a better prospect of winning this round.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Since your total is 31 with a threshold of 32, any hit is very risky. In this round, if you hit you must draw a card and the only card that won’t make you bust is an Ace (which only occurs with probability 1\/13). With a 92% chance of busting, it is far better to stand and hope that the opponent either busts or ends up with a total below your 31. Therefore, the optimal move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

When you hit, you risk busting only if you draw a King (worth 13) since 14 + 13 = 27, and that event has a relatively low chance (roughly 1 in 13, assuming equal likelihood for all ranks). With the opponent showing a Queen (12), it is likely that the dealer’s overall total could be better, so you should aim to improve your hand toward 26. Given the low probability of immediately busting and the need to get closer to the threshold, the optimal strategy in this situation is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","In this situation your total is 24, which is just 2 points away from the limit of 26. The probability of drawing a card that does not bust you is very low – only an Ace (worth 1) or a 2 would leave you at 25 or 26, while any card 3 or above would exceed 26. Given that the deck has 13 equally possible cards, you have just a 2\/13 chance (about 15%) of drawing a safe card, while there’s an 11\/13 chance to bust immediately. In contrast, standing at 24 offers you a chance to win if your opponent busts or ends with a lower score, and you avoid the extremely high risk of busting by hitting. Therefore, the best decision is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current situation, you have a total of 14, and the threshold for busting is 29. Since even the highest card (K worth 13) would bring you to 27 (which is still under 29), there is no risk of busting on your first hit. Additionally, the opponent shows a J (11), and while their unknown card may give them a good total, you are quite far from the threshold. It is thus advantageous to add another card to approach 29 and improve your winning chances.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total (18) and the fact that the opponent’s fixed strategy led them to hit in Turn 1 (and likely they will try to reach near the threshold of 29), it seems suboptimal to stand with such a low total. With a current total of 18, drawing a new card gives you about an 11\/13 chance of staying under the threshold (since only draws of Q (12) or K (13) would bust you, causing your total to exceed 29) while bringing your total closer to 29. This increased total improves your chance of winning against an opponent who will likely try to roll even closer to 29. Therefore, given the risk\/reward balance, the optimal move in Turn 2 is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Our total is 26 and the threshold is 29. If you take a hit, you run the risk of drawing a card that adds 4 or more points—which would bring your total above 29 and cause you to bust. In an infinite deck with 13 equally likely cards, only an Ace (worth 1), a 2, or a 3 would keep you at or under 29 (a 3⁄13 chance, about 23%). With roughly a 77% chance of busting, the risk is too high. Since the opponent’s fixed strategy does not cause you any extra contrivance for taking such a high risk and you already have a good total of 26, the best decision is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Let's analyze the situation. You currently have four cards: A (1), K (13), 4, and 8, so your total is 1 + 13 + 4 + 8 = 26. The threshold for bust is 29, meaning you have a margin of 3 points. If you choose to hit, only cards having a value of 1, 2, or 3 will keep you within the limit (26 + card ≤ 29). Since the deck is infinite and there are 13 possible card types, only 3 out of 13 cards (roughly 23%) are “safe” draws. The remaining 10 cards (about 77%) would make you exceed 29, which would result in a loss if the opponent hasn’t busted.\n\nThe opponent (dealer) already has five cards in total—even though only the first one is known ('J')—and based on his fixed strategy he has hit several times. His next move is not under your control, and his strategy has remained unchanged. Given that the risk of busting is very high if you hit and your current score of 26 is already fairly close to the threshold, standing is the optimal decision.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the analysis of the situation, here are the points to consider:\n\n• Your current total is 26, and the threshold is 29. Taking one more card means risking a bust if the drawn card is 4 or greater.\n• Only cards with values 1, 2, or 3 (that is, Ace, 2, or 3) will add safely to your total (yielding 27, 28, or 29) – that’s 3 out of 13 possible card types from an infinite deck. The risk of busting (drawing one of the 10 other cards) is therefore high.\n• Although a higher total is usually better when standing off against an opponent trying to get as close to 29 as possible, the odds of safely improving your score (about 23%) are not in your favor.\n• With your opponent having already taken several cards (and not yet declaring a stand), it’s likely that their smaller cards have kept their sum below a dangerous level. In other words, they appear to be drawing cautiously or according to a fixed strategy that you’ve already seen once.\n  \nConsidering the extreme likelihood of busting on another hit, the most prudent choice in this situation is to stand with your current total of 26.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current situation, your total is only 14 with a threshold of 27. Since the values range from 1 to 13, no drawn card will cause you to exceed 27. Therefore, you have a free chance to improve your score. Given that your opponent’s face‐up card is a 4 (which provides little information and likely indicates they may need extra hits to get a good total), it is in your best interest to try to accumulate a higher total. The optimal decision is to request another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given your current total is 17 and the threshold is 27, you have a considerable margin for improvement. By hitting, you have about a 77% chance of drawing a card (values 1–10) that keeps you safely under 27, while only a roughly 23% chance of drawing a bust card (J, Q, or K). Your opponent’s visible card is only a 4, and from the history it appears that their strategy tends to lead them to draw heavily (in both previous rounds, the opponent often exceeded the threshold), which increases the risk that they will bust or end up with a lower safe total. Therefore, by taking a hit, you are working toward getting closer to 27 while the risk of busting is relatively low. \n\nFinal decision: Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Here’s the reasoning: Your total is currently 22 with a threshold of 27. If you choose to hit, you must add a card value between 1 and 13. However, to stay safe you can only draw a card of 5 or less (since 22 + 6 = 28 would exceed 27). That means there are 5 “safe” outcomes (Ace=1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) out of 13 possible values—giving you roughly a 38.5% chance to improve your hand without busting. On the other hand, there is about a 61.5% chance you’ll bust immediately by drawing a 6 or higher.\n\nLooking at the opponent’s past rounds, they’ve been following a fixed (and rather aggressive) strategy that tends to push them over the limit in later rounds. Although their face‐up card in this round is only “4”, making their current apparent total low, you have to remember that they are inclined to hit repeatedly. That said, if you bust by hitting, you lose immediately, whereas if you stand on 22, you avoid that very high immediate risk—even though your hand isn’t as close to 27 as it might be if you hit successfully.\n\nThus, given that 22 is already a moderately safe total and the unfavorable odds (over a 60% chance to bust) if you try for a “better” total by hitting, the optimal decision is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current round: you only have a total of 9 points with two cards (['7', '2']), and the threshold is a high 38. With plenty of room before reaching the limit, it is best to try to improve your hand with an additional card. Additionally, the opponent’s shown card is a 6, which is relatively low, and you have no enough information to assume they will reach a strong total without hitting. Therefore, the optimal move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the rules and current board conditions, your total is 14, which is very far from N = 38. With an infinite deck and the values being relatively low, there is little risk of busting when you hit at this stage. Additionally, your opponent’s face-up card is a 6, and though two cards are unknown, it is hard to rely on their strategy without risk. To reach a competitive total closer to the threshold and maximize your chance to be closer without busting, it is best to request another card. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round information:\n• The threshold is very high (38) compared to your current total of 17.\n• No matter which card you draw (the highest card, K, is 13), you won’t exceed the threshold on this hit.\n• Your goal is to get as close to 38 as possible without busting so you can outperform your opponent.\n• Looking at previous rounds, the opponent’s fixed strategy has led them to overshoot the threshold each time.\n• With a total of 17, it’s wise to take an additional card (“hit”) now in order to have a fighting chance against your opponent’s likely aggressive play.\n\nTherefore, the best move for turn 3 is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, you have a total of 29 with room before reaching the threshold of 38. If you decide to hit, any card with a value of 9 or less will keep you safe (since 29 plus that value stays at or below 38), while a 10, Jack, Queen, or King will bust your hand. With an infinite deck and all 13 ranks equally likely, you have a 9\/13 chance (about 69%) of drawing a safe card and a 4\/13 chance (about 31%) of busting. Considering that the safe cards would likely bring your total closer to 38 (with a safe draw averaging around 34), the risk–reward tradeoff favors hitting in this situation.\n\nAlso, note that in previous rounds your opponent’s moves (against lower thresholds) consistently resulted in busting or drawing well above the threshold. With the current threshold increased to 38, it is even more beneficial for you to try to improve your hand (if you can do so without busting) given that you can eventually edge out the opponent with a higher total. Thus, to maximize your chance of winning this round, you should take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation and past rounds, you’re at 31 while the round’s threshold is 38. There’s a 46% risk of busting if you draw a card that’s too high (an 8 or above) and a 54% chance of drawing a “safe” card (Ace through 7) that would bring you closer to 38—possibly even exactly to 38 if you draw a 7. In previous rounds the opponent’s fixed strategy led him to hit on every turn (or nearly so) and eventually crash (even if his “safe count” sometimes came very close, he nevertheless ended up busting). Although a stand at 31 might be safe if the opponent busts, looking at the numbers it seems you’d benefit from trying to move your total up towards 38. Even though hitting carries nearly a 50% bust risk on one more card, if the card is safe you improve your chance of beating the opponent (since his fixed brutal hitting pattern seems to yield a high bust rate as well).\n\nThus, the better move here is to “Hit.”\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, your current total is only 18 out of a threshold of 49. Even though the opponent shows a Q (valued 12) and an unknown card (with an average of 7), his total is likely near 19 or so at the start. Yet, given that the threshold is very high and you’re far from 49, you have plenty of “room” to safely take extra cards.\n\nObserving the past rounds, the opponent has consistently “hit” several times (even sometimes exceeding the threshold) before stopping. With your total at 18, standing now would almost certainly leave you significantly behind the opponent’s anticipated total once he completes his moves. In order to have a chance of catching up and approaching the high threshold value, you need to improve your hand.\n\nTherefore, the best move in this situation is to request another card—that is, to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current hand totaling 27 and with the threshold at 49, we still have a very safe margin (22 points) before risking a bust even if we pull one of the highest‐valued cards (13 points). Meanwhile, our opponent’s visible card is a Q (worth 12), and although we don’t know their hidden cards, the history shows that they tend to hit repeatedly (often causing them to bust or end up with a very high total) until the later stages of each round. This gives us both information and an opportunity: by hitting, we can improve our position, getting closer to 49 without a significant risk of busting, while our opponent is likely to continue taking risks according to their fixed strategy. \n\nTherefore, the optimal move right now is to request an additional card – Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round—with a threshold of 49, our hand totaling 40, and knowing that the opponent (following their fixed strategy) has already taken two hits – it looks like we’re still about 9 points below the safe limit. Even though “hitting” carries a roughly 4\/13 (about 31%) chance of busting (since any card 10 or higher will push us over 49), about 9 out of 13 times (roughly 69%) we will safely improve our total. Improving our score can help counter what appears to be the opponent’s tendency to hit repeatedly (as seen in previous rounds). By standing at 40 we risk giving the opponent a chance to continue drawing—especially since with a very high threshold of 49 they can afford more cards and end up closer to 49 without busting. \n\nThus, weighing the risk versus reward in increasing our score from 40 (with improvements possible up to 49 if we draw a “9”) and knowing that the opponent is likely to push their luck further, the optimal decision now is to ask for another card—a “Hit.”\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current state, your total is exactly 49, which is exactly the threshold. Drawing another card (hitting) would necessarily result in a total greater than 49 since the minimum card value (an Ace) is 1. Therefore, to avoid busting, you should not take another card. Your optimal move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation, your current total is 49, which exactly meets the threshold (N = 49). Since any additional card (even an Ace worth 1) would cause you to exceed the threshold, the optimal move is to choose not to take further risks by hitting. Therefore, you should Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current situation, you have a total of 22 while the threshold is 40. Even if you draw the highest‐value card (which is K with 13 points), your total would be 22 + 13 = 35—still safely below 40. Since your hand is far from the maximum and there is plenty of room to improve your total without risking an immediate bust, you should ask for another card. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, you already have a total of 23, and because the maximum card value is 13, drawing one more card is completely safe on this turn (23 + 13 = 36, which is still under the threshold 40). In order to get as close as possible to 40 and increase your winning chances while still remaining safe, it’s sensible to take another card. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current hand and the rules, you currently have a total of 27 with a threshold of 40. No matter which card you draw next, even the worst‐case card (a King worth 13) will only bring you exactly to 40 (27 + 13 = 40), so you cannot bust on this hit. In contrast, if you stand at 27, you risk losing to the opponent if they manage to safely get a higher total closer to 40. Your observations of previous rounds indicate that the opponent often keeps hitting—even overshooting—so there’s a chance they will bust; however, if they play cautiously and come in close to 40, you want to have as high a score as safely possible. Since you have an available “safe” range (all possible card values keep you within threshold) and aiming to improve your score is important, the best decision is to request another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Considering our total is 39 with a threshold of 40, taking one more card is extremely risky. The only card that would improve our hand without busting is an Ace (worth 1 point), which has roughly a 1 in 13 chance, while any other card will push us over 40 and result in a bust. Since the opponent’s strategy so far has involved repeated hits (which in many cases have led them to bust), it is likely that they may be forced into another hit or might already have a risky total. In our situation, standing with 39 maximizes our chance to win or at least draw rather than risking an immediate bust on a hit. Therefore, our best move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Our total is 39 and the threshold (N) is 40. By hitting, we gain an extra card that adds to our sum; however, since only a card worth 1 (an Ace) keeps us at or below 40 (39 + 1 = 40), any card drawn from the infinite deck (where each of the 13 values is equally likely) would most likely cause us to exceed the threshold. The safe outcome has a probability of only 1\/13, while drawing a card of value 2 or more (with 12\/13 chance) will make us bust. Given that we already have a very strong total (just 1 point shy of the threshold) and our opponent’s unknown cards can still lead to their bust or a lower total, it is optimal to avoid this unnecessary risk.\n\nTherefore, the best move in this round is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current situation, your total is only 10 with a threshold of 34, so you have a very large “safety margin” before risking a bust (since even a 13 would bring you to 23). In past rounds the opponent’s face‐up card (a “Q” worth 12) did not provide enough information to assume they will play conservatively. In order to get closer to 34 and guarantee a better chance at winning before the opponent reaches an aggressive sum, you need to take advantage of the low risk right now. Therefore, you should choose to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, you have a total of 15 against a threshold of 34. Because the maximum card value is 13, even if you pick the highest card you’d reach only 15 + 13 = 28, which is still safely below the threshold. With such a wide margin and given your opponent’s apparently very aggressive approach in previous rounds (often busting as they seem to keep hitting), it makes sense to improve your score when you have so much room without risking an immediate bust. Therefore, the best strategy is to request an additional card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that the threshold is 34 and your current total is only 20, every possible card you might draw (values ranging from 1 to 13) will keep you safely under the bust‐limit (20 + 13 = 33, which is still under 34). In addition, because the goal is to get as close to 34 as possible without exceeding it, standing at 20 would leave you far behind if your opponent improves their total. Furthermore, with the opponent showing a \"Q\" (worth 12) and already having two unknown cards, there’s a good chance they are building a high total. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to hit and seek a higher total toward 34.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that the threshold is 34 and your current total is 27, you have a “safety margin” of 7 points. That means if you take a hit, you must draw a card that is 7 or lower in point value (Ace counts as 1) — there are 7 “safe” outcomes out of 13 possible card outcomes. This gives you roughly a 54% chance to remain under or exactly at 34, but a 46% chance to bust immediately. Meanwhile, your opponent has already completed their moves. Looking at our past rounds the opponent’s aggressive play has led them to often overshoot the threshold and bust. With your 27 you are already in a relatively safe zone; standing gives you the benefit that if the opponent busts (which seems likely based on previous rounds), you win automatically. On the other hand, improving your total by risking a hit (which on average might only bring you to around 31) is not worth the nearly 50% bust risk.\n\nTherefore, in this situation the best course is to stand. \n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current round conditions, your total is only 12 while the threshold is 33. With an infinite deck and card values ranging between 1 and 13, even the highest card (K = 13) would bring your total to only 25. This gives you plenty of room to draw additional cards without the immediate risk of busting. Also, analyzing past rounds shows that your opponent has a tendency to draw aggressively, often ending up bust. By hitting now, you are increasing your chance to build a strong hand that approaches 33 while keeping your risk very low at this early stage of the round.\n\nThus, you should choose \"Hit.\"\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the current round, your total is 14 and even if you draw the highest‐value card (K = 13), your total would become 27, which is still under the threshold of 33. There is no risk of busting on this hit and you have plenty of room to improve your hand toward 33. Also, based on previous rounds the opponent consistently follows their fixed aggressive strategy, so you should aim to improve your total as much as possible without busting. Therefore, your optimal move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our analysis, with a threshold of 33 our current total of 23 leaves us with a gap of 10. In this game the safe hit is very promising because drawing any card valued 1–10 keeps us within the threshold and moves us closer to 33 (with 10 exactly reaching it), while only drawing a J, Q, or K (each busting us) has a probability of 3\/13. Compared with standing at 23—which would leave us too far from 33 and allow our opponent, who has already taken two hits, a chance to get even closer—it is optimal to take another card. Therefore, our best move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your current hand is ['J', 'A', '2', '9', 'K'], its total is 36, which exceeds the threshold N of 33. According to the rules, if one side goes over the threshold and the other does not, the side that is over loses. Since your total is already above N, you are in a losing position regardless of whether you take another card or not. In fact, taking an additional card (hitting) would only increase your total further without any chance to improve the outcome. Therefore, the best (and only) available action is to stand and accept that your hand is already over the threshold.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Let's analyze the situation:\n\n• The round’s threshold is 33.\n• Your cards are ['J', 'A', '2', '9', 'K'] which sum to 11 + 1 + 2 + 9 + 13 = 36.\n• Since 36 exceeds the threshold of 33, you have already busted.\n• Given that you already exceeded N, you have no incentive to request (hit) another card; standing is the only (and final) option.\n• Even though it’s turn 5 in the move history, you already chose stand on turn 4, and your total remains 36.\n\nThus, the best move is to stand (even though you are over the threshold and will lose the round if the opponent does not bust as well).\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the analysis, with a threshold of 38 and your current total at 13, you are very safe to request another card. Since you’re far below 38 and the opponent’s showing card is 9 (with a hidden card that, on average, is around 7), there’s ample room to improve your hand. Reviewing previous rounds, you’ve seen that building a competitive total is key to maximizing the win probability. Given the high threshold and the fact that you can add several cards without busting, the optimal move is to take another card—hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the board and our previous rounds, staying with a total of only 21 out of a threshold 38 isn’t very competitive. In all past rounds the opponent’s fixed strategy has shown a tendency to hit aggressively—even if they end up going over—so if we stop now our hand is too far from 38. Since no single hit can “bust” us (because the highest card, 13, when added to 21 gives only 34, which is still under 38), it is strategically best to take another card in order to improve our total and get closer to the threshold. That extra point from hitting now may be the difference needed against the opponent’s risky play.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given our current total of 34, we are just 4 points shy of the threshold of 38. At this moment the chance for a safe card if we hit is only those with value 1–4 (4 out of 13, roughly 31%), so over two‐thirds of the cards would put us over the limit. In contrast, our opponent’s past rounds show a tendency to keep hitting (often busting) even when the threshold is moderately high. Standing with 34 avoids the high risk of busting while allowing us to benefit if the opponent follows their pattern and goes over 38. \n\nTherefore, our best move in this situation is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current situation, your total is 15 (from cards 9 and 6) and the threshold is 36. Even if you draw the highest‐value card (which is a King worth 13 points), your total would become 15 + 13 = 28—still well below 36. This means you face no risk of immediately going over the threshold (busting) on your first hit. In contrast, standing at 15 would leave you far from the target, giving your opponent a better chance to get closer to 36 without busting.\n\nGiven these considerations and weighing the benefits of approaching 36 closer while not risking an immediate bust, the best move in this round is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that the current round has a threshold of 36 and your current total is 21, you have plenty of room to take additional cards without the risk of immediately busting—even if you were to draw the largest possible card (K = 13, giving you 34, which is still below 36). Because your opponent’s upcard is a low 4 and his remaining cards are unknown, you are at a disadvantage when holding a weak hand. Since there is zero immediate risk and more room to improve your total before approaching the threshold, the best move is to request another card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 23 and the fact that drawing any card (even the highest, 13) will bring you to at most 36 (23+13 = 36, which is still within the threshold), there is zero immediate bust risk if you choose to take another card. In order to get as close to 36 as possible and beat the opponent—who in previous rounds using the fixed strategy often continued drawing until reaching a high total—it is optimal to request an additional card at this stage.\n\nThus, your best move in Turn 3 is to: Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, my current total is 31 with a threshold of 36. If I choose to hit, only cards with values 1–5 (an Ace, 2, 3, 4, or 5) keep me within the limit; that’s 5 out of 13 possibilities (about 38% chance to stay safe), while the other 8 out of 13 cards would cause me to exceed 36 immediately (a bust). In contrast, standing at 31 isn’t very high, but the opponent’s record shows that they often overdraw (bust) by following a fixed strategy—and besides, their only visible card is a low 4. Considering they have already taken three hits and risk busting themselves under threshold 36, the conservative option of standing seems to be wiser in this situation.\n\nThus, it is more optimal to avoid the high risk of busting by taking another card. I choose to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Since busting is very unlikely at this stage and a higher total will be needed to beat an opponent who may eventually approach 28, the best choice is to ask for another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation “Round 1\/10” with a threshold of 28 and your current total of 23, you are currently below what would be competitive if your opponent later builds a higher total (especially since reaching 28 is the ideal “safe” high total). Even though hitting at 23 carries a high risk—because only cards of value 1–5 (Ace counts as 1) keep you at or below 28 (a 5\/13 chance) while drawing a 6 or more (8\/13 chance) results in busting—the fact that 23 is fairly far from 28 means that standing now is likely to be less competitive if your opponent improves from his starting Ace. Given that only a 5 would take you directly to 28 and the other safe cards leave you with totals 24–27, it is most strategic to try to improve your hand if you want to be closer to 28 (and ultimately win the settlement).\n\nTherefore, despite the high risk of busting with one hit (about 61.5% chance), the fact that 23 is not a strong total in a game where both sides are aiming as close as possible to 28 leads to the decision to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Since you're already at 28 (exactly the threshold N), hitting would add at least 1 point (since the smallest card, Ace, is worth 1), which would push you over 28 and result in an automatic loss unless your opponent were also to bust. Meanwhile, your opponent has already chosen to stand, so their hand won’t change. Thus, the best decision is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current situation, your two cards total only 16, which is significantly below the threshold of 38. Since even the highest card (a K worth 13) would only bring you to 29 (16 + 13 = 29), there is no immediate risk of busting if you take another card. In contrast, the opponent’s face‐up card is a 6, and their hidden card is unknown, but given their fixed strategy and the relatively high threshold, it’s likely that the opponent will continue drawing until approaching a safe total. To maximize your chance of winning by getting as close as possible to the threshold without exceeding it, your best move is to request an additional card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 22 with a threshold of 38 and noting that drawing any card (even the highest value of 13) cannot make you exceed 38 (22 + 13 = 35, which is still under 38), it is optimal to request an additional card (\"hit\") to get closer to the threshold.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, you currently have a total of 30 while the threshold is 38. This means you are 8 points away from the limit. Because the deck is infinite and the card values range from 1 to 13 (with higher values causing a bust if they push you beyond 38), a hit will only be safe if you draw a card between 1 and 8. There are 8 safe outcomes out of 13 possible cards (approximately 61.5% chance) and a 38.5% chance you’ll bust.\n\nOn the other hand, the opponent has already taken two hits and is showing a 6. Their remaining cards are unknown, but with a threshold as high as 38 they are likely to aim for a relatively high total (closer to 38) to beat a middle total like 30. Sticking at 30 may leave you at a disadvantage if the opponent manages to get a stronger hand.\n\nConsidering that you have enough room (an 8‐point gap) to risk one more hit and potentially improve your total (to anywhere between 31 and 38), and given that a total of 30 is relatively weak in a round where the threshold is 38, the optimal strategy is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, here’s the reasoning:\n\n• Your current total is 32, which is clearly too far away from the threshold 38 to feel comfortable standing. Even though drawing another card carries a risk of busting if you receive 7 or higher (which is 7 out of 13 chances, or about 54%), staying at 32 puts you at a disadvantage because the opponent already has several cards and is following a fixed strategy that seems to bring their total closer to the target (their expected total in a comparable situation is around mid‐30s). \n\n• On the other hand, if you hit you have a 6\/13 probability (about 46%) of drawing a card that will keep you in the safe zone (a card value 6 or below). In the best case—a 6—you’d reach exactly 38, the threshold, and almost guarantee a win (assuming the opponent must still follow their strategy). Even getting a safe draw (values 1–5) would improve your total to a point (33–37) that gives you a better chance than standing at 32.\n\nTaking into account that better positioning is vital when your opponent’s fixed behavior seems to aim for an average total in the mid‐30s, the expected gains from increasing your total outweigh the risk of busting immediately (especially since a total of 32 is not strong enough to hope for a win if the opponent improves). \n\nThus, the correct move is to take a hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current total of 37 with the threshold being 38, taking another card is extremely risky. Only drawing an Ace (worth 1) would keep us safe (bringing our total to exactly 38), but with an even chance (1 out of 13) of that happening, hitting carries a high probability of busting if any other card is drawn. Therefore, the best move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on our current situation, our total is 12 (with cards A [worth 1] and J [worth 11]), and the round’s threshold is 33. Since the maximum card value is 13, drawing one more card cannot immediately cause a bust (12 + 13 = 25, still below 33). In addition, being quite far from the threshold puts us at a disadvantage if we stand now. Given that our opponent’s face‐up card is a J (value 11) and we have no further information on their strategy aside from their past moves, it’s wise to try to get closer to 33 to improve our chances of beating them. Therefore, the optimal decision in this situation is to ask for another card – in other words, Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation you have a hand totaling 22 and a maximum allowed value of 33. That means you can add up to 11 points safely. The deck contains 13 card types, with the safe cards (Ace counted as 1, cards 2–10, and J=11) being 11 types, and only Q=12 and K=13 (2 types) causing you to go over 33 if added. That gives roughly an 84.6% chance (11 out of 13) of drawing a card that won’t bust you immediately.\n\nFrom previous rounds, your opponent’s fixed strategy shows that he tends to take several hits. Improving your hand from 22 will likely increase your chance of staying ahead in the final tally. Given that the probability of busting on a hit is relatively low (about 15%) and that your current hand is not very competitive at 22, the best decision is to take another card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current hand with a total of 26 (from cards A [1], J [11], 10, and 4) and knowing that the round’s threshold is 33, our safe margin is 33 – 26 = 7. In other words, if we request (“hit”) one more card, only cards with values 1 through 7 will keep us safe; drawing an 8 or higher would make us bust. Because every card is equally likely from an infinite deck (each of the 13 values has the same chance), our chance to draw a safe card is 7\/13 (roughly 54%).\n\nIf we stand at 26, we run the risk that our opponent—whose face‐up card is J (11) and who already took two hits—may be able to get closer to 33 without busting. Observing previous rounds, the opponent has consistently taken extra cards (even sometimes overshooting the threshold) and seems to use the same fixed strategy regardless of the round’s N. Their unknown cards suggest they are aiming for a higher total, which means that sticking with a 26 might not be competitive.\n\nOn the other hand, if we hit, there is a decent chance (approximately 54%) that our new total will become between 27 and 33. This would put us in a much stronger position relative to the opponent’s expected mysterious total. While there is a notable risk (around 46%) of busting immediately, the chance to improve our hand enough to compete effectively makes the “hit” decision favorable.\n\nThus, given the risk‐reward balance and our need to approach the threshold to beat the opponent’s hidden total, the optimal move in this situation is to request another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","We note that your current total is 32, while the round’s threshold is 33. That means if you take another card you’re in a very dangerous situation – even the smallest card will push you over 33 except in the one case where you draw an Ace (worth 1 point), which would bring your total exactly to 33. Since the deck is infinite and every card value is equally likely (with an Ace having a 1⁄13 chance and all others a 12⁄13 chance), hitting exposes you to about a 92% chance of busting. Meanwhile, standing at 32 leaves you just 1 point shy of the threshold. Although the opponent’s unknown cards make it a bit of a gamble, his fixed strategy (as seen in earlier rounds) has risked both busts and borderline totals. In this situation it is far safer to stand rather than risk an immediate bust from a hit.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation, your total is only 15 while the threshold is 38, meaning you have plenty of room to draw additional cards without immediately risking a bust. In previous rounds, you’ve seen that playing conservatively (standing too early) may leave you at a disadvantage against your opponent's fixed strategy. Rather than stand on a low total, it is better to try to improve your score. Therefore, the optimal move in this round is to request another card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Your current hand totals 23, and because the threshold is 38, even the highest card (13) would only bring you to 36—safely below the limit. Therefore, there’s no risk of busting on a hit. Since you want to get as close as possible to 38 to beat your opponent, the best strategy in this situation is to ask for another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round the threshold is 38 and your total is 25. Because every card’s value (minimum 1 – maximum 13) will keep you at or below 38 (25 + 13 = 38 exactly), there is no danger of busting if you take one more card. To maximize your chance of being as close as possible to 38 (and likely beating the opponent’s result), the best move is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your current total is 35 and the threshold is 38, if you choose to hit you risk busting. When you hit, only drawing a 1, 2 or 3 will keep you safe (bringing your total to 36, 37 or 38), and that chance is 3 out of 13 (roughly 23%). There is a 10 out of 13 (around 77%) chance that you’d draw 4 or above, which would put you over the threshold immediately. Although a higher total might beat your opponent if they improve their hand, the enormous bust risk makes hitting an unattractive option in this situation. Thus, standing on 35 is the safer choice.\n\nAnswer: Stand","I analyzed our situation. With a threshold of 30 and our current total at 20 (from an 8 and a Q, where Q is 12), we are 10 points below the limit. In a game where the target is near 30 rather than 21, stopping at 20 would likely leave us at a disadvantage against an opponent who seems to be aiming high (as seen in previous rounds). Meanwhile the risk of busting on a hit isn’t too high—in an infinite deck the chance of drawing a card that would make us exceed 30 is only when the drawn card’s value is 11, 12, or 13 (about 3\/13 probability). Drawing a card from 1 to 10 (with probability 10\/13) brings us closer to 30. Thus, our optimal move is to take a card now (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given your current total is 26 and the threshold is 30, if you hit you risk busting unless you draw one of {A, 2, 3, 4}. That gives you a roughly 4⁄13 chance of a safe card and a 9⁄13 chance of going over 30. Observing the opponent’s prior rounds and fixed strategy, standing with 26 is the safer bet since the risk of busting is very high when trying to draw without many “safe” cards available. \n\nTherefore, the recommended move for the current round is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on our current situation, our hand totals 26 and we’re 4 points away from the threshold (30). If we choose to hit, we only avoid busting if we draw a card valued 1, 2, 3, or 4 (because 26 + card ≤ 30), which happens with about 4 in 13 chance; with about 9 in 13 chance, we’d exceed 30 and bust. Although a safe card would improve our chances significantly (especially if we get a 4 to reach 30), the risk of busting is very high. Meanwhile, if we stand with 26 the opponent still must try to reach near 30 (and his history shows he usually continues until he reaches his own safe stopping point or busts). In this scenario the risk\/benefit leans toward avoiding the high bust probability. \n\nThus, the recommended move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current round’s situation you have a total of 26 against a threshold of 30. This means you’re 4 points shy of N. If you choose to stand, you run the risk that your opponent – whose fixed strategy in past rounds appears to aim for a total around N minus a couple of points – may improve his hand to a total higher than yours. On the other hand, if you hit, the only safe card values are Ace (1), 2, 3, or 4 because any card with value 5 or more will cause you to exceed 30 and bust. With 13 card types in an infinite deck, that gives approximately a 30% chance to draw safely and improve your total (to 27, 28, 29 or exactly 30). Even though that bust risk is nearly 70%, you are currently behind what the opponent is likely aiming for and being conservative (standing at 26) would give him an advantage if he boosts his score with his own hits.\n\nGiven the goal is to be as close to 30 as possible without busting, and considering the opponent’s behavior in previous rounds, it’s advisable to take the risk when you are 4 away from the threshold. Therefore, the optimal move in this situation is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, you have two Q’s (each worth 12) for a total of 24, and the round threshold is 48. Because you’re currently far from 48 and your opponent’s visible card is a K (worth 13) with an unknown second card, you need to improve your hand in order to outscore the opponent without “busting.” The history shows that it’s advantageous to try for a higher total when you start with a relatively low score (24 out of 48), and the opponent seems to hit until reaching near the threshold when possible. Therefore, the best move is to request an additional card (Hit), in hopes of getting closer to 48 while staying safe. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your current total is only 28 out of a possible 48 and historical rounds show that playing closer to the threshold tends to win, it is wise to improve your total. In addition, drawing another card is relatively safe as even the highest card (with a value of 13) would leave you at 41—well under 48. Meanwhile, the opponent’s visible card is a K (value 13) and his strategy so far has been to take additional cards. With margin to work with and a likely strategy from your opponent to reach near the threshold, your best chance is to draw another card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Let's analyze the situation:\n\n• You currently have Q (12), Q (12), 4 (4), and 8 (8). The total is 36, and the threshold is 48.\n• You need to get as close to 48 as possible without exceeding it. Standing at 36 leaves a 12‐point gap.\n• When hitting, you risk only drawing a card that makes your sum exceed 48. Since card values are from 1 (Ace) up to 13 (K), drawing a King (value 13) would cause a bust (36 + 13 = 49). All other cards will leave you at or below 48.\n• The probability of drawing a King is 1 in 13 (about 7.7%), which is relatively low. This makes the risk acceptable given that 36 is still quite a bit away from 48.\n• Additionally, you know your opponent already hit twice; their face-up card is K (13) and they have additional unknown cards. Their final total could be close to or exceed your current 36 if they continue drawing, making your hand vulnerable if you don’t improve it.\n  \nThus, given the safe risk and the opportunity to get closer to the threshold, the best move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, you currently have a total of 45 with a threshold of 48. That means if you hit, you only have room for a card of value 1, 2, or 3 to keep you at or under 48—there’s roughly a 3-in-13 chance of drawing one of those cards while you face a nearly 77% risk of busting. Meanwhile, the opponent’s playing style (as seen in previous rounds) suggests that they work cautiously when the remaining margin is very slim; they’ve usually stopped when adding any further card would entail a high risk of busting. With your 45 you are already very near the cap. Even though hitting could bring you a slight improvement (to 46 or 47—and ideally 48 if you draw a 3), the high risk of busting makes it much less attractive. Standing on 45 gives you a strong chance to win, as the opponent is likely to be more cautious and may not reach as high a total.\n\nThus, the best decision this turn is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation and rules, you already have a total of 45 when the threshold is 48. If you choose to hit, you run the risk of drawing any card valued 4 or above—which happens roughly 10 out of 13 times—resulting in a bust. On the other hand, standing at 45 means you are only 3 points away from the threshold, and while the opponent’s full hand is unknown, they must work under the same constraints; moreover, your past record shows that when you approach the limit safely (similarly to previous rounds), you force the opponent into uncertain territory. Taking into account that hitting gives only a 3\/13 (about 23%) chance to improve your total (by drawing a 1, 2, or 3) while risking a bust almost 77% of the time, the balance of risk favors you standing.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current situation and our previous observations, our current hand totals just 18 while the threshold is a very high 48. In previous rounds the opponent has been drawing several cards to get close to the threshold without busting. With so little risk of busting at this early stage (18\/48), our optimal strategy is to draw additional cards (Hit) in order to build a competitive total that has a chance to exceed the opponent’s eventual sum without going over 48. \n\nTherefore, our recommended move now is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation – your total is only 21 compared to the high threshold of 48, and there is no risk of busting with the next card since the maximum card value is 13 (resulting in a total of 34, which is well under 48) – the best move is to continue hitting so you can get closer to 48 and stand a chance to beat your opponent.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round:\n• The threshold is 48 and your current total is only 26.\n• Since every card is between 1 and 13, even the highest‐value card (13) wouldn’t bust you (26 + 13 = 39, well below 48).\n• With your opponent already showing a Q (worth 12) and a fixed strategy that tends to add cards aggressively when below the threshold, your chance to improve and get closer to 48 is vital.\n• Standing now at 26 would leave you at a strong disadvantage when the opponent eventually stops.\n\nThus, the optimal move is to take another card and improve your total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current total of 36 with a threshold of 48, we have a relatively large cushion. When we hit, there is only a 1 in 13 chance (drawing a King, worth 13) that we bust, while any other card will bring us closer to 48. With only a small risk of going over, a hit seems the optimal play to improve our total. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, your current total is 45 and you are playing with a threshold of 48. Drawing another card (a hit) would be very risky—only an Ace, 2, or 3 (which occur with about a 3\/13 probability if we assume uniform likelihood over the 13 card types) would keep you at or under 48, while any higher card immediately pushes you over. Although a slightly higher total (46, 47, or exactly 48) could beat the opponent if they’re playing to a roughly similar target (as seen in previous rounds), the risk of busting (approximately 76.9%) is far too high. In previous rounds, the opponent’s pattern has led to totals around mid-40s, and given that you already have 45, standing now maximizes your chance to either win or at least draw. \n\nThus, the recommended move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current round, your total is only 9 (with cards ‘3’ and ‘6’), and the threshold is 24. Since none of the possible card values (1 for Ace, 2–10 for number cards, 11–13 for face cards) can push you over 24 when added to 9, you are in a very safe position to request an additional card. Also, while the opponent’s visible card is a 9, you have plenty of room to build a stronger hand. In this situation the optimal move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the game state, your current total is 16 and you’re still a significant distance from the threshold of 24. With a threshold of 24, you can only safely add 8 or less without busting (since 16 + any card of value 9 or higher would exceed 24). Because the deck is infinite with an equal chance for each of the 13 possible cards, there is roughly a 61.5% chance (8\/13) that an additional card would keep you under the threshold. Meanwhile, the opponent’s visible card is 9 and, given that they have a fixed strategy which has sometimes led them to risk going over 24, you’ll need to try to get closer to 24 yourself to improve your winning chance.\n\nBy hitting now you have a reasonable probability of getting closer to 24 without busting, thereby increasing your chance of beating your opponent’s unknown sum. Therefore, considering the balance between risk and reward given your total and the opponent’s upward trend in previous rounds, the best move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation we have a hand totaling 25 with plenty of room under the threshold 43. In our past rounds we’ve seen that a total of 25 is far from the optimum for winning against a dealer (opponent) that keeps drawing cards to get as close to N as possible. Also, with the dealer showing a King (worth 13) as the up card and an unknown second card, his starting total can be anywhere from 14 to 26. Given that our total is relatively low and we’re far from 43, it is best to take another card (Hit) so that we can try to get closer to 43 and thereby beat the dealer’s likely eventual total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the information provided, your current total is 29 and the round’s threshold is 43. Since even the highest card (a King is 13 points) would only bring your total to 42 (29 + 13), hitting is safe because you won’t bust. In order to maximize your chance of coming closer to 43 and beating the opponent, you should ask for another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","We are currently at Round 9 with a threshold of 43. Your hand is ['K','Q','4','6'] giving a total of 35. With 43 as the limit you’re still 8 points short of a “perfect” 43. You already took two extra cards (turns 1 and 2) and now are at turn 3. \n\nIf you stand now, your total remains 35, which is a little low given that the opponent (whose first visible card is a strong K valued at 13) will likely try to get closer to 43. They already hit twice and their hidden cards can easily bring their total to the high 30s without busting. \n\nOn the other hand, if you take another card (hit), you have about 8 out of 13 chance to draw a card with a value between Ace (1) and 8 that won’t cause you to bust. (Safe cards: Ace,2,3,4,5,6,7,8; bust cards: 9,10, J, Q, K which means roughly a 38.5% risk.) Although there is some risk, the probability of not busting is roughly 61.5% and — if you are lucky — you’ll improve your hand to somewhere between 36 and 43. A higher total improves your chance to beat the opponent who, following his fixed strategy, is likely aiming for a total as close as possible to 43.\n\nConsidering the situation\n• Your total of 35 is too far from the threshold compared with what the dealer (opponent) is likely to achieve,\n• There’s a decent probability (~61.5%) to safely improve your hand,\n• The opponent’s visible K (13) hints they might build a strong hand,\n\nthe better decision is to hit one more time to get closer to the threshold and increase your winning chances.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 10 (with your cards 3 and 7) and the generous threshold of 45, you have a lot of room before ever risking busting. In previous rounds the dealer (opponent) sometimes ended with totals well into the 30s or even 40s, and you can see that playing too conservatively (standing early) at low totals leaves you at a disadvantage. With an average card value of about 7, hitting now puts you closer to 45 while still leaving a significant safe margin. The opponent’s fixed strategy (as seen in prior rounds) does not appear to be especially aggressive in conserving a low total; rather, they tend to hit until they have a moderately high total. Thus, waiting with only 10 would be too risky. Pursuing additional cards (i.e. “Hit”) is the correct play to build a competitive total so as to have a chance of beating your dealer’s eventual hand.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your current total is only 11 and the threshold is 45, there is plenty of room to safely request another card. There’s no risk of going over N on one more card (even if you draw the highest possible value, 13, your total would become 24, still far below 45), which means you have a good chance to improve your hand closer to the threshold. Therefore, according to the rules and the game situation, your best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, your hand only totals 13 while the threshold is 45. Even if you draw the highest-value card (K = 13) and get to 26, you’re still comfortably under 45. With such a low total, you need to improve your hand so you have a strong chance against your opponent (especially since their face‐up card is just a 2, which may be deceptive). The risk of busting is minimal at this stage, so you should take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the game situation, your current total is 14 while the threshold is 45. Considering that you’re very far from reaching 45 safely and that the opponent’s strategy has shown a tendency to keep hitting until building a much higher sum, standing with only 14 would almost certainly leave you far behind. It is much safer to take another card to try to improve your total toward 45 while keeping an eye on the risk of busting (exceeding 45). Therefore, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is 21 and the threshold is 45. Since even the highest possible card value (13 for the King) added to your current total (21 + 13 = 34) will still keep you safely below the threshold, you have plenty of room to take another card without being at immediate risk of busting. Moreover, your opponent has been continuously hitting for the first four turns, which strongly suggests they are aiming to build a significantly higher total. With only one known card ('2') visible for your opponent, their overall total is still unclear, but it is very likely they are building a hand close to 45 given their actions in previous rounds. \n\nTherefore, the reasonable strategy is to \"Hit\" on turn 5 in order to get closer to the threshold while staying safely within limits. \n\nAnswer: Hit","It’s best to try getting closer to 45. Your current total is 30, and since any card you hit (even a King at 13) will still keep you under 45 (30 + 13 = 43), you can safely hit to approach the threshold and outdo the dealer’s likely total. Standing with 30 would leave you 15 points short, which is less competitive given the opponent has already taken five moves and stopped—likely with a stronger total. Hence, you should ask for an additional card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current situation, our total is 38 and the bust limit is 45. This means we have a margin of 7 points; drawing a card valued between 1 and 7 is safe (since 38 + 7 = 45), while drawing any card valued 8 or more would force us over the limit. In an infinite deck with the given values (Ace = 1, numbers 2–10 as written, and face cards J = 11, Q = 12, K = 13), we have 7 “safe” card types (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) out of 13 possible types. That gives a probability of about 7\/13 (roughly 54%) to get a safe card when hitting.\n\nStaying at 38 leaves us relatively low compared to the target of 45. Against an opponent who already completed his moves (standing on previous turns), his hidden total could very well be significantly higher. With a hit, if we draw safely, we can improve our sum—ideally reaching higher numbers such as 45 itself if we draw a 7. Although there is a 46% risk of busting, the extra chance to improve our standing (and possibly win the round) makes the additional hit the preferable choice in this situation.\n\nThus, our best decision now is to take another card—Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I analyzed the situation. Your hand totals 44 and the threshold is 45. Because any draw other than an Ace (value 1) would immediately push your total over 45—causing an automatic loss—and you only have a 1\/13 chance to draw an Ace from an infinite deck, the risk of busting is extremely high (about 92.3%). Meanwhile, the opponent’s fixed strategy has him stop early; his unknown cards likely put him under or at the threshold (and he’s already chosen to stand in his previous turns). Given that standing with 44 gives you a reasonable chance to win (or at least draw if the opponent also reaches 44 or 45) while hitting almost certainly causes you to lose, the better decision is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Also, being only at 16 gives you a large gap to reach 33 compared to your opponent’s likely sum (shown partially as 10 + unknown). It is advantageous to try and get closer to 33 to beat the dealer while you’re at such a low total.\n\nTherefore, the best move in this round is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your current total is 20 and the threshold N is 33, note that any card you draw from the infinite deck will have a value between 1 (Ace) and 13 (King). Since 20 + 13 equals 33, there’s no risk of busting on one more hit. Moreover, standing with 20 would be far from the maximum target of 33, which could make it tough to beat an opponent who is likely aiming for a higher total. As your opponent already took one hit, they are probably working toward a closer total to 33. Therefore, you should hit in order to improve your total without the risk of immediately exceeding 33.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current state, you have a total of 29 while the threshold is 33. In order to improve your total without busting, you require a hit that adds 1, 2, 3, or 4 points. However, since the infinite deck produces any one of 13 card values with equal likelihood, there is only a 4 in 13 chance (roughly 31%) to hit safely. On the other hand, there is a 9 in 13 chance (around 69%) that you’ll draw a card that pushes your total over 33, resulting in an immediate loss for the round.\n\nGiven that the risk of busting by hitting is very high compared to the potential gain (even if the increase is modest for some safe cards), it is better to avoid the risk and stand with your total of 29. Standing provides you with a chance that your opponent may also have a lower or busting score, especially since the opponent’s strategy (although fixed) is not providing you with enough information to justify taking such a large risk.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given that you currently have a total of 11 and the threshold is 36, you’re very far from risking a bust even if you draw your highest‐value card (K, which is 13, bringing your total to only 24). In addition, the dealer’s face-up card (Q = 12) doesn’t provide much insight into their hidden card, meaning you’re at an information disadvantage. With 11 points, you have plenty of safe room to build toward a higher total that will be as close as possible to 36 without exceeding it. Therefore, the optimal move in this situation is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the game board and rules, your current total is 13 (with cards ['2', '9', '2']) and the threshold is 36. With such a low total, you have significant room to improve your hand without much risk of busting (exceeding 36). Meanwhile, the opponent’s only known card is Q (worth 12 points); they already have some high card value, but you still need to close the gap to 36 to have a competitive chance.\n\nGiven that you’re far from 36 and still need to build up your score—and since the opponent’s strategy is fixed and they already took a hit in the first turn—a “hit” is the safer and more aggressive choice in this scenario.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the situation, your total is 22 and the threshold (N) is 36. Note that with card values between 1 and 13, if you add any card to 22 the sum will be at most 35 (since 22 + 13 = 35), so you cannot immediately bust by hitting. Getting closer to 36 is clearly beneficial, and since going one hit is risk‐free at 22, it is optimal to request one more card (Hit) rather than stand with a relatively low total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your current total is 29 and the threshold for busting is 36, you have 7 points of “room” left. If you take a hit, only cards 1–7 will keep you in the safe zone while cards 8–13 (the face‐cards with values 11–13 included) would make you bust immediately. In our rough probability analysis, standing at 29 gives you a win probability of roughly 70% (when comparing your 29 against the opponent’s three‐card total, which—based on the opponent’s fixed behavior—tends to be lower, since they only hit on turn 1 and then stand on turns 2 and 3). In contrast, if you hit, there’s approximately a 7\/13 chance to “improve” your total (and even then, on average the new total will be between 30 and 36, with the best case 36) but a 6\/13 chance to bust outright. An approximate calculation shows that overall your winning probability would drop significantly (roughly 48%), because while getting a “safe” card improves your chance nearly to 90% in each safe outcome, the nearly 46% bust chance hurts your overall expectation. \n\nTherefore, given these odds, you should choose to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current situation, your total is only 16 (from a 5 and a J) while the threshold is high at 49. Even assuming the worst card you can draw is a King (value 13), your total would become 29, which is still safely below 49. With such a low total and a very high threshold, there is plenty of room for improvement without the risk of immediately busting. Meanwhile, your opponent already shows a strong starting card (K, which is 13) and has an unknown second card – but since you have complete history and your opponent follows a fixed strategy, the best move for you now is to take advantage of the large safety margin and request another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your current total is 26 and even the highest‐value card (K = 13) would only bring you to 39, you are very safe from going over the threshold of 49 by taking another card. In games like this it’s ideal to keep drawing when you’re far from N, so that your final total can get closer to 49 without risking a bust. Notably, your opponent’s fixed strategy in previous rounds shows that even though they sometimes hit aggressively, their final totals in the rounds varied (one round they busted and in another they ended with 30). Your situation is clearly advantageous for improvement by hitting again.\n\nThus, in this turn your recommended action is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, here’s the thought process:\n\n• Your total is 37 and the round’s threshold is 49. You can improve your total without busting if the new card’s value is 12 or less (because 37 + 12 = 49). Only drawing a King (valued at 13) would bust you (37 + 13 = 50). Since the deck is infinite and uniformly distributed among 13 card types, the chance of busting by drawing a King is 1 in 13 (about 7.7%), while there’s a 12 in 13 (about 92.3%) chance of a safe number. \n\n• Increasing your total even a little could be critical since the opponent (whose face-up card is a King) appears to follow a fixed strategy, and given that the threshold is high (49), the opponent will likely continue to draw to approach the threshold. Holding on 37 puts you at a disadvantage.\n\n• The low bust risk along with the possibility of improving your total to a value closer to 49 suggests that hitting is the favorable action in this turn.\n\nTherefore, according to the game board and rules, the optimal move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Our current total is 41 and the round’s limit is 49. That means you have room for at most an 8‐point card before you bust; any card valued 9 or above (9,10,J[11],Q[12],K[13]) would put you over the limit. In an infinite deck where each of the 13 card types is equally likely, there are 8 “safe” cards (Ace counted as 1, 2–8) and 5 “bust” cards. Thus, if you hit you have roughly a 61.5% chance (8\/13) of improving your total to a number between 42 and 49. Drawing one of these safe cards gives you a stronger hand that is closer to N without busting. \n\nLooking at your opponent’s play in the earlier rounds, we can tell that his strategy is fixed even though it isn’t completely transparent. In both previous rounds he took hits only until his total was deemed “good enough” relative to the threshold. In this current round his face‐up card is K (value 13) and he already has four cards (one visible plus three unknowns) on board after three hitting turns. Although we do not know his exact total at this time, standing with 41 leaves you with an 8–point gap to the limit, and it might well be beaten if his fixed approach allows him to reach closer to 49.\n\nGiven the risk–reward: you have a 61.5% chance to draw a safe card if you hit now, and if you get a safe card your hand improves significantly, the best decision is to Hit rather than stand at 41.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Let's analyze the situation for Round 3. The threshold (N) is 49, but your cards \n['5', 'J', '10', 'J', '4', 'K'] already sum to 54 (5 + 11 + 10 + 11 + 4 + 13 = 54), which is over 49. According to the rules, if you exceed N then you “bust” unless your opponent also exceeds N (in which case the round is a draw). Since your total is already above the threshold, taking another card (a hit) will only add more points—it won’t bring you closer to N but rather further away. Therefore, there is no strategic benefit in hitting: whether you add another card or not, your total will remain above N.\n\nGiven that standing keeps your total at 54 and that may at least force a draw if the opponent also busts, the best choice in this situation is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the fact that your current total is 15 and the threshold is 28—with the highest possible card being worth 13—taking one additional card is risk‐free in the sense that a single hit cannot cause you to exceed 28 (15 + 13 = 28 exactly). Therefore, it is optimal to choose to hit in this situation.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, your total is 18 while the threshold is 28. Playing conservatively (standing on 18) is a poor choice since you’d almost certainly be beaten by an opponent who can safely get closer to 28. Meanwhile, hitting carries a risk: if you draw a face card (J, Q, or K; which have values 11, 12, or 13 respectively), you’ll exceed 28 and bust. However, because the game uses an infinite deck where each card (A,2,…,10,J,Q,K) is equally likely, you only have a bust probability of 3 in 13 (roughly 23%). With safe cards (values 1–10) occurring 10 in 13 chances, hitting gives you a good chance to improve your total significantly—possibly getting nearer to 28 without busting—which is necessary to beat an opponent who, even starting with an Ace, is likely following a strategy to safely approach 28.\n\nThus, to maximize your winning chances in this round, it is advisable to take another hit rather than standing with 18.\n\nAnswer: Hit","We must decide whether to take an extra card (hit) or to stop (stand) while keeping our total as close as possible to the threshold without busting. In the current round the threshold is 28 and our cards (8, 7, 3, 3) total 21. Remember, however, that if we take another card and add too high a value so that our sum exceeds 28 we’ll bust and lose (unless the opponent also busts, in which case the result would be a draw, but that is generally worse than not busting).\n\nBecause all cards come from an infinite deck, each rank is effectively available with equal likelihood. The card values are: Ace = 1, cards 2–10 as their numerical values, and face cards J = 11, Q = 12 and K = 13. That gives 13 possible outcomes. If we hit:\n • If we draw an Ace (value 1) through the 7 card, our new total becomes 21 + card value. To stay safe, we need 21 + d ≤ 28, which means d must be 7 or less.\n • The “safe” outcomes are d = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 (7 outcomes).\n • If we draw 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, or 13 (6 outcomes) our total would exceed 28 (for example, drawing an 8 gives 29) so we’d bust immediately.\n\nThus there is approximately a 7⁄13 (about 54%) chance of getting a safe card, with an average safe card value of (1+2+3+4+5+6+7)\/7 = 4. So on average a safe hit would result in 21 + 4 = 25, which brings us significantly closer to the threshold of 28 than standing at 21. While there is a risk—roughly 46% probability—of busting on that hit, our opponent (whose strategy remains fixed) is also working with unknown cards and the situation (with a relatively low threshold) suggests that reaching as close as possible to 28 is the best competitive position.\n\nConsidering that standing at 21 would leave us with a margin of 7 below the threshold, and the opponent—especially given their aggressive, fixed play—may well manage to get a higher total without busting, it is advantageous to take the risk of hitting.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation our total is 22 with a threshold of 28. Standing now almost guarantees that our score will be too low for a win. Even though hitting risks busting on cards that have values 7 or higher (a probability of roughly 54 %), if we succeed we can reach totals from 23 all the way up to 28, which considerably improves our chance against an opponent who has already taken three hits. In comparison, the records suggest that in rounds with similar dynamics and lower thresholds the opponent was able to safely stop at a moderate total; therefore, to be competitive we need to try for a higher total – even at the risk of busting. Consequently, the best move in this situation is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that the current threshold is 37 and your current total is only 7 (from your cards: 6 and A valued as 1), you have a very low score. No matter what card you receive, your total will remain far from 37, with even the highest card (a King worth 13 points) increasing your total to only 20. Since there is ample room to improve your score without the risk of “busting” immediately, it is advantageous to ask for another card. In other words, the situation is very safe for you to request an additional card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, your current total is only 12 and the threshold is 37. With many points to spare before risking busting, you need to improve your total to stand a chance of getting close to 37. In addition, the opponent’s face‐up card is only a 6, which means although you don’t know the hidden cards, there is a likelihood the opponent may need to hit further to build a competitive total. Standing at 12 would leave you far behind, so the optimal move is to request another card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","The optimal move is to Hit. With a current total of 15 and a threshold of 37, you have plenty of \"room\" to safely request another card (even the maximum card value, 13, would only bring you to 28). Given that the opponent has already taken two hits and their strategy appears fixed, building a higher total while you are far from busting is beneficial. Therefore, you should request an additional card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, here’s the reasoning: \n\n• Your total is 25 and you haven’t reached the threshold of 37 yet. With 25 you still have a gap of 12 points.  \n• When you “hit” a card, only a card valued at 13 (a King) would immediately push you over (25 + 13 = 38 > 37). All other possible cards (values 1–12) will keep you within or exactly at the threshold. Since the deck is infinite and each card value is equally likely, there is only about a 1\/13 chance (roughly 7.7%) of busting on a hit.  \n• Meanwhile, the opponent has already stood on their turn. From the history of rounds and the current move history, it is reasonable to assume that your opponent’s final total is likely higher than your current 25 (and their strategy seems to lean toward taking cards until they feel safe).  \n• Therefore, your chance of improving your total without busting is high, while standing with 25 would leave you with a weak score relative to the opponent’s likely stronger hand. \n\nGiven the low risk of busting and the potential reward by closing the gap toward 37, the best move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our hand (total 28) and the threshold (37), we have room to safely add up to 9 points. Since our opponent has already stopped in previous turns (with four cards totaling an unknown sum but likely aiming for a high total near 37) and our total of 28 seems low relative to the target, it is crucial for us to improve our total. By hitting now, we have about a 69% chance (drawing an Ace through 9) to get a safe card, possibly reaching a total between 29 and 37. Although there’s around a 31% risk of drawing a 10\/J\/Q\/K and busting, our current total is too far from the threshold to stand confidently. Therefore, the best strategy is to take the risk and hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, you currently have a total of 30 where N is 37. This means you’re 7 points away from the maximum allowed without busting. Since hitting only risks drawing a card that is 8 or higher (which would cause you to bust) and since those “danger cards” account for 6 out of the 13 possible cards in an infinite deck (roughly a 46% chance of busting), there’s about a 54% chance to safely improve your total. A safe card will add between 1 and 7 points, potentially bringing your total as high as 37 (if you get a 7). \n\nLooking at the history, you can see that standing with a lower total (like 30) has resulted in losses when your opponent’s total was higher—even if they also risk busting sometimes. With the opponent’s moves in this round (standing in turns 3–5), it seems they have locked in a total that you likely need to beat by getting closer to 37. Therefore, despite the inherent risk, the possibility of boosting your total into a competitive range (31–37) outweighs the risk of busting. \n\nThus, the optimal decision now is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current situation we have a total of 33 (with threshold 37) and only a very slim safe margin if we draw another card – only an Ace (value 1), 2, 3, or 4 would keep our total at or below 37. Since that’s only 4 out of 13 possibilities (roughly 31% chance) while the remaining 9 out of 13 would push us over and force an immediate loss, the risk of busting is very high.\n\nAlso, looking at our opponent’s play in previous rounds and knowing they have already ended their drawing (their turn ended with “stand”), their fixed strategy makes it likely that by this point they have “locked‐in” a final score that might be around the low-to-mid 30s. Our score of 33 is already in a competitive range. Increasing our total by trying to edge closer to 37 might help only if we draw one of the safe cards—but that improvement is outweighed by the high chance of busting.\n\nTaking into account these factors, the best decision is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given the current situation, your total is only 11 while the threshold is high at 41. This provides a very safe margin for drawing additional cards, as even the highest card (worth 13 points) won’t put you anywhere near the threshold. Additionally, the opponent’s visible card is only a 3, and their fixed strategy based on past rounds shows moderate risk-taking. To improve your hand without incurring much risk, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 21 (with a threshold of 41) and knowing that the worst card you could draw is 13 (which would give you 34, still safely below 41), it is optimal to take another card to try and get closer to 41. Your current score is too low to stand against an opponent who will likely continue hitting with a very low visible card ('3'). Therefore, the best move in this situation is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is 29 and the threshold is 41. With an infinite deck equally likely to produce any card value (with an average card value of 7), the only card that would bust you is a King (value 13), because 29 + 13 = 42, which exceeds 41. That gives you roughly a 1\/13 (or approximately 7.7%) chance to bust when hitting. Given that you are 12 points away from the threshold, the risk is very low and hitting can improve your total closer to 41. In contrast, if you stand at 29, the known dealer has already accumulated cards (with a visible '3') and will likely try to get closer to the threshold. With your current total at 29 and only one card risking bust, the optimal decision is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation:\n• The threshold is 41 and your current total is 30.\n• With an infinite deck the average card value is 7; however, note that if you draw a card greater than 11 you will bust (i.e. drawing a Q or K, which are 12 or 13, has about a 2\/13 chance, roughly 15%).\n• With 30, you still have room to improve (by up to 11 points) and being at 30 is unlikely to beat an opponent who is still drawing.\n• Reviewing past rounds, you see that when the opponent sticks to his fixed strategy the chance of him stopping at a low total is rather slim; your only chance is to get closer to 41.\n• So taking another card (Hit) gives you a solid chance to get nearer to the threshold without too high a risk. \n\nTherefore, the recommended move is to take an additional card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on what we know, you currently have a score of 34 when the threshold is 41. This leaves you with a “buffer” of 7 points before busting. Since playing against an opponent who has already stopped means you have the chance to improve your hand without risking that the opponent will get another card, evaluating the probabilities is key.\n\nIn our infinite deck there are 13 equally likely card types with values:\n Ace = 1,\n 2 = 2,\n …,\n 7 = 7,\n 8 = 8,\n 9 = 9,\n 10 = 10,\n J = 11,\n Q = 12,\n K = 13.\n\nIf you choose to hit, you want your drawn card to be 7 or less so that 34 + card value ≤ 41. There are 7 “safe” outcomes (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7) and 6 risky outcomes (8, 9, 10, J, Q, K) that will push you over 41 (bust). Thus the probability of being safe is 7\/13 (about 54% chance), and busting is 6\/13 (about 46% chance).\n\nIf you safely draw a card, your total would increase to between 35 and 41 — a better chance of beating the opponent’s unknown total. Standing with 34 may leave you at a disadvantage if the opponent’s hand is stronger. Moreover, your opponent has already ended drawing this round, so you have the opportunity to improve your hand payoff immediately.\n\nGiven that a safe hit not only gives you an improved total but that the chance of safe improvement is slightly greater than 50%, the risk\/reward balance in this situation favors taking another card.\n\nThus, the recommended move is:\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation we have a total of 35 with a limit of 41. That means we are 6 points shy of getting to the limit and so if we hit we must get a card with value 6 or less in order not to bust. In an infinite deck there are 6 “safe” card values (Ace worth 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) out of 13 total possible card types. Even though the chance of drawing a “safe” card is roughly 46% and drawing an unsafe card (7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, or K) is roughly 54%, our current total of 35 is not competitive if the opponent, following their fixed strategy, continues drawing to improve on their score. In previous rounds the opponent often ended with a score in the low-to-mid 30s (or even busting) when the threshold was set near the 30’s – and with the threshold now being 41 the opponent is likely trying to come closer to it. With a 35 our chance to “beat” a well‐judged opponent is diminished. Therefore the best choice is to risk one more hit so that if we draw a safe card (and especially if it turns out to be a 6 [which brings us exactly to 41]) we have a much better chance of winning. Taking into account the potential benefits of reaching a higher total (even if the safe draw probability is somewhat less than the unsafe one), the strategy here is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current round the threshold is 34 and your cards total only 14. There is essentially no immediate risk of busting on your next card because even if you pull the highest‐valued card (K, worth 13), your total would be 27 which is well under 34. In previous rounds the opponent’s strategy has been to hit until reaching a reasonably competitive total close to the threshold. With your total being very low, it makes sense to draw at least one more card in order to get closer to 34 so you have a chance to beat your opponent’s final total.\n\nTherefore, the recommended move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the evidence, you’re far from the threshold at 22 while the limit is 34. With an infinite deck and equal chances for any card value, only a King (value 13) would immediately push you over (22 + 13 = 35), and that happens with probability 1⁄13. Given that risk is low and you’re in a position where drawing one more safe card can substantially improve your chance to get closer to 34, the best move here is to “Hit.”\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the analysis of your current total (29) against the threshold (34) and the opponent’s past behavior, taking another card is very risky. You have only a 5\/13 chance (roughly 38%) of drawing a card that keeps you at or below the threshold (only cards valued 1–5 are safe) while the remaining 8\/13 chance means you would bust immediately. Meanwhile, many observed rounds suggest that when the threshold is relatively low, the opponent plays conservatively and often ends up with a safe total that is not too far from 29. In this situation, risking a hit could easily result in an immediate loss. \n\nTherefore, the best move is to stand with your current total of 29.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation:\n• Your current total is 19, which is far from the threshold (46). With only your two cards (K = 13 and 6), you need to get closer to 46 in order to have a fighting chance against the opponent.\n• Since every drawn card is from an infinite deck and the highest card value is 13, you can’t immediately bust when adding a new card. In other words, the gap (46 – 19 = 27) is wide enough that any single hit will keep you safely under the threshold.\n• The opponent’s face‐up card is a 9, but the dealer’s fixed (and previously observed) strategy suggests that they will continue playing aggressively enough to achieve a competitive score. Standing at 19 would almost certainly leave you at a disadvantage.\n• Given that the probability of busting on your very next card is zero and you need to accumulate more points to be competitive, the logical approach is to “Hit” on turn 1.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, you have a total of 32 and the threshold is 46. You can safely hit because the highest possible card value is 13 (the max is K, which is 13) and even in the worst-case scenario your total would become 32 + 13 = 45, which is still below 46. Improving your total is important, given that you want to be as close to 46 as possible before stopping. Also, from previous rounds it seems the opponent is following a set pattern where they tend to hit enough to try reaching near the threshold (even sometimes overshooting it). Therefore, sticking with your total of 32 is unlikely to win in this game; you must try to improve your score without risking busting. In this round, since there is no risk of busting with a single hit, the best move is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current total of 42 (with a very tight margin of 4 points under the threshold of 46), we have only a 30% chance or so to avoid immediately busting if we take another card (since only cards valued 1–4 keep us at or under 46, while cards 5–13 would push us over). Reviewing our previous rounds and the opponent’s patterns, the opponent tends to play more cautiously and rarely gets close to 46 when playing with a lower target. With our current safe total of 42, there is a strong chance that by standing we secure a win if the opponent does not manage to get closer without busting. Therefore, the best move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on our total of 42 versus the threshold of 46, our only “safe” extra cards would be ones with a value of 1, 2, 3, or 4. In a standard infinite deck (with four cards of each type among 13 kinds), that means only 16 out of 52 cards (roughly 31%) won’t immediately force us over the limit. With nearly a 70% risk of busting if we hit and given that the opponent is already playing their strategy toward a high but near‐threshold total, it is safer to stand on 42 rather than risk a bust. \n\nAnswer: Stand","We’re playing Round 9 with a threshold (N) of 33. Your current total is 16 (cards: 9 and 7), and the opponent shows a 9. Because the numbers on cards range from 1 to 13, even getting the highest card (K = 13) will bring you only to 29 (16 + 13), which is still comfortably under 33. This means there is no risk of busting by taking an extra card. In addition, you’re far from maximizing your score relative to the threshold. Given that your opponent’s strategy is fixed and you possess full historical information (in which we see that safe, incremental hits have helped achieve wins on similar thresholds), the optimal move is to hit to try and get closer to 33.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your current total is 20 and the threshold is 33, you are far from the target. In this round every card (even the highest‐value face card K, worth 13, would bring you exactly to 33) is “safe” if drawn now. Since you only know one opponent face-up card (a 9) and the opponent’s strategy remains fixed based on previous rounds, the best play is to draw another card in order to get closer to 33. Therefore, you should choose to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Considering that your current total is 30 with a threshold of 33, you only have a 3‐point margin. If you take a hit from an infinite deck (with 13 equally likely card types where Ace counts as 1, numbers 2–10 as their own value, and face cards as 11, 12, and 13), only cards with values 1, 2, or 3 (i.e. Ace, 2, or 3) would help you without busting. That’s 3 out of 13 possibilities—roughly a 23% chance—and a 77% chance that you will exceed 33.\n\nMoreover, from previous rounds we see that the opponent generally follows a fixed strategy where they hit until reaching a certain total close to the threshold. With a visible 9 and already two hits, the opponent’s eventual total is uncertain, but your 30 is relatively competitive given the very slim margin for improvement (and high chance to bust on a hit).\n\nThus, the safest and most strategically sound decision is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given your current total of 4 (cards: 3 and Ace) and the threshold of 29, standing now would leave you far from the target, almost guaranteeing a loss against an opponent who will likely build a higher total. Since every card drawn from the infinite deck will have a value of 1 to 13 (all safe because 4 + 13 = 17, well below 29), it’s clearly beneficial to hit and improve your hand rather than stand with 4. Therefore, the optimal move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current game state, the threshold is 29 and your current total is only 10. Since every card is drawn from an infinite deck and all cards have values at most 13, even the highest card (King = 13) won’t make your total exceed 29. In other words, you have plenty of room to safely hit and improve your score toward reaching 29 without busting. Also, because your opponent’s play is fixed and you see that in previous rounds playing conservatively when behind the threshold generally doesn’t work out, you will want to maximize your potential. Therefore, the best move at this stage is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation:\n\n• Your total is 15, and the threshold is 29. Since every possible card (an Ace is 1, numbers 2–10, and face cards 11–13) added to 15 will keep you at or below 28, there is no risk of busting.\n• With your total at 15, you are very far from the threshold; standing now leaves you at a disadvantage compared to the opponent. You need to get as close as possible to 29 to improve your chance of winning.\n• In all previous rounds we’ve seen that when the risk of busting is low, it is best to hit in order to get closer to N.\n\nThus, the optimal play at Turn 3 is to take a Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, your total is only 19 (with cards ['3', 'A', '6', '5', '4']) while the round’s maximum is 29. Standing on 19 would leave you too far from the target and almost certainly behind the opponent (who already stopped taking cards). Although there is roughly a 23% chance of busting due to drawing a face card (J, Q, or K) from an infinite deck, safe cards (values 1–10) appear about 77% of the time. In an environment where you are so far from the target, the risk is worth taking. Hence, your best decision is to ask for another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the board, you currently have a total of 25 with a threshold of 29. That means you’re 4 points away from the limit. If you choose to hit, the only safe cards are those worth 1–4 points (Ace, 2, 3, or 4). With 13 different card values available from the infinite deck, getting one of these has roughly a 4⁄13 chance (about 31%), while there’s a 9⁄13 chance (about 69%) that you’ll draw a card that causes you to exceed 29 and immediately lose (unless the opponent busts as well, which is not in your control). Meanwhile, by standing at 25, you lock in your total. Although 25 isn’t very close to 29, history shows that in comparable rounds the opponent (following a fixed strategy) often ends up with totals around 25 too—or even busts, if they try to get closer. \n\nConsidering that the risk of busting on a hit is very high compared to the modest gain that a safe card would give, the best decision in this situation is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The optimal decision here is to draw an additional card in order to get closer to 39 without exceeding it. Therefore, you should choose to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your current total is 19 and the threshold is 39, you have a comfortable margin—drawing any card (even the highest, the King worth 13 points) would only bring you to 32, which is still safely under the limit. With your opponent showing only a '4' and two unknown cards and having already taken a hit, it is likely beneficial for you to continue drawing cards to close the gap with 39. \n\nTherefore, the best move in this situation is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the rules and current situation, your total is 25 and the threshold is 39. Since every card drawn from the infinite deck has a value between 1 and 13 (with the highest being 13 from a King), drawing an extra card will only bring your total as high as 25 + 13 = 38, which is still below 39. This means that no matter what card you draw, you cannot exceed the threshold. Hence, it is safe to request an additional card.\n\nFurthermore, increasing your total puts you closer to 39, which is advantageous when compared with your opponent’s likely sum, given their strategy to always hit until a certain point. Thus, the optimal move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your total is 37 and the threshold is 39, if you choose to hit you have only a 2⁄13 chance of drawing a safe card (either an Ace worth 1 to reach 38 or a 2 to reach 39) while an 11⁄13 chance means you’d bust immediately. The opponent has already stopped and his final total is unknown; however, adding another card for you risks an immediate bust in most cases. Therefore, the much safer and strategically sound decision is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current state: your total is 9 with a threshold of 33. With such a low total, there is little risk of exceeding the threshold no matter what card is drawn (even the highest value card, K, would bring you only to 22). Since reaching closer to 33 is critical, and given you’re far behind compared to what you expect the opponent to aim for, the optimal move is to take an additional card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given your current total of 15 versus a threshold of 33, you’re very far from reaching close to 33. Since any card drawn (values 1 to 13) won’t cause you to bust (because 15 + 13 = 28, which is still below 33), it is beneficial for you to hit in order to approach the target.\n\nAnalyzing the previous round, we see the opponent’s fixed strategy involved taking hits early before standing. With your current score so low and the risk of going over 33 being nonexistent on your next draw, you should take another card.\n\nThus, based on the rules and the game situation, the optimal move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current hand total of 23 (from cards 8, A, 6, 8) and a threshold of 33, we still have some margin (33 – 23 = 10) before busting. When we hit, any card with value 11 or more (J, Q, K; values 11, 12, 13 respectively) would make us exceed 33. Since these “busting cards” represent 3 out of the 13 possible card types, we have roughly a 23% chance to bust and a 77% chance to improve our position. In addition, our opponent has already taken two hits in this round (their visible card is 7 while the rest are unknown), and they follow a fixed strategy. Considering our relatively safe distance from the threshold and aiming to outscore the opponent later, the best move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our analysis, here’s the reasoning:\n\n• In the current round the threshold (N) is 33 and your total is 28. In order to be competitive against your opponent’s fixed strategy, you need to improve your total closer to 33.\n\n• Because you have 28, you have 5 “points of room” left. However, note that if you draw a card that’s greater than 5 (i.e. a 6 or higher – note that all cards 6 and above add too many points and bust you) you will lose immediately. In an infinite deck where each rank is equally likely, only 5 out of the 13 ranks (Ace counted as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) are “safe.” That is about 38.5% chance of “safe” and roughly 61.5% chance to bust if you hit.\n\n• Yet if you stand at 28, history and your knowledge of the opponent’s fixed strategy (from Round 1) suggest that the opponent is likely to have a “safe” total that is higher (in Round 1 the opponent ended with a total very near the threshold when the rules allowed more room). The opponent’s moves so far this round (hit twice then stand) indicate that his hand will likely be in the upper range below 33—possibly around 30 or so.\n\n• Let’s sketch the outcomes when hitting:\n – If you draw an Ace (counted as 1) your total becomes 29.\n – If you draw a 2 your total becomes 30.\n – If you draw a 3, 4, or 5 your total becomes 31, 32, or 33 respectively.\nIn a head‐to‐head matchup (and assuming the opponent’s final total is around 30 and his strategy remains unchanged), reaching 31, 32 or 33 will give you a winning edge; even a total of 30 might lead to a draw.\n \n• The risk is that with approximately a 61.5% chance you bust immediately. However, standing with only 28 leaves you at a significant disadvantage if the opponent indeed holds a safe, higher total, as history suggests.\n\n• Balancing the risk and reward—the potential for a win\/draw when safe versus the sure loss when standing at 28—the analysis shows that, although hitting risks busting, it offers a chance to improve your hand to a level that can beat the opponent’s likely total.\n\nTherefore, the better move is to take a hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I'll analyze the situation. Your current total is 13 (J = 11 and 2 = 2) and the threshold is 50. Meanwhile, your opponent’s fixed strategy in previous rounds was to take exactly two extra cards (i.e. hit on turns 1 and 2, then stand thereafter), regardless of the threshold. With a visible card value K (13) and an unknown card, the opponent’s initial total is likely around 20 (since over an infinite deck the average card value is about 7). Adding two average hits (around 7 each) roughly brings his total to 34 on average, though there is some risk of busting if he draws high numbers.\n\nAt your end, your total is very far from 50, so you have plenty of “room” to take additional cards without the risk of busting. Standing with only 13 would be far too low compared to the opponent’s likely total. To have a chance at winning (or at least drawing) against an opponent who will stop after two hits, you must improve your hand significantly by taking a hit.\n\nTherefore, on Turn 1 of the current round you should Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","The best move is to Hit.\n\nLooking at our current hand, we have a total of 16 while the threshold is 50—there’s plenty of room without busting. Previous rounds show that our opponent’s strategy is fixed (hitting in the first two turns and then standing), and their totals in earlier rounds were in the 29–36 range. If we stand with 16, it is extremely unlikely that we will beat those totals. Therefore, increasing our total by hitting is the optimal choice here.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current state – you have a total of 21 while the betting threshold is 50 – taking another card is very safe because any card drawn (even the highest‐valued one, a King worth 13 points) would bring your total to only 34. With so much room before hitting the threshold, you’re far from busting and you need to approach 50 in order to beat your opponent. Thus, the optimal move this turn is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, our total is only 30 and we are far from the threshold of 50. Since any card drawn will add at most 13 (even a King gives 13, which would bring us to only 43), there is no risk of busting on this turn. Also, given that our opponent already has five cards (with only one visible value) and they have followed a hit strategy so far, improving our total closer to 50 will be advantageous. Therefore, the optimal move here is to take another card—Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 34 (with a maximum additional card value of 13 always keeping you below the threshold 50) and knowing that even the highest card drawn in a hit won’t put you over, it is advisable to improve your position by playing an extra card. This extra margin gives you room to get closer to 50 without any risk of busting on this turn. Moreover, since the opponent’s fixed strategy in previous rounds led them to stop at moderately lower totals (36 when N was 39 and 29 when N was 33), improving your total further could put you in a stronger position for the current round with N = 50.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move right now is to take another card – in other words, Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given your current total is 36 and the threshold is 50, any additional card you take will not cause you to bust because even the highest‐value card (K = 13) would bring your total to only 49. In order to get closer to 50 and improve your chances of beating your opponent (who has already stopped on turn 5), taking another card (hitting) is clearly the optimal strategy.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current state, you already have a strong total of 46 with threshold 50. If you choose to hit, you have only a 4‐in‑13 chance to draw one of the “safe” cards – an Ace, 2, 3, or 4 – each of which will raise your total to 47, 48, 49, or exactly 50. However, in 9 out of 13 cases you’d draw a card with value 5 or more, which would push your total above 50 and cause you to bust immediately. With your opponent already done drawing (their moves ended at turn 6), they’re likely already “standing” with a final total that is less than 50 (and in previous rounds their final totals were rather conservative). In this situation your risk of busting (nearly 70% chance) far outweighs the small improvement you might get over your current total. \n\nThus, given both the game history and the inherent risk–reward of drawing another card at 46 out of 50, the best move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on our current total of 12, we have plenty of room to improve without immediately risking a bust for the threshold of 37. With the dealer showing a 2 and the unknown card being, on average, around 7 points, the likelihood is that the dealer will try to build a fairly high total. Since we are far from 37 and can safely draw another card, the best move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","We are currently at 18 points with a threshold of 37. Since every card drawn is from an infinite deck with minimum value 1 and maximum value 13, even if you take the highest card (13) the total would become 31, which is still safely below 37. In previous rounds your opponent’s final totals have been in the high 20s to mid 30s. Therefore, with 18 points there is plenty of room to safely hit multiple times in an attempt to improve your total closer to 37 without busting. Drawing another card (Hit) is clearly the better choice given that every possible card will keep you under the limit at this stage. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your current total is only 21 and the threshold is 37, taking another card is statistically safe (since even the highest card, a K worth 13, would only bring you to 34) and gives you a chance to get closer to 37. In addition, knowing that the opponent’s visible card is a 2 along with three unknown cards and noticing from previous rounds that they tend to hit until reaching a moderately high total, you are at a disadvantage with 21. Therefore, by hitting you can improve your chance to get as close as possible to 37 without busting and increase your odds in the settlement round.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your current total is 33 and the threshold is 37, let’s examine the decision:\n\n• If you hit, you add a card to your 33. However, only a card of value 1–4 (i.e. A, 2, 3, or 4) will yield a safe total (34–37). Since there are 13 equally likely card types in an infinite deck, the probability of drawing a safe card is 4\/13 (about 30.8%) and around 69.2% that you’ll bust.\n\n• Standing means you lock in 33. Although 33 is not very close to 37, it avoids the high risk of busting. Your opponent’s visible card is only a 2, but their unknown cards and strategy mean they may well continue drawing; if they try to chase a higher total, they in turn risk busting. However, your extremely high bust chance on a hit (nearly 70%) makes it too dangerous to try to improve your total.\n\nThus, the conservative and strategically sound decision here is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation, your total is 33 while the threshold is 37 so you have only 4 \"points of room\" before busting. If you hit now, you will only be safe if you receive a card of value 1, 2, 3, or 4—which is roughly a 30% chance—while the remaining 70% of the card types will make you exceed 37 and lead to an immediate loss. In contrast, by standing, you keep a total of 33. Although 33 is not very close to 37, your opponent’s current behavior (having already taken extra cards on their previous moves) suggests that they might be risking bust or staying at a total not too far above 33. Given the relatively high bust risk (about 70%) if you hit, it is more reasonable to stand in order to avoid the high chance of a bust while still competing against the opponent’s likely outcome.\n\nAnswer: Stand","I recommend taking a hit.\n\nLet me explain briefly: With your current total of 21 (from 8 and K) and a bust limit of 37, any single card you draw is safe since even a King (value 13) would bring you only to 34. In order to beat your opponent—who, based on prior rounds, tends to improve his score to the high 20s or mid‐30s—you need to build your total closer to 37. With 21 you’re quite far from that “sweet spot,” and drawing one card is risk‑free. Depending on which card comes, you might even be in a position to draw again if you get a low number. Therefore, on turn 1 you should hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is 28 and you still have room to improve toward the threshold of 37. Standing now would leave you at a disadvantage, especially since your opponent tends to push toward a higher total given the threshold and their fixed strategy. Although there is roughly a 30% chance to bust if you take another card (since only cards 10, J, Q, K would break you), the potential upside of getting closer to 37 makes hitting a favorable decision. Therefore, you should choose to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Your total is 40, but the threshold N is 37 – you’ve already exceeded the threshold. Because any additional card will only increase your total further, the best (and only) option is to stand. Standing now means you accept that you’re over N, and the outcome will depend on whether the opponent also exceeds N later. In short, your move should be Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the game rules, once your cards’ total exceeds the threshold N you’re effectively “busted” (i.e. if the opponent later ends with a legal total, you lose), and you cannot improve your situation by drawing another card. In this round the threshold is 37 and your cards (8, K, 7, Q with values 8, 13, 7, 12) already add up to 40. Even though you have some remaining turns, you already exceeded 37. (Remember: hitting again will only add to a sum that’s already over the limit, and when both sides exceed N the outcome is a draw—but if the opponent does not exceed N then you lose.) \n\nBecause you already stood on turn 3 and your total is 40, your only (and best) available option is to do nothing further. In other words, you stand. \n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the board, you only have 14 while the nearer goal is 30. Drawing a card is completely safe right now (even a King with 13 would only bring you to 27). Moreover, the opponent’s starting known card is only a 5 and we can judge from earlier rounds that the dealer’s fixed strategy tends to achieve a sum near but below 30 if possible. With a low current total like 14, you should improve your hand.\n\nSo, from turn 1 of Round 6, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Let's look at the situation. The threshold N is 30 and you have three cards: 10, 4, and K (which is worth 13). That gives you a total of 27. If you choose to hit, you risk drawing a card that will push you over 30. In fact, note that to stay safe you’d have to draw a card of value 3 (or less, counting Aces as 1, 2, or 3). With the card values distributed equally from an infinite deck (each of the 13 card types having equal chance), that means only 3 out of 13 cards (about 23%) can be drawn safely. On the other hand, standing leaves you with 27. While that’s a few points shy of 30, the risk of busting (roughly 77% chance) if you hit is very high. Considering also that your opponent already took a hit in turn one—and given their fixed strategy from previous rounds—it is far more prudent to avoid risking an immediate bust. \n\nThus, the best strategy for this round is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current round, your hand totals 19 (K = 13, 6 = 6) and the threshold is 46. Since you can safely draw additional points (even with a high card like 13, your total would be at most 32, still far from 46), it is advantageous to hit in order to get closer to the threshold. Furthermore, with the opponent’s visible card being a K (13) and an unknown second card, you have no information that suggests playing it safe now. Therefore, the best move is to “hit.”\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current total of 32 and a threshold of 46, any card we receive will be safe because even if we draw the highest‐valued card (K = 13), our new total would be 45, which is still under the limit. Reviewing the previous rounds, our opponent tends to build a total that is fairly close to the threshold, sometimes reaching exactly the threshold or very near it. Standing on 32 would leave us way behind, and our winning chances would be very low given the opponent’s pattern. Therefore, it is in our best interest to request another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our game situation in Round 7, your current total is 42 and the threshold is 46. If you choose to hit, you must add the value of a new card to 42. Because card values range from 1 to 13, you would bust (i.e. exceed 46) if you draw any card with a value greater than 4. Since there are 13 equally likely outcomes, only 4 values (1, 2, 3, 4) are “safe” and 9 outcomes would lead to a bust—a bust chance of about 69%. Even if you draw safely, your new total would be 43, 44, 45, or a perfect 46; however, the high risk of busting almost certainly outweighs the potential benefit of increasing your total from 42.\n\nConsidering that your opponent (the dealer) is following an unchanging strategy and already shows a strong face‐up card (a King, which is 13), standing with 42 is the more prudent choice. By standing, you avoid the steep probability of busting and keep a reasonably competitive total in comparison to what the dealer is likely to achieve given the current moves.\n\nAnswer: Stand","I'll analyze the situation:\n\n• Your cards: K, 6, K, 10 correspond to 13, 6, 13, and 10, giving a total of 42.\n• The threshold is 46 so you’re 4 points below the limit.\n• If you hit, you must draw a card with a value of 4 or less (i.e. Ace = 1, 2, 3, or 4) in order not to exceed 46. That gives you a safe probability of 4\/13 (roughly 30.8%). In roughly 69.2% of the cases, hitting will give you a card of value 5 or higher and put you over 46, which is an immediate loss (unless the opponent also busts, which is less beneficial for you compared to not taking the risk).\n• Meanwhile, your opponent already has a K (13) showing and has taken three hits, but their full total is unknown. Their fixed strategy has so far kept their totals competitive, and standing at 42 might already force them to reach dangerously high totals in order to beat you.\n\nGiven the high bust risk if you hit and the fact that your total of 42 is reasonably close to the threshold, the optimal decision here is to play safe and Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the rules and the situation:\n\n• You currently have a total of 42 with threshold N=46. A safe hit would require that the new card’s value be small enough so that 42 + card ≤ 46—that is, only an Ace (1), 2, 3, or 4 would be “safe.” Since there are 13 card types (Ace, 2,…,10, J, Q, K) and exactly 4 of them would be safe, if you hit there is a 4⁄13 (about 31%) chance to remain under or equal to 46 and a 9⁄13 (about 69%) chance to bust immediately.\n\n• Looking at the opponent’s play in previous rounds, the opponent tends to hit aggressively until near the threshold. In this round their moves so far imply they are still taking cards to try to get closer to 46. Although your 42 is close, it may not beat an opponent that improves his total slightly, but the risk of busting by hitting is very high.\n\n• Therefore, given that hitting carries a heavy chance (nearly 70%) of busting and that standing gives you a reasonable chance to benefit from any later bust or failure from the opponent, the optimal decision is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Since our current total is only 15 and the threshold is 41, we have plenty of room to safely draw additional points without immediately risking busting. In previous rounds when our totals were too low relative to the threshold we generally improved our position by drawing another card. Moreover, the dealer’s upcard is a 3—which is low—so while their hidden card is unknown, the dealer is likely to try to build a higher total by drawing multiple cards. In order to be competitive and get closer to 41 without overshooting our own limit, the best move in this situation is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your current total is 23 and the threshold is 41, you are in a very good position to safely draw another card. Even in the worst-case scenario (drawing a King worth 13), your total would become 36, which is still well below the limit of 41. The opponent’s exact total is unknown, but since their face‐up card is a low “3” and they have not yet revealed much from their hidden cards, playing conservatively by increasing your hand total closer to the threshold improves your chances of outperforming them. Therefore, your best option in Turn 2 is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the analysis, your current total is 28 and the threshold is 41. Since any single card you draw (values 1 through 13) will result in a total at most equal to 41 (28 + 13 = 41), there’s no risk of busting. In addition, getting closer to 41 improves your chance to beat the opponent’s final total. Considering the opponent’s previous behavior and that you still have room to safely hit, the optimal play is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, your current total is 31 with a threshold of 41. By hitting, you have roughly a 10\/13 (≈77%) chance to safely improve your total (reaching between 32 and 41) and only around a 23% chance to bust. Since 31 is rather low compared to the threshold, staying would likely leave you with a weak position compared to what the opponent might eventually score. Observing the opponent’s past behavior—where they tend to hit until reaching a safer, higher total—it’s best to try to close the gap. Thus, you should choose to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is 36 while the threshold is 41. If you stand, you’re almost certainly beaten by an opponent who is likely to have at least 37. By hitting, you have a chance to safely add a card only if its value is 5 or less – this gives you a 5\/13 (≈38.5%) chance of boosting your total into 37–41 (for example, drawing a 5 makes your sum exactly 41). On the other hand, if you draw a card with value 6 or more (8\/13 chance), you bust immediately and lose this round. Although the safe chance is not high, standing on 36 hardly gives you any chance to win because the opponent’s card sequence (and past play) indicate that his final sum is very likely to be above 36.\n\nIn this situation the risk–reward calculation strongly favors taking the chance and hitting rather than standing. Therefore, following the logic and the game rules, the optimal move here is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation you’re at a total of 20 (with cards K and 7) while the threshold is 38. Since no matter what card you draw (its value ranges from 1 to 13), you won’t bust on the very first hit (because 20 + 13 = 33 which is still under 38), it is strategically sound to ask for another card in order to get closer to the threshold. Moreover, knowing your opponent’s fixed strategy from previous rounds—which seems to involve hitting until they near the threshold—you would need to improve your total from 20 closer to 38 in order to stand a chance to win. \n\nThus, the best move in this situation is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current record and the probabilities, your total is 27 while the threshold is 38. If you stand now, you risk being beaten by the opponent’s eventual total. However, if you hit, you have an 11\/13 chance of drawing a card (Ace through 10 or a Jack) that will keep you at or below the threshold. Only the Queen (12) and King (13) would cause you to bust. With about an 85% chance of a safe draw, and the need to close the gap toward 38, the optimal move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that the Threshold N is 38, your current total is 39—which already exceeds 38. In this game, if you exceed the threshold and your opponent does not, you lose automatically, and if both exceed N, the round is a draw. Because any additional card you draw on a Hit will only increase your total further (making no difference in relation to the threshold since you’re already over), your position cannot be improved by taking another card. By standing now, you lock in your 39 so that if your opponent also busts (exceeds N) on his turn, you will at least draw the round rather than lose.\n\nThus, the best move in this situation is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given that the threshold for this round is 38 and your current hand totals 39 (K=13, 7+7=14, Q=12, so 13+14+12=39), you've already exceeded N. According to the rules, once you exceed N you’re in a bust situation unless the opponent also busts, which would result in a draw. Since hitting now can only add more to your total (keeping you above N) and does not “bring you back” into safety, your best and only option is to stop taking cards so that you might still hope for a draw if your opponent also busts.\n\nTherefore, your move this turn should be: Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given the rules, the objective is to get as close to the threshold (N) as possible without exceeding it. In the current round the threshold N is 38, but your cards add up to 39 (with K = 13, 7, 7, Q = 12), meaning you have already exceeded the threshold. Once you exceed N, you cannot improve your chances by drawing another card; in fact, drawing would only add to your total further, and regardless of any additional hits you’re still “busted.” Standing now is the only option—even though you’re already over, further hits won’t reverse that situation. Your best outcome at this point is to stand and hope the opponent also exceeds N (leading to a draw) rather than staying under, which would give them the win.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current situation, you already have a total of 39 when the threshold is 38—so you’re already over the limit. Adding more cards will only increase your total further, and since any total exceeding the threshold loses (unless your opponent also exceeds, in which case the round is a draw), you can do no better by drawing another card. In this circumstance your best option is to choose Stand, in hopes that the opponent will also eventually bust. \n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation, your total is only 14 against a threshold of 37. With a margin that safe and the need to get closer to the threshold to have a competitive chance, the best move is to take an additional card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round, your total is 16 and the threshold is 37. Since the highest possible card value from the infinite deck is 13, even the worst draw (16 + 13 = 29) will not bust you. With plenty of “room” below the threshold, you gain nothing by stopping at 16. Hitting gives you a chance to get closer to 37 which is necessary for winning while there is no risk of going over. Therefore, you should take a hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I analyzed your current total of 21 and the threshold of 37. With the highest card value being 13, even the worst possible hit (a 13) would bring your total to 34, still safely under 37. In previous rounds when the threshold was 37, the opponent often ended with 37 or near it. Standing at 21 would almost certainly leave you far behind. In contrast, since you won’t risk busting on this turn by hitting, it is advantageous to continue drawing cards to get as close to 37 as possible and beat the opponent’s likely final value. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation:\n• Your total is 27—10 points away from the threshold of 37.\n• The safe cards are those valued 10 or less; drawing a card with 11, 12, or 13 would make you bust.\n• Since only 3 out of 13 types of cards would cause you to exceed the threshold (roughly a 23% chance), the probability of safely increasing your total is high.\n• Looking at previous rounds when the threshold was 37, your opponent often ended near 37. With your total at 27, standing is very unlikely to win against an opponent who can steadily accumulate a score closer to 37.\n• Therefore, even considering the risk, taking another card (Hit) gives you a much better chance to approach 37 and compete effectively.\n\nAnswer: Hit"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Given there is very little risk of busting and you have plenty of room to improve your hand, the best strategy is to request an additional card. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is only 7 while the threshold is 49. With so much room to grow, standing now would almost certainly leave you well below the target, and the uncertainty of the opponent's hidden cards suggests they might be aiming for a higher total. Additionally, the opponent has already taken a hit on their first turn. Therefore, to increase your score safely towards 49, you should request an additional card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 9 (with cards 2, 3, 2, 2) while the threshold is 49, you are very far from the limit. Since drawing another card carries minimal immediate risk of overshooting 49 (because the maximum value is 13), and given that winning requires getting as close as possible to 49 without exceeding it, the optimal move is to draw another card (i.e., Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is 17 which is far from the threshold limit of 49. There’s almost zero risk of busting by drawing another card, even if you get the highest possible card (13) which would only bring you to 30. If you stand at 17, you’re likely too far behind an opponent who is also hitting and may easily accumulate a much higher total. To maximize your chances of winning this round given the dealer’s fixed strategy, you should continue to hit until you’re much closer to 49 without exceeding it.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current total of 24 versus a threshold of 49 and the opponent’s expected accumulation (with a visible card of 2 and four additional unknowns that on average add up to roughly 28 more points), we are well below the threshold—and far behind expectation. Given the ample margin before reaching 49 and that stopping now would likely leave us losing by the difference, the strategically optimal move in this situation is to request another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your current total is 29 and the threshold is 49, you have a “buffer” of 20 points. Even in the worst‐case scenario (drawing a King valued at 13), your total would become 29 + 13 = 42, which is still safely under 49. Since the opponent’s first visible card is only a 2 and you know from the history that they have been hitting too, they appear to be chasing a higher total as well. However, with your blind margin of 20 points left you can safely improve your total without immediate bust risk.\n\nConsidering that every hit has an expected value of about 7 points (given the distribution of card values 1–13 with an equal chance each), it makes sense to try and move closer to 49. This extra draw also reduces the gap between your total and the threshold, while the opponent’s total is still uncertain. Thus, strategically you should request another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, your current total is 41 and the target is 49. With eight cards already in hand, you still have some room—provided you draw a card of 8 or less (safe cards) you will stay within the limit. Although there is roughly a 38% chance of busting with a dangerous card (values 9 and above), standing on 41 is likely too low considering that your opponent has repeatedly hit to build a higher total. The opponent’s fixed strategy (observed through six turns) suggests they will be aiming for a higher total while avoiding bust, and their one visible card of 2 does not reveal enough to be conservative.\n\nIn this situation, taking a calculated risk by hitting one more time (Turn 7) is the advisable move. This chance to move closer to 49 could secure a win, as stopping at 41 may leave you vulnerable to an opponent who continues drawing to a higher total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, you currently total 44 with a limit of 49. That’s only 5 points away from the threshold and, compared to the likely high total the opponent must have reached by stopping on turn 7, 44 is rather low. If you stand, you’re probably behind a dealer who risked several hits to get as close to 49 as possible. On the other hand, if you hit, you can improve your total—but note that if you draw any card worth more than 5 (and with an infinite deck where card values range from 1 to 13 and every card is equally likely, that’s 8 out of 13 outcomes) you’d immediately bust, yielding an automatic loss. In numbers, you have roughly a 38% chance to draw a safe card (values Ace through 5) and a 62% chance to bust.\n\nHowever, given that standing on 44 essentially hands victory to a dealer who already felt “safe” and stopped, the risk is worth it here. It’s a calculated risk: you have to try to improve your total in order to have any competitive chance. Therefore, the recommendation is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current total of 15 (from the cards 7 and 8) versus the threshold of 26 and knowing that drawing a card has only about a 15% chance to bust (only a Queen or a King, which are 12 and 13 points respectively, would cause us to exceed 26), the risk is relatively low. In contrast, our total is still far from 26 and we need a higher score to beat an opponent who, following his fixed strategy (as seen in Round 1), tends to hit several times. This makes it the optimal decision to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","The current round has a threshold of 26 and your total is 18. With a remaining “gap” of 8 points to reach 26, if you request a Hit, you have a chance to get a card that keeps you safely at or below 26 while coming closer to the target. Specifically, only cards with value 9 or higher (9, 10, J, Q, K) would make you go over 26—a probability of about 5 out of 13 if we assume an equal chance for any card value in this infinite deck. On the other hand, safe cards (Ace counted as 1, or 2–8) will improve your total, with an ideal scenario being drawing an 8 to reach exactly 26.\n\nFurthermore, since the opponent’s strategy is fixed and they have already taken one hit, they are likely trying to build toward a high total as well. Your current total of 18 does not look very competitive against a threshold of 26. To improve your chance of winning the round, it is advisable to hit and try to get closer to 26.\n\nAnswer: Hit","The situation is as follows. In the current round the threshold N is 26. Your current cards are ['7', '8', '3', 'Q'] which sum to 30—that is, you’ve already exceeded the threshold. With the rules stating that if one side exceeds N while the other does not, that side loses, your current “bust” already puts you at a significant disadvantage. There is no benefit to drawing further cards (hitting) because any additional card will only add to your total, making it even worse. Even though it might be possible that the opponent could also bust, by taking more cards you cannot reverse your own bust.\n\nTherefore, the optimal decision in this situation is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation, your current total is only 10 points while the threshold is 41. There is a large gap before you risk busting, and you need to get as close as possible to 41 to beat the opponent’s likely high accumulation. Although the opponent’s visible card (a Q valued at 12) provides a hint, their unknown card remains uncertain. Given that your total is very low relative to the threshold, it is advisable to request an additional card (Hit) in order to improve your chances in this round.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round situation, your total is just 17 out of the threshold 41 and you still have plenty of “room” before busting (even the maximum card value, 13, would bring you only to 30). In contrast, the opponent’s partly revealed hand shows a Q (worth 12) along with two unknown cards, and their fixed strategy from the previous rounds implies they keep hitting until they meet or exceed their own safe threshold. With the significant gap between your current total and the threshold, you’ll need to improve your hand by taking another card. The expected additional value of around 7 points per card means that a hit is far more beneficial at this stage, and there is little risk of busting. Therefore, the optimal move here is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round’s conditions, your total is only 21 when the threshold is 41. Since you’re allowed to hit until your total goes over 41, you have plenty of room to safely draw another card. Drawing an extra card can help you improve your total closer to 41, increasing your chances of winning against an opponent who will likely continue hitting until they reach a similar target. Therefore, the optimal decision is to take a hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current state, you have a total of 23 while the threshold is 41. Even if you were to receive the highest‐value card (a King worth 13 points), your new total would be 23 + 13 = 36, which is still safely below 41. In contrast, your opponent has only one known card (a Queen worth 12) and is following a fixed, relatively aggressive strategy that involves multiple hits. With plenty of “room” before reaching the threshold and the chance to improve your hand closer to 41, the best move is to take another card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round we have a total of 33 (with threshold 41) and an 8‐point margin before busting. Considering that a hit is safe if the drawn card is any rank from Ace (value 1) up to 8, which gives a probability of 8 out of 13 (approximately 62%), you have a good chance to improve your hand; even if the card is low, it gets you closer to 41. Given that our opponent’s fixed strategy (as seen in previous rounds) appears to be aiming for a higher total and having a high up-card (Q = 12) doesn’t prevent him from hitting further, standing with 33 seems too low. Thus, the optimal move is to request an additional card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analyzing the current situation: The threshold (N) is 41. Your cards already total 43—this means you have exceeded N. In this game, if one side exceeds N while the other does not, that side loses. Although you can’t “undo” your bust, your aim now is to try to minimize the chance of losing by hoping that your opponent also ends up over N (i.e. both bust, which results in a draw).\n\nRequesting another card (Hit) would only increase your total further, and since there is no rule allowing you to decrease your total, it cannot improve the outcome—if you hit, you will still be above 41, and if your opponent remains at or below 41, you would lose rather than potentially draw.\n\nGiven these considerations, the best move is to Stand so that you do not worsen your situation. \n\nAnswer: Stand","Given that your current total is only 20 while the threshold is 40, standing immediately would leave you far from the threshold. The opponent’s face‐up card is a 3—but with their strategy remaining unchanged and the unknown card hiding, you have little information about their final total. In previous rounds the opponent extended their total significantly (at times even exceeding the threshold), making it clear that playing conservatively by staying at 20 is not ideal.\n\nIn this situation, since the average value of a drawn card is 7, you have a good opportunity to improve your total closer to 40 without immediately busting. Thus, it is best to request another card (Hit) on the first turn.\n\nAnswer: Hit","We currently have a total of 21 (from Q = 12, 8 = 8, and A = 1) while the threshold is 40. Since every card drawn is at most 13, even the “worst‐case” addition (21 + 13 = 34) will keep you safely under the threshold. Reviewing previous rounds, we see that your opponent’s fixed strategy tends to push them well past the threshold (for example, totals of 35 when N = 26, 50 when N = 41, and 54 when N = 49). That pattern suggests that although the opponent does “hit” several times, they often end up breaking. More importantly, if you can stop with a total that is under or very near 40 while your opponent’s strategy ensures they overshoot, you would win the round (since when one party exceeds N and the other does not, the latter wins).\n\nAt your current total of 21 you are far from 40. There is no immediate risk of busting regardless of the card you draw. In order to get closer to 40 (and thus win if the opponent busts by exceeding 40), it is strategically best to request another card.\n\nSo the optimal move is to “Hit.”\n\nAnswer: Hit","We first analyze the current situation. Your total is 34, and the threshold N is 40. This means you have 6 points of “room” before you go over. In order to win you must beat your opponent. (Recall that if one side “busts” by exceeding 40 while the other does not, the non‐busted side wins.) From the previous rounds we see a pattern: both you and your opponent have been “over” N—and as a result every round ended in a draw. With a little extra care you might be able to tip the balance. \n\nYour four cards now are Q (worth 12), 8 (8), A (1) and K (13), totalling 34. If you choose to stand now you are rather far from the threshold (6 short). Meanwhile your opponent’s only known card is a 3; they have not revealed the rest of their hand, but the records show that with their fixed strategy they also tend to “overshoot” (and thus typically bust) by a small margin. Even if the opponent is playing blindly on the current round, if you stay at 34 there is a high chance they will end with a safe (non‐busted) total that is closer to 40 and win the round.\n\nOn the other hand, if you “hit” you are risking a bust: Only cards with values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 are “safe” (i.e. they will not push you over 40) because 34 plus any of those gives you between 35 and exactly 40. There are 6 safe types of cards out of 13 possible values (Ace = 1, 2–6 are safe) so the probability of drawing a safe card is about 6⁄13 – roughly 46%. If you do draw one and get closer to 40, you will be in a much stronger position, because then even if your opponent does not bust, you are more likely to be closer to the threshold. \n\nThus, though the risk of busting in this turn is slightly over 50%, the potential benefit of moving your total from 34 closer to 40 (and possibly even hitting 40 exactly) makes the “hit” decision preferable to “stand” in this case.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\nWe note that the threshold in this round is 40 and your current hand consists of ['Q', '8', 'A', 'K', 'K'] with a total of 47, which is already above 40. According to the rules, if you exceed the threshold while your opponent does not, you lose. However, if both sides exceed the threshold, the round is declared a draw.\n\nFrom the record of previous rounds, your opponent’s fixed strategy has always led to them eventually exceeding the threshold too. That is, although the opponent’s first card is visible (a 3), during previous rounds they continued to hit such that their totals were also above the threshold. Given that, if you choose to Stand now with 47, and your opponent follows their strategy, both scores will be over 40 and the outcome will be a draw.\n\nMoreover, hitting now would only add more points and keep your total over the threshold, leaving the situation unchanged (both being bust results in a draw regardless of how far over the threshold you go). Thus, the optimal move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation, your hand already totals 47 which is above the threshold of 40. No matter what card you draw next, your total will only rise further—a hit cannot lower your score back to or below 40. Since if you’re already over while your opponent is still drawing (and will eventually be over if they follow their fixed strategy) the best you can hope for is a draw. In contrast, if you add another card, you’ll just be further from 40 relative to the opponent (if by some stroke they finish under threshold, they win outright). Thus, there is no benefit to taking an additional card.\n\nIt is optimal for you to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on our current round – we have a very low total (4 points) compared to the threshold (35) and the dealer’s visible card (“K” worth 13 points) – we almost certainly have room to take extra cards without immediate risk of busting. In the rounds played so far the opponent (dealer) has followed a fixed pattern that makes them hit repeatedly until they exceed the threshold. Even though that often ends with both sides busting (which would be a draw), having a very low score gives us ample room to build a competitive total (ideally near 35 without busting) where, if the opponent busts or ends up further from 35, we win the round.\n\nGiven that we start with only 4, standing now would almost always be a losing proposition. Therefore, our best move is to “Hit” – take another card in attempt to safely build our total closer to 35.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your current total (6) is very far from the threshold (35) and you have plenty of room to improve without the risk of busting, you need to build a total that can beat the opponent’s likely sum. In previous rounds the opponent has been hitting consistently until reaching a relatively high total, and his face-up card ‘K’ (value 13) suggests his overall total might be high. Standing now with 6 would almost certainly lose unless the opponent busts—which is unlikely given their prior strategy. Therefore, you should take an additional card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round the threshold is 35 and your total is only 9. With such a low total, there is plenty of room (up to 26 points) before you risk going over the threshold. In all previous rounds the final totals ended up well above the threshold (resulting in draws), so it appears that both sides tend to hit aggressively. However, given that you are very far from 35 already, standing now would leave you extremely far from the target and most likely give the opponent the advantage when they complete their turns. By hitting you can safely improve your total and get closer to 35, increasing the chance that if the opponent busts (or ends with a number closer but still over 35) you may win by comparison.\n\nThus, your best move in this situation is to ask for an additional card – Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that the board’s threshold is 35 and your current total is 22, you have a margin of 13 points. Since every card’s value is between 1 (ace) and 13 (K is 13), no matter what card you draw next you cannot go over 35 on this turn. It is therefore risk‐free to hit because even a “worst” draw (a K worth 13) would bring you exactly to 35—the maximum without busting.\n\nAlso, consider that your opponent’s behavior in prior rounds shows they tend to continue hitting until later and may stop at a higher total. With your current total at just 22, you are far from the threshold and likely at a disadvantage if you stand now. Improving your position by hitting (i.e. receiving at least one additional card) gives you a good chance to get closer to 35 and beat the opponent’s eventual total.\n\nThus, the optimal move based on the board state and rules is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is exactly 35 which is the threshold. Any additional card will push your total above 35 and cause a bust. Since hitting guarantees exceeding the threshold, your best move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given that your current total is only 20 (from Q = 12 and 8), while the threshold is 44, you are very far from 44. Moreover, because every card is between 1 and 13, hitting from 20 is “risk‐free” in the sense that even the worst possible card (13) will bring you to only 33 (20 + 13), which is safely under the threshold. In contrast, your opponent’s known card is an Ace (value 1) and their hidden card is unknown; statistically, the opponent’s starting total is likely very low and – based on previous rounds – your opponent tends to hit repeatedly and often overshoots the threshold when trying to get closer to it.\n\nSince you want to be as close as possible to 44 without going over, and because you are currently at 20, it is optimal to request a hit now. By doing so, you both remain safe and also increase your chance to eventually reach a total closer to 44 than your opponent, who appears to overdraw.\n\nThus, according to the game board and rules, your best move at this turn is: Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your current sum is 32 with a threshold of 44, there is room to improve your hand without a high risk of busting. A safe hit means you can draw any card up to 12 (only a King, with value 13, would cause you to go over), and since cards come uniformly from an infinite deck, the bust risk is low (about 7.7%). Furthermore, by taking another card you have a chance to get closer to 44, which is important since settlement is based on who is closer to the threshold and your opponent’s strategy seems to be to hit until they near (or exceed) the threshold too. Standing on 32 would likely leave you behind if the opponent manages to get a higher safe total. \n\nThus, under the circumstances and with the historical data suggesting that the opponent often pushes their hits (even sometimes fouling up), the optimal move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the analysis, here’s our reasoning:\n\nWe are on Round 6 with a threshold N = 44. Your current cards are [Q, 8, Q, 3] which add up to 35. This means you are 9 points away from 44. The rule is that if you “hit” and get a card whose value is 9 or less, you won’t bust (since 35 + (card value) ≤ 44). A hit with a value of 10 or more would immediately put you over 44 and count as a bust.\n\nFrom the deck there are 13 equally possible card values (Ace=1, 2…10, J=11, Q=12, K=13). The safe cards for you would be those with values in the range 1 through 9 (a total of 9 possibilities) while the remaining four values (10, 11, 12, 13) would bust you. This gives you a roughly 9\/13 (≈69%) chance of drawing a safe card. \n\nIn addition, looking at the history, your opponent (whose further draws are still unknown) seems fixed in strategy that often leads him to overshoot or “bust” by going over the threshold. Your current total of 35 isn’t competitive if you stop now, because the opponent is likely to draw more cards and get closer to 44 (or even go over, which still causes a draw if you’re also over) but your win is based on having the better total relative to the threshold. \n\nThus, your best chance is to “hit” in order to move closer to 44 (ideally reaching exactly 44 or high in the safe range) while accepting a moderate risk of busting (about 30%). The expected benefit of improving your total outweighs the risk since standing at 35 is unlikely to be good enough given the opponent’s behavior in previous rounds.\n\nSo, the recommendation is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current round situation, we observe that our own total is 47 while the threshold N is 44. According to the game rules, if one side’s total is above the threshold and the other’s isn’t, the non‑exceeding side wins; if both exceed the threshold, it’s a draw. In previous rounds we have seen that when both sides have gone over N the game ends in a draw, which is preferable to a loss.\n\nSince our total is already above 44, taking another card (Hit) cannot “rescue” us because any additional card only increases our total further; we remain over the threshold in every case. By standing now we keep our total at 47, and our only hope is that our opponent, who has begun with an Ace and several unknown cards, will also eventually exceed 44—leading to at worst a draw. Given that our hit won’t help us get under or equal to the threshold, and it might even call for extra moves from the opponent without any improvement on our outcome, the optimal decision in this situation is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the rules, once a total goes above the threshold N a player has “busted” (exceeded N) so that even drawing more cards won’t bring you any closer to winning. In this round N is 44 and your cards give you a total of 47—which is already over the limit. Whether you choose to hit and add another positive card (making your total even farther above 44) or stand (keeping your total at 47), you remain busted. Because the only outcome that can help you when you’ve exceeded N is if your opponent also busts (which would only yield a draw), there is no benefit to drawing another card. Therefore, the best decision is to stand. \n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on our hand, we already have 47, which is above the round threshold of 44. According to the rules, if one side exceeds N and the other stays at or below N then that lower total wins; if both exceed N then the result is a draw. In our case, whether we hit or stand, we’re already over—so if the opponent eventually busts we get a draw, but if they do not bust they win regardless. Adding another card (hitting) would only increase our total further into the “bust” territory without affecting the settlement rule when both sides are over the threshold. Therefore, there is no advantage to taking another card, and the optimal move is to simply stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current situation, your total is 47, which is already above the threshold N of 44. Since taking another card only adds points (and you cannot lower your current sum), there’s no benefit to hitting. Remember, if you exceed N and your opponent does not, you lose; if both bust then it’s a draw. In your current case, improving your outcome isn’t possible by drawing more cards, so the best you can do is to stand and hope that your opponent also busts (leading to a draw) rather than staying below N (in which case you’d lose).\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given you currently have only 18 points and the threshold is 41, you’re very far from reaching a competitive total in this round. In previous rounds, the opponent’s fixed strategy led them to hit repeatedly to get close to the threshold (even if that sometimes resulted in exceeding the limit). With your total at 18, the safe margin is 23 points. Drawing another card—even though there’s risk (since card values range up to 13)—is statistically favorable because the average card value is about 7. Standing now would almost certainly leave you well behind if your opponent plays their known strategy.\n\nTherefore, to maximize your chance of reaching a competitive total without an immediate risk of busting, you should choose to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, you have a total of 24 while the threshold is 41. Because even the highest possible drawn card (King = 13) would bring you to 37 (24 + 13 = 37) without busting, you still have room to improve your total toward 41. Also, judging from our history, the opponent generally ends up with a total that busts or overshoots the threshold after multiple hits by their fixed strategy. Thus, to be competitive you need to risk another card in order to approach 41 as closely as possible. In short, your best move on turn 2 in this round is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is 28 and the threshold is 41 so you have a “safe” gap of 13. Since every card in this game is between 1 and 13 points (with a King giving exactly 13 to reach 41), any additional card will not bust you immediately. Given that your opponent already has three cards (with one face‐up 8) and is following a fixed hitting strategy, it’s highly likely that their total will be higher than your 28 by the end of the round if you stand now. In order to remain competitive and work toward a total as close as possible to 41, you should take another card (Hit) on Turn 3.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the rules and our current hand, our total is 37 and the threshold N is 41. If we “hit,” we can only safely add a card worth 1–4 (i.e. Ace, 2, 3, or 4) because if the drawn card is 5 or more our total would exceed 41. Since each of the 13 card values is equally likely (about a 4⁄13 chance of drawing a safe card versus a 9⁄13 chance of busting), the risk of busting is very high if we request an additional card.\n\nIn contrast, standing with a total of 37 avoids that high bust risk. Although 37 isn’t as close to 41 as we might like, the possibility of improvement (a hit) comes at a prohibitive risk of bust. Reviewing our previous rounds shows that when both sides end up busting it results in a draw (only 0.5 score), and our opponent’s visible card (an 8) with their fixed strategy doesn’t give us a compelling reason to take a risky hit.\n\nTherefore, the optimal decision on turn 4 is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given that your current total is only 17 and the round’s threshold is 26, you’re far from the goal of getting as close to 26 as possible without busting. You must consider that if you stand now, it’s very likely your opponent—whose fixed strategy leads them to keep hitting until they approach or exceed 26—will easily beat your 17. On the other hand, if you hit, the safe outcome is drawing any card whose value is 9 or less (since 17 + 9 = 26), and even though there is a risk of busting if you draw a 10 or a face card, there are 9 safe outcomes out of 13 possible card types (each card type being equally likely from an infinite deck). This gives approximately a 69% chance of drawing a safe card. Given the unfavorable position if you stand, the odds favor playing it safe by taking at least one more card to improve your total without busting. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation:\n\n• Your cards are 9, 8, 7, totaling 24.  \n• The threshold is 26, so if you hit, you must draw a very low card (only an Ace [value 1] or a 2) to avoid busting. With an infinite deck assumed to have equal chances for each of the 13 ranks, only 2 out of 13 cards (about 15%) will leave you safe.  \n• Standing on 24 means you won’t bust. Although your total is 2 points away from 26, the risk of drawing a card that pushes you over is very high.  \n• Considering your opponent’s fixed strategy and the risk factors, it is optimal to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","I analyzed your current hand of 10 and 7 (totaling 17) versus the opponent’s visible 5, under a threshold of 33. Since 17 is far from 33 and every card in this infinite deck adds at most 13 (thus 17+13=30, which is still safely under the threshold), it makes sense to draw an extra card. The expected value of a new card is roughly 7, which would give you about 24—quite an improvement. This gives you more room to play in later turns while still remaining safe. Therefore, I recommend taking a Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, you currently have a total of 24 with a threshold of 33. That means you need to add at most 9 more points without busting. Since hitting gives roughly a 9\/13 chance (about 69%) of drawing a safe card (values 1–9) and improving your total to anywhere between 25 and the ideal 33, and since standing with 24 is quite far from the threshold when your opponent is also trying to improve, the optimal move is to take the risk and hit in order to get closer to 33.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is 25 while the threshold is 33. With an infinite deck where drawing a card yields one of 13 possible outcomes (Ace=1, numbers 2–10, and face cards with values 11, 12, 13), you have 8 safe outcomes (drawing a card with value 1 through 8) which would bring your total to a figure between 26 and 33. However, there are 5 outcomes (drawing a 9, 10, J, Q, or K) that would push your total over 33 and cause you to bust immediately.\n\nAt 25, you are 8 points below the threshold. If you choose to stand at 25, you are quite far from 33, and—as seen from previous rounds—the opponent’s strategy typically enables them to move closer to 33 without busting. On the other hand, a hit gives you roughly a 61.5% chance (8 out of 13) of safely increasing your total. With a safe draw, you might end up with totals anywhere from 26 up to a perfect 33. In addition, even if you don’t get 33 immediately, having a higher total than 25 increases your chances of winning unless the risk leads to bust. \n\nConsidering that the risk of busting (approximately 38.5%) might be worth taking in order to be competitive with an opponent whose unknown cards (beyond the visible \"5\") could allow them to hit near the threshold, the optimal move in this scenario is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, you have a total of 26 and need to reach as close as possible to 33 without going over. With 26 you’re 7 points below the threshold. Drawing one more card gives you about a 7 in 13 chance (roughly 54%) to get a card whose value is 7 or less (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7) and safely improve your total. In contrast, there’s a 6 in 13 chance (about 46%) that you draw a higher card (8 or above), which would put you over 33. \n\nMoreover, given that the opponent’s move history shows that they have already chosen to stand (in turn 3 this round) and that their face‐up card is only a 5, there’s a good chance their final total won’t be “magically” superior to yours if you can safely approach 33. On the other hand, staying at 26 leaves you with a 7-point gap from the threshold—quite a disadvantage if the opponent’s unexposed cards work in their favor.\n\nBalancing the risk of busting (≈46%) against the potential of significantly improving your hand (up to a perfect 33 if you get a 7) and knowing that 26 is rather weak relative to 33, the recommended move is to take one more card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation let’s analyze our options:\n\n• Our current total is 28 and the game threshold is 33. This means we have room for at most an extra 5 points before busting. If we choose to hit, only cards valued 5 or less (Ace being 1, plus 2, 3, 4, 5) are “safe.” Out of the 13 card types, that gives a probability of about 5\/13 (roughly 38.5%) to remain under the threshold. The other 8 out of 13 cards mean immediate bust—about 61.5% risk.\n\n• If we get a safe card the new totals would be:\n  – 1 → 29\n  – 2 → 30\n  – 3 → 31\n  – 4 → 32\n  – 5 → 33 (perfect hit on the threshold)\n So even in the best safe outcome we only improve gradually.\n\n• Looking at our opponent’s play in this round, they already drew 4 cards (their known card is 5 and three are unknown) and ended their hits by turn 4. Their behavior in previous rounds suggests they tend to stop once they are near what they feel is “safe” (and their average likely falls in the mid-to-high 20’s given an average card value of 7 if drawn randomly). Standing at 28 gives us a relatively safe position—if the opponent busts or ends up with a lower total, we win. Even if the opponent has a hit and ends with a closer number (say 29–33), our risk by trying to improve from 28 is high with over 60% chance to bust.\n\nIn summary, hitting at a total of 28 under a threshold of 33 carries high risk (a majority chance to bust) with only modest potential improvement. Standing with 28 appears to be the safer and more optimal move in light of the opponent’s apparent strategy.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current board, your total is 8 while the threshold is only 28. Since no card in our infinite deck can add more than 13 points, there’s no risk of busting on a hit—8 plus any card (even a King for 13 points) reaches at most 21, still well below 28. In contrast, the opponent’s only visible card is a 7 while the hidden card could be high, meaning it’s unclear how high their starting total is. Because you have a very low total, you need to build toward a higher sum (closer to 28) to eventually beat the opponent’s total. In summary, you’re in no danger when hitting at this point, and it is best to request an additional card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current total of 18 (with A = 1, so 1 + 7 + 10 = 18) and given that we have a safe margin of 10 points up to the threshold of 28, hitting is advisable. In an infinite deck with 13 equally likely ranks, 10 out of 13 card values (Ace through 10) will keep us safe, while only 3 (J = 11, Q = 12, K = 13) would cause a bust. This gives us roughly a 77% chance to improve our total toward 28 without going over. Considering that our opponent’s strategy (shown by the previous round moves) tends to push toward a higher total and our starting 18 is quite behind, taking a hit is the best move in this situation.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current hand of A, 7, 10, 7 (totaling 25) and knowing the threshold is 28, if you hit you risk busting on any card valued 4 or more. Since there are only three card types (Ace, 2, or 3) that are “safe” – and those make up roughly 3\/13 of the card types – the chance of drawing a safe card is less than one‐in‐four. This significant risk of busting outweighs the potential benefit of reaching a higher total, especially when you already have a relatively high total and the opponent still does not know your complete picture. Therefore, the optimal decision is to stop (Stand).\n\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Even if you draw the highest possible value (which is 13), your total would only reach 32, which is still safely below 43. By taking another card you improve your chances of coming closer to 43 and beating your opponent’s potential total later. Therefore, the optimal move in this situation is to choose Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current game situation you’re at 30 points while the threshold is 43, which leaves you a safe margin of 13 points. Since every card in the deck has a value between 1 and 13, you cannot bust (exceed 43) by taking one more card. Meanwhile, standing on 30 is quite far from the target 43 and likely less competitive compared to the opponent’s unknown total. Therefore, the best move is to take another hit in hopes of getting closer to 43 without going over.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, your total is 36 out of 43. Since you’re 7 points away and you risk busting only if you draw a card with a value 8 or higher (which is 6 out of the 13 possible card values, about 46% chance), you have roughly a 54% chance to improve your total without busting. Because a total of 36 is rather far from 43—and the opponent has already taken hits—you should try to get closer to N by taking another card.\n\nTherefore, the best decision in this scenario is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, your current total is 38 while the threshold is 43. If you hit, only a card with a value of 1 through 5 will keep you safe. Since there are 13 equally possible cards (with values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13), only 5 out of 13 cards (roughly 38.5%) will not bust you. That means there is about a 61.5% chance you bust if you hit. With a 38 total, you are already quite close to the limit, and the risk of busting is high.\n\nAlso note that your opponent has already hit three times. Although you don’t know their exact total, their strategy is fixed and they still have unknown cards. In this situation, improving your score further by risking a hit is likely not optimal when compared to the risk of busting. Therefore, it is better to play conservatively and stand with the current total.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the rules and the current situation, here’s the reasoning:\n\n• You have five cards totaling 38 points and must remain at or below the threshold 43. Since drawing another card (Hit) risks busting (only cards with values 1–5 are “safe” – a roughly 5 in 13 chance), you already have a fairly safe total.\n• The move history shows that on Turn 4 you chose Stand while your opponent kept hitting. That is, you have already stopped taking cards.\n• Given that hitting now would have only about a 38% chance to improve your total without busting and would nearly always leave you with a total that is still under 43 (and only a perfect draw of 5 would get you exactly 43), it is better in this situation to simply stick with your current total.\n• In addition, since your opponent is still taking cards (and his fixed strategy is unknown but already leans toward taking more risks), you get more by letting him risk busting than risking your safe total unnecessarily.\n\nTherefore, you should remain hidden behind your earlier decision and Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given that your current total is 38 and the maximum allowed is 43, any additional card you take (a Hit) is safe only if its value is 5 or less. Since the deck contains 13 possible card values (with Ace=1, numbers 2–10, and face cards J=11, Q=12, K=13), only 5 out of 13 cards (namely, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5) will keep your total at or below 43. That gives you roughly a 38.5% chance of staying in the game and a 61.5% chance of busting if you hit.\n\nThe opponent’s records show that they've already taken multiple cards (their first face-up card is an 8 plus six unknown cards from previous turns), and their play has consisted solely of hitting so far. Since your opponent will continue drawing cards using their fixed strategy, you don’t have control over their outcome—but by risking a bust, you could be giving them an even better chance to win. In contrast, standing at 38 keeps you safely below the threshold and forces the opponent to try to close the gap without busting.\n\nGiven the high bust risk from drawing another card combined with your moderate total relative to the threshold, the optimal decision is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on our analysis of past rounds and the current state, our total is only 13 while the threshold is 46. Standing now would leave us very far from 46 and give the opponent (who always seems to keep hitting even past our stands) a significant advantage. Since every card has a value from 1 to 13 and our margin (46 − 13 = 33) is large enough that one card will never cause an immediate bust, it is clearly optimal to ask for another card.\n\nTherefore, the best move on the first turn of this round is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current state you’re far from the threshold (only 14 versus 46) and with knowledge that your opponent’s fixed strategy led them to continue hitting (even to the point of busting in a previous round), you should try to build a stronger hand. At this point the best move is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, your current total is only 19 while the threshold is 46. To be competitive and close to the target without easily busting (since cards values are relatively low early on), it’s best to request another card. Given the opponent’s fixed strategy (which has been demonstrated to hit multiple times regardless), standing at 19 is far off from the threshold. Hitting improves your chances of reaching a competitive total before the dealer accrues too high a score.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 27 with a threshold of 46 and knowing that even the highest card (King = 13) added to your current sum would be 27 + 13 = 40 (still under 46), you are in a very safe zone to hit. Also, considering the opponent's apparent fixed strategy (observed from Round 1) where they always hit regardless, you benefit from working to get as close as possible to the threshold. Therefore, in Turn 4 it is advisable to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given you currently have a total of 34 and the threshold is 46, you have room to improve your hand. Since every card other than a King (which is 13) adds safely (i.e. Ace through Queen give values up to 12) without busting, there is roughly a 12\/13 chance (about 92% probability) that an extra card will be safe. Considering that your opponent appears to follow a “hit until…?” strategy (as seen in Round 1) and that you need to get closer to the threshold in order to beat the expected total of your opponent, it’s beneficial to ask for another card. \n\nThus, based on the rules and your current total of 34 against a threshold of 46, your optimal move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, here’s the reasoning:\n\n• You currently have 41 and the limit is 46. If you hit you can only add a card of 5 or less safely (because 41+6 would be 47 and bust); that gives you only a 5⁄13 (≈38.5%) chance to remain in play, while there’s a 8⁄13 (≈61.5%) chance to bust immediately.\n\n• Although “improving” your total to 42–46 would put you closer to the threshold and, in an ideal world, give you an edge, forcing a hit comes with a high risk. Your opponent’s fixed aggressive strategy (as seen in Round 1) indicates that they are likely to keep drawing even if it means being dangerously close to (or over) the limit. In the previous round, the opponent overstepped when their target (N) was lower; now that the threshold is 46, they have more room but will probably still be taking additional cards on their turn.\n\n• With your current 41, you are relatively safe if you play conservatively. Standing at 41 means you do not risk an immediate bust. While your total isn’t extremely high, the high bust probability from trying to get closer to 46 outweighs the potential upside of hitting, especially given your full knowledge of the previous round and the opponent’s aggressive tendencies.\n\nThus, the best move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on our analysis, our current total is 15 (3 + Q, where Q counts as 12) and the round’s threshold is only 30. Since the maximum card value is 13, even a hit cannot put us over 30 on the first additional card (15 + 13 = 28). In contrast, the opponent’s visible card is K (worth 13), with an unknown hidden card that gives him a starting total between 14 and 26. Given these facts, our best chance to get closer to 30 than the opponent is to safely accumulate extra points. It is therefore optimal to request an additional card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation you have a total of 20 with a headroom of 10 points before hitting the threshold of 30. Because the card values range from 1 up to 13—with the safe cards being ones with a value of 10 or less—the probability of drawing a card without busting is 10\/13 (roughly 77%). Although there is a risk (about 23%) of busting if you draw an 11, 12, or 13, the likelihood of safely getting closer to 30 (possibly even reaching exactly 30) is very attractive when you compare it against standing at 20.\n\nMoreover, the opponent already has one high card (a “K” = 13) and additional unknown cards; given that their fixed strategy tends to hit repeatedly, they’re likely building a total that may be dangerous if they don’t bust themselves. However, your current total of 20 is relatively low compared to the threshold of 30 and may not be competitive if the opponent reaches closer to 30 with safe hits. Hence, increasing your total by taking one more card gives you a better chance to beat the opponent even if you risk busting.\n\nTherefore, the recommended move in this situation is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the board we have, here’s the reasoning. Our round‐3 threshold is 30 and our current total is 22. If we stand, we’re 8 points shy of the limit and risk being beaten by an opponent who—according to his fixed pattern in previous rounds—keeps “hitting” aggressively even with a decent starting card (his face‐up card is K = 13). Moreover, since the opponent’s strategy didn’t change in previous rounds (where his seemingly overhitting approach led him to exceed the threshold), it is likely he will continue to be aggressive now. With our score at 22, even if the dealer busts sometimes, our current total is too low to compete when the dealer does manage to stop safely (or get close to 30).\n\nIf we “hit,” however, we have a chance to improve our total closer to the limit. In our situation a hit is “safe” if the drawn card is no higher than 8 (since 30 – 22 = 8). There are 8 out of the 13 card values (Ace = 1, then 2 through 8) that won’t bust us immediately. That means there’s roughly a 61.5% chance (8\/13) for a safe improvement. Improving our total (for example, drawing an 8 to reach exactly 30 or drawing a 7 to get 29) makes our total considerably more competitive against an aggressive opponent prone to overshooting. Of course, there is around a 38.5% chance that we’d bust immediately if we draw a card with value 9 or above.\n\nBalancing our “8 points improvement” potential against the risk to bust, it seems advisable to try to edge closer to the threshold rather than stand stuck at 22. Given that the opponent’s own cards are already in a high range (starting with 13 from the K) and that his fixed (and aggressive) action in the past rounds caused him to bust when the thresholds were higher, we have an incentive to push our total closer to 30 in this low-threshold round.\n\nThus, the recommended move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 27 and the threshold of 30, you only have a 3-in-13 chance (for an Ace, 2, or 3) of drawing a card that would leave you at or below 30. This means there is roughly a 77% risk of busting if you hit. Additionally, although your opponent’s future draws are uncertain, you already have a very narrow margin to work with. Given the high risk of immediately going over the threshold and the potentially small advantage even if you improved by one or two points, it is best to avoid further risk.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on our analysis of the history and the opponent’s “fixed” behavior (which in every previous round led them to take extra cards until they eventually passed the threshold), we can deduce that their strategy forces them to “bust” (end with a total above N). In Round‐4 the threshold is 50, and their two starting cards (a 4 and a hidden card between 1 and 13) are very low compared to 50 so they must draw repeatedly until they first pass 50. That means no matter how lucky their draws are, they will always “exceed N.”\n\nOn the other hand, you currently have 20 (8 + Q, with Q = 12) and so you are safely under N. According to the rules, if one side “exceeds N” and the other stays at or below N, the safe side wins. Even if you “stand” immediately with 20, the opponent’s forced draws (based on their fixed strategy) will take them above 50. (It is not worth risking additional hits and the possibility of accidentally busting yourself—if you hit and go over 50, then if the opponent already busted you’d only get a draw rather than a win.)\n\nTherefore, the best move is to simply Stand right now with your total of 20, which assures that you remain under the threshold while the opponent (forced to draw) will certainly “exceed N.”\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given that your total is currently 20 and the threshold (N) is 50, you have plenty of room to improve your hand without immediately risking a bust. In the previous rounds the opponent often ended up drawing many cards and frequently exceeded their threshold by only a small margin. Standing now with 20 would leave you very far from 50, and the opponent’s strategy of accumulating points might allow them to get much closer to N without busting—or even force them into a bust if they push too far. \n\nSince you have a large margin (20 + any card drawn from an infinite deck with maximum value 13 still remains safely under 50), the risk of busting in your immediate next hit is nonexistent. The optimal strategy here is to take another card (Hit) in order to accumulate more points and have a better chance of beating your opponent in terms of closeness to the threshold—or to force them into overshooting N.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round the situation is as follows:\n• The threshold is 50, meaning you have considerable “head‐room” to approach that target.\n• You currently total 20 with your cards “8” and “Q”. Given that busting only occurs if you exceed 50, you are far from the limit.\n• Meanwhile the opponent’s known card is “4” (plus three unknown cards) and his previous moves indicate he will likely continue “hitting” until his total is closer to the threshold—even if that means risking an overshoot.\n• Since being closer to 50 wins when both sides remain under or not excessively over the threshold, you need to try to improve your hand considerably.\n• With such a low total (20 compared to the potential range up to 50), the mathematically and strategically better decision is to “hit” in order to accumulate more points and be competitive against an opponent who is clearly not stopping soon.\n\nTherefore, your best move on Turn 3 is to request another card—that is, choose to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the information provided, your current total is 20 (with an 8 and a Q, where Q = 12). The threshold N for this round is 50, and you want to be as close as possible to 50 without exceeding it. Although your opponent’s exact cards (beyond the initial 4) are unknown, the typical goal is to reach as high as possible while remaining under N. With a total of 20, you are far from the upper limit and have a significant margin before risking a bust (even a K, valued at 13, would only bring you to 33). Given that your opponent has already hit several times and is likely pursuing a similar high-total strategy, you should take advantage of your safety margin. \n\nTherefore, the best move in this situation is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation you have a total of 20 points while the round’s threshold is 50. The opponent’s visible card is low (a 4) and his past rounds show that his fixed strategy tends to have him keep hitting aggressively even if it sometimes gives him an excess total. With a low total of 20 and plenty of headroom before reaching 50 (even if you draw a card with value 13, you’d only reach 33), it is in your best interest to continue improving your score.\n\nSince your aim is to get as close to 50 as possible without busting—and given that an opponent following his fixed, hit-heavy strategy will likely improve his total too (and run the risk of busting, but that doesn’t favor you if you remain too low)—choosing another hit gives you a chance to safely raise your total while pressuring him.\n\nThus, you should opt to Hit next.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation and using our records from the previous rounds, our hand is quite low (20 versus a threshold of 50). Considering that drawing another card—even if it is as high as a King (13 points)—won’t bust us (20 + 13 = 33, still safe), we should try to get closer to 50. Meanwhile, our opponent already has received many cards and appears to be following a fixed “hit‐until—” strategy that might bring them closer to the threshold. With our total at only 20, the best chance to win is to ask for another card, so the optimal move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation you have only 20 points while the threshold is 50. The worst card you can draw is a 13 (for a King) so even in the worst case your total would become 33, which is still safe relative to 50. Therefore, it is reasonable to ask for another card (Hit) to try to get closer to the threshold.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round, your total is 24 and the threshold is only 26. If you hit, you run an 11\/13 chance (approximately 85%) of drawing a card whose value is 3 or more, which would take you over 26 and cause an immediate bust. Only drawing an Ace (value 1) or a 2 (value 2) keeps you safe—and even then you’d only have 25 or hit the exact threshold of 26. Reviewing the previous rounds, your opponent’s fixed strategy led him into overshooting his thresholds, even when the numbers were much higher. With the threshold as low as 26, it is highly likely that he will run into his own bust after multiple cards. \n\nGiven that standing with 24 keeps you safely under the threshold and leaves your opponent to try to improve over a very narrow margin (likely overshooting), the best move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on our situation, our two cards add up to 24 with a threshold of 26. If we hit, almost all card values (3 through 13) would make us exceed 26, with only drawing an Ace (1) or 2 giving us totals of 25 or 26 respectively. That means there’s roughly a 15% chance of safely improving our hand and an 85% chance of busting instantly. On the other hand, standing at 24 leaves us with a chance to win if our opponent busts or ends up with a total less than 24. Given that the opponent is following a fixed strategy (and based on previous rounds, they seem to take risks that sometimes lead to busts under low thresholds), taking a hit now carries a high risk with only a small chance of benefit. Therefore, it is best to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given that our total is 24 against a low target of 26, any additional card (except for drawing an Ace worth 1 or a “2”) would push us over the limit. In an infinite deck with 13 equally likely card values, only 2 out of 13 cards (Ace and 2) would keep us safe—a probability of roughly 15%—leaving an 85% chance to bust. Moreover, even if the opponent hasn't revealed all their cards, their hit strategy appears to be quite aggressive, but with a low threshold like 26 they too must be cautious. With our current strong total of 24, taking the hit is far too risky. Therefore, the optimal move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current round the threshold is 40 and your total is only 11 (from a 7 and a 4). With so much room before reaching 40, there is virtually no danger of going over even if you add a card with the highest value (13 points) because 11 + 13 = 24, which is still well below the threshold. Meanwhile, the opponent’s only visible card is an 8 and their behavior in previous rounds shows that they tend to keep hitting dangerously close to or over N. With that in mind, you want to build your hand to a much higher total to beat the opponent (or force them to bust) while staying safely under the threshold. This makes \"hit\" the best move here.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current total of 13 (well below the threshold of 40) and the observed pattern from previous rounds where taking extra cards kept our total safely below N while the opponent’s fixed strategy often resulted in overshooting (even though we can’t see his hidden cards), the best decision now is to risk another card. In short, we should hit on turn 2.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your current total is 26 with a threshold of 40, note that any single card drawn (ranging from 1 up to 13) can be safely added without immediately exceeding 40 (26 + 13 = 39). Since you still have ample room to improve your hand without busting immediately, and you want to be as close to 40 as possible (because in this game the side closer to the threshold wins if both do not bust), it is best to take another card. \n\nBased on the history, your opponent tends to keep hitting and usually ends up overshooting the threshold. Therefore, safely increasing your total gives you a better chance of winning provided you stop before reaching 40. \n\nFinal decision: Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current total of 30 (with a safe gap of 10 to the threshold 40) and the fact that only drawing a card worth 11 or more (J, Q, K) would push us over 40 – which happens about 3⁄13 of the time – the probability of busting on our next hit is roughly 23%. In contrast, drawing any of the other 10 ranks gives us a better chance to approach 40. In addition, from the history we see our opponent tends to hit aggressively and often ends up exceeding the threshold. By trying to get closer to 40 (or even exactly hit 40) we improve our chance of winning (or at worst forcing a draw) when the opponent takes their next hits and risks busting. \n\nTherefore, it is optimal to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the history and the opponent’s observed pattern, continuing to hit when your total is already 35 under a threshold of 40 is very risky. With a hit, you need a card with value 1–5 to avoid busting (only 5 out of 13 cards give a safe outcome), which is roughly a 38.5% chance. Given that in past rounds your opponent’s actions have often ended up over the threshold (busting) and that he has now ended his card-taking by standing, it is advantageous to keep your safe 35 rather than risk busting. Therefore, the optimal move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on our current situation, our hand totals only 22 (from the cards \"10\" and \"Q\" having values 10 and 12), which is well below the threshold of 43. This means that if we take another card (Hit), there is no risk of immediately busting since even the highest‐value card (a King worth 13) would bring our total to only 35 (22 + 13). Meanwhile, history shows that our opponent tends to hit aggressively—even if that sometimes causes them to go over the threshold. It would be advantageous for us to improve our total to get closer to 43 to increase our likelihood of winning the round. \n\nTherefore, the best move in this scenario is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, your total is 29 and the threshold N is 43. With an available margin of 14 points (43 – 29 = 14) and with no card in the deck exceeding 13 points (even a King worth 13 would bring you to only 42), there is no risk of busting on your next draw. In light of the opponent’s fixed strategy and recalling that in earlier rounds you improved your total substantially by taking hits, you should aim to increase your total further to get as close as possible to 43. Therefore, the best move now is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation the key points are:\n• Your total is 41 and you must not exceed 43.\n• Hitting would add the next card drawn to your total. Only an Ace (value 1) or a 2 (value 2) would keep you at or below 43—this gives you around a 15% chance of staying safe (assuming an equal probability for each rank), while drawing any card of value 3 or higher (about 85% chance) would make you exceed the threshold.\n• Since your opponent’s behavior is fixed (and you have seen previous rounds where the opponent sometimes draws even at high levels), the safest strategy is to avoid the high risk of busting.\n\nConsidering the high risk of drawing a card that would pass 43, you should choose to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current round, your hand totals 41 while the threshold is 43. Taking another card could only be safe if the card’s value is either 1 (Ace) or 2; with an infinite deck uniformly providing 13 possibilities, that chance is only 2 in 13 (roughly 15%), which is quite low. In the previous rounds, your opponent’s fixed strategy has caused them to bust frequently even when they keep hitting. By standing at 41, you are already very close to 43 and forcing the opponent to take their chances while you minimize your risk. Therefore, the best move for you now is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on our current game situation, our total is 41 with a threshold of 43. Taking a hit would mean that only drawing an Ace (worth 1) or a 2 (worth 2) keeps us safe – any card 3 or above would cause us to exceed the threshold (41 + 3 = 44, which busts us). With an infinite deck and the values provided, the chance of pulling a safe card is relatively low (only two out of thirteen possibilities, if we assume equal likelihood), which makes hitting very risky.\n\nAdditionally, our opponent’s strategy—as observed in previous rounds—has often led them to exceed the threshold, giving us an edge when we stand on a relatively high total like 41. Considering that the opponent’s face-up card is an Ace (1 point) and we have better control over our current score without risking an immediate bust, it is safest to stand at this point.\n\nThus, to maximize our chance of winning this round and, in turn, the overall game, our optimal move now is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation, your total is 41 in a round with a threshold of 43. If you hit, only an Ace (counting as 1) or a 2 will keep you at or below the threshold (totaling 42 and 43 respectively), which gives you only a 2\/13 chance of staying safe. In contrast, standing at 41 risks very little since your opponent's fixed strategy in previous rounds has resulted in busts. Therefore, standing at 41 maximizes your chances of winning this round.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given the current situation, you’re at 20 points with a threshold of 28. If you stand with 20, you risk ending with a low total that might well be beaten by the opponent who, starting with a 6 and a hidden card, is likely to hit several times. By choosing to hit, you have a chance to improve your total closer to the threshold. However, any drawn card of value 9 or above (which includes 9, 10, J, Q, or K) would push you over 28, which would immediately lose the round. Note that, since the deck is infinite and all 13 card types appear with equal probability, there is an 8\/13 chance of drawing a card in the “safe” range (A through 8) that would give you a new total between 21 and 28, and a 5\/13 chance of busting.\n\nAlthough hitting carries risk, the potential to boost your total from 20 to something closer to 28 (and possibly hit exactly 28 if you draw an 8) outweighs the risk of standing too low. Given that your opponent must work their way up starting from 6 (with an unknown card), and based on previous rounds where achieving a sum closer to the threshold was often decisive, the best decision is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the game rules, you are allowed to hit until you decide to stand or until your total exceeds N. In the current round the threshold N is 28 and your cards are ['Q', '8', '9']. With the values assigned (Q = 12, 8 = 8, 9 = 9), your total equals 29, which is already above the threshold N. Since hitting further would only add to your total (making things no better), and you’re already in the “busted” state (exceeding N), your only reasonable course is to stop taking cards—i.e. Stand. Standing will force the round to proceed to settlement. There remains a possibility that your opponent may also bust (exceed N) on their turn, which would result in a draw rather than a loss. Therefore, the best move in this situation is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation, you already have a total of 29 while the round’s limit is 28. This means you’re over the allowed threshold (i.e. you’re “bust”) regardless of whether you take another card or not. Getting another card (“Hit”) won’t bring you any benefit—in fact, you’re forced to be over N, and the only possible outcome improvement would be if the opponent also busts later, which would only lead to a draw rather than a win. In short, since you’re already over the threshold, there’s no incentive to hit further; you should simply stop.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current information, the player’s total is 21 with a threshold of 33. In this game variant every extra card increases the risk of “busting” by overshooting N. However, at 21 the risk is very low since only drawing a K (worth 13) would lead to 34 (21+13), which is the only fatal card. The probability of drawing a K is about 1 in 13 (roughly 7.7%). Given that all other cards (Ace through Q) help raise the total closer to 33 without immediate busting, a hit is a good risk–reward play. Also, historical rounds show that waiting with a score that is too far from N can be disadvantageous when the opponent is following a fixed aggressive hitting strategy.\n\nThus, given that the cost of being “stuck” at 21 is high compared to the relatively low risk of busting with a hit, you should choose to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, your current total is 23 with a safe margin of 10 (33 – 23). Although standing now would be safe, the history shows that the opponent’s fixed strategy tends to push them over the limit (or at least yield totals that are hard to beat when playing conservatively). At 23 you risk losing if you stand (since many previous rounds suggest that if the opponent gets a “lucky” safe hit they can end with a total around 30 or so), while you have a very favorable probability (10⁄13 ≈77% chance) of drawing a card that won’t bust you. A hit would very likely bring you closer to 33—in fact, drawing a 10 would get you exactly to 33, and even a small card would improve your competitive total. Although there is some bust risk (~23%), the expected improvement in your position outweighs the risk given the opponent’s likely moves. \n\nThus, the optimal decision at this stage is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round situation, your current total is 15 and the threshold is 49. With an infinite deck, any additional card will add between 1 and 13 points. At 15 you are very safe (since 15+max 13 = 28, which is well below the threshold), and you need to build a much higher total to be competitive given the opponent’s strategy from previous rounds. Therefore, the best move is to request another card – Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round:\n• Your total is 22 while the threshold is 49. With plenty of room before busting, it’s beneficial to improve your total.\n• Even if you draw the highest card (a King with value 13), your total would become 35—still far from 49.\n• In previous rounds you’ve seen that playing safe when your total is low and pushing to get closer to the threshold tends to pay off.\n• The opponent’s situation is unclear because of the hidden cards, but with only one visible “8” their expected total is uncertain. You need to build a competitive score.\nTherefore, the best move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your current total is 31 and the threshold is 49, you are currently 18 points away from the maximum allowed. Since all cards in this game have values no greater than 13, you cannot bust by taking one more card no matter what. Also, from the history we see that your opponent’s totals often end up in the mid‐to‐high 30s or low 40s when they stop hitting, and they have already taken two hits this round. To have a better chance of winning this round, you need to be closer to 49 than your opponent. It is therefore in your best interest to risk another hit and try to improve your total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your current total is 35 and the threshold N is 49, you are in a “safe” zone for one more hit. No matter which card you draw (Ace being 1, number cards 2–10, and face cards capped at 13), your total will range between 36 (if you draw a 1) and 48 (if you draw a 13). In all cases you will remain under or equal to 49. Since your opponent’s final total in previous rounds tended to end up closer to the threshold—with many of their rounds resulting in totals that ultimately clashed with yours—it is advantageous here to take the hit so that you can get closer to 49 and secure a win when both sides compare their totals.\n\nThus, on turn 4 of Round 10, you should choose to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round, your total is 36 with a limit of 49. When you hit now any card you receive will add between 1 and 13 points. Because 36 + the worst-case 13 equals exactly 49, you are guaranteed not to bust on this hit. In contrast, standing at 36 would likely be too low if your opponent eventually reaches close to 49. Given the information from previous rounds—where the opponent’s play has been very aggressive—you want to improve your total now. Therefore, taking another card (Hit) is the best move.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Your current total is 49, which exactly meets the threshold, so taking another card (hitting) would risk going over the limit and unnecessarily jeopardize your winning chance. Therefore, based on the rules and the fact that you cannot improve on already hitting the threshold, the best move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

With such a high allowable total (N = 39) and having plenty of room to improve your score without immediately risking an overshoot, it’s a good idea to ask for another card. This gives you a better chance to get closer to 39 without busting. The opponent’s visible card is an Ace, which might indicate a good hand, so you need to try to improve your total sooner rather than later.\n\nAnswer: Hit","From the current state, your total is 23 and you’re well below the threshold of 39. Since you’ve only taken one hit so far and your cards add to 23, any additional card (minimum 1 and maximum 13) will only bring you closer to 39 without the risk of busting (even the worst case, 23+13=36, stays safe). Standing now with a relatively low total risks that your opponent, who is likely striving to approach 39, will end up with a higher total. Therefore, the optimal decision is to ask for another card – in short, Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","The current total is 28 and the threshold is 39. Since you’re 11 points away from the threshold, drawing another card can help you get much closer to 39. In the infinite deck, each card value (Ace = 1, 2–10 at face value, J = 11, Q = 12, K = 13) is equally likely. If you draw a card valued 12 or 13, you would exceed the threshold (28 + 12 = 40 or 28 + 13 = 41), but drawing any card of value 1 through 11 keeps you in play, and an 11 actually brings you exactly to 39. That means you have a 11\/13 chance (about 84.6%) of improving your position and only a roughly 15.4% chance of busting. Given that risk reward and considering the opponent hasn’t revealed much more than an Ace (1), it is advantageous to hit. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Considering your current total of 36 and a threshold of 39, if you choose to hit you run a high risk of busting. Only drawing an Ace (1), a 2, or a 3 would keep you under (or exactly at) 39 (totaling 37, 38, or 39, respectively); drawing any other card would push you over the limit. Given that only 3 out of 13 equally likely card outcomes (about 23%) would be safe, the risk of busting is very high. In contrast, standing at 36 may not be maximum but avoids an almost 77% chance of busting immediately, and your opponent’s fixed strategy (which involves hitting until a certain point) means there is a reasonable chance they too may bust or end up with a lower total. \n\nThus, the best move in this scenario is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Considering your total is 36, you have only 3 points remaining before reaching the threshold of 39. If you request another card (“hit”), only cards with a value of 1, 2, or 3 keep you safe—three outcomes out of 13 possible (about 23% chance). The other 10 outcomes will push you over 39, instantly busting your hand. Meanwhile, if you “stand” at 36, you avoid the high risk of busting. Although the opponent’s situation is unclear due to the unknown cards, the risk of your own bust is exceedingly high with a hit at this point. Therefore, the optimal decision is to stand. \n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation, you currently have 36 (from 10 + 2 + J (11) + 5 + 8) while the threshold is 39. If you take another card (“hit”), you must draw a card that adds 1, 2, or 3 to stay at or below 39. In an infinite deck (with 13 card types: Ace (1), 2, 3, 4, …, 10, J (11), Q (12), K (13) all equally likely), only 3 out of 13 cards are “safe” (Ace, 2, 3). That is roughly a 23% chance of being safe and a 77% chance that you bust immediately.\n\nMeanwhile, if you stand with 36, you give up the chance to improve your total but avoid the high bust risk. Although the opponent has a series of unknown cards and a fixed strategy (likely taking risks as well), you already see that the probability of busting upon hitting is very high (over 75%). Therefore, the best decision in this situation is to “Stand.”\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on your current total of 36 with N = 39, if you hit you risk busting since any card with a value of 4 or more (which happens in 10 out of 13 cases) would push you past 39. Only drawing an Ace (1), a 2, or a 3 would keep you safe, giving you totals of 37, 38, or 39 respectively. Although a higher total might improve your chance against the opponent’s drawn total, the high bust probability (approximately 77%) makes it too risky. Given your opponent’s strategy of continuously hitting, it is likely that standing at 36 maximizes your chance of winning (especially if the opponent eventually busts or ends with a lower total).\n\nThus, the best play here is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on our situation we already have a strong total of 36 out of a maximum of 39. At this point, if we “hit” our only hope of improvement is to receive a card of value 1, 2, or 3 (because 36+4 = 40, which is over the threshold). With an infinite deck where every card type is equally likely out of 13 possibilities (Ace counts as 1, plus the numbered cards and the three face cards with values 11, 12, 13), that gives us only a 3⁄13 chance (roughly 23%) of staying safe. Furthermore, our opponent’s history shows him collecting many cards while still staying safe; although his exact score isn’t visible, his fixed strategy suggests he is trying to “get as close as possible” to 39. In our case a bust on our side guarantees a loss, and since we already have a near‐maximum safe total, the risk is simply not worth it. Therefore, the optimal move is to “Stand.”\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given that your current total is 17 and the threshold (N) is 48, you are very far from busting by requesting an additional card. Every card drawn has an average value of 7 and even the highest card (K = 13) would only bring your total to 30, well under the threshold. In addition, you have full information about previous rounds showing that the opponent’s strategy involves hitting repeatedly, which indicates they may also take risks to get closer to the threshold. Since you are not in any danger by drawing one card now and you need to get closer to 48 to win, it is clearly advantageous to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on what we know, our total is 21 while the opponent only shows a 5 and has two unknown cards. With the threshold set at 48, there is considerable room before we risk busting. In the previous round the opponent’s strategy was very aggressive—continuing to hit many times even beyond what would be safe—so it’s likely they will keep playing aggressively in the current round as well. Standing now with 21 would leave us far from the threshold, almost guaranteeing that if the opponent doesn't bust, their higher total will beat ours. Given the wide headroom before reaching 48 and our need to get closer to N in order to improve our chances of winning, we should take an additional card (Hit) at turn 2.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given your current total is 33 and the threshold is 48, you have a wide safety margin. No matter which card you draw (even the highest value, K worth 13, would bring you only to 46), you cannot bust in this turn. In addition, drawing another card can only move your total closer to 48, which is beneficial when you compare your score to the opponent’s unknown hand. Therefore, it is optimal to hit on Turn 3.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I analyzed your current total of 38 with a threshold of 48. Note that if you request an extra card, you will add between 1 and 13 points. Adding any card from 1 to 10 (Ace through 10) will get your new total between 39 (38+1) and 48 (38+10). However, if you receive a face card (J, Q, or K – which are worth 11, 12 or 13), you’ll bust (for instance, 38+11 = 49, which is over 48).\n\nSince there are 13 equally possible card values, 10 out of 13 outcomes (values 1 through 10) are safe (approximately 77% chance) while 3 out of 13 outcomes (the face cards) will make you bust (about 23% chance).\n\nIn addition, consider that your current total of 38 is somewhat low compared to the available limit of 48. In the previous round, the opponent hit aggressively and ended up well above your total—even though they eventually busted in that round, their fixed strategy appears to push them to high totals. Increasing your own total puts you in a better position, and since you have a 77% chance of drawing a safe card (with a possible outcome of reaching exactly 48 if you get a 10), the expected benefit outweighs the risk.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move in this current situation is to request an extra card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","We see that your cards add up to 49, which is already above the threshold N of 48. According to the rules, if you exceed the threshold you risk automatic loss unless your opponent also busts. Since additional cards will only increase your total further (and not bring you back under N), there is no benefit in taking another hit. The best action is to stand and let the outcome be decided, even though you’re already in a bust situation.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current situation, you have a relatively low total (19) while the threshold is 41. Since you can risk drawing additional cards without the danger of immediately bursting—even if the worst value (K, worth 13) is drawn, your total would only be 32—you should aim to improve your score significantly. Moreover, the dealer’s visible card is a “10,” indicating that they may have a strong hand, and you want to increase your total to better compete. Thus, it is advisable to request another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","The idea is to achieve a total that is as close as possible to the threshold (41) without exceeding it. At the moment your total is 21 from cards ['10', '9', '2]. With a safe margin of 20 points (41–21=20) and given that the maximum card value is 13, you have room to draw one or even two more cards without immediately risking a bust. In previous rounds the opponent kept on hitting even when the player had stood, and his face‐up card is 10. Since his hidden cards are unknown, his eventual total could be high or even result in a bust. By hitting now you have the opportunity both to improve your own total and put pressure on him.\n\nThus, the best move given the current scenario is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our situation the threshold is 41 and you currently have a total of 25. Because the maximum card value is 13 and you’re still 16 points away from 41, there is no risk of busting if you take another card. In contrast, your opponent has already taken two hits and appears to follow a strategy that makes him hit repeatedly (even if he ends up busting, his unknown cards leave you uncertain about his final total). Given that you can safely improve your total without the risk of overshooting, “Hit” is the best option to push your total closer to 41, increasing your chances to beat your opponent’s eventual score.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is 30 – well below the threshold of 41 – which means you have some “room” to improve your hand. Drawing one more card gives you a good chance of approaching 41 without busting (only a Q or K, which represent 12 or 13 respectively, would cause you to exceed 41). The probability of busting is roughly 2 in 13, about a 15% chance, while the remaining 85% of cards are safe and will improve your hand. In contrast, if you choose to stand with 30, you almost certainly leave the door open for your opponent, who is expected to continue hitting and is likely to reach a total closer to 41. Therefore, the optimal move in this round is to take another card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on what we see now, your total is 33, and the threshold is 41. That means you currently have an 8‐point “gap” to 41. If you choose to hit, you risk drawing a card that adds more than 8 (namely 9, 10, J, Q, or K), which would bust you. On an infinite deck with 13 different ranks, there are 8 “safe” cards (Ace through 8) and 5 “dangerous” cards giving about a 62% chance of a safe hit. (To clarify: drawing an Ace gives 1 point, two gives 2, …, eight gives 8; while nine, ten, and face cards are too high.) \n\nLooking at your opponent’s history – in rounds 1 and 2 the opponent’s moves were very “hit‐oriented” (they kept taking cards even if it meant exceeding the threshold) and their only visible card is a 10 in this round. Given that the opponent’s fixed strategy seems to be to take another card each turn even when nearing the threshold, if you stand now at 33 you run a high risk of ending up with a total far from 41 when the opponent manages to pull closer (or even not bust on his extra hits). \n\nThus, even though hitting carries a bust risk (about 38%), the upside is that you have a chance to reach a total closer to 41 – and even exactly 41 if an 8 comes – which is almost unbeatable. Rounding all considerations (the relatively low total of 33 compared to the threshold, the likelihood that the opponent is forced to hit with little regard for safety, and the significant benefit if you safely improve your hand), the best move is to ask for an additional card (hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation and the records from previous rounds, you have a total of 17 while the threshold is 27. If you stand, you will finish with 17—a full 10 points shy of the limit. Given that hitting now gives you a roughly 77% chance (10 out of 13 card values) to receive a card that won’t push you over 27 (only J\/Q\/K would bust) and that these safe draws can improve your total closer to 27, it is optimal to try to improve your hand. Furthermore, your opponent’s fixed strategy appears to be quite aggressive (as seen in previous rounds), and standing on 17 would likely leave you at a disadvantage. Therefore, the best play is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is 24 with a threshold of 27. This leaves only a margin of 3 points, meaning that if you request an extra card (a Hit) you’re safe only if you draw an Ace (worth 1), a 2, or a 3. Since there are 13 types of cards in an infinite deck and only 3 of them (Ace, 2, and 3) are safe draws, the safe probability is only 3\/13 (roughly 23%). There is about a 77% chance that a hit will result in a bust.\n\nGiven that risk, and considering that your opponent’s one visible card is a 6 (suggesting his total might not be too aggressive initially), it is much more optimal to stand with a total of 24 rather than risk busting with a hit. Standing, even though not at the very top of the threshold, gives you a better chance of winning or at least drawing the round under the fixed strategy the opponent is using.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current situation the optimal move is to hit. Your current total is only 7, which is far from the threshold 34. It makes sense to try and build a stronger hand before coming close to 34, and with such a low total you have plenty of room before risking going over. Considering the opponent’s previous strategy, you want a total that can compete if they try to push for a high score (or risk busting by going over 34). Hence, you should request an additional card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation you have a total of 16 and the threshold is 34. Since even the highest possible card (a King worth 13 points) would only bring your total to 29—well below the threshold—it is safe to ask for another card. Given that the opponent’s face‐up card is only 2 and they are likely to continue hitting based on their fixed strategy, you improving your total is clearly the better option. Therefore, the best move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, your total is 25 while the threshold is 34. That means you’re 9 points away from the limit. A hit would add a card drawn from an infinite deck where each of the 13 card types is equally likely (values 1, 2, …, 13). In other words, if you hit, the new card won’t make you bust only if its value is 9 or less (9 out of 13 possibilities, roughly 70% chance). Obtaining a card 9 or under will bring you closer to 34 and improve your chances of beating your opponent (who, judging by previous rounds, typically “overshoots” his limit by a small margin when following his fixed strategy).\n\nStaying at 25 would nearly guarantee that his (likely higher but still busting) total will beat yours since being 9 away is a significant gap. Therefore, it is strategically best for you to request another card (Hit) in an attempt to approach 34 without going over. \n\nAnswer: Hit","We currently have a total of 26 and the round’s threshold is 34. That means if we choose to hit, the card we draw must be 8 or less (since 26 + 9 = 35, which would exceed 34) in order to keep us safe. In an infinite deck where all 13 types of cards (Ace through King) are equally likely, the “safe” cards are Ace (worth 1), and the numbers 2 through 8. That gives us 8 safe cards out of 13, i.e. about a 61.5% chance to improve our hand without busting. A safe hit would raise our total to between 27 and 34, which puts us considerably closer to the threshold and makes it harder for our opponent to win (since his strategy appears to be very “hit-heavy”, often overshooting the threshold).\n\nOn the other hand, standing with 26 leaves a significant gap (8 points from the threshold) that the opponent might bridge or might even overshoot, but given his fixed approach in previous rounds his hits have sometimes resulted in busts—only our hand improving gives us more control. Considering the probability of remaining safe (over 60%) and the fact that drawing a safe card nudges us closer to the winning threshold, the optimal decision here is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your total is 29 and the threshold is 34, you’re only 5 points away from the upper limit. At 29 you are at a disadvantage because if you stand the opponent may soon reach 30–34 and win by being closer to the threshold (or push you if you both bust\/are equal). With your 29 you need at least a card value of 1 up to 5 to safely land on a total between 30 and 34 – but if you draw a 6 or higher you’ll exceed 34 and lose (unless the opponent also busts, resulting in a draw). That means that in a single hit, you have roughly a 5 in 13 chance (about 38.5% probability) to get a safe card and, hopefully, a competitive total.\n\nLooking at the history, your opponent’s fixed strategy has repeatedly led them to push right past the threshold even to the point of busting. However, at this lower threshold (34) they are beginning with a very small upcard (a 2), and although their exact total is unknown, you must assume they will also try to get as close to 34 as possible. Standing at 29 seems too conservative and leaves you very vulnerable if they make a safe hit and improve their total.\n\nConsidering that if you hit and obtain a safe card you will be in a better position and that standing at 29 gives the opponent an easy margin to win, the best risk\/reward play is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the game board and rules, your current total is 41, which has already exceeded the threshold of 34. Since the rules state that once you exceed the threshold you cannot improve your situation (additional cards will only add more points), the optimal move is to \"Stand\" rather than \"Hit.\"\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current round:\n\n• The threshold is 35 and your current total is only 17 (with your cards [6, J] = 6 + 11).\n• Since drawing any card (the worst possible being K = 13) would give you at most 17 + 13 = 30, you cannot bust on your first hit.\n• In previous rounds we saw that playing too cautiously (standing too early) sometimes left you too far from the threshold. With 17, you are rather low relative to 35.\n• It is optimal to take another card (Hit) to improve your total and be closer to 35.\n\nThus, I recommend you choose to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","My analysis:\n• With a threshold (N) of 35 and your current sum at 22, you still have plenty of margin; even the strongest card (K, worth 13) would only bring you to exactly 35.\n• Considering that reaching a sum closer to 35 is crucial and your opponent’s fixed strategy indicates they continue hitting until closing in on that target, it is statistically beneficial to hit.\n• Thus, aiming to get closer to 35 while staying safe from busting, the recommended move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your current total is 29 and the threshold for this round is 35 you’re still 6 points away from the cap. If you stand with 29 it is highly likely that your opponent—whose visible card is an Ace and whose strategy in previous rounds generally involves drawing additional cards—will reach a total closer to 35 (or even exceed it) while you will be left with a relatively low total. By hitting, you try to bring your total closer to 35. Of course, drawing a card is risky because any card above 6 (namely, the 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, or K) would put you above 35. In an infinite deck, assuming each of the 13 ranks is equally likely, there’s roughly a 6\/13 chance (about 46%) of drawing a “safe” card (Ace through 6) and a 7\/13 chance (about 54%) of busting. However, note that if you bust but your opponent also exceeds the threshold later, the round results in a draw (0.5 score instead of a 0 loss).\n\nSince a stand at 29 would likely leave you at a disadvantage against an opponent whose fixed strategy seems to aim for maximizing their score (even if risking busting), the expectation from hitting—despite the inherent risk—is that it increases your chance of closing the gap toward 35. Thus, with only 6 points below the threshold and the opponent’s apparent willingness to hit for a high total, the best action is to try for a higher total by hitting.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round, your total is exactly 35 which is equal to the round’s threshold (N = 35). Since any additional card would add at least 1 point—and force you to exceed the threshold—you would automatically bust if you hit. Also, your opponent’s strategy (as recorded in previous rounds) appears to involve taking a risk by hitting repeatedly; by standing now, you avoid busting while the opponent may end up overshooting or ending with a lower total. Therefore, the optimal move in this situation is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given that your current hand totals exactly 35 – which meets the threshold – there is no advantage in taking another card. Any additional card (even the lowest value, Ace = 1) would raise your total above 35 and result in a bust if the opponent hasn't exceeded the threshold. Based on this risk-reward consideration and the fixed opponent strategy observed in previous rounds, the optimal move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Your current total is exactly 35, which is equal to the threshold (N). Any further hit would add at least 1 point and cause you to exceed the threshold, thereby risking an immediate loss if the opponent does not bust. Given that you’re already at the optimal score without busting, the best move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on our current round, the threshold is 32 and your total is only 18. Since your hand is far from the limit and even the highest possible card (King is worth 13) would bring you only to 31, hitting is completely safe. In addition, by adding another card you have a good chance of getting closer to 32 without busting, which should put more pressure on your opponent who is following a fixed strategy. Therefore, the recommended move is to \"hit\".\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation and our analysis, our current total is 27 – we’re five points away from the limit of 32. Because the safe “hit” cards (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5) come only about 5 out of 13 times while any 6 or above (8 out of 13 chances) would make us bust, taking another card is quite risky. In contrast, if we stand at 27 the opponent (with a face–up Q and two unknown cards) must work from a starting point (roughly 12 plus two random draws) such that even if they are safe the chance that they end up with a total lower than ours is quite decent. The probability balance roughly suggests that by standing we’d win roughly two–thirds of the time (and draw in a small portion) while hitting risks busting most of the time. \n\nThus, it is best to choose Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation, you currently have a total of 27 while the threshold is 32. Standing means you will finish with 27, which is considerably lower than possible totals the opponent might safely build from their Q (12) plus several unknown cards. Although hitting comes with a risk (since you only have a safe window with card values 1–5, about a 38% chance), improving your total closer to 32 is essential because if you stand, most likely your opponent will reach a higher total without busting (or both might even bust in which case the rules favor the non‐busting side). The history shows that in rounds where you stayed too low (as in Round 4 with 24) the opponent won, so the improvement is needed. \n\nTherefore, the optimal decision is to take a hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that the threshold is quite high (48) and your current total is only 9 (with cards 7 and 2), you are very far from the target. In all previous rounds even when opponent’s visible card wasn’t too strong, you benefited from hitting until you built a total closer to the threshold while staying safe. Here, with so much room and knowing the opponent’s fixed strategy tends to draw many cards (often overshooting or ending with moderate totals), the best play is to ask for another card.\n\nThus, the correct move for your turn is “Hit”.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I'll analyze the situation. In Round 8 the threshold is 48 and you currently have a total of 16 (cards: 7, 2, and 7). Since cards range from 1 (Ace) up to 13 (K) and your next drawn card will add at most 13 points, there is no risk of busting on your very next hit (16 + 13 = 29, which is still well below 48). In every previous round the opponent followed a fixed pattern—taking a number of hits regardless of the risk (with their face‐down card and hits coming in one by one), and the outcomes often ended with the opponent ending up over N while you stayed safely under or close to N.\n\nBecause your total is very low (16 is far away from the threshold 48) and you are safe to take another card, your best strategy is to Hit in order to improve your position and get closer to 48. There is nearly no risk in this round by taking an extra card, and building a higher total will make it harder for your opponent to overtake or win once the cards are turned over as the opponent does not change his strategy.\n\nThus, based on the current game board and past performance, your move should be to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, your current total is 29 and you have plenty of room to safely draw a card (since the threshold is 48). No matter what card you might draw (the highest‐value card is K which is 13 points), even if you get the maximum you’d have 42, which is still under 48. In previous rounds the opponent’s fixed strategy led them to overshoot or stop at totals that rarely left them much room; by improving your total now you can get closer to 48 and force your opponent into a difficult position. In addition, because you have seen that your opponent tends to take extra hits–often ending in a bust or barely keeping up (as in rounds 1, 2, 6, and 7)–increasing your total by hitting improves your chance to win this round. \n\nThus, in this situation the best move is to take another card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, you have a total of 33 with a safe margin (since any card from 1 to 13 won’t immediately bust you when added to 33 under a threshold of 48). Because you’re quite far from 48, it is best to take another card in hopes of moving closer to the target without risk of busting in this immediate turn. Therefore, the optimal decision here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, you currently have a total of 41 and the threshold is 48. In your next move, if you choose to hit you are adding one card from an infinite deck. In this deck the safe card values (ones that won’t take you over 48) are those with value 1–7 (since 41 + 7 = 48 exactly), while any card with value 8 or higher will cause you to bust immediately. There is a 7\/13 chance (about 54%) of receiving a safe card and a 6\/13 chance (about 46%) of busting. \n\nIf you hit and draw a safe card, your total will improve (ranging from a low of 42 to a perfect 48); on average, if safe, you should reach around 45, which is much closer to the threshold than 41. On the other hand, if you stand at 41 you leave yourself on the short end, especially noting that your opponent’s fixed strategy suggests they will continue to hit (as seen in previous rounds) and may very well improve their total without busting. \n\nTaking into account the risk–reward trade‐off (a bit more than a 50% chance to improve significantly versus about a 46% chance of immediate bust) and your opponent’s behavior patterns in earlier rounds, the best decision now is to take the risk and hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round, your card total is already 49, which exceeds the threshold of 48. Since the rules state that if you exceed N while the opponent does not, you lose (and if both exceed it's a draw), taking another hit would only add to your total and worsen your situation. Therefore, your best move is to Stand and hope that the opponent also exceeds the threshold, which would result in a draw, rather than giving them a chance to win outright.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on our current total of 18 versus a dealer showing Q (worth 12) and an unknown hole card, we expect the dealer’s initial sum to be around 19 (since the unknown card’s average is 7). In previous rounds the opponent was seen to hit several times (even when the threshold was in the low 40s) until reaching a high total or busting. With our total at 18—far from the limit of 42—we have plenty of room to safely improve our hand. Standing now would leave us very far from the threshold and below the likely final total of our opponent if they continue their fixed hitting strategy. It is in our best interest to take another card (Hit) to improve our total so that we have a chance to get closer to 42 while banking on the possibility that the opponent may bust or not improve enough to beat us.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our analysis, your current total is 31 and the round threshold is 42. If you decide to hit, you have a high chance (11 out of 13 types, roughly 85%) of drawing a card with value 11 or less—which would keep you safely at or below 42. On the other hand, standing on 31 leaves you well short of the threshold, and given that your opponent has already taken a card (and appears to be following a strategy of trying to approach the threshold), you'll need to improve your total. The risk of busting (drawing a Q or K, which would be 2 out of 13 possibilities, roughly 15%) is relatively low compared to the benefit of moving closer to 42. Therefore, based on the analysis and the history of the rounds, the optimal move in this situation is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your total is 40 and the threshold is 42, you only have room for an extra 1 or 2 points. Drawing any card with a value of 3 or higher would put you over the threshold and immediately cause you to lose the round. With an infinite deck having 13 distinct card values (Ace through King, where Ace is 1 and face cards have higher values), only an Ace (1) or a 2 would be safe hits. This gives you only about a 2\/13 chance (roughly 15%) of not busting. The risk of busting (approximately 85%) when hitting is far too high compared with standing at 40. Also, considering your opponent has already taken two hits in the round and their only face‐up card is a Queen (valued at 12), it’s quite likely that their total might not greatly challenge your high 40 if they don’t manage their hits as carefully. \n\nThus, the optimal move in this situation is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the rules and our current hand (8 and 3, totaling 11) against a threshold of 37—with the dealer showing a K (worth 13)—our situation is far from the upper limit. Since each additional card (which on average is worth 7 points) helps us get closer to 37 without immediate risk of “busting” (because even the highest card—K worth 13—would only bring 11 up to 24), it is optimal to continue taking cards (i.e. Hit) until our total is considerably increased. Waiting (standing) with only 11 would leave us at a huge disadvantage versus the dealer’s starting card and the likelihood that the dealer will hit until reaching a higher total. \n\nThus, the best move now is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current situation, your total is 20 and you have plenty of “room” (since N = 37, you cannot bust with any card – the maximum card is 13, which would bring you to 33). Because you’re well below the threshold and you want to get as close as possible to 37 (or force the opponent into a difficult situation), the obvious choice is to request an additional card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation we have:\n• Your hand is [8, 3, 9, Q] for a total of 32 while the threshold is 37. That means you have a “safe gap” of 5 points.\n• By “hitting” you risk drawing a card that is too high (if you draw any card valued 6 or more—in an infinite deck each card type is equally likely, so there’s an 8\/13 chance you bust), but if you pull a card with value 1–5 (a 5\/13 chance) you’ll improve your total (to somewhere between 33 and 37). In particular, a 5 gets you exactly to 37.\n• Looking at the history the opponent—whose only known visible card in this round is a K (worth 13)—has been following a fixed “hit‐until–done” strategy that, while it sometimes nets a competitive total, often ends up overshooting the threshold.\n• If you stand with 32 you will be quite far (5 points) from the threshold, giving your opponent plenty of chance to draw to a “safe” total (very likely in rounds with similar thresholds) and beat your 32.\n• Whereas, even though a hit carries a high bust risk (about 62%), if you draw a safe card (about 38% chance) you improve your standing considerably—especially if you get a 5 (which brings you exactly to 37). In this case even if the opponent manages a decent total the aggressive strategy used in previous rounds often causes the opponent to overshoot.\n \nConsidering these factors and weighing the risk (which could be acceptable given the opponent’s demonstrated tendency to overshoot) against the potential reward, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, your total is already 43, which is greater than the round threshold 37. Once you’ve exceeded N you can’t get closer to the target, and any additional hit would only push your total higher (which doesn’t matter because when both sides exceed the threshold the outcome is a draw). In previous rounds we’ve seen that if both bust it settles as a draw (yielding 0.5 points), whereas if you stand with a busted total then it’s up to the opponent’s fixed strategy to force a win if they play safely. Since you already have 43 (>37), there is no benefit in drawing another card. Your best chance is to try to get the opponent to also exceed the threshold so that the round ends as a draw instead of a loss.\n\nTherefore, your optimal move for turn 4 is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

With such a low risk of bust (exceeding 47) on the next hit—even accounting for the maximum value card (K valued at 13, which would bring you to 26)—it makes sense to draw another card to improve your position. Moreover, your opponent’s visible card is a 9, and with a hidden card whose value is unknown, there’s little information to suggest standing now. The optimal decision in this scenario is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","You currently have a total of 18 out of a threshold of 47. Given that the risk of busting is very low at 18 (since even the highest card, a King, is 13 points, and 18+13=31, which is still far from 47), it is advisable to take another card in order to get closer to the threshold. In addition, the opponent’s first two moves (both have “hit”) suggest they are likely following a strategy that aims to approach 47 as well, so playing too conservatively (standing) with only 18 could put you at a disadvantage in the settlement if they improve their hand. Therefore, the best move in Turn 2 is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our cards (3, 10, 5, J = 29) and knowing that the threshold is 47, we have a comfortable margin even if we draw the highest‐value card (K = 13) because 29 + 13 = 42, which is still under 47. Since the opponent’s cards include an exposed 9 but the rest are unknown, and considering that in this game being closer to 47 is the key to winning, it makes sense to improve our total while we’re safely under the threshold. Given that the opponent has already hit twice and will likely try to get as high as possible without busting, our current total of 29 is too far from 47 to risk a stand now.\n\nTherefore, given the ample headroom (18 points available) and the potential to improve our position toward 47, the best move at this stage is to request another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current cards and the risk–reward analysis, your total is 41 and the threshold is 47. That leaves you a safe gap of only 6 points. If you choose to hit, only cards with a value of 6 or less (Ace counted as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) will keep you safely at or under 47. Under an infinite deck with uniform probability over the 13 card types, that means there’s a 6\/13 (about 46%) chance of a safe card and a 7\/13 (about 54%) chance of busting immediately. Although safely hitting could bring your average up to roughly 44.5, that small gain does not outweigh the high risk of busting.\n\nGiven that if you stand at 41 you keep a viable total against an opponent who—according to history—has taken similar hits, the safer play is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the rules and current situation, your total is 41 and the threshold is 47. If you stand at 41, you’ll likely lose since your opponent (with a visible 9 and four unknown cards from previous hits) is expected to finish closer to 47 without busting. By hitting, you risk drawing a card that makes your total exceed 47; however, only cards with values 7 or higher (7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K) will bust you—7 out of 13 possible card types (≈53.8% chance). On the other hand, if you draw one of the “safe” cards (Ace counted as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) – a 6 in 13 chance (≈46.2%)—you’ll improve your total to between 42 and 47. Even though the risk is a bit higher than the safe chance, standing at 41 is most likely even less competitive against an opponent who already has five cards and is still hitting.\n\nGiven that you need a higher total to win or at least tie (and considering that a final total of 47 is the best you can hope for without busting), it is reasonable to try to improve your position by taking a hit despite the risk.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is 41 while the ceiling is 47. With 41 you are 6 points shy of the target—but you also know that your opponent has already taken several cards. Although drawing a new card risks busting (because any card with value 7 or above would push you over 47), the chance to improve your total and possibly reach 47 (or at least a higher total like 42–46) is important when playing against an opponent whose final total is unknown but likely to be competitive.\n\nIf you hit, you’ll only be safe if you draw one of A (1), 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 (a probability of 6⁄13 assuming each card type is equally likely), whereas drawing a 7, 8, 9, 10, or a face card (J, Q, or K, which are valued at 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 respectively with appropriate values as given) will make you bust. Even though this gives you roughly a 46% chance of getting a safe card (and among those, only drawing a 6 gets you exactly to 47—while the others leave you with totals in the low 40s), standing on 41 seems too low considering your opponent has already shown a willingness to draw several cards.\n\nThus, you must choose between risking a bust now or having a total that may be too low to beat an opponent who might improve his hand. Given the described circumstances and the fixed opponent strategy, the chance to get even a mild improvement with a hit outweighs the risk. Therefore, the optimal decision on turn 6 is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, you have a relatively low total of 13 (with cards 2 and J) and a threshold of 31. This gives you plenty of room before reaching the limit. In contrast, your opponent starts with a face‐up card of 7 and an unknown card, so you have incomplete information regarding their total. Since your total is far from the risk of busting and you need a better score than your opponent by getting close to 31, the optimal choice is to ask for another card, i.e. to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round the player’s total is 19 and the threshold is 31. Considering that on a hit you will get another card from an infinite deck (where Ace counts as 1, numbers as their value, and face cards are 11–13) and you only bust if the new card pushes your total above 31, your bust risk is relatively low at this stage. In particular, you can safely draw most card values (only a card of 13 would result in a bust in this circumstance). In contrast, standing at 19 is rather far from the target 31 and is unlikely to beat your opponent if they continue taking cards with their fixed strategy. Therefore, the proper decision to improve your chance of getting closer to 31 without busting is to take another card – that is, to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round the threshold is 31 and your hand totals 20 (cards: 2, J, 6, A). At 20 you are far from 31, so standing on 20 would likely be too low compared to your opponent’s eventual total. Moreover, drawing another card carries some risk since values 12 (Q) and 13 (K) will cause you to bust (since 20 + 12 = 32 > 31, etc.). Given that cards are drawn from an infinite deck with 13 equally likely outcomes, only 2 out of 13 card types would bust you—about a 15% chance of busting. This gives you roughly an 85% chance of safely increasing your total and coming closer to 31 without busting. Since your aim is to get as close as possible to 31 (to beat your opponent’s final total) and you are currently considerably under that mark, the best move here is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your total (21) is considerably below the threshold (31) and you still have a wide margin before reaching bust (only bust if you draw an 11, 12, or 13), it’s generally wise to improve your position. The opponent has already chosen to stand on turn 3, which likely means they believe they have a competitive total. However, since you are aiming to be as close to 31 as possible and your current total (21) leaves you at a disadvantage, taking the risk of drawing another card (with a roughly 23% bust chance, based on 3 out of 13 safe possibilities that would exceed your margin) is justified given the circumstances, especially in light of the opponent stopping early this round.\n\nSo, based on the available information and the analysis of risk versus reward in this situation, your best move on turn 4 is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Considering the threshold is 31 and your current total is 30, hitting is extremely risky. A hit would only be safe if you receive an Ace (worth 1 point), which would bring your total to exactly 31. However, since the deck is infinite with each card type equally likely, there’s roughly a 1\/13 chance of drawing an Ace. With approximately a 92% chance to draw a card that would push you over 31 and force you to bust, the risk outweighs the potential benefit. In contrast, standing with 30 leaves the outcome to what your opponent finalizes with, and given his fixed (and likely conservative) strategy – already hitting twice before standing – your chances are better if you avoid risking a bust by hitting.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation, your total is very low (7 versus a threshold of 28). Because the opponent’s fixed strategy appears to be to keep hitting until at least reaching (N – 4) (that is, 24 in this round) and you see that even in previous rounds the opponent often “stopped” when they roughly approached that level, you have plenty of room to safely draw extra cards. With a starting score of only 7, there is zero immediate risk of busting by drawing one more card (since any single card drawn gives at most 13 extra points, and 7 + 13 = 20, which is still less than 28). \n\nThus, to have a chance to outscore the opponent (who is very likely to end up somewhere in the low– to mid–20’s given his strategy) you need to build up your total closer to 28. For that, your best move on this turn is to request another card – a “Hit.” \n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the current situation, your total is 14 and the threshold is 28. That means no matter which card you draw—the smallest being an Ace (1) and the largest being a King (13)—your new total will range from 15 to 27, so you cannot exceed the threshold with your next card. Therefore, it is optimal to take a hit at this time.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round status, your total is 27 with a threshold of 28. That means if you choose to hit, you only have a chance to safely receive a card worth 1 point (an Ace). Since the deck is infinite and there are 13 card types (Ace, 2–10, J, Q, K), the probability of drawing an Ace is 1\/13 (around 7.7%). Any other card would push your total over 28, resulting in an immediate bust.\n\nMeanwhile, if you stand at 27, although the opponent’s exact final total is unknown due to their hidden cards and their fixed strategy, your chance of busting is zero. The risk of hitting (over 92% chance of busting) is far too great compared with the almost negligible improvement you could gain (from 27 to 28) by drawing an Ace.\n\nThus, the optimal move here is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given that your current total is 27 and the threshold is 28, if you take another card (hit) you run the risk of exceeding the threshold unless you draw an Ace (worth 1 point), which is the only card that would bring your total exactly to 28. With an infinite deck of 13 types of cards (each equally likely), the chance of drawing an Ace is 1\/13 (≈7.7%), while the risk (12\/13 or ≈92.3%) is that you’ll bust by exceeding the threshold. Since your opponent’s strategy in previous rounds generally involved accumulating as close to the threshold as possible while taking risks, standing now gives you the best chance to win or at least draw (if the opponent busts or only reaches 27) without the high risk of immediately going over.\n\nTherefore, your best move at this point is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the information we have, you start with a relatively low total (19 out of a 45‐point threshold) and your opponent’s known up‐card is only a “4”. In all previous rounds the opponent appears to keep drawing until reaching a “safe” total near the threshold (for example, ending up four or five points short of the threshold). In the current round with N = 45 the opponent is likely to continue drawing until his total is above what you currently have. Meanwhile, there’s no risk of busting if you draw at this point because no single card (with a maximum value of 13) can push you over 45 when added to 19.\n\nThus, to improve your position against an opponent who is following a fixed strategy and who will probably push his total higher than your current 19, it is optimal for you to request an additional card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, you have a total of 29 and the threshold is 45. Because the cards only go as high as 13 (even face cards are at most 13 points), taking another card cannot make you exceed 45. In other words, even the worst draw (a King, 13) would bring you to only 42. Therefore, it is advantageous to hit so you can try to get closer to 45 and beat your opponent.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, your current total is 32 and the threshold is 45. Since any hit will add a card between 1 and 13 (all of which keep you under or equal to 45 when added to 32), you are safe from busting on this turn. In previous rounds the opponent’s final totals tended to be around 4–5 points away from the threshold, and with your current total of 32 you are at a significant disadvantage if you stand. By taking a hit you have the opportunity to improve your score and get even closer to 45, which is very likely to help you win given the opponent’s pattern. Therefore, the best move in this situation is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","After analyzing the situation, here’s the reasoning: Your current total is 34 and the threshold is 45. By taking an extra card (hitting), you have 11 points of “room” before reaching the threshold. Since the card values are drawn evenly from an infinite deck, the only cards that would cause you to bust are the Queen (value 12) and King (value 13) because 34 + 12 = 46 and 34 + 13 = 47 (both exceeding 45). This gives you a bust probability of 2\/13 (about 15.4%), while in 11\/13 (about 84.6%) of cases you will get a safe card.\n\nIn previous rounds, the opponent’s totals tended to be lower when the threshold was low, but when the threshold is high the opponent might try for a higher total. Given that the opponent’s current upcard is only “4” (a very low card) and they are following an unchanging strategy, they will likely hit aggressively to come closer to 45. Standing with 34 is too far below the threshold and gives the opponent room to surpass you.\n\nThus, the optimal decision in this situation is to request an additional card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, you already have a total of 44 and the threshold is 45. With a Hit you must add one more point or more. Since the only safe card is an Ace (worth 1) and the chance of drawing an Ace from an infinite deck (with 13 equally likely ranks) is only 1\/13 (about 7.7%), you’d face a roughly 92.3% chance of immediately busting by drawing any card with a value greater than 1. Standing with 44 keeps you safely under the threshold while forcing your opponent’s strategy to work against a low starting card (the only known is a 4). Therefore, the best decision is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation, your total is 44 against a threshold of 45. If you hit, you have an extremely slim chance to receive an Ace (worth 1 point) so as not to exceed the threshold; drawing any other card would put you over the limit. In your previous rounds the opponent appears to hit several times, but in this round their visible card is only a 4. Although you might be tempted to try to reach 45, the risk of busting—nearly 12 out of 13 times if you hit—is far too great.\n\nThus, standing at 44 is the optimal move. By standing, you secure the best chance of winning the round given the opponent’s likely decision‐process and the dangerous risk of busting with an extra card.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis:\nAt a threshold (N) of 45 your current total is 44. Drawing one additional card (Hit) is very risky because almost every card except an Ace (worth 1 point) will cause your total to exceed 45. Since the infinite deck gives each card type roughly equal chance (about 1\/13 for any specific value), you’d only have around a 7.7% chance of drawing an Ace and getting exactly 45, while there’s over a 92% chance of busting. With your current total so close to the threshold, standing is the far more prudent choice.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current situation you’re in—with a total of 11 from your cards (3 and 8) and a threshold of 47—it is very advantageous to request another card. Your total is far from 47 and the risk of busting (going over 47) is extremely low at this point. Meanwhile, your opponent has a 7 showing, and from the record of previous rounds their play has generally led them to end up in the low-to-mid 40s when the threshold is 47. To try to outpace that, you need to be closer to 47, which means it’s best to take another card rather than standing now. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the game’s rules and the information from previous rounds, your current total of 16 is well below the threshold of 47. In past rounds the opponent has played in a way that usually builds a total in the 40s before stopping. With your total so far, it’s optimal to try to improve your hand rather than risk staying at 16, which is very unlikely to beat an opponent aiming near 43–47. Since you can safely take another card (the maximum card value is 13 and 16+13=29, which is still far from 47), taking a Hit gives you a chance to get closer to the threshold without risking an immediate bust. Therefore, based on both risk and past trends, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","We currently have a total of 26 while the limit is 47. Because the maximum card value (13 for a King) is far below the amount we can add without busting (47 – 26 = 21), drawing another card (Hit) carries no immediate risk of “busting.” Looking at previous rounds (especially rounds with a high threshold), your opponent’s final totals tended to be in the low-to-mid-40s when playing against higher N values, so you really want to get your total as close to 47 as possible to beat them. At only 26, standing now would almost certainly leave you at a disadvantage—even considering that the opponent has hidden cards, their moves in previous rounds suggest that they rarely reach the maximum safe total. Thus, the best play on your turn is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is 34 and the threshold is 47. Since the maximum card value in this game is 13, drawing any card will not make you bust (34 + 13 = 47, exactly at the threshold) and will only help you get closer to the target. Also, considering the opponent’s previous behavior where they tend to hit multiple times before standing, you want to boost your total as much as possible without exceeding the threshold. Under these conditions, the optimal choice is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current situation, our total is 36 while the threshold is 47. By taking another card there is roughly a 15% chance (drawing either a Queen or a King) to exceed the limit. In the other 85% of cases we would increase our total towards 47, which is clearly beneficial since the opponent in previous rounds has often settled in the 40‐range. In addition, because we have plenty of “room” to improve our score and the opponent’s strategy is fixed (they tend to push until reaching their “comfort zone”), the risk\/reward strongly favors drawing an additional card.\n\nThus, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation you’re in, your total is 39 with a threshold of 47. With no further knowledge of the opponent’s final total (though past rounds when N was 47 or close show them ending up around the low–to–mid 40s), standing at 39 would almost certainly fall short. Since you still have room to add up to 8 points (47 – 39 = 8) without exceeding the threshold, you have a chance to improve your total.\n\nHowever, you must be aware that only cards valued 1 (Ace) to 8 are “safe.” In an infinite deck where all 13 ranks are equally likely, drawing 8 or lower has a probability of 8\/13 (≈61.5%), while there is a roughly 38.5% chance of drawing 9 or above—a card that would bust you. Despite that risk, given that your current total is significantly below what is likely needed to beat the opponent, taking the risk (a “hit”) is justified.\n\nSo, even though there’s a risk of busting, the need to get closer to 47 and beat the probable opponent total means your correct move now is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is 43 and the threshold (N) is 47. This means that if you take another card (Hit), you need a card with a value of 4 or less (i.e. Ace = 1, 2, 3, or 4) in order not to exceed the threshold. With 13 card types equally likely, only 4 out of 13 outcomes (≈31%) will be safe, while the other 9 out of 13 outcomes (≈69%) will make you bust, immediately handing the win to your opponent.\n\nLooking at your opponent’s previous rounds when the threshold was high (e.g. Round 1 with N = 47 and Round 4 with N = 45), their final sum came out to 43. Their fixed strategy appears to bring them to around 43. In the current round many of the opponent’s cards remain hidden but given their history, it is likely they will end up with a similar total.\n\nTherefore, if you choose to stand at 43, it is highly likely that your opponent’s final total will be 43 as well. When both totals are the same, the rule is a draw (each score 0.5). On the other hand, risking a hit gives you only around a 31% chance to improve your total and win, while a bust (69% chance) results in a loss.\n\nWeighing both options, standing gives you a safer outcome (a draw worth 0.5 points) compared to the high risk of busting.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current situation, you only have a total of 9 (with cards '3' and '6') while the threshold for busting is 24. In order to be competitive and get as close to 24 without going over, you need to draw more cards. Although drawing additional cards comes with some risk, standing at 9 is very far from 24, and you have plenty of “room” left. In addition, the opponent’s upcard is a 6 and the other card is unknown, but since the opponent’s strategy is fixed and you are equipped with the record of previous rounds, it seems that the best course is to attempt to improve your position. Thus, the rational move at this point is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","We currently have a total of 14 with a threshold of 24. That means we still have a “safety gap” of 10 points before busting (since any drawn card valued 11 or more would bust us). In our deck the cards are uniformly one of 13 types (Ace = 1, cards 2–10, J = 11, Q = 12, K = 13), so only drawing a Jack, Queen or King (three out of 13 possibilities, roughly 23% chance) would put us over 24. With a 77% chance of drawing a safe card (adding between 1 and 10 points), the risk is acceptable to try to improve our total closer to the threshold. Given that our current opponent’s open card is a 6 and the opponent follows a fixed, unknown strategy, it is strategically better to hit and try to build a competitive total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our analysis, our total of 15 is well below the threshold 24. Given that drawing a card at 15 will improve our chance of getting closer to 24—and since we only bust if we draw a card of value 10 or higher (a probability of about 4⁄13, roughly 31%)—it is worth taking that risk. Standing on 15 when the opponent (whose strategy seems to push them toward higher totals) is likely seeking a total near 20 or more does not seem competitive. Therefore, the best move in this situation is to take another card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round, the threshold is 24 and your cards total 23. If you hit you risk going bust because the only safe card is an Ace (worth 1) – and that’s only about a 1\/13 chance. Standing at 23 gives you a reasonable chance to win if your opponent can’t get exactly 24 or ends up busting. Therefore, the optimal decision is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given the current round, your total is 23 and the threshold is 24. If you decide to hit, only an Ace (worth 1 point) would bring you safely to 24; any other card would put you over 24 and cause a bust. Since there’s only about a 1 in 13 chance (approximately 7.7%) of drawing an Ace from an infinite deck (where all 13 card types are equally likely), the risk of busting is overwhelmingly high if you hit at 23.\n\nAlso, looking at your opponent’s play in previous rounds, they seem to take extra hits until they’re very close to the threshold. With a threshold of 24, the opponent’s risk tolerance is likely lower—they will try to get as close as possible without busting. If you stand at 23, you force the opponent to beat that number, and given the slim margin, they face a tough gamble as well.\n\nThus, with your current total at 23 and knowing that hitting carries a roughly 92% chance of busting, the optimal move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on our current total of 11 (with cards 3 and 8) and a relatively low threshold of 28, there is plenty of room to safely improve our hand. In previous rounds, our opponent’s strategy generally appears to be conservative until getting closer to the threshold. With only the Q (worth 12 points) revealed and an unknown card in the opponent’s hand, we have no clear evidence that our opponent is already very close to 28. In our case, having 11 we are very far from the limit, and proceeding with a hit will allow us to build a stronger total that might outpace the opponent’s eventual score. Therefore, the best move is to “Hit.”\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is 21 and the threshold is 28. If you stand, you will be 7 points away from 28 and likely be outdistanced if your opponent is able to safely improve their sum (as seen in similar rounds). On the other hand, if you hit, you have a 7\/13 (approximately 54%) chance to draw a “safe” card (Ace through 7) that will bring your total closer to 28. For example, drawing a 7 gives you exactly 28, while drawing a lower value still improves your proximity to 28 relative to standing with 21. Although there is a risk (about 46% chance) of drawing 8 or higher—which would result in going over 28 and likely losing—the benefit of increasing your total from 21 to a better contesting value seems to outweigh the risk given the opponent’s fixed strategy and the previous round outcomes. \n\nThus, the optimal move in this round is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current situation, our total is 16 and the threshold is 34. Since there is no risk of busting with just one additional card (the maximum card value is 13, which would bring us to 29), it’s beneficial to try and get closer to the threshold. Moreover, our opponent’s revealed card is a Jack (11), and with one unknown card remaining, we have limited information. However, our own total is quite low relative to 34. In similar past rounds, the optimal strategy when far below the threshold has been to hit until you have a strong chance of reaching closer to the maximum without exceeding it. \n\nTherefore, the recommended move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is only 19 when the threshold is 34. Even if you get the highest‐value card (K, worth 13), you’ll only reach 32, which is still safely under the threshold. Meanwhile, the opponent’s visible card is a J (11) and they follow a fixed “hit until near threshold” strategy. With your low total, standing now would likely leave you far behind. Without any risk of busting on this hit, you have the chance to improve your total closer to 34. Therefore, the best move is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation we can analyze the decision as follows:\n\n• Our total is 27 and the threshold is 34 – we are 7 points away, so we are quite far from pushing the limit. \n• Drawing another card means that if its value is 7 or lower (Ace–7) our new total will remain within the limit (between 28 and 34). If the drawn card is 8 or more (8, 9, 10, J, Q, K), our sum will exceed 34 and we lose immediately. Assuming all 13 card types are equally likely, about 7 out of 13 outcomes (roughly 54%) would be safe and 6 out of 13 (about 46%) would bust. \n• Moreover, looking at the opponent’s fixed strategy in previous rounds, it appears that they tend to take extra cards (hit) early on. Although we cannot know their hidden cards exactly, it is quite possible that they will achieve a total in the 28–34 range unless they hit a bust themselves.\n• With our current score (27) it seems a bit too low when the target is 34. The chance of safely increasing our total (and potentially reaching near 34) is slightly better than not, and doing so increases our chance to win provided we do not bust.\n• Given these factors, the optimal decision is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation:\n• The threshold N is 39.\n• Your current total is only 6 (with an Ace worth 1 and a 5).\n• Since you have plenty of room to draw without risking bust (exceeding 39) and your total is much lower than the target, it makes sense to improve your hand.\n• Meanwhile, the opponent’s visible card is a 10, and although their unknown card might add a modest total, you are already at a significant disadvantage if you stand at 6.\n\nTherefore, to increase your chance of getting closer to 39 while staying safe, you should choose to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the game board and rules, your current total is 12 – much lower than the threshold of 39. Since you must get close to 39 without going over, staying at 12 gives you almost no chance of beating an opponent who typically builds a total in the 20–40 range. In previous rounds, the opponent’s strategy has generally led them to hit until they are in a competitive total relative to the threshold. Therefore, to have any realistic chance of winning this round, you need to take an extra card.\n\nThus, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round’s situation we have a lot of room to move (our total is only 21 while the threshold is 39). Unlike rounds where we risk going bust, drawing any card now—even a high one (since face cards count as 11, 12, or 13)—will still keep us under 39. Considering that our opponent is also drawing and could be trying to get closer to 39, we want to improve our total without risking a bust. With our current total of 21, a hit is safe and necessary to compete. Therefore, our recommended move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is 27 while the target threshold is 39. With another card you have a 12\/13 chance to get a value between 1 and 12—which would bring your total to between 28 and 39—and only a 1\/13 chance (drawing a King worth 13) of exceeding the threshold. Given that the probability of busting is low and you need to improve your total to be competitive against an opponent whose fixed strategy usually pushes for higher totals, the best move is to request an additional card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current score of 19 (with the threshold being 37) and seeing that our total is far from the limit while the opponent’s upcard is only 5, it is important for us to improve our total to have a realistic chance of beating the opponent. Given the earlier rounds and the fixed strategy our opponent has been following, standing at 19 would be too low even if the opponent turns out to have a poor hidden card. It’s therefore most reasonable to request another card (hit) to get closer to 37 without immediately risking busting. \n\nAnswer: Hit","The safe margin from 25 to the threshold of 37 is 12 points, and in our scoring system only drawing a K (worth 13) would immediately bust us (a roughly 1\/13 chance). All other cards will improve our total without busting. Given that our opponent’s only visible card is a 5 and considering their history of playing aggressively until they near the threshold, it is advantageous to take the small risk and hit in order to increase our total to closer to 37. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our situation we currently have a total of 28 while the game threshold is 37. In order to win (or at least draw) when the final values are compared, we want to be as close to 37 as possible without going over. With a margin of 9 points left, if we choose to hit our chance of “busting” (i.e. drawing a card whose value would push the total over 37) is only if we draw a card of value 10 or higher. In our deck that happens with probability 4\/13 (there are four risky values: 10, J, Q, K), while there’s a 9\/13 chance of drawing a safe card (values 1 through 9) that would improve our position. In a previous round when the available “room” was very tight we refrained from hitting; however, here we have plenty of room for improvement. Raising our total closer to 37 significantly improves our chance to outdistance our opponent without busting. Therefore, taking into account the risk\/reward considerations and our knowledge of the game rules and prior rounds, the best move at this moment is to request an additional card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our analysis, your current total is 33 with a threshold (N) of 37. If you hit, you risk drawing any card valued 5 or higher—which happens 9 out of 13 times—leading to an immediate bust (exceeding 37). Only drawing one of {A (1), 2, 3, 4} keeps you safe.\n\nGiven the high probability (roughly 70%) of busting and the fact that 33 is already within a safe margin, it is better to avoid the risk and stand. Standing gives you a final score of 33, and then the opponent (with his unknown cards and fixed strategy) must try to beat that without busting. Overall, the risk of worsening your position by hitting far outweighs the potential benefit.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current situation, your total is 33 while the threshold is 37. That gives you only a 4‐point cushion before you “bust” by going over 37. In order to hit safely, you would have to draw one of only the low‐value cards (Ace [value 1], 2, 3, or 4); assuming a uniform chance among the 13 possible card types, that’s only a roughly 31% chance to stay safe. Meanwhile, standing at 33 avoids a potentially immediate bust. Although a total of 33 isn’t very close to 37, the risk of going over when drawing is high and your opponent (based on previous rounds) has already taken several cards and remains in play. Taking that risk and drawing is likely to do more harm than good in this situation. Therefore, the best decision is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

It’s extremely unlikely that drawing one more card at this point will cause us to exceed 48, and getting closer to 48 is key to winning. Therefore, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the game board and rules, your current total is only 6 while the threshold is 48. With such a low total you are far from approaching the limit, and there is almost no risk of busting on your next hit. Moreover, since your opponent has already taken a hit and has two cards (one known as '2' and two unknown cards), they may be accumulating a total closer to 48. To maximize your chance of winning by reaching a higher total without busting, you should continue taking a card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, your hand totals only 10 while the target is 48. With such a low total it is very safe to request another card. There is virtually no risk of going over 48 (even if a king valued at 13 is drawn, your total would only rise to 23), and hitting gives you a great opportunity to approach the target without exposing you to any significant bust risk. Meanwhile, your opponent’s play isn’t fully revealed, but given the two rounds already played (both having hit twice), it is likely they are also trying to build a better total. In order to have a strong chance at getting closer to 48 than them, your best move now is to ask for another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the information you provided, your current total is 18, while the threshold N is 48. Since you are far from the risk of exceeding 48—especially given that the highest card value is 13—it’s safe (and likely advantageous) to request another card. Moreover, your opponent, who has already taken three hits, is following a fixed strategy, and with your current score on the lower side, taking a hit improves your chance of getting closer to 48 without busting. \n\nTherefore, the best move in this situation is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","We have a relatively low total (26) compared to the threshold (48) and plenty of room to move closer to a winning total. Since the maximum card value is 13, adding another card will not risk busting immediately (26+13 = 39 still safely below 48). The main goal is to come as near as possible to 48 without exceeding it—getting more points than your opponent. Given the fixed opponent strategy and the fact that you have plenty of margin for improvement, the advisable move is to request an additional card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current game situation:\n• Your total is 27, and the threshold is 48.\n• Since all cards come from an infinite deck where the highest possible card is 13, a hit now cannot result in a bust (27 + 13 = 40 < 48).\n• With so much room remaining, getting closer to the threshold increases your chance to be closer than the opponent when settlement occurs.\n• Therefore, it is optimal to ask for one more card at Turn 6.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is 40 with a threshold of 48. You still have an 8‐point margin before busting. Drawing one more card (hitting) gives you roughly an 8\/13 (about 61.5%) chance of adding a card with a value between 1 and 8⁠—improving your total to somewhere between 41 and 48—and a 5\/13 (about 38.5%) chance of busting if the card is worth 9 or more. Since you’re still 8 points short of the threshold and your opponent’s cards are largely unknown (with only the “2” revealed), you would likely benefit from attempting to improve your total. This means that “Hit” is the optimum decision in this round to get closer to 48, thereby increasing your chance to beat your opponent.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, your current total is 17 and the threshold (N) is 31. With the rules in this game, every card drawn has a value between 1 and 13. This means that even if you happen to draw the highest value card (a King worth 13), your new total will be 17 + 13 = 30, which is still under the threshold of 31. In other words, there is no risk of “busting” on this hit.\n\nSince being as close as possible to the threshold gives you the best chance of winning (while still staying below 31), and considering that your opponent’s strategy is fixed but their second card remains unknown, the best move is to hit now to improve your total. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on an assessment of the situation, you currently have a total of 20 while the threshold is 31. If you choose to hit, you add a new card; however, you risk busting if the card’s value is too high. With the card values provided, drawing a Q (worth 12) or a K (worth 13) would put you over 31 (giving 32 or 33), and those are the only cards that cause you to bust on a hit from 20. Out of 13 equally likely cards from an infinite deck, 11 cards (Ace through 10 plus J) would be safe, giving you totals between 21 and 31. (In fact, note that drawing a J gives you exactly 31; drawing the other cards gives you numbers lower than 31.) This means you have an approximately 84.6% chance of improving your position and only about a 15.4% chance of busting. \n\nMoreover, your opponent shows a Q (12) and his overall strategy has been to hit when his total is low relative to the threshold. Since you know his approach from previous rounds and considering the threshold of 31, you likely need to take some risk to improve your total and outdistance him. \n\nTherefore, with a risk of busting on a hit being relatively low and the potential to get closer to 31 (or hit it exactly with a J), it is optimal to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round—with a threshold of 45 and your hand totaling only 19—it is very unlikely that you are in danger of busting with another card, while you still have plenty of headroom to approach 45. Waiting on 19 would almost certainly let the opponent (with one face-up Q and a hidden card) build a higher sum. Also, the history shows that even if the opponent takes many cards (as in round 1) or stops early (as in round 2), your current low total makes it advisable to increase your sum closer to the threshold. Therefore, the best move is to request an additional card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the board and rules, you are currently at 21 while the game’s threshold is 45. Since even the highest‐valued card (which is 13 for a King) added to 21 (total = 34) will still be safe, there is no immediate risk of busting. Moreover, because the opponent’s displayed card is a Q (12 points) and their other cards remain unknown, you want to improve your total to be as close as possible to 45 without overshooting. In previous rounds the opponent appeared to hit repeatedly until reaching a high amount (often overshooting but forcing draws when both exceed the threshold). With your total so far far below 45, it makes sense to continue to “hit” so you can build a higher total. Therefore, the best move is to request another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total (23) with a safe margin until 45 and the fact that drawing any single card (all values being 13 or lower) still keeps you well under the threshold, it is safe to request another card. With an infinite deck and having room to improve your score against the opponent’s likely plan, your best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on analyzing our current total of 26 (with cards 7, Q, 2, 2, 3) and the threshold of 45, we are in a safe position to ask for an additional card. Even if the worst-case additional value (i.e. a King of 13) is drawn, our total would become 39, which is still safely below the threshold. Meanwhile, our opponent’s play suggests that they tend to hit several times to try to reach closer to the threshold. Staying at 26 could leave us too far behind if the opponent improves their sum. Therefore, to maximize our likelihood of winning the round (by getting as close to 45 as possible without busting), the best move at turn 4 is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Let’s review the situation. In the current round, the threshold N is 45 and you already have a total of 36. To remain safe, you must not exceed 45. That means the next card must be 9 or less (since 36 + 9 = 45) in order to avoid “busting.” Looking at the card values, the cards that are “safe” to hit with are Ace (1), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Out of the 13 card types (A,2,…,10, J, Q, K), 9 types keep you under the limit while the 4 remaining types (10, J, Q, K) would push your total past 45.\n\nThat gives you roughly a 9\/13 chance (about 69%) to improve your total without busting – if you hit, your total could end up anywhere between 37 and 45, getting you closer to the threshold. Standing with 36 would likely leave you too far from 45 compared to your opponent’s potential improvement (especially given that your opponent already has the queen showing and has been hitting aggressively).\n\nBecause the safe probability is relatively high and you still have some margin to catch up to the optimal total without busting, the best course of action is to request another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation the player is in, the total is 42 and the threshold is 45. If you choose to hit you risk drawing a card that will push your score over 45. Only drawing an Ace (1), a 2, or a 3 lets you remain safe—giving you a total of 43, 44, or 45 respectively—while drawing any card with a value of 4 or higher will immediately exceed the threshold and cause you to lose the round. With an infinite deck assumed to produce roughly 1\/13 for each of the 13 equally likely card values, only about 3 out of 13 draws are “safe” (roughly a 23% chance). At the same time, the opponent (who already chose to stand) has set their total already, and we do not know what it is; however, if they are already at or above your 42 then getting closer to 45 could be advantageous for them. Given the high risk of busting if you hit (nearly 77% chance) contrasted with the risk of merely “losing” by a small margin if you stand, the safer and strategically more sound move is to stand. \n\nAnswer: Stand","Let's analyze the situation:\n\n•   Your current total is 21, which is well below the threshold of 48.  \n•   Any card drawn (minimum value is 1 and maximum is 13) will keep you safely under 48 (even a 13 would bring you to 34).  \n•   Obtaining additional cards will allow you to get closer to 48 and improve your chances of beating your opponent.  \n•   Given the opponent’s fixed approach in previous rounds – where they tend to hit until they’re close to the threshold – maximizing your total without busting is beneficial.\n\nTherefore, the best move in this situation is to take another card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, here’s our reasoning:\n\n• Your current hand is ['K', '8', 'K'] which totals 34 points. With a threshold of 48, you have 14 points of “room” before you would exceed 48.\n• Any additional card you draw has a value between 1 (Ace) and 13 (K). Even if you draw the highest‐valued card (K = 13), your total would become 34 + 13 = 47, which is still under the threshold.\n• Standing at 34 would leave you far from the limit, and your opponent, already having a visible Q (worth 12), may reach a higher total with further plays.\n• Since you’re safely within the margin (a “hit” cannot bust you this turn) and you need to close the gap in order to be competitive, the optimal decision is to hit.\n\nThus, in this situation you should hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round:\n• Your total is 45 with a threshold N of 48.\n• Drawing an extra card (hit) will only be safe if you draw an Ace (value 1), 2, or 3 – that’s 3 good cards out of 13. The other 10 cards would cause you to exceed 48 and lose.\n• Since you’re already very close to 48, the risk is high (roughly 77% chance to bust) if you hit.\n• Also, although the opponent’s details are partially unknown, the records and fixed strategy indicate they tend to draw repeatedly until they near the threshold. With a strong hand like 45 in a 48-run game, it’s safer to avoid the huge bust risk.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current situation, your hand is only 6 and the threshold is 39. With plenty of room below 39, you are in no danger of “busting” and need more points to have a chance against the opponent—even though one of their cards is hidden, they started with an Ace and will likely try to reach as high as possible before stopping. Given that you have a very low total relative to the threshold, it is in your best interest to take an additional card. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is 8 (from A[1] + 5 + 2), and the threshold is 39. Since you are far from reaching 39 and there is very little risk of busting, it is advisable to request another card. In addition, even though your opponent’s second and third cards are unknown, you still have plenty of room to improve your hand without jeopardizing your chances.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given your current total is 11, which is very far from the threshold of 39, and every card drawn (with a maximum of 13 points) will not risk an immediate bust, it is advisable to continue drawing more cards. Moreover, to compete against an opponent whose face‐down cards and strategy remain uncertain, you need to accumulate a closer total to 39. Therefore, in this situation, the optimal move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current total of 20 (with plenty of room before reaching 39) and knowing that the deck only gives cards with values at most 13 (so no immediate risk of busting), it’s optimal to take one more card. Even though the opponent’s hidden cards aren’t known, we infer from previous rounds that they tend to push their totals up, and being at 20 would put us at a disadvantage if we stopped now. (Remember, in this game you win by coming closer to the threshold without going over, so having a lower total than the opponent is very risky.) Therefore, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 22 (with card values 1, 5, 2, 3, 9, 2) and the threshold of 39, there is no risk of immediate bust because even if you draw the highest‐value card (K = 13), your new total would be 35 (22 + 13), which is still under 39. Since you want to be as close as possible to the threshold without going over and because your opponent’s fixed strategy suggests they may push their total into a higher range, it is in your best interest to improve your hand.\n\nThus, the optimal decision for Turn 5 is to request another card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round, your total is 28 and the threshold is 39. You have 11 points to work with before busting. Since only cards of value 12 (Queen) or 13 (King) would put you over 39 (a probability of 2\/13, or roughly 15%), you have about an 85% chance to get a “safe” card. In addition, knowing that the opponent already stood on turn 5 (and given their past behavior and fixed strategy) it makes it very likely that their total is higher than 28. To improve your chances of coming closer to 39 (and thus beating the opponent’s likely total), you should continue drawing a card now despite the small bust risk.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, your total is 32 while the threshold is 39. You need to get much closer to 39 in order to beat your opponent’s likely final total. Drawing another card (Hit) will give you an extra value between 1 and 13. However, if the extra card is more than 7 then 32 + card exceeds 39 and you “bust.” Since the possible safe draws (values 1–7) have a chance of 7\/13 (about 54%) and would bring your total to between 33 and 39 (with an average near 36), your chances of getting a competitive (or even winning) total are significantly improved compared to standing on 32. Given that the opponent has already stopped, they seem to have secured a moderately high total (based on previous rounds of their fixed strategy). With your current total, it is best to take the risk and hit to try to close that 7‐point gap.\n\nThus, the recommended action in this round is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation you only have 8 points (6+2) while the threshold is 47. With so much room to grow, the risk of busting is extremely low. In contrast, the opponent’s visible card is a 10 and we know nothing about the hidden card, and the opponent’s strategy from previous rounds indicates that they usually take more cards until nearing the threshold. Since you are far below the threshold, the best move is to ask for an additional card (\"Hit\") so that you can build a stronger total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your current total is only 13 and the threshold is 47, you have a large margin before risking a bust. The worst possible card draw is a King (value 13), which would bring you to 26 (still very safe). Since you need to reach as close to 47 as possible (without going over) to beat the opponent—whose face-up card is 10 and whose hidden cards are unknown—it is advisable to improve your hand. Therefore, the optimal move in this situation is to request another card:\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 23 and the fact that even the highest possible card (13) would only bring your total to 36—still well under the threshold 47—it is very safe to request an additional card. Given that the opponent’s strategy has been to hit on the first two turns regardless and your own total is significantly below the stopping point, you can take the extra card without much risk of busting. Therefore, the best action is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our situation, you have a total of 36 when the threshold is 47. This means you have an 11‑point gap before you would exceed the threshold. If you hit, any card drawn with a value of 11 or below (that is, Ace through 10 and the Jack which is 11) will keep you safe, while only drawing a Queen (12) or a King (13) will cause you to bust. That’s roughly a 2⁄13 chance (about 15%) to bust and an 11⁄13 chance to improve your total closer to the threshold.\n\nAt 36 points you are below ideal compared to the opponent’s likely total built up from a visible 10 and three unknown cards. Accounting for the relatively low bust risk and the need to close the gap towards 47, the more sensible option is to hit and try to get closer to the threshold while still leaving a safety margin.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round situation it is best not to risk busting. Your total is 41 with a maximum safe pull of 6 (since any card 7 or above would push you over the threshold of 47). Given that only 6 out of 13 card values (Ace through 6) will improve your score safely while 7 out of 13 will bust, the risk of hitting is quite high. Even though a successful hit can raise your total closer to the threshold (giving you 42–47), the more than 50% chance of busting outweighs that potential benefit. In addition, your opponent has already stopped his draws so his total is fixed, and by standing with 41 you preserve your current position rather than gambling on a slender 46% chance for an improvement.\n\nThus, the best action right now is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given that your current total is only 8 with a threshold of 37, you have plenty of room to safely draw additional cards. Standing now would leave you far from reaching 37, which is the optimal target in this round. Also, while the opponent’s visible card is a 10, their second card is unknown and their fixed strategy has been consistent in attempting to get close to N without busting. Therefore, your best course of action is to hit and try to build your total closer to 37.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is only 9 with a threshold of 37, which gives you plenty of room to safely draw more cards. Standing now is almost certain to result in a loss given that you would be very far from the threshold, and the opponent’s visible card (10) suggests they might build a high total. Reviewing the past rounds shows that both sides tend to hit several times in order to approach the threshold as closely as possible without “busting” (exceeding N). With such a low total, the optimal strategy is to request another card (Hit) to build a competitive total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given your current hand totals only 19 out of an allowable 37, every single card is “safe” because even the highest value (King=13) raises you to only 32, which is still below the threshold. Furthermore, waiting (standing) at 19 would leave you far from the target, making it easy for your opponent to win if they manage to hit a higher total without busting. Based on the records, the opponent's fixed strategy shows that they tend to hit aggressively early on. Therefore, increasing your total as much as possible is crucial. The best move is to take another card, which means you should Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current total of 21 versus a threshold of 37—and having only received three hits so far—it is very unlikely that our hand will bust with one additional card because even the highest card (K = 13) would only bring our total to 34. In contrast, if we stand now at 21, it is almost certain that the opponent (with a visible 10 and following his fixed strategy) will try to get closer to 37. Considering the remaining “room” (37 – 21 = 16), the risk of busting on one hit is essentially nil (since no card exceeds 16) and the potential to build a much stronger total is high. Therefore, hitting at this point is the optimal decision.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your current total is 22 with a threshold (N) of 37, you have a comfortable margin because even the highest possible card (with value 13) would only bring your total to 35, which is safely below 37. With no immediate risk of busting on a hit, you can improve your total toward 37 without danger. Since your opponent’s consistent strategy in previous rounds shows that they tend to hit early and then stand, it is optimal for you to hit now and work toward a higher total to have a better chance of winning.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current total of 24 and the threshold being 37, we still have a safe margin of 13 points. Because every possible card drawn (with possible values 1 through 13) will keep our total at or below 37 (24 + 13 = 37), there is zero risk of busting on our next card. Moreover, since our current total is relatively low compared to the threshold, hitting gives us the opportunity to improve our position—moving closer to 37—without risking exceeding it.\n\nIn addition, the opponent already stopped on turn 5, meaning that they won’t take any further cards this round. Our goal is to get as close as possible to 37, so it is advantageous for us to hit rather than stand with a total of 24, which is quite far from 37. Therefore, the best move in this situation is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the rules and the current situation:\n\n• Your hand totals 36 and the threshold (N) is 37. Getting a card will give you a chance to reach 37 only if you receive an Ace (worth 1), as any other card (minimum value 2) will push you over 37 (i.e. 36 + 2 = 38, busting your hand).\n\n• With an infinite deck having 13 equally likely card types, the chance to draw an Ace is only about 1 in 13 (roughly 7.7%). In contrast, there’s over a 92% chance of busting if you hit.\n\n• Although standing at 36 might be slightly lower than an “ideal” 37, your opponent (seeing similar plays in earlier rounds with roughly similar thresholds) is likely to have already stopped with a total that is similar—often around 36 or even 37. In many previous rounds the opponent chose to stand while keeping their total as high as possible without the risk of busting.\n\n• Thus, hitting risks an almost 92% chance to bust (automatic loss) to try to improve from 36 to 37, whereas standing secures a safe outcome that may lead to a draw (or win if the opponent’s total turns out below yours). Even in a scenario where the opponent ends with 37, hitting only gives you roughly a 7.7% chance to force a tie while standing would simply lose if you were behind. Given the poor odds for a “safe” draw from hitting, the risk outweighs the potential benefit.\n\nSo, the optimal play in turn 7 is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current situation and our analysis:\n• Our hand totals only 14 while the round’s threshold is 37. We are far from reaching the limit.\n• Even drawing the highest card (K worth 13) would only bring us to 27, still safely below 37.\n• The opponent’s visible card is a 10 and we have no precise knowledge about their face‐down card, but looking at previous rounds the opponent seems inclined to “hit” until reaching a higher sum (even sometimes overshooting). \n• To have any chance to get close to 37 (and beat or compete with the opponent), we must increase our total.\nThus, our best move is to request another card, i.e. choose “Hit.”\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on what we know, your current total is 21 and the limit (N) is 37. Since adding any card (the highest‐value card is a King worth 13) would give you at most 34, you’re completely safe from busting this round. In the past rounds the opponent’s fixed play (even starting with a 10 up) has resulted in them often “overshooting” or ending up with a total that is too close—or even over—the threshold. In your case, you can improve your chances by increasing your hand total while still being safely under 37.\n\nTherefore, the best move now is to take another card (Hit), and then later decide based on your new total whether to risk additional hits or to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 30 (with your cards ['7', '7', '7', '9'] summing to 30) and knowing that the threshold is 37, you’re 7 points away from the limit. A “safe” additional card must have a value of 7 or less (since 30 + 7 = 37), and there are 7 safe card values (A(1), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7) out of 13 possible card types. That gives you about a 53.8% chance of drawing a card that brings you to a total between 31 and 37 – a strong progress toward winning against an opponent who, in previous rounds at a similar threshold, has tended to risk additional hits to get close to or even exceed the limit. Remaining at 30 would leave you significantly behind what the opponent is likely aiming for. \n\nThus, taking the risk is justified since a safe hit would greatly improve your standing while hoping to avoid going over 37. In other words, you should opt to \"hit\" on Turn 3.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation you have a total of 2 from two Aces and the threshold is very high (48). Looking at previous rounds, your opponent’s strategy has been fixed and tends to chase high totals—even if that sometimes causes them to overshoot. In contrast, you are far below the threshold and can safely request additional cards without risking an immediate bust.\n\nGiven that your current total of 2 leaves you with a lot of room to build up toward a competitive total (especially since the opponent is likely to push aggressively), the recommended move is to take a card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the game situation and rules, you currently have a total of 15 with cards ['A', 'A', 'K'] (with Ace counted as 1 each and King as 13). With the threshold set at 48 this round and considering that the opponent’s visible card is a 9 (with two hidden cards), your total is far from what you would ideally want to be close to 48 (or at least competitive against the opponent’s potential total). In previous rounds the opponent often keeps drawing until reaching a value that risks exceeding the threshold, but you already have a safe margin since 15 is very low relative to 48—it is unlikely you will immediately bust if you take another card. Therefore, in order to work towards a total closer to 48, the most logical move is to request another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your total is only 24 while the threshold is 48, you have a considerable margin before busting. Any card you draw now (with a maximum value of 13) cannot make you exceed the threshold on this hit. Since you need to get closer to 48 to win—especially when considering the opponent’s unknown cards—you should safely draw another card. \n\nThus, the optimal decision is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the rules, your current total is 34 and the threshold is 48. Since the opponent’s visible card is a 9 and you’re 14 points away from 48, you have no risk of busting by taking one more card (even the highest‐value card, a K worth 13, would bring you to 47). In this situation it is best to \"hit\" to try to come closer to 48 without exceeding it. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current round we have a total of 41 with N = 48, meaning we’re 7 points away from the threshold. If we choose to stand at 41 the opponent (whose visible card is “9”) may—with his fixed strategy—likely continue to hit in search of a higher score. (Looking back, for a round with threshold 48 his behavior has sometimes tended to push his total high enough to challenge us or even “bust” but then cause a draw if we both go over.) \n\nOn the other hand, if we hit we have about a 7\/13 chance (roughly 54%) drawing a “safe” card (one with a value 7 or less, since adding 8 or higher would push us over 48) and improving our total to something between 42 and 48. Especially if we pick up a 7, our total reaches 48—the best finish possible. However, the risk is that with nearly 46% probability we could bust immediately. \n\nConsidering that our current total of 41 is significantly below the maximum and that we are in a pivotal round (round 9\/10) with 6 points so far, it is better to try and improve our hand. Even though there is a noticeable bust risk, the chance to get closer to 48 (and perhaps beat the opponent’s final hand) outweighs the risk of standing on what appears to be a mediocre total.\n\nTherefore, the best course according to the game rules, our current board information, and the opponent’s past behavior is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation:\n• The threshold N is 24, and you currently have 14.\n• You have a safety margin of 10 points before busting, but only safe cards (Ace through 10) can be drawn without busting.\n• If you stand at 14 you’ll be far from the target and likely lose since your opponent might already have (or reach) a strong total.\n• The risk of busting on one hit is roughly 3\/13 (since drawing any face card – J, Q, or K – will put you over 24), which is under 25%.\n• In almost all previous rounds you needed to hit several times in order to get close to N; with only 14, you are very far from 24.\n\nSo, to maximize your chance of reaching a near-optimal total and still having room to hit if necessary, you should choose to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round, the threshold is 24 and your total is 16. Since your hand is quite far from the maximum limit, there’s room to safely improve your total. Drawing a new card gives you a chance to raise your total into the 17–24 range without busting if you pull an Ace through 8 (which occur with a probability of 8\/13). On the other hand, if you stand at 16, you risk being beaten by your opponent’s likely improvement (especially since their face‐up card is a Q valued at 12). Although there is a roughly 5\/13 chance to draw a card that will bust you (if you get a 9, 10, J, Q, or K), the higher possibility (8\/13) to safely improve makes the risk worthwhile when you are so far from 24. Therefore, the optimal choice is to take another card – Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","In the current round, your total is exactly N (24). Since any additional card (even the smallest, an Ace worth 1) would put you above 24 and guarantee a bust, it is optimal to play conservatively and stand. \n\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Since busting isn’t a concern when your current total plus any card (maximum 13) is still well below 49, you have plenty of room to safely take another card. In order to get closer to the target without risking an immediate bust, the best play is to take a Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the rules and our current total, we are far from the threshold 49. With 21 points, a hit will add at most 13 (if a K is drawn) to reach 34, which is still well within safe bounds. Since our goal is to get as close to 49 as possible without overshooting and our sum is relatively low, it’s optimal to take another card at this stage. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Considering that your current total is 28 and the threshold is 49, there is no risk of exceeding 49 by drawing one more card (even if the highest card, K or 13, is drawn, you would reach only 41). In order to get closer to 49 and beat the opponent (who is also hitting), it is optimal to request another card at this stage.\n\nAnswer: Hit","We are currently at a total of 39, and the limit is 49. In our deck there are 13 ranks: an Ace worth 1, numbers 2–10 at their face value, and J, Q, K worth 11, 12, and 13, respectively. If we hit, our card will add to our total. The bust condition occurs if our total goes over 49. Since 39 + X > 49 when X > 10, we bust on drawing a J, Q, or K (11, 12, 13), which happens with a probability of 3\/13 (approximately 23%). In all other cases (drawing an Ace through a 10, which is 10\/13 chance) our new total will lie between 40 and 49 – a significant improvement over our current 39.\n\nConsidering that our opponent has already hit three times and his strategy is fixed (likely aiming to get as close to 49 as possible), standing at 39 does not put us in a strong position. By hitting, we have a favorable probability (roughly 77%) to improve our hand while risking a bust only about 23% of the time.\n\nThus, the optimal move in this situation is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analyzing the situation:\n• Your card list is ['6', 'J', '4', '7', 'J', 'J'], which totals 50 (6 + 11 + 4 + 7 + 11 + 11 = 50).\n• The threshold (N) is 49, so your total already exceeds N.\n• According to the rules, if you exceed N and your opponent does not, you lose; however, if both exceed N, the round results in a draw.\n• Since your total is already over the threshold (50 > 49), requesting another card (“Hit”) won’t change your status—it can only worsen your total.\n• Therefore, the optimal decision in this turn is to “Stand” and hope your opponent also busts (or exceeds N), leading to at worst a draw.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given your current total of 6 (from “5” and “A”), you’re very far away from the threshold of 37. With such a low total, you’re at little risk of busting immediately, and you need to accumulate a higher score to have a chance to beat the opponent—especially considering their face‐up “K”. Therefore, the optimal move in this situation is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation:\n• The threshold (N) is 37.\n• Your current total is 8 (cards: 5, A = 1, and 2).\n• With 8 points, you are very far from the limit. Drawing another card cannot immediately cause you to exceed 37 (the worst possible card has a value of 13, which would bring your total to 21).\n• Knowing that your opponent follows a fixed strategy (and in the previous round always hit), you have a clear advantage by safely trying to build your score closer to 37.\nThus, the best move at this point is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 17 with a threshold of 37, there is no risk of busting on an immediate hit (even the maximum card of value 13 would only bring you to 30). Since you are far from 37, it is strategically favorable to hit in order to improve your position relative to the dealer’s likely progress. Therefore, at Turn 3 your optimal move is Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round information:\n• Your total is 24 with a threshold of 37. That gives you a safe headroom of 13 points (37 – 24 = 13).\n• Since every card in the deck has a value from 1 to 13 (with K being 13 as the maximum), any additional card you draw will not immediately bust you.\n• Given that your opponent’s fixed strategy from round 1 has him hitting every turn, it’s reasonable to expect that he will continue to try to get close to or even over-threshold. Standing at 24 would put you at a significant disadvantage.\n• Thus, to improve your chance of coming closer to 37 and winning the settlement after the opponent stops, you should request another card now.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, your total is 35 with a threshold of 37. If you hit, only drawing a card that adds 1 (Ace, which makes 36) or a 2 (which gives you exactly 37) will keep you safe; any card 3 or higher will push your total over 37 and instantly cause you to bust. Since there are 13 possible card types and only 2 safe ones, the chance of staying in the game is only 2⁄13 (about 15%), while there’s an 11⁄13 (85%) chance of busting.\n\nMeanwhile, if you stand at 35 your total remains as is. Although 35 is not exactly as high as 37—and may lose against an opponent who managed to reach a 36 or 37—it is far safer than risking an immediate bust with a hit under these odds.\n\nThus, given the high risk (over 80% chance to bust) when hitting, the best strategy is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation, your total is only 16 while the threshold is 44. With an infinite deck where all card values are at most 13, you are very safe to draw since even the highest‐value card will only bring you to 29 (16 + 13), which is still far from busting. In order to be competitive against your opponent and get closer to the target threshold, you need to increase your total. Therefore, the optimal move in this turn is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is only 21 while the threshold is 44. Since the maximum value of any card is 13, even if you were dealt the highest card (13), your total would become 34 (which is still safely below 44). In other words, there is no risk of busting by hitting, and you can improve your hand to be closer to the threshold without danger. Also, given you need to beat your opponent (and the opponent is likely to try to maximize their score within the threshold), you should try to have as high a total as possible. Therefore, you should choose to Hit now.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, your total is only 26 with a threshold of 44. Since you have plenty of room for improvement and the opponent’s strategy tends to push them to higher totals (often risking a bust), it makes sense to increase your total to be competitive. By hitting now you can safely aim closer to the threshold without an extreme risk of overshooting. Therefore, the best move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, your current total is 33 while the threshold is 44. You have room for improvement but also must avoid busting by exceeding 44. When you add a card, any card with value 12 or 13 (Q or K) will bust you (33 + 12 = 45, 33 + 13 = 46). That amounts to a roughly 15% chance (2 out of 13 cards) of busting on the next hit. On the other hand, 11 of the 13 cards (values 1 through 11) will keep you safe, and they also help move your total closer to the 44 needed to beat the opponent in the endgame. Given that your current total (33) is well below the threshold and the opponent will likely try to get close as well, you need to improve your hand. The expected benefit of drawing another card outweighs the moderate risk of busting. Therefore, the recommended move in this situation is to ask for another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\nOur total is 40 when the threshold is 44. That leaves us only a margin of 4 points. In order to hit safely, the card drawn must be 4 or less (since Ace = 1, then 2, 3, or 4). With an infinite deck in which all 13 card “values” are equally available, only 4 out of 13 possible draws (about 31%) will keep us at or under the threshold while 9 out of 13 (roughly 69%) would “bust” us by exceeding 44.\n\nMeanwhile, the opponent—whose play history shows they consistently hit (their moves in previous turns in this round have been hits) and who already has a 9 showing—will likely continue aggressively to get close to 44. With our current total of 40, trying to improve might push us into unnecessary risk. In contrast, by standing we secure a total of 40 and force the opponent to try and beat us, likely increasing the chance that they either overshoot or not beat our total.\n\nGiven this high bust probability on a hit, and the fact that our current 40 is a relatively competitive total with only 4 points to go, the conservative and optimal decision here is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the situation – the threshold (N) is 35 and your current total is only 13 – you’re very far from the safe target and must try to build a hand that is as near to 35 as possible without going over. Although we only see the opponent’s face‐up card (a “3”), his fixed strategy in previous rounds shows that he takes a number of hits. With only 13 points, standing now gives you very little chance; you need to take a hit.\n\nTaking into account that you have room to grow before approaching the threshold (35) and that your opponent has a fixed strategy that is not extremely conservative, the statistically best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, you only have a total of 18 while the limit is 35. Since no single card can make you bust (because the maximum card value is 13: 18+13=31, still under 35) and you’re far from reaching the target, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, your current total is 23 and the round’s threshold is 35. With only 12 points “room” left before busting, you must weigh the risk: drawing a card that is 13 (a King) would make you bust—but any card from Ace (1) up to Queen (12) would keep you at or below 35. Since the deck is infinite, every card (from Ace through King) has an equal chance, which means there is only a roughly 1⁄13 chance (about 7.7%) of busting on this hit.\n\nAlso, the opponent’s history shows that when the threshold is below 40 (as in Round 2 with N = 37) they tend to take only a few cards. In the current round, with N = 35, they have already taken two hits (so they now have four cards) and—according to their fixed pattern—they will take one more card and then stop. Their strategy, together with the near‐neutral average of draws from an infinite deck, gives you a chance to bridge your gap from 23 closer to 35.\n\nGiven that you have a low chance of busting (only if you draw a 13) and the fact that standing at 23 would leave you far behind the threshold (and likely behind your opponent’s expected total), the best move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, your total is 27 while the threshold (N) is 35. This means you have an “upside” margin of 8 points before you would exceed 35. With an infinite deck in which every card type (Ace = 1, 2–10, and face cards with values 11, 12, 13) is equally likely (each with a probability of 1\/13), a safe card (one that does not make your total exceed 35) is any card that has a value of 8 or less. That gives you 8 safe outcomes out of 13 (roughly 61.5% chance) and 5 outcomes (about 38.5% chance) that would bust you immediately if drawn.\n\nLooking at the earlier rounds, your opponent’s play has been fixed; even though his own totals end up quite high (even over the threshold), you have seen that his moves are non‐adaptive and he is not “protecting” a low total. In the rounds where your total was increased closer to N (without busting) you won because your opponent ended up over the threshold or at least closer to it. Standing on 27 leaves you quite far from the threshold, and the odds are that—despite a 38.5% bust chance—hitting gives you a considerably better chance at reaching a competitive (or near‐optimal) total of 28 up to 35. This improves your chances because if you get a safe card, you’ll be closer to 35 than if you stand on 27, and your opponent may well overshoot or get a higher total from his fixed hitting strategy.\n\nTherefore, given the risk versus reward in your current situation, the optimal decision is to ask for another card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round, your total is 34 while the threshold is 35. If you hit, the only safe card is an Ace (worth 1) which would bring you exactly to 35; any other card would force you over the threshold. Since the probability of drawing an Ace from an infinite deck (with a standard distribution) is very low, the risk of busting is extremely high by hitting. Standing with a total of 34, even though it is one point below the threshold, is much safer given that the opponent already has a series of hits. Therefore, the best decision is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on our current total of 9 (from cards \"5\" and \"4\") and a threshold of 36, we are very far from the limit. Since every card has a value of at most 13 (with Ace counting as 1), we have no risk of busting on this first move. Also, the opponent’s upcard is a “9” while the second card is unknown, so we cannot assume the opponent is sitting on a very high total. In order to improve our chances of coming as close to 36 as possible without going over, it is optimal for us to request another card.\n\nTherefore, our best move in this situation is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I recommend hitting. With a total of 12 and a high threshold of 36, there’s plenty of room to build your total without risking an immediate bust. Given the opponent’s aggressive (though inconsistent) hitting pattern in earlier rounds and their tendency to overshoot in several rounds, it is advantageous to take another card now to get closer to the threshold. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Your current total is 15 while the threshold is 36. Considering that even the highest value card (13) would bring you to 28, hitting is completely safe at this moment and will help you get closer to the threshold. Given these factors and the fact that your opponent has only one visible card (a 9), your optimal move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation, your current total is 25 and the threshold is 36. With only 11 points to spare before busting, hitting is quite safe because you will bust only if you draw a card valued 12 or 13 (a probability of 2⁄13, roughly 15%). Also, getting closer to 36 is important so that you have a better chance than the opponent, whose own strategy often leaves them with totals near or over the threshold. With an expected card value of 7, you’d likely move up safely from 25, and you’ll have a chance to improve your position before you run too close to 36. Therefore, the optimal move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current game scenario and applying the game rules, your total is only 11 while the threshold is 44. With an infinite deck having all card values equally likely (1, 2, …, 13) and an average of 7 points per card, there's essentially no risk of busting on your next hit. Additionally, you’re starting from a very low total compared to the threshold, so building a stronger hand is necessary to have a chance to outscore your opponent. Given these considerations and knowing that the opponent’s starting face-up card is 9 (with the other card unknown), the optimal strategy here is to request an additional card. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is only 17 while the threshold is 44, and there is no risk of busting by taking one more card (since even the highest card 13 would bring you only to 30). With plenty of “room” available before hitting the limit, it is beneficial to try and get closer to 44 to beat your opponent—especially given that the opponent shows a 9 and we don’t know his hidden cards. Therefore, the best move is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your current total is 28 and the threshold is 44, any card you draw next (with maximum value 13) will not cause you to exceed 44 on this turn. Since your goal is to get as close as possible to 44 in order to beat your opponent – and noting that your opponent’s strategy in past rounds has led them to overshoot or run close to the target – it is in your best interest to improve your hand. Therefore, on Turn 3 you should choose to take another card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current situation we have a total of 33 (7+4+6+J[11]+5) with the threshold at 44. Drawing one more card gives us a chance to come closer to the threshold. In an infinite deck every card (Ace through King) is equally likely. If we hit, we get:\n\n• If the new card is Ace (1) through 10, or a Jack (11), our new total will be between 34 and exactly 44.\n• Only if we get a Queen (12) or King (13) (2 out of 13 possible cards) would we exceed 44, that is about a 15% risk.\n\nWith only a modest risk of busting, the probability that we improve our hand and make it harder for the opponent to beat our total is high. Meanwhile, our opponent’s current cards include one known ‘9’ and four unknown cards (having already hit three times). Their behavior in previous rounds shows that they tend to take at least a few hits and often go over the threshold. By increasing our total now (with a safe hit) we enhance our chances of winning or at least improving our score on the round.\n\nTherefore, given the risk\/reward balance, the best move is to ask for another card—Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the game’s rules, you lose if you are the only one over the threshold. Since your total is already 46 (which is above the threshold of 44), you’re in the bust zone. Requesting another card (hitting) would only increase your total further and cannot bring you back into the safe zone. Given that even if you hit you’re still bust, the only possible “salvage” is if your opponent also busts. However, adding more points doesn’t improve your odds of a draw compared to just standing with your current bust total. Therefore, the best move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the game situation you provided, your total is only 10 while the threshold is 43. This gives you plenty of room before risking going over. Since your opponent’s strategy has been fixed (and from the record it seems they tend to hit several times regardless), you want to try to improve your hand as much as possible without busting. With a starting total of 10, the best decision is to ask for an additional card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the current round’s situation, your total is only 15 (from cards 6, 4, 5) while the threshold is 43. With so much room before you risk busting, and considering that your opponent’s face‐up card is a 10 (suggesting they may be building a high total), you need to improve your total to stay competitive. Based on the rules and previous rounds—where the opponent tends to hit aggressively—it is strategically wiser to draw another card (Hit) rather than stand. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is 27 while the threshold is 43. This means you still have a safe margin (27 + maximum card value 13 = 40, which is still below 43). In addition, your opponent’s visible card is a 10 and their unknown card(s) may potentially make their total higher. Given that you can safely draw another card without the risk of busting, and since you want to get as close to 43 as possible to beat your opponent, the optimal move at this point is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our hand, we currently have 28 points with a lot of room before reaching the threshold of 43. Since our maximum card value is 13, hitting now is completely “safe” in that one hit cannot bust us (28 + 13 = 41, which is still under 43). Also, with the opponent showing a “10” and knowing from the previous rounds that they tend to draw many cards (often overshooting the threshold or picking up high totals that eventually bust), it’s in our best interest to improve our total toward the threshold.\n\nWaiting with 28 hardly gives us any chance of winning unless the opponent busts very early. On the contrary, if we steadily increase our total while staying safely under 43, we can force the opponent to take extra risks and increase the likelihood that they eventually exceed the threshold. In our current strategic situation on turn 4, “Hit” is the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the history and our current total of 33 (with a gap of 10 points until the threshold of 43), the risk of busting on a hit is only about 3 out of 13 (since drawing a card valued 11 or more would exceed 43). In previous rounds the opponent’s strategy often pushed for high totals (or even busts) to get close to or just over the threshold. With a current total of 33, standing would leave us with a relatively weak hand compared to the opponent who already shows a 10. By hitting, we have a good chance to improve our total closer to 43 without too high a risk of busting. Therefore, the best move given the situation is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is exactly 43, which is the threshold for this round. If you hit, no matter which card you get (even an Ace would add 1, bringing the total to 44), you would exceed the threshold and lose immediately. Therefore, your best move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Since your total is exactly equal to the threshold (43) and every additional card has a minimum value of 1—which would push you over 43—it is best to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current round, you only have a total of 10 (with cards \"2\" and \"8\") while the threshold is 40. Because you’re extremely far from the limit and—in light of your previous rounds where careful hitting helped you win—the best action is to request another card. That is, you should hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is only 17 while the threshold is 40. Because even the highest card possible (worth 13 points) would only bring you to 30, it’s very safe to request another card. Moreover, considering the opponent’s fixed strategy (which in previous rounds tends to aggressively hit and often overshoots the threshold), you have little risk of busting on this turn while there’s plenty of room to improve your score toward 40. Therefore, your optimal move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round’s situation, your total is 21 and the threshold is 40. Since no single card (even the highest‐valued King at 13 points) can make your total exceed 40 when added to 21 (21 + 13 = 34), there isn’t any risk of busting on this hit. In addition, with a total of 21 you are considerably far from the threshold, and you need to get as close as possible to 40 to win or at least have a much better chance against the opponent whose face‐up card is only a 2. Therefore, drawing an extra card (Hit) is the optimal move at turn 3 in this round.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round:\n• The threshold is 40 and your total is 31.\n• You need an additional 9 points to reach 40—but if you hit and get a card with value 10 or higher (10, J, Q, or K), you would bust.\n• Given an “infinite deck” with 13 possible card types (values: A=1; numbers 2–10; J=11; Q=12; K=13), the safe cards (A through 9) count 9 out of 13 possibilities (≈69% chance) while 4 out of 13 (≈31% chance) would bust you.\n• With roughly a 70% chance of receiving a safe card (which can help you edge closer to 40) and considering your opponent’s fixed behavior has not produced a dominant winning tendency in previous rounds, it is statistically favorable to take the risk.\n \nThus, the best move in Turn 4 is to request an additional card—Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the rules, your total is already 41, which is more than the current threshold of 40. No matter what card you might get if you hit, your sum will only increase further. Since the settlement rules say that if one side exceeds the threshold (N) and the other doesn't, the side that remains under wins—and if both exceed, the result is a draw—your only hope now is to have the opponent also exceed 40 by the end of the round (resulting in a draw, which gives you 0.5 rather than 0 score). \n\nHowever, acting on your turn cannot reduce your sum or improve your situation. In a game where you’re already over N, there’s no benefit to taking another card (hit) because you'll remain bust. Standing immediately will “lock in” your 41, and then the opponent will play out their strategy. Given our complete knowledge of past rounds and the fact that our only way to get a better outcome is if the opponent also busts, you cannot improve your chance by hitting. \n\nTherefore, the best move now is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given that the threshold for this round is 40 and your current total is 41, you have already exceeded the threshold. According to the rules, if you exceed N, you lose unless your opponent also exceeds N. Since hitting only adds additional positive points and cannot reduce your total, taking another card would only worsen your situation. Therefore, the best (and only sensible) move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the game state at Round 8, your cards already total 41, which exceeds the current threshold of 40. That means you are “bust” (over N). Since winning only occurs if one side is within the limit while the other is not—and if you are already over, the best you can hope for is that your opponent also exceeds the threshold—the only decision that makes sense is to “stand” (i.e. stop taking cards). Hitting would only add more points and would not change the fact that you are over the threshold. Therefore, the optimal move in this situation is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current situation, your total is only 8 points while the threshold is 46. There’s essentially no risk of busting by requesting another card because even the highest‐value card (K, 13 points) would not cause you to exceed 46. Considering that your current total is far from the threshold and that you want to be as close to 46 as possible without going over, the obvious strategy is to ask for another card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current total of 20 (from cards Ace=1, 7, Q=12) and the fact that the threshold is 46, we have plenty of room to improve our score without immediately risking going over. In all previous rounds we saw that the opponent’s fixed strategy makes them keep hitting (often pushing their total above the threshold). Their first visible card in this round is only a 2, so we can expect them to rely on the two unknown cards to build their score—which may lead them to bust or end up drawing. On our side, we want to get as close to 46 as possible without exceeding it, and with a current total of 20 our safe headroom is 26 points. A single additional card (or even several) is required to give us a better chance to win, knowing that we can adjust our risk with our own knowledge (thanks to our complete records).\n\nThus, the best move now is to request another card—that is, to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on my analysis, your current hand totals 31 and the round’s threshold is 46. Since every card’s maximum value is 13, any extra card you draw now (even a “K” worth 13) will bring your total at most to 44, which is still safely below the threshold. In all previous rounds you’ve seen that having a higher total (while staying under the limit) improves your chance of beating the opponent. Moreover, the opponent’s visible card (a 2) is weak, but you don’t know their hidden cards; however, the opponent’s fixed strategy in earlier rounds suggests they tend to hit repeatedly and sometimes “bust,” which gives you an edge if you improve your total from 31. \n\nTherefore, to get closer to 46 and maximize your chance to win the round, you should request another card – that is, you should “Hit.”\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on our current hand and the rules we’re following, our total is 35 while the threshold is 46. That means we have an 11‐point gap. Drawing a card is safe as long as its value is 11 or below (since a card valued at 12 or 13 would push us over 46). In an infinite deck (with 13 equally likely ranks where A = 1, 2–10 as numbered, J = 11, Q = 12, and K = 13), 11 out of 13 cards will keep our total at or under 46 and only 2 out of 13 (the Q and K) would bust us. With roughly an 85% chance to stay safe and improve our total, hitting is the better risk‐reward decision. Also, with our opponent showing only a 2 as a visible card, their starting point seems weak (even though their strategy is fixed, we don’t have certainty about their hidden cards), so getting closer to the threshold is important if they manage to improve.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move at this turn is to request an additional card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Here’s the reasoning:\n\nYour total is already 46, which exactly equals the round’s threshold (N = 46). Taking another card (hitting) would necessarily push your total over 46 since every card is worth at least 1 point. Overstepping the threshold immediately results in a loss unless the opponent also busts. On the other hand, by standing you secure a sum exactly at the threshold. Given that the rules reward being closest to N without going over, it is best not to risk busting. Therefore, the optimal move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the analysis, with the current threshold being a low 31 and your total only 11, standing would almost certainly keep you too far from the target relative to your opponent’s likely total. Since you have plenty of room without the risk of busting early (only 11 so far) and you can improve your total closer to 31, the optimal move is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your current total is 19 and the round’s threshold is 31, you have a wide margin to improve your hand. Since you can add at most 12 without busting (because a card with value 13 would push you over 31), there’s only a roughly 1⁄13 chance on any hit that you would bust. In contrast, drawing a card between 1 and 12 (which happens with probability 12⁄13) will increase your total and bring you closer to 31. Meanwhile, your opponent’s only visible card is a 2 and they have already taken a hit, so their hidden cards may not put them in a very strong position against a well-played total that you can build by drawing wisely.\n\nConsidering both the low risk of busting and the need to get closer to the threshold from a very low value of 19, the optimal strategy here is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the situation you’ve described, with a low threshold of 31 and your current total of 21, you are well below the target even though it means you have some room to improve your total. Examining the previous rounds shows that your opponent’s fixed strategy tends to push them into risky territory (often overshooting the threshold) except on very safe totals. With a 21 against a threshold of 31 it’s highly unlikely your total is competitive if you stand. However, by hitting—with an infinite deck—the probability that you do not bust is the chance of drawing any card of value 10 or lower. Because Aces through 10 (that is, values 1–10) diffuse safely (10 out of 13 possibilities), you have nearly a 77% chance not to exceed 31. Moreover, if you receive a higher card (up to 10), your total can increase closer to the threshold and maximize your winning chances. Even though there’s a roughly 23% risk of bust (if you get an 11, 12, or 13), the potential gain from reaching a sum closer to 31 outweighs that risk in this context.\n\nThus, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round, the threshold is 31 and your total is 24. Reaching closer to 31 gives you a much better chance to beat the opponent without busting. Given that a safe card (one that won’t put you over 31) must be 7 or lower—and about 7 out of 13 ranks (roughly 54% chance) will be safe—it’s worth taking the risk on an additional card to improve your hand. Standing at 24 is rather low, and since the opponent will keep hitting (as seen from previous rounds) to get close to 31, you need to try to improve your total. Therefore, the best decision is to Hit on turn 4.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the facts:\n\n• In the current round the threshold (N) is only 31 and your card total is 26, so you’re 5 points “under” the limit.\n• If you hit, you must draw a card whose value is 1–5 to remain safe. There are 5 “safe” cards out of the 13 possibilities, a roughly 38% chance of staying in play and a 62% chance of busting immediately.\n• The opponent’s fixed strategy (as seen from past rounds) makes them very likely to overshoot a low threshold. Their previous rounds (with thresholds in the 30–40 range) have consistently ended with them over the limit.\n• By standing on 26, you leave the opponent to complete his turn under a very tight threshold, and his history shows that he almost always ends up busting.\n\nThus, the optimal decision is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","I analyzed your current situation. You’re holding a total of 26 while the round’s threshold is 31. To win you want to be as close to 31 as possible without “busting” (going over 31). Right now you’re 5 away from 31 and that margin is too small if you simply stand. (Recall that the opponent appears to be following a fixed automatic “hit‐until–certain‐point” routine; in past rounds with similar thresholds the opponent often ended up busting but – when they didn’t – they ended with totals well above 26.) \n\nIf you choose to hit, you risk drawing a card that pushes your total over 31. Because the card values range from Ace (which is 1) through King (13), only cards with value 1–5 are “safe” for you now (since 26 + 5 = 31). Out of 13 possible cards (an infinite deck with all cards equally likely), that gives you a roughly 5⁄13 (about 38.5%) chance of improving your total safely and reaching somewhere between 27 and 31 (with 5 giving you a perfect 31). However, there’s about a 61.5% chance that the card will be 6 or higher – which would immediately put you over 31 and force you to lose (unless, coincidentally, the opponent also busts).\n\nAlthough this “hit” carries a risk of busting, if you stand on 26 your margin is very low: the opponent (using their fixed strategy) is likely to continue taking cards and reach totals above yours. Past rounds show that even when the opponent busts they often do so by overshooting by several points. In your case, with a very low threshold of 31, even a modest safe hit getting you to 27–30 can be the difference between an automatic loss in a head‐to‐head total comparison and a win if the opponent busts. \n\nGiven the situation – you need to get closer to 31 and your opponent’s past behavior suggests they rarely “play safe” when the threshold is that low – the optimal move is to take the risk and hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
