Currently, my total score is 20, and the threshold N is 33. There is still a relatively large gap between my current score and the threshold, so taking another card (Hit) has a relatively low risk of exceeding the threshold and has the potential to get closer to the threshold N.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\nCurrently, your total card value is 29, which is less than the threshold N = 33. If you choose to hit, there is a risk of exceeding 33. The opponent's face - up card is 4, and we don't know the value of the face - down card. But the opponent has already chosen to stand in the first turn, which might indicate that they think their total is close to or sufficient not to draw another card. Since your current total of 29 is relatively close to 33, if you hit, there is a good chance of going over 33. So, it is wiser to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis: Currently, my total score is 18, and the threshold N is 39. There is still a relatively large gap between my current score and the threshold. Taking another card has a high probability of not exceeding the threshold, and it can increase my score to get closer to 39. So, I should choose to hit.\nAnswer: Hit","First, let's analyze the current situation. The threshold (N) is 39. Your current card total is 30.\n\nIf you stand, your total remains 30. The opponent has a 6 and an unknown card. Since the opponent stood in the first turn, it's likely that the total of their two - card hand is already close to or above a value that they consider safe for the threshold of 39.\n\nIf you hit, there is a chance that you might exceed 39 and lose the round. But if you don't hit, and the opponent's total is higher than 30 but less than 39, you will lose the round.\n\nLet's consider the probability of not exceeding 39 if you hit. The maximum value you can get from a card is 13 (a K). If you get a card with a value of 9 or less, you will not exceed 39. There are 9 number cards (2 - 10) and 1 ace (worth 1 point), so there are 10 non - face cards that will keep you below 39. There are 3 face cards (J, Q, K) that will make you exceed 39.\n\nThe probability of getting a card that keeps you below 39 is \\(\\frac{10}{13}\\approx0.77\\), which is relatively high. So, it's a good idea to take the risk and hit in order to increase your chances of getting closer to 39 and winning the round.\n\nAnswer: Hit","1. Analyze the situation:\n   - The current threshold \\(N = 39\\). Your card total is 35. If you hit, there is a risk of exceeding 39. The lowest - value card you can get is an Ace (worth 1 point), which would make your total 36. But if you get a number card from 4 - 10, a face - card (J, Q, K), you will exceed 39.\n   - The opponent has already stood in the previous two turns. Their visible card is a 6, and we don't know the value of the other card. But since they have stood, it's likely that they either think their total is close to 39 or they are afraid of exceeding it.\n   - Currently, your total of 35 is relatively close to 39. Standing gives you a good chance of winning as long as the opponent's total is less than 35 or they exceed 39.\n2. Conclusion:\n   - It is better for you to stand in this turn to avoid the risk of exceeding 39.\n\nAnswer: Stand","1. **Analysis of the situation**:\n   - Currently, the threshold \\(N = 45\\). My total card value is 11, which is far from the threshold. The opponent has a 4 and an unknown card. The opponent's fixed - strategy in the previous two rounds was to stand in the first turn.\n   - Since my current total is much lower than the threshold, taking an additional card (Hit) has a high probability of getting closer to the threshold without exceeding it. For example, even if I get a face - card (the maximum value non - exceeding card in terms of a bad - case scenario here), my total will still be within the limit. If I get a number card, it will also help me get closer to the threshold.\n2. **Decision**:\n   - I should choose to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the history, the opponent seems to have a strategy of standing early. Currently, our total is 23 and the threshold is 45. We are quite far from the threshold, so it is beneficial to request an additional card to get closer to the threshold without exceeding it.\nAnswer: Hit","1. **Analysis of the situation**:\n   - The current threshold \\(N = 45\\). Our current total is 36, and the opponent has shown a 4 with an unknown card and has already chosen to stand in the first two turns.\n   - The opponent's strategy seems to be to stand early. Based on the previous rounds, it's likely that the opponent's total is not very high.\n   - If we hit, there is a risk of going over 45. But we are still relatively far from 45, and by hitting, we have a chance to get closer to 45 and increase our chances of winning.\n   - For example, if we get a low - value card like a 2 - 9, our total will get closer to 45 without exceeding it. The probability of getting a card that will make us go over 45 is not extremely high at this point.\n2. **Decision**:\n   - We should choose to hit to try to get closer to 45 and improve our winning chances.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the history, the opponent seems to have a strategy of standing early. Our current total is 18 and the threshold is 32. There is a good chance that we can get closer to 32 by hitting without exceeding it. So, I suggest hitting.\nAnswer: Hit","1. **Analysis of the current situation**:\n   - The current threshold \\(N = 32\\). Your total card value is 30. If you hit, there is a risk of exceeding 32. Since number cards (2 - 10) have values from 2 to 10, face - cards (J, Q, K) have values 11, 12, 13 respectively, and aces have a value of 1. If you draw any non - ace card, you will exceed 32.\n   - The opponent's visible card is a 'Q' (value 12). Their total is unknown because of the face - down card, but they have already chosen to stand in the first turn. It is likely that they think their total is close enough to 32 and don't want to risk exceeding it.\n   - Since your total of 30 is already quite close to 32, and hitting has a high probability of causing you to exceed 32, it is better to stand.\n2. **Output in the required format**:\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis:\n1. First, understand the opponent's strategy from the history. In all previous rounds, the opponent always stands in the first turn and then stands again without taking any more cards. So, we can assume the opponent will stand again in this round.\n2. Calculate the current total of our cards, which is 13. The threshold \\(N = 29\\). We still have a large gap to reach the threshold.\n3. Drawing an additional card has a relatively high chance of not exceeding 29. For example, even if we draw a face - card (the maximum value among non - drawn cards), \\(13+13 = 26<29\\).\n\nBased on the above analysis, it is beneficial for us to request an additional card (Hit) in this turn.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. Currently, our total score is 20 and the threshold \\(N = 29\\). There is a room of \\(29 - 20=9\\) points to hit without exceeding the threshold.\n2. Looking at the opponent's strategy from the history, in the previous 4 rounds, the opponent always stands in the first turn. Their first - card in the current round is 6. Since they stand early, it is likely that their total score is relatively low.\n3. If we stand now, with a score of 20, we are not very close to the threshold of 29. By hitting, there is a good chance to get closer to 29 without exceeding it. For example, getting a card from 2 - 9 will make our score closer to 29 and increase our winning probability.\n\nSo, the best move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n- Currently, your total score is 22 and the threshold N is 29. There is a difference of 7 between your current total and N.\n- The opponent has a face - up 6 and an unknown card. Since the opponent has chosen to stand in the first two turns, it is likely that the opponent's total is relatively close to N or they think it is a good enough score.\n- If you choose to hit, there is a risk of exceeding 29. But considering that your current score is 22, and there is a relatively large gap from 29, and the opponent has stood early, it is possible that hitting one more card may increase your chances of getting closer to 29 without exceeding it.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Looking at the history, the opponent's fixed strategy seems to be standing in the first turn. Our current total is 14 and the threshold N is 30. We have a lot of room to increase our score without exceeding N. Taking an additional card (Hit) gives us a good chance to get closer to 30 and potentially win the round.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n- Currently, our total score is 24 and the threshold N is 30. The opponent has stood in the first turn, and their known card is 3. We can see from the history that the opponent has a strategy of standing early.\n- If we stand now, our score is 24. There is a chance that the opponent's total score is less than 24, or the opponent exceeds 30. But if we hit, there is a risk of exceeding 30, yet we also have a chance to get closer to 30 to increase our winning probability.\n- Since the difference between our current score and 30 is 6, and considering the opponent's early - standing strategy, it is reasonable to take a risk and hit to get closer to 30.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Looking at the history, the opponent seems to have a strategy of standing early.

The difference between our current score and the threshold is 41 - 24 = 17.\n- Looking at the opponent's situation, they showed a 7 and we don't know their other card. But based on the history, the opponent has a fixed strategy of standing early.\n- If we take another card (Hit), there is a chance to get closer to 41 without exceeding it. The risk of exceeding 41 is relatively low considering our current score.\n- So, it is a good choice to Hit to increase our score and try to get closer to the threshold.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Let's analyze the situation. The current total of my cards is 36 and the threshold N is 41. The difference between my current total and N is 41 - 36 = 5.\n\nThe opponent has a 7 and an unknown card. Since the opponent has been standing in the previous turns, it's likely that the opponent's total is already close to or above their desired value.\n\nIf I hit, there's a risk of going over 41. For example, if I draw a face - card (worth at least 11), I will definitely go over 41. \n\nIf I stand, with a total of 36, as long as the opponent's total is either over 41 or less than 36, I win. \n\nBased on this analysis, it's a better move to stand.\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis:\n1.

We are still far from the threshold, and there is a high chance that drawing another card will not cause us to exceed 24.

We still have a lot of room to draw cards to get closer to 29. Since our total score is relatively low, it is beneficial for us to draw another card to increase our score and have a better chance of winning. So we should choose to hit.\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. In the previous round, the opponent stood early and got a relatively low - scoring hand. It seems that the opponent has a conservative strategy of standing early.\n2. Our current total is 18, and the threshold N is 29. There is still a relatively large gap between our current total and the threshold.\n3. Drawing another card has a relatively high probability of not exceeding 29. If we draw a card from 2 - 11, we will not exceed 29. The probability of getting a card that will not make us exceed 29 is quite high.\n\nSo, the better move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","First, let's analyze the situation. Currently, our total score is 20, and the threshold N is 29. There is a certain gap between our current score and the threshold, and we have a chance to get closer to N without exceeding it.\n\nLooking at the opponent's situation, their face - up card is 2, and we don't know the other card. But they have already chosen to stand in the previous three turns, which might indicate that they think their score is close to N or they are worried about exceeding N.\n\nIf we choose to stand at this time, our score is 20. We are not sure if the opponent's score is closer to 29 than ours. However, if we choose to hit, we have a possibility of increasing our score and getting closer to 29 without exceeding it.\n\nThe probability of getting a card that won't make us exceed 29 is relatively high. For example, getting an Ace (1 point), 2 - 9 cards won't make us exceed 29 immediately.\n\nSo, it is a better choice to hit in this situation.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Since your current total is 27 and the threshold (N) is 29, taking another card (Hit) has a high risk of exceeding 29. Standing will keep your total at 27. The opponent's visible card is 2, and even if the unknown card is a K (worth 13), their maximum possible total is 15. It seems safe to stand as there is a good chance your total of 27 will be closer to 29 than the opponent's total.\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the history, the opponent seems to have a tendency to stand early. Our current total is 15 and the threshold is 28. There is a good chance that taking another card will bring us closer to 28 without exceeding it. So, the better move is to Hit.\nAnswer: Hit","Since my total is already 28 which is equal to the threshold (N = 28), if I take another card (Hit), I will definitely exceed 28 and lose if the opponent does not exceed 28. So, I should stop taking cards and choose to Stand.\nAnswer: Stand","Looking at the opponent's strategy from the previous rounds, the opponent always stands in the first turn. Also, our current total of 18 is quite far from the threshold of 41. So, it is a good idea to take an additional card to get closer to the threshold. \nAnswer: Hit","1. **Analysis based on the opponent's strategy and the current situation**:\n   - From the previous rounds, we can observe that the opponent has a tendency to stand early. In all the previous rounds, the opponent stood in the first turn.\n   - Our current total is 24, and the threshold \\(N = 41\\). There is a relatively large gap between our current total and the threshold.\n   - Since we have some room to increase our total without exceeding the threshold easily, and considering the opponent's conservative strategy of standing early, it is beneficial for us to take a risk and try to get closer to the threshold. So, we should choose to hit.\n2. **Output in the required format**:\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis: Currently, your card total is 37 and the threshold (N) is 41. There is a difference of 4 points from the threshold. The opponent has a 7 and an unknown card, and the opponent has chosen to stand in the previous two turns. It's very likely that the opponent is afraid of exceeding the threshold. If you choose to hit, there is a high risk of exceeding 41. Since your current total is already close to 41, standing is a safer option.\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis:\n1. First, understand the opponent's strategy from the history. In all previous rounds, the opponent chose to stand in the first turn. So, it is very likely that the opponent will stand again in this round.\n2. Calculate the current total of my cards. I currently have an 'A' (worth 1 point) and a '10' (worth 10 points), with a total of 11 points. The threshold N is 30.\n3. Determine the best move. Since my current total is far from the threshold of 30 and it seems the opponent will stand early, I should take another card (Hit) to get closer to the threshold and increase my chance of winning.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Looking at the opponent's strategy in previous rounds, they tend to stand early. In the current round, their known card is a 'Q' (worth 12 points), and we don't know the value of the face - down card. Our total is 24 with a threshold of 30. There is still some room to get closer to 30 without exceeding it. So, it is a good idea to request an additional card (Hit).\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n- Currently, your card total is 28 and the threshold N is 30.\n- The opponent's known card is a 'Q' (worth 12 points), and we don't know the value of the other card. But the opponent has already stood in the previous two turns.\n- If you choose to hit, there is a high risk of exceeding 30 because you are already very close to the threshold. And since the opponent has stood, it is likely that they think their total is close to or good enough relative to the threshold.\n- If you stand with a total of 28, there is a chance that the opponent's total is less than 28, or exceeds 30, in which cases you win. There is also a small chance of a draw if the opponent also has 28.\n\nDecision: Stand\nAnswer: Stand","Looking at the opponent's fixed strategy from the previous rounds, the opponent always stands in the first turn. \nMy current total is 14 and the threshold N is 31. There is a significant gap between my current total and the threshold, so it is beneficial for me to request an additional card to get closer to the threshold.\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, understand the opponent's strategy based on the history:\n   - In all previous rounds, the opponent has chosen to stand in the first turn and then kept standing. So, it seems the opponent's fixed strategy is to stand after the first - turn without drawing any more cards.\n2. Analyze the current situation:\n   - Our current total is 21, and the threshold \\(N = 31\\). There is a gap of \\(31 - 21=10\\).\n   - Since the opponent seems to stand early, we have an opportunity to get closer to the threshold. If we draw a card, as long as the card value is not greater than 10, we will not exceed the threshold.\n   - The probability of getting a card with a value of 1 - 10 from an infinite deck is relatively high. So, it is beneficial for us to draw another card to increase our total and get closer to the threshold.\n\nAnswer: Hit\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis: My current total score is 29, which is very close to the threshold N = 31. If I choose to hit, there is a high probability that I will exceed 31 and lose. Since the opponent stood in the previous two turns, it is likely that their score is not very high. So, I should choose to stand to maintain my current advantage.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the opponent's strategy in previous rounds, they always stand in the first turn. Our current total is 19, and the threshold (N) is 29. We still have a relatively large gap to reach the threshold, so it is beneficial for us to request an additional card to get closer to 29.\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n- First, summarize the opponent's strategy from the history. In all previous rounds, the opponent always stands in the first turn and then doesn't take any more actions.\n- The current threshold \\(N = 29\\), and our current total score is 24. If we hit, there is a risk of exceeding 29. But considering that the opponent seems to always stand early and their known card is an 'A' (worth 1 point), even if their unknown card is a 'K' (worth 13 points), their maximum possible total is \\(1 + 13=14\\). Our current score of 24 is already quite close to 29 and much higher than the opponent's possible maximum score. So, it is better for us to stand to avoid the risk of exceeding 29.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the history, the opponent has a strategy of standing early. Our current total is 9, and the threshold N is 26. We are far from the threshold, so it is beneficial to take another card to get closer to N.\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, we know the opponent's fixed strategy is to stand early based on the history records. So far, in all previous rounds, the opponent always stands in the first turn.\n2. Our current total is 21 and the threshold \\(N = 26\\). If we hit, there is a chance to get closer to 26 and increase our winning probability. But there is also a risk of exceeding 26.\n3. The possible cards we can get from an infinite - deck:\n   - If we get an Ace (value 1), our total will be \\(21 + 1=22\\).\n   - If we get a 2 - 5, our total will be between 23 - 26.\n   - If we get a 6, our total will be \\(21+6 = 27\\) which exceeds 26.\n   - For face - cards (J, Q, K) with values 11, 12, 13, we will also exceed 26.\n4. Considering the opponent's low known card value (4) and the fact that we are relatively far from the threshold, the probability of getting a card that will not exceed 26 is relatively high. So, it is beneficial for us to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","1. Analyze the situation:\n   - Currently, our total card value is 13, and the threshold \\(N = 34\\). We are far from the threshold.\n   - Looking at the opponent's strategy from the history, in all previous rounds, the opponent stands in the first turn. So, it is very likely that the opponent will stand again this time.\n   - Since we have a lot of room to increase our score without exceeding the threshold, taking an additional card (Hit) is a good option to get closer to the threshold.\n2. Output in the required format:\n   - Based on the above analysis, the move we should make is \"Hit\".\n   - Answer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, understand the opponent's strategy from the history. In all previous rounds, the opponent always stands in the first turn and then stands throughout the rest of the round. So, we can assume the opponent will stand this round too.\n2. Our current total is 21, and the threshold \\(N = 34\\). There is still a relatively large gap between our current total and the threshold. If we take another card, there is a good chance that we can get closer to 34 without exceeding it. For example, if we get a number card from 2 - 10, we will be closer to 34. Even if we get a face - card, there is still a possibility that we won't exceed 34.\n3. By hitting, we have an opportunity to increase our score and get closer to 34, which will give us a better chance of winning the round.\n\nAnswer: Hit\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, we look at the opponent's strategy based on the history. In all previous rounds, the opponent always stands in the first turn and does not take any more cards.\n2.

There is a relatively large gap between our current total and the threshold. If we take another card, there is a high probability that we can get closer to the threshold without exceeding it, as we need a card with a value of 12 or more to exceed the threshold.\n4. By taking another card (hitting), we have a good chance to increase our score and get closer to the threshold, thus increasing our chance of winning the round.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the history, the opponent has a fixed strategy of standing after the first turn. Currently, our total is 10 and the threshold is 35. We are far from the threshold, so it is beneficial for us to take another card to get closer to 35. \nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, look at the opponent's situation: The opponent has a 'J' (worth 11 points), and we don't know the value of the other card. But from the history, we can see that the opponent's strategy is to stand early.\n2. Consider our own situation: Our current total is 13 points, and the threshold \\(N = 35\\). We are far from the threshold, so it is very likely that we can draw another card without exceeding the threshold. By hitting, we have a chance to get closer to the threshold and increase our winning probability.\n3. Conclusion: We should choose to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\nThe opponent's known card is a 'J' which is worth 11 points. The maximum value of the unknown card is 13 (a 'K'). So the maximum total points the opponent can have is \\(11 + 13=24\\). Our current total is 18, and the threshold \\(N = 35\\). We still have a lot of room to increase our score without exceeding the threshold. So it is beneficial for us to request an additional card (Hit) to get closer to 35.\n\nAnswer: Hit","First, let's analyze the situation. The current total of our cards is 30, and the threshold N is 35. The opponent has a 'J' (worth 11 points) and an unknown card.\n\nThe opponent's known - card value is 11. The maximum value of the unknown card is 13 (a 'K'). So the maximum total of the opponent's cards could be 11 + 13 = 24.\n\nIf we hit, there is a risk of exceeding 35.

There is still a relatively large gap between my current total and the threshold. If I take another card (Hit), there is a good chance that I can get closer to 42 without exceeding it.\nSince the opponent has already stood with a known card of 3 and an unknown card, I don't know their total, but aiming to get closer to 42 is a reasonable strategy at this point.\n\nAnswer: Hit","First, let's analyze the situation. Our current total is 35, and the threshold N is 42. The difference between our total and the threshold is 42 - 35 = 7.\n\nThe opponent has a 3 and an unknown card. The maximum value of the opponent's hand without going over 42 is 42 - 3= 39 (assuming the unknown card is a K).\n\nIf we take a hit, there is a risk of going over 42. But we are relatively far from the threshold, and taking a hit gives us a chance to get closer to 42 and potentially win. The probability of getting a card that will make us go over 42 immediately is relatively low. For example, if we get an Ace (1 point), 2 - 7 cards, we will still be under 42.\n\nSo, it is a good idea to take a hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. Currently, your total card value is 7, which is far from the threshold \\(N = 37\\).\n2. Drawing an additional card (hitting) has a very low risk of exceeding the threshold at this stage.\n3. By hitting, you have a chance to get closer to the threshold and increase your chance of winning the round.\n\nSo, the best move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\nIn the current round, the threshold \\(N = 37\\). Our current total is 17. The opponent has a 'J' (worth 11 points) and an unknown card, and they have already chosen to stand.\nIf we hit, there is a good chance to get closer to 37 without exceeding it. Since our current total is quite far from 37, taking another card can increase our chances of getting a better total and potentially winning the round. If we stand now, our total of 17 is likely to be much lower than the opponent's total (even considering the unknown card, it's very likely the opponent's total is higher than 17 as they have a 'J').\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n- Currently, your total score is 18 and the threshold N is 37. There is still a relatively large gap between your current score and the threshold.\n- The opponent has a face - up 'J' (worth 11 points) and an unknown card. They have already chosen to stand in the previous two turns, which might indicate that they are relatively close to the threshold or afraid of exceeding it.\n- Since you are far from the threshold, taking another card (Hit) has a high probability of getting closer to 37 without exceeding it. If you stand now, your score of 18 is likely to be lower than the opponent's total in most cases.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Let's analyze the situation. Currently, your total score is 31 and the threshold N is 37. There is a difference of 37 - 31 = 6 points between your current total and the threshold.\n\nThe opponent's face - up card is a 'J' which is worth 11 points. We don't know the value of the face - down card, but the maximum value of the face - down card can be 13 (a 'K'). So the maximum possible total of the opponent is 11 + 13 = 24.\n\nIf you hit, there is a risk of exceeding 37. For example, if you draw a card with a value of 7 or more, you will lose.\n\nSince your current score of 31 is already higher than the maximum possible score of the opponent at this moment (24), it is a good idea to stand and secure the win.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the history, the opponent seems to have a tendency to stand early.

First, let's understand the opponent's strategy based on the history. In both previous rounds, the opponent chose to stand in the first turn and did not take any more cards later. So, it seems the opponent has a conservative strategy of standing early.\n2. Currently, our total score is 22 and the threshold \\(N = 43\\). We still have a large gap from the threshold, and considering the opponent's conservative strategy, there is a high chance that their score is not very high.\n3. Drawing another card has a relatively low risk of exceeding 43 at this moment. For example, even if we draw a face - card (the maximum value is 13), our total will be \\(22 + 13=35\\) which is still below 43. So, it is beneficial for us to take a hit to get closer to the threshold.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n- The current total of my cards is 33, and the threshold N is 43. So there is still a gap of 43 - 33 = 10 points before reaching the threshold.\n- Looking at the opponent's strategy from the previous rounds, in both previous rounds, the opponent chose to stand very early. In round 1, the opponent stood right after the first turn, and in round 2, the opponent also stood early. In the current round, the opponent has already stood in the first two turns. The opponent's face - up card is a 'Q' (worth 12 points). Even if the unknown card is a 'K' (worth 13 points), the opponent's maximum total would be 12 + 13 = 25 points.\n- Since I am still far from the threshold and the opponent seems to be conservative with a likely relatively low total, it is beneficial for me to take another card to get closer to the threshold. So I should choose to 'Hit'.\n\nAnswer: Hit","1. Analyze the situation:\n   - The current total of my cards is 37, and the threshold \\(N = 43\\). The difference between my current total and the threshold is \\(43 - 37=6\\).\n   - The opponent has a 'Q' (worth 12 points) and an unknown - card.

But if I stand, my total is 37. Since the maximum possible total of the opponent's cards is 25, I am already closer to the threshold of 43 than the maximum possible total of the opponent's cards. So, it is safe to stand.\n2. Output in the required format:\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis:\n- Currently, my total card value is 13, and the threshold N is 44. There is a large gap between my current total and the threshold.\n- Based on the opponent's fixed - strategy in previous rounds, the opponent usually stands early.\n- Taking an additional card (Hit) has a high probability of not exceeding the threshold and can increase my total to get closer to N, thus increasing the chance of winning.\n\nAnswer: Hit","1. **Analysis**:\n   - First, let's analyze the opponent's strategy based on the history. In all previous rounds, the opponent stood in the first turn. So, it seems the opponent has a strategy of standing early without taking additional cards.\n   - Our current total is 16, and the threshold \\(N = 44\\). There is a significant gap between our current total and the threshold. We have a relatively low - risk situation to take another card. If we hit, there is a high chance that we can get closer to the threshold without exceeding it.\n   - For example, if we get a number card from 2 - 10, it will increase our total in a reasonable range. Even if we get a face - card, our total will still be within a manageable range in most cases.\n2. **Decision**:\n   - Based on the above analysis, it is a good idea to take an additional card, so the move should be \"Hit\".\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n- In the previous rounds, the opponent's strategy seems to be to stand early. In this round, the opponent has already stood twice.\n- Our current total is 22, and the threshold N is 44. There is still a large gap between our current total and the threshold. So, taking another card (Hit) has a relatively high chance of getting closer to 44 without exceeding it.\n\nAnswer: Hit","First, let's analyze the situation. Our current total is 31 and the threshold N is 44. The opponent has stood in the previous three turns, and we know one of their cards is 7. Since they have stood early, it's likely their total is already quite close to 44 without going over.\n\nIf we hit, there is a risk of going over 44. But currently, we are 13 points away from the threshold. We still have a good margin to take one more card and try to get closer to 44.\n\nLet's assume a simple probability - the average value of a card in the deck.\nThe sum of values of all possible cards: \\(1\\times4 + 2\\times4+3\\times4 + 4\\times4+5\\times4+6\\times4+7\\times4+8\\times4+9\\times4+10\\times4+11\\times4+12\\times4+13\\times4\\)\n\\(=4\\times(1 + 2+3+\\cdots+13)=4\\times\\frac{13\\times(13 + 1)}{2}=4\\times91 = 364\\)\nThe average value of a card in an infinite - deck is \\(\\frac{364}{52}=7\\)\n\nIf we take another card, on average, our new total will be \\(31+7 = 38\\), which is still under 44.\n\nSo, it's a good idea to hit to get closer to 44.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Let's analyze whether to hit or stand.\nCurrently, our total score is 34, and the threshold \\(N = 44\\). There is a difference of \\(44 - 34=10\\) between our current score and the threshold.\n\nLooking at the opponent's strategy from the previous rounds, in all previous rounds, the opponent has chosen to stand in every turn. So far, the opponent has a '7' and an unknown - card. The maximum score the opponent can get is \\(7 + 13=20\\) (assuming the unknown card is a 'K').\n\nIf we hit, as long as the card we get is not greater than \\(44 - 34 = 10\\), we will not exceed the threshold and are likely to get closer to 44. Since the probability of getting a card with a value of 1 - 10 from an infinite deck is relatively high, hitting gives us a good chance to increase our score and get closer to 44 without exceeding it.\n\nSo, the better move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Since my total score is already exactly equal to the threshold (N = 44), if I take another card (Hit), I will definitely exceed the threshold and lose if the opponent does not exceed it. So, I should stop drawing cards.\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis:\n1. First, understand the opponent's strategy based on the history. In all previous rounds, the opponent always stands in the first turn. So, we can expect the opponent to stand in this turn as well.\n2. Consider our own situation. Our current total is 26, and the threshold \\(N = 37\\). There is a difference of \\(37 - 26=11\\) between our current total and the threshold.\n3. The probability of getting a card that does not make us exceed 37 is relatively high. For example, if we get an Ace (1 point), a 2 - 10 (2 - 10 points), we will not exceed 37. Even if we get a Jack (11 points), we will exactly reach 37.\n4. By taking a hit, we have a good chance to get closer to the threshold of 37 and increase our chances of winning.\n\nSo, the best move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Since my current total is already 37 which is equal to the threshold (N). If I hit, there is a high probability that I will exceed 37 and lose the game. So, I should stand.\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the opponent's strategy in previous rounds (always standing early), and considering that our current total of 12 is quite far from the threshold of 27, it is beneficial for us to request an additional card to get closer to 27. So, the move should be 'Hit'.\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\nThe current threshold \\(N = 27\\), my current total is 24. The opponent's known card is 2 and the other is unknown.\nThe opponent has a fixed strategy and has chosen to stand in the first turn. From the history, we can see that the opponent seems to have a tendency to stand early.\nIf I choose to hit, there is a risk of exceeding 27. For example, if I get a card with a value of 4 or more, I will exceed 27. Since my current total of 24 is relatively close to 27 and the opponent has already stood, it is a safer option to stand to avoid going over the limit.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis:\n- Currently, my total score is 22, and the threshold N is 28. There is a gap of 6 points between my current total and the threshold.\n- Looking at the opponent's known card, they have a 'Q' (worth 12 points).

For example, getting a card with a value of 1 - 6 is beneficial. \n\nAnswer: Hit\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, understand the rules and the current situation:\n   - The goal is to get a total card - value as close to the threshold \\(N = 28\\) as possible without exceeding it.\n   - Your current total is 26 with cards ['10', 'Q', '4'].\n   - The opponent has a 'Q' (worth 12 points) and an unknown card. The opponent stood in the first turn.\n2. Consider the probability of going over the threshold if you hit:\n   - The minimum value of a card from the infinite deck is 1 (Ace) and the maximum is 13 (King).\n   - If you hit and get an Ace (1 point), your new total will be \\(26 + 1=27\\), which is still below the threshold.\n   - If you hit and get a 2, your new total will be \\(26 + 2 = 28\\), which is exactly the threshold.\n   - However, if you hit and get a card with a value of 3 or more, you will go over the threshold (e.g., with a 3, \\(26+3 = 29\\gt28\\)).\n3. Analyze the opponent's situation based on the history:\n   - The opponent has a fixed strategy and has always stood in the previous rounds after the first turn. The opponent has a 'Q' (12 points). The maximum value of the unknown card is 13, and the minimum is 1. So the opponent's total can range from \\(12 + 1=13\\) to \\(12+13 = 25\\).\n   - Since your current total of 26 is already close to the threshold and the risk of going over the threshold by hitting is relatively high, it is more prudent to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Looking at the history, the opponent has a consistent strategy of standing early.

Currently, the total of my cards is 21, and the threshold \\(N = 32\\). There is still a lot of room to draw a card without exceeding the threshold.\n2. The opponent has a 7 - point card and an unknown card. Since the opponent stood in the first turn, it is likely that the opponent's total is close to or has reached a value where they think it is safe not to draw.\n3. To increase my chance of getting closer to 32, I should draw another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\nMy current card total is 31, and the threshold N is 32. If I choose to hit, there is a high risk of exceeding 32 and losing the game. Since my opponent has only stood in the previous two turns and their known card is a 7, even if their unknown card is a K (the highest - value non - exceeding card in a way that matters here), their maximum total would be \\(7 + 13=20\\). So, it is safer for me to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Looking at the history, the opponent has a strategy of standing early in most rounds. Our current total is 14 and the threshold is 33, which means we are quite far from the threshold. There is a high chance that we can get closer to 33 without exceeding it by taking another card.

From the history, we can observe that the opponent's strategy is mostly to stand in the early turns.\n   - If we take a hit, there is a chance that we can get closer to 33 and increase our winning probability. However, there is also a risk of exceeding 33. The probability of getting a card that will not make us exceed 33 is relatively high. The cards that will not make us exceed 33 are 1 (Ace), 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Since we are drawing from an infinite deck, there are 6 non - busting cards out of 13 possible card values.\n   - Given that the opponent seems to have a low - risk strategy (standing early), we can try to get closer to the threshold. So, it is a good idea to take a hit.\n2. **Required format**:\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n- Currently, your card total is 32, which is very close to the threshold N = 33.\n- The opponent has a '2' and an unknown card. Since the opponent has been standing in the previous turns, it seems likely that their total is not far from a value where they think it's safe not to draw more.\n- If you hit, there is a high risk of exceeding 33. For example, even the lowest - value card (an Ace worth 1 point) will make your total 33, and any other card will make you go over 33.\n- Given your current total is already very close to 33 and the risk of going over by hitting, it is more advisable to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis: Currently, our total score is 11, and the threshold N is 28. We are quite far from the threshold. Based on the opponent's strategy in previous rounds, they usually choose to stand in the first turn.

There is still room to draw a card without exceeding the limit.\n2. The opponent's known card is 3, and they have already chosen to stand.

If I take a hit, there is a risk of exceeding 27. The opponent's face - up card is 3, and their total is unknown.

So, it is wiser to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis: Currently, my total score is 10 and the threshold N is 46. There is a large gap between my current score and the threshold, so taking another card (Hit) is very likely to get closer to the threshold without exceeding it. Also, looking at the history, when I actively took cards in the previous round, I was able to get a score close to the threshold and win. So in this round, I should also choose to Hit.\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\nWe currently have a total of 17 points with a threshold N = 46. There is still a large gap between our current total and the threshold. Requesting an additional card (Hit) has a relatively low risk of exceeding the threshold, and it can potentially increase our total to get closer to the threshold and gain an advantage in the settlement.\n\nAnswer: Hit\nAnswer: Hit","1. Analyze the situation:\n   - Currently, your total score is 19, and the threshold \\(N = 46\\). There is still a large gap between your current score and the threshold.\n   - The opponent has a \\(Q\\) (worth 12 points) and an unknown - card. In the previous two turns, the opponent has chosen to stand. This might indicate that the opponent either has a relatively high - scoring hand close to \\(N\\) already or is being overly cautious.\n   - Since there is a lot of room to increase your score without exceeding \\(N\\), it is beneficial to take another card to get closer to \\(N\\).\n2. Conclusion:\n   - The best move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, calculate the range of the opponent's total score. The face - up card of the opponent is a 'Q' which is worth 12 points. The value of the face - down card can range from 1 (Ace) to 13 (K). So the minimum total score of the opponent is \\(12 + 1=13\\) and the maximum is \\(12+13 = 25\\).\n2. Our current total score is 28, and the threshold \\(N = 46\\).\n3. If we hit, there is a chance to get closer to 46 and increase our winning probability. The risk of exceeding 46 is relatively small because we are currently at 28. The average value of a card in the infinite deck is \\(\\frac{1 + 2+\\cdots+13}{13}=\\frac{(1 + 13)\\times13\/2}{13}=7\\). If we get a card with an average value of 7, our new total will be \\(28 + 7=35\\), which is still far from 46.\n4. If we stand, our score remains 28. There is a possibility that the opponent may get a high - value card and get closer to 46 than us.\n\nBased on the above analysis, it is more beneficial for us to hit in this situation.\n\nAnswer: Hit","1. **Analysis of the situation**:\n   - The current total of your cards is 37, and the threshold \\(N = 46\\). So you still have \\(46 - 37=9\\) points of room before exceeding the threshold.\n   - The opponent's known card is a 'Q' (worth 12 points). Since the opponent has already stood in the previous 4 turns, it is likely that the opponent's total is close to the threshold or they think they have a good - enough hand.\n   - The probability of getting a card that will not make your total exceed 46 is relatively high. For example, if you get a card with a value of 1 - 9, you will still be within the threshold.\n   - By taking another card, you have a chance to get closer to 46 and increase your chances of winning.\n2. **Decision**:\n   - Based on the above analysis, it is a good idea to 'Hit' in this turn.\n\nAnswer: Hit","First, let's analyze the situation. Our current total is 39 with a threshold of 46. There is a difference of 46 - 39 = 7 points between our current total and the threshold.\n\nThe opponent has a face - up 'Q' which is worth 12 points. The opponent's total is unknown as there is a face - down card.\n\nLooking at the history, in the first round, the opponent's strategy was to stand early. It is likely that the opponent will not take more cards this time either.\n\nIf we take another card, there is a risk of exceeding 46. Since we are already close to the threshold, it is better to play it safe and not take the risk of going over.\n\nSo, the best move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the history, the opponent seems to have a strategy of standing early. Currently, my total is 11 and the threshold is 37, which is a relatively large gap. It is beneficial for me to try to get closer to the threshold by taking an additional card. So I should choose to Hit.\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the history, the opponent seems to have a tendency to stand early. Our current total is 13, and the threshold N is 37. There is a relatively large gap between our current total and the threshold, so it is beneficial for us to try to get closer to N by taking another card.\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n- Currently, our total card value is 20 and the threshold N is 37. There is still a significant gap of 17 points between our current total and the threshold.\n- From the history, we can see that the opponent seems to have a strategy of standing early.\n- Drawing another card has a relatively high probability of not exceeding the threshold. If we get a card value less than or equal to 17, we will be closer to the threshold and have a better chance of winning.\n\nDecision: We should Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Currently, your total card value is 31 and the threshold N is 37. There is a difference of 6 between your current total and the threshold. The opponent has stood in the previous turns and only has a '2' revealed so far.\n\nIf you choose to hit, there is a risk of exceeding 37. Since your current total is already quite close to 37 and the opponent has shown a relatively low - value card and has been standing, it is more prudent to stand. This way, you can avoid the risk of going over the threshold and increase your chances of winning based on the current advantage.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current situation, my total score is 23 which is already very close to the threshold of 24. If I choose to hit, there is a high risk of exceeding 24 and losing the game. Since my opponent's total score is unknown but their face - up card is 6, even if their face - down card is an Ace (the lowest - value card), their maximum possible total score is much lower than my current total score if I stand. So, I should stand.\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the history, the opponent seems to have a tendency to stand early. Currently, our total is 14 and the threshold is 32, so there is a relatively large gap. We can safely take another card to get closer to the threshold.\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, look at the opponent's behavior pattern from the history. In all previous rounds, the opponent always stands in the first turn. So, it's very likely that the opponent will stand again this round.\n2. Calculate the distance to the threshold (N = 32) for your current hand. Your current total is 24, and the distance to 32 is \\(32 - 24=8\\).\n3. Consider the risk - reward of taking a hit. The probability of getting a card that won't make you exceed 32 is relatively high. If we assume an infinite deck, there are many cards (2 - 8) that can be safely added to your hand.\n4. By taking a hit, we have a good chance of getting closer to 32 without exceeding it, which will increase our chances of winning.\n\nDecision: Hit\nAnswer: Hit","Looking at the history, the opponent seems to have a strategy of standing early. Our current total is 29, and the threshold is 32. There is a small gap of 3 points. If we hit, there is a significant risk of exceeding 32 as most cards in the deck will push our total over the limit. Since we are already close to the threshold and in a good position compared to the opponent's known card total of 10, it is wiser to stand.\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis:\n1. First, we look at the history of the opponent's strategy. In the previous 5 rounds, the opponent always chose to stand in the first turn. So, we can assume that the opponent is likely to stand again in this round.\n2. Our current total score is 20, and the threshold \\(N = 31\\). The difference between our current total and the threshold is \\(31 - 20=11\\).\n3. Since the opponent is likely to stand early, we have an opportunity to get closer to the threshold. Drawing another card (hitting) has a relatively high chance of increasing our score without exceeding the threshold. For example, if we draw a card with a value of 1 - 11, we will get closer to 31 without going over.\n\nSo, the best move for us in this turn is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n- Currently, your card total is 27, and the threshold N is 31. There is a difference of 4 between your total and the threshold.\n- From the history records, we can observe that the opponent has a fixed strategy of standing early.\n- Since your current total is quite close to the threshold and the risk of exceeding it by taking another card is relatively high, it is wiser to stop drawing cards.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Looking at the history, the opponent has a consistent strategy of standing very early in each round. \nOur current total is 24, and the threshold (N) is 42. There is a significant gap between our current total and the threshold, and since the opponent seems to be likely to end up with a relatively low - total hand, we have room to take more cards to get closer to the threshold without a high risk of exceeding it.

Our total score with the cards ['K', 'J', '2'] is 26.\n   - The opponent's known card is '10' and has an unknown card. In the previous 6 rounds, the opponent's strategy has been to stand in the first turn. Based on the current total of 26, we are relatively far from the threshold of 42. Drawing an additional card (hitting) has a relatively low risk of exceeding 42, and it can increase our chances of getting closer to 42.\n2. **Decision**:\n   - We should choose to hit to try to get a higher - scoring hand without exceeding 42.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\nWe currently have a total of 32 points with a threshold of 42.

So, it is still beneficial for us to try and get closer to 44.\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis: Currently, your total score is 40 and the threshold N is 44. If you hit, there is a risk of exceeding 44 and losing. The opponent's current known card is a '6', and even if the unknown card is a 'K' (the largest - value card), the maximum total is 6 + 13 = 19, which is much less than your 40. So it is more advisable to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the history, the opponent has a fixed strategy of standing in the first turn. Our current total is 15 and the threshold N is 31. There is a significant gap between our current total and the threshold, so taking an additional card (Hit) has a relatively high chance of getting closer to 31 without exceeding it.\n\nAnswer: Hit","1. **Analysis of the current situation**:\n   - The current threshold \\(N = 31\\). Your total score with the cards ['4', 'J', '10'] is 25.\n   - The opponent's known card is a '2' and there is an unknown card. Based on the opponent's past strategy, they tend to stand early.\n   - If you take a hit, there is a risk of exceeding 31. The possible card - values range from 1 (Ace) to 13 (King).\n   - If you stand, with a score of 25, and considering the opponent's past behavior of standing early, it is likely that you will win as long as the opponent's total does not exceed 31 and is less than 25.\n2. **Decision**:\n   - It is safer to stand at this point to avoid the risk of going over 31.\n\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

If you take a hit, there is a risk of exceeding 35. Since the opponent has already stood with a 'K' and an unknown card, and we don't know if the opponent has exceeded 35 or is close to it. But considering your current total of 29, standing gives you a relatively good chance. If you hit, there are many cards that could make your total exceed 35. For example, if you get a 7 or higher - value card, you will exceed 35. So, it is more advisable to stand.\n\nOutput:\nI choose to stand.\nAnswer: Stand","1. **Analysis of the current situation**:\n   - The current threshold \\(N = 49\\). Our current total score from the cards \\(['K', '4']\\) is \\(13 + 4=17\\).\n   - We are far from the threshold. Taking another card (hitting) has a high - probability of not exceeding the threshold. If we stand now, our score is 17, and there is a good chance that the opponent, who may continue to draw cards, could get closer to 49 and win.\n   - Since we have a large gap between our current total and the threshold, it is beneficial for us to try to increase our score by hitting.\n2. **Formatting the answer**:\n   The answer is to take an additional card, which is \"Hit\".\nAnswer: Hit","1. Analyze the situation:\n   - The current threshold \\(N = 49\\). Our total card value is currently \\(29\\).\n   - We know that our opponent has a 'K' (worth 13 points) and an unknown card, and they stood in the first turn. This indicates that they might think their total is close enough to \\(N\\) or they are afraid of exceeding \\(N\\).\n   - If we hit, we have a chance to get closer to \\(N\\) and increase our chances of winning. Since we are currently at 29, we can safely take a few more cards without a high - risk of exceeding 49 immediately. For example, even if we get a face - card (the highest - value non - ace card), our total will be \\(29 + 13=42\\), which is still below 49.\n2. Conclusion:\n   - Based on the above analysis, the best move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\nMy current total card value is 42, and the threshold N is 49. If I choose to hit, there is a risk of exceeding 49. The opponent has a 'K' (13 points) and an unknown card.

To get closer to the threshold N, it is a good choice to request an additional card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n- In the previous two rounds, the opponent's strategy seems to be to stand early. In the current round, the opponent has already stood twice.\n- Our current total is 17, and the threshold N is 36. We are quite far from the threshold. Since we are using an infinite - deck, drawing a new card has a relatively low risk of exceeding the threshold.\n- By hitting, we have a good chance of getting closer to the threshold N and increasing our chances of winning.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, understand the current situation:\n   - The current threshold \\(N = 36\\).\n   - Our total score is 24 with cards \\(['8', '3', '4', '2', '7']\\).\n   - The opponent has a known card '3' and an unknown card.

Consider the risk - reward of hitting:\n   - If we hit, the best - case scenario is that we get a card that brings our total close to 36 without exceeding it. For example, if we get a 10, our total will be \\(24 + 10=34\\), which is very close to 36 and likely to win.\n   - The worst - case scenario is that we exceed 36. For example, if we get a face - card (J, Q, K), our total will exceed 36 (e.g., if we get a J, \\(24 + 11 = 35\\) is still okay, but if we get a Q, \\(24+12 = 36\\) is at the limit, and if we get a K, \\(24 + 13=37\\) which exceeds 36).\n3. Analyze the opponent's situation:\n   - Since the opponent has been standing, assume their total is already close to 36. If our current total of 24 is far from the opponent's (assumed close - to - 36) total, we are likely to lose if we stand.\n   - By hitting, we have a chance to get closer to 36 and potentially win.\n\nBased on the above analysis, it is beneficial to take the risk and hit in the hope of getting a card that can bring our total closer to 36 without exceeding it.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Let's analyze whether to hit or stand.\n\nWe currently have a total of 29 points with a threshold \\(N = 36\\). If we hit, there is a risk of going over 36. The probability of getting a card that will push us over 36 depends on the card values.\n\nThe cards that will make us go over 36 are cards with a value of 8 or more (since \\(29+8 = 37\\)).\n\nIn an infinite - deck scenario, there are 52 cards in a standard deck. There are 4 cards each of 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, and A (where A = 1).\nThe number of cards with a value of 8 or more: \\(4\\times(4 + 3)=28\\) (4 each of 8, 9, 10 and 4 each of J, Q, K). The number of cards with a value of 7 or less is \\(4\\times7 = 28\\)\n\nHowever, our opponent has already stood multiple times. Given that our current total of 29 is relatively close to the threshold of 36 and we don't know the opponent's face - down card, hitting may be too risky. If we hit and go over 36, and the opponent has a total less than 36, we will lose.\n\nIf we stand, we have a good chance of winning as long as the opponent's total is less than 29 or the opponent goes over 36.\n\nSo, the better move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis:\n1. In the previous rounds, the opponent's strategy has been to stand early.\n2. Currently, our total score is 21 and the threshold N is 39. There is still a relatively large gap between our current total and the threshold.\n3. Drawing another card has a relatively high probability of increasing our score closer to the threshold without exceeding it.\n\nDecision: We should choose to 'Hit' to try to get closer to the threshold N.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis: Currently, our total card value is 30, and the threshold N is 39. There is a difference of 9 between our current total and N. The opponent stood in the first turn, and with a face - up card of 7, it's likely that the opponent's total is close to or has reached a value they think is safe. \nIf we hit, there is a chance to get closer to 39 and increase our winning probability. Since we are far from exceeding 39 currently, the risk of hitting is relatively low. \nSo, we should choose to hit.\nAnswer: Hit","Let's analyze the situation. The current total of my cards is 31, and the threshold \\(N = 39\\). The opponent's known card is a 7, and we don't know the other card. Since the opponent has already stood in the first two turns, it's very likely that their total is close to or already above a value where they think it's safe to stop.\n\nIf I stand now, my total is 31. The opponent's maximum possible total with an unknown card (assuming it's a K worth 13 points) would be \\(7 + 13=20\\).

Since aces are worth \\(1\\) point, number cards \\(2 - 6\\) will keep us under \\(28\\).\n   - The probability of getting a card that will push us over \\(28\\) (such as a \\(7\\) or higher) is lower.\n   - If we stand now, our total is \\(22\\). The opponent's total could potentially be close to \\(28\\) if their unknown card is a high - value card. By hitting, we have a chance to get closer to \\(28\\) without exceeding it.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the better move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Looking at the history, the opponent has a fixed strategy of standing in the first turn. Our current total is 11 and the threshold N is 45. We are far from the threshold, so taking an additional card (hitting) is a reasonable move as it gives us a better chance to get closer to 45 and win.\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, look at the opponent's strategy from the history. In all previous rounds, the opponent always stands in the first turn and then stands again in subsequent turns. So, it's very likely that the opponent will stand this round as well.\n2. Calculate the current total of our cards, which is 16, and the threshold N is 45. There is a large gap between our current total and the threshold.\n3. Since we have a long way to go to get closer to 45 and the opponent seems to stop drawing cards early, it is beneficial for us to draw one more card to increase our total and get closer to the threshold.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the history, the opponent seems to have a strategy of standing early.

We are quite far from the threshold, so it is beneficial to request an additional card to get closer to 45.\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the history, the opponent has a strategy of standing early. Our current total is 33 and the threshold N is 45. There is a significant gap between our current total and the threshold. We can take a risk and try to get closer to 45 by hitting. Even if we go over, the opponent's low - value face - up card '4' makes it likely that they won't have a high total if they stand early as they usually do.\n\nAnswer: Hit","1. **Analysis**:\n   - The current total of my cards is 38, and the threshold \\(N = 45\\). There is a difference of \\(45 - 38=7\\) between my current total and the threshold.\n   - Looking at the opponent's strategy from the history, the opponent has always stood in the first turn. Their known card is a '4', and the unknown card could be at most a 'K' (value 13). So the maximum possible total of the opponent's cards is \\(4 + 13=17\\).\n   - Since there is still some room to get closer to 45 without exceeding it, it is beneficial to take another card (Hit) to increase my total and get closer to the threshold.\n2. **Answer in the required format**:\nAnswer: Hit","Looking at the history, the opponent seems to have a strategy of standing early. The current total of our cards is 9 and the threshold is 33. We are far from the threshold, so it is beneficial to take a hit to get closer to the threshold and increase our chances of winning.\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, understand the current situation:\n   - The current threshold \\(N = 33\\).\n   - Our total score with the cards ['7', '2', '6'] is 15, which is far from 33.\n   - The opponent has a '4' and an unknown - card, and they stood in the first turn.\n2. Analyze the opponent's strategy based on the history:\n   - In all previous rounds, the opponent always stands in the first turn and then stands in subsequent turns. This indicates that the opponent has a very conservative strategy, likely trying to avoid going over the threshold.\n3. Evaluate the benefit of hitting:\n   - Since our current total is only 15, hitting a card is very likely to get us closer to the threshold of 33 without going over it. For example, if we get a card from 2 - 18 (in value), we will still be under 33.\n   - Given the infinite deck, the probability of getting a card that will make us go over 33 is relatively low at this stage.\n\nBased on the above analysis, it is beneficial for us to hit in this turn.\n\nAnswer: Hit","1. **Analysis of the situation**:\n   - The current threshold \\(N = 33\\). Our current card total is \\(20\\), and the opponent has a face - up \\(4\\) and an unknown card.\n   - Looking at the history, the opponent seems to have a strategy of standing early.\n   - If we hit, there is a chance to get closer to \\(33\\) without exceeding it. For example, if we get a card from \\(2 - 13\\), our new total will be between \\(22\\) and \\(33\\) (assuming we don't exceed \\(33\\)).\n   - Since our current total of \\(20\\) is quite far from \\(33\\), and the opponent may have a relatively low total based on their early - standing strategy, hitting gives us a better chance to win.\n2. **Output in the required format**:\nAnswer: Hit","1. **Analysis of the situation**:\n   - The current total of your cards is 27, and the threshold \\(N = 33\\). So, you are 6 points away from the threshold.\n   - The opponent has a face - up card of 4 and an unknown card. From the history, we can observe that the opponent has a strategy of standing early.\n   - If you take a hit, the probability of getting a card that makes your total exceed 33 needs to be considered. The cards that would make you exceed 33 are 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K. There are 7 types of such cards. Since we are using an infinite deck, the probability of getting a card that makes you exceed 33 is \\(\\frac{7}{13}\\approx0.54\\).\n   - If you stand, the opponent's total with the unknown card is unknown. But considering the opponent's early - standing strategy, it is likely that their total is not very high. If you stand with 27, and the opponent's total is less than 27, you win. If the opponent's total is also less than 33 but greater than 27, you lose.\n   - Standing at this point gives you a relatively stable situation as you are already close to the threshold without taking the risk of exceeding it.\n2. **Decision**:\n   - Based on the above analysis, the better move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis:\n1.

So, I suggest taking a Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Looking at the history, we can analyze the opponent's strategy. In most rounds, the opponent keeps hitting until they reach a certain point and then stand. \n\nIn the current round, our total is 19 and the threshold is 38. We still have a lot of room to get closer to 38 without exceeding it. Since we are far from the threshold and considering that we want to get a total as close to 38 as possible without going over, it is a good idea to take another card. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the history, the opponent seems to be quite aggressive in taking hits. Our current total is 24 and the threshold is 38, so we have a lot of room to get closer to the threshold. By taking a hit, we have a good chance of getting closer to 38 without exceeding it.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n- Our current total is 26 and the threshold N is 38. We still have a relatively large gap to reach the threshold.\n- Looking at the opponent's face - up card which is 7, we don't know their total yet, but there is a high chance that hitting for us will not cause us to exceed 38.\n- Based on the previous rounds, hitting seems to be a good strategy as we have won most rounds by carefully increasing our total. So, we should hit to get closer to the threshold of 38.\n\nAnswer: Hit","First, let's analyze the situation. The current total of our cards is 31, and the threshold N is 38. The opponent has already stood, and we need to decide whether to hit or stand.\n\nIf we hit:\n - There is a chance that the new - drawn card will make our total exceed 38. For example, if we draw a face - card (J = 11, Q = 12, K = 13) or a 10, we will lose. The probability of drawing a card that will make us exceed 38 is relatively high. Since we are currently at 31, drawing a card with a value of 8 or more will make us go over 38.\n - The opponent's current visible card is 7, and we don't know the other cards. But they have already decided to stand, which might indicate that they are close to 38 without exceeding it.\n\nIf we stand:\n - Our total is 31. There is a good chance that the opponent's total will either exceed 38 or be less than 31. Based on the history of the opponent's actions, they seem to be quite aggressive in hitting, and since they stopped at turn 5, there is a possibility that they are close to or have exceeded 38.\n\nSo, it is a safer option to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","1. **Analysis**:\n   - First, let's look at the opponent's strategy based on the history. In all previous rounds, the opponent always takes at least one hit in each round.\n   - Our current total is 18 with a threshold \\(N = 30\\). We have some room to take a hit and get closer to 30 without exceeding it easily. Since we have a good chance of improving our hand and the opponent is likely to keep hitting, taking a hit is a reasonable move.\n2. **Answer in the required format**:\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, understand the opponent's behavior from the history:\n   - In previous rounds, the opponent often continues to hit. For example, in Round 1, the opponent hit 4 times; in Round 2, the opponent hit 3 times; in Round 3, the opponent hit 2 times; in Round 5, the opponent hit 5 times; in Round 6, the opponent hit 4 times.\n   - Our current total is 19, and the threshold \\(N = 30\\). There is still a relatively large gap between our current total and the threshold.\n2. Consider the risk - reward:\n   - If we hit, there is a chance to get a card that can bring our total closer to 30 without exceeding it. Since the deck is infinite, the probability of getting a card that does not cause us to exceed 30 is relatively high. For example, getting a 2 - 11 card will not make us exceed 30 immediately.\n   - If we stand now, the opponent, with their tendency to hit multiple times, may get a better total and win the round.\n\nBased on the above analysis, it is a good choice to hit in this situation.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the history, the opponent seems to be quite aggressive in taking hits. Our current total is 11, which is far from the threshold of 32. So, it is beneficial for us to take a hit to get closer to the threshold.\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, let's analyze the opponent's behavior in previous rounds. The opponent generally keeps hitting in most rounds until they stand. \n2. In this current round, the threshold \\(N = 32\\), and our current total is 16. There is still a relatively large gap from 32. \n3. Given that we are far from the threshold and considering the opponent's tendency to keep hitting in previous rounds, we have a good chance of getting closer to 32 without exceeding it by taking another card. So, it is advisable to choose to 'Hit'.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Let's analyze the situation. The current threshold \\(N = 32\\), and our total is 28. We are relatively close to the threshold.\n\nLooking at the opponent's known card, they have an '8'. Since we don't know the values of their other three cards, there is a risk that they may have a total close to or above 32.\n\nIf we hit, there is a chance that we may exceed 32 and lose. For example, if we draw a card with a value of 5 or more, we will go over 32.\n\nSince our current total of 28 is already quite close to 32, and we don't want to risk going over, it is a safer strategy to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the history, the opponent seems to be quite aggressive in taking hits. The current total of my cards is 20 and the threshold is 44. I still have a large gap to reach the threshold, so it is a good idea to take another card to get closer to 44.\nAnswer: Hit","Looking at the history, the opponent seems to be quite aggressive in taking hits. Currently, our total is 29 and the threshold is 44, so we still have a lot of room to get closer to 44. If we stand now, there's a high chance the opponent will keep hitting and potentially get closer to 44 than us or just not exceed 44 while we are far from it.\n\nBy taking another hit, we have a good chance of getting closer to 44 without exceeding it immediately. So, the better move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","1. **Analysis of the situation**:\n   - Our current total is 35, and the threshold \\(N = 44\\). We have some room to draw another card without exceeding the threshold easily.\n   - Looking at the opponent's strategy from the history, the opponent usually keeps hitting until the end of the round. The opponent currently has an 'A' and three unknown - cards.\n   - The risk of hitting for us is relatively low. If we hit and get a card with a value such that our total does not exceed 44, we can get closer to the threshold and increase our chance of winning. For example, if we get a card with a value less than or equal to 9 (since \\(35 + 9=44\\)), we will be in a good position.\n2. **Decision**:\n   - Based on the above analysis, it is a good idea to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Since your total score of 48 has already exceeded the threshold of 44, no matter what the opponent's final score is, there are only two situations: either the opponent also exceeds 44, resulting in a draw; or the opponent does not exceed 44, and you lose. In either case, it is not beneficial for you to hit again. So you should stand.\nAnswer: Stand","Since your total is already 48 which exceeds the threshold of 44, you will lose if the opponent does not exceed 44. However, if the opponent also exceeds 44, it will be a draw. Looking at the opponent's current visible card which is an 'A' (worth 1 point), it's very likely that they will not exceed 44 as they have many cards yet to be revealed and they are still hitting. So, the most likely outcome is that you lose this round.\nAnswer: Lose","Analysis: You have already exceeded the threshold of 44 (your total is 48). The opponent has an Ace, but the other 5 cards are unknown. If the opponent's total does not exceed 44, the opponent wins; if the opponent also exceeds 44, it's a draw. Since there is a possibility that the opponent's total does not exceed 44, and you have already exceeded 44, it's very likely that you will lose this round.\nAnswer: Lose","Analysis: You have already exceeded the threshold of 44 (your total is 48). Now, it depends on whether the opponent will also exceed 44. However, regardless of what the opponent does next, if the opponent does not exceed 44, the opponent wins; if the opponent also exceeds 44, it's a draw. In either case, requesting an additional card (Hit) for you will not improve your situation. So, the better move is to Stand.\nAnswer: Stand","Since your total score is already 48 which exceeds the threshold N = 44, no matter what the opponent's final score is, if the opponent does not exceed 44, you will lose; if the opponent also exceeds 44, it will be a draw. There is no situation where you can win. Continuing to play more cards will not change the fact that you have already exceeded the threshold. So the best move is to Stand.\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the history, the opponent seems to have a tendency to keep hitting until a relatively high total. Since our current total is 13 and the threshold is 43, we have a lot of room to increase our score. So, it is a good idea to hit in this turn.\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, let's understand the opponent's general behavior from the history. The opponent usually takes multiple hits in each round, indicating a relatively aggressive strategy of trying to get a high - scoring hand.\n2. Currently, our total is 22 and the threshold \\(N = 43\\). There is still a significant gap between our current total and the threshold.\n3. Given that the opponent is aggressive, we need to try to get closer to the threshold without exceeding it.

If you stand, and the opponent hits and gets a total between \\(26\\) and \\(29\\), you will lose. However, if you hit and get a card with a value of \\(1\\) to \\(4\\), you can increase your chances of winning without exceeding \\(29\\).\n   - Since the deck is infinite, the probability of getting a card with a value of \\(1\\) to \\(4\\) is \\(\\frac{4}{13}\\) (4 aces, 4 twos, 4 threes, 4 fours out of 52 cards in a standard deck, and with an infinite deck, the probability remains the same for each draw). And there is a non - negligible chance that the opponent will hit and exceed \\(29\\) if you stand. So, it is a better strategy to hit.\n2. **Output in the required format**:\nAnswer: Hit","Since my current card total is already 29, which is equal to the threshold (N = 29). If I hit and get an additional card, there is a very high chance that my total will exceed 29 and I will lose. So, the best move is to stand.\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the history, the opponent seems to be quite aggressive in taking hits. Currently, our total is 16 and the threshold is 29. There is still a significant gap to reach the threshold, and considering the opponent's past behavior, it is beneficial for us to take a hit to get closer to the threshold.\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. We first analyze the opponent's strategy based on the history.\n   - In the first round with \\(N = 43\\), the opponent hit multiple times and then stood. In the second round with \\(N = 43\\), the opponent hit multiple times and then stood. In the third round with \\(N = 29\\), the opponent hit twice and then stood.\n   - It seems that the opponent generally hits a few times and then stands.\n2. Our current total is 18 with \\(N = 29\\). There is still a relatively large gap between our current total and the threshold \\(N\\).\n   - If we hit, there is a good chance that we can get closer to 29 without exceeding it. The probability of getting a card that will make our total exceed 29 immediately is relatively low. For example, we would need a card with a value of 12 or more to exceed 29 right away. Since we are drawing from an infinite - deck, the probability of getting such a high - value card is not very high.\n   - If we stand now, with our total of 18, the opponent may have a better chance of getting closer to 29 than us if they continue to hit according to their previous strategy.\n\nSo, the better move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","1. **Analysis**:\n   - Our current total is 27, and the threshold \\(N = 29\\). If we hit, there is a risk of exceeding 29. For example, if we draw a card with a value of 3 or more, we will go over the limit.\n   - Looking at the opponent's strategy from the previous rounds, in all previous rounds where the opponent had a chance to hit in the current - like situation, they continued to hit. But we don't know the opponent's total. However, our total of 27 is already quite close to 29.\n   - If we stand, we are in a relatively good position. The opponent may continue to hit and exceed 29. Even if the opponent doesn't exceed 29, it will be difficult for them to get closer to 29 than our 27.\n2. **Decision**:\n   - Based on the above analysis, it is better for us to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the history, the opponent seems to be quite aggressive in taking hits. Currently, our total is 17 and the threshold is 40. We are far from the threshold, so it is beneficial for us to take another card to get closer to 40.\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n- We first look at the opponent's strategy from the history. In previous rounds, the opponent usually keeps hitting until they stand.\n- Currently, our total score is 20, and the threshold \\(N = 40\\). We still have a lot of room to get closer to 40 without exceeding it.\n- Since we are far from the threshold, it is beneficial for us to request an additional card (Hit) to increase our score and get closer to 40.\n\nAnswer: Hit","First, let's analyze the situation. The threshold \\(N = 40\\), and our current total is 33. We are relatively close to the threshold.\n\nLooking at the opponent's cards, they have a 'K' (worth 13 points) already, and they are still hitting. From the history, we can observe that the opponent seems to be quite aggressive in taking cards.\n\nIf we take another card (Hit), there is a risk of going over 40. But considering the opponent's aggressive strategy, they might end up going over 40 as well. Also, we are 7 points away from the threshold, and there are many cards in the deck that can be added without going over.\n\nIf we stand now, the opponent might still keep hitting and get a total closer to 40 than ours without going over.\n\nSo, it is a good idea to take another card to try to get closer to 40.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis: My current card total is 37, which is quite close to the threshold N = 40. If I take another hit, there is a high probability that I will exceed 40 and lose. Looking at the opponent's known card, they have a 'K' (worth 13 points). Since their other cards are unknown, they may still have a chance to exceed 40 if they continue to draw cards. Standing at this moment gives me a relatively high chance of winning as long as the opponent exceeds 40. So, I should choose to stand.\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the history, the opponent seems to be quite aggressive in taking hits. With our current total of 8 and a threshold of 24, we are far from the limit. Taking a hit gives us a good chance to get closer to 24 without exceeding it. So, I suggest we take a hit.\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. The current threshold \\(N = 24\\), and our current card total is 11. There is still a large gap from 24, so it is beneficial for us to take another card to get closer to the threshold.\n2. Looking at the opponent's known card, the 7 - point card is not a very high - value card, and we have no clear indication that the opponent's total is close to 24. So, it is a good choice for us to hit to increase our chances of winning.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. Our current total score is 23, which is very close to the threshold \\(N = 24\\).\n2. If we take a hit, there is a high risk of exceeding 24. For example, even the lowest - value card (an Ace) would not make the situation better, and any other card would cause us to exceed 24.\n3. The opponent has already stood, and we currently have a total of 23 which is close to 24. As long as we don't exceed 24, we have a good chance of winning.\n\nSo, the best move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis:\n- First, calculate the current total of our cards, which is 22. The threshold \\(N = 26\\), so we are 4 points away from the threshold.\n- Looking at the opponent's strategy in previous rounds, the opponent often takes multiple hits in each round until they either exceed the threshold or get close enough to stop. The opponent has a 'J' (worth 11 points) showing, and with an unknown card, it's very likely that they will continue to hit to get closer to the threshold.\n- If we stand now with a total of 22, there is a good chance that the opponent will be able to get closer to 26 than us. For example, if the opponent's unknown card is a low - value card, they can hit more times to get a total closer to 26.\n- If we hit, although there is a risk of exceeding 26, the probability of getting a card that allows us to get closer to 26 is relatively high. Since we are only 4 points away from 26, getting a card with a value of 1 - 4 will help us get closer to the winning total.\n\nSo, the better move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\nMy current total is 24, which is already quite close to the threshold of 26. If I hit, there is a high risk of exceeding 26. Looking at the opponent's known card 'J' (worth 11 points), even with two unknown cards, it's hard to predict exactly how their total will turn out. But considering my current situation, it's safer to stand and not take the risk of going over the limit.\n\nAnswer: Stand","1. Analyze the situation:\n   - The current threshold \\(N = 37\\). Our current total is 22.\n   - Looking at the opponent's history, the opponent usually takes multiple hits in the early - stage of the game. For example, in most previous rounds, the opponent hit multiple times before standing.\n   - Since our current total of 22 is relatively far from the threshold of 37, taking another card (Hit) gives us a good chance to get closer to 37 without exceeding it easily. If we stand now, our total is 22, and the opponent may be able to get closer to 37 than us by taking more cards.\n2. Make a decision:\n   - Based on the above analysis, the better move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","1. **Analysis**:\n   - The current total of my cards is 30, and the threshold \\(N = 37\\). There is a difference of \\(37 - 30=7\\) points between my current total and the threshold.\n   - Looking at the opponent's visible card, they have a 'K' (worth 13 points). Even if the two unknown cards are the lowest - value aces (1 point each), their minimum total is \\(13 + 1+1 = 15\\).\n   - From the history, we can observe that the opponent often hits multiple times in a round. Given that my current total is relatively close to the threshold and there is a risk of exceeding it if I hit again, and considering the opponent's general behavior of trying to get a higher score, it seems reasonable to stand at this point.\n2. **Answer in the required format**:\nAnswer: Stand","Looking at the history, the opponent seems to continue hitting until they either reach a relatively high - value hand or exceed the threshold.

The opponent has a Jack (worth 11 points) and an unknown card, and the opponent has already chosen to stand.\n\nIf we choose to stand, our score remains 24.

Drawing an additional card (Hit) has a high probability of not exceeding 45 and can increase my total to get closer to 45, which will improve my winning - chance in this round.\n\nAnswer: Hit\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n- Currently, our total score is 24, and the threshold N is 45. There is still a large gap between our current score and the threshold.\n- The opponent stood in the first - turn, which might indicate that they think their current score is close to the threshold or they are afraid of exceeding it.\n- Since we have a lot of room to increase our score without exceeding 45, hitting is a reasonable choice as it gives us a chance to get closer to 45.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, consider the current situation. The threshold \\(N = 45\\). My current total is 27, and the opponent has stood in the previous two turns with a known card of 4 and an unknown card.\n2. Analyze the potential of getting a card. Since we are using an infinite - deck, there is a good chance of getting a card that can increase my total closer to 45 without exceeding it. For example, getting a number card from 2 - 10 will safely increase my score.\n3. Consider the opponent's situation. The opponent has already stood, which might indicate that they are afraid of exceeding 45. Their current known total is at least 4, and we assume their total is likely to be relatively low as they stood early.\n4. By hitting, I have a high probability of getting closer to 45 and potentially winning the round. If I stand now, my total of 27 may be too far from 45 compared to what the opponent might have.\n\nSo, the best move is to Hit.\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n- Currently, your card total is 38 and the threshold N is 45. If you take a Hit, there is a risk of exceeding 45. Since your total is already relatively close to 45, and the opponent has only shown a 4 with an unknown card, standing at this point is a relatively safe strategy. If you stand, as long as the opponent's total does not exceed 45 and is closer to 45 than your 38, you have a good chance of winning. If you take a Hit and go over 45, you will likely lose or draw.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis: Currently, my total score is 8, which is far from the threshold of 32. There is a high chance that taking another card will not cause me to exceed 32 and will get me closer to 32, increasing my probability of winning. So, I should choose to hit.\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, understand the current situation:\n   - The threshold \\(N = 32\\).\n   - My current total card - value is 10, and I have room to take more cards without exceeding 32.\n   - The opponent has already stood on the first turn, and one of their cards is a 5. We don't know the other card, but since they stood, their total might be close to 32 or they think they have a good chance of winning.\n2. Evaluate the option of hitting:\n   - Since my current total is only 10, there is a very low risk of exceeding 32 by taking one more card. The worst - case scenario with a face - card (value 13) would give me a total of \\(10 + 13=23\\), which is still far from 32.\n   - By hitting, I have a good chance of getting closer to 32 and increasing my chances of winning.\n3. Evaluate the option of standing:\n   - If I stand now with a total of 10, the opponent's total might be much closer to 32. For example, if the opponent's unknown card is a face - card (value 11, 12, or 13), their total would be \\(5+11 = 16\\), \\(5 + 12=17\\), or \\(5+13 = 18\\) at least, and they are likely to be closer to 32 than me.\n\nBased on the above analysis, I should choose to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","1. **Analysis of the situation**:\n   - The current total of my cards is 21, and the threshold \\(N = 32\\). There is a significant gap between my current total and the threshold, so there is room to take an additional card without a high - risk of exceeding the threshold immediately.\n   - The opponent has stood in the previous two turns. The visible card of the opponent is 5. Since the opponent has already stood, it is likely that the total of the opponent's cards is relatively close to the threshold or they think they have a good hand. However, we don't know the value of the face - down card.\n   - By taking an additional card (hitting), we have a chance to get closer to the threshold of 32 and potentially increase our chances of winning.\n2. **Decision**:\n   - Based on the above analysis, I should choose to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis: My current card total is already 32, which is exactly equal to the threshold N.

There is a significant gap between our current total and the threshold. By taking an additional card (Hit), we have a high chance of getting a card that will increase our total closer to 49 without exceeding it. Since we start from a relatively low total, the risk of going over 49 is relatively small compared to the potential gain of getting closer to the target.\nAnswer: Hit","First, let's analyze the situation. Our current total is 21 and the threshold N is 49. We have a lot of room to draw more cards without exceeding the threshold. Since we want to get as close to 49 as possible, taking another card (Hit) is a reasonable choice. \n\nAnswer: Hit","1. **Analysis of the situation**:\n   - Currently, our total score is 28, and the threshold \\(N = 49\\). There is still a relatively large gap between our current score and the threshold.\n   - We know very little about the opponent's cards. The opponent has one face - up 6, and the other three cards are unknown.\n   - Since we are far from the threshold, taking another card (hitting) has a relatively low risk of exceeding the threshold, and it can increase our chances of getting closer to 49.\n2. **Decision**:\n   - We should choose to take another card, i.e., \"Hit\".\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n- Your current card total is 39, and the threshold N is 49. There is a gap of 49 - 39 = 10 between your total and the threshold.\n- Since you don't know the opponent's situation exactly but they have at least one 6 and four unknown cards, they might potentially get a high - value hand.\n- By standing now, you lock in your score of 39. If you hit, there is a risk of exceeding 49. Given that your current total is relatively far from 49 but still at a safe distance, hitting might be a good option to get closer to 49 and increase your chances of winning.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Your current total is 40 and the threshold N is 49. If you hit, there is a risk of exceeding 49, but since you don't know the opponent's total and they still have multiple unknown cards, there is a chance they could get a high - scoring hand. However, your current total is already relatively close to 49. Standing at this point gives you a good chance of not exceeding 49.\nOutput format:\nI recommend you Stand.\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis: Currently, the total value of my cards is 15, and the threshold N is 32. There is still a lot of room to draw a card without exceeding the limit. Drawing a card has a high probability of getting closer to the threshold N, which can increase the chance of winning. So, I should choose to hit.\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n- Currently, our total score is 20, and the threshold N is 32. We are relatively far from the threshold.\n- In the first round, the opponent kept hitting even when the situation was getting close to the threshold. This indicates that the opponent has an aggressive strategy of trying to get as close to the threshold as possible by continuously taking cards.\n- If we stand now, with a score of 20, the opponent may keep hitting and have a high chance of getting a score closer to 32 or even a score within the limit that is higher than ours.\n- By hitting, we have a chance to increase our score closer to 32 without exceeding it. For example, if we get a card with a value of 1 - 12, our score will still be within the limit and closer to 32.\n\nSo, the better move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Since my current total is already exactly equal to the threshold N = 32, if I hit, there is a high chance that I will exceed 32 and lose. So, I should stand.\nAnswer: Stand","Looking at the history, the opponent seems to be quite aggressive in taking hits. In the current round, our total is only 8 and the threshold is 37. We are far from the threshold, so it is beneficial for us to take another card to get closer to the threshold.\nAnswer: Hit","1. **Analysis**:\n   - In the previous two rounds, the opponent seemed to keep hitting until either exceeding the threshold or stopping. \n   - Our current total is 19, and the threshold is 37. There is a significant gap between our current total and the threshold, so it is beneficial for us to try to get closer to the threshold.\n   - We have enough room to take another card without a high - risk of exceeding the threshold immediately.\n2. **Answer in the required format**:\nAnswer: Hit","1. **Analysis of the situation**:\n   - **Your current total**: Your cards are ['A', '7', 'J', '5'] with a total of 24, and the threshold \\(N = 37\\). So, you are \\(37 - 24=13\\) points away from the threshold.\n   - **Opponent's situation**: The opponent has a face - up 'K' (worth 13 points). We don't know the values of the other three cards, but in the previous two rounds, the opponent kept hitting until they either went over the threshold or stopped very close to going over.\n   - **Risk - reward assessment**:\n     - If you hit, there is a chance to get a card that will bring you closer to 37 without going over. For example, getting a 2 - 13 card (except a card that would make the total exceed 37) would be beneficial. The probability of getting a card that won't make you go over 37 is relatively high. Since we are using an infinite deck, the probability of getting a card that will make you go over 37 (a card with a value of \\(37 - 24+1 = 14\\) or more, which is not possible in our card - value system) is 0 in a non - error sense.\n     - If you stand, given the opponent's previous behavior of being aggressive in hitting, there is a high chance that the opponent will continue to hit and may get a total closer to 37 or even exceed it. But you are leaving potential points on the table by not trying to get closer to 37.\n2. **Decision**:\n   - It is more beneficial to hit. By hitting, you can increase your total and have a better chance of getting closer to 37 without going over, which will improve your chances of winning the round.\n\nOutput in the required format:\nAnswer: Hit","1. **Analysis of the situation**:\n   - Our current total is 28, and the threshold \\(N = 37\\). So we have a buffer of \\(37 - 28=9\\) points before we exceed the threshold.\n   - Looking at the opponent's visible card, they have a 'K' which is worth 13 points. Since we don't know their other cards, we can assume that they might be trying to get close to 37 as well.\n   - From the history, in Round 1 when the threshold was 49, the opponent kept hitting until they went over. In Round 2 when the threshold was 32, they also hit multiple times. This indicates that the opponent has an aggressive strategy of hitting until they either get close to or exceed the threshold.\n   - If we hit, there is a chance to get closer to 37. The probability of getting a card that won't make us go over 37 is relatively high. For example, if we get a card with a value of 9 or less, we will still be within the threshold.\n2. **Decision - Hit**:\n   - By hitting, we can potentially increase our score to get closer to 37 and have a better chance of winning compared to standing at 28. There is a risk of going over 37, but considering the opponent's aggressive strategy, it is worth taking the risk to try and get a better score.\n\nAnswer: Hit","1. Analyze the situation:\n   - Your current total is 31, and the threshold \\(N = 37\\). There is a difference of \\(37 - 31=6\\) points between your current total and the threshold.\n   - The opponent has a face - up King (worth 13 points) and four unknown cards. The opponent has already decided to stand in the previous turn.\n   - From the history, we can observe that the opponent seems to be more aggressive in taking cards. In Round 1, the opponent kept hitting even when you had already stopped, and in Round 2, the opponent also took multiple cards.\n   - If you hit, there is a risk of exceeding 37. The probability of getting a card with a value of 7 or more will make you exceed the threshold. But if you stand, you are at a relatively safe position of 31 points, and we need to rely on the opponent's total to determine the outcome. Since the opponent has already stood, it is likely that their total is close to or has exceeded 37.\n2. Decision:\n   - Based on the above analysis, it is better to stand. Standing ensures that you do not exceed the threshold on your own, and we can wait to see if the opponent has exceeded the threshold or is closer to 37.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the history, the opponent seems to keep hitting until their total gets relatively high and often ends up exceeding the threshold. My current total is 11 and the threshold is 33. There is a large gap, so it is beneficial for me to hit to get closer to the threshold.\nAnswer: Hit","1. Analyze the situation:\n   - We know from the history that the opponent has a tendency to keep hitting even when it might be risky. In previous rounds, the opponent often continued to take cards until they exceeded the threshold.\n   - Our current total is 15, and the threshold \\(N = 33\\). We still have a lot of room to increase our score without exceeding the threshold.\n   - Since the opponent seems to have a risky - hitting strategy, we can try to get closer to the threshold \\(N = 33\\) to increase our chances of winning.\n2. Decision:\n   - We should choose to hit to get closer to the threshold of 33.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, look at the opponent's strategy based on the history. In previous rounds, the opponent generally keeps hitting until the last few turns. \n2. Our current total is 17, and the threshold N is 33. We still have a lot of room to get closer to 33.\n3. If we stand now, our total is 17. The opponent may continue to hit and get a better score close to 33.\n4. If we hit, we have a chance to increase our score to be closer to 33 without exceeding it easily.\n\nSo, the better move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. Look at the history of previous rounds:\n   - In all previous rounds, the opponent kept hitting until a relatively high - value hand. For example, in Round 1, the opponent hit until the total exceeded 53 with a threshold of 49; in Round 2, the opponent hit until the total was 36 with a threshold of 32; in Round 3, the opponent hit until the total was 39 with a threshold of 37.\n2. Consider the current situation:\n   - The current threshold \\(N = 33\\), and our current total is 22. There is still a relatively large gap between our total and the threshold. Since the opponent has a tendency to keep hitting based on previous rounds, we can also try to get closer to the threshold.\n3. Evaluate the decision:\n   - If we hit, there is a chance to increase our total closer to 33 without exceeding it. For example, if we get a card with a value of 1 - 11, our total will still be within the limit and closer to the target.\n\nSo, the better move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n- Currently, your total card value is 32 and the threshold N is 33. If you hit, there is a high risk of exceeding 33 and losing the round.\n- The opponent has already stood in the previous turn. Since we don't know the opponent's total, but our current total is very close to 33. Standing gives us a good chance of winning as long as the opponent either exceeds 33 or has a lower total.\n\nSo, the best move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the opponent's previous strategy, in most rounds, the opponent keeps hitting until relatively late in the game.

If we hit, there is a high risk of exceeding 38 as even a card with a value of 3 or more will make us go over the limit.

If you hit, there is a risk of exceeding 49 as any card drawn has a non - zero chance of pushing your total over the limit. Since your total is already relatively close to 49, it is more prudent to stand and see how the opponent's cards turn out.\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis:\n1. First, calculate the current situation:\n   - The current threshold \\(N = 41\\).\n   - Your current total score is \\(24\\) with cards \\(['K', 'J']\\).\n   - The opponent's known card is a \\(10\\), and the other card is unknown.\n2. Analyze the decision - making based on the history:\n   - In the previous round, the threshold was \\(49\\). Both you and the opponent kept hitting multiple times. Eventually, your total was \\(43\\) and the opponent's was \\(44\\).\n   - In the current round, your current total of \\(24\\) is relatively far from the threshold of \\(41\\). If you stand now, there is a high chance that the opponent can get closer to \\(41\\) by hitting cards.\n   - Since you are far from the threshold, taking another card (hitting) has a relatively low risk of exceeding \\(41\\) at this stage.\n\nSo, the better move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","1. Analyze the situation:\n   - The current threshold \\(N = 41\\). Our current card total is \\(34\\).\n   - From the previous round, we can see that the opponent seems to be quite aggressive in taking cards as they kept hitting until the 8 - turn in the first round.\n   - If we hit, there is a chance to get a card that can bring our total closer to \\(41\\) without exceeding it. For example, if we get an Ace (\\(1\\) point), \\(2\\), \\(3\\), \\(4\\), \\(5\\), \\(6\\), \\(7\\) cards, our total will still be within the limit and closer to \\(41\\). The risk of exceeding \\(41\\) is relatively small compared to the potential gain of getting closer to the target.\n   - Standing at \\(34\\) might result in losing if the opponent manages to get a total closer to \\(41\\) by taking more cards.\n2. Conclusion:\n   - Based on the analysis, the better move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Since my total score of 43 has already exceeded the threshold (N = 41), it doesn't matter whether I hit or stand. Standing is a better option as there's no point in taking more cards when I've already lost. So, I should choose to stand.\nAnswer: Stand","Since your total score is already 43 which exceeds the threshold (N = 41), no matter what the opponent does, if they don't exceed 41, they will win and if they also exceed 41, it will be a draw. So the best move for you is to stand as you have already lost the possibility of winning by not exceeding the threshold.\nAnswer: Stand","Looking at the history, in Round 1, the opponent kept hitting until the end and got a total close to the threshold. In Round 2, the opponent also kept hitting even when the player had already stood. \n\nFor the current round, with a threshold of 28 and my current total of 12, it is quite far from the threshold. Hitting has a high chance of getting closer to 28 without exceeding it. Given the opponent's past behavior of aggressive hitting, I should also try to get a higher total. So, I choose to hit.\nAnswer: Hit","1. Analyze the situation:\n   - The current threshold \\(N = 28\\). Your current card total is 25. If you hit, there is a risk of exceeding 28.\n   - Looking at the opponent's situation, they have a 4 and two unknown cards. Their current total is unknown, but they might be trying to get close to 28 as well.\n   - In the previous rounds, the opponent seemed to be quite aggressive in taking hits. In Round 1, they hit until the 8 - th turn, and in Round 2, they continued to hit after you had already stood.\n   - Since your current total of 25 is relatively close to 28, and hitting has a high risk of going over 28, it is wiser to stand.\n2. Output in the required format:\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the history, when the threshold is relatively low (like in Round 3 with N = 28), it's beneficial to get closer to the threshold. Currently, our total is 16 and the threshold is 26. We still have a good margin to draw a card without exceeding the threshold easily. So, it is a good idea to take a Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Let's analyze the situation. We currently have a total of 23 points with a threshold (N) of 26. If we hit, there is a chance to get closer to 26 and potentially win, but there is also a risk of exceeding 26 and losing.\n\nLooking at the opponent's strategy from the previous rounds, they seem to be quite aggressive in taking hits. In Round 1, they hit multiple times; in Round 2, they continued to hit even after we had already stood; in Round 3, they took at least one hit.\n\nOur current total of 23 is quite close to the threshold of 26. If we hit, there is a relatively high probability of going over 26 considering the range of card values. For example, if we get a 4 or higher, we will exceed 26.\n\nSince we are already close to 26 and the opponent has an aggressive strategy which might lead them to exceed 26, it is a safer option to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis:\n- Currently, my total score is 16 and the threshold N is 38. There is still a large gap between my current score and the threshold.\n- Looking at the opponent's strategy from the previous rounds, the opponent often chooses to hit in the early - stage turns.\n- Since I am far from the threshold, taking another card (hitting) gives me a better chance to get closer to the threshold N = 38 without exceeding it immediately.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n- Currently, our total score is 21 with a threshold (N) of 38. We still have a relatively large gap from the threshold.\n- Looking at the opponent's previous strategies, in most cases, the opponent continues to hit until relatively late in the game.\n- Since we are far from the threshold, it is beneficial for us to try to get closer to 38 by hitting another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, understand the current situation:\n   - The threshold \\(N = 38\\).\n   - Your total card - value is 34, which is 4 points away from the threshold.\n   - The opponent has one known card '5', and three unknown cards.\n2. Analyze the opponent's strategy based on history:\n   - In previous rounds, the opponent often continues to hit. For example, in Round 1, the opponent hit until the 8th turn; in Round 2, the opponent hit after you stood.\n   - It is very likely that the opponent will keep hitting in this round as well.\n3. Evaluate the risk of hitting:\n   - If you hit, there is a chance that you may exceed 38. But considering the opponent's tendency to keep hitting, if you stand now, the opponent may get a total closer to 38.\n   - Since your current total is 34, if you get a card with a value of 5 or more, you will exceed 38. However, getting a card of value 1 - 4 will improve your position. In an infinite deck, there are relatively more low - value cards.\n4. Decision - making:\n   - Standing now means you take a passive stance, and the opponent has a good chance to get closer to 38. Hitting gives you a chance to get closer to 38 without exceeding it. So, it is more advisable to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Since my current total is already 38 which is equal to the threshold (N), if I hit, there is a high chance of exceeding 38 and losing.

For example, in Round 1, they took hits for 8 turns, in Round 2 they took hits even after we had already stood.\n\nOur current total of 25 is relatively far from the threshold of 41. There is a good chance that taking another card won't make us exceed 41, and it will increase our chances of getting closer to 41 and potentially beating the opponent.\n\nSo, the better move for us is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","1. **Analysis**:\n   - Our current total is 32 and the threshold \\(N = 41\\). There is still some room to get closer to 41 without exceeding it.\n   - Looking at the opponent's known card, they have a 'J' (worth 11 points). Even with the unknown cards, we don't know if they have already reached or exceeded 41. But since we are at 32, taking another card has a relatively high chance of getting us closer to 41 without going over.

The opponent's known card is a 'J' (worth 11 points). We don't know the values of the other 5 unknown cards. But generally, the opponent may try to get closer to 41.\n3. If you choose to hit, there is a risk of exceeding 41. For example, if you draw a card with a value of 4 or more, you will lose immediately.\n4.

There is still a significant gap between my current total and the threshold, so it is beneficial to draw another card to get closer to the threshold.\n- Looking at the opponent's situation, with only a 2 showing and an unknown card, it's hard to accurately judge their total. But regardless, increasing my own total is a reasonable choice at this stage.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\nWe currently have a total of 38 points with a threshold N of 44. The difference between our current total and the threshold is 44 - 38 = 6. \nLooking at the opponent's known card, they only have a 2 so far. We know that the opponent has a fixed strategy. From the history, we can see that the opponent often hits multiple times. Since our current total is relatively close to the threshold and there is a risk of exceeding it if we hit again, while the opponent's known score is far from the threshold and they are likely to continue hitting to get closer to or exceed the threshold. So, it is a good choice for us to stand at this time.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the history, the opponent seems to be quite aggressive in taking hits. Currently, our total is 7 and the threshold is 24. We are far from the threshold, so it's a good idea to take a hit to increase our score and get closer to the threshold.\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, understand the current situation:\n   - The threshold \\(N = 24\\).\n   - Your current card total is 10, which is far from 24.\n   - Looking at the opponent's known card, they have a 9. Since we don't know the values of their two - unknown cards, and our total is relatively low, it is beneficial for us to try to get closer to 24.\n2. Consider the possible outcomes of hitting:\n   - The worst - case scenario of hitting is that we get a high - value card and exceed 24. But the probability of getting a card that makes us exceed 24 immediately is relatively low. For example, if we get a face - card (J, Q, K), we will exceed 24, but there are also many low - value cards (2 - 10, A) that can help us get closer to 24.\n   - Standing at a total of 10 is very likely to result in a loss because the opponent may get a total closer to 24.\n\nSo, the better move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Let's analyze the situation. The threshold \\(N = 24\\). Our current total is 15. The opponent has a face - up 9 and two unknown cards and has already decided to stand in the last turn.\n\nThe opponent's minimum possible total is 9 (if the two unknown cards are Aces, \\(9+1 + 1=11\\)). The maximum possible total is \\(9+13+13 = 35\\) (if the two unknown cards are Kings).\n\nIf we stand now, our total is 15. We need to consider the range of the opponent's total. The opponent may have a total less than 15, between 15 and 24, or greater than 24.\n\nIf we hit, there is a risk of going over 24. But if we stand with 15,  the opponent has a good chance of getting a total closer to 24 than us.\n\nLet's calculate the probability of going over 24 if we hit. The cards in the deck range from 1 (Ace) to 13 (King).\nIf we draw a card \\(x\\), we will go over 24 when \\(15 + x>24\\), i.e., \\(x > 9\\). There are \\(13 - 9=4\\) cards (10, J, Q, K) out of 13 that will make us go over 24. So the probability of going over 24 if we hit is \\(\\frac{4}{13}\\approx0.308\\)\n\nIf we don't hit, the opponent has a relatively high chance of getting a total between 15 and 24. Since the opponent stood in the last turn, it is likely that their total is close to 24.\n\nSo, it is a good strategy to hit in order to try to get closer to 24.\n\nAnswer: Hit","First, let's analyze the situation. The current threshold \\(N = 24\\). Our total is 20. The opponent has a face - up 9 and two unknown cards. Since the opponent has already stood, we can assume that they think their total is close enough to 24 or they are afraid of exceeding it.\n\nIf we hit, there is a risk of exceeding 24. The possible cards we can draw range from 1 (Ace) to 13 (King). \n- If we draw a card with a value of 1 - 4, our total will be 21 - 24, which is a good position as we are close to 24. \n- If we draw a card with a value of 5 - 13, we will exceed 24 and lose if the opponent does not exceed 24.\n\nLooking at the opponent's situation, they stood after the first turn. This might indicate that their total is already close to 24. Since we are already at 20, standing seems to be a more conservative and reasonable choice. Standing will ensure that we don't exceed 24 by taking an unnecessary risk.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis:\n1. Currently, our total score is 10 and the threshold N is 42. There is a large gap between our current score and the threshold, so taking another card (Hit) has a high probability of helping us get closer to the threshold without exceeding it.\n2. Looking at the opponent's face - up card, we only know one card with a value of 5, and the other is unknown. Based on the history of previous rounds, we don't have enough information to predict exactly what the opponent will do or their final score, but we can try to optimize our own score by hitting.\n3. Since we are far from the threshold, hitting is a reasonable choice as it gives us a chance to get a better score.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. Currently, our total score is 23 and the threshold N is 42. There is still a large gap between our current score and the threshold, so taking an additional card (Hit) has a relatively low risk of exceeding the threshold.\n2. Looking at the opponent's cards, we only know one of them is 5, and we have no information about the other two. But considering the history, the opponent seems to be quite active in taking cards.\n3. To get closer to the threshold N to increase the chance of winning, it is advisable for us to take another card at this time.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Looking at the history, we can observe that our opponent seems to be quite aggressive in taking hits. Currently, our total is 26 and the threshold N is 42, so we still have a good margin to get closer to 42. Since we have access to the complete history and can see that often getting more cards helps us get a better total without exceeding the threshold, and considering our current relatively low total, it is beneficial for us to take another card (Hit).\nAnswer: Hit","1. Analyze the situation:\n   - Currently, your total score is 31, and the threshold \\(N = 42\\). You still have some room to get closer to 42 without exceeding it.\n   - Looking at the opponent's strategy from the history, in most rounds, the opponent continues to hit until a relatively late stage. Since it's turn 4 and the opponent has continued to hit so far, it's likely that the opponent will also try to get a higher - scoring hand.\n   - If you stand now, your score is 31. The opponent may be able to get a score closer to 42. By hitting, you have a chance to increase your score and get closer to 42, which may increase your chances of winning.\n2. Decision:\n   - It is advisable to hit in this situation to try to get a better score.\n\nAnswer: Hit","First, let's analyze the situation. The current threshold \\(N = 42\\), and our total is \\(36\\). There is a chance to get closer to \\(42\\) by hitting.\n\nLooking at the opponent's visible card, they have a \\(5\\). Since we don't know their other cards, it's hard to accurately predict their total. However, our total of \\(36\\) is relatively far from \\(42\\), and we can try to get closer without a high - risk of immediately exceeding \\(42\\).\n\nIf we hit, the possible values of the new card range from \\(1\\) (Ace) to \\(13\\) (King). If we get a card with a value of \\(1 - 6\\), we will get closer to \\(42\\) without exceeding it. The probability of getting a card in this range is relatively high considering the card values in the deck.\n\nSo, it is a good idea to take the risk and try to get closer to \\(42\\) by hitting.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n- Our current total is 38 and the threshold N is 42. The difference between our total and the threshold is \\(42 - 38=4\\).\n- The opponent has one known card worth 5 and 5 unknown cards. The opponent chose to stand in the last turn.\n- If we hit, there is a risk of exceeding 42. The highest - value non - exceeding card we can get is 4. If we get a card with a value of 5 or more, we will exceed 42.\n- Since the opponent has already stopped, it is very likely that their total is close to 42. If we stand, we have a good chance of winning as long as the opponent's total does not exceed ours.\nSo, the better move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Let's analyze the situation. Our current total is 13 and the threshold N is 37. We have a significant gap to reach a competitive score.\n\nLooking at the opponent's face - up card, they have a 'K' (worth 13 points). Even if their face - down card is an Ace (worth 1 point), their minimum total is 14.\n\nSince we are far from the threshold and there is a good chance to get a card that will bring us closer to 37 without exceeding it, it is a good idea to take a hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n- Our current total is 25, and the threshold \\(N = 37\\). We are quite far from the threshold, and there is a good chance that taking another card won't make us exceed 37.\n- Looking at the opponent's cards, they have a 'K' (worth 13 points) already. Even without knowing the values of the two unknown - cards, they may have a relatively high total. To get closer to 37 and increase our chances of winning, we should take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Since my current total is already 37, which is equal to the threshold (N = 37). If I take another card (Hit), I will definitely exceed 37 and lose if the opponent does not exceed 37. So, I should stop drawing cards and choose to Stand.\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

First, look at the opponent's strategy based on the history:\n   - In all previous rounds, the opponent always hits at least as many times as the player in the early - stage turns.\n   - In Round 2, when the player stopped at Turn 5, the opponent continued to hit one more time. This shows that the opponent is quite aggressive in taking cards.\n2. Analyze the current situation:\n   - The current threshold \\(N = 47\\), and our current total is 25. There is still a large gap from the threshold.\n   - Since the opponent is aggressive in taking cards, we have a relatively safe margin to take more cards to get closer to 47.

For example, if we get a card with a value of 5 or more, we will exceed the threshold. But if we stand, and the opponent keeps hitting and does not exceed 28 and gets closer to 28 than our 24, we will lose.\n   - However, considering the current small difference from the threshold, the risk of hitting and going over is relatively high. So, it is more prudent to stand at this point.\n2. **Answer in the required format**:\nAnswer: Stand","Looking at the history, we can try to analyze the opponent's strategy. In most previous rounds, the opponent kept hitting until they either exceeded the threshold or stopped at a relatively high - value hand.\n\nIn the current round, the threshold \\(N = 28\\) and our total is \\(24\\). We are close to the threshold but still have some room to gain points without exceeding it.\n\nThe opponent has hit in both previous turns and still has unknown cards. It's very likely that they are trying to get a hand value close to or above ours.\n\nIf we stand, we have a total of \\(24\\). The opponent may keep hitting and potentially get a hand value between \\(25\\) and \\(28\\) to beat us.\n\nIf we hit, there is a chance that we can get a card to increase our total closer to \\(28\\) without exceeding it. For example, getting a \\(2\\), \\(3\\), or \\(4\\) would be beneficial.\n\nSo, the better move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Looking at the history, we can observe that the opponent often continues to hit multiple times in a round. Currently, our total is 11 and the threshold N is 30. We are quite far from the threshold, so it is beneficial for us to get closer to the threshold by hitting.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Looking at the history, the opponent seems to be quite aggressive in taking hits. Currently, our total is 18 and the threshold N is 30. We have a good margin to get closer to 30 without exceeding it easily. Taking another hit gives us a chance to increase our score and get closer to 30, which will put us in a better position to win the round.\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the history, the opponent often continues to draw cards. Currently, our total is 21 and the threshold is 39. There is a relatively large gap between our current total and the threshold, so it is beneficial for us to draw a card to get closer to the threshold.\nAnswer: Hit","1. **Analysis of the situation**:\n   - The current threshold \\(N = 39\\). My total score is 34 with cards \\(['Q', '9', 'K']\\).\n   - The opponent has a face - up \\(Q\\) (worth 12 points) and two unknown cards.\n   - Looking at the history, we can see that the opponent generally tends to take multiple hits.\n   - If I take a hit, there is a risk of exceeding 39. But if I stand, the opponent may keep hitting and get a score closer to 39 or exceed it. Since the opponent has a high - tendency to hit based on the history, and my current score of 34 is relatively close to 39, it is a reasonable strategy to stand and let the opponent take more risks.\n2. **Answer in the required format**:\nAnswer: Stand","First, let's analyze the situation. Our current total is 34, and the threshold \\(N = 39\\). The opponent has a \\(Q\\) (worth 12 points) and three unknown cards.\n\nLooking at the opponent's past behavior, they seem to be quite aggressive in taking hits. Since they have already taken two hits in this round and still decided to hit on the second turn even when we have already stood, it's likely that they will continue to try to get closer to 39.\n\nIf we take a hit, there is a risk of going over 39. For example, if we draw a 6 or higher (a 6 - 13 value card), we will exceed 39. The probability of drawing a card that will make us go over 39 is \\(\\frac{8}{13}\\) (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K).\n\nOn the other hand, our current total of 34 is relatively close to 39. The opponent may over - shoot 39 while trying to get a higher total. So, it's a better strategy to stand and let the opponent take the risk of going over the threshold.\n\nAnswer: Stand","First, let's analyze the situation. Our current total is 34 and the threshold \\(N = 39\\). We are already quite close to the threshold.\n\nLooking at the opponent's cards, they have a Queen (worth 12 points) and 4 unknown cards. We don't know exactly what their total is, but they have been hitting in each turn so far.\n\nIf we hit, there is a significant risk of exceeding the threshold of 39. Since we are already at 34, even a card as low as a 6 would make us go over.\n\nOn the other hand, if we stand, we are in a relatively good position. The opponent might go over the threshold while trying to get closer to 39, or their total might end up being less than our 34.\n\nBased on this analysis, it is better for us to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the history, the opponent seems to be quite aggressive in taking cards. My current total is 16 and the threshold is 37, there is a large gap. So I should take another card to get closer to the threshold.\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n- Our current total is 17, and the threshold N is 37. There is still a large gap between our current total and the threshold, so taking another card (Hit) has a relatively low risk of exceeding the threshold.\n- Looking at the opponent's situation, we only know one of their cards is a '5', and the other two are unknown. From the historical records, the opponent tends to keep hitting. So we need to increase our total to have a better chance of winning.\n\nDecision: Hit\nAnswer: Hit","1. Analyze the situation:\n   - Currently, our total is 21 and the threshold \\(N = 37\\). We still have a relatively large gap from the threshold, so there is room to take an additional card.\n   - Looking at the opponent's strategy from the history, they often continue to hit even when there are multiple turns. Also, we don't know their total yet, but it's likely they are also trying to get closer to the threshold.\n   - The risk of hitting at this point is relatively low as we are far from exceeding the threshold. If we stand now, the opponent may get closer to the threshold and win. So, it's better to hit to increase our chances of getting a better total.\n2. Output in the required format:\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis: Currently, our total score is 23 and the threshold N is 37. There is still a relatively large gap between our score and the threshold, so it is beneficial for us to draw another card to get closer to the threshold.

By hitting, we have a chance to increase our score and get closer to 37 without a high risk of immediately exceeding it.\n\nAnswer: Hit","1. Analyze the current situation:\n   - The current total of my cards is 26, and the threshold \\(N = 37\\). There is still a relatively large gap (\\(37 - 26=11\\)) between my current total and the threshold.\n   - Looking at the opponent's behavior, the opponent stood in the 4th turn. This might indicate that the opponent either has a total close to 37 and doesn't want to risk exceeding it or has already exceeded 37.\n   - By looking at the history, in most cases where the opponent stands early, they are likely to have a relatively good - scoring hand close to the threshold. To have a better chance of winning, I should try to get closer to 37.\n   - Since there is a significant margin before reaching 37, hitting is a reasonable choice to increase my total and get closer to the threshold.\n2. Format the answer:\nAnswer: Hit","Looking at the history, the opponent seems to be quite aggressive in taking cards.

First, understand the current situation:\n   - The current threshold \\(N = 39\\).\n   - Your current card total is 31.\n   - The opponent has already stood, and we don't know the total of the opponent's cards. But since the opponent has stopped taking cards, they may have a relatively good - formed hand.\n2. Consider the risks and benefits of hitting and standing:\n   - If you stand with a total of 31, you are relatively far from the threshold of 39. There is a possibility that the opponent's total is closer to 39 and wins.\n   - If you hit, there is a risk of exceeding 39. However, since you are 8 points away from the threshold, there is a chance to get a card that can get you closer to 39 without exceeding it. For example, if you get a 2 - 8 point card, your situation will improve. The probability of getting a card that will not make you exceed 39 is relatively high considering the range of card values.\n\nSo, the better move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\nThe current total of your cards is 35, and the threshold N is 39. If you hit, there is a risk of exceeding 39. The opponent has already stood, and we don't know the total of their cards. But since your current total is relatively close to 39, standing at this moment is a relatively safe option. If you hit and go over 39, you will lose if the opponent's total is within 39. If you stand, you have a chance to win if the opponent's total is less than 35 or lose if the opponent's total is between 35 and 39. \n\nAnswer: Stand\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis:\n- Currently, the total of my cards is only 2, which is far from the threshold N = 43.\n- Looking at the opponent's known card '3', we don't know the value of the face - down card. But our current total is so low that we have a lot of room to draw cards without exceeding the threshold.\n- From the history, we can see that the opponent tends to draw multiple cards in the early rounds. So, we should also try to increase our total to get closer to the threshold.\n- Drawing an additional card (Hit) is a reasonable choice as it gives us a chance to get a better total and potentially win the round.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Let's analyze the situation. Currently, my total score is 15 with a threshold (N) of 43, which means I am quite far from the threshold and have a lot of room to draw more cards. \n\nLooking at the opponent's face - up card which is 3, and considering the opponent's past behavior, in both previous rounds, the opponent kept hitting multiple times. So, it's very likely that the opponent will continue to hit to increase their score. \n\nIf I stand now, my score of 15 is much lower than the threshold, and the opponent has a good chance of getting closer to 43 than me by hitting more cards. \n\nBy hitting another card, I have a high probability of getting a card that will increase my score significantly without exceeding 43. For example, even if I get a face - card (maximum value of 13), my total will be 15 + 13=28, still far from 43.\n\nSo, I should Hit.\nAnswer: Hit","1. **Analysis based on history and current situation**:\n   - In the previous two rounds, when we kept hitting cards, we were able to get a total close to the threshold \\(N\\) while the opponent exceeded the threshold.\n   - Currently, our total is 21 and the threshold \\(N = 43\\). We still have a lot of room to increase our score. Since our opponent has been hitting cards in the previous turns, it is likely that they are also trying to get a high - scoring hand.\n   - If we stand now, our score of 21 is quite far from the threshold. By hitting, we have a good chance of getting closer to 43 without exceeding it.\n2. **Decision**:\n   - Based on the above analysis, the better move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, understand the current situation:\n   - The threshold \\(N = 43\\). Our current card total is 23.\n   - Looking at the opponent's strategy from the previous rounds, in Round 1, the opponent hit until the second - turn and then stood. In Round 2, the opponent hit until the fourth - turn and then stood. In the current round, the opponent has hit for 3 turns so far.\n   - Since our current total is 23, which is far from the threshold of 43, we have a lot of room to increase our score.\n2. Consider the possible outcomes of hitting:\n   - The lowest - value card is an Ace (1 point), and the highest - value card is a King (13 points). Even if we get a high - value card, there is a very low risk of exceeding 43. For example, if we get a King (13 points), our total will be \\(23 + 13=36\\), which is still less than 43.\n3. Conclusion:\n   - It is beneficial for us to hit to get closer to the threshold of 43.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, consider the current situation. The threshold \\(N = 43\\), and our current total card - value is 27. There is still a relatively large gap between our total and the threshold, so we have room to take another card.\n2. Looking at the opponent's strategy from the history:\n    - In Round 1, the opponent kept hitting until they went over the threshold.\n    - In Round 2, the opponent also kept hitting until they went over the threshold.\n    - In the current round, the opponent has been hitting in each turn so far. It is very likely that the opponent will continue to hit and may go over the threshold.\n3. By taking another card (hitting), we have a chance to get closer to the threshold of 43 without a high risk of going over it immediately, because the difference between our current total (27) and 43 is 16.\n\nBased on the above analysis, it is a good move to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","1. **Analysis of the current situation**:\n   - The current total of your cards is 37, and the threshold \\(N = 43\\). There is a gap of \\(43 - 37=6\\) points between your current total and the threshold.\n   - Looking at the opponent's strategy from the previous rounds, in both Round 1 and Round 2, the opponent kept hitting until they busted. In Round 1, the opponent's total was 32 when the threshold was 26, and in Round 2, the opponent's total was 46 when the threshold was 39.\n   - Since the opponent has a tendency to keep hitting and may end up exceeding the threshold of 43, and hitting a card with a value of 7 or more will make you exceed the threshold of 43, it is a safer option to stand at this point.\n2. **Output in the required format**:\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis:\n1. In the previous 3 rounds, the opponent always chose to \"hit\" in the early turns. We can assume that the opponent has a relatively aggressive strategy of taking more cards at the beginning.\n2. Our current total score is 11, and the threshold \\(N = 49\\). There is a large gap between our current total and the threshold. Taking another card has a relatively low risk of exceeding the threshold.\n3. To get closer to the threshold \\(N = 49\\) and increase our chances of winning based on the opponent's previous strategy, we should take an additional card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","1. Analyze the situation:\n   - We know our current total is 19 and the threshold \\(N = 49\\). There is still a large gap between our current total and the threshold.\n   - Looking at the opponent's strategy in the previous rounds, in all previous rounds, the opponent kept hitting until at least turn 2. So, it is likely that the opponent will continue to hit to increase their total.\n   - Given that we have a lot of room to increase our total without exceeding \\(N\\), it is beneficial for us to take another card (hit) to get closer to \\(N\\).\n2.

For example, if I get a card with a value of 6 or more, I will exceed 28. \nThe opponent has an 'A' (value 1) and two unknown cards. We don't know their total. But my current total of 23 is relatively close to 28. Standing gives me a chance to see if the opponent exceeds 28 or if their total is less than mine.\nSo, I should choose to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis: Currently, my total score is 13 and the threshold N is 28. The opponent has a 'J' (worth 11 points) and an unknown card. Since my current score is relatively far from the threshold of 28, taking an additional card (Hit) has a high probability of not exceeding 28 and getting closer to 28 to increase the chance of winning.\n\nBased on the opponent's performance in the previous round, they tend to take an additional card in the first turn. Considering the situation comprehensively, I should also take an additional card to enhance my competitiveness.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Since my current total is 17 and the threshold N is 28, I am quite far from the threshold. There is a good chance of getting a card that won't make me exceed 28 and will bring me closer to the threshold to potentially win.

So, the better move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. In the previous two rounds, when the threshold was 28, we could observe some behaviors of the opponent. In round 1, the opponent continued to hit until the total reached 25. In round 2, the opponent stopped hitting when the total was 25. It seems that the opponent might stop hitting around a total close to 25.\n2. Currently, our total is 9, and the threshold is 29. We have a lot of room to increase our total without exceeding the threshold.\n3. Since we are far from the threshold, it is a good idea to take another card to get closer to the threshold and potentially win the round.\n\nSo, the decision should be to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. Currently, my total score is 10, and the threshold N = 29. There is a large gap between my current score and the threshold, so hitting is a reasonable option as there is a low risk of exceeding the threshold.\n2. Looking at the opponent's situation, they have a 9 and two unknown - cards. They stood in the last turn, which might indicate that they are close to the threshold or worried about exceeding it.\n3. Based on the history, in Round 1 and Round 2, hitting has helped me get closer to the threshold and in Round 2, it led to a win. So, hitting is a good strategy to try to get a higher score closer to 29.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Let's analyze the situation. The current threshold \\(N = 29\\), and our total score with the cards ['5', '3', 'A', 'A', '8'] is 18.\n\nLooking at the opponent's visible card '9', and considering that they have stopped hitting in turn 2 and 3, we can assume that they might have a relatively high - value hand close to 29. \n\nIf we hit, there is a chance that we can get closer to 29. The possible cards we can draw range from 1 (Ace) to 13 (King). If we draw a low - value card (e.g., an Ace, 2, 3), we will still be far from exceeding 29 and get closer to it. Even if we draw a high - value card, we have a buffer of \\(29 - 18=11\\) points before we exceed the limit.\n\nIf we stand now, with a total of 18, it is quite likely that the opponent who stopped hitting earlier has a higher score closer to 29. So, hitting gives us a better chance to win this round.\n\nAnswer: Hit","1. **Analysis**:\n   - Currently, your total score is 20 and the threshold \\(N = 29\\). There is a gap of \\(29 - 20=9\\) points between your current score and the threshold.\n   - Looking at the opponent's known card, they have a 9. The opponent has already stopped drawing cards. Since the opponent has two unknown - cards, their maximum possible score is \\(9 + 13+13 = 35\\) (assuming the two unknown cards are both Ks), and the minimum possible score is \\(9 + 1+1 = 11\\) (assuming the two unknown cards are both Aces).\n   - If you draw a card, the worst - case scenario is that you get a face - card (e.g., a K worth 13 points). In that case, your total would be \\(20 + 13=33\\), which exceeds the threshold. But if you don't draw a card, there is a high chance that the opponent, with two unknown cards, can get closer to 29 than you.\n   - The probability of getting a card that will not make you exceed 29 is relatively high. For example, if you get a card from 2 - 9, your total will still be within the limit. The probability of getting a card in the range of 2 - 9 from an infinite deck is \\(\\frac{8}{13}\\).\n   - So, it is beneficial for you to draw one more card to try to get closer to 29.\n2. **Output in the required format**:\nAnswer: Hit","Looking at the history, when the threshold (N) was around 28 - 29, the opponent seemed to stop hitting earlier. Our current total is 12 which is quite far from the threshold of 29. To get closer to the threshold and potentially win, we should request an additional card.\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, understand the current situation:\n   - The current threshold \\(N = 29\\).\n   - Our total score is 20 with cards ['8', '4', '8'].\n   - The opponent has a face - up 'Q' (worth 12 points) and two unknown cards.\n2. Analyze the opponent's situation:\n   - In the previous three rounds, we can observe the opponent's behavior. In Round 1, the opponent hit in the first turn and then stood. In Round 2, the opponent hit in the first turn and then stood. In Round 3, the opponent hit in the first turn and then stood for multiple turns. It seems that the opponent has a relatively conservative strategy of hitting once and then standing.\n   - With a 'Q' (12 points) already face - up, even if the opponent's other two cards are the lowest - value aces (1 point each), the opponent's minimum total is \\(12 + 1+1=14\\). If the opponent gets some larger - value cards, they may get close to or exceed 29.\n3. Analyze our own situation:\n   - Our current total is 20. If we hit, there is a chance to get closer to 29 without exceeding it. For example, if we get a card with a value of 1 - 9, our total will be within the limit.\n   - If we stand, we have a relatively low total of 20. Given the opponent's behavior and the possibility of them getting a higher total, we are more likely to lose.\n\nSo, the better move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Looking at the history, the opponent seems to stand relatively early. In the current situation, our total is only 9 and the threshold is 41. We are far from the threshold, so it is very likely that taking another card (Hit) will not cause us to exceed the threshold and can increase our total to get closer to 41.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. The current total of my cards is 20, and the threshold \\(N = 41\\). There is still a large gap between 20 and 41.\n2. Looking at the opponent's known card, only a '5' is visible. We have no clear information about the opponent's total score, but considering the previous rounds and the fact that we are far from the threshold, taking another card (hitting) has a high probability of not exceeding the threshold and can increase our score to get closer to 41.\n3. From the history, in some rounds where we stopped hitting earlier, we lost. For example, in Round 1, our total was 23 and the opponent's was 25, and we lost. So we should try to increase our score when we are far from the threshold.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the best move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n- Currently, our total score is 33 and the threshold \\(N = 41\\). There is a gap of \\(41 - 33=8\\) points between our current score and the threshold.\n- Looking at the opponent's situation, we only know one of their cards is a '5'. Since we have no clear information about the opponent's total score, and considering our current score is relatively far from the threshold, there is a high probability that hitting a card will not cause us to exceed the threshold. We can try to get closer to the threshold by hitting a card to increase our chance of winning.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Since your total score is already 42 which exceeds the threshold of 41, no matter what the opponent's final score is, if the opponent does not exceed 41, you will lose; if the opponent also exceeds 41, it will be a draw.

Analyze the situation:\n   - The current total of our cards is 29, and the threshold \\(N = 48\\). There is still a relatively large gap between our current total and the threshold.\n   - Looking at the opponent's fixed - strategy from previous rounds, the opponent usually continues to hit for multiple turns. In previous rounds, when the opponent started hitting, they often continued to take cards until they either exceeded the threshold or were close to it.\n   - We have a good chance of getting closer to the threshold without exceeding it by taking another card. Since we are far from the threshold, hitting gives us an opportunity to increase our score and potentially get closer to 48 than the opponent.\n2. Determine the move:\n   - Based on the above analysis, the best move for this turn is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","First, let's analyze the situation. Our current total is 38 with a threshold of 48, so we have a margin of 48 - 38 = 10 points before we exceed the threshold.\n\nLooking at the opponent's situation, we only know one of their cards which is 7. Since we don't know the values of their other 4 unknown cards, they could potentially have a high - scoring hand already or still be far from the threshold.\n\nHowever, considering our relatively safe position (a margin of 10 points), it is a good idea to take a risk and hit to try to get closer to the threshold. If we get a card with a value of 1 - 10, we won't exceed the threshold and may get closer to 48.\n\nAnswer: Hit","1. **Analysis**:\n   - Your current total is 43, and the threshold \\(N = 48\\). There is a difference of \\(48 - 43=5\\) between your current total and the threshold.\n   - Looking at the opponent's situation, they have one known card of value 7, and 5 unknown cards. It's very likely that the opponent may still try to get closer to 48.\n   - If you take another card (Hit), there is a risk of exceeding 48. But considering that your current total is still some distance from 48, and the opponent might get a high - total with their unknown cards, it's worth taking a small risk to try to get closer to 48.\n2. **Decision**:\n   - Based on the above analysis, the better move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Currently, your total card value is 46, which is very close to the threshold of 48. If you choose to hit, there is a high probability that the value of the new - drawn card will cause your total to exceed 48.\nThe opponent has one known card with a value of 7. We don't know the values of the other five cards, but since they stood on the previous turn, it is possible that they also have a relatively high - value total close to 48.\nTo avoid exceeding 48, it is wiser to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","1. Analyze the situation:\n   - Currently, my total score is 20 and the threshold \\(N = 27\\). There is still a relatively large gap (\\(27 - 20=7\\)) between my current total and the threshold.\n   - Looking at the opponent's face - up card, they have a 'K' (worth 13 points). We don't know the value of their face - down card, but they could potentially have a high - value total.\n   - From the history, in rounds where the threshold was around 28 - 29, I often lost when I exceeded the threshold after multiple hits. However, in this case, since my current total is far from the threshold, taking one more card has a relatively low risk of exceeding 27.\n   - The possible values of the next card range from 1 (Ace) to 13 (K). The probability of getting a card that will make me exceed 27 is relatively low. For example, if I get an Ace (1 point), my total will be \\(20 + 1=21\\); if I get a 2, my total will be \\(20+2 = 22\\); if I get a 3, my total will be \\(20 + 3=23\\); if I get a 4, my total will be \\(20+4 = 24\\); if I get a 5, my total will be \\(20+5 = 25\\); if I get a 6, my total will be \\(20+6 = 26\\); if I get a 7, my total will be \\(20 + 7=27\\). Only if I get a card with a value of 8 or higher will I exceed 27.\n2. Decision:\n   - Based on the above analysis, it is reasonable to take one more card (Hit) to increase my chances of getting closer to the threshold.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Let's analyze the situation. Currently, our total is 23 and the threshold \\(N = 27\\). The difference between our total and the threshold is \\(27 - 23=4\\).\n\nLooking at the opponent's visible card, they have a 'K' (worth 13 points).

The possible values of the new - drawn card range from 1 (Ace) to 13 (King). If we draw a card with a value of 5 or more, we will exceed 27.\n\nIf we stand, we have a total of 23. The opponent may exceed 27 with their aggressive strategy. Since our total is already relatively close to 27, standing gives us a good chance of winning as long as the opponent either exceeds 27 or gets a total less than 23.\n\nSo, the better move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the history, when the threshold is relatively high (like 41 and 48), it was beneficial to keep hitting to get closer to the threshold.

Drawing another card can potentially increase our total to be closer to 46 and increase our chances of winning. So, the better move is to Hit.\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n- Currently, our total score is 33, and the threshold \\(N = 46\\). There is still a relatively large gap between our current score and the threshold.\n- Looking at the opponent's actions, the opponent has chosen to stand in the 6th turn. This might indicate that the opponent's score is close to the threshold or they are worried about exceeding it.\n- Since our score is far from the threshold, we can try to get closer to the threshold by taking one more card. If we don't exceed 46 after getting a new card, we will have a better chance of winning.\n\nDecision: Hit\n\nAnswer: Hit","First, let's analyze the current situation. Our total is 41 and the threshold N is 46. We are 5 points away from the threshold.\n\nLooking at the opponent's situation, they have a 5 and 6 unknown cards, and they have already decided to stand. \n\nIf we take another card (Hit), there is a risk of exceeding 46. The possible values of the next - card range from 1 (Ace) to 13 (King). If we get a card with a value of 6 or more, we will exceed 46. \n\nSince our current total of 41 is already relatively close to 46 and the opponent has chosen to stand, standing gives us a good chance of winning as long as the opponent's total does not exceed 46 and is less than 41.\n\nSo, the better move is to Stand.\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

In this round, the opponent has already taken one hit.\n   - Our current total is 22, and the threshold \\(N = 38\\). We still have some room to take more cards without exceeding the threshold.\n   - Since the opponent seems to have a tendency to keep hitting, there is a high chance that they will either exceed the threshold or get close to it. If we stand now, with a total of 22, there is a risk that the opponent may get a better - scoring hand. So, it is beneficial for us to take another card to get closer to the threshold.\n2. **Answer in the required format**:\nAnswer: Hit","1. **Analysis of the situation**:\n   - The current threshold \\(N = 38\\). Your current total is \\(29\\).\n   - From the previous round, we can see that the opponent seems to be quite aggressive in taking cards. In the previous round with \\(N = 48\\), the opponent kept hitting until the 7 - th turn.\n   - If you hit, there is a chance to get closer to \\(N = 38\\) without exceeding it. For example, if you get a 2 - 9 card, your total will be within the limit and closer to 38. The probability of getting a card that will make you exceed 38 (a 10, J, Q, K) is relatively low.\n   - Since the opponent has an aggressive strategy (as shown in the previous round), it is likely that they will also try to get a high - value hand. So, you should try to get closer to 38 to have a better chance of winning.\n2. **Decision**:\n   - Based on the above analysis, the better move is to Hit.\n\nOutput in the required format:\nI recommend hitting in this turn.\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis: Since your current total card value is 39, which already exceeds the threshold N = 38, no matter what the opponent does, as long as the opponent doesn't exceed 38, the opponent will win. So there is no need to take more cards. The best move is to stand.\nAnswer: Stand","Since your total score is already 39 which exceeds the threshold N = 38, if the opponent does not exceed 38, you will lose. However, if the opponent also exceeds 38, it will be a draw. Given that the opponent is still hitting, there is a good chance they might exceed 38 as well. So, even though you've already exceeded 38, there's a possibility of getting a draw. In this situation, there's no benefit in taking another card as your score is already over the limit. So, the best move is to stand.\nAnswer: Stand","1. Analyze the situation:\n   - Currently, our total card value is 10, and the threshold \\(N = 34\\). There is still a large gap between our current total and the threshold.\n   - Looking at the opponent's previous strategies, in Round 1, the opponent kept hitting until the 7 - th turn and then stood, and in Round 2, the opponent continued to hit even after we had stood. This shows that the opponent has a relatively aggressive strategy of hitting for more cards.\n   - Given that our current total is far from the threshold, hitting a card has a high probability of getting us closer to the threshold without exceeding it. For example, even if we get a face - card (the maximum value is 13), \\(10 + 13=23\\) which is still less than 34.\n2.

So I should choose to Stand.\nAnswer: Stand","Looking at the opponent's strategy from the previous rounds, they tend to take multiple hits.

Analyze the opponent's strategy based on history:\n   - In Round 1, the opponent hit until Turn 7 and then stood. The opponent's final total was 50 when the threshold \\(N = 48\\).\n   - In Round 2, the opponent kept hitting even after the player stood. The opponent's final total was 45 when the threshold \\(N = 38\\).\n   - In Round 3, the opponent hit for 2 turns and then stood. The opponent's final total was 12 when the threshold \\(N = 34\\).\n   - The opponent seems to be more inclined to keep hitting to increase the total.\n2. Analyze the current situation:\n   - Our current total is 21, and the threshold \\(N = 36\\). There is still room to increase our total to get closer to 36.\n   - Since the opponent has a tendency to keep hitting, it is likely that the opponent will continue to increase their total.

Analyze the situation:\n   - First, look at the opponent's strategy based on the history. In previous rounds, the opponent generally continues to hit multiple times before standing. For example, in Round 1, the opponent hit 6 times before standing; in Round 2, the opponent hit 5 times; in Round 3, the opponent hit 2 times.\n   - Currently, your total score is 27 with a threshold \\(N = 36\\). There is still a relatively large gap between your current score and the threshold, and it is relatively safe to take another card.\n   - If you take another card, there is a good chance to get closer to the threshold of 36 without exceeding it, increasing your chances of winning.\n2. Make a decision:\n   - Based on the above analysis, the better move is to \"Hit\".\n\nAnswer: Hit","Looking at the history, we can try to analyze the opponent's strategy. In Round 1, the opponent stood when the total was around 50 and the threshold was 48. In Round 2, the opponent kept hitting even though the total was already high (45) when the threshold was 38. In Round 3, the opponent stopped early with a total of 12 when the threshold was 34.\n\nOur current total is 29 and the threshold is 36. We are relatively close to the threshold. The opponent has only one known card (2) and has been hitting so far.\n\nIf we hit, there is a risk of going over 36. For example, if we get a 10 - point card (a 10, J, Q, or K), we will go over.\n\nBased on the opponent's inconsistent behavior in previous rounds, it's hard to predict exactly what they will end up with. But considering our current position, standing seems to be a safer option as we are already close to the threshold without exceeding it.\n\nAnswer: Stand","1. Analyze the situation:\n   - Currently, my total is 21 with a threshold \\(N = 35\\). There is a difference of \\(35 - 21=14\\) between my current total and the threshold.\n   - Looking at the opponent's strategy from previous rounds, the opponent usually keeps hitting. For example, in Round 1, the opponent hit until Turn 7; in Round 2, the opponent hit until the end; in Round 3, the opponent hit for 2 turns; in Round 4, the opponent hit for 4 turns.\n   - Since my current total is relatively far from the threshold, and the opponent has a tendency to keep hitting, I should also try to get closer to the threshold. So, I should choose to hit.\n2. Output in the required format:\nAnswer: Hit","Let's analyze the situation based on the history and the current state of the game.\n\n### Analyzing the opponent's strategy from history\n- In Round 1, the opponent stood after 7 turns while we took 8 turns. The opponent's total was 50 and ours was 45 with a threshold of 48.\n- In Round 2, the opponent continued hitting even after we stood.

There is a difference of \\(35 - 28=7\\) between our current total and the threshold.\n\nIf we take another card, there is a risk of exceeding 35. However, considering the opponent's aggressive strategy, they are likely to get close to or exceed the threshold. By hitting, we have a chance to get closer to 35 and potentially win.\n\nLet's assume the probability of getting a card that will not make us exceed 35:\n- The cards that will not make us exceed 35 are cards with values from 1 to 7.\n- Since we are drawing from an infinite deck, the probability of getting a card with value 1 - 7 is \\(\\frac{7}{13}\\approx0.54\\)\n\nIf we stand, the opponent may hit and get a better hand than us if they don't exceed 35.\n\nBased on the opponent's strategy and the potential gain of getting closer to the threshold, it is better for us to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Since my total score of 39 has already exceeded the threshold of 35, hitting another card won't change the fact that I've exceeded the limit.

Analyze the situation:\n   - The current threshold \\(N = 41\\). Your current total is 31.\n   - Looking at the opponent's strategy from the history, the opponent usually keeps hitting.\n   - Since your current total is 31 and is quite far from the threshold of 41, taking another card (hitting) has a relatively low risk of exceeding 41. And if you get a card with a suitable value, it can bring you closer to 41.\n2. Decision:\n   - It is advisable to take another card, so the answer is \"Hit\".\n\nAnswer: Hit","1. **Analysis of the situation**:\n   - My current total score is 40, and the threshold \\(N = 41\\). If I hit, there is a high risk of exceeding 41. For example, if I get any card other than an Ace (which is worth 1 point), my total will exceed 41.\n   - Looking at the opponent's cards, they have a 4 and three unknown cards. Their strategy in previous rounds shows that they tend to keep hitting.\n   - Since my current total is very close to 41 (only 1 point away), it is a very risky move to hit. Standing gives me a good chance. If the opponent exceeds 41 while I don't, I win. If neither of us exceeds 41, my total of 40 is already quite close to 41, and there is a high - probability that I will win or at least draw.\n2. **Decision**:\n   - Based on the above analysis, I should stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the history, the opponent seems to keep hitting until a relatively high - value hand is formed. Since our current total is 5 and the threshold is 26, we are far from the threshold. We should take a risk and try to get closer to 26. So, the best move is to hit.\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, understand the opponent's general strategy from the history. In most rounds, the opponent keeps hitting until a certain point.\n2. Calculate the remaining distance to the threshold \\(N = 26\\) for us. Our current total is 14, so we have \\(26 - 14=12\\) points of room to increase our score without exceeding the threshold.\n3. The risk of hitting is relatively low at this moment. If we hit and get a card with a value of 12 or less, we will not exceed the threshold. And by hitting, we have a chance to get closer to the threshold of 26 and increase our winning probability.\n4. Considering the opponent's past behavior of often hitting multiple times, it is likely that the opponent will continue to try to get closer to the threshold, so we also need to strengthen our hand.\n\nAnswer: Hit\nAnswer: Hit","Looking at the opponent's strategy from previous rounds, they tend to keep hitting for a relatively long time. The current threshold \\(N = 26\\) and our total is 17. Since there is a good chance that the opponent will continue to hit and may end up exceeding 26, and we are still far from 26, it is beneficial for us to hit to get closer to 26.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, understand the current situation:\n   - The threshold \\(N = 26\\). Your current card total is \\(24\\).\n   - You are close to the threshold but not over it.\n   - Looking at the opponent's strategy from previous rounds, the opponent usually keeps hitting until they stand.\n   - In previous rounds, the opponent often continues to take cards even when the situation is getting close to the threshold.\n2. Consider the risks and rewards of hitting and standing:\n   - If you hit:\n     - There is a risk of going over \\(26\\). Since your current total is \\(24\\), drawing a card with a value of \\(3\\) or more will make you exceed the threshold.\n   - If you stand:\n     - Your total is \\(24\\). Given the opponent's past behavior of hitting multiple times, there is a relatively high chance that the opponent may exceed \\(26\\) or at least get a lower - total than \\(24\\).\n\nBased on the above analysis, it is better to stand at this time.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Looking at the opponent's past behavior, they tend to hit multiple times in most rounds. Currently, our total is 14 and the threshold is 44, so there is a large gap. It is beneficial for us to try to get closer to the threshold. Therefore, we should choose to hit.\nAnswer: Hit","1. **Analysis of the opponent's strategy based on history**:\n   - Looking at the previous rounds, the opponent generally continues to hit multiple times. They seem to be quite aggressive in trying to get a high - scoring hand.\n   - Currently, our total is 20 and the threshold \\(N = 44\\). We are far from the threshold, so it is beneficial for us to try to increase our score.\n   - Since the opponent has a tendency to keep hitting, there is a high chance that they will either go over the threshold or get a relatively high score. We need to get closer to 44 without going over.\n2. **Decision - making**:\n   - Given that our current total is 20, taking another card (hitting) gives us a good chance of getting closer to 44. There is a relatively low risk of going over 44 with just one more card at this point.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n- First, let's analyze the opponent's strategy based on the history. In most previous rounds, the opponent keeps hitting until late in the game.\n- Currently, our total is 30 and the threshold \\(N = 44\\). We have some room to get closer to 44 without exceeding it.\n- If we hit, there is a chance to increase our total to be closer to 44. Since the deck is infinite, the probability of getting a card that doesn't make us exceed 44 is relatively high at this point.\n- Looking at the opponent, with only one known card of value 2, they are likely to keep hitting as per their past behavior.\n\nBased on the above analysis, it is beneficial for us to hit in this turn to try to get a better score.\n\nAnswer: Hit","First, let's analyze the situation. Our current total is 41, and the threshold N is 44. If we hit, there is a significant risk of exceeding 44 and losing the game. \n\nLooking at the opponent's previous behavior, they seem to be quite aggressive in taking cards. But we don't know the values of their unknown cards. However, since our total is already close to 44, it's a safer option to stand. \n\nIf we stand, we have a good chance of winning if the opponent exceeds 44 or gets a total lower than 41. If we hit and go over 44, we lose right away.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Looking at the opponent's past behavior, they tend to keep hitting until they either reach a high - value hand or exceed the threshold. Our current total is 14, which is quite far from the threshold of 28. We have a good chance of getting closer to 28 without exceeding it by taking another card. So, in this turn, it is a good idea to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","First, let's analyze the situation. Our current total is 21, and the threshold N is 28. We are 7 points away from the threshold.\n\nLooking at the opponent's fixed - strategy from the history:\n- In most rounds, the opponent keeps hitting for multiple turns. \n- Given that the opponent has only two cards so far and has already hit in the first turn, it's very likely that the opponent will continue to hit to get a higher total.\n\nIf we stand now, with our total of 21, there is a high chance that the opponent will keep hitting and get closer to 28 or even exceed it. But if we hit, we risk exceeding 28. Since the opponent's strategy indicates they will keep building their hand, standing at 21 gives us a good chance of winning.\n\nSo, the answer is to stand.\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis:\n- Currently, our total score is 6 and the threshold N is 48. There is a large gap between our current score and the threshold, so taking an additional card (Hit) has a very low risk of exceeding the threshold.\n- Based on the opponent's previous game records, the opponent tends to keep hitting cards in most cases. We can also continue to hit cards to increase our score and get closer to the threshold.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. The current total of my cards is 8, and the threshold N is 48. There is still a large gap between the current total and the threshold, so taking an additional card (Hit) is a reasonable choice as it is very unlikely to exceed the threshold with the current total.\n2. Looking at the opponent's history, the opponent often keeps hitting until the end in most rounds. And currently, I have a relatively low - value hand, so hitting to increase my total and get closer to the threshold is a good strategy.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Looking at the opponent's strategy from the history, they usually keep hitting for multiple turns before standing. Our current total is 15 and the threshold N is 48. There is a large gap between our current total and the threshold, so it is beneficial for us to continue hitting to get closer to the threshold.\nAnswer: Hit","Looking at the history, the opponent often hits multiple times. Our current total is 23 with a threshold of 48, and there is still a lot of room to increase the score without exceeding the threshold.

In most rounds, the opponent keeps hitting for several turns before standing. Also, looking at the current situation, our total is 31 and the threshold N is 48. There is a good margin to draw more cards to get closer to 48.\n\nSince the opponent seems to like to keep hitting in the early - mid stages of the game, and we have a relatively low total currently, it is beneficial for us to also keep hitting to increase our chances of getting closer to 48 without exceeding it.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, look at the opponent's strategy based on the history. In the history, when the opponent stands, it often means they think their current total is close to or might exceed the threshold if they take another card.\n2. Currently, our total is 38 and the threshold \\(N = 48\\). There is still a gap of \\(48 - 38=10\\) points before reaching the threshold.\n3. From the history, we can see that the opponent usually continues to take cards until they reach a certain point and then stand. Since the opponent has already stood in this round, it is very likely that their total is close to 48.\n4. If we take another card (Hit), there is a risk of exceeding 48. But considering that our current total is relatively far from 48, and there is a good chance that the opponent's total is close to 48, we can try to get closer to 48 to increase our winning probability.\n\nSo, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","First, let's analyze the situation. The current threshold \\(N = 48\\), and our total score is 39. The opponent has already stopped drawing cards.\n\nLooking at the opponent's past behavior, we can see that the opponent often continues to draw cards for a while and then stops. In this round, the opponent stopped after 6 turns. \n\nWe are currently at 39 points, which is relatively far from the threshold of 48. There is a good chance that we can draw a card to get closer to 48 without exceeding it. \n\nIf we stand now, we have 39 points. The opponent's total is unknown, but they stopped early. They might have a relatively low - score or they might be close to 48. If we hit, we could potentially increase our score to get closer to 48 and have a better chance of winning.\n\nLet's calculate the probability of exceeding 48. The maximum value of a card is 13 (King). If we draw a card, the worst - case scenario is that we draw a King. \\(39+13 = 52>48\\), but the probability of drawing a King is \\(\\frac{1}{13}\\) in an infinite deck. There are many other cards that can increase our score without exceeding 48.\n\nSo, it is a good decision to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

For example, even if you get a face - card (the maximum value is 13), \\(27 + 13=40\\) which is still less than 45.\n2. **Decision**:\n   - Based on the above analysis, it is a good choice to hit in this turn to increase your score and get closer to the threshold.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\nWe currently have a total of 32 points with a threshold N of 45. There is still a relatively large gap of 45 - 32 = 13 points from the threshold. \nLooking at the opponent's strategy in the previous round, they continued to hit multiple times until they decided to stand. In this round, they have also been hitting in each turn so far.\nThe probability of getting a card that won't make us exceed 45 is relatively high. For example, getting a card with a value of 1 - 13, most of the cases won't make us go over 45 immediately. \nBy taking another card (Hit), we have a good chance to get closer to 45 and potentially win the round.\n\nAnswer: Hit","1. **Analysis**:\n   - Currently, your card total is 35, and the threshold \\(N = 45\\). The difference between your current total and the threshold is \\(45 - 35=10\\).\n   - The opponent has already stood, which means they are likely satisfied with their current total.\n   - If you take a hit, there is a risk of exceeding 45. However, if you don't take a hit and the opponent's total is close to 45 (for example, if the opponent's total is 40 - 44), you may lose. But considering the large number of cards you have already drawn and the fact that there is a significant chance of exceeding 45 if you take another card.\n   - For instance, even a card with a value of 10 (a 10 - point card or a face - card) would make you exceed 45.\n   - Based on the risk - reward analysis, it is more prudent to stand at this point.\n2. **Output in the required format**:\nAnswer: Stand","First, let's analyze the situation. The current threshold \\(N = 25\\), and my total score is 19. If I hit, there is a chance that I might get a card that causes my total to exceed 25. However, the opponent's total is unknown as one of their cards is face - down. The opponent's known card is 4, so their minimum total is 4.\n\nLooking at the history, we can't directly infer the opponent's strategy from just two rounds, but generally, if I stand now with a total of 19, I am relatively close to 25. If I hit, there is a significant risk of going over 25.\n\nFor example, if I get a card worth 7 or more (such as 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K), my total will exceed 25. The probability of getting a card that will make me go over 25 is relatively high considering there are 7 out of 13 different card values (assuming an infinite deck) that will cause me to go over.\n\nSo, it is a safer option to stand at this point.\n\nAnswer: Stand","1. **Analysis**:\n   - The current threshold \\(N = 25\\). Your current card total is 19.\n   - Looking at the opponent's strategy in previous rounds, the opponent seems to be quite aggressive in taking hits. In Round 1, the opponent took multiple hits before standing, and in Round 2, the opponent also took many hits.\n   - If you stand with a total of 19, there is a good chance that the opponent, with their aggressive strategy, will keep hitting and may exceed 25. Since you already have a relatively close - to - 25 total of 19, standing gives you a good chance of winning. If you hit, there is a risk of exceeding 25.\n2. **Answer in required format**:\nAnswer: Stand","Looking at the history, we can try to analyze the opponent's strategy. In Round 1, the opponent hit until the 4th turn and then stood. In Round 2, the opponent hit until the 6th turn and then stood. In Round 3, the opponent hit on the 1st turn and then stood.\n\nIn this current round, with a threshold (N) of 25 and our total being 18, we are still far from the threshold. The opponent's face - up card is 7, and we don't know the other card. But considering that we are at 18 and there is a good chance to get closer to 25 without exceeding it, it is beneficial to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Looking at the history, in Round 3 with a threshold of 25, the opponent hit and managed to get close to 25. Since the opponent's strategy is fixed, it's likely they will try to get close to the current threshold of 25 as well.\n\nOur current total is 19. If we stand, and the opponent manages to get a total between 20 - 25, we will lose.\n\nIf we hit, there is a chance to get a card that can bring our total closer to 25 without exceeding it. For example, getting a 2 - 6 will improve our position. \n\nSo, the better move is to hit.\nAnswer: Hit","1. Analyze the situation:\n   - The current threshold \\(N = 25\\). Our total is 20 with the cards ['6', 'Q', 'A', 'A'].\n   - Looking at the opponent's strategy from the previous rounds:\n     - In Round 1 with \\(N = 39\\), the opponent kept hitting until the 4th turn and then stood.\n     - In Round 2 with \\(N = 45\\), the opponent kept hitting until the 6th turn and then stood.\n     - In Round 3 with \\(N = 25\\), the opponent hit on the 1st turn and then stood on the 2nd turn.\n     - In the current round (Round 4) with \\(N = 25\\), the opponent has hit in the first 2 turns. Since our total is 20 and close to 25, if we hit, there is a risk of exceeding 25. The opponent's strategy seems to be to keep hitting for a while to get closer to the threshold.

In this round, the opponent stood after the 5th turn, and you have continued to draw cards to reach a total of 37.\n- If you hit, there is a risk of exceeding 48. Since the opponent has already stopped, it is likely that their score is close to 48.

There is a high probability that drawing an additional card will not cause us to exceed 43. So, it is a good choice to request an additional card to get closer to the threshold.\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\nMy current total is 30 and the threshold N is 43. I still have a lot of room to get closer to 43 without exceeding it. If I stand now, I don't know the opponent's total and I may lose. By hitting, I have a chance to increase my total and get closer to 43 to increase my winning probability.\n\nAnswer: Hit\nAnswer: Hit","1. **Analysis of the current situation**:\n   - Your current card total is 37, and the threshold \\(N = 43\\). If you hit, there is a risk of exceeding 43. For example, if you draw a face - card (e.g., a K worth 13 points), \\(37+13 = 50>43\\). But if you stand, your total is 37.\n   - The opponent has one known card '8'. We don't know the values of the other three cards, but they also need to get close to 43 without exceeding it.\n   - Since your current total of 37 is relatively close to 43, hitting has a significant risk of going over the limit. Standing at 37 gives you a chance to win if the opponent exceeds 43 or has a lower total.\n2. **Decision**:\n   - Based on the above analysis, the better move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis: Currently, your total score is 37 which is less than the threshold N = 43. The opponent has one known card '8', and the total score of the opponent is unknown. Since your score is already relatively close to 43, taking another card may cause your score to exceed 43. So, it is wiser to stand at this time.\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis:\nYour current total score is 37, and the threshold N is 43. You are 6 points away from the threshold.\nThe opponent has an 8 - point card, and there are still 5 unknown cards. The opponent has been hitting in the previous turns, which indicates that the opponent is trying to get closer to the threshold.\nIf you choose to hit, there is a risk of exceeding 43. Since your current score is already relatively close to 43, it is more advisable to keep your current score. If you stand, you maintain your 37 - point total and wait for the opponent's result. If the opponent exceeds 43, you win; if the opponent also stays below 43, you compare the scores to determine the winner.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis:\nMy current total is 37 and the threshold N is 43. I have already chosen to stand. The opponent has been hitting continuously. \nIf I hit now, there is a risk of exceeding 43. Since I am already at 37, which is relatively close to 43, and I have no information indicating that the opponent has a very high - value hand at present, standing is a relatively safe strategy. Standing allows me to maintain my current score and wait for the opponent's result. If the opponent exceeds 43 and I don't, I win. If the opponent also stays below 43, the comparison will be based on who is closer to 43.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current situation, my total score is 5 which is far from the threshold of 31. I should take a risk and request an additional card to get closer to the threshold. So my move is 'Hit'.\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, understand the current situation:\n   - The current threshold \\(N = 31\\).\n   - Your current total score is 18. There is still a relatively large gap from the threshold of 31.\n   - Looking at the opponent's situation, the opponent has a \\(Q\\) (worth 12 points). We don't know the values of the other two unknown - cards, but it's possible that the opponent's score is close to or exceeds 31.\n   - In the previous round, the opponent kept hitting even when the total was already high. This indicates that the opponent has a relatively aggressive strategy of hitting as many times as possible.\n2. Consider the possible outcomes of hitting:\n   - Since we are far from the threshold of 31, hitting another card has a high probability of not exceeding 31. For example, if we get a low - value card like an Ace (1 point), a 2, 3, etc., our score will still be well below 31 and closer to it, increasing our chance of winning.\n   - If we stand now, with a score of 18, and the opponent may keep hitting and get a score closer to 31 or not exceed 31, we may lose.\n\nSo, it is a good choice to hit in this situation.\n\nAnswer: Hit","1. Analyze the current situation:\n   - The current threshold \\(N = 31\\). Your total card value is 23.\n   - In the previous round, the opponent kept hitting even when it was not a very good idea (eventually exceeding the threshold). This indicates that the opponent has an aggressive hitting - until - high - total strategy.\n   - The opponent has a 'Q' (worth 12 points) showing, and we don't know the values of the other three cards. The opponent may continue to hit and risk exceeding 31.\n   - If you hit, there is a chance that you may exceed 31. For example, if you draw a card with a value of 9 or more (\\(23+9 = 32>31\\)). But if you stand, you are at 23. The opponent may still hit and exceed 31, giving you the win.\n   - Standing seems like a safer option as you are already relatively close to 31 and the opponent's strategy from the previous round suggests they may over - extend.\n2. Format the answer:\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis:\n1. Calculate the current situation:\n   - Our current total is 22, and the threshold \\(N = 33\\). So we have a difference of \\(33 - 22=11\\) from the threshold.\n   - Looking at the opponent's situation, they have a face - up 'J' (worth 11 points), and we don't know the value of the face - down card.\n2. Analyze the opponent's strategy based on history:\n   - In Round 1, the opponent kept hitting even when we had already stood, and finally exceeded the threshold.\n   - In Round 2, the opponent stopped hitting at a reasonable time and stood.\n   - Overall, the opponent seems to be more inclined to take risks and keep hitting.\n3. Consider the probability of our situation:\n   - If we hit, the probability of getting a card that does not make us exceed 33 is relatively high. For example, if we get an ace (1 point), 2 - 10, our total will still be within the limit. And getting a card that can bring us closer to 33 is beneficial for winning.\n   - If we stand, given the opponent's risk - taking strategy, they may keep hitting and get a high - value hand. If they don't exceed 33 and get closer to 33 than us, we will lose.\n\nSo, it is more advisable for us to hit in this turn.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n- In the previous two rounds, the opponent seemed to keep hitting even when there was a risk of exceeding the threshold. \n- Currently, our total is 23 with a threshold of 33, and we still have some room to increase our score. Since the opponent has a tendency to keep hitting and might exceed the threshold, we can also try to get closer to the threshold by hitting.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\nSince your total score of 35 has already exceeded the threshold N = 33, no matter what your next move is, you won't be able to win this round. If the opponent also exceeds 33, it will be a draw. If the opponent does not exceed 33, you will lose. Standing at this point won't change the fact that you've exceeded the limit, and hitting will also not bring a better result. So the best move is to stand.\n\nOutput format:\nBased on the analysis, the answer is to Stand.\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis:\n1. First, look at the opponent's strategy based on the history. In the previous rounds, the opponent tends to keep hitting even when the total is getting close to or exceeding the threshold. For example, in Round 1, the opponent kept hitting until the total reached 52 when the threshold was 43; in Round 3, the opponent kept hitting until the total reached 45 when the threshold was 33.\n2. Our current total is 20, and the threshold is 49. There is still a large gap between our current total and the threshold. So, it is a good opportunity to request an additional card to get closer to the threshold.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the history, the opponent seems to be very aggressive in taking cards.

If you hit, there is a risk of exceeding 49.\n- Looking at the opponent's strategy from the history, the opponent keeps hitting in most rounds.

Evaluate the decision to hit or stand:\n   - If you hit, there is a risk of exceeding \\(N = 49\\). For example, if you draw a card with a value of 8 or more, you will exceed the threshold.\n   - Since your current total is \\(42\\), which is relatively close to \\(49\\), and the opponent seems to be a risk - taker (always hitting), it is safer to stand. By standing, you hope that the opponent will exceed the threshold while you stay below it.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis: Currently, my total score is 42 which is less than the threshold of 49.

Since the opponent seems likely to continue hitting and potentially go over the threshold, we should also take the opportunity to get closer to 50 without exceeding it. So, it is advisable to hit.\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\nWe currently have a total of 32 points with a threshold of 50. Looking at the opponent's strategy from the previous rounds, the opponent seems to keep hitting even when we have already stood. So far, our total is quite far from the threshold of 50. There is a relatively low risk of exceeding 50 if we take one more card. By taking another card, we have a chance to get closer to 50 and increase our winning probability.\n\nAnswer: Hit\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis: Currently, your total card value is 45 and the threshold N is 50. Taking another card (Hit) has a high risk of exceeding 50, while your current total is already relatively close to 50. Based on the opponent's past strategies, they tend to keep hitting. Standing now gives a good chance to win if the opponent exceeds 50. So, it is wiser to choose Stand.\nAnswer: Stand","Looking at the history, the opponent seems to have a tendency to keep hitting even when it might cause them to exceed the threshold. Currently, our total is 6 and the threshold is 28. We are far from the threshold, so it's very beneficial for us to take another card to get closer to 28. \nAnswer: Hit","Looking at the history, the opponent seems to have a tendency to keep hitting until their total likely exceeds the threshold. Currently, our total is 9 and the threshold is 28, so there is a lot of room to get closer to 28. By hitting, we have a good chance of increasing our score and getting closer to 28 without exceeding it. \nAnswer: Hit","1. **Analysis**:\n   - First, understand the opponent's strategy from the history. In all previous rounds, the opponent keeps hitting until the very end. So, it is highly likely that the opponent will continue to hit in this round.\n   - The current total of my cards is 19, and the threshold \\(N = 28\\). If I stand, the opponent may keep hitting and may exceed 28 (based on their past behavior).\n   - If I hit, there is a risk of exceeding 28. But considering the opponent's tendency to keep hitting, if I can get closer to 28 without exceeding it, I have a better chance of winning. The probability of getting a card that will not make me exceed 28 is relatively high. For example, getting a card with a value of 1 - 9 will keep me under 28.\n   - So, the better move is to hit.\n2. **Output in the required format**:\nAnswer: Hit","1. Analyze the situation:\n   - The current threshold \\(N = 28\\). Your total card value is 27.\n   - From the history, we can observe that the opponent tends to keep hitting.\n   - If you hit, there is a high risk of exceeding 28. For example, if you draw any card with a value of 2 or more, you will lose.\n   - If you stand, the opponent has a high - probability of hitting until they either exceed 28 or get close to it. Since your total is already 27, close to the threshold, it is a good strategy to stand and let the opponent take the risk of exceeding 28.\n2. Output the answer in the required format:\nAnswer: Stand","Looking at the history, the opponent seems to have a tendency to keep hitting even when the total is getting close to or might exceed the threshold.\n\nOur current total is 13, and the threshold is 31.

It is very likely that we can get closer to 31 by hitting without exceeding it.\n\nSo, in this turn, we should choose to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Looking at the history, the opponent seems to have a tendency to keep hitting even when the threshold is relatively low. Currently, our total is 17 and the threshold is 31. We still have a lot of room to increase our score without exceeding the threshold.

If I hit, there is a high probability that I will exceed 31 and lose. So I should stand.\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis: Currently, my total card value is 31, which exactly reaches the threshold N = 31. If I choose to hit, there is a high probability that my total will exceed 31 and I will lose. Since I've already reached the threshold, standing is the safest option.

We still have a relatively large margin to increase our score without exceeding the threshold.\n- Looking at the history, in the previous round, both we and the opponent kept hitting until close to the threshold. In this round, since our current score is far from the threshold, hitting a card has a high probability of increasing our score and getting closer to the threshold without exceeding it.\n- If we stand now, our score is 19, which is relatively far from the threshold, and the opponent may get a higher score by hitting more cards and win.\n\nSo, the better move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","First, let's analyze the situation.

So, there is a room of \\(37 - 29=8\\) points to safely draw a card without exceeding the threshold.\n   - Looking at the history, in the previous round, both you and the opponent kept hitting until a certain point. The opponent is likely to keep hitting as well in this round.\n   - Since the probability of drawing a card with a value of 8 or less is relatively high (there are 8 number - cards from 1 - 8 in a standard deck), hitting gives you a chance to get closer to the threshold \\(N = 37\\) and potentially win the round.\n2. **Decision**:\n   - Based on the above analysis, it is a good idea to hit in this turn.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis: Currently, my total score is 32, and the threshold N is 37. There is a difference of 5 points from the threshold. Drawing another card, if the value of the card is 1 - 5, I can get closer to the threshold without exceeding it, which will increase my chance of winning. If the value is 6 - 13, I will exceed the threshold and may lose. However, considering the opponent has multiple unknown cards, there is a high possibility that their score can reach a value close to or exceeding mine. To increase the probability of victory, it is still worth taking a risk to draw one more card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\nCurrently, your total card value is 34 and the threshold \\(N = 37\\). If you hit, there is a risk of exceeding 37. Since your total is already quite close to 37, standing gives you a good chance of winning. The opponent has a Jack, and their total is unknown, but standing at this point with 34 gives you a relatively safe position. If the opponent exceeds 37 or has a lower total than 34, you win.\n\nAnswer: Stand\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the history, we can observe that the opponent seems to be quite aggressive in taking hits.

First, understand the current situation:\n   - The threshold \\(N = 38\\).\n   - Our current total is 33, and we have already made one 'hit' move.\n   - The opponent has a '10' and two unknown - cards, and they also made a 'hit' move in the first turn.\n2. Then, look at the opponent's past behavior:\n   - In previous rounds, the opponent usually keeps hitting multiple times. For example, in Round 1, they hit until the 3rd turn; in Round 2, they hit until the 6th turn; in Round 3, they hit until the 5th turn; in Round 4, they hit until the 6th turn.\n3. Consider the risk and potential gain of hitting:\n   - If we hit, there is a risk of exceeding 38. But if we stand, given the opponent's past tendency to keep hitting, they may get closer to 38 or even exceed it.\n   - The probability of getting a card that will not make us exceed 38:\n     - The cards that will not make us exceed 38 if we hit are \\(A\\) (1 point), 2 - 5.\n     - Since the deck is infinite, the probability of getting a non - busting card is relatively reasonable. For example, there are 5 non - busting cards (\\(A,2,3,4,5\\)) out of 13 different card values.\n   - By hitting, we have a chance to get closer to 38 and increase our chance of winning, as long as we don't exceed 38.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the better move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Since my total score of 44 has already exceeded the threshold (N = 38), no matter what actions I take in the following process, I will not win this round.

Analyze the current situation:\n   - Our total score is 27, and the threshold \\(N = 37\\). The difference between our current score and the threshold is \\(37 - 27=10\\).\n   - We know very little about the opponent's cards. The opponent has at least 1 point (from the ace), but the values of the other 5 unknown cards are unknown.\n   - If we take a hit, we have a chance to get closer to 37. However, if the card we draw has a value greater than 10, we will exceed 37 and lose if the opponent does not exceed 37.\n   - Since our current score is relatively far from the threshold, and there is a good chance that we can draw a card that will increase our score without exceeding 37, it is beneficial to take a hit.\n2.

Currently, our total score is 24 and the threshold N is 42. We are quite far from the threshold.\n2. Looking at the history, in the previous round, both we and the opponent kept hitting until the end. This indicates that the opponent's strategy seems to be to keep hitting for a high - score hand.\n3. Since our current score is far from the threshold, taking another card (Hit) has a relatively low risk of exceeding 42 immediately, and it can increase our chances of getting closer to 42 to win the game.\n\nAnswer: Hit","1.

The opponent already has a 'K' (worth 13 points), and even if the other unknown - cards are small, there is a high chance they will continue to hit and may exceed the threshold.\n   - Since our total is only 16, hitting another card has a high probability of not exceeding the threshold and getting closer to 40.\n2. Conclusion:\n   - It is beneficial for us to request an additional card (Hit) to increase our total and get closer to the threshold.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the history, the opponent often continues to hit until they exceed the threshold. Currently, our total is 18 and the threshold is 40. There is a large gap, and since the opponent has already stood, it is very likely that they are close to or have exceeded 40.

Our total card value is 27, and we are well - below the threshold.\n   - The opponent has a face - up \\(K\\) (worth 13 points). Since the opponent has already stood in the previous two turns, it is likely that they are close to or at a value where they think they can win or at least not exceed 40.\n   - If we hit, there is a chance to get a card that can bring our total closer to 40 without exceeding it. The probability of getting a card that will make us exceed 40 is relatively low considering our current total of 27. For example, we would need a card worth 14 or more to exceed 40 immediately.\n   - If we stand, we have a relatively low total compared to what the opponent might have. Given that the opponent has a \\(K\\) and has already decided to stand, they might have a total close to 40.\n2.

First, understand the current situation. The threshold \\(N = 40\\), our total score is \\(30\\), and the opponent has a face - up \\(K\\) (worth \\(13\\) points) with three unknown cards and has already decided to stand.\n2. Analyze the opponent's possible scores:\n   - The minimum score of the opponent is \\(13\\) (if the three unknown cards are all \\(A\\)s, \\(13 + 1+1 + 1=16\\)). The maximum score of the opponent is \\(13+13 + 13+13 = 52\\). But we know from the history that the opponent often exceeds the threshold.\n3. Evaluate the risk and benefit of hitting or standing:\n   - If we stand, our score is \\(30\\). We may win if the opponent exceeds \\(40\\), but if the opponent's score is between \\(31\\) and \\(40\\), we will lose.\n   - If we hit, there is a risk of exceeding \\(40\\). However, if we can get a card that makes our score closer to \\(40\\) without exceeding it, our chance of winning increases. Since the opponent has already stood, it is likely that their score is fixed and may be high. Given that our current score of \\(30\\) is relatively far from \\(40\\), hitting has a potential to improve our situation.\n\nSo, the better move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1.

Consider the opponent's previous strategy:\n   - From the history, the opponent usually keeps hitting in the early turns.\n3. Evaluate the risk and reward of hitting:\n   - Since our current total is only \\(8\\), there is a very low risk of exceeding \\(32\\) by taking one more card. And getting a new card can increase our total and get closer to \\(32\\), which will increase our chance of winning.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the best move in this turn is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the history, the opponent tends to keep hitting even when the situation might be risky.

The risk of hitting is relatively small as the gap is 6, and the probability of getting a card that makes you exceed 37 is not extremely high.\n\nDecision: Hit\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n- Currently, your total card value is 32 and the threshold N is 37. There is a difference of 37 - 32 = 5 points from the threshold.\n- The opponent has already decided to stand at turn 4. Looking at the history, the opponent often stands when their hand value might be close to the threshold. \n- If you hit, there is a risk of exceeding 37. For example, if you get a card with a value of 6 or more, you will lose. Since the opponent has already stood, it is very likely that their value is close to 37 but not exceeding it. \n- Standing at this point can ensure that you do not exceed 37. And with a value of 32, you have a chance to win if the opponent's final value is over 37 or is lower than 32.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Looking at the history, the opponent often continues to hit even when the threshold is not very high, and they frequently end up exceeding the threshold. Our current total is 11, which is quite far from the threshold of 37. So, it is beneficial for us to hit to get closer to the threshold.\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the history, the opponent often continues to hit until the end, and it frequently exceeds the threshold. Currently, our total is 15 and the threshold is 37. We still have a lot of room to draw cards without exceeding the threshold. So, we should choose to hit to get closer to the threshold N.\nAnswer: Hit","1. Analyze the situation:\n   - The current threshold \\(N = 37\\). Our total score is 25, and we are still far from the threshold.\n   - Looking at the opponent's visible card, they have a 'K' (worth 13 points). We don't know the value of their other three cards, but with the history of previous rounds, the opponent seems to be quite aggressive in taking cards.\n   - Since our current total of 25 is well - below 37, taking another card (hitting) gives us a good chance to get closer to 37 without exceeding it easily. If we stand now, we may lose to the opponent if they get a good combination of cards and get closer to 37.\n2. Decision:\n   - We should choose to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n- Our current total is 35, and the threshold N is 37. If we hit, there is a risk of exceeding 37. Since we are already very close to 37, and from the history records, we can see that the opponent often takes a relatively aggressive hitting strategy and may exceed the threshold. Standing now gives us a good chance to win as long as the opponent exceeds 37.\n- If we hit and get a card with a value of 3 or more, we will exceed 37. So it is more reasonable to stand at this time.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Looking at the history, the opponent seems to be quite aggressive and often keeps hitting until they either exceed the threshold or reach a relatively high total.\n\nOur current total is 15, and the threshold is 47. There is a large gap between our current total and the threshold, so we have a lot of room to increase our score. \n\nIf we hit, we have a good chance of getting closer to the threshold without exceeding it. Since the opponent has a tendency to over - shoot the threshold, by hitting and getting a good hand, we can increase our chances of winning.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, look at the opponent's behavior in previous rounds. In most rounds, the opponent keeps hitting until the end or exceeds the threshold.\n2. Our current total is 19, and the threshold \\(N = 47\\). We still have a lot of room to increase our score without exceeding the threshold.\n3. If we stand now, our score is only 19, which is far from the threshold. And considering the opponent's previous behavior, they are likely to get a relatively high - scoring hand. So we should continue to hit to get closer to the threshold.\n\nAnswer: Hit\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the history, the opponent often continues to hit even when there is a risk of exceeding the threshold. Our current total is 24 with a threshold of 47, so we still have a lot of room to increase our score. We should take another card to get closer to 47.\nAnswer: Hit","1. **Analysis**:\n   - We know from the history that the opponent often keeps hitting until the end. Our current total is 26 and the threshold \\(N = 47\\). We still have a large margin to increase our score without exceeding the threshold.\n   - Since the opponent seems to be very aggressive in taking cards, we can try to get closer to the threshold. The probability of getting a card that will not make us exceed 47 is relatively high at this point. For example, if we get a card with a value of 1 - 21, we will still be below the threshold.\n   - So, it is a good idea to take another card (Hit) to increase our chances of getting closer to 47.\n2. **Answer in the required format**:\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\nWe first look at the opponent's strategy from the history. The opponent often continues to hit until the end in most rounds, which means they are quite aggressive in getting more cards.\nOur current total is 32, and the threshold \\(N = 47\\). There is still a relatively large gap between our current total and the threshold (\\(47 - 32=15\\)). \nSince the opponent is likely to keep hitting and may end up exceeding the threshold, we have room to increase our total to get closer to 47. Taking another card has a good chance of increasing our score without exceeding 47. So, it is a good choice to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n- Currently, your total card value is 40 with a threshold \\(N = 47\\). You are 7 points away from exceeding the threshold.\n- Looking at the opponent's strategy from the history, the opponent often continues to draw cards even in the later turns. \n- The opponent already has a '10' card. If they keep drawing cards, there is a high chance that they may exceed 47.\n- Since you are relatively close to the threshold and not exceeding it yet, standing at this point can be a good choice.

There is a gap of \\(39 - 32=7\\) between your total and the threshold.\n   - The opponent has an 'A' (worth 1 point) and three unknown - cards.

The minimum value of a new card is 1 (an Ace), and the maximum is 13 (a King).\n   - If we hit and get a card with a value of 8 or more, we will exceed the threshold of 39 and lose if the opponent does not exceed 39.

If the opponent also stays below 39, you may still win if their total is less than 32.\n\nDecision: Stand\nAnswer: Stand","1. **Analysis of the situation**:\n   - Your total score is 32, and the threshold \\(N = 39\\). You have already chosen to stand, which means you are satisfied with your current score and do not want to risk going over 39 by taking another card.\n   - The opponent has an 'A' (worth 1 point) and 5 unknown - cards. We don't know the opponent's total, but since the opponent has been hitting in each turn so far, they are trying to get closer to 39.\n   - If we consider the best - case scenario for the opponent, they might be able to get close to 39 without going over. However, if we stand, we have a score of 32. If the opponent goes over 39, we win. If the opponent also stays below 39, we still have a chance to win depending on how close they get to 39 compared to us.\n   - Taking another card at this point is very risky. If we take a card and go over 39, we will lose immediately if the opponent stays below 39.\n2. **Decision**:\n   - Based on the above analysis, the best move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis: Currently, my total card value is 32, which is less than the threshold N = 39. The opponent has an Ace and several unknown - cards, and the opponent has been hitting continuously. Since my score is already relatively close to 39, taking another card has a high risk of exceeding 39. So, it is wiser to stand and wait for the opponent's result.\nAnswer: Stand","Currently, my total card value is 10 and the threshold N is 28. There is still a large gap between my current total and the threshold, so it is beneficial for me to get an additional card to increase my total and get closer to 28.\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. Calculate the current situation:\n   - Your current card total is 17, and the threshold \\(N = 28\\). There is still a lot of room to get closer to 28 without exceeding it.\n   - The opponent has a 'K' (worth 13 points). Even if the two unknown - cards are the lowest - value aces (1 point each), the opponent's minimum total is \\(13 + 1+1=15\\).\n2. Consider the opponent's strategy based on the previous round:\n   - In the previous round, the opponent kept hitting even when the player had already stood. This indicates that the opponent has an aggressive strategy of continuously taking cards.\n3. Evaluate the decision to hit or stand:\n   - If you stand now with a total of 17, the opponent has a high chance of getting closer to 28 (since they are aggressive) and may even win.\n   - If you hit, there is a relatively low risk of exceeding 28 at this stage. For example, if you get a card with a value of 1 - 11, you will still be under 28.\n\nSo, the better move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n- Currently, your total score is 18, and the threshold \\(N = 28\\). There is still a gap of \\(28 - 18=10\\) points to reach the threshold.\n- The opponent has a 'K' (worth 13 points) and two unknown - cards. The opponent has already decided to stand at turn 2, which may indicate that they think their score is close to or already exceeds the threshold.\n- Since there is still a relatively large gap between your current score and the threshold, it is beneficial to take another card to get closer to the threshold.\n\nAnswer: Hit\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, understand the current situation:\n   - The threshold \\(N = 28\\).\n   - Your total card value is 21.\n   - The opponent has a 'K' (worth 13 points) and two unknown - cards. The opponent has already stood.\n2. Consider the possible scenarios if you hit:\n   - If you hit and get a card such that your total exceeds 28, you lose. For example, if you get a card worth 8 or more (\\(21 + 8=29\\)), you will exceed the threshold.\n   - If you stand, your total is 21. The opponent's minimum total is 13 (only considering the 'K'). The maximum total of the opponent is \\(13 + 13+13 = 39\\) (assuming all unknown cards are 'K's). Since the opponent has already stood, we don't know exactly their total, but standing at 21 gives you a chance. If the opponent's total exceeds 28, you win. If the opponent's total is less than 21, you win. If the opponent's total is between 21 and 28, you lose.\n3. Based on the analysis, it is safer to stand at this point to avoid the risk of exceeding the threshold.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis:\n- First, let's analyze the opponent's strategy based on the history. In Round 1, when the threshold \\(N = 39\\) and the opponent started, they kept hitting until their total exceeded the threshold. In Round 2, when \\(N=28\\),  they hit once and then stood. Overall, it seems that the opponent has a relatively aggressive strategy of hitting multiple times.\n- Currently, our total is 21 and the threshold \\(N = 41\\). We still have a lot of room to increase our score. By hitting, we have a good chance of getting closer to the threshold without exceeding it.\n\nSo, the better move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the history, the opponent seems to be quite aggressive in taking hits. Currently, our total is 27 and the threshold is 41. We have some room to increase our score. Since we are still far from the threshold and the opponent's aggressive strategy might lead them to over - exceed the threshold, it is beneficial for us to take another card to get closer to the threshold. So, I suggest we take a hit.\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, understand the opponent's strategy based on historical data:\n   - In Round 1, the opponent kept hitting until their total exceeded the threshold. When the threshold was 39, the opponent started with 'A', 'A', '6' and continued to hit multiple times until reaching a total of 44.\n   - In Round 2, the opponent stopped hitting after getting a total of 29 when the threshold was 28.\n   - Overall, the opponent seems to have a strategy of hitting until they think they are close to or exceed the threshold.\n2. Analyze the current situation:\n   - The current threshold \\(N = 41\\). Your total is 30 with cards ['J', '10', '6', '3'].\n   - The opponent has a 'K' (worth 13 points) and three unknown - cards. The opponent has also been hitting in the first two turns, which indicates they are likely trying to get closer to the threshold.\n   - If you hit, there is a chance to get closer to 41. Since your current total is 30, getting a card that does not make you exceed 41 can increase your chances of winning. For example, if you get a card with a value of 1 - 11, you will still be below 41.\n   - Considering the opponent's strategy of hitting until they are close to or exceed the threshold, it is beneficial for you to try to get closer to 41 as well.\n\nSo, the best move is to Hit.\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\nMy current total is 37 and the threshold N is 41. If I hit, there is a risk of exceeding 41. Looking at the opponent's visible card, they have a 'K' (worth 13 points). Although we don't know the values of their other cards, from the previous two - round records, the opponent seems to be quite aggressive in taking cards.\nIn the first round, when the threshold was 39, they kept hitting until they exceeded 39. In the second round, when the threshold was 28, they also took multiple cards and finally exceeded 28. \nMy current total of 37 is already quite close to 41. If I stand, there is a good chance that the opponent, with their aggressive strategy, will exceed 41 while I stay below it. So, it is more advisable to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis:\n- The current total of my cards is 37, and the threshold \\(N = 41\\). So I am 4 points away from exceeding the threshold.\n- The opponent has a face - up 'K' (worth 13 points), and we don't know the values of the other 5 unknown cards. But from the previous two rounds, we can observe that the opponent has a relatively aggressive strategy of always hitting.\n- If I hit, there is a risk of exceeding 41. For example, if I draw a 5 or higher, I will lose.\n- Since my current total is 37, which is already quite close to 41, and considering the opponent's aggressive hitting strategy, there is a high chance that the opponent may exceed 41. So it is more prudent for me to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis:\nMy current total score is 37, and the threshold N is 41. If I hit, there is a high risk of exceeding 41. Looking at the opponent's strategy from the history, they keep hitting even when it might lead to exceeding the threshold. They already have a 'K' (worth 13 points), and even if their unknown cards are small - value cards, they may still exceed 41 by continuing to hit. So, it is more beneficial for me to stand and wait for the opponent's result.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Looking at the history, the opponent seems to keep hitting until they either win or exceed the threshold.\nOur current total is 14 and the threshold is 27. We are quite far from the threshold, and since the opponent has a tendency to keep hitting and might exceed the threshold, it is beneficial for us to try to get closer to 27. So we should request an additional card (Hit).\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, understand the opponent's strategy from the history. In all previous rounds, the opponent keeps hitting until the end. So, we can assume the opponent will continue to hit in this round.\n2. Consider our current situation. Our total is 23 with a threshold of 27. If we hit, there is a risk of exceeding 27. If we stand, given the opponent's strategy of continuous hitting, there is a high chance that the opponent will exceed 27.\n3. Calculate the probability of not exceeding 27 if we hit. The cards that will not make us exceed 27 are A (1 point), 2, 3, and 4.\n   - The probability of drawing a card that won't make us exceed 27: There are 4 favorable card - values out of 13 possible card - values. So the probability is \\(P=\\frac{4}{13}\\approx0.308\\). The probability of exceeding 27 if we hit is \\(1 - \\frac{4}{13}=\\frac{9}{13}\\approx0.692\\).\n4. Since the opponent is likely to keep hitting and exceed 27, and the risk of exceeding 27 ourselves if we hit is relatively high, it is a better choice to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the history, the opponent tends to keep hitting until they likely exceed the threshold. My current total is 11, which is far from the threshold of 38. So, it is a good idea to hit to get closer to the threshold.\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the history, the opponent seems to be quite aggressive in taking hits. Our current total is 19, which is far from the threshold of 38. So, it is beneficial for us to take another card to get closer to the threshold. \nAnswer: Hit","Based on the history, the opponent tends to keep hitting even when it might lead to exceeding the threshold. My current total is 30 and the threshold is 38. I have some room to increase my score without exceeding the threshold easily. So, I should hit to try and get closer to 38.\nAnswer: Hit","Since my total score of 42 has already exceeded the threshold of 38, no matter what the opponent does, if they don't exceed 38, they will win, and if they also exceed 38, it will be a draw. Continuing to hit won't change the situation for me, so I should stand.\nAnswer: Stand","Since your total score is 42 which exceeds the threshold N = 38, your outcome depends on whether the opponent also exceeds 38. However, based on the opponent's known card ('6') and the fact that they are still hitting, there is a possibility they may or may not exceed 38. But we can't be sure. Since we know for certain that you have exceeded 38, if the opponent doesn't exceed 38, you lose. The safest bet considering the situation is to assume that the best - case scenario for the opponent is that they don't exceed 38. So you lose this round.\nAnswer: Lose","Since my total score has already exceeded the threshold (N = 38), no matter what the opponent does, as long as the opponent's total score does not exceed 38, the opponent will win. And from the history records, it seems that the opponent likes to keep hitting until the end. So there is a high probability that the opponent will keep hitting and may also exceed 38, resulting in a draw. In this situation, my best move is to stand and wait for the result.\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis:\nI have already exceeded the threshold of 38 (my total is 42). Whether the opponent exceeds 38 or not, as long as I don't draw another card, if the opponent exceeds 38, it's a draw; if the opponent doesn't exceed 38, I lose. But if I draw another card, my total will further increase and there's no chance of winning. So I should stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Since your total card value is 42 which exceeds the threshold N = 38, you have already lost the round if the opponent does not exceed 38. The opponent is still taking cards, but regardless of their result, as long as they don't also exceed 38, you lose. So there's no point in taking another card. You should stand.\nAnswer: Stand","Looking at the opponent's strategy from the previous rounds, the opponent tends to keep hitting multiple times in most rounds. Currently, our total is 12 and the threshold is 43, which means we have a large margin to get closer to the threshold. So it is beneficial for us to request an additional card.\nAnswer: Hit","Looking at the history, the opponent has a tendency to keep hitting even when the total might be close to or exceed the threshold. In the current round, my total is 23 and the threshold is 43, so there is still a significant gap.

My current total is 35 and the threshold is 43. There is still a significant gap to reach the threshold. So, it is beneficial for me to hit to get closer to the threshold.\nAnswer: Hit","Looking at the history, the opponent seems to keep hitting until they either win or exceed the threshold. Our current total is 37 and the threshold is 43, so we are relatively close to the threshold. If we stand now, there is a good chance that the opponent will keep hitting and either exceed the threshold or get a total lower than ours.\n\nIf we hit, there is a risk of exceeding the threshold. Since we are already close to the threshold and the opponent's behavior indicates they are likely to over - shoot, it is wiser to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis:\n1. First, understand the opponent's strategy from the history: In previous rounds, the opponent usually keeps hitting even after the player has stood. It seems the opponent is quite aggressive in trying to get a high - value hand.\n2. Evaluate your own hand: Your current total is 37, and the threshold \\(N = 43\\). There is a gap of \\(43 - 37=6\\) points.\n3. Consider the risk - reward: If you hit, there is a chance to get a card that can bring your total closer to 43 without exceeding it. For example, getting a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 would be beneficial. The probability of getting such a card is relatively high as there are 5 favorable outcomes out of 13 possible card values in a deck.\n4. Given the opponent's aggressive strategy, it's likely that the opponent will keep hitting and may exceed 43. But to increase your own chance of winning, getting closer to 43 is a good move.\n\nSo, the better move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\nWe have a total of 37 points and the threshold N is 43. There is a difference of 43 - 37 = 6 points between our current total and the threshold.\n\nLooking at the opponent's strategy from the history records, in most rounds, the opponent keeps hitting even after we have stopped. In previous rounds, the opponent often exceeded the threshold.\n\nSince our current total is relatively close to the threshold and there is a good chance that the opponent will exceed the threshold based on past behavior, we should stand to avoid the risk of exceeding 43 ourselves.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Looking at the history, the opponent has a tendency to keep hitting even when it might be risky. My current total is 37 and the threshold is 43. If I stand, there's a good chance the opponent will keep hitting and either go over 43 or at least not get closer to 43 than me. Hitting now might put me at risk of going over 43. So, it's better for me to stand.\nAnswer: Stand","Looking at the opponent's face - up card which is a 'Q' (worth 12 points), and the current threshold N = 28. Our current total is 11. \nFrom the history, we can observe that the opponent has a tendency to keep hitting even when they are getting close to or exceeding the threshold. \nSince our current total of 11 is quite far from the threshold of 28, we should take another card to increase our total and get closer to 28. So, the best move is to 'Hit'.\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the history, the opponent has a tendency to keep hitting even when it may lead to exceeding the threshold.

We still have a large gap to reach the threshold.\n   - Looking at the opponent's previous - round strategy, in the previous round, when the threshold was also 47, the opponent hit multiple times until the 5th turn and then stood. At the start of the 5th turn in the previous round, the opponent's total was likely not close enough to 47, so they continued to hit.\n   - Since our current total is far from 47, and based on the opponent's previous behavior, it is beneficial for us to continue to try to get closer to 47. So, we should choose to hit.\n2. **Answer in the required format**:\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\nCurrently, our total score is 24, and the threshold N is 47. We are quite far from the threshold. Looking at the opponent's previous round's play style, they kept hitting multiple times and then decided to stand. In this round, they have also been hitting so far. \nIf we stand now, our score of 24 is relatively low and the opponent is likely to get a higher score closer to 47 and win. By hitting, we have a chance to increase our score to be closer to 47. There is a risk of exceeding 47, but considering the current situation, the potential benefit of getting a higher score outweighs the risk. So, we should choose to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","In the previous round, when the threshold was 47, the opponent stood when their total was 44. So it seems the opponent's strategy is to stand when they get close to the threshold. Our current total is 35 which is quite far from 47. There is a good chance that we can get closer to 47 without exceeding it by taking another card. So we should Hit.\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis: Currently, your card total is 42, and the threshold N is 47. There are still 5 points available. If you take a hit, there is a risk of exceeding 47. Looking at the opponent's behavior in this round, they stood in the 4th turn. From the previous round, we know that the opponent will stand when they think they are close to N. Since your current total is 42, and you are relatively close to N. Standing at this time can avoid the risk of exceeding N, and wait to see if the opponent exceeds N or has a lower total than you. So it is a more reasonable choice to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","1. **Analysis**:\n   - Currently, our total card value is 14, and the threshold \\(N = 38\\). We are far from the threshold, so it is beneficial to take another card to get closer to the threshold.\n   - Looking at the opponent's situation, they have a Queen (worth 12 points) and an unknown card. But we don't have enough information from just this to change our decision based on their current hand.\n   - From the history, in previous rounds, both when we were far from the threshold and the opponent, we were actively taking cards to get closer to the threshold.\n2. **Decision**:\n   - Based on the above analysis, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, understand the current situation:\n   - The threshold \\(N = 38\\).\n   - My current total is 24 with cards ['Q', '2', '10'].\n   - The opponent has a 'Q' (worth 12 points) and two unknown cards.\n   - Looking at the history, in the previous rounds with a relatively high - threshold of 47, the opponent seemed to hit a few times and then stand. But now the threshold is 38.\n   - If I hit, there is a chance to get closer to 38. For example, if I get a small - value card like an 'A' (1 point), my total will be 25, which is still far from 38. If I get a card like a '2' - '10', I can get closer to 38. Even if I get a face - card, there is still a chance that the opponent may exceed 38.\n   - If I stand now with a total of 24, the opponent may be able to get a combination of cards to get closer to 38 and win.\n2. Conclusion:\n   - It is more beneficial to hit to increase my chances of getting closer to 38 and winning the round.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, understand the opponent's strategy from the history:\n   - In the previous two rounds, the opponent hits multiple times and then stands. This indicates that the opponent seems to be trying to get close to the threshold \\(N\\) but also wants to avoid going over.\n2. Consider our current situation:\n   - Our current total is 25, and the threshold \\(N = 38\\). The difference between our current total and \\(N\\) is \\(38 - 25=13\\).\n   - Since we are still quite far from the threshold, and based on the opponent's history of being aggressive in getting close to the threshold, we have room to take another card. A hit gives us a chance to get closer to 38 without a very high - risk of going over.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. **Current situation**: The current threshold \\(N = 38\\). Our total score is \\(33\\), and there is a difference of \\(38 - 33=5\\) points from the threshold.\n2. **Opponent's situation**: The opponent has a 'Q' (worth \\(12\\) points) and three unknown - cards. They stood on the 3rd turn. In the previous two rounds, the opponent also stood relatively early. This indicates that the opponent may be following a conservative strategy, and it is very likely that their total score is close to \\(38\\) but does not exceed it.\n3. **Risk - reward assessment**:\n    - If we choose to 'Hit', the new card we get may make our total score exceed \\(38\\). For example, if we get a card with a value of \\(6\\) or more (\\(6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K\\)), our total score will exceed \\(38\\). Since the opponent has already stopped, there is a high risk of losing if we exceed \\(38\\).\n    - If we choose to 'Stand', with our current score of \\(33\\), we wait to see the opponent's final score. There is a chance that the opponent's score is either over \\(38\\) or lower than \\(33\\), and we may win.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the better move is to 'Stand'.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the history, the opponent seems to hit a few times before standing.

In most cases, the opponent hits multiple times before standing.\n- Our current total is 12, and the threshold \\(N = 37\\).

Analyze the situation:\n   - The current threshold \\(N = 37\\). Our current card total is 16, which is far from 37.\n   - Looking at the opponent's strategy from the history, in many rounds, the opponent stands relatively early. In the current round, the opponent stood after the second turn. The opponent's visible card is 10, and we don't know the other two cards. But since we are far from the threshold, taking another card (hitting) has a relatively low risk of exceeding 37 at this point.\n   - By hitting, we have a good chance of getting closer to 37 and potentially winning the round.\n2. Format the answer:\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, note the current situation:\n   - The threshold \\(N = 37\\).\n   - Your current card total is \\(27\\).\n   - The opponent has a \\(10\\) and two unknown - cards and has already stood.\n2. Consider the possible range of the opponent's total:\n   - The minimum value of the opponent's total is \\(10 + 2+2=14\\) (assuming the two unknown cards are both \\(2\\)s). The maximum value of the opponent's total is \\(10 + 13+13 = 36\\) (assuming the two unknown cards are both Kings).\n3. Analyze the decision of hitting or standing:\n   - If you stand, your total is \\(27\\). If the opponent's total is less than \\(27\\), you win. If the opponent's total is \\(27\\), it's a draw. If the opponent's total is between \\(28\\) and \\(37\\), you lose.\n   - If you hit, there is a risk of exceeding \\(37\\). But if you can get a card such that your total gets closer to \\(37\\) without exceeding it, you increase your chance of winning.\n   - The expected value of a card from the infinite deck:\n     - The values of cards range from \\(1\\) (Ace) to \\(13\\) (King). The sum of values from \\(1\\) to \\(13\\) is \\(\\sum_{i = 1}^{13}i=\\frac{13\\times(13 + 1)}{2}=91\\). The average value of a card is \\(\\frac{91}{13}=7\\).\n     - If you hit and get a card with a value of \\(7\\), your new total will be \\(27+7 = 34\\), which is closer to \\(37\\) and likely to win against the opponent.\n4. Evaluate the risk - reward:\n   - The risk of hitting is that you may get a card that makes your total exceed \\(37\\). However, since your current total is relatively far from \\(37\\) (a difference of \\(37 - 27=10\\)), and the opponent has already stood, hitting gives you a better chance of getting closer to \\(37\\) and winning the round.\n\nAnswer: Hit","1. Analyze the current situation:\n   - The threshold \\(N = 37\\). Your current card total is 35.\n   - The opponent has a 10 - point card and two unknown cards.

There is still a large gap between our current score and the threshold.\n   - Looking at the opponent's strategy from the history, the opponent often hits multiple times in each round. For example, in many rounds (Round 1, Round 2, Round 4 etc.), the opponent hits until a certain point and then stands.\n   - Since our current score is far from the threshold, it is beneficial for us to try to get closer to the threshold by getting more cards. So, we should choose to hit.\n2. **Answer in the required format**:\nAnswer: Hit","1. **Analysis of the opponent's strategy based on history**:\n   - Looking at the history, in most rounds, the opponent keeps hitting for a certain number of turns and then stands. In rounds where the threshold is around 47 (round 1 and 2), the opponent hits multiple times before standing.\n   - Our current total is 38, and the threshold is 47. We have some room to increase our total. Since the opponent is likely to keep hitting to get closer to the threshold, we should also try to increase our score to be more competitive.\n2. **Decision - Hit**:\n   - By hitting, we have a chance to get closer to the threshold of 47 without exceeding it immediately. If we stand now, with a total of 38, the opponent may get a higher score by continuing to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\nWe know our current total is 40 and the threshold \\(N = 47\\). There is a difference of \\(47 - 40=7\\) between our total and the threshold.\n\nLooking at the opponent's strategy from the history, they seem to be more aggressive in taking cards. They often continue to hit even when we stop in previous rounds. \n\nIf we hit, there is a chance to get closer to 47 and potentially win. The risk is that we might exceed 47 and lose. But considering the opponent's aggressive play, they are likely to get a relatively high - score as well. Since we are 7 points away from the threshold, there is a reasonable chance of getting a card that won't make us exceed 47.\n\nSo, it is a good move to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Since my total score has already exceeded the threshold of 47, no matter what my opponent's final score is, if they don't exceed 47, I lose; if they also exceed 47, it's a draw. In either case, hitting or standing won't change the fact that I can't win. So I should stand.\nAnswer: Stand","Since your total is already 51 which exceeds the threshold of 47, regardless of what the opponent does and what their final total is, if they don't exceed 47, they win; if they also exceed 47, it's a draw. But in any case, hitting more won't improve your situation. So the best move is to stand.\nAnswer: Stand","Since your total card value is already 51 which exceeds the threshold (N = 47), no matter what the opponent's final total is, you will either lose or draw. Hitting another card won't change the situation in a positive way, so the best move is to stand.\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis:\nYou have already exceeded the threshold of 47 (your total is 51). The best - case scenario for you now is a draw. Since you have already gone over the limit, you should not take any more cards. You need to wait and see if the opponent also goes over the threshold. So, the optimal move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Analysis:\n- From the history, we can observe that the opponent often hits multiple times before standing.\n- Our current total is 14, which is quite far from the threshold of 50. We have a lot of room to draw more cards without exceeding the limit easily.\n- So, it is a good idea to request an additional card (Hit) to get closer to the threshold of 50.\n\nAnswer: Hit","1. Analyze the opponent's strategy based on the history:\n   - The opponent often hits multiple times before standing. For example, in Round 1, the opponent hit 4 times before standing; in Round 2, the opponent hit 3 times before standing; in Round 4, the opponent hit 5 times before standing.\n   - Given that the opponent already has a 'Q' (worth 12 points) in the current round and hit in the first turn, it's likely they will continue to try to get closer to the threshold of 50.\n2. Analyze our current situation:\n   - Our current total is 24 with a threshold of 50. We have a lot of room to increase our score without exceeding 50.\n   - Hitting a card has a high - probability of not exceeding 50 at this stage. For example, if we hit an ace (1 point), our total becomes 25; if we hit a 10, our total becomes 34.\n3. Conclusion:\n   - We should hit to try to get closer to the threshold of 50, especially considering the opponent's tendency to build up their score.\n\nAnswer: Hit","First, let's analyze the situation. Our current total is 25 and the threshold N is 50. We are quite far from the threshold.\n\nLooking at the opponent's known card, they have a Queen (worth 12 points). Since we don't know their other three cards, it's hard to accurately predict their total. However, based on the history, the opponent seems to keep hitting until a certain point and then stands.\n\nOur current total is far from the threshold, so taking another card (hitting) has a relatively low risk of exceeding 50. By hitting, we can increase our total to get closer to 50 and potentially beat the opponent.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Looking at the history, the opponent usually hits multiple times before standing. Currently, our total is 37 and the threshold is 50. There is still room to get closer to 50 without exceeding it.\n\nIf we stand now, we have a relatively large gap from 50, and considering the opponent's past behavior of continuing to draw cards, they may get closer to 50 and win. By hitting, we have a chance to increase our score and get closer to 50.\n\nSo, the better move is to hit.\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n- Our current total is 43 with a threshold of 50. There is a gap of 7 points.\n- Looking at the opponent's strategy from the history, the opponent often continues to hit until relatively late in the game. Since we are at 43 and there is still a good margin to the threshold of 50, hitting one more card has a relatively high probability of not exceeding 50 and may get us closer to 50. \n\nAnswer: Hit\nAnswer: Hit","Analysis:\n1. First, calculate our current total. Our current cards are ['7', '7', '10', 'A', 'Q', '6', '4'] with a total of 47, and the threshold \\(N = 50\\).\n2. Then, analyze the opponent's situation. The opponent has a face - up 'Q' (worth 12 points), and we know from previous rounds that the opponent usually stands when their total is close to the threshold. Since the opponent stood this time, it's very likely that their total is already close to 50.\n3. If we hit, there is a high risk of exceeding 50. For example, if we draw a card with a value of 4 or more, we will exceed the threshold.\n4. Given that our current total of 47 is already relatively close to 50, and there is a significant risk of going over the limit by hitting, it is wiser to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
