Therefore, the most prudent move here is to take another card and aim to get closer to 42.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a threshold of 42, drawing one more card cannot cause your current total of 24 to exceed 42 (since the maximum card value is 13, 24 + 13 = 37 < 42). Therefore, you face no risk of busting on the next card and can only improve your total, which currently only ties or beats the opponent’s possible totals (12 to 24). Hence, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","You already have a total of 32 versus the opponent’s total of 11 + unknown (which can be at most 13, for a total of 24). Your total is closer to 42, so drawing another card only risks going over 42. Therefore, the best move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","It is safe to take another card because your total is 24 and the threshold is 38, leaving you a 14-point margin. Even if you draw the highest-value card (13), you will only reach 37, which does not exceed the threshold. Therefore, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Stand\n\nAnswer: Stand","I would request another card at this point, given that 16 is far from 38 and the opponent appears to stand early.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","You currently have 17, well below the threshold of 31, and taking one card will not cause you to exceed 31. Therefore, it is advantageous to draw another card rather than stand on 17.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold of 31 and your current total of 23 versus the opponent’s visible 12 (Q) plus an unknown card, standing offers a higher expected score than hitting:\n\n• If you stand on 23, the opponent’s unknown card can be 1–13, making their total 13–25.  \n  – In 10 out of 13 cases, the opponent’s total is less than 23, so you win.  \n  – In 1 out of 13 cases, the opponent’s total equals 23, so you draw.  \n  – In 2 out of 13 cases, the opponent’s total exceeds 23 (24 or 25), so you lose.  \n  – Overall expected score ≈ 0.81.  \n\n• If you hit, you risk exceeding 31 (busting) with any card ≥ 9 (5 out of 13 chances). Even when you do not bust, your probability of ending up at a winning total is lower overall. The expected score from hitting works out to about 0.60.  \n\nHence, the better move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","With a threshold of 48 and your current total at only 11, you are still very far from exceeding N. Meanwhile, the opponent stands immediately and could have between 4 and 16 (3 plus a possible 1–13). Because you are behind both the likely minimum (4) and maximum (16) totals of your opponent, and given the large threshold of 48, you should continue to draw cards to increase your total closer to N and surpass any likely opponent total without significant risk of busting.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I will take another card (“Hit”). Given that N is 48 and my total is only 13, I am far from exceeding 48, so drawing more cards to approach the threshold is advantageous. The opponent has already stood, most likely having a relatively low total (3 + unknown), so improving my total has a high chance of beating theirs without risking going over 48.\n\nAnswer: Hit","You should stand. With a total of 17 versus the opponent’s maximum possible total of 16 (3 + 13), you are already guaranteed to be closer to 48. Taking another card only introduces unnecessary risk.  \n\nAnswer: Stand","You currently have a total of 15, while your opponent shows an Ace, which is worth 1. Since Aces are always 1 in this variant, the highest your opponent can have face down is a King (worth 13), giving them at most 14 total. Your 15 already exceeds any possible total of theirs, so standing guarantees that you do not bust and remain ahead of their maximum. Therefore, the correct move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","I would choose to draw another card (“Hit”). Our current total is only 9, and with the threshold at 43 and the opponent almost certainly standing with a total that could easily exceed ours, it is too risky to stand so low. By hitting, we can move closer to 43 without a high chance of busting.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Stand. With the opponent’s total guaranteed to be at most 15 (2 + at most 13), your current 21 already beats all possible opponent totals without risking a bust by drawing additional cards.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the opponent’s fixed pattern of always standing immediately, their total will simply be 11 plus whatever their face-down card is (ranging from 1 to 13). With your current total of 21 (well below the threshold of 29), standing offers a higher expected return than hitting:\n\n• If you stand on 21, you beat all opponent totals from 12 to 20, tie if they have 21, and lose if they have 22–24.  \n  – Probability of winning: 9\/13  \n  – Probability of tying: 1\/13  \n  – Probability of losing: 3\/13  \n  – Expected score ≈ 0.73  \n\n• If you hit, there’s a 5\/13 chance of busting (and losing outright). Even if you don’t bust, while totals 25–29 always win, the overall expected score drops to about 0.58 when factoring in bust scenarios.  \n\nTherefore, standing yields the higher expected score.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Hit\n\nAnswer: Hit","You are already at 29, while your opponent’s maximum possible total (11 + up to 13) is 24. Since 29 is closer to 45 than any total your opponent might have, standing guarantees you a win without risking going over the threshold.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Stand\n\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Meanwhile, the opponent is stuck at a lower total (unless the hidden card is exceptionally high, which still would not exceed 26). Therefore, the safer and more advantageous play is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given your current total of 9 against a threshold of 42, it is most prudent to request another card.  \n\nAnswer: Hit","I recommend taking another card. Since N is 42 and your current total is only 11, you have a lot of room before risking going over 42. The opponent has already stood, with a total somewhere between 4 and 16, which is much lower than 42. Hitting will help you move closer to beating the opponent’s total without much risk of busting.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a threshold of 42 and currently holding only 15, there is ample room to safely draw more cards and improve your total, especially since the opponent has already stood with a relatively low-looking total. Therefore, it is advantageous to continue drawing.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a threshold (N) of 42, your total is 18. The opponent's face-up card is 3, and since the opponent has already stood, their maximum possible total (if the hidden card is a King worth 13) would be 16. Your 18 already beats every possible total the opponent can have (4 through 16). Therefore, the best move is to stand to avoid risking a bust.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the opponent's fixed strategy (always standing immediately) and the fact that your 21 already exceeds any possible total the opponent can have (since their visible card is 3, and their face-down card can at most bring them to 16), the correct play is to stand. Hitting risks a bust unnecessarily, while standing guarantees a win.\n\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

There is roughly a 30% chance to draw a card worth 10 or more (which would cause you to exceed 24), and about a 70% chance to draw a safer card. Given the high threshold (24), taking a calculated risk to improve your total by hitting is generally favorable.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the threshold of 24 and your current total of 17 (cards 6, 9, 2), you already exceed any total the opponent could have (they have at most 14, since their Ace is worth 1 and the unknown card can be at most 13). Standing ensures you do not risk busting and guarantees a higher total than the opponent.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given the high threshold (N=49), and the low current total (12), there is little risk in exceeding N with an additional card. Drawing another card (Hit) allows the possibility to improve your total substantially without significant risk of busting right now. Therefore, the best move at this point is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the threshold of 49, our total of 14 is far from exceeding 49, and the opponent has stood with a visible K (13) plus an unknown card. Since we can safely take more cards without busting, it’s advantageous to keep hitting to surpass their likely total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the very high threshold of 49, and considering you only have a total of 18, there is ample room to attempt to improve your total without exceeding 49. The logical move here is to continue drawing cards (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a threshold of 49, having a total of only 23 leaves you with plenty of room to draw without risking an immediate bust. Even if you draw high-value cards (e.g., face cards worth 11–13 points), you can still stay under or around 49 and only decide to stand once you are closer to that threshold. Therefore, continuing to Hit is the logical choice.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on a threshold (N) of 49, your total of 35 cannot bust on the next draw (the largest possible card is worth 13, which would bring you to 48). Therefore, it is advantageous to take an additional card to try to improve your total.  \n\nAnswer: Hit","Stand is the best move. With a total of 47 against the opponent’s likely much lower total (they have shown a face-up King (13) plus one unknown card, and they have already stood repeatedly), you are almost certainly closer to 49. Hitting has a high probability (10\/13) of busting you. Therefore, you should stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Hit\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current totals, your hand is already substantially higher (29) than the opponent’s possible total (2 + an unknown card that can be at most 13, yielding 15). Since neither side is near the threshold (47), staying at 29 easily beats any total the opponent can have (up to 15) without risking a bust. Therefore, the best move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","With a threshold of 39 and your total currently at 21, you still have considerable room to draw without exceeding 39. Since getting closer to 39 can improve your chances of beating the opponent, the best move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the rules, your total of 22 already exceeds the opponent’s maximum possible total of 20 (7 + at most 13). Since you are both below the threshold of 39, and your total (22) will beat any possible total the opponent has (8–20), the best move is to stand rather than risk drawing further cards and possibly busting.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the threshold of 25 and your current total of 18 versus the opponent’s likely total (ranging up to 14), standing is optimal to avoid the high risk of busting. \n\nAnswer: Stand","Hit. Given your current total (22) is far from the threshold (48), you can safely draw another card without exceeding N in most cases, aiming to improve your position before standing.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the opponent’s revealed 10 (with an unknown face-down card worth at most 13), their highest possible total is 23. Your current total is 27. Since 27 already beats any total the opponent could have (and the opponent is not drawing any more cards), the safest and best move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Hit\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold of 35 and your current total of 20, drawing one more card cannot exceed 35 because the highest possible single-card value is 13 (King). Therefore, you face no risk of busting on the next draw. Hitting will improve your chances of getting closer to 35 and outscoring your opponent.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 33 (only 2 points under the threshold of 35) and the high likelihood of busting if you take another card (you only remain safe if you draw an Ace or 2, which is a 2\/13 chance), the optimal move is to Stand. This also puts you closer to 35 than your opponent, who appears to have at most 16.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the threshold of 31 and your current total of 10, you have plenty of room before approaching 31. It is generally advantageous to continue drawing cards rather than stand on a low total. Therefore, the best move at this point is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Stand\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the high threshold (41) and your current total of 19, you cannot bust on your next draw (since the maximum single-card value is 13, bringing you at most to 32).

Taking another card offers no benefit because you cannot improve your winning position against a capped 23, and any additional draws introduce a risk (even if only on subsequent cards) of exceeding 41 in later hits. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to Stand immediately.\n\nAnswer: Stand","You currently have a total of 13, which is far below the threshold of 46. Given that there is ample room before exceeding 46, it makes sense to take at least one more card to improve your total. Therefore, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a threshold (N) of 46 and your current total at only 19, you are still far from exceeding N. Since your opponent has already chosen to stand (with a range of 8 to 20, depending on the hidden card’s value), the optimal approach is to continue drawing cards to move closer to 46. Therefore, you should Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","You are already at 24 total with a threshold of 46, while your opponent stands at a range of 8–20. Because 24 is closer to 46 than any total between 8 and 20, you are guaranteed to win by standing (as long as you do not exceed 46).

Hitting gives you more room to reach closer to 35 without going over.\n\nAnswer: Hit","You currently have a total of 29, and since the opponent has stood, their maximum possible total is 26 (13 + 13). Standing at 29 guarantees winning against any total the opponent could have. Therefore, the best move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Hit\n\nAnswer: Hit","On Turn 2, facing a threshold (N) of 27 and holding a total of 20 versus the opponent’s face-up 5 (who has already stood), you are already ahead of any likely total the opponent has. Drawing another card carries a considerable risk of busting (> 40% chance to pick up 8 or higher). Since you are almost certainly beating the opponent’s total (they likely have 15–18), the best strategy here is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the threshold of 32 and the opponent’s apparent “always stand” strategy, we can compare two main options: standing on 21 or taking a hit.\n\n1) If we stand on 21:  \n   • The opponent’s visible card is J (11), plus an unknown card (1–13).  \n   • That makes the opponent’s total 11 + x, where x ∈ {1, 2, …, 13}.  \n   • Our distance from 32 is 11; the opponent’s distance from 32 is (32 – (11 + x)) = 21 – x.  \n   • Checking all x from 1 to 13, we win if x ≤ 9, tie if x = 10, lose if x ≥ 11.  \n   • Probability of winning = 9\/13, tying = 1\/13, losing = 3\/13 → expected score ≈ 0.7307.  \n\n2) If we hit:  \n   • We add a random card y ∈ {1, 2, …, 13} to our total of 21.  \n   • Bust occurs if y > 11 (i.e., y = 12 or 13), with probability 2\/13 → score = 0.  \n   • Otherwise, our total is 21 + y ∈ {22, 23, …, 32}, and the opponent remains at 11 + x.  \n   • For each possible 21 + y in [22..32], we can calculate how often we beat (or tie\/lose to) the opponent’s 11 + x. Once done, the resulting average expected score turns out to be about 0.8195, which is higher than the 0.7307 from standing.  \n\nTherefore, hitting yields a higher expected score than standing when the threshold is 32 and you already have 21 against an opponent who stands immediately.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Stand.\n\nReasoning:  \n• Your current total is 24 (8 + 13 + 3), and the threshold is N = 32.  \n• The opponent’s visible card is a J (11), and their unknown card can range from 1 to 13, so their total is between 12 and 24.  \n• By standing on 24, you either beat all opponent totals of 23 or below or tie if the opponent also has 24. That yields a favorable expected outcome.  \n• Hitting risks drawing 9 or higher (9, 10, J, Q, K) which immediately busts (probability 5\/13), making standing the better choice.  \n\nAnswer: Stand","I recommend standing immediately. Since the opponent always stands and their total can be at most 16 (3 + K=13), your current total of 19 already beats any possible opponent total without risking a bust.\n\nAnswer: Stand","I would request another card because my total of 16 is too far from 39, and the opponent is likely to have more than 16 with their unknown card. Hitting gives me a better chance to get closer to 39 without busting.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold of 39, having a total of 17 leaves a large safe margin to draw additional cards without exceeding 39. Therefore, a prudent move here is to request another card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","You are already ahead of your opponent’s likely total (they can have at most 19). Since you have 26 and the opponent has stood, you will win by standing (no need to risk drawing another card).\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the threshold of 40 and your current total of 10, it is very safe to take another card. The opponent’s known face-up card is a K (worth 13), and they tend to stand immediately, so you will likely want to build a higher total without much risk of exceeding 40. Therefore, the best move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold of 40, having a total of 21 is still relatively low. The opponent’s maximum possible total with two cards is 26 (if their unknown card is a K), which is closer to 40 than 21. Therefore, if you stand now, you would lose whenever their total is 22 to 26.\n\nHowever, because N = 40, drawing another card from 21 cannot immediately make you exceed 40: the highest single‐card value is 13 (K), which would bring you to 34. As soon as you reach any total ≥ 27, you will beat the opponent’s best possible total of 26. Thus, you can safely continue to Hit until you reach at least 27 and then Stand, guaranteeing you will be closer to 40 than the opponent. Consequently, the optimal move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Hit (there is no chance to exceed 40 with just one additional card, so it’s best to draw and try to improve your total)\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold of 40, your current total of 26 cannot be exceeded by one additional card (the highest-value card is 13, and 26 + 13 = 39 < 40). Because the opponent’s maximum possible total with two cards (K plus another) is 26, drawing one more card guarantees that you will exceed their total without busting. Therefore, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given your current total of 36 and the threshold of 40, hitting risks a high chance of busting (drawing 5 or higher will exceed 40). Meanwhile, the opponent has shown a tendency to stand without drawing additional cards. With your total at 36, you’re likely ahead of the opponent’s unknown total (which can range from 14 to 26 if the hidden card is between Ace (1) and King (13)). Therefore, the optimal move is to stand and avoid the significant bust risk of hitting.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the threshold of 33 and your current total of only 7, it is most advantageous to draw additional cards to try to get closer to 33 without exceeding it. Therefore, the best move at this point is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Hit\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold (N = 33) and your current total (20), drawing one more card cannot cause you to exceed 33 (even if the card is a King worth 13, you will reach exactly 33). Therefore, you should continue drawing at least one more card to improve your total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Stand\n\nExplanation:\n\nWe currently have a total of 24 (A=1 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 4 = 24), and the dealer shows K (13) plus an unknown card worth 1–13 points. The dealer’s final total is thus 14–26 (13 + 1 through 13 + 13).\n\n• If we STAND at 24:\n  – The dealer’s total is uniformly distributed between 14 and 26.\n  – We beat totals of 14–23 (10 outcomes), tie against 24 (1 outcome), and lose to 25–26 (2 outcomes).\n  – Expected score = (10\/13)*1 + (1\/13)*0.5 + (2\/13)*0 = 10.5\/13 = 21\/26 ≈ 0.8077.\n\n• If we HIT:\n  – We draw a card worth 1–13 points.\n  – Drawing 10–13 (4\/13 chance) yields a total > 33 (bust) ⇒ 0 score.\n  – Drawing 1–9 (9\/13 chance) yields a total of 25–33, which always beats or ties any 14–26 the dealer might have. The expected value in these cases is generally good, but upon summing over all possible extra-card values 1–13, the total expected score is ≈ 0.6805.\n  – Hence, hitting produces a lower overall expectation than standing.\n\nBecause 0.8077 (stand) > 0.6805 (hit), the best move is to STAND.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current threshold (N=24) and your hand total of 9, you have substantial room to improve your total without exceeding 24. Consequently, the most prudent move is to request an additional card to aim for a total closer to 24.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold (N=24) and your current total of 13, standing is very likely to lose against the dealer’s unknown second card (they show a Jack, worth 11, so their total could easily exceed 13). Hitting gives you a solid chance to reach a total closer to 24 without busting immediately. Therefore, the best move in this situation is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your cards (Q+3=15) and the threshold of 34, you have a relatively low total. It is generally advantageous to take another card and try to improve your total without going over the threshold. Therefore, you should Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Stand\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the history, your opponent always stands immediately, so they will likely remain at whatever they have. Because the threshold is high (45) and your current total is only 14, you should continue to draw cards until your total is much closer to 45 (or you sense a high risk of busting). Thus, the best first move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the threshold of 45, your total is 26 while the opponent’s maximum possible total with a single unknown card is 19 (6 + up to 13). Since 26 already beats any possible total of the opponent and you are safe under 45, standing is the best move to guarantee a higher total without risking a bust.\n\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

You still have ample room to draw additional cards without risking an immediate bust, and standing at 18 puts you at a significant disadvantage against an opponent who can continue to draw toward a much higher total. Therefore, it’s advantageous to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the rules and the current total of 29 (well below the threshold of 42), drawing one more card cannot cause a bust, since the highest-value card (K = 13) would bring the total to exactly 42. Taking an additional card provides an opportunity to increase the total and secure a win against the opponent’s likely lower total (3 plus an unknown card, maximum 16). Therefore, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given your current total of 40 and the threshold of 42, drawing another card is very risky (you would bust on any draw other than an Ace or a 2). Meanwhile, your opponent has already stood with a visible 3 and an unknown card, which can at most bring them to 16 (3 + K=13). Standing at 40 guarantees you are closer to 42 than your opponent’s possible maximum of 16, so the best move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Hit. Because the threshold is 32 and your current total is 22, you have room to safely draw another card. Although there is a risk of drawing a Jack, Queen, or King (causing a bust), there are 10 other card values (Ace through 10) that would improve your total without busting. Standing on 22 would likely be too low to beat the opponent if they continue drawing.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 24 versus the opponent’s face-up card (Q = 12) plus an unknown card, standing yields a higher chance of ending closest to 32 (or tying) than hitting. Drawing another card risks exceeding 32 with a substantial probability, which lowers your expected outcome. Therefore, the best move in this situation is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","It’s still early in the round with a low total (9) compared to the high threshold (40). Since the opponent always stands immediately, we have plenty of room to draw additional cards without much risk of busting right away. Standing on 9 would almost certainly lose to any reasonable hidden card value for the opponent. Thus, the best option here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Stand.

Therefore, the optimal move here is to take another card to improve your total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold of 49 and the opponent’s maximum possible total of 21 (8 + a maximum 13), you can safely continue hitting until you reach at least 22.

Since 9 is far from 30, the risk of busting immediately is extremely low. The most appropriate move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I will continue drawing a card.  \nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current totals, standing at 23 yields a higher expected score than taking another hit. Therefore, the best move here is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the threshold of 28 and your current total of 14, it is safe to take another card because even the highest-value card (K = 13) would bring your total to 27, which is still below 28. Standing at 14 would very likely result in a lower total than the opponent’s final total (13 + unknown), which can be up to 26 and would beat your 14. Therefore, the optimal move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on a threshold of 28, having a total of 17 leaves a large gap (11 points) before busting. Since only drawing a Q (12) or K (13) would take you over 28 (29 or 30, respectively), there’s a relatively small chance (~15%) of busting on the next card. Meanwhile, standing on 17 gives the opponent a strong likelihood of beating your total with an unknown face-down card. Therefore, it’s statistically favorable to take at least one more card (“Hit”) and then stand if you don’t bust.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the opponent’s consistent strategy of standing immediately, their final total will be 9 plus whatever their face-down card is (anywhere from 1 to 13), giving them a total in the range 10–22. Because our total is currently only 12 and well below the threshold of 27, standing now would likely lose against most of the opponent’s possible totals. Therefore, it is advantageous to take at least one more card to increase our total without exceeding 27.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the opponent’s consistent behavior (always standing on their two‐card total) and your current total of 18 versus the threshold of 27, the expected value calculation suggests that standing yields a slightly higher expected score than hitting. Therefore, the best move here is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","With the threshold at 45 and your current total at only 6, it is extremely unlikely you will exceed 45 by drawing another card. Since your opponent consistently stands immediately and you have ample room to improve your total without going bust, the best move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the threshold (N) is 45 and your current total is only 17, there is a large margin before you risk exceeding 45. Drawing another card will likely improve your total without busting. Standing at 17 is quite low compared to 45, and the opponent has already stood. Therefore, the stronger move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold of 45 and your current total of 21, there is no risk of exceeding 45 with a single draw (the highest possible card value is 13). Meanwhile, the opponent seems to always stand early. You have ample room to improve your total without busting, so you should continue to draw in an effort to get closer to 45.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 28 and the high threshold of 45, drawing one more card cannot cause you to exceed 45 (since the largest card value is 13, bringing your total at most to 41). Thus, it is safer to continue drawing and aim closer to 45 rather than stand at 28.\n\nAnswer: Hit","You hold 40, while your opponent—who has already stood—can only have 4–16 total (3 plus a face-down card of 1–13). You are already comfortably ahead without exceeding the threshold of 45. Drawing another card carries a high risk of busting (since 6 or higher would push you over 45), and standing guarantees beating your opponent’s total. Therefore, the advisable move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","With a threshold of 46 and holding only 18, there is plenty of room to safely draw more cards without exceeding 46. Since the opponent has shown a consistent pattern of standing immediately, continuing to draw gives you the best chance to surpass the opponent’s total. Therefore, the best move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","You currently have 23 points, while the opponent’s maximum possible total (9 + K=13) is 22. Because they always stand, you are already ahead of every possible opponent total. Since drawing even one card cannot make you exceed 46 (23 + max 13 = 36), you could safely Hit and then Stand. However, it is simplest to Stand immediately because you are already guaranteed to beat the opponent’s total.\n\nAnswer: stand","I will stand because my total (19) already exceeds the opponent's maximum possible total (17), and thus I am guaranteed to be closer to 40 than they are.\n\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Since the opponent has chosen to stand, you have no need to take further risks.

Therefore, the best next move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","It is safe to take another card because even the highest-value card (K = 13) would only bring your total to 38, which is still below the threshold of 41. Therefore, hitting is the most advantageous move.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I have 29, which is significantly below the threshold of 41. The risk of drawing a King (worth 13) is only 1\/13, and all other draws will keep me within or at 41. Since 29 is relatively far from 41, it is statistically favorable to attempt another draw rather than stand on 29.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your total of 37 and the threshold of 41, hitting carries a high risk of busting (you have only four points of safe “space”). With an approximate 70% chance of drawing a card worth 5 or more and busting immediately, it is generally better to stand and force your opponent to risk catching up without going over 41.\n\nAnswer: Stand","I would continue drawing cards because 13 is still far from reaching the threshold of 42. Hitting now gives a good chance to improve the total without exceeding 42.  \n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 16 against a threshold of 42, it is still quite safe to take another card. You are far from exceeding 42, and a single card draw is very unlikely to push your total over the threshold. Therefore, the best move here is to continue with a Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 25 and the threshold of 42, taking another card cannot bust you this turn (because the highest-value card is 13, which would bring you to 38). Therefore, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 35 and the threshold of 42, taking another card gives you a reasonable chance to improve your total without going over, since drawing a 7 or less will keep you under or at the threshold. Standing at 35 leaves you relatively far from 42, and the opponent could surpass that total. Therefore, the recommended move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Stand\n\nAnswer: Stand","With a total of 8 against a threshold of 27, it is almost always better to draw at least one more card and attempt to improve your total. Standing at 8 would yield a very low chance of winning because the opponent could easily surpass your total. Therefore, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on a typical risk assessment for this threshold (N = 27), drawing an additional card from 21 has a higher than 50% chance of busting. Therefore, it is generally advantageous to stand to avoid exceeding 27. \n\nAnswer: Stand","Hit\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a threshold of 45 and a current total of only 11, it is usually advantageous to draw more cards to get closer to 45 without exceeding it. Therefore, I would choose to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that the threshold is 45 and your current total is only 17, there is still ample room to safely draw more cards. Standing at 17 would be extremely conservative and likely disadvantageous, as the opponent could easily surpass that total without busting. Therefore, the recommended move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Hit. You currently have 22, which is still far from the threshold of 45. Even with the highest-value card (13) added, you would be at 35, well under 45. Hitting again allows you to move closer to the threshold without an immediate risk of exceeding it.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a threshold of 45 and your current total at 32, you can safely draw at least one more card without risking an immediate bust (since even the highest-value card, K = 13, would bring you exactly to 45). It is generally advantageous to try to get closer to the threshold than the opponent, so the recommended move here is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total (37) and the threshold (N = 45), there is still room to improve your hand. While drawing another card carries the risk of exceeding 45 (a roughly 38% chance of busting if you draw 9 or higher), standing on 37 is likely too low given your opponent will continue to draw. Hitting provides an opportunity to reach a stronger total that can outscore your opponent.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a threshold of 43 and a current total of only 10, it is very unlikely that taking more cards will push you over the threshold, whereas standing at 10 gives the dealer a good chance to outscore you without busting. Therefore, the best move at this point is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 17 versus a threshold of 43, it is generally advantageous to draw additional cards rather than stand, because 17 is still quite far from 43. The risk of busting with a single card is low, and you can still safely attempt to improve your total. Therefore, the recommended move here is: Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","You should continue to draw another card (Hit). Because the threshold is 43 and your current total is 28, there is no risk of busting on the next card (the highest card value is 13, which would only bring you up to 41).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 39 (with a threshold of 43), hitting carries a high risk of going over 43. The probability of drawing a card of value 5 or higher (which would bust you) is 9\/13, making it unfavorable to hit. Therefore, standing at 39 is the more prudent choice.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given a threshold of 40 and a current total of 22, it is safe to hit at least once because drawing any single card cannot exceed 40 (the highest card is worth 13, which would bring the total to 35). Therefore, the best move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","You currently have a total of 29, which is 11 points below the threshold of 40. In this variant, face cards J, Q, K are worth 11, 12, and 13 points respectively. Therefore, the only draws that would immediately bust you are Q (+12, total 41) or K (+13, total 42). With an infinite deck and uniform distribution, there is a relatively small risk (2 out of 13 ranks) of exceeding 40. Meanwhile, standing with 29 leaves substantial room for the opponent to surpass your total without busting.\n\nGiven these considerations, it is generally advantageous to take another card to try reaching closer to 40.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I will stand, because at a total of 37, the risk of busting is very high if I draw another card.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the threshold of 31 and your current total of 22, there is a relatively favorable chance (9 out of 13 possible card ranks) of drawing a card that will not exceed 31. Standing on 22 allows the opponent ample room to surpass your total, so hitting appears to be the better strategy.\n\nAnswer: hit","Hit\n\nAnswer: Hit","You currently have a total of 17, and since the threshold is 32, you cannot bust with a single draw (the highest-value card is 13, which would take you to 30). Therefore, it is advantageous to request another card to try to get closer to 32.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Stand\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the threshold of 31 and your current total of 15, there is significant room to safely draw additional cards to get closer to 31 without immediately risking a bust. Therefore, the more advantageous move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the threshold of 31 and a current total of 21, it is generally advantageous to continue drawing. Although there is a risk of busting if you draw a J, Q, or K (roughly a 23% chance), the likelihood (about 77%) is that you will improve your total without exceeding 31. Since 21 is relatively low in a game aiming for 31, increasing your total can put you in a stronger position against your opponent, who currently shows a 7 and is likely to continue drawing.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 27, drawing another card risks a high probability of exceeding 31 (since any card of 5 or higher would cause a bust). Standing now gives a reasonable chance to win or draw, especially given the history of the opponent’s tendency to stand at modest totals or potentially bust on further hits. Therefore, the most prudent move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on your current total of 11 and the high threshold of 40, it is generally advisable to request an additional card (Hit), as there is a large margin before you risk exceeding N. Standing now would leave you at a relatively low total, giving your opponent a substantial opportunity to surpass your total without exceeding N.\n\nAnswer: Hit","You should continue to draw cards. You are currently at 16 with a threshold of 40, which gives you enough room to safely “Hit” and try to improve your total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Hit. From a total of 22 with the threshold at 40, there is no risk of busting on the next draw because the highest-value card (K = 13) would only bring your total to 35, which is still below 40.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold of 40 and your current total of 32, the likelihood of busting with another hit is almost 40%, whereas there is a strong chance the opponent is already over 40 (busted) given that they are holding five cards including a K. Standing maximizes your probability of winning here by capitalizing on the possibility that the opponent has exceeded the threshold.\n\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Meanwhile, drawing almost any other card will bring you closer to 26 without going over. Therefore, it is advantageous to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 24, taking another card is highly risky since only drawing an Ace (value 1) or a 2 would avoid going over 26. That yields very low odds of improving the total without busting. The stronger play is to stop drawing and hope the opponent eventually exceeds 26 or ends up with a total lower than yours. Therefore, the optimal move here is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","You currently have a total of 9 while the threshold is 24.

Consequently, the better option is to continue drawing.\n\nAnswer: hit","Given your current total of 19 and a threshold of 24, hitting carries a high risk of busting (probability 8\/13). Standing is therefore the safer choice, as you already hold a strong total.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the threshold of 35 and your current total of 14, you have ample room to draw more cards without immediately risking a bust. Therefore, the optimal move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I would take another card (“hit”). At 25, with a threshold of 35, there is still substantial room to improve the hand without busting, and standing at 25 leaves a good chance the opponent could surpass us without going over 35.\n\nAnswer: hit","Based on your current total of 34, drawing almost any card (other than an Ace worth 1) would cause you to exceed the threshold of 35 and lose if the opponent remains below 35. With only a 1\/13 chance to draw an Ace, hitting again is statistically too risky. Therefore, the recommended move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the rules and your current total of 34 (with N = 35), taking another card would risk a near-certain bust (only an Ace, worth 1 point, would keep you in the game). Therefore, your best move is to stand and hope that your opponent’s final total either exceeds 35 or falls short of your 34.\n\nAnswer: Stand","With a total of 34 and a threshold of 35, drawing another card carries a high risk of exceeding 35 (12 out of 13 possible cards would bust). It is therefore best to stand and rely on the opponent potentially busting or remaining below 34.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the high threshold (N = 42) and your current total of 14, it is generally advantageous to take additional cards. Having only 14 leaves considerable room before exceeding 42. Hitting now gives you more flexibility to improve your total while staying under the threshold.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold (N = 42) and your current total of 23, you cannot exceed 42 with just one additional card because the maximum card value is 13 (K). Therefore, you can safely take another card without risking an immediate bust. Hitting again is the recommended move.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Hit\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a total of 36 and a threshold of 42, drawing another card has a greater than 50% chance of causing a bust (any draw of 7 or higher will exceed 42). Given the opponent’s past behavior of aggressive hitting (rounds 1–3 all ended with the opponent busting), standing on 36 is likely the safer choice.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the threshold of 42 and your current total of 36, taking another card risks busting more than 50% of the time (since any card of value 7 or higher would push you over 42). Given the opponent has already taken multiple hits and may also risk exceeding 42, standing on 36 is prudent to maximize your chances of winning (or at least forcing a draw if the opponent also busts).\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the high threshold of 45 and your current total of 19, there is still a large margin before exceeding the threshold. It is generally advantageous to continue drawing additional cards to increase your total closer to 45. Therefore, the recommended move here is to “Hit.”\n\nAnswer: Hit","I would continue drawing cards because 20 is still quite far from 45, giving plenty of room to improve the total without risking an immediate bust. Therefore, my move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the pattern so far, your opponent tends to keep drawing until they exceed the threshold. With N = 45 and your current total at 25, you still have substantial room before reaching 45. Standing at only 25 would risk losing if your opponent managed to draw to, say, 30–44 without busting. A safer approach is to continue drawing and aim for a total closer to 45 before standing. Therefore, the recommended move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: hit","Based on the current total of 27 against a threshold of 45, you still have a considerable margin before risking a bust. Drawing an additional card is unlikely to push you over 45 in one go, and it can bring your total closer to 45, improving your chances of winning. Therefore, the best move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I would stand here. My total of 37 is already reasonably close to the threshold of 45. From the history, the opponent tends to continue hitting and often busts. Taking another card carries a significant bust risk (any 9 or higher busts me), so standing is safer.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on your current total of 9 versus a threshold of 28, it is generally favorable to take another card to try to improve your total without exceeding 28. Therefore, your best move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a total of 22 against a threshold of 28, and given the opponent’s tendency to keep hitting until they exceed the threshold, the safest strategy here is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Stand\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the rules, once you have chosen to stand, you no longer draw additional cards. Since you stood on Turn 1, you have no further actions to take. It is now the opponent’s turn to continue hitting or stand according to their strategy. Your final move remains “Stand.”\n\nAnswer: Stand","I will stand. The opponent has consistently overdrawn in past rounds, so holding at 18 is likely to be the safest choice.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the threshold of 26, you currently have a total of 17 (4 + K=13) with 9 points of \"safe\" room before busting. Drawing any 10, J, Q, or K (all ≥10 in value) causes an immediate bust. Observing your opponent's past tendency to continue hitting aggressively—and frequently bust—stopping at 17 is relatively strong. Standing now forces your opponent to risk drawing multiple cards in order to beat 17, increasing their chance of surpassing 26 and busting.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the pattern in past rounds, your opponent has consistently busted by continuing to draw well past the threshold. Since you already have 17 against a threshold of 26 and the opponent has shown a tendency to keep hitting, standing now is a strong choice: it forces the opponent to draw more cards and increases the likelihood they will exceed 26 and lose. \n\nAnswer: Stand","You have a total of 7 versus a high threshold of 45. It is generally best to draw more cards when you are far below the threshold, aiming to get closer without busting. Therefore, the recommended move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Stand\n\nAnswer: Stand","You have already chosen to Stand on Turn 2, which means you cannot take any further actions. Once a player Stands, they no longer draw cards for the remainder of the round. At this point, only your opponent’s actions will determine whether they exceed the threshold (N = 45) or stop before doing so. Given the opponent’s past behavior (tending to draw until they bust), remaining on 15 and letting your opponent continue is a sound strategy.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the pattern of previous rounds, your opponent consistently hits enough times to exceed the threshold, giving you the win when you stand on a moderate total. Although 15 is quite low relative to N=45, the safest approach is to continue standing and let the opponent risk busting. \n\nAnswer: Stand","Given the current situation (threshold = 45, your total = 15, opponent still drawing, and your consistent success so far by letting the opponent bust), continuing to stand is a solid choice. You have already stood since Turn 2, so there is no further action required on your part. Standing on 15 forces the opponent to keep hitting to reach or beat your total safely, and from the historical pattern, they have a high tendency to exceed the threshold. Therefore, your best move is to continue standing.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the opponent’s past behavior, they tend to keep drawing cards until they exceed the threshold. They have busted in every previous round. With a high threshold of 46, there is still ample room for them to continue drawing, which raises the likelihood of them busting yet again. Your current total of 19 is reasonably safe, and standing forces the opponent into a situation where they will likely continue hitting. Given the consistent pattern that they eventually exceed the threshold, standing here maximizes your chances of winning.\n\nAnswer: Stand","With a threshold (N) of 46 and a total of 19, standing is the most prudent choice. Your opponent, following their established pattern of aggressive hitting, is very likely to draw additional cards and exceed 46. Since you have already stood (as shown in Turn 1), you would not change that move now. You have a solid total of 19, and the opponent’s repeated tendency to bust when trying to reach such a high threshold strongly suggests you will win this round.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the opponent’s consistent pattern of over-hitting and busting in all previous rounds, and given that your current total of 19 is still well below the threshold of 46, the safest and most effective strategy is to continue standing. You are in a favorable position, as the opponent has repeatedly shown a tendency to draw too many cards and exceed the threshold.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given the threshold of 46, one might consider drawing additional cards since 19 is relatively far below 46. However, looking at the opponent’s history across all previous rounds, they have overdrawn (exceeded N) every single time. Since you already have 19, it is a safe and effective strategy to continue standing and allow the opponent to draw further, as the opponent is very likely to bust again based on past performance. Therefore, you should stand and let them continue to hit.\n\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Therefore, the best move here is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I recommend drawing another card. Although 21 is a decent total, the threshold of 28 is relatively high, and there is a good chance the opponent will continue drawing and surpass 21 without busting. Despite the roughly 46% chance of drawing an 8 or higher (which would bust you at 29 or more), standing on 21 often will not be enough to beat a determined opponent aiming for a total closer to 28. Thus, “Hit” is the more aggressive and potentially rewarding choice.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 11 (well below the threshold of 33), you should request an additional card to attempt to increase your total without exceeding 33.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the threshold of 33 and your current total of 24, you still have a reasonable margin before exceeding 33. Statistically, there is a good chance (9 out of 13) that your next card will keep your total at or below 33. Standing at 24 would likely leave you behind, so the recommended move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current threshold (N = 33) and your total of 31, drawing almost any card (3 or higher) would cause you to exceed 33 and lose outright unless your opponent also busts (which is not a strong likelihood to rely upon). The probability of safely drawing an Ace (value 1) or a 2 (value 2) from an infinite deck is only 2\/13, or about 15.4%. Hence, standing at 31 provides the better chance to win or at least draw.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current total (11) and the threshold (N=40), it is very safe to take another card. The opponent’s visible card (9) is of moderate value, and since you are far from 40, drawing further should help you approach the threshold without exceeding it. Therefore, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total (19) and the threshold (40), you still have ample room before risking a bust. Hitting again is a reasonable move to try to get closer to 40. Therefore, the recommended action here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Hit\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total (34) and the threshold (40), drawing another card carries a significant risk of busting (just over half the time). Meanwhile, the opponent, as seen in previous rounds, often draws aggressively and busts fairly frequently. Standing on 34 is likely your best move.  \n\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

With an infinite deck including 13 equally likely ranks (A=1, 2–10, J=11, Q=12, K=13), you would bust on any draw of 6 or higher (which occurs 8 out of 13 times, or about 61.5%). Although your opponent’s final total is unknown, standing on 23 avoids the immediate risk of busting. Balancing the risk of losing outright versus potentially improving your hand by only a small increment, standing is typically the safer choice here.\n\nAnswer: Stand","With a threshold of 38 and a current total of only 12, it is generally advantageous to continue drawing cards to improve your total closer to 38. Therefore, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a high threshold (N=38) and your current total at 18, there is no risk of busting with only one additional card (the maximum single card value is 13, which would take you to at most 31). Therefore, it is generally beneficial to continue drawing to move closer to 38 rather than standing on 18.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a threshold (N) of 38, holding a total of 20 means you cannot exceed 38 with a single card draw (the highest card value is 13 for a King, which would bring you to 33). It is therefore safe and advantageous to hit in order to increase your total closer to 38 without risking an immediate bust.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the threshold of 38, standing on 29 is relatively low. Although there is a risk of drawing a 10 or higher (which would immediately bust you), the probability of getting a 1–9 is 9\/13, making it more likely that you can improve your total and challenge the opponent’s likely higher total. Therefore, the recommended move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 35 vs. a threshold of 38, taking another card has a high risk of busting (since most cards would add 4 or more). Therefore, it is generally safer to stand and hope the opponent’s total does not exceed yours. \n\nAnswer: Stand","I would certainly take another card here. With a total of 8 versus an opponent who is very likely to take at least one card, you have plenty of room to draw without busting under the threshold of 39. Taking a hit gives you a better chance to improve your total and ultimately beat or match the opponent's likely higher total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given your current total of 10 (well below the threshold of 39), it is generally advantageous to draw additional cards in the hope of building a stronger total closer to 39. Thus, the best move here is to continue with another Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the high threshold (N = 39), having a total of only 18 leaves substantial room to draw further cards without immediately risking a bust. Because the opponent already has multiple unknown cards, it's likely they may improve their total further. Continuing to Hit now seems reasonable to aim for a stronger total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 29 against a threshold of 39, there is still room to draw without an overwhelmingly high chance of busting (you would only bust immediately if you draw a J, Q, or K, which is 3 out of 13 possible ranks in an infinite deck). Since the difference between 29 and 39 is 10 points, and there is a good chance (10 out of 13) to draw a card worth between 1 and 10 and improve your total, it is generally advantageous to continue hitting rather than stand on 29.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I recommend standing at 34. With a threshold of 39, drawing another card carries a high risk of exceeding 39 (you bust if you draw 6 or higher). While 34 is not extremely close to 39, the probability of getting a safe card (5 or below) is only 5 out of 13, making it more likely that you would bust than improve your position. Therefore, standing is the safer move here.\n\nAnswer: Stand","With a total of 11 and a threshold of 33, it is generally advantageous to request another card to maximize the likelihood of getting closer to 33 without busting. Therefore, the recommended move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","You currently have a total of 15, and the threshold is 33. Given that 15 is still far from 33 and leaves ample room to draw without exceeding the threshold, the statistically reasonable decision is to take another card. \n\nAnswer: Hit","With a threshold of 33 and your current total at 22, you still have room to draw an additional card without a high bust probability. Standing on 22 risks losing if the opponent surpasses that total. Therefore, the stronger play is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 33, taking another card would exceed the threshold of 33 and guarantee a loss if your opponent does not also exceed 33. Therefore, the best move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","You have already reached the threshold (33) and chosen to stand on Turn 4. Taking another card would exceed the threshold and cause a guaranteed loss. Therefore, no further action is possible or advisable.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the threshold of 43 and your current total of 22, you are still far from exceeding N. Even if you draw the highest-value card (K=13), your new total would be 35, which remains below 43. Therefore, it is safe and prudent to draw another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Hit\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the threshold of 43 and a current total of 33, it is generally advantageous to draw again. There is a 10\/13 chance (≈77%) that the next card will be valued 10 or below, keeping you at or below 43. Standing at 33 would likely allow the opponent (currently showing 5, with unknown additional cards) to surpass your total with further hits. Therefore, the recommended move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I would stand, because drawing another card has a very high chance of exceeding 43 (only Ace or 2 would keep me below or at 43, which is 2\/13 ≈ 15% probability). With 41, I am already quite close to 43, so the safer strategy is to stand and hope the opponent busts or remains below my total.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Since the threshold is relatively high (35) and your current total is only 11, the risk of busting on your next draw is quite low. Hitting allows you to build a stronger total closer to 35, which should improve your chances of winning. Therefore, you should choose to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold (N = 35), having only a total of 17 suggests there is ample room to draw additional cards without risking an immediate bust. Since face cards range up to 13 points and even a 13-point card would bring your total to 30 (still under 35), hitting here offers a good chance to approach N more closely or force the opponent into a more dangerous draw scenario.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 30 and the high risk of busting (you would bust with any card of value 6 or more, which is 8 out of 13 possibilities), standing is generally the stronger move. Although 30 is not extremely close to 35, the probability of drawing a safe card (1–5) is only 5\/13, making the bust risk too large to justify further hits on average.\n\nAnswer: Stand","You have a total of 13, which is far below the threshold of 39. Given the large gap between your total and 39, you can safely draw more cards without a high risk of exceeding 39. Therefore, the best move at this point is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on a threshold (N) of 39, a total of 18 is quite low, leaving substantial room (21 points) before reaching or exceeding 39. It is generally advantageous to continue drawing additional cards because the risk of immediately busting (going over 39) at 18 is relatively small. Therefore, the recommended move in this situation is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 22 and the threshold of 39, you have enough room to take at least one more card without risking an immediate bust (the highest-value card is a King worth 13 points and 22 + 13 = 35 < 39). With the opponent’s face-up card at 8 and three unknown cards, it is likely they will continue to draw unless they already have a relatively high total. Therefore, drawing an additional card (Hit) is advisable to better position yourself to reach a total closer to 39.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 27 and a threshold of 39, it is generally advantageous to try for a higher total given the relatively low probability of drawing the one rank (King = 13) that would cause a bust. Therefore, the best move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 36 and the threshold of 39, drawing another card has a 10\/13 chance of exceeding 39 and losing immediately. Meanwhile, your opponent stood after only two hits (likely indicating a moderately safe total but not necessarily above 36). Standing at 36 gives a reasonable chance that your total is already higher (or at least equal) to the opponent’s without risking an immediate bust. Therefore, the recommended move here is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given that your total is only 14 while the threshold is 34, you are quite far from busting. It is generally advantageous to draw more cards in an attempt to get closer to 34 without exceeding it. Therefore, the recommended move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a total of 25 versus a threshold of 34, standing this early leaves significant room for the opponent to draw closer to 34 or surpass 25. Statistically, drawing another card has around a 70% chance of keeping you under 34 (since only ranks 10, J, Q, K—4 out of 13—would bust you). Given that 25 is not especially close to 34, it is generally advantageous to attempt to improve your total rather than stand.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total (26) versus the threshold (34), standing at 26 leaves a high likelihood that the opponent can draw closer to 34 without busting. Although there is some risk of going over 34, the probability of improving beyond 26 (and thereby better challenging the opponent) is favorable. Therefore, the advisable move here is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","It is risky to hit when you have already reached the threshold, because any additional card will push you over 34. Therefore, standing here is the best move.\n\nAnswer: Stand","You have already reached the threshold (34). Taking another card would exceed 34 and cause you to lose if the opponent does not also exceed 34. Therefore, the best move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given that you are already at the threshold total of 34, drawing any additional card (even an Ace, worth 1) would push you to 35 or more, thereby exceeding the threshold of 34. According to the rules, exceeding N results in an immediate loss unless the opponent also exceeds N. Therefore, the optimal move is to continue standing.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current game state, you have already reached the threshold (34). Taking another card (Hit) would inevitably push your total above the threshold if it’s anything other than an Ace (which would still bring you to 35). Therefore, the best move is to continue Standing and let the opponent finish their turns.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given that the threshold (N) is 30 and your current total is only 13, you still have significant room before risking going over 30. Standing at 13 would give up too much potential to improve your hand. Thus, hitting is the better choice.\n\nAnswer: Hit","You are well below the threshold of 30, and the chance of drawing a card that would cause you to exceed 30 is not especially high compared to the benefit of improving your total. Therefore, it is generally advisable to continue drawing to aim for a higher total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold of 30 and your current total of 28, drawing another card carries a very high risk of exceeding 30 (busting). Since only drawing an Ace (value 1) or a 2 would keep you under or at the threshold, you have a much higher chance of busting by hitting than of improving your hand. Therefore, the safer strategy is to stand with 28 and hope that your opponent either goes over 30 on their subsequent hits or does not reach a higher total than 28.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the threshold N = 29, your current total of 14 is relatively low. Since the goal is to get as close to 29 as possible without exceeding it, the recommended move is to request another card (Hit). \n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold (N = 29) and your current total of 21, drawing another card has a significant chance (roughly 38%) of causing you to exceed 29 if you draw a card valued 9 or higher (9, 10, J, Q, or K). Standing at 21 is a safer option, especially given that the opponent’s visible card is a Jack (11) and you have no certainty about their hidden cards. By standing, you avoid the potential bust and force the opponent to take the risk of drawing more cards to beat 21 without exceeding 29.\n\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

You have significant room before exceeding 43 and can improve your total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that the threshold is 43 and your current total is only 20, the risk of going over 43 with one additional card is relatively low. Since the objective is to get as close to 43 as possible without busting, continuing to draw cards (hitting) is the stronger move at this point.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 25 versus a threshold of 43, there is still ample room to draw without immediately risking a bust, and you likely need to increase your total further to beat the opponent’s unknown but potentially competitive hand. Therefore, hitting is the better choice at this juncture.\n\nAnswer: Hit","You currently have a total of 35, which is well below the threshold of 43. Standing on 35 would likely lose to an opponent who has already stood (and is probably at or near a total above 35). Although there is some risk of busting (you will exceed 43 if you draw 9 or higher), you still have a better chance of improving to a total that can match or beat the opponent’s score by hitting. Therefore, hitting gives you a higher expected chance of winning or at least drawing.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current totals, you have 40 points, only 3 away from the threshold of 43. Drawing another card has a high risk of busting (any card of value 4 or more would push you over 43). Standing preserves a strong total (40), giving you a decent chance to win or at least draw if the opponent has exceeded 43 or has not surpassed 40.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the game’s threshold of 25 and your current total of 11, it is safe to take at least one more card without going over 25 even in the worst-case scenario (drawing a 13-point King). Therefore, the most logical move is to request another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a threshold of 25, having a total of only 18 still leaves enough room (7 points) before busting. Although there is a risk of drawing an 8 or higher and exceeding 25, standing on 18 now gives the opponent plenty of opportunity to surpass 18 without busting. Given these considerations, the preferable action is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current situation, your total is 22 against a threshold of 25. Drawing another card carries a high risk of exceeding 25 unless you draw a very low-value card. It is generally safer to stand and hope the dealer either busts or ends up with a lower total.\n\nAnswer: Stand","I would request another card (Hit) because my current total is far from the threshold.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 16 against a threshold of 44, you have ample room before risk of busting. Because face cards can add 11 to 13 points, even drawing one large-valued card would take you to the high 20s, still safely below 44. Therefore, a good strategy here is to continue drawing at least once more to improve your total before your opponent decides to stop.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a threshold (N) of 44, your total is 23, leaving a substantial margin before busting. It is generally advantageous to continue drawing in order to approach 44 more closely. Therefore, the recommended action is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a total of 29 against a threshold of 44, it is safe to hit again because the highest card value is 13, which would bring your total to at most 42 (still under 44). Therefore, the optimal choice here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I would take another card here. Standing on 36 when the threshold is 44 leaves too large a gap, making it relatively easy for the opponent (who has shown an aggressive hitting strategy) to surpass 36 without busting. Hitting gives a good chance of improving my total to something closer to 44, which should, on average, offer a better chance of winning given the opponent’s tendency to draw multiple cards.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I will Stand.  \nAnswer: Stand","I recommend taking another card (Hit), because your current total of 18 is still far from the threshold of 39, leaving you ample room to draw without exceeding 39.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold of 39 and your current total of 28, you still have a reasonable margin (11 points) before busting. Although there is some risk of drawing a Q (12) or K (13) and exceeding 39, there is a higher likelihood (11 out of 13 possible ranks) that you will safely remain under the threshold and improve your total. Standing on 28 would give the opponent ample opportunity to surpass your total. Therefore, the better move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold (N = 39) and the fact that your current total is 33, drawing another card carries more than a 50% chance of busting (any card with a value of 7 or more will exceed the threshold). Meanwhile, your opponent—whose strategy has shown a tendency to draw multiple cards—still faces a significant risk of busting if they continue to hit. It is therefore prudent to stand at 33 rather than risk exceeding 39.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given your current total of 21 and a threshold of 30, you still have a 9-point margin before exceeding N. Drawing one additional card gives you a reasonable chance (9 out of 13 card ranks) of improving your total without busting. Since 21 is not particularly close to 30 and your opponent can still draw multiple cards, taking a hit increases your expected final total and your chances of winning.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 26 and the threshold of 30, drawing another card risks a high chance of exceeding 30. Standing at 26 is safer, as the likelihood of busting on a hit is significant. Therefore, the recommended move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on your current total of 23 against a threshold of 46, there is still a substantial gap (23 points) before reaching 46. Even a high-value card (13 points) would bring you only to 36, which remains under 46. Consequently, it seems prudent to continue drawing cards to move closer to 46.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a threshold of 46 and a current total of 36, drawing another card has about a 23% chance of immediately exceeding 46 (if you draw a J, Q, or K) and about a 77% chance of staying at or below 46 (if you draw anything else). Standing at 36 would likely be too low to beat the opponent, given they typically continue drawing in higher-threshold rounds. Therefore, the statistically favorable move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 39 against the high threshold of 46, there is a reasonable chance that the opponent will draw enough to surpass 39 (or cause you to lose if you remain at 39). Even though there is some risk of busting (drawing an 8 or higher), hitting gives you a chance to get closer to 46 and improve your odds of winning.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your total is exactly 46, which matches the threshold (N = 46), taking another card would inevitably push you over the threshold and result in a loss (unless the opponent also exceeds 46, which is too risky to bank on). Therefore, the optimal move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","You currently have a very low total (3) against a relatively high threshold (38). There's virtually no risk in hitting at this stage because you are far from exceeding 38. Therefore, the most logical move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Hit\n\nAnswer: Hit","Hit\n\nAnswer: Hit","I would take another card here because my total is only 16 against a threshold of 38, leaving ample room before risking a bust.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I will take another card to try to get closer to 38 without going over.  \n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 31 versus the threshold of 38, it is generally advantageous to try improving your total rather than standing on 31, especially since the opponent has already stood and may have a higher total. You have 7 points of “room” before busting, so drawing a card worth 7 or less will keep you at or below 38. The probability of drawing such a card is 7\/13 (since A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 would not cause a bust). Although there is some risk (cards of value 8 or higher would bust you), you increase your chances of beating the opponent by hitting here.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Stand\n\nAnswer: Stand","You currently have a total of 10 (9 + A), which is far below the threshold of 40. Since you have ample room before risking a bust, a hit is the most logical choice to try improving your total. Standing on 10 with a high threshold of 40 would leave you at a major disadvantage, given how much higher your final total can potentially go without exceeding 40. Therefore, you should continue to draw cards.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the threshold (N) of 40 and your current total of 13, you are well below the limit. You have considerable room to draw additional cards without risking a bust. Consequently, the recommended action is to “Hit” to improve your total and move closer to 40.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold of 40 and your current total of 19, drawing one more card cannot cause you to exceed 40 (even the highest-value card, K = 13, would bring you to 32). Therefore, it is statistically safe to take another card to move closer to the target of 40 without risking an immediate bust. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 23 with a threshold of 40, you cannot bust on your next draw (the highest card value is 13, which would bring you at most to 36). Therefore, it is advantageous to Hit again. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 28 versus a threshold of 40, there is a relatively small chance (1\/13) of busting if you draw a King, but a much larger chance (12\/13) of safely improving your total. Stopping at 28 gives the opponent a wide margin to surpass your total. Thus, it is prudent to continue drawing.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I would stand here. With a total of 36 against a threshold of 40, hitting carries a 9\/13 chance of busting (drawing 5 or higher). The risk (nearly 70%) outweighs the benefit of possibly incrementing the total by only 1–4 points. Hence, standing is the safer play.\n\nAnswer: Stand","You currently have a total of 14 with a threshold of 28, and no single draw can cause you to exceed 28 on your next hit. Therefore, it is reasonable to take at least one more card.  \n\nAnswer: Hit","With a total of 17 against a threshold of 28, there is still a comfortable margin (11 points) before busting. The probability of drawing one of the higher-value face cards (Q = 12, K = 13) that would force a bust is relatively small (2 out of 13 possible draws in an infinite deck model), making “Hit” a prudent choice to try to improve your total and outscore the opponent.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a current total of 22 against a threshold of 28, drawing another card carries a substantial risk (any card 7 or higher would bust you). Meanwhile, the opponent has already stood, and based on past rounds, their standing total is not always high. Standing conserves your strong total of 22, which may already beat the opponent (especially given their sometimes premature stands in previous rounds). Therefore, the most prudent move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given that your current total is 18 and the highest possible card value is 13 (K), drawing one card cannot exceed the threshold of 31 (18 + 13 = 31). Therefore, there is no immediate risk of going over N by taking at least one card. Consequently, the best move at this point is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 25 with a threshold of 31, standing would leave you vulnerable to the opponent surpassing 25 with relative ease. Although there is a risk of busting by drawing a 7 or higher (7 out of 13 possible ranks), there is still a sizable chance (6 out of 13) to improve your total without immediately exceeding 31.

Even if you draw the highest-value card (K = 13), your total would be 29, which remains safely under 33. Thus, taking at least one additional card (Hit) is a reasonable approach to improve your total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","It is generally advantageous to draw at least once more in this situation because you cannot bust on your next card (the highest possible draw is a King for 13 points, bringing you exactly to 33). A total of 20 is quite far from 33, so raising your total will likely improve your chances without immediate risk of exceeding the threshold.\n\nAnswer: Hit","You already have a total of 29, which is close to the threshold of 33. Drawing another card risks a high probability of exceeding 33 and busting (since only 4 out of 13 possible card values would keep you under 33). Therefore, the safer choice is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","With a threshold of 29 and a current total of only 10, you are still far from exceeding the threshold. Since there is minimal risk in drawing another card, it is generally advantageous to hit and aim closer to 29 before potentially standing. Therefore, the best move here is to \"Hit.\"\n\nAnswer: Hit","Hit\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 23 versus a threshold of 29, the safer strategy is to try to improve the total. Although there is a risk of busting (drawing 7 or higher would exceed 29), standing on 23 leaves a large gap for the opponent to surpass your total. Drawing a card has a 6\/13 chance of safely landing between 24 and 29, which could put more pressure on the opponent. Therefore, the recommended move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","You have already exceeded the threshold (29) with a total of 31. Once you exceed N, you can only hope the opponent also exceeds N for a draw; taking another card will not improve your situation. The best move is to stand and hope the opponent goes over 29 as well.\n\nAnswer: Stand","With a high threshold of 41 and a current total of only 19, you have considerable room before exceeding N. Drawing additional cards can help you get closer to 41 and potentially surpass the opponent’s total, especially since their visible total is only 5 so far. Therefore, it’s generally advantageous to continue drawing rather than stand on 19.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the threshold of 41 and your current total of 28, drawing one more card cannot bust you because even the highest-value card (K = 13) would bring you exactly to 41. Standing at 28 would likely allow your opponent to surpass your total, taking advantage of the high threshold. Hence, the safer and more advantageous choice is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Hit. Given the threshold of 41 and holding a total of 31, there is still ample room (10 points) before busting. Only three ranks (J, Q, K) would cause an immediate bust (probability 3\/13 ≈ 23%), so the chance of drawing a safe card (10\/13 ≈ 77%) is favorable.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Stand\n\nAnswer: Stand","With a total of 37 against a threshold of 41, drawing another card carries a high risk of exceeding 41. Standing preserves your current total, which is reasonably close to 41. Therefore, the best decision here is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current total of 10 versus the threshold of 34, it is generally advantageous to take another card to move closer to 34. Therefore, the recommended move on Turn 1 is to \"Hit\".\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a current total of 12 against a threshold of 34, there is no immediate risk of busting on the next draw (even the highest-value card, K=13, would only bring your total to 25). Therefore, it is advantageous to continue drawing in order to approach 34 more closely.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 24 versus the threshold of 34, you still have a 10-point cushion before exceeding the threshold. While there is some risk of drawing an 11 or higher (J=11, Q=12, K=13) and busting, the probability of busting is 3\/13 (~23%), which means there is a significantly higher chance (10\/13) of drawing a card that keeps you under 34. Since 24 is considerably lower than 34 and the opponent may well exceed 24 on their next turn, taking another card (Hit) provides a better chance of reaching a higher total without busting.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current totals and the high likelihood of busting (an 11\/13 chance if you draw again), standing on 32 is the safer choice. With the opponent already standing, taking another card risks immediately losing if you exceed 34. Standing preserves your 32, which could still win or draw depending on the opponent’s unknown total.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current total of 11 and a high threshold of 50, it is generally advantageous to take another card. The opponent’s visible card is only a 2, and we are far from exceeding 50. Therefore, the best move is to “Hit.”\n\nAnswer: Hit","You currently have 23 versus a large threshold of 50. There is substantial room to draw additional cards before risking going over 50. Therefore, the sensible move here is to continue drawing in order to improve your total rather than stand on 23.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I would take another card. Since the threshold is 50 and my total is 35, even the highest-value card (K = 13) would only bring me to 48, which is still safely below 50.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a current total of 37 and a threshold of 50, drawing one more card cannot make you exceed 50 (since the highest card value is 13, which would bring you exactly to 50). Therefore, it is safe and advantageous to continue drawing.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a threshold of 50 and a current total of 40, the odds of improving (drawing 1–10) outweigh the risk of busting (drawing 11–13). Therefore, taking another card is statistically favorable compared to standing on 40.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Stand\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given that your total is already at 48 and the threshold is 50, the probability of busting on a Hit (i.e., drawing 3 or higher) is quite high. You only avoid busting if you draw an Ace (1) or a 2, which is a 2\/13 chance from an infinite deck. Statistically, it is far safer to keep your 48 and hope the dealer busts or does not surpass your total. Therefore, the optimal move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on your current total of 48 against a threshold of 50, requesting another card would risk exceeding 50 on most draws (anything 3 or above immediately busts). Therefore, the statistically safer choice is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","You currently have a total of 9, which is very far from the threshold of 41. It is generally optimal to continue drawing cards at this stage to avoid missing out on potential gains and to bring your total closer to 41. Therefore, you should hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I recommend continuing to draw cards because your current total (22) is still reasonably far from the threshold (41). The risk of busting on the next draw is low compared to the potential benefit of increasing your total closer to 41.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I would take another card because my total (23) is still far from 41, and even the largest single card (K=13) would bring me only to 36, which is still under the threshold. Therefore, the best move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 32 versus the threshold of 41, standing at 32 is likely too low to beat the opponent (who has already stopped drawing cards and is probably holding a total near or above 32). Although drawing another card carries some risk of busting, the chance of improving your total closer to 41 makes a “Hit” the more favorable option overall.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I will stand. Drawing any additional card would guarantee exceeding the threshold (41) and result in a bust.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the threshold (N=30) and your current total of 17, there is no single card in the deck that can make you exceed 30 in one draw. Therefore, the optimal decision for your next move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I would take another card here. Standing on 23 leaves too much room for the opponent to beat that total. Although there is some risk of busting, drawing one more card gives a reasonable chance to improve the total closer to 30.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Stand is the only viable option. You have already exceeded the threshold (32 > 30). According to the rules, if you exceed N and your opponent does not, you lose; if you both exceed N, you draw. Hitting cannot reduce your total, so standing gives you the only remaining chance, which is hoping the opponent also exceeds N.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the rules, your total (32) already exceeds the threshold (30). Once you exceed N, you cannot avoid busting. The only way not to lose is if your opponent also ends up exceeding 30, in which case the round would be a draw. Since you have already chosen to stand, no further action is possible on your side. You must await the opponent’s final total to determine whether you lose or draw.\n\nAnswer: Stand","With a total of only 7 against a threshold of 27, it is generally advantageous to continue drawing cards. Standing now would leave you far from 27, giving the opponent a strong chance to win. Therefore, the best move here is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold of 27 and the opponent having a King plus an unknown card (likely totaling somewhere around the low‐to‐mid 20s), standing on 16 yields a low expected score. A straightforward way to see this is to compare:\n\n• Standing on 16:  \n  – You only beat the opponent if their total is 14 or 15 (2 out of 13 possibilities) or tie if they have 16 (1 out of 13).  \n  – This leads to an expected score of around 0.19.\n\n• Hitting on 16 (even just once):  \n  – You can improve your total substantially without too high a risk of busting (busting happens only if you draw a Queen or King, 2 out of 13).  \n  – A detailed calculation (using a recursive or “dynamic programming”‐style approach) shows the expected score is notably higher, above 0.55 when you at least hit once from 16.\n\nHence, the best move from a total of 16, given the opponent has already stood, is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold of 27 and your current total of 19, you have an 8\/13 chance of drawing a card valued 1–8 (which would keep you at or below 27) and a 5\/13 chance of drawing a 9 or higher (which would bust you). By comparing the resulting totals (if you do not bust) to the opponent’s possible totals with a King showing (13 + unknown), the expected score from hitting is higher than from standing at 19. Therefore, the best move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 27, taking another card would cause you to exceed the threshold (27) and lose (since the opponent has already stood and therefore cannot exceed 27). Standing at exactly 27 guarantees you are at least as close (in fact, right at the threshold) as the opponent could possibly be, so the correct move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Hit\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold of 29 and your current total of 20, there is still a significant range (21–29) that would improve your position without exceeding N. Although there is some risk of drawing a 10 (value 10), J (11), Q (12), or K (13) and immediately busting, the chance of drawing a lower-value card (A–9) is higher. Standing on 20 is not especially strong when the opponent’s visible card is already a J (11), since they could easily surpass 20. Therefore, the more favorable move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I would choose to take another card. Given the threshold is 29 and I currently have 22, standing likely leaves me behind a standing opponent. Although there is a risk of busting, taking a hit offers a reasonable chance to improve my total and potentially exceed the opponent's hand.\n\nAnswer: Hit","It is very early in the round, and with a total of only 7 against a threshold of 34, it is generally advisable to draw more cards to move closer to 34 before stopping. Therefore, the best move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total (14) and the threshold (34), you still have substantial room before risking a bust. Drawing another card (“Hit”) is statistically favorable because even the highest-value card (13) would only take your total to 27, which remains safely below 34. Therefore, the recommended move is to continue with another “Hit.”\n\nAnswer: Hit","It is generally advantageous to continue drawing when you have 23 and the threshold is 34 since there is a good chance of improving your hand without going over 34. Standing on 23 leaves you too far below the threshold and likely behind your opponent’s final total.

It is generally advantageous to draw additional cards to increase our total and get closer to 39. Thus, the best move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold of 39 and your current total of 23, drawing one more card cannot make you exceed 39 (because the highest-value card, K = 13, would bring you to 36). Therefore, it is advantageous to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a threshold of 39 and your current total at 28, you still have a comfortable margin before exceeding 39. Drawing another card has a relatively low bust probability (since only Q or K would cause an immediate bust), and standing at 28 is likely too low against an opponent who can continue drawing. Therefore, the best move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given your current total of 36, drawing another card carries a high risk of exceeding the threshold of 39. Therefore, it is generally advisable to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","You have already chosen to stand on your 36. Since you cannot take any further actions after standing, there is no additional move to make. The round will conclude once the opponent finishes their turn.\n\nAnswer: Stand","With a total of 36, drawing an additional card has a high likelihood of causing a bust (anything 4 or higher will exceed 39). Therefore, there is little benefit in hitting further. The optimal move is to continue standing and await the opponent’s final total.\n\nAnswer: Stand","You have already chosen to stand starting from Turn 4, and there is no option to change that decision. Once a player stands, they cannot take additional hits. Therefore, no further action is possible on your part. \n\nAnswer: Stand","I will Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","You have already chosen to stand on Turn 1 with a total of 20, which is quite close to the threshold of 24. In most cases, drawing another card here carries a high risk of busting (any 5 or higher would exceed 24). Since you have already stood, there is no further action for you to take; you must wait for the opponent to finish their turn.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the threshold (N = 41), having a total of only 18 is still quite far from going bust. Even the largest single card (K = 13) would only bring your total to 31, safely below 41. Hence, drawing at least one more card is low risk and offers a better chance to improve your total before standing.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold of 41 and your current total of 24—which cannot bust on a single draw (the highest-value card is K=13, leading to a total of 37)—it is advantageous to continue drawing cards. Therefore, you should Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Hit. With a total of 30 against a threshold of 41, standing now risks being overtaken by the opponent. The probability of busting on the next draw is relatively low (only if drawing Q or K, i.e., 2 out of 13 ranks), making a hit the stronger play.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a total of 31 against a threshold of 41, you still have room before potentially exceeding N. The risk of drawing a face card (J, Q, K), which would make you bust, is relatively low compared to the benefit of improving your total. Therefore, it is generally favorable to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I would take another card. With a threshold of 41 and a current total of 33, there is still enough room to try improving the total without facing an overwhelming bust probability. Standing at 33 leaves too large a gap that the opponent could overcome without necessarily busting.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a threshold of 41, a total of 34 is still relatively far from 41. Although there is a significant risk of busting (drawing an 8 or higher would put you over 41), standing on 34 is quite risky if the opponent’s total is above 34. Hitting gives you a reasonable chance (7 out of 13 card values) to improve your total without exceeding 41, which could be enough to beat the opponent. Therefore, the recommended move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Stand\n\nReasoning:  \n• Your total is 39, just 2 points below the threshold (41). Hitting has a high chance of producing 3 or more (busting you), and only an Ace (1) or a “2” would safely keep you at or under 41.  \n• The opponent has already stood with six total cards (face-up “7” plus five unknowns). Over multiple draws, the average total for those five unknown cards is likely to push them close to or past 41, giving you a good chance to win (or draw) by simply standing on 39.\n\nAnswer: Stand","I would take another card in this situation (Hit). With a total of 15 against a threshold of 27, it is generally worthwhile to try to improve your total further. There is only a small chance (1\/13) of busting by drawing a 13-value King (which would take you to 28). Any other draw either brings you closer to 27 or lands exactly on 27, allowing you to stand with a strong total. Meanwhile, the opponent has shown a tendency (in previous rounds) to keep hitting until they exceed the threshold, which increases the likelihood that they will bust. Therefore, drawing another card (Hit) is the more favorable move.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I would stand here. Given that your total is already 23, drawing an additional card has a high likelihood of pushing you over the threshold of 27. Meanwhile, from the historical rounds, the opponent’s pattern appears to involve drawing aggressively, often leading them to exceed the threshold. Standing at 23 forces the opponent to face the risk of busting on further hits, which has repeatedly happened so far.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Hit\n\nAnswer: Hit","Hit\n\nAnswer: Hit","It is very risky to hit when you already have 24, since only an Ace (counting as 1) or a 2 would avoid busting. Standing is safer because your opponent’s strategy (based on the history) tends to continue hitting and often goes over the threshold, leading to a bust.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on your current total of 10 and the threshold of 27, it is generally safe to take another card. You are quite far from 27 and have room to increase your total without risking an immediate bust. Therefore, the best move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on all previous rounds, the opponent consistently continues hitting until they eventually exceed the threshold. Standing on 12 ensures they will most likely bust again, giving you a winning outcome.\n\nAnswer: Stand","You already chose to stand on Turn 2, so under these rules there is no further action you can take this round. Once a player stands, they cannot take another card. The opponent will continue and either draw until they stand or exceed the threshold. Your total remains 12.\n\nAnswer: Stand","With a threshold of 46 and a current total of 10, you have a large margin before risking going bust. Therefore, you should continue drawing cards to increase your total and improve your chances of approaching 46 without exceeding it.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a threshold of 46 and a current total of only 22, there is still plenty of room to draw more cards without immediately risking a bust. Moreover, the opponent’s pattern so far shows a propensity to draw aggressively and often exceed the threshold. Hitting again provides a good chance to improve your total while still staying comfortably below 46, especially given that a draw of even the highest-value card (K = 13) would bring you only to 35. Therefore, continuing to Hit is generally the stronger play here.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current round’s threshold (46) and your total of 34, you have a 12-point gap before exceeding 46. Because only a King (worth 13 points) would cause a bust, you have a 12\/13 chance of safely improving your total. Hitting at least once more is therefore strongly favored—it carries only about an 8% bust risk and can bring you closer to the threshold, thus improving your odds of beating the opponent. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold (N = 46) and your current total (45), drawing virtually any card other than an Ace would cause you to exceed 46 and bust. Since there is only a 1-in-13 chance of drawing an Ace (worth 1 point) to safely reach 46, and a 12-in-13 chance of drawing a card worth 2 or more (and thus busting), the recommended move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","It’s almost never worth risking a hit when you’re already at 45 against a threshold of 46, because any card other than an Ace would make you exceed 46 and lose outright. Although drawing an Ace would get you to 46 exactly, that’s only a 1\/13 chance from an infinite standard deck. Standing is by far the safer (and thus better) play.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current total of 45, which is very close to the threshold of 46, drawing another card would risk exceeding the threshold unless it happens to be an Ace (value 1). Since the probability of drawing exactly an Ace from an infinite deck is relatively low (1\/13), standing is the safer choice to avoid busting.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given your current total of 45 versus a threshold of 46, drawing any card other than an Ace (1 point) would cause you to exceed 46. Since the chance of drawing an Ace from an infinite deck is 1\/13, the risk of busting (12\/13) is too high. Therefore, it is best to continue standing and force the opponent to risk exceeding the threshold.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on your hand total of 45 (just one point under the threshold of 46), drawing another card would carry a very high chance of exceeding 46 and losing automatically. The smarter play is to Stand, forcing the opponent to continue drawing and risk busting or staying below your strong total.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on your current total of 11 versus the opponent's visible 8 and a threshold of 25, it’s generally advisable to take at least one more card since 11 is quite far from 25. Thus, the best move here is \"Hit.\"\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the opponent’s demonstrated pattern of consistently exceeding the threshold in previous rounds, it is generally advantageous to avoid risking a bust. Although 13 is not very close to 25, the opponent appears inclined to draw aggressively, leading them to surpass N. Therefore, the best move here is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","With a threshold of 48 and a current total of only 11, there is essentially no risk of busting by requesting another card (even a maximum-value face card of 13 would only bring you to 24). Therefore, it is advantageous to continue drawing cards to increase your total and get closer to 48 before standing.\n\nAnswer: Hit","It is generally advantageous to continue drawing when you are still far from the threshold. At a total of 20 against a threshold of 48, you have significant room to safely add cards without exceeding 48.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Hit\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given your total of 37 and a threshold of 48, drawing another card offers a good chance to improve your position without busting (since only Q or K, each worth 12 or 13, would take you over 48). Standing at 37 is risky because the opponent is likely to continue drawing and may easily surpass 37. Therefore, the most reasonable move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your total is 47 (just 1 point below 48), taking another card carries a high risk of busting (everything except an Ace pushes you over 48). While it’s possible to draw an Ace and reach exactly 48, this chance is small (about 1\/13 in an infinite deck), so it is generally better to stop. Therefore, the best move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Hit\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the threshold of 49 and the consistent pattern of your opponent repeatedly drawing until they exceed the threshold, the safest play is to stand on 16. Although you have a relatively low total, your opponent’s fixed strategy indicates they will continue hitting and are highly likely to bust, just as they did in all prior rounds.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the very high threshold (N = 49) and your current total of 16, there is no risk of busting by taking another card (the highest card value is 13, and 16 + 13 = 29, well below 49). Therefore, the best move is to continue drawing to improve your total and aim closer to the threshold. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that the threshold (N) is 49, you only have a total of 16, and you cannot bust until you reach 49 or more, it makes sense to continue drawing cards. Even a face card (valued at 11–13) added to 16 would still keep you well below 49. Therefore, the optimal move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that the threshold is a large 49 and your total is only 16, you still have a comfortable margin before risking a bust.

Since it is advantageous to improve the total closer to the threshold, the best move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the very large threshold (N=49) and your current low total of 7, it is generally advantageous to continue drawing cards rather than stand at such a low total. The chance of exceeding 49 by taking another card is negligible at this stage, so “Hit” is the best move to move closer to the threshold without risking going bust.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that the threshold (N) is very high (49) and your current total is only 9, you still have substantial room before risking an exceed. Therefore, the most logical move here is to continue drawing cards to increase your total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the threshold of 49 and your current total of 11, it is highly unlikely that standing now will give you a winning outcome. Since you are very far from 49, and there is ample room to draw more cards without busting, the best move here is to continue hitting to increase your total and get closer to the threshold.\n\nAnswer: Hit","You have a total of 19, which is far below the threshold of 49. Even drawing the highest-value card (13) would bring your total to at most 32 on the next draw, well under 49. Continuing to draw until you approach but do not exceed 49 is the optimal approach, as standing at 19 would likely lose to an opponent who can safely accumulate a much higher total. Therefore, your best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Since your total is 32, you cannot bust by drawing one more card (the maximum card value is 13, which would bring you to 45). Therefore, it is generally advantageous to take at least one more card rather than stand at 32.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 36, drawing any single card (2–13) will not exceed the threshold of 49 (since 36 + 13 = 49). Therefore, it is safe to take at least one more card to improve your total and increase the chances of ending up closer to 49 than your opponent.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I would take another card because 39 is quite far from 49, and the probability of beneficially improving my total (without busting) outweighs the risk of going over 49.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 46 (with N = 49), hitting would risk drawing 4 or more (which occurs with 10 out of 13 possible ranks) and thereby exceeding 49. Since that probability (≈77%) is unfavorable, the best course of action is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current total of 16 and the threshold of 41, you cannot exceed 41 with just one more card (since the maximum card value is 13, and 16 + 13 = 29). Therefore, it is generally advantageous to take at least one more card to move closer to the threshold.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a total of 27 against a threshold of 41, there is still a comfortable margin (14 points) before busting. Drawing another card provides a good opportunity to approach 41 more closely without exceeding it. Therefore, it is generally optimal to continue with at least one more hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given your current total of 36 and the threshold (N) of 41, drawing another card carries a high risk of busting (you will exceed 41 if you draw a 6 or higher, which happens with 8 out of the 13 possible ranks). Although a successful low draw (5 or under) could improve your total, the probability of busting is substantial. Standing at 36 avoids an immediate loss by busting and forces the opponent to risk drawing to beat 36 without exceeding 41. Therefore, standing is typically the safer choice.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the threshold (N=35) and your current total of 19, drawing one additional card cannot cause you to exceed 35 (since the highest card value is 13 and 19 + 13 = 32). Therefore, it is safe and advantageous to “Hit” at least once to try to improve your hand.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 22, you cannot exceed 35 by taking exactly one more card (since the highest-value card is 13, which would bring you at most to 35). Therefore, it is safe and advantageous to take another card in an effort to get closer to the threshold of 35.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a total of 31 against a threshold of 35, drawing another card runs a high risk of exceeding 35 (since only a 1, 2, 3, or 4 would keep you under the threshold). Standing at 31 forces the opponent to either risk drawing to surpass your total—potentially busting—or settle below 31 and lose. Therefore, it is prudent to Stand. \n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current total of just 4, and with a high Threshold (N = 46), you should continue to draw cards to move closer to 46 while minimizing the risk of going bust. Therefore, the best move here is \"Hit\". \n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that the threshold is 46 and your current total is only 14, there is very little risk in taking additional cards. You still have a large margin before potentially exceeding 46, so hitting again is the better play.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a threshold of 46 and holding a total of 17, you are still far from risking a bust. Since even drawing the highest-value card (13) would only bring you to 30, well below 46, you have a good margin to continue drawing safely to improve your total. Therefore, it makes strategic sense to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a total of 30 against a threshold of 46, you still have a safe margin to draw additional cards without immediately risking a bust. A single high card (worth 13) would bring your total to 43, which remains below 46. Therefore, the most prudent move is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the given threshold of 46 and your current total of 32, you can safely draw another card without risking an immediate bust (the highest card value is 13, which would bring your total to 45). Standing at 32 would leave you relatively far from 46, so the stronger move is to continue and request another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Stand\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given the threshold of 28 and your current total of 25, drawing another card carries a high likelihood (10\/13) of exceeding 28 and losing immediately. Meanwhile, the opponent has only 4 plus an unknown card, so there is a good chance they will need to draw multiple times and risk busting. Therefore, standing on 25 is prudent.\n\nAnswer: Stand","You have already chosen to stand with a total of 25, which is a sensible decision given that drawing almost any card worth 4 or more would cause you to exceed the threshold of 28. Since you have already stood, there are no further moves for you to make in this turn.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current total of 11 (well below the threshold of 43), there is quite a bit of room to draw additional cards safely. It’s highly advantageous to “Hit” and try to improve your total toward the upper boundary without much risk of busting on this turn.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total (23) and the threshold of 43, you have a 20-point cushion before busting. Even drawing the highest-value card (K\/Q = 13) would only bring you to 36, which is still safely below 43. Therefore, it is generally advantageous to continue drawing at least one more card to try to get closer to 43 and improve your final total. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Hit. Since your total is 29 and the threshold is 43, one more card cannot make you exceed 43 (even a King would only bring you to 42). Therefore, drawing another card is the best move.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I would take another card here. With a total of 35 and a threshold of 43, standing on 35 leaves too much room for the opponent to surpass you without busting. Although there is some risk of going over 43 if you draw a high-value card (9, 10, J, Q, K), statistically it is still more favorable to attempt improving your total beyond 35. \n\nAnswer: Hit","I would stand at 41 to avoid the high likelihood of busting when the threshold is 43.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the threshold of 26 and your current total of 9, standing immediately would almost certainly lose against the opponent’s visible Queen (12 points) plus unknown card. You have ample room (17 points) before exceeding 26, so the best move is to take at least one card to increase your total. Therefore, the correct move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Hit\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold of 26, sitting on only 22 is quite risky if the opponent already stands (they may well have 23–26). Although hitting is dangerous (you bust with any draw of 5 or higher), it is often still preferable here, because 22 is relatively low compared to 26 and you have a 4\/13 chance to improve to 23–26, which can beat or tie many of the totals the opponent might stand on. Standing at 22 would automatically lose to any opponent total of 23 or more (unless they are also bust), so the higher-upside play is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 17 versus the threshold of 34, it is safe to take another card (no single draw can exceed 34 from 17). Thus, the best move here is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a total of 27 against a threshold of 34, it is generally better to try for a card that can bring you closer to 34 rather than standing on 27. Although there is a risk of busting (drawing an 8 or higher would exceed 34), you still have a greater-than-50% chance of drawing a 7 or lower and improving your total without going over N. Hence, the recommended move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 33 versus the threshold of 34, taking another card carries a high risk of exceeding N. With only an Ace safely adding 1 point, the probability of drawing that Ace from an infinite deck is 1\/13 (about 7.7%), making a Hit very likely to bust. Therefore, the safer and stronger play is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Hit\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 24 points (4 + 11 + 9) and a threshold of 45, you are still quite far from exceeding the threshold. Drawing at least one more card seems advisable since the largest card value (K = 13) added to 24 would bring you to 37, still below 45. Therefore, it is generally safer to continue drawing to move closer to 45, rather than standing on 24.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total (26) and the high threshold (45), taking at least one more card is very low-risk (even drawing a King, 13 points, would only bring you to 39). Hence, the recommended action is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given your current total of 28 and the threshold of 45, there is still a comfortable margin (17 points) before exceeding the threshold. Drawing another card poses a relatively low risk of immediately going over 45 (since the maximum card value is 13, which would bring your total to at most 41 on the next draw). Consequently, it is advantageous to continue hitting to try to get closer to 45. Therefore, the recommended move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given your current total of 32 and the threshold of 45, drawing another card will not exceed the threshold even in the worst-case scenario (drawing a King, worth 13, would bring your total to exactly 45). Therefore, it is advisable to continue and request another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 37 (which is only 8 away from the threshold of 45), the relatively high chance of busting with another card draw, and the opponent’s history of often exceeding the threshold, the safer strategy is to stop drawing additional cards and stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current threshold (N=41) and having a total of only 14 points, it is generally advantageous to request additional cards to increase your total without exceeding 41. Standing on 14 would leave too much opportunity for the opponent to surpass your total comfortably. Therefore, the best move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold (N = 41) and your current total of 26, drawing one more card cannot bust you (because the highest card value is 13, which would bring you to 39). Hence, it is advantageous to take at least one more Hit to move closer to 41 before risking an overshoot.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a total of 30 against a threshold of 41, you are still quite far from busting and need to improve your hand to have a better chance of beating the opponent.

There is ample room to draw additional cards without exceeding 32, so continuing to draw (Hit) is generally a reasonable choice in hopes of improving your hand.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given a threshold of 32, a total of 16 still leaves a lot of room before exceeding 32. Drawing an additional card is a reasonable choice to try to improve the total. Therefore, the best move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Hit\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a threshold of 48, having only 12 points leaves plenty of room to safely take additional cards. It is generally advantageous to continue drawing until reaching a higher total that is closer to 48 without going over. Therefore, the best move on your first turn is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a threshold of 48, a total of 20 is very low relative to that target. Drawing another card poses minimal risk of exceeding 48, and generally you want to continue accumulating points until you approach the threshold. Therefore, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 24 (with N=48), it is generally advantageous to continue drawing cards, as 24 is still relatively far from 48. Therefore, the most reasonable choice here would be to Hit once more.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 30, there is no risk of busting on the next card (maximum card value is 13, which would bring the total to at most 43). Therefore, it is advantageous to take another card to try getting closer to the threshold of 48.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I would take another card because my total (31) is still comfortably below the threshold of 48, and a single additional card cannot push me over 48 (the highest-value card is a King worth 13, which would bring me to 44).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your total is currently 35 and the largest single card value is 13 (K), drawing another card cannot exceed the threshold of 48. Therefore, it is safe (and advisable) to continue drawing to get closer to N without risking a bust right now.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 37 and a threshold of 48, drawing another card has roughly an 85% chance of improving the total without going bust (since only Q or K, worth 12 or 13, would exceed 48). This relatively favorable probability suggests continuing with a “Hit” to move closer to 48.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Stand\n\nAnswer: Stand","With a threshold (N) of 45 and your current total of 12, you have a large margin before you risk exceeding 45. Drawing additional cards is generally safe at this stage and can help you improve your total. Therefore, the best move here is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","You currently have a total of 24, which is far from the threshold of 45. Even if you draw the highest-value face card (K = 13), your total would only reach 37, which remains under 45. Given this, drawing another card is relatively safe and offers a better chance to improve your total closer to 45. Therefore, the recommended move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 27 and the high threshold (45), drawing another card is safe (you cannot bust on the next card because the highest card value is 13, which would bring your total at most to 40). Since you are still far from reaching 45, it is advantageous to continue drawing to improve your total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","You currently have a total of 36 with a threshold of 45, so there is still room to draw without necessarily exceeding 45. Although there is a risk of getting a 10 or higher card (10, J=11, Q=12, K=13) and busting, the chance of drawing a smaller card (A=1 through 9) is higher. By taking another card, you have a good probability of improving your total and moving closer to 45, which can give you a stronger position against the opponent.\n\nAnswer: Hit","A reasonable approach here is to consider how likely it is you will bust by taking another card versus the chance your opponent will bust or fail to beat 40. With a total of 40 against a threshold of 45, you bust on any draw of 6 or higher (8 out of 13 possible card values), which is a substantial risk. Given that your opponent has already shown a pattern of overextending in previous rounds (busting in both Round 1 and Round 2), standing on 40 seems prudent. Even if the opponent avoids busting, there is no guarantee they will reach a total exceeding 40 without surpassing 45.\n\nTherefore, the better move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the high threshold (48), holding a total of only 21 leaves ample room to draw additional cards without busting. Since even the largest single card (K = 13) would yield just 34 and still remain under 48, it is generally advantageous to continue hitting to approach a stronger total closer to 48. \n\nAnswer: Hit","I will continue drawing cards because my current total of 27 is significantly below the threshold of 48, leaving room to improve my hand without an immediate risk of busting.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Hit\n\nAnswer: Hit","I recommend standing here because your total is already 42, and drawing another card carries a greater than 50% chance of busting (any card 7 or higher would exceed 48). Standing on 42 gives you a good chance of winning, especially given that your opponent has shown a tendency in previous rounds to keep hitting and risk going over the threshold.\n\nAnswer: Stand","With a total of 5 against a threshold of 41, it is far too low to stand. The best choice here is to continue drawing cards to get closer to 41 without going over.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 18 (with N = 41), you still have plenty of room before busting. Drawing another card increases your chances of moving closer to 41 and thus outscoring your opponent. Therefore, the recommended move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 21 against a threshold of 41, you still have plenty of room to draw additional cards without exceeding the threshold. It is generally advantageous to “hit” in this situation because stopping at 21 is far from 41, and the opponent could easily surpass 21 without busting. Therefore, the best move here is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I will take another card because my total of 25 is still well below the threshold of 41, and no single card draw can push me over 41 (the largest card is worth 13, which would bring me to 38).\n\nAnswer: Hit","I would continue drawing at a total of 29 with a threshold of 41 because there is only a 1-in-13 chance (drawing a King) of immediately busting on the next card, and 29 is still relatively far from 41. Given that the opponent has already drawn multiple times, it is worth taking at least one more card to try to improve my total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","You are at 39, which is very close to the threshold of 41. Drawing another card risks exceeding 41 on most card values, making busting likely. Therefore, it is safer to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current board state (Threshold = 39, your total = 14, opponent showing 10), it is generally wise to continue drawing cards rather than stop at such a low total. Therefore, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 26 with a threshold of 39, you cannot exceed 39 with just one additional card (the highest possible card value is 13, which would bring you exactly to 39). Therefore, it is advantageous to request another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold of 39 and your current total of 36, drawing another card has a high probability of busting (since only A, 2, or 3 would keep you at or under 39). Standing at 36 minimizes the risk of immediately losing by exceeding 39. Therefore, the advisable move here is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the threshold of 36 and your current total of 16, you have substantial room before risking an immediate bust. Drawing another card (Hit) is the most prudent move to try to improve your total closer to 36.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 17 versus the threshold of 36, you still have plenty of room before risking a bust. Drawing another card (“Hit”) is the sensible choice to try to improve your total and get closer to 36.\n\nAnswer: Hit","It is risky to stand at 28 when the threshold is 36, because 28 is still quite far below 36. Although there is some chance of busting if you draw (cards 9, 10, J, Q, or K would exceed 36), you also have a fairly good chance (8 out of 13) to draw a safe card and improve your total. Standing on 28 would give your opponent too easy a target to beat or tie. Therefore, the better move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold of 36 and your current total of 29 (seven points away from 36), drawing another card has slightly better than a 50% chance of keeping you at or below 36 (since any card 1 through 7 keeps you safe, while 8 or higher causes you to exceed 36). Standing on 29 gives the opponent ample room to surpass your total without busting. Therefore, taking another card (Hit) appears to be the stronger move.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I have a total of 33, which is only 3 away from exceeding 36. Drawing another card has a high probability of going over the threshold and resulting in a bust. Therefore, it is safer to stand and force the opponent to risk drawing additional cards or else settle for a potentially lower total.\n\nAnswer: Stand","I would choose to take another card (Hit). At a total of 18 with a threshold of 28, the probability of improving the hand without busting is favorable enough to warrant drawing at least one more card, aiming to get closer to 28 before standing.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","With a current total of only 9 against a threshold (N) of 35, there is plenty of room before potentially exceeding 35. Thus, it is generally advisable to request additional cards to move closer to the threshold. Therefore, the recommended move here is to “Hit.”\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 10 (7 + 2 + A) and a threshold of 35, it is very safe to continue drawing cards. Standing at 10 gives the opponent an easy path to surpass your total. Therefore, the best move at this moment is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold (N = 35) and your current total of 16, there is still a substantial gap from 35, and the risk of busting by drawing additional cards remains relatively low. Therefore, the strategic move is to continue drawing cards to try to improve your total closer to 35.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I would continue drawing. With a total of 27 against an N of 35, there is still moderate room before going bust, and standing on 27 makes it too easy for the opponent to surpass that total. Statistically, hitting here offers a better chance of finishing closer to 35 without exceeding it.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold of 35 and your current total of 29, standing now risks losing if the opponent’s total is anywhere from 30 to 35 (since they have already stood). Although drawing a new card carries a risk of busting (you will exceed 35 if you draw a 7 or higher), it is often preferable to attempt improving your total above 29. In most scenarios, staying at 29 when the opponent’s face-up card is 10 is too low to win reliably. Therefore, the advisable move here is to take another card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the large threshold (50) and your current total of 18, you have substantial room to safely draw additional cards without exceeding the limit. Additionally, the opponent’s visible card is only a 2, so they are likely still far below 50 as well. Hitting now increases your chances of getting closer to 50 and ultimately outscoring your opponent. Therefore, the recommended move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold of 50 and a current total of 26, it is generally advantageous to continue drawing. Even if you draw a high-value card (e.g., 13 points for a King), your total would only reach 39, which is still below 50. Hence, hitting again is a reasonable choice to try to get closer to 50 without exceeding it.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 36 and the threshold of 50, you cannot bust with a single draw (the highest-value card is 13, which would bring you to 49). Therefore, it is advantageous to continue drawing at least one more card to try to get closer to 50, rather than stand at 36.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I would choose to Stand because drawing any card other than an Ace (which has only a 1\/13 chance) would cause me to exceed 50 and bust, making a stand on 49 the most prudent move.\n\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Standing at 12 would likely lead to a loss unless the dealer exceeds 37.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I recommend hitting again. With a total of 14 against a threshold of 37, there is still significant room to draw additional cards without exceeding 37, and standing now would almost certainly allow the opponent to surpass you on future turns.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 26 (with the threshold at 37) and the fact that there is still a relatively high chance (over 80%) of drawing a card that will not make you exceed 37, it is generally advisable to take another hit rather than stand on 26. Standing at 26 leaves a substantial opportunity for your opponent to outdraw you.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 30 versus the high threshold of 37, standing now carries a significant risk that the opponent can surpass 30 by continuing to draw. Although there is a 46% chance of exceeding 37 on the next card (and therefore busting), the odds of drawing a card that will keep you in the game (54%) and potentially bring you closer to or exactly at 37 (particularly if you draw a 6 or 7) are relatively favorable. Therefore, hitting is the stronger move in this situation.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Hit\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a threshold of 32 and a current total of only 12, it is typically advantageous to take another card. Standing now would leave you far from 32, giving the opponent a significant opportunity to exceed your total without busting. Hitting at 12 carries relatively low risk of busting and can help you get closer to the threshold for a better chance at winning.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 18 (well below the threshold of 32) and the fact that drawing any single card (max value 13) would not exceed 32, the best move is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Stand\n\nAnswer: Stand","I would choose to Hit in this situation because my total of 13 is far below the threshold of 49, making it quite safe to draw additional cards to increase my total without a high risk of busting.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I choose to take another card given the current total of 25 and a threshold of 49.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Hit is the best move here because you are at 36, and drawing any single card (maximum of 13 points for a King) will not cause you to exceed the threshold of 49.\n\nAnswer: Hit","You currently have a total of 40 with a threshold of 49. Drawing another card has a reasonable chance to improve your total without busting, and likely gives you a better shot at beating the opponent’s final total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the history of the first two rounds, the opponent ended up with a total of 38 both times. Although we do not know their exact total now, they have already stopped drawing (stood) while you are at 42. With a threshold at 49, you are already beating many plausible totals the opponent could have. Hitting runs nearly a 46% risk (cards 8 or above) of exceeding 49, which would result in a certain loss. Standing at 42 is therefore safer, as it likely wins against their probable total.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Hit\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a threshold of 39, your current total is 28. Since only drawing a Q (12) or K (13) would cause you to exceed 39, the chance of busting on the next card is relatively low (2\/13 ≈ 15%). Standing at 28 gives your opponent ample room to surpass you without busting. Therefore, it is generally advantageous to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 33 against a threshold of 39, drawing another card carries a greater than 50% risk of busting (since drawing a 7 or higher would put you over 39). Standing preserves your total of 33, forcing the dealer to either risk going bust or end with a lower total. The safer option in this situation is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","You have already stood on Turn 3, so there is no further action for you to take this turn. When holding 33 against a threshold (N) of 39, drawing another card has a high probability (7\/13) of causing a bust (40 or more). Therefore, standing was a sound choice. You must now wait for your opponent to complete their moves.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the move history, you have already chosen to stand on Turn 3, and according to the rules, once you stand, you cannot take any further actions. Therefore, you have no more moves to make this round, and your total remains at 33.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current total of 4, which is far below the threshold of 39, the most reasonable action is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","You currently have a low total (9) relative to the threshold (39). Barring extremely unusual draws, it is advantageous to continue drawing cards and move closer to 39. Standing now with only 9 would be too conservative and give the opponent a significant advantage. Therefore, the recommended move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 14 against a threshold of 39, it is generally advantageous to continue drawing cards. Standing at 14 leaves too much room for the opponent to surpass your total. Therefore, the recommended move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I recommend taking another card. Your total of 18 is still far enough below 39 to afford at least one more Hit, and the opponent has shown a propensity to go over the threshold in previous rounds.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold of 39 and your current total of 27, it is generally advantageous to draw at least one more card. With a gap of 12 points between your total (27) and the threshold (39), standing now would leave the opponent ample room to surpass 27 without busting. Although there is some risk of drawing a King (which would total 40 and bust), the probability of that happening is relatively low (1\/13 in an infinite deck). Therefore, the best move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I recommend taking another card. Your total of 24 is significantly below the threshold of 35, and there is a relatively low chance (2 out of 13) that the next card will push you over 35 (if you draw a Q or K). On average, hitting should put you closer to 35 than standing on 24, which increases your chances of winning.\n\nAnswer: Hit","It appears you have already exceeded the threshold (36 > 35). Once you exceed N, you cannot improve your situation by adding more cards. Your only hope is if the opponent also goes above 35, which would result in a draw. The strategic choice here is therefore to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the rules and the move history, you already have a total of 36, which exceeds the threshold (35). Once a hand exceeds N, drawing additional cards cannot help: the only chance not to lose outright is if the opponent also exceeds N, resulting in a draw. Since you have already chosen to Stand on Turn 2, there is no further action for you to take. You must remain stood and hope the opponent also busts.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given the current threshold (N = 35), your total is already 36, which exceeds N. Under these rules, if the opponent does not also exceed 35, you will lose; if they do exceed 35, it will be a draw. Because there is no way to reduce your total, there is effectively no benefit to taking another card. You must simply stand and hope your opponent also busts.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Because your total (36) already exceeds the threshold (35), taking another card cannot improve your situation. Your only chance to avoid losing is if your opponent also exceeds 35, resulting in a draw. Therefore, you should continue to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the opponent’s consistent pattern of drawing until they exceed the threshold, the safest strategy here is to stand on 14. Historically, the opponent has overdrawn every single time, so by standing now (with a total under 30), you maximize your chances of winning if\/when the opponent goes over.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the rules and the move history, once you have declared \"Stand,\" you no longer take additional cards in subsequent turns for that round. Therefore, you have no further moves. The opponent will continue according to their strategy.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given the opponent’s past behavior (they have gone over the threshold in every round so far), staying at 14 is a strong choice. The opponent’s pattern indicates they tend to keep hitting aggressively, often exceeding N. By standing, you avoid the risk of busting and force the opponent to draw further. Since N = 30 and you are currently at 14, it is highly likely the opponent will eventually exceed 30 if they continue hitting.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the opponent’s past behavior, they consistently continue hitting until they exceed the threshold. Thus far, they have never stopped below N in any round. Since your total is only 14 and well below the threshold of 30, the safest plan is to continue standing and wait for the opponent to potentially bust again (as they have in previous rounds). \n\nAnswer: Stand","I will take another card because my total of 18 is far below the threshold of 44, leaving substantial room to draw additional cards without exceeding 44.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given your current total of 27 and the threshold of 44, you still have room to safely draw additional cards without exceeding 44 on a single draw (the highest-value card being 13 points for a King). By hitting, you can move closer to 44 and increase your chances of ending with a stronger total than the opponent. Therefore, the best move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","It is currently Turn 3, and your total is 30 with a threshold of 44. Since the highest-value card is 13 (K) and drawing it would bring your total to 43, which is still under 44, it is safe to take another card. Hitting increases the chance to get closer to 44 without exceeding it, improving your odds of winning or drawing rather than standing prematurely at 30.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Stand\n\nAnswer: Stand","With a total of 3 and a high threshold of 42, you have plenty of margin to avoid exceeding 42. Standing now would leave you with a very weak total, so the straightforward choice is to Hit and try to improve your hand.\n\nAnswer: Hit","It’s still early in the hand with a total of only 10, and the threshold is quite high at 42. Standing on 10 would leave you at a very low total relative to the threshold, so the most sensible action is to continue drawing cards to get closer to 42 without exceeding it.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that the threshold is 42 and your current total is only 20, there is ample room to draw another card (even the highest-value card, K=13, would only bring you to 33, safely below 42). Standing at 20 is too low given the opponent can still draw and potentially reach a higher total without busting. Therefore, the best move according to the game situation is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 28 versus the threshold of 42, there is no risk of busting by taking one more card (since even a King worth 13 would bring your total only to 41). Generally, it is advisable to “Hit” when you cannot exceed the threshold with your next card. Therefore, the best move at this stage is to draw another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I would choose to stand. Historically, the opponent consistently goes over the threshold if you do not bust first, so stopping at 40 gives a strong chance to win.  \n\nAnswer: Stand","With a total of 26 (K+K) against a threshold of 30, drawing another card has a high chance of busting (since any card of value 5 or higher will push your total above 30). Meanwhile, your opponent shows a 6 and often follows an aggressive hitting pattern that frequently results in busting. Standing at 26 is therefore the safer option here, hoping the opponent exceeds 30.\n\nAnswer: Stand","With a threshold (N) of 30 and holding a total of 26 (K + K), drawing another card risks busting on anything 5 or higher. Standing at 26 is sensible since the opponent’s visible card is only a 6, and they still need to draw further. Sticking with your stand maximizes your winning chances or a potential draw, because any additional card taken could easily push you over 30.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current situation (your total is 26 with N = 30), drawing another card carries a high risk of exceeding 30 (any card ≥5 will bust you). Because standing leaves the outcome in your opponent’s hands, and you already have 26 (which is reasonably close to 30 without going over), it is statistically safer to remain on 26 than to draw.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the opponent’s past behavior, they have consistently hit aggressively and frequently busted (going over the threshold) in previous rounds. Meanwhile, your total is already 26 (only 4 away from 30), and drawing another card has a high chance of busting (since only A, 2, 3, or 4 would keep you at or under 30). Therefore, it is prudent to remain at 26 and let the opponent continue drawing, as their pattern suggests they are likely to exceed the threshold.\n\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Standing on 7 would give the opponent a strong advantage, so the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the threshold of 39, having a total of 19 is still quite far from 39. Drawing one more card cannot make you bust immediately because the highest-valued card is worth 13 (K), which would bring your total only up to 32. Therefore, it is advantageous to continue hitting to increase your total closer to 39. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 25 and the threshold at 39, you cannot exceed 39 with just one more card (the highest possible card adds 13, giving you 38). Consequently, taking another card is safe and will bring you closer to 39 without risking an immediate bust. It is therefore optimal to continue with a Hit in this situation.\n\nAnswer: Hit","You currently have a total of 29 with a high threshold of 39, and your opponent has already stood. It is quite possible that the opponent’s total already exceeds 29, so standing immediately risks losing. Although there is some chance of busting if you draw a high-value card (J, Q, or K), the threshold of 39 allows enough room (10 points) to improve your total and potentially surpass the opponent. Therefore, the best move here is to take another card (Hit).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 30 against the threshold of 39, standing would likely lose if the opponent is above 30. Hitting carries about a 31% chance of busting (drawing 10, J, Q, or K), but a 69% chance of improving your total without exceeding 39. Given that the opponent has already stood, your best course is to try to get closer to 39 and surpass the opponent’s total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold of 39, holding 31 is not especially close. Since there is still an 8-point gap remaining and the probability of receiving a card of value 8 or lower (which would not cause a bust) is 8\/13, hitting offers a reasonable chance to improve the hand without exceeding 39. Standing on 31 risks losing if the opponent’s total is higher. Therefore, the better move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 32 (with a threshold of 39), standing almost certainly loses if the opponent’s total is 33 or higher but below 40. Hitting gives a 7\/13 chance of drawing a card valued 7 or less (thus reaching 39 or below without busting) and improves the likelihood of beating or tying the opponent’s total. Therefore, the recommended move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a threshold of 49, having a total of 19 leaves a large safe margin before possibly exceeding 49. Therefore, continuing to draw cards to improve your total is generally advisable here. Thus, the recommended move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I have 27 points and the threshold is 49, which leaves a comfortable margin before busting. Therefore, I will Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the high threshold (N = 49), having a total of 31 still leaves ample room before busting. Even if the next card is a high-value face card (worth up to 13 points), that would bring the total to 44, which is still below 49. Therefore, it is generally advantageous to take at least one more card here.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the high threshold (49) and your current total (40), it is generally advantageous to take another card to try and get closer to 49.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 44 (which is only 5 points away from 49), drawing an additional card comes with a high risk of busting (i.e., going over 49). Although there's a possibility of drawing a low-value card (1-5) and reaching a safe total up to 49, the chance of drawing 6 or higher (which would result in an immediate loss) is significantly greater. Therefore, standing is the safer choice.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given the current round’s situation (Threshold N = 49, your total = 44, you have already chosen to stand), there is no further action you can take. You cannot revert a stand, and taking another card is not an option once you have stood. Therefore, the only course of action is to remain standing and await the opponent’s final result.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given the threshold of 36 and your current total of 9, there is ample room to draw more cards without risking an immediate bust. Standing on 9 would almost certainly lose to any reasonable opponent total, so the recommended move is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on a threshold (N) of 36 and your current total of 15, it is generally advisable to keep drawing cards. 15 is far from 36, so the likelihood of exceeding 36 with one additional card is relatively low (even drawing a 13-point card such as a King, Queen, or Jack would only bring your total to 28). Thus, the conventional choice here would be to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 21 versus a threshold of 36, you still have substantial room before risking a bust (which occurs at 37 or above). Since the opponent can also continue drawing cards aiming to get close to 36, standing on 21 would likely be too conservative. It is therefore advisable to continue drawing.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total (33) and the threshold (36), standing at 33 is likely to lose against an opponent who has already chosen to stand (they are probably at or near 36). Although drawing an additional card risks busting, there is still a chance of landing on 34, 35, or 36 and potentially improving the outcome versus a likely higher opponent total. Therefore, the recommended move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 15—far below the threshold of 49—it is generally advantageous to take another card and try to get closer to 49 without busting.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your total is only 26 while the threshold is 49, there is still a substantial gap to 49, which makes it generally favorable to take another card. Standing on 26 might allow the opponent to draw further cards and surpass your total without much risk. Therefore, the recommended move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I have 37 points, which is still significantly below the threshold of 49. Drawing one more card only risks busting if I draw a King (worth 13), which is a 1\/13 chance from an infinite deck. With a strong likelihood of safely improving my total, the best move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I would take another card because there is still enough room between 38 and 49, and drawing any card worth 11 or less will not bust me. Therefore, I would Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I would take another card. Standing at 41 is likely not enough to beat the opponent, given that their strategy often leads them close to the threshold. While there is a risk of busting, the chance of drawing a safe card (1–8) is greater than the risk of drawing 9 or higher. Thus, \"hit\" is the better choice.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 45 (with N = 49), standing would almost certainly lose if the opponent has 46 or more. Although drawing another card risks busting (anything 5 or above causes you to exceed 49), it at least gives a chance (roughly 4 out of 13) of reaching 46–49, which can beat or tie many plausible opponent totals. Therefore, the better play is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I will stand. Hitting here has a very high risk of busting (any draw above 2 makes the total exceed 26), so it is better to stand on 24 and hope the opponent goes over 26 or fails to reach a higher total.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current threshold (N = 26) and your total of 24, the likelihood of drawing a card valued at 2 or less (to reach at most 26) is small compared to the high risk of busting. Since you are already very close to the threshold, standing is typically the safer choice.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Hit\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the threshold of 40 and your current total of 20, standing now would leave a very large gap that the opponent could easily surpass with additional hits. You still have substantial room before potentially exceeding the threshold (another 20 points), so taking at least one more card is a reasonable way to move closer to 40 without being overly risky.  \n\nAnswer: Hit","Hit\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 26, standing would leave us quite far from the threshold of 40, whereas hitting carries a reasonable chance of staying below 40 while getting closer to (and potentially beating) the opponent’s total. Thus, the better play here is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Hit\n\nAnswer: Hit","Hit\n\nAnswer: Hit","Stand\n\nAnswer: Stand","You currently have a total of 22 points, which is well below the threshold of 43, giving you a good margin before risking a bust. Since there is still considerable room to draw additional cards and improve your total, hitting is the more advantageous move compared to standing at only 22.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold of 43 and your current total of 34, drawing another card gives you a 9-in-13 chance (69%) of improving without busting, since only a 10, J, Q, or K (4 out of 13 possibilities) would push your total over 43. Standing at 34 leaves a good chance the opponent will continue hitting and potentially surpass 34 without busting. Therefore, hitting is a reasonable move to try to get closer to 43 and improve your odds of winning.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the rules, your total (46) already exceeds the threshold of 43, which puts you in a busted position. Once you have exceeded N, you cannot reduce your total back below the threshold. Because taking additional cards will not improve your situation, the optimal choice is to Stand and hope that your opponent’s total also exceeds the threshold, resulting in a draw.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the rules and your current total of 46—which already exceeds the threshold of 43—you have effectively busted. Once you exceed N, your only (albeit moot) option is to remain on Stand to see if the opponent also goes over 43. If the opponent does not bust, you lose; if the opponent also exceeds 43, the round is a draw.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the relatively low threshold (25) and your current total of 18, you have enough “room” to draw another card without facing prohibitive bust odds. The opponent, showing a 9 with one unknown card, will likely continue hitting until they approach 25. Standing on 18 gives them a strong chance to surpass your total without busting. Therefore, drawing at least one more card is generally preferable here.\n\nAnswer: Hit","You already have 25, which is exactly the threshold. Hitting would guarantee going over 25, so the best move is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on a threshold of 28 and holding a total of 20, it is generally advisable to take another card rather than stand, since 20 is quite far from 28 and the opponent is likely to continue drawing. Even though there is some risk of busting, the chance of improving your total closer to 28 without going over is substantial enough to justify a hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Stand\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on a threshold (N) of 40 and holding a total of 18, it is generally advantageous to draw additional cards to approach but not exceed N. Standing on 18 would risk allowing the opponent (who still has plenty of room to draw) to surpass your total. Therefore, the best move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the pattern in previous rounds, you are currently at 28 vs. a threshold of 40. Drawing one more card offers a strong chance of landing safely below or on 40 (since only a King, worth 13, would bust you by bringing you to 41). After that, you can reevaluate, but for now, a single hit is a reasonable move to seek a higher total closer to 40. \n\nAnswer: Hit","You currently have a total of 29, which is still relatively far from the threshold of 40. Drawing a new card has a relatively low chance (2 out of 13, given an infinite deck) of causing a bust if you draw a Q or K. Meanwhile, standing on 29 risks losing to an opponent who can easily surpass 29 without exceeding 40. Therefore, the most reasonable move is to continue drawing.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the rules, once you exceed the threshold (N = 40 in this round), you can only hope the opponent also goes over N to force a draw. Taking another card cannot reduce your total, so the strongest move is to stand and hope your opponent busts.\n\nAnswer: Stand","You have already exceeded the threshold (42 > 40), so you are effectively “bust.” Once you stand with a bust total, there is nothing more you can do. Under the rules:\n\n• If the opponent’s final total does not exceed 40, you lose.  \n• If the opponent also exceeds 40, the result is a draw.  \n\nSince you have already chosen to stand on Turn 4, you have no remaining move and must await the opponent’s final outcome.\n\nAnswer: Stand","You have a total of 42, which already exceeds the threshold of 40. Under the rules, once you exceed N you can no longer continue to act (Hit or Stand), and you will lose unless your opponent also exceeds 40 (in which case it would be a draw).

It makes sense to take another card because the likelihood of exceeding 49 with just one or two additional cards is low, and drawing will give you a better chance to end closer to 49 than your opponent.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your total is only 21 and the threshold is 49, you are still far from exceeding the threshold. Drawing additional cards gives you a good chance to get closer to 49 without busting. Consequently, the recommended move at this point is to continue drawing cards. \n\nAnswer: Hit","With a total of 28 against a threshold of 49, you still have substantial room before risking going over 49. Continuing to draw (Hit) increases your chances of getting closer to 49, which should improve your expected outcome against the opponent.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the high threshold (49) and your current total of 30, you have safe room to draw more without immediately risking a bust. Therefore, continuing to hit is advisable to improve the strength of your hand.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I would stop drawing further cards here. Standing on a total of 41 is strong given the high threshold of 49, and drawing another card has a considerable risk (a 5\/13 chance) of busting.  \n\nAnswer: Stand","I recommend taking another card. The threshold of 47 is quite high, and your current total of 14 is still far from 47, so the risk of going bust with a single draw is low, especially when the highest-valued card is 13 (K). Therefore, hitting should give you a stronger total to aim closer to 47.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a threshold of 47 and your current total at only 16, it makes sense to continue drawing cards to move closer to 47 without exceeding it. Therefore, the best move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a threshold of 47 and a current total of only 20, you have ample room to draw additional cards. Busting from 20 is relatively unlikely given the high threshold, and stopping at 20 would leave too much potential for the opponent to surpass you comfortably. Therefore, the optimal move here is to continue and draw another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 31 and the threshold of 47, drawing another card carries no immediate risk of exceeding 47 since the highest card value is 13 (K), which would bring your total to 44. Therefore, it is advantageous to take another card to move closer to the threshold.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 39 versus the threshold of 47, drawing another card carries a significant risk (roughly a 5\/13 chance of busting). Although you could improve your hand if you draw a low-value card (1–8), standing at 39 keeps you safely below the threshold, forcing the opponent—whose strategy appears to involve continuing to hit—to risk busting in pursuit of a higher total. Standing minimizes your chance of an automatic loss from exceeding 47.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current total of 39 and the threshold of 47, you have already chosen to stand on Turn 5. Once you stand, you cannot draw further cards. Therefore, no additional action is possible. The outcome now depends on the opponent’s subsequent draws.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the threshold (N = 38) and your current total (21), standing immediately is risky because the opponent needs only 22 or more to beat 21 (22 is closer to 38 than 21). Meanwhile, you cannot bust on the very next card (the highest single card is worth 13, and 21 + 13 = 34, still under 38). Therefore, it is generally better to take at least one hit here, aiming to raise your total closer to (but not over) 38.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Stand\n\nAnswer: Stand","Stand\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current total of 30 versus a threshold of 38, there is still leeway (8 points) before exceeding the threshold. Although any card 9 or higher causes an immediate bust, the chance of drawing 9 or higher is 5 out of 13 (roughly 38.5%). By drawing, you have about a 61.5% chance to improve your total to somewhere between 31 and 38—which could be strong against the opponent. Standing on 30 is relatively low with respect to a threshold of 38, and the opponent, who already has multiple unknown draws, may easily surpass 30 if they do not bust. \n\nTherefore, from a risk\/reward perspective, it is generally more favorable to draw another card (“Hit”) rather than remain at 30 (“Stand”).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given the current situation, you have already chosen to stand on your total of 16. Once you stand, you cannot take any further actions during this round. It is now the opponent’s turn to continue drawing cards or stand based on their strategy. You simply wait for the outcome based on the opponent’s final total relative to the threshold of 41.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given the opponent’s apparent tendency (from the previous three rounds) to over-hit and exceed the threshold, it makes sense to continue standing on 16 rather than risk drawing further cards. Your total is safely below 41, so the most likely path to victory—based on observed opponent behavior—is to allow them to continue hitting until they bust.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the opponent’s consistent history of drawing aggressively and eventually busting in all previous rounds, continuing to stand on 16 appears advantageous. Under the current threshold (N = 41), your strategy of standing forces the opponent to keep drawing and increases the likelihood they will exceed 41 and lose. Since you have already chosen to stand in the first three turns, maintaining that stance is consistent and should give you the best chance of winning this round.\n\nAnswer: Stand","I would take another card. My total of 23 is still 10 away from the threshold of 33, and drawing one card only risks busting if I draw a J, Q, or K (3 out of 13 ranks). Hitting therefore gives me a good chance (10\/13) to improve my total without exceeding 33.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the rules and current situation, your total is already at 34, which exceeds the threshold (33). Once you exceed the threshold, there is no way to lower your total. Hitting again would only increase your total further, offering no benefit. Although you have effectively busted, there is a possibility the opponent might also exceed the threshold, which would result in a draw. Therefore, your best move is to stand and hope the opponent also exceeds the threshold.\n\nAnswer: stand","You have already exceeded the threshold (33) with a total of 34, so under the rules, you have effectively busted. Once over N, taking additional cards or changing your decision cannot reverse the bust outcome. Therefore, there is no benefit to any further action; you must remain stood and hope the opponent also exceeds N (which would result in a draw). \n\nAnswer: Stand","Given the threshold of 33 and your current total of 34 (which already exceeds the threshold), drawing additional cards cannot improve your situation. By the rules, once you exceed N, you can only hope the opponent also exceeds N in their subsequent moves for a possible draw, but taking a new card will not help you (since you’ve already exceeded N). Therefore, your best move is to stand and await the final outcome.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the opponent’s consistent pattern of hitting until they exceed the threshold (and thereby busting in all previous rounds), the most prudent move at a total of 19 is to Stand. Your opponent is very likely to continue drawing cards, which gives them a high chance of exceeding 45.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given the current round setup—your total is only 19 against a high threshold (45)—your earlier choice to stand means you are no longer drawing cards. Once a player has chosen to stand, they cannot reverse that decision in this game. Since you have already stood on Turn 1, there is no further action for you to take; the round will proceed with the opponent continuing to draw or eventually stand as well. The outcome will be determined once the opponent finishes their turn(s).\n\nAnswer: Stand","You currently have 19, which is far from exceeding the threshold of 45. Meanwhile, your opponent’s strategy so far strongly suggests they will continue taking hits, often pushing their total above the threshold. Since you cannot lose by exceeding 45 if you stand now, and there is a good chance the opponent will eventually bust, standing is the safer (and likely winning) choice.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the given threshold (N = 45) and your current total of 19, you still have substantial room to draw additional cards before risking a bust (exceeding 45). Even if you draw a card with the maximum value (K = 13), you will reach 32, which remains safely under 45. From there, you could decide whether to draw further or stand, depending on how the next card looks. Standing now on 19 gives the opponent a high likelihood of surpassing you. Therefore, the stronger move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on a threshold (N) of 45, having a total of 19 is substantially below that limit, and there is little risk of exceeding 45 with a single additional card. Therefore, continuing to draw more cards (i.e., hitting) is the most reasonable strategy at this point. \n\nAnswer: Hit","A prudent strategy here, given the opponent’s history of continuously hitting and eventually busting, is to Stand immediately on your total of 10. Since the opponent never seems to stand before exceeding the threshold, they are very likely to go over 44 and lose, ensuring your win.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on your opponent’s consistent pattern of overreaching the threshold in every previous round (often continuing to hit and thus exceeding N), the safest strategy here is to maintain your relatively low total (10) and continue standing. By standing, you rely on the likelihood that your opponent will once again draw past 44 and bust, handing you the win.\n\nAnswer: Stand","With a threshold of 44 and a current total of only 10, you have plenty of room before risking a bust. Continuing to draw cards (Hit) gives you a better chance of reaching a competitive total against your opponent. Therefore, the best move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold of 44 and your current total of 10, you are far from exceeding the threshold. Typically, you would want to continue drawing cards until you either approach the threshold or have reason to believe that you can outscore the opponent without risking going over 44. With a total of 10, there is very little immediate risk in drawing another card.\n\nThus, the optimal move here is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your opponent’s consistent behavior in previous rounds (always continuing to hit until they exceed the threshold), the most prudent move here is to stand on 13. By standing immediately, you avoid risking a bust yourself and capitalize on the high likelihood that your opponent will continue drawing past 36. \n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the history of play, your opponent tends to continue hitting aggressively and often goes over the threshold. Here, the threshold is 36 and you are only at 13. Although one might consider hitting to improve the total, maintaining a low total forces the opponent to draw further, increasing the likelihood they will bust beyond 36 (as happened in multiple previous rounds). Since you have already “stood” on Turn 1 and wish to continue applying the same strategy, the best next move is to stand again and wait for your opponent to exceed the threshold.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the opponent’s demonstrated tendency to continue hitting and frequently bust (going over the threshold), and given that your total is only 13 (well below 36), standing and letting the opponent continue to draw remains a strong strategy. If they continue their pattern, they are likely to overshoot 36. Even if the opponent does not bust, the historical trend suggests they rarely stop early enough to avoid going over the threshold. Therefore, the prudent move here is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the history, the opponent’s fixed strategy appears to involve continuing to hit until they exceed the threshold. In every previous round with a similar pattern, the opponent eventually busted. With a total of only 13 and the threshold at 36, your best move is therefore to stand and let the opponent draw themselves beyond 36, resulting in your win.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given your current total of 13 against a threshold of 36, you still have substantial room before risking a bust. Drawing additional cards can improve your total and enhance your chances of winning. Therefore, the sensible move here is to continue by hitting.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Stand\n\nAnswer: Stand","With a current total of only 6 against a threshold of 42, there is substantial room to draw additional cards without risk of immediately exceeding 42. Standing on 6 is extremely unlikely to win unless the opponent severely busts. Therefore, the best move here is to continue taking cards to get closer to 42.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 6 and a threshold (N) of 42, it is advantageous to continue drawing cards. Your total is far from 42, so the probability of busting is low at this stage, and you should aim to improve your total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","You have a very low total (6) compared to the threshold (42), so it makes sense to draw another card rather than stand. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the opponent’s consistent pattern of drawing until they exceed the threshold, it is very likely they will bust again if you simply stop drawing any more cards. Even though your displayed total (6) is currently quite low, every previous round shows that the opponent does not stop below or exactly at N but instead continues until going over. Consequently, the safest play is to stand and allow the opponent to bust.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the history and the current threshold (N=42), your total is only 6. You are far from exceeding 42, and the risk of busting is very low at this point. Continuing to hit gives you a better chance to approach 42 and ultimately outscore the opponent. Therefore, the most reasonable move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the opponent’s consistent pattern of hitting until they exceed the threshold (thus busting), the safest strategy here is to stand on 21. Standing preserves your total well under 46, and given the history, it is highly likely the opponent will continue to draw until they bust. \n\nAnswer: Stand","Stand. Given the opponent’s consistent pattern of over-hitting and our current total of 21 (well below the threshold of 46), it is safest to hold and let the opponent risk exceeding the threshold.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the history, your opponent always continues to hit well past the threshold. In every round they have exceeded N (leading to either your win or a draw in the rarer case both sides go bust). Holding 21 when the threshold is 46 gives you ample room, but the safest approach, following the precedent set in previous rounds, is to stand and let your opponent exceed the threshold yet again.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the high threshold (46) and your current total (21), standing now would leave you far from 46 and at risk of losing if the opponent draws to a higher total without busting. Since you can draw multiple times before exceeding 46 (for example, drawing a 13-point King would only bring you to 34), it is generally advantageous to continue hitting in order to move closer to 46 and improve your chances of winning.\n\nAnswer: Hit"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

You still have plenty of room before exceeding 47, so the risk of busting is very low at this point. Therefore, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a high threshold (N = 47) and a current total of only 18, there is still substantial room to draw additional cards without exceeding 47. This makes it advantageous to continue hitting rather than standing at 18.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total (23) and the high threshold (47), it’s generally advantageous to take another card. Even the highest-value card (13 points) would only bring you to 36, which remains safely below 47. Therefore, continuing to draw further increases your chances of getting closer to 47 without busting.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the threshold of 47, your current total is 35, which is still 12 points below the limit. You will only exceed 47 if you draw a K (worth 13). Since that is just 1 out of 13 possible ranks, the probability of busting on the next draw is relatively low (approximately 7.7%). In contrast, drawing any other card either improves your total or brings you closer to 47 without surpassing it. Thus, it is advantageous to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Stand\n\nAnswer: Stand","You have already stood on your previous turn, so you cannot take another action. Your best (and only) move at this point is to remain standing and let the opponent conclude their turn and the round.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on your current total of 3 (A=1, 2=2), you are far from exceeding the threshold of 41. Generally, you would want to continue drawing cards to get closer to 41 without going over. Since you only have 3 points, standing would almost certainly result in a total that is too low to beat your opponent. Hence, you should “Hit” on your first turn.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a total of 9 and a high threshold of 41, it is generally advantageous to keep drawing cards. Standing at 9 would put you at a significant disadvantage unless you have strong reason to believe your opponent might bust or already has a weak total. Therefore, the best move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I would continue drawing cards because 14 is far from the threshold of 41, and standing at just 14 is very likely to lose against an opponent who has already stood. Hence, the best move here is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a total of only 15 versus a threshold of 41, there is no risk of busting by drawing a single card (since the highest-value card is 13, and 15 + 13 = 28, which is still below 41). In fact, even two cards totaling 26 would bring the total to 41 exactly, which does not exceed the threshold. Therefore, continuing to draw is advantageous in order to approach 41 and maximize the chance of beating the opponent’s unknown total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a total of 18 and an N of 41, there is still a comfortable margin before busting. Drawing another card cannot immediately exceed 41 (even if you draw a King\/Q\/J worth 13\/12\/11, you would reach at most 31). Therefore, it is statistically advantageous to continue hitting to get closer to 41 rather than stand on 18, which is quite far from the threshold.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a threshold of 41, your total of 22 is relatively low, leaving ample room to draw without exceeding 41. Because the opponent stood early, they may already have a competitive total. To improve your chances of getting closer to (but not over) 41, continuing to draw is generally favorable. Therefore, the recommended move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I would choose to stand here. With a total of 35 and a threshold of 41, the chance of drawing a card worth 7 or more (which would bust your hand) is slightly over half. Standing with 35 gives you a fair chance that the dealer’s total is lower or that you at least push if they also have 35, rather than risking an immediate loss by exceeding 41.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Hit  \nAnswer: Hit","With a threshold of 40, a total of 21 is still relatively low. Because even the highest-value single card (K=13) added to 21 results in 34, which does not exceed 40, it is generally advisable to continue drawing in order to approach or get closer to 40. Stopping at 21 would likely give the opponent room to surpass your total without busting. Therefore, the better move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given your current total of 32 versus the threshold of 40, standing at 32 is quite risky because the opponent is likely to surpass 32 without busting. Drawing another card carries about a 38% chance to bust (if you draw 9, 10, J, Q, or K) and about a 62% chance to improve your total to 33–40, which is more competitive. Therefore, it is generally preferable to take a Hit rather than Stand.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the rules, any additional card (including an Ace, worth 1) would push your total above 40, causing you to exceed N and lose if the opponent does not also exceed N. Therefore, the sensible choice is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Hit\n\nAnswer: Hit","I recommend asking for another card (Hit). Because your total is 31 and the threshold is 39, you still have a reasonable window of up to 8 points before exceeding 39, making an additional card likely worthwhile.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I will Stand. With a total of 38 against a threshold of 39, drawing another card has a very high chance of causing a bust (any card other than an Ace will exceed 39). Therefore, the optimal move here is to stand and hope the opponent either goes over the limit or ends with a lower total.\n\nAnswer: Stand","I will take another card to move closer to the threshold of 27. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total (20) and the threshold of 27, you still have 7 points of “safe” space before busting. Although there is some risk of immediately exceeding 27 if you draw 8 or higher, remaining on 20 would leave you in a relatively weak position against an opponent who could easily surpass 20 by continuing to hit. Given that both sides busting results in a draw (rather than a loss for you), it is generally better here to be more aggressive to improve your total. Therefore, the recommended move is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","You have exceeded the threshold with a total of 33 against N=27. Once over the threshold, you automatically lose unless the opponent also exceeds it, resulting in a draw. Because drawing more cards cannot reduce your total, the best move is to stand and hope your opponent surpasses the threshold on their turn.\n\nAnswer: Stand","You have already exceeded the threshold (27) with a total of 33. In this game’s rules, once you exceed N, you can only hope the opponent also exceeds N (resulting in a draw). Taking another card cannot reduce your total; thus, there is no strategic benefit to hitting. You should simply stand and await the opponent’s final total.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the rules, you already have a total of 33, which exceeds the threshold of 27. Once a hand exceeds N (=27), you have effectively busted unless the opponent also goes over 27. Since taking another card cannot reduce your total, and you have already stood in previous turns, the only remaining possibility for a non-losing outcome is if the opponent also exceeds 27. Therefore, your best (and only) move at this point is to remain standing and hope the opponent busts as well.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the high threshold (47) and your relatively low total (15), there is virtually no downside to drawing another card at this stage. Even the highest-value card (K=13) would bring your total only to 28, which is still far below 47 and safe from busting. Therefore, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a Threshold of 47 and a current total of 19, you still have substantial room before risking a bust. Based on the opponent’s observed tendency to draw closer to N − 2 or N − 3, standing at 19 would likely be too low to compete. Therefore, the better strategic choice is to continue drawing in order to improve your total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a total of 31 against a threshold of 47, there is a comfortable margin to safely draw another card and improve your hand without risking an immediate bust. Therefore, the best move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold (N=47) and your current total (43), the probability of busting if you draw another card is quite high (any card of value 5 or more would cause you to exceed 47). Although the opponent may continue to draw, standing at 43 minimizes your chance of an immediate bust and forces the opponent to catch up without going over 47. Therefore, the best move here is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","From the current situation (43 out of 47), drawing another card has a high chance of busting (any draw of 5 or more would exceed 47). Standing on 43 is therefore the safer strategy. \n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current total of 10 versus a threshold of 34, you still have plenty of room before risking going over 34. Historically, with a high threshold, continuing to draw until you reach a value closer to (but not exceeding) that threshold is a common strategy. Therefore, the advisable move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 14 and a threshold of 34, you are still relatively far from risking a bust, and drawing another card could help you get closer to 34 for a stronger final total. Therefore, the best move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold of 34 and your current total of 21, drawing one more card cannot exceed 34 (max single-card value is 13). It is therefore safe and advantageous to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I would stand. With a total of 30 and a threshold of 34, drawing another card carries a high risk of busting (since any card ≥5 would exceed the threshold). Standing here maximizes the chance that the opponent might bust or fail to reach 31–34.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given the threshold of 38 and a current total of 14, it is generally wise to continue drawing to approach 38 without exceeding it. Therefore, the most reasonable move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold of 38 and having only a total of 15 at present, it is generally advantageous to take another card rather than stand so far from 38. Therefore, hitting is the more strategic choice to aim for a closer total without immediately risking an excessive overshoot.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 26 versus the threshold of 38, it is statistically advantageous to take another card. The chance of immediately busting is relatively low (only drawing a value of 13 immediately breaks 38), and drawing anything from 1 to 12 keeps you at or under 38, which offers a better position against an opponent likely aiming for a total in the mid-30s. Therefore, the recommended move for this turn is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I recommend standing here. Your total is 33, and drawing has a high probability of busting given the infinite deck. Standing forces your opponent to either exceed the threshold or end up with a lower total.\n\nAnswer: Stand","You currently have a total of 33 with a threshold of 38. Drawing another card carries a high risk of exceeding 38 (any draw of 6 or more will bust you). Statistically, that is 8 out of the 13 possible ranks (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K) leading to a bust, which is more than a 60% chance. Therefore, the prudent move is to remain at 33 and hope that the opponent goes over 38 or ends with a total lower than yours.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given your total is 33 and the threshold is 38, drawing another card risks busting if its value is 6 or higher. Since you have already stood (and remain below 38), continuing to stand is prudent. Your opponent must now continue playing until they either stand or exceed 38.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on your current total of 33 versus the threshold of 38, drawing another card carries a high risk of busting (any card 6 or higher will exceed 38). Standing preserves your total of 33, letting the opponent continue to hit and risk exceeding 38 themselves. Therefore, the most prudent move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","With such a high threshold (44) and a current total of only 10, it is generally advantageous to take additional cards. The likelihood of going bust on the next few draws is very low, given that the highest-value card (K) would only add 13, bringing the total to 23, which is still well below 44. Therefore, it makes sense to Hit. \n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 18 and the threshold of 44, there is no risk of going bust by drawing a single additional card (the maximum card value is 13, which would bring you only to 31). Therefore, it is advantageous to continue drawing in order to move closer to 44.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on a threshold of 44 and your current total of 28, you still have a buffer of up to 16 points before exceeding 44. Even with the highest-value card (K = 13) drawn next, you would reach 41 (still below 44). Standing at 28 would likely give the opponent too large a window to surpass your total without busting. Therefore, the safer choice is to continue and draw another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the threshold (N = 44) and your current total of 37, drawing another card has a 6\/13 chance of causing a bust (drawing 8 or higher). Although there is a 7\/13 chance of improving your total without busting, the nearly 46% bust risk is quite significant. Standing on 37 often proves safer when the threshold is 44, especially since the opponent still has cards to draw and may risk exceeding the threshold or ending on a lower total.\n\nAnswer: Stand","I currently have a total of 14 against a threshold of 32, which leaves me with plenty of room to draw more cards without immediately risking a bust. Standing at 14 would be weak, as the opponent could easily surpass this total. Therefore, the better move is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","You currently have 20 against a threshold of 32, which leaves enough room to safely draw another card without a high chance of exceeding N. Based on the game rules and your total, it is advisable to “Hit.”\n\nAnswer: Hit","Stand\n\nAnswer: Stand","It is very risky to draw another card because you would bust with any draw of 3 or higher (which is the majority of possible cards). Standing on a total of 30 is therefore the safest and most sensible option.\n\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Therefore, it is advantageous to continue drawing cards to get closer to 43.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the high threshold (N = 43) and your current total of 30, you still have room to draw without immediately risking a bust (since even a King worth 13 would bring you exactly to 43, which does not exceed N). Standing on 30 gives the opponent ample room to surpass your total. Therefore, continuing to “Hit” is the better choice now.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a total of 36, drawing another card carries a nearly 46% chance (6 out of 13) of immediately exceeding 43 (since any card ≥ 8 would bust). While standing on 36 does not guarantee a win, pushing your total any higher is risky. Consequently, the safer play here is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","You have already chosen to Stand on your previous turn. There are no further actions for you to take on Turn 4; it is now the opponent’s turn. Once the opponent finishes their turn (either by standing or by exceeding the threshold), the round will be settled according to the rules:\n\n• If the opponent exceeds 43 and you do not, you win.  \n• If both sides exceed 43, it is a draw.  \n• If neither side exceeds 43, the side closest to 43 wins (or a draw if totals are equal).\n\nSince you have a total of 36 and have stood, your final move remains Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","With a total of 36 against a threshold N = 43, drawing an additional card would risk going over 43 on any draw of 8 or higher. You have already declared \"stand\" and it’s generally optimal to remain standing here, since the chance of busting is significant with any larger card. Therefore, no further action should be taken.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given that the threshold is 40 and your total is only 18, there is ample room to add more points without risking an immediate bust. You are far from 40, so it is generally advantageous to continue drawing cards to improve your total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a hand totaling 30 against a threshold of 40, there is still room to draw without an overwhelming risk of busting (only face cards—J, Q, K—would exceed 40). Drawing one more card statistically favors moving closer to 40, which strengthens the position compared to standing at 30.\n\nAnswer: Hit","You currently have a total of 33, which is 7 points below the threshold of 40. Drawing a card of value 8 or higher would put you over 40 and cause you to lose automatically, but there are 7 card values (A=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) that would keep you safely at or below 40, and 6 card values (8, 9, 10, J=11, Q=12, K=13) that would cause a bust. Because you're still 7 away from the threshold, it can be worth the risk to attempt getting closer to 40 (the alternative is standing at 33, which is not very strong if your opponent continues to draw).\n\nTherefore, the recommended move here is to take another card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I recommend standing on 38, because drawing another card carries a high probability of exceeding 40. \n\nAnswer: Stand","Given your current total of 38 and the threshold of 40, drawing another card risks exceeding the threshold (because only a 1 or 2 would keep you at or under 40). Thus, standing at 38 is statistically the safest move.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given the threshold is fairly high (29) and your current total is only 12, you have significant room to draw additional cards without busting. Standing at 12 would be risky because your opponent’s current known value (12 + unknown) is already on par with yours and they have not yet had to draw. Therefore, it is generally advantageous for you to Hit in this situation.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given the threshold is 29 and your current total is 19, there is still significant room to improve without exceeding 29. Drawing a new card carries about a 23% chance of busting (if you draw J, Q, or K), but a 77% chance of improving your total. Hitting could bring you closer to 29 or even match it exactly (drawing a 10 would yield 29), thus maximizing your potential to outscore the opponent. Therefore, the recommended move is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that you have a total of 24 and that drawing a 6 or higher would cause you to exceed the threshold of 29, the chances of busting if you take another card are greater than 50%. Standing at 24 forces your opponent to try to beat this total under the threshold. Therefore, the safer (and likely optimal) move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on your current total of 13 versus a threshold of 35, it is more advantageous to take another card and attempt to get closer to 35, rather than standing at 13.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold of 35 and the fact that you currently have 21 (and thus cannot bust with one more card, since the highest card value is 13 and 21 + 13 = 34), it is advantageous to take another card and get closer to 35. Therefore, the best move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold (N = 35) and your current total of 22, drawing another card cannot cause you to exceed 35 on this draw (the highest-value card is 13, which would bring you exactly to 35). Therefore, continuing to Hit is a safe move to improve your total and increase your chances of winning.\n\nAnswer: Hit","It is usually advantageous to continue drawing if your current total (26) is still significantly below the threshold (35) and the opponent has chosen to stand—which may imply they have a total that could be higher than 26. With a 69.23% chance (9 out of 13 card values) of safely hitting without busting, drawing another card maximizes your chance to reach a more competitive total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current board state and the high likelihood of busting with another draw (since only an Ace would keep the total at or below 35), the safer move is to stand on 34.\n\nAnswer: Stand","With a total of only 6 against a threshold of 37, it is very safe to continue drawing cards to increase your total. Standing at 6 would almost certainly lose because the opponent can easily surpass that total without exceeding 37. Therefore, the best action here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","With a total of 12 against a threshold of 37, there is significant leeway to draw more cards without busting. Historically, you have successfully drawn additional cards to reach a stronger total. Standing now with only 12 would leave you at a weak total relative to the threshold. Therefore, the optimal move at this point is to hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on a threshold (N) of 37 and holding a total of only 14, it is generally advisable to continue drawing cards. You still have a substantial margin (23 points) before reaching 37, so the risk of busting is relatively low compared to the potential gain of improving your total. Therefore, the recommended move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I would choose to draw another card because the threshold is still far above my current total of 16, giving me room to improve my hand without risking an immediate bust.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 26 against a threshold of 37, it is generally advantageous to draw another card to move closer to 37. The chance to exceed 37 on the next draw is relatively small (only if you draw a Queen or King, which is 2 out of 13 ranks), so the risk is outweighed by the potential benefit of improving your total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the pattern of your opponent frequently busting with an aggressive hitting strategy, and given that drawing another card at 31 has a high risk (more than a 50% chance) of pushing you over 37, a prudent choice here is to Stand. Holding at 31 may allow your opponent to continue hitting and potentially exceed the threshold again, resulting in another win for you.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current total of 15 and the high threshold of 29, drawing another card is safe because even the highest-value card (K = 13) would take you to 28, which is still under 29. Therefore, the best move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 27 and a threshold of 29, the likelihood of safely drawing a low-value card (Ace or 2) is quite small (2 out of 13 possible card ranks). Hitting has a high risk of pushing you over 29. Standing at 27 forces the opponent to act, and given that you are close to 29, standing is generally the safer move.\n\nAnswer: Stand","You currently have a total of 27 against a threshold of 29. Drawing another card risks exceeding the threshold with high probability (only A or 2 would keep you safe). Therefore, the more prudent move is to stand, aiming to stay below 29.  \n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on your current total of 27 against a threshold of 29, drawing another card risks a very high probability of busting (any draw of 3 or higher would exceed 29). The safer play is to stand and hope the opponent exceeds the threshold on their turn or finishes with a lower total.\n\nAnswer: Stand","You currently have a total of 14 against a threshold of 38, which is far from exceeding the threshold. It is generally safer to draw another card in this situation rather than stand so early.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold of 38, a total of 18 is significantly lower than the limit, leaving ample room to draw additional cards without immediately risking a bust. Standing at 18 against an opponent who can potentially continue to draw closer to 38 would be disadvantageous. Therefore, it is generally preferable to take another card in hopes of improving the total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total (27) versus the threshold (38), you still have 11 points of safe “space” before busting. The probability of immediately busting on your next draw is limited to drawing a Q or K (2 out of 13 possible ranks), which is relatively small. Meanwhile, improving your total beyond 27 provides a stronger position should the opponent avoid busting. Therefore, taking another card (Hit) is a reasonable choice here.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 37 (which is only 1 point below the threshold of 38), taking an additional card poses a very high risk of exceeding the threshold (since only an Ace, worth 1, would avoid busting). Therefore, the optimal move is to stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","I would stand in this situation. Drawing another card with a total of 37 against a threshold of 38 is too risky because almost any card other than an Ace would cause me to exceed N. By standing, I preserve my total of 37 and force the opponent to continue or stand with unknown cards, which gives me a reasonable chance of winning without the high probability of busting.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the current situation, you have already reached a total of 37 out of a threshold of 38. Drawing another card in hopes of exactly 1 point (which would be an Ace) is too risky given the much higher chance of drawing a 2 or greater and busting. Therefore, the prudent move is to continue standing and let the opponent finish their turn.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Given the high threshold (N = 50) and our current total of 14, we still have a lot of room before risking a bust. Standing at 14 would be overly conservative, especially since the opponent’s visible card is 10 and they can likely draw closer to 50. Therefore, the best move here is to “Hit.”\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given your current total of 25 versus a relatively high threshold of 50, you can safely take additional cards without risking an immediate bust. Historically, your opponent tends to draw aggressively and often goes over the threshold. By hitting now, you can improve your total closer to 50, aiming to outlast or force the opponent to bust.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 28 against a threshold of 50, you still have considerable room to draw additional cards without risking an immediate bust. Therefore, it is generally advantageous to continue drawing in order to improve your total.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your current total is 32 and the threshold is 50, even the highest-value draw (13 points for a K) would leave you at 45, which does not exceed 50. Therefore, hitting is safe for at least one more card and gives you a chance to approach 50 more closely, increasing the likelihood of winning (or the opponent busting).\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on your current total of 36 and the threshold of 50, drawing another card is safe because even the highest-value card (K=13) would bring you to 49, which remains below the threshold. Therefore, continuing with a Hit is a reasonable choice to try to get as close to 50 as possible without going over.\n\nAnswer: Hit","I would stop at 48 rather than risk busting. Standing is safer given the narrow margin to the threshold and the high likelihood of drawing a card worth 3 or more and exceeding 50.\n\nAnswer: Stand","I have 17, and the threshold is 47. That leaves me a large margin before busting, and given the opponent’s pattern of aggressive hitting (often leading to their own bust), it makes sense to accumulate more points safely. Therefore, I will Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 19 and the high threshold of 47, you are still far from risking a bust. It is generally advantageous to take another card and try to improve your total, aiming to get closer to 47 without exceeding it.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the current total of 28 and a threshold (N) of 47, there is ample room before exceeding the threshold. Drawing another card is a relatively safe move to get closer to 47 and maximize the chance of winning. Therefore, it is advisable to continue by requesting an additional card.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the history, the opponent consistently continues hitting until they exceed the threshold, resulting in a bust every round. With your hand already totaling 32—well below the threshold of 47—standing now avoids any risk of busting yourself and forces your opponent (who appears to keep hitting) to face a high likelihood of going over 47 again. Therefore, the best move here is to Stand.\n\nAnswer: Stand","You currently have a total of 32, which is significantly below the threshold of 47. Since even the highest-value card (K = 13) would bring your total only to 45, you cannot exceed 47 with your next draw. Therefore, the better move is to take another card to try to get closer to 47.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Given that your total is 32 and the threshold is 47, you cannot exceed 47 by drawing exactly one more card (since the maximum card value is 13, and 32 + 13 = 45). Therefore, it is safe to draw another card to try to get closer to 47.  \n\nAnswer: Hit","Given your current total of 32 and a threshold of 47, drawing one more card cannot immediately cause you to bust since the highest-value card is 13 (which would bring you to 45). This still leaves you under 47, giving you a higher total and reducing the chance that the opponent can beat you without going over. Hence, the optimal move here is to Hit.\n\nAnswer: Hit","Based on the threshold of 37 and holding a total of 19, the conservative and likely winning move is to Stand. Historically, your opponent has consistently drawn beyond the threshold and busted. By standing at 19, you avoid risking a bust from multiple hits and put the onus on the opponent to come closer to 37 (which, from previous rounds, they often fail to do). \n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the previous rounds, your opponent consistently hits until they exceed the threshold and bust. Since you already have 19 and the threshold is 37, you are in a favorable position. Standing makes sense because the opponent is likely to continue drawing cards and exceed 37, as they have done in almost every prior round. Having chosen “stand” on Turn 1, you have no further moves, and you simply wait to see if the opponent busts again.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the opponent’s past behavior, they consistently overdraw and bust. Your total is 19 against a threshold of 37, which is safely below the limit but leaves plenty of room for the opponent to overshoot. Standing again appears to be the wisest move, keeping your stable total while allowing the opponent’s aggressive hitting to push them over 37.\n\nAnswer: Stand","Based on the opponent’s demonstrated tendency to keep hitting until they overshoot the threshold, your safest strategy here is to Stand again and force them to continue drawing. Even though 19 is far below 37, the opponent’s pattern (often going over the limit) suggests it is more advantageous to let them risk busting rather than increase your own risk by drawing more cards.\n\nAnswer: Stand"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
