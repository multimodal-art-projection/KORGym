Hmm, the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji that are of length 2 or more on this board. So, each line can be horizontal (same row) or vertical (same column), and the line must consist of the same emoji repeated. Also, lines longer than 2 count as multiple lines? Or do they count as one? Wait, the problem says \"length of 2 or more\" and \"total count of such lines\". So I think that each consecutive sequence of the same emoji in a row or column counts once if its length is at least 2. For example, if there's a sequence of 3 in a row, that's one line. But wait, some might count overlapping sequences. Wait no, the standard way for these problems is that each maximal consecutive sequence of 2 or more counts as one. But wait, the problem statement says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". So a line of length 3 would contribute one line (since it's a single line of length 3), not two (like 2+1). So for a horizontal line, we check each row, and look for consecutive runs of the same emoji. Each run of 2 or more counts as one line. Similarly for vertical lines in each column.\n\nSo the plan is: for each row, scan each possible consecutive sequence and count how many runs of 2 or more. Do the same for each column. Then sum all those counts.\n\nNow, let's look at the input. The board is a 10x10 grid (since there are 10 rows, each with 10 emojis). Let's process each row first.\n\nFirst, process each row:\n\nFor each row, iterate from left to right, track the current emoji and the current run length. When the emoji changes, if the previous run was >=2, increment the count. Then reset the current run. Also, after processing the row, check if the last run was >=2.\n\nSame for columns: for each column, iterate from top to bottom, same logic.\n\nSo, let's start with the first row.\n\nRow 1: 🌼🐋🥀🚀🐚🚀🌳🐚🥀🚀\n\nLooking at each element:\n\nPositions 0-9 (assuming 0-based index):\n\n0: 🌼\n\n1: 🐋 (different, so check previous run. Run was 1, which is <2. So no count. Reset to 🐋, count=1.\n\n2: 🥀 (different. Run was 1. No count. Reset to 🥀, count=1.\n\n3: 🚀 (different. Run 1. No. Reset, count=1.\n\n4: 🐚 (different. Run 1. Reset, count=1.\n\n5: 🚀 (different. Previous run was 1. No count. Now current is 🚀, count=1.\n\nWait, perhaps I should go step by step:\n\nLet's track the current emoji and the current count.\n\nRow 1:\n\nElements: 🌼, 🐋, 🥀, 🚀, 🐚, 🚀, 🌳, 🐚, 🥀, 🚀.\n\nStart with current = 🌼, count=1.\n\nNext element (1) is 🐋. Different. So check if count >=2? Current count is 1. So no. Reset to 🐋, count=1.\n\nElement 2: 🥀. Different. Check count 1: no. Reset to 🥀, count=1.\n\nElement3: 🚀. Different. Check 1: no. Reset to 🚀, count=1.\n\nElement4: 🐚. Different. Check 1: no. Reset to 🐚, count=1.\n\nElement5: 🚀. Different. Check 1: no. Reset to 🚀, count=1.\n\nElement6: 🌳. Different. Check 1: no. Reset to 🌳, count=1.\n\nElement7: 🐚. Different. Check 1: no. Reset to 🐚, count=1.\n\nElement8: 🥀. Different. Check 1: no. Reset to 🥀, count=1.\n\nElement9: 🚀. Different. Check 1: no. So after processing all elements, there's a count of 1 for the last element, but no run. So row 1 has 0 horizontal lines.\n\nSo row1 contributes 0.\n\nRow2: 🐚🌳🌳🌼🐫🥀🌳🌼🦔🌼\n\nLet's process this row.\n\nElements: 🐚, 🌳, 🌳, 🌼, 🐫, 🥀, 🌳, 🌼, 🦔, 🌼.\n\nStart with current = 🐚, count=1.\n\nElement1: 🌳. Different. Count 1. So no. Reset to 🌳, count=1.\n\nElement2: 🌳. Same. count=2. Continue.\n\nElement3: 🌼. Different. Current run is 2. So increment horizontal count by 1. Now reset to 🌼, count=1.\n\nElement4: 🐫. Different. Count 1: no. Reset to 🐫, count=1.\n\nElement5: 🥀. Different. Count 1: no. Reset to 🥀, count=1.\n\nElement6: 🌳. Different. Count 1: no. Reset to 🌳, count=1.\n\nElement7: 🌼. Different. Count 1: no. Reset to 🌼, count=1.\n\nElement8: 🦔. Different. Count1: no. Reset to 🦔, count=1.\n\nElement9: 🌼. Different. Count1: no. So after processing, the last run is 1. So in this row, there's a run of 2 in positions 1-2 (🌳🌳). So row2 contributes 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow3: 🐋🥀🐫🐫🥀🐚🦩🥀🦩🌳\n\nElements: 🐋, 🥀, 🐫, 🐫, 🥀, 🐚, 🦩, 🥀, 🦩, 🌳.\n\nCurrent: 🐋, count=1.\n\nElement1: 🥀. Different. Count 1: no. Reset, count=1.\n\nElement2: 🐫. Different. Count1: no. Reset, count=1.\n\nElement3: 🐫. Same. count=2.\n\nElement4: 🥀. Different. Count was 2. Increment count by 1. Then reset to 🥀, count=1.\n\nSo here, the run of 🐫🐫 (positions 2-3) contributes 1.\n\nThen, element4 is 🥀, count=1.\n\nElement5: 🐚. Different. Count1: no. Reset to 🐚, count=1.\n\nElement6: 🦩. Different. Count1: no. Reset, count=1.\n\nElement7: 🥀. Different. Count1: no. Reset to 🥀, count=1.\n\nElement8: 🦩. Different. Count1: no. Reset to 🦩, count=1.\n\nElement9: 🌳. Different. Count1: no. So row3 contributes 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow4: 🦔🦩🐫🌼🐋🌼🌳🐋🐋🐋\n\nElements: 🦔, 🦩, 🐫, 🌼, 🐋, 🌼, 🌳, 🐋, 🐋, 🐋.\n\nLooking for runs.\n\nCurrent: 🦔, count=1.\n\nElement1: 🦩. Different. Count1: no. Reset, count=1.\n\nElement2: 🐫. Different. Count1: no. Reset, count=1.\n\nElement3: 🌼. Different. Count1: no. Reset, count=1.\n\nElement4: 🐋. Different. Count1: no. Reset, count=1.\n\nElement5: 🌼. Different. Count1: no. Reset, count=1.\n\nElement6: 🌳. Different. Count1: no. Reset, count=1.\n\nElement7: 🐋. Different. Count1: no. Reset, count=1.\n\nElement8: 🐋. Same. count=2.\n\nElement9: 🐋. Same. count=3.\n\nAfter processing, end of row. Check if count >=2. Here, the last run is 3. So this contributes 1 horizontal line. So row4 contributes 1.\n\nRow5: 🚀🥀🐫🌳🌳🌼🥀🐫🌳🐚\n\nElements: 🚀, 🥀, 🐫, 🌳, 🌳, 🌼, 🥀, 🐫, 🌳, 🐚.\n\nCheck runs.\n\nCurrent: 🚀, count=1.\n\nElement1: 🥀. Different. Count1: no. Reset, count=1.\n\nElement2: 🐫. Different. Count1: no. Reset, count=1.\n\nElement3: 🌳. Different. Count1: no. Reset, count=1.\n\nElement4: 🌳. Same. count=2. So here's a run.\n\nElement5: 🌼. Different. So count the run of 2. Increment horizontal count. Now reset to 🌼, count=1.\n\nElement6: 🥀. Different. Count1: no. Reset to 🥀, count=1.\n\nElement7: 🐫. Different. Count1: no. Reset, count=1.\n\nElement8: 🌳. Different. Count1: no. Reset, count=1.\n\nElement9: 🐚. Different. Count1: no. So row5 has one horizontal line (🌳🌳). So row5 contributes 1.\n\nRow6: 🥀🐚🌳🥀🌼🥀🐋🥀🐚🐫\n\nElements: 🥀, 🐚, 🌳, 🥀, 🌼, 🥀, 🐋, 🥀, 🐚, 🐫.\n\nCheck runs.\n\nCurrent: 🥀, count=1.\n\nElement1: 🐚. Different. Count1: no. Reset, count=1.\n\nElement2: 🌳. Different. Count1: no. Reset, count=1.\n\nElement3: 🥀. Different. Count1: no. Reset, count=1.\n\nElement4: 🌼. Different. Count1: no. Reset, count=1.\n\nElement5: 🥀. Different. Count1: no. Reset, count=1.\n\nElement6: 🐋. Different. Count1: no. Reset, count=1.\n\nElement7: 🥀. Different. Count1: no. Reset, count=1.\n\nElement8: 🐚. Different. Count1: no. Reset, count=1.\n\nElement9: 🐫. Different. Count1: no. So no runs in row6. So row6 contributes 0.\n\nRow7: 🌳🦔🌼🐋🐚🚀🐋🚀🦩🐚\n\nElements: 🌳, 🦔, 🌼, 🐋, 🐚, 🚀, 🐋, 🚀, 🦩, 🐚.\n\nCurrent: 🌳, count=1.\n\nElement1: 🦔. Different. Count1: no. Reset, count=1.\n\nElement2: 🌼. Different. Count1: no. Reset, count=1.\n\nElement3: 🐋. Different. Count1: no. Reset, count=1.\n\nElement4: 🐚. Different. Count1: no. Reset, count=1.\n\nElement5: 🚀. Different. Count1: no. Reset, count=1.\n\nElement6: 🐋. Different. Count1: no. Reset, count=1.\n\nElement7: 🚀. Different. Count1: no. Reset, count=1.\n\nElement8: 🦩. Different. Count1: no. Reset, count=1.\n\nElement9: 🐚. Different. Count1: no. So row7 contributes 0.\n\nRow8: 🐫🌳🌳🚀🚀🦩🌳🥀🦔🥀\n\nElements: 🐫, 🌳, 🌳, 🚀, 🚀, 🦩, 🌳, 🥀, 🦔, 🥀.\n\nCheck runs.\n\nCurrent: 🐫, count=1.\n\nElement1: 🌳. Different. Count1: no. Reset to 🌳, count=1.\n\nElement2: 🌳. Same. count=2. So this is a run.\n\nElement3: 🚀. Different. So count this run. Increment. Reset to 🚀, count=1.\n\nElement4: 🚀. Same. count=2. \n\nElement5: 🦩. Different. So count this run. Now two runs so far in this row.\n\nThen reset to 🦩, count=1.\n\nElement6: 🌳. Different. Count1: no. Reset to 🌳, count=1.\n\nElement7: 🥀. Different. Count1: no. Reset to 🥀, count=1.\n\nElement8: 🦔. Different. Count1: no. Reset, count=1.\n\nElement9: 🥀. Same. count=2. After processing, check this run. So this would be another run.\n\nWait, let's go step by step:\n\nElement0: 🐫 → count=1.\n\nElement1: 🌳 → different. count1 → no. Reset to 🌳, count=1.\n\nElement2: 🌳 → same → count=2. No change yet.\n\nElement3: 🚀 → different. So run of 2 → increment count by 1. Now, row8 has 1. Reset to 🚀, count=1.\n\nElement4: 🚀 → same → count=2.\n\nElement5: 🦩 → different. Run of 2 → increment count (now 2). Reset to 🦩, count=1.\n\nElement6: 🌳 → different. count1 → no. Reset to 🌳, count=1.\n\nElement7: 🥀 → different. count1 → no. Reset to 🥀, count=1.\n\nElement8: 🦔 → different. count1 → no. Reset to 🦔, count=1.\n\nElement9: 🥀 → same → count=2. End of row. So run of 2 → increment count (now 3).\n\nSo row8 has 3 horizontal lines. So row8 contributes 3.\n\nRow9: 🐚🥀🐋🐋🦔🐚🐫🐫🌼🌳\n\nElements: 🐚, 🥀, 🐋, 🐋, 🦔, 🐚, 🐫, 🐫, 🌼, 🌳.\n\nProcessing:\n\nCurrent: 🐚, count=1.\n\nElement1: 🥀 → different. count1 → no. Reset to 🥀, count=1.\n\nElement2: 🐋 → different. count1 → no. Reset to 🐋, count=1.\n\nElement3: 🐋 → same → count=2.\n\nElement4: 🦔 → different. Run of 2 → increment count (1). Reset to 🦔, count=1.\n\nElement5: 🐚 → different. count1 → no. Reset to 🐚, count=1.\n\nElement6: 🐫 → different. count1 → no. Reset to 🐫, count=1.\n\nElement7: 🐫 → same → count=2.\n\nElement8: 🌼 → different. Run of 2 → increment (now 2). Reset to 🌼, count=1.\n\nElement9: 🌳 → different. count1 → no. So row9 has two horizontal runs: 🐋🐋 and 🐫🐫. So row9 contributes 2.\n\nRow10 (assuming rows are 0-based? Wait, the input given has 10 rows. So rows 0-9. But in the code, perhaps the problem is 10 rows, 10 columns each. Let's check row 9 here (the last one):\n\nRow9 (the 10th row in the input as listed) is:\n\n🌼🌳🐫🌼🐋🐋🦩🐚🌳🐋\n\nElements: 🌼, 🌳, 🐫, 🌼, 🐋, 🐋, 🦩, 🐚, 🌳, 🐋.\n\nProcessing:\n\nCurrent: 🌼, count=1.\n\nElement1: 🌳 → different. count1 → no. Reset to 🌳, count=1.\n\nElement2: 🐫 → different. count1 → no. Reset to 🐫, count=1.\n\nElement3: 🌼 → different. count1 → no. Reset to 🌼, count=1.\n\nElement4: 🐋 → different. count1 → no. Reset to 🐋, count=1.\n\nElement5: 🐋 → same → count=2.\n\nElement6: 🦩 → different. Run of 2 → increment (1). Reset to 🦩, count=1.\n\nElement7: 🐚 → different. count1 → no. Reset to 🐚, count=1.\n\nElement8: 🌳 → different. count1 → no. Reset to 🌳, count=1.\n\nElement9: 🐋 → different. count1 → no. So row10 (if that's the case) contributes 1.\n\nWait, but the user provided 10 rows. Let me check again. The input given by the user has:\n\nThe board is:\n\nRow1: 🌼🐋🥀🚀🐚🚀🌳🐚🥀🚀\n\nRow2: 🐚🌳🌳🌼🐫🥀🌳🌼🦔🌼\n\nRow3: 🐋🥀🐫🐫🥀🐚🦩🥀🦩🌳\n\nRow4: 🦔🦩🐫🌼🐋🌼🌳🐋🐋🐋\n\nRow5: 🚀🥀🐫🌳🌳🌼🥀🐫🌳🐚\n\nRow6: 🥀🐚🌳🥀🌼🥀🐋🥀🐚🐫\n\nRow7: 🌳🦔🌼🐋🐚🚀🐋🚀🦩🐚\n\nRow8: 🐫🌳🌳🚀🚀🦩🌳🥀🦔🥀\n\nRow9: 🐚🥀🐋🐋🦔🐚🐫🐫🌼🌳\n\nRow10: 🌼🌳🐫🌼🐋🐋🦩🐚🌳🐋\n\nWait, the last row (row10) is the 10th row.\n\nSo in the rows, rows 0-9 (assuming 0-based index), each row has 10 elements (columns 0-9).\n\nSo for the rows, after processing all 10 rows, the horizontal lines are:\n\nRow1: 0\n\nRow2: 1\n\nRow3: 1\n\nRow4: 1\n\nRow5: 1\n\nRow6: 0\n\nRow7: 0\n\nRow8: 3\n\nRow9 (the 9th index row): 2\n\nRow10 (assuming no, because the user's input lists 10 rows, which would be 0-9. So the last row is row9 (index 9) as per the input. So the row counts are:\n\nRow0: 0\n\nRow1: 1\n\nRow2: 1\n\nRow3: 1\n\nRow4: 1\n\nRow5: 0\n\nRow6: 0\n\nRow7: 3\n\nRow8: 2\n\nRow9 (the last row in the input) : let's check. The last row given is:\n\n🌼🌳🐫🌼🐋🐋🦩🐚🌳🐋\n\nProcessing this row (row9):\n\nElements: 🌼, 🌳, 🐫, 🌼, 🐋, 🐋, 🦩, 🐚, 🌳, 🐋.\n\nCurrent emoji: 🌼, count=1.\n\nElement1 (🌳) → different. count=1 → no. Reset to 🌳, count=1.\n\nElement2 (🐫) → different. count=1 → no. Reset to 🐫, count=1.\n\nElement3 (🌼) → different. count=1 → no. Reset to 🌼, count=1.\n\nElement4 (🐋) → different. count=1 → no. Reset to 🐋, count=1.\n\nElement5 (🐋) → same → count=2.\n\nElement6 (🦩) → different. So run of 2 → increment count (1). Reset to 🦩, count=1.\n\nElement7 (🐚) → different. count=1 → no. Reset to 🐚, count=1.\n\nElement8 (🌳) → different. count=1 → no. Reset to 🌳, count=1.\n\nElement9 (🐋) → different. count=1 → no. So this row (row9) contributes 1.\n\nSo previous miscalculation. So the row counts are:\n\nRow0 (first row): 0\n\nRow1 (second row): 1\n\nRow2: 1\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:0\n\nRow7:0\n\nRow8:3\n\nRow9 (last row):1.\n\nWait, what's the actual row index for the user's input? Let me list them properly:\n\nThe user's input lists 10 rows. Let's number them from 0 to 9.\n\nSo:\n\nRow0: 🌼🐋🥀🚀🐚🚀🌳🐚🥀🚀 → 0 lines\n\nRow1: 🐚🌳🌳🌼🐫🥀🌳🌼🦔🌼 → 1 line\n\nRow2: 🐋🥀🐫🐫🥀🐚🦩🥀🦩🌳 → 1 line\n\nRow3: 🦔🦩🐫🌼🐋🌼🌳🐋🐋🐋 → 1 line (the last three 🐋 are a run of 3, counts as 1)\n\nRow4: 🚀🥀🐫🌳🌳🌼🥀🐫🌳🐚 → 1 line (🌳🌳)\n\nRow5: 🥀🐚🌳🥀🌼🥀🐋🥀🐚🐫 → 0 lines\n\nRow6: 🌳🦔🌼🐋🐚🚀🐋🚀🦩🐚 → 0 lines\n\nRow7: 🐫🌳🌳🚀🚀🦩🌳🥀🦔🥀 → 3 lines (🌳🌳, 🚀🚀, 🥀🥀)\n\nRow8: 🐚🥀🐋🐋🦔🐚🐫🐫🌼🌳 → 2 lines (🐋🐋 and 🐫🐫)\n\nRow9: 🌼🌳🐫🌼🐋🐋🦩🐚🌳🐋 → 1 line (🐋🐋)\n\nSo adding up the horizontal lines:\n\n0 +1 +1 +1 +1 +0 +0 +3 +2 +1 = 0+1=1; +1=2; +1=3; +1=4; +0=4; +0=4; +3=7; +2=9; +1=10.\n\nSo total horizontal lines are 10.\n\nNow, proceed to count vertical lines.\n\nColumns. For each of the 10 columns (0-9), check each row (top to bottom) for runs of same emoji of length >=2.\n\nEach column is vertical.\n\nLet's process each column.\n\nColumn0:\n\nElements from rows 0-9, column0:\n\nRow0: 🌼\n\nRow1: 🐚\n\nRow2: 🐋\n\nRow3: 🦔\n\nRow4: 🚀\n\nRow5: 🥀\n\nRow6: 🌳\n\nRow7: 🐫\n\nRow8: 🐚\n\nRow9: 🌼\n\nSo the column is: 🌼, 🐚, 🐋, 🦔, 🚀, 🥀, 🌳, 🐫, 🐚, 🌼.\n\nLooking for consecutive runs.\n\nCurrent emoji: 🌼, count=1.\n\nRow1: 🐚 → different. count=1 → no. Reset to 🐚, count=1.\n\nRow2: 🐋 → different. count=1 → no. Reset to 🐋, count=1.\n\nRow3: 🦔 → different. count=1 → no. Reset to 🦔, count=1.\n\nRow4: 🚀 → different. count=1 → no. Reset to 🚀, count=1.\n\nRow5: 🥀 → different. count=1 → no. Reset to 🥀, count=1.\n\nRow6: 🌳 → different. count=1 → no. Reset to 🌳, count=1.\n\nRow7: 🐫 → different. count=1 → no. Reset to 🐫, count=1.\n\nRow8: 🐚 → different. count=1 → no. Reset to 🐚, count=1.\n\nRow9: 🌼 → different. count=1 → no. So column0 has 0 vertical lines.\n\nColumn1:\n\nElements:\n\nRow0: 🐋\n\nRow1: 🌳\n\nRow2: 🥀\n\nRow3: 🦩\n\nRow4: 🥀\n\nRow5: 🐚\n\nRow6: 🦔\n\nRow7: 🌳\n\nRow8: 🥀\n\nRow9: 🌳\n\nSo the sequence: 🐋, 🌳, 🥀, 🦩, 🥀, 🐚, 🦔, 🌳, 🥀, 🌳.\n\nNo consecutive duplicates. So column1 has 0.\n\nColumn2:\n\nElements:\n\nRow0: 🥀\n\nRow1: 🌳\n\nRow2: 🐫\n\nRow3: 🐫\n\nRow4: 🐫\n\nRow5: 🌳\n\nRow6: 🌼\n\nRow7: 🌳\n\nRow8: 🐋\n\nRow9: 🐫.\n\nSequence: 🥀, 🌳, 🐫, 🐫, 🐫, 🌳, 🌼, 🌳, 🐋, 🐫.\n\nLooking for runs.\n\nCurrent: 🥀, count=1.\n\nRow1: 🌳 → different. count=1 → no. Reset to 🌳, count=1.\n\nRow2: 🐫 → different. count=1 → no. Reset to 🐫, count=1.\n\nRow3: 🐫 → same. count=2.\n\nRow4: 🐫 → same. count=3.\n\nRow5: 🌳 → different. Check previous run (3 ≥2). So increment vertical count by 1. Reset to 🌳, count=1.\n\nRow6: 🌼 → different. count=1 → no. Reset to 🌼, count=1.\n\nRow7: 🌳 → different. count=1 → no. Reset to 🌳, count=1.\n\nRow8: 🐋 → different. count=1 → no. Reset to 🐋, count=1.\n\nRow9: 🐫 → different. count=1 → no. So in column2, the run of 🐫🐫🐫 (positions 2-4) counts as one vertical line. So column2 contributes 1.\n\nColumn3:\n\nElements:\n\nRow0: 🚀\n\nRow1: 🌼\n\nRow2: 🐫\n\nRow3: 🌼\n\nRow4: 🌳\n\nRow5: 🥀\n\nRow6: 🐋\n\nRow7: 🚀\n\nRow8: 🐋\n\nRow9: 🌼.\n\nSequence: 🚀, 🌼, 🐫, 🌼, 🌳, 🥀, 🐋, 🚀, 🐋, 🌼.\n\nNo consecutive duplicates. So column3 has 0.\n\nColumn4:\n\nElements:\n\nRow0: 🐚\n\nRow1: 🐫\n\nRow2: 🥀\n\nRow3: 🐋\n\nRow4: 🌳\n\nRow5: 🌼\n\nRow6: 🐚\n\nRow7: 🚀\n\nRow8: 🦔\n\nRow9: 🐋.\n\nSequence: 🐚, 🐫, 🥀, 🐋, 🌳, 🌼, 🐚, 🚀, 🦔, 🐋.\n\nNo consecutive duplicates. So column4 has 0.\n\nColumn5:\n\nElements:\n\nRow0: 🚀\n\nRow1: 🥀\n\nRow2: 🐚\n\nRow3: 🌼\n\nRow4: 🌼\n\nRow5: 🥀\n\nRow6: 🚀\n\nRow7: 🦩\n\nRow8: 🐚\n\nRow9: 🦩.\n\nSequence: 🚀, 🥀, 🐚, 🌼, 🌼, 🥀, 🚀, 🦩, 🐚, 🦩.\n\nLooking for runs.\n\nCurrent: 🚀, count=1.\n\nRow1: 🥀 → different. count=1 → no. Reset to 🥀, count=1.\n\nRow2: 🐚 → different. count=1 → no. Reset to 🐚, count=1.\n\nRow3: 🌼 → different. count=1 → no. Reset to 🌼, count=1.\n\nRow4: 🌼 → same. count=2.\n\nRow5: 🥀 → different. Check previous run (2 → count +=1). Reset to 🥀, count=1.\n\nRow6: 🚀 → different. count=1 → no. Reset to 🚀, count=1.\n\nRow7: 🦩 → different. count=1 → no. Reset to 🦩, count=1.\n\nRow8: 🐚 → different. count=1 → no. Reset to 🐚, count=1.\n\nRow9: 🦩 → different. count=1 → no. So in column5, there's a run of 🌼🌼 (rows3-4). So column5 contributes 1.\n\nColumn6:\n\nElements:\n\nRow0: 🌳\n\nRow1: 🌳\n\nRow2: 🦩\n\nRow3: 🌳\n\nRow4: 🥀\n\nRow5: 🐋\n\nRow6: 🐋\n\nRow7: 🌳\n\nRow8: 🐫\n\nRow9: 🐚.\n\nSequence: 🌳, 🌳, 🦩, 🌳, 🥀, 🐋, 🐋, 🌳, 🐫, 🐚.\n\nCheck for runs.\n\nCurrent: 🌳, count=1.\n\nRow1: 🌳 → same → count=2.\n\nRow2: 🦩 → different. Check previous run (2 → count +=1). Reset to 🦩, count=1.\n\nRow3: 🌳 → different. count=1 → no. Reset to 🌳, count=1.\n\nRow4: 🥀 → different. count=1 → no. Reset to 🥀, count=1.\n\nRow5: 🐋 → different. count=1 → no. Reset to 🐋, count=1.\n\nRow6: 🐋 → same → count=2.\n\nRow7: 🌳 → different. Check run of 2 → count +=1 (now 2).

So, the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more on the given board. Hmm, I need to make sure I understand the problem correctly. \n\nFirst, let me visualize the board. The board is a 6-row by 6-column grid. Each cell has an emoji. I need to check both horizontal and vertical lines. A line here is consecutive same emojis. But the length has to be 2 or more. Wait, but even if there's a longer line, like 3 in a row, how does that count? For example, a line of 3 would contribute how many lines? Like, if it's three in a row, that's one line of length 3. But does each possible consecutive pair count as a separate line? Or is each maximal consecutive sequence considered as a single line? Oh, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". So each such sequence (maximal) of consecutive same emojis counts as one line. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So each line (sequence) of same emojis that is length >=2 in a row (horizontal) or column (vertical) counts as one. So for example, a sequence of 4 same emojis in a row would count as one line. But if there's a longer sequence, like 5, that's one line. So the total count is the number of such sequences in all rows and columns.\n\nSo the approach would be: for each row, check each possible horizontal line (maximal sequences of same emojis), count those with length >=2. Then, for each column, check vertical sequences and do the same. Sum all those counts.\n\nNow, let's look at the given board. Let me write it out properly:\n\nRow 0: 🐳🐳🐳🐳🌞🦅\nRow 1: 🐳🦅🐳🐳🐤🦅\nRow 2: 🐳🐰🌞🐤🦅🐰\nRow 3: 🦅🦅🦅🐤🦅🐳\nRow 4: 🌞🐳🦅🐤🌞🐳\nRow 5: 🐳🐤🌞🐰🌞🌞\n\nSo each row is 6 elements. Now, for each row, process the horizontal sequences.\n\nLet's start with row 0: 🐳🐳🐳🐳🌞🦅\n\nIn row 0, the first four are 🐳. Then comes 🌞, then 🦅. So the horizontal sequences here are [4 🐳], [1 🌞], [1 🦅]. So the sequence of 4 🐳 is length >=2, so count 1.\n\nRow 1: 🐳🦅🐳🐳🐤🦅\n\nBreaking down the sequences:\n- 🐳 (1)\n- 🦅 (1)\n- 🐳🐳 (2)\n- 🐤 (1)\n- 🦅 (1)\nSo the sequences longer than 1 are the two 🐳s, so that's 1.\n\nRow 2: 🐳🐰🌞🐤🦅🐰\n\nSequences:\nEach emoji is different from the next. So all are length 1. So no contribution here.\n\nRow 3: 🦅🦅🦅🐤🦅🐳\n\nBreaking down:\n- Three 🦅s (length 3)\n- 🐤 (1)\n- 🦅 (1)\n- 🐳 (1)\nSo the first sequence is 3 🦅s, which counts as 1. Then there's a single 🦅 later, but that's length 1. So row 3 contributes 1.\n\nRow 4: 🌞🐳🦅🐤🌞🐳\n\nSequences:\nEach emoji is different except maybe between 🌞 and 🐳? Let's check:\n- 🌞 (1)\n- 🐳 (1)\n- 🦅 (1)\n- 🐤 (1)\n- 🌞 (1)\n- 🐳 (1)\nAll length 1. So no contribution here.\n\nRow 5: 🐳🐤🌞🐰🌞🌞\n\nLooking at row 5:\n- 🐳 (1)\n- 🐤 (1)\n- 🌞 (1)\n- 🐰 (1)\n- 🌞🌞 (2)\nSo the last two 🌞s form a sequence of length 2. So that's 1 contribution.\n\nSo the horizontal lines are:\n\nRow 0: 1\n\nRow 1: 1\n\nRow 2: 0\n\nRow 3: 1\n\nRow 4: 0\n\nRow 5: 1\n\nTotal horizontal: 1+1+0+1+0+1 = 4.\n\nNow check vertical lines. For each column, check sequences down the column.\n\nThere are 6 columns (0 to 5). Let's process each column:\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow 0: 🐳\n\nRow 1: 🐳\n\nRow 2: 🐳\n\nRow 3: 🦅\n\nRow 4: 🌞\n\nRow 5: 🐳\n\nSo the sequences in column 0:\n\nRows 0-2: three 🐳s. Then at row 3, 🦅. So the first sequence is 3 🐳s (count 1). Then row 3's 🦅 is 1. Row 4's 🌞 (1), row 5's 🐳 (1). So column 0 has a vertical sequence of 3, which counts as 1.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, vertical sequences are consecutive same emojis in the column. So for column 0:\n\nLooking at each consecutive emoji in the column:\n\nRow 0: 🐳\n\nRow 1: 🐳 (same as previous, so part of a sequence)\n\nRow 2: 🐳 (same, continuing)\n\nRow 3: 🦅 (different, so the previous sequence ends here. That's a sequence of 3, count 1.\n\nThen from row 3: 🦅 (starts new sequence)\n\nRow 4: 🌞 (different, so sequence of 1, no count.\n\nRow 5: 🐳 (different, no count.\n\nSo column 0's vertical sequences: only the first three 🐳s (length 3) counts as 1.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow 0: 🐳\n\nRow 1: 🦅\n\nRow 2: 🐰\n\nRow 3: 🦅\n\nRow 4: 🐳\n\nRow 5: 🐤\n\nLooking at column 1:\n\nEach row is different. So all sequences are length 1. So no contribution.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow 0: 🐳\n\nRow 1: 🐳\n\nRow 2: 🌞\n\nRow 3: 🦅\n\nRow 4: 🦅\n\nRow 5: 🌞\n\nProcessing column 2:\n\nRow 0: 🐳\n\nRow 1: 🐳 (same, so sequence starts here. Row 2 is 🌞, which breaks. So sequence is 2 🐳s (count 1). Then from row 2: 🌞 (1). Row3: 🦅 (1). Row4: 🦅 (same as row3, sequence starts here. Length 2, so count 1. Row5: 🌞 (different). So column 2 has two sequences: 2 🐳s (rows 0-1) and 2 🦅s (rows3-4). So total 2.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow0: 🐳\n\nRow1: 🐳\n\nRow2: 🐤\n\nRow3: 🐤\n\nRow4: 🐤\n\nRow5: 🐰\n\nSo column 3:\n\nRow0-1: 🐳, 🐳 (sequence of 2, count 1). Then row2-4: 🐤 (3 in a row). Then row5: 🐰.\n\nSo the sequence in rows 0-1: 2 🐳s (count 1). Then rows2-4: 3 🐤s (count 1). So column3 contributes 2.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow0: 🌞\n\nRow1: 🐤\n\nRow2: 🦅\n\nRow3: 🦅\n\nRow4: 🌞\n\nRow5: 🌞\n\nProcessing column4:\n\nRow0: 🌞 (1)\n\nRow1: 🐤 (different, so no sequence. Then row2: 🦅, row3: 🦅 (sequence of 2, count1). Row4: 🌞 (1). Row5: 🌞 (sequence of 2 with row4). So column4 has two sequences: rows2-3 (2 🦅) and rows4-5 (2 🌞). So total 2.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow0: 🦅\n\nRow1: 🦅\n\nRow2: 🐰\n\nRow3: 🐳\n\nRow4: 🐳\n\nRow5: 🌞\n\nProcessing column5:\n\nRow0-1: 🦅🦅 (sequence of 2, count 1). Then row2: 🐰 (1), row3: 🐳 (1), row4: 🐳 (sequence of 2, count 1). So column5 has two sequences: 2 🦅 and 2 🐳. So total 2.\n\nSo vertical lines:\n\nColumn0: 1\n\nColumn1: 0\n\nColumn2: 2\n\nColumn3: 2\n\nColumn4: 2\n\nColumn5: 2\n\nTotal vertical: 1+0+2+2+2+2 = 9.\n\nSo total lines (horizontal + vertical) = 4 + 9 = 13?\n\nWait, let's double-check all columns.\n\nLet me recheck each column to avoid mistakes.\n\nColumn0:\n\nRows 0,1,2: 🐳 (three in a row). So that's one sequence (length 3). Then rows3: 🦅 (1), row4: 🌞 (1), row5: 🐳 (1). So column0's vertical lines: 1.\n\nColumn1:\n\nAll different. So 0.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: 🐳\n\nRow1: 🐳 (so sequence of 2, count 1).\n\nRow2: 🌞 (different).\n\nRow3: 🦅\n\nRow4: 🦅 (sequence of 2, count 1).\n\nSo total 2. Correct.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🐳\n\nRow1: 🐳 (sequence of 2, count 1).\n\nRow2: 🐤\n\nRow3: 🐤\n\nRow4: 🐤 (sequence of 3, count 1).\n\nSo total 2. Correct.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow0: 🌞 (1).\n\nRow1: 🐤 (1).\n\nRow2: 🦅\n\nRow3: 🦅 (sequence of 2, count1).\n\nRow4: 🌞\n\nRow5: 🌞 (sequence of 2, count1).\n\nTotal 2. Correct.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow0: 🦅\n\nRow1: 🦅 (sequence of 2, count1).\n\nRow2: 🐰 (1).\n\nRow3: 🐳 (1).\n\nRow4: 🐳 (sequence of 2, count1).\n\nSo total 2. Correct.\n\nSo vertical total is 1 (col0) + 0 (col1) + 2 (col2) + 2 (col3) +2 (col4) +2 (col5) → 1+0=1; 1+2=3; 3+2=5; 5+2=7; 7+2=9. Yes.\n\nNow, horizontal lines: 4.\n\nTotal lines: 4+9=13.\n\nBut wait, let me check the horizontal again.\n\nRow0: four 🐳s → 1.\n\nRow1: sequences: 🐳 (1), 🦅 (1), 🐳🐳 (2) → 1.\n\nRow2: all single → 0.\n\nRow3: three 🦅s → 1.\n\nRow4: all single →0.\n\nRow5: last two 🌞s →1.\n\nTotal 1+1+0+1+0+1=4. Correct.\n\nSo vertical gives 9, horizontal 4. 13 total?\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says \"the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So each line (maximal sequence) of 2 or more in any direction. So yes.\n\nSo the answer would be 4+9=13. So the answer is 13.\n\nBut wait, let me recheck some of the rows and columns to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nAnother check: row3: 🦅🦅🦅🐤🦅🐳. So the first three 🦅s (count 1). Then after 🐤, there's a single 🦅, which is length 1. So row3's horizontal count is 1. Correct.\n\nRow5: 🐳🐤🌞🐰🌞🌞. The last two 🌞s → count 1.\n\nVertical column4:\n\nRows4's column4 is 🌞, row5's column4 is 🌞. Wait, no. Let's look at column4 again.\n\nColumn4 indexes:\n\nRow0: column4 is index4? Let me recheck the board.\n\nOriginal board structure:\n\nEach row is given as a list of 6 emojis. So for columns:\n\nRow 0: columns 0-5 are [🐳, 🐳, 🐳, 🐳, 🌞, 🦅]\n\nSo for column4 (index 4):\n\nRow0:4 → 🌞\n\nRow1:4 → 🐤 (row1 is 🐳🦅🐳🐳🐤🦅 → index4 is 🐤)\n\nRow2:4 → 🦅 (row2: 🐳🐰🌞🐤🦅🐰 → index4 is 🦅)\n\nRow3:4 → 🦅 (row3: 🦅🦅🦅🐤🦅🐳 → index4 is 🦅)\n\nRow4:4 → 🌞 (row4: 🌞🐳🦅🐤🌞🐳 → index4 is 🌞)\n\nRow5:4 → 🌞 (row5: 🐳🐤🌞🐰🌞🌞 → index4 is 🌞)\n\nSo column4's sequence is:\n\nRow0: 🌞 (1)\n\nRow1: 🐤 (1)\n\nRow2: 🦅 (1)\n\nRow3: 🦅 (same as row2? No, row3's index4 is 🦅, but row2's index4 is 🦅. Wait, columns are vertical. So column4 consists of:\n\nRow0:4 → 🌞\n\nRow1:4 → 🐤\n\nRow2:4 → 🦅\n\nRow3:4 → 🦅\n\nRow4:4 → 🌞\n\nRow5:4 → 🌞\n\nSo sequences in column4:\n\nRow0: 🌞 (1)\n\nRow1: 🐤 (different, new sequence. Length 1.\n\nRow2: 🦅. New sequence starts here. Row3: 🦅, same. So sequence of 2 (rows2-3). Count 1.\n\nThen row4: 🌞. New sequence. Row5: 🌞. So sequence of 2 (rows4-5). Count 1.\n\nSo total in column4: 2. Correct.\n\nAnother check: column5.\n\nRow0:5 → 🦅\n\nRow1:5 → 🦅\n\nRow2:5 → 🐰\n\nRow3:5 → 🐳\n\nRow4:5 → 🐳\n\nRow5:5 → 🌞\n\nSo column5 sequences:\n\nRows0-1: 🦅🦅 → count 1.\n\nThen row2: 🐰 (1). row3: 🐳 (1). row4: 🐳 → same as row3, so sequence of 2 (rows3-4). Count 1. Then row5: 🌞 (1).\n\nSo total 2 for column5. Correct.\n\nAnother possible mistake: row1, horizontal. The row is 🐳🦅🐳🐳🐤🦅.\n\nBreaking into sequences:\n\nFirst character is 🐳 (1). Then 🦅 (1). Then two 🐳s (count 1). Then 🐤 (1). Then 🦅 (1). So one sequence of 2. So yes.\n\nRow1: count 1.\n\nHmm. Seems correct.\n\nSo, adding up, the answer should be 13.\n\n\nAnswer: 13"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more. The board is a 5x5 grid. Hmm. So each line can be in a row (horizontal) or column (vertical). But wait, a line here is consecutive same emojis in a straight line, right? And lines of length 2 or longer. Also, overlapping sequences count as separate lines? Or is a longer line considered multiple lines?\n\nWait, for example, if a row has 3 same emojis in a row, that's considered a line of length 3. So how does that contribute to the count? Because the problem says lines formed by the same emoji with length 2 or more. So a line of 3 would count as two separate lines (positions 1-2 and 2-3?), or is it considered one line of length 3? The problem statement is a bit ambiguous here. Because in some counting problems, a longer line is considered as multiple possible shorter lines.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem considers any consecutive sequence of 2 or more same emojis in a straight line (horizontal or vertical) as a single line. For example, a sequence of 3 same emojis would count as one line. So each maximal consecutive sequence (can't be extended) counts as one line, regardless of its length as long as it's ≥2.\n\nWait, the question says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So each such line is a contiguous sequence of the same emoji, either horizontally in a row or vertically in a column, and the length is at least 2.\n\nSo the way to approach this is to check each row for horizontal sequences and each column for vertical sequences. For each row, scan from left to right, find consecutive same emojis, group them into runs. Similarly for each column, scan top to bottom.\n\nEach run of length ≥2 in a row or column contributes 1 to the total count.\n\nSo for example, if a row is like A A A, then this is a single run of length 3. So it counts as 1 horizontal line.\n\nIf a row is A A B A A, then there's two runs of A's (length 2 and 2), so 2 horizontal lines.\n\nSo the task is to find all such runs (horizontal and vertical) and sum their counts.\n\nOkay, now let's look at the given board.\n\nThe board is 5 rows, each with 5 emojis. Let's represent them as a grid.\n\nRow 1: 🐮🐭🐯🐯🐮 → Let's note these as [C, R, T, T, C] (assuming Cow, Rat, Tiger, etc., but the actual symbols don't matter; just that the emojis are the same when they are the same.)\n\nWait, perhaps the actual emojis are in code points, but for our purpose, the exact emoji doesn't matter. Just need to compare adjacent ones.\n\nLet me write the grid as a 5x5 matrix:\n\nRow 0: 🐮, 🐭, 🐯, 🐯, 🐮\n\nRow 1: 🐮, 🐯, 🐭, 🐯, 🐭\n\nRow 2: 🐯, 🐯, 🐭, 🐮, 🐯\n\nRow 3: 🐮, 🐯, 🐯, 🐮, 🐯\n\nRow 4: 🐮, 🐯, 🐮, 🐭, 🐭\n\nWait, let's index rows from 0 to 4 (top to bottom) and columns 0 to 4 (left to right).\n\nNow, for each row, check horizontal runs.\n\nRow 0: [🐮, 🐭, 🐯, 🐯, 🐮]\n\nLet's look for consecutive same emojis:\n\n- 🐮 and 🐭: different. Next, 🐭 and 🐯: different. Then 🐯 and 🐯: same. So a run of 2. Then 🐯 and 🐮: different. Then 🐮 is the last, no next. So in row 0, there's one horizontal run of length 2 (positions 2-3). So that's 1.\n\nRow 1: [🐮, 🐯, 🐭, 🐯, 🐭]\n\nCheck each consecutive pair.\n\nBetween 🐮 and 🐯: different. 🐯 and 🐭: different. 🐭 and 🐯: different. 🐯 and 🐭: different. So no consecutive same in a row. So row 1 contributes 0.\n\nRow 2: [🐯, 🐯, 🐭, 🐮, 🐯]\n\nFirst two 🐯: run of 2. Then 🐯 and 🐭: different. Next, 🐭 and 🐮: different. 🐮 and 🐯: different. So row 2 contributes 1.\n\nRow 3: [🐮, 🐯, 🐯, 🐮, 🐯]\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\n🐮 and 🐯: different. Then 🐯 and 🐯: same. So run of 2. Then 🐯 and 🐮: different. 🐮 and 🐯: different. So row 3 has one horizontal run of length 2. So 1.\n\nRow 4: [🐮, 🐯, 🐮, 🐭, 🐭]\n\nConsecutive pairs:\n\n🐮 and 🐯: different. 🐯 and 🐮: different. 🐮 and 🐭: different. 🐭 and 🐭: same. So run of 2. So row 4 contributes 1.\n\nSo total horizontal lines: 1 + 0 +1 +1 +1 = 4.\n\nNow, check vertical runs (columns).\n\nEach column has 5 elements. For each column, check consecutive elements top to bottom.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow 0: 🐮\n\nRow 1: 🐮\n\nRow 2: 🐯\n\nRow 3: 🐮\n\nRow 4: 🐮\n\nSo, looking at consecutive pairs:\n\nRow 0-1: 🐮 and 🐮: same. So run starts here. Then row1-2: 🐮 vs 🐯: different. So run of length 2 (rows 0-1) → 1 vertical line.\n\nThen row2: 🐯. Next row3: 🐮 → different. Then row3-4: 🐮 and 🐮: same. So another run of length 2. So column 0 has two vertical runs.\n\nBut wait, in column 0, the elements are:\n\nRow 0: 🐮\n\nRow 1: 🐮\n\nRow 2: 🐯\n\nRow 3: 🐮\n\nRow 4: 🐮\n\nSo when you look for runs:\n\n- rows 0-1: same (🐮), which is a run of length 2. Then row2 is different. Then rows3-4: same (🐮), run of length 2. So two vertical lines in column 0.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow0: 🐭\n\nRow1: 🐯\n\nRow2: 🐯\n\nRow3: 🐯\n\nRow4: 🐯\n\nCheck vertical:\n\nRow0 vs row1: 🐭 vs 🐯 → different.\n\nRow1 vs row2: 🐯 and 🐯 → same. Then row2 vs row3: same. Then row3 vs row4: same.\n\nSo the entire column from row1 to row4 is 🐯, but consecutive.\n\nWait, column1:\n\nRow0: 🐭 (1)\n\nRow1: 🐯 (2)\n\nRow2: 🐯 (3)\n\nRow3: 🐯 (4)\n\nRow4: 🐯 (5)\n\nSo, row1 to row4 are all 🐯. So consecutive pairs:\n\nRow1 and row2: same → run starts here. Then row2 and 3: same. Continue. So row1 to row4 is a run of 4. That's a single vertical line of length 4. So for column1, how many lines?\n\nThe problem says lines of length ≥2. So a run of 4 counts as one line. So column1 contributes 1.\n\nWait, but how about overlapping runs? For example, in a run of 4 (like rows1-4), there are three runs of length 2 (rows1-2, rows2-3, rows3-4), but according to the problem's requirements, each maximal run (longest possible) counts once. Or does each possible consecutive sequence of ≥2 count as separate lines?\n\nThis is the crux of the problem. If the problem counts each maximal run (regardless of length as long as ≥2) as one line, then a run of 4 in a column counts as one line. If it counts all possible consecutive pairs (so for a run of 3, you have two pairs: positions 0-1 and 1-2, but perhaps that's not the case here.\n\nBut the problem statement says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So a line's length is the number of consecutive same emojis. So a run of 4 in a column is one line of length 4. So that counts as 1. So in column1, the entire rows1-4 are 🐯, which is a vertical run of 4 → counts as 1.\n\nBut let's confirm with the problem statement. The problem says to count the number of lines (each line is a consecutive sequence of same emoji, either horizontal or vertical, with length ≥2). So each such consecutive sequence is a line. So in column1, the run from rows1-4 (4 emojis) is a single vertical line. So that's 1.\n\nSo column1: 1.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: 🐯 (2)\n\nRow1: 🐭 (3)\n\nRow2: 🐭 (4)\n\nRow3: 🐯 (5)\n\nRow4: 🐮 (6)\n\nWait, column2:\n\nRow0: 🐯\n\nRow1: 🐭\n\nRow2: 🐭\n\nRow3: 🐯\n\nRow4: 🐮\n\nLooking for vertical runs:\n\nRow0: 🐯 → next row1 (🐭) → different. So no.\n\nRow1: 🐭 and row2: 🐭 → same. So run of 2. Then row2 to row3: 🐭 vs 🐯 → different. So this run contributes 1.\n\nRow3: 🐯, row4: 🐮 → different. So column2 has one vertical line (rows1-2).\n\nSo column2 contributes 1.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🐯\n\nRow1: 🐯\n\nRow2: 🐮\n\nRow3: 🐮\n\nRow4: 🐭\n\nCheck vertical runs.\n\nRow0 and row1: 🐯 and 🐯 → same. Run of 2 → 1.\n\nRow1 and row2: 🐯 vs 🐮 → different.\n\nRow2 and row3: 🐮 vs 🐮 → same. Run of 2 → another 1.\n\nRow3 and row4: 🐮 vs 🐭 → different.\n\nSo column3 has two vertical lines (rows0-1 and rows2-3).\n\nSo column3 contributes 2.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow0: 🐮\n\nRow1: 🐭\n\nRow2: 🐯\n\nRow3: 🐯\n\nRow4: 🐭\n\nCheck vertical runs.\n\nRow0 and row1: 🐮 vs 🐭 → different.\n\nRow1 and row2: 🐭 vs 🐯 → different.\n\nRow2 and row3: 🐯 vs 🐯 → same. Run of 2 → 1.\n\nRow3 and row4: 🐯 vs 🐭 → different.\n\nSo column4 has 1 vertical line (rows2-3).\n\nSo total vertical lines:\n\nColumn0: 2\n\nColumn1: 1\n\nColumn2: 1\n\nColumn3: 2\n\nColumn4: 1\n\nSum: 2+1+1+2+1=7.\n\nSo total vertical lines are 7.\n\nNow, total horizontal lines were 4, vertical lines 7. Total lines: 4 +7 =11?\n\nWait, let me double-check each row's horizontal runs.\n\nRow0: 🐮, 🐭, 🐯, 🐯, 🐮 → the run is the two 🐯s. So 1.\n\nRow1: 🐮, 🐯, 🐭, 🐯, 🐭 → no consecutive same. 0.\n\nRow2: 🐯, 🐯, 🐭, 🐮, 🐯 → two 🐯s at start. So 1.\n\nRow3: 🐮, 🐯, 🐯, 🐮, 🐯 → two 🐯s in positions 1-2. So 1.\n\nRow4: 🐮, 🐯, 🐮, 🐭, 🐭 → two 🐭s at the end. So 1.\n\nTotal horizontal: 1+0+1+1+1=4.\n\nVertical lines:\n\nColumn0:\n\nRuns of 2 (rows0-1) and 2 (rows3-4) → 2.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRun of 4 (rows1-4) → 1.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRun of 2 (rows1-2) →1.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRuns of 2 (rows0-1) and 2 (rows2-3) →2.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRun of 2 (rows2-3) →1.\n\nSo vertical total is 2+1+1+2+1=7.\n\nSo total lines: 4+7=11.\n\nBut wait, let me re-examine the vertical columns again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor column0:\n\nRow0: 🐮\n\nRow1: 🐮 → same. So run starts here. Then row2 is 🐯, which breaks it. So first run of 2.\n\nThen row3: 🐮\n\nRow4: 🐮 → same. Second run of 2. So yes, 2.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow0: 🐭\n\nRow1: 🐯 → different. So no run here. Then rows1-4: 🐯, 🐯, 🐯, 🐯 → the consecutive pairs. So row1 and 2 are same, row2 and 3 same, row3 and 4 same. So the entire column from row1 to row4 is a single run of 4. So one vertical line. Yes.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🐯, row1: 🐯 → run of 2. Then row2: 🐮, different. Then row2-3: 🐮 and 🐮 → run of 2. So two.\n\nSo all the vertical counts check out.\n\nSo the answer is 4 +7=11.\n\nWait, but wait, wait a minute. Let's make sure that in column1, the vertical run is considered as one line. Because the entire run is 4 emojis, which is longer than 2. So that's one line.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the total is 11.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by consecutive same emojis with a length of 2 or more in the given 5x5 grid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Horizontal Lines**:\n   - **Row 0**: 🐮, 🐭, 🐯, 🐯, 🐮 → One line (🐯🐯).\n   - **Row 1**: 🐮, 🐯, 🐭, 🐯, 🐭 → No lines.\n   - **Row 2**: 🐯, 🐯, 🐭, 🐮, 🐯 → One line (🐯🐯).\n   - **Row 3**: 🐮, 🐯, 🐯, 🐮, 🐯 → One line (🐯🐯).\n   - **Row 4**: 🐮, 🐯, 🐮, 🐭, 🐭 → One line (🐭🐭).\n   - **Total Horizontal Lines**: 4.\n\n2. **Vertical Lines**:\n   - **Column 0**: 🐮, 🐮, 🐯, 🐮, 🐮 → Two lines (🐮🐮 at rows 0-1 and 🐮🐮 at rows 3-4).\n   - **Column 1**: 🐭, 🐯, 🐯, 🐯, 🐯 → One line (🐯🐯🐯🐯 from rows 1-4).\n   - **Column 2**: 🐯, 🐭, 🐭, 🐯, 🐮 → One line (🐭🐭 at rows 1-2).\n   - **Column 3**: 🐯, 🐯, 🐮, 🐮, 🐭 → Two lines (🐯🐯 at rows 0-1 and 🐮🐮 at rows 2-3).\n   - **Column 4**: 🐮, 🐭, 🐯, 🐯, 🐭 → One line (🐯🐯 at rows 2-3).\n   - **Total Vertical Lines**: 7.\n\n### Final Calculation:\n- **Horizontal Lines**: 4\n- **Vertical Lines**: 7\n- **Total Lines**: \\(4 + 7 = 11\\)\n\nANSWER: 11\n\nAnswer: 11"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The lines have to be length 2 or more. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the board. The board is a rectangle made up of rows and columns. Each cell contains an emoji. I need to check each row for consecutive same emojis (horizontal lines) and each column for consecutive same emojis (vertical lines). Then, count all such lines where the length is 2 or more. But wait, how do lines count here? Like, if there's a row like 🌈🌈🌈, how many lines of length 2 or more are there?\n\nOh right, for a sequence of length N, the number of possible lines is (N * (N-1)) \/ 2. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". So each consecutive sequence of the same emoji in a row or column counts as a line if it's length is at least 2. But for example, in a row like A A A, that's a single line of length 3. Similarly, a vertical line of three same emojis is a single line of length 3. So each consecutive same emojis in a row or column, considered as a line, and each such line contributes 1 to the total count if its length is >=2.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. For each row, check consecutive same emojis. Split the row into runs of the same emoji. For each run with length >=2, add 1 to the count.\n\n2. Do the same for each column. For each column, check consecutive runs and add 1 for each run of length >=2.\n\nThen sum all these counts.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji\". So the line can be horizontal or vertical, and each line is a straight line of same emojis. So for example, in a row, a run of length 3 (like AAA) would count as one line. Similarly, a run of 4 would count as one line. So regardless of how long the run is, as long as it's 2 or longer, it's one line.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCheck each row and each column for consecutive runs of the same emoji. Each such run of length >=2 counts as a single line. So the total number is the sum over all rows and columns of the number of runs in that row\/column with length >=2.\n\nLet me start by looking at the given board.\n\nThe board is:\n\nRow 0: 🦆🌈🦃🦀🦃🦀🦆\n\nRow 1: 🌑🦃☄️☄️🌈🦆🦃\n\nRow 2: 🦃🦆🦆🌈☄️☄️🌈\n\nRow 3: ☄️🦃🦆🌈🦀🌈🦀\n\nRow 4: ☄️🦃🦀🌑🦀🌑🦆\n\nRow 5: 🦃🌈🦆🌈🦆🦆🌈\n\nRow 6: 🦃🦆☄️🌑🦀🦀☄️\n\nFirst, let's process each row for horizontal lines.\n\nRow 0: 🦆, 🌈, 🦃, 🦀, 🦃, 🦀, 🦆. All consecutive emojis are different. So no horizontal lines here. Count for row 0: 0.\n\nRow 1: 🌑, 🦃, ☄️, ☄️, 🌈, 🦆, 🦃. Here, the third and fourth elements are ☄️☄️. So a run of length 2. So count +=1 for this row. The rest are single. Total horizontal in row 1: 1.\n\nRow 2: 🦃, 🦆, 🦆, 🌈, ☄️, ☄️, 🌈. The second and third are 🦆🦆 (run of 2). Then fifth and sixth are ☄️☄️ (run of 2). So two runs. So row 2 contributes 2.\n\nRow 3: ☄️, 🦃, 🦆, 🌈, 🦀, 🌈, 🦀. All consecutive are different except perhaps the fifth and sixth? Let's see: 🌈 comes after 🦀, then 🌈, then 🦀. So no consecutive same. So row 3 has no horizontal lines. So count 0.\n\nRow 4: ☄️, 🦃, 🦀, 🌑, 🦀, 🌑, 🦆. All consecutive are different. So 0.\n\nRow 5: 🦃, 🌈, 🦆, 🌈, 🦆, 🦆, 🌈. The fifth and sixth are 🦆🦆 (run of 2). So count +=1 for row 5. Also, any others? The other elements are alternating. So row 5 contributes 1.\n\nRow 6: 🦃, 🦆, ☄️, 🌑, 🦀, 🦀, ☄️. The fifth and sixth are 🦀🦀 (run of 2). So count +=1. So row 6 contributes 1.\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 0 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 0 +1 +1 = 5.\n\nNow vertical lines. For each column, check consecutive emojis.\n\nThe board has 7 columns (since each row has 7 elements).\n\nLet's process each column 0 to 6.\n\nColumn 0: elements are:\n\nRow 0: 🦆\n\nRow 1: 🌑\n\nRow 2: 🦃\n\nRow 3: ☄️\n\nRow 4: ☄️\n\nRow 5: 🦃\n\nRow 6: 🦃\n\nSo in column 0:\n\nRows 3 and 4 are ☄️ and ☄️. That's a run of 2. So vertical line here. Then rows 5 and 6: 🦃, 🦃. Wait, rows 5 and 6 of column 0? Let me check.\n\nWait column 0 for row 5 is 🦃? Because row 5 is 🦃🌈🦆🌈🦆🦆🌈. So column 0 is first element: row 5's first element is 🦃. Row 6's first element is 🦃. So column 0's elements are:\n\nRow 0: 🦆\n\nRow 1: 🌑\n\nRow 2: 🦃\n\nRow 3: ☄️\n\nRow 4: ☄️\n\nRow 5: 🦃\n\nRow 6: 🦃\n\nSo column 0:\n\nRow 3: ☄️\n\nRow 4: ☄️ → run of 2.\n\nRow 5: 🦃\n\nRow 6: 🦃 → another run of 2.\n\nSo in column 0, there are two runs of 2. So vertical count +=2.\n\nWait, but how are the runs in the column? Because the runs are consecutive in the column. Let's list all elements in column 0:\n\nRow 0: 🦆\n\nRow1: 🌑\n\nRow2: 🦃\n\nRow3: ☄️\n\nRow4: ☄️ (so rows 3 and 4: same, run of 2)\n\nRow5: 🦃\n\nRow6: 🦃 (rows 5 and 6: same, run of 2)\n\nSo the column is split into different runs. The first three rows (0-2) are all different. Then rows3-4: ☄️☄️ (run of 2). Then rows5-6: 🦃🦃 (run of 2). So two runs in column 0 of length 2. So vertical lines here: 2.\n\nSo vertical count for column 0 is 2.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow0: 🌈\n\nRow1: 🦃\n\nRow2: 🦆\n\nRow3: 🦃\n\nRow4: 🦃\n\nRow5: 🌈\n\nRow6: 🦆\n\nLooking for consecutive same.\n\nRow1: 🦃\n\nRow2: 🦆 → different.\n\nRow3: 🦃\n\nRow4: 🦃 → same. So rows3-4: 🦃🦃 (run of 2). Then rows5: 🌈, different. So vertical line here: 1.\n\nSo column1's vertical lines: 1.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: 🦃\n\nRow1: ☄️\n\nRow2: 🦆\n\nRow3: 🦆\n\nRow4: 🦀\n\nRow5: 🦆\n\nRow6: ☄️\n\nCheck consecutive.\n\nRow2 and 3: 🦆🦆 → run of 2. So vertical line here.\n\nOther consecutive pairs: row0 is 🦃, row1 ☄️ → different. Row3-4: 🦆 vs 🦀, different. Row5-6: 🦆 vs ☄️ → different. So only one run in column2: rows2-3. So vertical line count +=1.\n\nColumn2: 1.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🦀\n\nRow1: ☄️\n\nRow2: 🌈\n\nRow3: 🌈\n\nRow4: 🌑\n\nRow5: 🌈\n\nRow6: 🌑\n\nCheck consecutive.\n\nRow0: 🦀, row1: ☄️ → different.\n\nRow2: 🌈, row3: 🌈 → run of 2.\n\nRow3: 🌈, row4: 🌑 → different.\n\nRow5: 🌈, row6: 🌑 → different.\n\nSo column3 has one run (rows2-3). So vertical count +=1.\n\nColumn3: 1.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow0: 🦃\n\nRow1: 🌈\n\nRow2: ☄️\n\nRow3: 🦀\n\nRow4: 🦀\n\nRow5: 🦆\n\nRow6: 🦀\n\nCheck consecutive in column4:\n\nRow3: 🦀, row4: 🦀 → run of 2.\n\nOther rows:\n\nRow0: 🦃, row1: 🌈 → different.\n\nRow2: ☄️, row3: 🦀 → different.\n\nRow5: 🦆, row6: 🦀 → different.\n\nSo column4 has 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn4: 1.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow0: 🦀\n\nRow1: 🦆\n\nRow2: ☄️\n\nRow3: 🌈\n\nRow4: 🌑\n\nRow5: 🦆\n\nRow6: 🦀\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\nRow0: 🦀, row1: 🦆 → different.\n\nRow1: 🦆, row2: ☄️ → different.\n\nRow2: ☄️, row3: 🌈 → different.\n\nRow3: 🌈, row4: 🌑 → different.\n\nRow4: 🌑, row5: 🦆 → different.\n\nRow5: 🦆, row6: 🦀 → different.\n\nNo runs of 2 or more. Column5: 0.\n\nColumn6:\n\nRow0: 🦆\n\nRow1: 🦃\n\nRow2: 🌈\n\nRow3: 🦀\n\nRow4: 🦆\n\nRow5: 🌈\n\nRow6: ☄️\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\nAll are different. So column6: 0.\n\nNow, summing vertical lines across columns:\n\nColumn0: 2\n\nColumn1:1\n\nColumn2:1\n\nColumn3:1\n\nColumn4:1\n\nColumns5:0\n\nColumn6:0\n\nTotal vertical lines: 2+1+1+1+1+0+0=6.\n\nWait, adding 2 (col0) +1 (col1) =3, plus col2 (1) makes 4, col3 (1) →5, col4 (1) →6. So vertical total is 6.\n\nSo total vertical lines:6.\n\nNow sum horizontal and vertical lines. Horizontal was 5, vertical 6 → total 5+6=11.\n\nWait, let's recheck the horizontal counts.\n\nEarlier, the horizontal counts per row:\n\nRow0: 0\n\nRow1: 1 (☄️☄️)\n\nRow2: 2 (🦆🦆 and ☄️☄️)\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:1 (🦆🦆)\n\nRow6:1 (🦀🦀)\n\nTotal horizontal:0+1+2+0+0+1+1=5.\n\nVertical:6.\n\nTotal is 5+6=11.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in counting the runs in the columns.\n\nLet me recheck column 0.\n\nColumn0:\n\nRow0: 🦆\n\nRow1: 🌑\n\nRow2: 🦃\n\nRow3: ☄️\n\nRow4: ☄️\n\nRow5: 🦃\n\nRow6: 🦃\n\nLooking for consecutive same.\n\nRows3 and4: ☄️ and ☄️ → run of 2.\n\nRows5 and6: 🦃 and 🦃 → run of 2.\n\nBut wait, between row4 (☄️) and row5 (🦃): different. So the runs are separate. So two separate runs, each of length 2. So vertical count for column0 is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRows0-6: 🌈, 🦃, 🦆, 🦃, 🦃, 🌈, 🦆.\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\nRow3 and4: 🦃 and 🦃 → run of 2.\n\nOthers: row1: 🦃, row2: 🦆 → different. Row4 and5: 🦃 vs 🌈 → different. So only one run here. So vertical count 1.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: 🦃\n\nRow1: ☄️\n\nRow2: 🦆\n\nRow3: 🦆\n\nRow4: 🦀\n\nRow5: 🦆\n\nRow6: ☄️\n\nCheck consecutive in column2:\n\nRow2 and3: 🦆 and 🦆 → run of 2. So count 1.\n\nOther rows: no other consecutive.\n\nSo vertical count 1.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🦀\n\nRow1: ☄️\n\nRow2: 🌈\n\nRow3: 🌈\n\nRow4: 🌑\n\nRow5: 🌈\n\nRow6: 🌑\n\nRow2 and3: 🌈 and 🌈 → run of 2. So count 1.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow0: 🦃\n\nRow1: 🌈\n\nRow2: ☄️\n\nRow3: 🦀\n\nRow4: 🦀\n\nRow5: 🦆\n\nRow6: 🦀\n\nRow3 and4: 🦀 and 🦀 → run of 2. So count 1.\n\nSo columns 0-4 contribute 2,1,1,1,1. Columns5 and6 contribute 0 each. Total vertical lines 2+1+1+1+1=6.\n\nYes.\n\nSo total answer is 5+6=11.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me check again the vertical columns.\n\nWait, column0 has two runs of 2 (rows3-4 and 5-6), correct.\n\nSo 2 lines in column0.\n\nOther columns:\n\ncolumn1: 1.\n\ncolumn2: 1.\n\ncolumn3: 1.\n\ncolumn4:1.\n\nSo sum 2+1+1+1+1=6, yes.\n\nHmm. So the total lines are 5 horizontal and 6 vertical. 5+6=11.\n\nWait. Did I miss any lines in the vertical columns?\n\nLet me recheck column5.\n\nColumn5's rows:\n\nRow0: 🦀 (row0, column5?)\n\nWait, the board is 7 rows, each with 7 columns (from 0 to6).\n\nRow0: 🦆🌈🦃🦀🦃🦀🦆 → columns 0 to6:\n\n0: 🦆, 1: 🌈, 2: 🦃,3:🦀,4:🦃,5:🦀,6:🦆.\n\nAh, in the initial problem statement, the rows are given as:\n\nThe first row is 🦆🌈🦃🦀🦃🦀🦆 → that's 7 elements.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nSo columns 0-6.\n\nSo for column5:\n\nRow0: 🦀 (column5 of row0 is fifth element, which is 🦀).\n\nRow1: 🦆 (row1: 🌑🦃☄️☄️🌈🦆🦃 → fifth element is 🦆).\n\nRow2: ☄️ (row2: 🦃🦆🦆🌈☄️☄️🌈 → fifth element is ☄️).\n\nRow3: 🌈 (row3: ☄️🦃🦆🌈🦀🌈🦀 → fifth element is 🌈).\n\nRow4: 🌑 (row4: ☄️🦃🦀🌑🦀🌑🦆 → fifth element is 🌑).\n\nRow5: 🦆 (row5: 🦃🌈🦆🌈🦆🦆🌈 → fifth element is 🦆).\n\nRow6: 🦀 (row6: 🦃🦆☄️🌑🦀🦀☄️ → fifth element is 🦀).\n\nSo column5's elements are: 🦀, 🦆, ☄️, 🌈, 🌑, 🦆, 🦀.\n\nLooking for consecutive same.\n\nRow0-1: 🦀 vs 🦆 → different.\n\nRow1-2: 🦆 vs ☄️ → different.\n\nRow2-3: ☄️ vs 🌈 → different.\n\nRow3-4: 🌈 vs 🌑 → different.\n\nRow4-5: 🌑 vs 🦆 → different.\n\nRow5-6: 🦆 vs 🦀 → different. So no consecutive runs in column5. So count 0.\n\nCorrect.\n\nColumn6:\n\nRow0: 🦆\n\nRow1: 🦃\n\nRow2: 🌈\n\nRow3: 🦀\n\nRow4: 🦆\n\nRow5: 🌈\n\nRow6: ☄️\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\nRow0-1: 🦆 vs 🦃 → different.\n\nRow1-2: 🦃 vs 🌈 → different.\n\nRow2-3: 🌈 vs 🦀 → different.\n\nRow3-4: 🦀 vs 🦆 → different.\n\nRow4-5: 🦆 vs 🌈 → different.\n\nRow5-6: 🌈 vs ☄️ → different.

The example given has 7 rows and each row seems to have 7 emojis. The task is to check each row for horizontal runs of the same emoji and each column for vertical runs. Then, count each such line.

Or does each maximal line of length N contribute (N-1) lines? Wait, no. Wait, the problem states \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". So, for example, a horizontal line of 3 same emojis in a row would count as one line (of length 3). But maybe the problem is considering each individual occurrence of consecutive same emojis.

So each contiguous line (horizontal or vertical) of the same emoji that is 2 or longer counts as one. For example, a horizontal run of 3 same emojis in a row counts as one line. Similarly, a vertical run of 4 same emojis counts as one. So each maximal consecutive run (horizontal or vertical) of the same emoji, if its length is >=2, contributes 1 to the total count.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem counts every possible line of length >=2, even if they are part of a longer line. For example, a horizontal line of 3 same emojis would contribute two lines: one of length 2 (first two) and another of length 2 (last two). But that's not likely. Because that would make the count higher. The problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji\", so each maximal consecutive group. Because otherwise, the problem would need to count all possible sequences. Hmm, but the question is a bit ambiguous. But in similar problems, it's usually the maximal lines. Let me check the example given here.\n\nWait, the sample input isn't provided here. The user provided their own board and wants the answer. So I need to process this particular board.\n\nSo my approach should be:\n\n1. Iterate through each row, check for horizontal runs of same emojis of length >=2. Each such run counts as 1.\n\n2. Iterate through each column, check for vertical runs of same emojis of length >=2. Each such run counts as 1.\n\nThen sum the total from both directions.\n\nWait, but horizontal lines are in rows, vertical in columns.\n\nSo for each row:\n\nFor each cell in the row, group consecutive same emojis. Then, for each group (run) of length >=2, count it as one.\n\nWait, but in a row like 🦀🦀🦀, that's a single run of length 3. So that would count as 1 horizontal line.\n\nSimilarly, in a row like 🦀🦀🦥🦥, that's two runs: 2 🦀 and 2 🦥. Each counts as 1, so total 2.\n\nSo for each row, split into runs (consecutive same emojis) and count each run if length >=2.\n\nSame for columns: for each column, check consecutive same emojis vertically. Each run of length >=2 counts as 1.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each row in the board:\n\n   a. Split the row into runs of consecutive same emojis.\n\n   b. For each run, if length >=2, add 1 to the count.\n\n2. For each column in the board:\n\n   a. Split the column into runs of consecutive same emojis.\n\n   b. For each run, if length >=2, add 1 to the count.\n\nSum all these counts for rows and columns.\n\nSo first, I need to process the rows, then the columns.\n\nLet me look at the given board. The board has 7 rows and 7 columns.\n\nThe board is:\n\nRow 0: 🦀🦀🦀🦥🥀🐵🦀\n\nRow 1: 🐫🥀🥀🐵🐵🐫🦀\n\nRow 2: 🐵🐫🦀🐴🐵🐵🐫\n\nRow 3: 🐫🐵🐵🐴🐴🐵🦀\n\nRow 4: 🥀🐵🐴🦥🥀🐫🐫\n\nRow 5: 🐫🦥🐵🦀🥀🐵🦀\n\nRow 6: 🐵🥀🐴🐵🥀🐫🦥\n\nLet me process each row first.\n\nRow 0: 🦀🦀🦀 🦥 🥀 🐵 🦀\n\nSo the runs here are:\n\nThree 🦀 (length 3) → count 1.\n\nThen each of the next emojis are single, except the last 🦀, but between 🐵 and 🦀, that's single. So for row 0, horizontal lines: 1.\n\nRow 1: 🐫 followed by 🥀🥀, then 🐵🐵, then 🐫, 🦀.\n\nRuns: 🐫 (1) → no. 🥀x2 → count 1. 🐵x2 → count 1. Then 🐫 (1), 🦀 (1). So row 1 contributes 2.\n\nRow 2: 🐵, 🐫, 🦀, 🐴, then 🐵🐵, 🐫.\n\nRuns: 🐵 (1), 🐫 (1), 🦀 (1), 🐴 (1), 🐵x2 → count 1. So row 2 contributes 1.\n\nRow 3: 🐫, then 🐵x2 → count 1. Then 🐴x2 → count 1. Then 🐵, 🦀. So row 3 has two runs (🐵x2 and 🐴x2) → 2.\n\nRow 4: 🥀, 🐵, 🐴, 🦥, 🥀, 🐫x2 → count 1. So row 4 contributes 1 (the two 🐫 at the end).\n\nRow 5: 🐫, 🦥, 🐵, 🦀, 🥀, 🐵, 🦀. All single runs except perhaps none. So row 5 has no horizontal lines.\n\nWait, row 5: the emojis are:\n\n🐫, 🦥, 🐵, 🦀, 🥀, 🐵, 🦀.\n\nEach is single, except maybe the last two? No. So no horizontal runs here. So row 5 contributes 0.\n\nRow 6: 🐵, 🥀, 🐴, 🐵, 🥀, 🐫, 🦥. All single, no runs. So row 6 contributes 0.\n\nSo summing the rows: row 0 (1) + row 1 (2) + row 2 (1) + row3 (2) + row4 (1) + row5 (0) + row6 (0) → total rows contribute 1+2+1+2+1=7.\n\nNow check columns. Each column has 7 cells. Let's process each column:\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow0: 🦀\n\nRow1: 🐫\n\nRow2: 🐵\n\nRow3: 🐫\n\nRow4: 🥀\n\nRow5: 🐫\n\nRow6: 🐵\n\nSo the column is [🦀, 🐫, 🐵, 🐫, 🥀, 🐫, 🐵]. Let's check vertical runs.\n\nCheck consecutive same emojis. \n\nLooking at the column from top to bottom:\n\nRow0: 🦀 (starts a run of 1)\n\nRow1: 🐫 (new run, 1)\n\nRow2: 🐵 (new run, 1)\n\nRow3: 🐫 (new run, 1)\n\nRow4: 🥀 (new run, 1)\n\nRow5: 🐫 (new run, 1)\n\nRow6: 🐵 (new run, 1). So all runs are length 1. So column 0 has 0 vertical lines.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow0: 🦀\n\nRow1: 🥀\n\nRow2: 🐫\n\nRow3: 🐵\n\nRow4: 🐵\n\nRow5: 🦥\n\nRow6: 🥀\n\nSo the sequence is 🦀, 🥀, 🐫, 🐵, 🐵, 🦥, 🥀.\n\nLooking for consecutive same in vertical direction.\n\nRow0: 🦀 (run 1)\n\nRow1: 🥀 (new run, 1)\n\nRow2: 🐫 (new run, 1)\n\nRow3: 🐵 (run 1)\n\nRow4: 🐵 → same as previous (row3). So run becomes 2 → this is a vertical line. So count 1 here.\n\nRow5: 🦥 (new run, 1)\n\nRow6: 🥀 (new run, 1)\n\nSo in column 1, the run from row3 to row4 (🐵 and 🐵) is length 2. So column 1 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow0: 🦀\n\nRow1: 🥀\n\nRow2: 🦀\n\nRow3: 🐵\n\nRow4: 🐴\n\nRow5: 🐵\n\nRow6: 🐴\n\nThe sequence: 🦀, 🥀, 🦀, 🐵, 🐴, 🐵, 🐴.\n\nCheck consecutive same:\n\nRow0: 🦀 (1)\n\nRow1: 🥀 (1)\n\nRow2: 🦀 (1)\n\nRow3: 🐵 (1)\n\nRow4: 🐴 (1)\n\nRow5: 🐵 (1)\n\nRow6: 🐴 (1). No consecutive same in a column. So column 2 contributes 0.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow0: 🦥\n\nRow1: 🐵\n\nRow2: 🐴\n\nRow3: 🐴\n\nRow4: 🦥\n\nRow5: 🦀\n\nRow6: 🐵\n\nSequence: 🦥, 🐵, 🐴, 🐴, 🦥, 🦀, 🐵.\n\nLooking for vertical runs:\n\nRow0: 🦥 (1)\n\nRow1: 🐵 (1)\n\nRow2: 🐴 (1)\n\nRow3: 🐴 → same as row2. So run becomes 2 → count 1.\n\nRow4: 🦥 (new run, 1)\n\nRow5: 🦀 (1)\n\nRow6: 🐵 (1). So column3 has a run of 2 (rows2-3: 🐴🐴) → contributes 1.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow0: 🥀\n\nRow1: 🐵\n\nRow2: 🐵\n\nRow3: 🐴\n\nRow4: 🥀\n\nRow5: 🥀\n\nRow6: 🥀\n\nSequence: 🥀, 🐵, 🐵, 🐴, 🥀, 🥀, 🥀.\n\nCheck vertical runs:\n\nRow0: 🥀 (1)\n\nRow1: 🐵 (run 1)\n\nRow2: 🐵 → same as row1 → run 2 → count 1.\n\nRow3: 🐴 (1)\n\nRow4: 🥀 (run 1)\n\nRow5: 🥀 → same as row4 → run 2 → count 1.\n\nRow6: 🥀 → same as row5 → run becomes 3 (rows4-6: 🥀🥀🥀). But this is part of the same run. So in column4, the runs are:\n\n- rows1-2: 🐵🐵 (count 1)\n\n- rows4-6: 🥀x3 (count 1).\n\nSo total 2 for column4.\n\nWait, how are vertical runs processed? For a column, the runs are consecutive same emojis vertically. So for column4:\n\nRow0: 🥀 → start run of 1.\n\nRow1: 🐵 → new run (emojis are 🥀 → 🐵; different). So run starts at row1, length 1.\n\nRow2: 🐵 → same as row1 → run length 2 → count 1.\n\nRow3: 🐴 → new run.\n\nRow4: 🥀 → new run. \n\nRow5: 🥀 → same as row4 → run length 2 → count 1.\n\nRow6: 🥀 → same as row5 → run length 3 (but it's part of the same run as rows4-6). So this is a single run of length 3. So this run contributes 1, not 2 (like 2 runs of 2). Because it's a single run. So for column4, the runs are:\n\n- rows1-2: 2 → count 1.\n\n- rows4-6: 3 → count 1.\n\nTotal 2 for column4.\n\nSo column4 contributes 2.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow0: 🐵\n\nRow1: 🐫\n\nRow2: 🐵\n\nRow3: 🐵\n\nRow4: 🐫\n\nRow5: 🐵\n\nRow6: 🐫\n\nSequence: 🐵, 🐫, 🐵, 🐵, 🐫, 🐵, 🐫.\n\nVertical runs:\n\nRow0: 🐵 (1)\n\nRow1: 🐫 (1)\n\nRow2: 🐵 (1)\n\nRow3: 🐵 → same as row2 → run length 2 → count 1.\n\nRow4: 🐫 (1)\n\nRow5: 🐵 (1)\n\nRow6: 🐫 (1).\n\nSo column5 has a run of 2 (rows2-3: 🐵🐵) → contributes 1.\n\nColumn6:\n\nRow0: 🦀\n\nRow1: 🦀\n\nRow2: 🐫\n\nRow3: 🦀\n\nRow4: 🐫\n\nRow5: 🦀\n\nRow6: 🦥\n\nSequence: 🦀, 🦀, 🐫, 🦀, 🐫, 🦀, 🦥.\n\nCheck vertical runs:\n\nRow0: 🦀 → start run.\n\nRow1: 🦀 → same as previous → run length 2 → count 1.\n\nRow2: 🐫 → new run.\n\nRow3: 🦀 → new run.\n\nRow4: 🐫 → new run.\n\nRow5: 🦀 → new run.\n\nRow6: 🦥 → new run.\n\nSo in column6, the first two rows (0 and 1) are 🦀🦀 → run of 2 → count 1. So column6 contributes 1.\n\nNow let's sum up all the column contributions:\n\nColumn 0: 0\n\nColumn 1: 1\n\nColumn 2: 0\n\nColumn3:1\n\nColumn4:2\n\nColumn5:1\n\nColumn6:1\n\nTotal columns: 1+0 +1+2+1+1= 6?\n\nWait 1 (col1) +1 (col3) +2 (col4) +1 (col5) +1 (col6) = 1+1=2 +2=4 +1=5 +1=6.\n\nSo columns contribute 6.\n\nSo total lines are rows (7) + columns (6) = 13.\n\nWait, but wait, let me recheck all columns.\n\nLet me recheck each column again, in case I made a mistake.\n\nColumn0: 0.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRows3-4: 🐵 and 🐵 → vertical run of 2 → 1. Correct.\n\nColumn2: all runs are single, no. Correct.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRows2-3: 🐴 and 🐴 → vertical run of 2 → 1.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRows1-2: 🐵 and 🐵 → run of 2 (count 1).\n\nRows4-5-6: 🥀, 🥀, 🥀. The run is from row4 to row6 → length 3. So count as 1.\n\nSo column4 contributes 2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRows2-3: 🐵 and 🐵 → run of 2 → count 1.\n\nColumn6: rows0-1: 🦀 and 🦀 → run of 2 → count 1.\n\nSo column contributions are 1 +1 +2 +1 +1 = 6.\n\nSo columns contribute 6.\n\nRows contribute 7 (from earlier sum).\n\nTotal 7 +6 =13.\n\nBut wait, let me recheck the rows.\n\nRow0: three 🦀 → 1.\n\nRow1: two runs (🥀x2 and 🐵x2) → 2.\n\nRow2: 🐵x2 at the end → 1.\n\nRow3: 🐵x2 and 🐴x2 → 2.\n\nRow4: 🐫x2 → 1.\n\nRow5: 0.\n\nRow6: 0.\n\nSo rows sum: 1+2=3+1=4+2=6+1=7+0+0=7.\n\nYes.\n\nColumns sum to 6.\n\nSo total 13.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed a column. Let me recheck column5.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow0: 🐵\n\nRow1: 🐫\n\nRow2: 🐵\n\nRow3: 🐵\n\nRow4: 🐫\n\nRow5: 🐵\n\nRow6: 🐫\n\nThe sequence is:\n\nRow0: 🐵\n\nRow1: 🐫 → different, new run.\n\nRow2: 🐵 → new run (run starts at row2, length 1.\n\nRow3: 🐵 → same as row2 → run length 2 → count 1.\n\nRow4: 🐫 → new run.\n\nRow5: 🐵 → new run.\n\nRow6: 🐫 → new run.\n\nSo in column5, there's one vertical run (rows2-3). So that's 1. Correct.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRows4-5-6 are 🥀, 🥀, 🥀 → run of 3 → counts as 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo total columns 1 (col1) +1 (col3) +2 (col4) +1 (col5) +1 (col6) = 6.\n\nSo sum is 7+6=13.\n\nBut let me look at the actual board again to make sure.\n\nLooking back at row5: 🐫, 🦥, 🐵, 🦀, 🥀, 🐵, 🦀. All in row5 are single, so no horizontal runs. So row5 contributes 0. Correct.\n\nRow6: 🐵, 🥀, 🐴, 🐵, 🥀, 🐫, 🦥. All single. Correct.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow0: 🥀\n\nRow1: 🐵\n\nRow2: 🐵 → same as row1. Wait, wait, column4 is the fifth column (index 4 if starting from 0), let's check.\n\nWait, each row is 7 columns. Let's index columns from 0 to 6.\n\nSo column4 is the fifth column (index 4).\n\nLooking at the rows for column4:\n\nRow0: fifth emoji is 🥀 (index4 in row0 is 🥀.\n\nRow1: column4 of row1: fifth emoji. Let's see row1: 🐫🥀🥀🐵🐵🐫🦀. The fifth emoji is 🐵 (positions 0:🐫,1:🥀,2:🥀,3:🐵,4:🐵,5:🐫,6:🦀). So column4 (index4) for row1 is 🐵.\n\nRow2: column4 is row2's fifth emoji. Row2: 🐵🐫🦀🐴🐵🐵🐫. Index4 is 🐵.\n\nRow3: column4 for row3 is 🐴 (row3: 🐫🐵🐵🐴🐴🐵🦀 → index4 is 🐴).\n\nRow4: column4 (index4) is 🥀. Row4: 🥀🐵🐴🦥🥀🐫🐫. Index4 is 🥀.\n\nRow5: column4 is 🥀. Row5: 🐫🦥🐵🦀🥀🐵🦀 → index4 is 🥀.\n\nRow6: column4 is 🥀. Row6: 🐵🥀🐴🐵🥀🐫🦥 → index4 is 🥀.\n\nSo column4's sequence is:\n\nRow0: 🥀\n\nRow1: 🐵\n\nRow2: 🐵\n\nRow3: 🐴\n\nRow4: 🥀\n\nRow5: 🥀\n\nRow6: 🥀\n\nSo the vertical runs:\n\nRow0: 🥀 (1)\n\nRow1: 🐵 (1)\n\nRow2: 🐵 (same as row1 → run length 2 → count 1.\n\nRow3: 🐴 → new run.\n\nRow4: 🥀 → new run.\n\nRow5: 🥀 → same as row4 → run length 2 → count 1.\n\nRow6: 🥀 → same as row5 → run length 3 (rows4-6). So the run from row4 to row6 is length 3 → counts as 1.\n\nWait, but how many vertical runs are there in column4?\n\nLet me re-express the column4 as:\n\nRow0: 🥀 (run starts at 0, length 1)\n\nRow1: 🐵 (run starts at 1, length 1)\n\nRow2: 🐵 → same as row1, so run from 1-2 → length 2 → counts as 1.\n\nRow3: 🐴 → new run (3, length 1)\n\nRow4: 🥀 → new run (4, length 1)\n\nRow5: 🥀 → same as row4 → run length 2 (4-5) → counts as 1.\n\nRow6: 🥀 → same as row5 → run extends to 6 → run length 3 (4-6) → but the initial run for this was already counted as a run of 2. Wait, but the approach is to count each maximal run. So a run of 3 is a single run of length >=2 → counts as 1. So in column4:\n\n- The run from row1-2 (🐵🐵) → 1.\n\n- The run from row4-6 (🥀🥀🥀) → 1.\n\nSo total 2 for column4.\n\nYes, so column4 contributes 2. Correct.\n\nSo column4's total is 2.\n\nThus, the column contributions are:\n\nColumn0:0\n\nColumn1:1\n\nColumn2:0\n\nColumn3:1\n\nColumn4:2\n\nColumn5:1\n\nColumn6:1\n\nTotal columns 0+1+0+1+2+1+1=6.\n\nRows:7.\n\nTotal 7+6=13.\n\nSo the answer should be 13.\n\nWait, but let me recheck the columns again. Sometimes, when you have multiple runs in the same column, you can miss some.\n\nLet me check column3 again.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🦥\n\nRow1: 🐵\n\nRow2: 🐴\n\nRow3: 🐴\n\nRow4: 🦥\n\nRow5: 🦀\n\nRow6: 🐵\n\nSequence: 🦥, 🐵, 🐴, 🐴, 🦥, 🦀, 🐵.\n\nVertical runs:\n\nRow0: 🦥 (1)\n\nRow1: 🐵 (1)\n\nRow2: 🐴 (1)\n\nRow3: 🐴 (same as row2 → run length 2 → count 1).\n\nRow4: 🦥 (1)\n\nRow5: 🦀 (1)\n\nRow6: 🐵 (1).\n\nSo in column3, there's one run (rows2-3) → 1. Correct.\n\nAnother possible mistake: in column6:\n\nrows0-1: 🦀, 🦀 → run of 2 → 1.\n\nThen row2: 🐫 (new run), row3: 🦀 (new run), row4: 🐫 (new run), row5: 🦀 (new run), row6: 🦥 (new run). So only one run. Correct.\n\nThus, columns are correctly summed.\n\nSo the total is 13.\n\n\nAnswer: 13"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more. The lines can be longer, but each line of consecutive same emojis counts as one. Hmm. Wait, but how does that work? Like, if there's a line of 3 same emojis in a row, does that count as one line? Or does each possible length count? Oh right, the problem says \"length of 2 or more\", so a line of 3 would count as one line. But wait, maybe if it's longer, like 4, but the same emoji in a row, it's still just one line. So each consecutive horizontal or vertical sequence of the same emoji that's two or longer counts as a single line. Got it.\n\nThe board is given as 7 rows, each with 7 emojis. So it's a 7x7 grid. I need to check each row for horizontal sequences and each column for vertical sequences, right?\n\nLet me start by looking at the horizontal lines first. For each row, I need to check consecutive emojis. Let's take the first row: 🌺💧🐳💧🦮🌕🐟. Let's go through each element and see where there are sequences.\n\nRow 1: [🌺, 💧, 🐳, 💧, 🦮, 🌕, 🐟]\nLooking for consecutive repeats. The first emoji is 🌺, next is 💧 — different. Then 🐳 — different. Then 💧 — different. Then 🦮, 🌕, 🐟. No two same in a row. So no horizontal lines here.\n\nRow 2: 🐳🌕🦭💧🦭🐳💧. Let's break it down:\n🐳, 🌕 (different), 🦭 (different), 💧 (different), 🦭 (different), 🐳 (different), 💧. No consecutive repeats here either. So no horizontal lines in row 2.\n\nRow 3: 🌺🐳🌕🦮🐳🐟🐟. Let's check:\n🌺, 🐳 (different), 🌕, 🦮, 🐳, 🐟, 🐟. The last two are 🐟, so that's a sequence of 2. So that's one horizontal line here.\n\nRow 4: 🌕🐳🐟🐟💧🐳🦭. Let's see:\n🌕, 🐳 (different), 🐟, 🐟 (two in a row), then 💧, 🐳, 🦭. So the two 🐟s make another horizontal line. So count increases by one here.\n\nRow 5: 🦭🌕🐳🐳💧🐟💧. Check consecutive:\n🦭, 🌕 (diff), 🐳, 🐳 (two), then 💧, 🐟, 💧. So the two 🐳s here. Another horizontal line.\n\nRow 6: 🐳🐟🐳🐳🐟🐳🦮. Let's check each pair:\n🐳 and 🐟 (diff), 🐟 and 🐳 (diff), 🐳 and 🐳 (two here), then 🐳 and 🐟 (diff), 🐟 and 🐳 (diff), 🐳 and 🦮. So in the middle, two 🐳s. So another horizontal line. Wait, but the sequence here is 🐳🐳. So that's one line. But wait, the third and fourth elements are 🐳🐳. So that's a sequence of two. So that's one more.\n\nRow 7: 🦮🐳🦭🌺🌺🐳🐳. Let's look:\n🦮, 🐳 (diff), 🦭 (diff), 🌺, 🌺 (two), then 🐳, 🐳 (two). So two sequences here. The 🌺🌺 (length 2) and the 🐳🐳 (length 2). So two horizontal lines in this row.\n\nSo adding up the horizontal lines: row 3 (1), row4(1), row5(1), row6(1), row7(2). Total horizontal lines: 1+1+1+1+2=6.\n\nNow check vertical lines. Each column has 7 elements.\n\nThere are 7 columns. Let's go through each column.\n\nColumn 1: check each row's first element.\n\nRow1: 🌺\n\nRow2: 🐳\n\nRow3: 🌺\n\nRow4: 🌕\n\nRow5: 🦭\n\nRow6: 🐳\n\nRow7: 🦮\n\nSo the column 1 elements are: 🌺, 🐳, 🌺, 🌕, 🦭, 🐳, 🦮. No two same in a row vertically here. So no vertical lines in column 1.\n\nColumn 2: check each row's second element.\n\nRow1: 💧\n\nRow2: 🌕\n\nRow3: 🐳\n\nRow4: 🐳\n\nRow5: 🌕\n\nRow6: 🐟\n\nRow7: 🐳\n\nSo sequence: 💧, 🌕, 🐳, 🐳, 🌕, 🐟, 🐳. Let's look for vertical sequences. Let's check consecutive rows.\n\nRow2 and row3: 🌕 vs 🐳 (diff). Row3 (🐳) and row4 (🐳): same. So two in a row. Then row4 (🐳) and row5 (🌕) (diff). So vertical line of length 2 here (row3 and row4). That counts as one vertical line.\n\nAny other sequences in column2? Let's see row5 (🌕) and row6 (🐟): different. Row6 (🐟) and row7 (🐳): different. So column2 has one vertical line.\n\nColumn3: third elements.\n\nRow1: 🐳\n\nRow2: 🦭\n\nRow3: 🌕\n\nRow4: 🐟\n\nRow5: 🐳\n\nRow6: 🐳\n\nRow7: 🦭\n\nSequence: 🐳, 🦭, 🌕, 🐟, 🐳, 🐳, 🦭. Looking for consecutive same in the vertical direction.\n\nCheck rows 5 and 6: 🐳 and 🐳. So that's a vertical sequence of 2. So another vertical line here.\n\nAny others? Row6 and 7: 🐳 and 🦭 (different). So that's one.\n\nSo column3 has one vertical line.\n\nColumn4: fourth elements.\n\nRow1: 💧\n\nRow2: 💧\n\nRow3: 🦮\n\nRow4: 🐟\n\nRow5: 🐳\n\nRow6: 🐳\n\nRow7: 🌺\n\nSequence: 💧, 💧, 🦮, 🐟, 🐳, 🐳, 🌺.\n\nRow1 and 2: 💧 and 💧. That's two in a row. So vertical line here (rows1-2).\n\nThen row5 and 6: 🐳 and 🐳. Another vertical line here (rows5-6). So column4 has two vertical lines.\n\nColumn5: fifth elements.\n\nRow1: 🦮\n\nRow2: 🦭\n\nRow3: 🐳\n\nRow4: 💧\n\nRow5: 💧\n\nRow6: 🐟\n\nRow7: 🌺\n\nSequence: 🦮, 🦭, 🐳, 💧, 💧, 🐟, 🌺.\n\nRow4 and 5: 💧 and 💧. So vertical line here (rows4-5). So that's one.\n\nColumn6: sixth elements.\n\nRow1: 🌕\n\nRow2: 🐳\n\nRow3: 🐟\n\nRow4: 🐳\n\nRow5: 🐟\n\nRow6: 🐳\n\nRow7: 🐳\n\nSequence: 🌕, 🐳, 🐟, 🐳, 🐟, 🐳, 🐳.\n\nLooking for consecutive same vertically. Let's check:\n\nRow6 and 7: 🐳 and 🐳. So that's a vertical line (rows6-7). Any others? Let's see:\n\nRow2 and3: 🐳 vs 🐟 (diff). Row3 and4: 🐟 vs 🐳 (diff). Row4 and5: 🐳 vs 🐟 (diff). Row5 and6: 🐟 vs 🐳 (diff). Only rows6-7. So one vertical line here.\n\nColumn7: seventh elements.\n\nRow1: 🐟\n\nRow2: 💧\n\nRow3: 🐟\n\nRow4: 🦭\n\nRow5: 💧\n\nRow6: 🦮\n\nRow7: 🐳\n\nSequence: 🐟, 💧, 🐟, 🦭, 💧, 🦮, 🐳. No consecutive same in vertical here. So column7 has none.\n\nNow, summing up the vertical lines:\n\nColumn2: 1\n\nColumn3:1\n\nColumn4:2\n\nColumn5:1\n\nColumn6:1\n\nTotal vertical lines: 1+1+2+1+1 =6.\n\nSo total lines (horizontal and vertical) are 6 horizontal +6 vertical =12.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check the counts.\n\nHorizontal lines:\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:1\n\nRow7:2 → total 6.\n\nVertical lines:\n\nColumn2:1 (rows3-4)\n\nColumn3:1 (rows5-6)\n\nColumn4:2 (rows1-2 and 5-6)\n\nColumn5:1 (rows4-5)\n\nColumn6:1 (rows6-7)\n\nSo that's 1+1+2+1+1=6.\n\nTotal lines 6+6=12. So the answer should be 12. But wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, in column3, the elements are row1: 🐳, row2: 🦭, row3: 🌕, row4: 🐟, row5: 🐳, row6: 🐳, row7: 🦭.\n\nLooking at rows5 and6 (row5: 🐳, row6: 🐳 → same. So vertical sequence of 2. So that's one. Any other sequences in column3? For example, row6 and7: 🐳 and 🦭. No. So column3 has 1.\n\nIn column4: row1 and2: 💧 and 💧. That's a sequence. Then rows5 and6: 🐳 and 🐳. So two sequences in column4. So two vertical lines here.\n\nIn column5: rows4 and5: 💧 and 💧. Correct.\n\nIn column6: rows6 and7: 🐳 and 🐳. Correct.\n\nSo vertical lines total 1 (column2) +1 (column3) +2 (column4) +1 (column5) +1 (column6) =6.\n\nSo sum is 6+6=12. So the answer should be 12? But I need to make sure I didn't miss any lines.\n\nWait, let's recheck the horizontal lines again.\n\nRow7 is 🦮🐳🦭🌺🌺🐳🐳. So positions 4 and5 are 🌺🌺 (two), and positions6 and7 are 🐳🐳 (two). So two sequences here. So row7 contributes 2. So horizontal lines are:\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:1\n\nRow7:2 → 1+1+1+1+2=6. Correct.\n\nNow vertical lines. Let's redo the columns.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow1: 💧\n\nRow2: 🌕\n\nRow3: 🐳\n\nRow4: 🐳\n\nRow5: 🌕\n\nRow6: 🐟\n\nRow7: 🐳\n\nLooking for consecutive same in vertical direction.\n\nRow1 and 2: 💧 and 🌕: no.\n\nRow2 and3: 🌕 and 🐳: no.\n\nRow3 and4: 🐳 and 🐳: yes. So two consecutive here. That's a vertical line of length 2.\n\nRow4 and5: 🐳 and 🌕: no.\n\nRow5 and6: 🌕 and 🐟: no.\n\nRow6 and7: 🐟 and 🐳: no.\n\nSo column2 has one vertical line (rows3-4).\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow1: 🐳\n\nRow2: 🦭\n\nRow3: 🌕\n\nRow4: 🐟\n\nRow5: 🐳\n\nRow6: 🐳\n\nRow7: 🦭\n\nCheck:\n\nRow5 and6: 🐳 and 🐳 → yes. So vertical line here (rows5-6).\n\nAny others? Row6 and7: 🐳 and 🦭: no. So one vertical line.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow1: 💧\n\nRow2: 💧\n\nRow3: 🦮\n\nRow4: 🐟\n\nRow5: 🐳\n\nRow6: 🐳\n\nRow7: 🌺\n\nCheck vertical pairs:\n\nRow1-2: 💧 and 💧 → yes. So vertical line (rows1-2).\n\nRow5-6: 🐳 and 🐳 → yes. So another vertical line here. So total two in column4.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow1: 🦮\n\nRow2: 🦭\n\nRow3: 🐳\n\nRow4: 💧\n\nRow5: 💧\n\nRow6: 🐟\n\nRow7: 🌺\n\nCheck pairs:\n\nRow4-5: 💧 and 💧 → yes. So vertical line here.\n\nColumn6:\n\nRow1: 🌕\n\nRow2: 🐳\n\nRow3: 🐟\n\nRow4: 🐳\n\nRow5: 🐟\n\nRow6: 🐳\n\nRow7: 🐳\n\nCheck pairs:\n\nRow6-7: 🐳 and 🐳 → yes. So vertical line here.\n\nSo total vertical lines: 6.\n\nSo adding all together, 6+6=12.

I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines made of the same emoji with a length of 2 or more on this board. The board has 6 rows and 6 columns. So each line can be horizontal (same row, consecutive columns) or vertical (same column, consecutive rows). And the line must consist of the same emoji, and the length has to be at least 2. Oh right, but each line is counted as one even if it's part of a longer line. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says lines formed by the same emoji. So, for example, a horizontal line of 3 same emojis would count as one line of length 3. But the question is whether the count is per occurrence of a line of 2 or more. So, each maximal run of same emojis in a row or column contributes to the count. For example, a run of 4 same emojis in a row would contribute 3 lines (length 2,3,4?), or wait, no. Wait, perhaps each run of length N contributes (N -1) possible lines. Or maybe the problem counts each run as a single line regardless of its length as long as it's >=2. Wait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So each line is a consecutive sequence of the same emoji in a straight line (horizontal or vertical) with length >=2. So a run of 3 same emojis in a row counts as one line of length 3. Because a line is a maximal consecutive sequence. Wait, but the problem might be considering all possible possible sub-sequences. Wait, no. For example, in a row like A A A, that's a horizontal line of length 3. So how many such lines are here? According to the problem statement, each line of length 2 or more is counted. So in a run of 3, the possible lines would be the entire line (length 3) and any possible sublines. But that's probably not the case. Because if that's the case, a run of 3 would contribute 2 (length 2 and 3). But that's unclear. The problem's wording is a bit ambiguous here. Let me re-read the question.\n\nThe task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more. So each line is a set of consecutive same emojis in a straight line. So each maximal consecutive sequence (horizontal or vertical) of the same emoji with length >=2 is counted once. For example, a horizontal run of 4 same emojis in a row is counted once. Because it's one line. But if after that, there's another same emoji in the next column but separated by a different emoji, then that's two separate lines. So the approach is to check each row for horizontal runs and each column for vertical runs, count each run of length >=2 as one.\n\nSo the strategy is: for each row, scan left to right and find all consecutive sequences of the same emoji. Each such sequence of length >=2 counts as one. Then do the same for each column, top to bottom. Sum all these counts.\n\nSo let's start by looking at the given board. The board is 6x6. Let me write down the rows as given:\n\nRow 0: 🌙🌙🐨🐋🌼🌼\nRow 1: 🌙🌼🐋🐨🐋🌙\nRow 2: 🐨🌼🌙🐋🌼🌙\nRow 3: 🌼🐋🌼🐋🌙🐨\nRow 4: 🌼🌙🌙🐨🌼🐋\nRow 5: 🐨🌙🌼🐨🐋🌼\n\nFirst, process horizontal lines. For each row, track consecutive emojis.\n\nRow 0: [🌙🌙], then 🐨, then 🐋, then [🌼🌼]. So two horizontal runs of length 2. So count 2.\n\nRow 1: 🌙, then 🌼, then 🐋, then 🐨, then 🐋, then 🌙. So no consecutive same emojis. So count 0.\n\nRow 2: 🐨, then 🌼, then 🌙, then 🐋, then 🌼, then 🌙. No consecutive same. Count 0.\n\nRow 3: 🌼, then 🐋, then 🌼, then 🐋, then 🌙, then 🐨. No consecutive same. Count 0.\n\nRow 4: 🌼, then [🌙🌙], then 🐨, then 🌼, then 🐋. One run of length 2. Count 1.\n\nRow 5: 🐨, then 🌙, then 🌼, then 🐨, then 🐋, then 🌼. No runs. Count 0.\n\nTotal horizontal lines so far: 2 (row0) + 0 +0 +0 +1 (row4) +0 = 3.\n\nNow check vertical lines. For each column, check consecutive same in vertical direction (down the column).\n\nLet's process each column from column 0 to 5.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow0: 🌙\n\nRow1: 🌙\n\nRow2: 🐨\n\nRow3: 🌼\n\nRow4: 🌼\n\nRow5: 🐨\n\nSo looking for consecutive same. Starting from row0, row0 and row1 are both 🌙 → run of 2. Then row2 is different. So count 1.\n\nThen row3 (🌼), row4 (🌼) → another run of 2. Count another 1. So column 0 has two vertical runs of length 2. So total 2.\n\nWait, but in column 0, the sequence is:\n\n🌙 (row0)\n\n🌙 (row1)\n\n🐨 (row2)\n\n🌼 (row3)\n\n🌼 (row4)\n\n🐨 (row5)\n\nSo vertical runs:\n\nrow0-1: 🌙🌙 → length 2 → count 1.\n\nThen row3-4: 🌼🌼 → length 2 → count another 1.\n\nSo column0 has 2 vertical lines.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow0: 🌙\n\nRow1: 🌼\n\nRow2: 🌼\n\nRow3: 🐋\n\nRow4: 🌙\n\nRow5: 🌙\n\nLooking at the column:\n\nRow0: 🌙\n\nRow1: 🌼\n\nRow2: 🌼 → row1-2: 🌼🌼 → length 2 → count 1.\n\nThen row3 is 🐋. Then row4-5: 🌙🌙 → length 2 → count another 1.\n\nSo column1 has 2 vertical lines.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: 🐨\n\nRow1: 🐋\n\nRow2: 🌙\n\nRow3: 🌼\n\nRow4: 🌙\n\nRow5: 🌼\n\nLooking for consecutive same:\n\nCheck each pair. No two consecutive same. So vertical count 0.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🐋\n\nRow1: 🐨\n\nRow2: 🐋\n\nRow3: 🐋\n\nRow4: 🐨\n\nRow5: 🐨\n\nSequence:\n\n🐋 (0), 🐨 (1), 🐋 (2), 🐋 (3), 🐨 (4), 🐨 (5).\n\nLooking for runs:\n\nRow2-3: 🐋🐋 → count 1.\n\nRow4-5: 🐨🐨 → count 1.\n\nSo column3 has 2 vertical lines.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow0: 🌼\n\nRow1: 🐋\n\nRow2: 🌼\n\nRow3: 🌙\n\nRow4: 🌼\n\nRow5: 🐋\n\nLooking for consecutive same:\n\nNo two in a row. So count 0.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow0: 🌼\n\nRow1: 🌙\n\nRow2: 🌙\n\nRow3: 🐨\n\nRow4: 🐋\n\nRow5: 🌼\n\nSequence:\n\n🌼 (0), 🌙 (1), 🌙 (2), 🐨 (3), 🐋 (4), 🌼 (5).\n\nRuns:\n\nRow1-2: 🌙🌙 → count 1.\n\nSo column5 has 1 vertical line.\n\nNow sum all vertical lines:\n\nColumn0: 2\n\nColumn1: 2\n\nColumn2: 0\n\nColumn3:2\n\nColumn4:0\n\nColumn5:1\n\nTotal vertical: 2+2+0+2+0+1 =7.\n\nSo horizontal lines count 3, vertical lines count 7. Total 3+7=10.\n\nWait, but let's double-check.\n\nWait, horizontal:\n\nRow0: two runs (2).\n\nRow4: one run (1). So total 3.\n\nVertical:\n\nColumn0: 2\n\nColumn1: 2\n\nColumn3: 2\n\nColumn5: 1. So 2+2+2+1=7. Yes.\n\nSo total lines 3+7=10.\n\nBut let me check the column counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nColumn0:\n\nRows 0-1: 🌙🌙 (count 1)\n\nRows 3-4: 🌼🌼 (count 1) → total 2.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRows1-2: 🌼🌼 (count 1)\n\nRows4-5: 🌙🌙 (count 1) → total 2.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRows2-3: 🐋🐋 (count 1)\n\nRows4-5: 🐨🐨 (count 1) → total 2.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRows1-2: 🌙🌙 (count 1).\n\nWait, column5 rows 1-2? Column5's rows are:\n\nRow0: 🌼\n\nRow1: 🌙\n\nRow2: 🌙\n\nRow3: 🐨\n\nRow4: 🐋\n\nRow5: 🌼.\n\nSo in column5, the first two emojis are row0: 🌼, row1: 🌙 → different. Then row1: 🌙, row2: 🌙 → same. So that's a run of 2 (row1-2). Then row2-3: different. So that's one run. So column5 contributes 1. Correct.\n\nSo vertical total is 2+2+0 (column2) +2 (column3) +0 (column4) +1 (column5) → 7. Yes.\n\nSo total lines would be 3 (horizontal) +7 (vertical) =10. But wait, when I first summed column0's vertical as 2, column1 as 2, column3 as 2, column5 as 1. 2+2=4, 2+2=4, 4+1=5? No, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's recount the vertical counts:\n\nColumn0: 2\n\nColumn1: 2\n\nColumn2:0\n\nColumn3:2\n\nColumn4:0\n\nColumn5:1\n\nAdding all: 2+2=4, +0=4, +2=6, +0=6, +1=7. Yes. So vertical is 7.\n\nSo total lines 3+7=10. Hmm. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in column3.\n\nColumn3's sequence is:\n\nRow0: 🐋\n\nRow1: 🐨\n\nRow2: 🐋\n\nRow3: 🐋\n\nRow4: 🐨\n\nRow5: 🐨.\n\nSo let's look for vertical runs:\n\nRow0 is 🐋, row1 is 🐨 → different.\n\nRow2 is 🐋, row3 is 🐋 → same (run of 2) → count 1.\n\nRow4 and row5: 🐨 and 🐨 → same (run of 2) → count 1.\n\nSo column3 contributes 2. That's correct.\n\nAnother check: column1.\n\nRows are:\n\nRow0: 🌙\n\nRow1: 🌼\n\nRow2: 🌼\n\nRow3: 🐋\n\nRow4: 🌙\n\nRow5: 🌙.\n\nThe vertical runs:\n\nRow1 and row2: 🌼🌼 → count 1.\n\nRow4 and row5: 🌙🌙 → count 1. So 2. Correct.\n\nAnother check: column5:\n\nRows1 and 2: 🌙 and 🌙 → yes, count 1.\n\nSo yes.\n\nSo vertical total is 7, horizontal 3 → 10.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me check again the horizontal runs.\n\nRow0: 🌙🌙, then after that, there's 🐨, then 🐋, then 🌼🌼. So two runs: first two moons, then two flowers. So row0 contributes 2.\n\nRow4: 🌼 followed by 🌙🌙, then others. So one run of two. So row4 contributes 1.\n\nOther rows have no runs. So horizontal sum 2+1=3. Correct.\n\nYes, so the total count is 3+7=10. So the answer is 10.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more on a 6x6 board. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Horizontal Lines**: For each row, check consecutive emojis from left to right. Count each run of consecutive identical emojis with length ≥ 2.\n2. **Vertical Lines**: For each column, check consecutive emojis from top to bottom. Count each run of consecutive identical emojis with length ≥ 2.\n3. Sum the counts of horizontal and vertical lines.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nboard = [\n    ['🌙', '🌙', '🐨', '🐋', '🌼', '🌼'],\n    ['🌙', '🌼', '🐋', '🐨', '🐋', '🌙'],\n    ['🐨', '🌼', '🌙', '🐋', '🌼', '🌙'],\n    ['🌼', '🐋', '🌼', '🐋', '🌙', '🐨'],\n    ['🌼', '🌙', '🌙', '🐨', '🌼', '🐋'],\n    ['🐨', '🌙', '🌼', '🐨', '🐋', '🌼']\n]\n\ndef count_horizontal(board):\n    count = 0\n    for row in board:\n        current = None\n        run_length = 1\n        for emoji in row:\n            if emoji == current:\n                run_length += 1\n            else:\n                if run_length >= 2:\n                    count += 1\n                current = emoji\n                run_length = 1\n        if run_length >= 2:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\ndef count_vertical(board):\n    count = 0\n    cols = len(board[0])\n    rows = len(board)\n    for c in range(cols):\n        current = None\n        run_length = 1\n        for r in range(rows):\n            emoji = board[r][c]\n            if emoji == current:\n                run_length += 1\n            else:\n                if run_length >= 2:\n                    count += 1\n                current = emoji\n                run_length = 1\n        if run_length >= 2:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\nhorizontal = count_horizontal(board)\nvertical = count_vertical(board)\ntotal = horizontal + vertical\n\nprint(f\"Answer: {total}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Horizontal Check**: For each row, iterate through each emoji and track consecutive runs. If a run ends (i.e., a different emoji is encountered) and the run length is ≥ 2, increment the count. After processing each row, check if the final run in the row meets the length requirement.\n2. **Vertical Check**: For each column, iterate through each row's emoji in that column and track consecutive runs similarly to the horizontal check.\n3. **Summing Counts**: The total number of valid lines is the sum of horizontal and vertical counts.\n\nAnswer: 10"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The lines can be horizontal (same row) or vertical (same column), and each line's length has to be at least 2. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should look at the board structure. The board is given as several rows of emojis. Let me count how many rows and columns there are. Each line in the input seems to be a row. The first line has 10 emojis, so the board is 10x10 (assuming all rows are the same length).\n\nThe plan is to check every possible horizontal line in each row and every possible vertical line in each column. For horizontal lines, I'll go row by row, checking sequences of the same emoji. For vertical lines, I'll check each column, looking for sequences of the same emoji.\n\nBut wait, how do I count the lines? Because a line of length 3 would contain two overlapping lines of length 2 (like positions 1-2-3: 1-2 and 2-3). But according to the problem statement, do they count as separate lines or not? Wait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". So a single line of length N contributes (N - 1) possible lines of length 2, but perhaps the problem is considering each maximal line. For example, a run of 4 same emojis in a row would count as one line of length 4. Or does each possible consecutive pair count as a line? That's a critical point.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So a line is a consecutive sequence of the same emoji. So if there's a horizontal run of 4 same emojis, that's a single line of length 4, which counts as one. But if another line (same row) has a separate run, like A A A B B, then that's two lines (one of 3, one of 2), but since length is 2 or more, both count. So each maximal run (unbroken same emojis) contributes 1 to the count if its length is >=2.\n\nSo for example, in a row like 🐄🐄🐄🐄, this is a single line of length 4, so counts as 1. But in a row like 🐄🐄🐷🐷🐄, that's two runs (two of 🐄, then two of 🐷, then one of 🐄). But the first run (length 2) counts, the second run (length 2) counts, the third run (length 1) doesn't. So total of 2 horizontal lines here.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor each row, check each horizontal run. For each such run, if the length is >=2, add 1 to the total. Do the same for each column (vertical runs).\n\nSo now the steps are:\n\n1. Iterate through each row, find all horizontal runs. For each run with length >=2, add to count.\n\n2. Iterate through each column, find all vertical runs. For each run with length >=2, add to count.\n\nTotal is the sum of all such runs from both directions.\n\nSo the key is to process each row and column to find all such runs.\n\nLet's start by writing down the given board. Let's index rows from top to bottom (row 0 to 9) and columns left to right (column 0 to 9). Each cell can be represented as (row, column).\n\nLooking at the first row:\n\nRow 0: 🐄🐶🐄🐗🐷🐷🐗🐶🐗🐷\n\nSo let's split this into runs.\n\nStart at index 0: 🐄. Next is 🐶 (different). So run length is 1. Doesn't count. Next run starts at index 1: 🐶. Next is 🐄 (diff). Run length 1. Then index 2: 🐄. Next is 🐗 (diff). Run length 1. Then index 3: 🐗. Next 🐷 (diff). Run length 1. Then index 4: 🐷. Next is 🐷 (same). So run starts here. Let's see: positions 4 and 5 are 🐷. Then position 6 is 🐗. So this run is length 2. So count +=1. Next run starts at 6: 🐗. Next is 🐶 (diff). Run length 1. Then index 7: 🐶. Next 🐗 (diff). Run length 1. Index 8: 🐗. Next 🐷 (diff). Run length 1. Index 9: 🐷. End of row. Run length 1. So in row 0, only the 🐷🐷 run counts. So horizontal lines here contribute 1.\n\nNow row 1: 🐄🐗🐶🐄🐷🐄🐶🐄🦥🐻\n\nLet's look for runs.\n\nIndex 0: 🐄. Next 🐗 (diff). Run 1.\n\nIndex 1: 🐗. Next 🐶. Run 1.\n\nIndex 2: 🐶. Next 🐄. Run 1.\n\nIndex3: 🐄. Next 🐷. Run 1.\n\nIndex4: 🐷. Next 🐄. Run 1.\n\nIndex5: 🐄. Next 🐶. Run 1.\n\nIndex6: 🐶. Next 🐄. Run1.\n\nIndex7: 🐄. Next 🦥. Run1.\n\nIndex8: 🦥. Next 🐻. Run1.\n\nIndex9: 🐻. End. Run1.\n\nNo runs of length >=2. So row 1 contributes 0.\n\nRow 2: 🐷🦥🐗🐻🦥🐗🐶🌗🐗🐗\n\nCheck runs.\n\nIndex0: 🐷. Next 🦥. Run1.\n\nIndex1: 🦥. Next 🐗. Run1.\n\nIndex2: 🐗. Next 🐻. Run1.\n\nIndex3: 🐻. Next 🦥. Run1.\n\nIndex4: 🦥. Next 🐗. Run1.\n\nIndex5: 🐗. Next 🐶. Run1.\n\nIndex6: 🐶. Next 🌗. Run1.\n\nIndex7: 🌗. Next 🐗. Run1.\n\nIndex8: 🐗. Next 🐗 (same). So run starts here. Position8 and9: 🐗🐗. So run length 2. Count +=1. So row2 contributes 1.\n\nRow3: 🐄🐶🐓🐷🌗🐓🐓🌗🐻🐶\n\nCheck runs.\n\nLooking for consecutive same.\n\nIndex0: 🐄. Next 🐶. Run1.\n\nIndex1: 🐶. Next 🐓. Run1.\n\nIndex2: 🐓. Next 🐷. Run1.\n\nIndex3: 🐷. Next 🌗. Run1.\n\nIndex4: 🌗. Next 🐓. Run1.\n\nIndex5: 🐓. Next 🐓 (same). So run from 5 to 6: 🐓🐓. Length2. Count +=1. Then index6 is next. Run ends. Then index6: same as previous, but the next is 🌗. So run is 2. So row3 contributes 1.\n\nRow4: 🦥🐶🐗🐻🐓🌗🐓🐻🐗🐗\n\nCheck runs.\n\nIndex0: 🦥. Next 🐶. Run1.\n\nIndex1: 🐶. Next 🐗. Run1.\n\nIndex2: 🐗. Next 🐻. Run1.\n\nIndex3: 🐻. Next 🐓. Run1.\n\nIndex4: 🐓. Next 🌗. Run1.\n\nIndex5: 🌗. Next 🐓. Run1.\n\nIndex6: 🐓. Next 🐻. Run1.\n\nIndex7: 🐻. Next 🐗. Run1.\n\nIndex8: 🐗. Next 🐗 (same). Run starts here. Positions8 and9: 🐗🐗. Length2. Count +=1. So row4 contributes 1.\n\nRow5: 🐷🦥🌗🦥🐓🐷🐄🐗🌗🌗\n\nCheck runs.\n\nIndex0: 🐷. Next 🦥. Run1.\n\nIndex1: 🦥. Next 🌗. Run1.\n\nIndex2: 🌗. Next 🦥. Run1.\n\nIndex3: 🦥. Next 🐓. Run1.\n\nIndex4: 🐓. Next 🐷. Run1.\n\nIndex5: 🐷. Next 🐄. Run1.\n\nIndex6: 🐄. Next 🐗. Run1.\n\nIndex7: 🐗. Next 🌗. Run1.\n\nIndex8: 🌗. Next 🌗 (same). Positions8 and9: 🌗🌗. Length2. Count +=1. So row5 contributes 1.\n\nRow6: 🌗🐓🐓🐗🐗🐻🐓🐗🐄🐻\n\nCheck for runs.\n\nIndex0: 🌗. Next 🐓. Run1.\n\nIndex1: 🐓. Next 🐓 (same). So run starts here. Positions1-2: 🐓🐓. Length2. Count +=1. Then next is index2 (same as 1?), wait no. Let's recheck.\n\nRow6 is: 🌗, 🐓, 🐓, 🐗, 🐗, 🐻, 🐓, 🐗, 🐄, 🻥.\n\nWait, let me recheck the actual row. The user's input for row6 is:\n\n🌗🐓🐓🐗🐗🐻🐓🐗🐄🐻\n\nSo indexes 0: 🌗\n\n1: 🐓\n\n2: 🐓\n\n3: 🐗\n\n4: 🐗\n\n5: 🐻\n\n6: 🐓\n\n7: 🐗\n\n8: 🐄\n\n9: 🐻\n\nSo let's process runs:\n\nIndex0: 🌗. Next is 🐓. Run1.\n\nIndex1: 🐓. Next is 🐓. So run starts here. Positions1-2: same. Length2. Count +=1. Then index2 is part of this run. Then index3 is 🐗, different. So that's a run of 2. Then index3: 🐗. Next is 🐗 (index4). So run starts here. Positions3-4: 🐗🐗. Length2. Count +=1. Then index4's next is index5: 🐻. So run ends. So this row has two runs (positions1-2 and 3-4) each of length 2. Then index5: 🐻. Next 🐓 (index6). Run1. Index6: 🐓. Next 🐗 (index7). Run1. Index7: 🐗. Next 🐄 (index8). Run1. Index8: 🐄. Next 🐻. Run1. Index9: 🐻. Run1. So total in row6: 2 runs (each of length2). So contribution is 2. So row6 adds 2.\n\nRow7: 🐓🐻🐷🌗🐄🐓🌗🦥🐗🐓\n\nCheck runs.\n\nIndex0: 🐓. Next 🐻. Run1.\n\nIndex1: 🐻. Next 🐷. Run1.\n\nIndex2: 🐷. Next 🌗. Run1.\n\nIndex3: 🌗. Next 🐄. Run1.\n\nIndex4: 🐄. Next 🐓. Run1.\n\nIndex5: 🐓. Next 🌗. Run1.\n\nIndex6: 🌗. Next 🦥. Run1.\n\nIndex7: 🦥. Next 🐗. Run1.\n\nIndex8: 🐗. Next 🐓. Run1.\n\nIndex9: 🐓. Run1.\n\nNo runs of length >=2. So row7 contributes 0.\n\nRow8: 🐄🐶🐻🦥🐶🐷🐷🐓🐗🦥\n\nCheck runs.\n\nLooking for consecutive same.\n\nIndex0: 🐄. Next 🐶. Run1.\n\nIndex1: 🐶. Next 🐻. Run1.\n\nIndex2: 🐻. Next 🦥. Run1.\n\nIndex3: 🦥. Next 🐶. Run1.\n\nIndex4: 🐶. Next 🐷. Run1.\n\nIndex5: 🐷. Next 🐷. So run starts here. Positions5-6: 🐷🐷. Length2. Count +=1. Then index6: 🐓. Different. So this run is length2. Then index6: 🐓. Next 🐗. Run1. Index7: 🐗. Next 🦥. Run1. Index8: 🦥. Run1. So row8 contributes 1.\n\nRow9: 🐓🐷🐻🦥🐷🐻🐷🌗🐷🐶\n\nCheck runs.\n\nLooking for same consecutive.\n\nIndex0: 🐓. Next 🐷. Run1.\n\nIndex1: 🐷. Next 🐻. Run1.\n\nIndex2: 🐻. Next 🦥. Run1.\n\nIndex3: 🦥. Next 🐷. Run1.\n\nIndex4: 🐷. Next 🐻. Run1.\n\nIndex5: 🐻. Next 🐷. Run1.\n\nIndex6: 🐷. Next 🌗. Run1.\n\nIndex7: 🌗. Next 🐷. Run1.\n\nIndex8: 🐷. Next 🐶. Run1.\n\nIndex9: 🐶. Run1.\n\nAll runs are length1. So row9 contributes 0.\n\nNow sum all horizontal contributions:\n\nRow0:1\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:2\n\nRow7:0\n\nRow8:1\n\nRow9:0\n\nTotal horizontal: 1+0+1+1+1+1+2+0+1+0 = 8.\n\nNow check vertical lines. For columns 0-9, each has 10 cells (rows 0-9). Need to check each column for vertical runs.\n\nThis is going to be tedious. Let's start with column 0.\n\nColumn0:\n\nRows 0-9, column0:\n\nRow0: 🐄\n\nRow1: 🐄\n\nRow2: 🐷\n\nRow3: 🐄\n\nRow4: 🦥\n\nRow5: 🐷\n\nRow6: 🌗\n\nRow7: 🐓\n\nRow8: 🐄\n\nRow9: 🐓\n\nSo the sequence is: 🐄, 🐄, 🐷, 🐄, 🦥, 🐷, 🌗, 🐓, 🐄, 🐓.\n\nLooking for vertical runs (same consecutive in column).\n\nCheck from row0 down.\n\nRow0: 🐄. Next row1: same (🐄). So run starts here. Then row2: 🐷 (diff). So run is rows0-1 (length2). Count +=1.\n\nThen row2: 🐷. Next row3: 🐄 (diff). Run1.\n\nRow3: 🐄. Next row4: 🦥 (diff). Run1.\n\nRow4: 🦥. Next row5: 🐷. Run1.\n\nRow5: 🐷. Next row6: 🌗. Run1.\n\nRow6: 🌗. Next row7: 🐓. Run1.\n\nRow7: 🐓. Next row8: 🐄. Run1.\n\nRow8: 🐄. Next row9: 🐓. Run1.\n\nSo column0 has one vertical run of length2 (rows0-1). So contribution 1.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRows0-9, column1:\n\nRow0: 🐶\n\nRow1: 🐗\n\nRow2: 🦥\n\nRow3: 🐶\n\nRow4: 🐶\n\nRow5: 🦥\n\nRow6: 🐓\n\nRow7: 🐻\n\nRow8: 🐶\n\nRow9: 🐷\n\nSequence: 🐶, 🐗, 🦥, 🐶, 🐶, 🦥, 🐓, 🐻, 🐶, 🐷.\n\nCheck runs.\n\nRow0: 🐶. Next row1: 🐗. Run1.\n\nRow1: 🐗. Next row2: 🦥. Run1.\n\nRow2: 🦥. Next row3: 🐶. Run1.\n\nRow3: 🐶. Next row4: 🐶 (same). So run starts here. Rows3-4: 🐶🐶. Length2. Count +=1.\n\nThen row4: 🐶. Next row5: 🦥. Run ends. So run contributes 1.\n\nRow5: 🦥. Next row6: 🐓. Run1.\n\nRow6: 🐓. Next row7: 🐻. Run1.\n\nRow7: 🐻. Next row8: 🐶. Run1.\n\nRow8: 🐶. Next row9: 🐷. Run1.\n\nSo column1 has one run (rows3-4) of length2. Contribution 1.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRows0-9, column2:\n\nRow0: 🐄\n\nRow1: 🐶\n\nRow2: 🐗\n\nRow3: 🐓\n\nRow4: 🐗\n\nRow5: 🌗\n\nRow6: 🐓\n\nRow7: 🐷\n\nRow8: 🐻\n\nRow9: 🐻\n\nSequence: 🐄, 🐶, 🐗, 🐓, 🐗, 🌗, 🐓, 🐷, 🐻, 🐻.\n\nCheck vertical runs.\n\nRow0: 🐄. Next row1: 🐶. Run1.\n\nRow1: 🐶. Next row2: 🐗. Run1.\n\nRow2: 🐗. Next row3: 🐓. Run1.\n\nRow3: 🐓. Next row4: 🐗. Run1.\n\nRow4: 🐗. Next row5: 🌗. Run1.\n\nRow5: 🌗. Next row6: 🐓. Run1.\n\nRow6: 🐓. Next row7: 🐷. Run1.\n\nRow7: 🐷. Next row8: 🐻. Run1.\n\nRow8: 🐻. Next row9: 🐻. Same. Run starts here. Rows8-9: 🐻🐻. Length2. Count +=1.\n\nSo column2 has one run (rows8-9). Contribution 1.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRows0-9, column3:\n\nRow0: 🐗\n\nRow1: 🐄\n\nRow2: 🐻\n\nRow3: 🐷\n\nRow4: 🐻\n\nRow5: 🦥\n\nRow6: 🐗\n\nRow7: 🌗\n\nRow8: 🦥\n\nRow9: 🦥\n\nSequence: 🐗, 🐄, 🐻, 🐷, 🐻, 🦥, 🐗, 🌗, 🦥, 🦥.\n\nCheck runs.\n\nRow0: 🐗.

Next row5: 🐓. Same. Run starts here. Rows4-5: 🐓🐓. Length2. Count +=1.\n\nThen row5: 🐓. Next row6: 🐗. Run ends.\n\nRow6: 🐗. Next row7: 🐄. Run1.\n\nRow7: 🐄. Next row8: 🐶. Run1.\n\nRow8: 🐶. Next row9: 🐷. Run1.\n\nSo column4 has two runs (rows0-1 and rows4-5), each of length2. Contribution 2.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRows0-9, column5:\n\nRow0: 🐷\n\nRow1: 🐄\n\nRow2: 🐗\n\nRow3: 🐓\n\nRow4: 🌗\n\nRow5: 🐷\n\nRow6: 🐻\n\nRow7: 🐓\n\nRow8: 🐷\n\nRow9: 🐻\n\nSequence: 🐷, 🐄, 🐗, 🐓, 🌗, 🐷, 🐻, 🐓, 🐷, 🐻.\n\nCheck runs.\n\nRow0: 🐷.

Same. Run starts here. Rows8-9: 🐷🐷. Length2. Count +=1.\n\nSo column6 has three runs (rows1-2, 3-4, 8-9). Each contributes 1. So column6 contributes 3.\n\nColumn7:\n\nRows0-9, column7:\n\nRow0: 🐶\n\nRow1: 🐄\n\nRow2: 🌗\n\nRow3: 🌗\n\nRow4: 🐻\n\nRow5: 🐗\n\nRow6: 🐗\n\nRow7: 🦥\n\nRow8: 🐓\n\nRow9: 🌗\n\nSequence: 🐶, 🐄, 🌗, 🌗, 🐻, 🐗, 🐗, 🦥, 🐓, 🌗.\n\nCheck runs.\n\nRow0: 🐶.

Next row9: 🌗. Run1.\n\nSo column7 has two runs (rows2-3 and 5-6). Contribution 2.\n\nColumn8:\n\nRows0-9, column8:\n\nRow0: 🐗\n\nRow1: 🦥\n\nRow2: 🐗\n\nRow3: 🐻\n\nRow4: 🐗\n\nRow5: 🌗\n\nRow6: 🐄\n\nRow7: 🐗\n\nRow8: 🐗\n\nRow9: 🐷\n\nSequence: 🐗, 🦥, 🐗, 🐻, 🐗, 🌗, 🐄, 🐗, 🐗, 🐷.\n\nCheck runs.\n\nRow0: 🐗. Next row1: 🦥. Run1.\n\nRow1: 🦥. Next row2: 🐗. Run1.\n\nRow2: 🐗. Next row3: 🐻. Run1.\n\nRow3: 🐻. Next row4: 🐗. Run1.\n\nRow4: 🐗. Next row5: 🌗. Run1.\n\nRow5: 🌗. Next row6: 🐄. Run1.\n\nRow6: 🐄. Next row7: 🐗. Run1.\n\nRow7: 🐗. Next row8: 🐗. Same. Run starts here. Rows7-8: 🐗🐗. Length2. Count +=1.\n\nRow8: 🐗. Next row9: 🐷. Run1.\n\nSo column8 contributes 1 run (rows7-8). Contribution 1.\n\nColumn9:\n\nRows0-9, column9:\n\nRow0: 🐷\n\nRow1: 🐻\n\nRow2: 🐗\n\nRow3: 🐶\n\nRow4: 🐗\n\nRow5: 🌗\n\nRow6: 🐻\n\nRow7: 🐓\n\nRow8: 🦥\n\nRow9: 🐶\n\nSequence: 🐷, 🐻, 🐗, 🐶, 🐗, 🌗, 🐻, 🐓, 🦥, 🐶.\n\nCheck runs.\n\nRow0: 🐷.

Next row7: 🐓. Run1.\n\nRow7: 🐓. Next row8: 🦥. Run1.\n\nRow8: 🦥. Next row9: 🐶. Run1.\n\nNo runs of length >=2. So column9 contributes 0.\n\nNow sum the vertical contributions:\n\nColumn0:1\n\nColumn1:1\n\nColumn2:1\n\nColumn3:1\n\nColumn4:2\n\nColumn5:0\n\nColumn6:3\n\nColumn7:2\n\nColumn8:1\n\nColumn9:0\n\nTotal vertical:1+1+1+1+2+0+3+2+1+0= 12.\n\nSo total lines are horizontal (8) + vertical (12) = 20.\n\nWait, let me double-check the vertical counts:\n\nColumns:\n\n0:1\n\n1:1\n\n2:1\n\n3:1\n\n4:2\n\n5:0\n\n6:3\n\n7:2\n\n8:1\n\n9:0\n\nSum:1+1=2; +1=3; +1=4; +2=6; +3=9; +2=11; +1=12. Oh wait, 1+1=2, plus 1 (3) is 3, plus 1 (4), plus2 (6), plus0 (6), plus3 (9), plus2 (11), plus1 (12). So vertical total is 12. Yes.\n\nHorizontal is 8. So total 20.\n\nBut wait, let me recount the horizontal contributions again:\n\nRow0:1, row1:0, row2:1, row3:1, row4:1, row5:1, row6:2, row7:0, row8:1, row9:0. Adding those:\n\n1+0=1; +1=2; +1=3; +1=4; +1=5; +2=7; +0=7; +1=8. So horizontal is 8.\n\nVertical is 12. Total 20.\n\nBut wait, is this correct? Let me check some columns again.\n\nFor column4:\n\nRows0-1 are 🐷🐷 (count 1). Then rows4-5 are 🐓🐓 (count 1). So total 2 for column4. That's correct.\n\nColumn6: three runs. Let's recheck.\n\nRows1-2 (🐶🐶), 3-4 (🐓🐓), and 8-9 (🐷🐷). Yes. So 3.\n\nColumn7 has two runs: rows2-3 (🌗🌗), rows5-6 (🐗🐗). Correct.\n\nSo vertical sum is indeed 12. So total is 20.\n\nSo the answer should be 20.\n\n\nAnswer: 20"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

So, the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more on this board. Hmm. Each line (horizontal or vertical) of the same emoji that's at least two in a row or column counts as one. But wait, do lines longer than two count as multiple? Like, a line of three would be two lines (lengths 2 and 3)? Or is each consecutive sequence counted once regardless of length as long as it's >=2?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the total count of such lines\". So I think each run of the same emoji in a straight horizontal or vertical line. So for example, a horizontal run of 3 same emojis would count as one line, not two. Because a line here is a sequence of the same emoji, contiguous and in a straight line. So each such line of 2 or more counts as one. So even if a longer line exists, it's one per run. So the key is to find all horizontal runs of 2+ same emojis, and all vertical runs of same emojis, and count each as a separate line.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Check each row for horizontal lines. For each row, scan from left to right, track consecutive same emojis. Whenever a group of 2 or more is found, count one for each such group. For example, in a row like A A A, there's one horizontal line (the entire three in a row counts as one line). If the row is A A B B B, that's two lines (A's and B's).\n\n2. Check each column for vertical lines. Similarly, scan each column top to bottom, track consecutive same emojis. Each group of 2+ counts as one line.\n\n3. Sum the horizontal and vertical counts.\n\nSo first, let's look at the given board. The board is 7 rows by 7 columns (since each row has 7 emojis). Let's go row by row and then column by column.\n\nLet me write down the board as a grid for easier processing. Let's assign each row as row 0 to 6 (assuming first row is row 0). Each column 0 to 6.\n\nOriginal board as per the problem:\n\nRow 0: 🦐 🦃 🦃 🕷 🦃 🐥 🎁\nRow 1: 🦐 🐥 🐥 🐥 🐥 🐥 🕷\nRow 2: 🦃 🐥 🦐 🐥 🦃 🦐 🎁\nRow 3: 🦜 🕷 🐥 🐥 🐥 🎁 🦐\nRow 4: 🎁 🦜 🦐 🦐 🐥 🕷 🐥\nRow 5: 🦐 🎁 🦐 🦜 🦃 🎁 🦐\nRow 6: 🐥 🎁 🕷 🦃 🕷 🦃 🕷\n\nNow, let's process each row for horizontal lines.\n\nRow 0: [🦐, 🦃, 🦃, 🕷, 🦃, 🐥, 🎁]\nLooking for consecutive duplicates. Let's go through each element:\n\nIndex 0: 🦐. Next is 🦃 (index 1). Different. So no run here.\n\nIndex 1: 🦃. Next (index 2) is also 🦃. So start a run. Index 1 and 2: two 🦃. So count 1 here. Then index 3 is 🕷, different. So the run ends. So this contributes 1.\n\nThen index 3: 🕷. Next is 🦃. Different. No.\n\nIndex 4: 🦃. Next is 🐥. Different. No.\n\nIndex 5: 🐥. Next is 🎁. No. So total horizontal lines in row 0: 1.\n\nRow 1: [🦐, 🐥, 🐥, 🐥, 🐥, 🐥, 🕷]\nAll the 🐥 from index 1 to 5. So this is a run of 5 🐥. That's a horizontal line. So count 1 here. So row 1 contributes 1.\n\nRow 2: [🦃, 🐥, 🦐, 🐥, 🦃, 🦐, 🎁]\nCheck for consecutive same.\n\nIndex 0: 🦃. Next is 🐥. Different.\n\nIndex 1: 🐥. Next is 🦐. Different.\n\nIndex 2: 🦐. Next is 🐥. Different.\n\nIndex 3: 🐥. Next is 🦃. Different.\n\nIndex 4: 🦃. Next is 🦐. Different.\n\nIndex 5: 🦐. Next is 🎁. Different. So no horizontal lines in row 2. So 0.\n\nRow3: [🦜, 🕷, 🐥, 🐥, 🐥, 🎁, 🦐]\nIndices 2-4 are 🐥. So three in a row. That's a horizontal line. Count 1.\n\nRow4: [🎁, 🦜, 🦐, 🦐, 🐥, 🕷, 🐥]\nIndices 2 and 3: 🦐, 🦐. So a run of 2. Count 1.\n\nRow5: [🦐, 🎁, 🦐, 🦜, 🦃, 🎁, 🦐]\nCheck each pair. Looking for consecutive same.\n\nNo consecutive duplicates. So 0.\n\nRow6: [🐥, 🎁, 🕷, 🦃, 🕷, 🦃, 🕷]\nCheck for consecutive same. All adjacent are different. So 0.\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 1 (row0) +1 (row1) +1 (row3) +1 (row4) = 4.\n\nWait, wait. Let me recount:\n\nRow0: 1 (two 🦃)\nRow1: 1 (5 🐥)\nRow3: 1 (3 🐥)\nRow4: 1 (2 🦐)\nTotal horizontal so far 4.\n\nNow vertical lines. Need to check each column.\n\nEach column has 7 rows (since there are 7 rows). Let's check each column from top to bottom.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nEmojis in rows 0-6, column 0:\n\nRow0: 🦐\n\nRow1: 🦐\n\nRow2: 🦃\n\nRow3: 🦜\n\nRow4: 🎁\n\nRow5: 🦐\n\nRow6: 🐥\n\nCheck for consecutive same in the column:\n\nRow0 and row1: 🦐 and 🦐. That's two in a row. So this is a vertical line of length 2. Count 1.\n\nRow1 and row2: 🦐 and 🦃. Different.\n\nRow2 and row3: 🦃 and 🦜. Different.\n\nRow3 and row4: 🦜 and 🎁. Different.\n\nRow4 and row5: 🎁 and 🦐. Different.\n\nRow5 and row6: 🦐 and 🐥. Different.\n\nSo column0 contributes 1.\n\nColumn1:\n\nCheck each consecutive pair in column1.\n\nColumn1 has:\n\nRow0: 🦃\n\nRow1: 🐥\n\nRow2: 🐥\n\nRow3: 🕷\n\nRow4: 🦜\n\nRow5: 🎁\n\nRow6: 🎁\n\nLooking for runs. Let's scan top to bottom.\n\nRow0: 🦃. Next is row1: 🐥. Different.\n\nRow1: 🐥. Next (row2) is 🐥. So two in a row. Then row3 is 🕷. So this is a run of 2. Count 1.\n\nRow2: 🐥. Next is 🕷. Different.\n\nRow3: 🕷. Next is 🦜. Different.\n\nRow4: 🦜. Next is 🎁. Different.\n\nRow5: 🎁. Next (row6) is 🎁. So a run of 2. Count 1.\n\nSo column1 has two vertical lines: the run in rows1-2 (🐥🐥) and rows5-6 (🎁🎁). So column1 contributes 2.\n\nColumn2:\n\nEmojis:\n\nRow0: 🦃\n\nRow1: 🐥\n\nRow2: 🦐\n\nRow3: 🐥\n\nRow4: 🦐\n\nRow5: 🦐\n\nRow6: 🕷\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\nRow0 and 1: 🦃 and 🐥. Different.\n\nRow1 and 2: 🐥 and 🦐. Different.\n\nRow2 and 3: 🦐 and 🐥. Different.\n\nRow3 and4: 🐥 and 🦐. Different.\n\nRow4 and5: 🦐 and 🦐. Two in a row. Count 1.\n\nRow5 and6: 🦐 and 🕷. Different.\n\nSo column2 contributes 1 (rows4-5: 🦐🦐).\n\nColumn3:\n\nEmojis:\n\nRow0: 🕷\n\nRow1: 🐥\n\nRow2: 🐥\n\nRow3: 🐥\n\nRow4: 🦐\n\nRow5: 🦜\n\nRow6: 🦃\n\nCheck runs.\n\nRow0: 🕷. Next row1: 🐥. Different.\n\nRow1: 🐥. Next row2: 🐥. Then row3: 🐥. So this is a run of three (rows1-3: 3 🐥). So this is a vertical line of length 3. Count 1. Then row4 is 🦐, different. So run ends. So column3 contributes 1.\n\nWait, rows1-3 are three 🐥 in a column. So that's a vertical line of length 3, which counts as 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo column3 has 1.\n\nColumn4:\n\nEmojis:\n\nRow0: 🦃\n\nRow1: 🐥\n\nRow2: 🦃\n\nRow3: 🐥\n\nRow4: 🐥\n\nRow5: 🦃\n\nRow6: 🕷\n\nCheck consecutive pairs.\n\nRow0: 🦃. Next row1: 🐥. Different.\n\nRow1: 🐥. Next row2: 🦃. Different.\n\nRow2: 🦃. Next row3: 🐥. Different.\n\nRow3: 🐥. Next row4: 🐥. Two in a row. So count 1 here.\n\nRow4: 🐥. Next row5: 🦃. Different.\n\nRow5: 🦃. Next row6: 🕷. Different.\n\nSo column4 contributes 1 (rows3-4: 🐥🐥).\n\nColumn5:\n\nEmojis:\n\nRow0: 🐥\n\nRow1: 🐥\n\nRow2: 🦐\n\nRow3: 🎁\n\nRow4: 🕷\n\nRow5: 🎁\n\nRow6: 🦃\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\nRow0 and1: 🐥 and 🐥. Two in a row. Count 1.\n\nRow1 and2: 🐥 and 🦐. Different.\n\nRow2 and3: 🦐 and 🎁. Different.\n\nRow3 and4: 🎁 and 🕷. Different.\n\nRow4 and5: 🕷 and 🎁. Different.\n\nRow5 and6: 🎁 and 🦃. Different.\n\nSo column5 contributes 1 (rows0-1: 🐥🐥).\n\nColumn6:\n\nEmojis:\n\nRow0: 🎁\n\nRow1: 🕷\n\nRow2: 🎁\n\nRow3: 🦐\n\nRow4: 🐥\n\nRow5: 🦐\n\nRow6: 🕷\n\nCheck consecutive.\n\nRow0: 🎁. Row1: 🕷. Different.\n\nRow1: 🕷. Row2: 🎁. Different.\n\nRow2: 🎁. Row3: 🦐. Different.\n\nRow3: 🦐. Row4: 🐥. Different.\n\nRow4: 🐥. Row5: 🦐. Different.\n\nRow5: 🦐. Row6: 🕷. Different.\n\nNo vertical lines here. So column6 contributes 0.\n\nNow sum up all vertical counts:\n\nColumn0: 1\n\nColumn1: 2\n\nColumn2: 1\n\nColumn3: 1\n\nColumn4: 1\n\nColumn5: 1\n\nColumn6: 0\n\nTotal vertical lines: 1+2+1+1+1+1 = 7?\n\nWait, column0:1, column1:2, column2:1, column3:1, column4:1, column5:1. So 1+2=3; 3+1=4; 4+1=5; 5+1=6; 6+1=7. Yes. So vertical lines total 7.\n\nSo total horizontal lines were 4 (from earlier) and vertical 7. So total lines 4+7=11.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me recheck the vertical columns again to make sure I didn't miss any.\n\nLet me go through each column again.\n\nColumn0:\n\nRows 0 and 1: 🦐 and 🦐 → count 1. Correct.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRows1-2: 🐥🐥 → count 1. Rows5-6: 🎁🎁 → count 1. So total 2. Correct.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRows4-5: 🦐 and 🦐 → count 1. Correct.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRows1-3: three 🐥. Count 1. Correct.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRows3-4: 🐥🐥 → count 1. Correct.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRows0-1: 🐥🐥 → count 1. Correct.\n\nSo vertical lines sum to 7.\n\nHorizontal lines were 1 (row0) +1 (row1) +1 (row3) +1 (row4) = 4.\n\nSo total lines: 4 +7 =11.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check each row again for horizontal lines.\n\nRow0: 🦐, 🦃, 🦃, ... → two 🦃. So 1.\n\nRow1: five 🐥. So 1.\n\nRow2: no runs. So 0.\n\nRow3: three 🐥. So 1.\n\nRow4: two 🦐. So 1.\n\nRow5: no runs. 0.\n\nRow6: no runs. 0.\n\nTotal horizontal: 1+1+1+1=4. Correct.\n\nVertical lines: 7. So sum is 11. That's the answer?\n\nWait, but let's recheck another example. For instance, row4 has 🎁, 🦜, 🦐, 🦐, 🐥, 🕷, 🐥. The two 🦐's are indices 2 and 3, so horizontal run of 2. Counted as 1. Correct.\n\nIn row3: 🦜, 🕷, 🐥, 🐥, 🐥, 🎁, 🦐. The three 🐥 from indices 2-4. So horizontal run of 3 → count 1.\n\nIn column3:\n\nRow1: 🐥 (column3? Wait, no. Let me recheck column3. Each column is index 3.\n\nWait, for column3, the emojis are:\n\nRow0: 🕷 (column3 is index3 of row0)\n\nRow0's column3: 🕷.\n\nRow1: column3 is 🐥 (third emoji? Wait, no. Let's recheck.\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow0: 🦐 🦃 🦃 🕷 🦃 🐥 🎁 → columns 0 to 6. So column3 is 🕷.\n\nRow1: 🦐 🐥 🐥 🐥 🐥 🐥 🕷 → column3 is 🐥.\n\nRow2: 🦃 🐥 🦐 🐥 🦃 🦐 🎁 → column3 is 🐥.\n\nRow3: 🦜 🕷 🐥 🐥 🐥 🎁 🦐 → column3 is 🐥 (third index in the row is column3?)\n\nWait, rows are lists, so for example:\n\nRow3: index0 is 🦜, index1 is 🕷, index2 is 🐥, index3 is 🐥, index4 is 🐥, etc. So column3 is the fourth element (indices start at 0?), so column3 is the fourth emoji. For row3, column3 is 🐥.\n\nSo column3 for each row:\n\nRow0: column3 is 🕷.\n\nRow1: column3 is 🐥 (since row1's third emoji is 🐥 in the fourth position. Wait, let me list row1's emojis as:\n\nrow1: 0: 🦐, 1: 🐥, 2: 🐥, 3: 🐥, 4: 🐥, 5: 🐥, 6: 🕷.\n\nSo column3 is the fourth emoji (index3) which is 🐥.\n\nRow2: column3 is 🐥.\n\nRow3: column3 is 🐥.\n\nRow4: column3 is 🦐 (row4 is 🎁, 🦜, 🦐, 🦐, 🐥, 🕷, 🐥. So index3 is 🦐.)\n\nWait, no. Row4's emojis are:\n\nRow4: 🎁 (0), 🦜 (1), 🦐 (2), 🦐 (3), 🐥 (4), 🕷 (5), 🐥 (6). So column3 is index3 → 🦐.\n\nSo in column3, the emojis are:\n\nRow0: 🕷\n\nRow1: 🐥\n\nRow2: 🐥\n\nRow3: 🐥\n\nRow4: 🦐\n\nRow5: 🦜 (row5: 🦐, 🎁, 🦐, 🦜, 🦃, 🎁, 🦐. So column3 is 🦜.)\n\nRow6: 🦃 (row6's column3: third emoji. Row6: 🐥, 🎁, 🕷, 🦃, ... → column3 is 🦃 (index3 is 🦃).\n\nSo column3's emojis are:\n\nRow0: 🕷\n\nRow1: 🐥\n\nRow2: 🐥\n\nRow3: 🐥\n\nRow4: 🦐\n\nRow5: 🦜\n\nRow6: 🦃\n\nSo consecutive same in column3:\n\nRow1, row2, row3: 🐥, 🐥, 🐥. That's a run of three. So vertical line here. Count 1.\n\nWait, but row0 is 🕷. So row0 (🕷) and row1 (🐥) are different. Then rows1,2,3: three 🐥. So from row1 to row3, they are consecutive. So that's a vertical line of length 3. So count 1.\n\nYes, that's correct. So column3 contributes 1.\n\nWait, then in column3, there's a run from row1 to row3. So that's three same emojis vertically. So that's one vertical line. Correct.\n\nSo the vertical lines count for column3 is 1.\n\nSo vertical lines sum to 7.\n\nSo total lines is 4 +7=11. So the answer is 11.\n\nBut wait, wait another thing: are vertical lines in column1 rows5-6 🎁🎁? Let's check row5 and row6, column1.\n\nWait, column1's rows5 and 6: row5 is 🎁 in column1? Let me check.\n\nColumn1 is the second emoji in each row (since indexes start at 0).\n\nRow5: 🦐 (0), 🎁 (1), 🦐 (2), etc. So column1 is 🎁. Row6: 🐥 (0), 🎁 (1), 🕷 (2), ... → column1 is 🎁.\n\nSo row5 column1 is 🎁, row6 column1 is 🎁. So that's two in a row. So vertical line of 2. So counted as 1. Correct. So column1's vertical lines are 2: one for rows1-2 (🐥🐥), and another for rows5-6 (🎁🎁). Correct.\n\nSo everything seems right. So the answer should be 11.\n\n\nAnswer: 11"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The lines have to be of length 2 or more. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the board is given as 10 rows, each with 10 emojis. So it's a 10x10 grid. The lines can be horizontal (same row, consecutive same emojis) or vertical (same column, consecutive same emojis). But lines are counted as separate if they are part of longer lines. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more. So each individual line of length >=2 contributes to the count. For example, if there's a horizontal line of 3 same emojis in a row, that counts as two lines: one of length 3, but wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, no—if a line is of length 3, how many lines does that count as? Because a line of length 3 would contain two overlapping lines of length 2, but I think the problem considers the entire contiguous line as a single line. Wait, the question says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So any contiguous sequence of the same emoji, horizontally or vertically, that is length 2 or longer counts as a single line. So for example, a horizontal line of 3 same emojis in a row would count as one line of length 3. So each such contiguous sequence is counted once, regardless of how many longer sequences it's part of.\n\nWait, but sometimes people might count each possible sub-line. But according to standard problem definitions, a line is a maximal consecutive sequence. So for example, in a row like 🐑🐑🐑, that's a single line of length 3. So that would add 1 to the count. So the approach is to check all horizontal lines and vertical lines for contiguous sequences of same emojis with length >=2. Each such sequence is counted once.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Iterate through each row. For each row, scan left to right, checking consecutive emojis. Whenever the current emoji is the same as the previous, we check how long the current run is. For example, in a row like A A A B B, the horizontal lines would be two: a line of 3 A's and a line of 2 B's.\n\nBut wait, how to count each line. Let's take the first row: ⛅️🦟🌰🌈🌾😃🦚🐑😃🦚. Let's look for horizontal lines here.\n\nLet me check each consecutive pair. Row 1 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?) Let's think of rows as starting from 0 to 9. Let's take the first row: the first element is ⛅️, followed by 🦟. They are different. Then 🦟 to next, etc. So in this first row, are there any horizontal lines? Let's see:\n\nRow 0: ⛅️, 🦟, 🌰, 🌈, 🌾, 😃, 🦚, 🐑, 😃, 🦚. All adjacent pairs in this row are different. So no horizontal lines here.\n\nThen look at row 1: 🦚, 🐊, 🌾, ⛅️, 🦚, 🌰, 🌈, ⛅️, 😃, ⛅️. Looking for consecutive same emojis. Let's check each pair:\n\n🦚 and 🐊: different. 🐊 and 🌾: different. 🌾 and ⛅️: different. ⛅️ and 🦚: different. 🦚 and 🌰: different. 🌰 and 🌈: different. 🌈 and ⛅️: different. ⛅️ and 😃: different. 😃 and ⛅️: different. So no horizontal lines here.\n\nRow 2: 🦉, 🐊, 🐊, 😃, ⛅️, 🦉, 🐊, 😃, 🦉, 🦟. Let's check consecutive pairs. The first pair is 🦉 and 🐊: different. Then 🐊 and 🐊: same. So here's a possible horizontal line. Let's see how long this run is. The first two are different, then positions 1 and 2 (assuming 0-based) are 🐊 and 🐊. Then position 3 is 😃. So the run is two 🐊s. So that's a horizontal line of length 2. Then later in the same row, after position 5 (🦉), position 6 is 🐊. But the next is 😃. So another pair at positions 6 and 7 (🐊 and 😃): different. Then position 7 (😃) and 8 (🦉): different. Position 8 and 9: different. So in row 2, there is one horizontal line of length 2 (the two 🐊s at positions 1 and 2). So that's +1 to the count.\n\nThen row 3: 🌾, 🐊, 🌾, 😃, 🌾, 😃, 🐑, 🦚, 🌾, 🐊. Let's check adjacent pairs. \n\nFirst pair: 🌾 and 🐊: different. Then 🐊 and 🌾: different. 🌾 and 😃: different. 😃 and 🌾: different. 🌾 and 😃: different. 😃 and 🐑: different. 🐑 and 🦚: different. 🦚 and 🌾: different. 🌾 and 🐊: different. So no horizontal lines here.\n\nRow 4: 😃, ⛅️, 🌈, 🌾, ⛅️, 🌈, 🐊, 🐊, 🦟, 🌾. Let's check adjacent pairs. \n\n😃 and ⛅️: different. ⛅️ and 🌈: different. 🌈 and 🌾: different. 🌾 and ⛅️: different. ⛅️ and 🌈: different. 🌈 and 🐊: different. 🐊 and 🐊: same. So positions 6 and 7 (🐊🐊) are same. That's a horizontal line of length 2. So +1. Then 🐊 and 🦟: different. So row 4 has one horizontal line.\n\nRow 5: ⛅️, 🦚, 🌰, 🌾, 🌰, ⛅️, 🌈, 🐑, 🌰, 🐊. Adjacent pairs: all different. No horizontal lines here.\n\nRow 6: 😃, ⛅️, 😃, 🐊, ⛅️, 🌈, 🦚, 🦚, 🌈, 🌾. Let's check. \n\n😃 and ⛅️: different. ⛅️ and 😃: different. 😃 and 🐊: different. 🐊 and ⛅️: different. ⛅️ and 🌈: different. 🌈 and 🦚: different. 🦚 and 🦚: same. Positions 6 and 7 (🦚🦚) same. That's a horizontal line of length 2. Then positions 7 and 8: 🦚 and 🌈: different. So that's another +1.\n\nRow 7: 🌾, 🦉, 🌰, 🌈, 🦚, 🦉, 🌈, 🌾, ⛅️, 😃. All adjacent pairs seem different. So no horizontal lines here.\n\nRow 8: 🐊, 🦚, 🌈, 🌰, 🌾, 🦟, 🌰, 🌈, 🌈, ⛅️. Let's check:\n\n🐊 and 🦚: different. 🦚 and 🌈: different. 🌈 and 🌰: different. 🌰 and 🌾: different. 🌾 and 🦟: different. 🦟 and 🌰: different. 🌰 and 🌈: different. 🌈 and 🌈: same. Positions 7 and 8 (🌈🌈) are same. Then 8 and 9 (🌈 and ⛅️): different. So here's a horizontal line of length 2. So +1.\n\nRow 9: 🦟, ⛅️, 🌈, 🦟, 🐑, 🐊, 😃, 🐊, 🌈, 🌾. All adjacent pairs seem different. So no horizontal lines here.\n\nSo total horizontal lines found are in rows 2,4,6,8. That's 4 horizontal lines.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nRow 2: 1 line (positions 1-2, 🐊🐊)\n\nRow 4: 1 line (positions 6-7, 🐊🐊)\n\nRow 6: 1 line (positions 6-7, 🦚🦚)\n\nRow 8: 1 line (positions 7-8, 🌈🌈)\n\nSo 4 horizontal lines so far.\n\nNow, check vertical lines. Each column has 10 emojis. For each column, check consecutive same emojis in the vertical direction.\n\nFor example, column 0: the first elements of each row. Let's list them:\n\nRow 0: ⛅️\n\nRow 1: 🦚\n\nRow 2: 🦉\n\nRow 3: 🌾\n\nRow 4: 😃\n\nRow 5: ⛅️\n\nRow 6: 😃\n\nRow 7: 🌾\n\nRow 8: 🐊\n\nRow 9: 🦟\n\nSo column 0: ⛅️, 🦚, 🦉, 🌾, 😃, ⛅️, 😃, 🌾, 🐊, 🦟. All are different vertically. So no vertical lines here.\n\nColumn 1: each row's second element.\n\nRow 0: 🦟\n\nRow1: 🐊\n\nRow2: 🐊\n\nRow3: 🐊\n\nRow4: ⛅️\n\nRow5: 🦚\n\nRow6: ⛅️\n\nRow7: 🦉\n\nRow8: 🦚\n\nRow9: ⛅️\n\nLooking for vertical sequences. Let's check each pair down the column.\n\nRow0 col1: 🦟. Row1: 🐊. Different. Row1 to row2: 🐊 to 🐊: same. So vertical line starting here. How long is it? Row1: 🐊, row2: 🐊, row3: 🐊. So rows 1-3: three same emojis. So that's a vertical line of length 3. So that's one vertical line. Then row4 col1 is ⛅️, which is different. So the vertical line in column 1 is from rows 1-3 (three 🐊s). That counts as one line of length 3. So +1.\n\nThen in column 1, rows 5 is 🦚, row6 is ⛅️. No other sequences here. So column 1 contributes 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn 2: looking at each row's third element.\n\nRow0: 🌰\n\nRow1: 🌾\n\nRow2: 🐊\n\nRow3: 🌾\n\nRow4: 🌈\n\nRow5: 🌰\n\nRow6: 😃\n\nRow7: 🌰\n\nRow8: 🌈\n\nRow9: 🌈\n\nSo checking vertical sequences. Row0 to row1: different. Row1 to row2: 🌾 vs 🐊: different. Row2 to row3: 🐊 vs 🌾: different. Row3 to row4: 🌾 vs 🌈: different. Row4 to row5: 🌈 vs 🌰: different. Row5 to row6: 🌰 vs 😃: different. Row6 to row7: 😃 vs 🌰: different. Row7 to row8: 🌰 vs 🌈: different. Row8 to row9: 🌈 vs 🌈: same. So in rows 8 and 9 of column 2: 🌈 and 🌈. That's a vertical line of length 2. So +1.\n\nSo column 2 contributes 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn3: fourth elements of each row.\n\nRow0: 🌈\n\nRow1: ⛅️\n\nRow2: 😃\n\nRow3: 😃\n\nRow4: 🌾\n\nRow5: 🌾\n\nRow6: 🐊\n\nRow7: 🌈\n\nRow8: 🌰\n\nRow9: 🦟\n\nCheck vertical sequences:\n\nRow0: 🌈, row1: ⛅️: different. row1 to row2: ⛅️ vs 😃: different. row2: 😃, row3: 😃: same. So from row2 to row3, two 😃s. That's a vertical line of length 2. +1. Then row3 to row4: 😃 vs 🌾: different. Then row4 to row5: 🌾 vs 🌾: same. So rows4 and 5 in column3: 🌾 and 🌾. Another vertical line of length 2. +1. Then row5 to row6: 🌾 vs 🐊: different. row6 to row7: 🐊 vs 🌈: different. row7 to row8: 🌈 vs 🌰: different. row8 to row9: 🌰 vs 🦟: different. So column3 has two vertical lines: from rows2-3 (😃😃) and rows4-5 (🌾🌾). So that's +2.\n\nColumn4: fifth elements.\n\nRow0: 🌾\n\nRow1: 🦚\n\nRow2: ⛅️\n\nRow3: 🌾\n\nRow4: ⛅️\n\nRow5: 🌰\n\nRow6: ⛅️\n\nRow7: 🦚\n\nRow8: 🌾\n\nRow9: 🐑\n\nCheck vertical sequences:\n\nRow0: 🌾, row1: 🦚: different. row1: 🦚, row2: ⛅️: different. row2: ⛅️, row3: 🌾: different. row3: 🌾, row4: ⛅️: different. row4: ⛅️, row5: 🌰: different. row5: 🌰, row6: ⛅️: different. row6: ⛅️, row7: 🦚: different. row7: 🦚, row8: 🌾: different. row8: 🌾, row9: 🐑: different. So no vertical lines here.\n\nColumn5: sixth elements.\n\nRow0: 😃\n\nRow1: 🌰\n\nRow2: 🦉\n\nRow3: 😃\n\nRow4: 🌈\n\nRow5: ⛅️\n\nRow6: 🌈\n\nRow7: 🦉\n\nRow8: 🦟\n\nRow9: 🐊\n\nCheck sequences:\n\nRow0: 😃, row1: 🌰: different. row1: 🌰, row2: 🦉: different. row2: 🦉, row3: 😃: different. row3: 😃, row4: 🌈: different. row4: 🌈, row5: ⛅️: different. row5: ⛅️, row6: 🌈: different. row6: 🌈, row7: 🦉: different. row7: 🦉, row8: 🦟: different. row8: 🦟, row9: 🐊: different.

No vertical lines.\n\nColumn7: eighth elements.\n\nRow0: 🐑\n\nRow1: ⛅️\n\nRow2: 😃\n\nRow3: 🦚\n\nRow4: 🐊\n\nRow5: 🐑\n\nRow6: 🦚\n\nRow7: 🌾\n\nRow8: 🌈\n\nRow9: 🐊\n\nCheck sequences:\n\nRow0: 🐑, row1: ⛅️: different. row1: ⛅️, row2: 😃: different. row2: 😃, row3: 🦚: different. row3: 🦚, row4: 🐊: different. row4: 🐊, row5: 🐑: different. row5: 🐑, row6: 🦚: different. row6: 🦚, row7: 🌾: different. row7: 🌾, row8: 🌈: different. row8: 🌈, row9: 🐊: different. No vertical lines here.\n\nColumn8: ninth elements.\n\nRow0: 😃\n\nRow1: 😃\n\nRow2: 🦉\n\nRow3: 🌾\n\nRow4: 🦟\n\nRow5: 🌰\n\nRow6: 🌈\n\nRow7: ⛅️\n\nRow8: 🌈\n\nRow9: 🌈\n\nCheck vertical sequences:\n\nRow0: 😃, row1: 😃: same. So rows 0-1: 😃😃. That's a vertical line of length 2. Then row1 to row2: 😃 vs 🦉: different. So column8 contributes +1 here. Then row2: 🦉, row3: 🌾: different. row3: 🌾, row4: 🦟: different. row4: 🦟, row5: 🌰: different. row5: 🌰, row6: 🌈: different. row6: 🌈, row7: ⛅️: different. row7: ⛅️, row8: 🌈: different. row8: 🌈, row9: 🌈: same. So rows8-9: 🌈🌈. Another vertical line of length 2. So column8 has two vertical lines: rows0-1 (😃😃) and rows8-9 (🌈🌈). So +2.\n\nColumn9: tenth elements.\n\nRow0: 🦚\n\nRow1: ⛅️\n\nRow2: 🦟\n\nRow3: 🐊\n\nRow4: 🌾\n\nRow5: 🐊\n\nRow6: 🌾\n\nRow7: 😃\n\nRow8: ⛅️\n\nRow9: 🌾\n\nCheck vertical sequences:\n\nRow0: 🦚, row1: ⛅️: different. row1: ⛅️, row2: 🦟: different. row2: 🦟, row3: 🐊: different. row3: 🐊, row4: 🌾: different. row4: 🌾, row5: 🐊: different. row5: 🐊, row6: 🌾: different. row6: 🌾, row7: 😃: different. row7: 😃, row8: ⛅️: different. row8: ⛅️, row9: 🌾: different. No vertical lines here.\n\nSo summing up the vertical lines:\n\nColumn1: 1 line (length 3)\n\nColumn2: 1 line (length 2)\n\nColumn3: 2 lines (rows2-3 and rows4-5)\n\nColumn8: 2 lines (rows0-1 and rows8-9)\n\nTotal vertical lines: 1 +1 +2 +2 =6?\n\nWait, let's recount:\n\nColumn1: 1\n\nColumn2:1\n\nColumn3:2\n\nColumn8:2\n\nSo 1+1=2, +2=4, +2=6. So vertical lines total 6.\n\nSo horizontal lines: 4. Vertical lines:6. Total is 4+6=10? But wait, I think I might have missed some vertical lines. Let's recheck each column again.\n\nWait, column3:\n\nRow0: 🌈\n\nRow1: ⛅️\n\nRow2: 😃\n\nRow3: 😃\n\nRow4: 🌾\n\nRow5: 🌾\n\nRow6: 🐊\n\nRow7: 🌈\n\nRow8: 🌰\n\nRow9: 🦟\n\nSo vertical pairs:\n\nRow2 and row3: both 😃. So a vertical line of length 2. Then row4 and row5: both 🌾. Another vertical line of length 2. So two lines in column3. Correct.\n\nColumn8: rows0 and1: 😃 and 😃. Then rows8 and9: 🌈 and 🌈. So two lines. Correct.\n\nColumn2: rows8 and9 of column2 are 🌈 and 🌈. So yes, one line.\n\nWait, column2's rows are:\n\nRow0: 🌰\n\nRow1: 🌾\n\nRow2: 🐊\n\nRow3: 🌾\n\nRow4: 🌈\n\nRow5: 🌰\n\nRow6: 😃\n\nRow7: 🌰\n\nRow8: 🌈\n\nRow9: 🌈\n\nSo looking at column2: rows8 and9 are 🌈 and 🌈. So vertical line from rows8 to9. So yes, one line. Correct.\n\nColumn1: rows1-3: 🐊, 🐊, 🐊. So that's a vertical line of length 3. Correct.\n\nWhat about other columns?\n\nColumn6: any vertical lines? Let's check again.\n\nColumn6 (7th elements):\n\nRow0: 🦚\n\nRow1: 🌈\n\nRow2: 🐊\n\nRow3: 🐑\n\nRow4: 🐊\n\nRow5: 🌈\n\nRow6: 🦚\n\nRow7: 🌈\n\nRow8: 🌰\n\nRow9: 😃\n\nCheck vertical sequences. Any same consecutive in vertical?\n\nRow0: 🦚, row1: 🌈: no.\n\nRow1: 🌈, row2: 🐊: no.\n\nRow2: 🐊, row3: 🐑: no.\n\nRow3: 🐑, row4: 🐊: no.\n\nRow4: 🐊, row5: 🌈: no.\n\nRow5: 🌈, row6: 🦚: no.\n\nRow6: 🦚, row7: 🌈: no.\n\nRow7: 🌈, row8: 🌰: no.\n\nRow8: 🌰, row9: 😃: no.\n\nNo lines here. So vertical lines are indeed 6.\n\nSo adding horizontal and vertical lines, 4+6=10. Wait wait, but the initial calculation of horizontal lines was 4. Let me recheck the horizontal lines.\n\nLet me list each row again for horizontal lines:\n\nRow0: all different. No lines.\n\nRow1: all different. No lines.\n\nRow2: 🦉, 🐊, 🐊, 😃, ⛅️, 🦉, 🐊, 😃, 🦉, 🦟. The two 🐊s at positions 1-2: yes. So +1.\n\nRow3: 🌾, 🐊, 🌾, 😃, 🌾, 😃, 🐑, 🦚, 🌾, 🐊. All different. No lines.\n\nRow4: 😃, ⛅️, 🌈, 🌾, ⛅️, 🌈, 🐊, 🐊, 🦟, 🌾. The two 🐊s at 6-7: yes. +1.\n\nRow5: ⛅️, 🦚, 🌰, 🌾, 🌰, ⛅️, 🌈, 🐑, 🌰, 🐊. All different.\n\nRow6: 😃, ⛅️, 😃, 🐊, ⛅️, 🌈, 🦚, 🦚, 🌈, 🌾. The two 🦚s at 6-7: yes. +1.\n\nRow7: all different.\n\nRow8: 🐊, 🦚, 🌈, 🌰, 🌾, 🦟, 🌰, 🌈, 🌈, ⛅️. The two 🌈s at 7-8: yes. +1.\n\nRow9: all different.\n\nSo horizontal lines are 4. Correct.\n\nSo horizontal lines:4, vertical lines:6. Total 10.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.\n\nWait, another possible mistake: the vertical lines might have more lines. Let's take column3 again. In column3, the two sequences are rows2-3 and rows4-5. That's two lines. Column8: two lines. Column1: one. Column2: one. So 1+1+2+2=6. Correct.\n\nHmm. So total 10.\n\nBut I need to make sure that for vertical lines, the code is checking for runs. For example, in column1, the three consecutive 🐊s would count as a single line of length 3. So that's one line. Then in column3, two separate lines of length 2 (rows2-3 and rows4-5), each counted once. So two. So total 6 vertical lines.\n\nSo total answer is 4+6=10. So the answer should be 10. Wait, but wait! Let me check another possible error.\n\nWait, in vertical line column8, rows0-1 and rows8-9: two separate lines, correct. So column8 contributes two. Column3 contributes two. Column1 one, column2 one. Total 2+2+1+1=6. Correct.\n\nSo adding horizontal and vertical, 4+6=10. So the answer is 10. But I need to check again.\n\nAnother example: in column3, rows2-3 are 😃 and 😃. So that's one line. Then rows4-5 are 🌾 and 🌾. So yes, two lines. Column8: rows0-1 and rows8-9. Each is a line. So yes.\n\nAnother possible error: I might have missed vertical lines in other columns.\n\nLet me check column7 again. Column7's elements:\n\nRow0: 🐑\n\nRow1: ⛅️\n\nRow2: 😃\n\nRow3: 🦚\n\nRow4: 🐊\n\nRow5: 🐑\n\nRow6: 🦚\n\nRow7: 🌾\n\nRow8: 🌈\n\nRow9: 🐊\n\nNo vertical lines here.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow0: 🌾\n\nRow1: 🦚\n\nRow2: ⛅️\n\nRow3: 🌾\n\nRow4: ⛅️\n\nRow5: 🌰\n\nRow6: ⛅️\n\nRow7: 🦚\n\nRow8: 🌾\n\nRow9: 🐑\n\nNo consecutive same in vertical.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow0: 😃\n\nRow1: 🌰\n\nRow2: 🦉\n\nRow3: 😃\n\nRow4: 🌈\n\nRow5: ⛅️\n\nRow6: 🌈\n\nRow7: 🦉\n\nRow8: 🦟\n\nRow9: 🐊\n\nNo vertical lines here.\n\nColumn6: checked earlier.\n\nSo yes, vertical lines are 6. Horizontal 4. Total 10. So the answer should be 10.\n\nBut wait, what about row 6's horizontal line? Row6 is:\n\n😃, ⛅️, 😃, 🐊, ⛅️, 🌈, 🦚, 🦚, 🌈, 🌾.\n\nThe 🦚s are at positions 6 and7 (indices 6 and7, 0-based). So that's a line of two.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the answer is 10. But I'm a bit nervous. Let me recount all vertical lines again.\n\nColumn1: rows1,2,3 are 🐊,🐊,🐊. So vertical line of length 3. Counts as 1.\n\nColumn2: rows8 and9 are 🌈,🌈. Counts as 1.\n\nColumn3:\n\nrows2-3: 😃,😃 → 1.\n\nrows4-5: 🌾,🌾 → 1. So column3: 2.\n\nColumn8:\n\nrows0-1: 😃,😃 →1.\n\nrows8-9: 🌈,🌈 →1. Column8:2.\n\nTotal vertical lines: 1+1+2+2=6.\n\nYes. So 6 vertical.\n\nHorizontal lines:4.\n\nTotal 10. So the answer is 10.\n\n\nAnswer: 10"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines made of the same emoji that are length 2 or more. Hmm. So the board is given as a grid of emojis, right? Let me first visualize the board properly.\n\nThe board is 5 rows by 5 columns. Let me write them out row by row:\n\nRow 1: 🧽, 🌱, 🌙, 🌙, 🧽\nRow 2: 🧽, 🧽, 🌱, 🌙, 🌙\nRow 3: 🌱, 🧽, 🧽, 🌙, 🌙\nRow 4: 🌱, 🧽, 🌙, 🧽, 🌙\nRow 5: 🌱, 🧽, 🧽, 🧽, 🧽\n\nNow, I need to check both horizontal and vertical lines. For each line (either in a row or column), any consecutive same emojis of length 2 or more count as a line. But wait, how do overlapping lines work? Like, if a row has three same emojis in a row, that's one line of length 3. But each line is considered as a single instance regardless of its length, as long as it's at least 2? Or does each possible consecutive pair count as a separate line?\n\nWait, the problem statement says \"number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So each such line, whether it's part of a longer line. But how are lines counted? Like, a line of 3 in a row (horizontal) would count as one line. But if there's another line of same emoji in a different row or column, etc. Wait, perhaps each maximal consecutive sequence counts as one line. For example, in a horizontal row, a sequence of three same emojis is considered a single line of length 3. So each such maximal sequence in horizontal or vertical direction counts as one line. So the total count is the number of such sequences.\n\nSo, for example, in row 2: 🧽, 🧽, ... So two consecutive 🧽s. That's a horizontal line of length 2. Then in row 5, there are four 🧽s in a row. So that's a horizontal line of length 4.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So each contiguous sequence of same emojis in a row (horizontal) or column (vertical) that is at least 2 in length. So each such sequence contributes +1 to the count. For example, a horizontal line of 4 same emojis is one line. A vertical line of 3 same emojis is another line.\n\nSo my task is to iterate through each row and check for consecutive same emojis in the horizontal direction, then iterate through each column and check for consecutive same emojis in the vertical direction. For each row, split into sequences where the emoji is the same, and count each such sequence with length >=2. Then same for columns.\n\nSo let's break it down.\n\nFirst, process all horizontal lines. For each row in the board:\n\nRow 1: 🧽, 🌱, 🌙, 🌙, 🧽\n\nLooking for consecutive same emojis. Let's go step by step:\n\nPosition 0: 🧽. Next is 🌱 (different). So no horizontal line here.\n\nThen position 1: 🌱. Next is 🌙 (different). No.\n\nPosition 2: 🌙, next is same (🌙). So that's a sequence of 2. Then position 3 is same as 2, but after that position 4 is 🧽. So in row 1, the horizontal lines are the sequence from 2-3 (🌙🌙). So that's 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow 2: 🧽, 🧽, 🌱, 🌙, 🌙\n\nFirst two 🧽s: that's a sequence of 2 → count 1.\n\nThen positions 3-4: 🌙🌙 → another sequence of 2 → count another. So total horizontal lines in row 2: 2.\n\nRow 3: 🌱, 🧽, 🧽, 🌙, 🌙\n\nHere, positions 1-2 are 🧽🧽 (count 1), and positions 3-4 are 🌙🌙 (count 1). So total 2.\n\nRow 4: 🌱, 🧽, 🌙, 🧽, 🌙\n\nLooking for consecutive same. Check each pair:\n\n🌱 and 🧽: different. 🧽 and 🌙: different. 🌙 and 🧽: different. 🧽 and 🌙: different. So no horizontal sequences here. So row 4 contributes 0.\n\nRow 5: 🌱, 🧽, 🧽, 🧽, 🧽\n\nPositions 1-4 are all 🧽. So a sequence of 4. That's 1 horizontal line.\n\nSo total horizontal lines: 1 (row1) + 2 (row2) + 2 (row3) + 0 (row4) +1 (row5) → sum to 6 horizontal lines.\n\nNow check vertical lines. For each column (5 columns), check each cell and the cells below to see consecutive same.\n\nColumn 0 (all rows 0-4):\n\nRow 0: 🧽\n\nRow1: 🧽\n\nRow2: 🌱\n\nRow3: 🌱\n\nRow4: 🌱\n\nSo looking for vertical sequences. Let's see:\n\nRow0 to row1: 🧽 and 🧽 (same → sequence of 2) → count 1. Then row1 to row2: 🧽 vs 🌱 (diff). So vertical line of length 2 in column 0.\n\nThen from row2 to row3: 🌱 and 🌱 (same). Then row3 to row4: 🌱 and 🌱 (same). So from row2 to row3 to row4: three same. So a sequence of 3, which is a vertical line. So column0 has two vertical lines? Wait, no. Wait, vertical sequences are sequences along the same column. So in column0, the first two rows are 🧽🧽 → sequence of 2. Then the next three rows (2,3,4) are 🌱🌱🌱 → sequence of 3. So that's two vertical lines in column0.\n\nWait, but each vertical line is a maximal consecutive sequence. So in column0, first two are 🧽s (2-length), then three 🌱s (3-length). So total two vertical lines in column0.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow0: 🌱\n\nRow1: 🧽\n\nRow2: 🧽\n\nRow3: 🧽\n\nRow4: 🧽\n\nSo column1:\n\nRow0: 🌱. Then row1 is 🧽, so different. Then rows1-4 are all 🧽. So rows1-4: 4 🧽s in a row. So that's a vertical line of length 4. So column1 has one vertical line.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: 🌙\n\nRow1: 🌱\n\nRow2: 🧽\n\nRow3: 🌙\n\nRow4: 🧽\n\nCheck for vertical sequences. Each row in column2:\n\nRow0: 🌙, row1: 🌱 (diff). Then row1: 🌱, row2: 🧽 (diff). Row2: 🧽, row3: 🌙 (diff). Row3: 🌙, row4: 🧽 (diff). So no consecutive same in vertical. So column2 has 0 vertical lines.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🌙\n\nRow1: 🌙\n\nRow2: 🌙\n\nRow3: 🧽\n\nRow4: 🧽\n\nSo check:\n\nRow0-1-2: 🌙, same? Let's see:\n\nRow0: 🌙, row1: 🌙 → same (length 2). Then row2: 🌙 → same, so sequence becomes 3. Then row3: 🧽 (different). So vertical line of length3 here (rows0-2). Then row3 and row4 are 🧽🧽 → length2. So column3 has two vertical lines: one of length3 and one of length2.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow0: 🧽\n\nRow1: 🌙\n\nRow2: 🌙\n\nRow3: 🌙\n\nRow4: 🧽\n\nCheck vertical sequences:\n\nRow0: 🧽. Row1: 🌙 → different. Then rows1-2-3: 🌙🌙🌙 → sequence of 3. Then row4: 🧽 → different. So column4 has one vertical line (rows1-3) of length3. Also, row4 is separate.\n\nSo vertical lines count:\n\nColumn0: 2 lines.\n\nColumn1: 1 line.\n\nColumn2: 0.\n\nColumn3: 2 lines.\n\nColumn4: 1 line.\n\nTotal vertical lines: 2+1+0+2+1=6.\n\nSo total lines (horizontal + vertical) = 6 +6=12.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check each column again.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🌙\n\nRow1: 🌙\n\nRow2: 🌙\n\nRow3: 🧽\n\nRow4: 🧽\n\nSo the first three rows (0-1-2) are 🌙 → length3. Then rows3-4 are 🧽 → length2. So yes, two vertical lines here.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow0: 🧽\n\nRow1: 🌙\n\nRow2: 🌙\n\nRow3: 🌙\n\nRow4: 🧽\n\nRow1-2-3 are 🌙 (3-length). So that's one vertical line. So column4 contributes 1.\n\nSo vertical lines sum to 2 (col0) +1 (col1) +0 (col2)+ 2 (col3) +1 (col4) → total 6.\n\nSo horizontal lines were 6, vertical lines 6 → total 12.\n\nBut wait, let me recheck each row's horizontal counts again.\n\nRow1: 🧽, 🌱, 🌙, 🌙, 🧽 → the 🌙🌙 is length2 → count 1.\n\nRow2: 🧽🧽, 🌱, 🌙🌙 → two sequences → count 2.\n\nRow3: 🧽🧽, 🌙🌙 → two sequences → count 2.\n\nRow4: no sequences → 0.\n\nRow5: 🧽 four times → one sequence → count1.\n\nWait, rows are 0-based or 1-based? The problem lists the board as:\n\nboard:\n\nRow1: 🧽🌱🌙🌙🧽\n\nRow2: 🧽🧽🌱🌙🌙\n\nRow3: 🌱🧽🧽🌙🌙\n\nRow4: 🌱🧽🌙🧽🌙\n\nRow5: 🌱🧽🧽🧽🧽\n\nWait, in code, the first row is index 0. So the user's input is 5 rows. So when processing, each row is checked for horizontal sequences.\n\nBut when I counted row 5 (the fifth row given by the user, which is row index 4 in code terms?), let's see:\n\nRow5 (user's last row) is 🌱🧽🧽🧽🧽 → so the emojis are 🌱, 🧽, 🧽, 🧽, 🧽.\n\nSo in that row, the sequence starts at position1 (🧽) and continues to the end. That's a sequence of 4 → so count 1 horizontal line. So yes, row5 (in user's numbering, which is row index4) contributes 1.\n\nSo horizontal lines sum to:\n\nRow 0 (user's first row):1.\n\nRow1:2.\n\nRow2:2.\n\nRow3:0.\n\nRow4:1.\n\nTotal 1+2+2+0+1=6.\n\nVertical lines sum to 6.\n\nSo total lines 6+6=12.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the vertical lines for column0.\n\nColumn0:\n\nRow0: 🧽\n\nRow1: 🧽\n\nRow2: 🌱\n\nRow3: 🌱\n\nRow4: 🌱\n\nSo the first two are 🧽, then three 🌱s.\n\nSo vertical sequences:\n\nThe first two rows: 🧽🧽 → length2 → count1.\n\nThen the next three rows: 🌱🌱🌱 → length3 → count1.\n\nTotal 2 vertical lines in column0.\n\nYes. So 2.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRows0:🌙, 1:🌙, 2:🌙 → 3-length → count1.\n\nRows3:🧽, 4:🧽 → 2-length → count1.\n\nTotal 2.\n\nSo vertical lines sum to 6. So total is 12.\n\nHmm. But when I check the answer, perhaps there's an error. Let me check again.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps I should check each possible line (horizontal and vertical) for each possible consecutive pair or longer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem considers a line as any run of two or more, and each run is counted once regardless of how long it is. So for example, a run of 4 in a row (horizontal) counts as 1 line, not three (since each of length 2,3,4). So the initial approach is correct.\n\nSo the answer would be 6 (horizontal) +6 (vertical) =12.\n\nBut let me check with a detailed breakdown.\n\nHorizontal lines:\n\nRow1 (user's first row):\n\nSequence in positions 2-3 (🌙🌙) → 1 line.\n\nRow2:\n\nPositions 0-1 (🧽🧽) → 1 line.\n\nPositions3-4 (🌙🌙) → 1 line. Total 2.\n\nRow3:\n\nPositions1-2 (🧽🧽) → 1 line.\n\nPositions3-4 (🌙🌙) → 1 line. Total 2.\n\nRow4: no sequences.\n\nRow5:\n\nPositions1-4 (🧽🧽🧽🧽) → 1 line.\n\nSo 1+2+2+0+1=6.\n\nVertical lines:\n\nColumn0:\n\nRows0-1 (🧽🧽) → 1 line.\n\nRows2-4 (🌱🌱🌱) → 1 line. Total 2.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRows1-4 (🧽🧽🧽🧽) → 1 line (since it's four in a row). So rows1,2,3,4 are all 🧽. So that's a sequence of length4 → 1 line.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRows0-2 (🌙🌙🌙) → 1 line.\n\nRows3-4 (🧽🧽) → 1 line. Total 2.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRows1-3 (🌙🌙🌙) →1 line.\n\nSo column4's vertical lines: rows1-3 (🌙) →3 length →1 line.\n\nOther columns:\n\nColumn2:\n\nNo sequences. So vertical lines sum to 2+1+0+2+1=6.\n\nSo total 6+6=12. So the answer should be 12. But I'm not 100% confident. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the vertical lines in column3:\n\nRow0: 🌙, row1: 🌙, row2: 🌙 → three in a row. Then rows3 and 4 are 🧽. So two in a row. So vertical lines in column3: two lines (the three 🌙s and the two 🧽s).\n\nYes. So column3 contributes 2.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRows1-3: three 🌙s → one line. So yes.\n\nSo vertical lines count:\n\nColumn0:2.\n\nColumn1:1.\n\nColumn2:0.\n\nColumn3:2.\n\nColumn4:1.\n\nTotal 6.\n\nSo 6+6=12.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 12.\n\n\nThe task is to count horizontal and vertical lines of the same emoji with length ≥2. \n\n**Horizontal Lines:**\n- **Row 1:** 🌙🌙 → 1 line.\n- **Row 2:** 🧽🧽 and 🌙🌙 → 2 lines.\n- **Row 3:** 🧽🧽 and 🌙🌙 → 2 lines.\n- **Row 4:** No sequences → 0 lines.\n- **Row 5:** 🧽🧽🧽🧽 → 1 line.\n**Total horizontal lines = 1 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 1 = 6.**\n\n**Vertical Lines:**\n- **Column 0:** 🧽🧽 and 🌱🌱🌱 → 2 lines.\n- **Column 1:** 🧽🧽🧽🧽 → 1 line.\n- **Column 2:** No sequences → 0 lines.\n- **Column 3:** 🌙🌙🌙 and 🧽🧽 → 2 lines.\n- **Column 4:** 🌙🌙🌙 → 1 line.\n**Total vertical lines = 2 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 6.**\n\n**Total lines = 6 (horizontal) + 6 (vertical) = 12.**\n\nAnswer: 12"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines made of the same emoji with length 2 or more on this board. Hmm. So first, I should probably look at each row for horizontal lines and each column for vertical lines.\n\nThe board is a 10x10 grid since each of the 10 lines has 10 emojis. So each row has 10 elements, and there are 10 rows. Similarly, each column has 10 elements.\n\nFor horizontal lines: For each row, I need to check consecutive emojis. Like, if there's a run of the same emoji that's 2 or longer. So for a row, I can track the current emoji and the count. Whenever the next emoji is the same, increment the count. If it changes, check if the current run is >=2. But wait, how do we count overlapping lines? For example, a run of 3 would have two lines (length 2 and 3), but maybe the problem counts each possible line. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". So a single run of 4 same emojis in a row would count as one line, right? Because it's a single line. Oh wait, maybe not. Wait, no. The line's length is the number of emojis. So a run of 3 would count as one line of length 3, which is >=2, so counts once. So each contiguous sequence (run) of same emojis in a row or column that is length 2 or more counts as one line. So each run contributes 1 to the total count, regardless of how long it is beyond 2.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor each row:\n- Split the row into runs of same emojis. For each run, if the length is >=2, add 1 to the count.\n\nFor each column:\n- Do the same: process each column as a sequence, split into runs. For each run of length >=2, add 1.\n\nTotal count is sum of horizontal and vertical lines.\n\nSo first, I need to process each row. Let's look at the given board row by row.\n\nLet me write down the rows again:\n\nRow 1: 🌊🌺🌚🪐✨🌺🌚🌹🍃🌊\nLooking for same consecutive emojis here. Let's check each emoji in order:\n\n1. 🌊 (1)\n2. 🌺 (diff from prev, so check previous run: 1. Not >=2. So reset. Current is 🌺, count 1.\n3. 🌚 (diff, reset. Count 1.\n4. 🪐 (diff, reset. count 1.\n5. ✨ (diff, reset. count 1.\n6. 🌺 (diff, reset. count 1.\n7. 🌚 (diff, reset. count 1.\n8. 🌹 (diff, reset. count 1.\n9. 🍃 (diff, reset. count 1.\n10. 🌊 (diff, reset. So no runs >=2 in this row. So row 1 contributes 0.\n\nRow 2: 🦟🪐🌊🌺🌊🍃🌹🌚🍃🍃\nLet's check:\n\n1. 🦟\n2. 🪐 (diff. run of 1 → no.\n3. 🌊 (diff. run of 1.\n4. 🌺 (diff. run 1.\n5. 🌊 (diff. run 1.\n6. 🍃 (diff. run 1.\n7. 🌹 (diff. run 1.\n8. 🌚 (diff. run 1.\n9. 🍃 (diff. run 1.\n10. 🍃 (same as prev. So run length 2. Add 1. So this row contributes 1.\n\nWait, positions 9 and 10 are 🍃🍃. So that's a run of 2 → counts. So row 2 has one horizontal line.\n\nRow3: 🐚🐚🌊🍃🪐🦗🪐🌊🐚🌹\nRow3:\n\n1. 🐚\n2. 🐚 (same. run length 2 → add 1. Then check rest.\n3. 🌊 (diff. So run ends. The previous run contributed 1.\n4. 🍃 (diff. run 1.\n5. 🪐 (diff. run 1.\n6. 🦗 (diff. run 1.\n7. 🪐 (diff. run 1.\n8. 🌊 (diff. run 1.\n9. 🐚 (diff. run 1.\n10. 🌹 (diff.

So run of 2 → add 1.\nThen positions7-8: 🐚🐚 → another run of 2 → add 1. So total for row6 is 2.\n\nSo in row6, two horizontal lines.\n\nRow7: 🦟🦟🦟🌚🌊🐚✨🦗🌚✨\nRow7:\n\n1-3: 🦟🦟🦟. Run of 3 → add 1. Then positions4-10:\n\nBut after that, the rest are different. So row7 contributes 1.\n\nRow8: 🦗🍃🦟🌚🌺🐚🌚🍃🍃🪐\nCheck consecutive:\n\nPositions9-10: 🍃🍃?

So row8 contributes 1.\n\nRow9: 🪐🌺🌹🐚🪐🌹🐚🌺🦟🦟\nLooking for consecutive same:\n\nAt the end, positions9-10: 🦟🦟. So run of 2 → add 1. Other emojis in the row are all different. So row9 contributes 1.\n\nRow10: 🌚🦟🦟🐚🍃✨🌊✨🍃🐚\nCheck:\n\nPositions2-3: 🦟🦟 → run of 2 → add 1. So row10 contributes 1.\n\nSo summing up the horizontal lines:\n\nRow1: 0\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:2\n\nRow7:1\n\nRow8:1\n\nRow9:1\n\nRow10:1\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 0+1+1+0+0+2+1+1+1+1 = 8?\n\nWait, 1+1=2; 2+2=4; +1=5; +1=6; +1=7; +1=8. Yes. So 8 horizontal lines.\n\nNow check vertical lines. Need to process each column as a sequence.\n\nThere are 10 columns. Let's process each column from top to bottom.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow1: 🌊\n\nRow2: 🦟\n\nRow3: 🐚\n\nRow4: 🐚\n\nRow5: ✨\n\nRow6: 🌚\n\nRow7: 🦟\n\nRow8: 🦗\n\nRow9: 🪐\n\nRow10: 🌚\n\nSo the sequence is 🌊, 🦟, 🐚, 🐚, ✨, 🌚, 🦟, 🦗, 🪐, 🌚.\n\nCheck consecutive same:\n\nLooking for runs. Let's list them:\n\n1. 🌊 (run starts, length 1.\n\n2. 🦟 (diff. run ends, no contribution.\n\n3. 🐚 (new run. length 1.\n\n4. 🐚 (same as prev. run becomes 2 → add 1. Then next.\n\n5. ✨ (diff. run ends. So column1 has a run of 2 (🐚🐚 in row3-4). So contributes 1.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow1: 🌺\n\nRow2: 🪐\n\nRow3: 🐚\n\nRow4: ✨\n\nRow5: 🦗\n\nRow6: ✨\n\nRow7: 🦟\n\nRow8: 🍃\n\nRow9: 🌺\n\nRow10: 🦟\n\nSequence: 🌺, 🪐, 🐚, ✨, 🦗, ✨, 🦟, 🍃, 🌺, 🦟.\n\nNo consecutive same here. So column2 contributes 0.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow1: 🌚\n\nRow2: 🌊\n\nRow3: 🌊\n\nRow4: 🪐\n\nRow5: 🐚\n\nRow6: 🦟\n\nRow7: 🦟\n\nRow8: 🦟\n\nRow9: 🌹\n\nRow10: 🦟\n\nSequence: 🌚, 🌊, 🌊, 🪐, 🐚, 🦟, 🦟, 🦟, 🌹, 🦟.\n\nCheck runs:\n\nPositions2-3 (row2-3): 🌊🌊 → run of 2 → add 1.\n\nPositions6-8 (row6-8): 🦟🦟🦟 → run of 3 → add 1.\n\nThen row10's 🦟 is after 🌹, so no.\n\nSo column3 has two vertical runs: 🌊🌊 and 🦟🦟🦟. So contributes 2.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow1: 🪐\n\nRow2: 🌺\n\nRow3: 🍃\n\nRow4: 🍃\n\nRow5: 🌹\n\nRow6: 🌚\n\nRow7: 🌚\n\nRow8: 🌚\n\nRow9: 🐚\n\nRow10: 🐚\n\nSequence: 🪐, 🌺, 🍃, 🍃, 🌹, 🌚, 🌚, 🌚, 🐚, 🐚.\n\nCheck runs:\n\nRow3-4: 🍃🍃 → run of 2 → add 1.\n\nRow6-8: 🌚🌚🌚 → run of 3 → add 1.\n\nRow9-10: 🐚🐚 → run of 2 → add 1.\n\nSo column4 has three runs. So contributes 3.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow1: ✨\n\nRow2: 🌊\n\nRow3: 🪐\n\nRow4: 🌚\n\nRow5: ✨\n\nRow6: 🍃\n\nRow7: 🌊\n\nRow8: 🌺\n\nRow9: 🪐\n\nRow10: 🍃\n\nSequence: ✨, 🌊, 🪐, 🌚, ✨, 🍃, 🌊, 🌺, 🪐, 🍃.\n\nNo consecutive same. So column5 contributes 0.\n\nColumn6:\n\nRow1: 🌺\n\nRow2: 🍃\n\nRow3: 🦗\n\nRow4: 🪐\n\nRow5: 🍃\n\nRow6: 🍃\n\nRow7: 🐚\n\nRow8: 🐚\n\nRow9: 🌹\n\nRow10: ✨\n\nSequence: 🌺, 🍃, 🦗, 🪐, 🍃, 🍃, 🐚, 🐚, 🌹, ✨.\n\nCheck runs:\n\nRow5-6 (positions5-6): 🍃🍃 → run of 2 → add 1.\n\nRow7-8: 🐚🐚 → run of 2 → add 1.\n\nSo column6 contributes 2.\n\nColumn7:\n\nRow1: 🌚\n\nRow2: 🌹\n\nRow3: 🪐\n\nRow4: ✨\n\nRow5: 🌚\n\nRow6: 🐚\n\nRow7: ✨\n\nRow8: 🌚\n\nRow9: 🐚\n\nRow10: 🌊\n\nSequence: 🌚, 🌹, 🪐, ✨, 🌚, 🐚, ✨, 🌚, 🐚, 🌊.\n\nNo consecutive same. So column7 contributes 0.\n\nColumn8:\n\nRow1: 🌹\n\nRow2: 🌚\n\nRow3: 🌊\n\nRow4: 🦟\n\nRow5: 🌊\n\nRow6: 🍃\n\nRow7: 🦗\n\nRow8: 🍃\n\nRow9: 🌺\n\nRow10: ✨\n\nSequence: 🌹, 🌚, 🌊, 🦟, 🌊, 🍃, 🦗, 🍃, 🌺, ✨.\n\nNo runs. So column8 contributes 0.\n\nColumn9:\n\nRow1: 🍃\n\nRow2: 🍃\n\nRow3: 🐚\n\nRow4: 🌹\n\nRow5: 🌚\n\nRow6: 🪐\n\nRow7: 🌚\n\nRow8: 🍃\n\nRow9: 🦟\n\nRow10: 🍃\n\nSequence: 🍃, 🍃, 🐚, 🌹, 🌚, 🪐, 🌚, 🍃, 🦟, 🍃.\n\nCheck runs:\n\nRow1-2: 🍃🍃 → run of 2 → add 1.\n\nSo column9 contributes 1.\n\nColumn10:\n\nRow1: 🌊\n\nRow2: 🍃\n\nRow3: 🌹\n\nRow4: 🌚\n\nRow5: 🦟\n\nRow6: 🪐\n\nRow7: ✨\n\nRow8: 🪐\n\nRow9: 🦟\n\nRow10: 🐚\n\nSequence: 🌊, 🍃, 🌹, 🌚, 🦟, 🪐, ✨, 🪐, 🦟, 🐚.\n\nNo consecutive same. So column10 contributes 0.\n\nNow sum all vertical line counts:\n\nColumn1:1\n\nColumn2:0\n\nColumn3:2\n\nColumn4:3\n\nColumn5:0\n\nColumn6:2\n\nColumn7:0\n\nColumn8:0\n\nColumn9:1\n\nColumn10:0\n\nTotal vertical: 1+0+2+3+0+2+0+0+1+0 = 9?\n\n1+0=1 → +2=3 → +3=6 → +0=6 → +2=8 → +0=8 → +0=8 → +1=9. Yes, 9 vertical lines.\n\nSo total lines (horizontal + vertical) is 8 +9=17?\n\nWait, but wait. Let me recheck the counts.\n\nHorizontal lines sum: 0+1+1+0+0+2+1+1+1+1 = let's compute again:\n\nRows:\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:1 → total 1\n\nRow3:1 → total 2\n\nRow4:0 → 2\n\nRow5:0 → 2\n\nRow6:2 → 4\n\nRow7:1 →5\n\nRow8:1 →6\n\nRow9:1 →7\n\nRow10:1 →8. Correct.\n\nVertical lines: column counts sum to 1+0+2+3+0+2+0+0+1+0= 1+2=3, +3=6, +2=8, +1=9. So yes, 9.\n\nTotal lines: 8+9=17.\n\nBut wait, did I make any mistake in the counts?\n\nLet me recheck some columns.\n\nColumn3: sequence is 🌚, 🌊, 🌊, 🪐, 🐚, 🦟, 🦟, 🦟, 🌹, 🦟.\n\nRuns: \n\nRow2 and 3 (🌊🌊) → 2 → 1.\n\nRows6-8 (🦟🦟🦟) → 3 → 1. So total 2? No, no. Because each run counts once regardless of length. So column3 contributes 2 runs (each run is a line of >=2). So yes, 2.\n\nColumn4: three runs (row3-4, row6-8, row9-10). So 3.\n\nColumn6: two runs (row5-6 and 7-8) → 2.\n\nColumn9: run in row1-2 → 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo vertical lines sum to 9.\n\nSo total answer is 8+9=17.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me recheck some of the rows and columns again to ensure.\n\nLet me check Row7 again.\n\nRow7: 🦟🦟🦟🌚🌊🐚✨🦗🌚✨\n\nThe first three are 🦟🦟🦟 → run of 3 → counts as one.

Hmm, the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more on this board. Oh right, and each such line contributes to the count. But wait, how exactly are lines considered here? Like, if there's a longer line, does each possible segment count as a separate line? Or do we count each consecutive same emoji as a line of their length, but considering overlapping lines?\n\nWait, the problem statement says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So for example, a horizontal line of 3 same emojis in a row would count as how many? Let's see. Like, if a row has three in a row, that's a single line of length 3. But the problem says to count the total lines of length 2 or more. So each such run contributes 1 to the total count. So for a run of 4 same emojis horizontally, that's one line. Because it's a continuous line. Similarly for vertical.\n\nSo the approach is: check each horizontal run in each row, each vertical run in each column. For each row, scan from left to right, group consecutive same emojis. For each group, if the length is >=2, add 1 to the count. Do the same for each column, checking vertical runs.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, the problem statement says \"horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So each horizontal line (row) and each vertical line (column) that has consecutive same emojis of length >=2 counts as one. So for example, in a row like 🐕🐕🐕, that's one horizontal line. If there's a row like 🐕🐕🌹🌹, then that's two horizontal lines. Similarly for columns.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each row in the board:\n   a. Traverse each cell, checking consecutive emojis. Whenever a group of the same emoji is found with length >=2, increment the count by 1 per such group.\n\n2. For each column in the board:\n   a. Do the same as rows, but vertically. Check consecutive emojis in the column. For each group of same emojis with length >=2, add 1 to the count.\n\nSo the total count is the sum of all horizontal runs (groups in rows) and vertical runs (groups in columns) that meet the length condition.\n\nNow, let's look at the given board. It's a 10x10 grid (assuming each of the 10 lines provided is a row, and each row has 10 emojis). So 10 rows and 10 columns.\n\nWe need to process each row and column, find consecutive runs of same emoji, count each run of 2+ as one.\n\nLet's start by processing each row.\n\nLet me write down the rows as given. Let's number them from 0 to 9 (assuming first is row 0, but maybe it's easier to index from 0 for code purposes).\n\nRow 0: 🦚🐆🐕🌷🌹🐆🌕🦚🦢🌕\nRow 1: 🦢🐕🌹🐆🐕🐊🌷🦢😄🐊\nRow 2: 🌹🌹🌷🐕🐊😄🦚🐊😄🌕\nRow 3: 🌷🦢🐆🌷🌕🌹🌷🌕🌷🐊\nRow 4: 😄🐆😄🐆🦚🦚🐆😄🌷🌹\nRow 5: 🐊🐕🦇🦢🦢😄🦇🐊🦇🐕\nRow 6: 🦢🦢🦢🌷🐆🌷🌕🌹😄😄\nRow 7: 🌹🌷🌹🐕😄🌹😄🐕🐆🐊\nRow 8: 🌷🐕🌕🐊🦇🌹😄🦇🦚🦢\nRow 9: 🐆🌹🌷🦚🦢🐕🦢🦇🦚🦚\n\nNow, for each row, let's check the horizontal runs.\n\nRow 0: Let's see the emojis:\n\n0: 🦚\n1: 🐆\n2: 🐕\n3: 🌷\n4: 🌹\n5: 🐆\n6: 🌕\n7: 🦚\n8: 🦢\n9: 🌕\n\nCheck consecutive duplicates. Each time the current emoji is same as previous, track the start and end. For example, here, no consecutive duplicates in this row. So no horizontal lines here. So row 0 contributes 0.\n\nRow 1:\n\n0: 🦢\n1: 🐕\n2: 🌹\n3: 🐆\n4: 🐕\n5: 🐊\n6: 🌷\n7: 🦢\n8: 😄\n9: 🐊\n\nAgain, no consecutive duplicates. So no horizontal lines here. So row 1 contributes 0.\n\nRow 2:\n\n0: 🌹\n1: 🌹\n2: 🌷\n3: 🐕\n4: 🐊\n5: 😄\n6: 🦚\n7: 🐊\n8: 😄\n9: 🌕\n\nAt positions 0-1: two 🌹. So that's a horizontal run of 2. So count +=1.\n\nThen, the rest are single. So row 2 contributes 1.\n\nRow 3:\n\n0: 🌷\n1: 🦢\n2: 🐆\n3: 🌷\n4: 🌕\n5: 🌹\n6: 🌷\n7: 🌕\n8: 🌷\n9: 🐊\n\nAll emojis are single, no consecutive. So row 3 contributes 0.\n\nRow 4:\n\n0: 😄\n1: 🐆\n2: 😄\n3: 🐆\n4: 🦚\n5: 🦚\n6: 🐆\n7: 😄\n8: 🌷\n9: 🌹\n\nLooking for consecutive same. Let's see:\n\nPositions 4-5: 🦚🦚 → run of 2. So count +=1.\n\nOther positions: 0,1: 😄🐆 → no. 1-2: 🐆😄 → no. 2-3: 😄🐆 → no. 3-4: 🐆🦚 → no. 5-6: 🦚🐆 → no. 6-7: 🐆😄 → no. 7-8: 😄🌷 → no. 8-9: 🌷🌹 → no.\n\nSo row 4 contributes 1.\n\nRow 5:\n\n0: 🐊\n1: 🐕\n2: 🦇\n3: 🦢\n4: 🦢\n5: 😄\n6: 🦇\n7: 🐊\n8: 🦇\n9: 🐕\n\nCheck for runs. Positions 3-4: 🦢🦢 → run of 2. So count +=1.\n\nOther positions: no other consecutive. So row 5 contributes 1.\n\nRow 6:\n\n0: 🦢\n1: 🦢\n2: 🦢\n3: 🌷\n4: 🐆\n5: 🌷\n6: 🌕\n7: 🌹\n8: 😄\n9: 😄\n\nThe first three are 🦢🦢🦢 → a run of 3. So this counts as 1 horizontal line. Then, positions 8-9: 😄😄 → another run of 2. So total 2 for row 6.\n\nRow 7:\n\n0: 🌹\n1: 🌷\n2: 🌹\n3: 🐕\n4: 😄\n5: 🌹\n6: 😄\n7: 🐕\n8: 🐆\n9: 🐊\n\nNo consecutive duplicates. So 0 contributions.\n\nRow 8:\n\n0: 🌷\n1: 🐕\n2: 🌕\n3: 🐊\n4: 🦇\n5: 🌹\n6: 😄\n7: 🦇\n8: 🦚\n9: 🦢\n\nNo consecutive duplicates. So 0.\n\nRow 9:\n\n0: 🐆\n1: 🌹\n2: 🌷\n3: 🦚\n4: 🦢\n5: 🐕\n6: 🦢\n7: 🦇\n8: 🦚\n9: 🦚\n\nCheck here. Positions 8-9: 🦚🦚 → run of 2. So count +=1 for row 9.\n\nNow summing up the horizontal lines: row 2 (1) + row4 (1) + row5 (1) + row6 (2) + row9 (1) → total 1+1+1+2+1=6 horizontal lines.\n\nNow, process the columns for vertical runs. Each column is 10 cells tall. So for each column, check consecutive same emojis in vertical direction (i.e., down the rows).\n\nLet's go through each column, from column 0 to 9.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow 0: 🦚\nRow 1: 🦢\nRow 2: 🌹\nRow 3: 🌷\nRow 4: 😄\nRow 5: 🐊\nRow 6: 🦢\nRow 7: 🌹\nRow 8: 🌷\nRow 9: 🐆\n\nCheck consecutive same in this column. Let's list the emojis:\n\n0: 🦚\n1: 🦢\n2: 🌹\n3: 🌷\n4: 😄\n5: 🐊\n6: 🦢\n7: 🌹\n8: 🌷\n9: 🐆\n\nNo consecutive duplicates here. So column 0 contributes 0.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow 0: 🐆\nRow 1: 🐕\nRow 2: 🌹\nRow 3: 🦢\nRow 4: 🐆\nRow 5: 🐕\nRow 6: 🦢\nRow 7: 🌷\nRow 8: 🐕\nRow 9: 🌹\n\nEmojis:\n\n0: 🐆\n1: 🐕\n2: 🌹\n3: 🦢\n4: 🐆\n5: 🐕\n6: 🦢\n7: 🌷\n8: 🐕\n9: 🌹\n\nNo consecutive duplicates. So column 1: 0.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow0: 🐕\nRow1: 🌹\nRow2: 🌷\nRow3: 🐆\nRow4: 😄\nRow5: 🦇\nRow6: 🦢\nRow7: 🌹\nRow8: 🌕\nRow9: 🌷\n\nCheck:\n\n0: 🐕\n1: 🌹\n2: 🌷\n3: 🐆\n4: 😄\n5: 🦇\n6: 🦢\n7: 🌹\n8: 🌕\n9: 🌷\n\nNo consecutive. Column 2: 0.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🌷\nRow1: 🐆\nRow2: 🐕\nRow3: 🌷\nRow4: 🐆\nRow5: 🦢\nRow6: 🌷\nRow7: 🌹\nRow8: 🐊\nRow9: 🦚\n\nEmojis:\n\n0: 🌷\n1: 🐆\n2: 🐕\n3: 🌷\n4: 🐆\n5: 🦢\n6: 🌷\n7: 🌹\n8: 🐊\n9: 🦚\n\nNo consecutive same.

So in column5, rows 7 and 8: same?\n\nWait, column5:\n\nRow0: column5 is 🐆 (row0's index5 is 🐆)\nRow1: index5 is 🐊?\nWait, the rows are:\n\nWait, each row has 10 elements.\n\nWait, let me recheck. For row0: the elements are:\n\n0: 🦚, 1: 🐆, 2: 🐕, 3: 🌷, 4: 🌹, 5: 🐆, 6: 🌕, 7: 🦚, 8: 🦢, 9: 🌕.\n\nSo column5 is row0's index5, which is 🐆 (row0,5: 🐆).\n\nRow1's index5 is 🐊 (row1: elements are 🦢, 🐕, 🌹, 🐆, 🐕, 🐊, 🌷, 🦢, 😄, 🐊. So index5 is 🐊.\n\nRow2's index5 is 😄 (row2: 🌹🌹🌷🐕🐊😄🦚🐊😄🌕 → index5 is 😄.\n\nRow3's index5: row3 is 🌷🦢🐆🌷🌕🌹🌷🌕🌷🐊 → index5 is 🌹.\n\nRow4's index5: row4 is 😄🐆😄🐆🦚🦚🐆😄🌷🌹 → index5 is 🦚.\n\nRow5's index5: row5's elements are 🐊🐕🦇🦢🦢😄🦇🐊🦇🐕 → index5 is 😄.\n\nRow6's index5: row6: 🦢🦢🦢🌷🐆🌷🌕🌹😄😄 → index5 is 🌷.\n\nRow7's index5: row7: 🌹🌷🌹🐕😄🌹😄🐕🐆🐊 → index5 is 🌹.\n\nRow8's index5: row8: 🌷🐕🌕🐊🦇🌹😄🦇🦚🦢 → index5 is 🌹.\n\nRow9's index5: row9: 🐆🌹🌷🦚🦢🐕🦢🦇🦚🦚 → index5 is 🐕.\n\nSo column5's emojis from row0 to row9 are:\n\n0: 🐆\n1: 🐊\n2: 😄\n3: 🌹\n4: 🦚\n5: 😄\n6: 🌷\n7: 🌹\n8: 🌹\n9: 🐕\n\nLooking for consecutive duplicates:\n\nRow7: 🌹, row8: 🌹 → rows7 and8 in column5 are 🌹 and 🌹 → a run of 2. So this is a vertical line. So column5 contributes 1.\n\nOther parts: rows0-1: 🐆, 🐊 → no. row2-3: 😄, 🌹 → no. rows5-6: 😄, 🌷 → no. rows8-9: 🌹, 🐕 → no.\n\nSo column5 has 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn6:\n\nCheck each row's 6th index.\n\nRow0:6 → 🌕\n\nRow1:6 → 🌷\n\nRow2:6 → 🦚\n\nRow3:6 → 🌷\n\nRow4:6 → 🐆\n\nRow5:6 → 🦇\n\nRow6:6 → 🌕\n\nRow7:6 → 😄\n\nRow8:6 → 😄\n\nRow9:6 → 🦢\n\nSo column6's emojis:\n\n0: 🌕\n1: 🌷\n2: 🦚\n3: 🌷\n4: 🐆\n5: 🦇\n6: 🌕\n7: 😄\n8: 😄\n9: 🦢\n\nCheck for consecutive. Rows7 and8: 😄 and 😄 → run of 2. So this contributes 1. So column6:1.\n\nOther parts: row6's 🌕 and row7's 😄 are different. So vertical line count here is 1.\n\nColumn7:\n\nCheck index7 of each row.\n\nRow0:7 → 🦚\n\nRow1:7 → 🦢\n\nRow2:7 → 🐊\n\nRow3:7 → 🌕\n\nRow4:7 → 😄\n\nRow5:7 → 🐊\n\nRow6:7 → 🌹\n\nRow7:7 → 🐕\n\nRow8:7 → 🦇\n\nRow9:7 → 🦇\n\nSo column7's emojis:\n\n0: 🦚\n\n1: 🦢\n\n2: 🐊\n\n3: 🌕\n\n4: 😄\n\n5: 🐊\n\n6: 🌹\n\n7: 🐕\n\n8: 🦇\n\n9: 🦇\n\nCheck consecutive. Rows8-9: 🦇 and 🦇 → run of 2. So column7 contributes 1.\n\nOther parts: no. So column7:1.\n\nColumn8:\n\nCheck index8 of each row.\n\nRow0:8 → 🦢\n\nRow1:8 → 😄\n\nRow2:8 → 😄\n\nRow3:8 → 🌷\n\nRow4:8 → 🌷\n\nRow5:8 → 🦇\n\nRow6:8 → 😄\n\nRow7:8 → 🐆\n\nRow8:8 → 🦚\n\nRow9:8 → 🦚\n\nSo column8's emojis:\n\n0: 🦢\n\n1: 😄\n\n2: 😄\n\n3: 🌷\n\n4: 🌷\n\n5: 🦇\n\n6: 😄\n\n7: 🐆\n\n8: 🦚\n\n9: 🦚\n\nLooking for consecutive same:\n\nRow0-1: 🦢 vs 😄 → no.\n\nRow1-2: 😄 vs 😄 → run of 2. So that's a vertical line. Then row2-3: 😄 vs 🌷 → no.\n\nRow3-4: 🌷 vs 🌷 → another run of 2. So another vertical line.\n\nRow4-5: 🌷 vs 🦇 → no.\n\nRow6-7: 😄 vs 🐆 → no.\n\nRow8-9: 🦚 vs 🦚 → run of 2. So three vertical lines in column8.\n\nSo column8 contributes 3.\n\nWait, let's break it down step by step:\n\nCheck from top to bottom:\n\nStart at row0: 🦢.\n\nrow1: 😄. Different. So no run here.\n\nrow2: 😄. Same as row1 (row2 is index8: 😄). So from row1 to row2, a run of 2. So that's one line.\n\nThen row3: 🌷. Different. So that run ends. Next, row3 and row4: both 🌷 → run of 2. So another line.\n\nRow5: 🦇. Different. Then row6: 😄. Different. Row7: 🐆. Different. Row8 and row9: 🦚🦚 → run of 2. So third line.\n\nSo column8 has three vertical lines. So column8 contributes 3.\n\nColumn9:\n\nCheck index9 of each row.\n\nRow0:9 → 🌕\n\nRow1:9 → 🐊\n\nRow2:9 → 🌕\n\nRow3:9 → 🐊\n\nRow4:9 → 🌹\n\nRow5:9 → 🐕\n\nRow6:9 → 😄\n\nRow7:9 → 🐊\n\nRow8:9 → 🦢\n\nRow9:9 → 🦚\n\nEmojis:\n\n0: 🌕\n\n1: 🐊\n\n2: 🌕\n\n3: 🐊\n\n4: 🌹\n\n5: 🐕\n\n6: 😄\n\n7: 🐊\n\n8: 🦢\n\n9: 🦚\n\nNo consecutive duplicates. So column9 contributes 0.\n\nNow summing the vertical lines:\n\ncolumn5: 1\n\ncolumn6:1\n\ncolumn7:1\n\ncolumn8:3\n\nOthers:0.\n\nTotal vertical lines: 1+1+1+3=6.\n\nSo horizontal lines sum to 6, vertical lines sum to 6. Total answer is 6+6=12?\n\nWait, but wait, let's recheck all the columns.\n\nWait, column8 had three vertical lines. Let's recount each column.\n\nColumns 0-9:\n\nAfter processing:\n\n- Column5: 1\n\n- Column6:1\n\n- Column7:1\n\n- Column8:3\n\nOthers:0.\n\nSo vertical total is 1+1+1+3 =6.\n\nHorizontal:6.\n\nTotal 12. But let's make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the columns.\n\nWait, column6's emojis are:\n\nRow6:6 → 🌕 (row6 is 🦢🦢🦢🌷🐆🌷🌕🌹😄😄 → index6 is 🌕.\n\nRow7:6 → 😄 (row7: 🌹🌷🌹🐕😄🌹😄🐕🐆🐊 → index6 is 😄.\n\nRow8:6 → 😄 (row8: 🌷🐕🌕🐊🦇🌹😄🦇🦚🦢 → index6 is 😄.\n\nSo column6's rows6,7,8: 🌕, 😄, 😄.\n\nWait, row6's index6 is 🌕, row7's index6 is 😄, row8's index6 is 😄.\n\nSo in column6, the emojis are:\n\nrow0:6 → 🌕\n\nrow1:6 → 🌷\n\nrow2:6 → 🦚\n\nrow3:6 → 🌷\n\nrow4:6 → 🐆\n\nrow5:6 → 🦇\n\nrow6:6 → 🌕\n\nrow7:6 → 😄\n\nrow8:6 → 😄\n\nrow9:6 → 🦢\n\nSo rows7 and8 in column6: 😄 and 😄 → that's two consecutive, so a vertical line of 2. So column6 contributes 1.\n\nYes.\n\ncolumn8:\n\nrows0-1-2: 🦢, 😄, 😄. So rows1 and2: 😄😄 → vertical line.\n\nrows3-4: 🌷 and 🌷 → vertical line.\n\nrows8-9: 🦚🦚 → vertical line.\n\nSo three vertical lines. Correct.\n\ncolumn7:\n\nrows8-9: 🦇🦇 → vertical line. Correct.\n\nSo vertical sum is 1 (col5) +1 (col6) +1 (col7) +3 (col8) =6.\n\nSo horizontal is 6, vertical 6 → total 12.\n\nBut wait, I thought the example given in the problem statement would have a different answer. But according to this calculation, the answer is 12. Let me cross-check.\n\nLet me re-examine the rows for horizontal runs again.\n\nRow6: 🦢🦢🦢🌷🐆🌷🌕🌹😄😄 → three 🦢 in a row. So that's one run. Then, two 😄 at the end. So two runs. So row6 contributes 2. Correct.\n\nRow9: 🐆🌹🌷🦚🦢🐕🦢🦇🦚🦚 → last two are 🦚. So one run. Correct.\n\nRow4: positions 4 and5: 🦚🦚. Correct. So 1.\n\nRow5: positions3-4: 🦢🦢. Correct. So 1.\n\nRow2: first two 🌹. Correct. So 1.\n\nSo horizontal sum is 1 (row2) +1 (row4) +1 (row5) +2 (row6) +1 (row9) → total 6.\n\nVertical sum is 6. So total is 12.\n\nBut wait, could there be any mistake here? For example, in column8, there are three vertical lines. Let's see:\n\nRow1-2: 😄😄. So from row1 to row2 in column8 (index8). Wait, column8's index is 8. Let me check each row's index8.\n\nRow0: index8 is 🦢.\n\nRow1: index8 is 😄.\n\nRow2: index8 is 😄.\n\nRow3: index8 is 🌷.\n\nRow4: index8 is 🌷.\n\nRow5: index8 is 🦇.\n\nRow6: index8 is 😄.\n\nRow7: index8 is 🐆.\n\nRow8: index8 is 🦚.\n\nRow9: index8 is 🦚.\n\nSo column8 is:\n\n0: 🦢\n\n1: 😄\n\n2: 😄\n\n3: 🌷\n\n4: 🌷\n\n5: 🦇\n\n6: 😄\n\n7: 🐆\n\n8: 🦚\n\n9: 🦚\n\nSo consecutive runs:\n\nrow1-2: 😄 (row1) and 😄 (row2) → run of 2.\n\nrow3-4: 🌷 (row3) and 🌷 (row4) → run of 2.\n\nrow8-9: 🦚 (row8) and 🦚 (row9) → run of 2.\n\nSo three separate runs, each of length 2. So each contributes 1. So column8: 3.\n\nYes. Correct.\n\nSo the total vertical lines are 3 (column8) + 1 (col5) +1 (col6) +1 (col7) → 6.\n\nSo overall, the answer is 6 (horizontal) +6 (vertical) =12.\n\n\nAnswer: 12"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

So, the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more on the given board. Hmm, right. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the board. It looks like a 7x7 grid based on the input provided. Each cell is an emoji. For each row and column, I need to check sequences of the same emoji. But wait, lines longer than 2 should be counted as a single line. For example, a sequence of 3 same emojis in a row would count as one line, not two (since 2+1 doesn't add two lines). Wait, no, the problem says \"length of 2 or more\". So any consecutive line (horizontal or vertical) of two or more same emojis counts as one line. So even a sequence of 4 same emojis in a row would count as one line. But wait, maybe I should check each possible line. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The question says \"the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So each line (horizontal or vertical) that has at least two same emojis in a straight line. But for overlapping sequences, how are they counted? For example, a row like 🦆🦆🦆 would have two possible horizontal lines of length 2 (positions 1-2 and 2-3). But according to some interpretations, the entire row counts as one line of length 3, which is valid. So in this case, the entire row would contribute one line. Wait, but the problem might be considering each maximal consecutive line. So a sequence of three same emojis in a row is a single line of length 3. So each such maximal consecutive sequence of length 2 or more counts as one line. That's probably the right approach. So the problem is to count each maximal consecutive sequence (horizontal or vertical) of length >=2. So for a horizontal row, each run of same emojis that's 2 or longer counts as one. Similarly for vertical columns. So the steps are: for each row, check each horizontal run, count each if length >=2. Then for each column, check each vertical run, count each if length >=2. Then sum both.\n\nSo let's process the board given. Let's first look at the rows.\n\nLooking at the board rows:\n\nRow 0: 🐋🐺🦆🦏🦑🦟🐋\nLet's see the sequence. Each emoji is different from the previous one. So no horizontal lines here. So 0.\n\nRow 1: 🦞🦏🦆🦑🐺🐋🦟\nAgain, all different. So 0.\n\nRow 2: 🦆🦏🐋🦆🦆🦆🦆\nHere, from position 3 to 6 (0-based?), let's index from 0. Positions 3 to 6 are 🦆 four times. Let's see: the row is:\n\n0: 🦆\n1: 🦏\n2: 🐋\n3: 🦆\n4: 🦆\n5: 🦆\n6: 🦆\n\nSo positions 3-6: all 🦆. So a run of 4. That's one horizontal line. So row 2 contributes 1.\n\nRow 3: 🦟🦆🦞🦑🦞🦏🦆\nCheck each consecutive. Looking:\n\n0: 🦟, 1: 🦆 (different). 1: 🦆, 2: 🦞 (different). So no runs here. So 0.\n\nRow 4: 🦟🦟🦆🦏🦞🦆🐺\nFirst two emojis are 🦟. So a run of 2. So that's one. The rest: 🦆, 🦏, 🦞, 🦆, 🐺. No other runs. So row 4 contributes 1.\n\nRow 5: 🐺🦞🦑🦟🦞🦑🦟\nCheck each. All consecutive are different. So 0.\n\nRow 6: 🦑🐋🦟🦆🐺🦆🦑\nAll consecutive are different. So 0.\n\nSo total horizontal lines: row 2 (1) + row 4 (1) = 2.\n\nNow check vertical lines. Each column has 7 rows (since the board is 7x7). Let's go through each column from 0 to 6.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow 0: 🐋\n\nRow 1: 🦞\n\nRow 2: 🦆\n\nRow 3: 🦟\n\nRow 4: 🦟\n\nRow 5: 🐺\n\nRow 6: 🦑\n\nCheck vertical runs. Starting from row 0:\n\nRow 0: 🐋, row 1: 🦞 (different). Then row 3: 🦟, row 4: 🦟 (same). So from row3 to row4: a run of 2. Then row5 is 🐺 (different). So column 0 has one vertical run (rows 3-4: 🦟🦟). So 1.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow0: 🐺\n\nRow1: 🦏\n\nRow2: 🦏\n\nRow3: 🦆\n\nRow4: 🦟\n\nRow5: 🦞\n\nRow6: 🐋\n\nLooking for vertical runs. Check consecutive:\n\nRow0 (🐺) and row1 (🦏) different. Row1 (🦏) and row2 (🦏) same. So from row1 to row2: run of 2. Then row2 (🦏) vs row3 (🦆) different. So column 1 has 1 vertical run.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow0: 🦆\n\nRow1: 🦆\n\nRow2: 🐋\n\nRow3: 🦞\n\nRow4: 🦆\n\nRow5: 🦑\n\nRow6: 🦟\n\nCheck for vertical runs.\n\nRow0: 🦆 and row1: 🦆 same. So run of 2 (rows0-1). That's one. Then row1 and row2: different. Then row4 and row5 etc. So column2 contributes 1.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🦏\n\nRow1: 🦑\n\nRow2: 🦆\n\nRow3: 🦑\n\nRow4: 🦏\n\nRow5: 🦟\n\nRow6: 🦆\n\nCheck runs:\n\nRow0: 🦏, row1: 🦑 different. Row1: 🦑, row2: 🦆 different. No runs. So column3 has 0.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow0: 🦑\n\nRow1: 🐺\n\nRow2: 🦆\n\nRow3: 🦞\n\nRow4: 🦞\n\nRow5: 🦞\n\nRow6: 🐺\n\nLooking for consecutive runs.\n\nRow3: 🦞, row4: 🦞 (same). Then row4: 🦞, row5: 🦞 (same). So the runs here are rows3-4-5: three same. That's a single vertical run of length 3. So column4 has 1.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow0: 🦟\n\nRow1: 🐋\n\nRow2: 🦆\n\nRow3: 🦏\n\nRow4: 🦆\n\nRow5: 🦑\n\nRow6: 🦆\n\nCheck vertical runs. All consecutive pairs are different. So 0.\n\nColumn6:\n\nRow0: 🐋\n\nRow1: 🦟\n\nRow2: 🦆\n\nRow3: 🦆\n\nRow4: 🐺\n\nRow5: 🦟\n\nRow6: 🦑\n\nCheck vertical runs:\n\nRow3: 🦆 and row4: 🐺 (different). Any runs here? Let's check each pair.\n\nRow0: 🐋, row1: 🦟 (diff). Row1: 🦟, row2: 🦆 (diff). Row2: 🦆, row3: 🦆 (same). So rows2-3: run of 2. That's one. Then row3-4: diff. So column6 contributes 1.\n\nSo vertical runs:\n\nColumns 0: 1, 1:1, 2:1, 4:1, 6:1. Wait, columns 0,1,2,4,6 each have 1. So 5 vertical lines.\n\nWait column 6's run is rows 2 and 3 (🦆 and 🦆), which is a vertical run of 2. So yes.\n\nSo vertical total is 5.\n\nWait, let's recount each column:\n\nColumn0:\n\nrows3 and 4 (🦟🦟) → 1.\n\nColumn1:\n\nrows1 and 2 (🦏🦏) →1.\n\nColumn2:\n\nrows0 and1 (🦆🦆) →1.\n\nColumn3: no runs.\n\nColumn4:\n\nrows3,4,5 (🦞🦞🦞) →1.\n\nColumn5: no.\n\nColumn6:\n\nrows2 and3 (🦆🦆) →1.\n\nSo columns 0,1,2,4,6 have runs. So 5 vertical lines.\n\nSo total vertical is 5.\n\nSo horizontal lines are 2, vertical lines are 5. Total answer is 2 +5 =7?\n\nWait, let's check again.\n\nWait, for column 4:\n\nrows3: 🦞, row4: 🦞, row5: 🦞. So that's a vertical run of 3. So that counts as 1. So yes.\n\nThen for vertical lines, 5.\n\nSo total answer would be 2+5=7?\n\nBut let me double-check each row and column again to make sure I didn't miss any.\n\nHorizontal:\n\nRow0: no.\n\nRow1: no.\n\nRow2: 🦆 starting at position3, four in a row (positions3-6). So 1.\n\nRow3: no. All consecutive are different.\n\nRow4: positions0-1: 🦟🦟 →1.\n\nRow5: no.\n\nRow6: no.\n\nTotal horizontal: yes, 2.\n\nVertical columns:\n\nColumn0: rows3-4 (🦟🦟 →1.\n\nColumn1: rows1-2 (🦏→ same, so run of 2. →1.\n\nColumn2: rows0-1 (🦆 and 🦆 → run of 2. →1.\n\nColumn3: no runs.\n\nColumn4: rows3-4-5 (🦞 three in a row →1.\n\nColumn5: no.\n\nColumn6: rows2-3 (🦆🦆 →1.\n\nSo 1+1+1+1+1=5.\n\nYes. So total lines are 2+5=7.\n\nSo the answer should be 7. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, looking again at row2. Let's re-express the row:\n\nRow2: 🦆🦏🐋🦆🦆🦆🦆. So positions:\n\n0: 🦆, 1: 🦏, 2: 🐋, 3: 🦆, 4: 🦆, 5: 🦆,6: 🦆.\n\nSo the sequence from position3 to6 is 4 emojis of 🦆. So the run starts at 3 and continues to 6. So that's a run of 4, which counts as one horizontal line.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother check for row4:\n\nRow4: 🦟🦟🦆🦏🦞🦆🐺. So positions0 and1 are 🦟. So that's a run of 2. So counts as one.\n\nIn column4:\n\nrows3,4,5: 🦞, 🦞, 🦞. So three in a row. Counts as one vertical line.\n\nColumn6: rows2 and3 are 🦆 and 🦆. So two in a row. Counts as one.\n\nSo vertical is 5.\n\nHmm. So 2 horizontal, 5 vertical. Total 7.\n\nSo the answer should be 7. But let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I missed some other lines.\n\nWait, looking at column2 again:\n\nrows are:\n\nRow0: 🦆\n\nRow1: 🦆 (same as row0 → run of 2 → counted as 1.\n\nThen row2: 🐋 (different). So yes.\n\nSo that's one.\n\nWhat about column5:\n\nLooking at rows:\n\nRow0: 🦟\n\nRow1: 🐋\n\nRow2: 🦆\n\nRow3: 🦏\n\nRow4: 🦆\n\nRow5: 🦑\n\nRow6: 🦆\n\nNo consecutive same in column5.\n\nAnother possible mistake: let's check column6 again.\n\nColumn6:\n\nRow0: 🐋\n\nRow1: 🦟\n\nRow2: 🦆\n\nRow3: 🦆\n\nRow4: 🐺\n\nRow5: 🦟\n\nRow6: 🦑\n\nRows2 and3: 🦆 and 🦆 → same. So a run of 2. So counted as 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo total vertical lines are 5.\n\nSo adding 2+5=7. Answer is 7. Let me make sure no other lines were missed.\n\nWait, in row3: 🦟, 🦆, 🦞, 🦑, 🦞, 🦏, 🦆. No runs.\n\nRow5: all different.\n\nRow6: all different.\n\nHorizontal lines are correct.\n\nVertical columns:\n\nLet me check column2 again. The first two rows are 🦆, then row1 is 🦆 (same as row0). So run of two. So yes.\n\nIn column4:\n\nrows3: 🦞, row4: 🦞 (same), row5: 🦞 (same). So three in a row. So one vertical line.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the total is 7.\n\n\nAnswer: 7"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The lines have to be of length 2 or more. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the board is given as a grid of emojis. Let me visualize it. The input has 6 rows, each with 6 emojis. So it's a 6x6 grid. Each line (horizontal or vertical) must be consecutive same emojis. But I need to count each possible line of length 2 or more. However, I have to be careful not to double count overlapping lines. Wait, but the problem says to count each line. Wait, for example, a horizontal line of 3 same emojis would count as two lines of length 2 (the first two and the last two) plus the whole 3 as a line of length 3. Or maybe the problem considers a line as any consecutive sequence of 2 or more. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe task says \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So I think each such consecutive run is considered. For example, a horizontal row like 🌏🌏🌏 would contribute two lines: one of length 3 (which counts as a single line), but wait, no. Wait, maybe the approach is that any maximal line (the longest possible consecutive sequence) counts as one line. Or maybe each possible run of 2 or more, including overlapping ones. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. The problem's example might clarify.\n\nWait, let's think. For example, in a horizontal line of 3 same emojis, how many lines of 2 or more are there? If they are consecutive, the maximal line is length 3, which counts as 1 line. But if the problem counts all possible sequences (like in the first two emojis, the next two, etc.), then it would be 2 lines. But I need to know how the problem defines a line here. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says \"a length of 2 or more\". So each consecutive group of 2 or more in the same direction. For example, a horizontal line of 3 same emojis would have two possible lines: the first two and the last two. But maybe that's not the case. Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the entire consecutive run as a single line. For example, a run of 4 same emojis in a row would be counted as one horizontal line. Because if you count every possible sub-run, then a 4-length would have 3 (length 2) plus 2 (length 3) plus 1 (length4) → total 6? But that seems unlikely. Probably, the problem counts each maximal consecutive sequence of the same emoji in a row or column. So a run of 3 would be considered as one line of length 3, which counts as a single line (since length >=2).\n\nWait, the problem says \"the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So each line is a consecutive sequence (horizontal or vertical) of same emojis of length >=2. So for example, a horizontal line of 3 same emojis would be one line. Because it's a single line of length 3. But how about if there's a horizontal line of 4 same emojis, then that's a single line of length 4, which counts as one. So the approach is to look for all maximal consecutive sequences (i.e., not part of a longer sequence) in horizontal and vertical directions. No, wait, no. Because a longer sequence would include shorter ones. But the problem wants the total count of lines. Wait, perhaps the problem counts each possible line that can be formed by consecutive emojis of the same type, regardless of being part of a longer line. For example, a horizontal line of 3 same emojis would contribute two lines: one of length 2 (positions 1-2) and another of length 2 (positions 2-3), and the entire length 3 (positions 1-3) as a line of length 3. So each possible consecutive group of 2 or more. But that would result in a higher count. But the problem statement is a bit ambiguous here. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states: \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So perhaps each line is considered as a sequence of two or more consecutive same emojis in the same row (for horizontal) or column (for vertical). So the question is, for each row, check each run of same emojis. For example, in a row like AAABBB, there are two runs: AAA (length 3) and BBB (length 3). Each contributes 1 line. So each run of length >=2 counts as one line. Similarly for columns. So the total is the sum of all such runs in all rows (horizontal) and all columns (vertical) that have length >=2.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for each row, we look for consecutive same emojis in the row (horizontal lines) and count each run once if its length is >=2. Similarly for each column. Then sum all of these.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each row, process each horizontal run of same emojis. For each run, if the length is >=2, add 1 to the count.\n\n2. For each column, process each vertical run of same emojis. For each run, if the length is >=2, add 1 to the count.\n\n3. Sum all these counts for rows and columns. That is the answer.\n\nSo for example, the first row of the given board is 🌏🌏🌏🐔🐟🌏. Let's process the horizontal runs:\n\nFirst three 🌏 → length 3 → count 1.\n\nThen 🐔 (length 1) → no.\n\nThen 🐟 (length 1) → no.\n\nThen 🌏 (length 1) → no.\n\nSo row 1 contributes 1 to horizontal lines.\n\nSimilarly, process each row and column.\n\nNow let's process all rows and columns.\n\nLet's list all rows:\n\nRow 0: 🌏🌏🌏🐔🐟🌏 → runs: 3🌏, 1🐔, 1🐟, 1🌏 → only the first run (length 3) counts. So +1.\n\nRow 1: 🐟🐟🐟🐔🌏☁️ → runs: 3🐟, 1🐔, 1🌏, 1☁️. So +1.\n\nRow 2: 🌏🌏🌏🌏☁️☁️ → runs: 4🌏, 2☁️ → both contribute. So +2.\n\nRow 3: 🌏☁️🐔🐔🐔🌏 → runs: 1🌏, 1☁️, 3🐔, 1🌏. So the 3🐔 run contributes. So +1.\n\nRow 4: 🐔🐔🌏☁️🐟🐟 → runs: 2🐔 (counts), 1🌏, 1☁️, 2🐟 (counts). So +2.\n\nRow 5: 🐟🐔🐔🌏☁️🐔 → runs: 1🐟, 2🐔 (counts), 1🌏, 1☁️, 1🐔. So +1.\n\nSo sum for rows: 1 +1 +2 +1 +2 +1 = 8.\n\nNow columns. Let's process each column for vertical runs.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow0: 🌏\n\nRow1: 🐟\n\nRow2: 🌏\n\nRow3: 🌏\n\nRow4: 🐔\n\nRow5: 🐟\n\nSo the column has elements: 🌏, 🐟, 🌏, 🌏, 🐔, 🐟. The runs here are:\n\n🌏 (1), 🐟 (1), 🌏 (2 → counts?), then 🐔 (1), 🐟 (1). Wait, let's list all elements vertically:\n\nLooking at column 0:\n\nRow0: 🌏\n\nRow1: 🐟\n\nRow2: 🌏\n\nRow3: 🌏\n\nRow4: 🐔\n\nRow5: 🐟\n\nSo the vertical sequence is [🌏, 🐟, 🌏, 🌏, 🐔, 🐟]. Let's break into runs:\n\nStart at row0: 🌏 (1). Then row1 is 🐟 (new run, length 1). Then row2 is 🌏 (new run). Now row3 is same as row2 (🌏), so run length becomes 2. Then row4 is 🐔 (new run, length 1). Then row5 is 🐟 (new run, length 1).\n\nSo in column 0, the runs are:\n\n1: 🌏 (1)\n\n2: 🐟 (1)\n\n3: 🌏 (2 → counts as >=2)\n\n4: 🐔 (1)\n\n5: 🐟 (1)\n\nSo column 0 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow0: 🌏\n\nRow1: 🐟\n\nRow2: 🌏\n\nRow3: ☁️\n\nRow4: 🐔\n\nRow5: 🐔\n\nSequence: 🌏, 🐟, 🌏, ☁️, 🐔, 🐔.\n\nRuns:\n\n🌏 (1)\n\n🐟 (1)\n\n🌏 (1)\n\n☁️ (1)\n\n🐔 (2 → counts → +1)\n\nSo column1 contributes 1.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: 🌏\n\nRow1: 🐟\n\nRow2: 🌏\n\nRow3: 🐔\n\nRow4: 🌏\n\nRow5: 🐔\n\nSequence: 🌏, 🐟, 🌏, 🐔, 🌏, 🐔.\n\nRuns:\n\n🌏 (1)\n\n🐟 (1)\n\n🌏 (1)\n\n🐔 (1)\n\n🌏 (1)\n\n🐔 (1)\n\nNo runs of length >=2. So column2 contributes 0.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🐔\n\nRow1: 🐔\n\nRow2: 🌏\n\nRow3: 🐔\n\nRow4: ☁️\n\nRow5: 🌏\n\nSequence: 🐔, 🐔, 🌏, 🐔, ☁️, 🌏.\n\nRuns:\n\n🐔 (2 → counts → +1)\n\n🌏 (1)\n\n🐔 (1)\n\n☁️ (1)\n\n🌏 (1)\n\nSo column3 contributes 1.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow0: 🐟\n\nRow1: 🌏\n\nRow2: ☁️\n\nRow3: 🐔\n\nRow4: 🐟\n\nRow5: ☁️\n\nSequence: 🐟, 🌏, ☁️, 🐔, 🐟, ☁️. All single runs. So no contributions.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow0: 🌏\n\nRow1: ☁️\n\nRow2: ☁️\n\nRow3: 🌏\n\nRow4: 🐟\n\nRow5: 🐔\n\nSequence: 🌏, ☁️, ☁️, 🌏, 🐟, 🐔.\n\nRuns:\n\n🌏 (1)\n\n☁️ (2 → counts → +1)\n\n🌏 (1)\n\n🐟 (1)\n\n🐔 (1)\n\nSo column5 contributes 1.\n\nNow sum up the columns: column0:1, column1:1, column3:1, column5:1. Wait, let's check again.\n\nWait columns are 0-5.\n\nWait columns 0:1, 1:1, 2:0, 3:1, 4:0, 5:1. So total for columns is 1+1+0+1+0+1=4.\n\nSo total lines are rows (8) + columns (4) = 12.\n\nWait but let me recheck each column to make sure.\n\nRechecking column0:\n\nVertical runs:\n\nRow0: 🌏\n\nRow1: 🐟 (different → new run, length 1)\n\nRow2: 🌏 (different → new run, length 1)\n\nRow3: 🌏 (same as previous → run becomes 2. So this is a run of length 2 starting at row2 and including row3. So that's one run of length 2, contributing 1.\n\nRow4: 🐔 (different → new run, length 1)\n\nRow5: 🐟 (different → new run, length 1)\n\nSo column0 has one run of length 2. So yes, contributes 1.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow0: 🌏\n\nRow1: 🐟 → different run. So run1 ends (length 1). Run2 starts (🐟, length1).\n\nRow2: 🌏 → new run (length1).\n\nRow3: ☁ → new run (length1).\n\nRow4: 🐔 → new run (length1).\n\nRow5: 🐔 → same as previous → run becomes 2. So contributes 1.\n\nYes, column1 contributes 1.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🐔\n\nRow1: 🐔 → run continues (length2 → counts).\n\nRow2: 🌏 → new run (length1).\n\nRow3: 🐔 → new run (length1).\n\nRow4: ☁ → new run (length1).\n\nRow5: 🌏 → new run (length1).\n\nSo column3 has a run of length 2 → contributes 1.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow0: 🌏 (length1).\n\nRow1: ☁️ (new run, length1).\n\nRow2: ☁️ (same as previous → run length2 → contributes 1).\n\nSo column5's run is in rows1-2. So that's one.\n\nSo columns sum to 4.\n\nTotal answer would be 8 (rows) +4 (columns) = 12.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck all rows again.\n\nRows:\n\nRow0: 🌏🌏🌏🐔🐟🌏 → runs: 3🌏 → 1.\n\nRow1: 🐟🐟🐟🐔🌏☁️ → runs:3 🐟 →1.\n\nRow2: 🌏🌏🌏🌏☁️☁️ → 4🌏 (1) and 2☁️ (1) → total 2.\n\nRow3: 🌏☁️🐔🐔🐔🌏 → runs: 3 🐔 →1.\n\nRow4: 🐔🐔🌏☁️🐟🐟 → 2 🐔 →1, 2 🐟 →1. So total 2.\n\nRow5: 🐟🐔🐔🌏☁️🐔 → runs: 2 🐔 →1.\n\nSo rows contribute 1+1+2+1+2+1=8. Correct.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumns 0:1\n\n1:1\n\n3:1\n\n5:1. But wait columns 5 has a run of 2 ☁️. Let's check column5 again.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow0: 🌏\n\nRow1: ☁️\n\nRow2: ☁️\n\nRow3: 🌏\n\nRow4: 🐟\n\nRow5: 🐔\n\nSo sequence: 🌏, ☁️, ☁️, 🌏, 🐟, 🐔.\n\nThe runs here are:\n\n🌏 (1), ☁️ (2 → counts → +1), 🌏 (1), 🐟 (1), 🐔 (1). So yes, column5 contributes 1.\n\nColumns:\n\n0:1\n\n1:1\n\n3:1\n\n5:1 → but what about column4?\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow0: 🐟\n\nRow1: 🌏\n\nRow2: ☁️\n\nRow3: 🐔\n\nRow4: 🐟\n\nRow5: ☁️\n\nEach is different from the next, so no runs. So column4 contributes 0.\n\nOther columns:\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: 🌏\n\nRow1: 🐟\n\nRow2: 🌏\n\nRow3: 🐔\n\nRow4: 🌏\n\nRow5: 🐔\n\nNo runs of 2. So 0.\n\nSo columns: 0:1, 1:1, 2:0, 3:1,4:0,5:1. Sum is 1+1+0+1+0+1=4.\n\nTotal answer is 8+4=12.\n\nBut wait, let me look again. Maybe there's a column that I missed.\n\nWait, column1's row5 is 🐔. Let me recheck column1.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow0: 🌏 (second emoji in row0 is 🌏, so column1 for row0 is the second emoji. Wait wait! Wait, the columns are 0-5, and each row is a list of emojis. So for example, row0 is:\n\nRow0: [0]🌏, [1]🌏, [2]🌏, [3]🐔, [4]🐟, [5]🌏.\n\nSo column0 is the first emoji of each row. Column1 is the second emoji of each row.\n\nWait, but in row1, the second emoji is 🐟?\n\nRow1: 🐟🐟🐟🐔🌏☁️ → positions 0-5: 🐟, 🐟, 🐟, 🐔, 🌏, ☁️.\n\nSo column1 for row1 is 🐟.\n\nRow2: 🌏🌏🌏🌏☁️☁️ → positions 0-5: 🌏, 🌏, 🌏, 🌏, ☁️, ☁️. So column1 is 🌏.\n\nRow3: 🌏☁️🐔🐔🐔🌏 → positions 0-5: 🌏, ☁️, 🐔, 🐔, 🐔, 🌏. Column1 is ☁️.\n\nRow4: 🐔🐔🌏☁️🐟🐟 → positions 0-5: 🐔, 🐔, 🌏, ☁️, 🐟, 🐟. Column1 is 🐔.\n\nRow5: 🐟🐔🐔🌏☁️🐔 → positions 0-5: 🐟, 🐔, 🐔, 🌏, ☁️, 🐔. Column1 is 🐔.\n\nSo column1's sequence is:\n\nRow0: 🌏 (position1)\n\nRow1: 🐟 (position1)\n\nRow2: 🌏 (position1)\n\nRow3: ☁️ (position1)\n\nRow4: 🐔 (position1)\n\nRow5: 🐔 (position1)\n\nSo the vertical sequence for column1 is [🌏, 🐟, 🌏, ☁️, 🐔, 🐔].\n\nLooking for runs:\n\nStart with 🌏 (1). Then next is 🐟 → new run (1). Next is 🌏 → new run (1). Next is ☁️ → new run (1). Then next two are 🐔 (row4 and row5, position1). So in row4 and 5, it's 🐔 and 🐔. So run starts at row4 with 🐔, continues to row5 → length 2. So this contributes 1.\n\nSo column1 contributes 1.\n\nSo yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother check: column3. Let's see.\n\nColumn3 is the fourth position (index 3) of each row.\n\nRow0: 🐔 (position3)\n\nRow1: 🐔 (position3)\n\nRow2: 🌏 (position3)\n\nRow3: 🐔 (position3)\n\nRow4: ☁️ (position3)\n\nRow5: 🌏 (position3)\n\nSo sequence: 🐔, 🐔, 🌏, 🐔, ☁️, 🌏.\n\nRuns:\n\n🐔 (row0 and row1 → 2 → counts → +1).\n\nThen 🌏 (row2, 1).\n\nThen 🐔 (row3, 1).\n\nThen ☁️ (row4, 1).\n\nThen 🌏 (row5,1).\n\nSo column3 contributes 1.\n\nNow, let's check column5.\n\nColumn5 is the sixth position (index5).\n\nRow0: 🌏 (position5)\n\nRow1: ☁️ (position5)\n\nRow2: ☁️ (position5)\n\nRow3: 🌏 (position5)\n\nRow4: 🐟 (position5)\n\nRow5: 🐔 (position5)\n\nSequence: 🌏, ☁️, ☁️, 🌏, 🐟, 🐔.\n\nRuns: 🌏 (1), ☁️ (2 → counts →+1), 🌏 (1), 🐟 (1), 🐔 (1).\n\nSo column5 contributes 1.\n\nSo columns sum to 4. Correct.\n\nThus, the total is 8+4=12.\n\nBut wait, I'm now getting 12 as the answer. Let me recheck all counts again to make sure.\n\nRows:\n\nRow0: 3 → 1.\n\nRow1:3 → 1.\n\nRow2:4 and 2 → 2.\n\nRow3:3 →1.\n\nRow4:2 and 2 →2.\n\nRow5:2 →1.\n\nSum: 1+1+2+1+2+1=8. Correct.\n\nColumns:\n\n0:1\n\n1:1\n\n2:0\n\n3:1\n\n4:0\n\n5:1.\n\nSum: 4.\n\nTotal 12.\n\nBut wait, what about column2?\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: 🌏 (position2)\n\nRow1: 🐟 (position2)\n\nRow2: 🌏 (position2)\n\nRow3: 🐔 (position2)\n\nRow4: 🌏 (position2)\n\nRow5: 🌏 (position2).\n\nSequence: 🌏, 🐟, 🌏, 🐔, 🌏, 🌏.\n\nRuns:\n\n🌏 (1)\n\n🐟 (1)\n\n🌏 (1)\n\n🐔 (1)\n\n🌏 (2 → counts →+1).\n\nWait, rows4 and 5 in column2 are both 🌏. So in column2:\n\nRow4 and 5: 🌏 → run of 2. So column2 contributes 1?\n\nOh wait, I think I made a mistake here earlier.\n\nLet me recheck column2.\n\nColumn2 (index2 of each row):\n\nRow0: 🌏\n\nRow1: 🐟\n\nRow2: 🌏\n\nRow3: 🐔\n\nRow4: 🌏\n\nRow5: 🌏\n\nSo the vertical sequence is [🌏, 🐟, 🌏, 🐔, 🌏, 🌏].\n\nLet's break into runs:\n\nRow0: 🌏 (start run 1, length1).\n\nRow1: 🐟 (new run, length1).\n\nRow2: 🌏 (new run, length1).\n\nRow3: 🐔 (new run, length1).\n\nRow4: 🌏 (new run, length1). Then row5: 🌏 (same as row4 → run becomes length2 → so this run is from row4 to row5, length2 → contributes 1.\n\nSo column2 now has a run of 2, which I had previously missed. So column2 contributes 1, not 0.\n\nThat's a mistake in the previous calculation. So columns:\n\n0:1\n\n1:1\n\n2:1\n\n3:1\n\n4:0\n\n5:1.\n\nSum is 1+1+1+1+0+1=5.\n\nSo total is 8 (rows) +5 (columns) =13.\n\nWait, this changes the answer. So I need to correct this.\n\nNow, let me recheck column2 again.\n\nColumn2's vertical sequence:\n\nRows:\n\n0: 🌏\n\n1: 🐟\n\n2: 🌏\n\n3: 🐔\n\n4: 🌏\n\n5: 🌏\n\nSo the runs are:\n\n🌏 (row0) → 1.\n\n🐟 (row1) →1.\n\n🌏 (row2) →1.\n\n🐔 (row3) →1.\n\n🌏 (row4) and row5: two 🌏 → run of 2 → counts.\n\nSo in column2, there's a run of 2 → contributing 1.\n\nSo columns sum is 1 (col0) +1 (col1) +1 (col2) +1 (col3) +0 (col4) +1 (col5) = 5.\n\nThus, total answer is 8 +5 =13.\n\nBut I need to recheck all columns again.\n\nLet's recheck all columns carefully.\n\nColumn0:\n\nRow0: 🌏\n\nRow1: 🐟\n\nRow2: 🌏\n\nRow3: 🌏\n\nRow4: 🐔\n\nRow5: 🐟\n\nSequence: 🌏, 🐟, 🌏, 🌏, 🐔, 🐟.\n\nRuns: 🌏 (1); 🐟 (1); 🌏 (2 → counts →+1); 🐔 (1); 🐟 (1). So 1.\n\nColumn1:\n\nSequence: 🌏, 🐟, 🌏, ☁️, 🐔, 🐔.\n\nRuns: 🌏 (1), 🐟 (1), 🌏 (1), ☁️ (1), 🐔 (2 → counts →+1). Total 1.\n\nColumn2:\n\nSequence: 🌏, 🐟, 🌏, 🐔, 🌏, 🌏.\n\nRuns: 🌏 (1), 🐟 (1), 🌏 (1), 🐔 (1), 🌏 (2 → counts →+1). So 1.\n\nColumn3:\n\nSequence: 🐔, 🐔, 🌏, 🐔, ☁️, 🌏.\n\nRuns: 🐔 (2 → counts →+1), 🌏 (1), 🐔 (1), ☁️ (1), 🌏 (1). So 1.\n\nColumn4:\n\nSequence: 🐟, 🌏, ☁️, 🐔, 🐟, ☁️.\n\nRuns: all 1 → no contribution.\n\nColumn5:\n\nSequence: 🌏, ☁️, ☁️, 🌏, 🐟, 🐔.\n\nRuns: 🌏 (1), ☁️ (2 → counts →+1), 🌏 (1), 🐟 (1), 🐔 (1). So 1.\n\nSo columns sum: 1+1+1+1+0+1=5.\n\nSo total lines are 8 (rows) +5 (columns) =13.\n\nAh, so the previous answer of 12 was wrong due to missing a column2 contribution. Now the answer is 13.\n\nBut wait, let me check all rows again, just to be sure.\n\nRows:\n\nRow0: 3 → 1.\n\nRow1:3 →1.\n\nRow2:4 and 2 →2.\n\nRow3:3 →1.\n\nRow4: 2 and 2 →2.\n\nRow5:2 →1.\n\nTotal rows:8.\n\nColumns:\n\n5 columns contributing 1 each (columns0,1,2,3,5) → 5.\n\nSo total 13.\n\nYes. So the correct answer is 13.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji on a 6x6 grid, where each line has a length of 2 or more. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Horizontal Lines**: For each row, identify consecutive sequences (runs) of the same emoji. Each run of length ≥2 contributes 1 to the count.\n2. **Vertical Lines**: For each column, identify consecutive sequences (runs) of the same emoji.

The lines have to be of length 2 or more. Hmm. Let me think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the board. It's a rectangular grid. Each row is a line of emojis. The problem mentions horizontal and vertical lines. For horizontal lines, each consecutive same emoji in a row contributes. For vertical lines, consecutive same emojis in the same column.\n\nWait, but the question says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". So, each such line counts as one, even if there are overlapping parts. Wait, no. Wait, for example, if a row has three same emojis in a row, like AAA, that counts as a single horizontal line of length 3. But the problem says \"lines of length 2 or more\". So in that case, the entire run of 3 would count as one line. Or maybe each possible sub-line of length >=2? Like, for three in a row (AAA), that's two lines of length 2 and one of length 3. Wait, but the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji\", so I think each consecutive run is considered as a single line. Wait, the problem says \"lines\" as in sequences of consecutive same emojis. For example, in a row like AABBBCC, the horizontal lines are BB and BBB (but maybe it's considered that the run of 3 B's counts as a single line of length 3, which is >=2, so counts as 1. Similarly, a run of 2 would count as 1. So each horizontal or vertical consecutive run of same emoji of length >=2 adds 1 to the total count.\n\nSo the approach is to check each row for horizontal runs and each column for vertical runs. For each run in a row or column that is length 2 or longer, add 1 to the total.\n\nSo first, process each row. Then process each column.\n\nLet me start by transcribing the given board.\n\nThe board is given as seven lines. Let's number the rows from 0 to 6 (top to bottom). Each row is a sequence of emojis. Let's check each row for horizontal runs.\n\nRow 0: 🦎🦎🐡😄🐡🌍😄\nSo the sequence is L, L, F, E, F, G, E (using letters to represent different emojis for ease). So looking for consecutive same. The first two L's are a run of 2. Then nothing else. So horizontal runs here: 1.\n\nRow 1: 🦎🌍🤚🐡🌍🌍🤚\nRow is L, G, H, F, G, G, H. So the two G's (positions 4-5) form a run of 2. So that's 1 horizontal run.\n\nRow 2: 🌍🌍😄😄🌍🌍😄\nRow is G, G, E, E, G, G, E. Let's check consecutive runs. The first two G's (run of 2). Then two E's (run of 2). Then two G's (run of 2). And the last E is single. So three horizontal runs here.\n\nRow 3: 🌍🐡🦄🤚😄🦄🤚\nG, F, U, H, E, U, H. No consecutive same in a row. So no horizontal runs here.\n\nRow 4: 🤚🤚🦎🤚🦄🌍🤚\nH, H, L, H, U, G, H. The first two H's (run of 2). Then no other consecutive. So 1 horizontal run here.\n\nRow 5: 🦄🌍🐡🐡🤚🤚🦎\nU, G, F, F, H, H, L. The F's (positions 2-3) run of 2. The H's (4-5) run of 2. So two horizontal runs here.\n\nRow 6: 🤚🦎😄😄🦄😄🦄\nH, L, E, E, U, E, U. The E's (positions 2-3) run of 2. So 1 horizontal run here.\n\nSo total horizontal runs: 1 + 1 + 3 + 0 +1 + 2 +1 = sum them up: 1+1=2; +3=5; +0=5; +1=6; +2=8; +1=9. So horizontal lines contribute 9.\n\nNow for vertical lines. Need to check each column for consecutive same emojis. Since the board has 7 rows and each row has 7 emojis (assuming all rows are same length), the columns are 7 columns (index 0-6). So for each column, check from top to bottom for consecutive runs.\n\nLet me list each column:\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow 0: 🦎 (L)\nRow 1: 🦎 (L)\nRow 2: 🌍 (G)\nRow 3: 🌍 (G)\nRow 4: 🤚 (H)\nRow 5: 🦄 (U)\nRow 6: 🤚 (H)\n\nSo the sequence is L, L, G, G, H, U, H.\n\nLooking for vertical runs. Check consecutive same in the column.\n\nRow 0-1: L and L → run of 2. Then row 2 is G, which is different. So vertical run here of length 2 → 1 count.\n\nRow 2-3: G and G → run of 2. So another count.\n\nRow 4: H, row5: U (different). Row6: H. No runs here.\n\nSo column 0 has two vertical runs (each of length 2). Wait, wait. Wait, the column is:\n\nL (row0), L (row1), G (row2), G (row3), H (row4), U (row5), H (row6).\n\nSo in column 0:\n\nRow0 and row1: same (L), that's a vertical run of length 2. Then row2 and row3: same (G), another run of 2. Then row4 is H, no run. Row5 is U, different. Row6 is H, no. So total vertical runs in column 0: 2.\n\nWait, but each run is considered as a single line. So each consecutive run in the column that is >=2 in length counts as 1. So even if there's a run of 3 in a column, that's one count. So for column 0, two separate runs (LL and GG), each of length 2. So that's two vertical lines.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow0: 🦎 (L)\nRow1: 🌍 (G)\nRow2: 🌍 (G)\nRow3: 🐡 (F)\nRow4: 🤚 (H)\nRow5: 🌍 (G)\nRow6: 🦎 (L)\n\nSequence: L, G, G, F, H, G, L.\n\nLooking for consecutive same in column. Rows 1-2: G-G (run of 2). That's one. Others are single. So column1 has 1 vertical run.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow0: 🐡 (F)\nRow1: 🤚 (H)\nRow2: 😄 (E)\nRow3: 🦄 (U)\nRow4: 🦎 (L)\nRow5: 🐡 (F)\nRow6: 😄 (E)\n\nSequence: F, H, E, U, L, F, E. All different. No consecutive runs. So column2 has 0 vertical lines.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 😄 (E)\nRow1: 🐡 (F)\nRow2: 😄 (E)\nRow3: 🤚 (H)\nRow4: 🤚 (H)\nRow5: 🐡 (F)\nRow6: 😄 (E)\n\nSequence: E, F, E, H, H, F, E.\n\nLooking for consecutive same. Rows 3-4: H-H (run of 2). So that's 1 vertical run. Others are single. So column3 contributes 1.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow0: 🐡 (F)\nRow1: 🌍 (G)\nRow2: 🌍 (G)\nRow3: 😄 (E)\nRow4: 🦄 (U)\nRow5: 🤚 (H)\nRow6: 🦄 (U)\n\nSequence: F, G, G, E, U, H, U.\n\nConsecutive runs: rows1-2: G-G (run of 2). So 1 vertical line here.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow0: 🌍 (G)\nRow1: 🌍 (G)\nRow2: 🌍 (G)\nRow3: 🦄 (U)\nRow4: 🌍 (G)\nRow5: 🤚 (H)\nRow6: 😄 (E)\n\nSequence: G, G, G, U, G, H, E.\n\nCheck vertical runs. Rows0-1-2: three G's. That's a run of 3 → counts as 1. Then row4 is G, but after U. So the three G's in a row (rows0-2) count as 1. Then row4 is G, but it's not consecutive with row3 (U). So column5 has 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn6:\n\nRow0: 😄 (E)\nRow1: 🤚 (H)\nRow2: 😄 (E)\nRow3: 🤚 (H)\nRow4: 🤚 (H)\nRow5: 🦎 (L)\nRow6: 🦄 (U)\n\nSequence: E, H, E, H, H, L, U.\n\nLooking for consecutive same in column. Rows3-4: H-H → run of 2. So that's 1 vertical line here.\n\nNow, summing vertical runs:\n\nColumn0: 2\nColumn1: 1\nColumn2:0\nColumn3:1\nColumn4:1\nColumn5:1\nColumn6:1\n\nTotal vertical lines: 2+1+0+1+1+1+1=7?\n\nWait wait, column0 has 2 vertical lines (LL and GG), each of length 2. So yes, column0 contributes 2. Then column1: 1 (GG), column3:1 (HH), column4:1 (GG), column5:1 (GGG), column6:1 (HH). So total vertical lines: 2+1+0+1+1+1+1=7.\n\nWait but column5 had GGG (3 in a row), but that counts as one line regardless of length. So that's correct.\n\nSo vertical lines contribute 7.\n\nNow total lines (horizontal + vertical) would be 9 +7=16.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me recheck the counts.\n\nHorizontal:\n\nRow0: 1 (LL)\nRow1:1 (GG)\nRow2:3 (GG, EE, GG)\nRow3:0\nRow4:1 (HH)\nRow5:2 (FF, HH)\nRow6:1 (EE)\nTotal horizontal:1+1+3+0+1+2+1=9. That's correct.\n\nVertical:\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn0: 2 (LL, GG)\nColumn1:1 (GG)\nColumn2:0\nColumn3:1 (HH)\nColumn4:1 (GG)\nColumn5:1 (GGG)\nColumn6:1 (HH)\nTotal vertical: 2+1+0+1+1+1+1=7.\n\nSo total lines: 9 +7 =16.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure that each vertical run is considered correctly. For example, in column5, the three G's (rows0-2) count as one line. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in column0, the runs are LL (rows0-1) and GG (rows2-3). So each is a separate run, so each counts as 1. So two vertical lines in column0. Yes. So vertical lines are 7.\n\nSo adding 9 horizontal and 7 vertical gives 16. Hmm. But let me double-check, perhaps I made a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recheck each row's horizontal runs.\n\nRow0: 🦎🦎🐡😄🐡🌍😄 → two in a row (LL), then others. So 1.\n\nRow1: 🦎🌍🤚🐡🌍🌍🤚 → GG in positions4-5. So 1.\n\nRow2: 🌍🌍😄😄🌍🌍😄 → GG, EE, GG. Each is two. So three runs. Yes.\n\nRow3: no consecutive runs.\n\nRow4: first two H's. So 1.\n\nRow5: FF and HH. So two runs.\n\nRow6: EE. So one.\n\nTotal horizontal 9: correct.\n\nVertical columns:\n\nColumn0:\n\nRows 0-1: LL → run of 2 → count 1.\n\nRows 2-3: GG → run of 2 → count 1.\n\nSo column0 has 2.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRows1-2: GG → 1.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRows3-4: HH →1.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRows1-2: GG →1. Because column4:\n\nRow0: F (row0 column4 is 🐡 (F)), row1: G (🌍?), wait wait.\n\nWait, column4 is the fifth emoji in each row (indices 0-6). Let me recheck the columns again.\n\nWait, each row is seven emojis. Let me re-express the board properly.\n\nRow 0: [ 🦎, 🦎, 🐡, 😄, 🐡, 🌍, 😄 ]\n\nRow1: [ 🦎, 🌍, 🤚, 🐡, 🌍, 🌍, 🤚 ]\n\nRow2: [ 🌍, 🌍, 😄, 😄, 🌍, 🌍, 😄 ]\n\nRow3: [ 🌍, 🐡, 🦄, 🤚, 😄, 🦄, 🤚 ]\n\nRow4: [ 🤚, 🤚, 🦎, 🤚, 🦄, 🌍, 🤚 ]\n\nRow5: [ 🦄, 🌍, 🐡, 🐡, 🤚, 🤚, 🦎 ]\n\nRow6: [ 🤚, 🦎, 😄, 😄, 🦄, 😄, 🦄 ]\n\nSo for column 0 (first emoji of each row):\n\nRow0: 🦎\n\nRow1: 🦎\n\nRow2: 🌍\n\nRow3: 🌍\n\nRow4: 🤚\n\nRow5: 🦄\n\nRow6: 🤚\n\nSo the sequence is L, L, G, G, H, U, H.\n\nSo runs: L-L (2) → count 1. G-G (2) → count 1. So column0 has two vertical runs. Correct.\n\nColumn1 (second emoji of each row):\n\nRow0: 🦎 (L)\n\nRow1: 🌍 (G)\n\nRow2: 🌍 (G)\n\nRow3: 🐡 (F)\n\nRow4: 🤚 (H)\n\nRow5: 🌍 (G)\n\nRow6: 🦎 (L)\n\nSequence: L, G, G, F, H, G, L.\n\nRuns: G-G (row1-2) → count 1. Column1 has 1 vertical run.\n\nColumn2 (third emoji):\n\nRow0: 🐡 (F)\n\nRow1: 🤚 (H)\n\nRow2: 😄 (E)\n\nRow3: 🦄 (U)\n\nRow4: 🦎 (L)\n\nRow5: 🐡 (F)\n\nRow6: 😄 (E)\n\nSequence: F, H, E, U, L, F, E. No consecutive duplicates. So 0.\n\nColumn3 (fourth emoji):\n\nRow0: 😄 (E)\n\nRow1: 🐡 (F)\n\nRow2: 😄 (E)\n\nRow3: 🤚 (H)\n\nRow4: 🤚 (H)\n\nRow5: 🐡 (F)\n\nRow6: 😄 (E)\n\nSequence: E, F, E, H, H, F, E.\n\nOnly H-H in rows3-4 → count 1.\n\nColumn4 (fifth emoji):\n\nRow0: 🐡 (F)\n\nRow1: 🌍 (G)\n\nRow2: 🌍 (G)\n\nRow3: 😄 (E)\n\nRow4: 🦄 (U)\n\nRow5: 🤚 (H)\n\nRow6: 🦄 (U)\n\nSequence: F, G, G, E, U, H, U.\n\nRuns: G-G in rows1-2 → count 1.\n\nColumn5 (sixth emoji):\n\nRow0: 🌍 (G)\n\nRow1: 🌍 (G)\n\nRow2: 🌍 (G)\n\nRow3: 🦄 (U)\n\nRow4: 🌍 (G)\n\nRow5: 🤚 (H)\n\nRow6: 😄 (E)\n\nSequence: G, G, G, U, G, H, E.\n\nRun: G-G-G (rows0-2) → one vertical run.\n\nColumn6 (seventh emoji):\n\nRow0: 😄 (E)\n\nRow1: 🤚 (H)\n\nRow2: 😄 (E)\n\nRow3: 🤚 (H)\n\nRow4: 🤚 (H)\n\nRow5: 🦎 (L)\n\nRow6: 🦄 (U)\n\nSequence: E, H, E, H, H, L, U.\n\nRuns: H-H in rows3-4 → one vertical run.\n\nSo summing vertical runs:\n\nColumn0:2, column1:1, column3:1, column4:1, column5:1, column6:1 → that's 2+1+1+1+1+1=7. Wait, what about column3? Yes, column3 (index 3) contributed 1. So vertical lines total 7.\n\nSo overall answer is 9+7=16.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. For example, column5 (GGGU...). The three G's in a row are a single vertical line. So that's correct.\n\nHmm. So the answer should be 16.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count horizontal and vertical lines of the same emoji with a length of 2 or more on the given board. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Horizontal Lines**: For each row, check consecutive emojis. Count each run of 2 or more consecutive emojis as one line.\n2. **Vertical Lines**: For each column, check consecutive emojis in the same way. Each run of 2 or more consecutive emojis counts as one line.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Define the board as a list of lists (rows)\nboard = [\n    ['🦎', '🦎', '🐡', '😄', '🐡', '🌍', '😄'],\n    ['🦎', '🌍', '🤚', '🐡', '🌍', '🌍', '🤚'],\n    ['🌍', '🌍', '😄', '😄', '🌍', '🌍', '😄'],\n    ['🌍', '🐡', '🦄', '🤚', '😄', '🦄', '🤚'],\n    ['🤚', '🤚', '🦎', '🤚', '🦄', '🌍', '🤚'],\n    ['🦄', '🌍', '🐡', '🐡', '🤚', '🤚', '🦎'],\n    ['🤚', '🦎', '😄', '😄', '🦄', '😄', '🦄']\n]\n\ndef count_lines(board):\n    rows = len(board)\n    cols = len(board[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    total = 0\n\n    # Horizontal lines\n    for r in range(rows):\n        current = board[r][0]\n        count = 1\n        for c in range(1, cols):\n            if board[r][c] == current:\n                count += 1\n            else:\n                if count >= 2:\n                    total += 1\n                current = board[r][c]\n                count = 1\n        if count >= 2:\n            total += 1\n\n    # Vertical lines\n    for c in range(cols):\n        current = board[0][c]\n        count = 1\n        for r in range(1, rows):\n            if board[r][c] == current:\n                count += 1\n            else:\n                if count >= 2:\n                    total += 1\n                current = board[r][c]\n                count = 1\n        if count >= 2:\n            total += 1\n\n    return total\n\nprint(count_lines(board))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Horizontal Check**: For each row, iterate through each emoji and track consecutive occurrences. If a run of 2 or more is found, increment the total count.\n2. **Vertical Check**: For each column, iterate through each row and track consecutive occurrences in the same way. Increment the total count for valid runs.\n3. **Summing Results**: The total number of valid lines is the sum of horizontal and vertical lines counted.\n\nAnswer: 16"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines made of the same emoji with length 2 or more on this board. Hmm, the board is a grid of emojis. So each line can be a row (horizontal) or column (vertical) sequence of the same emoji, and each such line of length >=2 counts. Wait, but maybe I need to check each possible line in both directions.\n\nWait, but wait, the lines can be of any length as long as they are consecutive same emojis. So for example, in a row, if there are three same emojis in a row, that's a line of length 3. But perhaps overlapping lines? Like, three in a row would count as two lines (positions 1-2 and 2-3?), or does each maximal run of the same emoji count as one line? Like, a run of length 3 would contribute one line (since it's a single line of length 3). Because the problem says lines formed by the same emoji, so a contiguous sequence. So each maximal run of the same emoji in a row or column counts as a line. And for each such run, if its length is >=2, we add 1 to the count. Then sum all such runs in all rows and columns.\n\nSo the approach is: process each row, check each run of same emojis, count how many runs have length >=2. Then process each column, same thing. Sum all those counts.\n\nSo first, let's look at the input. The board is given as 10 rows (since each line is a row) with 10 emojis each. So 10x10 grid.\n\nLet me try to process each row first.\n\nTake the first row: 🎋🌲🦍🦍🐈🌲🌲🦐🌷🌲\n\nLet's split into runs:\n\nStart with the first emoji: 🎋. Next is 🌲, different. So run of 1, no count. Then 🌲, then next two are 🦍🦍. Wait, let's go step by step.\n\nRow 1: positions 0-9 (assuming 0-based index).\n\nElements:\n\n0: 🎋\n\n1: 🌲\n\n2: 🦍\n\n3: 🦍\n\n4: 🐈\n\n5: 🌲\n\n6: 🌲\n\n7: 🦐\n\n8: 🌷\n\n9: 🌲\n\nSo processing this row:\n\nCurrent emoji: 🎋 (count=1). Next is 🌲, different. So run ends. Since count is 1, no contribution.\n\nNext, 🌲 (count=1). Next is 🦍 (different). Run ends. No count.\n\nThen 🦍 at 2 and 3. So count starts at 2, next is same. So run length is 2. So add 1 to the total.\n\nNext is 🐈 (count=1). Next is 🌲 (diff). Run ends. No.\n\nThen 🌲 at 5 and 6: run of 2. Add 1.\n\nThen 🦐 (1), then 🌷 (1), then 🌲 (1). So in row 1, there are two runs of length >=2: the two 🦍s and the two 🌲s. So row 1 contributes 2.\n\nRow 2: 🐈🦍🌲🐈🌷🐈😃😃🌲🦍\n\nLooking at the elements:\n\n0: 🐈\n\n1: 🦍\n\n2: 🌲\n\n3: 🐈\n\n4: 🌷\n\n5: 🐈\n\n6: 😃\n\n7: 😃\n\n8: 🌲\n\n9: 🦍\n\nRuns:\n\n🐈 (1) → next is 🦍. No count.\n\n🦍 (1) → next is 🌲. No.\n\n🌲 (1) → next 🐈. No.\n\n🐈 (1) → next 🌷. No.\n\n🌷 (1) → next 🐈. No.\n\n🐈 (1) → next 😃. No.\n\nThen 😃 at 6 and 7: run of 2. Add 1.\n\nThen 🌲 (1), 🦍 (1). So row 2 contributes 1.\n\nRow 3: 🌲🦐🌲🎋🌻🦐😃🎋🌷🌲\n\nElements:\n\n0: 🌲\n\n1: 🦐\n\n2: 🌲\n\n3: 🎋\n\n4: 🌻\n\n5: 🦐\n\n6: 😃\n\n7: 🎋\n\n8: 🌷\n\n9: 🌲\n\nRuns:\n\n🌲 (1) → next 🦐. No.\n\n🦐 (1) → next 🌲. No.\n\n🌲 (1) → next 🎋. No.\n\n🎋 (1) → next 🌻. No.\n\n🌻 (1) → next 🦐. No.\n\n🦐 (1) → next 😃. No.\n\n😃 (1) → next 🎋. No.\n\n🎋 (1) → next 🌷. No.\n\n🌷 (1) → next 🌲. No.\n\nSo row 3 has zero runs of length >=2. So contributes 0.\n\nRow 4: 🐈🌲🌻🐈🦐🦍😃🌷🌲🌲\n\nElements:\n\n0: 🐈\n\n1: 🌲\n\n2: 🌻\n\n3: 🐈\n\n4: 🦐\n\n5: 🦍\n\n6: 😃\n\n7: 🌷\n\n8: 🌲\n\n9: 🌲\n\nRuns:\n\n🐈 (1) → next 🌲. No.\n\n🌲 (1) → next 🌻. No.\n\n🌻 (1) → next 🐈. No.\n\n🐈 (1) → next 🦐. No.\n\n🦐 (1) → next 🦍. No.\n\n🦍 (1) → next 😃. No.\n\n😃 (1) → next 🌷. No.\n\n🌷 (1) → next 🌲. No.\n\n🌲 at 8 and 9: run of 2. Add 1.\n\nSo row 4 contributes 1.\n\nRow 5: 🦐😃😃🌻🌷😃🐈😃😃🐈\n\nElements:\n\n0: 🦐\n\n1: 😃\n\n2: 😃\n\n3: 🌻\n\n4: 🌷\n\n5: 😃\n\n6: 🐈\n\n7: 😃\n\n8: 😃\n\n9: 🐈\n\nProcessing:\n\n🦐 (1) → no.\n\n😃 at 1 and 2: run of 2. Add 1.\n\n🌻 (1), 🌷 (1), 😃 (1) → next 🐈. No.\n\nThen 🐈 (1).\n\n😃 at 7,8: run of 2. Add another 1.\n\nSo row 5 has two runs (positions 1-2 and 7-8). So contributes 2.\n\nRow 6: 😃🌻😃🌻😃🐈🌷🦍🎋🦐\n\nElements:\n\n0: 😃\n\n1: 🌻\n\n2: 😃\n\n3: 🌻\n\n4: 😃\n\n5: 🐈\n\n6: 🌷\n\n7: 🦍\n\n8: 🎋\n\n9: 🦐\n\nEach emoji is changing. So no runs of >=2. So contributes 0.\n\nRow 7: 🐈🐈🎋🦐😃🌻🦍🦐🌻🌻\n\nElements:\n\n0: 🐈\n\n1: 🐈\n\n2: 🎋\n\n3: 🦐\n\n4: 😃\n\n5: 🌻\n\n6: 🦍\n\n7: 🦐\n\n8: 🌻\n\n9: 🌻\n\nRuns:\n\n🐈 at 0 and 1: run of 2. Add 1.\n\nThen 🎋 (1), 🦐 (1), 😃 (1), 🌻 (1), 🦍 (1), 🦐 (1).\n\nThen 🌻 at 8 and 9: run of 2. Add 1.\n\nSo row 7 contributes 2.\n\nRow 8: 🌻🦍🐈🎋🐈🌻🐈🎋🌷🌲\n\nElements:\n\n0: 🌻\n\n1: 🦍\n\n2: 🐈\n\n3: 🎋\n\n4: 🐈\n\n5: 🌻\n\n6: 🐈\n\n7: 🎋\n\n8: 🌷\n\n9: 🌲\n\nNo consecutive same emojis. Each is followed by a different. So contributes 0.\n\nRow 9: 🦍🌷🐈🦍🦍🌻🌻🌷🌲🎋\n\nElements:\n\n0: 🦍\n\n1: 🌷\n\n2: 🐈\n\n3: 🦍\n\n4: 🦍\n\n5: 🌻\n\n6: 🌻\n\n7: 🌷\n\n8: 🌲\n\n9: 🎋\n\nRuns:\n\n🦍 (0) → no.\n\nThen 🦍 at 3 and 4: run of 2. Add 1.\n\n🌻 at 5 and 6: run of 2. Add 1.\n\nSo row 9 contributes 2.\n\nRow 10 (assuming it's 10 rows, but looking back, the initial input shows 10 lines. Wait, the problem says the user provided 10 rows, each with 10 emojis. So rows 0-9 in code terms. Wait, the user's input shows 10 lines. Let me recount the lines given:\n\nThe board given has 10 lines. Let me check:\n\nLine 1: 🎋🌲🦍🦍🐈🌲🌲🦐🌷🌲 → row 0.\n\nThen lines 2 to 10 make rows 1 to 9. So total 10 rows. So processing each row:\n\nRow 0: 2 runs.\n\nRow 1: 1.\n\nRow 2:0.\n\nRow3:0.\n\nRow4:1.\n\nRow5:2.\n\nRow6:0.\n\nRow7:2.\n\nRow8:0.\n\nRow9:2.\n\nWait, row 9 is the last one:\n\nThe last line is 🎋🐈🎋😃😃😃🌲🐈🐈🐈 → Let me recheck.\n\nWait, looking back at the input:\n\nThe board lines are:\n\nLine 1: 🎋🌲🦍🦍🐈🌲🌲🦐🌷🌲\n\nLine 2: 🐈🦍🌲🐈🌷🐈😃😃🌲🦍\n\nLine 3: 🌲🦐🌲🎋🌻🦐😃🎋🌷🌲\n\nLine 4: 🐈🌲🌻🐈🦐🦍😃🌷🌲🌲\n\nLine 5: 🦐😃😃🌻🌷😃🐈😃😃🐈\n\nLine 6: 😃🌻😃🌻😃🐈🌷🦍🎋🦐\n\nLine 7: 🐈🐈🎋🦐😃🌻🦍🦐🌻🌻\n\nLine 8: 🌻🦍🐈🎋🐈🌻🐈🎋🌷🌲\n\nLine 9: 🦍🌷🐈🦍🦍🌻🌻🌷🌲🎋\n\nLine 10: 🎋🐈🎋😃😃😃🌲🐈🐈🐈\n\nWait, but the user listed 10 lines. Let me count: yes, the first line (board:) is the header. Then 10 lines of emojis. So rows 0-9.\n\nWait, but the problem says the board is made up of the given lines. So the user provided 10 lines, each with 10 emojis. So 10x10 grid.\n\nSo row 9 is the last line: 🎋🐈🎋😃😃😃🌲🐈🐈🐈.\n\nProcessing row 9:\n\nElements:\n\n0: 🎋\n\n1: 🐈\n\n2: 🎋\n\n3: 😃\n\n4: 😃\n\n5: 😃\n\n6: 🌲\n\n7: 🐈\n\n8: 🐈\n\n9: 🐈\n\nRuns:\n\n🎋 (1) → next 🐈. No.\n\n🐈 (1) → next 🎋. No.\n\n🎋 (1) → next 😃. No.\n\nThen 😃 at 3,4,5: run of 3. So add 1.\n\nThen 🌲 (1) → next 🐈. No.\n\nThen 🐈 at 7,8,9: run of 3. So add 1.\n\nSo row 9 (the last row) has two runs of >=2: the three 😃s and the three 🐈s. So contributes 2.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that rows 0 contributes 2, row1:1, row2:0, row3:0, row4:1, row5:2, row6:0, row7:2, row8:0, row9 (the last line):2. So sum the rows:\n\nRow 0:2\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:2\n\nRow6:0\n\nRow7:2\n\nRow8:0\n\nRow9:2\n\nTotal row contributions: 2+1+0+0+1+2+0+2+0+2= 10.\n\nWait wait, adding 2 (row0) +1 (row1) is 3, then row4 is +1 (4), row5 +2 (6), row7 +2 (8), row9 +2 (10). So rows contribute 10.\n\nNow, processing the columns. Each column is 10 emojis, check vertical runs.\n\nThis part is trickier. Let's take each column from 0 to 9, and process each column's elements vertically.\n\nLet me start with column 0.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow0: 🎋\n\nRow1: 🐈\n\nRow2: 🌲\n\nRow3: 🐈\n\nRow4: 🦐\n\nRow5: 😃\n\nRow6: 🐈\n\nRow7: 🌻\n\nRow8: 🦍\n\nRow9: 🎋\n\nSo the elements are:\n\n🎋, 🐈, 🌲, 🐈, 🦐, 😃, 🐈, 🌻, 🦍, 🎋.\n\nLooking for runs. Each consecutive same emoji vertically.\n\nBut in a column, the elements are in rows 0-9.\n\nSo processing this column:\n\nStart with row 0 (🎋). Next row1 (🐈, different). So no run.\n\nRow1: 🐈. Next row2: 🌲 (diff). No.\n\nRow2: 🌲. Next row3: 🐈 (diff). No.\n\nRow3: 🐈. Next row4: 🦐 (diff). No.\n\nRow4: 🦐. Next row5: 😃 (diff). No.\n\nRow5: 😃. Next row6: 🐈 (diff). No.\n\nRow6: 🐈. Next row7: 🌻 (diff). No.\n\nRow7: 🌻. Next row8: 🦍 (diff). No.\n\nRow8: 🦍. Next row9: 🎋 (diff). So no runs in column0. So 0.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow0: 🌲\n\nRow1: 🦍\n\nRow2: 🦐\n\nRow3: 🌲\n\nRow4: 🌲\n\nRow5: 🌻\n\nRow6: 🐈\n\nRow7: 🦍\n\nRow8: 🌷\n\nRow9: 🐈\n\nElements: 🌲, 🦍, 🦐, 🌲, 🌲, 🌻, 🐈, 🦍, 🌷, 🐈.\n\nCheck for runs:\n\nRow0: 🌲. Row1: 🦍 (diff). So no.\n\nRow1: 🦍. Row2: 🦐 (diff). No.\n\nRow2: 🦐. Row3: 🌲 (diff). No.\n\nRow3: 🌲. Row4: 🌲 (same). So run starts here. Check how long:\n\nRow3: 🌲, row4: 🌲 → count 2. Then row5: 🌻 (diff). So run of 2. Add 1.\n\nThen row5: 🌻. row6: 🐈 (diff). No.\n\nRow6: 🐈. row7: 🦍 (diff). No.\n\nRow7: 🦍. row8: 🌷 (diff). No.\n\nRow8: 🌷. row9: 🐈 (diff). No.\n\nSo column1 contributes 1.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: 🦍\n\nRow1: 🌲\n\nRow2: 🌲\n\nRow3: 🌻\n\nRow4: 🦐\n\nRow5: 😃\n\nRow6: 🎋\n\nRow7: 🐈\n\nRow8: 🐈\n\nRow9: 🎋\n\nElements:\n\nRow0: 🦍\n\nRow1: 🌲\n\nRow2: 🌲\n\nRow3: 🌻\n\nRow4: 🦐\n\nRow5: 😃\n\nRow6: 🎋\n\nRow7: 🐈\n\nRow8: 🐈\n\nRow9: 🎋\n\nCheck runs:\n\nRow0: 🦍. Row1: 🌲 (diff). No.\n\nRow1: 🌲. Row2: 🌲 (same). Run starts here. Count 2. Then row3: 🌻 (diff). So add 1.\n\nRow3: 🌻. Next row4: 🦐 (diff). No.\n\nRow4: 🦐. row5: 😃 (diff). No.\n\nRow5: 😃. row6: 🎋 (diff). No.\n\nRow6: 🎋. row7: 🐈 (diff). No.\n\nRow7: 🐈. row8: 🐈 (same). Run of 2. Add 1.\n\nSo column2 has two runs: rows1-2 (🌲🌲) and rows7-8 (🐈🐈). So contributes 2.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🦍\n\nRow1: 🐈\n\nRow2: 🎋\n\nRow3: 🐈\n\nRow4: 🦍\n\nRow5: 😃\n\nRow6: 🦐\n\nRow7: 🎋\n\nRow8: 🦍\n\nRow9: 😃\n\nElements: 🦍, 🐈, 🎋, 🐈, 🦍, 😃, 🦐, 🎋, 🦍, 😃.\n\nLooking for runs:\n\nRow0: 🦍 → row1: 🐈. Diff. No.\n\nRow1: 🐈 → row2: 🎋. Diff. No.\n\nRow2: 🎋 → row3: 🐈. Diff. No.\n\nRow3: 🐈 → row4: 🦍. Diff. No.\n\nRow4: 🦍 → row5: 😃. Diff. No.\n\nRow5: 😃 → row6: 🦐. Diff. No.\n\nRow6: 🦐 → row7: 🎋. Diff. No.\n\nRow7: 🎋 → row8: 🦍. Diff. No.\n\nRow8: 🦍 → row9: 😃. Diff. No. So column3 contributes 0.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow0: 🐈\n\nRow1: 🌷\n\nRow2: 🌻\n\nRow3: 🦐\n\nRow4: 😃\n\nRow5: 🌷\n\nRow6: 😃\n\nRow7: 🌻\n\nRow8: 🦍\n\nRow9: 😃\n\nElements: 🐈, 🌷, 🌻, 🦐, 😃, 🌷, 😃, 🌻, 🦍, 😃.\n\nAll different in sequence. So no runs. Column4 contributes 0.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow0: 🌲\n\nRow1: 🐈\n\nRow2: 🦐\n\nRow3: 🦍\n\nRow4: 🌷\n\nRow5: 😃\n\nRow6: 🐈\n\nRow7: 🦐\n\nRow8: 🌻\n\nRow9: 😃\n\nElements: 🌲, 🐈, 🦐, 🦍, 🌷, 😃, 🐈, 🦐, 🌻, 😃.\n\nAll consecutive elements are different. So column5 contributes 0.\n\nColumn6:\n\nRow0: 🦐\n\nRow1: 😃\n\nRow2: 😃\n\nRow3: 😃\n\nRow4: 🐈\n\nRow5: 🐈\n\nRow6: 🌷\n\nRow7: 🦍\n\nRow8: 🌷\n\nRow9: 🌲\n\nWait, let's list them:\n\nRow0: 🦐 (6th element?)\n\nWait, column6. Let's reindex columns properly. Each row has 10 emojis. So column numbers are 0-9.\n\nSo for each row, the elements are ordered 0-9. For column6, we look at the 6th index (0-based) of each row.\n\nRow0: 🎋🌲🦍🦍🐈🌲🌲🦐🌷🌲 → positions 0-9. So column6 is 🌲.\n\nRow1: 🐈🦍🌲🐈🌷🐈😃😃🌲🦍 → column6 is 😃.\n\nRow2: 🌲🦐🌲🎋🌻🦐😃🎋🌷🌲 → column6 is 😃.\n\nRow3: 🐈🌲🌻🐈🦐🦍😃🌷🌲🌲 → column6 is 😃.\n\nRow4: 🦐😃😃🌻🌷😃🐈😃😃🐈 → column6 is 🐈.\n\nRow5: 😃🌻😃🌻😃🐈🌷🦍🎋🦐 → column6 is 🌷.\n\nRow6: 🐈🐈🎋🦐😃🌻🦍🦐🌻🌻 → column6 is 🦍.\n\nRow7: 🌻🦍🐈🎋🐈🌻🐈🎋🌷🌲 → column6 is 🐈.\n\nRow8: 🦍🌷🐈🦍🦍🌻🌻🌷🌲🎋 → column6 is 🌻.\n\nRow9: 🎋🐈🎋😃😃😃🌲🐈🐈🐈 → column6 is 🌲.\n\nSo column6 elements are:\n\nRow0: 🌲 (6th emoji)\n\nRow1: 😃\n\nRow2: 😃\n\nRow3: 😃\n\nRow4: 🐈\n\nRow5: 🌷\n\nRow6: 🦍\n\nRow7: 🐈\n\nRow8: 🌻\n\nRow9: 🌲\n\nSo the sequence is: 🌲, 😃, 😃, 😃, 🐈, 🌷, 🦍, 🐈, 🌻, 🌲.\n\nCheck for runs.\n\nStart with row0: 🌲. Next row1: 😃. Different. No.\n\nRows1-3: 😃, 😃, 😃. That's a run of 3. So add 1.\n\nRows4: 🐈. Next row5: 🌷. Different.\n\nRows7: 🐈. Previous row6: 🦍. Different. So run starts at row7: 🐈. Next row8: 🌻. Different. So no.\n\nSo in column6, there is a run from rows1-3 (three 😃s). So contributes 1.\n\nSo column6 adds 1.\n\nColumn7:\n\nLooking at each row's 7th element.\n\nRow0: 🦐 (position7 is index7)\n\nRow1: 😃 (position7)\n\nRow2: 🎋\n\nRow3: 🌷\n\nRow4: 😃\n\nRow5: 🦍\n\nRow6: 🦐\n\nRow7: 🎋\n\nRow8: 🌷\n\nRow9: 🐈\n\nElements:\n\nRow0: 🦐\n\nRow1: 😃\n\nRow2: 🎋\n\nRow3: 🌷\n\nRow4: 😃\n\nRow5: 🦍\n\nRow6: 🦐\n\nRow7: 🎋\n\nRow8: 🌷\n\nRow9: 🐈\n\nNo consecutive same emojis. So contributes 0.\n\nColumn8:\n\nEach row's 8th element.\n\nRow0: 🌷\n\nRow1: 🌲\n\nRow2: 🌷\n\nRow3: 🌲\n\nRow4: 😃\n\nRow5: 🎋\n\nRow6: 🌻\n\nRow7: 🌷\n\nRow8: 🌲\n\nRow9: 🐈\n\nElements: 🌷, 🌲, 🌷, 🌲, 😃, 🎋, 🌻, 🌷, 🌲, 🐈.\n\nNo runs of >=2. So contributes 0.\n\nColumn9:\n\nEach row's 9th element.\n\nRow0: 🌲\n\nRow1: 🦍\n\nRow2: 🌲\n\nRow3: 🌲\n\nRow4: 🐈\n\nRow5: 🦐\n\nRow6: 🌻\n\nRow7: 🌲\n\nRow8: 🎋\n\nRow9: 🐈\n\nElements: 🌲, 🦍, 🌲, 🌲, 🐈, 🦐, 🌻, 🌲, 🎋, 🐈.\n\nCheck for runs:\n\nRow2: 🌲, row3: 🌲 → run of 2. Add 1.\n\nRow7: 🌲. Previous row6: 🌻 (diff). Next row8: 🎋 (diff). No.\n\nSo column9 contributes 1.\n\nNow, let's sum all column contributions:\n\nColumn0:0\n\nColumn1:1\n\nColumn2:2\n\nColumn3:0\n\nColumn4:0\n\nColumn5:0\n\nColumn6:1\n\nColumn7:0\n\nColumn8:0\n\nColumn9:1\n\nTotal columns: 1+2+1+1=5? Wait, let me add:\n\nColumn1:1 → total 1.\n\nColumn2:2 → total 3.\n\nColumn6:1 → total4.\n\nColumn9:1 → total5.\n\nYes, 5.\n\nSo total lines (rows + columns) are 10 (rows) +5 (columns) =15. So the answer is 15.\n\nWait, but wait let me recheck the columns.\n\nOther columns:\n\nFor example, column6 had a run of 3, which counts as 1. Correct.\n\nColumn2 had two runs: the 🌲🌲 and 🐈🐈. So 2.\n\nColumn9: the run is row2 and row3 (🌲 and 🌲). So that's a run of 2. Yes. So column9 contributes 1.\n\nSo columns total 5.\n\nRows: 10.\n\nTotal is 15.\n\nBut wait, I might have made a mistake in counting. Let me double-check some columns.\n\nAnother possible column to check: column7?\n\nColumn7: elements:\n\nRow0: 🦐\n\nRow1: 😃\n\nRow2: 🎋\n\nRow3: 🌷\n\nRow4: 😃\n\nRow5: 🦍\n\nRow6: 🦐\n\nRow7: 🎋\n\nRow8: 🌷\n\nRow9: 🐈\n\nNo runs. So yes, 0.\n\nWhat about column5?\n\nColumn5 elements:\n\nRow0: 🌲\n\nRow1: 🐈\n\nRow2: 🦐\n\nRow3: 🦍\n\nRow4: 🌷\n\nRow5: 😃\n\nRow6: 🐈\n\nRow7: 🦐\n\nRow8: 🌻\n\nRow9: 😃.\n\nNo runs. So 0.\n\nAnother example: column4.\n\nElements:\n\nRow0: 🐈\n\nRow1: 🌷\n\nRow2: 🌻\n\nRow3: 🦐\n\nRow4: 😃\n\nRow5: 🌷\n\nRow6: 😃\n\nRow7: 🌻\n\nRow8: 🦍\n\nRow9: 😃.\n\nNo two same in a row. So 0.\n\nWhat about column8:\n\nElements: 🌷, 🌲, 🌷, 🌲, 😃, 🎋, 🌻, 🌷, 🌲, 🐈. No runs. So 0.\n\nSo columns are 0,1,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,1 → sum is 0+1+2+0+0+0+1+0+0+1=5. Correct.\n\nSo total lines: 10 (rows) +5 (columns) =15.

I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji where the length is 2 or more. The board is a 10x10 grid, right? So each line can be horizontal (same row) or vertical (same column). The lines have to be consecutive same emojis, and their length must be at least 2. But wait, how do overlapping lines count? Like, if there's a sequence of 3 same emojis in a row, that counts as one line of length 3, right? Or does each possible segment count as separate lines? Hmm. The problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more.\" So a sequence of 3 would contribute one line of length 3. Because a line here is the entire consecutive sequence. So each consecutive sequence of the same emoji in a row or column counts once if its length is >=2.\n\nSo the approach is to check every row and column for consecutive sequences. For each row, iterate through each emoji, check if it's the same as the previous, track the current run length. When a run ends (either because the next is different or end of the row), if the run length is >=2, count it as one line. Do the same for each column.\n\nWait, but the problem might be asking for all possible lines. Wait, no. The question says \"the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So each line is a straight line (horizontal or vertical) of consecutive same emojis. So in a row, consecutive same emojis form a horizontal line. For example, in a row like A A A, this would be a single line of length 3. Similarly, in a column, consecutive same emojis form a vertical line.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each row, process each horizontal line. For each row, scan left to right, group consecutive same emojis. Each group of length >=2 contributes 1 to the total count.\n\n2. For each column, process each vertical line. For each column, scan top to bottom, group consecutive same emojis. Each group of length >=2 contributes 1 to the total count.\n\nSum all these counts from rows and columns.\n\nSo now, let's look at the given board. Let me try to process each row first.\n\nThe board is 10 rows, each with 10 emojis. Let me try to go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0: 🌍 🐓 🌘 🌘 🦏 🐧 🐌 🌘 🐫 🐧\n\nLooking for consecutive same emojis.\n\n- 🌍 (1)\n- 🐓 (1)\n- 🌘 🌘 → group of 2 → count 1\n- 🦏 (1)\n- 🐧 (1)\n- 🐌 (1)\n- 🌘 (1)\n- 🐫 (1)\n- 🐧 (1)\nSo in row 0, the first group is the two 🌘, so count +=1. Any others? No. So row 0 contributes 1.\n\nRow 1: 🌍 🐫 🐓 🐫 🐧 🐧 🐓 🐌 🐧 🌲\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\n- 🌍 (1)\n- 🐫 (1)\n- 🐓 (1)\n- 🐫 (1)\n- 🐧 🐧 → group of 2 → count +=1\n- 🐓 (1)\n- 🐌 (1)\n- 🐧 (1)\n- 🌲 (1)\nSo row 1 contributes 1.\n\nRow 2: 🌲 🦏 🌘 🌲 🐧 🦓 🐫 🌘 🐧 🐌\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\n- 🌲 (1)\n- 🦏 (1)\n- 🌘 (1)\n- 🌲 (1)\n- 🐧 (1)\n- 🦓 (1)\n- 🐫 (1)\n- 🌘 (1)\n- 🐧 (1)\n- 🐌 (1)\nNo consecutive groups here. So row 2 contributes 0.\n\nRow 3: 🌍 🌘 🐌 🌍 🐌 🌍 🦓 🐌 🌍 🌘\n\nCheck each:\n\n- 🌍 (1)\n- 🌘 (1)\n- 🐌 (1)\n- 🌍 (1)\n- 🐌 (1)\n- 🌍 (1)\n- 🦓 (1)\n- 🐌 (1)\n- 🌍 (1)\n- 🌘 (1)\nNo consecutive pairs. So row 3 contributes 0.\n\nRow 4: 🐓 🌲 🐧 🐓 🐓 🐧 🐌 🌍 🦏 🌲\n\nCheck:\n\n- 🐓 (1)\n- 🌲 (1)\n- 🐧 (1)\n- 🐓 🐓 → group of 2 → count +=1\n- 🐧 (1)\n- 🐌 (1)\n- 🌍 (1)\n- 🦏 (1)\n- 🌲 (1)\nSo row 4 contributes 1.\n\nRow 5: 🦏 🐓 🐧 🐧 🐧 🐫 🦏 🦏 🐌 🐌\n\nCheck:\n\n- 🦏 (1)\n- 🐓 (1)\n- 🐧 🐧 🐧 → group of 3 → count +=1\n- 🐫 (1)\n- 🦏 🦏 → group of 2 → count +=1\n- 🐌 🐌 → group of 2 → count +=1\nSo in row 5, three groups. So count +=3. So row 5 contributes 3.\n\nRow 6: 🐫 🐌 🌲 🦏 🐌 🌍 🌍 🐌 🌍 🦓\n\nCheck:\n\n- 🐫 (1)\n- 🐌 (1)\n- 🌲 (1)\n- 🦏 (1)\n- 🐌 (1)\n- 🌍 🌍 → group of 2 → count +=1\n- 🐌 (1)\n- 🌍 (1)\n- 🦓 (1)\nSo row 6 contributes 1.\n\nRow 7: 🦏 🦓 🌍 🐓 🦏 🦏 🌲 🦓 🌍 🐧\n\nCheck:\n\n- 🦏 (1)\n- 🦓 (1)\n- 🌍 (1)\n- 🐓 (1)\n- 🦏 🦏 → group of 2 → count +=1\n- 🌲 (1)\n- 🦓 (1)\n- 🌍 (1)\n- 🐧 (1)\nSo row 7 contributes 1.\n\nRow 8: 🐫 🌘 🦓 🌘 🐫 🐓 🦏 🐫 🌲 🐓\n\nCheck:\n\n- 🐫 (1)\n- 🌘 (1)\n- 🦓 (1)\n- 🌘 (1)\n- 🐫 (1)\n- 🐓 (1)\n- 🦏 (1)\n- 🐫 (1)\n- 🌲 (1)\n- 🐓 (1)\nNo consecutive pairs here. So row 8 contributes 0.\n\nRow 9: 🌍 🐧 🦏 🐌 🐌 🌍 🐫 🌘 🌲 🦏\n\nCheck:\n\n- 🌍 (1)\n- 🐧 (1)\n- 🦏 (1)\n- 🐌 🐌 → group of 2 → count +=1\n- 🌍 (1)\n- 🐫 (1)\n- 🌘 (1)\n- 🌲 (1)\n- 🦏 (1)\nSo row 9 contributes 1.\n\nTotal rows: 1+1+0+0+1+3+1+1+0+1 = 9 (rows contributing: rows 0,1,4,5,6,7,9; sum their contributions: 1+1+1+3+1+1+1 = 9? Wait, wait:\n\nRow 0: 1\nRow 1: 1 → total 2\nRow4:1 →3\nRow5:3 →6\nRow6:1 →7\nRow7:1 →8\nRow9:1 →9. Yes. So rows contribute 9.\n\nNow columns. Processing each column.\n\nEach column has 10 rows. For each column, scan from top to bottom, looking for consecutive same emojis. Each group of >=2 contributes 1.\n\nLet's list the columns. Each column is 10 emojis. Let's process each column from 0 to 9.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow0: 🌍\nRow1: 🌍\nRow2: 🌲\nRow3: 🌍\nRow4: 🐓\nRow5: 🦏\nRow6: 🐫\nRow7: 🦏\nRow8: 🐫\nRow9: 🌍\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\nRow0 and row1 are 🌍 and 🌍: consecutive. So group of 2 → count +=1.\nThen row2 is 🌲 (different), so group ends. Then row3 is 🌍 (different). Then row4 is 🐓 (different). Then row5 🦏 (different). row6 🐫, row7 🦏, etc. So column0 has a group of 2 (🌍🌍) → count 1.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow0: 🐓\nRow1: 🐫\nRow2: 🦏\nRow3: 🌘\nRow4: 🌲\nRow5: 🐓\nRow6: 🐌\nRow7: 🦓\nRow8: 🌘\nRow9: 🐧\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\nRow0: 🐓 (1)\nRow1: 🐫 (diff). So no.\nRow2: 🦏 (diff)\nRow3: 🌘 (diff)\nRow4: 🌲 (diff)\nRow5: 🐓 (diff)\nRow6: 🐌 (diff)\nRow7: 🦓 (diff)\nRow8: 🌘 (diff)\nRow9: 🐧 (diff)\nNo groups. So column1 contributes 0.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: 🌘\nRow1: 🐓\nRow2: 🌘\nRow3: 🐌\nRow4: 🐧\nRow5: 🐧\nRow6: 🌲\nRow7: 🌍\nRow8: 🦓\nRow9: 🦏\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\nRow0: 🌘 (1)\nRow1: 🐓 (diff)\nRow2: 🌘 (diff)\nRow3: 🐌 (diff)\nRow4: 🐧 (diff)\nRow5: 🐧 → same as row4? No. row4 is 🐧, row5 is row5 of column2? Wait, column2 for row5 is row5, column2. Let's see:\n\nWait, each column is the same index across all rows. So for column2, the emojis are:\n\nRow0: 🌘 (index 2)\nRow1: 🐓 (index 2)\nRow2: 🌘 (index 2)\nRow3: 🐌 (index2)\nRow4: 🐧 (index2)\nRow5: 🐧 (row5's column2 is third emoji. Let's check the fifth row (row5's data is 🦏🐓🐧🐧🐧🐫🦏🦏🐌🐌. So index2 is 🐧. So row5's column2 is 🐧. So row4 and row5 column2 are both 🐧.\n\nSo column2:\n\nRow0: 🌘\n\nRow1: 🐓 (diff)\n\nRow2: 🌘 (diff)\n\nRow3: 🐌 (diff)\n\nRow4: 🐧\n\nRow5: 🐧 → same as row4. So group starts at row4. So row4 and row5: group of 2 → count +=1.\n\nRow6: 🌲 (diff)\n\nRow7: 🌍 (diff)\n\nRow8: 🦓 (diff)\n\nRow9: 🦏 (diff)\n\nSo column2 contributes 1.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🌘 (index3)\nRow1: 🐫 (row1 index3 is fourth emoji? Let's check:\n\nRow1: 🌍🐫🐓🐫🐧🐧🐓🐌🐧🌲. So the indexes are 0:🌍,1:🐫,2:🐓,3:🐫, etc. So row1 index3 is 🐫.\n\nRow2 index3: row2's third emoji (row2 is 🌲🦏🌘🌲🐧🦓🐫🌘🐧🐌 → index3 is 🌲.\n\nRow3 index3: row3 is 🌍🌘🐌🌍🐌🌍🦓🐌🌍🌘 → index3 is 🌍.\n\nRow4 index3: row4's third emoji is 🐓. Because row4: 🐓🌲🐧🐓🐓🐧🐌🌍🦏🌲 → indexes 0-9: 0:🐓,1:🌲,2:🐧,3:🐓, etc. So index3 is 🐓.\n\nRow5 index3: row5 is 🦏🐓🐧🐧🐧🐫🦏🦏🐌🐌 → index3 is 🐧.\n\nRow6 index3: row6's third emoji is 🌲. row6: 🐫🐌🌲🦏🐌🌍🌍🐌🌍🦓 → index3 is 🦏.\n\nRow7 index3: 🐓. Because row7 is 🦏🦓🌍🐓🦏🦏🌲🦓🌍🐧 → index3 is 🐓.\n\nRow8 index3: 🌘. row8: 🐫🌘🦓🌘🐫🐓🦏🐫🌲🐓 → index3 is 🌘.\n\nRow9 index3: 🐌. row9: 🌍🐧🦏🐌🐌🌍🐫🌘🌲🦏 → index3 is 🐌.\n\nSo column3's data:\n\nRow0: 🌘\nRow1: 🐫\nRow2: 🌲\nRow3: 🌍\nRow4: 🐓\nRow5: 🐧\nRow6: 🦏\nRow7: 🐓\nRow8: 🌘\nRow9: 🐌\n\nLooking for consecutive same:\n\nLooking from top to bottom.\n\nRow0: 🌘 (1)\nRow1: 🐫 (diff)\nRow2: 🌲 (diff)\nRow3: 🌍 (diff)\nRow4: 🐓 (diff)\nRow5: 🐧 (diff)\nRow6: 🦏 (diff)\nRow7: 🐓 (diff)\nRow8: 🌘 (diff)\nRow9: 🐌 (diff)\nNo consecutive pairs. So column3 contributes 0.\n\nColumn4:\n\nCheck each row's 4th index (index4).\n\nRow0: 🦏 (index4)\nRow1: 🐧 (row1's index4 is 🐧)\nRow2: 🐧 (row2's index4 is 🐧)\nRow3: 🐌 (row3's index4 is 🐌)\nRow4: 🐓 (row4's index4 is 🐓)\nRow5: 🐧 (row5's index4 is 🐧)\nRow6: 🐌 (row6's index4 is 🐌)\nRow7: 🦏 (row7's index4 is 🦏)\nRow8: 🐫 (row8's index4 is 🐫)\nRow9: 🐌 (row9's index4 is 🐌)\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\nRow0: 🦏 (1)\nRow1: 🐧 (diff)\nRow2: 🐧 (diff? Row2's index4 is 🐧, but row1's is 🐧. Wait, row1's index4 is 🐧, row2's index4 is 🐧. So row1 and row2 in column4:\n\nRow1 index4: 🐧 (row1: 🌍🐫🐓🐫🐧🐧🐓🐌🐧🌲 → indices 0-9. So index4 is 🐧. row2's data is 🌲🦏🌘🌲🐧🦓🐫🌘🐧🐌 → index4 is 🐧. So row1 and row2 both have 🐧 in column4. So consecutive.\n\nWait, but column4 has row0: 🦏, row1: 🐧, row2: 🐧. So from row1 to row2: same.\n\nSo let's process column4:\n\nRow0: 🦏 → count 1.\n\nRow1: 🐧 → start a new group. current group length 1.\n\nRow2: 🐧 → same as previous. current group length 2. So when this group ends (since next is row3's 🐌), then group length 2 → count +=1.\n\nRow3: 🐌 → new group. length 1.\n\nRow4: 🐓 → new group. length 1.\n\nRow5: 🐧 → new group. length 1.\n\nRow6: 🐌 → new group. length 1.\n\nRow7: 🦏 → new group. length 1.\n\nRow8: 🐫 → new group. length 1.\n\nRow9: 🐌 → new group. length 1.\n\nSo column4 has one group (rows1-2) of 🐧, length 2 → count +=1.\n\nSo column4 contributes 1.\n\nColumn5:\n\nCheck each row's index5.\n\nRow0: 🐧 (index5)\nRow1: 🐧 (row1's index5 is 🐧)\nRow2: 🦓 (row2's index5 is 🦓)\nRow3: 🌍 (row3's index5 is 🌍)\nRow4: 🐧 (row4's index5 is 🐧)\nRow5: 🐫 (row5's index5 is 🐫)\nRow6: 🌍 (row6's index5 is 🌍)\nRow7: 🦏 (row7's index5 is 🦏)\nRow8: 🐓 (row8's index5 is 🐓)\nRow9: 🌍 (row9's index5 is 🌍)\n\nLooking for consecutive same.\n\nRow0: 🐧 (1)\nRow1: 🐧 → same. group length 2. So this group is from row0 to row1. Then row2 is 🦓 (diff). So group ends. count +=1.\n\nThen row3: 🌍 (1)\nRow4: 🐧 (diff)\nRow5: 🐫 (diff)\nRow6: 🌍 → same as row3? No, row3 is row3's index5. So row3 is 🌍, row4's index5 is 🐧 (diff). Then row5's is 🐫, row6's is 🌍 (diff). So row3 is a single.\n\nCheck other possible groups.\n\nSo column5's groups:\n\nrow0-1: 🐧🐧 → count 1.\n\nAny others? Row3-6: no. So column5 contributes 1.\n\nColumn6:\n\nCheck index6 for each row.\n\nRow0: 🐌\nRow1: 🐓\nRow2: 🐫\nRow3: 🦓\nRow4: 🐌\nRow5: 🦏\nRow6: 🐌\nRow7: 🌲\nRow8: 🦏\nRow9: 🐫\n\nLooking for consecutive same.\n\nRow0: 🐌 (1)\nRow1: 🐓 (diff)\nRow2: 🐫 (diff)\nRow3: 🦓 (diff)\nRow4: 🐌 (diff)\nRow5: 🦏 (diff)\nRow6: 🐌 (diff)\nRow7: 🌲 (diff)\nRow8: 🦏 (diff)\nRow9: 🐫 (diff)\nNo groups. So column6 contributes 0.\n\nColumn7:\n\nCheck index7 for each row.\n\nRow0: 🌘\nRow1: 🐌\nRow2: 🌘\nRow3: 🐌\nRow4: 🌍\nRow5: 🦏\nRow6: 🐌\nRow7: 🦓\nRow8: 🐫\nRow9: 🌘\n\nProcessing:\n\nRow0: 🌘 (1)\nRow1: 🐌 (diff)\nRow2: 🌘 → same as row0? No, it's row2's index7. So row2's index7 is 🌘 (from row2 data: 🌲🦏🌘🌲🐧🦓🐫🌘🐧🐌 → index7 is 🌘.\n\nSo:\n\nrow0: 🌘\n\nrow1: 🐌 (diff)\n\nrow2: 🌘 (diff from row1. So new group. So row2's group starts here.\n\nrow3: 🐌 (diff)\n\nrow4: 🌍 (diff)\n\nrow5: 🦏 (diff)\n\nrow6: 🐌 (diff)\n\nrow7: 🦓 (diff)\n\nrow8: 🐫 (diff)\n\nrow9: 🌘 (diff from previous row8's 🐫. So row9's 🌘 is new.\n\nSo no consecutive groups in column7. So column7 contributes 0.\n\nColumn8:\n\nCheck index8 for each row.\n\nRow0: 🐫\nRow1: 🐧\nRow2: 🐧\nRow3: 🌍\nRow4: 🦏\nRow5: 🐌\nRow6: 🌍\nRow7: 🌍\nRow8: 🌲\nRow9: 🌲\n\nLooking for consecutive same.\n\nRow0: 🐫 (1)\nRow1: 🐧 (diff)\nRow2: 🐧 (diff)\nRow3: 🌍 (diff)\nRow4: 🦏 (diff)\nRow5: 🐌 (diff)\nRow6: 🌍 (diff)\nRow7: 🌍 → same as row6. So row6's index8 is 🌍, row7's is 🌍. So group of 2 → count +=1.\n\nThen row8: 🌲 (diff)\nRow9: 🌲 → same as row8. So group of 2 → count +=1.\n\nWait, let's process step by step.\n\nProcessing column8:\n\nRow0: 🐫 (current emoji, start group at 0, length 1)\nRow1: 🐧 (diff → group ends. length 1, no count)\nRow2: 🐧 (diff → new group, but same as previous? No, new group. length 1)\nRow3: 🌍 (diff)\nRow4: 🦏 (diff)\nRow5: 🐌 (diff)\nRow6: 🌍 → new group (length 1)\nRow7: 🌍 → same as row6. So group starts at row6, length 2 → count +=1.\nRow8: 🌲 → new group (diff → group ends. new group starts. length 1)\nRow9: 🌲 → same as row8. group length 2 → count +=1.\n\nSo column8 has two groups: rows6-7 (🌍🌍) and rows8-9 (🌲🌲). So count +=2.\n\nSo column8 contributes 2.\n\nColumn9:\n\nCheck index9 for each row.\n\nRow0: 🐧\nRow1: 🌲\nRow2: 🐌\nRow3: 🌘\nRow4: 🌲\nRow5: 🐌\nRow6: 🦓\nRow7: 🐧\nRow8: 🐓\nRow9: 🦏\n\nProcessing consecutive:\n\nRow0: 🐧 (1)\nRow1: 🌲 (diff)\nRow2: 🐌 (diff)\nRow3: 🌘 (diff)\nRow4: 🌲 → same as row1? No, row4's index9 is 🌲. Previous was row3's 🌘 (diff). So new group. length 1.\nRow5: 🐌 (diff)\nRow6: 🦓 (diff)\nRow7: 🐧 (diff)\nRow8: 🐓 (diff)\nRow9: 🦏 (diff)\nNo consecutive pairs. So column9 contributes 0.\n\nNow summing all columns:\n\ncolumns 0:1, 1:0, 2:1, 3:0,4:1,5:1,6:0,7:0,8:2,9:0 → total columns contribute 1+0+1+0+1+1+0+0+2+0=6.\n\nSo total rows contributed 9, columns 6. Total answer is 9+6=15.\n\nWait, but let me check again:\n\nRows: 9 (from earlier count), columns: 1 (column0) +1 (column2) +1 (column4) +1 (column5) +2 (column8) → 1+1=2 for column0 and 2? Wait:\n\nColumn0: 1\nColumn2:1\nColumn4:1\nColumn5:1\nColumn8:2\nTotal: 1+1+1+1+2 =6.\n\nYes. So rows 9, columns 6. Sum 15.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in column5.\n\nColumn5 processing:\n\nEach row's index5.\n\nRow0: 🐧 (row0's index5 is 🐧. row0's data: 🌍🐓🌘🌘🦏🐧🐌🌘🐫🐧 → index5 is 🐧.\n\nRow1: index5 is 🐧 (row1: index5 is 🐧)\n\nRow2: index5 is 🦓.\n\nSo rows0 and 1 of column5 are 🐧 and 🐧 → group of 2. That's correct. So column5 contributes 1.\n\nSo the columns sum to 6.\n\nSo total is 15. But wait, let's double-check some of the rows and columns again.\n\nLooking back at row5:\n\nIt's 🦏🐓🐧🐧🐧🐫🦏🦏🐌🐌. So the row is:\n\nindexes 0: 🦏, 1: 🐓, 2: 🐧, 3: 🐧,4:🐧,5:🐫,6:🦏,7:🦏,8:🐌,9:🐌.\n\nSo groups here are:\n\n- 🦏 (1)\n- 🐓 (1)\n- 🐧🐧🐧 → count +=1\n- 🐫 (1)\n- 🦏🦏 → count +=1\n- 🐌🐌 → count +=1\nSo row5 contributes 3.

Correct.\n\nColumn8:\n\nRow6's index8 is 🌍 (row6's data: indexes 0-9 are 🐫,🐌,🌲,🦏,🐌,🌍,🌍,🐌,🌍,🦓 → index8 is 🌍.\n\nRow7's index8 is 🌍 (row7's data: 🦏🦓🌍🐓🦏🦏🌲🦓🌍🐧 → index8 is 🌍.\n\nSo row6 and row7's column8 are both 🌍 → group of 2 → count +=1.\n\nThen row8's index8 is 🌲 (row8's data: 🐫🌘🦓🌘🐫🐓🦏🐫🌲🐓 → index8 is 🌲.\n\nRow9's index8 is 🌲 (row9's data: 🌍🐧🦏🐌🐌🌍🐫🌘🌲🦏 → index8 is 🌲.\n\nSo row8 and row9's column8 are 🌲 and 🌲 → group of 2 → count +=1. So column8 contributes 2. Correct.\n\nSo total columns 6, rows 9. 15.\n\nBut wait, let's recheck the columns again.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: 🌘\nRow1: 🐓 (different)\nRow2: 🌘 (different)\nRow3: 🐌 (different)\nRow4: 🐧\nRow5: 🐧 (same as row4, so group of 2 → count +=1.

Hmm, the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more. So each such line contributes to the count. Wait, but lines can be longer than 2, right? Like, a line of 3 would contribute once, not twice? Because the problem says lines with length of 2 or more. So, for example, a horizontal sequence of three same emojis counts as one line. But wait, maybe overlapping lines are considered? No, I think each contiguous segment of the same emoji in a row or column is considered as a single line. So for example, in a row like 🐏🐏🐏, that's a horizontal line of length 3, which counts as one. Similarly, if there's a vertical sequence of three same emojis in a column, that's one vertical line. \n\nSo the plan is to check each row for horizontal sequences and each column for vertical sequences. For each row, scan through and count each contiguous block of the same emoji that's length 2 or more. Do the same for each column. Then sum all those counts.\n\nLet me visualize the given board. Let's represent each emoji with a letter for easier tracking. But maybe better to look at each row and column step by step.\n\nThe board is 6 rows and 6 columns. Let's write them out:\n\nRow 1: 🐣 🐏 🐏 🐣 🐏 🎋\nRow 2: 🐏 🎋 🐣 🎋 🐜 🎋\nRow 3: 🐡 🐣 🐣 🐣 🐣 🐣\nRow 4: 🎋 🐡 🐡 🐣 🐏 🐣\nRow 5: 🎋 🎋 🐜 🎋 🐏 🐣\nRow 6: 🐏 🐡 🎋 🐡 🐡 🐡\n\nFirst, process each row for horizontal lines.\n\nRow 1: 🐣, then two 🐏, then 🐣, then 🐏, then 🎋. So the two 🐏 form a line of 2. Then the single 🐏 at position 4 (after the two 🐏) is a separate occurrence. Wait no, the positions are 1: 🐣, 2-3: 🐏🐏 (length 2), then 4: 🐣, 5: 🐏 (length 1), 6: 🎋. So in row 1, the only horizontal line is the two 🐏. So that's 1.\n\nRow 2: 🐏, 🎋, 🐣, 🎋, 🐜, 🎋. Each emoji is different from the next except maybe between some. Let's check:\n\nPositions 1: 🐏, 2: 🎋 (different). 2: 🎋, 3: 🐣 (different). 3: 🐣, 4: 🎋. 4: 🎋, 5: 🐜. 5: 🐜, 6: 🎋. So all are single. So no horizontal lines here. So row 2 contributes 0.\n\nRow 3: 🐡, followed by five 🐣. So the first emoji is 🐡, then the next five are 🐣. So the sequence starts with 🐡 (length 1), then 🐣🐣🐣🐣🐣 (length 5). So that's a horizontal line of 5, which counts as 1. So row 3 contributes 1.\n\nRow 4: 🎋, then two 🐡, then 🐣, 🐏, 🐣. Let's see:\n\nPosition 1: 🎋. Position 2: 🐡. Position 3: 🐡. So positions 2-3 are two 🐡, length 2. Then 4: 🐣, 5: 🐏, 6: 🐣. So the two 🐡 form a horizontal line. So row 4 contributes 1.\n\nRow 5: 🎋 🎋 🐜 🎋 🐏 🐣. First two are 🎋🎋 (length 2), so that's a horizontal line. Then 🐜, 🎋, 🐏, 🐣. So row 5 contributes 1 for the two 🎋.\n\nRow 6: 🐏 🐡 🎋 🐡 🐡 🐡. Let's check:\n\n1: 🐏 (different from next). 2: 🐡 (different from next 🎋). 3: 🎋 (diff from next 🐡). Then positions 4-6: 🐡🐡🐡 (length 3). So that's a horizontal line. So row 6 contributes 1.\n\nSo for horizontal lines, rows contribute 1+0+1+1+1+1 = 5. \n\nNow check columns for vertical lines. Each column has 6 rows. Let's go through each column.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow1: 🐣\nRow2: 🐏\nRow3: 🐡\nRow4: 🎋\nRow5: 🎋\nRow6: 🐏\n\nAll different. So no vertical line here.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow1: 🐏\nRow2: 🎋\nRow3: 🐣\nRow4: 🐡\nRow5: 🎋\nRow6: 🐡\n\nNo two same in a row. So no vertical line.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow1: 🐏\nRow2: 🐣\nRow3: 🐣\nRow4: 🐡\nRow5: 🐜\nRow6: 🎋\n\nCheck sequences. \n\nRow1: 🐏. Row2: 🐣 (different). So no. Row3: 🐣 (same as row2? No, row3, column3 is 🐣. Wait, column3 is:\n\nRow1: column3 is third emoji. Let me recheck.\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow 1: 🐣 🐏 🐏 🐣 🐏 🎋 → column3 is 🐏.\n\nRow 2: 🐏 🎋 🐣 🎋 🐜 🎋 → column3 is 🐣.\n\nRow3: 🐡 🐣 🐣 🐣 🐣 🐣 → column3 is 🐣.\n\nRow4: 🎋 🐡 🐡 🐣 🐏 🐣 → column3 is 🐡.\n\nRow5: 🎋 🎋 🐜 🎋 🐏 🐣 → column3 is 🐜.\n\nRow6: 🐏 🐡 🎋 🐡 🐡 🐡 → column3 is 🎋.\n\nSo column3:\n\nRow1: 🐏 (column3)\nRow2: 🐣\nRow3: 🐣\nRow4: 🐡\nRow5: 🐜\nRow6: 🎋\n\nLooking for contiguous same emojis vertically. From row1 to row2: 🐏 vs 🐣: different. Row2 to row3: 🐣 and 🐣 → same. So rows2-3 (length 2). Then row4 is different. So in column3, there's a vertical line of length 2 (rows2-3). So that counts as 1 vertical line.\n\nSo column3 contributes 1.\n\nColumn4:\n\nLet's list each row's column4.\n\nRow1: 🐣 (column4 is position4)\nRow2: 🎋 (column4)\nRow3: 🐣 (column4)\nRow4: 🐣 (column4)\nRow5: 🎋 (column4)\nRow6: 🐡 (column4)\n\nSo column4:\n\nRow1: 🐣\nRow2: 🎋\nRow3: 🐣\nRow4: 🐣\nRow5: 🎋\nRow6: 🐡\n\nLooking for consecutive same. Row1: 🐣, next is row2 🎋 (different). Row3: 🐣, row4: 🐣 → same (rows3-4: length 2). Then row5 is 🎋 (different). So that's another vertical line here. So column4 contributes 1.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow1: 🐏 (column5)\nRow2: 🐜 (column5)\nRow3: 🐣 (column5)\nRow4: 🐏 (column5)\nRow5: 🐏 (column5)\nRow6: 🐡 (column5)\n\nCheck for vertical sequences.\n\nRow1: 🐏, row2: 🐜 (different). Row3: 🐣. Row4: 🐏, row5: 🐏 (rows4-5: 🐏🐏, length 2). So that's a vertical line here. So column5 contributes 1.\n\nRow6's column5 is 🐡, different.\n\nSo column5 has one vertical line (rows4-5).\n\nColumn6:\n\nRow1: 🎋\nRow2: 🎋\nRow3: 🐣\nRow4: 🐣\nRow5: 🐣\nRow6: 🐡\n\nLooking for same consecutive.\n\nRow1 and row2: 🎋 and 🎋 → length 2 (vertical line here). Then row3 is 🐣 (different). So column6's first two rows are a vertical line. Then rows3-5: 🐣, 🐣, 🐣 → that's a vertical line of length 3. So column6 has two vertical lines: one from rows1-2 (🎋🎋), and another from rows3-5 (🐣🐣🐣). Wait, but how does that work? Because for vertical lines, each contiguous same in a column is considered as a single line. So in column6:\n\nRow1: 🎋, row2: 🎋 (length 2 → count 1). Then row3: 🐣 (different), then rows3-5: three 🐣 (length 3 → count 1). So column6 contributes 2 vertical lines.\n\nSo columns:\n\nColumn1: 0\n\nColumn2: 0\n\nColumn3: 1\n\nColumn4: 1\n\nColumn5: 1\n\nColumn6: 2\n\nSo total vertical lines are 1+1+1+2 = 5? Wait adding all columns:\n\nColumn3: 1\n\nColumn4: 1\n\nColumn5: 1\n\nColumn6: 2\n\nSo 1+1+1+2 =5. Also columns 1 and 2: 0 each. So total vertical lines are 1+0 +1 (column3) +1 (column4) +1 (column5) +2 (column6) → total 5?\n\nWait, columns 3,4,5,6 contribute 1+1+1+2=5. Columns 1 and 2 contribute 0. So vertical lines total 5?\n\nWait column3 contributes 1. Column4:1. Column5:1. Column6:2. So sum is 5. So vertical lines sum to 5.\n\nThen overall sum is horizontal lines (5) + vertical lines (5) → total 10?\n\nWait wait, let me recount:\n\nIn the horizontal lines, rows 1-6 contributed 1,0,1,1,1,1 → sum 5.\n\nVertical lines: columns 3 (1),4 (1),5 (1),6 (2) → sum 5 (columns 3:1,4:1,5:1,6:2 → 1+1=2, 1+2=3 → 1+1+1+2=5). So vertical lines are 5.\n\nSo total lines: 5+5=10.\n\nBut wait, I need to recheck each column again to avoid mistakes.\n\nLet me go through each column again in detail.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow1: 🐣\n\nRow2: 🐏\n\nRow3: 🐡\n\nRow4: 🎋\n\nRow5: 🎋\n\nRow6: 🐏\n\nNo consecutive same. So 0.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow1: 🐏\n\nRow2: 🎋\n\nRow3: 🐣\n\nRow4: 🐡\n\nRow5: 🎋\n\nRow6: 🐡\n\nCheck each consecutive pair. Row1-2: different. Row2-3: different. Row3-4: different. Row4-5: 🐡 vs 🎋: different. Row5-6: 🎋 vs 🐡: different. So no vertical lines here. 0.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow1: 🐏\n\nRow2: 🐣\n\nRow3: 🐣\n\nRow4: 🐡\n\nRow5: 🐜\n\nRow6: 🎋\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\nRow1 to row2: different. Row2 to row3: same (🐣 → length 2. So that's a vertical line. Row3 to row4: different. Row4 to row5: different. Row5 to row6: different. So only one vertical line here (rows2-3). So column3:1.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow1: 🐣\n\nRow2: 🎋\n\nRow3: 🐣\n\nRow4: 🐣\n\nRow5: 🎋\n\nRow6: 🐡\n\nConsecutive:\n\nRow1-2: 🐣 vs 🎋 → different. Row2-3: 🎋 vs 🐣 → different. Row3-4: 🐣 vs 🐣 → same. Then row4-5: 🐣 vs 🎋 → different. So the vertical line here is rows3-4: length 2. So column4:1.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow1: 🐏\n\nRow2: 🐜\n\nRow3: 🐣\n\nRow4: 🐏\n\nRow5: 🐏\n\nRow6: 🐡\n\nConsecutive pairs:\n\nRow1-2: different. Row2-3: different. Row3-4: different. Row4-5: 🐏 and 🐏 → same (length 2). So vertical line rows4-5. So column5:1.\n\nColumn6:\n\nRow1: 🎋\n\nRow2: 🎋\n\nRow3: 🐣\n\nRow4: 🐣\n\nRow5: 🐣\n\nRow6: 🐡\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\nRow1-2: same (🎋🎋 → length 2 → vertical line). Then row2-3: different. row3-4: 🐣 and 🐣 → same. row4-5: 🐣 and 🐣 → same. So rows3-4-5: three same → vertical line of length 3. So in column6, there are two vertical lines: one at rows1-2 (counted as 1) and another at rows3-5 (counted as 1). So column6 contributes 2. So total vertical lines in columns: 1 (column3) +1 (4) +1 (5) +2 (6) =5.\n\nSo vertical lines total 5.\n\nSo horizontal lines 5, vertical lines 5. Total 10.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. For example, in row3, the entire row after the first 🐡 is five 🐣s. That's a single horizontal line of length 5. So counts as 1. Correct.\n\nRow6's last three 🐡s (positions4-6) → that's a horizontal line of 3 → counts as 1.\n\nAnother example: column6's rows3-5 are three 🐣s, which is a vertical line of 3 → counts as 1. So column6 has two vertical lines: the first two 🎋 and the three 🐣s. So two lines here. So column6 contributes 2.\n\nSo adding that, vertical lines sum to 5.\n\nTherefore, the total is 5+5=10. So the answer is 10?\n\n\nAnswer: 10"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The lines must be of length 2 or more. Let me think step by step how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the board. The input is a 5x5 grid. Let's look at each row:\n\nRow 1: 🐤, 🎁, 🌍, 🌍, 🐤\nRow 2: 🌍, 🐤, 🎁, 🐤, 🌍\nRow 3: 🎁, 🌍, 🌍, 🌍, 🌍\nRow 4: 🎁, 🌍, 🌍, 🎁, 🐤\nRow 5: 🐤, 🎁, 🎁, 🎁, 🎁\n\nHmm. So each row has 5 emojis, and there are 5 rows. I need to check all possible horizontal lines (rows) and vertical lines (columns) for consecutive same emojis of length >=2.\n\nWait, but a line here might refer to sequences. For example, in a row, consecutive same emojis form a line. But the problem says lines formed by the same emoji. So a line can be a horizontal or vertical sequence of two or more same emojis. Each such sequence contributes to the count. Also, overlapping sequences might be counted if they are part of longer sequences. Wait, but the question says 'lines formed by the same emoji with length of 2 or more.' So for example, a horizontal line of 3 same emojis would count as two lines (the first two and the last two?), or as one line of length 3, which counts once? Wait, the problem statement is a bit ambiguous here. But from the examples I've seen before, usually, each maximal consecutive sequence is considered as one line. But let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says, \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So each such line is a single consecutive sequence. So for a sequence of 3 same emojis in a row, that's one line of length 3, which counts once. Similarly, a sequence of 4 would count once. So the count is based on the number of such sequences, not the number of possible 2-length segments.\n\nSo the approach is: for each row, check each horizontal run of same emojis. For each run that has length >=2, add 1 to the total. Then, do the same for each column, checking vertical runs.\n\nSo first, process all rows (horizontal lines), then process all columns (vertical lines).\n\nLet me start with the horizontal lines.\n\nLooking at row 1: 🐤, 🎁, 🌍, 🌍, 🐤. Let's split into runs.\n\n- First element is 🐤 (count 1). Next is 🎁, different, so run ends. So run length 1, no count.\n- Then 🎁 (count 1). Next is 🌍, different. Run ends. No count.\n- Then two 🌍s: count 2. So that's a run of 2. So +1.\n- Then 🐤 again, count 1. So for row 1, there's 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow 2: 🌍, 🐤, 🎁, 🐤, 🌍. Each emoji alternates. So all runs are length 1. No contribution here.\n\nRow 3: 🎁, 🌍, 🌍, 🌍, 🌍. So first element 🎁 (1), then 🌍s. Let's see: the first emoji is 🎁 (1 run), then the next four are 🌍. So the run is length 4. Since 4 >=2, add 1. So row 3 contributes 1.\n\nRow 4: 🎁, 🌍, 🌍, 🎁, 🐤. Let's break it down.\n\n- 🎁 (1) then 🌍 (different). Run of 1.\n- Then 🌍s: two in a row. So run length 2. Add 1.\n- Then 🎁 (1), then 🐤 (1). So row 4 has 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow 5: 🐤, 🎁, 🎁, 🎁, 🎁. The first is 🐤 (1). Then four 🎁s. Run length 4. Add 1. So row 5 contributes 1.\n\nSo total horizontal lines: 1 (row1) + 0 (row2) +1 (row3) +1 (row4) +1 (row5) = 4 horizontal lines.\n\nNow process the vertical columns. There are 5 columns. For each column, check vertical runs.\n\nColumn 1: elements from row 1 to 5: 🐤, 🌍, 🎁, 🎁, 🐤. Let's look at consecutive same emojis.\n\nRow1: 🐤\nRow2: 🌍 → different from row1. So run ends. Next is row2: 🌍 (new run, count 1)\nRow3: 🎁 → different. So run ends (count 1, no).\nRow4: 🎁 → same as row3. Wait, column1 for row4 is 🎁? Let me check the board again.\n\nWait, column 1:\n\nRow1: 🐤 (column1)\nRow2: 🌍 (column1)\nRow3: 🎁 (column1)\nRow4: 🎁 (column1)\nRow5: 🐤 (column1)\n\nSo the vertical column1 is [🐤, 🌍, 🎁, 🎁, 🐤]. Let's see the runs:\n\nLooking for consecutive same emojis in the vertical direction.\n\n- Row1: 🐤 → run starts, count 1.\n- Row2: 🌍 → different. So run of 1. No count.\n- Row2: 🌍 → new run, count 1. No count.\n- Row3: 🎁 → different. Run of 1. No.\n- Row3: 🎁 → new run, count 1. Row4: 🎁 → same. So count 2. So run length 2. So add 1.\n- Then row5: 🐤 → different. So column1 has one vertical line (the two 🎁s in row3 and 4).\n\nSo column1 contributes 1.\n\nColumn2: Let's check each element vertically.\n\nColumn2 has:\n\nRow1: 🎁\nRow2: 🐤\nRow3: 🌍\nRow4: 🌍\nRow5: 🎁\n\nSo the sequence is 🎁, 🐤, 🌍, 🌍, 🎁.\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- Row1: 🎁 (count 1).\n- Row2: 🐤 → different. Run ends. No count.\n- Row2: 🐤 (count 1).\n- Row3: 🌍 → different. Run ends. No count.\n- Row3: 🌍 (count 1). Row4: same → count 2. Add 1.\n- Row5: 🎁 → different. So column2 contributes 1.\n\nSo column2 adds 1.\n\nColumn3:\n\nElements in column3:\n\nRow1: 🌍\nRow2: 🎁\nRow3: 🌍\nRow4: 🌍\nRow5: 🎁\n\nSo the sequence is 🌍, 🎁, 🌍, 🌍, 🎁.\n\nLooking for vertical runs:\n\n- Row1: 🌍 (count1). Row2: 🎁 → different. So run ends. No count.\n- Row2: 🎁 (count1). Row3: 🌍 → different. No.\n- Row3: 🌍 (count1). Row4: same → count2 → add 1.\n- Row5: 🎁 → different. So column3 contributes 1.\n\nSo column3 has one vertical line.\n\nColumn4:\n\nElements in column4:\n\nRow1: 🌍\nRow2: 🐤\nRow3: 🌍\nRow4: 🎁\nRow5: 🎁\n\nSo the sequence is 🌍, 🐤, 🌍, 🎁, 🎁.\n\nVertical runs:\n\n- Row1: 🌍 (count1). Row2: 🐤 → different. No count.\n- Row2: 🐤 (count1). Row3: 🌍 → different. No.\n- Row3: 🌍 (count1). Row4: 🎁 → different. No.\n- Row4: 🎁 (count1). Row5: same → count2. Add 1. So column4 contributes 1.\n\nColumn4 adds 1.\n\nColumn5:\n\nElements in column5:\n\nRow1: 🐤\nRow2: 🌍\nRow3: 🌍\nRow4: 🐤\nRow5: 🎁\n\nSequence: 🐤, 🌍, 🌍, 🐤, 🎁.\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- Row1: 🐤 (count1). Row2: 🌍 → different. No count.\n- Row2: 🌍 (count1). Row3: same → count2. Add 1.\n- Row4: 🐤 → different. Run ends. Then row4: 🐤 (count1). Row5: 🎁 → different. So column5 contributes 1 (the two 🌍s in rows2 and3).\n\nSo column5 adds 1.\n\nSo for vertical columns, total is 1 (column1) +1 (column2) +1 (column3) +1 (column4) +1 (column5) = 5 vertical lines.\n\nNow sum the horizontal and vertical lines: horizontal 4, vertical 5. Total is 4+5=9.\n\nWait, wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, column1's vertical runs: the two 🎁s in rows3 and4. So that's a run of 2. So yes, adds 1.\n\nColumn2: the two 🌍s in rows3 and4. Wait, column2's rows3 and4: row3's column2 is 🌍, row4's column2 is 🌍. So that's two in a row. So adds 1. Yes.\n\nColumn3: in rows3 and4, 🌍 and 🌍 → two in a row. Adds 1.\n\nColumn4: rows4 and5: 🎁 and 🎁. Yes. Adds 1.\n\nColumn5: rows2 and3: 🌍 and 🌍. Adds 1.\n\nSo vertical columns total 5. Horizontally:\n\nRow1: the two 🌍s → 1.\n\nRow3: four 🌍s → 1.\n\nRow4: two 🌍s → 1.\n\nRow5: four 🎁s →1.\n\nWait, row1: [🐤, 🎁, 🌍, 🌍, 🐤]. The third and fourth are 🌍. So that's a run of 2. So yes.\n\nRow3: all five are 🌍s except the first. Wait, row3 is 🎁, then four 🌍s. So the run starts at position 2 (🌍) and has four in a row. So that's a run of four. So that's one line.\n\nRow4: 🎁, 🌍, 🌍, 🎁, 🐤. The second and third are 🌍s. So run of two. Yes.\n\nRow5: 🐤 followed by four 🎁s. So the run is four 🎁s, which counts as one line.\n\nSo horizontal total is 1 (row1) + 1 (row3) +1 (row4) +1 (row5) → 4. Correct.\n\nSo total lines are 4+5=9. But wait, I'm getting 9. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the vertical columns. Let me recheck each column:\n\nColumn1: [🐤, 🌍, 🎁, 🎁, 🐤]\n\nLooking for vertical runs:\n\nBetween rows:\n\nRow1 and 2: 🐤 and 🌍 → different. No run.\n\nRow2 and3: 🌍 and 🎁 → different.\n\nRow3 and4: 🎁 and 🎁 → same. So that's a run of 2. So this counts as 1.\n\nRow4 and5: 🎁 and 🐤 → different.\n\nSo in column1, there's one vertical line (the two 🎁s in rows3 and4).\n\nYes, that's correct. So column1 contributes 1.\n\nColumn2: [🎁, 🐤, 🌍, 🌍, 🎁]\n\nRow1: 🎁. Row2: 🐤 → different.\n\nRow2: 🐤. Row3: 🌍 → different.\n\nRow3: 🌍. Row4: 🌍 → same. So this is a run of 2. So that's 1.\n\nRow4: 🌍. Row5: 🎁 → different.\n\nSo column2 has one vertical line (rows3-4).\n\nYes.\n\nColumn3: [🌍, 🎁, 🌍, 🌍, 🎁]\n\nCheck vertical runs:\n\nRow1: 🌍. Row2: 🎁 → different.\n\nRow2: 🎁. Row3: 🌍 → different.\n\nRow3: 🌍. Row4: 🌍 → same. So run of 2. Add 1.\n\nRow4: 🌍. Row5: 🎁 → different.\n\nSo column3 has one vertical line (rows3-4).\n\nColumn4: [🌍, 🐤, 🌍, 🎁, 🎁]\n\nRow1: 🌍. Row2: 🐤 → different.\n\nRow2: 🐤. Row3: 🌍 → different.\n\nRow3: 🌍. Row4: 🎁 → different.\n\nRow4: 🎁. Row5: 🎁 → same. Run of 2. So adds 1.\n\nSo column4 has one vertical line (rows4-5).\n\nWait, row4's column4 is 🎁, and row5's column4 is 🎁. So yes, run of 2. So that's 1.\n\nColumn5: [🐤, 🌍, 🌍, 🐤, 🎁]\n\nRow1: 🐤. Row2: 🌍 → different.\n\nRow2: 🌍. Row3: 🌍 → same. Run of 2. So adds 1.\n\nRow3: 🌍. Row4: 🐤 → different.\n\nRow4: 🐤. Row5: 🎁 → different.\n\nSo column5 contributes one vertical line (rows2-3).\n\nSo vertical total is 5.\n\nSo horizontal 4 + vertical 5 = 9.\n\nBut I need to make sure I didn't miss any other runs.\n\nWait, what about in row3: all the way from position 2 to 5 are 🌍. So the run in row3 is starting at position2, and the length is 4. So that's one line. Correct.\n\nAnother example: row5 has four 🎁s, which is a single line.\n\nIn column4, rows4 and5 are both 🎁. That's a vertical line.\n\nSo all seems correct. So the total should be 9.\n\n\nAnswer: 9"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of two or more on this board. Hmm. So the board is a 6x6 grid of emojis. Let me visualize it first.\n\nThe board is given as six rows. Let me write them out:\n\nRow 1: 🐋, 🐗, 🐎, 🐎, 🐗, 🐗\nRow 2: 🐋, 🐸, 🐎, 🌙, 🐎, 🐎\nRow 3: 🐋, 🐋, 🐸, 🐸, 🐸, 🐎\nRow 4: 🐗, 🌙, 🐎, 🐎, 🐗, 🐋\nRow 5: 🌙, 🐋, 🐗, 🐋, 🐗, 🐗\nRow 6: 🐋, 🐸, 🐸, 🐸, 🐸, 🐋\n\nNow, lines can be horizontal or vertical, and each line is a sequence of the same emoji. The lines must be of length two or more. Also, overlapping lines count as separate if they are part of different sequences. Wait, but I think the standard way to count here is that each line is a maximal sequence. Or maybe it's that every possible contiguous run counts. For example, a sequence of three in a row would count as one line of length 3, but also could have two overlapping lines (like two pairs). Wait, but the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". So perhaps each consecutive sequence of the same emoji, in a straight line (horizontal or vertical), of length >=2 counts as a line. So for a run of three same emojis in a row, that's a line of length 3, which would contribute 2 lines of length 2 (since 3-2+1=2). Wait, no. Wait, the problem statement is a bit ambiguous here. Because sometimes in such problems, a run of N is considered as N-1 possible pairs. But the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So the way to count is that each consecutive run of same emojis in a line (horizontal or vertical) of length >=2 is considered one line. For example, a horizontal run of 3 same emojis counts as one line of length 3. Then how many lines does that contribute to the total? Because the problem says to count the number of lines. So each run is a single line, regardless of length (as long as it's >=2). So each horizontal or vertical maximal consecutive sequence of the same emoji counts as one line. So for example, a run of 3 in a row would be one line. A run of 4 would be one line. But if there's a break, then they are separate. Like in row 1: the first three emojis are 🐋, 🐗, 🐎, 🐎, 🐗, 🐗. So in row 1, the first 🐋 is alone. Then 🐗 is alone. Then two 🐎 (so a line of 2). Then two 🐗 (another line of 2). So for row 1, horizontal lines are two. Then vertical lines: check each column for consecutive same emojis.\n\nSo the approach is to check all horizontal runs and all vertical runs. For each row, look for consecutive same emojis. For each column, same. Each run of at least two contributes 1 to the total count. So the total number is the sum of all horizontal runs (each run per row) and all vertical runs (each run per column).\n\nLet me start by processing each row for horizontal lines.\n\nRow 1: [🐋, 🐗, 🐎, 🐎, 🐗, 🐗]\nLooking for consecutive same. Let's go step by step:\n\n- Position 0: 🐋. Next is 🐗 (different). No run here.\n- Position 1: 🐗. Next is 🐎 (different). No run.\n- Position 2: 🐎. Next is 🐎. So start a run. This is two in a row. So count 1.\n- Then next is 🐗 (different). So run ends. Then the next 🐗 and 🐗 is another run. So count increases by 1. So row 1 contributes 2.\n\nRow 2: [🐋, 🐸, 🐎, 🌙, 🐎, 🐎]\nCheck:\n- 0: 🐋. Next is 🐸. No.\n- 1: 🐸. Next 🐎. No.\n- 2: 🐎. Next 🌙. No.\n- 3: 🌙. Next 🐎. No.\n- 4: 🐎. Next 🐎. So run of 2. Count +=1. So row 2 contributes 1.\n\nRow 3: [🐋, 🐋, 🐸, 🐸, 🐸, 🐎]\nCheck:\n- 0: 🐋, next is 🐋 → run starts. Then next (index 2) is 🐸. So run of 2. Count +=1.\n- Then index 2 is 🐸, next two are 🐸. So from 2 to 4: three 🐸. So this is a run of 3, which is >=2. Count +=1. So row 3 contributes 2.\n\nRow 4: [🐗, 🌙, 🐎, 🐎, 🐗, 🐋]\nCheck:\n- 0: 🐗 next is 🌙. No.\n- 1: 🌙 next 🐎. No.\n- 2: 🐎 next 🐎. Run of 2. Count +=1.\n- 4: 🐗 next 🐋. No. So row 4 contributes 1.\n\nRow 5: [🌙, 🐋, 🐗, 🐋, 🐗, 🐗]\nCheck:\n- 0: 🌙 next 🐋. No.\n- 1: 🐋 next 🐗. No.\n- 2: 🐗 next 🐋. No.\n- 3: 🐋 next 🐗. No.\n- 4: 🐗 next 🐗. Run of 2. Count +=1. So row 5 contributes 1.\n\nRow 6: [🐋, 🐸, 🐸, 🐸, 🐸, 🐋]\nCheck:\n- 0: 🐋 next 🐸. No.\n- 1: 🐸 next 🐸. Run starts. From index 1 to 4: four 🐸. So a run of 4. Count +=1. So row 6 contributes 1.\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 2+1+2+1+1+1 = 8.\n\nNow check vertical lines. Each column has 6 rows. So for each column, check consecutive same emojis vertically.\n\nLet's process each column:\n\nColumn 0 (row 0 to row 5):\n\nRow 0: 🐋\nRow 1: 🐋\nRow 2: 🐋\nRow 3: 🐗\nRow 4: 🌙\nRow 5: 🐋\n\nLooking for vertical runs. So from top to bottom.\n\nRow 0: 🐋. Next (row1) is 🐋. Then row2 is 🐋. So a run of 3. Then row3 is 🐗. So run ends. So this vertical run is of length 3. So contributes 1. Then row3 🐗, row4 🌙: no. Row5 🐋: no. So column 0 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow0: 🐗\nRow1: 🐸\nRow2: 🐋\nRow3: 🌙\nRow4: 🐋\nRow5: 🐸\n\nNo vertical runs here. All different. So 0.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow0: 🐎\nRow1: 🐎\nRow2: 🐸\nRow3: 🐎\nRow4: 🐗\nRow5: 🐸\n\nCheck:\n\nRow0 🐎, row1 🐎 → run of 2. Then row2 🐸 breaks. So contributes 1.\n\nSo column 2 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow0: 🐎\nRow1: 🌙\nRow2: 🐸\nRow3: 🐎\nRow4: 🐋\nRow5: 🐸\n\nNo vertical runs. All different. So 0.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nRow0: 🐗\nRow1: 🐎\nRow2: 🐸\nRow3: 🐗\nRow4: 🐗\nRow5: 🐸\n\nCheck:\n\nRow0 🐗, row1 🐎 → no.\n\nRow3 🐗, row4 🐗 → run of 2. So contributes 1.\n\nSo column4 contributes 1.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow0: 🐗\nRow1: 🐎\nRow2: 🐎\nRow3: 🐋\nRow4: 🐗\nRow5: 🐋\n\nCheck:\n\nRow0 🐗, row1 🐎 → no.\n\nRow1 🐎, row2 🐎 → run of 2. Contributes 1.\n\nRow4 🐗, row5 🐋 → no.\n\nSo column5 contributes 1.\n\nNow sum up vertical lines: 1 (column0) + 1 (column2) + 1 (column4) + 1 (column5) → total 4.\n\nWait, let's recheck each column again to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRows 0-2: all 🐋. That's three in a vertical line. So one run. Then row3 is different, so yes. So 1.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow0: 🐎, row1: 🐎 → two in a row. So that's a vertical line. So 1.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow3: 🐗, row4: 🐗 → two in a row. So 1.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow1: 🐎, row2: 🐎 → two in a row. So 1.\n\nOther columns:\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🐎, row1: 🌙 → no.\n\nRow1: 🌙, row2: 🐸 → no. Etc. So nothing.\n\nSo vertical lines total 4.\n\nSo horizontal lines are 8, vertical lines 4. Total 12. But wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, column5: row0 is 🐗, row1 is 🐎, row2 is 🐎. So the vertical run in column5 would start at row1. Because row1 and row2 are the same. So that's a vertical run of 2. So column5 contributes 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo vertical total is 4. So 8 + 4 = 12. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in column5.\n\nWait, column5 is:\n\nRow0: 🐗\n\nRow1: 🐎\n\nRow2: 🐎\n\nRow3: 🐋\n\nRow4: 🐗\n\nRow5: 🐋\n\nSo vertically, in column5, check for consecutive same. Let's see:\n\nRow0 and row1: 🐗 vs 🐎 → no.\n\nRow1 and row2: 🐎 and 🐎 → run of 2. So that's a vertical line. Then row2 to row3: 🐎 vs 🐋 → no. Row3 to row4: 🐋 vs 🐗 → no. Row4 to row5: 🐗 vs 🐋 → no. So yes, column5 contributes 1.\n\nSo vertical lines are column0 (1), column2 (1), column4 (1), column5 (1). Total 4.\n\nSo total lines 8+4=12. But wait, let me recheck all rows and columns again to make sure I didn't miss any.\n\nRechecking horizontal lines:\n\nRow1: two runs (🐎🐎 and 🐗🐗) → 2. Correct.\n\nRow2: 🐎🐎 at the end → 1. Correct.\n\nRow3: 🐋🐋 and 🐸🐸🐸 → 2. Correct.\n\nRow4: 🐎🐎 →1. Correct.\n\nRow5: 🐗🐗 →1. Correct.\n\nRow6 (wait, rows are 0-5, so row5 is the last row. Wait the input shows:\n\nThe board is given as:\n\nLine 1: first row.\n\nLine 2: second row, etc. So the six rows are 0-5.\n\nRow5 (sixth row) is 🐋, 🐸, 🐸, 🐸, 🐸, 🐋. So horizontal run is the four 🐸s. So a run of 4 → counts as 1. So row5 (sixth row) contributes 1. So total horizontal is 2+1+2+1+1+1 = 8. Correct.\n\nVertical lines:\n\nColumn0:\n\nRows 0-2: 🐋, 🐋, 🐋 → three in a row. So that's a vertical run of length 3. So contributes 1. Correct.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRows0: 🐎, row1: 🐎. So two. Correct.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRows3 and 4: row3 is 🐗, row4 is 🐗. So two. Correct.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRows1 and 2: 🐎 and 🐎. Correct.\n\nSo vertical is 1+1+1+1=4. So total 12.\n\nWait, but wait another thing: vertical runs can be longer than two. For example, column0's vertical run is three. But each such run counts as 1. So regardless of length. So that's correct.\n\nThus, the answer should be 8+4=12. But let me check again. Maybe I missed a vertical line.\n\nWait, column4 is the fifth column (index 4) in the board. Let's check that column again.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow0: 🐗 (from row0, column4 is index4, row0 is 🐗 in column4? Let me recheck the input.\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow1: 🐋🐗🐎🐎🐗🐗 → columns are 0:🐋, 1:🐗, 2:🐎, 3:🐎, 4:🐗,5:🐗\n\nRow2: 🐋🐸🐎🌙🐎🐎 → columns 0:🐋,1:🐸,2:🐎,3:🌙,4:🐎,5:🐎\n\nRow3: 🐋🐋🐸🐸🐸🐎 → columns 0:🐋,1:🐋,2:🐸,3:🐸,4:🐸,5:🐎\n\nRow4: 🐗🌙🐎🐎🐗🐋 → columns 0:🐗,1:🌙,2:🐎,3:🐎,4:🐗,5:🐋\n\nRow5: 🌙🐋🐗🐋🐗🐗 → columns 0:🌙,1:🐋,2:🐗,3:🐋,4:🐗,5:🐗\n\nRow6: 🐋🐸🐸🐸🐸🐋 → columns 0:🐋,1:🐸,2:🐸,3:🐸,4:🐸,5:🐋\n\nWait, the rows are from 0 to 5 (six rows). So column4 (index4) in each row:\n\nRow0: index4 is 🐗 (row0: positions 0-5: [0]🐋, [1]🐗, [2]🐎, [3]🐎, [4]🐗, [5]🐗 → index4 is 🐗.\n\nRow1: index4 is 🐎.\n\nRow2: index4 is 🐸.\n\nRow3: index4 is 🐗.\n\nRow4: index4 is 🐗.\n\nRow5: index4 is 🐸.\n\nWait, column4 (index4) in each row:\n\nRow0: 🐗\n\nRow1: 🐎\n\nRow2: 🐸\n\nRow3: 🐗\n\nRow4: 🐗\n\nRow5: 🐸\n\nSo the vertical column4 is:\n\nRow0: 🐗\n\nRow1: 🐎 → different from previous.\n\nRow2: 🐸 → different.\n\nRow3: 🐗 → different from row2. So no run so far.\n\nRow4: 🐗 → same as row3. So a run of two (row3 and row4). So yes, this is a vertical line of length 2. So this contributes 1. So that's column4.\n\nSo column4 contributes 1. Correct.\n\nAny other columns with vertical lines?\n\nLooking again:\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow0: 🐗\n\nRow1: 🐎\n\nRow2: 🐎\n\nRow3: 🐋\n\nRow4: 🐗\n\nRow5: 🐋\n\nSo row1 and row2: 🐎 and 🐎 → vertical run of 2. Contributes 1.\n\nWhat about column3?\n\nColumn3 is index3 in each row:\n\nRow0: 🐎\n\nRow1: 🌙\n\nRow2: 🐸\n\nRow3: 🐎\n\nRow4: 🐋\n\nRow5: 🐸\n\nNo consecutive same in vertical. So no.\n\nAnother possible vertical lines:\n\nColumn0 (three 🐋s) → 1.\n\nColumn2: row0 and row1 are 🐎 and 🐎 → vertical run of 2.\n\nWait, column2 (index2) in rows:\n\nRow0: 🐎\n\nRow1: 🐎\n\nRow2: 🐸\n\nRow3: 🐎\n\nRow4: 🐗\n\nRow5: 🐸\n\nSo the vertical run here is row0 and row1: two 🐎s. So that's 1.\n\nAnother vertical line in column2:\n\nRow3 is 🐎, but row4 is 🐗. So no.\n\nSo column2 contributes 1.\n\nAny others?\n\nLet's check column5 again:\n\nRow1 and row2: 🐎 and 🐎 → 1.\n\nNo other runs.\n\nSo vertical lines are columns 0, 2,4,5 → 4. So total 4.\n\nSo adding up horizontal (8) and vertical (4) gives 12. But wait, maybe I'm missing some vertical lines. Let me check again.\n\nAnother possibility: column3 in rows3 and 4?\n\nWait, row3's column3 is 🐎 (row3: [🐗, 🌙, 🐎, 🐎, 🐗, 🐋] → columns index3 is 🐎.\n\nRow4's column3 is 🐋 (row4: 🌙, 🐋, 🐗, 🐋, 🐗, 🐗 → columns index3 is 🐋. So different.\n\nWhat about column4 again:\n\nRow3: 🐗\n\nRow4: 🐗 → same. So that's two. So yes.\n\nAny other columns?\n\nColumn5, row4 is 🐗, row5's column5 is 🐋. No.\n\nWait, column1:\n\nRow0: 🐗 (index1)\n\nRow1: 🐸\n\nRow2: 🐋\n\nRow3: 🌙\n\nRow4: 🐋\n\nRow5: 🐸\n\nNo consecutive same.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🐎\n\nRow1: 🌙\n\nRow2: 🐸\n\nRow3: 🐎\n\nRow4: 🐋\n\nRow5: 🐸\n\nNo vertical runs.\n\nSo vertical lines are indeed 4. So 8 +4=12. But wait, when I look back at the rows and columns, perhaps I missed some horizontal lines.\n\nLet me check the rows again for horizontal lines.\n\nRow3 is 🐋🐋🐸🐸🐸🐎. So the first two 🐋s → one run. Then three 🐸s → another run. So two. Correct.\n\nRow6 (which is row5 in code, since 0-based):\n\nThe row is 🐋, 🐸, 🐸, 🐸, 🐸, 🐋. So the four 🐸s in a row. So one run. Correct.\n\nRow4 (row4 in code):\n\n🐗🌙🐎🐎🐗🐋 → the 🐎🐎 is one run. Correct.\n\nRow5 (code row4):\n\n🌙🐋🐗🐋🐗🐗 → the last two 🐗s. One run. Correct.\n\nNow for vertical lines:\n\nWhat about column0:\n\nRows 0,1,2: all 🐋. So three in a row. But that counts as one line. Correct.\n\nAnother possible vertical line in column2:\n\nRow0: 🐎, row1: 🐎 → two. Then row3: 🐎, but row2 is 🐸, row4 is 🐗 → no.\n\nSo yes, column2 contributes 1.\n\nSo the total is 12. But wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me think again. Oh wait! Wait, for vertical runs, each consecutive same emoji in a column. So for example, column0 has three consecutive 🐋. So that is one vertical line. So 1. Correct.\n\nBut perhaps in column5, the vertical run is row1 and row2 (🐎 and 🐎). Correct. So that's one.\n\nSo summing all up, the answer should be 12.\n\nBut wait, when I first wrote the horizontal lines as 8 and vertical as 4, 12. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the horizontal lines. Let me recount the horizontal lines again.\n\nRow-by-row:\n\nRow 0 (original first line):\n🐋, 🐗, 🐎, 🐎, 🐗, 🐗 → two runs (🐎🐎 and 🐗🐗 → 2.\n\nRow1 (second line):\n🐋, 🐸, 🐎, 🌙, 🐎, 🐎 → the last two 🐎🐎 → 1.\n\nRow2 (third line):\n🐋, 🐋, 🐸, 🐸, 🐸, 🐎 → two runs (🐋🐋 and 🐸🐸🐸 → 2.\n\nRow3 (fourth line):\n🐗, 🌙, 🐎, 🐎, 🐗, 🐋 → 🐎🐎 → 1.\n\nRow4 (fifth line):\n🌙, 🐋, 🐗, 🐋, 🐗, 🐗 → last two 🐗🐗 → 1.\n\nRow5 (sixth line):\n🐋, 🐸, 🐸, 🐸, 🐸, 🐋 → 🐸🐸🐸🐸 → 1.\n\nSo adding 2+1+2+1+1+1=8. Correct.\n\nVertical lines sum to 4.\n\nSo total 12. But I'm wondering if I missed any vertical lines.\n\nWait, what about column5 in row2 and row3?\n\nRow2's column5 is 🐎, row3's column5 is 🐋. So no.\n\nAnother possibility: column0's three 🐋, then row3 is 🐗. So that's one line.\n\nWhat about column0's vertical line is counted as 1. Yes.\n\nSo the answer should be 12. But according to some possible mistakes, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think of another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some horizontal runs have longer sequences but I counted them correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical lines are more.\n\nWait, let me check column4 again. Let's re-express the columns:\n\nColumn4 is the fifth column (index4).\n\nRows for column4:\n\nRow0: 🐗 (from first row's fifth element, which is index4: no. Wait, rows are 0-based. Let me recheck.\n\nOriginal row0 (first row): 🐋🐗🐎🐎🐗🐗. So the elements are:\n\nIndices 0: 🐋\n\n1: 🐗\n\n2: 🐎\n\n3: 🐎\n\n4: 🐗\n\n5: 🐗\n\nSo column4 for row0 is 🐗.\n\nRow1 (second row): 🐋🐸🐎🌙🐎🐎 → column4 is 🐎.\n\nRow2: 🐋🐋🐸🐸🐸🐎 → column4 is 🐸.\n\nRow3: 🐗🌙🐎🐎🐗🐋 → column4 is 🐗.\n\nRow4 (fifth row): 🌙🐋🐗🐋🐗🐗 → column4 is 🐗.\n\nRow5 (sixth row): 🐋🐸🐸🐸🐸🐋 → column4 is 🐸.\n\nSo column4's vertical sequence is:\n\nRow0: 🐗\n\nRow1: 🐎 (different from previous → no run.\n\nRow2: 🐸 → different.\n\nRow3: 🐗 → different from row2.\n\nRow4: 🐗 → same as row3. So two in a row (row3 and row4) → vertical run of 2. So this counts as 1.\n\nSo yes, column4 contributes 1.\n\nSo vertical lines: 4. So 8+4=12.\n\nBut the problem statement says \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\".

I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines made by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more. Hmm. So each line (either horizontal row or vertical column) might have multiple such sequences. Wait, but the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji\"—wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh no, wait. A line here is a consecutive sequence of the same emoji, either in a row (horizontal) or column (vertical). And each such sequence of length 2 or longer counts as one line. But wait, perhaps it's any straight line (horizontal or vertical) where all emojis in that line are the same. Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question says: \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So, perhaps a line here refers to a straight line (horizontal row or vertical column) that is entirely made up of the same emoji. But wait, the example board probably has lines that are not the entire row or column. Wait, but maybe it's consecutive same emojis in a row (horizontal direction) or column (vertical direction). Like, in a row, if there are two same emojis next to each other, that's a line of length 2. Similarly, three in a row would count as one line. But then each row or column would be checked for consecutive runs.\n\nSo for each row, check each consecutive sequence of the same emoji. For each such sequence of length >=2, count it as one. Similarly for each column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering lines as any horizontal or vertical straight line of same emojis, regardless of their position. Like, in a row, even if there are non-consecutive same emojis, if they form a line. Wait, that's possible. For example, in a row like A A B A A. If the row is considered as a line of 5 elements, then there's a horizontal line of 2 at the start, then two in the middle. But perhaps the problem is looking for runs of same emojis in a row (horizontal) or column (vertical), of length >=2. So, consecutive same emojis in a row or column.\n\nLet me think of the example given. Let's look at the first row:\n\n🥀🦕🌳🦕🦕🌳\n\nSo in the first row, looking for consecutive same emojis. The row is:\n\n0: 🥀, 1: 🦕, 2: 🌳, 3: 🦕, 4: 🦕, 5: 🌳.\n\nSo consecutive same starts at 3 and 4 (🦕🦕). That's a run of 2, so that's one horizontal line. So in this row, there's 1 such line.\n\nThe second row: 🐛🐛🦍🦕🥀🐛\n\nSo positions 0 and 1 are 🐛🐛, that's a run of 2. So that's another horizontal line. The rest are single, so this row contributes 1.\n\nThird row: 🌳🌳🌳🐛🥀🥀\n\nSo the first three are 🌳🌳🌳 (length 3), then at positions 4 and 5, 🥀🥀. So each of these runs counts as one. So this row contributes 2 lines.\n\nFourth row: 🦕🥀🐛🦍🦕🥀\n\nLooking for consecutive same. Let's see. Positions 0: 🦕 (alone), 1:🥀 (alone), 2:🐛 (alone), 3: 🦍 (alone), 4:🦕 (alone), 5: 🥀 (alone). No consecutive runs. So this row contributes 0.\n\nFifth row: 🐛🦍🐛🌳🐛🐛\n\nCheck the consecutive runs. At positions 4 and 5: 🐛🐛. So that's a run of 2. So this row contributes 1.\n\nSixth row: 🐛🥀🌳🦕🦍🥀\n\nNo consecutive same emojis. So 0.\n\nSo total horizontal lines from rows: 1 +1 +2 +0 +1 +0 = 5 horizontal lines.\n\nNow checking the vertical lines. For each column, check consecutive same emojis down the column.\n\nThere are 6 columns (each row has 6 elements). Let's look column by column.\n\nColumn 0 (rows 0-5):\n\nRow0: 🥀\n\nRow1: 🐛\n\nRow2: 🌳\n\nRow3: 🦕\n\nRow4: 🐛\n\nRow5: 🐛\n\nSo the column 0 is 🥀, 🐛, 🌳, 🦕, 🐛, 🐛. So consecutive same? Let's see. The elements are:\n\nRow0: 🥀 (different from row1)\n\nRow1: 🐛 (different from row2)\n\nRow2: 🌳 (different from row3)\n\nRow3: 🦕 (different from row4)\n\nRow4: 🐛 (row4 and row5: 🐛🐛 → run of 2. So vertical line here in column 0 at rows4-5. So that's one vertical line.\n\nSo column 0 contributes 1.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow0: 🦕\n\nRow1: 🐛\n\nRow2: 🌳\n\nRow3: 🥀\n\nRow4: 🦍\n\nRow5: 🥀\n\nElements: 🦕, 🐛, 🌳, 🥀, 🦍, 🥀. All different. No runs. So 0.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: 🌳\n\nRow1: 🦍\n\nRow2: 🌳\n\nRow3: 🐛\n\nRow4: 🐛\n\nRow5: 🌳\n\nElements: 🌳, 🦍, 🌳, 🐛, 🐛, 🌳.\n\nCheck consecutive same. Let's see:\n\nRow0 and row1: 🌳 vs 🦍 → different.\n\nRow1 and row2: 🦍 vs 🌳 → different.\n\nRow2 and row3: 🌳 vs 🐛 → different.\n\nRow3 and row4: 🐛 and 🐛 → run of 2. So that's one vertical line in column2 at rows3-4.\n\nRow4 and row5: 🐛 vs 🌳 → different.\n\nSo column2 contributes 1.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🦕\n\nRow1: 🦕\n\nRow2: 🐛\n\nRow3: 🦍\n\nRow4: 🌳\n\nRow5: 🦕.\n\nElements: 🦕, 🦕, 🐛, 🦍, 🌳, 🦕.\n\nCheck consecutive same in the column.\n\nRow0 and row1: 🦕🦕 → run of 2 → that's one vertical line here (rows0-1).\n\nRow1 and row2: 🦕 vs 🐛 → different.\n\nRow3,4,5: no consecutive same.\n\nSo column3 contributes 1.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow0: 🦕\n\nRow1: 🥀\n\nRow2: 🥀\n\nRow3: 🦕\n\nRow4: 🐛\n\nRow5: 🦍.\n\nElements: 🦕, 🥀, 🥀, 🦕, 🐛, 🦍.\n\nLooking for consecutive same:\n\nRow1 and row2: 🥀🥀 → run of 2. So that's one vertical line here (rows1-2).\n\nRow3 and row4: 🦕 vs 🐛 → different.\n\nSo column4 contributes 1.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow0: 🌳\n\nRow1: 🐛\n\nRow2: 🥀\n\nRow3: 🥀\n\nRow4: 🐛\n\nRow5: 🥀.\n\nElements: 🌳, 🐛, 🥀, 🥀, 🐛, 🥀.\n\nCheck consecutive same:\n\nRow2 and row3: 🥀🥀 → run of 2. So vertical line here (rows2-3).\n\nSo column5 contributes 1.\n\nSo vertical lines from columns: column0:1, column2:1, column3:1, column4:1, column5:1. Total vertical lines: 1+1+1+1+1 = 5?\n\nWait, let's recount. Columns:\n\nColumn0: 1\n\nColumn1: 0\n\nColumn2: 1 (rows3-4?)\n\nWait, in column2, row3 is 🐛, row4 is 🐛. So that's a run of 2, yes.\n\nColumn3: run of 2 (rows0-1).\n\nColumn4: run of 2 (rows1-2).\n\nColumn5: run of 2 (rows2-3).\n\nSo column0: rows4-5 (🐛🐛) → yes.\n\nSo columns:\n\n0:1\n\n2:1\n\n3:1\n\n4:1\n\n5:1 → total 5 vertical lines.\n\nSo total vertical lines is 5.\n\nSo total lines (horizontal + vertical) is 5 (horizontal) +5 (vertical) = 10?\n\nWait, but let me check all the calculations again to be sure.\n\nFirst, horizontal lines per row:\n\nRow0: 🥀🦕🌳🦕🦕🌳 → the fourth and fifth (indices 3 and4) are 🦕🦕 → run of 2. So 1.\n\nRow1: 🐛🐛🦍🦕🥀🐛 → first two 🐛🐛 → 1.\n\nRow2: 🌳🌳🌳🐛🥀🥀 → first three 🌳, then two 🥀. So 2.\n\nRow3: all single → 0.\n\nRow4: 🐛🦍🐛🌳🐛🐛 → last two 🐛🐛 → 1.\n\nRow5: all single →0.\n\nTotal horizontal: 1+1+2+0+1+0 =5.\n\nVertical lines per column:\n\nColumn0:\n\nRows4 and5: 🐛🐛 → run of 2. So 1.\n\nColumn1: no runs.\n\nColumn2: rows3 and4: 🐛🐛 → 1.\n\nColumn3: rows0 and1: 🦕🦕 →1.\n\nColumn4: rows1 and2: 🥀🥀 →1.\n\nColumn5: rows2 and3: 🥀🥀 →1.\n\nSo columns 0,2,3,4,5 → 5 vertical lines.\n\nSo total vertical is 5.\n\nTotal lines:5+5=10.\n\nWait, but let me check again.\n\nWait column0: in rows 4 and 5, the emojis are 🐛 and 🐛? Let's check:\n\nRow4 is 🐛🦍🐛🌳🐛🐛 → column0 is row4's first element: 🐛.\n\nRow5 is 🐛🥀🌳🦕🦍🥀 → column0 is 🐛.\n\nSo column0 rows4 and5: 🐛, 🐛 → run of 2. Yes, that's correct → vertical line here. So column0 contributes 1.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🦕 (column3 is the fourth element in row0?)\n\nWait, the rows are:\n\nRow0: 🥀 (col0), 🦕 (col1), 🌳 (col2), 🦕 (col3), 🦕 (col4), 🌳 (col5).\n\nRow1: 🐛 (col0), 🐛 (col1), 🦍 (col2), 🦕 (col3), 🥀 (col4), 🐛 (col5).\n\nSo column3 is the fourth element in each row.\n\nSo row0's column3 is index3 → 🦕.\n\nRow1's column3: index3 → 🦕.\n\nRow2's column3: row2 is 🌳🌳🌳🐛🥀🥀 → column3 is 🐛.\n\nRow3's column3: 🦍.\n\nRow4's column3: 🌳.\n\nRow5's column3: 🦕.\n\nSo column3's elements are: 🦕, 🦕, 🐛, 🦍, 🌳, 🦕.\n\nSo consecutive runs here: rows0 and1 are 🦕🦕 → run of 2. So that's a vertical line. Then, row5 is 🦕 but the one before is 🌳 (row4). So only one run here. So column3 contributes 1.\n\nSo yes, vertical lines sum to 5.\n\nSo total lines are 5+5=10. So the answer is 10.\n\nWait but wait, let me check again for the vertical columns.\n\nWait column4:\n\nColumn4's elements:\n\nRow0: 🦕 (col4).\n\nRow1: 🥀 (col4).\n\nRow2: 🥀 (col4).\n\nRow3: 🦕 (col4).\n\nRow4: 🐛 (col4).\n\nRow5: 🦍 (col4).\n\nSo elements in column4: 🦕, 🥀, 🥀, 🦕, 🐛, 🦍.\n\nLooking for consecutive same. Row1 and row2: 🥀 and 🥀 → run of 2. So that's a vertical line. So column4 contributes 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, column5:\n\nRow0: 🌳.\n\nRow1: 🐛.\n\nRow2: 🥀.\n\nRow3: 🥀.\n\nRow4: 🐛.\n\nRow5: 🥀.\n\nElements in column5: 🌳, 🐛, 🥀, 🥀, 🐛, 🥀.\n\nLooking for consecutive same. Row2 and row3: 🥀🥀 → run of 2. So column5 contributes 1.\n\nSo all vertical columns contribute 5.\n\nSo adding all up, horizontal lines 5, vertical lines 5, total 10. So answer should be 10.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I've missed any.\n\nAnother example: row2, which has three 🌳s followed by two 🥀s. So two horizontal lines here.\n\nYes.\n\nRow4 (fifth row) has 🐛🦍🐛🌳🐛🐛. The last two 🐛s → a run of 2. So 1.\n\nRow5 (sixth row) has no runs.\n\nSo horizontal total is 1 (row0) +1 (row1)+2 (row2)+0 (row3)+1 (row4) +0 (row5) =5.\n\nVertical columns:\n\nColumn0: runs in rows4-5 → 1.\n\nColumn1: none.\n\nColumn2: runs in rows3-4 (🐛🐛) →1.\n\nColumn3: runs in rows0-1 (🦕🦕) →1.\n\nColumn4: runs in rows1-2 (🥀🥀) →1.\n\nColumn5: runs in rows2-3 (🥀🥀) →1.\n\nSo vertical total:5.\n\nSo total answer is 10. So the answer should be 10.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by consecutive identical emojis with a length of 2 or more on the given board. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Horizontal Lines**: For each row, check consecutive emojis and count runs of length ≥2.\n2. **Vertical Lines**: For each column, check consecutive emojis and count runs of length ≥2.\n3. **Sum**: Add the counts from horizontal and vertical lines to get the final answer.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nboard = [\n    [\"🥀\", \"🦕\", \"🌳\", \"🦕\", \"🦕\", \"🌳\"],\n    [\"🐛\", \"🐛\", \"🦍\", \"🦕\", \"🥀\", \"🐛\"],\n    [\"🌳\", \"🌳\", \"🌳\", \"🐛\", \"🥀\", \"🥀\"],\n    [\"🦕\", \"🥀\", \"🐛\", \"🦍\", \"🦕\", \"🥀\"],\n    [\"🐛\", \"🦍\", \"🐛\", \"🌳\", \"🐛\", \"🐛\"],\n    [\"🐛\", \"🥀\", \"🌳\", \"🦕\", \"🦍\", \"🥀\"]\n]\n\ndef count_lines(board):\n    rows = len(board)\n    cols = len(board[0])\n    count = 0\n\n    # Check horizontal lines (rows)\n    for row in board:\n        current = None\n        run_length = 1\n        for emoji in row:\n            if emoji == current:\n                run_length += 1\n            else:\n                current = emoji\n                run_length = 1\n            if run_length == 2:\n                count += 1\n            elif run_length > 2:\n                count += 1  # Only increment if extending beyond existing count\n\n    # Check vertical lines (columns)\n    for c in range(cols):\n        current = None\n        run_length = 1\n        for r in range(rows):\n            emoji = board[r][c]\n            if emoji == current:\n                run_length += 1\n            else:\n                current = emoji\n                run_length = 1\n            if run_length == 2:\n                count += 1\n            elif run_length > 2:\n                count += 1  # Only increment if extending beyond existing count\n\n    return count\n\nprint(count_lines(board))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Horizontal Check**: Each row is traversed to find consecutive sequences of the same emoji.

I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines of the same emoji with length 2 or more in this board. The lines can be horizontal (left-right) or vertical (up-down). Each line must consist of the same emoji and have a length of at least two. Also, overlapping lines count as separate if they are part of different sequences. Hmm.\n\nSo the board is a 6x6 grid. Let me try to visualize it based on the given data.\n\nThe board is given as rows separated by line breaks. Each row is a sequence of emojis. Let me list out each row.\n\nRow 0: 🐠 🦉 🏄 🦉 🐠 🏄\nRow 1: 🦉 🏄 🎋 🐠 🎋 ⛅️\nRow 2: 🦉 🎋 🦉 🎋 🏄 🏄\nRow 3: ⛅️ 🐠 🐠 🦉 🎋 🎋\nRow 4: 🎋 🦉 🏄 🎋 🏄 🏄\nRow 5: 🐠 ⛅️ 🏄 🎋 🐠 🏄\n\nNow, I need to check each possible horizontal line in each row and vertical line in each column.\n\nFor horizontal lines: In each row, check consecutive emojis. For example, in row 3, the first two emojis are 🐠 and 🐠. That's a horizontal line of length 2. Then, the last two in row 3 are 🎋 🎋, another horizontal line of length 2.\n\nBut wait, longer lines would count as multiple lines. For example, a line of 3 same emojis would have two lines of length 2 (positions 0-1 and 1-2). Or does each maximal line count as one? Wait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So I think each such maximal line of length N contributes (N-1) lines. Wait no, that's not right. Wait, for example, a horizontal line of 3 same emojis in a row would form a line of length 3. But according to the problem, the line has to be of length 2 or more. So each maximal line of length L contributes (L -1) lines? Because each possible consecutive pair is a line of at least length 2. Wait no. Wait, the line itself is considered as a single line. Like, if there's a sequence of 3 same emojis in a row, that counts as one line of length 3. But the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So each such maximal consecutive sequence (horizontal or vertical) counts as one line if its length is >=2. So for example, a horizontal sequence of 3 same emojis counts as a single line. Then, the total count is the number of such maximal sequences in horizontal and vertical directions.\n\nWait, the question says \"number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So each line is a maximal consecutive sequence (either horizontal or vertical) of the same emoji, and the length is 2 or more. So each such sequence counts as one. So for example, a horizontal sequence of 3 same emojis would count as one line. If there's another sequence in the same row (like after a break), that would count as another line.\n\nSo the approach is to check each row for horizontal sequences and each column for vertical sequences. For each row, iterate through each cell, check consecutive cells to the right (for horizontal) and below (for vertical) to find the maximum consecutive sequences.\n\nWait, no. For horizontal lines in a row: For each row, scan from left to right, grouping consecutive same emojis. For each group, if the length is >=2, count it as one. Similarly for vertical lines in each column: for each column, scan top to bottom, group consecutive same emojis. For each group of length >=2, count as one.\n\nSo the total count is the sum of such groups in all rows (horizontal) and all columns (vertical).\n\nSo let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, process horizontal lines.\n\nRow 0: 🐠 🦉 🏄 🦉 🐠 🏄\n\nLooking at row 0:\n\nPositions 0-0: 🐠. Next is 🦉. Different. So group length 1. No count.\nPosition 1: 🦉. Next is 🏄. Different. Group length 1. No count.\nPosition 2: 🏄. Next is 🦉. Different. Group length 1. No count.\nPosition 3: 🦉. Next is 🐠. Different. Group length 1. No count.\nPosition 4: 🐠. Next is 🏄. Different. Group length 1. No count.\nSo row 0 has no horizontal lines.\n\nRow 1: 🦉 🏄 🎋 🐠 🎋 ⛅️\n\nCheck each group. All consecutive are different. So no horizontal lines here.\n\nRow 2: 🦉 🎋 🦉 🎋 🏄 🏄\n\nLooking for groups. The last two are 🏄🏄. So group length 2. Counts as one horizontal line.\n\nOther positions: positions 0-1: 🦉🎋 (diff), 1-2: 🎋🦉 (diff), 2-3: 🦉🎋 (diff), 3-4: 🎋🏄 (diff). So only the last two are a group of 2.\n\nRow 2 contributes 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow 3: ⛅️ 🐠 🐠 🦉 🎋 🎋\n\nCheck groups. Position 1-2: 🐠🐠 (length 2). Then position 4-5: 🎋🎋 (length 2). So two horizontal lines in this row.\n\nRow 3 contributes 2.\n\nRow 4: 🎋 🦉 🏄 🎋 🏄 🏄\n\nLooking for consecutive groups. The last two are 🏄🏄 (length 2). Also, position 3 is 🎋, position 4 is 🏄 (different). So only the last two contribute a horizontal line. So 1 line here.\n\nRow 5: 🐠 ⛅️ 🏄 🎋 🐠 🏄\n\nAll consecutive emojis are different. So no horizontal lines here.\n\nSo horizontal lines total: 0 (row 0) + 0 (row1) + 1 (row2) + 2 (row3) + 1 (row4) + 0 (row5) = 4.\n\nNow process vertical lines. For each column, check each cell, group consecutive same emojis in the column.\n\nEach column has 6 rows. Let's check each column 0 to 5.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRows 0-5, column 0:\n\nRow0: 🐠\n\nRow1: 🦉\n\nRow2: 🦉\n\nRow3: ⛅️\n\nRow4: 🎋\n\nRow5: 🐠\n\nSo the sequence is 🐠, 🦉, 🦉, ⛅️, 🎋, 🐠.\n\nCheck groups:\n\nRow0: 🐠. Next is row1: 🦉. Different. Group length 1. No.\n\nRow1: 🦉. Next row2: 🦉. Same. So group starts at row1, length 2. So a vertical line here. Then row3 is ⛅️, different. So group is rows 1-2 (length 2). So one vertical line in column 0.\n\nRow3: ⛅️. Next is row4: 🎋. Different. No group.\n\nRow4: 🎋. Next is row5: 🐠. Different. No group.\n\nSo column 0 contributes 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRows 0-5, column1:\n\nRow0: 🦉\n\nRow1: 🏄\n\nRow2: 🎋\n\nRow3: 🐠\n\nRow4: 🦉\n\nRow5: ⛅️\n\nSequence: 🦉, 🏄, 🎋, 🐠, 🦉, ⛅️.\n\nAll consecutive different. So no vertical lines in column1.\n\nColumn1: 0.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRows 0-5, column2:\n\nRow0: 🏄\n\nRow1: 🎋\n\nRow2: 🦉\n\nRow3: 🐠\n\nRow4: 🏄\n\nRow5: 🏄\n\nSequence: 🏄, 🎋, 🦉, 🐠, 🏄, 🏄.\n\nLooking for consecutive same.\n\nRow4: 🏄, row5: 🏄. Group length 2. So from row4 to row5, same. So group length 2. That's one vertical line.\n\nOther parts: rows0-1: 🏄 and 🎋 (different). rows1-2: 🎋 and 🦉 (diff). etc.\n\nSo column2 has one vertical line.\n\nColumn2 contributes 1.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRows0-5, column3:\n\nRow0: 🦉\n\nRow1: 🐠\n\nRow2: 🎋\n\nRow3: 🦉\n\nRow4: 🎋\n\nRow5: 🎋\n\nSequence: 🦉, 🐠, 🎋, 🦉, 🎋, 🎋.\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\nRow3: 🦉. Row4: 🎋 (different).\n\nRow4: 🎋. Row5: 🎋. Same. Group length 2. So one vertical line here (rows4-5).\n\nNo other groups.\n\nSo column3 contributes 1.\n\nColumn3: 1.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRows0-5, column4:\n\nRow0: 🐠\n\nRow1: 🎋\n\nRow2: 🏄\n\nRow3: 🎋\n\nRow4: 🏄\n\nRow5: 🐠\n\nSequence: 🐠, 🎋, 🏄, 🎋, 🏄, 🐠.\n\nAll consecutive different. No vertical lines.\n\nColumn4: 0.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRows0-5, column5:\n\nRow0: 🏄\n\nRow1: ⛅️\n\nRow2: 🏄\n\nRow3: 🎋\n\nRow4: 🏄\n\nRow5: 🏄\n\nSequence: 🏄, ⛅️, 🏄, 🎋, 🏄, 🏄.\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\nRow0: 🏄. Row1: ⛅️ (diff).\n\nRow1: ⛅️. Row2: 🏄 (diff).\n\nRow2: 🏄. Row3: 🎋 (diff).\n\nRow3: 🎋. Row4: 🏄 (diff).\n\nRow4: 🏄. Row5: 🏄. Same. Group of length 2. So one vertical line here (rows4-5).\n\nSo column5 has one vertical line.\n\nColumn5 contributes 1.\n\nTotal vertical lines: column0 (1) + column1 (0) + column2 (1) + column3 (1) + column4 (0) + column5 (1) → sum is 1+0+1+1+0+1=4.\n\nSo total lines: horizontal (4) + vertical (4) = 8.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Let me recount the vertical lines again.\n\nColumn0: groups at rows1-2 (🦉🦉) → 1.\n\nColumn2: group at rows4-5 (🏄🏄) → 1.\n\nColumn3: group at rows4-5 (🎋🎋) → 1.\n\nColumn5: group at rows4-5 (🏄🏄) → 1.\n\nSo vertical lines sum to 1+1+1+1=4. Yes.\n\nHorizontal lines sum to 4: row2 (1), row3 (2), row4 (1).\n\nSo total 4 +4=8. So the answer should be 8.\n\nBut wait, let me check each row again for horizontal lines.\n\nRow3: ⛅️ 🐠 🐠 🦉 🎋 🎋.\n\nThe first two of row3 are 🐠 and 🐠 (positions 1 and 2?), wait the structure of row3 is:\n\nRow3: ⛅️ (0), 🐠 (1), 🐠 (2), 🦉 (3), 🎋 (4), 🎋 (5).\n\nSo the groups here are at positions 1-2 (🐠🐠) → length 2, and 4-5 (🎋🎋) → length 2. So two horizontal lines. That's correct.\n\nRow4: 🎋 🦉 🏄 🎋 🏄 🏄.\n\nThe last two (positions 4 and 5) are 🏄🏄. So that's a horizontal line of length 2. So row4 contributes 1. Correct.\n\nRow2: 🦉 🎋 🦉 🎋 🏄 🏄. The last two positions (4 and5) are 🏄🏄. So group of length 2. So row2 contributes 1.\n\nSo horizontal lines: row2 (1), row3 (2), row4 (1) → total 4.\n\nVertical lines: 4.\n\nTotal 8.

I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more on this board. Hmm. So each line (horizontal or vertical) that has consecutive same emojis, and the length is at least 2. But wait, how do lines work? Like, if there's a longer sequence, say 3 in a row, does that count as one line or two (since two pairs)? Oh right, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". So each maximal line of length n contributes (n >=2) counts as 1. Or wait, maybe the question is counting every possible consecutive run. Wait, the way the problem is phrased: \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". So for example, a horizontal line of 3 same emojis in a row would count as 1 line. Because the line's length is 3, which is >=2. Similarly, if there's a vertical line of 2, that's one. But if the same emoji appears in a line longer than 2, each possible run counts as 1. Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering each maximal consecutive line. So for a horizontal row like 🦏🦏🦏 in the second row (positions 4,5,6?), that's a horizontal line of length 3. So that's one horizontal line. Similarly, vertical lines are sequences in the same column.\n\nSo the task is to check each possible horizontal and vertical line (in rows and columns) and count how many lines of length >=2 exist. So each row is checked for consecutive same emojis. For example, in the first row: 🦒😆🐯🌴🐯😆☄️. Let's look for consecutive duplicates. The first emoji is 🦒, next is 😆. Different. Then 😆 to 🐯, different. Then 🐯 to 🌴, different. Then 🌴 to 🐯. Different. Then 🐯 to 😆. Different. Then 😆 to ☄️. So no horizontal lines in the first row.\n\nSecond row: 🦏🐯🦒☄️🦏🦏🦏. Let's check. The first is 🦏, next is 🐯. Different. Then 🐯 to 🦒. Different. Then 🦒 to ☄️. Different. Then ☄️ to 🦏. Different. Then 🦏 to 🦏 (positions 5 and 6), same. Then 🦏 to 🦏 (6 and7). So the last three are 🦏. So in the row, there's a run of 3 🦏. So that's one horizontal line. So that's +1.\n\nThird row: 🌴☄️☄️🦏🦒🌴🌴. Let's see. The second and third emojis are ☄️☄️. So a run of 2. Then the sixth and seventh are 🌴🌴. So that's two horizontal lines in this row. So +2.\n\nFourth row: ☄️😆🦢🦏🐯🦢🦏. Let's check. Each adjacent pair: ☄️ and 😆 (no), 😆 and 🦢 (no), 🦢 and 🦏 (no), 🦏 and 🐯 (no), 🐯 and 🦢 (no), 🦢 and 🦏. So no consecutive duplicates here. So no horizontal lines in this row.\n\nFifth row: 🦒😆🌴🐯🦒🐯🌴. Check each pair. None consecutive same. So no.\n\nSixth row: 😆🦒🦢🦢😆🦒😆. Let's look. The third and fourth are 🦢🦢. So that's a run of 2. So +1.\n\nSeventh row: 🌴😆🦒🦏🦢☄️🐯. No consecutive duplicates. So no.\n\nNow vertical lines. Need to check each column. Let's see. The board has 7 rows and 7 columns.\n\nColumn 1:\nRow 1: 🦒\nRow 2: 🦏\nRow3: 🌴\nRow4: ☄️\nRow5: 🦒\nRow6: 😆\nRow7: 🌴\nNo consecutive same here. So no.\n\nColumn 2:\nRow1: 😆\nRow2: 🐯\nRow3: ☄️\nRow4: 😆\nRow5: 😆\nRow6: 🦒\nRow7: 😆\nWait, let's list them all. The column is positions (2nd in each row):\n\nRow1: 😆\n\nRow2: 🐯 (different from above)\n\nRow3: ☄️ (different)\n\nRow4: 😆 (different from previous ☄️)\n\nRow5: 😆 (same as row4's 😆? Wait, row4's column2 is 😆? Let's check. Fourth row is: ☄️😆🦢🦏🐯🦢🦏. So column 2 is 😆. Row5's column2 is 😆 (the fifth row is 🦒😆🌴🐯🦒🐯🌴. So yes, column2 is 😆. So rows4,5: 😆 and 😆. So a vertical run of 2. Then row6's column2 is 🦒 (different). So in column2, there's a run of 2 😆 (rows4 and5). So that's one vertical line. So +1.\n\nWait, but vertical lines are consecutive in the same column. So looking for runs in the column.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow1: 🐯\n\nRow2: 🦒\n\nRow3: ☄️\n\nRow4: 🦢\n\nRow5: 🌴\n\nRow6: 🦢\n\nRow7: 🦒\n\nNo consecutive duplicates here. So nothing.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow1: 🌴\n\nRow2: ☄️\n\nRow3: 🦏\n\nRow4: 🦏\n\nRow5: 🐯\n\nRow6: 🦢\n\nRow7: 🦏\n\nLooking for consecutive same. Row2's column4 is ☄️. Row3: 🦏. Different. Row3: 🦏, row4: 🦏. So rows3 and4 are same. That's a run of 2. So vertical line in column4. +1.\n\nThen row4: 🦏, row5: 🐯 (different). So column4's run is 2.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow1: 🐯\n\nRow2: 🦏\n\nRow3: 🦒\n\nRow4: 🐯\n\nRow5: 🦒\n\nRow6: 😆\n\nRow7: 🦢\n\nNo consecutive same.\n\nColumn6:\n\nRow1: 😆\n\nRow2: 🦏\n\nRow3: 🌴\n\nRow4: 🦢\n\nRow5: 🐯\n\nRow6: 🦒\n\nRow7: ☄️\n\nNo consecutive duplicates.\n\nColumn7:\n\nRow1: ☄️\n\nRow2: 🦏\n\nRow3: 🌴\n\nRow4: 🦏\n\nRow5: 🌴\n\nRow6: 😆\n\nRow7: 🐯\n\nNo consecutive same.\n\nWait, let me double-check each column.\n\nAnother column to check: Column 2 again. Let's re-examine:\n\nRow1: 😆\n\nRow2: 🐯 (different, so no run)\n\nRow3: ☄️ (different)\n\nRow4: 😆 (different from row3's ☄️)\n\nRow5: 😆 (same as row4's 😆. So rows4 and5 are 😆😆. So that's a run of 2. So column2 has one vertical line.\n\nColumn4: rows3 and4 are 🦏 and 🦏. So run of 2. So vertical line.\n\nAre there any other vertical lines?\n\nCheck column6, row2: 🦏. Then row3: 🌴. So no. Column5: row1: 🐯, row2: 🦏 (different). row4: 🐯, row5: 🦒 (different). No.\n\nOther columns?\n\nWait, maybe column2 has another run. Let's see:\n\nRow4: 😆, row5: 😆. That's a run of length 2. So yes. That's one vertical.\n\nWhat about column5? Let's see. Column5 is row1: 🐯, row2: 🦏 (different), row3: 🦒 (different), row4: 🐯 (different from row3), row5: 🦒 (different from row4's 🐯), row6: 😆, row7: 🦢. No runs.\n\nAny other vertical lines?\n\nColumn7: row1: ☄️, row2: 🦏, row3: 🌴, row4: 🦏, row5: 🌴, row6: 😆, row7: 🐯. No.\n\nSo vertical lines: column2 (1), column4 (1). So two vertical lines.\n\nNow, let's sum all horizontal and vertical lines.\n\nHorizontal lines:\n\nRow2: 1 (three 🦏, counts as 1 line)\n\nRow3: 2 (two ☄️ and two 🌴)\n\nRow6: 1 (two 🦢)\n\nSo total horizontal lines: 1 + 2 +1 =4.\n\nVertical lines: 2.\n\nSo total is 4 +2 =6.\n\nWait, but let me recheck each row again.\n\nRow2: the last three 🦏. So that's a run of 3. So counts as 1 line. Correct.\n\nRow3: the second and third are ☄️☄️ (run of 2), and then sixth and seventh are 🌴🌴 (run of 2). So two lines. Yes.\n\nRow6: third and fourth are 🦢🦢. So run of 2. So one line.\n\nSo horizontal lines: 1 (row2) + 2 (row3) +1 (row6) =4.\n\nVertical lines: 2 (columns 2 and 4). So 2.\n\nTotal 4+2=6.\n\nWait, but let me check row3 again. Let me look at the third row:\n\nThird row: 🌴☄️☄️🦏🦒🌴🌴\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nPositions 1: 🌴\n\n2: ☄️\n\n3: ☄️\n\n4: 🦏\n\n5: 🦒\n\n6: 🌴\n\n7: 🌴\n\nSo the consecutive pairs are 1-2: 🌴☄️ (no), 2-3: ☄️☄️ (yes, run of 2). Then 3-4: ☄️🦏 (no). Then 4-5: 🦏🦒 (no). 5-6: 🦒🌴 (no). 6-7: 🌴🌴 (yes). So two runs. So row3 contributes 2. That's correct.\n\nRow6: 😆🦒🦢🦢😆🦒😆\n\nBreaking down:\n\nPositions 3 and4: 🦢🦢. So run of 2. So contributes 1.\n\nOther pairs: 1-2: 😆🦒 (no), 2-3: 🦒🦢 (no), 4-5: 🦢😆 (no), etc. So yes, one run.\n\nSo yes, horizontal lines are 4.\n\nVertical:\n\nColumn2: rows4 and5 are both 😆. So two consecutive, so that's one line.\n\nColumn4: rows3 and4 are 🦏 and 🦏. So one line.\n\nAny others? Let's see.\n\nCheck column5:\n\nRow1: 🐯\n\nRow2: 🦏 (different)\n\nRow3: 🦒 (different)\n\nRow4: 🐯\n\nRow5: 🦒\n\nNo.\n\nWhat about column6?\n\nRow1: 😆\n\nRow2: 🦏\n\nNo.\n\nAny other columns?\n\nColumn7: no.\n\nSo vertical lines count is 2.\n\nSo total is 4+2=6. But wait, the sample answer was 192. Wait, that's impossible. Wait, the user's example was Answer:192, but that's just an example. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in vertical lines. Let me recheck all columns.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow1: 🦒\n\nRow2: 🦏 (different)\n\nRow3: 🌴 (different)\n\nRow4: ☄️ (different)\n\nRow5: 🦒 (different from row4)\n\nRow6: 😆 (different)\n\nRow7: 🌴 (different). No runs.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow1: 😆\n\nRow2: 🐯 (different)\n\nRow3: ☄️ (different)\n\nRow4: 😆 (different from row3's ☄️. So row4 is 😆, row5 is 😆 (same). So row4 and row5: two consecutive. So that's a vertical line of 2. So count 1.\n\nRow6: 🦒 (different from row5's 😆)\n\nRow7: 😆 (different from row6's 🦒). So yes, column2 has one vertical line.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow1: 🐯\n\nRow2: 🦒 (different)\n\nRow3: ☄️ (different)\n\nRow4: 🦢 (different)\n\nRow5: 🌴 (different)\n\nRow6: 🦢 (different)\n\nRow7: 🦒 (different). No runs.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow1: 🌴\n\nRow2: ☄️ (different)\n\nRow3: 🦏 (different)\n\nRow4: 🦏 (same as row3's 🦏. So rows3 and4: 🦏🦏. So run of 2. So vertical line. So count 1.\n\nRow5: 🐯 (different)\n\nRow6: 🦢 (different)\n\nRow7: 🦏 (different). So yes, column4 has one.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow1: 🐯\n\nRow2: 🦏 (different)\n\nRow3: 🦒 (different)\n\nRow4: 🐯 (different from row3's 🦒)\n\nRow5: 🦒 (different from row4's 🐯)\n\nRow6: 😆 (different)\n\nRow7: 🦢 (different). No runs.\n\nColumn6:\n\nRow1: 😆\n\nRow2: 🦏 (different)\n\nRow3: 🌴 (different)\n\nRow4: 🦢 (different)\n\nRow5: 🐯 (different)\n\nRow6: 🦒 (different)\n\nRow7: ☄️ (different). No runs.\n\nColumn7:\n\nRow1: ☄️\n\nRow2: 🦏 (different)\n\nRow3: 🌴 (different)\n\nRow4: 🦏 (different)\n\nRow5: 🌴 (different)\n\nRow6: 😆 (different)\n\nRow7: 🐯 (different). No runs.\n\nSo vertical lines are 2. So the total is 4+2=6?\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another vertical line. Let me check again.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow3: 🦏, row4: 🦏. So two in a row. So yes.\n\nNo others.\n\nWait, what about column5?\n\nRow4's column5 is 🐯, row5's is 🦒. Different. So no.\n\nColumn7: no.\n\nSo vertical is two.\n\nHmm. So total is 6.\n\nBut wait, let me check again the horizontal lines.\n\nRow3's second and third emojis are ☄️☄️. That's a run of 2. The sixth and seventh are 🌴🌴. Another run of 2. So two lines in that row. Correct.\n\nRow2's last three 🦏: that's a run of 3. So one line.\n\nRow6's third and fourth 🦢🦢: one line.\n\nAre there any other horizontal lines?\n\nRow1: no. Row4: no. Row5: no. Row7: no.\n\nSo yes, 4 horizontal.\n\nVertical: columns 2 and4. Two lines.\n\nTotal 6. But maybe I missed some?\n\nWait, wait, let's look at row5 again. The fifth row is 🦒😆🌴🐯🦒🐯🌴. So the emojis are:\n\n1: 🦒\n\n2: 😆\n\n3: 🌴\n\n4: 🐯\n\n5: 🦒\n\n6: 🐯\n\n7: 🌴\n\nNo consecutive duplicates. So no.\n\nRow4: ☄️😆🦢🦏🐯🦢🦏. No consecutive same.\n\nRow7: 🌴😆🦒🦏🦢☄️🐯. No consecutive.\n\nWhat about row6: 😆🦒🦢🦢😆🦒😆. Positions 3-4: 🦢🦢. So yes.\n\nNow, let's check for vertical lines again. Wait, maybe in column5:\n\nRow1: 🐯\n\nRow4: 🐯\n\nAre those consecutive? No, they're in rows 1 and4, so three rows apart. So not consecutive. So vertical lines need to be consecutive in the same column.\n\nSo column2's vertical line is rows4 and5. Because they are consecutive in the same column.\n\nSo column4's vertical line is rows3 and4. Because consecutive.\n\nNow, another thing to check: in row3's column4: 🦏. row4's column4: 🦏. So consecutive, yes. So vertical line.\n\nSo vertical lines count is correct.\n\nSo total answer is 6.\n\n\nAnswer: 6"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

So, I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines of the same emoji where the length is 2 or more on this board. Hmm, lines can be either horizontal (same row) or vertical (same column). Each line's length must be at least 2. But wait, the same emoji in a consecutive line, right? Like, if there's a row like 🐮🐮🐮, that's a line of length 3. But maybe overlapping lines count as separate? Like, in a row of three, there are two lines of length 2. Wait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". So maybe each maximal line is counted once. Wait, the problem is a bit ambiguous here. For example, if there's a sequence of four same emojis in a row, is that considered one line of length 4 (counted once) or two lines of 2 (counted twice for each possible pair)? The problem statement says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". So I think each maximal consecutive line (longest possible) is counted once. So a sequence of four would contribute one line of length 4, which counts as 1. Because the line is of length >=2. So the approach is to check each row and column for consecutive same emojis, count each maximal run once if its length is >=2.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Iterate through each row, check for consecutive same emojis. For each row, split into runs (maximal sequences of the same emoji). For each run of length >=2, add 1 to the count.\n\n2. Do the same for each column. For each column, check vertical runs. Again, for each run of length >=2, add 1 to the count.\n\nThen sum all those counts to get the total.\n\nSo first, let's process each row. Let me look at the given board.\n\nThe board is 10x10, given as 10 rows. Let's list them out:\n\nRow 0: 🐛🦩🐮🐮💫🦩🐗🐜🐮🐮\n\nRow 1: 🐛🐮💫🐛🐜🕷🐛💫🐗🕷\n\nRow 2: 🦩🦕🕷🕷💫🐛💫🦕🐜🐮\n\nRow 3: 🐛🐛🐗🐛🦕💫🐮🐜🐜🕷\n\nRow 4: 🐮🦕🐜🐮🐗🐛🐗🦕🐗🦕\n\nRow 5: 💫🐜🐛🕷🐗🦕🦋🦕🐛🦋\n\nRow 6: 💫🐮🕷🕷🐛🐜🦋🕷🦕🕷\n\nRow 7: 🦩🦩🐮🕷🐮🐮💫🦩💫🕷\n\nRow 8: 🦋🦋🐗🐮🐗🦋🦋🦕🐛🐛\n\nRow 9: 🕷🐛🐜🕷💫🦩🐛🐗🦩🦋\n\nNow, for each row, check the horizontal runs.\n\nLet's start with row 0: 🐛, then 🦩, then two 🐮, then 💫, then 🦩, then 🐗, then 🐜, then two 🐮.\n\nSo the runs here are:\n\n- 🐛 (length 1) → no count.\n\n- 🦩 (1) → no.\n\n- 🐮🐮 → length 2 → count +=1.\n\n- 💫 → 1.\n\n- 🦩 →1.\n\n- 🐗 →1.\n\n- 🐜 →1.\n\n- 🐮🐮 → another run of 2 → count +=1. So row 0 contributes 2.\n\nRow 1: 🐛, then 🐮, then 💫, then 🐛, then 🐜, then 🕷, then 🐛, then 💫, then 🐗, then 🕷.\n\nEach emoji alternates. No runs of 2 or longer. So row 1 contributes 0.\n\nRow 2: 🦩, 🦕, then two 🕷, 💫, 🐛, 💫, 🦕, 🐜, 🐮.\n\nRuns here: 🕷🕷 → 2 → count +=1. So row 2 contributes 1.\n\nRow 3: 🐛🐛 → 2 → count +=1. Then 🐗 (1), 🐛 (1), 🦕 (1), 💫 (1), 🐮 (1), then 🐜🐜 → 2 → count +=1. Then 🕷 (1). So row 3 has two runs → total 2.\n\nRow 4: 🐮 (1), 🦕 (1), 🐜 (1), 🐮 (1), 🐗 (1), 🐛 (1), 🐗 (1), 🦕 (1), 🐗 (1), 🦕 (1). All single emojis. No runs. So 0.\n\nRow 5: 💫 (1), 🐜 (1), 🐛 (1), 🕷 (1), 🐗 (1), 🦕 (1), 🦋 (1), 🦕 (1), 🐛 (1), 🦋 (1). All single. No runs → 0.\n\nRow 6: 💫 (1), 🐮 (1), 🕷🕷 (count +=1), then 🐛 (1), 🐜 (1), 🦋 (1), 🕷 (1), 🦕 (1), 🕷 (1). The runs here are 🕷🕷 (count 1), and then later the 🕷 at position 7 and 9? Wait, the row is: 🕷🕷 (positions 2 and 3?), then after that, other emojis. So in row 6, the first two after 🐮 are 🕷🕷 → count 1. Then later, maybe 🕷 at position 9? No, after that, there's a 🕷 at position 7 (the seventh column) but after that comes 🦕 and another 🕷. Wait, let me look again. Row 6: the entire row is:\n\n💫, 🐮, 🕷, 🕷, 🐛, 🐜, 🦋, 🕷, 🦕, 🕷.\n\nSo the runs are:\n\n- 🕷🕷 (positions 3 and 4, assuming 0-based? Or perhaps 2 and 3 if columns are 0-9). Wait, the row is written as:\n\n💫🐮🕷🕷🐛🐜🦋🕷🦕🕷\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\n0: 💫\n\n1: 🐮\n\n2: 🕷\n\n3: 🕷\n\n4: 🐛\n\n5: 🐜\n\n6: 🦋\n\n7: 🕷\n\n8: 🦕\n\n9: 🕷\n\nSo in row 6, there's a run at positions 2-3 (two 🕷), then later positions 7,9 are 🕷 but not consecutive. So that's one run in the row → count +=1.\n\nRow 6 contributes 1.\n\nRow 7: 🦩🦩 (count 1), then 🐮, 🕷, 🐮🐮 (count another 1), then 💫, 🦩, 💫, 🕷.\n\nSo row 7 has two runs: 🦩🦩 and 🐮🐮 → total 2.\n\nRow 8: 🦋🦋 → count 1. Then 🐗, 🐮, 🐗, 🦋🦋 → count another 1. Then 🦕, 🐛🐛 → count another 1. So runs are: first two 🦋 (count 1), then two 🦋 again (positions 5-6?), and then two 🐛 at the end. So in row 8:\n\n0: 🦋\n\n1: 🦋\n\n2: 🐗\n\n3: 🐮\n\n4: 🐗\n\n5: 🦋\n\n6: 🦋\n\n7: 🦕\n\n8: 🐛\n\n9: 🐛\n\nSo runs are:\n\npositions 0-1: length 2 → count 1.\n\npositions 5-6: length 2 → count 1.\n\npositions 8-9: 🐛🐛 → count 1.\n\nSo row 8 contributes 3.\n\nRow 9: 🕷, 🐛, 🐜, 🕷, 💫, 🦩, 🐛, 🐗, 🦩, 🦋. All single emojis. No runs. So 0.\n\nSo total horizontal runs: row 0 (2) + row1 (0) + row2 (1) + row3 (2) + row4 (0) + row5 (0) + row6 (1) + row7 (2) + row8 (3) + row9 (0) → sum: 2+0+1+2+0+0+1+2+3+0= 11.\n\nNow process the vertical columns. There are 10 columns. For each column, check consecutive runs.\n\nLet's go column by column.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow 0: 🐛\n\nRow1: 🐛\n\nRow2: 🦩\n\nRow3: 🐛\n\nRow4: 🐮\n\nRow5: 💫\n\nRow6: 💫\n\nRow7: 🦩\n\nRow8: 🦋\n\nRow9: 🕷\n\nCheck vertical runs in column 0.\n\nLooking at consecutive same emojis:\n\nRow0: 🐛\n\nRow1: same 🐛 → run starts here. So run from row0-1 (two 🐛) → length 2. So this counts as one.\n\nThen row2 is 🦩 (different). So column 0 has a run of 2 → count 1.\n\nRow3 is 🐛 (same as row0-1, but after a break. So row3's 🐛 is a single. So the run in column0 is rows0-1: count 1.\n\nColumn 0: 1.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow0: 🦩\n\nRow1: 🐮\n\nRow2: 🦕\n\nRow3: 🐛\n\nRow4: 🦕\n\nRow5: 🐜\n\nRow6: 🐮\n\nRow7: 🦩\n\nRow8: 🦋\n\nRow9: 🐛\n\nNo consecutive same. So column1: 0.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: 🐮\n\nRow1: 💫\n\nRow2: 🕷\n\nRow3: 🐗\n\nRow4: 🐜\n\nRow5: 🐛\n\nRow6: 🕷\n\nRow7: 🕷\n\nRow8: 🐗\n\nRow9: 🐜\n\nCheck for same consecutive in column2.\n\nRows0: 🐮\n\nRow1: 💫 (different)\n\nRow2: 🕷 (different from row0 and 1)\n\nRow3: 🐗 (different)\n\nRow4: 🐜 (different)\n\nRow5: 🐛 (diff)\n\nRow6: 🕷 (diff from row5's 🐛)\n\nRow7: 🕷 (same as row6 → run starts here. Row6 and row7: two 🕷 → count +=1.\n\nRow8: 🐗 (diff)\n\nRow9: 🐜 (diff)\n\nSo column2 has a run of 2 (rows6-7) → count 1.\n\nColumn2: 1.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🐮\n\nRow1: 🐛\n\nRow2: 🕷\n\nRow3: 🐛\n\nRow4: 🐮\n\nRow5: 🕷\n\nRow6: 🕷\n\nRow7: 🕷\n\nRow8: 🦋\n\nRow9: 🕷\n\nLooking for vertical runs.\n\nRow0: 🐮\n\nRow1: 🐛 (diff)\n\nRow2: 🕷 (diff from row1)\n\nRow3: 🐛 (diff)\n\nRow4: 🐮 (diff)\n\nRow5: 🕷 (diff from row4)\n\nRow6: 🕷 (same as row5 → run starts here. Let's see:\n\nRow5: 🕷\n\nRow6: 🕷 → run of 2. Then row7: 🕷 → same, so run length 3 (rows5-7). So this is a single run of length 3 → count 1.\n\nRow8: 🦋 (diff)\n\nRow9: 🕷 (diff from row8, but row7 was 🕷. So from row5 to row7: 3 same, but that's one run. So column3 contributes 1.\n\nSo column3: 1.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow0: 💫\n\nRow1: 🐜\n\nRow2: 💫\n\nRow3: 🦕\n\nRow4: 🐗\n\nRow5: 🐗\n\nRow6: 🐛\n\nRow7: 🐮\n\nRow8: 🐗\n\nRow9: 💫\n\nCheck for runs.\n\nRow4: 🐗\n\nRow5: 🐗 → same → run of 2. So column4 has a run in rows4-5 → count 1.\n\nBut let's check:\n\nRow0: 💫\n\nRow1: 🐜 → different.\n\nRow2: 💫 → same as row0? No, row0 is 💫, row1 is 🐜, row2 is 💫. So row2's 💫 is after a different emoji. So no run.\n\nRow3: 🦕 (diff)\n\nRow4: 🐗\n\nRow5: 🐗 → same → run of 2. Count 1.\n\nRow6: 🐛 (diff)\n\nRow7: 🐮 (diff)\n\nRow8: 🐗 (diff)\n\nRow9: 💫 (diff)\n\nSo column4 contributes 1.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow0: 🦩\n\nRow1: 🕷\n\nRow2: 🐛\n\nRow3: 💫\n\nRow4: 🐛\n\nRow5: 🦕\n\nRow6: 🐜\n\nRow7: 🐮\n\nRow8: 🦋\n\nRow9: 🦩\n\nCheck for same consecutive.\n\nNo consecutive same in column5. All different. So 0.\n\nColumn6:\n\nRow0: 🐗\n\nRow1: 🐛\n\nRow2: 💫\n\nRow3: 🐮\n\nRow4: 🐗\n\nRow5: 🦋\n\nRow6: 🦋\n\nRow7: 💫\n\nRow8: 🦋\n\nRow9: 🐛\n\nCheck vertical runs.\n\nRow5: 🦋\n\nRow6: 🦋 → same → run of 2 → count 1.\n\nRow7: 💫 (diff)\n\nRow8: 🦋 (diff from row7)\n\nRow9: 🐛 (diff)\n\nSo column6 contributes 1.\n\nColumn7:\n\nRow0: 🐜\n\nRow1: 💫\n\nRow2: 🦕\n\nRow3: 🐜\n\nRow4: 🦕\n\nRow5: 🦕\n\nRow6: 🕷\n\nRow7: 🦩\n\nRow8: 🦕\n\nRow9: 🐗\n\nCheck vertical runs.\n\nRows4: 🦕\n\nRow5: 🦕 → same → run of 2. Count 1.\n\nSo rows4-5: 🦕🦕 → count +=1.\n\nOther rows:\n\nRow0: 🐜 → different from row1's 💫.\n\nRow2: 🦕 → different from row3's 🐜.\n\nSo column7: 1.\n\nColumn8:\n\nRow0: 🐮\n\nRow1: 🐗\n\nRow2: 🐜\n\nRow3: 🐜\n\nRow4: 🐗\n\nRow5: 🐛\n\nRow6: 🦕\n\nRow7: 💫\n\nRow8: 🐛\n\nRow9: 🦩\n\nCheck runs.\n\nRow2: 🐜\n\nRow3: 🐜 → run of 2. So rows2-3: count 1.\n\nNo other runs.\n\nColumn8: 1.\n\nColumn9:\n\nRow0: 🐮\n\nRow1: 🕷\n\nRow2: 🐮\n\nRow3: 🕷\n\nRow4: 🦕\n\nRow5: 🦋\n\nRow6: 🕷\n\nRow7: 🕷\n\nRow8: 🐛\n\nRow9: 🦋\n\nCheck runs.\n\nRow6: 🕷\n\nRow7: 🕷 → same → run of 2. So count 1.\n\nAlso, row3: 🕷, row4: 🦕 (diff), but what about row1's 🕷 and row3's 🕷? No, they are not consecutive. So only row6-7's 🕷→ count 1.\n\nSo column9: 1.\n\nNow sum all the vertical counts:\n\nColumn0: 1\n\nColumn1: 0\n\nColumn2:1\n\nColumn3:1\n\nColumn4:1\n\nColumn5:0\n\nColumn6:1\n\nColumn7:1\n\nColumn8:1\n\nColumn9:1\n\nTotal vertical: 1+0+1+1+1+0+1+1+1+1 = let's see:\n\n1 (col0) + col2 (1) =2, +col3 (1) 3, +col4 (1)4, +col6 (1)5, +col7 (1)6, +col8 (1)7, +col9 (1)8. Wait, but adding all the numbers:\n\nColumns 0 (1), 2 (1),3 (1),4 (1),6 (1),7 (1),8 (1),9 (1): that's 8.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\ncolumn0:1\n\ncolumn1:0 → sum 1.\n\ncolumn2:1 → sum 2.\n\ncolumn3:1 →3.\n\ncolumn4:1 →4.\n\ncolumn5:0 →4.\n\ncolumn6:1 →5.\n\ncolumn7:1 →6.\n\ncolumn8:1 →7.\n\ncolumn9:1 →8.\n\nYes. So vertical count is 8.\n\nTotal lines: horizontal 11 + vertical 8 = 19?\n\nWait, wait. Wait, horizontal was 2+0+1+2+0+0+1+2+3+0= 11. Vertical is 8. So total 19.\n\nBut wait, let me recheck the horizontal counts:\n\nRow0:2.\n\nRow1:0.\n\nRow2:1.\n\nRow3:2.\n\nRow4:0.\n\nRow5:0.\n\nRow6:1.\n\nRow7:2.\n\nRow8:3.\n\nRow9:0.\n\nSumming: 2+1=3, +2=5, +1=6, +2=8, +3=11. Yes, total horizontal 11.\n\nVertical columns sum to 8. So total 11+8=19.\n\nBut wait, let me recheck the vertical columns again.\n\nColumn0: rows0-1 (🐛🐛):1.\n\nColumn2: rows6-7 (🕷🕷):1.\n\nColumn3: rows5-7 (🕷🕷🕷), but in column3, rows5 is 🕷, row6 is 🕷, row7 is 🕷. That's a run of 3. So that's one count.\n\nWait, in column3:\n\nRow3's data: for column3 (index 3), which is the fourth column.\n\nRow0: 🐮 (column3 is the fourth emoji in row0? Let me confirm:\n\nRow0's emojis: 🐛🦩🐮🐮💫🦩🐗🐜🐮🐮 → columns 0-9. So column3 is the fourth emoji, which is 🐮 (the third in the list, since first is index0). Wait, no, let me list them properly:\n\nRow0: column0:🐛, column1:🦩, column2:🐮, column3:🐮, etc. Wait no. Wait, the first row is:\n\n🐛 (col0), 🦩 (col1), 🐮 (col2), 🐮 (col3), 💫 (col4), 🦩 (col5), 🐗 (col6), 🐜 (col7), 🐮 (col8), 🐮 (col9). Oh right! So each row is 10 columns, index 0 to 9.\n\nSo when processing column3, it's the fourth element in each row.\n\nSo for column3:\n\nRow0: 🐮 (col3).\n\nRow1: 🐛 (col3? Let me check row1:\n\nRow1: 🐛 (col0), 🐮 (col1), 💫 (col2), 🐛 (col3), 🐜 (col4), 🕷 (col5), 🐛 (col6), 💫 (col7), 🐗 (col8), 🕷 (col9).\n\nAh, so column3 in row1 is 🐛.\n\nSo for column3:\n\nRow0: 🐮.\n\nRow1: 🐛.\n\nRow2: 🕷 (col3 is row2's fourth emoji: row2's emojis are 🦩🦕🕷🕷💫🐛💫🦕🐜🐮 → columns 0-9. So col3 is 🕷.\n\nRow3: 🐛 (row3 is 🐛🐛🐗🐛... → col3 is 🐛.\n\nRow4: 🐮 (row4's column3: row4 is 🐮🦕🐜🐮... → col3 is 🐮.\n\nRow5: 🕷 (row5: 🕷 is column3? Let's see row5's emojis: 💫🐜🐛🕷🐗🦕🦋🦕🐛🦋 → columns 0-9. So column3 is 🕷.\n\nRow6: 🕷 (row6: 🕷 is column3? Row6: 💫🐮🕷🕷🐛🐜🦋🕷🦕🕷 → column3 is 🕷.\n\nRow7: 🕷 (row7's column3: row7's emojis are 🦩🦩🐮🕷🐮🐮💫🦩💫🕷 → column3 is 🕷.\n\nRow8: 🐗 (row8: 🦋🦋🐗🐮... → column3 is 🐮. Wait, row8's emojis: 🦋🦋🐗🐮🐗🦋🦋🦕🐛🐛. So column3 is 🐮.\n\nRow9: 🕷 (row9's column3: row9's emojis are 🕷🐛🐜🕷💫🦩🐛🐗🦩🦋 → column3 is 🕷.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me retrace.\n\nFor column3:\n\nRow0: col3 is 🐮.\n\nRow1: col3 is 🐛.\n\nRow2: col3 is 🕷.\n\nRow3: col3 is 🐛.\n\nRow4: col3 is 🐮.\n\nRow5: col3 is 🕷.\n\nRow6: col3 is 🕷.\n\nRow7: col3 is 🕷.\n\nRow8: col3 is 🐮.\n\nRow9: col3 is 🕷.\n\nSo the sequence for column3 is:\n\n🐮, 🐛, 🕷, 🐛, 🐮, 🕷, 🕷, 🕷, 🐮, 🕷.\n\nLooking for consecutive same emojis.\n\nLet's list them in order (row0 to row9):\n\nRow0: 🐮\n\nRow1: 🐛 (different from row0)\n\nRow2: 🕷 (diff from row1)\n\nRow3: 🐛 (diff from row2)\n\nRow4: 🐮 (diff from row3)\n\nRow5: 🕷 (diff from row4)\n\nRow6: 🕷 (same as row5 → start run of 2)\n\nRow7: 🕷 (same → run continues to 3)\n\nRow8: 🐮 (diff → run ends. length 3 → count 1.\n\nRow9: 🕷 (diff from row8).\n\nSo column3's vertical run is rows5-7: 🕷🕷🕷 → length 3. Which counts as one run. So column3 contributes 1.\n\nSo earlier calculation for vertical columns was correct.\n\nSo vertical columns sum to 8.\n\nThus, total answer is 11 (horizontal) +8 (vertical) =19.\n\nBut wait, let me recheck all columns:\n\nColumn0: run rows0-1 →1.\n\nColumn1: no run.\n\nColumn2: rows6-7 →1.\n\nColumn3: rows5-7 →1.\n\nColumn4: rows4-5 →1.\n\nColumn5: no run.\n\nColumn6: rows5-6 →1.\n\nColumn7: rows4-5 →1.\n\nWait, column7's vertical run was rows4-5 (🦕🦕). Let me recheck column7.\n\nColumn7:\n\nRow0: 🐜.\n\nRow1: 💫.\n\nRow2: 🦕.\n\nRow3: 🐜.\n\nRow4: 🦕.\n\nRow5: 🦕.\n\nRow6: 🕷.\n\nRow7: 🦩.\n\nRow8: 🦕.\n\nRow9: 🐗.\n\nSo rows4 and 5 are 🦕 and 🦕 → run of 2 → count 1.\n\nRows2's 🦕 is separated by row3's 🐜. So column7 contributes 1.\n\nSo yes, columns 0 (1), 2 (1), 3 (1),4 (1),6 (1),7 (1),8 (1),9 (1). Wait, column8's run.\n\nColumn8:\n\nRow0: 🐮 (row0, col8: the ninth emoji in row0 is 🐮 (since the row is 🐛🦩🐮🐮💫🦩🐗🐜🐮🐮 → col8 is 🐮.\n\nRow1: 🐗 (col8 is 🐗.\n\nRow2: 🐜 (col8 is 🐜.\n\nRow3: 🐜 (row3's col8 is 🐜.\n\nRow4: 🐗 (col8 is 🐗.\n\nRow5: 🐛 (col8 is 🐛.\n\nRow6: 🦕 (col8 is 🦕.\n\nRow7: 💫 (col8 is 💫.\n\nRow8: 🐛 (col8 is 🐛.\n\nRow9: 🦩 (col9's col8 is 🦩.\n\nSo column8's sequence:\n\n🐮, 🐗, 🐜, 🐜, 🐗, 🐛, 🦕, 💫, 🐛, 🦩.\n\nSo looking for runs here:\n\nRow2 and row3: 🐜 and 🐜 → run of 2 → count 1.\n\nSo column8 contributes 1.\n\nColumn9's run is rows6-7's 🕷 and 🕷.\n\nRow6's col9 is 🕷.\n\nRow7's col9 is 🕷.\n\nSo run of 2 → count 1.\n\nSo yes, column9 contributes 1.\n\nThus, vertical columns sum to 8.\n\nSo total answer is 11+8=19.\n\n\nAnswer: 19"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with length 2 or more on this board. Hmm. The board is provided as rows of emojis, so each row is a horizontal line. The columns would be the vertical lines. But wait, the problem says lines can be horizontal or vertical. So I need to check both directions.\n\nFirst, let's process each row for horizontal sequences. For each row, I'll look for consecutive same emojis. For example, in the first row: 🐳😁😁🦒🌝🚀🦖🌝🚀🌝. Let's check the first few. The second and third are both 😁, so that's a horizontal line of length 2. Then others are single. So in that row, there's one horizontal line. But wait, if there are more than 2 in a row, like three in a row, how does that count? The problem states lines of length 2 or more. So each such sequence contributes one line. Even if a longer sequence is present, each possible sub-sequence of 2 counts? Wait no. Wait, the question says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more.\" So a line is a single consecutive sequence. So for example, three same emojis in a row would count as one line (since the length is 3 >=2). So each such consecutive run contributes 1 line if its length is >=2. So for each row and column, I need to find all runs of same emojis, and count each run that is length 2 or longer as contributing 1 to the total.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. For each row, check each horizontal run. For each run of same emojis, if the run's length is >=2, add 1 to the count.\n2. For each column, check each vertical run. Similarly, for each vertical run of same emojis, if the run's length >=2, add 1 to the count.\n3. Sum all these counts to get the total.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So each line (horizontal or vertical) is a straight line. So each run in a row (horizontal) or column (vertical) is considered a separate line. So for example, a horizontal run of 3 same emojis would count as 1 line. Similarly for a vertical run of 2, counts as 1.\n\nSo now, let's go through each row and column.\n\nLet me start by writing out the board as a grid. Let's see the rows given:\n\nRow 1: 🐳😁😁🦒🌝🚀🦖🌝🚀🌝\nRow 2: 🧽🌝😁😁🚀🐳🚀🦒🦖🧽\nRow 3: 😁😁🐳😁🌝🦖🦜🌝🦖😁\nRow 4: 🦒🐳🌝🧽🐳🧽🌝🧽🧽🦜\nRow 5: 🧽🌹🦖🦜🐳🐳🧽🦜🧽🦒\nRow 6: 🐳🚀😁🦖😁😁🦒🦖🦖🦒\nRow 7: 🦖🚀🦒🦖🌝🌝🧽🚀🌹🚀\nRow 8: 🧽🧽🧽🧽🐳🧽🐳🚀🌝😁\nRow 9: 🌹🐳🚀🦜🦒🦜🦖🌹🌝😁\nRow 10: 🌹🦜🦜🌝🦖🦜🌹🦖🚀😁\n\nEach row is 10 emojis long. So the board is 10x10.\n\nNow, let's process each row for horizontal runs.\n\nRow 1: 🐳 | 😁😁 | 🦒 | 🌝 | 🚀 | 🦖 | 🌝 | 🚀 | 🌝\nThe consecutive same emojis here are the two 😁. So that's one horizontal line. So row 1 contributes 1.\n\nRow 2: 🧽 | 🌝 | 😁😁 | 🚀 | 🐳 | 🚀 | 🦒 | 🦖 | 🧽\nThe two 😁. So count +=1. Any others? No. So row 2 contributes 1.\n\nRow3: 😁😁 | 🐳 | 😁 | 🌝 | 🦖 | 🦜 | 🌝 | 🦖 | 😁\nThe first two 😁, then later no others. So row3 contributes 1.\n\nRow4: 🦒 | 🐳 | 🌝 | 🧽 | 🐳 | 🧽 | 🌝 | 🧽🧽 | 🦜\nThe two 🧽 at positions 8 and 9. So row4 contributes 1.\n\nRow5: 🧽 | 🌹 | 🦖 | 🦜 | 🐳🐳 | 🧽 | 🦜 | 🧽 | 🦒\nThe two 🐳 in positions 4-5. So row5 contributes 1.\n\nRow6: 🐳 | 🚀 | 😁 | 🦖 | 😁😁 | 🦒 | 🦖🦖 | 🦒\nThe two 😁 in positions 4-5, and the two 🦖 in positions 7-8. So row6 has two runs. So contributes 2.\n\nRow7: 🦖 | 🚀 | 🦒 | 🦖 | 🌝🌝 | 🧽 | 🚀 | 🌹 | 🚀\nTwo 🌝 in positions 4-5. So contributes 1.\n\nRow8: 🧽🧽🧽🧽 | 🐳 | 🧽 | 🐳 | 🚀 | 🌝 | 😁\nThe first four 🧽. Since it's a run of 4, it counts as 1. So row8 contributes 1.\n\nRow9: 🌹 | 🐳 | 🚀 | 🦜 | 🦒 | 🦜 | 🦖 | 🌹 | 🌝 | 😁\nNo consecutive same emojis. So 0.\n\nRow10: 🌹 | 🦜🦜 | 🌝 | 🦖 | 🦜 | 🌹 | 🦖 | 🚀 | 😁\nThe two 🦜 in positions 2-3. So contributes 1.\n\nSo summing horizontal contributions: 1 (row1) +1 +1 +1 +1 +2 +1 +1 +0 +1 = Let's calculate:\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:1 → total 2\n\nRow3:1 →3\n\nRow4:1 →4\n\nRow5:1 →5\n\nRow6:2 →7\n\nRow7:1 →8\n\nRow8:1 →9\n\nRow10:1 →10.\n\nWait, rows 1-10. So sum of horizontal is 1+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+0+1= let me recount:\n\nRow 1:1\n\nRow2:1 →2\n\nRow3:1 →3\n\nRow4:1 →4\n\nRow5:1 →5\n\nRow6:2 →7\n\nRow7:1 →8\n\nRow8:1 →9\n\nRow9:0 →9\n\nRow10:1 →10. So horizontal lines total 10.\n\nNow vertical lines. Need to check each column for vertical runs.\n\nEach column has 10 cells. Let's go through each column.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow1: 🐳\n\nRow2: 🧽\n\nRow3: 😁\n\nRow4: 🦒\n\nRow5: 🧽\n\nRow6: 🐳\n\nRow7: 🦖\n\nRow8: 🧽\n\nRow9: 🌹\n\nRow10: 🌹\n\nSo looking for vertical runs here. Let's check each consecutive in column 1.\n\nThe sequence is 🐳, 🧽, 😁, 🦒, 🧽, 🐳, 🦖, 🧽, 🌹, 🌹. So the last two are 🌹🌹, which is a vertical run of 2. So in column1, there's one vertical line (the last two rows). So column1 contributes 1.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow1: 😁\n\nRow2: 🌝\n\nRow3: 😁\n\nRow4: 🐳\n\nRow5: 🌹\n\nRow6: 🚀\n\nRow7: 🚀\n\nRow8: 🧽\n\nRow9: 🐳\n\nRow10: 🦜\n\nCheck for vertical runs. Let's list the column2 entries:\n\n😁, 🌝, 😁, 🐳, 🌹, 🚀, 🚀, 🧽, 🐳, 🦜.\n\nLooking for consecutive same:\n\nRow6 and row7 are 🚀 and 🚀. That's a vertical run of 2. So column2 contributes 1.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow1: 😁\n\nRow2: 😁\n\nRow3: 🐳\n\nRow4: 🌝\n\nRow5: 🦖\n\nRow6: 😁\n\nRow7: 🦒\n\nRow8: 🧽\n\nRow9: 🚀\n\nRow10: 🦜\n\nColumn3 entries:\n\n😁 (row1), 😁 (row2), 🐳 (row3), 🌝 (row4), 🦖 (row5), 😁 (row6), 🦒 (row7), 🧽 (row8), 🚀 (row9), 🦜 (row10).\n\nLooking for consecutive same. The first two entries (row1 and row2) are 😁 and 😁 → vertical run of 2. So that's one. Then, row5 and row6 are 🦖 and 😁 (different). So column3 contributes 1.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow1: 🦒\n\nRow2: 😁\n\nRow3: 😁\n\nRow4: 🧽\n\nRow5: 🦜\n\nRow6: 🦖\n\nRow7: 🦖\n\nRow8: 🧽\n\nRow9: 🦜\n\nRow10: 🌝.\n\nColumn4 entries:\n\n🦒, 😁, 😁, 🧽, 🦜, 🦖, 🦖, 🧽, 🦜, 🌝.\n\nCheck consecutive same. Row2 and 3: 😁 and 😁 → run of 2. Then row6 and 7: 🦖 and 🦖 → another run. So column4 has two vertical runs. So contributes 2.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow1: 🌝\n\nRow2: 🚀\n\nRow3: 🌝\n\nRow4: 🐳\n\nRow5: 🐳\n\nRow6: 😁\n\nRow7: 🌝\n\nRow8: 🐳\n\nRow9: 🦒\n\nRow10: 🦖.\n\nEntries: 🌝, 🚀, 🌝, 🐳, 🐳, 😁, 🌝, 🐳, 🦒, 🦖.\n\nCheck consecutive. Row4 and 5: 🐳 and 🐳 → run of 2. So that's one. So column5 contributes 1.\n\nColumn6:\n\nRow1: 🚀\n\nRow2: 🐳\n\nRow3: 🦖\n\nRow4: 🧽\n\nRow5: 🧽\n\nRow6: 😁\n\nRow7: 🌝\n\nRow8: 🧽\n\nRow9: 🦜\n\nRow10: 🦜.\n\nEntries: 🚀, 🐳, 🦖, 🧽, 🧽, 😁, 🌝, 🧽, 🦜, 🦜.\n\nRow4 and 5: 🧽 and 🧽 → run of 2. Then, row9 and 10: 🦜 and 🦜 → another run. So column6 has two runs. So contributes 2.\n\nColumn7:\n\nRow1: 🦖\n\nRow2: 🚀\n\nRow3: 🦜\n\nRow4: 🌝\n\nRow5: 🧽\n\nRow6: 🦒\n\nRow7: 🧽\n\nRow8: 🐳\n\nRow9: 🦖\n\nRow10: 🌹.\n\nEntries: 🦖, 🚀, 🦜, 🌝, 🧽, 🦒, 🧽, 🐳, 🦖, 🌹.\n\nNo consecutive same. So column7 contributes 0.\n\nColumn8:\n\nRow1: 🌝\n\nRow2: 🦒\n\nRow3: 🌝\n\nRow4: 🧽\n\nRow5: 🦜\n\nRow6: 🦖\n\nRow7: 🚀\n\nRow8: 🚀\n\nRow9: 🌹\n\nRow10: 🦖.\n\nEntries: 🌝, 🦒, 🌝, 🧽, 🦜, 🦖, 🚀, 🚀, 🌹, 🦖.\n\nRow7 and 8: 🚀 and 🚀 → run of 2. So column8 contributes 1.\n\nColumn9:\n\nRow1: 🚀\n\nRow2: 🦖\n\nRow3: 🦖\n\nRow4: 🧽\n\nRow5: 🧽\n\nRow6: 🦒\n\nRow7: 🌹\n\nRow8: 🌝\n\nRow9: 🌝\n\nRow10: 🚀.\n\nEntries: 🚀, 🦖, 🦖, 🧽, 🧽, 🦒, 🌹, 🌝, 🌝, 🚀.\n\nRow2 and 3: 🦖, 🦖 → run of 2. Row4 and 5: 🧽, 🧽 → run of 2. Row8 and 9: 🌝, 🌝 → run of 2. So three runs. So column9 contributes 3.\n\nWait, wait. Let's check the entries again:\n\nRow1: 🚀 (col9?)\n\nWait wait, columns are numbered 1-10. Let me recheck the columns. For column9, each row's ninth element.\n\nWait, each row is 10 emojis. Let's confirm the ninth element for each row:\n\nRow1: 🐳😁😁🦒🌝🚀🦖🌝🚀🌝 → ninth is 🚀.\n\nRow2: 🧽🌝😁😁🚀🐳🚀🦒🦖🧽 → ninth is 🦖.\n\nRow3: 😁😁🐳😁🌝🦖🦜🌝🦖😁 → ninth is 🦖.\n\nRow4: 🦒🐳🌝🧽🐳🧽🌝🧽🧽🦜 → ninth is 🧽.\n\nRow5: 🧽🌹🦖🦜🐳🐳🧽🦜🧽🦒 → ninth is 🧽.\n\nRow6: 🐳🚀😁🦖😁😁🦒🦖🦖🦒 → ninth is 🦖.\n\nRow7: 🦖🚀🦒🦖🌝🌝🧽🚀🌹🚀 → ninth is 🌹.\n\nRow8: 🧽🧽🧽🧽🐳🧽🐳🚀🌝😁 → ninth is 🌝.\n\nRow9: 🌹🐳🚀🦜🦒🦜🦖🌹🌝😁 → ninth is 🌝.\n\nRow10: 🌹🦜🦜🌝🦖🦜🌹🦖🚀😁 → ninth is 🚀.\n\nSo column9 entries are:\n\nRow1: 🚀\n\nRow2: 🦖\n\nRow3: 🦖\n\nRow4: 🧽\n\nRow5: 🧽\n\nRow6: 🦖\n\nRow7: 🌹\n\nRow8: 🌝\n\nRow9: 🌝\n\nRow10: 🚀.\n\nLooking for consecutive same in column9:\n\nRow1 and 2: 🚀 and 🦖 → different.\n\nRow2 and3: 🦖 and 🦖 → run of 2. So that's one.\n\nRow4 and5: 🧽 and 🧽 → run of 2. Another one.\n\nRow8 and9: 🌝 and 🌝 → run of 2. Third one.\n\nSo three runs in column9. So column9 contributes 3.\n\nColumn10:\n\nRow1: 🌝\n\nRow2: 🧽\n\nRow3: 😁\n\nRow4: 🦜\n\nRow5: 🦒\n\nRow6: 🦒\n\nRow7: 🚀\n\nRow8: 😁\n\nRow9: 😁\n\nRow10: 😁.\n\nEntries: 🌝, 🧽, 😁, 🦜, 🦒, 🦒, 🚀, 😁, 😁, 😁.\n\nCheck consecutive same:\n\nRow5 and6: 🦒 and 🦒 → run of 2. Then, row8,9,10: 😁, 😁, 😁. The run here is three consecutive (rows 8-10). So that's one run (since it's a single run of length 3). So column10 has two runs. So contributes 2.\n\nWait, let's list all column10 entries:\n\nRow1: 🌝\n\nRow2: 🧽\n\nRow3: 😁\n\nRow4: 🦜\n\nRow5: 🦒\n\nRow6: 🦒\n\nRow7: 🚀\n\nRow8: 😁\n\nRow9: 😁\n\nRow10: 😁.\n\nSo from row5 to row6: 🦒 and 🦒 → run of 2. So that's one.\n\nFrom row8 to row9 to row10: 😁, 😁, 😁 → run of 3. That's another one. So column10 contributes 2.\n\nSo now, sum all vertical contributions:\n\nColumn1:1\n\nColumn2:1 → total 2\n\nColumn3:1 →3\n\nColumn4:2 →5\n\nColumn5:1 →6\n\nColumn6:2 →8\n\nColumn7:0 →8\n\nColumn8:1 →9\n\nColumn9:3 →12\n\nColumn10:2 →14.\n\nSo vertical lines total 14.\n\nNow total lines is horizontal (10) + vertical (14) → 24. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me recheck the vertical counts.\n\nLet me recheck column9:\n\nEntries are:\n\nRow1: 🚀 (col9)\n\nRow2: 🦖\n\nRow3: 🦖\n\nRow4: 🧽\n\nRow5: 🧽\n\nRow6: 🦖\n\nRow7: 🌹\n\nRow8: 🌝\n\nRow9: 🌝\n\nRow10: 🚀.\n\nSo the runs:\n\nRow2 and 3: 🦖, 🦖 → run of 2 (count 1).\n\nRow4 and5: 🧽, 🧽 → run (count 2).\n\nRow8 and9: 🌝, 🌝 → run (count 3). So column9 contributes 3. Yes.\n\nColumn10's runs:\n\nRow5-6: 🦒, 🦒 →1.\n\nRow8-10: 😁, 😁, 😁 →1 run of length 3. So that's 1. So total 2 runs for column10. So 2.\n\nSo vertical total is 1+1+1+2+1+2+0+1+3+2= Let's add:\n\nColumn1:1\n\nColumn2:1 → 2\n\nColumn3:1 →3\n\nColumn4:2 →5\n\nColumn5:1 →6\n\nColumn6:2 →8\n\nColumn7:0 →8\n\nColumn8:1 →9\n\nColumn9:3 →12\n\nColumn10:2 →14. So vertical sum is 14.\n\nHorizontal sum was 10. Total 24.\n\nBut wait, let me recheck the horizontal counts again. Let's go through each row again.\n\nRow1: 🐳😁😁🦒🌝🚀🦖🌝🚀🌝 → two 😁 → 1.\n\nRow2: 🧽🌝😁😁🚀🐳🚀🦒🦖🧽 → two 😁 →1.\n\nRow3: 😁😁🐳😁🌝🦖🦜🌝🦖😁 → first two 😁 →1.\n\nRow4: 🦒🐳🌝🧽🐳🧽🌝🧽🧽🦜 → two 🧽 at the end (positions 8-9) →1.\n\nRow5: 🧽🌹🦖🦜🐳🐳🧽🦜🧽🦒 → two 🐳 →1.\n\nRow6: 🐳🚀😁🦖😁😁🦒🦖🦖🦒 → two 😁 and two 🦖 →2.\n\nRow7: 🦖🚀🦒🦖🌝🌝🧽🚀🌹🚀 → two 🌝 →1.\n\nRow8: 🧽🧽🧽🧽🐳🧽🐳🚀🌝😁 → four 🧽 at start →1.\n\nRow9: 🌹🐳🚀🦜🦒🦜🦖🌹🌝😁 → no runs →0.\n\nRow10: 🌹🦜🦜🌝🦖🦜🌹🦖🚀😁 → two 🦜 →1.\n\nYes, horizontal sum is 10. Vertical sum is 14. Total 24. So the answer should be 24. But perhaps I made a mistake in counting somewhere. Let me check another possible error.\n\nWait, in row6, the two 🦖 are positions 7 and 8 (0-based or 1-based? Probably 1-based. Let me recheck row6:\n\nRow6: 🐳🚀😁🦖😁😁🦒🦖🦖🦒 → positions 7 and 8 are 🦖 and 🦖. So yes, that's a run of two. So that's two runs in row6: the 😁😁 and the 🦖🦖. So that counts as 2.\n\nRow8: four 🧽 in a row. That's a single run of 4, counts as 1.\n\nIn vertical column9, three runs, that's correct.\n\nAnother possible error: column4 vertical. Let's recheck column4:\n\nRow1: 🦒 (column4)\n\nRow2: 😁\n\nRow3: 😁\n\nRow4: 🧽\n\nRow5: 🦜\n\nRow6: 🦖\n\nRow7: 🦖\n\nRow8: 🧽\n\nRow9: 🦜\n\nRow10: 🌝.\n\nAh, row2 and 3 are 😁 and 😁 → run of 2. Then row6 and7 are 🦖 and 🦖 → another run. So two runs. Yes. So column4 contributes 2.\n\nColumn6: row4 and5 are 🧽 and 🧽. Row9 and10 are 🦜 and 🦜. So two runs. Correct.\n\nAnother check: column10 vertical.\n\nRows 5 and6: 🦒🦒 → run 1.\n\nRows8,9,10: 😁😁😁 → run of 3 (counts as 1). So total 2.\n\nSo vertical sum is indeed 14.\n\nSo total is 10 +14 =24. So the answer is 24.\n\n\nThe task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more on a 10x10 grid. \n\n**Horizontal Lines Analysis:**\n- **Row 1**: 🐳 | 😁😁 | ... → 1 line.\n- **Row 2**: ... | 😁😁 | ... → 1 line.\n- **Row 3**: 😁😁 | ... → 1 line.\n- **Row 4**: ... | 🧽🧽 | ... → 1 line.\n- **Row 5**: ... | 🐳🐳 | ... → 1 line.\n- **Row 6**: ... | 😁😁 | 🦖🦖 | ... → 2 lines.\n- **Row 7**: ... | 🌝🌝 | ... → 1 line.\n- **Row 8**: 🧽🧽🧽🧽 | ... → 1 line.\n- **Row 10**: ... | 🦜🦜 | ... → 1 line.  \n**Total Horizontal Lines**: 10.\n\n**Vertical Lines Analysis:**\n- **Column 1**: 🌹🌹 (last two rows) → 1 line.\n- **Column 2**: 🚀🚀 (rows 6-7) → 1 line.\n- **Column 3**: 😁😁 (rows 1-2) → 1 line.\n- **Column 4**: 😁😁 (rows 2-3) and 🦖🦖 (rows 6-7) → 2 lines.\n- **Column 5**: 🐳🐳 (rows 4-5) → 1 line.\n- **Column 6**: 🧽🧽 (rows 4-5) and 🦜🦜 (rows 9-10) → 2 lines.\n- **Column 8**: 🚀🚀 (rows 7-8) → 1 line.\n- **Column 9**: 🦖🦖 (rows 2-3), 🧽🧽 (rows 4-5), 🌝🌝 (rows 8-9) → 3 lines.\n- **Column 10**: 🦒🦒 (rows 5-6) and 😁😁😁 (rows 8-10) → 2 lines.  \n**Total Vertical Lines**: 14.\n\n**Final Calculation**:  \nHorizontal Lines (10) + Vertical Lines (14) = **24**.\n\nAnswer: 24"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

So, the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more on the given board. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what constitutes a line here. A line can be horizontal (same row) or vertical (same column). Each line must be made up of the same emoji, and the length has to be at least 2. But wait, do sequences longer than 2 count as multiple lines? Like, a sequence of 3 same emojis in a row would count as two lines (length 2 and 3?), or just one line of length 3? I think the problem statement says to count each possible line of length 2 or more. Wait, maybe not. Let me re-read the problem.\n\nThe problem says: \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So, each individual line. But how are overlapping lines counted? For example, in a sequence of three same emojis horizontally, like AAA, that's a line of length 3. But does that count as one line (since the entire sequence is three, which is longer than 2) or as two possible lines (positions 1-2 and 2-3)? The problem statement probably counts each maximal consecutive sequence once. Wait, but maybe it's the other way. Like, any consecutive run of two or more counts as one line, regardless of its length. So a run of 4 same emojis in a row would be counted as one line. Because the question says \"a length of 2 or more\". So each consecutive run (maximal) in a row or column contributes 1 to the total count if its length is >=2.\n\nWait, but that's an important point. Let me check. For example, in the row: A A A. Then, the horizontal line here would be counted once, as a single line of length 3. So regardless of how many possible sub-lines of length 2 it contains, the entire run counts as one line. So the count is per maximal consecutive sequence in each direction. So the approach is to scan each row for runs (horizontal) and each column for runs (vertical), then sum all those runs that have a length of at least 2. Each run (maximal sequence) is counted once, even if it's longer than 2.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Otherwise, if a run of 3 would count as two lines (two possible pairs), but the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". So each run of 3 would count as one line. So for each row, we need to check consecutive elements and group them into runs. Similarly for columns.\n\nSo the steps to solve the problem would be:\n\n1. Iterate over each row and find all horizontal runs (consecutive same emojis).\n2. For each of these runs, if the length is >=2, add 1 to the count.\n3. Then, iterate over each column and do the same for vertical runs.\n4. Sum all these counts from rows and columns to get the total.\n\nBut wait, but in rows and columns, each run in horizontal direction (row) is separate from vertical. So for example, a run of 3 in a row and a run of 2 in the same row but overlapping might be considered. But the process is to check rows first, then columns.\n\nNow, let's think about how to process the given board. The board is given as 7 lines, each line representing a row, and each row has 7 emojis. So it's a 7x7 grid.\n\nFirst, processing each row. For each row, we need to find consecutive sequences. Let's take the first row as an example:\n\nRow 1: 🐍💥🐢🐭🐭🌑🌑\n\nLooking at the emojis:\n\nPositions 0 to 6:\n\n0: 🐍\n\n1: 💥\n\n2: 🐢\n\n3: 🐭\n\n4: 🐭\n\n5: 🌑\n\n6: 🌑\n\nSo, let's check the runs here:\n\n- 🐍 (1) → single, so no.\n\n- 💥 (1) → no.\n\n- 🐢 (1) → no.\n\n- 🐭 starts at 3, then 4 → run of 2.\n\n- 🌑 starts at 5, 6 → run of 2.\n\nSo in this row, there are two horizontal runs of length 2 each. So that contributes 2 to the horizontal count.\n\nRow 2: 🐍🐭💥🐍🐭💥🐭\n\nLooking at this row:\n\n0: 🐍\n\n1: 🐭\n\n2: 💥\n\n3: 🐍\n\n4: 🐭\n\n5: 💥\n\n6: 🐭\n\nSo the runs here:\n\nEach emoji is single, no consecutive same. So no horizontal runs here. So contributes 0.\n\nRow 3: 🐍🐭🐢🐭🐍🐍🐍\n\nEmojis:\n\n0: 🐍\n\n1: 🐭\n\n2: 🐢\n\n3: 🐭\n\n4: 🐍\n\n5: 🐍\n\n6: 🐍\n\nRuns here:\n\n- 🐍 at 4,5,6 → run of 3. So that's one.\n\nSo this row contributes 1.\n\nRow 4: 🐍🌑💥💥🌿🐍🌑\n\nEmojis:\n\n0: 🐍\n\n1: 🌑\n\n2: 💥\n\n3: 💥\n\n4: 🌿\n\n5: 🐍\n\n6: 🌑\n\nRuns here:\n\nAt positions 2-3: 💥💥 → run of 2. So contributes 1.\n\nRow5: 🐢🐢🐭🌿🌑🌑🐢\n\nRow5:\n\n0: 🐢\n\n1: 🐢\n\n2: 🐭\n\n3: 🌿\n\n4: 🌑\n\n5: 🌑\n\n6: 🐢\n\nRuns:\n\n0-1: 🐢🐢 → 2.\n\n4-5: 🌑🌑 → 2.\n\nSo two runs → contributes 2.\n\nRow6: 🌑🐢🐭🐢💥🌑🐭\n\nRow6:\n\n0: 🌑\n\n1: 🐢\n\n2: 🐭\n\n3: 🐢\n\n4: 💥\n\n5: 🌑\n\n6: 🐭\n\nNo consecutive same emojis. So 0.\n\nRow7: 🌑🌿🌿🐭💥💥🐭\n\nWait, but the input has 7 rows. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the given board is 7 rows, each with 7 elements. So rows 0 to 6.\n\nRow 6 (the 7th row): 🌑🌿🌿🐭💥💥🐭\n\nLooking at this row:\n\n0: 🌑\n\n1: 🌿\n\n2: 🌿\n\n3: 🐭\n\n4: 💥\n\n5: 💥\n\n6: 🐭\n\nRuns here:\n\n1-2: 🌿🌿 → 2.\n\n4-5: 💥💥 → 2.\n\nSo two runs. So contributes 2.\n\nSo total horizontal runs:\n\nRow 1: 2\n\nRow 2: 0\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:2\n\nRow6:0\n\nRow7:2\n\nWait, the rows are numbered as 0-based? Let me recount.\n\nThe initial input:\n\nLine 1: row 0: 2 runs (🐭🐭 and 🌑🌑)\n\nLine 2: row 1: 0 runs.\n\nLine3: row2: 1 run (🐍🐍🐍)\n\nLine4: row3: 1 run (💥💥)\n\nLine5: row4: 2 runs (🐢🐢 and 🌑🌑)\n\nLine6: row5:0 runs.\n\nLine7: row6: 2 runs (🌿🌿 and 💥💥)\n\nSo sum horizontal runs: 2+0+1+1+2+0+2 = 8.\n\nNow, moving to vertical columns. There are 7 columns (0-6), each with 7 rows.\n\nFor each column, check consecutive emojis in vertical direction.\n\nLet's process each column:\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRows 0-6, column 0:\n\nRow0: 🐍\n\nRow1: 🐍\n\nRow2: 🐍\n\nRow3: 🐍\n\nRow4: 🐢\n\nRow5: 🌑\n\nRow6: 🌑\n\nSo the sequence is 🐍, 🐍, 🐍, 🐍, 🐢, 🌑, 🌑.\n\nLooking for vertical runs:\n\nFirst four 🐍 in a row: run length 4.\n\nThen 🐢 (single), then 🌑, 🌑 (run of 2).\n\nSo in column0, there are two vertical runs: the 4-length 🐍 (counts once) and the 2-length 🌑.\n\nSo that's two contributions.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow0: 💥\n\nRow1: 🐭\n\nRow2: 🐭\n\nRow3: 🌑\n\nRow4: 🐢\n\nRow5: 🐢\n\nRow6: 🌿\n\nSequence: 💥, 🐭, 🐭, 🌑, 🐢, 🐢, 🌿.\n\nRuns:\n\nRow1-2: 🐭🐭 → 2 → contributes 1.\n\nRow4-5: 🐢🐢 → 2 → contributes 1.\n\nSo column1 has 2 vertical runs.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: 🐢\n\nRow1: 💥\n\nRow2: 🐢\n\nRow3: 💥\n\nRow4: 🐭\n\nRow5: 🐭\n\nRow6: 🌿\n\nSequence: 🐢, 💥, 🐢, 💥, 🐭, 🐭, 🌿.\n\nRuns: row4-5: 🐭🐭 → 2 → contributes 1.\n\nSo column2: 1 run.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🐭\n\nRow1: 🐍\n\nRow2: 🐭\n\nRow3: 💥\n\nRow4: 🌿\n\nRow5: 🐢\n\nRow6: 🐭\n\nSequence: 🐭, 🐍, 🐭, 💥, 🌿, 🐢, 🐭.\n\nAll individual, no consecutive same. So no runs here. So column3 contributes 0.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow0: 🐭\n\nRow1: 🐭\n\nRow2: 🐍\n\nRow3: 🌿\n\nRow4: 🌑\n\nRow5: 💥\n\nRow6: 💥\n\nSequence: 🐭, 🐭, 🐍, 🌿, 🌑, 💥, 💥.\n\nRuns:\n\nRow0-1: 🐭🐭 → 2 → contributes 1.\n\nRow5-6: 💥💥 → 2 → contributes 1.\n\nTotal for column4: 2.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow0: 🌑\n\nRow1: 💥\n\nRow2: 🐍\n\nRow3: 🐍\n\nRow4: 🌑\n\nRow5: 🌑\n\nRow6: 💥\n\nSequence: 🌑, 💥, 🐍, 🐍, 🌑, 🌑, 💥.\n\nRuns:\n\nRow2-3: 🐍🐍 → 2 → 1.\n\nRow4-5: 🌑🌑 → 2 → 1.\n\nTotal: 2.\n\nColumn6:\n\nRow0: 🌑\n\nRow1: 🐭\n\nRow2: 🐍\n\nRow3: 🌑\n\nRow4: 🐢\n\nRow5: 🐭\n\nRow6: 🐭\n\nSequence: 🌑, 🐭, 🐍, 🌑, 🐢, 🐭, 🐭.\n\nRuns:\n\nRow5-6: 🐭🐭 → 2 → 1.\n\nSo column6 contributes 1.\n\nNow, summing the vertical runs:\n\nColumn0: 2\n\nColumn1: 2\n\nColumn2:1\n\nColumn3:0\n\nColumn4:2\n\nColumn5:2\n\nColumn6:1\n\nTotal vertical runs: 2+2+1+0+2+2+1= 10.\n\nSo total lines: horizontal 8 + vertical 10 = 18.\n\nWait, but let me check all the columns again carefully, as I may have made a mistake.\n\nLet me recheck each column.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nEmojis are:\n\nRow0: 🐍\n\nRow1: 🐍\n\nRow2: 🐍\n\nRow3: 🐍\n\nRow4: 🐢\n\nRow5: 🌑\n\nRow6: 🌑\n\nSo the runs here are:\n\n4 consecutive 🐍 from rows 0-3. So run length 4 → contributes 1.\n\nThen, rows 4: 🐢 (single).\n\nRows 5-6: 🌑🌑 → run of 2 → contributes 1.\n\nTotal 2. Correct.\n\nColumn1:\n\nEmojis:\n\nRow0: 💥\n\nRow1: 🐭\n\nRow2: 🐭\n\nRow3: 🌑\n\nRow4: 🐢\n\nRow5: 🐢\n\nRow6: 🌿\n\nRuns:\n\nRow1-2: 🐭🐭 → 2 → 1.\n\nRow4-5: 🐢🐢 → 2 → 1.\n\nYes, two runs.\n\nColumn2:\n\nEmojis:\n\nRow0: 🐢\n\nRow1: 💥\n\nRow2: 🐢\n\nRow3: 💥\n\nRow4: 🐭\n\nRow5: 🐭\n\nRow6: 🌿\n\nRuns:\n\nRows4-5: 🐭🐭 → 2 → 1.\n\nCorrect.\n\nColumn3:\n\nEmojis:\n\nRow0: 🐭\n\nRow1: 🐍\n\nRow2: 🐭\n\nRow3: 💥\n\nRow4: 🌿\n\nRow5: 🐢\n\nRow6: 🐭\n\nNo consecutive same. So 0.\n\nColumn4:\n\nEmojis:\n\nRow0: 🐭\n\nRow1: 🐭\n\nRow2: 🐍\n\nRow3: 🌿\n\nRow4: 🌑\n\nRow5: 💥\n\nRow6: 💥\n\nRuns:\n\nRow0-1: 🐭🐭 → 2 → 1.\n\nRow5-6: 💥💥 → 2 → 1.\n\nTotal 2.\n\nColumn5:\n\nEmojis:\n\nRow0: 🌑\n\nRow1: 💥\n\nRow2: 🐍\n\nRow3: 🐍\n\nRow4: 🌑\n\nRow5: 🌑\n\nRow6: 💥\n\nRuns:\n\nRow2-3: 🐍🐍 → 2 → 1.\n\nRow4-5: 🌑🌑 → 2 → 1.\n\nTotal 2.\n\nColumn6:\n\nEmojis:\n\nRow0: 🌑\n\nRow1: 🐭\n\nRow2: 🐍\n\nRow3: 🌑\n\nRow4: 🐢\n\nRow5: 🐭\n\nRow6: 🐭\n\nRuns:\n\nRow5-6: 🐭🐭 → 2 → 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo vertical total is 2+2+1+0+2+2+1= 10.\n\nHorizontal total was 8.\n\nSo 8+10=18.\n\nSo the answer should be 18. Let me check again to make sure I didn't miss any runs.\n\nWait, let me recheck the rows for horizontal runs.\n\nRow0: 🐍💥🐢🐭🐭🌑🌑 → runs are 🐭🐭 and 🌑🌑 → 2.\n\nRow1: 🐍🐭💥🐍🐭💥🐭 → no runs.\n\nRow2: 🐍🐭🐢🐭🐍🐍🐍 → the last three 🐍s. So run of 3 → 1.\n\nRow3: 🐍🌑💥💥🌿🐍🌑 → 💥💥 → 1.\n\nRow4: 🐢🐢🐭🌿🌑🌑🐢 → runs are 🐢🐢 and 🌑🌑 → 2.\n\nRow5: 🌑🐢🐭🐢💥🌑🐭 → no runs.\n\nRow6: 🌑🌿🌿🐭💥💥🐭 → 🌿🌿 and 💥💥 → 2.\n\nSo 2+0+1+1+2+0+2 = 8. Correct.\n\nVertical: 10. So 8+10=18.\n\nHmm.

Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The board is a 10x10 grid of emojis (since there are 10 rows and each row has 10 emojis). I need to check every possible horizontal line and every possible vertical line. A line here means consecutive same emojis. For each line, if its length is 2 or more, it contributes to the count. But wait, the problem states \"lines formed by the same emoji\". So, each line is a sequence of the same emoji. But how do they count overlapping sequences?\n\nWait, for example, in a horizontal row like 🐰🐰🐰, how many lines are there? The possible sequences here would be of length 3. But according to the problem, each line (of length >=2) counts. So, the same emojis in a row contribute multiple lines. Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again. If a horizontal row has four same emojis in a row, like AAAA, then the possible lines are:\n\nLength 2: positions 0-1, 1-2, 2-3 → three lines.\n\nLength 3: positions 0-2, 1-3 → two lines.\n\nLength 4: positions 0-3 → one line.\n\nBut the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji\" with length 2 or more. Wait, maybe the problem counts each maximal line. Like, the longest possible consecutive sequence. For example, in a row of AAAA, it's considered as a single line of length 4. But the problem isn't clear. Hmm, the problem statement says \"the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So, each maximal consecutive sequence of the same emoji in a row (horizontal or vertical) counts as one line. So, for example, in the row AAAA, there's one line of length 4. If the row is AAABBB, then there are two lines: AA (length 2) and BBB (length 3). Wait, no. Wait, the entire consecutive same emojis. So, AAABBB would be split into two lines: AAA (length 3) and BBB (length 3). So each such maximal consecutive sequence counts as one line if the length is >=2. So the problem is asking for the count of all such maximal lines in horizontal and vertical directions.\n\nSo the approach should be:\n\n1. For each row, check each horizontal sequence of the same emoji. Split the row into runs of the same emoji. For each run of length >=2, add 1 to the count.\n\n2. Do the same for each column: check each vertical sequence. For each run of same emoji with length >=2, add 1 to the count.\n\nSo the total number is the sum of all horizontal runs (each of length >=2) and all vertical runs (each of length >=2).\n\nSo the steps I need to do are:\n\na. Process each row, find the runs of same emojis.\n\nb. For each run in a row, if its length is 2 or more, count it.\n\nc. Do the same for each column.\n\nNow, how to implement this. Well, since I'm doing this manually, I need to go through each row and column and identify the runs.\n\nLet me start with the given board. Let's look at the first row:\n\nRow 0: 🐰🐳🐘🦂🦂🌘🐆🐬🐆🐬\n\nLooking for consecutive same emojis. Let's list them:\n\nPosition 0: 🐰 (current run starts at 0, current emoji is 🐰)\n\nPosition 1: 🐳. Different from previous. So run from 0-0 (length 1) → no count. New run starts at 1 (🐳, length 1).\n\nPosition 2: 🐘. Different. Run ends at 1 (length 1). New run starts at 2 (🐘, length 1).\n\nPosition 3: 🦂. Different. Run ends (length 1). New run starts at 3 (🦂, length 1).\n\nPosition 4: 🦂. Same as previous. Length becomes 2. So run from 3-4 (length 2). So this counts as 1.\n\nPosition 5: 🌘. Different. So the previous run (positions 3-4, length 2) is added. Now new run starts at 5 (🌘, length 1).\n\nPosition 6: 🐆. Different. Previous run (5-5, length 1). New run at 6 (🐆, length 1).\n\nPosition 7: 🐬. Different. Previous run (6-6, length 1). New run at 7 (🐬, length 1).\n\nPosition 8: 🐆. Different. Previous run (7-7, length 1). New run at 8 (🐆, length 1).\n\nPosition 9: 🐬. Different. Previous run (8-8, length 1). New run (9, 🐬, length 1).\n\nSo in row 0, the horizontal runs of length >=2 are only the run 🦂🦂 (positions 3-4). So that's +1.\n\nNow row 1:\n\nRow 1: 🐳🐳🥀🌘🐰🥀🌘🐻🐘🐬\n\nCheck consecutive runs.\n\nPositions 0-1: 🐳🐳 → run length 2. So count +1.\n\nPositions 1-2: different, so run ends. Then next runs:\n\nAt position 2: 🥀, length 1.\n\nPosition3: 🌘, different. So run ends.\n\nPosition4: 🐰. Different.\n\nPosition5: 🥀. Different.\n\nPosition6: 🌘. Different.\n\nPosition7: 🐻. Different.\n\nPosition8: 🐘. Different.\n\nPosition9: 🐬. So in this row, only the first two (🐳🐳) contribute. So row 1 adds +1.\n\nRow 2: 🐰🐬🦂🐏🐘🐆🐳🐻🥀🐏\n\nCheck runs.\n\nLooking for consecutive same:\n\n0: 🐰, next is 🐬 (diff). Run length 1.\n\n1: 🐬, next is 🦂 (diff). Run 1.\n\n2: 🦂 → next is 🐏. Diff. Run 1.\n\n3: 🐏 → next is 🐘. Diff.\n\n4: 🐘 → next is 🐆. Diff.\n\n5: 🐆 → next is 🐳. Diff.\n\n6: 🐳 → next is 🐻. Diff.\n\n7: 🐻 → next is 🥀. Diff.\n\n8: 🥀 → next is 🐏. Diff.\n\nSo no runs of length >=2. So row 2 adds 0.\n\nRow 3: 🐆🐘🌘🐘🐻🐏🥀🐘🥀🌘\n\nCheck runs:\n\nPositions 0: 🐆, next is 🐘 → different. Run 1.\n\n1: 🐘, next is 🌘 → different.\n\n2: 🌘 → next is 🐘. Different.\n\n3: 🐘 → next is 🐻. Different.\n\n4: 🐻 → next is 🐏. Different.\n\n5: 🐏 → next is 🥀. Different.\n\n6: 🥀 → next is 🐘. Different.\n\n7: 🐘 → next is 🥀. Different.\n\n8: 🥀 → next is 🌘. Different.\n\nSo no runs of length >=2. So row 3 adds 0.\n\nRow4: 🐘🐰🐬🐬🐳🐆🐻🌘🌘🐰\n\nCheck consecutive runs:\n\n0: 🐘 → next is 🐰. Diff.\n\n1: 🐰 → next is 🐬. Diff.\n\n2: 🐬 → next is 🐬. Same. So run starts at 2. Next position (3) is 🐬 as well? Wait row4:\n\nRow4: positions 0: 🐘, 1: 🐰, 2: 🐬, 3: 🐬, 4: 🐳, 5: 🐆, 6: 🐻,7:🌘,8:🌘,9: 🐰.\n\nSo at position 2 and 3: 🐬🐬 → run length 2. So count +1.\n\nAt positions 7 and8: 🌘🌘 → run length 2. Count +1.\n\nSo row4 contributes 2.\n\nSo row4 adds +2.\n\nRow5: 🥀🐰🐘🐻🐘🌘🐰🐏🥀🐏\n\nCheck runs:\n\nLooking at each consecutive pair.\n\n0: 🥀 next is 🐰. Different.\n\n1: 🐰 → next is 🐘. Different.\n\n2: 🐘 → next is 🐻. Different.\n\n3: 🐻 → next is 🐘. Different.\n\n4: 🐘 → next is 🌘. Different.\n\n5: 🌘 → next is 🐰. Different.\n\n6: 🐰 → next is 🐏. Different.\n\n7: 🐏 → next is 🥀. Different.\n\n8: 🥀 → next is 🐏. Different.\n\nSo no runs of >=2. So row5 adds 0.\n\nRow6: 🦂🐘🦂🌘🐏🐆🐰🐰🥀🐳\n\nCheck consecutive runs:\n\nAt positions 6 and7: 🐰🐰 → run length 2. Count +1.\n\nSo row6 contributes 1.\n\nRow7: 🐰🐆🐻🐻🐏🐆🐻🌘🌘🐻\n\nCheck for runs:\n\nPosition2-3: 🐻🐻 → run length 2. Count +1.\n\nPositions7-8: 🌘🌘 → run length 2. Count +1.\n\nPosition9: 🐻, but the previous is 🌘 (position8 was 🌘). So no.\n\nAlso, in row7:\n\nLooking at each consecutive:\n\n0: 🐰 next 🐆 → different.\n\n1: 🐆 next 🐻 → different.\n\n2: 🐻 next 🐻 → same. So run starts at 2. Then position3 is 🐻. So run 2-3 → length 2.\n\n3's next is 🐏 (position4). So that's a run of 2, count +1.\n\nThen position7 and8: 🌘🌘 → same. Run length 2, +1.\n\nSo row7 has two runs: 🐻🐻 and 🌘🌘. So total +2.\n\nRow8: 🐏🐆🐬🥀🐻🦂🌘🐏🐏🐆\n\nCheck runs:\n\nLooking for consecutive same.\n\nAt positions7-8: 🐏🐏 → run length 2. So count +1.\n\nRow8 adds 1.\n\nRow9: 🥀🐬🥀🐰🦂🐻🐬🐆🥀🐏\n\nCheck consecutive runs:\n\nNo two same in a row. So row9 adds 0.\n\nNow, summing all the horizontal runs:\n\nRow0:1, row1:1, row2:0, row3:0, row4:2, row5:0, row6:1, row7:2, row8:1, row9:0 → total horizontal lines = 1+1+0+0+2+0+1+2+1+0= 8.\n\nNow, check the vertical lines. For vertical lines, each column is checked from top to bottom, looking for runs of same emojis. Each vertical run of same emoji, length >=2 counts as 1.\n\nSo there are 10 columns (columns 0-9). Need to check each column.\n\nLet me go column by column.\n\nColumn0:\n\nRows 0-9, column0.\n\nRow0: 🐰\n\nRow1: 🐳\n\nRow2: 🐰\n\nRow3: 🐆\n\nRow4: 🐘\n\nRow5: 🥀\n\nRow6: 🦂\n\nRow7: 🐰\n\nRow8: 🐏\n\nRow9: 🥀\n\nSo the column0 emojis: 🐰, 🐳, 🐰, 🐆, 🐘, 🥀, 🦂, 🐰, 🐏, 🥀.\n\nCheck consecutive runs in the vertical direction. So each run is a group of same emojis in a row vertically.\n\nSo for column0:\n\nLooking for runs. Let's list them:\n\nRow0: 🐰 → check if next is same.\n\nRow0 and row1: 🐰 vs 🐳 → different. So run length 1.\n\nRow1: 🐳 → next is row2 🐰 → different. Run length 1.\n\nRow2: 🐰 → next is row3 🐆 → different. Run length 1.\n\nRow3: 🐆 → next row4 🐘 → different. Run length 1.\n\nRow4: 🐘 → next row5 🥀 → different. Run 1.\n\nRow5: 🥀 → next row6 🦂 → different. Run 1.\n\nRow6: 🦂 → next row7 🐰 → different. Run1.\n\nRow7: 🐰 → next row8 🐏 → different. Run1.\n\nRow8: 🐏 → next row9 🥀 → different. Run1.\n\nSo no vertical runs of >=2 in column0. So count 0.\n\nColumn1:\n\nColumn1: check each row's column1.\n\nRow0 column1: 🐳\n\nRow1: 🐳\n\nRow2: 🐬\n\nRow3: 🐘\n\nRow4: 🐰\n\nRow5: 🐰\n\nRow6: 🐘\n\nRow7: 🐆\n\nRow8: 🐆\n\nRow9: 🐬\n\nSo the sequence is: 🐳, 🐳, 🐬, 🐘, 🐰, 🐰, 🐘, 🐆, 🐆, 🐬.\n\nCheck runs:\n\nRow0 and 1: both 🐳. So run from row0-1 (length 2). Count +1.\n\nThen row1 (🐳) and row2 (🐬) are different. So that run ends.\n\nNext runs:\n\nRow2 (🐬) → row3 (🐘) → different.\n\nRow3 (🐘) → row4 (🐰) → different.\n\nRow4 (🐰) and row5 (🐰) → same. Run length 2. Count +1.\n\nRow5 (🐰) and row6 (🐘) → different. Run ends.\n\nRow6 (🐘) → row7 (🐆) → different.\n\nRow7 (🐆) and row8 (🐆) → same. Run length 2. Count +1.\n\nRow8 (🐆) and row9 (🐬) → different.\n\nSo column1 has three vertical runs: rows0-1, rows4-5, rows7-8. So +3.\n\nSo column1 contributes 3.\n\nColumn2:\n\nCheck each row's column2.\n\nRow0: 🐘\n\nRow1: 🥀\n\nRow2: 🦂\n\nRow3: 🌘\n\nRow4: 🐬\n\nRow5: 🐘\n\nRow6: 🦂\n\nRow7: 🐻\n\nRow8: 🐬\n\nRow9: 🥀\n\nSequence: 🐘, 🥀, 🦂, 🌘, 🐬, 🐘, 🦂, 🐻, 🐬, 🥀.\n\nLooking for vertical runs. All adjacent pairs are different. So no runs. So column2 contributes 0.\n\nColumn3:\n\nCheck each row's column3.\n\nRow0: 🦂\n\nRow1: 🌘\n\nRow2: 🐏\n\nRow3: 🐘\n\nRow4: 🐬\n\nRow5: 🐻\n\nRow6: 🌘\n\nRow7: 🐻\n\nRow8: 🥀\n\nRow9: 🐰\n\nSequence: 🦂, 🌘, 🐏, 🐘, 🐬, 🐻, 🌘, 🐻, 🥀, 🐰.\n\nNo consecutive same. So column3 contributes 0.\n\nColumn4:\n\nCheck column4.\n\nRow0: 🦂\n\nRow1: 🐰\n\nRow2: 🐘\n\nRow3: 🐻\n\nRow4: 🐳\n\nRow5: 🐘\n\nRow6: 🐏\n\nRow7: 🐏\n\nRow8: 🐻\n\nRow9: 🦂\n\nSequence: 🦂, 🐰, 🐘, 🐻, 🐳, 🐘, 🐏, 🐏, 🐻, 🦂.\n\nCheck runs:\n\nRow6-7: 🐏🐏 → run length 2. Count +1.\n\nOther pairs: different.\n\nSo column4 contributes +1.\n\nColumn5:\n\nCheck column5.\n\nRow0: 🌘\n\nRow1: 🥀\n\nRow2: 🐆\n\nRow3: 🐏\n\nRow4: 🐆\n\nRow5: 🌘\n\nRow6: 🐆\n\nRow7: 🐆\n\nRow8: 🦂\n\nRow9: 🐻\n\nSequence: 🌘, 🥀, 🐆, 🐏, 🐆, 🌘, 🐆, 🐆, 🦂, 🐻.\n\nCheck runs:\n\nRow4-5: 🐆 vs 🌘 (different).\n\nRows6-7: 🐆🐆 → run length 2. Count +1.\n\nSo column5 contributes 1.\n\nColumn6:\n\nCheck column6.\n\nRow0: 🐆\n\nRow1: 🌘\n\nRow2: 🐳\n\nRow3: 🥀\n\nRow4: 🐻\n\nRow5: 🐰\n\nRow6: 🐰\n\nRow7: 🐻\n\nRow8: 🌘\n\nRow9: 🐬\n\nSequence: 🐆, 🌘, 🐳, 🥀, 🐻, 🐰, 🐰, 🐻, 🌘, 🐬.\n\nCheck runs:\n\nRow5-6: 🐰🐰 → run length 2. Count +1.\n\nSo column6 contributes 1.\n\nColumn7:\n\nCheck column7.\n\nRow0: 🐬\n\nRow1: 🐻\n\nRow2: 🐻\n\nRow3: 🐘\n\nRow4: 🌘\n\nRow5: 🐏\n\nRow6: 🥀\n\nRow7: 🌘\n\nRow8: 🐏\n\nRow9: 🐆\n\nSequence: 🐬, 🐻, 🐻, 🐘, 🌘, 🐏, 🥀, 🌘, 🐏, 🐆.\n\nCheck runs:\n\nRow1-2: 🐻🐻 → run length 2. Count +1.\n\nOther pairs are different. So column7 contributes 1.\n\nColumn8:\n\nCheck column8.\n\nRow0: 🐆\n\nRow1: 🐘\n\nRow2: 🥀\n\nRow3: 🥀\n\nRow4: 🌘\n\nRow5: 🥀\n\nRow6: 🥀\n\nRow7: 🌘\n\nRow8: 🐏\n\nRow9: 🥀\n\nSequence: 🐆, 🐘, 🥀, 🥀, 🌘, 🥀, 🥀, 🌘, 🐏, 🥀.\n\nCheck runs:\n\nRow2-3: 🥀🥀 → run length 2. Count +1.\n\nRows5-6: 🥀🥀 → run length 2. Count +1.\n\nSo column8 has two runs. So +2.\n\nColumn9:\n\nCheck column9.\n\nRow0: 🐬\n\nRow1: 🐬\n\nRow2: 🐏\n\nRow3: 🌘\n\nRow4: 🐰\n\nRow5: 🐏\n\nRow6: 🐳\n\nRow7: 🐻\n\nRow8: 🐆\n\nRow9: 🐏\n\nSequence: 🐬, 🐬, 🐏, 🌘, 🐰, 🐏, 🐳, 🐻, 🐆, 🐏.\n\nCheck runs:\n\nRow0-1: 🐬🐬 → run length 2. Count +1.\n\nSo column9 contributes 1.\n\nNow, sum all vertical runs:\n\ncolumn0:0, column1:3, column2:0, column3:0, column4:1, column5:1, column6:1, column7:1, column8:2, column9:1.\n\nTotal vertical = 0+3+0+0+1+1+1+1+2+1= 10.\n\nNow total lines is horizontal (8) + vertical (10) = 18.\n\nWait, but wait, let's recheck the vertical counts:\n\nColumn1 has 3 runs (rows0-1, rows4-5, rows7-8).\n\nColumn4: row6-7 (🐏🐏) → yes, +1.\n\nColumn5: rows6-7 (🐆🐆) → yes, +1.\n\nColumn6: rows5-6 (🐰🐰) → yes, +1.\n\nColumn7: rows1-2 (🐻🐻) → yes, +1.\n\nColumn8: rows2-3 (🥀🥀), rows5-6 (🥀🥀) → +2.\n\nColumn9: rows0-1 (🐬🐬) → +1.\n\nSo column1=3, column4=1, column5=1, column6=1, column7=1, column8=2, column9=1. Then columns0,2,3 contribute 0.\n\nSo vertical total 3+1+1+1+1+2+1 = 10.\n\nHorizontal lines: sum was 8.\n\nTotal is 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nWait, but let me recheck the horizontal count again.\n\nRow0:1.\n\nRow1:1.\n\nRow4:2.\n\nRow6:1.\n\nRow7:2.\n\nRow8:1.\n\nOthers are 0.\n\nSo sum 1+1=2, plus 2 (row4) → 4, plus 1 (row6) →5, plus 2 (row7) →7, plus1 (row8) →8. Correct. So horizontal is 8.\n\nVertical sum is 3+1+1+1+1+2+1=10. So 8+10=18.\n\nBut wait, column1's vertical runs:\n\nIn column1, the runs are:\n\n- rows 0-1 (🐳🐳) → length 2 → +1.\n\n- rows4-5 (🐰🐰) → +1.\n\n- rows7-8 (🐆🐆) → +1.\n\nSo that's 3 in column1.\n\nYes. Column4's run is rows6-7 (🐏🐏) → +1.\n\nColumn5's run is rows6-7 (🐆🐆) → wait, column5, rows6 is 🐆 (row6, column5 is 🐆?), let me check.\n\nRow6 is: 🦂🐘🦂🌘🐏🐆🐰🐰🥀🐳. Column5 is 🐆 (row6, column5 is the sixth element? Let's count indexes.\n\nWait, rows are 0-9, each with 10 elements. For column5, each row's column5 is the sixth element (since indexes are 0-based).\n\nRow6: 🦂 (0), 🐘 (1), 🦂 (2), 🌘 (3), 🐏 (4), 🐆 (5), 🐰 (6), etc. So column5 for row6 is 🐆.\n\nRow7's column5: row7 is 🐰 (0), 🐆 (1), 🐻 (2), 🐻 (3), 🐏 (4), 🐆 (5), etc. So column5 is 🐆.\n\nSo rows6 and7's column5 are 🐆 and 🐆 → run length 2. So column5 contributes 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo vertical runs total 10.\n\nSo answer is 8+10=18?\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me recheck some rows and columns to make sure I didn't miss any runs.\n\nFor example, row7: 🐰🐆🐻🐻🐏🐆🐻🌘🌘🐻\n\nThe row7's horizontal runs are:\n\nAt positions2-3: 🐻🐻 → +1.\n\nAt positions7-8: 🌘🌘 → +1. So total 2. Yes.\n\nRow8: 🐏🐆🐬🥀🐻🦂🌘🐏🐏🐆\n\nIn row8, positions7-8: 🐏🐏 → yes. So +1.\n\nColumn8:\n\nRow2: 🥀 (column8?), wait column8 is the ninth element (index 8). Let's see row3's column8:\n\nRow3: 🐆🐘🌘🐘🐻🐏🥀🐘🥀🌘 → column8 is 🥀.\n\nRow2: 🐰🐬🦂🐏🐘🐆🐳🐻🥀🐏 → column8 is 🥀.\n\nRow3's column8: 🥀.\n\nRow4's column8: row4 is 🐘🐰🐬🐬🐳🐆🐻🌘🌘🐰 → column8 is 🌘.\n\nWait column8 in row3 is 🥀. So rows2 and3 (column8): 🥀 and 🥀? Let's check column8:\n\nRow0's column8: 🐆 (row0: 🐰🐳🐘🦂🦂🌘🐆🐬🐆🐬 → column8 is 🐆).\n\nRow1: 🐳🐳🥀🌘🐰🥀🌘🐻🐘🐬 → column8 is 🐘.\n\nRow2: 🥀 (column8 is index8: row2 is 🐰🐬🦂🐏🐘🐆🐳🐻🥀🐏 → yes, 🥀.\n\nRow3: 🥀 (column8 is index8 → row3's columns are 🐆 (0), 🐘 (1), 🌘 (2), 🐘 (3), 🐻 (4), 🐏 (5), 🥀 (6), 🐘 (7), 🥀 (8), 🌘 (9). So yes, 🥀 at column8.\n\nRow4: column8 is index8 → row4's columns: 🐘 (0), 🐰 (1), 🐬 (2), 🐬 (3), 🐳 (4), 🐆 (5), 🐻 (6), 🌘 (7), 🌘 (8), 🐰 (9). So column8 is 🌘.\n\nRow5: column8 is 🥀 (row5: 🥀🐰🐘🐻🐘🌘🐰🐏🥀🐏 → column8 is 🥀).\n\nRow6: 🥀 (column8 is row6's index8 → 🥀.\n\nRow7: column8 is 🌘 (row7's columns: 🐰 (0), 🐆 (1), 🐻 (2), 🐻 (3), 🐏 (4), 🐆 (5), 🐻 (6), 🌘 (7), 🌘 (8), 🐻 (9). So column8 is 🌘.\n\nRow8: column8 is 🐏 (row8: 🐏🐆🐬🥀🐻🦂🌘🐏🐏🐆 → column8 is 🐏.\n\nRow9: column8 is 🥀 (row9: 🥀🐬🥀🐰🦂🐻🐬🐆🥀🐏 → column8 is 🥀.\n\nSo column8's sequence:\n\nRow0: 🐆\n\nRow1: 🐘\n\nRow2: 🥀\n\nRow3: 🥀\n\nRow4: 🌘\n\nRow5: 🥀\n\nRow6: 🥀\n\nRow7: 🌘\n\nRow8: 🐏\n\nRow9: 🥀\n\nNow, looking for runs in column8.\n\nRow2-3: 🥀🥀 → run length 2 → +1.\n\nRow5-6: 🥀🥀 → run length 2 → +1.\n\nSo two runs in column8. So yes, +2.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nSo total vertical is 10, horizontal 8, total 18.

So the problem is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji on the given board, where the length is 2 or more. Each such line (like a sequence of the same emoji) should be counted, and we need to sum all of them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what counts as a line. A horizontal line would be consecutive same emojis in a row. Similarly, vertical lines are consecutive same emojis in a column. Also, the line has to be of length 2 or more. But wait, if there's a longer line, like 3 or 4, how does that count? For example, a horizontal line of 3 same emojis would count as two lines (since 3-2+1 = 2 lines of length 2 and 1 of length 3? Wait, no, maybe the problem is that each individual run counts as one line. So a run of 3 would count as 1 line of length 3. But the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more.\" So each run (a consecutive sequence) of 2 or more in a row or column. So each such run is counted once, regardless of their length. Wait, no. Let me re-read the question.\n\nThe task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more. So each individual line is a consecutive sequence. For example, in a row, if there are three ducks in a row, that's a horizontal line of length 3. So that counts as one line. Similarly, two ducks in a row would count as one. But if in the same row, after those two ducks, there's another emoji, then another three ducks, that would be two separate lines.\n\nSo the approach is to check each row for horizontal runs of length >=2. Then check each column for vertical runs of length >=2. Then sum all such runs.\n\nSo first, process each row. For each row, scan each emoji and track consecutive same emojis.\n\nLet me take the first row as an example: 🦆🦆🦆🔥🔥🦆. Let's look at the first row:\n\nIndices 0 to 5 (assuming 0-based).\n\nPositions 0-2: three ducks (🦆). That's a horizontal run of 3 → counts as 1.\n\nThen positions 3-4: two fires (🔥) → another line.\n\nPosition 5: a single 🦆 → no.\n\nSo the first row contributes 2 horizontal lines.\n\nThen move to the second row: 🦆🦆🔥🦆🦆🦆. Let's see:\n\n0-1: 🦆🦆 → line (count 1).\n\nPosition 2: 🔥 (single → no).\n\nPositions 3-5: three 🦆 → another line (count 1). So this row contributes 2 horizontal lines.\n\nThird row: 🦆🐧🔥🦆🐧🐧.\n\nStarting with 🦆 (single), then 🐧 (single), 🔥 (single), 🦆 (single), then positions 4-5: 🐧🐧 → line. So 1 horizontal line here.\n\nFourth row: 🔥🌑🦆🦆🌑🦆.\n\nCheck the row. Positions 0:🔥 single. 1:🌑 single. 2-3: 🦆🦆 → line. 4:🌑 single. 5: 🦆 single. So 1 horizontal line.\n\nFifth row: 🔥🦆🦆🐧🌑🌑.\n\nPositions 0:🔥 single. 1-2: 🦆🦆 → line. 3: 🐧 single. 4-5: 🌑🌑 → line. So two horizontal lines here.\n\nSixth row: 🐧🌑🐧🔥🦆🦆.\n\nPositions 0:🐧 single. 1:🌑 single. 2:🐧 single. 3:🔥 single. 4-5: 🦆🦆 → line. So 1 horizontal line.\n\nSo summing all horizontal lines: 2 (row1) + 2 (row2) +1 (row3) +1 (row4) +2 (row5) +1 (row6) → total horizontal lines = 2+2+1+1+2+1=9.\n\nNow check vertical lines. Each column has 6 rows (since the board has 6 rows). Wait, the board is 6 rows by 6 columns. Each column is six emojis.\n\nSo for each column, check vertical runs.\n\nLet's take column 0:\n\nRow0: 🦆\n\nRow1: 🦆\n\nRow2: 🦆\n\nRow3: 🔥\n\nRow4: 🔥\n\nRow5: 🐧\n\nSo the emojis in column0 are: 🦆, 🦆, 🦆, 🔥, 🔥, 🐧.\n\nLooking for consecutive same emojis:\n\nFirst three are 🦆. So that's a run of 3 → counts as 1 line.\n\nThen two 🔥 → another line.\n\nThen 🐧 → single. So column 0 contributes 2 vertical lines.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow0: 🦆\n\nRow1: 🦆\n\nRow2: 🐧\n\nRow3: 🌑\n\nRow4: 🦆\n\nRow5: 🌑\n\nEmojis: 🦆, 🦆, 🐧, 🌑, 🦆, 🌑.\n\nCheck runs:\n\nRow0-1: 🦆🦆 → run of 2 → 1 line.\n\nRow2: 🐧 (single).\n\nRow3: 🌑 (single).\n\nRow4: 🦆 (single).\n\nRow5: 🌑 (single).\n\nSo column1 has 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: 🦆\n\nRow1: 🔥\n\nRow2: 🔥\n\nRow3: 🦆\n\nRow4: 🦆\n\nRow5: 🐧\n\nEmojis: 🦆, 🔥, 🔥, 🦆, 🦆, 🐧.\n\nRuns:\n\nRow0: 🦆 single.\n\nRow1-2: 🔥🔥 → 1 line.\n\nRow3-4: 🦆🦆 → 1 line.\n\nRow5: 🐧 single. So column2 contributes 2 vertical lines.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🔥\n\nRow1: 🦆\n\nRow2: 🦆\n\nRow3: 🦆\n\nRow4: 🐧\n\nRow5: 🔥\n\nEmojis: 🔥, 🦆, 🦆, 🦆, 🐧, 🔥.\n\nCheck runs:\n\nRow0: 🔥 (single).\n\nRow1-3: 🦆🦆🦆 → 3 in a row → 1 line.\n\nRow4: 🐧 (single).\n\nRow5: 🔥 (single). So column3 has 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow0: 🔥\n\nRow1: 🦆\n\nRow2: 🐧\n\nRow3: 🌑\n\nRow4: 🌑\n\nRow5: 🦆\n\nEmojis: 🔥, 🦆, 🐧, 🌑, 🌑, 🦆.\n\nRuns:\n\nRow0: 🔥 (single).\n\nRow1: 🦆 (single).\n\nRow2: 🐧 (single).\n\nRow3-4: 🌑🌑 → 1 line.\n\nRow5: 🦆 (single). So column4 has 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow0: 🦆\n\nRow1: 🦆\n\nRow2: 🐧\n\nRow3: 🦆\n\nRow4: 🌑\n\nRow5: 🦆\n\nEmojis: 🦆, 🦆, 🐧, 🦆, 🌑, 🦆.\n\nRuns:\n\nRow0-1: 🦆🦆 → 1 line.\n\nRow2: 🐧 (single).\n\nRow3: 🦆 (single).\n\nRow4: 🌑 (single).\n\nRow5: 🦆 (single). So column5 contributes 1 vertical line.\n\nNow sum all vertical lines. Let's see:\n\nColumn0: 2.\n\nColumn1:1.\n\nColumn2:2.\n\nColumn3:1.\n\nColumn4:1.\n\nColumn5:1.\n\nTotal vertical lines: 2+1+2+1+1+1 = 8.\n\nSo total lines (horizontal + vertical) = 9 (horizontal) +8 (vertical) = 17.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me recount to make sure.\n\nWait, horizontal count: adding the rows.\n\nRow1 (first row): 2 lines.\n\nRow2 (second row): 2 lines.\n\nRow3 (third row): 1.\n\nRow4 (fourth row): 1.\n\nRow5 (fifth row): 2.\n\nRow6 (sixth row):1.\n\nSo 2+2+1+1+2+1=9. Correct.\n\nVertical:\n\nColumns 0: runs of 3 and 2 → 2.\n\nColumn1: run of 2 →1.\n\nColumn2: two runs (2 and 2) →2.\n\nColumn3: run of 3 →1.\n\nColumn4: run of 2 →1.\n\nColumn5: run of 2 →1.\n\nAdding them: 2+1=3, 2→5, 1→6, 1→7, 1→8. Wait no. Wait 2 (col0) +1 (col1) =3. Then col2 adds 2 →5. Col3 adds 1 →6. Col4 adds1 →7. Col5 adds1 →8. So total vertical is 8.\n\nSo total lines:9+8=17.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recheck some columns.\n\nLet me check column0 again:\n\nEmojis are:\n\nRow0: 🦆\n\nRow1: 🦆\n\nRow2: 🦆\n\nRow3: 🔥\n\nRow4: 🔥\n\nRow5: 🐧.\n\nSo the runs are:\n\nRow0-2: three 🦆 → one line (length 3).\n\nThen row3-4: two 🔥 → another line.\n\nSo yes, two vertical lines here.\n\nColumn2:\n\nEmojis are: 🦆 (row0), 🔥 (row1), 🔥 (row2), 🦆 (row3), 🦆 (row4), 🐧 (row5).\n\nRuns:\n\nRow1-2: two 🔥 → one line.\n\nRow3-4: two 🦆 → one line.\n\nSo two vertical lines. Correct.\n\nColumn3: emojis are 🔥 (row0), 🦆 (row1), 🦆 (row2), 🦆 (row3), 🐧 (row4), 🔥 (row5).\n\nThe runs here are from row1-3: three 🦆 → one line. Yes. So one vertical line.\n\nColumn4: rows are 🔥 (row0), 🦆 (row1), 🐧 (row2), 🌑 (row3), 🌑 (row4), 🦆 (row5).\n\nRow3-4: two 🌑 → one line.\n\nSo yes, one vertical line.\n\nColumn5: rows are 🦆 (row0), 🦆 (row1), 🐧 (row2), 🦆 (row3), 🌑 (row4), 🦆 (row5).\n\nRuns in column5: row0-1: two 🦆 → one line. Then others are single. So one vertical line.\n\nSo vertical lines total 2+1+2+1+1+1=8. Correct.\n\nSo total lines would be 9+8=17.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I miscounted the horizontal lines. Let me recheck each row.\n\nRow1 (first row): 🦆🦆🦆🔥🔥🦆 → runs of 3 (count 1), 2 (count1), and 1. So 2 lines. Correct.\n\nRow2 (second row): 🦆🦆🔥🦆🦆🦆 → runs of 2 (count1), then 3 (count1). So 2 lines. Correct.\n\nRow3 (third row): 🦆🐧🔥🦆🐧🐧 → runs of 2 (🐧🐧) →1 line. Correct.\n\nRow4 (fourth row):🔥🌑🦆🦆🌑🦆 → run of 2 (🦆🦆) →1. Correct.\n\nRow5 (fifth row):🔥🦆🦆🐧🌑🌑 → run of 2 (🦆🦆) and run of 2 (🌑🌑) → 2 lines. Correct.\n\nRow6 (sixth row):🐧🌑🐧🔥🦆🦆 → run of 2 (🦆🦆) →1. Correct.\n\nSo horizontal lines sum to 2+2+1+1+2+1=9. Correct.\n\nSo total answer is 17.

I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines made by the same emoji with length 2 or more on this board. Hmm. So the lines can be horizontal (same row) or vertical (same column). Each line is a consecutive sequence, right? And the length has to be at least 2. Also, overlapping lines might count as separate. Wait, for example, if there's a row like A A A, then that's two lines of length 2 (positions 0-1 and 1-2), but maybe the problem counts the entire consecutive run as a single line. Wait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". Oh, I think each maximal consecutive sequence of the same emoji in a line (row or column) counts as one line. So for example, in a row like A A A, that's a single line of length 3. So each such run contributes one to the total count if its length is >=2.\n\nSo the approach is to check each row for horizontal runs, and each column for vertical runs, count each run of length >=2 once.\n\nThe board is given as a grid. Let's look at the input.\n\nThe board is 6 rows, each with 6 emojis. Let's write them down:\n\nRow 0: 🐐🌒🐐💥💥🌒\n\nRow 1: 🌒🌒💥🐼🐐🌒\n\nRow 2: 💥🐐💥🐼💥🐼\n\nRow 3: 🐼💥💥🐼💥🐐\n\nRow 4: 🐐🐼💥💥🐼🐐\n\nRow 5: 🐐💥💥🌒🐐🐼\n\nSo let's process each row first.\n\nStarting with row 0: 🐐, 🌒, 🐐, 💥, 💥, 🌒.\n\nLooking for consecutive same emojis. Let's split into runs.\n\nPosition 0: 🐐. Next is 🌒 (diff). So run length 1, no count.\n\nPosition 1: 🌒. Next is 🐐. Run length 1, no count.\n\nPosition 2: 🐐. Next is 💥. Run 1, no.\n\nPositions 3-4: 💥💥. That's a run of 2, so count 1.\n\nPosition 4: next is 🌒, so end of run. So row 0 contributes 1 horizontal.\n\nRow 1: 🌒🌒💥🐼🐐🌒.\n\nRuns:\n\nPositions 0-1: 🌒🌒 (run of 2) → count 1.\n\nPosition 2: 💥 (single).\n\nPosition 3: 🐼 (single).\n\nPosition 4: 🐐 (single).\n\nPosition 5: 🌒 (single). So total 1 horizontal here.\n\nRow 2: 💥🐐💥🐼💥🐼.\n\nCheck each consecutive.\n\nPositions 0: 💥, next is 🐐. No run.\n\nPos 1: 🐐 → next is 💥. No.\n\nPos 2: 💥 → next is 🐼. No.\n\nPos 3: 🐼 → next is 💥. No.\n\nPos 4: 💥 → next is 🐼. No. So no runs in this row. So row 2 contributes 0.\n\nRow 3: 🐼💥💥🐼💥🐐.\n\nCheck runs:\n\nPos 0: 🐼, next is 💥. No.\n\nPos 1-2: 💥💥 → run of 2 → count 1.\n\nPos 3: 🐼 → next is 💥. No.\n\nPos 4: 💥 → next is 🐐. No. So row 3 has 1.\n\nRow 4: 🐐🐼💥💥🐼🐐.\n\nCheck:\n\nPos 0: 🐐 → next 🐼. No.\n\nPos 1: 🐼 → next 💥. No.\n\nPos 2-3: 💥💥 → run of 2 → count 1.\n\nPos 4: 🐼 → next 🐐. No. So row 4 contributes 1.\n\nRow 5: 🐐💥💥🌒🐐🐼.\n\nPos 1-2: 💥💥 → run of 2 → count 1.\n\nOthers are single. So row 5 contributes 1.\n\nSo total horizontal lines: 1 (row0) +1 (row1) +0 (row2) +1 (row3) +1 (row4) +1 (row5) = 1+1+1+1+1=5? Wait, adding 1+1 is 2, plus 1 (row3) is 3, plus 1 (row4) is 4, plus 1 (row5) is 5. So horizontal total is 5.\n\nNow check the columns. Each column has 6 elements.\n\nLet's process each column 0 to 5.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRows 0-5: 🐐, 🌒, 💥, 🐼, 🐐, 🐐.\n\nCheck runs:\n\nLooking for consecutive same in the column.\n\nIn the vertical direction, the elements are:\n\nRow0: 🐐\n\nRow1: 🌒\n\nRow2: 💥\n\nRow3: 🐼\n\nRow4: 🐐\n\nRow5: 🐐\n\nSo column 0:\n\nRow0: 🐐. Row1 is different. So run ends. Then row4 and 5 are 🐐, but between row3 and 4, it's 🐼 and 🐐. So row4 and row5 are consecutive 🐐. So in column 0, from row4 to row5: two consecutive 🐐. So run of 2. So that's one vertical line. So column 0 contributes 1.\n\nWait, the vertical runs are consecutive in the column. So looking for sequences in the column.\n\nLet me process column 0:\n\nElements: 🐐 (0), 🌒 (1), 💥 (2), 🐼 (3), 🐐 (4), 🐐 (5).\n\nSo let's group consecutive same.\n\nStart at row0: 🐐. Next is different, so run length 1.\n\nRow1: 🌒. Next is 💥, run length 1.\n\nRow2: 💥. Next is 🐼, run 1.\n\nRow3: 🐼. Next is 🐐 (row4). Run 1.\n\nRow4: 🐐. Next row5 is 🐐. So run starts at row4, ends at row5. That's length 2. So one run here. So column0 has one vertical run of 2.\n\nSo column0: 1.\n\nColumn1:\n\nElements: row0: 🌒, row1: 🌒, row2: 🐐, row3: 💥, row4: 🐼, row5: 💥.\n\nSo column1:\n\nrow0: 🌒, row1: 🌒 → run of 2. So that's one.\n\nThen row2: 🐐 (different), row3: 💥, row4: 🐼, row5: 💥.\n\nSo runs in column1:\n\nThe first two are 🌒🌒 → count 1.\n\nOthers are single. So column1 contributes 1.\n\nColumn2:\n\nElements:\n\nrow0: 🐐, row1: 💥, row2: 💥, row3: 💥, row4: 💥, row5: 💥.\n\nWait, let's check each row's column2:\n\nRow0: column2 is 🐐 (since row0's elements are [0]🐐, [1]🌒, [2]🐐, etc. Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, original rows:\n\nRow0: 🐐🌒🐐💥💥🌒 → indexes 0 to 5.\n\nSo column0 is 🐐 (row0), column1 is 🌒 (row0), column2 is 🐐 (row0), column3 is 💥 (row0), etc.\n\nWait no, the columns are built by taking each row's elements in order. For example, column 0 consists of row0's first element, row1's first, etc.\n\nSo for column0:\n\nRow0: first element is 🐐 (0)\n\nRow1: first element is 🌒 (0)\n\nRow2: first element is 💥 (0)\n\nRow3: first element is 🐼 (0)\n\nRow4: first element is 🐐 (0)\n\nRow5: first element is 🐐 (0)\n\nAh, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, column1:\n\nRow0: second element is 🌒 (position1)\n\nRow1: second element is 🌒 (position1)\n\nRow2: second element is 🐐 (position1)\n\nRow3: second element is 💥 (position1)\n\nRow4: second element is 🐼 (position1)\n\nRow5: second element is 💥 (position1)\n\nSo column2:\n\nEach row's third element (index 2).\n\nRow0: 🐐 (index2)\n\nRow1: 💥 (index2)\n\nRow2: 💥 (index2)\n\nRow3: 💥 (index2)\n\nRow4: 💥 (index2)\n\nRow5: 💥 (index2)\n\nWait, let's recheck:\n\nRow0: elements are [0]🐐, [1]🌒, [2]🐐, [3]💥, [4]💥, [5]🌒.\n\nSo column2 is the third element of each row. So row0's column2 is 🐐 (index2).\n\nRow1: elements are [0]🌒, [1]🌒, [2]💥, [3]🐼, [4]🐐, [5]🌒. So column2 (index2) is 💥.\n\nRow2: elements are [0]💥, [1]🐐, [2]💥, [3]🐼, [4]💥, [5]🐼 → column2 is 💥 (index2).\n\nRow3: [0]🐼, [1]💥, [2]💥, [3]🐼, [4]💥, [5]🐐 → column2 is 💥.\n\nRow4: [0]🐐, [1]🐼, [2]💥, [3]💥, [4]🐼, [5]🐐 → column2 is 💥.\n\nRow5: [0]🐐, [1]💥, [2]💥, [3]🌒, [4]🐐, [5]🐼 → column2 is 💥.\n\nSo column2 has elements: 🐐, 💥, 💥, 💥, 💥, 💥.\n\nSo let's look for vertical runs here.\n\nStarting from row0:\n\nrow0: 🐐. row1 is 💥 (diff). So run length 1.\n\nThen row1: 💥, row2: 💥, row3: 💥, row4: 💥, row5: 💥. That's a run of 5 💥. So that's one run of length >=2. So column2 contributes 1.\n\nSo column2 vertical count is 1.\n\nColumn3:\n\nEach row's 4th element (index3). Let's list them:\n\nrow0: 💥 (index3)\n\nrow1: 🐼 (index3)\n\nrow2: 🐼 (index3)\n\nrow3: 🐼 (index3)\n\nrow4: 💥 (index3)\n\nrow5: 🌒 (index3)\n\nSo column3 elements: 💥, 🐼, 🐼, 🐼, 💥, 🌒.\n\nProcessing runs:\n\nrow0: 💥 (single).\n\nrow1: 🐼 → run starts here. row2 and row3 are 🐼. So from row1 to row3: three 🐼. That's a run of 3 → count 1.\n\nrow4: 💥 (single).\n\nrow5: 🌒 (single). So column3 contributes 1.\n\nColumn4:\n\nEach row's 5th element (index4).\n\nrow0: 💥 (index4)\n\nrow1: 🐐 (index4)\n\nrow2: 💥 (index4)\n\nrow3: 💥 (index4)\n\nrow4: 🐼 (index4)\n\nrow5: 🐐 (index4)\n\nSo column4 elements: 💥, 🐐, 💥, 💥, 🐼, 🐐.\n\nRuns:\n\nrow0: 💥. row1: 🐐 (diff). So run 1.\n\nrow1: 🐐 → next is 💥 (diff). Run 1.\n\nrow2: 💥. row3: 💥 → run of 2. Count 1.\n\nrow4: 🐼 (single). row5: 🐐 (single). So column4 has 1.\n\nColumn5:\n\nEach row's 6th element (index5).\n\nrow0: 🌒 (index5)\n\nrow1: 🌒 (index5)\n\nrow2: 🐼 (index5)\n\nrow3: 🐐 (index5)\n\nrow4: 🐐 (index5)\n\nrow5: 🐼 (index5)\n\nSo elements are: 🌒, 🌒, 🐼, 🐐, 🐐, 🐼.\n\nProcessing:\n\nrow0-1: 🌒🌒 → run of 2 → count 1.\n\nrow3-4: 🐐🐐 → run of 2 → count 1. So column5 has 2 vertical runs.\n\nSo columns:\n\nColumn0: 1\n\nColumn1:1\n\nColumn2:1\n\nColumn3:1\n\nColumn4:1\n\nColumn5:2\n\nTotal vertical lines: 1+1+1+1+1+2 =7.\n\nSo total horizontal lines (5) and vertical lines (7) sum to 5+7=12.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check all the columns again.\n\nColumn0:\n\nAs before, the vertical run is row4 and 5 (🐐🐐) → 2 → 1.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRows0-1 (🌒🌒) → 2 → 1.\n\nColumn2:\n\nThe run starts at row1 (💥) and continues to row5. Wait, column2 elements are:\n\nRow0: 🐐\n\nRow1: 💥\n\nRow2: 💥\n\nRow3: 💥\n\nRow4: 💥\n\nRow5: 💥\n\nSo from row1 to row5: 5 consecutive 💥. So the run is of length 5 → count 1.\n\nYes.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRows1-3: 🐼🐼🐼 → run of 3 → count 1.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRows2-3: 💥💥 → run of 2 → count 1.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRows0-1: 🌒🌒 → run of 2 (count 1).\n\nRows3-4: 🐐🐐 → run of 2 (count 1). So column5 contributes 2.\n\nSo vertical sum is 1+1+1+1+1+2=7. Correct.\n\nSo total lines: horizontal 5 + vertical 7 = 12. So the answer should be 12.\n\nBut wait, let me recheck the horizontal counts again.\n\nRow0: 🐐,🌒,🐐,💥,💥,🌒 → run at 3-4 (💥💥) → 1. Correct.\n\nRow1: 🌒🌒💥🐼🐐🌒 → run at 0-1 (🌒🌒) → 1.\n\nRow2: all single, no runs.\n\nRow3: 🐼,💥💥,🐼,💥,🐐 → run at 1-2 (💥💥) →1.\n\nRow4: 🐐,🐼,💥💥,🐼,🐐 → run at 2-3 (💥💥) →1.\n\nRow5: 🐐,💥💥,🌒,🐐,🐼 → run at 1-2 (💥💥) →1.\n\nSo horizontal total is 1+1+1+1+1=5 (wait, row0:1, row1:1, row3:1, row4:1, row5:1 → 5. Correct.\n\nSo adding 5+7=12. So the answer is 12.\n\n\nAnswer: 12"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

So, the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines made up of the same emoji, and each line has to be length 2 or more. The board is a 7x7 grid, right? Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to check all possible horizontal lines. For each row, I need to look for consecutive emojis. Like, in a row, if there are two or more same emojis in a straight line horizontally, that counts as one line. But wait, the same consecutive sequence can have multiple lines. For example, if there are three in a row, that's two lines (length 2 and 3, but maybe each counts as one). Wait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with length of 2 or more\". So each such line is counted once if it's a continuous sequence. So like, three same emojis in a row would form one line of length 3. So each consecutive group of same emojis in a row counts as one line if their length is >=2.\n\nSimilarly for vertical lines. So, each group of same emojis in a column that is vertical and has length >=2 counts as one.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Check each row for horizontal sequences.\n2. Check each column for vertical sequences.\n3. Sum all such sequences.\n\nSo I need to look through each row, count how many groups of consecutive same emojis have length >=2. Then do the same for each column.\n\nLet me start with the horizontal lines. Let's look at each row of the provided board:\n\nThe board is given as:\n\nRow 0: 🌘🦭🦭🦎🦏🌘🦭\nRow 1: 🌘💧🦏🌘🌘🦏🐳\nRow 2: 🐳💧💧🦭🐳🦎⛅️\nRow 3: 💧🌘🦭🌘🦏🐳💧\nRow 4: 🦎⛅️🐳🦭💧🌘🦎\nRow 5: ⛅️🦎💧🌘💧🦭⛅️\nRow 6: 🦏🐳⛅️⛅️⛅️💧🌘\n\nLet's go row by row.\n\nRow 0: First emoji is 🌘, then three 🦭. Wait, the row is written as 🌘, then three 🦭? Wait, the first row is: 🌘, 🦭, 🦭, 🦎, 🦏, 🌘, 🦭. Let's check each element. Wait, the first row is: emojis in positions 0 to 6.\n\nLooking at row 0:\nIndices 0: 🌘\n1: 🦭\n2: 🦭\n3: 🦎\n4: 🦏\n5: 🌘\n6: 🦭\n\nSo consecutive same emojis here: positions 1-2 (🦭, 2 in a row). Then others are single. So this row contributes 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow 1: 🌘, 💧, 🦏, 🌘, 🌘, 🦏, 🐳\n\nCheck the consecutive same:\n\n- 🌘 at 0 is single.\n- 💧 at 1 single.\n- 🦏 at 2 single.\n- 🌘 at 3 and 4 (two in a row). So this counts as one line.\n- Then 🦏 at 5 single.\n- 🐳 at 6 single.\nSo row 1 contributes 1.\n\nRow 2: 🐳, 💧, 💧, 🦭, 🐳, 🦎, ⛅️\n\nConsecutive same:\n- 🐳 at 0 single.\n- 💧 at 1 and 2 (two), so one line.\n- 🦭 at 3 single.\n- 🐳 at 4 single.\n- Others single. So row 2 has 1 line.\n\nRow 3: 💧, 🌘, 🦭, 🌘, 🦏, 🐳, 💧\n\nLooking for consecutive same: all are single. So no horizontal lines here.\n\nRow 4: 🦎, ⛅️, 🐳, 🦭, 💧, 🌘, 🦎\n\nAll emojis are different from their next. So no horizontal lines.\n\nRow 5: ⛅️, 🦎, 💧, 🌘, 💧, 🦭, ⛅️\n\nCheck each pair. All adjacent are different. So no lines here.\n\nRow 6: 🦏, 🐳, ⛅️, ⛅️, ⛅️, 💧, 🌘\n\nIn row 6, positions 2,3,4 are all ⛅️. So three in a row. So that's a group of 3, which counts as one line.\n\nSo horizontal lines sum: 1 (row0) +1 (row1)+1 (row2)+1 (row6) = total 4.\n\nWait, row6's consecutive starts at position 2, three in a row. So that's one line, even though it's three. So horizontal lines contribute 4.\n\nNow vertical lines: check each column for consecutive same emojis.\n\nThere are 7 columns (0 to 6). Each column has 7 rows. For each column, check consecutive same in vertical direction.\n\nLet's check each column one by one.\n\nColumn 0:\nRow0: 🌘\nRow1: 🌘\nRow2: 🐳\nRow3: 💧\nRow4: 🦎\nRow5: ⛅️\nRow6: 🦏\n\nCheck consecutive same. For vertical, each consecutive in the same column.\n\nLooking at column 0:\n\nRow0 is 🌘, row1 is 🌘. So two in a row. Then row2 is different. So this is a vertical line of length 2. So counts as 1.\n\nRow3 to row6 in column 0: all different. So column 0 has 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow0: 🦭\nRow1: 💧\nRow2: 💧\nRow3: 🌘\nRow4: ⛅️\nRow5: 🦎\nRow6: 🐳\n\nCheck consecutive same:\n\nRow1 and row2: 💧 and 💧. So two in a row. That's a vertical line. So column1 has 1.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: 🦭\nRow1: 🦏\nRow2: 💧\nRow3: 🦭\nRow4: 🐳\nRow5: 💧\nRow6: ⛅️\n\nLooking at consecutive:\n\nRow0 (🦭) and row1 (🦏) different. Row1 and 2: 🦏 and 💧 different. Row2 and 3: 💧 and 🦭 different. etc. No consecutive same. So column2 has 0.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🦎\nRow1: 🌘\nRow2: 🦭\nRow3: 🌘\nRow4: 🦭\nRow5: 🌘\nRow6: ⛅️\n\nCheck consecutive same:\n\nRow1 (🌘), row3 (🌘) not adjacent. So no consecutive same here.\n\nWait, vertical lines are consecutive in rows. So for column3, each pair of rows in the same column.\n\nRow0: 🦎, row1: 🌘 → different. row1: 🌘, row2: 🦭 → different. row2: 🦭, row3: 🌘 → different. So no vertical lines in column3.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow0: 🦏\nRow1: 🌘\nRow2: 🐳\nRow3: 🦏\nRow4: 💧\nRow5: 💧\nRow6: ⛅️\n\nCheck consecutive same:\n\nRow5 and row6: 💧 and ⛅️ → different. Wait, column4's rows are:\n\nRow0: 🦏\nRow1: 🌘\nRow2: 🐳\nRow3: 🦏\nRow4: 💧\nRow5: 💧\nRow6: ⛅️\n\nLooking at vertical pairs. Row4 and row5: 💧 and 💧 → two in a row. So that's a vertical line of length 2. So column4 has 1 line.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow0: 🌘\nRow1: 🦏\nRow2: 🦎\nRow3: 🐳\nRow4: 🌘\nRow5: 🦭\nRow6: 💧\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\nAll adjacent pairs in this column are different. So no vertical lines here.\n\nColumn6:\n\nRow0: 🦭\nRow1: 🐳\nRow2: ⛅️\nRow3: 💧\nRow4: 🦎\nRow5: ⛅️\nRow6: 🌘\n\nLooking for consecutive same:\n\nRow0: 🦭, row1: 🐳 → different. Row1: 🐳, row2: ⛅️ → different. etc. No vertical lines here.\n\nSo columns 0,1,4 each have 1 vertical line. So vertical lines total 3.\n\nWait column4: rows 4 and 5 are both 💧. So that's two in a row. So that's one vertical line.\n\nWait, columns:\n\n- Column0: rows 0-1 are 🌘, so 1.\n- Column1: rows 1-2 are 💧, so 1.\n- Column4: rows 4-5 are 💧, so 1.\nSo vertical lines total 3.\n\nSo total lines are horizontal 4 + vertical 3 = 7? Wait, no. Wait, let me recheck.\n\nWait, horizontal lines: row0: 1, row1:1, row2:1, row6:1. That's four.\n\nVertical lines: column0:1, column1:1, column4:1. That's three. So total 7?\n\nWait that's 4+3=7. But maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait let me recheck each row and column.\n\nLet me re-examine each row:\n\nRow0: 🌘 🦭 🦭 🦎 🦏 🌘 🦭\n\nThe consecutive same in the row are positions 1 and 2 (two 🦭). So that's one line. Correct. So row0 contributes 1.\n\nRow1: 🌘 💧 🦏 🌘 🌘 🦏 🐳\n\nConsecutive in positions 3 and 4 (two 🌘). So one line. Correct. So row1:1.\n\nRow2: 🐳 💧 💧 🦭 🐳 🦎 ⛅️\n\nConsecutive in positions 1 and 2 (two 💧). So one line. Correct.\n\nRow3: all singles. So 0.\n\nRow4: all singles. So 0.\n\nRow5: all singles. So 0.\n\nRow6: 🦏 🐳 ⛅️ ⛅️ ⛅️ 💧 🌘\n\nConsecutive in positions 2,3,4 (three ⛅️). So that's one line. So row6:1.\n\nSo horizontal lines: 1+1+1+1=4. Correct.\n\nNow vertical lines:\n\nColumn0:\n\nRows 0: 🌘\n\nRow1: 🌘 → same as row0. So that's two in a row. So one line. But wait, vertical lines are consecutive in the column, meaning a sequence down the column. So for column0, the first two rows are 🌘, then the third is 🐳. So this counts as a vertical line of length 2. Correct. So column0:1.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRows:\n\n0: 🦭\n\n1: 💧\n\n2: 💧\n\nSo looking at consecutive in the column. Row1 and row2 are 💧, so two in a row. So this is a vertical line of length 2. Column1:1.\n\nBut wait, column1's rows are:\n\nRow0: 🦭 (1st position)\nRow1: 💧 (second)\nRow2: 💧 (third)\nRow3: 🌘 (fourth)\nRow4: ⛅️ (fifth)\nRow5: 🦎 (sixth)\nRow6: 🐳 (seventh)\n\nSo looking at column1, rows1 and 2 (indices 1 and 2 if starting from 0?) Wait, rows in the code are 0-based. So row indices 0 to 6.\n\nSo column1:\n\nRow0: 🦭\n\nRow1: 💧\n\nRow2: 💧\n\nRow3: 🌘\n\nRow4: ⛅️\n\nRow5: 🦎\n\nRow6: 🐳\n\nSo consecutive in column1: between row1 and row2 (both 💧). So vertical line here. Correct.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRows:\n\nRow0: 🦏\n\nRow1: 🌘\n\nRow2: 🐳\n\nRow3: 🦏\n\nRow4: 💧\n\nRow5: 💧\n\nRow6: ⛅️\n\nLooking at column4, consecutive same:\n\nRow4 is 💧, row5 is 💧. So two in a row. So vertical line here. Column4:1.\n\nColumns 0,1,4 each have 1 vertical line. So vertical lines total 3.\n\nSo total lines: 4 (horizontal) +3 (vertical) =7.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed some other columns.\n\nLet me check column5 again.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow0: 🌘\n\nRow1: 🦏\n\nRow2: 🦎\n\nRow3: 🐳\n\nRow4: 🌘\n\nRow5: 🦭\n\nRow6: 💧\n\nAll adjacent rows here are different. So no vertical lines.\n\nWhat about column6?\n\nColumn6:\n\nRow0: 🦭\n\nRow1: 🐳\n\nRow2: ⛅️\n\nRow3: 💧\n\nRow4: 🦎\n\nRow5: ⛅️\n\nRow6: 🌘\n\nNo consecutive same.\n\nWhat about column3?\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🦎\n\nRow1: 🌘\n\nRow2: 🦭\n\nRow3: 🌘\n\nRow4: 🦭\n\nRow5: 🌘\n\nRow6: ⛅️\n\nLooking for consecutive same here. Let's see:\n\nRow0: 🦎\n\nRow1: 🌘 → different.\n\nRow1: 🌘, row2: 🦭 → different.\n\nRow2: 🦭, row3: 🌘 → different.\n\nRow3: 🌘, row4: 🦭 → different.\n\nRow4: 🦭, row5: 🌘 → different.\n\nRow5: 🌘, row6: ⛅️ → different. So no lines here.\n\nSo indeed, vertical lines are 3.\n\nSo total answer would be 4+3=7. But wait, that can't be right. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in vertical lines. Let's check column4 again.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRows 0: 🦏\n\nRow1: 🌘\n\nRow2: 🐳\n\nRow3: 🦏\n\nRow4: 💧\n\nRow5: 💧\n\nRow6: ⛅️\n\nSo row4 and row5 are both 💧. So that's two consecutive in the column. So yes, counts as one line. So column4:1.\n\nSo vertical lines: columns0,1,4. Correct. So 3.\n\nHmm. So the total is 7. But let's see, maybe I missed some lines.\n\nWait, another possibility: in vertical columns, perhaps sequences longer than 2. For example, three in a row in a column. But in this case, I don't think any of them have that. Let's check.\n\nLooking again at each column:\n\nFor example, column1, rows1 and 2 are 💧. So two in a row. That's one line.\n\nColumn0, rows0 and 1 are 🌘. Two in a row. Correct.\n\nColumn4, rows4 and 5 are 💧. Two in a row.\n\nSo all vertical lines are length 2. So each contributes 1. So vertical sum is 3.\n\nSo total lines are 4+3=7. But I feel like maybe there's something missing. Let me go back and check each row again.\n\nAnother thing: when counting horizontal lines, the row6 has three consecutive ⛅️. That's one line. So correct.\n\nWhat about row3: 💧🌘🦭🌘🦏🐳💧. All are single. So yes, no lines.\n\nRow4: 🦎⛅️🐳🦭💧🌘🦎. All different.\n\nRow5: ⛅️🦎💧🌘💧🦭⛅️. All different. So no lines.\n\nSo horizontal lines are 4.\n\nSo answer is 7?\n\nBut maybe I missed some. Let me check again:\n\nFor example, let's re-examine each row's horizontal lines.\n\nRow0: positions 1-2 are 🦭. So yes.\n\nRow1: positions3-4 are 🌘.\n\nRow2: positions1-2 are 💧.\n\nRow6: positions2-4 are ⛅️ (three in a row). So one line.\n\nSo that's four.\n\nVertical lines:\n\nColumns0,1,4 have one each. So 3.\n\nTotal 7.\n\nYes.

Let me write them out row by row:\n\nRow 0: 🌻, 😁, 🐧, 😁, 😁\nRow 1: 😁, 🐧, 😁, 🐧, 😁\nRow 2: 😁, 🐧, 😁, 🐧, 😁\nRow 3: 😁, 😁, 🐧, 🐧, 🌻\nRow 4: 🐧, 🌻, 😁, 🐧, 😁\n\nNow, I need to check both horizontal and vertical lines.

Like, for example, a horizontal line of three same emojis in a row would count as one line of length 3, but according to the problem statement, each line (sequence) that is 2 or longer counts as one. So each run of same emojis contributes one to the total count if its length is >=2. So for example, a horizontal row of 😁😁😁 would contribute 1 horizontal line. Similarly, vertical sequences are considered the same way.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. Check each row for consecutive same emojis. For each row, go through each position and check how long each consecutive run is. For example, in row 0: 🌻, 😁, 🐧, 😁, 😁. Let's look at row 0:\n\nPositions 0 to 4:\n\n0: 🌻\n1: 😁 (different from previous)\n2: 🐧 (diff)\n3: 😁 (diff)\n4: 😁 (same as 3, so run of 2). So in row 0, there's a run at positions 3-4 (length 2), so that's 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow 1: 😁, 🐧, 😁, 🐧, 😁. Let's see. Each emoji alternates. So the runs are all single emojis. So no horizontal lines here.\n\nRow 2: same as row 1? Let's check. 😁, 🐧, 😁, 🐧, 😁. Yes, same as row 1. So no horizontal lines here either.\n\nRow 3: 😁, 😁, 🐧, 🐧, 🌻. Let's see. Positions 0-1: two 😁 (run of 2). Then positions 2-3: two 🐧 (run of 2). So row 3 contributes two horizontal lines.\n\nRow 4: 🐧, 🌻, 😁, 🐧, 😁. No consecutive same emojis. So no horizontal lines here.\n\nSo total horizontal lines so far: 1 (row 0) + 0 +0 + 2 (row3) +0= 3.\n\nNow vertical lines. Each column has 5 rows. Let's check each column for vertical runs.\n\nThere are 5 columns (each has 5 elements). Let's go through each column:\n\nColumn 0:\nRow0: 🌻\nRow1: 😁\nRow2: 😁\nRow3: 😁\nRow4: 🐧\n\nLooking for vertical runs. So in column 0:\n\nRow0: 🌻. Then row1: 😁 (different). So no run here. Then rows1-2-3 are 😁? Let's see:\n\nRow1: 😁, row2: 😁, row3: 😁. Wait, column 0:\n\nRow0: 🌻\n\nRow1: 😁\n\nRow2: 😁\n\nRow3: 😁\n\nRow4: 🐧\n\nSo from rows 1 to 3 (three consecutive 😁), so that's a vertical run of length 3. So that's one vertical line. Then row4 is 🐧, different. So column 0 contributes 1 vertical line.\n\nWait, but wait. The run starts at row1 and continues to row3. So the consecutive same emojis are from row1 to row3 (3 in a row). So that's a vertical line of length 3, which counts as 1.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow0: 😁\n\nRow1: 🐧\n\nRow2: 🐧\n\nRow3: 😁\n\nRow4: 🌻\n\nLooking for vertical runs:\n\nRow0: 😁. Row1: 🐧 (diff). So no run here. Then row1: 🐧, row2: 🐧 (same). So a run of 2. Then row3 is 😁 (diff). So that's a vertical run from row1 to row2 (2), which counts as 1. So column1 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow0: 🐧\n\nRow1: 😁\n\nRow2: 😁\n\nRow3: 🐧\n\nRow4: 😁\n\nCheck vertical runs:\n\nRow0: 🐧. Row1: 😁 (diff). Then row1: 😁, row2: 😁 (same, run of 2). Then row3: 🐧 (diff). So that's a run of 2 (rows1-2). So 1 vertical line here. Then row3: 🐧, row4: 😁 (diff). So total 1 vertical line in column2.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 😁\n\nRow1: 🐧\n\nRow2: 🐧\n\nRow3: 🐧\n\nRow4: 🐧\n\nLooking for vertical runs:\n\nRow0: 😁. Row1: 🐧 (diff). So no run here. Then rows1-4: 🐧, 🐧, 🐧, 🐧. Wait, rows1 to 4 (rows 1,2,3,4) have 🐧. That's 4 in a row. So that's a vertical run of 4, which counts as 1. So column3 contributes 1.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow0: 😁\n\nRow1: 😁\n\nRow2: 😁\n\nRow3: 🌻\n\nRow4: 😁\n\nLooking for vertical runs:\n\nRow0: 😁, row1: 😁 (same), row2: 😁 (same) → run of 3. Then row3: 🌻 (diff). Then row4: 😁. So the vertical run from rows0-2 (3), which counts as 1. So column4 contributes 1.\n\nSo total vertical lines:\n\nColumn0:1, column1:1, column2:1, column3:1, column4:1 → total 5 vertical lines.\n\nSo total lines would be horizontal (3) + vertical (5) → 8?\n\nWait, let me recheck each part.\n\nHorizontal lines:\n\nRow0: the sequence ends with 😁😁 (positions 3-4). So that's one run.\n\nRow1: all emojis alternate, so no runs.\n\nRow2: same as row1.\n\nRow3: positions 0-1 (😁😁) → run of 2. positions 2-3 (🐧🐧) → run of 2. So two runs here.\n\nRow4: no runs.\n\nTotal horizontal: 1+0+0+2+0=3.\n\nVertical lines:\n\nEach column:\n\nColumn0:\n\nRows1-3: 😁, 😁, 😁 → run of 3. So 1.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow1-2: 🐧🐧 → run of 2. So 1.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow1-2: 😁😁 → run of 2. So 1.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRows1-4: 🐧🐧🐧🐧 → run of 4. So 1.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRows0-2: 😁😁😁 → run of 3. So 1.\n\nSo vertical lines: 1 (col0) +1 (col1) +1 (col2) +1 (col3) +1 (col4) =5.\n\nTotal lines: 3 +5=8.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in vertical column3. Let's check column3 again.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 😁\n\nRow1: 🐧\n\nRow2: 🐧\n\nRow3: 🐧\n\nRow4: 🐧\n\nSo rows1 to 4 are all 🐧. That's four consecutive same emojis. So that's one vertical line here (length 4 counts as one). Yes.\n\nAnother possible mistake: in column0, rows1-3 are three 😁, but does that count as a single run? Yes. Because they are consecutive. So three in a row counts as one line.\n\nAnother check: vertical column4:\n\nRows0: 😁\n\nRow1: 😁\n\nRow2: 😁\n\nRow3: 🌻\n\nRow4: 😁\n\nSo rows0-2: three 😁. That's a run of 3. So one line here.\n\nSo vertical lines are indeed 5.\n\nSo total answer is 3 +5 =8.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another line I'm missing. Let me check all rows again.\n\nRow0: 🌻, 😁, 🐧, 😁, 😁. The last two are 😁. So that's a run of 2 → 1.\n\nRow3: 😁, 😁, 🐧, 🐧, 🌻. The first two and then the next two. So two runs → 2.\n\nRow1,2: no runs. Correct.\n\nSo horizontal total 3. Correct.\n\nVertical: 5.\n\nSo 8. But wait, let me check another angle. Let me list all the runs.\n\nHorizontal runs:\n\nRow0: positions3-4 (2) →1.\n\nRow3: positions0-1 (2), positions2-3 (2) →2.\n\nTotal 3.\n\nVertical runs:\n\nColumn0: rows1-3 (3) →1.\n\nColumn1: rows1-2 (2) →1.\n\nColumn2: rows1-2 (2) →1.\n\nColumn3: rows1-4 (4) →1.\n\nColumn4: rows0-2 (3) →1.\n\nSo 5 vertical.\n\nTotal 8.\n\nSo the answer should be 8. But wait, maybe I made a mistake with vertical column2.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: 🐧\n\nRow1: 😁\n\nRow2: 😁\n\nRow3: 🐧\n\nRow4: 😁\n\nSo rows1-2: 😁😁 (run of 2). So that's 1. Correct.\n\nSo yes. Then column2 contributes 1.\n\nYes. So the total is 8. So the answer is 8?\n\n\nThe task is to count horizontal and vertical lines of the same emoji with lengths ≥2. \n\n**Horizontal Lines:**\n- **Row 0:** Ends with `😁😁` (length 2) → 1 line.\n- **Row 3:** Starts with `😁😁` and has `🐧🐧` → 2 lines.\n- Total horizontal lines: 1 (Row 0) + 2 (Row 3) = 3.\n\n**Vertical Lines:**\n- **Column 0:** Rows 1-3 (`😁😁😁`, length 3) → 1 line.\n- **Column 1:** Rows 1-2 (`🐧🐧`, length 2) → 1 line.\n- **Column 2:** Rows 1-2 (`😁😁`, length 2) → 1 line.\n- **Column 3:** Rows 1-4 (`🐧🐧🐧🐧`, length 4) → 1 line.\n- **Column 4:** Rows 0-2 (`😁😁😁`, length 3) → 1 line.\n- Total vertical lines: 5.\n\n**Total Lines:** 3 (horizontal) + 5 (vertical) = 8.\n\nAnswer: 8"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

So the problem is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines made of the same emoji that are at least 2 in length. The board is a 6x6 grid of emojis. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to check each row for horizontal lines. For each row, I look for consecutive emojis. Like, in the first row: 🦖🐫🐼🐼🐼🐺. So here, the three 🐼s in a row would count as a line of length 3. Then, since lines can be of length 2 or more, that counts as one line. Wait, but how do they count overlapping lines? For example, in three same emojis in a row (like the three 🐼), would that count as two lines (length 3) or one? The problem statement says lines of length 2 or more. Wait, no. The wording is \"length of 2 or more\", so each such line that is exactly 2, 3, etc., counts as a separate line. Wait, no. Wait, I think the question is that any consecutive sequence of 2 or more same emojis in a straight line (horizontal or vertical) counts as a line. So a sequence of 3 same emojis in a row would be considered as one line of length 3. But the question is counting the number of lines, not the number of possible sequences. So regardless of the length, each maximal consecutive sequence counts as one line. For example, if there's a row like 🐼🐼🐼, that's a single horizontal line of length 3, so it's counted once. If there's a row like 🐼🐼🦖🦖, that's two horizontal lines (each of length 2) so counts as two.\n\nSo the approach is to scan each row and each column for all consecutive sequences of the same emoji, and count each such sequence as a line if its length is >=2.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Check all horizontal lines (rows)\n   For each row, iterate through each cell and check consecutive same emojis. Group them into runs and count each run with length >=2 as one.\n\n2. Check all vertical lines (columns)\n   For each column, do the same as rows: check consecutive same emojis in the column, group into runs, and count each run of length >=2 as one.\n\nThen sum all these counts.\n\nLet me start with the first row.\n\nRow 0: 🦖🐫🐼🐼🐼🐺\nLooking at the first row:\nIndexes 0-5:\n0: 🦖, 1: 🐫, 2: 🐼, 3: 🐼, 4: 🐼, 5: 🐺\nLooking for consecutive same:\n- From index 0: 🦖 is next to 🐫 (different), so no.\n- Index 1: 🐫 next to 🐼, different.\n- Index 2: 🐼, next is same. So group starts at 2. The next two are same, so run is 2-4 (three emojis). So this is a run of 3, so counts as 1 horizontal line.\n\nSo row 0 contributes 1.\n\nRow 1: 🐺🐼🐫🐺🐼🦖\nIndices 0-5:\n0: 🐺, 1: 🐼, 2: 🐫, 3: 🐺, 4: 🐼, 5: 🦖\nCheck consecutive:\n- 0: next is 🐼, different.\n- 1: next is 🐫, different.\n- 2: next is 🐺, different.\n- 3: next is 🐼, different.\n- 4: next is 🦖, different.\nSo no runs. So row 1 contributes 0.\n\nRow 2: 🐼🐫🦖🐺🦖🐫\nIndices 0-5:\n0: 🐼, 1: 🐫, 2: 🦖, 3: 🐺, 4: 🦖, 5: 🐫\nCheck consecutive:\nNo consecutive same. So row 2 contributes 0.\n\nRow 3: 🐼🐺🐼🐼🐼🦖\nIndices 0-5:\n0: 🐼, 1: 🐺, 2: 🐼, 3: 🐼, 4: 🐼, 5: 🦖\nCheck consecutive:\nFrom index 2, 🐼 next to 🐼. Positions 2-4: three 🐼s. So a run of length 3. Counts as 1. So row 3 contributes 1.\n\nRow 4: 🐫🐼🐫🐼🐼🐺\nIndices 0-5:\n0: 🐫, 1: 🐼, 2: 🐫, 3: 🐼, 4: 🐼, 5: 🐺\nCheck consecutive:\nAt indices 3 and 4: 🐼🐼. So a run of 2. So counts as 1. So row 4 contributes 1.\n\nRow 5: 🦖🦖🐫🐺🐫🦖\nIndices 0-5:\n0: 🦖, 1: 🦖, 2: 🐫, 3: 🐺, 4: 🐫, 5: 🦖\nCheck consecutive:\nAt 0 and 1: two 🦖. So run of 2. Counts as 1. So row 5 contributes 1.\n\nSo total horizontal lines: 1 (row 0) + 0 + 0 + 1 (row3) +1 (row4) +1 (row5) = 4.\n\nNow vertical lines (columns). There are 6 columns (0-5), each 6 rows.\n\nLet's check each column.\n\nColumn 0:\nRow 0: 🦖\nRow 1: 🐺\nRow 2: 🐼\nRow 3: 🐼\nRow 4: 🐫\nRow 5: 🦖\nCheck vertical runs. Each cell in column 0 is different from the next. So no runs here. Column 0 contributes 0.\n\nColumn 1:\nRow 0: 🐫\nRow 1: 🐼\nRow 2: 🐫\nRow 3: 🐺\nRow 4: 🐼\nRow 5: 🦖\nNo consecutive same. So 0.\n\nColumn 2:\nRow 0: 🐼\nRow 1: 🐫\nRow 2: 🦖\nRow 3: 🐼\nRow 4: 🐫\nRow 5: 🐫\nLooking down:\n\nRow 0: 🐼, next (row1) is 🐫. Different. So no run here.\n\nRow1: 🐫 → row2: 🦖. Different.\n\nRow2: 🦖 → row3: 🐼. Different.\n\nRow3: 🐼 → row4: 🐫. Different.\n\nRow4: 🐫 → row5: 🐫. So two same. So in column 2, rows 4 and 5: 🐫🐫. So a run of 2. So this counts as 1. So column 2 contributes 1.\n\nWait, but wait. For vertical columns, we need to check consecutive in the vertical direction. So each consecutive cells in the same column. So for column 2:\n\nRow0: 🐼 (row0, column2)\nRow1: 🐫 (diff)\nRow2: 🦖 (diff)\nRow3: 🐼 (diff)\nRow4: 🐫 (diff)\nRow5: 🐫 (same as row4). So rows4 and 5 in column2 are 🐫 and 🐫. So a run of 2. So yes, that's a vertical line. So column2 contributes 1.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🐼\nRow1: 🐺\nRow2: 🐺\nRow3: 🐼\nRow4: 🐼\nRow5: 🐺\n\nWait, let's list column3:\n\nRow0: column3 is 🐼 (third index is 3? Wait, wait. Wait, each row has 6 elements. Let me recheck the original board:\n\nOriginal board:\n\nRow 0: 🦖 🐫 🐼 🐼 🐼 🐺\nRow 1: 🐺 🐼 🐫 🐺 🐼 🦖\nRow 2: 🐼 🐫 🦖 🐺 🦖 🐫\nRow 3: 🐼 🐺 🐼 🐼 🐼 🦖\nRow 4: 🐫 🐼 🐫 🐼 🐼 🐺\nRow5: 🦖 🦖 🐫 🐺 🐫 🦖\n\nWait, column 3 (index 3) for each row:\n\nRow0: 🐼 (index3)\nRow1: 🐺 (index3)\nRow2: 🐺 (index3)\nRow3: 🐼 (index3)\nRow4: 🐼 (index3)\nRow5: 🐺 (index3)\n\nSo column3 entries are: 🐼, 🐺, 🐺, 🐼, 🐼, 🐺.\n\nCheck vertical runs here:\n\nLooking for consecutive same:\n\nRow0 (🐼) → row1 (🐺) → different.\n\nRow1 (🐺) → row2 (🐺): same. So run starts at row1.\n\nThen row2 (🐺) → row3 (🐼): different. So this is a run of 2 (rows1-2). So counts as 1.\n\nThen row3 (🐼) → row4 (🐼): same. So run starts at row3, continues to row4. Then row4 → row5 (🐺): different. So run of 2 (rows3-4). So another 1.\n\nSo column3 has two vertical lines (each of length 2). So column3 contributes 2.\n\nWait, that's possible. So column3 contributes 2.\n\nColumn4:\n\nLet's check column4 entries:\n\nRow0: 🐼 (index4)\nRow1: 🐼 (index4)\nRow2: 🦖 (index4)\nRow3: 🐼 (index4)\nRow4: 🐼 (index4)\nRow5: 🐫 (index4)\n\nSo column4: 🐼, 🐼, 🦖, 🐼, 🐼, 🐫.\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\nRow0 and 1: same (🐼🐼) → run of 2 → counts as 1.\n\nRow1 → row2: different (🦖).\n\nRow2 → row3: different (🐼).\n\nRow3 → row4: same (🐼🐼) → run of 2 → counts as 1.\n\nRow4 → row5: different (🐫).\n\nSo column4 has two runs of 2 each. So column4 contributes 2.\n\nColumn5:\n\nEntries for column5:\n\nRow0: 🐺\nRow1: 🦖\nRow2: 🐫\nRow3: 🦖\nRow4: 🐺\nRow5: 🦖\n\nNo consecutive same in any two rows. So column5 contributes 0.\n\nNow summing up vertical lines:\n\nColumn0:0, column1:0, column2:1, column3:2, column4:2, column5:0. Total vertical lines: 1+2+2=5.\n\nWait 0+0+1+2+2+0 = 5.\n\nSo total vertical lines are 5.\n\nAdding horizontal (4) and vertical (5) gives total lines 4+5=9.\n\nWait but wait, let me recheck each column again to avoid mistakes.\n\nLet me re-examine column3 again.\n\nColumn3 entries:\n\nRow0: 🐼, row1: 🐺, row2: 🐺, row3: 🐼, row4: 🐼, row5: 🐺.\n\nSo looking for consecutive runs:\n\nRow1 and row2: 🐺 and 🐺 → run of 2 (rows1-2). Count 1.\n\nRows3 and 4: 🐼 and 🐼 → run of 2 (rows3-4). Count another 1. So total 2.\n\nYes, that's correct. So column3 is 2.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRows0 and 1: 🐼 and 🐼 → count 1.\n\nThen rows3 and 4: 🐼 and 🐼 → count another 1. So column4 is 2.\n\nColumn2: rows4 and 5 are 🐫 and 🐫. So run of 2. So 1.\n\nSo vertical is 5.\n\nSo yes.\n\nSo total lines: horizontal 4, vertical 5. Total 9.\n\nWait, but let me check again the rows for possible other runs. Did I miss any?\n\nRow0: 3 in a row → 1.\n\nRow3: 3 in a row → 1.\n\nRow4: two in a row (🐼🐼) → 1.\n\nRow5: two 🦖 → 1.\n\nTotal horizontal 4. Correct.\n\nVertical:\n\nColumn3: 2 runs.\n\nColumn4: 2 runs.\n\nColumn2: 1 run.\n\nSo 2+2+1=5. Correct.\n\nYes. So total 9.\n\n\nThe task is to count horizontal and vertical lines of the same emoji with a length of 2 or more. \n\n**Horizontal Lines:**\n- **Row 0:** Three consecutive 🐼 → 1 line.\n- **Row 3:** Three consecutive 🐼 → 1 line.\n- **Row 4:** Two consecutive 🐼 → 1 line.\n- **Row 5:** Two consecutive 🦖 → 1 line.\n- **Total horizontal:** 4 lines.\n\n**Vertical Lines:**\n- **Column 2:** Two consecutive 🐫 → 1 line.\n- **Column 3:** Two runs of two 🐺 and two 🐼 → 2 lines.\n- **Column 4:** Two runs of two 🐼 → 2 lines.\n- **Total vertical:** 5 lines.\n\n**Total Lines:** 4 (horizontal) + 5 (vertical) = 9.\n\nAnswer: 9"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines made of the same emoji with length 2 or more on this board. Hmm. So first, I should probably look at each row for horizontal lines and each column for vertical lines. Then check sequences of the same emoji and see how many lines they form.\n\nLet me start by looking at each row one by one.\n\nFirst row: 🦞🐆🐆🐛🐆🐆\nSo looking for consecutive same emojis. Let's break it down:\n- The first emoji is 🦞, then 🐆, which is different. So nothing here.\n- Next two 🐆s. That's a length 2. So that's one horizontal line.\n- Then 🐛, which is different. Then two 🐆s again. Another horizontal line of length 2. So in the first row, there are two horizontal lines. Wait, but wait, the first row's emojis are 🦞, then two 🐆, then a 🐛, then two 🐆. So the two 🐆 are two separate pairs? Or is there a longer sequence? Let me check. The first two 🐆 are positions 2 and 3. Then after the 🐛, positions 5 and 6 are 🐆 again. So two separate pairs. Each of length 2. So that's two horizontal lines here.\n\nSecond row: 🌊🐆🦞🦞🌊🌙\nBreaking down:\n- 🌊 is first. Next is 🐆, different. So nothing here.\n- Then 🐆 (position 2) is alone. Next is 🦞🦞 (positions 3 and 4). That's a horizontal line of length 2. Then 🌊 (position 5) is alone. Then 🌙 (6). So one horizontal line here.\n\nThird row: 🌊🦞🌊🐆🦞🌙\nLooking for consecutive same. Let's see:\n- 🌊, then 🦞, then 🌊 again. No consecutive same here. Then 🐆, 🦞, 🌙. So no consecutive same emojis in this row. So no horizontal lines here.\n\nFourth row: 🐆🦞🌊🌊🐆🐛\nIn this row:\n- First 🐆, then 🦞, different. Then 🌊🌊 (positions 3 and 4). That's a horizontal line of length 2. Then 🐆 (position5) and 🐛 (6) are different. So one horizontal line here.\n\nFifth row: 🌙🌙🌊🌊🐛🌙\nBreakdown:\n- 🌙🌙 (positions 1 and 2) → length 2.\n- Then 🌊🌊 (positions 3 and 4) → another length 2.\n- Then 🐛 and 🌙 are different. So two horizontal lines here.\n\nSixth row: 🌊🌙🌊🐛🐆🌊\nChecking each pair:\n- 🌊, then 🌙 (different). Then 🌊 (position3) alone. Then 🐛, 🐆, 🌊 (position6). No consecutive same. So no horizontal lines here.\n\nSo total horizontal lines: 2 (row1) +1 (row2)+1 (row4)+2 (row5) = 6 horizontal lines.\n\nNow check vertical lines. Need to look at each column and check sequences in columns.\n\nThe board has 6 rows and 6 columns. Let's go column by column.\n\nColumn 1:\nRow1: 🦞\nRow2: 🌊\nRow3: 🌊\nRow4: 🐆\nRow5: 🌙\nRow6: 🌊\nSo all different. No vertical lines here.\n\nColumn2:\nRow1: 🐆\nRow2: 🐆\nRow3: 🦞\nRow4: 🦞\nRow5: 🌙\nRow6: 🌙\nSo looking for sequences. Let's see:\nRow1 and 2: 🐆🐆 → length 2. Then row3 is 🦞. So that's a vertical line of length 2 in column2. Then rows5 and 6 are 🌙🌙 → another vertical line of length 2. So column2 has two vertical lines.\n\nWait, but vertical lines are sequences in the column. So for column2, positions 1-2: 🐆🐆 (length 2 → count 1). Positions 5-6: 🌙🌙 (length 2 → count 1). So total of 2 vertical lines in column2.\n\nColumn3:\nRow1: 🐆\nRow2: 🦞\nRow3: 🌊\nRow4: 🌊\nRow5: 🌊\nRow6: 🌊\nSo row3 to row6: four 🌊 in a row? Wait:\n\nRow3's column3 is 🌊. Row4's column3 is 🌊. So positions3 and4. Then row5's column3 is 🌊 (so positions3-5). Row6's column3 is also 🌊 (positions3-6). So the entire column3 from row3 to row6 is 4 consecutive 🌊. So that's one vertical line of length 4. But any longer lines would include multiple possible lines. But the problem says to count lines of length 2 or more. So in this column, the vertical line is of length 4. Each consecutive sequence of same emoji counts as a single line. So for example, in a column like A, A, A, there's one line of length3, which counts as a single line. So the column3 here has one vertical line of length4 → counts as 1.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". So each line is a consecutive sequence. So for example, in a column with A, A, A, there's one line of length3. So each consecutive same emoji sequence contributes one line. So for column3, the four 🌊s in a row (rows3-6) → one vertical line of length4. So that counts as 1.\n\nBut earlier in column2, there were two separate sequences (🐆🐆 and 🌙🌙) → two vertical lines. So that's correct.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow1: 🐛\nRow2: 🦞\nRow3: 🐆\nRow4: 🌊\nRow5: 🌊\nRow6: 🐛\nSo column4:\n\nRow1: 🐛\nRow2: 🦞 (different)\nSo no. Then row3 is 🐆. Row4 and 5 are 🌊🌊 (length 2). Then row6 is 🐛. So in column4, the vertical lines are the 🌊🌊 in rows4-5 → one vertical line of length2.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow1: 🐆\nRow2: 🌊\nRow3: 🦞\nRow4: 🐆\nRow5: 🐛\nRow6: 🐆\nLooking for same consecutive:\n\nRow1 is 🐆, row2 is 🌊 (different). Then row3: 🦞. Row4: 🐆. Row5: 🐛. Row6: 🐆. No consecutive same emojis. So no vertical lines here.\n\nColumn6:\n\nRow1: 🐆\nRow2: 🌙\nRow3: 🌙\nRow4: 🐛\nRow5: 🌙\nRow6: 🌊\nCheck:\n\nRow2 and 3: 🌙🌙 → vertical line of length2. Then row5 is 🌙, but row4 is 🐛. So rows2-3: one vertical line. So column6 → 1 vertical line.\n\nSo summing up the vertical lines:\n\nColumn2: 2 lines (🐆🐆 and 🌙🌙)\nColumn3: 1 line (🌊 four times)\nColumn4: 1 line (🌊🌊)\nColumn6: 1 line (🌙🌙)\nOther columns (1,5) have none.\n\nTotal vertical lines: 2 +1 +1 +1 =5?\n\nWait, column2: two lines, column3: 1, column4:1, column6:1 → 2+1+1+1=5?\n\nWait, 2 (column2) + 1 (column3) → 3 so far. Then column4:1 → 4. column6:1 → total 5.\n\nSo vertical lines total 5. Then horizontal lines were 6. So total is 6+5=11? But wait, let me recount.\n\nWait, horizontal lines:\n\nRow1: two lines (🐆🐆 and 🐆🐆)\nRow2: one line (🦞🦞)\nRow4: one line (🌊🌊)\nRow5: two lines (🌙🌙 and 🌊🌊)\nTotal: 2+1+1+2=6.\n\nVertical lines:\n\nColumn2: two lines (🐆🐆 and 🌙🌙)\nColumn3: one line (🌊 x4)\nColumn4: one line (🌊 x2)\nColumn6: one line (🌙 x2)\nSo column2: 2, others: 1 each. So 2+1+1+1 =5.\n\nTotal lines:6+5=11. So answer is 11?\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, column3's vertical line is 4 in a row. So that's one line. Correct.\n\nColumn4's vertical line is rows4 and5 (🌊🌊). So that's one.\n\nColumn6's vertical line is rows2 and3 (🌙🌙). Correct.\n\nColumn2's vertical lines are rows1-2 (🐆🐆) and rows5-6 (🌙🌙). So two separate lines. So yes, two.\n\nSo vertical count is 2+1+1+1 =5.\n\nHorizontal lines: row1 has two (two pairs), row2 one, row4 one, row5 two. Total 6.\n\nSo 6+5=11. Answer is 11. But wait, maybe I missed some.\n\nWait, let me check each row again for horizontal lines.\n\nRow1: 🦞🐆🐆🐛🐆🐆 → sequences: the first two 🐆 (positions2-3) → length2. Then after the 🐛 (position4), positions5-6 are 🐆🐆 → another length2. So two lines here. Correct.\n\nRow2: 🌊🐆🦞🦞🌊🌙 → positions3-4: 🦞🦞 → length2. One line. Correct.\n\nRow3: 🌊🦞🌊🐆🦞🌙 → no consecutive same. Correct.\n\nRow4: 🐆🦞🌊🌊🐆🐛 → positions3-4: 🌊🌊 → one line.\n\nRow5: 🌙🌙🌊🌊🐛🌙 → positions1-2: 🌙🌙, positions3-4: 🌊🌊 → two lines.\n\nRow6: no lines. Correct.\n\nSo horizontal lines total 6.\n\nVertical lines:\n\nColumn1: no.\n\nColumn2: rows1-2: 🐆🐆 (length2) → counts as 1 line. Rows5-6: 🌙🌙 (length2) → another line. So two lines. Yes.\n\nColumn3: rows3-6: 🌊 four times → one line.\n\nColumn4: rows4-5: 🌊🌊 → one line.\n\nColumn5: no.\n\nColumn6: rows2-3: 🌙🌙 → one line.\n\nSo vertical lines: 2 +1 +1 +1 =5.\n\nSo total 6+5=11. So the answer is 11.\n\nWait, but let me check for column3 again. Are the four in a row counted as a single line? Yes, because a line is any consecutive same emojis, regardless of longer length. Each such consecutive sequence counts once. So length 4 counts as one line. So yes.\n\nAnother thing to check: in vertical column6, rows2-3 are 🌙🌙. So that's one line. Correct.\n\nSo all counts seem correct. So the answer is 11.\n\n\nThe board is analyzed by checking each row for horizontal lines and each column for vertical lines where the same emoji appears consecutively two or more times. \n\n**Horizontal Lines:**\n- **Row 1:** 🦞🐆🐆🐛🐆🐆 → Two pairs of 🐆 (positions 2-3 and 5-6) → 2 lines.\n- **Row 2:** 🌊🐆🦞🦞🌊🌙 → One pair of 🦞 (positions 3-4) → 1 line.\n- **Row 3:** 🌊🦞🌊🐆🦞🌙 → No consecutive matches → 0 lines.\n- **Row 4:** 🐆🦞🌊🌊🐆🐛 → One pair of 🌊 (positions 3-4) → 1 line.\n- **Row 5:** 🌙🌙🌊🌊🐛🌙 → Two pairs (🌙🌙 and 🌊🌊) → 2 lines.\n- **Row 6:** 🌊🌙🌊🐛🐆🌊 → No consecutive matches → 0 lines.  \n**Total horizontal lines:** 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6.\n\n**Vertical Lines:**\n- **Column 1:** All unique → 0 lines.\n- **Column 2:** 🐆🐆 (rows 1-2) and 🌙🌙 (rows 5-6) → 2 lines.\n- **Column 3:** 🌊🌊🌊🌊 (rows 3-6) → 1 line (length 4).\n- **Column 4:** 🌊🌊 (rows 4-5) → 1 line.\n- **Column 5:** All unique → 0 lines.\n- **Column 6:** 🌙🌙 (rows 2-3) → 1 line.  \n**Total vertical lines:** 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\n**Total lines:** 6 (horizontal) + 5 (vertical) = **11**.  \nAnswer: 11"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines made by the same emoji with length 2 or more in this board. Hmm. The board is 10x10, right? Each cell is an emoji. So for each row and column, I need to check sequences of the same emoji. \n\nFirst, let's tackle the rows. For each row, I'll look for consecutive same emojis. Like, if a row has 🐓🐓🦐, that's a horizontal line of 2 for 🐓. But how do I count overlapping lines? Wait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with length 2 or more\". So each maximal sequence of the same emoji contributes one line. For example, a sequence of 3 same emojis would count as 1 line (since it's a single line of length 3), not two (like 2 and 2 overlapping). Wait, no. Wait, maybe not. Let me think. For example, in a row like A A A, that's a line of length 3. The problem counts each line as any consecutive same emojis in a row. So for each row, I need to check all possible consecutive sequences. But the question is, how does the counting work? If there's a sequence of 4 same emojis, how many lines of length >=2 are there?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So each line is a straight line (horizontal or vertical) of the same emoji, with length at least 2. So each such line is counted once. For example, a horizontal line of 4 same emojis would contribute 1 line (since it's a single horizontal line of length 4). Similarly, if a row has two separate sequences of same emojis, like A A B B, then that's two lines (each of length 2). So the approach is: for each row and column, scan for consecutive same emojis, group them into maximal sequences, and for each such group of length >=2, add 1 to the count. Then sum all those counts for all rows and columns.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, \"lines\" can be horizontal or vertical. So for example, in a row, each maximal sequence of the same emoji of length >=2 counts as one horizontal line. Similarly, in a column, each such sequence counts as a vertical line.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each row, check every consecutive sequence. For each run of the same emoji, if the run length is >=2, add 1 to the total count. So for a run of 3, that's one line. For a run of 4, one line. So in a row like A A A B B, that's two lines (A's and B's).\n\n2. Do the same for each column. For each column, check the runs of same emojis. Each run of length >=2 adds 1 to the count.\n\nSo the total is the sum of all horizontal runs (rows) and vertical runs (columns) that are at least length 2.\n\nSo now I need to process each row and each column of the given board.\n\nThe given board is 10x10. Let's look at the rows first.\n\nFirst, let's list out the rows. There are 10 rows. Let's take them one by one.\n\nRow 1: 🐓🦐🦨🦮💫🦮🦐🦨🌕💫\nLooking for consecutive same emojis. Let's check each emoji in order:\n\n1. 🐓 (index 0)\nNext is 🦐 (1) → different. So run length 1 → no count.\n2. 🦐 (1) → next is 🦨 (2) → different. Run length 1 → no.\n3. 🦨 (2) → next is 🦮 (3) → different. Run 1 → no.\n4. 🦮 (3) → next 💫 (4) → different. Run 1 → no.\n5. 💫 (4) → next 🦮 (5) → different. Run 1 → no.\n6. 🦮 (5) → next 🦐 (6) → different. Run 1 → no.\n7. 🦐 (6) → next 🦨 (7) → different. Run 1 → no.\n8. 🦨 (7) → next 🌕 (8) → different. Run 1 → no.\n9. 🌕 (8) → next 💫 (9) → different. Run 1 → no.\nSo row 1 has 0 horizontal lines.\n\nRow 2: 🦮🌕🦨🦐🌕🐓💫🦐🦐🐓\nCheck consecutive:\n1. 🦮 (0) → next 🌕 (1) → different. Run 1.\n2. 🌕 (1) → next 🦨 (2) → different. Run 1.\n3. 🦨 (2) → next 🦐 (3) → different. Run 1.\n4. 🦐 (3) → next 🌕 (4) → different. Run 1.\n5. 🌕 (4) → next 🐓 (5) → different. Run 1.\n6. 🐓 (5) → next 💫 (6) → different. Run 1.\n7. 💫 (6) → next 🦐 (7) → different. Run 1.\n8. 🦐 (7) → next 🦐 (8) → same! So run starts here. Then next (9) is 🐓. So run length 2 (indices 7-8). So this counts as 1 line.\n9. 🦐 (8) → done. So row 2 has 1 horizontal line (the two 🦐s).\n\nRow 3: 🦨🦭🦭🐰💫💫🐓🐓🦭🦭\nCheck:\n1. 🦨 (0) → next 🦭 (1) → different. Run 1.\n2. 🦭 (1) → next 🦭 (2) → same. Run starts. Next is 🐰 (3). So run length 2 → 1 line.\n3. 🐰 (3) → next 💫 (4) → different. Run 1.\n4. 💫 (4) → next 💫 (5) → same. Next is 🐓 (6). Run length 2 → 1 line.\n5. 🐓 (6) → next 🐓 (7) → same. Next is 🦭 (8). Run length 2 → 1 line.\n6. 🦭 (8) → next 🦭 (9) → same. Run length 2 → 1 line.\nSo row 3 has 4 horizontal lines (from positions 1-2, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9).\n\nRow 4: 🦮🦮🐰🦐🐓🦮🦐🦭💫🐓\nCheck:\n1. 🦮 (0) → next 🦮 (1) → same. Then next is 🐰 (2). Run length 2 → 1 line.\n2. 🐰 (2) → next 🦐 (3) → different. Run 1.\n3. 🦐 (3) → next 🐓 (4) → different. Run 1.\n4. 🐓 (4) → next 🦮 (5) → different. Run 1.\n5. 🦮 (5) → next 🦐 (6) → different. Run 1.\n6. 🦐 (6) → next 🦭 (7) → different. Run 1.\n7. 🦭 (7) → next 💫 (8) → different. Run 1.\n8. 💫 (8) → next 🐓 (9) → different. Run 1.\nSo row 4 has 1 horizontal line (the two 🦮s at start).\n\nRow 5: 🦨🐰🦮🐰🐓🐰🦨💫🐰🦐\nCheck each consecutive:\n1. 🦨 (0) → next 🐰 (1) → different. Run 1.\n2. 🐰 (1) → next 🦮 (2) → different. Run 1.\n3. 🦮 (2) → next 🐰 (3) → different. Run 1.\n4. 🐰 (3) → next 🐓 (4) → different. Run 1.\n5. 🐓 (4) → next 🐰 (5) → different. Run 1.\n6. 🐰 (5) → next 🦨 (6) → different. Run 1.\n7. 🦨 (6) → next 💫 (7) → different. Run 1.\n8. 💫 (7) → next 🐰 (8) → different. Run 1.\n9. 🐰 (8) → next 🦐 (9) → different. Run 1.\nSo row 5 has 0 horizontal lines.\n\nRow 6: 💫🦭💫🦐🦐🦮🦐🦮🦐🐓\nCheck:\n1. 💫 (0) → next 🦭 (1) → different. Run 1.\n2. 🦭 (1) → next 💫 (2) → different. Run 1.\n3. 💫 (2) → next 🦐 (3) → different. Run 1.\n4. 🦐 (3) → next 🦐 (4) → same. Next is 🦮 (5). Run length 2 → 1 line.\n5. 🦐 (4) → next 🦮 (5) → different. Run 1.\n6. 🦮 (5) → next 🦐 (6) → different. Run 1.\n7. 🦐 (6) → next 🦮 (7) → different. Run 1.\n8. 🦮 (7) → next 🦐 (8) → different. Run 1.\n9. 🦐 (8) → next 🐓 (9) → different. Run 1.\nSo row 6 has 1 horizontal line (two 🦐s at positions 3-4).\n\nRow 7: 🦭🐓🦐🦨🐰🦮🦮🌕🦨🐓\nCheck:\n1. 🦭 (0) → next 🐓 (1) → different. Run 1.\n2. 🐓 (1) → next 🦐 (2) → different. Run 1.\n3. 🦐 (2) → next 🦨 (3) → different. Run 1.\n4. 🦨 (3) → next 🐰 (4) → different. Run 1.\n5. 🐰 (4) → next 🦮 (5) → different. Run 1.\n6. 🦮 (5) → next 🦮 (6) → same. Next is 🌕 (7). Run length 2 → 1 line.\n7. 🦮 (6) → next 🌕 (7) → different. Run 1.\n8. 🌕 (7) → next 🦨 (8) → different. Run 1.\n9. 🦨 (8) → next 🐓 (9) → different. Run 1.\nSo row 7 has 1 horizontal line (two 🦮s at 5-6).\n\nRow 8: 🦨💫💫🐓🦨🐰🦨🦐🌕🦐\nCheck:\n1. 🦨 (0) → next 💫 (1) → different. Run 1.\n2. 💫 (1) → next 💫 (2) → same. Then next 🐓 (3). Run length 2 → 1 line.\n3. 🐓 (3) → next 🦨 (4) → different. Run 1.\n4. 🦨 (4) → next 🐰 (5) → different. Run 1.\n5. 🐰 (5) → next 🦨 (6) → different. Run 1.\n6. 🦨 (6) → next 🦐 (7) → different. Run 1.\n7. 🦐 (7) → next 🌕 (8) → different. Run 1.\n8. 🌕 (8) → next 🦐 (9) → different. Run 1.\nSo row 8 has 1 horizontal line (two 💫s at 1-2).\n\nRow 9: 🌕💫🦐🦮🦐🦮🐰💫🦐💫\nCheck:\n1. 🌕 (0) → next 💫 (1) → different. Run 1.\n2. 💫 (1) → next 🦐 (2) → different. Run 1.\n3. 🦐 (2) → next 🦮 (3) → different. Run 1.\n4. 🦮 (3) → next 🦐 (4) → different. Run 1.\n5. 🦐 (4) → next 🦮 (5) → different. Run 1.\n6. 🦮 (5) → next 🐰 (6) → different. Run 1.\n7. 🐰 (6) → next 💫 (7) → different. Run 1.\n8. 💫 (7) → next 🦐 (8) → different. Run 1.\n9. 🦐 (8) → next 💫 (9) → different. Run 1.\nSo row 9 has 0 horizontal lines.\n\nRow 10: 🐰💫🦨🐓💫🦮🐰🦨💫💫\nCheck:\n1. 🐰 (0) → next 💫 (1) → different. Run 1.\n2. 💫 (1) → next 🦨 (2) → different. Run 1.\n3. 🦨 (2) → next 🐓 (3) → different. Run 1.\n4. 🐓 (3) → next 💫 (4) → different. Run 1.\n5. 💫 (4) → next 🦮 (5) → different. Run 1.\n6. 🦮 (5) → next 🐰 (6) → different. Run 1.\n7. 🐰 (6) → next 🦨 (7) → different. Run 1.\n8. 🦨 (7) → next 💫 (8) → different. Run 1.\n9. 💫 (8) → next 💫 (9) → same. Run length 2 → 1 line.\nSo row 10 has 1 horizontal line (two 💫s at 8-9).\n\nSo summing up the horizontal lines: \n\nRow 1: 0\n\nRow 2: 1\n\nRow 3: 4\n\nRow 4: 1\n\nRow 5: 0\n\nRow 6: 1\n\nRow 7: 1\n\nRow 8: 1\n\nRow 9: 0\n\nRow 10: 1\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 0+1+4+1+0+1+1+1+0+1= 10.\n\nNow for the vertical lines. Each column has 10 cells. Let's process each column from 0 to 9.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRows 1-10, column 0:\n\nRow 1: 🐓\n\nRow 2: 🦮\n\nRow 3: 🦨\n\nRow 4: 🦮\n\nRow 5: 🦨\n\nRow 6: 💫\n\nRow 7: 🦭\n\nRow 8: 🦨\n\nRow 9: 🌕\n\nRow10: 🐰\n\nSo the sequence is: 🐓, 🦮, 🦨, 🦮, 🦨, 💫, 🦭, 🦨, 🌕, 🐰. \n\nCheck vertical runs. Let's see:\n\nLooking for consecutive same emojis in this column.\n\n1. 🐓 (row1) → different from next (row2's 🦮). So run 1.\n\n2. 🦮 (row2) → next is row3's 🦨 → different. Run 1.\n\n3. 🦨 (row3) → next row4's 🦮 → different. Run 1.\n\n4. 🦮 (row4) → next row5's 🦨 → different. Run 1.\n\n5. 🦨 (row5) → next row6's 💫 → different. Run 1.\n\n6. 💫 (row6) → next row7's 🦭 → different. Run 1.\n\n7. 🦭 (row7) → next row8's 🦨 → different. Run 1.\n\n8. 🦨 (row8) → next row9's 🌕 → different. Run 1.\n\n9. 🌕 (row9) → next row10's 🐰 → different. Run 1.\n\nNo runs of >=2. So column 0 contributes 0.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow1: 🦐\n\nRow2: 🌕\n\nRow3: 🦭\n\nRow4: 🦮\n\nRow5: 🐰\n\nRow6: 🦭\n\nRow7: 🐓\n\nRow8: 💫\n\nRow9: 💫\n\nRow10: 💫\n\nSequence: 🦐, 🌕, 🦭, 🦮, 🐰, 🦭, 🐓, 💫, 💫, 💫.\n\nCheck for runs:\n\n1. 🦐 → 🌕 → different.\n\n2. 🌕 → 🦭 → different.\n\n3. 🦭 → 🦮 → different.\n\n4. 🦮 → 🐰 → different.\n\n5. 🐰 → 🦭 → different.\n\n6. 🦭 → 🐓 → different.\n\n7. 🐓 → 💫 → different.\n\n8. 💫 (row8) → next row9's 💫 → same. Then row10's 💫 → same. So run starts here. Let's see:\n\nPositions 8 (row8), 9 (row9), 10 (row10) in the column. Wait, rows are 1-10 (index 0 to 9 in code). So in column 1, rows 0-9 (assuming zero-based in code). Wait, perhaps I should index rows from 0 to 9. Wait, the initial data has rows 1-10, but in code, perhaps rows are zero-based. Let's clarify:\n\nThe input lists rows as:\n\nboard:\n\nRow1: ... (index 0)\n\nRow2: ... (index 1)\n\n...\n\nRow10: ... (index 9)\n\nSo each column is from row 0 to row 9.\n\nSo for column 1 (second column, index 1):\n\nThe emojis are:\n\nRow0: 🦐 (row1 in the user's input?)\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing. The user provided the board with 10 rows. Let's clarify: when the user lists the board, the first line after 'board:' is the first row (row index 0?), then the second line is row index 1, etc. So for processing columns, each column is a list of row[0], row[1], ..., row[9] of that column.\n\nSo for column 0: row0's first emoji, row1's first emoji, ..., row9's first emoji.\n\nSo column 1 (index 1):\n\nrows 0 to 9:\n\nRow0 (user's first line): 🐓🦐🦨🦮💫🦮🦐🦨🌕💫 → index 1 is 🦐.\n\nRow1: 🦮🌕🦨🦐🌕🐓💫🦐🦐🐓 → index1 is 🌕.\n\nRow2: 🦨🦭🦭🐰💫💫🐓🐓🦭🦭 → index1 is 🦭.\n\nRow3: 🦮🦮🐰🦐🐓🦮🦐🦭💫🐓 → index1 is 🦮.\n\nRow4: 🦨🐰🦮🐰🐓🐰🦨💫🐰🦐 → index1 is 🐰.\n\nRow5: 💫🦭💫🦐🦐🦮🦐🦮🦐🐓 → index1 is 🦭.\n\nRow6: 🦭🐓🦐🦨🐰🦮🦮🌕🦨🐓 → index1 is 🐓.\n\nRow7: 🦨💫💫🐓🦨🐰🦨🦐🌕🦐 → index1 is 💫.\n\nRow8: 🌕💫🦐🦮🦐🦮🐰💫🦐💫 → index1 is 💫.\n\nRow9: 🐰💫🦨🐓💫🦮🐰🦨💫💫 → index1 is 💫.\n\nSo column1's emojis are:\n\nrow0: 🦐 → row1: 🌕 → row2: 🦭 → row3: 🦮 → row4: 🐰 → row5: 🦭 → row6: 🐓 → row7: 💫 → row8: 💫 → row9: 💫.\n\nSo looking for runs:\n\nStarting from row0:\n\n🦐 (0) → different from row1's 🌕.\n\nrow1's 🌕 → different from row2's 🦭.\n\nrow2's 🦭 → different from row3's 🦮.\n\nrow3's 🦮 → different from row4's 🐰.\n\nrow4's 🐰 → different from row5's 🦭.\n\nrow5's 🦭 → different from row6's 🐓.\n\nrow6's 🐓 → different from row7's 💫.\n\nrow7's 💫 → same as row8's 💫. Then row9's 💫. So the run is from row7 to row9: length 3. That's one vertical line.\n\nSo column1 contributes 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn2 (index2):\n\nLet's list the emojis in column2 for each row.\n\nrow0: 🦨 → row1: 🦨 → row2: 🦭 → row3: 🐰 → row4: 🦮 → row5: 💫 → row6: 🦐 → row7: 💫 → row8: 🦐 → row9: 🦨.\n\nSo the sequence: 🦨 (0), 🦨 (1), 🦭 (2), 🐰 (3), 🦮 (4), 💫 (5), 🦐 (6), 💫 (7), 🦐 (8), 🦨 (9).\n\nCheck for runs:\n\nrow0's 🦨 (0) → same as row1's 🦨 (1). Then row2's 🦭 (different). So run from 0-1 → length 2 → 1 vertical line.\n\nrow1's 🦨 (1) → already part of the previous run.\n\nrow2's 🦭 (2) → different from row3's 🐰.\n\nrow3's 🐰 (3) → different from row4's 🦮.\n\nrow4's 🦮 (4) → different from row5's 💫.\n\nrow5's 💫 (5) → different from row6's 🦐.\n\nrow6's 🦐 (6) → different from row7's 💫.\n\nrow7's 💫 (7) → different from row8's 🦐.\n\nrow8's 🦐 (8) → different from row9's 🦨.\n\nSo column2 has 1 vertical line (rows0-1: two 🦨s).\n\nColumn3 (index3):\n\nRow0: 🦮 → row1: 🦐 → row2: 🦭 → row3: 🦐 → row4: 🐰 → row5: 🦐 → row6: 🦨 → row7: 🐓 → row8: 🦮 → row9: 🐓.\n\nSequence: 🦮, 🦐, 🦭, 🦐, 🐰, 🦐, 🦨, 🐓, 🦮, 🐓.\n\nCheck runs:\n\nEach consecutive pair:\n\nrow0: 🦮 → next row1's 🦐 → different.\n\nrow1's 🦐 → next row2's 🦭 → different.\n\nrow2's 🦭 → next row3's 🦐 → different.\n\nrow3's 🦐 → next row4's 🐰 → different.\n\nrow4's 🐰 → next row5's 🦐 → different.\n\nrow5's 🦐 → next row6's 🦨 → different.\n\nrow6's 🦨 → next row7's 🐓 → different.\n\nrow7's 🐓 → next row8's 🦮 → different.\n\nrow8's 🦮 → next row9's 🐓 → different.\n\nNo runs >=2.

Let's recount:\n\nWait columns:\n\nColumn1:1\n\nColumn2:1\n\nColumn4:1\n\nColumn5:2\n\nColumn6:1\n\nColumn9:2\n\nSo 1+1=2, +1=3, +2=5, +1=6, +2=8. So 8 vertical lines.\n\nSo the total lines are horizontal (10) + vertical (8) = 18.\n\nBut wait, let me recheck the vertical lines count.\n\nWait columns:\n\nColumn0:0\n\nColumn1:1\n\nColumn2:1 → total 2\n\nColumn3:0 → 2\n\nColumn4:1 → 3\n\nColumn5:2 →5\n\nColumn6:1 →6\n\nColumn7:0 →6\n\nColumn8:0 →6\n\nColumn9:2 →8\n\nTotal vertical is 8.\n\nSo 10+8=18.

That's a run of 2 → count 1.\n\nrow8 (8) is 🦮, row9 is 🦮 → same. Another run of 2 → count 1.\n\nOthers: row0's 🦮 (0) → row1's 🐓 → different. row3's 🦮 → row4's 🐰 → different. So total 2 for column5. Correct.\n\nColumn9's runs:\n\nrow5: 🐓, row6: 🐓 → run of 2 (rows5 and 6 are indexes 5 and 6 in the column (rows 5 and 6 in the input).\n\nrow8 and row9 (indexes 8 and 9 in the column) → 💫 and 💫. So two runs. Correct.\n\nSo vertical count is 8.\n\nHmm. So total answer is 10+8=18.\n\nWait, but let me check the vertical columns again.\n\nColumn5: rows5 and 6 are indexes5 and 6 in the column (original rows 6 and 7).\n\nIn column5, row5 (original row6) is 🦮 and row6 (original row7) is 🦮. So run of 2. Yes.\n\nSo vertical count for column5 is 2. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, column9 has two runs: rows5-6 (🐓🐓) and rows8-9 (💫💫). So two. Correct.\n\nSo vertical total 8.\n\nSo horizontal lines: 10. Vertical: 8. Total 18.\n\nBut wait, let me recheck the horizontal count again. Let me recheck each row.\n\nRow 2: 🦮🌕🦨🦐🌕🐓💫🦐🦐🐓 → two 🦐 at positions7-8. So yes, 1 line.\n\nRow3: 🦨🦭🦭🐰💫💫🐓🐓🦭🦭 → four lines: 🦭🦭 (1-2), 💫💫 (4-5), 🐓🐓 (6-7), 🦭🦭 (8-9). Yes, 4 lines.\n\nRow4: 🦮🦮🐰🦐🐓🦮🦐🦭💫🐓 → two 🦮 at 0-1 → 1 line.\n\nRow6: 💫🦭💫🦐🦐🦮🦐🦮🦐🐓 → two 🦐 at 3-4 → 1 line.\n\nRow7: 🦭🐓🦐🦨🐰🦮🦮🌕🦨🐓 → two 🦮 at5-6 →1 line.\n\nRow8: 🦨💫💫🐓🦨🐰🦨🦐🌕🦐 → two 💫 at1-2 →1 line.\n\nRow10 (user's last row, index9 in code): 🐰💫🦨🐓💫🦮🐰🦨💫💫 → two 💫 at8-9 (positions 8 and9 in the row) →1 line.\n\nYes, sum is 0+1+4+1+0+1+1+1+0+1 = 10.\n\nVertical columns:\n\nColumn1: 💫💫💫 in rows7-9 (indices7-9 in the column). But wait, row7's column1 is 💫, row8's column1 is 💫, row9's column1 is 💫. So that's a run of 3 → counts as 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn2: rows0-1 (indices0 and1) are 🦨🦨 → 1.\n\nColumn4: rows3-4 (indices3 and4) are 🐓🐓 →1.\n\nColumn5: rows5-6 and 8-9 → 2.\n\nColumn6: rows8-9 (indices8-9) are 🐰🐰 →1.\n\nColumn9: rows5-6 (🐓🐓) and8-9 (💫💫) → 2.\n\nSo vertical total: column1(1), column2(1), column4(1), column5(2), column6(1), column9(2) → sum is 1+1+1+2+1+2= 8.\n\nYes.

I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines of the same emoji with a length of 2 or more on this board. Hmm. The board is 10x10 since there are 10 rows each with 10 emojis. \n\nFirst, I should probably check each row for consecutive emojis. For horizontal lines. Then check each column for vertical lines. And lines can be longer than 2, but each segment of 2 or more counts as a line. Wait, but what counts as a line? Like, if there's a line of 3, that's two overlapping lines of 2, but I think the problem counts each possible line of length 2 or longer. Wait no, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more.\" So each continuous sequence of the same emoji of length ≥2 counts as one line. So a sequence of 4 same emojis in a row would count as one line, not two (because 4-2+1=3 possible lines, but maybe the problem counts each maximal line once). Wait, maybe I need to clarify. The problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more.\" So each maximal consecutive sequence of the same emoji in a row or column, of length 2 or longer, is counted once. So if there's a run of 5, that's one line. But if two separate runs in the same row or column, each of length >=2, then they count as two.\n\nSo my approach is: for each row, check consecutive emojis. For each run of same emoji, if the length is >=2, add 1 to the count. Similarly for each column.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"horizontal or vertical lines\". So each horizontal line (row) and vertical line (column). So for each row, process each horizontal line. For each column, process each vertical line.\n\nSo first, process all rows. For each row, go through each position, track current emoji, current run length. When the emoji changes or ends, if the run was >=2, add 1 to the count.\n\nSame for columns: for each column, check vertical runs.\n\nSo let's take the first row: 🌒🐴🐘🐏🐘🌒🌒🐏🐬🐘\n\nLooking at it, let's see the runs:\n\nPosition 0: 🌒. Then position 1 is 🐴. So run length 1 for 🌒. No count.\n\nThen 🐴 at 1, next is 🐘. Run 1. No count.\n\nThen 🐘 at 2, next is 🐏. Run 1. No.\n\nThen 🐏 at 3, next is 🐘. Run 1. No.\n\nThen 🐘 at 4, next is 🌒. Run 1. No.\n\nThen 🌒 at 5, next is 🌒 at 6. So run starts here. Let's see:\n\nPositions 5 and 6 are 🌒. So run of 2. Count 1. Then position 7 is 🐏. So that's a run of 2, so count +1.\n\nWait, but in the first row, after position 5, 6, 7? Let me list the first row:\n\nRow 0: [🌒, 🐴, 🐘, 🐏, 🐘, 🌒, 🌒, 🐏, 🐬, 🐘]\n\nLooking at the runs:\n\n- 🌒 (1) → run length 1 → no.\n- Then 🐴 (1) → no.\n- 🐘 (1) → no.\n- 🐏 (1) → no.\n- 🐘 (1) → no.\n- 🌒, 🌒 → run of 2 → count +=1. Then next is 🐏. So that's a run in row 0 of length 2.\n- Then 🐏 (1) → no.\n- 🐬 (1) → no.\n- 🐘 (1) → no.\n\nSo in the first row, there is 1 horizontal line (the two 🌒s).\n\nThen the second row: 🌒🐘🐬🌒🌒🦙🐘🐏🦆🐘\n\nRow 1: [🌒, 🐘, 🐬, 🌒, 🌒, 🦙, 🐘, 🐏, 🦆, 🐘]\n\nLooking for consecutive same:\n\n- 🌒 (1) → no.\n- 🐘 (1) → no.\n- 🐬 (1) → no.\n- 🌒, 🌒 → run of 2 → count +1. So row 1 contributes 1.\n- Then 🦙 (1) → no.\n- 🐘 (1) → no.\n- 🐏 (1) → no.\n- 🦆 (1) → no.\n- 🐘 (1) → no.\n\nSo row 1 adds 1.\n\nThird row: 🦆🐏🐬🐘🐏🐴🦆🐏🦆🐬\n\nRow 2: [🦆, 🐏, 🐬, 🐘, 🐏, 🐴, 🦆, 🐏, 🦆, 🐬]\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\nCheck each pair:\n\nPositions 0: 🦆, next is 🐏 → no.\n\n1: 🐏 next is 🐬 → no.\n\n3: 🐘 next is 🐏 → no.\n\n4: 🐏 next is 🐴 → no.\n\n6: 🦆 next is 🐏 → no.\n\n7: 🐏 next is 🦆 → no.\n\nNo runs here. So row 2 has 0 horizontal lines.\n\nFourth row: 🐬🐘🌿🌿🌒🐴🐬🌒🐏🐘\n\nRow 3: [🐬, 🐘, 🌿, 🌿, 🌒, 🐴, 🐬, 🌒, 🐏, 🐘]\n\nCheck for runs:\n\nAt positions 2 and 3: 🌿🌿 → run of 2 → count +=1. So row 3 has 1.\n\nFifth row: 🐬🐏🐏🌿🌿🦙🐬🌿🌒🐴\n\nRow 4: [🐬, 🐏, 🐏, 🌿, 🌿, 🦙, 🐬, 🌿, 🌒, 🐴]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nPosition 1-2: 🐏🐏 → 2 → count +=1.\n\nPositions 3-4: 🌿🌿 → count +=1.\n\nSo row 4 has two horizontal lines.\n\nRow 5: 🦙🦙🦆🌒🐏🐏🐏🦆🌒🦆\n\nRow 5: [🦙, 🦙, 🦆, 🌒, 🐏, 🐏, 🐏, 🦆, 🌒, 🦆]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n0-1: 🦙🦙 → 2 → count +=1.\n\n4-5-6: 🐏 repeated three times. This is a run of 3, which counts as one line.\n\nSo in row 5, two horizontal lines.\n\nRow 6: 🐬🌒🐬🦆🐴🐬🌿🌒🌿🐴\n\nRow 6: [🐬, 🌒, 🐬, 🦆, 🐴, 🐬, 🌿, 🌒, 🌿, 🐴]\n\nCheck for consecutive same:\n\nLooking at each pair. No consecutive same emojis here. So row 6 has 0.\n\nRow 7: 🦆🐘🐬🐴🐬🐏🐘🐏🐘🐬\n\nRow 7: [🦆, 🐘, 🐬, 🐴, 🐬, 🐏, 🐘, 🐏, 🐘, 🐬]\n\nCheck for runs. All adjacent are different. So 0.\n\nRow 8: 🌿🌒🐬🐬🐏🦙🐘🦆🐬🐏\n\nRow 8: [🌿, 🌒, 🐬, 🐬, 🐏, 🦙, 🐘, 🦆, 🐬, 🐏]\n\nPositions 2-3: 🐬🐬 → count +=1. So row 8 has 1.\n\nRow 9: 🦙🐴🐏🦙🌿🌒🌿🐘🐬🌒\n\nRow 9: [🦙, 🐴, 🐏, 🦙, 🌿, 🌒, 🌿, 🐘, 🐬, 🌒]\n\nCheck for consecutive. All adjacent are different. So 0.\n\nSo total horizontal lines from rows: 1 (row0) +1 (row1) +0 (row2) +1 (row3) +2 (row4) +2 (row5) +0 (row6) +0 (row7) +1 (row8) +0 (row9) → sum is 1+1+1+2+2+1 = 8?\n\nWait, let's recalculate:\n\nRow 0: 1\n\nRow 1: 1 → total 2.\n\nRow 3:1 → total 3.\n\nRow4: 2 → total 5.\n\nRow5: 2 → total 7.\n\nRow8:1 → total 8.\n\nSo horizontal lines sum to 8.\n\nNow vertical lines.\n\nNeed to check each column. For each column, check each cell and see if consecutive cells down the column have the same emoji.\n\nLet's go column by column.\n\nColumn 0: rows 0-9, first element.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow0: 🌒\n\nRow1: 🌒\n\nRow2: 🦆\n\nRow3: 🐬\n\nRow4: 🐬\n\nRow5: 🦙\n\nRow6: 🐬\n\nRow7: 🦆\n\nRow8: 🌿\n\nRow9: 🦙\n\nSo looking for consecutive same in column 0:\n\nRow0 and row1: 🌒 and 🌒 → run of 2 → count +=1.\n\nThen row1 to row2: 🌒 to 🦆 → break.\n\nRow2 is 🦆, row3 is 🐬 → no.\n\nRow3: 🐬, row4: 🐬 → run of 2 → count +=1.\n\nRow4 to row5: 🐬 to 🦙 → break.\n\nRow5 is 🦙, row6 is 🐬 → no.\n\nRow6 is 🐬, row7 is 🦆 → no.\n\nRow7: 🦆, row8: 🌿 → no.\n\nRow8: 🌿, row9: 🦙 → no.\n\nSo column 0 has two vertical lines (the first two runs: 🌒🌒 and 🐬🐬).\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow0: 🐴\n\nRow1: 🐘\n\nRow2: 🐏\n\nRow3: 🐘\n\nRow4: 🐏\n\nRow5: 🦙\n\nRow6: 🌒\n\nRow7: 🐘\n\nRow8: 🌒\n\nRow9: 🐴\n\nCheck consecutive same:\n\nRow0 (🐴) vs row1 (🐘) → no.\n\nRow1 (🐘) vs row2 (🐏) → no.\n\nRow2 (🐏) vs row3 (🐘) → no.\n\nRow3 (🐘) vs row4 (🐏) → no.\n\nRow4 (🐏) vs row5 (🦙) → no.\n\nRow5 (🦙) vs row6 (🌒) → no.\n\nRow6 (🌒) vs row7 (🐘) → no.\n\nRow7 (🐘) vs row8 (🌒) → no.\n\nRow8 (🌒) vs row9 (🐴) → no.\n\nNo vertical lines in column1.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow0: 🐘\n\nRow1: 🐬\n\nRow2: 🐬\n\nRow3: 🌿\n\nRow4: 🐏\n\nRow5: 🦆\n\nRow6: 🐬\n\nRow7: 🐬\n\nRow8: 🐬\n\nRow9: 🐏\n\nLooking for consecutive same.\n\nRow0: 🐘 → next row1: 🐬 → no.\n\nRow1: 🐬 and row2: 🐬 → run of 2 → count +=1.\n\nThen row2 (🐬) vs row3 (🌿) → break.\n\nRow3: 🌿 vs row4 (🐏) → no.\n\nRow4 (🐏) vs row5 (🦆) → no.\n\nRow5 (🦆) vs row6 (🐬) → no.\n\nRow6 (🐬) vs row7 (🐬) → run of 2 → count +=1.\n\nRow7 (🐬) vs row8 (🐬) → run continues. So run from row6 to row8 is row6,7,8 → three same. So this is a run of 3, which counts as 1. So in the column2, between rows1-2 is a run of 2, and rows6-8 is a run of 3. So total two vertical lines in column2.\n\nWait, let's step through:\n\nStart from row0:\n\nRow0: 🐘 (col2).\n\nRow1: 🐬 (col2). Different. So no.\n\nRow1: 🐬, row2: 🐬 → same. So run starts here. So run length 2. Count +=1.\n\nRow3: 🌿 → different. So run ends.\n\nThen row4: 🐏 → different.\n\nRow5: 🦆 → different.\n\nRow6: 🐬, row7: 🐬 → same. Run starts here. Then row7 and row8: 🐬 → same. So this is a run of 3 (rows6-8). So this is a single vertical line. So column2 has two vertical lines.\n\nSo column2 count is 2.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🐏\n\nRow1: 🌒\n\nRow2: 🐘\n\nRow3: 🌿\n\nRow4: 🌿\n\nRow5: 🌒\n\nRow6: 🦆\n\nRow7: 🐴\n\nRow8: 🐬\n\nRow9: 🦙\n\nCheck consecutive same:\n\nRow3: 🌿 and row4: 🌿 → same.

Wait row3 in column5 is 🐴? Let's check:\n\nWait column5 for each row:\n\nRow0's fifth element is 🐘 (since the first row is [🌒, 🐴, 🐘, 🐏, 🐘, 🌒, 🌒, 🐏, 🐬, 🐘]. Wait wait, column numbers may be confusing. Wait the columns are 0-9. So each row has 10 elements, index 0 to 9.\n\nWait for column5:\n\nRow0: the fifth element is 🐘 (since indices are 0-based). Let's recheck:\n\nOriginal input:\n\nFirst row: 🌒🐴🐘🐏🐘🌒🌒🐏🐬🐘\n\nWhich is 0: 🌒, 1: 🐴, 2: 🐘, 3: 🐏, 4: 🐘, 5: 🌒, 6: 🌒, 7: 🐏, 8: 🐬, 9: 🐘.\n\nSo column5 for row0 is 🌒 (index5).\n\nThen column5 for row1:\n\nRow1: 🌒🐘🐬🌒🌒🦙🐘🐏🦆🐘 → index5 is 🦙.\n\nRow2: 🦆🐏🐬🐘🐏🐴🦆🐏🦆🐬 → index5 is 🐴.\n\nRow3: 🐬🐘🌿🌿🌒🐴🐬🌒🐏🐘 → index5 is 🐴.\n\nRow4: 🐬🐏🐏🌿🌿🦙🐬🌿🌒🐴 → index5 is 🦙.\n\nRow5: 🦙🦙🦆🌒🐏🐏🐏🦆🌒🦆 → index5 is 🐏.\n\nRow6: 🐬🌒🐬🦆🐴🐬🌿🌒🌿🐴 → index5 is 🐬.\n\nRow7: 🦆🐘🐬🐴🐬🐏🐘🐏🐘🐬 → index5 is 🐏.\n\nRow8: 🌿🌒🐬🐬🐏🦙🐘🦆🐬🐏 → index5 is 🦙.\n\nRow9: 🦙🐴🐏🦙🌿🌒🌿🐘🐬🌒 → index5 is 🌒.\n\nWait, column5 for each row:\n\nRow0:5 → 🌒\n\nRow1:5 → 🦙\n\nRow2:5 → 🐴\n\nRow3:5 → 🐴\n\nRow4:5 → 🦙\n\nRow5:5 → 🐏\n\nRow6:5 → 🐬\n\nRow7:5 → 🐏\n\nRow8:5 → 🦙\n\nRow9:5 → 🌒\n\nLooking for consecutive same in column5:\n\nRow0 (🌒) and row1 (🦙) → no.\n\nRow1 (🦙) and row2 (🐴) → no.\n\nRow2 (🐴) and row3 (🐴) → same, run of 2 → count +=1.\n\nRow3 (🐴) and row4 (🦙) → no.\n\nRow4 (🦙) and row5 (🐏) → no.\n\nRow5 (🐏) and row6 (🐬) → no.\n\nRow6 (🐬) and row7 (🐏) → no.\n\nRow7 (🐏) and row8 (🦙) → no.\n\nRow8 (🦙) and row9 (🌒) → no.\n\nSo column5 has one vertical line.\n\nColumn6:\n\nCheck each row's sixth element (index6):\n\nRow0:6 → 🌒\n\nRow1:6 → 🐘\n\nRow2:6 → 🦆\n\nRow3:6 → 🐬\n\nRow4:6 → 🐬\n\nRow5:6 → 🐏\n\nRow6:6 → 🌿\n\nRow7:6 → 🐘\n\nRow8:6 → 🐘\n\nRow9:6 → 🌿\n\nCheck consecutive same in column6:\n\nRow0 (🌒) → row1 (🐘) → no.\n\nRow1 (🐘) → row2 (🦆) → no.\n\nRow2 (🦆) → row3 (🐬) → no.\n\nRow3 (🐬) → row4 (🐬) → same → run of 2 → count +=1.\n\nRow4 (🐬) → row5 (🐏) → no.\n\nRow5 (🐏) → row6 (🌿) → no.\n\nRow6 (🌿) → row7 (🐘) → no.\n\nRow7 (🐘) → row8 (🐘) → same → run of 2 → count +=1.\n\nRow8 (🐘) → row9 (🌿) → no.\n\nSo column6 has two vertical lines.\n\nColumn7:\n\nCheck index7 of each row.\n\nRow0:7 → 🐏\n\nRow1:7 → 🐏\n\nRow2:7 → 🐏\n\nRow3:7 → 🌒\n\nRow4:7 → 🌿\n\nRow5:7 → 🦆\n\nRow6:7 → 🌒\n\nRow7:7 → 🐏\n\nRow8:7 → 🦆\n\nRow9:7 → 🐘\n\nLooking for same consecutive.\n\nRow0 (🐏), row1 (🐏), row2 (🐏): same for three in a row → run of 3 → count +=1.\n\nWait:\n\nRow0:7 is 🐏.\n\nRow1:7 is 🐏 → same as row0.

So that's two lines in row5.\n\nSo row5 contributes 2.\n\nRow4: two runs (🐏🐏 and 🌿🌿) → two lines.\n\nSo yes, horizontal lines total 8.\n\nSo total answer is 8 +13=21.\n\nWait but wait, row5's horizontal line:\n\nRow5 is 🦙🦙🦆🌒🐏🐏🐏🦆🌒🦆.\n\nThe first two 🦙s → run of 2, then the three 🐏s (positions4-6).

I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines of the same emoji with length 2 or more on this board. Hmm. The lines can be horizontal (same row) or vertical (same column), right? And each line has to consist of the same emoji. Also, the line's length must be 2 or more. Oh, but wait, overlapping lines might count multiple times. Like, a sequence of 3 same emojis in a row would count as two lines (positions 1-2 and 2-3) or is it considered as a single line of length 3? Wait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So perhaps each maximal line (as long as possible) is counted once. For example, a sequence of 4 same emojis in a row would contribute 1 line, not three. Because if you count every possible sub-sequence of 2 or longer, then a sequence of 3 would have 2 (length 2 and 3), but maybe the problem counts each maximal consecutive sequence. So the question is, does the problem want every possible contiguous sequence of 2+ length, or each maximal sequence (longest possible) once?\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. For example, in a row like 🥰🥰🥰, how many lines are there? If each run of same emojis is considered. So in this case, a single run of 3, so counts as 1 line. Because the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji\", which probably refers to consecutive same emojis. So for a horizontal line, consecutive same emojis in a row. Similarly for vertical. So each run of consecutive same emojis in a row (horizontal) or column (vertical) of length >=2 contributes 1 to the count.\n\nSo the approach is: for each row, check all horizontal runs, then for each column, check all vertical runs. Each run of >=2 same emojis counts as one line.\n\nSo the total number is the sum of all horizontal runs (per row) and vertical runs (per column) that have length >=2.\n\nAlright. Let's look at the given board.\n\nThe board has 10 rows and 10 columns. So each row is 10 emojis, and there are 10 columns.\n\nFor each row, I need to check the runs. For example, take the first row: 🥰🦍🐨🌰😀🐨🐭🌰💦🌰.\n\nLet's look at each element and group consecutive same ones. Let's see:\n\nRow 1:\n\n1. 🥰 → starts a new run.\n2. 🦍 → different, so the first run is of length 1. Doesn't count. New run starts.\n3. 🐨 → different, run length 1. New run.\n4. 🌰 → run length 1.\n5. 😀 → run 1.\n6. 🐨 → different. New run.\n7. 🐭 → run 1.\n8. 🌰 → run 1.\n9. 💦 → run 1.\n10. 🌰 → run 1.\n\nSo in this row, all runs are of length 1. So no horizontal lines here.\n\nWait, no. Wait, first element is 🥰, then next is different. So run length 1. So no contribution from row 1.\n\nNext row: row 2: 😀🌰🦍🌰🥰🐭💦🦍🐨🥰.\n\nCheck each consecutive pair:\n\nStart with 😀. Next is 🌰 (different). So run 1. Then 🌰 and 🦍: different. So run 1. Then 🦍 and 🌰: different. So each run is 1. Then 🌰 and 🥰: different. Then 🥰 and 🐭: different. Next 🐭 and 💦: different. Then 💦 and 🦍: different. Then 🦍 and 🐨: different. Then 🐨 and 🥰: different. So all runs are 1. So row 2 has no horizontal lines.\n\nHmm. Let's look at row 7: 🥰🥰🥰🐭💦🐨🐨🐨🐖🐨.\n\nBreaking this down:\n\nStarts with three 🥰. So that's a run of 3. So that's one horizontal line. Then 🐭 (length 1). Then 💦 (1). Then three 🐨 (run of 3 → another line). Then 🐖 (1). Then 🐨 (1). So in row 7, there are two runs of >=2: the three 🥰 (counts as 1), three 🐨 (counts as 1). So row 7 contributes 2 horizontal lines.\n\nSimilarly, column processing: for each column, check vertical runs. For example, column 1:\n\nRow 1: 🥰.\n\nRow 2: 😀.\n\nRow 3: 💦.\n\nRow 4: 🦍.\n\nRow 5: 🐨.\n\nRow 6: 😀.\n\nRow 7: 🥰.\n\nRow 8: 🐖.\n\nRow 9: 🥰.\n\nRow10: 🐭.\n\nAll different. So no vertical lines here.\n\nBut for other columns, perhaps there are runs.\n\nLet's look at column 7 in each row. Let's see:\n\nRow 1 column 7: 🐭.\n\nRow 2: 🦍.\n\nRow 3: 🥰.\n\nRow4: 🐨.\n\nRow5: 🦍.\n\nRow6: 🐭.\n\nRow7: 🐨.\n\nRow8: 🐭.\n\nRow9: 💦.\n\nRow10: 🐨.\n\nSo all different. No run here.\n\nAlternatively, let's check column 3:\n\nRow1: 🐨.\n\nRow2: 🦍.\n\nRow3: 🥰.\n\nRow4: 🐨.\n\nRow5: 🥰.\n\nRow6: 🥰.\n\nRow7: 🥰.\n\nRow8: 🐖.\n\nRow9: 😀.\n\nRow10: 🦍.\n\nSo row5,6,7 in column3: 🥰, 🥰, 🥰. Wait, column3's rows:\n\nWait column3 is the third position in each row.\n\nRow1: 3rd emoji is 🐨.\n\nRow2: 3rd is 🦍.\n\nRow3: 3rd is 🥰.\n\nRow4: 3rd is 🐨.\n\nRow5: 3rd is 🥰.\n\nRow6: 3rd is 🥰.\n\nRow7: 3rd is 🥰.\n\nRow8: 3rd is 🐖.\n\nRow9: 3rd is 😀.\n\nRow10: 3rd is 💦.\n\nWait, maybe I got the rows wrong. Let me recount.\n\nWait the board is 10 rows. Each row is a line of 10 emojis. So for example, row 7 is:\n\n🥰🥰🥰🐭💦🐨🐨🐨🐖🐨.\n\nSo the third emoji in row7 is 🥰.\n\nSo for column3 (third position in each row):\n\nRow1: 🐨.\n\nRow2: 🦍.\n\nRow3: 🥰.\n\nRow4: 🐨.\n\nRow5: 🥰.\n\nRow6: 🥰.\n\nRow7: 🥰.\n\nRow8: 🐖.\n\nRow9: 😀.\n\nRow10: 🐨.\n\nSo from row5 to row7 in column3: 🥰, 🥰, 🥰. So a vertical run of 3. So that's a vertical line. So that's one contribution.\n\nWait, but how does column processing work? For each column, you check consecutive same emojis. So for column3, let's process each emoji and group consecutive.\n\nRow1: 🐨 → start.\n\nRow2: 🦍 → different. So first run is 1. New run: 🦍 (row2).\n\nRow3: 🥰 → different. Second run ends (length 1). New run: 🥰 (row3).\n\nRow4: 🐨 → different. Run length 1. New run: 🐨 (row4).\n\nRow5: 🥰 → different. Run length 1. New run: 🥰 (row5).\n\nRow6: 🥰 → same as row5. Run continues. Now row6 is same as row5. So run is 2. Then row7: same as row6. So run becomes 3. So this is a vertical run of 3. So counts as 1 vertical line.\n\nRow8: 🐖 → different. So the run from row5-7 is 3, which counts as 1 line. Then new runs start.\n\nSo in column3, there is 1 vertical line (rows5-7). So that's one.\n\nBut how many vertical lines are there in each column?\n\nThis will take time. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, process each row for horizontal lines.\n\nRow1: 🥰🦍🐨🌰😀🐨🐭🌰💦🌰 → all runs are 1. 0 lines.\n\nRow2: 😀🌰🦍🌰🥰🐭💦🦍🐨🥰 → same. All runs 1. 0 lines.\n\nRow3: 💦😀🥰🐖🌰💦🥰🦍🌰😀 → check:\n\nConsecutive:\n\n1. 💦 (1) → next is 😀 → different. Run ends (1).\n2. 😀 (1) → next 🥰 → different. Run ends.\n3. 🥰 (1) → next 🐖 → different.\n4. 🐖 (1) → next 🌰 → different.\n5. 🌰 (1) → next 💦 → different.\n6. 💦 (1) → next 🥰 → different.\n7. 🥰 (1) → next 🦍 → different.\n8. 🦍 (1) → next 🌰 → different.\n9. 🌰 (1) → next 😀 → different.\nNo runs of >=2. So 0.\n\nRow4: 🦍💦🐨🐖🦍💦🐨💦🐭🦍 → check each run.\n\n1. 🦍 (1) → next 💦 → different.\n2. 💦 (1) → next 🐨 → different.\n3. 🐨 (1) → next 🐖 → different.\n4. 🐖 (1) → next 🦍 → different.\n5. 🦍 (1) → next 💦 → different.\n6. 💦 (1) → next 🐨 → different.\n7. 🐨 (1) → next 💦 → different.\n8. 💦 (1) → next 🐭 → different.\n9. 🐭 (1) → next 🦍 → different.\nAll runs 1. 0 lines.\n\nRow5: 🐨🦍🥰🥰🐭🦍😀🌰🐖🌰 → check runs.\n\nElements: 🐨, 🦍, 🥰, 🥰, 🐭, 🦍, 😀, 🌰, 🐖, 🌰.\n\nConsecutive:\n\n- 🐨 (1) → different next.\n- 🦍 (1) → next 🥰.\n- 🥰, 🥰 → run of 2. So count 1 here. Then next is 🐭. So this run contributes 1.\n\nOther runs: 🐭 (1), 🦍 (1), 😀 (1), 🌰 (1), 🐖 (1), 🌰 (1). So row5 has 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow6: 😀💦🥰🐨🐭🐭💦🦍🦍😀 → check runs.\n\nElements: 😀, 💦, 🥰, 🐨, 🐭, 🐭, 💦, 🦍, 🦍, 😀.\n\nConsecutive:\n\n😀 (1) → next 💦.\n\n💦 (1) → next 🥰.\n\n🥰 (1) → next 🐨.\n\n🐨 (1) → next 🐭.\n\n🐭, 🐭 → run of 2 → count 1. Next is 💦.\n\nThen 💦 (1) → next 🦍.\n\n🦍, 🦍 → run of 2 → count 1. Next is 😀.\n\nSo in row6, two runs of 2. So contributes 2 horizontal lines.\n\nRow7: 🥰🥰🥰🐭💦🐨🐨🐨🐖🐨 → as discussed earlier. Runs:\n\n🥰 x3 → run of 3 → count 1.\n\n🐭 (1).\n\n💦 (1).\n\n🐨 x3 → run of 3 → count 1.\n\n🐖 (1).\n\n🐨 (1).\n\nSo total 2 lines here.\n\nRow8: 🐖🐨🐖💦🐭🌰🐭🐨🌰🌰 → check runs.\n\nElements: 🐖, 🐨, 🐖, 💦, 🐭, 🌰, 🐭, 🐨, 🌰, 🌰.\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\n🐖 → next 🐨 → different.\n\n🐨 → next 🐖 → different.\n\n🐖 → next 💦 → different.\n\n💦 → next 🐭 → different.\n\n🐭 → next 🌰 → different.\n\n🌰 → next 🐭 → different.\n\n🐭 → next 🐨 → different.\n\n🐨 → next 🌰 → different.\n\n🌰, 🌰 → run of 2 → count 1.\n\nSo row8 has 1 line.\n\nRow9: 🥰🐨😀🦍🥰🐨💦🌰🐭🥰 → all runs are 1. So 0 lines.\n\nRow10: 🐭🥰💦🐨🐨💦🐖🥰🌰🐭 → check.\n\nElements: 🐭, 🥰, 💦, 🐨, 🐨, 💦, 🐖, 🥰, 🌰, 🐭.\n\nConsecutive:\n\n🐭 (1) → next 🥰.\n\n🥰 (1) → next 💦.\n\n💦 (1) → next 🐨.\n\n🐨, 🐨 → run of 2 → count 1. Next is 💦.\n\n💦 (1) → next 🐖.\n\n🐖 (1) → next 🥰.\n\n🥰 (1) → next 🌰.\n\n🌰 (1) → next 🐭.\n\nSo row10 has 1 horizontal line.\n\nSo total horizontal lines:\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:2\n\nRow7:2\n\nRow8:1\n\nRow10:1\n\nSo sum: 1+2+2+1+1=7 horizontal lines.\n\nNow for vertical lines. Need to check each column.\n\nThere are 10 columns. Let's process each column one by one.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nEmojis (rows 1-10):\n\nRow1: 🥰\n\nRow2: 😀\n\nRow3: 💦\n\nRow4: 🦍\n\nRow5: 🐨\n\nRow6: 😀\n\nRow7: 🥰\n\nRow8: 🐖\n\nRow9: 🥰\n\nRow10: 🐭\n\nAll different. No runs. 0.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow1: 🦍\n\nRow2: 🌰\n\nRow3: 😀\n\nRow4: 💦\n\nRow5: 🦍\n\nRow6: 💦\n\nRow7: 🥰\n\nRow8: 🐨\n\nRow9: 🐨\n\nRow10: 🥰\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\nRow1: 🦍 (1)\n\nRow2: 🌰 → different.

I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more. The board is given as 6 rows, each with 6 emojis. So first, I'll try to visualize the board.\n\nThe board is a 6x6 grid. Let me write out each row to make it easier.\n\nRow 1: ☀️, ❄️, 🪐, ☀️, 🪐, ❄️\nRow 2: 🪐, 🪐, 🪐, 🐮, ☀️, ☀️\nRow 3: 🪐, ☀️, ❄️, ❄️, 🪐, ❄️\nRow 4: ☀️, 🐮, 🪐, ☀️, ☀️, ☀️\nRow 5: ❄️, ☀️, 🐮, ☀️, ❄️, ❄️\nRow 6: 🐮, ☀️, ☀️, 🐮, ❄️, 🐮\n\nNow, I need to check each row for horizontal lines and each column for vertical lines. A line is a sequence of the same emoji, and each line of length 2 or more counts. But wait, if a longer line exists, like length 3, does that count as multiple lines? For example, a line of 3 would have 2 lines of length 2 (overlapping). The problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". So I think each possible consecutive sequence of 2 or more in a row or column. But maybe the problem counts each maximal line once. Like, a line of length 3 is considered as one line (since it's a single line of 3), not two separate lines. Because otherwise, a line of n length would contribute (n-1) lines of 2. But the problem statement isn't clear. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe question says, \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more. Output the total count of such lines as the answer.\" So I think a line is a contiguous sequence of the same emoji in a row (horizontal) or column (vertical), and each such line that is at least 2 in length counts as 1. So for example, a sequence of 3 same emojis in a row would be considered one line. But if there's a longer line, like 4, that's one line. So I don't need to break it into shorter segments. Because the problem says \"lines\" in the sense of the maximal consecutive sequence.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem counts all possible consecutive pairs. For example, in a horizontal line of 3, there are two overlapping pairs (positions 1-2 and 2-3). So each possible consecutive run of 2 or more. But the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So each run of 2, 3, etc., counts as a single line. So a run of 3 in a row would count as one line. So how to count?\n\nHmm. The problem is a bit ambiguous, but perhaps the intended approach is that each maximal consecutive sequence (i.e., not overlapping) of two or more counts as one line. So for example, in a row like 🪐🪐🪐, that's one line of length 3. So it would count as 1. If a row has two separate sequences, like 🪐🪐☀️🪐🪐, then two lines (each of length 2). So the approach should be to check each row and column for maximal consecutive sequences of same emojis with length >=2, and sum all of them.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each row, scan left to right, find all horizontal lines (maximal sequences of same emoji, length >=2). Count each such line as 1.\n\n2. For each column, scan top to bottom, find all vertical lines (same as above). Count each such line as 1.\n\nTotal count is sum of horizontal and vertical lines.\n\nSo the first step is to process each row.\n\nLet's start with the horizontal lines.\n\nRow 1: ☀️, ❄️, 🪐, ☀️, 🪐, ❄️\n\nLooking for consecutive same emojis:\n\nPositions 0: ☀️. Next is ❄️ → different. So no line here.\n\nPosition 1: ❄️. Next is 🪐 → different. No line.\n\nPosition 2: 🪐 → next is ☀️. Different. No line.\n\nPosition 3: ☀️ → next is 🪐. Different.\n\nPosition 4: 🪐 → next is ❄️. Different.\n\nSo no horizontal lines in row 1. So count 0.\n\nRow 2: 🪐, 🪐, 🪐, 🐮, ☀️, ☀️\n\nLooking at the first three 🪐, then 🐮, then two ☀️.\n\nSo sequences:\n\nFirst three 🪐: a horizontal line of length 3 → count 1.\n\nThen two ☀️: a horizontal line of length 2 → count 1.\n\nSo row 2 contributes 2 horizontal lines.\n\nRow 3: 🪐, ☀️, ❄️, ❄️, 🪐, ❄️\n\nLooking for sequences:\n\nPositions 2 and 3: ❄️❄️ → length 2 → count 1.\n\nSo row 3 has 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow 4: ☀️, 🐮, 🪐, ☀️, ☀️, ☀️\n\nAt positions 3,4,5: three ☀️. So length 3 → count 1.\n\nRow 4 contributes 1.\n\nRow 5: ❄️, ☀️, 🐮, ☀️, ❄️, ❄️\n\nAt positions 4 and 5: ❄️❄️ → length 2. So count 1.\n\nRow 5: 1.\n\nRow 6: 🐮, ☀️, ☀️, 🐮, ❄️, 🐮\n\nAt positions 1 and 2: two ☀️. So count 1.\n\nSo row 6 contributes 1.\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 0 (row1) + 2 (row2) +1 (row3) +1 (row4) +1 (row5) +1 (row6) → 6 horizontal lines.\n\nNow vertical lines. Each column needs to be checked for consecutive same emojis. Let's process each column (columns 0 to 5), each of 6 rows.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow1: ☀️\n\nRow2: 🪐\n\nRow3: 🪐\n\nRow4: ☀️\n\nRow5: ❄️\n\nRow6: 🐮\n\nSo the column entries are: ☀️, 🪐, 🪐, ☀️, ❄️, 🐮.\n\nCheck for sequences:\n\nRow2 and 3: 🪐🪐 → length 2. So count 1.\n\nSo column 0: 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow1: ❄️\n\nRow2: 🪐\n\nRow3: ☀️\n\nRow4: 🐮\n\nRow5: ☀️\n\nRow6: ☀️\n\nEntries: ❄️, 🪐, ☀️, 🐮, ☀️, ☀️.\n\nCheck for sequences:\n\nRow5 and 6: ☀️☀️ → length 2. Count 1.\n\nSo column 1: 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow1: 🪐\n\nRow2: 🪐\n\nRow3: ❄️\n\nRow4: 🪐\n\nRow5: 🐮\n\nRow6: ☀️\n\nEntries: 🪐, 🪐, ❄️, 🪐, 🐮, ☀️.\n\nSequences:\n\nRow1 and 2: 🪐🪐 → length 2. Count 1.\n\nSo column 2: 1.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow1: ☀️\n\nRow2: 🐮\n\nRow3: ❄️\n\nRow4: ☀️\n\nRow5: ☀️\n\nRow6: 🐮.\n\nEntries: ☀️, 🐮, ❄️, ☀️, ☀️, 🐮.\n\nCheck sequences:\n\nRow4 and 5: ☀️☀️ → length 2. Count 1.\n\nSo column3: 1.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow1: 🪐\n\nRow2: ☀️\n\nRow3: 🪐\n\nRow4: ☀️\n\nRow5: ❄️\n\nRow6: ❄️.\n\nEntries: 🪐, ☀️, 🪐, ☀️, ❄️, ❄️.\n\nSequences:\n\nRow5 and 6: ❄️❄️ → length 2. Count 1.\n\nSo column4: 1.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow1: ❄️\n\nRow2: ☀️\n\nRow3: ❄️\n\nRow4: ☀️\n\nRow5: ❄️\n\nRow6: 🐮.\n\nEntries: ❄️, ☀️, ❄️, ☀️, ❄️, 🐮.\n\nCheck sequences:\n\nLooking for consecutive same in column:\n\nRow1: ❄️, row2: ☀️ → different.\n\nRow2: ☀️, row3: ❄️ → different.\n\nRow3: ❄️, row4: ☀️ → different.\n\nRow4: ☀️, row5: ❄️ → different.\n\nRow5: ❄️, row6: 🐮 → different. So no sequences in column5. So count 0.\n\nSo vertical lines sum: 1 (col0) +1 (col1) +1 (col2) +1 (col3) +1 (col4) +0 (col5) → total 5 vertical lines.\n\nWait, let me recheck each column again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet's re-verify column 0:\n\nRow1: ☀️ (0), row2: 🪐 (1), row3: 🪐 (2), row4: ☀️ (3), row5: ❄️ (4), row6: 🐮 (5).\n\nSequences:\n\nRow1: ☀️. Next is row2: 🪐 → different. No.\n\nRow2: 🪐. Next row3: 🪐 → same. So that's a sequence of 2 → count 1.\n\nRow3: 🪐. Next row4: ☀️ → different.\n\nRow4: ☀️. Next row5: ❄️ → different.\n\nRow5: ❄️. Next row6: 🐮 → different. So only one sequence in column0: row2-3.\n\nSo correct.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow1: ❄️, row2: 🪐 → different.\n\nRow2: 🪐, row3: ☀️ → different.\n\nRow3: ☀️, row4: 🐮 → different.\n\nRow4: 🐮, row5: ☀️ → different.\n\nRow5: ☀️, row6: ☀️ → same. So sequence of 2 (rows5-6). So yes, count 1.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow1: 🪐, row2: 🪐 → same. So sequence of 2. Count 1.\n\nRow3: ❄️, next is row4: 🪐 → different.\n\nSo column2 has 1.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow1: ☀️, row2: 🐮 → different.\n\nRow2: 🐮, row3: ❄️ → different.\n\nRow3: ❄️, row4: ☀️ → different.\n\nRow4: ☀️, row5: ☀️ → same. So sequence of 2. Wait, row4 is in position3 (row4), row5 is position4 (row5). So in column3:\n\nRow4 (position3) is ☀️, row5 (position4) is ☀️. So that's two in a row. So sequence of 2. So count 1.\n\nSo column3 is 1.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow1: 🪐, row2: ☀️ → different.\n\nRow2: ☀️, row3: 🪐 → different.\n\nRow3: 🪐, row4: ☀️ → different.\n\nRow4: ☀️, row5: ❄️ → different.\n\nRow5: ❄️, row6: ❄️ → same. So sequence of 2. Count 1.\n\nColumn5:\n\nCheck again:\n\nRow1: ❄️, row2: ☀️ → different.\n\nRow2: ☀️, row3: ❄️ → different.\n\nRow3: ❄️, row4: ☀️ → different.\n\nRow4: ☀️, row5: ❄️ → different.\n\nRow5: ❄️, row6: 🐮 → different. So no sequences. So vertical lines total 5.\n\nSo horizontal lines total 6, vertical lines 5. Total 11.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let's recount:\n\nHorizontal lines per row:\n\nRow1: 0\n\nRow2: 2 (three 🪐 and two ☀️)\n\nRow3: 1 (two ❄️)\n\nRow4: 1 (three ☀️)\n\nRow5: 1 (two ❄️)\n\nRow6: 1 (two ☀️)\n\nTotal horizontal: 0+2+1+1+1+1=6.\n\nVertical lines:\n\nColumns 0:1, 1:1, 2:1,3:1,4:1,5:0. Total 1+1+1+1+1=5.\n\nSo total is 6+5=11.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in counting vertical lines. Let's check column3 again.\n\nColumn3 entries:\n\nRow1: ☀️\n\nRow2: 🐮\n\nRow3: ❄️\n\nRow4: ☀️\n\nRow5: ☀️\n\nRow6: 🐮\n\nSo the sequence is: ☀️, 🐮, ❄️, ☀️, ☀️, 🐮.\n\nLooking for consecutive same in column3.\n\nBetween row4 and row5: ☀️ and ☀️ → same. So a sequence of two. So yes, that's one vertical line in column3.\n\nSo column3:1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo total vertical lines are 5. So 6+5=11.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed some vertical sequences. Let's check each column again.\n\nAnother example: column4.\n\nColumn4 entries:\n\nRow1: 🪐\n\nRow2: ☀️\n\nRow3: 🪐\n\nRow4: ☀️\n\nRow5: ❄️\n\nRow6: ❄️\n\nSo rows5 and 6: ❄️ and ❄️. So sequence of 2. So yes, that's counted.\n\nAnother check: column5.\n\nNo sequences. Correct.\n\nSo vertical lines:5.\n\nSo total answer is 11.\n\nBut wait, let me check all the columns again.\n\nColumn 0: rows 2-3 (🪐 and 🪐) → 1.\n\nColumn1: rows5-6 (☀️ and ☀️) →1.\n\nColumn2: rows1-2 (🪐 and 🪐) →1.\n\nColumn3: rows4-5 (☀️ and ☀️) →1.\n\nColumn4: rows5-6 (❄️ and ❄️) →1.\n\nColumn5: no.\n\nYes, that's 5.\n\nNow the horizontal lines:\n\nRow2: two sequences (three 🪐 and two ☀️) → count 2.\n\nRow3: one sequence (two ❄️) → count 1.\n\nRow4: one sequence (three ☀️) →1.\n\nRow5: one sequence (two ❄️) →1.\n\nRow6: one sequence (two ☀️) →1.\n\nRow2's two sequences are correct. Because the first three are 🪐 (count as 1), then 🐮, then two ☀️ (count as another 1). So yes.\n\nSo horizontal lines total 6.\n\nSo 6+5=11.\n\nHmm. But the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So each line is a consecutive sequence. So for example, a vertical line of two same emojis counts as one line. So the answer is 11?\n\nWait, but perhaps I missed some other lines. Let's recheck the rows.\n\nRow2: 🪐🪐🪐🐮☀️☀️.\n\nThe first three are three 🪐 in a row. So that's length 3 → counts as one line.\n\nThen the two ☀️ → another line. So row2 contributes 2.\n\nRow3: 🪐☀️❄️❄️🪐❄️.\n\nThe two ❄️ in positions 2 and 3 (third and fourth elements). So count 1.\n\nRow4: ☀️🐮🪐☀️☀️☀️.\n\nThe three ☀️ at positions 3-5 (fourth, fifth, sixth). So count 1.\n\nRow5: ❄️☀️🐮☀️❄️❄️.\n\nThe two ❄️ at positions4-5 (fifth and sixth). Count 1.\n\nRow6: 🐮☀️☀️🐮❄️🐮.\n\nThe two ☀️ at positions1-2. Count 1.\n\nYes, so horizontal lines 6.\n\nVertical lines:\n\nColumn0: rows2-3 (🪐, 🪐) →1.\n\nColumn1: rows5-6 (☀️, ☀️) →1.\n\nColumn2: rows1-2 (🪐, 🪐) →1.\n\nColumn3: rows4-5 (☀️, ☀️) →1.\n\nColumn4: rows5-6 (❄️, ❄️) →1.\n\nSo vertical lines 5.\n\nTotal 11. But wait, maybe I missed some vertical sequences. For example, in column3: rows4 and 5 are ☀️ and ☀️. Are there any other consecutive pairs in columns?\n\nLike in column4, rows5 and6: ❄️ and ❄️. That's one.\n\nOther columns:\n\nChecking column2 again:\n\nRows1: 🪐, row2: 🪐. So two in a row → count 1.\n\nBut after that, row3 is ❄️, so no.\n\nSo column2's count is correct.\n\nAnother possible mistake: column3's row4 and5 are ☀️ and ☀️. So that's two in a row. So count 1.\n\nBut what about row4: row4's column3 is ☀️, row5's column3 is ☀️. So yes.\n\nYes. So all vertical lines are accounted for.\n\nThus, the answer should be 6+5=11.

The lines can be horizontal (same row) or vertical (same column). Each line segment of length 2, 3, etc., counts as one line. But wait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji\" with length 2 or more. Hmm, so a line is a consecutive sequence, right? Like if in a row, there are three same emojis in a row, that would count as one line of length 3, but maybe also overlapping lines. Wait, but I think the standard way to count is that each maximal consecutive sequence. Wait, no. Let me think.\n\nWait, the problem statement says \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So, for example, a horizontal line of 3 same emojis would count as one line. Similarly, a vertical line of 2 would count as one. So each maximal consecutive same emoji in a row or column contributes to the count if its length is >=2. So I think that's the approach.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each row, check for consecutive sequences of the same emoji. For each such sequence of length >=2, count it as one line. For example, in a row like 🐵🌾🌾🌾🐓, the three 🌾s count as one line. Another example: if a row has AAABBB, then there's two lines: AAA and BBB.\n\n2. For each column, do the same: check consecutive sequences vertically. So same as rows, but going down each column.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Iterate through each row, scan each row to find consecutive runs of same emoji, count each run of length >=2 as 1.\n\n- Do the same for each column.\n\n- Sum the counts from rows and columns.\n\nWait, but columns are a bit trickier. Let's think about the example.\n\nLet me take the given board and process it row by row and column by column.\n\nFirst, the board is a 10x10 grid (since there are 10 rows, each with 10 emojis). Let's index rows as 0-9 and columns as 0-9.\n\nFor each row, I need to go through each cell and check consecutive cells to the right (for horizontal lines) and consecutive cells below (for vertical lines). Wait, no. Wait, for horizontal lines in the same row, and vertical lines in the same column.\n\nWait, no. The standard approach here is:\n\nFor horizontal lines: For each row, check consecutive elements in the row. For example, in row i, columns j=0 to 9. So for each row, we look from left to right. For each position, check how many consecutive same emojis are there starting at that position.\n\nWait, but for rows, for each row, we can track the current emoji and the length of the consecutive sequence. When the emoji changes, if the current run was >=2, add 1 to the count and reset. Similarly, for the end of the row.\n\nSame for columns. For each column, go from top to bottom, check consecutive sequences.\n\nYes. So for each row:\n\nInitialize current_emoji = first element in row, current_length = 1.\n\nThen for each subsequent element in the row:\n\nIf the next element is same as current_emoji, increment current_length.\n\nElse:\n\nIf current_length >=2, add 1 to the count.\n\nReset current_emoji to the new element, current_length =1.\n\nAfter processing all elements in the row, check if the last run has current_length >=2, add to count.\n\nSame for each column.\n\nSo now, let's process each row and column.\n\nLet me start with the first row:\n\nRow 0: 🐵 (0,0), 🌾 (0,1), 🌾 (0,2), 🐓 (0,3), 🌾 (0,4), 🐓 (0,5), 🎁 (0,6), 🦚 (0,7), 🐰 (0,8), 🌱 (0,9).\n\nLooking for horizontal runs:\n\nStart at 0: 🐵. Next is 🌾 (diff). So run length 1 → no count.\n\nThen position 1: 🌾. Next is 🌾 (same). Run length 2. Then position 2's next (position3) is 🐓. So run of 2. So add 1 for row 0.\n\nThen position3: 🐓. Next is 🌾 (diff). Run length 1 → no.\n\nPosition4: 🌾. Next is 🐓 (diff). Run length 1 → no.\n\nPosition5: 🐓. Next is 🎁 → run 1. No.\n\nPosition6: 🎁 → next is 🦚. Run 1.\n\nPosition7: 🦚 → next is 🐰. Run 1.\n\nPosition8: 🐰 → next 🌱. Run 1.\n\nSo row 0 has 1 horizontal line.\n\nNow row 1: ☀️🎁🐵🦚☀️🐰🌳🦚🌾☀️\n\nPositions 0-9:\n\n0: ☀️. Next is 🎁 → run 1. No.\n\n1: 🎁 → next 🐵 → run 1.\n\n2: 🐵 → next 🦚 → run 1.\n\n3: 🦚 → next ☀️ → run 1.\n\n4: ☀️ → next 🐰 → run 1.\n\n5: 🐰 → next 🌳 → run1.\n\n6: 🌳 → next 🦚 → run1.\n\n7: 🦚 → next 🌾 → run1.\n\n8: 🌾 → next ☀️ → run1.\n\nSo row1 has no horizontal lines.\n\nRow2: ☀️🌳🐵🎁🌱🐓🌱🐵🎁🌱\n\nCheck for horizontal runs.\n\n0: ☀️. Next 🌳 → run1.\n\n1: 🌳 → next 🐵 → run1.\n\n2: 🐵 → next 🎁 → run1.\n\n3: 🎁 → next 🌱 → run1.\n\n4: 🌱 → next 🐓 → run1.\n\n5: 🐓 → next 🌱 → run1.\n\n6: 🌱 → next 🐵 → run1.\n\n7: 🐵 → next 🎁 → run1.\n\n8: 🎁 → next 🌱 → run1.\n\nSo row2: no horizontal lines.\n\nRow3: 🌱🦚🐓🐵🌾🎁🦚🎁🐓🐓\n\nLooking for horizontal runs:\n\n0: 🌱 → next 🦚 → run1.\n\n1: 🦚 → next 🐓 → run1.\n\n2: 🐓 → next 🐵 → run1.\n\n3: 🐵 → next 🌾 → run1.\n\n4: 🌾 → next 🎁 → run1.\n\n5: 🎁 → next 🦚 → run1.\n\n6: 🦚 → next 🎁 → run1.\n\n7: 🎁 → next 🐓 → run1.\n\n8: 🐓 → next 🐓 → same. So run starts at 8. Next (9) is same. Run length 2. So add 1 for row3.\n\nSo row3 has 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow4: 🐵🦚🐓🐵🌾🌱🐰☀️🐰🐓\n\nCheck horizontal runs:\n\n0: 🐵 → next 🦚 → run1.\n\n1: 🦚 → next 🐓 → run1.\n\n2: 🐓 → next 🐵 → run1.\n\n3: 🐵 → next 🌾 → run1.\n\n4: 🌾 → next 🌱 → run1.\n\n5: 🌱 → next 🐰 → run1.\n\n6: 🐰 → next ☀️ → run1.\n\n7: ☀️ → next 🐰 → run1.\n\n8: 🐰 → next 🐓 → run1.\n\nNo runs in row4.\n\nRow5: 🌳🐵🦚🐰🌾🌱🌳☀️🌾🌳\n\nCheck row5:\n\n0: 🌳 → next 🐵 → run1.\n\n1: 🐵 → next 🦚 → run1.\n\n2: 🦚 → next 🐰 → run1.\n\n3: 🐰 → next 🌾 → run1.\n\n4: 🌾 → next 🌱 → run1.\n\n5: 🌱 → next 🌳 → run1.\n\n6: 🌳 → next ☀️ → run1.\n\n7: ☀️ → next 🌾 → run1.\n\n8: 🌾 → next 🌳 → run1.\n\nNo horizontal runs.\n\nRow6: 🐰🦚🐵🎁🌱🐵🌳☀️🎁🌳\n\nCheck:\n\n0: 🐰 → next 🦚 → run1.\n\n1: 🦚 → next 🐵 → run1.\n\n2: 🐵 → next 🎁 → run1.\n\n3: 🎁 → next 🌱 → run1.\n\n4: 🌱 → next 🐵 → run1.\n\n5: 🐵 → next 🌳 → run1.\n\n6: 🌳 → next ☀️ → run1.\n\n7: ☀️ → next 🎁 → run1.\n\n8: 🎁 → next 🌳 → run1.\n\nNo runs in row6.\n\nRow7: 🐵🦚🐵☀️🐓🐰🌳🌾🐓🌳\n\nCheck:\n\n0: 🐵 → next 🦚 → run1.\n\n1: 🦚 → next 🐵 → run1.\n\n2: 🐵 → next ☀️ → run1.\n\n3: ☀️ → next 🐓 → run1.\n\n4: 🐓 → next 🐰 → run1.\n\n5: 🐰 → next 🌳 → run1.\n\n6: 🌳 → next 🌾 → run1.\n\n7: 🌾 → next 🐓 → run1.\n\n8: 🐓 → next 🌳 → run1.\n\nNo runs here.\n\nRow8: 🌱🎁☀️🐰🐓🐓🐵🦚🐵🌳\n\nCheck horizontal runs:\n\n0: 🌱 → next 🎁 → run1.\n\n1: 🎁 → next ☀️ → run1.\n\n2: ☀️ → next 🐰 → run1.\n\n3: 🐰 → next 🐓 → same? Next (4) is 🐓, so positions3-4-5.\n\nWait, position3 is 🐰, position4 is 🐓. No. Wait, row8 is:\n\nPositions 0: 🌱\n\n1: 🎁\n\n2: ☀️\n\n3: 🐰\n\n4: 🐓\n\n5: 🐓\n\n6: 🐵\n\n7: 🦚\n\n8: 🐵\n\n9: 🌳\n\nSo starting from position4 (🐓), next is position5 (🐓). So run length 2. So this is a run from 4 to 5 (inclusive). Then after that, next is 🐵 (position6). So add 1 for row8's run here.\n\nSo row8 has 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow9: ☀️🐓🐰🦚🌳🌱☀️☀️🌱☀️\n\nCheck:\n\nLooking at the elements:\n\n0: ☀️ → next 🐓 → run1.\n\n1: 🐓 → next 🐰 → run1.\n\n2: 🐰 → next 🦚 → run1.\n\n3: 🦚 → next 🌳 → run1.\n\n4: 🌳 → next 🌱 → run1.\n\n5: 🌱 → next ☀️ → run1.\n\n6: ☀️ → next ☀️ → same. So run starts at 6. Next position7 is ☀️. Then next is 🌱 (position8). So run of 2. So add 1 here. Then position8: 🌱, next is ☀️ (position9). So run1.\n\nSo row9 has 1 horizontal line (positions6-7).\n\nSo summing the horizontal lines:\n\nRow0:1\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:0\n\nRow7:0\n\nRow8:1\n\nRow9:1\n\nTotal horizontal: 1+0+0+1+0+0+0+0+1+1=4.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, row8 has 1 (positions4-5, 🐓🐓). Row9 has positions6-7 (☀️☀️). So total horizontal lines are 4?\n\nWait, the count for horizontal lines:\n\nRow0:1\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow8:1\n\nRow9:1 → that's 4. Correct.\n\nNow columns. Need to check each column for vertical runs.\n\nEach column has 10 elements. For each column j (0-9), check from top to bottom (rows 0-9) for consecutive same emojis.\n\nLet's process each column.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nElements:\n\nRow0: 🐵\n\nRow1: ☀️\n\nRow2: ☀️\n\nRow3: 🌱\n\nRow4: 🐵\n\nRow5: 🌳\n\nRow6: 🐰\n\nRow7: 🐵\n\nRow8: 🌱\n\nRow9: ☀️\n\nSo check vertical runs.\n\nStart at row0: 🐵. Next is row1: ☀️ (diff). So run1.\n\nRow1: ☀️. Next is row2: ☀️ (same). Run length 2. Then row3 is 🌱 (diff). So add 1 for column0 here (run at row1-2). Then row3: 🌱 → next row4: 🐵 (diff). run1. row4: 🐵 → row5: 🌳 (diff). run1. row5: 🌳 → row6: 🐰 (diff). run1. row6: 🐰 → row7: 🐵 (diff). run1. row7: 🐵 → row8: 🌱 (diff). run1. row8: 🌱 → row9: ☀️ (diff). run1.\n\nSo column0 has 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow0: 🌾\n\nRow1: 🎁\n\nRow2: 🌳\n\nRow3: 🦚\n\nRow4: 🦚\n\nRow5: 🐵\n\nRow6: 🦚\n\nRow7: 🦚\n\nRow8: 🎁\n\nRow9: 🐓\n\nCheck vertical runs:\n\nRow0: 🌾 → row1: 🎁 → diff. run1.\n\nRow1: 🎁 → row2: 🌳 → diff. run1.\n\nRow2: 🌳 → row3: 🦚 → diff. run1.\n\nRow3: 🦚 → row4: 🦚 → same. run length 2. Next row5 is 🐵 → diff. add 1 here.\n\nRow4: 🦚 (already part of row3-4 run, which was counted).\n\nRow5: 🐵 → row6: 🦚 → diff. run1.\n\nRow6: 🦚 → row7: 🦚 → same. run length 2. Next row8: 🎁 → diff. add 1 here.\n\nRow7: 🦚 (part of row6-7 run).\n\nRow8: 🎁 → row9: 🐓 → diff. run1.\n\nSo column1 has 2 vertical lines (row3-4 and row6-7).\n\nColumn2:\n\nElements:\n\nRow0: 🌾\n\nRow1: 🐵\n\nRow2: 🐵\n\nRow3: 🐓\n\nRow4: 🐓\n\nRow5: 🦚\n\nRow6: 🐵\n\nRow7: 🐵\n\nRow8: ☀️\n\nRow9: 🐰\n\nCheck vertical runs:\n\nRow0: 🌾 → row1: 🐵 → diff. run1.\n\nRow1: 🐵 → row2: 🐵 → same. run length 2. Next row3: 🐓 → diff. add 1.\n\nRow2: 🐵 (part of row1-2 run).\n\nRow3: 🐓 → row4: 🐓 → same. run length 2. Next row5: 🦚 → diff. add 1.\n\nRow4: 🐓 (part of row3-4 run).\n\nRow5: 🦚 → row6: 🐵 → diff. run1.\n\nRow6: 🐵 → row7: 🐵 → same. run length 2. Next row8: ☀️ → diff. add 1.\n\nRow7: 🐵 (part of row6-7 run).\n\nRow8: ☀️ → row9: 🐰 → diff. run1.\n\nSo column2 has 3 vertical lines (row1-2, row3-4, row6-7).\n\nColumn3:\n\nElements:\n\nRow0: 🐓\n\nRow1: 🦚\n\nRow2: 🎁\n\nRow3: 🐵\n\nRow4: 🐵\n\nRow5: 🐰\n\nRow6: 🎁\n\nRow7: ☀️\n\nRow8: 🐰\n\nRow9: 🦚\n\nCheck vertical runs:\n\nRow0: 🐓 → row1: 🦚 → diff. run1.\n\nRow1: 🦚 → row2: 🎁 → diff. run1.\n\nRow2: 🎁 → row3: 🐵 → diff. run1.\n\nRow3: 🐵 → row4: 🐵 → same. run length 2. Add 1.\n\nRow4: 🐵 → row5: 🐰 → diff. run1.\n\nRow5: 🐰 → row6: 🎁 → diff. run1.\n\nRow6: 🎁 → row7: ☀️ → diff. run1.\n\nRow7: ☀️ → row8: 🐰 → diff. run1.\n\nRow8: 🐰 → row9: 🦚 → diff. run1.\n\nSo column3 has 1 vertical line (row3-4).\n\nColumn4:\n\nElements:\n\nRow0: 🌾\n\nRow1: ☀️\n\nRow2: 🌱\n\nRow3: 🌾\n\nRow4: 🌾\n\nRow5: 🌾\n\nRow6: 🌱\n\nRow7: 🐓\n\nRow8: 🐓\n\nRow9: 🌳\n\nCheck vertical runs:\n\nRow0: 🌾 → row1: ☀️ → diff. run1.\n\nRow1: ☀️ → row2: 🌱 → diff. run1.\n\nRow2: 🌱 → row3: 🌾 → diff. run1.\n\nRow3: 🌾 → row4: 🌾 → same. run length 2. Next row5: 🌾 (same). So run continues. Now the run is row3,4,5 (length 3). So after row5, row6 is 🌱 → diff. So add 1 for this run (length 3 counts as 1 line).\n\nRow4: part of the run.\n\nRow5: part of the run.\n\nRow6: 🌱 → row7: 🐓 → diff. run1.\n\nRow7: 🐓 → row8: 🐓 → same. run length 2. Next row9: 🌳 → diff. add 1.\n\nRow8: part of run.\n\nSo column4 has 2 vertical lines (rows3-5 (length3) and rows7-8 (length2)).\n\nColumn5:\n\nElements:\n\nRow0: 🌾\n\nRow1: 🐰\n\nRow2: 🐓\n\nRow3: 🎁\n\nRow4: 🌱\n\nRow5: 🌱\n\nRow6: 🐵\n\nRow7: 🐰\n\nRow8: 🐓\n\nRow9: 🌱\n\nCheck vertical runs:\n\nRow0: 🌾 → row1: 🐰 → diff. run1.\n\nRow1: 🐰 → row2: 🐓 → diff. run1.\n\nRow2: 🐓 → row3: 🎁 → diff. run1.\n\nRow3: 🎁 → row4: 🌱 → diff. run1.\n\nRow4: 🌱 → row5: 🌱 → same. run length 2.

Add 1 for the run from row5-7 (length3).\n\nRow6: part of run.\n\nRow7: part of run.\n\nRow8: 🐵 → row9: ☀️ → diff. run1.\n\nSo column6 has 1 vertical line (rows5-7).\n\nColumn7:\n\nElements:\n\nRow0: 🦚\n\nRow1: 🦚\n\nRow2: 🐵\n\nRow3: 🎁\n\nRow4: ☀️\n\nRow5: ☀️\n\nRow6: ☀️\n\nRow7: 🌾\n\nRow8: 🦚\n\nRow9: ☀️\n\nCheck vertical runs:\n\nRow0: 🦚 → row1: 🦚 → same. run length 2.

So 2 lines. Yes.\n\nColumn9 has two runs: row3-4 (run of 2), and rows5-8 (run of 4). Both count as 1 each. So 2 lines. Correct.\n\nSo vertical lines total 15. So total answer is 4+15=19?\n\nBut let me double-check some columns.\n\nColumn2:\n\nrow1-2 (run of 2), row3-4 (run of 2), row6-7 (run of 2). So 3 lines. Correct.\n\nColumn4 has two runs: rows3-5 (count as 1), and rows7-8 (count as 1). Correct.\n\nColumn7: two runs (row0-1 and row4-6). Correct.\n\nSo vertical is 15.\n\nHorizontal is 4.\n\nTotal 19.\n\nHmm. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in row8. Let me check row8 again.\n\nRow8 is: 🌱🎁☀️🐰🐓🐓🐵🦚🐵🌳.\n\nLooking for horizontal runs. The only run is the two 🐓 at positions4 and5. So yes, that's one line.\n\nRow9: ☀️🐓🐰🦚🌳🌱☀️☀️🌱☀️. The run is positions6-7 (☀️☀️). So yes.\n\nSo horizontal lines are 4.\n\nVertical lines 15. So total 19.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I missed some vertical runs.\n\nWait column7:\n\nRow0: 🦚\n\nRow1: 🦚 → same as row0. So run of 2. Count as 1.\n\nThen, row4 is ☀️, row5: ☀️, row6: ☀️. So that's run of 3. Count as 1. So column7 has 2 vertical lines. Correct.\n\nColumn9:\n\nRow3: 🐓, row4: 🐓 → run of 2. Count as 1.\n\nRow5: 🌳, row6: 🌳, row7: 🌳, row8: 🌳 → run of 4. Count as 1. So column9 has 2. Correct.\n\nSo total vertical lines sum to 15. Horizontal 4. So 19.\n\nBut wait, let me check row8 again. Row8's elements:\n\n🌱, 🎁, ☀️, 🐰, 🐓, 🐓, 🐵, 🦚, 🐵, 🌳.

I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with length 2 or more on this board. Hmm. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the board is given as several rows. Let me parse each row correctly. Looking at the input:\n\nThe first line is 🏄🐙🕷🦎🐙🦩🐙. That's the first row. Then there are six more rows. So the board is 7 rows by 7 columns, maybe? Let me check each row's length. Each row seems to have 7 emojis. So it's a 7x7 grid.\n\nNow, for each cell, I need to check horizontal and vertical directions. But lines of the same emoji that are 2 or longer. So for example, two in a row counts as one line. Three in a row would be considered as one line (since it's longer than 2), but also overlapping lines? Wait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji\" with length >=2. So each consecutive sequence of the same emoji in a line (horizontal or vertical) counts as one line if its length is at least 2.\n\nFor example, a horizontal sequence of three same emojis would count as one line. So each such consecutive sequence contributes 1 to the total count, regardless of its length (as long as it's >=2). But wait, if there's a line of 4 same emojis, that's a single line, so counts as 1.\n\nSo the approach is to scan each row for consecutive same emojis (horizontal lines) and each column for consecutive same emojis (vertical lines). For each such consecutive sequence of length >=2, add 1 to the total count.\n\nLet me try to process each row first.\n\nLet me list out all the rows again:\n\nRow 0: 🏄, 🐙, 🕷, 🦎, 🐙, 🦩, 🐙\n\nRow 1: 🦩, 🐙, 🐋, 🦎, 🦩, 🐙, 🦎\n\nRow 2: 🦩, 🦎, 🦎, 🏄, 🦩, 🏄, 🦎\n\nRow 3: 🏄, 🕷, 🕷, 🦩, 🦩, 🐙, 🦎\n\nRow 4: 🏄, 🏄, 🦩, 🕷, 🦩, 🕷, 🦎\n\nRow 5: 🐙, 🐙, 🦎, 🐙, 🐋, 🕷, 🕷\n\nRow 6: 🏄, 🕷, 🐙, 🏄, 🦩, 🦩, 🏄\n\nNow, let's go row by row and check horizontal lines.\n\nRow 0: Check each emoji in sequence.\n\nStart at index 0: 🏄. Next is 🐙. Different. So no run here.\n\nIndex 1: 🐙. Next is 🕷. Different. No run.\n\nIndex 2: 🕷. Next is 🦎. Different. No run.\n\nIndex3: 🦎. Next is 🐙. Different.\n\nIndex4: 🐙. Next is 🦩.

So run from 1-2 (length 2). So this counts as 1 horizontal line.\n\nWait, let me process the entire row step by step.\n\nRow2:\n\nPositions 0: 🦩\n\n1: 🦎\n\n2: 🦎\n\n3: 🏄\n\n4: 🦩\n\n5: 🏄\n\n6: 🦎\n\nCheck for consecutive same emojis.\n\nStart at 0: 🦩. Next is 🦎 (1). Different. Move to 1.\n\n1: 🦎. Next (2) is 🦎. Same. So current run starts at 1. Check how long it is.\n\nAfter 2, next is 3: 🏄. So run from 1-2 (length 2). So count 1 here.\n\nThen move to index3 (🏄). Next is 4: 🦩. Different.\n\nIndex4: 🦩. Next is 5: 🏄. Different.\n\nIndex5: 🏄. Next is 6: 🦎. Different.\n\nSo row2 has 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow3: 🏄, 🕷, 🕷, 🦩, 🦩, 🐙, 🦎\n\nProcessing:\n\nIndex0: 🏄. Next is 🕷. Different.\n\nIndex1: 🕷. Next (2) is 🕷. Same. Run starts here.\n\nCheck how long: index1 and 2 are same. Next, index3 is 🦩. So run from 1-2 (length 2). Counts as 1.\n\nThen index3: 🦩. Next (4) is 🦩. So run starts here. 3 and 4 are same. Next (5) is 🐙. So run from 3-4 (length 2). Another count. So row3 has 2 horizontal lines.\n\nSo row3 contributes 2.\n\nRow4: 🏄, 🏄, 🦩, 🕷, 🦩, 🕷, 🦎\n\nCheck:\n\nIndex0: 🏄. Next (1) is 🏄. Same. So run starts here. Next, index2 is 🦩. So run from 0-1 (length 2). Count 1.\n\nThen index2: 🦩. Next is 🕷. Different.\n\nIndex3: 🕷. Next is 🦩. Different.\n\nIndex4: 🦩. Next is 🕷. Different.\n\nIndex5: 🕷. Next is 🦎. Different.\n\nSo row4 has 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow5: 🐙, 🐙, 🦎, 🐙, 🐋, 🕷, 🕷\n\nProcessing:\n\nIndex0: 🐙. Next (1) is 🐙. Same. Then check next. Index2 is 🦎. So run from 0-1 (length 2). Count 1.\n\nThen, index2: 🦎. Next is 🐙 (3). Different.\n\nIndex3: 🐙. Next (4) is 🐋. Different.\n\nIndex5: 🕷. Next (6) is 🕷. Same. Run from 5-6 (length 2). Count 1.\n\nSo row5 has 2 horizontal lines.\n\nRow6: 🏄, 🕷, 🐙, 🏄, 🦩, 🦩, 🏄\n\nCheck:\n\nIndex0: 🏄. Next is 🕷. Different.\n\nIndex1: 🕷. Next is 🐙. Different.\n\nIndex2: 🐙. Next is 🏄. Different.\n\nIndex4: 🦩. Next (5) is 🦩. Same. So run from 4-5 (length 2). Count 1.\n\nIndex5: 🦩. Next (6) is 🏄. Different.\n\nSo row6 has 1 horizontal line.\n\nSo total horizontal lines: 0+0+1+2+1+2+1 = sum them up.\n\n0 (row0) + 0 (row1) +1 (row2) = 1, then +2 (row3) →3, +1 →4, +2 →6, +1 →7.\n\nSo horizontal lines count is 7.\n\nNow, check vertical lines. Each column has 7 elements. Let's check each column for consecutive same emojis.\n\nThere are 7 columns (columns 0-6).\n\nLet's go column by column.\n\nColumn0:\n\nRow0: 🏄\n\nRow1: 🦩\n\nRow2: 🦩\n\nRow3: 🏄\n\nRow4: 🏄\n\nRow5: 🐙\n\nRow6: 🏄\n\nSo the vertical sequence is: 🏄, 🦩, 🦩, 🏄, 🏄, 🐙, 🏄.\n\nCheck for runs:\n\nLooking for consecutive same.\n\nStart at row0: 🏄. Next row1: 🦩. Different. So no run here.\n\nRow1: 🦩. Next row2: 🦩. Same. So a run starts here. How long?\n\nRow1-2 (two in a row). Then row3 is 🏄. So run of 2. Count 1.\n\nRow3: 🏄. Next row4: 🏄. Same. So run starts here. Row3-4 (length 2). Count 1.\n\nRow5: 🐙. Next row6: 🏄. Different.\n\nSo column0 has 2 vertical lines.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to check all possible consecutive runs. Let me process each column properly.\n\nColumn0:\n\nPositions:\n\n0: 🏄\n\n1: 🦩\n\n2: 🦩\n\n3: 🏄\n\n4: 🏄\n\n5: 🐙\n\n6: 🏄\n\nNow, scan from top to bottom.\n\nStart at index0: current_emoji = 🏄. Next (1) is 🦩. Different. So move to index1.\n\nIndex1: 🦩. Next (2) is 🦩. So run starts here. The next is index2. So run from 1-2 (length 2). Count +=1. Then check index3 (which is 🏄). Different. So move to index3.\n\nIndex3: 🏄. Next (4) is 🏄. Same. Run from 3-4 (length 2). Count +=1. Then check index5 (🐙). Different. Move to index5: 🐙. Next (6) is 🏄. Different. So total vertical lines in column0: 2.\n\nColumn1:\n\nElements:\n\nRow0: 🐙\n\nRow1: 🐙\n\nRow2: 🦎\n\nRow3: 🕷\n\nRow4: 🏄\n\nRow5: 🐙\n\nRow6: 🕷\n\nLooking at column1:\n\n0:🐙, 1:🐙 → same.

Run from 0-1 (length 2). Count 1.\n\nThen row2: 🏄. Different.\n\nRow3: 🦩. Next row4: 🕷. Different.\n\nRow5: 🐙. Next row6: 🏄. Different.\n\nSo column3 has 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn4:\n\nElements:\n\nRow0: 🐙\n\nRow1: 🦩\n\nRow2: 🦩\n\nRow3: 🦩\n\nRow4: 🦩\n\nRow5: 🐋\n\nRow6: 🦩\n\nCheck:\n\nRow0: 🐙. Next row1: 🦩. Different.\n\nRow1: 🦩. Next row2: 🦩. Same. So run starts here. Let's see how far it goes. row1-2 (same). row3: 🦩. So run extends to row3. Then row4 is also 🦩. So the run is from row1 to row4 (length 4). So this counts as one vertical line.\n\nSo from row1 to row4, same emoji. So that's a run of 4, which counts as 1.\n\nWait, but each consecutive run of same emoji, regardless of length (as long as >=2). So even a 4-length run counts as 1.\n\nSo in column4:\n\nrow1 (🦩), row2 (🦩), row3 (🦩), row4 (🦩). So consecutive 4. So this counts as 1.\n\nThen row5 is 🐋. Different. Row6 is 🦩. Different. So column4 has 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn5:\n\nElements:\n\nRow0: 🦩\n\nRow1: 🐙\n\nRow2: 🏄\n\nRow3: 🐙\n\nRow4: 🕷\n\nRow5: 🕷\n\nRow6: 🦩\n\nCheck for consecutive same:\n\nRow0: 🦩. Next row1: 🐙. Different.\n\nRow1: 🐙. Next row2: 🏄. Different.\n\nRow2: 🏄. Next row3: 🐙. Different.\n\nRow3: 🐙. Next row4: 🕷. Different.\n\nRow4: 🕷. Next row5: 🕷. Same. So run starts here. row4-5 (length 2). Count 1.\n\nRow5: 🕷. Next row6: 🦩. Different.\n\nSo column5 has 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn6:\n\nElements:\n\nRow0: 🐙\n\nRow1: 🦎\n\nRow2: 🦎\n\nRow3: 🦎\n\nRow4: 🦎\n\nRow5: 🕷\n\nRow6: 🏄\n\nCheck:\n\nrow0: 🐙. row1: 🦎. Different.\n\nrow1: 🦎. row2: 🦎. Same. So run starts here. Then row3: 🦎. So run continues. row4: 🦎. So this is a run from row1 to row4 (4 same emojis). Counts as 1.\n\nThen row5: 🕷. Different. row6: 🏄. Different.\n\nSo column6's run is from row1-4. So 1 vertical line.\n\nSo let's sum up the vertical lines for each column:\n\nColumn0: 2\n\nColumn1: 1\n\nColumn2: 0\n\nColumn3: 1\n\nColumn4:1\n\nColumn5:1\n\nColumn6:1\n\nTotal vertical lines: 2+1+0+1+1+1+1= 7.\n\nSo total vertical lines are 7, and horizontal lines are 7. So total lines is 7+7=14.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me recheck the columns again to make sure.\n\nLet me recheck column4:\n\nelements:\n\nRow0: 🐙 (column4 row0?), wait wait. Wait, columns are numbered 0-6. Let's re-express the columns properly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in column indices. Let me make sure. The original board is 7 rows each with 7 elements. Each row's elements are in columns 0-6. For example, row0 is:\n\ncol0: 🏄, col1:🐙, col2:🕷, col3:🦎, col4:🐙, col5:🦩, col6:🐙.\n\nSo column4's elements are:\n\nrow0: 🐙\n\nrow1: 🦩\n\nrow2: 🦩\n\nrow3: 🦩\n\nrow4: 🦩\n\nrow5: 🐋\n\nrow6: 🦩\n\nAh, yes. So row0, column4 is 🐙. But in column4, the elements are:\n\nrow0: 🐙\n\nrow1: 🦩\n\nrow2: 🦩\n\nrow3: 🦩\n\nrow4: 🦩\n\nrow5: 🐋\n\nrow6: 🦩\n\nSo checking column4 vertically:\n\nrow0: 🐙. Next (row1) is 🦩. Different.\n\nrow1: 🦩. Next (row2) is 🦩. Same. Then row3 is 🦩. Then row4 is 🦩. So from row1 to row4, four same emojis. So this is a single run of length 4. So counts as 1 vertical line.\n\nSo column4 contributes 1.\n\nSo column4 is correct.\n\nSimilarly, column6:\n\nelements:\n\nrow0: 🐙\n\nrow1: 🦎\n\nrow2: 🦎\n\nrow3: 🦎\n\nrow4: 🦎\n\nrow5: 🕷\n\nrow6: 🏄\n\nSo from row1 to row4: four 🦎. So a run of 4, counts as 1.\n\nSo column6's vertical line count is 1.\n\nSo vertical lines total is 7.\n\nSo adding 7 horizontal and 7 vertical, total 14.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check all columns.\n\nColumn0's elements:\n\nrow0: 🏄\n\nrow1: 🦩\n\nrow2: 🦩\n\nrow3: 🏄\n\nrow4: 🏄\n\nrow5: 🐙\n\nrow6: 🏄\n\nSo vertical sequences:\n\nrow0: 🏄 → different from row1.\n\nrow1: 🦩 → same as row2 → run of 2 (count 1).\n\nrow3: 🏄 → same as row4 → run of 2 (count 1).\n\nSo total 2 for column0.\n\nYes.\n\nColumn1's elements:\n\nrow0: 🐙\n\nrow1: 🐙\n\nrow2: 🦎\n\nrow3: 🕷\n\nrow4: 🏄\n\nrow5: 🐙\n\nrow6: 🕷\n\nRun in rows0-1 (🐙🐙) → count 1.\n\nNo others. So column1 has 1.\n\nColumn3's elements:\n\nrow0: 🦎\n\nrow1: 🦎\n\nrow2: 🏄\n\nrow3: 🦩\n\nrow4: 🕷\n\nrow5: 🐙\n\nrow6: 🏄\n\nRows0-1 (🦎🦎) → count 1.\n\nOthers are different. So column3 has 1.\n\nColumn5's elements:\n\nrow0: 🦩\n\nrow1: 🐙\n\nrow2: 🏄\n\nrow3: 🐙\n\nrow4: 🕷\n\nrow5: 🕷\n\nrow6: 🦩\n\nRuns: row4-5 (🕷🕷) → count 1.\n\nOthers are different. So column5 has 1.\n\nSo vertical lines total 2 (column0) +1 (1) +0 (col2) +1 (col3) +1 (col4) +1 (col5) +1 (col6) → 2+1+0+1+1+1+1=7.\n\nHorizontal lines were 7. So total is 14.\n\nWait, but let me recheck the horizontal lines again. Let me recount each row's contribution.\n\nRow0: 0.\n\nRow1:0.\n\nRow2:1.\n\nRow3:2.\n\nRow4:1.\n\nRow5:2.\n\nRow6:1.\n\n0+0=0; +1=1; +2=3; +1=4; +2=6; +1=7. Yes.\n\nSo 7 horizontal and 7 vertical, total 14. But wait, perhaps there are more vertical lines I missed.\n\nLet me check column5 again.\n\nColumn5's elements:\n\nrow0: 🦩 (col5, row0)\n\nrow1: 🐙\n\nrow2: 🏄\n\nrow3: 🐙\n\nrow4: 🕷\n\nrow5: 🕷\n\nrow6: 🦩\n\nSo runs in column5: row4 and row5 (🕷, 🕷). So yes, 1.\n\nWhat about column6:\n\nrows1-4: 🦎 four times. So that's a run of 4, counts as 1.\n\nAnother possibility: are there any other vertical runs?\n\nColumn4's run is row1-4 (4 emojis). So that's 1.\n\nHmm. All seems correct. So total vertical lines are 7.\n\nSo adding both directions, 14.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in processing vertical runs. For example, in column0:\n\nrows 3-4 are 🏄🏄. That's a separate run. So 2 runs in column0: row1-2 (🦩🦩) and row3-4 (🏄🏄). So two runs. So yes.\n\nBut the vertical lines are counted as per each consecutive sequence. So even if there's a gap, each run counts as 1. So yes, column0 has two vertical lines.\n\nSo the answer would be 14. But let me double-check if there's any other line I missed.\n\nLet's take another look at row3:\n\n🏄, 🕷, 🕷, 🦩, 🦩, 🐙, 🦎\n\nHorizontal runs: positions 1-2 (🕷🕷), and 3-4 (🦩🦩). So two lines.\n\nRow5: 🐙🐙, then 🕷🕷. So two lines.\n\nRow6: positions4-5 (🦩🦩). So one line.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nVertical lines:\n\nIn column6: rows1-4 (four 🦎). Counts as 1.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed a vertical line in column2. Let's check column2 again.\n\nColumn2:\n\nrow0: 🕷\n\nrow1: 🐋\n\nrow2: 🦎\n\nrow3: 🕷\n\nrow4: 🦩\n\nrow5: 🦎\n\nrow6: 🐙\n\nAll elements are different from their next. So no vertical lines here. Correct.\n\nSo the total is 14. So the answer should be 14. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the vertical line count.\n\nWait, column0 has 2 vertical lines (row1-2 and row3-4). Yes. Column1 has one (row0-1). Column3 has one (row0-1). Column4 has one (row1-4). Column5 has one (row4-5). Column6 has one (row1-4). So total vertical lines: 2+1+0+1+1+1+1=7.\n\nYes. So sum is 7+7=14.\n\nSo the answer should be 14.\n\n\nAnswer: 14"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Let me think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the board is made up of rows of emojis. Each row is a horizontal line, and each column would form the vertical lines. So for each emoji in the grid, I need to check both horizontally and vertically if there's a consecutive line of the same emoji of length 2 or more. But wait, the problem says lines. So a line here is a consecutive sequence. So maybe the same as in games like finding runs in a row or column.\n\nWait, the question is to count all such lines. But lines can be of length 2, 3, etc. But each individual line of length 2 or more counts as one. For example, a horizontal line of 3 same emojis would count as one line. But wait, if a line of length 4 has multiple overlapping lines, like 3 runs of 2 (positions 1-2, 2-3, 3-4), but in this problem, do we count each possible line or just each maximal line? Hmm, the problem statement says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". So perhaps each maximal consecutive sequence. Because otherwise, a longer line would contribute multiple lines. But the problem says \"the number of horizontal or vertical lines\", so maybe count each maximal line (each consecutive run) of length >=2 once. For example, a horizontal sequence of 4 same emojis would count as one line of length 4, not three (since 2,3,4; but perhaps the problem counts each run once). So the approach is to scan each row and column and count the number of runs (consecutive sequences) of length 2 or more.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. For each row, check for consecutive runs in horizontal direction. For each run of length 2 or more, add 1 to the count.\n2. For each column, check for consecutive runs in vertical direction. For each run of length 2 or more, add 1 to the count.\n3. Sum all these counts to get the answer.\n\nSo now I need to process the given board, row by row and column by column.\n\nLooking at the input board, the user provided a 10x10 grid (since there are 10 rows, each with 10 emojis). Let's represent each row as a list of strings.\n\nWait, the user provided the board as:\n\nRow 1: 🐥🍁🐕🌏🍁🧽🐆🐥🍁🌏\nRow 2: 🐆🦍🌟🐠🦍🌏🐕🐕🌟🐍\nRow 3: 🍁🦍🦍🧽🌏🐠🌏🐕🐠🐠\nRow 4: 🐥🌏🐆🧽🐥🐍🐕🌟🌏🐆\nRow 5: 🧽🐆🐆🍁🌟🐥🐆🐠🌟🧽\nRow 6: 🧽🐥🐥🌟🐥🦍🐆🐥🐠🐕\nRow 7: 🐆🧽🌟🍁🌏🐆🐍🌏🐥🌟\nRow 8: 🐍🧽🐆🍁🐍🐥🐕🧽🧽🐥\nRow 9: 🧽🌏🌏🐠🐠🌟🌏🦍🌏🧽\nRow 10: 🍁🧽🌏🍁🐕🧽🧽🐍🐍🐥\n\nEach row has 10 emojis. So it's a 10x10 grid.\n\nNow, the process would be:\n\nFor each row, process horizontally. Let's take row 1 as an example:\n\nRow 1: 🐥 🍁 🐕 🌏 🍁 🧽 🐆 🐥 🍁 🌏\n\nLooking for consecutive sequences. Let's go through each element:\n\n- 🐥 (pos 0): next is 🍁, different. So no run here.\n- 🍁 (pos1): next is 🐕, different.\n- 🐕 (pos2): next is 🌏, different.\n- 🌏 (pos3): next is 🍁, different.\n- 🍁 (pos4): next is 🧽, different.\n- 🧽 (pos5): next is 🐆, different.\n- 🐆 (pos6): next is 🐥, different.\n- 🐥 (pos7): next is 🍁, different.\n- 🍁 (pos8): next is 🌏, different.\nSo in row 1, no horizontal lines of length >=2. So count 0 here.\n\nWait, wait. Maybe I need to check for consecutive same emojis. For example, in row 2:\n\nRow 2: 🐆 🦍 🌟 🐠 🦍 🌏 🐕 🐕 🌟 🐍\n\nLooking at positions 6 and 7: 🐕 🐕. So that's a run of 2. So this contributes 1 to the horizontal count.\n\nAnother example: row 3:\n\nRow3: 🍁 🦍 🦍 🧽 🌏 🐠 🌏 🐕 🐠 🐠\n\nPositions 1 and 2: 🦍 🦍 → run of 2. Positions 8 and 9: 🐠 🐠 → run of 2. So two horizontal lines here.\n\nSimilarly, for vertical lines, looking for consecutive same in columns. For example, column 0:\n\nCheck each row's 0th element:\n\nRow1: 🐥\n\nRow2: 🐆\n\nRow3: 🍁\n\nRow4: 🐥\n\nRow5: 🧽\n\nRow6: 🧽\n\nRow7: 🐆\n\nRow8: 🐍\n\nRow9: 🧽\n\nRow10: 🍁\n\nSo vertical column 0:\n\nLooking for consecutive same emojis. Let's see:\n\nRow1: 🐥 → next is row2's 🐆: different. So no run here.\n\nRow5 and 6: 🧽 and 🧽 (rows 5 and 6's 0th element are both 🧽? Wait, row5's 0th element is 🧽 (yes). Row6's 0th element is 🧽. So in column 0, row5 and 6 (positions 5 and 6 if 0-based) have consecutive same. That's a vertical run of 2. So that's 1 vertical line.\n\nWait, but if the column has multiple runs. Like if in column 0, rows 5,6,7 have same emojis, but rows 5 and 6 are 🧽, row7 is 🐆. Then rows 5-6 form a run of 2, so count 1. But if there's a longer run, like 3, it's still counted as one line.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each row, check horizontal runs. For each run of consecutive same emojis (length >=2), add 1.\n\nFor each column, check vertical runs. Similarly, each run of consecutive same emojis (length >=2), add 1.\n\nNow, the challenge is to process each row and column correctly.\n\nLet me start by writing down all the rows and columns.\n\nBut since this is time-consuming, perhaps I can find a systematic way to process each row and column.\n\nFirst, process all horizontal lines.\n\nLet's process each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: 🐥🍁🐕🌏🍁🧽🐆🐥🍁🌏\n\nLooking for consecutive same emojis.\n\nCheck each pair:\n\n1-2: 🐥-🍁 → no.\n\n2-3: 🍁-🐕 → no.\n\n3-4: 🐕-🌏 → no.\n\n4-5: 🌏-🍁 → no.\n\n5-6: 🍁-🧽 → no.\n\n6-7: 🧽-🐆 → no.\n\n7-8: 🐆-🐥 → no.\n\n8-9: 🐥-🍁 → no.\n\n9-10: 🍁-🌏 → no.\n\nNo runs in row 1. So count 0.\n\nRow 2: 🐆🦍🌟🐠🦍🌏🐕🐕🌟🐍\n\nCheck each position:\n\nPositions 0-1: 🐆-🦍 → no.\n\n1-2: 🦍-🌟 → no.\n\n2-3: 🌟-🐠 → no.\n\n3-4: 🐠-🦍 → no.\n\n4-5: 🦍-🌏 → no.\n\n5-6: 🌏-🐕 → no.\n\n6-7: 🐕-🐕 → same. So this is a run of 2. So we need to check the entire consecutive. So from 6 to 7: two same. So this is a run of length 2. So count +=1.\n\n7-8: 🐕-🌟 → no.\n\n8-9: 🌟-🐍 → no.\n\nSo row 2 contributes 1.\n\nRow 3: 🍁🦍🦍🧽🌏🐠🌏🐕🐠🐠\n\nCheck positions:\n\n0-1: 🍁-🦍 → no.\n\n1-2: 🦍-🦍 → same. So this is a run. Let's see how long. At position 1 and 2. Then check position 3: 🧽. So the run is 2 long. So count +=1.\n\nThen positions 2-3: 🦍-🧽 → no.\n\n3-4: 🧽-🌏 → no.\n\n4-5: 🌏-🐠 → no.\n\n5-6: 🐠-🌏 → no.\n\n6-7: 🌏-🐕 → no.\n\n7-8: 🐕-🐠 → no.\n\n8-9: 🐠-🐠 → same. Run of 2. So count +=1.\n\nSo row 3 contributes 2.\n\nRow4: 🐥🌏🐆🧽🐥🐍🐕🌟🌏🐆\n\nCheck each consecutive pairs:\n\n0-1: 🐥-🌏 → no.\n\n1-2: 🌏-🐆 → no.\n\n2-3: 🐆-🧽 → no.\n\n3-4: 🧽-🐥 → no.\n\n4-5: 🐥-🐍 → no.\n\n5-6: 🐍-🐕 → no.\n\n6-7: 🐕-🌟 → no.\n\n7-8: 🌟-🌏 → no.\n\n8-9: 🌏-🐆 → no.\n\nSo no runs in row4. Count 0.\n\nRow5: 🧽🐆🐆🍁🌟🐥🐆🐠🌟🧽\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\n0-1: 🧽-🐆 → no.\n\n1-2: 🐆-🐆 → same. Run starts here. Check next: position3 is 🍁. So run is length 2. Count +=1.\n\n2-3: 🐆-🍁 → no.\n\n3-4: 🍁-🌟 → no.\n\n4-5: 🌟-🐥 → no.\n\n5-6: 🐥-🐆 → no.\n\n6-7: 🐆-🐠 → no.\n\n7-8: 🐠-🌟 → no.\n\n8-9: 🌟-🧽 → no.\n\nSo row5 contributes 1.\n\nRow6: 🧽🐥🐥🌟🐥🦍🐆🐥🐠🐕\n\nCheck pairs:\n\n0-1: 🧽-🐥 → no.\n\n1-2: 🐥-🐥 → same. Run of 2. Count +=1.\n\nCheck next: position3 is 🌟. So run ends. So 1 run here.\n\n2-3: 🐥-🌟 → no.\n\n3-4: 🌟-🐥 → no.\n\n4-5: 🐥-🦍 → no.\n\n5-6: 🦍-🐆 → no.\n\n6-7: 🐆-🐥 → no.\n\n7-8: 🐥-🐠 → no.\n\n8-9: 🐠-🐕 → no.\n\nBut wait, positions 1 and 2 are 🐥🐥. Also, positions 3 is 🌟, but what about position4: 🐥. So after position2, the run is 2. So count 1.\n\nBut then in positions 3-4: 🌟-🐥 → no. But position4 (🐥) could be part of another run if there's consecutive after. For example, position4 and 5: 🐥-🦍 → no. So row6 contributes 1.\n\nRow7: 🐆🧽🌟🍁🌏🐆🐍🌏🐥🌟\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\n0-1: 🐆-🧽 → no.\n\n1-2: 🧽-🌟 → no.\n\n2-3: 🌟-🍁 → no.\n\n3-4: 🍁-🌏 → no.\n\n4-5: 🌏-🐆 → no.\n\n5-6: 🐆-🐍 → no.\n\n6-7: 🐍-🌏 → no.\n\n7-8: 🌏-🐥 → no.\n\n8-9: 🐥-🌟 → no.\n\nNo runs in row7. Count 0.\n\nRow8: 🐍🧽🐆🍁🐍🐥🐕🧽🧽🐥\n\nCheck consecutive pairs:\n\n0-1: 🐍-🧽 → no.\n\n1-2: 🧽-🐆 → no.\n\n2-3: 🐆-🍁 → no.\n\n3-4: 🍁-🐍 → no.\n\n4-5: 🐍-🐥 → no.\n\n5-6: 🐥-🐕 → no.\n\n6-7: 🐕-🧽 → no.\n\n7-8: 🧽-🧽 → same. So run of 2. Count +=1.\n\n8-9: 🧽-🐥 → no.\n\nSo row8 contributes 1.\n\nRow9: 🧽🌏🌏🐠🐠🌟🌏🦍🌏🧽\n\nCheck pairs:\n\n0-1: 🧽-🌏 → no.\n\n1-2: 🌏-🌏 → same. Run of 2. Count +=1.\n\n2-3: 🌏-🐠 → no.\n\n3-4: 🐠-🐠 → same. Run of 2. Count +=1.\n\n4-5: 🐠-🌟 → no.\n\n5-6: 🌟-🌏 → no.\n\n6-7: 🌏-🦍 → no.\n\n7-8: 🦍-🌏 → no.\n\n8-9: 🌏-🧽 → no.\n\nSo row9 contributes 2.\n\nRow10 (assuming it's the last row provided by the user as the 10th row, but in the input given, perhaps there's a typo. Let me check the original input again:\n\nThe user provided the board as:\n\nRow 10: 🍁🧽🌏🍁🐕🧽🧽🐍🐍🐥\n\nSo row10 is 🍁🧽🌏🍁🐕🧽🧽🐍🐍🐥.\n\nCheck consecutive pairs:\n\n0-1: 🍁-🧽 → no.\n\n1-2: 🧽-🌏 → no.\n\n2-3: 🌏-🍁 → no.\n\n3-4: 🍁-🐕 → no.\n\n4-5: 🐕-🧽 → no.\n\n5-6: 🧽-🧽 → same. Run of 2. Count +=1.\n\n6-7: 🧽-🐍 → no.\n\n7-8: 🐍-🐍 → same. Run of 2. Count +=1.\n\n8-9: 🐍-🐥 → no.\n\nSo row10 contributes 2.\n\nSo summing up the horizontal lines:\n\nRow1: 0\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:2\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:1\n\nRow7:0\n\nRow8:1\n\nRow9:2\n\nRow10:2\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 0+1+2+0+1+1+0+1+2+2 = 10.\n\nNow, processing vertical lines. This is more complex because each column has 10 elements.\n\nThere are 10 columns (0 to 9). For each column, check consecutive runs in vertical direction (i.e., from top to bottom, same emoji in adjacent rows).\n\nLet's process each column:\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRows (0-9, row indices 0-based):\n\nRow0: 🐥\n\nRow1: 🐆\n\nRow2: 🍁\n\nRow3: 🐥\n\nRow4: 🧽\n\nRow5: 🧽\n\nRow6: 🐆\n\nRow7: 🐍\n\nRow8: 🧽\n\nRow9: 🍁\n\nCheck consecutive runs:\n\nCompare row0 and row1: 🐥 vs 🐆 → different.\n\nRow1 and row2: 🐆 vs 🍁 → different.\n\nRow2 and row3: 🍁 vs 🐥 → different.\n\nRow3 and row4: 🐥 vs 🧽 → different.\n\nRow4 and row5: 🧽 vs 🧽 → same. Run starts here. Check how long:\n\nRow4,5,6: 🧽,🧽, 🐆 → the run is between row4 and row5 (length 2). So count +=1.\n\nRow5 and row6: 🧽 vs 🐆 → different.\n\nRow6 and row7: 🐆 vs 🐍 → different.\n\nRow7 and row8: 🐍 vs 🧽 → different.\n\nRow8 and row9: 🧽 vs 🍁 → different.\n\nSo column0 has 1 vertical run.\n\nColumn 0: count 1.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow0: 🍁\n\nRow1: 🦍\n\nRow2: 🦍\n\nRow3: 🌏\n\nRow4: 🐆\n\nRow5: 🐥\n\nRow6: 🧽\n\nRow7: 🧽\n\nRow8: 🌏\n\nRow9: 🧽\n\nCheck consecutive runs:\n\nRow0 and 1: 🍁 vs 🦍 → no.\n\nRow1 and 2: 🦍 vs 🦍 → same. Run of 2. Count +=1.\n\nRow2 and3: 🦍 vs 🌏 → no.\n\nRow3 and4: 🌏 vs 🐆 → no.\n\nRow4 and5: 🐆 vs 🐥 → no.\n\nRow5 and6: 🐥 vs 🧽 → no.\n\nRow6 and7: 🧽 vs 🧽 → same. Run of 2. Count +=1.\n\nRow7 and8: 🧽 vs 🌏 → no.\n\nRow8 and9: 🌏 vs 🧽 → no.\n\nSo column1 has two runs: (row1-2 and row6-7).\n\nTotal column1: 2.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow0: 🐕\n\nRow1: 🌟\n\nRow2: 🦍\n\nRow3: 🐆\n\nRow4: 🐆\n\nRow5: 🐥\n\nRow6: 🌟\n\nRow7: 🐆\n\nRow8: 🌏\n\nRow9: 🌏\n\nCheck consecutive pairs:\n\nRow0-1: 🐕 vs 🌟 → no.\n\nRow1-2: 🌟 vs 🦍 → no.\n\nRow2-3: 🦍 vs 🐆 → no.\n\nRow3-4: 🐆 vs 🐆 → same. Run of 2. Count +=1.\n\nRow4-5: 🐆 vs 🐥 → no.\n\nRow5-6: 🐥 vs 🌟 → no.\n\nRow6-7: 🌟 vs 🐆 → no.\n\nRow7-8: 🐆 vs 🌏 → no.\n\nRow8-9: 🌏 vs 🌏 → same. Run of 2. Count +=1.\n\nSo column2: two runs (rows3-4 and 8-9). Count 2.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRows:\n\nRow0: 🌏\n\nRow1: 🐠\n\nRow2: 🧽\n\nRow3: 🧽\n\nRow4: 🍁\n\nRow5: 🌟\n\nRow6: 🍁\n\nRow7: 🍁\n\nRow8: 🐠\n\nRow9: 🍁\n\nCheck consecutive pairs:\n\nRow0-1: 🌏 vs 🐠 → no.\n\nRow1-2: 🐠 vs 🧽 → no.\n\nRow2-3: 🧽 vs 🧽 → same.

Count +=1.\n\nRow7-8: 🍁 vs 🐠 → no.\n\nRow8-9: 🐠 vs 🍁 → no.\n\nSo column3: two runs (rows2-3 and 6-7).

I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more on this board. Hmm. The board is 10x10, right? Each cell has an emoji, and I have to check both rows and columns for consecutive same emojis. But wait, what's considered a line here? Like, if there's a sequence of 3 same emojis in a row, does that count as one line of length 3? Or does each possible consecutive pair in that line count as separate lines? Oh, right, the problem says \"length of 2 or more\", so the line must be exactly length 2 or longer. Wait, but how does that translate into counts. For example, a horizontal line of 3 same emojis would contribute one line (since it's a single line of length 3). Similarly, a line of 4 would count as one. So each maximal consecutive sequence in a row or column counts as one line if its length is >=2.\n\nSo the approach is: check each row for consecutive sequences of same emojis, count each such occurrence where the sequence is length 2 or more. Then do the same for each column. Sum all those counts.\n\nSo first, process each row. For each row, iterate through the emojis, track current emoji and current run length. When the next emoji is the same, increment the run. When it changes, check if the current run is >=2. If so, add 1 to the count. Then reset the current run. At the end of the row, check again if the remaining run is >=2.\n\nRepeat this for all rows and columns.\n\nNow let's look at the given board. It's a 10x10 grid. Let's go row by row and column by column.\n\nBut since the emojis are a bit complex, maybe I can assign each a unique symbol or number to make it easier. But since they are all different emojis, perhaps it's better to compare them directly.\n\nLet me start with the first row:\n\nRow 0: 🦍 🦢 🐛 🦢 🌓 🦞 🦞 ⭐️ 🦞 🦩\n\nLooking for horizontal sequences. Let's list them step by step:\n\nPositions 0-9 (indexes 0-based):\n\n0: 🦍\n1: 🦢 (different, check previous. Run was 1, so nothing. New run starts at 1)\n2: 🐛 (different. Run was 1. New run starts at 2)\n3: 🦢 (different. Run 1. New run)\n4: 🌓 (different. Run 1)\n5: 🦞. Different from previous. New run. Then 5 and 6 are same 🦞. So at 5: run starts. At 6, same. So run length is 2. So this counts as a horizontal line. Then position 7 is ⭐️ (different. So the run ends here. Add 1 to count. Then position 7: new run. 8 is 🦞, same as previous (⭐️?) No. Wait, position 7 is ⭐️, then 8 is 🦞, different. So run for position7 is 1. Then 8 is 🦞, same as position 5-6? No, position 8 is 🦞. Wait, after position6 is 🦞 (6 is index 6), then 7 is ⭐️. So the run from 5-6 is two 🦞. So count +=1. Then position7: ⭐️, which is a run of 1. Then position8 is 🦞 again. Run of 1. Then position9: 🦩, different. So no more counts.\n\nSo in row 0, horizontal lines count as 1 (the two 🦞 in positions 5-6). Wait, but position 8 is also 🦞. Let me check again. Wait, row 0 is:\n\n5: 🦞\n6: 🦞 (same, run is 2)\n7: ⭐️ (different, so the run of 2 ends here. So count +=1. Then, position 8 is 🦞 (different from ⭐️, so new run of 1. Position9 is 🦩, different. So run ends. So only one horizontal line in row 0.\n\nRow 0 horizontal count: 1.\n\nNow row 1:\n\nRow 1: 🦢 🐏 🦢 🦍 🦩 🐛 🐏 ⭐️ 🌓 🦞\n\nCheck each consecutive.\n\nPosition0: 🦢. Position1: 🐏 (different). Run was 1, so nothing. Then position1: 🐏. Position2: 🦢 (different). Run 1. Then position3: 🦍. And so on. I don't see any consecutive same emojis here. So row1 has 0 horizontal lines.\n\nRow 2:\n\n🐆 🦢 🐏 🐏 🦞 🦞 🦢 🦩 ⭐️ 🐛\n\nLooking for consecutive in row.\n\nPositions 0: 🐆. 1: 🦢 (different). Run 1.\n\nPosition2: 🐏. Position3: 🐏. So run of 2. So count +=1. Then position4: 🦞. Different from 🐏. So that's one line. Position4: 🦞. Position5: 🦞 (same). So run of 2. Count +=1. Then position6: 🦢 (different). So now total for row 2: 2 lines (🐏🐏 and 🦞🦞).\n\nSo row2 horizontal count: 2.\n\nRow3:\n\n🦢 🦞 🦍 🦢 🦩 🦍 🦞 🐏 🐏 🦍\n\nCheck consecutive.\n\nPosition0: 🦢. 1: 🦞 (different). Run 1.\n\nPosition3: 🦢. Position4: 🦩. Different. So no.\n\nLooking for runs:\n\nAt positions6-7: 🦞 and 🐏 (different). Position7-8: 🐏 and 🐏. So run of 2. So count +=1. So row3 horizontal count: 1 (the 🐏🐏 at positions7-8? Wait, positions7 and 8 are indexes 7 and 8? Let's see. Row3: indexes 0-9.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow3: 0:🦢, 1:🦞, 2:🦍, 3:🦢, 4:🦩, 5:🦍, 6:🦞, 7:🐏, 8:🐏,9:🦍.\n\nSo positions7 and 8 are 🐏 and 🐏. So that's a run of 2. So count +=1. Are there any others in row3? Let's check:\n\nLooking for consecutive same:\n\n0: no. 1: 🦞 next is 🦍? No. Then 2: 🦍 next is 🦢? No. 3: 🦢 next is 🦩. No. 4: 🦩 next is 🦍. No. 5: 🦍 next is 🦞. No. 6: 🦞 next is 🐏. No. 7: 🐏 next is 🐏 (counted). 8: next is 🦍. So row3 has 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow3 count:1.\n\nRow4:\n\n🦢 🌓 🦍 🐛 🦢 🐏 🦞 🐏 🌓 🦍\n\nCheck for consecutive same.\n\nLooking through each pair:\n\n0: 🦢 next is 🌓. Different. 1: 🌓 next is 🦍. Different. 2: 🦍 next is 🐛. Different. 3: 🐛 next is 🦢. Different. 4: 🦢 next is 🐏. Different. 5: 🐏 next is 🦞. Different. 6: 🦞 next is 🐏. Different. 7: 🐏 next is 🌓. Different. 8: 🌓 next is 🦍. Different. So row4 has no consecutive same pairs. So row4 horizontal count:0.\n\nRow5:\n\n🦍 🐆 🦩 🐆 🦢 🦢 🌓 ⭐️ 🦞 🦞\n\nLooking for runs.\n\nPositions4-5: 🦢🦢. Run of 2. Count +=1.\n\nPositions8-9: 🦞🦞. Run of 2. Count +=1.\n\nOther positions: check.\n\n0: 🦍, next 🐆. Different. 1: 🐆 next 🦩. Different. 2: 🦩 next 🐆. Different. 3: 🐆 next 🦢. Different. 5: 🦢 next 🌓. Different. 6: 🌓 next ⭐️. Different. 7: ⭐️ next 🦞. Different. So row5 has two horizontal lines. Count:2.\n\nRow5 count:2.\n\nRow6:\n\n🐏 🦢 🐏 🦞 🦍 🐏 🐆 🦍 🐏 🐛\n\nLooking for consecutive same.\n\nCheck each pair:\n\n0: 🐏 next 🦢. Different.\n\n1: 🦢 next 🐏. Different.\n\n2: 🐏 next 🦞. Different.\n\n3: 🦞 next 🦍. Different.\n\n4: 🦍 next 🐏. Different.\n\n5: 🐏 next 🐆. Different.\n\n6: 🐆 next 🦍. Different.\n\n7: 🦍 next 🐏. Different.\n\n8: 🐏 next 🐛. Different.\n\nNo consecutive same. So row6 count:0.\n\nRow7:\n\n🐛 🦍 ⭐️ 🌓 🦍 🌓 🐏 🦩 🐆 🐛\n\nCheck for runs.\n\nNo consecutive same in any pair. Row7 count:0.\n\nRow8:\n\n🐛 🦩 🦍 ⭐️ 🦍 🦩 🌓 🐏 🐛 🐆\n\nCheck each pair. All pairs seem to be different. So count 0.\n\nRow9:\n\n🦞 🐛 🦢 🐛 🦞 🌓 🐛 🐏 🐛 🐆\n\nLooking for runs.\n\nCheck each pair:\n\n0: 🦞 next 🐛. Different.\n\n1: 🐛 next 🦢. Different.\n\n2: 🦢 next 🐛. Different.\n\n3: 🐛 next 🦞. Different.\n\n4: 🦞 next 🌓. Different.\n\n5: 🌓 next 🐛. Different.\n\n6: 🐛 next 🐏. Different.\n\n7: 🐏 next 🐛. Different.\n\n8: 🐛 next 🐆. Different.\n\nNo runs. Row9 count:0.\n\nSo total horizontal lines: row0 (1) + row1 (0) + row2 (2) + row3 (1) + row4 (0) + row5 (2) + row6 (0) + row7 (0) + row8 (0) + row9 (0). Summing: 1+0+2+1+0+2+0+0+0+0 = 6 horizontal lines.\n\nNow columns. Need to check each column for consecutive same emojis. For each of the 10 columns, check vertical sequences.\n\nLet's start with column 0.\n\nColumn0 (first column):\n\nRow0: 🦍\n\nRow1: 🦢\n\nRow2: 🐆\n\nRow3: 🦢\n\nRow4: 🦢\n\nRow5: 🦍\n\nRow6: 🐏\n\nRow7: 🐛\n\nRow8: 🐛\n\nRow9: 🦞\n\nLooking for vertical runs. Let's check each row in column0.\n\nCompare row0 and row1: 🦍 vs 🦢 (different).\n\nRow1 vs row2: 🦢 vs 🐆 (different).\n\nRow2 vs row3: 🐆 vs 🦢 (different).\n\nRow3 vs row4: 🦢 vs 🦢 (same). So run starts here. Let's see:\n\nRow3: 🦢 (row3 column0), row4: 🦢. So two in a row. Then check row5: 🦍 (different). So this is a vertical run of 2. Count +=1. So column0 has one vertical line (rows3-4).\n\nWait, but how to check for runs longer than 2. For example, if there's a run of 3 in a column, like same emojis in rows 0,1,2. Then that's a single line of length 3, so counts as one.\n\nSo in column0, the run at rows3 and4 (two in a row). So count +=1.\n\nNow column1:\n\nColumn1 (second column, index1):\n\nRow0: 🦢\n\nRow1: 🐏\n\nRow2: 🦢\n\nRow3: 🦞\n\nRow4: 🌓\n\nRow5: 🐆\n\nRow6: 🦢\n\nRow7: 🦍\n\nRow8: 🦩\n\nRow9: 🐛\n\nCheck consecutive pairs:\n\nrow0 and1: 🦢 vs 🐏. Different.\n\nrow1 and2: 🐏 vs 🦢. Different.\n\nrow2 and3: 🦢 vs 🦞. Different.\n\nrow3 and4: 🦞 vs 🌓. Different.\n\nrow4 and5: 🌓 vs 🐆. Different.\n\nrow5 and6: 🐆 vs 🦢. Different.\n\nrow6 and7: 🦢 vs 🦍. Different.\n\nrow7 and8: 🦍 vs 🦩. Different.\n\nrow8 and9: 🦩 vs 🐛. Different.\n\nNo vertical runs here. So column1 count:0.\n\nColumn2:\n\nColumn2 (index2):\n\nRow0: 🐛\n\nRow1: 🦢\n\nRow2: 🐏\n\nRow3: 🦍\n\nRow4: 🦍\n\nRow5: 🦩\n\nRow6: 🐏\n\nRow7: ⭐️\n\nRow8: 🦍\n\nRow9: 🦢\n\nCheck for runs.\n\nrow0: 🐛. row1: 🦢. Different.\n\nrow1: 🦢. row2: 🐏. Different.\n\nrow2: 🐏. row3: 🦍. Different.\n\nrow3: 🦍. row4: 🦍. Same. So run starts here. Check row5: 🦩. Different. So run is 2. So count +=1.\n\nrow4: 🦍 and row5: 🦩. Different.\n\nOther pairs:\n\nrow5: 🦩 vs row6: 🐏. Different.\n\nrow6: 🐏 vs row7: ⭐️. Different.\n\nrow7: ⭐️ vs row8: 🦍. Different.\n\nrow8: 🦍 vs row9: 🦢. Different.\n\nSo column2 has 1 vertical line (rows3-4).\n\nColumn2 count:1.\n\nColumn3:\n\nColumn3 (index3):\n\nRow0: 🦢\n\nRow1: 🦍\n\nRow2: 🐏\n\nRow3: 🦢\n\nRow4: 🐛\n\nRow5: 🐆\n\nRow6: 🦞\n\nRow7: 🌓\n\nRow8: ⭐️\n\nRow9: 🐛\n\nCheck consecutive pairs:\n\nrow0 and1: 🦢 vs 🦍. Different.\n\nrow1 and2: 🦍 vs 🐏. Different.\n\nrow2 and3: 🐏 vs 🦢. Different.\n\nrow3 and4: 🦢 vs 🐛. Different.\n\nrow4 and5: 🐛 vs 🐆. Different.\n\nrow5 and6: 🐆 vs 🦞. Different.\n\nrow6 and7: 🦞 vs 🌓. Different.\n\nrow7 and8: 🌓 vs ⭐️. Different.\n\nrow8 and9: ⭐️ vs 🐛. Different.\n\nNo runs. Column3 count:0.\n\nColumn4 (index4):\n\nRow0: 🌓\n\nRow1: 🦩\n\nRow2: 🦞\n\nRow3: 🦩\n\nRow4: 🦢\n\nRow5: 🦢\n\nRow6: 🦍\n\nRow7: 🦍\n\nRow8: 🦍\n\nRow9: 🦞\n\nLooking for runs.\n\nrow0: 🌓, row1: 🦩. Different.\n\nrow1: 🦩, row2: 🦞. Different.\n\nrow2: 🦞, row3: 🦩. Different.\n\nrow3: 🦩, row4: 🦢. Different.\n\nrow4: 🦢, row5: 🦢. Same. So run of 2. Then row5: 🦢, row6: 🦍. Different. So count +=1.\n\nrow6: 🦍, row7: 🦍. Same. Run of 2. Then row7: 🦍, row8: 🦍. Same. So run continues to 3. Then row8: 🦍, row9: 🦞. Different. So this is a run of 3 (rows6-8), which counts as one line. So total for column4: two vertical lines. The first from rows4-5 (🦢🦢) and rows6-8 (🦍🦍🦍). Wait, but the run in rows6-8 is a single run of 3, which counts as one line. So column4 count is 2.\n\nWait, let's recheck.\n\nLooking at column4:\n\nIndices 4 for each row:\n\nrow0: 🌓\n\nrow1: 🦩\n\nrow2: 🦞\n\nrow3: 🦩\n\nrow4: 🦢\n\nrow5: 🦢\n\nrow6: 🦍\n\nrow7: 🦍\n\nrow8: 🦍\n\nrow9: 🦞\n\nSo check vertically:\n\nrow4 and5: 🦢 and 🦢: run of 2. So count +=1.\n\nrow6,7,8: 🦍, 🦍, 🦍. So that's a run of 3. So that's another line. So column4 has two vertical lines. So column4 count:2.\n\nColumn4 count:2.\n\nColumn5 (index5):\n\nRow0: 🦞\n\nRow1: 🐛\n\nRow2: 🦞\n\nRow3: 🦍\n\nRow4: 🐏\n\nRow5: 🌓\n\nRow6: 🐏\n\nRow7: 🌓\n\nRow8: 🦩\n\nRow9: 🌓\n\nLooking for consecutive same.\n\nrow0: 🦞, row1: 🐛.

Different.\n\nrow7: 🌓, row8: 🦩. Different.\n\nrow8: 🦩, row9: 🌓. Different.\n\nNo runs. Column5 count:0.\n\nColumn6 (index6):\n\nRow0: 🦞\n\nRow1: 🐏\n\nRow2: 🦢\n\nRow3: 🦞\n\nRow4: 🦞\n\nRow5: ⭐️\n\nRow6: 🐆\n\nRow7: 🐏\n\nRow8: 🌓\n\nRow9: 🐛\n\nCheck for consecutive same.\n\nrow0: 🦞, row1: 🐏. Different.\n\nrow1: 🐏, row2: 🦢. Different.\n\nrow2: 🦢, row3: 🦞. Different.\n\nrow3: 🦞, row4: 🦞. Same. Run of 2. So count +=1.\n\nrow4: 🦞, row5: ⭐️. Different.\n\nOther pairs:\n\nrow5: ⭐️ vs 🐆 (row6). Different.\n\nrow6: 🐆 vs row7: 🐏. Different.\n\nrow7: 🐏 vs row8: 🌓. Different.\n\nrow8: 🌓 vs row9: 🐛. Different.\n\nSo column6 count:1 (rows3-4).\n\nColumn6 count:1.\n\nColumn7 (index7):\n\nRow0: ⭐️\n\nRow1: ⭐️\n\nRow2: 🦩\n\nRow3: 🐏\n\nRow4: 🐏\n\nRow5: ⭐️\n\nRow6: 🦍\n\nRow7: 🦩\n\nRow8: 🐏\n\nRow9: 🐏\n\nCheck consecutive same.\n\nrow0 and1: ⭐️ and ⭐️. Same. Run of 2. Then row2: 🦩, different. So count +=1.\n\nrow3 and4: 🐏 and 🐏. Run of 2. count +=1.\n\nrow8 and9: 🐏 and 🐏. Run of 2. count +=1.\n\nSo wait, let's go through each pair:\n\nrow0: ⭐️\n\nrow1: ⭐️: same. Run starts. Then row2: 🦩 (different). So run of 2 (rows0-1). Count +=1.\n\nrow3: 🐏. row4: 🐏. Same. Run of 2. Count +=1.\n\nrow4: 🐏. row5: ⭐️. Different.\n\nrow5: ⭐️. row6: 🦍. Different.\n\nrow6: 🦍. row7: 🦩. Different.\n\nrow7: 🦩. row8: 🐏. Different.\n\nrow8: 🐏. row9: 🐏. Same. Run of 2. Count +=1.\n\nSo column7 has three vertical lines. So count:3.\n\nColumn7 count:3.\n\nColumn8 (index8):\n\nRow0: 🦞\n\nRow1: 🌓\n\nRow2: ⭐️\n\nRow3: 🐏\n\nRow4: 🌓\n\nRow5: 🦞\n\nRow6: 🐏\n\nRow7: 🐆\n\nRow8: 🐛\n\nRow9: 🐛\n\nCheck for runs.\n\nrow0: 🦞, row1: 🌓.

Different.\n\nrow7: 🐆, row8: 🐛. Different.\n\nrow8: 🐛, row9: 🐛. Same. Run of 2. Count +=1.\n\nSo column8 has 1 vertical line (rows8-9).\n\nColumn8 count:1.\n\nColumn9 (index9):\n\nRow0: 🦩\n\nRow1: 🦞\n\nRow2: 🐛\n\nRow3: 🦍\n\nRow4: 🦍\n\nRow5: 🦞\n\nRow6: 🐛\n\nRow7: 🐛\n\nRow8: 🐆\n\nRow9: 🐆\n\nCheck for vertical runs.\n\nrow0: 🦩, row1: 🦞.

So, the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines made up of the same emoji, and each line has to be of length 2 or more. The total count of such lines is what we need to find.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board structure. The board is given as rows of emojis. Let me look at the provided board:\n\nRow 1: 🏄🏄🐧🐧🐠🐧\nRow 2: 🐧🐧🏄🏄🐧🏄\nRow 3: 🐠🏄🐠🐆🐧🏄\nRow 4: 🐠🐆🐆🏄🏄🐆\nRow 5: 🐧🐧🐠🐧🐆🐆\nRow 6: 🐆🐧🐠🐧🐠🐧\n\nEach row has 6 emojis. There are 6 rows, so the board is 6x6.\n\nNow, I need to check all possible horizontal and vertical lines. For each line (horizontal in a row, vertical in a column), I need to find sequences of the same emoji with length >=2. But wait, the problem says lines formed by the same emoji. So each line is a consecutive sequence. For example, in a horizontal line, if a row has three same emojis in a row, that's one line of length 3. But if they are part of a longer line, like four in a row, that's considered as one line of length 4. Wait, but the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So each maximal consecutive sequence of the same emoji in a horizontal or vertical direction counts as one line. So for example, in a row like 🏄🏄🏄, there's one horizontal line of length 3. If a row is 🏄🏄🐧🏄🏄, then there are two horizontal lines (each of length 2). But wait, in the vertical case, it's similar. For a column, check consecutive same emojis.\n\nWait, but how to count overlapping sequences. For example, a sequence of length 3 in a row counts as one line, not two (like 3 in a row would have two possible lines of length 2, but they are overlapping). But according to standard problem definitions, I think each maximal consecutive run counts as one line. So if there's a run of 3 same emojis, that's one line (counted once, regardless of being length 3). So the count is based on the number of runs (of length >=2) in each row and column.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the question says \"number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So each such line is a consecutive sequence of the same emoji, and each such sequence is a separate line. So for example, in a horizontal line, each run of the same emoji with length >=2 in a row is one line. Similarly for vertical.\n\nBut let me confirm. For example, in a row like 🏄🏄🏄, that's a single horizontal line of length 3, so counts as 1. In a row like 🏄🏄🐧🏄🏄, there are two separate runs (each of length 2) of 🏄, so that's two horizontal lines. Similarly, a vertical run of three same emojis in a column counts as one vertical line. So the approach is:\n\nFor each row, scan left to right, find all consecutive runs of the same emoji, and for each run of length >=2, count 1. Sum all those counts for all rows (horizontal lines). Then do the same for each column (vertical lines). Sum the horizontal and vertical counts for the total.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each row in the board, check each horizontal run. For example, first row is 🏄🏄🐧🐧🐠🐧. Split into runs: 2 🏄, 2 🐧, 1 🐠, 1 🐧. So here, two runs of >=2, so horizontal lines in this row contribute 2.\n\n2. For each column in the board, check each vertical run. For example, column 0: let's look. The first column is:\n\nRow 1: 🏄\n\nRow 2: 🐧\n\nRow 3: 🐠\n\nRow 4: 🐠\n\nRow 5: 🐧\n\nRow 6: 🐆\n\nSo the first column is 🏄, 🐧, 🐠, 🐠, 🐧, 🐆. So vertical runs here would be: 1 (🏄), 1 (🐧), 2 (🐠), 1 (🐧), 1 (🐆). So in this column, there's one vertical run of length 2 (the two 🐠 in rows 3 and 4), so contributes 1 to the vertical lines.\n\nSo first, process each row. Then each column. Then sum.\n\nSo I need to:\n\n- For each row:\n\n   Split into runs, count runs with length >=2.\n\n- For each column:\n\n   Split into runs, count runs with length >=2.\n\nSum all.\n\nNow, the problem is to process the given board.\n\nLet's start with the rows.\n\nProcessing each row:\n\nRow 1: 🏄🏄🐧🐧🐠🐧 → runs:\n\n🏄 x2 → count 1\n\n🐧 x2 → count 1\n\nothers are 1, so total 2.\n\nRow 2: 🐧🐧🏄🏄🐧🏄\n\nRuns:\n\n🐧x2 → 1\n\n🏄x2 →1\n\n🐧x1, 🏄x1. So total 2.\n\nRow 3: 🐠🏄🐠🐆🐧🏄\n\nEach run is 1, except maybe 🐧 and 🏄 at the end (but 🐧 is 1, 🏄 is 1. So no runs >=2. So this row contributes 0.\n\nWait row 3: 🐠 (1), 🏄 (1), 🐠 (1), 🐆 (1), 🐧 (1), 🏄 (1). All single, so 0.\n\nRow 4: 🐠🐆🐆🏄🏄🐆\n\nRuns:\n\n🐠x1\n\n🐆x2 → count 1\n\n🏄x2 → count 1\n\n🐆x1. So total 2.\n\nRow 5: 🐧🐧🐠🐧🐆🐆\n\nRuns:\n\n🐧x2 →1\n\n🐠x1\n\n🐧x1\n\n🐆x2 →1. Total 2.\n\nRow 6: 🐆🐧🐠🐧🐠🐧\n\nEach emoji is single: runs are 1. So 0.\n\nSo horizontal lines: rows 1 (2), 2 (2), 4 (2), 5 (2). Others are 0. So sum 2+2+2+2=8 horizontal lines.\n\nNow vertical lines: need to check each column.\n\nLet's process each column (columns 0 to 5):\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRows 1-6:\n\n🏄, 🐧, 🐠, 🐠, 🐧, 🐆\n\nRuns:\n\n🏄 (1), then 🐧 (1), then 🐠 (2) → count 1, then 🐧 (1), then 🐆 (1). So total 1 run in this column.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow 1: 🏄\n\nRow 2: 🐧\n\nRow 3: 🏄\n\nRow 4: 🐆\n\nRow 5: 🐧\n\nRow 6: 🐧\n\nSo entries: 🏄, 🐧, 🏄, 🐆, 🐧, 🐧.\n\nRuns:\n\n🏄 (1), 🐧 (1), 🏄 (1), 🐆 (1), 🐧 (2) → count 1. So total 1.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow1: 🐧\n\nRow2: 🏄\n\nRow3: 🐠\n\nRow4: 🐆\n\nRow5: 🐠\n\nRow6: 🐠\n\nEntries: 🐧, 🏄, 🐠, 🐆, 🐠, 🐠.\n\nRuns: all 1 except last two entries (🐠 x2). So runs:\n\n🐧 (1), 🏄 (1), 🐠 (1), 🐆 (1), 🐠 (2) → count 1. So column 2 contributes 1.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow1: 🐧\n\nRow2: 🏄\n\nRow3: 🐆\n\nRow4: 🏄\n\nRow5: 🐧\n\nRow6: 🐧\n\nEntries: 🐧, 🏄, 🐆, 🏄, 🐧, 🐧.\n\nRuns:\n\n🐧 (1), 🏄 (1), 🐆 (1), 🏄 (1), 🐧 (2) → count 1.\n\nSo column3 contributes 1.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow1: 🐠\n\nRow2: 🐧\n\nRow3: 🐧\n\nRow4: 🏄\n\nRow5: 🐆\n\nRow6: 🐠\n\nEntries: 🐠, 🐧, 🐧, 🏄, 🐆, 🐠.\n\nRuns:\n\n🐠 (1), 🐧 (2) → count 1, 🏄 (1), 🐆 (1), 🐠 (1). So column4 has a run of 2 (🐧x2 in rows 2 and3). So contributes 1.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow1: 🐧\n\nRow2: 🏄\n\nRow3: 🏄\n\nRow4: 🐆\n\nRow5: 🐆\n\nRow6: 🐧\n\nEntries: 🐧, 🏄, 🏄, 🐆, 🐆, 🧑? Wait, let's check row6's last emoji. The problem lists row6 as 🐆🐧🐠🐧🐠🐧. So column5 is row1: 🐧, row2: 🏄, row3: 🏄, row4: 🐆, row5: 🐆, row6: 🐧.\n\nSo the entries for column5 are:\n\nRow1: 🐧 (index 5?), wait the rows as given:\n\nRow1: 🏄🏄🐧🐧🐠🐧 → positions 0-5.\n\nSo for row1, column5 is the last emoji, which is 🐧.\n\nRow2: 🐧🐧🏄🏄🐧🏄 → column5 is 🏄.\n\nRow3: 🐠🏄🐠🐆🐧🏄 → column5 is 🏄.\n\nRow4: 🐠🐆🐆🏄🏄🐆 → column5 is 🐆.\n\nRow5: 🐧🐧🐠🐧🐆🐆 → column5 is 🐆.\n\nRow6: 🐆🐧🐠🐧🐠🐧 → column5 is 🐧.\n\nSo column5 entries are: 🐧 (row1), 🏄 (row2), 🏄 (row3), 🐆 (row4), 🐆 (row5), 🐧 (row6).\n\nSo runs:\n\n🐧 (1), 🏄 (2) → count 1, 🐆 (2) → count 1, 🐧 (1). So total 2 runs here. So column5 contributes 2.\n\nWait, let's process column5's entries:\n\nRow1: 🐧 → count 1.\n\nRow2: 🏄 → new run (start at row2). So run of 🏄 from row2 to row3: row2's 🏄 and row3's 🏄. So that's 2, so count 1. Then row4 is 🐆, which starts a new run (row4: 🐆, row5: 🐆 → 2, count 1). Then row6 is 🐧 (1). So total in column5: 2 runs (length 2 each). So column5 contributes 2.\n\nSo now, the vertical lines per column:\n\nColumn0: 1\n\nColumn1: 1\n\nColumn2: 1\n\nColumn3: 1\n\nColumn4: 1\n\nColumn5: 2\n\nTotal vertical lines: 1+1+1+1+1+2 =7.\n\nSo horizontal lines sum to 8, vertical lines sum to 7. Total answer is 8+7=15?\n\nWait wait, let's recheck all the counts.\n\nHorizontal lines:\n\nRow1: 2 runs (🏄x2, 🐧x2) → 2.\n\nRow2: 2 runs (🐧x2, 🏄x2) → 2.\n\nRow3: no runs → 0.\n\nRow4: two runs (🐆x2, 🏄x2) → 2.\n\nRow5: two runs (🐧x2, 🐆x2) → 2.\n\nRow6: no runs →0.\n\nSo sum horizontal is 2+2+2+2 =8. Correct.\n\nVertical lines:\n\nEach column:\n\nColumn0: 1 run (🐠x2).\n\nColumn1: 1 run (🐧x2 in rows5 and6? Wait in column1:\n\nLooking again at column1's entries:\n\nRow1: 🏄\n\nRow2: 🐧\n\nRow3: 🏄\n\nRow4: 🐆\n\nRow5: 🐧\n\nRow6: 🐧\n\nSo the entries are:\n\nRow1: 🏄 (1)\n\nRow2: 🐧 (1)\n\nRow3: 🏄 (1)\n\nRow4: 🐆 (1)\n\nRow5: 🐧 (1)\n\nRow6: 🐧 (1) → Wait, no. Wait row5's column1 is the second element. Let me recheck the rows.\n\nOriginal board:\n\nRow1: 🏄🏄🐧🐧🐠🐧 → column1 is 🏄.\n\nRow2: 🐧🐧🏄🏄🐧🏄 → column1 is 🐧.\n\nRow3: 🐠🏄🐠🐆🐧🏄 → column1 is 🏄.\n\nRow4: 🐠🐆🐆🏄🏄🐆 → column1 is 🐆.\n\nRow5: 🐧🐧🐠🐧🐆🐆 → column1 is 🐧.\n\nRow6: 🐆🐧🐠🐧🐠🐧 → column1 is 🐧.\n\nSo entries for column1:\n\nRow1: 🏄\n\nRow2: 🐧\n\nRow3: 🏄\n\nRow4: 🐆\n\nRow5: 🐧\n\nRow6: 🐧\n\nSo the runs here are:\n\n🏄 (1), 🐧 (1), 🏄 (1), 🐆 (1), 🐧 (2) → the last two entries (rows5 and6) are 🐧x2. So that's a run of length 2. So column1 contributes 1.\n\nSo column1's runs are:\n\n1. 🏄 (1), 2. 🐧 (1), 3. 🏄 (1), 4. 🐆 (1), 5. 🐧 (2). So one run of length 2 → count 1.\n\nSo column1 is 1.\n\nColumn5:\n\nAs before, runs are 🏄x2 and 🐆x2 → count 2.\n\nSo vertical lines sum to 1 (col0) +1 (col1) +1 (col2) +1 (col3) +1 (col4) +2 (col5) → total 7.\n\nSo total vertical is 7.\n\nSo 8 +7 =15.\n\nWait but let's check column2 again.\n\nColumn2:\n\nEntries for each row:\n\nRow1: 🐧 (third column, row1's emojis are positions 0-5: first two 🏄, then two 🐧, then 🐠 and 🐧. So column2 is the third emoji, which is the first 🐧 in the pair.\n\nRow1's column2: 🐧.\n\nRow2's column2: third emoji. Row2 is 🐧🐧🏄🏄🐧🏄 → columns 0-5. So column2 is 🏄.\n\nRow3's column2: third emoji is 🐠 (row3: 🐠🏄🐠🐆🐧🏄 → column2 is 🐠.\n\nRow4's column2: third emoji is 🐆 (row4: 🐠🐆🐆🏄🏄🐆 → column2 is 🐆.\n\nRow5's column2: third emoji is 🐠 (row5: 🐧🐧🐠🐧🐆🐆 → column2 is 🐠.\n\nRow6's column2: third emoji is 🐠 (row6: 🐆🐧🐠🐧🐠🐧 → column2 is 🐠.\n\nSo column2 entries:\n\nRow1: 🐧\n\nRow2: 🏄\n\nRow3: 🐠\n\nRow4: 🐆\n\nRow5: 🐠\n\nRow6: 🐠\n\nSo the runs here are:\n\n🐧 (1) → run1.\n\n🏄 (1) → run2.\n\n🐠 (1) → run3.\n\n🐆 (1) → run4.\n\n🐠 (2) → rows5 and6. So run5 is 🐠x2. So this contributes 1 to the vertical count. So column2 contributes 1. Correct.\n\nColumn4's entries:\n\nRow1: 🐠 (position4)\n\nRow2: 🐧 (position4)\n\nRow3: 🐧 (position4)\n\nRow4: 🏄 (position4)\n\nRow5: 🐆 (position4)\n\nRow6: 🐠 (position4).\n\nSo entries are 🐠, 🐧, 🐧, 🏄, 🐆, 🐠.\n\nRuns:\n\n🐠 (1) → run1.\n\n🐧 (2) → rows2 and3. So this run is of length 2 → count 1.\n\nThen 🏄 (1), 🐆 (1), 🐠 (1). So column4 has 1 vertical run. Correct.\n\nSo vertical sum is 7.\n\nThus, total answer is 8+7=15.\n\nBut wait, let's check the column5 again.\n\nColumn5's entries:\n\nRow1: 🐧\n\nRow2: 🏄\n\nRow3: 🏄\n\nRow4: 🐆\n\nRow5: 🐆\n\nRow6: 🐧\n\nSo the runs:\n\n🐧 (1).\n\n🏄x2 (rows2 and3) → run of 2 → count 1.\n\n🐆x2 (rows4 and5) → run of 2 → count 1.\n\n🐧 (1).\n\nSo total runs in column5: 2 (each of length 2). So contributes 2. Correct.\n\nSo vertical lines are 7. Horizontal 8. Total 15.\n\nSo the answer should be 15.\n\n\nAnswer: 15"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

So, the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more. Hmm. Let me make sure I understand the problem correctly.\n\nFirst, the board is made up of emojis arranged in a grid. Each line (horizontal or vertical) must consist of the same emoji, and the length has to be at least 2. And each such line contributes to the total count. But wait, wait. Do lines that are part of longer lines count multiple times? Like, if there's a line of 3 in a row, does that count as two lines (since there are two overlapping lines of length 2)? Or is each maximal line counted once regardless of length?\n\nThe problem statement says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more.\" So perhaps each contiguous sequence of the same emoji in a line (horizontal or vertical) counts as one if its length is >=2. For example, a horizontal line of 3 same emojis would count as one line. But then again, maybe the problem counts each possible consecutive pair as a separate line? That's unclear. The problem needs to be clarified here. \n\nWait, the example given in the problem's first line says \"length of 2 or more\". So for example, a horizontal line of 3 same emojis would count as a single line of length 3, which is valid, and thus contributes 1 to the total count. Similarly, a vertical line of 2 same emojis would count as 1. But if there's a vertical line of 4, that's still 1. So each maximal line (contiguous and same emoji) counts as 1, provided its length is >=2. So the total is the number of such maximal lines in both horizontal and vertical directions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each possible pair or longer sequence in a row or column is counted. For example, a horizontal line of 3 same emojis would contribute 2: two possible lines of length 2 (positions 1-2 and 2-3). But that approach would complicate things. However, the problem statement is a bit ambiguous here. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe original problem says: \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So it's the lines themselves. For example, if there are three in a row horizontally, that's a single line of length 3. So that's one entry. So each consecutive same emojis in a line, whether horizontal or vertical, count as one if their length is >=2.\n\nSo the approach is to check each row and column for sequences of the same emojis, count each such sequence (of length 2 or more) once, and sum all those counts.\n\nNow, looking at the given board:\n\nThe board is a 5-row grid. Let's write out the rows as given:\n\nRow 0: 🐘🐘🦇🦇🤚\n\nRow 1: 🐘🦇🐘🦇🤚\n\nRow 2: 🦇🐘🦇🐘🦇\n\nRow 3: 🦇🐘🐘🤚🤚\n\nRow 4: 🤚🤚🐘🤚🤚\n\nFirst, let's process the horizontal lines. For each row, check consecutive same emojis and count sequences of length >=2.\n\nLet's go row by row.\n\nRow 0: [\"🐘\", \"🐘\", \"🦇\", \"🦇\", \"🤚\"]\n\nLooking at the first two 🐘: that's a sequence of 2 → count 1.\n\nNext, after that, two 🦇: another sequence of 2 → count 1.\n\nThe last is 🤚, which is length 1. So row 0 contributes 2.\n\nRow 1: [\"🐘\", \"🦇\", \"🐘\", \"🦇\", \"🤚\"]\n\nEach emoji alternates. So sequences are all single. So no contribution here. So 0.\n\nRow 2: [\"🦇\", \"🐘\", \"🦇\", \"🐘\", \"🦇\"]\n\nEach emoji alternates again. So no sequences of 2. So 0.\n\nRow 3: [\"🦇\", \"🐘\", \"🐘\", \"🤚\", \"🤚\"]\n\nFirst is 🦇 (1), then 🐘🐘 (length 2 → count 1), then 🤚🤚 (length 2 → count 1). So row 3 contributes 2.\n\nRow 4: [\"🤚\", \"🤚\", \"🐘\", \"🤚\", \"🤚\"]\n\nFirst two 🤚: sequence of 2 → count 1. Then 🐘 (1). Then two 🤚 → another sequence of 2. So row 4 contributes 2.\n\nNow, summing horizontal lines: 2 (row 0) + 0 + 0 + 2 (row3) + 2 (row4) = 6.\n\nNow check vertical lines. For each column, check consecutive same emojis in vertical direction (i.e., down the rows). For each column, process from top to bottom.\n\nThere are 5 columns (each row has 5 elements). Let's check each column.\n\nColumn 0 (index 0):\n\nRow 0: 🐘\n\nRow1: 🐘 → same as row0.\n\nRow2: 🦇 → different. So the first two 🐘 form a vertical line of length 2 → count 1.\n\nRow3: 🦇 → different from row2. So no.\n\nRow4: 🤚 → different. So column0 has one vertical line (rows0-1).\n\nColumn1 (index1):\n\nRow0: 🐘\n\nRow1: 🦇 → different. So possible line from row0 only (length1).\n\nRow2: 🐘 → row1 is 🦇, so row2 is different. So no vertical line here.\n\nRow3: 🐘 → same as row2? Let's see. Wait, column1:\n\nRow0: 🐘\n\nRow1: 🦇 (so different from row0. So no line in rows0-1.\n\nRow1 is 🦇, row2 is 🐘 (different). Row3's column1 is 🐘. So row2 and row3: 🐘 and 🐘? So that's a vertical line of length 2 (rows2-3). Then row4's column1 is 🤚, which is different. So vertical lines in column1: rows2-3 → count 1.\n\nSo column1 contributes 1.\n\nColumn2 (index2):\n\nRow0: 🦇\n\nRow1: 🐘 → different. So no line here.\n\nRow2: 🦇 → compare to row1 (🐘). Different. So row2's 🦇 is alone.\n\nRow3: 🐘 → different from row2. Row4's column2: 🐘. So row3 and row4: 🐘 and 🐘? So vertical line of length 2 (rows3-4). So that's 1.\n\nSo column2 contributes 1.\n\nColumn3 (index3):\n\nRow0: 🦇\n\nRow1: 🦇 → same as row0. So that's 2.\n\nRow2: 🐘 → different. So vertical line in rows0-1: length 2 → count 1.\n\nRow3: 🤚 → different. Row4: 🤚 → same as row3. So rows3-4: length 2 → count another 1. So column3 has two vertical lines: rows0-1 and rows3-4. So that's 2.\n\nColumn3's total is 2.\n\nColumn4 (index4):\n\nRow0: 🤚\n\nRow1: 🤚 → same. So that's 2.\n\nRow2: 🦇 → different. So vertical line rows0-1: length 2 → count 1.\n\nRow3: 🤚 → different from row2. So rows3 is 🤚. Row4's column4: 🤚. So rows3-4: length 2 → count 1. So column4 has two vertical lines: rows0-1 and rows3-4. So total 2.\n\nNow, vertical lines sum: column0 (1) + column1 (1) + column2 (1) + column3 (2) + column4 (2) → 1+1+1+2+2=7.\n\nWait, let's recheck.\n\nWait, column3:\n\nRows0: 🦇\n\nRow1: 🦇 → same. So rows0-1: 2. So count 1.\n\nThen, rows3-4: 🤚 and 🤚 → 2. Another count. So total 2.\n\nSimilarly for column4.\n\nSo vertical lines total is 7.\n\nSo adding horizontal (6) and vertical (7), the total is 6 +7 = 13.\n\nBut wait, let me recheck each column.\n\nColumn0:\n\nRow0: 🐘\n\nRow1: 🐘 → same → so that's 2. Then row2 is 🦇. So the vertical line is rows0-1 → count 1. Correct.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow0: 🐘 → row1 is 🦇 → different. So no line here. Row2 is 🐘 (column1). Then row3 is 🐘 (column1). So rows2-3: two same. So count 1. Correct.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: 🦇 → row1 is 🐘 (different). Row2 is 🦇 → different from row1. Row3 is 🐘. Row4 is 🐘. So rows3-4: same. So count 1. Correct.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🦇, row1: 🦇 → same (count 1). Then row2: 🐘 (different). Row3: 🤚, row4: 🤚 → same (count another 1). So total 2.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow0: 🤚, row1: 🤚 → same (count 1). Row2: 🦇 (different). Row3: 🤚, row4: 🤚 → same (count 1). So column4 has 2.\n\nSo vertical lines: 1 (col0) +1 (col1) +1 (col2) +2 (col3) +2 (col4) = 7.\n\nHorizontal lines: 2 (row0) +0 (row1) +0 (row2) +2 (row3) +2 (row4) =6.\n\nTotal 6+7=13.\n\nBut wait, in row3, the sequence is 🦇, then 🐘🐘 (count 1), then 🤚🤚 (count 1). So two sequences. Yes.\n\nIn row4, the first two 🤚 are a sequence (count 1), then after 🐘, the last two 🤚 (count 1). So total two.\n\nWait, for row4: [🤚,🤚,🐘,🤚,🤚]. The first two are a sequence (count 1), the next is single (🐘), then two 🤚 (count another 1). So yes, two in row4.\n\nSo horizontal lines sum to 2+0+0+2+2=6.\n\nVertical lines sum to 7.\n\nTotal 13.\n\nIs that the correct answer?\n\nHmm. Let me check again to make sure.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to list all possible lines.\n\nHorizontal lines:\n\nRow0: 🐘🐘 (2) → 1 line. 🦇🦇 (2) → 1. Total 2.\n\nRow3: 🐘🐘 (2) → 1. 🤚🤚 (2) →1. Total 2.\n\nRow4: 🤚🤚 (1st and 2nd) →1. Then in positions 3 and 4: 🤚🤚? Wait, row4 is [🤚,🤚,🐘,🤚,🤚]. So positions 3 and 4 are 🤚 and 🤚. So that's another sequence. So yes, two in row4.\n\nSo row4's two sequences are positions 0-1 and 3-4. Each is length 2. So two lines. So correct.\n\nVertical lines:\n\nColumn0:\n\nRows0-1: 🐘🐘 (2) →1.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRows2-3: 🐘🐘 →1.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRows3-4: 🐘🐘 →1.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRows0-1: 🦇🦇 →1. Rows3-4: 🤚🤚 →1. So 2.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRows0-1: 🤚🤚 →1. Rows3-4: 🤚🤚 →1. So 2.\n\nSo columns 0-4: 1,1,1,2,2 → sum 7.\n\nYes. So vertical lines 7.\n\nTotal 6+7=13.\n\nSo the answer should be 13.\n\n\nAnswer: 13"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The lines must be at least length 2. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that lines can be horizontal (same row, consecutive columns) or vertical (same column, consecutive rows). Each line is counted once, but I have to make sure that if there's a longer line, like 3 in a row, that counts as one line. Wait, no, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more.\" So even if there's a longer line, like 3 same emojis in a row, each possible consecutive segment of 2 or more contributes. Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"lines\" which are length 2 or more. But in such cases, a line of length 3 would have two possible lines of length 2 (overlapping), but maybe the problem counts each maximal line. Or maybe the problem considers each maximal consecutive sequence as a single line. For example, a row like 🐦🐦🐦 would count as one line of length 3. Since the problem says \"length of 2 or more,\" the count for each such maximal sequence. So each consecutive sequence of the same emoji in a row (horizontal) or column (vertical) that is length >=2 counts as one.\n\nSo the task is to go through each row and count the number of horizontal runs of the same emoji with length >=2. Then do the same for each column for vertical runs. Sum all those counts.\n\nSo first, process all rows. For each row, check consecutive emojis. For example, in row 0:\n\nFirst row: 🐦🌍🌵🌍🌘🦭🐞🦑🦑🦢\n\nLooking for consecutive same emojis. Let's see:\n\nPositions 0-1: 🐦 vs 🌍 → no. Then positions 1-2: 🌍 vs 🌵 → no. 2-3: 🌵 vs 🌍 → no. 3-4: 🌍 vs 🌘 → no. 4-5: 🌘 vs 🦭 → no. 5-6: 🦭 vs 🐞 → no. 6-7: 🐞 vs 🦑 → no. 7-8: 🦑 vs 🦑 → same. So this starts a possible run. Let's see how long this run is. Positions 7-9: 🦑🦑🦢. So positions 7 and 8 are same. That's a run of 2. So in row 0, there's one horizontal line here.\n\nThen row 1: 🦢🌍🦢🐞🌘🌍🦭🌍🌍🐞\n\nLooking for consecutive same. Let's check each pair.\n\nPositions 0-1: 🦢 vs 🌍 → no. 1-2: 🌍 vs 🦢 → no. 2-3: 🦢 vs 🐞 → no. 3-4: 🐞 vs 🌘 → no. 4-5: 🌘 vs 🌍 → no. 5-6: 🌍 vs 🦭 → no. 6-7: 🦭 vs 🌍 → no. 7-8: 🌍 vs 🌍 → same. So positions 7 and 8. Then position 8-9: 🌍 vs 🐞 → no. So here, a run of 2. So that's another horizontal line.\n\nThen row 2: 🦢🌍🐞🌵🦢🦑🌍🦏🦏🐦\n\nCheck consecutive. Let's see: positions 6-7: 🦏 vs 🦏 (positions 7 and 8 in the row). So positions 7 and 8 (original index 7 and 8) are same. So a run of 2. So another horizontal line here.\n\nRow 3: 🐦🌘🐞🐦🌵🌵🦑🌵🦢🦢\n\nCheck for runs. Position 4-5: 🌵🌵 → run of 2. Then positions 8-9: 🦢🦢 → run of 2. So two horizontal lines in this row.\n\nRow 4: 🦏🦏🦭🌘🐦🦏🦏🦢🌵🐞\n\nPositions 0-1: 🦏🦏 → run of 2. Then positions 5-6: 🦏🦏 → run of 2. So two lines here.\n\nRow 5: 🌘🌵🐦🌵🦭🦭🐞🦢🐦🦑\n\nLooking for runs. Positions 4-5: 🦭🦭 → run of 2. So one line here.\n\nRow 6: 🌍🦢🦢🌍🐦🌵🦑🌵🦏🌍\n\nCheck for runs. Positions 1-2: 🦢🦢 → run of 2. So one line here.\n\nRow 7: 🌘🌘🌵🐞🌍🐞🌍🌵🦑🐞\n\nFirst two positions: 🌘🌘 → run of 2. So one line here.\n\nRow 8: 🌘🦭🐦🌵🐞🦏🐞🌍🦭🦢\n\nCheck for consecutive same. Let's see: positions 0-1: 🌘 vs 🦭 → no. Next, positions 5-6: 🦏 vs 🐞 → no. Maybe no runs here. Hmm. Let's check each pair. The row is:\n\n🌘, 🦭, 🐦, 🌵, 🐞, 🦏, 🐞, 🌍, 🦭, 🦢. So no consecutive same emojis. So no horizontal lines here.\n\nRow 9: 🦭🦏🌍🐞🦏🐞🦑🦑🐞🦭\n\nCheck for runs. Positions 6-7: 🦑🦑 → run of 2. So one line here.\n\nSo the total horizontal lines count from rows: let's sum them up.\n\nRow 0: 1\n\nRow 1:1\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:2\n\nRow4:2\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:1\n\nRow7:1\n\nRow8:0\n\nRow9:1\n\nTotal horizontal: 1+1+1+2+2+1+1+1+0+1 = 11.\n\nNow for vertical lines. Need to check each column for consecutive same emojis in the same column. For each column, check down each row for consecutive runs.\n\nEach column is 10 rows. Let's go column by column.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRows 0: 🐦\n\nRow1: 🦢\n\nRow2: 🦢\n\nRow3: 🐦\n\nRow4: 🦏\n\nRow5: 🌘\n\nRow6: 🌍\n\nRow7: 🌘\n\nRow8: 🌘\n\nRow9: 🦭\n\nCheck consecutive in column 0.\n\nRow0 and row1: different. Row1 and row2: 🦢 and 🦢 → same. So a run of 2. But need to see if this continues. Let's look for consecutive runs in the column.\n\nLet me think: for vertical lines, each run in the column is a sequence of the same emoji in consecutive rows.\n\nSo for column 0:\n\nLooking down:\n\nRow0: 🐦\n\nRow1: 🦢 (different from row0)\n\nRow1 to row2: 🦢 → same. So a run of 2. Then row3 is 🐦 (different). So that's a run of 2 (rows1-2). Then row3 is different. So that's one vertical line here.\n\nRow4 is 🦏, different from row3. Row5 is 🌘, etc. So column0 has one vertical line (rows1-2).\n\nColumn1:\n\nRows0: 🌍\n\nRow1: 🌍\n\nRow2: 🌍\n\nRow3: 🌘\n\nRow4: 🦏\n\nRow5: 🌵\n\nRow6: 🦢\n\nRow7: 🌘\n\nRow8: 🦭\n\nRow9: 🦏\n\nLooking for consecutive same.\n\nRow0-1: 🌍 and 🌍 → same. Then row2 is also 🌍. So this is a run of 3 (rows0-2). So that's a vertical line of length 3. But since it's >=2, counts as one.\n\nThen row3 is 🌘 (different). So column1 has one vertical line (rows0-2).\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: 🌵\n\nRow1: 🦢\n\nRow2: 🐞\n\nRow3: 🐞 (from row3's data? Wait, original data for column2.\n\nWait, let's recheck the board. Let me list each row again.\n\nWait, the board is given as 10 rows, each with 10 emojis.\n\nLet me re-express the rows for easier column access.\n\nRow0: 0:🐦,1:🌍,2:🌵,3:🌍,4:🌘,5:🦭,6:🐞,7:🦑,8:🦑,9:🦢\n\nRow1: 0:🦢,1:🌍,2:🦢,3:🐞,4:🌘,5:🌍,6:🦭,7:🌍,8:🌍,9:🐞\n\nRow2: 0:🦢,1:🌍,2:🐞,3:🌵,4:🦢,5:🦑,6:🌍,7:🦏,8:🦏,9:🐦\n\nRow3: 0:🐦,1:🌘,2:🐞,3:🐦,4:🌵,5:🌵,6:🦑,7:🌵,8:🦢,9:🦢\n\nRow4:0:🦏,1:🦏,2:🦭,3:🌘,4:🐦,5:🦏,6:🦏,7:🦢,8:🌵,9:🐞\n\nRow5:0:🌘,1:🌵,2:🐦,3:🌵,4:🦭,5:🦭,6:🐞,7:🦢,8:🐦,9:🦑\n\nRow6:0:🌍,1:🦢,2:🦢,3:🌍,4:🐦,5:🌵,6:🦑,7:🌵,8:🦏,9:🌍\n\nRow7:0:🌘,1:🌘,2:🌵,3:🐞,4:🌍,5:🐞,6:🌍,7:🌵,8:🦑,9:🐞\n\nRow8:0:🌘,1:🦭,2:🐦,3:🌵,4:🐞,5:🦏,6:🐞,7:🌍,8:🦭,9:🦢\n\nRow9:0:🦭,1:🦏,2:🌍,3:🐞,4:🦏,5:🐞,6:🦑,7:🦑,8:🐞,9:🦭\n\nNow for column2 (third emoji in each row):\n\nRow0: 🌵 (column index 2)\n\nRow1: 🦢 (col2)\n\nRow2: 🐞 (col2)\n\nRow3: 🐞 (col2)\n\nRow4: 🦭 (col2)\n\nRow5: 🐦 (col2)\n\nRow6: 🦢 (col2)\n\nRow7: 🌵 (col2)\n\nRow8: 🐦 (col2)\n\nRow9: 🌍 (col2)\n\nLooking for vertical runs in column2.\n\nLooking from top to bottom:\n\nRow0: 🌵\n\nRow1: 🦢 → different. No run here.\n\nRow1: 🦢\n\nRow2: 🐞 → different.\n\nRow2: 🐞\n\nRow3: 🐞 → same. So rows2 and 3 have same emoji. That's a run of 2. Then row4 is 🦭 → different. So this run contributes one vertical line.\n\nAlso, check row3: 🐞. So rows2-3: same. So one line here.\n\nRow4: 🦭\n\nRow5: 🐦 → different.\n\nRow5: 🐦\n\nRow6: 🦢 → different.\n\nRow6: 🦢\n\nRow7: 🌵 → different.\n\nRow7: 🌵\n\nRow8: 🐦 → different.\n\nRow8: 🐦\n\nRow9: 🌍 → different. So in column2, the only vertical line is rows2-3: 🐞🐞 → count as one.\n\nSo column2 has one vertical line.\n\nProceeding column by column. This could take a while, but let's proceed.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🌍 (col3)\n\nRow1: 🐞 (col3)\n\nRow2: 🌵 (col3)\n\nRow3: 🐦 (col3)\n\nRow4: 🌘 (col4?)\n\nWait, let me check row4 column3. Row4 is: 🦏,🦏,🦭,🌘,🐦,🦏,🦏,🦢,🌵,🐞. So column3 is 🌘.\n\nWait, no. For column3 (fourth emoji in each row), let's list all:\n\nRow0: col3 is index3 → 🌍\n\nRow1: col3 → 🐞\n\nRow2: col3 → 🌵\n\nRow3: col3 → 🐦\n\nRow4: col3 → 🌘 (third item in row4's list?)\n\nWait, no. Let's recheck:\n\nRow4 is: 0:🦏,1:🦏,2:🦭,3:🌘,4:🐦,5:🦏,6:🦏,7:🦢,8:🌵,9:🐞. So column3 (index3) is 🌘.\n\nRow5 col3: index3 is 🌵 (row5's third is 🌵? Wait row5 is:0:🌘,1:🌵,2:🐦,3:🌵,4:🦭,5:🦭,6:🐞,7:🦢,8:🐦,9:🦑. So column3 is 🌵.\n\nRow6 col3: 🌍 (row6's index3 is 🌍)\n\nRow7 col3: 🐞 (row7's index3 is 🐞)\n\nRow8 col3: 🌵 (row8's index3 is 🌵)\n\nRow9 col3: 🐞 (row9's index3 is 🐞)\n\nSo column3:\n\nRow0: 🌍\n\nRow1: 🐞 → different. No run here.\n\nRow2: 🌵 → different.\n\nRow3: 🐦 → different.\n\nRow4: 🌘 → different.\n\nRow5: 🌵 → different.\n\nRow6: 🌍 → different.\n\nRow7: 🐞 → different.\n\nRow8: 🌵 → different.\n\nRow9: 🐞 → different. So no vertical lines in column3.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow0: 🌘 (col4)\n\nRow1: 🌘 (col4)\n\nRow2: 🦢 (col4)\n\nRow3: 🌵 (col4)\n\nRow4: 🐦 (col4)\n\nRow5: 🦭 (col4)\n\nRow6: 🐦 (col4)\n\nRow7: 🌍 (col4)\n\nRow8: 🐞 (col4)\n\nRow9: 🦏 (col4)\n\nCheck for vertical runs.\n\nRow0: 🌘 and row1: 🌘 → same. So a run of 2. Then row2: 🦢 → different. So that's a run of 2. So column4 has one vertical line here (rows0-1).\n\nRow2: 🦢, row3: 🌵 → different. Etc. So column4 has one.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow0: 🦭 (col5)\n\nRow1: 🌍 (col5)\n\nRow2: 🦑 (col5)\n\nRow3: 🌵 (col5)\n\nRow4: 🦏 (col5)\n\nRow5: 🦭 (col5)\n\nRow6: 🌵 (col5)\n\nRow7: 🐞 (col5)\n\nRow8: 🦏 (col5)\n\nRow9: 🐞 (col5)\n\nCheck vertical runs.\n\nLooking at row4: 🦏, row5: 🦭 → different. Row5 and row6: 🦭 and 🌵 → different. Hmm. Let's check all pairs.\n\nRow0-1: 🦭 vs 🌍 → no.\n\nRow1-2: 🌍 vs 🦑 → no.\n\nRow2-3: 🦑 vs 🌵 → no.\n\nRow3-4: 🌵 vs 🦏 → no.\n\nRow4-5: 🦏 vs 🦭 → no.\n\nRow5-6: 🦭 vs 🌵 → no.\n\nRow6-7: 🌵 vs 🐞 → no.\n\nRow7-8: 🐞 vs 🦏 → no.\n\nRow8-9: 🦏 vs 🐞 → no. So no vertical lines here.\n\nColumn5: no lines.\n\nColumn6:\n\nRow0: 🐞 (col6)\n\nRow1: 🦭 (col6)\n\nRow2: 🌍 (col6)\n\nRow3: 🦑 (col6)\n\nRow4: 🦏 (col6)\n\nRow5: 🐞 (col6)\n\nRow6: 🦑 (col6)\n\nRow7: 🌍 (col6)\n\nRow8: 🐞 (col6)\n\nRow9: 🦑 (col6)\n\nCheck for consecutive same.\n\nLooking for runs:\n\nRow0-1: 🐞 vs 🦭 → no.\n\nRow1-2: 🦭 vs 🌍 → no.\n\nRow2-3: 🌍 vs 🦑 → no.\n\nRow3-4: 🦑 vs 🦏 → no.\n\nRow4-5: 🦏 vs 🐞 → no.\n\nRow5-6: 🐞 vs 🦑 → no.\n\nRow6-7: 🦑 vs 🌍 → no.\n\nRow7-8: 🌍 vs 🐞 → no.\n\nRow8-9: 🐞 vs 🦑 → no. So column6: no lines.\n\nColumn7:\n\nRow0: 🦑 (col7)\n\nRow1: 🌍 (col7)\n\nRow2: 🦏 (col7)\n\nRow3: 🌵 (col7)\n\nRow4: 🦢 (col7)\n\nRow5: 🦢 (col7)\n\nRow6: 🌵 (col7)\n\nRow7: 🌵 (col7)\n\nRow8: 🌍 (col7)\n\nRow9: 🦑 (col7)\n\nLooking for consecutive same.\n\nRow4: 🦢, row5: 🦢 → same. So a run of 2 (rows4-5). Then row6: 🌵 → different. So that's one line here.\n\nAlso, row7: 🌵 and row6: 🌵 → same? Wait, row6's col7 is 🌵. Row7's col7 is 🌵? Let's see:\n\nRow6: 🦑, 🌵 (positions 6 and 7 in the row?), no. Wait row6's column7 is the 8th element (index7). Let me check row6 again. Row6 is: 🌍, 🦢, 🦢, 🌍, 🐦, 🌵, 🦑, 🌵, 🦏, 🌍. So column7 is 🌵. Row7's column7 is 🌵 (row7: ...🌍, 🌵). So row6's column7 is 🌵, row7's column7 is 🌵. So rows6-7: 🌵🌵 → same. Then row8's column7 is 🌍 → different. So a run of 2 here. So that's another vertical line (rows6-7).\n\nSo column7 has two vertical lines: rows4-5 (🦢🦢) and rows6-7 (🌵🌵)?\n\nWait, no. Wait, in column7:\n\nRow0: 🦑 (7)\n\nRow1: 🌍 (7)\n\nRow2: 🦏 (7)\n\nRow3: 🌵 (7)\n\nRow4: 🦢 (7)\n\nRow5: 🦢 (7)\n\nRow6: 🌵 (7)\n\nRow7: 🌵 (7)\n\nRow8: 🌍 (7)\n\nRow9: 🦑 (7)\n\nSo check each pair:\n\nrow4 and row5: 🦢 and 🦢 → same. So a run of 2. Then row5 and row6: 🦢 vs 🌵 → different. So that's one line (rows4-5).\n\nThen row6 and row7: 🌵 and 🌵 → same. So a run of 2 (rows6-7). So two vertical lines in column7.\n\nSo column7 contributes two.\n\nColumn8:\n\nRow0: 🦑 (col8)\n\nRow1: 🌍 (col8)\n\nRow2: 🦏 (col8)\n\nRow3: 🦢 (col8)\n\nRow4: 🌵 (col8)\n\nRow5: 🐦 (col8)\n\nRow6: 🦏 (col8)\n\nRow7: 🦑 (col8)\n\nRow8: 🦭 (col8)\n\nRow9: 🐞 (col8)\n\nCheck consecutive pairs.\n\nNo consecutive same here. For example:\n\nrow0: 🦑, row1: 🌍 → different.\n\nrow2: 🦏, row3: 🦢 → different. Etc. No vertical lines here.\n\nColumn9:\n\nRow0: 🦢 (col9)\n\nRow1: 🐞 (col9)\n\nRow2: 🐦 (col9)\n\nRow3: 🦢 (col9)\n\nRow4: 🐞 (col9)\n\nRow5: 🦑 (col9)\n\nRow6: 🌍 (col9)\n\nRow7: 🐞 (col9)\n\nRow8: 🦢 (col9)\n\nRow9: 🦭 (col9)\n\nCheck for consecutive same.\n\nLooking for pairs:\n\nRow0: 🦢, row1: 🐞 → no.\n\nRow3: 🦢, row4: 🐞 → no.\n\nRow8: 🦢, row9: 🦭 → no. No vertical lines here.\n\nNow, let's process each column and count the vertical lines.\n\nColumn0: 1\n\nColumn1:1 (rows0-2, three in a row but counts as one)\n\nColumn2:1 (rows2-3)\n\nColumn3:0\n\nColumn4:1 (rows0-1)\n\nColumn5:0\n\nColumn6:0\n\nColumn7:2 (rows4-5 and 6-7)\n\nColumn8:0\n\nColumn9:0\n\nSo total vertical lines: 1+1+1+0+1+0+0+2+0+0= 6?\n\nWait, let's recount:\n\nColumn0: 1\n\nColumn1:1\n\nColumn2:1\n\nColumn3:0\n\nColumn4:1\n\nColumn5:0\n\nColumn6:0\n\nColumn7:2\n\nColumns8:0\n\nColumn9:0\n\nSum: 1+1=2, +1=3, +0=3, +1=4, then 0,0,2 → 4+2=6. So 6 vertical lines.\n\nSo total vertical lines is 6.\n\nNow total lines (horizontal+vertical) is 11+6=17. Wait, but wait—did I count all vertical lines correctly?\n\nLet me double-check some columns.\n\nColumn1: rows0,1,2: 🌍,🌍,🌍. So this is a run of 3. So that's one vertical line here. Correct.\n\nColumn7: two lines? rows4-5 (🦢) and rows6-7 (🌵). Yes, correct.\n\nWhat about column4: rows0-1 (🌘🌘) → 1 line. Correct.\n\nColumn2: rows2-3: 🐞🐞 → 1 line.\n\nColumn0: rows1-2: 🦢🦢 → 1 line.\n\nSo vertical sum is 6.\n\nSo total is 11 horizontal + 6 vertical = 17.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me recheck the vertical columns again.\n\nAnother way: let's list each column and count the vertical lines.\n\nColumn0: checks runs.\n\nRows: 0:🐦, 1:🦢, 2:🦢,3:🐦,4:🦏,5:🌘,6:🌍,7:🌘,8:🌘,9:🦭.\n\nLooking for consecutive same.\n\n1-2: 🦢-🦢 → run of 2. So that's one.\n\nAre there any others? 7-8: 🌘-🌘 → yes. So rows7 and 8: same. So that's another run of 2. So column0 has two vertical lines.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake here. Earlier, I thought column0 had one line (rows1-2), but now I see that rows7-8 are also 🌘 and 🌘. Oh right! So in column0:\n\nRow7: 🌘 (from row7's first emoji)\n\nRow8: 🌘 (row8's first emoji)\n\nSo rows7-8: same emoji. That's a run of 2. So column0 has two vertical lines.\n\nOh no! That's a mistake. So in column0, there are two vertical lines: rows1-2 (🦢🦢) and rows7-8 (🌘🌘).\n\nSo column0 contributes 2 instead of 1. That changes the count.\n\nHmm, this shows that my initial approach of checking each column might have errors. Let me recheck.\n\nAh, yes! For column0:\n\nLooking at each pair:\n\nRow0-1: 🐦 vs 🦢 → different.\n\nRow1-2: 🦢 vs 🦢 → same → start of a run. Run continues? Row2-3: 🦢 vs 🐦 → different. So the run is rows1-2 → one line.\n\nRow3-4: 🐦 vs 🦏 → different.\n\nRow4-5: 🦏 vs 🌘 → different.\n\nRow5-6: 🌘 vs 🌍 → different.\n\nRow6-7: 🌍 vs 🌘 → different.\n\nRow7-8: 🌘 vs 🌘 → same → run of 2. So that's another line.\n\nRow8-9: 🌘 vs 🦭 → different.\n\nSo column0 has two vertical lines.\n\nAh, so my initial count for column0 was wrong. That's a mistake. So that changes the vertical count.\n\nSimilarly, other columns might have additional lines I missed.\n\nThis highlights the need to be very careful.\n\nSo let's redo the vertical count correctly.\n\nLet's process each column properly.\n\nStarting with column0:\n\nRow0: 🐦\n\nRow1: 🦢\n\nRow2: 🦢\n\nRow3: 🐦\n\nRow4: 🦏\n\nRow5: 🌘\n\nRow6: 🌍\n\nRow7: 🌘\n\nRow8: 🌘\n\nRow9: 🦭\n\nCheck each consecutive pair:\n\nRow1-2: same (🦢) → run of 2. So one line.\n\nRow7-8: same (🌘) → another line. So column0 has two vertical lines.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow0: 🌍\n\nRow1: 🌍\n\nRow2: 🌍\n\nRow3: 🌘\n\nRow4: 🦏\n\nRow5: 🌵\n\nRow6: 🦢\n\nRow7: 🌘\n\nRow8: 🦭\n\nRow9: 🦏\n\nCheck consecutive pairs.\n\nRow0-1: same (🌍) → run of 2. Then row2 is also 🌍, so run continues. So the run here is rows0-2 (3 in a row). But this counts as one vertical line. So one line here.\n\nOther pairs:\n\nRow3-4: 🌘 vs 🦏 → no.\n\nRow7-8: 🌘 vs 🦭 → no.\n\nSo column1 has one line.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: 🌵\n\nRow1: 🦢\n\nRow2: 🐞\n\nRow3: 🐞\n\nRow4: 🦭\n\nRow5: 🐦\n\nRow6: 🦢\n\nRow7: 🌵\n\nRow8: 🐦\n\nRow9: 🌍\n\nConsecutive pairs:\n\nRow2-3: 🐞🐞 → same. So one line here.\n\nNo others.\n\nSo column2:1 line.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🌍\n\nRow1: 🐞\n\nRow2: 🌵\n\nRow3: 🐦\n\nRow4: 🌘\n\nRow5: 🌵\n\nRow6: 🌍\n\nRow7: 🐞\n\nRow8: 🌵\n\nRow9: 🐞\n\nNo consecutive same pairs. So column3: 0.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow0: 🌘\n\nRow1: 🌘\n\nRow2: 🦢\n\nRow3: 🌵\n\nRow4: 🐦\n\nRow5: 🦭\n\nRow6: 🐦\n\nRow7: 🌍\n\nRow8: 🐞\n\nRow9: 🦏\n\nCheck pairs:\n\nRow0-1: 🌘🌘 → same. So one line here.\n\nNo others. So column4:1 line.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow0: 🦭\n\nRow1: 🌍\n\nRow2: 🦑\n\nRow3: 🌵\n\nRow4: 🦏\n\nRow5: 🦭\n\nRow6: 🌵\n\nRow7: 🐞\n\nRow8: 🦏\n\nRow9: 🐞\n\nNo consecutive pairs. So 0.\n\nColumn6:\n\nRow0: 🐞\n\nRow1: 🦭\n\nRow2: 🌍\n\nRow3: 🦑\n\nRow4: 🦏\n\nRow5: 🐞\n\nRow6: 🦑\n\nRow7: 🌍\n\nRow8: 🐞\n\nRow9: 🦑\n\nNo consecutive pairs. So 0.\n\nColumn7:\n\nRow0: 🦑\n\nRow1: 🌍\n\nRow2: 🦏\n\nRow3: 🌵\n\nRow4: 🦢\n\nRow5: 🦢\n\nRow6: 🌵\n\nRow7: 🌵\n\nRow8: 🌍\n\nRow9: 🦑\n\nCheck pairs:\n\nRow4-5: 🦢🦢 → same. So one line.\n\nRow6-7: 🌵🌵 → same. Another line.\n\nSo column7: 2 lines.\n\nColumn8:\n\nRow0: 🦑\n\nRow1: 🌍\n\nRow2: 🦏\n\nRow3: 🦢\n\nRow4: 🌵\n\nRow5: 🐦\n\nRow6: 🦏\n\nRow7: 🦑\n\nRow8: 🦭\n\nRow9: 🐞\n\nNo consecutive pairs. 0.\n\nColumn9:\n\nRow0: 🦢\n\nRow1: 🐞\n\nRow2: 🐦\n\nRow3: 🦢\n\nRow4: 🐞\n\nRow5: 🦑\n\nRow6: 🌍\n\nRow7: 🐞\n\nRow8: 🦢\n\nRow9: 🦭\n\nNo consecutive pairs. 0.\n\nNow summing vertical lines:\n\nColumn0:2\n\nColumn1:1\n\nColumn2:1\n\nColumn3:0\n\nColumn4:1\n\nColumn5:0\n\nColumn6:0\n\nColumn7:2\n\nColumn8:0\n\nColumn9:0\n\nTotal vertical: 2+1+1+0+1+0+0+2+0+0=7.\n\nSo vertical lines total 7.\n\nBut earlier I thought column0 had two lines, making vertical total 7. Then what about horizontal count?\n\nEarlier horizontal count was 11, but maybe there's a mistake there as well.\n\nSo let's recheck the horizontal count.\n\nRow0: 🐦🌍🌵🌍🌘🦭🐞🦑🦑🦢 → the run is 🦑🦑 (positions 7-8). So one line.\n\nRow1: 🦢🌍🦢🐞🌘🌍🦭🌍🌍🐞 → run is 🌍🌍 (positions 7-8). So one line.\n\nRow2: 🦢🌍🐞🌵🦢🦑🌍🦏🦏🐦 → run is 🦏🦏 (positions7-8). One line.\n\nRow3: 🐦🌘🐞🐦🌵🌵🦑🌵🦢🦢 → two runs: 🌵🌵 (4-5) and 🦢🦢 (8-9). So two lines.\n\nRow4: 🦏🦏🦭🌘🐦🦏🦏🦢🌵🐞 → runs at 0-1 and 5-6. So two lines.\n\nRow5: 🌘🌵🐦🌵🦭🦭🐞🦢🐦🦑 → run at 4-5. One line.\n\nRow6: 🌍🦢🦢🌍🐦🌵🦑🌵🦏🌍 → run at 1-2 (🦢🦢). One line.\n\nRow7: 🌘🌘🌵🐞🌍🐞🌍🌵🦑🐞 → run at 0-1 (🌘🌘). One line.\n\nRow8: 🌘🦭🐦🌵🐞🦏🐞🌍🦭🦢 → no runs. Zero.\n\nRow9: 🦭🦏🌍🐞🦏🐞🦑🦑🐞🦭 → run at 6-7 (🦑🦑). One line.\n\nSo horizontal lines: 1+1+1+2+2+1+1+1+0+1=12?\n\nWait, wait. Let's recount:\n\nRow0:1\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:2 → total 5 so far.\n\nRow4:2 → 7.\n\nRow5:1 →8.\n\nRow6:1 →9.\n\nRow7:1 →10.\n\nRow8:0 →10.\n\nRow9:1 →11.\n\nSo 11 horizontal lines. But according to this, it's 11. But previously I thought that row4's runs are at 0-1 and 5-6. Let's check row4's data.\n\nRow4: 🦏, 🦏, 🦭, 🌘, 🐦, 🦏, 🦏, 🦢, 🌵, 🐞.\n\nSo positions0-1: 🦏🦏 → run of 2. Positions5-6: 🦏🦏 → another run of 2. So that's two runs. So yes, row4 has two lines.\n\nSo the horizontal count is 11. Then vertical is 7.\n\nTotal lines:11 +7=18.\n\nBut wait, in the vertical recheck, the total vertical lines are 7. So answer is 18.\n\nBut let's confirm once again.\n\nColumn0: two vertical lines (rows1-2 and rows7-8).\n\nColumn1: one (rows0-2, but count as one line).\n\nColumn2: one (rows2-3).\n\nColumn4: one (rows0-1).\n\nColumn7: two (rows4-5 and rows6-7).\n\nSo vertical total: 2+1+1+1+2=7.\n\nSo horizontal is 11, vertical is7. Total 18.\n\nBut earlier when I thought vertical was 7, and horizontal 11, sum is 18.\n\nSo the correct answer is 18?\n\n\nThe task is to count horizontal and vertical lines of the same emoji with length ≥2. \n\n**Horizontal Lines:**\n- **Row 0:** 🦑🦑 (positions 7-8) → 1 line.\n- **Row 1:** 🌍🌍 (positions 7-8) → 1 line.\n- **Row 2:** 🦏🦏 (positions 7-8) → 1 line.\n- **Row 3:** 🌵🌵 (positions 4-5) and 🦢🦢 (positions 8-9) → 2 lines.\n- **Row 4:** 🦏🦏 (positions 0-1) and 🦏🦏 (positions 5-6) → 2 lines.\n- **Row 5:** 🦭🦭 (positions 4-5) → 1 line.\n- **Row 6:** 🦢🦢 (positions 1-2) → 1 line.\n- **Row 7:** 🌘🌘 (positions 0-1) → 1 line.\n- **Row 9:** 🦑🦑 (positions 6-7) → 1 line.\n  \n**Total Horizontal Lines = 11.**\n\n**Vertical Lines:**\n- **Column 0:** 🦢🦢 (rows 1-2) and 🌘🌘 (rows 7-8) → 2 lines.\n- **Column 1:** 🌍🌍🌍 (rows 0-2) → 1 line.\n- **Column 2:** 🐞🐞 (rows 2-3) → 1 line.\n- **Column 4:** 🌘🌘 (rows 0-1) → 1 line.\n- **Column 7:** 🦢🦢 (rows 4-5) and 🌵🌵 (rows 6-7) → 2 lines.\n  \n**Total Vertical Lines = 7.**\n\n**Total Lines = 11 (Horizontal) + 7 (Vertical) = 18.**\n\nAnswer: 18"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

So, we have a board made up of emojis, and we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of two or more. Hmm, lines of length two count as one, but longer lines might contribute more than one? Wait, no. Wait, the question says lines of length 2 or more. So a line of length 3 counts as one line. Because it's a single line. But wait, maybe not. Because sometimes in such problems, a line of three in a row can be considered as two overlapping lines (like positions 1-2 and 2-3). But in the problem statement, it's probably considering each contiguous sequence as a single line. So for example, a horizontal sequence of three same emojis in a row would count as one line. Similarly for vertical. So the task is to check every possible horizontal and vertical line, and count how many sequences of same emojis with length >=2 there are.\n\nSo the board is 7x7, as each row has 7 emojis. Let me see:\n\nThe board has 7 rows. Let's look at the given board row by row.\n\nRow 1: 🐅🐅🐳🐅🐅🌼🐑\nRow 2: 🐅🌼🐑🐫🐫🐅🐨\nRow 3: 🐅🌲🌼🐑🐫🌲🌲\nRow 4: 🐑🐑🐫🐳🐅🐨🐳\nRow 5: 🌲🐫🐅🐅🌲🌼🌼\nRow 6: 🌼🐑🐫🌼🐅🐳🐅\nRow 7: 🐅🐑🌼🌼🐑🐳🐫\n\nFirst, process horizontal lines. For each row, check consecutive emojis. For each group of same emojis in a row, count how many sequences of 2 or longer. For example, in row 1, the first two are 🐅. Then a 🐳. Then two 🐅 again. Then 🌼 and 🐑. So in row 1, there are two horizontal lines: the first two 🐅, then the two 🐅 later. Each of these is a line of length 2, so they each count as 1. So row 1 contributes 2 horizontal lines.\n\nThen do the same for each row. Then process vertical lines by checking each column. For each column, check consecutive same emojis vertically.\n\nLet me start by processing each row horizontally.\n\nRow 1: 🐅🐅🐳🐅🐅🌼🐑\nLooking for sequences of same emoji. Let's list them:\n\nPositions 0-1: 🐅 (length 2)\nThen position 2: 🐳 (length 1)\nPositions 3-4: 🐅 (length 2)\nThen positions 5: 🌼, 6: 🐑 (each length 1)\nSo horizontal in row 1: 2 lines.\n\nRow 2: 🐅🌼🐑🐫🐫🐅🐨\nEmojis: positions 0: 🐅 (1)\n1: 🌼 (1)\n2: 🐑 (1)\n3-4: 🐫 (length 2)\n5: 🐅, 6: 🐨 (each 1)\nSo in row 2, there's one horizontal line (🐫🐫). So contributes 1.\n\nRow3: 🐅🌲🌼🐑🐫🌲🌲\nSequences: position0: 🐅 (1)\n1: 🌲 (1)\n2: 🌼 (1)\n3: 🐑 (1)\n4: 🐫 (1)\n5-6: 🌲 (length 2). So contributes 1.\n\nRow4: 🐑🐑🐫🐳🐅🐨🐳\nCheck:\npositions0-1: 🐑 (2) → count 1\npos2: 🐫 (1)\npos3: 🐳 (1)\npos4: 🐅 (1)\npos5: 🐨 (1)\npos6: 🐳 (1)\nSo row4 contributes 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow5: 🌲🐫🐅🐅🌲🌼🌼\nCheck sequences:\n0: 🌲 (1)\n1: 🐫 (1)\n2-3: 🐅 (2 → count 1)\n4: 🌲 (1)\n5-6: 🌼 (2 → count 1)\nSo row5 has two horizontal lines.\n\nRow6: 🌼🐑🐫🌼🐅🐳🐅\nCheck:\n0: 🌼 (1)\n1: 🐑 (1)\n2: 🐫 (1)\n3: 🌼 (1)\n4: 🐅 (1)\n5: 🐳 (1)\n6: 🐅 (1)\nAll single, no sequences of length 2. So row6 contributes 0.\n\nRow7: 🐅🐑🌼🌼🐑🐳🐫\nCheck:\n0: 🐅 (1)\n1: 🐑 (1)\n2-3: 🌼 (2 → count 1)\n4: 🐑 (1)\n5: 🐳 (1)\n6: 🐫 (1)\nSo row7 contributes 1.\n\nSo horizontal lines total: 2+1+1+1+2+0+1 = 8.\n\nNow vertical lines. Columns are 0 to 6. Each column has 7 rows.\n\nLet's process each column:\n\nColumn 0:\nRows 1-7, column0:\n\nRow1: 🐅\nRow2: 🐅\nRow3: 🐅\nRow4: 🐑\nRow5: 🌲\nRow6: 🌼\nRow7: 🐅\n\nLooking for vertical sequences. Let's list the emojis in order for column0:\n\nRow1: 🐅, row2: 🐅, row3: 🐅, row4: 🐑, row5: 🌲, row6: 🌼, row7: 🐅.\n\nCheck consecutive same. So rows 1-3 are 🐅🐅🐅. That's a sequence of 3. So that's one vertical line (since it's a single line of length >=2). Then after that, row4 is 🐑 (different), etc. So in column0, the first three rows form a vertical line of length 3. So that's 1.\n\nColumn0 contributes 1.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow1: 🐅 (row1)\nRow2: 🌼 (row2)\nRow3: 🌲 (row3)\nRow4: 🐑 (row4)\nRow5: 🐫 (row5)\nRow6: 🐑 (row6)\nRow7: 🐑 (row7)\n\nSo column1:\n\nRows:\n0: 🐅 (assuming rows are 0-indexed here? Wait, original data is given as 7 rows. Let's clarify: when the user lists the board, row 1 is the first line. So row1 is index 0 in code. But for our manual checking, let's index rows as 0 to 6 (since there are 7 rows).\n\nWait, the given data has 7 rows. Let me recheck:\n\nRow indexes 0 to 6:\n\nRow0: 🐅🐅🐳🐅🐅🌼🐑\nRow1: 🐅🌼🐑🐫🐫🐅🐨\nRow2: 🐅🌲🌼🐑🐫🌲🌲\nRow3: 🐑🐑🐫🐳🐅🐨🐳\nRow4: 🌲🐫🐅🐅🌲🌼🌼\nRow5: 🌼🐑🐫🌼🐅🐳🐅\nRow6: 🐅🐑🌼🌼🐑🐳🐫\n\nSo columns are 0-6, each column has rows 0-6.\n\nSo column1 (second column) entries:\n\nRow0: 🐅 (position1)\nRow1: 🌼 (position1)\nRow2: 🌲 (position1)\nRow3: 🐑 (position1)\nRow4: 🐫 (position1)\nRow5: 🐑 (position1)\nRow6: 🐑 (position1)\n\nSo looking for vertical sequences. Let's list them:\n\nRow0: 🐅\nRow1: 🌼 (different)\nSo row0 is a single.\n\nRow1: 🌼\nRow2: 🌲 (different)\nRow1 is single.\n\nRow2: 🌲\nRow3: 🐑 (different)\nRow2 is single.\n\nRow3: 🐑\nRow4: 🐫 (different)\nSingle.\n\nRow4: 🐫\nRow5: 🐑 (different)\nSingle.\n\nRow5: 🐑\nRow6: 🐑 (same)\nSo rows5 and 6: 🐑🐑 (length 2). That's a vertical line. So column1 contributes 1.\n\nSo column1 has one vertical line (rows5-6).\n\nColumn2:\n\nEntries:\n\nRow0: 🐳 (position2)\nRow1: 🐑 (position2)\nRow2: 🌼 (position2)\nRow3: 🐫 (position2)\nRow4: 🐅 (position2)\nRow5: 🐫 (position2)\nRow6: 🌼 (position2)\n\nCheck vertical sequences. Let's see:\n\nRow0: 🐳\nRow1: 🐑 → different. So row0 is single.\n\nRow1: 🐑\nRow2: 🌼 → different. Single.\n\nRow2: 🌼\nRow3: 🐫 → different.\n\nRow3: 🐫\nRow4: 🐅 → different.\n\nRow4: 🐅\nRow5: 🐫 → different.\n\nRow5: 🐫\nRow6: 🌼 → different.\n\nSo no vertical sequences in column2. So contributes 0.\n\nColumn3:\n\nEntries:\n\nRow0: 🐅 (position3)\nRow1: 🐫 (position3)\nRow2: 🐑 (position3)\nRow3: 🐳 (position3)\nRow4: 🐅 (position3)\nRow5: 🌼 (position3)\nRow6: 🌼 (position3)\n\nCheck vertical sequences.\n\nRow0: 🐅\nRow1: 🐫 → different. So row0 is single.\n\nRow1: 🐫\nRow2: 🐑 → different.\n\nRow2: 🐑\nRow3: 🐳 → different.\n\nRow3: 🐳\nRow4: 🐅 → different.\n\nRow4: 🐅\nRow5: 🌼 → different.\n\nRow5: 🌼\nRow6: 🌼 → same. So rows5-6: 🌼🌼 (length 2). So vertical line. Contributes 1.\n\nSo column3 contributes 1.\n\nColumn4:\n\nEntries:\n\nRow0: 🐅 (position4)\nRow1: 🐫 (position4)\nRow2: 🐫 (position4)\nRow3: 🐅 (position4)\nRow4: 🌲 (position4)\nRow5: 🐅 (position4)\nRow6: 🐑 (position4)\n\nCheck vertical sequences.\n\nLooking for consecutive same:\n\nRow0: 🐅\nRow1: 🐫 → different. So no.\n\nRow1: 🐫\nRow2: 🐫 → same. So rows1-2: 🐫🐫 (length 2). That's one.\n\nThen row2: 🐫, row3: 🐅 → different.\n\nRow3: 🐅\nRow4: 🌲 → different.\n\nRow4: 🌲\nRow5: 🐅 → different.\n\nRow5: 🐅\nRow6: 🐑 → different.\n\nSo column4 has one vertical line (rows1-2).\n\nColumn5:\n\nEntries:\n\nRow0: 🌼 (position5)\nRow1: 🐅 (position5)\nRow2: 🌲 (position5)\nRow3: 🐨 (position5)\nRow4: 🌼 (position5)\nRow5: 🐳 (position5)\nRow6: 🐳 (position5)\n\nCheck vertical sequences.\n\nRow0: 🌼\nRow1: 🐅 → different. So no.\n\nRow1: 🐅\nRow2: 🌲 → different.\n\nRow2: 🌲\nRow3: 🐨 → different.\n\nRow3: 🐨\nRow4: 🌼 → different.\n\nRow4: 🌼\nRow5: 🐳 → different.\n\nRow5: 🐳\nRow6: 🐳 → same. So rows5-6: 🐳🐳 (length 2). That's one.\n\nSo column5 contributes 1.\n\nColumn6:\n\nEntries:\n\nRow0: 🐑 (position6)\nRow1: 🐨 (position6)\nRow2: 🌲 (position6)\nRow3: 🐳 (position6)\nRow4: 🌼 (position6)\nRow5: 🐅 (position6)\nRow6: 🐫 (position6)\n\nCheck vertical sequences. All are different. So no vertical lines here.\n\nSo summing up vertical lines:\n\nColumn0: 1\n\nColumn1:1\n\nColumn3:1\n\nColumn4:1\n\nColumn5:1\n\nTotal vertical: 5.\n\nWait, let me recount each column's contributions:\n\nColumn0: 1\n\nColumn1:1 (rows5-6)\n\nColumn2:0\n\nColumn3:1 (rows5-6)\n\nColumn4:1 (rows1-2)\n\nColumn5:1 (rows5-6)\n\nColumn6:0\n\nTotal vertical lines: 1+1+1+1+1=5?\n\nWait, columns 0:1, 1:1, 3:1,4:1,5:1 → that's 5. Correct.\n\nSo vertical lines total 5.\n\nNow, combining horizontal and vertical counts.\n\nHorizontal lines: 8 (from rows0-6's horizontal contributions)\n\nVertical lines: 5.\n\nTotal lines: 8+5=13.\n\nWait, but let me recheck the horizontal count to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nHorizontal line counts per row:\n\nRow0: 2\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:2\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:1\n\nTotal: 2+1=3, +1=4, +1=5, +2=7, +0=7, +1=8. Yes.\n\nVertical lines: 5.\n\nSo total is 13?\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miss any vertical line.\n\nRecheck column0:\n\nRows0-2: 🐅, 🐅, 🐅. So a vertical line of length 3 → counts as 1.\n\nYes.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRows5 and 6 (🐑, 🐑) → counts as 1.\n\nYes.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRows5 and 6 (🌼, 🌼) → counts as 1. Yes.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRows1 and 2 (🐫, 🐫) → counts as 1.\n\nYes.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRows5 and 6 (🐳, 🐳) → counts as 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo vertical lines total 5.\n\nSo 8+5=13. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the horizontal count.\n\nLet me double-check each row's horizontal lines:\n\nRow0 (first line):\n\n🐅🐅🐳🐅🐅🌼🐑\n\nGroups: two 🐅 (count 1), then 🐳 (no), two 🐅 (count 1), then single. So total 2. Correct.\n\nRow1 (second line):\n\n🐅🌼🐑🐫🐫🐅🐨\n\nGroups: 🐫🐫 (count 1). Correct.\n\nRow2 (third line):\n\n🐅🌲🌼🐑🐫🌲🌲\n\nGroups: 🌲🌲 (count 1). Correct.\n\nRow3 (fourth line):\n\n🐑🐑🐫🐳🐅🐨🐳\n\nGroups: 🐑🐑 (count 1). Correct.\n\nRow4 (fifth line):\n\n🌲🐫🐅🐅🌲🌼🌼\n\nGroups: 🐅🐅 (count 1), 🌼🌼 (count 1). Total 2. Correct.\n\nRow5 (sixth line):\n\n🌼🐑🐫🌼🐅🐳🐅\n\nNo groups of two. Correct.\n\nRow6 (seventh line):\n\n🐅🐑🌼🌼🐑🐳🐫\n\nGroups: 🌼🌼 (count 1). Correct.\n\nYes, horizontal lines total 8.\n\nVertical lines 5. Total 13.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in the vertical lines. Let me check column3 again.\n\nColumn3 entries:\n\nRow0: 🐅\n\nRow1: 🐫\n\nRow2: 🐑\n\nRow3: 🐳\n\nRow4: 🐅\n\nRow5: 🌼\n\nRow6: 🌼\n\nSo the last two rows (5 and 6) in column3 are 🌼 and 🌼. So that's a vertical line of length 2. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, column5's rows5 and 6 are 🐳 and 🐳. Correct.\n\nSo 5 vertical lines.\n\nSo 8 +5 =13. So the answer is 13.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I missed some vertical lines.\n\nFor example, column0 has three 🐅 in a row. That's a vertical line of length 3. Which counts as 1. Correct.\n\nWhat about column6? Let's recheck:\n\nRow6 entries for column6 are:\n\nRow0: 🐑 (position6)\nRow1: 🐨 (position6)\nRow2: 🌲 (position6)\nRow3: 🐳 (position6)\nRow4: 🌼 (position6)\nRow5: 🐅 (position6)\nRow6: 🐫 (position6)\n\nAll different. So no.\n\nAnother possible mistake: in column5, rows5-6 are 🐳🐳. So counts as one.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the total is 13.\n\nHmm. Let me think again.\n\nWait, but in vertical lines, perhaps I missed a longer sequence.\n\nFor example, in column0, three consecutive 🐅. That's a single line of length 3, which is counted once, not three times (for positions 0-1, 1-2, 0-1-2). Because the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So a line of three is considered as a single line, not multiple overlapping ones.\n\nSo correct, that's counted once.\n\nSo yes, vertical lines are 5.\n\nSo total lines:13.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the vertical lines for column0. Let me check column0 again.\n\nColumn0 entries:\n\nRow0: 🐅\n\nRow1: 🐅\n\nRow2: 🐅\n\nRow3: 🐑\n\nRow4: 🌲\n\nRow5: 🌼\n\nRow6: 🐅\n\nSo rows0-2 are 🐅, 🐅, 🐅. So three in a row. That's a vertical line of length 3. Counts as one.\n\nThen rows3 is 🐑, different.\n\nRow4: 🌲, different.\n\nRow5: 🌼, different.\n\nRow6: 🐅, different from row5.\n\nSo yes, only one vertical line in column0.\n\nSimilarly, other columns have their vertical lines counted correctly.\n\nSo the total is indeed 13.\n\n\nAnswer: 13"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

So, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more. The lines can be part of a longer line, but each segment of 2+ counts. Wait, but how exactly do they count? Like, if there's a row of 3 same emojis, that's one line of length 3. But the problem says lines of length 2 or more. So in that case, a line of 3 would contribute two lines (the first two and the last two, but maybe overlapping counts as separate?) Wait, no. Wait, the problem statement might be a bit ambiguous here. But from the way the question is phrased, perhaps each possible consecutive sequence of 2 or more in a row counts as a separate line. Wait, no. Wait, I think the standard way these problems are phrased is that any consecutive sequence of length 2 or more in a straight line (horizontal or vertical) counts as a single line. So for example, a horizontal row like 🐼🐼🐼 would count as one line of length 3. Or does each possible sub-line of length 2 count? Hmm. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\nThe task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more. So I think each maximal line (the longest possible consecutive same emojis) counts as one. Wait, but sometimes a longer line may have multiple possible segments. For example, a line of 4 same emojis would have 3 possible segments of 2, but I think the problem wants each maximal line. Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's see the example. Suppose a row is 🐿🐿🐿. Then, in horizontal direction, this is a single line of length 3. So how many lines of length >=2 does that contribute? The problem says lines of length 2 or more. So the entire length is 3, so that's one line. But if the problem counts each possible consecutive run of 2 or more, even overlapping ones, then a 3-length line would contribute two lines (positions 1-2 and 2-3). But that's probably not the case. The standard approach here is to count each maximal line, not overlapping segments. So a sequence of 3 same emojis in a row counts as 1 line. Because otherwise, if you have a row of 5 same emojis, you'd have 4 lines of length 2, 3 of length 3, etc., but that's probably not what the problem expects. The problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So each line is a contiguous sequence of the same emoji, either horizontal or vertical, with length >=2. Each such sequence counts once. So for example, if a horizontal row is 🐿🐿🐼🐼🐼, then there are two horizontal lines here: the first two 🐿 and the next three 🐼. So each maximal consecutive same emojis in a line. So I think that's the correct approach.\n\nSo the plan is: check each row for horizontal lines (each group of consecutive same emojis, length >=2) and each column for vertical lines (same). Then sum all those.\n\nLet me look at the given board:\n\nThe board is a 6x6 grid. Let's parse it row by row.\n\nRow 1: 🐿🐿🐼🐼🐼🚀\nBreaking into consecutive groups:\n- 🐿🐿 (length 2)\n- 🐼🐼🐼 (length 3)\n- 🚀 (length 1)\nSo two horizontal lines here.\n\nRow 2: 🐼🐼🐿🚀🚀🐼\nConsecutive groups:\n- 🐼🐼 (2)\n- 🐿 (1)\n- 🚀🚀 (2)\n- 🐼 (1)\nSo two horizontal lines here.\n\nRow3: ✨✨🚀🐿✨✨\nGroups:\n- ✨✨ (2)\n- 🚀 (1)\n- 🐿 (1)\n- ✨✨ (2)\nSo two horizontal lines here. Wait, but the line from position 4 is 🐿, then positions 5-6 are ✨✨. So the first two are ✨✨, then after that comes 🚀, then 🐿, then two ✨. So total two lines here? Wait, the groups are:\n✨✨ (counts as 1 line), then 🚀, then 🐿, then ✨✨ (another line). So two lines in this row.\n\nRow4: 🐼✨🐼✨🐿🚀\nConsecutive groups:\nEach emoji is different. So no consecutive groups of >=2. So zero here.\n\nRow5: ✨🚀🐿🐼🚀🐼\nGroups:\nEach emoji is different. So no lines.\n\nRow6: 🚀✨✨🐿✨🚀\nGroups:\n🚀 (1), ✨✨ (2), 🐿 (1), ✨ (1), 🚀 (1). So one horizontal line here.\n\nSo total horizontal lines per row:\nRow1:2, row2:2, row3:2, row4:0, row5:0, row6:1. Sum is 2+2+2+0+0+1=7 horizontal lines.\n\nNow check vertical lines. For each column, check consecutive same emojis.\n\nColumns are 6 columns (since rows are 6 emojis each). Let's go column by column.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow1: 🐿\nRow2: 🐼\nRow3: ✨\nRow4: 🐼\nRow5: ✨\nRow6: 🚀\nAll different. So no vertical line here.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow1: 🐿\nRow2: 🐼\nRow3: ✨\nRow4: ✨\nRow5: 🚀\nRow6: ✨\nSo consecutive groups:\n\nLooking down the column:\n🐿, then 🐼 (different), then ✨ (next three rows are ✨, 🚀, ✨. Wait, row4 column2 is ✨, row5 is 🚀, row6 is ✨. So only row3 and row4 (rows 3 and 4) have ✨ in column2. Are they consecutive? Let's see:\n\nRow3 column2: ✨\nRow4 column2: ✨ → so same. So that's two consecutive. Then row5 is 🚀, different. So that's a vertical line of length 2 (rows3-4). So that's one vertical line here.\n\nWait, let's list the column:\n\nColumn2 entries:\n\nRow1: 🐿\nRow2: 🐼\nRow3: ✨\nRow4: ✨\nRow5: 🚀\nRow6: ✨\n\nSo in column2, the consecutive same emojis are:\n\nRow3 and row4: ✨✨ → length 2.

No vertical lines.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow1: 🐼\nRow2: 🚀\nRow3: 🐿\nRow4: ✨\nRow5: 🐼\nRow6: 🐿\nAll different.

Let's recheck:\n\nColumn2 entries:\n\nRow1: 🐿\n\nRow2: 🐼\n\nRow3: ✨\n\nRow4: ✨ → same as row3 → consecutive two.\n\nRow5: 🚀 → different.\n\nRow6: ✨ → different from row5.\n\nSo column2 has a vertical line of length 2 (rows3-4). So that's one vertical line.\n\nOther columns:\n\nCheck column5 again. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's recheck:\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow1: 🐼 (row1, column5 is 🐼)\n\nRow2: row2 column5 is 🚀 (since row2 is 🐼🐼🐿🚀🚀🐼. So positions 5 and 6 are 🚀 and 🐼. So column5 for row2 is the fifth element, which is 🚀.\n\nRow3: column5 is the fifth element of row3: ✨✨🚀🐿✨✨ → fifth is ✨.\n\nRow4: column5 is the fifth element of row4: 🐼✨🐼✨🐿🚀 → fifth element is 🐿.\n\nRow5: column5 is fifth element of row5: ✨🚀🐿🐼🚀🐼 → fifth is 🚀.\n\nRow6: column5 is fifth of row6: 🚀✨✨🐿✨🚀 → fifth is ✨.\n\nSo column5 entries: 🐼, 🚀, ✨, 🐿, 🚀, ✨. All different. So no vertical line here.\n\nWhat about column5?\n\nWait, in row1 column5 is 🐼 (from the first row: positions 1 to 6. So row1 is 🐿 (1), 🐿 (2), 🐼 (3), 🐼 (4), 🐼 (5), 🚀 (6). So column5 is 🐼 (row1, column5).\n\nRow2: the fifth element is 🚀 (since row2 is 🐼🐼🐿🚀🚀🐼 → positions 4 and 5 are 🚀, so column5 is 🚀.\n\nRow3: fifth element is ✨ (row3 is ✨✨🚀🐿✨✨ → fifth is ✨.\n\nSo column5 is:\n\nRow1: 🐼\n\nRow2: 🚀 → different from row1.\n\nRow3: ✨ → different.\n\nRow4: row4 is 🐼✨🐼✨🐿🚀 → fifth element is 🐿.\n\nRow5: ✨🚀🐿🐼🚀🐼 → fifth is 🚀.\n\nRow6: fifth is ✨.\n\nSo column5 entries are: 🐼, 🚀, ✨, 🐿, 🚀, ✨. All different. No vertical lines.\n\nNow column6:\n\nRow1: 🚀 (column6 is 6th element of row1: 🚀.\n\nRow2: 🐼 (row2's sixth element is 🐼.\n\nRow3: ✨ (sixth is ✨.\n\nRow4: 🚀 (sixth element.\n\nRow5: 🐼 (sixth.\n\nRow6: 🚀 (sixth.\n\nSo column6 entries: 🚀, 🐼, ✨, 🚀, 🐼, 🚀. All different. So no vertical lines.\n\nNow check column2 again.\n\nAnother column to check: column5?\n\nNo, already checked.\n\nNext, column4.\n\nWait, column4 entries:\n\nRow1: 🐼 (position4 of row1: positions are 1-6. Row1: 🐿🐿🐼🐼🐼🚀 → position4 is 🐼.\n\nRow2: column4 is position4 of row2, which is 🚀 (since row2 is 🐼🐼🐿🚀🚀🐼 → positions4 is 🚀.\n\nRow3: column4 is 🐿 (row3: ✨✨🚀🐿✨✨ → position4 is 🐿.\n\nRow4: column4 is position4 of row4: 🐼✨🐼✨🐿🚀 → position4 is ✨.\n\nRow5: column4 is 🐼 (row5: ✨🚀🐿🐼🚀🐼 → position4 is 🐼.\n\nRow6: column4 is 🐿 (row6: 🚀✨✨🐿✨🚀 → position4 is 🐿.\n\nSo column4 entries: 🐼, 🚀, 🐿, ✨, 🐼, 🐿. All different. No vertical lines.\n\nHmm. Let's check column2 again. Oh, column2 has a vertical line of length 2 (rows3 and4) with ✨.\n\nOther columns:\n\nLet's check column6 again. No.\n\nWhat about column1:\n\nRow1: 🐿\n\nRow2: 🐼\n\nRow3: ✨\n\nRow4: 🐼\n\nRow5: ✨\n\nRow6: 🚀\n\nAll different. No vertical lines.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow1: 🐼 (position3)\n\nRow2: 🐿 (position3)\n\nRow3: 🚀 (position3)\n\nRow4: 🐼 (position3)\n\nRow5: 🐿 (position3)\n\nRow6: ✨ (position3)\n\nAll different. No vertical lines.\n\nSo vertical lines are only in column2, which has one line of length 2.\n\nWait, what about other columns? Let's check column3 again. Wait, any vertical lines?\n\nNo. Column3's entries:\n\nRow1: 🐼\n\nRow2: 🐿\n\nRow3: 🚀\n\nRow4: 🐼\n\nRow5: 🐿\n\nRow6: ✨\n\nNo consecutive same.\n\nWhat about column4? No.\n\nWait, another column to check: column5. No.\n\nWhat about column6? No.\n\nSo vertical lines total is 1.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing some other vertical lines. Let's check again.\n\nAnother look at column2:\n\nRow3: ✨\n\nRow4: ✨\n\nSo rows3-4. That's two consecutive same. So that's a vertical line of length 2. So counts as one.\n\nAny others?\n\nCheck column5 again:\n\nRow5's column5 is 🚀. What about row5 and row6?\n\nRow5, column5: 🚀\n\nRow6, column5: ✨ → different.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother possibility: column6 in rows1 and6 have 🚀. Not consecutive.\n\nOther possibilities: Let's check row4's column4. No.\n\nHmm. So vertical lines count is 1.\n\nWait, let's check all columns again carefully.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRows1-6: 🐿, 🐼, ✨, 🐼, ✨, 🚀. No consecutive same.\n\nColumn2: 🐿, 🐼, ✨, ✨, 🚀, ✨. The only consecutive same are rows3-4 (✨✨), so one line.\n\nColumn3: entries are 🐼, 🐿, 🚀, 🐼, 🐿, ✨. No.\n\nColumn4: 🐼, 🚀, 🐿, ✨, 🐼, 🐿. No.\n\nColumn5: 🐼, 🚀, ✨, 🐿, 🚀, ✨. No consecutive same.\n\nColumn6: 🚀, 🐼, ✨, 🚀, 🐼, 🚀. No two consecutive same.\n\nSo vertical lines total is 1.\n\nSo total lines (horizontal + vertical) is 7 +1=8?\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, in the initial rows:\n\nRow3: ✨✨🚀🐿✨✨ → the groups are ✨✨ (counts as one), then after 🚀 and 🐿, two more ✨✨. So two horizontal lines here. That's correct.\n\nRow6: 🚀✨✨🐿✨🚀 → groups: 🚀 (1), ✨✨ (2), 🐿 (1), ✨ (1), 🚀 (1). So one horizontal line here.\n\nSo the horizontal lines sum is 7. Vertical lines are 1. So total 8.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed vertical lines elsewhere. Let me check again.\n\nAnother approach: For vertical lines, for each column, check consecutive same emojis.\n\nFor example, column2:\n\nRow3 and 4 are same (✨). Are there any other consecutive same in this column?\n\nRow6 is ✨, but row5 is 🚀. So rows3-4 is the only consecutive same in column2.\n\nWhat about column5?\n\nRow5's entry is 🚀. Previous row (row4) is 🐿. Next row (row6) is ✨. No.\n\nOther columns:\n\nWait, column6:\n\nRow1: 🚀.\n\nRow2: 🐼.\n\nRow3: ✨.\n\nRow4: 🚀.\n\nRow5: 🐼.\n\nRow6: 🚀.\n\nNo consecutive same entries.\n\nAnother possible mistake: column4.\n\nWait, column4's entries:\n\nRow1: 🐼.\n\nRow2: 🚀.\n\nRow3: 🐿.\n\nRow4: ✨.\n\nRow5: 🐼.\n\nRow6: 🐿.\n\nNo consecutive same.\n\nWhat about column5:\n\nRow1: 🐼.\n\nRow2: 🚀.\n\nRow3: ✨.\n\nRow4: 🐿.\n\nRow5: 🚀.\n\nRow6: ✨.\n\nNo consecutive same.\n\nSo vertical lines are indeed only 1.\n\nThus, the total lines are 7 (horizontal) + 1 (vertical) = 8.\n\nWait, but let me recheck the horizontal lines again. Let's go row by row again.\n\nRow1: 🐿🐿🐼🐼🐼🚀 → two groups of >=2. So 2.\n\nRow2: 🐼🐼🐿🚀🚀🐼 → two groups (🐼🐼 and 🚀🚀). So 2.\n\nRow3: ✨✨🚀🐿✨✨ → two groups (first two ✨ and last two ✨). So 2.\n\nRow4: 🐼✨🐼✨🐿🚀 → all single. 0.\n\nRow5: ✨🚀🐿🐼🚀🐼 → all single. 0.\n\nRow6: 🚀✨✨🐿✨🚀 → one group (✨✨). So 1.\n\nSum: 2+2+2+0+0+1=7. Correct.\n\nVertical: 1. So total is 8.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says to count the number of lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more. So each line (maximal consecutive) of 2 or more. So for example, a line of length 3 counts as 1. So the previous calculation is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be 8. But wait, perhaps I missed another vertical line somewhere. Let me recheck.\n\nAnother thing to check: the column2's entries. Row3 and row4 are ✨, but row6 is also ✨ (but not consecutive). So no. Only two in a row.\n\nOther columns:\n\nWhat about column5, rows5 and 6? Let's see column5:\n\nRow5: 🚀.\n\nRow6: ✨. Different. No.\n\nWhat about row2 and row3 in column5: row2 is 🚀, row3 is ✨. Different.\n\nAnother possible vertical line: column3, rows1 and 2? Column3 entries:\n\nRow1: 🐼.\n\nRow2: 🐿. Different.\n\nNo.\n\nWhat about row4 and row5 in column3: row4 is 🐼, row5 is 🐿. Different.\n\nHmm. I don't think I missed any.\n\nSo the total lines are 7+1=8. So the answer is 8.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count horizontal and vertical lines of the same emoji with a length of 2 or more. A \"line\" is defined as a maximal consecutive sequence of the same emoji in a row (horizontal) or column (vertical).\n\n### Horizontal Lines Analysis\n1. **Row 1**: 🐿🐿🐼🐼🐼🚀  \n   - 🐿🐿 (length 2) and 🐼🐼🐼 (length 3) → **2 lines**.\n2. **Row 2**: 🐼🐼🐿🚀🚀🐼  \n   - 🐼🐼 (length 2) and 🚀🚀 (length 2) → **2 lines**.\n3. **Row 3**: ✨✨🚀🐿✨✨  \n   - ✨✨ (length 2) and ✨✨ (length 2) → **2 lines**.\n4. **Row 4**: 🐼✨🐼✨🐿🚀  \n   - No consecutive groups ≥2 → **0 lines**.\n5. **Row 5**: ✨🚀🐿🐼🚀🐼  \n   - No consecutive groups ≥2 → **0 lines**.\n6. **Row 6**: 🚀✨✨🐿✨🚀  \n   - ✨✨ (length 2) → **1 line**.\n\n**Total horizontal lines**: \\(2 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 7\\).\n\n### Vertical Lines Analysis\n1. **Column 1**: 🐿, 🐼, ✨, 🐼, ✨, 🚀 → No consecutive matches → **0 lines**.\n2. **Column 2**: 🐿, 🐼, ✨, ✨, 🚀, ✨  \n   - ✨✨ (rows 3-4) → **1 line**.\n3. **Columns 3-6**: All columns have no consecutive matches → **0 lines**.\n\n**Total vertical lines**: \\(1\\).\n\n### Final Answer\nSumming horizontal and vertical lines: \\(7 + 1 = 8\\).  \nAnswer: 8"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Let's see. The board is given as a 10x10 grid of emojis, right? So each line can be either horizontal (same row) or vertical (same column). And a line is a sequence of the same emoji, with length 2 or more. But wait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji\"—so each line is a consecutive sequence of the same emoji, right?\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the problem says \"horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" Hmm. So maybe it's any straight line (horizontal or vertical) where all the emojis are the same, and the length is at least 2. But does that mean sequences in a row or column where adjacent cells are the same, forming a line? For example, like in a game of connect four or something.\n\nLet me think. For example, in a horizontal line, if a row has three same emojis in a row, that's a line of length 3. Similarly, in a vertical line, if three same emojis are stacked in a column. But also, if there's a line of two, that counts once. So the total count would be for each possible line in horizontal and vertical directions, how many such lines exist.\n\nBut wait, how do we count overlapping lines? For example, a sequence of three same emojis in a row. Does that count as one line of length 3, or two lines (the first two and the last two, or each possible consecutive pair)? Or does each maximal consecutive sequence count once, regardless of length. For example, a run of four same emojis in a row would count as one line (because it's a single continuous line). Because the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\"—so each line is a single maximal sequence. So in a row, if there are three consecutive same emojis, that's one line. But if there are two separate pairs (like A A B B), that's two lines.\n\nSo the approach is: for each row, check all horizontal lines (max sequences of same emoji of length >=2) and count each such sequence. Similarly for each column, check vertical lines.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Iterate over each row. For each row, split into consecutive runs of the same emoji. For each run, if the run length is >=2, add 1 to the count. For example, in a row like 🦙🦙🐩🦙🐩🐰🐩🍂🐳🐩, looking for horizontal lines. Let's take the first row: the first two are 🦙🦙, that's a run of 2, so count +1. Then 🦙 again later but separated by others. So perhaps another run if it's consecutive. Wait, let's actually parse the first row.\n\nFirst row: 🦙🦙🐩🦙🐩🐰🐩🍂🐳🐩. Breaking it down:\n\nPositions 1-2: 🦙🦙 (length 2) → count 1.\n\nThen position 3: 🐩.\n\nPosition4: 🦙 (not consecutive with previous two).\n\nThen position5: 🐩.\n\nSo the first row's horizontal runs would be:\n\n- 🦙x2 → count +=1.\n\nThen, looking at the rest of the row. Next, position 4 is 🦙, but after 🐩, so a single 🦙 (no run). Then 🐩 again in position5. Then position6: 🐰. So the runs here are all 1s, except the first run. So in row 1, horizontal count is 1.\n\nBut I need to make sure. Let me check the first row again:\n\nRow 1: 🦙🦙🐩🦙🐩🐰🐩🍂🐳🐩.\n\nThe first two are same, then a different. So that's a run of 2. Then the third is different. Then fourth is 🦙 (same as first but after a different). So fourth is a single. Then fifth is 🐩 (same as third, but fourth was different, so fifth is a new run. So fifth is a single. Then sixth is 🐰, seventh is 🐩, etc. So the only horizontal run in row1 is the first two 🦙. So that's 1.\n\nThen, moving to the second row:\n\n🌙🦙🌓🌓🌙🐳🌓🐩🌙🌙\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1: 🌙\n\n2: 🦙 → different.\n\n3-4: 🌓🌓 → run of 2 → count +=1.\n\n5: 🌙 → different from previous.\n\n6: 🐳.\n\n7: 🌓 → different from previous.\n\n8: 🐩.\n\n9-10: 🌙🌙 → run of 2 → count +=1.\n\nSo in row2, two horizontal runs (positions3-4 and 9-10). So row2 contributes 2.\n\nSimilarly, process all rows and columns.\n\nSo for each row, we need to find all runs of same emoji with length >=2. Then sum all those. Then do the same for each column.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize count =0.\n\nFor each row in the board:\n\n   current_emoji = first element.\n\n   current_length =1.\n\n   for each element from second to last in row:\n\n       if element == current_emoji:\n\n           current_length +=1\n\n       else:\n\n           if current_length >=2:\n\n               count +=1\n\n           current_emoji = element\n\n           current_length =1\n\n   after loop, check if current_length >=2 → if yes, add to count.\n\nThen do the same for each column:\n\nfor each column in board:\n\n   current_emoji = first element of column.\n\n   current_length =1.\n\n   for each element from second to last in column:\n\n       if element == current_emoji:\n\n           current_length +=1\n\n       else:\n\n           if current_length >=2:\n\n               count +=1\n\n           current_emoji = element\n\n           current_length =1\n\n   after loop, check if current_length >=2 → add to count.\n\nBut wait, wait. For a run in a row\/column, each maximal consecutive sequence of same emoji of length >=2 is counted once. So for example, a row with 4 same emojis would be a single run (count +=1). For a row with 5 same emojis → count +=1. For a row with two runs of two same emojis (like A A B B), that would be two counts.\n\nSo the code would process each row and column, and for each, count the number of maximal runs of length >=2.\n\nNow, the challenge is to process each row and column correctly.\n\nNow, let's process the given board row by row and column by column.\n\nBut since I can't code here, I need to do it manually.\n\nFirst, let me list the board as rows. Let's index rows from 0 to 9, and columns 0 to9.\n\nRow 0: 🦙🦙🐩🦙🐩🐰🐩🍂🐳🐩 (positions 0-9)\n\nRow 1: 🌙🦙🌓🌓🌙🐳🌓🐩🌙🌙\n\nRow 2: 🌙🌓🌓🐩🌿🌙🐰🌙🦙🍂\n\nRow 3: 🐰🌓🌙🌓🐳🐰🦙🌙🍂🌓\n\nRow 4: 🍂🌙🐩🐳🍂🦙🍂🌓🐰🌓\n\nRow 5: 🦙🐳🍂🌿🐳🐩🌿🐰🐰🍂\n\nRow 6: 🐳🦙🌙🐩🍂🐳🌙🐩🌓🌓\n\nRow 7: 🌙🦙🌿🌿🐳🌓🌿🐰🌿🌙\n\nRow 8: 🦙🐰🍂🐳🐩🐰🦙🐰🌙🐩\n\nRow 9: 🍂🐩🌿🌿🐳🌓🐳🐳🐩🐰\n\nNow, let's process each row for horizontal runs.\n\nRow 0: 🦙🦙🐩🦙🐩🐰🐩🍂🐳🐩\n\nLooking at each emoji:\n\nStart with first: 🦙. current_length=1.\n\nNext emoji is 🦙 → current_length=2. Then next is 🐩. So here, the run ends. current_length >=2 → count +=1. So count becomes 1.\n\nThen the next emoji is 🦙 (position3). current_length=1. Next is 🐩 → check. current_length=1, no addition. Then next (position4) is 🐩 → same as previous? Wait, position3 is 🦙, position4 is 🐩. So after position3 (🦙), next is position4 (🐩) → different. So run ends, current_length=1, no add. So for position3, 🦙 is a single. Then position4 is 🐩. current_length=1. Next is 🐰 → different. So run ends. No add. Then 🐰 is position5. current_length=1. Next is 🐩 (position6). Different. No add. Then 🐩 in position6. current_length=1. Next is 🍂 (position7). Different. No add. Then 🍂 (position7). current_length=1. Next is 🐳 (position8). Different. Then 🐳 (position8). current_length=1. Next is 🐩 (position9). Different. So no runs after the initial two.\n\nSo row0's horizontal count is 1.\n\nRow1: 🌙🦙🌓🌓🌙🐳🌓🐩🌙🌙\n\nLet's process:\n\nStart with 🌙. current_length=1.\n\nNext is 🦙. Different. So check current_length=1 → no add. Then current_emoji is 🦙, current_length=1.\n\nNext is 🌓 (position2). Different → check. current_length=1 → no add. Then current_emoji=🌓, current_length=1.\n\nNext is 🌓 (position3). Same → current_length=2. Then next is 🌙 (position4). Different → run ends. current_length >=2 → add 1 (count +=1, total now 2).\n\ncurrent_emoji=🌙, current_length=1.\n\nNext is 🐳 (position5). Different. Check → current_length=1 → no add. current_emoji=🐳, current_length=1.\n\nNext is 🌓 (position6). Different → check → current_length=1. New emoji: 🌓, current_length=1.\n\nNext is 🐩 (position7). Different → check → no. New emoji: 🐩, current_length=1.\n\nNext is 🌙 (position8). Different → check. New emoji: 🌙, current_length=1.\n\nNext is 🌙 (position9). Same → current_length=2. End of row. So check → current_length >=2 → add 1 (count +=1, total now 3).\n\nSo row1 contributes 2 runs (the 🌓🌓 and 🌙🌙). So row1's horizontal count is 2. So total count after row1 is 1+2=3.\n\nRow2: 🌙🌓🌓🐩🌿🌙🐰🌙🦙🍂\n\nProcessing:\n\nStart with 🌙. current_length=1.\n\nNext is 🌓 (position1). Different. Check → no. current_emoji=🌓, length=1.\n\nNext is 🌓 (position2). Same → length=2. Then next is 🐩 (position3). Different → add 1 (count +=1, total now 4). current_emoji=🐩, length=1.\n\nNext is 🌿 (position4). Different → check → no. current_emoji=🌿, length=1.\n\nNext is 🌙 (position5). Different → check → no. current_emoji=🌙, length=1.\n\nNext is 🐰 (position6). Different → check → no. current_emoji=🐰, length=1.\n\nNext is 🌙 (position7). Different → check → no. current_emoji=🌙, length=1.\n\nNext is 🦙 (position8). Different → check → no. current_emoji=🦙, length=1.\n\nNext is 🍂 (position9). Different → check → no. End of row. So the only run here is 🌓🌓 → adds 1. So row2 contributes 1. Total count now 4.\n\nRow3: 🐰🌓🌙🌓🐳🐰🦙🌙🍂🌓\n\nProcessing:\n\nStart with 🐰 (length=1).\n\nNext is 🌓 → different. current_emoji=🌓, length=1.\n\nNext is 🌙 → different. current_emoji=🌙, length=1.\n\nNext is 🌓 → different. current_emoji=🌓, length=1.\n\nNext is 🐳 → different. current_emoji=🐳, length=1.\n\nNext is 🐰 → different. current_emoji=🐰, length=1.\n\nNext is 🦙 → different. current_emoji=🦙, length=1.\n\nNext is 🌙 → different. current_emoji=🌙, length=1.\n\nNext is 🍂 → different. current_emoji=🍂, length=1.\n\nNext is 🌓 → different. current_emoji=🌓, length=1.\n\nNo runs in row3. So contribution is 0. Total remains 4.\n\nRow4: 🍂🌙🐩🐳🍂🦙🍂🌓🐰🌓\n\nProcessing:\n\nStart with 🍂. Next is 🌙 → different. length=1. So no run.\n\nThen 🐩 → different.\n\nThen 🐳 → different.\n\nThen 🍂 (position4): different from previous 🐳. So 🍂 is new emoji, length=1.\n\nThen 🦙 (position5): different. So no.\n\nThen 🍂 (position6): different from 🦙 → new emoji, length=1.\n\nThen 🌓 (position7): different. \n\nThen 🐰 (position8): different. \n\nThen 🌓 (position9): different. \n\nSo row4 has no runs. Contribution 0. Total remains 4.\n\nRow5: 🦙🐳🍂🌿🐳🐩🌿🐰🐰🍂\n\nProcessing:\n\nStart with 🦙. Next is 🐳 → different. length=1. So no.\n\nThen 🍂 → different.\n\nThen 🌿 → different.\n\nThen 🐳 (position4). Different from 🌿. Emoji is 🐳, length=1.\n\nThen 🐩 (position5). Different.\n\nThen 🌿 (position6). Different.\n\nThen 🐰 (position7). Different.\n\nThen 🐰 (position8). Same as previous. current_length becomes 2. Next is 🍂 (position9). Different → add 1. So this run (🐰🐰) contributes 1. So row5's contribution is 1. Total now 5.\n\nRow6: 🐳🦙🌙🐩🍂🐳🌙🐩🌓🌓\n\nProcessing:\n\nStart with 🐳. Next is 🦙 → different. length=1.\n\nThen 🌙 → different.\n\nThen 🐩 → different.\n\nThen 🍂 → different.\n\nThen 🐳 (position5). Different. Emoji is 🐳, length=1.\n\nThen 🌙 (position6). Different.\n\nThen 🐩 (position7). Different.\n\nThen 🌓 (position8). Different.\n\nThen 🌓 (position9). Same → current_length=2. End of row → add 1. So this run (🌓🌓) contributes 1. So row6's contribution is 1. Total now 6.\n\nRow7: 🌙🦙🌿🌿🐳🌓🌿🐰🌿🌙\n\nProcessing:\n\nStart with 🌙. Next is 🦙 → different. length=1.\n\nThen 🌿 (position2). Different.\n\nThen 🌿 (position3). Same → current_length=2. Next is 🐳 (position4). Different → add 1. So this run (🌿🌿) contributes 1.\n\nNext, 🐳 (position4). Emoji=🐳, length=1.\n\nThen 🌓 (position5). Different.\n\nThen 🌿 (position6). Different. Emoji=🌿, length=1.\n\nThen 🐰 (position7). Different.\n\nThen 🌿 (position8). Different. Emoji=🌿, length=1.\n\nThen 🌙 (position9). Different. \n\nSo row7 has one run (🌿🌿) → contribution 1. Total now 7.\n\nRow8: 🦙🐰🍂🐳🐩🐰🦙🐰🌙🐩\n\nProcessing:\n\nStart with 🦙. Next is 🐰 → different. length=1.\n\nThen 🍂 → different.\n\nThen 🐳 → different.\n\nThen 🐩 → different.\n\nThen 🐰 → different.\n\nThen 🦙 → different.\n\nThen 🐰 → different.\n\nThen 🌙 → different.\n\nThen 🐩 → different.\n\nNo runs. Contribution 0. Total remains 7.\n\nRow9: 🍂🐩🌿🌿🐳🌓🐳🐳🐩🐰\n\nProcessing:\n\nStart with 🍂. Next is 🐩 → different.\n\nThen 🌿 (position2). Different.\n\nThen 🌿 (position3). Same → current_length=2. Next is 🐳 (position4). Different → add 1. So this run (🌿🌿) contributes 1.\n\nThen 🐳 (position4). length=1.\n\nNext is 🌓 (position5). Different.\n\nThen 🐳 (position6). Different.\n\nThen 🐳 (position7). Same → current_length=2. Next is 🐩 (position8). Different → add 1. So this run (🐳🐳) contributes 1.\n\nSo row9 has two runs (🌿🌿 and 🐳🐳) → contribution 2. Total now 7+2=9.\n\nSo sum of horizontal runs is 9.\n\nNow process vertical runs. Each column has 10 emojis. Need to check for each column the vertical runs.\n\nLet me list each column:\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow0: 🦙\n\nRow1: 🌙\n\nRow2: 🌙\n\nRow3: 🐰\n\nRow4: 🍂\n\nRow5: 🦙\n\nRow6: 🐳\n\nRow7: 🌙\n\nRow8: 🦙\n\nRow9: 🍂\n\nSo column 0 has elements: 🦙, 🌙, 🌙, 🐰, 🍂, 🦙, 🐳, 🌙, 🦙, 🍂.\n\nProcessing this column:\n\nStart with 🦙 (row0). current_length=1.\n\nRow1: 🌙 → different. Check current_length=1 → no. current_emoji=🌙, length=1.\n\nRow2: 🌙 → same → length=2. Next row3: 🐰 → different. So run of 2 → add 1 (vertical count +=1).\n\nThen row3: 🐰 → new emoji, length=1.\n\nRow4: 🍂 → different. Check → no. new emoji=🍂, length=1.\n\nRow5: 🦙 → different. new emoji=🦙, length=1.\n\nRow6: 🐳 → different. new emoji=🐳, length=1.\n\nRow7: 🌙 → different. new emoji=🌙, length=1.\n\nRow8: 🦙 → different. new emoji=🦙, length=1.\n\nRow9: 🍂 → different. new emoji=🍂, length=1.\n\nSo column0 has one vertical run (🌙🌙). So vertical count is 1.\n\nColumn1:\n\nRow0: 🦙\n\nRow1: 🦙\n\nRow2: 🌓\n\nRow3: 🌓\n\nRow4: 🌙\n\nRow5: 🐳\n\nRow6: 🦙\n\nRow7: 🦙\n\nRow8: 🐰\n\nRow9: 🐩\n\nColumn1 elements: 🦙, 🦙, 🌓, 🌓, 🌙, 🐳, 🦙, 🦙, 🐰, 🐩.\n\nProcessing:\n\nRow0: 🦙 → start. length=1.\n\nRow1: 🦙 → same → length=2. row2: 🌓 → different. So run of 2 → add 1 (vertical count now 2).\n\ncurrent_emoji=🌓, length=1.\n\nRow3: 🌓 → same → length=2. row4: 🌙 → different. add 1 (count 3).\n\ncurrent_emoji=🌙, length=1.\n\nRow5: 🐳 → different. Check → no.\n\ncurrent_emoji=🐳, length=1.\n\nRow6: 🦙 → different. current_emoji=🦙, length=1.\n\nRow7: 🦙 → same → length=2. row8: 🐰 → different. add 1 (count 4).\n\nrow9: 🐩 → different.\n\nSo column1 has three runs: 🦙🦙, 🌓🌓, 🦙🦙 → total 3 vertical runs. So vertical count is 3 from column1. So overall vertical count is now 1 (column0) +3 (column1) =4.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: 🐩\n\nRow1: 🌓\n\nRow2: 🌓\n\nRow3: 🌙\n\nRow4: 🐩\n\nRow5: 🍂\n\nRow6: 🌙\n\nRow7: 🌿\n\nRow8: 🍂\n\nRow9: 🌿\n\nColumn2 elements: 🐩, 🌓, 🌓, 🌙, 🐩, 🍂, 🌙, 🌿, 🍂, 🌿.\n\nProcessing:\n\nRow0: 🐩 → length=1.\n\nRow1: 🌓 → different. Check → no. current_emoji=🌓, length=1.\n\nRow2: 🌓 → same → length=2. row3: 🌙 → different. add 1 (vertical count now 5).\n\ncurrent_emoji=🌙, length=1.\n\nRow4: 🐩 → different. Check → no. current_emoji=🐩, length=1.\n\nRow5: 🍂 → different. Check → no. current_emoji=🍂, length=1.\n\nRow6: 🌙 → different. current_emoji=🌙, length=1.\n\nRow7: 🌿 → different. current_emoji=🌿, length=1.\n\nRow8: 🍂 → different. current_emoji=🍂, length=1.\n\nRow9: 🌿 → different. current_emoji=🌿, length=1.\n\nSo column2 has one run (🌓🌓). vertical count now 5.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🦙\n\nRow1: 🌓\n\nRow2: 🐩\n\nRow3: 🌓\n\nRow4: 🐳\n\nRow5: 🌿\n\nRow6: 🐩\n\nRow7: 🌿\n\nRow8: 🐳\n\nRow9: 🌿\n\nColumn3 elements: 🦙, 🌓, 🐩, 🌓, 🐳, 🌿, 🐩, 🌿, 🐳, 🌿.\n\nProcessing:\n\nRow0: 🦙 → length=1.\n\nRow1: 🌓 → different. Check → no.\n\ncurrent_emoji=🌓, length=1.\n\nRow2: 🐩 → different. Check → no. current_emoji=🐩, length=1.\n\nRow3: 🌓 → different. Check → no. current_emoji=🌓, length=1.\n\nRow4: 🐳 → different. current_emoji=🐳, length=1.\n\nRow5: 🌿 → different. current_emoji=🌿, length=1.\n\nRow6: 🐩 → different. current_emoji=🐩, length=1.\n\nRow7: 🌿 → different. current_emoji=🌿, length=1.\n\nRow8: 🐳 → different. current_emoji=🐳, length=1.\n\nRow9: 🌿 → different. current_emoji=🌿, length=1.\n\nNo runs in column3. vertical count remains 5.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow0: 🐩\n\nRow1: 🌙\n\nRow2: 🌿\n\nRow3: 🐳\n\nRow4: 🍂\n\nRow5: 🐳\n\nRow6: 🍂\n\nRow7: 🐳\n\nRow8: 🐩\n\nRow9: 🐳\n\nColumn4 elements: 🐩, 🌙, 🌿, 🐳, 🍂, 🐳, 🍂, 🐳, 🐩, 🐳.\n\nProcessing:\n\nRow0: 🐩 → length=1.\n\nRow1: 🌙 → different.

Check → no.\n\nRow2: 🍂 → different. Check → no.\n\nRow3: 🌓 → different. current_emoji=🌓, length=1.\n\nRow4: 🌓 → same → length=2. row5: 🍂 → different. add 1 (vertical count now 7).\n\ncurrent_emoji=🍂, length=1.\n\nRow6: 🌓 → different. current_emoji=🌓, length=1.\n\nRow7: 🌙 → different. Check → no.\n\nRow8: 🐩 → different. Check → no.\n\nRow9: 🐰 → different. Check → no.\n\nSo column9 has one run (🌓🌓). vertical count now 7.\n\nSo summing up all vertical runs: columns 0 (1), 1 (3), 2 (1), 7 (1), 9 (1). Total vertical runs: 1+3+1+1+1=7.\n\nWait, let me recheck:\n\ncolumns0: 1\n\ncolumns1:3\n\ncolumn2:1\n\ncolumn3:0\n\ncolumn4:0\n\ncolumn5:0\n\ncolumn6:0\n\ncolumn7:1\n\ncolumn8:0\n\ncolumn9:1\n\nSo 1+3=4, +1 (column2)=5, +1 (column7)=6, +1 (column9)=7. So vertical count is 7.\n\nNow, the total count is horizontal runs (9) + vertical runs (7) → 16.\n\nWait, but earlier calculation for horizontal runs was 9, vertical runs 7. So 9+7=16. But let's recheck.\n\nHorizontal runs:\n\nRow0:1\n\nRow1:2 → 3\n\nRow2:1 →4\n\nRow3:0 →4\n\nRow4:0 →4\n\nRow5:1 →5\n\nRow6:1 →6\n\nRow7:1 →7\n\nRow8:0 →7\n\nRow9:2 →9.\n\nSo horizontal total 9.\n\nVertical runs:\n\ncolumns0:1\n\ncolumns1:3 →4\n\ncolumn2:1 →5\n\ncolumn7:1 →6\n\ncolumn9:1 →7.\n\nTotal vertical 7.\n\nSo 9+7=16. So the answer is 16.\n\nBut wait, did I make any mistake in processing the columns?\n\nLet me recheck column1's vertical runs.\n\nColumn1 elements:\n\nRow0: 🦙\n\nRow1: 🦙\n\nRow2: 🌓\n\nRow3: 🌓\n\nRow4: 🌙\n\nRow5: 🐳\n\nRow6: 🦙\n\nRow7: 🦙\n\nRow8: 🐰\n\nRow9: 🐩\n\nProcessing:\n\nRow0: 🦙 → length=1.\n\nRow1: same → length=2. → run of 2.\n\nThen row2: 🌓 → different. So add 1. vertical count increases by 1.\n\nThen row2: 🌓 → current_emoji=🌓, length=1.\n\nRow3: same → length=2. Then row4: 🌙 → different. Add 1. → vertical count now increased by another 1.\n\nThen row4: 🌙 → current_emoji=🌙, length=1.\n\nRow5: 🐳 → different. Check → no.\n\nRow6: 🦙 → different. current_emoji=🦙, length=1.\n\nRow7: same → length=2. Then row8: 🐰 → different. Add 1. So for column1, three runs: 🦙🦙, 🌓🌓, 🦙🦙 → each contributes 1. So that's three vertical runs from column1. So yes, column1 contributes 3.\n\nSo the vertical total is 7. So 9+7=16.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure all columns are correctly processed.\n\nAnother column to check: column7. Let's see.\n\nColumn7 elements: 🍂, 🐩, 🌙, 🌙, 🌓, 🐰, 🐩, 🐰, 🌙, 🐳.\n\nWait no, column7 is:\n\nRow0: 🍂 (column7?)\n\nWait, columns are numbered 0-9. For example, row0's elements are in columns 0-9. So column7 is the eighth element in each row (since indices start at 0).\n\nRow0's column7: 🍂 (row0's elements: 🦙🦙🐩🦙🐩🐰🐩🍂🐳🐩 → the eighth element is 🍂 (index7).\n\nRow1's column7: 🐩 (row1: 🌙🦙🌓🌓🌙🐳🌓🐩🌙🌙 → eighth element is 🐩.\n\nRow2's column7: 🌙 (row2: 🌙🌓🌓🐩🌿🌙🐰🌙🦙🍂 → eighth element is 🌙.\n\nRow3's column7: 🌙 (row3: 🐰🌓🌙🌓🐳🐰🦙🌙🍂🌓 → eighth element is 🌙.\n\nRow4's column7: 🌓 (row4: 🍂🌙🐩🐳🍂🦙🍂🌓🐰🌓 → eighth is 🌓.\n\nRow5's column7: 🐰 (row5: 🦙🐳🍂🌿🐳🐩🌿🐰🐰🍂 → eighth element is 🐰.\n\nRow6's column7: 🐩 (row6: 🐳🦙🌙🐩🍂🐳🌙🐩🌓🌓 → eighth is 🐩.\n\nRow7's column7: 🐰 (row7: 🌙🦙🌿🌿🐳🌓🌿🐰🌿🌙 → eighth element is 🐰.\n\nRow8's column7: 🌙 (row8: 🦙🐰🍂🐳🐩🐰🦙🐰🌙🐩 → eighth element is 🌙.\n\nRow9's column7: 🐳 (row9: 🍂🐩🌿🌿🐳🌓🐳🐳🐩🐰 → eighth element is 🐳.\n\nSo column7 elements are: 🍂, 🐩, 🌙, 🌙, 🌓, 🐰, 🐩, 🐰, 🌙, 🐳.\n\nProcessing:\n\nStart with 🍂 (length=1).\n\nNext is 🐩 → different. Check → no. current_emoji=🐩, length=1.\n\nNext is 🌙 → different. current_emoji=🌙, length=1.\n\nNext is 🌙 → same → length=2. Then next is 🌓 → different. Add 1. So vertical count increases by 1.\n\nSo column7 contributes 1 vertical run (🌙🌙). Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the vertical count is 7. Total sum 9+7=16. So the answer is 16.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal and vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more on a 10x10 grid. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Horizontal Lines**: For each row, identify consecutive sequences (runs) of the same emoji. Each run of length 2 or more contributes 1 to the count.\n2. **Vertical Lines**: For each column, similarly identify consecutive sequences of the same emoji. Each run of length 2 or more contributes 1 to the count.\n\n### Solution Code\nThe solution involves iterating through each row and column to count valid lines:\n- **For rows**: Traverse each row, track consecutive emojis, and count runs of length ≥2.\n- **For columns**: Traverse each column, track consecutive emojis, and count runs of length ≥2.\n\n### Analysis\n1. **Horizontal Analysis**: Each row is examined for consecutive emojis. For example, the first row `🦙🦙🐩🦙🐩🐰🐩🍂🐳🐩` has one horizontal line (`🦙🦙`).\n2. **Vertical Analysis**: Each column is examined for consecutive emojis. For example, column 1 (`🦙, 🦙, 🌓, 🌓, 🌙, 🐳, 🦙, 🦙, 🐰, 🐩`) has three vertical lines (`🦙🦙`, `🌓🌓`, `🦙🦙`).\n\n### Results\n- **Horizontal Lines**: 9 valid lines.\n- **Vertical Lines**: 7 valid lines.\n- **Total Lines**: 9 + 7 = 16.\n\nAnswer: 16"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the board. The board has 10 rows and each row has 10 emojis. So it's a 10x10 grid. The task is to check each row and column for consecutive same emojis and count the lines that are of length 2 or longer. But wait, what's considered a \"line\"? Like, if there's a sequence of 3 same emojis in a row, does that count as one line of length 3 or two lines (length 2 and 3)? The problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". So perhaps each consecutive group of the same emoji counts as a separate line. For example, in a row like \"A A A B B\", there's one line of 3 A's and one line of 2 B's. So each group contributes once, regardless of its length. Or wait, maybe a sequence of length 3 contributes two lines (since there are two overlapping lines of two). Wait, the problem statement isn't clear. But the example given in the problem statement says \"output the total count of such lines\". So if a row has three same emojis in a row, like AAA, then how many lines does that contribute? Well, each possible line of length 2 or more. So for AAA, the possible lines are positions 1-2-3 (length 3), but the problem says lines of length 2 or more. Wait, maybe each consecutive run of N same emojis in a row (horizontal or vertical) contributes (N - 1) lines of length 2, (N-2) lines of length 3, etc. But that's probably not what the problem is asking. Because the example given in the problem's own sample is \"e.g. Answer: 192\", which makes me think that perhaps each run of K same emojis contributes 1 line, as long as K >=2. Because otherwise, the count could be very high.\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement. The task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more. So each consecutive run in a row or column that is of length 2 or longer counts as one line. So for example, a sequence of 3 same emojis in a row counts as one line (since the entire run is length 3, which is >=2). But wait, if in a row there are multiple separate runs, like A A A B B A A, then each run is considered. So the first AAA (counts as one line), BB (another line), and the AA (another line). Each run of length >=2 contributes one to the total count. So that's the approach.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each row, check for consecutive runs of the same emoji. For each run that has length >=2, increment the count by 1.\n\n2. For each column, do the same: check consecutive runs. Each run of length >=2 adds 1 to the count.\n\nThen sum all these counts from rows and columns.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Iterate through each row, check consecutive same emojis, count runs of 2+.\n\n- Iterate through each column, same thing.\n\nNow, the challenge is to parse the given board and process each row and column.\n\nLet's look at the input. The board is given as 10 lines, each line has 10 emojis. Let's parse each row as a list of emojis. Then process each row and column.\n\nSo for example, take the first row:\n\n🎃🦆🦆🐃🕷🌔🌔🦆🕷🌔\n\nLooking for consecutive runs:\n\n- 🎃 (1) → no.\n\n- 🦆🦆 (2) → count +=1.\n\n- then 🐃 (1) → no.\n\n- 🕷 (1) → no.\n\n- 🌔🌔 (2) → count +=1.\n\n- 🦆 (1) → no.\n\n- 🕷 (1) → no.\n\n- 🌔 (1) → no.\n\nSo in this row, two runs (the two 🦆s and the two 🌔s). So row contributes 2.\n\nNow for the columns. Each column is 10 emojis. For example, column 0: the first emoji of each row. Let's look at column 0:\n\nRow 0: 🎃\n\nRow 1: 🌒\n\nRow 2: 🐫\n\nRow 3: 🎃\n\nRow 4: 🕷\n\nRow 5: 🌒\n\nRow 6: 🦆\n\nRow 7: 🎃\n\nRow 8: 🌒\n\nRow 9: 🦆\n\nLooking at these, are there any consecutive same emojis in vertical lines?\n\nLet's see:\n\nRow 0: 🎃, row 1: 🌒 → different.\n\nRow 1: 🌒, row 2: 🐫 → different.\n\nRow 2: 🐫, row3: 🎃 → different.\n\nRow3: 🎃, row4: 🕷 → different.\n\nRow4: 🕷, row5: 🌒 → different.\n\nRow5: 🌒, row6: 🦆 → different.\n\nRow6: 🦆, row7: 🎃 → different.\n\nRow7: 🎃, row8: 🌒 → different.\n\nRow8: 🌒, row9: 🦆 → different.\n\nSo no consecutive runs in column 0. So column 0 contributes 0.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the first column's vertical lines are all single emojis, so no runs.\n\nNow, let's take another column. For example, column 1:\n\nRow0: 🦆\n\nRow1: 🐃\n\nRow2: 🐫\n\nRow3: 🦆\n\nRow4: 🐃\n\nRow5: 🐫\n\nRow6: 🐫\n\nRow7: 🎃\n\nRow8: 🐫\n\nRow9: 🌔\n\nLooking for consecutive same in vertical direction:\n\nRow0: 🦆, row1: 🐃 → different.\n\nRow1: 🐃, row2: 🐫 → different.\n\nRow2: 🐫, row3: 🦆 → different.\n\nRow3: 🦆, row4: 🐃 → different.\n\nRow4: 🐃, row5: 🐫 → different.\n\nRow5: 🐫, row6: 🐫 → same. So consecutive 2 here. So this is a run of 2. So count +=1.\n\nRow6: 🐫, row7: 🎃 → different.\n\nRow7: 🎃, row8: 🐫 → different.\n\nRow8: 🐫, row9: 🌔 → different.\n\nSo in column 1, there's a run of 2 (rows 5 and 6, 🐫🐫) → contributes 1.\n\nSo columns can have runs as well.\n\nSo the approach is to process each row and each column, check for consecutive runs of same emojis, and count each run of length >=2 as one.\n\nNow, the main challenge is to process each row and column correctly.\n\nLet me try to code this in my mind. Well, since I can't actually code, I'll have to simulate it mentally.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, process all the rows.\n\nLet's list all the rows:\n\nRow 0: 🎃🦆🦆🐃🕷🌔🌔🦆🕷🌔 → 2 runs.\n\nRow 1: 🌒🐃🎃🐃🦆🕷🦆🦆🌒🌖 → check the runs:\n\nLet's list the emojis:\n\n🌒, 🐃, 🎃, 🐃, 🦆, 🕷, 🦆, 🦆, 🌒, 🌖\n\nLooking for consecutive duplicates:\n\n🌒 is single.\n\n🐃 is single.\n\n🎃 single.\n\n🐃 single.\n\n🦆 single.\n\n🕷 single.\n\n🦆🦆 (positions 6 and 7) → run of 2 → count +=1.\n\nThen 🌒, 🌖 → no.\n\nSo row 1 contributes 1.\n\nRow 2: 🐫🐫🐃🌔🌖🌖🌒🌖🦆🐫\n\nEmojis: 🐫, 🐫, 🐃, 🌔, 🌖, 🌖, 🌒, 🌖, 🦆, 🐫\n\nRuns:\n\n🐫🐫 → 2 → count +=1.\n\nThen 🌖🌖 → run → count +=1.\n\nSo row 2 contributes 2.\n\nRow 3: 🎃🦆🌔🎃🌖🌒🐫🐃🌖🌖\n\nEmojis: 🎃, 🦆, 🌔, 🎃, 🌖, 🌒, 🐫, 🐃, 🌖, 🌖.\n\nLooking for runs:\n\n🌖🌖 at positions 8 and 9 → run of 2 → count +=1.\n\nOther emojis are single. So row 3 contributes 1.\n\nRow4: 🕷🐃🐃🌔🦆🐫🕷🐫🎃🐃\n\nEmojis: 🕷, 🐃, 🐃, 🌔, 🦆, 🐫, 🕷, 🐫, 🎃, 🐃.\n\nRuns:\n\n🐃🐃 (positions 1-2) → run → count +=1.\n\nSo row4 contributes 1.\n\nRow5: 🌒🐫🎃🎃🐫🌒🎃🕷🎃🌖\n\nEmojis: 🌒, 🐫, 🎃, 🎃, 🐫, 🌒, 🎃, 🕷, 🎃, 🌖.\n\nRuns:\n\n🎃🎃 (positions 2-3) → run of 2 → count +=1.\n\nOther emojis: 🐫 is single, 🎃 at position 8 is single. So row5 contributes 1.\n\nRow6: 🦆🐫🌔🕷🌔🦆🌔🦆🦆🌖\n\nEmojis: 🦆, 🐫, 🌔, 🕷, 🌔, 🦆, 🌔, 🦆, 🦆, 🌖.\n\nLooking for runs:\n\nThe last two 🦆s (positions 8 and 9? Wait, positions 8 and 9? Let's index from 0 to 9.\n\nPositions 7: 🦆, 8: 🦆, 9: 🌖.\n\nWait, positions 7-8 are 🦆🦆 (positions 7 and 8). So that's a run of 2 → count +=1.\n\nOther emojis: in positions 4 (🌔) and 5 (🦆), no. So row6 contributes 1.\n\nRow7: 🎃🎃🎃🌒🕷🌖🌒🐃🌒🌒\n\nEmojis: 🎃, 🎃, 🎃, 🌒, 🕷, 🌖, 🌒, 🐃, 🌒, 🌒.\n\nRuns:\n\nThe first three 🎃s (positions 0-2) → run of 3 → count +=1.\n\nThen, at the end: 🌒🌒 (positions 8-9) → run of 2 → count +=1.\n\nSo row7 contributes 2.\n\nRow8: 🌒🐫🐫🐃🕷🕷🐃🕷🐃🕷\n\nEmojis: 🌒, 🐫, 🐫, 🐃, 🕷, 🕷, 🐃, 🕷, 🐃, 🕷.\n\nRuns:\n\n🐫🐫 (positions 1-2) → run → count +=1.\n\n🕷🕷 (positions 4-5) → run → count +=1.\n\nSo row8 contributes 2.\n\nRow9: 🦆🌔🐃🌔🌔🐫🌒🎃🎃🌒\n\nEmojis: 🦆, 🌔, 🐃, 🌔, 🌔, 🐫, 🌒, 🎃, 🎃, 🌒.\n\nRuns:\n\n🌔🌔 (positions 3-4) → run of 2 → count +=1.\n\n🎃🎃 (positions 7-8) → run of 2 → count +=1.\n\nSo row9 contributes 2.\n\nNow, summing up the rows' contributions:\n\nRow0: 2 → total rows: 2\n\nRow1:1 → total rows:3\n\nRow2:2 →5\n\nRow3:1 →6\n\nRow4:1 →7\n\nRow5:1 →8\n\nRow6:1 →9\n\nRow7:2 →11\n\nRow8:2 →13\n\nRow9:2 →15.\n\nSo rows contribute 15.\n\nNow, need to process all the columns. There are 10 columns (0-9).\n\nLet's go column by column.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nEmojis from rows 0-9, position 0:\n\nRow0: 🎃\n\nRow1: 🌒\n\nRow2: 🐫\n\nRow3: 🎃\n\nRow4: 🕷\n\nRow5: 🌒\n\nRow6: 🦆\n\nRow7: 🎃\n\nRow8: 🌒\n\nRow9: 🦆\n\nLooking for consecutive same in vertical line:\n\nCheck each pair (row i, row i+1) in column 0.\n\nRow0-1: 🎃 vs 🌒 → different.\n\nRow1-2: 🌒 vs 🐫 → different.\n\nRow2-3: 🐫 vs 🎃 → different.\n\nRow3-4: 🎃 vs 🕷 → different.\n\nRow4-5: 🕷 vs 🌒 → different.\n\nRow5-6: 🌒 vs 🦆 → different.\n\nRow6-7: 🦆 vs 🎃 → different.\n\nRow7-8: 🎃 vs 🌒 → different.\n\nRow8-9: 🌒 vs 🦆 → different.\n\nNo consecutive runs. So column 0 contributes 0.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nEmojis:\n\nRow0: 🦆\n\nRow1: 🐃\n\nRow2: 🐫\n\nRow3: 🦆\n\nRow4: 🐃\n\nRow5: 🐫\n\nRow6: 🐫\n\nRow7: 🎃\n\nRow8: 🐫\n\nRow9: 🌔\n\nCheck vertical runs:\n\nCheck each pair:\n\nRow0-1: 🦆🐃 → different.\n\nRow1-2: 🐃🐫 → different.\n\nRow2-3: 🐫🦆 → different.\n\nRow3-4: 🦆🐃 → different.\n\nRow4-5: 🐃🐫 → different.\n\nRow5-6: 🐫🐫 → same → start a run. Let's see how long this run is.\n\nRow5: 🐫, row6: 🐫 → run starts. Then check row7: 🎃 → so the run is two (positions 5 and 6). So contributes 1.\n\nRow6-7: 🐫🎃 → different.\n\nRow7-8: 🎃🐫 → different.\n\nRow8-9: 🐫🌔 → different.\n\nSo column1 has one run (positions 5-6). So column1 contributes 1.\n\nColumn2:\n\nEmojis (position 2 for each row):\n\nRow0: 🦆\n\nRow1: 🎃\n\nRow2: 🐃\n\nRow3: 🌔\n\nRow4: 🐃\n\nRow5: 🎃\n\nRow6: 🌔\n\nRow7: 🎃\n\nRow8: 🐫\n\nRow9: 🐃\n\nCheck consecutive pairs:\n\nRow0-1: 🦆 vs 🎃 → different.\n\nRow1-2: 🎃 vs 🐃 → different.\n\nRow2-3: 🐃 vs 🌔 → different.\n\nRow3-4: 🌔 vs 🐃 → different.\n\nRow4-5: 🐃 vs 🎃 → different.\n\nRow5-6: 🎃 vs 🌔 → different.\n\nRow6-7: 🌔 vs 🎃 → different.\n\nRow7-8: 🎃 vs 🐫 → different.\n\nRow8-9: 🐫 vs 🐃 → different.\n\nNo runs. Column2 contributes 0.\n\nColumn3:\n\nEmojis (position3 of each row):\n\nRow0: 🐃\n\nRow1: 🐃\n\nRow2: 🌔\n\nRow3: 🎃\n\nRow4: 🌔\n\nRow5: 🐫\n\nRow6: 🕷\n\nRow7: 🌒\n\nRow8: 🐃\n\nRow9: 🌔\n\nCheck consecutive pairs:\n\nRow0-1: 🐃🐃 → same. Let's see if this extends.\n\nRow0:3 is 🐃, row1:3 is 🐃 → run starts. Then check row2:3 is 🌔. So run is 2 (rows0-1). So count +=1.\n\nRow1-2: 🐃 vs 🌔 → different.\n\nRow2-3: 🌔 vs 🎃 → different.\n\nRow3-4: 🎃 vs 🌔 → different.\n\nRow4-5: 🌔 vs 🐫 → different.\n\nRow5-6: 🐫 vs 🕷 → different.\n\nRow6-7: 🕷 vs 🌒 → different.\n\nRow7-8: 🌒 vs 🐃 → different.\n\nRow8-9: 🐃 vs 🌔 → different.\n\nSo column3 has one run (rows0-1) → contributes 1.\n\nColumn4:\n\nEmojis (position4):\n\nRow0: 🕷\n\nRow1: 🦆\n\nRow2: 🌖\n\nRow3: 🌖\n\nRow4: 🦆\n\nRow5: 🌒\n\nRow6: 🌔\n\nRow7: 🕷\n\nRow8: 🕷\n\nRow9: 🌔\n\nCheck consecutive pairs:\n\nRow0-1: 🕷 vs 🦆 → different.\n\nRow1-2: 🦆 vs 🌖 → different.\n\nRow2-3: 🌖 vs 🌖 → same. Run starts here. Let's see how long.\n\nRow2:4 → 🌖, row3:4 → 🌖 → run of 2. So count +=1.\n\nRow3-4: 🌖 vs 🦆 → different.\n\nRow4-5: 🦆 vs 🌒 → different.\n\nRow5-6: 🌒 vs 🌔 → different.\n\nRow6-7: 🌔 vs 🕷 → different.\n\nRow7-8: 🕷 vs 🕷 → same. Run of 2. So count +=1.\n\nRow8-9: 🕷 vs 🌔 → different.\n\nSo column4 has two runs: rows2-3 (🌖🌖) and rows7-8 (🕷🕷). So column4 contributes 2.\n\nColumn5 (position5):\n\nEmojis:\n\nRow0: 🌔\n\nRow1: 🕷\n\nRow2: 🌖\n\nRow3: 🌒\n\nRow4: 🐫\n\nRow5: 🎃\n\nRow6: 🦆\n\nRow7: 🌖\n\nRow8: 🕷\n\nRow9: 🐫\n\nCheck pairs:\n\nRow0-1: 🌔 vs 🕷 → different.\n\nRow1-2: 🕷 vs 🌖 → different.\n\nRow2-3: 🌖 vs 🌒 → different.\n\nRow3-4: 🌒 vs 🐫 → different.\n\nRow4-5: 🐫 vs 🎃 → different.\n\nRow5-6: 🎃 vs 🦆 → different.\n\nRow6-7: 🦆 vs 🌖 → different.\n\nRow7-8: 🌖 vs 🕷 → different.\n\nRow8-9: 🕷 vs 🐫 → different.\n\nNo runs. Column5 contributes 0.\n\nColumn6 (position6):\n\nEmojis:\n\nRow0: 🦆\n\nRow1: 🦆\n\nRow2: 🌒\n\nRow3: 🐫\n\nRow4: 🕷\n\nRow5: 🎃\n\nRow6: 🌔\n\nRow7: 🌒\n\nRow8: 🐃\n\nRow9: 🌒\n\nCheck consecutive pairs:\n\nRow0-1: 🦆 vs 🦆 → same. So run starts here.\n\nRow0:6 is 🦆, row1:6 is 🦆 → run of 2. Count +=1.\n\nRow1-2: 🦆 vs 🌒 → different.\n\nRow2-3: 🌒 vs 🐫 → different.\n\nRow3-4: 🐫 vs 🕷 → different.\n\nRow4-5: 🕷 vs 🎃 → different.\n\nRow5-6: 🎃 vs 🌔 → different.\n\nRow6-7: 🌔 vs 🌒 → different.\n\nRow7-8: 🌒 vs 🐃 → different.\n\nRow8-9: 🐃 vs 🌒 → different.\n\nSo column6 has one run (rows0-1) → contributes 1.\n\nColumn7 (position7):\n\nEmojis:\n\nRow0: 🕷\n\nRow1: 🦆\n\nRow2: 🌖\n\nRow3: 🐃\n\nRow4: 🐫\n\nRow5: 🕷\n\nRow6: 🦆\n\nRow7: 🐃\n\nRow8: 🕷\n\nRow9: 🎃\n\nCheck pairs:\n\nRow0-1: 🕷 vs 🦆 → different.\n\nRow1-2: 🦆 vs 🌖 → different.\n\nRow2-3: 🌖 vs 🐃 → different.\n\nRow3-4: 🐃 vs 🐫 → different.\n\nRow4-5: 🐫 vs 🕷 → different.\n\nRow5-6: 🕷 vs 🦆 → different.\n\nRow6-7: 🦆 vs 🐃 → different.\n\nRow7-8: 🐃 vs 🕷 → different.\n\nRow8-9: 🕷 vs 🎃 → different.\n\nNo runs. Column7 contributes 0.\n\nColumn8 (position8):\n\nEmojis:\n\nRow0: 🎃\n\nRow1: 🌒\n\nRow2: 🦆\n\nRow3: 🌖\n\nRow4: 🎃\n\nRow5: 🎃\n\nRow6: 🦆\n\nRow7: 🌒\n\nRow8: 🐃\n\nRow9: 🎃\n\nCheck pairs:\n\nRow0-1: 🎃 vs 🌒 → different.\n\nRow1-2: 🌒 vs 🦆 → different.\n\nRow2-3: 🦆 vs 🌖 → different.\n\nRow3-4: 🌖 vs 🎃 → different.\n\nRow4-5: 🎃 vs 🎃 → same. Run starts here. Let's check:\n\nRow4:8 is 🎃, row5:8 is 🎃 → run of 2 → count +=1.\n\nRow5-6: 🎃 vs 🦆 → different.\n\nRow6-7: 🦆 vs 🌒 → different.\n\nRow7-8: 🌒 vs 🐃 → different.\n\nRow8-9: 🐃 vs 🎃 → different.\n\nSo column8 has one run (rows4-5) → contributes 1.\n\nColumn9 (position9):\n\nEmojis:\n\nRow0: 🌔\n\nRow1: 🌖\n\nRow2: 🐫\n\nRow3: 🌖\n\nRow4: 🐃\n\nRow5: 🌖\n\nRow6: 🌖\n\nRow7: 🌒\n\nRow8: 🕷\n\nRow9: 🌒\n\nCheck consecutive pairs:\n\nRow0-1: 🌔 vs 🌖 → different.\n\nRow1-2: 🌖 vs 🐫 → different.\n\nRow2-3: 🐫 vs 🌖 → different.\n\nRow3-4: 🌖 vs 🐃 → different.\n\nRow4-5: 🐃 vs 🌖 → different.\n\nRow5-6: 🌖 vs 🌖 → same. Run of 2 → count +=1.\n\nRow6-7: 🌖 vs 🌒 → different.\n\nRow7-8: 🌒 vs 🕷 → different.\n\nRow8-9: 🕷 vs 🌒 → different.\n\nSo column9 has one run (rows5-6: 🌖🌖) → contributes 1.\n\nNow, summing up columns:\n\nColumn0: 0\n\nColumn1:1 → total 1\n\nColumn2:0 → 1\n\nColumn3:1 →2\n\nColumn4:2 →4\n\nColumn5:0 →4\n\nColumn6:1 →5\n\nColumn7:0 →5\n\nColumn8:1 →6\n\nColumn9:1 →7.\n\nWait, column9 contributes 1 → total columns would be 3 (column3:1, column4:2, column6:1, column8:1, column9:1). Wait, let me recount.\n\nWait, columns:\n\nColumn0:0\n\nColumn1:1 → sum 1\n\nColumn2:0 → sum remains 1\n\nColumn3:1 → sum 2\n\nColumn4:2 → sum 4\n\nColumn5:0 → sum 4\n\nColumn6:1 → sum 5\n\nColumn7:0 → sum 5\n\nColumn8:1 → sum 6\n\nColumn9:1 → sum 7.\n\nSo the total columns contribute 7.\n\nSo rows contribute 15, columns contribute 7. Total lines: 15 +7=22.\n\nBut wait, that seems low. Let me double-check the columns.\n\nWait, let's re-examine some columns.\n\nFor column3:\n\nRun at rows0 and1 (both 🐃). Then rows2 is 🌔, so no further. So that's a run of 2 → count +=1.\n\nYes.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow4's position4 is 🦆, row5's position4 is 🌒 → different. So the first run is rows2-3 (🌖🌖). Then rows7-8 (🕷🕷). So two runs.\n\nYes.\n\nColumn6:\n\nRow0 and1 (position6) are both 🦆? Let me check.\n\nWait, column6 is position6. Row0's position6 is 🦆 (row0's emojis are positions 0-9: 🎃, 🦆, 🦆, 🐃, 🕷, 🌔, 🌔, 🦆, 🕷, 🌔 → so position6 is 🌔? Wait, wait, no. Let me list row0 again.\n\nRow0: 🎃 (0) 🦆(1) 🦆(2) 🐃(3) 🕷(4) 🌔(5) 🌔(6) 🦆(7) 🕷(8) 🌔(9)\n\nAh, right. So position6 in row0 is 🌔 (6th emoji, indexes 0-9). Then row1's position6 is 🦆? Let's check row1.\n\nRow1: 🌒(0) 🐃(1) 🎃(2) 🐃(3) 🦆(4) 🕷(5) 🦆(6) 🦆(7) 🌒(8) 🌖(9). So position6 is 🦆.\n\nWait, no. Wait, row1's position6 is the seventh element (since indexes are 0-based). So row1's elements are:\n\n0:🌒, 1:🐃, 2:🎃, 3:🐃,4:🦆,5:🕷,6:🦆,7:🦆,8:🌒,9:🌖.\n\nSo row1's position6 is 🦆.\n\nSo column6 (position6) for row0 is 🌔, row1 is 🦆 → different. So the first pair (row0 and row1) in column6 is 🌔 and 🦆 → different. Then how did I get a run in column6?\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let's recheck column6.\n\nColumn6 (position6) emojis:\n\nRow0: 🌔 (position6)\n\nRow1: 🦆 (position6)\n\nRow2: position6 in row2. Let's see row2:\n\nRow2: 🐫(0) 🐫(1) 🐃(2) 🌔(3) 🌖(4) 🌖(5) 🌒(6) 🌖(7) 🦆(8) 🐫(9). So position6 is 🌒.\n\nRow3's position6: row3's elements are:\n\n🎃(0) 🦆(1) 🌔(2) 🎃(3) 🌖(4) 🌒(5) 🐫(6) 🐃(7) 🌖(8) 🌖(9). So position6 is 🐫.\n\nRow4's position6: row4's emojis are:\n\n🕷(0) 🐃(1) 🐃(2) 🌔(3) 🦆(4) 🐫(5) 🕷(6) 🐫(7) 🎃(8) 🐃(9). So position6 is 🕷.\n\nRow5's position6: row5's emojis are:\n\n🌒(0) 🐫(1) 🎃(2) 🎃(3) 🐫(4) 🌒(5) 🎃(6) 🕷(7) 🎃(8) 🌖(9). Position6 is 🎃.\n\nRow6's position6: row6's emojis are:\n\n🦆(0) 🐫(1) 🌔(2) 🕷(3) 🌔(4) 🦆(5) 🌔(6) 🦆(7) 🦆(8) 🌖(9). Position6 is 🌔.\n\nRow7's position6: row7's emojis are:\n\n🎃(0) 🎃(1) 🎃(2) 🌒(3) 🕷(4) 🌖(5) 🌒(6) 🐃(7) 🌒(8) 🌒(9). Position6 is 🌒.\n\nRow8's position6: row8's emojis are:\n\n🌒(0) 🐫(1) 🐫(2) 🐃(3) 🕷(4) 🕷(5) 🐃(6) 🕷(7) 🐃(8) 🕷(9). Position6 is 🐃.\n\nRow9's position6: row9's emojis are:\n\n🦆(0) 🌔(1) 🐃(2) 🌔(3) 🌔(4) 🐫(5) 🌒(6) 🎃(7) 🎃(8) 🌒(9). Position6 is 🌒.\n\nSo column6's emojis are:\n\nRow0: 🌔\n\nRow1: 🦆\n\nRow2: 🌒\n\nRow3: 🐫\n\nRow4: 🕷\n\nRow5: 🎃\n\nRow6: 🌔\n\nRow7: 🌒\n\nRow8: 🐃\n\nRow9: 🌒\n\nNow check consecutive pairs in this column:\n\nRow0-1: 🌔 vs 🦆 → different.\n\nRow1-2: 🦆 vs 🌒 → different.\n\nRow2-3: 🌒 vs 🐫 → different.\n\nRow3-4: 🐫 vs 🕷 → different.\n\nRow4-5: 🕷 vs 🎃 → different.\n\nRow5-6: 🎃 vs 🌔 → different.\n\nRow6-7: 🌔 vs 🌒 → different.\n\nRow7-8: 🌒 vs 🐃 → different.\n\nRow8-9: 🐃 vs 🌒 → different.\n\nSo column6 has no runs. So my earlier analysis was wrong. So column6 contributes 0, not 1. That's a mistake.\n\nSo that reduces the columns' total by 1. So columns contribution is 6 (previous sum was 7, but column6 is actually 0).\n\nWait, where did I go wrong earlier? Let me recheck.\n\nEarlier, I thought column6's emojis were:\n\nRow0: 🦆 (position6) → but no, in row0, position6 is 🌔. So previous analysis for column6 was incorrect. So column6 has no runs. So column6 contributes 0. Thus the previous columns sum was 7-1=6.\n\nSo columns contribute 6.\n\nLet me re-examine column6 correctly.\n\nSo columns:\n\nColumn6 has no runs. So columns contribution is:\n\nColumn0:0\n\nColumn1:1 →1\n\nColumn2:0 →1\n\nColumn3:1 →2\n\nColumn4:2 →4\n\nColumn5:0 →4\n\nColumn6:0 →4\n\nColumn7:0 →4\n\nColumn8:1 →5\n\nColumn9:1 →6.\n\nSo columns contribute 6.\n\nSo rows contributed 15, columns contributed6 → total 21.\n\nBut wait, let's recheck columns again.\n\nLet me go through each column again properly.\n\nColumn0: 0.\n\nColumn1: Check the pairs. Row5 and 6 (positions1) were 🐫 and 🐫. So that's a run of 2 → count +=1. Others are different. So column1 contributes 1.\n\nColumn2: 0.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRows0 and1 (position3) are 🐃 and 🐃 → run of 2. So count +=1. Other pairs are different. So column3 contributes 1.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRows2-3 (position4) → 🌖 and 🌖 → run of 2 → count +=1.\n\nRows7-8 (position4) → 🕷 and 🕷 → run of 2 → count +=1. So total 2.\n\nColumn5: 0.\n\nColumn6: 0.\n\nColumn7:0.\n\nColumn8:\n\nRows4 and5 (position8) → 🎃 and 🎃 → run of 2 → count +=1.\n\nOther pairs are different.\n\nColumn9:\n\nRows5 and6 (position9) → 🌖 and 🌖 → run of 2 → count +=1.\n\nSo column9 contributes 1.\n\nSo columns contribute 1 (column1) +1 (column3) +2 (column4) +1 (column8) +1 (column9) → total 6.\n\nYes.\n\nSo total lines: rows (15) + columns (6) =21.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in rows.\n\nLet me recheck the rows.\n\nRow7: 🎃🎃🎃🌒🕷🌖🌒🐃🌒🌒\n\nEmojis: 🎃, 🎃, 🎃, 🌒, 🕷, 🌖, 🌒, 🐃, 🌒, 🌒.\n\nThe runs are:\n\nFirst three 🎃s → run of 3 → count +=1.\n\nThen at the end, 🌒 and 🌒 → run of 2 → count +=1. So row7 contributes 2.\n\nRow8: 🌒🐫🐫🐃🕷🕷🐃🕷🐃🕷\n\nEmojis: 🌒, 🐫, 🐫, 🐃, 🕷, 🕷, 🐃, 🕷, 🐃, 🕷.\n\nRuns: 🐫🐫 (run of 2), 🕷🕷 (run of 2) → count +=2. So row8 contributes 2.\n\nRow9: 🦆🌔🐃🌔🌔🐫🌒🎃🎃🌒\n\nEmojis: 🦆, 🌔, 🐃, 🌔, 🌔, 🐫, 🌒, 🎃, 🎃, 🌒.\n\nRuns: 🌔🌔 (positions3-4) and 🎃🎃 (positions7-8) → count +=2. So row9 contributes 2.\n\nSo rows sum:\n\nRow0:2 →2\n\nRow1:1 →3\n\nRow2:2 →5\n\nRow3:1 →6\n\nRow4:1 →7\n\nRow5:1 →8\n\nRow6:1 →9\n\nRow7:2 →11\n\nRow8:2 →13\n\nRow9:2 →15.\n\nYes, rows sum is 15.\n\nColumns sum is 6. So total lines 21.\n\nBut wait, when I first did the columns, I thought columns contributed 6. But I'm not sure. Let me check column8 again.\n\nColumn8:\n\nEmojis (position8) for each row:\n\nRow0: 🎃 (row0's emojis are: 🎃, 🦆, 🦆, 🐃, 🕷, 🌔, 🌔, 🦆, 🕷, 🌔 → position8 is 🕷. Wait, position8 is index8. So row0's position8 is 🕷.\n\nRow1: position8 is 🌒.\n\nRow2: position8 is 🦆.\n\nRow3: position8 is 🌖.\n\nRow4: position8 is 🎃.\n\nRow5: position8 is 🎃.\n\nRow6: position8 is 🦆.\n\nRow7: position8 is 🌒.\n\nRow8: position8 is 🐃.\n\nRow9: position8 is 🎃.\n\nSo column8's emojis are:\n\nRow0: 🕷\n\nRow1: 🌒\n\nRow2: 🦆\n\nRow3: 🌖\n\nRow4: 🎃\n\nRow5: 🎃\n\nRow6: 🦆\n\nRow7: 🌒\n\nRow8: 🐃\n\nRow9: 🎃\n\nCheck consecutive pairs:\n\nRow0-1: 🕷 vs 🌒 → different.\n\nRow1-2: 🌒 vs 🦆 → different.\n\nRow2-3: 🦆 vs 🌖 → different.\n\nRow3-4: 🌖 vs 🎃 → different.\n\nRow4-5: 🎃 vs 🎃 → same → run of 2. So count +=1.\n\nRow5-6: 🎃 vs 🦆 → different.\n\nRow6-7: 🦆 vs 🌒 → different.\n\nRow7-8: 🌒 vs 🐃 → different.\n\nRow8-9: 🐃 vs 🎃 → different.\n\nSo column8 contributes 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the columns' sum is 1 (column1) +1 (column3) +2 (column4) +1 (column8) +1 (column9) → total 6.\n\nSo rows (15) + columns (6) =21. So the answer is 21?\n\nBut I have to make sure that I haven't missed any runs in the columns.\n\nLet me recheck column9.\n\nColumn9 (position9):\n\nEmojis from each row:\n\nRow0: 🌔 (position9)\n\nRow1: 🌖\n\nRow2: 🐫\n\nRow3: 🌖\n\nRow4: 🐃\n\nRow5: 🌖\n\nRow6: 🌖\n\nRow7: 🌒\n\nRow8: 🕷\n\nRow9: 🌒.\n\nCheck pairs:\n\nRow0-1: 🌔 vs 🌖 → different.\n\nRow1-2: 🌖 vs 🐫 → different.\n\nRow2-3: 🐫 vs 🌖 → different.\n\nRow3-4: 🌖 vs 🐃 → different.\n\nRow4-5: 🐃 vs 🌖 → different.\n\nRow5-6: 🌖 vs 🌖 → same. Run of 2 → count +=1.\n\nRow6-7: 🌖 vs 🌒 → different.\n\nRow7-8: 🌒 vs 🕷 → different.\n\nRow8-9: 🕷 vs 🌒 → different.\n\nSo column9 contributes 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo columns sum to 6.\n\nSo total lines:15+6=21. So Answer: 21.\n\nBut wait, I'm not confident. Let me check another column.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRows0-9, position4:\n\nRow0: 🕷 (position4)\n\nRow1: 🦆\n\nRow2: 🌖\n\nRow3: 🌖\n\nRow4: 🦆\n\nRow5: 🌒\n\nRow6: 🌔\n\nRow7: 🕷\n\nRow8: 🕷\n\nRow9: 🌔.\n\nCheck pairs:\n\nRow0: 🕷, row1: 🦆 → different.\n\nRow1: 🦆, row2: 🌖 → different.\n\nRow2: 🌖, row3: 🌖 → same → run of 2 → count +=1.\n\nRow3: 🌖, row4: 🦆 → different.\n\nRow4: 🦆, row5: 🌒 → different.\n\nRow5: 🌒, row6: 🌔 → different.\n\nRow6: 🌔, row7: 🕷 → different.\n\nRow7: 🕷, row8: 🕷 → same → run of 2 → count +=1.\n\nRow8: 🕷, row9: 🌔 → different.\n\nSo column4 contributes 2 → correct.\n\nSo yes, columns total 6.\n\nI think my final count is 21.\n\n\nThe task is to count horizontal and vertical lines of the same emoji with a length of 2 or more. For each row and column, consecutive runs of the same emoji contribute 1 per run if their length is ≥2. \n\n**Rows Analysis:**\n- **Row 0**: 2 runs (🦆🦆, 🌔🌔) → 2\n- **Row 1**: 1 run (🦆🦆) → 1\n- **Row 2**: 2 runs (🐫🐫, 🌖🌖) → 2\n- **Row 3**: 1 run (🌖🌖) → 1\n- **Row 4**: 1 run (🐃🐃) → 1\n- **Row 5**: 1 run (🎃🎃) → 1\n- **Row 6**: 1 run (🦆🦆) → 1\n- **Row 7**: 2 runs (🎃🎃🎃, 🌒🌒) → 2\n- **Row 8**: 2 runs (🐫🐫, 🕷🕷) → 2\n- **Row 9**: 2 runs (🌔🌔, 🎃🎃) → 2  \n**Total rows: 15**\n\n**Columns Analysis:**\n- **Column 1**: 1 run (🐫🐫) → 1\n- **Column 3**: 1 run (🐃🐃) → 1\n- **Column 4**: 2 runs (🌖🌖, 🕷🕷) → 2\n- **Column 8**: 1 run (🎃🎃) → 1\n- **Column 9**: 1 run (🌖🌖) → 1  \n**Total columns: 6**\n\n**Final Calculation:**  \nTotal lines = Rows (15) + Columns (6) = **21**\n\nAnswer: 21"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines of the same emoji that are length 2 or more. So each line (horizontal row or vertical column) might have multiple such sequences. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the board is made up of emojis arranged in a grid. From the given input, there are 6 rows and 6 columns. Let me write out the board to visualize it better.\n\nRow 0: 🎄🦊🦊🎄🐐🐧\nRow 1: 🦊🐐🎄🎄🐧🦊\nRow 2: 🐐🐐🦊🐧🐧🎄\nRow 3: 🎄🎄🐧🦊🐧🐐\nRow 4: 🦊🎄🎄🐐🐧🐐\nRow 5: 🎄🎄🐧🐧🐧🐧\n\nNow, I need to check each row for consecutive emojis. Then do the same for each column. For each line (row or column), count sequences of the same emoji that are 2 or longer. Each such sequence contributes 1 to the total count. But wait, sequences longer than 2 count as one line each. Like, a sequence of 3 in a row would be one line. Or wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So for example, in a horizontal row, if there's a run of 3 same emojis, that's a single line of length 3. So each run of 2 or more in a row or column counts as one line. So for example, a horizontal line of 2 is one, a line of 3 is one, etc.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor each row:\n- Split the row into runs of consecutive same emojis. For each run, if the length is >=2, add 1 to the count.\n\nFor each column:\n- Do the same. Split into consecutive runs, and for each run of length >=2, add 1.\n\nSum all these counts for rows and columns.\n\nSo let's start with rows.\n\nRow 0: [🎄], [🦊,🦊], [🎄], [🐐], [🐧]. So the runs here are of lengths 1,2,1,1,1. Only the second run (two 🦊) counts. So +1 for rows.\n\nRow 1: [🦊], [🐐], [🎄,🎄], [🐧], [🦊]. The third run is two 🎄. So +1 for rows here.\n\nRow 2: [🐐,🐐], [🦊], [🐧,🐧], [🎄]. The first run (two 🐐) and third run (two 🐧) each contribute. So +2 for this row.\n\nRow 3: [🎄,🎄], [🐧], [🦊], [🐧], [🐐]. First run (two 🎄). So +1.\n\nRow 4: [🦊], [🎄,🎄], [🐐], [🐧], [🐐]. The second run (two 🎄). So +1.\n\nRow 5: [🎄,🎄], [🐧,🐧,🐧,🐧]. First run (two 🎄), second run (four 🐧). Both contribute. So +2 for this row.\n\nTotal for rows: 1 + 1 + 2 +1 +1 +2 = 8.\n\nNow columns. Let's check each column from 0 to 5.\n\nColumn 0:\nRows 0-5: 🎄, 🦊, 🐐, 🎄, 🦊, 🎄.\n\nCheck the runs:\n\nRow0: 🎄\nRow1: 🦊 (different)\nRow2: 🐐 (different)\nRow3: 🎄 (different)\nRow4: 🦊 (different)\nRow5: 🎄 (different)\nSo all are single. No runs here. So 0.\n\nWait, wait. Column 0 is the first element of each row. So:\n\nColumn 0 elements: [🎄, 🦊, 🐐, 🎄, 🦊, 🎄]. Let's see if there are any consecutive runs. Let's list them:\n\nRow0: 🎄 (column 0)\nRow1: 🦊 (diff)\nRow2: 🐐 (diff)\nRow3: 🎄 (diff)\nRow4: 🦊 (diff)\nRow5: 🎄 (diff)\n\nSo each is a single element. So no runs in column 0.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow0: 🦊\nRow1: 🐐\nRow2: 🐐\nRow3: 🎄\nRow4: 🎄\nRow5: 🎄\n\nElements: [🦊, 🐐, 🐐, 🎄, 🎄, 🎄]\n\nCheck consecutive runs.\n\nStart at row0: 🦊. Next is row1: 🐐 (different). So one run of length 1.\n\nThen row1: 🐐, row2: 🐐. So run starts at row1, length 2. So that's a run of 2. Then row3 is 🎄 (different). So this run contributes +1.\n\nThen row3 is 🎄, row4 is 🎄. So another run of 2. Then row5 is 🎄. So that's a run of 3 (rows 3-5). Wait, wait: the sequence in column 1 is [🦊, 🐐, 🐐, 🎄, 🎄, 🎄].\n\nBreaking into runs:\n\nRow0: 🦊 (single)\nRow1: 🐐 (starts a new run. Then row2: same, so run is row1-2 (length 2). Then row3: 🎄 (new run. Then row4-5: same as row3. So run from row3 to row5, length 3.\n\nSo column1 has two runs: the row1-2 (length 2) and row3-5 (length 3). So each contributes 1. So column1 gives +2.\n\nWait, but how do I split the runs? Let's redo column1 step by step.\n\nElements in column1 (index 1) for each row:\n\n0: 🦊\n\n1: 🐐\n\n2: 🐐\n\n3: 🎄\n\n4: 🎄\n\n5: 🎄\n\nSo list: 🦊, 🐐, 🐐, 🎄, 🎄, 🎄.\n\nProcessing consecutive elements:\n\nStart with index 0 (🦊). Next is index 1 (🐐). Different. So run is length 1.\n\nThen index1 (🐐) and index2 (🐐): same. So run starts at index1, length 2. Then index3 (🎄) is different. So run of 2. Contributes 1.\n\nNow index3 (🎄), index4 (🎄), index5 (🎄). All same. So run from 3 to 5, length 3. Contributes another 1.\n\nSo column1 has 2 runs. So column1 contributes 2.\n\nSo column1: 2.\n\nColumn2:\n\nElements:\n\nRow0: 🦊\n\nRow1: 🎄\n\nRow2: 🦊\n\nRow3: 🧊 (wait, no. Let me check again. Wait, column2 for each row:\n\nRow0: column2 is 🦊 (third emoji in first row: index 2 is 🦊)\n\nRow1: column2 is 🎄 (third emoji in second row: index 2 is 🎄)\n\nRow2: column2 is 🦊 (third emoji in third row: 🦊)\n\nRow3: column2 is 🐧 (third emoji in fourth row: 🐧)\n\nRow4: column2 is 🎄 (third emoji in fifth row: 🎄)\n\nRow5: column2 is 🐧 (third emoji in sixth row: 🐧)\n\nSo elements in column2:\n\nRow0: 🦊\n\nRow1: 🎄\n\nRow2: 🦊\n\nRow3: 🐧\n\nRow4: 🎄\n\nRow5: 🐧\n\nSo the sequence is 🦊, 🎄, 🦊, 🐧, 🎄, 🐧. All are different from their next element. So no runs. So column2: 0.\n\nColumn3:\n\nElements:\n\nRow0: 🎄 (column3)\n\nRow1: 🎄 (column3)\n\nRow2: 🧊 (row2, column3 is index3 which is 🐧)\n\nRow3: 🦊 (row3, column3)\n\nRow4: 🐐 (row4, column3)\n\nRow5: 🧊 (row5, column3 is index3 which is 🐧)\n\nSo elements:\n\nRow0: 🎄\n\nRow1: 🎄\n\nRow2: 🐧\n\nRow3: 🦊\n\nRow4: 🐐\n\nRow5: 🐧\n\nSo sequence: 🎄, 🎄, 🐧, 🦊, 🐐, 🐧.\n\nCheck for consecutive runs:\n\nRow0 and row1 are 🎄, 🎄: length 2. So contributes 1.\n\nThen row2 is 🐧 (different), row3 is 🦊 (different), etc. So column3 has 1 run (rows0-1). So +1.\n\nColumn4:\n\nElements:\n\nRow0: 🐐 (column4 is index4)\n\nRow1: 🐧 (column4, row1 is index4: 🐧)\n\nRow2: 🐧 (row2, column4 is 🐧)\n\nRow3: 🐧 (row3, column4 is 🐧)\n\nRow4: 🧊 (row4, column4 is 🐧)\n\nRow5: 🧊 (row5, column4 is 🐧)\n\nWait, let's list them:\n\nRow0: column4 is index4: 🐐.\n\nRow1: column4 is index4: 🐧.\n\nRow2: column4: 🐧.\n\nRow3: column4: 🐧.\n\nRow4: column4: 🐧.\n\nRow5: column4: 🐧.\n\nSo sequence: 🐐, 🐧, 🐧, 🐧, 🐧, 🐧.\n\nLooking for consecutive runs:\n\nRow0: 🐐. Next is row1: 🐧 (diff). So run of 1.\n\nThen row1: 🐧. row2: same. row3: same. etc. So from row1 to row5: a run of length 5. So this contributes +1. So column4 has 1 run (length 5).\n\nSo column4 contributes 1.\n\nColumn5:\n\nElements:\n\nRow0: 🐧 (column5, index5)\n\nRow1: 🦊 (row1, column5)\n\nRow2: 🎄 (row2, column5)\n\nRow3: 🐐 (row3, column5)\n\nRow4: 🐐 (row4, column5)\n\nRow5: 🧊 (row5, column5: 🐧).\n\nSo elements: 🐧, 🦊, 🎄, 🐐, 🐐, 🐧.\n\nCheck runs:\n\nRow4 and row5 (column5 elements):\n\nrow4: 🐐, row5: 🐧 (different). So in column5:\n\nRow0: 🐧 (single)\n\nRow1: 🦊 (single)\n\nRow2: 🎄 (single)\n\nRow3: 🐐 (single)\n\nRow4: 🐐 (starts a run. row5: 🐧. So run of 1 for row4. So the only possible run is row4-5? Wait, no. Let's process:\n\nThe sequence is [🐧, 🦊, 🎄, 🐐, 🐐, 🐧].\n\nLooking for consecutive same:\n\nRow3: 🐐. Row4: 🐐. Same. So run from row3 to row4 (length 2). Then row5 is different. So that's a run of 2. So contributes 1.\n\nOther elements: no. So column5 has 1 run.\n\nSo summing up the columns:\n\ncolumn0:0\n\ncolumn1:2\n\ncolumn2:0\n\ncolumn3:1\n\ncolumn4:1\n\ncolumn5:1\n\nTotal columns: 0+2+0+1+1+1=5.\n\nWait, wait. Let me recheck each column.\n\nWait column0: 0\n\ncolumn1: 2 runs (the 🐐 from row1-2 and 🎄 from row3-5). So 2.\n\ncolumn2: all different. 0.\n\ncolumn3: 🎄,🎄 in row0-1. So 1.\n\ncolumn4: from row1 to row5 (length5, which counts as 1 run.\n\ncolumn5: in row3-4, 🐐, 🐐. So 1 run.\n\nSo columns sum to 0+2+0+1+1+1=5.\n\nSo total lines from rows (8) and columns (5) gives 8+5=13.\n\nWait, but let me recheck the rows again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nRow0: two 🦊 →1\n\nRow1: two 🎄 →1\n\nRow2: two 🐐 and two 🐧 →2\n\nRow3: two 🎄 →1\n\nRow4: two 🎄 →1\n\nRow5: two 🎄 and four 🐧 (which counts as one run) →2.\n\nYes, 1+1=2 for row5. So rows total 1+1+2+1+1+2=8.\n\nColumns: 2+1+1+1=5. Wait 2 (col1) + 1 (col3) +1 (col4) +1 (col5) +0 (col0,2) → 2+1+1+1=5. Yes.\n\nSo total lines 8+5=13.\n\nHmm, but let me check the columns again.\n\nColumn4: the run is from row1 to row5 (5 elements?), but the first element is row0: 🐐. Then row1 is 🐧. So the run starts at row1 (🐧) and continues till row5. So that's 5 elements (row1-5: 5 elements?), but that's a run of length 5. So contributes 1.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be 13.\n\n\nAnswer: 13"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.
