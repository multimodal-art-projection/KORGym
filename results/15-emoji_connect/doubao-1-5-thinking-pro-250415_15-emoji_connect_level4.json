A line of length \\( L \\) (where \\( L \\geq 2 \\)) contributes \\( L-1 \\) such lines (since each consecutive pair in the sequence forms a line of length 2).\n\n### Step 1: Count Horizontal Lines\nWe examine each row to find consecutive runs of the same emoji and sum the contributions of these runs.\n\n- **Row 0**: `🎄🦊🦊🎄🐐🐧`  \n  Only one run of length 2 (`🦊🦊`). Contribution: \\( 2-1 = 1 \\).  \n- **Row 1**: `🦊🐐🎄🎄🐧🦊`  \n  Only one run of length 2 (`🎄🎄`). Contribution: \\( 2-1 = 1 \\).  \n- **Row 2**: `🐐🐐🦊🐧🐧🎄`  \n  Two runs of length 2 (`🐐🐐` and `🐧🐧`). Contribution: \\( (2-1) + (2-1) = 2 \\).  \n- **Row 3**: `🎄🎄🐧🦊🐧🐐`  \n  Only one run of length 2 (`🎄🎄`). Contribution: \\( 2-1 = 1 \\).  \n- **Row 4**: `🦊🎄🎄🐐🐧🐐`  \n  Only one run of length 2 (`🎄🎄`). Contribution: \\( 2-1 = 1 \\).  \n- **Row 5**: `🎄🎄🐧🐧🐧🐧`  \n  One run of length 2 (`🎄🎄`) and one run of length 4 (`🐧🐧🐧🐧`). Contribution: \\( (2-1) + (4-1) = 1 + 3 = 4 \\).  \n\nTotal horizontal lines: \\( 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 10 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Count Vertical Lines\nWe examine each column to find consecutive runs of the same emoji and sum the contributions of these runs.\n\n- **Column 0**: `🎄🦊🐐🎄🦊🎄`  \n  No runs of length ≥ 2. Contribution: \\( 0 \\).  \n- **Column 1**: `🦊🐐🐐🎄🎄🎄`  \n  One run of length 2 (`🐐🐐`) and one run of length 3 (`🎄🎄🎄`). Contribution: \\( (2-1) + (3-1) = 1 + 2 = 3 \\).  \n- **Column 2**: `🦊🎄🦊🐧🎄🐧`  \n  No runs of length ≥ 2. Contribution: \\( 0 \\).  \n- **Column 3**: `🎄🎄🐧🦊🐐🐧`  \n  One run of length 2 (`🎄🎄`). Contribution: \\( 2-1 = 1 \\).  \n- **Column 4**: `🐐🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧`  \n  One run of length 5 (`🐧🐧🐧🐧🐧`). Contribution: \\( 5-1 = 4 \\).  \n- **Column 5**: `🐧🦊🎄🐐🐐🐧`  \n  One run of length 2 (`🐐🐐`). Contribution: \\( 2-1 = 1 \\).  \n\nTotal vertical lines: \\( 0 + 3 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 9 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Total Lines\nAdding the horizontal and vertical contributions gives the final count: \\( 10 + 9 = 19 \\).\n\nAnswer: 19"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.
