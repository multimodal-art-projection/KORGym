The task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines of the same emoji with length 2 or more. Hmm, so first I need to check each row for horizontal sequences and each column for vertical sequences. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, right? Because there are 10 rows, each with 10 emojis. Let's confirm: each line in the input has 10 emojis. So rows are 0-9, columns 0-9.\n\nFor horizontal lines: For each row, we need to look for consecutive same emojis. For a sequence of length k (k >=2), how many lines does it contribute? For example, a sequence of length 2 contributes 1 line. A sequence of 3 contributes 2 lines (positions 0-1, 1-2). A sequence of 4 contributes 3 lines (0-1, 1-2, 2-3), etc. Because each line is a consecutive pair, and longer sequences have overlapping pairs. So the formula for a run of length L is (L-1) lines.\n\nSimilarly for vertical lines: check each column, look for consecutive same emojis, same calculation.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Iterate over each row, check for horizontal runs.\n2. For each row, process each position, track current emoji and current run length. When the emoji changes, calculate the number of lines from the previous run (if run length >=2, add (run_length -1) to total).\n3. Do the same for each column, check vertical runs.\n4. Sum all these to get the total.\n\nLet's start with horizontal processing. Let's list out each row and process them.\n\nRow 0: 🌼🐋🥀🚀🐚🚀🌳🐚🥀🚀\nLet's list each emoji in order:\n\n0: 🌼\n1: 🐋\n2: 🥀\n3: 🚀\n4: 🐚\n5: 🚀\n6: 🌳\n7: 🐚\n8: 🥀\n9: 🚀\n\nAll emojis are different from their next. So each consecutive pair is different. So row 0 contributes 0 horizontal lines.\n\nRow 1: 🐚🌳🌳🌼🐫🥀🌳🌼🦔🌼\nEmojis:\n0: 🐚\n1: 🌳 (same as next, 1 and 2 are 🌳)\n2: 🌳\n3: 🌼\n4: 🐫\n5: 🥀\n6: 🌳\n7: 🌼\n8: 🦔\n9: 🌼\n\nSo in row 1, the run is 🌳 at positions 1 and 2. Length 2. So contributes 1 line.\n\nRow 2: 🐋🥀🐫🐫🥀🐚🦩🥀🦩🌳\nEmojis:\n0: 🐋\n1: 🥀\n2: 🐫\n3: 🐫 (positions 2 and 3: same)\n4: 🥀\n5: 🐚\n6: 🦩\n7: 🥀\n8: 🦩\n9: 🌳\n\nRun of 🐫 at 2-3 (length 2). So contributes 1.\n\nRow 3: 🦔🦩🐫🌼🐋🌼🌳🐋🐋🐋\nEmojis:\n0: 🦔\n1: 🦩\n2: 🐫\n3: 🌼\n4: 🐋\n5: 🌼\n6: 🌳\n7: 🐋\n8: 🐋 (7,8,9 are 🐋)\n9: 🐋\n\nSo positions 7-8-9: three 🐋. Length 3. So contributes (3-1) = 2 lines. So 2.\n\nRow 4: 🚀🥀🐫🌳🌳🌼🥀🐫🌳🐚\nEmojis:\n0: 🚀\n1: 🥀\n2: 🐫\n3: 🌳\n4: 🌳 (3-4: same)\n5: 🌼\n6: 🥀\n7: 🐫\n8: 🌳\n9: 🐚\n\nRun of 🌳 at 3-4 (length 2). Contributes 1.\n\nRow 5: 🥀🐚🌳🥀🌼🥀🐋🥀🐚🐫\nEmojis:\n0: 🥀\n1: 🐚\n2: 🌳\n3: 🥀\n4: 🌼\n5: 🥀\n6: 🐋\n7: 🥀\n8: 🐚\n9: 🐫\n\nAll different consecutive. So 0.\n\nRow 6: 🌳🦔🌼🐋🐚🚀🐋🚀🦩🐚\nEmojis:\n0: 🌳\n1: 🦔\n2: 🌼\n3: 🐋\n4: 🐚\n5: 🚀\n6: 🐋\n7: 🚀\n8: 🦩\n9: 🐚\n\nNo consecutive duplicates. 0.\n\nRow 7: 🫧🌳🌳🚀🚀🦩🌳🥀🦔🥀 (Wait, original row 7 is \"🐫🌳🌳🚀🚀🦩🌳🥀🦔🥀\"\n\nAh, let's correct:\n\nRow 7: 🐫🌳🌳🚀🚀🦩🌳🥀🦔🥀\nEmojis:\n0: 🐫\n1: 🌳\n2: 🌳 (1-2: 🌳)\n3: 🚀\n4: 🚀 (3-4: 🚀)\n5: 🦩\n6: 🌳\n7: 🥀\n8: 🦔\n9: 🥀\n\nSo two runs here: 🌳 (length 2) contributes 1, 🚀 (length 2) contributes 1. Total 2.\n\nRow 8: 🐚🥀🐋🐋🦔🐚🐫🐫🌼🌳\nEmojis:\n0: 🐚\n1: 🥀\n2: 🐋\n3: 🐋 (2-3: 🐋)\n4: 🦔\n5: 🐚\n6: 🐫\n7: 🐫 (6-7: 🐫)\n8: 🌼\n9: 🌳\n\nTwo runs: 🐋 (length 2) →1, 🐫 (length 2) →1. Total 2.\n\nRow 9: 🌼🌳🐫🌼🐋🐋🦩🐚🌳🐋\nEmojis:\n0: 🌼\n1: 🌳\n2: 🐫\n3: 🌼\n4: 🐋\n5: 🐋 (4-5: 🐋)\n6: 🦩\n7: 🐚\n8: 🌳\n9: 🐋\n\nRun of 🐋 (4-5: length 2) →1.\n\nSo summing all horizontal lines:\n\nRow 0: 0\nRow 1: 1\nRow 2: 1\nRow 3: 2\nRow 4: 1\nRow 5: 0\nRow 6: 0\nRow 7: 2\nRow 8: 2\nRow 9: 1\nTotal horizontal: 0+1+1+2+1+0+0+2+2+1 = 10.\n\nNow vertical lines. Need to check each column, from top (row 0) to bottom (row 9).\n\nLet's list each column (0-9), and check consecutive runs.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow 0: 🌼\nRow 1: 🐚\nRow 2: 🐋\nRow 3: 🦔\nRow 4: 🚀\nRow 5: 🥀\nRow 6: 🌳\nRow 7: 🐫\nRow 8: 🐚\nRow 9: 🌼\n\nAll different. 0.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow 0: 🐋\nRow 1: 🌳\nRow 2: 🥀\nRow 3: 🦩\nRow 4: 🥀\nRow 5: 🐚\nRow 6: 🦔\nRow 7: 🌳\nRow 8: 🥀\nRow 9: 🌳\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\nRow 0-1: 🐋 vs 🌳 → no\nRow 1-2: 🌳 vs 🥀 → no\nRow 2-3: 🥀 vs 🦩 → no\nRow 3-4: 🦩 vs 🥀 → no\nRow 4-5: 🥀 vs 🐚 → no\nRow 5-6: 🐚 vs 🦔 → no\nRow 6-7: 🦔 vs 🌳 → no\nRow 7-8: 🌳 vs 🥀 → no\nRow 8-9: 🥀 vs 🌳 → no. So 0.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow 0: 🥀\nRow 1: 🌳\nRow 2: 🐫\nRow 3: 🐫\nRow 4: 🐫\nRow 5: 🌳\nRow 6: 🌼\nRow 7: 🌳\nRow 8: 🐋\nRow 9: 🐫\n\nLet's check:\n\nRow 0: 🥀\nRow 1: 🌳 → different\nRow 2: 🐫 → different from row 1\nRow 3: 🐫 → same as row 2 (row 2-3)\nRow 4: 🐫 → same as row 3 (row 3-4)\nSo run from row 2 to 4: 3 elements (rows 2,3,4). Length 3. So (3-1) = 2 lines.\n\nRow 5: 🌳 → different from row 4 (🐫)\nRow 6: 🌼 → different\nRow 7: 🌳 → different\nRow 8: 🐋 → different\nRow 9: 🐫 → different. So column 2 contributes 2.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow 0: 🚀\nRow 1: 🌼\nRow 2: 🐫\nRow 3: 🌼\nRow 4: 🌳\nRow 5: 🥀\nRow 6: 🐋\nRow 7: 🚀\nRow 8: 🐋\nRow 9: 🌼\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\nRow 0-1: 🚀 vs 🌼 → no\nRow 1-2: 🌼 vs 🐫 → no\nRow 2-3: 🐫 vs 🌼 → no\nRow 3-4: 🌼 vs 🌳 → no\nRow 4-5: 🌳 vs 🥀 → no\nRow 5-6: 🥀 vs 🐋 → no\nRow 6-7: 🐋 vs 🚀 → no\nRow 7-8: 🚀 vs 🐋 → no\nRow 8-9: 🐋 vs 🌼 → no. 0.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nRow 0: 🐚\nRow 1: 🐫\nRow 2: 🥀\nRow 3: 🐋\nRow 4: 🌳\nRow 5: 🌼\nRow 6: 🐚\nRow 7: 🚀\nRow 8: 🦔\nRow 9: 🐋\n\nCheck each pair:\n\nRow 0-1: 🐚 vs 🐫 → no\nRow 1-2: 🐫 vs 🥀 → no\nRow 2-3: 🥀 vs 🐋 → no\nRow 3-4: 🐋 vs 🌳 → no\nRow 4-5: 🌳 vs 🌼 → no\nRow 5-6: 🌼 vs 🐚 → no\nRow 6-7: 🐚 vs 🚀 → no\nRow 7-8: 🚀 vs 🦔 → no\nRow 8-9: 🦔 vs 🐋 → no. 0.\n\nColumn 5:\n\nRow 0: 🚀\nRow 1: 🥀\nRow 2: 🐚\nRow 3: 🌼\nRow 4: 🌼\nRow 5: 🥀\nRow 6: 🚀\nRow 7: 🦩\nRow 8: 🐚\nRow 9: 🐋\n\nCheck:\n\nRow 0-1: 🚀 vs 🥀 → no\nRow 1-2: 🥀 vs 🐚 → no\nRow 2-3: 🐚 vs 🌼 → no\nRow 3-4: 🌼 vs 🌼 → same (row 3-4).

Length 2 → 1 line.\nRow 1-2: 🌳 vs 🦩 → no\nRow 2-3: 🦩 vs 🌳 → no\nRow 3-4: 🌳 vs 🥀 → no\nRow 4-5: 🥀 vs 🐋 → no\nRow 5-6: 🐋 vs 🐋 → same (row 5-6). Length 2 → 1 line.\nRow 6-7: 🐋 vs 🌳 → no\nRow 7-8: 🌳 vs 🐫 → no\nRow 8-9: 🐫 vs 🦩 → no. So total 1+1=2.\n\nColumn 7:\n\nRow 0: 🐚\nRow 1: 🌼\nRow 2: 🥀\nRow 3: 🐋\nRow 4: 🐫\nRow 5: 🥀\nRow 6: 🚀\nRow 7: 🥀\nRow 8: 🐫\nRow 9: 🐚\n\nCheck:\n\nRow 0-1: 🐚 vs 🌼 → no\nRow 1-2: 🌼 vs 🥀 → no\nRow 2-3: 🥀 vs 🐋 → no\nRow 3-4: 🐋 vs 🐫 → no\nRow 4-5: 🐫 vs 🥀 → no\nRow 5-6: 🥀 vs 🚀 → no\nRow 6-7: 🚀 vs 🥀 → no\nRow 7-8: 🥀 vs 🐫 → no\nRow 8-9: 🐫 vs 🐚 → no. 0.\n\nColumn 8:\n\nRow 0: 🥀\nRow 1: 🦔\nRow 2: 🦩\nRow 3: 🐋\nRow 4: 🌳\nRow 5: 🐚\nRow 6: 🦩\nRow 7: 🦔\nRow 8: 🌼\nRow 9: 🌳\n\nCheck:\n\nRow 0-1: 🥀 vs 🦔 → no\nRow 1-2: 🦔 vs 🦩 → no\nRow 2-3: 🦩 vs 🐋 → no\nRow 3-4: 🐋 vs 🌳 → no\nRow 4-5: 🌳 vs 🐚 → no\nRow 5-6: 🐚 vs 🦩 → no\nRow 6-7: 🦩 vs 🦔 → no\nRow 7-8: 🦔 vs 🌼 → no\nRow 8-9: 🌼 vs 🌳 → no. 0.\n\nColumn 9:\n\nRow 0: 🚀\nRow 1: 🌼\nRow 2: 🌳\nRow 3: 🐋\nRow 4: 🐚\nRow 5: 🐫\nRow 6: 🐚\nRow 7: 🥀\nRow 8: 🌳\nRow 9: 🐋\n\nCheck:\n\nRow 0-1: 🚀 vs 🌼 → no\nRow 1-2: 🌼 vs 🌳 → no\nRow 2-3: 🌳 vs 🐋 → no\nRow 3-4: 🐋 vs 🐚 → no\nRow 4-5: 🐚 vs 🐫 → no\nRow 5-6: 🐫 vs 🐚 → no\nRow 6-7: 🐚 vs 🥀 → no\nRow 7-8: 🥀 vs 🌳 → no\nRow 8-9: 🌳 vs 🐋 → no. 0.\n\nWait, let's recheck column 6. Because column 6 is:\n\nRow 0: 🌳\nRow 1: 🌳 → 0-1 same (run of 2 → 1)\nRow 2: 🦩 → 1-2 different\nRow 3: 🌳 → 2-3 different\nRow 4: 🥀 → 3-4 different\nRow 5: 🐋 → 4-5 different\nRow 6: 🐋 → 5-6 same (run of 2 → 1)\nRow 7: 🌳 → 6-7 different\nRow 8: 🐫 → 7-8 different\nRow 9: 🦩 → 8-9 different. So 1+1=2. Correct.\n\nNow column 2: Let's recheck. Column 2:\n\nRow 0: 🥀\nRow 1: 🌳 → 0-1: different\nRow 2: 🐫 → 1-2: different\nRow 3: 🐫 → 2-3: same (run starts)\nRow 4: 🐫 → 3-4: same (run continues)\nSo the run is from row 2 to 4 (rows 2,3,4), length 3. So (3-1)=2 lines. Correct.\n\nSo vertical lines:\n\nColumn 0: 0\nColumn 1: 0\nColumn 2: 2\nColumn 3: 0\nColumn 4: 0\nColumn 5: 1\nColumn 6: 2\nColumn 7: 0\nColumn 8: 0\nColumn 9: 0\nTotal vertical: 0+0+2+0+0+1+2+0+0+0 = 5.\n\nWait, 2 (col2) + 1 (col5) + 2 (col6) = 5. Correct.\n\nNow total lines: horizontal (10) + vertical (5) = 15?\n\nWait, wait. Let me recheck horizontal rows again. Let's recount the horizontal:\n\nRow 0: 0 → correct.\n\nRow 1: [0:🐚,1:🌳,2:🌳,3:🌼...]. So 1-2: 🌳. Length 2 → 1. Correct.\n\nRow 2: [2:🐫,3:🐫]. 2-3: length 2 → 1. Correct.\n\nRow 3: [7:🐋,8:🐋,9:🐋]. 7-8, 8-9 → 2 lines. Correct.\n\nRow 4: [3:🌳,4:🌳]. 3-4 → 1. Correct.\n\nRow 7: [1:🌳,2:🌳 (1-2 → 1), 3:🚀,4:🚀 (3-4 → 1). So 1+1=2. Correct.\n\nRow 8: [2:🐋,3:🐋 (1), 6:🐫,7:🐫 (1). 1+1=2. Correct.\n\nRow 9: [4:🐋,5:🐋 → 1]. Correct.\n\nRow 5 and 6: 0. Correct.\n\nSumming: 0 (row0) +1 (row1) +1 (row2) +2 (row3) +1 (row4) +0 (row5) +0 (row6) +2 (row7) +2 (row8) +1 (row9) → 0+1=1, +1=2, +2=4, +1=5, +0=5, +0=5, +2=7, +2=9, +1=10. Correct, horizontal is 10.\n\nVertical columns: 2 (col2) +1 (col5) +2 (col6) = 5. So 10+5=15.\n\nWait, but let's check column 6 again. Let's list column 6's emojis again:\n\nOriginal board:\n\nRow 0: 🌼🐋🥀🚀🐚🚀🌳🐚🥀🚀 → column 6 is 🌳 (position 6)\nRow 1: 🐚🌳🌳🌼🐫🥀🌳🌼🦔🌼 → column 6 is 🌳 (position 6)\nRow 2: 🐋🥀🐫🐫🥀🐚🦩🥀🦩🌳 → column 6 is 🦩 (position 6)\nRow 3: 🦔🦩🐫🌼🐋🌼🌳🐋🐋🐋 → column 6 is 🌳 (position 6)\nRow 4: 🚀🥀🐫🌳🌳🌼🥀🐫🌳🐚 → column 6 is 🥀 (position 6)\nRow 5: 🥀🐚🌳🥀🌼🥀🐋🥀🐚🐫 → column 6 is 🐋 (position 6)\nRow 6: 🌳🦔🌼🐋🐚🚀🐋🚀🦩🐚 → column 6 is 🐋 (position 6)\nRow 7: 🐫🌳🌳🚀🚀🦩🌳🥀🦔🥀 → column 6 is 🌳 (position 6)\nRow 8: 🐚🥀🐋🐋🦔🐚🐫🐫🌼🌳 → column 6 is 🐫 (position 6)\nRow 9: 🌼🌳🐫🌼🐋🐋🦩🐚🌳🐋 → column 6 is 🦩 (position 6)\n\nSo column 6 emojis are:\n\nRow 0: 🌳\nRow 1: 🌳 → 0-1 same → run of 2 → 1 line.\nRow 2: 🦩 → 1-2 different.\nRow 3: 🌳 → 2-3 different.\nRow 4: 🥀 → 3-4 different.\nRow 5: 🐋 → 4-5 different.\nRow 6: 🐋 → 5-6 same → run of 2 → 1 line.\nRow 7: 🌳 → 6-7 different.\nRow 8: 🐫 → 7-8 different.\nRow 9: 🦩 → 8-9 different. So 1+1=2. Correct.\n\nColumn 2: Let's list column 2 (third emoji in each row, index 2):\n\nRow 0: 🥀 (third emoji, 0-based index 2)\nRow 1: 🌳 (index 2)\nRow 2: 🐫 (index 2)\nRow 3: 🐫 (index 2)\nRow 4: 🐫 (index 2)\nRow 5: 🌳 (index 2)\nRow 6: 🌼 (index 2)\nRow 7: 🌳 (index 2)\nRow 8: 🐋 (index 2)\nRow 9: 🐫 (index 2)\n\nSo:\n\nRow 0: 🥀\nRow 1: 🌳 → 0-1: different.\nRow 2: 🐫 → 1-2: different.\nRow 3: 🐫 → 2-3: same (run starts)\nRow 4: 🐫 → 3-4: same (run continues, length 3)\nRow 5: 🌳 → 4-5: different. So run from 2-4 (rows 2,3,4) → length 3 → 2 lines. Correct.\n\nColumn 5 (sixth emoji, index 5):\n\nRow 0: 🚀 (index 5)\nRow 1: 🥀 (index 5)\nRow 2: 🐚 (index 5)\nRow 3: 🌼 (index 5)\nRow 4: 🌼 (index 5)\nRow 5: 🥀 (index 5)\nRow 6: 🚀 (index 5)\nRow 7: 🦩 (index 5)\nRow 8: 🐚 (index 5)\nRow 9: 🐋 (index 5)\n\nSo:\n\nRow 3: 🌼, row 4: 🌼 → 3-4: same. Length 2 → 1 line. Correct.\n\nSo vertical total 2+1+2=5. Horizontal 10. 10+5=15.\n\nIs there any other possible runs I missed?\n\nLet's check row 7 again. Row 7: 🐫🌳🌳🚀🚀🦩🌳🥀🦔🥀. So positions 1-2: 🌳 (length 2 → 1), positions 3-4: 🚀 (length 2 → 1). So 2. Correct.\n\nRow 8: 🐚🥀🐋🐋🦔🐚🐫🐫🌼🌳. Positions 2-3: 🐋 (1), 6-7: 🐫 (1). 2. Correct.\n\nRow 3: positions 7-8-9: 🐋, 🐋, 🐋. 7-8 (1), 8-9 (1). 2. Correct.\n\nRow 9: position 4-5: 🐋, 🐋. 1. Correct.\n\nWhat about vertical column 7? Let's check column 7 (eighth emoji, index 7):\n\nRow 0: 🐚 (index 7)\nRow 1: 🌼 (index 7)\nRow 2: 🥀 (index 7)\nRow 3: 🐋 (index 7)\nRow 4: 🐫 (index 7)\nRow 5: 🥀 (index 7)\nRow 6: 🚀 (index 7)\nRow 7: 🥀 (index 7)\nRow 8: 🐫 (index 7)\nRow 9: 🐚 (index 7)\n\nNo consecutive same. Correct.\n\nSo the total should be 10+5=15.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more in a given 10x10 board. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Horizontal Lines**: For each row, check consecutive emojis. A sequence of length \\( L \\) (where \\( L \\geq 2 \\)) contributes \\( L-1 \\) lines (e.g., a sequence of length 3 contributes 2 lines: positions 0-1 and 1-2).\n2. **Vertical Lines**: For each column, check consecutive emojis. Similarly, a sequence of length \\( L \\) (where \\( L \\geq 2 \\)) contributes \\( L-1 \\) lines.\n\n### Solution Code\nWe process each row and column to identify consecutive sequences and count the lines they contribute.\n\n### Horizontal Line Calculation\n- **Row 0**: No consecutive emojis. Contribution: 0.\n- **Row 1**: Sequence of \"🌳\" at positions 1-2 (length 2). Contribution: 1.\n- **Row 2**: Sequence of \"🐫\" at positions 2-3 (length 2). Contribution: 1.\n- **Row 3**: Sequence of \"🐋\" at positions 7-9 (length 3). Contribution: 2.\n- **Row 4**: Sequence of \"🌳\" at positions 3-4 (length 2). Contribution: 1.\n- **Row 5**: No consecutive emojis. Contribution: 0.\n- **Row 6**: No consecutive emojis. Contribution: 0.\n- **Row 7**: Sequences of \"🌳\" at positions 1-2 (length 2) and \"🚀\" at positions 3-4 (length 2). Contribution: 2.\n- **Row 8**: Sequences of \"🐋\" at positions 2-3 (length 2) and \"🐫\" at positions 6-7 (length 2). Contribution: 2.\n- **Row 9**: Sequence of \"🐋\" at positions 4-5 (length 2). Contribution: 1.\n\n**Total Horizontal Lines**: \\( 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 10 \\).\n\n### Vertical Line Calculation\n- **Column 0**: No consecutive emojis. Contribution: 0.\n- **Column 1**: No consecutive emojis. Contribution: 0.\n- **Column 2**: Sequence of \"🐫\" at rows 2-4 (length 3). Contribution: 2.\n- **Column 3**: No consecutive emojis. Contribution: 0.\n- **Column 4**: No consecutive emojis. Contribution: 0.\n- **Column 5**: Sequence of \"🌼\" at rows 3-4 (length 2). Contribution: 1.\n- **Column 6**: Sequences of \"🌳\" at rows 0-1 (length 2) and \"🐋\" at rows 5-6 (length 2). Contribution: 2.\n- **Column 7**: No consecutive emojis. Contribution: 0.\n- **Column 8**: No consecutive emojis. Contribution: 0.\n- **Column 9**: No consecutive emojis. Contribution: 0.\n\n**Total Vertical Lines**: \\( 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 5 \\).\n\n### Total Lines\nAdding horizontal and vertical lines gives the final count: \\( 10 + 5 = 15 \\).\n\nAnswer: 15"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines of the same emoji with length 2 or more. So I need to check each possible horizontal line (rows) and vertical line (columns) for consecutive same emojis and count how many such sequences there are.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. A line here is a consecutive sequence of the same emoji. For example, if a row has \"🐳🐳🐳\", that's a horizontal line of length 3. But how do we count the number of lines here? Wait, the question says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". So each such consecutive run of length L (L ≥ 2) contributes (L - 1) lines? Or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's think again.\n\nWait, perhaps each maximal consecutive run of the same emoji contributes (run length - 1) lines. Because a run of length 2 has exactly 1 line (positions 0-1). A run of length 3 has two lines (0-1 and 1-2). Because a line is any two or more consecutive. So, for example, a run of 4 would have 3 lines (0-1, 1-2, 2-3). Because each pair of consecutive positions in the run is a line of length 2, and longer lines are built from these.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the number of such sequences, where a sequence is any consecutive group of 2 or more same emojis. For example, a run of 3 same emojis would count as 2 sequences (the first two, and the last two, and maybe the three as one? Wait, no. Let's clarify with an example.\n\nSuppose a row is \"A A A\". Then possible lines are:\n\n- positions 0-1 (length 2)\n\n- positions 1-2 (length 2)\n\n- positions 0-2 (length 3)\n\nSo how many lines are there here? The problem statement says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So each of these is a line. So the 3-length run has 3 lines (since 2-length: 2 lines, 3-length: 1 line. 2+1=3). Because 2-length is 2-1=1 (for 2 elements), 3-length is 3-1=2 (for 2 and 3 elements?), wait no.\n\nWait, let's take a simple example. Let's say a row has two same emojis: \"A A\". Then that's one line of length 2. So count 1.\n\nIf a row has three same emojis: \"A A A\". Then there are two lines of length 2 (positions 0-1 and 1-2) and one line of length 3 (positions 0-2). So total 3 lines.\n\nIf a row has four same emojis: \"A A A A\". Then lines are:\n\nLength 2: 0-1, 1-2, 2-3 → 3 lines.\n\nLength 3: 0-2, 1-3 → 2 lines.\n\nLength 4: 0-3 → 1 line.\n\nTotal 3+2+1=6 lines.\n\nAh! So for a run of length L (≥2), the number of lines is L*(L-1)\/2. Because for a run of L consecutive same emojis, the number of possible consecutive sequences (lines) of length ≥2 is the sum from k=2 to L of (L - k + 1). Which is (L-1) + (L-2) + ... + 1 = L*(L-1)\/2.\n\nYes, that makes sense. For L=2: 2*1\/2=1 → correct. L=3: 3*2\/2=3 → 3 lines. L=4: 4*3\/2=6 → 6 lines. So that's the formula.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each row, check consecutive runs of the same emoji. For each run of length L ≥2, add L*(L-1)\/2 to the total.\n\n2. Do the same for each column: check consecutive runs of the same emoji in the column. For each run of length L ≥2, add L*(L-1)\/2 to the total.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Iterate over each row in the board.\n\n- For each row, split into consecutive runs of the same emoji. For each run, if length >=2, compute L*(L-1)\/2 and add to the total.\n\n- Then, iterate over each column in the board.\n\n- For each column, split into consecutive runs of the same emoji. For each run, if length >=2, compute L*(L-1)\/2 and add to the total.\n\nSo let's process the given board. Let's first write down the board as rows. The board given is:\n\nRow 0: 🐳🐳🐳🐳🌞🦅 → [🐳, 🐳, 🐳, 🐳, 🌞, 🦅]\n\nRow 1: 🐳🦅🐳🐳🐤🦅 → [🐳, 🦅, 🐳, 🐳, 🐤, 🦅]\n\nRow 2: 🐳🐰🌞🐤🦅🐰 → [🐳, 🐰, 🌞, 🐤, 🦅, 🐰]\n\nRow 3: 🦅🦅🦅🐤🦅🐳 → [🦅, 🦅, 🦅, 🐤, 🦅, 🐳]\n\nRow 4: 🌞🐳🦅🐤🌞🐳 → [🌞, 🐳, 🦅, 🐤, 🌞, 🐳]\n\nRow 5: 🐳🐤🌞🐰🌞🌞 → [🐳, 🐤, 🌞, 🐰, 🌞, 🌞]\n\nSo the board has 6 rows, each with 6 columns.\n\nFirst, process the rows.\n\nProcessing row 0:\n\nRow 0: [🐳, 🐳, 🐳, 🐳, 🌞, 🦅]\n\nConsecutive runs:\n\n- 🐳: 4 in a row (positions 0-3). L=4. So 4*3\/2=6.\n\n- 🌞: 1 (position 4). No.\n\n- 🦅: 1 (position 5). No.\n\nSo row 0 contributes 6.\n\nRow 1: [🐳, 🦅, 🐳, 🐳, 🐤, 🦅]\n\nConsecutive runs:\n\n- 🐳: 1 (pos 0). No.\n\n- 🦅: 1 (pos 1). No.\n\n- 🐳: 2 (pos 2-3). L=2 → 2*1\/2=1.\n\n- 🐤: 1 (pos 4). No.\n\n- 🦅: 1 (pos 5). No.\n\nSo row 1 contributes 1.\n\nRow 2: [🐳, 🐰, 🌞, 🐤, 🦅, 🐰]\n\nAll elements are single. No runs of 2 or more. So 0.\n\nRow 3: [🦅, 🦅, 🦅, 🐤, 🦅, 🐳]\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🦅: 3 (pos 0-2). L=3 → 3*2\/2=3.\n\n- 🐤: 1 (pos 3). No.\n\n- 🦅: 1 (pos 4). No.\n\n- 🐳: 1 (pos 5). No.\n\nSo row 3 contributes 3.\n\nRow 4: [🌞, 🐳, 🦅, 🐤, 🌞, 🐳]\n\nAll elements are single. 0.\n\nRow 5: [🐳, 🐤, 🌞, 🐰, 🌞, 🌞]\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🌞: 2 (pos 4-5). L=2 → 2*1\/2=1.\n\nSo row 5 contributes 1.\n\nTotal from rows: 6 +1 +0 +3 +0 +1 = 11.\n\nNow process the columns. The board has 6 columns (each of 6 elements). Let's list each column.\n\nColumn 0 (positions 0 of each row):\n\nRow 0: 🐳\n\nRow 1: 🐳\n\nRow 2: 🐳\n\nRow 3: 🦅\n\nRow 4: 🌞\n\nRow 5: 🐳\n\nSo column 0: [🐳, 🐳, 🐳, 🦅, 🌞, 🐳]\n\nConsecutive runs:\n\n- 🐳: 3 (rows 0-2). L=3 → 3*2\/2=3.\n\n- 🦅: 1 (row 3). No.\n\n- 🌞: 1 (row4). No.\n\n- 🐳: 1 (row5). No.\n\nSo column 0 contributes 3.\n\nColumn 1 (positions 1 of each row):\n\nRow 0: 🐳\n\nRow 1: 🦅\n\nRow 2: 🐰\n\nRow 3: 🦅\n\nRow4: 🐳\n\nRow5: 🐤\n\nAll elements are unique. 0.\n\nColumn 2 (positions 2 of each row):\n\nRow0: 🐳\n\nRow1: 🐳\n\nRow2: 🌞\n\nRow3: 🦅\n\nRow4: 🦅\n\nRow5: 🌞\n\nSo column 2: [🐳, 🐳, 🌞, 🦅, 🦅, 🌞]\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🐳: 2 (rows 0-1). L=2 → 1.\n\n- 🌞: 1 (row2). No.\n\n- 🦅: 2 (rows 3-4). L=2 →1.\n\n- 🌞: 1 (row5). No.\n\nSo column 2 contributes 1 +1=2.\n\nColumn 3 (positions 3 of each row):\n\nRow0: 🐳\n\nRow1: 🐳\n\nRow2: 🐤\n\nRow3: 🐤\n\nRow4: 🐤\n\nRow5: 🐰\n\nSo column 3: [🐳, 🐳, 🐤, 🐤, 🐤, 🐰]\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🐳: 2 (rows 0-1). L=2 →1.\n\n- 🐤: 3 (rows 2-4). L=3 →3*2\/2=3.\n\n- 🐰: 1 (row5). No.\n\nSo column 3 contributes 1 +3=4.\n\nColumn 4 (positions 4 of each row):\n\nRow0: 🌞\n\nRow1: 🐤\n\nRow2: 🦅\n\nRow3: 🦅\n\nRow4: 🌞\n\nRow5: 🌞\n\nColumn 4: [🌞, 🐤, 🦅, 🦅, 🌞, 🌞]\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🌞: 1 (row0). No.\n\n- 🐤: 1 (row1). No.\n\n- 🦅: 2 (rows 2-3). L=2 →1.\n\n- 🌞: 2 (rows 4-5). L=2 →1.\n\nSo column 4 contributes 1 +1=2.\n\nColumn 5 (positions 5 of each row):\n\nRow0: 🦅\n\nRow1: 🦅\n\nRow2: 🐰\n\nRow3: 🐳\n\nRow4: 🐳\n\nRow5: 🌞\n\nColumn 5: [🦅, 🦅, 🐰, 🐳, 🐳, 🌞]\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🦅: 2 (rows 0-1). L=2 →1.\n\n- 🐰: 1 (row2). No.\n\n- 🐳: 2 (rows 3-4). L=2 →1.\n\n- 🌞: 1 (row5). No.\n\nSo column 5 contributes 1 +1=2.\n\nNow sum up all columns' contributions:\n\nColumn 0:3 → 3\n\nColumn1:0 → 0\n\nColumn2:2 → 2\n\nColumn3:4 →4\n\nColumn4:2 →2\n\nColumn5:2 →2\n\nTotal columns: 3+0+2+4+2+2=13.\n\nTotal overall: rows (11) + columns (13) = 24.\n\nWait, let's check each step again.\n\nRow 0: 4 🐳. 4*3\/2=6. Correct.\n\nRow1: 2 🐳 (positions 2-3). 2*1\/2=1. Correct.\n\nRow3: 3 🦅 (positions 0-2). 3*2\/2=3. Correct.\n\nRow5: 2 🌞 (positions 4-5). 1. Correct. So rows sum 6+1+3+1=11. (Yes, row 0:6, row1:1, row2:0, row3:3, row4:0, row5:1. 6+1=7, +3=10, +1=11. Correct.)\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 0: [🐳, 🐳, 🐳, 🦅, 🌞, 🐳]. The first three 🐳: L=3 →3*2\/2=3. Correct.\n\nColumn 2: [🐳, 🐳, 🌞, 🦅, 🦅, 🌞]. The first two 🐳 (L=2: 1) and next two 🦅 (L=2: 1). 1+1=2. Correct.\n\nColumn 3: [🐳, 🐳, 🐤, 🐤, 🐤, 🐰]. The first two 🐳 (1) and three 🐤 (3). 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nColumn 4: [🌞, 🐤, 🦅, 🦅, 🌞, 🌞]. The two 🦅 (1) and two 🌞 (1). 1+1=2. Correct.\n\nColumn5: [🦅, 🦅, 🐰, 🐳, 🐳, 🌞]. Two 🦅 (1) and two 🐳 (1). 1+1=2. Correct.\n\nSo column contributions sum 3+0+2+4+2+2=13.\n\nTotal 11 +13=24.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more. A line is defined as any consecutive sequence of the same emoji with length ≥ 2. For a consecutive run of length \\( L \\), the number of such lines is given by \\( \\frac{L \\times (L - 1)}{2} \\), as this formula accounts for all possible sub-sequences of length 2 or more within the run.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Horizontal Lines (Rows):** For each row, identify consecutive runs of the same emoji. For each run of length \\( L \\geq 2 \\), add \\( \\frac{L \\times (L - 1)}{2} \\) to the total count.\n2. **Vertical Lines (Columns):** For each column, identify consecutive runs of the same emoji. For each run of length \\( L \\geq 2 \\), add \\( \\frac{L \\times (L - 1)}{2} \\) to the total count.\n\n### Solution Code\nThe given board has 6 rows and 6 columns.

The task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines made of the same emoji, with length 2 or more. So I need to check each possible line in both directions (horizontal and vertical) and count how many such lines there are.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a \"line\" here means. For example, in a horizontal line (a row), if there are consecutive same emojis of length at least 2, each such consecutive segment contributes to the count. Wait, but how? Like, if there's a run of 3 same emojis, does that count as 2 lines (since 3-1=2) or 1? Let's think. Let's take a simple example. Suppose a row has \"A A A\". The horizontal lines here would be the first two A's (positions 0-1), the next two (1-2), and the entire three (0-2) if that's allowed. Wait no, no. Wait the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So a line is a consecutive sequence of same emojis of length ≥2. Each such consecutive sequence is a line. But wait, for a run of length k, how many lines does it contribute?\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify. Let's say a horizontal run of 3 same emojis. For example, \"A A A\". The possible lines here are:\n\n- The first two (positions 0-1) → length 2.\n\n- The next two (positions 1-2) → length 2.\n\n- The entire three (positions 0-2) → length 3.\n\nBut the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So each such consecutive segment of length ≥2 is a line. But wait, maybe a line is a maximal consecutive sequence? Or any possible consecutive sequence of length ≥2. For example, \"A A A\" has 3 possible lines: [0-1], [1-2], [0-2]. Because each of those is a line of length 2 or 3. But I need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each maximal consecutive sequence of same emojis (length ≥2) as a single line. Because if you have \"A A A\", that's a single line of length 3, which is ≥2, so it counts as 1. But that's possible. Let's check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So a \"line\" here is a consecutive sequence (horizontal or vertical) of the same emoji of length 2 or more. So each such consecutive sequence (regardless of being part of a longer sequence) is considered. Wait, but that's ambiguous. Let's take a sample. Suppose a row is \"A A A\". Then how many lines are there? Let's think of all possible consecutive sequences of length ≥2:\n\n- Positions 0-1: length 2 → counts.\n\n- Positions 1-2: length 2 → counts.\n\n- Positions 0-2: length 3 → counts.\n\nSo that's 3 lines. But maybe the problem counts each maximal run. A maximal run is a sequence that cannot be extended further. For \"A A A\", the maximal run is 3, which is length 3 ≥2, so it's 1 line.\n\nThe problem statement isn't clear. Let's look at the example given. The user provided a sample input, but the expected answer isn't given, so we have to figure it out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the intended approach is to count each consecutive pair of same emojis as a line. For example, in a run of k same emojis, the number of lines is (k-1). Because each adjacent pair contributes one line, and longer runs add more.\n\nWait, let's take a simple example. Suppose a horizontal row is \"A A A\". Then, how many lines? If we consider lines of length exactly 2, there are 2 (positions 0-1 and 1-2). If we consider lines of length ≥2, then 0-1 (2), 1-2 (2), 0-2 (3) → 3 lines. But perhaps the problem counts all possible such sequences. But maybe the problem counts a line as a consecutive sequence of length exactly 2, 3, etc., and each such sequence is counted once.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that a line is a set of consecutive same emojis, and for a run of length m (m ≥2), the number of lines contributed is (m - 1). For example, a run of 2: 1 line (since 2-1=1). A run of 3: 2 lines (3-1=2). Because each adjacent pair is a line of length 2, and a run of 3 has two adjacent pairs.\n\nBut how do we know? Let's think of the problem statement. Let's read again: \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So a line is a sequence of 2 or more same emojis in a row (horizontal) or column (vertical). So each such sequence is a line, and the count is how many such sequences exist.\n\nFor example, if in a row, there are two consecutive 'A's, that's one line. If there are three consecutive 'A's, that's a line of length 3. So that's another line. So 3 'A's would contribute 2 lines (the first two, and all three) or 1 line (the three)?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem counts a line as a maximal consecutive sequence. For example, \"A A A\" is a single line of length 3, so counts as 1. \"A A B B\" would have two lines (each of length 2), so counts as 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to count all possible sequences of 2 or more same emojis in a row (horizontal) or column (vertical). For example, \"A A A\" would have:\n\n- Positions 0-1 (length 2)\n\n- Positions 1-2 (length 2)\n\n- Positions 0-2 (length 3)\n\nSo 3 lines. But this could lead to a lot of counts, but maybe that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a \"line\" as a consecutive sequence of 2 or more same emojis, regardless of overlapping. So each possible consecutive sequence (substring) of length ≥2 in horizontal or vertical direction.\n\nBut let's think of a sample. Let's say a row is \"A A\". Then, it's 1 line (length 2). If a row is \"A A A\", then:\n\nPossible horizontal lines:\n\n- (row 0, columns 0-1) → length 2\n\n- (row 0, columns 1-2) → length 2\n\n- (row 0, columns 0-2) → length 3\n\nSo 3 lines.\n\nIf the row is \"A A B B\", then:\n\n- (0-1): A → length 2 → 1\n\n- (2-3): B → length 2 → 1\n\nTotal 2.\n\nAnother example: \"A A A B B B B\".\n\nHorizontal lines:\n\nA's:\n\n0-1 (2), 1-2 (2), 0-2 (3) → 3.\n\nB's:\n\n3-4 (2), 4-5 (2), 5-6 (2), 3-5 (3), 4-6 (3), 3-6 (4) → 6.\n\nSo total 3+6=9 lines.\n\nBut this approach would require checking all possible consecutive sequences, which can be time-consuming, but for a 5x5 grid, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to count each maximal consecutive run. So a run of length m (≥2) contributes 1 line. For example, \"A A A\" is 1 line, \"A A B B\" is 2 lines, \"A A A B B B B\" is 2 lines.\n\nBut the problem statement is ambiguous. However, the user is expecting a specific answer, so perhaps we need to find out which interpretation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem counts the number of consecutive pairs (i.e., sequences of exactly 2). For example, a run of 3 same emojis has 2 consecutive pairs (positions 0-1 and 1-2). A run of 4 has 3 consecutive pairs. So for a run of length m, the number of pairs is (m-1).\n\nLet's test this. Let's take a row with \"A A A\". The number of horizontal lines would be 2 (since 3-1=2). If a row has \"A A B B\", then 1 (for A's) +1 (for B's) = 2.\n\nIf this is the case, then the problem is to count all adjacent pairs (horizontal and vertical) where the two emojis are the same, and then sum them all.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"length of 2 or more\". So a pair is length 2, a trio is length 3, etc. So if a trio (length 3) is considered a line, then a run of 3 same emojis would contribute 1 line (the trio) plus 2 lines (the two pairs). But that's 3 lines. But that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem counts a line as a sequence of 2 or more, and each such sequence is counted once, regardless of length. For example, a run of 3 same emojis is a single line (length 3). So the count is the number of such runs (maximal) in horizontal and vertical directions.\n\nLet's see. Let's take the sample input given. The board is 5x5:\n\nRow 0: 🐮🐭🐯🐯🐮\n\nRow 1: 🐮🐯🐭🐯🐭\n\nRow 2: 🐯🐯🐭🐮🐯\n\nRow 3: 🐮🐯🐯🐮🐯\n\nRow 4: 🐮🐯🐮🐭🐭\n\nLet's first process horizontal lines (each row).\n\nRow 0: 🐮, 🐭, 🐯, 🐯, 🐮.\n\nLooking for consecutive same emojis. Let's list the runs:\n\n- 🐮 (length 1)\n\n- 🐭 (1)\n\n- 🐯 (2) → this is a run of length 2. So horizontal line (count 1).\n\n- 🐮 (1). So row 0 contributes 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow 1: 🐮, 🐯, 🐭, 🐯, 🐭.\n\nAll runs are length 1. So 0.\n\nRow 2: 🐯, 🐯, 🐭, 🐮, 🐯.\n\nFirst two 🐯: run of 2. So 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow 3: 🐮, 🐯, 🐯, 🐮, 🐯.\n\nMiddle two 🐯: run of 2. So 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow 4: 🐮, 🐯, 🐮, 🐭, 🐭.\n\nLast two 🐭: run of 2. So 1 horizontal line.\n\nSo total horizontal lines: 1 (row0) + 0 (row1) + 1 (row2) + 1 (row3) + 1 (row4) = 4.\n\nNow vertical lines (each column):\n\nThe board has 5 columns (0-4). Let's check each column.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow0: 🐮\n\nRow1: 🐮\n\nRow2: 🐯\n\nRow3: 🐮\n\nRow4: 🐮\n\nSo the column 0 emojis are: 🐮, 🐮, 🐯, 🐮, 🐮.\n\nLooking for runs of same emojis.\n\nCheck each position:\n\n- Rows 0-1: 🐮, 🐮 → run of 2. So vertical line (count 1).\n\n- Rows 1-2: 🐮 and 🐯 → different.\n\n- Rows 2-3: 🐯 and 🐮 → different.\n\n- Rows 3-4: 🐮, 🐮 → run of 2. So another vertical line (count 1).\n\nSo column 0 has 2 vertical lines.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow0: 🐭\n\nRow1: 🐯\n\nRow2: 🐯\n\nRow3: 🐯\n\nRow4: 🐯\n\nEmojis: 🐭, 🐯, 🐯, 🐯, 🐯.\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🐭 (1).\n\n- Then, rows 1-4: 🐯, 🐯, 🐯, 🐯 → run of 4. So how many vertical lines here?\n\nIf the run is 4, then in vertical direction, the run starts at row1 and ends at row4. So length 4. So if we count runs of length ≥2, this is 1 line (the entire run of 4).\n\nBut according to the previous approach (maximal runs), this is 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn 1: 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow0: 🐯\n\nRow1: 🐭\n\nRow2: 🐭\n\nRow3: 🐯\n\nRow4: 🐮\n\nEmojis: 🐯, 🐭, 🐭, 🐯, 🐮.\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🐯 (1).\n\n- Rows 1-2: 🐭, 🐭 → run of 2. So 1 vertical line.\n\n- 🐯 (1).\n\n- 🐮 (1). So column 2 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow0: 🐯\n\nRow1: 🐯\n\nRow2: 🐮\n\nRow3: 🐮\n\nRow4: 🐭\n\nEmojis: 🐯, 🐯, 🐮, 🐮, 🐭.\n\nRuns:\n\n- Rows 0-1: 🐯, 🐯 → run of 2 → 1.\n\n- Rows 2-3: 🐮, 🐮 → run of 2 → 1. So column 3 contributes 2.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nRow0: 🐮\n\nRow1: 🐭\n\nRow2: 🐯\n\nRow3: 🐯\n\nRow4: 🐭\n\nEmojis: 🐮, 🐭, 🐯, 🐯, 🐭.\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🐮 (1).\n\n- 🐭 (1).\n\n- Rows 2-3: 🐯, 🐯 → run of 2 → 1. So column 4 contributes 1.\n\nSo vertical lines: 2 (col0) + 1 (col1) + 1 (col2) + 2 (col3) + 1 (col4) = 7.\n\nTotal lines: horizontal (4) + vertical (7) = 11. But wait, let's recheck.\n\nWait, let's re-calculate the vertical lines.\n\nColumn 0: [🐮, 🐮, 🐯, 🐮, 🐮]\n\nThe runs are:\n\n- positions 0-1: 🐮, 🐮 → length 2. So 1.\n\n- positions 3-4: 🐮, 🐮 → length 2. So 1. Total 2.\n\nColumn 1: [🐭, 🐯, 🐯, 🐯, 🐯]\n\nThe runs are:\n\n- positions 1-4: 🐯, 🐯, 🐯, 🐯 → length 4. So 1.\n\nColumn 2: [🐯, 🐭, 🐭, 🐯, 🐮]\n\nRun at positions 1-2: 🐭, 🐭 → length 2. So 1.\n\nColumn 3: [🐯, 🐯, 🐮, 🐮, 🐭]\n\nRuns: positions 0-1 (🐯,🐯) → 1. positions 2-3 (🐮,🐮) → 1. Total 2.\n\nColumn 4: [🐮, 🐭, 🐯, 🐯, 🐭]\n\nRun at positions 2-3 (🐯,🐯) → 1.\n\nSo vertical lines sum to 2 +1 +1 +2 +1 =7.\n\nHorizontal lines:\n\nRow 0: [🐮,🐭,🐯,🐯,🐮] → run of 🐯 at positions 2-3 (length 2) → 1.\n\nRow 1: [🐮,🐯,🐭,🐯,🐭] → no runs of 2.\n\nRow 2: [🐯,🐯,🐭,🐮,🐯] → run of 🐯 at positions 0-1 (length 2) → 1.\n\nRow 3: [🐮,🐯,🐯,🐮,🐯] → run of 🐯 at positions 1-2 (length 2) →1.\n\nRow 4: [🐮,🐯,🐮,🐭,🐭] → run of 🐭 at positions 3-4 (length 2) →1.\n\nTotal horizontal: 1+0+1+1+1=4.\n\nTotal lines 4+7=11. But wait, is this correct?\n\nWait, let's check row 3 again. Row 3: 🐮, 🐯, 🐯, 🐮, 🐯. The second and third elements are 🐯, 🐯 → that's a run of 2, so 1. Correct.\n\nRow 2: first two are 🐯, 🐯 → 1. Correct.\n\nRow 4: last two are 🐭, 🐭 → 1. Correct.\n\nRow 0: third and fourth are 🐯, 🐯 → 1. Correct.\n\nRow 1 has no runs. Correct.\n\nVertical columns:\n\nColumn 0: runs at 0-1 (🐮,🐮) and 3-4 (🐮,🐮) → 2.\n\nColumn 1: 1-4 (🐯,🐯,🐯,🐯) → 1 (since it's a run of 4, which is ≥2).\n\nColumn 2: 1-2 (🐭,🐭) → 1.\n\nColumn 3: 0-1 (🐯,🐯) and 2-3 (🐮,🐮) → 2.\n\nColumn 4: 2-3 (🐯,🐯) →1.\n\nSo 2+1+1+2+1=7.\n\nTotal 4+7=11. But let's think again. Are there any other runs we missed?\n\nLet's check the vertical column 1 again. The column 1 is [🐭, 🐯, 🐯, 🐯, 🐯]. So positions 1-4 are 🐯, which is 4 in a row. So that's a vertical line of length 4, which counts as 1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: column 3. [🐯, 🐯, 🐮, 🐮, 🐭]. The first two are 🐯 (length 2), next two are 🐮 (length 2). So 2 lines.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the total would be 11. But perhaps I made a mistake. Let's recheck all rows and columns.\n\nHorizontal rows:\n\nRow 0: [🐮, 🐭, 🐯, 🐯, 🐮] → only the two 🐯 (indices 2 and 3) → 1.\n\nRow 1: [🐮, 🐯, 🐭, 🐯, 🐭] → no consecutive duplicates. 0.\n\nRow 2: [🐯, 🐯, 🐭, 🐮, 🐯] → first two 🐯 → 1.\n\nRow 3: [🐮, 🐯, 🐯, 🐮, 🐯] → middle two 🐯 (indices 1 and 2) → 1.\n\nRow 4: [🐮, 🐯, 🐮, 🐭, 🐭] → last two 🐭 → 1. Total 1+0+1+1+1=4. Correct.\n\nVertical columns:\n\nColumn 0 (rows 0-4): [🐮, 🐮, 🐯, 🐮, 🐮]\n\nCheck consecutive pairs:\n\nrows 0-1: same (🐮) → yes.\n\nrows 1-2: different (🐮 vs 🐯) → no.\n\nrows 2-3: different (🐯 vs 🐮) → no.\n\nrows 3-4: same (🐮) → yes. So 2 vertical lines here.\n\nColumn 1 (rows 0-4): [🐭, 🐯, 🐯, 🐯, 🐯]\n\nCheck consecutive pairs:\n\nrows 0-1: different (🐭 vs 🐯) → no.\n\nrows 1-2: same (🐯) → yes.\n\nrows 2-3: same (🐯) → yes.\n\nrows 3-4: same (🐯) → yes.\n\nSo, how many lines? If we count all possible consecutive sequences of length ≥2.\n\nThe column 1 has a run of 4 🐯 starting at row1. So the run is rows 1-4 (length 4). So the possible vertical lines here are:\n\nrows 1-2 (length 2), rows 2-3 (length 2), rows 3-4 (length 2), rows 1-3 (length 3), rows 2-4 (length 3), rows 1-4 (length 4). That's 6 lines. Oh! Oh, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because I was counting maximal runs, but the problem may require counting all possible sequences of 2 or more same emojis.\n\nAh, that's probably the error. Because if the problem counts all possible consecutive sequences (substrings) of length ≥2, then in a run of m same emojis, the number of such sequences is m*(m-1)\/2. Because for a run of m, the number of possible consecutive sequences of length ≥2 is (m-1) + (m-2) + ... +1 = m(m-1)\/2.\n\nFor example, a run of 2: 1 sequence (length 2) → 2(2-1)\/2=1.\n\nA run of 3: 3 sequences (length 2: 2, length 3: 1) → 3(3-1)\/2=3.\n\nA run of 4: 4(4-1)\/2=6. Which matches the 6 sequences I listed for column 1.\n\nSo, this is the key. So, the problem is to count all possible consecutive sequences (horizontal or vertical) of 2 or more same emojis. Each such sequence is counted as a line.\n\nSo, for a run of length m (same emojis), the number of lines is (m * (m-1)) \/ 2.\n\nLet's confirm with examples.\n\nExample 1: \"A A\" → m=2 → 2*1\/2=1 → 1 line. Correct.\n\nExample 2: \"A A A\" → m=3 → 3*2\/2=3 → 3 lines (0-1, 1-2, 0-2). Correct.\n\nExample 3: \"A A A A\" → m=4 → 4*3\/2=6 lines (0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 0-2, 1-3, 0-3). Correct.\n\nSo, the approach should be:\n\nFor each row and column, find all consecutive runs of the same emoji. For each run of length m ≥2, add (m*(m-1))\/2 to the total count.\n\nAh! That's probably the correct approach. Because the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". Each such line is a consecutive sequence of 2 or more. So a run of m same emojis contributes (m-1) + (m-2) + ... + 1 = m(m-1)\/2 lines.\n\nSo, let's redo the problem with this approach.\n\nFirst, process horizontal lines (rows).\n\nLet's process each row:\n\nRow 0: 🐮, 🐭, 🐯, 🐯, 🐮.\n\nLooking for consecutive runs of same emojis.\n\n- 🐮: length 1 → no contribution.\n\n- 🐭: length 1 → no.\n\n- 🐯: length 2 → m=2 → 2*1\/2=1.\n\n- 🐮: length 1 → no.\n\nTotal for row 0: 1.\n\nRow 1: 🐮, 🐯, 🐭, 🐯, 🐭.\n\nAll runs are length 1. So 0.\n\nRow 2: 🐯, 🐯, 🐭, 🐮, 🐯.\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🐯: length 2 → 2*1\/2=1.\n\nOthers are length 1. So row 2 contributes 1.\n\nRow 3: 🐮, 🐯, 🐯, 🐮, 🐯.\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🐯: length 2 → 1.\n\nSo row 3 contributes 1.\n\nRow 4: 🐮, 🐯, 🐮, 🐭, 🐭.\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🐭: length 2 → 1.\n\nSo row 4 contributes 1.\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 1+0+1+1+1=4. Same as before, but that's because each run is length 2. For runs longer than 2, this would change.\n\nNow, vertical lines (columns):\n\nLet's process each column.\n\nColumn 0: [🐮, 🐮, 🐯, 🐮, 🐮]\n\nLooking for consecutive runs of same emojis.\n\nLet's list the runs:\n\n- First two 🐮: rows 0-1 → length 2.\n\n- Then 🐯 (row2) → length 1.\n\n- Then 🐮 in rows 3-4 → length 2.\n\nSo two runs of length 2.\n\nEach contributes 2*1\/2=1. So 1 +1=2.\n\nColumn 1: [🐭, 🐯, 🐯, 🐯, 🐯]\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🐭: length 1.\n\n- 🐯: rows 1-4 → length 4. So m=4. Contribution 4*3\/2=6.\n\nSo column 1 contributes 6.\n\nColumn 2: [🐯, 🐭, 🐭, 🐯, 🐮]\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🐯: length 1.\n\n- 🐭: rows 1-2 → length 2 → 1.\n\n- 🐯: length 1.\n\n- 🐮: length 1.\n\nContribution: 1.\n\nColumn 3: [🐯, 🐯, 🐮, 🐮, 🐭]\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🐯: rows 0-1 → length 2 → 1.\n\n- 🐮: rows 2-3 → length 2 → 1.\n\n- 🐭: length 1.\n\nContribution: 1+1=2.\n\nColumn 4: [🐮, 🐭, 🐯, 🐯, 🐭]\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🐮: length 1.\n\n- 🐭: length 1.\n\n- 🐯: rows 2-3 → length 2 → 1.\n\n- 🐭: length 1.\n\nContribution: 1.\n\nSo vertical lines sum: 2 (col0) +6 (col1) +1 (col2) +2 (col3) +1 (col4) = 12.\n\nNow total lines: horizontal (4) + vertical (12) = 16.\n\nLet's verify:\n\nColumn 1: run of 4 🐯. The number of lines is 4*3\/2=6. Let's list them:\n\nPossible vertical sequences in column 1 (rows 1-4):\n\n- rows 1-2 (length 2) → 1.\n\n- rows 2-3 (length 2) → 1.\n\n- rows 3-4 (length 2) → 1.\n\n- rows 1-3 (length 3) → 1.\n\n- rows 2-4 (length 3) → 1.\n\n- rows 1-4 (length 4) → 1.\n\nTotal 6. Correct.\n\nColumn 0: two runs of 2 🐮 each. Each contributes 1. So 2.\n\nColumn 3: two runs of 2 → 1 each → 2.\n\nColumn 2 and 4: 1 each.\n\nVertical total 2+6+1+2+1=12.\n\nHorizontal lines: 4 (each run is 2, contributing 1 each).\n\nSo 4+12=16.\n\nLet's check all rows again.\n\nRow 0: one run of 2 → 1. Correct.\n\nRow 1: 0. Correct.\n\nRow 2: 1. Correct.\n\nRow 3: 1. Correct.\n\nRow 4: 1. Correct. Total 4.\n\nYes. Now, let's check other possible runs.\n\nLet's take row 3: [🐮, 🐯, 🐯, 🐮, 🐯]. The run of 🐯 is length 2 → 1. Correct.\n\nRow 2: [🐯, 🐯, ... ] → run of 2 → 1. Correct.\n\nRow 4: [ ..., 🐭, 🐭 ] → run of 2 → 1. Correct.\n\nRow 0: [ ..., 🐯, 🐯 ] → 1. Correct.\n\nSo horizontal is 4.\n\nVertical columns:\n\nColumn 0: 2 runs of 2 → 2*1=2.\n\nColumn 1: 1 run of 4 → 4*3\/2=6.\n\nColumn 2: 1 run of 2 → 1.\n\nColumn 3: 2 runs of 2 → 2*1=2.\n\nColumn 4: 1 run of 2 →1.\n\nTotal vertical 2+6+1+2+1=12.\n\nSo 4+12=16. That's the answer.\n\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, where each line has a length of 2 or more. A line is defined as any consecutive sequence of the same emoji with a length of at least 2. For a consecutive run of length \\( m \\) (where \\( m \\geq 2 \\)), the number of such lines is given by \\( \\frac{m(m-1)}{2} \\), which accounts for all possible sub-sequences of length 2 or more within the run.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Horizontal Lines**: For each row, identify consecutive runs of the same emoji. For each run of length \\( m \\geq 2 \\), add \\( \\frac{m(m-1)}{2} \\) to the total count.\n2. **Vertical Lines**: For each column, identify consecutive runs of the same emoji. For each run of length \\( m \\geq 2 \\), add \\( \\frac{m(m-1)}{2} \\) to the total count.\n\n### Solution Code\nWe analyze the given board row by row and column by column to count all valid lines.\n\n### Board Analysis\nThe board is a 5x5 grid:\n```\nRow 0: 🐮🐭🐯🐯🐮\nRow 1: 🐮🐯🐭🐯🐭\nRow 2: 🐯🐯🐭🐮🐯\nRow 3: 🐮🐯🐯🐮🐯\nRow 4: 🐮🐯🐮🐭🐭\n```\n\n#### Horizontal Lines\n- **Row 0**: Runs of 🐯 (length 2).

So the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines of the same emoji with length 2 or more. Hmm, right. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to look at each row (horizontal) and each column (vertical) of the board. For each row, check consecutive same emojis, and for each such consecutive sequence of length L (where L >=2), how many lines does that contribute? Wait, wait. Wait, a line here is a sequence of 2 or more same emojis. So for a horizontal line, if there's a run of 3 same emojis in a row, like A A A, then that's 2 possible lines of length 2 (positions 1-2 and 2-3) and 1 line of length 3 (1-3), but wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". So a line is a consecutive sequence of 2 or more. So a run of length L contributes (L - 1) + (L - 2) + ... + 1? No, wait, no. Because a line is a consecutive sequence. For example, a run of 3: positions 0-1-2. The lines here would be 0-1 (length 2), 1-2 (length 2), and 0-1-2 (length 3). So each run of length L contributes (L-1) lines? Because for length 2, 1 line. For length 3, 2 lines (2-length and 3-length). Wait, no. Wait, no. Let's think again. Suppose a run of 2: like A A. That's one line (length 2). A run of 3: A A A. That's two lines (the first two, and the last two) but wait, the entire three is also a line. Oh wait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". So each possible consecutive sequence of 2 or more same emojis is a line. So for a run of length L, the number of such lines is (L choose 2) ? No. Because the lines are contiguous. For example, in a run of 3 (positions 0,1,2), the possible lines are:\n\n- positions 0-1 (length 2)\n- positions 1-2 (length 2)\n- positions 0-1-2 (length 3)\n\nSo that's 3 lines. For a run of 4 (positions 0-1-2-3):\n\n- 0-1 (2)\n- 1-2 (2)\n- 2-3 (2)\n- 0-1-2 (3)\n- 1-2-3 (3)\n- 0-1-2-3 (4)\n\nWhich is 6 lines. Oh, wait, 3+2+1=6. Oh right! Because for a run of length L, the number of lines is the sum from k=2 to L of (L - k + 1). Because for each possible length k (2 <=k <= L), there are (L -k +1) lines. For example, L=3:\n\nk=2: 3-2+1=2 lines (0-1, 1-2)\nk=3: 3-3+1=1 line (0-1-2)\nTotal 2+1=3.\n\nL=4:\n\nk=2: 4-2+1=3 (0-1, 1-2, 2-3)\nk=3: 4-3+1=2 (0-1-2, 1-2-3)\nk=4: 4-4+1=1 (0-1-2-3)\nTotal 3+2+1=6.\n\nAh, so the formula for a run of length L is (L-1)*L\/2 - (1*2\/2) + ... Wait, no. Because the sum from k=2 to L of (L -k +1) is equal to sum from m=1 to L-1 of m, where m = L -k +1. Because when k=2, m= L-2+1= L-1. When k=L, m=1. So the sum is 1+2+...+(L-1) = (L-1)*L\/2. Oh right! Because 1+2+...+n = n(n+1)\/2, but here it's 1+2+...+(L-1) = (L-1)L\/2. For example, L=2: 1 term (1) → 1 → (2-1)*2\/2=1. Correct. L=3: 1+2=3 → (3-1)*3\/2=3. Correct. L=4: 1+2+3=6 → (4-1)*4\/2=6. Correct. Oh right! So for a run of L consecutive same emojis, the number of lines (of length 2 or more) is (L-1)*L\/2. Wait, wait. Let's confirm:\n\nFor L=2: 1 line (correct, 2-1=1, 1*2\/2=1)\nL=3: 3 lines (correct)\nL=4: 6 lines (correct)\nYes, that's right. Because 1+2+3+...+(L-1) = (L-1)L\/2. So that's the formula.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each row (horizontal), find all consecutive runs of the same emoji. For each run, compute (L-1)*L\/2 and add to the total.\n2. For each column (vertical), do the same: find consecutive runs of same emoji, compute (L-1)*L\/2 for each, add to total.\n3. Sum all these to get the answer.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Process each row. For each row, scan left to right, track current emoji and current run length. When the emoji changes, if the run length is >=2, add (L-1)*L\/2 to the total. Then reset the current emoji and run length.\n- Do the same for each column. For each column, scan top to bottom, track current emoji and run length. When the emoji changes, if run length >=2, add (L-1)*L\/2 to total.\n\nSo first, let's get the board. The input is:\n\nRow 0: 🦆🌈🦃🦀🦃🦆🦀 → Wait, wait the first row as given is: \"🦆🌈🦃🦀🦃🦆🦀\" Wait, let's count the characters. Let's list each row properly. Let's check:\n\nThe board is:\n\nRow 0: 🦆 🌈 🦃 🦀 🦃 🦆 🦀 → 7 emojis. Let's count: 1.🦆, 2.🌈, 3.🦃,4.🦀,5.🦃,6.🦆,7.🦀 → 7 elements (indices 0-6)\nRow 1: 🌑 🦃 ☄️ ☄️ 🌈 🦆 🦃 → 7 emojis. 0:🌑, 1:🦃, 2:☄️, 3:☄️, 4:🌈, 5:🦆, 6:🦃\nRow 2: 🦃 🦆 🦆 🌈 ☄️ ☄️ 🌈 → 7 emojis. 0:🦃,1:🦆,2:🦆,3:🌈,4:☄️,5:☄️,6:🌈\nRow 3: ☄️ 🦃 🦆 🌈 🦀 🌈 🦀 → 7 emojis. 0:☄️,1:🦃,2:🦆,3:🌈,4:🦀,5:🌈,6:🦀\nRow 4: ☄️ 🦃 🦀 🌑 🦀 🌑 🦆 → 7 emojis. 0:☄️,1:🦃,2:🦀,3:🌑,4:🦀,5:🌑,6:🦆\nRow 5: 🦃 🌈 🦆 🌈 🦆 🦆 🌈 → 7 emojis. 0:🦃,1:🌈,2:🦆,3:🌈,4:🦆,5:🦆,6:🌈\nRow 6: 🦃 🦆 ☄️ 🌑 🦀 🦀 ☄️ → 7 emojis. 0:🦃,1:🦆,2:☄️,3:🌑,4:🦀,5:🦀,6:☄️\n\nSo each row is 7 emojis, 7 rows (rows 0-6, columns 0-6).\n\nLet's start with processing the rows.\n\nProcessing Row 0: 🦆 🌈 🦃 🦀 🦃 🦆 🦀\n\nLet's list each emoji: [🦆, 🌈, 🦃, 🦀, 🦃, 🦆, 🦀]\n\nCheck consecutive runs.\n\nStart with emoji 🦆, count=1.

So the answer should be 12.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more. A line is defined as a consecutive sequence of 2 or more identical emojis. For a run of length \\( L \\) (where \\( L \\geq 2 \\)), the number of such lines is given by the formula \\( \\frac{(L-1) \\cdot L}{2} \\), which accounts for all possible sub-sequences of length 2 or more within the run.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Horizontal Lines**: For each row, identify consecutive runs of the same emoji. For each run of length \\( L \\geq 2 \\), compute the number of lines using \\( \\frac{(L-1) \\cdot L}{2} \\) and sum these values.\n2. **Vertical Lines**: For each column, repeat the same process as with rows: identify consecutive runs of the same emoji, compute the number of lines for each run of length \\( L \\geq 2 \\), and sum these values.\n\n### Solution Code\nWe analyze the given board row by row and column by column to count the valid lines.\n\n### Board Analysis\nThe board is a 7x7 grid:\n```\nRow 0: 🦆 🌈 🦃 🦀 🦃 🦆 🦀\nRow 1: 🌑 🦃 ☄️ ☄️ 🌈 🦆 🦃\nRow 2: 🦃 🦆 🦆 🌈 ☄️ ☄️ 🌈\nRow 3: ☄️ 🦃 🦆 🌈 🦀 🌈 🦀\nRow 4: ☄️ 🦃 🦀 🌑 🦀 🌑 🦆\nRow 5: 🦃 🌈 🦆 🌈 🦆 🦆 🌈\nRow 6: 🦃 🦆 ☄️ 🌑 🦀 🦀 ☄️\n```\n\n### Horizontal Lines Calculation\n- **Row 0**: No runs of length ≥ 2. Contribution: 0.\n- **Row 1**: One run of length 2 (☄️☄️). Contribution: \\( \\frac{(2-1) \\cdot 2}{2} = 1 \\).\n- **Row 2**: Two runs of length 2 (🦆🦆, ☄️☄️). Contribution: \\( 1 + 1 = 2 \\).\n- **Row 3**: No runs of length ≥ 2. Contribution: 0.\n- **Row 4**: No runs of length ≥ 2. Contribution: 0.\n- **Row 5**: One run of length 2 (🦆🦆). Contribution: 1.\n- **Row 6**: One run of length 2 (🦀🦀). Contribution: 1.\n\nTotal horizontal lines: \\( 0 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 5 \\).\n\n### Vertical Lines Calculation\n- **Column 0**: Two runs of length 2 (☄️☄️, 🦃🦃). Contribution: \\( 1 + 1 = 2 \\).\n- **Column 1**: One run of length 2 (🦃🦃). Contribution: 1.\n- **Column 2**: One run of length 2 (🦆🦆). Contribution: 1.\n- **Column 3**: One run of length 2 (🌈🌈). Contribution: 1.\n- **Column 4**: One run of length 2 (🦀🦀). Contribution: 1.\n- **Column 5**: One run of length 2 (🦆🦆). Contribution: 1.\n- **Column 6**: No runs of length ≥ 2. Contribution: 0.\n\nTotal vertical lines: \\( 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 7 \\).\n\n### Total Lines\nAdding horizontal and vertical lines gives the final count: \\( 5 + 7 = 12 \\).\n\nAnswer: 12"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

So, the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines of the same emoji with length 2 or more. Hmm. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to check every possible horizontal line (row-wise) and vertical line (column-wise) in the board. For each line (row or column), I need to find consecutive same emojis of length 2 or more. Then, count each such occurrence. But wait, how exactly? Like, if there's a run of 3 same emojis, does that count as 2 lines (since 3-1=2) or 1 line? Because a run of length n (n≥2) contributes (n-1) possible lines of length 2. Wait, no. Let me think again. For example, in a horizontal row like [A, A, A], the horizontal lines here are positions (0,0)-(0,1), (0,1)-(0,2), and (0,0)-(0,2). Wait, no, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So a line is a consecutive sequence of 2 or more same emojis. So a run of 3 same emojis is one line of length 3. Wait, but the question says \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines\". So each such consecutive sequence of 2 or more same emojis in a row or column counts as one line. For example, if a row has \"A A A B B\", then there are two lines: the first is the three A's (length 3), the second is the two B's (length 2). So each such consecutive group of 2+ same emojis in a row or column is a line. So the task is to count all such groups in all rows and columns.\n\nWait, let's confirm. Let's take a simple example. Suppose a row is [X, X]. That's one horizontal line. If the row is [X, X, X], that's one horizontal line (length 3). If the row is [X, X, Y, Y], that's two horizontal lines. If the row is [X, Y, X, X], that's one horizontal line (the two X's at the end). So for each row, we scan left to right, grouping consecutive same emojis. Each group with size ≥2 counts as 1. Similarly for columns.\n\nYes, that's the correct approach. So the plan is:\n\n1. For each row in the board, split into consecutive same emoji groups. For each group, if the length is ≥2, add 1 to the count.\n\n2. For each column in the board, split into consecutive same emoji groups. For each group, if the length is ≥2, add 1 to the count.\n\nSum all these to get the total.\n\nNow, let's get the board. The board given is 7 rows (since there are 7 lines), each with 7 emojis (since each line has 7 emojis). Let's list them as rows first.\n\nRow 0: 🦀🦀🦀🦥🥀🐵🦀 → 7 elements.\n\nRow 1: 🐫🥀🥀🐵🐵🐫🦀 → 7.\n\nRow 2: 🐵🐫🦀🐴🐵🐵🐫 → 7.\n\nRow 3: 🐫🐵🐵🐴🐴🐵🦀 → 7.\n\nRow 4: 🥀🐵🐴🦥🥀🐫🐫 → 7.\n\nRow 5: 🐫🦥🐵🦀🥀🐵🦀 → 7.\n\nRow 6: 🐵🥀🐴🐵🥀🐫🦥 → 7.\n\nSo 7 rows, 7 columns. Let's process each row first.\n\nProcessing Rows:\n\nRow 0: [🦀, 🦀, 🦀, 🦥, 🥀, 🐵, 🦀]\n\nLooking for consecutive same. Let's list the groups:\n\n- 🦀 (3 in a row) → length 3 ≥2 → count 1.\n\n- 🦥 (1) → no.\n\n- 🥀 (1) → no.\n\n- 🐵 (1) → no.\n\n- 🦀 (1) → no.\n\nSo row 0 contributes 1.\n\nRow 1: [🐫, 🥀, 🥀, 🐵, 🐵, 🐫, 🦀]\n\nGroups:\n\n- 🐫 (1) → no.\n\n- 🥀 (2) → yes → count 1.\n\n- 🐵 (2) → yes → count 1.\n\n- 🐫 (1) → no.\n\n- 🦀 (1) → no.\n\nSo row 1 contributes 2.\n\nRow 2: [🐵, 🐫, 🦀, 🐴, 🐵, 🐵, 🐫]\n\nGroups:\n\n- 🐵 (1) → no.\n\n- 🐫 (1) → no.\n\n- 🦀 (1) → no.\n\n- 🐴 (1) → no.\n\n- 🐵 (2) → yes → count 1.\n\n- 🐫 (1) → no.\n\nSo row 2 contributes 1.\n\nRow 3: [🐫, 🐵, 🐵, 🐴, 🐴, 🐵, 🦀]\n\nGroups:\n\n- 🐫 (1) → no.\n\n- 🐵 (2) → yes → count 1.\n\n- 🐴 (2) → yes → count 1.\n\n- 🐵 (1) → no.\n\n- 🦀 (1) → no.\n\nSo row 3 contributes 2.\n\nRow 4: [🥀, 🐵, 🐴, 🦥, 🥀, 🐫, 🐫]\n\nGroups:\n\n- 🥀 (1) → no.\n\n- 🐵 (1) → no.\n\n- 🐴 (1) → no.\n\n- 🦥 (1) → no.\n\n- 🥀 (1) → no.\n\n- 🐫 (2) → yes → count 1.\n\nSo row 4 contributes 1.\n\nRow 5: [🐫, 🦥, 🐵, 🦀, 🥀, 🐵, 🦀]\n\nGroups:\n\nEach emoji is single. So 0.\n\nRow 5 contributes 0.\n\nRow 6: [🐵, 🥀, 🐴, 🐵, 🥀, 🐫, 🦥]\n\nEach emoji is single. So 0.\n\nRow 6 contributes 0.\n\nTotal row contributions: 1 + 2 +1 +2 +1 +0 +0 = 7.\n\nNow, process the columns. There are 7 columns (0 to 6). Each column has 7 elements (rows 0-6).\n\nLet's list each column.\n\nColumn 0 (each row's 0th element):\n\nRow 0: 🦀\n\nRow 1: 🐫\n\nRow 2: 🐵\n\nRow 3: 🐫\n\nRow 4: 🥀\n\nRow 5: 🐫\n\nRow 6: 🐵\n\nSo column 0: [🦀, 🐫, 🐵, 🐫, 🥀, 🐫, 🐵]\n\nCheck consecutive same:\n\nLooking at the sequence: 🦀, 🐫, 🐵, 🐫, 🥀, 🐫, 🐵. All are single. So 0.\n\nColumn 1 (each row's 1st element):\n\nRow 0: 🦀\n\nRow 1: 🥀\n\nRow 2: 🐫\n\nRow 3: 🐵\n\nRow 4: 🐵\n\nRow 5: 🦥\n\nRow 6: 🥀\n\nSo column 1: [🦀, 🥀, 🐫, 🐵, 🐵, 🦥, 🥀]\n\nCheck consecutive same:\n\nLooking at the elements:\n\n- 🦀 (1)\n\n- 🥀 (1)\n\n- 🐫 (1)\n\n- 🐵 (2) → yes → count 1.\n\n- 🦥 (1)\n\n- 🥀 (1)\n\nSo column 1 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 2 (each row's 2nd element):\n\nRow 0: 🦀\n\nRow 1: 🥀\n\nRow 2: 🦀\n\nRow 3: 🐵\n\nRow 4: 🐴\n\nRow 5: 🐵\n\nRow 6: 🐴\n\nSo column 2: [🦀, 🥀, 🦀, 🐵, 🐴, 🐵, 🐴]\n\nCheck consecutive same:\n\nAll elements are single. 0.\n\nColumn 3 (each row's 3rd element):\n\nRow 0: 🦥\n\nRow 1: 🐵\n\nRow 2: 🐴\n\nRow 3: 🐴\n\nRow 4: 🦥\n\nRow 5: 🦀\n\nRow 6: 🐵\n\nSo column 3: [🦥, 🐵, 🐴, 🐴, 🦥, 🦀, 🐵]\n\nCheck consecutive same:\n\n- 🦥 (1)\n\n- 🐵 (1)\n\n- 🐴 (2) → yes → count 1.\n\n- 🦥 (1)\n\n- 🦀 (1)\n\n- 🐵 (1)\n\nSo column 3 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 4 (each row's 4th element):\n\nRow 0: 🥀\n\nRow 1: 🐵\n\nRow 2: 🐵\n\nRow 3: 🐴\n\nRow 4: 🥀\n\nRow 5: 🥀\n\nRow 6: 🥀\n\nSo column 4: [🥀, 🐵, 🐵, 🐴, 🥀, 🥀, 🥀]\n\nCheck consecutive same:\n\n- 🥀 (1)\n\n- 🐵 (2) → yes → count 1.\n\n- 🐴 (1)\n\n- 🥀 (3) → yes → count 1.\n\nSo column 4 contributes 2.\n\nColumn 5 (each row's 5th element):\n\nRow 0: 🐵\n\nRow 1: 🐫\n\nRow 2: 🐵\n\nRow 3: 🐵\n\nRow 4: 🐫\n\nRow 5: 🐵\n\nRow 6: 🐫\n\nSo column 5: [🐵, 🐫, 🐵, 🐵, 🐫, 🐵, 🐫]\n\nCheck consecutive same:\n\nLooking at elements:\n\n- 🐵 (1)\n\n- 🐫 (1)\n\n- 🐵 (2) → yes → count 1.\n\n- 🐫 (1)\n\n- 🐵 (1)\n\n- 🐫 (1)\n\nSo column 5 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 6 (each row's 6th element):\n\nRow 0: 🦀\n\nRow 1: 🦀\n\nRow 2: 🐫\n\nRow 3: 🦀\n\nRow 4: 🐫\n\nRow 5: 🦀\n\nRow 6: 🦥\n\nSo column 6: [🦀, 🦀, 🐫, 🦀, 🐫, 🦀, 🦥]\n\nCheck consecutive same:\n\n- 🦀 (2) → yes → count 1.\n\n- 🐫 (1)\n\n- 🦀 (1)\n\n- 🐫 (1)\n\n- 🦀 (1)\n\n- 🦥 (1)\n\nSo column 6 contributes 1.\n\nNow sum the column contributions: 0 (col0) +1 (col1) +0 (col2) +1 (col3) +2 (col4) +1 (col5) +1 (col6) → 0+1=1; +0=1; +1=2; +2=4; +1=5; +1=6. So columns contribute 6.\n\nTotal lines: rows (7) + columns (6) = 13.\n\nWait, let's recheck all calculations.\n\nRow 0: 1 (correct, 3 🦀s)\n\nRow 1: 2 (🥀x2, 🐵x2) → correct.\n\nRow 2: 1 (🐵x2) → correct.\n\nRow 3: 2 (🐵x2, 🐴x2) → correct.\n\nRow 4: 1 (🐫x2) → correct.\n\nRow 5: 0 → correct.\n\nRow 6: 0 → correct.\n\nSum rows: 1+2=3; +1=4; +2=6; +1=7. 7.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 0: 0 → correct.\n\nColumn 1: 1 (🐵x2 in rows 3 and 4 → row 3 is index 3, row 4 is index 4. So 3 and 4: [🐵, 🐵] → yes. So 1.\n\nColumn 2: 0 → correct.\n\nColumn 3: 1 (🐴x2 in rows 2 and 3 → row 2 is index 2, row 3 is index 3. So 2 and 3: [🐴, 🐴] → yes. 1.\n\nColumn 4: [🥀, 🐵, 🐵, 🐴, 🥀, 🥀, 🥀]. The elements are:\n\nRow 0: 🥀\n\nRow 1: 🐵\n\nRow 2: 🐵 → so 2 in a row (row1 and row2) → group of 2 → count 1.\n\nRow 3: 🐴\n\nRow 4: 🥀\n\nRow 5: 🥀 → row4: 🥀, row5: 🥀, row6: 🥀 → 3 in a row (rows 4,5,6). So group of 3 → count 1.\n\nSo column 4 contributes 2. Correct.\n\nColumn 5: [🐵, 🐫, 🐵, 🐵, 🐫, 🐵, 🐫]. The group is rows 2 and 3 (index 2 and 3): 🐵, 🐵 → 2 → count 1. Correct.\n\nColumn 6: [🦀, 🦀, ...] → rows 0 and 1: 🦀, 🦀 → 2 → count 1. Correct.\n\nSo columns sum to 0+1+0+1+2+1+1=6.\n\nTotal 7+6=13. So the answer is 13.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, where each line has a length of 2 or more. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Horizontal Lines**: For each row in the board, identify consecutive groups of the same emoji. Each group with a length of 2 or more counts as one horizontal line.\n2. **Vertical Lines**: For each column in the board, identify consecutive groups of the same emoji. Each group with a length of 2 or more counts as one vertical line.\n3. **Sum the Counts**: Add the number of horizontal lines and vertical lines to get the total count.\n\n### Solution Code\nWe analyze the given board row by row and column by column to count valid lines:\n\n#### Horizontal Lines Analysis:\n- **Row 0**: `🦀🦀🦀🦥🥀🐵🦀` → 1 group (3 🦀s) → 1 line.\n- **Row 1**: `🐫🥀🥀🐵🐵🐫🦀` → 2 groups (2 🥀s, 2 🐵s) → 2 lines.\n- **Row 2**: `🐵🐫🦀🐴🐵🐵🐫` → 1 group (2 🐵s) → 1 line.\n- **Row 3**: `🐫🐵🐵🐴🐴🐵🦀` → 2 groups (2 🐵s, 2 🐴s) → 2 lines.\n- **Row 4**: `🥀🐵🐴🦥🥀🐫🐫` → 1 group (2 🐫s) → 1 line.\n- **Row 5**: `🐫🦥🐵🦀🥀🐵🦀` → 0 groups → 0 lines.\n- **Row 6**: `🐵🥀🐴🐵🥀🐫🦥` → 0 groups → 0 lines.\n\nTotal horizontal lines: \\(1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 7\\).\n\n#### Vertical Lines Analysis:\n- **Column 0**: `🦀🐫🐵🐫🥀🐫🐵` → 0 groups → 0 lines.\n- **Column 1**: `🦀🥀🐫🐵🐵🦥🥀` → 1 group (2 🐵s) → 1 line.\n- **Column 2**: `🦀🥀🦀🐵🐴🐵🐴` → 0 groups → 0 lines.\n- **Column 3**: `🦥🐵🐴🐴🦥🦀🐵` → 1 group (2 🐴s) → 1 line.\n- **Column 4**: `🥀🐵🐵🐴🥀🥀🥀` → 2 groups (2 🐵s, 3 🥀s) → 2 lines.\n- **Column 5**: `🐵🐫🐵🐵🐫🐵🐫` → 1 group (2 🐵s) → 1 line.\n- **Column 6**: `🦀🦀🐫🦀🐫🦀🦥` → 1 group (2 🦀s) → 1 line.\n\nTotal vertical lines: \\(0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6\\).\n\n### Total Count\nAdding horizontal and vertical lines: \\(7 + 6 = 13\\).\n\nAnswer: 13"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

So, the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines of the same emoji with length 2 or more. Hmm, right. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to process each row (horizontal) and each column (vertical) of the board. For each row, check consecutive same emojis and count the lines of length 2 or more. Same for columns.\n\nLet me start by writing down the board to visualize it better. The board has 7 rows (since there are 7 lines given), each with 7 emojis. Let's index them from 0 to 6 for rows and columns.\n\nRow 0: 🌺💧🐳💧🦮🌕🐟 (indices 0-6)\nRow 1: 🐳🌕🦭💧🦭🐳💧\nRow 2: 🌺🐳🌕🦮🐳🐟🐟\nRow 3: 🌕🐳🐟🐟💧🐳🦭\nRow 4: 🦭🌕🐳🐳💧🐟💧\nRow 5: 🐳🐟🐳🐳🐟🐳🦮\nRow 6: 🦮🐳🦭🌺🌺🐳🐳\n\nLet's process horizontal lines first. For each row, we look for consecutive same emojis. For a sequence of length n (n >=2), the number of lines is (n - 1). Wait, no. Wait, a line is a consecutive run of the same emoji with length >=2. So for a run of k same emojis, the number of such lines is (k - 1) + (k - 2) + ... + 1? No, wait no. Let's think again. Suppose a run of 2: that's 1 line. A run of 3: like 🌺🌺🌺. The lines here are positions (0-1), (1-2), and (0-2) if we count all possible consecutive pairs. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So a line is a consecutive sequence of 2 or more. So a run of 3 same emojis would have 2 lines of length 2 (positions 0-1, 1-2) and 1 line of length 3 (0-2). So total 3 lines. Because each possible consecutive sequence of length >=2 in that run counts as a separate line. Oh, right! Because a line is any consecutive segment of 2 or more same emojis. So for a run of length L, the number of such lines is L*(L-1)\/2. Because the number of possible starting positions is 0 to (L-2), and each starting position i can have a line of length 2, 3, ..., up to (L - i). Wait, maybe a better way: for a run of L consecutive same emojis, the number of lines is the sum from k=2 to L of (L - k + 1). Because for length k, there are (L - k + 1) lines. For example, L=2: sum is 1 (k=2: 2-2+1=1). L=3: sum (k=2: 2 lines (positions 0-1, 1-2) and k=3: 1 line (0-2)) → 2+1=3. L=4: 3 (k=2: 3) + 2 (k=3: 2) +1 (k=4:1) → 6. So the formula is (L-1)*L\/2 - (1) → because sum from 1 to L-1 is (L-1)*L\/2, and sum from 2 to L is sum(1 to L-1) - 1 (since 1 is the term for k=1). Wait, no. Let's see. For L, the number of lines is the number of possible consecutive sequences of length >=2. Each such sequence is determined by its start and end indices, where end - start +1 >=2. So start can be from 0 to (L-1), end can be from (start +1) to (L-1). So for a run of L elements, the number of lines is (L-1) + (L-2) + ... +1 = (L-1)*L\/2. Because for start=0, end can be 1,2,...,L-1 → (L-1) options. Start=1, end=2,...,L-1 → (L-2) options. And so on until start=L-2, end=L-1 → 1 option. So sum 1+2+...+(L-1) = (L-1)*L\/2. Oh right! So that's the formula. So for a run of length L, the number of lines is (L*(L-1))\/2. Because 1+2+...+(L-1) is (L-1)*L\/2.\n\nSo for example, a run of 2: (2*1)\/2=1 line. Run of 3: 3*2\/2=3 lines. Run of 4: 4*3\/2=6 lines. That makes sense.\n\nSo the approach is: for each row, split into consecutive runs of the same emoji, calculate (L*(L-1))\/2 for each run where L >=2, sum all those. Then do the same for each column. Then sum all those to get the total.\n\nLet's process each row first.\n\nRow 0: 🌺💧🐳💧🦮🌕🐟. Let's list the emojis in order:\n\nIndices 0: 🌺, 1:💧, 2:🐳, 3:💧, 4:🦮, 5:🌕, 6:🐟. All are unique in consecutive positions. So no runs of length >=2. So row 0 contributes 0.\n\nRow 1: 🐳🌕🦭💧🦭🐳💧. The emojis are:\n\n0:🐳, 1:🌕, 2:🦭, 3:💧, 4:🦭, 5:🐳, 6:💧. All consecutive are different. So 0.\n\nRow 2: 🌺🐳🌕🦮🐳🐟🐟. Let's check:\n\nIndices 0:🌺, 1:🐳, 2:🌕, 3:🦮, 4:🐳, 5:🐟, 6:🐟. The last two (5 and 6) are 🐟. So a run of length 2. So (2*1)\/2=1. So row 2 contributes 1.\n\nRow 3: 🌕🐳🐟🐟💧🐳🦭. Emojis:\n\n0:🌕, 1:🐳, 2:🐟, 3:🐟, 4:💧, 5:🐳, 6:🦭. The run at 2-3 (🐟,🐟) → length 2. So 1. So row 3 contributes 1.\n\nRow 4: 🦭🌕🐳🐳💧🐟💧. Emojis:\n\n0:🦭, 1:🌕, 2:🐳, 3:🐳, 4:💧, 5:🐟, 6:💧. The run at 2-3 (🐳,🐳) → length 2. So 1. So row 4 contributes 1.\n\nRow 5: 🐳🐟🐳🐳🐟🐳🦮. Let's check:\n\n0:🐳, 1:🐟, 2:🐳, 3:🐳, 4:🐟, 5:🐳, 6:🦮. The run at 2-3 (🐳,🐳) → length 2. So 1. So row 5 contributes 1.\n\nRow 6: 🦮🐳🦭🌺🌺🐳🐳. Emojis:\n\n0:🦮, 1:🐳, 2:🦭, 3:🌺, 4:🌺, 5:🐳, 6:🐳. So runs at 3-4 (🌺,🌺) → length 2 (1) and 5-6 (🐳,🐳) → length 2 (1). So 1 + 1 = 2. So row 6 contributes 2.\n\nSo total horizontal lines: 0 (row0) + 0 (row1) +1 (row2) +1 (row3) +1 (row4) +1 (row5) +2 (row6) → 0+0+1+1+1+1+2=6.\n\nNow let's process vertical lines. Columns are 0 to 6, each has 7 elements (rows 0-6). Let's list each column.\n\nColumn 0 (rows 0-6):\n\nRow0: 🌺\n\nRow1: 🐳\n\nRow2: 🌺\n\nRow3: 🌕\n\nRow4: 🦭\n\nRow5: 🐳\n\nRow6: 🦮\n\nSo elements: 🌺,🐳,🌺,🌕,🦭,🐳,🦮 → all different. So 0.\n\nColumn 1 (rows 0-6):\n\nRow0: 💧\n\nRow1: 🌕\n\nRow2: 🐳\n\nRow3: 🐳\n\nRow4: 🌕\n\nRow5: 🐟\n\nRow6: 🐳\n\nElements: 💧,🌕,🐳,🐳,🌕,🐟,🐳. Let's check consecutive:\n\nLooking for runs of same. Let's list the sequence:\n\nRow0: 💧 → different from row1 (🌕). Row1 (🌕) vs row2 (🐳): different. Row2 (🐳) vs row3 (🐳): same. So run starts at row2, length 2 (rows 2 and 3). Then row3 (🐳) vs row4 (🌕): different. So that's a run of 2. So (2*1)\/2=1. Then row4 (🌕) vs row5 (🐟): different. Row5 (🐟) vs row6 (🐳): different. So column 1 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 2 (rows 0-6):\n\nRow0: 🐳\n\nRow1: 🦭\n\nRow2: 🌕\n\nRow3: 🐟\n\nRow4: 🐳\n\nRow5: 🐳\n\nRow6: 🦭\n\nElements: 🐳,🦭,🌕,🐟,🐳,🐳,🦭. Let's check:\n\nRow4: 🐳, row5: 🐳 → run of 2. So 1. So column 2 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 3 (rows 0-6):\n\nRow0: 💧\n\nRow1: 💧\n\nRow2: 🦮\n\nRow3: 🐟\n\nRow4: 🐳\n\nRow5: 🐳\n\nRow6: 🌺\n\nElements: 💧,💧,🦮,🐟,🐳,🐳,🌺.\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\nRow0 and row1: 💧,💧 → run of 2. (2*1)\/2=1. Then row1 (💧) vs row2 (🦮): different. Then row4 (🐳) and row5 (🐳): run of 2. (1). So total 1 +1=2. So column 3 contributes 2.\n\nColumn 4 (rows 0-6):\n\nRow0: 🦮\n\nRow1: 🦭\n\nRow2: 🐳\n\nRow3: 💧\n\nRow4: 💧\n\nRow5: 🐟\n\nRow6: 🌺\n\nElements: 🦮,🦭,🐳,💧,💧,🐟,🌺.\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\nRow3 (💧) and row4 (💧): run of 2 → 1. So column 4 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 5 (rows 0-6):\n\nRow0: 🌕\n\nRow1: 🐳\n\nRow2: 🐟\n\nRow3: 🐳\n\nRow4: 🐟\n\nRow5: 🐳\n\nRow6: 🐳\n\nElements: 🌕,🐳,🐟,🐳,🐟,🐳,🐳.\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\nRow5 (🐳) and row6 (🐳): run of 2 → 1. So column 5 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 6 (rows 0-6):\n\nRow0: 🐟\n\nRow1: 💧\n\nRow2: 🐟\n\nRow3: 🦭\n\nRow4: 💧\n\nRow5: 🦮\n\nRow6: 🐳\n\nElements: 🐟,💧,🐟,🦭,💧,🦮,🐳 → all different. So 0.\n\nNow let's list the column contributions:\n\nColumn 0: 0\n\nColumn 1:1\n\nColumn 2:1\n\nColumn 3:2\n\nColumn 4:1\n\nColumn 5:1\n\nColumn 6:0\n\nSum columns: 0 +1 +1 +2 +1 +1 +0 =6.\n\nSo total lines = horizontal (6) + vertical (6) = 12.\n\nWait, let me recheck each step to make sure I didn't miss any runs.\n\nRechecking horizontal rows:\n\nRow 0: 🌺💧🐳💧🦮🌕🐟 → all unique. Correct. 0.\n\nRow 1: 🐳🌕🦭💧🦭🐳💧 → all unique. 0.\n\nRow 2: 🌺🐳🌕🦮🐳🐟🐟 → the last two are 🐟. Run of 2. 1. Correct.\n\nRow 3: 🌕🐳🐟🐟💧🐳🦭 → 🐟🐟. 1. Correct.\n\nRow4: 🦭🌕🐳🐳💧🐟💧 → 🐳🐳. 1. Correct.\n\nRow5: 🐳🐟🐳🐳🐟🐳🦮 → 🐳🐳 (positions 2-3). 1. Correct.\n\nRow6: 🦮🐳🦭🌺🌺🐳🐳 → 🌺🌺 (3-4) and 🐳🐳 (5-6). 1+1=2. Correct. Sum 0+0+1+1+1+1+2=6. Correct.\n\nVertical columns:\n\nColumn 0: 🌺,🐳,🌺,🌕,🦭,🐳,🦮 → all different. 0. Correct.\n\nColumn 1: 💧,🌕,🐳,🐳,🌕,🐟,🐳 → the run is rows 2-3 (🐳,🐳). 1. Correct.\n\nColumn 2: 🐳,🦭,🌕,🐟,🐳,🐳,🦭 → rows 4-5 (🐳,🐳). 1. Correct.\n\nColumn 3: 💧,💧,🦮,🐟,🐳,🐳,🌺 → rows 0-1 (💧,💧) and rows 4-5 (🐳,🐳). So 1 (for 0-1) and 1 (for 4-5). Sum 2. Correct.\n\nColumn 4: 🦮,🦭,🐳,💧,💧,🐟,🌺 → rows 3-4 (💧,💧). 1. Correct.\n\nColumn 5: 🌕,🐳,🐟,🐳,🐟,🐳,🐳 → rows 5-6 (🐳,🐳). 1. Correct.\n\nColumn 6: 🐟,💧,🐟,🦭,💧,🦮,🐳 → all different. 0. Correct.\n\nSum of columns: 0+1+1+2+1+1+0=6. Correct.\n\nTotal lines 6 +6=12.

So, the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines made up of the same emoji, where each line is at least length 2. Hmm. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to look at each row (horizontal) and each column (vertical) and check for consecutive same emojis. For each such consecutive sequence of length L (where L >=2), the number of lines in that sequence is (L - 1) + (L - 2) + ... + 1. Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me think again. For example, if there's a horizontal line of 3 same emojis in a row, like 🌙🌙🌙, how many lines of length 2 or more does that contribute?\n\nOh right! Because a line is a consecutive sequence of the same emoji with length 2 or more. So for a sequence of length L, the number of possible lines is (L - 1). Because a line of length 2 starts at position 0 (positions 0-1), and 1 (positions 1-2) for L=3. So 3-1=2 lines. Wait, let's confirm:\n\nIf L=2: 1 line (positions 0-1)\nIf L=3: 2 lines (0-1 and 1-2)\nIf L=4: 3 lines (0-1, 1-2, 2-3)\nSo yes, for a run of length L, the number of lines is (L-1). Because each consecutive pair contributes a line. So a run of 2 gives 1 line, 3 gives 2, etc.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each row in the board, check all consecutive runs of the same emoji. For each run, if the length is >=2, add (length-1) to the total.\n2. Do the same for each column in the board. For each column, check consecutive runs, and add (length-1) for each run of length >=2.\n\nSo let's start by processing the rows first. Let's list each row and find the runs.\n\nThe board is given as:\n\nRow 0: 🌙🌙🐨🐋🌼🌼\nRow 1: 🌙🌼🐋🐨🐋🌙\nRow 2: 🐨🌼🌙🐋🌼🌙\nRow 3: 🌼🐋🌼🐋🌙🐨\nRow 4: 🌼🌙🌙🐨🌼🐋\nRow 5: 🐨🌙🌼🐨🐋🌼\n\nLet's process each row:\n\nRow 0: 🌙, 🌙, 🐨, 🐋, 🌼, 🌼\nLooking for consecutive same emojis.\n\n- 🌙 occurs twice (positions 0-1): length 2 → contributes 1.\n- 🐨 is alone (position 2) → no.\n- 🐋 is alone (position 3) → no.\n- 🌼 occurs twice (positions 4-5): length 2 → contributes 1.\nTotal for row 0: 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nRow 1: 🌙, 🌼, 🐋, 🐨, 🐋, 🌙\nCheck consecutive:\n\n- 🌙 (0) → next is 🌼 (1), different. So no runs here.\n- 🌼 (1) → next is 🐋 (2), different. No.\n- 🐋 (2) → next is 🐨 (3), different. No.\n- 🐨 (3) → next is 🐋 (4), different. No.\n- 🐋 (4) → next is 🌙 (5), different. No.\nNo runs of length >=2. So row 1 contributes 0.\n\nRow 2: 🐨, 🌼, 🌙, 🐋, 🌼, 🌙\nEach emoji is different from the next. So no runs. Row 2: 0.\n\nRow 3: 🌼, 🐋, 🌼, 🐋, 🌙, 🐨\nAll consecutive are different. So 0.\n\nRow 4: 🌼, 🌙, 🌙, 🐨, 🌼, 🐋\nCheck:\n\n- 🌼 (0) → next 🌙 (1) → different. No.\n- 🌙 (1-2): two 🌙. Length 2 → 1.\n- 🐨 (3) → next 🌼 (4) → different. No.\n- 🌼 (4) → next 🐋 (5) → different. No.\nRow 4 contributes 1.\n\nRow 5: 🐨, 🌙, 🌼, 🐨, 🐋, 🌼\nEach consecutive is different. So 0.\n\nSo total horizontal lines: 2 (row0) + 0 (row1) + 0 (row2) + 0 (row3) +1 (row4) +0 (row5) = 3.\n\nNow let's process the columns. There are 6 columns (since each row has 6 elements). Let's list each column (each column has 6 elements, rows 0-5).\n\nColumn 0 (rows 0-5): 🌙, 🌙, 🐨, 🌼, 🌼, 🐨\nSo elements are [🌙, 🌙, 🐨, 🌼, 🌼, 🐨]\nCheck consecutive runs:\n\n- 🌙 (row0 and row1): 2 → contributes 1.\n- 🐨 (row2) → next row3 is 🌼. Different. No.\n- 🌼 (row3 and row4): 2 → contributes 1.\n- 🐨 (row5) → no.\nSo column 0 contributes 1 +1 = 2.\n\nColumn 1 (rows 0-5): 🌙, 🌼, 🌼, 🐋, 🌙, 🌙\nElements: [🌙, 🌼, 🌼, 🐋, 🌙, 🌙]\nCheck runs:\n\n- 🌙 (row0) → next 🌼 (row1): different. No.\n- 🌼 (row1 and row2): 2 → 1.\n- 🐋 (row3) → next 🌙 (row4): different. No.\n- 🌙 (row4 and row5): 2 → 1.\nTotal: 1 +1=2.\n\nColumn 2 (rows 0-5): 🐨, 🐋, 🌙, 🌼, 🌙, 🌼\nElements: [🐨, 🐋, 🌙, 🌼, 🌙, 🌼]\nCheck consecutive:\n\nAll consecutive elements are different. 0.\n\nColumn 3 (rows 0-5): 🐋, 🐨, 🐋, 🐋, 🐨, 🐨\nElements: [🐋, 🐨, 🐋, 🐋, 🐨, 🐨]\nCheck runs:\n\n- 🐋 (row0) → next 🐨 (row1): different. No.\n- 🐨 (row1) → next 🐋 (row2): different. No.\n- 🐋 (row2 and row3): 2 → 1.\n- 🐨 (row4 and row5): 2 → 1.\nTotal: 1 +1=2.\n\nColumn 4 (rows 0-5): 🌼, 🐋, 🌼, 🌙, 🌼, 🐋\nElements: [🌼, 🐋, 🌼, 🌙, 🌼, 🐋]\nCheck consecutive:\n\nAll consecutive elements are different. 0.\n\nColumn 5 (rows 0-5): 🌼, 🌙, 🌙, 🐨, 🐋, 🌼\nElements: [🌼, 🌙, 🌙, 🐨, 🐋, 🌼]\nCheck runs:\n\n- 🌼 (row0) → next 🌙 (row1): different. No.\n- 🌙 (row1 and row2): 2 → 1.\n- 🐨 (row3) → next 🐋 (row4): different. No.\n- 🐋 (row4) → next 🌼 (row5): different. No.\nSo column 5 contributes 1.\n\nSo column contributions: 2 (col0) + 2 (col1) +0 (col2) +2 (col3) +0 (col4) +1 (col5) = 7.\n\nAdding horizontal (3) and vertical (7) gives total 10.\n\nWait, let's double-check.\n\nLet me recheck the columns.\n\nColumn 0: [🌙, 🌙, 🐨, 🌼, 🌼, 🐨]\n\nConsecutive runs:\n\nAt positions 0-1: 🌙 (length 2) → 1.\n\nThen position 2: 🐨 (different from 🌙, and next is 🌼 (position3). So no run here.\n\nPositions 3-4: 🌼 (length 2) → 1.\n\nSo 1+1=2. Correct.\n\nColumn 1: [🌙, 🌼, 🌼, 🐋, 🌙, 🌙]\n\nCheck:\n\n0: 🌙, 1: 🌼 → different. No run.\n\n1-2: 🌼 (length 2) → 1.\n\n2: 🌼, 3: 🐋 → different.\n\n3: 🐋, 4: 🌙 → different.\n\n4-5: 🌙 (length 2) → 1. So 2. Correct.\n\nColumn 3: [🐋, 🐨, 🐋, 🐋, 🐨, 🐨]\n\nCheck:\n\n0: 🐋, 1: 🐨 → different.\n\n1: 🐨, 2: 🐋 → different.\n\n2-3: 🐋 (length 2) → 1.\n\n3: 🐋, 4: 🐨 → different.\n\n4-5: 🐨 (length 2) → 1. So 2. Correct.\n\nColumn 5: [🌼, 🌙, 🌙, 🐨, 🐋, 🌼]\n\n0: 🌼, 1: 🌙 → different.\n\n1-2: 🌙 (length 2) → 1.\n\n2: 🌙, 3: 🐨 → different.\n\n3: 🐨, 4: 🐋 → different.\n\n4: 🐋, 5: 🌼 → different. So 1. Correct.\n\nSo column 0 (2) + column 1 (2) + column 3 (2) + column 5 (1) = 2+2+2+1=7. The other columns (2,4) are 0.\n\nHorizontal rows:\n\nRow 0: 🌙🌙 (2) and 🌼🌼 (2) → 1+1=2.\n\nRow 4: 🌙🌙 (2) → 1. So 2+1=3.\n\nSo 3+7=10.\n\nIs there any mistake here? Let's check row 4 again. Row 4 is 🌼🌙🌙🐨🌼🐋. The 🌙 is at positions 1 and 2 (indices 1 and 2). So length 2 → 1. Correct.\n\nWhat about column 3? Let's recheck. The column 3 elements are row0: 🐋, row1: 🐨, row2: 🐋, row3: 🐋, row4: 🐨, row5: 🐨. So:\n\nRow0: 🐋, row1: 🐨 → different.\n\nRow1: 🐨, row2: 🐋 → different.\n\nRow2: 🐋, row3: 🐋 → same. So run of 2 (positions 2-3) → 1.\n\nRow3: 🐋, row4: 🐨 → different.\n\nRow4: 🐨, row5: 🐨 → same. Run of 2 (positions 4-5) → 1. So 2. Correct.\n\nSo the total is 3 (horizontal) +7 (vertical) =10.\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, where each line has a length of 2 or more. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Horizontal Lines**: For each row, check consecutive sequences of the same emoji. For a sequence of length \\( L \\) (where \\( L \\geq 2 \\)), the number of valid lines is \\( L - 1 \\).\n2. **Vertical Lines**: For each column, check consecutive sequences of the same emoji. Similarly, for a sequence of length \\( L \\) (where \\( L \\geq 2 \\)), the number of valid lines is \\( L - 1 \\).\n\n### Solution Code\nWe analyze each row and column to count the valid lines:\n\n#### Horizontal Lines\n- **Row 0**: `🌙🌙🐨🐋🌼🌼` has two sequences of length 2 (`🌙🌙` and `🌼🌼`), contributing \\( 1 + 1 = 2 \\).\n- **Row 1**: `🌙🌼🐋🐨🐋🌙` has no sequences of length ≥2, contributing \\( 0 \\).\n- **Row 2**: `🐨🌼🌙🐋🌼🌙` has no sequences of length ≥2, contributing \\( 0 \\).\n- **Row 3**: `🌼🐋🌼🐋🌙🐨` has no sequences of length ≥2, contributing \\( 0 \\).\n- **Row 4**: `🌼🌙🌙🐨🌼🐋` has one sequence of length 2 (`🌙🌙`), contributing \\( 1 \\).\n- **Row 5**: `🐨🌙🌼🐨🐋🌼` has no sequences of length ≥2, contributing \\( 0 \\).\n\nTotal horizontal lines: \\( 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 3 \\).\n\n#### Vertical Lines\n- **Column 0**: `🌙, 🌙, 🐨, 🌼, 🌼, 🐨` has two sequences of length 2 (`🌙🌙` and `🌼🌼`), contributing \\( 1 + 1 = 2 \\).\n- **Column 1**: `🌙, 🌼, 🌼, 🐋, 🌙, 🌙` has two sequences of length 2 (`🌼🌼` and `🌙🌙`), contributing \\( 1 + 1 = 2 \\).\n- **Column 2**: `🐨, 🐋, 🌙, 🌼, 🌙, 🌼` has no sequences of length ≥2, contributing \\( 0 \\).\n- **Column 3**: `🐋, 🐨, 🐋, 🐋, 🐨, 🐨` has two sequences of length 2 (`🐋🐋` and `🐨🐨`), contributing \\( 1 + 1 = 2 \\).\n- **Column 4**: `🌼, 🐋, 🌼, 🌙, 🌼, 🐋` has no sequences of length ≥2, contributing \\( 0 \\).\n- **Column 5**: `🌼, 🌙, 🌙, 🐨, 🐋, 🌼` has one sequence of length 2 (`🌙🌙`), contributing \\( 1 \\).\n\nTotal vertical lines: \\( 2 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 1 = 7 \\).\n\n### Total Count\nAdding horizontal and vertical lines: \\( 3 + 7 = 10 \\).\n\nAnswer: 10"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

So, the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines made of the same emoji with length 2 or more. Hmm. Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to process each row for horizontal lines and each column for vertical lines. For each possible line in a row or column, check if consecutive emojis are the same and count the lines of length 2 or more.\n\nWait, but how exactly do we count? Like, for a horizontal line in a row, if there's a sequence of k same emojis (k >=2), how many lines does that contribute? Let's see. For example, if a row has \"🐄🐄🐄\", that's a sequence of 3. The possible lines here are: positions 0-1 (length 2), 1-2 (length 2), and 0-1-2 (length 3). Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". So a line is a consecutive sequence of the same emoji, and each such sequence of length L contributes (L - 1) lines? Or does each sequence of length L contribute (L - 1) lines? Wait, let's clarify.\n\nLet's take an example. Suppose a horizontal line has 3 same emojis in a row. Like \"A A A\". Then, the possible lines are:\n\n- The first two (positions 0 and 1) → length 2.\n\n- The last two (positions 1 and 2) → length 2.\n\n- All three (positions 0,1,2) → length 3.\n\nSo for a sequence of length L, the number of lines is (L - 1) + (L - 2) + ... + 1? No, wait no. Because the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So each consecutive run of same emojis of length m contributes (m - 1) lines. Because for m=2, it's 1 line (length 2). For m=3, there's 2 lines: the first two (length 2) and the last two (length 2), plus the three (length 3) → wait, 3 elements: the possible lines are of length 2 and 3. So for m=3, the number of lines is 2 (length 2) + 1 (length 3) = 3. Oh, right! Because a line can be of any length ≥2. So for a run of m consecutive same emojis, the number of lines is (m - 1) + (m - 2) + ... + 1? Wait, no. Let's think again.\n\nFor a run of m elements, the possible lines are all consecutive subarrays of length ≥2. The number of such subarrays is (m - 1) + (m - 2) + ... + 1? No, no. The number of consecutive subarrays of length exactly k in a run of m elements is (m - k + 1). So for k ≥2, sum from k=2 to k=m of (m -k +1).\n\nWhich is sum_{k=2}^m (m -k +1) = sum_{i=1}^{m-1} i} → because when k=2, i = m-2+1= m-1? Wait, let's substitute i = m -k +1. When k=2, i= m-2 +1 = m-1. When k=m, i= m -m +1=1. So the sum becomes 1 + 2 + ... + (m-1) = (m-1)*m\/2. Oh right! Because the sum from 1 to (m-1) is (m-1)*m\/2.\n\nWait, example 1: m=2. Then sum from k=2 to 2 of (2-2+1)=1. Which is (2-1)*2\/2= 1*2\/2=1. Correct.\n\nExample 2: m=3. Sum from k=2 to 3: (3-2+1)=2 (for k=2) and (3-3+1)=1 (for k=3). Sum is 2+1=3. Which is (3-1)*3\/2=2*3\/2=3. Correct.\n\nExample 3: m=4. k=2: 3, k=3: 2, k=4:1. Sum 3+2+1=6. (4-1)*4\/2=3*4\/2=6. Correct.\n\nSo yes, a run of m same emojis (consecutive) contributes (m*(m-1))\/2 lines.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each row in the board, scan horizontally, find all consecutive runs of the same emoji. For each run of length m ≥2, add (m*(m-1))\/2 to the total.\n\n2. For each column in the board, scan vertically, find all consecutive runs of the same emoji. For each run of length m ≥2, add (m*(m-1))\/2 to the total.\n\nSo, first, let's process the rows.\n\nThe board is given as 10 rows (since each line is a row). Let's check:\n\nRow 0: 🐄🐶🐄🐗🐷🐷🐗🐶🐗🐷 → 10 elements.\n\nRow 1: 🐄🐗🐶🐄🐷🐄🐶🐄🦥🐻 → 10.\n\nRow 2: 🐷🦥🐗🐻🦥🐗🐶🌗🐗🐗 → 10.\n\nRow 3: 🐄🐶🐓🐷🌗🐓🐓🌗🐻🐶 → 10.\n\nRow 4: 🦥🐶🐗🐻🐓🌗🐓🐻🐗🐗 → 10.\n\nRow 5: 🐷🦥🌗🦥🐓🐷🐄🐗🌗🌗 → 10.\n\nRow 6: 🌗🐓🐓🐗🐗🐻🐓🐗🐄🐻 → 10.\n\nRow 7: 🐓🐻🐷🌗🐄🐓🌗🦥🐗🐓 → 10.\n\nRow 8: 🐄🐶🐻🦥🐶🐷🐷🐓🐗🦥 → 10.\n\nRow 9: 🐓🐷🐻🦥🐷🐻🐷🌗🐷🐶 → 10.\n\nSo 10 rows, each 10 columns. So 10 rows, 10 columns.\n\nProcessing rows:\n\nLet's process each row one by one.\n\nRow 0: 🐄🐶🐄🐗🐷🐷🐗🐶🐗🐷\n\nLet's list the emojis in order:\n\n0: 🐄\n\n1: 🐶\n\n2: 🐄\n\n3: 🐗\n\n4: 🐷\n\n5: 🐷\n\n6: 🐗\n\n7: 🐶\n\n8: 🐗\n\n9: 🐷\n\nLooking for consecutive runs (same emoji):\n\nCheck each position:\n\n- pos 0: 🐄.

A line is defined as a consecutive sequence of the same emoji with a length of at least 2. For each such sequence of length \\( m \\), the number of valid lines it contributes is \\( \\frac{m \\times (m - 1)}{2} \\), which accounts for all possible sub-sequences of length 2 or more within the sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Horizontal Lines**: For each row, identify consecutive sequences of the same emoji. For each sequence of length \\( m \\geq 2 \\), add \\( \\frac{m \\times (m - 1)}{2} \\) to the total count.\n2. **Vertical Lines**: For each column, identify consecutive sequences of the same emoji.

The task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines of the same emoji with length 2 or more. Hmm. So first, I need to go through each row and each column, check for consecutive same emojis, and count each such line. But wait, how exactly do we count overlapping lines? Like, if there's a sequence of 3 same emojis, how many lines does that contribute? Let's think. For a horizontal line of 3 same emojis in a row, like A A A, the possible lines of length ≥2 are: positions 1-2, 2-3, and 1-3? Or wait, no. Because a line is a consecutive sequence of same emojis. So for a sequence of length n (n ≥2), the number of such lines is (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1? No, wait, that's not right. Wait, maybe the problem counts each maximal consecutive sequence and counts how many lines of length ≥2 are in it. Or perhaps, each line is a run of 2 or more same emojis. For example, a run of 3 same emojis (like A A A) is considered as one line of length 3. Or maybe each possible consecutive pair. Let's clarify.\n\nThe problem statement says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So a line is a consecutive sequence (horizontal or vertical) of the same emoji where the length is 2 or more. So for a horizontal row like [A, A, A], there's a horizontal line of length 3. Similarly, a row like [A, A, B, B] has two horizontal lines (each of length 2). But wait, what about a longer run? Like [A, A, A, A]. That's a single line of length 4. So each maximal consecutive sequence of the same emoji (length ≥2) counts as 1 line. Because a line is the entire consecutive sequence. Because otherwise, if you have a run of 3, you could have two overlapping lines (positions 0-1, 1-2, 0-2), but the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with length of 2 or more\". So perhaps each maximal run (i.e., the longest possible consecutive same emojis) of length ≥2 counts as one line.\n\nWait, let's check the example. Let's imagine a small board. For example:\n\nRow 1: A A A → 1 horizontal line (length 3)\nRow 2: B B C C → 2 horizontal lines (each length 2)\nColumn 1 (vertical): A B → 1 vertical line (length 2)\nSo total would be 1+2+1=4.\n\nAlternatively, if a run of 3 counts as 2 lines (since 3-1=2), then the first row would contribute 2. But the problem statement isn't clear. Let's re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe question says: \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\"\n\nSo, a \"line\" here is a consecutive sequence (horizontal or vertical) of the same emoji, where the length is at least 2. So each such consecutive sequence (of length ≥2) is a line. So, a run of 3 same emojis (horizontal) is one line of length 3. A run of 4 same emojis is one line of length 4. Each of these counts as 1. Because the line is the entire consecutive sequence.\n\nSo for example, in a row like [A, A, A], that's one horizontal line. In a row [A, A, B, B, B], that's two horizontal lines (A's length 2, B's length 3). Similarly, in a column, if there are three consecutive same emojis, that's one vertical line.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each row in the board, scan horizontally, find all consecutive runs of the same emoji with length ≥2. Each such run is counted as 1.\n\n2. For each column in the board, scan vertically, find all consecutive runs of the same emoji with length ≥2. Each such run is counted as 1.\n\nSum all these runs (horizontal and vertical) to get the total.\n\nSo the steps I need to take:\n\nFirst, process each row (horizontal direction):\n\nFor each row in the board:\n\n- Iterate through the row, track the current emoji and the current run length.\n\n- When the next emoji is the same as current, increment run length.\n\n- When it's different, check if the run length was ≥2. If yes, increment the count. Then reset current emoji and run length.\n\n- Also, after the row ends, check if the last run was ≥2 and count it.\n\nThen, process each column (vertical direction):\n\nFor each column index (from 0 to width-1):\n\n- Iterate through each row in the column, track current emoji and run length.\n\n- Similar to the row processing: when the next emoji (in the next row) is same, increment run length. When different, check if run length ≥2, count it. Reset.\n\n- After processing all rows in the column, check the last run.\n\nSum all horizontal and vertical counts.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given board.\n\nFirst, let's write down the board as rows. Let's index rows from 0 to 6 (since there are 7 rows). Each row has 7 emojis (columns 0-6).\n\nRow 0: 🦐, 🦃, 🦃, 🕷, 🦃, 🐥, 🎁 → [0][0] to [0][6]\n\nRow 1: 🦐, 🐥, 🐥, 🐥, 🐥, 🐥, 🕷 → [1][0] to [1][6]\n\nRow 2: 🦃, 🐥, 🦐, 🐥, 🦃, 🦐, 🎁 → [2][0] to [2][6]\n\nRow 3: 🦜, 🕷, 🐥, 🐥, 🐥, 🎁, 🦐 → [3][0] to [3][6]\n\nRow 4: 🎁, 🦜, 🦐, 🦐, 🐥, 🕷, 🐥 → [4][0] to [4][6]\n\nRow 5: 🦐, 🎁, 🦐, 🦜, 🦃, 🎁, 🦐 → [5][0] to [5][6]\n\nRow 6: 🐥, 🎁, 🕷, 🦃, 🕷, 🦃, 🕷 → [6][0] to [6][6]\n\nLet's process horizontal lines first.\n\nProcessing each row:\n\nRow 0: 🦐, 🦃, 🦃, 🕷, 🦃, 🐥, 🎁\n\nCheck consecutive runs:\n\n- Start with 🦐 (index 0). Next (index 1) is 🦃 → different. Run length 1 (not ≥2). So no count.\n\n- Next emoji at index 1: 🦃. Next (index 2) is 🦃 → same. Run length 2. Next (index 3) is 🕷 → different. So run of 🦃 from 1-2 (length 2). Count +=1.\n\n- Next emoji at index 3: 🕷. Next (index4) is 🦃 → different. Run length 1. No count.\n\n- Next emoji at index4: 🦃. Next (index5) is 🐥 → different. Run length 1. No count.\n\n- Next emoji at index5: 🐥. Next (index6) is 🎁 → different. Run length 1. No count.\n\n- Last emoji at index6: 🎁. Run length 1. No count.\n\nTotal for row 0: 1 (the 🦃🦃 at positions 1-2).\n\nRow 1: 🦐, 🐥, 🐥, 🐥, 🐥, 🐥, 🕷\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- Start with 🦐 (index0). Next (index1) is 🐥 → different. Run length 1. No count.\n\n- Next emoji index1: 🐥. Next (index2) 🐥 → same (run 2). index3: 🐥 (run3), index4: 🐥 (run4), index5: 🐥 (run5). index6: 🕷 → different. So the run is from 1-5 (indices 1 to 5 inclusive), length 5 (5-1+1=5). Since 5 ≥2, count +=1.\n\n- Then index6: 🕷. Run length 1. No count.\n\nTotal row 1: 1 (the 5 🐥s).\n\nRow 2: 🦃, 🐥, 🦐, 🐥, 🦃, 🦐, 🎁\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- index0: 🦃. index1: 🐥 → different. Run 1. No.\n\n- index1: 🐥. index2: 🦐 → different. Run 1.

Correct.\n\nTotal 4+7=11.\n\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, where each line has a length of 2 or more. A line is defined as a consecutive sequence of the same emoji in either the horizontal (row) or vertical (column) direction.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Horizontal Lines**: For each row in the board, identify consecutive sequences of the same emoji with length ≥ 2. Each such sequence is counted as one horizontal line.\n2. **Vertical Lines**: For each column in the board, identify consecutive sequences of the same emoji with length ≥ 2. Each such sequence is counted as one vertical line.\n\n### Solution Code\nWe process each row and column to count the valid lines:\n\n#### Horizontal Lines:\n- **Row 0**: `🦐, 🦃, 🦃, 🕷, 🦃, 🐥, 🎁` → 1 line (🦃🦃).\n- **Row 1**: `🦐, 🐥, 🐥, 🐥, 🐥, 🐥, 🕷` → 1 line (🐥🐥🐥🐥🐥).\n- **Row 2**: `🦃, 🐥, 🦐, 🐥, 🦃, 🦐, 🎁` → 0 lines.\n- **Row 3**: `🦜, 🕷, 🐥, 🐥, 🐥, 🎁, 🦐` → 1 line (🐥🐥🐥).\n- **Row 4**: `🎁, 🦜, 🦐, 🦐, 🐥, 🕷, 🐥` → 1 line (🦐🦐).\n- **Row 5**: `🦐, 🎁, 🦐, 🦜, 🦃, 🎁, 🦐` → 0 lines.\n- **Row 6**: `🐥, 🎁, 🕷, 🦃, 🕷, 🦃, 🕷` → 0 lines.\n\n**Total Horizontal Lines**: \\(1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 4\\).\n\n#### Vertical Lines:\n- **Column 0**: `🦐, 🦐, 🦃, 🦜, 🎁, 🦐, 🐥` → 1 line (🦐🦐).\n- **Column 1**: `🦃, 🐥, 🐥, 🕷, 🦜, 🎁, 🎁` → 2 lines (🐥🐥, 🎁🎁).\n- **Column 2**: `🦃, 🐥, 🦐, 🐥, 🦐, 🦐, 🕷` → 1 line (🦐🦐).\n- **Column 3**: `🕷, 🐥, 🐥, 🐥, 🐥, 🦜, 🦃` → 1 line (🐥🐥🐥🐥).\n- **Column 4**: `🦃, 🐥, 🦃, 🐥, 🐥, 🦃, 🕷` → 1 line (🐥🐥).\n- **Column 5**: `🐥, 🐥, 🦐, 🎁, 🕷, 🎁, 🦃` → 1 line (🐥🐥).\n- **Column 6**: `🎁, 🕷, 🎁, 🦐, 🐥, 🦐, 🕷` → 0 lines.\n\n**Total Vertical Lines**: \\(1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 7\\).\n\n### Final Count\nAdding the horizontal and vertical lines gives the total number of valid lines: \\(4 + 7 = 11\\).\n\nAnswer: 11"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

So, the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines made of the same emoji, where each line has a length of 2 or more. Hmm, right. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to process the given board. Let's see, the board is a 10x10 grid, right? Each row has 10 emojis. So, rows are horizontal, columns are vertical. For each row, I need to check consecutive same emojis in the horizontal direction, and for each column, check consecutive same in vertical direction. Each such consecutive run of length k (k >=2) contributes (k-1) to the total count. Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let's think. For example, if there's a horizontal line of 3 same emojis in a row, like A A A. How many lines are there here? The problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So, the line of 3 has length 3, which is >=2, so that's one line. But wait, maybe the question is counting all possible consecutive sequences of length 2 or more. Let's clarify.\n\nWait, the problem statement says \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So, a line is a consecutive sequence of the same emoji, length 2 or longer. Each such sequence is counted once, regardless of length (as long as >=2). So, a run of 2 is 1 line, a run of 3 is 1 line, a run of 4 is 1 line, etc. Because it's a single line of that length.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to check. Let's take an example. Suppose a row has \"A A A\". Then, the horizontal lines here are: positions (row, col1-col2), (row, col2-col3), (row, col1-col3)? No, no. No, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". So, a line is a consecutive sequence of the same emoji of length >=2. So, \"A A A\" is a single line of length 3, which counts as 1. Similarly, \"A A\" is a line of length 2, counts as 1. \"A A B B\" would have two lines (each of length 2). So, the approach is: for each row, scan from left to right, find consecutive runs of the same emoji. For each run of length L >=2, add 1 to the count. Do the same for each column, scanning top to bottom.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each row in the board, check horizontal runs. For each run of same emoji with length >=2, increment count.\n2. For each column in the board, check vertical runs. For each run of same emoji with length >=2, increment count.\n3. Sum all these to get the total.\n\nNow, let's get the board data. Let's list out the board as rows. Let's parse each row. The given board is:\n\nRow 0: ⛅️🦟🌰🌈🌾😃🦚🐑😃🦚\nRow 1: 🦚🐊🌾⛅️🦚🌰🌈⛅️😃⛅️\nRow 2: 🦉🐊🐊😃⛅️🦉🐊😃🦉🦟\nRow 3: 🌾🐊🌾😃🌾😃🐑🦚🌾🐊\nRow 4: 😃⛅️🌈🌾⛅️🌈🐊🐊🦟🌾\nRow 5: ⛅️🦚🌰🌾🌰⛅️🌈🐑🌰🐊\nRow 6: 😃⛅️😃🐊⛅️🌈🦚🦚🌈🌾\nRow 7: 🌾🦉🌰🌈🦚🦉🌈🌾⛅️😃\nRow 8: 🐊🦚🌈🌰🌾🦟🌰🌈🌈⛅️\nRow 9: 🦟⛅️🌈🦟🐑🐊😃🐊🌈🌾\n\nEach row has 10 elements. Let's index rows 0-9, columns 0-9.\n\nFirst, process horizontal lines (rows):\n\nLet's go row by row.\n\nRow 0: ⛅️, 🦟, 🌰, 🌈, 🌾, 😃, 🦚, 🐑, 😃, 🦚\nCheck consecutive same. Let's list the elements:\n\nIndices 0: ⛅️, 1: 🦟 (diff), 2: 🌰 (diff), 3: 🌈 (diff), 4: 🌾 (diff), 5: 😃 (diff), 6: 🦚 (diff), 7: 🐑 (diff), 8: 😃 (diff), 9: 🦚 (diff). All are different from previous. So no horizontal lines here. Count 0.\n\nRow 1: 🦚, 🐊, 🌾, ⛅️, 🦚, 🌰, 🌈, ⛅️, 😃, ⛅️\nCheck each consecutive pair:\n0-1: 🦚 vs 🐊 (diff)\n1-2: 🐊 vs 🌾 (diff)\n2-3: 🌾 vs ⛅️ (diff)\n3-4: ⛅️ vs 🦚 (diff)\n4-5: 🦚 vs 🌰 (diff)\n5-6: 🌰 vs 🌈 (diff)\n6-7: 🌈 vs ⛅️ (diff)\n7-8: ⛅️ vs 😃 (diff)\n8-9: 😃 vs ⛅️ (diff). All different. So 0.\n\nRow 2: 🦉, 🐊, 🐊, 😃, ⛅️, 🦉, 🐊, 😃, 🦉, 🦟\nCheck consecutive:\n0: 🦉\n1: 🐊 (diff)\n2: 🐊 (same as 1). So here, 1-2 are same. Let's track runs. Let's find all runs:\n\nStart at 0: 🦉 (length 1)\nStart at 1: 🐊. Next (2) is 🐊. So run from 1-2 (length 2). Then 3 is 😃 (diff). So this is a run of length 2. Count +=1.\nThen 3: 😃 (length 1)\n4: ⛅️ (diff)\n5: 🦉 (diff)\n6: 🐊 (diff)\n7: 😃 (diff)\n8: 🦉 (diff)\n9: 🦟 (diff). So only one run here (positions 1-2, length 2). So row 2 horizontal count: 1.\n\nRow 3: 🌾, 🐊, 🌾, 😃, 🌾, 😃, 🐑, 🦚, 🌾, 🐊\nCheck runs:\n0: 🌾\n1: 🐊 (diff)\n2: 🌾 (diff)\n3: 😃 (diff)\n4: 🌾 (diff)\n5: 😃 (diff)\n6: 🐑 (diff)\n7: 🦚 (diff)\n8: 🌾 (diff)\n9: 🐊 (diff). All different. So 0.\n\nRow 4: 😃, ⛅️, 🌈, 🌾, ⛅️, 🌈, 🐊, 🐊, 🦟, 🌾\nCheck runs:\n0: 😃\n1: ⛅️ (diff)\n2: 🌈 (diff)\n3: 🌾 (diff)\n4: ⛅️ (diff)\n5: 🌈 (diff)\n6: 🐊. Next (7) is 🐊. So 6-7: length 2. So run here. Count +=1.\nThen 8: 🦟 (diff)\n9: 🌾 (diff). So row 4 horizontal count: 1.\n\nRow 5: ⛅️, 🦚, 🌰, 🌾, 🌰, ⛅️, 🌈, 🐑, 🌰, 🐊\nCheck runs:\n0: ⛅️\n1: 🦚 (diff)\n2: 🌰 (diff)\n3: 🌾 (diff)\n4: 🌰 (diff)\n5: ⛅️ (diff)\n6: 🌈 (diff)\n7: 🐑 (diff)\n8: 🌰 (diff)\n9: 🐊 (diff).

Count +=1.\n8: 🌈 (diff)\n9: 🌾 (diff). So row 6 horizontal count: 1.\n\nRow 7: 🌾, 🦉, 🌰, 🌈, 🦚, 🦉, 🌈, 🌾, ⛅️, 😃\nCheck runs:\n0: 🌾\n1: 🦉 (diff)\n2: 🌰 (diff)\n3: 🌈 (diff)\n4: 🦚 (diff)\n5: 🦉 (diff)\n6: 🌈 (diff)\n7: 🌾 (diff)\n8: ⛅️ (diff)\n9: 😃 (diff).

Count +=1.\n9: ⛅️ (diff). So row 8 horizontal count: 1.\n\nRow 9: 🦟, ⛅️, 🌈, 🦟, 🐑, 🐊, 😃, 🐊, 🌈, 🌾\nCheck runs:\n0: 🦟\n1: ⛅️ (diff)\n2: 🌈 (diff)\n3: 🦟 (diff)\n4: 🐑 (diff)\n5: 🐊 (diff)\n6: 😃 (diff)\n7: 🐊 (diff)\n8: 🌈 (diff)\n9: 🌾 (diff). All different. 0.\n\nSo horizontal lines total: 1 (row2) + 1 (row4) + 1 (row6) + 1 (row8) = 4.\n\nNow, vertical lines (columns). Let's process each column (0-9), check each column for runs of same emoji with length >=2.\n\nLet's list each column. There are 10 columns (0-9). Each column has 10 elements (rows 0-9).\n\nLet's list column 0:\n\nRow 0: ⛅️\nRow 1: 🦚\nRow 2: 🦉\nRow 3: 🌾\nRow 4: 😃\nRow 5: ⛅️\nRow 6: 😃\nRow 7: 🌾\nRow 8: 🐊\nRow 9: 🦟\nCheck for consecutive runs.

Let's process:\n\nStart at 0: 🦟 (length 1)\nRow 1: 🐊. Row 2: 🐊 (same). Row 3: 🐊 (same). So from row 1 to 3: a run of 3 (length 3). So that's a line (length 3 >=2). Count +=1.\nThen row 4: ⛅️ (diff)\nRow 5: 🦚 (diff)\nRow 6: ⛅️ (diff)\nRow 7: 🦉 (diff)\nRow 8: 🦚 (diff)\nRow 9: ⛅️ (diff). So column 1 has 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow 0: 🌰\nRow 1: 🌾\nRow 2: 🐊\nRow 3: 🌾\nRow 4: 🌈\nRow 5: 🌰\nRow 6: 😃\nRow 7: 🌰\nRow 8: 🌈\nRow 9: 🌈\nElements: 🌰, 🌾, 🐊, 🌾, 🌈, 🌰, 😃, 🌰, 🌈, 🌈.\n\nCheck runs:\n\nRow 0: 3️⃣ (🌰)\nRow 1: 🌾 (diff)\nRow 2: 🐊 (diff)\nRow 3: 🌾 (diff)\nRow 4: 🌈 (diff)\nRow 5: 3️⃣ (🌰) (diff from row4)\nRow 6: 😃 (diff)\nRow 7: 3️⃣ (🌰) (diff)\nRow 8: 🌈 (diff)\nRow 9: 🌈 (same as row8). So row8-9: 🌈, 🌈. Length 2. Count +=1.\n\nSo column 2 has 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow 0: 🌈\nRow 1: ⛅️\nRow 2: 😃\nRow 3: 😃\nRow 4: 🌾\nRow 5: 🌾\nRow 6: 🐊\nRow 7: 🌈\nRow 8: 🌰\nRow 9: 🦟\nElements: 🌈, ⛅️, 😃, 😃, 🌾, 🌾, 🐊, 🌈, 🌰, 🦟.\n\nCheck runs:\n\nRow 0: 🌈 (length 1)\nRow 1: ⛅️ (diff)\nRow 2: 😃. Row3: 😃 (same). So run 2-3: length 2. Count +=1.\nRow4: 🌾. Row5: 🌾 (same). Run 4-5: length 2. Count +=1.\nRow6: 🐊 (diff)\nRow7: 🌈 (diff)\nRow8: 🌰 (diff)\nRow9: 🦟 (diff).

So row4 and row6 are ⛅️, but row5 is 🌰. So not consecutive. So row4: ⛅️, row5: 🌰 (diff), row6: ⛅️ (diff from row5). So row6 is ⛅️, which is same as row4 but not consecutive. So no runs here. All elements are different from their next. So 0.\n\nColumn 5:\n\nRow 0: 😃\nRow 1: 🌰\nRow 2: 🦉\nRow 3: 😃\nRow 4: 🌈\nRow 5: ⛅️\nRow 6: 🌈\nRow 7: 🦉\nRow 8: 🦟\nRow 9: 🐊\nElements: 😃, 🌰, 🦉, 😃, 🌈, ⛅️, 🌈, 🦉, 🦟, 🐊.\n\nCheck runs:\n\nRow0: 😃 (diff next)\nRow1: 3️⃣ (🌰) (diff)\nRow2: 🦉 (diff)\nRow3: 😃 (diff)\nRow4: 🌈.

So the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines of the same emoji with length 2 or more. Hmm, let's break this down. \n\nFirst, I need to look at each row (horizontal) and each column (vertical) of the board. For each of these, check consecutive same emojis. Each consecutive run of length L (where L >=2) contributes (L-1) lines. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". So, for example, a horizontal line of 3 same emojis in a row (like A A A) would count as 1 line of length 3, right? Or does it count as 2 lines (since 2-length and 3-length)? Let me re-read the question. Oh, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So a line is a consecutive sequence of the same emoji of length >=2. So for a horizontal run of 3 same emojis, that's one line of length 3. Similarly, a run of 2 is one line. A run of 4 is one line. But wait, wait, maybe the question is counting all possible consecutive sequences of length >=2. Like, for a run of 3 (positions 0-2), there's a line from 0-1 (length 2), 1-2 (length 2), and 0-2 (length 3). So total 3 lines. Oh, but the question says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". Let me clarify. For example, if there's a horizontal row like \"🌙🌙🌙\", how many lines does that count as? Let's think. A line is a consecutive sequence of same emojis. The possible sequences here are: positions 0-1 (length 2), 1-2 (length 2), 0-2 (length 3). So three lines. Because each possible consecutive pair or longer. So for a run of L same emojis, the number of lines is (L*(L-1))\/2. Because for L elements, the number of possible consecutive sequences of length >=2 is sum from k=2 to L of (L -k +1). Which is (L-1) + (L-2) + ... +1 = L(L-1)\/2. Oh right, that's the formula. Because for length 2, there are (L-1) possible starting positions (since 0-1, 1-2, ..., L-2-L-1). For length 3, (L-2) positions, etc., down to 1 for length L. So sum from 1 to (L-1) is (L-1)*L\/2. Wait, no. Let's take L=2: sum from k=2 to 2 is 1 (only 1 sequence). (2-1)*2\/2=1. Correct. L=3: sum is 2 (length 2: 2 sequences) +1 (length 3:1) =3. (3-1)*3\/2=3. Correct. L=4: 3+2+1=6. (4-1)*4\/2=6. Oh right, so the formula is (L*(L-1))\/2. Because (L-1) terms, sum 1+2+...+(L-1) = L(L-1)\/2. So for a run of L same emojis, the number of lines is L*(L-1)\/2.\n\nSo the approach is: for each row and column, scan and find consecutive runs of the same emoji, compute L for each run, then sum (L*(L-1)\/2) for each run where L >=2.\n\nLet's start with the given board. Let's write down the board rows:\n\nRow 0: 🧽 🌱 🌙 🌙 🧽 → [0:🧽, 1:🌱, 2:🌙, 3:🌙, 4:🧽]\n\nRow 1: 🧽 🧽 🌱 🌙 🌙 → [0:🧽, 1:🧽, 2:🌱, 3:🌙, 4:🌙]\n\nRow 2: 🌱 🧽 🧽 🌙 🌙 → [0:🌱, 1:🧽, 2:🧽, 3:🌙, 4:🌙]\n\nRow 3: 🌱 🧽 🌙 🧽 🌙 → [0:🌱, 1:🧽, 2:🌙, 3:🧽, 4:🌙]\n\nRow 4: 🌱 🧽 🧽 🧽 🧽 → [0:🌱, 1:🧽, 2:🧽, 3:🧽, 4:🧽]\n\nNow, let's process each row (horizontal lines first):\n\nRow 0:\nCheck consecutive same emojis. Let's go element by element.\nStart at 0: 🧽. Next is 1: 🌱 (different). So run length 1. No contribution.\n1: 🌱. Next 2: 🌙 (diff). Run length 1. No.\n2: 🌙. Next 3: 🌙 (same). Then 4: 🧽 (diff). So run from 2-3 (length 2). So L=2. Contribution 2*(2-1)\/2=1.\n\nSo row 0 contributes 1.\n\nRow 1:\nCheck elements.\n0: 🧽. Next 1: 🧽 (same). Then 2: 🌱 (diff). So run 0-1 (length 2). Contribution 1.\n2: 🌱. Next 3: 🌙 (diff). Run 1. No.\n3: 🌙. Next 4: 🌙 (same). Run 3-4 (length 2). Contribution 1.\nTotal row 1: 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nRow 2:\nCheck elements.\n0: 🌱. Next 1: 🧽 (diff). Run 1.

So run from 1-4 (length 4). L=4. Contribution 4*3\/2=6.\nSo row 4 contributes 6.\n\nSo total horizontal lines: 1 (row0) + 2 (row1) +2 (row2) +0 (row3) +6 (row4) = 11.\n\nNow vertical lines (columns). Let's process each column (5 columns, 5 rows each).\n\nColumn 0 (row 0 to 4):\nRow 0: 🧽\nRow 1: 🧽\nRow 2: 🌱\nRow 3: 🌱\nRow 4: 🌱\n\nCheck consecutive runs. Let's list the emojis in column 0: [🧽, 🧽, 🌱, 🌱, 🌱]\n\nProcessing:\n\nStart at 0: 🧽. Next 1: 🧽 (same). Then 2: 🌱 (diff). So run 0-1 (length 2). Contribution 1.\n\nThen 2: 🌱. Next 3: 🌱 (same). Next 4: 🌱 (same). So run 2-4 (length 3). L=3. Contribution 3*2\/2=3.\n\nTotal column 0: 1 +3=4.\n\nColumn 1 (row 0 to 4):\nRow 0: 🌱\nRow 1: 🧽\nRow 2: 🧽\nRow 3: 🧽\nRow 4: 🧽\n\nEmojis: [🌱, 🧽, 🧽, 🧽, 🧽]\n\nProcessing:\n\n0: 🌱. Next 1: 🧽 (diff). Run 1. No.\n\n1: 🧽. Next 2: 🧽 (same). Next 3: 🧽 (same). Next 4: 🧽 (same). So run 1-4 (length 4).

So 0.\n\nColumn 2: 0.\n\nColumn 3 (row 0 to 4):\nRow 0: 🌙\nRow 1: 🌙\nRow 2: 🌙\nRow 3: 🧽\nRow 4: 🧽\n\nEmojis: [🌙, 🌙, 🌙, 🧽, 🧽]\n\nProcessing:\n\n0: 🌙. Next 1: 🌙 (same). Next 2: 🌙 (same). Then 3: 🧽 (diff). Run 0-2 (length 3). Contribution 3*2\/2=3.\n\n3: 🧽. Next 4: 🧽 (same). Run 3-4 (length 2).

Contribution 3*2\/2=3.\n\nColumn 4: 3.\n\nSo vertical lines sum: 4 (col0) +6 (col1) +0 (col2) +4 (col3) +3 (col4) = 17.\n\nTotal lines (horizontal + vertical) is 11 +17 = 28.\n\nWait, let me check again.\n\nWait, horizontal sum: 1 (row0) + 2 (row1) + 2 (row2) + 0 (row3) +6 (row4) = 1+2=3, 3+2=5, 5+0=5, 5+6=11. Correct.\n\nVertical sum: 4 (col0) +6 (col1)=10, +0=10, +4=14, +3=17. 14+3=17. Correct.\n\nTotal 11+17=28. Let me double-check each row and column.\n\nRechecking row 0: elements are 🧽,🌱,🌙,🌙,🧽. The runs are 🌙,🌙 (length 2). So 2*1\/2=1. Correct.\n\nRow 1: 🧽,🧽 (length 2 → 1) and 🌙,🌙 (length 2 →1). Sum 2. Correct.\n\nRow 2: 🧽,🧽 (length 2 →1) and 🌙,🌙 (length 2 →1). Sum 2. Correct.\n\nRow 3: all different. 0. Correct.\n\nRow4: 🧽,🧽,🧽,🧽 (length 4). 4*3\/2=6. Correct.\n\nSo horizontal sum 11.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 0: [🧽,🧽,🌱,🌱,🌱]. The runs are:\n\n🧽,🧽 (length 2 →1), 🌱,🌱,🌱 (length 3 →3). 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nColumn 1: [🌱,🧽,🧽,🧽,🧽]. Run is 🧽,🧽,🧽,🧽 (length 4 →6). 6. Correct.\n\nColumn 2: [🌙,🌱,🧽,🌙,🧽]. All different. 0. Correct.\n\nColumn 3: [🌙,🌙,🌙,🧽,🧽]. Run 🌙,🌙,🌙 (length 3 →3) and 🧽,🧽 (length 2 →1). 3+1=4. Correct.\n\nColumn 4: [🧽,🌙,🌙,🌙,🧽]. Run 🌙,🌙,🌙 (length 3 →3). 3. Correct.\n\nSo vertical sum 4+6+0+4+3=17. 17+11=28. That's the total.\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, where each line has a length of 2 or more.

The task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines of the same emoji with length 2 or more. So first, I need to go through each row and column, check consecutive same emojis, and count each such line. But wait, how exactly do we count them? Like, for a horizontal line of length 3, how many lines does that contribute? Let's think.\n\nFor example, a horizontal sequence like \"A A A\" (length 3). The possible lines of length 2 or more here are the first two A's (positions 0-1), the next two (1-2), and the entire three (0-2). Wait no, wait. Wait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So each contiguous segment of the same emoji of length L contributes (L-1) lines. Because a segment of length 2 has 1 line (itself), length 3 has 2 (positions 0-1 and 1-2, but wait no. Wait, maybe I need to count the number of consecutive pairs. Or perhaps, the number of possible sequences of length 2 or more. Let's clarify.\n\nSuppose in a row, there's a horizontal line of the same emoji of length 4: positions i, i+1, i+2, i+3. So the possible lines here are:\n\n- i to i+1 (length 2)\n\n- i to i+2 (length 3)\n\n- i to i+3 (length 4)\n\n- i+1 to i+2 (length 2)\n\n- i+1 to i+3 (length 3)\n\n- i+2 to i+3 (length 2)\n\nWait, but that's overlapping. But the problem says \"lines\", which are contiguous sequences. So each such contiguous segment of length L contributes (L*(L-1))\/2 - ( (L-1)*(L-2)\/2 )? No, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of the problem as, for each horizontal and vertical run of the same emoji, count the number of lines of length >=2.\n\nAlternatively, for a run of length L, the number of such lines is (L - 1) + (L - 2) + ... + 1 = L*(L-1)\/2. Because a line of length 2: there are (L-1) possible starting positions (since 2 elements). A line of length 3: (L-2) positions. And so on, up to length L: 1 position. So total for a run of length L is sum from k=1 to L-1 of k. Which is (L-1)*L\/2.\n\nWait, let's take L=2: sum is 1. So 1 line (the 2-length line). For L=3: 2+1=3. So 3 lines. For L=4: 3+2+1=6. That's 6 lines. Let's check with examples.\n\nIf the row is \"A A\", then 1 line. Correct.\n\nIf the row is \"A A A\", then the lines are:\n\n- positions 0-1 (length 2)\n\n- positions 1-2 (length 2)\n\n- positions 0-2 (length 3)\n\nSo that's 3 lines. Which is (3-1)*3\/2 = 3. Correct.\n\nAnother example: \"A A A A\" (L=4). The lines are:\n\nLength 2: (0-1), (1-2), (2-3) → 3\n\nLength 3: (0-2), (1-3) → 2\n\nLength 4: (0-3) → 1\n\nTotal 3+2+1=6, which is (4*3)\/2=6. So yes, the formula is (L*(L-1))\/2 for a run of length L.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor each row (horizontal), scan each row from left to right, find consecutive same emojis, compute the length of the run, and add (L*(L-1))\/2 to the total.\n\nSimilarly, for each column (vertical), scan each column from top to bottom, find consecutive same emojis, compute the length of the run, and add (L*(L-1))\/2 to the total.\n\nYes, that's the correct approach.\n\nSo now, let's process the given board.\n\nFirst, let's write down the board as rows. Let's index rows from 0 to 9 (since there are 10 rows), each row has 10 elements (columns 0-9).\n\nLet's list all rows:\n\nRow 0: 🌊, 🌺, 🌚, 🪐, ✨, 🌺, 🌚, 🌹, 🍃, 🌊\n\nRow 1: 🦟, 🪐, 🌊, 🌺, 🌊, 🍃, 🌹, 🌚, 🍃, 🍃\n\nRow 2: 🐚, 🐚, 🌊, 🍃, 🪐, 🦗, 🪐, 🌊, 🐚, 🌹\n\nRow 3: 🐚, ✨, 🪐, 🍃, 🌚, 🪐, ✨, 🦟, 🌹, 🌚\n\nRow 4: ✨, 🦗, 🐚, 🌹, ✨, 🍃, 🌚, 🌊, 🌚, 🦟\n\nRow 5: 🌚, ✨, 🦟, 🌚, 🍃, 🍃, 🐚, 🐚, 🍃, 🪐\n\nRow 6: 🦟, 🦟, 🦟, 🌚, 🌊, 🐚, ✨, 🦗, 🌚, ✨\n\nRow 7: 🦗, 🍃, 🦟, 🌚, 🌺, 🐚, 🌚, 🍃, 🍃, 🪐\n\nRow 8: 🪐, 🌺, 🌹, 🐚, 🪐, 🌹, 🐚, 🌺, 🦟, 🦟\n\nRow 9: 🌚, 🦟, 🦟, 🐚, 🍃, ✨, 🌊, ✨, 🍃, 🐚\n\nNow, process each row for horizontal runs.\n\nLet's process row 0: 🌊, 🌺, 🌚, 🪐, ✨, 🌺, 🌚, 🌹, 🍃, 🌊\n\nEach emoji is different from the next. So all runs are length 1. So 0.\n\nRow 0 horizontal contribution: 0.\n\nRow 1: 🦟, 🪐, 🌊, 🌺, 🌊, 🍃, 🌹, 🌚, 🍃, 🍃\n\nCheck consecutive elements:\n\n0: 🦟. Next is 🪐 (diff). Run length 1.\n\n1: 🪐.

That's correct.\n\nVertical columns:\n\nColumn 0:1 →1.\n\nColumn1:0 →1.\n\nColumn2:4 (row1-2:1, row5-6-7:3) → 4. 1+3=4. So 1 (current 1) +4=5.\n\nColumn3:5 (row2-3:1, row5-6-7:3, row8-9:1) → 1+3+1=5. 5+5=10.\n\nColumn4:0 →10.\n\nColumn5:2 (row4-5:1, row6-7:1) →2. 10+2=12.\n\nColumn6:0 →12.\n\nColumn7:0 →12.\n\nColumn8:1 (row0-1:1) →1. 12+1=13.\n\nColumn9:0 →13. Correct.\n\nTotal 10+13=23.\n\nSo the answer is 23.\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more in a given rectangular board. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Horizontal Lines**: For each row, scan from left to right to identify contiguous segments of the same emoji. For a segment of length \\( L \\), the number of valid lines (length ≥ 2) is given by \\( \\frac{L \\times (L - 1)}{2} \\). This formula accounts for all possible sub-segments of length 2 or more within the contiguous segment.\n2. **Vertical Lines**: For each column, scan from top to bottom to identify contiguous segments of the same emoji. Use the same formula \\( \\frac{L \\times (L - 1)}{2} \\) to count valid lines for each segment.\n\n### Solution Code\nThe board is processed row by row for horizontal lines and column by column for vertical lines. Each contiguous segment of the same emoji is analyzed, and the number of valid lines is summed up.\n\n### Calculations\n#### Horizontal Lines:\n- **Row 0**: All emojis are distinct. Contribution: 0.\n- **Row 1**: A segment of length 2 (positions 8-9). Contribution: \\( \\frac{2 \\times 1}{2} = 1 \\).\n- **Row 2**: A segment of length 2 (positions 0-1). Contribution: \\( \\frac{2 \\times 1}{2} = 1 \\).\n- **Row 3**: All emojis are distinct. Contribution: 0.\n- **Row 4**: All emojis are distinct. Contribution: 0.\n- **Row 5**: Two segments of length 2 (positions 4-5 and 6-7). Contribution: \\( 1 + 1 = 2 \\).\n- **Row 6**: A segment of length 3 (positions 0-2). Contribution: \\( \\frac{3 \\times 2}{2} = 3 \\).\n- **Row 7**: A segment of length 2 (positions 7-8). Contribution: \\( \\frac{2 \\times 1}{2} = 1 \\).\n- **Row 8**: A segment of length 2 (positions 8-9). Contribution: \\( \\frac{2 \\times 1}{2} = 1 \\).\n- **Row 9**: A segment of length 2 (positions 1-2). Contribution: \\( \\frac{2 \\times 1}{2} = 1 \\).\n\nTotal horizontal contribution: \\( 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10 \\).\n\n#### Vertical Lines:\n- **Column 0**: A segment of length 2 (rows 2-3). Contribution: \\( \\frac{2 \\times 1}{2} = 1 \\).\n- **Column 1**: All emojis are distinct. Contribution: 0.\n- **Column 2**: A segment of length 2 (rows 1-2) and a segment of length 3 (rows 5-7). Contribution: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\).\n- **Column 3**: A segment of length 2 (rows 2-3), a segment of length 3 (rows 5-7), and a segment of length 2 (rows 8-9). Contribution: \\( 1 + 3 + 1 = 5 \\).\n- **Column 4**: All emojis are distinct. Contribution: 0.\n- **Column 5**: Two segments of length 2 (rows 4-5 and 6-7). Contribution: \\( 1 + 1 = 2 \\).\n- **Column 6**: All emojis are distinct. Contribution: 0.\n- **Column 7**: All emojis are distinct. Contribution: 0.\n- **Column 8**: A segment of length 2 (rows 0-1). Contribution: \\( \\frac{2 \\times 1}{2} = 1 \\).\n- **Column 9**: All emojis are distinct. Contribution: 0.\n\nTotal vertical contribution: \\( 1 + 0 + 4 + 5 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 13 \\).\n\n### Final Result\nThe total number of valid lines is the sum of horizontal and vertical contributions: \\( 10 + 13 = 23 \\).\n\nAnswer: 23"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

So, the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines of the same emoji with length 2 or more. Hmm. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to process each row for horizontal lines and each column for vertical lines. For each row, check consecutive same emojis. For each such consecutive sequence of length L, the number of lines is L-1. Because, for example, a sequence of 3 same emojis has 2 lines (positions 1-2 and 2-3). Similarly for vertical.\n\nLet me start by writing down the board. The board is 10x10, right? Let's list each row first. Let's index rows from 0 to 9, and columns 0 to 9.\n\nRow 0: 🦚, 🐆, 🐕, 🌷, 🌹, 🐆, 🌕, 🦚, 🦢, 🌕\nRow 1: 🦢, 🐕, 🌹, 🐆, 🐕, 🐊, 🌷, 🦢, 😄, 🐊\nRow 2: 🌹, 🌹, 🌷, 🐕, 🐊, 😄, 🦚, 🐊, 😄, 🌕\nRow 3: 🌷, 🦢, 🐆, 🌷, 🌕, 🌹, 🌷, 🌕, 🌷, 🐊\nRow 4: 😄, 🐆, 😄, 🐆, 🦚, 🦚, 🐆, 😄, 🌷, 🌹\nRow 5: 🐊, 🐕, 🦇, 🦢, 🦢, 😄, 🦇, 🐊, 🦇, 🐕\nRow 6: 🦢, 🦢, 🦢, 🌷, 🐆, 🌷, 🌕, 🌹, 😄, 😄\nRow 7: 🌹, 🌷, 🌹, 🐕, 😄, 🌹, 😄, 🐕, 🐆, 🐊\nRow 8: 🌷, 🐕, 🌕, 🐊, 🦇, 🌹, 😄, 🦇, 🦚, 🦢\nRow 9: 🐆, 🌹, 🌷, 🦚, 🦢, 🐕, 🦢, 🦇, 🦚, 🦚\n\nFirst, let's process horizontal lines (each row):\n\nRow 0: Let's check consecutive same emojis.\nLooking at each element:\n0: 🦚 (diff from next 🐆)\n1: 🐆 (diff from 🐕)\n2: 🐕 (diff from 🌷)\n3: 🌷 (diff from 🌹)\n4: 🌹 (diff from 🐆)\n5: 🐆 (diff from 🌕)\n6: 🌕 (diff from 🦚)\n7: 🦚 (diff from 🦢)\n8: 🦢 (diff from 🌕)\nSo row 0 has 0 horizontal lines.\n\nRow 1: Check each consecutive pair.\n0: 🦢 vs 1: 🐕 → no.\n1: 🐕 vs 2: 🌹 → no.\n2: 🌹 vs 3: 🐆 → no.\n3: 🐆 vs 4: 🐕 → no.\n4: 🐕 vs 5: 🐊 → no.\n5: 🐊 vs 6: 🌷 → no.\n6: 🌷 vs 7: 🦢 → no.\n7: 🦢 vs 8: 😄 → no.\n8: 😄 vs 9: 🐊 → no. So row 1: 0.\n\nRow 2: Let's look.\n0: 🌹, 1: 🌹 → same. So that's a pair. Then 1: 🌹 vs 2: 🌷 → different. So sequence of 2 (positions 0-1). So contributes 1 (since 2-1=1).\nOther elements: 2: 🌷 vs 3: 🐕 → no. 3: 🐕 vs 4: 🐊 → no. 4: 🐊 vs 5: 😄 → no. 5: 😄 vs 6: 🦚 → no. 6: 🦚 vs 7: 🐊 → no. 7: 🐊 vs 8: 😄 → no. 8: 😄 vs 9: 🌕 → no. So row 2 contributes 1.\n\nRow 3: Check each consecutive.\n0: 🌷 vs 1: 🦢 → no. 1: 🦢 vs 2: 🐆 → no. 2: 🐆 vs 3: 🌷 → no. 3: 🌷 vs 4: 🌕 → no. 4: 🌕 vs 5: 🌹 → no. 5: 🌹 vs 6: 🌷 → no. 6: 🌷 vs 7: 🌕 → no. 7: 🌕 vs 8: 🌷 → no. 8: 🌷 vs 9: 🐊 → no. So 0.\n\nRow 4: Let's check.\n0: 😄 vs 1: 🐆 → no. 1: 🐆 vs 2: 😄 → no. 2: 😄 vs 3: 🐆 → no. 3: 🐆 vs 4: 🦚 → no. 4: 🦚 vs 5: 🦚 → same. So 4-5 is a pair. Then 5: 🦚 vs 6: 🐆 → different. So sequence length 2, contributes 1. 6: 🐆 vs 7: 😄 → no. 7: 😄 vs 8: 🌷 → no. 8: 🌷 vs 9: 🌹 → no. So row 4: 1.\n\nRow 5: Let's check.\n0: 🐊 vs 1: 🐕 → no. 1: 🐕 vs 2: 🦇 → no. 2: 🦇 vs 3: 🦢 → no. 3: 🦢 vs 4: 🦢 → same. So 3-4: pair. 4: 🦢 vs 5: 😄 → different. So 1. 5: 😄 vs 6: 🦇 → no. 6: 🦇 vs 7: 🐊 → no. 7: 🐊 vs 8: 🦇 → no. 8: 🦇 vs 9: 🐕 → no. So row 5: 1.\n\nRow 6: Let's check.\n0: 🦢 vs 1: 🦢 → same. 1: 🦢 vs 2: 🦢 → same. So sequence 0-1-2: length 3. So contributes 2 (3-1=2). Then 2: 🦢 vs 3: 🌷 → different. 3: 🌷 vs 4: 🐆 → no. 4: 🐆 vs 5: 🌷 → no. 5: 🌷 vs 6: 🌕 → no. 6: 🌕 vs 7: 🌹 → no. 7: 🌹 vs 8: 😄 → no. 8: 😄 vs 9: 😄 → same. So 8-9: pair.

So row 6 total: 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nRow 7: Check each.\n0: 🌹 vs 1: 🌷 → no. 1: 🌷 vs 2: 🌹 → no. 2: 🌹 vs 3: 🐕 → no. 3: 🐕 vs 4: 😄 → no. 4: 😄 vs 5: 🌹 → no. 5: 🌹 vs 6: 😄 → no. 6: 😄 vs 7: 🐕 → no. 7: 🐕 vs 8: 🐆 → no. 8: 🐆 vs 9: 🐊 → no.

So 0.\n\nRow 9: Check each.\n0: 🐆 vs 1: 🌹 → no. 1: 🌹 vs 2: 🌷 → no. 2: 🌷 vs 3: 🦚 → no. 3: 🦚 vs 4: 🦢 → no. 4: 🦢 vs 5: 🐕 → no. 5: 🐕 vs 6: 🦢 → no. 6: 🦢 vs 7: 🦇 → no. 7: 🦇 vs 8: 🦚 → no. 8: 🦚 vs 9: 🦚 → same. So 8-9: pair. Contributes 1. So row 9: 1.\n\nSo total horizontal lines: 0 (row0) + 0 (row1) + 1 (row2) + 0 (row3) +1 (row4) +1 (row5) +3 (row6) +0 (row7) +0 (row8) +1 (row9) = 1+1+1+3+1= 7.\n\nNow vertical lines.

Let's recount column 8. Column 8:\n\nRow0: 🦢 (index 0)\nRow1: 😄 (1)\nRow2: 😄 (2) → 1-2: same, so 1 line.\nRow3: 🌷 (3)\nRow4: 🌷 (4) → 3-4: same, 1 line.\nRow5: 🦇 (5)\nRow6: 😄 (6)\nRow7: 🐆 (7)\nRow8: 🦚 (8)\nRow9: 🦚 (9) → 8-9: same, 1 line. So 1+1+1=3. Correct.\n\nColumn 5: row7 and row8: 🌹. Let's check row7 column5: 🌹 (row7: \"🌹, 🌷, 🌹, 🐕, 😄, 🌹, 😄, 🐕, 🐆, 🐊\" → column5 is 🌹 (index5). row8 column5: \"🌷, 🐕, 🌕, 🐊, 🦇, 🌹, 😄, 🦇, 🦚, 🦢\" → column5 is 🌹. So row7 and row8, column5: 🌹 and 🌹. So 7-8: same. Contributes 1. Correct.\n\nColumn 6: row7 column6: 😄. row8 column6: 😄. row7: \"🌹, 🌷, 🌹, 🐕, 😄, 🌹, 😄, 🐕, 🐆, 🐊\" → column6 is 😄. row8: \"🌷, 🐕, 🌕, 🐊, 🦇, 🌹, 😄, 🦇, 🦚, 🦢\" → column6 is 😄. So 7-8: same. 1 line. Correct.\n\nColumn 7: row8 column7: 🦇. row9 column7: 🦇. row8: \"🌷, 🐕, 🌕, 🐊, 🦇, 🌹, 😄, 🦇, 🦚, 🦢\" → column7 is 🦇. row9: \"🐆, 🌹, 🌷, 🦚, 🦢, 🐕, 🦢, 🦇, 🦚, 🦚\" → column7 is 🦇. So 8-9: same. 1 line. Correct.\n\nSo vertical lines sum 1+1+1+3=6. Horizontal sum 7. 7+6=13. That's the total.\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more on a 10x10 board. A line of length \\( L \\) contributes \\( L-1 \\) to the total count (e.g., a line of 3 consecutive emojis contributes 2 lines).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Horizontal Lines**: For each row, check consecutive emojis. For each sequence of \\( L \\) consecutive identical emojis, add \\( L-1 \\) to the total count.\n2. **Vertical Lines**: For each column, check consecutive emojis. For each sequence of \\( L \\) consecutive identical emojis, add \\( L-1 \\) to the total count.\n\n### Solution Code\nWe manually analyze each row and column to count valid lines:\n\n#### Horizontal Lines:\n- **Row 0**: No consecutive identical emojis. Contributes 0.\n- **Row 1**: No consecutive identical emojis. Contributes 0.\n- **Row 2**: Two consecutive 🌹 (positions 0-1). Contributes 1.\n- **Row 3**: No consecutive identical emojis. Contributes 0.\n- **Row 4**: Two consecutive 🦚 (positions 4-5). Contributes 1.\n- **Row 5**: Two consecutive 🦢 (positions 3-4). Contributes 1.\n- **Row 6**: Three consecutive 🦢 (positions 0-2) contributing 2, and two consecutive 😄 (positions 8-9) contributing 1. Total: 3.\n- **Row 7**: No consecutive identical emojis. Contributes 0.\n- **Row 8**: No consecutive identical emojis. Contributes 0.\n- **Row 9**: Two consecutive 🦚 (positions 8-9). Contributes 1.\n\nTotal horizontal lines: \\( 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 7 \\).\n\n#### Vertical Lines:\n- **Column 0**: No consecutive identical emojis. Contributes 0.\n- **Column 1**: No consecutive identical emojis. Contributes 0.\n- **Column 2**: No consecutive identical emojis. Contributes 0.\n- **Column 3**: No consecutive identical emojis. Contributes 0.\n- **Column 4**: No consecutive identical emojis. Contributes 0.\n- **Column 5**: Two consecutive 🌹 (rows 7-8). Contributes 1.\n- **Column 6**: Two consecutive 😄 (rows 7-8). Contributes 1.\n- **Column 7**: Two consecutive 🦇 (rows 8-9). Contributes 1.\n- **Column 8**: Two consecutive 😄 (rows 1-2), two consecutive 🌷 (rows 3-4), and two consecutive 🦚 (rows 8-9). Total: 3.\n- **Column 9**: No consecutive identical emojis. Contributes 0.\n\nTotal vertical lines: \\( 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 0 = 6 \\).\n\n### Total Count\nAdding horizontal and vertical lines gives \\( 7 + 6 = 13 \\).\n\nAnswer: 13"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

So the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines of the same emoji with length 2 or more. Hmm. Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to process the board. The board is given as a list of strings (I assume each line is a row). Let's write down the rows first to visualize:\n\nRow 0: 🐋🐺🦆🦏🦑🦟🐋\nRow 1: 🦞🦏🦆🦑🐺🐋🦟\nRow 2: 🦆🦏🐋🦆🦆🦆🦆\nRow 3: 🦟🦆🦞🦑🦞🦏🦆\nRow 4: 🦟🦟🦆🦏🦞🦆🐺\nRow 5: 🐺🦞🦑🦟🦞🦑🦟\nRow 6: 🦑🐋🦟🦆🐺🦆🦑\n\nSo each row has 7 elements (columns 0-6), and there are 7 rows (rows 0-6). So the board is 7x7.\n\nWe need to check horizontal lines (same row, consecutive columns) and vertical lines (same column, consecutive rows) where the same emoji appears in consecutive positions, and the length is 2 or more. For each such line, we count it. But wait, how do overlapping lines count? Like, if there's a line of 3 same emojis, that's two lines of length 2 (positions 0-1 and 1-2) and one line of length 3. But wait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". Oh, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's re-read the question.\n\nThe problem says \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So a line here is a consecutive sequence of the same emoji of length >=2. So for a horizontal sequence of 3 same emojis (e.g., positions (row, col) (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6) as in row 2, which is \"🦆🦆🦆🦆\" starting from column 2: let's check row 2. Row 2 is \"🦆🦏🐋🦆🦆🦆🦆\". So columns 0: 🦆, 1: 🦏, 2: 🐋, 3: 🦆, 4: 🦆, 5: 🦆, 6: 🦆. Oh, from column 3 to 6: four 🦆s. So that's a horizontal line of length 4. How many such lines are there here?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem counts each maximal consecutive run as a single line. Because if you have a run of 3, that's one line of length 3. Or maybe, the problem counts all possible consecutive sequences of length >=2. For example, a run of 3 would have (positions 0-1, 1-2, 0-2). But that's 3 possible lines (length 2, 2, 3). But the problem statement says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So I think a line is a consecutive sequence of same emojis where the length is at least 2, and each such sequence is counted once, regardless of how long it is. Because if it's 4 in a row, that's one line of length 4, which is counted once.\n\nWait, let's clarify with an example. Suppose a row has \"AAAB\". Then the horizontal lines would be the \"AAA\" (length 3) and the \"AA\" (positions 0-1 and 1-2) if we count all possible consecutive pairs. But that's ambiguous. Let's look at the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So perhaps a line is a maximal consecutive sequence of the same emoji of length >=2. Because if you have a run of 4, that's a single line. Because otherwise, the count would be higher. Let's think of a small example. Suppose a row is \"AA\". Then it's one line. If it's \"AAA\", that's a single line (length 3). If it's \"AABBB\", then \"AA\" (length 2) and \"BBB\" (length 3) → 2 lines. That makes sense.\n\nYes, that's the correct approach. Because a \"line\" here refers to a consecutive run of the same emoji of length at least 2. So each such run is counted once. So the steps are:\n\nFor each row, check all horizontal runs (consecutive same emojis in the row). For each run, if the length is >=2, add 1 to the count.\n\nSimilarly, for each column, check all vertical runs (consecutive same emojis in the column). For each run, if the length is >=2, add 1 to the count.\n\nSo now, the plan is:\n\n1. Iterate over each row, check horizontal runs.\n\n2. Iterate over each column, check vertical runs.\n\nLet's start with the horizontal runs.\n\nFirst, process each row:\n\nRow 0: 🐋🐺🦆🦏🦑🦟🐋 → characters are [🐋, 🐺, 🦆, 🦏, 🦑, 🦟, 🐋]. All are different. So no horizontal runs here. So 0.\n\nRow 1: 🦞🦏🦆🦑🐺🐋🦟 → all different. 0.\n\nRow 2: 🦆🦏🐋🦆🦆🦆🦆 → Let's list the characters: [🦆, 🦏, 🐋, 🦆, 🦆, 🦆, 🦆]. Let's find consecutive runs.\n\n- Start at 0: 🦆. Next is 🦏 (different). So run length 1.\n\n- 1: 🦏. Next is 🐋 (different). Run length 1.\n\n- 2: 🐋. Next is 🦆 (different). Run length 1.\n\n- 3: 🦆. Next is 4: 🦆 (same). Then 5: 🦆 (same), 6: 🦆 (same). So the run starts at 3, ends at 6. Length 4. Since 4 >=2, count 1.\n\nSo row 2 contributes 1 horizontal.\n\nRow 3: 🦟🦆🦞🦑🦞🦏🦆 → [🦟, 🦆, 🦞, 🦑, 🦞, 🦏, 🦆]. All different. 0.\n\nRow 4: 🦟🦟🦆🦏🦞🦆🐺 → [🦟, 🟦 (wait, row 4: \"🦟🦟🦆🦏🦞🦆🐺\" → [🦟, 🦟, 🦆, 🦏, 🦞, 🦆, 🐺]. So:\n\n- 0: 🦟, 1: 🦟 (same). Then 2: 🦆 (different). So run 0-1: length 2. Count 1.\n\nThe rest are different. So row 4 contributes 1 horizontal.\n\nRow 5: 🐺🦞🦑🦟🦞🦑🦟 → [🐺, 🦞, 🦑, 🟦 (wait, row 5: \"🐺🦞🦑🦟🦞🦑🦟\" → [🐺, 🦞, 🦑, 🟦, 🦞, 🟦, 🟦]. Let's check:\n\n- 0: 🐺, 1: 🦞 (diff). 1: 🦞, 2: 🦑 (diff). 2: 🦑, 3: 🟦 (diff). 3: 🟦, 4: 🦞 (diff). 4: 🦞, 5: 🟦 (diff). 5: 🟦, 6: 🟦 (same). So 5-6: length 2. So row 5 has 1 horizontal run (positions 5-6). So 1.\n\nRow 6: 🦑🐋🦟🦆🐺🦆🦑 → [🦑, 🐋, 🟦, 🦆, 🐺, 🦆, 🦑]. All different. 0.\n\nSo horizontal runs total: 1 (row2) +1 (row4) +1 (row5) = 3.\n\nNow vertical runs (columns 0-6, check each column for consecutive runs).\n\nLet's list each column:\n\nColumn 0 (rows 0-6):\n\nRow 0: 🐋\n\nRow 1: 🦞\n\nRow 2: 🦆\n\nRow 3: 🟦\n\nRow 4: 🟦\n\nRow 5: 🐺\n\nRow 6: 🦑\n\nSo [🐋, 🦞, 🦆, 🟦, 🟦, 🐺, 🦑]. Let's check consecutive runs.\n\nRow 3: 🟦, row 4: 🟦. So run from 3 to 4 (length 2). So 1 vertical run here.\n\nColumn 1 (rows 0-6):\n\nRow0: 🐺\n\nRow1: 🦏\n\nRow2: 🦏\n\nRow3: 🦆\n\nRow4: 🟦\n\nRow5: 🦞\n\nRow6: 🐋\n\nSo [🐺, 🦏, 🦏, 🦆, 🟦, 🦞, 🐋].\n\nRow1: 🦏, row2: 🦏 → run length 2. So 1 vertical run.\n\nColumn 2 (rows 0-6):\n\nRow0: 🦆\n\nRow1: 🦆\n\nRow2: 🐋\n\nRow3: 🦞\n\nRow4: 🦆\n\nRow5: 🦑\n\nRow6: 🟦\n\nSo [🦆, 🦆, 🐋, 🦞, 🦆, 🦑, 🟦].\n\nRow0 and row1: 🦆, 🦆 → run length 2. So 1 vertical run.\n\nColumn 3 (rows 0-6):\n\nRow0: 🦏\n\nRow1: 🦑\n\nRow2: 🦆\n\nRow3: 🟦\n\nRow4: 🦏\n\nRow5: 🟦\n\nRow6: 🦆\n\nSo [🦏, 🦑, 🦆, 🟦, 🦏, 🟦, 🦆]. All different. 0.\n\nColumn 4 (rows 0-6):\n\nRow0: 🦑\n\nRow1: 🐺\n\nRow2: 🦆\n\nRow3: 🦞\n\nRow4: 🦞\n\nRow5: 🦞\n\nRow6: 🐺\n\nSo [🦑, 🐺, 🦆, 🦞, 🦞, 🦞, 🐺].\n\nRow3: 🦞, row4: 🦞, row5: 🦞. So run from 3 to 5. Length 3. So 1 vertical run.\n\nColumn 5 (rows 0-6):\n\nRow0: 🟦\n\nRow1: 🐋\n\nRow2: 🦆\n\nRow3: 🦏\n\nRow4: 🦆\n\nRow5: 🟦\n\nRow6: 🦆\n\nSo [🟦, 🐋, 🦆, 🦏, 🦆, 🟦, 🦆]. Let's check:\n\nRow0: 🟦, row1: 🐋 (diff).

A \"line\" here refers to a consecutive sequence of the same emoji of length ≥2. We check each row for horizontal lines and each column for vertical lines.\n\n### Step 1: Check Horizontal Lines\nWe iterate through each row and identify consecutive sequences of the same emoji with length ≥2.\n\n- **Row 0**: `🐋🐺🦆🦏🦑🦟🐋` → All emojis are unique. No horizontal lines.  \n- **Row 1**: `🦞🦏🦆🦑🐺🐋🦟` → All emojis are unique. No horizontal lines.  \n- **Row 2**: `🦆🦏🐋🦆🦆🦆🦆` → A sequence of 4 consecutive `🦆` (columns 3-6). Counts as 1 horizontal line.  \n- **Row 3**: `🦟🦆🦞🦑🦞🦏🦆` → All emojis are unique. No horizontal lines.  \n- **Row 4**: `🦟🦟🦆🦏🦞🦆🐺` → A sequence of 2 consecutive `🦟` (columns 0-1).

No horizontal lines.  \n\n**Total horizontal lines**: \\(1 + 1 + 1 = 3\\).\n\n### Step 2: Check Vertical Lines\nWe iterate through each column and identify consecutive sequences of the same emoji with length ≥2.\n\n- **Column 0**: `🐋, 🦞, 🦆, 🦟, 🦟, 🐺, 🦑` → A sequence of 2 consecutive `🦟` (rows 3-4). Counts as 1 vertical line.  \n- **Column 1**: `🐺, 🦏, 🦏, 🦆, 🦟, 🦞, 🐋` → A sequence of 2 consecutive `🦏` (rows 1-2).

So the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines of the same emoji with length 2 or more. Hmm. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, I need to look at each row (horizontal) and each column (vertical) and check for consecutive same emojis. For each such consecutive sequence of length k (where k >=2), how many lines does it contribute? Oh right, because a sequence of length k has (k-1) possible lines of length 2, (k-2) of length 3, etc. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So a line is a consecutive run of the same emoji. For example, if there's a horizontal line of 3 🌏s, that's one line of length 3. So each consecutive run of same emojis with length >=2 counts as one line, regardless of longer lengths. Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck the problem statement. Oh, the question says \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So each such consecutive sequence (run) of same emojis, length >=2, counts as 1 line. Because a run of 3 🌏s is a single horizontal line of length 3, which is >=2, so it's counted once. Similarly, a run of 2 🌏s is counted once. \n\nSo the approach is: for each row, scan left to right, find all consecutive runs of the same emoji with length >=2, count each as 1. Then do the same for each column, scan top to bottom, find consecutive runs of same emoji with length >=2, count each as 1. Then sum all these counts.\n\nSo let's start with the rows first. Let's list out each row and check.\n\nThe board is given as:\n\nRow 0: 🌏🌏🌏🐔🐟🌏\nRow 1: 🐟🐟🐟🐔🌏☁️\nRow 2: 🌏🌏🌏🌏☁️☁️\nRow 3: 🌏☁️🐔🐔🐔🌏\nRow 4: 🐔🐔🌏☁️🐟🐟\nRow 5: 🐟🐔🐔🌏☁️🐔\n\nLet's process each row (horizontal lines):\n\nRow 0: 🌏🌏🌏🐔🐟🌏\nLooking for consecutive same emojis. Let's list the runs:\n- 🌏: length 3 (positions 0-2) → count 1 (since 3 >=2)\n- Then 🐔: length 1 (position 3) → no\n- 🐟: length 1 (position 4) → no\n- 🌏: length 1 (position 5) → no\nSo row 0 contributes 1.\n\nRow 1: 🐟🐟🐟🐔🌏☁️\nRuns:\n- 🐟: length 3 (0-2) → count 1\n- 🐔: length 1 (3) → no\n- 🌏: 1 (4) → no\n- ☁️: 1 (5) → no\nRow 1 contributes 1.\n\nRow 2: 🌏🌏🌏🌏☁️☁️\nRuns:\n- 🌏: 4 (0-3) → count 1\n- ☁️: 2 (4-5) → count 1\nTotal for row 2: 2.\n\nRow 3: 🌏☁️🐔🐔🐔🌏\nRuns:\n- 🌏: 1 (0) → no\n- ☁️: 1 (1) → no\n- 🐔: 3 (2-4) → count 1\n- 🌏: 1 (5) → no\nRow 3 contributes 1.\n\nRow 4: 🐔🐔🌏☁️🐟🐟\nRuns:\n- 🐔: 2 (0-1) → count 1\n- 🌏: 1 (2) → no\n- ☁️: 1 (3) → no\n- 🐟: 2 (4-5) → count 1\nTotal row 4: 2.\n\nRow 5: 🐟🐔🐔🌏☁️🐔\nRuns:\n- 🐟: 1 (0) → no\n- 🐔: 2 (1-2) → count 1\n- 🌏: 1 (3) → no\n- ☁️: 1 (4) → no\n- 🐔: 1 (5) → no\nRow 5 contributes 1.\n\nSo total horizontal lines: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 8.\n\nNow check vertical lines (columns). The board has 6 columns (since each row has 6 elements). Let's list each column from 0 to 5.\n\nColumn 0 (positions [0][0], [1][0], [2][0], [3][0], [4][0], [5][0]):\nRow 0: 🌏\nRow 1: 🐟\nRow 2: 🌏\nRow 3: 🌏\nRow 4: 🐔\nRow 5: 🐟\nSo the emojis are: 🌏, 🐟, 🌏, 🌏, 🐔, 🐟 → let's check runs:\nLooking for consecutive same emojis. Let's go step by step:\nRow 0: 🌏 (current emoji 🌏, count 1)\nRow 1: 🐟 (different, so previous run 🌏 length 1 → no. Now current 🐟, count 1)\nRow 2: 🌏 (different, run 🐟 length 1 → no. Current 🌏, count 1)\nRow 3: 🌏 (same as current. Count 2 → since 2 >=2, this is a run. So count 1. Then current 🌏, count 2)\nRow 4: 🐔 (different. Previous run 🌏 length 2 → counted. Now current 🐔, count 1)\nRow 5: 🐟 (different. Run 🐔 length 1 → no. Current 🐟, count 1)\nSo column 0 has 1 vertical line (the 🌏 in rows 2 and 3, length 2).\n\nColumn 1 (positions [0][1], [1][1], [2][1], [3][1], [4][1], [5][1]):\nRow 0: 🌏\nRow 1: 🐟\nRow 2: 🌏\nRow 3: ☁️\nRow 4: 🐔\nRow 5: 🐔\nEmojis: 🌏, 🐟, 🌏, ☁️, 🐔, 🐔\nCheck runs:\nRow 0: 🌏 (count 1)\nRow 1: 🐟 (diff, run 1 → no. count 1)\nRow 2: 🌏 (diff, run 1 → no. count 1)\nRow 3: ☁️ (diff, run 1 → no. count 1)\nRow 4: 🐔 (count 1)\nRow 5: 🐔 (count 2 → 2 >=2. So this is a run. So column 1 has 1 vertical line (rows 4-5: 🐔, length 2).\n\nColumn 2 (positions [0][2], [1][2], [2][2], [3][2], [4][2], [5][2]):\nRow 0: 🌏\nRow 1: 🐟\nRow 2: 🌏\nRow 3: 🐔\nRow 4: 🌏\nRow 5: 🐔\nEmojis: 🌏, 🐟, 🌏, 🐔, 🌏, 🐔\nCheck runs:\nEach emoji is different from the next.

So count 1. Then current 🐔, count 2)\nRow 2: 🌏 (diff, run 🐔 (length 2) counted. Current 🌏, count 1)\nRow 3: 🐔 (diff, run 1 → no. Current 🐔, count 1)\nRow 4: ☁️ (diff, run 1 → no. Current ☁️, count 1)\nRow 5: 🌏 (diff, run 1 → no. So column 3 has 1 vertical line (rows 0-1: 🐔, length 2).\n\nColumn 4 (positions [0][4], [1][4], [2][4], [3][4], [4][4], [5][4]):\nRow 0: 🐟\nRow 1: 🌏\nRow 2: ☁️\nRow 3: 🐔\nRow 4: 🐟\nRow 5: ☁️\nEmojis: 🐟, 🌏, ☁️, 🐔, 🐟, ☁️\nCheck runs:\nAll different from next. No runs of >=2. So column 4 contributes 0.\n\nColumn 5 (positions [0][5], [1][5], [2][5], [3][5], [4][5], [5][5]):\nRow 0: 🌏\nRow 1: ☁️\nRow 2: ☁️\nRow 3: 🌏\nRow 4: 🐟\nRow 5: 🐔\nEmojis: 🌏, ☁️, ☁️, 🌏, 🐟, 🐔\nCheck runs:\nRow 0: 🌏 (count 1)\nRow 1: ☁️ (diff, run 1 → no. count 1)\nRow 2: ☁️ (count 2 → 2 >=2 → run. So count 1. Current ☁️, count 2)\nRow 3: 🌏 (diff, run ☁️ (length 2) counted. Current 🌏, count 1)\nRow 4: 🐟 (diff, run 1 → no. Current 🐟, count 1)\nRow 5: 🐔 (diff, run 1 → no. So column 5 contributes 1 (rows 1-2: ☁️, length 2).\n\nSo vertical lines: column 0 (1) + column 1 (1) + column 2 (0) + column 3 (1) + column 4 (0) + column 5 (1) → total 4.\n\nWait, let me double-check each column.\n\nColumn 0: 🌏, 🐟, 🌏, 🌏, 🐔, 🐟. The 🌏 in rows 2 and 3 (indices 2 and 3) are consecutive. So that's a run of 2. So yes, 1.\n\nColumn 1: 🐔 in rows 4 and 5 (indices 4 and 5). That's 2, so 1.\n\nColumn 3: 🐔 in rows 0 and 1 (indices 0 and 1). 2, so 1.\n\nColumn 5: ☁️ in rows 1 and 2 (indices 1 and 2). 2, so 1.\n\nSo vertical lines sum to 4.\n\nSo total lines are horizontal (8) + vertical (4) = 12.\n\nWait, let me check the horizontal lines again. Let's recount the rows.\n\nRow 0: 🌏🌏🌏 → length 3 → 1. Correct.\n\nRow 1: 🐟🐟🐟 → 3 → 1. Correct.\n\nRow 2: 🌏🌏🌏🌏 (4) → 1. Then ☁️☁️ (2) → 1. Total 2. Correct.\n\nRow 3: 🐔🐔🐔 (3) → 1. Correct.\n\nRow 4: 🐔🐔 (2) → 1. Then 🐟🐟 (2) → 1. Total 2. Correct.\n\nRow 5: 🐔🐔 (rows 1-2 of row 5? Let's check row 5's elements. Row 5 is \"🐟🐔🐔🌏☁️🐔\". So elements are: 0:🐟, 1:🐔, 2:🐔, 3:🌏, 4:☁️, 5:🐔. So the run is positions 1-2: 🐔🐔 (length 2) → 1. Correct. So row 5 contributes 1.\n\nSo row counts: 1+1+2+1+2+1=8. Correct.\n\nVertical columns: 1+1+0+1+0+1=4. Correct.\n\nTotal 8+4=12.

For each such consecutive sequence of length L (where L >=2), the number of lines it contributes is (L-1). Because, for example, a sequence of 3 same emojis has 2 lines (positions 1-2 and 2-3). Oh right, wait, maybe I should think of it as the number of possible consecutive pairs. Like, a run of length 2 contributes 1 line, length 3 contributes 2, length 4 contributes 3, etc. Because each adjacent pair in the run is a line of length 2, and longer runs have overlapping lines.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each row in the board, scan left to right, find all consecutive runs of the same emoji. For each run of length L, add (L-1) to the total.\n2. Do the same for each column: scan top to bottom, find consecutive runs, add (L-1) for each run of L >=2.\n3. Sum all these contributions.\n\nLet's start by writing down the board. Let's list each row first. The board is 7 rows (since there are 7 lines given) and 7 columns (each row has 7 emojis).\n\nRow 0: 🦎🦎🐡😄🐡🌍😄 → indexes 0-6\nRow 1: 🦎🌍🤚🐡🌍🌍🤚 → indexes 0-6\nRow 2: 🌍🌍😄😄🌍🌍😄 → indexes 0-6\nRow 3: 🌍🐡🦄🤚😄🦄🤚 → indexes 0-6\nRow 4: 🤚🤚🦎🤚🦄🌍🤚 → indexes 0-6\nRow 5: 🦄🌍🐡🐡🤚🤚🦎 → indexes 0-6\nRow 6: 🤚🦎😄😄🦄😄🦄 → indexes 0-6\n\nLet's process rows first.\n\nProcessing Rows:\n\nRow 0: [🦎, 🦎, 🐡, 😄, 🐡, 🌍, 😄]\nCheck consecutive same:\n- Positions 0-1: 🦎, 🦎 → length 2 → contributes 1 (2-1)\n- Then 🐡 (pos2) is alone. 😄 (pos3) alone. 🐡 (pos4) alone. 🌍 (pos5) alone. 😄 (pos6) alone.

So column 3: 1.\n\nColumn 4: [🐡 (row0), 🌍 (row1), 🌍 (row2), 😄 (row3), 🦄 (row4), 🤚 (row5), 🦄 (row6)]\nCheck row1 and row2: 🌍, 🌍 → length 2 → 1. So column 4: 1.\n\nColumn 5: [🌍 (row0), 🌍 (row1), 🌍 (row2), 🦄 (row3), 🌍 (row4), 🤚 (row5), 😄 (row6)]\nCheck row0, row1, row2: 🌍, 🌍, 🌍 → length 3 → contributes 2 (3-1). Because 3 consecutive gives 2 lines (positions 0-1 and 1-2). So column 5 contributes 2.\n\nColumn 6: [😄 (row0), 🤚 (row1), 😄 (row2), 🤚 (row3), 🤚 (row4), 🦎 (row5), 🦄 (row6)]\nCheck row3 and row4: 🤚, 🤚 → length 2 → 1. So column 6 contributes 1.\n\nLet's verify column 5 again. Column 5 has:\n\nRow0: 🌍\nRow1: 🌍\nRow2: 🌍\nRow3: 🦄\nRow4: 🌍\nRow5: 🤚\nRow6: 😄\n\nSo rows 0,1,2 are 🌍. So the run is 3 in length. So 3-1=2. Correct.\n\nNow, let's sum the column contributions:\n\nColumn 0: 2\nColumn 1: 1\nColumn 2: 0\nColumn 3: 1\nColumn 4: 1\nColumn 5: 2\nColumn 6: 1\nTotal column contributions: 2+1+0+1+1+2+1 = 8.\n\nSo total lines are row contributions (9) + column contributions (8) = 17.\n\nWait, let's double-check each row and column.\n\nRows:\n\nRow 0: [🦎,🦎, ...] → 1. Correct.\n\nRow 1: [..., 🌍, 🌍, ...] → 1. Correct.\n\nRow 2: [🌍,🌍], [😄,😄], [🌍,🌍] → 3. Correct.\n\nRow 3: no runs. 0. Correct.\n\nRow 4: [🤚,🤚] → 1. Correct.\n\nRow 5: [🐡,🐡], [🤚,🤚] → 2. Correct.\n\nRow 6: [😄,😄] → 1. Correct. 1+1+3+0+1+2+1=9. Correct.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow0: 🦎\n\nRow1: 🦎 → run of 2 (0-1) → 1.\n\nRow2: 🌍\n\nRow3: 🌍 → run of 2 (2-3) → 1. So 2. Correct.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow1: 🌍\n\nRow2: 🌍 → run of 2 (1-2) → 1. Correct.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow3: 🤚\n\nRow4: 🤚 → run of 2 (3-4) → 1. Correct.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nRow1: 🌍\n\nRow2: 🌍 → run of 2 (1-2) → 1. Correct.\n\nColumn 5:\n\nRow0: 🌍\n\nRow1: 🌍\n\nRow2: 🌍 → run of 3 (0-1-2) → 2. Correct.\n\nColumn 6:\n\nRow3: 🤚\n\nRow4: 🤚 → run of 2 (3-4) → 1. Correct.\n\nColumns 2: all different. 0. Correct.\n\nSo columns sum to 2+1+0+1+1+2+1=8.\n\nTotal 9+8=17. So the answer should be 17.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more. A line of length \\( L \\) (where \\( L \\geq 2 \\)) contributes \\( L-1 \\) to the total count, as each adjacent pair in the line forms a valid segment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Horizontal Lines (Rows):** For each row, scan left to right to find consecutive runs of the same emoji. For each run of length \\( L \\), add \\( L-1 \\) to the total.\n2. **Vertical Lines (Columns):** For each column, scan top to bottom to find consecutive runs of the same emoji.

So, the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines of the same emoji with length 2 or more. Hmm. Let's break this down. \n\nFirst, I need to process each row for horizontal lines and each column for vertical lines. For each possible consecutive sequence in a row or column, if the length is at least 2, each such sequence contributes (length - 1) to the count. Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, let's think. For example, if there's a horizontal line of 3 same emojis, like A A A, how many lines of length >=2 are there here? Well, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". So a sequence of 3 same emojis in a row would have two overlapping lines of length 2 (positions 0-1, 1-2) and one line of length 3 (0-2). Wait, no. Or maybe the problem counts each maximal consecutive sequence as a single line, but only if the length is >=2. Oh, no, the question says \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So each consecutive run of the same emoji of length L >=2 contributes (L - 1) lines? Because for a run of L, the number of possible lines of length 2 is (L-1), length 3 is (L-2), etc. But wait, no. Let's clarify with examples.\n\nSuppose a row has \"A A A\". So the possible lines are:\n\n- Positions 0-1 (length 2)\n- Positions 1-2 (length 2)\n- Positions 0-1-2 (length 3)\n\nSo that's 3 lines. So a run of length L (L >=2) contributes (L*(L-1))\/2? Because 3 elements: 3 lines (2+1). 2 elements: 1 line. 4 elements: 4*(4-1)\/2=6? Let's check 4 elements: 0-1, 0-1-2, 0-1-2-3, 1-2, 1-2-3, 2-3. That's 6 lines. Oh right, 4 elements have 6 possible lines (length 2,3,4). So 2 elements: 1 (only length 2). 3 elements: 3 (2,2,3). 4 elements: 6 (2,2,2,3,3,4). So the formula for a run of length L is L*(L-1)\/2. Because 2: 2*1\/2=1. 3:3*2\/2=3. 4:4*3\/2=6. That matches. So that's the key. So for each consecutive run of the same emoji (horizontal or vertical) of length L >=2, we add L*(L-1)\/2 to the total count.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each row in the board, process each horizontal run.\n2. For each column in the board, process each vertical run.\n3. Sum all the contributions from these runs.\n\nLet's start by handling the rows (horizontal lines).\n\nThe board is given as 10 rows (since the input has 10 lines, each line is a row). Let's check:\n\nRow 0: 🎋🌲🦍🦍🐈🌲🌲🦐🌷🌲 (length 10)\nRow 1: 🐈🦍🌲🐈🌷🐈😃😃🌲🦍 (length 10)\nRow 2: 🌲🦐🌲🎋🌻🦐😃🎋🌷🌲 (length 10)\nRow 3: 🐈🌲🌻🐈🦐🦍😃🌷🌲🌲 (length 10)\nRow 4: 🦐😃😃🌻🌷😃🐈😃😃🐈 (length 10)\nRow 5: 😃🌻😃🌻😃🐈🌷🦍🎋🦐 (length 10)\nRow 6: 🐈🐈🎋🦐😃🌻🦍🦐🌻🌻 (length 10)\nRow 7: 🌻🦍🐈🎋🐈🌻🐈🎋🌷🌲 (length 10)\nRow 8: 🦍🌷🐈🦍🦍🌻🌻🌷🌲🎋 (length 10)\nRow 9: 🎋🐈🎋😃😃😃🌲🐈🐈🐈 (length 10)\n\nEach row has 10 elements.\n\nProcessing each row:\n\nLet's process row 0: 🎋, 🌲, 🦍, 🦍, 🐈, 🌲, 🌲, 🦐, 🌷, 🌲.\n\nCheck consecutive runs:\n\n- 🎋: length 1 (no contribution)\n- 🌲: length 1 (no)\n- 🦍: length 2 → 2*(2-1)\/2 = 1 → add 1\n- 🐈: length 1 (no)\n- 🌲: length 2 → 1 → add 1\n- 🦐: 1 (no)\n- 🌷: 1 (no)\n- 🌲: 1 (no)\nSo row 0 contributes 1+1=2.\n\nRow 1: 🐈, 🦍, 🌲, 🐈, 🌷, 🐈, 😃, 😃, 🌲, 🦍.\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🐈:1\n- 🦍:1\n- 🌲:1\n- 🐈:1\n- 🌷:1\n- 🐈:1\n- 😃:2 → 1 → add 1\n- 🌲:1\n- 🦍:1\nSo row 1 contributes 1.\n\nRow 2: 🌲, 🦐, 🌲, 🎋, 🌻, 🦐, 😃, 🎋, 🌷, 🌲.\n\nRuns:\n\nEach element is unique. So 0.\n\nRow 3: 🐈, 🌲, 🌻, 🐈, 🦐, 🦍, 😃, 🌷, 🌲, 🌲.\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🌲 at end: length 2 → 1 → add 1.\n\nRow 3 contributes 1.\n\nRow 4: 🦐, 😃, 😃, 🌻, 🌷, 😃, 🐈, 😃, 😃, 🐈.\n\nRuns:\n\n- 😃:2 (positions 1-2) → 1.\n- Then, after 🌻 (1), 🌷 (1), 😃 (1), 🐈 (1), then 😃:2 (positions 7-8) → 1. So 1+1=2.\n\nRow 4 contributes 2.\n\nRow 5: 😃, 🌻, 😃, 🌻, 😃, 🐈, 🌷, 🦍, 🎋, 🦐.\n\nEach element is unique. 0.\n\nRow 6: 🐈, 🐈, 🎋, 🦐, 😃, 🌻, 🦍, 🦐, 🌻, 🌻.\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🐈:2 → 1.\n- 🌻:2 → 1. So 1+1=2.\n\nRow 6 contributes 2.\n\nRow 7: 🌻, 🦍, 🐈, 🎋, 🐈, 🌻, 🐈, 🎋, 🌷, 🌲.\n\nEach element is unique. 0.\n\nRow 8: 🦍, 🌷, 🐈, 🦍, 🦍, 🌻, 🌻, 🌷, 🌲, 🎋.\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🦍:2 (positions 3-4) → 1.\n- 🌻:2 (positions 5-6) → 1. So 1+1=2.\n\nRow 8 contributes 2.\n\nRow 9: 🎋, 🐈, 🎋, 😃, 😃, 😃, 🌲, 🐈, 🐈, 🐈.\n\nRuns:\n\n- 😃:3 (positions 3-5) → 3*2\/2=3.\n- 🐈:3 (positions 7-9) → 3*2\/2=3. So 3+3=6.\n\nRow 9 contributes 6.\n\nNow sum all row contributions:\n\nRow 0:2; row1:1; row2:0; row3:1; row4:2; row5:0; row6:2; row7:0; row8:2; row9:6.\n\nRow total: 2+1+0+1+2+0+2+0+2+6 = 16.\n\nNow process columns (vertical lines). There are 10 columns (each of length 10). Let's index columns 0-9.\n\nEach column is 10 elements (since 10 rows). Let's process each column.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow 0: 🎋\nRow 1: 🐈\nRow 2: 🌲\nRow 3: 🐈\nRow 4: 🦐\nRow 5: 😃\nRow 6: 🐈\nRow 7: 🌻\nRow 8: 🦍\nRow 9: 🎋\n\nAll elements are unique. 0.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow 0: 🌲\nRow 1: 🦍\nRow 2: 🦐\nRow 3: 🌲\nRow 4: 😃\nRow 5: 🌻\nRow 6: 🐈\nRow 7: 🦍\nRow 8: 🌷\nRow 9: 🐈\n\nAll unique. 0.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow 0: 🦍\nRow 1: 🌲\nRow 2: 🌲\nRow 3: 🌻\nRow 4: 😃\nRow 5: 😃\nRow 6: 🎋\nRow 7: 🐈\nRow 8: 🐈\nRow 9: 🎋\n\nCheck runs:\n\nRow 0: 🦍 (1)\nRow 1: 🌲 (1)\nRow 2: 🌲 → 2 (rows 1-2). 2*(2-1)\/2=1.\nRow 3: 🌻 (1)\nRow 4: 😃 (1)\nRow 5: 😃 → 2 (rows 4-5). 1.\nRow 6: 🎋 (1)\nRow 7: 🐈 (1)\nRow 8: 🐈 → 2 (rows 7-8). 1.\nRow 9: 🎋 (1)\nSo 1+1+1=3.\n\nColumn 2 contributes 3.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow 0: 🦍\nRow 1: 🐈\nRow 2: 🎋\nRow 3: 🐈\nRow 4: 🌻\nRow 5: 🌻\nRow 6: 🦐\nRow 7: 🎋\nRow 8: 🦍\nRow 9: 😃\n\nCheck runs:\n\nRow 0: 🦍 (1)\nRow 1: 🐈 (1)\nRow 2: 🎋 (1)\nRow 3: 🐈 (1)\nRow 4: 🌻 (1)\nRow 5: 🌻 → 2 (rows 4-5). 1.\nRow 6: 🦐 (1)\nRow 7: 🎋 (1)\nRow 8: 🦍 (1)\nRow 9: 😃 (1)\nSo 1.\n\nColumn 3 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nRow 0: 🐈\nRow 1: 🌷\nRow 2: 🌻\nRow 3: 🦐\nRow 4: 🌷\nRow 5: 😃\nRow 6: 😃\nRow 7: 🐈\nRow 8: 🦍\nRow 9: 😃\n\nCheck runs:\n\nRow 0: 🐈 (1)\nRow 1: 🌷 (1)\nRow 2: 🌻 (1)\nRow 3: 🦐 (1)\nRow 4: 🌷 (1)\nRow 5: 😃 (1)\nRow 6: 😃 → 2 (rows 5-6). 1.\nRow 7: 🐈 (1)\nRow 8: 🦍 (1)\nRow 9: 😃 (1)\nSo 1.\n\nColumn 4 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 5:\n\nRow 0: 🌲\nRow 1: 🐈\nRow 2: 🦐\nRow 3: 🦍\nRow 4: 😃\nRow 5: 🐈\nRow 6: 🌻\nRow 7: 🌻\nRow 8: 🌻\nRow 9: 😃\n\nCheck runs:\n\nRow 0: 🌲 (1)\nRow 1: 🐈 (1)\nRow 2: 🦐 (1)\nRow 3: 🦍 (1)\nRow 4: 😃 (1)\nRow 5: 🐈 (1)\nRow 6: 🌻 (1)\nRow 7: 🌻 (row6-7: 2 → 1)\nRow 8: 🌻 (row7-8: 3 → 3*2\/2=3)\nRow 9: 😃 (1)\nSo the run here is 🌻 in rows 6-8: length 3. So 3*2\/2=3. So contributes 3.\n\nColumn 5 contributes 3.\n\nColumn 6:\n\nRow 0: 🌲\nRow 1: 😃\nRow 2: 😃\nRow 3: 😃\nRow 4: 🐈\nRow 5: 🌷\nRow 6: 🦍\nRow 7: 🐈\nRow 8: 🌻\nRow 9: 🌲\n\nCheck runs:\n\nRow 0: 🌲 (1)\nRow 1: 😃 (1)\nRow 2: 😃 → 2 (rows 1-2: 1)\nRow 3: 😃 → 3 (rows 1-3: 3*2\/2=3)\nRow 4: 🐈 (1)\nRow 5: 🌷 (1)\nRow 6: 🦍 (1)\nRow 7: 🐈 (1)\nRow 8: 🌻 (1)\nRow 9: 🌲 (1)\nSo the run is 😃 in rows 1-3: length 3. 3*2\/2=3. Contributes 3.\n\nColumn 6 contributes 3.\n\nColumn 7:\n\nRow 0: 🦐\nRow 1: 😃\nRow 2: 🎋\nRow 3: 🌷\nRow 4: 😃\nRow 5: 🦍\nRow 6: 🦐\nRow 7: 🎋\nRow 8: 🌷\nRow 9: 🐈\n\nCheck all elements: 🌷 (row3), 🌷 (row8). Are they consecutive? Let's list the elements:\n\nRow0: 🦐, row1: 😃, row2: 🎋, row3: 🌷, row4: 😃, row5: 🦍, row6: 🦐, row7: 🎋, row8: 🌷, row9: 🐈.\n\nSo 🌷 is in row3 and row8, not consecutive. All elements are unique except 🌷, but they are not consecutive. So 0.\n\nColumn 7 contributes 0.\n\nColumn 8:\n\nRow 0: 🌷\nRow 1: 🌲\nRow 2: 🌷\nRow 3: 🌲\nRow 4: 😃\nRow 5: 🎋\nRow 6: 🌻\nRow 7: 🌷\nRow 8: 🌲\nRow 9: 🐈\n\nCheck elements: 🌷 (row0), 🌷 (row2), 🌷 (row7) → all not consecutive. 🌲 in row1, row3, row8: not consecutive. All others are unique. 0.\n\nColumn 8 contributes 0.\n\nColumn 9:\n\nRow 0: 🌲\nRow 1: 🦍\nRow 2: 🌲\nRow 3: 🌲\nRow 4: 🐈\nRow 5: 🦐\nRow 6: 🌻\nRow 7: 🌲\nRow 8: 🎋\nRow 9: 🐈\n\nCheck runs:\n\nRow0: 🌲 (1)\nRow1: 🦍 (1)\nRow2: 🌲 (1)\nRow3: 🌲 → 2 (rows 2-3: 1)\nRow4: 🐈 (1)\nRow5: 🦐 (1)\nRow6: 🌻 (1)\nRow7: 🌲 (1)\nRow8: 🎋 (1)\nRow9: 🐈 (1)\nSo run of 🌲 in rows 2-3 (length 2). 1.\n\nColumn 9 contributes 1.\n\nNow sum column contributions:\n\nColumn 0:0; 1:0; 2:3; 3:1; 4:1; 5:3; 6:3; 7:0; 8:0; 9:1.\n\nSum: 0+0+3+1+1+3+3+0+0+1= 12.\n\nTotal lines are row contributions (16) + column contributions (12) = 28.\n\nWait, let's recheck the column calculations.\n\nLet me recheck column 2:\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow0: 🦍\nRow1: 🌲\nRow2: 🌲\nRow3: 🌻\nRow4: 😃\nRow5: 😃\nRow6: 🎋\nRow7: 🐈\nRow8: 🐈\nRow9: 🎋\n\nSo:\n\nRow1 is 🌲, row2 is 🌲 → run of 2 → 1.\n\nRow4: 😃, row5: 😃 → run of 2 → 1.\n\nRow7: 🐈, row8: 🐈 → run of 2 → 1. So 1+1+1=3. Correct.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow4: 🌻, row5: 🌻 → run of 2 → 1. Correct.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nRow5: 😃, row6: 😃 → 1. Correct.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow6: 🌻, row7: 🌻, row8: 🌻 → run of 3 → 3*2\/2=3. Correct.\n\nColumn6:\n\nRow1: 😃, row2: 😃, row3: 😃 → run of 3 → 3*2\/2=3. Correct.\n\nColumn9:\n\nRow2: 🌲, row3: 🌲 → run of 2 → 1. Correct.\n\nSum columns: 3+1+1+3+3+1= 12. Correct.\n\nRow contributions: 2+1+0+1+2+0+2+0+2+6= 16. Correct.\n\nTotal 16+12=28. So the answer is 28.\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, where each line has a length of 2 or more.

So the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines of the same emoji with length 2 or more. Hmm. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to process the board. The board is a 10x10 grid, right? Let's confirm. Each row has 10 emojis, and there are 10 rows. So rows are horizontal, columns are vertical.\n\nFor horizontal lines: For each row, check consecutive emojis. For example, if a row has \"A A A B B\", then the horizontal lines are \"A A A\" (length 3) and \"B B\" (length 2). But how do we count these? Because a longer line (like 3) can have multiple overlapping lines of length 2. Wait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". Oh wait, maybe I need to count each maximal consecutive sequence of the same emoji, and then for each such sequence of length L, the number of lines is (L-1). Because for example, a sequence of length 2 contributes 1 line (the two elements), a sequence of length 3 contributes 2 lines (positions 1-2 and 2-3), etc. Or wait, maybe the problem counts each possible consecutive pair. Let's read the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So a line is a consecutive sequence of the same emoji of length ≥2. So for a horizontal line of length L (≥2), how many lines does it contribute? Let's see. For example, a sequence of 3 same emojis (like A A A) in a row. Then there's a line of length 3. But does that count as 1 line (the entire 3-length) or 2 lines (the first two and the last two)? The problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". So I think each maximal consecutive run contributes 1 line if it's length 2, 1 line if length 3, etc. Wait, no. Because a run of length 3 has two possible 2-length lines (positions 0-1 and 1-2), but also a 3-length line (0-2). So does the problem count all possible consecutive sequences of length ≥2, regardless of overlapping?\n\nWait, the problem statement example: suppose the user gives an example. Let's think of a simple case. Suppose a row is \"A A A\". How many horizontal lines are there here? Let's say:\n\n- Positions 0-1: length 2 → count 1.\n- Positions 1-2: length 2 → count 1.\n- Positions 0-2: length 3 → count 1.\nSo total 3? Or does the problem count each maximal run as 1 line, regardless of length? The problem statement isn't clear. Let's re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So a \"line\" here is a consecutive sequence (horizontal or vertical) of the same emoji, of length 2 or more. Each such sequence is counted once, regardless of length. For example, \"A A A\" in a row would have a single horizontal line of length 3. But that's not correct. Because the problem could be interpreted as all possible consecutive sequences (overlapping) of length ≥2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a \"line\" is a maximal consecutive sequence. For example, \"A A A B B\" would have two lines: one of length 3 (A's) and one of length 2 (B's). But that would count each maximal run of same emoji (length ≥2) as 1. But the problem statement isn't explicit. Let's check the example given by the user. The user's example input is a 10x10 grid, and the expected output is a number. Let's think of a small test case to clarify.\n\nSuppose a 2x2 grid:\n\nRow 0: A A\nRow 1: A A\n\nHorizontal lines: Each row has a horizontal line of length 2. So 2 horizontal lines.\n\nVertical lines: Each column has a vertical line of length 2. So 2 vertical lines.\n\nTotal 4.\n\nAnother test case: 1x3 row: A A A. Horizontal lines: 1 (the entire 3-length) or 2 (since 0-1 and 1-2 are 2-length lines, and 0-2 is 3-length). If the problem counts all possible consecutive sequences of length ≥2, then 0-1 (2), 1-2 (2), 0-2 (3) → 3 lines. But that's probably not the case, because that would make the count very high.\n\nAlternatively, the problem counts each maximal consecutive run (same emoji) of length ≥2 as one line. For example, a run of 3 A's would be 1 line (since it's a single maximal run). Then, in the 1x3 example, 1 line.\n\nBut how to know? Let's think of the problem statement's example. The user's example has a 10x10 grid, and the answer is to be given. Let's think of the correct approach.\n\nThe problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". A line is a consecutive sequence (horizontal or vertical) of the same emoji, of length 2 or longer. Each such sequence is counted once. For example, in a horizontal row like \"A A A\", there's one horizontal line (the three A's). In a row like \"A A B B B\", there are two horizontal lines (the two A's and the three B's). Similarly for vertical lines.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because a line is a consecutive group. So each group (maximal consecutive same emoji) of length ≥2 contributes 1 to the count.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\nFor each row (horizontal):\n\n- Iterate through each row, and for each row, find all consecutive runs of the same emoji. For each run, if the length is ≥2, add 1 to the count.\n\nFor each column (vertical):\n\n- Iterate through each column, and for each column, find all consecutive runs of the same emoji. For each run, if the length is ≥2, add 1 to the count.\n\nYes, that's the correct approach.\n\nSo, let's proceed with that.\n\nNow, let's process the given board.\n\nFirst, let's list the board rows. The board is:\n\nRow 0: 🌍🐓🌘🌘🦏🐧🐌🌘🐫🐧\nRow 1: 🌍🐫🐓🐫🐧🐧🐓🐌🐧🌲\nRow 2: 🌲🦏🌘🌲🐧🦓🐫🌘🐧🐌\nRow 3: 🌍🌘🐌🌍🐌🌍🦓🐌🌍🌘\nRow 4: 🐓🌲🐧🐓🐓🐧🐌🌍🦏🌲\nRow 5: 🦏🐓🐧🐧🐧🐫🦏🦏🐌🐌\nRow 6: 🐫🐌🌲🦏🐌🌍🌍🐌🌍🦓\nRow 7: 🦏🦓🌍🐓🦏🦏🌲🦓🌍🐧\nRow 8: 🐫🌘🦓🌘🐫🐓🦏🐫🌲🐓\nRow 9: 🌍🐧🦏🐌🐌🌍🐫🌘🌲🦏\n\nLet's process each row (horizontal first):\n\nRow 0: 🌍, 🐓, 🌘, 🌘, 🦏, 🐧, 🐌, 🌘, 🐫, 🐧\n\nLooking for consecutive runs of same emojis:\n\n- 🌍 (length 1) → no\n- 🐓 (1) → no\n- 🌘 (2) → yes → count 1\n- 🦏 (1) → no\n- 🐧 (1) → no\n- 🐌 (1) → no\n- 🌘 (1) → no\n- 🐫 (1) → no\n- 🐧 (1) → no\nSo row 0 horizontal contributes 1.\n\nRow 1: 🌍, 🐫, 🐓, 🐫, 🐧, 🐧, 🐓, 🐌, 🐧, 🌲\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🌍 (1)\n- 🐫 (1)\n- 🐓 (1)\n- 🐫 (1)\n- 🐧 (2) → count 1\n- 🐓 (1)\n- 🐌 (1)\n- 🐧 (1)\n- 🌲 (1)\nSo row 1 horizontal contributes 1.\n\nRow 2: 🌲, 🦏, 🌘, 🌲, 🐧, 🦓, 🐫, 🌘, 🐧, 🐌\n\nAll single → 0.\n\nRow 3: 🌍, 🌘, 🐌, 🌍, 🐌, 🌍, 🦓, 🐌, 🌍, 🌘\n\nAll single → 0.\n\nRow 4: 🐓, 🌲, 🐧, 🐓, 🐓, 🐧, 🐌, 🌍, 🦏, 🌲\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🐓 (1)\n- 🌲 (1)\n- 🐧 (1)\n- 🐓 (2) → count 1\n- 🐧 (1)\n- 🐌 (1)\n- 🌍 (1)\n- 🦏 (1)\n- 🌲 (1)\nSo row 4 contributes 1.\n\nRow 5: 🦏, 🐓, 🐧, 🐧, 🐧, 🐫, 🦏, 🦏, 🐌, 🐌\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🦏 (1)\n- 🐓 (1)\n- 🐧 (3) → count 1\n- 🐫 (1)\n- 🦏 (2) → count 1\n- 🐌 (2) → count 1\nTotal 3.\n\nRow 6: 🐫, 🐌, 🌲, 🦏, 🐌, 🌍, 🌍, 🐌, 🌍, 🦓\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🐫 (1)\n- 🐌 (1)\n- 🌲 (1)\n- 🦏 (1)\n- 🐌 (1)\n- 🌍 (2) → count 1\n- 🐌 (1)\n- 🌍 (1)\n- 🦓 (1)\nSo 1.\n\nRow 7: 🦏, 🦓, 🌍, 🐓, 🦏, 🦏, 🌲, 🦓, 🌍, 🐧\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🦏 (1)\n- 🦓 (1)\n- 🌍 (1)\n- 🐓 (1)\n- 🦏 (2) → count 1\n- 🌲 (1)\n- 🦓 (1)\n- 🌍 (1)\n- 🐧 (1)\nSo 1.\n\nRow 8: 🐫, 🌘, 🦓, 🌘, 🐫, 🐓, 🦏, 🐫, 🌲, 🐓\n\nAll single → 0.\n\nRow 9: 🌍, 🐧, 🦏, 🐌, 🐌, 🌍, 🐫, 🌘, 🌲, 🦏\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🌍 (1)\n- 🐧 (1)\n- 🦏 (1)\n- 🐌 (2) → count 1\n- 🌍 (1)\n- 🐫 (1)\n- 🌘 (1)\n- 🌲 (1)\n- 🦏 (1)\nSo 1.\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 1 (row0) +1 (row1) +0 (row2) +0 (row3) +1 (row4) +3 (row5) +1 (row6) +1 (row7) +0 (row8) +1 (row9) → 1+1=2, +1=3, +3=6, +1=7, +1=8, +1=9. So 9 horizontal lines.\n\nNow vertical lines. Need to check each column (10 columns, 10 rows each) for consecutive runs.\n\nLet's list the columns. Each column is 10 elements (rows 0-9).\n\nColumn 0 (index 0):\n\nRow 0: 🌍\n\nRow 1: 🌍\n\nRow 2: 🌲\n\nRow 3: 🌍\n\nRow 4: 🐓\n\nRow 5: 🦏\n\nRow 6: 🐫\n\nRow 7: 🦏\n\nRow 8: 🐫\n\nRow 9: 🌍\n\nSo column 0 elements: 🌍, 🌍, 🌲, 🌍, 🐓, 🦏, 🐫, 🦏, 🐫, 🌍.\n\nCheck consecutive runs:\n\nRow 0-1: 🌍, 🌍 → run of 2 → count 1.\n\nRow 1-2: 🌍 vs 🌲 → break.\n\nRow 2-3: 🌲 vs 🌍 → break.\n\nRow 3-4: 🌍 vs 🐓 → break.\n\nRow 4-5: 🐓 vs 🦏 → break.\n\nRow 5-6: 🦏 vs 🐫 → break.\n\nRow 6-7: 🐫 vs 🦏 → break.\n\nRow 7-8: 🦏 vs 🐫 → break.\n\nRow 8-9: 🐫 vs 🌍 → break.\n\nSo column 0 has 1 vertical line (the first two 🌍).\n\nColumn 1 (index 1):\n\nRow 0: 🐓\n\nRow 1: 🐫\n\nRow 2: 🦏\n\nRow 3: 🌘\n\nRow 4: 🌲\n\nRow 5: 🐓\n\nRow 6: 🐌\n\nRow 7: 🦓\n\nRow 8: 🌘\n\nRow 9: 🐧\n\nAll elements are distinct in consecutive positions.

So 7.\n\nTotal 9 +7=16.\n\nWait, but let's recheck column 8:\n\nColumn 8 (index 8):\n\nRow 0: 🐫\n\nRow 1: 🐧\n\nRow 2: 🐧 → run of 2 → 1.\n\nRow 3: 🌍\n\nRow 4: 🦏\n\nRow 5: 🐌\n\nRow 6: 🌍\n\nRow 7: 🌍 → run of 2 → 1.\n\nRow 8: 🌲\n\nRow 9: 🌲 → run of 2 → 1.\n\nYes, 3 runs. So 3. So 3.\n\nSo 1 (col0) + 1 (col2) + 1 (col4) +1 (col5) +3 (col8) = 7. Correct.\n\nSo total 9 +7=16.\n\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more on a 10x10 rectangular board.

The task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines of the same emoji with length 2 or more. Hmm, so first I need to check each row for horizontal sequences and each column for vertical sequences.\n\nLet me start by writing down the board. Let's index rows from 0 to 5 (since there are 6 rows) and columns from 0 to 5 (6 columns each). The board given is:\n\nRow 0: 🐣🐏🐏🐣🐏🎋\nRow 1: 🐏🎋🐣🎋🐜🎋\nRow 2: 🐡🐣🐣🐣🐣🐣\nRow 3: 🎋🐡🐡🐣🐏🐣\nRow 4: 🎋🎋🐜🎋🐏🐣\nRow 5: 🐏🐡🎋🐡🐡🐡\n\nFirst, let's handle horizontal lines. For each row, we need to look for consecutive same emojis. For a sequence of length L (where L >=2), how many lines does it contribute? For example, a sequence of length 2 contributes 1 line. A sequence of length 3 contributes 2 lines (positions 0-1 and 1-2). Wait, wait. Wait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So a line is a consecutive sequence of 2 or more. So a sequence of length n (n >=2) contributes (n-1) lines? Or is each maximal consecutive sequence of length m considered as 1 line? Oh, the problem statement says \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines\". So I need to clarify: for example, if there's a horizontal sequence of 3 same emojis, like \"A A A\", how many lines are there? The lines would be the first two (positions 0-1), the next two (1-2), and the entire three (0-2) if length 3 is considered. Wait, no. Let's read the problem again. \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So a line is a consecutive run of the same emoji with length at least 2. So each such consecutive run (maximal) of length L contributes 1 line if L >=2. Because a \"line\" here is a contiguous segment. For example, \"A A A\" is a single horizontal line of length 3. But wait, maybe the problem counts every possible consecutive pair. Like, \"A A A\" would have two overlapping lines of length 2 (positions 0-1 and 1-2) and one line of length 3 (0-2). But the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So perhaps each maximal sequence of length L (>=2) contributes (L-1) lines. Because a line of length 2 is 1, length 3 is 2 (since 3-1=2), etc. Because each line is a consecutive sequence of exactly 2, 3, etc. So for example, a sequence of 4 same emojis: positions 0-1 (length 2), 0-2 (length 3), 0-3 (length 4), 1-2 (length 2), 1-3 (length 3), 2-3 (length 2). That's 6 lines. But that's 4-1 choose 2 plus something? No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's check the problem statement again. The problem says \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So each line is a consecutive sequence (horizontal or vertical) of 2 or more same emojis. So for example, if there's a horizontal run of 3 same emojis, that's 1 line of length 3. If there's a run of 2, that's 1 line of length 2. So the count is the number of such runs (maximal) where the length is >=2.\n\nWait, but maybe not. Let's think of an example. Suppose a row is \"A A A\". Then the possible lines are:\n\n- positions 0-1 (length 2)\n\n- positions 1-2 (length 2)\n\n- positions 0-2 (length 3)\n\nSo that's 3 lines. So the problem's answer depends on whether overlapping sequences are counted. But the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So each possible consecutive segment of 2 or more same emojis counts as a line. So in \"A A A\", there are 3 lines: (0-1), (1-2), (0-2). Similarly, a run of 4 would have (0-1), (1-2), (2-3), (0-2), (1-3), (0-3) → 6 lines. Because for a run of length L, the number of possible lines is (L*(L-1))\/2. Because the number of possible consecutive sequences of length ≥2 is sum_{k=2 to L} (L -k +1) ). Which is (L-1) + (L-2) + ... + 1) = L*(L-1)\/2 - 0 (since sum from 1 to L-1 is (L-1)*L\/2). So sum from k=2 to L of (L -k +1) = sum_{m=1 to L-1} m (where m = L -k +1, when k=2, m=L-1; k=L, m=1) → sum is (L-1)*L\/2. Wait, no. Let's compute for L=2: sum from k=2 to 2 → 1 term, (2-2+1)=1. So 1 line. For L=3: k=2 → 3-2+1=2 lines (positions 0-1, 1-2), k=3 → 3-3+1=1 line (0-2). So 2+1=3. Which is (3*2)\/2=3. For L=4: k=2 → 4-2+1=3 (0-1,1-2,2-3), k=3 → 4-3+1=2 (0-2,1-3), k=4 → 4-4+1=1 (0-3). Sum 3+2+1=6 = (4*3)\/2=6. So yes, the formula is (L*(L-1))\/2. Because sum from 2 to L of (L -k +1) ) = sum_{m=1 to L-1} m → which is (L-1)*L\/2. Oh right, because m = L -k +1. When k=2, m = L-1. When k=L, m=1. So sum m from 1 to L-1 is (L-1)*L\/2. So that's the number of lines for a run of length L.\n\nSo, for each horizontal and vertical run of the same emoji, if the length is L >=2, we add (L*(L-1))\/2 to the total.\n\nSo, for example, a horizontal run of 2 same emojis contributes 1 line. A run of 3 contributes 3 lines, run of 4 contributes 6, etc.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each row, check horizontal runs. For each run, calculate L. If L >=2, add (L*(L-1))\/2 to the total.\n\n2. For each column, check vertical runs. For each run, calculate L. If L >=2, add (L*(L-1))\/2 to the total.\n\nSo let's process the board row by row first.\n\nFirst, list of rows (each row as a list of emojis):\n\nRow 0: [🐣, 🐏, 🐏, 🐣, 🐏, 🎋]\n\nRow 1: [🐏, 🎋, 🐣, 🎋, 🐜, 🎋]\n\nRow 2: [🐡, 🐣, 🐣, 🐣, 🐣, 🐣]\n\nRow 3: [🎋, 🐡, 🐡, 🐣, 🐏, 🐣]\n\nRow 4: [🎋, 🎋, 🐜, 🎋, 🐏, 🐣]\n\nRow 5: [🐏, 🐡, 🎋, 🐡, 🐡, 🐡]\n\nLet's process each row for horizontal runs.\n\nRow 0:\n\nEmojis: 🐣, 🐏, 🐏, 🐣, 🐏, 🎋\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- 🐣 (length 1) → no.\n\n- 🐏 (length 2) → L=2. Contribution: (2*1)\/2=1.\n\n- 🐣 (length 1) → no.\n\n- 🐏 (length 1) → no.\n\n- 🎋 (length 1) → no.\n\nSo row 0 horizontal contributes 1.\n\nRow 1:\n\nEmojis: 🐏, 🎋, 🐣, 🎋, 🐜, 🎋\n\nAll are single. So no runs of 2. Contribution 0.\n\nRow 2:\n\nEmojis: 🐡, 🐣, 🐣, 🐣, 🐣, 🐣\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- 🐡 (length 1) → no.\n\n- 🐣: from index 1 to 5 (columns 1-5). Length L=5. Contribution (5*4)\/2=10.\n\nSo row 2 horizontal contributes 10.\n\nRow 3:\n\nEmojis: 🎋, 🐡, 🐡, 🐣, 🐏, 🐣\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🎋 (1) → no.\n\n- 🐡 (columns 1-2): L=2 → 1.\n\nOthers are single. So row 3 horizontal contributes 1.\n\nRow 4:\n\nEmojis: 🎋, 🎋, 🐜, 🎋, 🐏, 🐣\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🎋 (columns 0-1): L=2 → 1.\n\nOthers are single. So row 4 horizontal contributes 1.\n\nRow 5:\n\nEmojis: 🐏, 🐡, 🎋, 🐡, 🐡, 🐡\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🐏 (1) → no.\n\n- 🐡 (columns 3-5): L=3. Contribution (3*2)\/2=3.\n\nSo row 5 horizontal contributes 3.\n\nSo total horizontal contributions: 1 + 0 +10 +1 +1 +3 = 16.\n\nNow vertical lines. Let's process each column (0 to 5) and check vertical runs.\n\nEach column has 6 emojis (rows 0-5). Let's list each column:\n\nColumn 0 (rows 0-5):\n\nRow 0: 🐣\n\nRow 1: 🐏\n\nRow 2: 🐡\n\nRow 3: 🎋\n\nRow 4: 🎋\n\nRow 5: 🐏\n\nSo column 0 emojis: [🐣, 🐏, 🐡, 🎋, 🎋, 🐏]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- 🐣 (1) → no.\n\n- 🐏 (1) → no.\n\n- 🐡 (1) → no.\n\n- 🎋 (rows 3-4): L=2 → 1.\n\n- 🐏 (1) → no.\n\nSo column 0 vertical contributes 1.\n\nColumn 1 (rows 0-5):\n\nRow 0: 🐏\n\nRow 1: 🎋\n\nRow 2: 🐣\n\nRow 3: 🐡\n\nRow 4: 🎋\n\nRow 5: 🐡\n\nEmojis: [🐏, 🎋, 🐣, 🐡, 🎋, 🐡]\n\nAll single. Contribution 0.\n\nColumn 2 (rows 0-5):\n\nRow 0: 🐏\n\nRow 1: 🐣\n\nRow 2: 🐣\n\nRow 3: 🐡\n\nRow 4: 🐜\n\nRow 5: 🎋\n\nEmojis: [🐏, 🐣, 🐣, 🐡, 🐜, 🎋]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- 🐏 (1) → no.\n\n- 🐣 (rows 1-2): L=2 → 1.\n\nOthers single. So column 2 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 3 (rows 0-5):\n\nRow 0: 🐣\n\nRow 1: 🎋\n\nRow 2: 🐣\n\nRow 3: 🐣\n\nRow 4: 🎋\n\nRow 5: 🐡\n\nEmojis: [🐣, 🎋, 🐣, 🐣, 🎋, 🐡]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- 🐣 (row 0: 1) → no.\n\n- 🎋 (row 1: 1) → no.\n\n- 🐣 (rows 2-3: L=2) → 1.\n\nOthers single. So column 3 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 4 (rows 0-5):\n\nRow 0: 🐏\n\nRow 1: 🐜\n\nRow 2: 🐣\n\nRow 3: 🐏\n\nRow 4: 🐏\n\nRow 5: 🐡\n\nEmojis: [🐏, 🐜, 🐣, 🐏, 🐏, 🐡]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- 🐏 (row 0: 1) → no.\n\n- 🐜 (row 1: 1) → no.\n\n- 🐣 (row 2: 1) → no.\n\n- 🐏 (rows 3-4: L=2) → 1.\n\nOthers single. So column 4 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 5 (rows 0-5):\n\nRow 0: 🎋\n\nRow 1: 🎋\n\nRow 2: 🐣\n\nRow 3: 🐣\n\nRow 4: 🐣\n\nRow 5: 🐡\n\nEmojis: [🎋, 🎋, 🐣, 🐣, 🐣, 🐡]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- 🎋 (rows 0-1: L=2) → 1.\n\n- 🐣 (rows 2-4: L=3). Contribution (3*2)\/2=3.\n\nSo column 5 vertical contributes 1 +3=4.\n\nLet's verify column 5:\n\nRow 0: 🎋\n\nRow 1: 🎋 → same as row 0. So that's a run of 2. Contribution 1.\n\nThen row 2: 🐣, row3: 🐣, row4: 🐣. So rows 2-4: 3 🐣s. L=3. Contribution 3. So 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nSo column 5 contributes 4.\n\nNow sum all vertical contributions:\n\nColumn 0:1\n\nColumn1:0\n\nColumn2:1\n\nColumn3:1\n\nColumn4:1\n\nColumn5:4\n\nTotal vertical: 1+0+1+1+1+4=8.\n\nTotal lines: horizontal (16) + vertical (8) =24.\n\nWait, let's recheck the vertical columns.\n\nLet me recheck column 5:\n\nRow 0: 🎋, row 1: 🎋 → run of 2 (🎋). Contribution (2*1)\/2=1.\n\nThen row 2: 🐣, row3: 🐣, row4: 🐣 → run of 3 (🐣). Contribution (3*2)\/2=3. So 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow 3: 🎋, row4: 🎋 → run of 2. Contribution 1. Correct.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow 1: 🐣, row2: 🐣 → run of 2. Contribution 1. Correct.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow 2: 🐣, row3: 🐣 → run of 2. Contribution 1. Correct.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nRow3: 🐏, row4: 🐏 → run of 2. Contribution 1. Correct.\n\nSo vertical sum 1+0+1+1+1+4=8.\n\nHorizontal sum 16.\n\nTotal 24.\n\nLet me check each row's horizontal contributions again.\n\nRow 0:\n\nOriginal row: 🐣, 🐏, 🐏, 🐣, 🐏, 🎋.\n\nThe runs are:\n\n- 🐣 (1), 🐏 (2), 🐣 (1), 🐏 (1), 🎋 (1). So only the 🐏 run of 2. Contribution 1. Correct.\n\nRow 1: all single. 0. Correct.\n\nRow 2: 🐡 (1), then 🐣 (5). 5 in a row. (5*4)\/2=10. Correct.\n\nRow3: 🎋 (1), 🐡 (2), then others single. 1. Correct.\n\nRow4: 🎋 (2), others single. 1. Correct.\n\nRow5: 🐏 (1), 🐡 (1), 🎋 (1), then 🐡 (3). (3*2)\/2=3. Correct. So 1+0+10+1+1+3=16. Correct.\n\nYes, 16+8=24. So the answer should be 24.\n\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more. A line is defined as a consecutive sequence of the same emoji with a length of at least 2.

So, I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines where the same emoji appears in a row or column, with length 2 or more. Each such consecutive sequence counts as a line. Wait, but how exactly? Like, if there's a run of 3 same emojis, does that count as 2 lines (since 3-1=2) or as one line? Let me think. The problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". Oh right, so a line is a consecutive sequence of the same emoji with length >=2. So for a horizontal line, if a row has \"A A A\", that's a single line of length 3. But wait, maybe the problem counts each possible consecutive pair? Like, for \"A A A\", there are two overlapping pairs (positions 1-2 and 2-3), but maybe each such pair is considered a line. Wait, no. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe problem says \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So a line here is a consecutive sequence of the same emoji of length 2 or longer. So for example, in a horizontal row, if there's a sequence of 3 same emojis, that's one line. Because it's a single line of length 3. But maybe if there are two separate sequences, like \"A A B B B\", that's two lines: one of length 2 (A's) and one of length 3 (B's). So the approach is: for each row and column, scan and find all consecutive runs of the same emoji with length >=2. Each such run contributes 1 to the total count.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for each row, we check each possible horizontal run, and for each column, each vertical run. Then sum all of them.\n\nLet's start with the given board. Let's first write down the board rows as lists for clarity.\n\nThe board is given as:\n\nRow 0: 🐤 🎁 🌍 🌍 🐤\nRow 1: 🌍 🐤 🎁 🐤 🌍\nRow 2: 🎁 🌍 🌍 🌍 🌍\nRow 3: 🎁 🌍 🌍 🎁 🐤\nRow 4: 🐤 🎁 🎁 🎁 🎁\n\nSo rows are 5 rows, each 5 columns (indices 0-4). Let's process each row first for horizontal lines.\n\nProcessing horizontal lines (rows):\n\nRow 0: [🐤, 🎁, 🌍, 🌍, 🐤]\nCheck consecutive runs:\n- 🐤 (length 1)\n- 🎁 (length 1)\n- 🌍, 🌍 (length 2) → count 1\n- 🐤 (length 1)\nTotal for row 0: 1.\n\nRow 1: [🌍, 🐤, 🎁, 🐤, 🌍]\nEach emoji is single. So 0.\n\nRow 2: [🎁, 🌍, 🌍, 🌍, 🌍]\nCheck runs:\n- 🎁 (1)\n- 🌍, 🌍, 🌍, 🌍 (length 4) → count 1.\nTotal row 2: 1.\n\nRow 3: [🎁, 🌍, 🌍, 🎁, 🐤]\nRuns:\n- 🎁 (1)\n- 🌍, 🌍 (length 2) → count 1\n- 🎁 (1)\n- 🐤 (1)\nTotal row 3: 1.\n\nRow 4: [🐤, 🎁, 🎁, 🎁, 🎁]\nRuns:\n- 🐤 (1)\n- 🎁, 🎁, 🎁, 🎁 (length 4) → count 1\nTotal row 4: 1.\n\nSo horizontal lines sum: 1 + 0 +1 +1 +1 = 4.\n\nNow vertical lines (columns).

Let's list each column's elements.\n\nColumn 0 (each row's 0th element):\nRow 0: 🐤\nRow 1: 🌍\nRow 2: 🎁\nRow 3: 🎁\nRow 4: 🐤\nSo column 0: [🐤, 🌍, 🎁, 🎁, 🐤]\nCheck runs:\n- 🐤 (1)\n- 🌍 (1)\n- 🎁, 🎁 (length 2) → count 1\n- 🐤 (1)\nTotal column 0: 1.\n\nColumn 1 (each row's 1st element):\nRow 0: 🎁\nRow 1: 🐤\nRow 2: 🌍\nRow 3: 🌍\nRow 4: 🎁\nColumn 1: [🎁, 🐤, 🌍, 🌍, 🎁]\nRuns:\n- 🎁 (1)\n- 🐤 (1)\n- 🌍, 🌍 (length 2) → count 1\n- 🎁 (1)\nTotal column 1: 1.\n\nColumn 2 (each row's 2nd element):\nRow 0: 🌍\nRow 1: 🎁\nRow 2: 🌍\nRow 3: 🌍\nRow 4: 🎁\nColumn 2: [🌍, 🎁, 🌍, 🌍, 🎁]\nCheck runs:\n- 🌍 (1)\n- 🎁 (1)\n- 🌍, 🌍 (length 2) → count 1\n- 🎁 (1)\nTotal column 2: 1.\n\nColumn 3 (each row's 3rd element):\nRow 0: 🌍\nRow 1: 🐤\nRow 2: 🌍\nRow 3: 🎁\nRow 4: 🎁\nColumn 3: [🌍, 🐤, 🌍, 🎁, 🎁]\nRuns:\n- 🌍 (1)\n- 🐤 (1)\n- 🌍 (1)\n- 🎁, 🎁 (length 2) → count 1\nTotal column 3: 1.\n\nColumn 4 (each row's 4th element):\nRow 0: 🐤\nRow 1: 🌍\nRow 2: 🌍\nRow 3: 🐤\nRow 4: 🎁\nColumn 4: [🐤, 🌍, 🌍, 🐤, 🎁]\nRuns:\n- 🐤 (1)\n- 🌍, 🌍 (length 2) → count 1\n- 🐤 (1)\n- 🎁 (1)\nTotal column 4: 1.\n\nSo vertical lines sum: 1+1+1+1+1 =5.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check column 2 again. Let's list column 2's elements again:\n\nRow 0: 🌍 (index 0)\nRow 1: 🎁 (index 1)\nRow 2: 🌍 (index 2)\nRow 3: 🌍 (index 3)\nRow 4: 🎁 (index 4)\n\nSo the column 2 is [🌍, 🎁, 🌍, 🌍, 🎁]. Let's look for consecutive same emojis:\n\nCheck from index 0: 🌍 (only one, next is 🎁 → no run)\nIndex 1: 🎁, next is 🌍 → no run.\nIndex 2: 🌍, next (index 3) is 🌍 → run starts at 2, length 2 (indices 2 and 3). Then index 4 is 🎁. So that's a run of 2 → count 1. So column 2's vertical lines: 1. Correct.\n\nWhat about column 2's row 2 and 3: 🌍, 🌍. Yes, that's a run of 2. So column 2 contributes 1.\n\nAnother check: column 4:\n\nRow 0: 🐤 (index 0)\nRow 1: 🌍 (index 1)\nRow 2: 🌍 (index 2) → so 🌍 at 1 and 2: consecutive. So 🌍, 🌍 (indices 1 and 2) → run length 2. So that's 1. Correct.\n\nNow, let's check row 2 again. Row 2 is [🎁, 🌍, 🌍, 🌍, 🌍]. The 🌍s start at index 1 and go to 4 (indices 1,2,3,4). So that's a run of 4. So that's one horizontal line. Correct.\n\nRow 4 is [🐤, 🎁, 🎁, 🎁, 🎁]. The 🎁s are from index 1 to 4. That's 4 in a row. So 1 horizontal line. Correct.\n\nRow 3: [🎁, 🌍, 🌍, 🎁, 🐤]. The 🌍s are at indices 1 and 2 → run of 2. So 1 horizontal line. Correct.\n\nRow 0: [🐤, 🎁, 🌍, 🌍, 🐤]. The 🌍s are indices 2 and 3 → run of 2. 1 horizontal line. Correct.\n\nSo horizontal total is 4. Vertical total is 5. So 4 +5=9?\n\nWait, but let's make sure I didn't miss any runs.\n\nLet's recheck each row and column.\n\nHorizontal lines (rows):\n\nRow 0: [🐤, 🎁, 🌍, 🌍, 🐤] → 1 run (🌍,🌍). Correct.\n\nRow 1: [🌍, 🐤, 🎁, 🐤, 🌍] → all single. Correct.\n\nRow 2: [🎁, 🌍, 🌍, 🌍, 🌍] → 1 run (🌍 x4). Correct.\n\nRow 3: [🎁, 🌍, 🌍, 🎁, 🐤] → 1 run (🌍 x2). Correct.\n\nRow 4: [🐤, 🎁, 🎁, 🎁, 🎁] → 1 run (🎁 x4). Correct. Total 4.\n\nVertical lines (columns):\n\nColumn 0: [🐤, 🌍, 🎁, 🎁, 🐤] → run of 🎁 at indices 2 and 3 (length 2). 1.\n\nColumn 1: [🎁, 🐤, 🌍, 🌍, 🎁] → 🌍 at indices 2 and 3 (length 2). 1.\n\nColumn 2: [🌍, 🎁, 🌍, 🌍, 🎁] → 🌍 at indices 2 and 3 (length 2). 1.\n\nColumn 3: [🌍, 🐤, 🌍, 🎁, 🎁] → 🎁 at indices 3 and 4 (length 2). 1.\n\nColumn 4: [🐤, 🌍, 🌍, 🐤, 🎁] → 🌍 at indices 1 and 2 (length 2). 1.\n\nEach column has exactly one run of 2. So 5. 4+5=9.\n\nIs there any other run that I missed?\n\nLet me check row 2 again. The 🌍s in row 2 are 4 in a row. So that's one line. Correct.\n\nRow 4's 🎁s are 4 in a row: 1 line. Correct.\n\nWhat about vertical runs longer than 2?\n\nLet's check column 2 again. The 🌍s in column 2 are at indices 2 and 3. So 2 in a row. Correct.\n\nWhat about column 2, rows 2,3: 🌍, 🌍. Correct.\n\nAnother check: column 2. The elements are:\n\nRow 0: 🌍\nRow 1: 🎁\nRow 2: 🌍\nRow 3: 🌍\nRow 4: 🎁\n\nSo the runs here are 🌍 (row 0) → no. Then 🎁 (row 1) → no. Then 🌍 (row 2) and 🌍 (row 3) → run of 2. Then 🎁 (row 4) → no. So 1 run. Correct.\n\nWhat about column 2, if there were 3 🌍s in a row, like 🌍, 🌍, 🌍 → that's 1 run. But in our case, column 2's 🌍s are 2. So 1.\n\nAnother example: column 2 in row 2 and 3: 🌍, 🌍 → 2. So 1 run.\n\nSo yes, 5 vertical runs. 4 horizontal. 9 total.\n\nSo the answer is 9.\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, where each line has a length of 2 or more.

So, the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, where each line has a length of 2 or more. Hmm. Let's break this down. \n\nFirst, I need to check all possible horizontal lines (rows) and vertical lines (columns) in the board. For each row, I look for consecutive same emojis of length 2 or more. Similarly, for each column, do the same. But wait, how do I count overlapping lines? Like, if there's a sequence of 3 same emojis, that's two overlapping lines of length 2 (positions 1-2 and 2-3), right? Or does the problem consider a single line of length 3 as contributing 1 to the count, or 2? Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" Oh, right. So a line is a consecutive sequence of the same emoji. For example, in a row like [A, A, A], there's a horizontal line of length 3. So how many lines does that count as? Let's see. If the line is of length L (>=2), then the number of possible consecutive sequences of length 2 or more in it is (L-1) + (L-2) + ... + 1? No, wait. Wait, no. Because a line is a maximal consecutive sequence. Or maybe the problem counts each possible consecutive run of same emojis of length >=2 as a single line, regardless of length. Let's clarify.\n\nWait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So, for example, in a row like [A, A, A], that's a single horizontal line of length 3, which is >=2, so it counts as 1. But if the row is [A, A, B, B, B], then there are two lines: the A's (length 2) and the B's (length 3), each contributing 1. So each maximal consecutive run of same emojis with length >=2 counts as 1 line.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to check. Let's take a sample. Suppose a row is [X, X]. Then that's a line of length 2: count 1. If a row is [X, X, X], that's a line of length 3: count 1. Because it's a single continuous line. So each such run (maximal consecutive same emojis) of length >=2 counts as 1.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So a line is a contiguous segment of the same emoji, length >=2. So each such segment is a line, and we count each once.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each row, split into consecutive runs of the same emoji. For each run, if its length is >=2, increment the count by 1.\n\n2. For each column, do the same: split into consecutive runs of the same emoji. For each run with length >=2, increment the count by 1.\n\nThen sum all these to get the total.\n\nLet's confirm with a small example. Suppose a 2x2 grid:\n\nRow 0: A A\n\nRow 1: A A\n\nThen, horizontal lines: each row has a run of 2, so 2 lines. Vertical lines: each column (each column has two A's) has a run of 2, so 2 lines. Total 4.\n\nAnother example: 1x3 row: A A A. Horizontal lines: 1. Vertical lines: none (since it's a single row). So total 1.\n\nAnother example: 3x1 column: A, A, A. Vertical lines: 1. Horizontal lines: 0. Total 1.\n\nAnother example: 3x3 grid:\n\nRow 0: A A B\n\nRow 1: A A B\n\nRow 2: C C C\n\nHorizontal lines:\n\nRow 0: A (2), B (1) → 1.\n\nRow 1: A (2), B (1) → 1.\n\nRow 2: C (3) → 1. So 3.\n\nVertical lines:\n\nColumn 0: A (2), C (1) → 1.\n\nColumn 1: A (2), C (1) → 1.\n\nColumn 2: B (2), C (1) → 1. So 3.\n\nTotal 6.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each row in the board, process each row to find consecutive runs. For each run of length >=2, add 1 to the count.\n\n- For each column in the board, process each column to find consecutive runs. For each run of length >=2, add 1 to the count.\n\nSo, let's process the given board.\n\nFirst, let's write down the board as rows. The board is:\n\nRow 0: 🐋🐗🐎🐎🐗🐗 → [🐋, 🐗, 🐎, 🐎, 🐗, 🐗]\n\nRow 1: 🐋🐸🐎🌙🐎🐎 → [🐋, 🐸, 🐎, 🌙, 🐎, 🐎]\n\nRow 2: 🐋🐋🐸🐸🐸🐎 → [🐋, 🐋, 🐸, 🐸, 🐸, 🐎]\n\nRow 3: 🐗🌙🐎🐎🐗🐋 → [🐗, 🌙, 🐎, 🐎, 🐗, 🐋]\n\nRow 4: 🌙🐋🐗🐋🐗🐗 → [🌙, 🐋, 🐗, 🐋, 🐗, 🐗]\n\nRow 5: 🐋🐸🐸🐸🐸🐋 → [🐋, 🐸, 🐸, 🐸, 🐸, 🐋]\n\nSo there are 6 rows, each with 6 elements. So 6 rows, 6 columns.\n\nFirst, process horizontal lines (rows):\n\nRow 0: [🐋, 🐗, 🐎, 🐎, 🐗, 🐗]\n\nCheck consecutive runs:\n\n- 🐋: length 1 → no.\n\n- 🐗: length 1 → no.\n\n- 🐎: length 2 → yes. So +1.\n\n- 🐗: length 2 → yes. So +1.\n\nSo row 0 contributes 2.\n\nRow 1: [🐋, 🐸, 🐎, 🌙, 🐎, 🐎]\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🐋: 1 → no.\n\n- 🐸: 1 → no.\n\n- 🐎: 1 → no.\n\n- 🌙: 1 → no.\n\n- 🐎: 2 → yes. So +1.\n\nRow 1 contributes 1.\n\nRow 2: [🐋, 🐋, 🐸, 🐸, 🐸, 🐎]\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🐋: 2 → yes. +1.\n\n- 🐸: 3 → yes. +1.\n\n- 🐎: 1 → no.\n\nRow 2 contributes 2.\n\nRow 3: [🐗, 🌙, 🐎, 🐎, 🐗, 🐋]\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🐗: 1 → no.\n\n- 🌙: 1 → no.\n\n- 🐎: 2 → yes. +1.\n\n- 🐗: 1 → no.\n\n- 🐋: 1 → no.\n\nRow 3 contributes 1.\n\nRow 4: [🌙, 🐋, 🐗, 🐋, 🐗, 🐗]\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🌙: 1 → no.\n\n- 🐋: 1 → no.\n\n- 🐗: 1 → no.\n\n- 🐋: 1 → no.\n\n- 🐗: 2 → yes. +1.\n\nRow 4 contributes 1.\n\nRow 5: [🐋, 🐸, 🐸, 🐸, 🐸, 🐋]\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🐋: 1 → no.\n\n- 🐸: 4 → yes. +1.\n\n- 🐋: 1 → no.\n\nRow 5 contributes 1.\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8.\n\nNow, process vertical lines (columns). There are 6 columns (each column has 6 elements, since 6 rows).\n\nLet's list each column:\n\nColumn 0 (rows 0-5):\n\nRow 0: 🐋\n\nRow 1: 🐋\n\nRow 2: 🐋\n\nRow 3: 🐗\n\nRow 4: 🌙\n\nRow 5: 🐋\n\nSo column 0: [🐋, 🐋, 🐋, 🐗, 🌙, 🐋]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- 🐋: 3 (rows 0-2) → yes. +1.\n\n- 🐗: 1 → no.\n\n- 🌙: 1 → no.\n\n- 🐋: 1 → no.\n\nSo column 0 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 1 (rows 0-5):\n\nRow 0: 🐗\n\nRow 1: 🐸\n\nRow 2: 🐋\n\nRow 3: 🌙\n\nRow 4: 🐋\n\nRow 5: 🐸\n\nColumn 1: [🐗, 🐸, 🐋, 🌙, 🐋, 🐸]\n\nAll elements are different from their neighbors. So runs of 1. No lines. Contributes 0.\n\nColumn 2 (rows 0-5):\n\nRow 0: 🐎\n\nRow 1: 🐎\n\nRow 2: 🐸\n\nRow 3: 🐎\n\nRow 4: 🐗\n\nRow 5: 🐸\n\nColumn 2: [🐎, 🐎, 🐸, 🐎, 🐗, 🐸]\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🐎: 2 (rows 0-1) → yes. +1.\n\nOthers are length 1. So column 2 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 3 (rows 0-5):\n\nRow 0: 🐎\n\nRow 1: 🌙\n\nRow 2: 🐸\n\nRow 3: 🐎\n\nRow 4: 🐋\n\nRow 5: 🐸\n\nColumn 3: [🐎, 🌙, 🐸, 🐎, 🐋, 🐸]\n\nAll runs are 1. Contributes 0.\n\nColumn 4 (rows 0-5):\n\nRow 0: 🐗\n\nRow 1: 🐎\n\nRow 2: 🐸\n\nRow 3: 🐗\n\nRow 4: 🐗\n\nRow 5: 🐸\n\nColumn 4: [🐗, 🐎, 🐸, 🐗, 🐗, 🐸]\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🐗: 2 (rows 3-4) → yes. +1.\n\nOthers are 1. So column 4 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 5 (rows 0-5):\n\nRow 0: 🐗\n\nRow 1: 🐎\n\nRow 2: 🐎\n\nRow 3: 🐋\n\nRow 4: 🐗\n\nRow 5: 🐋\n\nColumn 5: [🐗, 🐎, 🐎, 🐋, 🐗, 🐋]\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🐎: 2 (rows 1-2) → yes. +1.\n\nOthers are 1. So column 5 contributes 1.\n\nNow, let's list all columns:\n\nColumn 0: 1\n\nColumn 1: 0\n\nColumn 2: 1\n\nColumn 3: 0\n\nColumn 4: 1\n\nColumn 5: 1\n\nTotal vertical lines: 1+0+1+0+1+1 = 4.\n\nWait, wait, let's double-check column 5. Column 5 elements are:\n\nRow 0: 🐗 (from original row 0: \"🐋🐗🐎🐎🐗🐗\" → 6th element (index 5) is 🐗)\n\nRow 1: \"🐋🐸🐎🌙🐎🐎\" → 6th element (index 5) is 🐎.\n\nRow 2: \"🐋🐋🐸🐸🐸🐎\" → index 5 is 🐎.\n\nRow 3: \"🐗🌙🐎🐎🐗🐋\" → index 5 is 🐋.\n\nRow 4: \"🌙🐋🐗🐋🐗🐗\" → index 5 is 🐗.\n\nRow 5: \"🐋🐸🐸🐸🐸🐋\" → index 5 is 🐋.\n\nSo column 5 elements: [🐗, 🐎, 🐎, 🐋, 🐗, 🐋].\n\nYes. The run of 🐎 is in rows 1 and 2 (indices 1 and 2 of the column). So length 2. So that's a vertical line. So column 5 contributes 1. Correct.\n\nNow, column 0: [🐋, 🐋, 🐋, 🐗, 🌙, 🐋]. The first three elements are 🐋. So run length 3 → yes. So 1.\n\nColumn 2: [🐎, 🐎, 🐸, 🐎, 🐗, 🐸]. The first two are 🐎, run length 2 → yes. So 1.\n\nColumn 4: [🐗, 🐎, 🐸, 🐗, 🐗, 🐸]. The elements at row 3 and 4 (indices 3 and 4 of column 4) are 🐗, so run length 2 → yes. So 1.\n\nSo vertical lines total 1+0+1+0+1+1=4.\n\nSo total lines: horizontal (8) + vertical (4) = 12.\n\nWait, let's recount horizontal lines:\n\nRow 0: 2 (🐎🐎, 🐗🐗) → yes.\n\nRow 1: 1 (🐎🐎) → yes.\n\nRow 2: 2 (🐋🐋, 🐸🐸🐸) → yes.\n\nRow 3: 1 (🐎🐎) → yes.\n\nRow 4: 1 (🐗🐗) → yes.\n\nRow 5: 1 (🐸🐸🐸🐸) → yes.\n\nAdding these: 2+1=3; +2=5; +1=6; +1=7; +1=8. Correct. 8 horizontal.\n\nVertical lines 4. 8+4=12. So the answer should be 12.\n\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal and vertical lines formed by the same emoji, where each line has a length of 2 or more. A line is defined as a contiguous segment of the same emoji with a length of at least 2.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Horizontal Lines**: For each row, identify contiguous segments (runs) of the same emoji. Each run with a length of 2 or more contributes 1 to the count.\n2. **Vertical Lines**: For each column, similarly identify contiguous segments of the same emoji.

The task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines of the same emoji with length 2 or more. So, I need to check each row for horizontal sequences and each column for vertical sequences. Let's start by understanding the problem again.\n\nFirst, let's look at the board. The board is given as a list of strings, each string represents a row. Let's list out the rows first. Let's index them from 0 to 5 (since there are 6 rows), and each row has 6 elements (columns 0-5).\n\nThe rows are:\n\nRow 0: 🥀🦕🌳🦕🦕🌳\nRow 1: 🐛🐛🦍🦕🥀🐛\nRow 2: 🌳🌳🌳🐛🥀🥀\nRow 3: 🦕🥀🐛🦍🦕🥀\nRow 4: 🐛🦍🐛🌳🐛🐛\nRow 5: 🐛🥀🌳🦕🦍🥀\n\nNow, horizontal lines: For each row, we need to check consecutive same emojis of length 2 or more. Each such consecutive run contributes (length -1) lines. Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let's clarify. For example, a run of 3 same emojis (like 🌳🌳🌳) has how many lines? Because a line of length 2 is two in a row, and a line of length 3 can have two overlapping lines (positions 0-1, 1-2). But wait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So each such consecutive sequence of length k (k >=2) contributes (k -1) lines? Or maybe each consecutive run of length m (m >=2) counts as 1 line? Wait, the problem says \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines\". Let's think with examples.\n\nSuppose a horizontal line in a row is 🌳🌳. That's one line of length 2. If it's 🌳🌳🌳, that's a line of length 3. So does that count as 1 line (since it's a single line of length 3) or 2 lines (since 0-1 and 1-2 are two lines of length 2)?\n\nThe problem statement says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So a line is a consecutive sequence of same emojis of length >=2. So a run of 3 same emojis is one line (length 3), which is longer than 2, so it's counted once. Similarly, a run of 4 same emojis is one line (length 4). So for horizontal lines, each consecutive run (maximal) of same emojis with length >=2 counts as 1. Because the entire run is a single line. For example, 🌳🌳🌳 is a single horizontal line of length 3.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because a line is a consecutive sequence. So for example, in a row like [A, A, A], the horizontal lines are one line of length 3. So for each row, we need to find all consecutive runs of the same emoji where the length is at least 2, and count each such run as 1.\n\nSame for vertical lines. For each column, check consecutive runs (same emoji in consecutive rows) of length >=2, and count each such run as 1.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each row, process the row to find consecutive runs of same emojis, each of length >=2. Count each such run as 1.\n\n2. For each column, process the column to find consecutive runs of same emojis, each of length >=2. Count each such run as 1.\n\nSum these counts to get the total.\n\nLet's start with horizontal lines.\n\nProcessing each row:\n\nRow 0: 🥀🦕🌳🦕🦕🌳\n\nLet's list the elements as a list: [🥀, 🦕, 🌳, 🦕, 🦕, 🌳]\n\nCheck consecutive runs:\n\n- 🥀: length 1 (no)\n- 🦕: length 1 (no)\n- 🌳: length 1 (no)\n- 🦕, 🦕: length 2 (yes) → count 1\n- 🌳: length 1 (no)\nSo row 0 contributes 1.\n\nRow 1: 🐛🐛🦍🦕🥀🐛\n\nElements: [🐛, 🐛, 🦍, 🦕, 🥀, 🐛]\n\nConsecutive runs:\n\n- 🐛, 🐛: length 2 (yes) → count 1\n- 🦍: 1 (no)\n- 🦕: 1 (no)\n- 🥀: 1 (no)\n- 🐛: 1 (no)\nRow 1 contributes 1.\n\nRow 2: 🌳🌳🌳🐛🥀🥀\n\nElements: [🌳, 🌳, 🌳, 🐛, 🥀, 🥀]\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🌳, 🌳, 🌳: length 3 (yes) → count 1\n- 🐛: 1 (no)\n- 🥀, 🥀: length 2 (yes) → count 1\nRow 2 contributes 2.\n\nRow 3: 🦕🥀🐛🦍🦕🥀\n\nElements: [🦕, 🥀, 🐛, 🦍, 🦕, 🥀]\n\nAll are single elements. No runs of 2 or more. So 0.\n\nRow 4: 🐛🦍🐛🌳🐛🐛\n\nElements: [🐛, 🦍, 🐛, 🌳, 🐛, 🐛]\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🐛: 1 (no)\n- 🦍: 1 (no)\n- 🐛: 1 (no)\n- 🌳: 1 (no)\n- 🐛, 🐛: length 2 (yes) → count 1\nRow 4 contributes 1.\n\nRow 5: 🐛🥀🌳🦕🦍🥀\n\nElements: [🐛, 🥀, 🌳, 🦕, 🦍, 🥀]\n\nAll single. 0.\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 1 (row0) + 1 (row1) + 2 (row2) + 0 (row3) +1 (row4) +0 (row5) = 5.\n\nNow vertical lines. Need to process each column (0-5) and check consecutive runs in the column (rows 0-5).\n\nLet's list each column as a list of elements (row 0 to row 5):\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow 0: 🥀\n\nRow 1: 🐛\n\nRow 2: 🌳\n\nRow 3: 🦕\n\nRow 4: 🐛\n\nRow 5: 🐛\n\nSo column 0: [🥀, 🐛, 🌳, 🦕, 🐛, 🐛]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nLooking for consecutive same emojis. Let's check each position:\n\nrow 0: 🥀 → next (row1) is 🐛 → no.\n\nrow1: 🐛 → row2 is 🌳 → no.\n\nrow2: 🌳 → row3: 🦕 → no.\n\nrow3: 🦕 → row4: 🐛 → no.\n\nrow4: 🐛 → row5: 🐛 → same. So from row4 to row5: length 2. So this is a run of length 2. Count 1.\n\nSo column 0 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow 0: 🦕\n\nRow1: 🐛\n\nRow2: 🌳\n\nRow3: 🥀\n\nRow4: 🦍\n\nRow5: 🥀\n\nColumn1 elements: [🦕, 🐛, 🌳, 🥀, 🦍, 🥀]\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\nAll elements are different. So 0.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow0: 🌳\n\nRow1: 🦍\n\nRow2: 🌳\n\nRow3: 🐛\n\nRow4: 🐛\n\nRow5: 🌳\n\nColumn2 elements: [🌳, 🦍, 🌳, 🐛, 🐛, 🌳]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nrow0: 🌳 → row1: 🦍 → no.\n\nrow1: 🦍 → row2: 🌳 → no.\n\nrow2: 🌳 → row3: 🐛 → no.\n\nrow3: 🐛 → row4: 🐛 → same. So row3 and row4: length 2. Count 1.\n\nrow4: 🐛 → row5: 🌳 → no.\n\nSo column 2 contributes 1.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🦕\n\nRow1: 🦕\n\nRow2: 🐛\n\nRow3: 🦍\n\nRow4: 🌳\n\nRow5: 🦕\n\nColumn3 elements: [🦕, 🦕, 🐛, 🦍, 🌳, 🦕]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nrow0: 🦕 → row1: 🦕 → same. So length 2. Count 1.\n\nrow1: 🦕 → row2: 🐛 → no.\n\nOthers: no. So column3 contributes 1.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow0: 🦕\n\nRow1: 🥀\n\nRow2: 🥀\n\nRow3: 🦕\n\nRow4: 🐛\n\nRow5: 🦍\n\nColumn4 elements: [🦕, 🥀, 🥀, 🦕, 🐛, 🦍]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nrow0: 🦕 → row1: 🥀 → no.\n\nrow1: 🥀 → row2: 🥀 → same. Length 2. Count 1.\n\nrow2: 🥀 → row3: 🦕 → no.\n\nOthers: no. So column4 contributes 1.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow0: 🌳\n\nRow1: 🐛\n\nRow2: 🥀\n\nRow3: 🥀\n\nRow4: 🐛\n\nRow5: 🥀\n\nColumn5 elements: [🌳, 🐛, 🥀, 🥀, 🐛, 🥀]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nrow0: 🌳 → row1: 🐛 → no.\n\nrow1: 🐛 → row2: 🥀 → no.\n\nrow2: 🥀 → row3: 🥀 → same. Length 2. Count 1.\n\nrow3: 🥀 → row4: 🐛 → no.\n\nrow4: 🐛 → row5: 🥀 → no.\n\nSo column5 contributes 1.\n\nLet's list all columns:\n\nColumn 0: 1\n\nColumn 1: 0\n\nColumn 2: 1\n\nColumn 3: 1\n\nColumn 4: 1\n\nColumn 5: 1\n\nTotal vertical lines: 1+0+1+1+1+1=5.\n\nSo total lines: horizontal (5) + vertical (5) = 10?\n\nWait, let's recheck. Let me recount the vertical columns.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nElements: [🥀, 🐛, 🌳, 🦕, 🐛, 🐛]\n\nLooking for consecutive same. The last two are 🐛, 🐛. So a run of 2. So 1. Correct.\n\nColumn 1:\n\n[🦕, 🐛, 🌳, 🥀, 🦍, 🥀]. All different. 0. Correct.\n\nColumn 2:\n\n[🌳, 🦍, 🌳, 🐛, 🐛, 🌳]. The 3rd and 4th elements (rows 3 and 4) are 🐛, 🐛. So run of 2. 1. Correct.\n\nColumn 3:\n\n[🦕, 🦕, 🐛, 🦍, 🌳, 🦕]. First two are 🦕, 🦕. Run of 2. 1. Correct.\n\nColumn4:\n\n[🦕, 🥀, 🥀, 🦕, 🐛, 🦍]. Rows 1 and 2 are 🥀, 🥀. Run of 2. 1. Correct.\n\nColumn5:\n\n[🌳, 🐛, 🥀, 🥀, 🐛, 🥀]. Rows 2 and 3 are 🥀, 🥀. Run of 2. 1. Correct. So 1+0+1+1+1+1=5. Correct.\n\nHorizontal lines:\n\nRow 0: [🥀, 🦕, 🌳, 🦕, 🦕, 🌳]. The 3rd and 4th elements (index 3 and 4) are 🦕, 🦕. So run of 2. 1. Correct.\n\nRow 1: [🐛, 🐛, ...]. First two are 🐛, 🐛. Run of 2. 1. Correct.\n\nRow 2: [🌳, 🌳, 🌳, ...]. Run of 3 (indices 0-2). 1. Then [🥀, 🥀] (indices 4-5). 1. So 2. Correct.\n\nRow 3: All single. 0. Correct.\n\nRow4: [🐛, 🦍, 🐛, 🌳, 🐛, 🐛]. Last two (indices 4-5) are 🐛, 🐛. Run of 2. 1. Correct.\n\nRow5: All single. 0. So 1+1+2+0+1+0=5. Correct.\n\nTotal 5 +5=10. So the answer should be 10.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more on a given rectangular board. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Horizontal Lines**: For each row, identify consecutive runs of the same emoji where the length of the run is at least 2. Each such run is counted as one horizontal line.\n2. **Vertical Lines**: For each column, identify consecutive runs of the same emoji where the length of the run is at least 2. Each such run is counted as one vertical line.\n\n### Solution Code\nWe first process each row to count horizontal lines and then each column to count vertical lines.\n\n#### Horizontal Lines Calculation\n- **Row 0**: `🥀🦕🌳🦕🦕🌳` has one run of `🦕` (length 2). Count: 1.\n- **Row 1**: `🐛🐛🦍🦕🥀🐛` has one run of `🐛` (length 2). Count: 1.\n- **Row 2**: `🌳🌳🌳🐛🥀🥀` has two runs: `🌳` (length 3) and `🥀` (length 2). Count: 2.\n- **Row 3**: `🦕🥀🐛🦍🦕🥀` has no runs of length ≥ 2. Count: 0.\n- **Row 4**: `🐛🦍🐛🌳🐛🐛` has one run of `🐛` (length 2). Count: 1.\n- **Row 5**: `🐛🥀🌳🦕🦍🥀` has no runs of length ≥ 2. Count: 0.\n\nTotal horizontal lines: \\(1 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 5\\).\n\n#### Vertical Lines Calculation\n- **Column 0**: `🥀🐛🌳🦕🐛🐛` has one run of `🐛` (length 2). Count: 1.\n- **Column 1**: `🦕🐛🌳🥀🦍🥀` has no runs of length ≥ 2. Count: 0.\n- **Column 2**: `🌳🦍🌳🐛🐛🌳` has one run of `🐛` (length 2). Count: 1.\n- **Column 3**: `🦕🦕🐛🦍🌳🦕` has one run of `🦕` (length 2). Count: 1.\n- **Column 4**: `🦕🥀🥀🦕🐛🦍` has one run of `🥀` (length 2). Count: 1.\n- **Column 5**: `🌳🐛🥀🥀🐛🥀` has one run of `🥀` (length 2). Count: 1.\n\nTotal vertical lines: \\(1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5\\).\n\n### Total Lines\nAdding the horizontal and vertical lines gives the final count: \\(5 + 5 = 10\\).\n\nAnswer: 10"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines of the same emoji with length 2 or more. Hmm. So first, I need to check each row for horizontal sequences and each column for vertical sequences. For each sequence, if it's length 2 or longer, I need to count how many such lines there are. Wait, but wait—what's considered a line here? Like, for a horizontal line of length k (k >=2), how many lines does it contribute? Oh right, because a line of length 2 is one line. A line of length 3 would have two possible lines (positions 1-2 and 2-3, but wait, maybe the problem counts the entire consecutive sequence as one line. Wait, the problem statement says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So a consecutive run of m same emojis (m >=2) in a row or column counts as (m -1) lines? Or is it one line per run?\n\nWait, the example. Let's think. Suppose a row is [A, A, A]. Then the horizontal lines would be: positions 0-1 (A,A), 1-2 (A,A), and 0-1-2 (A,A,A). But wait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So the length here refers to the number of consecutive same emojis. So a run of m same emojis (m >=2) would form (m - 1) lines of length 2, (m-2) lines of length 3, etc. Wait, no. Maybe the problem counts each maximal consecutive sequence as contributing (m - 1) lines. Because for example, if a row has \"AA\", that's a line of length 2. If it's \"AAA\", that's a line of length 3, which includes two lines of length 2 (the first two A's and the last two A's) and one line of length 3. But the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So each possible consecutive segment of length >=2 counts as a line. So for a run of length m, the number of such lines is m*(m-1)\/2 - (m-1)(m-2)\/2? Wait, no. Let's think again. For a run of length m, the number of possible consecutive sub-sequences of length 2 or more is (m-1) + (m-2) + ... + 1 = m*(m-1)\/2. Because for length 2, there are m-1 positions (starting at 0, 1, ..., m-2). For length 3, m-2 positions, etc. So for m=2: 1 line (length 2). For m=3: 2 (length 2) + 1 (length 3) = 3. For m=4: 3+2+1=6. So each run of m same emojis (m >=2) contributes m*(m-1)\/2 lines.\n\nWait, but let's check the problem statement. The problem says \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So each consecutive segment of same emojis with length >=2 counts as a line. So, for example, \"AA\" is 1 line (length 2). \"AAA\" is 1 line of length 3 (but does that count as a line, since 3 is >=2). Wait, but the problem might consider that a line of length 3 is a single line, not multiple. So perhaps, the problem counts each maximal consecutive run of same emojis (length >=2) as 1 line. For example, \"AA\" is 1 line, \"AAA\" is 1 line, \"AAAA\" is 1 line. Because the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So a line is a consecutive sequence of same emojis, and its length is 2 or more. So a run of 3 same emojis is one line of length 3, which counts as 1. A run of 2 is 1. So the total lines would be the number of such runs (horizontal and vertical) where the run's length is >=2.\n\nWait, but that's ambiguous. Let's read the problem statement again. The user says, \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So each horizontal line is a consecutive sequence of same emojis in a row, length >=2. Each vertical line is a consecutive sequence in a column, same emoji, length >=2. So, for example, a row like [A, A, B, B, B] has two horizontal lines: one of length 2 (AA) and one of length 3 (BBB). So that's 2. Similarly, a column with [A, A, A] has one vertical line of length 3. So each run (maximal consecutive sequence) of same emojis in a row or column, with length >=2, counts as 1.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because otherwise, if you have a run of 3, the count would be 2 (for two overlapping pairs), but the problem probably counts it as one line. Let's proceed with that assumption.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each row in the board, check all consecutive runs of the same emoji. For each run with length >=2, increment the count by 1.\n\n2. For each column in the board, check all consecutive runs of the same emoji. For each run with length >=2, increment the count by 1.\n\nNow, let's process the given board.\n\nFirst, let's write down the board as rows. Let's index rows from 0 to 5 (since there are 6 rows), and columns 0 to 5 (6 columns).\n\nThe board is:\n\nRow 0: 🐠🦉🏄🦉🐠🏄 → [0:🐠, 1:🦉, 2:🏄, 3:🦉, 4:🐠, 5:🏄]\n\nRow 1: 🦉🏄🎋🐠🎋⛅️ → [0:🦉, 1:🏄, 2:🎋, 3:🐠, 4:🎋, 5:⛅️]\n\nRow 2: 🦉🎋🦉🎋🏄🏄 → [0:🦉, 1:🎋, 2:🦉, 3:🎋, 4:🏄, 5:🏄]\n\nRow 3: ⛅️🐠🐠🦉🎋🎋 → [0:⛅️, 1:🐠, 2:🐠, 3:🦉, 4:🎋, 5:🎋]\n\nRow 4: 🎋🦉🏄🎋🏄🏄 → [0:🎋, 1:🦉, 2:🏄, 3:🎋, 4:🏄, 5:🏄]\n\nRow 5: 🐠⛅️🏄🎋🐠🏄 → [0:🐠, 1:⛅️, 2:🏄, 3:🎋, 4:🐠, 5:🏄]\n\nNow, check horizontal lines (each row):\n\nRow 0:\n\nCheck consecutive same emojis.\n\n0: 🐠, 1:🦉 → different.\n\n1:🦉, 2:🏄 → different.\n\n2:🏄, 3:🦉 → different.\n\n3:🦉, 4:🐠 → different.\n\n4:🐠, 5:🏄 → different. So no runs of length >=2. So 0.\n\nRow 1:\n\nCheck:\n\n0:🦉, 1:🏄 → different.\n\n1:🏄, 2:🎋 → different.\n\n2:🎋, 3:🐠 → different.\n\n3:🐠, 4:🎋 → different.\n\n4:🎋, 5:⛅️ → different. No runs. 0.\n\nRow 2:\n\nCheck:\n\n0:🦉, 1:🎋 → different.\n\n1:🎋, 2:🦉 → different.\n\n2:🦉, 3:🎋 → different.\n\n3:🎋, 4:🏄 → different.\n\n4:🏄, 5:🏄 → same. So run from 4-5 (length 2). So 1.\n\nRow 3:\n\nCheck:\n\n0:⛅️, 1:🐠 → different.\n\n1:🐠, 2:🐠 → same. Run 1-2 (length 2). Then 2:🐠, 3:🦉 → different.\n\n3:🦉, 4:🎋 → different.\n\n4:🎋, 5:🎋 → same. Run 4-5 (length 2). So 2.\n\nRow 4:\n\nCheck:\n\n0:🎋, 1:🦉 → different.\n\n1:🦉, 2:🏄 → different.\n\n2:🏄, 3:🎋 → different.\n\n3:🎋, 4:🏄 → different.\n\n4:🏄, 5:🏄 → same. Run 4-5 (length 2).

No runs. 0.\n\nSo horizontal lines: 0 (row 0) + 0 (row1) + 1 (row2) + 2 (row3) + 1 (row4) + 0 (row5) = 4.\n\nNow check vertical lines (each column):\n\nColumns 0 to 5.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRows 0-5: [🐠, 🦉, 🦉, ⛅️, 🎋, 🐠]\n\nCheck consecutive runs:\n\nRow0: 🐠, row1:🦉 → different.\n\nRow1:🦉, row2:🦉 → same. Run 1-2 (length 2). Then row2:🦉, row3:⛅️ → different.\n\nRow3:⛅️, row4:🎋 → different.\n\nRow4:🎋, row5:🐠 → different. So 1 run (length 2).\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRows 0-5: [🦉, 🏄, 🎋, 🐠, 🦉, ⛅️]\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\nAll different. 0.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRows 0-5: [🏄, 🏄, 🦉, 🐠, 🏄, 🏄]\n\nRow0:🏄, row1:🏄 → same.

Run 4-5 (length 2). So 1 run.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nRows 0-5: [🐠, 🎋, 🏄, 🎋, 🏄, 🐠]\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\nRow0:🐠, row1:🎋 → different.\n\nRow1:🎋, row2:🏄 → different.\n\nRow2:🏄, row3:🎋 → different.\n\nRow3:🎋, row4:🏄 → different.\n\nRow4:🏄, row5:🐠 → different. 0.\n\nColumn 5:\n\nRows 0-5: [🏄, ⛅️, 🏄, 🎋, 🏄, 🏄]\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\nRow0:🏄, row1:⛅️ → different.\n\nRow1:⛅️, row2:🏄 → different.\n\nRow2:🏄, row3:🎋 → different.\n\nRow3:🎋, row4:🏄 → different.\n\nRow4:🏄, row5:🏄 → same. Run 4-5 (length 2). So 1 run.\n\nSo vertical lines: column0 (1) + column1 (0) + column2 (2) + column3 (1) + column4 (0) + column5 (1) = 1+0+2+1+0+1=5.\n\nTotal lines: horizontal (4) + vertical (5) = 9.\n\nWait, but let's recheck.\n\nLet's recheck horizontal:\n\nRow 2: \"🦉🎋🦉🎋🏄🏄\" → positions 4 and 5 are 🏄, 🏄. So run of 2. So 1. Correct.\n\nRow 3: \"⛅️🐠🐠🦉🎋🎋\" → positions 1-2 (🐠,🐠) → run of 2. positions 4-5 (🎋,🎋) → run of 2. So 2. Correct.\n\nRow 4: \"🎋🦉🏄🎋🏄🏄\" → positions 4-5 (🏄,🏄). So 1. Correct.\n\nOthers: 0. So 1+2+1=4. Correct.\n\nVertical lines:\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRows 0: 🐠, row1:🦉, row2:🦉. So row1 and row2 are same. So run of 2 (rows1-2). Correct. 1.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow0:🏄, row1:🏄 → same (run 0-1, length 2). Row4:🏄, row5:🏄 → same (run 4-5, length 2). So 2. Correct.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow4:🎋, row5:🎋 → same. Run 4-5, length 2. 1.

So the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines where the same emoji repeats with a length of 2 or more. Hmm. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to check each row for horizontal sequences and each column for vertical sequences. For each direction, any consecutive same emojis of length >=2 count as a line. But wait, how do overlapping sequences count? Like, if there's a sequence of 3 same emojis, does that count as one line (length 3) or two (length 2 and 3)? Oh right, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with length of 2 or more\". So a sequence of length k (k >=2) contributes (k-1) lines? Or is it each possible consecutive pair? Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's take an example. Suppose a row has \"A A A\". The horizontal lines here are: positions (0,1) as A's (length 2), (1,2) as A's (length 2), and (0,1,2) as a length 3. But the problem statement says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So each such consecutive run of length m (m >=2) contributes (m - 1) lines? Or is each run of length m contributes 1 line? Because the question is to count the number of such lines.\n\nWait, the problem statement says \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So a line is a consecutive sequence of same emojis of length 2 or more. So a run of length 3 has one line of length 3, a run of length 2 has one line. But if a run is longer than 2, like 4, then how? For example, \"AAAA\" has runs of 4. So that's one line of length 4. So each consecutive run of same emojis (length >=2) counts as 1 line, regardless of how long it is (as long as it's >=2). Because a line is the entire consecutive sequence. So \"AA\" is 1 line, \"AAA\" is 1 line, \"AAAA\" is 1 line, etc. Because the line is the entire consecutive stretch.\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify. Let's look at the example given. Suppose a row is \"AAABBB\". Then in horizontal direction, there's a run of 3 A's (length 3 >=2) and a run of 3 B's (length 3 >=2). So that's 2 lines. If a row is \"AABBA\", then the runs are AA (length 2), BB (length 2), A (length 1). So 2 lines. So the correct approach is to count each consecutive run of the same emoji with length >=2, each such run is one line.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because a \"line\" here refers to the consecutive segment. So each such segment (horizontal or vertical) of length >=2 counts as 1.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each row in the board, process each row to find all consecutive runs of the same emoji with length >=2. Count each such run as 1.\n\n2. For each column in the board, process each column to find all consecutive runs of the same emoji with length >=2. Count each such run as 1.\n\nSum these counts to get the total.\n\nSo first, let's process the rows (horizontal lines). Then the columns (vertical lines).\n\nLet's start by writing down the board. The board is given as 7 rows (since each line is a row). Let's index rows from 0 to 6, and columns 0 to 6 (since each row has 7 emojis).\n\nLet's list each row:\n\nRow 0: 🦒😆🐯🌴🐯😆☄️\nSo the emojis are: [🦒, 😆, 🐯, 🌴, 🐯, 😆, ☄️]\n\nRow 1: 🦏🐯🦒☄️🦏🦏🦏\nEmojis: [🦏, 🐯, 🦒, ☄️, 🦏, 🦏, 🦏]\n\nRow 2: 🌴☄️☄️🦏🦒🌴🌴\nEmojis: [🌴, ☄️, ☄️, 🦏, 🦒, 🌴, 🌴]\n\nRow 3: ☄️😆🦢🦏🐯🦢🦏\nEmojis: [☄️, 😆, 🦢, 🦏, 🐯, 🦢, 🦏]\n\nRow 4: 🦒😆🌴🐯🦒🐯🌴\nEmojis: [🦒, 😆, 🌴, 🐯, 🦒, 🐯, 🌴]\n\nRow 5: 😆🦒🦢🦢😆🦒😆\nEmojis: [😆, 🦒, 🦢, 🦢, 😆, 🦒, 😆]\n\nRow 6: 🌴😆🦒🦏🦢☄️🐯\nEmojis: [🌴, 😆, 🦒, 🦏, 🦢, ☄️, 🐯]\n\nNow, let's process each row for horizontal runs.\n\nRow 0: [🦒, 😆, 🐯, 🌴, 🐯, 😆, ☄️]\n\nCheck consecutive same. Let's go through each position:\n\n0: 🦒. Next is 😆 (different). So run length 1.\n\n1: 😆. Next is 🐯 (different). Run length 1.\n\n2: 🐯. Next is 🌴 (different). Run length 1.\n\n3: 🌴. Next is 🐯 (different). Run length 1.\n\n4: 🐯. Next is 😆 (different). Run length 1.\n\n5: 😆. Next is ☄️ (different). Run length 1.\n\n6: ☄️. End. So no runs of length >=2. So row 0 contributes 0.\n\nRow 1: [🦏, 🐯, 🦒, ☄️, 🦏, 🦏, 🦏]\n\nCheck:\n\n0: 🦏. Next is 🐯 (diff). Run 1.\n\n1: 🐯. Next 🦒 (diff). Run 1.\n\n2: 🦒. Next ☄️ (diff). Run 1.\n\n3: ☄️. Next 🦏 (diff). Run 1.\n\n4: 🦏. Next 🦏 (same). Let's track:\n\nStart at 4. Next 5 is same (🦏), 6 is same (🦏). So the run is positions 4-6: length 3. So this is a run of 3, which is >=2. So count 1.\n\nSo row 1 contributes 1.\n\nRow 2: [🌴, ☄️, ☄️, 🦏, 🦒, 🌴, 🌴]\n\nCheck:\n\n0: 🌴. Next ☄️ (diff). Run 1.\n\n1: ☄️. Next ☄️ (same). So start at 1. Next 2 is same (☄️). So run 1-2: length 2. Count 1.\n\nThen 2: ☄️. Next 3 is 🦏 (diff). So that's the end of the run.\n\n3: 🦏. Next 🦒 (diff). Run 1.\n\n4: 🦒. Next 🌴 (diff). Run 1.\n\n5: 🌴. Next 🌴 (same). So 5-6: length 2. Count 1.\n\nSo row 2 has two runs: positions 1-2 (☄️☄️) and 5-6 (🌴🌴). So contributes 2.\n\nRow 3: [☄️, 😆, 🦢, 🦏, 🐯, 🦢, 🦏]\n\nCheck each:\n\n0: ☄️ → 😆 (diff). Run 1.\n\n1: 😆 → 🦢 (diff). Run 1.\n\n2: 🦢 → 🦏 (diff). Run 1.\n\n3: 🦏 → 🐯 (diff). Run 1.\n\n4: 🐯 → 🦢 (diff). Run 1.\n\n5: 🦢 → 🦏 (diff). Run 1.\n\n6: 🦏. End. No runs of >=2. So row 3 contributes 0.\n\nRow 4: [🦒, 😆, 🌴, 🐯, 🦒, 🐯, 🌴]\n\nCheck:\n\n0: 🦒 → 😆 (diff). Run 1.\n\n1: 😆 → 🌴 (diff). Run 1.\n\n2: 🌴 → 🐯 (diff). Run 1.\n\n3: 🐯 → 🦒 (diff). Run 1.\n\n4: 🦒 → 🐯 (diff). Run 1.\n\n5: 🐯 → 🌴 (diff). Run 1.\n\n6: 🌴. End. No runs. So row 4 contributes 0.\n\nRow 5: [😆, 🦒, 🦢, 🦢, 😆, 🦒, 😆]\n\nCheck:\n\n0: 😆 → 🦒 (diff). Run 1.\n\n1: 🦒 → 🦢 (diff). Run 1.\n\n2: 🦢 → 🦢 (same). So start at 2. Next 3 is same (🦢). So 2-3: length 2. Count 1.\n\n3: 🦢 → 😆 (diff). End of run.\n\n4: 😆 → 🦒 (diff). Run 1.\n\n5: 🦒 → 😆 (diff). Run 1.\n\n6: 😆. End. So row 5 contributes 1.\n\nRow 6: [🌴, 😆, 🦒, 🦏, 🦢, ☄️, 🐯]\n\nCheck all consecutive:\n\nEach adjacent pair is different. So 0-1: 🌴 vs 😆 (diff). 1-2: 😆 vs 🦒 (diff). 2-3: 🦒 vs 🦏 (diff). 3-4: 🦏 vs 🦢 (diff). 4-5: 🦢 vs ☄️ (diff). 5-6: ☄️ vs 🐯 (diff). So no runs. So row 6 contributes 0.\n\nSo total horizontal lines: 0 (row0) + 1 (row1) + 2 (row2) + 0 (row3) + 0 (row4) + 1 (row5) + 0 (row6) = 4.\n\nNow, vertical lines. Need to check each column. There are 7 columns (0-6). Each column has 7 emojis (rows 0-6).\n\nLet's list each column.\n\nColumn 0: [Row0[0], Row1[0], Row2[0], Row3[0], Row4[0], Row5[0], Row6[0]] → [🦒, 🦏, 🌴, ☄️, 🦒, 😆, 🌴]\n\nColumn 1: [Row0[1], Row1[1], Row2[1], Row3[1], Row4[1], Row5[1], Row6[1]] → [😆, 🐯, ☄️, 😆, 😆, 🦒, 😆]\n\nColumn 2: [Row0[2], Row1[2], Row2[2], Row3[2], Row4[2], Row5[2], Row6[2]] → [🐯, 🦒, ☄️, 🦢, 🌴, 🦢, 🦒]\n\nColumn 3: [Row0[3], Row1[3], Row2[3], Row3[3], Row4[3], Row5[3], Row6[3]] → [🌴, ☄️, 🦏, 🦏, 🐯, 🦢, 🦏]\n\nColumn 4: [Row0[4], Row1[4], Row2[4], Row3[4], Row4[4], Row5[4], Row6[4]] → [🐯, 🦏, 🦒, 🐯, 🦒, 😆, 🦢]\n\nColumn 5: [Row0[5], Row1[5], Row2[5], Row3[5], Row4[5], Row5[5], Row6[5]] → [😆, 🦏, 🌴, 🦢, 🐯, 🦒, ☄️]\n\nColumn 6: [Row0[6], Row1[6], Row2[6], Row3[6], Row4[6], Row5[6], Row6[6]] → [☄️, 🦏, 🌴, 🦏, 🌴, 😆, 🐯]\n\nNow, process each column for consecutive runs of same emoji (length >=2).\n\nLet's go column by column.\n\nColumn 0: [🦒, 🦏, 🌴, ☄️, 🦒, 😆, 🌴]\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\nRow0: 🦒. Row1: 🦏 (diff). Run 1.\n\nRow1: 🦏. Row2: 🌴 (diff). Run 1.\n\nRow2: 🌴. Row3: ☄️ (diff). Run 1.\n\nRow3: ☄️. Row4: 🦒 (diff). Run 1.\n\nRow4: 🦒. Row5: 😆 (diff). Run 1.\n\nRow5: 😆. Row6: 🌴 (diff). Run 1. No runs. Column 0 contributes 0.\n\nColumn 1: [😆, 🐯, ☄️, 😆, 😆, 🦒, 😆]\n\nCheck:\n\nRow0: 😆. Row1: 🐯 (diff). Run 1.\n\nRow1: 🐯. Row2: ☄️ (diff). Run 1.\n\nRow2: ☄️. Row3: 😆 (diff). Run 1.\n\nRow3: 😆. Row4: 😆 (same). So start at row3. Check row4: same. So 3-4: length 2. Then row4: 😆. Row5: 🦒 (diff). So this run is 3-4 (length 2). Count 1.\n\nRow5: 🦒. Row6: 😆 (diff). Run 1.\n\nRow6: 😆. End. So column 1 has 1 run. Contributes 1.\n\nColumn 2: [🐯, 🦒, ☄️, 🦢, 🌴, 🦢, 🦒]\n\nCheck:\n\nRow0: 🐯. Row1: 🦒 (diff). Run 1.\n\nRow1: 🦒. Row2: ☄️ (diff). Run 1.\n\nRow2: ☄️. Row3: 🦢 (diff). Run 1.\n\nRow3: 🦢. Row4: 🌴 (diff). Run 1.\n\nRow4: 🌴. Row5: 🦢 (diff). Run 1.\n\nRow5: 🦢. Row6: 🦒 (diff). Run 1. No runs.

So 2-3: length 2. Then row3: 🦏. Row4: 🐯 (diff). So run is 2-3 (length 2). Count 1.\n\nRow4: 🐯. Row5: 🦢 (diff). Run 1.\n\nRow5: 🦢. Row6: 🦏 (diff). Run 1. So column 3 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 4: [🐯, 🦏, 🦒, 🐯, 🦒, 😆, 🦢]\n\nCheck:\n\nRow0: 🐯. Row1: 🦏 (diff). Run 1.\n\nRow1: 🦏. Row2: 🦒 (diff). Run 1.\n\nRow2: 🦒. Row3: 🐯 (diff). Run 1.\n\nRow3: 🐯.

Column 4 contributes 0.\n\nColumn 5: [😆, 🦏, 🌴, 🦢, 🐯, 🦒, ☄️]\n\nCheck all consecutive pairs:\n\nRow0: 😆 vs row1: 🦏 (diff). \n\nRow1: 🦏 vs row2: 🌴 (diff). \n\nRow2: 🌴 vs row3: 🦢 (diff). \n\nRow3: 🦢 vs row4: 🐯 (diff). \n\nRow4: 🐯 vs row5: 🦒 (diff). \n\nRow5: 🦒 vs row6: ☄️ (diff). \n\nNo runs.

Oh, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". So, a consecutive run of k same emojis (k ≥ 2) will have (k-1) such lines.

Correct. 9.\n\nHorizontal sum 11. 11+9=20. That's the total.\n\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more. A line of length \\( k \\) (where \\( k \\geq 2 \\)) contributes \\( k-1 \\) to the total count, as each consecutive pair in the line forms a valid segment of length 2.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Horizontal Lines**: For each row, check consecutive sequences of the same emoji.

The task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines of the same emoji with length 2 or more. So, I need to check each row for horizontal sequences and each column for vertical sequences. \n\nFirst, let's think about horizontal lines. For each row, I'll go through each position and see how long the consecutive same emojis are. For example, if a row has \"😁😁😁\", that's a sequence of length 3. For such a sequence, how many lines do we count? Let's see. A sequence of length L contributes (L-1) lines. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So a line is a consecutive run of 2 or more. So for a run of length L (≥2), how many such lines are there? Let's clarify. For example, a run of 2: that's 1 line. A run of 3: the possible lines are positions 0-1, 1-2, and 0-2? Wait no, no. Because a line is a consecutive sequence of 2 or more. So a run of 3 same emojis has 1 line of length 3. Or does each possible consecutive pair count? Wait, the problem statement says \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So, for example, a horizontal line of 3 same emojis would be considered as a single line (length 3), and a line of 2 is a single line. But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's take an example. Suppose a row has \"A A A\". Then the horizontal lines here are: the first two A's (positions 0-1), the next two (1-2), and the three (0-2)? Or is the entire run considered one line? The problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So a line is a consecutive sequence of 2 or more same emojis. So the entire run is considered a single line. Because a line is a consecutive segment. For example, \"AA\" is a line of length 2. \"AAA\" is a line of length 3, which is also a valid line. So for a run of length L, where L ≥2, we count 1 line. Because it's a single line of length L. So if there's a run of 4, that's 1 line (length 4). But wait, maybe the problem counts overlapping lines? Let's read the problem statement again. The question says \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So, for example, a horizontal line is a consecutive sequence of 2 or more same emojis in a row. Each such consecutive sequence (of length ≥2) counts as 1. So, in a row like \"AAABBB\", there are two lines: the \"AAA\" (length 3) and the \"BBB\" (length 3). If the row is \"AABBA\", then there's \"AA\" (length 2) and \"BB\" (length 2), so 2 lines. If the row is \"AAAA\", that's 1 line (length 4). \n\nSo the approach for horizontal lines would be: for each row, split into consecutive runs of the same emoji. For each run, if the length is ≥2, add 1 to the count. Similarly for vertical lines: for each column, split into consecutive runs of the same emoji, and add 1 for each run with length ≥2.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because a line is a consecutive segment of 2 or more same emojis. So each such segment is a line. So, for example, \"AA\" is 1 line. \"AAA\" is 1 line (the entire 3-length). \"AABAA\" would have \"AA\" (positions 0-1) as 1 line, and \"AA\" (positions 3-4) as another line. So 2 lines.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each row in the board:\n   a. Iterate through the row, tracking current emoji and the start of the current run.\n   b. When the emoji changes, check if the previous run's length is ≥2. If yes, increment the count.\n   c. Also, after the row ends, check the last run.\n\n2. Do the same for each column:\n   a. For each column index, iterate through each row's element at that column.\n   b. Track current emoji and run length.\n   c. When the emoji changes, check previous run length, add to count if ≥2.\n   d. Check the last run after column ends.\n\nSo let's start by processing the rows first.\n\nThe board is given as 10 rows (since each line is a row, and there are 10 lines). Let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: 🐳😁😁🦒🌝🚀🦖🌝🚀🌝\nRow 1: 🧽🌝😁😁🚀🐳🚀🦒🦖🧽\nRow 2: 😁😁🐳😁🌝🦖🦜🌝🦖😁\nRow 3: 🦒🐳🌝🧽🐳🧽🌝🧽🧽🦜\nRow 4: 🧽🌹🦖🦜🐳🐳🧽🦜🧽🦒\nRow 5: 🐳🚀😁🦖😁😁🦒🦖🦖🦒\nRow 6: 🦖🚀🦒🦖🌝🌝🧽🚀🌹🚀\nRow 7: 🧽🧽🧽🧽🐳🧽🐳🚀🌝😁\nRow 8: 🌹🐳🚀🦜🦒🦜🦖🌹🌝😁\nRow 9: 🌹🦜🦜🌝🦖🦜🌹🦖🚀😁\n\nLet's process each row one by one.\n\nRow 0: 🐳😁😁🦒🌝🚀🦖🌝🚀🌝\n\nLet's list the emojis in order:\nIndex 0: 🐳\n1: 😁\n2: 😁\n3: 🦒\n4: 🌝\n5: 🚀\n6: 🦖\n7: 🌝\n8: 🚀\n9: 🌝\n\nLooking for consecutive runs:\n\n- 🐳 (length 1) → no\n- 😁 at 1-2 (length 2) → yes.

Count 1.\n- 🐳 (1) → no\n- 🧽 (1) → no\n- 🐳 (1) → no\n- 🚀 (1) → no\n- 🌝 (1) → no\n- 😁 (1) → no\nRow 7 contributes 1.\n\nRow 8: 🌹🐳🚀🦜🦒🦜🦖🌹🌝😁\n\nEmojis:\n0: 🌹\n1: 🐳\n2: 🚀\n3: 🦜\n4: 🦒\n5: 🦜\n6: 🦖\n7: 🌹\n8: 🌝\n9: 😁\n\nRuns: All single. No runs of 2 or more. So row 8 contributes 0.\n\nRow 9: 🌹🦜🦜🌝🦖🦜🌹🦖🚀😁\n\nEmojis:\n0: 🌹\n1: 🦜\n2: 🦜\n3: 🌝\n4: 🦖\n5: 🦜\n6: 🌹\n7: 🦖\n8: 🚀\n9: 😁\n\nRuns:\n- 🦜 at 1-2 (length 2) → yes. Count 1.\nOthers are single. So row 9 contributes 1.\n\nSo summing up rows: 1+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+0+1 = 10.\n\nNow let's process columns. There are 10 columns (since each row has 10 emojis). For each column index (0-9), we check each row's element in that column.\n\nLet's list each column's elements:\n\nColumn 0 (index 0):\nRow 0: 🐳\nRow 1: 🧽\nRow 2: 😁\nRow 3: 🦒\nRow 4: 🧽\nRow 5: 🐳\nRow 6: 🦖\nRow 7: 🧽\nRow 8: 🌹\nRow 9: 🌹\nSo elements: 🐳, 🧽, 😁, 🦒, 🧽, 🐳, 🦖, 🧽, 🌹, 🌹\n\nCheck runs:\n- 🐳 (1) → no\n- 🧽 (1) → no\n- 😁 (1) → no\n- 🦒 (1) → no\n- 🧽 (1) → no\n- 🐳 (1) → no\n- 🦖 (1) → no\n- 🧽 (1) → no\n- 🌹 at 8-9 (length 2) → yes.

Count 1.\n- 🧽 at 3-4 (length 2) → yes. Count 1.\n- 🌝 at 7-8 (length 2) → yes. Count 1.\nSo column 8 contributes 3.\n\nColumn 9 (index 9):\nRow 0: 🌝\nRow 1: 🧽\nRow 2: 😁\nRow 3: 🦜\nRow 4: 🦒\nRow 5: 🦒\nRow 6: 🚀\nRow 7: 😁\nRow 8: 😁\nRow 9: 😁\nElements: 🌝, 🧽, 😁, 🦜, 🦒, 🦒, 🚀, 😁, 😁, 😁\n\nRuns:\n- 🦒 at 4-5 (length 2) → yes. Count 1.\n- 😁 at 7-8-9 (length 3) → yes. Count 1 (since it's a single run of 3).\nSo column 9 contributes 2.\n\nNow let's sum the column contributions:\n\nColumn 0:1, 1:1, 2:1, 3:2, 4:1, 5:1, 6:0, 7:1, 8:3, 9:2.\n\nAdding these up: 1+1=2; +1=3; +2=5; +1=6; +1=7; +0=7; +1=8; +3=11; +2=13. So column total is 13.\n\nTotal lines: row total (10) + column total (13) = 23.\n\nWait, let's recheck the columns to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet's recheck column 8:\n\nColumn 8 elements (row 0-9):\nRow 0: 🚀\nRow 1: 🦖\nRow 2: 🦖\nRow 3: 🧽\nRow 4: 🧽\nRow 5: 🦖\nRow 6: 🌹\nRow 7: 🌝\nRow 8: 🌝\nRow 9: 🚀\n\nSo the runs:\n\nRow 0: 🚀 (1)\nRow 1-2: 🦖 (2) → count 1.\nRow 3-4: 🧽 (2) → count 1.\nRow 5: 🦖 (1)\nRow 6: 🌹 (1)\nRow 7-8: 🌝 (2) → count 1.\nRow 9: 🚀 (1)\nSo 3 runs. So 3. Correct.\n\nColumn 9:\n\nElements:\nRow 0: 🌝\nRow 1: 🧽\nRow 2: 😁\nRow 3: 🦜\nRow 4: 🦒\nRow 5: 🦒 (so 4-5: 2 → count 1)\nRow 6: 🚀\nRow 7: 😁\nRow 8: 😁\nRow 9: 😁 (so 7-8-9: 3 → count 1)\nSo 2. Correct.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nElements:\nRow 0: 🦒\nRow 1: 😁\nRow 2: 😁 (1-2: 2 → count 1)\nRow 3: 🧽\nRow 4: 🦜\nRow 5: 🦖\nRow 6: 🦖 (5-6: 2 → count 1)\nRow 7: 🧽\nRow 8: 🦜\nRow 9: 🌝\nSo 2. Correct.\n\nRow 5 had 2 runs (😁 at 4-5, and 🦖 at 7-8 → 2). Correct.\n\nRow 7: 4 🧽s → 1 run. Correct.\n\nRow 9: 🦜 at 1-2 → 1. Correct.\n\nRow 0: 😁 at 1-2 → 1. Correct.\n\nRow 5's elements: [🐳, 🚀, 😁, 🦖, 😁, 😁, 🦒, 🦖, 🦖, 🦒]\n\nYes, 4-5: 😁😁 (length 2) → 1. 7-8: 🦖🦖 (length 2) → 1. So 2. Correct.\n\nSo rows sum to 10. Columns sum to 13. Total 23.\n\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more. A \"line\" is defined as a consecutive sequence of 2 or more identical emojis in a row (horizontal) or column (vertical).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Horizontal Lines**: For each row, identify consecutive runs of the same emoji. If a run has a length of 2 or more, it counts as one horizontal line.\n2. **Vertical Lines**: For each column, identify consecutive runs of the same emoji. If a run has a length of 2 or more, it counts as one vertical line.\n\n### Solution Code\nWe analyze each row and column to count valid lines:\n\n#### Horizontal Lines Analysis\n- **Row 0**: `🐳😁😁🦒🌝🚀🦖🌝🚀🌝` → 1 line (😁😁)\n- **Row 1**: `🧽🌝😁😁🚀🐳🚀🦒🦖🧽` → 1 line (😁😁)\n- **Row 2**: `😁😁🐳😁🌝🦖🦜🌝🦖😁` → 1 line (😁😁)\n- **Row 3**: `🦒🐳🌝🧽🐳🧽🌝🧽🧽🦜` → 1 line (🧽🧽)\n- **Row 4**: `🧽🌹🦖🦜🐳🐳🧽🦜🧽🦒` → 1 line (🐳🐳)\n- **Row 5**: `🐳🚀😁🦖😁😁🦒🦖🦖🦒` → 2 lines (😁😁, 🦖🦖)\n- **Row 6**: `🦖🚀🦒🦖🌝🌝🧽🚀🌹🚀` → 1 line (🌝🌝)\n- **Row 7**: `🧽🧽🧽🧽🐳🧽🐳🚀🌝😁` → 1 line (🧽🧽🧽🧽)\n- **Row 8**: `🌹🐳🚀🦜🦒🦜🦖🌹🌝😁` → 0 lines\n- **Row 9**: `🌹🦜🦜🌝🦖🦜🌹🦖🚀😁` → 1 line (🦜🦜)\n\n**Total Horizontal Lines**: \\(1+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+0+1 = 10\\)\n\n#### Vertical Lines Analysis\n- **Column 0**: `🐳, 🧽, 😁, 🦒, 🧽, 🐳, 🦖, 🧽, 🌹, 🌹` → 1 line (🌹🌹)\n- **Column 1**: `😁, 🌝, 😁, 🐳, 🌹, 🚀, 🚀, 🧽, 🐳, 🦜` → 1 line (🚀🚀)\n- **Column 2**: `😁, 😁, 🐳, 🌝, 🦖, 😁, 🦒, 🧽, 🚀, 🦜` → 1 line (😁😁)\n- **Column 3**: `🦒, 😁, 😁, 🧽, 🦜, 🦖, 🦖, 🧽, 🦜, 🌝` → 2 lines (😁😁, 🦖🦖)\n- **Column 4**: `🌝, 🚀, 🌝, 🐳, 🐳, 😁, 🌝, 🐳, 🦒, 🦖` → 1 line (🐳🐳)\n- **Column 5**: `🚀, 🐳, 😁, 🧽, 🐳, 😁, 🌝, 🧽, 🦜, 🦜` → 1 line (🦜🦜)\n- **Column 6**: `🦖, 🚀, 🦜, 🌝, 🧽, 🦒, 🧽, 🐳, 🦖, 🌹` → 0 lines\n- **Column 7**: `🌝, 🦒, 🌝, 🧽, 🦜, 🦖, 🚀, 🚀, 🌹, 🦖` → 1 line (🚀🚀)\n- **Column 8**: `🚀, 🦖, 🦖, 🧽, 🧽, 🦖, 🌹, 🌝, 🌝, 🚀` → 3 lines (🦖🦖, 🧽🧽, 🌝🌝)\n- **Column 9**: `🌝, 🧽, 😁, 🦜, 🦒, 🦒, 🚀, 😁, 😁, 😁` → 2 lines (🦒🦒, 😁😁😁)\n\n**Total Vertical Lines**: \\(1+1+1+2+1+1+0+1+3+2 = 13\\)\n\n### Final Result\nThe total number of horizontal and vertical lines is \\(10 + 13 = 23\\).\n\nAnswer: 23"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

So, the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, where each line has a length of 2 or more. Hmm. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to process the board. Let's visualize the board. The board given is 7 rows by 7 columns, right? Let's list each row to make it easier. Let's index rows from 0 to 6 and columns 0 to 6.\n\nRow 0: 🐍💥🐢🐭🐭🌑🌑 → So the elements are [0][0]=🐍, [0][1]=💥, [0][2]=🐢, [0][3]=🐭, [0][4]=🐭, [0][5]=🌑, [0][6]=🌑\nRow 1: 🐍🐭💥🐍🐭💥🐭 → [1][0]=🐍, [1][1]=🐭, [1][2]=💥, [1][3]=🐍, [1][4]=🐭, [1][5]=💥, [1][6]=🐭\nRow 2: 🐍🐭🐢🐭🐍🐍🐍 → [2][0]=🐍, [2][1]=🐭, [2][2]=🐢, [2][3]=🐭, [2][4]=🐍, [2][5]=🐍, [2][6]=🐍\nRow 3: 🐍🌑💥💥🌿🐍🌑 → [3][0]=🐍, [3][1]=🌑, [3][2]=💥, [3][3]=💥, [3][4]=🌿, [3][5]=🐍, [3][6]=🌑\nRow 4: 🐢🐢🐭🌿🌑🌑🐢 → [4][0]=🐢, [4][1]=🐢, [4][2]=🐭, [4][3]=🌿, [4][4]=🌑, [4][5]=🌑, [4][6]=🐢\nRow 5: 🌑🐢🐭🐢💥🌑🐭 → [5][0]=🌑, [5][1]=🐢, [5][2]=🐭, [5][3]=🐢, [5][4]=💥, [5][5]=🌑, [5][6]=🐭\nRow 6: 🌑🌿🌿🐭💥💥🐭 → [6][0]=🌑, [6][1]=🌿, [6][2]=🌿, [6][3]=🐭, [6][4]=💥, [6][5]=💥, [6][6]=🐭\n\nSo, for each row, check horizontal sequences. For each column, check vertical sequences. Each sequence of length L (L≥2) contributes (L-1) lines. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So, a line is a consecutive sequence of the same emoji of length ≥2. Each such consecutive run is a line. So, for example, if a row has \"AAABBB\", then horizontal lines are AAA (length 3) and BBB (length 3), each counts as 1 line. Because each is a consecutive sequence of the same emoji with length ≥2. So, each run of length k (k≥2) counts as 1 line. So, the total is the number of such runs in all rows (horizontal) and all columns (vertical).\n\nWait, the problem says \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So a line is a consecutive sequence of same emoji in a row (horizontal) or column (vertical), with length 2 or more. So for a run of 2 same emojis, that's 1 line. A run of 3 same emojis is 1 line (since it's a single line of length 3). A run of 4 is 1 line, etc.\n\nSo for each row, we need to find all consecutive sequences of the same emoji of length ≥2. Each such sequence is a line, so count 1 per sequence. Same for each column.\n\nSo, let's process each row first (horizontal lines):\n\nRow 0: 🐍💥🐢🐭🐭🌑🌑 → Let's list the elements in order. Let's check consecutive runs.\n\nCheck each position:\n\n- [0][0] = 🐍. Next is [0][1] = 💥 → different. So run length 1 (no line).\n- [0][1] = 💥. Next [0][2] = 🐢 → different. Run length 1.\n- [0][2] = 🐢. Next [0][3] = 🐭 → different. Run length 1.\n- [0][3] = 🐭. Next [0][4] = 🐭 → same. Then [0][5] = 🌑 → different. So run from 3-4 (length 2). That's a horizontal line. Count 1.\n- [0][4] = 🐭. Next [0][5] = 🌑 → different. So already counted above.\n- [0][5] = 🌑. Next [0][6] = 🌑 → same. Run from 5-6 (length 2). Count 1.\nSo row 0 has 2 horizontal lines.\n\nRow 1: 🐍🐭💥🐍🐭💥🐭 → Check runs.\n\nEach element:\n\n- [1][0] 🐍 → next is 🐭 → different. Run 1.\n- [1][1] 🐭 → next 💥 → different. Run 1.\n- [1][2] 💥 → next 🐍 → different. Run 1.\n- [1][3] 🐍 → next 🐭 → different. Run 1.\n- [1][4] 🐭 → next 💥 → different. Run 1.\n- [1][5] 💥 → next 🐭 → different. Run 1.\n- [1][6] 🐭 → no next. Run 1. So row 1 has 0 horizontal lines.\n\nRow 2: 🐍🐭🐢🐭🐍🐍🐍 → Check runs.\n\n- [2][0] 🐍 → next 🐭 → different. Run 1.\n- [2][1] 🐭 → next 🐢 → different. Run 1.\n- [2][2] 🐢 → next 🐭 → different. Run 1.\n- [2][3] 🐭 → next 🐍 → different. Run 1.\n- [2][4] 🐍 → next [2][5] 🐍 → same. Then [2][6] 🐍 → same. So run from 4-6 (length 3).

So the answer should be 18.\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, where each line has a length of 2 or more. A \"line\" is defined as a consecutive sequence of the same emoji in either a row (horizontal) or column (vertical) with a length of at least 2.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Horizontal Lines**: For each row, identify consecutive sequences of the same emoji with length ≥ 2. Each such sequence counts as one horizontal line.\n2. **Vertical Lines**: For each column, identify consecutive sequences of the same emoji with length ≥ 2. Each such sequence counts as one vertical line.\n3. **Summing Lines**: Sum the total number of horizontal and vertical lines to get the final result.\n\n### Solution Code\nThe board is given as a 7x7 grid.

The task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more. Hmm. So, first, I need to go through each row (horizontal) and each column (vertical) and check for consecutive same emojis of length 2 or longer. For each such consecutive sequence, I need to count how many lines there are. Wait, wait. Wait, what's a \"line\" here? Oh right, a line is a consecutive run of the same emoji. So, for example, if there's a row like \"A A A\", that's a horizontal line of length 3. But how do we count the number of such lines? Let's think.\n\nLet's clarify the problem. Suppose in a row, there's a sequence of k consecutive same emojis. The number of lines of length ≥2 in this sequence is (k-1). Because, for a run of length 2: 1 line. For length 3: 2 lines (positions 1-2, 2-3). For length 4: 3 lines (1-2, 2-3, 3-4). Oh right, because each line is a consecutive pair or longer, but each overlapping part counts. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". So a line is a consecutive sequence of length exactly 2, 3, etc. But each such sequence contributes 1 to the count. For example, \"AAA\" (3 A's) is a single line of length 3, which is ≥2, so it counts as 1. But wait, maybe the problem counts each possible consecutive run. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe question says: \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So a line is a consecutive sequence of the same emoji of length 2 or longer. Each such sequence is a line, regardless of its length (as long as ≥2). So for example, in a row like \"A A A\", there's one horizontal line (length 3). In a row like \"A A B B\", there are two horizontal lines (each of length 2). In \"A A A B B B\", two lines. But if there's \"A A A A\", that's one line of length 4.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's think of the problem as runs. Each run of the same emoji (consecutive) with length ≥2 contributes 1 to the count. So the task is to count all such runs in the horizontal and vertical directions.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, for example, in a horizontal row, if the row is \"🐰🐳🐘🦂🦂🌘...\", then looking at the 4th and 5th elements: 🦂🦂, that's a run of length 2. So that's one horizontal line. Then, in another part of the row, if there's a longer run, like three same emojis in a row, that's another line (counted once). So the plan is:\n\n1. For each row (horizontal direction), find all consecutive runs of the same emoji with length ≥2. Each such run counts as 1.\n\n2. For each column (vertical direction), do the same: find consecutive runs of same emoji with length ≥2. Each such run counts as 1.\n\n3. Sum all these runs (horizontal and vertical) to get the total.\n\nYes, that's the correct approach.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Iterate over each row in the board. For each row, process each position to find consecutive runs.\n\n- For a row, we can process it by checking consecutive elements. For example, start at index 0, check if current emoji is same as next. If so, find the length of the run. Then, if the length is ≥2, increment the count by 1. Then skip ahead to the end of the run to avoid overlapping.\n\nSimilarly for columns: iterate over each column index, then for each row in that column, check consecutive elements.\n\nLet's take a small example. Suppose a row is [A, A, A, B, B]. Then the runs are A (length 3) and B (length 2). So two horizontal lines. So that contributes 2 to the total.\n\nAnother example: a column with [C, C, C, D, D, D]. Then runs are C (3) and D (3), contributing 2 vertical lines.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each row:\n\n- Initialize current run emoji as the first element.\n\n- current run length starts at 1.\n\n- Then, for each next element in the row:\n\n   - if same as current run emoji, increment current run length.\n\n   - else:\n\n      - if current run length >=2, increment count.\n\n      - reset current run emoji to current element, current run length = 1.\n\n- After processing all elements in the row, check if the last run has length >=2, and increment count if so.\n\nDo the same for each column.\n\nSo now, let's process the given board.\n\nFirst, let's represent the board as a list of lists. Let's index rows from 0 to 9 (since there are 10 rows), and columns 0 to 9 (10 columns).\n\nThe board is:\n\nRow 0: 🐰🐳🐘🦂🦂🌘🐆🐬🐆🐬\nRow 1: 🐳🐳🥀🌘🐰🥀🌘🐻🐘🐬\nRow 2: 🐰🐬🦂🐏🐘🐆🐳🐻🥀🐏\nRow 3: 🐆🐘🌘🐘🐻🐏🥀🐘🥀🌘\nRow 4: 🐘🐰🐬🐬🐳🐆🐻🌘🌘🐰\nRow 5: 🥀🐰🐘🐻🐘🌘🐰🐏🥀🐏\nRow 6: 🦂🐘🦂🌘🐏🐆🐰🐰🥀🐳\nRow 7: 🐰🐆🐻🐻🐏🐆🐻🌘🌘🐻\nRow 8: 🐏🐆🐬🥀🐻🦂🌘🐏🐏🐆\nRow 9: 🥀🐬🥀🐰🦂🐻🐬🐆🥀🐏\n\nLet's process each row first (horizontal lines):\n\nRow 0: [🐰, 🐳, 🐘, 🦂, 🦂, 🌘, 🐆, 🐬, 🐆, 🐬]\n\nCheck consecutive runs:\n\n- 🐰 (1) → next is 🐳 (different). Run length 1 <2 → no count.\n\n- 🐳 (1) → next is 🐘 (diff). Run 1 → no.\n\n- 🐘 (1) → next is 🦂 (diff). Run 1 → no.\n\n- 🦂 (1) → next is 🦂 (same). Now run length 2. Then next element (index 4) is 🌘 (diff). So this run is length 2. Count +=1.\n\n- 🌘 (1) → next is 🐆 (diff). Run 1 → no.\n\n- 🐆 (1) → next is 🐬 (diff). Run 1 → no.\n\n- 🐬 (1) → next is 🐆 (diff).

So row 9 contributes 0.\n\nSo total horizontal lines: 1 (row0) + 1 (row1) + 0 (row2) + 0 (row3) + 2 (row4) + 0 (row5) + 1 (row6) + 2 (row7) + 1 (row8) + 0 (row9) → 1+1=2; +2=4; +1=5; +2=7; +1=8. So 8 horizontal lines.\n\nNow, process vertical lines (columns 0-9). Let's process each column (each column has 10 elements, rows 0-9).\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow 0: 🐰\n\nRow 1: 🐳\n\nRow 2: 🐰\n\nRow 3: 🐆\n\nRow 4: 🐘\n\nRow 5: 🥀\n\nRow 6: 🦂\n\nRow 7: 🐰\n\nRow 8: 🐏\n\nRow 9: 🥀\n\nCheck runs (vertical):\n\nEach consecutive pair:\n\nRow0-1: 🐰 vs 🐳 → diff.\n\nRow1-2: 🐳 vs 🐰 → diff.\n\nRow2-3: 🐰 vs 🐆 → diff.\n\nRow3-4: 🐆 vs 🐘 → diff.\n\nRow4-5: 🐘 vs 🥀 → diff.\n\nRow5-6: 🥀 vs 🦂 → diff.\n\nRow6-7: 🦂 vs 🐰 → diff.\n\nRow7-8: 🐰 vs 🐏 → diff.\n\nRow8-9: 🐏 vs 🥀 → diff.\n\nNo runs. So column 0 contributes 0.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow0: 🐳\n\nRow1: 🐳\n\nRow2: 🐬\n\nRow3: 🐘\n\nRow4: 🐰\n\nRow5: 🐰\n\nRow6: 🐘\n\nRow7: 🐆\n\nRow8: 🐆\n\nRow9: 🐬\n\nCheck runs:\n\nRow0: 🐳. Row1: 🐳. So same. Run starts at row0, length 2 (rows 0 and 1). Then row2 is 🐬 (diff). So this run is length 2 → count +=1.\n\nThen, row2: 🐬. row3: 🐘 → diff.\n\nrow3: 🐘. row4: 🐰 → diff.\n\nrow4: 🐰. row5: 🐰 → same. Run starts at row4, length 2 (rows4 and 5). row6 is 🐘 (diff). So run length 2 → count +=1.\n\nrow5: 🐰 (processed). row6: 🐘. row7: 🐆 → diff.\n\nrow7: 🐆. row8: 🐆 → same. Run starts at row7, length 2 (rows7 and 8). row9: 🐬 (diff). So run length 2 → count +=1.\n\nSo column 1 has 3 vertical lines.\n\nLet's confirm:\n\nRow0-1: 🐳🐳 → run of 2 → 1.\n\nRow4-5: 🐰🐰 → run of 2 → 1.\n\nRow7-8: 🐆🐆 → run of 2 → 1. Total 3. Correct.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow0: 🐘\n\nRow1: 🥀\n\nRow2: 🦂\n\nRow3: 🌘\n\nRow4: 🐬\n\nRow5: 🐘\n\nRow6: 🦂\n\nRow7: 🐻\n\nRow8: 🐬\n\nRow9: 🥀\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\nAll elements are different.

So row6 and row7: 🐏🐏. Run length 2. row8: 🐻 (diff). So count +=1.\n\nSo column 4 has 1.\n\nLet's confirm:\n\nRow6: 🐏, row7: 🐏 → run of 2. So 1.\n\nColumn 5:\n\nRow0: 🌘\n\nRow1: 🥀\n\nRow2: 🐆\n\nRow3: 🐏\n\nRow4: 🐆\n\nRow5: 🌘\n\nRow6: 🐆\n\nRow7: 🐆\n\nRow8: 🦂\n\nRow9: 🐻\n\nCheck runs:\n\nRow7: 🐆, row6: 🐆. So row6: 🐆, row7: 🐆. Run length 2. row8: 🦂 (diff). So count +=1.\n\nAny others? Let's check:\n\nRow0: 🌘 vs row1: 🥀 → diff.\n\nRow1: 🥀 vs row2: 🐆 → diff.\n\nRow2: 🐆 vs row3: 🐏 → diff.\n\nRow3: 🐏 vs row4: 🐆 → diff.\n\nRow4: 🐆 vs row5: 🌘 → diff.\n\nRow5: 🌘 vs row6: 🐆 → diff.\n\nRow6: 🐆 vs row7: 🐆 → same (run of 2). row8: 🦂 → diff.

So count +=1.\n\nLet's go step by step:\n\nRow0: 🐆 vs row1: 🐘 → diff.\n\nRow1: 🐘 vs row2: 🥀 → diff.\n\nRow2: 🥀 vs row3: 🥀 → same. Run length 2. row4: 🌘 → diff. → 1.\n\nRow3: 🥀 vs row4: 🌘 → diff.\n\nRow4: 🌘 vs row5: 🥀 → diff.\n\nRow5: 🥀 vs row6: 🥀 → same. Run length 2. row7: 🌘 → diff. → 1.

Run length 2. row2: 🐏 → diff. So count +=1.\n\nSo column9 has 1.\n\nNow let's list all columns and their contributions:\n\nColumn 0: 0\n\nColumn 1: 3\n\nColumn 2: 0\n\nColumn 3: 0\n\nColumn 4: 1\n\nColumn 5: 1\n\nColumn 6: 1\n\nColumn 7: 1\n\nColumn 8: 3\n\nColumn 9: 1\n\nLet's sum these: 3 + 1+1+1+1+3+1 = 3 (col1) + 1 (col4) +1 (col5) +1 (col6) +1 (col7) +3 (col8) +1 (col9) → 3+1=4; +1=5; +1=6; +1=7; +3=10; +1=11. So vertical lines total 11.\n\nWait, let's recount:\n\ncol1: 3 → 3.\n\ncol4: 1 → 3+1=4.\n\ncol5: 1 → 5.\n\ncol6: 1 → 6.\n\ncol7: 1 →7.\n\ncol8:3 →10.\n\ncol9:1 →11.\n\nYes. 3+1+1+1+1+3+1= 11.\n\nSo total lines: horizontal (8) + vertical (11) = 19.\n\nWait, let's recheck:\n\nHorizontal lines: 8.\n\nVertical lines: 11. 8+11=19.\n\nLet me recheck the vertical columns.\n\nColumn 1: 3 (correct: rows 0-1, 4-5, 7-8).\n\nColumn 4: 1 (row6-7).\n\nColumn 5: 1 (row6-7).\n\nColumn 6: 1 (row5-6).\n\nColumn7: 1 (row1-2).\n\nColumn8: 3 (rows2-3, 5-6, 8-9).\n\nColumn9:1 (rows0-1).\n\nYes. 3+1+1+1+1+3+1= 11.\n\nHorizontal lines:\n\nRow0:1, row1:1, row4:2, row6:1, row7:2, row8:1 → 1+1=2; +2=4; +1=5; +2=7; +1=8. Correct.\n\nSo 8+11=19. So the answer is 19.\n\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more in a given rectangular board. A line is defined as a consecutive sequence of the same emoji with a length of at least 2.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Horizontal Lines**: Iterate through each row of the board and check for consecutive sequences of the same emoji with length ≥ 2. Each such sequence is counted as one horizontal line.\n2. **Vertical Lines**: Iterate through each column of the board and check for consecutive sequences of the same emoji with length ≥ 2.

So, I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines where the same emoji appears with a length of 2 or more. Hmm. Let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the board. The input is a 6x6 grid (since there are 6 rows, each with 6 emojis). Each row is a horizontal line, each column a vertical line. For each of these, I need to check consecutive same emojis and count all sequences of length >=2. But wait, how are overlapping sequences counted? Like, if there's a sequence of 3 same emojis, does that count as one line (length 3) or two lines (length 2 and 3, or 2+1)? Let me think. The problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So a sequence of length k (k >=2) contributes (k-1) lines? Wait, no. Let's clarify. Suppose a horizontal row has \"A A A\". That's a single horizontal line of length 3. But maybe the problem counts each possible consecutive pair. Like, in \"A A A\", there are two overlapping pairs (positions 0-1 and 1-2), but the line is considered as one. Or perhaps each maximal run counts once. Let's read the problem statement again.\n\nThe question says \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So a \"line\" here is a consecutive sequence of the same emoji. For example, a horizontal line of length 3 (three in a row) would count as one line. Similarly, a vertical line of length 2 (two in a column) counts as one. So, for each horizontal row, we need to find all consecutive runs of the same emoji with length >=2, and each such run is a line. Similarly for vertical columns.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\n1. For each row (horizontal), check consecutive emojis. For each run of the same emoji of length l >=2, add 1 to the count.\n2. For each column (vertical), do the same: check consecutive emojis in the column, and for each run of length l >=2, add 1 to the count.\n3. Sum all these to get the total.\n\nLet's confirm with an example. Suppose a row is \"A A B B B\". Then, horizontal lines are \"AA\" (length 2) and \"BBB\" (length 3). So that's 2 lines. Similarly, if a column has \"C C C C\", that's a vertical line of length 4, so 1 line.\n\nOkay, so the plan is to process each row and column, find runs of same emojis, and count each run of length >=2 as 1.\n\nNow, let's get the board data. Let's list the rows first. Let's index rows from 0 to 5, columns 0 to 5.\n\nRow 0: 🦆🦆🦆🔥🔥🦆 → [🦆, 🦆, 🦆, 🔥, 🔥, 🦆]\nRow 1: 🦆🦆🔥🦆🦆🦆 → [🦆, 🦆, 🔥, 🦆, 🦆, 🦆]\nRow 2: 🦆🐧🔥🦆🐧🐧 → [🦆, 🐧, 🔥, 🦆, 🐧, 🐧]\nRow 3: 🔥🌑🦆🦆🌑🦆 → [🔥, 🌑, 🦆, 🦆, 🌑, 🦆]\nRow 4: 🔥🦆🦆🐧🌑🌑 → [🔥, 🦆, 🦆, 🐧, 🌑, 🌑]\nRow 5: 🐧🌑🐧🔥🦆🦆 → [🐧, 🌑, 🐧, 🔥, 🦆, 🦆]\n\nLet's process each row first (horizontal lines):\n\nRow 0: Check consecutive runs.\n\nStart at index 0: 🦆. Next is 🦆 (index 1), same. Next index 2: 🦆. So run from 0-2 (length 3). Then index 3: 🔥. Next index 4: 🔥. Run from 3-4 (length 2). Then index 5: 🦆 (single). So horizontal lines in row 0: 2 (3-length and 2-length).\n\nRow 1: [🦆, 🦆, 🔥, 🦆, 🦆, 🦆]\n\nRuns: 0-1 (🦆, length 2), then 2 (🔥, single), then 3-5 (🦆, length 3). So 2 lines.\n\nRow 2: [🦆, 🐧, 🔥, 🦆, 🐧, 🐧]\n\nCheck each:\n\n0: 🦆 (single, since next is 🐧). 1: 🐧 (next is 🔥, single). 2: 🔥 (single). 3: 🦆 (next is 🐧, single). 4-5: 🐧 (length 2). So 1 line.\n\nRow 3: [🔥, 🌑, 🦆, 🦆, 🌑, 🦆]\n\nRuns: 0: 🔥 (single). 1: 🌑 (single). 2-3: 🦆 (length 2). 4: 🌑 (single). 5: 🦆 (single). So 1 line.\n\nRow 4: [🔥, 🦆, 🦆, 🐧, 🌑, 🌑]\n\nRuns: 0: 🔥 (single). 1-2: 🦆 (length 2). 3: 🐧 (single). 4-5: 🌑 (length 2). So 2 lines.\n\nRow 5: [🐧, 🌑, 🐧, 🔥, 🦆, 🦆]\n\nRuns: 0: 🐧 (single). 1: 🌑 (single). 2: 🐧 (single). 3: 🔥 (single). 4-5: 🦆 (length 2). So 1 line.\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 2 (row0) + 2 (row1) + 1 (row2) + 1 (row3) + 2 (row4) + 1 (row5) = 2+2=4, +1=5, +1=6, +2=8, +1=9. So 9 horizontal lines.\n\nNow vertical lines (columns). Let's list each column (0-5) and check runs.\n\nColumn 0 (rows 0-5):\n\nRow 0: 🦆\n\nRow 1: 🦆\n\nRow 2: 🦆\n\nRow 3: 🔥\n\nRow 4: 🔥\n\nRow 5: 🐧\n\nSo column 0: [🦆, 🦆, 🦆, 🔥, 🔥, 🐧]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n0-2: 🦆 (length 3) → 1 line.\n\n3-4: 🔥 (length 2) → 1 line.\n\n5: 🐧 (single).

So the answer is 17.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, where each line has a length of 2 or more. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Horizontal Lines**: For each row in the board, identify consecutive sequences (runs) of the same emoji. Each run with a length of 2 or more counts as one horizontal line.\n2. **Vertical Lines**: For each column in the board, similarly identify consecutive sequences of the same emoji. Each run with a length of 2 or more counts as one vertical line.\n3. **Summing Lines**: The total number of lines is the sum of all horizontal and vertical lines.\n\n### Solution Code\nWe analyze the given board row by row and column by column to count valid lines:\n\n#### Horizontal Lines Analysis\n- **Row 0**: `🦆🦆🦆🔥🔥🦆`  \n  Runs: `🦆` (length 3), `🔥` (length 2) → 2 lines.  \n- **Row 1**: `🦆🦆🔥🦆🦆🦆`  \n  Runs: `🦆` (length 2), `🦆` (length 3) → 2 lines.  \n- **Row 2**: `🦆🐧🔥🦆🐧🐧`  \n  Runs: `🐧` (length 2) → 1 line.  \n- **Row 3**: `🔥🌑🦆🦆🌑🦆`  \n  Runs: `🦆` (length 2) → 1 line.  \n- **Row 4**: `🔥🦆🦆🐧🌑🌑`  \n  Runs: `🦆` (length 2), `🌑` (length 2) → 2 lines.  \n- **Row 5**: `🐧🌑🐧🔥🦆🦆`  \n  Runs: `🦆` (length 2) → 1 line.  \n\nTotal horizontal lines: \\(2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 9\\).\n\n#### Vertical Lines Analysis\n- **Column 0**: `🦆, 🦆, 🦆, 🔥, 🔥, 🐧`  \n  Runs: `🦆` (length 3), `🔥` (length 2) → 2 lines.  \n- **Column 1**: `🦆, 🦆, 🐧, 🌑, 🦆, 🌑`  \n  Runs: `🦆` (length 2) → 1 line.  \n- **Column 2**: `🦆, 🔥, 🔥, 🦆, 🦆, 🐧`  \n  Runs: `🔥` (length 2), `🦆` (length 2) → 2 lines.  \n- **Column 3**: `🔥, 🦆, 🦆, 🦆, 🐧, 🔥`  \n  Runs: `🦆` (length 3) → 1 line.  \n- **Column 4**: `🔥, 🦆, 🐧, 🌑, 🌑, 🦆`  \n  Runs: `🌑` (length 2) → 1 line.  \n- **Column 5**: `🦆, 🦆, 🐧, 🦆, 🌑, 🦆`  \n  Runs: `🦆` (length 2) → 1 line.  \n\nTotal vertical lines: \\(2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8\\).\n\n### Total Lines\nAdding horizontal and vertical lines gives the final count: \\(9 + 8 = 17\\).\n\nAnswer: 17"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

So, the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines made up of the same emoji, where each line has a length of 2 or more. Hmm. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to look at each row (horizontal) and each column (vertical) in the given board. For each of these, I have to find consecutive sequences of the same emoji that are at least 2 in length. Then, count each such sequence. Oh wait, but wait—what's considered a \"line\" here? Like, if there's a run of 3 same emojis, does that count as one line (length 3) or two lines (length 2 and 3, but overlapping)? The problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So I think each consecutive run of k same emojis (k >=2) contributes (k-1) lines. Because for a run of 2, it's 1 line. For a run of 3, it's 2 lines (positions 0-1, 1-2). For 4, 3 lines, etc. Because each consecutive pair is a line of length 2, and longer lines include those. Or wait, maybe the problem counts a run of length m as (m - 1) lines. Because for example, a run of 2 is 1 line (since 2-1=1), a run of 3 is 2 lines (since 3-1=2). Let me confirm with the example. Suppose a row is \"AA\". Then it's 1 line. If it's \"AAA\", then it's two lines: positions 0-1 and 1-2. So each consecutive pair. Because the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So each line is a consecutive sequence of 2 or more. So a run of m same emojis contributes (m-1) lines. Because a run of 2 has 1 (2-1) line, 3 has 2 (3-1), etc.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each row (horizontal), process each row to find consecutive runs of the same emoji. For each run of length m >=2, add (m-1) to the total.\n\n2. Do the same for each column (vertical). Process each column, find consecutive runs of same emoji, and add (m-1) for each run with m >=2.\n\nNow, let's get the board data. The given board is:\n\nRow 0: 🐐 🌒 🐐 💥 💥 🌒\nRow 1: 🌒 🌒 💥 🐼 🐐 🌒\nRow 2: 💥 🐐 💥 🐼 💥 🐼\nRow 3: 🐼 💥 💥 🐼 💥 🐐\nRow 4: 🐐 🐼 💥 💥 🐼 🐐\nRow 5: 🐐 💥 💥 🌒 🐐 🐼\n\nFirst, let's process the horizontal lines (rows).\n\nLet's go row by row.\n\nRow 0: [🐐, 🌒, 🐐, 💥, 💥, 🌒]\n\nCheck consecutive elements.\n\n- Index 0: 🐐. Next is 🌒 (different). So no run here.\n\n- Index 1: 🌒. Next is 🐐 (different). No.\n\n- Index 2: 🐐. Next is 💥 (different). No.\n\n- Index 3: 💥. Next is 💥 (same). So here's a run of 2 (indices 3-4). Then index 4 is 💥, next is 🌒 (different). So the run length is 2. So (2-1) = 1. So row 0 contributes 1.\n\nRow 0 total: 1.\n\nRow 1: [🌒, 🌒, 💥, 🐼, 🐐, 🌒]\n\nCheck:\n\n- Index 0: 🌒. Next is 🌒 (same). Then index 1: 🌒, next is 💥 (different). So run length 2. (2-1) =1.\n\n- Then index 2: 💥. Next is 🐼 (diff). No.\n\n- Index 3: 🐼. Next is 🐐 (diff). No.\n\n- Index 4: 🐐. Next is 🌒 (diff). No.\n\nSo row 1 contributes 1.\n\nRow 2: [💥, 🐐, 💥, 🐼, 💥, 🐼]\n\nCheck:\n\n- 0: 💥 → 1: 🐐 (diff). No.\n\n- 1: 🐐 → 2: 💥 (diff). No.\n\n- 2: 💥 → 3: 🐼 (diff). No.\n\n- 3: 🐼 → 4: 💥 (diff). No.\n\n- 4: 💥 → 5: 🐼 (diff). No.\n\nNo runs of 2 or more. So row 2 contributes 0.\n\nRow 3: [🐼, 💥, 💥, 🐼, 💥, 🐐]\n\nCheck:\n\n- 0: 🐼 → 1: 💥 (diff). No.\n\n- 1: 💥 → 2: 💥 (same). Then 2: 💥 → 3: 🐼 (diff). So run length 2. (2-1)=1.\n\n- 3: 🐼 → 4: 💥 (diff). No.\n\n- 4: 💥 →5: 🐐 (diff). No.\n\nRow 3 contributes 1.\n\nRow 4: [🐐, 🐼, 💥, 💥, 🐼, 🐐]\n\nCheck:\n\n- 0: 🐐 →1: 🐼 (diff). No.\n\n- 1: 🐼 →2: 💥 (diff). No.\n\n- 2: 💥 →3: 💥 (same). Then 3: 💥 →4: 🐼 (diff). Run length 2. (2-1)=1.\n\n- 4: 🐼 →5: 🐐 (diff). No.\n\nRow 4 contributes 1.\n\nRow 5: [🐐, 💥, 💥, 🌒, 🐐, 🐼]\n\nCheck:\n\n- 0: 🐐 →1: 💥 (diff). No.\n\n- 1: 💥 →2: 💥 (same). Then 2: 💥 →3: 🌒 (diff). Run length 2. (2-1)=1.\n\n- 3: 🌒 →4: 🐐 (diff). No.\n\n- 4: 🐐 →5: 🐼 (diff). No.\n\nRow 5 contributes 1.\n\nSo total horizontal lines: 1 (row0) +1 (row1)+0+1+1+1=5.\n\nNow vertical lines (columns). The board has 6 rows and 6 columns (since each row has 6 elements). So columns 0-5.\n\nLet's process each column.\n\nColumn 0 (index 0 of each row):\n\nRows 0-5: [🐐, 🌒, 💥, 🐼, 🐐, 🐐]\n\nCheck consecutive same:\n\nRow 0: 🐐. Row1: 🌒 (diff). No.\n\nRow1: 🌒. Row2: 💥 (diff). No.\n\nRow2: 💥. Row3: 🐼 (diff). No.\n\nRow3: 🐼. Row4: 🐐 (diff). No.\n\nRow4: 🐐. Row5: 🐐 (same). So run from row4 to row5. Length 2. (2-1)=1. So column 0 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 1 (index 1 of each row):\n\nRows 0-5: [🌒, 🌒, 🐐, 💥, 🐼, 💥]\n\nCheck:\n\nRow0: 🌒. Row1: 🌒 (same). Then row1: 🌒. Row2: 🐐 (diff). Run length 2. (2-1)=1.\n\nRow2: 🐐. Row3: 💥 (diff). No.\n\nRow3: 💥. Row4: 🐼 (diff). No.\n\nRow4: 🐼. Row5: 💥 (diff). No.\n\nSo column 1 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 2 (index 2 of each row):\n\nRows 0-5: [🐐, 💥, 💥, 💥, 💥, 💥]\n\nLet's list the elements:\n\nRow0: 🐐\n\nRow1: 💥\n\nRow2: 💥\n\nRow3: 💥\n\nRow4: 💥\n\nRow5: 💥\n\nCheck consecutive runs:\n\nRow0: 🐐 → row1: 💥 (diff). No.\n\nRow1: 💥 → row2: 💥 (same). Then row2: 💥 → row3: 💥 (same). row3: 💥 → row4: 💥 (same). row4: 💥 → row5: 💥 (same). So the run starts at row1 and ends at row5. How long is this run? From row1 to row5: 5 elements (rows 1,2,3,4,5). So length 5. So (5-1) =4. Because 5 elements in a row, so 4 consecutive pairs. So column 2 contributes 4.\n\nLet me confirm: rows1-5 are all 💥. So that's 5 elements. So 5-1=4 lines. Yes.\n\nColumn 2: 4.\n\nColumn 3 (index 3 of each row):\n\nRows 0-5: [💥, 🐼, 🐼, 🐼, 💥, 🌒]\n\nElements:\n\nRow0: 💥\n\nRow1: 🐼\n\nRow2: 🐼\n\nRow3: 🐼\n\nRow4: 💥\n\nRow5: 🌒\n\nCheck:\n\nRow0: 💥 → row1: 🐼 (diff). No.\n\nRow1: 🐼 → row2: 🐼 (same). row2: 🐼 → row3: 🐼 (same). row3: 🐼 → row4: 💥 (diff). So run from row1 to row3: 3 elements. (3-1)=2.\n\nRow4: 💥 → row5: 🌒 (diff). No.\n\nSo column 3 contributes 2.\n\nColumn 4 (index 4 of each row):\n\nRows 0-5: [💥, 🐐, 💥, 💥, 🐼, 🐐]\n\nElements:\n\nRow0: 💥\n\nRow1: 🐐\n\nRow2: 💥\n\nRow3: 💥\n\nRow4: 🐼\n\nRow5: 🐐\n\nCheck:\n\nRow0: 💥 → row1: 🐐 (diff). No.\n\nRow1: 🐐 → row2: 💥 (diff). No.\n\nRow2: 💥 → row3: 💥 (same). Then row3: 💥 → row4: 🐼 (diff). Run length 2. (2-1)=1.\n\nRow4: 🐼 → row5: 🐐 (diff). No.\n\nSo column 4 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 5 (index 5 of each row):\n\nRows 0-5: [🌒, 🌒, 🐼, 🐐, 🐐, 🐼]\n\nElements:\n\nRow0: 🌒\n\nRow1: 🌒\n\nRow2: 🐼\n\nRow3: 🐐\n\nRow4: 🐐\n\nRow5: 🐼\n\nCheck:\n\nRow0: 🌒 → row1: 🌒 (same). Then row1: 🌒 → row2: 🐼 (diff). Run length 2. (2-1)=1.\n\nRow2: 🐼 → row3: 🐐 (diff). No.\n\nRow3: 🐐 → row4: 🐐 (same). Then row4: 🐐 → row5: 🐼 (diff). Run length 2. (2-1)=1.\n\nSo column 5 contributes 1 +1=2.\n\nLet's summarize the vertical columns:\n\nColumn 0: 1\n\nColumn 1: 1\n\nColumn 2:4\n\nColumn3:2\n\nColumn4:1\n\nColumn5:2\n\nTotal vertical lines: 1+1+4+2+1+2= 11.\n\nNow, total lines (horizontal + vertical) = 5 (horizontal) +11 (vertical) =16.\n\nWait, let's double-check each step to make sure.\n\nHorizontal rows:\n\nRow0: [🐐, 🌒, 🐐, 💥, 💥, 🌒]. The run is 💥 at 3 and 4. So 2 elements. 1 line. Correct.\n\nRow1: [🌒, 🌒, ...]. The first two are 🌒. 1 line. Correct.\n\nRow2: no runs. 0. Correct.\n\nRow3: [🐼, 💥, 💥, ...]. The two 💥s. 1. Correct.\n\nRow4: [ ..., 💥, 💥 ...]. The two 💥s. 1. Correct.\n\nRow5: [ ..., 💥, 💥 ...]. The two 💥s. 1. Correct. 1+1+0+1+1+1=5. Correct.\n\nVertical columns:\n\nColumn 0: elements are 🐐, 🌒, 💥, 🐼, 🐐, 🐐. The last two are 🐐 (row4 and 5). 2 elements. 1 line. Correct.\n\nColumn 1: 🌒, 🌒, 🐐, 💥, 🐼, 💥. First two 🌒. 1 line. Correct.\n\nColumn 2: 🐐, 💥, 💥, 💥, 💥, 💥. The elements from row1 to row5 are all 💥. That's 5 elements. 5-1=4. Correct.\n\nColumn 3: 💥, 🐼, 🐼, 🐼, 💥, 🌒. The three 🐼s (rows1-3). 3 elements. 3-1=2. Correct.\n\nColumn4: 💥, 🐐, 💥, 💥, 🐼, 🐐. The two 💥s (rows2-3). 2 elements. 1 line. Correct.\n\nColumn5: 🌒, 🌒, 🐼, 🐐, 🐐, 🐼. Two runs: first two 🌒 (1 line), and rows3-4 🐐 (1 line). 2 lines. Correct.\n\nSum vertical: 1+1+4+2+1+2=11. Correct.\n\nTotal 5+11=16. So the answer is 16.\n\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more.

So the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines of the same emoji with length 2 or more. Hmm, right. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to check each row for horizontal sequences and each column for vertical sequences. For each possible sequence of length 2 or more, count how many there are. Oh wait, wait. Wait, how does the counting work? Like, if there's a horizontal line of 3 same emojis, how many lines does that contribute? Let's think. For example, in a row like 🌘🌘🌘, the horizontal lines would be positions (0,0)-(0,1), (0,1)-(0,2), and (0,0)-(0,2)? Or is it that a sequence of length L contributes (L-1) lines? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". Oh, perhaps a line is a consecutive sequence of 2 or more same emojis. So a sequence of length 2 is one line, length 3 is one line (since it's a single line of 3), length 4 is one line, etc. Because a line is the entire consecutive same emojis. Oh, wait, maybe not. Let's clarify.\n\nThe problem statement says: \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So each maximal consecutive sequence of same emojis (horizontal or vertical) of length >=2 counts as one line. For example, if in a row we have A A A, that's a horizontal line of length 3, so count 1. If we have A A B B, that's two lines (each of length 2). If we have A A A B B B, that's two lines. But if it's A A B A A, then two separate lines of length 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question counts every possible consecutive pair as a line. Like, a sequence of length L (>=2) has (L-1) possible lines (each pair of consecutive positions). For example, A A A would have 2 lines (positions 0-1 and 1-2). Because 3 elements have 2 consecutive pairs. Then a sequence of length 4 would contribute 3 lines. But the problem statement isn't very clear. Let's read the example again. The user provided an example where the answer is 'e.g. Answer: 192'—but that's just an example. Let's look at the problem statement again.\n\nThe question says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So a line is a consecutive run of 2 or more. So a run of 2 is one line, run of 3 is one line (since it's a single line of 3), etc. Because the line's length is the number of emojis in it. So for a horizontal line, the line is a set of consecutive cells in a row with the same emoji, length >=2. Each such maximal run counts as one.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is that any consecutive sequence of 2 or more (even overlapping) counts. Like, in A A A, positions (0,0)-(0,1) is a line of length 2, (0,1)-(0,2) is another line of length 2, and (0,0)-(0,2) is a line of length 3. So that's 3 lines. But that seems more complicated. The problem statement's wording is ambiguous. However, in programming competition problems, such questions usually consider a \"line\" as a maximal consecutive sequence. Let's check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So, a line is a consecutive sequence (horizontal or vertical) of the same emoji, with length 2 or more. So, each such sequence is counted once, regardless of its length (as long as it's >=2). So a run of 3 same emojis in a row counts as 1 horizontal line. A run of 2 counts as 1. A run of 4 counts as 1, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem counts all possible sub-sequences of length 2 or more. For example, a run of 3 same emojis would have 2 possible sequences of length 2 (positions 0-1, 1-2) and 1 of length 3 (0-2), totaling 3. But the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". The wording suggests that the line's length is 2 or more. So, perhaps a line is a sequence of 2 or more consecutive same emojis. So for a run of L same emojis, the number of lines is (L-1) choose 1? No, that's not. Let's think of a simple example. Let's say a row is [A, A]. Then, that's a horizontal line of length 2. So count 1. If the row is [A, A, A], that's a horizontal line of length 3, so count 1. If the row is [A, A, B, B], then two horizontal lines (each of length 2), count 2. If the row is [A, A, A, B, B, B], then two lines (length 3 and 3), count 2. So that's the first interpretation.\n\nBut another example: [A, A, A]. If the line is any consecutive 2 or more, then the possible lines are positions 0-1 (length 2), 1-2 (length 2), 0-2 (length 3). So 3 lines. But that's a different count.\n\nWhich interpretation is correct? The problem statement is ambiguous, but perhaps the first one (maximal runs) is intended. Let's see. Let's look for possible test cases.\n\nSuppose a row with [A, A, A]. How many lines? If the answer is 1, then the first approach. If 3, the second.\n\nBut perhaps the problem's intended meaning is to count each maximal consecutive run (i.e., the longest possible) of length >=2. Because otherwise, the count would be higher, and the example given (e.g., 192) could be possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem counts each possible consecutive pair. For example, in a run of L same emojis, there are (L-1) lines of length 2, (L-2) lines of length 3, ..., 1 line of length L. So total lines for that run is sum_{k=2 to L} (L - k + 1) ) = sum_{i=1 to L-1} i } - sum_{i=1 to 1} i} (since for k=2, i = L-2+1= L-1? No, perhaps I should compute sum from k=2 to L of (L - k + 1). Let's compute for L=2: k=2 → 2-2+1=1 → sum 1. L=3: k=2 → 3-2+1=2; k=3 →3-3+1=1 → sum 3. L=4: k=2 →3, k=3→2, k=4→1 → sum 6. So sum for L is (L-1)*L\/2 - (1*2\/2) → (L(L-1)\/2) - 1. No, for L=2, sum 1 → (2*1\/2) =1. L=3 sum 3 → (3*2\/2)=3. Oh, right. Because sum_{k=2 to L} (L -k +1) = sum_{m=1 to L-1} m} (since when k=2, m= L-2+1= L-1; when k=3, m= L-3+1= L-2; ... k=L → m=1). So sum from m=1 to L-1 of m is (L-1)*L\/2. So for L=2, 1. L=3, 3. L=4, 6. So that's the sum. So a run of length L contributes (L*(L-1))\/2 lines. Because each possible consecutive sub-sequence of length >=2. For example, L=2: 1 line (the pair). L=3: 3 lines (positions 0-1, 1-2, 0-2). L=4: 6 lines (0-1,1-2,2-3, 0-2,1-3, 0-3). That's 6 lines.\n\nBut which interpretation is correct? The problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Let's read the problem statement again. The question says \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So, a line is a consecutive sequence of 2 or more same emojis. So each such sequence (of any length >=2) is a line. So, for a horizontal line of 3 same emojis, the lines are:\n\n- positions (row, col) to (row, col+1) → length 2.\n\n- positions (row, col+1) to (row, col+2) → length 2.\n\n- positions (row, col) to (row, col+2) → length 3.\n\nSo three lines. So each possible consecutive sub-sequence of length >=2. So the count is (L*(L-1))\/2 for a run of length L. Because (L-1) + (L-2) + ... + 1 = L*(L-1)\/2.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because each line is a consecutive sequence of 2 or more. So a run of L same emojis has (L choose 2) possible lines. Because the number of possible pairs of start and end positions where end - start +1 >=2. So the number is sum_{k=2 to L} (L -k +1) ) = (L-1)*L\/2.\n\nSo, for example, if a row has [A, A], then (2*1)\/2=1 line. [A, A, A] → 3 lines. [A, A, B, B] → 1 (from A's) +1 (from B's) → 2 lines. Because each A's run is length 2 (1 line), B's run is length 2 (1 line). So 1+1=2.\n\nIf that's the case, then the approach is:\n\nFor each row, check consecutive runs of the same emoji. For each run of length L >=2, add (L*(L-1))\/2 to the total.\n\nDo the same for each column.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Iterate over each row in the board.\n\n   For each row:\n\n   - Traverse the row, track current emoji and current run length.\n\n   - When the emoji changes, if the previous run length was >=2, compute (L*(L-1))\/2 and add to total.\n\n   - Also, after the row ends, check if the last run has length >=2.\n\n2. Do the same for each column:\n\n   For each column index c:\n\n   - Traverse each row r from 0 to 6 (since the board is 7x7? Let's check the input.)\n\nThe input board has 7 rows. Let's check:\n\nRow 0: 🌘🦭🦭🦎🦏🌘🦭 → 7 elements.\n\nRow 1: 🌘💧🦏🌘🌘🦏🐳 → 7.\n\nRow 2: 🐳💧💧🦭🐳🦎⛅️ →7.\n\nRow 3: 💧🌘🦭🌘🦏🐳💧 →7.\n\nRow 4: 🦎⛅️🐳🦭💧🌘🦎 →7.\n\nRow 5: ⛅️🦎💧🌘💧🦭⛅️ →7.\n\nRow 6: 🦏🐳⛅️⛅️⛅️💧🌘 →7.\n\nSo it's a 7x7 grid (rows 0-6, columns 0-6).\n\nSo columns are 0-6. For each column c (0-6), we look at the 7 cells (r, c) for r from 0 to 6.\n\nFor each column:\n\n   - Traverse the column, track current emoji and current run length.\n\n   - When the emoji changes, if the previous run length was >=2, compute (L*(L-1))\/2 and add to total.\n\n   - After the column ends, check the last run.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute horizontal lines (all rows) and vertical lines (all columns), sum them all.\n\nLet's start with the horizontal lines first.\n\nLet's process each row:\n\nRow 0: 🌘🦭🦭🦎🦏🌘🦭 → elements: [0:🌘, 1:🦭, 2:🦭, 3:🦎, 4:🦏, 5:🌘, 6:🦭]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- 🌘 (pos 0): run length 1. Next is 🦭 (pos1), so run ends. Length 1 <2: no contribution.\n\n- 🦭 (pos1-2): run from 1 to 2. Length 2. So (2*1)\/2=1. Add 1.\n\n- Then pos3: 🦎. Run length 1. Next pos4: 🦏. So run ends, 1 <2: no.\n\n- pos4: 🦏, next pos5:🌘. Run length 1: no.\n\n- pos5: 🌘, next pos6:🦭. Run length 1: no.\n\n- pos6: 🦭, end of row. Run length 1: no.\n\nSo row 0 horizontal contributes 1.\n\nRow 1: 🌘💧🦏🌘🌘🦏🐳 → [0:🌘, 1:💧, 2:🦏, 3:🌘, 4:🌘, 5:🦏, 6:🐳]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- 🌘 (pos0). Next is 💧. Run length 1: no.\n\n- 💧 (pos1). Next is 🦏.

Run length 1: no.\n\nRow 2 horizontal contributes 1.\n\nRow 3: 💧🌘🦭🌘🦏🐳💧 → [0:💧,1:🌘,2:🦭,3:🌘,4:🦏,5:🐳,6:💧]\n\nRuns:\n\nEach element is different from the next. All runs length 1. So 0.\n\nRow 3 horizontal contributes 0.\n\nRow 4: 🦎⛅️🐳🦭💧🌘🦎 → [0:🦎,1:⛅️,2:🐳,3:🦭,4:💧,5:🌘,6:🦎]\n\nAll elements are different. All runs length 1. 0.\n\nRow 4 horizontal contributes 0.\n\nRow 5: ⛅️🦎💧🌘💧🦭⛅️ → [0:⛅️,1:🦎,2:💧,3:🌘,4:💧,5:🦭,6:⛅️]\n\nEach element different from next. Runs length 1. 0.\n\nRow 5 horizontal contributes 0.\n\nRow 6: 🦏🐳⛅️⛅️⛅️💧🌘 → [0:🦏,1:🐳,2:⛅️,3:⛅️,4:⛅️,5:💧,6:🌘]\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🦏 (pos0). Next is 🐳: run length 1: no.\n\n- 🐳 (pos1). Next is ⛅️: run length 1: no.\n\n- ⛅️ (pos2-4). Run length 3. (3*2)\/2=3. Add 3.\n\n- 💧 (pos5). Next is 🌘: run length 1: no.\n\n- 🌘 (pos6): run length 1: no.\n\nSo row 6 horizontal contributes 3.\n\nTotal horizontal lines so far: 1 (row0) +1 (row1) +1 (row2) +0 +0 +0 +3 (row6) = 6.\n\nNow let's process vertical lines (columns 0-6).\n\nEach column is 7 elements (rows 0-6).\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow 0: 🌘\n\nRow 1: 🌘\n\nRow 2: 🐳\n\nRow 3: 💧\n\nRow 4: 🦎\n\nRow 5: ⛅️\n\nRow 6: 🦏\n\nSo elements: [🌘, 🌘, 🐳, 💧, 🦎, ⛅️, 🦏]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- 🌘 (rows 0-1).

So row 0 contributes 1. Correct.\n\nRow 1: [🌘, 💧, 🦏, 🌘, 🌘, 🦏, 🐳]\n\nRuns: 🌘 (1), 💧 (1), 🦏 (1), 🌘 (3-4: length 2 → 1), 🦏 (1), 🐳 (1). So 1. Correct.\n\nRow 2: [🐳, 💧, 💧, 🦭, 🐳, 🦎, ⛅️]\n\nRuns: 🐳 (1), 💧 (1-2: 2 → 1), 🦭 (1), 🐳 (1), 🦎 (1), ⛅️ (1). 1. Correct.\n\nRow 3: all unique. 0.\n\nRow 4: all unique. 0.\n\nRow 5: all unique. 0.\n\nRow 6: [🦏, 🐳, ⛅️, ⛅️, ⛅️, 💧, 🌘]\n\nRuns: 🦏 (1), 🐳 (1), ⛅️ (2-4: length 3 → (3*2)\/2=3), 💧 (1), 🌘 (1). So 3. Correct.\n\nTotal horizontal: 1+1+1+0+0+0+3=6. Correct.\n\nVertical columns:\n\nColumn 0: [🌘, 🌘, 🐳, 💧, 🦎, ⛅️, 🦏]\n\nRuns: 🌘 (0-1: length 2 → 1). Correct. 1.\n\nColumn 1: [🦭, 💧, 💧, 🌘, ⛅️, 🦎, 🐳]\n\nRuns: 💧 (1-2: length 2 →1). Correct. 1.\n\nColumn 2: [🦭, 🦏, 💧, 🦭, 🐳, 💧, ⛅️]. All unique. 0.\n\nColumn 3: [🦎, 🌘, 🦭, 🌘, 🦭, 🌘, ⛅️]. All unique. 0.\n\nColumn 4: [🦏, 🦏, 🐳, 🦏, 💧, 💧, ⛅️].\n\nRuns: 🦏 (0-1: length 2 →1). Then, later, 💧 (4-5: length 2 →1). So 1+1=2. Correct.\n\nColumn 5: [🌘, 🦏, 🦎, 🐳, 🌘, 🦭, 💧]. All unique. 0.\n\nColumn 6: [🦭, 🐳, ⛅️, 💧, 🦎, ⛅️, 🌘]. All unique. 0.\n\nVertical total: 1+1+2=4. Correct.\n\nTotal lines: 6+4=10.\n\nWait, but let's check if I made any mistake in column 4.\n\nColumn 4 elements:\n\nRow0: 🦏 (from row 0, column4: the 5th element (index 4) of row0 is 🦏. Let's confirm row0: 🌘🦭🦭🦎🦏🌘🦭 → indexes 0-6. So column 4 is row0[4] = 🦏. Correct.\n\nRow1: row1 is 🌘💧🦏🌘🌘🦏🐳 → row1[4] is 🌘? No, row1's elements:\n\nrow1: 0:🌘, 1:💧, 2:🦏, 3:🌘, 4:🌘, 5:🦏, 6:🐳. So row1[4] is 🌘? Oh wait, I think I made a mistake in column 4. Let's recheck column 4.\n\nColumn 4 is the 5th column (since columns are 0-6). So column 4 is the elements (r,4) for r=0 to 6.\n\nRow0: [0:🌘,1:🦭,2:🦭,3:🦎,4:🦏,5:🌘,6:🦭] → row0[4] = 🦏. Correct.\n\nRow1: [0:🌘,1:💧,2:🦏,3:🌘,4:🌘,5:🦏,6:🐳] → row1[4] = 🌘. Oh! Oh no, I made a mistake here. So row1[4] is 🌘, not 🦏. So my previous analysis of column4 is wrong. Oh no. Let's redo column4.\n\nColumn 4 (c=4):\n\nRow0: row0[4] = 🦏.\n\nRow1: row1[4] = 🌘.\n\nRow2: row2[4] = 🐳. (Row2: 🐳💧💧🦭🐳🦎⛅️ → indexes 0:🐳, 1:💧, 2:💧, 3:🦭, 4:🐳, 5:🦎, 6:⛅️ → row2[4] = 🐳.)\n\nRow3: row3[4] = 🦏. (Row3: 💧🌘🦭🌘🦏🐳💧 → indexes 0:💧, 1:🌘, 2:🦭, 3:🌘, 4:🦏, 5:🐳, 6:💧 → row3[4] = 🦏.)\n\nRow4: row4[4] = 💧. (Row4: 🦎⛅️🐳🦭💧🌘🦎 → indexes 0:🦎, 1:⛅️, 2:🐳, 3:🦭, 4:💧, 5:🌘, 6:🦎 → row4[4] = 💧.)\n\nRow5: row5[4] = 💧. (Row5: ⛅️🦎💧🌘💧🦭⛅️ → indexes 0:⛅️, 1:🦎, 2:💧, 3:🌘, 4:💧, 5:🦭, 6:⛅️ → row5[4] = 💧.)\n\nRow6: row6[4] = ⛅️. (Row6: 🦏🐳⛅️⛅️⛅️💧🌘 → indexes 0:🦏, 1:🐳, 2:⛅️, 3:⛅️, 4:⛅️, 5:💧, 6:🌘 → row6[4] = ⛅️.)\n\nSo column 4 elements are: [🦏, 🌘, 🐳, 🦏, 💧, 💧, ⛅️].\n\nSo the elements in column 4 (r=0 to 6) are:\n\nr0: 🦏\n\nr1: 🌘\n\nr2: 🐳\n\nr3: 🦏\n\nr4: 💧\n\nr5: 💧\n\nr6: ⛅️\n\nSo the runs here:\n\n- 🦏 (r0). Next r1: 🌘 → run length 1. No contribution.\n\n- 🌘 (r1). Next r2: 🐳 → run length 1. No.\n\n- 🐳 (r2). Next r3: 🦏 → run length 1. No.\n\n- 🦏 (r3). Next r4: 💧 → run length 1. No.\n\n- 💧 (r4-5). Run length 2 → (2*1)\/2=1. Add 1.\n\n- ⛅️ (r6). Run length 1: no.\n\nSo column 4 contributes 1. Oh, I made a mistake earlier. Because row1[4] is 🌘, not 🦏. So column 4's elements are different than I thought. So my previous calculation of column 4's contribution was wrong.\n\nLet's recheck all columns again carefully.\n\nLet's list all columns properly:\n\nEach column c (0-6) has elements [row0[c], row1[c], row2[c], row3[c], row4[c], row5[c], row6[c]].\n\nLet's list each column:\n\nColumn 0 (c=0):\n\nrow0[0] = 🌘\n\nrow1[0] = 🌘\n\nrow2[0] = 🐳\n\nrow3[0] = 💧\n\nrow4[0] = 🦎\n\nrow5[0] = ⛅️\n\nrow6[0] = 🦏\n\nSo column0 elements: [🌘, 🌘, 🐳, 💧, 🦎, ⛅️, 🦏]\n\nRuns: 🌘 (r0-r1: length 2 → 1). Correct.\n\nColumn 1 (c=1):\n\nrow0[1] = 🦭\n\nrow1[1] = 💧\n\nrow2[1] = 💧\n\nrow3[1] = 🌘\n\nrow4[1] = ⛅️\n\nrow5[1] = 🦎\n\nrow6[1] = 🐳\n\nElements: [🦭, 💧, 💧, 🌘, ⛅️, 🦎, 🐳]\n\nRuns: 💧 (r1-r2: length 2 →1). Correct.\n\nColumn 2 (c=2):\n\nrow0[2] = 🦭\n\nrow1[2] = 🦏\n\nrow2[2] = 💧\n\nrow3[2] = 🦭\n\nrow4[2] = 🐳\n\nrow5[2] = 💧\n\nrow6[2] = ⛅️\n\nElements: [🦭, 🦏, 💧, 🦭, 🐳, 💧, ⛅️]\n\nRuns: all length 1. 0.\n\nColumn 3 (c=3):\n\nrow0[3] = 🦎\n\nrow1[3] = 🌘\n\nrow2[3] = 🦭\n\nrow3[3] = 🌘\n\nrow4[3] = 🦭\n\nrow5[3] = 🌘\n\nrow6[3] = ⛅️\n\nElements: [🦎, 🌘, 🦭, 🌘, 🦭, 🌘, ⛅️]\n\nRuns: all length 1. 0.\n\nColumn 4 (c=4):\n\nrow0[4] = 🦏\n\nrow1[4] = 🌘 (row1: [0:🌘, 1:💧, 2:🦏, 3:🌘, 4:🌘, 5:🦏, 6:🐳] → index4 is 🌘)\n\nrow2[4] = 🐳 (row2: [0:🐳, 1:💧, 2:💧, 3:🦭, 4:🐳, 5:🦎, 6:⛅️] → index4 is 🐳)\n\nrow3[4] = 🦏 (row3: [0:💧, 1:🌘, 2:🦭, 3:🌘, 4:🦏, 5:🐳, 6:💧] → index4 is 🦏)\n\nrow4[4] = 💧 (row4: [0:🦎, 1:⛅️, 2:🐳, 3:🦭, 4:💧, 5:🌘, 6:🦎] → index4 is 💧)\n\nrow5[4] = 💧 (row5: [0:⛅️, 1:🦎, 2:💧, 3:🌘, 4:💧, 5:🦭, 6:⛅️] → index4 is 💧)\n\nrow6[4] = ⛅️ (row6: [0:🦏, 1:🐳, 2:⛅️, 3:⛅️, 4:⛅️, 5:💧, 6:🌘] → index4 is ⛅️)\n\nSo elements: [🦏, 🌘, 🐳, 🦏, 💧, 💧, ⛅️]\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🦏 (r0). Next r1: 🌘 → length 1.\n\n- 🌘 (r1). Next r2: 🐳 → length 1.\n\n- 🐳 (r2). Next r3: 🦏 → length 1.\n\n- 🦏 (r3). Next r4: 💧 → length 1.\n\n- 💧 (r4-r5). Length 2 → (2*1)\/2=1. Add 1.\n\n- ⛅️ (r6). Length 1.\n\nSo column4 contributes 1.\n\nColumn5 (c=5):\n\nrow0[5] = 🌘\n\nrow1[5] = 🦏\n\nrow2[5] = 🦎\n\nrow3[5] = 🐳\n\nrow4[5] = 🌘\n\nrow5[5] = 🦭\n\nrow6[5] = 💧\n\nElements: [🌘, 🦏, 🦎, 🐳, 🌘, 🦭, 💧]\n\nAll runs length 1. 0.\n\nColumn6 (c=6):\n\nrow0[6] = 🦭\n\nrow1[6] = 🐳\n\nrow2[6] = ⛅️\n\nrow3[6] = 💧\n\nrow4[6] = 🦎\n\nrow5[6] = ⛅️\n\nrow6[6] = 🌘\n\nElements: [🦭, 🐳, ⛅️, 💧, 🦎, ⛅️, 🌘]\n\nRuns:\n\n- ⛅️ (r2 and r5? No. r2: ⛅️, r3:💧, r4:🦎, r5:⛅️. So r2 is ⛅️, next is r3:💧 → length 1. r5:⛅️, next r6:🌘 → length 1. So no runs of >=2. So 0.\n\nSo column6 contributes 0.\n\nSo vertical contributions:\n\ncolumn0:1, column1:1, column2:0, column3:0, column4:1, column5:0, column6:0 → total 1+1+1=3.\n\nSo vertical total is 3.\n\nHorizontal total was 6. So total lines 6+3=9.\n\nWait, but let's recheck column 4. Oh, in column4, the run of 💧 is in rows4 and 5. So r4:💧, r5:💧. So that's a run of 2. So (2*1)\/2=1. Correct.\n\nNow, let's check if there are any other columns I missed.\n\nColumn 0: 🌘, 🌘 → run of 2 → 1. Correct.\n\nColumn1: 💧, 💧 → run of 2 →1. Correct.\n\nColumn4: 💧, 💧 → run of 2 →1. Correct.\n\nSo vertical sum 3.\n\nHorizontal sum 6.\n\nTotal 9.\n\nBut wait, let's recheck row 6.\n\nRow6: 🦏🐳⛅️⛅️⛅️💧🌘 → elements: [🦏, 🐳, ⛅️, ⛅️, ⛅️, 💧, 🌘].\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🦏 (1), 🐳 (1), ⛅️ (r2-4: 3 elements). So run length 3. (3*2)\/2=3. Correct. So row6 contributes 3. So row6 is correct.\n\nSo horizontal sum is 1 (row0) +1 (row1) +1 (row2) +0 (row3) +0 (row4) +0 (row5) +3 (row6) → 6. Correct.\n\nVertical sum 3.\n\nTotal 9.\n\nBut let's check other possible mistakes.\n\nLet's check row 2 again.\n\nRow2: 🐳💧💧🦭🐳🦎⛅️ → elements [🐳, 💧, 💧, 🦭, 🐳, 🦎, ⛅️].\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🐳 (1).\n\n- 💧 (positions 1-2 → length 2. (2*1)\/2=1. Correct.\n\n- 🦭 (1), 🐳 (1), 🦎 (1), ⛅️ (1). So row2 contributes 1. Correct.\n\nRow1: 🌘💧🦏🌘🌘🦏🐳 → elements [🌘, 💧, 🦏, 🌘, 🌘, 🦏, 🐳].\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🌘 (1), 💧 (1), 🦏 (1), 🌘 (positions 3-4: length 2 → 1. Correct. So row1 contributes 1.\n\nRow0: 🌘🦭🦭🦎🦏🌘🦭 → elements [🌘, 🦭, 🦭, 🦎, 🦏, 🌘, 🦭].\n\nRuns: 🦭 (positions 1-2 → length 2 →1. Correct.\n\nSo horizontal sum 6.\n\nVertical sum 3. 6+3=9.\n\nIs there any other line I missed?\n\nLet's check column 3 again. Column3 elements:\n\nrow0[3] = 🦎 (row0: 0:🌘,1:🦭,2:🦭,3:🦎, ... → correct).\n\nrow1[3] = 🌘 (row1: 3:🌘 → correct).\n\nrow2[3] = 🦭 (row2: 3:🦭 → correct).\n\nrow3[3] = 🌘 (row3: 3:🌘 → correct).\n\nrow4[3] = 🦭 (row4: 3:🦭 → correct).\n\nrow5[3] = 🌘 (row5: 3:🌘 → correct).\n\nrow6[3] = ⛅️ (row6: 3:⛅️ → correct).\n\nElements: [🦎, 🌘, 🦭, 🌘, 🦭, 🌘, ⛅️].\n\nNo runs of 2. Correct.\n\nAnother column: column 5.\n\nrow0[5] = 🌘 (row0: 5:🌘 → correct).\n\nrow1[5] = 🦏 (row1:5:🦏 → correct).\n\nrow2[5] = 🦎 (row2:5:🦎 → correct).\n\nrow3[5] = 🐳 (row3:5:🐳 → correct).\n\nrow4[5] = 🌘 (row4:5:🌘 → correct).\n\nrow5[5] = 🦭 (row5:5:🦭 → correct).\n\nrow6[5] = 💧 (row6:5:💧 → correct).\n\nElements: [🌘, 🦏, 🦎, 🐳, 🌘, 🦭, 💧]. No runs. Correct.\n\nColumn 6:\n\nrow0[6] = 🦭 (correct).\n\nrow1[6] = 🐳 (correct).\n\nrow2[6] = ⛅️ (correct).\n\nrow3[6] = 💧 (correct).\n\nrow4[6] = 🦎 (correct).\n\nrow5[6] = ⛅️ (correct).\n\nrow6[6] = 🌘 (correct).\n\nElements: [🦭, 🐳, ⛅️, 💧, 🦎, ⛅️, 🌘]. The ⛅️ are at r2 and r5, which are not consecutive. So no runs. Correct.\n\nSo vertical sum 3.\n\nTotal 9.\n\nIs there any other line I missed?\n\nLet's check row 6 again. The row is 🦏🐳⛅️⛅️⛅️💧🌘. The ⛅️ are in positions 2,3,4. So a run of 3. So (3*2)\/2=3. Correct. So 3 lines from this run.\n\nYes.\n\nSo total 9.\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, where each line has a length of 2 or more. A line is defined as a consecutive sequence of the same emoji with a length of at least 2. For a sequence of length \\( L \\), the number of such lines is given by \\( \\frac{L \\times (L-1)}{2} \\), which accounts for all possible sub-sequences of length 2 or more within the sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Horizontal Lines**: For each row in the board, identify consecutive sequences of the same emoji. For each sequence of length \\( L \\geq 2 \\), add \\( \\frac{L \\times (L-1)}{2} \\) to the total count.\n2. **Vertical Lines**: For each column in the board, similarly identify consecutive sequences of the same emoji.

So, the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines made up of the same emoji, with length 2 or more. Hmm. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to look at each row (horizontal) and each column (vertical) of the board. For each row, check consecutive emojis of the same type. Similarly for columns. Then, count all such sequences where the length is at least 2. But wait, how exactly do we count these sequences? Like, for a row like \"A A A\", that's a horizontal line of length 3. How many lines does that count as? Let's think. If the line is of length n (n ≥2), the number of possible consecutive pairs (or longer) is (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1? No, wait, maybe the problem is that each such consecutive run of k same emojis contributes (k-1) lines. Because, for example, a run of 2 same emojis (like \"AA\") is 1 line. A run of 3 (\"AAA\") has two lines: positions 1-2 and 2-3. Or maybe the problem counts the entire run as one line if it's length ≥2. Oh wait, the question says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So a single line of length 2 is one, a line of length 3 is one (since it's a single line of 3, which is longer than 2). Or wait, maybe I need to count each maximal consecutive sequence of same emojis (length ≥2) as one. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe problem statement says: \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So, a line here is a consecutive sequence of the same emoji of length ≥2. So, for a row like \"A A A\", that's one horizontal line of length 3, which is ≥2. For a row like \"A A B B B A\", that's two horizontal lines: the first two A's (length 2) and the next three B's (length 3). So each maximal consecutive run of same emojis of length ≥2 counts as one.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem counts every possible consecutive segment of length 2 or more. For example, \"AAA\" would have two segments of length 2 (positions 0-1 and 1-2) and one of length 3 (0-2). So total 3. But that's possible. The problem's wording is a bit ambiguous. Let's check the example given. The user says \"e.g. Answer: 192\", but no example input. So we need to clarify.\n\nThe question says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So perhaps a \"line\" is a consecutive sequence (horizontal or vertical) of the same emoji where the length is 2 or more. So each such maximal run counts as one line. For example, a run of 3 same emojis is one line (length 3). A run of 2 is one line (length 2). Because the line is the entire consecutive sequence. So \"AAA\" is one line (length 3), \"AABBB\" has two lines (A's of length 2, B's of length 3).\n\nAlternatively, maybe any consecutive sequence of length ≥2, regardless of being part of a longer sequence. For example, \"AAA\" has two possible lines of length 2 (positions 0-1, 1-2) and one line of length 3 (0-2). So 3 lines. But that's a different approach. Which is correct?\n\nLet's think. The problem says \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". The term \"lines\" here is a bit ambiguous. Let's look at the problem's example. Suppose a board like:\n\nRow 0: A A A\nRow 1: B B\n\nThen, the horizontal lines would be:\n\nRow 0 has a horizontal line of 3 A's (counts as 1). Row 1 has a horizontal line of 2 B's (counts as 1). So total 2.\n\nIf the approach is to count each maximal run (≥2) as 1, then 2.\n\nAlternatively, if it's all possible consecutive sequences of length ≥2, then for row 0:\n\nA A (positions 0-1), A A (positions 1-2), A A A (positions 0-2). So 3. Row 1: B B (positions 0-1) → 1. Total 4.\n\nWhich approach is correct?\n\nThe problem statement's wording says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So perhaps \"line\" here refers to a contiguous segment of the same emoji, with length ≥2, and each such segment is counted once. So the first approach (maximal runs) is correct. Because a line is a single continuous segment. For example, a horizontal line of 3 same emojis is one line, not multiple.\n\nSo let's proceed with that. So for each row, we need to find all the maximal consecutive runs of the same emoji with length ≥2, and count each as 1. Do the same for each column. Then sum all those counts.\n\nLet's confirm with a small example. Suppose a row is \"AAABBB\". Then the horizontal lines are the run of 3 A's (count 1) and the run of 3 B's (count 1) → total 2.\n\nAnother example: \"AABBA\". The runs are AA (length 2), BB (length 2) → 2 lines.\n\nAnother example: \"ABBBBC\". The run of 4 B's (length 4) → 1 line.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each row in the board, scan left to right, find all consecutive runs of same emojis, check if length ≥2. For each such run, increment the count by 1.\n\n2. For each column in the board, scan top to bottom, find all consecutive runs of same emojis, check if length ≥2. For each such run, increment the count by 1.\n\n3. Sum all these counts.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given board.\n\nFirst, let's write down the board. The input is:\n\nRow 0: 🌻😁🐧😁😁\nRow 1: 😁🐧😁🐧😁\nRow 2: 😁🐧😁🐧😁\nRow 3: 😁😁🐧🐧🌻\nRow 4: 🐧🌻😁🐧😁\n\nLet's index rows 0-4, columns 0-4 (since each row has 5 elements).\n\nLet's process horizontal lines first (rows).\n\nProcessing each row:\n\nRow 0: 🌻 😁 🐧 😁 😁\n\nLet's list the emojis: [🌻, 😁, 🐧, 😁, 😁]\n\nCheck consecutive runs:\n\n- 🌻: length 1 (no)\n- 😁: length 1 (no)\n- 🐧: length 1 (no)\n- 😁: length 2 (positions 3 and 4). So run of 2 → count 1.\n\nSo row 0 contributes 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow 1: 😁 🐧 😁 🐧 😁\n\nEmojis: [😁, 🐧, 😁, 🐧, 😁]\n\nCheck runs:\n\nEach emoji is single. So all runs are length 1. No lines here. So row 1 contributes 0.\n\nRow 2: 😁 🐧 😁 🐧 😁 → same as row 1. All runs of 1. So 0.\n\nRow 3: 😁 😁 🐧 🐧 🌻\n\nEmojis: [😁, 😁, 🐧, 🐧, 🌻]\n\nRuns:\n\n- 😁: length 2 (positions 0-1) → count 1.\n- 🐧: length 2 (positions 2-3) → count 1.\nSo row 3 contributes 2.\n\nRow 4: 🐧 🌻 😁 🐧 😁\n\nEmojis: [🐧, 🌻, 😁, 🐧, 😁]\n\nAll runs are length 1. So 0.\n\nSo horizontal lines total: 1 (row0) + 0 (row1) + 0 (row2) + 2 (row3) + 0 (row4) = 3.\n\nNow vertical lines (columns). There are 5 columns (0-4).\n\nLet's process each column.\n\nColumn 0 (rows 0-4):\n\nRow 0: 🌻\nRow 1: 😁\nRow 2: 😁\nRow 3: 😁\nRow 4: 🐧\n\nSo the column is [🌻, 😁, 😁, 😁, 🐧]\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- 🌻: length 1 → no.\n- 😁: from row1 to row3 (rows 1,2,3). So positions 1,2,3: 3 elements. Length 3 → count 1.\n- 🐧: length 1 → no.\n\nSo column 0 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 1 (rows 0-4):\n\nRow0: 😁\nRow1: 🐧\nRow2: 🐧\nRow3: 😁\nRow4: 🌻\n\nColumn: [😁, 🐧, 🐧, 😁, 🌻]\n\nRuns:\n\n- 😁: length 1 → no.\n- 🐧: rows1-2 → length 2 → count 1.\n- 😁: length 1 → no.\n- 🌻: length 1 → no.\n\nSo column 1 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 2 (rows 0-4):\n\nRow0: 🐧\nRow1: 😁\nRow2: 😁\nRow3: 🐧\nRow4: 😁\n\nColumn: [🐧, 😁, 😁, 🐧, 😁]\n\nRuns:\n\n- 🐧: length 1 → no.\n- 😁: rows1-2 → length 2 → count 1.\n- 🐧: length 1 → no.\n- 😁: length 1 → no.\n\nSo column 2 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 3 (rows 0-4):\n\nRow0: 😁\nRow1: 🐧\nRow2: 🐧\nRow3: 🐧\nRow4: 🐧\n\nColumn: [😁, 🐧, 🐧, 🐧, 🐧]\n\nRuns:\n\n- 😁: length 1 → no.\n- 🐧: rows1-4 → 4 elements (rows1,2,3,4). Length 4 → count 1.\n\nSo column 3 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 4 (rows 0-4):\n\nRow0: 😁\nRow1: 😁\nRow2: 😁\nRow3: 🌻\nRow4: 😁\n\nColumn: [😁, 😁, 😁, 🌻, 😁]\n\nRuns:\n\n- 😁: rows0-2 → 3 elements (rows0,1,2). Length 3 → count 1.\n- 🌻: length 1 → no.\n- 😁: length 1 → no.\n\nSo column 4 contributes 1.\n\nSo vertical lines total: 1 (col0) +1 (col1) +1 (col2) +1 (col3) +1 (col4) =5.\n\nWait, let's recheck each column.\n\nColumn 0: [🌻, 😁, 😁, 😁, 🐧]. The run of 😁 starts at row1 (index 1) and ends at row3 (index 3). So positions 1,2,3. So length 3. So yes, that's a run of 3, which is ≥2. So 1.\n\nColumn 1: [😁, 🐧, 🐧, 😁, 🌻]. The run of 🐧 is at rows1 and 2 (indices 1 and 2). Length 2. So 1.\n\nColumn 2: [🐧, 😁, 😁, 🐧, 😁]. The run of 😁 is rows1 and 2 (indices 1 and 2). Length 2. So 1.\n\nColumn 3: [😁, 🐧, 🐧, 🐧, 🐧]. The run of 🐧 starts at row1 (index 1) and ends at row4 (index 4). That's 4 elements (indices 1,2,3,4). Length 4. So 1.\n\nColumn 4: [😁, 😁, 😁, 🌻, 😁]. The run of 😁 is rows0,1,2 (indices 0,1,2). Length 3. So 1.\n\nSo vertical lines sum to 5.\n\nNow, total lines (horizontal + vertical) = 3 +5=8?\n\nWait, but let's double-check the horizontal lines again.\n\nRow 0: [🌻, 😁, 🐧, 😁, 😁]. The last two 😁s: positions 3 and 4 (indices 3 and 4). So that's a run of 2. So 1.\n\nRow 3: [😁, 😁, 🐧, 🐧, 🌻]. The first two 😁s (indices 0,1) → run of 2 → 1. Then the next two 🐧s (indices 2,3) → run of 2 → 1. So 2.\n\nRow 0 contributes 1, row3 contributes 2. Rows 1,2,4 contribute 0. So 1+2=3. Correct.\n\nVertical lines 5. 3+5=8. So the answer would be 8?\n\nWait, let's check again. Let's make sure I didn't miss any runs.\n\nAnother check for horizontal:\n\nRow 0: 🌻, 😁, 🐧, 😁, 😁. The runs are:\n\n🌻 (1), 😁 (1), 🐧 (1), 😁 (2). So 1.\n\nRow 1: 😁, 🐧, 😁, 🐧, 😁. All runs of 1. So 0.\n\nRow 2: same as row1. 0.\n\nRow 3: 😁, 😁 (2), 🐧, 🐧 (2), 🌻 (1). So 2.\n\nRow 4: 🐧 (1), 🌻 (1), 😁 (1), 🐧 (1), 😁 (1). 0.\n\nSo horizontal 3.\n\nVertical:\n\nColumn 0: 🌻 (1), 😁 (3), 🐧 (1). So 1 run (😁 of length 3).\n\nColumn 1: 😁 (1), 🐧 (2), 😁 (1), 🌻 (1). So 1 run (🐧 of length 2).\n\nColumn 2: 🐧 (1), 😁 (2), 🐧 (1), 😁 (1). So 1 run (😁 of length 2).\n\nColumn 3: 😁 (1), 🐧 (4). So 1 run (🐧 of length 4).\n\nColumn 4: 😁 (3), 🌻 (1), 😁 (1). So 1 run (😁 of length 3).\n\nSo 1+1+1+1+1=5.\n\n3+5=8. So the answer is 8.\n\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, where each line has a length of 2 or more. A \"line\" is defined as a consecutive sequence of the same emoji with a length of at least 2. We will check each row (horizontal) and each column (vertical) for such lines.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Horizontal Lines**: For each row, scan left to right to identify consecutive runs of the same emoji.

So, the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines of the same emoji with length 2 or more. Hmm. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to process each row (horizontal) and each column (vertical) of the board. For each row, check consecutive emojis. Similarly for each column. For any sequence of the same emoji that's length 2 or more, each possible consecutive pair within that sequence contributes to the count. Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". So a line here is a consecutive sequence of the same emoji. So, for example, if there's a row like [A, A, A], that's a horizontal line of length 3. How many such lines are there in that row? Well, the entire sequence is one line (length 3). But wait, the problem says \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So each such consecutive run (of length ≥2) is counted as one line. Oh, right! Because a line is a consecutive sequence. So a run of 3 same emojis is one line (length 3), a run of 2 is one line, etc.\n\nSo, for each row, we need to find all consecutive runs of the same emoji with length ≥2, and count each as 1. Similarly for each column.\n\nLet's take an example. Suppose a row is [A, A, B, B, B]. Then in this row, there are two horizontal lines: one of length 2 (A's) and one of length 3 (B's). So that contributes 2 to the total.\n\nAnother example: a row [A, A, A, A]. Then there's one horizontal line (length 4), so contributes 1.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each row in the board:\n   a. Split the row into consecutive runs of the same emoji.\n   b. For each run, if the length is ≥2, add 1 to the count.\n\n2. Do the same for each column in the board:\n   a. Split the column into consecutive runs of the same emoji.\n   b. For each run, if the length is ≥2, add 1 to the count.\n\nSo the total is the sum of all such runs in rows and columns.\n\nLet's get the board first. Let's list the rows. The board is given as:\n\nRow 0: 🦖🐫🐼🐼🐼🐺 → [🦖, 🐫, 🐼, 🐼, 🐼, 🐺]\nRow 1: 🐺🐼🐫🐺🐼🦖 → [🐺, 🐼, 🐫, 🐺, 🐼, 🦖]\nRow 2: 🐼🐫🦖🐺🦖🐫 → [🐼, 🐫, 🦖, 🐺, 🦖, 🐫]\nRow 3: 🐼🐺🐼🐼🐼🦖 → [🐼, 🐺, 🐼, 🐼, 🐼, 🦖]\nRow 4: 🐫🐼🐫🐼🐼🐺 → [🐫, 🐼, 🐫, 🐼, 🐼, 🐺]\nRow 5: 🦖🦖🐫🐺🐫🦖 → [🦖, 🦖, 🐫, 🐺, 🐫, 🦖]\n\nEach row has 6 elements (columns 0-5). The board is 6x6.\n\nLet's process each row first.\n\nRow 0: 🦖, 🐫, 🐼, 🐼, 🐼, 🐺\n\nCheck consecutive runs:\n- 🦖 (length 1) → no.\n- 🐫 (length 1) → no.\n- 🐼, 🐼, 🐼 (length 3) → yes, count 1.\n- 🐺 (length 1) → no.\nRow 0 contributes 1.\n\nRow 1: 🐺, 🐼, 🐫, 🐺, 🐼, 🦖\n\nEach element is different from the next. All runs are length 1. So 0.\n\nRow 2: 🐼, 🐫, 🦖, 🐺, 🦖, 🐫\n\nCheck runs:\n- 🐼 (1) → no.\n- 🐫 (1) → no.\n- 🦖 (1) → no.\n- 🐺 (1) → no.\n- 🦖 (1) → no.\n- 🐫 (1) → no.

So row 4 contributes 1.\n\nRow 5: 🦖, 🦖, 🐫, 🐺, 🐫, 🦖\n\nCheck runs:\n- 🦖, 🦖 (length 2) → yes, count 1.\n- 🐫 (1) → no.\n- 🐺 (1) → no.\n- 🐫 (1) → no.\n- 🦖 (1) → no. So row 5 contributes 1.\n\nTotal from rows: 1 (row0) + 0 (row1) + 0 (row2) + 1 (row3) + 1 (row4) + 1 (row5) = 4.\n\nNow process the columns. Let's list each column (each column has 6 elements, rows 0-5).\n\nColumns 0:\nRow0: 🦖\nRow1: 🐺\nRow2: 🐼\nRow3: 🐼\nRow4: 🐫\nRow5: 🦖\nSo column 0: [🦖, 🐺, 🐼, 🐼, 🐫, 🦖]\n\nCheck runs:\n- 🦖 (1) → no.\n- 🐺 (1) → no.\n- 🐼, 🐼 (length 2) → yes, count 1.\n- 🐫 (1) → no.\n- 🦖 (1) → no.

So column 3 contributes 2.\n\nColumn 4:\nRow0: 🐼\nRow1: 🐼\nRow2: 🦖\nRow3: 🐼\nRow4: 🐼\nRow5: 🐫\nColumn4: [🐼, 🐼, 🦖, 🐼, 🐼, 🐫]\n\nCheck runs:\n- 🐼, 🐼 (length 2) → yes, count 1.\n- 🦖 (1) → no.\n- 🐼, 🐼 (length 2) → yes, count 1.\n- 🐫 (1) → no. So column 4 contributes 2.\n\nColumn 5:\nRow0: 🐺\nRow1: 🦖\nRow2: 🐫\nRow3: 🦖\nRow4: 🐺\nRow5: 🦖\nColumn5: [🐺, 🦖, 🐫, 🦖, 🐺, 🦖]\n\nCheck runs:\nEach element is different from the next. All runs length 1. 0.\n\nNow, sum the columns' contributions: 1 (col0) + 0 (col1) + 1 (col2) + 2 (col3) + 2 (col4) + 0 (col5) = 6.\n\nTotal lines: rows (4) + columns (6) = 10.\n\nWait, let's double-check each step.\n\nRows:\n\nRow0: [🦖, 🐫, 🐼, 🐼, 🐼, 🐺] → runs of 3 🐼 → 1. Correct.\n\nRow1: All single. 0. Correct.\n\nRow2: All single. 0. Correct.\n\nRow3: [🐼, 🐺, 🐼, 🐼, 🐼, 🦖] → 3 🐼 → 1. Correct.\n\nRow4: [🐫, 🐼, 🐫, 🐼, 🐼, 🐺] → 2 🐼 → 1. Correct.\n\nRow5: [🦖, 🦖, ...] → 2 🦖 → 1. Correct. Sum 1+0+0+1+1+1=4. Correct.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 0: [🦖, 🐺, 🐼, 🐼, 🐫, 🦖] → 2 🐼 → 1. Correct.\n\nColumn 1: [🐫, 🐼, 🐫, 🐺, 🐼, 🦖] → 0. Correct.\n\nColumn 2: [🐼, 🐫, 🦖, 🐼, 🐫, 🐫] → 2 🐫 → 1. Correct.\n\nColumn3: [🐼, 🐺, 🐺, 🐼, 🐼, 🐺] → 2 🐺 and 2 🐼 → 2. Correct.\n\nColumn4: [🐼, 🐼, 🦖, 🐼, 🐼, 🐫] → 2 🐼 (start) and 2 🐼 (later) → 2. Correct.\n\nColumn5: [🐺, 🦖, 🐫, 🦖, 🐺, 🦖] → 0. Correct. Sum 1+0+1+2+2+0=6. Correct.\n\nTotal 4+6=10. So the answer should be 10.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more. A line is defined as a consecutive sequence of the same emoji with length ≥ 2. We process each row (horizontal) and each column (vertical) to identify such lines.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Horizontal Lines (Rows)**: For each row, check consecutive sequences of the same emoji. Count each sequence of length ≥ 2 as one line.\n2. **Vertical Lines (Columns)**: For each column, check consecutive sequences of the same emoji. Count each sequence of length ≥ 2 as one line.\n3. Sum the counts from horizontal and vertical lines to get the total number of valid lines.\n\n### Solution Code\nThe board is a 6x6 grid. We analyze each row and column as follows:\n\n#### Rows Analysis:\n- **Row 0**: `🦖🐫🐼🐼🐼🐺`  \n  Consecutive runs: `🦖` (1), `🐫` (1), `🐼` (3), `🐺` (1). Only the run of `🐼` (length 3) counts.

So, the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines of the same emoji with length 2 or more. Hmm, let's break this down. \n\nFirst, I need to check each row for horizontal sequences and each column for vertical sequences. For each possible sequence of length 2 or more, I need to count it. Wait, but how exactly? Like, a sequence of length 3 would have two overlapping pairs? Or does a sequence of length k contribute (k-1) lines? Because, for example, a horizontal line of 3 same emojis in a row would be positions (i,j), (i,j+1), (i,j+2). The horizontal lines here are (i,j)-(i,j+1) and (i,j+1)-(i,j+2), which are two lines. So each consecutive pair in a longer sequence counts as a separate line.\n\nYes, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So a line of length 2 is one line. A line of length 3 would have two lines (each adjacent pair). Because a line of length 3 is 3 emojis in a row, which includes two overlapping lines of length 2. For example, \"AAA\" has two lines: positions 0-1 and 1-2.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor each row (horizontal check):\n- Iterate through each position in the row, check consecutive emojis. For each group of same emojis of length L (L >=2), add (L-1) to the total count.\n\nSimilarly, for each column (vertical check):\n- Iterate through each position in the column, check consecutive emojis. For each group of same emojis of length L (L >=2), add (L-1) to the total count.\n\nSo let's start by writing down the board. Let's index the rows from 0 to 5 (since there are 6 rows), and columns 0 to 5 (6 columns). Let's list each row as a string of emojis for easier processing.\n\nRow 0: 🦞🐆🐆🐛🐆🐆 → indexes 0-5\nRow 1: 🌊🐆🦞🦞🌊🌙\nRow 2: 🌊🦞🌊🐆🦞🌙\nRow 3: 🐆🦞🌊🌊🐆🐛\nRow 4: 🌙🌙🌊🌊🐛🌙\nRow 5: 🌊🌙🌊🐛🐆🌊\n\nNow let's process horizontal lines first.\n\nProcessing horizontal lines (each row):\n\nRow 0: 🦞, 🐆, 🐆, 🐛, 🐆, 🐆\n\nCheck consecutive pairs:\n- (0,0) and (0,1): 🦞 vs 🐆 → different.\n- (0,1) and (0,2): 🐆 vs 🐆 → same.

So rows are 0-9, columns 0-9.\n\nFor horizontal lines: For each row, check consecutive emojis. For a row, we can look at runs of the same emoji. Each run of length L (L >=2) contributes (L-1) lines? Wait, wait. Wait, the problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". So a horizontal line is a consecutive sequence of the same emoji of length 2 or more. Each such consecutive sequence counts as one line. For example, if there's a run of 3 same emojis, that's a single line of length 3, which is counted once. Because the line is the entire consecutive sequence. Oh right! Because a line of length 2 is two in a row, length 3 is three in a row, etc. So each consecutive run of length L >=2 contributes 1 to the count. So for a run of 2, count 1. Run of 3, count 1. Run of 4, count 1, etc. Because each run is a single line. Oh, right. Because a line of 3 is a longer line, but it's still one line. So the question is, how many such runs are there in horizontal and vertical directions.\n\nSo for horizontal:\n\nFor each row (0-9), iterate through each position in the row (columns 0-9). We need to find all consecutive sequences (runs) of the same emoji with length >=2.\n\nLet's think of an example. Suppose a row is [A, A, B, B, B, C]. Then the horizontal lines here are: the two A's (length 2, count 1), the three B's (length 3, count 1). So total 2.\n\nSimilarly for vertical: For each column (0-9), iterate through each position in the column (rows 0-9). Find consecutive runs of same emoji with length >=2. Each such run counts as 1.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Process each row to count horizontal runs of length >=2.\n\n2. Process each column to count vertical runs of length >=2.\n\n3. Sum both counts for the answer.\n\nNow, how to implement this? Let's think of steps.\n\nFor horizontal processing:\n\nLoop over each row (i from 0 to 9):\n\n   current_emoji = board[i][0]\n\n   current_length = 1\n\n   for j from 1 to 9:\n\n      if board[i][j] == current_emoji:\n\n          current_length +=1\n\n      else:\n\n          if current_length >=2:\n\n              count +=1\n\n          current_emoji = board[i][j]\n\n          current_length =1\n\n   After the loop, check if the last run (current_length) is >=2, add 1 if so.\n\nSame logic for vertical processing:\n\nLoop over each column (j from 0 to 9):\n\n   current_emoji = board[0][j]\n\n   current_length =1\n\n   for i from 1 to 9:\n\n      if board[i][j] == current_emoji:\n\n          current_length +=1\n\n      else:\n\n          if current_length >=2:\n\n              count +=1\n\n          current_emoji = board[i][j]\n\n          current_length =1\n\n   After loop, check current_length >=2, add 1 if so.\n\nYes. So the key is to track runs in each row and column, and count each run of length >=2 as 1.\n\nNow, let's process the given board. Let's first list out the board rows.\n\nThe given board is:\n\nRow 0: 🐓🦐🦨🦮💫🦮🦐🦨🌕💫\n\nRow 1: 🦮🌕🦨🦐🌕🐓💫🦐🦐🐓\n\nRow 2: 🦨🦭🦭🐰💫💫🐓🐓🦭🦭\n\nRow 3: 🦮🦮🐰🦐🐓🦮🦐🦭💫🐓\n\nRow 4: 🦨🐰🦮🐰🐓🐰🦨💫🐰🦐\n\nRow 5: 💫🦭💫🦐🦐🦮🦐🦮🦐🐓\n\nRow 6: 🦭🐓🦐🦨🐰🦮🦮🌕🦨🐓\n\nRow 7: 🨨💫💫🐓🦨🐰🦨🦐🌕🦐  Wait, wait, the input says:\n\nOriginal input rows (as per user):\n\nRow 0: 🐓🦐🦨🦮💫🦮🦐🦨🌕💫\n\nRow 1: 🦮🌕🦨🦐🌕🐓💫🦐🦐🐓\n\nRow 2: 🦨🦭🦭🐰💫💫🐓🐓🦭🦭\n\nRow 3: 🦮🦮🐰🦐🐓🦮🦐🦭💫🐓\n\nRow 4: 🦨🐰🦮🐰🐓🐰🦨💫🐰🦐\n\nRow 5: 💫🦭💫🦐🦐🦮🦐🦮🦐🐓\n\nRow 6: 🦭🐓🦐🦨🐰🦮🦮🌕🦨🐓\n\nRow 7: 🦨💫💫🐓🦨🐰🦨🦐🌕🦐\n\nRow 8: 🌕💫🦐🦮🦐🦮🐰💫🦐💫\n\nRow 9: 🐰💫🦨🐓💫🦮🐰🦨💫💫\n\nSo 10 rows, 10 columns. Let's process each row for horizontal runs.\n\nLet's start with Row 0: \"🐓🦐🦨🦮💫🦮🦐🦨🌕💫\"\n\nIndices 0-9:\n\n0: 🐓\n\n1: 🦐\n\n2: 🦨\n\n3: 🦮\n\n4: 💫\n\n5: 🦮\n\n6: 🦐\n\n7: 🦨\n\n8: 🌕\n\n9: 💫\n\nEach emoji is different from the next. So all runs are length 1. So no horizontal runs here. So 0.\n\nRow 1: \"🦮🌕🦨🦐🌕🐓💫🦐🦐🐓\"\n\nIndices 0-9:\n\n0: 🦮\n\n1: 🌕\n\n2: 🦨\n\n3: 🦐\n\n4: 🌕\n\n5: 🐓\n\n6: 💫\n\n7: 🦐\n\n8: 🦐 (same as 7)\n\n9: 🐓\n\nSo let's track runs:\n\nStart at 0: 🦮 (length 1). Next (1) 🌕: different. Run length 1. No count.\n\nNext, 1: 🌕 (length 1). Next (2) 🦨: different. No count.\n\n2: 🦨 (1). Next (3) 🦐: different. No.\n\n3: 🦐 (1). Next (4) 🌕: different. No.\n\n4: 🌕 (1). Next (5) 🐓: different. No.\n\n5: 🐓 (1). Next (6) 💫: different. No.\n\n6: 💫 (1). Next (7) 🦐: different. No.\n\n7: 🦐 (1). Next (8) 🦐: same. Length becomes 2.\n\nThen, next (9) 🐓: different. So the run from 7-8 (length 2). So count 1.\n\nAfter processing 9, check the last run. The last run was from 8 (🦐) to 9 (🐓), which was a run of 1 (since 8 and 9 are different). So total for row 1: 1.\n\nRow 2: \"🦨🦭🦭🐰💫💫🐓🐓🦭🦭\"\n\nIndices 0-9:\n\n0: 🦨\n\n1: 🦭 (same as 2? Let's see. 0: 🦨, 1: 🦭, 2: 🦭. So 1 and 2 are same. Let's process step by step.\n\nRun tracking:\n\nStart with 0: 🦨 (length 1). Next 1: 🦭. Different. Run ends (length 1). No count.\n\nNow current emoji is 🦭 (index 1). Next 2: 🦭. Same. Length 2.\n\nNext 3: 🐰. Different. So run from 1-2 (length 2). Count +=1.\n\nNow current emoji is 🐰 (index 3). Next 4: 💫. Different. Run length 1. No.\n\nCurrent emoji is 💫 (index4). Next 5: 💫. Same. Length 2.\n\nNext 6: 🐓. Different. Run 4-5 (length 2). Count +=1.\n\nCurrent emoji is 🐓 (index6). Next 7: 🐓. Same. Length 2.\n\nNext 8: 🦭. Different. Run 6-7 (length 2). Count +=1.\n\nCurrent emoji is 🦭 (index8). Next 9: 🦭. Same. Length 2.\n\nLoop ends. So the last run is 8-9 (length 2). Count +=1.\n\nSo row 2 has 1 (1-2) + 1 (4-5) + 1 (6-7) + 1 (8-9) = 4.\n\nRow 3: \"🦮🦮🐰🦐🐓🦮🦐🦭💫🐓\"\n\nIndices 0-9:\n\n0: 🦮, 1: 🦮. Same. So first run.\n\n0: 🦮, 1: 🦮 (length 2). Next 2: 🐰. Different. So run 0-1 (length 2). Count +=1.\n\nThen current emoji is 🐰 (index2). Next 3: 🦐. Different. Run 1. No.\n\nCurrent emoji 🦐 (3). Next 4: 🐓. Different. No.\n\nCurrent emoji 🐓 (4). Next 5: 🦮. Different. No.\n\nCurrent emoji 🦮 (5). Next 6: 🦐. Different. No.\n\nCurrent emoji 🦐 (6). Next 7: 🭭 (assuming \"🦭\" here). Different. No.\n\nCurrent emoji 🦭 (7). Next 8: 💫. Different. No.\n\nCurrent emoji 💫 (8). Next 9: 🐓. Different. No.\n\nAfter loop, check last run. The last run is 9 (🐓), length 1. So row 3 has 1.\n\nRow 4: \"🦨🐰🦮🐰🐓🐰🦨💫🐰🦐\"\n\nLet's list the emojis:\n\n0: 🦨\n\n1: 🐰\n\n2: 🦮\n\n3: 🐰\n\n4: 🐓\n\n5: 🐰\n\n6: 🦨\n\n7: 💫\n\n8: 🐰\n\n9: 🦐\n\nEach consecutive is different. So no runs. 0.\n\nRow 5: \"💫🦭💫🦐🦐🦮🦐🦮🦐🐓\"\n\nIndices 0-9:\n\n0: 💫, 1: 🦭 (diff), 2: 💫 (diff), 3: 🦐, 4: 🦐 (same).\n\nProcessing:\n\n0: 💫, next 1: 🦭 (diff). Run 1, no count.\n\n1: 🦭, next 2: 💫 (diff). Run 1, no.\n\n2: 💫, next 3: 🦐 (diff). Run 1, no.\n\n3: 🦐, next 4: 🦐 (same). Length 2.\n\nNext 5: 🦮 (diff). So run 3-4 (length 2). Count +=1.\n\n5: 🦮, next 6: 🦐 (diff). Run 1, no.\n\n6: 🦐, next 7: 🦮 (diff). Run 1, no.\n\n7: 🦮, next 8: 🦐 (diff). Run 1, no.\n\n8: 🦐, next 9: 🐓 (diff). Run 1, no.\n\nSo row 5 has 1.\n\nRow 6: \"🦭🐓🦐🦨🐰🦮🦮🌕🦨🐓\"\n\nIndices 0-9:\n\n0: 🦭, 1: 🐓 (diff), 2: 🦐 (diff), 3: 🦨 (diff), 4: 🐰 (diff), 5: 🦮, 6: 🦮 (same).\n\nProcessing:\n\n0: 🦭, 1: 🐓 → diff. Run 1.\n\n1: 🐓, 2: 🦐 → diff. Run 1.\n\n2: 🦐, 3: 🦨 → diff. Run 1.\n\n3: 🦨, 4: 🐰 → diff. Run 1.\n\n4: 🐰, 5: 🦮 → diff. Run 1.\n\n5: 🦮, 6: 🦮 → same. Length 2.\n\nNext 7: 🌕 → diff. So run 5-6 (length 2). Count +=1.\n\n7: 🌕, 8: 🦨 → diff. Run 1.\n\n8: 🦨, 9: 🐓 → diff. Run 1.\n\nSo row 6: 1.\n\nRow 7: \"🦨💫💫🐓🦨🐰🦨🦐🌕🦐\"\n\nIndices 0-9:\n\n0: 🦨, 1: 💫, 2: 💫 (same).\n\nProcessing:\n\n0: 🦨, 1: 💫 → diff. Run 1.\n\n1: 💫, 2: 💫 → same. Length 2.\n\nNext 3: 🐓 → diff. Run 1-2 (length 2). Count +=1.\n\n3: 🐓, 4: 🦨 → diff. Run 1.\n\n4: 🦨, 5: 🐰 → diff. Run 1.\n\n5: 🐰, 6: 🦨 → diff. Run 1.\n\n6: 🦨, 7: 🦐 → diff. Run 1.\n\n7: 🦐, 8: 🌕 → diff. Run 1.\n\n8: 🌕, 9: 🦐 → diff. Run 1.\n\nSo row 7: 1.\n\nRow 8: \"🌕💫🦐🦮🦐🦮🐰💫🦐💫\"\n\nIndices 0-9:\n\n0: 🌕, 1: 💫 (diff), 2: 🦐 (diff), 3: 🦮 (diff), 4: 🦐 (diff), 5: 🦮 (diff), 6: 🐰 (diff), 7: 💫 (diff), 8: 🦐 (diff), 9: 💫 (diff). All consecutive are different. 0.\n\nRow 9: \"🐰💫🦨🐓💫🦮🐰🦨💫💫\"\n\nIndices 0-9:\n\n0: 🐰, 1: 💫 (diff), 2: 🦨 (diff), 3: 🐓 (diff), 4: 💫 (diff), 5: 🦮 (diff), 6: 🐰 (diff), 7: 🦨 (diff), 8: 💫, 9: 💫 (same).\n\nProcessing:\n\n0-7: all diff. Then 8: 💫, 9: 💫. Run 8-9 (length 2). Count +=1.\n\nSo row 9: 1.\n\nNow sum all horizontal counts:\n\nRow 0: 0\n\nRow 1: 1 → total 1\n\nRow 2: 4 → total 5\n\nRow 3: 1 → 6\n\nRow 4: 0 → 6\n\nRow 5: 1 →7\n\nRow 6: 1 →8\n\nRow 7:1 →9\n\nRow 8:0 →9\n\nRow 9:1 →10. So horizontal total is 10.\n\nNow vertical processing. Let's process each column (0-9) and check for vertical runs.\n\nLet's list the columns. Each column has 10 elements (rows 0-9).\n\nColumn 0 (j=0):\n\nRow 0: 🐓\n\nRow 1: 🦮\n\nRow 2: 🦨\n\nRow 3: 🦮\n\nRow 4: 🦨\n\nRow 5: 💫\n\nRow 6: 🦭\n\nRow 7: 🦨\n\nRow 8: 🌕\n\nRow 9: 🐰\n\nAll elements in column 0 are distinct. So 0.\n\nColumn 1 (j=1):\n\nRow 0: 🦐\n\nRow 1: 🌕\n\nRow 2: 🦭\n\nRow 3: 🦮\n\nRow 4: 🐰\n\nRow 5: 🦭\n\nRow 6: 🐓\n\nRow 7: 💫\n\nRow 8: 💫\n\nRow 9: 💫\n\nLet's process:\n\nRow 0: 🦐. Next row 1: 🌕 → diff. Run 1.\n\nRow 1: 🌕. Next row 2: 🦭 → diff. Run 1.\n\nRow 2: 🦭. Next row 3: 🦮 → diff. Run 1.\n\nRow 3: 🦮. Next row4: 🐰 → diff. Run 1.\n\nRow4: 🐰. Next row5: 🦭 → diff. Run 1.\n\nRow5: 🦭. Next row6: 🐓 → diff. Run 1.\n\nRow6: 🐓. Next row7: 💫 → diff. Run 1.\n\nRow7: 💫. Next row8: 💫 → same. Length 2.\n\nRow8: 💫. Next row9: 💫 → same. Length 3.\n\nLoop ends. So the run starts at row7, length 3 (rows7-8-9). So since length >=2, count 1.\n\nSo column 1 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 2 (j=2):\n\nRow 0: 🦨\n\nRow 1: 🦨\n\nRow 2: 🦭\n\nRow 3: 🐰\n\nRow 4: 🦮\n\nRow 5: 💫\n\nRow 6: 🦐\n\nRow 7: 💫\n\nRow 8: 🦐\n\nRow 9: 🦨\n\nProcessing:\n\nRow0: 🦨.

Each run with a length of 2 or more is counted as one line.\n2. **Vertical Lines**: For each column, identify consecutive sequences (runs) of the same emoji. Each run with a length of 2 or more is counted as one line.\n\n### Solution Code\nWe process each row and column to count the valid runs:\n\n#### Horizontal Processing\n- For each row, iterate through the emojis, tracking consecutive runs of the same emoji. If a run ends (i.e., the next emoji is different) and the run length is ≥ 2, increment the count. After processing the entire row, check the last run to ensure it is counted if valid.\n\n#### Vertical Processing\n- For each column, iterate through the emojis, tracking consecutive runs of the same emoji.

The task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines of the same emoji with length 2 or more. So, first, I need to check each row for horizontal sequences and each column for vertical sequences. \n\nLet me start by understanding the problem better. For a horizontal line in a row, we look for consecutive same emojis. For example, if a row has \"🌒🌒🐴\", then the two 🌒s form a line of length 2. Similarly, if there's a longer sequence like \"🐏🐏🐏\", that's a line of length 3. But wait, how do we count overlapping or consecutive sequences? Like, in \"aaa\", the sequences are \"aa\" (positions 0-1), \"aa\" (positions 1-2), so that's two lines. Oh right, because each consecutive pair of 2 or more counts. So a sequence of length L contributes (L-1) lines. Because for L=2, it's 1 line. For L=3, 2 lines (positions 0-1, 1-2). For L=4, 3 lines, etc.\n\nSame for vertical lines. So the plan is:\n\n1. For each row in the board, process each row to find consecutive same emojis, calculate the number of lines (sum (L-1) for each consecutive run of length L ≥2).\n2. Do the same for each column: process each column to find consecutive same emojis, sum (L-1) for each run of L ≥2.\n3. Sum all these values from rows and columns to get the total.\n\nSo first, let's get the board data. The board is given as 10 rows, each with 10 emojis. Let's list them out row by row.\n\nRow 0: 🌒, 🐴, 🐘, 🐏, 🐘, 🌒, 🌒, 🐏, 🐬, 🐘\nRow 1: 🌒, 🐘, 🐬, 🌒, 🌒, 🦙, 🐘, 🐏, 🦆, 🐘\nRow 2: 🦆, 🐏, 🐬, 🐘, 🐏, 🐴, 🦆, 🐏, 🦆, 🐬\nRow 3: 🐬, 🐘, 🌿, 🌿, 🌒, 🐴, 🐬, 🌒, 🐏, 🐘\nRow 4: 🐬, 🐏, 🐏, 🌿, 🌿, 🦙, 🐬, 🌿, 🌒, 🐴\nRow 5: 🦙, 🦙, 🦆, 🌒, 🐏, 🐏, 🐏, 🦆, 🌒, 🦆\nRow 6: 🐬, 🌒, 🐬, 🦆, 🐴, 🐬, 🌿, 🌒, 🌿, 🐴\nRow 7: 🦆, 🐘, 🐬, 🐴, 🐬, 🐏, 🐘, 🐏, 🐘, 🐬\nRow 8: 🌿, 🌒, 🐬, 🐬, 🐏, 🦙, 🐘, 🦆, 🐬, 🐏\nRow 9: 🦙, 🐴, 🐏, 🦙, 🌿, 🌒, 🌿, 🐘, 🐬, 🌒\n\nNow, let's process each row first for horizontal lines.\n\nRow 0: 🌒, 🐴, 🐘, 🐏, 🐘, 🌒, 🌒, 🐏, 🐬, 🐘\n\nLet's check consecutive same emojis:\n\n- 0: 🌒. Next is 🐴 (different). No run.\n- 1: 🐴. Next is 🐘 (diff). No run.\n- 2: 🐘. Next is 🐏 (diff). No run.\n- 3: 🐏. Next is 🐘 (diff). No run.\n- 4: 🐘. Next is 🌒 (diff). No run.\n- 5: 🌒. Next is 🌒 (same). So here, positions 5 and 6 are 🌒, 🌒. That's a run of length 2. So contributes 1 line.\n- 6: 🌒. Next is 🐏 (diff). So run ends. So 5-6 is 2, contributes 1.\n- 7: 🐏. Next is 🐬 (diff). No run.\n- 8: 🐬. Next is 🐘 (diff). No run.\n- 9: 🐘. End. No run.\nSo row 0 horizontal count: 1.\n\nRow 1: 🌒, 🐘, 🐬, 🌒, 🌒, 🦙, 🐘, 🐏, 🦆, 🐘\n\nCheck consecutive:\n\n- 0: 🌒. Next 🐘 (diff). No.\n- 1: 🐘. Next 🐬 (diff). No.\n- 2: 🐬. Next 🌒 (diff). No.\n- 3: 🌒. Next 🌒 (same). So 3-4: 🌒, 🌒. Run length 2. Contributes 1.\n- 4: 🌒. Next 🦙 (diff). So run ends. So 1 here.\n- 5: 🦙. Next 🐘 (diff). No.\n- 6: 🐘. Next 🐏 (diff). No.\n- 7: 🐏. Next 🦆 (diff). No.\n- 8: 🦆. Next 🐘 (diff). No.\n- 9: 🐘. End. No.\nRow 1 horizontal: 1.\n\nRow 2: 🦆, 🐏, 🐬, 🐘, 🐏, 🐴, 🦆, 🐏, 🦆, 🐬\n\nCheck:\n\n- 0: 🦆. Next 🐏 (diff). No.\n- 1: 🐏. Next 🐬 (diff). No.\n- 2: 🐬. Next 🐘 (diff). No.\n- 3: 🐘. Next 🐏 (diff). No.\n- 4: 🐏. Next 🐴 (diff). No.\n- 5: 🐴. Next 🦆 (diff). No.\n- 6: 🦆. Next 🐏 (diff). No.\n- 7: 🐏. Next 🦆 (diff). No.\n- 8: 🦆. Next 🐬 (diff). No.\n- 9: 🐬. End. No runs. So row 2 horizontal: 0.\n\nRow 3: 🐬, 🐘, 🌿, 🌿, 🌒, 🐴, 🐬, 🌒, 🐏, 🐘\n\nCheck:\n\n- 0: 🐬. Next 🐘 (diff). No.\n- 1: 🐘. Next 🌿 (diff). No.\n- 2: 🌿. Next 🌿 (same). So 2-3: 🌿, 🌿. Run length 2. Contributes 1.\n- 3: 🌿. Next 🌒 (diff). So run ends. 1 here.\n- 4: 🌒. Next 🐴 (diff). No.\n- 5: 🐴. Next 🐬 (diff). No.\n- 6: 🐬. Next 🌒 (diff). No.\n- 7: 🌒. Next 🐏 (diff). No.\n- 8: 🐏. Next 🐘 (diff). No.\nRow 3 horizontal: 1.\n\nRow 4: 🐬, 🐏, 🐏, 🌿, 🌿, 🦙, 🐬, 🌿, 🌒, 🐴\n\nCheck:\n\n- 0: 🐬. Next 🐏 (diff). No.\n- 1: 🐏. Next 🐏 (same). So 1-2: 🐏, 🐏. Run length 2.

Run length 2. Contributes 1.\n- 1: 🦙. Next 🦆 (diff). Run ends. 1 here.\n- 2: 🦆. Next 🌒 (diff). No.\n- 3: 🌒. Next 🐏 (diff). No.\n- 4: 🐏. Next 🐏 (same). 4-5: 🐏, 🐏. Then 5-6: 🐏, 🐏. So run length 3. So 3-1=2 (since 3 elements: 4,5,6. So 3-1=2 lines: 4-5, 5-6).\n- 4: 🐏. Next 5: 🐏 (same). 5: 🐏 next 6: 🐏 (same). So 4-5-6 is a run of 3. So 3-1=2.\n- 6: 🐏. Next 🦆 (diff). So 4-5-6 contributes 2.\n- 7: 🦆. Next 🌒 (diff). No.\n- 8: 🌒. Next 🦆 (diff). No.\n- 9: 🦆. End. No.\nSo row 5 horizontal: 1 (from 0-1) + 2 (from 4-5-6) = 3.\n\nRow 6: 🐬, 🌒, 🐬, 🦆, 🐴, 🐬, 🌿, 🌒, 🌿, 🐴\n\nCheck:\n\n- 0: 🐬. Next 🌒 (diff). No.\n- 1: 🌒. Next 🐬 (diff). No.\n- 2: 🐬. Next 🦆 (diff).

Contributes 1.\n- 3: 🐬. Next 🐏 (diff). Run ends. 1 here.\n- 4: 🐏. Next 🦙 (diff). No.\n- 5: 🦙. Next 🐘 (diff). No.\n- 6: 🐘. Next 🦆 (diff). No.\n- 7: 🦆. Next 🐬 (diff). No.\n- 8: 🐬. Next 🐏 (diff). No.\nRow 8 horizontal: 1.\n\nRow 9: 🦙, 🐴, 🐏, 🦙, 🌿, 🌒, 🌿, 🐘, 🐬, 🌒\n\nCheck:\n\n- 0: 🦙. Next 🐴 (diff). No.\n- 1: 🐴. Next 🐏 (diff). No.\n- 2: 🐏. Next 🦙 (diff). No.\n- 3: 🦙. Next 🌿 (diff). No.\n- 4: 🌿. Next 🌒 (diff). No.\n- 5: 🌒. Next 🌿 (diff). No.\n- 6: 🌿. Next 🐘 (diff). No.\n- 7: 🐘. Next 🐬 (diff). No.\n- 8: 🐬. Next 🌒 (diff). No.\n- 9: 🌒. End. No runs. So row 9 horizontal: 0.\n\nNow, sum all horizontal counts:\n\nRow 0:1, row1:1, row2:0, row3:1, row4:2, row5:3, row6:0, row7:0, row8:1, row9:0.\n\nTotal horizontal: 1+1+0+1+2+3+0+0+1+0 = 9.\n\nNow, let's process the vertical lines. Columns are 10 columns (0-9), each with 10 elements (rows 0-9).\n\nLet's list each column's elements.\n\nColumn 0: [row0:🌒, row1:🌒, row2:🦆, row3:🐬, row4:🐬, row5:🦙, row6:🐬, row7:🦆, row8:🌿, row9:🦙]\n\nColumn 1: [row0:🐴, row1:🐘, row2:🐏, row3:🐘, row4:🐏, row5:🦙, row6:🌒, row7:🐘, row8:🌒, row9:🐴]\n\nColumn 2: [row0:🐘, row1:🐬, row2:🐬, row3:🌿, row4:🐏, row5:🦆, row6:🐬, row7:🐬, row8:🐬, row9:🐏]\n\nColumn 3: [row0:🐏, row1:🌒, row2:🐘, row3:🌿, row4:🌿, row5:🌒, row6:🦆, row7:🐴, row8:🐬, row9:🦙]\n\nColumn 4: [row0:🐘, row1:🌒, row2:🐏, row3:🌒, row4:🌿, row5:🐏, row6:🐴, row7:🐬, row8:🐏, row9:🌿]\n\nColumn 5: [row0:🌒, row1:🦙, row2:🐴, row3:🐴, row4:🦙, row5:🐏, row6:🐬, row7:🐏, row8:🦙, row9:🌒]\n\nColumn 6: [row0:🌒, row1:🐘, row2:🦆, row3:🐬, row4:🐬, row5:🐏, row6:🌿, row7:🐘, row8:🐘, row9:🌿]\n\nColumn 7: [row0:🐏, row1:🐏, row2:🐏, row3:🌒, row4:🌿, row5:🦆, row6:🌒, row7:🐏, row8:🦆, row9:🐘]\n\nColumn 8: [row0:🐬, row1:🦆, row2:🦆, row3:🐏, row4:🌒, row5:🌒, row6:🌿, row7:🐘, row8:🐬, row9:🐬]\n\nColumn 9: [row0:🐘, row1:🐘, row2:🐬, row3:🐘, row4:🐴, row5:🦆, row6:🐴, row7:🐬, row8:🐏, row9:🌒]\n\nNow, let's process each column for vertical runs.\n\nColumn 0: 🌒, 🌒, 🦆, 🐬, 🐬, 🦙, 🐬, 🦆, 🌿, 🦙\n\nCheck consecutive same:\n\n- 0: 🌒. Next 1: 🌒 (same). So 0-1: 🌒, 🌒. Run length 2. Contributes 1.\n- 1: 🌒. Next 2: 🦆 (diff). So run ends. 1 here.\n- 2: 🦆. Next 3: 🐬 (diff). No.\n- 3: 🐬. Next 4: 🐬 (same). 3-4: 🐬, 🐬. Run length 2.

So 6-7-8: run of 3. 3-1=2 lines.\n- 6: 🐬. 7: 🐬 (same). 8: 🐬 (same). So 6-7-8: 3 elements. So 2 lines (6-7, 7-8).\n- 8: 🐬. Next 9: 🐏 (diff). So 6-7-8 contributes 2.\nSo column 2 vertical: 1 (from 1-2) + 2 (from 6-7-8) = 3.\n\nColumn 3: 🐏, 🌒, 🐘, 🌿, 🌿, 🌒, 🦆, 🐴, 🐬, 🦙\n\nCheck:\n\n- 0: 🐏. Next 🌒 (diff). No.\n- 1: 🌒. Next 🐘 (diff).

So the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines of the same emoji with length 2 or more. Hmm, I need to check each row for horizontal lines and each column for vertical lines. Let's start by understanding what counts as a line. For example, if a row has three consecutive same emojis, that's two lines: one of length 2 (the first two) and another of length 2 (the last two), or wait, no. Wait, no, maybe it's the number of consecutive runs of length >=2. Like, a run of length 3 would count as 1 line (since it's a single line of 3), a run of 4 would count as 1 line of 4, but maybe the problem counts each possible consecutive pair? Wait, the question says \"lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more\". So a line is a consecutive sequence of the same emoji, length 2 or more. So for a run of length k (k >=2), how many such lines are there? Oh, wait, maybe each maximal consecutive sequence of the same emoji of length >=2 counts as one line. For example, in a row like [A, A, A], that's a single horizontal line of length 3, so counts as 1. Similarly, [A, A, B, B, B] would have two lines: one of length 2 (A's) and one of length 3 (B's). Because each maximal run of same emojis of length >=2 is a line. Because if you have a run of 3, it's a single line of length 3. So the problem is to count all such maximal runs (consecutive same emojis) in horizontal and vertical directions, where the length is at least 2.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each row in the board, check for horizontal runs of same emojis with length >=2. Each such run contributes 1 to the total.\n\n2. For each column in the board, check for vertical runs of same emojis with length >=2. Each such run contributes 1 to the total.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nFirst, process each row. For each row, iterate through the elements, track current emoji and current run length. When the next emoji is the same, increment run length. When it changes, check if the previous run was >=2. If yes, add 1 to the count. Also, after processing the entire row, check the last run.\n\nSame for columns: for each column index, iterate through each row, track current emoji and run length. When moving to the next row, check if same as current. If not, check the run length.\n\nLet's start with the given board. Let's list out the rows first. The board is 10x10 (since each line has 10 emojis, 10 rows). Let's index rows from 0 to 9, columns 0 to 9.\n\nFirst, process horizontal lines (rows):\n\nRow 0: 🥰🦍🐨🌰😀🐨🐭🌰💦🌰\n\nLet's list each element:\n\nIndices 0: 🥰, 1: 🦍, 2: 🐨, 3: 🌰, 4: 😀, 5: 🐨, 6: 🐭, 7: 🌰, 8: 💦, 9: 🌰.\n\nCheck runs:\n\n- 🥰: length 1 (no)\n- 🦍: 1 (no)\n- 🐨: 1 (no)\n- 🌰: 1 (no)\n- 😀: 1 (no)\n- 🐨: 1 (no)\n- 🐭: 1 (no)\n- 🌰: 1 (no)\n- 💦: 1 (no)\n- 🌰: 1 (no)\nSo row 0 has 0 horizontal lines.\n\nRow 1: 😀🌰🦍🌰🥰🐭💦🦍🐨🥰\n\nElements: 0:😀, 1:🌰, 2:🦍, 3:🌰, 4:🥰, 5:🐭, 6:💦, 7:🦍, 8:🐨, 9:🥰.\n\nAll elements are unique in consecutive positions. So 0.\n\nRow 2: 💦😀🥰🐖🌰💦🥰🦍🌰😀\n\nElements: 0:💦, 1:😀, 2:🥰, 3:🐖, 4:🌰, 5:💦, 6:🥰, 7:🦍, 8:🌰, 9:😀. All consecutive different. 0.\n\nRow 3: 🦍💦🐨🐖🦍💦🐨💦🐭🦍\n\nElements: 0:🦍,1:💦,2:🐨,3:🐖,4:🦍,5:💦,6:🐨,7:💦,8:🐭,9:🦍. All consecutive different. 0.\n\nRow 4: 🐨🦍🥰🥰🐭🦍😀🌰🐖🌰\n\nElements: 0:🐨,1:🦍,2:🥰,3:🥰,4:🐭,5:🦍,6:😀,7:🌰,8:🐖,9:🌰.\n\nCheck runs:\n\nAt index 2 and 3: 🥰, 🥰. So run length 2. So this is a horizontal line. So count 1.\n\nRow 4 contributes 1.\n\nRow 5: 😀💦🥰🐨🐭🐭💦🦍🦍😀\n\nElements: 0:😀,1:💦,2:🥰,3:🐨,4:🐭,5:🐭,6:💦,7:🦍,8:🦍,9:😀.\n\nRuns:\n\n4-5: 🐭,🐭 → length 2 → count 1.\n\n7-8: 🦍,🦍 → length 2 → count 1. So row 5 contributes 2.\n\nRow 6: 🥰🥰🥰🐭💦🐨🐨🐨🐖🐨\n\nElements: 0:🥰,1:🥰,2:🥰,3:🐭,4:💦,5:🐨,6:🐨,7:🐨,8:🐖,9:🐨.\n\nRuns:\n\n0-1-2: 🥰,🥰,🥰 → length 3 → count 1 (since it's a run of 3, which is >=2).\n\n5-6-7: 🐨,🐨,🐨 → length 3 → count 1. So row 6 contributes 2.\n\nRow 7: 🐖🐨🐖💦🐭🌰🐭🐨🌰🌰\n\nElements: 0:🐖,1:🐨,2:🐖,3:💦,4:🐭,5:🌰,6:🐭,7:🐨,8:🌰,9:🌰.\n\nRuns:\n\n8-9: 🌰,🌰 → length 2 → count 1. So row 7 contributes 1.\n\nRow 8: 🥰🐨😀🦍🥰🐨💦🌰🐭🥰\n\nElements: 0:🥰,1:🐨,2:😀,3:🦍,4:🥰,5:🐨,6:💦,7:🌰,8:🐭,9:🥰. All consecutive different. 0.\n\nRow 9: 🐭🥰💦🐨🐨💦🐖🥰🌰🐭\n\nElements: 0:🐭,1:🥰,2:💦,3:🐨,4:🐨,5:💦,6:🐖,7:🥰,8:🌰,9:🐭.\n\nRuns: 3-4: 🐨,🐨 → length 2 → count 1. So row 9 contributes 1.\n\nSo sum of horizontal lines: 0 (row0) + 0 (row1) +0 (row2) +0 (row3) +1 (row4) +2 (row5) +2 (row6) +1 (row7) +0 (row8) +1 (row9) = 0+0+0+0+1+2+2+1+0+1=7.\n\nNow process vertical lines (columns). There are 10 columns (0-9). For each column, check vertical runs.\n\nLet's list each column's elements (rows 0-9):\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow 0: 🥰\n\nRow 1: 😀\n\nRow 2: 💦\n\nRow 3: 🦍\n\nRow 4: 🐨\n\nRow 5: 😀\n\nRow 6: 🥰\n\nRow 7: 🐖\n\nRow 8: 🥰\n\nRow 9: 🐭\n\nCheck vertical runs. Let's list them in order:\n\n🥰, 😀, 💦, 🦍, 🐨, 😀, 🥰, 🐖, 🥰, 🐭. All different. So 0.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow 0: 🦍\n\nRow 1: 🌰\n\nRow 2: 😀\n\nRow 3: 💦\n\nRow4: 🦍\n\nRow5: 💦\n\nRow6: 🥰\n\nRow7: 🐨\n\nRow8: 🐨\n\nRow9: 🥰\n\nElements: 🦍, 🌰, 😀, 💦, 🦍, 💦, 🥰, 🐨, 🐨, 🥰.\n\nCheck runs:\n\nLooking for consecutive same. Let's list the sequence:\n\nRow0: 🦍\n\nRow1: 🌰 (different from previous, run length 1)\n\nRow2: 😀 (diff, run 1)\n\nRow3: 💦 (diff, run 1)\n\nRow4: 🦍 (diff, run 1)\n\nRow5: 💦 (diff, run 1)\n\nRow6: 🥰 (diff, run 1)\n\nRow7: 🐨 (diff, run 1)\n\nRow8: 🐨 (same as row7. So run length 2. Then row9: 🥰 (diff). So run from 7-8: 🐨,🐨 → length 2. So count 1.\n\nSo column 1 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow0: 🐨\n\nRow1: 🦍\n\nRow2: 🥰\n\nRow3: 🐨\n\nRow4: 🥰\n\nRow5: 🥰\n\nRow6: 🥰\n\nRow7: 🐖\n\nRow8: 😀\n\nRow9: 💦\n\nElements: 🐨, 🦍, 🥰, 🐨, 🥰, 🥰, 🥰, 🐖, 😀, 💦.\n\nCheck runs:\n\nRow4: 🥰, row5: 🥰, row6: 🥰. So run from 4-5-6: 🥰,🥰,🥰 → length 3. So count 1.\n\nAny other runs? Let's check:\n\nRow0: 🐨 (1)\n\nRow1: 🦍 (1)\n\nRow2: 🥰 (1)\n\nRow3: 🐨 (1)\n\nRow4: 🥰 (start run: 1)\n\nRow5: 🥰 → 2\n\nRow6: 🥰 → 3 (so run length 3, which is >=2 → count 1)\n\nRow7: 🐖 (diff, run ends. So that's 1 run here.\n\nRow8: 😀 (1)\n\nRow9: 💦 (1). So column 2 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow0: 🌰\n\nRow1: 🌰\n\nRow2: 🐖\n\nRow3: 🐖\n\nRow4: 🐭\n\nRow5: 🐨\n\nRow6: 🐭\n\nRow7: 💦\n\nRow8: 🦍\n\nRow9: 🐨\n\nElements: 🌰, 🌰, 🐖, 🐖, 🐭, 🐨, 🐭, 💦, 🦍, 🐨.\n\nCheck runs:\n\nRow0: 🌰, row1: 🌰 → length 2. So count 1.\n\nRow2: 🐖, row3: 🐖 → length 2. Count another 1. So column 3 contributes 2.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nRow0: 😀\n\nRow1: 🥰\n\nRow2: 🌰\n\nRow3: 🦍\n\nRow4: 🐭\n\nRow5: 🐭\n\nRow6: 💦\n\nRow7: 🐭\n\nRow8: 🥰\n\nRow9: 🐨\n\nElements: 😀, 🥰, 🌰, 🦍, 🐭, 🐭, 💦, 🐭, 🥰, 🐨.\n\nCheck runs:\n\nRow4: 🐭, row5: 🐭 → length 2. So count 1.\n\nAny others? Let's see:\n\nRow0: 😀 (1)\n\nRow1: 🥰 (1)\n\nRow2: 🌰 (1)\n\nRow3: 🦍 (1)\n\nRow4: 🐭 (start run: 1)\n\nRow5: 🐭 → 2 → count 1.\n\nRow6: 💦 (diff, run ends).\n\nRow7: 🐭 (1)\n\nRow8: 🥰 (1)\n\nRow9: 🐨 (1). So column 4 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 5:\n\nRow0: 🐨\n\nRow1: 🐭\n\nRow2: 💦\n\nRow3: 💦\n\nRow4: 🦍\n\nRow5: 🐭\n\nRow6: 🐨\n\nRow7: 🌰\n\nRow8: 🐨\n\nRow9: 💦\n\nElements: 🐨, 🐭, 💦, 💦, 🦍, 🐭, 🐨, 🌰, 🐨, 💦.\n\nCheck runs:\n\nRow2: 💦, row3: 💦 → length 2. So count 1.\n\nOther elements are single. So column 5 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 6:\n\nRow0: 🐭\n\nRow1: 💦\n\nRow2: 🥰\n\nRow3: 🐨\n\nRow4: 😀\n\nRow5: 💦\n\nRow6: 🐨\n\nRow7: 🐭\n\nRow8: 💦\n\nRow9: 🐖\n\nElements: 🐭, 💦, 🥰, 🐨, 😀, 💦, 🐨, 🐭, 💦, 🐖. All consecutive different. 0.\n\nColumn 7:\n\nRow0: 🌰\n\nRow1: 🦍\n\nRow2: 🦍\n\nRow3: 💦\n\nRow4: 🌰\n\nRow5: 🦍\n\nRow6: 🐨\n\nRow7: 🐨\n\nRow8: 🌰\n\nRow9: 🥰\n\nElements: 🌰, 🦍, 🦍, 💦, 🌰, 🦍, 🐨, 🐨, 🌰, 🥰.\n\nCheck runs:\n\nRow1: 🦍, row2: 🦍 → length 2 → count 1.\n\nRow6: 🐨, row7: 🐨 → length 2 → count 1. So column 7 contributes 2.\n\nColumn 8:\n\nRow0: 💦\n\nRow1: 🐨\n\nRow2: 🌰\n\nRow3: 🐭\n\nRow4: 🐖\n\nRow5: 🦍\n\nRow6: 🐖\n\nRow7: 🌰\n\nRow8: 🐭\n\nRow9: 🌰\n\nElements: 💦, 🐨, 🌰, 🐭, 🐖, 🦍, 🐖, 🌰, 🐭, 🌰. All consecutive different. 0.\n\nColumn 9:\n\nRow0: 🌰\n\nRow1: 🥰\n\nRow2: 😀\n\nRow3: 🦍\n\nRow4: 🌰\n\nRow5: 😀\n\nRow6: 🐨\n\nRow7: 🌰\n\nRow8: 🥰\n\nRow9: 🐭\n\nElements: 🌰, 🥰, 😀, 🦍, 🌰, 😀, 🐨, 🌰, 🥰, 🐭. All consecutive different. 0.\n\nNow let's sum up vertical lines:\n\nColumn 0: 0\n\nColumn 1: 1 → total 1\n\nColumn 2: 1 → 2\n\nColumn 3: 2 → 4\n\nColumn 4: 1 → 5\n\nColumn 5: 1 → 6\n\nColumn 6: 0 → 6\n\nColumn 7: 2 → 8\n\nColumn 8: 0 → 8\n\nColumn 9: 0 → 8.\n\nSo vertical lines contribute 8.\n\nTotal lines: horizontal (7) + vertical (8) = 15.\n\nWait, let me recheck each column's count.\n\nLet me recheck column 3 again. Column 3's elements are:\n\nRow0: 🌰\n\nRow1: 🌰 → same as row0, so run of 2 (0-1). So that's 1.\n\nRow2: 🐖\n\nRow3: 🐖 → same as row2, run of 2 (2-3). That's another 1. So 2. Correct.\n\nColumn 7: elements:\n\nRow0: 🌰\n\nRow1: 🦍\n\nRow2: 🦍 → 1-2: same. Run of 2 → 1.\n\nRow3: 💦\n\nRow4: 🌰\n\nRow5: 🦍\n\nRow6: 🐨\n\nRow7: 🐨 → 6-7: same. Run of 2 → 1. So 2. Correct.\n\nColumn 2: elements:\n\nRow0: 🐨\n\nRow1: 🦍\n\nRow2: 🥰\n\nRow3: 🐨\n\nRow4: 🥰\n\nRow5: 🥰 → 4-5: same. Then row6: 🥰 → 5-6 same. So 4-5-6: three in a row. So that's a run of 3. So 1. Correct.\n\nColumn 5: row2: 💦, row3: 💦. 2-3: same. So 1. Correct.\n\nSo vertical lines sum to 8. Horizontal sum 7. 7+8=15.\n\nLet me recheck horizontal rows.\n\nRow 4: [🐨, 🦍, 🥰, 🥰, 🐭, 🦍, 😀, 🌰, 🐖, 🌰]. The run is 🥰, 🥰 (indices 2-3). So 1. Correct.\n\nRow 5: [😀, 💦, 🥰, 🐨, 🐭, 🐭, 💦, 🦍, 🦍, 😀]. The runs are 🐭,🐭 (4-5) and 🦍,🦍 (7-8). So 2. Correct.\n\nRow 6: [🥰,🥰,🥰,🐭,💦,🐨,🐨,🐨,🐖,🐨]. The runs are 🥰,🥰,🥰 (0-1-2) and 🐨,🐨,🐨 (5-6-7). So 2. Correct.\n\nRow 7: [🐖,🐨,🐖,💦,🐭,🌰,🐭,🐨,🌰,🌰]. The run is 🌰,🌰 (8-9). So 1. Correct.\n\nRow 9: [🐭,🥰,💦,🐨,🐨,💦,🐖,🥰,🌰,🐭]. The run is 🐨,🐨 (3-4). So 1. Correct.\n\nSumming those rows: 1 (row4) +2 (row5)+2 (row6)+1 (row7)+1 (row9) = 7. Correct.\n\nSo total is 7+8=15. So the answer is 15.\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more.

The task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, where each line has a length of 2 or more. Hmm, right. So first, I need to check each row for horizontal sequences and each column for vertical sequences.\n\nLet me start by looking at the board. Let's write down the board as rows to make it easier. The input board is given as:\n\nRow 0: ☀️❄️🪐☀️🪐❄️\nRow 1: 🪐🪐🪐🐮☀️☀️\nRow 2: 🪐☀️❄️❄️🪐❄️\nRow 3: ☀️🐮🪐☀️☀️☀️\nRow 4: ❄️☀️🐮☀️❄️❄️\nRow 5: 🐮☀️☀️🐮❄️🐮\n\nEach row has 6 elements. So there are 6 rows (indices 0-5) and 6 columns (indices 0-5).\n\nFirst, process horizontal lines. For each row, check consecutive same emojis. For a horizontal line, in a row, we need to find all sequences of the same emoji with length >=2. Each such consecutive run contributes (length -1) lines? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So a line is a consecutive sequence of the same emoji of length >=2. Each such sequence is a line, regardless of how long it is. For example, a run of 3 same emojis in a row would be one horizontal line (length 3), a run of 2 would be one line, a run of 4 would be one line, etc.\n\nWait, but the question is to count the number of such lines. So each contiguous block of same emojis of length >=2 counts as 1 line.\n\nWait, let's clarify. Suppose in a row, there's a sequence like A A A. That's a horizontal line of length 3. So that's one line. If there's A A B B, that's two lines (each of length 2). If there's A A A B B B, that's two lines. So the number of horizontal lines per row is the number of consecutive runs (of same emoji) where the run length is >=2.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each row, split into runs of same emoji. For each run, if the length is >=2, add 1 to the total.\n\nSimilarly, for each column, split into runs of same emoji. For each run, if the length is >=2, add 1 to the total.\n\nSo the total is the sum of horizontal lines and vertical lines.\n\nLet's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, process horizontal lines.\n\nRow 0: ☀️❄️🪐☀️🪐❄️. Let's list the elements: [☀️, ❄️, 🪐, ☀️, 🪐, ❄️]. All are different from their next, so no runs of length >=2. So 0 horizontal lines here.\n\nRow 1: 🪐🪐🪐🐮☀️☀️. Let's break it down:\n\n- 🪐, 🪐, 🪐: run length 3 (>=2) → 1 line.\n- Then 🐮 (length 1, no).\n- Then ☀️, ☀️: run length 2 → 1 line.\nTotal for row 1: 2.\n\nRow 2: 🪐☀️❄️❄️🪐❄️. Elements: [🪐, ☀️, ❄️, ❄️, 🪐, ❄️]\n\nRuns:\n- 🪐 (1)\n- ☀️ (1)\n- ❄️, ❄️ (2) → 1 line.\n- 🪐 (1)\n- ❄️ (1)\nSo row 2 has 1.\n\nRow 3: ☀️🐮🪐☀️☀️☀️. Elements: [☀️, 🐮, 🪐, ☀️, ☀️, ☀️]\n\nRuns:\n- ☀️ (1)\n- 🐮 (1)\n- 🪐 (1)\n- ☀️, ☀️, ☀️ (3) → 1 line.\nRow 3: 1.\n\nRow 4: ❄️☀️🐮☀️❄️❄️. Elements: [❄️, ☀️, 🐮, ☀️, ❄️, ❄️]\n\nRuns:\n- ❄️ (1)\n- ☀️ (1)\n- 🐮 (1)\n- ☀️ (1)\n- ❄️, ❄️ (2) → 1 line.\nRow 4: 1.\n\nRow 5: 🐮☀️☀️🐮❄️🐮. Elements: [🐮, ☀️, ☀️, 🐮, ❄️, 🐮]\n\nRuns:\n- 🐮 (1)\n- ☀️, ☀️ (2) → 1 line.\n- 🐮 (1)\n- ❄️ (1)\n- 🐮 (1)\nRow 5: 1.\n\nSo horizontal lines total: 0 (row0) + 2 (row1) +1 (row2) +1 (row3) +1 (row4) +1 (row5) = 6.\n\nNow, process vertical lines. Need to check each column (0-5) for vertical runs.\n\nEach column has 6 elements (rows 0-5). Let's list each column's elements.\n\nColumn 0:\nRow 0: ☀️\nRow 1: 🪐\nRow 2: 🪐\nRow 3: ☀️\nRow 4: ❄️\nRow 5: 🐮\nElements: [☀️, 🪐, 🪐, ☀️, ❄️, 🐮]\n\nCheck runs:\n- ☀️ (1)\n- 🪐, 🪐 (2) → 1 line.\n- ☀️ (1)\n- ❄️ (1)\n- 🐮 (1)\nSo column 0 has 1.\n\nColumn 1:\nRow 0: ❄️\nRow 1: 🪐\nRow 2: ☀️\nRow 3: 🐮\nRow 4: ☀️\nRow 5: ☀️\nElements: [❄️, 🪐, ☀️, 🐮, ☀️, ☀️]\n\nRuns:\n- ❄️ (1)\n- 🪐 (1)\n- ☀️ (1)\n- 🐮 (1)\n- ☀️, ☀️ (2) → 1 line.\nColumn 1: 1.\n\nColumn 2:\nRow 0: 🪐\nRow 1: 🪐\nRow 2: ❄️\nRow 3: 🪐\nRow 4: 🐮\nRow 5: ☀️\nElements: [🪐, 🪐, ❄️, 🪐, 🐮, ☀️]\n\nRuns:\n- 🪐, 🪐 (2) → 1 line.\n- ❄️ (1)\n- 🪐 (1)\n- 🐮 (1)\n- ☀️ (1)\nColumn 2: 1.\n\nColumn 3:\nRow 0: ☀️\nRow 1: 🐮\nRow 2: ❄️\nRow 3: ☀️\nRow 4: ☀️\nRow 5: 🐮\nElements: [☀️, 🐮, ❄️, ☀️, ☀️, 🐮]\n\nRuns:\n- ☀️ (1)\n- 🐮 (1)\n- ❄️ (1)\n- ☀️, ☀️ (2) → 1 line.\nColumn 3: 1.\n\nColumn 4:\nRow 0: 🪐\nRow 1: ☀️\nRow 2: 🪐\nRow 3: ☀️\nRow 4: ❄️\nRow 5: ❄️\nElements: [🪐, ☀️, 🪐, ☀️, ❄️, ❄️]\n\nRuns:\n- 🪐 (1)\n- ☀️ (1)\n- 🪐 (1)\n- ☀️ (1)\n- ❄️, ❄️ (2) → 1 line.\nColumn 4: 1.\n\nColumn 5:\nRow 0: ❄️\nRow 1: ☀️\nRow 2: ❄️\nRow 3: ☀️\nRow 4: ❄️\nRow 5: 🐮\nElements: [❄️, ☀️, ❄️, ☀️, ❄️, 🐮]\n\nCheck runs. All are single elements (each is different from next). So 0.\n\nSo vertical lines per column: 1 (col0) +1 (col1)+1 (col2)+1 (col3)+1 (col4)+0 (col5) = 5.\n\nTotal lines: horizontal (6) + vertical (5) = 11.\n\nWait, let me recheck each step.\n\nHorizontal lines:\n\nRow 0: All unique consecutive. 0. Correct.\n\nRow 1: [🪐,🪐,🪐] (3) → 1. Then [☀️,☀️] (2) → 1. Total 2. Correct.\n\nRow 2: [❄️,❄️] (2) → 1. Correct.\n\nRow 3: [☀️,☀️,☀️] (3) → 1. Correct.\n\nRow 4: [❄️,❄️] (2) → 1. Correct.\n\nRow 5: [☀️,☀️] (2) → 1. Correct. So 0+2+1+1+1+1=6. Correct.\n\nVertical lines:\n\nColumn 0: elements [☀️, 🪐, 🪐, ☀️, ❄️, 🐮]. The run is 🪐,🪐 (rows 1 and 2). So 1. Correct.\n\nColumn 1: elements [❄️, 🪐, ☀️, 🐮, ☀️, ☀️]. The run is ☀️,☀️ (rows 4 and 5). 1. Correct.\n\nColumn 2: elements [🪐, 🪐, ❄️, 🪐, 🐮, ☀️]. The run is 🪐,🪐 (rows 0 and 1). 1. Correct.\n\nColumn 3: elements [☀️, 🐮, ❄️, ☀️, ☀️, 🐮]. The run is ☀️,☀️ (rows 3 and 4). 1. Correct.\n\nColumn 4: elements [🪐, ☀️, 🪐, ☀️, ❄️, ❄️]. The run is ❄️,❄️ (rows 4 and 5). 1. Correct.\n\nColumn 5: elements [❄️, ☀️, ❄️, ☀️, ❄️, 🐮]. All consecutive elements are different. 0. Correct.\n\nSo 1+1+1+1+1+0=5.\n\nTotal 6+5=11. That's the answer.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, where each line has a length of 2 or more. We will check each row for horizontal lines and each column for vertical lines, counting all valid sequences.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Horizontal Lines**: For each row, identify consecutive sequences of the same emoji. A sequence of length 2 or more counts as one horizontal line.\n2. **Vertical Lines**: For each column, identify consecutive sequences of the same emoji. A sequence of length 2 or more counts as one vertical line.\n\n### Solution Code\nWe analyze the given board row by row and column by column to count valid sequences.\n\n#### Horizontal Lines Analysis\n- **Row 0**: `☀️❄️🪐☀️🪐❄️` (no sequences of length ≥2) → 0 lines.\n- **Row 1**: `🪐🪐🪐🐮☀️☀️` (sequences: `🪐🪐🪐` (length 3), `☀️☀️` (length 2)) → 2 lines.\n- **Row 2**: `🪐☀️❄️❄️🪐❄️` (sequence: `❄️❄️` (length 2)) → 1 line.\n- **Row 3**: `☀️🐮🪐☀️☀️☀️` (sequence: `☀️☀️☀️` (length 3)) → 1 line.\n- **Row 4**: `❄️☀️🐮☀️❄️❄️` (sequence: `❄️❄️` (length 2)) → 1 line.\n- **Row 5**: `🐮☀️☀️🐮❄️🐮` (sequence: `☀️☀️` (length 2)) → 1 line.\n\nTotal horizontal lines: \\(0 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6\\).\n\n#### Vertical Lines Analysis\n- **Column 0**: `☀️, 🪐, 🪐, ☀️, ❄️, 🐮` (sequence: `🪐🪐` (length 2)) → 1 line.\n- **Column 1**: `❄️, 🪐, ☀️, 🐮, ☀️, ☀️` (sequence: `☀️☀️` (length 2)) → 1 line.\n- **Column 2**: `🪐, 🪐, ❄️, 🪐, 🐮, ☀️` (sequence: `🪐🪐` (length 2)) → 1 line.\n- **Column 3**: `☀️, 🐮, ❄️, ☀️, ☀️, 🐮` (sequence: `☀️☀️` (length 2)) → 1 line.\n- **Column 4**: `🪐, ☀️, 🪐, ☀️, ❄️, ❄️` (sequence: `❄️❄️` (length 2)) → 1 line.\n- **Column 5**: `❄️, ☀️, ❄️, ☀️, ❄️, 🐮` (no sequences of length ≥2) → 0 lines.\n\nTotal vertical lines: \\(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 5\\).\n\n### Total Lines\nAdding horizontal and vertical lines gives \\(6 + 5 = 11\\).\n\nAnswer: 11"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

So the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines of the same emoji with length 2 or more. Hmm, right. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to process the board. The board is a list of rows, each row is a string of emojis. Let's see, the given board has 10 rows, each with 10 emojis (since each line here is 10 characters long). So rows are 0-9, columns 0-9.\n\nFor horizontal lines: check each row. For each row, look for consecutive same emojis. For example, in a row like \"A A A B B\", there's a horizontal line of 3 A's and 2 B's. Each of these counts as a line. But wait, the problem says lines of length 2 or more. So any consecutive run of length k (k >=2) contributes 1 line. Because a run of 3 same emojis is a single line of length 3, which is >=2, so that's 1. A run of 2 is 1, a run of 4 is 1, etc.\n\nSimilarly for vertical lines: check each column. For each column, look for consecutive same emojis in that column. Same logic: runs of 2 or more count as 1 per run.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Iterate over each row (horizontal direction) and count the number of consecutive runs of the same emoji with length >=2.\n2. Iterate over each column (vertical direction) and do the same.\n3. Sum all these counts.\n\nLet's start with horizontal lines. Let's list the rows first. Let's write down each row as a list of emojis.\n\nRow 0: ['🐵','🌾','🌾','🐓','🌾','🐓','🎁','🦚','🐰','🌱']\nRow 1: ['☀️','🎁','🐵','🦚','☀️','🐰','🌳','🦚','🌾','☀️']\nRow 2: ['☀️','🌳','🐵','🎁','🌱','🐓','🌱','🐵','🎁','🌱']\nRow 3: ['🌱','🦚','🐓','🐵','🌾','🎁','🦚','🎁','🐓','🐓']\nRow 4: ['🐵','🦚','🐓','🐵','🌾','🌱','🐰','☀️','🐰','🐓']\nRow 5: ['🌳','🐵','🦚','🐰','🌾','🌱','🌳','☀️','🌾','🌳']\nRow 6: ['🐰','🦚','🐵','🎁','🌱','🐵','🌳','☀️','🎁','🌳']\nRow 7: ['🐵','🦚','🐵','☀️','🐓','🐰','🌳','🌾','🐓','🌳']\nRow 8: ['🌱','🎁','☀️','🐰','🐓','🐓','🐵','🦚','🐵','🌳']\nRow 9: ['☀️','🐓','🐰','🦚','🌳','🌱','☀️','☀️','🌱','☀️']\n\nNow, let's process each row for horizontal runs.\n\nRow 0:\nCheck consecutive emojis. Let's list the positions:\n\n0: 🐵 (prev none)\n1: 🌾 (diff from 0)\n2: 🌾 (same as 1) → start of a run. Let's track runs. Let's see:\n\nStart index 1 (emoji 🌾), then 2: 🌾. So run length 2. Then 3: 🐓 (diff). So that's a run of 2. Count 1.\n\nThen 3: 🐓, 4: 🌾 (diff). No run here.\n\n4: 🌾, 5: 🐓 (diff). No.\n\n5: 🐓, 6: 🎁 (diff). No.\n\n6: 🎁, 7: 🦚 (diff). No.\n\n7: 🦚, 8: 🐰 (diff). No.\n\n8: 🐰, 9: 🌱 (diff). No.\n\nSo row 0 horizontal runs: 1 (the 🌾 at positions 1-2).\n\nRow 1:\nRow 1 emojis: ['☀️','🎁','🐵','🦚','☀️','🐰','🌳','🦚','🌾','☀️']\n\nCheck each position:\n\n0:☀️, 1:🎁 (diff)\n1:🎁, 2:🐵 (diff)\n2:🐵, 3:🦚 (diff)\n3:🦚,4:☀️ (diff)\n4:☀️,5:🐰 (diff)\n5:🐰,6:🌳 (diff)\n6:🌳,7:🦚 (diff)\n7:🦚,8:🌾 (diff)\n8:🌾,9:☀️ (diff)\nNo consecutive runs. So row 1 contributes 0.\n\nRow 2:\nRow 2: ['☀️','🌳','🐵','🎁','🌱','🐓','🌱','🐵','🎁','🌱']\n\nCheck:\n\n0:☀️,1:🌳 (diff)\n1:🌳,2:🐵 (diff)\n2:🐵,3:🎁 (diff)\n3:🎁,4:🌱 (diff)\n4:🌱,5:🐓 (diff)\n5:🐓,6:🌱 (diff)\n6:🌱,7:🐵 (diff)\n7:🐵,8:🎁 (diff)\n8:🎁,9:🌱 (diff)\nNo runs. So 0.\n\nRow 3:\nRow 3: ['🌱','🦚','🐓','🐵','🌾','🎁','🦚','🎁','🐓','🐓']\n\nCheck:\n\nLooking for consecutive same. Let's see:\n\n0:🌱,1:🦚 (diff)\n1:🦚,2:🐓 (diff)\n2:🐓,3:🐵 (diff)\n3:🐵,4:🌾 (diff)\n4:🌾,5:🎁 (diff)\n5:🎁,6:🦚 (diff)\n6:🦚,7:🎁 (diff)\n7:🎁,8:🐓 (diff)\n8:🐓,9:🐓 (same). So positions 8-9: 2 in a row. So run of 2. Count 1.\n\nSo row 3 contributes 1.\n\nRow 4:\nRow 4: ['🐵','🦚','🐓','🐵','🌾','🌱','🐰','☀️','🐰','🐓']\n\nCheck:\n\n0:🐵,1:🦚 (diff)\n1:🦚,2:🐓 (diff)\n2:🐓,3:🐵 (diff)\n3:🐵,4:🌾 (diff)\n4:🌾,5:🌱 (diff)\n5:🌱,6:🐰 (diff)\n6:🐰,7:☀️ (diff)\n7:☀️,8:🐰 (diff)\n8:🐰,9:🐓 (diff)\nNo runs. 0.\n\nRow 5:\nRow 5: ['🌳','🐵','🦚','🐰','🌾','🌱','🌳','☀️','🌾','🌳']\n\nCheck:\n\n0:🌳,1:🐵 (diff)\n1:🐵,2:🦚 (diff)\n2:🦚,3:🐰 (diff)\n3:🐰,4:🌾 (diff)\n4:🌾,5:🌱 (diff)\n5:🌱,6:🌳 (diff)\n6:🌳,7:☀️ (diff)\n7:☀️,8:🌾 (diff)\n8:🌾,9:🌳 (diff)\nNo runs. 0.\n\nRow 6:\nRow 6: ['🐰','🦚','🐵','🎁','🌱','🐵','🌳','☀️','🎁','🌳']\n\nCheck:\n\n0:🐰,1:🦚 (diff)\n1:🦚,2:🐵 (diff)\n2:🐵,3:🎁 (diff)\n3:🎁,4:🌱 (diff)\n4:🌱,5:🐵 (diff)\n5:🐵,6:🌳 (diff)\n6:🌳,7:☀️ (diff)\n7:☀️,8:🎁 (diff)\n8:🎁,9:🌳 (diff)\nNo runs. 0.\n\nRow 7:\nRow 7: ['🐵','🦚','🐵','☀️','🐓','🐰','🌳','🌾','🐓','🌳']\n\nCheck:\n\n0:🐵,1:🦚 (diff)\n1:🦚,2:🐵 (diff)\n2:🐵,3:☀️ (diff)\n3:☀️,4:🐓 (diff)\n4:🐓,5:🐰 (diff)\n5:🐰,6:🌳 (diff)\n6:🌳,7:🌾 (diff)\n7:🌾,8:🐓 (diff)\n8:🐓,9:🌳 (diff)\nNo runs. 0.\n\nRow 8:\nRow 8: ['🌱','🎁','☀️','🐰','🐓','🐓','🐵','🦚','🐵','🌳']\n\nCheck:\n\n0:🌱,1:🎁 (diff)\n1:🎁,2:☀️ (diff)\n2:☀️,3:🐰 (diff)\n3:🐰,4:🐓 (diff)\n4:🐓,5:🐓 (same). So positions 4-5: 2 in a row. Count 1.\nThen 5:🐓,6:🐵 (diff)\n6:🐵,7:🦚 (diff)\n7:🦚,8:🐵 (diff)\n8:🐵,9:🌳 (diff)\nSo row 8 contributes 1.\n\nRow 9:\nRow 9: ['☀️','🐓','🐰','🦚','🌳','🌱','☀️','☀️','🌱','☀️']\n\nCheck:\n\n0:☀️,1:🐓 (diff)\n1:🐓,2:🐰 (diff)\n2:🐰,3:🦚 (diff)\n3:🦚,4:🌳 (diff)\n4:🌳,5:🌱 (diff)\n5:🌱,6:☀️ (diff)\n6:☀️,7:☀️ (same). So positions 6-7: 2 in a row. Count 1.\n7:☀️,8:🌱 (diff)\n8:🌱,9:☀️ (diff)\nSo row 9 contributes 1.\n\nSo total horizontal runs: row 0 (1) + row 3 (1) + row 8 (1) + row 9 (1) → 4.\n\nNow, vertical lines. Need to check each column (0-9) and look for consecutive runs of same emoji in that column, with length >=2.\n\nLet's list the columns. Each column is 10 elements (rows 0-9). Let's process each column:\n\nColumn 0:\nRow 0: 🐵\nRow 1: ☀️\nRow 2: ☀️\nRow 3: 🌱\nRow 4: 🐵\nRow 5: 🌳\nRow 6: 🐰\nRow 7: 🐵\nRow 8: 🌱\nRow 9: ☀️\n\nCheck consecutive same in column 0. Let's list the elements in order:\n\n0: 🐵 (row 0)\n1: ☀️ (row 1)\n2: ☀️ (row 2) → same as row 1. So run starts at row 1 (☀️), row 2 is same. So run length 2 (rows 1-2). Count 1.\n3: 🌱 (row 3) → different from row 2 (☀️). So that's a run of 2 (count 1).\n4: 🐵 (row4) → different from 🌱.\n5: 🌳 (row5) → different.\n6: 🐰 (row6) → different.\n7: 🐵 (row7) → different.\n8: 🌱 (row8) → different.\n9: ☀️ (row9) → different.\nSo column 0 vertical runs: 1 (rows 1-2).\n\nColumn 1:\nRow0: 🌾\nRow1: 🎁\nRow2: 🌳\nRow3: 🦚\nRow4: 🦚\nRow5: 🐵\nRow6: 🦚\nRow7: 🦚\nRow8: 🎁\nRow9: 🐓\n\nCheck consecutive same:\n\nRow0: 🌾\nRow1: 🎁 → diff.\nRow2: 🌳 → diff.\nRow3: 🦚 → diff.\nRow4: 🦚 → same as row3. So run starts at row3. Let's check row4: same. So row3-4: 2 in a row. Count 1.\nRow5: 🐵 → diff from row4 (🦚). So that's a run of 2 (count 1).\nRow6: 🦚 → diff from row5 (🐵).\nRow7: 🦚 → same as row6 (🦚). So row6-7: 2 in a row. Count 1.\nRow8: 🎁 → diff.\nRow9: 🐓 → diff.\nSo column 1 has two runs: row3-4 (🦚) and row6-7 (🦚). So 2.\n\nColumn 2:\nRow0: 🌾\nRow1: 🐵\nRow2: 🐵\nRow3: 🐓\nRow4: 🐓\nRow5: 🦚\nRow6: 🐵\nRow7: 🐵\nRow8: ☀️\nRow9: 🐰\n\nCheck:\n\nRow0: 🌾\nRow1: 🐵 → diff.\nRow2: 🐵 → same as row1. So row1-2: 2. Count 1.\nRow3: 🐓 → diff.\nRow4: 🐓 → same as row3. So row3-4: 2. Count 1.\nRow5: 🦚 → diff.\nRow6: 🐵 → diff.\nRow7: 🐵 → same as row6 (🐵). So row6-7: 2. Count 1.\nRow8: ☀️ → diff.\nRow9: 🐰 → diff.\nSo column 2 has 3 runs. 1 (row1-2), 1 (row3-4), 1 (row6-7) → 3.\n\nColumn 3:\nRow0: 🐓\nRow1: 🦚\nRow2: 🎁\nRow3: 🐵\nRow4: 🐵\nRow5: 🐰\nRow6: 🎁\nRow7: ☀️\nRow8: 🐰\nRow9: 🦚\n\nCheck:\n\nRow0: 🐓\nRow1: 🦚 → diff.\nRow2: 🎁 → diff.\nRow3: 🐵 → diff.\nRow4: 🐵 → same as row3. So row3-4: 2. Count 1.\nRow5: 🐰 → diff.\nRow6: 🎁 → diff.\nRow7: ☀️ → diff.\nRow8: 🐰 → diff.\nRow9: 🦚 → diff.\nSo column 3 has 1 run (row3-4).\n\nColumn 4:\nRow0: 🌾\nRow1: ☀️\nRow2: 🌱\nRow3: 🌾\nRow4: 🌾\nRow5: 🌾\nRow6: 🌱\nRow7: 🐓\nRow8: 🐓\nRow9: 🌳\n\nCheck:\n\nRow0: 🌾\nRow1: ☀️ → diff.\nRow2: 🌱 → diff.\nRow3: 🌾 → diff.\nRow4: 🌾 → same as row3. So row3-4: 2. Then row5: 🌾 → same as row4. So run continues (row3-4-5: 3). So this is a single run of length 3 (>=2). Count 1.\nRow6: 🌱 → diff from row5 (🌾).\nRow7: 🐓 → diff.\nRow8: 🐓 → same as row7. So row7-8: 2. Count 1.\nRow9: 🌳 → diff.\nSo column 4 has 2 runs (row3-4-5 and row7-8). So 2.\n\nColumn 5:\nRow0: 🐓\nRow1: 🐰\nRow2: 🐓\nRow3: 🎁\nRow4: 🌱\nRow5: 🌱\nRow6: 🐵\nRow7: 🐰\nRow8: 🐓\nRow9: 🌱\n\nCheck:\n\nRow0: 🐓\nRow1: 🐰 → diff.\nRow2: 🐓 → diff.\nRow3: 🎁 → diff.\nRow4: 🌱 → diff.\nRow5: 🌱 → same as row4. So row4-5: 2. Count 1.\nRow6: 🐵 → diff.\nRow7: 🐰 → diff.\nRow8: 🐓 → diff.\nRow9: 🌱 → diff.\nSo column 5 has 1 run (row4-5).\n\nColumn 6:\nRow0: 🎁\nRow1: 🌳\nRow2: 🌱\nRow3: 🦚\nRow4: 🐰\nRow5: 🌳\nRow6: 🌳\nRow7: 🌳\nRow8: 🐵\nRow9: ☀️\n\nCheck:\n\nRow0: 🎁\nRow1: 🌳 → diff.\nRow2: 🌱 → diff.\nRow3: 🦚 → diff.\nRow4: 🐰 → diff.\nRow5: 🌳 → diff.\nRow6: 🌳 → same as row5. So row5-6: 2. Then row7: 🌳 → same as row6. So run row5-6-7: 3. So 1 run (count 1).\nRow8: 🐵 → diff.\nRow9: ☀️ → diff.\nSo column 6 has 1 run (row5-6-7).\n\nColumn 7:\nRow0: 🦚\nRow1: 🦚\nRow2: 🐵\nRow3: 🎁\nRow4: ☀️\nRow5: ☀️\nRow6: ☀️\nRow7: 🌾\nRow8: 🦚\nRow9: ☀️\n\nCheck:\n\nRow0: 🦚\nRow1: 🦚 → same as row0. So row0-1: 2. Count 1.\nRow2: 🐵 → diff.\nRow3: 🎁 → diff.\nRow4: ☀️ → diff.\nRow5: ☀️ → same as row4. So row4-5: 2. Then row6: ☀️ → same. So run row4-5-6: 3. Count 1.\nRow7: 🌾 → diff.\nRow8: 🦚 → diff.\nRow9: ☀️ → diff.\nSo column 7 has 2 runs (row0-1 and row4-5-6). 2.\n\nColumn 8:\nRow0: 🐰\nRow1: 🌾\nRow2: 🎁\nRow3: 🐓\nRow4: 🐰\nRow5: 🌾\nRow6: 🎁\nRow7: 🐓\nRow8: 🐵\nRow9: 🌱\n\nCheck:\n\nRow0: 🐰\nRow1: 🌾 → diff.\nRow2: 🎁 → diff.\nRow3: 🐓 → diff.\nRow4: 🐰 → diff.\nRow5: 🌾 → diff.\nRow6: 🎁 → diff.\nRow7: 🐓 → diff.\nRow8: 🐵 → diff.\nRow9: 🌱 → diff.\nNo consecutive same.

So row3-4: 2. Count 1.\nRow5: 🌳 → diff.\nRow6: 🌳 → same as row5. So row5-6: 2. Then row7: 🌳 → same (row5-6-7: 3). Then row8: 🌳 → same (row5-6-7-8: 4). So that's a single run of 4 (>=2). Count 1.\nRow9: ☀️ → diff.\nSo column 9 has 2 runs (row3-4 and row5-8). 2.\n\nLet's sum up the vertical runs:\n\nColumn 0: 1\nColumn 1: 2\nColumn 2: 3\nColumn 3: 1\nColumn 4: 2\nColumn 5: 1\nColumn 6: 1\nColumn 7: 2\nColumn 8: 0\nColumn 9: 2\n\nAdding these: 1+2=3; +3=6; +1=7; +2=9; +1=10; +1=11; +2=13; +0=13; +2=15. So vertical runs sum to 15.\n\nTotal lines = horizontal (4) + vertical (15) = 19.\n\nWait, let me double-check each column. Let's recheck column 7 again.\n\nColumn 7:\nRow0: 🦚, Row1: 🦚 → 2, so 1. Then row4: ☀️, row5: ☀️, row6: ☀️. That's 3 in a row. So that's 1 run. So 1+1=2. Correct.\n\nColumn 9: row3-4 (🐓,🐓) → 2, row5-8 (🌳,🌳,🌳,🌳) → 4, which is 1 run. So 1+1=2. Correct.\n\nColumn 4: row3-4-5 (🌾,🌾,🌾) → 3, row7-8 (🐓,🐓) → 2. 1+1=2. Correct.\n\nColumn 2: row1-2 (🐵,🐵) → 2, row3-4 (🐓,🐓) → 2, row6-7 (🐵,🐵) → 2. 3 runs. Correct.\n\nSo vertical sum 15, horizontal sum 4. 15+4=19.\n\nLet me check the horizontal again.\n\nRow 0: 🌾 at positions 1-2 (indices 1 and 2). That's 2, count 1.

So, the task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with length 2 or more. Hmm, right. So first, I need to check each row for horizontal sequences and each column for vertical sequences. For each sequence, I need to count how many lines of length 2 or more there are. \n\nLet me start by understanding the problem with an example. Suppose a row has a sequence like \"A A A\". Then, the horizontal lines here would be: positions (0,1), (1,2), and (0,1,2). Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Because a line of length 2 is two consecutive same emojis. A line of length 3 would have two overlapping lines of length 2 (the first two and the last two), plus the entire three as a line of length 3. Wait, no. The problem says \"lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\". So each such contiguous segment of length L contributes (L-1) lines? Or (L*(L-1))\/2? Because, for example, a segment of length 2: 1 line. Length 3: 2+1=3 lines (positions 0-1, 1-2, 0-1-2). Oh, wait, maybe that's how it's counted. Because each possible consecutive run of length k (k >=2) contributes (k - (k-1)) + ...? No, let's clarify.\n\nWait, let's take a simple example. Let's say a row is [A, A, A]. So horizontal lines here:\n\n- The first two A's (positions 0-1) → length 2.\n\n- The next two A's (positions 1-2) → length 2.\n\n- The entire three A's (positions 0-1-2) → length 3.\n\nSo that's 3 lines. Because 3 is (3-1) + (3-2) = 2 + 1? Or 3 is (3*(3-1))\/2. Oh right, for a run of length L, the number of possible consecutive sequences (lines) of length ≥2 is (L-1) + (L-2) + ... + 1 = L*(L-1)\/2. Because for each possible starting index and length ≥2. For example, L=2: 1 sequence (length 2). L=3: sequences of length 2 (two of them: positions 0-1, 1-2) and one of length 3 (0-1-2). So 2+1=3. Which is 3*2\/2=3. L=4: 3+2+1=6=4*3\/2. Oh right! Because for a run of L same emojis, the number of lines (contiguous sequences of length ≥2) is L*(L-1)\/2. Because each possible length from 2 to L. For length 2, there are (L-1) sequences. For length 3, (L-2), etc., down to 1 for length L. So sum from k=1 to (L-1) of k = L*(L-1)\/2.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the approach is:\n\nFor each row, scan horizontally, find all consecutive runs of the same emoji. For each run of length L, add L*(L-1)\/2 to the total.\n\nDo the same for each column, scanning vertically.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Process each row:\n\n   For each row in the board:\n\n   - Split into consecutive runs of the same emoji.\n\n   - For each run, if length >=2, compute L*(L-1)\/2 and add to total.\n\n2. Process each column:\n\n   For each column in the board:\n\n   - Split into consecutive runs of the same emoji.\n\n   - For each run, if length >=2, compute L*(L-1)\/2 and add to total.\n\n3. Sum all these values to get the answer.\n\nNow, let's get the board data. The input board is:\n\nRow 0: 🏄🐙🕷🦎🐙🦩🐙 → 7 emojis.\n\nRow 1: 🦩🐙🐋🦎🦩🐙🦎 → 7.\n\nRow 2: 🦩🦎🦎🏄🦩🏄🦎 → 7.\n\nRow 3: 🏄🕷🕷🦩🦩🐙🦎 → 7.\n\nRow 4: 🏄🏄🦩🕷🦩🕷🦎 → 7.\n\nRow 5: 🐙🐙🦎🐙🐋🕷🕷 → 7.\n\nRow 6: 🏄🕷🐙🏄🦩🦩🏄 → 7.\n\nSo 7 rows, 7 columns (since each row has 7 elements).\n\nLet's process rows first.\n\nProcessing Rows:\n\nRow 0: 🏄, 🐙, 🕷, 🦎, 🐙, 🦩, 🐙.\n\nCheck consecutive runs. Let's list each emoji:\n\nIndices 0: 🏄 (length 1)\n\n1: 🐙 (length 1)\n\n2: 🕷 (length 1)\n\n3: 🦎 (length 1)\n\n4: 🐙 (length 1)\n\n5: 🦩 (length 1)\n\n6: 🐙 (length 1)\n\nAll runs are length 1. So row 0 contributes 0.\n\nRow 1: 🦩, 🐙, 🐋, 🦎, 🦩, 🐙, 🦎.\n\nSame as row 0. All runs are length 1. So 0.\n\nRow 2: 🦩, 🦎, 🦎, 🏄, 🦩, 🏄, 🦎.\n\nLet's check:\n\nIndex 0: 🦩 (1)\n\n1-2: 🦎, 🦎 → length 2. So run length 2. So 2*(2-1)\/2 = 1.\n\nThen 3: 🏄 (1)\n\n4: 🦩 (1)\n\n5: 🏄 (1)\n\n6: 🦎 (1)\n\nSo row 2 contributes 1.\n\nRow 3: 🏄, 🕷, 🕷, 🦩, 🦩, 🐙, 🦎.\n\nCheck:\n\n0: 🏄 (1)\n\n1-2: 🕷, 🕷 → length 2 → 1.\n\n3-4: 🦩, 🦩 → length 2 → 1.\n\n5: 🐙 (1)\n\n6: 🦎 (1)\n\nTotal row 3: 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nRow 4: 🏄, 🏄, 🦩, 🕷, 🦩, 🕷, 🦎.\n\nCheck:\n\n0-1: 🏄, 🏄 → length 2 → 1.\n\n2: 🦩 (1)\n\n3: 🕷 (1)\n\n4: 🦩 (1)\n\n5: 🕷 (1)\n\n6: 🦎 (1)\n\nSo row 4 contributes 1.\n\nRow 5: 🐙, 🐙, 🦎, 🐙, 🐋, 🕷, 🕷.\n\nCheck:\n\n0-1: 🐙, 🐙 → length 2 → 1.\n\n2: 🦎 (1)\n\n3: 🐙 (1)\n\n4: 🐋 (1)\n\n5-6: 🕷, 🕷 → length 2 → 1.\n\nTotal row 5: 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nRow 6: 🏄, 🕷, 🐙, 🏄, 🦩, 🦩, 🏄.\n\nCheck:\n\n0: 🏄 (1)\n\n1: 🕷 (1)\n\n2: 🐙 (1)\n\n3: 🏄 (1)\n\n4-5: 🦩, 🦩 → length 2 → 1.\n\n6: 🏄 (1)\n\nRow 6 contributes 1.\n\nSo total from rows: 0 (row0) + 0 (row1) + 1 (row2) + 2 (row3) + 1 (row4) + 2 (row5) + 1 (row6) → 0+0=0; +1=1; +2=3; +1=4; +2=6; +1=7. So rows contribute 7.\n\nNow, process columns. There are 7 columns (each row has 7 elements, so columns 0-6).\n\nEach column has 7 elements (rows 0-6). Let's list each column's elements.\n\nLet's list each column:\n\nColumn 0 (rows 0-6):\n\nRow0: 🏄\n\nRow1: 🦩\n\nRow2: 🦩\n\nRow3: 🏄\n\nRow4: 🏄\n\nRow5: 🐙\n\nRow6: 🏄\n\nSo column 0 elements: [🏄, 🦩, 🦩, 🏄, 🏄, 🐙, 🏄]\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow0: 🐙\n\nRow1: 🐙\n\nRow2: 🦎\n\nRow3: 🕷\n\nRow4: 🏄\n\nRow5: 🐙\n\nRow6: 🕷\n\nColumn1: [🐙, 🐙, 🦎, 🕷, 🏄, 🐙, 🕷]\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow0: 🕷\n\nRow1: 🐋\n\nRow2: 🦎\n\nRow3: 🕷\n\nRow4: 🦩\n\nRow5: 🦎\n\nRow6: 🐙\n\nColumn2: [🕷, 🐋, 🦎, 🕷, 🦩, 🦎, 🐙]\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow0: 🦎\n\nRow1: 🦎\n\nRow2: 🏄\n\nRow3: 🦩\n\nRow4: 🕷\n\nRow5: 🐙\n\nRow6: 🏄\n\nColumn3: [🦎, 🦎, 🏄, 🦩, 🕷, 🐙, 🏄]\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow0: 🐙\n\nRow1: 🦩\n\nRow2: 🦩\n\nRow3: 🦩\n\nRow4: 🦩\n\nRow5: 🐋\n\nRow6: 🦩\n\nColumn4: [🐙, 🦩, 🦩, 🦩, 🦩, 🐋, 🦩]\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow0: 🦩\n\nRow1: 🐙\n\nRow2: 🏄\n\nRow3: 🐙\n\nRow4: 🕷\n\nRow5: 🕷\n\nRow6: 🦩\n\nColumn5: [🦩, 🐙, 🏄, 🐙, 🕷, 🕷, 🦩]\n\nColumn6:\n\nRow0: 🐙\n\nRow1: 🦎\n\nRow2: 🦎\n\nRow3: 🦎\n\nRow4: 🦎\n\nRow5: 🕷\n\nRow6: 🏄\n\nColumn6: [🐙, 🦎, 🦎, 🦎, 🦎, 🕷, 🏄]\n\nNow, process each column for vertical runs.\n\nLet's process each column one by one.\n\nColumn 0: [🏄, 🦩, 🦩, 🏄, 🏄, 🐙, 🏄]\n\nCheck consecutive runs:\n\nRow0: 🏄 (1)\n\nRow1-2: 🦩, 🦩 → length 2 → 1.\n\nRow3-4: 🏄, 🏄 → length 2 → 1.\n\nRow5: 🐙 (1)\n\nRow6: 🏄 (1)\n\nSo column 0 contributes 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nColumn 1: [🐙, 🐙, 🦎, 🕷, 🏄, 🐙, 🕷]\n\nCheck:\n\nRow0-1: 🐙, 🐙 → length 2 → 1.\n\nRow2: 🦎 (1)\n\nRow3: 🕷 (1)\n\nRow4: 🏄 (1)\n\nRow5: 🐙 (1)\n\nRow6: 🕷 (1)\n\nSo column 1 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 2: [🕷, 🐋, 🦎, 🕷, 🦩, 🦎, 🐙]\n\nAll elements are different. So 0.\n\nColumn 3: [🦎, 🦎, 🏄, 🦩, 🕷, 🐙, 🏄]\n\nCheck:\n\nRow0-1: 🦎, 🦎 → length 2 → 1.\n\nRow2: 🏄 (1)\n\nRow3: 🦩 (1)\n\nRow4: 🕷 (1)\n\nRow5: 🐙 (1)\n\nRow6: 🏄 (1)\n\nSo column 3 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 4: [🐙, 🦩, 🦩, 🦩, 🦩, 🐋, 🦩]\n\nCheck:\n\nRow0: 🐙 (1)\n\nRow1-4: 🦩, 🦩, 🦩, 🦩 → length 4. So 4*(4-1)\/2 = 4*3\/2=6.\n\nRow5: 🐋 (1)\n\nRow6: 🦩 (1)\n\nSo column 4 contributes 6.\n\nColumn 5: [🦩, 🐙, 🏄, 🐙, 🕷, 🕷, 🦩]\n\nCheck:\n\nRow0: 🦩 (1)\n\nRow1: 🐙 (1)\n\nRow2: 🏄 (1)\n\nRow3: 🐙 (1)\n\nRow4-5: 🕷, 🕷 → length 2 → 1.\n\nRow6: 🦩 (1)\n\nSo column 5 contributes 1.\n\nColumn 6: [🐙, 🦎, 🦎, 🦎, 🦎, 🕷, 🏄]\n\nCheck:\n\nRow0: 🐙 (1)\n\nRow1-4: 🦎, 🦎, 🦎, 🦎 → length 4. So 4*3\/2=6.\n\nRow5: 🕷 (1)\n\nRow6: 🏄 (1)\n\nSo column 6 contributes 6.\n\nNow sum up all columns:\n\nColumn0: 2\n\nColumn1:1 → total 3\n\nColumn2:0 → 3\n\nColumn3:1 →4\n\nColumn4:6 →10\n\nColumn5:1 →11\n\nColumn6:6 →17.\n\nSo columns contribute 17.\n\nTotal answer is rows (7) + columns (17) = 24.\n\nWait, let's check again. Let me recount the column contributions.\n\nColumn 0: 2 (correct: 1+1=2).\n\nColumn 1: 1 (correct: the first two 🐙).\n\nColumn 3: 1 (correct: first two 🦎).\n\nColumn 4: 4 consecutive 🦩. So 4 elements, L=4. 4*3\/2=6. Correct.\n\nColumn 6: 4 consecutive 🦎 (rows 1-4: 4 elements). 4*3\/2=6. Correct.\n\nSo columns 0 (2), 1 (1), 3 (1), 4 (6), 5 (1), 6 (6). Column 2 contributes 0.\n\nSum columns: 2 +1 +0 +1 +6 +1 +6 = 17. Correct.\n\nRows: 0 (row0) + 0 (row1) +1 (row2) +2 (row3) +1 (row4) +2 (row5) +1 (row6) → 0+0=0, +1=1, +2=3, +1=4, +2=6, +1=7. So 7.\n\nTotal 7+17=24.\n\nSo the answer should be 24.\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, where each line has a length of 2 or more. A line is defined as a contiguous sequence of the same emoji. For a contiguous sequence of length \\( L \\), the number of valid lines is given by \\( \\frac{L \\times (L - 1)}{2} \\), which accounts for all possible sub-sequences of length 2 or more within the sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Horizontal Lines**: For each row in the board, identify contiguous sequences of the same emoji. For each sequence of length \\( L \\geq 2 \\), add \\( \\frac{L \\times (L - 1)}{2} \\) to the total count.\n2. **Vertical Lines**: For each column in the board, identify contiguous sequences of the same emoji. For each sequence of length \\( L \\geq 2 \\), add \\( \\frac{L \\times (L - 1)}{2} \\) to the total count.\n\n### Solution Code\nThe board is given as follows:\n```\nRow 0: 🏄🐙🕷🦎🐙🦩🐙\nRow 1: 🦩🐙🐋🦎🦩🐙🦎\nRow 2: 🦩🦎🦎🏄🦩🏄🦎\nRow 3: 🏄🕷🕷🦩🦩🐙🦎\nRow 4: 🏄🏄🦩🕷🦩🕷🦎\nRow 5: 🐙🐙🦎🐙🐋🕷🕷\nRow 6: 🏄🕷🐙🏄🦩🦩🏄\n```\n\n### Calculations\n\n#### Horizontal Lines\n- **Row 0**: All emojis are unique.
