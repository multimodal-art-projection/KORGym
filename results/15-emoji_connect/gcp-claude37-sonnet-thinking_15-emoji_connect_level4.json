Let's first understand the board by identifying the rows and columns.\n\nThe board is a 10x10 grid of emojis. Let me analyze it row by row and column by column to find the lines.\n\nFirst, I'll look for horizontal lines (rows):\n\nRow 1: 🌼🐋🥀🚀🐚🚀🌳🐚🥀🚀\n- No horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 2: 🐚🌳🌳🌼🐫🥀🌳🌼🦔🌼\n- 🌳🌳 (positions 2-3)\n- 🌼🌼 (positions 8-10, but not next to each other)\n\nRow 3: 🐋🥀🐫🐫🥀🐚🦩🥀🦩🌳\n- 🐫🐫 (positions 3-4)\n- 🦩🥀🦩 (positions 7-9, but not next to each other)\n\nRow 4: 🦔🦩🐫🌼🐋🌼🌳🐋🐋🐋\n- 🐋🐋🐋 (positions 8-10)\n\nRow 5: 🚀🥀🐫🌳🌳🌼🥀🐫🌳🐚\n- 🌳🌳 (positions 4-5)\n\nRow 6: 🥀🐚🌳🥀🌼🥀🐋🥀🐚🐫\n- No horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 7: 🌳🦔🌼🐋🐚🚀🐋🚀🦩🐚\n- No horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 8: 🐫🌳🌳🚀🚀🦩🌳🥀🦔🥀\n- 🌳🌳 (positions 2-3)\n- 🚀🚀 (positions 4-5)\n\nRow 9: 🐚🥀🐋🐋🦔🐚🐫🐫🌼🌳\n- 🐋🐋 (positions 3-4)\n- 🐫🐫 (positions 7-8)\n\nRow 10: 🌼🌳🐫🌼🐋🐋🦩🐚🌳🐋\n- 🐋🐋 (positions 5-6)\n\nNow, I'll look for vertical lines (columns):\n\nColumn 1: 🌼🐚🐋🦔🚀🥀🌳🐫🐚🌼\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 2: 🐋🌳🥀🦩🥀🐚🦔🌳🥀🌳\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nI think I made a mistake above. I shouldn't consider emojis that are the same but not adjacent to each other as forming a line.\n\nLet me try again in a more systematic way. For each row and column, I'll find consecutive identical emojis and count them as a single line if the length is 2 or more.\n\nHorizontal lines:\n\nRow 1: 🌼🐋🥀🚀🐚🚀🌳🐚🥀🚀\n- No horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 2: 🐚🌳🌳🌼🐫🥀🌳🌼🦔🌼\n- 🌳🌳 (positions 2-3): 1 line\n\nRow 3: 🐋🥀🐫🐫🥀🐚🦩🥀🦩🌳\n- 🐫🐫 (positions 3-4): 1 line\n\nRow 4: 🦔🦩🐫🌼🐋🌼🌳🐋🐋🐋\n- 🐋🐋🐋 (positions 8-10): 1 line\n\nRow 5: 🚀🥀🐫🌳🌳🌼🥀🐫🌳🐚\n- 🌳🌳 (positions 4-5): 1 line\n\nRow 6: 🥀🐚🌳🥀🌼🥀🐋🥀🐚🐫\n- No horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 7: 🌳🦔🌼🐋🐚🚀🐋🚀🦩🐚\n- No horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 8: 🐫🌳🌳🚀🚀🦩🌳🥀🦔🥀\n- 🌳🌳 (positions 2-3): 1 line\n- 🚀🚀 (positions 4-5): 1 line\n\nRow 9: 🐚🥀🐋🐋🦔🐚🐫🐫🌼🌳\n- 🐋🐋 (positions 3-4): 1 line\n- 🐫🐫 (positions 7-8): 1 line\n\nRow 10: 🌼🌳🐫🌼🐋🐋🦩🐚🌳🐋\n- 🐋🐋 (positions 5-6): 1 line\n\nThat's a total of 9 horizontal lines.\n\nNow, let's look for vertical lines:\n\nI'll check each column to find consecutive identical emojis:\n\nColumn 1 (top to bottom): 🌼🐚🐋🦔🚀🥀🌳🐫🐚🌼\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 2 (top to bottom): 🐋🌳🥀🦩🥀🐚🦔🌳🥀🌳\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 3 (top to bottom): 🥀🌳🐫🐫🐫🌳🌼🌳🐋🐫\n- 🐫🐫🐫 (positions 3-5): 1 line\n- 🌳🌳 (positions 7-8): 1 line\n\nColumn 4 (top to bottom): 🚀🌼🐫🌼🌳🥀🐋🚀🐋🌼\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 5 (top to bottom): 🐚🐫🥀🐋🌳🌼🐚🚀🦔🐋\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 6 (top to bottom): 🚀🥀🐚🌼🌼🥀🚀🦩🐚🐋\n- 🌼🌼 (positions 4-5): 1 line\n\nColumn 7 (top to bottom): 🌳🌳🦩🌳🥀🐋🐋🌳🐫🦩\n- 🌳🌳 (positions 1-2): 1 line\n- 🐋🐋 (positions 6-7): 1 line\n\nColumn 8 (top to bottom): 🐚🌼🥀🐋🐫🥀🚀🥀🐫🐚\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 9 (top to bottom): 🥀🦔🦩🐋🌳🐚🦩🦔🌼🌳\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 10 (top to bottom): 🚀🌼🌳🐋🐚🐫🐚🥀🌳🐋\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nThat's a total of 5 vertical lines.\n\nSo, the total number of horizontal and vertical lines of length 2 or more is 9 + 5 = 14.\n\nWait, let me double-check some specific columns to make sure I didn't make an error:\n\nColumn 4 (top to bottom): 🚀🌼🐫🌼🌳🥀🐋🚀🐋🌼\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 5 (top to bottom): 🐚🐫🥀🐋🌳🌼🐚🚀🦔🐋\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 6 (top to bottom): 🚀🥀🐚🌼🌼🥀🚀🦩🐚🐋\n- 🌼🌼 (positions 4-5): 1 line\n\nActually, let me carefully check the entire board again to ensure accuracy. Let me rewrite the board for clarity:\n\n```\n🌼🐋🥀🚀🐚🚀🌳🐚🥀🚀\n🐚🌳🌳🌼🐫🥀🌳🌼🦔🌼\n🐋🥀🐫🐫🥀🐚🦩🥀🦩🌳\n🦔🦩🐫🌼🐋🌼🌳🐋🐋🐋\n🚀🥀🐫🌳🌳🌼🥀🐫🌳🐚\n🥀🐚🌳🥀🌼🥀🐋🥀🐚🐫\n🌳🦔🌼🐋🐚🚀🐋🚀🦩🐚\n🐫🌳🌳🚀🚀🦩🌳🥀🦔🥀\n🐚🥀🐋🐋🦔🐚🐫🐫🌼🌳\n🌼🌳🐫🌼🐋🐋🦩🐚🌳🐋\n```\n\nLet me analyze each row and column more carefully:\n\nHorizontal lines:\n\nRow 1: 🌼🐋🥀🚀🐚🚀🌳🐚🥀🚀\n- No horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 2: 🐚🌳🌳🌼🐫🥀🌳🌼🦔🌼\n- 🌳🌳 (positions 2-3): 1 line\n\nRow 3: 🐋🥀🐫🐫🥀🐚🦩🥀🦩🌳\n- 🐫🐫 (positions 3-4): 1 line\n\nRow 4: 🦔🦩🐫🌼🐋🌼🌳🐋🐋🐋\n- 🐋🐋🐋 (positions 8-10): 1 line\n\nRow 5: 🚀🥀🐫🌳🌳🌼🥀🐫🌳🐚\n- 🌳🌳 (positions 4-5): 1 line\n\nRow 6: 🥀🐚🌳🥀🌼🥀🐋🥀🐚🐫\n- No horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 7: 🌳🦔🌼🐋🐚🚀🐋🚀🦩🐚\n- No horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 8: 🐫🌳🌳🚀🚀🦩🌳🥀🦔🥀\n- 🌳🌳 (positions 2-3): 1 line\n- 🚀🚀 (positions 4-5): 1 line\n\nRow 9: 🐚🥀🐋🐋🦔🐚🐫🐫🌼🌳\n- 🐋🐋 (positions 3-4): 1 line\n- 🐫🐫 (positions 7-8): 1 line\n\nRow 10: 🌼🌳🐫🌼🐋🐋🦩🐚🌳🐋\n- 🐋🐋 (positions 5-6): 1 line\n\nThat's a total of 9 horizontal lines.\n\nNow, let's check each column carefully:\n\nColumn 1 (top to bottom): 🌼🐚🐋🦔🚀🥀🌳🐫🐚🌼\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 2 (top to bottom): 🐋🌳🥀🦩🥀🐚🦔🌳🥀🌳\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 3 (top to bottom): 🥀🌳🐫🐫🐫🌳🌼🌳🐋🐫\n- 🐫🐫🐫 (positions 3-5): 1 line\n- 🌳🌳 (positions 7-8): 1 line\n\nColumn 4 (top to bottom): 🚀🌼🐫🌼🌳🥀🐋🚀🐋🌼\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 5 (top to bottom): 🐚🐫🥀🐋🌳🌼🐚🚀🦔🐋\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 6 (top to bottom): 🚀🥀🐚🌼🌼🥀🚀🦩🐚🐋\n- 🌼🌼 (positions 4-5): 1 line\n\nColumn 7 (top to bottom): 🌳🌳🦩🌳🥀🐋🐋🌳🐫🦩\n- 🌳🌳 (positions 1-2): 1 line\n- 🐋🐋 (positions 6-7): 1 line\n\nColumn 8 (top to bottom): 🐚🌼🥀🐋🐫🥀🚀🥀🐫🐚\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 9 (top to bottom): 🥀🦔🦩🐋🌳🐚🦩🦔🌼🌳\n- 🦔🦔 (positions 2-8): Not a line because they're not consecutive.\n- Actually, I need to double-check: 🥀🦔🦩🐋🌳🐚🦩🦔🌼🌳. Yes, there are no vertical lines of length 2 or more in this column.\n\nColumn 10 (top to bottom): 🚀🌼🌳🐋🐚🐫🐚🥀🌳🐋\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nThat's a total of 5 vertical lines.\n\nSo, the total number of horizontal and vertical lines of length 2 or more is 9 + 5 = 14.\n\nActually, I think I might have made an error in my column analysis. Let me count the columns from the 1st column (leftmost) to the 10th column (rightmost) to make sure I get the right emojis:\n\nColumn 1: 🌼🐚🐋🦔🚀🥀🌳🐫🐚🌼\nColumn 2: 🐋🌳🥀🦩🥀🐚🦔🌳🥀🌳\nColumn 3: 🥀🌳🐫🐫🐫🌳🌼🌳🐋🐫\nColumn 4: 🚀🌼🐫🌼🌳🥀🐋🚀🐋🌼\nColumn 5: 🐚🐫🥀🐋🌳🌼🐚🚀🦔🐋\nColumn 6: 🚀🥀🐚🌼🌼🥀🚀🦩🐚🐋\nColumn 7: 🌳🌳🦩🌳🥀🐋🐋🌳🐫🦩\nColumn 8: 🐚🌼🥀🐋🐫🥀🚀🥀🐫🐚\nColumn 9: 🥀🦔🦩🐋🌳🐚🦩🦔🌼🌳\nColumn 10: 🚀🌼🌳🐋🐚🐫🐚🥀🌳🐋\n\nLet me check column 3 again:\n\nColumn 3 (top to bottom): 🥀🌳🐫🐫🐫🌳🌼🌳🐋🐫\n- 🐫🐫🐫 (positions 3-5): 1 line\n- 🌳🌳 (positions 2 and 6): Not a line because they're not consecutive.\n\nAh, I see I made an error in my previous analysis. Let me focus on looking at consecutive identical emojis in each row and column:\n\nLet's try again one more time for the vertical lines:\n\nColumn 1 (top to bottom): 🌼🐚🐋🦔🚀🥀🌳🐫🐚🌼\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 2 (top to bottom): 🐋🌳🥀🦩🥀🐚🦔🌳🥀🌳\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 3 (top to bottom): 🥀🌳🐫🐫🐫🌳🌼🌳🐋🐫\n- 🐫🐫🐫 (positions 3-5): 1 line\n- I incorrectly identified a line earlier.

It seems to be a 7x7 grid of emojis.\n\nLet me represent the board more clearly for my analysis:\n\nRow 1: 🦆🌈🦃🦀🦃🦀🦆\nRow 2: 🌑🦃☄️☄️🌈🦆🦃\nRow 3: 🦃🦆🦆🌈☄️☄️🌈\nRow 4: ☄️🦃🦆🌈🦀🌈🦀\nRow 5: ☄️🦃🦀🌑🦀🌑🦆\nRow 6: 🦃🌈🦆🌈🦆🦆🌈\nRow 7: 🦃🦆☄️🌑🦀🦀☄️\n\nLet's first scan for horizontal lines (rows) of the same emoji with length 2 or more:\n\nRow 1: None\nRow 2: ☄️☄️ (length 2)\nRow 3: 🦆🦆 (length 2), ☄️☄️ (length 2)\nRow 4: None\nRow 5: None\nRow 6: 🦆🦆 (length 2)\nRow 7: 🦀🦀 (length 2)\n\nHorizontal lines count: 5\n\nNow let's scan for vertical lines (columns) of the same emoji with length 2 or more:\n\nColumn 1: ☄️☄️ (length 2), 🦃🦃 (length 2)\nColumn 2: 🦃🦃🦃 (length 3)\nColumn 3: None\nColumn 4: 🌈🌈 (length 2)\nColumn 5: 🦀🦀 (length 2)\nColumn 6: 🦆🦆 (length 2)\nColumn 7: 🦃🦃 (length 2)\n\nHmm, let me double-check column 1 to make sure I'm counting correctly. From top to bottom:\n🦆, 🌑, 🦃, ☄️, ☄️, 🦃, 🦃\n\nOK, in column 1 I see:\n- ☄️☄️ (positions 4-5)\n- 🦃🦃 (positions 6-7)\n\nThis gives us 2 vertical lines in column 1.\n\nLet me also double-check column 2 to be thorough:\n🌈, 🦃, 🦆, 🦃, 🦃, 🌈, 🦆\n\nIn column 2 I see:\n- 🦃🦃🦃 (positions 2, 4, 5)\n\nWait, there's a gap in the 🦃 sequence in column 2. Let me check more carefully.\n\nColumn 2: 🌈, 🦃, 🦆, 🦃, 🦃, 🌈, 🦆\n\nActually, we have:\n- 🦃🦃 (positions 4-5)\n\nSo column 2 has 1 vertical line, not a line of length 3 as I incorrectly stated earlier.\n\nLet me systematically check all columns again to be certain:\n\nColumn 1 (top to bottom): 🦆, 🌑, 🦃, ☄️, ☄️, 🦃, 🦃\n- ☄️☄️ (positions 4-5)\n- 🦃🦃 (positions 6-7)\n\nColumn 2 (top to bottom): 🌈, 🦃, 🦆, 🦃, 🦃, 🌈, 🦆\n- 🦃🦃 (positions 4-5)\n\nColumn 3 (top to bottom): 🦃, ☄️, 🦆, 🦆, 🦀, 🦆, ☄️\n- 🦆🦆 (positions 3-4)\n\nColumn 4 (top to bottom): 🦀, ☄️, 🌈, 🌈, 🌑, 🌈, 🌑\n- ☄️☄️ (positions 2-3)\n- 🌈🌈 (positions 3-4)\n- 🌑🌑 (positions 5, 7) - wait, these aren't consecutive, so it's not a line\n\nActually, let's double-check. The emoji in row 3, column 4 is 🌈, and row 4, column 4 is also 🌈. So that's a line of 🌈🌈.\n\nThe emoji in row 5, column 4 is 🌑, but row 6, column 4 is 🌈, not 🌑. So there's no line of 🌑🌑 in column 4.\n\nCorrecting:\nColumn 4 (top to bottom): 🦀, ☄️, 🌈, 🌈, 🌑, 🌈, 🌑\n- ☄️☄️ (positions 2-3) - no, this is wrong, the emoji at position 2 is ☄️ but at position 3 is 🌈\n- 🌈🌈 (positions 3-4)\n\nActually, let's double-check again. Looking at column 4:\nRow 1, Column 4: 🦀\nRow 2, Column 4: ☄️\nRow 3, Column 4: 🌈\nRow 4, Column 4: 🌈\nRow 5, Column 4: 🌑\nRow 6, Column 4: 🌈\nRow 7, Column 4: 🌑\n\nSo in column 4, we have:\n- 🌈🌈 (rows 3-4)\n\nI think I've been making some errors.

no, this is incorrect, position 4 has 🌈, so we just have 🦆🦆 (positions 5-6) = 1 line\nRow 7: 🦀🦀 (positions 5-6), ☄️☄️ (positions 3, 7) - no, positions 3 and 7 are not consecutive, so just 🦀🦀 = 1 line\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 5\n\nNow for vertical lines:\n\nColumn 1:\n🦆 (row 1)\n🌑 (row 2)\n🦃 (row 3)\n☄️ (row 4)\n☄️ (row 5)\n🦃 (row 6)\n🦃 (row 7)\nVertical lines: ☄️☄️ (rows 4-5), 🦃🦃 (rows 6-7) = 2 lines\n\nColumn 2:\n🌈 (row 1)\n🦃 (row 2)\n🦆 (row 3)\n🦃 (row 4)\n🦃 (row 5)\n🌈 (row 6)\n🦆 (row 7)\nVertical lines: 🦃🦃 (rows 4-5) = 1 line\n\nColumn 3:\n🦃 (row 1)\n☄️ (row 2)\n🦆 (row 3)\n🦆 (row 4)\n🦀 (row 5)\n🦆 (row 6)\n☄️ (row 7)\nVertical lines: 🦆🦆 (rows 3-4) = 1 line\n\nColumn 4:\n🦀 (row 1)\n☄️ (row 2)\n🌈 (row 3)\n🌈 (row 4)\n🌑 (row 5)\n🌈 (row 6)\n🌑 (row 7)\nVertical lines: 🌈🌈 (rows 3-4) = 1 line\n\nColumn 5:\n🦃 (row 1)\n🌈 (row 2)\n☄️ (row 3)\n🦀 (row 4)\n🦀 (row 5)\n🦆 (row 6)\n🦀 (row 7)\nVertical lines: 🦀🦀 (rows 4-5) = 1 line\n\nColumn 6:\n🦀 (row 1)\n🦆 (row 2)\n☄️ (row 3)\n🌈 (row 4)\n🌑 (row 5)\n🦆 (row 6)\n🦀 (row 7)\nNo vertical lines\n\nColumn 7:\n🦆 (row 1)\n🦃 (row 2)\n🌈 (row 3)\n🦀 (row 4)\n🦆 (row 5)\n🌈 (row 6)\n☄️ (row 7)\nNo vertical lines\n\nTotal vertical lines: 6\n\nTherefore, the total number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more is: 5 + 6 = 11.\n\nWait, let me double-check my horizontal lines again. I think I made an error in how I reported row 6:\n\nRow 6: 🦃🌈🦆🌈🦆🦆🌈\nSo the horizontal lines in row 6 are: 🦆🦆 (positions 5-6) = 1 line\n\nI think I was correct: 5 horizontal lines.\n\nIn summary, there are 5 horizontal lines and 6 vertical lines, for a total of 11 lines.\n\nActually, let's double-check row 6 to be extra sure:\nRow 6: 🦃🌈🦆🌈🦆🦆🌈\n\nPosition 1: 🦃\nPosition 2: 🌈\nPosition 3: 🦆\nPosition 4: 🌈\nPosition 5: 🦆\nPosition 6: 🦆\nPosition 7: 🌈\n\nSo in row 6, we have:\n- 🦆🦆 (positions 5-6)\nSo there is indeed 1 horizontal line in row 6.\n\nAnd just to be totally certain about row 7:\nRow 7: 🦃🦆☄️🌑🦀🦀☄️\n\nPosition 1: 🦃\nPosition 2: 🦆\nPosition 3: ☄️\nPosition 4: 🌑\nPosition 5: 🦀\nPosition 6: 🦀\nPosition 7: ☄️\n\nSo in row 7, we have:\n- 🦀🦀 (positions 5-6)\n- There's also ☄️ at positions 3 and 7, but they are not consecutive, so they don't form a line.\nSo there is indeed 1 horizontal line in row 7.\n\nTherefore, my count of 5 horizontal lines is correct.\n\nSo the answer is 11 lines in total.# Counting Horizontal and Vertical Lines in the Emoji Board\n\nI'll carefully analyze the board to find all horizontal and vertical lines formed by the same emoji with a length of 2 or more.\n\n## The Board\n```\n🦆🌈🦃🦀🦃🦀🦆\n🌑🦃☄️☄️🌈🦆🦃\n🦃🦆🦆🌈☄️☄️🌈\n☄️🦃🦆🌈🦀🌈🦀\n☄️🦃🦀🌑🦀🌑🦆\n🦃🌈🦆🌈🦆🦆🌈\n🦃🦆☄️🌑🦀🦀☄️\n```\n\n## Horizontal Lines (same emoji in a row)\n1.

Let me create a matrix representation of the board and then check rows and columns methodically.\n\nLet me represent the emojis with letters for simplicity:\n- 🦀 = C (crab)\n- 🦥 = S (sloth)\n- 🥀 = F (flower)\n- 🐵 = M (monkey)\n- 🐫 = L (camel)\n- 🐴 = H (horse)\n\nNow, let me redraw the board:\n\n```\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\n0 C C C S F M C\n1 L F F M M L C\n2 M L C H M M L\n3 L M M H H M C\n4 F M H S F L L\n5 L S M C F M C\n6 M F H M F L S\n```\n\nNow, let's count the horizontal lines:\n\nRow 0: C C C (positions 0,0 to 0,2) - 1 line\nRow 1: F F (positions 1,1 to 1,2) and M M (positions 1,3 to 1,4) - 2 lines\nRow 2: M M (positions 2,4 to 2,5) - 1 line\nRow 3: M M (positions 3,1 to 3,2) and H H (positions 3,3 to 3,4) - 2 lines\nRow 4: L L (positions 4,5 to 4,6) - 1 line\nRow 5: No lines\nRow 6: No lines\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 7\n\nNow, let's count the vertical lines:\n\nColumn 0: L L (positions 3,0 to 4,0) and M M (positions 5,0 to 6,0) - actually, I made a mistake here. Let me double-check the board again.\n\nActually, I made a mistake in my representation. Let me use a different approach by directly analyzing the emoji board:\n\n```\n🦀🦀🦀🦥🥀🐵🦀\n🐫🥀🥀🐵🐵🐫🦀\n🐵🐫🦀🐴🐵🐵🐫\n🐫🐵🐵🐴🐴🐵🦀\n🥀🐵🐴🦥🥀🐫🐫\n🐫🦥🐵🦀🥀🐵🦀\n🐵🥀🐴🐵🥀🐫🦥\n```\n\nLet me count the horizontal lines first:\n\nRow 0: 🦀🦀🦀 (positions 0,0 to 0,2) - 1 line\nRow 1: 🥀🥀 (positions 1,1 to 1,2) and 🐵🐵 (positions 1,3 to 1,4) - 2 lines\nRow 2: 🐵🐵 (positions 2,4 to 2,5) - 1 line\nRow 3: 🐵🐵 (positions 3,1 to 3,2) and 🐴🐴 (positions 3,3 to 3,4) - 2 lines\nRow 4: 🐫🐫 (positions 4,5 to 4,6) - 1 line\nRow 5: No horizontal lines of length 2 or more\nRow 6: No horizontal lines of length 2 or more\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 7\n\nNow, let's count the vertical lines. I'll go column by column:\n\nColumn 0:\n- 🐫🐵 (positions 1,0 to 2,0) - These are different emojis\n- 🐵🐫 (positions 2,0 to 3,0) - Different emojis\n- 🐫🥀 (positions 3,0 to 4,0) - Different emojis\n- 🥀🐫 (positions 4,0 to 5,0) - Different emojis\n- 🐫🐵 (positions 5,0 to 6,0) - Different emojis\nNo lines of length 2 or more\n\nActually, this approach is still a bit error-prone for me. Let me try to visualize the board again but use a more systematic approach.\n\nI'll use a grid representation where rows are numbered 0-6 from top to bottom, and columns are numbered 0-6 from left to right. I'll organize the emojis in a table format:\n\n```\n    0    1    2    3    4    5    6\n0   🦀   🦀   🦀   🦥   🥀   🐵   🦀\n1   🐫   🥀   🥀   🐵   🐵   🐫   🦀\n2   🐵   🐫   🦀   🐴   🐵   🐵   🐫\n3   🐫   🐵   🐵   🐴   🐴   🐵   🦀\n4   🥀   🐵   🐴   🦥   🥀   🐫   🐫\n5   🐫   🦥   🐵   🦀   🥀   🐵   🦀\n6   🐵   🥀   🐴   🐵   🥀   🐫   🦥\n```\n\nNow, I'll check for horizontal lines of the same emoji with length 2 or more:\n\nRow 0: 🦀🦀🦀 at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) - 1 line\nRow 1: 🥀🥀 at (1,1), (1,2) and 🐵🐵 at (1,3), (1,4) - 2 lines\nRow 2: 🐵🐵 at (2,4), (2,5) - 1 line\nRow 3: 🐵🐵 at (3,1), (3,2) and 🐴🐴 at (3,3), (3,4) - 2 lines\nRow 4: 🐫🐫 at (4,5), (4,6) - 1 line\nRow 5: No horizontal lines\nRow 6: No horizontal lines\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 7\n\nNow, let's check for vertical lines of the same emoji with length 2 or more:\n\nColumn 0:\n- Row 0-1: 🦀 to 🐫 - Different emojis\n- Row 1-2: 🐫 to 🐵 - Different emojis\n- Row 2-3: 🐵 to 🐫 - Different emojis\n- Row 3-4: 🐫 to 🥀 - Different emojis\n- Row 4-5: 🥀 to 🐫 - Different emojis\n- Row 5-6: 🐫 to 🐵 - Different emojis\nNo vertical lines in column 0\n\nColumn 1:\n- Row 0-1: 🦀 to 🥀 - Different emojis\n- Row 1-2: 🥀 to 🐫 - Different emojis\n- Row 2-3: 🐫 to 🐵 - Different emojis\n- Row 3-4: 🐵 to 🐵 - Same emoji! 🐵🐵 at (3,1), (4,1) - 1 line\n- Row 4-5: 🐵 to 🦥 - Different emojis\n- Row 5-6: 🦥 to 🥀 - Different emojis\n\nColumn 2:\n- Row 0-1: 🦀 to 🥀 - Different emojis\n- Row 1-2: 🥀 to 🦀 - Different emojis\n- Row 2-3: 🦀 to 🐵 - Different emojis\n- Row 3-4: 🐵 to 🐴 - Different emojis\n- Row 4-5: 🐴 to 🐵 - Different emojis\n- Row 5-6: 🐵 to 🐴 - Different emojis\nNo vertical lines in column 2\n\nColumn 3:\n- Row 0-1: 🦥 to 🐵 - Different emojis\n- Row 1-2: 🐵 to 🐴 - Different emojis\n- Row 2-3: 🐴 to 🐴 - Same emoji! 🐴🐴 at (2,3), (3,3) - 1 line\n- Row 3-4: 🐴 to 🦥 - Different emojis\n- Row 4-5: 🦥 to 🦀 - Different emojis\n- Row 5-6: 🦀 to 🐵 - Different emojis\n\nColumn 4:\n- Row 0-1: 🥀 to 🐵 - Different emojis\n- Row 1-2: 🐵 to 🐵 - Same emoji! 🐵🐵 at (1,4), (2,4) - 1 line\n- Row 2-3: 🐵 to 🐴 - Different emojis\n- Row 3-4: 🐴 to 🥀 - Different emojis\n- Row 4-5: 🥀 to 🥀 - Same emoji! 🥀🥀 at (4,4), (5,4) - 1 line\n- Row 5-6: 🥀 to 🥀 - Same emoji! (With the above) 🥀🥀🥀 at (4,4), (5,4), (6,4) - This creates a line of length 3\n\nActually, I'm double-counting here. In column 4, if there's a line of 3 same emojis, I should count it as 1 line, not 2. Let me correct my approach and be more careful.\n\nLet me redo the vertical line counting:\n\nColumn 0:\nNo vertical lines of length 2 or more\n\nColumn 1:\n- 🐵🐵 at (3,1), (4,1) - 1 line\n\nColumn 2:\nNo vertical lines of length 2 or more\n\nColumn 3:\n- 🐴🐴 at (2,3), (3,3) - 1 line\n\nColumn 4:\n- 🐵🐵 at (1,4), (2,4) - 1 line\n- 🥀🥀 at (4,4), (5,4), (6,4) - wait, let me double-check this.\n\nI need to be more systematic. Let me create a table for each column:\n\nColumn 4:\n- Row 0: 🥀\n- Row 1: 🐵\n- Row 2: 🐵\n- Row 3: 🐴\n- Row 4: 🥀\n- Row 5: 🥀\n- Row 6: 🥀\n\nSo in column 4, we have:\n- 🐵🐵 at (1,4), (2,4) - 1 line\n- 🥀🥀🥀 at (4,4), (5,4), (6,4) - 1 line (not 2, since it's a single line of length 3)\n\nColumn 5:\n- Row 0: 🐵\n- Row 1: 🐫\n- Row 2: 🐵\n- Row 3: 🐵\n- Row 4: 🐫\n- Row 5: 🐵\n- Row 6: 🐫\n\nIn column 5, we have:\n- 🐵🐵 at (2,5), (3,5) - 1 line\n\nColumn 6:\n- Row 0: 🦀\n- Row 1: 🦀\n- Row 2: 🐫\n- Row 3: 🦀\n- Row 4: 🐫\n- Row 5: 🦀\n- Row 6: 🦥\n\nIn column 6, we have:\n- 🦀🦀 at (0,6), (1,6) - 1 line\n- 🐫🐫 at (2,6), (4,6) - wait, these are not contiguous. Let me recheck.\n\nColumn 6:\n- Row 0: 🦀\n- Row 1: 🦀\n- Row 2: 🐫\n- Row 3: 🦀\n- Row 4: 🐫\n- Row 5: 🦀\n- Row 6: 🦥\n\nSo in column 6, we have:\n- 🦀🦀 at (0,6), (1,6) - 1 line\n\nTotal vertical lines: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 7\nTotal vertical lines: 5\nTotal lines: 7 + 5 = 12\n\nActually, I think I'm confused in my counting. Let me redo this one more time to make sure I'm correct.\n\nHorizontal lines (of length 2 or more):\n\nRow 0:\n- 🦀🦀🦀 at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) - 1 line\n\nRow 1:\n- 🥀🥀 at (1,1), (1,2) - 1 line\n- 🐵🐵 at (1,3), (1,4) - 1 line\n\nRow 2:\n- 🐵🐵 at (2,4), (2,5) - 1 line\n\nRow 3:\n- 🐵🐵 at (3,1), (3,2) - 1 line\n- 🐴🐴 at (3,3), (3,4) - 1 line\n\nRow 4:\n- 🐫🐫 at (4,5), (4,6) - 1 line\n\nRow 5:\nNo horizontal lines of length 2 or more\n\nRow 6:\nNo horizontal lines of length 2 or more\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 7\n\nVertical lines (of length 2 or more):\n\nColumn 0:\nNo vertical lines of length 2 or more\n\nColumn 1:\n- 🐵🐵 at (3,1), (4,1) - 1 line\n\nColumn 2:\nNo vertical lines of length 2 or more\n\nColumn 3:\n- 🐴🐴 at (2,3), (3,3) - 1 line\n\nColumn 4:\n- 🐵🐵 at (1,4), (2,4) - 1 line\n- 🥀🥀🥀 at (4,4), (5,4), (6,4) - 1 line\n\nColumn 5:\n- 🐵🐵 at (2,5), (3,5) - 1 line\n\nColumn 6:\n- 🦀🦀 at (0,6), (1,6) - 1 line\n\nTotal vertical lines: 6\n\nTotal lines (horizontal + vertical): 7 + 6 = 13\n\nBut wait, I need to double-check my calculations in column 4 for rows 4-6, let me make sure I'm looking at the right emojis:\n\nColumn 4 (from the original board):\n- Row 0: 🥀\n- Row 1: 🐵\n- Row 2: 🐵\n- Row 3: 🐴\n- Row 4: 🥀\n- Row 5: 🥀\n- Row 6: 🥀\n\nYes, there's a vertical line of 3 🥀 emojis in column 4, rows 4-6.\n\nLet me double-check the entire board again:\n\n```\n    0    1    2    3    4    5    6\n0   🦀   🦀   🦀   🦥   🥀   🐵   🦀\n1   🐫   🥀   🥀   🐵   🐵   🐫   🦀\n2   🐵   🐫   🦀   🐴   🐵   🐵   🐫\n3   🐫   🐵   🐵   🐴   🐴   🐵   🦀\n4   🥀   🐵   🐴   🦥   🥀   🐫   🐫\n5   🐫   🦥   🐵   🦀   🥀   🐵   🦀\n6   🐵   🥀   🐴   🐵   🥀   🐫   🦥\n```\n\nHmm, there seems to be some confusion. Let me double-check my observations one more time:\n\nColumn 4 (emoji at position (row, 4)):\n- Row 0: 🥀\n- Row 1: 🐵\n- Row 2: 🐵\n- Row 3: 🐴\n- Row 4: 🥀\n- Row 5: 🥀\n- Row 6: 🥀\n\nYes, the emojis in column 4 are:\n- 🥀 (row 0)\n- 🐵 (row 1)\n- 🐵 (row 2)\n- 🐴 (row 3)\n- 🥀 (row 4)\n- 🥀 (row 5)\n- 🥀 (row 6)\n\nSo there's a vertical line of 2 🐵 emojis in rows 1-2 and a vertical line of 3 🥀 emojis in rows 4-6.\n\nBut I made a mistake in another part. Let me check column 0 again:\n\nColumn 0 (emoji at position (row, 0)):\n- Row 0: 🦀\n- Row 1: 🐫\n- Row 2: 🐵\n- Row 3: 🐫\n- Row 4: 🥀\n- Row 5: 🐫\n- Row 6: 🐵\n\nNo vertical lines of length 2 or more in column 0.\n\nColumn 1 (emoji at position (row, 1)):\n- Row 0: 🦀\n- Row 1: 🥀\n- Row 2: 🐫\n- Row 3: 🐵\n- Row 4: 🐵\n- Row 5: 🦥\n- Row 6: 🥀\n\nIn column 1, we have a vertical line of 2 🐵 emojis at positions (3,1) and (4,1).\n\nLet me continue to check all columns systematically:\n\nColumn 2 (emoji at position (row, 2)):\n- Row 0: 🦀\n- Row 1: 🥀\n- Row 2: 🦀\n- Row 3: 🐵\n- Row 4: 🐴\n- Row 5: 🐵\n- Row 6: 🐴\n\nNo vertical lines of length 2 or more in column 2.\n\nColumn 3 (emoji at position (row, 3)):\n- Row 0: 🦥\n- Row 1: 🐵\n- Row 2: 🐴\n- Row 3: 🐴\n- Row 4: 🦥\n- Row 5: 🦀\n- Row 6: 🐵\n\nIn column 3, we have a vertical line of 2 🐴 emojis at positions (2,3) and (3,3).\n\nColumn 4 (emoji at position (row, 4)):\n- Row 0: 🥀\n- Row 1: 🐵\n- Row 2: 🐵\n- Row 3: 🐴\n- Row 4: 🥀\n- Row 5: 🥀\n- Row 6: 🥀\n\nIn column 4, we have:\n- A vertical line of 2 🐵 emojis at positions (1,4) and (2,4)\n- A vertical line of 3 🥀 emojis at positions (4,4), (5,4), and (6,4)\n\nColumn 5 (emoji at position (row, 5)):\n- Row 0: 🐵\n- Row 1: 🐫\n- Row 2: 🐵\n- Row 3: 🐵\n- Row 4: 🐫\n- Row 5: 🐵\n- Row 6: 🐫\n\nIn column 5, we have a vertical line of 2 🐵 emojis at positions (2,5) and (3,5).\n\nColumn 6 (emoji at position (row, 6)):\n- Row 0: 🦀\n- Row 1: 🦀\n- Row 2: 🐫\n- Row 3: 🦀\n- Row 4: 🐫\n- Row 5: 🦀\n- Row 6: 🦥\n\nIn column 6, we have a vertical line of 2 🦀 emojis at positions (0,6) and (1,6).\n\nTotal vertical lines:\n- Column 1: 1 line\n- Column 3: 1 line\n- Column 4: 2 lines\n- Column 5: 1 line\n- Column 6: 1 line\n\nTotal vertical lines: 6\n\nTotal horizontal lines (from before): 7\n\nTotal lines (horizontal + vertical): 7 + 6 = 13\n\nBut actually, I need to re-check column 5 again.\n\nColumn 5 (emoji at position (row, 5)):\n- Row 0: 🐵\n- Row 1: 🐫\n- Row 2: 🐵\n- Row 3: 🐵\n- Row 4: 🐫\n- Row 5: 🐵\n- Row 6: 🐫\n\nLooking at column 5, I see:\n- 🐵 at (0,5)\n- 🐫 at (1,5)\n- 🐵 at (2,5)\n- 🐵 at (3,5)\n- 🐫 at (4,5)\n- 🐵 at (5,5)\n- 🐫 at (6,5)\n\nSo there's a vertical line of 2 🐵 emojis at positions (2,5) and (3,5). That's 1 line in column 5.\n\nLet me re-check column 6 as well:\n\nColumn 6 (emoji at position (row, 6)):\n- Row 0: 🦀\n- Row 1: 🦀\n- Row 2: 🐫\n- Row 3: 🦀\n- Row 4: 🐫\n- Row 5: 🦀\n- Row 6: 🦥\n\nLooking at column 6, I see:\n- 🦀 at (0,6)\n- 🦀 at (1,6)\n- 🐫 at (2,6)\n- 🦀 at (3,6)\n- 🐫 at (4,6)\n- 🦀 at (5,6)\n- 🦥 at (6,6)\n\nThere's a vertical line of 2 🦀 emojis at positions (0,6) and (1,6). That's 1 line in column 6.\n\nLet me check if there are any other vertical lines:\n\nColumn 5 again:\n- 🐫🐫 at (4,5) and (6,5) are not contiguous, so they don't form a line\n- 🐵🐵 at (5,5) and (3,5) are not contiguous, so they don't form a line\n\nColumn 6 again:\n- 🦀🦀 at (3,6) and (5,6) are not contiguous, so they don't form a line\n- 🐫🐫 at (2,6) and (4,6) are not contiguous, so they don't form a line\n\nSo, the total vertical lines: 6\n\nActually, let me double-check horizontal lines again as well to make sure I didn't make any mistakes:\n\nRow 0:\n- 🦀🦀🦀 at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) - 1 line\n\nRow 1:\n- 🥀🥀 at (1,1), (1,2) - 1 line\n- 🐵🐵 at (1,3), (1,4) - 1 line\n\nRow 2:\n- 🐵🐵 at (2,4), (2,5) - 1 line\n\nRow 3:\n- 🐵🐵 at (3,1), (3,2) - 1 line\n- 🐴🐴 at (3,3), (3,4) - 1 line\n\nRow 4:\n- 🐫🐫 at (4,5), (4,6) - 1 line\n\nRow 5:\nNo horizontal lines of length 2 or more\n\nRow 6:\nNo horizontal lines of length 2 or more\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 7\n\nNow, let me summarize:\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 7\nTotal vertical lines: 6\nTotal lines (horizontal + vertical): 7 + 6 = 13\n\nBut wait, I think I made a mistake again. Let me look at row 4 in the original board:\n\nRow 4:\n- 🥀🐵🐴🦥🥀🐫🐫\n\nYes, there's a horizontal line of 2 🐫 emojis at positions (4,5) and (4,6).\n\nLet me look at row 5:\n\nRow 5:\n- 🐫🦥🐵🦀🥀🐵🦀\n\nNo horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nLet me check row 6:\n\nRow 6:\n- 🐵🥀🐴🐵🥀🐫🦥\n\nNo horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nI think my final answer is correct:\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 7\nTotal vertical lines: 6\nTotal lines (horizontal + vertical): 7 + 6 = 13# Solving the Emoji Line Count Problem\n\nI need to count horizontal or vertical lines of the same emoji that are 2 or more in length.\n\nFirst, let me represent the board clearly:\n```\n🦀🦀🦀🦥🥀🐵🦀\n🐫🥀🥀🐵🐵🐫🦀\n🐵🐫🦀🐴🐵🐵🐫\n🐫🐵🐵🐴🐴🐵🦀\n🥀🐵🐴🦥🥀🐫🐫\n🐫🦥🐵🦀🥀🐵🦀\n🐵🥀🐴🐵🥀🐫🦥\n```\n\n## Horizontal Lines\n\nRow 0: 🦀🦀🦀 (3 crabs) - 1 line\nRow 1: 🥀🥀 (2 flowers) and 🐵🐵 (2 monkeys) - 2 lines\nRow 2: 🐵🐵 (2 monkeys) - 1 line\nRow 3: 🐵🐵 (2 monkeys) and 🐴🐴 (2 horses) - 2 lines\nRow 4: 🐫🐫 (2 camels) - 1 line\nRow 5: No horizontal lines\nRow 6: No horizontal lines\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 7\n\n## Vertical Lines\n\nColumn 0: No vertical lines\nColumn 1: 🐵🐵 (2 monkeys in rows 3-4) - 1 line\nColumn 3: 🐴🐴 (2 horses in rows 2-3) - 1 line\nColumn 4:\n- 🐵🐵 (2 monkeys in rows 1-2) - 1 line\n- 🥀🥀🥀 (3 flowers in rows 4-6) - 1 line\nColumn 5: 🐵🐵 (2 monkeys in rows 2-3) - 1 line\nColumn 6: 🦀🦀 (2 crabs in rows 0-1) - 1 line\n\nTotal vertical lines: 6\n\n## Total Count\nTotal lines = Horizontal + Vertical = 7 + 6 = 13\n\nAnswer: 13"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Let me carefully analyze the board.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the horizontal lines row by row:\n\nRow 1: `🌙🌙🐨🐋🌼🌼`\n- 🌙🌙 (length 2)\n- 🌼🌼 (length 2)\nSo row 1 has 2 lines.\n\nRow 2: `🌙🌼🐋🐨🐋🌙`\nNo consecutive same emojis. 0 lines.\n\nRow 3: `🐨🌼🌙🐋🌼🌙`\nNo consecutive same emojis. 0 lines.\n\nRow 4: `🌼🐋🌼🐋🌙🐨`\nNo consecutive same emojis. 0 lines.\n\nRow 5: `🌼🌙🌙🐨🌼🐋`\n- 🌙🌙 (length 2)\nSo row 5 has 1 line.\n\nRow 6: `🐨🌙🌼🐨🐋🌼`\nNo consecutive same emojis. 0 lines.\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 3\n\nNow, let's analyze the vertical lines column by column:\n\nColumn 1: `🌙🌙🐨🌼🌼🐨`\n- 🌙🌙 (length 2)\n- 🌼🌼 (length 2)\nSo column 1 has 2 lines.\n\nColumn 2: `🌙🌼🌼🐋🌙🌙`\n- 🌙🌙 (length 2)\nSo column 2 has 1 line.\n\nColumn 3: `🐨🐋🌙🌼🌙🌼`\nNo consecutive same emojis. 0 lines.\n\nColumn 4: `🐋🐨🐋🐋🐨🐨`\n- 🐋🐋 (length 2)\n- 🐨🐨 (length 2)\nSo column 4 has 2 lines.\n\nColumn 5: `🌼🐋🌼🌙🌼🐋`\nNo consecutive same emojis. 0 lines.\n\nColumn 6: `🌼🌙🌙🐨🐋🌼`\n- 🌙🌙 (length 2)\nSo column 6 has 1 line.\n\nActually, I think I made a mistake in how I'm collecting the columns.

Let me try to arrange the columns again.\n\nRow 1: `🌙🌙🐨🐋🌼🌼`\nRow 2: `🌙🌼🐋🐨🐋🌙`\nRow 3: `🐨🌼🌙🐋🌼🌙`\nRow 4: `🌼🐋🌼🐋🌙🐨`\nRow 5: `🌼🌙🌙🐨🌼🐋`\nRow 6: `🐨🌙🌼🐨🐋🌼`\n\nColumn 1: \n🌙 (Row 1)\n🌙 (Row 2)\n🐨 (Row 3)\n🌼 (Row 4)\n🌼 (Row 5)\n🐨 (Row 6)\n\nI see a sequence of 🌙🌙 (length 2) at the top, and a sequence of 🌼🌼 (length 2) in the middle. So column 1 has 2 lines.\n\nColumn 2:\n🌙 (Row 1)\n🌼 (Row 2)\n🌼 (Row 3)\n🐋 (Row 4)\n🌙 (Row 5)\n🌙 (Row 6)\n\nI see a sequence of 🌼🌼 (length 2) and a sequence of 🌙🌙 (length 2). So column 2 has 2 lines.\n\nActually, it seems a bit error-prone for me to do it this way. Let me try a different approach. I'll create a 2D array representing the board, and then I'll scan through it row by row and column by column to count the lines.\n\nLet's represent the board as a 2D array using simplified symbols (to make it easier to work with):\n```\nM M K W F F\nM F W K W M\nK F M W F M\nF W F W M K\nF M M K F W\nK M F K W F\n```\nwhere:\n- M represents 🌙\n- F represents 🌼\n- K represents 🐨\n- W represents 🐋\n\nNow, let's scan for horizontal lines:\n\nRow 1: `M M K W F F`\n- M M (length 2)\n- F F (length 2)\nSo row 1 has 2 lines.\n\nRow 2: `M F W K W M`\nNo consecutive same symbols. 0 lines.\n\nRow 3: `K F M W F M`\nNo consecutive same symbols. 0 lines.\n\nRow 4: `F W F W M K`\nNo consecutive same symbols. 0 lines.\n\nRow 5: `F M M K F W`\n- M M (length 2)\nSo row 5 has 1 line.\n\nRow 6: `K M F K W F`\nNo consecutive same symbols. 0 lines.\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 3\n\nNow, let's scan for vertical lines:\n\nColumn 1:\n```\nM\nM\nK\nF\nF\nK\n```\n- M M (length 2)\n- F F (length 2)\nSo column 1 has 2 lines.\n\nColumn 2:\n```\nM\nF\nF\nW\nM\nM\n```\n- F F (length 2)\n- M M (length 2)\nSo column 2 has 2 lines.\n\nColumn 3:\n```\nK\nW\nM\nF\nM\nF\n```\nNo consecutive same symbols. 0 lines.\n\nColumn 4:\n```\nW\nK\nW\nW\nK\nK\n```\n- W W (length 2)\n- K K (length 2)\nSo column 4 has 2 lines.\n\nColumn 5:\n```\nF\nW\nF\nM\nF\nW\n```\nNo consecutive same symbols. 0 lines.\n\nColumn 6:\n```\nF\nM\nM\nK\nW\nF\n```\n- M M (length 2)\nSo column 6 has 1 line.\n\nTotal vertical lines: 2 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 1 = 7\n\nTotal number of horizontal and vertical lines: 3 + 7 = 10\n\nActually, I think I'm still making mistakes. Let me go row by row and column by column again more carefully:\n\nRow 1: `🌙🌙🐨🐋🌼🌼`\nThere's a line of 2 🌙s and a line of 2 🌼s, so 2 lines.\n\nRow 2: `🌙🌼🐋🐨🐋🌙`\nNo consecutive same emojis. 0 lines.\n\nRow 3: `🐨🌼🌙🐋🌼🌙`\nNo consecutive same emojis. 0 lines.\n\nRow 4: `🌼🐋🌼🐋🌙🐨`\nNo consecutive same emojis. 0 lines.\n\nRow 5: `🌼🌙🌙🐨🌼🐋`\nThere's a line of 2 🌙s, so 1 line.\n\nRow 6: `🐨🌙🌼🐨🐋🌼`\nNo consecutive same emojis. 0 lines.\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 3\n\nNow for the columns. I need to be very careful here.\n\nColumn 1:\n```\n🌙 (Row 1)\n🌙 (Row 2)\n🐨 (Row 3)\n🌼 (Row 4)\n🌼 (Row 5)\n🐨 (Row 6)\n```\nI see a sequence of 2 🌙s at positions 1 and 2, and a sequence of 2 🌼s at positions 4 and 5. So column 1 has 2 lines.\n\nColumn 2:\n```\n🌙 (Row 1)\n🌼 (Row 2)\n🌼 (Row 3)\n🐋 (Row 4)\n🌙 (Row 5)\n🌙 (Row 6)\n```\nI see a sequence of 2 🌼s at positions 2 and 3, and a sequence of 2 🌙s at positions 5 and 6. So column 2 has 2 lines.\n\nColumn 3:\n```\n🐨 (Row 1)\n🐋 (Row 2)\n🌙 (Row 3)\n🌼 (Row 4)\n🌙 (Row 5)\n🌼 (Row 6)\n```\nNo consecutive same emojis. 0 lines.\n\nColumn 4:\n```\n🐋 (Row 1)\n🐨 (Row 2)\n🐋 (Row 3)\n🐋 (Row 4)\n🐨 (Row 5)\n🐨 (Row 6)\n```\nI see a sequence of 2 🐋s at positions 3 and 4, and a sequence of 2 🐨s at positions 5 and 6. So column 4 has 2 lines.\n\nColumn 5:\n```\n🌼 (Row 1)\n🐋 (Row 2)\n🌼 (Row 3)\n🌙 (Row 4)\n🌼 (Row 5)\n🐋 (Row 6)\n```\nNo consecutive same emojis. 0 lines.\n\nColumn 6:\n```\n🌼 (Row 1)\n🌙 (Row 2)\n🌙 (Row 3)\n🐨 (Row 4)\n🐋 (Row 5)\n🌼 (Row 6)\n```\nThere's a line of 2 🌙s at positions 2 and 3. So column 6 has 1 line.\n\nTotal vertical lines: 2 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 1 = 7\n\nTotal number of horizontal and vertical lines: 3 + 7 = 10\n\nHmm, that still doesn't seem right for column 6.\n\nLet me restate the board once more to make sure I'm looking at it correctly:\n\n```\n🌙🌙🐨🐋🌼🌼\n🌙🌼🐋🐨🐋🌙\n🐨🌼🌙🐋🌼🌙\n🌼🐋🌼🐋🌙🐨\n🌼🌙🌙🐨🌼🐋\n🐨🌙🌼🐨🐋🌼\n```\n\nColumn 6 (the last column) should be:\n```\n🌼 (Row 1)\n🌙 (Row 2)\n🌙 (Row 3)\n🐨 (Row 4)\n🐋 (Row 5)\n🌼 (Row 6)\n```\n\nLooking at this, I don't see 2 consecutive 🌙s. Let me double-check all the columns:\n\nColumn 1:\n```\n🌙 (Row 1)\n🌙 (Row 2)\n🐨 (Row 3)\n🌼 (Row 4)\n🌼 (Row 5)\n🐨 (Row 6)\n```\nI see 2 consecutive 🌙s (positions 1-2) and 2 consecutive 🌼s (positions 4-5).

Let me trace through row 4 carefully:\n```\n🦜 (Column 1)\n🕷 (Column 2)\n🐥 (Column 3)\n🐥 (Column 4)\n🐥 (Column 5)\n🎁 (Column 6)\n🦐 (Column 7)\n```\nThe 🐥 emojis are at positions 3, 4, and 5. So yes, there's a line of 3 🐥 emojis.\n\nRow 5: 🎁🦜🦐🦐🐥🕷🐥\nLet me trace through row 5 carefully:\n```\n🎁 (Column 1)\n🦜 (Column 2)\n🦐 (Column 3)\n🦐 (Column 4)\n🐥 (Column 5)\n🕷 (Column 6)\n🐥 (Column 7)\n```\nThere's a line of 2 🦐 emojis (Columns 3-4).\nThat's 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow 6: 🦐🎁🦐🦜🦃🎁🦐\nLet me trace through row 6 carefully:\n```\n🦐 (Column 1)\n🎁 (Column 2)\n🦐 (Column 3)\n🦜 (Column 4)\n🦃 (Column 5)\n🎁 (Column 6)\n🦐 (Column 7)\n```\nNo horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 7: 🐥🎁🕷🦃🕷🦃🕷\nLet me trace through row 7 carefully:\n```\n🐥 (Column 1)\n🎁 (Column 2)\n🕷 (Column 3)\n🦃 (Column 4)\n🕷 (Column 5)\n🦃 (Column 6)\n🕷 (Column 7)\n```\n\nNo horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nWait, I need to look more carefully at row 7:\n```\n🐥 (Column 1)\n🎁 (Column 2)\n🕷 (Column 3)\n🦃 (Column 4)\n🕷 (Column 5)\n🦃 (Column 6)\n🕷 (Column 7)\n```\n\nThere are 🕷 emojis at positions 3, 5, and 7, but they are not consecutive. So no valid horizontal lines in row 7.\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 4\n\nTotal lines (horizontal + vertical): 4 + 7 = 11\n\nSo there are 11 lines in total.\n\nWait, actually let's double-check column 3 again:\n\nColumn 3:\n```\n🦃 (Row 1)\n🐥 (Row 2)\n🦐 (Row 3)\n🐥 (Row 4)\n🦐 (Row 5)\n🦐 (Row 6)\n🕷 (Row 7)\n```\n\nThe 🦐 emojis are at positions 3, 5, and 6. Positions 5 and 6 form a valid line of length 2. So there's 1 vertical line in this column.\n\nSo the final count is still 11 lines.\n\nAnd finally, let me also check row 1 again, just to be very sure:\n\nRow 1: 🦐🦃🦃🕷🦃🐥🎁\nThe 🦃 emojis are at positions 2, 3, and 5. Positions 2 and 3 form a valid line of length 2. So there's 1 horizontal line in this row.\n\nSo there are 11 lines in total.\n\nActually, wait. I realized that I should be more careful about this problem. Let me clarify what counts as a \"line\" of length 2 or more.\n\nA line is a sequence of the same emoji, either horizontally or vertically, with a length of 2 or more. The line must be continuous, with no gaps.\n\nLet me trace through each row and column carefully one more time, focusing on continuous sequences of the same emoji.\n\nRow 1: 🦐🦃🦃🕷🦃🐥🎁\n- There's a continuous sequence of 2 🦃 emojis (positions 2-3).\n- Total horizontal lines in this row: 1\n\nRow 2: 🦐🐥🐥🐥🐥🐥🕷\n- There's a continuous sequence of 5 🐥 emojis (positions 2-6).\n- Total horizontal lines in this row: 1\n\nRow 3: 🦃🐥🦐🐥🦃🦐🎁\n- No continuous sequences of 2 or more of the same emoji.\n- Total horizontal lines in this row: 0\n\nRow 4: 🦜🕷🐥🐥🐥🎁🦐\n- There's a continuous sequence of 3 🐥 emojis (positions 3-5).\n- Total horizontal lines in this row: 1\n\nRow 5: 🎁🦜🦐🦐🐥🕷🐥\n- There's a continuous sequence of 2 🦐 emojis (positions 3-4).\n- Total horizontal lines in this row: 1\n\nRow 6: 🦐🎁🦐🦜🦃🎁🦐\n- No continuous sequences of 2 or more of the same emoji.\n- Total horizontal lines in this row: 0\n\nRow 7: 🐥🎁🕷🦃🕷🦃🕷\n- No continuous sequences of 2 or more of the same emoji.\n- Total horizontal lines in this row: 0\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 4\n\nColumn 1: 🦐🦐🦃🦜🎁🦐🐥\n- There's a continuous sequence of 2 🦐 emojis (positions 1-2).\n- Total vertical lines in this column: 1\n\nColumn 2: 🦃🐥🐥🕷🦜🎁🎁\n- There's a continuous sequence of 2 🐥 emojis (positions 2-3).\n- There's a continuous sequence of 2 🎁 emojis (positions 6-7).\n- Total vertical lines in this column: 2\n\nColumn 3: 🦃🐥🦐🐥🦐🦐🕷\n- There's a continuous sequence of 2 🦐 emojis (positions 5-6).\n- Total vertical lines in this column: 1\n\nColumn 4: 🕷🐥🐥🐥🦐🦜🦃\n- There's a continuous sequence of 3 🐥 emojis (positions 2-4).\n- Total vertical lines in this column: 1\n\nColumn 5: 🦃🐥🦃🐥🐥🦃🕷\n- There's a continuous sequence of 2 🐥 emojis (positions 4-5).\n- Total vertical lines in this column: 1\n\nColumn 6: 🐥🐥🦐🎁🕷🎁🦃\n- There's a continuous sequence of 2 🐥 emojis (positions 1-2).\n- Total vertical lines in this column: 1\n\nColumn 7: 🎁🕷🎁🦐🐥🦐🕷\n- No continuous sequences of 2 or more of the same emoji.\n- Total vertical lines in this column: 0\n\nTotal vertical lines: 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 7\n\nTotal lines (horizontal + vertical): 4 + 7 = 11\n\nActually, let's be sure about what I'm doing. I'll recheck the problem statement.\n\nOk I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more. So I need to count each line. For example, a sequence of 5 🐥 emojis counts as 1 line, not 4 lines (which would be the number of pairs you could form with 5 emojis).\n\nSo my count of 11 lines is correct.\n\nLet me double check column 4:\n```\n🕷 (Row 1)\n🐥 (Row 2)\n🐥 (Row 3)\n🐥 (Row 4)\n🦐 (Row 5)\n🦜 (Row 6)\n🦃 (Row 7)\n```\nThere's a continuous sequence of 3 🐥 emojis (Rows 2-4). That's 1 vertical line.\n\nLet me double check column 5:\n```\n🦃 (Row 1)\n🐥 (Row 2)\n🦃 (Row 3)\n🐥 (Row 4)\n🐥 (Row 5)\n🦃 (Row 6)\n🕷 (Row 7)\n```\nThere's a continuous sequence of 2 🐥 emojis (Rows 4-5). That's 1 vertical line.\n\nLet me double check column 6:\n```\n🐥 (Row 1)\n🐥 (Row 2)\n🦐 (Row 3)\n🎁 (Row 4)\n🕷 (Row 5)\n🎁 (Row 6)\n🦃 (Row 7)\n```\nThere's a continuous sequence of 2 🐥 emojis (Rows 1-2). That's 1 vertical line.\n\nSo I've triple-checked and my answer is 11.\n\nTo be explicit:\n- Horizontal lines: 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 4\n- Vertical lines: 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 7\n- Total: 4 + 7 = 11\n\nSo my final answer is 11.# Counting Lines of Same Emojis\n\nI need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\n\nLet me analyze the board row by row and column by column.\n\n## Horizontal Lines\n\nRow 1: 🦐🦃🦃🕷🦃🐥🎁\n- 1 line: 2 consecutive 🦃 emojis (positions 2-3)\n\nRow 2: 🦐🐥🐥🐥🐥🐥🕷\n- 1 line: 5 consecutive 🐥 emojis (positions 2-6)\n\nRow 3: 🦃🐥🦐🐥🦃🦐🎁\n- No consecutive same emojis\n\nRow 4: 🦜🕷🐥🐥🐥🎁🦐\n- 1 line: 3 consecutive 🐥 emojis (positions 3-5)\n\nRow 5: 🎁🦜🦐🦐🐥🕷🐥\n- 1 line: 2 consecutive 🦐 emojis (positions 3-4)\n\nRow 6: 🦐🎁🦐🦜🦃🎁🦐\n- No consecutive same emojis\n\nRow 7: 🐥🎁🕷🦃🕷🦃🕷\n- No consecutive same emojis\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 4\n\n## Vertical Lines\n\nColumn 1: 🦐🦐🦃🦜🎁🦐🐥\n- 1 line: 2 consecutive 🦐 emojis (rows 1-2)\n\nColumn 2: 🦃🐥🐥🕷🦜🎁🎁\n- 1 line: 2 consecutive 🐥 emojis (rows 2-3)\n- 1 line: 2 consecutive 🎁 emojis (rows 6-7)\n\nColumn 3: 🦃🐥🦐🐥🦐🦐🕷\n- 1 line: 2 consecutive 🦐 emojis (rows 5-6)\n\nColumn 4: 🕷🐥🐥🐥🦐🦜🦃\n- 1 line: 3 consecutive 🐥 emojis (rows 2-4)\n\nColumn 5: 🦃🐥🦃🐥🐥🦃🕷\n- 1 line: 2 consecutive 🐥 emojis (rows 4-5)\n\nColumn 6: 🐥🐥🦐🎁🕷🎁🦃\n- 1 line: 2 consecutive 🐥 emojis (rows 1-2)\n\nColumn 7: 🎁🕷🎁🦐🐥🦐🕷\n- No consecutive same emojis\n\nTotal vertical lines: 7\n\n## Total Count\nHorizontal lines (4) + Vertical lines (7) = 11\n\nAnswer: 11"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Let me visualize the board again with positions to make it clearer:\n\nRow 1 (top to bottom): ⛅️🦟🌰🌈🌾😃🦚🐑😃🦚\nRow 2: 🦚🐊🌾⛅️🦚🌰🌈⛅️😃⛅️\nRow 3: 🦉🐊🐊😃⛅️🦉🐊😃🦉🦟\nRow 4: 🌾🐊🌾😃🌾😃🐑🦚🌾🐊\nRow 5: 😃⛅️🌈🌾⛅️🌈🐊🐊🦟🌾\nRow 6: ⛅️🦚🌰🌾🌰⛅️🌈🐑🌰🐊\nRow 7: 😃⛅️😃🐊⛅️🌈🦚🦚🌈🌾\nRow 8: 🌾🦉🌰🌈🦚🦉🌈🌾⛅️😃\nRow 9: 🐊🦚🌈🌰🌾🦟🌰🌈🌈⛅️\nRow 10: 🦟⛅️🌈🦟🐑🐊😃🐊🌈🌾\n\nColumn 1: ⛅️🦚🦉🌾😃⛅️😃🌾🐊🦟\nColumn 2: 🦟🐊🐊🐊⛅️🦚⛅️🦉🦚⛅️\nColumn 3: 🌰🌾🐊🌾🌈🌰😃🌰🌈🌈\nColumn 4: 🌈⛅️😃😃🌾🌾🐊🌈🌰🦟\nColumn 5: 🌾🦚⛅️🌾⛅️🌰⛅️🦚🌾🐑\nColumn 6: 😃🌰🦉😃🌈⛅️🌈🦉🦟🐊\nColumn 7: 🦚🌈🐊🐑🐊🌈🦚🌈🌰😃\nColumn 8: 🐑⛅️😃🦚🐊🐑🦚🌾🌈🐊\nColumn 9: 😃😃🦉🌾🦟🌰🌈⛅️🌈🌈\nColumn 10: 🦚⛅️🦟🐊🌾🐊🌾😃⛅️🌾\n\nLet me count the horizontal lines again:\n\nRow 1: No horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\nRow 2: No horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\nRow 3: 🐊🐊 at positions 2-3 (length 2)\nRow 4: No horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\nRow 5: 🐊🐊 at positions 7-8 (length 2)\nRow 6: No horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\nRow 7: 🦚🦚 at positions 7-8 (length 2)\nRow 8: No horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\nRow 9: 🌈🌈 at positions 8-9 (length 2)\nRow 10: No horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nThat's 4 horizontal lines.\n\nNow, let me count the vertical lines again:\n\nColumn 1: No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\nColumn 2: 🐊🐊🐊 at positions 2-3-4 (length 3)\nColumn 3: 🌈🌈 at positions 9-10 (length 2)\nColumn 4: 😃😃 at positions 3-4 (length 2), 🌾🌾 at positions 5-6 (length 2)\nColumn 5: ⛅️⛅️⛅️ at positions 3-5-7 (length 3)\nColumn 6: 😃😃 at positions 1-4 (length 2), 🌈🌈 at positions 5-7 (length 2), 🦉🦉 at positions 3-8 (length 2)\nColumn 7: 🐊🐊 at positions 3-5 (length 2), 🌈🌈 at positions 2-6 or 6-8 (need to check)\nColumn 8: 🦚🦚 at positions 4-7 (length 2), 🐊🐊 at positions 5-10 (length 2)\nColumn 9: 😃😃 at positions 1-2 (length 2), 🌈🌈🌈 at positions 7-9-10 (length 3)\nColumn 10: 🐊🐊 at positions 4-6 (length 2), 🌾🌾 at positions 5-7 (length 2)\n\nThere seems to be some inconsistency in my earlier counting. Let me verify column 7:\n\nColumn 7: 🦚🌈🐊🐑🐊🌈🦚🌈🌰😃\n- I see 🐊 at positions 3 and 5, which gives a line of length 2.\n- I see 🌈 at positions 2, 6, and 8.\n- I see 🦚 at positions 1 and 7.\n\nSo, for column 7, we have 1 line of length 2 (🐊🐊) and no continuous lines of 🌈. There was an error in my earlier counting.\n\nLet me verify column 8:\n\nColumn 8: 🐑⛅️😃🦚🐊🐑🦚🌾🌈🐊\n- I see 🦚 at positions 4 and 7, which gives a line of length 2.\n- I see 🐊 at positions 5 and 10, but they're not continuous, so it's not a line.\n- I see 🐑 at positions 1 and 6, but they're not continuous, so it's not a line.\n\nSo, for column 8, we have 1 line of length 2 (🦚🦚) and no continuous line of 🐊. There was an error in my earlier counting.\n\nFor column 9, let's verify:\nColumn 9: 😃😃🦉🌾🦟🌰🌈⛅️🌈🌈\n- I see 😃 at positions 1 and 2, which gives a line of length 2.\n- I see 🌈 at positions 7, 9, and 10, but only positions 9 and 10 are continuous, which gives a line of length 2.\n\nSo, for column 9, we have 2 lines of length 2 (😃😃 and 🌈🌈).\n\nFor column 10, let's verify:\nColumn 10: 🦚⛅️🦟🐊🌾🐊🌾😃⛅️🌾\n- I see 🐊 at positions 4 and 6, but they're not continuous, so it's not a line.\n- I see 🌾 at positions 5, 7, and 10, but they're not continuous, so it's not a line.\n- I see ⛅️ at positions 2 and 9, but they're not continuous, so it's not a line.\n\nSo, for column 10, we have no lines of length 2 or more.\n\nLet me count the vertical lines once more:\n\nColumn 1: No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\nColumn 2: 🐊🐊🐊 at positions 2-3-4 (length 3)\nColumn 3: 🌈🌈 at positions 9-10 (length 2)\nColumn 4: 😃😃 at positions 3-4 (length 2), 🌾🌾 at positions 5-6 (length 2)\nColumn 5: ⛅️⛅️⛅️ at positions 3-5-7 (length 3)\nColumn 6: 😃😃 at positions 1-4 (length 2), 🌈🌈 at positions 5-7 (length 2), 🦉🦉 at positions 3-8 (length 2)\nColumn 7: 🐊🐊 at positions 3-5 (length 2)\nColumn 8: 🦚🦚 at positions 4-7 (length 2)\nColumn 9: 😃😃 at positions 1-2 (length 2), 🌈🌈 at positions 9-10 (length 2)\nColumn 10: No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nThat's 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 0 = 12 vertical lines.\n\nSo, the total number of horizontal and vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more is 4 + 12 = 16.\n\nActually, I think there's still a miscounting. Let me double-check all columns:\n\nColumn 1 (top to bottom): ⛅️🦚🦉🌾😃⛅️😃🌾🐊🦟\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 2 (top to bottom): 🦟🐊🐊🐊⛅️🦚⛅️🦉🦚⛅️\n- 🐊🐊🐊 at positions 2-3-4 (length 3)\n- No other vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 3 (top to bottom): 🌰🌾🐊🌾🌈🌰😃🌰🌈🌈\n- 🌈🌈 at positions 9-10 (length 2)\n- No other vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 4 (top to bottom): 🌈⛅️😃😃🌾🌾🐊🌈🌰🦟\n- 😃😃 at positions 3-4 (length 2)\n- 🌾🌾 at positions 5-6 (length 2)\n- No other vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 5 (top to bottom): 🌾🦚⛅️🌾⛅️🌰⛅️🦚🌾🐑\n- ⛅️⛅️⛅️ at positions 3-5-7 (length 3, non-continuous) or ⛅️⛅️ at position 3-5 and ⛅️ at position 7\n- Wait, I misinterpreted the requirement. A line in the context of this problem means a row of the same emoji in a horizontal or vertical line. So 🌾🦚⛅️ is not a line because the emojis are not the same. But ⛅️⛅️ is a line of length 2. ⛅️⛅️⛅️ would be a line of length 3 if the 3 emojis are in a row. Let me check all columns again.\n\nColumn 1 (top to bottom): ⛅️🦚🦉🌾😃⛅️😃🌾🐊🦟\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 2 (top to bottom): 🦟🐊🐊🐊⛅️🦚⛅️🦉🦚⛅️\n- 🐊🐊🐊 at positions 2-3-4 (length 3)\n- No other vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 3 (top to bottom): 🌰🌾🐊🌾🌈🌰😃🌰🌈🌈\n- 🌈🌈 at positions 9-10 (length 2)\n- No other vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 4 (top to bottom): 🌈⛅️😃😃🌾🌾🐊🌈🌰🦟\n- 😃😃 at positions 3-4 (length 2)\n- 🌾🌾 at positions 5-6 (length 2)\n- No other vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 5 (top to bottom): 🌾🦚⛅️🌾⛅️🌰⛅️🦚🌾🐑\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 6 (top to bottom): 😃🌰🦉😃🌈⛅️🌈🦉🦟🐊\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 7 (top to bottom): 🦚🌈🐊🐑🐊🌈🦚🌈🌰😃\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 8 (top to bottom): 🐑⛅️😃🦚🐊🐑🦚🌾🌈🐊\n- 🦚🦚 at positions 4-7 (length 2)\n- No other vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 9 (top to bottom): 😃😃🦉🌾🦟🌰🌈⛅️🌈🌈\n- 😃😃 at positions 1-2 (length 2)\n- 🌈🌈 at positions 9-10 (length 2)\n- No other vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 10 (top to bottom): 🦚⛅️🦟🐊🌾🐊🌾😃⛅️🌾\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nSo we have 1 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 0 = 7 vertical lines.\n\nAnd combined with the 4 horizontal lines, we have a total of 11 lines.\n\nActually, let me be even more careful and double-check both horizontal and vertical lines again. I am specifically looking for consecutive (adjacent) emojis of the same type in a horizontal or vertical line.\n\nRow 1 (horizontal, left to right): ⛅️🦟🌰🌈🌾😃🦚🐑😃🦚\n- No horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 2 (horizontal, left to right): 🦚🐊🌾⛅️🦚🌰🌈⛅️😃⛅️\n- No horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 3 (horizontal, left to right): 🦉🐊🐊😃⛅️🦉🐊😃🦉🦟\n- 🐊🐊 at positions 2-3 (length 2)\n- No other horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 4 (horizontal, left to right): 🌾🐊🌾😃🌾😃🐑🦚🌾🐊\n- No horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 5 (horizontal, left to right): 😃⛅️🌈🌾⛅️🌈🐊🐊🦟🌾\n- 🐊🐊 at positions 7-8 (length 2)\n- No other horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 6 (horizontal, left to right): ⛅️🦚🌰🌾🌰⛅️🌈🐑🌰🐊\n- No horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 7 (horizontal, left to right): 😃⛅️😃🐊⛅️🌈🦚🦚🌈🌾\n- 🦚🦚 at positions 7-8 (length 2)\n- No other horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 8 (horizontal, left to right): 🌾🦉🌰🌈🦚🦉🌈🌾⛅️😃\n- No horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 9 (horizontal, left to right): 🐊🦚🌈🌰🌾🦟🌰🌈🌈⛅️\n- 🌈🌈 at positions 8-9 (length 2)\n- No other horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 10 (horizontal, left to right): 🦟⛅️🌈🦟🐑🐊😃🐊🌈🌾\n- No horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nThat's 4 horizontal lines, the same as before.\n\nColumn 1 (vertical, top to bottom): ⛅️🦚🦉🌾😃⛅️😃🌾🐊🦟\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 2 (vertical, top to bottom): 🦟🐊🐊🐊⛅️🦚⛅️🦉🦚⛅️\n- 🐊🐊🐊 at positions 2-3-4 (length 3)\n- ⛅️⛅️ at positions 5-7 (length 2)\n- 🦚🦚 at positions 6-9 (length 2) - Wait, there's a 🦉 in position 8, so this isn't a consecutive line.\n- Actually, let me check positions again for column 2:\n\nIn column 2:\nPosition 1: 🦟\nPosition 2: 🐊\nPosition 3: 🐊\nPosition 4: 🐊\nPosition 5: ⛅️\nPosition 6: 🦚\nPosition 7: ⛅️\nPosition 8: 🦉\nPosition 9: 🦚\nPosition 10: ⛅️\n\nSo in column 2, we have:\n- 🐊🐊🐊 at positions 2-3-4 (length 3)\n- No other vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 3 (vertical, top to bottom): 🌰🌾🐊🌾🌈🌰😃🌰🌈🌈\n- 🌈🌈 at positions 9-10 (length 2)\n- No other vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 4 (vertical, top to bottom): 🌈⛅️😃😃🌾🌾🐊🌈🌰🦟\n- 😃😃 at positions 3-4 (length 2)\n- 🌾🌾 at positions 5-6 (length 2)\n- No other vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 5 (vertical, top to bottom): 🌾🦚⛅️🌾⛅️🌰⛅️🦚🌾🐑\n- ⛅️⛅️ at positions 3-5 (length 2)\n- No other vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 6 (vertical, top to bottom): 😃🌰🦉😃🌈⛅️🌈🦉🦟🐊\n- 😃😃 at positions 1-4 (length 2)\n- 🦉🦉 at positions 3-8 (length 2)\n- 🌈🌈 at positions 5-7 (length 2)\n- No other vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nWait, I made an error. Let me view columns as top-to-bottom sequences.\n\nColumn 1: ⛅️ 🦚 🦉 🌾 😃 ⛅️ 😃 🌾 🐊 🦟\nColumn 2: 🦟 🐊 🐊 🐊 ⛅️ 🦚 ⛅️ 🦉 🦚 ⛅️\nColumn 3: 🌰 🌾 🐊 🌾 🌈 🌰 😃 🌰 🌈 🌈\nColumn 4: 🌈 ⛅️ 😃 😃 🌾 🌾 🐊 🌈 🌰 🦟\nColumn 5: 🌾 🦚 ⛅️ 🌾 ⛅️ 🌰 ⛅️ 🦚 🌾 🐑\nColumn 6: 😃 🌰 🦉 😃 🌈 ⛅️ 🌈 🦉 🦟 🐊\nColumn 7: 🦚 🌈 🐊 🐑 🐊 🌈 🦚 🌈 🌰 😃\nColumn 8: 🐑 ⛅️ 😃 🦚 🐊 🐑 🦚 🌾 🌈 🐊\nColumn 9: 😃 😃 🦉 🌾 🦟 🌰 🌈 ⛅️ 🌈 🌈\nColumn 10: 🦚 ⛅️ 🦟 🐊 🌾 🐊 🌾 😃 ⛅️ 🌾\n\nNow let's count the vertical lines:\n\nColumn 1:\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 2:\n- 🐊🐊🐊 at positions 2-3-4 (length 3)\n- No other vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 3:\n- 🌈🌈 at positions 9-10 (length 2)\n- No other vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 4:\n- 😃😃 at positions 3-4 (length 2)\n- 🌾🌾 at positions 5-6 (length 2)\n- No other vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 5:\n- ⛅️⛅️ at positions 3-5 (length 2)\n- ⛅️⛅️ at positions 5-7 (length 2) - this gives us 2 lines of length 2 as they form a line of length 3 (⛅️⛅️⛅️ at positions 3-5-7)\n- No other vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nHmm, that's not right either. Let me be more careful about how I identify the vertical lines.\n\nColumn 5 (vertical, top to bottom): 🌾🦚⛅️🌾⛅️🌰⛅️🦚🌾🐑\nIn this column, we have:\nPosition 1: 🌾\nPosition 2: 🦚\nPosition 3: ⛅️\nPosition 4: 🌾\nPosition 5: ⛅️\nPosition 6: 🌰\nPosition 7: ⛅️\nPosition 8: 🦚\nPosition 9: 🌾\nPosition 10: 🐑\n\nLooking for consecutive (adjacent) emojis of the same type:\n- ⛅️⛅️ at positions 3-5 (but these are not adjacent, as position 4 has 🌾)\n- ⛅️⛅️ at positions 5-7 (but these are not adjacent, as position 6 has 🌰)\n\nI think I misunderstood what \"consecutive\" means in this context. Let me clarify:\n\nA line is a horizontal or vertical sequence of the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more. The emojis must be adjacent to each other. So for example, in the sequence \"🐊😃🐊\", there is no line of \"🐊🐊\" because they are separated by \"😃\".\n\nWith this understanding, let me redo my counting of the vertical lines:\n\nColumn 1 (vertical, top to bottom): ⛅️🦚🦉🌾😃⛅️😃🌾🐊🦟\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 2 (vertical, top to bottom): 🦟🐊🐊🐊⛅️🦚⛅️🦉🦚⛅️\n- 🐊🐊🐊 at positions 2-3-4 (length 3)\n- No other vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 3 (vertical, top to bottom): 🌰🌾🐊🌾🌈🌰😃🌰🌈🌈\n- 🌈🌈 at positions 9-10 (length 2)\n- No other vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 4 (vertical, top to bottom): 🌈⛅️😃😃🌾🌾🐊🌈🌰🦟\n- 😃😃 at positions 3-4 (length 2)\n- 🌾🌾 at positions 5-6 (length 2)\n- No other vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 5 (vertical, top to bottom): 🌾🦚⛅️🌾⛅️🌰⛅️🦚🌾🐑\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nWait, I need to be more careful. Let me check the board structure again. If we have a 10x10 board, then each row and column has 10, not 10 positions.\n\nRow 1 (horizontal, left to right): ⛅️🦟🌰🌈🌾😃🦚🐑😃🦚\nRow 2 (horizontal, left to right): 🦚🐊🌾⛅️🦚🌰🌈⛅️😃⛅️\nRow 3 (horizontal, left to right): 🦉🐊🐊😃⛅️🦉🐊😃🦉🦟\nRow 4 (horizontal, left to right): 🌾🐊🌾😃🌾😃🐑🦚🌾🐊\nRow 5 (horizontal, left to right): 😃⛅️🌈🌾⛅️🌈🐊🐊🦟🌾\nRow 6 (horizontal, left to right): ⛅️🦚🌰🌾🌰⛅️🌈🐑🌰🐊\nRow 7 (horizontal, left to right): 😃⛅️😃🐊⛅️🌈🦚🦚🌈🌾\nRow 8 (horizontal, left to right): 🌾🦉🌰🌈🦚🦉🌈🌾⛅️😃\nRow 9 (horizontal, left to right): 🐊🦚🌈🌰🌾🦟🌰🌈🌈⛅️\nRow 10 (horizontal, left to right): 🦟⛅️🌈🦟🐑🐊😃🐊🌈🌾\n\nColumn 1 (vertical, top to bottom): ⛅️🦚🦉🌾😃⛅️😃🌾🐊🦟\nColumn 2 (vertical, top to bottom): 🦟🐊🐊🐊⛅️🦚⛅️🦉🦚⛅️\nColumn 3 (vertical, top to bottom): 🌰🌾🐊🌾🌈🌰😃🌰🌈🌈\nColumn 4 (vertical, top to bottom): 🌈⛅️😃😃🌾🌾🐊🌈🌰🦟\nColumn 5 (vertical, top to bottom): 🌾🦚⛅️🌾⛅️🌰⛅️🦚🌾🐑\nColumn 6 (vertical, top to bottom): 😃🌰🦉😃🌈⛅️🌈🦉🦟🐊\nColumn 7 (vertical, top to bottom): 🦚🌈🐊🐑🐊🌈🦚🌈🌰😃\nColumn 8 (vertical, top to bottom): 🐑⛅️😃🦚🐊🐑🦚🌾🌈🐊\nColumn 9 (vertical, top to bottom): 😃😃🦉🌾🦟🌰🌈⛅️🌈🌈\nColumn 10 (vertical, top to bottom): 🦚⛅️🦟🐊🌾🐊🌾😃⛅️🌾\n\nOk now, let's count the vertical lines:\n\nColumn 1 (vertical, top to bottom): ⛅️🦚🦉🌾😃⛅️😃🌾🐊🦟\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 2 (vertical, top to bottom): 🦟🐊🐊🐊⛅️🦚⛅️🦉🦚⛅️\n- 🐊🐊🐊 at positions 2-3-4 (length 3)\n- No other vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 3 (vertical, top to bottom): 🌰🌾🐊🌾🌈🌰😃🌰🌈🌈\n- 🌈🌈 at positions 9-10 (length 2)\n- No other vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 4 (vertical, top to bottom): 🌈⛅️😃😃🌾🌾🐊🌈🌰🦟\n- 😃😃 at positions 3-4 (length 2)\n- 🌾🌾 at positions 5-6 (length 2)\n- No other vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 5 (vertical, top to bottom): 🌾🦚⛅️🌾⛅️🌰⛅️🦚🌾🐑\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 6 (vertical, top to bottom): 😃🌰🦉😃🌈⛅️🌈🦉🦟🐊\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 7 (vertical, top to bottom): 🦚🌈🐊🐑🐊🌈🦚🌈🌰😃\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 8 (vertical, top to bottom): 🐑⛅️😃🦚🐊🐑🦚🌾🌈🐊\n- 🦚🦚 at positions 4-7 - but these emojis are not adjacent, they're at positions 4 and 7.\n\nLet me double check column 8:\nPosition 1: 🐑\nPosition 2: ⛅️\nPosition 3: 😃\nPosition 4: 🦚\nPosition 5: 🐊\nPosition 6: 🐑\nPosition 7: 🦚\nPosition 8: 🌾\nPosition 9: 🌈\nPosition 10: 🐊\n\nYou're right, there are no vertical lines of length 2 or more in column 8.\n\nColumn 9 (vertical, top to bottom): 😃😃🦉🌾🦟🌰🌈⛅️🌈🌈\n- 😃😃 at positions 1-2 (length 2)\n- 🌈🌈 at positions 9-10 (length 2)\n- No other vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 10 (vertical, top to bottom): 🦚⛅️🦟🐊🌾🐊🌾😃⛅️🌾\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nSo, for vertical lines, we have 1 (length 3 in column 2) + 1 (length 2 in column 3) + 2 (length 2 in column 4) + 2 (length 2 in column 9) = 6 vertical lines.\n\nAnd for horizontal lines, we have 4 lines of length 2.\n\nSo, the total number of horizontal and vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more is 4 + 6 = 10.\n\nActually, let me double check column, to be sure:\n\nColumn 6 (vertical, top to bottom): 😃🌰🦉😃🌈⛅️🌈🦉🦟🐊\n\nPosition 1: 😃\nPosition 2: 🌰\nPosition 3: 🦉\nPosition 4: 😃\nPosition 5: 🌈\nPosition 6: ⛅️\nPosition 7: 🌈\nPosition 8: 🦉\nPosition 9: 🦟\nPosition 10: 🐊\n\nThere's no consecutive emojis of the same type, so no vertical lines of length 2 or more in column 6.\n\nSo my conclusion is the same, the total is 10 lines.\n\nOh, I just realized I double checked all columns, but I haven't double checked each row. Let me do that.\n\nRow 1 (horizontal, left to right): ⛅️🦟🌰🌈🌾😃🦚🐑😃🦚\n- No horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 2 (horizontal, left to right): 🦚🐊🌾⛅️🦚🌰🌈⛅️😃⛅️\n- No horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 3 (horizontal, left to right): 🦉🐊🐊😃⛅️🦉🐊😃🦉🦟\n- 🐊🐊 at positions 2-3 (length 2)\n- No other horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 4 (horizontal, left to right): 🌾🐊🌾😃🌾😃🐑🦚🌾🐊\n- No horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 5 (horizontal, left to right): 😃⛅️🌈🌾⛅️🌈🐊🐊🦟🌾\n- 🐊🐊 at positions 7-8 (length 2)\n- No other horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 6 (horizontal, left to right): ⛅️🦚🌰🌾🌰⛅️🌈🐑🌰🐊\n- No horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 7 (horizontal, left to right): 😃⛅️😃🐊⛅️🌈🦚🦚🌈🌾\n- 🦚🦚 at positions 7-8 (length 2)\n- No other horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 8 (horizontal, left to right): 🌾🦉🌰🌈🦚🦉🌈🌾⛅️😃\n- No horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 9 (horizontal, left to right): 🐊🦚🌈🌰🌾🦟🌰🌈🌈⛅️\n- 🌈🌈 at positions 8-9 (length 2)\n- No other horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 10 (horizontal, left to right): 🦟⛅️🌈🦟🐑🐊😃🐊🌈🌾\n- No horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nSo for vertical horizontal, we still have 4 lines of length 2. So the total is still 10 lines.\n\nTo be even more careful, let me check row 9 again:\n\nRow 9 (horizontal, left to right): 🐊🦚🌈🌰🌾🦟🌰🌈🌈⛅️\n\nPosition 1: 🐊\nPosition 2: 🦚\nPosition 3: 🌈\nPosition 4: 🌰\nPosition 5: 🌾\nPosition 6: 🦟\nPosition 7: 🌰\nPosition 8: 🌈\nPosition 9: 🌈\nPosition 10: ⛅️\n\nThere's a line of 🌈🌈 at positions 8-9 (length 2), and no other lines. So there are indeed 4 horizontal lines.\n\nSo the answer remains 10.\n\nWait, let me just double check column 5 again:\n\nColumn 5 (vertical, top to bottom): 🌾🦚⛅️🌾⛅️🌰⛅️🦚🌾🐑\n\nPosition 1: 🌾\nPosition 2: 🦚\nPosition 3: ⛅️\nPosition 4: 🌾\nPosition 5: ⛅️\nPosition 6: 🌰\nPosition 7: ⛅️\nPosition 8: 🦚\nPosition 9: 🌾\nPosition 10: 🐑\n\nI don't see any consecutive emojis of the same type, so there are no vertical lines of length 2 or more in column 5.\n\nSo the final count is 4 horizontal lines and 6 vertical lines, for a total of 10 lines.\n\nI want to double check the vertical lines again:\n\nColumn 1 (vertical, top to bottom): ⛅️🦚🦉🌾😃⛅️😃🌾🐊🦟\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 2 (vertical, top to bottom): 🦟🐊🐊🐊⛅️🦚⛅️🦉🦚⛅️\n- 🐊🐊🐊 at positions 2-3-4 (length 3)\n- No other vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 3 (vertical, top to bottom): 🌰🌾🐊🌾🌈🌰😃🌰🌈🌈\n- 🌈🌈 at positions 9-10 (length 2)\n- No other vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 4 (vertical, top to bottom): 🌈⛅️😃😃🌾🌾🐊🌈🌰🦟\n- 😃😃 at positions 3-4 (length 2)\n- 🌾🌾 at positions 5-6 (length 2)\n- No other vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 5 (vertical, top to bottom): 🌾🦚⛅️🌾⛅️🌰⛅️🦚🌾🐑\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 6 (vertical, top to bottom): 😃🌰🦉😃🌈⛅️🌈🦉🦟🐊\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 7 (vertical, top to bottom): 🦚🌈🐊🐑🐊🌈🦚🌈🌰😃\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 8 (vertical, top to bottom): 🐑⛅️😃🦚🐊🐑🦚🌾🌈🐊\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 9 (vertical, top to bottom): 😃😃🦉🌾🦟🌰🌈⛅️🌈🌈\n- 😃😃 at positions 1-2 (length 2)\n- 🌈🌈 at positions 9-10 (length 2)\n- No other vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 10 (vertical, top to bottom): 🦚⛅️🦟🐊🌾🐊🌾😃⛅️🌾\n- No vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nSo we have 6 vertical lines. Together with the 4 horizontal lines, we get a total of 10 lines.\n\nBut wait, didn't I check these columns twice already? Let me be very careful and double check:\n\n🐊🐊🐊 in column 2, positions 2-3-4\n🌈🌈 in column 3, positions 9-10\n😃😃 in column 4, positions 3-4\n🌾🌾 in column 4, positions 5-6\n😃😃 in column 9, positions 1-2\n🌈🌈 in column 9, positions 9-10\n\nThat's 6 vertical lines. I think my answer is right.\n\nSo the answer is 4 horizontal lines + 6 vertical lines = 10 lines total.I need to count horizontal and vertical lines of the same emoji that are at least 2 emoji long.\n\nLet me analyze row by row first (horizontal lines):\n\nRow 1: No horizontal lines of 2+ same emojis\nRow 2: No horizontal lines\nRow 3: 🐊🐊 at positions 2-3 (length 2)\nRow 4: No horizontal lines\nRow 5: 🐊🐊 at positions 7-8 (length 2)\nRow 6: No horizontal lines\nRow 7: 🦚🦚 at positions 7-8 (length 2)\nRow 8: No horizontal lines\nRow 9: 🌈🌈 at positions 8-9 (length 2)\nRow 10: No horizontal lines\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 4\n\nNow analyzing column by column (vertical lines):\n\nColumn 1: No vertical lines\nColumn 2: 🐊🐊🐊 at positions 2-3-4 (length 3)\nColumn 3: 🌈🌈 at positions 9-10 (length 2)\nColumn 4: 😃😃 at positions 3-4 (length 2)\n        🌾🌾 at positions 5-6 (length 2)\nColumn 5: No vertical lines\nColumn 6: No vertical lines\nColumn 7: No vertical lines\nColumn 8: No vertical lines\nColumn 9: 😃😃 at positions 1-2 (length 2)\n        🌈🌈 at positions 9-10 (length 2)\nColumn 10: No vertical lines\n\nTotal vertical lines: 6\n\nAdding horizontal and vertical lines: 4 + 6 = 10 lines total.\n\nAnswer: 10"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Let me try one more time, making sure to get the board representation and counting correct.\n\nThe board is:\n```\n🧽🌱🌙🌙🧽\n🧽🧽🌱🌙🌙\n🌱🧽🧽🌙🌙\n🌱🧽🌙🧽🌙\n🌱🧽🧽🧽🧽\n```\n\nLet's count the horizontal lines first, going row by row:\n\nRow 1: 🧽🌱🌙🌙🧽\n- 🌙🌙 (1 line)\n\nRow 2: 🧽🧽🌱🌙🌙\n- 🧽🧽 (1 line)\n- 🌙🌙 (1 line)\n\nRow 3: 🌱🧽🧽🌙🌙\n- 🧽🧽 (1 line)\n- 🌙🌙 (1 line)\n\nRow 4: 🌱🧽🌙🧽🌙\n- No lines of length 2 or more\n\nRow 5: 🌱🧽🧽🧽🧽\n- 🧽🧽🧽🧽 (1 line of length 4)\n\nSo we have 6 horizontal lines.\n\nNow let's count the vertical lines, going column by column:\n\nColumn 1: 🧽🧽🌱🌱🌱\n- 🧽🧽 (1 line)\n- 🌱🌱🌱 (1 line of length 3)\n\nColumn 2: 🌱🧽🧽🧽🧽\n- 🧽🧽🧽🧽 (1 line of length 4)\n\nColumn 3: 🌙🌱🧽🌙🧽\n- No lines of length 2 or more\n\nColumn 4: 🌙🌙🌙🧽🧽\n- 🌙🌙🌙 (1 line of length 3)\n- 🧽🧽 (1 line)\n\nColumn 5: 🧽🌙🌙🌙🧽\n- 🌙🌙🌙 (1 line of length 3)\n\nSo we have 6 vertical lines.\n\nIn total, we have 6 horizontal + 6 vertical = 12 lines.\n\nWait, I need to be more careful with Column 5. Let me double-check:\n\nColumn 5: 🧽🌙🌙🌙🧽\n- We have 3 consecutive 🌙 from rows 2-4\n- We don't have any other consecutive sequences of the same emoji\n\nSo Column 5 has only 1 line, not 2. So we have 5 vertical lines, not 6. So the total is 6 horizontal + 5 vertical = 11 lines.\n\nLet me carefully go through each column one last time:\n\nColumn 1: 🧽, 🧽, 🌱, 🌱, 🌱\n- 🧽🧽 (rows 1-2)\n- 🌱🌱🌱 (rows 3-5)\nThat's 2 lines.\n\nColumn 2: 🌱, 🧽, 🧽, 🧽, 🧽\n- 🧽🧽🧽🧽 (rows 2-5)\nThat's 1 line.\n\nColumn 3: 🌙, 🌱, 🧽, 🌙, 🧽\nNo lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 4: 🌙, 🌙, 🌙, 🧽, 🧽\n- 🌙🌙🌙 (rows 1-3)\n- 🧽🧽 (rows 4-5)\nThat's 2 lines.\n\nColumn 5: 🧽, 🌙, 🌙, 🌙, 🧽\n- 🌙🌙🌙 (rows 2-4)\nThat's 1 line.\n\nSo we have 2 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 6 vertical lines.\n\nAnd we have 6 horizontal lines.\n\nSo the total is 6 + 6 = 12 lines.\n\nBut actually, let me double-check again. I think column 5 is actually:\n🧽, 🌙, 🌙, 🌙, 🧽\n\nWhich means there are 🌙🌙🌙 in rows 2-4, which is 1 line. So column 5 contributes 1 line to the total. So I think the correct total is 6 horizontal + 6 vertical = 12 lines.\n\nLet's try to be methodical and careful. I'll count the emojis row by row, and then I'll count the lines row by row and column by column.\n\nRow 1: 🧽 🌱 🌙 🌙 🧽\nRow 2: 🧽 🧽 🌱 🌙 🌙\nRow 3: 🌱 🧽 🧽 🌙 🌙\nRow 4: 🌱 🧽 🌙 🧽 🌙\nRow 5: 🌱 🧽 🧽 🧽 🧽\n\nNow I'll extract the columns:\n\nColumn 1: 🧽 🧽 🌱 🌱 🌱\nColumn 2: 🌱 🧽 🧽 🧽 🧽\nColumn 3: 🌙 🌱 🧽 🌙 🧽\nColumn 4: 🌙 🌙 🌙 🧽 🧽\nColumn 5: 🧽 🌙 🌙 🌙 🧽\n\nLet's count the horizontal lines again:\n\nRow 1: 🧽 🌱 🌙 🌙 🧽\n- 🌙🌙 (1 line)\n\nRow 2: 🧽 🧽 🌱 🌙 🌙\n- 🧽🧽 (1 line)\n- 🌙🌙 (1 line)\n\nRow 3: 🌱 🧽 🧽 🌙 🌙\n- 🧽🧽 (1 line)\n- 🌙🌙 (1 line)\n\nRow 4: 🌱 🧽 🌙 🧽 🌙\n- No lines of length 2 or more\n\nRow 5: 🌱 🧽 🧽 🧽 🧽\n- 🧽🧽🧽🧽 (1 line of length 4)\n\nSo there are 6 horizontal lines.\n\nNow let's count the vertical lines again:\n\nColumn 1: 🧽 🧽 🌱 🌱 🌱\n- 🧽🧽 (1 line)\n- 🌱🌱🌱 (1 line of length 3)\n\nColumn 2: 🌱 🧽 🧽 🧽 🧽\n- 🧽🧽🧽🧽 (1 line of length 4)\n\nColumn 3: 🌙 🌱 🧽 🌙 🧽\n- No lines of length 2 or more\n\nColumn 4: 🌙 🌙 🌙 🧽 🧽\n- 🌙🌙🌙 (1 line of length 3)\n- 🧽🧽 (1 line)\n\nColumn 5: 🧽 🌙 🌙 🌙 🧽\n- 🌙🌙🌙 (1 line of length 3)\n\nSo there are 6 vertical lines.\n\nIn total, we have 6 horizontal + 6 vertical = 12 lines.\n\nActually, I'm getting inconsistent results, which suggests I might be making errors in how I'm representing the board. Let's redraw the board.\n\n```\n🧽🌱🌙🌙🧽\n🧽🧽🌱🌙🌙\n🌱🧽🧽🌙🌙\n🌱🧽🌙🧽🌙\n🌱🧽🧽🧽🧽\n```\n\nRow 1: 🧽 🌱 🌙 🌙 🧽\nRow 2: 🧽 🧽 🌱 🌙 🌙\nRow 3: 🌱 🧽 🧽 🌙 🌙\nRow 4: 🌱 🧽 🌙 🧽 🌙\nRow 5: 🌱 🧽 🧽 🧽 🧽\n\nColumn 1: 🧽 🧽 🌱 🌱 🌱\nColumn 2: 🌱 🧽 🧽 🧽 🧽\nColumn 3: 🌙 🌱 🧽 🌙 🧽\nColumn 4: 🌙 🌙 🌙 🧽 🧽\nColumn 5: 🧽 🌙 🌙 🌙 🧽\n\nAlright, that looks right. Now let's count the lines more carefully, and make sure I'm not double-counting or miscounting.\n\nHorizontal lines:\n- Row 1: 🌙🌙 in columns 3-4 (1 line)\n- Row 2: 🧽🧽 in columns 1-2, 🌙🌙 in columns 4-5 (2 lines)\n- Row 3: 🧽🧽 in columns 2-3, 🌙🌙 in columns 4-5 (2 lines)\n- Row 4: No lines of length 2 or more\n- Row 5: 🧽🧽🧽🧽 in columns 2-5 (1 line)\n\nSo there are 6 horizontal lines.\n\nVertical lines:\n- Column 1: 🧽🧽 in rows 1-2, 🌱🌱🌱 in rows 3-5 (2 lines)\n- Column 2: 🧽🧽🧽🧽 in rows 2-5 (1 line)\n- Column 3: No lines of length 2 or more\n- Column 4: 🌙🌙🌙 in rows 1-3, 🧽🧽 in rows 4-5 (2 lines)\n- Column 5: 🌙🌙🌙 in rows 2-4 (1 line)\n\nSo there are 6 vertical lines.\n\nIn total, we have 6 horizontal + 6 vertical = 12 lines.\n\nNow I'll double-check the last time to make sure I didn't miss anything. In my analysis I've been careful to count each line sequence only once, which is the correct way to interpret the question. So I believe 12 is the correct answer.\n\nActually, looking at column 5, let me trace it from top to bottom: 🧽 🌙 🌙 🌙 🧽. I don't think we have a line of 🧽🧽, but we do have a line of 🌙🌙🌙 (rows 2-4). So column 5 contributes 1 line.\n\nLet me just comb through all of the rows and columns one last time, to be absolutely sure:\n\nRow 1: 🧽 🌱 🌙 🌙 🧽\n- 🌙🌙 (columns 3-4)\n\nRow 2: 🧽 🧽 🌱 🌙 🌙\n- 🧽🧽 (columns 1-2)\n- 🌙🌙 (columns 4-5)\n\nRow 3: 🌱 🧽 🧽 🌙 🌙\n- 🧽🧽 (columns 2-3)\n- 🌙🌙 (columns 4-5)\n\nRow 4: 🌱 🧽 🌙 🧽 🌙\n- No lines of length 2 or more\n\nRow 5: 🌱 🧽 🧽 🧽 🧽\n- 🧽🧽🧽🧽 (columns 2-5)\n\nSo there are 6 horizontal lines.\n\nColumn 1: 🧽 🧽 🌱 🌱 🌱\n- 🧽🧽 (rows 1-2)\n- 🌱🌱🌱 (rows 3-5)\n\nColumn 2: 🌱 🧽 🧽 🧽 🧽\n- 🧽🧽🧽🧽 (rows 2-5)\n\nColumn 3: 🌙 🌱 🧽 🌙 🧽\n- No lines of length 2 or more\n\nColumn 4: 🌙 🌙 🌙 🧽 🧽\n- 🌙🌙🌙 (rows 1-3)\n- 🧽🧽 (rows 4-5)\n\nColumn 5: 🧽 🌙 🌙 🌙 🧽\n- 🌙🌙🌙 (rows 2-4)\n\nSo there are 6 vertical lines.\n\nIn total, we have 6 horizontal + 6 vertical = 12 lines.# Counting Horizontal and Vertical Emoji Lines\n\nI need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\n\nFirst, let me analyze the board:\n```\n🧽🌱🌙🌙🧽\n🧽🧽🌱🌙🌙\n🌱🧽🧽🌙🌙\n🌱🧽🌙🧽🌙\n🌱🧽🧽🧽🧽\n```\n\nLet me count the horizontal lines row by row:\n\n## Horizontal Lines:\n- Row 1: 🌙🌙 in positions 3-4 (1 line)\n- Row 2: 🧽🧽 in positions 1-2, 🌙🌙 in positions 4-5 (2 lines)\n- Row 3: 🧽🧽 in positions 2-3, 🌙🌙 in positions 4-5 (2 lines)\n- Row 4: No horizontal lines of length 2 or more\n- Row 5: 🧽🧽🧽🧽 in positions 2-5 (1 line)\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 6\n\n## Vertical Lines:\n- Column 1: 🧽🧽 in rows 1-2, 🌱🌱🌱 in rows 3-5 (2 lines)\n- Column 2: 🧽🧽🧽🧽 in rows 2-5 (1 line)\n- Column 3: No vertical lines of length 2 or more\n- Column 4: 🌙🌙🌙 in rows 1-3, 🧽🧽 in rows 4-5 (2 lines)\n- Column 5: 🌙🌙🌙 in rows 2-4 (1 line)\n\nTotal vertical lines: 6\n\n## Total Count\nAdding horizontal and vertical lines: 6 + 6 = 12\n\nAnswer: 12"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

That means the total for vertical lines is 7, not 9.\n\nIn total, there are 8 horizontal lines and 7 vertical lines, for a grand total of 15 lines.\n\nHmm, let me check again to make sure, specifically focusing on Columns 3 and 9, where I think I may have made mistakes:\n\nColumn 3:\n- row 1: 🌚\n- row 2: 🌊\n- row 3: 🌊\n- row 4: 🪐\n- row 5: 🐚\n- row 6: 🦟\n- row 7: 🦟\n- row 8: 🦟\n- row 9: 🌹\n- row 10: 🦟\n\nSo in column 3, there's:\n- 🌊🌊 at positions (3,2) and (3,3) - 1 line\n- 🦟🦟🦟 at positions (3,6), (3,7), and (3,8) - 1 line\n- No 🦟🦟 at positions (3,7) and (3,8) because this is part of the 🦟🦟🦟 line\n- 🦟🦟 at positions (3,8) and (3,10) - not a continuous line, so doesn't count\n\nSo column 3 has 2 vertical lines, which matches what I had before.\n\nColumn 9:\n- row 1: 🍃\n- row 2: 🍃\n- row 3: 🐚\n- row 4: 🌹\n- row 5: 🌚\n- row 6: 🍃\n- row 7: 🌚\n- row 8: 🍃\n- row 9: 🦟\n- row 10: 🍃\n\nSo in column 9, there's:\n- 🍃🍃 at positions (9,1) and (9,2) - 1 line\n- No other vertical lines of 2 or more same emojis\n\nSo column 9 has 1 vertical line, which is what I corrected to in my last check.\n\nLet me double-check column 9 by directly looking at the original board:\n```\n🌊🌺🌚🪐✨🌺🌚🌹🍃🌊\n🦟🪐🌊🌺🌊🍃🌹🌚🍃🍃\n🐚🐚🌊🍃🪐🦗🪐🌊🐚🌹\n🐚✨🪐🍃🌚🪐✨🦟🌹🌚\n✨🦗🐚🌹✨🍃🌚🌊🌚🦟\n🌚✨🦟🌚🍃🍃🐚🐚🍃🪐\n🦟🦟🦟🌚🌊🐚✨🦗🌚✨\n🦗🍃🦟🌚🌺🐚🌚🍃🍃🪐\n🪐🌺🌹🐚🪐🌹🐚🌺🦟🦟\n🌚🦟🦟🐚🍃✨🌊✨🍃🐚\n```\n\nIn column 9, I can see 🍃🍃 at the top, one stray 🍃 in row 6, another in row 8, and one in row 10. No vertical lines of 2 or more except for the 🍃🍃 at the top.\n\nLet me also double-check column 3:\n```\n🌊🌺🌚🪐✨🌺🌚🌹🍃🌊\n🦟🪐🌊🌺🌊🍃🌹🌚🍃🍃\n🐚🐚🌊🍃🪐🦗🪐🌊🐚🌹\n🐚✨🪐🍃🌚🪐✨🦟🌹🌚\n✨🦗🐚🌹✨🍃🌚🌊🌚🦟\n🌚✨🦟🌚🍃🍃🐚🐚🍃🪐\n🦟🦟🦟🌚🌊🐚✨🦗🌚✨\n🦗🍃🦟🌚🌺🐚🌚🍃🍃🪐\n🪐🌺🌹🐚🪐🌹🐚🌺🦟🦟\n🌚🦟🦟🐚🍃✨🌊✨🍃🐚\n```\n\nIn column 3, I can see 🌊🌊 in rows 2-3, and 🦟🦟🦟 in rows 6-8. So that's 2 vertical lines, which matches what I had before.\n\nSo we have:\n- 8 horizontal lines\n- 7 vertical lines (1 in column 1, 2 in column 3, 1 in column 4, 1 in column 6, 1 in column 7, 1 in column 9)\n\nFor a grand total of 15 lines.\n\nLet me double-check all of the vertical lines one more time:\n\nColumn 1:\n- 🐚🐚 at positions (1,3) and (1,4) - 1 line\n\nColumn 3:\n- 🌊🌊 at positions (3,2) and (3,3) - 1 line\n- 🦟🦟🦟 at positions (3,6), (3,7), and (3,8) - 1 line\n\nColumn 4:\n- 🌚🌚🌚 at positions (4,6), (4,7), and (4,8) - 1 line\n\nColumn 6:\n- 🍃🍃 at positions (6,5) and (6,6) - 1 line\n\nColumn 7:\n- 🌚🌚 at positions (7,8) and (7,9) - 1 line\n\nColumn 9:\n- 🍃🍃 at positions (9,1) and (9,2) - 1 line\n\nThat's 7 vertical lines, which matches my previous count.\n\nSo the final answer is 15 lines.\n\nLet me just triple check column 7, because I'm not sure about that 🌚🌚 line:\n```\n🌊🌺🌚🪐✨🌺🌚🌹🍃🌊\n🦟🪐🌊🌺🌊🍃🌹🌚🍃🍃\n🐚🐚🌊🍃🪐🦗🪐🌊🐚🌹\n🐚✨🪐🍃🌚🪐✨🦟🌹🌚\n✨🦗🐚🌹✨🍃🌚🌊🌚🦟\n🌚✨🦟🌚🍃🍃🐚🐚🍃🪐\n🦟🦟🦟🌚🌊🐚✨🦗🌚✨\n🦗🍃🦟🌚🌺🐚🌚🍃🍃🪐\n🪐🌺🌹🐚🪐🌹🐚🌺🦟🦟\n🌚🦟🦟🐚🍃✨🌊✨🍃🐚\n```\n\nColumn 7:\n- row 1: 🌚\n- row 2: 🌹\n- row 3: 🪐\n- row 4: ✨\n- row 5: 🌚\n- row 6: 🐚\n- row 7: ✨\n- row 8: 🌚\n- row 9: 🐚\n- row 10: 🌊\n\nSo there are no vertical lines of 2 or more same emojis in column 7. So the vertical count should be 6, not 7.\n\nSo the final answer is 14 lines (8 horizontal + 6 vertical).\n\nLet me recheck the horizontal lines:\n\nRow 1: No horizontal lines of 2 or more same emojis\n\nRow 2:\n- 🍃🍃 at positions (9,2) and (10,2) - 1 line\n\nRow 3:\n- 🐚🐚 at positions (1,3) and (2,3) - 1 line\n\nRow 4: No horizontal lines of 2 or more same emojis\n\nRow 5: No horizontal lines of 2 or more same emojis\n\nRow 6:\n- 🍃🍃 at positions (5,6) and (6,6) - 1 line\n- 🐚🐚 at positions (7,6) and (8,6) - 1 line\n\nRow 7:\n- 🦟🦟🦟 at positions (1,7), (2,7), and (3,7) - 1 line\n\nRow 8:\n- 🍃🍃 at positions (8,8) and (9,8) - 1 line\n\nRow 9:\n- 🦟🦟 at positions (9,9) and (10,9) - 1 line\n\nRow 10:\n- 🦟🦟 at positions (2,10) and (3,10) - 1 line\n\nSo that's 8 horizontal lines, which is consistent with my earlier count.\n\nAnd finally, let's recheck the vertical lines:\n\nColumn 1:\n- 🐚🐚 at positions (1,3) and (1,4) - 1 line\n\nColumn 2: No vertical lines of 2 or more same emojis\n\nColumn 3:\n- 🌊🌊 at positions (3,2) and (3,3) - 1 line\n- 🦟🦟🦟 at positions (3,6), (3,7), and (3,8) - 1 line\n\nColumn 4:\n- 🌚🌚🌚 at positions (4,6), (4,7), and (4,8) - 1 line\n\nColumn 5: No vertical lines of 2 or more same emojis\n\nColumn 6:\n- 🍃🍃 at positions (6,5) and (6,6) - 1 line\n\nColumn 7: No vertical lines of 2 or more same emojis\n\nColumn 8: No vertical lines of 2 or more same emojis\n\nColumn 9:\n- 🍃🍃 at positions (9,1) and (9,2) - 1 line\n\nThat's 6 vertical lines.\n\nSo the final answer is 14 lines (8 horizontal + 6 vertical).\n\nBut let me check column 7 by looking at the original board once more:\n```\n🌊🌺🌚🪐✨🌺🌚🌹🍃🌊\n🦟🪐🌊🌺🌊🍃🌹🌚🍃🍃\n🐚🐚🌊🍃🪐🦗🪐🌊🐚🌹\n🐚✨🪐🍃🌚🪐✨🦟🌹🌚\n✨🦗🐚🌹✨🍃🌚🌊🌚🦟\n🌚✨🦟🌚🍃🍃🐚🐚🍃🪐\n🦟🦟🦟🌚🌊🐚✨🦗🌚✨\n🦗🍃🦟🌚🌺🐚🌚🍃🍃🪐\n🪐🌺🌹🐚🪐🌹🐚🌺🦟🦟\n🌚🦟🦟🐚🍃✨🌊✨🍃🐚\n```\n\nActually, I see 🌚🌚 in column 7, rows 7-8. Let me extract the column again:\n\nColumn 7:\n- row 1: 🌚\n- row 2: 🌹\n- row 3: 🪐\n- row 4: ✨\n- row 5: 🌚\n- row 6: 🐚\n- row 7: ✨\n- row 8: 🌚\n- row 9: 🐚\n- row 10: 🌊\n\nI don't see any vertical lines of 2 or more same emojis in column 7.\n\nLet me also double-check columns 8 and 9, just to be sure:\n\nColumn 8:\n- row 1: 🌹\n- row 2: 🌚\n- row 3: 🌊\n- row 4: 🦟\n- row 5: 🌊\n- row 6: 🐚\n- row 7: 🦗\n- row 8: 🍃\n- row 9: 🌺\n- row 10: ✨\n\nNo vertical lines of 2 or more same emojis in column 8.\n\nColumn 9:\n- row 1: 🍃\n- row 2: 🍃\n- row 3: 🐚\n- row 4: 🌹\n- row 5: 🌚\n- row 6: 🍃\n- row 7: 🌚\n- row 8: 🍃\n- row 9: 🦟\n- row 10: 🍃\n\nI do see 🍃🍃 in column 9, rows 1-2. But there's no other vertical line in column 9. So that's 1 vertical line in column 9, which is what I had before.\n\nSo the final total is 14 lines (8 horizontal + 6 vertical).\n\nActually, let me just check every column and every row one more time to avoid any confusion, and to triple-check the answer.\n\nHorizontal lines (row by row):\n\nRow 1: 🌊🌺🌚🪐✨🌺🌚🌹🍃🌊\nNo horizontal lines of 2 or more same emojis\n\nRow 2: 🦟🪐🌊🌺🌊🍃🌹🌚🍃🍃\n- 🍃🍃 at positions (9,2) and (10,2) - 1 line\n\nRow 3: 🐚🐚🌊🍃🪐🦗🪐🌊🐚🌹\n- 🐚🐚 at positions (1,3) and (2,3) - 1 line\n\nRow 4: 🐚✨🪐🍃🌚🪐✨🦟🌹🌚\nNo horizontal lines of 2 or more same emojis\n\nRow 5: ✨🦗🐚🌹✨🍃🌚🌊🌚🦟\nNo horizontal lines of 2 or more same emojis\n\nRow 6: 🌚✨🦟🌚🍃🍃🐚🐚🍃🪐\n- 🍃🍃 at positions (5,6) and (6,6) - 1 line\n- 🐚🐚 at positions (7,6) and (8,6) - 1 line\n\nRow 7: 🦟🦟🦟🌚🌊🐚✨🦗🌚✨\n- 🦟🦟🦟 at positions (1,7), (2,7), and (3,7) - 1 line\n- ✨✨ at positions (9,7) and (10,7) - wait, I made a mistake, these positions don't have ✨✨, they have 🌚✨. Let me double-check.\n\nRow 7: 🦟🦟🦟🌚🌊🐚✨🦗🌚✨\n- 🦟🦟🦟 at positions (1,7), (2,7), and (3,7) - 1 line\n- No other horizontal lines of 2 or more same emojis\n\nRow 8: 🦗🍃🦟🌚🌺🐚🌚🍃🍃🪐\n- 🍃🍃 at positions (8,8) and (9,8) - 1 line\n\nRow 9: 🪐🌺🌹🐚🪐🌹🐚🌺🦟🦟\n- 🦟🦟 at positions (9,9) and (10,9) - 1 line\n\nRow 10: 🌚🦟🦟🐚🍃✨🌊✨🍃🐚\n- 🦟🦟 at positions (2,10) and (3,10) - 1 line\n\nSo that's 8 horizontal lines, as I got before.\n\nVertical lines (column by column):\n\nColumn 1: 🌊🦟🐚🐚✨🌚🦟🦗🪐🌚\n- 🐚🐚 at positions (1,3) and (1,4) - 1 line\n\nColumn 2: 🌺🪐🐚✨🦗✨🦟🍃🌺🦟\nNo vertical lines of 2 or more same emojis\n\nColumn 3: 🌚🌊🌊🪐🐚🦟🦟🦟🌹🦟\n- 🌊🌊 at positions (3,2) and (3,3) - 1 line\n- 🦟🦟🦟 at positions (3,6), (3,7), and (3,8) - 1 line\n\nColumn 4: 🪐🌺🍃🍃🌹🌚🌚🌚🐚🐚\n- 🍃🍃 at positions (4,3) and (4,4) - 1 line\n- 🌚🌚🌚 at positions (4,6), (4,7), and (4,8) - 1 line\n- 🐚🐚 at positions (4,9) and (4,10) - 1 line\n\nColumn 5: ✨🌊🪐🌚✨🍃🌊🌺🪐🍃\nNo vertical lines of 2 or more same emojis\n\nColumn 6: 🌺🍃🦗🪐🍃🍃🐚🐚🌹✨\n- 🍃🍃 at positions (6,5) and (6,6) - 1 line\n- 🐚🐚 at positions (6,7) and (6,8) - 1 line\n\nColumn 7: 🌚🌹🪐✨🌚🐚✨🌚🐚🌊\nNo vertical lines of 2 or more same emojis\n\nColumn 8: 🌹🌚🌊🦟🌊🐚🦗🍃🌺✨\nNo vertical lines of 2 or more same emojis\n\nColumn 9: 🍃🍃🐚🌹🌚🍃🌚🍃🦟🍃\n- 🍃🍃 at positions (9,1) and (9,2) - 1 line\n\nColumn 10: 🌊🍃🌹🌚🦟🪐✨🪐🦟🐚\nNo vertical lines of 2 or more same emojis\n\nSo that's a total of 8 vertical lines.\n\nCombined with the 8 horizontal lines, that gives us a grand total of 16 lines.\n\nLet me double-check column 4 one more time, because I think I might have made a mistake there:\n\nColumn 4: 🪐🌺🍃🍃🌹🌚🌚🌚🐚🐚\n- 🍃🍃 at positions (4,3) and (4,4) - 1 line\n- 🌚🌚🌚 at positions (4,6), (4,7), and (4,8) - 1 line\n- 🐚🐚 at positions (4,9) and (4,10) - 1 line\n\nAnd let me also double-check column 6:\n\nColumn 6: 🌺🍃🦗🪐🍃🍃🐚🐚🌹✨\n- 🍃🍃 at positions (6,5) and (6,6) - 1 line\n- 🐚🐚 at positions (6,7) and (6,8) - 1 line\n\nSo the final answer is 16 lines (8 horizontal + 8 vertical).\n\nActually, let me just check all columns one more time:\n\nColumn 1:\n- 🐚🐚 at positions (1,3) and (1,4) - 1 line\n- No other vertical lines of 2 or more same emojis\n\nColumn 2: No vertical lines of 2 or more same emojis\n\nColumn 3:\n- 🌊🌊 at positions (3,2) and (3,3) - 1 line\n- 🦟🦟🦟 at positions (3,6), (3,7), and (3,8) - 1 line\n\nColumn 4:\n- 🍃🍃 at positions (4,3) and (4,4) - 1 line\n- 🌚🌚🌚 at positions (4,6), (4,7), and (4,8) - 1 line\n- 🐚🐚 at positions (4,9) and (4,10) - 1 line\n\nColumn 5: No vertical lines of 2 or more same emojis\n\nColumn 6:\n- 🍃🍃 at positions (6,5) and (6,6) - 1 line\n- 🐚🐚 at positions (6,7) and (6,8) - 1 line\n\nColumn 7: No vertical lines of 2 or more same emojis\n\nColumn 8: No vertical lines of 2 or more same emojis\n\nColumn 9:\n- 🍃🍃 at positions (9,1) and (9,2) - 1 line\n- No other vertical lines of 2 or more same emojis\n\nColumn 10: No vertical lines of 2 or more same emojis\n\nSo that's a total of 8 vertical lines, as I found before.\n\nSo the final answer is 16 lines (8 horizontal + 8 vertical).To solve this problem, I need to count all horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, where a line has a length of 2 or more emojis.\n\nLet me analyze the board systematically:\n\n## Horizontal Lines (row by row)\n\nRow 1: No horizontal lines\n\nRow 2: 🍃🍃 at the end (positions 9-10) - 1 line\n\nRow 3: 🐚🐚 at the beginning (positions 1-2) - 1 line\n\nRow 4: No horizontal lines\n\nRow 5: No horizontal lines\n\nRow 6: \n- 🍃🍃 in the middle (positions 5-6) - 1 line\n- 🐚🐚 in the middle (positions 7-8) - 1 line\n\nRow 7: 🦟🦟🦟 at the beginning (positions 1-3) - 1 line\n\nRow 8: 🍃🍃 near the end (positions 8-9) - 1 line\n\nRow 9: 🦟🦟 at the end (positions 9-10) - 1 line\n\nRow 10: 🦟🦟 in the middle (positions 2-3) - 1 line\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 8\n\n## Vertical Lines (column by column)\n\nColumn 1: 🐚🐚 in rows 3-4 - 1 line\n\nColumn 2: No vertical lines\n\nColumn 3:\n- 🌊🌊 in rows 2-3 - 1 line\n- 🦟🦟🦟 in rows 6-8 - 1 line\n\nColumn 4:\n- 🍃🍃 in rows 3-4 - 1 line\n- 🌚🌚🌚 in rows 6-8 - 1 line\n- 🐚🐚 in rows 9-10 - 1 line\n\nColumn 5: No vertical lines\n\nColumn 6:\n- 🍃🍃 in rows 5-6 - 1 line\n- 🐚🐚 in rows 7-8 - 1 line\n\nColumn 7: No vertical lines\n\nColumn 8: No vertical lines\n\nColumn 9: 🍃🍃 in rows 1-2 - 1 line\n\nColumn 10: No vertical lines\n\nTotal vertical lines: 8\n\n## Total Count\nThe total number of lines (horizontal + vertical) is 8 + 8 = 16.\n\nAnswer: 16"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Vertical lines: Check each column and count sequences of the same emoji with length 2 or more.\n\nLet's start with horizontal lines:\n\nRow 1:\n- 🦚 (1)\n- 🐆 (1)\n- 🐕 (1)\n- 🌷 (1)\n- 🌹 (1)\n- 🐆 (1)\n- 🌕 (1)\n- 🦚 (1)\n- 🦢 (1)\n- 🌕 (1)\nNo horizontal lines here.\n\nRow 2:\n- 🦢 (1)\n- 🐕 (1)\n- 🌹 (1)\n- 🐆 (1)\n- 🐕 (1)\n- 🐊 (1)\n- 🌷 (1)\n- 🦢 (1)\n- 😄 (1)\n- 🐊 (1)\nNo horizontal lines here.\n\nRow 3:\n- 🌹 (1)\n- 🌹 (1) (continues from the previous, so we have a sequence of 2 🌹)\n- 🌷 (1)\n- 🐕 (1)\n- 🐊 (1)\n- 😄 (1)\n- 🦚 (1)\n- 🐊 (1)\n- 😄 (1)\n- 🌕 (1)\nHorizontal line: 🌹🌹 (length 2)\n\nRow 4:\n- 🌷 (1)\n- 🦢 (1)\n- 🐆 (1)\n- 🌷 (1)\n- 🌕 (1)\n- 🌹 (1)\n- 🌷 (1)\n- 🌕 (1)\n- 🌷 (1)\n- 🐊 (1)\nNo horizontal lines here.\n\nRow 5:\n- 😄 (1)\n- 🐆 (1)\n- 😄 (1)\n- 🐆 (1)\n- 🦚 (1)\n- 🦚 (1) (continues from the previous, so we have a sequence of 2 🦚)\n- 🐆 (1)\n- 😄 (1)\n- 🌷 (1)\n- 🌹 (1)\nHorizontal line: 🦚🦚 (length 2)\n\nRow 6:\n- 🐊 (1)\n- 🐕 (1)\n- 🦇 (1)\n- 🦢 (1)\n- 🦢 (1) (continues from the previous, so we have a sequence of 2 🦢)\n- 😄 (1)\n- 🦇 (1)\n- 🐊 (1)\n- 🦇 (1)\n- 🐕 (1)\nHorizontal line: 🦢🦢 (length 2)\n\nWait, I realized I'm getting confused with my own notation. Let me use a clearer approach. When I list the emojis, I'll indicate their count in parentheses, and then determine if there's a horizontal line or not.\n\nStarting over:\n\nRow 1:\n- 🦚 (1)\n- 🐆 (1)\n- 🐕 (1)\n- 🌷 (1)\n- 🌹 (1)\n- 🐆 (1)\n- 🌕 (1)\n- 🦚 (1)\n- 🦢 (1)\n- 🌕 (1)\nNo horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 2:\n- 🦢 (1)\n- 🐕 (1)\n- 🌹 (1)\n- 🐆 (1)\n- 🐕 (1)\n- 🐊 (1)\n- 🌷 (1)\n- 🦢 (1)\n- 😄 (1)\n- 🐊 (1)\nNo horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 3:\n- 🌹 (2) - Horizontal line!\n- 🌷 (1)\n- 🐕 (1)\n- 🐊 (1)\n- 😄 (1)\n- 🦚 (1)\n- 🐊 (1)\n- 😄 (1)\n- 🌕 (1)\n\nI'm going to try a different approach now. I'll go through each row and look for sequences of the same emoji with length 2 or more, and do the same for columns.\n\nLet's do this:\n\nHorizontal lines (row by row):\n\nRow 1: No sequences.\nRow 2: No sequences.\nRow 3: 🌹🌹 (1 sequence)\nRow 4: No sequences.\nRow 5: 🦚🦚 (1 sequence)\nRow 6: 🦢🦢 (1 sequence)\nRow 7: 🦢🦢🦢 (1 sequence of length 3, which also gives us 2 sequences of length 2: 🦢🦢 and 🦢🦢), 😄😄 (1 sequence)\nRow 8: No sequences.\nRow 9: No sequences.\nRow 10: 🦢🦇🦚🦚 (1 sequence of 🦚🦚)\n\nSo, for horizontal lines, we have 6 sequences.\n\nVertical lines (column by column):\n\nColumn 1:\n- 🦚 (1)\n- 🦢 (1)\n- 🌹 (1)\n- 🌷 (1)\n- 😄 (1)\n- 🐊 (1)\n- 🦢 (1)\n- 🌹 (1)\n- 🌷 (1)\n- 🐆 (1)\nNo vertical lines here.\n\nColumn 2:\n- 🐆 (1)\n- 🐕 (1)\n- 🌹 (1)\n- 🦢 (1)\n- 🐆 (1)\n- 🐕 (1)\n- 🦢 (1)\n- 🌷 (1)\n- 🐕 (1)\n- 🌹 (1)\nNo vertical lines here.\n\nColumn 3:\n- 🐕 (1)\n- 🌹 (1)\n- 🌷 (1)\n- 🐆 (1)\n- 😄 (1)\n- 🦇 (1)\n- 🦢 (1)\n- 🌹 (1)\n- 🌕 (1)\n- 🌷 (1)\nNo vertical lines here.\n\nColumn 4:\n- 🌷 (1)\n- 🐆 (1)\n- 🐕 (1)\n- 🌷 (1)\n- 🐆 (1)\n- 🦢 (1)\n- 🌷 (1)\n- 🐕 (1)\n- 🐊 (1)\n- 🦚 (1)\nNo vertical lines here.\n\nColumn 5:\n- 🌹 (1)\n- 🐕 (1)\n- 🐊 (1)\n- 🌕 (1)\n- 🦚 (1)\n- 🦢 (1)\n- 🐆 (1)\n- 😄 (1)\n- 🦇 (1)\n- 🦢 (1)\nNo vertical lines here.\n\nWait, I'm doing this very inefficiently. Let me just focus on finding runs directly.\n\nFor horizontal lines:\nRow 1: No sequences of length 2 or more.\nRow 2: No sequences of length 2 or more.\nRow 3: 🌹🌹 (1 sequence)\nRow 4: No sequences of length 2 or more.\nRow 5: 🦚🦚 (1 sequence)\nRow 6: 🦢🦢 (1 sequence)\nRow 7: 🦢🦢🦢 (1 sequence), 😄😄 (1 sequence)\nRow 8: No sequences of length 2 or more.\nRow 9: No sequences of length 2 or more.\nRow 10: 🦚🦚 (1 sequence)\nTotal horizontal lines: 6\n\nNow, for vertical lines:\nColumn 1: No sequences of length 2 or more.\nColumn 2: No sequences of length 2 or more.\nColumn 3: No sequences of length 2 or more.\nColumn 4: No sequences of length 2 or more.\nColumn 5: No sequences of length 2 or more.\nColumn 6: No sequences of length 2 or more.\nColumn 7: No sequences of length 2 or more.\nColumn 8: 🐊🐊 (1 sequence)\nColumn 9: 🦇🦇 (1 sequence)\nColumn 10: 🐊🐊 (1 sequence)\nTotal vertical lines: 3\n\nTotal horizontal and vertical lines: 6 + 3 = 9\n\nBut that doesn't seem right, let me double-check.\n\nIt seems like I'm missing something when counting the lines. Let me redefine the problem: I need to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\n\nSo, for a line of length L, there are (L - 1) + (L - 2) + ... + 1 different possible lines with length of 2 or more.\nFor example, a line of 3 emojis (e.g., 🦢🦢🦢) can form:\n- 3 lines of length 2: (🦢🦢, 🦢🦢) (note: there's an overlap, so we're double-counting)\n- 1 line of length 3: 🦢🦢🦢\nThat's a total of 3 lines.\n\nWait, for a line of 3 emojis, there are 2 lines of length 2 and 1 line of length 3, for a total of 3. The formula is (L * (L+1))\/2 - L = (L * (L-1))\/2.\n\nI will re-count using this approach.\n\nFor horizontal lines:\nRow 1: No sequences of length 2 or more.\nRow 2: No sequences of length 2 or more.\nRow 3: 🌹🌹 (length 2) -> 1 line\nRow 4: No sequences of length 2 or more.\nRow 5: 🦚🦚 (length 2) -> 1 line\nRow 6: 🦢🦢 (length 2) -> 1 line\nRow 7: 🦢🦢🦢 (length 3) -> 3 lines, 😄😄 (length 2) -> 1 line\nRow 8: No sequences of length 2 or more.\nRow 9: No sequences of length 2 or more.\nRow 10: 🦚🦚 (length 2) -> 1 line\nTotal horizontal lines: 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 8\n\nActually, no, this still doesn't seem right for a line of length 3 like 🦢🦢🦢. Let me rethink this. We have a sequence of 3 of the same emoji, and we want to count how many horizontal lines there are with a length of 2 or more:\n- Lines of length 2: 🦢🦢, 🦢🦢 (starting from positions 0 and 1). That's 2 lines.\n- Lines of length 3: 🦢🦢🦢 (starting from position 0). That's 1 line.\nSo, for a line of length 3, there are 2 + 1 = 3 valid lines.\n\nFor a line of length L, there are (L-1) lines of length 2, (L-2) lines of length 3, ..., 1 line of length L. In total, that's (L-1) + (L-2) + ... + 1 = (L * (L-1))\/2 valid lines.\n\nLet me revise:\n\nFor a line of length 2 (e.g., 🌹🌹), there's only 1 valid line.\nFor a line of length 3 (e.g., 🦢🦢🦢), there are 2 lines of length 2 and 1 line of length 3, for a total of 3 valid lines.\n\nLet's redo the count:\n\nFor horizontal lines:\nRow 1: No sequences of length 2 or more.\nRow 2: No sequences of length 2 or more.\nRow 3: 🌹🌹 (length 2) -> 1 line\nRow 4: No sequences of length 2 or more.\nRow 5: 🦚🦚 (length 2) -> 1 line\nRow 6: 🦢🦢 (length 2) -> 1 line\nRow 7: 🦢🦢🦢 (length 3) -> 3 lines, 😄😄 (length 2) -> 1 line\nRow 8: No sequences of length 2 or more.\nRow 9: No sequences of length 2 or more.\nRow 10: 🦚🦚 (length 2) -> 1 line\nTotal horizontal lines: 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 8\n\nOh, actually I misunderstood the problem. It seems like we're supposed to count the number of unique lines (of length 2 or more). A line is a continuous sequence of the same emoji, and we count it as a single line, regardless of its length.\n\nLet me redefine and recount:\n\nHorizontal lines:\nRow 1: No lines of length 2 or more.\nRow 2: No lines of length 2 or more.\nRow 3: 🌹🌹 (1 line)\nRow 4: No lines of length 2 or more.\nRow 5: 🦚🦚 (1 line)\nRow 6: 🦢🦢 (1 line)\nRow 7: 🦢🦢🦢 (1 line), 😄😄 (1 line)\nRow 8: No lines of length 2 or more.\nRow 9: No lines of length 2 or more.\nRow 10: 🦚🦚 (1 line)\nTotal horizontal lines: 6\n\nVertical lines:\nNow let's check column by column:\n\nColumn 1:\n- 🦚\n- 🦢\n- 🌹\n- 🌷\n- 😄\n- 🐊\n- 🦢\n- 🌹\n- 🌷\n- 🐆\nNo sequences of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 2:\n- 🐆\n- 🐕\n- 🌹\n- 🦢\n- 🐆\n- 🐕\n- 🦢\n- 🌷\n- 🐕\n- 🌹\nNo sequences of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 3:\n- 🐕\n- 🌹\n- 🌷\n- 🐆\n- 😄\n- 🦇\n- 🦢\n- 🌹\n- 🌕\n- 🌷\nNo sequences of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 4:\n- 🌷\n- 🐆\n- 🐕\n- 🌷\n- 🐆\n- 🦢\n- 🌷\n- 🐕\n- 🐊\n- 🦚\nNo sequences of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 5:\n- 🌹\n- 🐕\n- 🐊\n- 🌕\n- 🦚\n- 🦢\n- 🐆\n- 😄\n- 🦇\n- 🦢\nNo sequences of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 6:\n- 🐆\n- 🐊\n- 😄\n- 🌹\n- 🦚\n- 😄\n- 🌷\n- 🌹\n- 🌹\n- 🐕\nNo sequences of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 7:\n- 🌕\n- 🌷\n- 🦚\n- 🌷\n- 🐆\n- 🦇\n- 🌕\n- 😄\n- 😄\n- 🦢\nThere's a sequence of 😄😄 in positions 8 and 9. So, 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn 8:\n- 🦚\n- 🦢\n- 🐊\n- 🌕\n- 😄\n- 🐊\n- 🌹\n- 🐕\n- 🦇\n- 🦇\nThere's a sequence of 🦇🦇 in positions 8 and 9. So, 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn 9:\n- 🦢\n- 😄\n- 😄\n- 🌷\n- 🌷\n- 🦇\n- 😄\n- 🐆\n- 🦚\n- 🦚\nThere are sequences of 😄😄 in positions 1 and 2, 🌷🌷 in positions 3 and 4, and 🦚🦚 in positions 8 and 9. So, 3 vertical lines.\n\nColumn 10:\n- 🌕\n- 🐊\n- 🌕\n- 🐊\n- 🌹\n- 🐕\n- 😄\n- 🐊\n- 🦢\n- 🦚\nNo sequences of length 2 or more.\n\nTotal vertical lines: 1 + 1 + 3 = 5\n\nTotal lines (horizontal + vertical): 6 + 5 = 11\n\nWait, let me double-check column 9:\n\nColumn 9:\n- 🦢\n- 😄\n- 😄\n- 🌷\n- 🌷\n- 🦇\n- 😄\n- 🐆\n- 🦚\n- 🦚\n\nI see a sequence of 😄😄 (1 line), then 🌷🌷 (1 line), and finally 🦚🦚 (1 line). That's 3 vertical lines in column 9.\n\nSo, total vertical lines: 1 + 1 + 3 = 5\nAnd the total is: 6 + 5 = 11\n\nActually, I made a mistake in my vertical column check. Let me go through the board again, column by column:\n\nColumn 1:\n🦚\n🦢\n🌹\n🌷\n😄\n🐊\n🦢\n🌹\n🌷\n🐆\nNo continuous sequences of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 2:\n🐆\n🐕\n🌹\n🦢\n🐆\n🐕\n🦢\n🌷\n🐕\n🌹\nNo continuous sequences of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 3:\n🐕\n🌹\n🌷\n🐆\n😄\n🦇\n🦢\n🌹\n🌕\n🌷\nNo continuous sequences of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 4:\n🌷\n🐆\n🐕\n🌷\n🐆\n🦢\n🌷\n🐕\n🐊\n🦚\nNo continuous sequences of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 5:\n🌹\n🐕\n🐊\n🌕\n🦚\n🦢\n🐆\n😄\n🦇\n🦢\nNo continuous sequences of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 6:\n🐆\n🐊\n😄\n🌹\n🦚\n😄\n🌷\n🌹\n🌹\n🐕\nThere's a sequence of 🌹🌹 in positions 7 and 8. So, 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn 7:\n🌕\n🌷\n🦚\n🌷\n🐆\n🦇\n🌕\n😄\n😄\n🦢\nThere's a sequence of 😄😄 in positions 7 and 8. So, 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn 8:\n🦚\n🦢\n🐊\n🌕\n😄\n🐊\n🌹\n🐕\n🦇\n🦇\nThere's a sequence of 🦇🦇 in positions 8 and 9. So, 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn 9:\n🦢\n😄\n😄\n🌷\n🌷\n🦇\n😄\n🐆\n🦚\n🦚\nThere are sequences of 😄😄 in positions 1 and 2, 🌷🌷 in positions 3 and 4, and 🦚🦚 in positions 8 and 9. So, 3 vertical lines.\n\nColumn 10:\n🌕\n🐊\n🌕\n🐊\n🌹\n🐕\n😄\n🐊\n🦢\n🦚\nNo continuous sequences of length 2 or more.\n\nTotal vertical lines: 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 6\nAnd the total lines (horizontal + vertical): 6 + 6 = 12\n\nActually, I realized that I'm looking at the wrong positions for some columns. Let me clarify:\n\nColumn 6 (the 6th column from the left):\n🐆\n🐊\n😄\n🌹\n🦚\n😄\n🌷\n🌹\n🌹\n🐕\nThere's a sequence of 🌹🌹 in positions 7 and 8. So, 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn 7 (the 7th column from the left):\n🌕\n🌷\n🦚\n🌷\n🐆\n🦇\n🌕\n😄\n😄\n🦢\nThere's a sequence of 😄😄 in positions 7 and 8. So, 1 vertical line.\n\nBut wait, I'm starting from 0 for position indexing, and I might be confusing myself. Let me try again with a clearer approach:\n\nColumn 1 (the 1st column from the left):\n```\n🦚 (row 0)\n🦢 (row 1)\n🌹 (row 2)\n🌷 (row 3)\n😄 (row 4)\n🐊 (row 5)\n🦢 (row 6)\n🌹 (row 7)\n🌷 (row 8)\n🐆 (row 9)\n```\nI don't see any continuous sequences of the same emoji for a length of 2 or more.\n\nColumn 2:\n```\n🐆 (row 0)\n🐕 (row 1)\n🌹 (row 2)\n🦢 (row 3)\n🐆 (row 4)\n🐕 (row 5)\n🦢 (row 6)\n🌷 (row 7)\n🐕 (row 8)\n🌹 (row 9)\n```\nAgain, no continuous sequences of the same emoji for a length of 2 or more.\n\nColumn 3:\n```\n🐕 (row 0)\n🌹 (row 1)\n🌷 (row 2)\n🐆 (row 3)\n😄 (row 4)\n🦇 (row 5)\n🦢 (row 6)\n🌹 (row 7)\n🌕 (row 8)\n🌷 (row 9)\n```\nNo continuous sequences.\n\nColumn 4:\n```\n🌷 (row 0)\n🐆 (row 1)\n🐕 (row 2)\n🌷 (row 3)\n🐆 (row 4)\n🦢 (row 5)\n🌷 (row 6)\n🐕 (row 7)\n🐊 (row 8)\n🦚 (row 9)\n```\nNo continuous sequences.\n\nColumn 5:\n```\n🌹 (row 0)\n🐕 (row 1)\n🐊 (row 2)\n🌕 (row 3)\n🦚 (row 4)\n🦢 (row 5)\n🐆 (row 6)\n😄 (row 7)\n🦇 (row 8)\n🦢 (row 9)\n```\nNo continuous sequences.\n\nColumn 6:\n```\n🐆 (row 0)\n🐊 (row 1)\n😄 (row 2)\n🌹 (row 3)\n🦚 (row 4)\n😄 (row 5)\n🌷 (row 6)\n🌹 (row 7)\n🌹 (row 8)\n🐕 (row 9)\n```\nThere's a continuous sequence of 🌹🌹 in rows 7 and 8.

So, the total is 12.\n\nActually, let me double-check the vertical check for position 8 (9th column from the left):\n```\n🦢 (row 0)\n😄 (row 1)\n😄 (row 2)\n🌷 (row 3)\n🌷 (row 4)\n🦇 (row 5)\n😄 (row 6)\n🐆 (row 7)\n🦚 (row 8)\n🦚 (row 9)\n```\nYes, there are continuous sequences of 😄😄 in rows 1 and 2, 🌷🌷 in rows 3 and 4, and 🦚🦚 in rows 8 and 9. So, 3 vertical lines.\n\nAlright, so the total is 12, which is the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\n\nActually, I realize that our position counting is confused. Let's do a cleaner approach. I'll count rows as 0, 1, 2, ..., 9 from top to bottom, and columns as 0, 1, 2, ..., 9 from left to right:\n\nThe board:\n```\n🦚🐆🐕🌷🌹🐆🌕🦚🦢🌕  (row 0)\n🦢🐕🌹🐆🐕🐊🌷🦢😄🐊  (row 1)\n🌹🌹🌷🐕🐊😄🦚🐊😄🌕  (row 2)\n🌷🦢🐆🌷🌕🌹🌷🌕🌷🐊  (row 3)\n😄🐆😄🐆🦚🦚🐆😄🌷🌹  (row 4)\n🐊🐕🦇🦢🦢😄🦇🐊🦇🐕  (row 5)\n🦢🦢🦢🌷🐆🌷🌕🌹😄😄  (row 6)\n🌹🌷🌹🐕😄🌹😄🐕🐆🐊  (row 7)\n🌷🐕🌕🐊🦇🌹😄🦇🦚🦢  (row 8)\n🐆🌹🌷🦚🦢🐕🦢🦇🦚🦚  (row 9)\nCol:0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nHorizontal lines:\nRow 0: No lines.\nRow 1: No lines.\nRow 2: 🌹🌹 at columns 0-1. 1 line.\nRow 3: No lines.\nRow 4: 🦚🦚 at columns 4-5. 1 line.\nRow 5: 🦢🦢 at columns 3-4. 1 line.\nRow 6: 🦢🦢🦢 at columns 0-2, 😄😄 at columns 8-9. 2 lines.\nRow 7: No lines.\nRow 8: No lines.\nRow 9: 🦚🦚 at columns 8-9. 1 line.\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 6.\n\nVertical lines:\nColumn 0: No lines.\nColumn 1: No lines.\nColumn 2: No lines.\nColumn 3: No lines.\nColumn 4: No lines.\nColumn 5: 🌹🌹 at rows 7-8. 1 line.\nColumn 6: 😄😄 at rows 7-8. 1 line.\nColumn 7: 🦇🦇 at rows 8-9. 1 line.\nColumn 8: 😄😄 at rows 1-2, 🌷🌷 at rows 3-4, 🦚🦚 at rows 8-9. 3 lines.\nColumn 9: No lines.\n\nTotal vertical lines: 6.\n\nTotal lines: 6 + 6 = 12.\n\nWait, let me do a visual inspection of column 8 to ensure there are indeed 3 vertical lines.\n\nColumn 8:\n```\n🦢 (row 0)\n😄 (row 1)\n😄 (row 2)\n🌷 (row 3)\n🌷 (row 4)\n🦇 (row 5)\n😄 (row 6)\n🐆 (row 7)\n🦚 (row 8)\n🦚 (row 9)\n```\n\nLet's trace these one by one:\n1. 😄😄 at rows 1-2: They are adjacent and it's a valid line.\n2. 🌷🌷 at rows 3-4: They are adjacent and it's a valid line.\n3. 🦚🦚 at rows 8-9: They are adjacent and it's a valid line.\n\nIt's been hard to read directly from emojis, so let me just double check again:\n\n```\nC0  C1  C2  C3  C4  C5  C6  C7  C8  C9\nR0: 🦚  🐆  🐕  🌷  🌹  🐆  🌕  🦚  🦢  🌕\nR1: 🦢  🐕  🌹  🐆  🐕  🐊  🌷  🦢  😄  🐊\nR2: 🌹  🌹  🌷  🐕  🐊  😄  🦚  🐊  😄  🌕\nR3: 🌷  🦢  🐆  🌷  🌕  🌹  🌷  🌕  🌷  🐊\nR4: 😄  🐆  😄  🐆  🦚  🦚  🐆  😄  🌷  🌹\nR5: 🐊  🐕  🦇  🦢  🦢  😄  🦇  🐊  🦇  🐕\nR6: 🦢  🦢  🦢  🌷  🐆  🌷  🌕  🌹  😄  😄\nR7: 🌹  🌷  🌹  🐕  😄  🌹  😄  🐕  🐆  🐊\nR8: 🌷  🐕  🌕  🐊  🦇  🌹  😄  🦇  🦚  🦢\nR9: 🐆  🌹  🌷  🦚  🦢  🐕  🦢  🦇  🦚  🦚\n```\n\nColumn 8:\n```\nR0: 🦢\nR1: 😄\nR2: 😄 (continues from R1)\nR3: 🌷\nR4: 🌷 (continues from R3)\nR5: 🦇\nR6: 😄\nR7: 🐆\nR8: 🦚\nR9: 🦚 (continues from R8)\n```\n\nSo in Column 8, there are 3 sequences: 😄😄 at rows R1-R2, 🌷🌷 at rows R3-R4, and 🦚🦚 at rows R8-R9.

This counts as one line. This changes my count.\n\nLet me carefully go through each column again:\n\nColumn 0:\n- 🦎🦎 at (0,0)-(1,0): length 2\n- 🌍🌍 at (2,0)-(3,0): length 2\n\nColumn 1:\n- 🌍🌍 at (1,1)-(2,1): length 2\n\nColumn 2:\n- No vertical lines of length 2+\n\nColumn 3:\n- No vertical lines of length 2+\n\nColumn 4:\n- 🌍🌍 at (1,4)-(2,4): length 2\n\nColumn 5:\n- 🌍🌍🌍 at (0,5)-(1,5)-(2,5): length 3 (counts as one line)\n\nColumn 6:\n- 🤚🤚 at (3,6)-(4,6): length 2\n\nTotal vertical lines: 2 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6\n\nNo, I'm still not seeing it correctly. Let me go position by position for column 5:\n\n- (0,5): 🌍\n- (1,5): 🌍\n- (2,5): 🌍 \n- (3,5): 🦄\n- (4,5): 🌍\n- (5,5): 🤚\n- (6,5): 😄\n\nSo in column 5, we have three 🌍 emojis in positions (0,5), (1,5), and (2,5). This forms a vertical line of length 3, which counts as one line.\n\nI think I'm getting confused because I'm uncertain about how lines are counted. Let me clarify: a line is a sequence of 2 or more of the same emoji in a horizontal or vertical direction. The length of the line is the number of emojis in the sequence.\n\nLet me recount the horizontal and vertical lines once more:\n\nHorizontal lines:\n- Row 0: 🦎🦎 at (0,0)-(0,1) (length 2)\n- Row 1: 🌍🌍 at (1,4)-(1,5) (length 2)\n- Row 2: 🌍🌍 at (2,0)-(2,1) (length 2), 😄😄 at (2,2)-(2,3) (length 2), 🌍🌍 at (2,4)-(2,5) (length 2)\n- Row 4: 🤚🤚 at (4,0)-(4,1) (length 2)\n- Row 5: 🐡🐡 at (5,2)-(5,3) (length 2), 🤚🤚 at (5,4)-(5,5) (length 2)\n- Row 6: 😄😄 at (6,2)-(6,3) (length 2)\n\nSo there are 9 horizontal lines.\n\nVertical lines:\n- Column 0: 🦎🦎 at (0,0)-(1,0) (length 2), 🌍🌍 at (2,0)-(3,0) (length 2)\n- Column 1: 🌍🌍 at (1,1)-(2,1) (length 2)\n- Column 4: 🌍🌍 at (1,4)-(2,4) (length 2)\n- Column 5: 🌍🌍🌍 at (0,5)-(1,5)-(2,5) (length 3)\n- Column 6: 🤚🤚 at (3,6)-(4,6) (length 2)\n\nSo there are 6 vertical lines.\n\nTotal number of lines: 9 + 6 = 15.\n\nLet me check column 0 once more to be sure:\n- (0,0): 🦎\n- (1,0): 🦎\n- (2,0): 🌍\n- (3,0): 🌍\n- (4,0): 🤚\n- (5,0): 🦄\n- (6,0): 🤚\n\nSo in column 0, we have:\n- 🦎🦎 at (0,0)-(1,0) (length 2)\n- 🌍🌍 at (2,0)-(3,0) (length 2)\n\nAnd let me double check column 5:\n- (0,5): 🌍\n- (1,5): 🌍\n- (2,5): 🌍\n- (3,5): 🦄\n- (4,5): 🌍\n- (5,5): 🤚\n- (6,5): 😄\n\nIn column 5, we have:\n- 🌍🌍🌍 at (0,5)-(1,5)-(2,5) (length 3)\n\nSo the total number of vertical lines is 6.\n\nAnd the total number of lines (horizontal + vertical) = 9 + 6 = 15.\n\nWhen counting lines, I need to be careful:\n1. A line is a sequence of the same emoji in a horizontal or vertical direction.\n2. The line must have a length of 2 or more (i.e., consist of 2 or more identical emojis).\n3. Each line counts as 1, regardless of its length (e.g., a line of 3 same emojis counts as 1 line, not 2).\n\nBased on these criteria, I've found 9 horizontal lines and 6 vertical lines, for a total of 15 lines.\n\nLet me make a final review of the board:\n\n```\n🦎🦎🐡😄🐡🌍😄\n🦎🌍🤚🐡🌍🌍🤚\n🌍🌍😄😄🌍🌍😄\n🌍🐡🦄🤚😄🦄🤚\n🤚🤚🦎🤚🦄🌍🤚\n🦄🌍🐡🐡🤚🤚🦎\n🤚🦎😄😄🦄😄🦄\n```\n\nYes, my counts look correct. There are 15 lines in total.\n\nActually, let me verify column 5 one more time:\n```\nColumn 5:\n(0,5): 🌍\n(1,5): 🌍\n(2,5): 🌍\n(3,5): 🦄\n(4,5): 🌍\n(5,5): 🤚\n(6,5): 😄\n```\n\nI see that there's a 🌍 at position (4,5), but it's not part of a continuous line with the other 🌍 emojis because there's a 🦄 at position (3,5) that breaks the sequence. So in column 5, we only have one vertical line: 🌍🌍🌍 at positions (0,5)-(1,5)-(2,5) with length 3.\n\nLet me double check column 4 as well:\n```\nColumn 4:\n(0,4): 🐡\n(1,4): 🌍\n(2,4): 🌍\n(3,4): 😄\n(4,4): 🦄\n(5,4): 🤚\n(6,4): 🦄\n```\n\nIn column 4, we have one vertical line: 🌍🌍 at positions (1,4)-(2,4) with length 2.\n\nSo my count of 6 vertical lines is correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of lines (horizontal + vertical) = 9 + 6 = 15.I need to count all horizontal and vertical lines of the same emoji with length 2 or more in this board.\n\nLet me analyze the board systematically by examining each row and column:\n\nHorizontal lines (rows):\n- Row 1: 🦎🦎 at the start (length 2)\n- Row 2: 🌍🌍 in positions 5-6 (length 2)\n- Row 3: 🌍🌍 at the start (length 2), 😄😄 in the middle (length 2), 🌍🌍 after that (length 2)\n- Row 4: No horizontal lines of length 2+\n- Row 5: 🤚🤚 at the start (length 2)\n- Row 6: 🐡🐡 in the middle (length 2), 🤚🤚 after that (length 2)\n- Row 7: 😄😄 in the middle (length 2)\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 1 + 1 + 3 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 9\n\nVertical lines (columns):\n- Column 1: 🦎🦎 at the top (length 2), 🌍🌍 below that (length 2)\n- Column 2: 🌍🌍 in rows 2-3 (length 2)\n- Column 3: No vertical lines of length 2+\n- Column 4: No vertical lines of length 2+\n- Column 5: 🌍🌍 in rows 2-3 (length 2)\n- Column 6: 🌍🌍🌍 at the top (length 3)\n- Column 7: 🤚🤚 in rows 4-5 (length 2)\n\nTotal vertical lines: 2 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6\n\nThe total number of lines (horizontal + vertical) = 9 + 6 = 15.\n\nAnswer: 15"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

A line could be longer than 2 emoji, such as the \"🐧🐧🐧\" in row 6.\n\nIn my analysis above, I've done exactly that: I've counted the horizontal lines in each row and the vertical lines in each column where the same emoji appears consecutively at least 2 times. I've found 9 horizontal lines and 7 vertical lines, for a total of 16 lines.\n\nLet me make sure my count is correct by listing each line:\n\nHorizontal lines:\n1. Row 1: 🌘🌘 in positions 3-4\n2. Row 2: 🐧🐧 in positions 5-6\n3. Row 5: 🐓🐓 in positions 4-5\n4. Row 6: 🐧🐧🐧 in positions 3-5\n5. Row 6: 🦏🦏 in positions 7-8\n6. Row 6: 🐌🐌 in positions 9-10\n7. Row 7: 🌍🌍 in positions 6-7\n8. Row 8: 🦏🦏 in positions 5-6\n9. Row 10: 🐌🐌 in positions 4-5\n\nVertical lines:\n1. Column 1: 🌍🌍 in rows 1-2\n2. Column 3: 🐧🐧 in rows 5-6\n3. Column 5: 🐧🐧 in rows 2-3\n4. Column 6: 🐧🐧 in rows 1-2\n5. Column 9: 🐧🐧 in rows 2-3\n6. Column 9: 🌍🌍 in rows 7-8\n7. Column 9: 🌲🌲 in rows 9-10\n\nThat's 9 horizontal lines and 7 vertical lines, for a total of 16 lines.\n\nLet's double-check the board one more time to make sure I have not missed any lines:\n\nRow 1: 🌍🐓🌘🌘🦏🐧🐌🌘🐫🐧\nRow 2: 🌍🐫🐓🐫🐧🐧🐓🐌🐧🌲\nRow 3: 🌲🦏🌘🌲🐧🦓🐫🌘🐧🐌\nRow 4: 🌍🌘🐌🌍🐌🌍🦓🐌🌍🌘\nRow 5: 🐓🌲🐧🐓🐓🐧🐌🌍🦏🌲\nRow 6: 🦏🐓🐧🐧🐧🐫🦏🦏🐌🐌\nRow 7: 🐫🐌🌲🦏🐌🌍🌍🐌🌍🦓\nRow 8: 🦏🦓🌍🐓🦏🦏🌲🦓🌍🐧\nRow 9: 🐫🌘🦓🌘🐫🐓🦏🐫🌲🐓\nRow 10: 🌍🐧🦏🐌🐌🌍🐫🌘🌲🦏\n\nFor the columns:\n\nColumn 1: 🌍🌍🌲🌍🐓🦏🐫🦏🐫🌍\nColumn 2: 🐓🐫🦏🌘🌲🐓🐌🦓🌘🐧\nColumn 3: 🌘🐓🌘🐌🐧🐧🌲🌍🦓🦏\nColumn 4: 🌘🐫🌲🌍🐓🐧🦏🐓🌘🐌\nColumn 5: 🦏🐧🐧🐌🐓🐧🐌🦏🐫🐌\nColumn 6: 🐧🐧🦓🌍🐧🐫🌍🦏🐓🌍\nColumn 7: 🐌🐓🐫🦓🐌🦏🌍🌲🦏🐫\nColumn 8: 🌘🐌🌘🐌🌍🦏🐌🦓🐫🌘\nColumn 9: 🐫🐧🐧🌍🦏🐌🌍🌍🌲🌲\nColumn 10: 🐧🌲🐌🌘🌲🐌🦓🐧🐓🦏\n\nMy counts and identifications of the lines seem correct.\n\nSo, the total number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more, is 16.\n\nActually, let me clarify whether I'm counting consecutive emojis correctly for the vertical lines. I need to make sure I have the correct understanding.\n\nFor a vertical line, I'm looking for the same emoji appearing in consecutive rows in the same column.\n\nFor example, in Column 1, rows 1-2 have 🌍🌍, which forms a vertical line.\n\nLet me check if I've made any mistakes in my vertical line count:\n\nColumn 1: 🌍🌍🌲🌍🐓🦏🐫🦏🐫🌍\nI see 🌍🌍 in rows 1-2. 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn 2: 🐓🐫🦏🌘🌲🐓🐌🦓🌘🐧\nNo consecutive emojis. 0 vertical lines.\n\nColumn 3: 🌘🐓🌘🐌🐧🐧🌲🌍🦓🦏\nI see 🐧🐧 in rows 5-6. 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn 4: 🌘🐫🌲🌍🐓🐧🦏🐓🌘🐌\nNo consecutive emojis. 0 vertical lines.\n\nColumn 5: 🦏🐧🐧🐌🐓🐧🐌🦏🐫🐌\nI see 🐧🐧 in rows 2-3. 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn 6: 🐧🐧🦓🌍🐧🐫🌍🦏🐓🌍\nI see 🐧🐧 in rows 1-2. 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn 7: 🐌🐓🐫🦓🐌🦏🌍🌲🦏🐫\nNo consecutive emojis. 0 vertical lines.\n\nColumn 8: 🌘🐌🌘🐌🌍🦏🐌🦓🐫🌘\nNo consecutive emojis. 0 vertical lines.\n\nColumn 9: 🐫🐧🐧🌍🦏🐌🌍🌍🌲🌲\nI see 🐧🐧 in rows 2-3, 🌍🌍 in rows 7-8, and 🌲🌲 in rows 9-10. 3 vertical lines.\n\nColumn 10: 🐧🌲🐌🌘🌲🐌🦓🐧🐓🦏\nThere are two 🌲 emojis, but they are not consecutive (rows 2 and 5). There are two 🐌 emojis, but they are not consecutive (rows 3 and 6). 0 vertical lines.\n\nThat's a total of 7 vertical lines, which matches my previous count.\n\nTherefore, the total count of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more, is 9 + 7 = 16.\n\nActually, while double checking, I just realized I made a mistake in reading column 5. Let's look at it again:\n\nColumn 5: 🦏🐧🐧🐌🐓🐧🐌🦏🐫🐌\nThe emojis in rows 2-3 are 🐧🐧. I counted this correctly.\n\nI'll still do a more systematic analysis of the board to make sure I haven't missed any lines or counted any lines incorrectly.\n\nBoard:\n```\n🌍🐓🌘🌘🦏🐧🐌🌘🐫🐧\n🌍🐫🐓🐫🐧🐧🐓🐌🐧🌲\n🌲🦏🌘🌲🐧🦓🐫🌘🐧🐌\n🌍🌘🐌🌍🐌🌍🦓🐌🌍🌘\n🐓🌲🐧🐓🐓🐧🐌🌍🦏🌲\n🦏🐓🐧🐧🐧🐫🦏🦏🐌🐌\n🐫🐌🌲🦏🐌🌍🌍🐌🌍🦓\n🦏🦓🌍🐓🦏🦏🌲🦓🌍🐧\n🐫🌘🦓🌘🐫🐓🦏🐫🌲🐓\n🌍🐧🦏🐌🐌🌍🐫🌘🌲🦏\n```\n\nHorizontal lines:\n\nRow 1: I see 🌘🌘 in columns 3-4. 1 horizontal line.\nRow 2: I see 🐧🐧 in columns 5-6. 1 horizontal line.\nRow 3: No consecutive emojis. 0 horizontal lines.\nRow 4: No consecutive emojis. 0 horizontal lines.\nRow 5: I see 🐓🐓 in columns 4-5. 1 horizontal line.\nRow 6: I see 🐧🐧🐧 in columns 3-5, 🦏🦏 in columns 7-8, and 🐌🐌 in columns 9-10. 3 horizontal lines.\nRow 7: I see 🌍🌍 in columns 6-7. 1 horizontal line.\nRow 8: I see 🦏🦏 in columns 5-6. 1 horizontal line.\nRow 9: No consecutive emojis. 0 horizontal lines.\nRow 10: I see 🐌🐌 in columns 4-5. 1 horizontal line.\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 9\n\nVertical lines:\n\nColumn 1: I see 🌍🌍 in rows 1-2. 1 vertical line.\nColumn 2: No consecutive emojis. 0 vertical lines.\nColumn 3: I see 🐧🐧 in rows 5-6. 1 vertical line.\nColumn 4: No consecutive emojis. 0 vertical lines.\nColumn 5: I see 🐧🐧 in rows 2-3. 1 vertical line.\nColumn 6: I see 🐧🐧 in rows 1-2. 1 vertical line.\nColumn 7: No consecutive emojis. 0 vertical lines.\nColumn 8: No consecutive emojis. 0 vertical lines.\nColumn 9: I see 🐧🐧 in rows 2-3, 🌍🌍 in rows 7-8, and 🌲🌲 in rows 9-10. 3 vertical lines.\nColumn 10: No consecutive emojis. 0 vertical lines.\n\nTotal vertical lines: 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 0 = 7\n\nTotal lines: 9 + 7 = 16\n\nBased on my analysis, there are 16 horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\n\nActually, I just realized I might have misinterpreted the board.

I correctly identified 🐏🐏 in positions 2-3.\n\nSo in total, there are 5 horizontal lines + 6 vertical lines = 11 lines of the same emoji with a length of 2 or more.\n\nActually, let me re-analyze one more time to make sure.\n\n```\n🐣🐏🐏🐣🐏🎋\n🐏🎋🐣🎋🐜🎋\n🐡🐣🐣🐣🐣🐣\n🎋🐡🐡🐣🐏🐣\n🎋🎋🐜🎋🐏🐣\n🐏🐡🎋🐡🐡🐡\n```\n\nLet's go through row by row for horizontal lines:\n\nRow 1: 🐣🐏🐏🐣🐏🎋\n    - 🐏🐏 (from index 1 to 2): 1 horizontal line\nRow 2: 🐏🎋🐣🎋🐜🎋\n    - No horizontal lines of length 2 or more\nRow 3: 🐡🐣🐣🐣🐣🐣\n    - 🐣🐣🐣🐣🐣 (from index 1 to 5): 1 horizontal line\nRow 4: 🎋🐡🐡🐣🐏🐣\n    - 🐡🐡 (from index 1 to 2): 1 horizontal line\nRow 5: 🎋🎋🐜🎋🐏🐣\n    - 🎋🎋 (from index 0 to 1): 1 horizontal line\nRow 6: 🐏🐡🎋🐡🐡🐡\n    - 🐡🐡🐡 (from index 3 to 5): 1 horizontal line\n\nSo there are 5 horizontal lines.\n\nNow let's go through column by column for vertical lines:\n\nColumn 1: 🐣🐏🐡🎋🎋🐏\n    - 🎋🎋 (rows 3-4): 1 vertical line\nColumn 2: 🐏🎋🐣🐡🎋🐡\n    - No vertical lines of length 2 or more\nColumn 3: 🐏🐣🐣🐡🐜🎋\n    - 🐣🐣 (rows 1-2): 1 vertical line\nColumn 4: 🐣🎋🐣🐣🎋🐡\n    - 🐣🐣 (rows 2-3): 1 vertical line\nColumn 5: 🐏🐜🐣🐏🐏🐡\n    - 🐏🐏 (rows 3-4): 1 vertical line\nColumn 6: 🎋🎋🐣🐣🐣🐡\n    - 🎋🎋 (rows 0-1): 1 vertical line\n    - 🐣🐣🐣 (rows 2-4): 1 vertical line\n\nSo there are 6 vertical lines.\n\nIn total, there are 5 horizontal lines + 6 vertical lines = 11 lines of the same emoji with a length of 2 or more.\n\nActually, I'm making mistakes due to the inconsistency in how I'm referencing rows and columns. Let me re-analyze one more time with a more consistent approach. I'll refer to the rows and columns by 0-indexing (starting from 0).\n\nHere's the board again:\n\n```\n🐣🐏🐏🐣🐏🎋\n🐏🎋🐣🎋🐜🎋\n🐡🐣🐣🐣🐣🐣\n🎋🐡🐡🐣🐏🐣\n🎋🎋🐜🎋🐏🐣\n🐏🐡🎋🐡🐡🐡\n```\n\nLet's go through row by row for horizontal lines:\n\nRow 0: 🐣🐏🐏🐣🐏🎋\n    - 🐏🐏 (from column 1 to 2): 1 horizontal line\nRow 1: 🐏🎋🐣🎋🐜🎋\n    - 🎋🎋 (from column 1 to 5): No, these are not adjacent.\nRow 2: 🐡🐣🐣🐣🐣🐣\n    - 🐣🐣🐣🐣🐣 (from column 1 to 5): 1 horizontal line\nRow 3: 🎋🐡🐡🐣🐏🐣\n    - 🐡🐡 (from column 1 to 2): 1 horizontal line\nRow 4: 🎋🎋🐜🎋🐏🐣\n    - 🎋🎋 (from column 0 to 1): 1 horizontal line\nRow 5: 🐏🐡🎋🐡🐡🐡\n    - 🐡🐡🐡 (from column 3 to 5): 1 horizontal line\n\nSo there are 5 horizontal lines.\n\nNow let's go through column by column for vertical lines:\n\nColumn 0: 🐣🐏🐡🎋🎋🐏\n    - 🎋🎋 (from row 3 to 4): 1 vertical line\nColumn 1: 🐏🎋🐣🐡🎋🐡\n    - No vertical lines of length 2 or more\nColumn 2: 🐏🐣🐣🐡🐜🎋\n    - 🐣🐣 (from row 1 to 2): 1 vertical line\nColumn 3: 🐣🎋🐣🐣🎋🐡\n    - 🐣🐣 (from row 2 to 3): 1 vertical line\nColumn 4: 🐏🐜🐣🐏🐏🐡\n    - 🐏🐏 (from row 3 to 4): 1 vertical line\nColumn 5: 🎋🎋🐣🐣🐣🐡\n    - 🎋🎋 (from row 0 to 1): 1 vertical line\n    - 🐣🐣🐣 (from row 2 to 4): 1 vertical line\n\nSo there are 6 vertical lines.\n\nIn total, there are 5 horizontal lines + 6 vertical lines = 11 lines of the same emoji with a length of 2 or more.\n\nActually, I think I missed a line in my analysis. Let me double-check the vertical lines by looking at the board differently:\n\nColumn 0 (first column from left): 🐣, 🐏, 🐡, 🎋, 🎋, 🐏\n    - 🎋🎋 (from row 3 to 4): 1 vertical line\nColumn 1 (second column from left): 🐏, 🎋, 🐣, 🐡, 🎋, 🐡\n    - No vertical lines of length 2 or more\nColumn 2 (third column from left): 🐏, 🐣, 🐣, 🐡, 🐜, 🎋\n    - 🐣🐣 (from row 1 to 2): 1 vertical line\nColumn 3 (fourth column from left): 🐣, 🎋, 🐣, 🐣, 🎋, 🐡\n    - 🐣🐣 (from row 2 to 3): 1 vertical line\nColumn 4 (fifth column from left): 🐏, 🐜, 🐣, 🐏, 🐏, 🐡\n    - 🐏🐏 (from row 3 to 4): 1 vertical line\nColumn 5 (sixth column from left): 🎋, 🎋, 🐣, 🐣, 🐣, 🐡\n    - 🎋🎋 (from row 0 to 1): 1 vertical line\n    - 🐣🐣🐣 (from row 2 to 4): 1 vertical line\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in column 0. Let me double check all columns by transposing the board:\n\nColumn 0: 🐣, 🐏, 🐡, 🎋, 🎋, 🐏\nColumn 1: 🐏, 🎋, 🐣, 🐡, 🎋, 🐡\nColumn 2: 🐏, 🐣, 🐣, 🐡, 🐜, 🎋\nColumn 3: 🐣, 🎋, 🐣, 🐣, 🎋, 🐡\nColumn 4: 🐏, 🐜, 🐣, 🐏, 🐏, 🐡\nColumn 5: 🎋, 🎋, 🐣, 🐣, 🐣, 🐡\n\nChecking for vertical lines of the same emoji with a length of 2 or more:\n\nColumn 0: 🐣, 🐏, 🐡, 🎋, 🎋, 🐏\n    - 🎋🎋 (from row 3 to 4): 1 vertical line\nColumn 1: 🐏, 🎋, 🐣, 🐡, 🎋, 🐡\n    - No vertical lines of length 2 or more\nColumn 2: 🐏, 🐣, 🐣, 🐡, 🐜, 🎋\n    - 🐣🐣 (from row 1 to 2): 1 vertical line\nColumn 3: 🐣, 🎋, 🐣, 🐣, 🎋, 🐡\n    - 🐣🐣 (from row 2 to 3): 1 vertical line\nColumn 4: 🐏, 🐜, 🐣, 🐏, 🐏, 🐡\n    - 🐏🐏 (from row 3 to 4): 1 vertical line\nColumn 5: 🎋, 🎋, 🐣, 🐣, 🐣, 🐡\n    - 🎋🎋 (from row 0 to 1): 1 vertical line\n    - 🐣🐣🐣 (from row 2 to 4): 1 vertical line\n\nSo there are 6 vertical lines.\n\nI just realized that I've been doing my column analysis correctly, but I made a mistake in my row analysis. Let me re-analyze the rows:\n\nRows from top to bottom:\nRow 0: 🐣🐏🐏🐣🐏🎋\nRow 1: 🐏🎋🐣🎋🐜🎋\nRow 2: 🐡🐣🐣🐣🐣🐣\nRow 3: 🎋🐡🐡🐣🐏🐣\nRow 4: 🎋🎋🐜🎋🐏🐣\nRow 5: 🐏🐡🎋🐡🐡🐡\n\nChecking for horizontal lines of the same emoji with a length of 2 or more:\n\nRow 0: 🐣🐏🐏🐣🐏🎋\n    - 🐏🐏 (from column 1 to 2): 1 horizontal line\nRow 1: 🐏🎋🐣🎋🐜🎋\n    - No horizontal lines of length 2 or more\nRow 2: 🐡🐣🐣🐣🐣🐣\n    - 🐣🐣🐣🐣🐣 (from column 1 to 5): 1 horizontal line\nRow 3: 🎋🐡🐡🐣🐏🐣\n    - 🐡🐡 (from column 1 to 2): 1 horizontal line\nRow 4: 🎋🎋🐜🎋🐏🐣\n    - 🎋🎋 (from column 0 to 1): 1 horizontal line\nRow 5: 🐏🐡🎋🐡🐡🐡\n    - 🐡🐡🐡 (from column 3 to 5): 1 horizontal line\n\nSo there are 5 horizontal lines.\n\nTherefore, the total number of lines is 5 horizontal + 6 vertical = 11 lines.\n\nActually, let me check my analysis for row 2 one more time:\n\nRow 2: 🐡🐣🐣🐣🐣🐣\nSo there's a 🐡 followed by 5 consecutive 🐣. So the line is 🐣🐣🐣🐣🐣, and I counted it correctly.\n\nSo the final answer is 11.\n\nHmm, I'm second-guessing my column analysis now. Let me make sure I understand the board structure correctly:\n\n```\n🐣🐏🐏🐣🐏🎋\n🐏🎋🐣🎋🐜🎋\n🐡🐣🐣🐣🐣🐣\n🎋🐡🐡🐣🐏🐣\n🎋🎋🐜🎋🐏🐣\n🐏🐡🎋🐡🐡🐡\n```\n\nLet me re-analyze the columns step by step, being extra careful:\n\nColumn 0 (leftmost column): [🐣, 🐏, 🐡, 🎋, 🎋, 🐏]\nI see a consecutive pair of 🎋 at positions 3-4.\n\nColumn 1: [🐏, 🎋, 🐣, 🐡, 🎋, 🐡]\nNo consecutive pairs.\n\nColumn 2: [🐏, 🐣, 🐣, 🐡, 🐜, 🎋]\nI see a consecutive pair of 🐣 at positions 1-2.\n\nColumn 3: [🐣, 🎋, 🐣, 🐣, 🎋, 🐡]\nI see a consecutive pair of 🐣 at positions 2-3.\n\nColumn 4: [🐏, 🐜, 🐣, 🐏, 🐏, 🐡]\nI see a consecutive pair of 🐏 at positions 3-4.\n\nColumn 5 (rightmost column): [🎋, 🎋, 🐣, 🐣, 🐣, 🐡]\nI see a consecutive pair of 🎋 at positions 0-1, and a consecutive triplet of 🐣 at positions 2-4.\n\nSo in total, that's 6 vertical lines. My previous calculation was correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 5 horizontal + 6 vertical = 11 lines.\n\nActually, I want to double-check my analysis of column 2:\n\nColumn 2: [🐏, 🐣, 🐣, 🐡, 🐜, 🎋]\n\nActually, I was mistaken. The elements in column 2 are the third elements in each row (using 0-based indexing):\n- Row 0: 🐏\n- Row 1: 🐣\n- Row 2: 🐣\n- Row 3: 🐡\n- Row 4: 🐜\n- Row 5: 🎋\n\nSo I do see a consecutive pair of 🐣 at rows 1-2.\n\nLet me double-check my analysis of column 3:\n\nColumn 3: [🐣, 🎋, 🐣, 🐣, 🎋, 🐡]\n\nActually, the elements in column 3 are the fourth elements in each row (using 0-based indexing):\n- Row 0: 🐣\n- Row 1: 🎋\n- Row 2: 🐣\n- Row 3: 🐣\n- Row 4: 🎋\n- Row 5: 🐡\n\nSo I do see a consecutive pair of 🐣 at rows 2-3.\n\nNow, let me double-check my analysis of column 4:\n\nColumn 4: [🐏, 🐜, 🐣, 🐏, 🐏, 🐡]\n\nActually, the elements in column 4 are the fifth elements in each row (using 0-based indexing):\n- Row 0: 🐏\n- Row 1: 🐜\n- Row 2: 🐣\n- Row 3: 🐏\n- Row 4: 🐏\n- Row 5: 🐡\n\nSo I do see a consecutive pair of 🐏 at rows 3-4.\n\nLet me double-check my analysis of column 5:\n\nColumn 5: [🎋, 🎋, 🐣, 🐣, 🐣, 🐡]\n\nActually, the elements in column 5 are the sixth elements in each row (using 0-based indexing):\n- Row 0: 🎋\n- Row 1: 🎋\n- Row 2: 🐣\n- Row 3: 🐣\n- Row 4: 🐣\n- Row 5: 🐡\n\nSo I do see a consecutive pair of 🎋 at rows 0-1, and a consecutive triplet of 🐣 at rows 2-4.\n\nSo in total, that's 6 vertical lines, which matches my previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 5 horizontal + 6 vertical = 11 lines.\n\nWait, I think I need to make a correction to my analysis of column 3:\n\nColumn 3: [🐣, 🎋, 🐣, 🐣, 🎋, 🐡]\n\nLet's double-check the elements in column 3 once more:\n- Row 0: 🐣\n- Row 1: 🎋\n- Row 2: 🐣\n- Row 3: 🐣\n- Row 4: 🎋\n- Row 5: 🐡\n\nSo there's a consecutive pair of 🐣 at rows 2-3, which I counted correctly.\n\nTherefore, my previous analysis is correct, and the final answer is 5 horizontal + 6 vertical = 11 lines.\n\nOK, I'm confident in my answer now. The total number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more, is 11.To solve this problem, I need to count all horizontal and vertical lines made up of the same emoji, where a line consists of 2 or more of the same emoji consecutively.\n\nLooking at the board:\n```\n🐣🐏🐏🐣🐏🎋\n🐏🎋🐣🎋🐜🎋\n🐡🐣🐣🐣🐣🐣\n🎋🐡🐡🐣🐏🐣\n🎋🎋🐜🎋🐏🐣\n🐏🐡🎋🐡🐡🐡\n```\n\nFirst, let me count the horizontal lines:\n\nRow 1: 🐏🐏 (positions 1-2) - 1 line\nRow 2: No horizontal lines\nRow 3: 🐣🐣🐣🐣🐣 (positions 1-5) - 1 line\nRow 4: 🐡🐡 (positions 1-2) - 1 line\nRow 5: 🎋🎋 (positions 0-1) - 1 line\nRow 6: 🐡🐡🐡 (positions 3-5) - 1 line\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 5\n\nNext, the vertical lines:\n\nColumn 1: 🎋🎋 (rows 3-4) - 1 line\nColumn 2: No vertical lines\nColumn 3: 🐣🐣 (rows 1-2) - 1 line\nColumn 4: 🐣🐣 (rows 2-3) - 1 line\nColumn 5: 🐏🐏 (rows 3-4) - 1 line\nColumn 6: 🎋🎋 (rows 0-1) - 1 line\nColumn 6: 🐣🐣🐣 (rows 2-4) - 1 line\n\nTotal vertical lines: 6\n\nAdding horizontal and vertical lines: 5 + 6 = 11\n\nAnswer: 11"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Count: 1\n- Column 5: One line of 2 🌍 emojis (positions 2-3). Count: 1\n\nTotal for vertical lines: 4\n\nActually, let me re-check the board more carefully. I'll denote positions as (row, column) where row and column are both 1-indexed.\n\nRow 1: 🐤🎁🌍🌍🐤\nThere's a line of 2 🌍 emojis at positions (1,3) and (1,4). Count: 1\n\nRow 2: 🌍🐤🎁🐤🌍\nNo lines of 2 or more of the same emoji. Count: 0\n\nRow 3: 🎁🌍🌍🌍🌍\nThere's a line of 4 🌍 emojis at positions (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), and (3,5).

Count: 1\n\nNow let's check columns:\n\nColumn 1: 🐤🌍🎁🎁🐤\nThere's a line of 2 🎁 emojis at positions (3,1) and (4,1). Count: 1\n\nColumn 2: 🎁🐤🌍🌍🎁\nThere's a line of 2 🌍 emojis at positions (3,2) and (4,2). Count: 1\n\nColumn 3: 🌍🎁🌍🌍🎁\nThere's a line of 2 🌍 emojis at positions (3,3) and (4,3). Count: 1\nThere's also a line of 2 🎁 emojis at positions (2,3) and (5,3). Wait, that's not right. The emojis at (2,3) and (5,3) are not the same type. Let me check again more carefully.\n\nI apologize for the confusion. Let me re-check the board with more precision. I'll denote the emojis more clearly:\n\nBoard:\n[1,1]🐤 [1,2]🎁 [1,3]🌍 [1,4]🌍 [1,5]🐤\n[2,1]🌍 [2,2]🐤 [2,3]🎁 [2,4]🐤 [2,5]🌍\n[3,1]🎁 [3,2]🌍 [3,3]🌍 [3,4]🌍 [3,5]🌍\n[4,1]🎁 [4,2]🌍 [4,3]🌍 [4,4]🎁 [4,5]🐤\n[5,1]🐤 [5,2]🎁 [5,3]🎁 [5,4]🎁 [5,5]🎁\n\nLet me analyze again:\n\nHorizontal Lines:\n- Row 1: 🌍🌍 at positions (1,3) and (1,4). Count: 1\n- Row 2: No lines of 2 or more. Count: 0\n- Row 3: 🌍🌍🌍🌍 at positions (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), and (3,5). Count: 1\n- Row 4: 🌍🌍 at positions (4,2) and (4,3). Count: 1\n- Row 5: 🎁🎁🎁🎁 at positions (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), and (5,5). Count: 1\n\nTotal for horizontal lines: 4\n\nVertical Lines:\n- Column 1: 🎁🎁 at positions (3,1) and (4,1). Count: 1\n- Column 2: 🌍🌍 at positions (3,2) and (4,2). Count: 1\n- Column 3: 🌍🌍 at positions (3,3) and (4,3). Count: 1\n- Column 4: No lines of 2 or more of the same emoji. Wait, I missed one: 🎁🎁 at positions (4,4) and (5,4). Count: 1\n- Column 5: 🌍🌍 at positions (2,5) and (3,5). Count: 1\n\nLet me double-check column 4 again: \nColumn 4: 🌍 (1,4), 🐤 (2,4), 🌍 (3,4), 🎁 (4,4), 🎁 (5,4). There's a line of 2 🎁 emojis at positions (4,4) and (5,4). Count: 1\n\nTotal for vertical lines: 5\n\nOverall total: 4 + 5 = 9 lines.\n\nActually, let me verify each of the columns again just to be sure. As a sanity check, let's see if I can trace the original board back from my labeled board:\n\n[1,1]🐤 [1,2]🎁 [1,3]🌍 [1,4]🌍 [1,5]🐤 -> 🐤🎁🌍🌍🐤\n[2,1]🌍 [2,2]🐤 [2,3]🎁 [2,4]🐤 [2,5]🌍 -> 🌍🐤🎁🐤🌍\n[3,1]🎁 [3,2]🌍 [3,3]🌍 [3,4]🌍 [3,5]🌍 -> 🎁🌍🌍🌍🌍\n[4,1]🎁 [4,2]🌍 [4,3]🌍 [4,4]🎁 [4,5]🐤 -> 🎁🌍🌍🎁🐤\n[5,1]🐤 [5,2]🎁 [5,3]🎁 [5,4]🎁 [5,5]🎁 -> 🐤🎁🎁🎁🎁\n\nThat looks right. Now let's check vertical lines systematically:\n\nColumn 1: 🐤 (1,1), 🌍 (2,1), 🎁 (3,1), 🎁 (4,1), 🐤 (5,1)\nThere's a line of 2 🎁 emojis at positions (3,1) and (4,1). Count: 1\n\nColumn 2: 🎁 (1,2), 🐤 (2,2), 🌍 (3,2), 🌍 (4,2), 🎁 (5,2)\nThere's a line of 2 🌍 emojis at positions (3,2) and (4,2). Count: 1\n\nColumn 3: 🌍 (1,3), 🎁 (2,3), 🌍 (3,3), 🌍 (4,3), 🎁 (5,3)\nThere's a line of 2 🌍 emojis at positions (3,3) and (4,3). Count: 1\n\nColumn 4: 🌍 (1,4), 🐤 (2,4), 🌍 (3,4), 🎁 (4,4), 🎁 (5,4)\nThere's a line of 2 🎁 emojis at positions (4,4) and (5,4). Count: 1\n\nColumn 5: 🐤 (1,5), 🌍 (2,5), 🌍 (3,5), 🐤 (4,5), 🎁 (5,5)\nThere's a line of 2 🌍 emojis at positions (2,5) and (3,5). Count: 1\n\nTotal for vertical lines: 5\n\nLet me make one last check on column 5:\nColumn 5: 🐤 (1,5), 🌍 (2,5), 🌍 (3,5), 🐤 (4,5), 🎁 (5,5)\nYes, there is a line of 2 🌍 emojis at positions (2,5) and (3,5). Count: 1\n\nOverall total: 4 (horizontal) + 5 (vertical) = 9 lines.\n\nActually, there's another aspect I should double-check: column 3. Let me check the original board again for column 3:\n\nColumn 3 from the original board: 🌍 (row 1), 🎁 (row 2), 🌍 (row 3), 🌍 (row 4), 🎁 (row 5)\n\nI need to check if there's a line of 2 or more of the same emoji. Looking at positions (3,3) and (4,3), they are both 🌍, so there's a line of length 2 here. That's the only line in column 3.\n\nMy final count is:\n- 4 horizontal lines\n- 5 vertical lines\nTotal: 9 lines\n\nActually, wait. Let me verify the line in column 5 again by looking at the original board:\n\nBoard:\n🐤🎁🌍🌍🐤\n🌍🐤🎁🐤🌍\n🎁🌍🌍🌍🌍\n🎁🌍🌍🎁🐤\n🐤🎁🎁🎁🎁\n\nColumn 5: 🐤, 🌍, 🌍, 🐤, 🎁\n\nSo, in column 5, there's a line of 2 🌍 emojis at positions (2,5) and (3,5). That's correct, and the count is 1 for column 5.\n\nMy final count remains the same:\n- 4 horizontal lines\n- 5 vertical lines\nTotal: 9 lines\n\nLet me actually make a more visual representation to make sure.\n\nOriginal board:\n🐤🎁🌍🌍🐤\n🌍🐤🎁🐤🌍\n🎁🌍🌍🌍🌍\n🎁🌍🌍🎁🐤\n🐤🎁🎁🎁🎁\n\nHorizontal lines:\nRow 1: 🐤🎁[🌍🌍]🐤 (1 line of 2 🌍)\nRow 2: 🌍🐤🎁🐤🌍 (no lines)\nRow 3: 🎁[🌍🌍🌍🌍] (1 line of 4 🌍)\nRow 4: 🎁[🌍🌍]🎁🐤 (1 line of 2 🌍)\nRow 5: 🐤[🎁🎁🎁🎁] (1 line of 4 🎁)\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 4\n\nVertical lines:\nColumn 1: 🐤🌍[🎁🎁]🐤 (1 line of 2 🎁)\nColumn 2: 🎁🐤[🌍🌍]🎁 (1 line of 2 🌍)\nColumn 3: 🌍🎁[🌍🌍]🎁 (1 line of 2 🌍)\nColumn 4: 🌍🐤🌍[🎁🎁] (1 line of 2 🎁)\nColumn 5: 🐤[🌍🌍]🐤🎁 (1 line of 2 🌍)\n\nTotal vertical lines: 5\n\nTotal lines: 4 + 5 = 9\n\nSo the answer is 9.\n\nActually, let me double check column 5 one more time to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nOriginal board:\n🐤🎁🌍🌍🐤\n🌍🐤🎁🐤🌍\n🎁🌍🌍🌍🌍\n🎁🌍🌍🎁🐤\n🐤🎁🎁🎁🎁\n\nColumn 5 consists of these emojis: 🐤, 🌍, 🌍, 🐤, 🎁\n\nGoing from top to bottom:\nRow 1, Column 5: 🐤\nRow 2, Column 5: 🌍\nRow 3, Column 5: 🌍\nRow 4, Column 5: 🐤\nRow 5, Column 5: 🎁\n\nI see a line of 2 consecutive 🌍 emojis at positions (2,5) and (3,5). So there's 1 line in column 5, and my count is correct.\n\nThe final answer is 9 lines.# Counting Horizontal and Vertical Lines in the Emoji Board\n\nI need to count all horizontal and vertical lines of the same emoji, where a line must have a length of 2 or more emojis.\n\nLet me analyze the board:\n```\n🐤🎁🌍🌍🐤\n🌍🐤🎁🐤🌍\n🎁🌍🌍🌍🌍\n🎁🌍🌍🎁🐤\n🐤🎁🎁🎁🎁\n```\n\n## Horizontal Lines:\n- Row 1: 🌍🌍 (one line of length 2)\n- Row 2: No lines\n- Row 3: 🌍🌍🌍🌍 (one line of length 4)\n- Row 4: 🌍🌍 (one line of length 2)\n- Row 5: 🎁🎁🎁🎁 (one line of length 4)\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 4\n\n## Vertical Lines:\n- Column 1: 🎁🎁 (one line of length 2)\n- Column 2: 🌍🌍 (one line of length 2)\n- Column 3: 🌍🌍 (one line of length 2)\n- Column 4: 🎁🎁 (one line of length 2)\n- Column 5: 🌍🌍 (one line of length 2)\n\nTotal vertical lines: 5\n\n## Total Count:\n4 (horizontal) + 5 (vertical) = 9 lines\n\nAnswer: 9"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

That's 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow 7:\nNo consecutive emojis.\n\nSo far, we have 5 horizontal lines.\n\nNow, let's identify the vertical lines:\n\nColumn 1:\nNo consecutive emojis.\n\nColumn 2:\nWe have \"😆😆\" at positions (4, 5). That's 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn 3:\nNo consecutive emojis.\n\nColumn 4:\nWe have \"🦏🦏\" at positions (3, 4). That's 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn 5:\nNo consecutive emojis.\n\nColumn 6:\nNo consecutive emojis.\n\nColumn 7:\nNo consecutive emojis.\n\nSo, we have 2 vertical lines.\n\nWait, I think I'm making a mistake in identifying the rows and columns. Let me redo this.\n\nThe board has 7 rows and 7 columns. I'll number the rows from 0 to 6 (top to bottom) and columns from 0 to 6 (left to right).\n\nHere's the board again:\n```\n🦒😆🐯🌴🐯😆☄️\n🦏🐯🦒☄️🦏🦏🦏\n🌴☄️☄️🦏🦒🌴🌴\n☄️😆🦢🦏🐯🦢🦏\n🦒😆🌴🐯🦒🐯🌴\n😆🦒🦢🦢😆🦒😆\n🌴😆🦒🦏🦢☄️🐯\n```\n\nLet me check row by row for horizontal lines (consecutive same emojis):\n\nRow 0:\nNo consecutive emojis.\n\nRow 1:\n\"🦏🦏🦏\" in columns 4, 5, 6. That's 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow 2:\n\"☄️☄️\" in columns 1, 2 and \"🌴🌴\" in columns 5, 6. That's 2 horizontal lines.\n\nRow 3:\n\"🦢🦢\" in columns 5, 6. Wait, column 5 has a 🐯 and column 6 has a 🦢. There's no horizontal line here.\n\nHmm, I think I'm reading the board incorrectly. Let me rerepresent the board to ensure clarity:\n\nRow 0: 🦒 😆 🐯 🌴 🐯 😆 ☄️\nRow 1: 🦏 🐯 🦒 ☄️ 🦏 🦏 🦏\nRow 2: 🌴 ☄️ ☄️ 🦏 🦒 🌴 🌴\nRow 3: ☄️ 😆 🦢 🦏 🐯 🦢 🦏\nRow 4: 🦒 😆 🌴 🐯 🦒 🐯 🌴\nRow 5: 😆 🦒 🦢 🦢 😆 🦒 😆\nRow 6: 🌴 😆 🦒 🦏 🦢 ☄️ 🐯\n\nNow, let me check for horizontal lines:\n\nRow 0: No consecutive emojis.\n\nRow 1: \"🦏🦏🦏\" in columns 4, 5, 6. That's 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow 2: \"☄️☄️\" in columns 1, 2 and \"🌴🌴\" in columns 5, 6. That's 2 horizontal lines.\n\nRow 3: \"🦢🦢\" in columns 2, 3. Wait, that's not right. Row 3, columns 2 and 3 are \"🦢\" and \"🦏\". There's no horizontal line here.\nLet me check Row 3 again: [☄️, 😆, 🦢, 🦏, 🐯, 🦢, 🦏]. No consecutive emojis.\n\nRow 4: No consecutive emojis.\n\nRow 5: \"🦢🦢\" in columns 2, 3 and \"😆😆\" in columns 4, 6. That's 1 horizontal line for \"🦢🦢\".\nLet me check Row 5 again: [😆, 🦒, 🦢, 🦢, 😆, 🦒, 😆]. We have \"🦢🦢\" at columns 2, 3. That's 1 horizontal line. \nBut we don't have \"😆😆\" consecutively. We have \"😆\" at columns 0, 4, and 6. So only 1 horizontal line in this row.\n\nRow 6: No consecutive emojis.\n\nSo far, we have 4 horizontal lines.\n\nNow, let's check for vertical lines:\n\nColumn 0:\n[🦒, 🦏, 🌴, ☄️, 🦒, 😆, 🌴]. No consecutive emojis.\n\nColumn 1:\n[😆, 🐯, ☄️, 😆, 😆, 🦒, 😆]. We have \"😆😆\" at rows 3, 4 and \"😆😆\" at rows 5, 6. That's 2 vertical lines.\nHmm, let me check again. Column 1: [😆, 🐯, ☄️, 😆, 😆, 🦒, 😆]. We have \"😆😆\" at rows 3, 4. That's 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn 2:\n[🐯, 🦒, ☄️, 🦢, 🌴, 🦢, 🦒]. No consecutive emojis.\n\nColumn 3:\n[🌴, ☄️, 🦏, 🦏, 🐯, 🦢, 🦏]. We have \"🦏🦏\" at rows 2, 3. That's 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn 4:\n[🐯, 🦏, 🦒, 🐯, 🦒, 😆, 🦢]. No consecutive emojis.\n\nColumn 5:\n[😆, 🦏, 🌴, 🦢, 🐯, 🦒, ☄️]. No consecutive emojis.\n\nColumn 6:\n[☄️, 🦏, 🌴, 🦏, 🌴, 😆, 🐯]. No consecutive emojis.\n\nSo, we have 2 vertical lines.\n\nIn total, we have 4 + 2 = 6 lines.\n\nBut I think I might be mistaken. Let me visually represent the board and check again:\n\nRow 0: 🦒 😆 🐯 🌴 🐯 😆 ☄️\nRow 1: 🦏 🐯 🦒 ☄️ 🦏 🦏 🦏\nRow 2: 🌴 ☄️ ☄️ 🦏 🦒 🌴 🌴\nRow 3: ☄️ 😆 🦢 🦏 🐯 🦢 🦏\nRow 4: 🦒 😆 🌴 🐯 🦒 🐯 🌴\nRow 5: 😆 🦒 🦢 🦢 😆 🦒 😆\nRow 6: 🌴 😆 🦒 🦏 🦢 ☄️ 🐯\n\nHorizontal lines:\nRow 0: No consecutive emojis.\nRow 1: \"🦏🦏🦏\" in columns 4, 5, 6. That's 1 horizontal line.\nRow 2: \"☄️☄️\" in columns 1, 2 and \"🌴🌴\" in columns 5, 6. That's 2 horizontal lines.\nRow 3: No consecutive emojis.\nRow 4: No consecutive emojis.\nRow 5: \"🦢🦢\" in columns 2, 3. That's 1 horizontal line.\nRow 6: No consecutive emojis.\n\nSo, we have 4 horizontal lines.\n\nVertical lines:\nColumn 0: No consecutive emojis.\nColumn 1: \"😆😆\" in rows 3, 4. That's 1 vertical line.\nColumn 2: No consecutive emojis.\nColumn 3: \"🦏🦏\" in rows 2, 3. That's 1 vertical line.\nColumn 4: \"🦒🦒\" in rows 2, 4. Wait, that's not consecutive. No vertical line here.\nColumn 5: No consecutive emojis.\nColumn 6: \"🦏🦏\" in rows 1, 3 and \"🌴🌴\" in rows 2, 4. Wait, Row 1, Column 6 is 🦏 and Row 3, Column 6 is 🦏. That's not consecutive.\n\nLet me check column 6 again: [☄️, 🦏, 🌴, 🦏, 🌴, 😆, 🐯]. No consecutive emojis.\n\nSo, we have 2 vertical lines.\n\nIn total, we have 4 + 2 = 6 lines.\n\nHmm, I think I might still be making a mistake. Let me go through the board carefully:\n\nRow 0: 🦒 😆 🐯 🌴 🐯 😆 ☄️\nRow 1: 🦏 🐯 🦒 ☄️ 🦏 🦏 🦏\nRow 2: 🌴 ☄️ ☄️ 🦏 🦒 🌴 🌴\nRow 3: ☄️ 😆 🦢 🦏 🐯 🦢 🦏\nRow 4: 🦒 😆 🌴 🐯 🦒 🐯 🌴\nRow 5: 😆 🦒 🦢 🦢 😆 🦒 😆\nRow 6: 🌴 😆 🦒 🦏 🦢 ☄️ 🐯\n\nHorizontal lines (consecutive same emojis in a row):\nRow 0: No consecutive emojis.\nRow 1: \"🦏🦏🦏\" in columns 4, 5, 6. That's 1 horizontal line.\nRow 2: \"☄️☄️\" in columns 1, 2 and \"🌴🌴\" in columns 5, 6. That's 2 horizontal lines.\nRow 3: No consecutive emojis.\nRow 4: No consecutive emojis.\nRow 5: \"🦢🦢\" in columns 2, 3. That's 1 horizontal line.\nRow 6: No consecutive emojis.\n\nSo, we have 4 horizontal lines.\n\nVertical lines (consecutive same emojis in a column):\nColumn 0: No consecutive emojis.\nColumn 1: \"😆😆\" in rows 3, 4. That's 1 vertical line.\nColumn 2: No consecutive emojis.\nColumn 3: \"🦏🦏\" in rows 2, 3. That's 1 vertical line.\nColumn 4: No consecutive emojis.\nColumn 5: No consecutive emojis.\nColumn 6: No consecutive emojis.\n\nSo, we have 2 vertical lines.\n\nIn total, we have 4 + 2 = 6 lines.\n\nHang on, I think I've been misrepresenting rows and columns, which has caused my confusion.\n\nLet's be explicit: The board is a 7x7 grid, so I'll denote the position as (row, column) using 0-indexing (starting from 0):\n\n(0,0): 🦒  (0,1): 😆  (0,2): 🐯  (0,3): 🌴  (0,4): 🐯  (0,5): 😆  (0,6): ☄️\n(1,0): 🦏  (1,1): 🐯  (1,2): 🦒  (1,3): ☄️  (1,4): 🦏  (1,5): 🦏  (1,6): 🦏\n(2,0): 🌴  (2,1): ☄️  (2,2): ☄️  (2,3): 🦏  (2,4): 🦒  (2,5): 🌴  (2,6): 🌴\n(3,0): ☄️  (3,1): 😆  (3,2): 🦢  (3,3): 🦏  (3,4): 🐯  (3,5): 🦢  (3,6): 🦏\n(4,0): 🦒  (4,1): 😆  (4,2): 🌴  (4,3): 🐯  (4,4): 🦒  (4,5): 🐯  (4,6): 🌴\n(5,0): 😆  (5,1): 🦒  (5,2): 🦢  (5,3): 🦢  (5,4): 😆  (5,5): 🦒  (5,6): 😆\n(6,0): 🌴  (6,1): 😆  (6,2): 🦒  (6,3): 🦏  (6,4): 🦢  (6,5): ☄️  (6,6): 🐯\n\nNow, let's check for horizontal lines:\n\nRow 0: No consecutive emojis.\nRow 1: \"🦏🦏🦏\" in positions (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). That's 1 horizontal line.\nRow 2: \"☄️☄️\" in positions (2,1), (2,2) and \"🌴🌴\" in positions (2,5), (2,6). That's 2 horizontal lines.\nRow 3: No consecutive emojis.\nRow 4: No consecutive emojis.\nRow 5: \"🦢🦢\" in positions (5,2), (5,3). That's 1 horizontal line.\nRow 6: No consecutive emojis.\n\nSo, we have 4 horizontal lines.\n\nNow, let's check for vertical lines:\n\nColumn 0: No consecutive emojis.\nColumn 1: \"😆😆\" in positions (3,1), (4,1). That's 1 vertical line.\nColumn 2: No consecutive emojis.\nColumn 3: \"🦏🦏\" in positions (2,3), (3,3). That's 1 vertical line.\nColumn 4: No consecutive emojis.\nColumn 5: No consecutive emojis.\nColumn 6: No consecutive emojis.\n\nSo, we have 2 vertical lines.\n\nIn total, we have 4 + 2 = 6 lines.\n\nActually, I'm still making an error in the vertical line check. Let me double check all the vertical lines:\n\nColumn 0:\n(0,0): 🦒\n(1,0): 🦏\n(2,0): 🌴\n(3,0): ☄️\n(4,0): 🦒\n(5,0): 😆\n(6,0): 🌴\nNo consecutive emojis.\n\nColumn 1:\n(0,1): 😆\n(1,1): 🐯\n(2,1): ☄️\n(3,1): 😆\n(4,1): 😆\n(5,1): 🦒\n(6,1): 😆\nWe have \"😆😆\" at positions (3,1), (4,1) and \"😆😆\" at positions (6,1) and the previous. But position (5,1) is 🦒, not 😆. So, there's only 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn 2:\n(0,2): 🐯\n(1,2): 🦒\n(2,2): ☄️\n(3,2): 🦢\n(4,2): 🌴\n(5,2): 🦢\n(6,2): 🦒\nNo consecutive emojis.\n\nColumn 3:\n(0,3): 🌴\n(1,3): ☄️\n(2,3): 🦏\n(3,3): 🦏\n(4,3): 🐯\n(5,3): 🦢\n(6,3): 🦏\nWe have \"🦏🦏\" at positions (2,3), (3,3). That's 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn 4:\n(0,4): 🐯\n(1,4): 🦏\n(2,4): 🦒\n(3,4): 🐯\n(4,4): 🦒\n(5,4): 😆\n(6,4): 🦢\nNo consecutive emojis.\n\nColumn 5:\n(0,5): 😆\n(1,5): 🦏\n(2,5): 🌴\n(3,5): 🦢\n(4,5): 🐯\n(5,5): 🦒\n(6,5): ☄️\nNo consecutive emojis.\n\nColumn 6:\n(0,6): ☄️\n(1,6): 🦏\n(2,6): 🌴\n(3,6): 🦏\n(4,6): 🌴\n(5,6): 😆\n(6,6): 🐯\nNo consecutive emojis.\n\nSo, we have 2 vertical lines.\n\nIn total, we have 4 + 2 = 6 lines.\n\nWait, I'm making another error. Let's check Column 6 more carefully:\n\n(0,6): ☄️\n(1,6): 🦏\n(2,6): 🌴\n(3,6): 🦏\n(4,6): 🌴\n(5,6): 😆\n(6,6): 🐯\n\nThere are no consecutive emojis here.\n\nI'm pretty sure the total is 6 lines now. Let me recheck with a different approach.\n\nHorizontal lines (2 or more of the same emoji in a row):\n1. Row 1: \"🦏🦏🦏\" in columns 4, 5, 6. That's 1 horizontal line.\n2. Row 2: \"☄️☄️\" in columns 1, 2. That's 1 horizontal line.\n3. Row 2: \"🌴🌴\" in columns 5, 6. That's 1 horizontal line.\n4. Row 5: \"🦢🦢\" in columns 2, 3. That's 1 horizontal line.\n\nVertical lines (2 or more of the same emoji in a column):\n1. Column 1: \"😆😆\" in rows 3, 4. That's 1 vertical line.\n2. Column 3: \"🦏🦏\" in rows 2, 3. That's 1 vertical line.\n\nIn total, we have 4 + 2 = 6 lines.\n\nActually, let me check for one more case. Let's check if there's a \"🌴🌴\" line in column 6 spanning rows 2 and 4:\n\n(2,6): 🌴\n(3,6): 🦏\n(4,6): 🌴\n\nSince there's a 🦏 in between, this doesn't form a line.\n\nI'm confident that the answer is 6.\n\nActually, I realize I'm still making a mistake. Let me show a better representation of the board:\n\n🦒😆🐯🌴🐯😆☄️\n🦏🐯🦒☄️🦏🦏🦏\n🌴☄️☄️🦏🦒🌴🌴\n☄️😆🦢🦏🐯🦢🦏\n🦒😆🌴🐯🦒🐯🌴\n😆🦒🦢🦢😆🦒😆\n🌴😆🦒🦏🦢☄️🐯\n\nThis should be a 7x7 board.\n\nLet's check for horizontal lines (2 or more of the same emoji in a row):\n\nRow 0: [🦒, 😆, 🐯, 🌴, 🐯, 😆, ☄️]\nNo consecutive emojis.\n\nRow 1: [🦏, 🐯, 🦒, ☄️, 🦏, 🦏, 🦏]\n\"🦏🦏🦏\" in columns 4, 5, 6. That's 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow 2: [🌴, ☄️, ☄️, 🦏, 🦒, 🌴, 🌴]\n\"☄️☄️\" in columns 1, 2 and \"🌴🌴\" in columns 5, 6. That's 2 horizontal lines.\n\nRow 3: [☄️, 😆, 🦢, 🦏, 🐯, 🦢, 🦏]\nNo consecutive emojis.\n\nRow 4: [🦒, 😆, 🌴, 🐯, 🦒, 🐯, 🌴]\nNo consecutive emojis.\n\nRow 5: [😆, 🦒, 🦢, 🦢, 😆, 🦒, 😆]\n\"🦢🦢\" in columns 2, 3. That's 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow 6: [🌴, 😆, 🦒, 🦏, 🦢, ☄️, 🐯]\nNo consecutive emojis.\n\nSo, we have 4 horizontal lines.\n\nNow, let's check for vertical lines (2 or more of the same emoji in a column):\n\nColumn 0: [🦒, 🦏, 🌴, ☄️, 🦒, 😆, 🌴]\nNo consecutive emojis.\n\nColumn 1: [😆, 🐯, ☄️, 😆, 😆, 🦒, 😆]\n\"😆😆\" in rows 3, 4. That's 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn 2: [🐯, 🦒, ☄️, 🦢, 🌴, 🦢, 🦒]\nNo consecutive emojis.\n\nColumn 3: [🌴, ☄️, 🦏, 🦏, 🐯, 🦢, 🦏]\n\"🦏🦏\" in rows 2, 3. That's 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn 4: [🐯, 🦏, 🦒, 🐯, 🦒, 😆, 🦢]\nNo consecutive emojis.\n\nColumn 5: [😆, 🦏, 🌴, 🦢, 🐯, 🦒, ☄️]\nNo consecutive emojis.\n\nColumn 6: [☄️, 🦏, 🌴, 🦏, 🌴, 😆, 🐯]\nNo consecutive emojis.\n\nSo, we have 2 vertical lines.\n\nIn total, we have 4 + 2 = 6 lines.\n\nBut I think I've made a mistake once again in how I'm representing the board. Let me be extremely careful:\n\nThe board is:\n```\n🦒😆🐯🌴🐯😆☄️\n🦏🐯🦒☄️🦏🦏🦏\n🌴☄️☄️🦏🦒🌴🌴\n☄️😆🦢🦏🐯🦢🦏\n🦒😆🌴🐯🦒🐯🌴\n😆🦒🦢🦢😆🦒😆\n🌴😆🦒🦏🦢☄️🐯\n```\n\nI'll label the rows from 0 to 6 (top to bottom) and columns from 0 to 6 (left to right).\n\nLet's check row by row for horizontal lines (2 or more of the same emoji consecutively in a row):\n\nRow 0: [🦒, 😆, 🐯, 🌴, 🐯, 😆, ☄️]\nNo consecutive emojis.\n\nRow 1: [🦏, 🐯, 🦒, ☄️, 🦏, 🦏, 🦏]\n\"🦏🦏🦏\" in columns 4, 5, 6. That's 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow 2: [🌴, ☄️, ☄️, 🦏, 🦒, 🌴, 🌴]\n\"☄️☄️\" in columns 1, 2 and \"🌴🌴\" in columns 5, 6. That's 2 horizontal lines.\n\nRow 3: [☄️, 😆, 🦢, 🦏, 🐯, 🦢, 🦏]\nNo consecutive emojis.\n\nRow 4: [🦒, 😆, 🌴, 🐯, 🦒, 🐯, 🌴]\nNo consecutive emojis.\n\nRow 5: [😆, 🦒, 🦢, 🦢, 😆, 🦒, 😆]\n\"🦢🦢\" in columns 2, 3. That's 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow 6: [🌴, 😆, 🦒, 🦏, 🦢, ☄️, 🐯]\nNo consecutive emojis.\n\nSo, we have 4 horizontal lines.\n\nNow, let's check column by column for vertical lines (2 or more of the same emoji consecutively in a column):\n\nColumn 0:\nRow 0: 🦒\nRow 1: 🦏\nRow 2: 🌴\nRow 3: ☄️\nRow 4: 🦒\nRow 5: 😆\nRow 6: 🌴\nNo consecutive emojis.\n\nColumn 1:\nRow 0: 😆\nRow 1: 🐯\nRow 2: ☄️\nRow 3: 😆\nRow 4: 😆\nRow 5: 🦒\nRow 6: 😆\n\"😆😆\" in rows 3, 4. That's 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn 2:\nRow 0: 🐯\nRow 1: 🦒\nRow 2: ☄️\nRow 3: 🦢\nRow 4: 🌴\nRow 5: 🦢\nRow 6: 🦒\nNo consecutive emojis.\n\nColumn 3:\nRow 0: 🌴\nRow 1: ☄️\nRow 2: 🦏\nRow 3: 🦏\nRow 4: 🐯\nRow 5: 🦢\nRow 6: 🦏\n\"🦏🦏\" in rows 2, 3. That's 1 vertical line.\n\nColumn 4:\nRow 0: 🐯\nRow 1: 🦏\nRow 2: 🦒\nRow 3: 🐯\nRow 4: 🦒\nRow 5: 😆\nRow 6: 🦢\nNo consecutive emojis.\n\nColumn 5:\nRow 0: 😆\nRow 1: 🦏\nRow 2: 🌴\nRow 3: 🦢\nRow 4: 🐯\nRow 5: 🦒\nRow 6: ☄️\nNo consecutive emojis.\n\nColumn 6:\nRow 0: ☄️\nRow 1: 🦏\nRow 2: 🌴\nRow 3: 🦏\nRow 4: 🌴\nRow 5: 😆\nRow 6: 🐯\nNo consecutive emojis.\n\nSo, we have 2 vertical lines.\n\nIn total, we have 4 + 2 = 6 lines.\n\nChecking one more time for Row 3:\n\nRow 3: [☄️, 😆, 🦢, 🦏, 🐯, 🦢, 🦏]\nNo, there's no \"🦢🦢\" in columns 2 and 5; they're not consecutive.\n\nAnd for Column 6:\n\nColumn 6: [☄️, 🦏, 🌴, 🦏, 🌴, 😆, 🐯]\nNo, there's no \"🦏🦏\" or \"🌴🌴\" consecutively.\n\nI'm sure the total is 6 lines.\n\nActually, let me read the problem more carefully.\n\nThe problem states: \"Your task is to count the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\"\n\nI think my interpretation is correct. We're looking for lines (horizontal or vertical) where the same emoji appears consecutively 2 or more times.\n\nLet's list the lines we've found:\n\n1. Row 1: \"🦏🦏🦏\" in columns 4, 5, 6. \n2. Row 2: \"☄️☄️\" in columns 1, 2.\n3. Row 2: \"🌴🌴\" in columns 5, 6.\n4. Row 5: \"🦢🦢\" in columns 2, 3.\n5. Column 1: \"😆😆\" in rows 3, 4.\n6. Column 3: \"🦏🦏\" in rows 2, 3.\n\nSo, the total is 6 lines.\n\nI'm confident that this is the correct answer.To solve this problem, I need to count the horizontal or vertical lines with the same emoji of length 2 or more.\n\nHere's the board:\n```\n🦒😆🐯🌴🐯😆☄️\n🦏🐯🦒☄️🦏🦏🦏\n🌴☄️☄️🦏🦒🌴🌴\n☄️😆🦢🦏🐯🦢🦏\n🦒😆🌴🐯🦒🐯🌴\n😆🦒🦢🦢😆🦒😆\n🌴😆🦒🦏🦢☄️🐯\n```\n\nLet me analyze the board row by row and column by column:\n\nHorizontal lines:\n1.

No these are not adjacent, so no lines.\nNo horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 6:\n- 🕷🕷 at positions (6,2) and (6,3)\nThat's 1 horizontal line.\n\nRow 7:\n- 🦩🦩 at positions (7,0) and (7,1)\n- 🐮🐮 at positions (7,4) and (7,5)\nThat's 2 horizontal lines.\n\nRow 8:\n- 🦋🦋 at positions (8,0) and (8,1)\n- 🦋🦋 at positions (8,5) and (8,6)\n- 🐛🐛 at positions (8,8) and (8,9)\nThat's 3 horizontal lines.\n\nRow 9:\nNo horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 2 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 0 = 11.\n\nVertical lines:\n\nColumn 0:\n- 🐛🐛 at positions (0,0) and (1,0)\n- 💫💫 at positions (5,0) and (6,0)\nThat's 2 vertical lines.\n\nColumn 1:\n- 🦩🦩 at positions (7,1) and (8,1). Wait, actually, position (8,1) is 🦋 not 🦩. So no line here.\nNo vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 2:\n- 🕷🕷 at positions (2,2) and (6,2). No, these are not adjacent, so no line.\n- 🐮🐮 at positions (0,2) and (1,2). Actually, position (1,2) is 💫 not 🐮. So no line here.\nNo vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nI think I need to be more methodical. Let me examine the board column by column.\n\nColumn 0:\n- 🐛 at positions (0,0) and (1,0). That's a line of length 2.\n- 🐛 at positions (3,0). This is not part of a line of length 2 or more.\n- 🐮 at positions (4,0). This is not part of a line of length 2 or more.\n- 💫 at positions (5,0) and (6,0). That's a line of length 2.\n- 🦩 at positions (7,0). This is not part of a line of length 2 or more.\n- 🦋 at positions (8,0). This is not part of a line of length 2 or more.\n- 🕷 at positions (9,0). This is not part of a line of length 2 or more.\nSo we have 2 vertical lines in column 0.\n\nColumn 1:\n- 🦩 at positions (0,1). This is not part of a line of length 2 or more.\n- 🐮 at positions (1,1). This is not part of a line of length 2 or more.\n- 🦕 at positions (2,1). This is not part of a line of length 2 or more.\n- 🐛 at positions (3,1). This is not part of a line of length 2 or more.\n- 🦕 at positions (4,1). This is not part of a line of length 2 or more.\n- 🐜 at positions (5,1). This is not part of a line of length 2 or more.\n- 🐮 at positions (6,1). This is not part of a line of length 2 or more.\n- 🦩 at positions (7,1) and there's 🦋 at (8,1), which doesn't match, and 🐛 at (9,1), so no line.\n- 🦋 at positions (8,1). This is not part of a line of length 2 or more.\n- 🐛 at positions (9,1). This is not part of a line of length 2 or more.\nSo there are no vertical lines in column 1.\n\nActually, let me try a more straightforward approach by looking at each emoji type and finding all the horizontal and vertical lines for that emoji.\n\nSince there are several emojis, let's go through them one by one.\n\nFor the 🐛 emoji:\nHorizontal lines:\n- Row 3: positions (0, 1) - length 2\n- Row 8: positions (8, 9) - length 2\nThat's 2 horizontal lines.\n\nVertical lines:\n- Column 0: positions (0, 1) - length 2\nThat's 1 vertical line.\n\nFor the 🦩 emoji:\nHorizontal lines:\n- Row 7: positions (0, 1) - length 2\nThat's 1 horizontal line.\n\nVertical lines:\nNo vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nFor the 🐮 emoji:\nHorizontal lines:\n- Row 0: positions (2, 3) - length 2\n- Row 0: positions (8, 9) - length 2\n- Row 7: positions (4, 5) - length 2\nThat's 3 horizontal lines.\n\nVertical lines:\nNo vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nFor the 💫 emoji:\nHorizontal lines:\nNo horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nVertical lines:\n- Column 0: positions (5, 6) - length 2\nThat's 1 vertical line.\n\nFor the 🐗 emoji:\nHorizontal lines:\nNo horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nVertical lines:\nNo vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nFor the 🐜 emoji:\nHorizontal lines:\n- Row 3: positions (7, 8) - length 2\nThat's 1 horizontal line.\n\nVertical lines:\nNo vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nFor the 🕷 emoji:\nHorizontal lines:\n- Row 2: positions (2, 3) - length 2\n- Row 6: positions (2, 3) - length 2\nThat's 2 horizontal lines.\n\nVertical lines:\nNo vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nFor the 🦕 emoji:\nHorizontal lines:\nNo horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nVertical lines:\nNo vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nFor the 🦋 emoji:\nHorizontal lines:\n- Row 8: positions (0, 1) - length 2\n- Row 8: positions (5, 6) - length 2\nThat's 2 horizontal lines.\n\nVertical lines:\nNo vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nHmm, this approach also seems to be leading to errors. Let me re-examine the board more carefully, going row by row and column by column, and marking all the consecutive horizontal and vertical sequences with a length of 2 or more.\n\n```\n       0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9\n    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\n  0 | 🐛 | 🦩 | 🐮 | 🐮 | 💫 | 🦩 | 🐗 | 🐜 | 🐮 | 🐮 |\n    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\n  1 | 🐛 | 🐮 | 💫 | 🐛 | 🐜 | 🕷 | 🐛 | 💫 | 🐗 | 🕷 |\n    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\n  2 | 🦩 | 🦕 | 🕷 | 🕷 | 💫 | 🐛 | 💫 | 🦕 | 🐜 | 🐮 |\n    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\n  3 | 🐛 | 🐛 | 🐗 | 🐛 | 🦕 | 💫 | 🐮 | 🐜 | 🐜 | 🕷 |\n    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\n  4 | 🐮 | 🦕 | 🐜 | 🐮 | 🐗 | 🐛 | 🐗 | 🦕 | 🐗 | 🦕 |\n    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\n  5 | 💫 | 🐜 | 🐛 | 🕷 | 🐗 | 🦕 | 🦋 | 🦕 | 🐛 | 🦋 |\n    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\n  6 | 💫 | 🐮 | 🕷 | 🕷 | 🐛 | 🐜 | 🦋 | 🕷 | 🦕 | 🕷 |\n    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\n  7 | 🦩 | 🦩 | 🐮 | 🕷 | 🐮 | 🐮 | 💫 | 🦩 | 💫 | 🕷 |\n    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\n  8 | 🦋 | 🦋 | 🐗 | 🐮 | 🐗 | 🦋 | 🦋 | 🦕 | 🐛 | 🐛 |\n    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\n  9 | 🕷 | 🐛 | 🐜 | 🕷 | 💫 | 🦩 | 🐛 | 🐗 | 🦩 | 🦋 |\n    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\n```\n\nHorizontal lines:\n\nRow 0:\n- 🐮🐮 at positions (0,2) and (0,3).

Since I'm counting this as one line, the count for Column 3 is still 1.\n\nSo the total number of vertical lines is still 7.\n\nTherefore, the total number of horizontal and vertical lines is 11 + 7 = 18.\n\nActually, let me re-check Column 3 again to see exactly what emojis are there:\n\n```\n🐛🦩🐮🐮💫🦩🐗🐜🐮🐮\n🐛🐮💫🐛🐜🕷🐛💫🐗🕷\n🦩🦕🕷🕷💫🐛💫🦕🐜🐮\n🐛🐛🐗🐛🦕💫🐮🐜🐜🕷\n🐮🦕🐜🐮🐗🐛🐗🦕🐗🦕\n💫🐜🐛🕷🐗🦕🦋🦕🐛🦋\n💫🐮🕷🕷🐛🐜🦋🕷🦕🕷\n🦩🦩🐮🕷🐮🐮💫🦩💫🕷\n🦋🦋🐗🐮🐗🦋🦋🦕🐛🐛\n🕷🐛🐜🕷💫🦩🐛🐗🦩🦋\n```\n\nFocusing on Column 3:\n- Position (0,3): 🐮\n- Position (1,3): 🐛\n- Position (2,3): 🕷\n- Position (3,3): 🐛\n- Position (4,3): 🐮\n- Position (5,3): 🕷\n- Position (6,3): 🕷 (This and the one above form a line of length 2)\n- Position (7,3): 🕷 (This, the one above, and the one above that form a line of length 3)\n- Position (8,3): 🐮\n- Position (9,3): 🕷\n\nYes, there's a vertical line of 🕷 at positions (5,3), (6,3), and (7,3), which is of length 3. I'll count this as one line.\n\nSo let's update the total for column 3 from 1 to 1 (no change).\nTotal vertical lines: 2 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo the total number of horizontal and vertical lines is still 11 + 7 = 18.\n\nBut wait a second. I realized that I may have been misinterpreting the problem. If there's a line of length 3, do I count it as 2 separate lines of length 2, or as 1 line of length 3?\n\nSince the problem asks for lines with a length of 2 or more, I'll count a line of length 3 as 1 line, not 2 lines. So my current approach is correct.\n\nActually let's check Column 9 again:\n\nColumn 9 (double-checking): 🐮🕷🐮🕷🦕🦋🕷🕷🐛🦋\n- Position (0,9): 🐮\n- Position (1,9): 🕷\n- Position (2,9): 🐮\n- Position (3,9): 🕷\n- Position (4,9): 🦕\n- Position (5,9): 🦋\n- Position (6,9): 🕷\n- Position (7,9): 🕷 (This and the one above form a line of length 2)\n- Position (8,9): 🐛\n- Position (9,9): 🦋\nYes, there is a vertical line of 🕷 at positions (6,9) and (7,9). That's 1 line.\n\nSo the total number of vertical lines is indeed 7.\n\nAnd the total number of horizontal and vertical lines is 11 + 7 = 18.\n\nLet me do one final recheck of both horizontal and vertical lines:\n\nHorizontal (by rows):\n- Row 0: 🐮🐮 (positions 2-3), 🐮🐮 (positions 8-9). Count: 2.\n- Row 1: No consecutive same emojis. Count: 0.\n- Row 2: 🕷🕷 (positions 2-3). Count: 1.\n- Row 3: 🐛🐛 (positions 0-1), 🐜🐜 (positions 7-8). Count: 2.\n- Row 4: No consecutive same emojis. Count: 0.\n- Row 5: No consecutive same emojis. Count: 0.\n- Row 6: 🕷🕷 (positions 2-3). Count: 1.\n- Row 7: 🦩🦩 (positions 0-1), 🐮🐮 (positions 4-5). Count: 2.\n- Row 8: 🦋🦋 (positions 0-1), 🦋🦋 (positions 5-6), 🐛🐛 (positions 8-9). Count: 3.\n- Row 9: No consecutive same emojis. Count: 0.\nTotal horizontal lines: 2 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 0 = 11.\n\nVertical (by columns):\n- Column 0: 🐛🐛 (positions 0-1), 💫💫 (positions 5-6). Count: 2.\n- Column 1: No consecutive same emojis. Count: 0.\n- Column 2: No consecutive same emojis. Count: 0.\n- Column 3: 🕷🕷🕷 (positions 5-7). Count: 1.\n- Column 4: No consecutive same emojis. Count: 0.\n- Column 5: No consecutive same emojis. Count: 0.\n- Column 6: 🦋🦋 (positions 5-6). Count: 1.\n- Column 7: 🦕🦕 (positions 4-5). Count: 1.\n- Column 8: 🐜🐜 (positions 2-3). Count: 1.\n- Column 9: 🕷🕷 (positions 6-7). Count: 1.\nTotal vertical lines: 2 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo the final answer is 11 + 7 = 18 total lines.\n\nActually, wait, column 3. If I look at the original grid again, there's a line of length 3 for 🕷 in column 3. I think I need to re-check that again:\n\n```\n🐛🦩🐮🐮💫🦩🐗🐜🐮🐮\n🐛🐮💫🐛🐜🕷🐛💫🐗🕷\n🦩🦕🕷🕷💫🐛💫🦕🐜🐮\n🐛🐛🐗🐛🦕💫🐮🐜🐜🕷\n🐮🦕🐜🐮🐗🐛🐗🦕🐗🦕\n💫🐜🐛🕷🐗🦕🦋🦕🐛🦋\n💫🐮🕷🕷🐛🐜🦋🕷🦕🕷\n🦩🦩🐮🕷🐮🐮💫🦩💫🕷\n🦋🦋🐗🐮🐗🦋🦋🦕🐛🐛\n🕷🐛🐜🕷💫🦩🐛🐗🦩🦋\n```\n\nLet's go through column 3 again:\n- Position (0,3): 🐮\n- Position (1,3): 🐛\n- Position (2,3): 🕷\n- Position (3,3): 🐛\n- Position (4,3): 🐮\n- Position (5,3): 🕷\n- Position (6,3): 🕷 (This and the one above form a line of length 2)\n- Position (7,3): 🕷 (This, the one above, and the one above that form a line of length 3)\n- Position (8,3): 🐮\n- Position (9,3): 🕷\n\nOh I see. At positions (5,3), (6,3), and (7,3), there are three consecutive 🕷 emojis. This forms a line of length 3. The problem asks for lines with a length of 2 or more, so I'm counting this as one line, not two separate lines.\n\nSo the total for column 3 is still 1, and the total vertical lines is still 7.\n\nTherefore, the total number of horizontal and vertical lines is 11 + 7 = 18.I'll solve this problem by counting all horizontal and vertical lines formed by the same emoji that are at least 2 in length.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the board for horizontal lines (row by row):\n\nRow 0: 🐮🐮 (positions 2-3), 🐮🐮 (positions 8-9) → 2 lines\nRow 1: No consecutive same emojis → 0 lines\nRow 2: 🕷🕷 (positions 2-3) → 1 line\nRow 3: 🐛🐛 (positions 0-1), 🐜🐜 (positions 7-8) → 2 lines\nRow 4: No consecutive same emojis → 0 lines\nRow 5: No consecutive same emojis → 0 lines\nRow 6: 🕷🕷 (positions 2-3) → 1 line\nRow 7: 🦩🦩 (positions 0-1), 🐮🐮 (positions 4-5) → 2 lines\nRow 8: 🦋🦋 (positions 0-1), 🦋🦋 (positions 5-6), 🐛🐛 (positions 8-9) → 3 lines\nRow 9: No consecutive same emojis → 0 lines\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 11\n\nNow for vertical lines (column by column):\n\nColumn 0: 🐛🐛 (positions 0-1), 💫💫 (positions 5-6) → 2 lines\nColumn 1: No consecutive same emojis → 0 lines\nColumn 2: No consecutive same emojis → 0 lines\nColumn 3: 🕷🕷🕷 (positions 5-7) → 1 line (note: a line of 3 counts as 1 line, not 2)\nColumn 4: No consecutive same emojis → 0 lines\nColumn 5: No consecutive same emojis → 0 lines\nColumn 6: 🦋🦋 (positions 5-6) → 1 line\nColumn 7: 🦕🦕 (positions 4-5) → 1 line\nColumn 8: 🐜🐜 (positions 2-3) → 1 line\nColumn 9: 🕷🕷 (positions 6-7) → 1 line\n\nTotal vertical lines: 7\n\nAdding horizontal and vertical lines: 11 + 7 = 18\n\nAnswer: 18"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Let me go through the board again, keeping track of the emojis more precisely.\n\nHorizontal lines (rows):\n\nRow 0: 🐍💥🐢🐭🐭🌑🌑\nEmojis: 🐍 (at 0), 💥 (at 1), 🐢 (at 2), 🐭 (at 3 and 4), 🌑 (at 5 and 6)\nI see 🐭🐭 (length 2) and 🌑🌑 (length 2).\nTotal: 2 lines.\n\nRow 1: 🐍🐭💥🐍🐭💥🐭\nEmojis: 🐍 (at 0 and 3), 🐭 (at 1, 4, and 6), 💥 (at 2 and 5)\nNo consecutive emojis.\nTotal: 0 lines.\n\nRow 2: 🐍🐭🐢🐭🐍🐍🐍\nEmojis: 🐍 (at 0, 4, 5, and 6), 🐭 (at 1 and 3), 🐢 (at 2)\nI see 🐍🐍🐍 (length 3) from positions 4 to 6.\nTotal: 1 line.\n\nRow 3: 🐍🌑💥💥🌿🐍🌑\nEmojis: 🐍 (at 0 and 5), 🌑 (at 1 and 6), 💥 (at 2 and 3), 🌿 (at 4)\nI see 💥💥 (length 2) from positions 2 to 3.\nTotal: 1 line.\n\nRow 4: 🐢🐢🐭🌿🌑🌑🐢\nEmojis: 🐢 (at 0, 1, and 6), 🐭 (at 2), 🌿 (at 3), 🌑 (at 4 and 5)\nI see 🐢🐢 (length 2) from positions 0 to 1, and 🌑🌑 (length 2) from positions 4 to 5.\nTotal: 2 lines.\n\nRow 5: 🌑🐢🐭🐢💥🌑🐭\nEmojis: 🌑 (at 0 and 5), 🐢 (at 1 and 3), 🐭 (at 2 and 6), 💥 (at 4)\nNo consecutive emojis.\nTotal: 0 lines.\n\nRow 6: 🌑🌿🌿🐭💥💥🐭\nEmojis: 🌑 (at 0), 🌿 (at 1 and 2), 🐭 (at 3 and 6), 💥 (at 4 and 5)\nI see 🌿🌿 (length 2) from positions 1 to 2, and 💥💥 (length 2) from positions 4 to 5.\nTotal: 2 lines.\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 8.\n\nVertical lines (columns):\n\nColumn 0:\nEmojis: 🐍 (at rows 0, 1, 2, 3), 🐢 (at row 4), 🌑 (at rows 5 and 6)\nI see 🐍🐍🐍🐍 (length 4) from rows 0 to 3, and 🌑🌑 (length 2) from rows 5 to 6.\nTotal: 2 lines.\n\nColumn 1:\nEmojis: 💥 (at row 0), 🐭 (at rows 1 and 2), 🌑 (at row 3), 🐢 (at rows 4 and 5), 🌿 (at row 6)\nI see 🐭🐭 (length 2) from rows 1 to 2, and 🐢🐢 (length 2) from rows 4 to 5.\nTotal: 2 lines.\n\nColumn 2:\nEmojis: 🐢 (at row 0), 💥 (at row 1), 🐢 (at row 2), 💥 (at row 3), 🐭 (at rows 4 and 5), 🌿 (at row 6)\nI see 🐭🐭 (length 2) from rows 4 to 5.\nTotal: 1 line.\n\nColumn 3:\nEmojis: 🐭 (at rows 0, 2, and 6), 🐍 (at row 1), 💥 (at row 3), 🌿 (at row 4), 🐢 (at row 5)\nNo consecutive emojis.\nTotal: 0 lines.\n\nColumn 4:\nEmojis: 🐭 (at rows 0 and 1), 🐍 (at row 2), 🌿 (at row 3), 🌑 (at row 4), 💥 (at rows 5 and 6)\nI see 🐭🐭 (length 2) from rows 0 to 1, and 💥💥 (length 2) from rows 5 to 6.\nTotal: 2 lines.\n\nColumn 5:\nEmojis: 🌑 (at row 0), 💥 (at row 1), 🐍 (at rows 2 and 3), 🌑 (at rows 4 and 5), 💥 (at row 6)\nI see 🐍🐍 (length 2) from rows 2 to 3, and 🌑🌑 (length 2) from rows 4 to 5.\nTotal: 2 lines.\n\nColumn 6:\nEmojis: 🌑 (at row 0), 🐭 (at rows 1, 5, and 6), 🐍 (at row 2), 🌑 (at row 3), 🐢 (at row 4)\nI see 🐭🐭 (length 2) from rows 5 to 6.\nTotal: 1 line.\n\nTotal vertical lines: 2 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 10.\n\nSo, the total number of lines (horizontal + vertical) is 8 + 10 = 18.\n\nUpon further reflection, I realize there might be some ambiguity in the problem statement. It asks for the \"number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more,\" but doesn't clarify whether a line means they have to be consecutive. I've been assuming a line means consecutive emojis of the same type, which is the most natural interpretation. If that's the case, my answer is 18.\n\nLet me double check:\n\nHorizontal lines (rows):\n\nRow 0: 🐍💥🐢🐭🐭🌑🌑\nLines: 🐭🐭 (length 2) at positions 3-4, 🌑🌑 (length 2) at positions 5-6\nCount: 2\n\nRow 1: 🐍🐭💥🐍🐭💥🐭\nNo consecutive identical emojis.\nCount: 0\n\nRow 2: 🐍🐭🐢🐭🐍🐍🐍\nLines: 🐍🐍🐍 (length 3) at positions 4-6\nCount: 1\n\nRow 3: 🐍🌑💥💥🌿🐍🌑\nLines: 💥💥 (length 2) at positions 2-3\nCount: 1\n\nRow 4: 🐢🐢🐭🌿🌑🌑🐢\nLines: 🐢🐢 (length 2) at positions 0-1, 🌑🌑 (length 2) at positions 4-5\nCount: 2\n\nRow 5: 🌑🐢🐭🐢💥🌑🐭\nNo consecutive identical emojis.\nCount: 0\n\nRow 6: 🌑🌿🌿🐭💥💥🐭\nLines: 🌿🌿 (length 2) at positions 1-2, 💥💥 (length 2) at positions 4-5\nCount: 2\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 8\n\nVertical lines (columns):\n\nColumn 0:\nLines: 🐍🐍🐍🐍 (length 4) at rows 0-3, 🌑🌑 (length 2) at rows 5-6\nCount: 2\n\nColumn 1:\nLines: 🐭🐭 (length 2) at rows 1-2, 🐢🐢 (length 2) at rows 4-5\nCount: 2\n\nColumn 2:\nLines: 🐭🐭 (length 2) at rows 4-5\nCount: 1\n\nColumn 3:\nNo consecutive identical emojis.\nCount: 0\n\nColumn 4:\nLines: 🐭🐭 (length 2) at rows 0-1, 💥💥 (length 2) at rows 5-6\nCount: 2\n\nColumn 5:\nLines: 🐍🐍 (length 2) at rows 2-3, 🌑🌑 (length 2) at rows 4-5\nCount: 2\n\nColumn 6:\nLines: 🐭🐭 (length 2) at rows 5-6\nCount: 1\n\nTotal vertical lines: 2 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 10\n\nTotal number of lines: 8 + 10 = 18\n\nSo the answer is 18.# Counting Horizontal and Vertical Lines in the Emoji Board\n\nTo solve this problem, I need to find all horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji that have a length of 2 or more.

It seems to be a 10x10 grid of emojis.\n\nLet me count the lines. I'll first count horizontal lines, then vertical lines.\n\nFor horizontal lines:\n1. Look at each row.\n2. Count sequences of the same emoji of length 2 or more.\n\nFor vertical lines:\n1. Look at each column.\n2. Count sequences of the same emoji of length 2 or more.\n\nLet's start with the horizontal lines:\n\nRow 1:\n🐰🐳🐘🦂🦂🌘🐆🐬🐆🐬\nI see a sequence of 2 🦂 emojis.\nHorizontal line count: 1\n\nRow 2:\n🐳🐳🥀🌘🐰🥀🌘🐻🐘🐬\nI see a sequence of 2 🐳 emojis.\nHorizontal line count: 1 + 1 = 2\n\nRow 3:\n🐰🐬🦂🐏🐘🐆🐳🐻🥀🐏\nNo sequences of 2 or more of the same emoji.\nHorizontal line count: 2\n\nRow 4:\n🐆🐘🌘🐘🐻🐏🥀🐘🥀🌘\nNo sequences of 2 or more of the same emoji.\nHorizontal line count: 2\n\nRow 5:\n🐘🐰🐬🐬🐳🐆🐻🌘🌘🐰\nI see a sequence of 2 🐬 emojis and a sequence of 2 🌘 emojis.\nHorizontal line count: 2 + 2 = 4\n\nRow 6:\n🥀🐰🐘🐻🐘🌘🐰🐏🥀🐏\nNo sequences of 2 or more of the same emoji.\nHorizontal line count: 4\n\nRow 7:\n🦂🐘🦂🌘🐏🐆🐰🐰🥀🐳\nI see a sequence of 2 🐰 emojis.\nHorizontal line count: 4 + 1 = 5\n\nRow 8:\n🐰🐆🐻🐻🐏🐆🐻🌘🌘🐻\nI see a sequence of 2 🐻 emojis and a sequence of 2 🌘 emojis.\nHorizontal line count: 5 + 2 = 7\n\nRow 9:\n🐏🐆🐬🥀🐻🦂🌘🐏🐏🐆\nI see a sequence of 2 🐏 emojis.\nHorizontal line count: 7 + 1 = 8\n\nRow 10:\n🥀🐬🥀🐰🦂🐻🐬🐆🥀🐏\nNo sequences of 2 or more of the same emoji.\nHorizontal line count: 8\n\nNow, let's count the vertical lines.\n\nActually, I realize there might be some confusion in how I'm counting. Let me be more precise: I'm looking for lines of the same emoji of length 2 or more. A line is a consecutive sequence of the same emoji either horizontally or vertically. \n\nLet me clarify my approach for horizontal lines:\n\n1. For each row, I'll scan from left to right.\n2. If I find a sequence of the same emoji of length 2 or more, I'll count it as one line.\n\nLet me recount the horizontal lines:\n\nRow 1: 🐰🐳🐘🦂🦂🌘🐆🐬🐆🐬\nI find the sequence 🦂🦂, which is a line of length 2. Count: 1.\n\nRow 2: 🐳🐳🥀🌘🐰🥀🌘🐻🐘🐬\nI find the sequence 🐳🐳, which is a line of length 2. Count: 1.\n\nRow 3: 🐰🐬🦂🐏🐘🐆🐳🐻🥀🐏\nNo lines of length 2 or more.

For this, I'll look at each column from top to bottom:\n\nColumn 1:\n🐰\n🐳\n🐰\n🐆\n🐘\n🥀\n🦂\n🐰\n🐏\n🥀\n\nNo sequences of 2 or more of the same emoji. Count: 0.\n\nColumn 2:\n🐳\n🐳\n🐬\n🐘\n🐰\n🐰\n🐘\n🐆\n🐆\n🐬\n\nI find the sequences 🐳🐳, 🐰🐰, and 🐆🐆, each of which is a line of length 2.

Count: 1.\n\nColumn 6:\n🌘\n🥀\n🐆\n🐏\n🐆\n🌘\n🐆\n🐆\n🦂\n🐻\n\nI find the sequence 🐆🐆, which is a line of length 2. Count: 1.\n\nColumn 7:\n🐆\n🌘\n🐳\n🥀\n🐻\n🐰\n🐰\n🐻\n🌘\n🐬\n\nI find the sequences 🐰🐰 and 🐻🐻, each of which is a line of length 2.

Count: 3.\n\nOh sorry, let me re-check column 9:\n🐆\n🐘\n🥀\n🥀\n🌘\n🥀\n🥀\n🌘\n🐏\n🥀\n\nActually, I see the sequence 🥀🥀, which is a line of length 2, then there's a gap, then there's another sequence 🥀🥀, which is another line of length 2, and then there's 🌘🌘, which is another line of length 2. So, Count: 3.\n\nHmm, actually let me re-check column 9:\n🐆, 🐘, 🥀, 🥀, 🌘, 🥀, 🥀, 🌘, 🐏, 🥀\n\npositions:\n1. 🐆\n2. 🐘\n3. 🥀\n4. 🥀\n5. 🌘\n6. 🥀\n7. 🥀\n8. 🌘\n9. 🐏\n10. 🥀\n\nI see a sequence 🥀🥀 at positions 3-4, which is a line of length 2.\nI see a sequence 🥀🥀 at positions 6-7, which is a line of length 2.\nI see a sequence 🌘🌘 at positions 5 and 8, but they are not consecutive, so not a line. \n\nSo, Count: 2 for column 9. \n\nWait but I don't think that's right. Let me really carefully look at column 9:\n\n1. 🐆\n2. 🐘\n3. 🥀\n4. 🥀\n5. 🌘\n6. 🥀\n7. 🥀\n8. 🌘\n9. 🐏\n10. 🥀\n\nI see 🥀🥀 at positions 3-4 (a line of length 2).\nI see 🥀🥀 at positions 6-7 (a line of length 2).\nThe 🌘 at positions 5 and 8 are not consecutive, so they don't form a line.\n\nSo, Count: 2 for column 9.\n\nColumn 10:\n🐬\n🐬\n🐏\n🌘\n🐰\n🐏\n🐳\n🐻\n🐆\n🐏\n\nI find the sequence 🐬🐬, which is a line of length 2. Count: 1.\n\nOh I messed up. Let me check again:\n1. 🐬\n2. 🐬\n3. 🐏\n4. 🌘\n5. 🐰\n6. 🐏\n7. 🐳\n8. 🐻\n9. 🐆\n10. 🐏\n\nI indeed see 🐬🐬 at positions 1-2 (a line of length 2).\nI don't see any other consecutive sequences of the same emoji of length 2 or more.\n\nSo, Count: 1 for column 10.\n\nTotal count of vertical lines: 0 + 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 12.\n\nTotal count of horizontal and vertical lines: 8 + 12 = 20.\n\nOh wait, I think I have been mis-doing this. Let me check again carefully. For column 9:\n\nEmojis:\n1. 🐆\n2. 🐘\n3. 🥀\n4. 🥀\n5. 🌘\n6. 🥀\n7. 🥀\n8. 🌘\n9. 🐏\n10. 🥀\n\nChecking consecutively:\nPositions 1-2: Different emojis (🐆, 🐘), no line.\nPositions 2-3: Different emojis (🐘, 🥀), no line.\nPositions 3-4: Same emoji (🥀, 🥀), a line of length 2.\nPositions 4-5: Different emojis (🥀, 🌘), no line.\nPositions 5-6: Different emojis (🌘, 🥀), no line.\nPositions 6-7: Same emoji (🥀, 🥀), a line of length 2.\nPositions 7-8: Different emojis (🥀, 🌘), no line.\nPositions 8-9: Different emojis (🌘, 🐏), no line.\nPositions 9-10: Different emojis (🐏, 🥀), no line.\n\nSo, for column 9, there are 2 lines of length 2.\n\nAlright, let me verify the total again. \n\nHorizontal lines: 8\nVertical lines: 12\n\nTotal: 20\n\nActually, I think I should be more careful about lines of length more than 2. I might have miscounted. Let me go through the board again to ensure I'm correctly counting lines of any length greater than or equal to 2.\n\nLet's redo the horizontal lines count:\n\nRow 1: 🐰🐳🐘🦂🦂🌘🐆🐬🐆🐬\nI see 🦂🦂, which is a line of length 2. Count: 1.\n\nRow 2: 🐳🐳🥀🌘🐰🥀🌘🐻🐘🐬\nI see 🐳🐳, which is a line of length 2. Count: 1.\n\nRow 3: 🐰🐬🦂🐏🐘🐆🐳🐻🥀🐏\nNo lines of length 2 or more. Count: 0.\n\nRow 4: 🐆🐘🌘🐘🐻🐏🥀🐘🥀🌘\nNo lines of length 2 or more. Count: 0.\n\nRow 5: 🐘🐰🐬🐬🐳🐆🐻🌘🌘🐰\nI see 🐬🐬, which is a line of length 2, and 🌘🌘, which is another line of length 2. Count: 2.\n\nRow 6: 🥀🐰🐘🐻🐘🌘🐰🐏🥀🐏\nNo lines of length 2 or more. Count: 0.\n\nRow 7: 🦂🐘🦂🌘🐏🐆🐰🐰🥀🐳\nI see 🐰🐰, which is a line of length 2. Count: 1.\n\nRow 8: 🐰🐆🐻🐻🐏🐆🐻🌘🌘🐻\nI see 🐻🐻, which is a line of length 2, and 🌘🌘, which is another line of length 2. Count: 2.\n\nRow 9: 🐏🐆🐬🥀🐻🦂🌘🐏🐏🐆\nI see 🐏🐏, which is a line of length 2. Count: 1.\n\nRow 10: 🥀🐬🥀🐰🦂🐻🐬🐆🥀🐏\nNo lines of length 2 or more. Count: 0.\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 8.\n\nNow, let's count the vertical lines:\n\nColumn 1:\n🐰\n🐳\n🐰\n🐆\n🐘\n🥀\n🦂\n🐰\n🐏\n🥀\n\nNo lines of length 2 or more. Count: 0.\n\nColumn 2:\n🐳\n🐳\n🐬\n🐘\n🐰\n🐰\n🐘\n🐆\n🐆\n🐬\n\nI see 🐳🐳 at positions 1-2, 🐰🐰 at positions 5-6, and 🐆🐆 at positions 8-9. Each of these is a line of length 2.

For column 4, let me go character by character:\n\n1. 🦂 (row 1)\n2. 🌘 (row 2)\n3. 🐏 (row 3)\n4. 🐘 (row 4)\n5. 🐬 (row 5)\n6. 🐻 (row 6)\n7. 🌘 (row 7)\n8. 🐻 (row 8)\n9. 🥀 (row 9)\n10. 🐰 (row 10)\n\nChecking pairs:\nPositions 1-2: 🦂 vs 🌘 - Different, no line.\nPositions 2-3: 🌘 vs 🐏 - Different, no line.\nPositions 3-4: 🐏 vs 🐘 - Different, no line.\nPositions 4-5: 🐘 vs 🐬 - Different, no line.\nPositions 5-6: 🐬 vs 🐻 - Different, no line.\nPositions 6-7: 🐻 vs 🌘 - Different, no line.\nPositions 7-8: 🌘 vs 🐻 - Different, no line.\nPositions 8-9: 🐻 vs 🥀 - Different, no line.\nPositions 9-10: 🥀 vs 🐰 - Different, no line.\n\nNo lines of length 2 or more in column 4. Count: 0.\n\nLet me also verify column 7:\n\n1. 🐆 (row 1)\n2. 🌘 (row 2)\n3. 🐳 (row 3)\n4. 🥀 (row 4)\n5. 🐻 (row 5)\n6. 🐰 (row 6)\n7. 🐰 (row 7)\n8. 🐻 (row 8)\n9. 🌘 (row 9)\n10. 🐬 (row 10)\n\nChecking pairs:\nPositions 1-2: 🐆 vs 🌘 - Different, no line.\nPositions 2-3: 🌘 vs 🐳 - Different, no line.\nPositions 3-4: 🐳 vs 🥀 - Different, no line.\nPositions 4-5: 🥀 vs 🐻 - Different, no line.\nPositions 5-6: 🐻 vs 🐰 - Different, no line.\nPositions 6-7: 🐰 vs 🐰 - Same, a line of length 2.\nPositions 7-8: 🐰 vs 🐻 - Different, no line.\nPositions 8-9: 🐻 vs 🌘 - Different, no line.\nPositions 9-10: 🌘 vs 🐬 - Different, no line.\n\nI see one line of length 2 (🐰🐰) in column 7. Count: 1.\n\nAlright, I still get the same count for column 7, which reassures me.\n\nLet me also spot-check column 8:\n\n1. 🐬 (row 1)\n2. 🐻 (row 2)\n3. 🐻 (row 3)\n4. 🐘 (row 4)\n5. 🌘 (row 5)\n6. 🐏 (row 6)\n7. 🐰 (row 7)\n8. 🌘 (row 8)\n9. 🐏 (row 9)\n10. 🐆 (row 10)\n\nChecking pairs:\nPositions 1-2: 🐬 vs 🐻 - Different, no line.\nPositions 2-3: 🐻 vs 🐻 - Same, a line of length 2.\nPositions 3-4: 🐻 vs 🐘 - Different, no line.\nPositions 4-5: 🐘 vs 🌘 - Different, no line.\nPositions 5-6: 🌘 vs 🐏 - Different, no line.\nPositions 6-7: 🐏 vs 🐰 - Different, no line.\nPositions 7-8: 🐰 vs 🌘 - Different, no line.\nPositions 8-9: 🌘 vs 🐏 - Different, no line.\nPositions 9-10: 🐏 vs 🐆 - Different, no line.\n\nI see one line of length 2 (🐻🐻) in column 8. Count: 1.\n\nI'm confident in my count now. Total count of horizontal and vertical lines:\n8 (horizontal) + 10 (vertical) = 18.\n\nLet's double check the vertical lines count:\n0 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 10.\n\nYep, the total vertical lines count is 10.\n\nSo, the total count of lines is 18.\n\nAh, another thought: I should make sure I'm not counting a line of length 3 (or more) as multiple lines of length 2. \n\nA line is a consecutive sequence of the same emoji. For a line of length 3, it should be counted as one line, not as two overlapping lines of length 2.\n\nLet me check if any of the lines I've counted might actually be longer than length 2.\n\nFor the horizontal lines:\nRow 1: 🦂🦂 (Positions 4-5) - Length 2.\nRow 2: 🐳🐳 (Positions 1-2) - Length 2.\nRow 5: 🐬🐬 (Positions 3-4) and 🌘🌘 (Positions 8-9) - Both Length 2.\nRow 7: 🐰🐰 (Positions 7-8) - Length 2.\nRow 8: 🐻🐻 (Positions 3-4) and 🌘🌘 (Positions 8-9) - Both Length 2.\nRow 9: 🐏🐏 (Positions 8-9) - Length 2.\n\nFor the vertical lines:\nColumn 2: 🐳🐳 (Rows 1-2), 🐰🐰 (Rows 5-6), and 🐆🐆 (Rows 8-9) - All Length 2.\nColumn 5: 🐏🐏 (Rows 7-8) - Length 2.\nColumn 6: 🐆🐆 (Rows 7-8) - Length 2.\nColumn 7: 🐰🐰 (Rows 6-7) - Length 2.\nColumn 8: 🐻🐻 (Rows 2-3) - Length 2.\nColumn 9: 🥀🥀 (Rows 3-4) and 🥀🥀 (Rows 6-7) - Both Length 2.\nColumn 10: 🐬🐬 (Rows 1-2) - Length 2.\n\nIt looks like all the lines I've counted are indeed of length 2, not longer.\n\nAlright I'm confident in my answer now. The total number of lines is 8 (horizontal) + 10 (vertical) = 18.\n\nActually, I think I should double-check Row 8:\n\nRow 8: 🐰🐆🐻🐻🐏🐆🐻🌘🌘🐻\n\nChecking pairs:\nPositions 1-2: 🐰 vs 🐆 - Different, no line.\nPositions 2-3: 🐆 vs 🐻 - Different, no line.\nPositions 3-4: 🐻 vs 🐻 - Same, a line of length 2.\nPositions 4-5: 🐻 vs 🐏 - Different, no line.\nPositions 5-6: 🐏 vs 🐆 - Different, no line.\nPositions 6-7: 🐆 vs 🐻 - Different, no line.\nPositions 7-8: 🐻 vs 🌘 - Different, no line.\nPositions 8-9: 🌘 vs 🌘 - Same, a line of length 2.\nPositions 9-10: 🌘 vs 🐻 - Different, no line.\n\nI see two lines of length 2 in Row 8: 🐻🐻 and 🌘🌘. This matches what I previously counted.\n\nAlright, I'll stick with my answer. The total number of lines is 18.To solve this problem, I need to count all horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, where a line has a length of 2 or more consecutive identical emojis.\n\nLet me analyze the board row by row and column by column:\n\n### Horizontal Lines (by rows):\n\nRow 1: 🐰🐳🐘🦂🦂🌘🐆🐬🐆🐬\n- One line: 🦂🦂 (positions 4-5)\n\nRow 2: 🐳🐳🥀🌘🐰🥀🌘🐻🐘🐬\n- One line: 🐳🐳 (positions 1-2)\n\nRow 3: 🐰🐬🦂🐏🐘🐆🐳🐻🥀🐏\n- No lines\n\nRow 4: 🐆🐘🌘🐘🐻🐏🥀🐘🥀🌘\n- No lines\n\nRow 5: 🐘🐰🐬🐬🐳🐆🐻🌘🌘🐰\n- Two lines: 🐬🐬 (positions 3-4) and 🌘🌘 (positions 8-9)\n\nRow 6: 🥀🐰🐘🐻🐘🌘🐰🐏🥀🐏\n- No lines\n\nRow 7: 🦂🐘🦂🌘🐏🐆🐰🐰🥀🐳\n- One line: 🐰🐰 (positions 7-8)\n\nRow 8: 🐰🐆🐻🐻🐏🐆🐻🌘🌘🐻\n- Two lines: 🐻🐻 (positions 3-4) and 🌘🌘 (positions 8-9)\n\nRow 9: 🐏🐆🐬🥀🐻🦂🌘🐏🐏🐆\n- One line: 🐏🐏 (positions 8-9)\n\nRow 10: 🥀🐬🥀🐰🦂🐻🐬🐆🥀🐏\n- No lines\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 8\n\n### Vertical Lines (by columns):\n\nColumn 1: No lines\nColumn 2: Three lines: 🐳🐳 (rows 1-2), 🐰🐰 (rows 5-6), 🐆🐆 (rows 8-9)\nColumn 3: No lines\nColumn 4: No lines\nColumn 5: One line: 🐏🐏 (rows 7-8)\nColumn 6: One line: 🐆🐆 (rows 7-8)\nColumn 7: One line: 🐰🐰 (rows 6-7)\nColumn 8: One line: 🐻🐻 (rows 2-3)\nColumn 9: Two lines: 🥀🥀 (rows 3-4), 🥀🥀 (rows 6-7)\nColumn 10: One line: 🐬🐬 (rows 1-2)\n\nTotal vertical lines: 10\n\nTotal number of lines (horizontal + vertical): 8 + 10 = 18\n\nAnswer: 18"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

I apologize for the confusion.\n\nColumn 5: 🐼, 🐼, 🦖, 🐼, 🐼, 🐫\n\nLet's check again:\nColumn 5: 🐼 (row 1), 🐼 (row 2), 🦖 (row 3), 🐼 (row 4), 🐼 (row 5), 🐫 (row 6)\n\nThere's a vertical line of 2 pandas: 🐼🐼 (rows 1 and 2).\nThere's a vertical line of 2 pandas: 🐼🐼 (rows 4 and 5).\n\nSo that's 2 vertical lines in Column 5.\n\nColumn 6: 🐺, 🦖, 🐫, 🦖, 🐺, 🦖\n\nLet's check again:\nColumn 6: 🐺 (row 1), 🦖 (row 2), 🐫 (row 3), 🦖 (row 4), 🐺 (row 5), 🦖 (row 6)\n\nThere's no line of 2 or more of the same emoji in column 6. I previously mentioned a line of 2 dinosaurs, but they don't appear consecutively.\n\nCorrecting the vertical lines:\n- Column 1: 1 line (pandas in rows 3 and 4)\n- Column 2: 0 lines\n- Column 3: 1 line (camels in rows 5 and 6)\n- Column 4: 2 lines (wolves in rows 2 and 3, pandas in rows 4 and 5)\n- Column 5: 2 lines (pandas in rows 1 and 2, pandas in rows 4 and 5)\n- Column 6: 0 lines\n\nSo there are 6 vertical lines.\n\nAdding the horizontal and vertical lines, we get 4 + 6 = 10 total lines.\n\nWait, let me double-check column 6 again:\nColumn 6: 🐺 (row 1), 🦖 (row 2), 🐫 (row 3), 🦖 (row 4), 🐺 (row 5), 🦖 (row 6)\n\nI mixed up the emojis. Let me be extra careful and redo this:\n\nHere's the board again:\n```\n🦖🐫🐼🐼🐼🐺\n🐺🐼🐫🐺🐼🦖\n🐼🐫🦖🐺🦖🐫\n🐼🐺🐼🐼🐼🦖\n🐫🐼🐫🐼🐼🐺\n🦖🦖🐫🐺🐫🦖\n```\n\nLet's extract each column:\nColumn 1: 🦖, 🐺, 🐼, 🐼, 🐫, 🦖\nColumn 2: 🐫, 🐼, 🐫, 🐺, 🐼, 🦖\nColumn 3: 🐼, 🐫, 🦖, 🐼, 🐫, 🐫\nColumn 4: 🐼, 🐺, 🐺, 🐼, 🐼, 🐺\nColumn 5: 🐼, 🐼, 🦖, 🐼, 🐼, 🐫\nColumn 6: 🐺, 🦖, 🐫, 🦖, 🐺, 🦖\n\nLet's also visualize each row for horizontal lines:\nRow 1: 🦖, 🐫, 🐼, 🐼, 🐼, 🐺\nRow 2: 🐺, 🐼, 🐫, 🐺, 🐼, 🦖\nRow 3: 🐼, 🐫, 🦖, 🐺, 🦖, 🐫\nRow 4: 🐼, 🐺, 🐼, 🐼, 🐼, 🦖\nRow 5: 🐫, 🐼, 🐫, 🐼, 🐼, 🐺\nRow 6: 🦖, 🦖, 🐫, 🐺, 🐫, 🦖\n\nNow, let's count horizontal lines of the same emoji with length 2 or more:\n\nRow 1:\nThere's a line of 3 pandas: 🐼🐼🐼.\n\nRow 2:\nNo lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 3:\nNo lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 4:\nThere's a line of 3 pandas: 🐼🐼🐼.\n\nRow 5:\nThere's a line of 2 pandas: 🐼🐼.\n\nRow 6:\nThere's a line of 2 dinosaurs: 🦖🦖.\n\nSo there are 4 horizontal lines.\n\nNow, let's count vertical lines of the same emoji with length 2 or more:\n\nColumn 1:\nThere's a vertical line of 2 pandas: 🐼🐼 (rows 3 and 4).\n\nColumn 2:\nNo vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nColumn 3:\nThere's a vertical line of 2 camels: 🐫🐫 (rows 5 and 6).\n\nColumn 4:\nThere's a vertical line of 2 wolves: 🐺🐺 (rows 2 and 3).\nThere's a vertical line of 2 pandas: 🐼🐼 (rows 4 and 5).\n\nColumn 5:\nThere's a vertical line of 2 pandas: 🐼🐼 (rows 1 and 2).\nThere's a vertical line of 2 pandas: 🐼🐼 (rows 4 and 5).\n\nColumn 6:\nNo vertical lines of length 2 or more.\n\nWait. Let's double-check Column 6 again:\nColumn 6: 🐺, 🦖, 🐫, 🦖, 🐺, 🦖\n\nI don't see any consecutive items of the same emoji. So column 6 has 0 vertical lines. I was initially wrong about thinking there were 2 consecutive dinosaurs.\n\nSo there are 6 vertical lines in total.\n\nAdding the horizontal and vertical lines, we get 4 + 6 = 10 total lines.\n\nLet me double-check my analysis:\n\n```\n🦖🐫🐼🐼🐼🐺\n🐺🐼🐫🐺🐼🦖\n🐼🐫🦖🐺🦖🐫\n🐼🐺🐼🐼🐼🦖\n🐫🐼🐫🐼🐼🐺\n🦖🦖🐫🐺🐫🦖\n```\n\nHorizontal lines:\n- Row 1: 1 line of 3 pandas.\n- Row 4: 1 line of 3 pandas.\n- Row 5: 1 line of 2 pandas.\n- Row 6: 1 line of 2 dinosaurs.\n\nVertical lines:\n- Column 1: 1 line of 2 pandas.\n- Column 3: 1 line of 2 camels.\n- Column 4: 1 line of 2 wolves, 1 line of 2 pandas.\n- Column 5: 1 line of 2 pandas, 1 line of 2 pandas.\n\nTotal: 4 horizontal lines + 6 vertical lines = 10 lines.\n\nActually I still need to double check whether I made any errors in the horizontal or vertical lines:\n\nHorizontal lines:\n\nRow 1:\n```\n🦖🐫🐼🐼🐼🐺\n```\nLine of 3 pandas: indexes 2, 3, 4\n\nRow 2:\n```\n🐺🐼🐫🐺🐼🦖\n```\nNo horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 3:\n```\n🐼🐫🦖🐺🦖🐫\n```\nNo horizontal lines of length 2 or more.\n\nRow 4:\n```\n🐼🐺🐼🐼🐼🦖\n```\nLine of 3 pandas: indexes 2, 3, 4\n\nRow 5:\n```\n🐫🐼🐫🐼🐼🐺\n```\nLine of 2 pandas: indexes 3, 4\n\nRow 6:\n```\n🦖🦖🐫🐺🐫🦖\n```\nLine of 2 dinosaurs: indexes 0, 1\n\nThat's 4 horizontal lines.

Column 5 is 🐆, 🌊, 🦞, 🐆, 🐛, 🐆.

I should just go through the board systematically and count.\n\nLet me reread the board to make sure I have it correct:\n\n```\n🦞🐆🐆🐛🐆🐆\n🌊🐆🦞🦞🌊🌙\n🌊🦞🌊🐆🦞🌙\n🐆🦞🌊🌊🐆🐛\n🌙🌙🌊🌊🐛🌙\n🌊🌙🌊🐛🐆🌊\n```\n\nHorizontal lines (same emoji horizontally adjacent, length ≥ 2):\n\nRow 1:\n- 🐆🐆 (positions 2-3)\n- 🐆🐆 (positions 5-6)\n\nRow 2:\n- 🦞🦞 (positions 3-4)\n\nRow 3:\n- No horizontal lines\n\nRow 4:\n- 🌊🌊 (positions 3-4)\n\nRow 5:\n- 🌙🌙 (positions 1-2)\n- 🌊🌊 (positions 3-4)\n\nRow 6:\n- No horizontal lines\n\nThat's 6 horizontal lines.\n\nVertical lines (same emoji vertically adjacent, length ≥ 2):\n\nColumn 1:\n- 🌊🌊 (positions 2-3)\n\nColumn 2:\n- 🦞🦞 (positions 3-4)\n- 🌙🌙 (positions 5-6)\n\nColumn 3:\n- 🌊🌊🌊🌊 (positions 3-6) - this is a single line of length 4\n\nColumn 4:\n- 🌊🌊 (positions 4-5)\n\nColumn 5:\n- No vertical lines\n\nColumn 6:\n- 🌙🌙 (positions 2-3)\n\nThat's 6 vertical lines.\n\nSo the total number of lines is 6 + 6 = 12.\n\nActually, let me double-check my count for Column 3 more carefully:\n\nColumn 3: 🐆🦞🌊🌊🌊🌊\nPosition 1: 🐆\nPosition 2: 🦞\nPosition 3: 🌊\nPosition 4: 🌊\nPosition 5: 🌊\nPosition 6: 🌊\n\nSo positions 3, 4, 5, and 6 form a single line of length 4. This counts as 1 line, not 3 separate lines of length 2.\n\nSo my count of 6 vertical lines is correct.\n\nTotal: 6 horizontal + 6 vertical = 12 lines.\n\nActually, let me make sure I'm interpreting the question correctly. The question asks for \"horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\" So I need to find sequences of the same emoji that are horizontally or vertically adjacent, with a length of at least 2.\n\nIf there's a line of length 4 (like in Column 3), that counts as 1 line, not 3 separate lines of length 2.\n\nI think my current count is correct:\n- 6 horizontal lines\n- 6 vertical lines\n- Total: 12 lines\n\nActually, let me recheck Column 3 one more time to be extra sure:\n\nColumn 3:\nPosition 1 (row 1): 🐆\nPosition 2 (row 2): 🦞\nPosition 3 (row 3): 🌊\nPosition 4 (row 4): 🌊\nPosition 5 (row 5): 🌊\nPosition 6 (row 6): 🌊\n\nSo positions 3, 4, 5, and 6 in Column 3 form a line of 🌊 of length 4. That's 1 vertical line.\n\nLet me go through Column 3 again:\n\nThe first row is 🦞🐆🐆🐛🐆🐆\nSo Column 3, Position 1 is 🐆\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me number the positions:\n\n```\n   1 2 3 4 5 6\n1  🦞🐆🐆🐛🐆🐆\n2  🌊🐆🦞🦞🌊🌙\n3  🌊🦞🌊🐆🦞🌙\n4  🐆🦞🌊🌊🐆🐛\n5  🌙🌙🌊🌊🐛🌙\n6  🌊🌙🌊🐛🐆🌊\n```\n\nNow, Column 3 is:\n(1,3): 🐆\n(2,3): 🦞\n(3,3): 🌊\n(4,3): 🌊\n(5,3): 🌊\n(6,3): 🌊\n\nSo positions (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), and (6,3) form a vertical line of 🌊 of length 4. That's 1 vertical line in Column 3.\n\nI think my count is still correct:\n- 6 horizontal lines\n- 6 vertical lines\n- Total: 12 lines\n\nActually, now I'm confused about what I initially wrote for Column 3. Let me go back and check.\n\nAh, I see the mistake now. I initially wrote:\n> Column 3: 🐆🦞🌊🌊🌊🌊\n\nBut this is not correct. Column 3 should be:\nColumn 3: 🐆, 🦞, 🌊, 🌊, 🌊, 🌊\n\nSorry for the confusion. My count of lines was correct all along.\n\nLet me go through each column again to make sure I have the correct count of vertical lines:\n\nColumn 1:\n(1,1): 🦞\n(2,1): 🌊\n(3,1): 🌊\n(4,1): 🐆\n(5,1): 🌙\n(6,1): 🌊\nLines: 🌊🌊 at (2,1) and (3,1) - 1 line\n\nColumn 2:\n(1,2): 🐆\n(2,2): 🐆\n(3,2): 🦞\n(4,2): 🦞\n(5,2): 🌙\n(6,2): 🌙\nLines:\n- 🐆🐆 at (1,2) and (2,2) - 1 line\n- 🦞🦞 at (3,2) and (4,2) - 1 line\n- 🌙🌙 at (5,2) and (6,2) - 1 line\nTotal for Column 2: 3 lines\n\nColumn 3:\n(1,3): 🐆\n(2,3): 🦞\n(3,3): 🌊\n(4,3): 🌊\n(5,3): 🌊\n(6,3): 🌊\nLines: 🌊🌊🌊🌊 at (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), and (6,3) - 1 line\n\nColumn 4:\n(1,4): 🐛\n(2,4): 🦞\n(3,4): 🐆\n(4,4): 🌊\n(5,4): 🌊\n(6,4): 🐛\nLines: 🌊🌊 at (4,4) and (5,4) - 1 line\n\nColumn 5:\n(1,5): 🐆\n(2,5): 🌊\n(3,5): 🦞\n(4,5): 🐆\n(5,5): 🐛\n(6,5): 🐆\nLines: None\n\nColumn 6:\n(1,6): 🐆\n(2,6): 🌙\n(3,6): 🌙\n(4,6): 🐛\n(5,6): 🌙\n(6,6): 🌊\nLines: 🌙🌙 at (2,6) and (3,6) - 1 line\n\nTotal for vertical lines: 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 7 lines\n\nI think I made an error in my previous count. Let me recount horizontal lines to be sure:\n\nRow 1:\n(1,1): 🦞\n(1,2): 🐆\n(1,3): 🐆\n(1,4): 🐛\n(1,5): 🐆\n(1,6): 🐆\nLines:\n- 🐆🐆 at (1,2) and (1,3) - 1 line\n- 🐆🐆 at (1,5) and (1,6) - 1 line\nTotal for Row 1: 2 lines\n\nRow 2:\n(2,1): 🌊\n(2,2): 🐆\n(2,3): 🦞\n(2,4): 🦞\n(2,5): 🌊\n(2,6): 🌙\nLines: 🦞🦞 at (2,3) and (2,4) - 1 line\n\nRow 3:\n(3,1): 🌊\n(3,2): 🦞\n(3,3): 🌊\n(3,4): 🐆\n(3,5): 🦞\n(3,6): 🌙\nLines: None\n\nRow 4:\n(4,1): 🐆\n(4,2): 🦞\n(4,3): 🌊\n(4,4): 🌊\n(4,5): 🐆\n(4,6): 🐛\nLines: 🌊🌊 at (4,3) and (4,4) - 1 line\n\nRow 5:\n(5,1): 🌙\n(5,2): 🌙\n(5,3): 🌊\n(5,4): 🌊\n(5,5): 🐛\n(5,6): 🌙\nLines:\n- 🌙🌙 at (5,1) and (5,2) - 1 line\n- 🌊🌊 at (5,3) and (5,4) - 1 line\nTotal for Row 5: 2 lines\n\nRow 6:\n(6,1): 🌊\n(6,2): 🌙\n(6,3): 🌊\n(6,4): 🐛\n(6,5): 🐆\n(6,6): 🌊\nLines: None\n\nTotal for horizontal lines: 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 0 = 6 lines\n\nSo the total number of lines is 6 horizontal + 7 vertical = 13 lines.\n\nActually, let me double-check Column 2:\n(1,2): 🐆\n(2,2): 🐆\n(3,2): 🦞\n(4,2): 🦞\n(5,2): 🌙\n(6,2): 🌙\n\nUpon closer inspection, there are indeed 3 vertical lines in Column 2:\n- 🐆🐆 at (1,2) and (2,2)\n- 🦞🦞 at (3,2) and (4,2)\n- 🌙🌙 at (5,2) and (6,2)\n\nSo the total number of vertical lines is 7, and the total number of lines is 6 + 7 = 13.\n\nActually, let me double-check again to make sure. I still might have made a mistake about which column is which.\n\nColumn 1:\n(1,1)🦞\n(2,1)🌊\n(3,1)🌊\n(4,1)🐆\n(5,1)🌙\n(6,1)🌊\nVertical lines: 🌊🌊 at (2,1) and (3,1) - 1 line\n\nColumn 2:\n(1,2)🐆\n(2,2)🐆\n(3,2)🦞\n(4,2)🦞\n(5,2)🌙\n(6,2)🌙\nVertical lines:\n- 🐆🐆 at (1,2) and (2,2) - 1 line\n- 🦞🦞 at (3,2) and (4,2) - 1 line\n- 🌙🌙 at (5,2) and (6,2) - 1 line\nTotal for Column 2: 3 lines\n\nGreat, this matches my previous count for Columns 1 and 2. Let's continue:\n\nColumn 3:\n(1,3)🐆\n(2,3)🦞\n(3,3)🌊\n(4,3)🌊\n(5,3)🌊\n(6,3)🌊\nVertical lines: 🌊🌊🌊🌊 at (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), and (6,3) - 1 line\n\nColumn 4:\n(1,4)🐛\n(2,4)🦞\n(3,4)🐆\n(4,4)🌊\n(5,4)🌊\n(6,4)🐛\nVertical lines: 🌊🌊 at (4,4) and (5,4) - 1 line\n\nColumn 5:\n(1,5)🐆\n(2,5)🌊\n(3,5)🦞\n(4,5)🐆\n(5,5)🐛\n(6,5)🐆\nVertical lines: None\n\nColumn 6:\n(1,6)🐆\n(2,6)🌙\n(3,6)🌙\n(4,6)🐛\n(5,6)🌙\n(6,6)🌊\nVertical lines: 🌙🌙 at (2,6) and (3,6) - 1 line\n\nTotal for vertical lines: 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 7 lines\n\nThis confirms my count of 7 vertical lines.\n\nNow let's recheck the horizontal lines:\n\nRow 1:\n(1,1)🦞 (1,2)🐆 (1,3)🐆 (1,4)🐛 (1,5)🐆 (1,6)🐆\nHorizontal lines:\n- 🐆🐆 at (1,2) and (1,3) - 1 line\n- 🐆🐆 at (1,5) and (1,6) - 1 line\nTotal for Row 1: 2 lines\n\nRow 2:\n(2,1)🌊 (2,2)🐆 (2,3)🦞 (2,4)🦞 (2,5)🌊 (2,6)🌙\nHorizontal lines: 🦞🦞 at (2,3) and (2,4) - 1 line\n\nRow 3:\n(3,1)🌊 (3,2)🦞 (3,3)🌊 (3,4)🐆 (3,5)🦞 (3,6)🌙\nHorizontal lines: None\n\nRow 4:\n(4,1)🐆 (4,2)🦞 (4,3)🌊 (4,4)🌊 (4,5)🐆 (4,6)🐛\nHorizontal lines: 🌊🌊 at (4,3) and (4,4) - 1 line\n\nRow 5:\n(5,1)🌙 (5,2)🌙 (5,3)🌊 (5,4)🌊 (5,5)🐛 (5,6)🌙\nHorizontal lines:\n- 🌙🌙 at (5,1) and (5,2) - 1 line\n- 🌊🌊 at (5,3) and (5,4) - 1 line\nTotal for Row 5: 2 lines\n\nRow 6:\n(6,1)🌊 (6,2)🌙 (6,3)🌊 (6,4)🐛 (6,5)🐆 (6,6)🌊\nHorizontal lines: None\n\nTotal for horizontal lines: 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 0 = 6 lines\n\nThis confirms my count of 6 horizontal lines.\n\nSo the final count is 6 horizontal lines + 7 vertical lines = 13 lines.\n\nAlright, I've rechecked everything and I'm confident in my answer: there are 13 lines in total.To solve this problem, I need to count all horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more.\n\nLet me analyze the board systematically:\n\n```\n🦞🐆🐆🐛🐆🐆\n🌊🐆🦞🦞🌊🌙\n🌊🦞🌊🐆🦞🌙\n🐆🦞🌊🌊🐆🐛\n🌙🌙🌊🌊🐛🌙\n🌊🌙🌊🐛🐆🌊\n```\n\nFirst, I'll count horizontal lines (same emoji in a row):\n\nRow 1:\n- 🐆🐆 (positions 2-3)\n- 🐆🐆 (positions 5-6)\n\nRow 2:\n- 🦞🦞 (positions 3-4)\n\nRow 3:\n- No horizontal lines\n\nRow 4:\n- 🌊🌊 (positions 3-4)\n\nRow 5:\n- 🌙🌙 (positions 1-2)\n- 🌊🌊 (positions 3-4)\n\nRow 6:\n- No horizontal lines\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 6\n\nNow for vertical lines (same emoji in a column):\n\nColumn 1:\n- 🌊🌊 (positions 2-3)\n\nColumn 2:\n- 🐆🐆 (positions 1-2)\n- 🦞🦞 (positions 3-4)\n- 🌙🌙 (positions 5-6)\n\nColumn 3:\n- 🌊🌊🌊🌊 (positions 3-6) - one line of length 4\n\nColumn 4:\n- 🌊🌊 (positions 4-5)\n\nColumn 5:\n- No vertical lines\n\nColumn 6:\n- 🌙🌙 (positions 2-3)\n\nTotal vertical lines: 7\n\nAdding both: 6 horizontal lines + 7 vertical lines = 13 lines total.\n\nAnswer: 13"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Column 5 consists of the following emojis from top to bottom: 🪐, ☀️, 🪐, ☀️, ❄️, ❄️.\n\nSo, for Column 5, I only see one line: ❄️❄️ (2 consecutive ❄️ emojis in Rows 5-6).\n\nSimilarly, I need to check the other columns again:\n\nColumn 6 consists of the following emojis from top to bottom: ❄️, ☀️, ❄️, ☀️, ❄️, 🐮.\n\nFor Column 6, I don't see two consecutive ❄️ emojis as I previously noted.\n\nLet me visualize each column to ensure clarity:\n\nColumn 1: ☀️, 🪐, 🪐, ☀️, ❄️, 🐮\nColumn 2: ❄️, 🪐, ☀️, 🐮, ☀️, ☀️\nColumn 3: 🪐, 🪐, ❄️, 🪐, 🐮, ☀️\nColumn 4: ☀️, 🐮, ❄️, ☀️, ☀️, 🐮\nColumn 5: 🪐, ☀️, 🪐, ☀️, ❄️, ❄️\nColumn 6: ❄️, ☀️, ❄️, ☀️, ❄️, 🐮\n\nNow, let's identify the vertical lines again:\n\nColumn 1:\n- 🪐🪐 (2 consecutive 🪐 emojis in Rows 2-3)\n\nColumn 2:\n- ☀️☀️ (2 consecutive ☀️ emojis in Rows 5-6)\n\nColumn 3:\n- 🪐🪐 (2 consecutive 🪐 emojis in Rows 1-2)\n\nColumn 4:\n- ☀️☀️ (2 consecutive ☀️ emojis in Rows 4-5)\n\nColumn 5:\n- ❄️❄️ (2 consecutive ❄️ emojis in Rows 5-6)\n\nColumn 6:\n- No consecutive emojis of the same type.\n\nI see I've been making various mistakes in reading the columns.\n\nHmm, I'm not confident still. Let's try once more with a clearer approach.\n\nI'll represent the board more systematically, replacing the emojis with letters for clarity:\nA for ☀️\nB for ❄️\nC for 🪐\nD for 🐮\n\nSo the board becomes:\n```\nA B C A C B\nC C C D A A\nC A B B C B\nA D C A A A\nB A D A B B\nD A A D B D\n```\n\nNow, let me count the horizontal lines:\n\nRow 1: No lines of 2 or more consecutive letters.\n\nRow 2:\n- CCC (3 consecutive C's, Columns 1-3)\n- AA (2 consecutive A's, Columns 5-6)\n\nRow 3:\n- BB (2 consecutive B's, Columns 3-4)\n\nRow 4:\n- AAA (3 consecutive A's, Columns 4-6)\n\nRow 5:\n- BB (2 consecutive B's, Columns 5-6)\n\nRow 6:\n- AA (2 consecutive A's, Columns 2-3)\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 6\n\nNow, let's count the vertical lines:\n\nColumn 1:\n- CC (2 consecutive C's, Rows 2-3)\n\nColumn 2:\n- No vertical lines of 2 or more consecutive letters.\n\nColumn 3:\n- CC (2 consecutive C's, Rows 1-2)\n\nColumn 4:\n- AA (2 consecutive A's, Rows 4-5)\n\nColumn 5:\n- BB (2 consecutive B's, Rows 5-6)\n\nColumn 6:\n- No vertical lines of 2 or more consecutive letters.\n\nTotal vertical lines: 4\n\nTotal number of horizontal and vertical lines: 6 + 4 = 10.\n\nI'm still having trouble interpreting the columns. Let me explicitly list out the values in each column from the original board:\n\nColumn 1:\n1. ☀️\n2. 🪐\n3. 🪐\n4. ☀️\n5. ❄️\n6. 🐮\n\nColumn 2:\n1. ❄️\n2. 🪐\n3. ☀️\n4. 🐮\n5. ☀️\n6. ☀️\n\nColumn 3:\n1. 🪐\n2. 🪐\n3. ❄️\n4. 🪐\n5. 🐮\n6. ☀️\n\nColumn 4:\n1. ☀️\n2. 🐮\n3. ❄️\n4. ☀️\n5. ☀️\n6. 🐮\n\nColumn 5:\n1. 🪐\n2. ☀️\n3. 🪐\n4. ☀️\n5. ❄️\n6. ❄️\n\nColumn 6:\n1. ❄️\n2. ☀️\n3. ❄️\n4. ☀️\n5. ❄️\n6. 🐮\n\nNow, checking for vertical lines again:\n\nColumn 1:\n- 🪐🪐 (2 consecutive 🪐 emojis in Rows 2-3)\n\nColumn 2:\n- ☀️☀️ (2 consecutive ☀️ emojis in Rows 5-6)\n\nColumn 3:\n- 🪐🪐 (2 consecutive 🪐 emojis in Rows 1-2)\n\nColumn 4:\n- ☀️☀️ (2 consecutive ☀️ emojis in Rows 4-5)\n\nColumn 5:\n- ❄️❄️ (2 consecutive ❄️ emojis in Rows 5-6)\n\nColumn 6:\n- No consecutive emojis of the same type.\n\nTotal vertical lines: 5\n\nTotal number of horizontal and vertical lines: 6 + 5 = 11.\n\nWait a sec, let me look at Column 6 more closely. I see the emojis as ❄️, ☀️, ❄️, ☀️, ❄️, 🐮. There's no consecutive pair of the same emoji in this column.\n\nLet me also double-check Column 3 to make sure I read it correctly. I see the emojis as 🪐, 🪐, ❄️, 🪐, 🐮, ☀️. Here, I have 🪐🪐 in Rows 1-2, but I don't see any other consecutive emojis of the same type.\n\nAlright so my count for vertical lines stands at 5: one each for columns 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nLet's also re-check the horizontal lines:\n\nRow 1: ☀️, ❄️, 🪐, ☀️, 🪐, ❄️ - No consecutive emojis of the same type.\n\nRow 2: 🪐, 🪐, 🪐, 🐮, ☀️, ☀️\n- 🪐🪐🪐 (3 consecutive 🪐 emojis in Columns 1-3)\n- ☀️☀️ (2 consecutive ☀️ emojis in Columns 5-6)\n\nRow 3: 🪐, ☀️, ❄️, ❄️, 🪐, ❄️\n- ❄️❄️ (2 consecutive ❄️ emojis in Columns 3-4)\n\nRow 4: ☀️, 🐮, 🪐, ☀️, ☀️, ☀️\n- ☀️☀️☀️ (3 consecutive ☀️ emojis in Columns 4-6)\n\nRow 5: ❄️, ☀️, 🐮, ☀️, ❄️, ❄️\n- ❄️❄️ (2 consecutive ❄️ emojis in Columns 5-6)\n\nRow 6: 🐮, ☀️, ☀️, 🐮, ❄️, 🐮\n- ☀️☀️ (2 consecutive ☀️ emojis in Columns 2-3)\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 6\n\nTotal number of horizontal and vertical lines: 6 + 5 = 11.\n\nActually, wait. Let me check one more time on column 4. I have the column listed as 1. ☀️, 2. 🐮, 3. ❄️, 4. ☀️, 5. ☀️, 6. 🐮. I see ☀️☀️ in Rows 4-5, which is just one vertical line.\n\nLet's see, one vertical line for each of the 5 columns. So that's 5 vertical lines, and 6 horizontal lines, for a total of 11 lines.\n\nOne more check:\n\nI'm verifying the original board:\n```\n☀️❄️🪐☀️🪐❄️\n🪐🪐🪐🐮☀️☀️\n🪐☀️❄️❄️🪐❄️\n☀️🐮🪐☀️☀️☀️\n❄️☀️🐮☀️❄️❄️\n🐮☀️☀️🐮❄️🐮\n```\n\nGoing through the horizontal lines:\n\nRow 1: ☀️, ❄️, 🪐, ☀️, 🪐, ❄️ - No consecutive emojis of the same type.\n\nRow 2: 🪐, 🪐, 🪐, 🐮, ☀️, ☀️\n- 🪐🪐🪐 (3 consecutive 🪐 emojis in Columns 1-3)\n- ☀️☀️ (2 consecutive ☀️ emojis in Columns 5-6)\n\nRow 3: 🪐, ☀️, ❄️, ❄️, 🪐, ❄️\n- ❄️❄️ (2 consecutive ❄️ emojis in Columns 3-4)\n\nRow 4: ☀️, 🐮, 🪐, ☀️, ☀️, ☀️\n- ☀️☀️☀️ (3 consecutive ☀️ emojis in Columns 4-6)\n\nRow 5: ❄️, ☀️, 🐮, ☀️, ❄️, ❄️\n- ❄️❄️ (2 consecutive ❄️ emojis in Columns 5-6)\n\nRow 6: 🐮, ☀️, ☀️, 🐮, ❄️, 🐮\n- ☀️☀️ (2 consecutive ☀️ emojis in Columns 2-3)\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 6\n\nNow, going through the vertical lines one by one, explicitly listing the emojis in each column:\n\nColumn 1: ☀️, 🪐, 🪐, ☀️, ❄️, 🐮\n- 🪐🪐 (2 consecutive 🪐 emojis in Rows 2-3)\n\nColumn 2: ❄️, 🪐, ☀️, 🐮, ☀️, ☀️\n- ☀️☀️ (2 consecutive ☀️ emojis in Rows 5-6)\n\nColumn 3: 🪐, 🪐, ❄️, 🪐, 🐮, ☀️\n- 🪐🪐 (2 consecutive 🪐 emojis in Rows 1-2)\n\nWait, there's an inconsistency in how I'm reading column 3. Let me double-check the original board:\n```\n☀️❄️🪐☀️🪐❄️\n🪐🪐🪐🐮☀️☀️\n🪐☀️❄️❄️🪐❄️\n☀️🐮🪐☀️☀️☀️\n❄️☀️🐮☀️❄️❄️\n🐮☀️☀️🐮❄️🐮\n```\n\nIn this representation, the board is organized row by row, and each row is a continuous sequence of emojis from left to right.\n\nSo, Column 3 (the third column) would have the emojis:\n1. 🪐 (from Row 1)\n2. 🪐 (from Row 2)\n3. ❄️ (from Row 3)\n4. 🪐 (from Row 4)\n5. 🐮 (from Row 5)\n6. ☀️ (from Row 6)\n\nI think I was right initially: 🪐🪐 in Rows 1-2 of Column 3.\n\nok so now I can finish the count for vertical lines:\n\nColumn 3: 🪐, 🪐, ❄️, 🪐, 🐮, ☀️\n- 🪐🪐 (2 consecutive 🪐 emojis in Rows 1-2)\n\nColumn 4: ☀️, 🐮, ❄️, ☀️, ☀️, 🐮\n- ☀️☀️ (2 consecutive ☀️ emojis in Rows 4-5)\n\nColumn 5: 🪐, ☀️, 🪐, ☀️, ❄️, ❄️\n- ❄️❄️ (2 consecutive ❄️ emojis in Rows 5-6)\n\nColumn 6: ❄️, ☀️, ❄️, ☀️, ❄️, 🐮\n- No consecutive emojis of the same type.\n\nTotal vertical lines: 5\n\nTotal number of horizontal and vertical lines: 6 + 5 = 11.\n\nActually, let me go back to the problem to make sure I understood what the problem is looking for.\n\nThe problem asks for \"the number of horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more\"\n\nSo, I need to count how many lines (horizontal or vertical) there are where the same emoji appears 2 or more times consecutively. This is exactly what I've been doing. In my counting I've identified:\n- 6 horizontal lines\n- 5 vertical lines\n\nOk, but actually let me double-check Column 6. I have it as \n❄️, ☀️, ❄️, ☀️, ❄️, 🐮.\n\nWait, there's no consecutive pair of the same emoji here. I think I was right earlier when I said there are no vertical lines in Column 6.\n\nLet me go through the board row by row to create the columns:\n\nRow 1: ☀️, ❄️, 🪐, ☀️, 🪐, ❄️\nRow 2: 🪐, 🪐, 🪐, 🐮, ☀️, ☀️\nRow 3: 🪐, ☀️, ❄️, ❄️, 🪐, ❄️\nRow 4: ☀️, 🐮, 🪐, ☀️, ☀️, ☀️\nRow 5: ❄️, ☀️, 🐮, ☀️, ❄️, ❄️\nRow 6: 🐮, ☀️, ☀️, 🐮, ❄️, 🐮\n\nColumn 1: ☀️, 🪐, 🪐, ☀️, ❄️, 🐮\nColumn 2: ❄️, 🪐, ☀️, 🐮, ☀️, ☀️\nColumn 3: 🪐, 🪐, ❄️, 🪐, 🐮, ☀️\nColumn 4: ☀️, 🐮, ❄️, ☀️, ☀️, 🐮\nColumn 5: 🪐, ☀️, 🪐, ☀️, ❄️, ❄️\nColumn 6: ❄️, ☀️, ❄️, ☀️, ❄️, 🐮\n\nLooking at column 6, as expected, I don't see consecutive emojis.\n\nGoing through the vertical lines one more time to finalize:\n\nColumn 1: ☀️, 🪐, 🪐, ☀️, ❄️, 🐮\n- 🪐🪐 (2 consecutive 🪐 emojis in Rows 2-3)\n\nColumn 2: ❄️, 🪐, ☀️, 🐮, ☀️, ☀️\n- ☀️☀️ (2 consecutive ☀️ emojis in Rows 5-6)\n\nColumn 3: 🪐, 🪐, ❄️, 🪐, 🐮, ☀️\n- 🪐🪐 (2 consecutive 🪐 emojis in Rows 1-2)\n\nWait, that doesn't look right. If column 3 is the 3rd column of the original board, then the value in the 1st row is 🪐, and the value in the 2nd row is 🪐. So the column starts with 🪐🪐, which is 2 consecutive 🪐 emojis.\n\nI'm sorry for the confusion. I think I need to be more systematic about this. Let me re-write the whole board, assigning indices to each row and column, counting from 0:\n\n```\n      0  1  2  3  4  5 (Columns)\n    ------------------\n 0 | ☀️ ❄️ 🪐 ☀️ 🪐 ❄️\n 1 | 🪐 🪐 🪐 🐮 ☀️ ☀️\n 2 | 🪐 ☀️ ❄️ ❄️ 🪐 ❄️\n 3 | ☀️ 🐮 🪐 ☀️ ☀️ ☀️\n 4 | ❄️ ☀️ 🐮 ☀️ ❄️ ❄️\n 5 | 🐮 ☀️ ☀️ 🐮 ❄️ 🐮\n (Rows)\n```\n\nNow, let me go through the horizontal lines:\n\nRow 0: ☀️, ❄️, 🪐, ☀️, 🪐, ❄️\n- No consecutive emojis of the same type.\n\nRow 1: 🪐, 🪐, 🪐, 🐮, ☀️, ☀️\n- 🪐🪐🪐 (3 consecutive 🪐 emojis in Columns 0, 1, 2)\n- ☀️☀️ (2 consecutive ☀️ emojis in Columns 4, 5)\n\nRow 2: 🪐, ☀️, ❄️, ❄️, 🪐, ❄️\n- ❄️❄️ (2 consecutive ❄️ emojis in Columns 2, 3)\n\nRow 3: ☀️, 🐮, 🪐, ☀️, ☀️, ☀️\n- ☀️☀️☀️ (3 consecutive ☀️ emojis in Columns 3, 4, 5)\n\nRow 4: ❄️, ☀️, 🐮, ☀️, ❄️, ❄️\n- ❄️❄️ (2 consecutive ❄️ emojis in Columns 4, 5)\n\nRow 5: 🐮, ☀️, ☀️, 🐮, ❄️, 🐮\n- ☀️☀️ (2 consecutive ☀️ emojis in Columns 1, 2)\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 6\n\nNow, going through the vertical lines:\n\nColumn 0: ☀️, 🪐, 🪐, ☀️, ❄️, 🐮\n- 🪐🪐 (2 consecutive 🪐 emojis in Rows 1, 2)\n\nColumn 1: ❄️, 🪐, ☀️, 🐮, ☀️, ☀️\n- ☀️☀️ (2 consecutive ☀️ emojis in Rows 4, 5)\n\nColumn 2: 🪐, 🪐, ❄️, 🪐, 🐮, ☀️\n- 🪐🪐 (2 consecutive 🪐 emojis in Rows 0, 1)\n\nColumn 3: ☀️, 🐮, ❄️, ☀️, ☀️, 🐮\n- ☀️☀️ (2 consecutive ☀️ emojis in Rows 3, 4)\n\nColumn 4: 🪐, ☀️, 🪐, ☀️, ❄️, ❄️\n- ❄️❄️ (2 consecutive ❄️ emojis in Rows 4, 5)\n\nColumn 5: ❄️, ☀️, ❄️, ☀️, ❄️, 🐮\n- No consecutive emojis of the same type.\n\nTotal vertical lines: 5\n\nTotal number of horizontal and vertical lines: 6 + 5 = 11.\n\nHmm, but wait, I'm doing a consistency check on column 2. In column 2, I have the sequence I claimed as 🪐, 🪐, ❄️, 🪐, 🐮, ☀️, so the first two emojis should be 🪐. But going back at the original board, the emoji in Row 0, Column 2 is 🪐, and the emoji in Row 1, Column 2 is 🪐. So my claim is consistent with the board.\n\nActually, I see the problem. The indices are swapped. Let me redefine the board, where the columns go horizontally (from left to right) and the rows go vertically (from top to bottom), which is the conventional way:\n\n```\n      0  1  2  3  4  5 (Columns)\n    ------------------\n 0 | ☀️ ❄️ 🪐 ☀️ 🪐 ❄️\n 1 | 🪐 🪐 🪐 🐮 ☀️ ☀️\n 2 | 🪐 ☀️ ❄️ ❄️ 🪐 ❄️\n 3 | ☀️ 🐮 🪐 ☀️ ☀️ ☀️\n 4 | ❄️ ☀️ 🐮 ☀️ ❄️ ❄️\n 5 | 🐮 ☀️ ☀️ 🐮 ❄️ 🐮\n (Rows)\n```\n\nSo Column 2 goes from top to bottom: 🪐, 🪐, ❄️, 🪐, 🐮, ☀️.\n\nI think I was right to find 🪐🪐, which is in Rows 0, 1 of Column 2. But that's not right, because if we look at the board, the emoji in Row 0, Column 2 is 🪐, but the emoji in Row 1, Column 2 is 🪐, not 🪐. \n\nActually, wait. I made a big mistake earler. Column 2 is the 3rd column from the left (indexed from 0), and if we look at the emoji at Row 0, Column 2, we see 🪐. If we then look at Row 1, Column 2, we also see 🪐.\n\nOk I think I need to work with the actual emoji characters, not my ASCII representation, in case tha's the source of the problem. Let me refer to the original problem and explicitly list the emojis for Column 2:\n\nOriginal board:\n```\n☀️❄️🪐☀️🪐❄️\n🪐🪐🪐🐮☀️☀️\n🪐☀️❄️❄️🪐❄️\n☀️🐮🪐☀️☀️☀️\n❄️☀️🐮☀️❄️❄️\n🐮☀️☀️🐮❄️🐮\n```\n\nIn the 3rd column from the left (index 2 if we start counting from 0):\n\nRow 0: 🪐\nRow 1: 🪐\nRow 2: ❄️\nRow 3: 🪐\nRow 4: 🐮\nRow 5: ☀️\n\nSo, in Column 2, I have 🪐🪐 (2 consecutive 🪐 emojis in Rows 0, 1).\n\nOk, just to be super explicit and unambiguous, let me label the board with all the indices:\n\n```\n     0    1    2    3    4    5  (Columns)\n   -----------------------------\n0 | ☀️   ❄️   🪐   ☀️   🪐   ❄️\n1 | 🪐   🪐   🪐   🐮   ☀️   ☀️\n2 | 🪐   ☀️   ❄️   ❄️   🪐   ❄️\n3 | ☀️   🐮   🪐   ☀️   ☀️   ☀️\n4 | ❄️   ☀️   🐮   ☀️   ❄️   ❄️\n5 | 🐮   ☀️   ☀️   🐮   ❄️   🐮\n(Rows)\n```\n\nNow, let's go through the horizontal lines:\n\nRow 0:\n- No consecutive emojis of the same type.\n\nRow 1:\n- 🪐🪐🪐 (3 consecutive 🪐 emojis in Columns 0, 1, 2)\n- ☀️☀️ (2 consecutive ☀️ emojis in Columns 4, 5)\n\nRow 2:\n- ❄️❄️ (2 consecutive ❄️ emojis in Columns 2, 3)\n\nRow 3:\n- ☀️☀️☀️ (3 consecutive ☀️ emojis in Columns 3, 4, 5)\n\nRow 4:\n- ❄️❄️ (2 consecutive ❄️ emojis in Columns 4, 5)\n\nRow 5:\n- ☀️☀️ (2 consecutive ☀️ emojis in Columns 1, 2)\n\nTotal horizontal lines: 6\n\nNow, going through the vertical lines:\n\nColumn 0:\n- 🪐🪐 (2 consecutive 🪐 emojis in Rows 1, 2)\n\nColumn 1:\n- ☀️☀️ (2 consecutive ☀️ emojis in Rows 4, 5)\n\nColumn 2:\n- 🪐🪐 (2 consecutive 🪐 emojis in Rows 0, 1)\n\nColumn 3:\n- ☀️☀️ (2 consecutive ☀️ emojis in Rows 3, 4)\n\nColumn 4:\n- ❄️❄️ (2 consecutive ❄️ emojis in Rows 4, 5)\n\nColumn 5:\n- No consecutive emojis of the same type.\n\nTotal vertical lines: 5\n\nTotal number of horizontal and vertical lines: 6 + 5 = 11.\n\nLet me just double-check here:\n\n- Row 3: ☀️, 🐮, 🪐, ☀️, ☀️, ☀️. I claimed that Column 3 has the emoji ☀️ in Row 3. Let me check: the emoji in Row 3, Column 3 is ☀️. Good.\n\n- Column 2 (3rd column from the left): 🪐, 🪐, ❄️, 🪐, 🐮, ☀️. I claimed that Rows 0 and 1 in Column 2 have the emoji 🪐. Let me check: the emoji in Row 0, Column 2 is 🪐, and the emoji in Row 1, Column 2 is 🪐. Good, I found a 🪐🪐 vertical line, so that's 1 vertical line for Column 2.\n\n- Column 3 (4th column from the left): ☀️, 🐮, ❄️, ☀️, ☀️, 🐮. I claimed that Rows 3 and 4 in Column 3 have the emoji ☀️. Let me check: the emoji in Row 3, Column 3 is ☀️, and the emoji in Row 4, Column 3 is ☀️. Good, I found a ☀️☀️ vertical line, so that's 1 vertical line for Column 3.\n\nSo, the total count for horizontal and vertical lines should indeed be 6 + 5 = 11.\n\nActually, let me just do a straightforward check. Looking at the board clearly, let me count all lines:\n\nHorizontal lines:\n- Line 1: 🪐🪐🪐 (Row 1, Columns 0-2)\n- Line 2: ☀️☀️ (Row 1, Columns 4-5)\n- Line 3: ❄️❄️ (Row 2, Columns 2-3)\n- Line 4: ☀️☀️☀️ (Row 3, Columns 3-5)\n- Line 5: ❄️❄️ (Row 4, Columns 4-5)\n- Line 6: ☀️☀️ (Row 5, Columns 1-2)\n\nThat's 6 horizontal lines.\n\nVertical lines:\n- Line 7: 🪐🪐 (Column 0, Rows 1-2)\n- Line 8: ☀️☀️ (Column 1, Rows 4-5)\n- Line 9: 🪐🪐 (Column 2, Rows 0-1)\n- Line 10: ☀️☀️ (Column 3, Rows 3-4)\n- Line 11: ❄️❄️ (Column 4, Rows 4-5)\n\nThat's 5 vertical lines.\n\nTotal: 6 + 5 = 11 lines.I need to count the horizontal or vertical lines formed by the same emoji, with a length of 2 or more on the given board.\n\nLet me first identify the horizontal lines (rows):\n\nRow 1: No consecutive same emojis\nRow 2: 🪐🪐🪐 (3 consecutive 🪐) and ☀️☀️ (2 consecutive ☀️)\nRow 3: ❄️❄️ (2 consecutive ❄️)\nRow 4: ☀️☀️☀️ (3 consecutive ☀️)\nRow 5: ❄️❄️ (2 consecutive ❄️)\nRow 6: ☀️☀️ (2 consecutive ☀️)\n\nThat's 6 horizontal lines.\n\nNow let me identify the vertical lines (columns):\n\nColumn 1: 🪐🪐 (2 consecutive 🪐)\nColumn 2: ☀️☀️ (2 consecutive ☀️)\nColumn 3: 🪐🪐 (2 consecutive 🪐)\nColumn 4: ☀️☀️ (2 consecutive ☀️)\nColumn 5: ❄️❄️ (2 consecutive ❄️)\nColumn 6: No consecutive same emojis\n\nThat's 5 vertical lines.\n\nAdding them up: 6 + 5 = 11 total lines.\n\nAnswer: 11"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.
