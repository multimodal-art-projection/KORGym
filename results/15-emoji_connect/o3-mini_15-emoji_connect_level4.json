Count Vertical Lines\n\nLet’s index columns 1 through 10. We list the emojis from row1 to row10 in each column and look for contiguous identical entries.\n\nColumn1:  \nRow1: 🎃  \nRow2: 🌒  \nRow3: 🐫  \nRow4: 🎃  \nRow5: 🕷  \nRow6: 🌒  \nRow7: 🦆  \nRow8: 🎃  \nRow9: 🌒  \nRow10: 🦆  \nNo adjacent pair is identical. → count = 0\n\nColumn2:  \nRow1: 🦆  \nRow2: 🐃  \nRow3: 🐫  \nRow4: 🦆  \nRow5: 🐃  \nRow6: 🐫  \nRow7: 🐫  \nRow8: 🎃  \nRow9: 🐫  \nRow10: 🌔  \nCheck adjacent:  \n Between Row6 and Row7: 🐫 then 🐫 → group of length 2.  \nNo other repeats. → count = 1\n\nColumn3:  \nRow1: 🦆  \nRow2: 🎃  \nRow3: 🐃  \nRow4: 🌔  \nRow5: 🐃  \nRow6: 🎃  \nRow7: 🌔  \nRow8: 🎃  \nRow9: 🐫  \nRow10: 🐃  \nNo adjacent repeats. → count = 0\n\nColumn4:  \nRow1: 🐃  \nRow2: 🐃  \nRow3: 🌔  \nRow4: 🎃  \nRow5: 🌔  \nRow6: 🎃  \nRow7: 🕷? Actually, let’s be careful:  \n Row1: cell (1,4) = 🐃  \n Row2: (2,4) = 🐃  \n Row3: (3,4) = 🌔  \n Row4: (4,4) = 🎃  \n Row5: (5,4) = 🌔  \n Row6: (6,4) = 🎃  \n Row7: (7,4) = 🕷  \n Row8: (8,4) = 🌒  \n Row9: (9,4) = 🐃  \n Row10: (10,4) = 🌔  \nNow, Groups:  \n Rows1–2: 🐃,🐃 → group (count 1)  \nNo other adjacent same. → count = 1\n\nColumn5:  \nRow1: 🕷  \nRow2: 🦆  \nRow3: 🌖  \nRow4: 🌖? Check Row4, col5: Row4: cell (4,5) = 🌖  \nRow5: (5,5) = 🦆  \nRow6: (6,5) = 🐫  \nRow7: (7,5) = 🌔  \nRow8: (8,5) = 🕷  \nRow9: (9,5) = 🕷  \nRow10: (10,5) = 🌔  \nCheck adjacent:  \n Row3 to Row4: 🌖 then 🌖 → group (count 1)  \n Row8 to Row9: 🕷 then 🕷 → group (count 1)  \n→ count = 2\n\nColumn6:  \nRow1: 🌔  \nRow2: 🕷  \nRow3: 🌖  \nRow4: 🌒  \nRow5: 🐫  \nRow6: 🌒  \nRow7: 🦆  \nRow8: 🌖  \nRow9: 🕷  \nRow10: 🐫? Let’s check: Row10, col6 = 🐫  \nNo adjacent same?  \n Row5 is 🐫 then row6 is 🌒; row9 is 🕷 then row10 is 🐫, etc.  \n→ count = 0\n\nColumn7:  \nRow1: 🌔  \nRow2: 🦆  \nRow3: 🌒  \nRow4: 🐫  \nRow5: 🕷  \nRow6: 🎃  \nRow7: 🌔  \nRow8: 🌒  \nRow9: 🐃  \nRow10: 🌒  \nCheck: No adjacent same?  \n Row8 (🌒) then Row9 (🐃) then Row10 (🌒) are not equal, etc.  \n→ count = 0\n\nColumn8:  \nRow1: 🦆? Let’s check: Row1, col8 = 🦆  \nRow2: 🦆 (col8)  \nRow3: 🌖 (col8)  \nRow4: 🐃  \nRow5: 🐫  \nRow6: 🕷  \nRow7: 🦆  \nRow8: 🐃  \nRow9: 🕷  \nRow10: 🎃  \nGroups:  \n Rows1–2: 🦆,🦆 → group (count 1)  \nNo other adjacent identical.  \n→ count = 1\n\nColumn9:  \nRow1: 🕷  \nRow2: 🌒  \nRow3: 🦆  \nRow4: 🌖  \nRow5: 🎃  \nRow6: 🎃? Check Row6, col9 = 🎃  \nRow7: 🦆? Check Row7, col9 = 🦆  \nRow8: 🌒  \nRow9: 🐃  \nRow10: 🎃? Let’s re-read carefully:  \n Row1 col9 = 🕷  \n Row2 col9 = 🌒  \n Row3 col9 = 🦆  \n Row4 col9 = 🌖  \n Row5 col9 = 🎃  \n Row6 col9 = 🎃  \n Row7 col9 = 🦆  \n Row8 col9 = 🌒  \n Row9 col9 = 🐃  \n Row10 col9 = 🎃  \nGroup:  \n Rows5–6: 🎃,🎃 → group (count 1)  \n→ count = 1\n\nColumn10:  \nRow1: 🌔  \nRow2: 🌖  \nRow3: 🐫  \nRow4: 🌖  \nRow5: 🐃  \nRow6: 🌖  \nRow7: 🌖? Check Row7, col10 = 🌖  \nRow8: 🌒? Actually Row8, col10 = 🌒  \nRow9: 🕷  \nRow10: 🌒? Check Row10, col10 = 🌒  \nLet’s list clearly:  \n Row1: col10 = 🌔  \n Row2: col10 = 🌖  \n Row3: col10 = 🐫  \n Row4: col10 = 🌖  \n Row5: col10 = 🐃  \n Row6: col10 = 🌖  \n Row7: col10 = 🌖  \n Row8: col10 = 🌒  \n Row9: col10 = 🕷  \n Row10: col10 = 🌒  \nGroups:  \n Rows6–7: 🌖,🌖 → group (count 1)  \n Rows8 to Row10? Check Row8 is 🌒 then Row9 is 🕷 (break) then Row10 is 🌒 so no consecutive.  \n→ count = 1\n\nNow, add the vertical totals:  \nCol1: 0  \nCol2: 1  \nCol3: 0  \nCol4: 1  \nCol5: 2  \nCol6: 0  \nCol7: 0  \nCol8: 1  \nCol9: 1  \nCol10: 1  \nVertical total = 0+1+0+1+2+0+0+1+1+1 = 7\n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Count\n\nTotal horizontal lines = 15  \nTotal vertical lines = 7  \nGrand total = 15 + 7 = 22\n\nThus, the answer is 22.\n\nAnswer: 22"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a question.\nYour task is:\n- First, answer the question.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.
