Given the starting position and the initial direction, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Starting Position and Initial Direction**:\n   - The protagonist 'P' starts at [0,4].\n   - Initial direction is down.\n\n2. **Navigating Through the Maze**:\n   - We follow the given actions ('R', 'L', 'D', 'R') while ensuring we move towards waypoints in order.\n   \n3. **Sequence of Actions**:\n   - 'R': Move right from [0,4] to [0,5]. Since there's a wall at [0,5], we need to adjust the direction to the next possible move which would be down. However, since the action is 'R', we will consider moving right as far as possible until we hit a wall or a waypoint.\n   - 'L': After hitting the wall at [0,5], we cannot move left from [0,4] as it's also a wall. So we need to continue moving down to find a way out.\n   - 'D': Move down from [0,4] to [1,4]. From here, we can keep moving down until we hit a wall or reach a waypoint.\n   - 'R': Once we are at a point where we can move right again, we will do so.\n\n4. **Triggering Waypoints**:\n   - As we move, we need to ensure we hit waypoints 1, 2, and 3 in sequence. This requires us to carefully choose our path based on the available movements and the layout of the maze.\n\nGiven the above considerations, we can determine the sequence of actions and the positions where waypoints are triggered:\n\n- Moving down from [0,4] to [8,4] (since the first waypoint '1' is at [8,7]).\n- Moving right from [8,4] to [8,7] to trigger waypoint '1'.\n- Moving up from [8,7] to [7,7] to avoid the wall.\n- Moving left from [7,7] to [7,4] to reach the second waypoint '2' at [7,2].\n- Moving left from [7,4] to [7,2] to trigger waypoint '2'.\n- Moving right from [7,2] to [7,5] to avoid the wall.\n- Moving down from [7,5] to [8,5] to reach the third waypoint '3' at [8,5].\n- Moving right from [8,5] to [8,5] to trigger waypoint '3'.\n\nThe sequence of actions and trigger positions would be:\n'Answer: [[\"D\",8,4], [\"R\",8,7], [\"U\",7,7], [\"L\",7,2], [\"R\",7,5], [\"D\",8,5], [\"R\",8,5]]'\n\nThis sequence ensures that all waypoints are visited in the correct order and the protagonist moves according to the device actions provided.\n\nAnswer: [[\"D\",8,4], [\"R\",8,7], [\"U\",7,7], [\"L\",7,2], [\"R\",7,5], [\"D\",8,5], [\"R\",8,5]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.
