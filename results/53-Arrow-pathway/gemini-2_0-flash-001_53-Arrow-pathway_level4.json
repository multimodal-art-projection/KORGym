The waypoint sequence is 1, 2, then 3.\n\n2. **Reaching Waypoint 1:** Waypoint 1 is at [8, 0]. To reach it from [10, 10] facing left, the player needs to move up two spaces, then left ten spaces (which is not feasible given the constraints of only being able to execute movement based on the cardinal directions defined in the prompt.) So first, we need to find a valid path to Waypoint 1. From [10,10] moving upwards is not a valid move because of a wall. First, move Right 10 times and then up 2 times.\n\n3. **Reaching Waypoint 2:** Waypoint 2 is at [7, 3]. After reaching Waypoint 1, the direction changes. We need to find actions to take us to Waypoint 2.\n\n4. **Reaching Waypoint 3:** Waypoint 3 is at [10, 0]. After reaching Waypoint 2, the direction changes.

I need to navigate the player 'P' through the maze to visit the waypoints '1', '2', and '3' in order, changing direction automatically upon reaching each waypoint. I'm given the maze layout, the initial direction, and a sequence of device actions with their counts. I will output the action sequence and trigger positions.\n\nHere's the breakdown of how I'll approach this:\n\n1.  **Initialization:** Start at 'P' with the given initial direction ('right').\n2.  **Action Execution and Waypoint Check:** Simulate the device actions one by one, moving the player until a waypoint is hit, a wall is hit, or the action count is met. After each move, check if the current position contains the next waypoint in the sequence.\n3.  **Direction Change:** If a waypoint is hit, update the current direction based on the rules of waypoint direction changes.\n4.  **Output Recording:** Record the action taken and the coordinates of the waypoint triggered.\n5.  **Termination:** Stop when all waypoints are visited, or no more actions can be performed, or the next waypoint cannot be reached.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given scenario.\n\n*   **Initial state:** Player at (3, 0), direction = 'right'. Next waypoint: 1.\n*   **Action 'D':**\n    *   Move down from (3, 0) to (4, 0). This position is '1'.\n    *   Waypoint 1 is triggered at (4, 0). Direction changes to 'up'.\n\n*   **Action 'R':**\n    *   Move up from (4, 0) to (3, 0). Wall. Can't move.\n    *   Move up from (4, 0) to (2, 0). Wall. Can't move.\n    *   Move up from (4, 0) to (1, 0). Wall. Can't move.\n    *   Move up from (4, 0) to (0, 0). Wall. Can't move.\n\n*   **Action 'U':**\n    *   Move up from (4, 0) to (3, 0). Wall. Can't move.\n    *   Move up from (4, 0) to (2, 0). Wall. Can't move.\n    *   Move up from (4, 0) to (1, 0). Wall. Can't move.\n    *   Move up from (4, 0) to (0, 0). Wall. Can't move.\n\n*   **Action 'D':**\n    *   Move up from (4, 0) to (3, 0). Wall. Can't move.\n    *   Move up from (4, 0) to (2, 0). Wall. Can't move.\n    *   Move up from (4, 0) to (1, 0). Wall. Can't move.\n    *   Move up from (4, 0) to (0, 0). Wall. Can't move.\n\nThe logic above is wrong. Let's simulate the path correctly.\n\n*   **Initial state:** Player at (3, 0), direction = 'right'. Next waypoint: 1.\n*   **Action 'D':**\n    *   Move down from (3, 0) to (4, 0). This position is '1'.\n    *   Waypoint 1 is triggered at (4, 0). Direction changes to 'up'. Next waypoint: 2.\n\n*   **Action 'R':** Doesn't make sense since the current direction is 'up'.\n    * We'll assume the actions are repeated multiple times.\n    * Move up from (4, 0) to (3, 0). This is an 'X' so we can't move.\n*   Correct Way: Start over.\n\n*   **Initial state:** Player at (3, 0), direction = 'right'. Next waypoint: 1.\n*   **Action 'D':**\n    *   Move down from (3, 0) to (4, 0). This position is '1'.\n    *   Waypoint 1 is triggered at (4, 0). Direction changes to 'up'. Next waypoint: 2.\n*   **Action 'R':** Doesn't make sense since the current direction is 'up'. I will skip the first action and consider the action count provided is just a device constraint rather than a strict sequence.\n* The first action should be to go right.\n    * Move right from (4,0) to (4,1) -> (4,2) -> (4,3).\n* Next, go up.\n    * Move up from (4,3) to (3,3) -> (2,3). This is waypoint 2.\n    * Waypoint 2 is triggered at (2, 3). Direction changes to 'left'. Next waypoint: 3.\n* Next, go down.\n    * Move left from (2,3) to (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (2,0). Can't move.\n* Next, go right, but this is incorrect since the direction is left.\n\nLet's restart the analysis again with a correct understanding of the action sequence and waypoint triggering. The action sequence must be obeyed in order, even if it means the next waypoint can not be reached.\n\n*   **Initial state:** Player at (3, 0), direction = 'right'. Next waypoint: 1.\n*   **Action 'D':**\n    *   Move down from (3, 0) to (4, 0). This position is '1'.\n    *   Waypoint 1 is triggered at (4, 0). Direction changes to 'up'. Next waypoint: 2.\n\n*   **Action 'R':** Since the current direction is 'up', the 'R' action is irrelevant and can't move. Count is still considered, hence no further move for device action 1.\n\n*   **Action 'U':** Keep going up.\n    *   Move up from (4, 0) to (3, 0). Wall. Can't move. No trigger.\n*   **Action 'D':** Keep going up.\n    *   Move up from (4, 0) to (3, 0). Wall. Can't move. No trigger.\n\nIt's not possible to reach the second waypoint, based on the action sequence provided.\n\nAnswer: [['D',4,0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

No waypoints.\n\nThis is not the right path. We need to try a different approach.\n\nStart at [9, 14], direction: left.\n\nThe first waypoint is 1 at [0, 10].\nThe second waypoint is 2 at [10, 1].\nThe third waypoint is 3 at [3, 4].\n\nSince the current direction is left, to get to waypoint 1 at [0, 10], we need to change direction at some point.\nActions: U, R, D, L, U\n\n- 'U': [9,14] -> [0,14]\n- 'R': [0,14] -> [0,15] (blocked)\n- 'D': [0,14] -> [9,14] -> [10,14]\n- 'L': [10,14] -> [10,1] (waypoint 2)\n- 'U': [10,1] -> [4,1] which doesn't lead to waypoint 3\n\nStart at [9, 14], looking left.\n\nLet's try to find a path manually.\n\n1.

Alternatively, From [0, 14] go LEFT until blocked.\n   Waypoint 1 is at [0, 10], so we need to turn at least once.\n\nGoing to waypoint 2 at [10, 1] first could be a better approach. From [9,14]:\n1. UP 'U': to [0, 14]\n2. DOWN 'D': to [10, 14]\n3. LEFT 'L': to [10, 1] <Waypoint 2 triggered>\n4. UP 'U': to [4, 1]\n\nThe action sequence U, D, L, U seems to lead to the second waypoint at [10,1]. Now, from [10,1] the direction is Up, to reach the third waypoint at [3,4], the next sequence of actions might be Right, Up. But the given actions is U, so we need to go 'U' until we hit the wall, or until we hit the X, then go Left to go to Waypoint 3 [3,4].\n\nSince waypoint 3 at [3,4] can not be reached based on the current information and the second waypoint has to be triggered first, then the answer is:\n\n```\nAnswer: [['U',0,14], ['D',10,14], ['L',10,1]]\n```"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.
