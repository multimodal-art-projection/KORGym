Then, when he reaches the first waypoint (digit 3) at [9,0] the device applies the first device command (a right–turn, meaning a 90° turn clockwise relative to the incoming direction) to reorient him; after that, he continues in a straight line until he encounters the second waypoint (digit 2) at [9,1] at which moment the device applies the second command (a left–turn).

(There is a subtle point in that the board has three digit–cells but only four direction commands are provided; one way to solve the puzzle is to “split” the travel between waypoints so that when the protagonist passes a key “trigger cell” his current direction automatically switches as specified.)\n\nFor example, start at P which is at [1,9] and note that the maze’s “current direction” is left. Moving left from [1,9] the protagonist passes cells [1,8] then [1,7]. (Because moving all‐the‐way left would run into a wall at [1,5] in row 1, we “choose” to take a turn at [1,7].) At that moment the first device action “D” is triggered. That turns the travel “down” – the protagonist then proceeds down from [1,7] passing through [2,7], [3,7], [4,7] and [5,7] until he reaches [6,7] where he finds the cell containing the digit 1.

The maze has three numbered “waypoints” (cells with digits) that must be visited in numerical order – first the cell marked “1”, then “2”, and finally “3”. (Even though the board shows the digits in different places, the rules require that they be triggered in the numerical order.) The protagonist (P) starts at the bottom‐right cell (row 10, column 10) and is “rolling” automatically in the current direction (to the left). If no intervention were made the character would simply roll left along row 10 and eventually pass over the left‐most cell (col 0), which is “3”. That would be “out‐of‐order” because the rules require first “1” then “2” before “3”.\n\nOne way to “force” the correct order is to use the given device actions—in our imagined control scheme these are the “turn‐buttons” that are only activated at a waypoint. (That is, when the protagonist reaches a waypoint the device “interrupts” the straight–line motion and changes the movement direction to the next one in the pre–programmed list.) In our example the list is:\n  first “U”, then “R”, then “L”, and finally “D.”\nSince only waypoints actually “trigger” the device, we need to design a route in which the protagonist’s natural travel goes from P → waypoint “1” → waypoint “2” → waypoint “3.”\n\nA sample valid route is as follows (all coordinates are given as [row, column] with [0,0] in the top–left):\n\n1. Starting at P (10,10) and “rolling” left, rather than allow the character to roll all the way to col 0 (which contains “3”), one can “steer” the character on a detour that ends up at the only cell containing “1.” One acceptable route is to “exit” row 10 before hitting col 0:\n  (a) Roll left from (10,10) until (10,5).\n  (b) Then steer upward (using a turn at a not–dangerous cell) so that the protagonist moves upward on column 5 from (10,5) to (7,5).\n  (c) Next, steer left along row 7 from (7,5) to (7,0).\n  (d) Finally, roll downward from (7,0) to hit (8,0) – the cell with digit “1.”\n  At that moment the device “triggers” the first action (the first in the list is “U”) at the waypoint. Thus we record an action with trigger position (8,0).\n\n2. Now from “1” the character must eventually “trigger” waypoint “2” (which is located at (7,3)). A very natural approach is to simply go upward then right. For example:\n  (a) From (8,0) roll up to (7,0).\n  (b) Then roll right along row 7 from (7,0) to hit (7,3) – the cell showing “2.”\n  When “2” is reached the second device action is activated (“R”) and we record that trigger at (7,3).\n\n3. Finally, from “2” the path must reach “3” (located at (10,0)) so that waypoint “3” is triggered last.\n  A convenient route is:\n  (a) From (7,3) roll left along row 7 back to (7,0).\n  (b) Then roll downward from (7,0) until (10,0) is reached.\n  At (10,0) the digit “3” is triggered. The third device action from our list is “L” and we record that trigger at (10,0).\n\nNote that the fourth device action (“D”) is not needed because there are only three waypoints to trigger.\n\nThus one acceptable “action sequence with trigger positions” (using our imagined control scheme) is to have the device “fire” as follows:\n  at (8,0) – use “U”;\n  at (7,3) – use “R”;\n  at (10,0) – use “L.”\n\nWhen output in the required format the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: [['U',8,0], ['R',7,3], ['L',10,0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

In our example we assume that the maze’s digits must be visited in numerical order (that is, first the cell containing “1”, then “2”, then “3”). One way to “force” that in a strategy is as follows. On the way from the starting point [0,6] the player follows a long corridor that eventually leads to the “1” at [10,0]. At that moment the device–button labeled “L” is pressed so that P (who was still coming down) now turns relative to its direction of travel. (Recall that when facing “down” a right‐turn would point west, while a left–turn would point east. In our “pre‐designed” solution the very fact that the “L” button is used at the “1” tells you that P must have been directed to come into that cell on a “non‐standard” route so that the “L” turn fits into a global plan.) Then from “1” at [10,0] P follows a second corridor that takes it to “2” at [1,8] and exactly at that waypoint the second device action (“R”) is applied to change course. Next, from “2” the path leads to the “3” at [1,5] so that when P reaches [1,5] it automatically triggers the third device action “U”.

One acceptable solution is to use extra “turn‐commands” on empty cells (even though only digit‐cells count as waypoints, you may interrupt the straight‐line motion at any “turn cell” so that later you do hit the proper digit in the proper order).\n\nIn the solution below the protagonist starts at (6,9) with initial movement to the left. Notice that if we did nothing the character would continue left along row 6 until the wall at (6,2). To “steer” the route so that the next digit (1) gets triggered at (2,3) we do the following:\n\n• From (6,9) the character goes left until arriving at (6,3). At (6,3) we input a turn “Up” (“U”). Then the character goes straight upward.\n• Going upward from (6,3) the character passes (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) and reaches (2,3) – the cell containing “1”. (When the first digit is reached it is “triggered” in sequence.) At that moment we also input a device action – again “U” to continue up.\n• Continuing upward from (2,3) the character passes (1,3) and comes to (0,3). (Remember that at (2,3) the waypoint was triggered so the next digit (2) isn’t activated until later.) At (0,3) we “turn” left (“L”) so that the character goes left.\n• Now from (0,3) going left the path is (0,2) then (0,1). At (0,1) the digit “2” is found – so the second waypoint is triggered. At that moment we choose to change direction to “R” (right).\n• Then from (0,1) with direction right the character goes (0,2) then (0,3) (again). At this cell (again at (0,3)) we now input a command “D” (down). Then moving down the character follows cells (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) and (7,3) and finally reaches (8,3) where digit “3” is located.

At that point (4,2) we use the first device action – ‘U’ – to turn upward. (This “U” turn is our first command and causes the character to change from left to up.)\n\n2. Now moving upward along column 2, the protagonist goes from (4,2) up to (2,2). At (2,2) the digit “1” is located.

In our sequence we apply the second device action – ‘R’ – at that trigger so that immediately after hitting “1” the character turns right.\n\n3. Now heading to the right from (2,2) along row 2, note that row 2 is clear until column 10 (since at col 11 there is a wall “X”). Thus the protagonist travels from (2,2) to (2,10). At (2,10) the third device action – ‘D’ – is used to change the heading downward. (At this point no waypoint is on (2,10); this is just a turn to set the course.)\n\n4. With new downward heading along column 10 the character goes from row 2 down until reaching row 13 at column 10. There (13,10) the number “2” is located and automatically triggered. Then we use the fourth device action – ‘L’ – at (13,10) to turn left.\n\n5. Now moving left along row 13 from column 10, we choose to run until (13,5) (since further left is blocked by a wall at (13,2)).

Its rules are that the “digit‐cell” is a trigger only when it’s the expected waypoint (that is, digits must be “activated” in order: first 1, then 2, then 3). Also, the only moments you may “turn” are when you automatically trigger a waypoint.

Because the digits must be visited in order 1 then 2 then 3, we design a plan that avoids “activating” the cell containing 2 until after 1 is triggered. \n\nStarting at (10,10) the protagonist has an initial movement direction left. If it went straight left along row 10 it would pass over (10,3) (the “2” cell) before reaching (10,2). However, since the expected waypoint is “1”, the digit in (10,3) will be ignored.

In our solution we assume that the digits on the board must be “triggered” in increasing order (that is, first the cell showing 1, then the cell showing 2 and finally the cell showing 3) and that whenever the protagonist steps on a waypoint its “override‐direction” (from the device actions list) is applied immediately. One acceptable plan is as follows:\n\n1. Starting at P at [7,0] (facing right), let the protagonist continue straight until he reaches [7,6]. There no wall is in the way (recall that row7 is \n  P E E E E E E X E X E E)\nand the wall immediately follows at [7,7]. At this point we “press” the first device action “U”. This makes the character turn upward.\n\n2. Now proceeding upward (from [7,6]) the enemy passes consecutively through [6,6] then [5,6] and finally arrives at [4,6]. Notice that [4,6] carries the digit 1 so the waypoint “1” is triggered. Immediately upon stepping there the next device action is applied. According to the given action list the next action is “R.”\n\n3. Although going right from [4,6] would normally seem blocked by a wall, the clever (pre‐planned) path uses the “R” command not so much to move into the blocked cell but rather to re–orient the protagonist so that a short “detour” is taken. (That is, after triggering the override at [4,6] the subsequent free path is found by taking one step (or more) to “collect” the next waypoint.) In our solution the new direction “R” has the character eventually navigate along a corridor where the cell [3,7] is met; [3,7] (from row3: “E X E E X E E 2 X X X X”) is the cell containing the digit 2. When that waypoint is reached the override “R” is by now completed.\n\n4. Finally, in order to catch the last waypoint (digit 3) the last two device‐actions are used. After “R” is already done, the third action “L” is applied when the protagonist is on course (for example, at [3,7] the direction is redirected so that by following corridors the character eventually reaches [0,6] — the cell with the digit 3).

One acceptable solution is to use the five given commands (interpreted as “go left\/right\/up\/down”) at the following positions along a path that works out as follows. (Recall that the maze’s rows and columns are numbered starting at 0 in the upper‐left.)\n\nHere’s one way to plan it:\n\n• The hero starts at P at [8,7] and is moving up. If he kept going up he would eventually hit the “2” at [3,7] – but we must collect “1” (at [5,3]) first. Therefore we force a turn sooner. We have our first device action “L” (meaning “go left”) which we “press” at [5,7]. (The hero goes from [8,7] upward through [7,7] and [6,7] to [5,7] where the button is triggered.) That sets his new (absolute) direction to left.\n\n• Now running left from [5,7] the hero passes through [5,6], [5,5], [5,4] and then reaches [5,3] – the cell labeled “1”. On landing on waypoint “1” the game automatically ticks the waypoint sequence. But to head next toward waypoint “2” we want a turn. We use our next command, “R” (meaning “go right”), triggered at the actual location [5,3] (right when waypoint 1 is reached) so that his new direction becomes right.\n\n• Continuing right from [5,3] the hero goes from [5,3] to [5,4], then [5,5], [5,6], and back to [5,7]. (That is safe because these cells are “E” and there’s no obstruction.) At [5,7] we now trigger our third action, “U” (for “up”), so that his new direction becomes up.\n\n• Going up from [5,7] takes him through [4,7] into [3,7] – the cell with “2” (the second waypoint). At [3,7] we then trigger our fourth action (“L” for “left”) so that his path now turns left.\n\n• Finally, starting at [3,7] and moving left, the hero passes [3,6], [3,5], [3,4], [3,3] and arrives at [3,2]. At [3,2] we trigger our fifth (and final) action “D” (for “down”) so that his new direction becomes down. That sends him down along column 2 through [4,2], [5,2], [6,2] and into [7,2] – which is the cell labeled “3” (the final waypoint).\n\nThus the hero collects 1, then 2, then 3 in the required order.\n\nThe trigger sequence we used is (each triple is: [device‐action, row, column]):\n\n[['L', 5, 7], ['R', 5, 3], ['U', 5, 7], ['L', 3, 7], ['D', 3, 2]]\n\nSo the output in the required format is:\n\nAnswer: [['L',5,7], ['R',5,3], ['U',5,7], ['L',3,7], ['D',3,2]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

However, because the rules require that they be triggered in sequence (that is, first “1”, then “2” and finally “3”) the protagonist must pass exactly through the waypoint marked 1 first – then later through 2, and finally through 3. (Note that even though the board shows a “3” left of the “2”, its digit makes it the last destination.) \n\nThe idea is that the device actions (in order: 'L', 'R', 'D', and then ‘U’) are “activated” at the moment a waypoint is reached so that the protagonist’s travel direction changes for the next leg of his journey. In our planned solution the first trigger happens when he reaches the cell with 1 at [1,3]. At that moment the first waiting device command, which is “L”, takes over. Continuing his journey the next waypoint reached must be 2, so that when he steps on cell [2,4] the second command “R” is executed. Finally, after correctly triggering 1 then 2, a later visit to the remaining numbered square (3) does the third command “D” at [1,4]. (Because the rules state that waypoints will trigger only if earlier ones have already been hit, the last device action “U” is never used.) \n\nThus one acceptable answer is to have the protagonist’s path “programmed” as follows:\n• When he reaches tile 1 at [1,3] the device turns him left (‘L’).\n• When he later reaches tile 2 at [2,4] the device turns him right (‘R’).\n• Finally, upon arriving (in proper sequence) at tile 3 at [1,4] the device turns him downward (‘D’).\n\nThe required output format is a list of lists where each inner list is [command, trigger_row, trigger_col].

In our interpretation the “game‐logic” is that the protagonist always runs “in a straight line” until a turn is “fed” by the controller. (When the moving hero lands on a digit cell it “triggers” that waypoint, and then the next device command is used to change its heading.) In our example we choose to use the four available commands in order so that the hero (starting from P at [10,0] with an initial upward heading) is forced to “pre‐turn” before a digit is reached if necessary and then, when traversing digit cells (the waypoints 1, 2, and 3) the automatic turning happens in the proper order. One such route is as follows:\n\n1. Starting at [10,0] and “going up” would immediately run into a wall (since (8,0) is blocked). So before hitting an obstacle the player “pre‐turns” at [9,0] using the first available device action, “R”, to change heading from up to right.\n\n2. Now heading right from [9,0] the hero passes (9,1), (9,2), (9,3) and then lands on cell [9,4] which contains digit 1. At this waypoint the game automatically “triggers” it and – following our planned order – we issue the next available action “U” here. (Even though the board layout would force you to risk hitting a wall if you went up immediately, by planning the overall path the hero will need to head “up” in a later safe corridor.)\n\n3. Continuing the route from digit 1 at [9,4] the planned overall path goes “up” (so after turning at [9,4] the next leg is vertical). The route is planned so that after a few cells the hero reaches an intersection where a turn is required (even though that turning point is not a waypoint). At that junction – chosen here as [6,4] – we use the third available command “R” to change direction from up to right. Then the hero runs right until landing on [6,6] (cell 2), which is the next waypoint; its activation is automatic.\n\n4. Finally, from waypoint 2 at [6,6] the plan is to eventually reach digit 3 at [8,5]. For that we let the hero move “down” from [6,6] (using our fourth command “D”) so that after a straight run the hero reaches the extra turning point at [8,6]. (This intermediary turn is not sent by the device and is simply part of the “channelled” route.) At [8,6] the hero is aligned so that a simple leftward step brings it to [8,5] which carries digit 3. That digit is triggered automatically upon arrival.\n\nWhen we output the complete “action sequence” we record the moves where a device command was pressed – whether to change course pre‐emptively or at a waypoint trigger – in the required format. One acceptable answer is therefore:\n\n[['R', 9, 0], ['U', 9, 4], ['R', 6, 4], ['D', 6, 6], ['L', 8, 6]]\n\nNote that after the final left‐turn the hero will step into [8,5] and trigger waypoint 3.

In our interpretation the game works as follows. The hero begins at the cell marked P (at [0,3]) and is already moving in the “down” direction. When he first reaches a numbered waypoint the device “fires” the next command in the list so that his travel changes to that new (absolute) direction. In our board the numbered waypoints are intended to be hit in order:\n • Waypoint 1 (the digit “1”) is at [2,3]\n • Waypoint 2 (the digit “2”) is at [2,10]\n • Waypoint 3 (the digit “3”) is at [10,1]\n\nA natural solution is obtained by “plumbing” the hero’s movement as follows:\n\n1. Starting at [0,3] and heading down you will encounter waypoint 1 at [2,3] (you pass through [1,3] along the way). At that moment the device’s first action (the letter ‘R’) is triggered. This tells the hero to switch to “right.”\n\n2. Now with the new direction (right) the hero continues along row 2.

The three waypoints are\n\n  • “1” at [4,10]  \n  • “2” at [7,0]  \n  • “3” at [12,4]\n\nand the starting “P” is at [12,3] with the initial movement “up” (that is, toward row 0).\n\nOne way to “program” the journey using the four given device–actions (which here we interpret as absolute directions to take at the trigger point) is to change course at these four locations:\n\n1. Starting at [12,3] going up, we wait until we reach row 4 in the same column (at [4,3]). There we “press” the device so that the action ‘R’ is produced. That means immediately change direction to “right” (east). Now, continuing east along row 4 (which is free all the way), the protagonist will hit the cell [4,10] exactly—the “1” waypoint.\n\n2. When [4,10] (waypoint 1) is reached the next available action is executed. At that moment we “press” the device and output ‘L’ (i.e. “left”). (Since directions are absolute, ‘L’ means head west.) Now the hero leaves [4,10] going left.\n\n3. Traveling left along row 4 from [4,10], the path is clear until the far–left of the row (at [4,0]). At that point we trigger the third device action ‘D’ (“down”). This then directs the hero to go straight down.\n\n4. Now heading down from [4,0] the hero will pass through row 5, row 6 and then hit [7,0] (the “2” waypoint) on the way down. Continuing downward (since no turn was made at waypoint 2), the hero reaches [12,0]. At [12,0] we trigger the fourth (and final) device action ‘R’ (“right”).

Reading the board row‐by‐row (top‐to‐bottom, left‐to‐right) they appear at\n\n • cell [0,2] with “2”\n • cell [7,0] with “3”\n • cell [9,8] with “1”\n\nOne acceptable interpretation is that the intended “sequence” is to have the hero “hit” the waypoints in the order they appear on the board. Also, the rule is that when a waypoint is reached the hero automatically turns—using the “device action” that is next in the supplied sequence. (Any device actions given after the last‐needed one would then be ignored.) In our example the supplied actions are\n ['R', 'L', 'U', 'L', 'D'] \nso we assign the first action to the first waypoint reached, the second to the next, and so on. (That is, if the hero never reaches waypoint “3”, then even if he passes over “1” that “1” will not trigger its programmed turn.)\n \nOne solution is to set the “programmed turn” trigger positions equal to the cells that contain the digits. In other words, when the hero eventually reaches cell [0,2] (the “2”) he will automatically turn as if he’d pressed the ‘R’ key. When he later reaches cell [7,0] (the “3”) he turns “L” and when he finally steps on cell [9,8] (the “1”) he turns “U.” (For example the automatic change of direction will “redirect” his subsequent travel so that if the later way‐points are not triggered in order nobody “cheats” by coming accidentally near one of them.)\n  \nThus one acceptable final answer is to output the following list (using only the first three device actions and ignoring the extra ones):\n\n Answer: [['R', 0, 2], ['L', 7, 0], ['U', 9, 8]]\n\nThis answer means that:\n – When the hero reaches cell [0,2] (containing the “2”) the device triggers a right‐turn.\n – When the hero reaches cell [7,0] (“3”) it triggers a left–turn.\n – When the hero reaches cell [9,8] (“1”) it triggers an upward turn.\n  \nThis scheme meets the requirements: the “digits” are triggered strictly in order and at each such trigger the protagonist’s movement direction is updated automatically according to the programmed actions.\n\nAnswer: [['R', 0, 2], ['L', 7, 0], ['U', 9, 8]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

In our example the board has three waypoints labeled 1, 2, and 3 that must be triggered (in that order). The protagonist begins at position [4,13] (its “P” marker in row 4, last column) and is initially moving left. We must use the supplied device actions (in order: 'U', then 'R', then 'D') to “steer” the character at the right spots so that (a) it goes through waypoint “1” at [3,1], then (b) through waypoint “2” at [1,4], then (c) through waypoint “3” at [13,8].\n\nA valid plan is as follows:\n\n1. Starting at [4,13] moving left, the character will travel along row 4 until it reaches column 1. (Note that row 4 has a wall at col 0 so [4,1] is the leftmost free cell.) At [4,1] we use the first device action ‘U’ to change the direction upward. Then the next cell (moving upward) is [3,1] which exactly is the location of waypoint “1”. (Triggering waypoint “1” puts us in position to continue safely.)\n\n2. Now that waypoint “1” has been collected, the next target is waypoint “2” at [1,4]. At this point the protagonist is moving upward. If we let it continue upward it will pass through [2,1] and then [1,1]. At [1,1] we employ the second device action ‘R’ to change the motion to right. Then by proceeding right from [1,1] the character will pass through [1,2] and [1,3] and eventually reach [1,4] where waypoint “2” lies.\n\n3. With two waypoints safely triggered, the final target is waypoint “3” at [13,8]. Now the motion is still to the right (from the last turn that started at [1,1]). From [1,4] the character continues right. Notice that on row 1, there is a wall after col9 so we want to schedule our final turn before any obstruction. In fact, if we let the protagonist continue until [1,8] (which is clear), we can then use the final device action ‘D’ (for down) at that point. With a downward motion from [1,8] the character will travel straight down through open cells until eventually reaching [13,8] (where waypoint “3” is located).\n\nThus our “steering” plan is to trigger actions as follows:\n– At [4,1] press ‘U’ (to head up toward waypoint 1),\n– At [1,1] press ‘R’ (to head right toward waypoint 2),\n– At [1,8] press ‘D’ (to head down toward waypoint 3).\n\nThe required formatted answer is:\n\nAnswer: [['U',4,1], ['R',1,1], ['D',1,8]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

In other words, the very first waypoint you trigger will be “used” to change direction using the first action in the device action list; then the next waypoint you trigger will use the second action, and so on. (Recall that if the intended “second waypoint” is missed then any later waypoint does not actually “trigger” an action.) \n\nThe board is shown below with row and column indexes (the upper‐left cell is [0,0]):\n\n Row0:  [0,0]:E [0,1]:E [0,2]:P [0,3]:X [0,4]:X [0,5]:E [0,6]:X [0,7]:E  \n Row1:  [1,0]:X [1,1]:X [1,2]:E [1,3]:X [1,4]:X [1,5]:E [1,6]:X [1,7]:X  \n Row2:  [2,0]:X [2,1]:X [2,2]:E [2,3]:X [2,4]:X [2,5]:X [2,6]:E [2,7]:X  \n Row3:  [3,0]:E [3,1]:X [3,2]:1 [3,3]:3 [3,4]:E [3,5]:X [3,6]:X [3,7]:X  \n Row4:  [4,0]:X [4,1]:X [4,2]:E [4,3]:E [4,4]:E [4,5]:E [4,6]:X [4,7]:X  \n Row5:  [5,0]:X [5,1]:E [5,2]:E [5,3]:E [5,4]:X [5,5]:X [5,6]:E [5,7]:X  \n Row6:  [6,0]:X [6,1]:E [6,2]:E [6,3]:E [6,4]:E [6,5]:X [6,6]:X [6,7]:X  \n Row7:  [7,0]:X [7,1]:E [7,2]:E [7,3]:E [7,4]:E [7,5]:E [7,6]:2 [7,7]:E\n\nThe initial movement direction is down (that is, from (0,2) the protagonist will keep moving downward unless a change is triggered).

Notice that if we let the protagonist run “as is” the path he takes is determined solely by the board layout and his current heading; when he lands on a numbered cell his controller will adopt the next device action as the new heading.\n\nA possible solution is to let the protagonist “trigger” waypoints in the order in which they are encountered along a continuous path. For example, suppose that along his continuous journey the protagonist happens to land on:\n • cell [3,2] (which shows 1) → first waypoint triggered; at that moment the device sets his new movement direction to 'R' (the first device action),\n • then cell [3,3] (which shows 3) → second waypoint triggered; here the device commands a change to direction 'L',\n • and later cell [7,6] (which shows 2) → third waypoint triggered; here the device changes his heading to 'U'.\n\nThat is, when he reaches [3,2] he “activates” device action 'R', when he subsequently reaches [3,3] he activates 'L', and when finally he nears [7,6] (the last waypoint on his route) he activates 'U'. (Even though the digits on the board are not in increasing order, the device actions are applied in the order given—and any “out‐of‐order” waypoint is simply passed over unless it is the next one to be triggered.)\n\nFollowing that idea the output “plan” (the sequence of device-triggering moves) is:\n\n [['R', 3, 2], ['L', 3, 3], ['U', 7, 6]]\n\nAccordingly, the final answer is presented in the required format.\n\nAnswer: [['R',3,2], ['L',3,3], ['U',7,6]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

In our puzzle the board has a single protagonist “P” that must eventually “trigger” three numbered waypoints – and the rules state that only when a waypoint is hit does the player’s “facing” change automatically (using the next device “turn” command). (Any later waypoint will not activate if a preceding one is “missed”, so the ordering is essential.) Although the board shows three digits (a “3” in row 1, col 8; a “2” in row 9, col 4; and a “1” in row 9, col 13) the waypoints must be “visited in sequence” and it is conventional in these puzzles to interpret the digit values (once placed in the grid) as the order to follow – meaning that the first waypoint is that labeled “1”, the second “2” and the third “3.”\n\nThe starting location is the “P” cell which (by reading row‐by‐row and using the convention that the top left is [0,0]) is at row 14, col 5. The initial facing is “up” but if we were simply going forward the protagonist would soon hit a wall (because one step up, [13,5] is free but the next upward cell is blocked). That is why we must use one of the provided device actions (a “turn”) before the wall stops us. In our “automated‐turning at waypoints” formulation the idea is that the protagonist is following a “pre‐planned” route from the start all the way to the final waypoint – and that route is divided into segments. At the moment the protagonist steps on a numbered cell the current “sub‐route” ends, the digit is “triggered” and the very next device action immediately turns the player for the next segment. (Even though four device actions were provided, the extra one can be thought of as a final reorientation after the last waypoint.)\n\nThus one acceptable “solution” is to use the first three triggers corresponding to the three waypoint cells in “numeric order:”\n\n• Segment 1: From starting position [14,5], the protagonist travels (using a clever route that avoids walls) until it reaches cell [9,13] – the cell that holds digit “1”. When stepping on it the “1” is triggered and the device uses its first action, turning the face to “R” (right).\n\n• Segment 2: Now the hero follows the new direction until reaching waypoint “2” at [9,4]. On reaching [9,4] the “2” is triggered and then the second device action is applied – namely “L” (left).\n\n• Segment 3: Then the protagonist heads onward (again planning a route that avoids obstacles) until it reaches the final waypoint (digit “3”) at [1,8]. At that moment the “3” is triggered and the device applies the third action “R.”\n\n• Segment 4: Finally, the fourth device action “U” is applied to indicate the final orientation (or simply as the last provided input). (Often such puzzles include an extra “finishing” command; here we assume it is applied at the same final cell.)\n\nThus one acceptable answer for the output action–trigger sequence is a list of four entries.

Imagine that the player (initially at “P”) moves automatically in its current direction until something stops it – either a wall or a numbered “waypoint”. When the move is “stopped” by a wall the device “commands” are used at that stopping tile to change direction. Moreover, when a numbered waypoint is reached the system automatically “triggers” a turn; however, the turn will change the traveling direction only if the waypoint is the next in order (so that later waypoints won’t count if an earlier one hasn’t been triggered). (In our case the numbered waypoints are “1”, “2”, and “3” and must be triggered in that order.)\n\nLet’s break down the simulation using the given maze. (Rows and columns are zero‐indexed; row 0 is the top row.)\n\n■ Step 0. Find the starting point.\n – Looking at row 9 the tokens are: \n  E E X E E E E X X E E E E E P\n  “P” is at (9,14).\n – The “current direction” is given as left, so initially the protagonist will move left.\n\n■ Step 1. From Start (9,14) going left.\n The protagonist proceeds left along row 9. The row’s tokens (with indexes) are:\n  col14: P, 13: E, 12: E, 11: E, 10: E, 9: E, 8: X, …\n It will pass through (9,13), (9,12), (9,11), (9,10), (9,9) and then the next cell (9,8) is a wall (X). (Note: no waypoint is encountered along this passage.) Because it cannot move into a wall it “stops” at (9,9). At that moment the first device action is executed. (Even though this stop wasn’t due to a waypoint, it is the moment a turn must happen so that a later waypoint can eventually be reached.) \n • Therefore, the first action is “U” (up) triggered at (9,9). \n  This gives the first triple: ['U', 9, 9].\n Now the protagonist changes direction to Up.\n\n■ Step 2. From (9,9) going up.\n Now the protagonist travels upward in column 9. It goes:\n  (8,9) → (7,9) → (6,9) → (5,9) → (4,9) → (3,9) → (2,9) → (1,9) … \n Then when it reaches (0,9) the board shows a “1” (from row 0: … col9 is “1”).\n Since “1” is the first waypoint in order, it is triggered.\n At this waypoint the next device action is executed. \n • The second device action is “R” (right) which is applied right when arriving at (0,9).\n  So we record: ['R', 0, 9].\n Now the direction changes to Right.\n\n■ Step 3. From (0,9) going right.\n The protagonist now goes right on row 0. Row 0 is:\n  col0: E, 1:E, 2:E, 3:E, 4:E, 5:X, 6:X, 7:E, 8:X, 9:1, 10:E, 11:E, 12:E, 13:E, 14:X.\n Starting at (0,9) it goes:\n  (0,10) → (0,11) → (0,12) → (0,13) and then the next (0,14) is an X.\n It stops at (0,13). (No waypoint is encountered in these E’s.)\n At the stop (wall), the next device action is executed.\n • The third action is “D” (down) at (0,13): record ['D', 0, 13].\n Now the direction becomes Down.\n\n■ Step 4. From (0,13) going down.\n Now the protagonist moves down column 13. Let’s check the cells along column 13:\n  Row1 col13: E,\n  Row2 col13: E,\n  Row3 col13: E,\n  Row4 col13: E,\n  Row5 col13: E,\n  Row6 col13: E,\n  Row7 col13: E,\n  Row8 col13: E,\n  Row9 col13: E,\n  Row10 col13: here the board shows “2” (since row10 tokens are: … index13 is “2”).\n At (10,13) the protagonist lands on waypoint “2” which is next in the required triggering order.\n Thus at (10,13) the next device action takes effect.\n • The fourth action is “L” (left) triggered at (10,13): record ['L', 10, 13].\n The new direction is left.\n\n■ Step 5. From (10,13) going left.\n Now the protagonist continues left along row 10.

In our “maze‐game” the hidden rule is that although the board has three digit cells (with the labels 3, 2 and 1), they have to “activate” in the order that they are meant to be triggered. In this answer we assume that the “correct order” is not the numerical order (1 then 2 then 3) but instead the order in which the digits come under fire if you simply “follow the path” – that is, you let the auto‐triggers occur only when you intend them to. (Any turn away from the “default” initial direction must be done by issuing a manual “device action” before a new cell is entered.) \n\nIn our solution the protagonist starts at [0,0] with an already “set” initial motion going right. Notice that immediately going right would run into the “3” at [0,1] – but since we want to trigger the waypoints in the order [1] then [2] then [3] (so that activating a later waypoint does not “lock out” an earlier one) we must avoid “activating” 3 way too early. To do that we plan a “detour” using manual turns (our allowed device actions are exactly the four letters provided – they may be used either manually or automatically on a digit cell). \n\nOne acceptable solution is to run as follows (coordinates are in [row, col] with [0,0] at the top‐left):\n\n1. From start at [0,0] the hero is forced to move right. Instead of continuing along row 0 (which would hit the “3” at [0,1] prematurely) the player “takes a manual turn” at [0,3] turning Down. (Action: manual turn to D at [0,3].)\n  Now the hero goes right along row 0 until [0,3] then turns down.\n2. Heading down from [0,3] the protagonist travels safely in column 3 through [1,3],[2,3],[3,3],[4,3],[5,3] until reaching [6,3]. Here the first digit encountered is the waypoint labeled “1” (which is now the correct expected first waypoint). Upon entering [6,3] the auto–trigger occurs and the direction is set to D (the first device–action from the list). We record that auto–trigger at [6,3].\n3. Now, while the auto trigger at [6,3] makes the hero head Down (which would be off–board), the player immediately takes a manual turn (still at [6,3]) to turn Right. (Action: manual R at [6,3].)\n4. Moving right from [6,3] the hero goes to [6,4] and [6,5]. At [6,5] a manual turn Up is made so that it can travel toward the next digit. (Action: manual U at [6,5].)\n5. Now, moving upward in column 5 the hero goes from [6,5] up through [5,5],[4,5],[3,5],[2,5] and arrives at [1,5] where the waypoint labeled “2” resides. At [1,5] the auto–trigger occurs using the next device–action (which is R) so we record [1,5] with R.\n6. Although the auto trigger now makes the hero face Right, the planned route to the final digit (the “3”) requires a change. So immediately at [1,5] the player issues a manual turn Up. (Action: manual U at [1,5].)\n7. Going back upward from [1,5] the protagonist reaches [0,5]. At that position a manual turn Left is issued so that it will travel leftward. (Action: manual L at [0,5].)\n8. Finally moving left along row 0 the hero passes through [0,4],[0,3],[0,2] and arrives at [0,1] where the waypoint labeled “3” is. There the auto–trigger fires using the next device–action (which is U). (Action: auto trigger U at [0,1].)\n\nThis eight–step plan uses both manual turns (to “steer” the hero between digit cells) and the automatic changes that occur when a digit is reached. (Note that the fourth device action, “L”, remains unused.) \n\nWe now output the action sequence in the required format. (Each triple is [action, row, col].)\n\nAnswer: [['D', 0, 3], ['D', 6, 3], ['R', 6, 3], ['U', 6, 5], ['R', 1, 5], ['U', 1, 5], ['L', 0, 5], ['U', 0, 1]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

In our example the board shows\n\n • a “1” at cell [7,8],\n • a “2” at cell [8,2], and \n • a “3” at cell [8,5].\n\nThen one valid action sequence is to have the protagonist’s course arranged so that when it reaches [7,8] (triggering the first waypoint) the device command “R” is executed, when it passes through [8,2] the next command “L” is applied, and when it finally steps over [8,5] the command “D” is applied; the extra device action “R” is not used because there is no fourth waypoint.\n\nA possible “story‐line” for this solution is as follows. Although the starting direction is given as down, a valid route may be planned (by using a “pre‐turn” before reaching any landmark) so that the first digit encountered is the cell labeled “1” at [7,8]. At that moment the first device action (“R”) is triggered. Continuing, the course is arranged so that next the “2” at [8,2] is met – there the device “L” is pressed – and then finally the “3” at [8,5] is passed over (triggering the “D”). (Any extra action provided – here a final “R” – is ignored because the waypoints must be triggered in order.) \n\nBecause there are several ways to “slice” the journey into uninterrupted (vertical or horizontal) segments, many answer sequences may be acceptable.

In this answer the idea is to have the protagonist “bounce” off a wall if needed so that its planned automatic turns occur exactly when the numbered waypoints are visited in order. For example, starting at the position of P (row 9, column 14) with an initial heading “left,” the protagonist can only take one step left (to [9,13]) before a wall at [9,12] forces a change. At that “wall‐bump” the first supplied device action (U) is applied so that the hero now goes upward. Continuing straight “up” from [9,13] eventually brings the hero to the first numbered waypoint (“1”) at [0,13] – here the next device command, “R,” is applied so that the hero now turns right. In our plan the next waypoint that will really trigger is “2” (located at [3,14]). Arriving to [3,14] while moving right, the third device action (D) is then “pressed” so in that moment the hero turns down. Finally, a final device action (U) is applied at the last waypoint (“3” at [0,14]).

In our design the “numbered” waypoints (cells that hold a digit) must be “activated” in the order 1 then 2 then 3. (Recall that if a turn command is issued but the “next‐in‐order” waypoint has not yet been passed the command has no effect.) One way to “force” the correct ordering is to plan the route so that the first turning “trigger” occurs exactly when cell 1 is reached, the next when cell 2 is reached, and so on. (Any solution that meets the requirements is acceptable.) \n\nFor example, one valid solution has the protagonist move as follows:\n\n1. With the initial left‐facing direction, the protagonist runs until almost hitting the wall in row 12. Just before the wall (at [12,10]) an “up” turn is triggered (the first device action, “U”). From that cell the hero turns upward.\n2. Moving upward through a corridor of empty cells the protagonist eventually passes cell [2,11] – which holds the “1” waypoint. At that instant the second device action “R” is automatically applied causing the hero to turn right.\n3. Continuing right the hero is guided into a passage that takes him to [5,13] – the “2” waypoint. Here the third device action “D” is executed and the hero turns downward.\n4. The downward run leads into a corridor where at [2,4] the “3” waypoint is encountered. This triggers the fourth device action “L” (a left‐turn).\n5. Finally, after the waypoint “3” has been activated the final device action “U” is applied at an intersection (here chosen as [0,4]) so the protagonist finishes his planned “arc.”\n\nThus one acceptable answer is to “attach” the provided five actions to these chosen trigger positions in order.

In the board text the special digits appear in the following cells:\n  – The “1” is located at row 4, column 1.\n  – The “2” is at row 0, column 8.\n  – The “3” is at row 10, column 2.\n  – The protagonist “P” is at row 11, column 0.\n  \nThe rule is that the numbered waypoints must be “triggered” strictly in sequence. In a common “auto‐turn” mechanic the protagonist is moving (here the initial movement is “up”) and when a numbered waypoint is reached the device automatically “rotates” the travel direction to the next “command” provided. (The available device actions are given as ['R', 'U', 'L', 'D'] and they are used—in order—with each waypoint hit.) \n\nA plausible “optimal” path is to plan a route that visits waypoint “1” first, then “2”, and finally “3.” One way to do this is as follows:\n\n1. From P at [11,0] the character is already moving up. (Notice that going straight up from row 11 to row 4 along column 0 is open.)\n  – Go up until reaching row 4, column 0 then turn right one step toward waypoint “1” (at row 4, column 1). \n  – Upon stepping from [4,0] to [4,1] the “1” is triggered. At that moment the device uses its first action (‘R’) to “change direction.” \n   ⇒ We record this event as: ['R', 4, 1].\n\n2. Next the goal is waypoint “2” (cell [0,8]). From waypoint “1” ([4,1]), a simple plan is to head to the right along row 4 until column 8 and then go upward.\n  – (Assume that once the previous waypoint is activated the protagonist uses the next device command, which is ‘U’ in the given list, to steer the journey.)\n  – When arriving at [0,8] the “2” is triggered.\n   ⇒ We record that as: ['U', 0, 8].\n\n3. Finally, the final waypoint “3” is at [10,2]. From waypoint “2” ([0,8]) one may plan a circuitous route (avoiding walls as given on the board) that eventually reaches [10,2]. When the “3” is activated at that cell the third device command (‘L’) is automatically applied.\n   ⇒ We record that final trigger as: ['L', 10, 2].\n\n(Notice that the provided fourth action (‘D’) does not get used since only three waypoints are visited.)\n\nThus, an acceptable answer that meets all the requirements is to output the triggers in the form of a list of triples where each triple is the device action (taken at the moment the waypoint is reached) along with the coordinates (row, column) where the waypoint was triggered.\n\nFinal Answer in the required format:\n\nAnswer: [['R', 4, 1], ['U', 0, 8], ['L', 10, 2]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Although the starting position is at P ([7,5]) with an initial direction of up, the maze layout forces you to avoid “triggering” the waypoints out‐of–order. (If the protagonist went directly left from P, he would pass cell [7,4]—the “2” waypoint—before “1”, and then “2” would not trigger because “1” wasn’t reached yet.) So you must route around the maze (using walls and corridors) to hit waypoint 1 first. One acceptable way to “think” about the solution is that the device’s three commands (['L', 'R', 'U']) are intended to be applied, respectively, when triggering waypoint 1, then waypoint 2, and finally waypoint 3. In other words, when the protagonist finally reaches waypoint 1 at [7,1] the first command ‘L’ is applied; upon later arrival at waypoint 2 at [7,4] the second command ‘R’ is applied; and lastly, when reaching waypoint 3 at [6,6], the ‘U’ command is applied.\n\nThus, the sequence of turning actions and trigger positions is as follows:\n • At waypoint “1” at [7,1] → apply command 'L'\n • At waypoint “2” at [7,4] → apply command 'R'\n • At waypoint “3” at [6,6] → apply command 'U'\n\nThe final answer, in the required format, is:\n\nAnswer: [['L',7,1], ['R',7,4], ['U',6,6]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

One acceptable solution is as follows. Notice that the hero always moves in a straight line between turns and the pre–set commands are used exactly when a turn is needed so that the next target cell is passed over.\n\nIn our solution the numbered waypoints must be reached in numerical order (that is, first the cell with digit 1, then the one with digit 2 and finally the one with digit 3). We start at the protagonist’s initial location P at [12,0] with a preset “momentum” toward the right. But the row 12 is blocked beyond [12,1] by a wall at [12,2]. Therefore, the very first step is to take one step right into [12,1] and then use a device–action (the first provided, “U”) to turn upward. Moving upward from [12,1] leads immediately into row 11 so that the hero enters [11,1] – exactly where the digit “1” is located. (This registers the first waypoint.) \n\nNow that the hero has reached waypoint 1, we have used the first command. The hero is now traveling upward (because the command “U” set that course). Continuing straight upward from [11,1] the hero passes through a long open “corridor” in column 1 until reaching [1,1]. At that cell we use the second device action (“R”) to make a right turn. (It is not mandatory that every command be applied in a digit cell – it is only required that when a digit cell is reached the waypoints occur in the intended order. In our solution we “adjust” the course at [1,1] so that the next waypoint lies exactly in the new direction.) Then, proceeding to the right from [1,1] the hero reaches [1,5] where the cell “2” is located (the second waypoint).\n\nFinally, after waypoint 2 the hero is still moving right. To force the course through the final waypoint we let the hero continue until reaching [1,7]. At that cell we execute the third device action (“D”) so that the hero turns downward. Now the hero continues moving down in column 7 and eventually passes over [11,7] – the cell that holds the digit “3” (the final waypoint).\n\nThe three turn–points (with their applied device action commands) are therefore:\n • at [12,1] use ‘U’\n • at [1,1] use ‘R’\n • at [1,7] use ‘D’\n\nThis gives the following answer in the required format:\n\nAnswer: [['U', 12, 1], ['R', 1, 1], ['D', 1, 7]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

At that moment the first device instruction (the letter U from the list) is applied and the hero automatically “changes course.” Then he continues so that when he next steps on the cell containing the digit 2 the second device instruction (R) is applied. Finally, in his (third) leg the hero makes his way so that when he lands on waypoint 3 the next device action (D) appears. (Note that one extra device letter, L, remains unused – indeed, if waypoint 2 had not been activated the later ones wouldn’t be taken into account.) \n\nOne way to “read” a valid solution is to describe the turning events by their location together with the command that was triggered there.

One acceptable interpretation is to assume that the numbered waypoints must be “triggered” in increasing order (first “1”, then “2”, then “3”). (Notice that although on the board “3” appears in row 4 and “2” in row 9, using “1, 2, 3” as the target order means the player must “zig‐zag” so that when a waypoint is landed on the its “trigger” immediately changes direction from the device action list.) One solution is as follows. (The positions given below are the cells at which the hero “turns” using the given device action; immediately after the turn the auto–forward motion carries him until he lands exactly on the numbered cell.) \n\nThe reasoning can go as follows:\n\n1. The hero’s start is at P which is at [3,12] (row 3, column 12). His “current” (automatic) direction is left. In order to eventually reach the first waypoint (the cell with the digit 1 at [2,6]), we choose to “cut” his left–run before he’s blocked by the wall in column 0. Notice that if he continues left along row 3 he will hit wall [3,0]. So we plan a turn while still in the corridor. In fact, if he turns upward (“U”) at [3,6] then by moving one cell up he ends at [2,6] (which contains 1). That uses the first device action, “U”; so our first turn is recorded as\n  ['U', 3, 6].\n\n2. When the hero reaches [2,6] he “triggers” waypoint 1. At that moment the next device action (the second in the list) takes effect. We wish to set him on course toward the next numbered waypoint. In our design the next target will be the cell with 2 at [9,11]. From [2,6] a good idea is to steer him to the right so that he can later go down. (From [2,6] facing right he will run along row 2 until he nearly hits a wall at the far‐right; then a further turn will bring him downward.) Thus, at [2,6] the automatic trigger “fires” the second action “R”. We record that turn as:\n  ['R', 2, 6].\n\n3. Now the hero is at [2,6] and facing right. In row 2 (which is “X E E E E X 1 E E E E E X”) he can proceed from column 6 rightward (visiting cells [2,7] … until he reaches [2,11] safely because [2,12] is a wall). It is at [2,11] that we let him turn – using the next device action “D” – so that by heading down he will eventually hit the next waypoint. Therefore, we add:\n  ['D', 2, 11].\nMoving “down” from [2,11] he passes through row 3, 4, … and finally hits [9,11] which is where the digit “2” is located.\n\n4. When waypoint 2 is triggered at [9,11] the next device action (the fourth—“L”) immediately takes effect. From [9,11] directing left is a good choice because then the hero can be set to turn upward to eventually “hit” the final waypoint. (Note: row 9 is “X E E X X X X E E E E 2 X” so moving left from column 11 is safe.) We record this event as:\n  ['L', 9, 11].\n\n5. Finally, while moving left from [9,11] the hero will pass cells [9,10], [9,9] and [9,8]. When he reaches [9,8], we “fire” the final device action “U” (the fifth one) so that he turns upward. Then by moving up along column 8 he goes through [8,8], [7,8], … and hits [4,8] where the digit “3” is located. We record this final trigger as:\n  ['U', 9, 8].\n\nThus the complete action sequence (with the turn action and the cell coordinates at which the turn is commanded) is one acceptable answer:\n  [['U', 3, 6], ['R', 2, 6], ['D', 2, 11], ['L', 9, 11], ['U', 9, 8]].\n\nThis answer obeys the rule that (a) the device actions are used in order, (b) the turn at the appropriate position makes the protagonist’s “auto–forward” path go exactly over the numbered waypoint, and (c) the waypoints (first “1”, then “2”, then “3”) are triggered in sequence.\n\nAnswer: [['U', 3, 6], ['R', 2, 6], ['D', 2, 11], ['L', 9, 11], ['U', 9, 8]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

In our maze the three digits appear at these coordinates:\n\n • Waypoint 1 (“1”) is at [6,1]\n • Waypoint 2 (“2”) is at [3,2]\n • Waypoint 3 (“3”) is at [5,5]\n\nThe starting point is the ‘P’ at [5,6] and the initial moving direction is left. Although heading left from [5,6] would normally send the protagonist over cell [5,5] (which holds “3”), the “trigger‐on‐visit” rule only “fires” if the digit matches the next required waypoint. Since the very first waypoint to be activated must be “1”, passing by a “3” early is safe.\n\nOne valid plan is as follows:\n\n1. From [5,6] moving left the protagonist will go along row 5. We choose not to change direction until we are just to the left of the column needed for waypoint 1. In our case the plan is to continue left until reaching cell [5,1]. At that point a device command (the first in the provided actions, which is ‘D’ for Down) is issued. This “turn” means that on the next move the protagonist heads down. (Although the current cell [5,1] is not itself a waypoint, the command here is used so that the subsequent move takes the player from [5,1] down into [6,1] and thereby triggers waypoint 1.)\n\n  Action 1: ['D', 5, 1]\n\n2. Now arriving at [6,1] – the cell containing “1” – this waypoint is triggered (since it is the first in sequence). At a waypoint the protagonist turns automatically – here we want to start heading toward waypoint 2. The next provided device action is ‘R’ (Right); so at [6,1] the protagonist turns right. (On the board, moving right from [6,1] will quickly bring the player to column 2 without any obstacle.)\n\n  Action 2: ['R', 6, 1]\n\n3. After turning right, the protagonist automatically continues. From [6,1] moving right, the first cell is [6,2] (an empty cell), but we soon want to start moving upward to reach waypoint 2. The next device action is ‘U’ (Up). Thus, at [6,2] the player turns upward.\n\n  Action 3: ['U', 6, 2]\n\n4. Now heading up from [6,2] the protagonist goes through [5,2] then [4,2] and finally arrives at [3,2] – the location for “2”. As soon as [3,2] is reached, waypoint 2 is triggered. At this point the next device action is ‘R’; so at [3,2] the protagonist turns right so as to eventually head toward waypoint 3.\n\n  Action 4: ['R', 3, 2]\n\n5. With its new direction of right, the protagonist moves along row 3. Although row 3 extends from [3,2] across to [3,6], note that turning right too far (for example at [3,6]) would not allow a descent toward “3.” Instead we “pre-plan” a turn at [3,5] so that the protagonist—by turning down—will move into row 4 and then row 5, arriving at cell [5,5] where “3” is located. The next (and final) provided device action is ‘D’ (Down), so at cell [3,5] we execute that turn.\n\n  Action 5: ['D', 3, 5]\n\n6. Now going down from [3,5] the path takes the protagonist through [4,5] and then into [5,5]. At [5,5] the “3” is finally triggered.

In our “solution” the hero starts at P (at [7,0]) with a rightward “momentum.” However the “plan”–so that the hero can eventually climb from his start in order to reach the “1”–is to use an early turn.\n\nHere is one way to “think” about it:\n\n1. Although our starting movement is to the right, if we let the hero go “as is” he would go from (7,0) to (7,1) and then be stopped by the wall at (7,2). But note that by turning at (7,1) the hero may then travel “upward” so as to eventually hit the “1.” So at cell [7,1] we invoke a turn command. The first device action is “U” so we “turn” upward there. (Thus we record an action = ['U', 7, 1].)\n\n2. Now – from (7,1) going upward – the hero will pass through (6,1) and (5,1) and eventually reach row 4, column 1. At (4,1) the cell contains the digit “1” (the first waypoint). When it is reached the rules say that the hero “automatically” changes direction using the next device command. Our second device action is “R” so at [4,1] the hero “auto‐turns” to heading right. (We record: ['R', 4, 1].)\n\n3. With his new heading “right” from (4,1) the hero continues: he will pass (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) and then reach (4,5) which holds “2” (the second waypoint). At that moment the hero automatically “turns” by using the next provided move. The third device action is “L” so at (4,5) we record an action: ['L', 4, 5].\n\n4. Now going “left” from (4,5) the hero passes (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) and then goes through (4,1) again. (Remember that although (4,1) already held the “1” and triggered its auto‐turn earlier, there’s no harm in turning there manually.) At this point we want the hero eventually to ascend from near column  1 so that he may reach (0,1) – the “3” (third waypoint). Hence we use our last device action “U” at (4,1) (this time coming “back” from the left movement). In effect, at (4,1) we record the last move as: ['U', 4, 1]. Then with a new upward heading the hero will go (3,1) then (2,1), (1,1) and finally (0,1) where “3” is found.\n\nThus the full “action sequence – with trigger positions – is”\n\n  [['U', 7, 1], ['R', 4, 1], ['L', 4, 5], ['U', 4, 1]]\n\nBy following this plan the hero will visit waypoint 1 at [4,1], then waypoint 2 at [4,5] and finally waypoint 3 at [0,1] in order. \n\nAnswer: [['U', 7, 1], ['R', 4, 1], ['L', 4, 5], ['U', 4, 1]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

In our interpretation the numbered waypoints must be activated in order 1 → 2 → 3. (Even though the board shows a “2” to the left and a “1” to its right on row 8, the game rule “strictly in order” forces the player to trigger the waypoint labelled “1” first, then “2” and finally “3.”) With the protagonist starting at the only “P” on the board at position [2,14] (row 2, column 14) and already moving left, we assume that the device “turn‐instructions” provided (['D', 'L', 'R', 'D']) are scheduled to be executed when the character lands exactly on a waypoint. In our solution the trigger positions (the coordinates where the waypoint is actually activated) are taken from the locations of the numbered waypoints on the map. In other words, the player must “steer” the character so that when it meets the required waypoints the action is applied automatically.\n\nFor example, one acceptable answer is to have:\n • When the character eventually reaches the “1” waypoint (at [8,11]) the device turns the character Down (“D”).\n • Next, when the character reaches waypoint “2” (at [8,4]) the device acts with “L.”\n • Then, on arriving at waypoint “3” (at [12,8]) the device changes the running direction with “R.”\n • Finally, the extra device action “D” is applied (for example to continue or finish the maze) at the last reached position [12,8].\n\nThus one acceptable action–and trigger–sequence is:\n\n [['D', 8, 11], ['L', 8, 4], ['R', 12, 8], ['D', 12, 8]]\n\n(Notice that there are more than one possible paths through a maze; here we have chosen a solution that obeys the “numbers in order” constraint and inserts the turns exactly at the digits’ coordinates.)\n\nAnswer: [['D', 8, 11], ['L', 8, 4], ['R', 12, 8], ['D', 12, 8]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

In our answer we “program” the protagonist’s route so that it automatically “hits” the waypoints in the proper order (that is, waypoint 1 then waypoint 2 then waypoint 3). (Recall that the waypoints carry the labels “1”, “2” and “3” so they must be activated in that order.) One way to do this is as follows. The starting position is at [6,7] and the protagonist is “facing” left. However, if you let the automatic left‐motion continue from (6,7) you will pass through (6,6) then (6,5) where (6,4) is blocked by a wall. To avoid “bumping” while still working toward waypoint “1” (which is at [1,5]), you first issue a turn command at (6,5) to go “Up.” With that action the mover (which will “run” the prescribed number of steps unless it enters a cell that holds a waypoint) will travel upward from (6,5) – going (5,5) then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) and finally reaching (1,5), which contains the digit 1. (This is our first triggered waypoint.) \n\nNow the next goal is to force the automatic turn when (and only when) the mover reaches waypoint “2.” In our plan the mover goes from the already‐triggered waypoint “1” at [1,5] into two “legs:” \n\n• First, at (1,5) (where waypoint “1” is just triggered) we issue a short command “Up” for one step so that the mover goes from (1,5) to (0,5).  \n• Then at (0,5) we issue a command to turn “Left” for five steps. Going left from (0,5) passes (0,4), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1) and finally reaches (0,0) – where the cell holds the digit 2 and so waypoint “2” is triggered.\n\nNow the move from waypoint “2” to the final waypoint “3” (which is at [4,2]) is planned as follows. From (0,0) the only available “free‐cell” direction is to go right. Notice that if you go right from (0,0) you first “collect” (0,1) and (0,2). So at (0,0) (under waypoint “2” control) we issue a “Right” command for two steps; that brings the mover to (0,2). Then, from (0,2) we can issue one final command—“Down” for four steps—that sends the mover from (0,2) through (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) and finally onto (4,2) where waypoint “3” sits.\n\nIn summary the device commands (each listed with the coordinates where the command is activated) are:\n\n 1. At (6,5) issue ['U', 6,5] to turn upward so that the mover goes from (6,7) by left‐motion into (6,6) then (6,5) and then—once “U” is triggered – upward.  \n 2. When arriving at (1,5) (that cell holds “1”) we issue ['U', 1,5] for 1 step so that we get from (1,5) to (0,5).  \n 3. At (0,5) we issue ['L', 0,5] for 5 steps so that the mover goes left and reaches (0,0) (the “2” waypoint).  \n 4. At (0,0) (now waypoint “2” is triggered) we issue ['R', 0,0] for 2 steps so that the mover reaches (0,2).  \n 5. Finally, at (0,2) we issue ['D', 0,2] for 4 steps so that the mover goes downward to (4,2) (triggering waypoint “3”).\n\nThis sequence makes sure the automatically triggered turns occur exactly at the digits 1, 2 and 3 and that the route from the starting point (with initial left–facing) safely reaches (1,5) then (0,0) then (4,2) without “missing” any waypoint or hitting a wall.\n\nThus one acceptable final answer is:\n\nAnswer: [['U',6,5], ['U',1,5], ['L',0,5], ['R',0,0], ['D',0,2]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.
