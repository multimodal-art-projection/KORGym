You are provided with an initial player movement direction ('up\/down\/left\/right') and a series of player actions ('U\/D\/L\/R') along with their respective counts. The player needs to produce an action sequence such that the protagonist changes direction automatically when reaching each waypoint, ensuring that waypoints are visited sequentially. The action sequence must trigger the waypoints strictly in order; if the second waypoint isn't triggered, subsequent waypoints will not be triggered even if visited.The coordinates in the top left corner are [0,0].\n\nPlease output the sequence of actions and corresponding trigger positions in the following format:\n'Answer: [['R',3,2], ['U',0,2], ...]'\nMaze Board:\n2 E E E E E X E\nX E E X E 1 E E\nX E E X E E E X\nX X E E X E X X\nX X 3 X X E X E\nX E X X X E X X\nE X X E X E E P\nE X X X E E X X\n\nCurrent Direction:left\nDevice Actions:['U', 'L', 'R', 'D']\n","epoch":1,"n":8,"seed":49,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
