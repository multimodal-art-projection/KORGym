The protagonist ('P') must traverse the maze following the given movement pattern while visiting the waypoints (`1`, `2`, and `3`) **in order**.\n2. Upon reaching a waypoint, a direction change is triggered automatically.\n3. The action sequence must be output in the format `[['Direction', steps, waypoint_reached]]`, and waypoints can only be triggered if they are visited in numerical order.\n\n---\n\n### **Analyzing the Maze and Input:**\nThe starting position of the protagonist ('P') is `(0, 4)`.  \nThe initial player direction is **down**.  \nThe waypoints in the maze need to be visited in the order: `1 → 2 → 3`.\n\n---\n\n### **Steps to Solve the Problem:**\n\n1. Identify the coordinates of the waypoints:\n   - Waypoint `1` is at `(10, 10)`.\n   - Waypoint `2` is at `(13, 14)`.\n   - Waypoint `3` is at `(1, 13)`.\n\n2. Plan the path to sequentially visit the waypoints `1 → 2 → 3` while respecting maze constraints (`E`=empty, `X`=wall).\n\n3. Translate this path into action sequences while ensuring the protagonist reaches each waypoint, and automatically changes direction upon triggering each one.\n\n---\n\n### **Action Sequence Generation:**\n\n#### **Step 1: Move to `1` (from `(0, 4)` to `(10, 10)`):**\n- Starting direction: **down**.\n- Follow this path:\n  1. Move **down** 10 steps to `(10, 4)`: `['D', 10, 0]`.\n  2.

Move **down** 3 steps to `(13, 10)`: `['D', 3, 0]`.\n  2. Move **right** 4 steps to `(13, 14)` (Waypoint `2`): `['R', 4, 2]`.\n\n#### **Step 3: Move to `3` (from `(13, 14)` to `(1, 13)`):**\n- Starting direction (after triggering waypoint `2`): **right**.\n- Follow this path:\n  1. Move **up** 12 steps to `(1, 14)`: `['U', 12, 0]`.\n  2.

Indexes are 0-based.\n  - Waypoint 1 is at (0, 9).\n  - Waypoint 2 is at (10, 13).\n  - Waypoint 3 is at (3, 1).\n\n- **Current Direction:** The starting direction is \"left.\"\n\n- **Device Actions:** ['U', 'R', 'D', 'L', 'U'].

From the initial position `(9, 13)` (P), move toward waypoint `2` at `(10, 13)`.  \n   **Reasoning:** We prioritize the nearest waypoint.

We'll navigate carefully to reach waypoint 3.\n\n3.

Let's break this problem into steps:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the maze to locate the protagonist and waypoints.\nThe maze has the protagonist ('P') at position **(12, 13)** (row 12, column 13, considering the maze is 0-indexed). The waypoints are located as follows:\n- Waypoint '1' is at position **(2, 11)**.\n- Waypoint '2' is at position **(5, 13)**.\n- Waypoint '3' is at position **(2, 4)**.\n\nThe initial direction of the protagonist is **left**, and the player has the ability to issue actions to guide the protagonist through the maze.\n\n### Step 2: Interpret the movement mechanics.\nThe player provides a series of actions indicating movement directions:\n- 'U' for up.\n- 'R' for right.\n- 'D' for down.\n- 'L' for left.\n\nThe count of these actions is determined based on the protagonist's ability to traverse empty spaces ('E') while avoiding walls ('X').\n\n### Step 3: Plan a path to visit waypoints.\nThe protagonist must sequentially visit the waypoints (1 → 2 → 3), and their direction must automatically change after triggering each waypoint. To determine the correct sequence of movements, a step-by-step path planning process will be employed.\n\n---\n\n#### Path from (12, 13) to (2, 11) (Waypoint '1'):\n1. Move **up** to reach row 2. Moving directly up in a straight line avoids all walls:\n   - Perform 'U' 10 times to move from (12, 13) to (2, 13).\n2. Move **left** to reach column 11:\n   - Perform 'L' 2 times to move from (2, 13) to (2, 11).\n3. Trigger waypoint '1'. Change direction for the next path.\n\n---\n\n#### Path from (2, 11) to (5, 13) (Waypoint '2'):\n1. Move **right** to reach column 13:\n   - Perform 'R' 2 times to move from (2, 11) to (2, 13).\n2. Move **down** to reach row 5:\n   - Perform 'D' 3 times to move from (2, 13) to (5, 13).\n3. Trigger waypoint '2'. Change direction for the next path.\n\n---\n\n#### Path from (5, 13) to (2, 4) (Waypoint '3'):\n1. Move **left** to reach column 4:\n   - Perform 'L' 9 times to move from (5, 13) to (5, 4).\n2. Move **up** to reach row 2:\n   - Perform 'U' 3 times to move from (5, 4) to (2, 4).\n3. Trigger waypoint '3'.

The player needs to produce an action sequence such that the protagonist changes direction automatically when reaching each waypoint, ensuring that waypoints are visited sequentially. The action sequence must trigger the waypoints strictly in order; if the second waypoint isn't triggered, subsequent waypoints will not be triggered even if visited.\n\nPlease output the sequence of actions and corresponding trigger positions in the following format:\n'Answer: [['R',3,2], ['U',0,2], ...]'\nMaze Board:\nE X E X X E X E X X E E E E X\nE E X E E E X E X X X E E X E\nX X X E E E E X E E E E E E P\nE X E X X X X X E X X E X X E\nX E X X X X E E E X X E X X X\nX E X X X X X E E E E E X E E\nX X X X E X X X E X X E X X E\nE E X X E E E X X E E E X E X\nX E X X 2 E E E E E E 1 X E E\nE X X X X E X E E X E E X X E\nX E E X X X X X E X X E E X E\nE E E X E X E X E X X E X X X\nX X X E X X E E 3 E E X E E X\nX E X X X E X X X X E E X E X\nX X X X E X X E X X X X X X E\n\nCurrent Direction:left\nDevice Actions:['D', 'L', 'R', 'D']\n","epoch":1,"n":15,"detail":[{"type":"list_type","loc":["body","action"],"msg":"Input should be a valid list","input":"[]'"}],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The player must navigate the maze based on the provided set of moves (`'R', 'L', 'U', 'R', 'D'`) and must visit the waypoints `'1'`, `'2'`, and `'3'` in order. The initial direction is `'up'`.\n\n#### Step-by-step plan:\n1. **Locate the protagonist `'P'` and the coordinates of all waypoints (`'1', '2', '3'`)** in the maze:\n   - `'P'` is at `(14, 5)`.\n   - `'1'` is at `(6, 14)`, `'2'` is at `(1, 5)`, `'3'` is at `(12, 8)`.\n\n2. **Implement movement**:\n   - Move according to the sequence `['R', 'L', 'U', 'R', 'D']`.\n   - Check every move to see if the player reaches a waypoint.\n   - Adjust directions immediately when a waypoint is triggered.\n\n3. **Trigger waypoints strictly in order (1 → 2 → 3)**:\n   - Waypoints will only be triggered if reached in order. For example, `'2'` can only be triggered after `'1'`.\n\n4. **Output the sequence of triggered waypoints along with their actions and positions**, formatted as `[['DIRECTION', ROW, COLUMN], ...]`.\n\n---\n\n### **Implementation**\n\n#### 1. Key Definitions\n- **Maze dimensions**: 15 × 15.\n- **Player’s actions**: Each action (`'R'`, `'L'`, `'U'`, `'D'`) moves the player by 1 step in the specified direction unless the movement is blocked by a wall `'X'`.\n  - `'R'` (right): `(row, col + 1)`\n  - `'L'` (left): `(row, col - 1)`\n  - `'U'` (up): `(row - 1, col)`\n  - `'D'` (down): `(row + 1, col)`\n\n---\n\n#### 2.
