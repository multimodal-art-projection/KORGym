From the maze, the position of 'P' is at `[8, 8]`.\n- The current direction is `up`.\n- The device actions are `['L', 'R', 'U', 'L', 'D']`.\n- The waypoints are numbered `1`, `2`, `3` and need to be visited in this order.\n\n### Step 2: Movement and Waypoint Detection\n- We start moving according to the device actions. When we move, we check if we hit a wall ('X') or a waypoint. If we hit a wall, we stop moving in that direction. If we hit a waypoint, we change the direction according to the next device action and continue moving from the waypoint position.\n\nLet's start the simulation:\n- First, we need to move the protagonist in the `up` direction until we either hit a wall or a waypoint.\n- Moving up from `[8, 8]`, we reach `[7, 8]` (empty space 'E'). Continuing up, we reach `[6, 8]` (empty space 'E'). Moving up further, we reach `[5, 8]` which is a wall 'X'. So, we stop moving up.\n\nNow, we follow the device actions. The first action is `L` (left).\n- Changing direction to left and moving from `[6, 8]`, we reach `[6, 7]` (empty space 'E'), then `[6, 6]` (empty space 'E'), then `[6, 5]` (empty space 'E'), then `[6, 4]` (wall 'X'). So, we stop moving left.\n\nThe second action is `R` (right).\n- Changing direction to right and moving from `[6, 4]`, we reach `[6, 5]` (empty space 'E'), then `[6, 6]` (empty space 'E'), then `[6, 7]` (empty space 'E'), then `[6, 8]` (empty space 'E').\n\nThe third action is `U` (up).\n- Changing direction to up and moving from `[6, 8]`, we reach `[5, 8]` (wall 'X').\n\nThe fourth action is `L` (left).\n- Changing direction to left and moving from `[6, 8]`, we reach `[6, 7]` (empty space 'E'), then `[6, 6]` (empty space 'E'), then `[6, 5]` (empty space 'E'), then `[6, 4]` (wall 'X').\n\nThe fifth action is `D` (down).\n- Changing direction to down and moving from `[6, 4]`, we reach `[7, 4]` (empty space 'E'), then `[8, 4]` (wall 'X').\n\nLet's start over and find the correct sequence:\n- Starting from `[8, 8]` with direction `up`, moving up to `[7, 8]`, then `[6, 8]`.\n- First action `L`: moving left from `[6, 8]` to `[6, 7]`, `[6, 6]`, `[6, 5]`, `[6, 4]` (wall).\n- Second action `R`: moving right from `[6, 4]` to `[6, 5]`, `[6, 6]`, `[6, 7]`, `[6, 8]`.\n- Third action `U`: moving up from `[6, 8]` to `[5, 8]` (wall).\n- We need to find a way to reach the waypoints.\n- Let's start moving left from the starting position. Moving left from `[8, 8]` to `[8, 7]` (wall 'X').\n- Let's move up first. Moving up from `[8, 8]` to `[7, 8]`, `[6, 8]`, `[5, 8]` (wall).\n- Now, if we move left from `[6, 8]`:\n    - Moving left: `[6, 7]`, `[6, 6]`, `[6, 5]`, `[6, 4]` (wall).\n    - Moving right from `[6, 4]` to `[6, 5]`, `[6, 6]`, `[6, 7]`, `[6, 8]`.\n    - If we keep moving left from `[6, 8]` through multiple steps, we will reach the waypoint `1` at `[5, 3]`.\n        - First, move left from `[6, 8]` to `[6, 7]`, `[6, 6]`, `[6, 5]`, then move up to `[5, 5]`, then left to `[5, 4]`, then left to `[5, 3]` (waypoint `1`). The direction was left when we reached the waypoint.\n    - The next action from the device actions is `U`. So, we change the direction to up and start moving from `[5, 3]`.\n        - Moving up from `[5, 3]` to `[4, 3]` (wall). So, we need to adjust.\n    - Let's re - think our path.\n    - Starting from `[8, 8]` moving left to `[8, 7]` (wall), moving up to `[7, 8]`, then left:\n        - We can reach waypoint `1` at `[5, 3]` by moving left from `[7, 8]` to `[7, 7]`, `[7, 6]`, `[7, 5]`, `[7, 4]`, then up to `[6, 4]`, then up to `[5, 4]`, then left to `[5, 3]`. The action to reach waypoint `1` is `L` and the position is `[5, 3]`.\n    - After reaching waypoint `1`, the next device action is `U`. We change the direction to up and move from `[5, 3]`. Moving up to `[4, 3]` (wall). So, we move right from `[5, 3]` to `[5, 4]`, then up to `[4, 4]`, then up to `[3, 4]`, then right to `[3, 5]`, then right to `[3, 6]`, then right to `[3, 7]` (waypoint `2`). The action to reach waypoint `2` is `R` and the position is `[3, 7]`.\n    - After reaching waypoint `2`, the next device action is `L`. We change the direction to left and move from `[3, 7]`. Moving left to `[3, 6]`, then left to `[3, 5]`, then left to `[3, 4]`, then down to `[4, 4]`, then down to `[5, 4]`, then down to `[6, 4]`, then down to `[7, 4]`, then left to `[7, 3]` (waypoint `3`).

Moving down from [1, 8], we can move 3 steps until we reach the row with the way - point '1' at [4, 8]. When we reach the way - point '1' at [5, 2], we change the direction. The direction after reaching the way - point is the next action in the `Device Actions` list, which is 'R' (right).\n   - The action sequence so far is [['D', 5, 2]].\n2. **Second action: 'R' (Right)**\n   - Starting from [5, 2], moving right, we can move 1 step until we reach the way - point '2' at [0, 6]. After reaching the way - point '2', we change the direction to the next action in the `Device Actions` list, which is 'U' (up).\n   - The action sequence becomes [['D', 5, 2], ['R', 0, 6]].\n3. **Third action: 'U' (Up)**\n   - Starting from [0, 6], moving up is not possible as we are at the top - most row. So, we cannot perform this action until we reach the correct path. But we continue the process.\n4. **Fourth action: 'L' (Left)**\n   - Since we couldn't move up, we continue with the next action. Starting from the last way - point position [0, 6], moving left, we can move until we reach the way - point '3' at [6, 0]. After reaching the way - point '3', we change the direction to the next action in the `Device Actions` list, which is 'D' (down).\n   - The action sequence becomes [['D', 5, 2], ['R', 0, 6], ['L', 6, 0]].\n5. **Fifth action: 'D' (Down)**\n   - Starting from [6, 0], moving down, we can move further depending on the maze structure. But for the purpose of this step - by - step process, we have completed the processing of all the given device actions.\n\n\nAnswer: [['D', 5, 2], ['R', 0, 6], ['L', 6, 0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

First, find the starting position of the protagonist:\n   - By looking at the maze board, we can see that the protagonist 'P' is at the position `[4, 13]`.\n2. Analyze the initial direction and the first - waypoint:\n   - The initial direction is `left`.\n   - The first waypoint is `1` which is at the position `[3, 1]`.\n3. Calculate the actions to reach the first waypoint:\n   - To reach the waypoint `1` from `[4, 13]` with the initial direction `left`, we need to move `left` until we are in the correct column and then `up` to the correct row.\n   - First, we move `left` 12 steps to reach the column of the waypoint `1`. But we have device actions `['U', 'R', 'D']`. So, we start with the first device action `U`.\n   - To reach the waypoint `1` using the device actions, we need to move `U` 1 step, then `R` 1 step (to adjust the position a bit), and then `U` 3 more steps.\n   - The action sequence to reach the first waypoint `1` is:\n     - First, move `U` 1 step from `[4, 13]` to `[3, 13]`.\n     - Then move `R` 0 steps (because it doesn't help us to get closer to the waypoint in this case).\n     - Then move `U` 3 steps from `[3, 13]` to `[0, 13]`, then move `L` 12 steps to reach `[0, 1]`, then move `D` 3 steps to reach `[3, 1]`.\n     - The action to trigger the first waypoint `1` is `D` at position `[3, 1]`.\n4. After reaching the first waypoint, change the direction:\n   - After reaching the waypoint `1`, we change the direction. Since we came from the `up` direction to the waypoint `1`, we can assume the new direction is `right` (by convention of changing direction at waypoints).\n5. Find the second waypoint:\n   - The second waypoint is `2` which is at the position `[1, 3]`.\n   - To reach the waypoint `2` from `[3, 1]` with the new direction `right`, we move `R` 2 steps to reach `[3, 3]`, then `U` 2 steps to reach `[1, 3]`. The action to trigger the second waypoint `2` is `U` at position `[1, 3]`.\n6. After reaching the second waypoint, change the direction:\n   - After reaching the waypoint `2`, we change the direction. Since we came from the `down` direction to the waypoint `2`, we can assume the new direction is `left` (by convention of changing direction at waypoints).\n7. Find the third waypoint:\n   - The third waypoint is `3` which is at the position `[13, 8]`.\n   - To reach the waypoint `3` from `[1, 3]` with the new direction `left`, we move `L` 3 steps to reach `[1, 0]`, then `D` 12 steps to reach `[13, 0]`, then `R` 8 steps to reach `[13, 8]`.

The waypoint 1 is at position [0, 9], waypoint 2 is at position [10, 13], and waypoint 3 is at position [3, 4].\n   - We start with the current direction 'left' and the sequence of device - actions ['U', 'R', 'D', 'L', 'U'].\n2. **Simulating the Movement**:\n   - **Step 1: Moving towards waypoint 1**\n     - We start moving according to the device actions. Since the current direction is 'left', we first process the 'U' action.\n     - We move up until we hit a wall or a waypoint. Moving up from [10, 9], we can move up 9 steps to reach [1, 9]. Then moving left one step, we reach the waypoint 1 at [0, 9]. So the first action is ['U', 9, 9].\n     - After reaching waypoint 1, we change the direction. Since we were moving left - up to reach the waypoint, and we follow the device action sequence, the next action in the sequence is 'R'. So the new direction is 'right'.\n   - **Step 2: Moving towards waypoint 2**\n     - Starting from [0, 9] and moving right, we need to calculate the number of steps. We can move right 4 steps until we hit a wall. Then, according to the device action sequence, the next action is 'D'. We move down 10 steps to reach the waypoint 2 at [10, 13]. So the actions are ['R', 4, 0] and ['D', 10, 13].\n     - After reaching waypoint 2, we change the direction.
