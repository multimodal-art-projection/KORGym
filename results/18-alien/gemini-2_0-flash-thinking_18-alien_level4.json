First, let's verify if all alien animals meet each criterion.\n\nCriterion 1: Reproduction are Asexual Reproduction\/oviparous\/Viviparous\/mammal\/Spore Reproduction.\nLooking at the 'Reproduction' feature for all aliens, we see that all of them are one of the specified types: mammal, Viviparous, Spore Reproduction, oviparous, or Asexual Reproduction. Thus, all aliens satisfy criterion 1.\n\nCriterion 2: Horns are 0\/1\/2\/3\/4\/5\/6\/7\/8\/9\/10.\nLooking at the 'Horns' feature for all aliens, we see that the number of horns is always within the range of 0 to 10. Thus, all aliens satisfy criterion 2.\n\nCriterion 3: Diet are Parasite\/herbivore\/Omnivore\/carnivore\/Insectivore.\nLooking at the 'Diet' feature for all aliens, we see that all of them have one of the specified diets: Parasite, Insectivore, carnivore, Scavenger, herbivore, or Omnivore.  Since Scavenger is not in the list, let's re-examine the condition. The condition is 'diet are Parasite\/herbivore\/Omnivore\/carnivore\/Insectivore'.  Scavenger is NOT in this list.  This is an error in my initial assumption.  Let's re-check.\nAh, I made a mistake in interpreting the condition.  The condition is 'diet are Parasite\/herbivore\/Omnivore\/carnivore\/Insectivore'.  It means that the allowed diet types are these five categories.  However, the alien list contains 'Scavenger' as a diet. Therefore, aliens with 'Scavenger' diet DO NOT meet this criterion.\n\nLet's identify aliens with 'Scavenger' diet:\nAlien(7): Name = ZjsY, Diet = Scavenger, ...\nAlien(17): Name = UyMKB, Diet = Scavenger, ...\nAlien(18): Name = FgOaw, Diet = Scavenger, ...\nAlien(20): Name = AnwrLz, Diet = Scavenger, ...\nAlien(26): Name = ewTdW, Diet = Scavenger, ...\nAlien(27): Name = ZjQQrD, Diet = Scavenger, ...\nAlien(28): Name = hWjGDYPs, Diet = Scavenger, ...\nAlien(38): Name = zKsdnj, Diet = Scavenger, ...\nAlien(46): Name = RVLedt, Diet = Scavenger, ...\nAlien(53): Name = vgv, Diet = Scavenger, ...\n\nThere are 10 aliens with 'Scavenger' diet.  These aliens do not meet the criteria.  We need to exclude these aliens from the count.\n\nCriterion 4: Color are cyan\/purple\/blue\/red\/green\/yellow\/orange.\nLooking at the 'Color' feature for all aliens, we see that all colors are in the specified list. So, all aliens satisfy criterion 4.\n\nCriterion 5: Legs are 0\/1\/2\/3\/4\/5\/6\/7\/8\/10.\nLooking at the 'Legs' feature for all aliens, we see that all leg counts are in the specified list. So, all aliens satisfy criterion 5.\n\nSo, the only criterion that some aliens fail to meet is criterion 3 (Diet).  Aliens with 'Scavenger' diet fail to meet criterion 3.  We need to exclude aliens with 'Scavenger' diet from the total count.\nLet's list the counts of each alien and exclude the 'Scavenger' diet aliens:\n\nTotal aliens:\nZcSFtoJx: 5 (Insectivore) - OK\nNZYFca: 4 (carnivore) - OK\nqCwd: 2 (Parasite) - OK\nZjsY: 1 (Scavenger) - NO\nBSnpIXj: 1 (carnivore) - OK\nuTJm: 3 (Parasite) - OK\ndzxuvE: 4 (Parasite) - OK\nRPhSOV: 1 (Omnivore) - OK\nSmpeFC: 1 (herbivore) - OK\nEVjse: 2 (carnivore) - OK\nUyMKB: 2 (Scavenger) - NO\nPQsswk: 2 (Insectivore) - OK\nAnwrLz: 1 (Scavenger) - NO\nCtLViFvD: 2 (Parasite) - OK\nqMFojieP: 1 (herbivore) - OK\nDZVP: 3 (Parasite) - OK\njWDORTI: 2 (Parasite) - OK\nZjQQrD: 2 (Scavenger) - NO\nhWjGDYPs: 2 (Scavenger) - NO\neNziQY: 2 (Omnivore) - OK\nvAUueXgf: 2 (Insectivore) - OK\nSfRBympI: 2 (Insectivore) - OK\nNfVEodTG: 2 (Parasite) - OK\naRr: 1 (carnivore) - OK\nZikpQm: 1 (carnivore) - OK\nvCbabcO: 1 (carnivore) - OK\nwIGUCctx: 1 (Omnivore) - OK\nqNBoGra: 2 (Omnivore) - OK\nRhbAKyyy: 1 (Insectivore) - OK\nxUQO: 1 (Omnivore) - OK\nzuy: 2 (Omnivore) - OK\nXNStUXMq: 3 (herbivore) - OK\ncFVeKbb: 1 (herbivore) - OK\nRVLedt: 2 (Scavenger) - NO\nNuKk: 1 (Insectivore) - OK\ndueX: 1 (herbivore) - OK\nGmpndv: 6 (Omnivore) - OK\nQBX: 1 (Parasite) - OK\nvgv: 1 (Scavenger) - NO\nGLKpIx: 2 (carnivore) - OK\npMVFbC: 1 (Insectivore) - OK\n\nCount the aliens that meet all criteria (excluding Scavenger diet):\n5 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 = ?\n\nLet's sum the counts, excluding the Scavenger aliens:\nTotal count from previous calculation was 78.\nCount of Scavenger aliens:\nZjsY: 1\nUyMKB: 2\nAnwrLz: 1\nZjQQrD: 2\nhWjGDYPs: 2\nRVLedt: 2\nvgv: 1\nTotal Scavenger aliens = 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 11\n\nSubtract the count of Scavenger aliens from the total count: 78 - 11 = 67.\n\nLet's recount, adding up the 'OK' counts:\n5+4+2+1+3+4+1+1+2+2+2+2+1+3+2+2+2+2+2+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+2+3+1+1+6+1+2+1 = 67\n\nFinal Answer: The total number of alien animals that meet the criteria is 67.\n\nAnswer: 67Answer: 67"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.
