Horns can be any value from 0 - 10.\n2. Diet can be Scavenger, Omnivore, herbivore, Insectivore, carnivore, or Parasite.\n3. Color can be red, yellow, cyan, green, orange, blue, or purple.\n4. Legs must be 2.\n5. Reproduction can be Spore Reproduction, Asexual Reproduction, mammal, Viviparous, or oviparous.\n\nLet's go through the list of aliens one - by - one and count the ones that meet the criteria:\n- For uHe: It has 2 legs, Parasite diet, purple color, 2 horns and Spore Reproduction. There are 2 of them.\n- For fcBjG: It has 2 legs, herbivore diet, orange color, 3 horns and mammal reproduction. There are 3 of them.\n- For HPTDXdl: It has 1 leg, so it does not meet the criteria.\n- For eqx: It has 2 legs, Insectivore diet, yellow color, 9 horns and Viviparous reproduction. There is 1 of it.\n- For wKs: It has 2 legs, herbivore diet, purple color, 3 horns and oviparous reproduction. There is 1 of it.\n- For gpbvOxYc: It has 2 legs, carnivore diet, purple color, 9 horns and oviparous reproduction. There are 3 of them.\n- For stZPA: It has 2 legs, Insectivore diet, cyan color, 1 horn and mammal reproduction. But it is not in the given list of counted aliens, so we don't consider it.\n- For YdBq: It has 6 legs, so it does not meet the criteria.\n- For qDjkJ: It has 9 legs, so it does not meet the criteria.\n- For tLo: It has 8 legs, so it does not meet the criteria.\n- For NwFmlT: It has 1 leg, so it does not meet the criteria.\n- For bdtYAnAw: It has 6 legs, so it does not meet the criteria.\n- For CAjUmE: It has 3 legs, so it does not meet the criteria.\n- For mAXK: It has 2 legs, carnivore diet, green color, 7 horns and Spore Reproduction. There are 2 of them.\n- For heGVsCn: It has 3 legs, so it does not meet the criteria.\n- For gCKGZtw: It has 2 legs, Parasite diet, cyan color, 10 horns and Asexual Reproduction.

The total number of legs is 403.\n\nAnswer: 403"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.
