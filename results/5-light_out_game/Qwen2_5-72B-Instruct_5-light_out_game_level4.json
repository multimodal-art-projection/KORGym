The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER' (without quotes), where YOUR_ANSWER is your final answer to the question,e.g.'Answer: (0,2), (2,1)'\nThe game consists of a 3 by 3 grid of lights at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1) and (2,2). '1' means the light at that position is on and '0' means the light at that position is off. When the game starts, a random number or a stored pattern of these lights is switched on. Pressing any of the lights will toggle it and the adjacent lights(up, left, right and down).For example, if the board is\n000\n000\n000\nyou press the button at (1,1), the board will be\n010\n111\n010\nIf the light is at the boundary of the board, it will only affect its adjacent lights. For example, if the board is\n000\n000\n000\nyou press the button at (2,1), the board will be\n000\n010\n111\nThe goal of this game is to switch all the lights off, preferably in as few button presses as possible. You should give you answer by a series of (a,b), which means press the light at row a and column b.You should give a series of (a,b) split by ',' to switch all the lights off.If the answer is not unique, just provide one correct answer.\nExample 1:\nIf the board is \n000\n010\n111\nWe press the button (2,1),  which will toggle the light at (2,1) and toggle the adjacent lights (1,1), (2,0) and (2,2). The game board is\n000\n000\n000\nAll the lights have been switched off. So, your answer can be 'Answer: (2,1)'.\nExample 2:\nIf the board is \n100\n011\n010\nFirst,  we press the button (0,0), which will toggle the light at (0,0) and toggle the adjacent lights (0,1) and (1,0). The game board is\n010\n111\n010\nThen, we press the button (1,1), which will toggle the light at (1,1) and toggle the adjacent lights (0,1),(1,0), (1,2) and (2,1) .The game board is\n000\n000\n000\nAll the lights have been switched off. So, your answer can be 'Answer: (0,0), (1,1)'.\nExample 3:\nIf the board is \n011\n000\n011\nWe press the button (2,2),  which will toggle the light at (2,2) and toggle the adjacent lights (2,1) and (1,2). The game board is\n011\n001\n000\nWe press the button (0,2),  which will toggle the light at (0,2) and toggle the adjacent lights (0,1) and (1,2). The game board is\n000\n000\n000\nAll the lights have been switched off. So, your answer can be 'Answer: (2,2) ,(0,2)'.\nBoard:\n001\n111\n111\n\n","epoch":1}
