The key is to model the problem as a system of linear equations modulo 2, where each equation represents the toggling effect of pressing a button on its adjacent lights.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Model the Problem with Equations**: Each light's state after pressing buttons is determined by the initial state and the sum (mod 2) of the presses affecting it. For a light at position \\((i, j)\\), the equation is:  \n   \\(\\text{sum of presses on } (i, j) \\text{ and its adjacent lights} \\equiv \\text{initial state of } (i, j) \\pmod{2}\\).  \n\n2. **Solve the System of Equations**: By expressing the variables (button presses) row by row, we can determine the required presses for each row based on the previous rows.

The goal is to find a sequence of button presses that turns all lights off. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. Each button press toggles the button and its adjacent buttons (up, down, left, right).\n2. The problem can be reduced to solving a system of linear equations over GF(2), where each equation represents the requirement to turn off a specific light.\n\n### Solution Process:\n1. **Initial Board State**:\n   ```\n   Row 0: 0 0 1 0\n   Row 1: 1 1 0 1\n   Row 2: 1 1 0 1\n   Row 3: 0 1 0 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Variable Setup**: Let \\( P[i][j] \\) denote whether the button at position \\((i,j)\\) is pressed (1) or not (0). We need to determine \\( P[i][j] \\) such that all lights are turned off.\n\n3. **Equations for Each Light**: Using the adjacency rules, we derive equations for each light. For example:\n   - For light \\((0,0)\\): \\( P[0][0] + P[0][1] + P[1][0] \\equiv 0 \\mod 2 \\).\n   - For light \\((0,2)\\): \\( P[0][1] + P[0][2] + P[0][3] + P[1][2] \\equiv 1 \\mod 2 \\).\n\n4. **Solving the System**: By expressing variables row by row and substituting dependencies, we find that pressing buttons \\((1,2)\\), \\((2,0)\\), \\((2,2)\\), and \\((3,1)\\) toggles the lights in such a way that all lights are turned off.\n\n### Verification:\n- Pressing \\((1,2)\\) toggles \\((1,2)\\), \\((0,2)\\), \\((1,1)\\), \\((1,3)\\), \\((2,2)\\).\n- Pressing \\((2,0)\\) toggles \\((2,0)\\), \\((1,0)\\), \\((2,1)\\), \\((3,0)\\).\n- Pressing \\((2,2)\\) toggles \\((2,2)\\), \\((1,2)\\), \\((2,1)\\), \\((2,3)\\), \\((3,2)\\).\n- Pressing \\((3,1)\\) toggles \\((3,1)\\), \\((2,1)\\), \\((3,0)\\), \\((3,2)\\).\n\nAfter these presses, all lights are turned off.\n\nAnswer: (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,1)"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Each light's state (on\/off) is determined by the initial state and the number of times it is toggled by button presses. The goal is to find a set of button presses such that all lights are off.\n\n### Key Steps:\n1. **Model the Problem**: Represent the grid as a 3x3 matrix where each cell (i,j) is a variable indicating whether the button at (i,j) is pressed (1) or not (0).\n2. **Formulate Equations**: For each light, write an equation based on its initial state and the buttons that toggle it. The sum of these toggles (mod 2) must equal the initial state (since we want the final state to be 0).\n3. **Solve the System**: Use substitution and elimination to solve the system of equations, finding the variables (button presses) that satisfy all equations.\n\n### Solution Verification\nThe solution involves pressing buttons (0,1), (0,2), and (1,0).

The solution involves setting up a system of linear equations modulo 2 (since toggling a light twice cancels its effect) and solving for the variables representing button presses.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Model the Problem as a System of Equations**: Each light's state (on=1, off=0) is determined by the initial state and the number of times it is toggled. For a light at position (i, j), the equation is the sum (mod 2) of the presses on (i, j) and its adjacent positions, equal to the initial state of (i, j).\n2. **Solve the System of Equations**: Using substitution and elimination, solve the system to find the variables (button presses) that satisfy all equations.
