You should give you answer by a series of (a,b), which means press the light at row a and column b.You should give a series of (a,b) split by ',' to switch all the lights off.If the answer is not unique, just provide one correct answer.\nExample 1:\nIf the board is \n000\n010\n111\nWe press the button (2,1),  which will toggle the light at (2,1) and toggle the adjacent lights (1,1), (2,0) and (2,2). The game board is\n000\n000\n000\nAll the lights have been switched off. So, your answer can be 'Answer: (2,1)'.\nExample 2:\nIf the board is \n100\n011\n010\nFirst,  we press the button (0,0), which will toggle the light at (0,0) and toggle the adjacent lights (0,1) and (1,0). The game board is\n010\n111\n010\nThen, we press the button (1,1), which will toggle the light at (1,1) and toggle the adjacent lights (0,1),(1,0), (1,2) and (2,1) .The game board is\n000\n000\n000\nAll the lights have been switched off. So, your answer can be 'Answer: (0,0), (1,1)'.\nExample 3:\nIf the board is \n011\n000\n011\nWe press the button (2,2),  which will toggle the light at (2,2) and toggle the adjacent lights (2,1) and (1,2). The game board is\n011\n001\n000\nWe press the button (0,2),  which will toggle the light at (0,2) and toggle the adjacent lights (0,1) and (1,2). The game board is\n000\n000\n000\nAll the lights have been switched off. So, your answer can be 'Answer: (2,2) ,(0,2)'.\nBoard:\n001\n111\n111\n\n","epoch":1,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
