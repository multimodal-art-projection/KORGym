Let's move to the second row.\nRow 1 is '010'. We need to consider the state of the first row to decide what to do in the second row.  Actually, we should process row by row to ensure the previous row becomes all '0's. Let's re-examine row 0 again.\nAfter pressing (0,1), row 0 becomes '000'. It is already all zeros. Let's proceed to the next row.\n\nNow we look at the second row of the current board:\n000\n010\n011\nRow 1 is '010'. We need to make the second row all zeros by pressing buttons in the second row without affecting the already solved first row. However, pressing buttons in row 1 will affect row 0 and row 2. The strategy should be: for each row, we examine the previous row. If there are lights on in the previous row, we press the button in the current row directly below the light that is on in the previous row.\n\nLet's rethink the strategy. We process row by row. For each row, we ensure the lights in the row above are off.\nInitial board:\n011\n000\n011\n\nConsider row 0: '011'.\nFor column 1 of row 0, the light is '1'. We press the button at (0,1).\nPress (0,1):\n000\n010\n011\n\nNow row 0 is '000'. Move to row 1.\nRow 1 of the current board is '010'. But we should look at the first row again before moving to the next row.\nAfter pressing (0,1), the first row becomes '000'. It is correct. Now we look at the second row of the updated board which is '010'.\nFor column 1 of row 0 in the original board, we pressed (0,1). For column 2 of row 0 in the original board, the light is '1', we press (0,2).\nPress (0,2):\n000\n011\n011\n\nNow row 0 is '000'.\nCurrent board:\n000\n011\n011\nMove to row 1. Row 1 is '011'.\nFor column 1 of row 1, the light is '1'. We press (1,1).\nPress (1,1):\n000\n001\n001\n\nNow the first light in row 1 is off. For column 2 of row 1, the light is '1'. We press (1,2).\nPress (1,2):\n000\n000\n010\n\nNow row 1 is '000'. Move to row 2.\nRow 2 is '010'.\nFor column 1 of row 2, the light is '1'. We press (2,1).\nPress (2,1):\n000\n000\n000\n\nNow row 2 is '000'. All lights are off.\nThe sequence of presses is (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1).\n\nLet's write down the steps and board states clearly.\nInitial Board:\n011\n000\n011\n\nPress (0,1):\n000\n010\n011\n\nPress (0,2):\n000\n011\n011\n\nPress (1,1):\n000\n001\n001\n\nPress (1,2):\n000\n000\n010\n\nPress (2,1):\n000\n000\n000\n\nAnswer: (0,1),(0,2),(1,1),(1,2),(2,1)\n\nAnswer: (0,1),(0,2),(1,1),(1,2),(2,1)"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.
