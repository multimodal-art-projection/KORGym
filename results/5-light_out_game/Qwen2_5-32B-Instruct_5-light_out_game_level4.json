However, assuming the board provided is intended and we adapt the solution accordingly for a 4x4 grid, let's solve it.\n\nTo solve this, we need to find a sequence of button presses that will turn all the lights off. We can approach this by pressing buttons that will eventually lead to turning off all the lights.\n\nLet's start with the given board:\n\n```\n0100\n0101\n0110\n0000\n```\n\nWe can try pressing (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), and (2,2):\n\n1. Press (0,1):\n```\n1010\n1011\n0110\n0000\n```\n\n2. Press (1,1):\n```\n0100\n0100\n1000\n0000\n```\n\n3. Press (2,1):\n```\n0100\n0110\n0110\n0000\n```\n\n4.

Press (2,0):\n```\n0000\n0000\n0000\n0000\n```\n\nSo, a sequence that works is: (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2), (0,2), (1,0), (2,0).\n\nHowever, since the original problem specifies a 3x3 grid and the board provided is 4x4, I'll assume a correction to the problem statement is needed.
