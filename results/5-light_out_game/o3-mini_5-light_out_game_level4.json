One possible solution is as follows. First note that the board (numbered with rows 0–3 and columns 0–3) is\n\n Row 0: 0 1 1 0  \n Row 1: 1 0 1 1  \n Row 2: 1 0 1 0  \n Row 3: 1 0 1 0\n\nOne idea is to “clear” the top row by “fixing” every lit cell with a press in the row beneath. In our solution we decide not to press anything in Row 0. Then, since in Row 0 the lights at columns 1 and 2 are on (that is, cells (0,1) and (0,2) are 1) we press the two “buttons” right under them—that is, press (1,1) and press (1,2). (Remember that pressing a cell toggles itself and its neighbors up, down, left and right.)\n\nSimulating these two presses we have:\n • Press (1,1) toggles cells (1,1), (0,1), (2,1) and also (1,0) and (1,2).  \n • Then press (1,2) toggles cells (1,2), (0,2), (2,2) and also (1,1) and (1,3).\n\nAfter these moves the entire Row 0 is cleared.  \nNext, we look at Row 1; now its only on–light is (1,2) (which got “turned on” by the previous steps). So we press below in Row 2: press (2,2). This press toggles (2,2) itself, its vertical neighbors (1,2) and (3,2), and its horizontal neighbors (2,1) and (2,3). After this press Row 1 becomes all zeros.\n\nAt this point the board looks like:\n Row 0: 0 0 0 0  \n Row 1: 0 0 0 0  \n Row 2: 1  ? 1 1  (the question mark “?” means the cell has been toggled to 0 if it was 1 – after checking, Row 2 becomes 1,0,1,1)  \n Row 3: 1 0 1 0\n\nFinally, we “clear” Row 2 by “fixing” its lit cells in Row 3. In Row 2 the on–lights now occur at columns 0, 2 and 3. So we press (3,0), (3,2) and (3,3) in Row 3. (For example, press (3,0) toggles (3,0) itself together with its neighbors (2,0) and (3,1); pressing (3,2) and (3,3) similarly “push” the unwanted ones off.)\n\nA quick simulation shows that after these moves all cells become 0. (Since the effect “adds mod2” the order does not matter.) \n\nThus one valid series of moves to switch off all lights is:\n (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2) and (3,3).\n\nAnswer: (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (3,3)"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

(There is more than one possible solution.) One method is to use a “row‐by‐row elimination” strategy. (For example, with a 4×4 board the idea is to choose moves on row 0 arbitrarily and then select moves on row 1 to cancel any lit lights from row 0, then use row 2 moves to “fix” row 1, etc.) In our board the rows (numbered 0–3) read as follows:\n\n Row0: 0 1 0 0  \n Row1: 0 1 0 1  \n Row2: 0 1 1 0  \n Row3: 0 0 0 0\n\nThat is, the lights that are ON (shown by “1”) are at positions (0,1), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1) and (2,2).\n\nOne solution found by the elimination method is as follows:\n\n1. Notice row 0 has a “1” at (0,1). In the standard strategy one “fixes” a lit cell in row r by pressing the cell just below it (on row r+1, same column). So we press (1,1). This has the following effects:\n – It toggles (1,1) as well as its adjacent cells (0,1), (1,0), (1,2) and (2,1). In particular, the (0,1) light is turned off.\n \n2. Now look at row 1 (after that move, the remaining “on” cells in row 1 were at (1,0), (1,2) and (1,3); the press at (1,1) already cancelled (1,1)). To cancel these, we press on row 2 in the corresponding columns:\n – Press (2,0) to fix (1,0),\n – Press (2,2) to fix (1,2),\n – Press (2,3) to fix (1,3).\n\n3. These row-2 presses change row 2 as well. Recalculating (after the moves from rows 1 and 2) the “on” cells in row 2 turn out to be at (2,0) and (2,2) are toggled by the moves so far; one finds that (2,0) and (2,2) are not yet completely fixed. In our working the net effect (when taken mod2) leaves row 2 with (2,0) and (2,2) still “on” (or rather, with a leftover if not fixed by further moves)—and also (2,2) may need another toggle. To fix the remaining lights in row 2 the standard procedure is to use the row below it (row 3). In our solution, we choose:\n – Press (3,0) to cancel the effect at (2,0),\n – Press (3,2) to cancel the remaining light contributed at (2,2).\n\nWhen you check (each press toggles its own cell and the four orthogonal neighbours) the sequence of moves\n (1,1), (2,0), (2,2), (2,3), (3,0), (3,2)\nturns all the lights off.\n\nThus, one valid sequence of button-presses is: (1,1), (2,0), (2,2), (2,3), (3,0), (3,2).\n\nAnswer: (1,1), (2,0), (2,2), (2,3), (3,0), (3,2)"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

One approach is to “fix” the rows one‐by‐one. For example, we can decide not to press any button in row 0 (i.e. set row 0 presses to 0). Then, noting that a press at a cell toggles the light at that cell and its immediate neighbors (up, down, left and right), we see that the lights in row 0 are affected only by a press in row 0 (neighbors left\/right) and by presses directly below in row 1. Since every light must end “off” (i.e. sum mod 2 equals 0) and the initial state of row 0 is 1 1 1 1, we must cancel that “1” in each cell by choosing row 1 presses as follows:\n\n• For cell (0,0): only row 1’s (1,0) can cancel its “1”. So set (1,0)=1.\n• For (0,1): (1,1) must be pressed, so (1,1)=1.\n• For (0,2): require (1,2)=1.\n• For (0,3): require (1,3)=1.\n\nThus row 1 becomes: 1 1 1 1.\n\nNext, we “fix” row 1. Write down the effect on a given cell in row 1 from:\n – its own press from row 1,\n – its neighbors within row 1 (left\/right),\n – the press in row 0 (already chosen: all zeros), and\n – the press from the next row, row 2.\n\nWorking cell‐by‐cell we get (after doing the parity sums modulo 2):\n\n• (1,0): initial 1 plus (1,0)=1 and right neighbor (1,1)=1 gives 1+1+1 = 1 (mod 2), so we must select (2,0)=1.\n• (1,1): initial 0 plus (1,1)=1, left (1,0)=1, right (1,2)=1 gives 1+1+1 = 1, so (2,1)=1.\n• (1,2): initial 1 plus (1,2)=1, and its neighbors (1,1)=1 and (1,3)=1 sum (with mod‑2 arithmetic) to 1 already, so (2,2)=0.\n• (1,3): initial 0 plus (1,3)=1 and left (1,2)=1 gives 1+1 = 0, so (2,3)=0.\n\nThus row 2 becomes: 1 1 0 0.\n\nThen, we fix row 2. Its cells are affected by row 1 (already set), row 2 itself and row 3 (yet to be determined). Working out each cell:\n\n• (2,0): initial 0 plus from row 1 at (1,0)=1, row 2 (cell itself 1) and its right neighbor (2,1)=1 gives 1+1+1 = 1, so we need to press (3,0)=1.\n• (2,1): initial 0 plus from row 1 at (1,1)=1, row 2’s (2,1)=1 and left (2,0)=1 gives 1+1+1 = 1, so (3,1)=1.\n• (2,2): initial 1 plus (1,2)=1, plus row 2’s (2,2)=0 and left neighbor (2,1)=1 gives 1+1+0+1 = 1 (mod 2), so (3,2)=1.\n• (2,3): initial 1 plus (1,3)=1 and (2,3)=0 (its left neighbor (2,2)=0) gives 1+1 = 0, so (3,3)=0.\n\nThus row 3 becomes: 1 1 1 0.\n\nFinally, one can verify that the last row also ends up all “off” when adding the contributions from row 2 (already chosen), row 3, and the appropriate neighboring terms (note that cells on the border have fewer neighbors). One may check, for example, that for (3,0):\n initial 1 + (2,0)=1 + (3,0)=1 + neighbor (3,1)=1 gives 1+1+1+1 = 0 mod 2.\nA similar check shows all row 3 cells are cancelled.\n\nTo list the buttons we pressed (ignoring those we left at 0) we have:\n\nRow 1: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)\nRow 2: (2,0), (2,1)\nRow 3: (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)\n\nThus one valid sequence of moves (order does not matter, since modulo‑2 addition is commutative) is:\n\n(1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,0), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)\n\nAnswer: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,0), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

(There are many methods to get a solution; below is one way.) \n\nNote that although the original examples were for a 3×3 board, the board given here has four rows and four columns. We label rows 0–3 and columns 0–3 so that the top‐left light is (0,0) and the bottom‐right is (3,3).\n\nThe board is shown as follows (each digit represents a cell’s “on” (1) or “off” (0) state):\n\n Row0: 1 0 1 1  \n Row1: 1 0 0 1  \n Row2: 1 1 1 1  \n Row3: 1 0 1 1  \n\nRecall that pressing a cell (i, j) toggles that cell and its (up, left, right, down) neighbors (if they exist).\n\nOne standard method to solve such puzzles is to “force” the rows one by one. In our scheme we define a press pattern X such that X(i,j)=1 if we press at (i,j) and 0 otherwise. The effect on a given cell is the sum (mod2) of its initial value plus contributions from any press that toggles it. (For interior cells these contributors are the press at the cell itself and those immediately above, below, left, and right.)\n\nA common strategy is to choose a “first‐row” press pattern arbitrarily and then “force” presses on subsequent rows so that the row above ends up cleared (all 0’s). (One may show that an appropriate “first row” exists so that the final (last) row will be automatically turned off.) In our solution we choose a first‐row press pattern of all 0’s. (Other first–row choices would lead to different, but still valid, sequences.)\n\nThen one computes in order:\n • For row 0 we require that the net toggle on (0,j) is 0 (i.e. off). Since the toggling on a 0th‑row cell comes from a press in row0 (neighbors left\/right) and a press at (1,j) (from below), one “forces” the presses in row 1:\n  For each j, set X(1,j) = B(0,j) + [X(0, j–1) + X(0,j) + X(0, j+1)] (all mod2).  \n  With X(0,* ) all zeros and B(0,*) = [1,0,1,1] this gives X(1,0)=1, X(1,1)=0, X(1,2)=1, X(1,3)=1.\n \n • Next, for each cell in row 1 (which now “feels” the effect of row0 and row1), we force the press in row 2:\n  For each j, set X(2,j) = B(1,j) + [X(0,j) + X(1,j–1) + X(1,j) + X(1,j+1)].\n  Since B(1,*) = [1,0,0,1] and X(1,*) = [1,0,1,1], one obtains X(2,0)=0, X(2,1)=0, X(2,2)=0, X(2,3)=1.\n \n • Then for row 2, we force row 3:\n  For each j, set X(3,j) = B(2,j) + [X(1,j) + X(2,j–1) + X(2,j) + X(2,j+1)].\n  With B(2,*) = [1,1,1,1] and X(2,*) = [0,0,0,1] (and X(1,*) as before) one finds X(3,0)=0, X(3,1)=1, X(3,2)=1, X(3,3)=1.\n \n • Finally, one must check that after these presses the last row (row 3) comes out all off. (A cell (3,j) receives toggles from X(3,j), its horizontal neighbors in row 3 and the press X(2,j) from the row above.) A check shows that every cell in the last row becomes 0. \n\nThus a valid press pattern is given by:\n Row0: 0  0  0  0  \n Row1: 1  0  1  1  \n Row2: 0  0  0  1  \n Row3: 0  1  1  1  \n\nSince the order of button presses does not matter, one acceptable answer is to press on every cell where our press pattern equals 1. Listing these positions in (row, column) order we obtain:\n (1,0), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3).\n\nMany different solutions exist; the above is one valid answer.\n\nAnswer: (1,0), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

In this explanation we use 0-indexed row and column numbers. Although there may be many valid solutions, one possible correct solution is the following.\n\nStep 1. We note the board is now 4×4 (with rows 0–3 and columns 0–3) with initial state\n\n Row 0: 1 1 1 1  \n Row 1: 1 0 1 1  \n Row 2: 1 0 0 0  \n Row 3: 0 1 0 0\n\nSince only a press in the row below affects a given row (aside from a press in the same row and lateral neighbors), one strategy is to fix row 0 by “correcting” it with presses in row 1. In our method we choose no presses in row 0 and then to “cancel” the lit lights in row 0 we press every corresponding button in row 1. (Because pressing (1,j) toggles the light directly above, i.e. (0,j).) In our case row 0 is all 1’s; hence we decide to press every button in row 1 – that is, (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) and (1,3).\n\nStep 2. With row 1 now pressed and with the rules that a press toggles the light at its own cell plus those immediately up, down, left and right, we look at the new state in row 1. (Remember also that row 1’s state is affected not only by its own presses but also by presses from row 0 and (later) row 2.) Requiring that row 1 become all 0’s forces conditions on row 2. Working through the toggling effects (each toggle happens modulo 2) one finds that to cancel the remaining “on” lights in row 1 we must press (2,0), (2,1) and (2,3) (and not press (2,2)).\n\nStep 3. Now the presses in row 1 and row 2 will have affected row 2. Examining row 2 (initially 1 0 0 0) we determine what is needed in row 3 so that row 2 ends all off. A similar analysis shows that we must press (3,1) and (3,2) (and leave (3,0) and (3,3) unpressed).\n\nStep 4. Finally, one must verify that after applying all these button presses the last row (row 3) also results in all 0’s. A check shows that indeed the toggles from the presses in row 2 and row 3 leave row 3 off. (For instance, cell (3,1) is toggled by its own press, by adjacent presses from (3,2) and by the press above at (2,1); taking the initial value 1 plus these toggles gives an even number of toggles (modulo 2), so the light ends “off”.)\n\nThus one valid sequence of presses is as follows:\n Press row 1: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)\n Press row 2: (2,0), (2,1), (2,3)\n Press row 3: (3,1), (3,2)\n\nYou may press these buttons in any order (since the operations commute modulo 2).

Although the original description used a 3×3 board, the board given here is\n\n  Row0: 1 1 0 0  \n  Row1: 1 1 1 0  \n  Row2: 1 0 1 0  \n  Row3: 0 0 1 0\n\nWe label a cell’s row and column by (r, c) with r and c starting at 0 at the top‐left. When you press a light at (r, c) it toggles the light at (r, c) and its adjacent lights (up, down, left, right if they exist).\n\nOne way to “solve” the board is to “set up” equations row‐by‐row: choose the presses in row0 arbitrarily (free variables) and then force the row below to “clear” the lit cells created in the previous row. (This is how one solves “Lights Out” puzzles.) In our analysis we denote the press at (r, c) by P(r, c) ∈ {0,1} (1 means you press that button) and the effect on a cell is the sum (mod 2) of the initial value plus the contributions of the presses on that cell and on the adjacent ones. (Toggling twice does nothing.)\n\nFor the board we have, one systematic solution shows that the presses in subsequent rows are determined in terms of the top row’s four free variables. For simplicity we choose all free variables equal to 0:\n  P(0,0)=0, P(0,1)=0, P(0,2)=0, P(0,3)=0.\nThen the row–by–row analysis forces:\n  Row1:\n   P(1,0) = 1    (from cell (0,0)’s equation)\n   P(1,1) = 1    (from cell (0,1))\n   P(1,2) = 0    (from cell (0,2))\n   P(1,3) = 0    (from cell (0,3))\n  Row2:\n   P(2,0) = 1    (from (1,0))\n   P(2,1) = 1    (from (1,1))\n   P(2,2) = 0    (from (1,2))\n   P(2,3) = 0    (from (1,3))\n  Row3:\n   P(3,0) = 0  \n   P(3,1) = 1  \n   P(3,2) = 0  \n   P(3,3) = 0\n\nA quick “play‐through” of these presses shows they do indeed toggle lights in such a way that every light is eventually turned off. (For example, pressing (1,0) toggles (1,0), its right (1,1), its above (0,0) and below (2,0). Then pressing (1,1) toggles (1,1) plus (0,1), (1,0), (1,2) and (2,1); and so on. In the end every light ends as 0.)\n\nThus one valid solution is to press the buttons in the order (the order does not matter in these puzzles):\n\n  (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1), (3,1)\n\nNow I provide the answer in the required format.\n\nAnswer: (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1), (3,1)"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

(In a Lights Out puzzle the solution exists in many forms; any valid solution is acceptable.)\n\nOne such solution is found by choosing no presses in row 0. Then one must press in row 1 to cancel a lit cell in row 0. (Notice that (0,2) is lit initially so we require a press at (1,2) to toggle (0,2).) Working out the required moves row–by–row we obtain the following moves:\n • In row 1, press (1,2) [This toggles (1,2) and also toggles (0,2), (1,1), (1,3) and (2,2).]\n • In row 2, to “fix” row 1 we calculate that one must press (2,0) to cancel the lit (1,0), and also press (2,2) and (2,3) (the numbers work out so that row 1 becomes all off).\n • Finally, in row 3 we need to cancel the remaining “carry–overs” from row 2; the calculation shows that pressing (3,0) and (3,2) does the job.\n\nOne may verify by simulating the effect (toggling a cell flips its state 0↔1) that after these button presses the board becomes all zeros. (Remember that the order of pressing does not matter mod 2.) For example, the press at (1,2) turns off the lit cell (0,2) and may turn other cells on or off; then, the moves in row 2 cancel the lights in row 1; finally the moves in row 3 fix the last row. One acceptable complete solution is therefore to press, in any order, the following cells:\n (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (2,3), (3,0), (3,2).\n\nAccordingly, in the required output format the answer is:\n\nAnswer: (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (2,3), (3,0), (3,2)"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

We decide on a “first–row” pattern (here we assume no presses in row 0) and then determine the moves in row 1 which make row 0 all off, and so on. (Since toggling is done modulo 2, the order of pressing does not matter.)\n\nStep 1. Assume we do not press any button in row 0; that is, let x₀₀ = x₀₁ = x₀₂ = x₀₃ = 0.\n\nTo clear row 0 we must have, for each cell (0,j):\n final(0,j) = initial(0,j) + (presses affecting it) ≡ 0 (mod 2).\n\nFor example, cell (0,0) is affected by itself, (0,1), and the button just below it at (1,0). Since we did not press in row 0, we choose x₁₀ so that 0 (initial) + x₁₀ = 0 → x₁₀ = 0.\nSimilarly, for (0,1) (neighbors: (0,1), (0,0), (0,2), and (1,1)): 1 + 0 + 0 + x₁₁ ≡ 0, so x₁₁ = 1.\nRepeating for row 0 cells gives the required presses in row 1 as:\n x₁₀ = 0, x₁₁ = 1, x₁₂ = 1, x₁₃ = 1.\n\nStep 2. Now use the fact that the lights in row 1 are affected by presses in row 0, row 1, and row 2. Working cell–by–cell in row 1 and using our known x₁⋆ and knowing row 0 had no presses, we can choose row 2 presses to clear row 1. Doing the arithmetic modulo 2 yields:\n x₂₀ = 0, x₂₁ = 1, x₂₂ = 1, x₂₃ = 1.\n\nStep 3. For row 2, use a similar procedure. The effect on a cell in row 2 comes from row 1, row 2, and row 3.

Working though the equations one finds\n\n p(1,0)=0, p(1,1)=1, p(1,2)=0, p(1,3)=1;\n p(2,0)=0, p(2,1)=1, p(2,2)=1, p(2,3)=0;\n p(3,0)=0, p(3,1)=0, p(3,2)=1, p(3,3)=1.\n\nPressing the buttons in the cells where p = 1 – that is, (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2) and (3,3) – will toggle the lights (recall that order is irrelevant because toggling is commutative) so that we end with all lights off.\n\nLet’s check briefly by simulation:\n1. Start with the board\n Row0: 0 1 0 1\n Row1: 1 0 1 1\n Row2: 1 1 1 1\n Row3: 0 0 1 0.\n2. Pressing (1,1) toggles (1,1) plus its neighbors (0,1), (1,0), (1,2) and (2,1).\n3. Then pressing (1,3) toggles (1,3), (0,3), (1,2) and (2,3).\n4. Next, (2,1) toggles (2,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2) and (3,1).\n5. Then (2,2) toggles (2,2), (1,2), (2,1), (2,3) and (3,2).\n6. Then (3,2) toggles (3,2), (2,2), (3,1) and (3,3).\n7. Finally, (3,3) toggles (3,3), (2,3) and (3,2).\n\nA careful check shows that with these presses the board becomes all zeros (all lights off).

In my solution the sequence of presses I obtained is as follows:\n\n1. Because row0’s light at (0,1) is on (and no press was used in row0), I need to cancel it by pressing (1,1). (This makes row0 all off.)\n2. Next, with the effect of row0 and row1 presses, the residual “lit” status in row1 is corrected by pressing in row2. In our simulation, we find that to cancel the lights in row1 we must press all cells in row2: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) and (2,3).\n3.

One common way to solve these “Lights Out” puzzles is to “clear” the board row‐by‐row. (There is no requirement to use the minimum number of moves; any valid sequence that turns all lights off is acceptable.)\n\nBelow is one way to obtain a solution. In our solution we decide not to press any button in row 0. Instead we “fix” row 0 by pressing buttons in row 1. Then we continue row‐by‐row and finally check that the last row (row 3) is all off. (All arithmetic is done mod 2 where 1 means “pressed” or “light on” and 0 means “not pressed” or “light off”.)\n\nLet p[r][c] be 1 if we press at cell (r, c).\n\nStep 1. Assume no buttons are pressed in row 0:\n p[0,0]=0, p[0,1]=0, p[0,2]=0, p[0,3]=0.\n\nFor each cell i in row 0, the light at (0,i) will be toggled by:\n – the (0,i) press (p[0,i]),\n – its left\/right neighbors in row 0,\n – and the press in row 1 directly beneath it.\nBecause we set row 0 presses to 0, to “cancel” the lights initially on in row 0 we determine row 1 presses as follows:\n • For (0,0): It gets toggled only by p[1,0] (neighbors that exist). We need p[1,0] to be 0 (since b[0,0]=0), so p[1,0]=0.\n • For (0,1): The toggles affecting (0,1) come from p[0,1] (0), its left p[0,0] (0) and right p[0,2] (0) — so we require p[1,1]=b[0,1]=1.\n • For (0,2): Similarly, p[1,2]=b[0,2]=1.\n • For (0,3): p[1,3]=b[0,3]=1.\n\nThus, row 1 presses are:\n Row1: p[1,0]=0, p[1,1]=1, p[1,2]=1, p[1,3]=1.\n\nStep 2. Now “clear” row 1 by deciding row 2 presses. For each cell in row 1 the light state (after already accounting for row 0 and row 1 presses) must be turned off. For example:\n\n For (1,0): Its togglers are:\n  – p[1,0] (itself, =0),\n  – above p[0,0] (=0),\n  – left: none,\n  – right: p[1,1] (=1),\n  – below: p[2,0] (unknown).\n We need 0+0+1+p[2,0] ≡ b[1,0]. Since b[1,0]=1, we must have 1+p[2,0] ≡1 so p[2,0]=0.\n\n For (1,1): Togglers are:\n  – p[1,1]=1,\n  – above p[0,1]=0 (remember row 0 wasn’t pressed),\n  – left p[1,0]=0,\n  – right p[1,2]=1,\n  – below p[2,1] (unknown).\n Sum = 1+0+0+1 + p[2,1] = 2+p[2,1] ≡ p[2,1] (since 2≡0 mod2). We require p[2,1] ≡ b[1,1]=0. So, p[2,1]=0.\n\n For (1,2): Togglers:\n  – p[1,2]=1,\n  – above p[0,2]=0,\n  – left p[1,1]=1,\n  – right p[1,3]=1,\n  – below p[2,2] (unknown).\n Sum = 1+0+1+1+p[2,2] = 3+p[2,2] ≡ 1+p[2,2] (since 3 mod2=1). We want 1+p[2,2] ≡ b[1,2]=0, so p[2,2] must be 1.\n\n For (1,3): Togglers:\n  – p[1,3]=1,\n  – above p[0,3]=0,\n  – left p[1,2]=1,\n  – below p[2,3] (unknown; right nonexistent).\n Sum = 1+0+1+p[2,3] = 2+p[2,3] ≡ p[2,3]. This must equal b[1,3]=1, so p[2,3]=1.\n\nThus, row 2 presses become:\n Row2: p[2,0]=0, p[2,1]=0, p[2,2]=1, p[2,3]=1.\n\nStep 3. Now decide row 3 presses (last row) so that row 2 lights are turned off.\nFor (2,0): Togglers affecting cell (2,0):\n – p[2,0]=0,\n – above p[1,0]=0,\n – right p[2,1]=0,\n – below p[3,0] (unknown),\n – left: none.\nWe need p[3,0] ≡ b[2,0]=1, so p[3,0]=1.\n\nFor (2,1): Togglers:\n – p[2,1]=0,\n – above p[1,1]=1,\n – left p[2,0]=0,\n – right p[2,2]=1,\n – below p[3,1] (unknown).\nSum = 0+1+0+1+p[3,1] = 2+p[3,1] ≡ p[3,1].

We require 1+p[3,2] ≡ b[2,2]=0, hence p[3,2]=1.\n\nFor (2,3): Togglers:\n – p[2,3]=1,\n – above p[1,3]=1,\n – left p[2,2]=1,\n – below p[3,3] (unknown).\nSum = 1+1+1+p[3,3] = 3+p[3,3] ≡ 1+p[3,3]. Set 1+p[3,3] ≡ b[2,3]=0, so p[3,3]=1.\n\nThus, row 3 presses become:\n Row3: p[3,0]=1, p[3,1]=1, p[3,2]=1, p[3,3]=1.\n\nStep 4. (Verification) Finally, we check that the last row (row 3) is all off when accounting for the toggles from row 3 itself and from the row above:\n For a boundary cell like (3,0): togglers are p[3,0] (1), above: p[2,0]=0, right: p[3,1]=1. Total = 1+0+1 = 2 ≡0 mod2, matching b[3,0]=0.\n A similar verification works for the other cells in row 3.\n\nSo one valid sequence of presses (nonzero entries of p) is:\n Row1: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)\n Row2: (2,2), (2,3)\n Row3: (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n\nThe order in which you press them does not matter (since toggling is commutative modulo 2). One acceptable answer is to list the moves in row–order.\n\nThus the answer is:\n\nAnswer: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game problem-solver, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.
