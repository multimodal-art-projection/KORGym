This involves moving tiles in the rightmost column (3, 5, 9) up, then tiles in the third column (2, 11) right, and finally tile 8 right to free (4,1).  \n   - Sequence: `3` (row 2, column 4 → row 1, column 4), `5` (row 3, column 4 → row 2, column 4), `9` (row 4, column 4 → row 3, column 4), `2` (row 4, column 3 → row 4, column 4), `11` (row 4, column 2 → row 4, column 3), `8` (row 4, column 1 → row 4, column 2). Now the empty space is at (4,1).\n\n2. **Move the empty space up to (1,1) to align with tile 1:**  \n   - With the empty space at (4,1), move tiles 7 (row 3, column 1), 14 (row 2, column 1), and 15 (row 1, column 1) down to shift the empty space up to (1,1).  \n   - Sequence: `7` (row 3, column 1 → row 4, column 1), `14` (row 2, column 1 → row 3, column 1), `15` (row 1, column 1 → row 2, column 1). Now the empty space is at (1,1), adjacent to tile 1 at (1,2).\n\n3. **Move tile 1 left to (1,1) and down to (4,1):**  \n   - Tile 1 can now move left into the empty space at (1,1). Then, shift the empty space down column 1 to allow tile 1 to move down step-by-step.  \n   - Sequence: `1` (row 1, column 2 → row 1, column 1).

Moving 4 down to (3,2) shifts the empty space to (2,2).  \n5. **Move 6 left**: The empty space is at (2,2). The tile to the right is 6 at (2,3). Moving 6 left to (2,2) shifts the empty space to (2,3).  \n6. **Move 1 up**: The empty space is at (2,3). Tile 1 is at (3,3), adjacent to the empty space.
