The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER' (without quotes), where YOUR_ANSWER is your final answer to the question,e.g.'Answer: 15 3 4 2'\n\nThe goal of this game is to rearrange tiles into an n×n grid by moving a specified target tile to a target position. For example, if the input target is \"4 (2,1)\", you must move tile \"4\" to row 2, column 1 according to specific rules.\n\nRules:  \n- Grid positions are indexed starting from 1, with the top-left coordinate as (1,1).  \n- The puzzle consists of an n×n grid: n×n-1 numbered tiles and one empty space (represented by 0).  \n- A tile can only be moved into the empty space if it is directly adjacent to it (left, right, above, or below).  \n- Tiles cannot move diagonally. For example, in the following state, you cannot move tile \"7\" into the empty space:  \n  5 6 8  \n  7 2 3  \n  1 0 4  \n\n- Only one tile can be moved at each step.  \n- The puzzle is completed when the target tile reaches the target position.  \n- You must output your solution as a sequence of numbers separated by spaces. Each number indicates the tile moved into the empty space, following the above rules.
