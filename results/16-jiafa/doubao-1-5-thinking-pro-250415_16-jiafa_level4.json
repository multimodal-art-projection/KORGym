The symbols present are `\/`, `↑`, `♦`, and `→`. We assign variables to these symbols: let `\/ = a`, `↑ = b`, `♦ = c`, and `→ = d`. Using the row sums, we set up equations and solve for these variables.\n\n### Step 1: Set Up Equations\nEach row's sum is the sum of its symbols. For example, the first row `\/↑\/♦\/` has a sum of -85, leading to the equation \\(3a + b + c = -85\\). We derive similar equations for all rows:\n\n1. \\(3a + b + c = -85\\)\n2. \\(3a + c + d = -50\\)\n3. \\(a + 2b + 2c = -110\\)\n4. \\(3c + 2d = -77\\)\n5. \\(2c + 3d = 7\\)\n6. \\(a + 2b + 2d = 58\\)\n7. \\(c + 3b + d = -14\\)\n8. \\(b + 2c + 2d = -28\\)\n9. \\(c + 4d = 91\\)\n10. \\(a + 2b + c + d = -26\\)\n\n### Step 2: Solve for Variables\nWe solve these equations step-by-step. From equation 9 (\\(c + 4d = 91\\)), we express \\(c = 91 - 4d\\). Substituting \\(c\\) into equation 4 (\\(3c + 2d = -77\\)) gives \\(d = 35\\). Substituting \\(d = 35\\) back into \\(c = 91 - 4d\\) gives \\(c = -49\\). \n\nNext, using \\(c = -49\\) and \\(d = 35\\) in equation 8 (\\(b + 2c + 2d = -28\\)), we find \\(b = 0\\). Substituting \\(b = 0\\), \\(c = -49\\) into equation 3 (\\(a + 2b + 2c = -110\\)) gives \\(a = -12\\).\n\nThus, the values are:\n- `\/ = a = -12`\n- `↑ = b = 0`\n- `♦ = c = -49`\n- `→ = d = 35`\n\n### Step 3: Compute Column Sums\nWe replace each symbol in the grid with its numerical value and sum each column.

We are given the sum of each row, and we use these to derive the values of the symbols and then compute the column sums.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Symbols as Variables**: Each unique symbol (∏, $, ∆, ∅, ∵, +, ∫) is treated as a variable. Let these variables be \\(a, b, c, d, e, f, g\\) respectively.\n2. **Row Equations**: Each row sum provides an equation in terms of these variables. For example, the first row \"∏$∆∅∵∵+∵\" translates to \\(a + b + c + d + 3e + f = -178\\).\n3. **Solving the System of Equations**: By solving the system of linear equations derived from the row sums, we find the values of each symbol.\n4. **Column Sums**: Once the symbol values are known, we compute the sum of each column by summing the values of the symbols in that column across all rows.\n\n### Solving the Equations:\nWe derived 10 equations from the 10 rows and solved for the 7 variables. The solutions are:\n- \\(a = ∏ = -15\\)\n- \\(b = $ = -5\\)\n- \\(c = ∆ = -37\\)\n- \\(d = ∅ = 38\\)\n- \\(e = ∵ = -54\\)\n- \\(f = + = 3\\)\n- \\(g = ∫ = -36\\)\n\n### Calculating Column Sums:\nUsing the symbol values, we compute the sum of each column (8 columns total) by summing the values of the symbols in that column across all 10 rows.\n\n### Column Sums:\n- **Column 1**: Sum of the first element of each row: \\(-251\\)\n- **Column 2**: Sum of the second element of each row: \\(-75\\)\n- **Column 3**: Sum of the third element of each row: \\(-283\\)\n- **Column 4**: Sum of the fourth element of each row: \\(-66\\)\n- **Column 5**: Sum of the fifth element of each row: \\(-96\\)\n- **Column 6**: Sum of the sixth element of each row: \\(-233\\)\n- **Column 7**: Sum of the seventh element of each row: \\(-189\\)\n- **Column 8**: Sum of the eighth element of each row: \\(-56\\)\n\nAnswer: [-251, -75, -283, -66, -96, -233, -189, -56]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

For example, the first row is `\"-@@←≥←∆-\"`, which translates to \\( 2a + 2b + 2c + d + e = -505 \\). Similar equations are set up for all 7 rows.\n\n### Step 3: Solve the System of Equations\nUsing substitution and elimination, we solve the system of equations to find the values of \\( a, b, c, d, e, f \\):\n- \\( a = -98 \\)\n- \\( b = -70 \\)\n- \\( c = -82 \\)\n- \\( d = -28 \\)\n- \\( e = 23 \\)\n- \\( f = -71 \\)\n\n### Step 4: Compute Column Sums\nConvert each row into numerical values using the solved variables and sum the values in each column.\n\n### Column Sums Calculation:\n- **Column 1**: Sum of first elements of each row: \\( -98 + (-70) + 23 + (-70) + (-71) + (-28) + (-98) = -412 \\)\n- **Column 2**: Sum of second elements: \\( -70 + 23 + (-70) + (-98) + (-70) + (-70) + 23 = -332 \\)\n- **Column 3**: Sum of third elements: \\( -70 + 23 + (-82) + (-82) + (-70) + (-70) + (-98) = -449 \\)\n- **Column 4**: Sum of fourth elements: \\( -82 + (-70) + (-82) + (-71) + (-28) + (-98) + 23 = -408 \\)\n- **Column 5**: Sum of fifth elements: \\( -28 + (-71) + 23 + (-82) + (-70) + (-28) + (-70) = -326 \\)\n- **Column 6**: Sum of sixth elements: \\( -82 + (-82) + (-98) + (-82) + (-28) + (-82) + (-82) = -536 \\)\n- **Column 7**: Sum of seventh elements: \\( 23 + (-28) + (-98) + (-98) + (-70) + (-82) + 23 = -330 \\)\n- **Column 8**: Sum of eighth elements: \\( -98 + (-71) + (-98) + (-98) + (-70) + (-71) + (-71) = -577 \\)\n\nAnswer: [-412, -332, -449, -408, -326, -536, -330, -577]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.
