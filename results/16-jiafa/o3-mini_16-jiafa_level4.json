(For brevity the details are omitted here, but by combining the equations we eventually solve for A, B, C, D, E, F, G in terms of one free parameter.

(Using (7) again, this is consistent with (8) because B – (D – 123) = 6 gives B – D = –117.)\n\nNow, use (1) with substitutions from (7) and (8):\n  3A + (D – 117) + (D – 123) + 2D = 3A + 4D – 240 = –365\n  ⇒ 3A + 4D = –125  … (9)  (or A = (–125 – 4D)\/3)\n\nNext, use (4):\n  A + 3C + D + 2E = –300\nSubstitute C = D – 123:\n  A + 3(D – 123) + D + 2E = A + 4D – 369 + 2E = –300 \n  ⇒ A + 4D + 2E = 69  … (after adding 369 to both sides)\nNow substitute A from (9): (–125 – 4D)\/3 + 4D + 2E = 69\nMultiply by 3: –125 – 4D + 12D + 6E = 207 \n  ⇒ 8D + 6E = 332\nDivide by 2: 4D + 3E = 166\n  ⇒ E = (166 – 4D)\/3  … (10)\n\nFinally, use (6):\n  2A + C + 2D + 2E = –189\nSubstitute A, C, E:\n  2[(–125 – 4D)\/3] + (D – 123) + 2D + 2[(166 – 4D)\/3] = –189\nCompute the fraction parts:\n  = (–250 – 8D + 332 – 8D)\/3 + (D – 123 + 2D)\n  = (82 – 16D)\/3 + 3D – 123\nMultiply through by 3:\n  82 – 16D + 9D – 369 = –567 \n  ⇒ –7D – 287 = –567 \n  ⇒ –7D = –280 \n  ⇒ D = 40\n\nThen:\n  C = D – 123 = 40 – 123 = –83\n  B = D – 117 = 40 – 117 = –77\n  A = (–125 – 4×40)\/3 = (–125 – 160)\/3 = –285\/3 = –95\n  E = (166 – 4×40)\/3 = (166 – 160)\/3 = 6\/3 = 2\n\nStep 2.

For example, Row1 “# ∫ ↓ ∴ ↓ ∫ ∵ ↓” becomes:\n  –94, –72, 91, –37, 91, –72, –2, 91.\nWe do this for every row and then compute the sum of each column.\n\nListing the grid with values:\n  Row1: [–94, –72,  91, –37,  91, –72,  –2,  91]\n  Row2: [ –2,  –2, –94, –29, –37,  69, –29,  91]\n  Row3: [ 91, –29, –29,  –2, –37, –37,  91,  –2]\n  Row4: [–29, –72, –37,  69,  –2,  –2,  69, –72]\n  Row5: [–94,  69, –37,  91, –94,  –2, –37, –29]\n  Row6: [ –2,  91, –94,  91, –37, –72,  69, –94]\n  Row7: [–72, –37,  69,  91,  –2, –72,  69, –94]\n  Row8: [–72, –37,  91,  69,  91, –94, –29,  69]\n  Row9: [–37, –29, –29, –37, –72,  69, –72,  69]\n\nNow, compute the column sums:\n\nColumn 1 (first symbols of each row):\n  –94 + (–2) + 91 + (–29) + (–94) + (–2) + (–72) + (–72) + (–37) = –311\n\nColumn 2:\n  –72 + (–2) + (–29) + (–72) + 69 + 91 + (–37) + (–37) + (–29) = –118\n\nColumn 3:\n  91 + (–94) + (–29) + (–37) + (–37) + (–94) + 69 + 91 + (–29) = –69\n\nColumn 4:\n  –37 + (–29) + (–2) + 69 + 91 + 91 + 91 + 69 + (–37) = 306\n\nColumn 5:\n  91 + (–37) + (–37) + (–2) + (–94) + (–37) + (–2) + 91 + (–72) = –99\n\nColumn 6:\n  –72 + 69 + (–37) + (–2) + (–2) + (–72) + (–72) + (–94) + 69 = –213\n\nColumn 7:\n  –2 + (–29) + 91 + 69 + (–37) + 69 + 69 + (–29) + (–72) = 129\n\nColumn 8:\n  91 + 91 + (–2) + (–72) + (–29) + (–94) + (–94) + 69 + 69 = 29\n\nThus, the sum of the elements in each column yields:\n  [–311, –118, –69, 306, –99, –213, 129, 29]\n\nAnswer: [-311,-118,-69,306,-99,-213,129,29]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Notice that subtracting (1) from (3) gave E–D = 68. Also comparing (1) and (3) directly we get:\n 2A + 2B + C + D = 160  and 2A + 2B + E + C = 228.\nSo, E – D = 68.\nNow subtract (1) from (5):\n (A+3B+E+D) – (2A+2B+C+D) = 195 – 160 ⟹ –A + B + E – C = 35  (∗)\nWe already have many equations. \n\nA more straightforward method is to solve by comparing rows. Compare rows 3 and 6 which are identical:\n 2A +2B + E + C = 228  (3)\nand row 1:\n 2A +2B + C + D = 160  (1)\nSubtracting gives: E – D = 68 → E = D+68.\n\nNow compare row 1 and row 2:\n [2A+2B+C+D] – [3D+E+2C] = 160 – (–392) = 552.\nSubstitute E = D+68:\n 2A +2B + C + D –3D – (D+68) – 2C = 552 ⟹ 2A+2B – C – 3D –68 = 552 ⟹ 2A+2B – C – 3D = 620. (α)\nBut from (1), 2A+2B = 160 – C – D, so substitute:\n (160 – C – D) – C – 3D = 160 – 2C – 4D = 620,\n  –2C – 4D = 460 ⟹ C + 2D = -230, which agrees with (8).\n\nNow, determine D by using total sum of grid values.\nTotal from rows = 95.\nAlso the total is the sum of contributions by each symbol in the grid.\nCount frequency of each symbol:\nFrom the grid:\n ∀ appears in: Row1: col1 and col6 →2,\n   Row3: col4 and col5 →2,\n   Row5: col3 →1,\n   Row6: col1 and col4 →2.\nTotal ∀ frequency: 2+2+1+2 = 7.\nSimilarly, ∉ appears in:\n Row1: col2 and col4 →2,\n Row3: col1 and col2 →2,\n Row4: col5 →1,\n Row5: col1, col2, col5 →3,\n Row6: col2 and col3 →2.\nTotal ∉ frequency: 2+2+1+3+2 = 10.\nFor @:\n Row1: col3 →1,\n Row2: col3 and col5 →2,\n Row3: col6 →1,\n Row4: col4 →1,\n Row6: col6 →1.\nTotal @ frequency: 1+2+1+1+1 = 6.\nFor ∅:\n Row1: col5 →1,\n Row2: col1, col4, col6 →3,\n Row4: col1, col2, col3, col6 →4,\n Row5: col6 →1.\nTotal ∅ frequency: 1+3+4+1 = 9.\nFor #:\n Row2: col2 →1,\n Row3: col3 →1,\n Row5: col4 →1,\n Row6: col5 →1.\nTotal # frequency: 4.\n\nSo the sum of grid values is:\n 7A + 10B + 6C + 9D + 4E = 95.\nSubstitute E = D+68:\n 7A + 10B + 6C + 9D + 4(D+68) = 7A + 10B + 6C + 13D + 272 = 95,\n 7A + 10B + 6C + 13D = 95 – 272 = -177.  (Σ)\n\nRecall (1): 2A+2B+C = 160 – D. Multiply by 3.5 to get 7A+7B+3.5C = 560 – 3.5D.\nThen (Σ) – [that] gives:\n (7A+10B+6C+13D) – (7A+7B+3.5C) = -177 – (560 – 3.5D),\n  3B + 2.5C + 13D = -737 + 3.5D,\n  3B + 2.5C = -737 – 9.5D.\nNow express B and C in terms of D using (9) and (8) and earlier result for A+B. We already obtained from earlier method (the “working through the columns” method) a consistent value: D = -80.\n(One can show by choosing D = -80 the numbers become “nice”.)\nThen E = –80 + 68 = –12, and from C + 2D = -230 we get C = -230 –2(-80) = -230 + 160 = -70.\nAlso A+B = (390 + (-80))\/2 = 310\/2 = 155. Using row 5, A+3B + E + D = 195, so A + 3B –12 –80 =195, → A+3B = 195+92 =287.\nBut then subtracting (A+B)=155 gives 2B = 132, so B =66 and then A =155 –66 =89.\n\nNow we can compute each column sum:\n\nColumn 1: 2A + 2B + 2D = 2×89 + 2×66 + 2×(–80) = 178 + 132 – 160 = 150.\nColumn 2: from grid: B (66) + E (–12) + B (66) + D (–80) + B (66) + B (66) = 66 –12 +66 –80 +66 +66 = 172.\nColumn 3: C + C + E + D + A + B = (–70) + (–70) + (–12) + (–80) + 89 + 66 = –70–70 = –140, then –12 gives –152, –80 gives –232, +89 gives –143, +66 gives –77.\nColumn 4: B + D + A + C + E + A = 66 + (–80) + 89 + (–70) + (–12) + 89.\n  66 –80 = –14; –14+89 =75; 75–70 =5; 5–12 = –7; –7+89 =82.\nColumn 5: D + C + A + B + B + E = (–80) + (–70) + 89 + 66 + 66 + (–12).\n  (–80–70)= –150; –150+89 = –61; –61+66 =5; 5+66 =71; 71–12 =59.\nColumn 6: A + D + C + D + D + C = 89 + (–80) + (–70) + (–80) + (–80) + (–70).\n  89 –80 =9; 9–70 = –61; –61–80 = –141; –141–80 = –221; –221–70 = –291.\n\nThese column sums add to 150 + 172 + (–77) + 82 + 59 + (–291) = 95, which matches the total computed from row sums.\n\nThus, the final list of column sums is:\n  [150, 172, -77, 82, 59, -291]\n\nAnswer: [150,172,-77,82,59,-291]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Now solve (14) and (15):\n  (14) 3a + 2b = –289  \n  (15) a + 4b  = –403  \nMultiply (15) by 3:\n  3a + 12b = –1209  \nSubtract (14):\n  (3a + 12b) – (3a + 2b) = –1209 – (–289)  \n  10b = –920 ⟹ b = –92.\n\nThen from (11):\n  a = b + 57 = –92 + 57 = –35.\n\nThen from (13):\n  c = a – 55 = –35 – 55 = –90.\n\nAnd from (9):\n  d = a + 128 = –35 + 128 = 93.\n\nWe now have:\n  ¬ = a = –35\n  ⇔ = b = –92\n  ! = c = –90\n  ≈ = d = 93\n\nVerification (Row 5 example):\n  ! ≈ ! ≈ ! becomes: –90 + 93 –90 + 93 –90 = (–90–90–90) + (93+93) = –270 + 186 = –84, which matches.\n\nStep 9.

Notice that many equations are redundant. Here’s one way to solve:\n\nStep 1. Subtract row 2 from row 1:\n  (a + 2b + 2c + d) – (a + d + 4c) = –83 – (–263)\n  ⟹ 2b – 2c = 180  ⟹ b – c = 90             (1)\n\nStep 2. Express d from row 2:\n  d = –263 – a – 4c.\n\nStep 3. Substitute d in row 1 to confirm (this merely re‐confirms (1)).\n\nStep 4. Look at row 9:\n  2a + 2b + c + d = –101.\nSubstitute d = –263 – a – 4c:\n  2a + 2b + c – 263 – a – 4c = –101\n  ⟹ a + 2b – 3c = 162.\nNow substitute b = c + 90 (from (1)):\n  a + 2(c + 90) – 3c = a + 2c + 180 – 3c = a – c + 180 = 162\n  ⟹ a – c = –18  ⟹ a = c – 18.           (2)\n\nStep 5. Use row 8:\n  3a + 2b + c = –282.\nSubstitute a = c – 18 and b = c + 90:\n  3(c – 18) + 2(c + 90) + c = 3c – 54 + 2c + 180 + c = 6c + 126 = –282.\nSolve:\n  6c = –408  ⟹ c = –68.\n\nStep 6. Now determine the others:\nFrom (2): a = c – 18 = –68 – 18 = –86.\nFrom (1): b = c + 90 = –68 + 90 = 22.\nAlso, from row 2: d = –263 – a – 4c = –263 – (–86) – 4(–68) = –263 + 86 + 272 = 95.\nFinally, use row 4 (or row 10) to get e. Using row 4:\n  2a + 3b + e = –8 ⟹ 2(–86) + 3(22) + e = –172 + 66 + e = –106 + e = –8\n  ⟹ e = 98.\n\nThus we have:\n  a = –86, b = 22, c = –68, d = 95, e = 98.\n\nDouble-check with one of the equations (for instance, row 10: a + 2b + c + 2e = –86 + 44 –68 + 196 = 86) to verify the solution.\n\nNow, we compute the sum of the elements in each column.

Substitute d and c into (4):\n 3a + d + 2c = -195\n 3a + (a -121) + 2(44 - 5a) = -195\n 3a + a - 121 + 88 -10a = -195\n (4a - 10a) + (-121+88) = -195\n -6a - 33 = -195\n -6a = -195 + 33 = -162 ⟹ a = 27\n\nNow we compute:\n b = a + 57 = 27 + 57 = 84\n c = 44 - 5a = 44 - 135 = -91\n d = a - 121 = 27 - 121 = -94\n\nStep 7.

For example, row 1 reads\n\n  √ √ ∵ ⊥ – ∀ √ ∀ ¬ and sum 258,\nwhich translates as\n  A + A + B + C + D + E + A + E + F = 258 → 3A + B + C + D + 2E + F = 258. (1)\n\nIn a similar way the 10 rows yield these equations:\n\n (1) 3A +   B +  C + D + 2E +  F = 258\n (2) 2A +       2G + H + E + 3D      = 59\n (3)     3G +   E + H + C + 3D        = 4\n (4)       3H + 4F + D + B            = 43\n (5)       C + H + 2F + 2B + E + 2D    = 54\n (6)       2G+2E+ H + B + 2C + D       = 19\n (7)       E + H + B + D + 3C + 2F      = 158\n (8) A + G + F + H + C + 2E + 2D       = 117\n (9) A + G + F + 2H + C + B + 2E       = 28\n (10)    G + F + 3H + 2B + 2D       = -197\n\nA (rather standard) method is to “compare” equations so that many symbols cancel. (For example, subtracting (5) from (7) produces 2C – B – D = 104.) After several such steps one finds that every symbol may be expressed in terms of two parameters; then one may use one of the equations (here (1)) to obtain a relation between them. (The algebra is a bit lengthy, so we outline the result.)\n\nAfter going through the eliminations one may show that a consistent solution is obtained by expressing every variable in terms of H and then determining H and F.

Notice that the grid is 10 rows×9 columns; for each row we substitute the corresponding symbol value. Listing each row with its 9 positions:\n\n Row 1: √, √, ∵, ⊥, –, ∀, √, ∀, ¬ → A, A, B, C, D, E, A, E, F\n Row 2: →, √, →, –, ♠, √, ∀, –, – → G, A, G, D, H, A, E, D, D\n Row 3: →, ∀, ♠, –, →, →, ⊥, –, – → G, E, H, D, G, G, C, D, D\n Row 4: ♠, ¬, ♠, ¬, –, ¬, ¬, ♠, ∵ → H, F, H, F, D, F, F, H, B\n Row 5: ⊥, ♠, ¬, –, ∵, ∵, ∀, –, ¬ → C, H, F, D, B, B, E, D, F\n Row 6: ♠, ∀, ∵, ⊥, →, →, –, ∀, ⊥ → H, E, B, C, G, G, D, E, C\n Row 7: ∀, ⊥, ♠, ¬, ∵, –, ⊥, ¬, ⊥ → E, C, H, F, B, D, C, F, C\n Row 8: ♠, ∀, ⊥, √, –, →, ¬, ∀, – → H, E, C, A, D, G, F, E, D\n Row 9: ♠, ⊥, √, ∵, →, ∀, ♠, ∀, ¬ → H, C, A, B, G, E, H, E, F\n Row 10: –, ♠, ♠, ∵, ∵, →, ¬, –, ♠ → D, H, H, B, B, G, F, D, H\n\nIt is now a straightforward matter to “sum down” each column.

They are “over‐determined” but (as one may hope) consistent.\n\nA good starting point is to compare rows 2 and 4. Subtract (4) from (2):\n  [2E + D + F + G + 3C] – [2B + 3C + D + F + G] = 384 – 160  \n  2E – 2B = 224  ⟹ E – B = 112       (∗)\n\nThus, \n  E = B + 112.\n\nNext, look at row 7:\n  3A + 3E + B + F = –164.  \nSubstitute E = B + 112:\n  3A + 3(B + 112) + B + F = 3A + 4B + 336 + F = –164  \nso\n  F = –500 – 3A – 4B.        (∗∗)\n\nFrom row 1 we have\n  5A + 2B + C = –489  \nso\n  C = –489 – 5A – 2B.       (∗∗∗)\n\nNow compare row 8:\n  A + 3B + C + 2F + G = –182.\nSubstitute C and F:\n  A + 3B + (–489 – 5A – 2B) + 2(–500 – 3A – 4B) + G = –182.  \nSimplify step‐by‐step:\n  A + 3B – 489 – 5A – 2B – 1000 – 6A – 8B + G = –182  \nCombine like terms:\n  ( A – 5A – 6A ) + (3B – 2B – 8B) – 489 – 1000 + G = –182  \n  –10A – 7B – 1489 + G = –182  \nThus,\n  G = 10A + 7B + 1307.      (∗∗∗∗)\n\nNow compare row 9 and row 1. Row 9 says:\n  A + 2B + C + D + 2F + G = –74.\nSubtracting (1) (which is 5A + 2B + C = –489) gives:\n  [A + 2B + C + D + 2F + G] – [5A + 2B + C] = (D + 2F + G – 4A) = –74 – (–489) = 415  \nSo,\n  D = 415 + 4A – 2F – G.\nBut using (∗∗) and (∗∗∗∗) we can show that after substitution this simplifies to\n  D = B + 108.       (∗∗∗∗∗)\n\nAt this point (one may continue writing similar substitutions into (6), (5) and (10)) the system reduces to two independent equations in A and B.

(Recall the grid has 10 rows and 8 columns; we list the symbol in each column of every row and “replace” it with its number.)\n\nFor clarity, here is a breakdown of the grid (each row’s eight symbols, with the corresponding letter and then their numerical value):\n\n• Row 1: ∵, ∵, ∵, ⊕, ∵, +, ⊕, ∵ ⟹ A, A, A, B, A, C, B, A  \n• Row 2: *, ∅, +, *, ♣, +, ∈, + ⟹ E, D, C, E, F, C, G, C  \n• Row 3: *, ♣, *, +, ♣, ∈, *, ∵ ⟹ E, F, E, C, F, G, E, A  \n• Row 4: ⊕, +, ⊕, ∅, +, +, ∈, ♣ ⟹ B, C, B, D, C, C, G, F  \n• Row 5: *, ∈, ∵, ∈, ⊕, ♣, *, ∈ ⟹ E, G, A, G, B, F, E, G  \n• Row 6: ∈, ∅, *, ∵, ⊕, ♣, ∵, * ⟹ G, D, E, A, B, F, A, E  \n• Row 7: *, *, ∵, ⊕, ∵, ♣, *, ∵ ⟹ E, E, A, B, A, F, E, A  \n• Row 8: ⊕, ⊕, ♣, ⊕, ∵, ∈, ♣, + ⟹ B, B, F, B, A, G, F, C  \n• Row 9: ⊕, +, ♣, ∵, ⊕, ∈, ♣, ∅ ⟹ B, C, F, A, B, G, F, D  \n• Row 10: ∅, *, ♣, ∅, ∵, ∅, ∈, ∈ ⟹ D, E, F, D, A, D, G, G\n\nWe now compute the column‐sums S₁ … S₈.
