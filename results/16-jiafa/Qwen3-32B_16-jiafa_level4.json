      "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the column sums based on the given grid and row sums. First, I should probably assign numerical values to each symbol. The grid has symbols like ⊕, -, ♠, &, and others. Each row's total is provided, so maybe I can set up equations for each row and solve for the symbols.\n\nLet me start by listing out each row and their symbols. Let me note down each row's symbols and their sum.\n\nRow 1: ⊕ - ⊕ ♠ ♠ → Sum is 137. Wait, how many symbols are there? Let me count. The first row is \"⊕-⊕♠♠\". Let me split that into individual elements. Let's see: positions 1 to 5? Let me parse each character:\n\nAssuming each row has 5 elements. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 1: ⊕, -, ⊕, ♠, ♠ → sum is 137.\n\nRow 2: &, ♠, &, -, - → sum is 125.\n\nRow 3: &, ♠, &, ♠, ♠ → sum is 93.\n\nRow 4: ⊕, ⊕, ⊕, ⊕, - → sum is -17.\n\nRow 5: ⊕, &, ⊕, ⊕, & → sum is -138.\n\nSo each row has 5 elements. Now, I need to assign variables to each symbol. Let me assign:\n\nLet me define variables:\n\nLet’s say:\n\nLet’s denote:\n\n⊕ = A\n\n- = B\n\n♠ = C\n\n& = D\n\nSo each symbol corresponds to a variable. Now, I can write equations for each row.\n\nRow 1: A + B + A + C + C = 137 → 2A + B + 2C = 137.\n\nRow 2: D + C + D + B + B = 125 → 2D + C + 2B = 125.\n\nRow 3: D + C + D + C + C = 93 → 2D + 3C = 93.\n\nRow 4: A + A + A + A + B = -17 → 4A + B = -17.\n\nRow 5: A + D + A + A + D = -138 → 3A + 2D = -138.\n\nNow, I need to solve these equations to find the values of A, B, C, D. Once I have those, I can compute the column sums.\n\nLet me start with the equations.\n\nEquation 4: 4A + B = -17 → B = -17 -4A.\n\nEquation 5: 3A + 2D = -138 → Let me solve for D in terms of A. 2D = -138 -3A → D = (-138 -3A)/2.\n\nEquation 3: 2D + 3C = 93. Let me plug D here once I have D in terms of A. But maybe I can find another equation involving C and D.\n\nEquation 2: 2D + C + 2B = 125. Since B is in terms of A, and D is in terms of A, maybe I can substitute.\n\nEquation 1: 2A + B + 2C = 137. Again, substitute B and solve for C.\n\nThis seems manageable. Let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, from equation 4: B = -17 -4A.\n\nFrom equation 5: D = (-138 -3A)/2.\n\nNow, let's substitute D into equation 3 to find C.\n\nEquation 3: 2D + 3C = 93.\n\nSubstituting D:\n\n2*[(-138 -3A)/2] + 3C = 93 → (-138 -3A) + 3C = 93 → -3A + 3C = 93 + 138 → -3A +3C = 231 → divide both sides by 3: -A + C = 77 → C = A +77.\n\nSo C is A +77. Let me note that.\n\nNow, let's substitute B and D into equation 2: 2D + C + 2B = 125.\n\nSubstituting D and B:\n\n2*[(-138 -3A)/2] + C + 2*(-17 -4A) = 125.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(-138 -3A) + C + (-34 -8A) = 125.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-138 -3A -34 -8A + C = 125 → -172 -11A + C = 125.\n\nBut from earlier, C = A +77. Substitute that:\n\n-172 -11A + (A +77) = 125 → -172 +77 -11A +A = 125 → (-95) -10A = 125 → -10A = 125 +95 → -10A = 220 → A = -22.\n\nSo A is -22. Now, let's find other variables.\n\nFrom equation 4: B = -17 -4A = -17 -4*(-22) = -17 +88 = 71.\n\nFrom equation 5: D = (-138 -3A)/2. Plugging A=-22:\n\nD = (-138 -3*(-22))/2 = (-138 +66)/2 = (-72)/2 = -36.\n\nFrom C = A +77 → C = -22 +77 = 55.\n\nSo now we have:\n\nA (⊕) = -22\n\nB (-) = 71\n\nC (♠) = 55\n\nD (&) = -36\n\nLet me verify these values with the equations.\n\nCheck equation 1: 2A + B + 2C = 2*(-22) +71 +2*55 = -44 +71 +110 = (-44) + 181 = 137. Correct.\n\nEquation 2: 2D + C + 2B = 2*(-36) +55 +2*(71) = -72 +55 +142 = (-72 +197) = 125. Correct.\n\nEquation 3: 2D +3C = 2*(-36) +3*55 = -72 +165 = 93. Correct.\n\nEquation 4: 4A + B = 4*(-22) +71 = -88 +71 = -17. Correct.\n\nEquation 5: 3A +2D = 3*(-22) +2*(-36) = -66 -72 = -138. Correct. All equations are satisfied.\n\nNow, with the values of each symbol, I need to compute the column sums. The grid has 5 columns. Let me reconstruct each column's elements.\n\nOriginal grid rows:\n\nRow 1: [⊕, -, ⊕, ♠, ♠] → positions 1: A, 2: B, 3: A, 4: C, 5: C\n\nRow 2: [&, ♠, &, -, -] → D, C, D, B, B\n\nRow 3: [&, ♠, &, ♠, ♠] → D, C, D, C, C\n\nRow 4: [⊕, ⊕, ⊕, ⊕, -] → A, A, A, A, B\n\nRow 5: [⊕, &, ⊕, ⊕, &] → A, D, A, A, D\n\nNow, columns are:\n\nColumn 1: Row1: A, Row2: D, Row3: D, Row4: A, Row5: A.\n\nSo column 1 sum: A + D + D + A + A = 3A + 2D.\n\nWait, let me list each column:\n\nColumn 1 (first element of each row):\n\nRow1: A\n\nRow2: D\n\nRow3: D\n\nRow4: A\n\nRow5: A\n\nSo column 1: A + D + D + A + A = 3A + 2D.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow1: B\n\nRow2: C\n\nRow3: C\n\nRow4: A\n\nRow5: D\n\nSum: B + C + C + A + D.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow1: A\n\nRow2: D\n\nRow3: D\n\nRow4: A\n\nRow5: A\n\nSame as column 1? Let me check:\n\nRow1: third element is A (third symbol in row 1 is ⊕)\n\nRow2: third element is D (third symbol is &)\n\nRow3: third element is D\n\nRow4: third element is A (third ⊕)\n\nRow5: third element is A (third symbol is ⊕)\n\nSo column 3 sum: A + D + D + A + A = same as column 1: 3A + 2D.\n\nWait, but column 1 and 3 have same sum? Let me check again.\n\nYes, column 1 and column 3 have same elements? No. Wait:\n\nWait column 1 is first element of each row.\n\nColumn 3 is third element of each row.\n\nFor row 1: first element is A, third is A.\n\nRow 2: first is D, third is D.\n\nRow3: same. Row4: first is A, third is A. Row5: first is A, third is A. So yes, column 1 and column 3 have the same elements, so same sum.\n\nBut let me proceed.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nRow1: C (fourth element)\n\nRow2: B (fourth element)\n\nRow3: C (fourth element)\n\nRow4: A (fourth element)\n\nRow5: A (fourth element)\n\nSo column 4 sum: C + B + C + A + A = 2C + B + 2A.\n\nColumn 5:\n\nRow1: C (fifth element)\n\nRow2: B (fifth element)\n\nRow3: C (fifth element)\n\nRow4: B (fifth element)\n\nRow5: D (fifth element)\n\nSum: C + B + C + B + D = 2C + 2B + D.\n\nNow, compute each column sum using the known values of A, B, C, D.\n\nLet me compute each column:\n\nColumn 1: 3A + 2D.\n\nA = -22, D = -36.\n\nSo 3*(-22) + 2*(-36) = -66 -72 = -138.\n\nColumn 2: B + C + C + A + D → B + 2C + A + D.\n\nValues:\n\nB=71, C=55, A=-22, D=-36.\n\nSo 71 + 2*55 + (-22) + (-36) = 71 + 110 -22 -36 = (71 + 110) = 181, minus 58 = 123.\n\nColumn 3: same as column 1: 3A + 2D = -138.\n\nColumn 4: 2C + B + 2A → 2*55 +71 + 2*(-22) = 110 +71 -44 = 181 -44 = 137.\n\nColumn 5: 2C + 2B + D → 2*55 + 2*71 + (-36) = 110 + 142 -36 = 252 -36 = 216.\n\nWait, let me verify each calculation again step by step.\n\nFor column 1: 3A + 2D:\n\nA is -22. 3*(-22) is -66. D is -36. 2*(-36) is -72. Total: -66-72 = -138. Correct.\n\nColumn 2: B (71) + C (55) + C (55) + A (-22) + D (-36). So 71 +55+55 is 71+110=181. Then minus 22 and minus 36: 181 -22=159, 159-36=123. Correct.\n\nColumn 3 same as column 1: -138. Correct.\n\nColumn 4: C (55) + B (71) + C (55) + A (-22) + A (-22). So 55 +71 +55 is 55+55=110 +71=181. Then -22-22= -44. Total 181-44=137. Correct.\n\nColumn 5: C (55) + B (71) + C (55) + B (71) + D (-36). So 55+71+55+71 = (55+55) + (71+71) = 110 + 142 = 252. Then minus 36: 252-36=216. Correct.\n\nSo the column sums are:\n\nColumn 1: -138\n\nColumn 2: 123\n\nColumn 3: -138\n\nColumn 4: 137\n\nColumn 5: 216\n\nTherefore, the answer should be a list of these column sums in order: [-138, 123, -138, 137, 216]\n\nWait, but let me check once more. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the columns.\n\nOriginal columns:\n\nColumn 1: first elements: A, D, D, A, A → sum -138.\n\nColumn 2: second elements: B, C, C, A, D → sum 123.\n\nColumn 3: third elements: A, D, D, A, A → same as column 1, sum -138.\n\nColumn 4: fourth elements: C, B, C, A, A → sum 137.\n\nColumn 5: fifth elements: C, B, C, B, D → sum 216.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the list is [-138, 123, -138, 137, 216].\n\nBut let me cross-validate with another approach. For example, the total sum of all rows should equal the total sum of all columns. Let me check.\n\nSum of all rows: 137 + 125 +93 + (-17) + (-138) = Let's calculate:\n\n137 +125 = 262; 262 +93 = 355; 355 -17 = 338; 338 -138 = 200.\n\nSum of columns: -138 +123 + (-138) +137 +216 = Let's compute:\n\nStart adding:\n\n-138 +123 = -15\n\n-15 -138 = -153\n\n-153 +137 = -16\n\n-16 +216 = 200. Which matches the total row sum. So that's a good check. Therefore, the column sums are correct.\n\nSo the final answer is the list of column sums in order: [-138, 123, -138, 137, 216].\n ;Answer: [-138, 123, -138, 137, 216]"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the sum of each column based on the given grid and row sums. First, I should probably assign variables to each unique symbol to represent their numerical values. The symbols here are √, ∆, ♣, and ←. Wait, wait, looking at the grid, each row has these symbols arranged in a certain pattern, and each row's total sum is provided. My job is to find the column sums once all the symbols' values are determined.\n\nSo, first step: Assign variables to each symbol. Let me note them down. Let's say:\n\nLet’s denote:\n- √ as A\n- ∆ as B\n- ♣ as C\n- ← as D\n\nNow, each row in the grid is a sequence of these symbols followed by their row sum. For example, the first row is √∆∆←∆ with sum 157. Translating that into variables: A + B + B + D + B = 157. Which simplifies to A + 3B + D = 157.\n\nI need to create equations for each row. Let's go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: √∆∆←∆ → A + B + B + D + B = A + 3B + D = 157 → Equation 1: A + 3B + D = 157\n\nRow 2: √♣√←♣ → A + C + A + D + C = 2A + 2C + D = -126 → Equation 2: 2A + 2C + D = -126\n\nRow 3: ∆←√∆← → B + D + A + B + D = A + 2B + 2D = -12 → Equation 3: A + 2B + 2D = -12\n\nRow 4: ∆√∆√← → B + A + B + A + D = 2A + 2B + D = 138 → Equation 4: 2A + 2B + D = 138\n\nRow 5: ♣∆←←♣ → C + B + D + D + C = 2C + B + 2D = -257 → Equation 5: B + 2C + 2D = -257\n\nRow 6: ∆√♣←∆ → B + A + C + D + B = A + C + 2B + D = 25 → Equation 6: A + C + 2B + D = 25\n\nRow 7: ♣√∆∆← → C + A + B + B + D = A + C + 2B + D = 25 → Wait, same as Equation 6? Let me check. The seventh row is ♣√∆∆←, which is C + A + B + B + D → A + C + 2B + D. Yes, same as row 6. So that gives Equation 7 same as Equation 6. So maybe there's a typo? Or perhaps not. Let me check again. Row 6's sum is 25, row 7's sum is 25. So equations 6 and 7 are the same. So perhaps we have redundant equations here.\n\nRow 8: ←♣←∆∆ → D + C + D + B + B = 2D + C + 2B = -125 → Equation 8: 2B + C + 2D = -125\n\nRow 9: ♣√√♣♣ → C + A + A + C + C = 2A + 3C = -89 → Equation 9: 2A + 3C = -89\n\nSo now we have 9 equations, but some are redundant. Let me list them again:\n\nEquation 1: A + 3B + D = 157  \nEquation 2: 2A + 2C + D = -126  \nEquation 3: A + 2B + 2D = -12  \nEquation 4: 2A + 2B + D = 138  \nEquation 5: B + 2C + 2D = -257  \nEquation 6: A + C + 2B + D = 25  \nEquation 7: same as 6  \nEquation 8: 2B + C + 2D = -125  \nEquation 9: 2A + 3C = -89  \n\nHmm. Let me try solving these equations step by step. Let me see which equations can be used to eliminate variables.\n\nFirst, perhaps I can subtract equations to eliminate variables. Let's start with Equations 1 and 4. Equation 1 is A + 3B + D = 157. Equation 4 is 2A + 2B + D = 138. If I subtract Equation 1 from Equation 4, I get:\n\n(2A + 2B + D) - (A + 3B + D) = 138 - 157  \nWhich simplifies to A - B = -19 → A = B - 19. Let me note that as Equation 10: A = B - 19.\n\nNow, let's use Equation 10 in other equations. Let's take Equation 3: A + 2B + 2D = -12. Substitute A with B - 19:\n\n(B - 19) + 2B + 2D = -12 → 3B -19 + 2D = -12 → 3B + 2D = 7 → Equation 11: 3B + 2D = 7.\n\nSimilarly, Equation 4: 2A + 2B + D = 138. Substitute A = B -19:\n\n2(B -19) + 2B + D = 138 → 2B -38 + 2B + D = 138 → 4B + D = 176 → Equation 12: 4B + D = 176.\n\nNow, from Equation 12, D = 176 - 4B. Let's substitute D into Equation 11.\n\nEquation 11: 3B + 2D = 7 → 3B + 2*(176 -4B) =7 → 3B + 352 -8B =7 → -5B +352=7 → -5B = 7-352= -345 → B= (-345)/(-5) = 69. So B=69.\n\nNow that we have B=69, we can find A and D. From Equation 10: A = B -19 = 69 -19 = 50. So A=50.\n\nFrom Equation 12: D = 176 -4B = 176 -4*69 = 176 - 276 = -100. So D=-100.\n\nSo now we have A=50, B=69, D=-100. Now need to find C.\n\nLet's use Equation 2: 2A + 2C + D = -126. Substitute A=50, D=-100:\n\n2*50 + 2C + (-100) = -126 → 100 -100 + 2C = -126 → 0 + 2C = -126 → 2C = -126 → C = -63.\n\nLet me check if this value of C works with other equations. Let's check Equation 9: 2A + 3C = -89. Substitute A=50, C=-63:\n\n2*50 + 3*(-63) = 100 -189 = -89. Yes! That's correct. So C=-63.\n\nNow check other equations to make sure. Let's check Equation 5: B + 2C + 2D = -257. Substitute B=69, C=-63, D=-100:\n\n69 + 2*(-63) + 2*(-100) = 69 -126 -200 = 69 - 326 = -257. Correct.\n\nEquation 6: A + C + 2B + D = 25. Substitute:\n\n50 + (-63) + 2*69 + (-100) = 50 -63 +138 -100 = (50 +138) - (63 +100) = 188 - 163 = 25. Correct.\n\nEquation 8: 2B + C + 2D = -125 → 2*69 + (-63) + 2*(-100) = 138 -63 -200 = (138-63) -200 = 75 -200 = -125. Correct.\n\nSo all equations are satisfied. Great! Now that we have all the values:\n\nA (√) = 50  \nB (∆) = 69  \nC (♣) = -63  \nD (←) = -100  \n\nNow, the next step is to compute the column sums. The grid has columns 1 through 5 (since each row has 5 symbols). Let's look at each column in the grid and sum the values.\n\nFirst, let's write down each column's symbols. Let's list each row's symbols and then extract each column.\n\nThe grid is:\n\nRow 1: √ ∆ ∆ ← ∆  \nRow 2: √ ♣ √ ← ♣  \nRow 3: ∆ ← √ ∆ ←  \nRow 4: ∆ √ ∆ √ ←  \nRow 5: ♣ ∆ ← ← ♣  \nRow 6: ∆ √ ♣ ← ∆  \nRow 7: ♣ √ ∆ ∆ ←  \nRow 8: ← ♣ ← ∆ ∆  \nRow 9: ♣ √ √ ♣ ♣  \n\nNow, let's extract each column:\n\nColumn 1 (first symbol of each row):\nRow1: √  \nRow2: √  \nRow3: ∆  \nRow4: ∆  \nRow5: ♣  \nRow6: ∆  \nRow7: ♣  \nRow8: ←  \nRow9: ♣  \n\nColumn 2 (second symbol):\nRow1: ∆  \nRow2: ♣  \nRow3: ←  \nRow4: √  \nRow5: ∆  \nRow6: √  \nRow7: √  \nRow8: ♣  \nRow9: √  \n\nColumn 3 (third symbol):\nRow1: ∆  \nRow2: √  \nRow3: √  \nRow4: ∆  \nRow5: ←  \nRow6: ♣  \nRow7: ∆  \nRow8: ←  \nRow9: √  \n\nColumn 4 (fourth symbol):\nRow1: ←  \nRow2: ←  \nRow3: ∆  \nRow4: √  \nRow5: ←  \nRow6: ←  \nRow7: ∆  \nRow8: ∆  \nRow9: ♣  \n\nColumn 5 (fifth symbol):\nRow1: ∆  \nRow2: ♣  \nRow3: ←  \nRow4: ←  \nRow5: ♣  \nRow6: ∆  \nRow7: ←  \nRow8: ∆  \nRow9: ♣  \n\nNow, for each column, replace the symbols with their numerical values and sum them.\n\nLet's compute each column step by step.\n\nColumn 1:\n√, √, ∆, ∆, ♣, ∆, ♣, ←, ♣  \nValues: 50, 50, 69, 69, -63, 69, -63, -100, -63  \nSum them:\n\nLet me add them one by one:\n\nStart with 0.\n\nAdd 50 → 50  \nAdd 50 → 100  \nAdd 69 → 169  \nAdd 69 → 238  \nAdd -63 → 175  \nAdd 69 → 244  \nAdd -63 → 181  \nAdd -100 → 81  \nAdd -63 → 18  \n\nSo Column 1 sum is 18?\n\nWait, let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in addition.\n\nLet me list all the numbers again for Column 1:\n\n50, 50, 69, 69, -63, 69, -63, -100, -63.\n\nLet me group them:\n\n50 + 50 = 100  \n69 + 69 = 138  \n-63 + 69 = 6  \n-63 -100 -63 = -226  \n\nSo total sum: 100 + 138 + 6 -226 = (100+138) = 238 +6=244 -226=18. Yes, 18. So Column 1 sum is 18.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nSymbols: ∆, ♣, ←, √, ∆, √, √, ♣, √  \nValues: 69, -63, -100, 50, 69, 50, 50, -63, 50.\n\nLet me add these:\n\nStart with 0.\n\n69 → 69  \n-63 → 6  \n-100 → -94  \n+50 → -44  \n+69 → 25  \n+50 → 75  \n+50 → 125  \n-63 → 62  \n+50 → 112.\n\nSo Column 2 sum is 112?\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\n69 -63 = 6  \n6 -100 = -94  \n-94 +50 = -44  \n-44 +69 = 25  \n25 +50 = 75  \n75 +50 = 125  \n125 -63 = 62  \n62 +50 = 112.

      "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have a grid of symbols and the sums of each row. Our job is to figure out the column sums. Hmm, first, I need to understand what each symbol represents numerically. Let me start by assigning variables to each unique symbol. \n\nLooking at the grid, the symbols are: ∝, ⊙, ↓, +, x. Wait, but in the first row, there's also a '+' and 'x'? Let me check again. The first row is ∝⊙⊙++⊙ with sum -407. The second is ∝⊙↓+⊙↓ -187, and so on. So the symbols are ∝, ⊙, ↓, +, and x. Wait, but the problem says each symbol represents a numerical value. So each unique symbol is a variable. Let me list all the unique symbols:\n\nSymbols: ∝, ⊙, ↓, +, x. So five different symbols. Each has a value. Our goal is to find the column sums once we know all the symbols' values.\n\nBut how do we find the values of each symbol? Since each row's sum is given, we can set up equations for each row and solve the system of equations. Once we have the values for each symbol, we can compute the column sums.\n\nFirst, let's note that each row has six elements. Let's index the columns from 0 to 5 (assuming zero-based). Wait, the grid rows have six symbols each. Let me confirm:\n\nLooking at the first row: ∝⊙⊙++⊙ → that's six symbols. Let me count:\n\n1. ∝\n2. ⊙\n3. ⊙\n4. +\n5. +\n6. ⊙ → yes, six elements. Each row has six symbols. So there are six columns. The output should be a list of six numbers, each being the sum of the column.\n\nSo first step: create equations for each row based on the symbols and their counts. Let me assign variables:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet A = value of ∝\n\nB = value of ⊙\n\nC = value of ↓\n\nD = value of +\n\nE = value of x\n\nNow, each row is an equation. For example, the first row has symbols: A, B, B, D, D, B. Sum is A + B + B + D + D + B = A + 3B + 2D = -407.\n\nSimilarly, for each row, I can write an equation. Let's do that for all rows.\n\nRow 1: ∝⊙⊙++⊙ → A + 3B + 2D = -407\n\nRow 2: ∝⊙↓+⊙↓ → A, B, C, D, B, C → A + B + C + D + B + C = A + 2B + 2C + D = -187\n\nRow 3: ⊙∝↓⊙↓↓ → B, A, C, B, C, C → B + A + C + B + C + C = A + 2B + 3C = -72\n\nRow 4: +⊙∝⊙↓∝ → D, B, A, B, C, A → D + B + A + B + C + A = 2A + 2B + C + D = -223\n\nRow 5: x+∝↓⊙↓ → E, D, A, C, B, C → E + D + A + C + B + C = A + B + D + E + 2C = -62\n\nRow 6: x↓∝⊙↓↓ → E, C, A, B, C, C → E + C + A + B + C + C = A + B + E + 3C = 53\n\nRow 7: ∝x⊙↓⊙↓ → A, E, B, C, B, C → A + E + B + C + B + C = A + E + 2B + 2C = -52\n\nSo now we have seven equations with five variables. Wait, five variables (A, B, C, D, E) and seven equations. That's overdetermined. But maybe there's a unique solution. Let's see if the equations are consistent.\n\nLet me list all equations:\n\n1. A + 3B + 2D = -407 → Eq1\n\n2. A + 2B + D + 2C = -187 → Eq2 (since A + 2B + 2C + D = -187)\n\nWait, no: the second equation is A + 2B + D + 2C? Let me recheck. The second row is ∝⊙↓+⊙↓ → symbols are A, B, C, D, B, C. Sum is A + B + C + D + B + C = A + 2B + D + 2C = -187. Yes. So Eq2: A + 2B + D + 2C = -187.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nEq3: A + 2B + 3C = -72.\n\nEq4: 2A + 2B + C + D = -223.\n\nEq5: A + B + D + E + 2C = -62.\n\nEq6: A + B + E + 3C = 53.\n\nEq7: A + E + 2B + 2C = -52.\n\nSo variables A, B, C, D, E.\n\nWe need to solve this system. Let's see how to approach. Since there are more equations than variables, we can pick five equations and solve, then check consistency with others.\n\nLet me try to find relations between equations. Maybe express variables in terms of others.\n\nFirst, let's look at equations that don't involve E. Equations 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nLet me focus on equations 1-4 first. Let's write them again:\n\nEq1: A + 3B + 2D = -407\n\nEq2: A + 2B + D + 2C = -187\n\nEq3: A + 2B + 3C = -72\n\nEq4: 2A + 2B + C + D = -223\n\nLet me see if we can solve for A, B, C, D first, then use equations 5-7 for E.\n\nLet me try to eliminate variables. For example, from Eq3 and Eq2, perhaps we can eliminate some variables.\n\nLet me first take Eq3: A + 2B + 3C = -72 → Let's call this Eq3.\n\nFrom Eq2: A + 2B + D + 2C = -187 → Let's subtract Eq3 from Eq2:\n\n(Eq2 - Eq3): (A + 2B + D + 2C) - (A + 2B + 3C) ) = D - C = (-187) - (-72) = -187 +72 = -115 → D - C = -115 → D = C - 115 → Eq2-3.\n\nSo D = C - 115. Let's note that.\n\nNow, let's look at Eq1: A + 3B + 2D = -407. Since D = C - 115, substitute into Eq1:\n\nA + 3B + 2*(C - 115) = -407 → A + 3B + 2C - 230 = -407 → A + 3B + 2C = -407 + 230 = -177 → A + 3B + 2C = -177 → Let's call this Eq1'.\n\nNow, let's look at Eq4: 2A + 2B + C + D = -223. Again, substitute D = C - 115:\n\n2A + 2B + C + (C - 115) = -223 → 2A + 2B + 2C - 115 = -223 → 2A + 2B + 2C = -223 + 115 = -108 → Divide both sides by 2: A + B + C = -54 → Let's call this Eq4'.\n\nNow, we have:\n\nEq1': A + 3B + 2C = -177\n\nEq3: A + 2B + 3C = -72\n\nEq4': A + B + C = -54\n\nLet me try to solve these three equations. Let me denote them as:\n\nEquation (i): A + 3B + 2C = -177\n\nEquation (ii): A + 2B + 3C = -72\n\nEquation (iii): A + B + C = -54\n\nLet me subtract equation (iii) from equation (i):\n\n(i) - (iii): (A + 3B + 2C) - (A + B + C) = 2B + C = -177 - (-54) = -123 → 2B + C = -123 → Equation (iv)\n\nSimilarly, subtract equation (iii) from equation (ii):\n\n(ii) - (iii): (A + 2B + 3C) - (A + B + C) = B + 2C = -72 - (-54) = -18 → B + 2C = -18 → Equation (v)\n\nNow we have:\n\nEquation (iv): 2B + C = -123\n\nEquation (v): B + 2C = -18\n\nLet me solve these two equations. Let's use substitution or elimination. Let's multiply equation (v) by 2: 2B + 4C = -36. Then subtract equation (iv):\n\n(2B +4C) - (2B + C) = 3C = -36 - (-123) = 87 → 3C = 87 → C = 29.\n\nThen substitute C=29 into equation (v): B + 2*29 = -18 → B +58 = -18 → B = -76.\n\nNow that we have B and C, we can find A from equation (iii): A + B + C = -54 → A = -54 - B - C = -54 - (-76) -29 = -54 +76 -29 = (76-54) -29 = 22 -29 = -7. So A = -7.\n\nNow, D can be found from D = C -115 = 29 - 115 = -86.\n\nSo far, we have:\n\nA = -7 (value of ∝)\n\nB = -76 (value of ⊙)\n\nC = 29 (value of ↓)\n\nD = -86 (value of +)\n\nNow, let's check these values in the equations to make sure.\n\nCheck Eq3: A + 2B + 3C = -7 + 2*(-76) + 3*29 = -7 -152 +87 = (-159) +87 = -72. Correct.\n\nCheck Eq1': A +3B +2C = -7 +3*(-76) +2*29 = -7 -228 +58 = (-235) +58 = -177. Correct.\n\nCheck Eq4': A + B + C = -7 + (-76) +29 = (-83) +29 = -54. Correct.\n\nNow, let's check Eq2: A + 2B + D + 2C = -7 + 2*(-76) + (-86) + 2*29 = -7 -152 -86 +58 = (-7-152) is -159; -159-86 is -245; +58 → -187. Which matches the given row sum of -187. Correct.\n\nNow, moving on to equations involving E (equations 5, 6, 7). Let's use these to find E.\n\nEquation 5: A + B + D + E + 2C = -62\n\nWe have A=-7, B=-76, D=-86, C=29. Let's plug in:\n\n-7 + (-76) + (-86) + E + 2*29 = ?\n\nCalculate step by step:\n\n-7 -76 = -83; -83 -86 = -169; -169 + E + 58 (since 2*29=58). So total is -169 +58 + E = -111 + E. This equals -62 → -111 + E = -62 → E = -62 +111 = 49. So E=49.\n\nCheck equation 6: A + B + E + 3C = 53.\n\nA + B + E + 3C = -7 + (-76) +49 + 3*29 = -7-76 is -83 +49 = -34 + 87 (since 3*29=87) → -34 +87=53. Correct.\n\nEquation 7: A + E + 2B + 2C = -52.\n\nA + E + 2B + 2C = -7 +49 + 2*(-76) +2*29 = 42 -152 +58 = (42 +58) -152 = 100 -152 = -52. Correct. So all equations are satisfied. Great!\n\nSo now we have all the values:\n\n∝ = A = -7\n\n⊙ = B = -76\n\n↓ = C = 29\n\n+ = D = -86\n\nx = E = 49\n\nNow, the next step is to compute the column sums. The grid has six columns. Let's reconstruct each column's symbols and compute their sum.\n\nFirst, let's list each row's symbols in columns 0-5:\n\nRow 1: [∝, ⊙, ⊙, +, +, ⊙] → columns 0: ∝, 1:⊙, 2:⊙, 3:+, 4:+, 5:⊙\n\nRow 2: [∝, ⊙, ↓, +, ⊙, ↓] → columns 0: ∝, 1:⊙, 2:↓, 3:+, 4:⊙, 5:↓\n\nRow 3: [⊙, ∝, ↓, ⊙, ↓, ↓] → columns 0:⊙, 1:∝, 2:↓, 3:⊙, 4:↓, 5:↓\n\nRow 4: [+, ⊙, ∝, ⊙, ↓, ∝] → columns 0:+, 1:⊙, 2:∝, 3:⊙, 4:↓, 5:∝\n\nRow 5: [x, +, ∝, ↓, ⊙, ↓] → columns 0:x, 1:+, 2:∝, 3:↓, 4:⊙, 5:↓\n\nRow 6: [x, ↓, ∝, ⊙, ↓, ↓] → columns 0:x, 1:↓, 2:∝, 3:⊙, 4:↓, 5:↓\n\nRow 7: [∝, x, ⊙, ↓, ⊙, ↓] → columns 0:∝, 1:x, 2:⊙, 3:↓, 4:⊙, 5:↓\n\nNow, for each column (0 to 5), collect all symbols in that column, replace them with their numerical values, sum them up.\n\nLet me create a list for each column:\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow1: ∝ (-7)\n\nRow2: ∝ (-7)\n\nRow3: ⊙ (-76)\n\nRow4: + (-86)\n\nRow5: x (49)\n\nRow6: x (49)\n\nRow7: ∝ (-7)\n\nTotal for column 0: (-7) + (-7) + (-76) + (-86) + 49 +49 + (-7) \n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nStart with 0.\n\nAdd -7 → -7\n\nAdd -7 → -14\n\nAdd -76 → -90\n\nAdd -86 → -176\n\nAdd 49 → -127\n\nAdd 49 → -78\n\nAdd -7 → -85.\n\nSo column 0 sum is -85.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow1: ⊙ (-76)\n\nRow2: ⊙ (-76)\n\nRow3: ∝ (-7)\n\nRow4: ⊙ (-76)\n\nRow5: + (-86)\n\nRow6: ↓ (29)\n\nRow7: x (49)\n\nSum:\n\n-76 + (-76) + (-7) + (-76) + (-86) + 29 +49 \n\nLet me compute:\n\nStart with 0.\n\n-76 → -76\n\n-76 → -152\n\n-7 → -159\n\n-76 → -235\n\n-86 → -321\n\n+29 → -292\n\n+49 → -243. \n\nSo column 1 sum is -243.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow1: ⊙ (-76)\n\nRow2: ↓ (29)\n\nRow3: ↓ (29)\n\nRow4: ∝ (-7)\n\nRow5: ∝ (-7)\n\nRow6: ∝ (-7)\n\nRow7: ⊙ (-76)\n\nSum:\n\n-76 +29 +29 + (-7) + (-7) + (-7) + (-76)\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n-76 +29 = -47\n\n+29 → -18\n\n-7 → -25\n\n-7 → -32\n\n-7 → -39\n\n-76 → -115. \n\nSo column 2 sum is -115.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow1: + (-86)\n\nRow2: + (-86)\n\nRow3: ⊙ (-76)\n\nRow4: ⊙ (-76)\n\nRow5: ↓ (29)\n\nRow6: ⊙ (-76)\n\nRow7: ↓ (29)\n\nSum:\n\n-86 + (-86) + (-76) + (-76) +29 + (-76) +29 \n\nLet's calculate:\n\nStart with 0.\n\n-86 → -86\n\n-86 → -172\n\n-76 → -248\n\n-76 → -324\n\n+29 → -295\n\n-76 → -371\n\n+29 → -342. \n\nColumn 3 sum is -342.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nRow1: + (-86)\n\nRow2: ⊙ (-76)\n\nRow3: ↓ (29)\n\nRow4: ↓ (29)\n\nRow5: ⊙ (-76)\n\nRow6: ↓ (29)\n\nRow7: ⊙ (-76)\n\nSum:\n\n-86 + (-76) +29 +29 + (-76) +29 + (-76)\n\nLet me compute:\n\nStart with 0.\n\n-86 → -86\n\n-76 → -162\n\n+29 → -133\n\n+29 → -104\n\n-76 → -180\n\n+29 → -151\n\n-76 → -227.\n\nColumn 4 sum is -227.\n\nColumn 5:\n\nRow1: ⊙ (-76)\n\nRow2: ↓ (29)\n\nRow3: ↓ (29)\n\nRow4: ∝ (-7)\n\nRow5: ↓ (29)\n\nRow6: ↓ (29)\n\nRow7: ↓ (29)\n\nSum:\n\n-76 +29 +29 + (-7) +29 +29 +29 \n\nCompute step by step:\n\nStart with 0.\n\n-76 → -76\n\n+29 → -47\n\n+29 → -18\n\n-7 → -25\n\n+29 → 4\n\n+29 → 33\n\n+29 → 62.\n\nWait, that's a positive sum?

Since each row's sum is provided, maybe I can set up equations based on the symbols in each row and their counts. Let me think.\n\nLet me list out the symbols present. Looking at the grid:\n\nRow 1: ∴⊗∴∴∴∴∴ → symbols are ∴ and ⊗. Let's count how many of each. Let's see:\n\nRow 1: The first symbol is ∴, then ⊗, then ∴ four more times? Wait, let me count each row's symbols properly.\n\nRow 1: ∴⊗∴∴∴∴∴ → Let's break it down. Let's count each symbol in each row.\n\nRow 1: The symbols are ∴, ⊗, ∴, ∴, ∴, ∴, ∴. Wait, that's 1 ⊗ and 6 ∴s? Wait, the first symbol is ∴, then ⊗, then five more ∴s? Let me count:\n\nRow 1: [∴, ⊗, ∴, ∴, ∴, ∴, ∴]. So total symbols per row? Each row seems to have 7 symbols. Let me check:\n\nYes, each row has 7 symbols. Let me count each row's symbols:\n\nRow 1: ∴, ⊗, ∴, ∴, ∴, ∴, ∴ → 6 ∴ and 1 ⊗.\n\nRow 2: √, %, ∴, ⊗, ∴, %, ⊗ → Let's count each symbol here. √:1, %:2, ∴:2, ⊗:2.\n\nRow 3: $, √, ∴, ∴, ∴, ⊗, $ → symbols: $:2, √:1, ∴:3, ⊗:1.\n\nRow 4: ⊗, ⊗, ∴, √, ∴, ⊗, ⊗ → symbols: ⊗:4, ∴:2, √:1.\n\nRow 5: $, %, ⊗, ∴, √, %, √ → symbols: $:1, %:2, ⊗:1, ∴:1, √:2.\n\nRow 6: %, √, ⊗, √, ⊗, ∴, % → symbols: %:2, √:2, ⊗:2, ∴:1.\n\nSo each row has 7 symbols, and each row's total is given. Let's denote each symbol's value as variables:\n\nLet me assign variables:\n\nLet’s say:\n\nA = ∴\n\nB = ⊗\n\nC = √\n\nD = %\n\nE = $\n\nNow, each row can be represented as an equation based on the count of symbols.\n\nRow 1: 6A + 1B = 95\n\nRow 2: 2A + 2B + 1C + 2D = -277? Wait, no. Wait Row 2's symbols are √, %, ∴, ⊗, ∴, %, ⊗. So symbols are:\n\n√ (C), % (D), ∴ (A), ⊗ (B), ∴ (A), % (D), ⊗ (B). So counts:\n\nC:1, D:2, A:2, B:2. So equation: C + 2D + 2A + 2B = -277.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nLet me write all equations:\n\nRow 1: 6A + B = 95 → Equation 1\n\nRow 2: 2A + 2B + C + 2D = -277 → Equation 2\n\nRow 3: 3A + B + C + 2E = -113 → Wait Row 3 is $√∴∴∴⊗$ → symbols are $ (E), √ (C), ∴ (A), ∴ (A), ∴ (A), ⊗ (B), $ (E). So counts: E:2, C:1, A:3, B:1. So equation: 2E + C + 3A + B = -113 → Equation 3.\n\nRow 4: ⊗⊗∴√∴⊗⊗ → symbols are B, B, A, C, A, B, B → counts: B:4, A:2, C:1. Equation: 4B + 2A + C = -305 → Equation 4.\n\nRow 5: $%⊗∴√%√ → symbols E, D, B, A, C, D, C → counts: E:1, D:2, B:1, A:1, C:2. Equation: E + D*2 + B + A + C*2 = -311 → Equation 5.\n\nRow 6: %√⊗√⊗∴% → symbols D, C, B, C, B, A, D → counts: D:2, C:2, B:2, A:1. Equation: 2D + 2C + 2B + A = -353 → Equation 6.\n\nNow, we have 6 equations with 5 variables (A, B, C, D, E). Wait, but there are 5 variables? Let me check again. The symbols are ∴ (A), ⊗ (B), √ (C), % (D), $ (E). So 5 variables. But 6 equations. Hmm, that might be overdetermined, but maybe there's a solution.\n\nLet me write all equations again:\n\nEquation 1: 6A + B = 95 → (1)\n\nEquation 2: 2A + 2B + C + 2D = -277 → (2)\n\nEquation 3: 3A + B + C + 2E = -113 → (3)\n\nEquation 4: 4B + 2A + C = -305 → (4)\n\nEquation 5: E + 2D + B + A + 2C = -311 → (5)\n\nEquation 6: A + 2B + 2C + 2D = -353 → (6)\n\nNow, let's try solving these equations step by step.\n\nFirst, from Equation 1: B = 95 - 6A. Let's substitute B in other equations.\n\nEquation 4: 4B + 2A + C = -305. Substitute B:\n\n4*(95 -6A) + 2A + C = -305\n\nCalculate 4*95 = 380, 4*(-6A) = -24A. So:\n\n380 -24A + 2A + C = -305 → 380 -22A + C = -305 → C = -305 -380 +22A → C = -685 +22A → Equation 4a.\n\nNow, Equation 2: 2A + 2B + C + 2D = -277. Substitute B and C.\n\nFirst, B = 95 -6A. C is -685 +22A.\n\nSo:\n\n2A + 2*(95 -6A) + (-685 +22A) + 2D = -277\n\nCompute each term:\n\n2A + 190 -12A -685 +22A + 2D = -277\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(2A -12A +22A) + (190 -685) + 2D = -277\n\n(12A) + (-495) + 2D = -277 → 12A + 2D = -277 + 495 → 12A + 2D = 218 → Divide both sides by 2: 6A + D = 109 → Equation 2a: D = 109 -6A.\n\nNow, Equation 6: A + 2B + 2C + 2D = -353. Substitute B, C, D.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nA + 2*(95-6A) + 2*(-685 +22A) + 2D = -353.\n\nCompute:\n\nA + 190 -12A + (-1370 +44A) + 2D = -353.\n\nCombine terms:\n\nA -12A +44A + 190 -1370 + 2D = -353 → 33A -1180 + 2D = -353 → 33A + 2D = -353 + 1180 = 827 → Equation 6a: 33A + 2D = 827.\n\nBut from Equation 2a, D = 109 -6A. Substitute into 6a:\n\n33A + 2*(109 -6A) = 827 → 33A + 218 -12A = 827 → 21A = 827 -218 = 609 → A = 609 /21 = 29. Let me check that division: 21*29 is 609? 21*30=630, minus 21 is 609. Yes. So A=29.\n\nNow that we have A=29, let's find B from Equation 1:\n\nB = 95 -6A = 95 -6*29 = 95 - 174 = -79.\n\nThen, from Equation 4a: C = -685 +22A = -685 +22*29. Let's compute 22*29: 20*29=580, 2*29=58 → total 638. So C = -685 +638 = -47.\n\nFrom Equation 2a: D = 109 -6A = 109 -6*29 = 109 -174 = -65.\n\nNow, we need to find E. Let's use Equation 3: 3A + B + C + 2E = -113.\n\nSubstitute A=29, B=-79, C=-47:\n\n3*29 = 87; B is -79; C is -47. So total so far: 87 -79 -47 = (87-79) -47 = 8 -47 = -39. So equation becomes -39 + 2E = -113 → 2E = -113 +39 = -74 → E = -37.\n\nNow check if these values satisfy other equations. Let's check Equation 5: E + 2D + B + A + 2C = -311.\n\nSubstituting:\n\nE = -37, D=-65, B=-79, A=29, C=-47.\n\nCompute:\n\n-37 + 2*(-65) + (-79) +29 + 2*(-47) \n\nCalculate step by step:\n\n-37 -130 -79 +29 -94 \n\nAdding up:\n\nStart with -37 -130 = -167; -167 -79 = -246; -246 +29 = -217; -217 -94 = -311. Which matches Equation 5's RHS of -311. Good.\n\nNow check Equation 6: A + 2B + 2C + 2D = -353.\n\nA=29, 2B=2*(-79)=-158, 2C=2*(-47)=-94, 2D=2*(-65)=-130.\n\nTotal: 29 -158 -94 -130 = 29 - (158+94+130) = 29 - 382 = -353. Correct.\n\nNow check Equation 2: 2A + 2B + C + 2D = ?\n\n2A = 58, 2B = -158, C=-47, 2D=-130. Sum: 58 -158 -47 -130 = 58 - (158+47+130) = 58 - 335 = -277. Which matches Equation 2. Good.\n\nSo all equations are satisfied. Now we have the values:\n\nA (∴) = 29\n\nB (⊗) = -79\n\nC (√) = -47\n\nD (%) = -65\n\nE ($) = -37\n\nNow, the task is to compute the sum of each column. The grid has 7 columns. Let me reconstruct the grid with symbols and replace each with their values.\n\nOriginal grid:\n\nRow 1: ∴⊗∴∴∴∴∴ → symbols are [∴, ⊗, ∴, ∴, ∴, ∴, ∴]\n\nRow 2: √%∴⊗∴%⊗ → [√, %, ∴, ⊗, ∴, %, ⊗]\n\nRow 3: $√∴∴∴⊗$ → [$, √, ∴, ∴, ∴, ⊗, $]\n\nRow 4: ⊗⊗∴√∴⊗⊗ → [⊗, ⊗, ∴, √, ∴, ⊗, ⊗]\n\nRow 5: $%⊗∴√%√ → [$, %, ⊗, ∴, √, %, √]\n\nRow 6: %√⊗√⊗∴% → [%, √, ⊗, √, ⊗, ∴, %]\n\nNow, let's list each column's symbols and compute their sum.\n\nLet me index columns from 0 to 6 (assuming 0-based).

Which matches the total row sum. So that's a good check.\n\nTherefore, the column sums are correct.

      "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have a grid with symbols in each row, and each row has a sum provided. Our task is to find the sum of each column and output that as a list. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the numerical values of each unique symbol. The symbols in the grid are ⊙, *, ∵, ^, ⇔. Let's note all of them. Each row has these symbols and a total sum. So maybe I can set up equations for each row where the sum of the symbols equals the given row total. Then solve the system of equations to find the value of each symbol.\n\nLet me list out each row with their symbols and their sum. Let's count the symbols per row. Wait, the grid is given as rows, each with symbols followed by their sum. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 1: ⊙ * ∵ ^ ^ ⊙ ⊙ → sum -365\nRow 2: ∵ * ⊙ ∵ * ⊙ ⊙ → sum -605\nRow 3: ∵ ∵ ⊙ ⊙ ⊙ * ^ → sum -488\nRow 4: ⊙ ⇔ ^ ∵ ∵ ∵ ⇔ → sum -300\nRow 5: ⊙ * ^ ⊙ * ⊙ ^ → sum -359\nRow 6: ⊙ ^ ∵ ⇔ ⇔ ^ ⊙ → sum -189\n\nEach row has 7 symbols except maybe row 4 and 6. Wait, let me check:\n\nRow 1: Let's count the symbols. The first row is ⊙, *, ∵, ^, ^, ⊙, ⊙ → 7 symbols. Sum is -365.\n\nRow 2: ∵, *, ⊙, ∵, *, ⊙, ⊙ → 7 symbols. Sum -605.\n\nRow 3: ∵, ∵, ⊙, ⊙, ⊙, *, ^ → 7 symbols. Sum -488.\n\nRow 4: ⊙, ⇔, ^, ∵, ∵, ∵, ⇔ → 7 symbols. Sum -300.\n\nRow 5: ⊙, *, ^, ⊙, *, ⊙, ^ → 7 symbols. Sum -359.\n\nRow 6: ⊙, ^, ∵, ⇔, ⇔, ^, ⊙ → 7 symbols. Sum -189.\n\nSo each row has 7 symbols. Now, we need to assign variables to each unique symbol. Let me assign variables:\n\nLet’s denote:\n\nLet A = ⊙\n\nB = *\n\nC = ∵\n\nD = ^\n\nE = ⇔\n\nNow, we can rewrite each row in terms of these variables:\n\nRow 1: A + B + C + D + D + A + A = 3A + B + C + 2D = -365\n\nRow 2: C + B + A + C + B + A + A = 3A + 2B + 2C = -605\n\nRow 3: C + C + A + A + A + B + D = 3A + B + 2C + D = -488\n\nRow 4: A + E + D + C + C + C + E = A + 2E + D + 3C = -300\n\nRow 5: A + B + D + A + B + A + D = 3A + 2B + 2D = -359\n\nRow 6: A + D + C + E + E + D + A = 2A + 2D + C + 2E = -189\n\nNow, we have 6 equations with 5 variables. Wait, that's more equations than variables, so there might be redundant equations. Let me write them down:\n\nEquation 1: 3A + B + C + 2D = -365\n\nEquation 2: 3A + 2B + 2C = -605\n\nEquation 3: 3A + B + 2C + D = -488\n\nEquation 4: A + 3C + 2E + D = -300\n\nEquation 5: 3A + 2B + 2D = -359\n\nEquation 6: 2A + C + 2D + 2E = -189\n\nHmm. Let's see. Let me try to solve these equations step by step.\n\nFirst, perhaps we can find relations between variables by subtracting equations or using substitution.\n\nLet me start with Equations 2 and 5. Both involve 3A and 2B terms.\n\nEquation 2: 3A + 2B + 2C = -605\n\nEquation 5: 3A + 2B + 2D = -359\n\nIf we subtract Equation 5 from Equation 2, we get:\n\n(3A + 2B + 2C) - (3A + 2B + 2D) = (-605) - (-359)\n\nSimplifies to:\n\n2C - 2D = -246 → divide both sides by 2: C - D = -124 → C = D -124. Let's note this as Equation 7.\n\nNow, Equation 7: C = D -124.\n\nNow, let's see if we can use Equation 1 and 3. Let me look at Equation 1 and 3.\n\nEquation 1: 3A + B + C + 2D = -365\n\nEquation 3: 3A + B + 2C + D = -488\n\nIf we subtract Equation 1 from Equation 3:\n\n(3A + B + 2C + D) - (3A + B + C + 2D) = -488 - (-365)\n\nSimplifies to: (2C + D) - (C + 2D) = -123 → C - D = -123\n\nWait, from Equation 7, we had C - D = -124. But here, we get C - D = -123. That's a contradiction. Wait, that can't be. Did I do the math right?\n\nLet me check again.\n\nEquation 3 minus Equation 1:\n\nLeft side:\n\n3A + B + 2C + D\n\nminus\n\n3A + B + C + 2D\n\n= (3A -3A) + (B - B) + (2C - C) + (D - 2D) = 0 + 0 + C - D.\n\nSo the left side is C - D.\n\nRight side: -488 - (-365) = -488 + 365 = -123.\n\nThus, C - D = -123. But earlier from Equations 2 and 5, we had C - D = -124. Contradiction? That suggests that there's an inconsistency in the equations. But that can't be possible. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equations?\n\nLet me check the equations again.\n\nEquation 1: 3A + B + C + 2D = -365.\n\nEquation 3: 3A + B + 2C + D = -488.\n\nYes, that's correct. So subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 3 gives C - D = -123. But Equation 7 from Equations 2 and 5 gives C - D = -124. So that's a problem. This implies that there's no solution unless I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup of the equations. Let me re-examine the rows.\n\nRow 1: symbols are ⊙ * ∵ ^ ^ ⊙ ⊙ → So that's A, B, C, D, D, A, A. Sum is 3A (since there are three A's: positions 1, 6, 7?), wait:\n\nWait, positions:\n\nFirst symbol: A (⊙)\n\nSecond: B (*)\n\nThird: C (∵)\n\nFourth: D (^)\n\nFifth: D (^)\n\nSixth: A (⊙)\n\nSeventh: A (⊙)\n\nSo total A's: 1 + 6 + 7 → three A's (positions 1, 6, 7). So yes, 3A. Then B (once), C (once), D twice. So equation 1: 3A + B + C + 2D = -365. Correct.\n\nEquation 2: Row 2: ∵ * ⊙ ∵ * ⊙ ⊙ → C, B, A, C, B, A, A. So variables: C + B + A + C + B + A + A = 3A + 2B + 2C. Sum is -605. Correct.\n\nEquation 3: Row 3: ∵ ∵ ⊙ ⊙ ⊙ * ^ → C, C, A, A, A, B, D. So that's 3A + 2C + B + D. Sum -488. Correct.\n\nSo equation 3 is 3A + B + 2C + D = -488. Yes. So equation 3 minus equation 1 gives (3A + B + 2C + D) - (3A + B + C + 2D) = (2C + D) - (C + 2D) = C - D. Which equals -488 - (-365) = -123. So C - D = -123. But from equation 2 and 5, we had C - D = -124. Contradiction. That suggests that there's an inconsistency in the equations. But that's impossible because the problem must have a solution. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in setting up the equations. Let me check equation 5 again.\n\nEquation 5: Row 5: ⊙ * ^ ⊙ * ⊙ ^ → symbols are A, B, D, A, B, A, D. So variables: A + B + D + A + B + A + D = 3A + 2B + 2D. Sum is -359. Correct. So equation 5 is 3A + 2B + 2D = -359.\n\nEquation 2: 3A + 2B + 2C = -605.\n\nSubtract equation 5 from equation 2: (3A + 2B + 2C) - (3A + 2B + 2D) = -605 - (-359) → 2C - 2D = -246 → C - D = -123. Wait! Wait, earlier I thought that from equations 2 and 5, I had C - D = -124. But that's not correct. Wait, -605 - (-359) is -605 + 359 = -246. Then 2C - 2D = -246 → divide by 2: C - D = -123. Which matches the result from equation 3 minus equation 1. So I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought that equation 7 was C - D = -124. No, it's -123. So my mistake was in the previous calculation. So now, both equations give C - D = -123. So that's consistent. So Equation 7 is C = D -123.\n\nOkay, that's fixed. So now, moving forward.\n\nSo Equation 7: C = D -123.\n\nNow, let's proceed.\n\nLet me try to find other equations. Let's take Equation 1 and Equation 3 again. Since we have C in terms of D, perhaps we can substitute into other equations.\n\nLet me start with Equation 1: 3A + B + C + 2D = -365. Substitute C = D -123:\n\n3A + B + (D -123) + 2D = -365 → 3A + B + 3D -123 = -365 → 3A + B + 3D = -365 + 123 = -242. Let's call this Equation 1a: 3A + B + 3D = -242.\n\nEquation 3: 3A + B + 2C + D = -488. Substitute C = D -123:\n\n3A + B + 2*(D -123) + D = -488 → 3A + B + 2D -246 + D = -488 → 3A + B + 3D -246 = -488 → 3A + B + 3D = -488 + 246 = -242. So Equation 3 becomes the same as Equation 1a. So that's consistent. So Equations 1 and 3 are redundant once we substitute C = D -123. So we can move on.\n\nNow, let's look at Equation 5: 3A + 2B + 2D = -359. And Equation 2: 3A + 2B + 2C = -605. Since C = D -123, substitute into Equation 2:\n\n3A + 2B + 2*(D -123) = -605 → 3A + 2B + 2D - 246 = -605 → 3A + 2B + 2D = -605 + 246 = -359. Wait, but Equation 5 is 3A + 2B + 2D = -359. So Equation 2 and 5 are now the same. So that's redundant. So Equations 2 and 5 are the same once we substitute C = D -123. So now, we have Equations 1a and 5 (which are same as Equations 1 and 2/5). So we need more equations.\n\nNow, let's look at Equation 3, which we already handled. Let's move to other equations.\n\nLet me consider Equation 4 and Equation 6, which involve E.\n\nEquation 4: A + 3C + D + 2E = -300. (Wait, original equation 4: A + 3C + D + 2E = -300?)\n\nWait, original equation 4: A + E + D + 3C + E = A + D + 3C + 2E = -300. Yes. So Equation 4: A + 3C + D + 2E = -300.\n\nEquation 6: 2A + C + 2D + 2E = -189.\n\nWe can substitute C = D -123 into these equations.\n\nLet's do that.\n\nEquation 4 becomes:\n\nA + 3*(D -123) + D + 2E = -300 → A + 3D - 369 + D + 2E = -300 → A + 4D + 2E = -300 + 369 → A + 4D + 2E = 69. Let's call this Equation 4a.\n\nEquation 6 becomes:\n\n2A + (D -123) + 2D + 2E = -189 → 2A + D -123 + 2D + 2E = -189 → 2A + 3D + 2E = -189 + 123 → 2A + 3D + 2E = -66. Let's call this Equation 6a.\n\nNow, we have Equations 4a and 6a:\n\nEquation 4a: A + 4D + 2E = 69\n\nEquation 6a: 2A + 3D + 2E = -66\n\nIf we subtract Equation 4a from Equation 6a:\n\n(2A + 3D + 2E) - (A + 4D + 2E) = -66 - 69 → (A - D) = -135 → A - D = -135 → A = D -135. Let's note this as Equation 8.\n\nSo Equation 8: A = D -135.\n\nNow, we can use this in Equation 1a: 3A + B + 3D = -242.\n\nSubstituting A = D -135 into Equation 1a:\n\n3*(D -135) + B + 3D = -242 → 3D - 405 + B + 3D = -242 → 6D + B - 405 = -242 → 6D + B = -242 + 405 = 163 → B = 163 -6D. Let's call this Equation 9.\n\nNow, Equation 5 is 3A + 2B + 2D = -359. Let's substitute A and B in terms of D.\n\nA = D -135, B = 163 -6D.\n\nSo:\n\n3*(D -135) + 2*(163 -6D) + 2D = -359.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n3D - 405 + 326 -12D + 2D = -359.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(3D -12D +2D) + (-405 + 326) = -359 → (-7D) + (-79) = -359 → -7D = -359 +79 → -7D = -280 → D = (-280)/(-7) = 40.\n\nSo D = 40.\n\nNow, let's find other variables:\n\nFrom Equation 8: A = D -135 → A = 40 -135 = -95.\n\nFrom Equation 7: C = D -123 → C = 40 -123 = -83.\n\nFrom Equation 9: B = 163 -6D → B = 163 -6*40 = 163 -240 = -77.\n\nNow, we can find E from Equation 4a: A +4D +2E =69.\n\nSubstituting A=-95, D=40:\n\n-95 +4*40 +2E =69 → -95 +160 +2E =69 → 65 +2E =69 → 2E=4 → E=2.\n\nCheck with Equation 6a: 2A +3D +2E = -66.\n\n2*(-95) +3*40 +2*2 = -190 +120 +4 = -66. Yes, correct.\n\nSo now, all variables are:\n\nA (⊙) = -95\n\nB (*) = -77\n\nC (∵) = -83\n\nD (^) = 40\n\nE (⇔) = 2\n\nNow, with these values, we can compute each column's sum. The grid has 7 columns. Let me list each column's symbols and compute their sum.\n\nFirst, we need to know the symbols in each column. The grid is:\n\nRow 1: ⊙ * ∵ ^ ^ ⊙ ⊙\n\nRow 2: ∵ * ⊙ ∵ * ⊙ ⊙ \n\nRow 3: ∵ ∵ ⊙ ⊙ ⊙ * ^ \n\nRow 4: ⊙ ⇔ ^ ∵ ∵ ∵ ⇔ \n\nRow 5: ⊙ * ^ ⊙ * ⊙ ^ \n\nRow 6: ⊙ ^ ∵ ⇔ ⇔ ^ ⊙ \n\nSo columns are:\n\nColumn 1: Row1: ⊙, Row2: ∵, Row3: ∵, Row4: ⊙, Row5: ⊙, Row6: ⊙ → symbols: A, C, C, A, A, A\n\nColumn 2: Row1: *, Row2: *, Row3: ∵, Row4: ⇔, Row5: *, Row6: ^ → symbols: B, B, C, E, B, D\n\nColumn 3: Row1: ∵, Row2: ⊙, Row3: ⊙, Row4: ^, Row5: ⊙, Row6: ∵ → symbols: C, A, A, D, A, C\n\nColumn 4: Row1: ^, Row2: ∵, Row3: ⊙, Row4: ∵, Row5: ^, Row6: ⇔ → symbols: D, C, A, C, D, E\n\nColumn 5: Row1: ^, Row2: *, Row3: ⊙, Row4: ∵, Row5: *, Row6: ⇔ → symbols: D, B, A, C, B, E\n\nColumn 6: Row1: ⊙, Row2: ⊙, Row3: *, Row4: ∵, Row5: ⊙, Row6: ^ → symbols: A, A, B, C, A, D\n\nColumn 7: Row1: ⊙, Row2: ⊙, Row3: ^, Row4: ⇔, Row5: ^, Row6: ⊙ → symbols: A, A, D, E, D, A\n\nNow, compute each column's sum.\n\nLet's compute each column step by step.\n\nColumn 1: A, C, C, A, A, A → total symbols: 4A + 2C.\n\nSubstitute values:\n\nA = -95, C = -83.\n\nSo 4*(-95) + 2*(-83) = -380 -166 = -546.\n\nColumn 2: B, B, C, E, B, D → 3B + C + E + D.\n\nB=-77, C=-83, E=2, D=40.\n\nSo 3*(-77) + (-83) + 2 + 40 = -231 -83 + 42 = -231-83 is -314 +42 = -272.\n\nColumn 3: C, A, A, D, A, C → 3A + 2C + D.\n\nA=-95, C=-83, D=40.\n\n3*(-95) + 2*(-83) +40 = -285 -166 +40 = -411.\n\nColumn 4: D, C, A, C, D, E → 2D + 2C + A + E.\n\nD=40, C=-83, A=-95, E=2.\n\n2*40 + 2*(-83) + (-95) +2 = 80 -166 -95 +2 = (80 -166) = -86; -86 -95 = -181; -181 +2 = -179.\n\nColumn 5: D, B, A, C, B, E → D + 2B + A + C + E.\n\nD=40, B=-77, A=-95, C=-83, E=2.\n\n40 + 2*(-77) + (-95) + (-83) +2 = 40 -154 -95 -83 +2.\n\nCalculate step by step:\n\n40 -154 = -114; -114 -95 = -209; -209 -83 = -292; -292 +2 = -290.\n\nColumn 6: A, A, B, C, A, D → 3A + B + C + D.\n\nA=-95, B=-77, C=-83, D=40.\n\n3*(-95) + (-77) + (-83) +40 = -285 -77 -83 +40 = (-285-77= -362; -362-83=-445; -445+40=-405).\n\nColumn 7: A, A, D, E, D, A → 3A + 2D + E.\n\nA=-95, D=40, E=2.\n\n3*(-95) + 2*40 +2 = -285 +80 +2 = -203.\n\nSo the column sums are:\n\nColumn 1: -546\n\nColumn 2: -272\n\nColumn 3: -411\n\nColumn 4: -179\n\nColumn 5: -290\n\nColumn 6: -405\n\nColumn 7: -203\n\nSo the final answer is the list of these sums in order: [-546, -272, -411, -179, -290, -405, -203]\n\nLet me verify these calculations once again to be sure.\n\nCheck Column 1:\n\n4A + 2C = 4*(-95) + 2*(-83) = -380 -166 = -546.

      "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked. The task is to compute the sum of each column in a grid of symbols, given the row sums. Each symbol represents a numerical value. The grid has several rows, each with symbols and a sum at the end. The challenge is to figure out the column sums based on the given row sums and the symbols.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grid provided. Each row has symbols followed by a number which is the sum of that row. For example, the first row is \"∃⊕⇔%%∃⇔⇔∃\" with a sum of -114. The second row is \"∃%%%⇔∃↓↓%\" with a sum of 325, and so on. There are six rows in total. The symbols used are ∃, ⊕, ⇔, %, ↓. Each symbol has a specific value, but they are the same throughout the grid. My job is to determine the column sums once I figure out the values of each symbol.\n\nBut wait, how do I find the value of each symbol? Since there are multiple symbols, I need to set up equations based on the rows provided. Each row's sum is the sum of the values of its symbols. Let me count how many of each symbol are present in each row. Let's go through each row one by one.\n\nLet me list out each row's symbols and count them:\n\nRow 1: ∃⊕⇔%%∃⇔⇔∃\nSymbols: Let's count each symbol here. Let me write down the symbols in order:\n∃, ⊕, ⇔, %, %, ∃, ⇔, ⇔, ∃. So that's 3 ∃, 1 ⊕, 3 ⇔, 2 %, and the rest? No, that's all. So row 1 has 3∃, 1⊕, 3⇔, 2%.\n\nRow 2: ∃%%%⇔∃↓↓%\nSymbols: ∃, %, %, %, ⇔, ∃, ↓, ↓, %.\nCount: 2∃, 1⇔, 4%, 2↓.\n\nRow 3: ⇔↓⊕↓⊕∃⇔∃∃\nSymbols: ⇔, ↓, ⊕, ↓, ⊕, ∃, ⇔, ∃, ∃.\nCount: 3∃, 2⊕, 2⇔, 2↓.\n\nRow 4: ∃⇔∃%⊕↓↓%∃\nSymbols: ∃, ⇔, ∃, %, ⊕, ↓, ↓, %, ∃.\nCount: 3∃, 1⊕, 1⇔, 2%, 2↓.\n\nRow 5: %⊕∃⊕∃⇔∃⇔⊕\nSymbols: %, ⊕, ∃, ⊕, ∃, ⇔, ∃, ⇔, ⊕.\nCount: 3∃, 3⊕, 2⇔, 1%.\n\nRow 6: ⇔⇔∃⇔%⊕↓⊕⇔\nSymbols: ⇔, ⇔, ∃, ⇔, %, ⊕, ↓, ⊕, ⇔.\nCount: 1∃, 2⊕, 4⇔, 1%, 1↓.\n\nNow, each row's sum is given. Let me denote the value of each symbol as variables. Let me assign:\n\nLet E = value of ∃\nO = value of ⊕\nR = value of ⇔\nP = value of %\nD = value of ↓\n\nNow, for each row, I can write an equation based on the counts and the given sum.\n\nRow 1: 3E + 1O + 3R + 2P = -114\n\nRow 2: 2E + 1R + 4P + 2D = 325\n\nRow 3: 3E + 2O + 2R + 2D = -77\n\nRow 4: 3E + 1O + 1R + 2P + 2D = 200\n\nRow 5: 3E + 3O + 2R + 1P = -233\n\nRow 6: 1E + 2O + 4R + 1P + 1D = -393\n\nSo now, we have a system of 6 equations with 5 variables (E, O, R, P, D). Let me write them again:\n\n1) 3E + O + 3R + 2P = -114\n\n2) 2E + R + 4P + 2D = 325\n\n3) 3E + 2O + 2R + 2D = -77\n\n4) 3E + O + R + 2P + 2D = 200\n\n5) 3E + 3O + 2R + P = -233\n\n6) E + 2O + 4R + P + D = -393\n\nHmm, solving this system might be a bit complex. Let's see if we can find a way to solve for the variables. Since there are 6 equations and 5 variables, there might be redundancy or inconsistency, but let's proceed.\n\nLet me try to express variables in terms of others. Let me start by looking for equations that can be combined.\n\nFirst, perhaps equations 1, 3, 4, 5 involve E, O, R, P. Equations 2 and 6 involve D as well. Let me see.\n\nLet me first try to eliminate variables step by step.\n\nLet me consider equations 1, 3, 4, 5 for the variables E, O, R, P.\n\nEquation 1: 3E + O + 3R + 2P = -114\n\nEquation 3: 3E + 2O + 2R + 2D = -77. Wait, equation 3 also has D. Maybe I need to first find equations that don't involve D. Let me check:\n\nEquations without D: 1, 5.\n\nEquations with D: 2, 3, 4, 6.\n\nSo perhaps first solve equations 1 and 5 for E, O, R, P, then use others.\n\nEquation 1: 3E + O + 3R + 2P = -114\n\nEquation 5: 3E + 3O + 2R + P = -233\n\nLet me subtract equation 1 from equation 5 to eliminate E.\n\nEquation 5 minus equation 1:\n\n(3E - 3E) + (3O - O) + (2R - 3R) + (P - 2P) = -233 - (-114)\n\nWhich is:\n\n0E + 2O - R - P = -119\n\nSo equation A: 2O - R - P = -119.\n\nLet me note that as equation A.\n\nNow, perhaps find another equation involving these variables. Let's look at equation 4, which includes D, but maybe we can combine with equation 2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe find another equation. Let's see.\n\nLooking at equation 4: 3E + O + R + 2P + 2D = 200.\n\nBut equation 4 has D. Maybe not helpful yet. Let's see if we can find another equation in terms of E, O, R, P. Let me check equation 5 again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps find another equation. Let me think. Let me take equation 1 and equation 5. Maybe we can find another relation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps take equation 5 and equation 1 again. Let me think of equation A: 2O - R - P = -119. Let me try to find another equation involving O, R, P.\n\nLet me check equation 1: 3E + O + 3R + 2P = -114.\n\nEquation 5: 3E + 3O + 2R + P = -233.\n\nLet me also consider equation 4, but it has D. Maybe not. Let me think if there's another equation. Let's check equation 3: 3E + 2O + 2R + 2D = -77. Hmm, but again D is there. Maybe we can find another equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps take equation 5 and equation 1 again. Let me try to express E from equation 1.\n\nFrom equation 1: 3E = -114 - O - 3R - 2P → E = [ -114 - O - 3R - 2P ] / 3.\n\nBut substituting into equation 5 would give:\n\n3 * [ (-114 - O - 3R - 2P)/3 ] + 3O + 2R + P = -233\n\nSimplify:\n\n(-114 - O - 3R - 2P) + 3O + 2R + P = -233\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-114 - O + 3O -3R + 2R -2P + P = -233\n\nWhich is:\n\n-114 + 2O - R - P = -233\n\nWhich is the same as equation A: 2O - R - P = -119. So no new information here.\n\nHmm. Let me think. Maybe we need another equation. Let's see. Let me check equation 5 and equation 1 again. Maybe combine with another equation. Let me look for equations that involve E, O, R, P.\n\nAlternatively, maybe equation 5 and equation 1 can be used to express variables in terms of others. For example, from equation A: 2O - R - P = -119 → R + P = 2O + 119.\n\nLet me note that as equation A'.\n\nNow, let me see if there are other equations involving E, O, R, P. Let me check equation 5 again. Maybe equation 1 and equation 5 can be combined with another equation. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps take equation 5 and equation 1 to express variables. Let me also check equation 4. Equation 4 is 3E + O + R + 2P + 2D = 200. But D is present here. Maybe we can find another equation involving D. Let's look at equation 2: 2E + R + 4P + 2D = 325. Let me see if I can express D from equation 2.\n\nEquation 2: 2D = 325 - 2E - R - 4P → D = (325 - 2E - R - 4P)/2.\n\nThen, substitute D into equation 4. Let's do that.\n\nEquation 4: 3E + O + R + 2P + 2D = 200.\n\nSubstituting D:\n\n3E + O + R + 2P + 2*( (325 - 2E - R - 4P)/2 ) = 200.\n\nSimplify:\n\n3E + O + R + 2P + (325 - 2E - R -4P) = 200.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(3E - 2E) + O + (R - R) + (2P -4P) + 325 = 200.\n\nWhich is:\n\nE + O - 2P + 325 = 200 → E + O - 2P = 200 - 325 → E + O - 2P = -125.\n\nLet me note this as equation B: E + O - 2P = -125.\n\nNow, equation B is another equation involving E, O, P. Let me see if I can use equation 1 and equation B to find relations.\n\nEquation 1: 3E + O + 3R + 2P = -114.\n\nEquation B: E + O - 2P = -125.\n\nLet me subtract equation B from equation 1 multiplied by something. Let me try to eliminate O. Let me multiply equation B by 1 and subtract from equation 1 multiplied by 1? Wait:\n\nLet me write equation 1 and equation B:\n\nEquation 1: 3E + O + 3R + 2P = -114\n\nEquation B: E + O - 2P = -125\n\nIf I subtract equation B from equation 1, I get:\n\n(3E - E) + (O - O) + 3R + (2P - (-2P))? Wait no. Wait equation B is E + O - 2P = -125. So subtracting equation B from equation 1:\n\n(3E - E) + (O - O) + 3R + (2P - (- (-2P)))? Wait, perhaps better to write:\n\nEquation 1 - equation B:\n\n(3E - E) + (O - O) + 3R + [2P - (- (-2P))] ?\n\nWait, let me re-calculate:\n\nEquation 1 minus equation B:\n\n(3E - E) + (O - O) + 3R + [2P - (- (-2P))] ?\n\nNo, perhaps better to compute:\n\nEquation 1: 3E + O + 3R + 2P = -114\n\nMinus equation B: -(E + O - 2P) = -(-125) → -E - O + 2P = 125.\n\nAdding these together:\n\n3E + O + 3R + 2P - E - O + 2P = -114 + 125.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(3E - E) + (O - O) + 3R + (2P + 2P) = 11.\n\nWhich is:\n\n2E + 3R + 4P = 11. Let's call this equation C.\n\nNow, equation C: 2E + 3R + 4P = 11.\n\nNow, we have equation A' (R + P = 2O + 119) and equation B (E + O - 2P = -125), equation C (2E + 3R + 4P = 11). Let me see if I can combine these.\n\nBut maybe I need more equations. Let's see. Let's check equation 5 again. Equation 5: 3E + 3O + 2R + P = -233. Let me see if I can use equation A' here.\n\nFrom equation A': R + P = 2O + 119 → R = 2O + 119 - P.\n\nLet me substitute R into equation 5.\n\nEquation 5: 3E + 3O + 2R + P = -233.\n\nSubstituting R:\n\n3E + 3O + 2*(2O + 119 - P) + P = -233.\n\nExpanding:\n\n3E + 3O + 4O + 238 - 2P + P = -233.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3E + 7O + 238 - P = -233.\n\nRearranged:\n\n3E + 7O - P = -233 - 238 = -471.\n\nSo equation D: 3E + 7O - P = -471.\n\nNow, let me also look at equation B: E + O - 2P = -125. Let me solve equation B for E:\n\nE = -125 - O + 2P.\n\nLet me substitute this E into equation D.\n\nEquation D: 3*(-125 - O + 2P) + 7O - P = -471.\n\nCalculating:\n\n-375 -3O + 6P +7O -P = -471.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-375) + ( -3O +7O ) + (6P - P ) = -471.\n\nWhich is:\n\n-375 +4O +5P = -471.\n\nRearranged:\n\n4O +5P = -471 + 375 = -96.\n\nEquation E: 4O +5P = -96.\n\nNow, let's also use equation A' again: R + P = 2O + 119. So R = 2O +119 - P.\n\nAlso, equation C is 2E +3R +4P =11. Let me substitute E from equation B into equation C.\n\nE from equation B is E = -125 - O + 2P.\n\nSo equation C: 2*(-125 - O + 2P) +3R +4P = 11.\n\nExpanding:\n\n-250 -2O +4P +3R +4P = 11.\n\nCombine:\n\n-250 -2O +8P +3R = 11.\n\nNow, substitute R from equation A' (R=2O +119 - P):\n\n-250 -2O +8P +3*(2O +119 - P) = 11.\n\nExpanding the 3*(...):\n\n-250 -2O +8P +6O +357 -3P = 11.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-250 + 357) + (-2O +6O) + (8P -3P) = 11.\n\nWhich is:\n\n107 +4O +5P = 11.\n\nSo 4O +5P = 11 -107 = -96.\n\nWhich gives equation F: 4O +5P = -96. Wait, this is the same as equation E. So no new information here. So equation E and F are the same. So that means we need another equation to solve for O and P.\n\nWe have equation E: 4O +5P = -96. But we need another equation involving O and P. Let me check if there's another equation I can derive.\n\nLet me think. Let me check equation 5 again? Or maybe look at equation 3. Equation 3 is 3E +2O +2R +2D = -77. But equation 3 includes D. Maybe I can find another equation involving O and P by combining with equations involving D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use equation 6. Equation 6 is E +2O +4R +P +D = -393.\n\nLet me see. If I can express D from equation 2, which is D = (325 -2E -R -4P)/2.\n\nLet me substitute that into equation 6.\n\nEquation 6: E +2O +4R +P + D = -393.\n\nSubstitute D:\n\nE +2O +4R +P + [ (325 -2E -R -4P)/2 ] = -393.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate denominator:\n\n2E +4O +8R +2P +325 -2E -R -4P = -786.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(2E -2E) +4O + (8R - R) + (2P -4P) +325 = -786.\n\nWhich is:\n\n0E +4O +7R -2P +325 = -786.\n\nRearranged:\n\n4O +7R -2P = -786 -325 = -1111.\n\nEquation G: 4O +7R -2P = -1111.\n\nNow, from equation A', R = 2O +119 - P. Let me substitute this R into equation G.\n\nEquation G becomes:\n\n4O +7*(2O +119 - P) -2P = -1111.\n\nExpanding:\n\n4O +14O + 833 -7P -2P = -1111.\n\nCombine:\n\n18O +833 -9P = -1111.\n\nRearranged:\n\n18O -9P = -1111 -833 = -1944.\n\nDivide both sides by 9:\n\n2O - P = -216.\n\nEquation H: 2O - P = -216.\n\nNow, we have equation E: 4O +5P = -96 and equation H: 2O - P = -216.\n\nLet me solve these two equations. Let me express equation H as P = 2O + 216. Wait:\n\nEquation H: 2O - P = -216 → P = 2O + 216.\n\nSubstitute this into equation E:\n\n4O +5*(2O +216) = -96.\n\nCalculate:\n\n4O +10O +1080 = -96 → 14O +1080 = -96 → 14O = -96 -1080 = -1176 → O = -1176 /14 = -84.\n\nSo O = -84.\n\nNow, substitute O = -84 into equation H: P = 2*(-84) +216 = -168 +216 = 48. So P = 48.\n\nNow, with O and P known, we can find other variables.\n\nFrom equation E: 4O +5P = 4*(-84) +5*48 = -336 +240 = -96. Which checks out.\n\nNow, from equation A': R + P = 2O +119 → R +48 = 2*(-84) +119 → R +48 = -168 +119 = -49 → R = -49 -48 = -97. So R = -97.\n\nNow, from equation B: E + O -2P = -125 → E + (-84) -2*(48) = -125 → E -84 -96 = -125 → E - 180 = -125 → E = -125 + 180 = 55. So E = 55.\n\nNow, we have E=55, O=-84, R=-97, P=48. Now, we need to find D. Let me use equation 2: 2E + R +4P +2D = 325.\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n2*55 + (-97) +4*48 +2D = 325 → 110 -97 + 192 +2D = 325 → (110-97)=13, 13+192=205. So 205 +2D = 325 → 2D=120 → D=60.\n\nLet me verify with another equation. Let me check equation 3: 3E +2O +2R +2D = -77.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n3*55 + 2*(-84) + 2*(-97) + 2*60 = 165 -168 -194 +120 = Let's calculate step by step:\n\n165 -168 = -3; -3 -194 = -197; -197 +120 = -77. Correct. So equation 3 is satisfied.\n\nCheck equation 4: 3E + O + R +2P +2D = 200.\n\n3*55 + (-84) + (-97) + 2*48 + 2*60 = 165 -84 -97 +96 +120.\n\nCalculating:\n\n165-84=81; 81-97=-16; -16+96=80; 80+120=200. Correct.\n\nCheck equation 5: 3E +3O +2R +P = -233.\n\n3*55 +3*(-84) +2*(-97) +48 = 165 -252 -194 +48 = 165-252= -87; -87-194=-281; -281+48=-233. Correct.\n\nCheck equation 6: E +2O +4R +P +D = -393.\n\n55 +2*(-84) +4*(-97) +48 +60 = 55 -168 -388 +48 +60.\n\nCalculating:\n\n55-168= -113; -113-388= -501; -501+48= -453; -453+60= -393. Correct.\n\nGreat! All equations are satisfied. So the values are:\n\nE (∃) = 55\n\nO (⊕) = -84\n\nR (⇔) = -97\n\nP (%) = 48\n\nD (↓) = 60\n\nNow, with these values, we need to compute the column sums. The grid has several rows, each with symbols. The columns are determined by the positions in the rows. Since each row has the same number of symbols? Let me check the length of each row.\n\nLooking back at the grid:\n\nRow 1: \"∃⊕⇔%%∃⇔⇔∃\" has 9 symbols (since the sum is after, but let me count the symbols: ∃, ⊕, ⇔, %, %, ∃, ⇔, ⇔, ∃ → 9 symbols).\n\nRow 2: \"∃%%%⇔∃↓↓%\" → ∃, %, %, %, ⇔, ∃, ↓, ↓, % → 9 symbols.\n\nRow 3: \"⇔↓⊕↓⊕∃⇔∃∃\" → ⇔, ↓, ⊕, ↓, ⊕, ∃, ⇔, ∃, ∃ → 9 symbols.\n\nRow 4: \"∃⇔∃%⊕↓↓%∃\" → ∃, ⇔, ∃, %, ⊕, ↓, ↓, %, ∃ → 9 symbols.\n\nRow 5: \"%⊕∃⊕∃⇔∃⇔⊕\" → %, ⊕, ∃, ⊕, ∃, ⇔, ∃, ⇔, ⊕ → 9 symbols.\n\nRow 6: \"⇔⇔∃⇔%⊕↓⊕⇔\" → ⇔, ⇔, ∃, ⇔, %, ⊕, ↓, ⊕, ⇔ → 9 symbols.\n\nSo each row has 9 symbols. Therefore, there are 9 columns. The task is to compute the sum of each column (from column 1 to column 9) by adding the values of the symbols in each column across the 6 rows.\n\nNow, let me list each row's symbols column by column. Let me create a table where each row's symbols are in columns 1 to 9.\n\nLet me write each row's symbols in order:\n\nRow 1: [∃, ⊕, ⇔, %, %, ∃, ⇔, ⇔, ∃]\n\nRow 2: [∃, %, %, %, ⇔, ∃, ↓, ↓, %]\n\nRow 3: [⇔, ↓, ⊕, ↓, ⊕, ∃, ⇔, ∃, ∃]\n\nRow 4: [∃, ⇔, ∃, %, ⊕, ↓, ↓, %, ∃]\n\nRow 5: [%, ⊕, ∃, ⊕, ∃, ⇔, ∃, ⇔, ⊕]\n\nRow 6: [⇔, ⇔, ∃, ⇔, %, ⊕, ↓, ⊕, ⇔]\n\nNow, for each column (1 to 9), I need to find which symbols are present in each row, then sum their values.\n\nLet me go column by column.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow1: ∃ (55)\n\nRow2: ∃ (55)\n\nRow3: ⇔ (-97)\n\nRow4: ∃ (55)\n\nRow5: % (48)\n\nRow6: ⇔ (-97)\n\nSum: 55 +55 + (-97) +55 +48 + (-97) = Let's compute step by step:\n\n55 +55 = 110; + (-97) = 13; +55 = 68; +48 = 116; + (-97) = 19.\n\nSo column 1 sum: 19.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow1: ⊕ (-84)\n\nRow2: % (48)\n\nRow3: ↓ (60)\n\nRow4: ⇔ (-97)\n\nRow5: ⊕ (-84)\n\nRow6: ⇔ (-97)\n\nSum: -84 +48 +60 + (-97) + (-84) + (-97).\n\nCalculating:\n\nStart with -84 +48 = -36; +60 = 24; -97 → -73; -84 → -157; -97 → -254.\n\nColumn 2 sum: -254.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow1: ⇔ (-97)\n\nRow2: % (48)\n\nRow3: ⊕ (-84)\n\nRow4: ∃ (55)\n\nRow5: ∃ (55)\n\nRow6: ∃ (55)\n\nSum: -97 +48 + (-84) +55 +55 +55.\n\nCompute:\n\n-97 +48 = -49; -49 -84 = -133; +55 = -78; +55 = -23; +55 = 32.\n\nColumn 3 sum: 32.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nRow1: % (48)\n\nRow2: % (48)\n\nRow3: ↓ (60)\n\nRow4: % (48)\n\nRow5: ⊕ (-84)\n\nRow6: ⇔ (-97)\n\nSum: 48 +48 +60 +48 + (-84) + (-97).\n\nCalculating:\n\n48+48=96; +60=156; +48=204; -84=120; -97=23.\n\nColumn 4 sum: 23.\n\nColumn 5:\n\nRow1: % (48)\n\nRow2: ⇔ (-97)\n\nRow3: ⊕ (-84)\n\nRow4: ⊕ (-84)\n\nRow5: ∃ (55)\n\nRow6: % (48)\n\nSum: 48 + (-97) + (-84) + (-84) +55 +48.\n\nCompute:\n\n48 -97 = -49; -49 -84 = -133; -133 -84 = -217; +55 = -162; +48 = -114.\n\nColumn 5 sum: -114.\n\nColumn 6:\n\nRow1: ∃ (55)\n\nRow2: ∃ (55)\n\nRow3: ∃ (55)\n\nRow4: ↓ (60)\n\nRow5: ⇔ (-97)\n\nRow6: ⊕ (-84)\n\nSum: 55 +55 +55 +60 + (-97) + (-84).\n\nCalculating:\n\n55+55=110; +55=165; +60=225; -97=128; -84=44.\n\nColumn 6 sum: 44.\n\nColumn 7:\n\nRow1: ⇔ (-97)\n\nRow2: ↓ (60)\n\nRow3: ⇔ (-97)\n\nRow4: ↓ (60)\n\nRow5: ∃ (55)\n\nRow6: ↓ (60)\n\nSum: -97 +60 + (-97) +60 +55 +60.\n\nCompute:\n\n-97 +60 = -37; -37 -97 = -134; +60 = -74; +55 = -19; +60 = 41.\n\nColumn 7 sum: 41.\n\nColumn 8:\n\nRow1: ⇔ (-97)\n\nRow2: ↓ (60)\n\nRow3: ∃ (55)\n\nRow4: % (48)\n\nRow5: ⇔ (-97)\n\nRow6: ⊕ (-84)\n\nSum: -97 +60 +55 +48 + (-97) + (-84).\n\nCalculating:\n\n-97 +60 = -37; +55 = 18; +48 = 66; -97 = -31; -84 = -115.\n\nColumn 8 sum: -115.\n\nColumn 9:\n\nRow1: ∃ (55)\n\nRow2: % (48)\n\nRow3: ∃ (55)\n\nRow4: ∃ (55)\n\nRow5: ⊕ (-84)\n\nRow6: ⇔ (-97)\n\nSum: 55 +48 +55 +55 + (-84) + (-97).\n\nCalculating:\n\n55+48=103; +55=158; +55=213; -84=129; -97=32.\n\nColumn 9 sum: 32.\n\nSo compiling all the column sums:\n\nColumn 1: 19\n\nColumn 2: -254\n\nColumn 3: 32\n\nColumn 4: 23\n\nColumn 5: -114\n\nColumn 6: 44\n\nColumn 7: 41\n\nColumn 8: -115\n\nColumn 9: 32\n\nTherefore, the answer should be the list [19, -254, 32, 23, -114, 44, 41, -115, 32].\n\nLet me verify if these column sums make sense.

      "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to compute the sum of each column in the given grid based on the row sums provided. Each symbol in the grid represents a numerical value, but I don't know what those values are yet. The challenge is to figure out the column sums using the row sums given.\n\nFirst, let me write down the grid and the row sums to visualize it better. Here's the grid as given:\n\nRow 1: ⇔ ∈ * ∞ ∈    Sum: -82  \nRow 2: ⇔ ∞ ∈ * ⇔    Sum: -16  \nRow 3: ∞ * * ∞ ∞    Sum: 17  \nRow 4: * ⇔ ∞ ∞ ⇔    Sum: 57  \nRow 5: * ⇔ * * ∈    Sum: -117  \nRow 6: ∈ ⇔ ⇔ ⇔ ∞    Sum: 31  \nRow 7: ∞ ⇔ ∞ * *    Sum: 10  \nRow 8: * ∈ ∞ ⇔ ⇔    Sum: -16  \nRow 9: * ⇔ ∈ ∈ *    Sum: -136  \n\nWait, but looking at the original input, each row has symbols followed by their row sum. Let me check again. For example, the first line is \"⇔∈*∞∈ -82\", which I assume is the symbols for row 1 and the sum. Each row seems to have 5 symbols, except maybe some? Let me count the symbols in each row:\n\nRow 1: 5 symbols (⇔, ∈, *, ∞, ∈)  \nRow 2: 5 symbols (⇔, ∞, ∈, *, ⇔)  \nRow 3: 5 symbols (∞, *, *, ∞, ∞)  \nRow 4: 5 symbols (*, ⇔, ∞, ∞, ⇔)  \nRow 5: 5 symbols (*, ⇔, *, *, ∈)  \nRow 6: 5 symbols (∈, ⇔, ⇔, ⇔, ∞)  \nRow 7: 5 symbols (∞, ⇔, ∞, *, *)  \nWait, the original input for row 7 is \"∞⇔∞** 10\"—so symbols are ∞, ⇔, ∞, *, * (5 symbols). Yes. Similarly, row 8 is \"*∈∞⇔⇔ -16\"—symbols *, ∈, ∞, ⇔, ⇔. And row 9 is \"*⇔∈∈* -136\"—symbols *, ⇔, ∈, ∈, *. All rows have 5 symbols. So the grid is 9 rows by 5 columns. So the columns are 5 in total, and I need to find the sum for each of these 5 columns.\n\nThe approach here is to set up equations based on the symbols and their row sums. Since each symbol represents a numerical value, we can assign variables to each unique symbol and then create equations for each row. Then, solve the system of equations to find the value of each symbol. Once we have the symbol values, we can compute the column sums by adding up the symbols in each column multiplied by their values.\n\nBut there are multiple symbols here. Let's list all the unique symbols present. From the grid:\n\nSymbols are: ⇔, ∈, *, ∞. Wait, let me check again. Let's go through each row:\n\nRow 1: ⇔, ∈, *, ∞, ∈  \nRow 2: ⇔, ∞, ∈, *, ⇔  \nRow 3: ∞, *, *, ∞, ∞  \nRow 4: *, ⇔, ∞, ∞, ⇔  \nRow 5: *, ⇔, *, *, ∈  \nRow 6: ∈, ⇔, ⇔, ⇔, ∞  \nRow 7: ∞, ⇔, ∞, *, *  \nRow 8: *, ∈, ∞, ⇔, ⇔  \nRow 9: *, ⇔, ∈, ∈, *  \n\nSo the symbols are: ⇔, ∈, *, ∞. So four unique symbols. Let's assign variables to each:\n\nLet’s denote:\nA = ⇔  \nB = ∈  \nC = *  \nD = ∞  \n\nNow, each row's sum can be written as an equation in terms of A, B, C, D.\n\nLet me write down each row's equation:\n\nRow 1: A + B + C + D + B = -82 → A + 2B + C + D = -82  \nRow 2: A + D + B + C + A = -16 → 2A + B + C + D = -16  \nRow 3: D + C + C + D + D = 17 → 3D + 2C = 17  \nRow 4: C + A + D + D + A = 57 → 2A + C + 2D = 57  \nRow 5: C + A + C + C + B = -117 → A + 3C + B = -117  \nRow 6: B + A + A + A + D = 31 → 3A + B + D = 31  \nRow 7: D + A + D + C + C = 10 → 2D + 2C + A = 10  \nRow 8: C + B + D + A + A = -16 → 2A + C + B + D = -16  \nRow 9: C + A + B + B + C = -136 → 2C + A + 2B = -136  \n\nSo now we have 9 equations with 4 variables. However, since there are more equations than variables, we can check for consistency and solve the system.\n\nLet me list all equations again:\n\n1. A + 2B + C + D = -82  \n2. 2A + B + C + D = -16  \n3. 3D + 2C = 17  \n4. 2A + C + 2D = 57  \n5. A + 3C + B = -117  \n6. 3A + B + D = 31  \n7. A + 2D + 2C = 10  \n8. 2A + C + B + D = -16  \n9. A + 2B + 2C = -136  \n\nHmm. Let me note that equations 2 and 8 look similar. Let's check equation 2 and 8:\n\nEquation 2: 2A + B + C + D = -16  \nEquation 8: 2A + C + B + D = -16 → same as equation 2. So equations 2 and 8 are the same. So that's redundant.\n\nSimilarly, equations 1 and 8? Let me check again. No, equation 1 is A + 2B + C + D = -82. Equation 8 is 2A + B + C + D = -16. Wait, no, equation 8 is 2A + C + B + D = -16, which is same as equation 2. So equation 8 is same as equation 2. So we can ignore equation 8 as redundant.\n\nSimilarly, maybe other equations are redundant, but let's proceed.\n\nSo, our system is:\n\nEquation 1: A + 2B + C + D = -82  \nEquation 2: 2A + B + C + D = -16  \nEquation 3: 3D + 2C = 17  \nEquation 4: 2A + C + 2D = 57  \nEquation 5: A + B + 3C = -117  \nEquation 6: 3A + B + D = 31  \nEquation 7: A + 2C + 2D = 10  \nEquation 9: A + 2B + 2C = -136  \n\nSo, four variables (A, B, C, D) and eight equations. Let's try to solve this system.\n\nFirst, let's look for equations that can be solved directly or simplified.\n\nEquation 3: 3D + 2C = 17 → Let's note this as equation (3). Maybe we can express one variable in terms of another.\n\nEquation 7: A + 2C + 2D = 10 → Let's note this as equation (7).\n\nEquation 4: 2A + C + 2D = 57 → equation (4).\n\nEquation 5: A + B + 3C = -117 → equation (5).\n\nEquation 6: 3A + B + D = 31 → equation (6).\n\nEquation 1: A + 2B + C + D = -82 → equation (1).\n\nEquation 2: 2A + B + C + D = -16 → equation (2).\n\nEquation 9: A + 2B + 2C = -136 → equation (9).\n\nLet me see if I can find relations between equations.\n\nFirst, equations 1 and 2 can be subtracted to eliminate some variables.\n\nEquation 2 minus Equation 1:\n\n(2A + B + C + D) - (A + 2B + C + D) = -16 - (-82)\n\nSimplify:\n\n(2A - A) + (B - 2B) + (C - C) + (D - D) = 66\n\nWhich is:\n\nA - B = 66 → A = B + 66 → equation (a)\n\nSo, A = B + 66.\n\nThis is a useful relation. Let's note that.\n\nNow, let's look at equation 5: A + B + 3C = -117. Since A = B + 66, substitute into equation 5:\n\n(B + 66) + B + 3C = -117 → 2B + 66 + 3C = -117 → 2B + 3C = -117 -66 = -183 → 2B + 3C = -183 → equation (b)\n\nSimilarly, equation 6: 3A + B + D = 31. Substitute A = B + 66:\n\n3(B + 66) + B + D = 31 → 3B + 198 + B + D = 31 → 4B + D = 31 - 198 → 4B + D = -167 → equation (c)\n\nEquation 1: A + 2B + C + D = -82. Substitute A = B + 66:\n\n(B + 66) + 2B + C + D = -82 → 3B + 66 + C + D = -82 → 3B + C + D = -148 → equation (d)\n\nEquation 2: 2A + B + C + D = -16. Substitute A = B + 66:\n\n2(B + 66) + B + C + D = -16 → 2B + 132 + B + C + D = -16 → 3B + C + D = -148 → same as equation (d). So that's consistent.\n\nNow, equation (d) is 3B + C + D = -148.\n\nLet me see if we can find another equation involving B, C, D.\n\nLooking at equation (c): 4B + D = -167 → D = -167 -4B → equation (e)\n\nSubstitute equation (e) into equation (d):\n\n3B + C + (-167 -4B) = -148 → 3B -4B + C -167 = -148 → -B + C = 19 → C = B + 19 → equation (f)\n\nSo, equation (f) gives C in terms of B: C = B + 19.\n\nNow, equation (b): 2B + 3C = -183. Substitute C = B + 19:\n\n2B + 3(B + 19) = -183 → 2B + 3B + 57 = -183 → 5B = -183 -57 = -240 → B = -240 / 5 = -48.\n\nSo, B = -48.\n\nNow, using equation (a): A = B + 66 → A = -48 + 66 = 18.\n\nUsing equation (f): C = B + 19 → C = -48 +19 = -29.\n\nUsing equation (e): D = -167 -4B → D = -167 -4*(-48) = -167 + 192 = 25.\n\nSo now, we have:\n\nA (⇔) = 18  \nB (∈) = -48  \nC (*) = -29  \nD (∞) = 25  \n\nNow let's verify these values against the equations to check for consistency.\n\nFirst, equation 3: 3D + 2C = 17 → 3*25 + 2*(-29) = 75 -58 = 17 → Correct.\n\nEquation 4: 2A + C + 2D = 57 → 2*18 + (-29) + 2*25 = 36 -29 +50 = 57 → 57. Correct.\n\nEquation 5: A + B + 3C = 18 + (-48) + 3*(-29) = 18 -48 -87 = -117. Correct.\n\nEquation 6: 3A + B + D = 3*18 + (-48) +25 = 54 -48 +25 = 31. Correct.\n\nEquation 7: A + 2C + 2D = 18 + 2*(-29) + 2*25 = 18 -58 +50 = 10. Correct.\n\nEquation 9: A + 2B + 2C = 18 + 2*(-48) + 2*(-29) = 18 -96 -58 = -136. Correct.\n\nEquation 1: A + 2B + C + D = 18 + 2*(-48) + (-29) +25 = 18 -96 -29 +25 = (18+25) - (96+29) = 43 -125 = -82. Correct.\n\nEquation 2: 2A + B + C + D = 2*18 + (-48) + (-29) +25 = 36 -48 -29 +25 = (36+25) - (48+29) = 61 -77 = -16. Correct.\n\nAll equations check out. Great! So the values are correct.\n\nNow, with the values of each symbol known, we can compute the column sums.\n\nThe grid has 5 columns. Let's go through each column, sum up the symbols in that column, then multiply by their respective values.\n\nLet me reconstruct the grid with the symbols and their positions:\n\nRow 1: ⇔ (A), ∈ (B), * (C), ∞ (D), ∈ (B)  \nRow 2: ⇔ (A), ∞ (D), ∈ (B), * (C), ⇔ (A)  \nRow 3: ∞ (D), * (C), * (C), ∞ (D), ∞ (D)  \nRow 4: * (C), ⇔ (A), ∞ (D), ∞ (D), ⇔ (A)  \nRow 5: * (C), ⇔ (A), * (C), * (C), ∈ (B)  \nRow 6: ∈ (B), ⇔ (A), ⇔ (A), ⇔ (A), ∞ (D)  \nRow 7: ∞ (D), ⇔ (A), ∞ (D), * (C), * (C)  \nRow 8: * (C), ∈ (B), ∞ (D), ⇔ (A), ⇔ (A)  \nRow 9: * (C), ⇔ (A), ∈ (B), ∈ (B), * (C)  \n\nNow, for each column (columns 1 to 5), let's list the symbols and compute their sum.\n\nColumn 1:  \nRow 1: A  \nRow 2: A  \nRow 3: D  \nRow 4: C  \nRow 5: C  \nRow 6: B  \nRow 7: D  \nRow 8: C  \nRow 9: C  \n\nSo symbols in column 1: A, A, D, C, C, B, D, C, C  \nSum for column 1: 2A + 2D + 4C + B  \nLet me compute that:\n\nA = 18, B = -48, C = -29, D =25  \nSo:\n\n2*18 + 2*25 + 4*(-29) + (-48)  \n= 36 + 50 - 116 -48  \n= (36+50) = 86; 86 -116 = -30; -30 -48 = -78.\n\nColumn 1 sum: -78.\n\nColumn 2:  \nRow 1: B  \nRow 2: D  \nRow 3: C  \nRow 4: A  \nRow 5: A  \nRow 6: A  \nRow 7: A  \nRow 8: B  \nRow 9: A  \n\nSymbols: B, D, C, A, A, A, A, B, A  \nSum: Let's count:\n\nB: 2 times  \nD: 1  \nC: 1  \nA: 5 times  \nSo sum: 2B + D + C + 5A  \nCalculating:\n\n2*(-48) +25 + (-29) +5*18  \n= -96 +25 -29 +90  \n= (-96 -29) + (25 +90)  \n= -125 + 115 = -10.\n\nColumn 2 sum: -10.\n\nColumn 3:  \nRow 1: C  \nRow 2: B  \nRow 3: C  \nRow 4: D  \nRow 5: C  \nRow 6: A  \nRow 7: D  \nRow 8: ∞ (D? Wait, row 8's third symbol is ∞ (D). Wait let me check:\n\nRow 8: * (C), ∈ (B), ∞ (D), ⇔ (A), ⇔ (A). So column 3 is D. So column 3 symbols:\n\nRow 1: C  \nRow 2: B  \nRow 3: C  \nRow 4: D  \nRow 5: C  \nRow 6: A  \nRow 7: D  \nRow 8: D  \nRow 9: B  \n\nSo symbols: C, B, C, D, C, A, D, D, B  \nCount:\n\nC: 3 times  \nB: 2 times  \nD: 3 times  \nA: 1 time  \nSum: 3C + 2B + 3D + A  \nCalculating:\n\n3*(-29) + 2*(-48) + 3*25 +18  \n= -87 -96 +75 +18  \n= (-87 -96) + (75 +18)  \n= -183 +93 = -90.\n\nColumn 3 sum: -90.\n\nColumn 4:  \nRow 1: D  \nRow 2: C  \nRow 3: D  \nRow 4: D  \nRow 5: C  \nRow 6: A  \nRow 7: C  \nRow 8: A  \nRow 9: B  \n\nSymbols: D, C, D, D, C, A, C, A, B  \nCount:\n\nD: 3 times  \nC: 3 times  \nA: 2 times  \nB: 1 time  \nSum: 3D +3C +2A +B  \nCalculating:\n\n3*25 +3*(-29) +2*18 + (-48)  \n=75 -87 +36 -48  \n= (75 +36) - (87 +48)  \n= 111 - 135 = -24.\n\nColumn 4 sum: -24.\n\nColumn 5:  \nRow 1: B  \nRow 2: A  \nRow 3: D  \nRow 4: A  \nRow 5: B  \nRow 6: D  \nRow 7: C  \nRow 8: A  \nRow 9: C  \n\nSymbols: B, A, D, A, B, D, C, A, C  \nCount:\n\nB: 2 times  \nA: 3 times  \nD: 2 times  \nC: 2 times  \nSum: 2B +3A +2D +2C  \nCalculating:\n\n2*(-48) +3*18 +2*25 +2*(-29)  \n= -96 +54 +50 -58  \n= (-96 -58) + (54 +50)  \n= -154 + 104 = -50.\n\nColumn 5 sum: -50.\n\nSo the column sums are:\n\nColumn 1: -78  \nColumn 2: -10  \nColumn 3: -90  \nColumn 4: -24  \nColumn 5: -50  \n\nLet me verify if these column sums add up to the total sum of all rows. The total sum of all rows is the sum of all row sums. Let's compute that.\n\nRow sums: -82, -16, 17, 57, -117, 31, 10, -16, -136.\n\nAdding them up:\n\nStart adding step by step:\n\nStart with 0.\n\nAdd -82: -82  \nAdd -16: -98  \nAdd 17: -81  \nAdd 57: -24  \nAdd -117: -141  \nAdd 31: -110  \nAdd 10: -100  \nAdd -16: -116  \nAdd -136: -252.\n\nTotal sum of all rows: -252.\n\nNow, sum of column sums: -78 + (-10) + (-90) + (-24) + (-50) = let's calculate:\n\n-78 -10 is -88; -88 -90 is -178; -178 -24 is -202; -202 -50 is -252. Correct. So the total matches. That's a good consistency check.\n\nTherefore, the column sums are as calculated.\n\nThe answer should be a list of the column sums in order from column 1 to column 5: [-78, -10, -90, -24, -50].\n\nBut wait, let me check the columns again to make sure I didn't mix up any columns.\n\nFor example, column 1: first element of each row. Yes, as per the grid. Let me recheck column 3 sum.\n\nColumn 3 symbols:\n\nRow 1: *, which is C (-29)  \nRow 2: ∈, which is B (-48)  \nRow 3: *, which is C (-29)  \nRow 4: ∞, which is D (25)  \nRow 5: *, which is C (-29)  \nRow 6: ⇔, which is A (18)  \nRow 7: ∞, D (25)  \nRow 8: ∞, D (25)  \nRow 9: ∈, B (-48)\n\nWait, no, column 3 is the third symbol in each row. Let me recheck:\n\nRow 1: symbols are ⇔, ∈, *, ∞, ∈ → third is * (C)  \nRow 2: ⇔, ∞, ∈, *, ⇔ → third is ∈ (B)  \nRow 3: ∞, *, *, ∞, ∞ → third is * (C)  \nRow 4: *, ⇔, ∞, ∞, ⇔ → third is ∞ (D)  \nRow 5: *, ⇔, *, *, ∈ → third is * (C)  \nRow 6: ∈, ⇔, ⇔, ⇔, ∞ → third is ⇔ (A)  \nRow 7: ∞, ⇔, ∞, *, * → third is ∞ (D)  \nRow 8: *, ∈, ∞, ⇔, ⇔ → third is ∞ (D)  \nRow 9: *, ⇔, ∈, ∈, * → third is ∈ (B)  \n\nSo column 3 symbols are C, B, C, D, C, A, D, D, B → which is 3 Cs, 2 Bs, 3 Ds, 1 A. Which gives 3*(-29) + 2*(-48) + 3*25 +18. As before. Which is -87 -96 +75 +18 = -183 +93 = -90. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, column 4: fourth symbol in each row.\n\nRow 1: ∞ (D)  \nRow 2: * (C)  \nRow 3: ∞ (D)  \nRow 4: ∞ (D)  \nRow 5: * (C)  \nRow 6: ⇔ (A)  \nRow 7: * (C)  \nRow 8: ⇔ (A)  \nRow 9: ∈ (B)  \n\nWait, no, column 4 is the fourth symbol. Let me check:\n\nRow 1: fourth symbol is ∞ (D)  \nRow 2: fourth symbol is * (C)  \nRow 3: fourth symbol is ∞ (D)  \nRow 4: fourth symbol is ∞ (D)  \nRow 5: fourth symbol is * (C)  \nRow 6: fourth symbol is ⇔ (A)  \nRow 7: fourth symbol is * (C)  \nRow 8: fourth symbol is ⇔ (A)  \nRow 9: fourth symbol is ∈ (B)  \n\nSo symbols: D, C, D, D, C, A, C, A, B → which is 3 Ds, 3 Cs, 2 As, 1 B. So sum is 3*25 +3*(-29) +2*18 + (-48) → same as before. Correct.\n\nColumn 5: fifth symbol in each row.\n\nRow 1: ∈ (B)  \nRow 2: ⇔ (A)  \nRow 3: ∞ (D)  \nRow 4: ⇔ (A)  \nRow 5: ∈ (B)  \nRow 6: ∞ (D)  \nRow 7: * (C)  \nRow 8: ⇔ (A)  \nRow 9: * (C)  \n\nSo symbols: B, A, D, A, B, D, C, A, C → which is 2 Bs, 3 As, 2 Ds, 2 Cs. Sum as before.\n\nSo all columns are correctly calculated. Therefore, the final answer is the list of column sums: [-78, -10, -90, -24, -50].\n ;Answer: [-78, -10, -90, -24, -50]"

      "Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have a grid with symbols and each row's sum is given. Our task is to find the sum of each column. Hmm. First, I need to assign numerical values to each symbol. But how?\n\nLet me look at the grid again. Each row has symbols and a total sum. The symbols are ♠, √, ↑, &, and maybe others. Wait, let me check the grid again:\n\nFirst row: ♠√♠↑√ -403\nSecond: &√√&√ -110\nThird: √♠♠√√ -450\nFourth: ♠√&♠& -130\nFifth: &&↑&√ 97\nSixth: &√&&↑ 97\n\nSo the symbols present are ♠, √, ↑, &. Each of these symbols has a certain value. Since each row's sum is given, I can set up equations for each row and solve for the variables.\n\nLet me assign variables to each symbol:\n\nLet’s say:\n♠ = A\n√ = B\n↑ = C\n& = D\n\nSo now, each row can be converted into an equation.\n\nFirst row: ♠√♠↑√ = A + B + A + C + B = 2A + 2B + C = -403\n\nSecond row: &√√&√ = D + B + B + D + B = 2D + 3B = -110\n\nThird row: √♠♠√√ = B + A + A + B + B = 2A + 3B = -450\n\nFourth row: ♠√&♠& = A + B + D + A + D = 2A + 2D + B = -130\n\nFifth row: &&↑&√ = D + D + C + D + B = 3D + B + C = 97\n\nSixth row: &√&&↑ = D + B + D + D + C = 3D + B + C = 97\n\nWait, fifth and sixth rows have the same equation? Let me check:\n\nFifth row symbols: &&↑&√ → D, D, C, D, B → sum is 3D + B + C = 97\n\nSixth row symbols: &√&&↑ → D, B, D, D, C → same as 3D + B + C. So yes, same equation. That's interesting. So that gives us that both equations are same, which is expected, so no new information there. So maybe we can ignore one of them since they are redundant.\n\nSo now, we have the following equations:\n\n1) 2A + 2B + C = -403\n2) 2D + 3B = -110\n3) 2A + 3B = -450\n4) 2A + 2D + B = -130\n5) 3D + B + C = 97\n\nSo five equations with four variables. Let me see if I can solve these equations.\n\nFirst, let's look at equations 2 and 3. Equation 3 is 2A + 3B = -450. Equation 1 is 2A + 2B + C = -403. If I subtract equation 3 from equation 1, I get:\n\n(2A + 2B + C) - (2A + 3B) = -403 - (-450)\nWhich is ( -B + C ) = 47 → C = B + 47.\n\nSo equation 1 gives us C in terms of B.\n\nNow, equation 5 is 3D + B + C = 97. Substitute C:\n\n3D + B + (B +47) = 97 → 3D + 2B +47 = 97 → 3D + 2B = 50 → equation 5a.\n\nNow equation 2 is 2D +3B = -110.\n\nSo equations 2 and 5a:\n\nEquation 2: 2D + 3B = -110\n\nEquation 5a: 3D + 2B = 50\n\nWe can solve these two equations for D and B. Let me write them:\n\nLet me use substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination.\n\nMultiply equation 2 by 3: 6D + 9B = -330\n\nMultiply equation 5a by 2: 6D +4B = 100\n\nSubtract the second from the first:\n\n(6D +9B) - (6D +4B) = -330 - 100 → 5B = -430 → B = -86.\n\nNow plug B = -86 into equation 5a: 3D + 2*(-86) = 50 → 3D -172 = 50 → 3D = 222 → D = 74.\n\nNow, check equation 2: 2*74 +3*(-86) = 148 -258 = -110. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, B is -86. Now, from equation 3: 2A +3B = -450. So 2A +3*(-86) = -450 → 2A -258 = -450 → 2A = -450 +258 = -192 → A = -96.\n\nNow, from equation 1: C = B +47 → C = -86 +47 = -39.\n\nSo now, we have:\n\nA (♠) = -96\n\nB (√) = -86\n\nC (↑) = -39\n\nD (&) = 74\n\nLet me check if these values satisfy the other equations.\n\nEquation 4: 2A + 2D + B = ?\n\n2*(-96) + 2*(74) + (-86) = -192 + 148 -86 = (-192 +148) = -44 -86 = -130. Which matches the fourth row's sum of -130. Good.\n\nEquation 5: 3D + B + C = 3*74 + (-86) + (-39) = 222 -86 -39 = 222 - 125 = 97. Correct.\n\nNow, fifth and sixth rows are same, so they are okay.\n\nNow, with all variables known, we need to compute the column sums.\n\nThe grid has 5 rows (wait, original grid has 6 rows?), let me check the grid again:\n\nThe given grid has six rows. Each row has five symbols. So the grid is 6 rows by 5 columns. Therefore, there are 5 columns. We need to compute the sum of each column.\n\nLet me list each row's symbols and their corresponding values:\n\nRow 1: ♠√♠↑√ → A, B, A, C, B → values: -96, -86, -96, -39, -86.\n\nRow 2: &√√&√ → D, B, B, D, B → 74, -86, -86, 74, -86.\n\nRow 3: √♠♠√√ → B, A, A, B, B → -86, -96, -96, -86, -86.\n\nRow 4: ♠√&♠& → A, B, D, A, D → -96, -86, 74, -96, 74.\n\nRow 5: &&↑&√ → D, D, C, D, B → 74, 74, -39, 74, -86.\n\nRow 6: &√&&↑ → D, B, D, D, C → 74, -86, 74, 74, -39.\n\nNow, to compute the column sums. Each column is the sum of the elements in that column across all rows. Since there are 5 columns (each row has 5 symbols), columns 1 to 5.\n\nLet me process each column:\n\nColumn 1: positions (row 1, column 1), (row 2, column 1), ..., (row 6, column 1).\n\nLooking at each row's first symbol:\n\nRow 1: A (-96)\nRow 2: D (74)\nRow 3: B (-86)\nRow 4: A (-96)\nRow 5: D (74)\nRow 6: D (74)\nSo column 1 sum is: (-96) +74 + (-86) + (-96) +74 +74.\n\nLet me calculate:\n\nStart adding step by step:\n\n-96 +74 = -22\n\n-22 + (-86) = -108\n\n-108 + (-96) = -204\n\n-204 +74 = -130\n\n-130 +74 = -56.

      "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the column sums based on the given grid and row sums. The grid has symbols like ∝, ∅, ↑, ♣, and each symbol represents a numerical value. Each row's total is given, and I need to find the column totals.\n\nFirst, I should note how many columns there are. Let me count the symbols in each row. Each row has 9 symbols. So there are 9 columns. The answer should be a list of 9 numbers, each representing the sum of each column.\n\nBut how do I find the value of each symbol? Wait, maybe each symbol has a unique value, and the row sums are the sum of their symbols. But since there are multiple symbols, perhaps there's a system of equations here. Let's think.\n\nLet me assign variables to each symbol. Let's say:\n\nLet’s denote each unique symbol with a variable:\n\nLet’s say:\n- ∝ = A\n- ∅ = B\n- ↑ = C\n- ♣ = D\n\nSo the symbols are A, B, C, D.\n\nNow, each row is a sequence of these symbols, and their sum equals the given row total. Let's write equations for each row.\n\nLooking at the first row: ∝ ∅ ↑ ∝ ↑ ↑ ↑ ∅ ∝ with sum 50. So translating to variables:\n\nRow 1: A + B + C + A + C + C + C + B + A = 50. Let me count how many of each symbol here. There are three A's (positions 1,4,9), two B's (positions 2,8), and four C's (positions 3,5,6,7). So equation: 3A + 2B + 4C = 50.\n\nRow 2: ♣ ∝ ∝ ∝ ∝ ♣ ♣ ∝ ♣ with sum 316. Translating to symbols: D, A, A, A, A, D, D, A, D. So count: D appears 1 + 2 + 1 + 1? Wait, symbols are D, A, A, A, A, D, D, A, D. Let me count:\n\nD occurs in positions 1,6,7,9 → that's four D's. A occurs in positions 2-5 and 8 → five A's. So equation: 5A + 4D = 316.\n\nRow 3: ∅ ∅ ∅ ∝ ∅ ∅ ∝ ♣ ↑ with sum -75. Translating to B, B, B, A, B, B, A, D, C. So B's count: positions 1,2,3,5,6 → five B's. A's: positions 4,7 → two A's. D: position 8. C: position 9. Equation: 5B + 2A + D + C = -75.\n\nRow 4: ↑ ↑ ∅ ∅ ∝ ♣ ∅ ↑ ♣ with sum -190. Symbols: C, C, B, B, A, D, B, C, D. Let's count:\n\nC's: positions 1,2,8 → three C's. B's: positions 3,4,7 → three B's. A: position 5. D: positions 6,9 → two D's. So equation: 3C + 3B + A + 2D = -190.\n\nRow 5: ∝ ↑ ♣ ↑ ∝ ∝ ∅ ∅ ∅ with sum 52. Symbols: A, C, D, C, A, A, B, B, B. Let's count:\n\nA: positions 1,5,6 → three A's. C: positions 2,4 → two C's. D: position 3. B: positions 7,8,9 → three B's. Equation: 3A + 2C + D + 3B = 52.\n\nSo now, we have five equations:\n\nEquation 1: 3A + 2B + 4C = 50\n\nEquation 2: 5A + 4D = 316\n\nEquation 3: 5B + 2A + D + C = -75\n\nEquation 4: 3C + 3B + A + 2D = -190\n\nEquation 5: 3A + 2C + D + 3B = 52\n\nWait, Equations 3 and 5 seem similar. Let me check:\n\nEquation 3: 5B + 2A + D + C = -75\n\nEquation 5: 3A + 3B + 2C + D = 52 (since 3A + 2C + D + 3B is same as 3A +3B +2C +D)\n\nSo we have five equations with four variables. Hmm, but there are four variables (A, B, C, D) and five equations. That suggests that there might be redundant equations or maybe some inconsistency. Let's try solving the equations.\n\nLet me list the equations again:\n\n1) 3A + 2B + 4C = 50\n\n2) 5A + 4D = 316\n\n3) 2A + 5B + C + D = -75\n\n4) A + 3B + 3C + 2D = -190\n\n5) 3A + 3B + 2C + D = 52\n\nSo equations 3,4,5 are three equations with variables A, B, C, D.\n\nBut equation 2 is another equation involving A and D. Equation 1 is another with A, B, C.\n\nLet me try to solve these equations step by step.\n\nFirst, equation 2: 5A +4D =316. Let's solve for D in terms of A.\n\nFrom equation 2: 4D = 316 -5A → D = (316 -5A)/4.\n\nNow, let's substitute D into other equations.\n\nLooking at equation 3: 2A +5B + C + D = -75. Substitute D:\n\n2A +5B + C + (316 -5A)/4 = -75.\n\nMultiply all terms by 4 to eliminate denominator:\n\n8A +20B +4C +316 -5A = -300 → (8A -5A) +20B +4C +316 = -300 → 3A +20B +4C = -300 -316 = -616.\n\nEquation 3 transformed: 3A +20B +4C = -616. Let's call this equation 3a.\n\nEquation 5: 3A +3B +2C +D =52. Substitute D:\n\n3A +3B +2C + (316 -5A)/4 =52. Multiply all by 4:\n\n12A +12B +8C +316 -5A = 208 → (12A -5A) +12B +8C +316 =208 →7A +12B +8C = 208 -316 → 7A +12B +8C = -108. Let's call this equation 5a.\n\nEquation 4: A +3B +3C +2D =-190. Substitute D:\n\nA +3B +3C +2*(316 -5A)/4 = -190 → A +3B +3C + (316 -5A)/2 = -190.\n\nMultiply all by 2 to eliminate denominator:\n\n2A +6B +6C +316 -5A = -380 → (2A -5A) +6B +6C +316 = -380 → -3A +6B +6C = -380 -316 → -3A +6B +6C = -696. Divide both sides by 3:\n\n- A + 2B + 2C = -232. Let's call this equation 4a.\n\nNow, let's look at the equations we have:\n\nEquation 1: 3A +2B +4C =50\n\nEquation 3a: 3A +20B +4C =-616\n\nEquation 4a: -A +2B +2C =-232\n\nEquation 5a:7A +12B +8C =-108\n\nHmm. Let's see if we can subtract equation 1 from equation 3a to eliminate some variables.\n\nEquation 3a - equation 1:\n\n(3A +20B +4C) - (3A +2B +4C) = -616 -50 → 18B = -666 → B = -666 /18 = -37.\n\nSo B = -37.\n\nGreat! Now that we have B, let's substitute into other equations.\n\nFirst, equation 4a: -A +2B +2C =-232. Substitute B=-37:\n\n-A +2*(-37) +2C = -232 → -A -74 +2C = -232 → -A +2C = -232 +74 → -A +2C = -158 → 2C = A -158 → C = (A -158)/2.\n\nLet me note that as equation 6: C = (A -158)/2.\n\nNow, equation 1: 3A +2B +4C =50. Substitute B=-37 and C=(A-158)/2.\n\nSo:\n\n3A +2*(-37) +4*( (A -158)/2 ) =50 → 3A -74 + 2*(A -158) =50 → 3A -74 +2A -316 =50 → 5A -390 =50 →5A= 440 → A=88.\n\nSo A=88. Now, substitute back into equation 6 for C:\n\nC = (88 -158)/2 = (-70)/2 = -35.\n\nSo C = -35.\n\nNow, from equation 2, D = (316 -5A)/4. A is 88:\n\nD = (316 - 5*88)/4 = (316 -440)/4 = (-124)/4 = -31.\n\nSo D=-31.\n\nNow, we have all variables:\n\nA=88, B=-37, C=-35, D=-31.\n\nLet me verify these values with the equations to make sure.\n\nCheck equation 1: 3A +2B +4C = 3*88 + 2*(-37) +4*(-35) = 264 -74 -140 = 264-214=50. Correct.\n\nEquation 2: 5*88 +4*(-31) = 440 -124 = 316. Correct.\n\nEquation 3: 2A +5B +C +D = 2*88 +5*(-37) + (-35) + (-31) = 176 -185 -35 -31 = 176 - 251 = -75. Correct.\n\nEquation 4: A +3B +3C +2D = 88 +3*(-37) +3*(-35) +2*(-31) = 88 -111 -105 -62 = 88 - 278 = -190. Correct.\n\nEquation 5: 3A +3B +2C +D = 3*88 +3*(-37) +2*(-35) + (-31) = 264 -111 -70 -31 = 264 -212 = 52. Correct. All equations are satisfied. Great.\n\nNow that we have the values for each symbol:\n\nA (∝) =88\n\nB (∅) =-37\n\nC (↑) =-35\n\nD (♣) =-31\n\nNow, the next step is to compute the column sums. The grid has 5 rows and 9 columns. For each column, sum the symbols in that column across all rows.\n\nBut to do this, I need to know which symbol is in each column position for each row. Let me reconstruct the grid with the symbols and then compute each column's sum.\n\nThe grid is given as:\n\nRow 1: ∝ ∅ ↑ ∝ ↑ ↑ ↑ ∅ ∝ → [A, B, C, A, C, C, C, B, A]\n\nRow 2: ♣ ∝ ∝ ∝ ∝ ♣ ♣ ∝ ♣ → [D, A, A, A, A, D, D, A, D]\n\nRow 3: ∅ ∅ ∅ ∝ ∅ ∅ ∝ ♣ ↑ → [B, B, B, A, B, B, A, D, C]\n\nRow 4: ↑ ↑ ∅ ∅ ∝ ♣ ∅ ↑ ♣ → [C, C, B, B, A, D, B, C, D]\n\nRow 5: ∝ ↑ ♣ ↑ ∝ ∝ ∅ ∅ ∅ → [A, C, D, C, A, A, B, B, B]\n\nNow, let's list each column (columns 1 to 9) and their symbols:\n\nColumn 1: Row1: A, Row2: D, Row3: B, Row4: C, Row5: A → symbols: A, D, B, C, A.\n\nColumn 2: Row1: B, Row2: A, Row3: B, Row4: C, Row5: C → symbols: B, A, B, C, C.\n\nColumn 3: Row1: C, Row2: A, Row3: B, Row4: B, Row5: D → symbols: C, A, B, B, D.\n\nColumn 4: Row1: A, Row2: A, Row3: A, Row4: B, Row5: C → symbols: A, A, A, B, C.\n\nColumn 5: Row1: C, Row2: A, Row3: B, Row4: A, Row5: A → symbols: C, A, B, A, A.\n\nColumn 6: Row1: C, Row2: D, Row3: B, Row4: D, Row5: A → symbols: C, D, B, D, A.\n\nColumn 7: Row1: C, Row2: D, Row3: A, Row4: B, Row5: B → symbols: C, D, A, B, B.\n\nColumn 8: Row1: B, Row2: A, Row3: D, Row4: C, Row5: B → symbols: B, A, D, C, B.\n\nColumn 9: Row1: A, Row2: D, Row3: C, Row4: D, Row5: B → symbols: A, D, C, D, B.\n\nNow, compute each column's sum by substituting the values of A, B, C, D.\n\nLet's compute each column:\n\nColumn 1: A + D + B + C + A = 2A + B + C + D.\n\nSubstituting values: 2*88 + (-37) + (-35) + (-31) = 176 -37 -35 -31 = 176 - 103 = 73.\n\nColumn 2: B + A + B + C + C = A + 2B + 2C.\n\nSubstituting: 88 + 2*(-37) + 2*(-35) = 88 -74 -70 = 88 -144 = -56.\n\nColumn 3: C + A + B + B + D = A + 2B + C + D.\n\nSubstituting: 88 + 2*(-37) + (-35) + (-31) = 88 -74 -35 -31 = 88 - 140 = -52.\n\nColumn 4: A + A + A + B + C = 3A + B + C.\n\nSubstituting: 3*88 + (-37) + (-35) = 264 -72 = 192.\n\nColumn 5: C + A + B + A + A = 3A + B + C.\n\nSame as column 4? Let's check:\n\nSymbols: C, A, B, A, A → sum is A + A + A + B + C = 3A + B + C. So yes, same as column 4. So 3*88 + (-37) + (-35) = 264 -72 = 192. Wait, but column 4 and 5 have same sum? Let me confirm.\n\nYes, because column 4 and column 5 both have three A's, one B, one C. So same sum. So column 5 is 192.\n\nColumn 6: C + D + B + D + A = A + B + C + 2D.\n\nSubstituting: 88 + (-37) + (-35) + 2*(-31) = 88 -37 -35 -62 = 88 - 134 = -46.\n\nColumn 7: C + D + A + B + B = A + 2B + C + D.\n\nSame as column 3? Let's check:\n\nSymbols: C, D, A, B, B → sum is A + 2B + C + D. Which is same as column 3. So 88 + 2*(-37) + (-35) + (-31) = 88 -74 -35 -31 = same as column 3: -52.\n\nColumn 8: B + A + D + C + B = A + 2B + C + D.\n\nSame as column 3 and 7. So again, -52?\n\nWait, symbols: B, A, D, C, B. Sum is A + 2B + C + D. So yes, same as column 3. So sum is -52.\n\nWait, but column 8? Let me check again.\n\nColumn 8: B (Row1), A (Row2), D (Row3), C (Row4), B (Row5). So B + A + D + C + B = A + 2B + C + D. So yes, same as column 3. So sum is -52.\n\nColumn 9: A + D + C + D + B = A + B + 2D + C.\n\nSubstituting: 88 + (-37) + 2*(-31) + (-35) = 88 -37 -62 -35 = 88 - 134 = -46.\n\nSo compiling all the column sums:\n\nColumn 1: 73\n\nColumn 2: -56\n\nColumn 3: -52\n\nColumn 4: 192\n\nColumn 5: 192\n\nColumn 6: -46\n\nColumn 7: -52\n\nColumn 8: -52\n\nColumn 9: -46\n\nWait, let me verify each calculation again to avoid mistakes.\n\nColumn 1: 2A + B + C + D.\n\nA=88, B=-37, C=-35, D=-31.\n\n2*88 = 176. 176 + (-37) = 139. 139 + (-35) = 104. 104 + (-31) = 73. Correct.\n\nColumn 2: A + 2B + 2C. 88 + 2*(-37) + 2*(-35) = 88 -74 -70 = 88 -144 = -56. Correct.\n\nColumn 3: A + 2B + C + D. 88 + 2*(-37) + (-35) + (-31) = 88 -74 -35 -31 = 88 -140 = -52. Correct.\n\nColumn 4: 3A + B + C. 3*88=264. 264 + (-37) = 227. 227 + (-35)=192. Correct.\n\nColumn 5: same as column 4: 192. Correct.\n\nColumn 6: A + B + C + 2D. 88 + (-37) + (-35) + 2*(-31) = 88 -37=51, 51-35=16, 16-62= -46. Correct.\n\nColumn 7: same as column 3: -52. Correct.\n\nColumn 8: same as column 3: -52. Correct.\n\nColumn 9: A + B + 2D + C. 88 + (-37) + 2*(-31) + (-35) = 88-37=51, 51-62= -11, -11-35= -46. Correct.\n\nSo the column sums are:\n\n[73, -56, -52, 192, 192, -46, -52, -52, -46]\n\nNow, check if the sum of all column sums equals the sum of all row sums. Let's see:\n\nSum of row sums: 50 + 316 + (-75) + (-190) +52 = 50 + 316 = 366; 366 -75=291; 291 -190=101; 101 +52=153.\n\nSum of column sums: 73 + (-56) + (-52) + 192 + 192 + (-46) + (-52) + (-52) + (-46).\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nStart with 73.\n\n73 -56 = 17.\n\n17 -52 = -35.\n\n-35 +192 = 157.\n\n157 +192 = 349.\n\n349 -46 = 303.\n\n303 -52 = 251.\n\n251 -52 = 199.\n\n199 -46 = 153. Which matches the sum of row sums. So that's a good check. Therefore, the column sums are correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be [73, -56, -52, 192, 192, -46, -52, -52, -46].\n\nLet me double-check the columns again to make sure I didn't mix up any columns.\n\nFor example, column 7: symbols are C (row1), D (row2), A (row3), B (row4), B (row5). So C + D + A + B + B = A + 2B + C + D. Which is same as column3. Which is correct.\n\nColumn 8: symbols B, A, D, C, B. Which is same as A + 2B + C + D. Correct.\n\nColumn 9: A, D, C, D, B. So A + B + 2D + C. Correct.\n\nYes, all columns are correctly calculated. So the final answer is the list of column sums as above.\n ;Answer: [73, -56, -52, 192, 192, -46, -52, -52, -46]"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the column sums based on the given grid and row sums. Each symbol in the grid represents a numerical value. The rows are provided with their total sums, and I need to compute the column sums. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grid structure. Each row seems to have symbols separated by spaces, and each row ends with a number which is the sum of that row. The grid has 6 rows. Let me count the number of columns. Let me look at each row:\n\nFirst row: \"+♣/♣//←♣/ 558\" – Let's split the symbols. Let's see: +, ♣, /, ♣, /, /, ←, ♣, / → that's 9 symbols? Wait, maybe I need to split properly. Wait, maybe each row has symbols separated by some characters. Wait, the input is given as a grid where each line is a sequence of symbols followed by the row sum. Let me check each row's length.\n\nLooking at the first row: \"+♣/♣//←♣/ 558\". The symbols before the space are \"+♣/♣//←♣/\". Let's count the characters here. Let's split into individual symbols. But how many symbols are there? Each symbol is a single character? Like '+', '♣', '/', etc. So each position in the grid is a single character. For example, the first row's symbols are 9 characters long (before the space). Let me check the other rows.\n\nSecond row: \"∆+←♣∆♣♣♣← 425\" → symbols are \"∆+←♣∆♣♣♣←\", which is 9 characters. Third row: \"♣/+/♣←+// 479\" → 9 symbols. Fourth: \"←+∆++/∆♣/ 308\" → 9. Fifth: \"←♣+∆♣∆←/← 300\" → 9. Sixth: \"+∆∆←/←/←♣ 272\" → 9. So each row has 9 symbols, and each column is 6 entries. Therefore, there are 9 columns. The task is to compute the sum for each of the 9 columns.\n\nBut how do I find the value of each symbol? Since each row's sum is given, perhaps we can set up equations. However, with symbols possibly repeating, this could be complex. But maybe there's a way to find the column sums without knowing each symbol's individual value. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total sum of all rows equals the total sum of all columns. Let me think. The total sum of all rows is the sum of each row's total. Let me calculate that first. Let's add 558 + 425 + 479 + 308 + 300 + 272. Let me compute that:\n\n558 + 425 = 983; 983 + 479 = 1462; 1462 + 308 = 1770; 1770 + 300 = 2070; 2070 + 272 = 2342. So total sum across all rows is 2342. Therefore, the sum of all columns must also add up to 2342. But how does that help me find each column's sum? Well, if I can find each column's sum, their total must be 2342. But how to find individual column sums?\n\nBut without knowing the individual symbol values, how can I compute column sums? Unless there's some other information. Wait, perhaps each symbol is unique? Or maybe there's a pattern. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to represent each column's sum based on the rows. But I'm stuck here.\n\nWait, maybe there's another approach. Let me consider that each column's sum is the sum of the elements in that column. Since each row's sum is known, perhaps I can set up a system of equations. Let me denote each column's sum as C1, C2, ..., C9. Then the sum of C1 through C9 is 2342. But how else can I relate them?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the value of each symbol by solving equations from the rows. For example, each row is an equation where the sum of its symbols equals the given row sum. If I can find the value of each symbol, then I can compute the column sums by adding the symbols in each column.\n\nBut there are 6 rows and multiple symbols. Let me check how many unique symbols there are. Looking at the grid:\n\nSymbols present: '+', '♣', '/', '←', '∆', and maybe others? Let me check all symbols in the grid:\n\nFirst row: +, ♣, /, ♣, /, /, ←, ♣, /\nSecond row: ∆, +, ←, ♣, ∆, ♣, ♣, ♣, ←\nThird row: ♣, /, +, /, ♣, ←, +, /, /\nFourth row: ←, +, ∆, +, +, /, ∆, ♣, /\nFifth row: ←, ♣, +, ∆, ♣, ∆, ←, /, ←\nSixth row: +, ∆, ∆, ←, /, ←, /, ←, ♣\n\nSo the symbols are: '+', '♣', '/', '←', '∆', and maybe others? Let me list them all. Let me count:\n\nSymbols are: '+', '♣', '/', '←', '∆', and maybe others? Let me check each row again. For example, in the first row, symbols are +, ♣, /, ♣, /, /, ←, ♣, /. So those are the symbols. Second row has ∆, +, ←, ♣, ∆, ♣, etc. So the unique symbols are '+', '♣', '/', '←', '∆'. Are there others? Let me check all. The fifth row has ←, ♣, +, ∆, ♣, ∆, ←, /, ←. So no new symbols. The sixth row: +, ∆, ∆, ←, /, ←, /, ←, ♣. So yes, the symbols are '+', '♣', '/', '←', '∆'. Five different symbols.\n\nSo there are five variables (each symbol's value) and six equations (each row's sum). That should be solvable. Let me try to set up equations for each row.\n\nLet me assign variables:\n\nLet A = '+', B = '♣', C = '/', D = '←', E = '∆'.\n\nEach row's symbols can be converted into a sum of these variables. Let's process each row:\n\nRow 1: \"+♣/♣//←♣/\" → A, B, C, B, C, C, D, B, C → sum is A + B + C + B + C + C + D + B + C = A + 3B + 5C + D = 558.\n\nRow 2: \"∆+←♣∆♣♣♣←\" → E, A, D, B, E, B, B, B, D → E + A + D + B + E + B + B + B + D = A + 4B + 2D + 2E = 425.\n\nRow 3: \"♣/+/♣←+//\" → B, C, A, C, B, D, A, C, C → B + C + A + C + B + D + A + C + C = 2A + 2B + 5C + D = 479.\n\nRow 4: \"←+∆++/∆♣/\" → D, A, E, A, A, C, E, B, C → D + A + E + A + A + C + E + B + C = 3A + B + 2C + D + 2E = 308.\n\nRow 5: \"←♣+∆♣∆←/←\" → D, B, A, E, B, E, D, C, D → D + B + A + E + B + E + D + C + D = A + 2B + C + 3D + 2E = 300.\n\nRow 6: \"+∆∆←/←/←♣\" → A, E, E, D, C, D, C, D, B → A + 2E + D + C + D + C + D + B = A + B + 2C + 3D + 2E = 272.\n\nSo now we have six equations:\n\n1. A + 3B + 5C + D = 558\n2. A + 4B + 2D + 2E = 425\n3. 2A + 2B + 5C + D = 479\n4. 3A + B + 2C + D + 2E = 308\n5. A + 2B + C + 3D + 2E = 300\n6. A + B + 2C + 3D + 2E = 272\n\nHmm, solving this system might be complex, but let's try. Let me note the equations:\n\nEquation 1: A + 3B + 5C + D = 558\n\nEquation 3: 2A + 2B + 5C + D = 479\n\nIf I subtract equation 1 from equation 3:\n\n(2A + 2B + 5C + D) - (A + 3B + 5C + D) = 479 - 558 → A - B = -79 → A = B -79. Let's note this as equation 7: A = B -79.\n\nNow, let's look at equations 2, 4, 5, 6. Let's see if we can find relations.\n\nLet me also check equations 5 and 6. Equation 5: A + 2B + C + 3D + 2E = 300. Equation 6: A + B + 2C + 3D + 2E = 272. Subtract equation 6 from equation 5:\n\n(A + 2B + C + 3D + 2E) - (A + B + 2C + 3D + 2E) = 300 - 272 → B - C = 28 → B = C + 28. Let's note this as equation 8: B = C +28.\n\nFrom equation 7, A = B -79. Substituting equation 8 into this: A = (C +28) -79 → A = C -51. So equation 9: A = C -51.\n\nNow, let's try to express equations in terms of C and D and E.\n\nLet me take equation 1: A +3B +5C +D =558. Substitute A and B:\n\nA = C-51, B = C+28.\n\nSo:\n\n(C-51) + 3*(C+28) +5C + D = 558.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nC -51 + 3C + 84 +5C + D = 558 → (C +3C +5C) + (-51 +84) + D = 558 → 9C +33 + D = 558 → 9C + D = 558 -33 = 525 → equation 10: 9C + D = 525.\n\nNow, equation 3: 2A +2B +5C +D =479. Substitute A and B:\n\n2*(C-51) + 2*(C+28) +5C + D = 479.\n\nCompute:\n\n2C -102 + 2C +56 +5C + D = 479 → (2C +2C +5C) + (-102 +56) + D = 479 → 9C -46 + D = 479 → 9C + D = 479 +46 = 525. Which matches equation 10. So no new info here.\n\nNow, moving to equation 4: 3A + B +2C + D + 2E =308. Substitute A and B:\n\n3*(C-51) + (C+28) +2C + D + 2E = 308.\n\nCompute:\n\n3C -153 + C +28 +2C + D + 2E = 308 → (3C + C +2C) + (-153 +28) + D + 2E = 308 → 6C -125 + D + 2E = 308 → 6C + D + 2E = 308 +125 = 433 → equation 11: 6C + D + 2E = 433.\n\nEquation 2: A +4B +2D +2E =425. Substitute A and B:\n\n(C-51) +4*(C+28) +2D +2E =425.\n\nCompute:\n\nC -51 +4C +112 +2D +2E = 425 → 5C +61 +2D +2E =425 → 5C +2D +2E =425 -61 = 364 → equation 12: 5C +2D +2E = 364.\n\nNow, let's look at equation 5: A +2B +C +3D +2E =300. Substitute A and B:\n\n(C-51) +2*(C+28) +C +3D +2E =300.\n\nCompute:\n\nC -51 +2C +56 +C +3D +2E = 300 → (C +2C +C) + (-51 +56) +3D +2E =300 →4C +5 +3D +2E =300 →4C +3D +2E =295 → equation 13: 4C +3D +2E =295.\n\nEquation 6: A + B +2C +3D +2E =272. Substitute A and B:\n\n(C-51) + (C+28) +2C +3D +2E =272.\n\nCompute:\n\nC -51 +C +28 +2C +3D +2E = 4C -23 +3D +2E =272 →4C +3D +2E =272 +23 = 295. Which matches equation 13. So again, same as equation 13.\n\nSo now, we have equations 10, 11, 12, and 13. Let me list them:\n\nEquation 10: 9C + D = 525.\n\nEquation 11: 6C + D + 2E = 433.\n\nEquation 12: 5C +2D +2E = 364.\n\nEquation 13: 4C +3D +2E = 295.\n\nHmm. Let me try to eliminate variables. Let's first use equation 10 to express D in terms of C. From equation 10: D = 525 -9C.\n\nNow substitute D into equations 11, 12, 13.\n\nEquation 11: 6C + (525 -9C) + 2E = 433 → (6C -9C) +525 +2E = 433 → -3C +525 +2E =433 → -3C +2E = 433 -525 = -92 → equation 14: -3C +2E = -92.\n\nEquation 12: 5C + 2*(525 -9C) +2E =364 → 5C +1050 -18C +2E =364 → -13C +1050 +2E =364 → -13C +2E = 364 -1050 = -686 → equation 15: -13C +2E = -686.\n\nEquation 13: 4C +3*(525 -9C) +2E =295 → 4C +1575 -27C +2E =295 → -23C +1575 +2E =295 → -23C +2E = 295 -1575 = -1280 → equation 16: -23C +2E = -1280.\n\nNow, we have equations 14, 15, 16:\n\nEquation 14: -3C +2E = -92.\n\nEquation 15: -13C +2E = -686.\n\nEquation 16: -23C +2E = -1280.\n\nLet me subtract equation 14 from equation 15:\n\n(-13C +2E) - (-3C +2E) = -686 - (-92) → -10C = -594 → C = 594 / 10 = 59.4. Wait, but this is a problem. The value of C is 59.4? That's a fractional number. But symbols are supposed to have numerical values. Maybe it's possible, but let me check if this is correct. Let me verify.\n\nEquation 15 minus equation 14:\n\n(-13C +2E) - (-3C +2E) = -686 +92 → -10C = -594 → C=59.4. Hmm. Let's proceed and see if other equations hold.\n\nNow, let's compute equation 15 and 14. Let me take equation 14: -3C +2E = -92. If C=59.4, then:\n\n-3*(59.4) +2E = -92 → -178.2 +2E = -92 → 2E = -92 +178.2 = 86.2 → E = 43.1.\n\nNow check equation 15: -13*(59.4) +2*(43.1) = ?\n\n-13*59.4 = let's compute 59.4*13. 59*13=767, 0.4*13=5.2 → total 772.2. So -772.2 + 86.2 = -686. Which matches equation 15. Good.\n\nNow check equation 16: -23C +2E = -1280. Let's plug C=59.4 and E=43.1.\n\n-23*59.4 = let's calculate 23*59.4. 20*59.4=1188, 3*59.4=178.2 → total 1366.2. So -1366.2 + 2*43.1 = -1366.2 +86.2 = -1280. Which matches equation 16. So yes, C=59.4, E=43.1.\n\nNow, with C known, we can find D from equation 10: D=525 -9C = 525 -9*(59.4) = 525 - 534.6 = -9.6.\n\nSo D = -9.6.\n\nNow, let's find B from equation 8: B = C +28 = 59.4 +28 = 87.4.\n\nA from equation 7: A = B -79 = 87.4 -79 = 8.4.\n\nSo now we have all variables:\n\nA = '+': 8.4\n\nB = '♣': 87.4\n\nC = '/': 59.4\n\nD = '←': -9.6\n\nE = '∆': 43.1\n\nNow, with these values, let's verify if they satisfy all the original equations. Let's check equation 2: A +4B +2D +2E =425.\n\nA=8.4, 4B=4*87.4=349.6, 2D=2*(-9.6)=-19.2, 2E=2*43.1=86.2. Sum: 8.4 + 349.6 = 358; 358 -19.2 = 338.8; 338.8 +86.2=425. Correct.\n\nCheck equation 4: 3A + B +2C + D + 2E = 3*8.4 +87.4 +2*59.4 + (-9.6) + 2*43.1.\n\nCalculate:\n\n3*8.4 =25.2; 25.2 +87.4=112.6; 2*59.4=118.8 → 112.6 +118.8=231.4; -9.6 → 231.4 -9.6=221.8; 2*43.1=86.2 → 221.8 +86.2=308. Correct. Which matches equation 4's value of 308.\n\nLooks good. Now, with all symbol values known, we can compute the column sums.\n\nEach column is the sum of the symbols in that column across all 6 rows. There are 9 columns. Let me process each column one by one.\n\nFirst, let's reconstruct the grid's symbols for each column. Let me list each row's symbols as a list of 9 elements. Let me parse each row:\n\nRow 1: \"+♣/♣//←♣/\" → symbols are [ '+', '♣', '/', '♣', '/', '/', '←', '♣', '/' ]\n\nRow 2: \"∆+←♣∆♣♣♣←\" → [ '∆', '+', '←', '♣', '∆', '♣', '♣', '♣', '←' ]\n\nRow 3: \"♣/+/♣←+//\" → [ '♣', '/', '+', '/', '♣', '←', '+', '/', '/' ]\n\nRow 4: \"←+∆++/∆♣/\" → [ '←', '+', '∆', '+', '+', '/', '∆', '♣', '/' ]\n\nRow 5: \"←♣+∆♣∆←/←\" → [ '←', '♣', '+', '∆', '♣', '∆', '←', '/', '←' ]\n\nRow 6: \"+∆∆←/←/←♣\" → [ '+', '∆', '∆', '←', '/', '←', '/', '←', '♣' ]\n\nNow, for each column index (0 to 8), collect the symbols from each row and sum their values.\n\nLet me create a list for each column:\n\nColumn 0 (first column of each row):\n\nRow1: '+', Row2: '∆', Row3: '♣', Row4: '←', Row5: '←', Row6: '+'\n\nColumn 0 symbols: '+', '∆', '♣', '←', '←', '+'\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow1: '♣', Row2: '+', Row3: '/', Row4: '+', Row5: '♣', Row6: '∆'\n\nColumn 1 symbols: '♣', '+', '/', '+', '♣', '∆'\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow1: '/', Row2: '←', Row3: '+', Row4: '∆', Row5: '+', Row6: '∆'\n\nSymbols: '/', '←', '+', '∆', '+', '∆'\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow1: '♣', Row2: '♣', Row3: '/', Row4: '+', Row5: '∆', Row6: '←'\n\nSymbols: '♣', '♣', '/', '+', '∆', '←'\n\nColumn 4:\n\nRow1: '/', Row2: '∆', Row3: '♣', Row4: '+', Row5: '♣', Row6: '/'\n\nSymbols: '/', '∆', '♣', '+', '♣', '/'\n\nColumn 5:\n\nRow1: '/', Row2: '♣', Row3: '←', Row4: '/', Row5: '∆', Row6: '←'\n\nSymbols: '/', '♣', '←', '/', '∆', '←'\n\nColumn 6:\n\nRow1: '←', Row2: '♣', Row3: '+', Row4: '∆', Row5: '←', Row6: '/'\n\nSymbols: '←', '♣', '+', '∆', '←', '/'\n\nColumn 7:\n\nRow1: '♣', Row2: '♣', Row3: '/', Row4: '♣', Row5: '/', Row6: '←'\n\nSymbols: '♣', '♣', '/', '♣', '/', '←'\n\nColumn 8:\n\nRow1: '/', Row2: '←', Row3: '/', Row4: '/', Row5: '←', Row6: '♣'\n\nSymbols: '/', '←', '/', '/', '←', '♣'\n\nNow, let's compute each column's sum.\n\nLet's start with Column 0:\n\nSymbols: '+', '∆', '♣', '←', '←', '+'\n\nValues: A, E, B, D, D, A.\n\nSum = A + E + B + D + D + A = 2A + B + E + 2D.\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\nA=8.4, B=87.4, E=43.1, D=-9.6.\n\nSo 2*8.4 +87.4 +43.1 + 2*(-9.6) = 16.8 +87.4 +43.1 -19.2 = Let's compute step by step:\n\n16.8 +87.4 = 104.2\n\n104.2 +43.1 = 147.3\n\n147.3 -19.2 = 128.1 → Column 0 sum is 128.1.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nSymbols: '♣', '+', '/', '+', '♣', '∆'\n\nValues: B, A, C, A, B, E.\n\nSum = B + A + C + A + B + E = 2A + 2B + C + E.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n2*8.4 + 2*87.4 +59.4 +43.1.\n\nCalculate:\n\n16.8 + 174.8 = 191.6; +59.4 = 251; +43.1 = 294.1 → Column 1 sum is 294.1.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nSymbols: '/', '←', '+', '∆', '+', '∆'\n\nValues: C, D, A, E, A, E.\n\nSum = C + D + A + E + A + E = 2A + 2E + C + D.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n2*8.4 + 2*43.1 +59.4 + (-9.6) = 16.8 + 86.2 +59.4 -9.6.\n\nCalculate:\n\n16.8 +86.2 = 103; 103 +59.4 = 162.4; 162.4 -9.6 = 152.8 → Column 2 sum is 152.8.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nSymbols: '♣', '♣', '/', '+', '∆', '←'\n\nValues: B, B, C, A, E, D.\n\nSum = B + B + C + A + E + D = 2B + C + A + E + D.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n2*87.4 +59.4 +8.4 +43.1 + (-9.6) = 174.8 +59.4 = 234.2 +8.4=242.6 +43.1=285.7 -9.6=276.1 → Column 3 sum is 276.1.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nSymbols: '/', '∆', '♣', '+', '♣', '/'\n\nValues: C, E, B, A, B, C.\n\nSum = C + E + B + A + B + C = 2C + 2B + A + E.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n2*59.4 + 2*87.4 +8.4 +43.1.\n\nCalculate:\n\n118.8 + 174.8 = 293.6 +8.4=302 +43.1=345.1 → Column 4 sum is 345.1.\n\nColumn 5:\n\nSymbols: '/', '♣', '←', '/', '∆', '←'\n\nValues: C, B, D, C, E, D.\n\nSum = C + B + D + C + E + D = 2C + B + 2D + E.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n2*59.4 +87.4 + 2*(-9.6) +43.1 = 118.8 +87.4 = 206.2 -19.2= 187 +43.1= 230.1 → Column 5 sum is 230.1.\n\nColumn 6:\n\nSymbols: '←', '♣', '+', '∆', '←', '/'\n\nValues: D, B, A, E, D, C.\n\nSum = D + B + A + E + D + C = 2D + B + A + E + C.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n2*(-9.6) +87.4 +8.4 +43.1 +59.4.\n\nCalculate:\n\n-19.2 +87.4 = 68.2 +8.4=76.6 +43.1=119.7 +59.4= 179.1 → Column 6 sum is 179.1.\n\nColumn 7:\n\nSymbols: '♣', '♣', '/', '♣', '/', '←'\n\nValues: B, B, C, B, C, D.\n\nSum = B + B + C + B + C + D = 3B + 2C + D.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n3*87.4 + 2*59.4 + (-9.6) = 262.2 + 118.8 = 381 -9.6 = 371.4 → Column 7 sum is 371.4.\n\nColumn 8:\n\nSymbols: '/', '←', '/', '/', '←', '♣'\n\nValues: C, D, C, C, D, B.\n\nSum = C + D + C + C + D + B = 3C + 2D + B.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n3*59.4 + 2*(-9.6) +87.4 = 178.2 -19.2 +87.4 = 159 +87.4 = 246.4 → Column 8 sum is 246.4.\n\nNow, let's collect all column sums:\n\nColumn 0: 128.1\n\nColumn 1: 294.1\n\nColumn 2: 152.8\n\nColumn 3: 276.1\n\nColumn 4: 345.1\n\nColumn 5: 230.1\n\nColumn 6: 179.1\n\nColumn 7: 371.4\n\nColumn 8: 246.4\n\nBut the problem says to output the column sums as a list. However, these are decimal numbers. But maybe there's a mistake in calculation? Or perhaps the values are supposed to be integers. Let me check if there's any error in my calculations.\n\nWait, the row sums are all integers. But when solving, we got fractional values. For example, C is 59.4. Maybe there's a mistake in the equations?\n\nLet me double-check the equations. Let me re-examine the equations setup.\n\nLooking back at equation 1 and equation 3.\n\nEquation 1: A +3B +5C + D =558.\n\nEquation 3: 2A +2B +5C + D =479.\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 3 gives A - B = -79 → A = B -79. That seems correct.\n\nThen equation 8: B = C +28. Correct.\n\nEquation 10: 9C + D =525. Correct.\n\nEquation 11: 6C + D + 2E =433. Correct.\n\nEquation 12: 5C +2D +2E =364. Correct.\n\nEquation 13:4C +3D +2E =295. Correct.\n\nThen solving for C, D, E, we got C=59.4, D=-9.6, E=43.1. Then A=8.4, B=87.4.\n\nLet me verify equation 1: A +3B +5C + D = 8.4 +3*87.4 +5*59.4 + (-9.6).\n\nCalculate:\n\n3*87.4 = 262.2; 5*59.4=297. So total is 8.4 +262.2 = 270.6 +297= 567.6 -9.6 = 558. Correct. So equation 1 holds.\n\nEquation 2: A +4B +2D +2E = 8.4 +4*87.4 +2*(-9.6) +2*43.1 = 8.4 + 349.6 = 358 -19.2 = 338.8 +86.2 = 425. Correct.\n\nEquation 4: 3A + B +2C + D + 2E = 3*8.4=25.2 +87.4 + 2*59.4=118.8 + (-9.6) + 86.2. Sum: 25.2 +87.4 = 112.6 +118.8=231.4 -9.6=221.8 +86.2=308. Correct.\n\nEquation 5: A +2B +C +3D +2E = 8.4 + 2*87.4=174.8 +59.4 +3*(-9.6)= -28.8 + 86.2. Sum: 8.4 +174.8=183.2 +59.4=242.6 -28.8=213.8 +86.2=300. Correct.\n\nEquation 6: A + B +2C +3D +2E = 8.4 +87.4 + 2*59.4=118.8 +3*(-9.6)= -28.8 +86.2. Sum: 8.4 +87.4=95.8 +118.8=214.6 -28.8=185.8 +86.2=272. Correct.\n\nAll equations are satisfied. So the symbol values are correct, even though they are decimal. Therefore, the column sums are as calculated.\n\nNow, the problem requires the column sums as a list. The user probably expects the answer in the format with numbers rounded or as they are. But since the example shows integers, perhaps there's an error. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in parsing the grid symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing the symbols for each column. Let me recheck the columns.\n\nLet me recheck column 0:\n\nRow1: '+', Row2: '∆', Row3: '♣', Row4: '←', Row5: '←', Row6: '+'. Yes. Correct.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow1: '♣', Row2: '+', Row3: '/', Row4: '+', Row5: '♣', Row6: '∆'. Correct.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow1: '/', Row2: '←', Row3: '+', Row4: '∆', Row5: '+', Row6: '∆'. Correct.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow1: '♣', Row2: '♣', Row3: '/', Row4: '+', Row5: '∆', Row6: '←'. Correct.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nRow1: '/', Row2: '∆', Row3: '♣', Row4: '+', Row5: '♣', Row6: '/'. Correct.\n\nColumn 5:\n\nRow1: '/', Row2: '♣', Row3: '←', Row4: '/', Row5: '∆', Row6: '←'. Correct.\n\nColumn 6:\n\nRow1: '←', Row2: '♣', Row3: '+', Row4: '∆', Row5: '←', Row6: '/'. Correct.\n\nColumn 7:\n\nRow1: '♣', Row2: '♣', Row3: '/', Row4: '♣', Row5: '/', Row6: '←'. Correct.\n\nColumn 8:\n\nRow1: '/', Row2: '←', Row3: '/', Row4: '/', Row5: '←', Row6: '♣'. Correct.\n\nSo the symbols per column are correct. Now the calculations for each column sum are as follows. Let me recheck one column's calculation to ensure no arithmetic errors.\n\nFor example, column 3 sum was calculated as 276.1. Let's recheck:\n\nSymbols: B, B, C, A, E, D.\n\nValues: 87.4 +87.4 +59.4 +8.4 +43.1 + (-9.6).\n\nAdding step by step:\n\n87.4 +87.4 = 174.8\n\n+59.4 = 234.2\n\n+8.4 = 242.6\n\n+43.1 = 285.7\n\n-9.6 = 276.1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: column 5 sum is 230.1. Symbols: C, B, D, C, E, D. Values: 59.4 +87.4 + (-9.6) +59.4 +43.1 + (-9.6). Let's compute:\n\n59.4 +87.4 = 146.8 -9.6 = 137.2 +59.4 = 196.6 +43.1 = 239.7 -9.6 = 230.1. Correct.\n\nNow, the column sums are decimal numbers. But the example given in the problem statement shows integers, e.g., \"Answer: [12,3,12,-15]\". This suggests that perhaps the actual answer should be integers. Maybe there's a mistake in my calculations or in the setup of equations. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects rounding to integers. However, given that the equations are satisfied with these decimal values, perhaps the answer is correct as is. But the problem might expect integer answers, which makes me think I may have made a mistake in parsing the grid.\n\nWait, let me check the grid again. Perhaps I miscounted the symbols in a row. For example, maybe a row has more or fewer symbols than I thought.\n\nLet me re-express the grid:\n\nRow 1: \"+♣/♣//←♣/ 558\" → the symbols are \"+♣/♣//←♣/\" → let's count each character:\n\n+ ♣ / ♣ / / ← ♣ / → that's 9 symbols. Correct.\n\nRow 2: ∆+←♣∆♣♣♣← → ∆ + ← ♣ ∆ ♣ ♣ ♣ ← → 9 symbols. Correct.\n\nRow 3: ♣/+/♣←+// → ♣ / + / ♣ ← + / / → 9 symbols. Correct.\n\nRow 4: ←+∆++/∆♣/ → ← + ∆ + + / ∆ ♣ / → 9. Correct.\n\nRow 5: ←♣+∆♣∆←/← → ← ♣ + ∆ ♣ ∆ ← / ← → 9. Correct.\n\nRow 6: +∆∆←/←/←♣ → + ∆ ∆ ← / ← / ← ♣ → 9. Correct.\n\nSo the grid is correct. Therefore, the decimal values are correct. However, the problem may require rounding to integers. But why would that be the case? Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations setup.\n\nLet me re-express the equations again. Let me check equation 5 again. For row 5: \"←♣+∆♣∆←/←\" → symbols D, B, A, E, B, E, D, C, D. Sum: D + B + A + E + B + E + D + C + D = A + 2B + C + 3D + 2E = 300. Which I think is correct. Yes.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the symbols are not single characters. For example, maybe \"←♣\" is a single symbol? But the problem says each symbol represents a numerical value. The grid is given with symbols like \"+\", \"♣\", \"/\", etc., each as individual characters. So I think the parsing is correct.\n\nGiven that, the column sums are as calculated. However, the problem might expect the answer in decimal form, or perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the column sums.\n\nLet me recheck column 0's sum:\n\nSymbols: '+', '∆', '♣', '←', '←', '+'\n\nValues: 8.4 (A), 43.1 (E), 87.4 (B), -9.6 (D), -9.6 (D), 8.4 (A).\n\nSum: 8.4 +43.1 = 51.5 +87.4 = 138.9 -9.6 = 129.3 -9.6 = 119.7 +8.4 = 128.1. Correct.\n\nAnother column: column 8: 3C + 2D + B = 3*59.4 + 2*(-9.6) +87.4 = 178.2 -19.2 +87.4 = 159 +87.4 = 246.4. Correct.\n\nBut since the example uses integers, maybe the problem expects rounding to the nearest integer. Let me check what happens if I round each column sum to one decimal place or to integers. However, the problem statement does not specify, but since the row sums are integers, but the column sums could be decimals. However, the example shows integers. This is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the equations. Let me think again. For example, perhaps I misread a symbol in a row. Let me recheck equation 1.\n\nRow 1: \"+♣/♣//←♣/ 558\" → symbols are '+', '♣', '/', '♣', '/', '/', '←', '♣', '/'. So equation is A + B + C + B + C + C + D + B + C. That is A + 3B + 5C + D. Correct. Yes.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the symbols are not unique. For example, maybe some symbols are the same but I considered them different. But no, the symbols are clearly distinct in the grid.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the problem is designed so that the column sums are integers, and my calculation has an error. Let me check if there's a mistake in solving the equations.\n\nLet me recheck the solving steps. After getting C=59.4, D=-9.6, E=43.1, A=8.4, B=87.4.\n\nLet me check equation 2 again: A +4B +2D +2E = 8.4 +4*87.4 + 2*(-9.6) + 2*43.1.\n\nCalculate:\n\n4*87.4 = 349.6; 2*(-9.6) = -19.2; 2*43.1 = 86.2.\n\nSo total is 8.4 +349.6 = 358 + (-19.2) = 338.8 +86.2 = 425. Correct.\n\nEquation 5: A +2B +C +3D +2E = 8.4 + 2*87.4 +59.4 + 3*(-9.6) + 2*43.1.\n\nCalculate:\n\n2*87.4 = 174.8 +59.4 = 234.2 + 8.4 = 242.6. 3*(-9.6) = -28.8 → 242.6 -28.8 = 213.8 + 86.2 = 300. Correct.\n\nSo the values are correct. Therefore, the column sums are indeed decimals. The example given in the problem may be a simplified case where the sums are integers, but in this problem, it's possible for the sums to be decimals.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is the list of these column sums. However, since the problem may expect the answer in a specific format, perhaps as integers, but I can't be sure. Given that the calculations are correct based on the equations, I'll proceed with the decimal values.\n\nBut the problem says \"each symbol represents a numerical value\". It doesn't specify that they are integers. So decimals are acceptable. Therefore, the answer should be as computed.\n\nBut the example shows integers, so perhaps I should round them to integers? Let me see what happens if I round each to one decimal place. The sums are:\n\n[128.1, 294.1, 152.8, 276.1, 345.1, 230.1, 179.1, 371.4, 246.4]\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in fractions. For example, C=59.4 is 594/10 = 297/5, D=-9.6 is -48/5, etc. But calculating the column sums as fractions might give exact values. Let me try this approach.\n\nLet me redo the calculations using fractions.\n\nFirst, C=59.4 = 594/10 = 297/5.\n\nD = -9.6 = -48/5.\n\nE=43.1 = 431/10.\n\nA=8.4 = 42/5.\n\nB=87.4 = 874/10 = 437/5.\n\nNow, let's compute each column sum as fractions.\n\nColumn 0: 2A + B + E + 2D.\n\nA=42/5, B=437/5, E=431/10, D=-48/5.\n\n2A = 84/5.\n\nB = 437/5.\n\nE = 431/10.\n\n2D = -96/5.\n\nTotal sum: 84/5 + 437/5 + 431/10 - 96/5.\n\nConvert all to tenths:\n\n84/5 = 168/10\n\n437/5 = 874/10\n\n431/10 = 431/10\n\n-96/5 = -192/10\n\nSum: 168 + 874 + 431 - 192 all over 10.\n\nCalculate numerator: 168 + 874 = 1042; 1042 +431 = 1473; 1473 -192 = 1281. So 1281/10 = 128.1. Same as before.\n\nColumn 1: 2A + 2B + C + E.\n\n2A = 84/5, 2B = 874/5, C=297/5, E=431/10.\n\nSum: 84/5 + 874/5 + 297/5 + 431/10 = (84 + 874 + 297)/5 + 431/10 = (1255)/5 + 431/10 = 251 + 43.1 = 294.1. Same as before.\n\nColumn 2: 2A + 2E + C + D.\n\n2A = 84/5, 2E = 862/10 = 431/5, C=297/5, D=-48/5.\n\nSum: 84/5 + 431/5 + 297/5 -48/5 = (84 +431 +297 -48)/5 = (84+431=515; 515+297=812; 812-48=764)/5 = 764/5 = 152.8. Same.\n\nColumn 3: 3B + 2C + D.\n\nWait no, column 3 sum was 2B + C + A + E + D. Wait no, earlier calculation for column 3 was 2B + C + A + E + D. Let me recheck. Column 3 sum is 2B + C + A + E + D. Wait, no, earlier it was 2B + C + A + E + D? No, earlier calculation for column 3 was symbols B, B, C, A, E, D. Sum is B + B + C + A + E + D = 2B + C + A + E + D. Yes.\n\nWith fractions: 2B = 874/5, C=297/5, A=42/5, E=431/10, D=-48/5.\n\nConvert all to tenths:\n\n2B = 874/5 = 1748/10\n\nC = 297/5 = 594/10\n\nA = 42/5 = 84/10\n\nE = 431/10\n\nD = -48/5 = -96/10\n\nSum: 1748 + 594 + 84 + 431 - 96 all over 10.\n\nCalculate numerator: 1748 + 594 = 2342; +84 = 2426; +431 = 2857; -96 = 2761. 2761/10 = 276.1. Correct.\n\nSo all the column sums are indeed correct as decimals. Therefore, the answer should be the list of these decimal numbers. However, the problem's example shows integers, but perhaps in this case, the answer is allowed to have decimal points. The problem statement doesn't specify that the column sums must be integers.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is the list of column sums as calculated:\n\n[128.1, 294.1, 152.8, 276.1, 345.1, 230.1, 179.1, 371.4, 246.4]\n\nBut since the problem may expect the answer in a specific format, perhaps as integers rounded to the nearest whole number, but without explicit instructions, I'll provide the exact decimal values as computed.\n ;Answer: [128.1, 294.1, 152.8, 276.1, 345.1, 230.1, 179.1, 371.4, 246.4]"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the sum of each column in this grid based on the given row sums. Hmm. The grid has symbols like ?, ♦, ⊥, #, ∥, ∝, and maybe others. Each symbol represents a numerical value. The rows are given with their total sums. My job is to find the column sums and output them as a list.\n\nFirst, let me try to understand the structure. Each row is a sequence of symbols followed by a number which is the sum of that row. For example, the first row is \"∥?♦⊥#∥∝ -138\", so the sum of those symbols is -138. There are seven symbols in each row since the example answer has four elements but maybe the grid is 7 columns? Wait, the example given in the problem statement for the answer is [12,3,12,-15], which is four numbers. But looking at the grid here, each row seems to have seven symbols. Let me count:\n\nFirst row: ∥?♦⊥#∥∝ → that's 7 symbols. Then the sum is -138. So each row has seven symbols. Therefore, there are seven columns. But the example answer has four numbers. Hmm, maybe the example is just illustrative. The actual answer here should have seven numbers, one for each column.\n\nSo the grid has seven columns and seven rows (since there are seven rows given). Each column's sum is what I need to calculate.\n\nBut how do I find the value of each symbol? Well, since each row's sum is given, maybe I can set up equations for each row and solve for the symbols. However, there are multiple symbols and multiple equations. Let me see if I can find a way to determine each symbol's value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I don't need to find each symbol's value individually. Since the sum of all rows should equal the sum of all columns. Let me think. The total sum of all elements in the grid is the sum of each row's total. Then, the sum of the columns should add up to the same total. So if I can compute the total sum, and then find each column's sum by adding up the contributions from each row. But how?\n\nWait, but without knowing the individual symbol values, how can I compute the column sums? Unless there's a way to derive the column sums directly from the row sums and the symbols' positions. But that seems tricky. Maybe I need to assign variables to each symbol and solve the system of equations.\n\nLet me try that approach. Let's assign variables to each unique symbol. The symbols present are: ∥, ?, ♦, ⊥, #, ∝, and maybe others? Let me check all rows.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow 1: ∥?♦⊥#∥∝ → symbols are ∥, ?, ♦, ⊥, #, ∥, ∝. Wait, there's a repeated ∥ and ∝?\n\nRow 2: ♦⊥?∥#♦∥ → symbols: ♦, ⊥, ?, ∥, #, ♦, ∥.\n\nRow 3: #∝⊥∝♦## → #, ∝, ⊥, ∝, ♦, #, #.\n\nRow 4: ♦∝??∝⊥# → ♦, ∝, ?, ?, ∝, ⊥, #.\n\nRow 5: ∝⊥#⊥∥#? → ∝, ⊥, #, ⊥, ∥, #, ?.\n\nRow 6: ⊥#⊥∝??⊥ → ⊥, #, ⊥, ∝, ?, ?, ⊥.\n\nRow 7: ♦∝⊥⊥∝?♦ → ♦, ∝, ⊥, ⊥, ∝, ?, ♦.\n\nSo the unique symbols are: ∥, ?, ♦, ⊥, #, ∝, and maybe others? Let me check again. All rows seem to use these symbols. So there are six unique symbols? Let me count: ∥, ?, ♦, ⊥, #, ∝. That's six symbols. Each symbol has a unique value. Let me assign variables to each:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet’s assign:\n\nA = ∥\n\nB = ?\n\nC = ♦\n\nD = ⊥\n\nE = #\n\nF = ∝\n\nNow, each row can be written as an equation.\n\nLet me list each row's symbols and their sum:\n\nRow 1: A, B, C, D, E, A, F → sum is -138.\n\nSo equation 1: A + B + C + D + E + A + F = 2A + B + C + D + E + F = -138.\n\nRow 2: C, D, B, A, E, C, A → sum is -268.\n\nEquation 2: C + D + B + A + E + C + A = 2A + B + 2C + D + E = -268.\n\nRow 3: E, F, D, F, C, E, E → sum is 256.\n\nEquation 3: E + F + D + F + C + E + E = C + D + 3E + 2F = 256.\n\nRow 4: C, F, B, B, F, D, E → sum is 22.\n\nEquation 4: C + F + B + B + F + D + E = C + 2B + D + E + 2F = 22.\n\nRow 5: F, D, E, D, A, E, B → sum is -35.\n\nEquation 5: F + D + E + D + A + E + B = A + B + 2D + 2E + F = -35.\n\nRow 6: D, E, D, F, B, B, D → sum is -156.\n\nEquation 6: D + E + D + F + B + B + D = 3D + 2B + E + F = -156.\n\nRow 7: C, F, D, D, F, B, C → sum is -99.\n\nEquation 7: C + F + D + D + F + B + C = 2C + B + 2D + 2F = -99.\n\nNow, we have seven equations with six variables (A, B, C, D, E, F). Wait, but there are seven equations. That might be over-constrained. Let me check if there's a mistake in the equations.\n\nLet me re-express all equations:\n\nEquation 1: 2A + B + C + D + E + F = -138.\n\nEquation 2: 2A + B + 2C + D + E = -268.\n\nEquation 3: C + D + 3E + 2F = 256.\n\nEquation 4: C + 2B + D + E + 2F = 22.\n\nEquation 5: A + B + 2D + 2E + F = -35.\n\nEquation 6: 3D + 2B + E + F = -156.\n\nEquation 7: 2C + B + 2D + 2F = -99.\n\nSo seven equations with six variables. Let's see if we can solve this system.\n\nLet me try to find relations between the equations.\n\nFirst, let me note equations 1 and 2. Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate some variables.\n\nEquation 2 minus Equation 1:\n\n(2A + B + 2C + D + E) - (2A + B + C + D + E + F) = -268 - (-138)\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n2A - 2A + B - B + 2C - C + D - D + E - E - F = -130\n\nWhich becomes: C - F = -130 → C = F - 130. Let's call this equation 8.\n\nNow, equation 8: C = F - 130.\n\nNow, let's look at equation 7: 2C + B + 2D + 2F = -99. Let's substitute C from equation 8.\n\nEquation 7 becomes: 2*(F - 130) + B + 2D + 2F = -99 → 2F - 260 + B + 2D + 2F = -99 → 4F + B + 2D = 161. Let's call this equation 7a.\n\nNow, equation 6: 3D + 2B + E + F = -156. Let's note that.\n\nEquation 5: A + B + 2D + 2E + F = -35. Hmm.\n\nEquation 4: C + 2B + D + E + 2F = 22. Again, substitute C from equation 8: (F - 130) + 2B + D + E + 2F = 22 → 3F -130 + 2B + D + E = 22 → 2B + D + E + 3F = 152. Let's call this equation 4a.\n\nEquation 3: C + D + 3E + 2F = 256. Substitute C again: (F - 130) + D + 3E + 2F = 256 → 3F -130 + D + 3E = 256 → D + 3E + 3F = 386. Equation 3a.\n\nEquation 1: 2A + B + C + D + E + F = -138. Substitute C: 2A + B + (F - 130) + D + E + F = -138 → 2A + B + D + E + 2F = 8. Let's call this equation 1a.\n\nEquation 2: 2A + B + 2C + D + E = -268. Substitute C: 2A + B + 2*(F - 130) + D + E = -268 → 2A + B + D + E + 2F - 260 = -268 → 2A + B + D + E + 2F = -8. Let's call this equation 2a.\n\nWait, equation 1a is 2A + B + D + E + 2F = 8 and equation 2a is 2A + B + D + E + 2F = -8. That can't be possible unless 8 = -8, which is impossible. That suggests there's a contradiction here. Hmm, that's a problem. How did that happen?\n\nLet me check my equations again. Let me re-express equation 1 and 2 again.\n\nEquation 1: 2A + B + C + D + E + F = -138.\n\nEquation 2: 2A + B + 2C + D + E = -268.\n\nSo equation 2 minus equation 1 is:\n\n(2A + B + 2C + D + E) - (2A + B + C + D + E + F) = -268 - (-138)\n\nLeft side: 2C - C - F = C - F. Right side: -130.\n\nSo C - F = -130 → C = F - 130. That's correct.\n\nEquation 1a: After substitution, equation 1 becomes 2A + B + D + E + 2F = 8? Let me recheck:\n\nOriginal equation 1: 2A + B + C + D + E + F = -138. Substitute C = F - 130.\n\nSo 2A + B + (F - 130) + D + E + F = -138 → 2A + B + D + E + 2F -130 = -138 → 2A + B + D + E + 2F = -138 + 130 = -8. Wait, I must have made a mistake earlier. Earlier I said equation 1a is 8, but actually it's -8. Let me correct that.\n\nSo equation 1a: 2A + B + D + E + 2F = -8.\n\nEquation 2a was derived from equation 2 after substitution. Let me recheck equation 2a.\n\nEquation 2: 2A + B + 2C + D + E = -268. Substitute C = F - 130:\n\n2A + B + 2*(F - 130) + D + E = -268 → 2A + B + 2F - 260 + D + E = -268 → 2A + B + D + E + 2F = -268 + 260 = -8. So equation 2a is 2A + B + D + E + 2F = -8. Which is same as equation 1a. So no contradiction. My earlier mistake was miscalculating equation 1a. So equations 1a and 2a are the same. So that's okay. So that's one equation: 2A + B + D + E + 2F = -8. Let's note that.\n\nNow, moving on. Let's collect all equations again:\n\nEquation 1a and 2a are same: 2A + B + D + E + 2F = -8.\n\nEquation 3a: D + 3E + 3F = 386.\n\nEquation 4a: 2B + D + E + 3F = 152.\n\nEquation 5: A + B + 2D + 2E + F = -35.\n\nEquation 6: 3D + 2B + E + F = -156.\n\nEquation 7a: 4F + B + 2D = 161.\n\nSo now, we have equations 1a, 3a, 4a, 5, 6, 7a, and equation 8 (C = F - 130). Let's see how to proceed.\n\nLet me see if I can express variables in terms of others. Let's note that equation 1a involves A, but equations 3a, 4a, 5, 6, 7a don't involve A. So maybe we can solve for A later once others are found.\n\nLet me focus on equations 3a, 4a, 5, 6, 7a, and equation 1a.\n\nLet me see if I can find relations between these equations.\n\nEquation 7a: B + 2D + 4F = 161. Let's write that as equation 7a: B = 161 - 2D - 4F. Let's call this equation 7b.\n\nEquation 6: 3D + 2B + E + F = -156. Let's substitute B from equation 7b into equation 6.\n\nEquation 6 becomes: 3D + 2*(161 - 2D -4F) + E + F = -156 → 3D + 322 -4D -8F + E + F = -156 → (-D) + E -7F + 322 = -156 → -D + E -7F = -156 -322 = -478 → E = D + 7F - 478. Let's call this equation 6a.\n\nNow, equation 4a: 2B + D + E + 3F = 152. Substitute B from equation 7b and E from equation 6a.\n\nSo:\n\n2*(161 - 2D -4F) + D + (D +7F -478) +3F = 152.\n\nLet me compute this step by step:\n\nFirst term: 2*161 = 322; 2*(-2D) = -4D; 2*(-4F) = -8F. So 322 -4D -8F.\n\nAdding D: 322 -4D -8F + D = 322 -3D -8F.\n\nAdding (D +7F -478): 322 -3D -8F + D +7F -478 = 322 -478 -2D -F = (-156) -2D -F.\n\nAdding 3F: (-156 -2D -F) +3F = -156 -2D +2F.\n\nSet equal to 152:\n\n-156 -2D +2F = 152 → -2D +2F = 152 +156 = 308 → Divide by 2: -D + F = 154 → F = D + 154. Let's call this equation 9.\n\nSo equation 9: F = D + 154.\n\nNow, substitute equation 9 into equation 6a: E = D +7F -478. Let's replace F with D +154:\n\nE = D +7*(D +154) -478 → D +7D + 1078 -478 = 8D + 600. So E = 8D + 600. Equation 6b.\n\nNow, equation 3a: D + 3E + 3F = 386. Substitute E and F from equations 6b and 9:\n\nD + 3*(8D +600) +3*(D +154) = 386.\n\nCompute:\n\nD + 24D + 1800 + 3D + 462 = 386.\n\nCombine terms:\n\nD +24D +3D = 28D.\n\n1800 +462 = 2262.\n\nSo 28D + 2262 = 386 → 28D = 386 -2262 = -1876 → D = -1876 / 28.\n\nLet me compute that: 1876 divided by 28. Let me see, 28*67= 1876. Because 28*70=1960, subtract 28*3=84 → 1960-84=1876. So D = -67.\n\nSo D = -67.\n\nNow, from equation 9: F = D + 154 = -67 +154 = 87. So F = 87.\n\nFrom equation 7b: B = 161 -2D -4F. Substitute D=-67 and F=87:\n\nB = 161 -2*(-67) -4*(87) = 161 +134 -348 = (161+134)=295; 295 -348 = -53. So B = -53.\n\nFrom equation 6b: E = 8D +600 = 8*(-67) +600 = -536 +600 = 64. So E=64.\n\nNow, let's check equation 4a: 2B + D + E +3F = 152. Let's plug in the values:\n\n2*(-53) + (-67) +64 +3*(87) = -106 -67 +64 +261 = (-173) + 64 +261 = (-109) + 261 = 152. Correct. So that's good.\n\nNow, moving on. Now we have D=-67, F=87, B=-53, E=64.\n\nNow, let's find equation 1a: 2A + B + D + E + 2F = -8. Let's plug in the known values:\n\n2A + (-53) + (-67) +64 +2*(87) = -8.\n\nCalculate:\n\n-53 -67 = -120; -120 +64 = -56; 2*87=174. So total is 2A -56 +174 = 2A + 118 = -8 → 2A = -8 -118 = -126 → A = -63.\n\nSo A = -63.\n\nNow, from equation 8: C = F -130 = 87 -130 = -43. So C=-43.\n\nNow, check if these values satisfy equation 5: A + B + 2D + 2E + F = -35.\n\nA=-63, B=-53, D=-67, E=64, F=87.\n\nCompute:\n\n-63 + (-53) + 2*(-67) + 2*(64) +87.\n\nBreak it down:\n\n-63 -53 = -116.\n\n2*(-67) = -134 → -116 -134 = -250.\n\n2*64=128 → -250 +128 = -122.\n\nAdd 87: -122 +87 = -35. Correct. So equation 5 is satisfied.\n\nNow, check equation 3a: D +3E +3F = 386. D=-67, E=64, F=87.\n\n-67 +3*64 +3*87 = -67 +192 +261 = (-67) + 453 = 386. Correct.\n\nNow, check equation 7a: 4F + B + 2D = 161. F=87, B=-53, D=-67.\n\n4*87 = 348; B=-53; 2D= -134. Total: 348 -53 -134 = 348 -187 = 161. Correct.\n\nNow, check equation 6: 3D + 2B + E + F = -156. 3*(-67) + 2*(-53) +64 +87.\n\n3*(-67) = -201; 2*(-53) = -106. Total so far: -201 -106 = -307. Add 64 +87 = 151. -307 +151 = -156. Correct.\n\nSo all equations are satisfied. Now we have all variables:\n\nA = ∥ = -63\n\nB = ? = -53\n\nC = ♦ = -43\n\nD = ⊥ = -67\n\nE = # = 64\n\nF = ∝ = 87\n\nNow, with these values, we can compute the column sums. There are seven columns. For each column (from column 1 to column 7), we need to sum the values of each row's symbol in that column.\n\nLet me list each column's symbols across all rows.\n\nFirst, let me write down each row's symbols in order:\n\nRow 1: [A, B, C, D, E, A, F]\n\nRow 2: [C, D, B, A, E, C, A]\n\nRow 3: [E, F, D, F, C, E, E]\n\nRow 4: [C, F, B, B, F, D, E]\n\nRow 5: [F, D, E, D, A, E, B]\n\nRow 6: [D, E, D, F, B, B, D]\n\nRow 7: [C, F, D, D, F, B, C]\n\nNow, for each column (1 to 7), collect the symbols from each row and compute their sum.\n\nLet me process each column:\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow 1: A (-63)\n\nRow 2: C (-43)\n\nRow 3: E (64)\n\nRow 4: C (-43)\n\nRow 5: F (87)\n\nRow 6: D (-67)\n\nRow 7: C (-43)\n\nSum: (-63) + (-43) +64 + (-43) +87 + (-67) + (-43)\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nStart with 0.\n\nAdd -63: -63\n\nAdd -43: -106\n\nAdd 64: -42\n\nAdd -43: -85\n\nAdd 87: 2\n\nAdd -67: -65\n\nAdd -43: -108\n\nSo column 1 sum is -108.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow 1: B (-53)\n\nRow 2: D (-67)\n\nRow 3: F (87)\n\nRow 4: F (87)\n\nRow 5: D (-67)\n\nRow 6: E (64)\n\nRow 7: F (87)\n\nSum: (-53) + (-67) +87 +87 + (-67) +64 +87.\n\nLet me calculate:\n\nStart with 0.\n\n-53 -67 = -120\n\n+87 → -33\n\n+87 → 54\n\n-67 → -13\n\n+64 → 51\n\n+87 → 138.\n\nSo column 2 sum is 138.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow 1: C (-43)\n\nRow 2: B (-53)\n\nRow 3: D (-67)\n\nRow 4: B (-53)\n\nRow 5: E (64)\n\nRow 6: D (-67)\n\nRow 7: D (-67)\n\nSum: (-43) + (-53) + (-67) + (-53) +64 + (-67) + (-67)\n\nCompute step by step:\n\nStart with 0.\n\n-43 -53 = -96\n\n-96 -67 = -163\n\n-163 -53 = -216\n\n-216 +64 = -152\n\n-152 -67 = -219\n\n-219 -67 = -286.\n\nSo column 3 sum is -286.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nRow 1: D (-67)\n\nRow 2: A (-63)\n\nRow 3: F (87)\n\nRow 4: B (-53)\n\nRow 5: D (-67)\n\nRow 6: F (87)\n\nRow 7: D (-67)\n\nSum: (-67) + (-63) +87 + (-53) + (-67) +87 + (-67)\n\nCompute:\n\nStart with 0.\n\n-67 -63 = -130\n\n+87 → -43\n\n-53 → -96\n\n-67 → -163\n\n+87 → -76\n\n-67 → -143.\n\nSo column 4 sum is -143.\n\nColumn 5:\n\nRow 1: E (64)\n\nRow 2: E (64)\n\nRow 3: C (-43)\n\nRow 4: F (87)\n\nRow 5: A (-63)\n\nRow 6: B (-53)\n\nRow 7: F (87)\n\nSum: 64 +64 + (-43) +87 + (-63) + (-53) +87.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nStart with 0.\n\n64 +64 = 128\n\n-43 → 85\n\n+87 → 172\n\n-63 → 109\n\n-53 → 56\n\n+87 → 143.\n\nSo column 5 sum is 143.\n\nColumn 6:\n\nRow 1: A (-63)\n\nRow 2: C (-43)\n\nRow 3: E (64)\n\nRow 4: D (-67)\n\nRow 5: E (64)\n\nRow 6: B (-53)\n\nRow 7: B (-53)\n\nSum: (-63) + (-43) +64 + (-67) +64 + (-53) + (-53).\n\nCompute:\n\nStart with 0.\n\n-63 -43 = -106\n\n+64 → -42\n\n-67 → -109\n\n+64 → -45\n\n-53 → -98\n\n-53 → -151.\n\nSo column 6 sum is -151.\n\nColumn 7:\n\nRow 1: F (87)\n\nRow 2: A (-63)\n\nRow 3: E (64)\n\nRow 4: E (64)\n\nRow 5: B (-53)\n\nRow 6: D (-67)\n\nRow 7: C (-43)\n\nSum: 87 + (-63) +64 +64 + (-53) + (-67) + (-43).\n\nCompute:\n\nStart with 0.\n\n87 -63 = 24\n\n+64 → 88\n\n+64 → 152\n\n-53 → 99\n\n-67 → 32\n\n-43 → -11.\n\nSo column 7 sum is -11.\n\nNow, compiling all column sums:\n\nColumn 1: -108\n\nColumn 2: 138\n\nColumn 3: -286\n\nColumn 4: -143\n\nColumn 5: 143\n\nColumn 6: -151\n\nColumn 7: -11\n\nSo the final answer is the list of these sums in order: [-108, 138, -286, -143, 143, -151, -11].\n\nLet me double-check the calculations for each column to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nColumn 1: -63 -43 +64 -43 +87 -67 -43.\n\nLet me re-calculate:\n\n-63 -43 = -106; +64 → -42; -43 → -85; +87 → +2; -67 → -65; -43 → -108.

      "Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have a grid with symbols in each row, and each symbol represents a numerical value. The sum of each row is given. Our task is to compute the sum of each column and output those sums as a list.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each symbol stands for. The symbols here are ∉, ∑, ≥, ⊥, and ≥ again. Wait, maybe there are more? Let me check the grid again.\n\nLooking at the grid rows:\n\nRow 1: ∉ ∑ ≥ ∑ ≥ → sum 197\nRow 2: ∉ ≥ ⊥ ≥ ∉ → sum 120\nRow 3: ∉ ∉ ∉ ∉ ≥ → sum 160\nRow 4: ∉ ∑ ∉ ≥ ≥ → sum 196\nRow 5: ⊥ ≥ ∑ ∉ ∑ → sum 87\nRow 6: ≥ ≥ ≥ ≥ ⊥ → sum 190\n\nSo the symbols used are ∉, ∑, ≥, ⊥. Wait, there's also the symbol ≥ appearing multiple times. Maybe each symbol corresponds to a unique value, but I need to figure out what each one is.\n\nSince there are 5 columns, each row has 5 symbols. Let me denote each symbol with variables. Let me assign:\n\nLet’s assign variables to each symbol:\n\nLet’s say:\n\nA = ∉\nB = ∑\nC = ≥\nD = ⊥\n\nSo, each symbol is a variable representing a number. Now, we can write equations based on the row sums.\n\nLet me list each row as equations:\n\nRow 1: A + B + C + B + C = 197 → A + 2B + 2C = 197\n\nRow 2: A + C + D + C + A = 120 → 2A + 2C + D = 120\n\nRow 3: A + A + A + A + C = 160 → 4A + C = 160\n\nRow 4: A + B + A + C + C = 196 → 2A + B + 2C = 196\n\nRow 5: D + C + B + A + B = 87 → D + C + 2B + A = 87\n\nRow 6: C + C + C + C + D = 190 → 4C + D = 190\n\nSo now we have a system of equations. Let me write them again:\n\n1. A + 2B + 2C = 197\n2. 2A + 2C + D = 120\n3. 4A + C = 160\n4. 2A + B + 2C = 196\n5. A + 2B + C + D = 87\n6. 4C + D = 190\n\nOur variables are A, B, C, D. Let's see if we can solve this system.\n\nStarting with equation 3: 4A + C = 160 → C = 160 - 4A. Let's note this.\n\nEquation 6: 4C + D = 190 → D = 190 - 4C. Since C is expressed in terms of A, we can substitute that in.\n\nLet me substitute C from equation 3 into equation 6.\n\nD = 190 -4*(160 -4A) = 190 - 640 + 16A = -450 +16A.\n\nSo D = 16A -450.\n\nNow, let's look at equation 2: 2A + 2C + D = 120. Substitute C and D:\n\n2A + 2*(160 -4A) + (16A -450) = 120.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n2A + 320 -8A +16A -450 = 120.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(2A -8A +16A) + (320 -450) = 120.\n\n(10A) -130 = 120 → 10A = 250 → A = 25.\n\nSo A is 25. Now let's find C from equation 3:\n\nC = 160 -4A = 160 -4*25 = 160 -100 = 60. So C = 60.\n\nThen D = 16A -450 = 16*25 -450 = 400 -450 = -50. So D = -50.\n\nNow let's find B. Let's use equation 1: A + 2B + 2C = 197. Substituting A=25, C=60:\n\n25 + 2B + 2*60 = 197 → 25 + 2B + 120 = 197 → 145 + 2B = 197 → 2B = 52 → B=26.\n\nLet me check equation 4: 2A + B + 2C = 196. Substituting A=25, B=26, C=60:\n\n2*25 +26 +2*60 = 50 +26 +120 = 196. That works.\n\nNow check equation 5: A + 2B + C + D = 87. Let's plug in:\n\nA=25, B=26, C=60, D=-50.\n\n25 + 2*26 +60 + (-50) = 25 +52 +60 -50 = 25+52=77; 77+60=137; 137-50=87. Correct.\n\nSo all equations are satisfied. So the values are:\n\nA (∉) = 25\n\nB (∑) = 26\n\nC (≥) = 60\n\nD (⊥) = -50\n\nNow, we need to compute the column sums. The grid has 5 columns. Let me list each column's symbols and compute their values.\n\nFirst, let me reconstruct the grid with the symbols and their positions:\n\nColumns 1 to 5:\n\nRow 1: [∉, ∑, ≥, ∑, ≥] → [A, B, C, B, C]\n\nRow 2: [∉, ≥, ⊥, ≥, ∉] → [A, C, D, C, A]\n\nRow 3: [∉, ∉, ∉, ∉, ≥] → [A, A, A, A, C]\n\nRow 4: [∉, ∑, ∉, ≥, ≥] → [A, B, A, C, C]\n\nRow 5: [⊥, ≥, ∑, ∉, ∑] → [D, C, B, A, B]\n\nRow 6: [≥, ≥, ≥, ≥, ⊥] → [C, C, C, C, D]\n\nNow, for each column (1 to 5), sum the values in that column across all 6 rows.\n\nLet me process each column one by one.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow1: A (25)\n\nRow2: A (25)\n\nRow3: A (25)\n\nRow4: A (25)\n\nRow5: D (-50)\n\nRow6: C (60)\n\nSum: 25 +25 +25 +25 + (-50) +60 = Let's compute step by step:\n\n25*4 = 100. Then 100 -50 = 50. 50 +60=110. So column 1 sum is 110.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow1: B (26)\n\nRow2: C (60)\n\nRow3: A (25)\n\nRow4: B (26)\n\nRow5: C (60)\n\nRow6: C (60)\n\nSum: 26 +60 +25 +26 +60 +60 = Let's add:\n\n26+60=86; 86+25=111; 111+26=137; 137+60=197; 197+60=257. Column 2 sum is 257.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow1: C (60)\n\nRow2: D (-50)\n\nRow3: A (25)\n\nRow4: A (25)\n\nRow5: B (26)\n\nRow6: C (60)\n\nSum: 60 + (-50) +25 +25 +26 +60 = Let's compute:\n\n60-50=10; 10+25=35; 35+25=60; 60+26=86; 86+60=146. Column 3 sum is 146.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nRow1: B (26)\n\nRow2: C (60)\n\nRow3: A (25)\n\nRow4: C (60)\n\nRow5: A (25)\n\nRow6: C (60)\n\nSum: 26 +60 +25 +60 +25 +60 = Let's add:\n\n26+60=86; 86+25=111; 111+60=171; 171+25=196; 196+60=256. Column 4 sum is 256.\n\nColumn 5:\n\nRow1: C (60)\n\nRow2: A (25)\n\nRow3: C (60)\n\nRow4: C (60)\n\nRow5: B (26)\n\nRow6: D (-50)\n\nSum: 60 +25 +60 +60 +26 +(-50) = Let's compute:\n\n60+25=85; 85+60=145; 145+60=205; 205+26=231; 231-50=181.

      "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the column sums based on the given grid and row sums. The grid has symbols in each cell, and each symbol represents a numerical value. The rows are given with their total sums. My task is to compute the column sums and output them as a list.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure. The grid has 8 rows and, looking at the first line: ∉⇒♥∂#$$♥∂ -100. Let me count the symbols. Let's see: ∉, ⇒, ♥, ∂, #, $, $, ♥, ∂. That's 9 symbols. So each row has 9 symbols, meaning there are 9 columns. Therefore, the grid is 8 rows by 9 columns. Each row's sum is provided, and I need to find the sum for each of the 9 columns.\n\nBut how do I find the value of each symbol? Wait, maybe each symbol has a unique value, but there are multiple symbols. Let me check how many unique symbols there are. Let's list them all:\n\nLooking at the grid:\n\nFirst row: ∉, ⇒, ♥, ∂, #, $, $, ♥, ∂\nSecond row: →, →, $, $, ∂, $, ⇒, ∂, ♥\nThird row: #, ∂, ♥, ♥, ♥, ⇒, ⇒, ∂, ♥\nFourth row: #, →, ∉, →, ∂, #, ⇒, ∂, ⇒\nFifth row: $, ∉, →, ♥, $, ♥, →, $, ∉\nSixth row: →, ∂, #, ♥, $, ∉, ∉, #, ⇒\nSeventh row: ∂, ∉, ♥, ♥, ∂, #, ♥, →, ♥\nEighth row: #, ∉, →, ♥, ♥, #, $, ♥, ⇒\n\nSo the symbols are: ∉, ⇒, ♥, ∂, #, $, →, and maybe others? Let me count all unique symbols. Let's see:\n\n∉, ⇒, ♥, ∂, #, $, →. Are there any others? Let me check each row again. The symbols listed are:\n\n- ∉, ⇒, ♥, ∂, #, $, →. That's seven different symbols. Let me confirm each row:\n\nFirst row: yes, those seven. Second row: →, $, ∂, ⇒, #. Third row: same symbols. Fourth row: same. Fifth row: same. Sixth row: same. Seventh: same. Eighth: same. So total seven unique symbols. Each symbol has a value. Let me denote them as variables.\n\nLet me assign variables to each symbol:\n\nLet me define:\n\nA = ∉\nB = ⇒\nC = ♥\nD = ∂\nE = #\nF = $\nG = →\n\nSo each symbol corresponds to a variable. Now, each row's sum is given. Each row can be converted into an equation based on the symbols in that row.\n\nFor example, the first row is:\n\n∉ (A), ⇒ (B), ♥ (C), ∂ (D), # (E), $ (F), $ (F), ♥ (C), ∂ (D). The sum is -100.\n\nSo equation 1: A + B + C + D + E + F + F + C + D = -100. Which simplifies to A + B + 2C + 2D + E + 2F = -100.\n\nSimilarly, the second row is → (G), → (G), $ (F), $ (F), ∂ (D), $ (F), ⇒ (B), ∂ (D), ♥ (C). Sum is -168. So equation 2: 2G + 2F + D + F + B + D + C = 2G + 3F + 2D + B + C = -168.\n\nWait, let me recheck the order. The symbols in the second row are →, →, $, $, ∂, $, ⇒, ∂, ♥. So the equation is G + G + F + F + D + F + B + D + C. That's 2G + 3F + 2D + B + C = -168.\n\nSimilarly, I need to create equations for each of the 8 rows. Then, I can solve this system of equations to find the values of A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Once I have those values, I can compute each column's sum by adding up the corresponding symbols' values across each column.\n\nBut solving seven variables with eight equations? Wait, there are seven variables and eight equations. That might be overdetermined, but maybe the equations are consistent.\n\nSo let's proceed step by step. Let me write down each equation for each row.\n\nRow 1: A + B + 2C + 2D + E + 2F = -100. (Equation 1)\n\nRow 2: 2G + 3F + 2D + B + C = -168. (Equation 2)\n\nRow 3: #, ∂, ♥, ♥, ♥, ⇒, ⇒, ∂, ♥. So symbols: E, D, C, C, C, B, B, D, C. Sum is 74.\n\nEquation 3: E + D + 3C + 2B + D + C = E + 2D + 4C + 2B = 74? Wait, let me recount:\n\nThe row is: # (E), ∂ (D), ♥ (C), ♥ (C), ♥ (C), ⇒ (B), ⇒ (B), ∂ (D), ♥ (C). So symbols:\n\nE, D, C, C, C, B, B, D, C. So that's E + D + 3C + 2B + D + C? Wait:\n\nE (once), D (twice?), because the row is E, D, C, C, C, B, B, D, C. So D appears in positions 2 and 8? So D occurs twice. C occurs in positions 3,4,5,9: four times? Wait, positions 3,4,5, and 9. So 4 Cs? Let me count:\n\nOriginal symbols for row 3: E, D, C, C, C, B, B, D, C. So that's:\n\nE (1), D (2), C (positions 3,4,5,9) → 4 Cs, B (positions 6,7) → 2 Bs. So equation 3: E + 2D + 4C + 2B = 74. (Equation 3)\n\nRow 4: #, →, ∉, →, ∂, #, ⇒, ∂, ⇒. Symbols: E, G, A, G, D, E, B, D, B. Sum is 139.\n\nSo E + G + A + G + D + E + B + D + B = A + 2G + 2E + 2D + 2B = 139. (Equation 4)\n\nRow 5: $, ∉, →, ♥, $, ♥, →, $, ∉. Symbols: F, A, G, C, F, C, G, F, A. Sum is 70.\n\nSo F + A + G + C + F + C + G + F + A = 2A + 2G + 2C + 3F = 70. (Equation 5)\n\nRow 6: →, ∂, #, ♥, $, ∉, ∉, #, ⇒. Symbols: G, D, E, C, F, A, A, E, B. Sum is 130.\n\nEquation: G + D + E + C + F + 2A + E + B = 2A + G + D + 2E + C + F + B = 130. (Equation 6)\n\nRow 7: ∂, ∉, ♥, ♥, ∂, #, ♥, →, ♥. Symbols: D, A, C, C, D, E, C, G, C. Sum is 150.\n\nEquation: D + A + 2C + D + E + C + G + C = A + 2D + E + 4C + G = 150. (Equation 7)\n\nRow 8: #, ∉, →, ♥, ♥, #, $, ♥, ⇒. Symbols: E, A, G, C, C, E, F, C, B. Sum is 184.\n\nEquation: E + A + G + 2C + E + F + C + B = A + G + 2E + 3C + F + B = 184. (Equation 8)\n\nSo now I have 8 equations with 7 variables (A, B, C, D, E, F, G). Let me list all equations again:\n\nEquation 1: A + B + 2C + 2D + E + 2F = -100\n\nEquation 2: 2G + 3F + 2D + B + C = -168\n\nEquation 3: E + 2D + 4C + 2B = 74\n\nEquation 4: A + 2G + 2E + 2D + 2B = 139\n\nEquation 5: 2A + 2G + 2C + 3F = 70\n\nEquation 6: 2A + G + D + 2E + C + F + B = 130\n\nEquation 7: A + 2D + E + 4C + G = 150\n\nEquation 8: A + G + 2E + 3C + F + B = 184\n\nThis seems complex, but maybe we can solve this step by step. Let me see if I can find substitutions or combinations.\n\nFirst, let's note that there are 8 equations and 7 variables. So perhaps one equation is redundant, but maybe not. Let's proceed.\n\nLet me try to express variables in terms of others.\n\nStarting with Equation 3: E + 2D + 4C + 2B = 74. Let's note this as Equation 3.\n\nEquation 2: 2G + 3F + 2D + B + C = -168. Equation 2.\n\nEquation 5: 2A + 2G + 2C + 3F = 70. Equation 5.\n\nEquation 4: A + 2G + 2E + 2D + 2B = 139. Equation 4.\n\nEquation 7: A + 2D + E + 4C + G = 150. Equation 7.\n\nEquation 8: A + G + 2E + 3C + F + B = 184. Equation 8.\n\nEquation 6: 2A + G + D + 2E + C + F + B = 130. Equation 6.\n\nEquation 1: A + B + 2C + 2D + E + 2F = -100. Equation 1.\n\nThis is a lot. Let me see if I can find equations that can be combined.\n\nLet me look for equations that can be solved for one variable. For example, maybe Equation 3 can be used to express E in terms of others. Let's try:\n\nEquation 3: E = 74 - 2D - 4C - 2B. (Equation 3a)\n\nSimilarly, Equation 2: Let's rearrange for 2G?\n\nEquation 2: 2G = -168 - 3F - 2D - B - C. (Equation 2a)\n\nEquation 5: 2A = 70 - 2G - 2C - 3F. (Equation 5a)\n\nEquation 4: A = 139 - 2G - 2E - 2D - 2B. (Equation 4a)\n\nEquation 7: A = 150 - 2D - E - 4C - G. (Equation 7a)\n\nEquation 8: Let's rearrange for A: A = 184 - G - 2E - 3C - F - B. (Equation 8a)\n\nEquation 6: 2A = 130 - G - D - 2E - C - F - B. (Equation 6a)\n\nEquation 1: A = -100 - B - 2C - 2D - E - 2F. (Equation 1a)\n\nNow, since we have multiple expressions for A, perhaps we can equate them.\n\nFor example, from Equation 4a and Equation 7a:\n\nEquation 4a: A = 139 - 2G - 2E - 2D - 2B.\n\nEquation 7a: A = 150 - 2D - E - 4C - G.\n\nSet equal:\n\n139 - 2G - 2E - 2D - 2B = 150 - 2D - E - 4C - G.\n\nSimplify:\n\nLeft side: 139 - 2G - 2E - 2D - 2B\n\nRight side: 150 - 2D - E - 4C - G\n\nSubtract right side from left side:\n\n(139 - 150) + (-2G + G) + (-2E + E) + (-2D + 2D) + (-2B) + 4C = 0\n\n-11 - G - E - 2B + 4C = 0 → -G - E - 2B + 4C = 11 → G + E + 2B - 4C = -11. Let's call this Equation 9.\n\nHmm. Not sure yet. Let's see if we can use Equation 3a (E in terms of others) here.\n\nEquation 3a: E = 74 - 2D -4C -2B. Substitute into Equation 9:\n\nG + [74 - 2D -4C -2B] + 2B -4C = -11.\n\nSimplify:\n\nG + 74 -2D -4C -2B + 2B -4C = -11 → G +74 -2D -8C = -11 → G -2D -8C = -85 → G = 2D +8C -85. (Equation 9a)\n\nNow, Equation 9a gives G in terms of D and C.\n\nLet me also look at Equation 2a: 2G = -168 -3F -2D -B -C → G = (-168 -3F -2D -B -C)/2. But perhaps later.\n\nLet me see if I can use Equation 7a and Equation 4a. Also, Equation 7a and Equation 1a?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use Equation 7a and Equation 8a. Let's see.\n\nEquation 7a: A = 150 -2D -E -4C -G.\n\nEquation 8a: A = 184 -G -2E -3C -F -B.\n\nSet equal:\n\n150 -2D -E -4C -G = 184 -G -2E -3C -F -B.\n\nSimplify:\n\nLeft side: 150 -2D -E -4C -G\n\nRight side: 184 -G -2E -3C -F -B\n\nSubtract left side from right side:\n\n(184 -150) + (-G + G) + (-2E + E) + (-3C +4C) + F + B - (-2D) ?\n\nWait, perhaps better to rearrange terms:\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n150 -2D -E -4C -G -184 + G + 2E +3C + F + B = 0 → \n\n(150 -184) + (-2D) + (-E +2E) + (-4C +3C) + (-G +G) + F + B = 0 → \n\n-34 -2D + E - C + F + B = 0 → \n\nE + B + F -2D -C = 34. (Equation 10)\n\nNow, from Equation 3a: E = 74 -2D -4C -2B. Substitute into Equation 10:\n\n(74 -2D -4C -2B) + B + F -2D -C = 34 → \n\n74 -2D -4C -2B + B + F -2D -C = 34 → \n\n74 -4D -5C -B + F = 34 → \n\n-4D -5C -B + F = 34 -74 → \n\n-4D -5C -B + F = -40 → \n\nF = 4D +5C +B -40. (Equation 10a)\n\nNow, Equation 10a gives F in terms of D, C, B.\n\nLet me also look at Equation 2a: 2G +3F +2D +B +C = -168. If I can substitute G from Equation 9a and F from Equation 10a into Equation 2, perhaps.\n\nEquation 9a: G = 2D +8C -85.\n\nEquation 10a: F = 4D +5C +B -40.\n\nSubstitute into Equation 2:\n\n2*(2D +8C -85) + 3*(4D +5C +B -40) + 2D + B + C = -168.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n2*(2D +8C -85) = 4D +16C -170.\n\n3*(4D +5C +B -40) = 12D +15C +3B -120.\n\nAdding 2D + B + C.\n\nTotal equation:\n\n[4D +16C -170] + [12D +15C +3B -120] + 2D + B + C = -168.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nD terms: 4D +12D +2D = 18D.\n\nC terms: 16C +15C + C = 32C.\n\nB terms: 3B + B = 4B.\n\nConstants: -170 -120 = -290.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n18D +32C +4B -290 = -168 → \n\n18D +32C +4B = -168 +290 → \n\n18D +32C +4B = 122. \n\nDivide both sides by 2: 9D +16C +2B = 61. Let's call this Equation 11.\n\nNow, let's see if we can find another equation involving D, C, B.\n\nLooking at Equation 3a: E = 74 -2D -4C -2B. Maybe use this with another equation.\n\nLet me check Equation 6a: 2A = 130 - G - D -2E -C -F -B.\n\nBut Equation 6a is from Equation 6. Let me see if I can substitute variables here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use Equation 1a: A = -100 - B -2C -2D -E -2F.\n\nBut since E is expressed in terms of D, C, B (Equation 3a), and F is expressed in terms of D, C, B (Equation 10a), maybe substitute those into Equation 1a to express A in terms of D, C, B.\n\nLet me try:\n\nEquation 1a: A = -100 - B -2C -2D -E -2F.\n\nSubstitute E from Equation 3a and F from Equation 10a:\n\nA = -100 - B -2C -2D - [74 -2D -4C -2B] -2*[4D +5C +B -40].\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\nFirst, expand the terms:\n\n- [74 -2D -4C -2B] = -74 +2D +4C +2B.\n\n-2*[4D +5C +B -40] = -8D -10C -2B +80.\n\nSo putting all together:\n\nA = -100 - B -2C -2D -74 +2D +4C +2B -8D -10C -2B +80.\n\nNow combine like terms:\n\nConstants: -100 -74 +80 = -94.\n\nB terms: -B +2B -2B = (-1 +2 -2)B = -1B.\n\nC terms: -2C +4C -10C = (-2 +4 -10)C = -8C.\n\nD terms: -2D +2D -8D = (-2 +2 -8)D = -8D.\n\nSo overall:\n\nA = -94 - B -8C -8D.\n\nSo Equation 12: A = -94 - B -8C -8D.\n\nNow, let's look at Equation 7a: A = 150 -2D -E -4C -G.\n\nBut we can substitute E from Equation 3a and G from Equation 9a.\n\nE = 74 -2D -4C -2B.\n\nG = 2D +8C -85.\n\nSo:\n\nA = 150 -2D - [74 -2D -4C -2B] -4C - [2D +8C -85].\n\nLet me expand:\n\n= 150 -2D -74 +2D +4C +2B -4C -2D -8C +85.\n\nCombine terms:\n\nConstants: 150 -74 +85 = 150 +11 = 161.\n\nD terms: -2D +2D -2D = -2D.\n\nC terms: +4C -4C -8C = -8C.\n\nB terms: +2B.\n\nSo:\n\nA = 161 -2D -8C +2B.\n\nBut from Equation 12, A is also equal to -94 -B -8C -8D. So set them equal:\n\n-94 - B -8C -8D = 161 -2D -8C +2B.\n\nSimplify:\n\nLeft side: -94 - B -8C -8D.\n\nRight side: 161 -2D -8C +2B.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-94 - B -8C -8D -161 +2D +8C -2B = 0 → \n\n(-94 -161) + (-B -2B) + (-8C +8C) + (-8D +2D) = 0 → \n\n-255 -3B -6D = 0 → \n\n-3B -6D = 255 → \n\nDivide both sides by -3: B + 2D = -85. \n\nSo Equation 13: B = -85 -2D.\n\nNow, this is a useful relation. Let me note that B is expressed in terms of D.\n\nNow, let's substitute B = -85 -2D into Equation 11: 9D +16C +2B = 61.\n\nSubstitute B:\n\n9D +16C +2*(-85 -2D) = 61 → \n\n9D +16C -170 -4D = 61 → \n\n5D +16C = 61 +170 → \n\n5D +16C = 231. Equation 14.\n\nNow, Equation 14: 5D +16C = 231.\n\nAlso, from Equation 13: B = -85 -2D.\n\nNow, let's look for another equation involving D and C. Let's check Equation 10a: F = 4D +5C +B -40. Since B is known in terms of D, substitute:\n\nF = 4D +5C + (-85 -2D) -40 → \n\nF = 4D -2D +5C -85 -40 → \n\nF = 2D +5C -125. Equation 10b.\n\nNow, let's also look at Equation 9a: G = 2D +8C -85.\n\nNow, let's see if we can find another equation involving D and C. Let's check Equation 3a and others.\n\nEquation 3a: E = 74 -2D -4C -2B. Since B = -85 -2D, substitute:\n\nE = 74 -2D -4C -2*(-85 -2D) → \n\nE = 74 -2D -4C +170 +4D → \n\nE = (74 +170) + ( -2D +4D ) -4C → \n\nE = 244 +2D -4C. Equation 3b.\n\nNow, let's check Equation 4a: A = 139 - 2G - 2E - 2D - 2B.\n\nWe can substitute G from Equation 9a, E from Equation 3b, and B from Equation 13.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst, compute G = 2D +8C -85.\n\nThen 2G = 2*(2D +8C -85) = 4D +16C -170.\n\nNext, E = 244 +2D -4C. So 2E = 488 +4D -8C.\n\nThen 2D remains as is.\n\n2B = 2*(-85 -2D) = -170 -4D.\n\nPutting into Equation 4a:\n\nA = 139 - [4D +16C -170] - [488 +4D -8C] -2D - [ -170 -4D ].\n\nWait, let me parse Equation 4a again: A = 139 - 2G - 2E - 2D - 2B.\n\nSo:\n\nA = 139 - 2G -2E -2D -2B.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n= 139 - (4D +16C -170) - (488 +4D -8C) -2D - (-170 -4D).\n\nLet me compute each part step by step:\n\nFirst, expand the terms:\n\n- (4D +16C -170) = -4D -16C +170.\n\n- (488 +4D -8C) = -488 -4D +8C.\n\n-2D is just -2D.\n\n- (-170 -4D) = +170 +4D.\n\nSo putting all together:\n\nA = 139 + (-4D -16C +170) + (-488 -4D +8C) -2D +170 +4D.\n\nNow combine terms:\n\nConstants: 139 +170 -488 +170 = 139 + (170 +170) -488 = 139 + 340 -488 = 479 -488 = -9.\n\nD terms: -4D -4D -2D +4D = (-4 -4 -2 +4)D = (-6D).\n\nC terms: -16C +8C = -8C.\n\nSo overall:\n\nA = -9 -6D -8C.\n\nBut from Equation 12, we had A = -94 -B -8C -8D. Let's check if this is consistent.\n\nEquation 12: A = -94 -B -8C -8D. Since B = -85 -2D, substituting:\n\nA = -94 - (-85 -2D) -8C -8D = -94 +85 +2D -8C -8D = (-9) -6D -8C. Which matches the result from Equation 4a. So that's consistent. Good.\n\nNow, we need another equation to relate D and C. Let's look at Equation 5: 2A + 2G + 2C + 3F = 70.\n\nWe can express A, G, F in terms of D and C.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nA = -9 -6D -8C.\n\nG = 2D +8C -85.\n\nF = 2D +5C -125. (Equation 10b)\n\nSo substitute into Equation 5:\n\n2*(-9 -6D -8C) + 2*(2D +8C -85) + 2C + 3*(2D +5C -125) = 70.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n2*(-9 -6D -8C) = -18 -12D -16C.\n\n2*(2D +8C -85) = 4D +16C -170.\n\n2C is just 2C.\n\n3*(2D +5C -125) = 6D +15C -375.\n\nAdding all together:\n\n(-18 -12D -16C) + (4D +16C -170) + 2C + (6D +15C -375) = 70.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nConstants: -18 -170 -375 = -563.\n\nD terms: -12D +4D +6D = (-12 +4 +6)D = -2D.\n\nC terms: -16C +16C +2C +15C = (0 +2 +15)C = 17C.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n-563 -2D +17C = 70 → \n\n-2D +17C = 70 +563 → \n\n-2D +17C = 633. Equation 15.\n\nNow, we have Equation 14: 5D +16C = 231.\n\nAnd Equation 15: -2D +17C = 633.\n\nNow, we can solve these two equations for D and C.\n\nLet me write them:\n\nEquation 14: 5D +16C = 231.\n\nEquation 15: -2D +17C = 633.\n\nLet me use the elimination method. Let's multiply Equation 14 by 2 and Equation 15 by 5 to eliminate D:\n\nEquation 14 * 2: 10D +32C = 462.\n\nEquation 15 * 5: -10D +85C = 3165.\n\nNow add them together:\n\n(10D -10D) + (32C +85C) = 462 +3165 → \n\n117C = 3627 → \n\nC = 3627 / 117.\n\nLet me compute this division. Let's see:\n\nDivide 3627 by 117:\n\n117 × 31 = 117 × 30 + 117 = 3510 + 117 = 3627. Exactly. So C = 31.\n\nSo C = 31.\n\nNow, substitute C = 31 into Equation 14: 5D +16*31 = 231 → \n\n5D + 496 = 231 → \n\n5D = 231 -496 = -265 → \n\nD = -265 /5 = -53.\n\nSo D = -53.\n\nNow that we have C and D, we can find other variables.\n\nFrom Equation 13: B = -85 -2D → B = -85 -2*(-53) = -85 +106 = 21. So B = 21.\n\nNow, from Equation 3b: E = 244 +2D -4C → E = 244 +2*(-53) -4*(31) = 244 -106 -124 = 244 - 230 = 14. So E = 14.\n\nFrom Equation 10b: F = 2D +5C -125 → F = 2*(-53) +5*(31) -125 = -106 +155 -125 = (-106 -125) +155 = -231 +155 = -76. So F = -76.\n\nFrom Equation 9a: G = 2D +8C -85 → G = 2*(-53) +8*(31) -85 = -106 +248 -85 = (248 -106) -85 = 142 -85 = 57. So G = 57.\n\nFrom Equation 12: A = -94 - B -8C -8D. Let's compute:\n\nA = -94 -21 -8*(31) -8*(-53) = -94 -21 -248 +424 = (-94 -21 -248) +424 = (-363) +424 = 61. So A = 61.\n\nLet me verify these values with some equations to check for consistency.\n\nCheck Equation 1: A + B + 2C + 2D + E + 2F = -100.\n\nA=61, B=21, C=31, D=-53, E=14, F=-76.\n\nCompute:\n\n61 +21 + 2*31 + 2*(-53) +14 + 2*(-76) \n\n= 61 +21 +62 -106 +14 -152 \n\n= (61+21) =82; 82+62=144; 144-106=38; 38+14=52; 52-152= -100.

      "Okay, let's see. I need to find the sum of each column in this grid based on the given row sums. Hmm. The grid has symbols like ≤, ♠, ∅, ♦, ↑, ∝, and each row's total is provided. The challenge is to figure out each column's sum by understanding the relationships between the symbols and their values.\n\nFirst, I should note that each row's sum is given, and each symbol represents a numerical value. Since there are multiple rows and columns, maybe I can set up equations based on the symbols in each row and their total. But with multiple symbols, that could get complicated. Wait, but maybe there's a pattern or a way to determine the value of each symbol?\n\nLet me count the number of rows and columns. The grid has 9 rows. Each row has 7 symbols (since each line has symbols separated by spaces and then the sum). Let me check: the first line is \"≤♠∅♦≤♦∝ 35\" – that's seven symbols before the sum. So there are 7 columns. Each row has 7 symbols, and each column will have 9 entries (since there are 9 rows). The task is to compute the sum for each of the 7 columns.\n\nBut how to find each column's sum? Since each row's sum is known, perhaps the total of all row sums equals the total of all column sums. Let me verify that. The sum of all elements in the grid can be calculated by adding up all the row sums. Then, since columns are just another way to sum the same elements, the sum of the column sums should equal the total from the rows. However, that alone doesn't give individual column sums. But maybe there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, if I can determine the value of each symbol, then I can compute each column's sum by adding up the values of the symbols in that column. But how to find the value of each symbol? Let's see. Let's assign variables to each symbol. Let me list all the symbols present:\n\nSymbols: ≤, ♠, ∅, ♦, ↑, ∝. Wait, maybe there are more? Let me check each row again.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: ≤, ♠, ∅, ♦, ≤, ♦, ∝ → sum 35\nRow 2: ♠, ∝, ≤, ♠, ↑, ≤, ♦ → sum -206\nRow 3: ∅, ≤, ♦, ≤, ♠, ≤, ∝ → sum 91\nRow 4: ∝, ♦, ≤, ≤, ♠, ♠, ≤ → sum -100\nRow 5: ≤, ≤, ≤, ∅, ∅, ≤, ∝ → sum 338\nRow 6: ↑, ↑, ≤, ≤, ↑, ≤, ♦ → sum -241\nRow 7: ∅, ♠, ∅, ♦, ≤, ≤, ∅ → sum 202\nRow 8: ♠, ∅, ∅, ∝, ∝, ♠, ∝ → sum 208\nRow 9: ↑, ↑, ∅, ♠, ∅, ∅, ∅ → sum 125\n\nSo symbols are: ≤, ♠, ∅, ♦, ↑, ∝. Let me count how many unique symbols there are. That's six symbols. Each row is a combination of these symbols, and their sum is given. So if I can create equations for each row, I can solve for the symbols' values.\n\nLet me assign variables:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet a = ≤\n\nb = ♠\n\nc = ∅\n\nd = ♦\n\ne = ↑\n\nf = ∝\n\nNow, each row can be written as an equation.\n\nRow 1: a + b + c + d + a + d + f = 35 → 2a + b + c + 2d + f = 35 ... (1)\n\nRow 2: b + f + a + b + e + a + d = -206 → 2a + 2b + f + e + d = -206 ... (2)\n\nRow 3: c + a + d + a + b + a + f = 91 → 3a + b + c + d + f = 91 ... (3)\n\nRow 4: f + d + a + a + b + b + a = -100 → 3a + 2b + d + f = -100 ... (4)\n\nRow 5: a + a + a + c + c + a + f = 338 → 4a + 2c + f = 338 ... (5)\n\nRow 6: e + e + a + a + e + a + d = -241 → 3a + 3e + d = -241 ... (6)\n\nRow 7: c + b + c + d + a + a + c = 202 → 2a + b + 3c + d = 202 ... (7)\n\nRow 8: b + c + c + f + f + b + f = 208 → 2b + 2c + 3f = 208 ... (8)\n\nRow 9: e + e + c + b + c + c + c = 125 → 2e + b + 4c = 125 ... (9)\n\nSo now we have 9 equations with 6 variables. Let me write them again:\n\nEquation (1): 2a + b + c + 2d + f = 35  \nEquation (2): 2a + 2b + d + e + f = -206  \nEquation (3): 3a + b + c + d + f = 91  \nEquation (4): 3a + 2b + d + f = -100  \nEquation (5): 4a + 2c + f = 338  \nEquation (6): 3a + 3e + d = -241  \nEquation (7): 2a + b + 3c + d = 202  \nEquation (8): 2b + 2c + 3f = 208  \nEquation (9): 2e + b + 4c = 125  \n\nNow, solving these equations step by step. Let's see if we can find relationships between variables.\n\nFirst, maybe subtract equations to eliminate variables. Let's look for equations that can be subtracted to eliminate variables.\n\nLooking at equations (3) and (4):\n\nEquation (3): 3a + b + c + d + f = 91  \nEquation (4): 3a + 2b + d + f = -100  \nSubtract (3) from (4): (3a -3a) + (2b -b) + (d -d) + (f -f) + ( ... ) → 0 + b -c = -100 -91 → b - c = -191 → b = c -191 ... (A)\n\nSo equation A: b = c - 191.\n\nNow, equation (5): 4a + 2c + f = 338.\n\nEquation (7): 2a + b + 3c + d = 202. Let's substitute b from equation A here.\n\nEquation (7) becomes: 2a + (c - 191) + 3c + d = 202 → 2a +4c -191 +d = 202 → 2a + d +4c = 393 ... (7a)\n\nSimilarly, equation (1): 2a + b + c + 2d + f = 35. Substitute b = c -191:\n\n2a + (c -191) + c + 2d + f = 35 → 2a + 2c + 2d + f = 35 +191 → 2a + 2c + 2d + f = 226 ... (1a)\n\nEquation (3): 3a + b + c + d + f = 91. Substitute b = c -191:\n\n3a + (c -191) + c + d + f = 91 → 3a + 2c + d + f = 91 +191 → 3a +2c +d +f = 282 ... (3a)\n\nEquation (4): 3a + 2b + d + f = -100. Substitute b = c-191:\n\n3a + 2(c -191) + d + f = -100 → 3a + 2c -382 + d + f = -100 → 3a +2c +d +f = 282. Wait, that's the same as equation (3a). So equation (4) after substitution becomes same as (3a). Which makes sense since we derived equation A from equations 3 and 4. So no new info here.\n\nLooking at equation (5): 4a +2c +f = 338. Let's note that.\n\nEquation (8): 2b + 2c + 3f = 208. Substitute b = c -191:\n\n2(c -191) + 2c +3f = 208 → 2c - 382 + 2c +3f = 208 → 4c +3f = 208 +382 = 590 → 4c +3f = 590 ... (8a)\n\nEquation (9): 2e + b +4c = 125. Substitute b = c -191:\n\n2e + (c -191) +4c = 125 → 2e +5c -191 =125 → 2e +5c = 316 ... (9a)\n\nEquation (6): 3a +3e +d = -241. Let's note that.\n\nNow, let's see if we can find more equations.\n\nLooking at equation (7a): 2a + d +4c = 393 → d = 393 -2a -4c ... (7b)\n\nLet me plug equation (7b) into equation (3a): 3a +2c +d +f = 282. Substituting d:\n\n3a +2c + (393 -2a -4c) + f = 282 → 3a -2a +2c -4c +393 +f = 282 → a -2c +f = 282 -393 → a -2c +f = -111 → a +f = 2c -111 ... (3b)\n\nNow, equation (5): 4a +2c +f = 338. Let's substitute a +f from (3b). Since a +f = 2c -111, then f = 2c -111 -a. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps express f from (3b):\n\nFrom (3b): a + f = 2c -111 → f = 2c -111 -a. Let's substitute this into equation (5):\n\n4a +2c + (2c -111 -a) = 338 → 4a -a +2c +2c -111 = 338 → 3a +4c = 338 +111 = 449 → 3a +4c = 449 ... (5a)\n\nSo now equation (5a): 3a +4c = 449.\n\nAlso, equation (1a): 2a + 2c + 2d + f = 226. Let me substitute d from (7b) and f from (3b).\n\nFrom (7b): d = 393 -2a -4c.\n\nFrom (3b): f = 2c -111 -a.\n\nSo substituting into equation (1a):\n\n2a + 2c + 2*(393 -2a -4c) + (2c -111 -a) = 226.\n\nLet me compute this step by step:\n\nFirst, expand the terms:\n\n2a + 2c + 2*393 - 2*2a - 2*4c + 2c -111 -a = 226.\n\nCalculate each part:\n\n2a + 2c + 786 -4a -8c + 2c -111 -a.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(2a -4a -a) + (2c -8c +2c) + (786 -111) \n\n= (-3a) + (-4c) + 675 \n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n-3a -4c + 675 = 226 → -3a -4c = 226 -675 → -3a -4c = -449 → multiply both sides by -1: 3a +4c = 449. Which is the same as equation (5a). So again, no new info here. So equations are consistent.\n\nSo, we have equation (5a): 3a +4c = 449.\n\nNow, need another equation involving a and c. Let's see if we can find more.\n\nLooking at equation (7a): 2a + d +4c = 393, and equation (7b): d = 393 -2a -4c. But that's already used.\n\nLooking at equation (3a) and others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use equation (8a): 4c +3f = 590. And since from (3b): f = 2c -111 -a, substitute into equation (8a):\n\n4c +3*(2c -111 -a) = 590 → 4c +6c -333 -3a = 590 → 10c -3a = 590 +333 → 10c -3a = 923 ... (8b)\n\nNow, from equation (5a): 3a +4c = 449 → 3a = 449 -4c → a = (449 -4c)/3.\n\nSubstitute this into equation (8b):\n\n10c -3*( (449 -4c)/3 ) = 923 → 10c - (449 -4c) = 923 → 10c -449 +4c = 923 → 14c = 923 +449 = 1372 → c = 1372 /14 = 98.\n\nSo c = 98. Now, let's find a from equation (5a):\n\n3a +4*98 = 449 → 3a + 392 = 449 → 3a = 57 → a = 19.\n\nSo a = 19, c = 98.\n\nNow, from equation A: b = c -191 → b = 98 -191 = -93.\n\nNow, let's find f from equation (3b): a +f = 2c -111 → 19 +f = 2*98 -111 → 19 +f = 196 -111 = 85 → f = 85 -19 = 66.\n\nSo f = 66.\n\nNow, equation (7b): d = 393 -2a -4c → d = 393 -2*19 -4*98 → 393 -38 -392 → 393 - 430 = -37. So d = -37.\n\nNow, let's find e. Let's look at equation (6): 3a +3e +d = -241. We have a=19, d=-37. So:\n\n3*19 +3e + (-37) = -241 → 57 -37 +3e = -241 → 20 +3e = -241 → 3e = -261 → e = -87.\n\nNow, check equation (9a): 2e +5c = 316. Let's verify:\n\n2*(-87) +5*98 = -174 +490 = 316. Yes, correct.\n\nNow, let's check equation (8a): 4c +3f = 590. 4*98 = 392, 3*66=198. 392 +198=590. Correct.\n\nNow, check equation (5): 4a +2c +f = 4*19 +2*98 +66 = 76 +196 +66 = 338. Correct.\n\nNow, check equation (7): 2a +b +3c +d = 2*19 + (-93) + 3*98 + (-37) = 38 -93 +294 -37 = (38 +294) - (93 +37) = 332 - 130 = 202. Correct.\n\nNow, check equation (2): 2a +2b +d +e +f = 2*19 + 2*(-93) + (-37) + (-87) +66. Let's compute:\n\n38 -186 -37 -87 +66 = (38 +66) - (186 +37 +87) = 104 - 310 = -206. Correct.\n\nEquation (3): 3a +b +c +d +f = 3*19 + (-93) +98 + (-37) +66. Let's compute:\n\n57 -93 +98 -37 +66 = (57 +98 +66) - (93 +37) = 221 - 130 = 91. Correct.\n\nEquation (4): 3a +2b +d +f = 3*19 + 2*(-93) + (-37) +66. 57 -186 -37 +66 = (57 +66) - (186 +37) = 123 - 223 = -100. Correct.\n\nEquation (1): 2a +b +c +2d +f = 2*19 + (-93) +98 + 2*(-37) +66. Let's compute:\n\n38 -93 +98 -74 +66. (38 +98 +66) - (93 +74) = 202 - 167 = 35. Correct.\n\nEquation (6): 3a +3e +d = 3*19 +3*(-87) + (-37) = 57 -261 -37 = 57 -298 = -241. Correct.\n\nEquation (9): 2e +b +4c = 2*(-87) + (-93) +4*98 = -174 -93 +392 = 125. Correct.\n\nSo all equations are satisfied. Now, we have the values of all symbols:\n\na (≤) = 19  \nb (♠) = -93  \nc (∅) = 98  \nd (♦) = -37  \ne (↑) = -87  \nf (∝) = 66  \n\nNow, with these values, we can compute each column's sum. There are 7 columns, each with 9 entries. Let's process each column by looking at each row's symbols and adding the corresponding values.\n\nLet me list each column's symbols across the 9 rows. Let's index columns from 0 to 6 (assuming first column is column 0). Let me go row by row and extract the symbols for each column.\n\nFirst, let me write down each row's symbols:\n\nRow 1: ≤, ♠, ∅, ♦, ≤, ♦, ∝  \nRow 2: ♠, ∝, ≤, ♠, ↑, ≤, ♦  \nRow 3: ∅, ≤, ♦, ≤, ♠, ≤, ∝  \nRow 4: ∝, ♦, ≤, ≤, ♠, ♠, ≤  \nRow 5: ≤, ≤, ≤, ∅, ∅, ≤, ∝  \nRow 6: ↑, ↑, ≤, ≤, ↑, ≤, ♦  \nRow 7: ∅, ♠, ∅, ♦, ≤, ≤, ∅  \nRow 8: ♠, ∅, ∅, ∝, ∝, ♠, ∝  \nRow 9: ↑, ↑, ∅, ♠, ∅, ∅, ∅  \n\nNow, for each column (columns 0 to 6):\n\nLet me create a list for each column:\n\nColumn 0:\nRow1: ≤ (a=19)\nRow2: ♠ (b=-93)\nRow3: ∅ (c=98)\nRow4: ∝ (f=66)\nRow5: ≤ (a=19)\nRow6: ↑ (e=-87)\nRow7: ∅ (c=98)\nRow8: ♠ (b=-93)\nRow9: ↑ (e=-87)\n\nColumn 0 values: 19, -93, 98, 66, 19, -87, 98, -93, -87\n\nColumn 1:\nRow1: ♠ (b=-93)\nRow2: ∝ (f=66)\nRow3: ≤ (a=19)\nRow4: ♦ (d=-37)\nRow5: ≤ (a=19)\nRow6: ↑ (e=-87)\nRow7: ♠ (b=-93)\nRow8: ∅ (c=98)\nRow9: ↑ (e=-87)\n\nColumn 1 values: -93, 66, 19, -37, 19, -87, -93, 98, -87\n\nColumn 2:\nRow1: ∅ (c=98)\nRow2: ≤ (a=19)\nRow3: ♦ (d=-37)\nRow4: ≤ (a=19)\nRow5: ≤ (a=19)\nRow6: ≤ (a=19)\nRow7: ∅ (c=98)\nRow8: ∅ (c=98)\nRow9: ∅ (c=98)\n\nColumn 2 values: 98, 19, -37, 19, 19, 19, 98, 98, 98\n\nColumn 3:\nRow1: ♦ (d=-37)\nRow2: ♠ (b=-93)\nRow3: ≤ (a=19)\nRow4: ≤ (a=19)\nRow5: ∅ (c=98)\nRow6: ≤ (a=19)\nRow7: ♦ (d=-37)\nRow8: ∝ (f=66)\nRow9: ♠ (b=-93)\n\nColumn 3 values: -37, -93, 19, 19, 98, 19, -37, 66, -93\n\nColumn 4:\nRow1: ≤ (a=19)\nRow2: ↑ (e=-87)\nRow3: ♠ (b=-93)\nRow4: ♠ (b=-93)\nRow5: ∅ (c=98)\nRow6: ↑ (e=-87)\nRow7: ≤ (a=19)\nRow8: ∝ (f=66)\nRow9: ∅ (c=98)\n\nColumn 4 values: 19, -87, -93, -93, 98, -87, 19, 66, 98\n\nColumn 5:\nRow1: ♦ (d=-37)\nRow2: ≤ (a=19)\nRow3: ≤ (a=19)\nRow4: ♠ (b=-93)\nRow5: ≤ (a=19)\nRow6: ≤ (a=19)\nRow7: ≤ (a=19)\nRow8: ♠ (b=-93)\nRow9: ∅ (c=98)\n\nColumn 5 values: -37, 19, 19, -93, 19, 19, 19, -93, 98\n\nColumn 6:\nRow1: ∝ (f=66)\nRow2: ♦ (d=-37)\nRow3: ∝ (f=66)\nRow4: ≤ (a=19)\nRow5: ∝ (f=66)\nRow6: ♦ (d=-37)\nRow7: ∅ (c=98)\nRow8: ∝ (f=66)\nRow9: ∅ (c=98)\n\nColumn 6 values: 66, -37, 66, 19, 66, -37, 98, 66, 98\n\nNow, compute the sum for each column.\n\nLet's compute each column's sum one by one.\n\nColumn 0:\n19 + (-93) = -74\n-74 +98 = 24\n24 +66 = 90\n90 +19 = 109\n109 + (-87) = 22\n22 +98 = 120\n120 + (-93) = 27\n27 + (-87) = -60\n\nSo column 0 sum is -60.\n\nColumn 1:\n-93 +66 = -27\n-27 +19 = -8\n-8 + (-37) = -45\n-45 +19 = -26\n-26 + (-87) = -113\n-113 + (-93) = -206\n-206 +98 = -108\n-108 + (-87) = -195\n\nWait, let me recheck:\n\nWait the values for column 1 are: -93, 66, 19, -37, 19, -87, -93, 98, -87.\n\nLet me add step by step:\n\nStart with 0.\n\nAdd -93 → -93\n\nAdd 66 → -27\n\nAdd 19 → -8\n\nAdd -37 → -45\n\nAdd 19 → -26\n\nAdd -87 → -113\n\nAdd -93 → -206\n\nAdd 98 → -108\n\nAdd -87 → -195.\n\nYes, column 1 sum is -195.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nValues: 98, 19, -37, 19, 19, 19, 98, 98, 98.\n\nLet me add:\n\nStart with 98.\n\n+19 → 117\n\n-37 → 80\n\n+19 → 99\n\n+19 → 118\n\n+19 → 137\n\n+98 → 235\n\n+98 → 333\n\n+98 → 431.\n\nSo column 2 sum is 431.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nValues: -37, -93, 19, 19, 98, 19, -37, 66, -93.\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nStart with 0.\n\n-37 → -37\n\n-93 → -130\n\n+19 → -111\n\n+19 → -92\n\n+98 → 6\n\n+19 → 25\n\n-37 → -12\n\n+66 → 54\n\n-93 → -39.\n\nColumn 3 sum is -39.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nValues: 19, -87, -93, -93, 98, -87, 19, 66, 98.\n\nAdding step by step:\n\nStart with 19.\n\n-87 → -68\n\n-93 → -161\n\n-93 → -254\n\n+98 → -156\n\n-87 → -243\n\n+19 → -224\n\n+66 → -158\n\n+98 → -60.\n\nColumn 4 sum is -60.\n\nColumn 5:\n\nValues: -37, 19, 19, -93, 19, 19, 19, -93, 98.\n\nAdding:\n\nStart with -37.\n\n+19 → -18\n\n+19 → -(-18 +19=1?)\n\nWait:\n\n-37 +19 = -18\n\n-18 +19 = 1\n\n1 + (-93) = -92\n\n-92 +19 = -73\n\n-73 +19 = -54\n\n-54 +19 = -35\n\n-35 + (-93) = -128\n\n-128 +98 = -30.\n\nSo column 5 sum is -30.\n\nColumn 6:\n\nValues: 66, -37, 66, 19, 66, -37, 98, 66, 98.\n\nAdding step by step:\n\nStart with 66.\n\n-37 → 29\n\n+66 → 95\n\n+19 → 114\n\n+66 → 180\n\n-37 → 143\n\n+98 → 241\n\n+66 → 307\n\n+98 → 405.\n\nSo column 6 sum is 405.\n\nWait let me verify:\n\n66 + (-37) = 29  \n29 +66 = 95  \n95 +19 = 114  \n114 +66 = 180  \n180 + (-37) = 143  \n143 +98 = 241  \n241 +66 = 307  \n307 +98 = 405.

      "Okay, let's see. I need to find the column sums based on the given grid and row sums. First, I should probably figure out what each symbol represents numerically. The grid has symbols like /, ↑, →, ♦. Each row has a sum provided. So maybe I can set up equations for each row based on the symbols and solve for their values.\n\nLet me start by assigning variables to each symbol. Let's say:\n- Let / be A\n- ↑ be B\n- → be C\n- ♦ be D\n\nEach row in the grid is a combination of these symbols, and their sum equals the given row total. For example, the first row is \"/↑/♦/\" with sum -85. That would translate to A + B + A + D + A = 3A + B + D = -85. Let me write down all the equations for each row.\n\nRow 1: /↑/♦/ → A, B, A, D, A → 3A + B + D = -85\nRow 2: →//♦/ → C, A, A, D, A → C + 3A + D = -50\nRow 3: /♦↑♦↑ → A, D, B, D, B → A + 2D + 2B = -110\nRow 4: ♦→→♦♦ → D, C, C, D, D → D + 3C + 2D? Wait, wait. Wait the symbols are D, C, C, D, D. So that's D + C + C + D + D = D*3 + C*2 = 3D + 2C = -77\nRow 5: →♦♦→→ → C, D, D, C, C → C + 2D + 2C = 3C + 2D = 7\nRow 6: →/↑→↑ → C, A, B, C, B → C + A + B + C + B = A + 2C + 2B = 58\nRow 7: ♦↑→↑↑ → D, B, C, B, B → D + B + C + 2B = D + C + 3B = -14\nRow 8: ↑→♦→♦ → B, C, D, C, D → B + 2C + 2D = -28\nRow 9: →→♦→→ → C, C, D, C, C → 4C + D = 91\nRow 10: /→↑♦↑ → A, C, B, D, B → A + C + B + D + B = A + C + 2B + D = -26\n\nSo now I have 10 equations with four variables. That's overdetermined, but maybe there's a unique solution. Let me try solving them step by step.\n\nLet me list all equations:\n\n1. 3A + B + D = -85\n2. C + 3A + D = -50\n3. A + 2D + 2B = -110\n4. 3D + 2C = -77\n5. 3C + 2D = 7\n6. A + 2C + 2B = 58\n7. D + C + 3B = -14\n8. B + 2C + 2D = -28\n9. 4C + D = 91\n10. A + C + 2B + D = -26\n\nHmm. Let's see. Maybe start with equations that have fewer variables. Let's look at equations 4,5,9 which involve C and D.\n\nEquation 4: 3D + 2C = -77\nEquation 5: 3C + 2D = 7\nEquation 9: 4C + D = 91\n\nLet me try solving equations 4 and 5 first. Let me write them again:\n\nFrom equation 4: 2C + 3D = -77\nFrom equation 5: 3C + 2D = 7\n\nLet me solve these two equations. Let's use elimination. Multiply equation 4 by 3 and equation 5 by 2:\n\nEquation 4 *3: 6C + 9D = -231\nEquation 5 *2: 6C + 4D = 14\n\nSubtract the second from the first:\n\n(6C +9D) - (6C +4D) = -231 -14 → 5D = -245 → D = -49\n\nNow plug D = -49 into equation 5: 3C + 2*(-49) =7 → 3C -98 =7 → 3C=105 → C=35.\n\nSo C=35, D=-49. Let me check equation 9: 4C + D =4*35 + (-49)=140-49=91. Yes, that works. Great.\n\nNow we have C=35 and D=-49.\n\nNow let's use equation 2: C +3A + D = -50. Plug in C and D:\n\n35 +3A -49 = -50 → (35-49) +3A = -50 → -14 +3A = -50 → 3A = -36 → A= -12.\n\nSo A=-12.\n\nNow equation 1: 3A + B + D = -85. Plug A=-12, D=-49:\n\n3*(-12) + B -49 = -85 → -36 -49 + B = -85 → -85 + B = -85 → B=0.\n\nSo B=0. Let me check with equation 6: A + 2C + 2B = -12 + 2*35 + 2*0 = -12 +70=58. Which matches equation 6's right-hand side of 58. Good.\n\nNow check equation 7: D + C +3B = -49 +35 +0= -14. Which matches equation 7's -14. Good.\n\nEquation 8: B + 2C +2D = 0 + 2*35 +2*(-49) =70 -98= -28. Which matches equation 8's -28. Good.\n\nEquation 3: A +2D +2B = -12 + 2*(-49) + 0 = -12 -98 = -110. Which matches equation 3. Good.\n\nEquation 10: A + C +2B + D = -12 +35 +0 + (-49) = (-12-49) +35= -61 +35= -26. Which matches equation 10. Perfect.\n\nSo all equations are satisfied with A=-12, B=0, C=35, D=-49.\n\nNow, with these values, we need to compute the column sums. The grid has 5 columns. Each column's sum is the sum of each row's element in that column.\n\nBut first, we need to know what each cell in the grid is. Let me reconstruct the grid with symbols replaced by their values.\n\nLet me list each row's symbols again, replacing with their numerical values:\n\nRow 1: / ↑ / ♦ / → A, B, A, D, A → -12, 0, -12, -49, -12\nRow 2: → / / ♦ / → C, A, A, D, A → 35, -12, -12, -49, -12\nRow 3: / ♦ ↑ ♦ ↑ → A, D, B, D, B → -12, -49, 0, -49, 0\nRow 4: ♦ → → ♦ ♦ → D, C, C, D, D → -49, 35, 35, -49, -49\nRow 5: → ♦ ♦ → → → C, D, D, C, C → 35, -49, -49, 35, 35\nRow 6: → / ↑ → ↑ → C, A, B, C, B → 35, -12, 0, 35, 0\nRow 7: ♦ ↑ → ↑ ↑ → D, B, C, B, B → -49, 0, 35, 0, 0\nRow 8: ↑ → ♦ → ♦ → B, C, D, C, D → 0, 35, -49, 35, -49\nRow 9: → → ♦ → → → C, C, D, C, C → 35, 35, -49, 35, 35\nRow 10: / → ↑ ♦ ↑ → A, C, B, D, B → -12, 35, 0, -49, 0\n\nNow, to compute column sums. There are 5 columns. Let's go column by column.\n\nColumn 1: All first elements of each row.\n\nRow1: -12\nRow2: 35\nRow3: -12\nRow4: -49\nRow5: 35\nRow6: 35\nRow7: -49\nRow8: 0\nRow9: 35\nRow10: -12\n\nSum column 1:\n-12 +35 = 23\n23 + (-12) = 11\n11 + (-49) = -38\n-38 +35 = -3\n-3 +35 = 32\n32 + (-49) = -17\n-17 +0 = -17\n-17 +35 = 18\n18 + (-12) = 6\n\nSo column 1 sum is 6.\n\nColumn 2: Second elements of each row.\n\nRow1: 0\nRow2: -12\nRow3: -49\nRow4: 35\nRow5: -49\nRow6: -12\nRow7: 0\nRow8: 35\nRow9: 35\nRow10: 35\n\nLet's add them:\n\n0 + (-12) = -12\n-12 + (-49) = -61\n-61 +35 = -26\n-26 + (-49) = -75\n-75 + (-12) = -87\n-87 +0 = -87\n-87 +35 = -52\n-52 +35 = -17\n-17 +35 = 18\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again:\n\nWait, row3's second element is D? Wait no. Let me recheck each row's column 2:\n\nRow1: B (0)\nRow2: A (-12)\nRow3: D (-49)\nRow4: C (35)\nRow5: D (-49)\nRow6: A (-12)\nRow7: B (0)\nRow8: C (35)\nRow9: C (35)\nRow10: C (35)\n\nYes. So the numbers are:\n\n0, -12, -49, 35, -49, -12, 0, 35, 35, 35.\n\nAdding them:\n\nStart adding step by step:\n\nStart with 0.\n\nAdd -12 → -12\n\nAdd -49 → -61\n\nAdd 35 → -26\n\nAdd -49 → -75\n\nAdd -12 → -87\n\nAdd 0 → -87\n\nAdd 35 → -52\n\nAdd 35 → -17\n\nAdd 35 → 18.\n\nSo column 2 sum is 18.\n\nColumn 3: Third elements.\n\nRow1: A (-12)\nRow2: A (-12)\nRow3: B (0)\nRow4: C (35)\nRow5: D (-49)\nRow6: B (0)\nRow7: C (35)\nRow8: D (-49)\nRow9: D (-49)\nRow10: B (0)\n\nSo the numbers are:\n\n-12, -12, 0, 35, -49, 0, 35, -49, -49, 0.\n\nAdding them:\n\nStart with -12 -12 = -24\n\n+0 → -24\n\n+35 → 11\n\n-49 → -38\n\n+0 → -38\n\n+35 → -3\n\n-49 → -52\n\n-49 → -101\n\n+0 → -101.\n\nSo column 3 sum is -101?\n\nWait let me check again:\n\nRow1: -12\n\nRow2: -12 → total -24\n\nRow3: 0 → -24\n\nRow4: +35 → 11\n\nRow5: -49 → 11-49=-38\n\nRow6: 0 → -38\n\nRow7: +35 → -3\n\nRow8: -49 → -52\n\nRow9: -49 → -101\n\nRow10: 0 → -101. Yes. So column 3 sum is -101.\n\nColumn 4: Fourth elements of each row.\n\nRow1: D (-49)\nRow2: D (-49)\nRow3: D (-49)\nRow4: D (-49)\nRow5: C (35)\nRow6: C (35)\nRow7: B (0)\nRow8: D (-49)\nRow9: C (35)\nRow10: D (-49)\n\nSo the numbers:\n\n-49, -49, -49, -49, 35, 35, 0, -49, 35, -49.\n\nAdding them:\n\nStart with -49*4 = -196 (rows 1-4)\n\nAdd 35 +35 (rows5 and 6) → -196 +70 = -126\n\nAdd 0 → -126\n\nAdd -49 (row8) → -175\n\nAdd 35 (row9) → -140\n\nAdd -49 (row10) → -189.\n\nSo column 4 sum is -189.\n\nWait let me recount:\n\nRow1: -49\n\nRow2: -49 → total -98\n\nRow3: -49 → -147\n\nRow4: -49 → -196\n\nRow5: 35 → -161\n\nRow6: 35 → -126\n\nRow7: 0 → -126\n\nRow8: -49 → -175\n\nRow9: 35 → -140\n\nRow10: -49 → -189. Yes. Correct.\n\nColumn 5: Fifth elements.\n\nRow1: A (-12)\nRow2: A (-12)\nRow3: B (0)\nRow4: D (-49)\nRow5: C (35)\nRow6: B (0)\nRow7: B (0)\nRow8: D (-49)\nRow9: C (35)\nRow10: B (0)\n\nNumbers: -12, -12, 0, -49, 35, 0, 0, -49, 35, 0.\n\nAdding them:\n\nStart with -12 -12 = -24\n\n+0 → -24\n\n-49 → -73\n\n+35 → -38\n\n+0 → -38\n\n+0 → -38\n\n-49 → -87\n\n+35 → -52\n\n+0 → -52.\n\nSo column 5 sum is -52.\n\nSo compiling all column sums:\n\nColumn 1: 6\n\nColumn 2: 18\n\nColumn 3: -101\n\nColumn 4: -189\n\nColumn 5: -52\n\nTherefore, the answer should be [6, 18, -101, -189, -52].\n\nLet me check if these numbers make sense. Let me also verify with row sums. The total of all row sums should equal the total of all column sums.\n\nSum of all row sums given:\n\n-85 + (-50) = -135\n\n-135 + (-110) = -245\n\n-245 + (-77) = -322\n\n-322 +7 = -315\n\n-315 +58 = -257\n\n-257 + (-14) = -271\n\n-271 + (-28) = -299\n\n-299 +91 = -208\n\n-208 + (-26) = -234.\n\nNow sum of column sums: 6 +18 =24; 24 + (-101)= -77; -77 + (-189)= -266; -266 + (-52)= -318. Wait, that's -318. But the total row sum is -234. There's a discrepancy here. That means I made a mistake in calculating column sums. Oh no! Where did I go wrong?\n\nHmm, this is a problem. The sum of all row sums must equal the sum of all column sums. Since the row sums add up to -234, but the column sums I calculated add up to 6 +18 -101 -189 -52 = let's compute:\n\n6 +18 =24; 24 -101 = -77; -77 -189 = -266; -266 -52 = -318. Which is not equal to -234. So there must be an error in my column calculations. Let me check again.\n\nLet me recheck each column sum.\n\nFirst, let's recalculate column sums carefully.\n\nLet me start with column 1 again.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow1: -12\n\nRow2: 35 → total 23\n\nRow3: -12 → 23-12=11\n\nRow4: -49 → 11-49=-38\n\nRow5: 35 → -38+35=-3\n\nRow6: 35 → -3+35=32\n\nRow7: -49 → 32-49=-17\n\nRow8: 0 → -17\n\nRow9: 35 → -17+35=18\n\nRow10: -12 → 18-12=6. Yes. Column 1 sum is 6. Correct.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nNumbers: 0, -12, -49, 35, -49, -12, 0, 35, 35, 35.\n\nAdding:\n\nStart with 0.\n\nAdd -12 → -12.\n\nAdd -49 → -61.\n\nAdd 35 → -26.\n\nAdd -49 → -75.\n\nAdd -12 → -87.\n\nAdd 0 → -87.\n\nAdd 35 → -52.\n\nAdd 35 → -17.\n\nAdd 35 → 18. Correct. Column 2 sum is 18. So that's correct.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nNumbers: -12 (row1), -12 (row2), 0 (row3), 35 (row4), -49 (row5), 0 (row6), 35 (row7), -49 (row8), -49 (row9), 0 (row10).\n\nLet me add them again:\n\nStart with 0.\n\nRow1: -12 → -12\n\nRow2: -12 → -24\n\nRow3: 0 → -24\n\nRow4: +35 → 11\n\nRow5: -49 → -38\n\nRow6: 0 → -38\n\nRow7: +35 → -3\n\nRow8: -49 → -52\n\nRow9: -49 → -101\n\nRow10: 0 → -101. So column 3 is -101. Correct?\n\nYes. But then column 3 is -101.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nNumbers: row1: D=-49; row2: D=-49; row3: D=-49; row4: D=-49; row5: C=35; row6: C=35; row7: B=0; row8: D=-49; row9: C=35; row10: D=-49.\n\nSo numbers: -49, -49, -49, -49, 35, 35, 0, -49, 35, -49.\n\nAdding:\n\nStart with 0.\n\nRow1: -49 → -49\n\nRow2: -49 → -98\n\nRow3: -49 → -147\n\nRow4: -49 → -196\n\nRow5: +35 → -161\n\nRow6: +35 → -126\n\nRow7: +0 → -126\n\nRow8: -49 → -175\n\nRow9: +35 → -140\n\nRow10: -49 → -189. So column 4 is -189. Correct?\n\nYes. So column 4 sum is -189.\n\nColumn 5:\n\nNumbers: row1: A=-12; row2: A=-12; row3: B=0; row4: D=-49; row5: C=35; row6: B=0; row7: B=0; row8: D=-49; row9: C=35; row10: B=0.\n\nNumbers: -12, -12, 0, -49, 35, 0, 0, -49, 35, 0.\n\nAdding:\n\nStart with 0.\n\nRow1: -12 → -12\n\nRow2: -12 → -24\n\nRow3: 0 → -24\n\nRow4: -49 → -73\n\nRow5: +35 → -38\n\nRow6: 0 → -38\n\nRow7: 0 → -38\n\nRow8: -49 → -87\n\nRow9: +35 → -52\n\nRow10: 0 → -52. So column 5 sum is -52. Correct.\n\nNow total column sums: 6 +18 -101 -189 -52 = ?\n\nLet me calculate:\n\n6 +18 =24\n\n24 -101 = -77\n\n-77 -189 = -266\n\n-266 -52 = -318.\n\nBut the row sums total to -234. There's a discrepancy of -318 vs -234. Which means I must have made a mistake in my calculations. Let me check again. Where is the error?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the row sums? Let me check the given row sums again.\n\nThe given row sums are:\n\nRow1: -85\n\nRow2: -50\n\nRow3: -110\n\nRow4: -77\n\nRow5: 7\n\nRow6: 58\n\nRow7: -14\n\nRow8: -28\n\nRow9: 91\n\nRow10: -26\n\nAdding them:\n\nLet me add them step by step:\n\nStart with 0.\n\nAdd -85 → -85\n\nAdd -50 → -135\n\nAdd -110 → -245\n\nAdd -77 → -322\n\nAdd 7 → -315\n\nAdd 58 → -257\n\nAdd -14 → -271\n\nAdd -28 → -299\n\nAdd 91 → -208\n\nAdd -26 → -234. Yes, total row sum is -234.\n\nBut column sums total -318. So there's a difference of -84. So I must have made a mistake in calculating the column sums. Let me check again.\n\nLet me check column 3 again. Maybe I miscalculated there.\n\nColumn 3: third elements:\n\nRow1: A (-12)\n\nRow2: A (-12)\n\nRow3: B (0)\n\nRow4: C (35)\n\nRow5: D (-49)\n\nRow6: B (0)\n\nRow7: C (35)\n\nRow8: D (-49)\n\nRow9: D (-49)\n\nRow10: B (0)\n\nSo numbers: -12, -12, 0, 35, -49, 0, 35, -49, -49, 0.\n\nLet me add them again:\n\n-12 + (-12) = -24\n\n+0 → -24\n\n+35 → 11\n\n+(-49) → -38\n\n+0 → -38\n\n+35 → -3\n\n+(-49) → -52\n\n+(-49) → -101\n\n+0 → -101. So column 3 is -101. Correct?\n\nYes. So that's right. \n\nColumn 4: fourth elements:\n\nNumbers: -49, -49, -49, -49, 35, 35, 0, -49, 35, -49.\n\nLet me add them again:\n\nStart with 0.\n\nRow1: -49 → -49\n\nRow2: -49 → -98\n\nRow3: -49 → -147\n\nRow4: -49 → -196\n\nRow5: +35 → -161\n\nRow6: +35 → -126\n\nRow7: +0 → -126\n\nRow8: -49 → -175\n\nRow9: +35 → -140\n\nRow10: -49 → -189. Correct.\n\nColumn 5 sum: -52. Correct.\n\nHmm. So where is the mistake? Let me check if I made a mistake in assigning the symbols to the rows. Maybe I misread the grid.\n\nLet me recheck the grid rows:\n\nOriginal grid:\n\nRow1: /↑/♦/ → symbols: /, ↑, /, ♦, / → correct.\n\nRow2: →//♦/ → →, /, /, ♦, / → correct.\n\nRow3: /♦↑♦↑ → /, ♦, ↑, ♦, ↑ → correct.\n\nRow4: ♦→→♦♦ → ♦, →, →, ♦, ♦ → correct.\n\nRow5: →♦♦→→ → →, ♦, ♦, →, → → correct.\n\nRow6: →/↑→↑ → →, /, ↑, →, ↑ → correct.\n\nRow7: ♦↑→↑↑ → ♦, ↑, →, ↑, ↑ → correct.\n\nRow8: ↑→♦→♦ → ↑, →, ♦, →, ♦ → correct.\n\nRow9: →→♦→→ → →, →, ♦, →, → → correct.\n\nRow10: /→↑♦↑ → /, →, ↑, ♦, ↑ → correct.\n\nSo symbols are correct. Then the values for each row are correct?\n\nLet me check row sums with the values I calculated for each row. For example, row1: 3A + B + D = 3*(-12) +0 + (-49) = -36 -49 = -85. Correct. Row2: C +3A +D = 35 +3*(-12) + (-49) = 35 -36 -49 = -50. Correct. Row3: A +2D +2B = -12 + 2*(-49) +0= -12-98= -110. Correct. Row4: 3D +2C = 3*(-49) +2*35= -147 +70= -77. Correct. Row5: 3C +2D= 3*35 +2*(-49)= 105-98=7. Correct. Row6: A +2C +2B= -12 +70 +0=58. Correct. Row7: D +C +3B= -49 +35 +0= -14. Correct. Row8: B +2C +2D= 0 +70 +2*(-49)=70-98=-28. Correct. Row9:4C +D= 140-49=91. Correct. Row10: A +C +2B +D= -12+35+0-49= -26. Correct. All row sums are correct. So the problem must be in column sums. \n\nWait, but how? If all row sums are correct, then the total should be the same as column sums. Let me calculate the total of all elements in the grid using the row sums. It's -234. Now calculate the sum of column sums I found: -318. There's a difference of -84. So there must be an error in column sums.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let me calculate the sum of all elements in the grid by adding up the row sums: -234. Now calculate the sum of the column sums I found: 6 +18 -101 -189 -52 = let's calculate again:\n\n6 +18 is 24\n\n24 -101 is -77\n\n-77 -189 is -266\n\n-266 -52 is -318. \n\nDifference: -318 - (-234) = -84. So there's an error of -84. Which means that I have some mistake in column sums. Let me check each column again.\n\nLet me try calculating column sums again, perhaps I made a mistake in the individual column calculations.\n\nLet me start with column 1 again. \n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow1: -12\n\nRow2: 35 → -12 +35 = 23\n\nRow3: -12 → 23-12=11\n\nRow4: -49 → 11-49=-38\n\nRow5: 35 → -38+35=-3\n\nRow6: 35 → -3+35=32\n\nRow7: -49 → 32-49=-17\n\nRow8: 0 → -17+0=-17\n\nRow9: 35 → -17+35=18\n\nRow10: -12 → 18-12=6. Correct. Column 1 sum is 6.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow1: 0\n\nRow2: -12 → 0-12=-12\n\nRow3: -49 → -12-49=-61\n\nRow4: 35 → -61+35=-26\n\nRow5: -49 → -26-49=-75\n\nRow6: -12 → -75-12=-87\n\nRow7: 0 → -87+0=-87\n\nRow8: 35 → -87+35=-52\n\nRow9: 35 → -52+35=-17\n\nRow10: 35 → -17+35=18. Correct. Column 2 sum is 18.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow1: -12\n\nRow2: -12 → -24\n\nRow3: 0 → -24\n\nRow4: 35 → 11\n\nRow5: -49 → -38\n\nRow6: 0 → -38\n\nRow7: 35 → -3\n\nRow8: -49 → -52\n\nRow9: -49 → -101\n\nRow10: 0 → -101. Correct. Column 3 is -101.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nRow1: -49\n\nRow2: -49 → -98\n\nRow3: -49 → -147\n\nRow4: -49 → -196\n\nRow5: 35 → -161\n\nRow6: 35 → -126\n\nRow7: 0 → -126\n\nRow8: -49 → -175\n\nRow9: 35 → -140\n\nRow10: -49 → -189. Correct. Column 4 is -189.\n\nColumn 5:\n\nRow1: -12\n\nRow2: -12 → -24\n\nRow3: 0 → -24\n\nRow4: -49 → -73\n\nRow5: 35 → -38\n\nRow6: 0 → -38\n\nRow7: 0 → -38\n\nRow8: -49 → -87\n\nRow9: 35 → -52\n\nRow10: 0 → -52. Correct. Column 5 is -52.\n\nHmm. All columns seem correct. But the total is wrong. What's going on here? Maybe there's a mistake in the assignment of symbols to the grid? Let me check the grid again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the grid's symbols for some rows? Let me recheck each row's symbols and their corresponding values.\n\nFor example, row 3: /♦↑♦↑ → symbols are /, ♦, ↑, ♦, ↑ → A, D, B, D, B → correct. Values: -12, -49, 0, -49, 0 → sum is -12-49+0-49+0 = -110. Correct.\n\nRow 4: ♦→→♦♦ → symbols D, C, C, D, D → values -49, 35, 35, -49, -49 → sum is -49+35+35-49-49 = -49*3 +35*2 = -147+70=-77. Correct.\n\nRow 5: →♦♦→→ → C, D, D, C, C → values 35, -49, -49, 35, 35 → sum 35+(-49)+(-49)+35+35 = (35*3) + (-49*2) = 105 -98=7. Correct.\n\nRow 6: →/↑→↑ → C, A, B, C, B → 35, -12, 0, 35, 0 → sum 35-12+0+35+0=58. Correct.\n\nRow 7: ♦↑→↑↑ → D, B, C, B, B → -49, 0, 35, 0, 0 → sum -49+0+35+0+0=-14. Correct.\n\nRow 8: ↑→♦→♦ → B, C, D, C, D → 0,35,-49,35,-49 → sum 0+35-49+35-49= (35+35) - (49+49) =70-98=-28. Correct.\n\nRow 9: →→♦→→ → C, C, D, C, C → 35,35,-49,35,35 → sum 35*4 -49=140-49=91. Correct.\n\nRow 10: /→↑♦↑ → A, C, B, D, B → -12,35,0,-49,0 → sum -12+35+0-49+0= (-61) +35= -26. Correct.\n\nAll rows are correct. So why the discrepancy? Maybe I made a mistake in the column sums. Let me try calculating the column sums by adding all elements in each column using the row values.\n\nLet me take each row's values and write them out in a grid, then sum columns.\n\nLet me create a 10x5 grid with the numerical values:\n\nRow1: -12, 0, -12, -49, -12\n\nRow2: 35, -12, -12, -49, -12\n\nRow3: -12, -49, 0, -49, 0\n\nRow4: -49, 35, 35, -49, -49\n\nRow5: 35, -49, -49, 35, 35\n\nRow6: 35, -12, 0, 35, 0\n\nRow7: -49, 0, 35, 0, 0\n\nRow8: 0, 35, -49, 35, -49\n\nRow9: 35, 35, -49, 35, 35\n\nRow10: -12, 35, 0, -49, 0\n\nNow, let's list each column:\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow1: -12\n\nRow2: 35\n\nRow3: -12\n\nRow4: -49\n\nRow5: 35\n\nRow6: 35\n\nRow7: -49\n\nRow8: 0\n\nRow9: 35\n\nRow10: -12\n\nSum: -12+35=23; 23-12=11; 11-49=-38; -38+35=-3; -3+35=32; 32-49=-17; -17+0=-17; -17+35=18; 18-12=6. Correct.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow1: 0\n\nRow2: -12\n\nRow3: -49\n\nRow4: 35\n\nRow5: -49\n\nRow6: -12\n\nRow7: 0\n\nRow8: 35\n\nRow9: 35\n\nRow10: 35\n\nSum: 0-12=-12; -12-49=-61; -61+35=-26; -26-49=-75; -75-12=-87; -87+0=-87; -87+35=-52; -52+35=-17; -17+35=18. Correct.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow1: -12\n\nRow2: -12\n\nRow3: 0\n\nRow4: 35\n\nRow5: -49\n\nRow6: 0\n\nRow7: 35\n\nRow8: -49\n\nRow9: -49\n\nRow10: 0\n\nSum: -12-12=-24; -24+0=-24; -24+35=11; 11-49=-38; -38+0=-38; -38+35=-3; -3-49=-52; -52-49=-101; -101+0=-101. Correct.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow1: -49\n\nRow2: -49\n\nRow3: -49\n\nRow4: -49\n\nRow5: 35\n\nRow6: 35\n\nRow7: 0\n\nRow8: 35\n\nRow9: 35\n\nRow10: -49\n\nSum: -49*4= -196; -196+35= -161; -161+35= -126; -126+0= -126; -126+35= -91; -91+35= -56; -56 + (-49)= -105? Wait, no, let's do it step by step:\n\nRow1: -49\n\nRow2: -49 → -98\n\nRow3: -49 → -147\n\nRow4: -49 → -196\n\nRow5: +35 → -161\n\nRow6: +35 → -126\n\nRow7: +0 → -126\n\nRow8: +35 → -91\n\nRow9: +35 → -56\n\nRow10: -49 → -56 -49 = -105. Wait, this is different from before! Earlier I calculated column4 sum as -189, but now I'm getting -105. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, this is a critical mistake. Earlier I thought row8's column4 is -49, but looking at the grid for row8:\n\nRow8: ↑→♦→♦ → symbols are B, C, D, C, D. So column4 is C, which is 35. So row8's column4 is 35, not -49. Earlier when I was calculating column4 sum, I mistakenly included row8 as -49, but it's actually 35. That's where the error was!\n\nLet me correct that.\n\nLet me re-calculate column4:\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow1: -49\n\nRow2: -49 → -98\n\nRow3: -49 → -147\n\nRow4: -49 → -196\n\nRow5: 35 → -161\n\nRow6: 35 → -126\n\nRow7: 0 → -126\n\nRow8: 35 → -91\n\nRow9: 35 → -56\n\nRow10: -49 → -56 -49 = -105.\n\nSo column4 sum is -105, not -189 as I previously thought. This explains the discrepancy! Earlier I incorrectly assumed row8's column4 was D (-49), but it's actually C (35). Let me verify the symbols for row8.\n\nRow8: ↑→♦→♦ → symbols are B, C, D, C, D. So the fourth element is C, which is 35. So in column4 for row8, it's 35, not D. I must have made a mistake in the earlier calculation of column4. Previously, I thought row8's column4 was D, but it's C. That's the error.\n\nSo column4 sum is -105, not -189. Let me recalculate column4 sum correctly.\n\nSo the correct column4 sum is -105.\n\nLet me recheck column4:\n\nNumbers: -49 (row1), -49 (row2), -49 (row3), -49 (row4), 35 (row5), 35 (row6), 0 (row7), 35 (row8), 35 (row9), -49 (row10).\n\nAdding them:\n\n-49 *4 = -196 (rows1-4)\n\n+35 (row5) → -161\n\n+35 (row6) → -126\n\n+0 (row7) → -126\n\n+35 (row8) → -91\n\n+35 (row9) → -56\n\n+ (-49) (row10) → -56 -49 = -105.\n\nYes, column4 sum is -105.\n\nPreviously I had -189 because I incorrectly included row8 as D instead of C. That was the mistake.\n\nNow, let's recalculate the total of column sums:\n\nColumn1:6, column2:18, column3:-101, column4:-105, column5:-52.\n\nTotal: 6 +18 =24; 24-101=-77; -77-105=-182; -182-52=-234. Which matches the row sum total of -234. Great! Now the totals match.\n\nSo the correct column sums are:\n\n[6, 18, -101, -105, -52].\n\nLet me double-check column5 sum again. It was -52. Let me confirm.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow1: -12\n\nRow2: -12 → -24\n\nRow3: 0 → -24\n\nRow4: -49 → -73\n\nRow5: 35 → -38\n\nRow6: 0 → -38\n\nRow7: 0 → -38\n\nRow8: -49 → -87\n\nRow9: 35 → -52\n\nRow10: 0 → -52. Correct.\n\nNow, with the corrected column4 sum, the column sums are correct.\n\nSo the final answer is [6, 18, -101, -105, -52].\n\nLet me verify once more by recalculating column4.\n\nYes, as above, column4 is -105. So the correct column sums are as above.\n ;Answer: [6, 18, -101, -105, -52]"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the column sums based on the given grid and row sums. First, I need to understand the problem. Each symbol in the grid represents a numerical value. The rows are given with their total sums. My task is to calculate the sum for each column.\n\nHmm, so the grid has 8 rows and 8 columns each, I think. Let me check. Each row has eight symbols followed by a number which is the row's sum. For example, the first row is ⇔√⊙⇔→⊙≈⇔ and the sum is -407. So each row has 8 symbols, making 8 columns. Therefore, there are 8 columns in total. I need to find the sum of each column.\n\nThe challenge here is that each symbol has a specific value, but I don't know what each symbol is worth. However, since all rows and columns are made up of these symbols, maybe I can set up a system of equations to solve for each symbol's value first. Once I have the value of each symbol, I can compute the column sums.\n\nLet me list out all the symbols present. Looking at the grid:\n\nSymbols used are: ⇔, √, ⊙, →, ∆, ≈, ←, and maybe others? Let me check each row.\n\nFirst row: ⇔, √, ⊙, ⇔, →, ⊙, ≈, ⇔. So symbols here are ⇔, √, ⊙, →, ≈.\n\nSecond row: ⊙, ∆, →, √, ≈, √, ⇔, ≈. Symbols here include ∆.\n\nThird row: →, ←, ⊙, √, →, ←, →, ⊙. ← is new here.\n\nFourth row: ≈, ∆, ⊙, ←, ←, ⇔, ⊙, →. Also includes ← again.\n\nFifth row: √, ⇔, ⊙, √, √, ≈, ⇔, ←. \n\nSixth row: ≈, ⇔, ⇔, ≈, ≈, √, ⊙, ←. \n\nSeventh row: ⇔, ⇔, →, ∆, ≈, →, ≈, ⇔. \n\nEighth row: √, ∆, ⊙, ∆, ∆, ⇔, ∆, ⇔. \n\nSo compiling all symbols: ⇔, √, ⊙, →, ∆, ≈, ←. Wait, that's seven symbols. Wait, let me check again. The third row has ←, which is a new symbol. So total symbols are: ⇔, √, ⊙, →, ∆, ≈, ←. That's seven symbols. But each row has eight elements. So maybe there are more symbols? Or perhaps some symbols are repeated in the same row. Let me check again.\n\nWait, first row: eight symbols. Let me count the unique symbols in each row. For example, first row has ⇔, √, ⊙, →, ≈. Second row adds ∆. Third adds ←. Fourth has those. Fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth rows don't add new symbols beyond that. So total symbols are seven: ⇔, √, ⊙, →, ∆, ≈, ←. Wait, but each row has eight elements. So each row must have these symbols, possibly with some repeated. But since there are seven symbols, each row must have at least one repeated symbol. But how can we solve for seven variables (symbol values) given eight rows? Hmm, but maybe there are more symbols? Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the first row: symbols are ⇔, √, ⊙, ⇔, →, ⊙, ≈, ⇔. So symbols are ⇔, √, ⊙, →, ≈. Second row: ⊙, ∆, →, √, ≈, √, ⇔, ≈. So symbols here are ⊙, ∆, →, √, ≈, ⇔. Third row: →, ←, ⊙, √, →, ←, →, ⊙. So adds ←. Fourth row: ≈, ∆, ⊙, ←, ←, ⇔, ⊙, →. Same symbols. Fifth row: √, ⇔, ⊙, √, √, ≈, ⇔, ←. Adds ← again. Sixth row: ≈, ⇔, ⇔, ≈, ≈, √, ⊙, ←. Seventh row: ⇔, ⇔, →, ∆, ≈, →, ≈, ⇔. Eighth row: √, ∆, ⊙, ∆, ∆, ⇔, ∆, ⇔. \n\nSo total unique symbols are: ⇔, √, ⊙, →, ∆, ≈, ←. Seven symbols. But each row has eight elements. Therefore, each row must have one of the symbols repeated. But with seven symbols, how can we create eight elements per row? So each row must have at least one symbol appearing twice. Therefore, with seven variables (symbols) and eight equations (rows), we can solve for the variables. Let me proceed.\n\nLet me assign variables to each symbol:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet A = ⇔\n\nB = √\n\nC = ⊙\n\nD = →\n\nE = ∆\n\nF = ≈\n\nG = ←\n\nSo each symbol is a variable. Now, each row's equation can be written as the sum of their symbols equal to the given row sum.\n\nLet me write equations for each row.\n\nRow 1: A, B, C, A, D, C, F, A → Sum: A + B + C + A + D + C + F + A = 3A + B + 2C + D + F = -407\n\nRow 2: C, E, D, B, F, B, A, F → C + E + D + B + F + B + A + F = A + B + C + D + E + 2F + 0? Wait, let me count:\n\nSymbols in row 2: ⊙ (C), ∆ (E), → (D), √ (B), ≈ (F), √ (B), ⇔ (A), ≈ (F). So sum is C + E + D + B + F + B + A + F = A + B*2 + C + D + E + F*2 = -200.\n\nRow 3: → (D), ← (G), ⊙ (C), √ (B), → (D), ← (G), → (D), ⊙ (C) → D + G + C + B + D + G + D + C = 3D + 2G + 2C + B = -216.\n\nRow 4: ≈ (F), ∆ (E), ⊙ (C), ← (G), ← (G), ⇔ (A), ⊙ (C), → (D) → F + E + C + G + G + A + C + D = A + D + E + 2C + 2G + F = -161.\n\nRow 5: √ (B), ⇔ (A), ⊙ (C), √ (B), √ (B), ≈ (F), ⇔ (A), ← (G) → B + A + C + B + B + F + A + G = 2A + 3B + C + F + G = -221.\n\nRow 6: ≈ (F), ⇔ (A), ⇔ (A), ≈ (F), ≈ (F), √ (B), ⊙ (C), ← (G) → F + A + A + F + F + B + C + G = 2A + 3F + B + C + G = -259.\n\nRow 7: ⇔ (A), ⇔ (A), → (D), ∆ (E), ≈ (F), → (D), ≈ (F), ⇔ (A) → A + A + D + E + F + D + F + A = 3A + 2D + E + 2F = -292.\n\nRow 8: √ (B), ∆ (E), ⊙ (C), ∆ (E), ∆ (E), ⇔ (A), ∆ (E), ⇔ (A) → B + E + C + E + E + A + E + A = 2A + B + C + 4E = -8.\n\nSo now we have eight equations with seven variables. Wait, but there are seven variables (A, B, C, D, E, F, G). Let me count again:\n\nVariables are A (⇔), B (√), C (⊙), D (→), E (∆), F (≈), G (←). So seven variables. Eight equations. So the system is overdetermined. But perhaps there is a solution that satisfies all equations. Let me proceed to solve these equations.\n\nLet me write all equations:\n\nEquation 1: 3A + B + 2C + D + F = -407\n\nEquation 2: A + 2B + C + D + E + 2F = -200\n\nEquation 3: 3D + 2G + 2C + B = -216\n\nEquation 4: A + D + E + 2C + 2G + F = -161\n\nEquation 5: 2A + 3B + C + F + G = -221\n\nEquation 6: 2A + B + C + G + 3F = -259\n\nEquation 7: 3A + 2D + E + 2F = -292\n\nEquation 8: 2A + B + C + 4E = -8\n\nSo seven variables and eight equations. Let me see if we can solve this system. Let me try to express variables step by step.\n\nFirst, perhaps I can find equations that can be combined. Let's look for equations that can be solved step by step.\n\nLet me start with Equation 8: 2A + B + C + 4E = -8. Let's note that.\n\nEquation 7: 3A + 2D + E + 2F = -292.\n\nEquation 2: A + 2B + C + D + E + 2F = -200.\n\nEquation 1: 3A + B + 2C + D + F = -407.\n\nEquation 3: 3D + 2G + 2C + B = -216.\n\nEquation 4: A + D + E + 2C + 2G + F = -161.\n\nEquation 5: 2A + 3B + C + F + G = -221.\n\nEquation 6: 2A + B + C + G + 3F = -259.\n\nThis seems complex, but maybe we can find substitutions. Let me see if I can find some relations.\n\nLet me note that Equations 5 and 6 both have 2A + B + C + G. Let me subtract them or combine them.\n\nEquation 5: 2A + 3B + C + F + G = -221.\n\nEquation 6: 2A + B + C + G + 3F = -259.\n\nSubtract Equation 6 from Equation 5:\n\n(2A - 2A) + (3B - B) + (C - C) + (F - 3F) + (G - G) = -221 - (-259)\n\nWhich is 2B - 2F = 38 → 2B - 2F = 38 → B - F = 19 → B = F + 19. Let me note this as Equation 9: B = F + 19.\n\nThat's helpful. Let me keep that.\n\nNow, looking at Equation 8: 2A + B + C + 4E = -8. Maybe we can find another equation involving E.\n\nEquation 7: 3A + 2D + E + 2F = -292. Let's keep that.\n\nEquation 2: A + 2B + C + D + E + 2F = -200.\n\nEquation 4: A + D + E + 2C + 2G + F = -161.\n\nEquation 3: 3D + 2G + 2C + B = -216.\n\nEquation 1: 3A + B + 2C + D + F = -407.\n\nLet me see if I can express variables in terms of others. Let me try to find expressions for D and G.\n\nFrom Equation 3: 3D + 2G + 2C + B = -216. Let's solve for 2G:\n\n2G = -216 - 3D - 2C - B → G = (-216 - 3D - 2C - B)/2. Let's note this as Equation 10.\n\nFrom Equation 4: A + D + E + 2C + 2G + F = -161. Let's substitute G from Equation 10 into this.\n\nSo Equation 4 becomes:\n\nA + D + E + 2C + 2*[(-216 - 3D - 2C - B)/2] + F = -161.\n\nSimplify:\n\nA + D + E + 2C + (-216 - 3D - 2C - B) + F = -161.\n\nSimplify terms:\n\nA + D + E + 2C -216 -3D -2C - B + F = -161.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nA + (D -3D) + E + (2C -2C) - B -216 + F = -161 → A - 2D + E - B + F -216 = -161.\n\nRearranged: A - 2D + E - B + F = -161 + 216 = 55 → Equation 11: A - 2D + E - B + F = 55.\n\nNow, using Equation 9 (B = F +19), substitute B in Equation 11:\n\nA - 2D + E - (F +19) + F = 55 → A - 2D + E - F -19 + F = 55 → A - 2D + E -19 = 55 → A - 2D + E = 74. Let's call this Equation 12.\n\nNow, let's look at Equation 7: 3A + 2D + E + 2F = -292. Let's note that.\n\nAlso, Equation 2: A + 2B + C + D + E + 2F = -200. Let's substitute B with F +19 here.\n\nEquation 2 becomes:\n\nA + 2(F +19) + C + D + E + 2F = -200 → A + 2F + 38 + C + D + E + 2F = -200 → A + C + D + E + 4F +38 = -200 → A + C + D + E +4F = -238. Let's call this Equation 13.\n\nNow, Equation 1: 3A + B + 2C + D + F = -407. Substitute B with F +19:\n\n3A + (F +19) + 2C + D + F = -407 → 3A + 2F +19 + 2C + D = -407 → 3A + D + 2C + 2F = -426. Let's call this Equation 14.\n\nEquation 8: 2A + B + C +4E = -8. Substitute B = F +19:\n\n2A + (F +19) + C +4E = -8 → 2A + F +19 + C +4E = -8 → 2A + C + F +4E = -27. Let's call this Equation 15.\n\nNow, let's see what equations we have so far:\n\nEquation 12: A - 2D + E = 74.\n\nEquation 13: A + C + D + E +4F = -238.\n\nEquation 14: 3A + D + 2C + 2F = -426.\n\nEquation 15: 2A + C + F +4E = -27.\n\nEquation 7: 3A + 2D + E + 2F = -292.\n\nLet me see if I can find relations between these equations. Let me try to express variables in terms of others.\n\nFirst, perhaps from Equation 12: A -2D + E =74 → E = 74 -A +2D. Let me call this Equation 16.\n\nNow substitute E into Equation 7: 3A + 2D + (74 -A +2D) + 2F = -292.\n\nSimplify:\n\n3A + 2D +74 -A +2D +2F = -292 → 2A +4D +2F +74 = -292 → 2A +4D +2F = -366 → Divide both sides by 2: A +2D +F = -183. Let's call this Equation 17.\n\nEquation 17: A +2D +F = -183.\n\nNow, Equation 13: A + C + D + E +4F = -238. Substitute E from Equation 16:\n\nA + C + D + (74 -A +2D) +4F = -238 → A + C + D +74 -A +2D +4F = -238 → C +3D +4F +74 = -238 → C +3D +4F = -312. Let's call this Equation 18.\n\nEquation 14: 3A + D + 2C + 2F = -426.\n\nEquation 15: 2A + C + F +4E = -27. Substitute E from Equation 16 into this:\n\n2A + C + F +4*(74 -A +2D) = -27 → 2A + C + F + 296 -4A +8D = -27 → (-2A) + C + F +8D +296 = -27 → -2A + C + F +8D = -323. Let's call this Equation 19.\n\nNow, let's summarize the equations we have:\n\nEquation 17: A +2D +F = -183.\n\nEquation 18: C +3D +4F = -312.\n\nEquation 14: 3A + D + 2C + 2F = -426.\n\nEquation 19: -2A + C + F +8D = -323.\n\nLet me see if I can solve these equations. Let me try to express variables in terms of others.\n\nFrom Equation 17: A = -183 -2D -F. Let's call this Equation 20.\n\nNow substitute Equation 20 into Equation 19 and others.\n\nFirst, Equation 19: -2A + C + F +8D = -323. Substitute A from Equation 20:\n\n-2*(-183 -2D -F) + C + F +8D = -323 → 366 +4D +2F + C +F +8D = -323 → 366 + C +12D +3F = -323 → C +12D +3F = -323 -366 = -689. Let's call this Equation 21.\n\nEquation 18: C +3D +4F = -312. Let's call this Equation 18 again.\n\nNow, subtract Equation 18 from Equation 21:\n\n(C +12D +3F) - (C +3D +4F) = -689 - (-312) → 9D -F = -377 → 9D -F = -377 → F = 9D +377. Let me call this Equation 22.\n\nNow, from Equation 22: F = 9D +377.\n\nNow, substitute F into Equation 20 (A = -183 -2D -F):\n\nA = -183 -2D - (9D +377) = -183 -2D -9D -377 = -183 -377 -11D = -560 -11D. Equation 23.\n\nNow, let's substitute F and A into Equation 14: 3A + D + 2C + 2F = -426.\n\nSubstituting A from Equation 23 and F from Equation 22:\n\n3*(-560 -11D) + D + 2C + 2*(9D +377) = -426.\n\nCalculate:\n\n-1680 -33D + D + 2C +18D +754 = -426.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-1680 +754) + (-33D + D +18D) + 2C = -426.\n\nCalculating:\n\n-926 -14D + 2C = -426 → 2C -14D = -426 +926 = 500 → 2C = 14D +500 → C =7D +250. Equation 24.\n\nNow, Equation 18: C +3D +4F = -312. Substitute C and F from Equations 24 and 22:\n\n(7D +250) +3D +4*(9D +377) = -312.\n\nCalculate:\n\n7D +250 +3D +36D + 1508 = -312 → (7D +3D +36D) + (250 +1508) = -312 → 46D +1758 = -312 → 46D = -312 -1758 = -2070 → D = -2070 /46 = -45. Let me check that division: 46*45 = 2070. So D = -45.\n\nNow that we have D = -45, let's compute other variables.\n\nFrom Equation 22: F = 9D +377 = 9*(-45) +377 = -405 +377 = -28.\n\nFrom Equation 23: A = -560 -11D = -560 -11*(-45) = -560 +495 = -65.\n\nFrom Equation 24: C =7D +250 =7*(-45) +250 = -315 +250 = -65.\n\nNow, from Equation 18: C +3D +4F = -312. Let's check if this holds with D=-45, C=-65, F=-28.\n\nC +3D +4F = -65 +3*(-45) +4*(-28) = -65 -135 -112 = -65 -247 = -312. Correct.\n\nNow, moving on. Let's compute B from Equation 9: B = F +19 = -28 +19 = -9.\n\nNow, we have A=-65, B=-9, C=-65, D=-45, F=-28.\n\nNow, need to find E and G.\n\nFrom Equation 16: E =74 -A +2D. Substitute A=-65, D=-45:\n\nE =74 -(-65) +2*(-45) =74 +65 -90 = 139 -90 =49.\n\nNow, E=49.\n\nCheck Equation 8: 2A + B + C +4E = -8. Let's see:\n\n2*(-65) + (-9) + (-65) +4*49 = -130 -9 -65 +196 = (-204) +196 = -8. Correct.\n\nNow, need to find G. Let's use Equation 10: G = (-216 -3D -2C - B)/2.\n\nSubstituting D=-45, C=-65, B=-9:\n\nG = (-216 -3*(-45) -2*(-65) - (-9))/2 = (-216 +135 +130 +9)/2 = (-216 + 274)/2 = 58/2 =29. So G=29.\n\nLet me verify with another equation. For example, Equation 3: 3D + 2G + 2C + B = -216.\n\nSubstituting D=-45, G=29, C=-65, B=-9:\n\n3*(-45) + 2*29 + 2*(-65) + (-9) = -135 +58 -130 -9 = (-135 -130 -9) +58 = (-274) +58 = -216. Correct.\n\nNow, let's check Equation 4: A + D + E + 2C + 2G + F = -161.\n\nA=-65, D=-45, E=49, C=-65, G=29, F=-28.\n\nSo sum is -65 + (-45) +49 +2*(-65) +2*29 + (-28) = -65-45+49-130+58-28.\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\nStart with -65-45 = -110. +49 → -61. -130 → -191. +58 → -133. -28 → -161. Correct.\n\nNow, let's check Equation 5: 2A +3B + C + F + G = -221.\n\n2*(-65) +3*(-9) + (-65) + (-28) +29 = -130 -27 -65 -28 +29 = (-130-27= -157; -157-65= -222; -222-28= -250; -250+29= -221). Correct.\n\nEquation 6: 2A + B + C + G + 3F = -259.\n\n2*(-65) + (-9) + (-65) +29 +3*(-28) = -130 -9 -65 +29 -84 = (-130-9= -139; -139-65= -204; -204+29= -175; -175-84= -259). Correct.\n\nEquation 7: 3A + 2D + E + 2F = -292.\n\n3*(-65) +2*(-45) +49 +2*(-28) = -195 -90 +49 -56 = (-195-90= -285; -285+49= -236; -236-56= -292). Correct.\n\nEquation 2: After substitution, we had Equation 13 which was checked earlier. All seems correct.\n\nSo now, we have all variables:\n\nA (⇔) = -65\n\nB (√) = -9\n\nC (⊙) = -65\n\nD (→) = -45\n\nE (∆) = 49\n\nF (≈) = -28\n\nG (←) = 29\n\nNow, with these values, we can compute the column sums. Each column is the sum of the symbols in that column across all 8 rows.\n\nSo there are 8 columns. Let me list each column's symbols across the 8 rows and compute their sum.\n\nLet me first write down the grid again, column by column.\n\nOriginal grid rows:\n\nRow 1: ⇔ √ ⊙ ⇔ → ⊙ ≈ ⇔ → A B C A D C F A\n\nRow 2: ⊙ ∆ → √ ≈ √ ⇔ ≈ → C E D B F B A F\n\nRow 3: → ← ⊙ √ → ← → ⊙ → D G C B D G D C\n\nRow 4: ≈ ∆ ⊙ ← ← ⇔ ⊙ → → F E C G G A C D\n\nRow 5: √ ⇔ ⊙ √ √ ≈ ⇔ ← → B A C B B F A G\n\nRow 6: ≈ ⇔ ⇔ ≈ ≈ √ ⊙ ← → F A A F F B C G\n\nRow 7: ⇔ ⇔ → ∆ ≈ → ≈ ⇔ → A A D E F D F A\n\nRow 8: √ ∆ ⊙ ∆ ∆ ⇔ ∆ ⇔ → B E C E E A E A\n\nNow, let me extract each column (columns 1 to 8):\n\nColumn 1: Row1: A; Row2: C; Row3: D; Row4: F; Row5: B; Row6: F; Row7: A; Row8: B.\n\nSo column 1 symbols: A, C, D, F, B, F, A, B.\n\nSum: A + C + D + F + B + F + A + B = 2A + 2B + C + D + 2F.\n\nColumn 2: Row1: B; Row2: E; Row3: G; Row4: E; Row5: A; Row6: A; Row7: A; Row8: E.\n\nSymbols: B, E, G, E, A, A, A, E. Sum: 3A + 2E + 2B + G.\n\nColumn 3: Row1: C; Row2: D; Row3: C; Row4: C; Row5: C; Row6: C; Row7: D; Row8: C.\n\nSymbols: C, D, C, C, C, C, D, C → 6C + 2D.\n\nColumn 4: Row1: A; Row2: B; Row3: B; Row4: G; Row5: B; Row6: F; Row7: E; Row8: E.\n\nSymbols: A, B, B, G, B, F, E, E. Sum: A + 3B + F + 2E + G.\n\nColumn 5: Row1: D; Row2: F; Row3: D; Row4: G; Row5: B; Row6: F; Row7: F; Row8: E.\n\nSymbols: D, F, D, G, B, F, F, E. Sum: 2D + 3F + B + G + E.\n\nColumn 6: Row1: C; Row2: B; Row3: G; Row4: A; Row5: F; Row6: B; Row7: D; Row8: A.\n\nSymbols: C, B, G, A, F, B, D, A. Sum: 2A + 2B + C + D + F + G.\n\nColumn 7: Row1: F; Row2: A; Row3: D; Row4: C; Row5: A; Row6: C; Row7: F; Row8: E.\n\nSymbols: F, A, D, C, A, C, F, E. Sum: 2A + 2C + 2F + D + E.\n\nColumn 8: Row1: A; Row2: F; Row3: C; Row4: D; Row5: G; Row6: G; Row7: A; Row8: A.\n\nSymbols: A, F, C, D, G, G, A, A. Sum: 3A + F + C + D + 2G.\n\nNow, let me compute each column's sum using the values:\n\nA=-65, B=-9, C=-65, D=-45, E=49, F=-28, G=29.\n\nLet's compute each column:\n\nColumn 1: 2A + 2B + C + D + 2F\n\n= 2*(-65) + 2*(-9) + (-65) + (-45) + 2*(-28)\n\n= -130 -18 -65 -45 -56 = (-130-18= -148; -148-65= -213; -213-45= -258; -258-56= -314)\n\nColumn 1 sum: -314.\n\nColumn 2: 3A + 2E + 2B + G\n\n= 3*(-65) + 2*49 + 2*(-9) +29\n\n= -195 +98 -18 +29 = (-195) + (98-18+29) = -195 + 109 = -86.\n\nColumn 2 sum: -86.\n\nColumn 3: 6C + 2D\n\n=6*(-65) +2*(-45) = -390 -90 = -480.\n\nColumn 3 sum: -480.\n\nColumn 4: A + 3B + F + 2E + G\n\n= (-65) + 3*(-9) + (-28) + 2*49 +29 \n\n= -65 -27 -28 +98 +29 \n\nCalculate step by step:\n\n-65 -27 = -92; -92 -28 = -120; -120 +98 = -22; -22 +29 = 7.\n\nColumn 4 sum: 7.\n\nColumn 5: 2D + 3F + B + G + E\n\n= 2*(-45) + 3*(-28) + (-9) +29 +49 \n\n= -90 -84 -9 +29 +49 \n\n= (-90-84= -174; -174-9= -183; -183+29= -154; -154+49= -105).\n\nColumn 5 sum: -105.\n\nColumn 6: 2A + 2B + C + D + F + G \n\n= 2*(-65) + 2*(-9) + (-65) + (-45) + (-28) +29 \n\n= -130 -18 -65 -45 -28 +29 \n\n= (-130-18= -148; -148-65= -213; -213-45= -258; -258-28= -286; -286+29= -257).\n\nColumn 6 sum: -257.\n\nColumn 7: 2A + 2C + 2F + D + E \n\n= 2*(-65) + 2*(-65) + 2*(-28) + (-45) +49 \n\n= -130 -130 -56 -45 +49 \n\n= (-130-130= -260; -260-56= -316; -316-45= -361; -361+49= -312).\n\nColumn 7 sum: -312.\n\nColumn 8: 3A + F + C + D + 2G \n\n= 3*(-65) + (-28) + (-65) + (-45) + 2*29 \n\n= -195 -28 -65 -45 +58 \n\n= (-195-28= -223; -223-65= -288; -288-45= -333; -333+58= -275).\n\nColumn 8 sum: -275.\n\nLet me check if these column sums make sense. Also, let me verify with one of the columns using another approach. For example, column 1: sum of all elements in column 1 across all rows. Let me check with actual values.\n\nColumn 1 symbols across rows:\n\nRow1: A=-65\n\nRow2: C=-65\n\nRow3: D=-45\n\nRow4: F=-28\n\nRow5: B=-9\n\nRow6: F=-28\n\nRow7: A=-65\n\nRow8: B=-9\n\nSum: -65 -65 -45 -28 -9 -28 -65 -9 \n\nLet me calculate:\n\nStart adding:\n\n-65 -65 = -130\n\n-130 -45 = -175\n\n-175 -28 = -203\n\n-203 -9 = -212\n\n-212 -28 = -240\n\n-240 -65 = -305\n\n-305 -9 = -314. Correct. So column 1 is indeed -314.\n\nAnother check: column 4 sum was calculated as 7. Let's verify:\n\nSymbols: A=-65, B=-9 (three times), F=-28, E=49 (twice), G=29.\n\nSo symbols in column 4:\n\nRow1: B=-9\n\nRow2: B=-9\n\nRow3: B=-9\n\nRow4: G=29\n\nRow5: B=-9\n\nRow6: F=-28\n\nRow7: E=49\n\nRow8: E=49.\n\nWait, no, column 4 symbols are:\n\nFrom earlier list:\n\nColumn 4: A, B, B, G, B, F, E, E. Wait, the symbols are A (Row1), B (Row2?), let me recheck:\n\nEarlier for column 4:\n\nRow1: A (Row1: column 4 is A)\n\nRow2: B (Row2: column 4 is B)\n\nRow3: B (Row3: column 4 is B)\n\nRow4: G (Row4: column 4 is G)\n\nRow5: B (Row5: column 4 is B)\n\nRow6: F (Row6: column 4 is F)\n\nRow7: E (Row7: column 4 is E)\n\nRow8: E (Row8: column 4 is E).\n\nSo sum is:\n\nA (-65) + B (-9) + B (-9) + G (29) + B (-9) + F (-28) + E (49) + E (49) \n\nCalculating:\n\n-65 -9 -9 +29 -9 -28 +49 +49 \n\n= (-65 -9 -9 -9 -28) + (29 +49 +49)\n\n= (-65 -36 -28) + 127 \n\n= (-129) + 127 = -2. Wait, this contradicts earlier calculation of 7. Wait, what's wrong here?\n\nWait, earlier when calculating column 4 sum, I had:\n\nColumn 4: A + 3B + F + 2E + G. Wait, let me check the symbols again.\n\nSymbols in column 4 are:\n\nRow1: A\n\nRow2: B\n\nRow3: B\n\nRow4: G\n\nRow5: B\n\nRow6: F\n\nRow7: E\n\nRow8: E.\n\nSo that's A (1), B (3 times?), no: rows 1,2,3,5: four B? Wait no:\n\nRow1: A (1)\n\nRow2: B (2)\n\nRow3: B (3)\n\nRow4: G (4)\n\nRow5: B (5)\n\nRow6: F (6)\n\nRow7: E (7)\n\nRow8: E (8)\n\nSo symbols are A, B, B, G, B, F, E, E. So that's 1 A, 3 B, 1 G, 1 F, 2 E.\n\nSo the sum is A + 3B + G + F + 2E.\n\nEarlier, I had written the sum as A + 3B + F + 2E + G. Which is the same thing. So the calculation was:\n\nA + 3B + F + 2E + G = (-65) + 3*(-9) + (-28) + 2*49 +29 \n\n= -65 -27 -28 +98 +29 \n\n= -65-27= -92; -92-28= -120; -120+98= -22; -22+29= 7. \n\nBut when I added manually, I got -2. Where is the mistake?\n\nWait let me re-calculate manually:\n\nA is -65.\n\nB (Row2): -9.\n\nB (Row3): -9.\n\nG (Row4): +29.\n\nB (Row5): -9.\n\nF (Row6): -28.\n\nE (Row7): +49.\n\nE (Row8): +49.\n\nSo adding step by step:\n\nStart with 0.\n\nAdd -65: -65.\n\nAdd -9: -74.\n\nAdd -9: -83.\n\nAdd +29: -54.\n\nAdd -9: -63.\n\nAdd -28: -91.\n\nAdd +49: -42.\n\nAdd +49: +7. \n\nAh! I must have made a mistake earlier when I did it manually. The correct sum is indeed 7. My previous manual calculation had an error in the steps. So column 4 sum is 7. Correct.\n\nAnother check: column 5 sum was calculated as -105. Let me check:\n\nSymbols in column 5: D, F, D, G, B, F, F, E.\n\nValues: D=-45, F=-28, D=-45, G=29, B=-9, F=-28, F=-28, E=49.\n\nSum: -45 -28 -45 +29 -9 -28 -28 +49.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nStart with -45 -28 = -73.\n\n-73 -45 = -118.\n\n-118 +29 = -89.\n\n-89 -9 = -98.\n\n-98 -28 = -126.\n\n-126 -28 = -154.\n\n-154 +49 = -105. Correct.\n\nSo all columns seem to be correct.\n\nTherefore, the column sums are:\n\nColumn 1: -314\n\nColumn 2: -86\n\nColumn 3: -480\n\nColumn 4: 7\n\nColumn 5: -105\n\nColumn 6: -257\n\nColumn 7: -312\n\nColumn 8: -275\n\nSo the answer should be the list of these sums in order.\n ;Answer: [-314,-86,-480,7,-105,-257,-312,-275]"

      "Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have a grid with symbols in each row, and each row has a sum provided. Our task is to find the sum of each column and output that as a list. The tricky part is that each symbol represents a numerical value, but we don't know what those values are yet. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grid. Let me look at the given data again. Each line represents a row of symbols followed by the sum of that row. For example, the first row is \"∀∉@∉∅∀ 160\", meaning the symbols are ∀, ∉, @, ∉, ∅, ∀ and their total sum is 160. Similarly for the other rows. There are six rows, each with six symbols, so the grid is 6x6. \n\nOur goal is to find the sum for each column. Since each column has six entries (one from each row), we need to add up the values of those symbols in each column. But since we don't know the individual symbol values, we need to find them first based on the row sums provided.\n\nThis seems like a system of equations problem. Each row gives an equation where the sum of the symbols in that row equals the given number. Since there are six rows and presumably six different symbols (though I need to check how many unique symbols there are), we can set up equations and solve for each symbol's value.\n\nLet me list out all the symbols first. Looking at the grid:\n\nThe symbols used are: ∀, ∉, @, ∅, #, and maybe others. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 1: ∀, ∉, @, ∉, ∅, ∀\nRow 2: ∅, #, @, ∅, @, ∅\nRow 3: ∉, ∉, #, ∀, ∀, @\nRow 4: ∅, ∅, ∅, @, ∉, ∅\nRow 5: ∉, ∉, ∀, #, ∉, ∅\nRow 6: ∀, ∉, ∉, ∀, #, @\n\nSo the unique symbols are: ∀, ∉, @, ∅, #. Wait, that's five symbols. Wait, let me check again. Are there any others? The symbols are ∀, ∉, @, ∅, #. Yes, five symbols. So each symbol has a unique value. Let me denote them as variables:\n\nLet me assign variables:\n\nLet’s say:\nA = ∀\nB = ∉\nC = @\nD = ∅\nE = #\n\nSo each symbol corresponds to a variable. Now, each row can be written as an equation.\n\nLet me write equations for each row:\n\nRow 1: A + B + C + B + D + A = 160 → 2A + 2B + C + D = 160 (Equation 1)\n\nRow 2: D + E + C + D + C + D = -392 → 3D + E + 2C = -392 (Equation 2)\n\nRow 3: B + B + E + A + A + C = 228 → 2A + 2B + E + C = 228 (Equation 3)\n\nRow 4: D + D + D + C + B + D = -324 → 4D + C + B = -324 (Equation 4)\n\nRow 5: B + B + A + E + B + D = 195 → A + 3B + E + D = 195 (Equation 5)\n\nRow 6: A + B + B + A + E + C = 228 → 2A + 2B + E + C = 228 (Equation 6)\n\nWait, Equation 3 and Equation 6 look the same. Let me check:\n\nRow 3: symbols are ∉, ∉, #, ∀, ∀, @ → B, B, E, A, A, C → sum is 2A + 2B + E + C = 228. Correct.\n\nRow 6: symbols are ∀, ∉, ∉, ∀, #, @ → A, B, B, A, E, C → sum is 2A + 2B + E + C = 228. Yes, same as Equation 3. So Equations 3 and 6 are the same. That means we have five equations with five variables. Let me list the equations again:\n\nEquation 1: 2A + 2B + C + D = 160  \nEquation 2: 3D + E + 2C = -392  \nEquation 3: 2A + 2B + E + C = 228  \nEquation 4: 4D + C + B = -324  \nEquation 5: A + 3B + E + D = 195  \n\nSo five equations with five variables (A, B, C, D, E). Let's try to solve this system.\n\nFirst, perhaps we can find relationships between equations. Let me see:\n\nFrom Equation 1 and Equation 3. Let me subtract Equation 1 from Equation 3:\n\nEquation 3 - Equation 1:\n\n(2A + 2B + E + C) - (2A + 2B + C + D) = 228 - 160  \nThis simplifies to E - D = 68 → E = D + 68. (Equation 7)\n\nThat's helpful. Now we can substitute E in terms of D in other equations.\n\nLet me substitute Equation 7 into Equations 2, 5.\n\nEquation 2: 3D + E + 2C = -392 → 3D + (D + 68) + 2C = -392 → 4D + 68 + 2C = -392 → 4D + 2C = -460 → 2D + C = -230. (Equation 2a)\n\nEquation 5: A + 3B + E + D = 195 → A + 3B + (D + 68) + D = 195 → A + 3B + 2D + 68 = 195 → A + 3B + 2D = 127. (Equation 5a)\n\nEquation 4: 4D + C + B = -324. Let's note that.\n\nNow, Equation 2a is 2D + C = -230 → C = -230 - 2D. Let me call this Equation 2b.\n\nNow, substitute Equation 2b into Equation 4:\n\nEquation 4: 4D + C + B = -324 → 4D + (-230 - 2D) + B = -324 → 2D -230 + B = -324 → 2D + B = -94 → B = -94 - 2D. (Equation 4a)\n\nNow, let's look at Equation 1: 2A + 2B + C + D = 160. Let's substitute C from Equation 2b and B from Equation 4a.\n\nSo:\n\nC = -230 - 2D  \nB = -94 - 2D\n\nSubstituting into Equation 1:\n\n2A + 2*(-94 - 2D) + (-230 - 2D) + D = 160  \nLet me compute each term:\n\n2A + (-188 -4D) + (-230 -2D) + D = 160  \nCombine like terms:\n\n2A -188 -230 -4D -2D + D = 160  \n2A - 418 -5D = 160  \nThen:\n\n2A = 160 + 418 + 5D  \n2A = 578 + 5D  \nA = (578 + 5D)/2 → Equation 1a\n\nNow, let's look at Equation 5a: A + 3B + 2D = 127. Let's substitute A from Equation 1a and B from Equation 4a.\n\nA = (578 +5D)/2  \nB = -94 -2D\n\nSo:\n\n(578 +5D)/2 + 3*(-94 -2D) + 2D = 127  \nLet me compute each part:\n\nFirst term: (578 +5D)/2  \nSecond term: 3*(-94) = -282; 3*(-2D) = -6D → total -282 -6D  \nThird term: +2D\n\nSo combining:\n\n(578 +5D)/2 -282 -6D + 2D = 127  \nSimplify the D terms: -6D +2D = -4D\n\nSo:\n\n(578 +5D)/2 -282 -4D = 127\n\nLet me multiply all terms by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n578 +5D - 564 -8D = 254  \nWait, 282*2 is 564. Let me check:\n\nOriginal equation after multiplying by 2:\n\n578 +5D - 2*282 - 8D = 2*127  \nWait, 2*( (578 +5D)/2 -282 -4D ) = 2*127 → 578 +5D -564 -8D = 254  \nYes. Now compute:\n\n578 - 564 = 14  \n5D -8D = -3D  \nSo 14 -3D = 254  \nThen:\n\n-3D = 254 -14 → -3D = 240 → D = -80\n\nSo D = -80. Now we can find other variables.\n\nFrom Equation 7: E = D + 68 → E = -80 +68 = -12. So E = -12.\n\nFrom Equation 2b: C = -230 -2D → C = -230 -2*(-80) = -230 +160 = -70. So C = -70.\n\nFrom Equation 4a: B = -94 -2D → B = -94 -2*(-80) = -94 +160 = 66. So B = 66.\n\nFrom Equation 1a: A = (578 +5D)/2 → D is -80, so 5D = -400 → 578 -400 = 178 → 178/2 = 89. So A = 89.\n\nNow, check if these values satisfy all equations.\n\nLet me verify Equation 1: 2A + 2B + C + D = 2*89 + 2*66 + (-70) + (-80) → 178 + 132 -70 -80 = 178+132=310; 310-70=240; 240-80=160. Correct.\n\nEquation 2: 3D + E + 2C = 3*(-80) + (-12) + 2*(-70) → -240 -12 -140 = -240-12= -252 -140= -392. Correct.\n\nEquation 3: 2A + 2B + E + C = 2*89 + 2*66 + (-12) + (-70) → 178 + 132 -12 -70 = 178+132=310; 310-12=298; 298-70=228. Correct.\n\nEquation 4: 4D + C + B = 4*(-80) + (-70) +66 → -320 -70 +66 = -320-70=-390 +66=-324. Correct.\n\nEquation 5: A + 3B + E + D = 89 + 3*66 + (-12) + (-80) → 89 + 198 -12 -80. 89+198=287; 287-12=275; 275-80=195. Correct.\n\nEquation 6 is same as Equation 3, so it's also satisfied.\n\nGreat! So the values are:\n\nA (∀) = 89  \nB (∉) = 66  \nC (@) = -70  \nD (∅) = -80  \nE (#) = -12  \n\nNow, with these values, we can compute the column sums. The grid has six columns. Let me reconstruct the grid column by column.\n\nOriginal grid rows:\n\nRow 1: ∀ ∉ @ ∉ ∅ ∀ → Columns 1 to 6: [A, B, C, B, D, A]\nRow 2: ∅ # @ ∅ @ ∅ → [D, E, C, D, C, D]\nRow 3: ∉ ∉ # ∀ ∀ @ → [B, B, E, A, A, C]\nRow 4: ∅ ∅ ∅ @ ∉ ∅ → [D, D, D, C, B, D]\nRow 5: ∉ ∉ ∀ # ∉ ∅ → [B, B, A, E, B, D]\nRow 6: ∀ ∉ ∉ ∀ # @ → [A, B, B, A, E, C]\n\nNow, for each column (from 1 to 6), we need to sum the values in each row's corresponding position.\n\nLet me process each column one by one.\n\nColumn 1: positions (row1-col1, row2-col1, etc.)\n\nRow1: A (89)\nRow2: D (-80)\nRow3: B (66)\nRow4: D (-80)\nRow5: B (66)\nRow6: A (89)\n\nSum Column 1: 89 + (-80) + 66 + (-80) + 66 + 89. Let's compute:\n\n89 -80 = 9; 9 +66=75; 75-80= -5; -5 +66=61; 61 +89= 150. So Column 1 sum is 150.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow1: B (66)\nRow2: E (-12)\nRow3: B (66)\nRow4: D (-80)\nRow5: B (66)\nRow6: B (66)\n\nSum: 66 + (-12) +66 + (-80) +66 +66. Let's compute:\n\n66-12=54; 54+66=120; 120-80=40; 40+66=106; 106+66=172. Column 2 sum is 172.\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\nRow1: 66  \nRow2: -12 → 66-12=54  \nRow3: +66 → 54+66=120  \nRow4: -80 → 120-80=40  \nRow5: +66 → 40+66=106  \nRow6: +66 → 106+66=172. Yes, correct.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow1: C (-70)\nRow2: C (-70)\nRow3: E (-12)\nRow4: C (-70)\nRow5: A (89)\nRow6: B (66)\n\nSum: (-70) + (-70) + (-12) + (-70) +89 +66. Let's calculate:\n\n-70-70 = -140; -140-12=-152; -152-70=-222; -222+89=-133; -133+66=-67. Column 3 sum is -67.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nRow1: B (66)\nRow2: D (-80)\nRow3: A (89)\nRow4: C (-70)\nRow5: E (-12)\nRow6: A (89)\n\nSum: 66 + (-80) +89 + (-70) + (-12) +89. Let's compute:\n\n66-80= -14; -14+89=75; 75-70=5; 5-12=-7; -7+89=82. Column 4 sum is 82.\n\nColumn 5:\n\nRow1: D (-80)\nRow2: C (-70)\nRow3: A (89)\nRow4: B (66)\nRow5: B (66)\nRow6: E (-12)\n\nSum: -80 + (-70) +89 +66 +66 + (-12). Let's add:\n\n-80-70=-150; -150+89=-61; -61+66=5; 5+66=71; 71-12=59. Column 5 sum is 59.\n\nColumn 6:\n\nRow1: A (89)\nRow2: D (-80)\nRow3: C (-70)\nRow4: D (-80)\nRow5: D (-80)\nRow6: C (-70)\n\nSum: 89 + (-80) + (-70) + (-80) + (-80) + (-70). Let's compute:\n\n89-80=9; 9-70=-61; -61-80=-141; -141-80=-221; -221-70=-291. Column 6 sum is -291.\n\nSo compiling the column sums:\n\nColumn 1: 150  \nColumn 2: 172  \nColumn 3: -67  \nColumn 4: 82  \nColumn 5: 59  \nColumn 6: -291  \n\nTherefore, the final answer should be [150, 172, -67, 82, 59, -291].\n\nLet me cross-verify with the row sums. For example, the total sum of all rows should be equal to the total sum of all columns. Let's check:\n\nSum of row sums: 160 + (-392) + 228 + (-324) + 195 + 228.\n\nCalculating:\n\n160 -392 = -232  \n-232 + 228 = -4  \n-4 -324 = -328  \n-328 +195 = -133  \n-133 +228 = 95.\n\nSum of column sums: 150 +172 = 322; 322 -67=255; 255+82=337; 337+59=396; 396-291=105. Wait, this is 105. But the row sums total is 95. There's a discrepancy here. That suggests I made a mistake in calculation. Oh no! Where did I go wrong?\n\nHmm, this is a problem. The total of the row sums should equal the total of the column sums. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nFirst, let me recompute the row sum total:\n\nRow sums:\n\n160, -392, 228, -324, 195, 228.\n\nAdding step by step:\n\nStart with 160.\n\n160 + (-392) = -232.\n\n-232 + 228 = -4.\n\n-4 + (-324) = -328.\n\n-328 + 195 = -133.\n\n-133 + 228 = 95. Yes, total is 95.\n\nNow column sums as I calculated: 150 + 172 + (-67) +82 +59 + (-291) = ?\n\nLet me compute again:\n\n150 + 172 = 322  \n322 -67 = 255  \n255 +82 = 337  \n337 +59 = 396  \n396 -291 = 105. \n\nSo discrepancy of 10. That means I made an error in calculating the column sums. Let me check each column again.\n\nLet me re-calculate each column sum.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow1: 89  \nRow2: -80  \nRow3: 66  \nRow4: -80  \nRow5: 66  \nRow6: 89  \n\nSum: 89 -80 = 9; 9 +66=75; 75-80= -5; -5 +66=61; 61+89=150. Correct.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow1:66, Row2:-12, Row3:66, Row4:-80, Row5:66, Row6:66.\n\nSum: 66 -12 = 54; +66=120; -80=40; +66=106; +66=172. Correct.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow1:-70, Row2:-70, Row3:-12, Row4:-70, Row5:89, Row6:66.\n\nSum: -70 -70 = -140; -140 -12 = -152; -152 -70 = -222; -222 +89= -133; -133 +66= -67. Correct.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nRow1:66, Row2:-80, Row3:89, Row4:-70, Row5:-12, Row6:89.\n\nSum: 66 -80 = -14; -14 +89=75; 75 -70=5; 5 -12= -7; -7 +89=82. Correct.\n\nColumn 5:\n\nRow1:-80, Row2:-70, Row3:89, Row4:66, Row5:66, Row6:-12.\n\nSum: -80 -70 = -150; -150 +89= -61; -61 +66=5; 5 +66=71; 71 -12=59. Correct.\n\nColumn 6:\n\nRow1:89, Row2:-80, Row3:-70, Row4:-80, Row5:-80, Row6:-70.\n\nSum: 89 -80 = 9; 9 -70 = -61; -61 -80 = -141; -141 -80 = -221; -221 -70 = -291. Correct.\n\nSo column sums total to 150+172-67+82+59-291= 105. But row sums total is 95. Where is the mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the symbol assignments or in solving the equations. Let me check the equations again.\n\nLet me recheck the equations. Let me verify the equations again with the solved variables.\n\nA=89, B=66, C=-70, D=-80, E=-12.\n\nLet me check each row's sum:\n\nRow 1: 2A + 2B + C + D = 2*89 + 2*66 + (-70) + (-80) = 178 + 132 -70 -80 = 178+132=310; 310-70=240; 240-80=160. Correct.\n\nRow 2: 3D + E + 2C = 3*(-80) + (-12) + 2*(-70) = -240 -12 -140 = -392. Correct.\n\nRow 3: 2A + 2B + E + C = 2*89 + 2*66 + (-12) + (-70) = 178 + 132 -12 -70 = 178+132=310; 310-12=298; 298-70=228. Correct.\n\nRow 4: 4D + C + B = 4*(-80) + (-70) + 66 = -320 -70 +66 = -324. Correct.\n\nRow 5: A + 3B + E + D = 89 + 3*66 + (-12) + (-80) = 89 + 198 -12 -80 = 89+198=287; 287-12=275; 275-80=195. Correct.\n\nRow 6: same as row 3: 228. Correct. So all row sums are correct.\n\nSo why the discrepancy in totals? Let me check the column sums again. Maybe I made an error in the column assignments. Let me recheck each column.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in mapping the symbols to columns. Let me re-express the grid with the symbols and their positions.\n\nLet me write the grid as a 6x6 matrix:\n\nRow 1: ∀ ∉ @ ∉ ∅ ∀  \nRow 2: ∅ # @ ∅ @ ∅  \nRow 3: ∉ ∉ # ∀ ∀ @  \nRow 4: ∅ ∅ ∅ @ ∉ ∅  \nRow 5: ∉ ∉ ∀ # ∉ ∅  \nRow 6: ∀ ∉ ∉ ∀ # @  \n\nNow, columns are:\n\nColumn 1: Row1: ∀, Row2: ∅, Row3: ∉, Row4: ∅, Row5: ∉, Row6: ∀ → A, D, B, D, B, A → correct.\n\nColumn 2: Row1: ∉, Row2: #, Row3: ∉, Row4: ∅, Row5: ∉, Row6: ∉ → B, E, B, D, B, B → correct.\n\nColumn 3: Row1: @, Row2: @, Row3: #, Row4: ∅, Row5: ∀, Row6: ∉ → C, C, E, D, A, B → correct.\n\nColumn 4: Row1: ∉, Row2: ∅, Row3: ∀, Row4: @, Row5: #, Row6: ∀ → B, D, A, C, E, A → correct.\n\nColumn 5: Row1: ∅, Row2: @, Row3: ∀, Row4: ∉, Row5: ∉, Row6: # → D, C, A, B, B, E → correct.\n\nColumn 6: Row1: ∀, Row2: ∅, Row3: @, Row4: ∅, Row5: ∅, Row6: @ → A, D, C, D, D, C → correct.\n\nSo columns are correct. Then why is the total sum different?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the column sum calculations. Let me re-calculate the column sums with the correct values.\n\nLet me re-calculate each column sum again, step by step.\n\nColumn 1: A(89) + D(-80) + B(66) + D(-80) + B(66) + A(89) = 89 -80 +66 -80 +66 +89. Let me add step by step:\n\nStart with 0.\n\nAdd 89: 89  \nAdd -80: 9  \nAdd 66: 75  \nAdd -80: -5  \nAdd 66: 61  \nAdd 89: 150. Correct.\n\nColumn 2: B(66) + E(-12) + B(66) + D(-80) + B(66) + B(66) = 66 -12 +66 -80 +66 +66. Let's compute:\n\n66 -12 = 54  \n+66 → 120  \n-80 → 40  \n+66 → 106  \n+66 → 172. Correct.\n\nColumn 3: C(-70) + C(-70) + E(-12) + D(-80) + A(89) + B(66) → -70 -70 -12 -80 +89 +66. \n\nAdding:\n\n-70 -70 = -140  \n-140 -12 = -152  \n-152 -80 = -232  \n-232 +89 = -143  \n-143 +66 = -77. Wait, previously I had -67. Oh! Here's the mistake! I must have miscalculated Column 3 earlier. Let me re-calculate Column 3.\n\nWait, Column 3's symbols are:\n\nRow1: C (-70)  \nRow2: C (-70)  \nRow3: E (-12)  \nRow4: D (-80)  \nRow5: A (89)  \nRow6: B (66)\n\nSo sum is:\n\n-70 + (-70) + (-12) + (-80) + 89 + 66.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nStart with 0.\n\nAdd -70 → -70  \nAdd -70 → -140  \nAdd -12 → -152  \nAdd -80 → -232  \nAdd 89 → -232 +89 = -143  \nAdd 66 → -143 +66 = -77. \n\nAh! Previously I had -67. That was a mistake. So Column 3 sum is -77, not -67. That explains the discrepancy. So where did I go wrong before?\n\nEarlier, I thought Column 3 was:\n\nRow4: C? Wait, no, in Column 3, Row4 is D. Let me check again.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow1: C  \nRow2: C  \nRow3: E  \nRow4: D  \nRow5: A  \nRow6: B\n\nYes. So the sum is -70-70-12-80+89+66 = -77. So I must have made a mistake in my earlier calculation. Let me redo that part.\n\nOriginal calculation for Column 3:\n\nRow1: -70  \nRow2: -70  \nRow3: -12  \nRow4: -70 (Wait, here I think I made a mistake. Row4's Column 3 is D, which is -80, not C. In my previous calculation I wrote Row4 as C, which is wrong. Let me check again.\n\nWait, Column 3 for Row4: looking back at the grid, Row4 is \"∅∅∅@∉∅\". So symbols are D, D, D, C, B, D. Wait, no: the Row4 is ∅ ∅ ∅ @ ∉ ∅. So columns 1 to 6 are:\n\nRow4: [D, D, D, C, B, D]. So Column 3 for Row4 is D (third symbol is ∅, which is D). Wait, no. Wait the third symbol in Row4 is ∅, which is D. But Column 3 is the third symbol of each row.\n\nAh! Wait, I think I made a mistake in Column 3's Row4 value. Let me re-express Column 3.\n\nColumn 3 is the third symbol of each row:\n\nRow1: third symbol is @ (C)  \nRow2: third symbol is @ (C)  \nRow3: third symbol is # (E)  \nRow4: third symbol is ∅ (D)  \nRow5: third symbol is ∀ (A)  \nRow6: third symbol is ∉ (B)  \n\nYes. So Column 3's Row4 is D (-80), not C. So in my previous calculation, I had:\n\nRow4: D (-80), not C. So the sum is:\n\nRow1: -70  \nRow2: -70  \nRow3: -12  \nRow4: -80  \nRow5: 89  \nRow6: 66  \n\nTotal sum: -70-70-12-80+89+66 = (-70-70) is -140; -140-12=-152; -152-80=-232; -232+89=-143; -143+66=-77. So Column 3 sum is -77, not -67. I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought Row4's Column 3 was C. That's where the error was. So this changes the column sums.\n\nLet me recalculate all column sums with this correction.\n\nColumn 3 is now -77.\n\nNow, let's recompute the total column sum:\n\nColumn 1: 150  \nColumn 2: 172  \nColumn 3: -77  \nColumn 4: 82  \nColumn 5: 59  \nColumn 6: -291  \n\nTotal sum: 150 +172 = 322; 322 -77= 245; 245 +82= 327; 327 +59= 386; 386 -291= 95. Which matches the row sum total of 95. Great! So the mistake was in Column 3's calculation. Now I need to recalculate all column sums again, especially Column 3, and possibly others if there were errors.\n\nLet me recheck all columns now.\n\nColumn 1: 150 (correct)  \nColumn 2: 172 (correct)  \nColumn 3: -77 (correct)  \nColumn 4: Let me recheck.\n\nColumn 4: symbols are Row1: B, Row2: D, Row3: A, Row4: C, Row5: E, Row6: A.\n\nSo values: 66, -80, 89, -70, -12, 89.\n\nSum: 66 -80 +89 -70 -12 +89. Let's compute:\n\n66-80 = -14  \n-14 +89 = 75  \n75 -70 = 5  \n5 -12 = -7  \n-7 +89 = 82. Correct. Column 4 is 82.\n\nColumn 5: symbols are D, C, A, B, B, E.\n\nValues: -80, -70, 89, 66, 66, -12.\n\nSum: -80 -70 +89 +66 +66 -12.\n\nLet me calculate:\n\n-80-70 = -150  \n-150 +89 = -61  \n-61 +66 = 5  \n5 +66 = 71  \n71 -12 = 59. Correct. Column 5 is 59.\n\nColumn 6: symbols are A, D, C, D, D, C.\n\nValues: 89, -80, -70, -80, -80, -70.\n\nSum: 89 -80 -70 -80 -80 -70.\n\nCalculate:\n\n89 -80 = 9  \n9 -70 = -61  \n-61 -80 = -141  \n-141 -80 = -221  \n-221 -70 = -291. Correct. Column 6 is -291.\n\nNow the total column sum is 95, which matches the row sum total. So the correct column sums are:\n\n[150, 172, -77, 82, 59, -291]\n\nSo I need to correct my earlier mistake in Column 3. Let me verify Column 3 again.\n\nColumn 3 sum is -77. Let me check again:\n\n-70 (Row1) + -70 (Row2) + -12 (Row3) + -80 (Row4) + 89 (Row5) + 66 (Row6) = -70-70= -140; -140-12=-152; -152-80=-232; -232+89=-143; -143+66=-77. Correct.\n\nSo the correct column sums are [150, 172, -77, 82, 59, -291].\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be this list.\n ;Answer: [150, 172, -77, 82, 59, -291]"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to find the column sums based on the given grid and row sums. Each symbol represents a numerical value. The grid has rows with symbols and their corresponding row sums. My task is to figure out each column's sum.\n\nFirst, I should probably assign variables to each unique symbol. Let me list out the symbols present. Looking at the grid:\n\nSymbols are: ∂, ≈, ∈, @, and maybe others? Let me check each row:\n\nFirst row: ∂, ≈, ∈, @, ∂. So symbols here are ∂, ≈, ∈, @. The row sum is -9.\n\nSecond row: ∈, @, @, @, ∈. Sum is -143.\n\nThird row: ∈, @, ∈, ≈, @. Sum is -149.\n\nFourth row: ∂, @, ≈, ∂, ∂. Sum 93.\n\nFifth row: ≈, ≈, ≈, ≈, @. Sum -39.\n\nSixth row: ∈, ∂, ∈, ∈, ∂. Sum -131.\n\nSeventh row: ∂, ∂, ≈, ∂, @. Sum 93.\n\nSo the unique symbols are ∂, ≈, ∈, @. Let me assign variables to them. Let's say:\n\nLet ∂ = a\n\n≈ = b\n\n∈ = c\n\n@ = d\n\nNow, each row is an equation. For example, the first row has two ∂, one ≈, one ∈, and one @. So:\n\na + b + c + d + a = 2a + b + c + d = -9.\n\nSimilarly, for each row:\n\nRow 1: 2a + b + c + d = -9.\n\nRow 2: 2c + 3d = -143.\n\nRow 3: 2c + d + a + b? Wait, let me check the third row symbols again. The third row is ∈, @, ∈, ≈, @. So that's c, d, c, b, d. So total is 2c + 2d + b = -149. So equation: 2c + 2d + b = -149.\n\nRow 4: ∂, @, ≈, ∂, ∂ → a, d, b, a, a → 3a + d + b = 93.\n\nRow 5: four ≈ and one @ → 4b + d = -39.\n\nRow 6: ∈, ∂, ∈, ∈, ∂ → c, a, c, c, a → 2a + 3c = -131.\n\nRow 7: ∂, ∂, ≈, ∂, @ → 3a + b + d = 93.\n\nHmm. Now, I have several equations here. Let me list them all:\n\n1. 2a + b + c + d = -9. (Row 1)\n2. 2c + 3d = -143. (Row 2)\n3. 2c + 2d + b = -149. (Row 3)\n4. 3a + b + d = 93. (Row 4)\n5. 4b + d = -39. (Row 5)\n6. 2a + 3c = -131. (Row 6)\n7. 3a + b + d = 93. (Row 7, same as row 4?)\n\nWait, row 4 and row 7 both have equations 3a + b + d = 93. So they are the same. So maybe there are redundant equations here. Let's see how many variables we have. There are four variables: a, b, c, d.\n\nSo with four variables, we need four independent equations. Let's see which equations we can use.\n\nLooking at equation 5: 4b + d = -39. Maybe we can express d in terms of b. Let's do that. From equation 5:\n\nd = -39 -4b.\n\nThen, equation 3: 2c + 2d + b = -149. Substitute d:\n\n2c + 2*(-39 -4b) + b = -149 → 2c -78 -8b +b = -149 → 2c -7b = -149 +78 → 2c -7b = -71. Let's call this equation 3a.\n\nEquation 2: 2c + 3d = -143. Substitute d again:\n\n2c +3*(-39 -4b) = -143 → 2c -117 -12b = -143 → 2c -12b = -143 +117 → 2c -12b = -26 → 2c = 12b -26 → c = 6b -13. Let's call this equation 2a.\n\nNow, substitute c from equation 2a into equation 3a:\n\n2*(6b -13) -7b = -71 → 12b -26 -7b = -71 → 5b -26 = -71 → 5b = -71 +26 → 5b = -45 → b = -9.\n\nNow that we have b = -9, let's find d from equation 5:\n\nd = -39 -4*(-9) = -39 +36 = -3.\n\nSo d = -3.\n\nNow, from equation 2a, c = 6b -13 = 6*(-9) -13 = -54 -13 = -67. So c = -67.\n\nNow, equation 6: 2a +3c = -131. Substitute c:\n\n2a +3*(-67) = -131 → 2a -201 = -131 → 2a = 70 → a = 35.\n\nSo a = 35.\n\nNow check equation 4 (and 7): 3a +b +d = 3*35 + (-9) + (-3) = 105 -12 = 93. Which matches the row sum. Good.\n\nNow check equation 1: 2a +b +c +d = 2*35 + (-9) + (-67) + (-3) = 70 -9 -67 -3 = 70 -79 = -9. Which matches row 1. Good.\n\nSo variables:\n\na (∂) = 35\n\nb (≈) = -9\n\nc (∈) = -67\n\nd (@) = -3\n\nNow, the next step is to compute the column sums. The grid has 5 columns. Each column has 7 entries (since there are 7 rows). Let me reconstruct the grid's columns.\n\nOriginal grid rows:\n\nRow 1: ∂ ≈ ∈ @ ∂ → columns 1 to 5: [∂, ≈, ∈, @, ∂]\n\nRow 2: ∈ @ @ @ ∈ → [∈, @, @, @, ∈]\n\nRow 3: ∈ @ ∈ ≈ @ → [∈, @, ∈, ≈, @]\n\nRow 4: ∂ @ ≈ ∂ ∂ → [∂, @, ≈, ∂, ∂]\n\nRow 5: ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ @ → [≈, ≈, ≈, ≈, @]\n\nRow 6: ∈ ∂ ∈ ∈ ∂ → [∈, ∂, ∈, ∈, ∂]\n\nRow 7: ∂ ∂ ≈ ∂ @ → [∂, ∂, ≈, ∂, @]\n\nSo columns are:\n\nColumn 1: Row1: ∂, Row2: ∈, Row3: ∈, Row4: ∂, Row5: ≈, Row6: ∈, Row7: ∂.\n\nColumn 2: Row1: ≈, Row2: @, Row3: @, Row4: @, Row5: ≈, Row6: ∂, Row7: ∂.\n\nColumn 3: Row1: ∈, Row2: @, Row3: ∈, Row4: ≈, Row5: ≈, Row6: ∈, Row7: ≈.\n\nColumn 4: Row1: @, Row2: @, Row3: ≈, Row4: ∂, Row5: ≈, Row6: ∈, Row7: ∂.\n\nColumn 5: Row1: ∂, Row2: ∈, Row3: @, Row4: ∂, Row5: @, Row6: ∂, Row7: @.\n\nNow, for each column, substitute the symbols with their values and sum them up.\n\nLet me compute each column step by step.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nEntries: ∂, ∈, ∈, ∂, ≈, ∈, ∂.\n\nValues:\n\n∂ = 35, ∈ = -67, ≈ = -9.\n\nSo:\n\n35 + (-67) + (-67) + 35 + (-9) + (-67) + 35.\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nStart with 35.\n\nAdd -67: 35 -67 = -32.\n\nAdd -67: -32 -67 = -99.\n\nAdd 35: -99 +35 = -64.\n\nAdd -9: -64 -9 = -73.\n\nAdd -67: -73 -67 = -140.\n\nAdd 35: -140 +35 = -105.\n\nSo column 1 sum is -105.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nEntries: ≈, @, @, @, ≈, ∂, ∂.\n\nValues: ≈=-9, @=-3, ∂=35.\n\nSo:\n\n-9 + (-3) + (-3) + (-3) + (-9) + 35 + 35.\n\nCalculate:\n\nStart with -9.\n\n-3 → -12, -3 → -15, -3 → -18, -9 → -27, +35 → 8, +35 → 43.\n\nSo column 2 sum is 43.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nEntries: ∈, @, ∈, ≈, ≈, ∈, ≈.\n\nValues: ∈=-67, @=-3, ≈=-9.\n\nSo:\n\n-67 + (-3) + (-67) + (-9) + (-9) + (-67) + (-9).\n\nCalculating:\n\nStart with -67.\n\n-3 → -70, -67 → -137, -9 → -146, -9 → -155, -67 → -222, -9 → -231.\n\nColumn 3 sum is -231.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nEntries: @, @, ≈, ∂, ≈, ∈, ∂.\n\nValues: @=-3, ≈=-9, ∂=35, ∈=-67.\n\nSo:\n\n-3 + (-3) + (-9) + 35 + (-9) + (-67) + 35.\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n-3 -3 = -6.\n\n-6 -9 = -15.\n\n+35 → 20.\n\n-9 → 11.\n\n-67 → -56.\n\n+35 → -21.\n\nSo column 4 sum is -21.\n\nColumn 5:\n\nEntries: ∂, ∈, @, ∂, @, ∂, @.\n\nValues: ∂=35, ∈=-67, @=-3.\n\nSo:\n\n35 + (-67) + (-3) + 35 + (-3) + 35 + (-3).\n\nCalculating:\n\nStart with 35 -67 = -32.\n\n-3 → -35.\n\n+35 → 0.\n\n-3 → -3.\n\n+35 → 32.\n\n-3 → 29.\n\nSo column 5 sum is 29.\n\nLet me verify the calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFor column 1:\n\n35 (Row1) + (-67) (Row2) + (-67) (Row3) + 35 (Row4) + (-9) (Row5) + (-67) (Row6) + 35 (Row7).\n\nLet me add them:\n\n35 -67 = -32.\n\n-32 -67 = -99.\n\n-99 +35 = -64.\n\n-64 -9 = -73.\n\n-73 -67 = -140.\n\n-140 +35 = -105.

      "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the sum of each column in this grid based on the given row sums. First, I have to understand the symbols and their corresponding numerical values. But wait, the problem doesn't give me the values for the symbols directly. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nThe grid has rows with symbols and each row's total sum is provided. So maybe I can set up equations for each row where the sum of the symbols in that row equals the given total. Then, solve those equations to find the value of each symbol. Once I have the symbol values, I can compute the column sums.\n\nLet me start by listing out all the rows and their symbols. Let me write them down properly. Each row has 8 symbols, I think. Let me check:\n\nFirst row: ∫ ⇔ ∩ ∩ ∩ * ∫ * → sum 510\nSecond: ∉ ∩ ⇔ ∫ ∉ ∩ ⇔ ∫ → 228\nThird: ∉ * * ⇔ ? ? ∉ * → 42\nFourth: * ∩ ∫ ∩ ∩ ∩ ? ⇔ → 428\nFifth: ∩ ? ? ∉ * ∫ ∉ ∩ → 146\nSixth: ∉ ⇔ ∩ ⇔ ⇔ ∉ ∩ ∫ → 164\nSeventh: ? ∫ ∩ ∩ ∩ ? ? ⇔ → 216\n\nWait, each row has 8 symbols. Let me count the symbols in each row to confirm:\n\nFirst row: ∫, ⇔, ∩, ∩, ∩, *, ∫, * → 8 symbols. Correct.\n\nSo there are 7 rows and 8 columns. The symbols involved are: ∫, ⇔, ∩, *, ∉, ?, and maybe others? Let me check all symbols. The symbols present are ∫, ⇔, ∩, *, ∉, ?, and maybe others? Let me list all unique symbols:\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nRow 1: ∫, ⇔, ∩, *, so symbols ∫, ⇔, ∩, *.\n\nRow 2: ∉, ∩, ⇔, ∫, so ∉, ∩, ⇔, ∫.\n\nRow 3: ∉, *, ⇔, ?, ∉, * → symbols ∉, *, ⇔, ?\n\nRow 4: *, ∩, ∫, ∩, ?, ⇔ → *, ∩, ∫, ?\n\nRow 5: ∩, ?, ∉, *, ∫, ∩ → ∩, ?, ∉, *, ∫.\n\nRow 6: ∉, ⇔, ∩, ⇔, ∉, ∩, ∫ → ∉, ⇔, ∩, ∫.\n\nRow 7: ?, ∫, ∩, ?, ⇔ → ?, ∫, ∩, ⇔.\n\nSo the unique symbols are: ∫, ⇔, ∩, *, ∉, ?.\n\nSo there are six different symbols. Let me assign variables to each symbol:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet’s say:\n\nA = ∫\n\nB = ⇔\n\nC = ∩\n\nD = *\n\nE = ∉\n\nF = ?\n\nSo now, each row can be translated into an equation.\n\nLet me process each row:\n\nRow 1: A, B, C, C, C, D, A, D → sum is A + B + C + C + C + D + A + D = 2A + B + 3C + 2D = 510.\n\nRow 2: E, C, B, A, E, C, B, A → E + C + B + A + E + C + B + A = 2A + 2B + 2C + 2E = 228. Dividing both sides by 2: A + B + C + E = 114.\n\nRow 3: E, D, D, B, F, F, E, D → E + D + D + B + F + F + E + D = 2E + 3D + B + 2F = 42.\n\nRow 4: D, C, A, C, C, C, F, B → D + C + A + C + C + C + F + B = A + B + D + 4C + F = 428.\n\nRow 5: C, F, F, E, D, A, E, C → C + F + F + E + D + A + E + C = 2C + 2E + 2F + A + D = 146.\n\nRow 6: E, B, C, B, B, E, C, A → E + B + C + B + B + E + C + A = A + 3B + 2C + 2E = 164.\n\nRow 7: F, A, C, C, C, F, F, B → F + A + C + C + C + F + F + B = A + B + 3C + 3F = 216.\n\nSo now, I have the following equations:\n\nEquation 1: 2A + B + 3C + 2D = 510.\n\nEquation 2: A + B + C + E = 114.\n\nEquation 3: 2E + 3D + B + 2F = 42.\n\nEquation 4: A + B + D + 4C + F = 428.\n\nEquation 5: A + D + 2C + 2E + 2F = 146.\n\nEquation 6: A + 3B + 2C + 2E = 164.\n\nEquation 7: A + B + 3C + 3F = 216.\n\nNow, I need to solve this system of equations for variables A, B, C, D, E, F.\n\nLet me note down all equations again:\n\n1. 2A + B + 3C + 2D = 510.\n\n2. A + B + C + E = 114.\n\n3. 2E + 3D + B + 2F = 42.\n\n4. A + B + D + 4C + F = 428.\n\n5. A + D + 2C + 2E + 2F = 146.\n\n6. A + 3B + 2C + 2E = 164.\n\n7. A + B + 3C + 3F = 216.\n\nThis seems complex, but maybe we can find substitutions.\n\nLet me see if I can express E from equation 2.\n\nFrom equation 2: E = 114 - A - B - C.

Let me note that.\n\nEquation 6a: B = A - 64.\n\nSo B can be expressed in terms of A.\n\nNow, equation 7: A + B + 3C + 3F = 216.\n\nAgain, substitute B from equation 6a:\n\nA + (A - 64) + 3C + 3F = 216 → 2A - 64 + 3C + 3F = 216 → 2A + 3C + 3F = 280. Let's call this equation 7a.\n\nNow, equation 4: A + B + D + 4C + F = 428.\n\nAgain, substitute B = A - 64:\n\nA + (A - 64) + D + 4C + F = 428 → 2A -64 + D + 4C + F = 428 → 2A + D + 4C + F = 492. Equation 4a.\n\nEquation 1: 2A + B + 3C + 2D = 510.\n\nSubstitute B = A - 64:\n\n2A + (A - 64) + 3C + 2D = 510 → 3A - 64 + 3C + 2D = 510 → 3A + 3C + 2D = 574. Equation 1a.\n\nNow, let me see if I can find other relations. Let's check equation 5a: -A - 2B + D + 2F = -82.\n\nAgain, substitute B = A - 64 into equation 5a:\n\n- A - 2*(A -64) + D + 2F = -82.\n\nCompute:\n\n- A - 2A + 128 + D + 2F = -82 → -3A + D + 2F = -82 - 128 = -210.\n\nEquation 5b: -3A + D + 2F = -210.\n\nSimilarly, equation 3a: -2A - B - 2C + 3D + 2F = -186.\n\nAgain, substitute B = A - 64 into equation 3a:\n\n-2A - (A -64) - 2C + 3D + 2F = -186 → -2A -A +64 -2C +3D +2F = -186 → -3A -2C +3D +2F = -250.\n\nEquation 3b: -3A -2C +3D +2F = -250.\n\nNow, let me note equations involving A, C, D, F.\n\nWe have equation 5b: -3A + D + 2F = -210.\n\nEquation 3b: -3A -2C +3D +2F = -250.\n\nLet me subtract equation 5b from equation 3b to eliminate some variables.\n\nEquation 3b - equation 5b:\n\n[ (-3A -2C +3D +2F) ] - [ (-3A + D + 2F) ] = -250 - (-210).\n\nCompute left side:\n\n-3A -2C +3D +2F +3A - D - 2F = (-2C) + (3D - D) = -2C + 2D.\n\nRight side: -250 + 210 = -40.\n\nSo:\n\n-2C + 2D = -40 → divide by 2: -C + D = -20 → D = C - 20. Equation 8.\n\nNow, equation 8: D = C - 20.\n\nSo D can be expressed in terms of C.\n\nNow, let me substitute D = C - 20 into equation 5b: -3A + D + 2F = -210.\n\nSubstitute D:\n\n-3A + (C - 20) + 2F = -210 → -3A + C - 20 + 2F = -210 → -3A + C + 2F = -190. Equation 5c.\n\nAlso, equation 7a: 2A + 3C + 3F = 280.\n\nLet me see if I can find another equation involving these variables. Let's look at equation 4a: 2A + D + 4C + F = 492. Substitute D = C - 20:\n\n2A + (C - 20) + 4C + F = 492 → 2A + 5C + F -20 = 492 → 2A +5C + F = 512. Equation 4b.\n\nEquation 4b: 2A +5C + F = 512.\n\nEquation 5c: -3A + C + 2F = -190.\n\nEquation 7a: 2A + 3C + 3F = 280.\n\nSo now, we have three equations with variables A, C, F.\n\nLet me write them again:\n\nEquation 4b: 2A +5C + F = 512.\n\nEquation 5c: -3A + C + 2F = -190.\n\nEquation 7a: 2A +3C +3F = 280.\n\nLet me try to solve these equations.\n\nFirst, perhaps express F from equation 4b in terms of A and C.\n\nFrom equation 4b: F = 512 - 2A -5C.\n\nSubstitute this into equation 5c and equation 7a.\n\nEquation 5c substitution:\n\n-3A + C + 2*(512 - 2A -5C) = -190.\n\nCompute:\n\n-3A + C + 1024 -4A -10C = -190 → (-7A) -9C + 1024 = -190 → -7A -9C = -190 -1024 = -1214 → 7A +9C = 1214. Equation 5d.\n\nEquation 7a substitution:\n\n2A +3C +3*(512 -2A -5C) = 280.\n\nCompute:\n\n2A +3C + 1536 -6A -15C = 280 → (-4A) -12C +1536 = 280 → -4A -12C = 280 -1536 = -1256 → Divide both sides by -4: A + 3C = 314. Equation 7b.\n\nNow, equation 7b: A = 314 - 3C.\n\nNow substitute A into equation 5d: 7A +9C = 1214.\n\nSubstitute A = 314 -3C:\n\n7*(314 -3C) +9C = 1214 → 2198 -21C +9C = 1214 → 2198 -12C = 1214 → -12C = 1214 -2198 → -12C = -984 → C = (-984)/(-12) = 82.\n\nSo C = 82.\n\nNow, from equation 7b: A = 314 -3*82 = 314 -246 = 68. So A = 68.\n\nNow, since B = A -64 (from equation 6a), B = 68 -64 = 4. So B = 4.\n\nFrom equation 8: D = C -20 = 82 -20 = 62. So D = 62.\n\nFrom equation 4b: F = 512 -2A -5C. Let's compute:\n\nF = 512 -2*68 -5*82 = 512 -136 -410 = 512 -546 = -34. So F = -34.\n\nNow, from equation 2a: E = 114 -A -B -C = 114 -68 -4 -82 = 114 -154 = -40. So E = -40.\n\nLet me check if these values satisfy all equations.\n\nLet me check equation 3b: -3A -2C +3D +2F = ?\n\nA=68, C=82, D=62, F=-34.\n\n-3*68 = -204; -2*82 = -164; 3*62=186; 2*(-34)=-68. Sum: -204 -164 +186 -68 = (-368) + (186 -68) = -368 + 118 = -250. Which matches equation 3b's RHS (-250). Good.\n\nEquation 5c: -3A + C + 2F = ?\n\n-3*68 +82 + 2*(-34) = -204 +82 -68 = (-204 -68) +82 = -272 +82 = -190. Which matches equation 5c's RHS. Good.\n\nEquation 4b: 2A +5C +F = 2*68 +5*82 + (-34) = 136 + 410 -34 = 546 -34 = 512. Correct.\n\nEquation 7a: 2A +3C +3F = 2*68 + 3*82 +3*(-34) = 136 + 246 -102 = 382 -102 = 280. Correct.\n\nNow check equation 3: original equation 3: 2E +3D +B +2F = 42.\n\nE=-40, D=62, B=4, F=-34.\n\n2*(-40) = -80; 3*62=186; B=4; 2*(-34)=-68. Sum: -80 +186 +4 -68 = (106) + (4) = 110? Wait:\n\n-80 + 186 is 106. 106 +4 is 110. 110 -68 is 42. Yes. Correct.\n\nEquation 5: original equation 5 was after substitution. Let me check equation 5a: -A -2B + D + 2F = -82.\n\nA=68, B=4, D=62, F=-34.\n\n-68 -2*4 +62 +2*(-34) = -68 -8 +62 -68 = (-76) + (62 -68) = -76 -6 = -82. Correct.\n\nEquation 6: original equation 6 was A + 3B + 2C + 2E = 164.\n\nA=68, B=4, C=82, E=-40.\n\n68 + 3*4 + 2*82 + 2*(-40) = 68 +12 +164 -80 = (68+12)=80; 80+164=244; 244-80=164. Correct.\n\nEquation 1: original equation 1: 2A + B +3C +2D = 510.\n\n2*68 = 136; B=4; 3*82=246; 2*62=124. Sum: 136 +4 +246 +124 = 136+4=140; 140+246=386; 386+124=510. Correct.\n\nEquation 2: A + B + C + E = 68 +4 +82 + (-40) = 154 -40 = 114. Correct.\n\nEquation 7: original equation 7: A + B +3C +3F = 68 +4 +3*82 +3*(-34) = 72 +246 -102 = 72 +144 = 216. Correct.\n\nEquation 4: original equation 4: A + B + D +4C +F = 68 +4 +62 +4*82 + (-34) = 68+4=72; 72+62=134; 4*82=328; 134 +328=462; 462 -34=428. Correct.\n\nSo all equations are satisfied. Now, we have the values:\n\nA = ∫ = 68\n\nB = ⇔ = 4\n\nC = ∩ = 82\n\nD = * = 62\n\nE = ∉ = -40\n\nF = ? = -34\n\nNow, the task is to compute the column sums. There are 8 columns. Each column has 7 entries (since there are 7 rows). Let me list each column's symbols and compute their sum.\n\nFirst, let me write down the grid again with the symbols and their positions:\n\nRow 1: [∫, ⇔, ∩, ∩, ∩, *, ∫, *] → values [68, 4, 82, 82, 82, 62, 68, 62]\n\nRow 2: [∉, ∩, ⇔, ∫, ∉, ∩, ⇔, ∫] → [-40, 82, 4, 68, -40, 82, 4, 68]\n\nRow 3: [∉, *, *, ⇔, ?, ?, ∉, *] → [-40, 62, 62, 4, -34, -34, -40, 62]\n\nRow 4: [*, ∩, ∫, ∩, ∩, ∩, ?, ⇔] → [62, 82, 68, 82, 82, 82, -34, 4]\n\nRow 5: [∩, ?, ?, ∉, *, ∫, ∉, ∩] → [82, -34, -34, -40, 62, 68, -40, 82]\n\nRow 6: [∉, ⇔, ∩, ⇔, ⇔, ∉, ∩, ∫] → [-40, 4, 82, 4, 4, -40, 82, 68]\n\nRow 7: [?, ∫, ∩, ∩, ∩, ?, ?, ⇔] → [-34, 68, 82, 82, 82, -34, -34, 4]\n\nNow, for each column (columns 0 to 7?), let me compute the sum.\n\nLet me index columns from 0 to 7 (assuming left to right).\n\nLet me process each column one by one.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow 1: ∫ (68)\n\nRow 2: ∉ (-40)\n\nRow 3: ∉ (-40)\n\nRow 4: * (62)\n\nRow 5: ∩ (82)\n\nRow 6: ∉ (-40)\n\nRow 7: ?

      "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a grid of symbols, each representing a numerical value. The rows have their sums provided, and we need to find the column sums. Hmm. First, I need to figure out what each symbol stands for. Let me note down the symbols and their possible equations.\n\nLooking at the grid:\n\nRow 1: ¬ ⇔ ! ! ≈ → Sum: -214  \nRow 2: ¬ ≈ ¬ ⇔ ! → Sum: -159  \nRow 3: ! ¬ ⇔ ¬ ≈ → Sum: -159  \nRow 4: ≈ ⇔ ! ! ⇔ → Sum: -271  \nRow 5: ! ≈ ! ≈ ! → Sum: -84  \nRow 6: ≈ ⇔ ⇔ ⇔ ⇔ → Sum: -275  \nRow 7: ⇔ ⇔ ! ⇔ ¬ → Sum: -401  \nRow 8: ≈ ! ⇔ ⇔ ⇔ → Sum: -273  \n\nEach row has 5 symbols. Let me assign variables to each unique symbol. Let's say:\n\nLet’s denote each symbol as follows:\nLet’s pick symbols: ¬, ⇔, !, ≈. Wait, are there any other symbols? Let me check. The symbols in the grid are ¬, ⇔, !, ≈. So four symbols. Let me assign variables:\n\nLet’s let:\nA = ¬  \nB = ⇔  \nC = !  \nD = ≈  \n\nNow, each row can be translated into an equation using these variables. Let me write them out:\n\nRow 1: A + B + C + C + D = -214 → A + B + 2C + D = -214  \nRow 2: A + D + A + B + C = -159 → 2A + D + B + C = -159  \nRow 3: C + A + B + A + D = -159 → 2A + B + C + D = -159  \nRow 4: D + B + C + C + B = -271 → D + 2B + 2C = -271  \nRow 5: C + D + C + D + C = -84 → 3C + 2D = -84  \nRow 6: D + B + B + B + B = -275 → D + 4B = -275  \nRow 7: B + B + C + B + A = -401 → 3B + C + A = -401  \nRow 8: D + C + B + B + B = -273 → D + C + 3B = -273  \n\nHmm, okay. Now, we have a system of equations here. Let me see how many equations and variables. There are 4 variables (A, B, C, D) and 8 equations. But since there are more equations than variables, we need to check for consistency.\n\nLet me start with equations that might be easier to solve. For example, Row 6 and Row 8 both involve D, B, and maybe others. Let's look at Row 6: D + 4B = -275. Row 8: D + C + 3B = -273. If we can find another equation involving C, maybe we can solve.\n\nAlso, Row 5: 3C + 2D = -84.\n\nLet me try to solve these equations step by step.\n\nFirst, let's take Row 6: D = -275 -4B. Let's substitute D into other equations.\n\nLet me substitute D into Row 8:\n\nD + C + 3B = -273  \n(-275 -4B) + C + 3B = -273  \n-275 - B + C = -273  \nSo rearranged: C - B = -273 + 275 = 2 → C = B + 2. (Equation 9)\n\nNow, let's substitute D into Row 5: 3C + 2*(-275 -4B) = -84  \n3C - 550 -8B = -84  \n3C -8B = 466  \nBut from Equation 9, C = B + 2. Substitute that:\n\n3*(B + 2) -8B = 466  \n3B +6 -8B = 466  \n-5B +6 = 466  \n-5B = 460 → B = -92.\n\nSo B is -92. Now, from Equation 9: C = -92 +2 = -90.\n\nNow, D from Row 6: D = -275 -4B = -275 -4*(-92) = -275 + 368 = 93. Wait, 4*92 is 368. 368 - 275 is 93? Let me check: 275 + 93 = 368? 275 + 90 is 365, plus 3 is 368. Yes. So D=93.\n\nSo B=-92, C=-90, D=93. Now, need to find A.\n\nLet me use another equation. Let's take Row 7: 3B + C + A = -401. Plugging in B=-92, C=-90:\n\n3*(-92) + (-90) + A = -401  \n-276 -90 + A = -401  \n-366 + A = -401  \nA = -401 + 366 = -35. So A = -35.\n\nLet me check if these values satisfy other equations. Let's check Row 1: A + B + 2C + D = -35 + (-92) + 2*(-90) +93.\n\nCalculating:\n\n-35 -92 = -127; 2*(-90) = -180. So total so far: -127 -180 = -307. Adding D=93: -307 +93 = -214. Which matches Row 1's sum. Good.\n\nCheck Row 2: 2A + D + B + C = 2*(-35) +93 + (-92) + (-90). \n\n2*(-35) is -70. Then 93 -92 is 1. Then 1 -90 is -89. Then -70 -89 = -159. Which matches Row 2's sum. Good.\n\nRow 3: 2A + B + C + D = 2*(-35) + (-92) + (-90) +93. \n\n2*(-35) is -70. Then -70 -92 = -162; -162 -90 = -252; -252 +93 = -159. Correct for Row 3.\n\nRow 4: D + 2B + 2C = 93 + 2*(-92) + 2*(-90) = 93 -184 -180 = 93 - 364 = -271. Correct for Row 4.\n\nRow 5: 3C + 2D = 3*(-90) + 2*(93) = -270 + 186 = -84. Correct.\n\nRow 6: D +4B = 93 +4*(-92) = 93 - 368 = -275. Correct.\n\nRow 7: 3B + C + A = 3*(-92) + (-90) + (-35) = -276 -90 -35 = -401. Correct.\n\nRow 8: D + C + 3B = 93 + (-90) + 3*(-92) = 3 - 276 = -273. Correct. All equations check out. Great, so the values are:\n\nA (¬) = -35  \nB (⇔) = -92  \nC (!) = -90  \nD (≈) = 93  \n\nNow, we need to compute the sum of each column. The grid has 5 columns.

      "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the column sums for this grid based on the row sums provided. First, I need to understand the symbols and their corresponding numerical values. But wait, the problem doesn't give me the values for each symbol directly. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nWait, the problem says that each symbol represents a numerical value. But how do I find out what each symbol is worth? Oh, right, the row sums are given. So each row's symbols add up to the number provided. Since there are multiple rows with the same symbols, maybe I can set up equations to solve for each symbol's value.\n\nLet me list out the grid again. Each row has a sequence of symbols and a sum. Let's assign variables to each symbol. Let's see what symbols are present. Looking at the grid:\n\nSymbols present are: ⇔, ∩, ∅, ¬, ∫. So five different symbols. Let me note them down:\n\nLet me assign variables:\n\nLet’s say:\nA = ⇔\nB = ∩\nC = ∅\nD = ¬\nE = ∫\n\nNow, each row can be translated into an equation. Let's go row by row.\n\nFirst row: ⇔ ∩ ∅ ∅ ¬ ⇔ ∫ ∅ → sum is -79\nSo symbols are A, B, C, C, D, A, E, C. So the equation is:\nA + B + C + C + D + A + E + C = -79 → 2A + B + 3C + D + E = -79. Let's note that as Equation 1.\n\nSecond row: ∩ ∩ ∩ ∅ ∫ ∫ ⇔ ∫ → sum -115\nSymbols: B, B, B, C, E, E, A, E → 3B + C + 3E + A = -115. Equation 2.\n\nThird row: ∅ ¬ ⇔ ∫ ∅ ¬ ∅ ∩ → sum -77\nSymbols: C, D, A, E, C, D, C, B → C + D + A + E + C + D + C + B → A + B + 3C + 2D + E = -77. Equation 3.\n\nFourth row: ∅ ∅ ∅ ∫ ∩ ⇔ ¬ ∫ → sum -162\nSymbols: C, C, C, E, B, A, D, E → 3C + 2E + B + A + D = -162. Equation 4.\n\nFifth row: ∫ ∩ ∩ ∅ ∫ ∩ ∅ ∩ → sum -114\nSymbols: E, B, B, C, E, B, C, B → E + 3B + 2C + 2E? Wait, let's count:\n\nE, B, B, C, E, B, C, B. So E appears twice, B appears four times, C appears twice. So 4B + 2C + 2E = -114. Equation 5.\n\nSixth row: ∩ ⇔ ∅ ∅ ⇔ ∫ ⇔ ∫ → sum -90\nSymbols: B, A, C, C, A, E, A, E → B + 3A + 2C + 2E = -90. Equation 6.\n\nSo now we have six equations with five variables. That seems overdetermined, but maybe there's a solution if the equations are consistent.\n\nLet me write all equations:\n\nEquation 1: 2A + B + 3C + D + E = -79\n\nEquation 2: A + 3B + C + 3E = -115\n\nEquation 3: A + B + 3C + 2D + E = -77\n\nEquation 4: A + B + 3C + D + 2E = -162\n\nEquation 5: 4B + 2C + 2E = -114 → simplifying by dividing by 2: 2B + C + E = -57. Equation 5'\n\nEquation 6: 3A + B + 2C + 2E = -90. Equation 6.\n\nNow, let's see how to solve these equations. Let me try to express variables step by step.\n\nFirst, maybe look for equations that can be combined. Let's note Equations 1, 3, 4, 5', 6.\n\nEquation 5' is 2B + C + E = -57. Let's keep that in mind.\n\nEquation 2: A + 3B + C + 3E = -115.\n\nHmm. Let's see if we can express A from Equation 2. Let me rearrange Equation 2:\n\nA = -115 -3B -C -3E. Equation 2a.\n\nSimilarly, maybe use Equation 5' to express C in terms of B and E: C = -57 -2B -E. Equation 5a.\n\nLet me substitute C from Equation 5a into Equation 2a.\n\nA = -115 -3B - [ -57 -2B -E ] -3E\n\nSimplify:\n\nA = -115 -3B +57 +2B +E -3E\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nA = (-115 +57) + (-3B +2B) + (E -3E)\n\nA = (-58) - B -2E → Equation 2b: A = -58 - B -2E.\n\nNow, let's look at Equation 6: 3A + B + 2C + 2E = -90.\n\nWe can substitute A from Equation 2b and C from Equation 5a into Equation 6.\n\nLet me do that:\n\n3*(-58 - B -2E) + B + 2*(-57 -2B -E) + 2E = -90\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: 3*(-58) = -174, 3*(-B) = -3B, 3*(-2E) = -6E → total is -174 -3B -6E.\n\nSecond term: +B.\n\nThird term: 2*(-57) = -114, 2*(-2B) = -4B, 2*(-E) = -2E → total is -114 -4B -2E.\n\nFourth term: +2E.\n\nSo combining all:\n\n-174 -3B -6E + B -114 -4B -2E + 2E = -90\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nConstants: -174 -114 = -288\n\nB terms: -3B + B -4B = (-3 +1 -4)B = -6B\n\nE terms: -6E -2E + 2E = (-6 -2 +2)E = -6E\n\nSo overall equation:\n\n-288 -6B -6E = -90\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n-6B -6E = -90 + 288 = 198 → divide both sides by -6:\n\nB + E = -33 → Equation 7: B + E = -33.\n\nSo from Equation 7, we can express B = -33 - E. Equation 7a.\n\nNow, let's substitute B from Equation 7a into Equation 5a (C = -57 -2B -E):\n\nC = -57 -2*(-33 -E) -E = -57 +66 + 2E - E → C = 9 + E. Equation 5b.\n\nAlso, from Equation 2b: A = -58 - B -2E. Substitute B from 7a:\n\nA = -58 - (-33 -E) -2E = -58 +33 + E -2E = -25 - E. Equation 2c.\n\nSo now, we have expressions for A, B, C in terms of E:\n\nA = -25 - E\n\nB = -33 - E\n\nC = 9 + E\n\nNow, let's use Equation 1 and Equation 3 to find D and E.\n\nEquation 1: 2A + B + 3C + D + E = -79.\n\nLet me substitute A, B, C with expressions in E.\n\n2*(-25 - E) + (-33 - E) + 3*(9 + E) + D + E = -79\n\nCompute each term:\n\n2*(-25) = -50, 2*(-E) = -2E → -50 -2E\n\nThen -33 - E.\n\nThen 3*(9) =27, 3*(E) =3E → 27 +3E\n\nSo combining all:\n\n-50 -2E -33 - E +27 +3E + D + E = -79\n\nCombine constants: -50 -33 +27 = (-83 +27) = -56\n\nCombine E terms: -2E -E +3E + E = (-3E +3E + E) = E\n\nSo equation becomes: -56 + E + D = -79 → D + E = -79 +56 = -23 → D = -23 - E. Equation 8.\n\nNow, let's check Equation 3: A + B + 3C + 2D + E = -77.\n\nSubstituting A, B, C, D in terms of E.\n\nA = -25 - E\n\nB = -33 - E\n\nC = 9 + E\n\nD = -23 - E\n\nEquation 3:\n\n(-25 - E) + (-33 - E) + 3*(9 + E) + 2*(-23 - E) + E = -77\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: -25 - E\n\nSecond term: -33 - E\n\nThird term: 27 + 3E\n\nFourth term: -46 - 2E\n\nFifth term: +E\n\nCombine all:\n\nConstants: -25 -33 +27 -46 = (-58) +27 -46 = (-58 -46) +27 = -104 +27 = -77\n\nE terms: -E -E +3E -2E +E = (-2E +3E -2E +E) = 0E. So all E terms cancel out.\n\nSo total equation is -77 + 0E = -77 → -77 = -77. Which is always true. So Equation 3 is satisfied regardless of E. So no new info here.\n\nNow check Equation 4: A + B + 3C + D + 2E = -162.\n\nAgain, substituting A, B, C, D in terms of E.\n\nEquation 4:\n\nA + B + 3C + D + 2E = ?\n\nSubstitute:\n\n(-25 - E) + (-33 - E) + 3*(9 + E) + (-23 - E) + 2E.\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\nConstants: -25 -33 + 27 (from 3*9) -23 = (-25 -33 -23) +27 = (-81) +27 = -54.\n\nE terms:\n\n- E - E + 3E - E + 2E = (-2E +3E -E +2E) = 2E.\n\nSo equation becomes: -54 + 2E = -162 → 2E = -162 +54 = -108 → E = -54.\n\nSo E = -54.\n\nNow we can find all other variables.\n\nFrom Equation 7a: B = -33 - E = -33 - (-54) = -33 +54 = 21.\n\nFrom Equation 5b: C = 9 + E = 9 + (-54) = -45.\n\nFrom Equation 2c: A = -25 - E = -25 - (-54) = -25 +54 = 29.\n\nFrom Equation 8: D = -23 - E = -23 - (-54) = -23 +54 = 31.\n\nSo now we have:\n\nA (⇔) = 29\n\nB (∩) = 21\n\nC (∅) = -45\n\nD (¬) = 31\n\nE (∫) = -54\n\nNow let's verify these values with all equations to ensure correctness.\n\nCheck Equation 1: 2A + B + 3C + D + E = 2*29 +21 +3*(-45) +31 + (-54) \n\nCalculate:\n\n2*29=58, 3*(-45)=-135.\n\nSo 58 +21 =79; 79 -135 = -56; -56 +31 = -25; -25 -54 = -79. Which matches Equation 1's sum of -79. Good.\n\nEquation 2: A +3B +C +3E = 29 +3*21 + (-45) +3*(-54)\n\nCalculate:\n\n3*21=63; 3*(-54)=-162.\n\n29 +63 =92; 92 -45=47; 47 -162 = -115. Correct for Equation 2.\n\nEquation 3: already checked, it's satisfied.\n\nEquation 4: A + B +3C + D +2E = 29 +21 +3*(-45) +31 +2*(-54)\n\nCompute:\n\n29+21=50; 3*(-45)=-135; 2*(-54)=-108.\n\nSo 50 -135 = -85; -85 +31 = -54; -54 -108 = -162. Correct for Equation 4.\n\nEquation 5: 2B + C + E = 2*21 + (-45) + (-54) =42 -45 -54 =42 -99 = -57. Which matches Equation 5'.\n\nEquation 6: 3A + B +2C +2E = 3*29 +21 +2*(-45) +2*(-54)\n\nCalculate:\n\n3*29=87; 2*(-45)=-90; 2*(-54)=-108.\n\n87 +21 = 108; 108 -90 =18; 18 -108 = -90. Correct for Equation 6.\n\nAll equations are satisfied. Great! So now we have the value for each symbol.\n\nNow, the next step is to compute the column sums. The grid has 8 columns (each row has 8 symbols). Let me list each column's symbols and compute their sum.\n\nFirst, let me write down the grid again with the symbols and their corresponding values:\n\nRow 1: ⇔ ∩ ∅ ∅ ¬ ⇔ ∫ ∅ → values: 29, 21, -45, -45, 31, 29, -54, -45 → sum -79 (already confirmed)\n\nRow 2: ∩ ∩ ∩ ∅ ∫ ∫ ⇔ ∫ → 21,21,21,-45,-54,-54,29,-54 → sum -115\n\nRow 3: ∅ ¬ ⇔ ∫ ∅ ¬ ∅ ∩ → -45,31,29,-54,-45,31,-45,21 → sum -77\n\nRow 4: ∅ ∅ ∅ ∫ ∩ ⇔ ¬ ∫ → -45,-45,-45,-54,21,29,31,-54 → sum -162\n\nRow 5: ∫ ∩ ∩ ∅ ∫ ∩ ∅ ∩ → -54,21,21,-45,-54,21,-45,21 → sum -114\n\nRow 6: ∩ ⇔ ∅ ∅ ⇔ ∫ ⇔ ∫ → 21,29,-45,-45,29,-54,29,-54 → sum -90\n\nNow, the columns are 8 columns. Let's index them from 0 to 7 (assuming first column is column 0). Let's find for each column (0-7), the sum of the values in that column.\n\nLet me list each column's symbols:\n\nColumn 0:\nRow1: ⇔ (29)\nRow2: ∩ (21)\nRow3: ∅ (-45)\nRow4: ∅ (-45)\nRow5: ∫ (-54)\nRow6: ∩ (21)\nSum: 29 +21 -45 -45 -54 +21 = ?\n\nCalculate step by step:\n\n29 +21 =50; 50 -45=5; 5 -45= -40; -40 -54= -94; -94 +21= -73.\n\nColumn 0 sum: -73.\n\nColumn 1:\nRow1: ∩ (21)\nRow2: ∩ (21)\nRow3: ¬ (31)\nRow4: ∅ (-45)\nRow5: ∩ (21)\nRow6: ⇔ (29)\nSum: 21 +21 +31 -45 +21 +29.\n\nCalculate:\n\n21+21=42; +31=73; -45=28; +21=49; +29=78.

Column2 sum: -64.\n\nColumn3:\nRow1: ∅ (-45)\nRow2: ∅ (-45)\nRow3: ∫ (-54)\nRow4: ∫ (-54)\nRow5: ∅ (-45)\nRow6: ∅ (-45)\nSum: -45 -45 -54 -54 -45 -45.\n\nLet me compute:\n\n-45*4 = -180, then -54*2 = -108. Total: -180 -108 = -288? Wait:\n\nWait, -45 (row1) + -45 (row2) = -90; + -54 (row3) = -144; + -54 (row4) = -198; + -45 (row5) = -243; + -45 (row6) = -288. Yes.

      "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the sum of each column in this grid based on the given row sums. First, I need to understand what each symbol represents numerically. The grid has symbols like ≤, ∃, ∫, -, and =. Wait, looking at the grid, maybe the symbols are consistent across rows and columns. Each row's sum is provided, so maybe I can use that to determine the value of each symbol.\n\nLet me list out the rows with their symbols and sums. Let me parse each row:\n\nRow 1: ≤ ≤ ≤ - ∃ → Sum: 84\nRow 2: ∫ ≤ - ∫ - → Sum: 42\nRow 3: ∃ - ∃ ∃ - → Sum: -24\nRow 4: - ∃ - ∫ ∫ → Sum: 0\nRow 5: ∃ - - ∃ ∫ → Sum: -12\nRow 6: ∫ - - ≤ ∫ → Sum: 42\nRow 7: ∃ ∫ ∃ ∫ ≤ → Sum: 6\nRow 8: - ∃ - - - → Sum: 12\nRow 9: ∫ ∃ ∫ ∃ ∫ → Sum: -24\n\nWait, the symbols per row might vary. Let me count how many symbols each row has. Let me check:\n\nRow 1: Symbols are 4 symbols? Let me check the first line: \"≤≤≤-∃\" Hmm, maybe each row has 5 symbols? Let me check each row's length:\n\nRow 1: \"≤≤≤-∃\" → Let's count the characters. The first row is written as \"≤≤≤-∃ 84\". So the symbols are 5 characters? Let me parse each row's symbols properly.\n\nWait, perhaps each row has five symbols. Let me check:\n\nRow 1: \"≤≤≤-∃\" → Let's count the symbols. Let's see:\n\nAssuming that each symbol is a single character. Let's split each row into symbols. For example, row 1: ≤, ≤, ≤, -, ∃. So five symbols? Wait, no, maybe the first row has five symbols. Let me check each row's symbols:\n\nRow 1: ≤ ≤ ≤ - ∃ → 5 symbols. Sum is 84.\nRow 2: ∫ ≤ - ∫ - → 5 symbols. Sum 42.\nRow 3: ∃ - ∃ ∃ - → 5 symbols. Sum -24.\nRow 4: - ∃ - ∫ ∫ → 5 symbols.

Sum -24.\n\nYes, each row has five symbols. So each row's sum is given. Now, I need to assign a value to each unique symbol. The symbols present are: ≤, ∃, ∫, -, and maybe others? Let me check all symbols. The symbols in the grid are:\n\n≤, ∃, ∫, -, and maybe others? Let me check all symbols in all rows:\n\nRow 1: ≤, ≤, ≤, -, ∃\nRow 2: ∫, ≤, -, ∫, -\nRow 3: ∃, -, ∃, ∃, -\nRow 4: -, ∃, -, ∫, ∫\nRow 5: ∃, -, -, ∃, ∫\nRow 6: ∫, -, -, ≤, ∫\nRow 7: ∃, ∫, ∃, ∫, ≤\nRow 8: -, ∃, -, -, -\nRow 9: ∫, ∃, ∫, ∃, ∫\n\nSo the symbols are: ≤, ∃, ∫, -, and maybe others? Let me check. Are there any other symbols? For example, the fifth symbol in row 1 is ∃, etc. So symbols are four: ≤, ∃, ∫, and -? Wait, the symbols are four types. Let me confirm. All symbols in the grid are:\n\n≤, ∃, ∫, and -.\n\nSo four symbols. Let me denote their values as variables. Let me assign:\n\nLet’s let:\n\nA = value of ≤\n\nB = value of ∃\n\nC = value of ∫\n\nD = value of -\n\nSo each symbol in a row is one of these four variables. Now, each row's sum is given. So I can set up equations based on the counts of each symbol in each row.\n\nFor example:\n\nRow 1 has three ≤, one -, and one ∃. So the equation is 3A + D + B = 84.\n\nSimilarly, for each row, I can write an equation.\n\nLet me list all equations:\n\nRow 1: 3A + D + B = 84. (three ≤, one -, one ∃)\n\nRow 2: C + A + D + C + D = 2C + A + 2D = 42. (one ∫, one ≤, two -, one ∫)\n\nRow 3: B + D + 2B + D = 3B + 2D = -24. (one ∃, one -, two ∃, one -)\n\nWait, row 3's symbols are ∃, -, ∃, ∃, -, so counts are three ∃ and two -, so equation is 3B + 2D = -24.\n\nRow 4: D + B + D + 2C = 2B + 2D + 2C? Wait, symbols are -, ∃, -, ∫, ∫. So counts are one ∃, two ∫, two -? Wait, symbols are: first -, then ∃, then -, then ∫, then ∫. So counts: B (1), C (2), D (2). So equation: B + 2C + 2D = 0.\n\nRow 5: ∃, -, -, ∃, ∫ → symbols: B (2), D (2), C (1). So equation: 2B + 2D + C = -12.\n\nRow 6: ∫, -, -, ≤, ∫ → symbols: C (2), D (2), A (1). Equation: 2C + 2D + A = 42.\n\nRow 7: ∃, ∫, ∃, ∫, ≤ → symbols: B (2), C (2), A (1). Equation: 2B + 2C + A = 6.\n\nRow 8: -, ∃, -, -, - → symbols: D (4), B (1). Equation: B + 4D = 12.\n\nRow 9: ∫, ∃, ∫, ∃, ∫ → symbols: C (3), B (2). Equation: 3C + 2B = -24.\n\nSo now, I have nine equations with four variables. But since there are four variables, perhaps some equations are redundant. Let me write all equations:\n\nEquation 1: 3A + B + D = 84.\n\nEquation 2: A + 2C + 2D = 42.\n\nEquation 3: 3B + 2D = -24.\n\nEquation 4: B + 2C + 2D = 0.\n\nEquation 5: 2B + C + 2D = -12. Wait, row 5: 2B + 2D + C? Wait, equation is 2B + C + 2D = -12?\n\nYes.\n\nEquation 6: A + 2C + 2D = 42. Wait, row 6: 2C + 2D + A = 42. So same as equation 2? Wait, equation 2 is from row 2: A + 2C + 2D = 42. And equation 6 is same: A + 2C + 2D = 42. So equations 2 and 6 are the same. So that's redundant.\n\nEquation 7: A + 2B + 2C = 6.\n\nEquation 8: B + 4D = 12.\n\nEquation 9: 2B + 3C = -24.\n\nSo now, I need to solve these equations. Let's start with equations that have fewer variables.\n\nLooking at equation 3: 3B + 2D = -24.\n\nEquation 8: B + 4D = 12.\n\nLet me solve equations 3 and 8 first. Let me write them:\n\nEquation 3: 3B + 2D = -24.\n\nEquation 8: B + 4D = 12.\n\nLet me solve these two equations. Let's use substitution or elimination. Let me multiply equation 8 by 3 to eliminate B:\n\nEquation 8 * 3: 3B + 12D = 36.\n\nEquation 3: 3B + 2D = -24.\n\nSubtract equation 3 from the modified equation 8:\n\n(3B +12D) - (3B +2D) = 36 - (-24)\n\nWhich gives 10D = 60 → D = 6.\n\nThen plug D=6 into equation 8: B + 4*6 = 12 → B +24=12 → B=12-24= -12.\n\nSo B = -12, D=6.\n\nNow, with B known, let's check equation 3: 3*(-12) + 2*6 = -36 +12 = -24. Correct.\n\nNow, moving to equation 9: 2B +3C = -24.\n\nWe know B=-12. So 2*(-12) + 3C = -24 → -24 + 3C = -24 → 3C=0 → C=0.\n\nSo C=0.\n\nNow check equation 4: B + 2C + 2D = 0 → (-12) + 2*0 + 2*6 = -12 + 0 +12 = 0. Correct.\n\nEquation 5: 2B + C + 2D = -12 → 2*(-12) + 0 + 2*6 = -24 +12 = -12. Correct.\n\nEquation 2 and 6 are same: A + 2C + 2D = 42. Since C=0, D=6, then A + 0 + 12 =42 → A=42-12=30. So A=30.\n\nCheck equation 1: 3A + B + D = 84 → 3*30 + (-12) +6 = 90 -12 +6= 84. Correct.\n\nEquation 7: A + 2B + 2C = 6. Let's check: 30 + 2*(-12) + 2*0 = 30 -24 +0 =6. Correct.\n\nSo all equations are satisfied. Now we have the values:\n\nA (≤) = 30\n\nB (∃) = -12\n\nC (∫) = 0\n\nD (-) = 6\n\nNow, the next step is to compute the column sums. Each column has 9 elements (since there are 9 rows). For each column (there are 5 columns), sum all the symbols in that column using their values.\n\nFirst, I need to determine what symbols are in each column. Let me reconstruct the grid column-wise.\n\nOriginal grid rows (each row is 5 symbols):\n\nRow 1: ≤ ≤ ≤ - ∃\n\nRow 2: ∫ ≤ - ∫ -\n\nRow 3: ∃ - ∃ ∃ -\n\nRow 4: - ∃ - ∫ ∫\n\nRow 5: ∃ - - ∃ ∫\n\nRow 6: ∫ - - ≤ ∫\n\nRow 7: ∃ ∫ ∃ ∫ ≤\n\nRow 8: - ∃ - - -\n\nRow 9: ∫ ∃ ∫ ∃ ∫\n\nLet me arrange the columns.

      "Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to compute the sum of each column in a grid of symbols, given the row sums. Each symbol represents a numerical value. The grid is provided along with the sum for each row. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem properly. The grid has rows and columns of symbols, and each row's total is given. My job is to find the sum for each column. Since each symbol has a fixed value, the same symbol in different positions (rows or columns) should have the same value. \n\nSo, the approach here is probably to set up equations based on the symbols in each row and their corresponding sums, then solve the system of equations to find the value of each symbol. Once I have the values for each symbol, I can compute the column sums by adding up the values of the symbols in each column.\n\nLet me start by listing out all the symbols present in the grid. Looking at the grid:\n\nSymbols are: #, ∫, ↓, ∴, ∵, ⊕, ≈, ↓, ∫, ∵, ⊕, etc. Wait, maybe I should list all unique symbols. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 1: #, ∫, ↓, ∴, ↓, ∫, ∵, ↓ → symbols are #, ∫, ↓, ∴, ∵\nRow 2: ∵, ∵, #, ⊕, ∴, ≈, ⊕, ↓ → adds ⊕, ≈\nRow 3: ↓, ⊕, ⊕, ∵, ∴, ∴, ↓, ∵ → already covered\nRow 4: ⊕, ∫, ∴, ≈, ∵, ∵, ≈, ∫ → same symbols\nRow 5: #, ≈, ∴, ↓, #, ∵, ∴, ⊕ → same as before\nRow 6: ∵, ↓, #, ↓, ∴, ∫, ≈, # → same\nRow 7: ∫, ∴, ≈, ↓, ∵, ∫, ≈, # → same\nRow 8: ∫, ∴, ↓, ≈, ↓, #, ⊕, ≈ → same\nRow 9: ∴, ⊕, ⊕, ∴, ∫, ≈, ∫, ≈ → same\n\nSo the unique symbols are: #, ∫, ↓, ∴, ∵, ⊕, ≈. Let me count them. That's 7 symbols. Each has a unique value. \n\nNow, each row's sum is given. For example, the first row's symbols are #, ∫, ↓, ∴, ↓, ∫, ∵, ↓. Let's note the count of each symbol in that row. Let's do this for each row. Then, we can create equations where the sum of (count of symbol * its value) equals the row's total. \n\nLet me assign variables to each symbol:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet a = # \n\nb = ∫ \n\nc = ↓ \n\nd = ∴ \n\ne = ∵ \n\nf = ⊕ \n\ng = ≈ \n\nSo, each row's equation will be based on the counts of these symbols multiplied by their variables, summing to the given row total.\n\nLet me process each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: #∫↓∴↓∫∵↓ → symbols are a, b, c, d, c, b, e, c. So counts: a:1, b:2, c:3, d:1, e:1, f:0, g:0. Sum is -4. So equation:\n\n1a + 2b + 3c + 1d + 1e = -4.\n\nRow 2: ∵∵#⊕∴≈⊕↓ → symbols e, e, a, f, d, g, f, c. Counts: a:1, e:2, f:2, d:1, g:1, c:1.

Simplify: d + f + b + g = -69.\n\nNow, I have 9 equations with 7 variables. That's overdetermined, but perhaps there is a solution. Let me write all equations:\n\nEquation 1: a + 2b + 3c + d + e = -4. (Row 1)\n\nEquation 2: a + 2e + 2f + d + c + g = -33. (Row 2)\n\nEquation 3: 2c + 2f + 2e + 2d = 46 → c + f + e + d = 23. (Row 3)\n\nEquation 4: f + 2b + d + 2g + 2e = -76. (Row 4)\n\nEquation 5: 2a + g + 2d + c + e + f = -133. (Row 5)\n\nEquation 6: 2a + b + 2c + d + e + g = -48. (Row 6)\n\nEquation 7: a + 2b + c + d + e + 2g = -48. (Row 7)\n\nEquation 8: a + b + 2c + d + f + 2g = 88. (Row 8)\n\nEquation 9: d + f + b + g = -69. (Row 9 simplified)\n\nNow, I need to solve this system. Let me see if I can find substitutions or relations between variables.\n\nFirst, Equation 3: c + f + e + d = 23. Let's note that.\n\nEquation 9: d + f + b + g = -69.\n\nLet me check if I can express some variables in terms of others.\n\nLet me start with Equation 3. Let's call Equation 3 as:\n\nEquation 3: c + d + e + f = 23.\n\nEquation 9: b + d + f + g = -69.\n\nPerhaps I can find relations between these.\n\nLooking at Equation 4: f + 2b + d + 2g + 2e = -76.\n\nEquation 4 can be written as 2b + d + f + 2g + 2e = -76.\n\nLet me see if I can use Equation 3 here. Since Equation 3 is c + d + e + f = 23. But Equation 4 has d + f + ... Hmm. Maybe not directly. Let me think of other equations.\n\nEquation 5: 2a + g + 2d + c + e + f = -133.\n\nBut from Equation 3, c + e + f = 23 - d. So substituting into Equation 5:\n\n2a + g + 2d + (23 - d) = -133 → 2a + g + 2d + 23 - d = -133 → 2a + g + d +23 = -133 → 2a + g + d = -156. Let's call this Equation 5a: 2a + g + d = -156.\n\nEquation 6: 2a + b + 2c + d + e + g = -48.\n\nAgain, from Equation 3: c + e + f = 23 - d. Wait, but Equation 6 has 2c + e. Hmm. Maybe I need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express variables step by step.\n\nLet me look for equations with fewer variables. For example, Equation 9: b + d + f + g = -69. Equation 3: c + d + e + f = 23. \n\nEquation 8: a + b + 2c + d + f + 2g = 88. Let me see. Maybe I can use Equation 9 here. Let me note that Equation 8 can be rewritten as a + (b + d + f + g) + 2c + g = 88. Because Equation 8 is a + b + 2c + d + f + 2g. Which is a + (b + d + f + g) + 2c + g? Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nOriginal Equation 8: a + b + 2c + d + f + 2g = a + b + d + f + 2c + 2g. So, if I take Equation 9 (b + d + f + g) = -69, then Equation 8 is a + (b + d + f + g) + 2c + g = a + (-69) + 2c + g = 88. Therefore:\n\na + 2c + g = 88 + 69 = 157. So Equation 8a: a + 2c + g = 157.\n\nHmm. Also, Equation 5a is 2a + g + d = -156.\n\nLet me see if I can find another equation involving a, d, g, etc.\n\nEquation 7: a + 2b + c + d + e + 2g = -48. Let me see if I can use Equation 3 here. From Equation 3, c + e + f = 23 - d. But Equation 7 has c + e. Hmm. Not directly. Alternatively, maybe combine with other equations.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for equations that can be combined. Let's see:\n\nEquation 5a: 2a + g + d = -156.\n\nEquation 8a: a + 2c + g = 157.\n\nIf I can find another equation involving a, c, d, etc., maybe I can solve for variables.\n\nBut perhaps I need to find more equations. Let me check Equation 2: a + 2e + 2f + d + c + g = -33. Let me note that from Equation 3: c + d + e + f =23. Let me see if I can express 2e + 2f in terms of Equation 3.\n\nLet me rearrange Equation 3: e + f = 23 - c - d. So 2e + 2f = 2*(23 - c - d) = 46 - 2c - 2d.\n\nSubstituting into Equation 2:\n\na + (46 - 2c - 2d) + d + c + g = -33 → a + 46 - 2c - 2d + d + c + g = -33 → a + 46 - c - d + g = -33 → a - c - d + g = -79. Let's call this Equation 2a: a - c - d + g = -79.\n\nNow, Equation 5a is 2a + g + d = -156. Let me note Equations 2a and 5a:\n\nEquation 2a: a - c - d + g = -79.\n\nEquation 5a: 2a + g + d = -156.\n\nIf I can find another equation involving a, c, d, g, perhaps I can solve. Let me check Equation 8a: a + 2c + g = 157.\n\nSo, Equations:\n\nEquation 2a: a - c - d + g = -79.\n\nEquation 5a: 2a + g + d = -156.\n\nEquation 8a: a + 2c + g = 157.\n\nLet me try to solve these three equations. Let me denote variables:\n\nLet me write them:\n\nEquation 2a: a - c - d + g = -79 → (1)\n\nEquation 5a: 2a + g + d = -156 → (2)\n\nEquation 8a: a + 2c + g = 157 → (3)\n\nLet me try to solve these. Let me subtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n\nEquation (2) - Equation (1):\n\n(2a + g + d) - (a - c - d + g) = -156 - (-79)\n\nSimplify:\n\n2a + g + d -a + c + d - g = -156 +79 → a + c + 2d = -77. Let's call this Equation 4a: a + c + 2d = -77.\n\nNow, we have Equation 4a and Equation (3). Let me see if I can find another relation.\n\nEquation (3): a + 2c + g = 157.\n\nBut perhaps I need to express variables in terms. Let me try to express variables step by step.\n\nFrom Equation 4a: a = -77 - c - 2d.\n\nSubstitute into Equation 5a: 2a + g + d = -156.\n\nSubstituting a:\n\n2*(-77 - c - 2d) + g + d = -156 → -154 - 2c -4d + g + d = -156 → -154 -2c -3d + g = -156 → -2c -3d + g = -2 → g = 2c + 3d - 2. Let's call this Equation 4b.\n\nNow, substitute a into Equation 8a:\n\na + 2c + g = 157 → (-77 - c - 2d) + 2c + g = 157 → (-77 + c - 2d) + g = 157 → g = 157 +77 - c + 2d → g = 234 - c + 2d. Let's call this Equation 4c.\n\nBut from Equation 4b, g = 2c + 3d - 2. So setting Equation 4b and 4c equal:\n\n2c + 3d - 2 = 234 - c + 2d → 2c + 3d -2 = 234 -c + 2d → 2c + c +3d -2d = 234 +2 → 3c + d = 236. Let's call this Equation 4d: 3c + d = 236.\n\nNow, Equation 4d: 3c + d = 236. Let me keep that in mind.\n\nNow, let's go back to Equation 2a: a - c - d + g = -79. Since we have expressions for a and g in terms of c and d, maybe substitute them here. But perhaps better to use other equations.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for another equation involving c and d. Let's see if we can find more.\n\nLooking back at Equation 3: c + d + e + f =23. Also, Equation 9: b + d + f + g = -69. And Equation 4: 2b + d + f + 2g + 2e = -76.\n\nBut perhaps I can use Equation 4 and Equation 9. Let me see.\n\nEquation 9: b + d + f + g = -69. Let me solve for b: b = -69 -d -f -g. Let me substitute this into Equation 4.\n\nEquation 4: 2b + d + f + 2g + 2e = -76.\n\nSubstitute b:\n\n2*(-69 -d -f -g) + d + f + 2g + 2e = -76 → -138 -2d -2f -2g +d +f +2g +2e = -76 → -138 -d -f + 2e = -76 → -d -f + 2e = 62 → 2e = d + f + 62 → e = (d + f + 62)/2. Let's call this Equation 4e.\n\nNow, from Equation 3: c + d + e + f =23. Substitute e:\n\nc + d + [(d + f + 62)/2] + f = 23 → Multiply all terms by 2 to eliminate denominator:\n\n2c + 2d + d + f + 62 + 2f = 46 → 2c + 3d + 3f +62 =46 → 2c +3d +3f = -16. Let's call this Equation 4f.\n\nHmm. Now, this is getting complicated. Let me see if there's another way. Maybe I need to find expressions for other variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find another equation involving c and d. Let's recall Equation 4d: 3c + d = 236. If I can find another equation with c and d, I can solve for them.\n\nLet me check Equation 4f: 2c +3d +3f = -16. But this has f as well. Maybe I need to find f in terms of other variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use Equation 9 and Equation 4b. Equation 4b: g = 2c + 3d -2. Equation 9: b + d + f + g = -69. But I need expressions for b and f. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps look back at Equation 5a and others. Let me recap:\n\nWe have Equation 4d: 3c + d = 236.\n\nLet me try to find another equation involving c and d. Let me check if there's another equation I can derive.\n\nLooking at Equation 4f: 2c +3d +3f = -16. Let me see if I can express f in terms of other variables. Also, from Equation 3: c + d + e + f =23. And from Equation 4e: e = (d + f + 62)/2. Substitute into Equation 3:\n\nc + d + [(d + f +62)/2] + f =23. Which we already did, leading to Equation 4f. So perhaps not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use Equation 6. Let me check Equation 6: 2a + b + 2c + d + e + g = -48.\n\nWe have expressions for a and g in terms of c and d, and perhaps can express b and e in terms of other variables.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\na = -77 -c -2d (from Equation 4a).\n\ng = 2c + 3d -2 (from Equation 4b).\n\nEquation 6: 2a + b + 2c + d + e + g = -48.\n\nSubstitute a and g:\n\n2*(-77 -c -2d) + b + 2c + d + e + (2c +3d -2) = -48 → -154 -2c -4d + b +2c +d + e +2c +3d -2 = -48 → Simplify:\n\n-154 -2c -4d + b +2c +d + e +2c +3d -2 → Combine like terms:\n\n-154 -2c + 2c + 2c = -154 + 2c.\n\n-4d +d +3d = 0d.\n\nThen, +b + e -2.\n\nSo overall: -154 + 2c + b + e -2 = -48 → 2c + b + e = -48 +154 +2 = 108. So:\n\nEquation 6a: 2c + b + e = 108.\n\nNow, from Equation 4e: e = (d + f + 62)/2.\n\nBut I need to express b and e in terms of variables I can handle. Let me see if I can find expressions for b and e.\n\nFrom Equation 9: b = -69 -d -f -g. And g = 2c +3d -2. So:\n\nb = -69 -d -f - (2c +3d -2) = -69 -d -f -2c -3d +2 = -2c -4d -f -67.\n\nSo, b = -2c -4d -f -67.\n\nNow, substitute into Equation 6a: 2c + b + e = 108.\n\nSo:\n\n2c + (-2c -4d -f -67) + e = 108 → (2c -2c) -4d -f -67 + e = 108 → -4d -f -67 + e = 108 → e = 4d + f + 67 + 108 → e = 4d + f + 175.\n\nBut from Equation 4e: e = (d + f + 62)/2. So:\n\n4d + f + 175 = (d + f + 62)/2 → Multiply both sides by 2:\n\n8d + 2f + 350 = d + f + 62 → 8d -d + 2f -f + 350 -62 = 0 → 7d + f + 288 = 0 → f = -7d -288. Let's call this Equation 4g: f = -7d -288.\n\nNow, substitute f into Equation 4f: 2c +3d +3f = -16.\n\nEquation 4f: 2c +3d +3*(-7d -288) = -16 → 2c +3d -21d -864 = -16 → 2c -18d -864 = -16 → 2c -18d = 848 → c -9d = 424. Let's call this Equation 4h: c = 9d + 424.\n\nNow, we have Equation 4d: 3c + d = 236. Substitute c from Equation 4h into this:\n\n3*(9d + 424) + d = 236 → 27d + 1272 +d = 236 → 28d = 236 - 1272 = -1036 → d = -1036 / 28 → Let me compute that.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 4: -259 / 7 → -37. So 7*37 = 259. So yes, d = -37.\n\nWait, 28d = -1036 → d = -1036 / 28. Let me compute:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 4: 1036 ÷4=259, 28 ÷4=7. So d = -259/7. Wait, that's -37. Because 7*37=259. Yes. So d = -37.\n\nNow, with d = -37, we can find c from Equation 4h: c = 9d + 424 = 9*(-37) + 424 = -333 + 424 = 91. So c = 91.\n\nNow, with d = -37 and c =91, let's find other variables.\n\nFrom Equation 4g: f = -7d -288 = -7*(-37) -288 = 259 -288 = -29. So f = -29.\n\nNow, from Equation 4d: 3c +d = 3*91 + (-37) = 273 -37 = 236, which matches Equation 4d. Good.\n\nNow, let's find g from Equation 4b: g = 2c +3d -2 = 2*91 +3*(-37) -2 = 182 -111 -2 = 69. So g = 69.\n\nNow, from Equation 9: b + d + f + g = -69. We can find b.\n\nb = -69 -d -f -g = -69 - (-37) - (-29) -69 = -69 +37 +29 -69. Let's compute:\n\n-69 -69 = -138; 37 +29 = 66. So total is -138 +66 = -72. So b = -72.\n\nNow, from Equation 4a: a = -77 -c -2d = -77 -91 -2*(-37) = -77 -91 +74 = (-77 -91) +74 = -168 +74 = -94. So a = -94.\n\nNow, from Equation 4e: e = (d + f +62)/2 = (-37 + (-29) +62)/2 = (-66 +62)/2 = (-4)/2 = -2. So e = -2.\n\nLet me verify these values with other equations to check for consistency.\n\nCheck Equation 1: a + 2b + 3c + d + e = -4.\n\na = -94, b=-72, c=91, d=-37, e=-2.\n\nCompute:\n\n-94 + 2*(-72) +3*91 + (-37) + (-2) = -94 -144 +273 -37 -2.\n\nCalculate step by step:\n\n-94 -144 = -238; +273: 35; -37: -2; -2: -4.

Which matches. Good.\n\nCheck Equation 3: c + d + e + f = 91 + (-37) + (-2) + (-29) = 91 -37 =54; 54-2=52; 52-29=23.

Correct.\n\nCheck Equation 7: a + 2b + c + d + e + 2g = -94 + 2*(-72) +91 + (-37) + (-2) + 2*69.\n\nCalculate:\n\n-94 -144 = -238; +91 = -147; -37 = -184; -2 = -186; +138 = -48. Which matches Equation 7's -48. Correct.\n\nCheck Equation 8: a + b + 2c + d + f + 2g = -94 + (-72) + 2*91 + (-37) + (-29) + 2*69.\n\nCompute:\n\n-94 -72 = -166; +182 = 16; -37 = -21; -29 = -50; +138 = 88. Which matches Equation 8's 88. Correct.\n\nCheck Equation 9: d + f + b + g = -37 + (-29) + (-72) +69 = -37-29= -66; -66-72=-138; +69= -69. Correct.\n\nAll equations are satisfied. Great!

      "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, I have a grid of symbols, each representing a numerical value. The rows have their sums given, and I need to find the column sums. Hmm. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what each symbol stands for. But wait, there are multiple symbols here: ♠, ⊥, ∂, &, #, $, !, and maybe others. But how do I determine their numerical values? The rows' sums are provided, so maybe I can set up equations based on the symbols in each row and their total.\n\nLet me start by listing each row's symbols and their corresponding sum. For example, the first row is \"♠⊥∂&&⊥♠♠\" with a sum of 444. Let me count how many times each symbol appears in each row. Maybe if I can create a system of equations, I can solve for each symbol's value.\n\nBut there are 10 rows and multiple symbols. That could get complicated. Let me see if there's a pattern or if some rows can be simplified. Let's note down each row's symbols and their counts.\n\nLet me assign variables to each symbol. Let's say:\n\n- ♠ = a\n- ⊥ = b\n- ∂ = c\n- & = d\n- # = e\n- $ = f\n- ! = g\n- = h (Wait, the symbols are: looking at the grid, the symbols are ♠, ⊥, ∂, &, #, $, !. Let me confirm each symbol. Let me list them all:\n\nLooking at the grid rows:\n\nRow 1: ♠, ⊥, ∂, &, &, ⊥, ♠, ♠ → symbols are a, b, c, d, d, b, a, a. So total for row 1: 3a + 2b + 1c + 2d = 444.\n\nSimilarly, row 2: ∂∂$#&♠⊥& → symbols are c, c, f, e, d, a, b, d → 1a + 1b + 2c + 2d + 1e + 1f = 247.\n\nHmm. So each row gives an equation with coefficients based on the count of each symbol. If I can create equations for all 10 rows, I can solve for the variables a, b, c, d, e, f, g (Wait, there's also ! which is g. Let me check the symbols again. The symbols present are:\n\nLooking through the grid:\n\nFirst row: ♠, ⊥, ∂, &, &, ⊥, ♠, ♠ → symbols a, b, c, d.\n\nSecond row: ∂∂$#&♠⊥& → symbols c, f, e, d, a, b, d. Also includes $ (f), # (e), & (d), etc.\n\nThird row: ♠!&∂♠⊥!⊥ → symbols a, g, d, c, a, b, g, b. So symbols a, b, c, d, g.\n\nFourth row: $#♠!!∂$♠ → e, f, a, g, g, c, f, a. So a, e, f, g, c.\n\nFifth row: !♠∂#!!♠∂ → g, a, c, e, g, g, a, c. So a, c, e, g.\n\nSixth row: !∂#♠$⊥#⊥ → g, c, e, a, f, b, e, b. So a, b, c, e, f, g.\n\nSeventh row: ⊥&⊥!!$♠! → b, d, b, g, g, f, a, g. So a, b, d, f, g.\n\nEighth row: #∂$&⊥#♠# → e, c, f, d, b, e, a, e. So a, b, c, d, e, f.\n\nNinth row: !&#♠$⊥#& → g, d, e, a, f, b, e, d. So a, b, d, e, f, g.\n\nTenth row: $!$⊥#$⊥# → f, g, f, b, e, f, b, e. So b, e, f, g.\n\nSo all symbols are: a(♠), b(⊥), c(∂), d(&), e(#), f($), g(!). That's seven symbols. So seven variables. But we have ten equations from the rows. That should be enough to solve the system.\n\nLet me write each row's equation.\n\nRow 1: 3a + 2b + 1c + 2d = 444.\n\nRow 2: 1a + 1b + 2c + 2d + 1e + 1f = 247.\n\nRow 3: 2a + 2b + 1c + 1d + 2g = 431.\n\nRow 4: 2a + 1c + 1e + 2f + 2g = 193.\n\nRow 5: 2a + 2c + 3e + 3g = 471. Wait, let me recount:\n\nFifth row: !♠∂#!!♠∂ → symbols are g, a, c, e, g, g, a, c. So:\n\na appears 2 times, c appears 2 times, e appears 1, g appears 3. Wait, fifth row: symbols are:\n\n! (g), ♠ (a), ∂ (c), # (e), ! (g), ! (g), ♠ (a), ∂ (c). So:\n\na: 2, c: 2, e: 1, g: 3. So equation: 2a + 2c + 1e + 3g = 471.\n\nRow 6: !∂#♠$⊥#⊥ → symbols g, c, e, a, f, b, e, b. So:\n\na:1, b:2, c:1, e:2, f:1, g:1. Equation: 1a + 2b + 1c + 2e + 1f + 1g = -38.\n\nRow 7: ⊥&⊥!!$♠! → symbols b, d, b, g, g, f, a, g. So:\n\na:1, b:2, d:1, f:1, g:3. Equation: 1a + 2b + 1d + 1f + 3g = 295.\n\nRow 8: #∂$&⊥#♠# → symbols e, c, f, d, b, e, a, e. So:\n\na:1, b:1, c:1, d:1, e:3, f:1. Equation: 1a + 1b + 1c + 1d + 3e + 1f = -74.\n\nRow 9: !&#♠$⊥#& → symbols g, d, e, a, f, b, e, d. So:\n\na:1, b:1, d:2, e:2, f:1, g:1. Equation: 1a + 1b + 2d + 2e + 1f + 1g = 102.\n\nRow 10: $!$⊥#$⊥# → symbols f, g, f, b, e, f, b, e. So:\n\nf:3, g:1, b:2, e:2. Equation: 3f + 1g + 2b + 2e = -316.\n\nSo now, we have ten equations with seven variables. Let me list them again:\n\nEquation 1: 3a + 2b + c + 2d = 444.\n\nEquation 2: a + b + 2c + 2d + e + f = 247.\n\nEquation 3: 2a + 2b + c + d + 2g = 431.\n\nEquation 4: 2a + c + e + 2f + 2g = 193.\n\nEquation 5: 2a + 2c + e + 3g = 471.\n\nEquation 6: a + 2b + c + 2e + f + g = -38.\n\nEquation 7: a + 2b + d + f + 3g = 295.\n\nEquation 8: a + b + c + d + 3e + f = -74.\n\nEquation 9: a + b + 2d + 2e + f + g = 102.\n\nEquation 10: 3f + g + 2b + 2e = -316.\n\nThis seems complex, but maybe we can solve step by step. Let's see if we can find substitutions or express variables in terms of others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use some equations to eliminate variables.\n\nFirst, let me check if there are equations with fewer variables. For example, equation 1 has a, b, c, d. Equation 3 has a, b, c, d, g. Equation 2 has a, b, c, d, e, f. Maybe we can find relations between them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find equations that can be subtracted from each other.\n\nBut this might take a while. Let me see if there's another approach. Since there are seven variables, perhaps we can pick seven equations and solve them. Let's try selecting equations that are simpler.\n\nLet me start with equation 5: 2a + 2c + e + 3g = 471. Maybe we can express e in terms of others here.\n\nEquation 5: e = 471 - 2a - 2c - 3g. Let's note that.\n\nEquation 4: 2a + c + e + 2f + 2g = 193. If we substitute e from equation 5 into equation 4:\n\n2a + c + [471 - 2a - 2c - 3g] + 2f + 2g = 193.\n\nSimplify:\n\n2a -2a + c -2c + 471 -3g +2g + 2f = 193.\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n- c - g + 471 + 2f = 193.\n\nRearranged: 2f - c - g = 193 - 471 = -278 → 2f - c - g = -278 → equation (A).\n\nLet me keep that in mind.\n\nEquation 6: a + 2b + c + 2e + f + g = -38. Let's substitute e from equation 5 here.\n\nSo:\n\na + 2b + c + 2*(471 -2a -2c -3g) + f + g = -38.\n\nExpanding:\n\na + 2b + c + 942 -4a -4c -6g + f + g = -38.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(a -4a) + 2b + (c -4c) + ( -6g + g) + f + 942 = -38.\n\n-3a + 2b -3c -5g + f + 942 = -38.\n\nRearranged:\n\n-3a + 2b -3c -5g + f = -38 -942 = -980 → equation (B).\n\nEquation 7: a + 2b + d + f + 3g = 295. Let's note that.\n\nEquation 8: a + b + c + d + 3e + f = -74. Substitute e from equation 5:\n\na + b + c + d + 3*(471 -2a -2c -3g) + f = -74.\n\nExpand:\n\na + b + c + d + 1413 -6a -6c -9g + f = -74.\n\nCombine:\n\n( a -6a ) + b + (c -6c) + d + f -9g + 1413 = -74.\n\n-5a + b -5c + d + f -9g = -74 -1413 = -1487 → equation (C).\n\nEquation 9: a + b + 2d + 2e + f + g = 102.

Let's note that.\n\nEquation (B1): -6a +4b -5c -9g = -1682. Wait, equation (B1) is -6a +4b -5c -9g = -1682, and equation (E1) is -8a +4b -5c -7g = -1682. Interesting. Let me subtract equation (B1) from equation (E1):\n\n(E1) - (B1):\n\n(-8a +4b -5c -7g) - (-6a +4b -5c -9g) = (-1682) - (-1682).\n\nLeft side:\n\n-8a +4b -5c -7g +6a -4b +5c +9g = (-2a) + 2g.\n\nRight side: 0.\n\nSo: -2a + 2g = 0 → -2a +2g = 0 → -a +g =0 → g = a. So equation (G): g = a.\n\nThis is a useful relation. So g equals a.\n\nNow, since g = a, we can substitute g with a in all equations.\n\nLet me do that.\n\nFirst, equation (A1): f = (c + g -278)/2 → f = (c + a -278)/2.\n\nEquation (G): g = a.\n\nNow, let's substitute g = a into other equations.\n\nEquation (B1): -6a +4b -5c -9g = -1682 → -6a +4b -5c -9a = -1682 → -15a +4b -5c = -1682 → equation (B2).\n\nEquation (C1): -10a +2b -9c +2d -17g = -2696 → -10a +2b -9c +2d -17a = -2696 → -27a +2b -9c +2d = -2696 → equation (C2).\n\nEquation (D1): -6a +2b -7c +4d -9g = -1402 → -6a +2b -7c +4d -9a = -1402 → -15a +2b -7c +4d = -1402 → equation (D2).\n\nEquation (E1): already used to find g = a.\n\nEquation (F1): -2a +2b +c +4d -5g = -170 → -2a +2b +c +4d -5a = -170 → -7a +2b +c +4d = -170 → equation (F2).\n\nEquation (1): 3a + 2b + c + 2d = 444 → equation (1).\n\nEquation (3): 2a + 2b + c + d + 2g = 431 → 2a +2b +c +d +2a = 431 → 4a +2b +c +d = 431 → equation (3a).\n\nNow, let's proceed with these equations.\n\nLet me list the current equations:\n\nEquation (B2): -15a +4b -5c = -1682.\n\nEquation (C2): -27a +2b -9c +2d = -2696.\n\nEquation (D2): -15a +2b -7c +4d = -1402.\n\nEquation (F2): -7a +2b +c +4d = -170.\n\nEquation (1): 3a +2b +c +2d = 444.\n\nEquation (3a): 4a +2b +c +d = 431.\n\nNow, let's see how to solve these equations.\n\nFirst, perhaps we can use equations (1) and (3a) to eliminate variables.\n\nEquation (1): 3a +2b +c +2d = 444.\n\nEquation (3a): 4a +2b +c +d = 431.\n\nLet me subtract equation (3a) from equation (1):\n\n(3a +2b +c +2d) - (4a +2b +c +d) = 444 - 431.\n\nLeft side: -a +d = 13 → d = a +13. Equation (H).\n\nSo d = a +13. Now we can substitute d in other equations.\n\nLet me substitute d = a +13 into equations (C2), (D2), (F2), and equation (3a).\n\nFirst, equation (3a): 4a +2b +c +d = 431. Since d = a +13, substituting:\n\n4a +2b +c +a +13 = 431 → 5a +2b +c = 431 -13 = 418 → equation (3b): 5a +2b +c = 418.\n\nEquation (1): 3a +2b +c +2d = 444. With d = a+13:\n\n3a +2b +c +2(a+13) = 3a +2b +c +2a +26 = 5a +2b +c +26 = 444 → 5a +2b +c = 444 -26 = 418. Which matches equation (3b). So equations (1) and (3a) are consistent, giving us d = a+13 and 5a +2b +c =418.\n\nNow, let's proceed to other equations.\n\nEquation (B2): -15a +4b -5c = -1682.\n\nEquation (3b): 5a +2b +c = 418. Let me solve equation (3b) for c: c = 418 -5a -2b. Let's call this equation (I).\n\nNow, substitute c = 418 -5a -2b into equation (B2):\n\n-15a +4b -5*(418 -5a -2b) = -1682.\n\nCalculate:\n\n-15a +4b -2090 +25a +10b = -1682.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n( -15a +25a ) + (4b +10b) -2090 = 10a +14b -2090 = -1682.\n\nSo:\n\n10a +14b = -1682 +2090 = 408 → divide both sides by 2: 5a +7b = 204 → equation (J).\n\nNow, equation (J): 5a +7b = 204.\n\nNow, let's substitute c from equation (I) into other equations.\n\nEquation (C2): -27a +2b -9c +2d = -2696. With d = a+13 and c = 418 -5a -2b:\n\n-27a +2b -9*(418 -5a -2b) +2*(a+13) = -2696.\n\nCalculate:\n\n-27a +2b - 3762 +45a +18b +2a +26 = -2696.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-27a +45a +2a) + (2b +18b) + (-3762 +26) = 20a +20b -3736 = -2696.\n\nSo:\n\n20a +20b = -2696 +3736 = 1040 → divide by 20: a +b = 52 → equation (K): a +b =52.\n\nEquation (K): a +b =52. Let's keep this.\n\nEquation (J): 5a +7b =204.\n\nWe can solve equations (J) and (K) together.\n\nFrom equation (K): b =52 -a.\n\nSubstitute into equation (J):\n\n5a +7*(52 -a) = 204 → 5a + 364 -7a = 204 → -2a +364 =204 → -2a = 204 -364 = -160 → a= (-160)/(-2)=80.\n\nSo a=80. Then from equation (K): b=52 -80= -28.\n\nSo a=80, b=-28.\n\nNow, with a=80, we can find other variables.\n\nFrom equation (I): c =418 -5a -2b = 418 -5*80 -2*(-28) = 418 -400 +56 = 74.\n\nSo c=74.\n\nFrom equation (H): d =a+13=80+13=93.\n\nFrom equation (G): g=a=80.\n\nNow, from equation (A1): f = (c +a -278)/2 = (74 +80 -278)/2 = (154 -278)/2 = (-124)/2= -62.\n\nSo f=-62.\n\nNow, we need to find e from equation (5): e=471 -2a -2c -3g.\n\nSubstitute a=80, c=74, g=80:\n\ne=471 -2*80 -2*74 -3*80 = 471 -160 -148 -240 = 471 - (160+148+240) = 471 - 548 = -77.\n\nSo e=-77.\n\nNow, we have all variables:\n\na=80 (♠), b=-28 (⊥), c=74 (∂), d=93 (&), e=-77 (#), f=-62 ($), g=80 (!).\n\nNow, let's verify if these values satisfy other equations, to check for errors.\n\nLet me check equation (2): original equation 2: a + b + 2c + 2d + e + f = 247.\n\nSubstitute values:\n\n80 + (-28) + 2*74 + 2*93 + (-77) + (-62) = ?\n\nCalculate step by step:\n\n80 -28 =52\n\n52 + 148 (2*74) = 200\n\n200 + 186 (2*93) = 386\n\n386 -77 = 309\n\n309 -62 = 247.

Great, so the values are correct.\n\nNow, with all symbols' values known, we need to compute the column sums.\n\nThe grid has 8 columns (since each row has 8 symbols).

      "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, I need to find the sum of each column in this grid based on the given row sums. Hmm. Let me think.\n\nFirst, the grid has 8 rows and each row has 7 symbols. Each symbol represents a numerical value. The rightmost number in each row is the sum of that row's symbols. My job is to compute the column sums and output them as a list.\n\nWait, how do I approach this? Since each row's sum is given, maybe I can use that to find individual symbol values? But there are multiple symbols, so maybe some symbols have the same value? Like if the same symbol appears in different rows, their values would contribute to different row sums. But with 7 symbols per row and 8 rows, there's probably a system of equations here. However, solving for each symbol's value individually might be complicated. Maybe there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, since the column sums are required, maybe I can add up all the row sums and then divide by the number of rows? Wait, no. Because each column's sum is the sum of each element in that column across all rows. The total of all row sums equals the total of all column sums. But since there are 8 rows, the total sum would be the sum of the row totals. Let me check that.\n\nLet me calculate the total sum first. Let's add up all the row sums:\n\n123 + (-97) + 82 + (-248) + (-274) + 129 + 29 + 119.\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\nStart with 123 -97 = 26.\n\n26 +82 = 108.\n\n108 -248 = -140.\n\n-140 -274 = -414.\n\n-414 +129 = -285.\n\n-285 +29 = -256.\n\n-256 +119 = -137.\n\nSo the total sum of all elements is -137. Since there are 7 columns, if we could find each column sum, their total would be -137. But how do I find each individual column sum?\n\nBut without knowing individual symbol values, how can I compute column sums? Maybe there's another approach. Wait, maybe each column's sum can be derived by considering the sum of each position across all rows. For example, the first column is the first symbol in each row. If I can find the sum of all those first symbols, that's the first column sum. Similarly for other columns.\n\nBut how do I find the sum for each column position? Since each row's sum is given, maybe I can look at each column's contribution. Let me think: Each row's sum is the sum of its seven symbols. So if I consider all eight rows, each column's total is the sum of that position's symbols across all rows.\n\nBut how can I get that? Well, if I take all the row sums and add them up, that's the sum of all symbols in the grid. Which we already found to be -137. But how does that help me find individual column sums?\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a pattern in the symbols. For example, if certain symbols appear in specific columns consistently, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to set up equations for each column sum. Let me think. Let me denote the columns as C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7. Each Ci is the sum of the ith symbol in each row.\n\nOur goal is to find [C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7].\n\nWe know that C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5 + C6 + C7 = -137.\n\nBut how to find each Ci?\n\nLooking at the grid, maybe each row's sum can be expressed in terms of the symbols in that row. But since symbols are repeated, perhaps each row's sum is a combination of different symbols. However, without knowing the individual symbol values, this seems tricky.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to find each column sum by considering how many times each symbol appears in each column. For example, if a certain symbol appears in column 1 in all rows, then its total contribution to C1 would be (number of rows) multiplied by its value. But since symbols can vary per row and column, this might not help unless we can find relations between them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a trick here. Since each row's sum is given, and each column's sum is needed, maybe we can think of each column's sum as the sum of each position's contribution. But again, without knowing individual values, this seems challenging.\n\nWait a second. Maybe the problem is designed in such a way that each column's sum can be determined by looking at the positions. For example, if each column has a unique pattern that allows us to compute their sum based on the row sums. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to realize that each column's sum can be found by considering the sum of the elements in that column across all rows. Since each row's sum is given, perhaps I can find the sum of each column by looking at how the symbols are arranged. But I'm stuck here.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem gives me a grid where each row's sum is provided. The symbols are the same across the grid, meaning that the same symbol has the same value wherever it appears. Therefore, if I can find the value of each symbol, I can compute the column sums by adding up the symbols in each column.\n\nBut how to find the symbol values? Let's see. There are multiple symbols: ⊗, ^, ↑, ⊥, ≤, ♦, and maybe others? Let me check the grid again.\n\nLooking at the grid:\n\nFirst row: ⊗^↑^⊥⊗^ → symbols are ⊗, ^, ↑, ^, ⊥, ⊗, ^. So symbols are ⊗, ^, ↑, ⊥.\n\nSecond row: ↑≤♦↑♦↑⊥ → symbols ↑, ≤, ♦, ↑, ♦, ↑, ⊥. So symbols ↑, ≤, ♦, ⊥.\n\nThird row: ^↑⊥^⊗♦⊗ → ^, ↑, ⊥, ^, ⊗, ♦, ⊗. Symbols ^, ↑, ⊥, ⊗, ♦.\n\nFourth row: ≤⊥⊥⊥⊗^↑ → ≤, ⊥, ⊥, ⊥, ⊗, ^, ↑. Symbols ≤, ⊥, ⊗, ^, ↑.\n\nFifth row: ⊥≤≤⊥⊗≤↑ → ⊥, ≤, ≤, ⊥, ⊗, ≤, ↑. Symbols ⊥, ≤, ⊗, ↑.\n\nSixth row: ^♦^^↑⊗⊥ → ^, ♦, ^, ^, ↑, ⊗, ⊥. Symbols ^, ♦, ↑, ⊗, ⊥.\n\nSeventh row: ^↑^⊥≤^≤ → ^, ↑, ^, ⊥, ≤, ^, ≤. Symbols ^, ↑, ⊥, ≤.\n\nEighth row: ⊗^≤≤^≤^ → ⊗, ^, ≤, ≤, ^, ≤, ^. Symbols ⊗, ^, ≤.\n\nSo the symbols present are: ⊗, ^, ↑, ⊥, ≤, ♦. Let me count them. Yes, those six symbols. Let me note their possible equations.\n\nEach row's sum is given. Let me try to write equations for each row based on their symbols.\n\nLet me assign variables to each symbol:\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet A = ⊗\n\nB = ^\n\nC = ↑\n\nD = ⊥\n\nE = ≤\n\nF = ♦\n\nNow, each row can be written as an equation.\n\nFirst row: A + B + C + B + D + A + B = 123 → 2A + 3B + C + D = 123.\n\nSecond row: C + E + F + C + F + C + D = -97 → 3C + E + 2F + D = -97.\n\nThird row: B + C + D + B + A + F + A = 82 → 2A + 2B + C + D + F = 82.\n\nFourth row: E + D + D + D + A + B + C = -248 → A + B + C + E + 3D = -248.\n\nFifth row: D + E + E + D + A + E + C = -274 → A + C + 2D + 3E = -274.\n\nSixth row: B + F + B + B + C + A + D = 129 → A + 3B + C + D + F = 129.\n\nSeventh row: B + C + B + D + E + B + E = 29 → 3B + C + D + 2E = 29.\n\nEighth row: A + B + E + E + B + E + B = 119 → A + 3B + 3E = 119.\n\nSo now, we have 8 equations with 6 variables. Wait, but there are 8 equations and 6 variables. That might be overdetermined. Let me check if the equations are consistent.\n\nLet me list them again:\n\n1. 2A + 3B + C + D = 123 → Eq1\n\n2. 3C + E + 2F + D = -97 → Eq2\n\n3. 2A + 2B + C + D + F = 82 → Eq3\n\n4. A + B + C + E + 3D = -248 → Eq4\n\n5. A + C + 2D + 3E = -274 → Eq5\n\n6. A + 3B + C + D + F = 129 → Eq6\n\n7. 3B + C + D + 2E = 29 → Eq7\n\n8. A + 3B + 3E = 119 → Eq8\n\nHmm, solving this system might be complex, but let's try.\n\nFirst, note that equations 1, 3, 6 involve A, B, C, D, F.\n\nEquations 2 involves C, D, E, F.\n\nEquations 4,5,7,8 involve A, B, C, D, E.\n\nLet me see if I can express variables in terms of others.\n\nFrom Eq1 and Eq3 and Eq6.\n\nLet me first look at equations 1 and 3.\n\nEq1: 2A + 3B + C + D = 123.\n\nEq3: 2A + 2B + C + D + F = 82.\n\nIf I subtract Eq1 from Eq3, I get:\n\n(2A + 2B + C + D + F) - (2A + 3B + C + D) = 82 - 123 → -B + F = -41 → F = B -41. Let's note that as F = B -41. (EqA)\n\nSimilarly, compare Eq3 and Eq6.\n\nEq3: 2A + 2B + C + D + F = 82.\n\nEq6: A + 3B + C + D + F = 129.\n\nSubtracting Eq6 from Eq3:\n\n(2A + 2B + ...) - (A + 3B + ...) = 82 - 129 → A - B = -47 → A = B -47. (EqB)\n\nNow, from EqB, A = B -47. Let's substitute this into other equations.\n\nLet me look at Eq8: A + 3B + 3E = 119. Substituting A:\n\n(B -47) + 3B + 3E = 119 → 4B + 3E = 166 → 4B + 3E = 166. Let's call this Eq8a.\n\nNow, let's look at Eq7: 3B + C + D + 2E = 29. Let's keep that aside for now.\n\nLet me also look at Eq4: A + B + C + E + 3D = -248. Substituting A = B -47:\n\n(B -47) + B + C + E + 3D = -248 → 2B -47 + C + E + 3D = -248 → 2B + C + E + 3D = -201. Let's call this Eq4a.\n\nSimilarly, Eq5: A + C + 2D + 3E = -274. Substitute A:\n\n(B -47) + C + 2D + 3E = -274 → B -47 + C + 2D + 3E = -274 → B + C + 2D + 3E = -227. Let's call this Eq5a.\n\nNow, let's look at Eq1: 2A + 3B + C + D = 123. Substitute A:\n\n2*(B -47) + 3B + C + D = 123 → 2B -94 + 3B + C + D = 123 → 5B + C + D = 217. Let's call this Eq1a.\n\nNow, let's look at Eq3: 2A + 2B + C + D + F = 82. We already used this to get F = B -41. But maybe we can use Eq1a and others.\n\nAlso, from EqA, F = B -41. Let's look at Eq2: 3C + E + 2F + D = -97. Substitute F:\n\n3C + E + 2*(B -41) + D = -97 → 3C + E + 2B -82 + D = -97 → 2B + D + 3C + E = -15. Let's call this Eq2a.\n\nNow, let's see what equations we have:\n\nEq1a: 5B + C + D = 217.\n\nEq2a: 2B + D + 3C + E = -15.\n\nEq4a: 2B + C + E + 3D = -201.\n\nEq5a: B + C + 2D + 3E = -227.\n\nEq7: 3B + C + D + 2E = 29.\n\nEq8a: 4B + 3E = 166.\n\nThis is getting complicated, but maybe we can find relations.\n\nLet me see if I can express variables in terms of others. Let's see.\n\nFirst, from Eq8a: 4B + 3E = 166 → Let's solve for E: 3E = 166 -4B → E = (166 -4B)/3. Let's note this as Eq8b.\n\nNow, substitute E into other equations.\n\nLet's substitute E into Eq2a: 2B + D + 3C + [(166 -4B)/3] = -15.\n\nMultiply all terms by 3 to eliminate denominator:\n\n6B + 3D + 9C + 166 -4B = -45 → (6B -4B) + 3D + 9C + 166 = -45 → 2B + 3D + 9C = -45 -166 = -211. Let's call this Eq2b.\n\nSimilarly, substitute E into Eq4a: 2B + C + [(166 -4B)/3] + 3D = -201.\n\nMultiply by 3:\n\n6B + 3C + 166 -4B + 9D = -603 → 2B + 3C +9D = -603 -166 = -769. Let's call this Eq4b.\n\nNow, substitute E into Eq5a: B + C + 2D + 3*[(166 -4B)/3] = -227 → B + C + 2D + 166 -4B = -227 → -3B + C + 2D = -227 -166 = -393. Let's call this Eq5b.\n\nSubstitute E into Eq7: 3B + C + D + 2*[(166 -4B)/3] = 29.\n\nMultiply by 3:\n\n9B + 3C + 3D + 2*(166 -4B) = 87 → 9B +3C +3D + 332 -8B = 87 → B + 3C + 3D = 87 -332 = -245. Let's call this Eq7a.\n\nNow, our equations are:\n\nEq1a: 5B + C + D = 217.\n\nEq2b: 2B + 3D + 9C = -211.\n\nEq4b: 2B + 3C +9D = -769.\n\nEq5b: -3B + C + 2D = -393.\n\nEq7a: B + 3C + 3D = -245.\n\nThis seems manageable. Let's see if we can solve these equations.\n\nLet me consider Eq1a: 5B + C + D = 217. Let's solve for, say, C + D = 217 -5B. Let's call this Eq1b.\n\nNow, let's look at Eq7a: B + 3C +3D = -245. Substitute C + D from Eq1b:\n\nC + D = 217 -5B → 3C + 3D = 3*(217 -5B) = 651 -15B.\n\nSo Eq7a becomes: B + 651 -15B = -245 → -14B + 651 = -245 → -14B = -245 -651 = -896 → B = (-896)/(-14) = 64.\n\nSo B = 64. Great! Now we can find other variables.\n\nNow that we have B=64, let's find E from Eq8b: E = (166 -4*64)/3 = (166 -256)/3 = (-90)/3 = -30. So E = -30.\n\nNow, from EqB: A = B -47 = 64 -47 = 17. So A = 17.\n\nFrom EqA: F = B -41 = 64 -41 = 23. So F=23.\n\nNow, let's find C + D from Eq1b: C + D = 217 -5B = 217 -5*64 = 217 - 320 = -103. So C + D = -103. Let's call this EqC.\n\nNow, let's look at Eq5b: -3B + C + 2D = -393. Substituting B=64:\n\n-3*64 + C + 2D = -192 + C + 2D = -393 → C + 2D = -393 +192 = -201. Let's call this Eq5c.\n\nWe have from EqC: C + D = -103. Let's subtract EqC from Eq5c:\n\n(C + 2D) - (C + D) = -201 - (-103) → D = -98.\n\nSo D = -98. Then from EqC: C = -103 - D = -103 - (-98) = -103 +98 = -5. So C = -5.\n\nNow we have C=-5 and D=-98.\n\nLet me check if these values satisfy other equations.\n\nLet's check Eq2b: 2B + 3D +9C = -211. Substituting B=64, D=-98, C=-5:\n\n2*64 + 3*(-98) +9*(-5) = 128 -294 -45 = 128 - 339 = -211. Correct.\n\nCheck Eq4b: 2B + 3C +9D = -769.\n\n2*64 + 3*(-5) +9*(-98) = 128 -15 -882 = 128 - 897 = -769. Correct.\n\nCheck Eq7a: B +3C +3D = 64 +3*(-5) +3*(-98) = 64 -15 -294 = 64 - 309 = -245. Correct.\n\nGreat! Now we have all variables:\n\nA=17 (⊗), B=64 (^), C=-5 (↑), D=-98 (⊥), E=-30 (≤), F=23 (♦).\n\nNow, with these values, we can compute each column's sum.\n\nThe columns are columns 1 to 7. For each column, we need to sum the value of the symbol in that position across all 8 rows.\n\nLet me go through each column one by one.\n\nFirst, let me list each row's symbols in each column.

      "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a grid with symbols in each cell, and each row's sum is given. Our task is to find the sum of each column and output that as a list. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out what numerical values each symbol represents. The symbols I see are ^, ∅, ≈, ∑. Let's denote each symbol as a variable. Let me assign:\n\nLet’s say:\n- ^ = A\n- ∅ = B\n- ≈ = C\n- ∑ = D\n\nEach row in the grid has these symbols, and the sum of each row is provided. There are five rows. Let me list each row's symbols and their corresponding sum.\n\nRow 1: ^ ∅ ∅ ^ ∑ ∅ → A B B A D B → Sum is 215\nRow 2: ^ ≈ ^ ∑ ≈ ∅ → A C A D C B → Sum is -141\nRow 3: ≈ ∑ ^ ∅ ^ ^ → C D A B A A → Sum is -20\nRow 4: ^ ≈ ∑ ^ ∑ ^ → A C D A D A → Sum is -195\nRow 5: ^ ∅ ≈ ≈ ∑ ∅ → A B C C D B → Sum is -84\n\nSo now we have five equations:\n\n1. A + B + B + A + D + B = 2A + 3B + D = 215\n2. A + C + A + D + C + B = 2A + 2C + D + B = -141\nWait, wait. Let me check the symbols again. Row 2's symbols are ^ ≈ ^ ∑ ≈ ∅. So that's A, C, A, D, C, B. So sum is A + C + A + D + C + B → 2A + 2C + B + D = -141. Correct.\n\nEquation 2: 2A + 2C + B + D = -141.\n\nEquation 3: C + D + A + B + A + A → C + D + 3A + B = -20. So 3A + B + C + D = -20.\n\nEquation 4: A + C + D + A + D + A → 3A + C + 2D = -195. Wait, row 4's symbols are ^ ≈ ∑ ^ ∑ ^. So A, C, D, A, D, A. Sum is A + C + D + A + D + A = 3A + C + 2D. So equation 4: 3A + C + 2D = -195.\n\nEquation 5: A + B + C + C + D + B → A + 2B + 2C + D = -84. So equation 5: A + 2B + 2C + D = -84.\n\nNow, we have five equations:\n\n1. 2A + 3B + D = 215 → (1)\n2. 2A + B + 2C + D = -141 → (2)\n3. 3A + B + C + D = -20 → (3)\n4. 3A + C + 2D = -195 → (4)\n5. A + 2B + 2C + D = -84 → (5)\n\nWe need to solve these equations to find A, B, C, D.\n\nLet me write them again:\n\nEquation 1: 2A + 3B + D = 215\nEquation 2: 2A + B + 2C + D = -141\nEquation 3: 3A + B + C + D = -20\nEquation 4: 3A + C + 2D = -195\nEquation 5: A + 2B + 2C + D = -84\n\nHmm, this is a system of equations with four variables (A, B, C, D) but five equations. So there might be some redundancy or maybe the equations are consistent. Let's try solving them step by step.\n\nFirst, let me try to express variables in terms of others. Let's see.\n\nFrom equation 3: 3A + B + C + D = -20 → Let's call this equation (3).\n\nFrom equation 4: 3A + C + 2D = -195 → equation (4).\n\nIf we subtract equation (3) from equation (4), we get:\n\n(3A + C + 2D) - (3A + B + C + D) = -195 - (-20)\n\nSimplify left side: 3A -3A + C - C + 2D - D - B = -B + D.\n\nRight side: -195 +20 = -175.\n\nSo -B + D = -175 → D - B = -175 → D = B - 175. Let's note this as equation (6).\n\nNow, equation (6): D = B - 175.\n\nLet me substitute D in other equations. Let's take equation (1):\n\nEquation 1: 2A + 3B + D = 215. Substitute D with B -175:\n\n2A + 3B + (B -175) = 215 → 2A +4B -175 = 215 → 2A +4B = 215 +175 → 2A +4B = 390 → Divide by 2: A + 2B = 195 → equation (1a): A = 195 - 2B.\n\nNow equation (1a): A = 195 - 2B.\n\nNow equation (2): 2A + B + 2C + D = -141. Substitute D with B-175 and A with 195-2B.\n\nLet me compute:\n\n2*(195-2B) + B + 2C + (B -175) = -141.\n\nCompute 2*195 is 390, 2*(-2B) is -4B. So:\n\n390 -4B + B + 2C + B -175 = -141.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(390 -175) + (-4B + B + B) + 2C = -141.\n\n390-175 is 215. The B terms: -4B + B + B = -2B. So:\n\n215 -2B + 2C = -141 → -2B + 2C = -141 -215 → -2B + 2C = -356 → divide both sides by 2: -B + C = -178 → C = B - 178. Let's call this equation (7).\n\nEquation (7): C = B - 178.\n\nNow let's use equation (3): 3A + B + C + D = -20. Substitute A, C, D in terms of B.\n\nA is 195 - 2B.\n\nC is B -178.\n\nD is B -175.\n\nSo:\n\n3*(195 - 2B) + B + (B -178) + (B -175) = -20.\n\nCompute 3*195 is 585, 3*(-2B) is -6B.\n\nSo:\n\n585 -6B + B + B -178 + B -175 = -20.\n\nCombine terms:\n\n585 -178 -175 = let's calculate that. 585 - (178 +175) = 585 - 353 = 232.\n\nFor B terms: -6B + B + B + B = -3B.\n\nSo equation becomes: 232 -3B = -20 → -3B = -20 -232 → -3B = -252 → B = (-252)/(-3) = 84. So B = 84.\n\nNow that we have B, let's find other variables.\n\nFrom equation (1a): A = 195 - 2B → 195 - 2*84 = 195 - 168 = 27. So A = 27.\n\nFrom equation (6): D = B -175 → 84 -175 = -91. So D = -91.\n\nFrom equation (7): C = B -178 → 84 -178 = -94. So C = -94.\n\nNow we have all variables:\n\nA = 27\n\nB = 84\n\nC = -94\n\nD = -91\n\nLet me check if these values satisfy all equations.\n\nCheck equation 1: 2A +3B + D → 2*27 + 3*84 + (-91) = 54 + 252 -91 = 54 + 252 is 306, minus 91 is 215. Correct. Matches equation 1.\n\nEquation 2: 2A + B + 2C + D → 2*27 +84 + 2*(-94) + (-91) = 54 +84 = 138, 2*(-94) is -188. So 138 -188 = -50, then -50 -91 = -141. Correct. Equation 2 holds.\n\nEquation 3: 3A + B + C + D → 3*27 +84 + (-94) + (-91) = 81 +84 = 165; 165 -94 = 71; 71 -91 = -20. Correct. Equation 3 holds.\n\nEquation 4: 3A + C + 2D → 3*27 + (-94) + 2*(-91) → 81 -94 -182 = 81 -276 = -195. Correct. Equation 4 holds.\n\nEquation 5: A + 2B + 2C + D → 27 + 2*84 + 2*(-94) + (-91). Let's compute:\n\n27 + 168 = 195; 2*(-94) is -188 → 195 -188 = 7; 7 -91 = -84. Correct. Equation 5 holds. All equations are satisfied. Great.\n\nNow that we have the values for each symbol:\n\n^ = A = 27\n\n∅ = B = 84\n\n≈ = C = -94\n\n∑ = D = -91\n\nNow, the next step is to compute the sum of each column. The grid has 6 columns (since each row has 6 symbols). Let me reconstruct the grid with symbols and then replace them with their values.\n\nOriginal grid rows:\n\nRow 1: ^ ∅ ∅ ^ ∑ ∅ → A B B A D B → 27, 84, 84, 27, -91, 84\n\nRow 2: ^ ≈ ^ ∑ ≈ ∅ → A C A D C B → 27, -94, 27, -91, -94, 84\n\nRow 3: ≈ ∑ ^ ∅ ^ ^ → C D A B A A → -94, -91, 27, 84, 27, 27\n\nRow 4: ^ ≈ ∑ ^ ∑ ^ → A C D A D A → 27, -94, -91, 27, -91, 27\n\nRow 5: ^ ∅ ≈ ≈ ∑ ∅ → A B C C D B → 27, 84, -94, -94, -91, 84\n\nNow, arrange these into columns. Let's list each column:\n\nColumn 1: Row1: 27, Row2:27, Row3:-94, Row4:27, Row5:27 → sum?\n\nColumn 2: Row1:84, Row2:-94, Row3:-91, Row4:-94, Row5:84 → sum?\n\nColumn3: Row1:84, Row2:27, Row3:27, Row4:-91, Row5:-94 → sum?\n\nColumn4: Row1:27, Row2:-91, Row3:84, Row4:27, Row5:-94 → sum?\n\nColumn5: Row1:-91, Row2:-94, Row3:27, Row4:-91, Row5:-91 → sum?\n\nColumn6: Row1:84, Row2:84, Row3:27, Row4:27, Row5:84 → sum?\n\nLet me compute each column sum.\n\nColumn 1:\n\n27 (Row1) + 27 (Row2) + (-94) (Row3) +27 (Row4) +27 (Row5) \n\nAdding them: 27 +27 = 54; 54 -94 = -40; -40 +27 = -13; -13 +27 = 14. So Column 1 sum is 14.\n\nColumn 2:\n\n84 (Row1) + (-94) (Row2) + (-91) (Row3) + (-94) (Row4) +84 (Row5)\n\nCalculate step by step:\n\nStart with 84 -94 = -10\n\n-10 -91 = -101\n\n-101 -94 = -195\n\n-195 +84 = -111.

      "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the sum of each column in the given grid based on the row sums provided. Each symbol represents a numerical value, and I need to figure out the column sums. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grid. Let me list out the rows and their symbols along with their total sums. Each row has six symbols followed by the row's total. So there are 8 rows and 6 columns. Let me note down each row's symbols and their sum.\n\nLet me assign each row to a variable for clarity. Let's index the rows from 1 to 8. Each row has symbols in positions 1 to 6. For example, Row 1 is ∝ ∏ ∝ ⇔ ⇔ ∏ with a total of 140. Similarly for the others.\n\nNow, since each column's sum is the sum of all the elements in that column across all rows, I need to find for each column position (from 1 to 6), the sum of the values in that column across all 8 rows.\n\nBut the problem is that each symbol is a variable, and I don't know their individual values. However, since the row sums are given, maybe I can set up equations and solve for the symbols, then compute the column sums. But with multiple symbols, that might be complex. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to compute the column sums without solving for each symbol individually. Let's think: if I sum all the row sums, that should equal the sum of all elements in the grid. Then, the total sum of all columns is the same as the sum of all row sums. However, each column's sum is part of that total. But how does that help me find individual column sums?\n\nWait, if I can find the total sum of all elements, then perhaps if I can find the sum of five columns, the sixth can be derived. But without knowing individual column sums, that might not help directly. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can create a system of equations. Let me denote each symbol as a variable. But there are multiple instances of the same symbol, so their values are consistent. For example, all ∝ symbols have the same value. Similarly for ∏, ⇔, ¬, and ?. Wait, but looking at the symbols used: the symbols are ∝, ∏, ⇔, ¬, and ?. Let me count how many unique symbols there are.\n\nLooking at the grid:\n\nSymbols used are: ∝, ∏, ⇔, ¬, ?, and maybe others? Let me check each row:\n\nRow 1: ∝, ∏, ∝, ⇔, ⇔, ∏ → symbols ∝, ∏, ⇔, ?\n\nRow 2: ¬, ∏, ⇔, ∏, ∝, ⇔ → symbols ¬, ∏, ⇔, ∝, ?\n\nRow 3: ¬, ∝, ⇔, ∏, ∏, ∝ → same as above.\n\nRow 4: ?, ¬, ¬, ∏, ∏, ? → symbols ?, ¬, ∏, ?\n\nRow 5: ¬, ∏, ¬, ∏, ?, ∝ → symbols ¬, ∏, ?, ∝.\n\nRow 6: ∏, ∏, ¬, ∏, ∝, ∏ → symbols ∏, ¬, ∝.\n\nRow 7: ∝, ⇔, ⇔, ?, ¬, ¬ → symbols ∝, ⇔, ?, ¬.\n\nRow 8: ∏, ∝, ¬, ¬, ?, ¬ → symbols ∏, ∝, ¬, ?.\n\nSo the unique symbols are ∝, ∏, ⇔, ¬, and ?. Five symbols. So there are five variables. Let's denote them as:\n\nLet me assign variables:\n\nLet’s say:\n\nA = ∝\n\nB = ∏\n\nC = ⇔\n\nD = ¬\n\nE = ?\n\nNow, each row can be expressed as a combination of these variables. Let me write equations for each row based on their symbols and the given row sum.\n\nRow 1: A + B + A + C + C + B = 140 → 2A + 2B + 2C = 140 → A + B + C = 70. (Equation 1)\n\nRow 2: D + B + C + B + A + C = 119 → D + 2B + A + 2C = 119. (Equation 2)\n\nRow 3: D + A + C + B + B + A = 110 → D + 2A + 2B + C = 110. (Equation 3)\n\nRow 4: E + D + D + B + B + E = 36 → 2E + 2D + 2B = 36 → E + D + B = 18. (Equation 4)\n\nRow 5: D + B + D + B + E + A = 58 → 2D + 2B + E + A = 58. (Equation 5)\n\nRow 6: B + B + D + B + A + B = -119 → 4B + D + A = -119. (Equation 6)\n\nRow 7: A + C + C + E + D + D = 296 → A + 2C + 2D + E = 296. (Equation 7)\n\nRow 8: B + A + D + D + E + D = 147 → B + A + 3D + E = 147. (Equation 8)\n\nNow, we have 8 equations, but some are redundant. Let's list them again:\n\nEquation 1: A + B + C = 70 → (1)\n\nEquation 2: A + 2B + 2C + D = 119 → (2)\n\nEquation 3: 2A + 2B + C + D = 110 → (3)\n\nEquation 4: B + D + E = 18 → (4)\n\nEquation 5: A + 2B + 2D + E = 58 → (5)\n\nEquation 6: A + 4B + D = -119 → (6)\n\nEquation 7: A + 2C + 2D + E = 296 → (7)\n\nEquation 8: A + B + 3D + E = 147 → (8)\n\nNow, we need to solve these equations for A, B, C, D, E. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, from Equation 1: A + B + C = 70. So C = 70 - A - B. Let's keep that in mind.\n\nNow, let's look at Equation 4: B + D + E = 18. So E = 18 - B - D. Let's use this substitution in other equations.\n\nEquation 5: A + 2B + 2D + E = 58. Substitute E:\n\nA + 2B + 2D + (18 - B - D) = 58 → A + 2B + 2D + 18 - B - D = 58 → A + B + D + 18 = 58 → A + B + D = 40. Let's call this Equation 5a: A + B + D = 40.\n\nEquation 6: A + 4B + D = -119. Let's note that.\n\nEquation 8: A + B + 3D + E = 147. Substitute E:\n\nA + B + 3D + (18 - B - D) = 147 → A + B + 3D + 18 - B - D = 147 → A + 2D + 18 = 147 → A + 2D = 129 → Equation 8a: A = 129 - 2D.\n\nNow, Equation 5a is A + B + D = 40. Let's use Equation 8a here. Substitute A:\n\n(129 - 2D) + B + D = 40 → 129 - D + B = 40 → B - D = 40 - 129 → B - D = -89 → B = D - 89. Let's call this Equation 9.\n\nNow, Equation 6: A + 4B + D = -119. Substitute A from 8a and B from 9:\n\n(129 - 2D) + 4*(D - 89) + D = -119.\n\nLet me compute that step by step:\n\n129 - 2D + 4D - 356 + D = -119.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(129 - 356) + (-2D + 4D + D) = -119.\n\n-227 + 3D = -119.\n\n3D = -119 + 227 → 3D = 108 → D = 36.\n\nNow that we have D = 36, let's find B from Equation 9: B = D -89 = 36 -89 = -53.\n\nNow, from Equation 5a: A + B + D = 40. Substitute B and D:\n\nA + (-53) + 36 = 40 → A -17 = 40 → A = 57.\n\nNow, from Equation 8a: A = 129 - 2D → 57 = 129 - 2*36 → 129 -72 = 57. Which checks out.\n\nNow, from Equation 1: A + B + C =70 → 57 + (-53) + C =70 → 4 + C =70 → C=66.\n\nNow, from Equation 4: E = 18 - B - D → E = 18 - (-53) - 36 = 18 +53 -36 = 35.\n\nSo now we have all variables:\n\nA (∝) = 57\n\nB (∏) = -53\n\nC (⇔) = 66\n\nD (¬) = 36\n\nE (?) = 35\n\nLet me verify these values with other equations to make sure there are no mistakes.\n\nCheck Equation 2: A + 2B + 2C + D = ?\n\nA=57, 2B=2*(-53)=-106, 2C=2*66=132, D=36.\n\nTotal: 57 -106 +132 +36 = 57 + ( -106 +132 ) +36 → 57 +26 +36 = 119. Which matches Equation 2's sum of 119. Good.\n\nEquation 3: 2A + 2B + C + D = 2*57 + 2*(-53) +66 +36 = 114 -106 +66 +36 = (114-106)=8 +66=74 +36=110. Which matches Equation 3's sum of 110. Correct.\n\nEquation 7: A + 2C + 2D + E = 57 + 2*66 + 2*36 +35 = 57 +132 +72 +35 = 57+132=189 +72=261 +35=296. Which matches Equation 7. Correct.\n\nEquation 8: A + B + 3D + E = 57 + (-53) + 3*36 +35 = 57-53=4 +108=112 +35=147. Which matches Equation 8. Correct.\n\nEquation 6: A +4B + D = 57 +4*(-53) +36 = 57 -212 +36 = (57+36) -212 = 93 -212 = -119. Correct.\n\nEquation 5: We already used it, but let's check again. Original Equation 5: A + 2B + 2D + E = 57 + 2*(-53) + 2*36 +35 = 57 -106 +72 +35 = (57-106)= -49 +72=23 +35=58. Correct.\n\nSo all equations are satisfied. Great, so the values are correct.\n\nNow, the next step is to compute the column sums. There are 6 columns. For each column (positions 1 to 6), we need to sum the values from each row's corresponding position.\n\nLet me list each column and the symbols in each row for that column.\n\nLet me first write down all the rows and their symbols:\n\nRow 1: [A, B, A, C, C, B]\n\nRow 2: [D, B, C, B, A, C]\n\nRow 3: [D, A, C, B, B, A]\n\nRow 4: [E, D, D, B, B, E]\n\nRow 5: [D, B, D, B, E, A]\n\nRow 6: [B, B, D, B, A, B]\n\nRow 7: [A, C, C, E, D, D]\n\nRow 8: [B, A, D, D, E, D]\n\nNow, for each column from 1 to 6, let's collect the symbols in that column across all rows.\n\nColumn 1 (first element of each row):\n\nRow1: A\n\nRow2: D\n\nRow3: D\n\nRow4: E\n\nRow5: D\n\nRow6: B\n\nRow7: A\n\nRow8: B\n\nSo Column 1 symbols: A, D, D, E, D, B, A, B.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow1: B\n\nRow2: B\n\nRow3: A\n\nRow4: D\n\nRow5: B\n\nRow6: B\n\nRow7: C\n\nRow8: A\n\nColumn 2 symbols: B, B, A, D, B, B, C, A.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow1: A\n\nRow2: C\n\nRow3: C\n\nRow4: D\n\nRow5: D\n\nRow6: D\n\nRow7: C\n\nRow8: D\n\nColumn 3 symbols: A, C, C, D, D, D, C, D.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nRow1: C\n\nRow2: B\n\nRow3: B\n\nRow4: B\n\nRow5: B\n\nRow6: B\n\nRow7: E\n\nRow8: D\n\nColumn 4 symbols: C, B, B, B, B, B, E, D.\n\nColumn 5:\n\nRow1: C\n\nRow2: A\n\nRow3: B\n\nRow4: B\n\nRow5: E\n\nRow6: A\n\nRow7: D\n\nRow8: E\n\nColumn 5 symbols: C, A, B, B, E, A, D, E.\n\nColumn 6:\n\nRow1: B\n\nRow2: C\n\nRow3: A\n\nRow4: E\n\nRow5: A\n\nRow6: B\n\nRow7: D\n\nRow8: D\n\nColumn 6 symbols: B, C, A, E, A, B, D, D.\n\nNow, for each column, substitute the symbols with their numerical values and compute the sum.\n\nLet me compute each column one by one.\n\nFirst, let's recall the values:\n\nA = 57\n\nB = -53\n\nC = 66\n\nD = 36\n\nE = 35\n\nColumn 1:\n\nSymbols: A, D, D, E, D, B, A, B.\n\nValues:\n\nA (57), D (36), D (36), E (35), D (36), B (-53), A (57), B (-53).\n\nSum:\n\n57 + 36 +36 +35 +36 + (-53) +57 + (-53)\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nStart with 57 +36 = 93\n\n+36 = 129\n\n+35 = 164\n\n+36 = 200\n\n-53 = 147\n\n+57 = 204\n\n-53 = 151.\n\nSo Column 1 sum is 151.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nSymbols: B, B, A, D, B, B, C, A.\n\nValues:\n\nB (-53), B (-53), A (57), D (36), B (-53), B (-53), C (66), A (57).\n\nSum:\n\n-53 -53 +57 +36 -53 -53 +66 +57.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nStart with -53 -53 = -106\n\n+57 → -49\n\n+36 → -13\n\n-53 → -66\n\n-53 → -119\n\n+66 → -53\n\n+57 → 4.\n\nSo Column 2 sum is 4.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nSymbols: A, C, C, D, D, D, C, D.\n\nValues:\n\nA (57), C (66), C (66), D (36), D (36), D (36), C (66), D (36).\n\nSum:\n\n57 +66 +66 +36 +36 +36 +66 +36.\n\nLet me compute:\n\n57 +66 = 123\n\n+66 = 189\n\n+36 = 225\n\n+36 = 261\n\n+36 = 297\n\n+66 = 363\n\n+36 = 399.\n\nColumn 3 sum is 399.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nSymbols: C, B, B, B, B, B, E, D.\n\nValues:\n\nC (66), B (-53), B (-53), B (-53), B (-53), B (-53), E (35), D (36).\n\nSum:\n\n66 + (-53)*5 +35 +36.\n\nLet me calculate:\n\nFirst, 5 * (-53) = -265.\n\nSo total is 66 -265 +35 +36.\n\nCompute 66 -265 = -199\n\n+35 = -164\n\n+36 = -128.\n\nSo Column 4 sum is -128.\n\nColumn 5:\n\nSymbols: C, A, B, B, E, A, D, E.\n\nValues:\n\nC (66), A (57), B (-53), B (-53), E (35), A (57), D (36), E (35).\n\nSum:\n\n66 +57 -53 -53 +35 +57 +36 +35.\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nStart with 66 +57 = 123\n\n-53 → 70\n\n-53 → 17\n\n+35 → 52\n\n+57 → 109\n\n+36 → 145\n\n+35 → 180.\n\nColumn 5 sum is 180.\n\nColumn 6:\n\nSymbols: B, C, A, E, A, B, D, D.\n\nValues:\n\nB (-53), C (66), A (57), E (35), A (57), B (-53), D (36), D (36).\n\nSum:\n\n-53 +66 +57 +35 +57 -53 +36 +36.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nStart with -53 +66 = 13\n\n+57 → 70\n\n+35 → 105\n\n+57 → 162\n\n-53 → 109\n\n+36 → 145\n\n+36 → 181.\n\nSo Column 6 sum is 181.\n\nLet me verify the total sum of all columns.

      "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the problem is about a grid with symbols where each symbol represents a numerical value. We're given the sum of each row, and we need to find the sum of each column. The answer should be a list of those column sums.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grid structure. Each line in the input represents a row of symbols followed by the row's sum. Let me parse each row carefully.\n\nLooking at the first row: ♣♣♣//♣♣^ -367. So the symbols are ♣, ♣, ♣, /, /, ♣, ♣, ^. The row sum is -367.\n\nSimilarly, the second row is ^♣///^⊙♣ -162. Symbols: ^, ♣, /, /, /, ^, ⊙, ♣. Sum is -162.\n\nThird row: ♣⊙^⊙♣♣♣^ -630. Symbols: ♣, ⊙, ^, ⊙, ♣, ♣, ♣, ^. Sum -630.\n\nFourth row: //♣⊙♣♣♣^ -343. Symbols: /, /, ♣, ⊙, ♣, ♣, ♣, ^. Sum -343.\n\nFifth row: //^♣♣^⊙♣ -326. Symbols: /, /, ^, ♣, ♣, ^, ⊙, ♣. Sum -326.\n\nEach row has 8 symbols, so the grid is 5 rows by 8 columns. Let me confirm that each row has 8 symbols. Let me count:\n\nFirst row: ♣♣♣//♣♣^ → 3♣, 2/, 2♣, 1^ → total 3+2+2+1? Wait, maybe I should split each row into individual symbols. Let me write each row as a list of symbols:\n\nRow 1: [♣, ♣, ♣, /, /, ♣, ♣, ^]\nRow 2: [^, ♣, /, /, /, ^, ⊙, ♣]\nRow 3: [♣, ⊙, ^, ⊙, ♣, ♣, ♣, ^]\nRow 4: [/ , / , ♣, ⊙, ♣, ♣, ♣, ^]\nRow 5: [/ , / , ^, ♣, ♣, ^, ⊙, ♣]\n\nYes, each row has 8 symbols. So there are 8 columns. Our task is to find the sum for each column (from column 0 to 7?), and output them as a list.\n\nBut how do we find the numerical values for each symbol? Since each symbol has a unique value, and we have 5 equations (row sums) with 3 symbols (♣, /, ^, ⊙). Wait, there are four symbols here: ♣, /, ^, and ⊙. Let me count:\n\nSymbols in the grid: ♣, /, ^, ⊙. So four different symbols. Let me assign variables to them. Let me denote:\n\nLet me define variables:\n\nLet C = value of ♣\n\nS = value of / (maybe slash? but let's use S for simplicity)\n\nH = value of ^ (hat)\n\nO = value of ⊙ (circle?)\n\nNow, each row's symbols can be converted into an equation based on their counts and the given row sum.\n\nFor example, the first row: three ♣, two /, two ♣, one ^. Wait, let me re-express each row's symbols as counts of each symbol:\n\nRow 1: ♣ appears 3 + 2 = 5 times? Wait no, let me list the symbols in order:\n\nRow 1: positions 0-7:\n\n0: ♣, 1: ♣, 2: ♣, 3: /, 4: /, 5: ♣, 6: ♣, 7: ^. So total:\n\n♣: positions 0,1,2,5,6 → 5 times.\n\n/: positions 3,4 → 2 times.\n\n^: position 7 → 1 time.\n\n⊙: 0 times.\n\nSo the equation for row 1 is 5C + 2S + 1H + 0O = -367.\n\nSimilarly, for each row, we can create equations.\n\nLet me do this for all rows.\n\nRow 1: 5C + 2S + H = -367\n\nRow 2: symbols are ^, ♣, /, /, /, ^, ⊙, ♣.\n\nSo:\n\n^: positions 0, 5 → 2 times.\n\n♣: positions 1,7 → 2 times.\n\n/: positions 2,3,4 → 3 times.\n\n⊙: position 6 → 1 time.\n\nSo equation: 2H + 2C + 3S + 1O = -162.\n\nRow 3: ♣, ⊙, ^, ⊙, ♣, ♣, ♣, ^.\n\nSymbols:\n\n♣: positions 0,4,5,6 → 4 times.\n\n⊙: positions 1,3 → 2 times.\n\n^: positions 2,7 → 2 times.\n\n/: 0 times.\n\nEquation: 4C + 2O + 2H = -630.\n\nRow 4: //♣⊙♣♣♣^ → symbols are /, /, ♣, ⊙, ♣, ♣, ♣, ^.\n\nSymbols:\n\n/: positions 0,1 → 2 times.\n\n♣: positions 2,4,5,6 → 4 times.\n\n⊙: position 3 → 1 time.\n\n^: position 7 → 1 time.\n\nEquation: 2S +4C +1O +1H = -343.\n\nRow 5: //^♣♣^⊙♣ → symbols are /, /, ^, ♣, ♣, ^, ⊙, ♣.\n\nSymbols:\n\n/: positions 0,1 → 2 times.\n\n^: positions 2,5 → 2 times.\n\n♣: positions 3,4,7 → 3 times.\n\n⊙: position 6 → 1 time.\n\nEquation: 2S + 2H + 3C + 1O = -326.\n\nSo now, we have 5 equations:\n\n1) 5C + 2S + H = -367\n\n2) 2H + 2C + 3S + O = -162\n\n3) 4C + 2O + 2H = -630\n\n4) 2S +4C + O + H = -343\n\n5) 2S + 3C + 2H + O = -326\n\nWait, let me check equation 2 again. Original symbols for row 2: 2H, 2C, 3S, 1O. So equation is 2H + 2C + 3S + O = -162. Correct.\n\nEquation 4: 2S +4C + O + H = -343. Correct.\n\nEquation 5: 2S (from /), 3C (from ♣), 2H (from ^), 1O (from ⊙). So equation: 2S +3C +2H +O = -326.\n\nSo we have five equations with four variables (C, S, H, O). However, since there are five equations, there might be redundancy or maybe a unique solution. Let's try solving these equations.\n\nLet me write the equations again:\n\nEquation 1: 5C + 2S + H = -367\n\nEquation 2: 2C + 3S + 2H + O = -162\n\nEquation 3: 4C + 2O + 2H = -630\n\nEquation 4: 4C + 2S + O + H = -343\n\nEquation 5: 3C + 2S + 2H + O = -326\n\nHmm. Let's see. Let me try to express variables step by step.\n\nFirst, perhaps we can find expressions for O from equations 2,4,5 and substitute.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract equations to eliminate variables.\n\nLet me note that equations 2,4,5 all have O. Let's see:\n\nEquation 2: 2C + 3S + 2H + O = -162 → O = -162 -2C -3S -2H\n\nEquation 4: 4C + 2S + H + O = -343 → O = -343 -4C -2S -H\n\nEquation 5: 3C + 2S + 2H + O = -326 → O = -326 -3C -2S -2H\n\nSince O is the same in all, we can set equations equal to each other.\n\nSet equation 2's O equal to equation 4's O:\n\n-162 -2C -3S -2H = -343 -4C -2S -H\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\nLeft side: -162 -2C -3S -2H\n\nRight side: -343 -4C -2S -H\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-162 -2C -3S -2H +343 +4C +2S +H = 0\n\nCompute:\n\n( -162 + 343 ) + ( -2C +4C ) + ( -3S +2S ) + ( -2H + H ) = 0\n\n181 + 2C - S - H = 0 → 2C - S - H = -181 → Equation A.\n\nSimilarly, set equation 4's O equal to equation 5's O:\n\nFrom equation 4: O = -343 -4C -2S -H\n\nFrom equation 5: O = -326 -3C -2S -2H\n\nSet equal:\n\n-343 -4C -2S -H = -326 -3C -2S -2H\n\nSimplify:\n\nLeft side: -343 -4C -2S -H\n\nRight side: -326 -3C -2S -2H\n\nSubtract right side from left:\n\n(-343 + 326) + (-4C +3C) + (-2S +2S) + (-H +2H) = 0\n\n-17 -C + 0S + H = 0 → -C + H = 17 → H = C + 17 → Equation B.\n\nSo H is C +17. Let me note that.\n\nNow, let's use equation B in equation A.\n\nEquation A: 2C - S - H = -181. Substitute H = C +17:\n\n2C - S - (C +17) = -181 → 2C - S -C -17 = -181 → C - S -17 = -181 → C - S = -181 +17 = -164 → C - S = -164 → S = C + 164 → Equation C.\n\nSo S is C +164.\n\nNow, let's proceed. Now we have expressions for H and S in terms of C. Let's also find O.\n\nLet me take equation 2's O expression:\n\nO = -162 -2C -3S -2H.\n\nBut substitute S and H in terms of C.\n\nH = C +17, S = C +164.\n\nSo:\n\nO = -162 -2C -3*(C +164) -2*(C +17)\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n-2C \n\n-3*(C +164) = -3C -492\n\n-2*(C +17) = -2C -34\n\nSo adding all:\n\n-162 -2C -3C -492 -2C -34 \n\nCombine like terms:\n\nConstants: -162 -492 -34 = -162-492 is -654, -654-34 is -688.\n\nVariables: -2C -3C -2C = -7C.\n\nThus O = -688 -7C → Equation D.\n\nNow, let's use equation 3, which is 4C + 2O + 2H = -630.\n\nWe can substitute O and H here.\n\nH = C +17, O = -688 -7C.\n\nSo equation 3 becomes:\n\n4C + 2*(-688 -7C) + 2*(C +17) = -630\n\nCompute each term:\n\n4C \n\n+ 2*(-688) = -1376 \n\n+ 2*(-7C) = -14C \n\n+ 2*(C) = 2C \n\n+ 2*(17) = 34 \n\nCombine all:\n\n4C -14C +2C = (4 -14 +2)C = (-8C)\n\nConstants: -1376 +34 = -1342.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n-8C -1342 = -630 → -8C = -630 +1342 → -8C = 712 → C = 712 / (-8) = -89.\n\nSo C = -89. Now we can find other variables.\n\nH = C +17 = -89 +17 = -72.\n\nS = C +164 = -89 +164 = 75.\n\nO = -688 -7C = -688 -7*(-89) = -688 + 623 = -65.\n\nLet me check if these values satisfy equation 3. Let me verify:\n\nEquation 3: 4C + 2O + 2H = ?\n\n4*(-89) = -356\n\n2*(-65) = -130\n\n2*(-72) = -144 \n\nTotal: -356 -130 -144 = -630. Correct. So that's good.\n\nNow, let's check if these values satisfy other equations.\n\nLet me check equation 1: 5C + 2S + H = ?\n\n5*(-89) = -445 \n\n2*75 = 150 \n\nH is -72 \n\nTotal: -445 +150 -72 = (-445 -72) +150 = -517 +150 = -367. Which matches row 1's sum. Good.\n\nCheck equation 2: 2C +3S +2H +O = ?\n\n2*(-89) = -178 \n\n3*75 = 225 \n\n2*(-72) = -144 \n\nO is -65 \n\nTotal: -178 +225 -144 -65 = (225 -178) = 47; 47 -144 = -97; -97 -65 = -162. Correct.\n\nEquation 4: 4C +2S +O +H = ?\n\n4*(-89) = -356 \n\n2*75 = 150 \n\nO is -65 \n\nH is -72 \n\nTotal: -356 +150 -65 -72 = (-356) + (150-65-72) = -356 + (13) = -343. Correct.\n\nEquation 5: 3C +2S +2H +O = ?\n\n3*(-89) = -267 \n\n2*75 = 150 \n\n2*(-72) = -144 \n\nO is -65 \n\nTotal: -267 +150 -144 -65 = (-267 -144 -65) +150 = (-476) +150 = -326. Correct.\n\nAll equations are satisfied. Great! So now we have the values:\n\nC (♣) = -89\n\nS (/) = 75\n\nH (^) = -72\n\nO (⊙) = -65\n\nNow, we need to compute the sum of each column. The grid has 8 columns. Let me reconstruct each column's symbols and compute their sum.\n\nFirst, let's list each row's symbols as per the grid:\n\nRow 1: [♣, ♣, ♣, /, /, ♣, ♣, ^]\n\nRow 2: [^, ♣, /, /, /, ^, ⊙, ♣]\n\nRow 3: [♣, ⊙, ^, ⊙, ♣, ♣, ♣, ^]\n\nRow 4: [/ , / , ♣, ⊙, ♣, ♣, ♣, ^]\n\nRow 5: [/ , / , ^, ♣, ♣, ^, ⊙, ♣]\n\nNow, for each column (0 to 7), collect the symbols from each row and compute their sum.\n\nLet me create a table for each column:\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow 1: ♣ (C=-89)\n\nRow 2: ^ (H=-72)\n\nRow 3: ♣ (C=-89)\n\nRow 4: / (S=75)\n\nRow 5: / (S=75)\n\nSum: -89 + (-72) + (-89) +75 +75 = Let's calculate:\n\n-89 -72 = -161; -161 -89 = -250; +75 is -175; +75 is -100. So column 0 sum is -100.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow1: ♣ (-89)\n\nRow2: ♣ (-89)\n\nRow3: ⊙ (-65)\n\nRow4: / (75)\n\nRow5: / (75)\n\nSum: -89 -89 -65 +75 +75 = \n\n-89-89 = -178; -178-65 = -243; +75 is -168; +75 is -93. Column 1 sum: -93.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow1: ♣ (-89)\n\nRow2: / (75)\n\nRow3: ^ (-72)\n\nRow4: ♣ (-89)\n\nRow5: ^ (-72)\n\nSum: -89 +75 -72 -89 -72 \n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nStart with -89 +75 = -14\n\n-14 -72 = -86 \n\n-86 -89 = -175 \n\n-175 -72 = -247.

Column 6 sum: -397.\n\nColumn 7:\n\nRow1: ^ (-72)\n\nRow2: ♣ (-89)\n\nRow3: ^ (-72)\n\nRow4: ^ (-72)\n\nRow5: ♣ (-89)\n\nSum: -72 -89 -72 -72 -89 \n\nCompute:\n\n-72 -89 = -161 \n\n-161 -72 = -233 \n\n-233 -72 = -305 \n\n-305 -89 = -394. Column 7 sum: -394.\n\nLet me verify if the column sums add up correctly. The total sum of all elements in the grid can be calculated in two ways: sum of row sums or sum of column sums.\n\nSum of row sums is -367 -162 -630 -343 -326 = Let's compute:\n\n-367 -162 = -529 \n\n-529 -630 = -1159 \n\n-1159 -343 = -1502 \n\n-1502 -326 = -1828.\n\nSum of column sums: -100 + (-93) + (-247) + (-69) + (-117) + (-411) + (-397) + (-394).\n\nLet me add them step by step:\n\nStart with -100 -93 = -193 \n\n-193 -247 = -440 \n\n-440 -69 = -509 \n\n-509 -117 = -626 \n\n-626 -411 = -1037 \n\n-1037 -397 = -1434 \n\n-1434 -394 = -1828. \n\nWhich matches. So that's a good check. Therefore, the column sums are correct.\n\nSo the final answer is the list of column sums in order from column 0 to 7:\n\n[-100, -93, -247, -69, -117, -411, -397, -394]\n\nBut let me check if I made any calculation errors in the columns.\n\nLet me recheck some columns:\n\nColumn 0:\n\n-89 (row1) + -72 (row2) + -89 (row3) +75 (row4) +75 (row5) \n\n= (-89 -72 -89) + (75 +75) \n\n= (-250) + 150 = -100.

      "Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, the task is to compute the sum of each column in a grid based on the given row sums and the symbols in each cell. Each symbol represents a numerical value. The example shows that after processing the grid, we need to output the column sums as a list.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grid structure. The input has rows of symbols followed by a number which is the sum of that row. For example, the first row is \"⊥↓↓!∃! -83\" meaning the symbols ⊥, ↓, ↓, !, ∃, ! add up to -83. There are 10 rows provided, each with 6 symbols and their row sum.\n\nThe challenge is to find the column sums. Since there are 6 symbols per row, there should be 6 columns. Therefore, the output will be a list of 6 numbers representing each column's total.\n\nBut how do I find the individual values for each symbol? Because each symbol might appear multiple times in different rows and columns. This seems like a system of equations problem where each row gives an equation based on the symbols in that row. However, since symbols can repeat, we need to find the value each symbol represents.\n\nLet me list out all the symbols present. Looking at the grid:\n\nThe symbols used are: ⊥, ↓, !, ∃, ∈. Wait, let me check each row:\n\nFirst row: ⊥, ↓, ↓, !, ∃, !\nSecond row: ∃, !, ⊥, !, !, ! \nThird row: !, ↓, ∃, ∃, ∈, !\nFourth row: ↓, ⊥, ⊥, ∈, ↓, ↓\nFifth row: ⊥, ↓, ⊥, ⊥, ∃, ↓\nSixth row: ↓, ∈, ∈, ∃, ∃, !\nSeventh row: ⊥, ∈, !, ↓, ∃, ∃\nEighth row: ↓, ↓, !, ⊥, ⊥, ⊥\nNinth row: !, ↓, ↓, ⊥, ⊥, ∃\nTenth row: !, ∈, ↓, ⊥, ↓, ∈\n\nSo the symbols are ⊥, ↓, !, ∃, ∈. Wait, maybe there's another symbol? Let me check again. The third symbol in the third row is ↓, then ∃, ∃, ∈. So ∈ is another symbol. So total of five symbols? Or maybe more? Let me list all symbols:\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\nSymbols are ⊥, ↓, !, ∃, ∈. Let me confirm. The first row has ⊥, ↓, ↓, !, ∃, !. Second row has ∃, !, ⊥, !, !, !. Third row has !, ↓, ∃, ∃, ∈, !. Fourth row has ↓, ⊥, ⊥, ∈, ↓, ↓. Fifth row: ⊥, ↓, ⊥, ⊥, ∃, ↓. Sixth row: ↓, ∈, ∈, ∃, ∃, !. Seventh row: ⊥, ∈, !, ↓, ∃, ∃. Eighth row: ↓, ↓, !, ⊥, ⊥, ⊥. Ninth row: !, ↓, ↓, ⊥, ⊥, ∃. Tenth row: !, ∈, ↓, ⊥, ↓, ∈. So yes, the symbols are ⊥, ↓, !, ∃, and ∈. Five different symbols.\n\nSo each of these symbols has a certain value. Let me denote them as variables:\n\nLet me assign variables:\n\nLet’s say:\n\nLet A = value of ⊥\n\nB = value of ↓\n\nC = value of !\n\nD = value of ∃\n\nE = value of ∈\n\nNow, each row gives an equation based on the symbols in that row. For example, the first row is ⊥, ↓, ↓, !, ∃, ! which translates to A + B + B + C + D + C = -83. Which simplifies to A + 2B + 2C + D = -83.\n\nSimilarly, each row can be converted into an equation. Since there are 10 rows, but only 5 variables, this system of equations might be overdetermined. However, there may be a unique solution if the equations are consistent.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Convert each row into an equation based on the symbols present.\n\n2. Solve the system of equations to find the values of A, B, C, D, E.\n\n3. Once we have the values of each symbol, compute the sum for each column by adding up the values of the symbols in each column.\n\nBut first, step 1: let's create all equations.\n\nLet me list all rows and their equations:\n\nRow 1: ⊥, ↓, ↓, !, ∃, ! → A + 2B + 2C + D = -83 → Equation 1\n\nRow 2: ∃, !, ⊥, !, !, ! → D + C + A + 3C = -263 → A + D + 4C = -263 → Equation 2\n\nRow 3: !, ↓, ∃, ∃, ∈, ! → C + B + 2D + E + C = 174 → B + 2D + E + 2C = 174 → Equation 3\n\nRow 4: ↓, ⊥, ⊥, ∈, ↓, ↓ → B + 2A + E + 2B = -8 → 2A + 3B + E = -8 → Equation 4\n\nRow 5: ⊥, ↓, ⊥, ⊥, ∃, ↓ → A + B + A + A + D + B = -119 → 3A + 2B + D = -119 → Equation 5\n\nRow 6: ↓, ∈, ∈, ∃, ∃, ! → B + 2E + 2D + C = 340 → B + 2E + 2D + C = 340 → Equation 6\n\nRow 7: ⊥, ∈, !, ↓, ∃, ∃ → A + E + C + B + D + D = 156 → A + B + C + 2D + E = 156 → Equation 7\n\nRow 8: ↓, ↓, !, ⊥, ⊥, ⊥ → 2B + C + 3A = -282 → 3A + 2B + C = -282 → Equation 8\n\nRow 9: !, ↓, ↓, ⊥, ⊥, ∃ → C + 2B + 2A + D = -101 → 2A + 2B + C + D = -101 → Equation 9\n\nRow 10: !, ∈, ↓, ⊥, ↓, ∈ → C + E + B + A + B + E = 86 → A + 2B + C + 2E = 86 → Equation 10\n\nNow, we have 10 equations with 5 variables. Let me note them again:\n\nEquation 1: A + 2B + 2C + D = -83\n\nEquation 2: A + D + 4C = -263\n\nEquation 3: B + 2D + E + 2C = 174\n\nEquation 4: 2A + 3B + E = -8\n\nEquation 5: 3A + 2B + D = -119\n\nEquation 6: B + C + 2D + 2E = 340? Wait, no. Wait equation 6: B + 2E + 2D + C = 340. So rearranged as B + C + 2D + 2E = 340.\n\nEquation 7: A + B + C + 2D + E = 156\n\nEquation 8: 3A + 2B + C = -282\n\nEquation 9: 2A + 2B + C + D = -101\n\nEquation 10: A + 2B + C + 2E = 86\n\nThis seems a lot. Let me see if I can find some equations that can be used to solve for variables step by step.\n\nFirst, perhaps we can use equations 1, 2, 5, 8, and 9 which involve A, B, C, D.\n\nLet me start with equations 1 and 2. Let me see if I can express some variables.\n\nEquation 1: A + 2B + 2C + D = -83\n\nEquation 2: A + D + 4C = -263\n\nIf I subtract equation 2 from equation 1, perhaps? Let me see:\n\nEquation 1 minus Equation 2:\n\n(A + 2B + 2C + D) - (A + D + 4C) = (-83) - (-263)\n\nSimplify left side: A - A + 2B + 2C - 4C + D - D = 2B - 2C\n\nRight side: -83 + 263 = 180\n\nSo 2B - 2C = 180 → divide by 2: B - C = 90 → B = C + 90. Let's note that as Equation 11.\n\nNow, let's look at Equation 5: 3A + 2B + D = -119.\n\nEquation 2 is A + D + 4C = -263. Let me see if I can express D from equation 2.\n\nFrom Equation 2: D = -263 - A - 4C.\n\nLet me substitute D into Equation 5:\n\n3A + 2B + (-263 - A -4C) = -119 → 3A -A + 2B -4C -263 = -119 → 2A + 2B -4C = -119 + 263 → 2A + 2B -4C = 144 → Divide by 2: A + B - 2C = 72. Let's call this Equation 12.\n\nBut from Equation 11, B = C + 90. Substitute B into Equation 12:\n\nA + (C + 90) - 2C = 72 → A - C + 90 = 72 → A - C = -18 → A = C - 18. Equation 13.\n\nNow, let's look at Equation 8: 3A + 2B + C = -282. Substitute B and A from Equations 11 and 13.\n\nA = C - 18, B = C + 90. So:\n\n3*(C -18) + 2*(C +90) + C = -282 → 3C -54 + 2C + 180 + C = -282 → (3C + 2C + C) + (-54 + 180) = -282 → 6C + 126 = -282 → 6C = -282 -126 = -408 → C = -408 / 6 = -68.\n\nSo C = -68. Then from Equation 11, B = -68 + 90 = 22.\n\nFrom Equation 13, A = -68 -18 = -86.\n\nNow we have A, B, C. Let's find D from Equation 2:\n\nEquation 2: A + D + 4C = -263 → D = -263 -A -4C.\n\nSubstituting A = -86, C = -68:\n\nD = -263 - (-86) -4*(-68) = -263 + 86 + 272 = (-263 + 86) is -177, plus 272 is 95. So D = 95.\n\nNow we have A, B, C, D. Let's check if these values satisfy other equations to see if there's consistency.\n\nLet's check Equation 1: A + 2B + 2C + D = ?\n\nA = -86, 2B = 2*22=44, 2C=2*(-68)=-136, D=95. Sum: -86 +44 -136 +95 = (-86 +44) is -42; -42 -136 is -178; -178 +95 = -83. Which matches Equation 1's -83. Good.\n\nEquation 5: 3A + 2B + D = 3*(-86) + 2*22 +95 = -258 +44 +95 = (-258 + 139) = -119. Correct.\n\nEquation 8: 3A + 2B + C = 3*(-86) + 2*22 + (-68) = -258 +44 -68 = -258 + (-24) = -282. Correct.\n\nNow, moving on to find E. Let's look at Equation 4: 2A + 3B + E = -8.\n\nWe have A=-86, B=22. Let's compute:\n\n2*(-86) + 3*22 + E = -172 + 66 + E = -106 + E = -8 → E = -8 + 106 = 98. So E = 98.\n\nLet me check this with another equation. Let's take Equation 7: A + B + C + 2D + E = 156.\n\nA=-86, B=22, C=-68, D=95, E=98.\n\nSum: -86 +22 -68 + 2*95 +98.\n\nCalculate step by step:\n\n-86 +22 = -64; -64 -68 = -132; 2*95=190; -132 +190 = 58; 58 +98=156. Correct.\n\nNow check Equation 3: B + 2D + E + 2C = 174.\n\nB=22, 2D=2*95=190, E=98, 2C=2*(-68)=-136. Sum: 22+190+98-136 = (22+190)=212; 212+98=310; 310-136=174. Correct.\n\nEquation 6: B + C + 2D + 2E = 340? Wait, Equation 6 is B + C + 2D + 2E? Let me check:\n\nOriginal Equation 6: B + C + 2D + 2E? Let me recheck the equation.\n\nOriginal equation 6: B + C + 2D + 2E? Wait, the original equation was:\n\nEquation 6: B + C + 2D + 2E = 340?\n\nWait, the original equation 6 comes from row 6: ↓, ∈, ∈, ∃, ∃, ! → B + 2E + 2D + C = 340. Which is B + C + 2D + 2E = 340. Let's compute with our values:\n\nB=22, C=-68, 2D=190, 2E=196. Sum: 22 -68 +190 +196 = (22-68) = -46; -46 +190=144; 144+196=340. Correct.\n\nEquation 10: A + 2B + C + 2E = 86. Let's check:\n\nA=-86, 2B=44, C=-68, 2E=196. Sum: -86 +44 -68 +196 = (-86 +44) = -42; -42 -68 = -110; -110 +196 = 86. Correct.\n\nNow, let's check Equation 9: 2A + 2B + C + D = -101. \n\n2*(-86) + 2*22 + (-68) + 95 = -172 +44 -68 +95. Let's compute:\n\n-172 +44 = -128; -128 -68 = -196; -196 +95 = -101. Correct.\n\nEquation 7 was already checked. What about Equation 4? Equation 4: 2A + 3B + E = -8. Which we used to find E. And we checked with Equation 7.\n\nSo all equations seem to be satisfied with these values. Great! So the values are:\n\nA (⊥) = -86\n\nB (↓) = 22\n\nC (!) = -68\n\nD (∃) = 95\n\nE (∈) = 98\n\nNow that we have all the symbol values, the next step is to compute the column sums. Each column has 10 entries (since there are 10 rows), and each entry is a symbol whose value we know. So we need to go through each column (columns 1 to 6) and sum the values of the symbols in that column.\n\nLet me reconstruct the grid with symbols, then for each column, list the symbols and compute their sum.\n\nThe grid rows (without the sums) are:\n\nRow 1: ⊥ ↓ ↓ ! ∃ !\nRow 2: ∃ ! ⊥ ! ! !\nRow 3: ! ↓ ∃ ∃ ∈ !\nRow 4: ↓ ⊥ ⊥ ∈ ↓ ↓\nRow 5: ⊥ ↓ ⊥ ⊥ ∃ ↓\nRow 6: ↓ ∈ ∈ ∃ ∃ !\nRow 7: ⊥ ∈ ! ↓ ∃ ∃\nRow 8: ↓ ↓ ! ⊥ ⊥ ⊥\nRow 9: ! ↓ ↓ ⊥ ⊥ ∃\nRow 10: ! ∈ ↓ ⊥ ↓ ∈\n\nLet me list each column:\n\nColumn 1: symbols from each row's first position:\n\nRow1: ⊥\nRow2: ∃\nRow3: !\nRow4: ↓\nRow5: ⊥\nRow6: ↓\nRow7: ⊥\nRow8: ↓\nRow9: !\nRow10: !\n\nSo column 1 symbols: ⊥, ∃, !, ↓, ⊥, ↓, ⊥, ↓, !, !\n\nNow, let's compute each symbol's value and sum them.\n\n⊥ is -86, ∃ is 95, ! is -68, ↓ is 22.\n\nLet's list each entry:\n\nRow1: -86\n\nRow2: 95\n\nRow3: -68\n\nRow4: 22\n\nRow5: -86\n\nRow6: 22\n\nRow7: -86\n\nRow8: 22\n\nRow9: -68\n\nRow10: -68\n\nNow sum these numbers:\n\nLet me add them step by step.\n\nStart with 0.\n\nAdd -86 → -86\n\nAdd 95 → 9\n\nAdd -68 → -59\n\nAdd 22 → -37\n\nAdd -86 → -123\n\nAdd 22 → -101\n\nAdd -86 → -187\n\nAdd 22 → -165\n\nAdd -68 → -233\n\nAdd -68 → -301.\n\nSo column 1 sum is -301.\n\nNow column 2:\n\nSymbols from each row's second position:\n\nRow1: ↓\n\nRow2: ! \n\nRow3: ↓ \n\nRow4: ⊥ \n\nRow5: ↓ \n\nRow6: ∈ \n\nRow7: ∈ \n\nRow8: ↓ \n\nRow9: ↓ \n\nRow10: ↓ \n\nSo symbols: ↓, !, ↓, ⊥, ↓, ∈, ∈, ↓, ↓, ↓\n\nValues:\n\n↓ is 22, ! is -68, ⊥ is -86, ∈ is 98.\n\nLet's list each value:\n\nRow1: 22\n\nRow2: -68\n\nRow3: 22\n\nRow4: -86\n\nRow5: 22\n\nRow6: 98\n\nRow7: 98\n\nRow8: 22\n\nRow9: 22\n\nRow10: 22\n\nNow sum these:\n\nStart adding:\n\n22 -68 = -46\n\n-46 +22 = -24\n\n-24 -86 = -110\n\n-110 +22 = -88\n\n-88 +98 = 10\n\n10 +98 = 108\n\n108 +22 = 130\n\n130 +22 = 152\n\n152 +22 = 174.\n\nSo column 2 sum is 174.\n\nColumn 3: third position symbols:\n\nRow1: ↓ \n\nRow2: ⊥ \n\nRow3: ∃ \n\nRow4: ⊥ \n\nRow5: ⊥ \n\nRow6: ∈ \n\nRow7: ! \n\nRow8: ! \n\nRow9: ↓ \n\nRow10: ⊥ \n\nSymbols: ↓, ⊥, ∃, ⊥, ⊥, ∈, !, !, ↓, ⊥.\n\nValues:\n\n↓ is 22, ⊥ is -86, ∃ is 95, ∈ is 98, ! is -68.\n\nList each value:\n\nRow1: 22\n\nRow2: -86\n\nRow3: 95\n\nRow4: -86\n\nRow5: -86\n\nRow6: 98\n\nRow7: -68\n\nRow8: -68\n\nRow9: 22\n\nRow10: -86\n\nSum:\n\nStart with 22 -86 = -64\n\n-64 +95 = 31\n\n31 -86 = -55\n\n-55 -86 = -141\n\n-141 +98 = -43\n\n-43 -68 = -111\n\n-111 -68 = -179\n\n-179 +22 = -157\n\n-157 -86 = -243.\n\nSo column 3 sum is -243.\n\nColumn 4: fourth position symbols:\n\nRow1: ! \n\nRow2: ! \n\nRow3: ∃ \n\nRow4: ∈ \n\nRow5: ⊥ \n\nRow6: ∃ \n\nRow7: ↓ \n\nRow8: ⊥ \n\nRow9: ⊥ \n\nRow10: ⊥ \n\nSymbols: !, !, ∃, ∈, ⊥, ∃, ↓, ⊥, ⊥, ⊥.\n\nValues:\n\n! is -68, ∃ is 95, ∈ is 98, ⊥ is -86, ↓ is 22.\n\nList each:\n\nRow1: -68\n\nRow2: -68\n\nRow3: 95\n\nRow4: 98\n\nRow5: -86\n\nRow6: 95\n\nRow7: 22\n\nRow8: -86\n\nRow9: -86\n\nRow10: -86\n\nSum:\n\nStart with -68 -68 = -136\n\n-136 +95 = -41\n\n-41 +98 = 57\n\n57 -86 = -29\n\n-29 +95 = 66\n\n66 +22 = 88\n\n88 -86 = 2\n\n2 -86 = -84\n\n-84 -86 = -170.\n\nWait let me recount step by step:\n\nRow1: -68\n\nRow2: -68 → total -136\n\nRow3: +95 → -136 +95 = -41\n\nRow4: +98 → -41 +98 = 57\n\nRow5: -86 → 57 -86 = -29\n\nRow6: +95 → -29 +95 = 66\n\nRow7: +22 → 66 +22 = 88\n\nRow8: -86 → 88 -86 = 2\n\nRow9: -86 → 2 -86 = -84\n\nRow10: -86 → -84 -86 = -170.\n\nSo column 4 sum is -170.\n\nColumn 5: fifth position symbols:\n\nRow1: ∃ \n\nRow2: ! \n\nRow3: ∈ \n\nRow4: ↓ \n\nRow5: ∃ \n\nRow6: ∃ \n\nRow7: ∃ \n\nRow8: ⊥ \n\nRow9: ⊥ \n\nRow10: ↓ \n\nSymbols: ∃, !, ∈, ↓, ∃, ∃, ∃, ⊥, ⊥, ↓.\n\nValues:\n\n∃ is 95, ! is -68, ∈ is 98, ↓ is 22, ⊥ is -86.\n\nList each:\n\nRow1: 95\n\nRow2: -68\n\nRow3: 98\n\nRow4: 22\n\nRow5: 95\n\nRow6: 95\n\nRow7: 95\n\nRow8: -86\n\nRow9: -86\n\nRow10: 22\n\nSum:\n\nStart with 95 -68 = 27\n\n27 +98 = 125\n\n125 +22 = 147\n\n147 +95 = 242\n\n242 +95 = 337\n\n337 +95 = 432\n\n432 -86 = 346\n\n346 -86 = 260\n\n260 +22 = 282.\n\nSo column 5 sum is 282.\n\nColumn 6: sixth position symbols:\n\nRow1: ! \n\nRow2: ! \n\nRow3: ! \n\nRow4: ↓ \n\nRow5: ↓ \n\nRow6: ! \n\nRow7: ∃ \n\nRow8: ⊥ \n\nRow9: ∃ \n\nRow10: ∈ \n\nSymbols: !, !, !, ↓, ↓, !, ∃, ⊥, ∃, ∈.\n\nValues:\n\n! is -68, ↓ is 22, ∃ is 95, ⊥ is -86, ∈ is 98.\n\nList each:\n\nRow1: -68\n\nRow2: -68\n\nRow3: -68\n\nRow4: 22\n\nRow5: 22\n\nRow6: -68\n\nRow7: 95\n\nRow8: -86\n\nRow9: 95\n\nRow10: 98\n\nSum:\n\nStart with -68 -68 = -136\n\n-136 -68 = -204\n\n-204 +22 = -182\n\n-182 +22 = -160\n\n-160 -68 = -228\n\n-228 +95 = -133\n\n-133 -86 = -219\n\n-219 +95 = -124\n\n-124 +98 = -26.\n\nSo column 6 sum is -26.\n\nPutting it all together, the column sums are:\n\nColumn 1: -301\n\nColumn 2: 174\n\nColumn 3: -243\n\nColumn 4: -170\n\nColumn 5: 282\n\nColumn 6: -26\n\nSo the answer should be the list of these six numbers in order: [-301, 174, -243, -170, 282, -26]\n\nLet me double-check the column sums to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nFor column 1 sum: -301.

      "Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, the task is to compute the sum of each column in a grid where each symbol represents a numerical value. We're given the sum of each row, which might help us determine the individual symbol values. Then, once we know the symbols' values, we can calculate the column sums and output them as a list.\n\nFirst, let's look at the grid provided. Each row has symbols and a sum. The symbols are things like ⊗, @, ∂, ?, ⊕, ♥, etc. Each of these symbols corresponds to a number. Since the grid is rectangular, each row has the same number of columns. Let me count the symbols in each row to confirm.\n\nLooking at the first row: ⊗@∂??⊗∂ has 7 symbols. Let me check the others. The second row is @⊗∂∂??⊕, also 7. Third is ⊗⊕∂♥@⊗⊕ (7), fourth ??♥?@@♥ (7), fifth ⊗@⊗@⊗⊕♥ (7), sixth ⊗♥@@⊕∂⊗ (7), seventh ⊕⊕∂♥?♥∂ (7), eighth ⊗?@@♥?♥ (7), ninth ∂⊗⊕♥♥♥? (7). So all rows have 7 symbols. Therefore, there are 7 columns. Our goal is to find the sum of each column.\n\nBut how do we find the value of each symbol? Since each row's sum is given, maybe we can set up equations based on the symbols in each row. Let's denote each symbol with a variable. For example, let me assign variables:\n\nLet’s say:\nA = ⊗\nB = @\nC = ∂\nD = ?\nE = ⊕\nF = ♥\n\nNow, each row's symbols can be converted into expressions using these variables. For example, the first row is A B C D D A C, and the sum is -356. So, the equation would be A + B + C + D + D + A + C = -356. Which simplifies to 2A + B + 2C + 2D = -356.\n\nSimilarly, we can do this for each row. Then, we have a system of equations that we can solve to find the values of A, B, C, D, E, F. Once we have these values, we can compute the column sums.\n\nBut there are 9 rows and 6 symbols. Let me check how many equations we can get. Each row gives one equation. However, some equations may be redundant, but with 9 equations and 6 variables, it's possible to solve if the system is consistent.\n\nLet me list all equations:\n\nRow 1: A B C D D A C → 2A + B + 2C + 2D = -356 → Equation 1.\n\nRow 2: @⊗∂∂??⊕ → B A C C D D E → B + A + 2C + 2D + E = -231 → Equation 2.\n\nRow 3: ⊗⊕∂♥@⊗⊕ → A E C F B A E → A + E + C + F + B + A + E → 2A + B + C + 2E + F = -143 → Equation 3.\n\nRow 4: ??♥?@@♥ → D D F D B B F → 2D + F + D + 2B + F → 2B + 3D + 2F = -76 → Equation 4.\n\nRow 5: ⊗@⊗@⊗⊕♥ → A B A B A E F → 3A + 2B + E + F = -176 → Equation 5.\n\nRow 6: ⊗♥@@⊕∂⊗ → A F B B E C A → A + F + 2B + E + C + A → 2A + 2B + C + E + F = -184 → Equation 6.\n\nRow 7: ⊕⊕∂♥?♥∂ → E E C F D F C → 2E + C + 2F + D + C → 2E + 2C + D + 2F = -118 → Equation 7.\n\nRow 8: ⊗?@@♥?♥ → A D B B F D F → A + D + 2B + F + D + F → A + 2B + 2D + 2F = -130 → Equation 8.\n\nRow 9: ∂⊗⊕♥♥♥? → C A E F F F D → C + A + E + 3F + D = -172 → Equation 9.\n\nNow, we have 9 equations with 6 variables. Let me write all equations more clearly:\n\nEquation 1: 2A + B + 2C + 2D = -356\n\nEquation 2: A + B + 2C + 2D + E = -231\n\nEquation 3: 2A + B + C + 2E + F = -143\n\nEquation 4: 2B + 3D + 2F = -76\n\nEquation 5: 3A + 2B + E + F = -176\n\nEquation 6: 2A + 2B + C + E + F = -184\n\nEquation 7: 2E + 2C + D + 2F = -118\n\nEquation 8: A + 2B + 2D + 2F = -130\n\nEquation 9: A + C + E + 3F + D = -172\n\nNow, solving this system of equations. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, let's note that there are multiple variables. Let's see if we can express variables in terms of others or find substitutions.\n\nLet me start with Equation 1 and Equation 2. Equation 1 is 2A + B + 2C + 2D = -356. Equation 2 is A + B + 2C + 2D + E = -231. If we subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2, we can eliminate some terms.\n\nEquation 2 minus Equation 1:\n\n(A + B + 2C + 2D + E) - (2A + B + 2C + 2D) = -231 - (-356)\n\nSimplify left side:\n\nA - 2A + B - B + 2C - 2C + 2D - 2D + E = -A + E\n\nRight side: -231 + 356 = 125\n\nSo, -A + E = 125 → E = A + 125. Let's call this Equation 10.\n\nNow, Equation 10: E = A + 125.\n\nLet's see if we can use this in other equations. Let's look at Equation 3 and Equation 5, which involve E and F.\n\nEquation 3: 2A + B + C + 2E + F = -143. Substitute E from Equation 10:\n\n2A + B + C + 2(A + 125) + F = -143 → 2A + B + C + 2A + 250 + F = -143 → 4A + B + C + F = -143 -250 = -393 → Equation 3a: 4A + B + C + F = -393.\n\nEquation 5: 3A + 2B + E + F = -176. Substitute E:\n\n3A + 2B + (A + 125) + F = -176 → 4A + 2B + F = -176 -125 = -2A -2B -F? Wait:\n\nWait, 3A + A is 4A. 2B remains. Then +125 + F. So total is 4A + 2B + F + 125 = -176 → 4A + 2B + F = -176 -125 = -2A -2B -F? Wait, no:\n\nWait 3A + 2B + (A + 125) + F = 4A + 2B + F + 125 = -176 → 4A + 2B + F = -176 - 125 = -2A? No, 4A + 2B + F = -176 -125 = -2A? Wait, no. Let me recalculate:\n\nOriginal equation after substitution:\n\n4A + 2B + F + 125 = -176 → subtract 125 from both sides:\n\n4A + 2B + F = -176 -125 = -301 → Equation 5a: 4A + 2B + F = -301.\n\nNow, we have Equation 3a (4A + B + C + F = -393) and Equation 5a (4A + 2B + F = -301). Let's subtract Equation 3a from Equation 5a:\n\n(4A + 2B + F) - (4A + B + C + F) = -301 - (-393)\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n(0A) + (2B - B) + (F - F) - C = B - C\n\nRight side: -301 + 393 = 92\n\nSo, B - C = 92 → B = C + 92 → Equation 11.\n\nSo, Equation 11: B = C + 92.\n\nNow, let's go back to Equation 1: 2A + B + 2C + 2D = -356. Since B = C + 92, substitute into Equation 1:\n\n2A + (C + 92) + 2C + 2D = -356 → 2A + C + 92 + 2C + 2D = -356 → 2A + 3C + 2D = -356 -92 = -448 → Equation 1b: 2A + 3C + 2D = -448.\n\nNow, let's look at Equation 8: A + 2B + 2D + 2F = -130. Again, substitute B = C + 92:\n\nA + 2(C + 92) + 2D + 2F = -130 → A + 2C + 184 + 2D + 2F = -130 → A + 2C + 2D + 2F = -130 -184 = -314 → Equation 8a: A + 2C + 2D + 2F = -314.\n\nNow, let's look at Equation 4: 2B + 3D + 2F = -76. Substitute B = C + 92:\n\n2(C + 92) + 3D + 2F = -76 → 2C + 184 + 3D + 2F = -76 → 2C + 3D + 2F = -76 -184 = -260 → Equation 4a: 2C + 3D + 2F = -260.\n\nNow, let's see if we can find relations between these equations.\n\nWe have Equation 1b: 2A + 3C + 2D = -448.\n\nEquation 8a: A + 2C + 2D + 2F = -314.\n\nEquation 4a: 2C + 3D + 2F = -260.\n\nLet me try to express variables. Let's see if we can find another equation involving A and F.\n\nLooking at Equation 3a: 4A + B + C + F = -393. Since B = C + 92, substitute:\n\n4A + (C + 92) + C + F = -393 → 4A + 2C + 92 + F = -393 → 4A + 2C + F = -393 -92 = -485 → Equation 3b: 4A + 2C + F = -485.\n\nNow, Equation 5a: 4A + 2B + F = -301. Since B = C + 92, substitute:\n\n4A + 2(C + 92) + F = -301 → 4A + 2C + 184 + F = -301 → 4A + 2C + F = -301 -184 = -485. Wait, that's the same as Equation 3b. So Equations 3a and 5a after substitution give the same equation. So no new info here. So, that suggests that Equations 3 and 5 are dependent once we have Equations 10 and 11. So, moving on.\n\nNow, let's see if we can find another equation involving F. Let's look at Equation 7: 2E + 2C + D + 2F = -118. Since E = A + 125 (Equation 10), substitute:\n\n2(A + 125) + 2C + D + 2F = -118 → 2A + 250 + 2C + D + 2F = -118 → 2A + 2C + D + 2F = -118 -250 = -368 → Equation 7a: 2A + 2C + D + 2F = -368.\n\nEquation 8a is A + 2C + 2D + 2F = -314.\n\nEquation 4a is 2C + 3D + 2F = -260.\n\nLet me see if we can combine these equations. Let's consider Equations 7a and 8a.\n\nEquation 7a: 2A + 2C + D + 2F = -368.\n\nEquation 8a: A + 2C + 2D + 2F = -314.\n\nLet me subtract Equation 8a from Equation 7a multiplied by something. Alternatively, let's try to eliminate variables.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nEquation 7a: 2A + 2C + D + 2F = -368.\n\nEquation 8a: A + 2C + 2D + 2F = -314.\n\nIf I multiply Equation 8a by 2, I get 2A + 4C + 4D + 4F = -628. Then subtract Equation 7a multiplied by 1:\n\n(2A + 4C + 4D + 4F) - (2A + 2C + D + 2F) = -628 - (-368)\n\nLeft side: 0A + 2C + 3D + 2F = -628 + 368 = -260.\n\nWait, the left side is 2C + 3D + 2F. Which is exactly Equation 4a: 2C + 3D + 2F = -260. So this shows that Equations 7a, 8a, and 4a are connected. So, no new info here. So we need to find another way.\n\nLet me look at Equation 9: A + C + E + 3F + D = -172. Substitute E = A + 125:\n\nA + C + (A + 125) + 3F + D = -172 → 2A + C + D + 3F + 125 = -172 → 2A + C + D + 3F = -172 -125 = -297 → Equation 9a: 2A + C + D + 3F = -297.\n\nNow, let's see if we can find relations between Equations 1b, 7a, 8a, 9a, etc.\n\nWe have Equation 1b: 2A + 3C + 2D = -448.\n\nEquation 7a: 2A + 2C + D + 2F = -368.\n\nEquation 8a: A + 2C + 2D + 2F = -314.\n\nEquation 9a: 2A + C + D + 3F = -297.\n\nLet me try to express variables. Let's see if we can find expressions for A, C, D, F.\n\nLet me consider Equations 8a and 7a. Let's subtract Equation 8a from Equation 7a:\n\nEquation 7a: 2A + 2C + D + 2F = -368\n\nMinus Equation 8a: A + 2C + 2D + 2F = -314\n\nResult:\n\n(2A - A) + (2C - 2C) + (D - 2D) + (2F - 2F) = -368 - (-314)\n\nWhich is A - D = -368 + 314 = -54 → A - D = -54 → A = D -54 → Equation 12.\n\nSo Equation 12: A = D -54.\n\nNow, substitute A = D -54 into Equation 1b: 2A + 3C + 2D = -448.\n\nSubstitute A:\n\n2*(D -54) + 3C + 2D = -448 → 2D -108 + 3C + 2D = -448 → 4D + 3C -108 = -448 → 4D + 3C = -448 + 108 = -340 → Equation 13: 4D + 3C = -340.\n\nNow, let's use Equation 12 (A = D -54) in Equation 8a: A + 2C + 2D + 2F = -314.\n\nSubstitute A:\n\n(D -54) + 2C + 2D + 2F = -314 → 3D + 2C -54 + 2F = -314 → 3D + 2C + 2F = -314 +54 = -260 → Equation 14: 3D + 2C + 2F = -260.\n\nNow, Equation 4a was 2C + 3D + 2F = -260. Which is the same as Equation 14. So again, no new info. So we need another equation.\n\nLet's look at Equation 9a: 2A + C + D + 3F = -297. Substitute A = D -54:\n\n2*(D -54) + C + D + 3F = -297 → 2D -108 + C + D + 3F = -297 → 3D + C -108 + 3F = -297 → 3D + C + 3F = -297 +108 = -189 → Equation 15: 3D + C + 3F = -189.\n\nNow, let's see if we can find another equation involving D, C, F. Let's look at Equation 7a: 2A + 2C + D + 2F = -368. Substitute A = D -54:\n\n2*(D -54) + 2C + D + 2F = -368 → 2D -108 + 2C + D + 2F = -368 → 3D + 2C + 2F = -368 + 108 = -260 → Which is Equation 14 again. So no new info.\n\nLet me check Equation 3b: 4A + 2C + F = -485. Substitute A = D -54:\n\n4*(D -54) + 2C + F = -485 → 4D -216 + 2C + F = -485 → 4D + 2C + F = -485 + 216 = -269 → Equation 16: 4D + 2C + F = -269.\n\nNow, we have Equation 13: 4D + 3C = -340.\n\nEquation 15: 3D + C + 3F = -189.\n\nEquation 16: 4D + 2C + F = -269.\n\nLet me see if I can express variables here. Let's try to find expressions for C and F in terms of D.\n\nFrom Equation 13: 4D + 3C = -340 → 3C = -340 -4D → C = (-340 -4D)/3 → Equation 17.\n\nNow, substitute Equation 17 into Equation 16:\n\n4D + 2*[(-340 -4D)/3] + F = -269 → Let's compute this.\n\nFirst, 4D + (2*(-340 -4D))/3 + F = -269.\n\nMultiply all terms by 3 to eliminate denominators:\n\n3*4D + 2*(-340 -4D) + 3F = 3*(-269)\n\nWhich is 12D -680 -8D + 3F = -807 → 4D -680 + 3F = -807 → 4D + 3F = -807 + 680 = -127 → Equation 18: 4D + 3F = -127.\n\nNow, Equation 15: 3D + C + 3F = -189. Substitute C from Equation 17:\n\n3D + [(-340 -4D)/3] + 3F = -189.\n\nMultiply all terms by 3 to eliminate denominators:\n\n9D + (-340 -4D) + 9F = -567 → 5D -340 +9F = -567 → 5D +9F = -567 +340 = -227 → Equation 19: 5D +9F = -227.\n\nNow, we have Equation 18: 4D + 3F = -127 and Equation 19: 5D +9F = -227. Let's solve these two equations for D and F.\n\nLet me multiply Equation 18 by 3 to get:\n\n12D +9F = -381 → Equation 18a.\n\nEquation 19 is 5D +9F = -227.\n\nSubtract Equation 19 from Equation 18a:\n\n(12D +9F) - (5D +9F) = -381 - (-227) → 7D = -154 → D = -154 /7 = -22. So D = -22.\n\nNow, substitute D = -22 into Equation 18: 4*(-22) + 3F = -127 → -88 +3F = -127 → 3F = -127 +88 = -39 → F = -13.\n\nSo F = -13.\n\nNow, with D = -22, we can find C from Equation 17: C = (-340 -4D)/3 = (-340 -4*(-22))/3 = (-340 +88)/3 = (-252)/3 = -84. So C = -84.\n\nNow, B = C +92 (from Equation 11) → B = -84 +92 = 8.\n\nA = D -54 (Equation 12) → A = -22 -54 = -76.\n\nE = A + 125 (Equation 10) → E = -76 +125 = 49.\n\nSo now we have all variables:\n\nA = ⊗ = -76\n\nB = @ = 8\n\nC = ∂ = -84\n\nD = ? = -22\n\nE = ⊕ = 49\n\nF = ♥ = -13\n\nLet me verify these values with some equations to check for consistency.\n\nLet's check Equation 1: 2A + B + 2C + 2D = 2*(-76) +8 + 2*(-84) + 2*(-22) = -152 +8 -168 -44 = (-152 +8) is -144; -144 -168 is -312; -312 -44 = -356. Which matches the first row's sum. Good.\n\nEquation 2: A + B + 2C + 2D + E → -76 +8 + 2*(-84) + 2*(-22) +49 = (-76 +8) = -68; -68 -168 = -236; -236 -44 = -280; -280 +49 = -231. Which matches the second row's sum. Good.\n\nEquation 3: 2A + B + C + 2E + F → 2*(-76) +8 + (-84) + 2*49 + (-13) → -152 +8 -84 +98 -13. Let's compute step by step:\n\n-152 +8 = -144; -144 -84 = -228; -228 +98 = -130; -130 -13 = -143. Correct.\n\nEquation 4: 2B +3D +2F → 2*8 +3*(-22) +2*(-13) → 16 -66 -26 = 16 -92 = -76. Correct.\n\nEquation 5: 3A +2B +E +F → 3*(-76) +2*8 +49 + (-13) → -228 +16 +49 -13 = (-228 +16) = -212; -212 +49 = -163; -163 -13 = -176. Correct.\n\nEquation 6: 2A + 2B + C + E + F → 2*(-76) +2*8 + (-84) +49 + (-13) → -152 +16 -84 +49 -13. Let's compute:\n\n-152 +16 = -136; -136 -84 = -220; -220 +49 = -171; -171 -13 = -184. Correct.\n\nEquation 7: 2E +2C +D +2F → 2*49 +2*(-84) + (-22) +2*(-13) → 98 -168 -22 -26 = 98 - (168+22+26) = 98 - 216 = -118. Correct.\n\nEquation 8: A +2B +2D +2F → -76 +2*8 +2*(-22) +2*(-13) → -76 +16 -44 -26 = (-76 +16) = -60; -60 -44 = -104; -104 -26 = -130. Correct.\n\nEquation 9: A +C +E +3F +D → -76 + (-84) +49 +3*(-13) + (-22) → -76 -84 = -160; -160 +49 = -111; 3*(-13) = -39; -111 -39 = -150; -150 -22 = -172. Correct.\n\nAll equations are satisfied. Great! So the values are:\n\n⊗ = -76\n\n@ = 8\n\n∂ = -84\n\n? = -22\n\n⊕ = 49\n\n♥ = -13\n\nNow, the next step is to compute the sum of each column. Since the grid has 7 columns, we need to calculate the sum for each of the 7 columns.\n\nLet me reconstruct the grid with the symbols replaced by their numerical values.\n\nOriginal grid:\n\nRow 1: ⊗ @ ∂ ? ? ⊗ ∂ → -76, 8, -84, -22, -22, -76, -84\n\nRow 2: @ ⊗ ∂ ∂ ? ? ⊕ → 8, -76, -84, -84, -22, -22, 49\n\nRow 3: ⊗ ⊕ ∂ ♥ @ ⊗ ⊕ → -76, 49, -84, -13, 8, -76, 49\n\nRow 4: ? ? ♥ ? @ @ ♥ → -22, -22, -13, -22, 8, 8, -13\n\nRow 5: ⊗ @ ⊗ @ ⊗ ⊕ ♥ → -76, 8, -76, 8, -76, 49, -13\n\nRow 6: ⊗ ♥ @ @ ⊕ ∂ ⊗ → -76, -13, 8, 8, 49, -84, -76\n\nRow 7: ⊕ ⊕ ∂ ♥ ? ♥ ∂ → 49, 49, -84, -13, -22, -13, -84\n\nRow 8: ⊗ ? @ @ ♥ ? ♥ → -76, -22, 8, 8, -13, -22, -13\n\nRow 9: ∂ ⊗ ⊕ ♥ ♥ ♥ ? → -84, -76, 49, -13, -13, -13, -22\n\nNow, let's list each column's elements:\n\nColumn 1: Row1[0], Row2[0], Row3[0], Row4[0], Row5[0], Row6[0], Row7[0], Row8[0], Row9[0]\n\nWait, each row has 7 elements.

      "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to find the sum of each column in a grid where each symbol represents a numerical value. We're given the sum of each row, which might help us figure out the individual symbol values first. Once we have those, calculating the column sums should be straightforward.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the grid provided. Each row has a series of symbols followed by a number which is the sum of that row. The symbols are: ♠, ∫, ♣, ^, ≥, %, and maybe others. Let's list out the rows and their sums:\n\nRow 1: ♠∫♠∫^♣♠ → 304\nRow 2: ♣^♣♣∫≥♠ → 115\nRow 3: ∫♣♠∫≥♣♣ → 58\nRow 4: %♠♣%♠%^ → 83\nRow 5: ♣≥♠♣♠%^ → 80\nRow 6: ♣∫%^∫≥≥ → -37\nRow 7: ♠≥^≥♣♠^ → 112\nRow 8: ≥^^♣♣∫♠ → 196\nRow 9: ^≥♣♣≥≥% → -180\n\nEach row has 7 symbols, so there are 7 columns. The goal is to find the sum of each column.\n\nBut how do we find the value of each symbol? Since each row's sum is known, perhaps we can set up equations for each row and solve the system of equations to find the value of each symbol.\n\nLet me denote each symbol as a variable:\n\nLet’s assign variables:\n\nLet’s say:\nA = ♠\nB = ∫\nC = ♣\nD = ^\nE = ≥\nF = %\nG = ?\n\nWait, looking at the symbols in the grid, I need to check all unique symbols. Let me list all symbols present:\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\nRow 1: ♠, ∫, ^, ♣\nRow 2: ♣, ^, ∫, ≥, ♠\nRow 3: ∫, ♣, ♠, ≥, ♣\nRow 4: %, ♠, ♣, %, ♠, ^, %\nRow 5: ♣, ≥, ♠, ♣, ♠, %, ^\nRow 6: ♣, ∫, %, ^, ∫, ≥, ≥\nRow 7: ♠, ≥, ^, ≥, ♣, ♠, ^\nRow 8: ≥, ^, ^, ♣, ♣, ∫, ♠\nRow 9: ^, ≥, ♣, ♣, ≥, ≥, %\n\nSo the symbols are: ♠, ∫, ♣, ^, ≥, %.\n\nWait, row 4 has three % symbols, and others have some. So total symbols are six: A=♠, B=∫, C=♣, D=^, E=≥, F=%.\n\nSo there are 6 different symbols. But each row has 7 symbols. That suggests that some rows might have repeated symbols. For example, row 1 has ♠∫♠∫^♣♠. Let's count the symbols per row:\n\nRow 1: 7 symbols. Let's check each row:\n\nRow 1: 7 symbols. Let's count each symbol in each row and create equations.\n\nBut since there are 9 rows, each with 7 symbols, and 6 variables, we can set up 9 equations. However, solving a system with 6 variables and 9 equations might be possible if the equations are consistent.\n\nLet me try to create equations for each row.\n\nLet me first note each row's symbols and their counts, then form equations.\n\nRow 1: ♠∫♠∫^♣♠ → symbols are A, B, A, B, D, C, A. So counts: A:3, B:2, C:1, D:1. Equation: 3A + 2B + C + D = 304.\n\nRow 2: ♣^♣♣∫≥♠ → symbols C, D, C, C, B, E, A. Counts: C:3, D:1, B:1, E:1, A:1. Equation: 3C + D + B + E + A = 115.\n\nRow 3: ∫♣♠∫≥♣♣ → B, C, A, B, E, C, C. Counts: B:2, C:3, A:1, E:1. Equation: 2B + 3C + A + E = 58.\n\nRow 4: %♠♣%♠%^ → F, A, C, F, A, D, F. Counts: F:3, A:2, C:1, D:1. Equation: 3F + 2A + C + D = 83.\n\nRow 5: ♣≥♠♣♠%^ → C, E, A, C, A, F, D. Counts: C:2, E:1, A:2, F:1, D:1. Equation: 2C + E + 2A + F + D = 80.\n\nRow 6: ♣∫%^∫≥≥ → C, B, F, D, B, E, E. Counts: C:1, B:2, F:1, D:1, E:2. Equation: C + 2B + F + D + 2E = -37.\n\nRow 7: ♠≥^≥♣♠^ → A, E, D, E, C, A, D. Counts: A:2, E:2, D:2, C:1. Equation: 2A + 2E + 2D + C = 112.\n\nRow 8: ≥^^♣♣∫♠ → E, D, D, C, C, B, A. Counts: E:1, D:2, C:2, B:1, A:1. Equation: E + 2D + 2C + B + A = 196.\n\nRow 9: ^≥♣♣≥≥% → D, E, C, C, E, E, F. Counts: D:1, E:3, C:2, F:1. Equation: D + 3E + 2C + F = -180.\n\nSo now we have 9 equations:\n\n1. 3A + 2B + C + D = 304\n2. A + 3C + D + B + E = 115\n3. A + 2B + 3C + E = 58\n4. 3F + 2A + C + D = 83\n5. 2A + 2C + E + F + D = 80\n6. C + 2B + F + D + 2E = -37\n7. 2A + C + 2E + 2D = 112\n8. A + B + 2C + 2D + E = 196\n9. D + 3E + 2C + F = -180\n\nNow, we have 9 equations with 6 variables (A, B, C, D, E, F). Let's see if we can solve this system.\n\nFirst, perhaps we can find equations that can be combined. Let's start by looking for equations that can be subtracted or substituted.\n\nLooking at equations 1 and 2. Let me write them again:\n\nEquation 1: 3A + 2B + C + D = 304\n\nEquation 2: A + B + 3C + D + E = 115\n\nEquation 3: A + 2B + 3C + E = 58\n\nEquation 4: 2A + C + D + 3F = 83\n\nEquation 5: 2A + 2C + E + D + F = 80\n\nEquation 6: 2B + C + D + F + 2E = -37\n\nEquation 7: 2A + C + 2E + 2D = 112\n\nEquation 8: A + B + 2C + 2D + E = 196\n\nEquation 9: D + 2C + 3E + F = -180\n\nHmm. Let me try to solve step by step.\n\nFirst, perhaps we can find expressions for variables in terms of others.\n\nLooking at equations 2 and 3. Let's subtract equation 3 from equation 2:\n\nEquation 2: A + B + 3C + D + E = 115\n\nEquation 3: A + 2B + 3C + E = 58\n\nSubtract 3 from 2:\n\n(A + B + 3C + D + E) - (A + 2B + 3C + E) = 115 - 58\n\nSimplify:\n\n(A - A) + (B - 2B) + (3C - 3C) + D + (E - E) = 57\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n- B + D = 57 → D = B + 57. Let's note that as equation (a).\n\nSo D = B + 57.\n\nNow, let's use equation (a) to substitute D in other equations.\n\nEquation 1: 3A + 2B + C + D = 304 → 3A + 2B + C + (B +57) = 304 → 3A + 3B + C = 304 -57 = 247 → 3A + 3B + C = 247. Let's call this equation 1a.\n\nEquation 2: A + B + 3C + D + E = 115 → substituting D:\n\nA + B + 3C + (B +57) + E = 115 → A + 2B + 3C + E +57 = 115 → A + 2B + 3C + E = 58. Wait, that's exactly equation 3. So equation 2 and equation 3 are connected through equation (a). So no new info here.\n\nEquation 4: 3F + 2A + C + D = 83 → substituting D:\n\n3F + 2A + C + B +57 = 83 → 3F + 2A + B + C = 83 -57 = 26 → 3F + 2A + B + C = 26. Let's call this equation 4a.\n\nEquation 5: 2A + 2C + E + D + F = 80 → substituting D:\n\n2A + 2C + E + (B +57) + F = 80 → 2A + B + 2C + E + F = 80 -57 = 23. Equation 5a.\n\nEquation 6: 2B + C + D + F + 2E = -37 → substituting D:\n\n2B + C + (B +57) + F + 2E = -37 → 3B + C + F + 2E +57 = -37 → 3B + C + F + 2E = -94. Equation 6a.\n\nEquation 7: 2A + C + 2E + 2D = 112 → substituting D:\n\n2A + C + 2E + 2*(B +57) = 112 → 2A + C + 2E + 2B + 114 = 112 → 2A + 2B + C + 2E = -2. Equation 7a.\n\nEquation 8: A + B + 2C + 2D + E = 196 → substituting D:\n\nA + B + 2C + 2*(B +57) + E = 196 → A + B + 2C + 2B + 114 + E = 196 → A + 3B + 2C + E = 82. Equation 8a.\n\nEquation 9: D + 2C + 3E + F = -180 → substituting D:\n\n(B +57) + 2C + 3E + F = -180 → B + 2C + 3E + F +57 = -180 → B + 2C + 3E + F = -237. Equation 9a.\n\nNow, let's list all the equations after substitution:\n\n1a: 3A + 3B + C = 247\n\n4a: 3F + 2A + B + C = 26\n\n5a: 2A + B + 2C + E + F = 23\n\n6a: 3B + C + F + 2E = -94\n\n7a: 2A + 2B + C + 2E = -2\n\n8a: A + 3B + 2C + E = 82\n\n9a: B + 2C + 3E + F = -237\n\nNow, we have 7 equations (1a, 4a, 5a, 6a, 7a, 8a, 9a) with variables A, B, C, E, F. Wait, D is already expressed in terms of B via equation (a). So we have 5 variables (A, B, C, E, F) and 7 equations. Let's see how to proceed.\n\nLet me try to find expressions for variables. Let's look for equations that can be combined.\n\nLooking at equation 8a: A + 3B + 2C + E = 82. Let's denote this as equation 8a.\n\nEquation 7a: 2A + 2B + C + 2E = -2.\n\nPerhaps we can express A from equation 8a in terms of others and substitute into equation 7a.\n\nFrom equation 8a: A = 82 - 3B - 2C - E. Let's call this equation (b).\n\nSubstitute into equation 7a:\n\n2*(82 - 3B - 2C - E) + 2B + C + 2E = -2\n\nCompute:\n\n164 -6B -4C -2E + 2B + C + 2E = -2\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n164 -4B -3C = -2 → -4B -3C = -2 -164 = -166 → 4B + 3C = 166. Let's call this equation (c).\n\nNow, equation 1a: 3A + 3B + C = 247. Using equation (b) for A:\n\n3*(82 - 3B - 2C - E) + 3B + C = 247\n\nCompute:\n\n246 -9B -6C -3E + 3B + C = 247 → 246 -6B -5C -3E = 247 → -6B -5C -3E = 1 → 6B + 5C + 3E = -1. Equation (d).\n\nNow, let's see if we can find more equations.\n\nLooking at equation 5a: 2A + B + 2C + E + F = 23. Substitute A from (b):\n\n2*(82 - 3B - 2C - E) + B + 2C + E + F = 23\n\nCompute:\n\n164 -6B -4C -2E + B + 2C + E + F = 23 → 164 -5B -2C -E + F = 23 → -5B -2C -E + F = -141 → F = 5B + 2C + E -141. Equation (e).\n\nNow, equation 4a: 3F + 2A + B + C = 26. Substitute A from (b) and F from (e):\n\n3*(5B + 2C + E -141) + 2*(82 - 3B - 2C - E) + B + C = 26\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\nFirst term: 3*(5B + 2C + E -141) = 15B + 6C + 3E - 423\n\nSecond term: 2*(82 -3B -2C -E) = 164 -6B -4C -2E\n\nThird term: B + C.\n\nAdding all together:\n\n15B +6C +3E -423 +164 -6B -4C -2E + B + C = 26\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(15B -6B + B) + (6C -4C + C) + (3E -2E) + (-423 +164) = 26\n\nSo:\n\n10B + 3C + E -259 = 26 → 10B +3C + E = 26 +259 = 285. Equation (f).\n\nNow, equation (d) is 6B +5C +3E = -1.\n\nEquation (f) is 10B +3C + E = 285.\n\nLet me see if we can find relations between these. Let's try to eliminate E. Multiply equation (f) by 3:\n\n30B +9C +3E = 855.\n\nSubtract equation (d) from this:\n\n(30B +9C +3E) - (6B +5C +3E) = 855 - (-1)\n\nWhich gives:\n\n24B +4C = 856 → 6B + C = 214. Let's call this equation (g).\n\nSo 6B + C = 214. From equation (g).\n\nNow, equation (c) is 4B +3C = 166.\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n(g): 6B + C = 214\n\n(c): 4B + 3C = 166\n\nLet me solve these two equations for B and C.\n\nFrom (g): C = 214 -6B.\n\nSubstitute into (c):\n\n4B + 3*(214 -6B) = 166 → 4B + 642 -18B = 166 → -14B = 166 -642 = -476 → B = (-476)/(-14) = 34.\n\nSo B = 34.\n\nThen, from (g): 6*34 + C = 214 → 204 + C = 214 → C = 10.\n\nSo B=34, C=10.\n\nNow, let's find D from equation (a): D = B +57 = 34 +57 = 91.\n\nNow, with B=34, C=10, D=91, let's find other variables.\n\nFrom equation (g): done.\n\nNow, let's go back to equation (f): 10B +3C + E = 285.\n\nSubstituting B=34, C=10:\n\n10*34 +3*10 + E = 285 → 340 +30 + E = 285 → 370 + E = 285 → E = 285 - 370 = -85.\n\nSo E = -85.\n\nNow, from equation (e): F = 5B + 2C + E -141.\n\nSubstituting B=34, C=10, E=-85:\n\nF = 5*34 + 2*10 + (-85) -141 = 170 +20 -85 -141 = (170+20) - (85+141) = 190 -226 = -36.\n\nSo F = -36.\n\nNow, let's check if these values are consistent with other equations.\n\nLet me check equation (d): 6B +5C +3E = -1.\n\n6*34 = 204, 5*10=50, 3*(-85)= -255. Sum: 204 +50 -255 = (254) -255 = -1. Correct. So equation (d) holds.\n\nNow, let's check equation (c): 4B +3C = 166. 4*34=136, 3*10=30. 136+30=166. Correct.\n\nNow, let's check equation 8a: A + 3B + 2C + E = 82.\n\nFrom equation (b): A = 82 -3B -2C -E. Let's compute A.\n\nSubstituting B=34, C=10, E=-85:\n\nA = 82 -3*34 -2*10 - (-85) = 82 -102 -20 +85 = (82 +85) - (102+20) = 167 -122 = 45.\n\nSo A=45.\n\nNow let's check equation 1a: 3A +3B +C = 247.\n\n3*45 +3*34 +10 = 135 +102 +10 = 247. Correct.\n\nNow, let's check equation 4a: 3F +2A +B +C = 26. F=-36, A=45, B=34, C=10.\n\n3*(-36) + 2*45 +34 +10 = -108 +90 +34 +10 = (-108 +90) + (34+10) = -18 +44 = 26. Correct.\n\nEquation 5a: 2A + B +2C + E + F = 23. Let's compute:\n\n2*45 +34 +2*10 + (-85) + (-36) = 90 +34 +20 -85 -36.\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n90+34=124; 124+20=144; 144-85=59; 59-36=23. Correct.\n\nEquation 6a: 3B + C + F + 2E = -94.\n\n3*34 +10 + (-36) + 2*(-85) = 102 +10 -36 -170 = (112 -36) -170 = 76 -170 = -94. Correct.\n\nEquation 7a: 2A +2B +C +2E = -2.\n\n2*45 +2*34 +10 +2*(-85) = 90 +68 +10 -170 = (168) -170 = -2. Correct.\n\nEquation 9a: B + 2C +3E +F = -237.\n\n34 + 2*10 +3*(-85) + (-36) = 34 +20 -255 -36 = 54 -291 = -237. Correct.\n\nSo all equations check out. Now we have the values of all variables:\n\nA (♠) = 45\n\nB (∫) = 34\n\nC (♣) = 10\n\nD (^) = 91\n\nE (≥) = -85\n\nF (%) = -36\n\nNow, with these values, we can compute the column sums. The grid has 7 columns, so we need to find the sum of each column.\n\nTo do this, let's look at each column in the grid and sum the values of the symbols in that column across all rows.\n\nBut since the grid is given row-wise, we need to extract the symbols in each column.\n\nLet me reconstruct the grid row by row, then for each column, collect the symbols from each row, then sum them.\n\nLet me list each row's symbols again:\n\nRow 1: ♠ ∫ ♠ ∫ ^ ♣ ♠ → [A, B, A, B, D, C, A]\n\nRow 2: ♣ ^ ♣ ♣ ∫ ≥ ♠ → [C, D, C, C, B, E, A]\n\nRow 3: ∫ ♣ ♠ ∫ ≥ ♣ ♣ → [B, C, A, B, E, C, C]\n\nRow 4: % ♠ ♣ % ♠ % ^ → [F, A, C, F, A, F, D]\n\nRow 5: ♣ ≥ ♠ ♣ ♠ % ^ → [C, E, A, C, A, F, D]\n\nRow 6: ♣ ∫ % ^ ∫ ≥ ≥ → [C, B, F, D, B, E, E]\n\nRow 7: ♠ ≥ ^ ≥ ♣ ♠ ^ → [A, E, D, E, C, A, D]\n\nRow 8: ≥ ^ ^ ♣ ♣ ∫ ♠ → [E, D, D, C, C, B, A]\n\nRow 9: ^ ≥ ♣ ♣ ≥ ≥ % → [D, E, C, C, E, E, F]\n\nNow, the columns are:\n\nColumn 1: Row1[0], Row2[0], Row3[0], Row4[0], Row5[0], Row6[0], Row7[0], Row8[0], Row9[0]\n\nWait, each row has 7 symbols, so there are 7 columns. Let me index them as columns 0 to 6 (assuming 0-based index).\n\nSo for each column index from 0 to 6, collect the symbols from each row.\n\nLet me create a list for each column:\n\nColumn 0:\n\nRow1: ♠ (A)\nRow2: ♣ (C)\nRow3: ∫ (B)\nRow4: % (F)\nRow5: ♣ (C)\nRow6: ♣ (C)\nRow7: ♠ (A)\nRow8: ≥ (E)\nRow9: ^ (D)\n\nColumn 0 symbols: A, C, B, F, C, C, A, E, D\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow1: ∫ (B)\nRow2: ^ (D)\nRow3: ♣ (C)\nRow4: ♠ (A)\nRow5: ≥ (E)\nRow6: ∫ (B)\nRow7: ≥ (E)\nRow8: ^ (D)\nRow9: ≥ (E)\n\nSymbols: B, D, C, A, E, B, E, D, E\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow1: ♠ (A)\nRow2: ♣ (C)\nRow3: ♠ (A)\nRow4: ♣ (C)\nRow5: ♠ (A)\nRow6: % (F)\nRow7: ^ (D)\nRow8: ^ (D)\nRow9: ♣ (C)\n\nSymbols: A, C, A, C, A, F, D, D, C\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow1: ∫ (B)\nRow2: ♣ (C)\nRow3: ∫ (B)\nRow4: % (F)\nRow5: ♣ (C)\nRow6: ^ (D)\nRow7: ≥ (E)\nRow8: ♣ (C)\nRow9: ♣ (C)\n\nSymbols: B, C, B, F, C, D, E, C, C\n\nColumn 4:\n\nRow1: ^ (D)\nRow2: ∫ (B)\nRow3: ≥ (E)\nRow4: ♠ (A)\nRow5: ♠ (A)\nRow6: ∫ (B)\nRow7: ♣ (C)\nRow8: ♣ (C)\nRow9: ≥ (E)\n\nSymbols: D, B, E, A, A, B, C, C, E\n\nColumn 5:\n\nRow1: ♣ (C)\nRow2: ≥ (E)\nRow3: ♣ (C)\nRow4: % (F)\nRow5: % (F)\nRow6: ≥ (E)\nRow7: ♠ (A)\nRow8: ∫ (B)\nRow9: ≥ (E)\n\nSymbols: C, E, C, F, F, E, A, B, E\n\nColumn 6:\n\nRow1: ♠ (A)\nRow2: ♠ (A)\nRow3: ♣ (C)\nRow4: ^ (D)\nRow5: ^ (D)\nRow6: ≥ (E)\nRow7: ^ (D)\nRow8: ♠ (A)\nRow9: % (F)\n\nSymbols: A, A, C, D, D, E, D, A, F\n\nNow, for each column, sum the values using the variables we found.\n\nLet me compute each column's sum:\n\nFirst, let's note the values:\n\nA=45, B=34, C=10, D=91, E=-85, F=-36.\n\nColumn 0:\n\nA + C + B + F + C + C + A + E + D\n\n= 45 + 10 +34 + (-36) +10 +10 +45 + (-85) +91\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nStart with 45 (A)\n\nAdd 10 (C): 55\n\nAdd 34 (B): 89\n\nAdd -36 (F): 89 -36 = 53\n\nAdd 10 (C): 63\n\nAdd 10 (C): 73\n\nAdd 45 (A): 118\n\nAdd -85 (E): 118 -85 = 33\n\nAdd 91 (D): 33 +91 = 124.\n\nSo Column 0 sum: 124.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nB + D + C + A + E + B + E + D + E\n\n= 34 +91 +10 +45 + (-85) +34 + (-85) +91 + (-85)\n\nLet me compute:\n\nStart with 34 (B)\n\nAdd 91 (D): 125\n\nAdd 10 (C): 135\n\nAdd 45 (A): 180\n\nAdd -85 (E): 95\n\nAdd 34 (B): 129\n\nAdd -85 (E): 44\n\nAdd 91 (D): 135\n\nAdd -85 (E): 50.\n\nSo Column 1 sum: 50.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nA + C + A + C + A + F + D + D + C\n\n= 45 +10 +45 +10 +45 + (-36) +91 +91 +10\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n45 +10 =55; +45=100; +10=110; +45=155; -36=119; +91=210; +91=301; +10=311.\n\nSo Column 2 sum: 311.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nB + C + B + F + C + D + E + C + C\n\n=34 +10 +34 + (-36) +10 +91 + (-85) +10 +10\n\nCompute:\n\n34 +10=44; +34=78; -36=42; +10=52; +91=143; -85=58; +10=68; +10=78.\n\nColumn 3 sum: 78.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nD + B + E + A + A + B + C + C + E\n\n=91 +34 + (-85) +45 +45 +34 +10 +10 + (-85)\n\nCompute:\n\n91 +34=125; -85=40; +45=85; +45=130; +34=164; +10=174; +10=184; -85=99.\n\nColumn 4 sum: 99.\n\nColumn 5:\n\nC + E + C + F + F + E + A + B + E\n\n=10 + (-85) +10 + (-36) + (-36) + (-85) +45 +34 + (-85)\n\nCompute:\n\n10 -85 = -75 +10 = -65 -36 = -101 -36 = -137 -85 = -222 +45 = -177 +34 = -143 -85 = -228.\n\nSo Column 5 sum: -228.\n\nColumn 6:\n\nA + A + C + D + D + E + D + A + F\n\n=45 +45 +10 +91 +91 + (-85) +91 +45 + (-36)\n\nCompute:\n\n45+45=90 +10=100 +91=191 +91=282 -85=197 +91=288 +45=333 -36=297.\n\nColumn 6 sum: 297.\n\nSo the column sums are:\n\nColumn 0: 124\n\nColumn 1: 50\n\nColumn 2: 311\n\nColumn 3: 78\n\nColumn 4: 99\n\nColumn 5: -228\n\nColumn 6: 297\n\nTherefore, the answer should be [124, 50, 311, 78, 99, -228, 297].\n\nLet me verify these sums with another approach to ensure no calculation errors.\n\nAlternative approach: Since each row's sum is known, the total sum of all elements in the grid can be calculated by adding all the row sums.

So this is a good sign that the column sums are correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is [124, 50, 311, 78, 99, -228, 297].\n ;Answer: [124, 50, 311, 78, 99, -228, 297]"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the column sums based on the given grid and row sums. The grid has symbols like ∏, $, ∆, ∅, ∵, +, ∫, and maybe others. Each symbol represents a numerical value. The rows are provided with their total sums, and I have to compute the column sums and output them as a list.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grid is structured. Each row has eight symbols, and there are ten rows. Let me check that. Let me count the symbols in the first row: ∏, $, ∆, ∅, ∵, ∵, +, ∵. That's eight symbols. Each row seems to have eight symbols. So the grid is 10 rows by 8 columns. The task is to find the sum for each of the 8 columns.\n\nBut how do I approach this? Since each row's sum is given, maybe there's a system of equations here. Each symbol is a variable, and each row gives an equation. However, with 8 symbols, but 10 equations, perhaps there's redundancy. But solving a system of equations with 8 variables and 10 equations might be possible if the equations are consistent.\n\nWait, but the problem says that each symbol represents a numerical value. So I need to find the value of each symbol first, then multiply by how many times they appear in each column and sum them up. But solving for 8 variables with 10 equations... that's possible, but maybe there's some dependencies. Let me think.\n\nLet me list out each row's symbols and their corresponding total. Let me start by assigning variables to each symbol. Let's assign:\n\nLet me think of each unique symbol. The symbols present are: ∏, $, ∆, ∅, ∵, +, ∫. Wait, let me check all rows:\n\nFirst row: ∏, $, ∆, ∅, ∵, ∵, +, ∵. So symbols here are ∏, $, ∆, ∅, ∵, +.\n\nSecond row: ∅, +, ∆, $, ∆, $, ∵, ∅. So symbols ∅, +, ∆, $, ∵.\n\nThird row: ∵, $, ∫, ∅, ∆, ∆, ∵, $. Symbols ∵, $, ∫, ∅, ∆.\n\nFourth row: ∫, ∏, +, ∫, +, ∵, ∏, ∵. Symbols ∫, ∏, +, ∵.\n\nFifth row: ∆, +, ∏, ∅, $, ∆, ∫, ∵. Symbols ∆, +, ∏, ∅, $, ∫, ∵.\n\nSixth row: ∆, ∅, ∆, ∵, +, ∅, ∏, $. Symbols ∆, ∅, ∵, +, ∏, $.\n\nSeventh row: ∵, ∏, ∫, +, ∅, ∏, ∵, ∅. Symbols ∵, ∏, ∫, +, ∅.\n\nEighth row: $, ∆, ∏, ∫, +, +, $, ∅. Symbols $, ∆, ∏, ∫, +, ∅.\n\nNinth row: ∫, $, ∆, ∆, $, ∫, ∅, ∫. Symbols ∫, $, ∆, ∅.\n\nTenth row: ∏, ∆, ∫, ∏, $, ∫, +, ∅. Symbols ∏, ∆, ∫, $, +, ∅.\n\nSo all symbols are: ∏, $, ∆, ∅, ∵, +, ∫. That's seven symbols. Wait, maybe I missed one? Let me check again. No, seems like seven. Let me confirm:\n\nLooking through all rows, symbols are:\n\n- ∏\n- $\n- ∆\n- ∅\n- ∵\n- +\n- ∫\n\nYes, seven symbols. So seven variables. And ten equations (each row's sum). So the system should be solvable.\n\nLet me denote each symbol with a variable:\n\nLet me assign:\n\nA = ∏\n\nB = $\n\nC = ∆\n\nD = ∅\n\nE = ∵\n\nF = +\n\nG = ∫\n\nSo each symbol corresponds to a variable. Now, each row's equation can be written as a linear combination of these variables, equal to the given row sum.\n\nLet me list each row's equation:\n\nRow 1: A + B + C + D + E + E + F + E = -178 → A + B + C + D + 3E + F = -178\n\nRow 2: D + F + C + B + C + B + E + D = -59 → D + F + 2C + 2B + E + D = -59 → 2D + 2B + 2C + E + F = -59\n\nRow 3: E + B + G + D + C + C + E + B = -190 → E + B + G + D + 2C + E + B = -190 → 2B + D + 2C + 2E + G = -190\n\nRow 4: G + A + F + G + F + E + A + E = -204 → G + A + F + G + F + E + A + E = -204 → 2A + 2G + 2F + 2E = -204 → Simplify: A + G + F + E = -102\n\nRow 5: C + F + A + D + B + C + G + E = -143 → C + F + A + D + B + C + G + E = -143 → A + B + D + 2C + E + F + G = -143\n\nRow 6: C + D + C + E + F + D + A + B = -69 → C + D + C + E + F + D + A + B = -69 → A + B + 2C + 2D + E + F = -69\n\nRow 7: E + A + G + F + D + A + E + D = -95 → E + A + G + F + D + A + E + D = -95 → 2A + 2D + 2E + F + G = -95\n\nRow 8: B + C + A + G + F + F + B + D = -54 → B + C + A + G + F + F + B + D = -54 → A + 2B + C + D + 2F + G = -54\n\nRow 9: G + B + C + C + B + G + D + G = -154 → G + B + C + C + B + G + D + G = -154 → 3G + 2B + 2C + D = -154\n\nRow 10: A + C + G + A + B + G + F + D = -103 → A + C + G + A + B + G + F + D = -103 → 2A + B + C + D + 2G + F = -103\n\nSo now, I have ten equations with seven variables.

Now I need to solve this system. Let me try to find relations between equations.\n\nFirst, perhaps I can use equation 4 to express A in terms of other variables. Let's rearrange equation 4:\n\nA = -102 - E - F - G.\n\nThen substitute A into other equations where A appears.\n\nLooking at equations 1, 5, 6, 7, 10.\n\nLet me start with equation 1:\n\nEquation 1: A + B + C + D + 3E + F = -178\n\nSubstitute A:\n\n(-102 - E - F - G) + B + C + D + 3E + F = -178\n\nSimplify:\n\n-102 - E - F - G + B + C + D + 3E + F = -178\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-102 + B + C + D + ( -E + 3E ) + (-F + F) - G = -178\n\nWhich is:\n\n-102 + B + C + D + 2E - G = -178\n\nRearranged:\n\nB + C + D + 2E - G = -178 + 102 = -76 → Equation 1a: B + C + D + 2E - G = -76\n\nSimilarly, equation 5: A + B + D + 2C + E + F + G = -143\n\nSubstitute A:\n\n(-102 - E - F - G) + B + D + 2C + E + F + G = -143\n\nSimplify:\n\n-102 - E - F - G + B + D + 2C + E + F + G = -143\n\nCombine terms:\n\n-102 + B + D + 2C + (-E + E) + (-F + F) + (-G + G) = -143 → \n\n-102 + B + D + 2C = -143 → B + D + 2C = -143 + 102 = -41 → Equation 5a: B + D + 2C = -41\n\nEquation 6: A + B + 2C + 2D + E + F = -69\n\nSubstitute A:\n\n(-102 - E - F - G) + B + 2C + 2D + E + F = -69\n\nSimplify:\n\n-102 - E - F - G + B + 2C + 2D + E + F = -69 → \n\n-102 + B + 2C + 2D - G = -69 → B + 2C + 2D - G = -69 + 102 = 33 → Equation 6a: B + 2C + 2D - G = 33\n\nEquation 7: 2A + 2D + 2E + F + G = -95\n\nSubstitute A:\n\n2*(-102 - E - F - G) + 2D + 2E + F + G = -95\n\nExpand:\n\n-204 - 2E - 2F - 2G + 2D + 2E + F + G = -95\n\nSimplify:\n\n-204 -2F -2G + 2D + F + G = -95 → \n\n-204 + 2D - F - G = -95 → 2D - F - G = -95 + 204 = 109 → Equation 7a: 2D - F - G = 109\n\nEquation 10: 2A + B + C + D + F + 2G = -103\n\nSubstitute A:\n\n2*(-102 - E - F - G) + B + C + D + F + 2G = -103\n\nExpand:\n\n-204 - 2E - 2F - 2G + B + C + D + F + 2G = -103\n\nSimplify:\n\n-204 -2E -2F -2G + B + C + D + F + 2G → \n\n-204 -2E - F + B + C + D = -103 → \n\nB + C + D - 2E - F = -103 + 204 = 101 → Equation 10a: B + C + D - 2E - F = 101\n\nNow, let me note the equations I have after substitution:\n\nEquation 1a: B + C + D + 2E - G = -76\n\nEquation 5a: B + D + 2C = -41\n\nEquation 6a: B + 2C + 2D - G = 33\n\nEquation 7a: 2D - F - G = 109\n\nEquation 10a: B + C + D - 2E - F = 101\n\nAlso, equation 4 is already used.\n\nNow, let me look at equations 5a and 6a. Let me see if I can find relations between them.\n\nEquation 5a: B + D + 2C = -41\n\nEquation 6a: B + 2C + 2D - G = 33\n\nIf I can express G from equation 6a, maybe?\n\nLet me rearrange equation 6a:\n\nG = B + 2C + 2D - 33 → Equation 6b: G = B + 2C + 2D - 33\n\nAlso, equation 1a: B + C + D + 2E - G = -76 → Let's substitute G from equation 6b here.\n\nSo:\n\nB + C + D + 2E - (B + 2C + 2D - 33) = -76\n\nSimplify:\n\nB + C + D + 2E - B - 2C - 2D + 33 = -76 → \n\n(-C - D) + 2E + 33 = -76 → \n\n- C - D + 2E = -76 -33 = -109 → \n\n- C - D + 2E = -109 → Multiply both sides by -1:\n\nC + D - 2E = 109 → Equation 1b: C + D - 2E = 109\n\nNow, let's look at equation 10a: B + C + D - 2E - F = 101\n\nFrom equation 1b: C + D - 2E = 109. Substitute into equation 10a:\n\nB + (C + D - 2E) - F = 101 → B + 109 - F = 101 → \n\nB - F = 101 - 109 → B - F = -8 → Equation 10b: B - F = -8 → F = B + 8 → Equation 10c: F = B + 8\n\nNow, equation 7a: 2D - F - G = 109. Since F = B +8, and G is from equation 6b: G = B + 2C + 2D -33. Substitute into equation 7a:\n\n2D - (B +8) - [B + 2C + 2D -33] = 109\n\nSimplify:\n\n2D - B -8 - B -2C -2D +33 = 109 → \n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(2D -2D) + (-B -B) + (-2C) + (-8 +33) = 109 → \n\n-2B -2C + 25 = 109 → \n\n-2B -2C = 109 -25 = 84 → \n\nDivide both sides by -2:\n\nB + C = -42 → Equation 7b: B + C = -42\n\nNow, equation 5a: B + D + 2C = -41. Let me note that.\n\nAlso, equation 7b: B + C = -42 → So C = -42 - B. Let me use this to express C in terms of B.\n\nC = -42 - B.\n\nNow, substitute C into equation 5a:\n\nB + D + 2*(-42 - B) = -41 → \n\nB + D -84 - 2B = -41 → \n\n- B + D -84 = -41 → \n\n- B + D = -41 +84 = 43 → \n\nD = B + 43 → Equation 5b: D = B +43\n\nNow, equation 1b: C + D - 2E = 109. Since C = -42 - B, D = B +43, substitute:\n\n(-42 - B) + (B +43) -2E = 109 → \n\n(-42 - B + B +43) -2E = 109 → \n\n(1) -2E = 109 → \n\n-2E = 108 → \n\nE = -54 → Equation E: E = -54\n\nNow that E is known, let's note that.\n\nNow, equation 10c: F = B +8.\n\nEquation 6b: G = B + 2C + 2D -33. Since C = -42 - B and D = B +43, substitute:\n\nG = B + 2*(-42 - B) + 2*(B +43) -33 → \n\nB -84 -2B + 2B +86 -33 → \n\nB -84 +86 -33 → \n\nB + ( -84 +86 -33 ) → \n\nB + (-31) → G = B -31 → Equation G: G = B -31\n\nNow, let's look at equation 4: A + E + F + G = -102. Since A is expressed in terms of E, F, G, but perhaps we can find A once we know other variables.\n\nBut let's see if we can find B. Let's check other equations.\n\nLet me check equation 1a: B + C + D + 2E - G = -76. Let's substitute all variables in terms of B.\n\nC = -42 - B, D = B +43, E = -54, G = B -31.\n\nSubstituting into equation 1a:\n\nB + (-42 - B) + (B +43) + 2*(-54) - (B -31) = -76\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nB -42 - B + B +43 -108 - B +31.\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nStart with B.\n\nThen add (-42 - B): B -42 - B = -42.\n\nThen add (B +43): -42 + B +43 = B +1.\n\nThen add 2*(-54) = -108: B +1 -108 = B -107.\n\nThen subtract (B -31): B -107 - B +31 = -76. Which equals -76. So equation 1a is satisfied regardless of B. So this equation doesn't help us find B. So we need another equation.\n\nLet's check equation 3: 2B + D + 2C + 2E + G = -190. Wait, original equation 3 was:\n\nEquation 3: 2B + D + 2C + 2E + G = -190.\n\nBut substituting variables in terms of B:\n\nD = B +43, C = -42 - B, E = -54, G = B -31.\n\nSo:\n\n2B + (B +43) + 2*(-42 - B) + 2*(-54) + (B -31) = -190\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n2B + B +43 -84 -2B -108 + B -31.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(2B + B -2B + B) + (43 -84 -108 -31)\n\n= (2B) + (-170) \n\nSo 2B - 170 = -190 → 2B = -20 → B = -10.\n\nSo B = -10. Great! Now we can find other variables.\n\nSo B = -10.\n\nNow, let's compute C, D, F, G, E.\n\nC = -42 - B = -42 - (-10) = -42 +10 = -32.\n\nD = B +43 = -10 +43 = 33.\n\nE = -54.\n\nF = B +8 = -10 +8 = -2.\n\nG = B -31 = -10 -31 = -41.\n\nNow, check if these values satisfy other equations. Let's check equation 5a: B + D + 2C = -41.\n\nB is -10, D is 33, 2C is 2*(-32) = -64. Sum: -10 +33 -64 = -41. Correct.\n\nEquation 7b: B + C = -10 + (-32) = -42. Correct.\n\nEquation 5b: D = B +43 → 33 = -10 +43. Correct.\n\nNow, check equation 7a: 2D - F - G = 109.\n\nD is 33, F is -2, G is -41.\n\n2*33 = 66. 66 - (-2) - (-41) = 66 +2 +41 = 109. Correct.\n\nNow, check equation 10a: B + C + D -2E -F = ?\n\nB=-10, C=-32, D=33, E=-54, F=-2.\n\nLeft side: -10 + (-32) +33 -2*(-54) - (-2) = (-10 -32 +33) + 108 +2 = (-9) + 110 = 101. Which matches equation 10a. Correct.\n\nNow, check equation 3. Original equation 3 was 2B + D + 2C + 2E + G = -190.\n\n2*(-10) +33 + 2*(-32) + 2*(-54) + (-41) = -20 +33 -64 -108 -41 = (-20 -64 -108 -41) +33 = (-233) +33 = -200. Wait, but equation 3 was supposed to be -190. Wait, this gives -200. That's a problem. Did I make a mistake here?\n\nWait, equation 3 was derived from the third row's equation. Let me recheck.\n\nOriginal equation 3: 2B + D + 2C + 2E + G = -190.\n\nBut substituting the values:\n\nB=-10, D=33, C=-32, E=-54, G=-41.\n\nSo 2*(-10) = -20.\n\nD=33 → -20 +33 = 13.\n\n2C = 2*(-32) = -64 → 13 -64 = -51.\n\n2E = 2*(-54) = -108 → -51 -108 = -159.\n\nG=-41 → -159 -41 = -200. But equation 3 says it should be -190. So discrepancy here. That means I made a mistake in the derivation of equation 3?\n\nWait, original equation 3 came from row 3. Let me recheck that.\n\nOriginal row 3: ∵$∫∅∆∆∵$ sum is -190.\n\nSymbols in row 3: E, B, G, D, C, C, E, B. So E + B + G + D + C + C + E + B = -190.\n\nWhich is 2B + D + 2C + 2E + G. Yes. So equation is 2B + D + 2C + 2E + G = -190.\n\nBut with the current values, that's -200. So there's an inconsistency. Which suggests that there's a mistake in my calculations. Let me check where I might have gone wrong.\n\nEarlier, when solving for B using equation 3, I substituted and got 2B -170 = -190 → 2B = -20 → B=-10. But perhaps I made a mistake in expanding equation 3.\n\nLet me re-express equation 3 substitution step by step.\n\nEquation 3: 2B + D + 2C + 2E + G = -190.\n\nSubstituting D = B +43, C = -42 - B, E=-54, G = B -31.\n\nSo:\n\n2B + (B +43) + 2*(-42 - B) + 2*(-54) + (B -31) = ?\n\nLet me calculate each term:\n\n2B \n\n+ B +43 \n\n+ 2*(-42) + 2*(-B) \n\n+ 2*(-54) \n\n+ B -31 \n\nNow compute each part:\n\n2B + B = 3B\n\nThen +43 \n\nThen 2*(-42) = -84, and 2*(-B) = -2B → total so far: 3B -2B = B, plus 43 -84 = -41.\n\nThen adding 2*(-54) = -108 → total so far: B -41 -108 = B -149.\n\nThen adding B -31: B -149 + B -31 = 2B -180.\n\nSet equal to -190: 2B -180 = -190 → 2B = -10 → B = -5.\n\nOh! I see! Earlier, I must have miscalculated. Let me redo that.\n\nOriginal equation 3 substitution steps:\n\n2B + D + 2C + 2E + G \n\n= 2B + (B +43) + 2*(-42 - B) + 2*(-54) + (B -31)\n\n= 2B + B +43 + (-84 -2B) + (-108) + B -31 \n\nCombine terms:\n\n2B + B -2B + B = 2B \n\nThen constants: 43 -84 -108 -31 = 43 - 84 is -41; -41 -108 is -149; -149 -31 is -180.\n\nSo total equation is 2B -180 = -190 → 2B = -10 → B = -5.\n\nAh! Previously I had mistakenly calculated 2B -170 = -190. But the correct value is 2B -180 = -190, leading to B=-5. That was my mistake earlier. So B is -5, not -10. Let me correct this.\n\nSo B = -5. Now, let's recalculate all variables.\n\nB = -5.\n\nC = -42 - B = -42 - (-5) = -42 +5 = -37.\n\nD = B +43 = -5 +43 = 38.\n\nE = -54.\n\nF = B +8 = -5 +8 = 3.\n\nG = B -31 = -5 -31 = -36.\n\nNow, let's verify equation 3 again:\n\n2B + D + 2C + 2E + G = 2*(-5) +38 + 2*(-37) + 2*(-54) + (-36) \n\n= -10 +38 -74 -108 -36 \n\nCalculate step by step:\n\nStart with -10 +38 = 28.\n\n28 -74 = -46.\n\n-46 -108 = -154.\n\n-154 -36 = -190. Correct. So equation 3 is satisfied.\n\nNow, let's check equation 5a: B + D + 2C = -41.\n\nB=-5, D=38, 2C=2*(-37)=-74.\n\nSum: -5 +38 -74 = -41. Correct.\n\nEquation 7b: B + C = -5 + (-37) = -42. Correct.\n\nEquation 5b: D = B +43 → 38 = -5 +43 = 38. Correct.\n\nEquation 7a: 2D - F - G = 2*38 -3 - (-36) = 76 -3 +36 = 109. Correct.\n\nEquation 10a: B + C + D -2E -F = (-5) + (-37) +38 - 2*(-54) -3 \n\n= (-5 -37 +38) + 108 -3 \n\n= (-4) + 105 = 101. Correct.\n\nNow, equation 1a: B + C + D + 2E - G = ?\n\nB=-5, C=-37, D=38, E=-54, G=-36.\n\n-5 + (-37) +38 + 2*(-54) - (-36) \n\n= (-5 -37 +38) + (-108) +36 \n\n= (-4) -72 = -76. Correct.\n\nSo now, with B=-5, variables are:\n\nA = ?\n\nWe need to find A from equation 4: A + E + F + G = -102.\n\nE=-54, F=3, G=-36.\n\nSo A + (-54) +3 + (-36) = -102 → A -87 = -102 → A = -102 +87 = -15.\n\nSo A = -15.\n\nNow, let's check equation 5: A + B + D + 2C + E + F + G = -143.\n\nA=-15, B=-5, D=38, 2C=2*(-37)=-74, E=-54, F=3, G=-36.\n\nSum: -15 -5 +38 -74 -54 +3 -36 \n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nStart with -15 -5 = -20.\n\n+38 → 18.\n\n-74 → -56.\n\n-54 → -110.\n\n+3 → -107.\n\n-36 → -143. Correct. Equation 5 is satisfied.\n\nNow, let's check equation 6: original equation 6 was A + B + 2C + 2D + E + F = -69.\n\nA=-15, B=-5, 2C= -74, 2D=76, E=-54, F=3.\n\nSum: -15 -5 -74 +76 -54 +3 \n\nCompute:\n\n-15-5 = -20; -20-74=-94; +76 → -18; -54 → -72; +3 → -69. Correct.\n\nNow, equation 1: A + B + C + D + 3E + F = -178.\n\nA=-15, B=-5, C=-37, D=38, 3E=3*(-54)=-162, F=3.\n\nSum: -15 -5 -37 +38 -162 +3 \n\n= (-15-5) = -20; -20 -37 = -57; +38 → -19; -162 → -181; +3 → -178. Correct.\n\nEquation 2: 2B + 2C + 2D + E + F = -59.\n\nB=-5, C=-37, D=38, E=-54, F=3.\n\n2*(-5) = -10; 2*(-37) = -74; 2*38=76. \n\nSum: -10 -74 +76 -54 +3 \n\n= (-84 +76) = -8; -8 -54 = -62; +3 → -59. Correct.\n\nEquation 7: 2A + 2D + 2E + F + G = -95.\n\nA=-15, D=38, E=-54, F=3, G=-36.\n\n2*(-15) = -30; 2*38=76; 2*(-54) = -108.\n\nSum: -30 +76 -108 +3 -36 \n\n= (76 -30) =46; 46-108 = -62; -62 +3 = -59; -59 -36 = -95. Correct.\n\nEquation 8: A + 2B + C + D + 2F + G = -54.\n\nA=-15, 2B=2*(-5)=-10, C=-37, D=38, 2F=6, G=-36.\n\nSum: -15 -10 -37 +38 +6 -36 \n\n= (-15-10) = -25; -25 -37 = -62; +38 → -24; +6 → -18; -36 → -54.

      "Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have a grid with symbols in each row, and each row has a sum given. Our task is to find the sum of each column and output that as a list. Hmm, right. But first, we need to figure out what numerical values each symbol represents. The symbols here are $, @, ⊗, ?, ⊙. Wait, there are five symbols here. But how do we find their values?\n\nLet me think. Each row gives us an equation where the sum of the symbols in that row equals the given number. So if we can set up equations based on these rows, maybe we can solve for each symbol's value. Let's start by listing out each row and the symbols they contain, then count how many of each symbol per row.\n\nFirst, let me parse the grid properly. Each line is a row. Let me list each row's symbols and their sum:\n\nRow 1: $ @ ⊗ $ ⊗ $ ⊗ → Sum is 5\nRow 2: ⊗ ? $ ? ⊗ ? ⊙ → Sum is 233\nRow 3: ⊙ $ $ ⊗ ? ? $ → Sum is -116\nRow 4: ⊙ $ ⊙ ⊗ ⊗ @ ⊙ → Sum is 12\nRow 5: ⊙ ? ⊙ ? $ $ ? → Sum is -73\nRow 6: $ ? @ ⊙ ? ⊗ @ → Sum is 170\n\nNow, let's assign variables to each symbol. Let's say:\n\nLet’s assign variables:\n- Let $ = A\n- @ = B\n- ⊗ = C\n- ? = D\n- ⊙ = E\n\nSo each symbol corresponds to a variable. Now, each row gives us an equation.\n\nLet's write each row's equation:\n\nRow 1: A + B + C + A + C + A + C = 5 → 3A + B + 3C = 5\n\nRow 2: C + D + A + D + C + D + E = 233 → C + A + 3D + C + E = 233 → A + 2C + 3D + E = 233\n\nWait, wait. Let me recount:\n\nRow 2 symbols: ⊗, ?, $, ?, ⊗, ?, ⊙ → that's C, D, A, D, C, D, E. So adding them: C + D + A + D + C + D + E = A + 2C + 3D + E = 233. Correct.\n\nRow 3: ⊙, $, $, ⊗, ?, ?, $ → E + A + A + C + D + D + A → E + 3A + C + 2D = -116.\n\nRow 4: ⊙, $, ⊙, ⊗, ⊗, @, ⊙ → E + A + E + C + C + B + E → 3E + A + 2C + B = 12.\n\nRow 5: ⊙, ?, ⊙, ?, $, $, ? → E + D + E + D + A + A + D → 2E + 3D + 2A = -73.\n\nRow 6: $, ?, @, ⊙, ?, ⊗, @ → A + D + B + E + D + C + B → A + 2B + C + 2D + E = 170.\n\nSo now, we have six equations:\n\n1) 3A + B + 3C = 5  \n2) A + 2C + 3D + E = 233  \n3) 3A + C + 2D + E = -116  \n4) 3E + A + 2C + B = 12  \n5) 2A + 3D + 2E = -73  \n6) A + 2B + C + 2D + E = 170  \n\nNow, we need to solve this system of equations for variables A, B, C, D, E. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, maybe express some equations in terms of others. Let's note that there are five variables and six equations, so maybe there's redundancy, but perhaps we can find a solution.\n\nLet me start by looking at equations that have similar variables. Let's take equations 2, 3, 5, which involve A, D, E, and C.\n\nEquation 2: A + 2C + 3D + E = 233  \nEquation 3: 3A + C + 2D + E = -116  \nEquation 5: 2A + 3D + 2E = -73? Wait no, equation 5 is 2A + 3D + 2E = -73? Wait no, original equation 5 is 2A + 3D + 2E = -73? Let me check again:\n\nEquation 5 was from row 5: 2E + 3D + 2A = -73. Yes, so equation 5 is 2A + 3D + 2E = -73.\n\nHmm. Let me try to find relations between equations.\n\nLet me consider equations 2 and 3. Let me subtract equation 3 from equation 2 multiplied by something. Alternatively, maybe express variables in terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express equations 2 and 3 to eliminate some variables. Let me see.\n\nEquation 2: A + 2C + 3D + E = 233  \nEquation 3: 3A + C + 2D + E = -116  \n\nLet me subtract equation 3 from equation 2? Wait, but they are different. Let me think. Let me denote:\n\nEquation 2: A + 2C + 3D + E = 233  \nEquation 3: 3A + C + 2D + E = -116  \n\nIf I subtract equation 3 from equation 2? Wait, not directly. Let me try to find a way to eliminate variables.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express E from equation 2 and equation 3.\n\nFrom equation 2: E = 233 - A - 2C - 3D  \nFrom equation 3: E = -116 - 3A - C - 2D  \n\nSet them equal:\n\n233 - A - 2C - 3D = -116 -3A - C - 2D  \nLet me rearrange:\n\n233 + 116 = -3A - C -2D + A + 2C + 3D  \n349 = (-2A + C + D)  \nSo 2A - C - D = -349  \nWait, let me check:\n\nLeft side: 233 - A -2C -3D  \nRight side: -116 -3A -C -2D  \nSet equal: 233 - A -2C -3D = -116 -3A -C -2D  \nBring all terms to left:\n\n233 - A -2C -3D +116 +3A +C +2D = 0  \nCombine like terms:\n\n(233 + 116) + (-A +3A) + (-2C + C) + (-3D + 2D) = 0  \n349 + 2A - C - D = 0  \nSo 2A - C - D = -349  \nWait no, 349 + 2A - C - D = 0 → 2A - C - D = -349. Correct.\n\nSo equation (2-3): 2A - C - D = -349. Let's call this equation 7.\n\nNow, equation 5 is 2A + 3D + 2E = -73. Hmm. But we can express E from equation 2 or 3. Let's use equation 2's E expression. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use equation 7 and equation 5. But equation 5 also has E. Let me see if I can find another relation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps look at equations involving other variables. Let's look at equation 1: 3A + B + 3C = 5. Equation 4: 3E + A + 2C + B = 12. Maybe we can combine these equations.\n\nFrom equation 1: B = 5 - 3A - 3C. Let's substitute this into equation 4.\n\nEquation 4 becomes: 3E + A + 2C + (5 - 3A - 3C) = 12  \nSimplify: 3E + A + 2C +5 -3A -3C = 12  \nCombine like terms: 3E - 2A - C +5 = 12 → 3E -2A -C = 7 → equation 8.\n\nNow, equation 8: 3E = 2A + C +7 → E = (2A + C +7)/3.\n\nHmm. Also, from equation 7: 2A - C - D = -349 → D = 2A - C + 349. Let's call this equation 7a.\n\nNow, let's substitute D from equation 7a into equation 2's expression for E.\n\nEquation 2: E = 233 - A -2C -3D. Substitute D:\n\nE = 233 - A -2C -3*(2A - C + 349)  \n= 233 - A -2C -6A +3C - 1047  \nCombine terms:\n\n233 -1047 = -814  \n-A -6A = -7A  \n-2C +3C = +C  \nSo E = -7A + C -814. \n\nBut from equation 8, E is also (2A + C +7)/3. Therefore, equate these two expressions for E:\n\n-7A + C -814 = (2A + C +7)/3  \nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n-21A + 3C -2442 = 2A + C +7  \nBring all terms to left:\n\n-21A +3C -2442 -2A -C -7 = 0  \nCombine:\n\n-23A + 2C -2449 = 0  \n→ -23A +2C = 2449  \n→ 2C = 23A +2449  \n→ C = (23A +2449)/2 → equation 9.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me see if I can find another equation to plug in. Let's also look at equation 5, which is 2A +3D +2E = -73. Let's substitute D from equation 7a and E from equation 8's expression.\n\nWait, equation 8 gives E in terms of A and C. Let me use equation 8's E expression. Also, D is 2A - C + 349 from equation 7a.\n\nSo equation 5: 2A +3D +2E = -73.\n\nSubstitute D and E:\n\n2A +3*(2A - C + 349) + 2*[(2A + C +7)/3] = -73\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\nFirst term: 2A  \nSecond term: 3*(2A - C + 349) = 6A -3C + 1047  \nThird term: 2*(2A + C +7)/3 = (4A + 2C +14)/3\n\nAdding all together:\n\n2A + 6A -3C +1047 + (4A +2C +14)/3 = -73  \nCombine the first two terms:\n\n8A -3C +1047 + (4A +2C +14)/3 = -73\n\nTo combine these terms, let's multiply all terms by 3 to eliminate denominator:\n\n3*(8A) -3*3C + 3*1047 + 4A +2C +14 = 3*(-73)\n\nCompute:\n\n24A -9C +3141 +4A +2C +14 = -219  \nCombine like terms:\n\n(24A +4A) + (-9C +2C) + (3141 +14) = -219  \n28A -7C + 3155 = -219  \n28A -7C = -219 -3155 = -3374  \nDivide both sides by 7:\n\n4A - C = -482 → equation 10.\n\nSo equation 10: 4A - C = -482 → C = 4A +482.\n\nNow, from equation 9, C = (23A +2449)/2. And from equation 10, C = 4A +482. Therefore:\n\n4A +482 = (23A +2449)/2  \nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n8A +964 = 23A +2449  \nRearranged:\n\n8A -23A = 2449 -964  \n-15A = 1485  \n→ A = 1485 / (-15) = -99.\n\nSo A = -99. Now, substitute back into equation 10 to find C:\n\nC = 4*(-99) +482 = -396 +482 = 86.\n\nSo C = 86.\n\nNow, using equation 9 to check:\n\nC = (23*(-99) +2449)/2  \nCalculate numerator: 23*(-99) = -2277. Then -2277 +2449 = 172. 172/2 = 86. Correct. So that's consistent.\n\nNow, with A = -99, C =86, let's find other variables.\n\nFrom equation 7a: D = 2A - C + 349  \nPlug in A=-99, C=86:\n\nD = 2*(-99) -86 +349 = -198 -86 +349 = (-284) + 349 = 65. So D=65.\n\nNow, from equation 8: E = (2A + C +7)/3  \nPlug in A=-99, C=86:\n\nE = [2*(-99) +86 +7]/3 = (-198 +93)/3 = (-105)/3 = -35. So E = -35.\n\nNow, check equation 5: 2A +3D +2E = ?\n\n2*(-99) +3*65 +2*(-35) = -198 +195 -70 = (-198 +195) is -3, minus 70 is -73. Which matches equation 5's value. Good.\n\nNow, check equation 2: A + 2C +3D +E = ?\n\n-99 + 2*86 +3*65 + (-35)  \n-99 + 172 + 195 -35  \nCalculate step by step:\n\n-99 +172 = 73  \n73 +195 = 268  \n268 -35 = 233. Correct. So equation 2 is satisfied.\n\nEquation 3: 3A + C + 2D + E = ?\n\n3*(-99) +86 +2*65 + (-35)  \n-297 +86 +130 -35  \n-297 +86 is -211, +130 is -81, -35 → -116. Correct. So equation 3 is satisfied.\n\nNow, moving on to equation 1: 3A + B +3C =5. We can find B.\n\nEquation 1: 3*(-99) + B +3*(86) = 5  \n-297 + B +258 = 5  \n(-297 +258) + B = 5  \n-39 + B =5 → B=44.\n\nSo B=44.\n\nNow check equation 4: 3E +A +2C +B = ?\n\n3*(-35) + (-99) +2*86 +44  \n-105 -99 +172 +44  \n-204 + 216 = 12. Correct. So equation 4 is satisfied.\n\nNow equation 6: A +2B +C +2D +E = ?\n\nA=-99, B=44, C=86, D=65, E=-35.\n\nSo: -99 +2*44 +86 +2*65 + (-35)  \nCalculate step by step:\n\n-99 +88 = -11  \n-11 +86 =75  \n75 +130 =205  \n205 -35 =170. Correct. So equation 6 is satisfied. Great, all equations are satisfied.\n\nSo now we have the values for each symbol:\n\nA ($) = -99  \nB (@) = 44  \nC (⊗) = 86  \nD (?) = 65  \nE (⊙) = -35  \n\nNow, the next step is to compute the sum of each column. The grid has 7 columns (since each row has 7 symbols). Let's list each column's symbols and compute their sum.\n\nLet me reconstruct the grid row by row, with their symbols:\n\nRow 1: $ @ ⊗ $ ⊗ $ ⊗  \nRow 2: ⊗ ? $ ? ⊗ ? ⊙  \nRow 3: ⊙ $ $ ⊗ ? ? $  \nRow 4: ⊙ $ ⊙ ⊗ ⊗ @ ⊙  \nRow 5: ⊙ ? ⊙ ? $ $ ?  \nRow 6: $ ? @ ⊙ ? ⊗ @  \n\nNow, for each column (columns 0 to 6?), let's list the symbols in each column:\n\nColumn 1 (first column of each row):\n\nRow 1: $  \nRow 2: ⊗  \nRow 3: ⊙  \nRow 4: ⊙  \nRow 5: ⊙  \nRow 6: $  \n\nSo column 1 symbols: $, ⊗, ⊙, ⊙, ⊙, $ → their values: A, C, E, E, E, A.\n\nSum for column 1: A + C + E + E + E + A = 2A + C + 3E.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n2*(-99) +86 +3*(-35) = -198 +86 -105 = (-198 -105) +86 = -303 +86 = -217.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow1: @  \nRow2: ?  \nRow3: $  \nRow4: $  \nRow5: ?  \nRow6: ?  \n\nSymbols: B, D, A, A, D, D → sum: B + D + A + A + D + D = 2A + 3D + B.\n\nCompute: 2*(-99) +3*65 +44 = -198 +195 +44 = (-198 +195) is -3 +44 = 41.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow1: ⊗  \nRow2: $  \nRow3: $  \nRow4: ⊙  \nRow5: ⊙  \nRow6: @  \n\nSymbols: C, A, A, E, E, B → sum: C + 2A + 2E + B.\n\nValues: 86 + 2*(-99) + 2*(-35) +44.\n\nCalculate: 86 -198 -70 +44 = (86 +44) - (198 +70) = 130 - 268 = -138.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nRow1: $  \nRow2: ?  \nRow3: ⊗  \nRow4: ⊗  \nRow5: ?  \nRow6: ⊙  \n\nSymbols: A, D, C, C, D, E → sum: A + D + 2C + D + E = A + 2D + 2C + E.\n\nCompute: (-99) + 2*65 + 2*86 + (-35)  \n= -99 +130 +172 -35  \n= (-99 -35) + (130 +172) = -134 + 302 = 168.\n\nColumn 5:\n\nRow1: ⊗  \nRow2: ⊗  \nRow3: ?  \nRow4: ⊗  \nRow5: $  \nRow6: ?  \n\nSymbols: C, C, D, C, A, D → sum: 3C + 2D + A.\n\nCompute: 3*86 + 2*65 + (-99) = 258 +130 -99 = 388 -99 = 289.\n\nColumn 6:\n\nRow1: $  \nRow2: ?  \nRow3: ?  \nRow4: @  \nRow5: $  \nRow6: ⊗  \n\nSymbols: A, D, D, B, A, C → sum: 2A + 2D + B + C.\n\nCompute: 2*(-99) + 2*65 +44 +86 = -198 +130 +44 +86 = (-198 +130) is -68 + (44+86)=130 → -68 +130 = 62.\n\nColumn 7:\n\nRow1: ⊗  \nRow2: ⊙  \nRow3: $  \nRow4: ⊙  \nRow5: ?  \nRow6: @  \n\nSymbols: C, E, A, E, D, B → sum: C + 2E + A + D + B.\n\nCompute: 86 + 2*(-35) + (-99) +65 +44  \n= 86 -70 -99 +65 +44  \n= (86 -70) is 16; 16 -99 is -83; -83 +65 is -18; -18 +44 = 26.\n\nSo the column sums are:\n\nColumn 1: -217  \nColumn 2: 41  \nColumn 3: -138  \nColumn 4: 168  \nColumn 5: 289  \nColumn 6: 62  \nColumn 7: 26  \n\nLet me verify these calculations again to make sure I didn't make any errors.\n\nFor column 1:\n\n2A + C + 3E = 2*(-99) +86 +3*(-35) → -198 +86 = -112; 3*(-35) is -105 → -112 -105 = -217. Correct.\n\nColumn 2: 2A +3D +B → 2*(-99)= -198, 3*65=195, +44 → -198 +195 is -3 +44=41. Correct.\n\nColumn 3: C +2A +2E +B → 86 + 2*(-99) + 2*(-35) +44 → 86 -198 -70 +44 = (86+44) - (198+70) = 130 -268 = -138. Correct.\n\nColumn 4: A +2D +2C +E → -99 + 2*65 is 130, 2*86 is 172, and -35.

The columns are 1 through 7 as per the rows. Each row has 7 symbols, so columns 0-6 if zero-indexed, but the problem says \"sum of the elements in each column\", so the order is first column, second, etc.\n\nYes, the list is as computed. So the final answer is the list of these seven numbers.\n ;Answer: [-217, 41, -138, 168, 289, 62, 26]"

      "Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have a grid with symbols and each row's sum is given. We need to find the column sums. Hmm. First, I need to understand the symbols and their corresponding numerical values. Wait, the problem says each symbol represents a numerical value, but I don't know what those values are yet. Oh right, but maybe each symbol has a fixed value that's consistent across the grid. So, for example, if '♦' is always 5, then every occurrence of '♦' in the grid is 5. But how do I find out what each symbol's value is?\n\nWait, the rows have their sums provided. So maybe we can use the rows to set up equations and solve for the symbols. Let me think. Each row's symbols correspond to a certain sum. For example, the first row is \"♦∫-∫∫\" and the sum is 153. Let me break that down. Each position in the row has a symbol, and the sum of those symbols' values is the given row sum. But there are multiple symbols, so maybe there are multiple variables here. But how many symbols are there? Let me check the grid again.\n\nLooking at the grid:\n\nRow 1: ♦∫-∫∫ → symbols are ♦, ∫, -, ∫, ∫\nRow 2: @---∫ → @, -, -, -, ∫\nRow 3: -♦-♦@ → -, ♦, -, ♦, @\nRow 4: -♦∫♦- → -, ♦, ∫, ♦, -\nRow 5: ∫♦@-- → ∫, ♦, @, -, -\nRow 6: ♦♦-∫♦ → ♦, ♦, -, ∫, ♦\nRow 7: -∫@♦- → -, ∫, @, ♦, -\n\nSo the symbols used are: ♦, ∫, -, @. Wait, but the hyphen \"-\" might be a symbol here. So there are four symbols: ♦, ∫, -, and @. Each of these has a numerical value. So we need to find the values of these four symbols.\n\nLet me denote them as variables:\n\nLet’s assign variables:\n\nLet D = value of ♦\n\nI = value of ∫\n\nH = value of - (hyphen)\n\nA = value of @\n\nNow, each row gives an equation based on the symbols in that row. Let's write equations for each row.\n\nRow 1: ♦ + ∫ + - + ∫ + ∫ = 153 → D + I + H + I + I = D + 3I + H = 153 → Equation 1: D + 3I + H = 153\n\nRow 2: @ + - + - + - + ∫ = A + H + H + H + I = A + 3H + I = -205 → Equation 2: A + 3H + I = -205\n\nRow 3: - + ♦ + - + ♦ + @ = H + D + H + D + A = 2D + 2H + A = -154 → Equation 3: 2D + 2H + A = -154\n\nRow 4: - + ♦ + ∫ + ♦ + - = H + D + I + D + H = 2D + I + 2H = 6 → Equation 4: 2D + I + 2H = 6\n\nRow 5: ∫ + ♦ + @ + - + - = I + D + A + H + H = D + I + A + 2H = -122 → Equation 5: D + I + A + 2H = -122\n\nRow 6: ♦ + ♦ + - + ∫ + ♦ = D + D + H + I + D = 3D + H + I = 89 → Equation 6: 3D + H + I = 89\n\nRow 7: - + ∫ + @ + ♦ + - = H + I + A + D + H = D + A + I + 2H = -122 → Equation 7: D + A + I + 2H = -122\n\nHmm. Now we have seven equations with four variables. Let me check if some equations are duplicates. For example, equation 5 and equation 7 look similar. Let me check:\n\nEquation 5: D + I + A + 2H = -122\n\nEquation 7: D + A + I + 2H = -122 → same as equation 5. So equations 5 and 7 are the same. So we can ignore one of them.\n\nSo, equations 1 to 6, but equations 5 and 7 are same. So total of 6 equations. Let me list them again:\n\nEquation 1: D + 3I + H = 153\n\nEquation 2: A + 3H + I = -205\n\nEquation 3: 2D + 2H + A = -154\n\nEquation 4: 2D + I + 2H = 6\n\nEquation 5: D + I + A + 2H = -122\n\nEquation 6: 3D + H + I = 89\n\nSo four variables (D, I, H, A) and six equations. Let's try solving these equations.\n\nFirst, perhaps we can find relations between equations.\n\nLet me see equations 1 and 6. Equation 1 is D + 3I + H = 153, equation 6 is 3D + H + I = 89. Let me try to subtract or combine them.\n\nLet me write them:\n\nEquation 1: D + 3I + H = 153\n\nEquation 6: 3D + I + H = 89\n\nLet me subtract equation 6 from equation 1:\n\n(D - 3D) + (3I - I) + (H - H) = 153 - 89 → -2D + 2I = 64 → divide by 2: -D + I = 32 → I = D + 32. Let's call this equation 8: I = D + 32.\n\nNow, equation 6: 3D + H + I = 89. Substitute I from equation 8:\n\n3D + H + (D +32) = 89 → 4D + H + 32 = 89 → 4D + H = 57 → H = 57 -4D. Let's call this equation 9.\n\nNow, equation 4: 2D + I + 2H = 6. Substitute I and H from equations 8 and 9.\n\nI = D +32, H = 57-4D.\n\nSo 2D + (D +32) + 2*(57 -4D) = 6.\n\nCalculate:\n\n2D + D +32 + 114 -8D = 6 → (2D + D -8D) + (32 +114) = 6 → (-5D) + 146 = 6 → -5D = 6 -146 = -140 → D = (-140)/(-5) = 28.\n\nSo D = 28. Then from equation 8, I = 28 +32 = 60. From equation 9, H = 57 -4*28 = 57 -112 = -55.\n\nSo now we have D=28, I=60, H=-55.\n\nNow we can find A using equation 2: A + 3H + I = -205.\n\nSubstitute H=-55, I=60:\n\nA + 3*(-55) + 60 = A -165 +60 = A -105 = -205 → A = -205 +105 = -100.\n\nSo A = -100.\n\nLet me check if these values satisfy other equations. Let's check equation 3: 2D + 2H + A = ?\n\n2*28 =56, 2*(-55) = -110. So 56 -110 + (-100) = 56 -110 -100 = 56 -210 = -154. Which matches equation 3's value of -154. Good.\n\nEquation 5: D + I + A + 2H = 28 +60 + (-100) + 2*(-55) = 88 -100 -110 = (88-100) = -12 -110 = -122. Which matches equation 5. Good.\n\nEquation 1: D +3I + H = 28 + 3*60 + (-55) = 28 +180 -55 = 208 -55 = 153. Correct.\n\nEquation 4: 2D + I + 2H = 2*28 +60 +2*(-55) = 56 +60 -110 = 116 -110 = 6. Correct.\n\nEquation 6: 3D + H + I = 3*28 + (-55) +60 = 84 +5 = 89. Correct.\n\nSo all equations are satisfied. Great! Now, we have the values:\n\n♦ (D) = 28\n\n∫ (I) = 60\n\n- (H) = -55\n\n@ (A) = -100\n\nNow, we need to compute the column sums. The grid has 5 columns (since each row has 5 symbols). Let me check each row's length. For example, first row is 5 symbols. So there are 5 columns. Let me list each column's symbols and compute their sum.\n\nFirst, let's list each column. Let me write the grid again with the symbols:\n\nRow 1: ♦ ∫ - ∫ ∫\n\nRow 2: @ - - - ∫\n\nRow 3: - ♦ - ♦ @\n\nRow 4: - ♦ ∫ ♦ -\n\nRow 5: ∫ ♦ @ - -\n\nRow 6: ♦ ♦ - ∫ ♦\n\nRow 7: - ∫ @ ♦ -\n\nNow, columns are:\n\nColumn 1: Row1: ♦, Row2: @, Row3: -, Row4: -, Row5: ∫, Row6: ♦, Row7: -.\n\nColumn 2: Row1: ∫, Row2: -, Row3: ♦, Row4: ♦, Row5: ♦, Row6: ♦, Row7: ∫.\n\nColumn 3: Row1: -, Row2: -, Row3: -, Row4: ∫, Row5: @, Row6: -, Row7: @.\n\nColumn 4: Row1: ∫, Row2: -, Row3: ♦, Row4: ♦, Row5: -, Row6: ∫, Row7: ♦.\n\nColumn 5: Row1: ∫, Row2: ∫, Row3: @, Row4: -, Row5: -, Row6: ♦, Row7: -.\n\nSo each column has 7 elements. Let me compute each column's sum by substituting the symbols with their values.\n\nLet me compute each column one by one.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow1: D (28)\n\nRow2: A (-100)\n\nRow3: H (-55)\n\nRow4: H (-55)\n\nRow5: I (60)\n\nRow6: D (28)\n\nRow7: H (-55)\n\nSum: 28 + (-100) + (-55) + (-55) + 60 + 28 + (-55)\n\nLet me calculate step by step:\n\nStart with 28.\n\n28 -100 = -72\n\n-72 -55 = -127\n\n-127 -55 = -182\n\n-182 +60 = -122\n\n-122 +28 = -94\n\n-94 -55 = -149.

      "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the sum of each column in this grid based on the row sums provided. Each symbol represents a numerical value. The grid has rows with different symbols and their corresponding row sums. My task is to calculate the column sums once I determine the value of each symbol.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the unique symbols in the grid. Let me list them out. From the given rows:\n\nLooking at each row's symbols:\n\nRow 1: @, ∑, @, @, @ → symbols are @ and ∑\nRow 2: ♠, ♠, @, ♠, ∑ → symbols are ♠, @, ∑\nRow 3: ♠, ∑, ∏, @, ♠ → symbols are ♠, ∑, ∏, @\nRow 4: ∑, ∏, ∏, ♠, ♠ → ∑, ∏, ♠\nRow 5: ∏, @, @, ∑, @ → ∏, @, ∑\nRow 6: ∏, ∏, ∏, @, ∑ → same as above\nRow 7: @, ∑, @, ∏, ∏ → same\nRow 8: ♠, @, @, ♠, ∏ → ♠, @, ∏\nRow 9: @, ♠, @, ∑, ∏ → @, ♠, ∑, ∏\nRow 10: ∑, ∏, ♠, ∏, ∏ → ∑, ∏, ♠\n\nSo the unique symbols are @, ∑, ♠, ∏.

Let me assign:\n\nLet’s say:\nA = @\nB = ∑\nC = ♠\nD = ∏\n\nNow, each row's symbols can be converted into equations based on their counts and the given row sum.\n\nLet me go through each row and create equations.\n\nRow 1: @∑@@@ sum is -246. The symbols are A, B, A, A, A → total of 4A + 1B = -246 → 4A + B = -246. (Equation 1)\n\nRow 2: ♠♠@♠∑ → symbols are C, C, A, C, B → 3C + 1A + 1B = -312. (Equation 2)\n\nRow 3: ♠∑∏@♠ → C, B, D, A, C → 2C + 1B + 1D + 1A = -159. (Equation 3)\n\nRow 4: ∑∏∏♠♠ → B, D, D, C, C → 1B + 2D + 2C = -28. (Equation 4)\n\nRow 5: ∏@@∑@ → D, A, A, B, A → 3A + 1B + 1D = -115. (Equation 5)\n\nRow 6: ∏∏∏@∑ → D, D, D, A, B → 3D + 1A + 1B = 147. (Equation 6)\n\nRow 7: @∑@∏∏ → A, B, A, D, D → 2A + 1B + 2D = 16. (Equation 7)\n\nRow 8: ♠@@♠∏ → C, A, A, C, D → 2C + 2A + 1D = -128. (Equation 8)\n\nRow 9: @♠@∑∏ → A, C, A, B, D → 2A + 1C + 1B + 1D = -137. (Equation 9)\n\nRow 10: ∑∏♠∏∏ → B, D, C, D, D → 1B + 3D + 1C = 125. (Equation 10)\n\nNow, I have 10 equations with four variables. But since there are only four variables, maybe some equations are redundant. Let me try solving these equations step by step.\n\nStarting with Equation 1: 4A + B = -246 → B = -246 -4A. Let's keep this in mind.\n\nEquation 5: 3A + B + D = -115. Substitute B from Equation 1 into this. So:\n\n3A + (-246 -4A) + D = -115 → 3A -246 -4A + D = -115 → -A + D = -115 +246 → -A + D = 131 → D = A + 131. (Equation 5a)\n\nEquation 7: 2A + B + 2D = 16. Again, substitute B from Equation 1 and D from Equation 5a.\n\nSo:\n\n2A + (-246 -4A) + 2*(A + 131) = 16.\n\nLet's compute:\n\n2A -246 -4A + 2A + 262 = 16 → (2A -4A +2A) + (-246 +262) = 16 → 0A +16 =16 → 16=16. Hmm, that's an identity. So this equation doesn't help us find new info. So maybe another equation.\n\nLet me check Equation 6: 3D + A + B = 147. Substitute B and D:\n\nD = A +131, B = -246 -4A. So:\n\n3*(A +131) + A + (-246 -4A) = 147.\n\nCompute:\n\n3A + 393 + A -246 -4A = 147 → (3A +A -4A) + (393 -246) = 147 → 0A + 147 =147 → 147=147. Again, identity. So equations 5, 6,7 are dependent. Need to use other equations.\n\nLet me look at Equation 2: 3C + A + B = -312. Substitute B from Equation 1:\n\n3C + A + (-246 -4A) = -312 → 3C -3A -246 = -312 → 3C -3A = -312 +246 → 3C -3A = -66 → divide by 3: C -A = -22 → C = A -22. (Equation 2a)\n\nNow, Equation 8: 2C + 2A + D = -128. Substitute C from Equation 2a and D from Equation 5a:\n\n2*(A -22) + 2A + (A +131) = -128 → 2A -44 +2A +A +131 = -128 → (2A +2A +A) + (-44 +131) = -128 → 5A +87 = -128 → 5A = -128 -87 → 5A = -215 → A = -43.\n\nGreat! Now that we have A = -43.\n\nNow compute other variables:\n\nFrom Equation 1: B = -246 -4A → B = -246 -4*(-43) = -246 + 172 = -74.\n\nFrom Equation 5a: D = A +131 → D = -43 +131 = 88.\n\nFrom Equation 2a: C = A -22 → C = -43 -22 = -65.\n\nNow check if these values satisfy other equations.\n\nLet me check Equation 3: 2C + B + D + A = -159.\n\nWait, Equation 3 is 2C + B + D + A = ?\n\nWait original equation 3 is symbols 2C + 1B + 1D + 1A = -159.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n2*(-65) + (-74) + 88 + (-43) = ?\n\nCalculate:\n\n-130 -74 +88 -43 = (-130 -74) + (88 -43) = -204 +45 = -159. Correct. Good.\n\nEquation 4: B + 2D + 2C = -28.\n\nB is -74, D is 88, C is -65.\n\n-74 + 2*88 + 2*(-65) = -74 + 176 -130 = (-74 -130) +176 = -204 +176 = -28. Correct.\n\nEquation 5: 3A + B + D = -115. 3*(-43) + (-74) +88 → -129 -74 +88 = -203 +88 = -115. Correct.\n\nEquation 6: 3D + A + B = 3*88 + (-43) + (-74) = 264 -43 -74 = 264 -117 = 147. Correct.\n\nEquation 7: 2A + B + 2D = 2*(-43) + (-74) + 2*88 = -86 -74 +176 = (-160) +176 = 16. Correct.\n\nEquation 8: already used. Equation 9: 2A + C + B + D = ?\n\n2*(-43) + (-65) + (-74) +88 = -86 -65 -74 +88 = (-86 -65 -74) +88 = (-225) +88 = -137. Which matches equation 9's sum of -137. Correct.\n\nEquation 10: B + 3D + C = -74 + 3*88 + (-65) = -74 + 264 -65 = 264 -139 = 125. Correct. All equations are satisfied. Great!\n\nNow, we have the values:\n\nA (@) = -43\n\nB (∑) = -74\n\nC (♠) = -65\n\nD (∏) = 88\n\nNow, the next step is to compute the column sums. Each column in the grid has a certain number of symbols, and we need to sum their values per column.\n\nFirst, I need to know how many symbols are in each column for each row. The grid is given as 10 rows, each with 5 symbols. Let me reconstruct the grid as a 10x5 grid and then count per column.\n\nLet me write down each row's symbols and their positions:\n\nRow 1: @ ∑ @ @ @ → columns 1: @, 2: ∑, 3: @, 4: @, 5: @\n\nRow 2: ♠ ♠ @ ♠ ∑ → columns 1: ♠, 2: ♠, 3: @, 4: ♠, 5: ∑\n\nRow 3: ♠ ∑ ∏ @ ♠ → columns 1: ♠, 2: ∑, 3: ∏, 4: @, 5: ♠\n\nRow 4: ∑ ∏ ∏ ♠ ♠ → columns 1: ∑, 2: ∏, 3: ∏, 4: ♠, 5: ♠\n\nRow 5: ∏ @ @ ∑ @ → columns 1: ∏, 2: @, 3: @, 4: ∑, 5: @\n\nRow 6: ∏ ∏ ∏ @ ∑ → columns 1: ∏, 2: ∏, 3: ∏, 4: @, 5: ∑\n\nRow 7: @ ∑ @ ∏ ∏ → columns 1: @, 2: ∑, 3: @, 4: ∏, 5: ∏\n\nRow 8: ♠ @ @ ♠ ∏ → columns 1: ♠, 2: @, 3: @, 4: ♠, 5: ∏\n\nRow 9: @ ♠ @ ∑ ∏ → columns 1: @, 2: ♠, 3: @, 4: ∑, 5: ∏\n\nRow 10: ∑ ∏ ♠ ∏ ∏ → columns 1: ∑, 2: ∏, 3: ♠, 4: ∏, 5: ∏\n\nNow, for each column (columns 1 to 5), count how many times each symbol appears, then multiply by their respective values and sum.\n\nLet me create a table for each column:\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow 1: @ (-43)\n\nRow 2: ♠ (-65)\n\nRow 3: ♠ (-65)\n\nRow 4: ∑ (-74)\n\nRow 5: ∏ (88)\n\nRow 6: ∏ (88)\n\nRow 7: @ (-43)\n\nRow 8: ♠ (-65)\n\nRow 9: @ (-43)\n\nRow 10: ∑ (-74)\n\nSo column 1 symbols:\n\nCount of @: rows 1,7,9 → 3 times\n\nCount of ♠: rows 2,3,8 → 3 times\n\nCount of ∑: rows 4,10 → 2 times\n\nCount of ∏: rows 5,6 → 2 times\n\nSo column 1 sum is:\n\n3*A + 3*C + 2*B + 2*D\n\nSubstituting:\n\n3*(-43) + 3*(-65) + 2*(-74) + 2*(88)\n\nCalculate:\n\n-129 -195 -148 + 176 = Let's compute step by step:\n\n-129 -195 = -324\n\n-324 -148 = -472\n\n-472 +176 = -296\n\nSo column 1 sum is -296.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow 1: ∑ (-74)\n\nRow 2: ♠ (-65)\n\nRow 3: ∑ (-74)\n\nRow 4: ∏ (88)\n\nRow 5: @ (-43)\n\nRow 6: ∏ (88)\n\nRow 7: ∑ (-74)\n\nRow 8: @ (-43)\n\nRow 9: ♠ (-65)\n\nRow 10: ∏ (88)\n\nSo column 2 symbols:\n\nCount of ∑: rows 1,3,7 → 3 times\n\nCount of ♠: rows 2,9 → 2 times\n\nCount of ∏: rows 4,6,10 → 3 times\n\nCount of @: rows 5,8 → 2 times\n\nSum:\n\n3*B + 2*C + 3*D + 2*A\n\nSubstituting:\n\n3*(-74) + 2*(-65) + 3*(88) + 2*(-43)\n\nCalculate:\n\n-222 -130 + 264 -86\n\nLet's compute step by step:\n\n-222 -130 = -352\n\n-352 +264 = -88\n\n-88 -86 = -174\n\nSo column 2 sum is -174.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow 1: @ (-43)\n\nRow 2: @ (-43)\n\nRow 3: ∏ (88)\n\nRow 4: ∏ (88)\n\nRow 5: @ (-43)\n\nRow 6: ∏ (88)\n\nRow 7: @ (-43)\n\nRow 8: @ (-43)\n\nRow 9: @ (-43)\n\nRow 10: ♠ (-65)\n\nSo column 3 symbols:\n\nCount of @: rows 1,2,5,7,8,9 → 6 times\n\nCount of ∏: rows 3,4,6 → 3 times\n\nCount of ♠: row 10 → 1 time\n\nSum:\n\n6*A + 3*D + 1*C\n\nSubstituting:\n\n6*(-43) + 3*88 + (-65)\n\nCalculate:\n\n-258 + 264 -65 = ( -258 +264 ) = 6 -65 = -59\n\nSo column 3 sum is -59.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nRow 1: @ (-43)\n\nRow 2: ♠ (-65)\n\nRow 3: @ (-43)\n\nRow 4: ♠ (-65)\n\nRow 5: ∑ (-74)\n\nRow 6: @ (-43)\n\nRow 7: ∏ (88)\n\nRow 8: ♠ (-65)\n\nRow 9: ∑ (-74)\n\nRow 10: ∏ (88)\n\nSo column 4 symbols:\n\nCount of @: rows 1,3,6 → 3 times\n\nCount of ♠: rows 2,4,8 → 3 times\n\nCount of ∑: rows 5,9 → 2 times\n\nCount of ∏: rows 7,10 → 2 times\n\nSum:\n\n3*A + 3*C + 2*B + 2*D\n\nSame as column 1? Let me check:\n\n3*(-43) + 3*(-65) + 2*(-74) + 2*(88)\n\nWhich is same as column 1's calculation. So 3A +3C +2B +2D = -296? Wait, but column 1 sum was -296. Wait, but column 4 here has same counts? Let me verify:\n\nYes, column 4 has 3A, 3C, 2B, 2D. Same as column 1. So sum is -296. Wait, but let me recalculate to confirm:\n\n3*(-43) is -129, 3*(-65) is -195. Sum so far: -324. 2*(-74) is -148. Total now -472. 2*88 is 176. Total: -472 +176 = -296. Correct.

So total: -258 +264 -65 = 6 -65 = -59. Correct.\n\nColumn 5: 2A + 2B + 2C +4D → 2*(-43) = -86, 2*(-74) = -148, 2*(-65) = -130, 4*88=352. Sum: -86-148= -234, -234-130=-364, +352= -12.

Correct.\n\nSo the final column sums are:\n\n[-296, -174, -59, -296, -12]\n\nTherefore, the answer should be this list.\n ;Answer: [-296, -174, -59, -296, -12]"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the column sums based on the given grid and row sums. The grid has symbols, each representing a numerical value. The rows have their sums provided, and I need to compute the column sums. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure. The grid has 8 rows and, looking at the first row, let's count the symbols. The first row is \"*⊕*#∏*#*# -30\". Let's count the symbols before the sum. Let's see: *, ⊕, *, #, ∏, *, #, *, #. That's 8 symbols. So each row has 8 symbols, and there are 8 rows. Therefore, the grid is 8x8. Each column will then have 8 elements, and I need to find the sum for each of the 8 columns.\n\nBut how do I find the numerical values of the symbols? Since each row's sum is given, maybe there's a pattern or a way to deduce the values. Wait, but without knowing the individual symbol values, how can I compute the column sums? Unless there's a trick here. Maybe the symbols correspond to standard symbols with known values? Or perhaps it's a math puzzle where each symbol is a variable, and we need to solve equations based on the row sums?\n\nBut with 8 symbols and 8 rows, maybe we can set up a system of equations. Let me think. Let's assign variables to each unique symbol. Let's list all the symbols present in the grid. Let's go through each row:\n\nRow 1: *, ⊕, *, #, ∏, *, #, *, #. So symbols are *, ⊕, #, ∏.\n\nRow 2: ∏, ∏, ∏, ⊕, ⊕, ∏, ∥, ≥, ∥. Wait, but each row should have 8 symbols. Wait the first row's symbols are 8, so maybe the input here is a typo? Let me check again. The user provided:\n\nGrid:\n*⊕*#∏*#*# -30\n∏∏∏⊕⊕∏∥≥∥ 155\n⊕≥*#≥*⊕%∏ 244\n*∏*≥#⊕≥%∏ 234\n#%%≥⊕∏*⊕# 120\n⊕#≥#∏⊕∏#* -50\n≥⊕∥⊕⊕≥∥∏≥ 243\n∏%⊕⊕∏∥⊕∥⊕ 172\n\nWait, each line after the grid is a row. Let me count the symbols in each row:\n\nFirst row: * ⊕ * # ∏ * # * # → that's 8 symbols? Let's count:\n\n1. *, 2. ⊕, 3. *, 4. #, 5. ∏, 6. *, 7. #, 8. *, 9. #? Wait that's 9 symbols. Wait the user wrote \"*⊕*#∏*#*# -30\". Let me count the symbols before the sum. Let's split the first line:\n\nSymbols: *, ⊕, *, #, ∏, *, #, *, #. That's 9 symbols? Wait:\n\n1. *, 2. ⊕, 3. *, 4. #, 5. ∏, 6. *, 7. #, 8. *, 9. #. Oh no, that's 9 symbols. But the sum is -30. Then the next row is \"∏∏∏⊕⊕∏∥≥∥ 155\". Let's count symbols here: ∏, ∏, ∏, ⊕, ⊕, ∏, ∥, ≥, ∥ → 9 symbols. So each row has 9 symbols? Then there are 9 columns? Wait but the problem statement says \"compute the sum of the elements in each column\". So maybe the grid is 8 rows by 9 columns? Because each row has 9 symbols. Let me check again.\n\nFirst row: *⊕*#∏*#*# → Let's split into individual symbols. Let me write them:\n\nSymbol positions:\n\n1. *\n2. ⊕\n3. *\n4. #\n5. ∏\n6. *\n7. #\n8. *\n9. #\n\nYes, 9 symbols. So each row has 9 symbols. So the grid is 8 rows by 9 columns. Therefore, there are 9 columns to sum. The problem says to output the column sums as a list. So the answer should be a list of 9 numbers.\n\nBut how to find the column sums if we don't know the value of each symbol? The row sums are given. So each row's sum is the sum of its 9 symbols. So if I can find the value of each symbol, then I can compute the column sums. But there are multiple symbols here. Let me list all unique symbols in the grid.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nFirst row: *, ⊕, #, ∏.\n\nSecond row: ∏, ⊕, ∥, ≥.\n\nThird row: ⊕, ≥, *, #, ∏, %.\n\nFourth row: *, ∏, ≥, #, ⊕, %.\n\nFifth row: #, %, ≥, ⊕, ∏, *.\n\nSixth row: ⊕, #, ≥, ∏, *.\n\nSeventh row: ≥, ⊕, ∥, ∏, ≥.\n\nEighth row: ∏, %, ⊕, ∥.\n\nSo symbols are: *, ⊕, #, ∏, ∥, ≥, %, and maybe others? Let me check each row:\n\nRow 1: *, ⊕, #, ∏.\n\nRow 2: ∏, ∥, ⊕, ≥.\n\nRow 3: ⊕, ≥, *, #, ∏, %.\n\nRow 4: *, ∏, ≥, #, ⊕, %.\n\nRow 5: #, %, ≥, ⊕, ∏, *.\n\nRow 6: ⊕, #, ≥, ∏, *, ?\n\nWait row 6: \"⊕#≥#∏⊕∏#* -50\". Let's parse symbols:\n\n⊕, #, ≥, #, ∏, ⊕, ∏, #, * → symbols are ⊕, #, ≥, ∏, *.\n\nRow 7: \"≥⊕∥⊕⊕≥∥∏≥ 243\". Symbols: ≥, ⊕, ∥, ⊕, ⊕, ≥, ∥, ∏, ≥ → symbols ≥, ⊕, ∥, ∏.\n\nRow 8: \"∏%⊕⊕∏∥⊕∥⊕ 172\". Symbols: ∏, %, ⊕, ⊕, ∏, ∥, ⊕, ∥, ⊕ → ∏, %, ⊕, ∥.\n\nSo all symbols are: *, ⊕, #, ∏, ∥, ≥, %.\n\nTotal of 7 unique symbols. Let me count:\n\n1. *\n2. ⊕\n3. #\n4. ∏\n5. ∥\n6. ≥\n7. %\n\nSo 7 symbols. But there are 8 rows with their sums. So perhaps we can set up equations for each row, with variables for each symbol, and solve the system. Let me assign variables:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet a = *, b = ⊕, c = #, d = ∏, e = ∥, f = ≥, g = %.\n\nEach row's sum is the sum of its symbols. For example, the first row is:\n\nRow 1: *, ⊕, *, #, ∏, *, #, *, # → symbols: a, b, a, c, d, a, c, a, c. So sum is:\n\na + b + a + c + d + a + c + a + c = 4a + b + 3c + d = -30.\n\nSimilarly, each row gives an equation. So with 8 equations and 7 variables. Wait, but 8 equations for 7 variables may be overdetermined. Let's check if they are consistent.\n\nLet me write all equations:\n\nRow 1: 4a + b + 3c + d = -30. (Equation 1)\n\nRow 2: \"∏∏∏⊕⊕∏∥≥∥ 155\" → symbols: d, d, d, b, b, d, e, f, e. Sum:\n\n3d + 2b + d + e + f + e = 4d + 2b + 2e + f = 155. (Equation 2)\n\nRow 3: \"⊕≥*#≥*⊕%∏ 244\" → symbols: b, f, a, c, f, a, b, g, d. Sum:\n\nb + f + a + c + f + a + b + g + d = 2a + 2b + c + 2f + d + g = 244. (Equation 3)\n\nRow 4: \"*∏*≥#⊕≥%∏ 234\" → symbols: a, d, a, f, c, b, f, g, d. Sum:\n\na + d + a + f + c + b + f + g + d = 2a + b + c + 2d + 2f + g = 234. (Equation 4)\n\nRow 5: \"#%%≥⊕∏*⊕# 120\" → symbols: c, g, g, f, b, d, a, b, c. Sum:\n\nc + 2g + f + b + d + a + b + c = a + 2b + 2c + d + f + 2g = 120. (Equation 5)\n\nRow 6: \"⊕#≥#∏⊕∏#* -50\" → symbols: b, c, f, c, d, b, d, c, a. Sum:\n\nb + c + f + c + d + b + d + c + a = a + 2b + 3c + 2d + f = -50. (Equation 6)\n\nRow 7: \"≥⊕∥⊕⊕≥∥∏≥ 243\" → symbols: f, b, e, b, b, f, e, d, f. Sum:\n\nf + b + e + b + b + f + e + d + f = 3b + d + 2e + 3f = 243. (Equation 7)\n\nRow 8: \"∏%⊕⊕∏∥⊕∥⊕ 172\" → symbols: d, g, b, b, d, e, b, e, b. Sum:\n\nd + g + 2b + d + e + 3b + e = 2d + g + 5b + 2e = 172. (Equation 8)\n\nNow we have 8 equations with 7 variables. Let me check if they are consistent.\n\nLet me list all equations again:\n\nEquation 1: 4a + b + 3c + d = -30.\n\nEquation 2: 4d + 2b + 2e + f = 155.\n\nEquation 3: 2a + 2b + c + 2f + d + g = 244.\n\nEquation 4: 2a + b + c + 2d + 2f + g = 234.\n\nEquation 5: a + 2b + 2c + d + f + 2g = 120.\n\nEquation 6: a + 2b + 3c + 2d + f = -50.\n\nEquation 7: 3b + d + 2e + 3f = 243.\n\nEquation 8: 5b + 2d + 2e + g = 172.\n\nHmm, this is a system of equations. Let's try to solve them step by step.\n\nFirst, maybe we can find relations between equations. Let's look for equations that can be subtracted or combined.\n\nLooking at Equations 3 and 4:\n\nEquation 3: 2a + 2b + c + 2f + d + g = 244.\n\nEquation 4: 2a + b + c + 2d + 2f + g = 234.\n\nSubtract Equation 4 from Equation 3:\n\n(2a - 2a) + (2b - b) + (c - c) + (2f - 2f) + (d - 2d) + (g - g) = 244 - 234.\n\nWhich simplifies to: b - d = 10 → b = d + 10. (Equation A)\n\nThat's helpful. Let's note that.\n\nNow, Equation 5: a + 2b + 2c + d + f + 2g = 120.\n\nEquation 6: a + 2b + 3c + 2d + f = -50.\n\nSubtract Equation 6 from Equation 5:\n\n(a - a) + (2b - 2b) + (2c - 3c) + (d - 2d) + (f - f) + 2g - 0 = 120 - (-50).\n\nWhich gives: -c -d + 2g = 170 → 2g = c + d + 170 → g = (c + d + 170)/2. (Equation B)\n\nNow, Equations 3 and 4 also involve g. Let's see if we can use Equation A and B to eliminate variables.\n\nLet me also look at Equation 1: 4a + b + 3c + d = -30. Since we know b = d + 10, substitute into Equation 1:\n\n4a + (d + 10) + 3c + d = -30 → 4a + 2d + 3c + 10 = -30 → 4a + 2d + 3c = -40. (Equation 1a)\n\nNow, let's look at Equations 3 and 4 again.\n\nEquation 3: 2a + 2b + c + 2f + d + g = 244. Substitute b = d +10:\n\n2a + 2(d+10) + c + 2f + d + g = 244 → 2a + 2d + 20 + c + 2f + d + g = 244 → 2a + 3d + c + 2f + g = 224. (Equation 3a)\n\nEquation 4: 2a + b + c + 2d + 2f + g = 234. Substitute b = d +10:\n\n2a + (d +10) + c + 2d + 2f + g = 234 → 2a + 3d +10 + c + 2f + g = 234 → 2a +3d +c + 2f +g = 224. Which is same as Equation 3a. So Equations 3 and 4 are the same after substitution. So no new info there.\n\nNow, let's look at Equations 5 and 6 again. We have Equation B: g = (c + d + 170)/2. Let's substitute this into Equations 3a and others.\n\nEquation 3a: 2a +3d +c + 2f +g = 224. Substitute g:\n\n2a +3d +c + 2f + (c + d + 170)/2 = 224.\n\nMultiply all terms by 2 to eliminate denominator:\n\n4a +6d +2c +4f +c +d +170 = 448 → 4a +7d +3c +4f = 448 -170 = 278. (Equation 3b)\n\nNow, Equation 1a: 4a + 2d + 3c = -40. Let me write that again:\n\nEquation 1a: 4a = -40 -2d -3c → a = (-40 -2d -3c)/4. (Equation 1b)\n\nLet me substitute a into Equation 3b.\n\nEquation 3b: 4a +7d +3c +4f = 278.\n\nSubstitute 4a from Equation 1a:\n\n(-40 -2d -3c) +7d +3c +4f = 278 → -40 -2d -3c +7d +3c +4f = 278 → (-40) +5d +4f = 278 → 5d +4f = 318. (Equation C)\n\nNow, let's look at Equation 2: 4d + 2b + 2e + f = 155. Since b = d +10, substitute:\n\n4d + 2(d+10) + 2e + f = 155 → 4d + 2d +20 + 2e +f = 155 → 6d + 2e +f = 135. (Equation 2a)\n\nEquation 7: 3b + d + 2e +3f = 243. Substitute b = d +10:\n\n3(d +10) +d +2e +3f = 243 → 3d +30 +d +2e +3f = 243 → 4d +2e +3f = 213. (Equation 7a)\n\nNow, Equations 2a and 7a involve 6d +2e +f and 4d +2e +3f. Let me write them:\n\nEquation 2a: 6d +2e +f = 135.\n\nEquation 7a: 4d +2e +3f = 213.\n\nLet me subtract Equation 2a from Equation 7a:\n\n(4d -6d) + (2e -2e) + (3f -f) = 213 -135 → -2d +2f =78 → -d +f =39 → f = d +39. (Equation D)\n\nNow, substitute f = d +39 into Equation C (5d +4f = 318):\n\n5d +4*(d +39) = 318 → 5d +4d +156 =318 → 9d = 162 → d = 18.\n\nSo d = 18. Then from Equation A: b = d +10 → b = 28.\n\nFrom Equation D: f = d +39 → f = 18 +39 = 57.\n\nNow, let's find other variables.\n\nFrom Equation 1a: 4a +2d +3c = -40. Since d=18:\n\n4a + 2*18 +3c = -40 → 4a +36 +3c = -40 → 4a +3c = -76 → 4a = -76 -3c → a = (-76 -3c)/4. (Equation 1c)\n\nNow, let's look at Equation 6: a + 2b +3c +2d +f = -50. Substitute known values:\n\na + 2*28 +3c +2*18 +57 = -50 → a +56 +3c +36 +57 = -50 → a +3c +149 = -50 → a +3c = -199. (Equation 6a)\n\nFrom Equation 1c: a = (-76 -3c)/4. Substitute into Equation 6a:\n\n(-76 -3c)/4 +3c = -199 → Multiply all terms by 4:\n\n-76 -3c +12c = -796 → 9c -76 = -796 → 9c = -720 → c = -80.\n\nNow, c = -80. Then from Equation 1c: a = (-76 -3*(-80))/4 → (-76 +240)/4 → 164/4 = 41. So a = 41.\n\nNow, we have:\n\na = 41 (value of *)\n\nb = 28 (⊕)\n\nc = -80 (#)\n\nd = 18 (∏)\n\nf = 57 (≥)\n\nNow, let's find e (∥) and g (%).\n\nFrom Equation 2a: 6d +2e +f =135. Substitute d=18, f=57:\n\n6*18 +2e +57 = 135 → 108 +57 +2e = 135 → 165 +2e =135 → 2e = -30 → e = -15.\n\nSo e = -15.\n\nNow, from Equation B: g = (c +d +170)/2 → substitute c=-80, d=18:\n\ng = (-80 +18 +170)/2 = (108)/2 = 54. So g=54.\n\nNow, check if these values satisfy other equations.\n\nLet's check Equation 3a: 2a +3d +c +2f +g = 224.\n\nSubstitute:\n\n2*41 +3*18 + (-80) +2*57 +54 = 82 +54 -80 +114 +54 = 82+54=136; 136-80=56; 56+114=170; 170+54=224. Correct.\n\nEquation 5: a +2b +2c +d +f +2g = 120.\n\nSubstitute:\n\n41 +2*28 +2*(-80) +18 +57 +2*54 = 41 +56 -160 +18 +57 +108.\n\nCalculate step by step:\n\n41+56=97; 97-160=-63; -63+18=-45; -45+57=12; 12+108=120. Correct.\n\nEquation 7a: 4d +2e +3f = 213 → 4*18 +2*(-15) +3*57 = 72 -30 +171 = 72+141=213. Correct.\n\nEquation 8: 5b +2d +2e +g = 172. Substitute:\n\n5*28 + 2*18 + 2*(-15) +54 = 140 +36 -30 +54 = 140+36=176; 176-30=146; 146+54=200. Wait, but expected 172. Wait, this is a problem. Did I make a mistake here?\n\nWait Equation 8 is: 5b + 2d + 2e + g = 172?\n\nWait Equation 8 was derived from the 8th row's symbols. Let me recheck the equation for row 8.\n\nRow 8: \"∏%⊕⊕∏∥⊕∥⊕ 172\" → symbols: d, g, b, b, d, e, b, e, b. Sum:\n\nd + g + b + b + d + e + b + e + b = d + g + 4b + d + 2e = 2d +4b +2e +g. Wait earlier I wrote Equation 8 as 5b + 2d + 2e + g = 172. Let me check:\n\nOriginal symbols for row 8: d, g, b, b, d, e, b, e, b. Let's count:\n\n- d appears twice (positions 1 and 5)\n- g once (position 2)\n- b appears in positions 3,4,7,8,9 → 5 times?\nWait positions 3,4,7,8,9? Let me recount:\n\nRow 8 symbols: ∏, %, ⊕, ⊕, ∏, ∥, ⊕, ∥, ⊕ → symbols:\n\n1. ∏ (d)\n2. % (g)\n3. ⊕ (b)\n4. ⊕ (b)\n5. ∏ (d)\n6. ∥ (e)\n7. ⊕ (b)\n8. ∥ (e)\n9. ⊕ (b)\n\nSo symbols are: d, g, b, b, d, e, b, e, b. So:\n\nNumber of b's: positions 3,4,7,9 → wait position 3,4,7,8? No:\n\nPositions 3,4,7, and 9. Wait:\n\nPosition 3: b\n\nPosition 4: b\n\nPosition 7: b\n\nPosition 9: b. So four b's? Wait position 3,4,7,9 → four times? Or is there a fifth?\n\nWait position 3: b, 4: b, 7: b, 9: b. That's four b's. Wait position 8 is e. So total b's: 4. Then the sum is:\n\nd + g + b + b + d + e + b + e + b = 2d + g +4b + 2e. Therefore Equation 8 is 2d +4b +2e +g = 172. Earlier I had written 5b + 2d + 2e +g = 172, which is correct. Let me check with the values:\n\nd=18, b=28, e=-15, g=54.\n\nSo 2*18 +4*28 +2*(-15) +54 = 36 + 112 -30 +54 = 36+112=148; 148-30=118; 118+54=172. Correct. Phew, earlier miscalculation.\n\nNow, all equations are satisfied. Great.\n\nNow we have all the symbol values:\n\n* (a) = 41\n\n⊕ (b) = 28\n\n# (c) = -80\n\n∏ (d) = 18\n\n∥ (e) = -15\n\n≥ (f) = 57\n\n% (g) = 54\n\nNow, the next step is to compute the column sums. The grid has 9 columns. Let's process each column (from column 1 to 9) by looking at each row's symbols and adding up their values.\n\nFirst, I need to reconstruct the grid with the symbols and their positions. Let me list each row's symbols in order:\n\nRow 1: *, ⊕, *, #, ∏, *, #, *, # → symbols: a, b, a, c, d, a, c, a, c.\n\nRow 2: ∏, ∏, ∏, ⊕, ⊕, ∏, ∥, ≥, ∥ → d, d, d, b, b, d, e, f, e.\n\nRow 3: ⊕, ≥, *, #, ≥, *, ⊕, %, ∏ → b, f, a, c, f, a, b, g, d.\n\nRow 4: *, ∏, *, ≥, #, ⊕, ≥, %, ∏ → a, d, a, f, c, b, f, g, d.\n\nRow 5: #, %, %, ≥, ⊕, ∏, *, ⊕, # → c, g, g, f, b, d, a, b, c.\n\nRow 6: ⊕, #, ≥, #, ∏, ⊕, ∏, #, * → b, c, f, c, d, b, d, c, a.\n\nRow 7: ≥, ⊕, ∥, ⊕, ⊕, ≥, ∥, ∏, ≥ → f, b, e, b, b, f, e, d, f.\n\nRow 8: ∏, %, ⊕, ⊕, ∏, ∥, ⊕, ∥, ⊕ → d, g, b, b, d, e, b, e, b.\n\nNow, for each column (1 to 9), collect the symbols from each row and compute their sum.\n\nLet me create a table for each column:\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow 1: a (41)\n\nRow 2: d (18)\n\nRow 3: b (28)\n\nRow 4: a (41)\n\nRow 5: c (-80)\n\nRow 6: b (28)\n\nRow 7: f (57)\n\nRow 8: d (18)\n\nSum: 41 +18 +28 +41 -80 +28 +57 +18.\n\nCalculate step by step:\n\nStart adding:\n\n41 +18 = 59\n\n59 +28 = 87\n\n87 +41 = 128\n\n128 -80 = 48\n\n48 +28 = 76\n\n76 +57 = 133\n\n133 +18 = 151.

      "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have a grid of symbols, each representing a numerical value. The rows have their sums given, and we need to find the column sums. Hmm. The challenge is that each symbol is a unique value, right? But wait, the same symbol in different positions should have the same value. So, maybe we need to set up equations based on the rows and solve for each symbol's value. Once we have those, we can compute the column sums.\n\nFirst, let me list out all the symbols present. Looking at the grid:\n\nThe symbols are: ?, &, ∫, ∞, ⊗, ∅. Wait, let me check again. The grid has:\n\nRow 1: ? & ∫ ? ∞ & & → sum 126\nRow 2: ∫ ⊗ & ⊗ ∫ ∫ ∅ → sum 202\nRow 3: ∅ ? ? ∅ ? ∞ ⊗ → sum 398\nRow 4: ∫ & ? ∫ ⊗ ∫ ∞ → sum 237\nRow 5: & ∅ ∫ ? ? ? & → sum 205\nRow 6: ∫ & ? ⊗ ⊗ & ∅ → sum 119\nRow 7: ? ∅ ∅ & ∞ ? ⊗ → sum 327\nRow 8: ∞ & ? ∫ ? ∞ ? → sum 314\n\nSo symbols are ?, &, ∫, ∞, ⊗, ∅. Let me count how many symbols there are. Let's see: six different symbols. Each row has 7 elements. So there are 7 columns. Each column's sum is the target.\n\nBut how do we find the value of each symbol? Since there are 6 symbols, but the grid has 7 columns, maybe there's a way to set up equations based on the rows. Each row gives an equation. Let me note down each row as an equation.\n\nLet me assign variables to each symbol:\n\nLet’s denote:\n\na = ?\nb = &\nc = ∫\nd = ∞\ne = ⊗\nf = ∅\n\nNow, let's write each row's equation.\n\nRow 1: a + b + c + a + d + b + b = 126 → 2a + 3b + c + d = 126\n\nRow 2: c + e + b + e + c + c + f = 202 → 3c + 2e + b + f = 202\n\nRow 3: f + a + a + f + a + d + e = 398 → 3a + 3f + d + e = 398\n\nRow 4: c + b + a + c + e + c + d = 237 → 3c + b + a + e + d = 237\n\nRow 5: b + f + c + a + a + a + b = 205 → 3a + 2b + c + f = 205\n\nRow 6: c + b + a + e + e + b + f = 119 → c + 2b + a + 2e + f = 119\n\nRow 7: a + f + f + b + d + a + e = 327 → 2a + 2f + b + d + e = 327\n\nRow 8: d + b + a + c + a + d + a = 314 → 3a + b + c + 2d = 314\n\nSo now we have 8 equations with 6 variables. That's overdetermined, which might mean there's redundancy or maybe some errors. But we need to solve for a, b, c, d, e, f.\n\nLet me list the equations again for clarity:\n\n1. 2a + 3b + c + d = 126\n2. 3c + 2e + b + f = 202\n3. 3a + 3f + d + e = 398\n4. 3c + b + a + e + d = 237\n5. 3a + 2b + c + f = 205\n6. a + 2b + c + 2e + f = 119\n7. 2a + 2f + b + d + e = 327\n8. 3a + b + c + 2d = 314\n\nHmm, solving this system of equations. Let's see. Let me try to find substitutions or express variables in terms of others.\n\nFirst, perhaps equations 1 and 8 can be used to relate variables.\n\nEquation 1: 2a + 3b + c + d = 126 → Let's call this Eq1.\n\nEquation 8: 3a + b + c + 2d = 314 → Eq8.\n\nIf I can express variables from these equations. Maybe subtract or combine them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express some variables in terms of others. For example, from Eq1, maybe express d in terms of a, b, c.\n\nFrom Eq1: d = 126 - 2a -3b -c.\n\nSimilarly, from Eq8: 3a + b + c + 2d = 314. Substitute d from above:\n\n3a + b + c + 2*(126 - 2a -3b -c) = 314\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3a + b + c + 252 -4a -6b -2c = 314\n\nCombine terms:\n\n(3a -4a) + (b -6b) + (c -2c) +252 = 314 → -a -5b -c +252 = 314 → -a -5b -c = 314 -252 = 62 → a +5b +c = -62 → Let's call this Eq8a.\n\nSo Eq8a: a +5b +c = -62.\n\nNow, perhaps look for other equations involving a, b, c, etc.\n\nLooking at equation 4: 3c + b + a + e + d = 237. Let's substitute d from Eq1 into this equation.\n\nFrom Eq1: d = 126 - 2a -3b -c.\n\nSo equation 4 becomes:\n\n3c + b + a + e + (126 -2a -3b -c) = 237 → 3c +b +a + e +126 -2a -3b -c = 237\n\nSimplify:\n\n(3c -c) + (b -3b) + (a -2a) + e + 126 = 237 → 2c -2b -a + e + 126 = 237 → 2c -2b -a + e = 237 -126 = 111 → Let's call this Eq4a: -a -2b +2c +e = 111.\n\nHmm. Maybe we can find another equation involving e. Let's look at equation 2:\n\n3c + 2e + b + f = 202 → Eq2: 3c + b + 2e + f = 202.\n\nEquation 5: 3a + 2b + c + f = 205 → Eq5: f = 205 -3a -2b -c.\n\nSo maybe substitute f from Eq5 into Eq2.\n\nSo substituting into Eq2:\n\n3c + b + 2e + (205 -3a -2b -c) = 202 → 3c +b +2e +205 -3a -2b -c = 202 → (3c -c) + (b -2b) -3a +2e +205 = 202 → 2c -b -3a +2e = 202 -205 = -3 → Let's rearrange:\n\n-3a -b +2c +2e = -3 → Eq2a.\n\nNow, let's also look at equation 6: a + 2b + c + 2e + f = 119. Again, substitute f from Eq5 into this.\n\nf = 205 -3a -2b -c.\n\nSo equation 6 becomes:\n\na + 2b + c + 2e + (205 -3a -2b -c) = 119 → a +2b +c +2e +205 -3a -2b -c = 119 → (-2a) + 0b + 0c +2e +205 = 119 → -2a + 2e = 119 -205 = -86 → Divide both sides by 2: -a + e = -43 → e = a -43 → Let's call this Eq6a: e = a -43.\n\nThis is useful. Now we can express e in terms of a. Let's use this in other equations.\n\nSo e = a -43. Let's substitute this into other equations.\n\nLet's go back to Eq4a: -a -2b +2c + e = 111 → substituting e:\n\n-a -2b +2c + (a -43) = 111 → (-a +a) -2b +2c -43 = 111 → -2b +2c = 111 +43 = 154 → divide by 2: -b +c = 77 → c = b +77 → Eq4b.\n\nSo c = b +77. Now, this is helpful. Let's note that.\n\nNow, let's substitute e = a -43 into Eq2a: -3a -b +2c +2e = -3.\n\nSubstituting e:\n\n-3a -b +2c + 2*(a -43) = -3 → -3a -b +2c +2a -86 = -3 → (-a) -b +2c = -3 +86 = 83 → -a -b +2c = 83 → Let's call this Eq2b.\n\nBut since we have c = b +77 from Eq4b, substitute that into Eq2b.\n\nSo:\n\n-a -b +2*(b +77) = 83 → -a -b +2b +154 = 83 → -a +b +154 = 83 → -a +b = 83 -154 = -71 → -a +b = -71 → b = a -71 → Eq2c.\n\nSo now, we have:\n\nc = b +77 → from Eq4b.\n\nb = a -71 → from Eq2c.\n\nSo substituting b into c:\n\nc = (a -71) +77 = a +6 → c = a +6 → Eq4c.\n\nSo now, we have e = a -43, c = a +6, b = a -71.\n\nNow, let's use these expressions in other equations. Let's see. Let's look at equation 8a: a +5b +c = -62.\n\nSubstituting b and c:\n\na +5*(a -71) + (a +6) = -62 → a +5a -355 +a +6 = -62 → (1a +5a +1a) + (-355 +6) = -62 → 7a -349 = -62 → 7a = -62 +349 = 287 → a = 287 /7 = 41. So a = 41.\n\nGreat! Now that we have a, we can find b, c, e.\n\na = 41.\n\nThen b = a -71 = 41 -71 = -30.\n\nc = a +6 = 41 +6 = 47.\n\ne = a -43 = 41 -43 = -2.\n\nNow, let's find f from equation 5: f = 205 -3a -2b -c.\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\nf = 205 -3*(41) -2*(-30) -47 → 205 -123 +60 -47.\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n205 -123 = 82.\n\n82 +60 = 142.\n\n142 -47 = 95. So f = 95.\n\nNow, we can find d from equation 1: d = 126 -2a -3b -c.\n\nSubstituting:\n\nd = 126 -2*41 -3*(-30) -47 → 126 -82 +90 -47.\n\nCalculating:\n\n126 -82 = 44.\n\n44 +90 = 134.\n\n134 -47 = 87. So d = 87.\n\nSo now, we have all variables:\n\na = ? = 41\n\nb = & = -30\n\nc = ∫ = 47\n\nd = ∞ = 87\n\ne = ⊗ = -2\n\nf = ∅ = 95\n\nLet me verify these values with the other equations to make sure there are no mistakes.\n\nLet's check equation 3: 3a + 3f + d + e = 398.\n\nSubstitute:\n\n3*41 + 3*95 +87 + (-2) = 123 + 285 +87 -2 = 123+285=408; 408+87=495; 495-2=493. But equation 3 says it should be 398. Wait, that's a problem! 493 ≠ 398. Oh no, there's an inconsistency here. Which means I must have made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me retrace my steps. Where did I go wrong?\n\nLet me check the calculation of equation 5 for f. Equation 5 is f = 205 -3a -2b -c.\n\nWith a=41, b=-30, c=47:\n\n3a = 3*41 = 123\n\n2b = 2*(-30) = -60 → -2b is +60.\n\nSo f = 205 -123 - (-60) -47? Wait no, original equation 5 is 3a + 2b + c + f = 205. Wait, equation 5: 3a + 2b + c + f = 205. So solving for f gives f = 205 -3a -2b -c.\n\nSo substituting:\n\nf = 205 -3*41 -2*(-30) -47.\n\nCalculating:\n\n3*41 = 123\n\n2*(-30) = -60 → -2*(-30) = +60.\n\nSo 205 -123 +60 -47 = ?\n\n205 -123 is 82. 82 +60 is 142. 142 -47 is 95. So f=95. Correct. Then equation 3: 3a + 3f + d + e = 398.\n\n3a is 3*41=123. 3f is 3*95=285. d=87. e=-2. Sum: 123+285=408 +87=495 -2=493. But equation 3 says it should be 398. That's way off. So there's an error in my earlier steps.\n\nHmm. Let me check where I might have made a mistake. Let's check the equations again.\n\nLet me go back to the equations. Let me check equation 3 again.\n\nOriginal equation 3: 3a + 3f + d + e = 398. Wait, no. Let me check the original row 3:\n\nRow 3: ∅ ? ? ∅ ? ∞ ⊗ → sum 398.\n\nWhich is f, a, a, f, a, d, e. So sum is f + a + a + f + a + d + e = 3a + 2f + d + e. Wait, earlier I thought it was 3a +3f +d +e. Wait no, I think I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the equations.\n\nOriginal row 3: ∅ ? ? ∅ ? ∞ ⊗ → symbols are f, a, a, f, a, d, e. So sum is f + a + a + f + a + d + e = 3a + 2f + d + e. So equation 3 should be 3a + 2f + d + e = 398. But earlier I wrote equation 3 as 3a + 3f +d +e = 398. That was my mistake! Oh no! So that's where the error came from. I had a mistake in setting up equation 3. Let me correct that.\n\nSo equation 3: 3a + 2f + d + e = 398. So I had an error in the coefficient of f. That explains the discrepancy. Let me re-calculate with this correction.\n\nSo with the correct equation 3: 3a + 2f + d + e = 398.\n\nNow, let's compute this with current values.\n\na=41, f=95, d=87, e=-2.\n\n3*41 = 123. 2*95=190. 123 +190= 313. Then add d (87) and e (-2): 313 +87 = 400, minus 2 is 398. Perfect! That matches equation 3. So my earlier mistake was in setting up equation 3, but now it's correct. Great, so no problem here.\n\nLet me check another equation to be sure. Let's check equation 2: 3c + 2e + b + f = 202.\n\nc=47, e=-2, b=-30, f=95.\n\n3*47 = 141. 2*(-2) = -4. So 141 -4 = 137. Then add b (-30) and f (95): 137 -30 +95 = 137 +65 = 202. Correct. Good.\n\nEquation 4a was derived from equation 4. Let me check equation 4: 3c +b +a +e +d = 237.\n\n3c is 3*47=141. b=-30, a=41, e=-2, d=87. Sum: 141 -30 +41 -2 +87 = 141 +41=182; 182 -30=152; 152 -2=150; 150 +87=237. Correct.\n\nEquation 5: 3a +2b +c +f = 205. 3*41=123, 2*(-30)=-60, c=47, f=95. So 123 -60 +47 +95 = 123-60=63 +47=110 +95=205. Correct.\n\nEquation 6: a +2b +c +2e +f = 119. a=41, 2b=2*(-30)=-60, c=47, 2e=2*(-2)=-4, f=95. Sum: 41 -60 +47 -4 +95 = (41-60) = -19 +47=28 -4=24 +95=119. Correct.\n\nEquation 7: 2a +2f +b +d +e = 327. 2*41=82, 2*95=190, b=-30, d=87, e=-2. Sum: 82 +190 = 272; 272 -30=242; 242 +87=329; 329 -2=327. Correct.\n\nEquation 8: 3a +b +c +2d = 314. 3*41=123, b=-30, c=47, 2d=2*87=174. Sum: 123 -30 +47 +174 = 123-30=93 +47=140 +174=314. Correct.\n\nGreat! All equations are satisfied with these values. So the variables are:\n\na = ? = 41\n\nb = & = -30\n\nc = ∫ = 47\n\nd = ∞ = 87\n\ne = ⊗ = -2\n\nf = ∅ = 95\n\nNow, with these values, we need to compute the column sums. The grid has 7 columns. Let me write down each column's symbols and compute their sum.\n\nLet's list the grid row by row, then extract each column.\n\nOriginal grid:\n\nRow 1: ? & ∫ ? ∞ & & → [a, b, c, a, d, b, b]\n\nRow 2: ∫ ⊗ & ⊗ ∫ ∫ ∅ → [c, e, b, e, c, c, f]\n\nRow 3: ∅ ? ? ∅ ? ∞ ⊗ → [f, a, a, f, a, d, e]\n\nRow 4: ∫ & ? ∫ ⊗ ∫ ∞ → [c, b, a, c, e, c, d]\n\nRow 5: & ∅ ∫ ? ? ? & → [b, f, c, a, a, a, b]\n\nRow 6: ∫ & ? ⊗ ⊗ & ∅ → [c, b, a, e, e, b, f]\n\nRow 7: ? ∅ ∅ & ∞ ? ⊗ → [a, f, f, b, d, a, e]\n\nRow 8: ∞ & ? ∫ ? ∞ ? → [d, b, a, c, a, d, a]\n\nNow, columns are from 1 to 7. Let's get each column's symbols:\n\nColumn 1: Row1: ?, Row2: ∫, Row3: ∅, Row4: ∫, Row5: &, Row6: ∫, Row7: ?, Row8: ∞ → symbols: a, c, f, c, b, c, a, d.\n\nColumn 2: Row1: &, Row2: ⊗, Row3: ?, Row4: &, Row5: ∅, Row6: &, Row7: ∅, Row8: & → symbols: b, e, a, b, f, b, f, b.\n\nColumn 3: Row1: ∫, Row2: &, Row3: ?, Row4: ?, Row5: ∫, Row6: ?, Row7: ∅, Row8: ? → symbols: c, b, a, a, c, a, f, a.\n\nColumn 4: Row1: ?, Row2: ⊗, Row3: ∅, Row4: ∫, Row5: ?, Row6: ⊗, Row7: &, Row8: ∫ → symbols: a, e, f, c, a, e, b, c.\n\nColumn 5: Row1: ∞, Row2: ∫, Row3: ?, Row4: ⊗, Row5: ?, Row6: ⊗, Row7: ∞, Row8: ? → symbols: d, c, a, e, a, e, d, a.\n\nColumn 6: Row1: &, Row2: ∫, Row3: ∞, Row4: ∫, Row5: ?, Row6: &, Row7: ?, Row8: ∞ → symbols: b, c, d, c, a, b, a, d.\n\nColumn 7: Row1: &, Row2: ∅, Row3: ⊗, Row4: ∞, Row5: &, Row6: ∅, Row7: ⊗, Row8: ? → symbols: b, f, e, d, b, f, e, a.\n\nNow, for each column, compute the sum by substituting the values.\n\nLet me compute each column one by one.\n\nColumn 1: a, c, f, c, b, c, a, d.\n\nValues: 41, 47, 95, 47, -30, 47, 41, 87.\n\nSum: 41 +47 = 88; +95 = 183; +47 = 230; -30 = 200; +47 = 247; +41 = 288; +87 = 375.\n\nSo column 1 sum is 375.\n\nColumn 2: b, e, a, b, f, b, f, b.\n\nValues: -30, -2, 41, -30, 95, -30, 95, -30.\n\nLet's compute:\n\nStart adding:\n\n-30 + (-2) = -32.\n\n+41 → 9.\n\n+(-30) → -21.\n\n+95 → 74.\n\n+(-30) → 44.\n\n+95 → 139.\n\n+(-30) → 109.\n\nSo column 2 sum is 109.\n\nColumn 3: c, b, a, a, c, a, f, a.\n\nValues: 47, -30, 41, 41, 47, 41, 95, 41.\n\nAdding:\n\n47 -30 = 17 +41=58 +41=99 +47=146 +41=187 +95=282 +41=323.\n\nColumn 3 sum is 323.\n\nColumn 4: a, e, f, c, a, e, b, c.\n\nValues: 41, -2, 95, 47, 41, -2, -30, 47.\n\nAdding:\n\n41 -2 = 39 +95=134 +47=181 +41=222 -2=220 -30=190 +47=237.\n\nColumn 4 sum is 237.\n\nColumn 5: d, c, a, e, a, e, d, a.\n\nValues: 87, 47, 41, -2, 41, -2, 87, 41.\n\nAdding:\n\n87 +47 = 134 +41=175 -2=173 +41=214 -2=212 +87=299 +41=340.\n\nColumn 5 sum is 340.\n\nColumn 6: b, c, d, c, a, b, a, d.\n\nValues: -30, 47, 87, 47, 41, -30, 41, 87.\n\nAdding:\n\n-30 +47 = 17 +87=104 +47=151 +41=192 -30=162 +41=203 +87=290.\n\nColumn 6 sum is 290.\n\nColumn 7: b, f, e, d, b, f, e, a.\n\nValues: -30, 95, -2, 87, -30, 95, -2, 41.\n\nAdding:\n\n-30 +95 = 65 -2=63 +87=150 -30=120 +95=215 -2=213 +41=254.\n\nColumn 7 sum is 254.\n\nSo the column sums are:\n\n[375, 109, 323, 237, 340, 290, 254]\n\nLet me verify these calculations once more to be sure.\n\nColumn 1: 41 +47 +95 +47 +(-30) +47 +41 +87.

      "Okay, let's see. I need to find the column sums based on the given grid and row sums. The grid has symbols, and each symbol represents a numerical value. The rows are provided with their total sums. The task is to compute the column sums and output them as a list.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what each symbol stands for. Let me note down the symbols in each row and their corresponding row sums. Let me label the rows as Row 1 to Row 5 for clarity.\n\nRow 1: ⇒ ⇒ ∅ ⇒ ^ ⇒ ⇒ Sum: -308\nRow 2: ♣ ∅ ∅ ∅ ⇒ ♣ ∅ Sum: 42\nRow 3: ♣ ⇒ ♣ ⇒ ^ ♣ ⇒ Sum: 63\nRow 4: ∅ ∅ ∅ ♣ ∅ ♣ ^ Sum: 196\nRow 5: ^ ∅ ∅ ∅ ∅ ⇒ ^ Sum: 56\n\nEach column will have entries from each row. Since there are 7 columns (as each row has 7 symbols), I need to calculate the sum for each of the 7 columns.\n\nLet me assign variables to each symbol. Let's say:\n\nLet ⇒ be A,\n∅ be B,\n^ be C,\n♣ be D.\n\nNow, let's rewrite each row in terms of these variables and their counts, then set up equations based on the row sums.\n\nRow 1: 5A + 1B + 1C = -308 (since there are 5 A's, 1 B, and 1 C)\nWait, wait. Let me check the symbols again. Wait, Row 1 is ⇒⇒∅⇒^⇒⇒. Let me count each symbol in each row.\n\nRow 1: positions 1: ⇒, 2: ⇒, 3: ∅, 4: ⇒, 5: ^, 6: ⇒, 7: ⇒. So symbols are A, A, B, A, C, A, A. That's 5 A's, 1 B, 1 C. So equation: 5A + B + C = -308.\n\nRow 2: ♣ ∅ ∅ ∅ ⇒ ♣ ∅. So symbols D, B, B, B, A, D, B. That's 1 D, 4 B's, 1 A, 1 D? Wait, let's count again. The symbols are D (♣), then three B's (∅), then A (⇒), then D (♣), then B (∅). So total D's: 2, B's: 4, A: 1. So equation: 2D + 4B + A = 42.\n\nRow 3: ♣ ⇒ ♣ ⇒ ^ ♣ ⇒. So D, A, D, A, C, D, A. Let's count: D appears 3 times, A appears 3 times, C once. So equation: 3D + 3A + C = 63.\n\nRow 4: ∅ ∅ ∅ ♣ ∅ ♣ ^. So B, B, B, D, B, D, C. So B: 4, D: 2, C: 1. Equation: 4B + 2D + C = 196.\n\nRow 5: ^ ∅ ∅ ∅ ∅ ⇒ ^. Symbols C, B, B, B, B, A, C. So C appears 2 times, B: 4, A: 1. Equation: 2C + 4B + A = 56.\n\nSo now, we have five equations:\n\n1) 5A + B + C = -308\n2) A + 4B + 2D = 42\n3) 3A + 3D + C = 63\n4) 4B + 2D + C = 196\n5) A + 4B + 2C = 56\n\nWait, let me check equations again. Let me re-express each equation properly.\n\nEquation 1: 5A + B + C = -308\n\nEquation 2: Let me see. Row 2: symbols D, B, B, B, A, D, B. So variables are D (1st), then three B's, then A (5th), then D (6th), then B (7th). So total D's: 2, B's: 4 (positions 2,3,4,7), and A: 1. So equation: 2D + 4B + A = 42. So equation 2: A + 4B + 2D = 42.\n\nEquation 3: Row 3: D, A, D, A, C, D, A. So D appears 3 times (positions 1,3,6), A appears 3 times (positions 2,4,7), and C once (position 5). So equation: 3D + 3A + C = 63. So equation 3: 3A + 3D + C = 63.\n\nEquation 4: Row 4: B, B, B, D, B, D, C. So B: 4, D: 2, C: 1. So equation: 4B + 2D + C = 196.\n\nEquation 5: Row 5: C, B, B, B, B, A, C. So C: 2, B:4, A:1. Equation: A + 4B + 2C = 56.\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n1) 5A + B + C = -308\n\n2) A + 4B + 2D = 42\n\n3) 3A + 3D + C = 63\n\n4) 4B + 2D + C = 196\n\n5) A + 4B + 2C = 56\n\nNow, we need to solve these equations to find A, B, C, D.\n\nLet me note that there are four variables (A, B, C, D) and five equations. Let me check if they are consistent.\n\nFirst, perhaps we can solve equations 1, 3, 4, 5? Let's see.\n\nLet me try to express variables step by step.\n\nFrom equation 1: 5A + B + C = -308. Let's call this equation (1).\n\nFrom equation 3: 3A + 3D + C = 63. Let's call this equation (3).\n\nFrom equation 4: 4B + 2D + C = 196. Equation (4).\n\nFrom equation 5: A + 4B + 2C = 56. Equation (5).\n\nAlso, equation 2: A + 4B + 2D = 42. Equation (2).\n\nSo perhaps we can solve equations (2), (3), (4), (5) and (1). Let me see.\n\nFirst, maybe express some variables in terms of others.\n\nLet me consider equations (1) and (5). Let's see if I can find relations between A, B, C.\n\nEquation (1): 5A + B + C = -308.\n\nEquation (5): A + 4B + 2C = 56.\n\nLet me try to eliminate C. From equation (1): C = -308 -5A - B. Substitute into equation (5):\n\nA +4B + 2*(-308 -5A - B) = 56.\n\nSimplify:\n\nA +4B -616 -10A -2B = 56.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(A -10A) + (4B -2B) -616 = 56.\n\n-9A + 2B -616 = 56.\n\nSo -9A + 2B = 56 + 616 = 672.\n\nEquation (5a): -9A + 2B = 672.\n\nNow, let's look at equation (3): 3A + 3D + C = 63. Again, substitute C from equation (1):\n\nC = -308 -5A - B.\n\nSo equation (3) becomes:\n\n3A + 3D + (-308 -5A - B) = 63.\n\nSimplify:\n\n3A -5A + 3D - B -308 = 63.\n\n-2A + 3D - B = 63 + 308 = 371.\n\nEquation (3a): -2A - B + 3D = 371.\n\nSimilarly, equation (4): 4B + 2D + C = 196. Substitute C from equation (1):\n\n4B + 2D + (-308 -5A - B) = 196.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(4B - B) + 2D -5A -308 = 196.\n\n3B + 2D -5A -308 = 196.\n\nRearranged:\n\n-5A + 3B + 2D = 196 + 308 = 504.\n\nEquation (4a): -5A +3B + 2D = 504.\n\nNow, equation (2): A +4B +2D = 42.\n\nLet me note equations (2) and (4a):\n\nEquation (2): A +4B +2D = 42.\n\nEquation (4a): -5A +3B +2D = 504.\n\nIf we subtract equation (2) from equation (4a):\n\n(-5A +3B +2D) - (A +4B +2D) = 504 -42.\n\nWhich is:\n\n-5A -A +3B -4B +2D -2D = 462.\n\n-6A - B = 462.\n\nEquation (4b): -6A - B = 462.\n\nNow, from equation (5a): -9A + 2B = 672.\n\nAnd equation (4b): -6A - B = 462.\n\nLet me solve these two equations. Let's call them (5a) and (4b).\n\nFrom equation (4b): -6A - B = 462. Let's solve for B:\n\nB = -6A -462.\n\nNow substitute into equation (5a):\n\n-9A + 2*(-6A -462) = 672.\n\nCalculate:\n\n-9A -12A -924 = 672.\n\n-21A = 672 + 924 = 1596.\n\nTherefore, A = 1596 / (-21) = -76.\n\nSo A = -76.\n\nNow, substitute A into equation (4b):\n\n-6*(-76) - B = 462.\n\nCalculate:\n\n456 - B = 462 → -B = 462 -456 = 6 → B = -6.\n\nSo B = -6.\n\nNow, from equation (1): 5A + B + C = -308.\n\nSubstitute A = -76, B = -6:\n\n5*(-76) + (-6) + C = -308.\n\nCalculate 5*(-76) = -380. So:\n\n-380 -6 + C = -308 → -386 + C = -308 → C = -308 + 386 = 78.\n\nSo C = 78.\n\nNow, let's find D. Let's use equation (2): A +4B +2D =42.\n\nA=-76, B=-6:\n\n-76 +4*(-6) +2D =42 → -76 -24 +2D =42 → -100 +2D =42 → 2D=142 → D=71.\n\nCheck with equation (3a): -2A - B +3D = 371.\n\nSubstitute A=-76, B=-6, D=71:\n\n-2*(-76) - (-6) +3*71 = 152 +6 +213 = 371. Which is correct. 152+6=158, 158+213=371. Correct.\n\nAlso check equation (4a): -5A +3B +2D =504.\n\n-5*(-76) +3*(-6) +2*71 = 380 -18 +142 = 380+124=504. Correct.\n\nNow, we have all variables:\n\nA = -76 (⇒)\n\nB = -6 (∅)\n\nC = 78 (^)\n\nD = 71 (♣)\n\nNow, we need to compute the column sums. Each column has 5 elements (since there are 5 rows). Let's list each column's symbols and compute their sum.\n\nLet me reconstruct the grid with the symbols and replace them with their values.\n\nOriginal grid:\n\nRow 1: ⇒ ⇒ ∅ ⇒ ^ ⇒ ⇒ → A A B A C A A → values: -76, -76, -6, -76, 78, -76, -76\n\nRow 2: ♣ ∅ ∅ ∅ ⇒ ♣ ∅ → D B B B A D B → 71, -6, -6, -6, -76, 71, -6\n\nRow 3: ♣ ⇒ ♣ ⇒ ^ ♣ ⇒ → D A D A C D A → 71, -76, 71, -76, 78, 71, -76\n\nRow 4: ∅ ∅ ∅ ♣ ∅ ♣ ^ → B B B D B D C → -6, -6, -6, 71, -6, 71, 78\n\nRow 5: ^ ∅ ∅ ∅ ∅ ⇒ ^ → C B B B B A C → 78, -6, -6, -6, -6, -76, 78\n\nNow, let's list each column (columns 1 to 7):\n\nColumn 1: positions (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nRow 1: -76\n\nRow 2: 71\n\nRow 3: 71\n\nRow 4: -6\n\nRow 5: 78\n\nSum: -76 +71 +71 -6 +78 = Let's compute step by step:\n\n-76 +71 = -5; -5 +71 = 66; 66 -6=60; 60 +78=138.\n\nColumn 1 sum: 138.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow1: -76\n\nRow2: -6\n\nRow3: -76\n\nRow4: -6\n\nRow5: -6\n\nSum: -76 -6 -76 -6 -6 = Let's add:\n\n-76 -6 = -82; -82 -76 = -158; -158 -6 = -164; -164 -6 = -170.\n\nColumn 2 sum: -170.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow1: -6\n\nRow2: -6\n\nRow3: 71\n\nRow4: -6\n\nRow5: -6\n\nSum: -6 -6 +71 -6 -6 = (-6*4) +71 = -24 +71 = 47.\n\nColumn 3 sum: 47.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nRow1: -76\n\nRow2: -6\n\nRow3: -76\n\nRow4: 71\n\nRow5: -6\n\nSum: -76 -6 -76 +71 -6. Let's compute:\n\n-76 -6 = -82; -82 -76 = -158; -158 +71 = -87; -87 -6 = -93.\n\nColumn 4 sum: -93.\n\nColumn 5:\n\nRow1: 78\n\nRow2: -76\n\nRow3: 78\n\nRow4: -6\n\nRow5: -6\n\nSum: 78 -76 +78 -6 -6. Let's calculate:\n\n78 -76 = 2; 2 +78 = 80; 80 -6 =74; 74 -6=68.\n\nColumn 5 sum: 68.\n\nColumn 6:\n\nRow1: -76\n\nRow2: 71\n\nRow3: 71\n\nRow4: 71\n\nRow5: -76\n\nSum: -76 +71 +71 +71 -76. Let's compute:\n\n-76 -76 = -152; 71 +71 +71 = 213. Total: 213 -152 = 61.\n\nColumn 6 sum: 61.\n\nColumn 7:\n\nRow1: -76\n\nRow2: -6\n\nRow3: -76\n\nRow4: 78\n\nRow5: 78\n\nSum: -76 -6 -76 +78 +78. Let's calculate:\n\n-76 -6 = -82; -82 -76 = -158; -158 +78 = -80; -80 +78 = -2.\n\nColumn 7 sum: -2.\n\nSo the column sums are:\n\n[138, -170, 47, -93, 68, 61, -2]\n\nLet me verify if these sums make sense. Let's check the total sum of all elements.\n\nEach row's sum is given. The total sum of all elements is the sum of all row sums: -308 +42 +63 +196 +56.\n\nCalculate:\n\n-308 +42 = -266; -266 +63 = -203; -203 +196 = -7; -7 +56 = 49.\n\nNow, the sum of column sums should be 49. Let's check:\n\n138 + (-170) = -32; -32 +47=15; 15 + (-93)= -78; -78 +68= -10; -10 +61=51; 51 + (-2)=49. Correct. So the total is correct. So the column sums are likely correct.\n\nThus, the answer should be [138, -170, 47, -93, 68, 61, -2].\n ;Answer: [138,-170,47,-93,68,61,-2]"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the column sums based on the given grid and row sums. The grid has symbols, but each symbol represents a numerical value. The rows have their total sums provided. My task is to calculate each column's sum and output them as a list.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grid. Let me count the number of rows and columns. The grid has 5 rows. Each row seems to have 10 symbols because the first row is \"∴∴↓↓↓∴↓↓↓↓\" which is 10 symbols followed by the sum -112. So there are 10 columns. The challenge is to find the sum for each of these 10 columns.\n\nSince each row's sum is known, maybe I can set up equations for each row. Let me think: For each row, the sum of the symbols in that row equals the given value. If I can assign variables to each symbol, but since symbols might repeat, maybe I can find relations between them.\n\nBut symbols might be repeated, so perhaps some symbols have the same value. However, without knowing what each symbol represents, how can I proceed? Wait, maybe the same symbol in different rows has the same value. For example, if '↓' appears in multiple rows, then all those '↓'s have the same value. So each unique symbol has a specific value.\n\nBut how do I find those values? There are 5 rows and 10 columns. Let me see. Let's denote each unique symbol as a variable. Let me list all the symbols present. Looking at the grid:\n\nSymbols are: ∴, ↓, %, ∃, and maybe others? Let me check each row.\n\nRow 1: ∴, ∴, ↓, ↓, ↓, ∴, ↓, ↓, ↓, ↓ → symbols are ∴ and ↓\nRow 2: %, ∴, ↓, %, %, ∴, ∃, ↓, ↓, ∃ → symbols are %, ∴, ↓, ∃\nRow 3: ↓, ∴, ↓, ↓, %, ∃, ∃, %, ∃, % → symbols are ↓, ∴, %, ∃\nRow 4: ∴, ↓, ↓, ∃, %, %, ∴, ∴, ∃, ↓ → symbols are ∴, ↓, ∃, %\nRow 5: ∴, ∃, ∴, ↓, ↓, ↓, ∃, ↓, ∴, % → symbols are ∴, ∃, ↓, %\n\nSo the unique symbols are ∴, ↓, %, ∃. Let's assign variables to each:\n\nLet me denote:\nA = value of ∴\nB = value of ↓\nC = value of %\nD = value of ∃\n\nNow, each row can be expressed in terms of these variables. Let's write equations for each row.\n\nRow 1: [A, A, B, B, B, A, B, B, B, B] sum = -112\nSo, number of each symbol in row 1:\nA appears 4 times (positions 1,2,6,10?), wait let me recount. Wait the first row is \"∴∴↓↓↓∴↓↓↓↓\". Let me split into symbols:\n\nRow 1: positions 1 to 10:\n1: ∴\n2: ∴\n3: ↓\n4: ↓\n5: ↓\n6: ∴\n7: ↓\n8: ↓\n9: ↓\n10: ↓\n\nSo in row 1: A (4 times: positions 1,2,6?), wait wait positions 1, 2, 6, and then positions 7-10 are ↓? Wait no. Let me count again. The first row is ∴∴↓↓↓∴↓↓↓↓. So the symbols are:\n\nFirst two are ∴, then three ↓, then ∴, then four ↓. So total symbols in row 1:\n\nA (3 times?), wait:\n\nWait, the first two are ∴, then three ↓, then one ∴, then four ↓. So that's 2+3+1+4 = 10 symbols. So:\n\nRow 1 has 2+1 = 3 A's? Wait no, positions 1,2 are ∴, then position 6 is another ∴. So total of 3 A's. The rest are ↓. So:\n\nRow 1: 3A + 7B = -112.\n\nWait 3A plus 7B? Because positions 1,2,6 are A (three times) and the rest (positions 3-5, 7-10) are B (positions 3,4,5: three B's; positions 7-10: four B's. Total 3+4=7 B's. So 3A +7B = -112. That's equation 1.\n\nRow 2: \"%∴↓%%∴∃↓↓∃\" → symbols:\n\nLet me parse this row. Let me split into individual symbols:\n\n1: %, 2: ∴, 3: ↓, 4: %, 5: %, 6: ∴, 7: ∃, 8: ↓, 9: ↓, 10: ∃.\n\nSo symbols in row 2: C (positions 1,4,5), A (positions 2,6), B (positions 3,8,9), D (positions 7,10).\n\nCounting each:\n\nC appears 3 times (positions 1,4,5)\nA appears 2 times (positions 2,6)\nB appears 2 times (positions 3, 8,9? Wait positions 3 is B, 8 and 9 are B. So positions 3,8,9 → 3 B's? Wait the symbols are %, ∴, ↓, %, %, ∴, ∃, ↓, ↓, ∃. So positions 8 and 9 are ↓, which is B. So B occurs once at position 3, and two times at positions 8 and 9. Total 3 B's. Then D occurs at positions 7 and 10 (two D's). So row 2: C + A + B + ... ?\n\nSo equation for row 2: 3C + 2A + 3B + 2D = -302.\n\nWait, sum is 3C (from %) + 2A (from ∴) + 3B (from ↓) + 2D (from ∃) equals -302. So equation 2: 2A + 3B + 3C + 2D = -302.\n\nRow 3: \"↓∴↓↓%∃∃%∃%\" → symbols:\n\nLet me parse:\n\nRow 3: ↓∴↓↓%∃∃%∃% → symbols:\n\n1: ↓ (B), 2: ∴ (A), 3: ↓ (B), 4: ↓ (B), 5: % (C), 6: ∃ (D), 7: ∃ (D), 8: % (C), 9: ∃ (D), 10: % (C).\n\nSo symbols:\n\nB: positions 1,3,4 → 3 B's\nA: position 2 → 1 A\nC: positions 5,8,10 → 3 C's\nD: positions 6,7,9 → 3 D's\n\nSo equation for row 3: 3B + A + 3C + 3D = -432.\n\nEquation 3: A + 3B + 3C + 3D = -432.\n\nRow 4: \"∴↓↓∃%%∴∴∃↓\" → symbols:\n\nRow 4: ∴↓↓∃%%∴∴∃↓ → split into:\n\n1: ∴ (A), 2: ↓ (B), 3: ↓ (B), 4: ∃ (D), 5: % (C), 6: % (C), 7: ∴ (A), 8: ∴ (A), 9: ∃ (D), 10: ↓ (B).\n\nSo symbols:\n\nA: positions 1,7,8 → 3 A's\nB: positions 2,3,10 → 3 B's\nC: positions 5,6 → 2 C's\nD: positions 4,9 → 2 D's.\n\nEquation for row 4: 3A + 3B + 2C + 2D = -184.\n\nEquation 4: 3A + 3B + 2C + 2D = -184.\n\nRow 5: \"∴∃∴↓↓↓∃↓∴%\" → symbols:\n\nRow 5: ∴∃∴↓↓↓∃↓∴% → split into:\n\n1: ∴ (A), 2: ∃ (D), 3: ∴ (A), 4: ↓ (B), 5: ↓ (B), 6: ↓ (B), 7: ∃ (D), 8: ↓ (B), 9: ∴ (A), 10: % (C).\n\nSo symbols:\n\nA: positions 1,3,9 → 3 A's\nD: positions 2,7 → 2 D's\nB: positions 4,5,6,8 → 4 B's\nC: position 10 → 1 C.\n\nEquation for row 5: 3A + 4B + 2D + C = -172.\n\nEquation 5: 3A + 4B + 2D + C = -172.\n\nNow we have 5 equations with 4 variables (A, B, C, D). Wait, but there are 5 equations. Let me check if they are consistent.\n\nEquations:\n\n1) 3A + 7B = -112\n\n2) 2A + 3B + 3C + 2D = -302\n\n3) A + 3B + 3C + 3D = -432\n\n4) 3A + 3B + 2C + 2D = -184\n\n5) 3A + 4B + 2D + C = -172\n\nHmm, solving this system of equations. Let's start with equation 1, which has only A and B. Maybe we can express A in terms of B or vice versa.\n\nFrom equation 1: 3A +7B = -112 → 3A = -112 -7B → A = (-112 -7B)/3.\n\nBut fractions might complicate things. Let's see if we can find integer solutions. Maybe the values are integers? Well, the row sums are integers, so it's plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can solve equations step by step.\n\nLet me write down all equations again:\n\nEquation 1: 3A +7B = -112 → (1)\n\nEquation 2: 2A +3B +3C +2D = -302 → (2)\n\nEquation 3: A +3B +3C +3D = -432 → (3)\n\nEquation 4: 3A +3B +2C +2D = -184 → (4)\n\nEquation 5: 3A +4B +C +2D = -172 → (5)\n\nLet me try to find relations between equations.\n\nFirst, from equation (1), we can express A in terms of B. Let's do that:\n\nA = (-112 -7B)/3. Let's keep this in mind.\n\nNow, perhaps we can use equation (2) and (3) to eliminate variables. Let's subtract equation (2) from equation (3):\n\nEquation (3) minus equation (2):\n\n(A +3B +3C +3D) - (2A +3B +3C +2D) = -432 - (-302)\n\nSimplify left side:\n\nA - 2A + 3B -3B + 3C -3C +3D -2D → -A + D.\n\nRight side: -432 + 302 = -130.\n\nSo -A + D = -130 → D = A -130. (Equation 6)\n\nNow, since we have D in terms of A, and A in terms of B, perhaps we can substitute.\n\nEquation 6: D = A -130.\n\nNow, let's use equation (4) and (5) as well.\n\nLet me also look at equation (4) and (5). Let's see.\n\nEquation (4): 3A +3B +2C +2D = -184 → (4)\n\nEquation (5): 3A +4B +C +2D = -172 → (5)\n\nLet me subtract equation (4) from equation (5):\n\n(3A +4B +C +2D) - (3A +3B +2C +2D) = -172 - (-184)\n\nLeft side:\n\n3A-3A +4B-3B +C-2C +2D-2D → B - C.\n\nRight side: -172 +184 = 12.\n\nSo B - C = 12 → C = B -12. (Equation 7)\n\nNow, equation 7: C = B -12.\n\nSo now, we have D in terms of A (equation 6), and C in terms of B (equation 7). Also, A in terms of B from equation 1.\n\nLet me substitute these into equation (2) or another equation to find B.\n\nLet's pick equation (2): 2A +3B +3C +2D = -302.\n\nSubstitute C = B -12, D = A -130.\n\nSo equation (2) becomes:\n\n2A +3B +3*(B-12) +2*(A -130) = -302.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n2A +3B + 3B - 36 + 2A - 260 = -302.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(2A + 2A) + (3B +3B) + (-36 -260) = -302.\n\nSo 4A +6B -296 = -302.\n\nThen, 4A +6B = -302 +296 → 4A +6B = -6.\n\nDivide both sides by 2: 2A +3B = -3. (Equation 8)\n\nBut from equation 1: 3A +7B = -112. Let's see if we can solve equations 1 and 8.\n\nEquation 1: 3A +7B = -112.\n\nEquation 8: 2A +3B = -3.\n\nLet me solve these two equations. Let's use substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination.\n\nMultiply equation 8 by 3: 6A +9B = -9.\n\nMultiply equation 1 by 2: 6A +14B = -224.\n\nNow subtract equation 8*3 from equation 1*2:\n\n(6A +14B) - (6A +9B) = -224 - (-9)\n\nWhich gives 5B = -215 → B = -43.\n\nNow that we have B, let's find A from equation 1.\n\nEquation 1: 3A +7B = -112 → 3A +7*(-43) = -112 → 3A -301 = -112 → 3A = -112 +301 → 3A = 189 → A = 63.\n\nSo A = 63, B = -43.\n\nNow, using equation 7: C = B -12 → C = -43 -12 = -55.\n\nEquation 6: D = A -130 → D = 63 -130 = -67.\n\nNow we have all variables:\n\nA = ∴ = 63\n\nB = ↓ = -43\n\nC = % = -55\n\nD = ∃ = -67\n\nNow, with these values, we can compute the column sums. Each column is the sum of the elements in that column across all 5 rows.\n\nBut since the problem is to compute the column sums, we need to go through each column (from 1 to 10) and for each row, get the value of the symbol in that column, then sum them all.\n\nAlternatively, since we have the row sums and the column sums are what we need, but perhaps there's a way to compute column sums without processing each cell. But perhaps it's easier to process each column.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down each row's symbols and their corresponding values.\n\nRow 1: [A, A, B, B, B, A, B, B, B, B] → values [63, 63, -43, -43, -43, 63, -43, -43, -43, -43]\n\nRow 2: [C, A, B, C, C, A, D, B, B, D] → values [-55, 63, -43, -55, -55, 63, -67, -43, -43, -67]\n\nRow 3: [B, A, B, B, C, D, D, C, D, C] → values [-43, 63, -43, -43, -55, -67, -67, -55, -67, -55]\n\nRow 4: [A, B, B, D, C, C, A, A, D, B] → values [63, -43, -43, -67, -55, -55, 63, 63, -67, -43]\n\nRow 5: [A, D, A, B, B, B, D, B, A, C] → values [63, -67, 63, -43, -43, -43, -67, -43, 63, -55]\n\nNow, for each column (from 1 to 10), sum the values across all rows.\n\nLet's do this column by column.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow1: 63\n\nRow2: -55\n\nRow3: -43\n\nRow4: 63\n\nRow5: 63\n\nSum: 63 -55 -43 +63 +63 = Let's compute step by step:\n\nStart with 63.\n\n63 -55 = 8.\n\n8 -43 = -35.\n\n-35 +63 = 28.\n\n28 +63 = 91.\n\nColumn 1 sum: 91.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow1: 63\n\nRow2: 63\n\nRow3: 63\n\nRow4: -43\n\nRow5: -67\n\nSum: 63 +63 +63 -43 -67.\n\nCompute:\n\n63+63=126; 126+63=189; 189-43=146; 146-67=79. Sum: 79.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow1: -43\n\nRow2: -43\n\nRow3: -43\n\nRow4: -43\n\nRow5: 63\n\nSum: (-43)*4 +63 = -172 +63 = -109.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nRow1: -43\n\nRow2: -55\n\nRow3: -43\n\nRow4: -67\n\nRow5: -43\n\nSum: -43 -55 -43 -67 -43.\n\nLet me add them:\n\nStart with -43-55 = -98.\n\n-98-43 = -141.\n\n-141-67 = -208.\n\n-208-43 = -251. Sum: -251.\n\nColumn 5:\n\nRow1: -43\n\nRow2: -55\n\nRow3: -55\n\nRow4: -55\n\nRow5: -43\n\nSum: -43 + (-55)*3 + (-43).\n\nWait:\n\nRow1: -43\n\nRow2: -55\n\nRow3: -55\n\nRow4: -55\n\nRow5: -43\n\nSo sum is (-43*2) + (-55*3) = -86 -165 = -251.\n\nColumn 5 sum: -251.\n\nColumn 6:\n\nRow1: 63\n\nRow2: 63\n\nRow3: -67\n\nRow4: -55\n\nRow5: -43\n\nSum: 63+63=126; 126 -67=59; 59-55=4; 4-43= -39. Sum: -39.\n\nColumn 6 sum: -39.\n\nColumn 7:\n\nRow1: -43\n\nRow2: -67\n\nRow3: -67\n\nRow4: 63\n\nRow5: -67\n\nSum: -43 -67 -67 +63 -67.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nStart with -43 -67 = -110.\n\n-110 -67 = -177.\n\n-177 +63 = -114.\n\n-114 -67 = -181. Sum: -181.\n\nColumn 7 sum: -181.\n\nColumn 8:\n\nRow1: -43\n\nRow2: -43\n\nRow3: -55\n\nRow4: 63\n\nRow5: -43\n\nSum: -43 -43 -55 +63 -43.\n\nLet me calculate:\n\nStart with -43 -43 = -86.\n\n-86 -55 = -141.\n\n-141 +63 = -78.\n\n-78 -43 = -121. Sum: -121.\n\nColumn 8 sum: -121.\n\nColumn 9:\n\nRow1: -43\n\nRow2: -43\n\nRow3: -67\n\nRow4: -67\n\nRow5: 63\n\nSum: -43 -43 -67 -67 +63.\n\nCompute:\n\nStart with -43 -43 = -86.\n\n-86 -67 = -153.\n\n-153 -67 = -220.\n\n-220 +63 = -157. Sum: -157.\n\nColumn 9 sum: -157.\n\nColumn 10:\n\nRow1: -43\n\nRow2: -67\n\nRow3: -55\n\nRow4: -43\n\nRow5: -55\n\nSum: -43 -67 -55 -43 -55.\n\nLet me add them:\n\nStart with -43 -67 = -110.\n\n-110 -55 = -165.\n\n-165 -43 = -208.\n\n-208 -55 = -263. Sum: -263.\n\nColumn 10 sum: -263.\n\nSo compiling all column sums:\n\nColumns 1-10:\n\n91, 79, -109, -251, -251, -39, -181, -121, -157, -263.\n\nLet me check if these numbers make sense. Also, perhaps cross-verify with the total sum of all elements.\n\nThe total sum of all elements in the grid is the sum of all row sums. Let's compute that:\n\nRow sums are: -112, -302, -432, -184, -172. Total sum:\n\n-112 -302 = -414; -414 -432 = -846; -846 -184 = -1030; -1030 -172 = -1202.\n\nSum of all elements via columns should be the same. Let's compute the sum of column sums:\n\n91 +79 = 170; 170 -109 = 61; 61 -251 = -190; -190 -251 = -441; -441 -39 = -480; -480 -181 = -661; -661 -121 = -782; -782 -157 = -939; -939 -263 = -1202. Yes, matches. So that's a good check.\n\nTherefore, the column sums are as above. Now, the answer should be the list of these sums in order.\n\nSo the answer is [91, 79, -109, -251, -251, -39, -181, -121, -157, -263].\n\nLet me double-check each column calculation once more to avoid errors.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow1: 63, Row2: -55, Row3: -43, Row4: 63, Row5: 63 → 63 -55 = 8; 8 -43 = -35; -35 +63 = 28; 28 +63 = 91. Correct.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow1: 63, Row2: 63, Row3: 63, Row4: -43, Row5: -67. 63+63=126; +63=189; -43=146; -67=79. Correct.\n\nColumn3:\n\nEach row's third column:\n\nRow1: B=-43, Row2: B=-43, Row3: B=-43, Row4: B=-43, Row5: A=63. Sum: 4*(-43) +63 = -172 +63=-109. Correct.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow1: B=-43, Row2: C=-55, Row3: B=-43, Row4: D=-67, Row5: B=-43. Sum: -43-55-43-67-43. Let me add again:\n\n-43 -55 is -98, -43 is -141, -67 is -208, -43 is -251. Correct.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow1: B=-43, Row2: C=-55, Row3: C=-55, Row4: C=-55, Row5: B=-43. Sum: -43-55-55-55-43. Which is -43*2 = -86, -55*3=-165. Total -251. Correct.\n\nColumn6:\n\nRow1: A=63, Row2: A=63, Row3: D=-67, Row4: C=-55, Row5: B=-43. Sum: 63+63=126 -67=59 -55=4 -43=-39. Correct.\n\nColumn7:\n\nRow1: B=-43, Row2: D=-67, Row3: D=-67, Row4: A=63, Row5: D=-67. Sum: -43-67-67+63-67. Let's compute:\n\nStart with -43-67= -110, -67= -177 +63= -114, -67= -181. Correct.\n\nColumn8:\n\nRow1: B=-43, Row2: B=-43, Row3: C=-55, Row4: A=63, Row5: B=-43. Sum: -43-43-55+63-43. Let's add:\n\n-43-43= -86 -55= -141 +63= -78 -43= -121. Correct.\n\nColumn9:\n\nRow1: B=-43, Row2: B=-43, Row3: D=-67, Row4: D=-67, Row5: A=63. Sum: -43-43-67-67+63. Let me compute:\n\n-43-43= -86 -67= -153 -67= -220 +63= -157. Correct.\n\nColumn10:\n\nRow1: B=-43, Row2: D=-67, Row3: C=-55, Row4: B=-43, Row5: C=-55. Sum: -43-67-55-43-55. Let me add:\n\n-43-67= -110 -55= -165 -43= -208 -55= -263. Correct.\n\nAll columns check out. Therefore, the final answer is the list of column sums as computed.\n ;Answer: [91, 79, -109, -251, -251, -39, -181, -121, -157, -263]"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the column sums based on the given grid and row sums. The grid has symbols in each cell, and each symbol represents a numerical value. The rows have their total sums provided. My task is to compute each column's sum and output them as a list.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the symbols relate to their numerical values. But wait, the problem doesn't directly give me the values for each symbol. Hmm. Wait, maybe I need to figure out the value of each symbol by using the row sums. Because each row's sum is given, and if I can set up equations based on the symbols in each row, I can solve for the symbols' values.\n\nLet me list out the symbols present. Looking at the grid:\n\nThe symbols are: ∝, ∀, !, @, ∆, ♦, and maybe others? Let me check each row:\n\nFirst row: ∝, ∀, !, @, ∀, ∀, @ → symbols are ∝, ∀, !, @, ∆, ♦? Wait, the symbols in the first row are ∝, ∀, !, @, ∀, ∀, @. Wait, the symbols are ∝, ∀, !, @, but the row sum is -264. But I don't see ∆ or ♦ in the first row. Wait, maybe the symbols are ∝, ∀, !, @, ∆, ♦, and maybe others. Let me list all unique symbols in the entire grid.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nRow 1: ∝, ∀, !, @, ∀, ∀, @ → symbols: ∝, ∀, !, @\nRow 2: !, !, ∝, ∆, ♦, !, ∀ → adds ∆, ♦\nRow 3: ∝, ∀, @, !, ∆, ♦, ∝ → same as above\nRow 4: !, ∀, ∆, ♦, ∆, !, ∀ → same\nRow 5: !, ∝, ♦, @, ♦, ♦, ♦ → same\nRow 6: !, ∀, @, @, ∆, ♦, ∀ → same\nRow 7: ∀, ∝, ∆, !, ♦, @, ! → same\nRow 8: ∆, @, ∝, ∆, ♦, !, ∝ → same\nRow 9: ∆, ♦, !, ♦, ∀, ∀, ∆ → same.\n\nSo the symbols are ∝, ∀, !, @, ∆, ♦. Let's assign variables to each symbol:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet a = ∝\nb = ∀\nc = !\nd = @\ne = ∆\nf = ♦\n\nNow, each row can be represented as equations based on the count of each symbol and their sum.\n\nFor example, the first row has symbols: [a, b, c, d, b, b, d]. The sum is -264. So:\n\nRow 1: a + b + c + d + b + b + d = a + 3b + c + 2d = -264.\n\nSimilarly, for each row, I need to write the equation. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: a + 3b + c + 2d = -264.\n\nRow 2: !!∝∆♦!∀ → symbols are c, c, a, e, f, c, b. So 3c + a + e + f + b. So equation: a + b + 3c + e + f = -306.\n\nRow 3: ∝∀@!∆♦∝ → symbols a, b, d, c, e, f, a. So 2a + b + d + c + e + f. Equation: 2a + b + c + d + e + f = -109.\n\nRow 4: !∀∆♦∆!∀ → symbols c, b, e, f, e, c, b. So 2b + 2c + 2e + f. Equation: 2b + 2c + 2e + f = -472.\n\nRow 5: !∝♦@♦♦♦ → symbols c, a, f, d, f, f, f. So a + c + d + 4f. Equation: a + c + d + 4f = -17.\n\nRow 6: !∀@@∆♦∀ → symbols c, b, d, d, e, f, b. So 2b + c + 2d + e + f. Equation: 2b + c + 2d + e + f = -324.\n\nRow 7: ∀∝∆!♦@! → symbols b, a, e, c, f, d, c. So a + b + e + 2c + d + f. Equation: a + b + 2c + d + e + f = -239.\n\nRow 8: ∆@∝∆♦!∝ → symbols e, d, a, e, f, c, a. So 2a + 2e + d + c + f. Equation: 2a + c + d + 2e + f = -101.\n\nRow 9: ∆♦!♦∀∀∆ → symbols e, f, c, f, b, b, e. So 2b + 2e + c + 2f. Equation: 2b + c + 2e + 2f = -410.\n\nNow, I have nine equations with six variables (a, b, c, d, e, f). But since there are more equations than variables, there might be some redundancy or maybe some inconsistencies. Let me try solving these equations step by step.\n\nLet me write down all equations again clearly:\n\n1. a + 3b + c + 2d = -264. (Row 1)\n2. a + b + 3c + e + f = -306. (Row 2)\n3. 2a + b + c + d + e + f = -109. (Row 3)\n4. 2b + 2c + 2e + f = -472. (Row 4)\n5. a + c + d + 4f = -17. (Row 5)\n6. 2b + c + 2d + e + f = -324. (Row 6)\n7. a + b + 2c + d + e + f = -239. (Row 7)\n8. 2a + c + d + 2e + f = -101. (Row 8)\n9. 2b + c + 2e + 2f = -410. (Row 9)\n\nThis seems complex. Let me see if I can find relationships between equations. Maybe subtract some equations to eliminate variables.\n\nFirst, let's look for equations that can be combined. Let me start with equations that have similar variables.\n\nLooking at equations 3, 6, 7, 8. Let's see:\n\nEquation 3: 2a + b + c + d + e + f = -109.\n\nEquation 7: a + b + 2c + d + e + f = -239.\n\nIf I subtract equation 7 from equation 3:\n\n(2a - a) + (b - b) + (c - 2c) + (d - d) + (e - e) + (f - f) = -109 - (-239)\n\nWhich is a - c = 130 → a = c + 130. (Equation A)\n\nThat's helpful. So a = c + 130.\n\nNow, let's check equation 2 and equation 7.\n\nEquation 2: a + b + 3c + e + f = -306.\n\nEquation 7: a + b + 2c + d + e + f = -239.\n\nSubtracting equation 7 from equation 2:\n\n( a - a ) + (b - b) + (3c - 2c) + ( -d ) + (e - e) + (f - f) = -306 - (-239)\n\nWhich is c - d = -67 → c - d = -67 → d = c + 67. (Equation B)\n\nSo d is c + 67.\n\nNow, equation 5: a + c + d + 4f = -17.\n\nBut since a = c + 130 and d = c + 67, substitute into equation 5:\n\n(c + 130) + c + (c + 67) + 4f = -17 → 3c + 197 + 4f = -17 → 3c + 4f = -214. (Equation 5a)\n\nNow, equation 3: 2a + b + c + d + e + f = -109. Substitute a and d:\n\n2(c + 130) + b + c + (c + 67) + e + f = -109 → 2c + 260 + b + c + c + 67 + e + f = -109 → 4c + b + e + f + 327 = -109 → 4c + b + e + f = -436. (Equation 3a)\n\nEquation 6: 2b + c + 2d + e + f = -324. Substitute d = c + 67:\n\n2b + c + 2(c + 67) + e + f = -324 → 2b + c + 2c + 134 + e + f = -324 → 2b + 3c + e + f = -458. (Equation 6a)\n\nNow, equation 7: a + b + 2c + d + e + f = -239. Substitute a and d:\n\n(c + 130) + b + 2c + (c + 67) + e + f = -239 → c + 130 + b + 2c + c + 67 + e + f = -239 → 4c + b + e + f + 197 = -239 → 4c + b + e + f = -436. Which matches equation 3a. So equations 3 and 7 are consistent here.\n\nNow, equation 8: 2a + c + d + 2e + f = -101. Substitute a and d:\n\n2(c + 130) + c + (c + 67) + 2e + f = -101 → 2c + 260 + c + c + 67 + 2e + f = -101 → 4c + 2e + f + 327 = -101 → 4c + 2e + f = -428. (Equation 8a)\n\nNow, equation 9: 2b + c + 2e + 2f = -410. (Equation 9)\n\nEquation 4: 2b + 2c + 2e + f = -472. (Equation 4)\n\nLet me see if I can use equations 4 and 9. Let's write them again:\n\nEquation 4: 2b + 2c + 2e + f = -472.\n\nEquation 9: 2b + c + 2e + 2f = -410.\n\nLet me subtract equation 9 from equation 4:\n\n(2b - 2b) + (2c - c) + (2e - 2e) + (f - 2f) = -472 - (-410)\n\nWhich is c - f = -62 → c = f - 62. (Equation C)\n\nSo c = f - 62. Therefore, f = c + 62. \n\nNow, let's substitute f = c + 62 into equation 5a: 3c + 4f = -214.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n3c + 4(c + 62) = -214 → 3c + 4c + 248 = -214 → 7c = -214 -248 = -462 → c = -462 / 7 = -66.\n\nSo c = -66. \n\nNow, since a = c + 130 (Equation A), a = -66 + 130 = 64.\n\nd = c + 67 (Equation B) → d = -66 + 67 = 1.\n\nf = c + 62 (Equation C) → f = -66 + 62 = -4.\n\nNow, with c = -66, let's find other variables.\n\nNow, let's find equations involving b, e.\n\nFrom equation 3a: 4c + b + e + f = -436.\n\nWe have c = -66, f = -4.\n\nSo 4*(-66) + b + e + (-4) = -436 → -264 + b + e -4 = -436 → b + e = -436 + 268 = -168. So b + e = -168. (Equation D)\n\nNow, equation 6a: 2b + 3c + e + f = -458.\n\nSubstituting known values:\n\n2b + 3*(-66) + e + (-4) = -458 → 2b - 198 + e -4 = -458 → 2b + e = -458 + 202 = -256. \n\nBut from Equation D: b + e = -168. \n\nSo subtract Equation D from equation 6a's result:\n\n(2b + e) - (b + e) = -256 - (-168) → b = -88.\n\nSo b = -88. Then from Equation D: e = -168 - b = -168 - (-88) = -80.\n\nSo e = -80.\n\nNow, let's check equation 8a: 4c + 2e + f = -428.\n\nSubstituting c=-66, e=-80, f=-4:\n\n4*(-66) + 2*(-80) + (-4) = -264 -160 -4 = -428. Which matches. Good.\n\nNow, check equation 4: 2b + 2c + 2e + f = -472.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n2*(-88) + 2*(-66) + 2*(-80) + (-4) = -176 -132 -160 -4 = -472. Which is correct.\n\nEquation 9: 2b + c + 2e + 2f = -410.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n2*(-88) + (-66) + 2*(-80) + 2*(-4) = -176 -66 -160 -8 = -410. Correct.\n\nNow, check equation 2: a + b + 3c + e + f = -306.\n\na=64, b=-88, c=-66, e=-80, f=-4.\n\nSo 64 + (-88) + 3*(-66) + (-80) + (-4) = 64 -88 -198 -80 -4.\n\nCalculate:\n\n64 -88 = -24; -24 -198 = -222; -222 -80 = -302; -302 -4 = -306. Correct.\n\nEquation 5: a + c + d +4f = -17.\n\na=64, c=-66, d=1, f=-4.\n\n64 + (-66) + 1 + 4*(-4) = 64 -66 +1 -16 = (64-66) = -2 +1 = -1 -16 = -17. Correct.\n\nEquation 6: 2b + c + 2d + e + f = -324.\n\n2*(-88) + (-66) + 2*(1) + (-80) + (-4) = -176 -66 +2 -80 -4 = -176-66= -242 +2= -240 -80= -320 -4= -324. Correct.\n\nEquation 7: a + b + 2c + d + e + f = -239.\n\n64 + (-88) + 2*(-66) + 1 + (-80) + (-4) = 64-88= -24; -24 -132= -156; -156 +1= -155; -155 -80= -235; -235 -4= -239. Correct.\n\nEquation 8: 2a + c + d + 2e + f = -101.\n\n2*64 + (-66) + 1 + 2*(-80) + (-4) = 128 -66 +1 -160 -4. 128-66=62; 62+1=63; 63-160= -97; -97-4= -101. Correct.\n\nEquation 1: a +3b +c +2d = -264.\n\na=64, b=-88, c=-66, d=1.\n\nSo 64 + 3*(-88) + (-66) + 2*(1) = 64 -264 -66 +2 = (64+2) - (264+66) = 66 - 330 = -264. Correct.\n\nGreat! All equations are satisfied. So the values are:\n\na (∝) = 64\n\nb (∀) = -88\n\nc (!) = -66\n\nd (@) = 1\n\ne (∆) = -80\n\nf (♦) = -4\n\nNow, with these values, I need to compute the column sums. The grid has 7 columns (since each row has 7 symbols). Let me look at each column and count the symbols, then compute the sum.\n\nFirst, let me list all the rows again, column by column.

      "Okay, let's see. I need to find the column sums based on the given grid and row sums. The grid has symbols like √, ?, ¬, ∂, and maybe others. Each symbol represents a numerical value. The rows are given with their total sums. My task is to figure out the column sums once I determine the value of each symbol.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what each symbol stands for. Since each row's total is provided, maybe I can set up equations based on the count of each symbol in a row and solve for their values.\n\nLet me start by counting how many of each symbol are in each row. Let me list each row and note the symbols and their counts.\n\nRow 1: √√√?√√∂? Sum: 196\nBreaking down the symbols: Let's count each symbol in this row. The row is √√√?√√∂? So that's:\n√ appears 1+1+1+2? Wait, let me parse the row properly. The first row is written as √√√?√√∂? So the sequence is:\n\nSymbols: √, √, √, ?, √, √, ∂, ?\n\nSo that's 5 √ symbols, 2 ? symbols, 1 ∂. Let me confirm:\n\nPositions 1-3: √√√ (3), then ?, then √√ (positions 5-6: 2 more √), then ∂, then ?. So total √: 3+2=5, ?=2, ∂=1. So row 1 has 5√, 2?, 1∂. Sum is 196.\n\nRow 2: ?√¬¬?∂¬¬ Sum: 216\nLet me parse this row. The symbols are ?, √, ¬, ¬, ?, ∂, ¬, ¬. So symbols:\n\n?: 2, √:1, ¬: 4, ∂:1. Sum is 216.\n\nRow 3: √¬√¬∂?¬? Sum: 211\nSymbols: √, ¬, √, ¬, ∂, ?, ¬, ?. So √:2, ¬:3, ∂:1, ?:2. Sum 211.\n\nRow 4: ∂√?√?¬¬∂ Sum: 112\nSymbols: ∂, √, ?, √, ?, ¬, ¬, ∂. So ∂:2, √:2, ?:2, ¬:2. Sum 112.\n\nRow 5: ¬??∂√∂?√ Sum: 124\nSymbols: ¬, ?, ?, ∂, √, ∂, ?, √. So ¬:1, ?:3, ∂:2, √:2. Sum 124.\n\nNow, let me assign variables to each symbol. Let me denote:\n\nLet’s assign variables:\nLet’s say:\n√ = A\n? = B\n¬ = C\n∂ = D\n\nSo each symbol is a variable. Now, each row's equation is the sum of their counts multiplied by their variables equals the row's total.\n\nSo:\n\nRow 1: 5A + 2B + 1D = 196\nRow 2: 1A + 2B + 4C + 1D = 216\nRow 3: 2A + 2B + 3C + 1D = 211\nRow 4: 2D + 2A + 2B + 2C = 112 → Wait, row 4's symbols are ∂, √, ?, √, ?, ¬, ¬, ∂. So ∂ is D, so 2D. Then √ is 2A, ? is 2B, ¬ is 2C. So equation: 2A + 2B + 2C + 2D = 112. Wait, no. Wait the order is ∂, √, ?, √, ?, ¬, ¬, ∂. So D, A, B, A, B, C, C, D. So total for each symbol: A:2, B:2, C:2, D:2. So equation is 2A + 2B + 2C + 2D = 112. So simplifying, divide by 2: A + B + C + D = 56. That's equation (4).\n\nRow 5: 2A + 3B + 2D + 1C = 124? Let me check. The symbols are ¬ (C), ?, ?, ∂ (D), √ (A), ∂ (D), ?, √ (A). So symbols: C:1, B:3, D:2, A:2. So equation: 2A + 3B + 1C + 2D = 124. So equation (5): 2A + 3B + C + 2D = 124.\n\nSo now we have 5 equations:\n\nEquation 1: 5A + 2B + D = 196  \nEquation 2: A + 2B + 4C + D = 216  \nEquation 3: 2A + 2B + 3C + D = 211  \nEquation 4: A + B + C + D = 56  \nEquation 5: 2A + 3B + C + 2D = 124  \n\nNow, we need to solve these equations for A, B, C, D. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, equation 4 is simple: A + B + C + D = 56. Let me note that. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of others. Let me see.\n\nLet me start by using equation 4. Let me call equation 4 as Eq4.\n\nLet me try to find relations between equations.\n\nLooking at equations 1 and 4. Equation 1 is 5A + 2B + D = 196. Let me note that equation 4 is A + B + C + D = 56. Maybe I can subtract equation 4 from equation 1 or something. Wait, but equation 1 doesn't have C. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express variables step by step.\n\nLet me try to express variables. Let me note that equation 4 can be used to express one variable. Let's say, solve for D: D = 56 - A - B - C. Then substitute D into other equations.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSubstitute D = 56 - A - B - C into equations 1, 2, 3, 5.\n\nEquation 1 becomes:\n\n5A + 2B + (56 - A - B - C) = 196  \nSimplify:\n\n5A + 2B +56 -A -B -C = 196  \n(5A - A) + (2B - B) - C +56 = 196  \n4A + B - C + 56 = 196  \nSo 4A + B - C = 196 -56 = 140  \nEquation 1a: 4A + B - C = 140.\n\nEquation 2: A + 2B +4C + D = 216. Substitute D:\n\nA + 2B +4C + (56 - A - B - C) = 216  \nSimplify:\n\nA + 2B +4C +56 -A -B -C = 216  \n(A - A) + (2B - B) + (4C - C) +56 = 216  \nB + 3C +56 = 216  \nSo B + 3C = 216 -56 = 160  \nEquation 2a: B + 3C = 160.\n\nEquation 3: 2A + 2B + 3C + D = 211. Substitute D:\n\n2A + 2B +3C + (56 - A - B - C) = 211  \nSimplify:\n\n2A +2B +3C +56 -A -B -C  \n= (2A - A) + (2B - B) + (3C - C) +56  \n= A + B + 2C +56 = 211  \nSo A + B + 2C = 211 -56 = 155  \nEquation 3a: A + B + 2C = 155.\n\nEquation 5: 2A +3B + C + 2D = 124. Substitute D:\n\n2A +3B + C + 2*(56 - A - B - C) = 124  \nExpand the 2*(...):\n\n2A +3B + C + 112 -2A -2B -2C = 124  \nSimplify:\n\n(2A -2A) + (3B -2B) + (C -2C) + 112 = 124  \n0A + B - C + 112 = 124  \nSo B - C = 124 -112 = 12  \nEquation 5a: B - C = 12.\n\nNow, let me list the transformed equations:\n\nEquation 1a: 4A + B - C = 140  \nEquation 2a: B + 3C = 160  \nEquation 3a: A + B + 2C = 155  \nEquation 5a: B - C = 12  \n\nNow, let's see how to solve these.\n\nFrom equation 5a: B = C + 12. Let me substitute B in other equations.\n\nLet me substitute B = C + 12 into equation 2a:\n\nEquation 2a: (C + 12) + 3C = 160  \nC +12 +3C = 160  \n4C +12 = 160  \n4C = 148  \nC = 37. Then B = 37 +12 = 49.\n\nSo now we have C=37, B=49.\n\nNow, let's use equation 3a: A + B + 2C = 155. Substitute B and C:\n\nA + 49 + 2*37 = 155  \nA + 49 +74 = 155  \nA + 123 = 155  \nA = 155 -123 = 32.\n\nSo A=32.\n\nNow, from equation 4: A + B + C + D =56. Substitute A=32, B=49, C=37:\n\n32 +49 +37 + D = 56  \n(32+49)=81, 81+37=118. So 118 + D =56 → D=56-118= -62.\n\nSo D=-62.\n\nNow, check if these values satisfy equation 1a: 4A + B - C = 140.\n\n4*32=128, B=49, C=37. 128 +49 -37 = 128 +12 = 140. Correct.\n\nAlso check equation 5a: B - C = 49 -37=12. Correct.\n\nNow let's check equation 1 original: 5A + 2B + D = 5*32 + 2*49 + (-62) = 160 +98 -62 = 196. Correct. 160+98=258-62=196. Yes.\n\nEquation 2 original: A + 2B +4C + D = 32 + 2*49 +4*37 + (-62) = 32 +98 +148 -62. Let's compute:\n\n32+98=130, 130+148=278, 278-62=216. Correct.\n\nEquation 3 original: 2A + 2B +3C + D = 2*32 + 2*49 +3*37 + (-62) = 64 +98 +111 -62. 64+98=162, +111=273, -62=211.

Each column has 5 elements (since there are 5 rows). Let me reconstruct the grid column by column.\n\nOriginal grid:\n\nRow 1: √√√?√√∂?  \nRow 2: ?√¬¬?∂¬¬  \nRow 3: √¬√¬∂?¬?  \nRow 4: ∂√?√?¬¬∂  \nRow 5: ¬??∂√∂?√  \n\nLet me list each column.

      "Okay, let's see. I need to find the column sums based on the given grid and row sums. First, I should probably figure out the numerical values of each symbol. The grid has symbols like ∞, ∈, ⇒, ∇, and maybe others. Each symbol represents a number. The rows have sums provided, so I can use those to set up equations and solve for the symbols.\n\nLet me list out the rows with their symbols and the total sum. Let me assign variables to each symbol. Let's say:\n\nLet me assign variables to each symbol. Let me check which symbols are present. The symbols are ∞, ∈, ⇒, ∇, and maybe others? Let me see:\n\nLooking at the grid:\n\nFirst row: ∞, ∈, ∞, ∈, ∈. Sum is -43.\n\nSecond row: ∈, ⇒, ∞, ∈, ⇒. Sum is 34.\n\nThird row: ∞, ∇, ∇, ⇒, ∞. Sum is -43.\n\nFourth row: ∇, ∈, ⇒, ⇒, ⇒. Sum is 45.\n\nFifth row: ∇, ∇, ∈, ∇, ⇒. Sum is -87.\n\nSixth row: ∈, ⇒, ∞, ⇒, ∈. Sum is 34.\n\nSeventh row: ∇, ⇒, ∇, ∞, ∈. Sum is -54.\n\nSo symbols are ∞, ∈, ⇒, ∇. Let me assign variables:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet a = ∞\n\nb = ∈\n\nc = ⇒\n\nd = ∇\n\nNow, each row gives an equation based on the count of symbols and their sum.\n\nLet me write equations for each row.\n\nRow 1: 2a + 3b = -43\n\nRow 2: 1b + 1c + 1a + 1b + 1c = sum? Wait, symbols are ∈, ⇒, ∞, ∈, ⇒. So that's b, c, a, b, c. So total is a + 2b + 2c = 34.\n\nRow 3: ∞, ∇, ∇, ⇒, ∞. So a, d, d, c, a. That's 2a + 2d + c = -43.\n\nRow 4: ∇, ∈, ⇒, ⇒, ⇒ → d + b + 3c = 45.\n\nRow 5: ∇, ∇, ∈, ∇, ⇒ → 3d + b + c = -87.\n\nRow 6: ∈, ⇒, ∞, ⇒, ∈ → b, c, a, c, b. So 2b + 2c + a = 34. Which is same as row 2. So that's the same equation.\n\nRow 7: ∇, ⇒, ∇, ∞, ∈ → d, c, d, a, b → a + b + 2d + c = -54.\n\nSo now we have several equations. Let me list them:\n\nEquation 1: 2a + 3b = -43\n\nEquation 2: a + 2b + 2c = 34\n\nEquation 3: 2a + c + 2d = -43\n\nEquation 4: b + d + 3c = 45\n\nEquation 5: 3d + b + c = -87\n\nEquation 7: a + b + c + 2d = -54\n\nWait, equation 7 is a + b + c + 2d = -54.\n\nHmm. Let me see. Let's see how many variables we have. Four variables: a, b, c, d. So we need four equations. Let's check if the equations are independent.\n\nEquation 1: 2a +3b = -43\n\nEquation 2: a +2b +2c = 34\n\nEquation 3: 2a + c + 2d = -43\n\nEquation 4: b + d +3c =45\n\nEquation 5: 3d +b +c = -87\n\nEquation 7: a +b +c +2d = -54.\n\nWait, equation 7 can be derived from equation 2 and equation 3? Let me check.\n\nEquation 2 is a +2b +2c = 34.\n\nEquation 3 is 2a + c + 2d = -43.\n\nIf I add equation 2 and equation 3: 3a + 2b + c + 2d = -9.\n\nBut equation 7 is a +b +c +2d = -54. Not sure if directly related. Maybe not. So perhaps we can use equations 1,2,4,5 to solve for variables.\n\nAlternatively, since there are multiple equations, let's try solving step by step.\n\nLet me start with equations 1 and 2.\n\nEquation 1: 2a +3b = -43 → Let's solve for a in terms of b.\n\nFrom equation 1: 2a = -43 -3b → a = (-43 -3b)/2.\n\nEquation 2: a +2b +2c =34. Substitute a:\n\n(-43 -3b)/2 + 2b + 2c =34.\n\nMultiply all terms by 2 to eliminate denominator:\n\n-43 -3b +4b +4c = 68 → (-43) + b +4c =68 → b +4c = 68 +43 = 111 → b = 111 -4c. Let's call this equation 2a.\n\nNow, let's take equation 5: 3d +b +c = -87. And equation 4: b +d +3c =45.\n\nSo equation 4: b +d +3c =45. Let me write equations 4 and 5 with variables.\n\nLet me express equation 4: d = 45 -b -3c.\n\nEquation 5: 3d +b +c = -87. Substitute d from equation 4 into equation 5:\n\n3*(45 -b -3c) +b +c = -87 → 135 -3b -9c +b +c = -87 → 135 -2b -8c = -87 → -2b -8c = -87 -135 = -222 → divide both sides by -2: b +4c = 111. Which is exactly equation 2a. So equations 4 and 5 are consistent with equation 2a. So no new info here. So we need more equations.\n\nNow, let's look at equation 3: 2a +c +2d = -43.\n\nWe can express a from equation 1 as (-43 -3b)/2. And d from equation 4 as 45 -b -3c. Substitute into equation 3:\n\n2*[ (-43 -3b)/2 ] +c + 2*(45 -b -3c) = -43.\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe first term: 2*(...)/2 → (-43 -3b) + c + 90 -2b -6c = -43.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-43 -3b + c +90 -2b -6c = (-43 +90) + (-3b -2b) + (c -6c) → 47 -5b -5c = -43.\n\nSo 47 -5b -5c = -43 → -5b -5c = -43 -47 = -90 → divide both sides by -5: b + c = 18. Let's call this equation 3a: b +c =18.\n\nNow, from equation 2a: b = 111 -4c. Substitute into equation 3a:\n\n(111 -4c) + c =18 → 111 -3c =18 → -3c = 18 -111 → -3c = -93 → c = 31.\n\nNow, substitute c=31 into equation 3a: b +31=18 → b=18-31= -13.\n\nNow we have c=31, b=-13.\n\nNow from equation 1: a = (-43 -3b)/2. Let's compute:\n\nb is -13 → 3b = -39. So -43 - (-39) = -43 +39 = -4. So a = -4/2 = -2. So a=-2.\n\nNow, from equation 4: d=45 -b -3c. Let's compute:\n\nb=-13, c=31. So:\n\nd=45 - (-13) -3*(31) = 45 +13 -93 = 58 -93 = -35. So d=-35.\n\nSo now we have all variables:\n\na=∞ = -2\n\nb=∈ = -13\n\nc=⇒ =31\n\nd=∇ =-35.\n\nLet me verify these values with other equations to check for consistency.\n\nCheck equation 2: a +2b +2c = -2 + 2*(-13) + 2*31 = -2 -26 +62 = 34. Which matches the given row sum of 34. Good.\n\nCheck equation 3: 2a +c +2d = 2*(-2) +31 +2*(-35) = -4 +31 -70 = (-4-70)+31= -74 +31= -43. Which matches the third row sum. Good.\n\nCheck equation 4: b +d +3c = -13 + (-35) + 3*31 = -48 +93=45. Correct.\n\nEquation 5: 3d +b +c = 3*(-35) + (-13) +31 = -105 -13 +31 = -87. Correct.\n\nEquation 7: a +b +c +2d = -2 + (-13) +31 + 2*(-35) = -15 +31 -70 = 16 -70= -54. Correct.\n\nAll equations check out. Great.\n\nNow, with the symbols' values known, we need to compute the column sums. The grid has 5 columns (since each row has 5 symbols). Let me reconstruct the grid with the symbols replaced by their numerical values, then sum each column.\n\nFirst, let me list each row's symbols and replace them with their values.\n\nOriginal grid:\n\nRow 1: ∞ ∈ ∞ ∈ ∈ → a, b, a, b, b → -2, -13, -2, -13, -13\n\nRow 2: ∈ ⇒ ∞ ∈ ⇒ → b, c, a, b, c → -13, 31, -2, -13, 31\n\nRow 3: ∞ ∇ ∇ ⇒ ∞ → a, d, d, c, a → -2, -35, -35, 31, -2\n\nRow 4: ∇ ∈ ⇒ ⇒ ⇒ → d, b, c, c, c → -35, -13, 31, 31, 31\n\nRow 5: ∇ ∇ ∈ ∇ ⇒ → d, d, b, d, c → -35, -35, -13, -35, 31\n\nRow 6: ∈ ⇒ ∞ ⇒ ∈ → b, c, a, c, b → -13, 31, -2, 31, -13\n\nRow 7: ∇ ⇒ ∇ ∞ ∈ → d, c, d, a, b → -35, 31, -35, -2, -13\n\nNow, for each column (columns 1 to 5), sum the values.\n\nLet me create a table of each row's values and then sum columns.\n\nLet me write each row's values as a list:\n\nRow 1: [-2, -13, -2, -13, -13]\n\nRow 2: [-13, 31, -2, -13, 31]\n\nRow 3: [-2, -35, -35, 31, -2]\n\nRow 4: [-35, -13, 31, 31, 31]\n\nRow 5: [-35, -35, -13, -35, 31]\n\nRow 6: [-13, 31, -2, 31, -13]\n\nRow 7: [-35, 31, -35, -2, -13]\n\nNow, let's list each column's elements:\n\nColumn 1: elements from each row's first position:\n\nRow1: -2\n\nRow2: -13\n\nRow3: -2\n\nRow4: -35\n\nRow5: -35\n\nRow6: -13\n\nRow7: -35\n\nSum column 1: (-2) + (-13) + (-2) + (-35) + (-35) + (-13) + (-35)\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nStart with 0.\n\nAdd -2 → -2\n\nAdd -13 → -15\n\nAdd -2 → -17\n\nAdd -35 → -52\n\nAdd -35 → -87\n\nAdd -13 → -100\n\nAdd -35 → -135. So column1 sum is -135.\n\nColumn 2: elements from each row's second position:\n\nRow1: -13\n\nRow2: 31\n\nRow3: -35\n\nRow4: -13\n\nRow5: -35\n\nRow6: 31\n\nRow7: 31\n\nSum column2:\n\n-13 +31 + (-35) + (-13) + (-35) +31 +31\n\nLet me compute:\n\nStart with 0.\n\n-13 +31 = 18\n\n18 -35 = -17\n\n-17 -13 = -30\n\n-30 -35 = -65\n\n-65 +31 = -34\n\n-34 +31 = 0. Wait, that seems interesting. Let me check again.\n\nRow1: -13\n\nRow2: +31 → total so far 18\n\nRow3: -35 → 18-35=-17\n\nRow4: -13 → -17-13=-30\n\nRow5: -35 → -30-35=-65\n\nRow6: +31 → -65+31=-34\n\nRow7: +31 → -34+31=-3.

So column2 sum is -3.\n\nColumn3: elements from third position:\n\nRow1: -2\n\nRow2: -2\n\nRow3: -35\n\nRow4: 31\n\nRow5: -13\n\nRow6: -2\n\nRow7: -35\n\nSum column3:\n\n-2 + (-2) + (-35) +31 + (-13) + (-2) + (-35)\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nStart with 0.\n\n-2 → -2\n\n-2 → -4\n\n-35 → -39\n\n+31 → -8\n\n-13 → -21\n\n-2 → -23\n\n-35 → -58. So column3 sum is -58.\n\nColumn4: elements from fourth position:\n\nRow1: -13\n\nRow2: -13\n\nRow3: 31\n\nRow4: 31\n\nRow5: -35\n\nRow6: 31\n\nRow7: -2\n\nSum column4:\n\n-13 + (-13) +31 +31 + (-35) +31 + (-2)\n\nCompute step by step:\n\nStart with 0.\n\n-13 → -13\n\n-13 → -26\n\n+31 → 5\n\n+31 → 36\n\n-35 → 1\n\n+31 → 32\n\n-2 → 30.

So column5 sum is 52.\n\nSo compiling the column sums: column1=-135, column2=-3, column3=-58, column4=30, column5=52. Therefore the answer should be the list [-135, -3, -58, 30, 52].\n\nLet me verify once more to avoid calculation errors.\n\nFor column 1:\n\n-2 (row1), -13 (row2), -2 (row3), -35 (row4), -35 (row5), -13 (row6), -35 (row7).

Let me check the length of each row.\n\nRow 1 has 7 symbols. Let me check others:\n\nRow 2: 7 symbols. Row 3: 7. Row 4: 7. Row 5: 7. So the grid is 5 rows by 7 columns.\n\nSo there are 7 columns. Each column's sum is the sum of each row's symbol in that column.\n\nBut to compute that, I need to know the value of each symbol. Let me denote each symbol as variables. Let me assign variables:\n\nLet me assign:\n\n∩ = A\n\n≠ = B\n\n/ = C\n\n♣ = D\n\nSo each symbol is a variable. Now, I need to create equations based on each row.\n\nRow 1: A + B + C + D + A + C + B = 40\n\nSimplify: 2A + 2B + C + D + C → Wait, let me recount:\n\nRow 1 symbols are ∩, ≠, /, ♣, ∩, /, ≠. So positions:\n\n1. A (A)\n2. B (B)\n3. C (C)\n4. D (D)\n5. A (A)\n6. C (C)\n7. B (B)\n\nSo total for row 1 is A + B + C + D + A + C + B = 2A + 2B + 2C + D = 40. Wait:\n\nWait, adding up:\n\nA (1) + B (2) + C (3) + D (4) + A (5) + C (6) + B (7) → A + A = 2A, B + B = 2B, C + C = 2C, and D once. So equation is 2A + 2B + 2C + D = 40. Let me note that as equation (1).\n\nRow 2: symbols are ≠, ♣, ∩, /, /, ∩, ♣ → B, D, A, C, C, A, D. So sum is B + D + A + C + C + A + D = 2A + B + 2C + 2D = 202. Equation (2).\n\nRow 3: symbols are ♣, ≠, ≠, ≠, ♣, ∩, ♣ → D, B, B, B, D, A, D. Sum is D + 3B + D + A + D → 3B + A + 3D. So equation (3): A + 3B + 3D = -1.\n\nRow 4: symbols are /, ∩, ≠, ≠, /, ♣, / → C, A, B, B, C, D, C. Sum: C + A + 2B + C + D + C → A + 2B + 3C + D = 29. Equation (4).\n\nRow 5: symbols are ≠, ≠, ♣, ♣, ♣, ♣, ≠ → B, B, D, D, D, D, B. Sum: 3B + 4D = 32. Equation (5).\n\nNow, we have five equations:\n\n(1) 2A + 2B + 2C + D = 40\n\n(2) 2A + B + 2C + 2D = 202\n\n(3) A + 3B + 3D = -1\n\n(4) A + 2B + 3C + D = 29\n\n(5) 3B + 4D = 32\n\nOur variables are A, B, C, D. Let me see if I can solve these equations.\n\nLet me start with equation (5): 3B + 4D = 32. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of another. For example, solve for B:\n\n3B = 32 -4D → B = (32 -4D)/3. Hmm. But fractions might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I can find integer solutions here. Let's see if there are integer values for B and D that satisfy this equation. Let me think possible D values.\n\nLet me check equation (3): A + 3B + 3D = -1. If I can find B and D from equation (5), perhaps I can substitute into equation (3) to find A, then use other equations to find C.\n\nBut let me proceed step by step.\n\nEquation (5): 3B +4D =32.\n\nLet me note that equation (3) is A +3B +3D = -1. Let me subtract equation (5) multiplied by something. Wait, equation (3) has 3B +3D. Equation (5) is 3B +4D =32. Let me subtract equation (3) from equation (5):\n\n(3B +4D) - (A +3B +3D) = 32 - (-1) → ?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Equation (5) is 3B +4D =32. Equation (3) is A +3B +3D = -1. Let me rearrange equation (3) to express A in terms of B and D:\n\nA = -1 -3B -3D.\n\nBut maybe I can use equation (5) to express one variable in terms of another and substitute into others.\n\nLet me try to find B and D first.\n\nEquation (5): 3B +4D =32.\n\nLet me also look at equation (3) and (others). Let me check if there's another equation involving B and D. For example, equation (1) has 2A + 2B + 2C + D =40. But that also includes A and C. Maybe not helpful yet.\n\nLet me see if I can find another equation involving B and D. Let me check equations (1) and (2). Let me subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate some variables.\n\nEquation (2): 2A + B + 2C + 2D = 202\n\nEquation (1): 2A + 2B + 2C + D =40\n\nSubtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n\n(2A -2A) + (B -2B) + (2C -2C) + (2D - D) = 202 -40 → -B + D = 162 → D - B = 162 → D = B +162.\n\nSo equation (6): D = B +162.\n\nNow substitute equation (6) into equation (5): 3B +4D =32.\n\nReplace D with B+162:\n\n3B +4*(B+162) =32 → 3B +4B + 648 =32 → 7B +648 =32 → 7B = 32-648 = -616 → B = -616 /7 = -88.\n\nSo B is -88. Then D = B +162 = -88 +162 = 74.\n\nSo B = -88, D=74.\n\nNow, let's use equation (3) to find A.\n\nEquation (3): A +3B +3D =-1.\n\nSubstitute B=-88 and D=74:\n\nA +3*(-88) +3*(74) = -1 → A -264 +222 = -1 → A -42 = -1 → A = 41.\n\nSo A=41.\n\nNow we have A=41, B=-88, D=74. Now we need to find C.\n\nLet me use equation (4): A + 2B + 3C + D =29.\n\nSubstitute A=41, B=-88, D=74:\n\n41 + 2*(-88) +3C +74 =29 → 41 -176 +74 +3C =29 → (41+74) =115; 115-176 = -61. So -61 +3C =29 → 3C=29+61=90 → C=30.\n\nSo C=30.\n\nNow we have all variables:\n\nA=41 (∩), B=-88 (≠), C=30 (/), D=74 (♣).\n\nNow, with these values, we can compute each column's sum.\n\nThe grid has 7 columns. Let's process each column by looking at each row's symbol in that column and summing their values.\n\nLet me list each column's symbols row by row.\n\nFirst, let me write out the grid again, column by column.\n\nOriginal grid rows:\n\nRow 1: ∩ ≠ / ♣ ∩ / ≠ → Columns 1-7:\n\nC1: ∩\n\nC2: ≠\n\nC3: /\n\nC4: ♣\n\nC5: ∩\n\nC6: /\n\nC7: ≠\n\nRow 2: ≠ ♣ ∩ / / ∩ ♣ → C1: ≠, C2: ♣, C3: ∩, C4: /, C5: /, C6: ∩, C7: ♣\n\nRow3: ♣ ≠ ≠ ≠ ♣ ∩ ♣ → C1: ♣, C2: ≠, C3: ≠, C4: ≠, C5: ♣, C6: ∩, C7: ♣\n\nRow4: / ∩ ≠ ≠ / ♣ / → C1: /, C2: ∩, C3: ≠, C4: ≠, C5: /, C6: ♣, C7: /\n\nRow5: ≠ ≠ ♣ ♣ ♣ ♣ ≠ → C1: ≠, C2: ≠, C3: ♣, C4: ♣, C5: ♣, C6: ♣, C7: ≠\n\nNow for each column (from 1 to 7), collect the symbols from each row and compute their sum.\n\nLet me process column by column.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow1: ∩ (A=41)\n\nRow2: ≠ (B=-88)\n\nRow3: ♣ (D=74)\n\nRow4: / (C=30)\n\nRow5: ≠ (B=-88)\n\nSum: 41 + (-88) +74 +30 + (-88) = Let's compute step by step:\n\nStart with 41 -88 = -47; -47 +74=27; 27+30=57; 57-88= -31.\n\nSo column1 sum is -31.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow1: ≠ (B=-88)\n\nRow2: ♣ (D=74)\n\nRow3: ≠ (B=-88)\n\nRow4: ∩ (A=41)\n\nRow5: ≠ (B=-88)\n\nSum: -88 +74 + (-88) +41 + (-88) = Let's compute:\n\nStart with -88 +74 = -14; -14 -88 = -102; -102 +41 = -61; -61 -88 = -149.\n\nSo column2 sum is -149.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow1: / (C=30)\n\nRow2: ∩ (A=41)\n\nRow3: ≠ (B=-88)\n\nRow4: ≠ (B=-88)\n\nRow5: ♣ (D=74)\n\nSum: 30 +41 + (-88) + (-88) +74.\n\nCompute:\n\n30+41=71; 71-88= -17; -17-88= -105; -105+74= -31.\n\nColumn3 sum is -31.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow1: ♣ (D=74)\n\nRow2: / (C=30)\n\nRow3: ≠ (B=-88)\n\nRow4: ≠ (B=-88)\n\nRow5: ♣ (D=74)\n\nSum: 74 +30 + (-88) + (-88) +74.\n\nCompute:\n\n74+30=104; 104-88=16; 16-88= -72; -72+74=2.\n\nColumn4 sum is 2.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow1: ∩ (A=41)\n\nRow2: / (C=30)\n\nRow3: ♣ (D=74)\n\nRow4: / (C=30)\n\nRow5: ♣ (D=74)\n\nSum: 41 +30 +74 +30 +74.\n\nCompute:\n\n41+30=71; 71+74=145; 145+30=175; 175+74=249.\n\nColumn5 sum is 249.\n\nColumn6:\n\nRow1: / (C=30)\n\nRow2: ∩ (A=41)\n\nRow3: ∩ (A=41)\n\nRow4: ♣ (D=74)\n\nRow5: ♣ (D=74)\n\nSum: 30 +41 +41 +74 +74.\n\nCompute:\n\n30+41=71; 71+41=112; 112+74=186; 186+74=260.\n\nColumn6 sum is 260.\n\nColumn7:\n\nRow1: ≠ (B=-88)\n\nRow2: ♣ (D=74)\n\nRow3: ♣ (D=74)\n\nRow4: / (C=30)\n\nRow5: ≠ (B=-88)\n\nSum: -88 +74 +74 +30 + (-88).\n\nCompute:\n\nStart with -88 +74 = -14; -14 +74=60; 60+30=90; 90-88=2.\n\nColumn7 sum is 2.\n\nSo compiling all column sums:\n\nColumn1: -31\n\nColumn2: -149\n\nColumn3: -31\n\nColumn4: 2\n\nColumn5: 249\n\nColumn6: 260\n\nColumn7: 2\n\nTherefore, the answer should be the list of these sums in order: [-31, -149, -31, 2, 249, 260, 2].\n\nLet me verify if these numbers make sense.

      "Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the task is to compute the sum of each column in a grid where each symbol represents a numerical value. We're given the sum of each row, which probably will help us determine the individual symbol values first. Once we know the values of each symbol, we can then calculate the column sums.\n\nFirst, let me list out the grid and the row sums. The grid has 7 rows and each row seems to have 8 symbols (since each line after the symbols has a number, which I assume is the row sum). Let me confirm that. Let me count the symbols in each row:\n\nLooking at the first line: \"-@@←≥←∆- -505\". The symbols before the space and the number are \"-@@←≥←∆-\", which is 8 symbols. Similarly, the second line is \"@∆∆@≈←≥≈ -346\" which is also 8 symbols. So each row has 8 symbols, and each column is thus 7 entries (since there are 7 rows). Wait, no, the number of columns is 8, since each row has 8 symbols. The grid is 7 rows by 8 columns. So we need to compute the sum of each of the 8 columns.\n\nBut first, we need to assign numerical values to each symbol. Let me note down all the unique symbols. The symbols I can see are: -, @, ←, ≥, ∆, ≈. Let me check each row:\n\nFirst row: -, @, @, ←, ≥, ←, ∆, -\nSecond row: @, ∆, ∆, @, ≈, ←, ≥, ≈\nThird row: ∆, @, ←, ←, ∆, -, -, -\nFourth row: @, -, ←, ≈, ←, ←, -, -\nFifth row: ≈, @, @, ≥, @, ≥, @, @\nSixth row: ≥, @, @, -, ≥, @, ←, ≈\nSeventh row: -, ∆, -, ∆, @, ←, ∆, ≈\n\nSo the symbols are: -, @, ←, ≥, ∆, ≈. Let me count them. That's six different symbols. Let me assign variables to each symbol. Let me denote:\n\nLet’s define variables as:\n- Let’s say:\n- A = -\n- B = @\n- C = ←\n- D = ≥\n- E = ∆\n- F = ≈\n\nSo each symbol corresponds to a variable. Now, each row's sum is given, so we can set up equations for each row. Since each row has 8 symbols, each equation will be the sum of their corresponding variables equal to the given row sum.\n\nFor example, the first row: A, B, B, C, D, C, E, A. The sum is A + B + B + C + D + C + E + A = 2A + 2B + 2C + D + E = -505.\n\nSimilarly, for each row, we can create such equations. Let me write them all down.\n\nRow 1: 2A + 2B + 2C + D + E = -505\nRow 2: B + 2E + B + D + F + C + D + F = Let me parse the symbols again. The second row is @∆∆@≈←≥≈. So symbols are B, E, E, B, F, C, D, F. So sum is B + E + E + B + F + C + D + F = 2B + 2E + 2F + C + D = -346.\n\nRow 3: ∆, @, ←, ←, ∆, -, -, -. So symbols are E, B, C, C, E, A, A, A. Sum: E + B + 2C + E + 3A = 2A*3? Wait, symbols are E, B, C, C, E, A, A, A. So sum is E + B + 2C + E + 3A = 2E + B + 2C + 3A = -482.\n\nRow 4: @, -, ←, ≈, ←, ←, -, -. Symbols: B, A, C, F, C, C, A, A. Sum: B + A + C + F + C + C + A + A = B + 3A + 3C + F = -681.\n\nRow 5: ≈, @, @, ≥, @, ≥, @, @. Symbols: F, B, B, D, B, D, B, B. Sum: F + 2B (from first two) + D + B + D + 2B (last two). Let me count: F, B, B, D, B, D, B, B. So total B's: 2B + B + B + B? Wait:\n\nF + (B + B + B + B + B) + (D + D). Wait, let me count each symbol:\n\nF appears once.\n\nB appears at positions 2,3,5,7,8. That's five B's? Wait, the symbols are F, B, B, D, B, D, B, B. So B is in positions 2,3,5,7,8. So five B's. D is in positions 4 and 6. So two D's. And F once. So sum is 5B + 2D + F = -477.\n\nRow 6: ≥, @, @, -, ≥, @, ←, ≈. Symbols: D, B, B, A, D, B, C, F. Sum: D + 2B + A + D + B + C + F = 3B + 2D + A + C + F = -517.\n\nRow 7: -, ∆, -, ∆, @, ←, ∆, ≈. Symbols: A, E, A, E, B, C, E, F. Sum: A + E + A + E + B + C + E + F = 2A + 3E + B + C + F = -350.\n\nSo now, we have 7 equations with 6 variables. Wait, variables are A, B, C, D, E, F. So six variables. But seven equations. Let me check if there's a mistake in the equations.\n\nLet me re-express each equation:\n\nEquation 1: 2A + 2B + 2C + D + E = -505.\n\nEquation 2: 2B + 2E + 2F + C + D = -346.\n\nEquation 3: 3A + B + 2C + 2E = -482.\n\nEquation 4: 3A + B + 3C + F = -681.\n\nEquation 5: 5B + 2D + F = -477.\n\nEquation 6: 3B + 2D + A + C + F = -517.\n\nEquation 7: 2A + B + C + 3E + F = -350.\n\nWait, equation 7 comes from row 7's symbols: A, E, A, E, B, C, E, F. So sum is A + E + A + E + B + C + E + F = 2A + B + C + 3E + F. Yes.\n\nSo now we have 7 equations with 6 variables. This might be overdetermined, but perhaps there's a solution. Let me try solving these equations step by step.\n\nFirst, let me list all equations again:\n\n1. 2A + 2B + 2C + D + E = -505. (Equation 1)\n2. 2B + 2E + 2F + C + D = -346. (Equation 2)\n3. 3A + B + 2C + 2E = -482. (Equation 3)\n4. 3A + B + 3C + F = -681. (Equation 4)\n5. 5B + 2D + F = -477. (Equation 5)\n6. 3B + 2D + A + C + F = -517. (Equation 6)\n7. 2A + B + C + 3E + F = -350. (Equation 7)\n\nWe need to find A, B, C, D, E, F.\n\nLet me see if I can express some variables in terms of others. Let me start with equations that have fewer variables.\n\nLooking at equation 3: 3A + B + 2C + 2E = -482. (Equation 3)\n\nEquation 7: 2A + B + C + 3E + F = -350. (Equation 7)\n\nEquation 4: 3A + B + 3C + F = -681. (Equation 4)\n\nEquation 5: 5B + 2D + F = -477. (Equation 5)\n\nEquation 6: 3B + 2D + A + C + F = -517. (Equation 6)\n\nEquation 1: 2A + 2B + 2C + D + E = -505. (Equation 1)\n\nEquation 2: 2B + 2E + 2F + C + D = -346. (Equation 2)\n\nLet me try to express variables step by step.\n\nFirst, perhaps we can find relations between equations. For example, equations 5 and 6 both involve 2D and F. Let me subtract them or find a relation.\n\nEquation 6: 3B + 2D + A + C + F = -517.\n\nEquation 5: 5B + 2D + F = -477.\n\nIf we subtract equation 5 from equation 6, we get:\n\n(3B + 2D + A + C + F) - (5B + 2D + F) = -517 - (-477)\n\nSimplify:\n\n3B -5B + A + C = -517 +477 → -2B + A + C = -40 → A + C - 2B = -40. Let's call this equation 8.\n\nEquation 8: A + C - 2B = -40.\n\nNow, equation 3 is 3A + B + 2C + 2E = -482. Let me see if I can find another equation involving E.\n\nEquation 1: 2A + 2B + 2C + D + E = -505. Let me note that equation 1 has D and E.\n\nEquation 2: 2B + 2E + 2F + C + D = -346. Also has D, E, F.\n\nEquation 7: 2A + B + C + 3E + F = -350. Also has E and F.\n\nEquation 4: 3A + B + 3C + F = -681. Has F.\n\nEquation 5: 5B + 2D + F = -477. Has D and F.\n\nEquation 6 is already used.\n\nEquation 8: A + C - 2B = -40.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Maybe express variables step by step.\n\nLet me try to find expressions for F from equations 4 and 7.\n\nEquation 4: 3A + B + 3C + F = -681 → F = -681 -3A -B -3C. (Equation 4a)\n\nEquation 7: 2A + B + C + 3E + F = -350 → F = -350 -2A -B -C -3E. (Equation 7a)\n\nSet equations 4a and 7a equal:\n\n-681 -3A -B -3C = -350 -2A -B -C -3E\n\nSimplify:\n\n-681 -3A -B -3C + 350 +2A +B +C +3E = 0 → (-331) -A -2C +3E = 0 → 3E = A + 2C + 331 → E = (A + 2C + 331)/3. (Equation 9)\n\nNow, equation 3 is 3A + B + 2C + 2E = -482. Let's substitute E from equation 9.\n\nSubstitute E:\n\n3A + B + 2C + 2*(A + 2C + 331)/3 = -482.\n\nMultiply both sides by 3 to eliminate denominators:\n\n3*(3A) + 3B + 3*(2C) + 2*(A + 2C + 331) = 3*(-482)\n\n→ 9A + 3B + 6C + 2A +4C + 662 = -1446\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(9A + 2A) + 3B + (6C +4C) + 662 = -1446 → 11A + 3B + 10C + 662 = -1446 → 11A + 3B + 10C = -1446 -662 = -2108. Let's call this equation 10.\n\nEquation 10: 11A + 3B + 10C = -2108.\n\nNow, equation 8 is A + C - 2B = -40. Let's write equation 8 as A + C = 2B -40. (Equation 8a)\n\nSo, equation 8a: A + C = 2B -40.\n\nNow, equation 10 is 11A + 3B + 10C = -2108. Let me see if I can express this in terms of equation 8a.\n\nLet me note that A + C = 2B -40. Let me express A as 2B -40 - C. Wait, but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps express 11A + 10C in terms of equation 8a.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express equation 10 as:\n\n11A + 10C + 3B = -2108.\n\nBut since A + C = 2B -40, perhaps multiply equation 8a by some factor to get 11A + 10C.\n\nLet me see:\n\nLet me think of 11A + 10C as a combination of A + C and some other terms.\n\nAlternatively, let me express A from equation 8a: A = 2B -40 - C. Substitute this into equation 10.\n\nEquation 10: 11*(2B -40 - C) + 3B + 10C = -2108.\n\nCalculate:\n\n22B - 440 -11C + 3B +10C = -2108 → 25B - C -440 = -2108 → 25B - C = -2108 + 440 = -1668 → 25B - C = -1668. Let's call this equation 11.\n\nEquation 11: 25B - C = -1668 → C = 25B + 1668. (Equation 11a)\n\nNow, we can substitute C into equation 8a: A + C = 2B -40 → A = 2B -40 - C.\n\nSubstituting C from equation 11a: A = 2B -40 - (25B + 1668) = 2B -40 -25B -1668 = -23B - 1708. (Equation 12)\n\nSo now, we have expressions for A and C in terms of B. Let me note:\n\nA = -23B -1708 (Equation 12)\n\nC = 25B + 1668 (Equation 11a)\n\nNow, let's move to equation 4a: F = -681 -3A -B -3C.\n\nSubstituting A and C from equations 12 and 11a:\n\nF = -681 -3*(-23B -1708) - B -3*(25B +1668)\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n-3*(-23B -1708) = 69B + 5124\n\n-3*(25B +1668) = -75B -5004\n\nSo F = -681 + 69B +5124 - B -75B -5004\n\nCombine terms:\n\n69B - B -75B = (69 -1 -75)B = (-7B)\n\nConstants: -681 +5124 -5004 = (-681) + (5124 -5004) = -681 + 120 = -561\n\nSo F = -7B -561. (Equation 13)\n\nNow, equation 9 gives E in terms of A and C. Let's use equation 9:\n\nE = (A + 2C + 331)/3.\n\nSubstituting A and C from equations 12 and 11a:\n\nA + 2C = (-23B -1708) + 2*(25B +1668) = -23B -1708 +50B +3336 = 27B + 1628.\n\nSo E = (27B + 1628 + 331)/3 = (27B + 1959)/3 = 9B + 653. (Equation 14)\n\nNow, we have E expressed in terms of B.\n\nNow, let's look at equation 5: 5B + 2D + F = -477. We can express D in terms of B and F.\n\nBut we already have F in terms of B (equation 13). Let's substitute F into equation 5.\n\nEquation 5: 5B + 2D + F = -477 → 5B + 2D + (-7B -561) = -477 → -2B + 2D -561 = -477 → -2B + 2D = -477 +561 = 84 → 2D = 2B +84 → D = B +42. (Equation 15)\n\nNow, D is expressed in terms of B.\n\nNow, let's move to equation 1: 2A + 2B + 2C + D + E = -505.\n\nWe can substitute A, C, D, E in terms of B.\n\nLet's compute each term:\n\n2A = 2*(-23B -1708) = -46B -3416\n\n2B = 2B\n\n2C = 2*(25B +1668) = 50B + 3336\n\nD = B +42\n\nE = 9B +653\n\nAdding all together:\n\n(-46B -3416) + 2B + (50B +3336) + (B +42) + (9B +653) = ?\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nB terms: -46B +2B +50B +B +9B = (-46 + 2 +50 +1 +9)B = (16)B\n\nConstants: -3416 +3336 +42 +653 = Let's calculate:\n\n-3416 + 3336 = -80\n\n-80 +42 = -38\n\n-38 +653 = 615.\n\nSo equation 1 becomes: 16B + 615 = -505 → 16B = -505 -615 = -1120 → B = -1120 /16 = -70.\n\nSo B = -70.\n\nNow that we have B, we can find other variables.\n\nFrom equation 15: D = B +42 → D = -70 +42 = -28.\n\nFrom equation 11a: C = 25B +1668 → 25*(-70) +1668 = -1750 +1668 = -82.\n\nFrom equation 12: A = -23B -1708 → -23*(-70) -1708 = 1610 -1708 = -98.\n\nFrom equation 13: F = -7B -561 → -7*(-70) -561 = 490 -561 = -71.\n\nFrom equation 14: E = 9B +653 → 9*(-70) +653 = -630 +653 = 23.\n\nSo now we have all variables:\n\nA = -98 (symbol '-')\n\nB = -70 (@)\n\nC = -82 (←)\n\nD = -28 (≥)\n\nE = 23 (∆)\n\nF = -71 (≈)\n\nLet me check if these values satisfy all the equations.\n\nLet me check equation 3: 3A + B + 2C + 2E = ?\n\n3*(-98) + (-70) + 2*(-82) + 2*(23) = -294 -70 -164 +46 = (-294-70) = -364; -364 -164 = -528; -528 +46 = -482. Which matches equation 3's value of -482. Good.\n\nEquation 4: 3A + B + 3C + F = ?\n\n3*(-98) + (-70) +3*(-82) + (-71) = -294 -70 -246 -71 = (-294-70)= -364; -364 -246= -610; -610 -71= -681.

Let's add: -210-56= -266; -266-98= -364; -364-82= -446; -446-71= -517. Correct.\n\nEquation 7: 2A + B + C + 3E + F = 2*(-98) + (-70) + (-82) + 3*(23) + (-71) = -196 -70 -82 +69 -71.

      "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the column sums based on the given grid and row sums. The grid has symbols, each representing a numerical value. The rows are given with their total sums, and I need to compute the column sums. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure. The grid is 8 rows by 9 columns (since each row has 9 symbols). Each symbol is a unique character, like ∵, ↑, ⊥, etc. Each of these symbols has a fixed value. The challenge is to find out the value of each symbol first, and then compute the column sums.\n\nBut wait, how do I find the value of each symbol? Since there are 8 rows and each row's sum is provided, maybe I can set up a system of equations. Let me think: Each row is a combination of symbols, and their sum equals the given row total. If I can assign variables to each symbol, then solve the equations, I can find the value for each symbol. Once I have those, I can compute each column's sum by adding up the corresponding symbols' values.\n\nLet me list out the symbols first. Let me check all the symbols present in the grid. Let me go through each row:\n\nFirst row: ∵, ↑, ⊥, ¬, √, ↑, ¬, √, ⊥ → symbols are ∵, ↑, ⊥, ¬, √.\n\nSecond row: ¬, ∫, ∵, ↑, √, ∵, ⊥, ∑, ↑ → adds ∫ and ∑.\n\nThird row: ∑, ∑, √, ∵, ⊥, ¬, ∵, ⊥, ↑ → same symbols.\n\nFourth row: ∫, ↑, ∵, ∵, ∑, ¬, ∵, ∑, √ → same symbols.\n\nFifth row: ¬, √, ∑, √, ⊥, ∑, ¬, ∵, ∑ → same symbols.\n\nSixth row: ∫, ∵, √, ⊥, √, ∫, ∫, ⊥, ↑ → adds ∫ again.\n\nSeventh row: √, ⊥, √, ⊥, ∵, ⊥, ↑, ↑, ∫ → same symbols.\n\nEighth row: ⊥, ∑, ↑, √, ∵, √, ∫, ∫, ↑ → same symbols.\n\nSo the symbols present are: ∵, ↑, ⊥, ¬, √, ∫, ∑. That's 7 symbols. Let me count again to make sure. Let me check each row:\n\nFirst row: 5 symbols.\n\nSecond row: introduces ∫ and ∑. So total 7 symbols. Let me confirm:\n\nSymbols list: ∵, ↑, ⊥, ¬, √, ∫, ∑. Yes, seven unique symbols. Let me assign variables to each symbol. Let me denote them as:\n\nLet’s assign variables:\n\nLet’s say:\n\nA = ∵\n\nB = ↑\n\nC = ⊥\n\nD = ¬\n\nE = √\n\nF = ∫\n\nG = ∑\n\nNow, each row can be expressed as an equation based on the count of each symbol and their variables. Let me go through each row and write equations.\n\nRow 1: [∵, ↑, ⊥, ¬, √, ↑, ¬, √, ⊥] sum to -100.\n\nBreaking down counts:\n\nA (1), B (2), C (2), D (2), E (2). Wait, let's count each symbol in the first row:\n\nFirst row: symbols are:\n\n1. ∵ → A: 1\n\n2. ↑ → B: 1\n\n3. ⊥ → C: 1\n\n4. ¬ → D: 1\n\n5. √ → E: 1\n\n6. ↑ → B: 2\n\n7. ¬ → D: 2\n\n8. √ → E: 2\n\n9. ⊥ → C: 2\n\nWait, the first row is 9 symbols. Let me recount:\n\nFirst row symbols:\n\n1. ∵ (A)\n\n2. ↑ (B)\n\n3. ⊥ (C)\n\n4. ¬ (D)\n\n5. √ (E)\n\n6. ↑ (B) → so B count is 2\n\n7. ¬ (D) → D is 2\n\n8. √ (E) → E is 2\n\n9. ⊥ (C) → C is 2\n\nSo total counts for row 1: A:1, B:2, C:2, D:2, E:2. Sum is A + 2B + 2C + 2D + 2E = -100.\n\nSimilarly, let's process each row.\n\nRow 2: ¬, ∫, ∵, ↑, √, ∵, ⊥, ∑, ↑ → symbols:\n\nD (1), F (1), A (1), B (1), E (1), A (2), C (1), G (1), B (2). Let me count each symbol:\n\nD:1, F:1, A:2 (positions 3 and 6), B:2 (positions 2 and 9?), wait original symbols:\n\nRow 2: symbols are:\n\n1. ¬ → D\n\n2. ∫ → F\n\n3. ∵ → A\n\n4. ↑ → B\n\n5. √ → E\n\n6. ∵ → A\n\n7. ⊥ → C\n\n8. ∑ → G\n\n9. ↑ → B\n\nSo counts:\n\nA:2, B:2, C:1, D:1, E:1, F:1, G:1.\n\nSo equation: 2A + 2B + C + D + E + F + G = 4 (since row sum is 4).\n\nRow 3: ∑, ∑, √, ∵, ⊥, ¬, ∵, ⊥, ↑ → symbols:\n\nG (2), E (1), A (2), C (2), D (1), B (1).

Let me write all equations:\n\nEquation 1: A + 2B + 2C + 2D + 2E = -100\n\nEquation 2: 2A + 2B + C + D + E + F + G = 4\n\nEquation 3: 2A + B + 2C + D + E + 2G = 128 ?\n\nWait, let me re-express each equation correctly.\n\nWait, Equation 3: 2G + E + 2A + 2C + D + B = 128 → 2A + B + 2C + D + E + 2G = 128.\n\nEquation 4: F + B + 3A + 2G + D + E = 189 → 3A + B + D + E + F + 2G = 189.\n\nEquation 5: 2D + 2E + 3G + C + A = 311 → A + C + 2D + 2E + 3G = 311.\n\nEquation 6: 3F + A + 2E + 2C + B = -265 → A + B + 2C + 2E + 3F = -265.\n\nEquation 7: 2E + 3C + A + 2B + F = -321 → A + 2B + 3C + 2E + F = -321.\n\nEquation 8: C + G + 2B + 2E + A + 2F = -177 → A + 2B + C + 2E + G + 2F = -177.\n\nSo the system of equations is:\n\n1) A + 2B + 2C + 2D + 2E = -100\n\n2) 2A + 2B + C + D + E + F + G = 4\n\n3) 2A + B + 2C + D + E + 2G = 128\n\n4) 3A + B + D + E + F + 2G = 189\n\n5) A + C + 2D + 2E + 3G = 311\n\n6) A + B + 2C + 2E + 3F = -265\n\n7) A + 2B + 3C + 2E + F = -321\n\n8) A + 2B + C + 2E + G + 2F = -177\n\nNow, we have 8 equations and 7 variables. Since there are 8 equations, there might be redundancy or inconsistency. Let me try to solve this system step by step.\n\nFirst, perhaps we can express variables in terms of others. Let me see if I can find substitutions.\n\nLet me note that equations 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 involve G, F, etc. Let me see if I can eliminate variables.\n\nLet me start by looking for equations that can be subtracted or combined.\n\nEquation 2 and 3:\n\nEquation 2: 2A + 2B + C + D + E + F + G = 4\n\nEquation 3: 2A + B + 2C + D + E + 2G = 128\n\nSubtract equation 2 from equation 3:\n\n(2A - 2A) + (B - 2B) + (2C - C) + (D - D) + (E - E) + (2G - G) + (0 - F) = 128 - 4\n\nWhich is:\n\n- B + C + G - F = 124 → -B + C + G - F = 124 → Let's call this equation 2-3: -B + C + G - F = 124.\n\nEquation 2-3: -B + C + G - F = 124.\n\nEquation 4: 3A + B + D + E + F + 2G = 189.\n\nEquation 2: 2A + 2B + C + D + E + F + G = 4.\n\nIf I subtract equation 2 from equation 4:\n\n(3A - 2A) + (B - 2B) + (D - D) + (E - E) + (F - F) + (2G - G) + (0 - C) = 189 -4\n\nWhich is:\n\nA - B + G - C = 185 → A - B - C + G = 185 → equation 4-2: A - B - C + G = 185.\n\nNow, equation 2-3 and 4-2:\n\nEquation 2-3: -B + C + G - F = 124.\n\nEquation 4-2: A - B - C + G = 185.\n\nLet me see if I can express A in terms of others from equation 4-2.\n\nFrom equation 4-2: A = 185 + B + C - G.\n\nLet me note that.\n\nNow, let's look at equation 5: A + C + 2D + 2E + 3G = 311.\n\nBut equation 1 is: A + 2B + 2C + 2D + 2E = -100.\n\nLet me subtract equation 1 from equation 5:\n\n(A - A) + (C - 2B - 2C) + (2D - 2D) + (2E - 2E) + (3G) - 0 = 311 - (-100)\n\nWait:\n\nEquation 5 minus equation 1:\n\n(A + C + 2D + 2E + 3G) - (A + 2B + 2C + 2D + 2E) = 311 - (-100)\n\nSimplify:\n\nA - A + C - 2B - 2C + 2D - 2D + 2E - 2E + 3G = 411\n\nWhich is:\n\n-2B - C + 3G = 411 → -2B - C + 3G = 411. Let's call this equation 5-1.\n\nNow, equation 5-1: -2B - C + 3G = 411.\n\nBut from equation 4-2, we have A expressed in terms of B, C, G. Let me see if we can use that.\n\nAlso, perhaps we can find expressions for other variables.\n\nLet me look at equation 6: A + B + 2C + 2E + 3F = -265.\n\nEquation 7: A + 2B + 3C + 2E + F = -321.\n\nEquation 8: A + 2B + C + 2E + G + 2F = -177.\n\nLet me see if I can find relations between these.\n\nLet me first consider equations 6 and 7. Let's subtract equation 7 from equation 6:\n\n(6) - (7): [A + B + 2C + 2E + 3F] - [A + 2B + 3C + 2E + F] = -265 - (-321)\n\nSimplify:\n\nA - A + B - 2B + 2C - 3C + 2E - 2E + 3F - F = 56\n\nWhich is:\n\n- B - C + 2F = 56 → -B - C + 2F = 56 → equation 6-7.\n\nSimilarly, equation 6-7: -B - C + 2F = 56.\n\nAlso, equation 2-3: -B + C + G - F = 124.\n\nLet me note that.\n\nNow, perhaps I can express F from equation 6-7:\n\nFrom equation 6-7: 2F = B + C + 56 → F = (B + C + 56)/2.\n\nLet me note that.\n\nNow, equation 2-3: -B + C + G - F = 124. Substitute F from above:\n\n- B + C + G - [(B + C + 56)/2] = 124.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate denominator:\n\n-2B + 2C + 2G - (B + C + 56) = 248.\n\nSimplify:\n\n-2B + 2C + 2G - B - C - 56 = 248 → (-3B + C + 2G) -56 = 248 → -3B + C + 2G = 304 → equation 2-3 modified.\n\nLet me call this equation 2-3a: -3B + C + 2G = 304.\n\nAlso, equation 5-1: -2B - C + 3G = 411.\n\nSo now, we have:\n\nEquation 2-3a: -3B + C + 2G = 304.\n\nEquation 5-1: -2B - C + 3G = 411.\n\nLet me add these two equations to eliminate C:\n\n(-3B -2B) + (C - C) + (2G + 3G) = 304 + 411 → -5B + 5G = 715 → divide both sides by 5: -B + G = 143 → G = B + 143. Let's call this equation 5-1 + 2-3a: G = B + 143.\n\nNow, G is expressed in terms of B.\n\nNow, let's substitute G = B + 143 into equation 5-1:\n\n-2B - C + 3G = 411 → substitute G:\n\n-2B - C + 3*(B + 143) = 411 → -2B - C + 3B + 429 = 411 → B - C + 429 = 411 → B - C = -18 → C = B + 18. Let's call this equation C = B + 18.\n\nNow, we have G = B + 143, and C = B + 18.\n\nNow, from equation 6-7: F = (B + C + 56)/2. Since C = B + 18:\n\nF = [B + (B + 18) + 56]/2 = [2B + 74]/2 = B + 37. So F = B + 37.\n\nNow, we have expressions for G, C, F in terms of B.\n\nNow, let's substitute these into equation 4-2: A - B - C + G = 185.\n\nA - B - (B + 18) + (B + 143) = 185 → A - B - B -18 + B + 143 = 185 → A - B -18 + 143 = 185 → A - B + 125 = 185 → A - B = 60 → A = B + 60.\n\nSo now, A is expressed as B + 60.\n\nNow, we have:\n\nA = B + 60,\n\nC = B + 18,\n\nF = B + 37,\n\nG = B + 143.\n\nNow, let's proceed to find B. Let's use equation 1: A + 2B + 2C + 2D + 2E = -100.\n\nSubstituting A, C:\n\n(B + 60) + 2B + 2*(B + 18) + 2D + 2E = -100 → B + 60 + 2B + 2B + 36 + 2D + 2E = -100 → (B + 2B + 2B) + (60 + 36) + 2D + 2E = -100 → 5B + 96 + 2D + 2E = -100 → 5B + 2D + 2E = -196 → equation 1a: 5B + 2D + 2E = -196.\n\nNow, let's find another equation involving D and E. Let's look at equation 2: 2A + 2B + C + D + E + F + G = 4.\n\nSubstituting A, C, F, G:\n\n2*(B + 60) + 2B + (B + 18) + D + E + (B + 37) + (B + 143) = 4.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n2B + 120 + 2B + B + 18 + D + E + B + 37 + B + 143 = 4.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2B + 2B + B + B + B (from 2A, 2B, C, F, G) → 2B + 2B is 4B, plus B (C) is 5B, plus B (F) is 6B, plus B (G) is 7B.\n\nConstants: 120 + 18 + 37 + 143 = let's calculate:\n\n120 + 18 = 138; 138 + 37 = 175; 175 + 143 = 318.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n7B + 318 + D + E = 4 → 7B + D + E = 4 - 318 = -314 → equation 2a: 7B + D + E = -314.\n\nNow, equation 1a: 5B + 2D + 2E = -196.\n\nEquation 2a: 7B + D + E = -314.\n\nLet me denote equation 2a as: D + E = -314 -7B.\n\nMultiply equation 2a by 2: 2D + 2E = 2*(-314 -7B) = -628 -14B.\n\nNow, substitute into equation 1a:\n\n5B + (-628 -14B) = -196 → 5B -14B -628 = -196 → -9B -628 = -196 → -9B = -196 + 628 → -9B = 432 → B = 432 / (-9) → B = -48.\n\nSo B = -48.\n\nNow, we can find other variables:\n\nA = B + 60 = -48 + 60 = 12.\n\nC = B + 18 = -48 + 18 = -30.\n\nF = B + 37 = -48 + 37 = -11.\n\nG = B + 143 = -48 + 143 = 95.\n\nNow, from equation 2a: D + E = -314 -7B = -314 -7*(-48) = -314 + 336 = 22. So D + E = 22.\n\nNow, we need another equation to find D and E. Let's look at equation 5-1? Or perhaps another equation. Let me check equation 5-1: -2B - C + 3G = 411. Wait, we already used that. But since we have B, C, G, maybe we can check if this equation holds. Let me verify:\n\n-2B - C + 3G = -2*(-48) - (-30) + 3*95 = 96 + 30 + 285 = 411. Yes, correct. So that's consistent.\n\nNow, we need to find D and E. Let's use equation 1a and equation 2a. Wait, equation 1a is already used. Let me check other equations.\n\nLooking at equation 5: A + C + 2D + 2E + 3G = 311.\n\nWe have A=12, C=-30, G=95. Let's compute:\n\n12 + (-30) + 2D + 2E + 3*95 = 311 → 12 -30 + 2D + 2E + 285 = 311 → (12 -30) is -18 + 285 = 267. So 267 + 2D + 2E = 311 → 2D + 2E = 311 - 267 = 44 → D + E = 22. Which matches equation 2a. So no new info here.\n\nSo we need another equation involving D and E. Let me look at equation 3 or another equation.\n\nLet me check equation 3: 2A + B + 2C + D + E + 2G = 128.\n\nSubstituting values:\n\n2*12 + (-48) + 2*(-30) + D + E + 2*95 = 128 → 24 -48 -60 + D + E + 190 = 128 → (24 -48 is -24; -24 -60 is -84; -84 + 190 = 106) → 106 + D + E = 128 → D + E = 22. Again same as before.\n\nHmm. So we need another equation. Let me check equation 4: 3A + B + D + E + F + 2G = 189.\n\nSubstituting values:\n\n3*12 + (-48) + D + E + (-11) + 2*95 = 189 → 36 -48 + D + E -11 + 190 = 189 → (36-48 is -12; -12-11 is -23; -23 +190 is 167) → 167 + D + E = 189 → D + E = 22. Same again.\n\nSo no help. Let me check equation 6: A + B + 2C + 2E + 3F = -265.\n\nWait, equation 6: A + B + 2C + 2E + 3F = -265.\n\nSubstituting:\n\nA=12, B=-48, C=-30, F=-11.\n\nSo 12 + (-48) + 2*(-30) + 2E + 3*(-11) = -265 → 12 -48 -60 + 2E -33 = -265 → (12 -48 is -36; -36 -60 is -96; -96 -33 is -129) → -129 + 2E = -265 → 2E = -265 + 129 = -136 → E = -68.\n\nThen, since D + E = 22 → D = 22 - E = 22 - (-68) = 22 + 68 = 90.\n\nSo D = 90, E = -68.\n\nLet me check if these values satisfy other equations.\n\nLet me check equation 7: A + 2B + 3C + 2E + F = -321.\n\nA=12, B=-48, C=-30, E=-68, F=-11.\n\nCompute:\n\n12 + 2*(-48) + 3*(-30) + 2*(-68) + (-11) = 12 -96 -90 -136 -11 = Let's calculate step by step:\n\n12 -96 = -84; -84 -90 = -174; -174 -136 = -310; -310 -11 = -321. Correct. So equation 7 holds.\n\nNow, check equation 8: A + 2B + C + 2E + G + 2F = -177.\n\nA=12, B=-48, C=-30, E=-68, G=95, F=-11.\n\nCompute:\n\n12 + 2*(-48) + (-30) + 2*(-68) + 95 + 2*(-11) = 12 -96 -30 -136 +95 -22.\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nStart with 12 -96 = -84.\n\n-84 -30 = -114.\n\n-114 -136 = -250.\n\n-250 +95 = -155.\n\n-155 -22 = -177.

      "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have a grid with symbols and each row's sum is given. Our task is to find the sum of each column and output that as a list. Hmm, right. First, I need to figure out what each symbol represents numerically. Once I know the values of the symbols, I can compute the column sums.\n\nBut wait, how do I find the numerical values of the symbols? Since each row's sum is provided, maybe I can set up equations based on the symbols in each row and solve them. Let's see. The grid has 10 rows and each row seems to have 8 symbols (since the example answer has four numbers, but maybe the grid has more columns? Wait, looking at the input rows, each line has symbols followed by a number. Let me check the actual grid.\n\nLooking at the first line: \"∵∵∵⊕∵+⊕∵ -489\". Let me count the symbols. Let's see: the first part is symbols, then the sum. Let's count the symbols. Let's take the first line: ∵, ∵, ∵, ⊕, ∵, +, ⊕, ∵. Wait, that's 8 symbols? Wait, maybe the symbols include the '+'? Or is '+' a separator? Wait, the problem says the grid contains several symbols, each representing a numerical value. So the '+' is part of the symbols? Or maybe it's a typo? Wait, looking at the rows:\n\nFirst line: ∵∵∵⊕∵+⊕∵ sum -489. Let me parse that. The symbols are separated by something. Wait, perhaps the symbols are the characters, and the '+' is part of the symbols? Or maybe the '+' is a typo for another symbol? Or perhaps the '+' is a separator between symbols? Wait, the problem says the grid contains several symbols. So maybe each symbol is a single character. Let me check each row:\n\nFirst row: ∵∵∵⊕∵+⊕∵ → the symbols here are ∵, ∵, ∵, ⊕, ∵, +, ⊕, ∵. So there's a '+' in there. So '+' is a symbol. Similarly, other rows have symbols like *, ∅, ♣, ∈, etc. So each of these characters (including '+') is a symbol with a numerical value. So each row is a sequence of symbols, and their sum is given. There are 10 rows, each with 8 symbols. So the grid is 10 rows by 8 columns. Our task is to find the sum of each column (so 8 numbers in total) once we determine the value of each symbol.\n\nBut there are several symbols here. Let me list all the unique symbols. Let's go through each row:\n\nRow 1: ∵, ⊕, +.\nRow 2: *, ∅, +, ♣, ∈.\nRow 3: *, ♣, +, ∈, ∵.\nRow 4: ⊕, +, ∅, +, ∈, ♣.\nRow 5: *, ∈, ∵, ∈, ⊕, ♣, *, ∈.\nWait, row 5 has symbols: *, ∈, ∵, ∈, ⊕, ♣, *, ∈. So that's 8 symbols? Let me count. The fifth line is \"*∈∵∈⊕♣*∈ 13\". So the symbols are *, ∈, ∵, ∈, ⊕, ♣, *, ∈. That's 8 symbols. So each row has exactly 8 symbols. Therefore, the grid is 10 rows by 8 columns. Our goal is to find the sum of each column, which would be 8 numbers.\n\nSo first, we need to find the value of each unique symbol. Let's list all the symbols present. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: ∵, ⊕, +.\nRow 2: *, ∅, +, ♣, ∈.\nRow 3: *, ♣, +, ∈, ∵.\nRow 4: ⊕, +, ∅, +, ∈, ♣.\nRow 5: *, ∈, ∵, ∈, ⊕, ♣, *, ∈.\nRow 6: ∈, ∅, *, ∵, ⊕, ♣, ∵, *.\nRow 7: *, ∵, +, ⊕, ∵, ♣, *, ∵.\nRow 8: ⊕, ⊕, ♣, ⊕, ∵, ∈, ♣, +.\nRow 9: ⊕, +, ♣, ∵, ⊕, ∈, ♣, ∅.\nRow 10: ∅, *, ♣, ∅, ∵, ∅, ∈, ∈.\n\nSo compiling all the symbols:\n\nSymbols: ∵, ⊕, +, *, ∅, ♣, ∈. Let's check if there are others. The first row has '+', others have '+', so total symbols are ∵, ⊕, +, *, ∅, ♣, ∈. That's 7 symbols. Let me confirm:\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nYes, those are the symbols. So we have 7 symbols. Let's denote each symbol as a variable:\n\nLet me assign variables:\n\nLet’s say:\n\nA = ∵\n\nB = ⊕\n\nC = +\n\nD = *\n\nE = ∅\n\nF = ♣\n\nG = ∈\n\nSo each of these symbols has a value. Now, each row's symbols can be converted into an equation where the sum of their values equals the given row sum.\n\nSo, for each row, we can create an equation. For example:\n\nRow 1: A + A + A + B + A + C + B + A = -489. Let me count the number of each symbol in row 1.\n\nRow 1 symbols: [A, A, A, B, A, C, B, A]. Let me count:\n\nA: positions 1,2,3,5,8 → 5 times?\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nRow 1: ∵∵∵⊕∵+⊕∵. Let's split into symbols:\n\nFirst three ∵, then ⊕, then ∵, then +, then ⊕, then ∵. So that's:\n\nSymbols in order: [∵, ∵, ∵, ⊕, ∵, +, ⊕, ∵]. So that's 8 symbols. So A (because ∵ is A) appears 5 times? Let's count:\n\nPositions 1,2,3,5,8: 5 times A.\n\nB (⊕) appears in positions 4 and 7: 2 times.\n\nC (+) appears once in position 6.\n\nSo equation for row 1: 5A + 2B + 1C = -489.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows:\n\nRow 2: *∅+*♣+∈+ 384 → symbols are *, ∅, +, *, ♣, +, ∈, +. So D, E, C, D, F, C, G, C. Let me count:\n\nD (D appears 2 times?), E (once), C (three times?), F (once), G (once). Wait, let me parse the row:\n\nOriginal row: *∅+*♣+∈+ \n\nBreaking into symbols: *, ∅, +, *, ♣, +, ∈, +. So that's 8 symbols. So D (for *), E (for ∅), C (for +), D, F (♣), C, G (∈), C. So the counts are:\n\nD: 2 (positions 1 and 4)\n\nE: 1 (position 2)\n\nC: 3 (positions 3, 6, 8)\n\nF: 1 (position 5)\n\nG: 1 (position 7)\n\nSo equation: 2D + 1E + 3C + 1F + 1G = 384.\n\nSimilarly, proceeding for each row. Let's do this for all 10 rows. Once we have all equations, we can solve for the variables A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Then, once we have their values, we can compute each column's sum by adding up the values of each symbol in that column across all 10 rows.\n\nBut solving seven variables with ten equations might be possible if the system is consistent. However, solving this manually would be tedious. Let me try to set up all equations first.\n\nLet me list all 10 equations:\n\nRow 1: 5A + 2B + 1C = -489.

Substitute C:\n\n3B + 2F + A + G + (-489 -5A -2B) = -182.\n\nSimplify:\n\n3B -2B + 2F + A -5A + G -489 = -182.\n\nWhich is:\n\nB + 2F -4A + G -489 = -182.\n\nRearranged:\n\nB + 2F -4A + G = -182 + 489 = 307. Let's call this Eq8a.\n\nSimilarly, let's substitute C into Eq4:\n\nEq4: 2B + 3C + E + G + F = 160.\n\nSubstitute C:\n\n2B + 3*(-489 -5A -2B) + E + G + F = 160.\n\nCalculate:\n\n2B - 3*489 -15A -6B + E + G + F = 160.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(2B -6B) + (-15A) + (-1467) + E + G + F = 160.\n\nWhich is:\n\n-4B -15A + E + G + F = 160 + 1467 = 1627. Let's call this Eq4a.\n\nSimilarly, Eq9: 2B + C + 2F + A + G + E = -74.\n\nSubstitute C:\n\n2B + (-489 -5A -2B) + 2F + A + G + E = -74.\n\nSimplify:\n\n2B -2B -5A + A + 2F + G + E -489 = -74.\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n-4A + 2F + G + E = -74 + 489 = 415. Let's call this Eq9a.\n\nNow, looking at Eq4a and Eq9a:\n\nEq4a: -4B -15A + E + G + F = 1627.\n\nEq9a: -4A + 2F + G + E = 415.\n\nLet me note that Eq9a has E + G + 2F -4A = 415.\n\nHmm. Maybe we can find another equation involving E, G, F, etc.\n\nLooking at Eq2: 2D + E + 3C + F + G = 384. Substitute C:\n\n2D + E + 3*(-489 -5A -2B) + F + G = 384.\n\nWhich is:\n\n2D + E + F + G - 1467 -15A -6B = 384.\n\nRearranged:\n\n2D -15A -6B + E + F + G = 384 + 1467 = 1851. Let's call this Eq2a.\n\nSimilarly, Eq3: 3D + 2F + C + G + A = 154. Substitute C:\n\n3D + 2F + (-489 -5A -2B) + G + A = 154.\n\nSimplify:\n\n3D + 2F -489 -5A -2B + G + A = 154.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3D + 2F -4A -2B + G = 154 + 489 = 643. Let's call this Eq3a.\n\nNow, let's look at equations involving D. For example, Eq5, Eq7, Eq3a, Eq6, and Eq10.\n\nLet me look at Eq7: 3D + 3A + B + F = -164. Let's call this Eq7.\n\nAnd Eq5: 2D + 3G + A + B + F = 13. Let's call this Eq5.\n\nAnd Eq6: G + E + 2D + 2A + B + F = -61. Eq6.\n\nAnd Eq10: 3E + D + F + A + 2G = 150. Eq10.\n\nThis is getting complex. Let me see if I can express D from Eq7 and substitute into others.\n\nFrom Eq7: 3D = -164 -3A -B -F → D = (-164 -3A -B -F)/3.\n\nBut this might not be helpful immediately. Alternatively, perhaps we can find equations that can be combined.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find equations that can eliminate some variables.\n\nLooking at Eq5 and Eq7. Let me write them again:\n\nEq5: 2D + 3G + A + B + F = 13.\n\nEq7: 3D + 3A + B + F = -164.\n\nIf I subtract Eq5 from Eq7 multiplied by something... Wait, perhaps express D from Eq7 and substitute into Eq5.\n\nFrom Eq7: 3D = -164 -3A -B -F → D = [ -164 -3A -B -F ] / 3.\n\nSubstitute into Eq5:\n\n2 * [ (-164 -3A -B -F)/3 ] + 3G + A + B + F = 13.\n\nMultiply out:\n\n[ -328 -6A -2B -2F ] / 3 + 3G + A + B + F = 13.\n\nMultiply all terms by 3 to eliminate denominator:\n\n-328 -6A -2B -2F + 9G + 3A + 3B + 3F = 39.\n\nSimplify:\n\n-328 -3A + B + F +9G = 39.\n\nRearranged:\n\n-3A + B + F +9G = 39 + 328 = 367. Let's call this Eq5a.\n\nNow, this is another equation involving A, B, F, G.\n\nSimilarly, looking at Eq3a: 3D + 2F -4A -2B + G = 643. And D from Eq7.\n\nSubstituting D from Eq7 into Eq3a:\n\n3 * [ (-164 -3A -B -F)/3 ] + 2F -4A -2B + G = 643.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(-164 -3A -B -F) + 2F -4A -2B + G = 643.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-164 -3A -B -F +2F -4A -2B + G = 643.\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n-164 -7A -3B + F + G = 643.\n\nRearranged:\n\n-7A -3B + F + G = 643 + 164 = 807. Let's call this Eq3b.\n\nNow, we have Eq5a: -3A + B + F +9G = 367.\n\nAnd Eq3b: -7A -3B + F + G = 807.\n\nLet me write them:\n\nEq5a: -3A + B + F +9G = 367.\n\nEq3b: -7A -3B + F + G = 807.\n\nLet me subtract Eq3b from Eq5a to eliminate F? Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nAlternatively, perhaps subtract Eq3b from Eq5a multiplied by something. Let me try to eliminate variables.\n\nLet me denote variables:\n\nLet me consider variables A, B, F, G.\n\nLet me look at Eq5a and Eq3b:\n\nLet me write them again:\n\nEq5a: -3A + B + F +9G = 367.\n\nEq3b: -7A -3B + F + G = 807.\n\nSubtract Eq3b from Eq5a:\n\n(-3A + B + F +9G) - (-7A -3B + F + G) = 367 - 807.\n\nCalculating left side:\n\n-3A + B + F +9G +7A +3B -F -G = 4A +4B +8G.\n\nRight side: -440.\n\nThus:\n\n4A +4B +8G = -440 → Divide by 4:\n\nA + B + 2G = -110. Let's call this EqX.\n\nNow, this is a new equation.\n\nNow, let's see if we can find another equation involving A, B, G.\n\nLooking at Eq8a: B + 2F -4A + G = 307.\n\nBut we need to express F in terms of other variables. Let me see if there's another equation.\n\nLooking at Eq7: 3D + 3A + B + F = -164. But we already used that to get D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps from Eq5a and EqX.\n\nWait, EqX is A + B + 2G = -110.\n\nLet me see if I can find another equation involving A, B, G.\n\nLooking at Eq9a: -4A + 2F + G + E = 415. Hmm, but E is involved here.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Eq4a: -4B -15A + E + G + F = 1627.\n\nHmm, perhaps combining with Eq9a?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need to find equations involving E. Let me look at Eq4a and Eq9a.\n\nEq4a: -4B -15A + E + G + F = 1627.\n\nEq9a: -4A + 2F + G + E = 415.\n\nLet me subtract Eq9a from Eq4a:\n\n[ -4B -15A + E + G + F ] - [ -4A + 2F + G + E ] = 1627 - 415.\n\nLeft side:\n\n-4B -15A + E + G + F +4A -2F -G -E = -4B -11A -F.\n\nRight side: 1212.\n\nSo:\n\n-4B -11A -F = 1212 → Let's call this EqY: -11A -4B -F = 1212.\n\nNow, from EqY, we can express F as:\n\nF = -11A -4B -1212. Let's call this EqY.\n\nNow, substitute this F into other equations.\n\nLet me substitute F into EqX: A + B + 2G = -110.\n\nBut we need more equations. Let's see.\n\nLet me substitute F into Eq8a: B + 2F -4A + G = 307.\n\nSubstituting F from EqY:\n\nB + 2*(-11A -4B -1212) -4A + G = 307.\n\nExpand:\n\nB -22A -8B -2424 -4A + G = 307.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-22A -4A) + (B -8B) + G -2424 = 307.\n\nWhich is:\n\n-26A -7B + G = 307 + 2424 = 2731. Let's call this EqZ.\n\nNow, we have EqX: A + B + 2G = -110.\n\nAnd EqZ: -26A -7B + G = 2731.\n\nLet me solve these two equations for A, B, G.\n\nFrom EqX: A + B = -110 - 2G. Let's call this EqXa.\n\nSubstitute into EqZ:\n\n-26A -7B + G = 2731.\n\nBut I need to express A and B in terms of G. Alternatively, express A from EqXa:\n\nLet me express A = -110 -2G - B. Substitute into EqZ:\n\n-26*(-110 -2G - B) -7B + G = 2731.\n\nCalculate:\n\n26*(110 + 2G + B) -7B + G = 2731.\n\nExpand:\n\n26*110 + 52G + 26B -7B + G = 2731.\n\nCalculate 26*110: 2860.\n\nSo:\n\n2860 + 52G + 19B + G = 2731 → 2860 + 53G + 19B = 2731.\n\nRearranged:\n\n53G + 19B = 2731 - 2860 = -129. Let's call this EqZa.\n\nNow, this equation involves B and G. Let's see if we can find another equation involving B and G.\n\nLooking back, perhaps EqXa and other equations.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at EqY: F = -11A -4B -1212. And from EqX: A = -110 - B - 2G. Substitute into F:\n\nF = -11*(-110 - B - 2G) -4B -1212.\n\nCalculate:\n\n= 1210 + 11B + 22G -4B -1212.\n\nCombine terms:\n\n(11B -4B) + 22G + (1210 -1212) = 7B +22G -2.\n\nSo F = 7B + 22G -2. Let's call this EqYb.\n\nNow, let's see if we can use this in another equation.\n\nLooking back at Eq3b: -7A -3B + F + G = 807. Wait, no, Eq3b was derived earlier? Or perhaps other equations.\n\nAlternatively, let's use Eq5a: -3A + B + F +9G = 367. Substitute A from EqXa and F from EqYb.\n\nFrom EqXa: A = -110 - B - 2G.\n\nFrom EqYb: F = 7B +22G -2.\n\nSubstitute into Eq5a:\n\n-3*(-110 - B - 2G) + B + (7B +22G -2) +9G = 367.\n\nCalculate:\n\n330 +3B +6G + B +7B +22G -2 +9G = 367.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(3B + B +7B) + (6G +22G +9G) + (330 -2) = 367.\n\nWhich is:\n\n11B + 37G + 328 = 367.\n\nRearranged:\n\n11B +37G = 367 - 328 = 39. Let's call this Eq5b.\n\nNow, we have EqZa: 53G + 19B = -129.\n\nAnd Eq5b: 11B +37G = 39.\n\nNow, we have two equations with two variables B and G. Let's solve them.\n\nEquation 1: 19B +53G = -129.\n\nEquation 2: 11B +37G = 39.\n\nLet me use the elimination method. Let me multiply equation 1 by 11 and equation 2 by 19 to eliminate B.\n\nEquation 1 *11: 209B + 583G = -1419.\n\nEquation 2 *19: 209B + 703G = 741.\n\nNow subtract equation 1*11 from equation 2*19:\n\n(209B +703G) - (209B +583G) = 741 - (-1419).\n\nWhich is:\n\n120G = 2160 → G = 2160 / 120 = 18.\n\nSo G = 18.\n\nNow substitute G=18 into equation 2: 11B +37*18 = 39.\n\nCalculate 37*18: 666.\n\nSo 11B + 666 = 39 → 11B = 39 - 666 = -627 → B = -627 / 11 = -57.\n\nSo B = -57.\n\nNow, with B = -57 and G = 18, we can find other variables.\n\nFrom EqX: A + B + 2G = -110 → A + (-57) + 2*18 = -110 → A -57 +36 = -110 → A -21 = -110 → A = -110 +21 = -89.\n\nSo A = -89.\n\nNow, from EqYb: F = 7B +22G -2 = 7*(-57) +22*18 -2.\n\nCalculate:\n\n7*(-57) = -399.\n\n22*18 = 396.\n\nSo F = -399 + 396 -2 = (-3) -2 = -5. So F = -5.\n\nNow, from EqY: F = -11A -4B -1212. Let me verify this with the values we have.\n\nA=-89, B=-57:\n\n-11*(-89) -4*(-57) -1212 = 979 + 228 -1212 = 1207 -1212 = -5. Which matches F=-5. Good.\n\nNow, we have A=-89, B=-57, G=18, F=-5.\n\nNow, let's find C from Eq1: 5A +2B + C = -489.\n\nSubstitute A and B:\n\n5*(-89) + 2*(-57) + C = -489 → -445 -114 + C = -489 → -559 + C = -489 → C = -489 +559 = 70. So C=70.\n\nNow, we have C=70.\n\nNow, let's find D using Eq7: 3D +3A + B + F = -164.\n\nSubstitute A=-89, B=-57, F=-5:\n\n3D + 3*(-89) + (-57) + (-5) = -164 → 3D -267 -57 -5 = -164 → 3D -329 = -164 → 3D = -164 +329 = 165 → D=55.\n\nSo D=55.\n\nNow, we need to find E and other variables. Let's use other equations.\n\nLet me check Eq4a: -4B -15A + E + G + F = 1627.\n\nSubstitute B=-57, A=-89, G=18, F=-5:\n\n-4*(-57) -15*(-89) + E + 18 + (-5) = 1627 → 228 + 1335 + E +13 = 1627 → 228+1335= 1563 +13=1576 → 1576 + E = 1627 → E=1627-1576=51. So E=51.\n\nLet me verify with another equation. For example, Eq4: 2B +3C + E + G + F = 160.\n\nSubstitute B=-57, C=70, E=51, G=18, F=-5:\n\n2*(-57) +3*70 +51 +18 + (-5) = -114 +210 +51 +18 -5 = (-114) + 210 is 96; 96+51=147; 147+18=165; 165-5=160. Correct.\n\nNow, let's check Eq9a: -4A + 2F + G + E = 415. Substitute A=-89, F=-5, G=18, E=51:\n\n-4*(-89) + 2*(-5) +18 +51 = 356 -10 +18 +51 = 356-10=346 +18=364 +51=415. Correct.\n\nNow, let's check Eq6: G + E + 2D + 2A + B + F = -61.\n\nG=18, E=51, D=55, A=-89, B=-57, F=-5:\n\n18 +51 +2*55 +2*(-89) + (-57) + (-5) = 18+51=69; 2*55=110; 2*(-89)=-178. So 69+110=179; 179-178=1; 1 -57 = -56; -56 -5 = -61. Correct.\n\nNow, let's check Eq10: 3E + D + F + A + 2G = 150.\n\nE=51, D=55, F=-5, A=-89, G=18:\n\n3*51 +55 + (-5) + (-89) + 2*18 = 153 +55=208; 208-5=203; 203-89=114; 114 +36=150. Correct.\n\nNow, let's check Eq2a: 2D -15A -6B + E + F + G = 1851.\n\nD=55, A=-89, B=-57, E=51, F=-5, G=18:\n\n2*55=110; -15*(-89)=1335; -6*(-57)=342; so 110 +1335 +342 +51 + (-5) +18 = 110+1335=1445; +342=1787; +51=1838; -5=1833; +18=1851. Correct.\n\nNow, all equations seem to check out. So the values are:\n\nA = ∵ = -89\n\nB = ⊕ = -57\n\nC = + = 70\n\nD = * = 55\n\nE = ∅ = 51\n\nF = ♣ = -5\n\nG = ∈ = 51\n\nNow, we need to compute the sum of each column. The grid has 10 rows and 8 columns. For each column (columns 0 to 7?), we need to sum the values of the symbols in that column across all 10 rows.\n\nBut to do this, we need to know which symbol is in each column of each row.

      "Okay, let's see. I need to find the column sums for this grid based on the row sums provided. Each symbol represents a numerical value. The grid has rows with symbols and their corresponding row totals. My job is to calculate the sum for each column.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many columns there are. Looking at the grid, each row has seven symbols. So there are seven columns. Let me confirm that by checking each row:\n\nFirst row: →%↓→∇∇≈ → seven symbols. The others also seem to have seven. So seven columns total.\n\nEach symbol is a variable representing a number. Let me assign each symbol a variable. Let's list all the symbols present. Let me check:\n\nThe symbols are →, %, ↓, ∇, ≈, ∴, and maybe others. Let me list all unique symbols from the grid:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: →, %, ↓, →, ∇, ∇, ≈\nRow 2: ≈, ≈, ∇, ↓, ∇, %, %\nRow 3: ↓, %, ∇, ↓, →, ∇, ∇\nRow 4: %, →, ≈, ∴, ∴, →, ∴\nRow 5: %, ∇, ∴, ∴, →, %, ≈\nRow 6: ∴, →, ∇, ∴, →, ↓, ∇\nRow 7: ∇, ↓, ≈, ∴, %, ∴, %\nRow 8: ∴, ≈, ∴, ≈, ↓, →, %\nRow 9: %, ∇, ∇, ∴, ↓, ≈, →\n\nSo the unique symbols are →, %, ↓, ∇, ≈, ∴. Wait, in row 4 there's a ∴ symbol. Let me check all symbols again. Yes, the symbols are →, %, ↓, ∇, ≈, ∴. So six different symbols? Wait, let me count:\n\n→, %, ↓, ∇, ≈, ∴. That's six symbols. But maybe there are more? Let me check again. The first row has →, %, ↓, ∇, ≈. Then in row 4, there's ∴. So yes, six symbols. So each symbol has a value that we need to find. But since there are seven columns, and each column's sum depends on the symbols in each column. However, each row's sum is given. So this becomes a system of equations.\n\nLet me think. Let's denote each symbol with a variable:\n\nLet me assign variables:\n\nLet’s say:\n\nA = →\nB = %\nC = ↓\nD = ∇\nE = ≈\nF = ∴\n\nSo each symbol corresponds to a variable. Now, each row is an equation. For example, the first row is → (A) + % (B) + ↓ (C) + → (A) + ∇ (D) + ∇ (D) + ≈ (E) = -56. So the equation is A + B + C + A + D + D + E = -56 → 2A + B + C + 2D + E = -56.\n\nSimilarly, each row gives an equation. Since there are 9 rows, we have 9 equations. But there are 6 variables. Wait, but maybe there are more symbols? Wait, I thought there are six symbols. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the symbols are →, %, ↓, ∇, ≈, ∴. That's six symbols. So six variables. But nine equations. However, there might be inconsistencies unless the equations are dependent. So solving this system will give us the values of each symbol. Once we have the values of each symbol, we can compute the column sums by adding up the symbols in each column and multiplying by their values.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Create equations for each row based on the symbols and their given row sums.\n2. Solve the system of equations to find the numerical values of each symbol.\n3. Once the symbol values are known, compute the sum for each column by adding the corresponding symbols' values in each column.\n\nLet me start by writing down all the equations.\n\nLet me list each row and their equations:\n\nRow 1: [→, %, ↓, →, ∇, ∇, ≈] sum to -56\nEquation 1: A + B + C + A + D + D + E = -56 → 2A + B + C + 2D + E = -56.\n\nRow 2: [≈, ≈, ∇, ↓, ∇, %, %] sum to -43\nEquation 2: E + E + D + C + D + B + B = -43 → 2E + 2D + 2B + C = -43? Wait, let me count:\n\nSymbols in row 2: ≈, ≈, ∇, ↓, ∇, %, % → E, E, D, C, D, B, B. So sum is E + E + D + C + D + B + B = 2E + 2D + 2B + C. Wait, the coefficients would be:\n\n2E (from two ≈s) + 2D (two ∇s) + 2B (two %s) + 1C (one ↓). So equation is 2E + 2D + 2B + C = -43.\n\nRow 3: [↓, %, ∇, ↓, →, ∇, ∇] sum to 156\nSymbols: C, B, D, C, A, D, D → C + B + D + C + A + D + D = A + B + 2C + 3D = 156.\n\nEquation 3: A + B + 2C + 3D = 156.\n\nRow 4: [% , →, ≈, ∴, ∴, →, ∴] sum to 54\nSymbols: B, A, E, F, F, A, F → B + A + E + F + F + A + F = A + A + B + E + 3F = 2A + B + E + 3F = 54.\n\nEquation 4: 2A + B + E + 3F = 54.\n\nRow 5: [% , ∇, ∴, ∴, →, %, ≈] sum to 51\nSymbols: B, D, F, F, A, B, E → B + D + F + F + A + B + E = A + 2B + D + 2F + E = 51.\n\nEquation 5: A + 2B + D + 2F + E = 51.\n\nRow 6: [∴, →, ∇, ∴, →, ↓, ∇] sum to 243\nSymbols: F, A, D, F, A, C, D → F + A + D + F + A + C + D = 2A + 2F + C + 2D = 243.\n\nEquation 6: 2A + 2F + C + 2D = 243.\n\nRow 7: [∇, ↓, ≈, ∴, %, ∴, %] sum to 123\nSymbols: D, C, E, F, B, F, B → D + C + E + F + B + F + B = D + C + E + 2B + 2F = 123.\n\nEquation 7: 2B + 2F + C + D + E = 123.\n\nRow 8: [∴, ≈, ∴, ≈, ↓, →, %] sum to -27\nSymbols: F, E, F, E, C, A, B → F + E + F + E + C + A + B = 2E + 2F + C + A + B = -27.\n\nEquation 8: A + B + 2E + 2F + C = -27.\n\nRow 9: [% , ∇, ∇, ∴, ↓, ≈, →] sum to 100\nSymbols: B, D, D, F, C, E, A → B + D + D + F + C + E + A = A + B + C + E + 2D + F = 100.\n\nEquation 9: A + B + C + E + 2D + F = 100.\n\nSo now, we have 9 equations with 6 variables (A, B, C, D, E, F).

Solving this system might be complex. Let me see if I can find substitutions or use elimination.\n\nFirst, perhaps I can find equations that can be combined. Let me note the variables involved in each equation.\n\nLet me list the variables for each equation:\n\nEquation 1: A, B, C, D, E.\n\nEquation 2: B, C, D, E.\n\nEquation 3: A, B, C, D.\n\nEquation 4: A, B, E, F.\n\nEquation 5: A, B, D, E, F.\n\nEquation 6: A, C, D, F.\n\nEquation 7: B, C, D, E, F.\n\nEquation 8: A, B, C, E, F.\n\nEquation 9: A, B, C, D, E, F.\n\nThis seems quite involved. Let me see if I can express some variables in terms of others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use substitution step by step.\n\nLet me start by looking for equations that can be solved for one variable.\n\nLooking at Equation 3: A + B + 2C + 3D = 156. If I can find expressions for A or B from other equations, maybe.\n\nEquation 1: 2A + B + C + 2D + E = -56. Let me note that.\n\nEquation 2: 2B + 2D + 2E + C = -43. Hmm.\n\nEquation 6: 2A + 2F + C + 2D = 243. Let me note that.\n\nEquation 9: A + B + C + E + 2D + F = 100.\n\nLet me see if I can find equations where variables can be expressed.\n\nLet me try to express variables from equations with fewer variables.\n\nEquation 3 has A, B, C, D. Let's see if I can find another equation involving A, B, C, D.\n\nEquation 1 has A, B, C, D, E. So if I can eliminate E, maybe.\n\nEquation 2 has B, C, D, E. So perhaps combining equations 1 and 2?\n\nLet me try. Let me write equation 1 and equation 2 again:\n\nEquation 1: 2A + B + C + 2D + E = -56.\n\nEquation 2: 2B + 2D + 2E + C = -43.\n\nLet me rearrange equation 2:\n\nC + 2B + 2D + 2E = -43.\n\nLet me see if I can solve for E in equation 1. From equation 1:\n\nE = -56 -2A -B -C -2D.\n\nThen substitute this into equation 2.\n\nEquation 2: C + 2B + 2D + 2E = -43.\n\nSubstitute E:\n\nC + 2B + 2D + 2*(-56 -2A -B -C -2D) = -43.\n\nLet me expand this:\n\nC + 2B + 2D - 112 -4A -2B -2C -4D = -43.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nC -2C = -C.\n\n2B -2B = 0.\n\n2D -4D = -2D.\n\n-4A.\n\n-112.\n\nSo overall:\n\n-4A -C -2D -112 = -43.\n\nThen:\n\n-4A -C -2D = -43 + 112 = 69.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n4A + C + 2D = -69.\n\nLet me note this as Equation 10: 4A + C + 2D = -69.\n\nNow, Equation 3 is A + B + 2C + 3D = 156. Let me see if I can combine this with other equations.\n\nBut I need more equations. Let me check Equation 6: 2A + 2F + C + 2D = 243. Let me note that.\n\nEquation 6: 2A + C + 2D + 2F = 243.\n\nEquation 10 is 4A + C + 2D = -69. If I subtract Equation 10 from Equation 6, perhaps?\n\nWait, Equation 6 minus Equation 10:\n\n(2A + C + 2D + 2F) - (4A + C + 2D) = 243 - (-69)\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n2A -4A + C - C + 2D -2D + 2F = -2A + 2F.\n\nRight side: 243 +69 = 312.\n\nSo -2A + 2F = 312 → divide both sides by 2: -A + F = 156 → F = A + 156. Let me note this as Equation 11: F = A + 156.\n\nThis is useful. Now, Equation 11: F = A + 156.\n\nLet me see if I can use this in other equations. For example, Equation 4: 2A + B + E + 3F = 54.\n\nSubstituting F from Equation 11 into Equation 4:\n\n2A + B + E + 3*(A + 156) = 54 → 2A + B + E + 3A + 468 = 54 → 5A + B + E = 54 - 468 = -414.\n\nEquation 4 becomes: 5A + B + E = -414. Let me call this Equation 4a.\n\nEquation 5: A + 2B + D + E + 2F = 51. Substitute F:\n\nA + 2B + D + E + 2*(A + 156) = 51 → A + 2B + D + E + 2A + 312 = 51 → 3A + 2B + D + E = 51 - 312 = -261. Equation 5a: 3A + 2B + D + E = -261.\n\nEquation 7: 2B + 2F + C + D + E = 123. Substitute F:\n\n2B + 2*(A + 156) + C + D + E = 123 → 2B + 2A + 312 + C + D + E = 123 → 2A + 2B + C + D + E = 123 - 312 = -189. Equation 7a: 2A + 2B + C + D + E = -189.\n\nEquation 8: A + B + C + 2E + 2F = -27. Substitute F:\n\nA + B + C + 2E + 2*(A + 156) = -27 → A + B + C + 2E + 2A + 312 = -27 → 3A + B + C + 2E = -27 - 312 = -339. Equation 8a: 3A + B + C + 2E = -339.\n\nEquation 9: A + B + C + E + 2D + F = 100. Substitute F:\n\nA + B + C + E + 2D + A + 156 = 100 → 2A + B + C + E + 2D = 100 - 156 = -56. Equation 9a: 2A + B + C + E + 2D = -56.\n\nWait, Equation 1 was 2A + B + C + 2D + E = -56. Which is exactly the same as Equation 9a. So Equation 9a is the same as Equation 1. That's interesting. So Equation 9 doesn't add new information. So we can ignore it.\n\nNow, let's see the equations we have so far:\n\nEquation 1: 2A + B + C + 2D + E = -56.\n\nEquation 10: 4A + C + 2D = -69.\n\nEquation 3: A + B + 2C + 3D = 156.\n\nEquation 4a: 5A + B + E = -414.\n\nEquation 5a: 3A + 2B + D + E = -261.\n\nEquation 7a: 2A + 2B + C + D + E = -189.\n\nEquation 8a: 3A + B + C + 2E = -339.\n\nAlso, Equation 11: F = A + 156.\n\nSo now, let's see how to proceed. Let's try to express variables in terms of others.\n\nFrom Equation 10: 4A + C + 2D = -69 → C = -69 -4A -2D. Let me call this Equation 10a: C = -69 -4A -2D.\n\nNow, substitute Equation 10a into other equations where C appears.\n\nEquation 3: A + B + 2C + 3D = 156. Substitute C:\n\nA + B + 2*(-69 -4A -2D) + 3D = 156 → A + B - 138 -8A -4D + 3D = 156 → (A -8A) + B + (-4D +3D) -138 = 156 → -7A + B - D -138 = 156 → -7A + B - D = 156 + 138 = 294. Let's call this Equation 3a: -7A + B - D = 294.\n\nEquation 7a: 2A + 2B + C + D + E = -189. Substitute C:\n\n2A + 2B + (-69 -4A -2D) + D + E = -189 → 2A + 2B -69 -4A -2D + D + E = -189 → (-2A) + 2B - D + E -69 = -189 → -2A + 2B - D + E = -189 + 69 = -120. Let's call this Equation 7b: -2A + 2B - D + E = -120.\n\nEquation 8a: 3A + B + C + 2E = -339. Substitute C:\n\n3A + B + (-69 -4A -2D) + 2E = -339 → 3A + B -69 -4A -2D + 2E = -339 → (-A) + B -2D + 2E -69 = -339 → -A + B -2D + 2E = -339 +69 = -270. Equation 8b: -A + B -2D + 2E = -270.\n\nNow, let's look at Equation 1: 2A + B + C + 2D + E = -56. Substitute C:\n\n2A + B + (-69 -4A -2D) + 2D + E = -56 → 2A + B -69 -4A -2D + 2D + E = -56 → -2A + B + E -69 = -56 → -2A + B + E = -56 +69 = 13. Let me call this Equation 1a: -2A + B + E = 13.\n\nNow, Equation 4a is 5A + B + E = -414. Let me write that again:\n\nEquation 4a: 5A + B + E = -414.\n\nEquation 1a: -2A + B + E = 13.\n\nSubtract Equation 1a from Equation 4a:\n\n(5A + B + E) - (-2A + B + E) = -414 -13 → 5A + B + E +2A -B -E = -427 → 7A = -427 → A = -427 /7 → Let me calculate that. 427 divided by 7 is 61, because 7*60=420, 7*61=427. So A = -61.\n\nSo A = -61.\n\nNow that we have A, let's find F from Equation 11: F = A +156 → F = -61 +156 = 95. So F=95.\n\nNow, let's use A=-61 in other equations.\n\nFirst, Equation 1a: -2A + B + E =13. Substitute A=-61:\n\n-2*(-61) + B + E =13 → 122 + B + E =13 → B + E =13 -122 = -109. Equation 1b: B + E = -109.\n\nEquation 4a: 5A + B + E = -414. With A=-61, 5*(-61) + B + E = -305 + (B + E) = -414. Since B + E = -109, then -305 + (-109) = -414, which checks out. Good.\n\nNow, Equation 3a: -7A + B - D = 294. Substitute A=-61:\n\n-7*(-61) + B - D = 294 → 427 + B - D = 294 → B - D = 294 -427 = -133 → B - D = -133 → Equation 3b: B = D -133.\n\nEquation 7b: -2A + 2B - D + E = -120. Substitute A=-61:\n\n-2*(-61) + 2B - D + E = 122 + 2B - D + E = -120. Let's rearrange:\n\n2B - D + E = -120 -122 = -242. Equation 7c: 2B - D + E = -242.\n\nBut from Equation 1b: B + E = -109 → E = -109 - B. Let me substitute E into Equation 7c.\n\nEquation 7c becomes:\n\n2B - D + (-109 - B) = -242 → 2B - D -109 -B = -242 → B - D -109 = -242 → B - D = -242 +109 = -133. Which is the same as Equation 3b. So no new info here.\n\nEquation 5a: 3A + 2B + D + E = -261. Wait, no, Equation 5a is 3A + 2B + D + E = -261. Let me check.\n\nWait, Equation 5a was derived from Equation 5. Let me recheck:\n\nOriginal Equation 5a: 3A + 2B + D + E = -261. With A=-61, substitute:\n\n3*(-61) + 2B + D + E = -183 + 2B + D + E = -261 → 2B + D + E = -261 +183 = -78. Let me call this Equation 5b: 2B + D + E = -78.\n\nBut from Equation 1b: E = -109 - B. Substitute into Equation 5b:\n\n2B + D + (-109 - B) = -78 → (2B - B) + D -109 = -78 → B + D = -78 + 109 = 31 → Equation 5c: B + D = 31.\n\nNow, from Equation 3b: B = D -133. Substitute into Equation 5c:\n\n(D -133) + D = 31 → 2D -133 = 31 → 2D = 31 +133 = 164 → D = 82.\n\nNow that we have D=82, substitute into Equation 3b: B = 82 -133 = -51. So B = -51.\n\nNow, from Equation 1b: B + E = -109 → -51 + E = -109 → E = -109 +51 = -58. So E = -58.\n\nNow, from Equation 10a: C = -69 -4A -2D. Substitute A=-61, D=82:\n\nC = -69 -4*(-61) -2*(82) = -69 + 244 -164 = Let's calculate step by step:\n\n-69 +244 is 175. 175 -164 = 11. So C = 11.\n\nNow, let's check Equation 3: A + B + 2C + 3D = 156. Substitute A=-61, B=-51, C=11, D=82:\n\n-61 + (-51) + 2*11 + 3*82 = -61 -51 +22 + 246 = (-112) + 268 = 156. Correct.\n\nNow, check Equation 1: 2A + B + C + 2D + E = -56.\n\n2*(-61) + (-51) + 11 + 2*82 + (-58) = -122 -51 +11 + 164 -58 = Let's compute:\n\n-122 -51 = -173; -173 +11 = -162; -162 +164 = 2; 2 -58 = -56. Correct.\n\nNow, check Equation 2: 2B + 2D + 2E + C = -43.\n\nB=-51, D=82, E=-58, C=11.\n\n2*(-51) + 2*82 + 2*(-58) +11 = -102 + 164 -116 +11. Let's compute:\n\n-102 +164 = 62; 62 -116 = -54; -54 +11 = -43. Correct.\n\nGood. Now, moving on to other equations.\n\nNow, we have:\n\nA = -61 (→)\n\nB = -51 (%)\n\nC = 11 (↓)\n\nD = 82 (∇)\n\nE = -58 (≈)\n\nF = 95 (∴)\n\nNow, we need to check other equations to ensure consistency.\n\nEquation 4a: 5A + B + E = -414. 5*(-61) + (-51) + (-58) = -305 -51 -58 = -414. Correct.\n\nEquation 5a: 3A + 2B + D + E = -261. 3*(-61) + 2*(-51) +82 + (-58) = -183 -102 +82 -58 = (-183-102) + (82-58) = -285 +24 = -261. Correct.\n\nEquation 7a: 2A + 2B + C + D + E = -189. 2*(-61) + 2*(-51) +11 +82 + (-58) = -122 -102 +11 +82 -58. Let's compute:\n\n-122-102 = -224; -224 +11= -213; -213 +82 = -131; -131 -58 = -189. Correct.\n\nEquation 8a: 3A + B + C + 2E = -339. 3*(-61) + (-51) +11 + 2*(-58) = -183 -51 +11 -116 = (-183-51) + (11-116) = -234 -105 = -339. Correct.\n\nEquation 9a is same as Equation 1, which is correct.\n\nNow, let's check Equation 6: 2A + 2F + C + 2D = 243. Substitute A=-61, F=95, C=11, D=82:\n\n2*(-61) + 2*95 +11 +2*82 = -122 +190 +11 +164. Let's compute:\n\n-122 +190 = 68; 68 +11=79; 79 +164=243. Correct.\n\nEquation 8: A + B + C + 2E + 2F = -27. Substitute:\n\n-61 + (-51) +11 + 2*(-58) + 2*95 = -61 -51 +11 -116 +190. Let's compute:\n\n-61-51 = -112; -112+11 = -101; -101-116= -217; -217+190= -27. Correct.\n\nEquation 9: A + B + C + E + 2D + F = 100. Wait, earlier we had Equation 9a which was 2A + B + C + E + 2D = -56. Which was same as Equation 1. But original Equation 9 is:\n\nA + B + C + E + 2D + F = 100. Substitute:\n\n-61 + (-51) +11 + (-58) + 2*82 +95 = Let's compute:\n\n-61-51 = -112; -112+11= -101; -101-58= -159; 2*82=164 → -159 +164=5; 5 +95=100. Correct.\n\nSo all equations are satisfied. Great! Now we have all the symbol values:\n\n→ = A = -61\n\n% = B = -51\n\n↓ = C = 11\n\n∇ = D = 82\n\n≈ = E = -58\n\n∴ = F = 95\n\nNow, the next step is to compute the column sums. Each column has symbols from each row. Let's list each column's symbols across the 9 rows, then sum their values.\n\nFirst, we need to determine what each column contains. Let's look at the grid again:\n\nThe grid is as follows (each row has 7 symbols):\n\nRow 1: → % ↓ → ∇ ∇ ≈\nRow 2: ≈ ≈ ∇ ↓ ∇ % %\nRow 3: ↓ % ∇ ↓ → ∇ ∇\nRow 4: % → ≈ ∴ ∴ → ∴\nRow 5: % ∇ ∴ ∴ → % ≈\nRow 6: ∴ → ∇ ∴ → ↓ ∇\nRow 7: ∇ ↓ ≈ ∴ % ∴ %\nRow 8: ∴ ≈ ∴ ≈ ↓ → %\nRow 9: % ∇ ∇ ∴ ↓ ≈ →\n\nLet me list each column from column 1 to column 7.\n\nColumn 1: Row1: →, Row2: ≈, Row3: ↓, Row4: %, Row5: %, Row6: ∴, Row7: ∇, Row8: ∴, Row9: %.\n\nColumn 2: Row1: %, Row2: ≈, Row3: %, Row4: →, Row5: ∇, Row6: →, Row7: ↓, Row8: ≈, Row9: ∇.\n\nColumn 3: Row1: ↓, Row2: ∇, Row3: ∇, Row4: ≈, Row5: ∴, Row6: ∇, Row7: ≈, Row8: ∴, Row9: ∇.\n\nColumn 4: Row1: →, Row2: ↓, Row3: ↓, Row4: ∴, Row5: ∴, Row6: ∴, Row7: ∴, Row8: ≈, Row9: ∴.\n\nColumn 5: Row1: ∇, Row2: ∇, Row3: →, Row4: ∴, Row5: →, Row6: ↓, Row7: %, Row8: ↓, Row9: ↓.\n\nColumn 6: Row1: ∇, Row2: %, Row3: ∇, Row4: →, Row5: %, Row6: ∇, Row7: ∴, Row8: →, Row9: ≈.\n\nColumn 7: Row1: ≈, Row2: %, Row3: ∇, Row4: ∴, Row5: ≈, Row6: ∇, Row7: %, Row8: %, Row9: →.\n\nNow, for each column, substitute the symbols with their values and sum.\n\nLet me compute each column step by step.\n\nColumn 1 symbols: →, ≈, ↓, %, %, ∴, ∇, ∴, %.\n\nValues:\n\n→ = -61\n\n≈ = -58\n\n↓ = 11\n\n% = -51\n\n% = -51\n\n∴ = 95\n\n∇ = 82\n\n∴ = 95\n\n% = -51\n\nSum:\n\n-61 + (-58) +11 + (-51) + (-51) +95 +82 +95 + (-51)\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nStart with -61 -58 = -119\n\n+11 → -108\n\n-51 → -159\n\n-51 → -210\n\n+95 → -115\n\n+82 → -33\n\n+95 → 62\n\n-51 → 11.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate:\n\n-61 (Row1)\n\nRow2: -58 → total -61-58 = -119\n\nRow3: +11 → -119+11= -108\n\nRow4: -51 → -108-51= -159\n\nRow5: -51 → -159-51= -210\n\nRow6: +95 → -210+95= -115\n\nRow7: +82 → -115+82= -33\n\nRow8: +95 → -33+95= 62\n\nRow9: -51 → 62-51= 11.\n\nSo Column 1 sum is 11.\n\nColumn 2 symbols: %, ≈, %, →, ∇, →, ↓, ≈, ∇.\n\nSymbols:\n\n%, ≈, %, →, ∇, →, ↓, ≈, ∇.\n\nValues:\n\n% = -51\n\n≈ = -58\n\n% = -51\n\n→ = -61\n\n∇ = 82\n\n→ = -61\n\n↓ = 11\n\n≈ = -58\n\n∇ = 82\n\nSum:\n\n-51 + (-58) + (-51) + (-61) +82 + (-61) +11 + (-58) +82.\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nStart with -51-58= -109\n\n-109-51= -160\n\n-160-61= -221\n\n+82 → -139\n\n-61 → -139-61= -200\n\n+11 → -189\n\n-58 → -247\n\n+82 → -165.\n\nSo Column 2 sum is -165.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\n-51 (Row1)\n\nRow2: -58 → total -109\n\nRow3: -51 → -160\n\nRow4: -61 → -221\n\nRow5: +82 → -139\n\nRow6: -61 → -139-61= -200\n\nRow7: +11 → -189\n\nRow8: -58 → -247\n\nRow9: +82 → -247+82= -165.
