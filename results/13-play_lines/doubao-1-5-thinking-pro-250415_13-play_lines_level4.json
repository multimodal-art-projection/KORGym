This fills (2,1), (2,2), and (3,1) with 2.\n   \n3. **Number 3**: The initial positions are (2,4) and (4,3). The path connects (2,4) left to (2,3), down to (3,3), then down to (4,3). This fills (2,3), (2,4), (3,3), and (4,3) with 3.\n   \n4. **Number 1**: The remaining empty cells must be filled with 1. The initial positions are (0,0) and (0,4).

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n### Step 1: Connect the 2s\nThe 2s are at positions (0,0) and (0,4) (row 0, columns 0 and 4). The cells between them in row 0 are all 'E's. Filling these with 2s connects the two 2s in a straight horizontal line.  \nRow 0 becomes: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`.\n\n### Step 2: Connect the 5s\nThe 5s are at positions (4,0) and (4,3) (row 4, columns 0 and 3). The cells between them in row 4 are 'E's. Filling these with 5s connects the two 5s in a straight horizontal line.  \nRow 4 becomes: `[5, 5, 5, 5, 4]` (since (4,4) is already 4).\n\n### Step 3: Connect the 1s\nThe 1s are at positions (1,2) and (2,1) (row 1, column 2; row 2, column 1). The cell (1,1) (row 1, column 1) is 'E' and connects these two 1s. Filling (1,1) with 1 creates a path: (1,2) → (1,1) → (2,1).  \nRow 1 becomes: `[3, 1, 1, X, X]`.\n\n### Step 4: Connect the 3s\nThe 3s are at positions (1,0) and (3,3) (row 1, column 0; row 3, column 3). The path from (1,0) to (3,3) can be formed by filling (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), and (3,2) with 3s. This creates a path: (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3).  \nRow 2 becomes: `[3, 1, 4, E, E]` (updating (2,0) to 3).  \nRow 3 becomes: `[3, 3, 3, 3, E]`.\n\n### Step 5: Connect the 4s\nThe 4s are at positions (2,2) and (4,4) (row 2, column 2; row 4, column 4). The path from (2,2) to (4,4) can be formed by filling (2,3), (2,4), and (3,4) with 4s. This creates a path: (2,2) → (2,3) → (2,4) → (3,4) → (4,4).  \nRow 2 becomes: `[3, 1, 4, 4, 4]`.  \nRow 3 becomes: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 4]`.\n\n### Final Check\nAll cells are filled, and each number forms a continuous line without branching. \n\nAnswer: [['2','2','2','2','2'],['3','1','1','X','X'],['3','1','4','4','4'],['3','3','3','3','4'],['5','5','5','5','4']]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.
