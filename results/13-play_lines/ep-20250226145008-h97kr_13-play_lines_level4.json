On the chessboard, 'E' indicates that the element is an empty space, 'X' indicates a node that cannot be passed through, and numbers indicate nodes that need to be connected. You need to fill in the numbers on the empty spaces of the chessboard so that all identical numbers on the chessboard are connected.Moreover, the final chessboard must not have any empty spaces; every cell must be filled with a number (or remain 'X' if it's an impassable cell). Importantly, the connection for each color must form a single continuous line without branching For example, if the initial chessboard is:\nE E E E E\nE X E 3 E\nE 3 E 1 E\nE 2 E E E\n1 E E 2 E\nThe filled chessboard could be:\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 X 3 3 2\n2 3 3 1 2\n2 2 1 1 2\n1 1 1 2 2\nWhen all the numbers on the chessboard are connected, it is considered a game victory, and you score 1 point; otherwise, if any number does not meet the connection requirement, the score will be 0.\n\nBoard:\nEEEEE\n234XE\n1EEE2\nEE341\nEEEEE\n\nPlease output the answer in the form of a list within one line and do not break lines when outputting Answer, e.g., \"Answer: [['E','X','E',...],['E','1','1',...]...]\".\n","epoch":1,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
