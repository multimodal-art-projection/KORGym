For example, note that in the given board:\n\n Row0: 1 E E 4 1  \n Row1: E 4 X E E  \n Row2: E E 2 E 3  \n Row3: E 2 E E E  \n Row4: E E E 3 E  \n\nWe must connect the two 1’s (at (0,0) and (0,4)), the two 4’s (at (0,3) and (1,1)), the two 2’s (at (2,2) and (3,1)), and the two 3’s (at (2,4) and (4,3)). One way to “draw” nonbranching (simple–no extra arms) continuous paths for all numbers is as follows:\n\n• For 4, use the “upper‐side” route: from (1,1) go upward to (0,1) then right to (0,2) then to the fixed (0,3). Thus the 4–cells become: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) and (1,1).\n\n• For 2, choose the short route connecting (2,2) and (3,1) by going left from (2,2) to (2,1) and then down to (3,1). Thus the 2–cells are: (2,2) (given), (2,1) (filled) and (3,1) (given).\n\n• For 3, use a downward then leftward route: start at (2,4) (given) then go down to (3,4), then down to (4,4) and finally left to the fixed (4,3). Thus the 3–cells are: (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) and (4,3).\n\n• Finally, all blank cells not yet used must be filled with 1’s in such a way that the unique 1–path connects the two fixed 1’s (at (0,0) and (0,4)) and forms a single snake. One valid 1–snake is to go downward along the left edge and then snake back upward on the right side. For instance, one may follow this chain (each arrow indicates a move to an orthogonally adjacent cell):\n\n  (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (4,0) → (4,1) → (4,2) → (3,2) → (3,3) → (2,3) → (1,3) → (1,4) → (0,4).\n\nThis uses all remaining blank cells as 1’s.

One valid solution is as follows.\n\nFor color 3 we construct a long path starting at (1,0) then going upward and around the board’s border before ending at (2,2). For example, assign color 3 to the cells in the order:\n (1,0) → (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (0,4) → (1,4) → (2,4) → (3,4) → (4,4) → (4,3) → (4,2) → (3,2) → (2,2).\n\nFor color 1 the endpoints are (2,0) and (3,3). Because (2,0) touches only one “empty” neighbor (namely (2,1)), we force a unique beginning. Then we can continue from (2,1) upward and to the right so that the chain “snakes” until it reaches the other endpoint.

So assign:\n (3,1) → (4,1) → (4,0).\n\nNow we see that every cell (other than the impassable X) has been assigned a number and each number’s cells are connected without branching.\n\nWriting out the final board row‐by‐row we get:\n\n Row0: (0,0)3, (0,1)3, (0,2)3, (0,3)3, (0,4)3  \n Row1: (1,0)3, (1,1)1, (1,2)1, (1,3)1, (1,4)3  \n Row2: (2,0)1, (2,1)1, (2,2)3, (2,3)1, (2,4)3  \n Row3: (3,0)X, (3,1)2, (3,2)3, (3,3)1, (3,4)3  \n Row4: (4,0)2, (4,1)2, (4,2)3, (4,3)3, (4,4)3\n\nSo, the final filled chessboard (each row shown as a list) is:\n\n[['3','3','3','3','3'],['3','1','1','1','3'],['1','1','3','1','3'],['X','2','3','1','3'],['2','2','3','3','3']]\n\nAnswer: [['3','3','3','3','3'],['3','1','1','1','3'],['1','1','3','1','3'],['X','2','3','1','3'],['2','2','3','3','3']]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Notice that (1,2)’s only free neighbor (since others are already fixed with other numbers or obstacles) is (1,1) so we assign that to 2. Similarly, (4,0)’s only available neighbor is (3,0). Then to connect these two “clusters” we use (1,0) and (2,0). Thus the 2–path becomes:\n (1,2) → (1,1) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (4,0).\n\nStep 3. For color 3, the endpoints are (1,3) and (3,3). Their most natural connection goes through (2,3) so that the 3–path is:\n (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3).\n\nStep 4. Placing these assignments on the board while keeping the given X’s in their places, we obtain a completely filled board with every empty space assigned and every same number connected in a single, simple path.\n\nThe final filled board is represented as a list where each row is a list of string values:\n[['1','1','1','1','1'],['2','2','2','3','1'],['2','1','X','3','1'],['2','1','1','3','1'],['2','X','1','1','1']]\n\nAnswer: [['1','1','1','1','1'],['2','2','2','3','1'],['2','1','X','3','1'],['2','1','1','3','1'],['2','X','1','1','1']]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

For instance, for “4” I “routed” a long snake so that the only 4’s on the board follow a single continuous non–branching route joining (1,3) and (3,4). One way to do that is to have the 4‑path run as\n\n (1,3) → left to (1,2) → (1,1) → down to (2,1) → (3,1) → (4,1) → (5,1) → right to (5,2) → (5,3) → (5,4) → up to (4,4) → up to (3,4).\n\nThen I used the remaining empty cells to connect the endpoints for the other numbers:\n• For “2” with endpoints (1,4) and (4,5): I routed through the top‐right by making (1,5), (2,5) and (3,5) equal to 2. Thus the 2‑chain is (1,4) → (1,5) → (2,5) → (3,5) → (4,5).\n• For “1” with endpoints (2,2) and (4,3): I chose the vertical\/horizontal connection using (3,2) and (4,2). So the 1‑chain becomes (2,2) → (3,2) → (4,2) → (4,3).\n• For “3” with endpoints (2,4) and (3,3): I filled the only remaining empty cell (2,3) with 3. This yields the 3‑chain (2,4) → (2,3) → (3,3).\n\nFilling in according to these paths (and preserving the impassable “X”) gives the final board:\n\nRow1: 4, 4, 4, 2, 2  \nRow2: 4, 1, 3, 3, 2  \nRow3: 4, 1, 3, 4, 2  \nRow4: 4, 1, 1, 4, 2  \nRow5: 4, 4, 4, 4, X\n\nEach group forms a single continuous (non–branching) snake that connects its two endpoints, and every empty cell has been filled.\n\nAnswer: [['4','4','4','2','2'],['4','1','3','3','2'],['4','1','3','4','2'],['4','1','1','4','2'],['4','4','4','4','X']]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

For example, we can choose the following routes:\n\n1. For the 4’s: Connect (1,2) to (4,1) by going from (1,2) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (4,1).  \n  Thus, we fill (1,1), (2,1), and (3,1) with 4.\n\n2.

For the 3’s: We must connect (1,5) to (5,5) while avoiding conflict with the 1’s already using the last column from row2 or row3.

Their fixed endpoints are:\n\n • 1 at (row2, col0) and (row4, col1)\n • 2 at (row0, col1) and (row3, col3)\n • 3 at (row1, col0) and (row2, col3)\n • 4 at (row3, col1) and (row4, col4)\n\nNumbering rows from 0 at the top and columns from 0 on the left, the initial board is:\n\nRow0: X 2 E E E  \nRow1: 3 E E E E  \nRow2: 1 X X 3 E  \nRow3: E 4 E 2 E  \nRow4: E 1 E E 4  \n\nThen a valid filling is found as follows:\n\n1.

We start with the board\n\n Row0: 2, E, E, 2, 4  \n Row1: 1, E, E, 1, E  \n Row2: 4, E, X, E, E  \n Row3: 3, E, E, E, 3  \n Row4: E, E, E, E, E\n\nWe must “draw” four non‐branching snakes (paths) connecting the two fixed endpoints for each digit (1, 2, 3, and 4) so that every cell (other than the blocked ‘X’) is part of exactly one snake.\n\nOne solution is to use the very “short” path for the 2’s along the top row:\n • Path2 (digit 2): from (0,0) to (0,3) using the cells (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), and (0,3).  \nThus, row0 becomes: 2, 2, 2, 2, and the already given (0,4) remains 4.\n\nThen we “draw” a long snake for the 4’s connecting (2,0) and (0,4). One neat route is:\n • Start at (2,0)=4, then go right to (2,1)=4, then down to (3,1)=4, right along row3 through (3,2)=4 and (3,3)=4, then go up to (2,3)=4, right to (2,4)=4, then up to (1,4)=4 and finally up to (0,4)=4.\nThis gives the sequence for 4: (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) → (2,3) → (2,4) → (1,4) → (0,4).\n\nFor the 1’s the simplest connection is a straight horizontal line on row1:\n • Path1 (digit 1): (1,0)=1, then (1,1)=1, (1,2)=1, and (1,3)=1.\n\nThat uses row1 col1 and col2. So row1 becomes: 1, 1, 1, 1, and (1,4) we already filled as 4 from the 4–path.\n\nFinally, for digit 3 the endpoints (3,0) and (3,4) will be connected by “diverting” into row4. For example:\n • Path3 (digit 3): start at (3,0)=3, go down to (4,0)=3, then proceed right across row4: (4,1)=3, (4,2)=3, (4,3)=3, then (4,4)=3, and finally go up from (4,4) to (3,4)=3.\n\nChecking each snake:\n• Each snake is “single‐stroked” (its endpoints have only one neighbor of the same digit and the inner cells have exactly two).\n• They cover all cells except the “X.”\n• No snake uses a cell assigned to another.\n\nThus the completed board is:\n\nRow0: 2,2,2,2,4  \nRow1: 1,1,1,1,4  \nRow2: 4,4,X,4,4  \nRow3: 3,4,4,4,3  \nRow4: 3,3,3,3,3\n\nNow to output in the required one‐line list format:\n\nAnswer: [['2','2','2','2','4'],['1','1','1','1','4'],['4','4','X','4','4'],['3','4','4','4','3'],['3','3','3','3','3']]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

In our solution the three groups form nonbranching “snake‐paths” connecting their pre‐placed endpoints. In the final board every cell (except the impassable X) is filled with a number. For example, we decided on:\n\n• Color 2 (whose endpoints are at (0,3) and (2,2)): instead of taking a “down‐then‐right” route, we route from (0,3) leftward via (0,2) and (0,1) then downward through (1,1) and (2,1) to (2,2). (This makes (0,3) and (2,2) the two ends of the 2‐path, each with only one adjacent 2, while the interior cells have exactly two adjacent 2’s.)\n\n• Color 3 (with endpoints at (0,4) and (3,1)): note that (0,4) “sees” only (1,4) as a free neighbor so we must use that cell. Then we continue from (1,4) to (1,3), then to (2,3), then to (3,3), then to (3,2) and finally to (3,1). In this way the two given 3’s become the endpoints (each with one connection) and all “middle” 3’s have two connections.\n\n• The remaining cells (all the unused empties) are assigned the number 1. Color 1’s pre‐placed cells are at (0,0) and (2,4). We “force” color 1 to cover the rest of the unused cells by letting it snake from (0,0) downward from (1,0) and (2,0) through (3,0) then into the bottom row from (4,0) to (4,4) and back upward from (4,4) to (3,4) and finally to (2,4).

In our board the fixed digits are:\n\n • Two 4’s at (0,0) and (0,2)\n • Two 2’s at (0,4) and (1,0)\n • Two 1’s at (2,4) and (4,3)\n • Two 3’s at (3,1) and (4,4)\n\nwith a blocked X at (1,4). The idea is to assign every empty “E” a number (1, 2, 3, or 4) so that (i) every cell (except the X) is filled, (ii) each color’s collection of cells forms one simple “snake‐like” line connecting the given endpoints, and (iii) no two different colors mix.\n\nOne useful solution I found is as follows.\n\nStep 1. For the two 4’s at top‐left, the simplest is to “fill in” between them along row0:\n  Row0 becomes: 4, 4, 4, … \nThat is, (0,0)=4, (0,1)=4, (0,2)=4.\n\nStep 2. For the two 2’s at (1,0) and (0,4) we can “snake” from the left edge in row1 to the top‐right:\n  Choose the path: (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) then up to (0,3) and then right to (0,4).\nThus row1: (1,0)=2, (1,1)=2, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=2 (and (1,4) stays as X),\nand row0: (0,3)=2, (0,4)=2.\nThis yields a proper 2–path.\n\nStep 3. Now consider the remaining region (rows2–4) where the seeds for 1 and 3 lie.\nThe subgrid (rows2–4, columns0–4) is:\n  Row2: [E, E, E, E, 1]  (with 1 at (2,4))\n  Row3: [E, 3, E, E, E]  (with 3 at (3,1))\n  Row4: [E, E, E, 1, 3]  (with 1 at (4,3) and 3 at (4,4))\n\nOne valid partition is to let the “1” path cover a long border and the “3” path fill the remaining cells. Namely, assign “1” as follows:\n  • Start at (2,4) (a given 1) then go left along row2 to fill (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0);\n  • From (2,0) go down to (3,0);\n  • Then from (3,0) go down to row4 along the left side: (4,0), (4,1), (4,2) and finally (4,3) (the second given 1).\nThis “1” chain is a single continuous line connecting (2,4) and (4,3).\n\nThen the remaining cells in this subgrid are assigned “3”. They occur in row3 and row4:\n  • Row3: the cells (3,1) is the given 3; we then fill (3,2), (3,3), and (3,4) with 3’s;\n  • Row4: the only remaining cell is (4,4), which is already a given 3.\nThus we complete the “3” path with the chain: (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) → (3,4) → (4,4).\n\nStep 4. Putting everything together, the complete filled board is:\n\n  Row0: 4, 4, 4, 2, 2\n  Row1: 2, 2, 2, 2, X\n  Row2: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1\n  Row3: 1, 3, 3, 3, 3\n  Row4: 1, 1, 1, 1, 3\n\nEach colored “snake” is a single continuous chain joining its two endpoints, and every cell (except X) is used.\n\nAnswer: [['4','4','4','2','2'],['2','2','2','2','X'],['1','1','1','1','1'],['1','3','3','3','3'],['1','1','1','1','3']]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

One working solution is as follows.\n\nStep 1. Notice that the board (with rows numbered from 0 to 4 and columns from 0 to 4) is initially\n\n Row0: [ E, 1, E, 2, 3 ]\n Row1: [ E, E, E, X, E ]\n Row2: [ E, E, 1, E, E ]\n Row3: [ E, E, 2, E, E ]\n Row4: [ E, E, E, E, 3 ]\n\nThe given endpoints are:\n • Digit 1 at (0,1) and (2,2)\n • Digit 2 at (0,3) and (3,2)\n • Digit 3 at (0,4) and (4,4)\n\nStep 2. It is natural to assign digit 3 a straight vertical path along column 4:\n (0,4)=3 → (1,4)=3 → (2,4)=3 → (3,4)=3 → (4,4)=3\n\nStep 3. Next, we design the path for digit 2. Because the endpoint at (0,3) is blocked from going down by the X at (1,3), the only route is to go left and then snake downward:\n (0,3)=2 → (0,2)=2 → (1,2)=2 → (1,1)=2 → (2,1)=2 → (3,1)=2 → (3,2)=2.\nEach endpoint has only one adjacent 2 and all these cells connect in a single continuous “snake” with no branching.\n\nStep 4. Finally, the remaining cells (all “E”) must be filled by digit 1 whose endpoints are (0,1) and (2,2). Because endpoints must have only one neighbor in their path, we design the following Hamiltonian path for digit 1 covering all unassigned cells:\n Start at the endpoint (0,1)=1. Its only possibility is to connect left to (0,0)=1.\n Then continue downward:\n  (0,1) → (0,0)=1 → (1,0)=1 → (2,0)=1 → (3,0)=1 → (4,0)=1 → (4,1)=1 → (4,2)=1 → (4,3)=1 → (3,3)=1 → (2,3)=1 → finally to the other endpoint (2,2)=1.\nThis gives a continuous, nonbranching 1–path whose endpoints (0,1) and (2,2) touch only one 1 each.\n\nStep 5. Now, every cell that is not “X” has been filled with a digit and the three paths (for 1, 2, and 3) form continuous, nonbranching chains connecting their respective endpoints.\n\nThe final board is (row by row):\n\nRow0: [ '1', '1', '2', '2', '3' ]\nRow1: [ '1', '2', '2', 'X', '3' ]\nRow2: [ '1', '2', '1', '1', '3' ]\nRow3: [ '1', '2', '2', '1', '3' ]\nRow4: [ '1', '1', '1', '1', '3' ]\n\nAnswer: [['1','1','2','2','3'],['1','2','2','X','3'],['1','2','1','1','3'],['1','2','2','1','3'],['1','1','1','1','3']]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

For example, one valid solution is as follows. (We first fix the “short” paths that are forced by very tight spots. As you can check, the 1’s at (3,1) and (4,0) can only be connected by filling (4,1) with a 1; likewise the two 4’s at (2,1) and (3,0) are joined by setting (2,0) to 4. Then for the two “long” colors 2 and 3 we choose routes that “snake” through all open cells. One acceptable solution is:)\n\n• Color 3 must join the endpoint at the very top‐right cell (0,4) and the lower–right cell (4,4). Since (1,4) is blocked (X), the only cell adjacent to (0,4) is (0,3); so we set (0,3) to 3. Then we “latch” (1,3), (2,3), (2,4) and (3,4) on the way down making sure that the cell above (4,4) (namely (3,4)) is 3. (Thus the 3–chain becomes (0,4) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (2,4) → (3,4) → (4,4) – note that every step is between adjacent cells.)\n\n• Color 2 needs to connect its endpoints at (1,0) and (4,3). Note that (1,0)’s only available neighbor (since (1,1) is an X and (2,0) is already used by a 4) is (0,0) so we “force” (0,0) to be 2. Then, to use all empty cells, we assign (0,1) and (0,2) as 2; then from (0,2) we go down to (1,2), then further down (to (2,2)) and then (3,2) then (3,3) so that finally (3,3) touches the other endpoint (4,3) of the 2–chain. (In short, the 2–chain becomes (1,0) → (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3) → (4,3), each move to an adjacent cell.)\n\n• The cells that were already given in the board (the endpoints) plus the ones that “must remain” (X) are not changed.

(Recall that each number’s endpoints must be joined by a single continuous non‐branching path, and every non–X cell must finally have a number.)\n\nStep 1. I noticed that the two 4’s are at (0,0) and (3,0). A simple way to join them is to fill the intervening cells on the first column with 4:\n• (1,0) = 4 and (2,0) = 4.\n\nStep 2. For the 3’s, the given endpoints are at (2,2) and (4,0). One convenient connection is to go “down and left” from (2,2) as follows:\n• (3,2) = 3, (4,2) = 3, and (4,1) = 3 so that the complete path reads: (2,2) → (3,2) → (4,2) → (4,1) → (4,0).\n\nStep 3. The two 1’s appear at (2,4) and (4,3). A neat joining is to “go around” the lower‐right area:\n• (3,4) = 1 and (4,4) = 1, giving (2,4) → (3,4) → (4,4) → (4,3).\n\nStep 4. The two 2’s are at (1,4) and (3,3). I connected them by “bending” through intermediate cells:\n• (1,3) = 2 and (2,3) = 2 form the chain: (1,4) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3).\n\nStep 5. Finally, the two 5’s appear at (0,4) and (3,1). The remaining empty cells are at positions: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1) and (2,1). I designed a 5–chain that uses all of them while connecting (0,4) to (3,1). The chain is:\n• Start at (0,4)=5, then go left to (0,3)=5, (0,2)=5, (0,1)=5, \n• then go down: (1,1)=5, (2,1)=5, and finally down to (3,1)=5.\n\nThe final filled board is:\n\nRow0: 4, 5, 5, 5, 5  \nRow1: 4, 5, X, 2, 2  \nRow2: 4, 5, 3, 2, 1  \nRow3: 4, 5, 3, 2, 1  \nRow4: 3, 3, 3, 1, 1\n\nAll cells (except the impassable X) are now filled; every same–number region forms a single non–branching continuous path connecting the two given endpoints.\n\nAnswer: [['4','5','5','5','5'],['4','5','X','2','2'],['4','5','3','2','1'],['4','5','3','2','1'],['3','3','3','1','1']]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

In the final board each non‐X cell holds a digit and the cells showing the same digit form a single “snake” connecting the two given endpoints.\n\nOne valid solution is as follows. Label the rows 0–4 and columns 0–4. The fixed cells are:\n\n• 3 at (0,3) and (1,0)  \n• 4 at (1,1) and (1,3)  \n• 2 at (1,2) and (3,2)  \n• 1 at (1,4) and (4,4)  \n• 5 at (2,0) and (4,0)  \n• And X at (0,4).\n\nThen we “draw” paths for each number so that (a) every empty cell is filled and (b) each colored “line” is a single continuous (non‐branching) path. For example, one solution is found by using these routes:\n\n– For 5, connect (2,0) to (4,0) simply by going vertically down: assign 5 to (3,0).  \n  Path for 5: (2,0) =5, (3,0)=5, (4,0)=5.\n\n– For 1, use the rightmost column: from (1,4) go down through (2,4) and (3,4) to (4,4).  \n  Path for 1: (1,4)=1, (2,4)=1, (3,4)=1, (4,4)=1.\n\n– For 2, instead of the direct vertical three‐cell route (which would use (2,2)), route it as a 3–cell snake in the center: set (1,2)=2 (endpoint), then (2,2)=2 and finally (3,2)=2 (endpoint).  \n  Path for 2: (1,2)=2, (2,2)=2, (3,2)=2.\n\n– For 4, the endpoints at (1,1) and (1,3) cannot be connected directly because (1,2) is taken. So we take a longer path via the bottom part of the board.

Its endpoints are at (0,3) and (1,0) (given). Notice that row0 still has three empty cells: (0,0), (0,1) and (0,2). We make the snake go:\n  from (1,0)=3 (endpoint) up to (0,0)=3, then (0,1)=3, then (0,2)=3 and finish at (0,3)=3.\n  In order the snake is: (1,0)=3, (0,0)=3, (0,1)=3, (0,2)=3, (0,3)=3.\n\nWhen we place all these assignments into the board the five paths are all continuous lines with exactly two endpoints and no extra “branches,” and every empty cell has been filled (the only “blank” remains the impassable X at row0 col4).\n\nThe final filled board (with rows numbered 0–4) is:\n\nRow0: 3 3 3 3 X  \nRow1: 3 4 2 4 1  \nRow2: 5 4 2 4 1  \nRow3: 5 4 2 4 1  \nRow4: 5 4 4 4 1\n\nBelow is the required one‐line output.\n\nAnswer: [['3','3','3','3','X'],['3','4','2','4','1'],['5','4','2','4','1'],['5','4','2','4','1'],['5','4','4','4','1']]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Start at (row1, col4) then go upward along row0 from right‐to‐left and down the left column. In particular, assign these cells:\n (row1, col4)=2 (given),  \n (row0, col4)=2, (row0, col3)=2, (row0, col2)=2, (row0, col1)=2, (row0, col0)=2,  \n (row1, col0)=2, (row2, col0)=2, (row3, col0)=2, (row4, col0)=2 (given).\n This snake has endpoints (row1, col4) and (row4, col0).\n\n• For group3 (“3”) with endpoints (row1, col1)=3 (given) and (row3, col3)=3 (given), one smooth connection is to extend as follows:\n (row1, col1)=3 → (row1, col2)=3 → (row1, col3)=3 → (row2, col3)=3 → (row3, col3)=3.\n This yields a simple path with only two ends.\n\n• For group1 (“1”) with endpoints (row2, col1)=1 (given) and (row3, col4)=1 (given), the remaining free cells force a route that goes away from the boundary.

For color 1, connect (1,2) to (2,1) by using the adjacent cell (1,1). (Thus, cells (1,2), (1,1) and (2,1) become 1.)\n\n2. For color 2, connect (2,2) to (3,1) by “inserting” (3,2) between them. (So (2,2), (3,2) and (3,1) are 2.)\n\n3. For color 3, note that (2,3) and (4,4) need to be connected. Looking at available neighbors, we work in from (2,3) downward: use (3,3) then (4,3) and finally reach (4,4). (Thus, the chain (2,3)–(3,3)–(4,3)–(4,4) is all 3.)\n\n4. For color 4, use the remaining border. One valid continuous route for color 4 is: start at (4,1) (an endpoint), then go left to (4,0), then upward along the left edge through (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), then continue right along the top row (0,0) to (0,4), then down along the right border at (1,4) and (2,4) until reaching the other endpoint at (3,4). (This constructs a continuous snake including all these border cells.)\n\nFilling in the board with these assignments we have:\n\nRow0 (all border): (0,0) to (0,4) → 4,4,4,4,4.\nRow1: (1,0)=4 (from color 4 border), (1,1)=1 (for connecting color 1), (1,2)=1 (given), (1,3)=X (impassable), (1,4)=4 (from border color 4).\nRow2: (2,0)=4 (border), (2,1)=1 (given), (2,2)=2 (given), (2,3)=3 (given), (2,4)=4 (border).\nRow3: (3,0)=4 (border), (3,1)=2 (given), (3,2)=2 (for color 2 connection), (3,3)=3 (for color 3 path), (3,4)=4 (given).\nRow4: (4,0)=4 (border), (4,1)=4 (given), (4,2)=X (impassable), (4,3)=3 (for color 3 path), (4,4)=3 (given).\n\nEach color now has a single continuous path (without branching) joining its endpoints and every cell (unless originally X) is filled with a digit.\n\nThus the final filled board is:\n\n[['4','4','4','4','4'],['4','1','1','X','4'],['4','1','2','3','4'],['4','2','2','3','4'],['4','4','X','3','3']]\n\nAnswer: [['4','4','4','4','4'],['4','1','1','X','4'],['4','1','2','3','4'],['4','2','2','3','4'],['4','4','X','3','3']]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format. The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER' (without quotes), where YOUR_ANSWER is your final answer to the question, e.g., \"Answer: [['E','X','E',...],['E','1','1',...]...]\".\n\nNext, I will provide an n*n chessboard. On the chessboard, 'E' indicates that the element is an empty space, 'X' indicates a node that cannot be passed through, and numbers indicate nodes that need to be connected. You need to fill in the numbers on the empty spaces of the chessboard so that all identical numbers on the chessboard are connected.Moreover, the final chessboard must not have any empty spaces; every cell must be filled with a number (or remain 'X' if it's an impassable cell). Importantly, the connection for each color must form a single continuous line without branching For example, if the initial chessboard is:\nE E E E E\nE X E 3 E\nE 3 E 1 E\nE 2 E E E\n1 E E 2 E\nThe filled chessboard could be:\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 X 3 3 2\n2 3 3 1 2\n2 2 1 1 2\n1 1 1 2 2\nWhen all the numbers on the chessboard are connected, it is considered a game victory, and you score 1 point; otherwise, if any number does not meet the connection requirement, the score will be 0.\n\nBoard:\nEEEEE\nEE1XE\nE123E\nE2EE4\nE4XE3\n\nPlease output the answer in the form of a list within one line and do not break lines when outputting Answer, e.g., \"Answer: [['E','X','E',...],['E','1','1',...]...]\".\n","epoch":1,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
