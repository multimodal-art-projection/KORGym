Make new guesses:\n   - Looking at the context, we can try to find more words. For example, “subeqeuentl y” is likely “subsequently”. So, “s” might be “s”.\n   - “1941” and the context suggest it could be related to historical events. “maut[unknown]ause[unknown]n” might be “maut h ausen”. So, 🤩=h.\n   - “t[unknown] be[unknown]r[unknown]entwal[unknown]” could be “to bergen - belsen”. So, t=t, 🙄=o.\n   - “c[unknown]nc[unknown]ent[unknown]at[i][unknown]n” could be “concentration”. So, c=c, 🥶=r.\n   - “[unknown]ebe[unknown]ua[unknown]y” could be “december”. So, 🐼=d.\n   - “an[unknown]” could be “and”. So, n=d.\n   - “we[unknown][unknown]e” could be “were”. So, w=w.\n   - “sent” already has “t=t” so it fits with the rest of the guesses.\n   - “camps” already has “c=c” so it fits.\n\n3.

","We know from the hint and history that 🤩 = r. Let's try to make some educated guesses based on the encoded sentence.\n\nLooking at common words and patterns, we can start with some likely letter - emoji pairs. For example, \"in\" is a very common word. If we assume some parts of the sentence might make sense with common English words, we can make the following guesses:\n\nLet's assume 🐻 = e since \"e\" is a very common letter in English and we see it repeated in many places in the encoded sentence. Also, let's guess that 🤑 = a as \"a\" is also very common.\n\nOur guess for this round is: 'Answer: 🤩=r,🐻=e,🤑=a'","Let's analyze the encoded sentence to make new guesses.\nLooking at common English words and patterns in the sentence:\n - In the context of a sentence, we know that 'in 1967' and '$750.00' are clear parts. The word 'in' gives us a bit of a clue about the structure.\n - The word 't🐻' appears multiple times. A common two - letter word starting with 't' is 'to'. So, let's guess 🐻=o.\n - The combination '🤑' is quite frequent. A very common vowel is 'o' which we haven't assigned yet. So, let's guess 🤑=o.\n - The combination '🦊' is also often seen. A common consonant that could fit is 'h'. So, let's guess 🦊=h.\n\nAnswer: 🤩=r,🐻=o,🤑=o,🦊=h","Let's analyze the sentence to make some educated guesses.\n\nWe know that 🤩 = r and 🐻 = o from the history. Looking at common words and patterns in the sentence:\n\nThe word “🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑” could potentially be related to “thought” or something similar. Since 🐻 = o, if we assume 🤔 = t and 🦊 = h, it starts to form a recognizable structure. \n\nLet's assume some other emojis based on common English words and the context of the sentence. For example, “🤑” is quite common and could be “a” as many words use “a”.\n\nLet's also assume “🥺” = s as “t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩”  might be “toxizr” which could be “toxic” if 🥺 = s\n\n\nMy guess for this round is: 🤩=r,🐻=o,🤔=t,🦊=h,🤑=a,🥺=s\nAnswer: 🤩=r,🐻=o,🤔=t,🦊=h,🤑=a,🥺=s","Let's analyze the sentence step - by - step. We already know that 🤩 = r and 🐻 = o.\n\nLooking at the encoded sentence, we see that “t🐻🤖” appears multiple times. Since 🐻 = o,  “to🤖” is likely to be “too”. So, we can assume 🤖 = o.\n\nThe part “😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d” might be “start”. If 🤩 = r, then assuming 😴 = s, 🤔 = a, and 🙄 = t would fit.\n\nLet's also look at “d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺”. If 🤩 = r and 🤔 = a, a possible word could be “darr_”. A common word is “darling”. So, we can assume 🥺 = l and 🤧 = i.\n\nNow, the part “t🥴🤑” could be “the”. So, we can assume 🥴 = h and 🤑 = e.\n\nLet's assume 🐸 = w, 🤗 = n, 🐭 = f, 😈 = m, 😎 = p, and the remaining letters are not really clear from the current analysis, but based on the context we can make a guess.\n\nOur guess for this round is: 🤩=r,🐻=o,🤖=o,😴=s,🤔=a,🙄=t,🥺=l,🤧=i,🤑=e,🥴=h,🐸=w,🤗=n,🐭=f,😈=m,😎=p\n\nAnswer: 🤩=r,🐻=o,🤖=o,😴=s,🤔=a,🙄=t,🥺=l,🤧=i,🤑=e,🥴=h,🐸=w,🤗=n,🐭=f,😈=m,😎=p","Based on the history, we know the correct mappings so far are 🤩=r, 🐻=o, 😴=s, 🤔=a, 🥺=l, 🤑=e, 🥴=h.\nLet's make a new guess for the remaining emojis.

And \"😈\" in the context of \" 🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈\" might be \"m\" making it a word like \"while\". \"🤧\" could be \"k\" as a guess.

Given that 🥵 = e, let's look at common word patterns. A common three - letter word starting with e could be \"the\", so I'll guess that 🐔 = t. Also, \"e\" is often followed by \"r\" in words, so I'll guess 🥶 = r.\n\nAnswer: 🥵=e,🐔=t,🥶=r","Let's analyze the encoded sentence with the given information. We know that 🥵 = e and 🥶 = r from previous feedback.\n\nLooking at common English words and letter frequencies, in the encoded sentence, we can start making some educated guesses.\n\nLet's consider the words around the known emojis. For example, in the first part 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶, with 🥵 = e and 🥶 = r,  a common short word with 'e' and 'r' at the end could suggest that we might be looking at words like 'were' etc.\n\nLet's make a new guess:\nWe assume 🐔 = a (since 'a' is a very common letter), 🐹 = t (because 't' is one of the most common letters in English), 😇 = h (also a common letter).\n\nSo our guess is: 🥵=e,🐔=a,🥶=r,🐹=t,😇=h\n\nAnswer: 🥵=e,🐔=a,🥶=r,🐹=t,😇=h","Based on the previous attempts and the hint, we know that 🥵=e and 🥶=r.\nLet's analyze the sentence. The word 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶  has the pattern where we have repeated emojis for the third and fourth positions. Given that 🥵=e and 🥶=r, and considering common English words, we can make some educated guesses.\nLet's try 🐔=o as it is a common vowel and might fit well in the repeated position. For 🐹, we can try s as many English words start with s. For 😇, we can try a as it is a very common vowel.\nThe new guess is: 🥵=e,🥶=r,🐔=o,🐹=s,😇=a\n\nAnswer: 🥵=e,🥶=r,🐔=o,🐹=s,😇=a","Let's analyze the encoded sentence based on the given hint and history.\n\nWe know for sure that 🥵 = e and 🥶 = r from the feedback. Also, we know that 😇 = a.\n\nLet's look at common words and patterns. In English, common three - letter words starting with 'a' are 'and', 'are', 'all' etc. In the encoded sentence, we have sequences like 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 which might be a longer word. \n\nLet's try to make educated guesses. Since we haven't found a correct value for 🐔 yet, a very common letter is 'i'. Let's assume 🐔 = i. \n\nFor 🐹, we'll try 't' again as it is a very common starting letter. \n\nFor 🥺, a common letter that can fit in many words is 'n'. \n\nLet's assume 🤥 = w, 🤠 = d, 🐵 = h, 👽 = m, 🦆 = f, 🐼 = l, 🤑 = s, 😴 = o\n\nOur guess is: 🥵=e,🥶=r,😇=a,🐔=i,🐹=t,🥺=n,🤥=w,🤠=d,🐵=h,👽=m,🦆=f,🐼=l,🤑=s,😴=o\n\nAnswer: 🥵=e,🥶=r,😇=a,🐔=i,🐹=t,🥺=n,🤥=w,🤠=d,🐵=h,👽=m,🦆=f,🐼=l,🤑=s,😴=o","Based on the history, we know that 🥵=e, 🥶=r, 😇=a, 🥺=n, 🦆=f.\nLet's make a new guess.

Since 🤖 = e, I'll try to analyze the sentence structure. A common word that might fit some of the patterns is \"the\". I'll guess that 🐦 = t and 😇 = h.\n\nAnswer: 🤖=e,🐦=t,😇=h","Let's analyze the encoded sentence based on the new information. We know that 🤖 = e from the hint and from the first - attempt feedback, we know that the guesses of 🐦 = t and 😇 = h were incorrect.\n\nWe can look at the structure of common words in the English language. The encoded sentence has some repeated patterns. For example, the phrase \"🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦\" appears twice. Since we know 🤖 = e, we can start looking for words that fit the pattern.\n\nLet's make some new guesses. We might assume that since 't' is a very common letter, and based on the frequency of the emoji in the sentence, we can guess that 🐦 = t this time again, hoping for a different result. Also, looking at the common word - building patterns, we can guess that 😇 = a as 'a' is also a very common letter.\n\nSo our new guess for this round is:\n🤖=e,🐦=t,😇=a\n\nAnswer: 🤖=e,🐦=t,😇=a","Let's analyze the sentence with the known information that 🤖 = e. Looking at common letter frequencies in the English language, the most common letters are 'e', 't', 'a', 'o', 'i', 'n' etc. We've already guessed that 🐦 is 't' and 😇 is 'a' or 'h' incorrectly.\n\nLet's make a new guess. Since the word - building around the known 'e' (🤖) is crucial, we can start by looking at possible words. For example, in the sequence 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦, with 🤖 = e, it could potentially form words if we make new guesses.\n\nLet's guess that 🐦 = s (a common letter), 😇 = o, and keep the known 🤖 = e.\n\nAnswer: 🤖=e,🐦=s,😇=o","Based on the previous attempts, we know that 🤖=e and 🐦=s. We need to continue guessing the other emojis. A reasonable next - guess could be to assume 😇=i as it is a very common vowel. So the answer for this round is:\nAnswer: 🤖=e,🐦=s,😇=i","Let's analyze the encoded sentence and the previous attempts to make a new guess.\n\nWe know that 🤖 = e and 🐦 = s from the previous correct feedback.\n\nLooking at the encoded sentence, we can try to make educated guesses for other emojis. For example,  \"🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦\" which now reads \"s🐶😍e😇🐵😱😇🤠e🐸s\". A common word - like pattern could be formed.\n\nLet's assume that since \"the\" is a very common word, and we are still looking for the right vowel for 😇, and based on the frequency of words in English,  we might try 😇 = o. Also, we can start making some guesses for other emojis. For 🐵, looking at the context, we can try to assume it represents r as it can form common words in combination with other guessed letters.\n\nNew guess: 🤖=e,🐦=s,😇=o,🐵=r\n\nAnswer: 🤖=e,🐦=s,😇=o,🐵=r","Based on the history, we know that 🤖=e and 🐦=s.

Let's say 🐶 = a, 🐵 = r, and 😍 = n.\n\nSo my guess is: 🤖=e,🐦=s,😇=t,🐶=a,🐵=r,😍=n\nAnswer: 🤖=e,🐦=s,😇=t,🐶=a,🐵=r,😍=n","Let's analyze the encoded sentence and the available information. We know for sure that 🤖 = e and 🐦 = s.\n\nLooking at common English words and the structure of the sentence, let's make a new guess. The pattern \"🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵\" appears multiple times. Since we know 🐦 = s and 🤖 = e,  a common word - like \"student\" comes to mind. So, I'll guess that 😇 = t, 🐵 = n, 🐶 = u, and 😍 = d.\n\nAnswer: 🤖=e,🐦=s,😇=t,🐵=n,🐶=u,😍=d","Let's analyze the sentence and the history of guesses. We know for sure that 🤖=e and 🐦=s and 🐶=u.\n\nLooking at the sentence, we can try to make more educated guesses. Let's assume that based on common English words and patterns, we can make the following new guesses.\n\nSince we often have words like \"the\" and we still haven't found the correct letter for 😇, and considering the frequency of its appearance in the sentence, a likely candidate is \"t\". Also, for 🐵, looking at words where it appears with known letters,  a common letter combination could be \"r\".

So, if 🐮 = t, 🥳 = h, 🥴 = e, then the unknown emoji before “r” (in this case, we can start looking at possible words) might be a known combination.\n   - Let's start with common words and letters. We know that vowels are very important in English.\n   - Let's try to guess for other emojis. Looking at the sentence, we can try to find patterns.
