Based on the feedback from Attempt 1:\n\n- `🤗=a` is correct.\n- `🤠=m` is correct.\n- `🥳=n` is correct.\n- `😂=u` is correct.\n- `🐻=i` is correct.\n- `🦆=f` is incorrect.\n\n### Step 2: Incorporate Correct Answers and Adjust the Incorrect Answer\nFrom Attempt 1 and the hint, we now know:\n- `🤗=a`\n- `🤠=m`\n- `🥳=n`\n- `😂=u`\n- `🐻=i`\n\nSince `🦆=f` was wrong, we need to try a different letter for `🦆`.\n\n### Step 3: Make a New Guess\nThe encoded sentence reads:  \n`osbo😂r🥳e l🤗ter bec🤗🤠e 🤗 j😂dge o🥳 the t🤗le🥳t shows the 🦆 f🤗ctor 🤗🥳d 🤗🤠er🐻c🤗's got t🤗le🥳t.`\n\nConverting known emojis:\n- Replace `🤗` with `a`:  \n  Sentence becomes:  \n  `osbo😂r🥳e later become a jamdge oan the taale🥳t shows the 🦆 factor aand amer🐻ca's got taale🥳t.`\n\nFrom context, this sentence starts resembling something related to \"America’s Got Talent.\" The word \"factor\" also appears later, so perhaps:\n- `🦆=x` (trying \"X\" for \"The X Factor\").\n\n### Step 4: Submit the Answer\nCombine the answers, including the hint and previously correct guesses:\n`Answer: 🤗=a,🤠=m,🥳=n,😂=u,🐻=i,🦆=x`","First, let's analyze the information:\n\n- From the hint and feedback history:\n  - 🤗 = a (Hint, confirmed True).\n  - 🤠 = m (feedback confirmed True).\n  - 🥳 = n (feedback confirmed True).\n  - 😂 = u (feedback confirmed True).\n  - 🐻 = i (feedback confirmed True).\n  - 🦆 is incorrect for both guesses x and f. Therefore, 🦆 must correspond to another letter.\n\nWith this decoding progress, we aim to translate part of the sentence using the confirmed emojis and update the unconfirmed ones.\n\n### Decoded Sentence so far:\n\"osbo😂r🥳e l🤗ter bec🤗🤠e 🤗 j😂dge o🥳 the t🤗le🥳t shows the 🦆 f🤗ctor 🤗🥳d 🤗🤠er🐻c🤗's got t🤗le🥳t.\"\n\nBy substitution:\n- 🤗 = a\n- 🤠 = m\n- 🥳 = n\n- 😂 = u\n- 🐻 = i\n\nDecoded:\n\"osbourne later became a judge on the talent shows the 🦆 factor and america's got talent.\"\n\n🦆 needs to be determined. From context, the unconfirmed emoji 🦆 likely corresponds to \"f\". Historical feedback has ruled out \"f\", meaning 🦆 = t is probable (as \"the t factor\" makes sense).\n\n### Tentative Answer for this guess:\n🤗=a, 🤠=m, 🥳=n, 😂=u, 🐻=i, 🦆=t\n\n---\n\nFinal Output:\nAnswer: 🤗=a,🤠=m,🥳=n,😂=u,🐻=i,🦆=t","Thank you for providing the encoded sentence, rules, hint, and history!

Previous guesses for `🦆=f`, `🦆=x`, and `🦆=t` were incorrect.\n\n3. **Remaining Task:**\n   - Determine the correct letter for `🦆`, given the encoded sentence context.\n\n### Revised Mapping:\nFrom analyzing the sentence context, “the 🦆 factor,” I infer that `🦆` might represent the letter `g` (\"the age factor\" is a possible phrase).\n\n### Answer:\nBased on this reasoning:\n```plaintext\nAnswer: 🤗=a,🤠=m,🥳=n,😂=u,🐻=i,🦆=g\n```","Let's analyze the given encoded sentence:\n\n### Encoded Sentence:\n**osbo😂r🥳e l🤗ter bec🤗🤠e 🤗 j😂dge o🥳 the t🤗le🥳t shows the 🦆 f🤗ctor 🤗🥳d 🤗🤠er🐻c🤗's got t🤗le🥳t.**\n\n### Decoding Progress:\n- We know that `🤗=a` from the hint and history.\n- We know from history that the following mappings are correct:\n  - `🤗=a`  \n  - `🤠=m`\n  - `🥳=n`\n  - `😂=u`\n  - `🐻=i`\n\n### Remaining Tasks:\nThe incorrect guesses for `🦆` in previous attempts were `f`, `x`, `t`, and `g`. This implies we should try a new letter for `🦆`.\n\nNow let's piece together some parts of the encoded sentence based on the mappings we already know:\n\nDecoding fragments:\n1. `osbo😂r🥳e` becomes: **osbourne** (likely the name \"Osbourne\").\n2. `l🤗ter` becomes: **later**.\n3. `bec🤗🤠e` becomes: **became**.\n4. `🤗 j😂dge` becomes: **a judge**.\n5. `o🥳 the t🤗le🥳t` becomes: **on the talent**.\n6. `shows the 🦆 f🤗ctor` suggests \"**X Factor**\" (likely name of a show).\n   - Given this, `🦆=x` seems incorrect (from History), so it may hint at \"F Factor\" (e.g., `🦆=f`).\n7. `🤗🥳d` becomes: **and**.\n8. `🤗🤠er🐻c🤗’s` becomes **America’s** (likely the show \"America’s Got Talent\").\n9. `got t🤗le🥳t` becomes: **got talent**.\n\n### Guesses and Final Mapping:\nTo progress, let’s hypothesize that `🦆=c` (since \"factor\" fits well with \"c\").\n\n### Answer:\n**🤗=a,🤠=m,🥳=n,😂=u,🐻=i,🦆=c**  \nAnswer: 🤗=a,🤠=m,🥳=n,😂=u,🐻=i,🦆=c","Let's analyze your progress and use the hint and history:\n\nWe know the feedback confirms:\n- 🤗 = a ✅\n- 🤠 = m ✅\n- 🥳 = n ✅\n- 😂 = u ✅\n- 🐻 = i ✅\n- 🦆 doesn't correspond to f, x, t, g, or c ❌.\n\n#### Updated Encoded Sentence:\n- osbo😂r🥳e l🤗ter bec🤗🤠e 🤗 j😂dge o🥳 the t🤗le🥳t shows the 🦆 f🤗ctor 🤗🥳d 🤗🤠er🐻c🤗's got t🤗le🥳t.\n\nLet's decode the confirmed parts:\n- 😂 = u, 🥳 = n, 🤗 = a, 🤠 = m, 🐻 = i\n\n#### Partially Decoded Sentence:\n- osbourne later became a judge on the talent shows the 🦆 factor and america's got talent.\n\nNow, let's reassess the letters remaining for 🦆:\nGiven \"the 🦆 factor,\" the best candidate for 🦆 is **\"x\"** because \"the x factor\" is a well-known talent show.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 🤗=a,🤠=m,🥳=n,😂=u,🐻=i,🦆=x"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Words like \"sent,\" \"concentration,\" and \"camps\" are likely present.  \n- Using the hint and common English patterns, we make reasoned guesses for the first round.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Guesses for Attempt 1  \nBased on the hint and clues, I will make the following guesses:  \n1. `🥴 = i` (as \"susi\" aligns with letter positioning, and \"sent\" needs \"i\").  \n2. `🤔 = n` (common in words like \"sent\").  \n3. `🥶 = r` (common in \"sent\" and \"camps\").  \n4. `🐷 = s`.  \n\n---\n\n### Final Output for Attempt 1:  \n`Answer: 😇=e, 🥴=i, 🤔=n, 🥶=r, 🐷=s`","Let's begin by analyzing the current state of the task based on the provided information:\n\n### Known Information:\n- **Hint:** 😇 = e (this is confirmed and must be included in the answer).\n- **Feedback from Attempt 1:**\n  - 😇 = e → Correct\n  - 🥴 = i → Incorrect\n  - 🤔 = n → Incorrect\n  - 🥶 = r → Correct\n  - 🐷 = s → Incorrect\n\n### New Approach:\nFrom the feedback, we know that 🥴, 🤔, and 🐷 are not associated with i, n, and s respectively, so we need to try new mappings for these emojis while keeping the feedback in mind.\n\n### Encoded Sentence:\n`su🥴s😇🤔u😇ntl🐷, 🤮n 🐼😇🥴🥶ua🥶🐷 1941, 600 🥺😇ws w😇🥶😇 s😇nt t🙄 🥴uc🤩😇nwal🐸 an🐸 maut🤩aus😇n c🙄nc😇nt🥶at🤮🙄n cam👽s.`\n\n### Plan:\n1. We'll retain the mappings 😇 = e and 🥶 = r since they are confirmed correct.\n2. We'll test new guesses for the other emojis:\n   - Replace 🥴, 🤔, and 🐷 with new letters.\n   - Introduce corresponding guesses for other recurring emojis.\n\n### Contextual Clues:\nBased on the encoded sentence, this text seems historical and might relate to WWII or concentration camps. Words like \"1941,\" \"camps,\" and potential names such as locations (e.g., Mauthausen) provide context. This can help with educated guesses.\n\n---\n\n### New Guesses:\nLet's now propose new mappings:\n1. 🥴 = u → It appears in \"su🥴s😇\" and at the start of a plural noun.\n2. 🤔 = a → Common in words like \"and,\" \"an,\" and historical texts.\n3. 🐷 = t → Potentially matches with words like \"most,\" \"concentration,\" etc.\n4. 🤮 = o → Appears in structured words where 'o' might align (e.g., \"concentration\").\n5. 🐼 = c → Fits historical and contextual patterns.\n6. 🥺 = p → Likely part of \"pws,\" assuming the word is \"pows\" (prisoners of war).\n7. 🙄 = l → Common in \"-al,\" \"-le,\" etc.\n8. 🤩 = i → Matches words like \"uc🤩😇nwal.\"\n9. 🐸 = d → Appears in potential word endings like \"-nd\" or \"and.\"\n10. 👽 = s → Appears in possible plural nouns like \"camps.\"\n\n---\n\n### Tentative Answer:\n```\nAnswer: 😇=e, 🥶=r, 🥴=u, 🤔=a, 🐷=t, 🤮=o, 🐼=c, 🥺=p, 🙄=l, 🤩=i, 🐸=d, 👽=s\n```","Let's analyze the game step by step.\n\n### Known Information:\n1. **Hint**: 😇 = e\n2. From Attempt 1:\n   - 🥴 = i (False)\n   - 🤔 = n (False)\n   - 🥶 = r (True)\n   - 🐷 = s (False)\n\n3. From Attempt 2:\n   - 🥶 = r (True)\n   - 🥴 = u (False)\n   - 🤔 = a (False)\n   - 🐷 = t (False)\n   - 🤮 = o (False)\n   - 🐼 = c (False)\n   - 🥺 = p (False)\n   - 🙄 = l (False)\n   - 🤩 = i (False)\n   - 🐸 = d (True)\n   - 👽 = s (False)\n\n### Deductions:\n- 😇 is confirmed as `e`.\n- 🥶 is confirmed as `r`.\n- 🐸 is confirmed as `d`.\n\n### Possible Guesses for Remaining Emojis:\nWe know which previous guesses were incorrect, so we need to try new combinations while keeping the correct mappings intact. Based on the encoded sentence, it appears to represent something involving years (e.g., \"1941\") and words like \"concentration camp\" or similar contexts.\n\n### Updated Guess:\nI'll try new possible relationships for the remaining emojis while retaining confirmed values.\n\n- 😇 = e (confirmed)\n- 🥶 = r (confirmed)\n- 🐸 = d (confirmed)\n- 🥴 = u (previously false as `i`, `u`)\n- 🤔 = m (new guess, trying \"m\")\n- 🐷 = t (previous false interpretations were `s`, `t`; new guess = `n`)\n- 🤮 = o (previously guessed as `o`; retrying)\n- 🐼 = a (retrying as `a`)\n- 🥺 = y (new guess)\n- 🙄 = c (new guess)\n- 🤩 = i (re-trying `i`, but likely not it based on feedback)\n- 👽 = k (new guess)\n\n---\n\n### Answer:\n😇=e, 🥶=r, 🐸=d, 🥴=u, 🤔=m, 🐷=n, 🤮=o, 🐼=a, 🥺=y, 🙄=c, 🤩=i, 👽=k","Let's analyze the encoded sentence, review the previous guesses and feedback, and make a more informed guess.\n\n### Encoded Sentence:\n```\nsu🥴s😇🤔u😇ntl🐷, 🤮n 🐼😇🥴🥶ua🥶🐷 1941, 600 🥺😇ws w😇🥶😇 s😇nt t🙄 🥴uc🤩😇nwal🐸 an🐸 maut🤩aus😇n c🙄nc😇nt🥶at🤮🙄n cam👽s.\n```\n\n### Hint:\n- 😇 = e\n\n### History and Feedback:\n#### Attempt 1:\n- Guess: 😇=e, 🥴=i, 🤔=n, 🥶=r, 🐷=s\n- Feedback: {😇: True, 🥴: False, 🤔: False, 🥶: True, 🐷: False}\n\n#### Attempt 2:\n- Guess: 😇=e, 🥶=r, 🥴=u, 🤔=a, 🐷=t, 🤮=o, 🐼=c, 🥺=p, 🙄=l, 🤩=i, 🐸=d, 👽=s\n- Feedback: {😇: True, 🥶: True, 🥴: False, 🤔: False, 🐷: False, 🤮: False, 🐼: False, 🥺: False, 🙄: False, 🤩: False, 🐸: True, 👽: False}\n\n#### Attempt 3:\n- Guess: 😇=e, 🥶=r, 🐸=d, 🥴=u, 🤔=m, 🐷=n, 🤮=o, 🐼=a, 🥺=y, 🙄=c, 🤩=i, 👽=k\n- Feedback: {😇: True, 🥶: True, 🐸: True, 🥴: False, 🤔: False, 🐷: False, 🤮: False, 🐼: False, 🥺: False, 🙄: False, 🤩: False, 👽: False}\n\n### Analysis:\nUsing the feedback:\n1. 😇 = e, 🥶 = r, 🐸 = d are correct.\n2. 🥴, 🤔, 🐷, 🤮, 🐼, 🥺, 🙄, 🤩, 👽 are incorrect in all attempted matches.\n3. Based on repetitions, let's experiment with other letters for unconfirmed emojis.\n\n#### Plan for Attempt 4:\nLet’s try:\n- Keep 😇 = e, 🥶 = r, 🐸 = d.\n- Experiment with 🥴=o (common vowel), 🤔=u, 🐷=m, 🤮=p, 🐼=t, 🥺=l, 🙄=n, 🤩=c, 👽=g.\n\n---\n\n### Updated Guess:\n😇=e, 🥶=r, 🐸=d, 🥴=o, 🤔=u, 🐷=m, 🤮=p, 🐼=t, 🥺=l, 🙄=n, 🤩=c, 👽=g\n\nAnswer: 😇=e, 🥶=r, 🐸=d, 🥴=o, 🤔=u, 🐷=m, 🤮=p, 🐼=t, 🥺=l, 🙄=n, 🤩=c, 👽=g","Let's analyze the information we've gathered and try to deduce the correct mappings for the emojis based on the feedback and hint that 😇=e.\n\n### Key Points from the Feedback:\n1. 😇=e, 🥶=r, and 🐸=d are confirmed correct.\n2. All other guesses so far have been incorrect.\n\n### Breaking Down New Guess Strategy:\n- We know the encoded sentence: `su🥴s😇🤔u😇ntl🐷, 🤮n 🐼😇🥴🥶ua🥶🐷 1941, 600 🥺😇ws w😇🥶😇 s😇nt t🙄 🥴uc🤩😇nwal🐸 an🐸 maut🤩aus😇n c🙄nc😇nt🥶at🤮🙄n cam👽s.`\n- Replacing the confirmed emojis 😇=e, 🥶=r, and 🐸=d, we get:\n  ```\n  su🥴serueent🐷, 🤮n 🐼e🥴reuar🐷 1941, 600 🥺ews were sent t🙄 🥴uc🤩enwald an🐸 maut🤩ausen c🙄ncente🤮🙄n cam👽s.\n  ```\n\n- Based on the history, we know:\n  - 🥴 is not i, u, o.\n  - 🤔 is not n, a, m, u.\n  - 🐷 is not s, t, n, m.\n  - 🤮 is not o, p, p, p.\n  - 🐼 is not c, a, a, t.\n  - 🥺 is not p, y, l, l.\n  - 🙄 is not l, c, n, n.\n  - 🤩 is not i, c, c, c.\n  - 👽 is not s, k, g, g.\n\n### Observations:\n1. The sentence suggests this is historical information.\n2. \"1941, 600\" might indicate a wartime scenario (e.g., World War II), suggesting \"concentration camps\" near the end of the sentence with the words \"Buchenwald\" (\"uc🤩enwald\") and \"Mauthausen\" (\"maut🤩ausen\").\n\n### Updated Guesses:\nTo systematically explore the possibilities for the emojis, our updated guesses are:\n- 😇=e (Hint)\n- 🥶=r (Confirmed)\n- 🐸=d (Confirmed)\n- 🥴=o (Fits in \"su🥴s\" as \"suos\" and in \"B🥴ch\" as \"Buch\")\n- 🤔=u (Fits \"surue\")\n- 🐷=n (Fits \"tent\")\n- 🤮=p (Fits \"sharp\")\n- 🐼=t (Fits \"tent\")\n- 🥺=w (Fits \"600 w\")\n- 🙄=l (Fits in \"tentl\")\n- 🤩=c (Matches \"Buchenwald\")\n- 👽=s (Fits \"camps\")\n\n### Answer:\nAnswer: 😇=e, 🥶=r, 🐸=d, 🥴=o, 🤔=u, 🐷=n, 🤮=p, 🐼=t, 🥺=w, 🙄=l, 🤩=c, 👽=s","First, let’s analyze the problem based on the encoded sentence and the rules described. Here’s the feedback summary so far:\n\n- We know:\n  - 😇 = e (from the hint)\n  - 🥶 = r (confirmed correct)\n  - 🐸 = d (confirmed correct)\n  \n- Remaining uncertain emojis and rejected guesses:\n  - 🥴 is not i, u, or o (still to determine)\n  - 🤔 is not n, a, u (still to determine)\n  - 🐷 is not s, t, m, or n (still to determine)\n  - 🤮 is not o, p (still to determine)\n  - 🐼 is not c, a, t (still to determine)\n  - 🥺 is not p, y, w (still to determine)\n  - 🙄 is not l, c, n (still to determine)\n  - 🤩 is not i, c (still to determine)\n  - 👽 is not k, g, s (still to determine)\n\n### Encoded Sentence for Reference:\n`su🥴s😇🤔u😇ntl🐷, 🤮n 🐼😇🥴🥶ua🥶🐷 1941, 600 🥺😇ws w😇🥶😇 s😇nt t🙄 🥴uc🤩😇nwal🐸 an🐸 maut🤩aus😇n c🙄nc😇nt🥶at🤮🙄n cam👽s.`\n\n### Strategy:\n1. Focus on identifying valid replacements for the remaining emojis.\n2. Keep building guesses carefully from the process of elimination and context of the sentence.\n  \n---\n\n### Round 6 Guess:\nBased on our analysis, I will try the following new assignments:\n\n- 🥴 = o (most likely a vowel based on frequency in the sentence)\n- 🤔 = u (to test the combination)\n- 🐷 = n (highly plausible based on pattern guess)\n- 🤮 = p (fits phonetically after rejected guesses)\n- 🐼 = t (logical placement in the word following “an” in the sentence)\n- 🥺 = l (to test placement in the phrase “600 🥺e”)\n- 🙄 = c (likely to form plausible words like “concentration”)\n- 🤩 = i (could fit as a vowel in several places)\n- 👽 = k (uncommon letter choice to finalize pattern testing)\n\nThus, the submission guess is:\n\n**Answer: 😇=e, 🥶=r, 🐸=d, 🥴=o, 🤔=u, 🐷=n, 🤮=p, 🐼=t, 🥺=l, 🙄=c, 🤩=i, 👽=k**","### Analysis:\nGiven the current encoded sentence and the feedback history:\n1. **Hints and Feedback Summary**:\n   - 😇 = \"e\" — Correct\n   - 🥶 = \"r\" — Correct\n   - 🐸 = \"d\" — Correct\n   - 🥴 = \"o\", 🤔 = \"u\", 🐷 = \"n\", 🤮 = \"p\", 🐼 = \"t\", 🥺 = \"l\", 🙄 = \"c\", 🤩 = \"i\", 👽 = \"k\" — All Incorrect so far.\n\nI will attempt to systematically eliminate incorrect guesses and test possible alternatives.\n\n---\n\n### New Guesses:\n1. Keep the correct mappings unchanged:\n   - 😇 = \"e\", 🥶 = \"r\", 🐸 = \"d\".\n\n2. Reconsider the incorrect mappings:\n   - 🥴: Previous guesses (\"i\", \"u\", \"o\") have failed. It could represent \"a\" as it's a prominent vowel.\n   - 🤔: Previous guesses (\"n\", \"u\", \"m\") have failed. It could represent \"i\".\n   - 🐷: Previous guesses (\"s\", \"t\", \"m\", \"n\") have failed. It could represent \"a\".\n   - 🤮: Previous guesses (\"o\", \"p\", \"p\") failed. It could represent \"m\" because \"m\" fits in \"cam👽s\" suggesting \"camps\".\n   - 🐼: Previous guesses (\"c\", \"a\", \"t\", \"t\") failed. It could represent \"s\".\n   - 🥺: Previous guesses (\"p\", \"y\", \"l\", \"w\", \"l\") failed. It could represent \"a\".\n   - 🙄: Previous guesses (\"l\", \"n\", \"n\", \"c\") failed. It could represent \"n\".\n   - 🤩: Previous guesses (\"i\", \"i\", \"c\", \"i\") failed. It could represent \"t\".\n   - 👽: Previous guesses (\"s\", \"k\", \"g\", \"k\") failed.

Emoji `😇` is confirmed to represent `e`.\n2. Emoji `🥶` is confirmed to represent `r`.\n3. Emoji `🐸` is confirmed to represent `d`.\n4. Emojis `🥴`, `🤔`, `🐷`, `🤮`, `🐼`, `🥺`, `🙄`, `🤩`, and `👽` have all been guessed multiple times incorrectly with different letters.\n\n### Observations from unsuccessful attempts:\n- Emoji `🥴`, for example, has been guessed as `i`, `u`, `o`, and `a`, but all attempts failed. This suggests that `🥴` corresponds to a letter that hasn't yet been guessed. \n- Similar logic applies to other unconfirmed emojis like `🤔`, `🐷`, etc.\n\nLet’s construct the new guess systematically.\n\n### Reasoning for new guesses:\nHere are educated substitutions based on analysis:\n- New letter options are letters remaining unused in feedback from prior guesses. The unused pool includes letters like `g`, `h`, `j`, `k`, `v`, etc.\n- Words like \"concentration\", \"auschwitz\", \"work\", \"and\" are possible given common historical context in the sentence structure.\n\n### New Guess:\n- 😇 = e (confirmed)\n- 🥶 = r (confirmed)\n- 🐸 = d (confirmed)\n- 🥴 = g (new guess)\n- 🤔 = h (new guess)\n- 🐷 = v (new guess)\n- 🤮 = b (new guess)\n- 🐼 = w (new guess)\n- 🥺 = k (new guess)\n- 🙄 = l (new guess)\n- 🤩 = t (new guess)\n- 👽 = f (new guess)\n\n### Answer:\nAnswer: 😇=e, 🥶=r, 🐸=d, 🥴=g, 🤔=h, 🐷=v, 🤮=b, 🐼=w, 🥺=k, 🙄=l, 🤩=t, 👽=f","Given the game board, encoded sentence, hint, and history, I will analyze the history and feedback to make a new guess. Here's the reasoning:\n\nWe know from the hint and history that:\n- 😇 = e (from hint and truth in every guess)\n- 🥶 = r (correct in all guesses where attempted)\n- 🐸 = d (correct in all guesses where attempted)\n\nFrom the feedback history, we see consistent rejection of other emojis for guessed letters. Now, based on eliminated possibilities and patterns, we need to make new guesses. It's possible these emojis correspond to letters not yet guessed or guessed incorrectly previously.\n\nLet's attempt a new combination:\n\n### New Guess:\n- 😇 = e (hint, known correct)\n- 🥶 = r (known correct)\n- 🐸 = d (known correct)\n- 🥴 = l (new guess)\n- 🤔 = t (new guess—potential duplicate)\n- 🐷 = s (new guess—fits common sentence structure)\n- 🤮 = n (new guess—likely a frequent letter)\n- 🐼 = a (new guess—common vowel)\n- 🥺 = o (new guess—common vowel)\n- 🙄 = c (new guess—fits word context)\n- 🤩 = i (new guess—common vowel)\n- 👽 = m (new guess)\n\nHere's the formatted output:\n\n**Answer: 😇=e, 🥶=r, 🐸=d, 🥴=l, 🤔=t, 🐷=s, 🤮=n, 🐼=a, 🥺=o, 🙄=c, 🤩=i, 👽=m**","### Analysis:\nFrom the provided feedback:\n\n1. 😇=e, 🥶=r, 🐸=d are confirmed correct.\n2.

Here is the breakdown:\n\n### Key Points:\n1. The hint tells us 🥵 = e.\n2. In attempt 1, you guessed 🥵 = e, but the feedback indicated that this was **false**. This means 🥵 does NOT represent \"e\", even though the hint suggests it.\n3. We utilize the history and encoded sentence to make educated guesses for the current attempt.\n\nLet’s focus on patterns and frequency:\n- Encoded Sentence: 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 🐵👽 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 1983.\n- Notice the repeated emojis 🐔, 🥵, 🐵, 🥶, and others. We'll attempt some basic guesses based on common English letter frequencies and word structure.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of Sentence:\n1. The first block of the sentence has a double 🐔-emoji, which might indicate a common repeated letter like \"l\", \"s\", or \"o\".\n2. 🥵 is repeated multiple times, suggesting a highly frequent letter (e.g., \"e\" or \"t\"), but we know 🥵 ≠ e.\n3. The sequence \"🐔🐔\" might correspond to something like \"ll\" or \"ee\".\n4. The word \"1983\" confirms the sentence has a mix of letters and a numeral.\n\n---\n\n### Current Guess:\nI'll make the following assignments based on patterns and logic:\n- 🥵 = t (since \"e\" is ruled out, \"t\" is another frequent letter in English).\n- 🐔 = l (assuming the double-letter logic).\n- 🥺 = a (common vowel following consonants).\n- 🐵 = o (frequently used vowel).\n- 🥶 = r.\n- 😇 = h (common in starting or middle positions).\n- 🐹 = w.\n- 👽 = i.\n- 🧐 = d.\n- 🦆 = u.\n- 🐼 = s.\n- 🤥 = y.\n- 🤠 = g.\n\n---\n\n### Final Output (Guess):\nAnswer: 🥵=t,🐔=l,🥺=a,🐵=o,🥶=r,😇=h,🐹=w,👽=i,🧐=d,🦆=u,🐼=s,🤥=y,🤠=g","### Step 1: Analyze the Game State\n\n**Encoded Sentence:**  \n🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 🐵👽 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 1983.\n\n**Known Information:**  \n1. 🥵 = e (Hint explicitly given).  \n2. From previous feedback:  \n   - 🥵 is incorrect in guesses 1 and 2, but we now know it equals \"e\" from the hint.  \n   - 🥶 = r (correct in Guess 2).  \n   - 🧐 = d (correct in Guess 2).\n\n**Incorrect Guesses in History:**  \n🥵 ≠ t, 🐔 ≠ l, 🥺 ≠ a, 🐵 ≠ o, 😇 ≠ h, 🐹 ≠ w, 👽 ≠ i, 🦆 ≠ u, 🐼 ≠ s, 🤥 ≠ y, 🤠 ≠ g.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Patterns and Form Hypotheses  \n\nThe encoded sentence is structured as follows:  \n1. 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶  \n2. 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔  \n3. 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐  \n4. 🐵👽  \n5. 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔  \n6. 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠  \n7. \"1983.\"\n\n#### Observations:\n1. 🥵 appears frequently, which aligns with its mapping to \"e\" (a common letter in English).  \n2. 🥶 occurs twice in close proximity at the end of words, suggesting it could be a common final letter like \"r\".  \n3. 🧐 is at the end of a word, which corresponds well to \"d\".  \n4. No proper nouns seem likely (aside from possible dates), so frequencies and letter positions will guide guesses.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Make Guesses  \n\nUsing frequency analysis and history:  \n1. Replace 🥵 with \"e\", 🥶 with \"r\", and 🧐 with \"d\" wherever they appear.  \n2. Attempt new guesses for the other emojis.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Construct the Answer  \n\nGuesses for this round:  \n- 🥵 = e (hint).\n- 🥶 = r (based on feedback).  \n- 🧐 = d (based on feedback).  \n- Replace other emojis with educated guesses:  \n  - 🐔 = t (likely due to double repetition in 🐔🐔).\n  - 😇 = s (appears frequently at the start).\n  - 🐹 = w (common starter).\n  - 🥺 = a (vowel likely near consonant clusters).\n  - 🐵 = l (likely middle consonant).\n  - 👽 = i (possible filler vowel).\n  - 🦆 = u.  \n  - 🐼 = n (final consonant candidate).  \n  - 🤥 = y.  \n  - 🤠 = g.  \n  - 🤑 = o (common vowel).\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer  \n\n**Answer:** 🥵=e, 🥶=r, 🧐=d, 🐔=t, 😇=s, 🐹=w, 🥺=a, 🐵=l, 👽=i, 🦆=u, 🐼=n, 🤥=y, 🤠=g, 🤑=o.","### Decoding Steps:\n\nFrom the history, we know the following:\n1. 🥵=e (confirmed as correct in History Attempt 3).\n2. 🥶=r (confirmed as correct in History Attempt 3).\n3. 🧐=d (confirmed as correct in History Attempt 3).\n\nFor the rest of the emojis:\n- **Based on History Feedback, attempts to match 🐔, 😇, 🐹, 🥺, 🐵, 👽, 🦆, 🐼, 🤥, 🤠, and 🤑 to specific letters were incorrect.**\n  \nWe need to attempt a different mapping based on the encoded sentence along with what we know:\n  \n### Encoded Sentence:\n`🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 🐵👽 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 1983.`\n\nUsing 🥵=e, 🥶=r, and 🧐=d where available:\n- Substituting these values into the sentence:\n  ```\n  🐹😇🐔🐔e🥺😴e🥶 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 👽🐹e🥶😇🐵e🧐 🐵👽 🦆👽🥶🐼e🐔 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 1983.\n  ```\n\n### Deductive Reasoning to Make the Next Guess:\n1. `'🐔'` appears after `'🐹😇'` and is repeated twice, suggesting it could be an **o** (frequent in doubled words like \"too\").\n2. `'😇'` might be an **h** based on its usage near `'🐔'` which might spell the word \"though\" or \"those\".\n3. `'🐹'` could be **w** (common at the start of words such as \"where\").\n4. `'🥺'` might be **a** (commonly associated with 'e' and 'r').\n5. `'🐵'` could be **l** (common letter near ‘r’).\n6. `'👽'` might be **i** since it is used in smaller words like `'🐵👽'`.\n7. `'🦆'` might be **t** as it could help spell \"the\".\n8. `'🐼'` could be **n** as it pairs well with **t**.\n9. `'🤥'` could be **y** since it precedes a vowel in this context.\n10. `'🤠'` might be **s** (common ending letter in such cases).\n11. `'🤑'` could possibly be **o**.\n\n### Guess for This Round:\n- 🥵=e (confirmed hint)\n- 🥶=r (confirmed correct)\n- 🧐=d (confirmed correct)\n- 🐔=o\n- 😇=h\n- 🐹=w\n- 🥺=a\n- 🐵=l\n- 👽=i\n- 🦆=t\n- 🐼=n\n- 🤥=y\n- 🤠=s\n- 🤑=o\n\n### Answer:\n`Answer: 🥵=e,🥶=r,🧐=d,🐔=o,😇=h,🐹=w,🥺=a,🐵=l,👽=i,🦆=t,🐼=n,🤥=y,🤠=s,🤑=o`","To solve this round of the game, let's analyze the feedback and update our guesses.

Short words such as the first one \"🥵👽\" might be simple words like \"am\" or \"an\". I will test with **👽=m** (so \"🥵👽\" would be \"am\").\n4. Repeated patterns like 🧐🤑 could be \"at\" or \"is\". I will test with **🤑=t** (so 🧐🤑 becomes \"at\").\n5. Examining other frequent occurrences such as 🐵 and 🐶 alongside 🥵, it might be worth trying **🐵=n**, **🐶=d**, as they align with common endings like \"and\", \"ant\".\n6.

Keep in mind the repetition of emojis can provide insights into common letters in English (e.g., vowels or common consonants like 'r', 's', or 'l').\n\n---\n\n### Updated Guesses\nLet's propose new guesses based on word structure and the potentially encoded letters:\n\n1. We keep `🥵 = a` as it’s confirmed.\n2. For `👽`, we hypothesize it could be `e`, because `👽` appears frequently and `e` is the most common letter in English.\n3. For `🤑`, hypothesize it could be `s`. It matches examples where it appears in the middle or end of a word structure.\n4. For `🐵`, try assigning `r`, which fits well with `ar` or ending with `ar` in English words.\n5. For `🐶`, try assigning `l`, as it could form common pairs (e.g., `al` or `la`).\n\n---\n\n### Final Guesses for Attempt 2\n**Answer**: 🥵=a, 👽=e, 🤑=s, 🐵=r, 🐶=l","### Step 1: Analyze Feedback and Understand the Task\nFrom the history:\n\n1. Attempt 1:\n   - 🥵=a: Correct  \n   - 👽=m, 🤑=t, 🐵=n, 🐶=d: All incorrect.\n\n2. Attempt 2:\n   - 🥵=a: Correct (same value carried forward).  \n   - 👽=e, 🤑=s: Incorrect again.  \n   - 🐵=r: Correct.  \n   - 🐶=l: Incorrect.\n\n### Step 2: Derive Possible Answers from the Feedback\nFrom the feedback:\n- 🥵=a is confirmed.  \n- 🐵=r is newly confirmed.\n- 👽 is neither 'm' (Attempt 1) nor 'e' (Attempt 2). It might encode another vowel, likely 'i', 'o', or 'u'.\n- 🤑 is neither 't' nor 's'. This narrows it to another frequent consonant such as 'c', 'l', 'n', etc.\n- 🐶 is not 'd' (Attempt 1) or 'l' (Attempt 2). We need further clues for this.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Reasonable Guess\nLet us guess additional possible values based on the frequency of letters, encoded sentence structure, and hints provided.\n\n### Current Partial Decoding\n- 🥵=a (confirmed).  \n- 🐵=r (confirmed).\n\nOther substitutions:\n- 👽 seems like a vowel. Let's guess 'i'.  \n- 🤑 could be a consonant. Let's guess 'c'.  \n- 🐶 could be another consonant. Let's guess 'g'.\n\n### Step 4: Finalize the Guess\nBased on the analysis and reasoning:\n\n```plaintext\nGuess: 🥵=a, 👽=i, 🤑=c, 🐵=r, 🐶=g\n```\n\n### Step 5: Output in the Required Format\n```plaintext\nAnswer: 🥵=a, 👽=i, 🤑=c, 🐵=r, 🐶=g\n```","### Step 1: Analyzing the history and updating information.\nFrom the history, we understand the following:\n1. 🥵=a (Confirmed correct across all attempts)\n2. 👽 is not m, e, or i.\n3. 🤑 is not t, s, or c.\n4. 🐵=r (Confirmed correct in the second and third attempts).\n5. 🐶 is not d, l, or g.\n\n### Step 2: Strategy for the next guess.\nGiven the feedback, we need to try new potential matches for the remaining emojis, ensuring we include 🥵=a and 🐵=r in our guesses.\n\n#### Remaining possibilities:\n- For 👽, eliminate m, e, i; possible guesses could include o, u, or y.\n- For 🤑, eliminate t, s, c; possible guesses could include l, n, or p.\n- For 🐶, eliminate d, l, g; possible guesses could include n, o, or p.\n\nWe’ll try **👽=u, 🤑=n, and 🐶=o** in this round.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Submitting this round's guess.\nAnswer: 🥵=a, 👽=u, 🤑=n, 🐵=r, 🐶=o","### Explanation:\n\nBased on the rules of the game:\n- 🥵=a has been confirmed as correct and must be included in all future guesses.\n- Feedback regarding 👽=m, 🤑=t, 🐵=n, 🐶=d in Guess 1 shows all incorrect except 🥵=a.\n- Similarly, feedback from other attempts reveals 🐵=r is correct. The rest remains incorrect.\n- Notice that the hint and history eliminate certain mappings for 👽, 🤑, 🐶 as false guesses.\n\nUsing this information, we proceed to try new guesses for the remaining emojis.\n\n---\n\n### Updated Guess for Attempt 5:\n\nI will deduce certain possibilities based on frequency and similar reasoning. Here is my attempt:\n\n🥵 = a (confirmed)  \n👽 = o (new guess)  \n🤑 = l (new guess)  \n🐵 = r (confirmed)  \n🐶 = s (new guess)\n\n---\n\n### Final Guess Submission:\n\n**Answer**: 🥵=a, 👽=o, 🤑=l, 🐵=r, 🐶=s","We are tasked with decoding the sentence by guessing the correct words for the emojis based on previous history and the hint provided. Let's break down the hint and the history of feedback for the guesses so far.\n\n### Current Information:\n1. **Hint**: 🥵 = a  \n2. **Feedback Summary**:\n   - 🥵 is **confirmed** as 'a'.\n   - 👽 has been incorrectly guessed as m, e, i, u, and o.\n   - 🤑 has been incorrectly guessed as t, s, c, n, and l.\n   - 🐵 is **confirmed** as 'r'.\n   - 🐶 has been incorrectly guessed as d, l, g, o, and s.\n\n### Analysis:\nFrom the encoded sentence, we can make the following observations:\n- 🥵 appears frequently and has been confirmed as 'a'.\n- 🐵 appears in multiple confirmed positions. Previously, 'r' was verified.\n- For 👽, none of the vowels except 'a', 'u', 'o', 'e', or 'i' seem to work (leaving consonants as candidates).\n- 🤑 must also be a consonant since vowels have been mostly exhausted in prior guesses.\n- 🐶 could be a consonant since guesses involving vowels or common consonants (like 's') have been marked incorrect.\n\nWe now make a new educated guess for this round.\n\n### Updated Guess (Attempt 6):\n- 🥵 = a (confirmed, from hint)\n- 👽 = h (next candidate consonant not ruled out)\n- 🤑 = p (next candidate consonant not ruled out)\n- 🐵 = r (confirmed)\n- 🐶 = b (next candidate consonant not ruled out)\n\n### Answer:\nAnswer: 🥵=a, 👽=h, 🤑=p, 🐵=r, 🐶=b","Let's analyze the game state and rules and provide another guess:\n\n### Current Facts:\n1. 🥵 = a (confirmed)\n2. 🐵 = r (confirmed)\n3. None of the guesses for 👽 have been correct so far (👽 ≠ m, e, i, u, o, h).\n4. None of the guesses for 🤑 have been correct so far (🤑 ≠ t, s, c, n, l, p).\n5. None of the guesses for 🐶 have been correct so far (🐶 ≠ d, l, g, o, s, b).\n\n### Observations:\n- 🥵 appears very frequently — it's the letter \"a\".\n- 🐵 appears in valid positions for an \"r\".\n- 👽 has resisted all guesses; it has a pattern suggesting it might be a vowel.\n- 🤑 is likely a consonant commonly adjacent to vowels in words.\n- 🐶 hasn't been cracked and does not align with g, o, s, d, l, or b. It could represent another common consonant like t or k.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy Moving Forward:\nWe'll attempt new letters for 👽, 🤑, and 🐶 while keeping 🥵 = a and 🐵 = r consistent. Based on probability, 👽 could be \"y\", 🤑 could be \"p\", and 🐶 could be \"t\".\n\n### New Guess:\n🥵 = a, 👽 = y, 🤑 = p, 🐵 = r, 🐶 = t\n\n---\n\n### Output:\nAnswer: 🥵=a, 👽=y, 🤑=p, 🐵=r, 🐶=t","Based on the history provided, we know that:\n\n- 🥵=a is correct (confirmed multiple times).\n- 🐵=r is correct (confirmed multiple times).\n- 👽=y, 🤑=p, and 🐶=t were incorrect guesses in the previous attempt.\n\nThis suggests that we need to try different letters for 👽, 🤑, and 🐶. We'll retain 🥵=a and 🐵=r since they are correct. I will attempt new substitutions for 👽, 🤑, and 🐶 based on unused letters.\n\n### New Guess:\nLet’s try:\n- 👽=f (unused letter so far)\n- 🤑=b (unused letter so far)\n- 🐶=u (unused letter so far)\n\n### Answer:\nAnswer: 🥵=a, 👽=f, 🤑=b, 🐵=r, 🐶=u","### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n#### Task:\n1. Continue guessing the emojis' corresponding letters based on the provided history and feedback.\n2. Ensure all previously provided correct answers (i.e., `🥵=a` and `🐵=r`) remain in the new answer.\n\n#### Hint and History Analysis:\n1. 🥵 is confirmed to be \"a.\"  \n2. 🐵 is confirmed to be \"r.\"  \n3. 👽 has consistently been guessed incorrectly; it is not one of the previously guessed letters (m, e, i, u, o, h, y, f).  \n4. 🤑 has also consistently been guessed incorrectly; it is not one of the previously guessed letters (t, s, c, n, l, p, b).  \n5. 🐶 has consistently been guessed incorrectly as well; it is not one of the previously guessed letters (d, l, g, o, s, b, t, u).  \n\n#### Next Guess:\n- Based on remaining possibilities for 👽, we move to the next reasonable guess, which is \"k.\"  \n- For 🤑, we try another unused letter, such as \"w.\"  \n- For 🐶, we try another letter, such as \"v.\"  \n\n#### Guess:  \n```plaintext\n🥵=a, 👽=k, 🤑=w, 🐵=r, 🐶=v\n```\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n```plaintext\nAnswer: 🥵=a, 👽=k, 🤑=w, 🐵=r, 🐶=v\n```","Let's carefully analyze the feedback from the previous guesses and narrow down the possibilities.\n\n### Feedback Summary:\n1. 🥵 = a is confirmed.\n2. 👽 has consistently been marked as False for all guesses so far, so it's neither m, e, i, u, o, h, y, f, nor k.\n3. 🤑 has been marked as False for all guesses, so it's not t, s, c, n, l, p, b, w.\n4. 🐵 = r is confirmed.\n5. 🐶 has been marked as False for all guesses, so it's neither d, l, g, o, s, b, t, u, nor v.\n\n### New Guesses:\n- For 👽, we need a new letter that has not been tested yet. Let's guess 👽 = z.\n- For 🤑, we need a new letter. We guess 🤑 = q.\n- For 🐶, we need a new letter.

Sentence analysis suggests potential word matches:\n   - \"the m🥶st\" could be \"the most\", meaning:\n     - 🤓 may be \"s\".\n   - \"d🥶m🐷🐼🐯🐼t\" might be \"dominant\", suggesting:\n     - 🐷 = i.\n   - \"m🐯🤫es\" could be \"makes\", indicating:\n     - 🤫 = k.\n   - \"15 - 20 🐮em🐯🤫es\" implies something about \"females\", so:\n     - 🤫 = k might fit here too.\n\n3. Verifying previous incorrect guesses:\n   Based on the feedback, none of these emojis were correct for the following guesses:\n   - 🐷: y, d, c, s, p (invalid choices ruled out, likely \"i\").\n   - 🤓: h, s, t, i (invalid choices ruled out, likely \"s\").\n   - 🤫: i, e (ruled out; likely \"k\").\n   - 🐦: r, g, k (ruled out; not yet identifiable).\n\n### New Guess:\nUsing these observations, the guess is:\n- 🐯 = a\n- 🥶 = o\n- 😇 = w\n- 🐼 = n\n- 🐮 = f\n- 🐷 = i\n- 🤓 = s\n- 🤫 = k\n- 🐦 = m\n\n### Final Answer in Required Format:\nAnswer: 🐯=a,🥶=o,😇=w,🐼=n,🐮=f,🐷=i,🤓=s,🤫=k,🐦=m","Let's analyze the given data.\n\n### Information so far:\n1.

Short words like `🐯s` may represent common options such as \"as\" or \"is,\" but since `🐯=a`, this must be \"as.\"\n3. Words like `_oo_i_t` suggest 🤫 = \"k\" to form \"lookit,\" or 🤫 could be \"c\" to form \"coosit.\" 🤓 likely represents \"s\" because \"the most dominant\" makes logical sense.\n\n### Next Guess:\nConsidering prior feedback and patterns in the encoded message, I'll guess:\n- 🤓 = s\n- 🤫 = c\n- 🐦 = g\n\n---\n\n### Full Answer:\nAnswer: 🐯=a,🥶=o,😇=w,🐼=n,🐮=f,🐷=i,🤓=s,🤫=c,🐦=g","To solve this word puzzle, I will use the hint (`🐯=a`) and the feedback from previous attempts to refine the guesses and determine the most probable values for the remaining emojis.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis Based on Feedback:\n1.

Given the hint 👽=n, we will decode the sentence starting with this information and attempt educated guesses for other emojis based on context and word structure.\n\n#### Given Encoded Sentence:\n🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\n\n#### Hint:\n👽=n  \n\n#### Reasoning:\n1. Words like “s.” and “i👽” seem to be \"is\" and \"in\" respectively. So:\n   - 🐵 could be \"I\" (start of the sentence and likely a pronoun).\n2. The structure “t🦁e” is very likely the word \"the\":\n   - 🦁=h.\n3. “i👽 t🦁e” almost certainly completes as \"in the\".\n   - This confirms more of the structure.\n4. Next, looking at short words:\n   - \"🤖👽\" likely means \"on\". So, 🤖=o.\n5. Words ending in \"es\" like \"c🤭🐨es\" are likely plurals such as \"comes,\" \"goes,\" etc. Guess 🤭=m and 🐨=e (\"comes\" fits well considering context).\n6. Double letters \"ee\" as in \"l🦆e🐨e\" likely involve commonly doubled letters. Guess 🦆=l.\n7. Refining “i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t” gives \"implement\" (a plausible fit, confirming 🤭=m and finalizing the fit).\n\nWe’ll use these steps to deduce as much as possible in one pass.\n\n---\n\n### Answer:\n🐵=I, 👽=n, 🦆=l, 🤭=m, 🐨=e, 🦁=h, 🤖=o, 🐶=u, 🐻=d  \n\nAnswer: 🐵=I, 👽=n, 🦆=l, 🤭=m, 🐨=e, 🦁=h, 🤖=o, 🐶=u, 🐻=d","To find the correct word mapping, we should adjust our guesses based on the feedback from Attempt 1:\n\nFeedback analysis:\n- 🐵: False → 🐵 is not 'I'.\n- 👽: True → 👽 is 'n' (as per the hint).\n- 🦆: False → 🦆 is not 'l'.\n- 🤭: False → 🤭 is not 'm'.\n- 🐨: False → 🐨 is not 'e'.\n- 🦁: True → 🦁 is 'h'.\n- 🤖: False → 🤖 is not 'o'.\n- 🐶: False → 🐶 is not 'u'.\n- 🐻: True → 🐻 is 'd'.\n\nWith this, I will readjust our guesses for Attempt 2 based on the feedback:\n\n- 🐵: Let's guess 'A' for 🐵 this time (common word starter).\n- 👽: Confirmed as 'n'.\n- 🦆: Let's guess 'g' for 🦆 (potential guess based on sentence structure).\n- 🤭: Let's guess 'r' for 🤭 (common consonant in words).\n- 🐨: Let's guess 'a' for 🐨 (common vowel in English).\n- 🦁: Confirmed as 'h'.\n- 🤖: Let's guess 's' for 🤖 (fits contextually).\n- 🐶: Let's guess 't' for 🐶 (could be part of 'the').\n- 🐻: Confirmed as 'd'.\n\n**Guess for Attempt 2**:\n🐵=A, 👽=n, 🦆=g, 🤭=r, 🐨=a, 🦁=h, 🤖=s, 🐶=t, 🐻=d\n\nAnswer: 🐵=A, 👽=n, 🦆=g, 🤭=r, 🐨=a, 🦁=h, 🤖=s, 🐶=t, 🐻=d","Let’s analyze the problem based on the encoded sentence, hints, and feedback from your previous guesses.\n\n### Encoded Sentence:\n```plaintext\n🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\n```\n\n### Current Hint:\n- `👽 = n` (correct and must remain unchanged).\n\n### Feedback from Previous Guesses:\n#### Attempt 1:\nFeedback shows:\n- 🐵=I was incorrect.\n- 👽=n was correct.\n- 🦆=l and 🤭=m were incorrect.\n- 🦁=h was correct.\n- 🐻=d was correct.\n\n#### Attempt 2:\nFeedback shows:\n- 🐵=A was incorrect.\n- 👽=n was correct.\n- 🦆=g, 🤭=r, and 🐨=a were incorrect.\n- 🦁=h was correct.\n- 🐻=d was correct.\n\n### Observations:\n- `🐵` was guessed as both `I` and `A` and was incorrect both times.\n- `🦆` was guessed as `l` and `g` and was incorrect both times.\n- `🤭` was guessed as `m` and `r` and was incorrect both times.\n- `🐨` was guessed as `e` and `a` and was incorrect both times.\n- `🤖` was guessed as `o` and `s` and was incorrect both times.\n- So far, only `👽=n`, `🦁=h`, and `🐻=d` are known and correct.\n\n### Logical Deduction:\n1. Let’s revisit the encoded sentence and look for likely words based on the known letters.\n   - Words in English frequently start with \"Th...\" given the repetition of `t🦁e`. Likely, `t = t`.\n   - The word \"when\" may fit, given `w🤖🐶`. Thus, `w=w`, `🤖=h`, and `🐶=e` are likely candidates.\n   - The last word, `e👽🐻,` could fit \"end\".\n\n2. Consider the sentence structure:\n   - Looking at the sentence, it might be something like: \"It is simple text in the __ __ ends.\"\n     This pattern matches the length of the phrases quite well.\n\n3.

It could be \"O.\"\n2. 🦆 and 🤭 might correspond to vowel\/consonant pairings; since \"m,\" \"g,\" \"l,\" \"r,\" \"c,\" and \"a\" have failed, let's test \"t\" and \"s.\"\n3. 🐨 could correspond to \"e.\"\n4. 🤖 might correspond to \"o,\" \"t,\" or \"u,\" since \"w\" and \"s\" have failed.\n5. 🐶 might correspond to a vowel such as \"i,\" \"a,\" or \"o.\"\n6.

Likely words: Common English sentence structures (e.g., \"It is\", \"in the\", \"when\", etc.) will help infer the encoded letters.\n3. Context clues:\n    - `👽=n` fits in the potential words \"in\", \"when\", \"then\", etc.\n    - `🦁=h` aligns with \"the\" and potentially \"this\".\n    - `🐻=d` likely appears in \"and\", \"end\", or similar.\n\n### Step 2: A new guess\nBy integrating previous feedback and rebuilding potential matches, here is the next attempt:\n\n`🐵` could be a vowel (E.g., \"A\", \"I\", or \"O\") since standalone letters are often vowels.\n`🦆` could fit in \"this\", \"is\", or \"it\".\n`🐨` could align with \"letters like 'a' or 't'\".\n\n---\n\n### Guess:\n🐵=A, 👽=n, 🦆=i, 🤭=t, 🐨=s, 🦁=h, 🤖=e, 🐶=r, 🐻=d\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Final Answer\nAnswer: 🐵=A, 👽=n, 🦆=i, 🤭=t, 🐨=s, 🦁=h, 🤖=e, 🐶=r, 🐻=d","Let's analyze the results and feedback carefully and provide a new guess.\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Emoji Deduction from History**:\n   - `👽=n`: Confirmed correct in all attempts and is the hint.\n   - `🦁=h`: Confirmed correct since attempt 1.\n   - `🐻=d`: Confirmed correct since attempt 1.\n   - `🐶=r`: Confirmed correct from Attempt 6.\n\n2. **Remaining Emojis**:\n   - `🐵, 🦆, 🤭, 🐨, 🤖`\n   - All have no confirmed mappings so far.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Keep the already confirmed mappings: `👽=n`, `🦁=h`, `🐻=d`, `🐶=r`.\n   - Focus on refining guesses for the remaining emojis.  \n   - Use word patterns to try plausible English words.\n\n### **New Guess**:\nI'll try different letter substitutions that match the encoded pattern and feedback.\n\n**Encoded Sentence**:  \n`🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.`\n\nWith confirmed guesses filled in:  \n`🐵. s. in🤭le🐨ent in the w🤖r c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖n end.`  \n\nLikely Plausible English mappings:  \n1. `🤭=g` (seems to fit \"single\").\n2. `🐨=t` (fits \"intent\" and \"context\").\n3. `🐵=I` (starting sentences with \"I\").\n4. `🤖=o` (fits \"world\").\n5. `🦆=c` (fits \"concept\").\n\nUpdated guesses:  \n`🐵=I, 👽=n, 🦆=c, 🤭=g, 🐨=t, 🦁=h, 🤖=o, 🐶=r, 🐻=d`\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:  \nAnswer: 🐵=I, 👽=n, 🦆=c, 🤭=g, 🐨=t, 🦁=h, 🤖=o, 🐶=r, 🐻=d","To deduce the encoded sentence, let's consolidate the hints and feedback from prior guesses:\n\n### Fixed letters based on hints and correct guesses:\n1. 👽 = n (given hint)\n2. 🦁 = h (confirmed correct)\n3. 🐶 = r (confirmed correct)\n4. 🐻 = d (confirmed correct)\n\n### Feedback insights:\nFrom prior guesses, these emojis were consistently marked as incorrect: 🐵, 🦆, 🤭, 🐨, and 🤖. Therefore, we need to reassign these emojis to new guesses.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. Focus on replacing incorrect guesses with plausible remaining letters based on context.\n2. The encoded sentence ends with punctuation (`.`), so the encoded structure resembles actual English syntax.\n3.

From **hint**: `👽=n` is already known.\n2. From **feedback**:\n   - `🦁=h`, `🐻=d`, `🐶=r` are consistently marked **correct**.\n   - `🐵`, `🦆`, `🤭`, `🐨`, `🤖` are consistently **incorrect** guesses so far and need new values.\n\n### Step 2: Hypothesize Remaining Mappings\n\n#### Encoded Sentence:  \n🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\n\n#### Revealed Information:\n- Hint: `👽=n`\n- Mapping known so far: `🦁=h`, `🐻=d`, `🐶=r`\n\n#### Observations:\n1. The structure of the encoded sentence suggests the following patterns:\n   - `🐵.` suggests a single-letter token. The only single letters in English are **A** or **I**. Since `🐵` consistently fails as **A** and **I**, it should represent something else. I hypothesize `🐵=T` for now.\n   - `i👽🦆🤭l🦆e` starts with `\"in\"`, so intuitively, it could mean `\"inside\"`. I'll update guesses accordingly.\n   - Other frequently observed patterns like `t🦁e` likely map to common phrases like `\"the\"`.\n\n#### Updated Guesses:\n- `🐵=T`, `🦆=s`, `🤭=i`, `🐨=d`, `🤖=o`\n\n#### Full mapping so far:\n`🐵=T, 👽=n, 🦆=s, 🤭=i, 🐨=d, 🦁=h, 🤖=o, 🐶=r, 🐻=d`\n\n### Step 3: Reconstruct and Verify\nReconstructing the sentence with these mappings:\n\n**Encoded Sentence**:  \nT. s. inside it the word comes to ond end.  \n(Expected meaningful sentence!)\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 🐵=T, 👽=n, 🦆=s, 🤭=i, 🐨=d, 🦁=h, 🤖=o, 🐶=r, 🐻=d","Let's analyze the results provided:\n\n### Observations from Feedback:\n1.

The rest of the emoji-letter mappings were incorrect every time:\n   - `🐵` remains unsolved, but it is never correct across attempts.\n   - `🦆` remains unsolved—it is incorrect across all attempts.\n   - `🤭` remains unsolved—it is incorrect across all attempts.\n   - `🐨` remains unsolved—it is incorrect across all attempts.\n   - `🤖` remains unsolved—it is incorrect across all attempts.\n\n3.

From Attempt 3:\n   - 🥴=e, 🐮=t, 🥳=h, 🐭=c, 🐨=o, 🐱=a are correct.\n   - 🐯=d is incorrect.\n\n4. From Attempt 4:\n   - 🥴=e, 🐮=t, 🥳=h, 🐭=c, 🐨=o, 🐱=a are correct.\n   - 🐯=s is incorrect.\n\n5. From Attempt 5:\n   - 🥴=e, 🐮=t, 🥳=h, 🐭=c, 🐨=o, 🐱=a, 🐯=l are correct.\n   - 🥺=y, 🦆=p, 🤩=m are incorrect.\n\nConsidering the feedback and encoded sentence, let's use this information to progress logically.\n\n### Summary of Assigned Values:\n- 🥴=e (confirmed in all attempts)\n- 🐮=t (confirmed in all attempts)\n- 🥳=h (confirmed in all attempts)\n- 🐭=c (confirmed in all attempts)\n- 🐨=o (confirmed in all attempts)\n- 🐱=a (confirmed since Attempt 3)\n- 🐯=l (confirmed in Attempt 5)\n- 🥺 remains incorrect, needing reassignment.\n- 🦆 remains incorrect, needing reassignment.\n- 🤩 remains incorrect, needing reassignment.\n\n### Next Step:\nAssign new guesses to 🥺, 🦆, and 🤩 based on frequency analysis or structural patterns in the encoded sentence.\n\n### Guesses for Attempt 6:\n1. 🥺: Based on the encoded sentence structure, 🥺 might align with \"n\" as it's a common letter in many words.\n2. 🦆: Might correspond to \"u\" based on contextual frequency.\n3. 🤩: Might correspond to \"g\" (as guessed earlier, but was wrong in a different spot).\n\n### Answer:\n🥴=e, 🐮=t, 🥳=h, 🐭=c, 🐨=o, 🐱=a, 🐯=l, 🥺=n, 🦆=u, 🤩=g\n\nAnswer: 🥴=e,🐮=t,🥳=h,🐭=c,🐨=o,🐱=a,🐯=l,🥺=n,🦆=u,🤩=g","### Step 1: Assess the Current Game State\nFrom the encoded sentence, hints, and history above, here's what we know so far:\n\n#### Hints and Correct Assignments:\n- 🥴 = e ✅\n- 🐮 = t ✅\n- 🥳 = h ✅\n- 🐭 = c ✅\n- 🐨 = o ✅\n- 🐱 = a ✅\n- 🐯 = l ✅\n\n#### Incorrect Assignments:\n- 🦆 is not r, p, or u.\n- 🥺 is not l, m, y, or n.\n- 🤩 is not s, g, or m.\n\n#### Encoded Sentence So Far:\nUsing the known assignments, we can partially decode the encoded sentence:\n```\na l t o g e t h e r, t h e c o n s t e l l a t i o n c o n t a i n s a 🥺o u t 50 g a l a x i e s o 🥺e s e r🤩a🥺 l e t e r 🥺u g h a 🦆a t e u r t e l 🐭o p e.\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify Logical Patterns\n1. Consider 🥺:\n   - Based on the context, 🥺 often follows vowels and consonants (e.g., \"a 🥺o u t\" or \"g a l a x i e s o 🥺e\").\n   - Possible guesses could include `w` or `v`.\n\n2. Consider 🦆:\n   - From the partially decoded phrase \"a 🦆a t e,\" this suggests 🦆 might be something like `d`.\n\n3. Consider 🤩:\n   - From the partially decoded \"e r🤩a🥺,\" 🤩 follows `e r` and precedes `a`. This positioning could indicate a possible guess of `v`.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Make the Next Guess\nTo clarify unknowns and stick to phonetic plausibility:\n- Guess for 🥺 = y (e.g., \"galaxies only\").\n- Guess for 🦆 = d (e.g., \"a data tour\").\n- Guess for 🤩 = v (e.g., \"every galaxy\").\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Format the Answer\nAnswer: 🥴=e,🐮=t,🥳=h,🐭=c,🐨=o,🐱=a,🐯=l,🥺=y,🦆=d,🤩=v","Let's analyze the given data:\n\n### Decipher Using History and Feedback:\n1. **Confirmed Matches**:\n   - 🥴 = e\n   - 🐮 = t\n   - 🥳 = h\n   - 🐭 = c\n   - 🐨 = o\n   - 🐱 = a\n   - 🐯 = l\n   - 🤩 = v\n\n2. **To Be Determined**:\n   - 🥺\n   - 🦆\n\n### Processed Encoded Sentence\nUsing the confirmed matches:\n```\n🐱🐯🐮🐨g🥴🐮🥳🥴r, 🐮🥳🥴 🐭🐨ns🐮🥴🐯🐯🐱🐮i🐨n 🐭🐨n🐮🐱ins 🐱🥺🐨u🐮 50 g🐱🐯🐱xi🥴s 🐨🥺s🥴r🤩🐱🥺🐯🥴 🐮🥳r🐨ug🥳 🐱🦆🐱🐮🥴ur 🐮🥴🐯🥴s🐭🐨p🥴.\n```\nReplace all confirmed emojis:\n```\naaltoethr, the co nsoethllati oncntains anytun 50 galaxes ovs ylv alyther th vogh aur terl p.\n```\n\n### Observations:\n- 🥺 appears to correspond to **y** based on the word \"anyt**u**n\" and \"ylv\".\n- 🦆 appears to correspond to **u** based on the incomplete words and patterns like \"aur\".\n\n### New Guess:\nBased on the feedback and observations:\n- 🥴 = e\n- 🐮 = t\n- 🥳 = h\n- 🐭 = c\n- 🐨 = o\n- 🐱 = a\n- 🐯 = l\n- 🥺 = y\n- 🦆 = u\n- 🤩 = v\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 🥴=e,🐮=t,🥳=h,🐭=c,🐨=o,🐱=a,🐯=l,🥺=y,🦆=u,🤩=v","Let's carefully assess the hints and feedback to make an informed guess for this round.\n\n### Current Known Emoji-Decodings:\n1. 🥴 = e (hint provided)\n2. 🐮 = t (correct based on feedback)\n3. 🥳 = h (correct based on feedback)\n4. 🐭 = c (correct based on feedback)\n5. 🐨 = o (correct based on feedback)\n6. 🐱 = a (correct based on feedback)\n7. 🐯 = l (correct based on feedback)\n8. 🤩 = v (correct based on feedback)\n\n### Remaining Unsolved Emoji:\n1. 🥺\n2. 🦆\n\n### Reasoning:\nFrom the History:\n- 🥺 has been guessed as \"y,\" \"n,\" \"m,\" but all were wrong.\n- 🦆 has been guessed as \"r,\" \"p,\" \"u,\" \"d,\" but all were wrong.\n\nGiven the encoded sentence context and the process of elimination, let's try new guesses for 🥺 and 🦆:\n\n### Final Guess for This Round:\n1. 🥺 = i (a common vowel after elimination of others)\n2. 🦆 = b (logical guess for a consonant not tried yet)\n\n### Full Answer:\nAnswer: 🥴=e,🐮=t,🥳=h,🐭=c,🐨=o,🐱=a,🐯=l,🤩=v,🥺=i,🦆=b","### Step 1: Analyze the provided data\nFrom the encoded message, certain emojis have already been correctly decoded, and others are in the feedback phase.

This means we need to try new letters for these.\n\n### Previous Incorrect Guesses for the Variables:\n- 🐶 has been guessed as **p, o, m, f, t** and all are incorrect.\n- 🙄 has been guessed as **w, h, y, u, k** and all are incorrect.\n- 😇 has been guessed as **e, c, i, i, o** and all are incorrect.\n- 😂 has been guessed as **d, s, g, l, l** and all are incorrect.\n\n### Logical Approach:\n1. Since 🐶 hasn't matched with any guess yet, we need to try a new letter. Next possible candidate could be **b**.\n2. Similarly, try new letters for 🙄, 😇, and 😂:\n   - 🙄: Candidates include **j**.\n   - 😇: Candidates include **a**.\n   - 😂: Candidates include **u**.\n\n### Updated Guess:\n- 😍=r, 🐵=v, 💩=n, 🐶=b, 🙄=j, 😇=a, 😂=u.\n\n### Answer Format:\nAnswer: 😍=r,🐵=v,💩=n,🐶=b,🙄=j,😇=a,😂=u","### Step 1: Analyze the History\nBased on the provided history and feedback:\n- 😍 = r (confirmed from all attempts)\n- 🐵 = v (confirmed)\n- 💩 = n (confirmed)\n- 🐶, 🙄, 😇, and 😂 remain undeciphered.\n\n### Step 2: Eliminate Incorrect Guesses\n- Previous guesses for 🐶: (p, o, m, f, t, b) - all incorrect.\n- Previous guesses for 🙄: (w, h, y, u, k, j) - all incorrect.\n- Previous guesses for 😇: (e, c, i, i, o, a) - all incorrect.\n- Previous guesses for 😂: (d, s, g, l, l, u) - all incorrect.\n\n### Step 3: Formulate New Guesses for 🐶, 🙄, 😇, and 😂\nBased on the hints provided, we'll try new plausible letter mappings while keeping the confirmed mappings (😍 = r, 🐵 = v, 💩 = n) intact. Following the patterns and attempting unused consonants or vowels:\n\n1. 🐶 = c (untried; appearing often, possibly a consonant such as \"c\").\n2. 🙄 = q (untried; plausible filler consonant).\n3. 😇 = i (retrying due to common word formations, though unconfirmed earlier).\n4. 😂 = h (untried; consistent with sentence structure).\n\n### Step 4: Submit New Guess\n```\nAnswer: 😍=r,🐵=v,💩=n,🐶=c,🙄=q,😇=i,😂=h\n```","Let's analyze the information and provide an educated guess based on the game's hints and feedback.\n\n### Analysis of History:\n1.

Here are the facts we currently know:\n\n1. The emoji `😍` represents the letter `r`. This has been confirmed in all attempts.\n2. The emoji `🐵` represents the letter `v`. This has also been confirmed in all attempts.\n3. The emoji `💩` represents the letter `n`. This is confirmed too.\n4. All other guesses for `🐶`, `🙄`, `😇`, and `😂` have been incorrect in every attempt so far.\n\n### Strategy:\n- The emojis `🐶`, `🙄`, `😇`, and `😂` must have new letter assignments, as guesses for these have consistently been wrong.\n- The valid letters remaining for these emojis should exclude letters already used (`r`, `v`, `n`), as well as letters that have previously been guessed and found incorrect.\n- The encoded sentence resembles an intelligible English sentence. Word structure and frequency of letters can help guide guesses for the remaining mappings:\n  - Most frequently appearing emojis (apart from the revealed `😍`, `🐵`, and `💩`) can be associated with commonly used letters like `t`, `e`, `h`, etc.\n  - Words like \"the\" or \"by\" often appear in sentences and provide clues.\n\n### Observing the Encoded Sentence:\n- Key repeated emojis:\n  - `🐶` appears frequently; it might represent `t`, `s`, or another high-frequency consonant.\n  - `😇` could represent a vowel like `i` or `o`.\n  - `🙄` might correspond to `h` or `y` based on sentence structure around small words like \"by\".\n  - `😂` might be a consonant like `l` or `s`.\n\n### Educated Guess:\nSince `🐶`, `🙄`, `😇`, and `😂` need new assignments, I will assign them as:\n- `🐶=t` (common expectations for frequently recurring letters).\n- `🙄=h` (common in short, connecting words).\n- `😇=i` (frequent vowel in English).\n- `😂=l` (another frequent consonant).\n\n### Guess:\nBased on this reasoning:\n- 😍=r (hint provided)\n- 🐵=v (confirmed)\n- 💩=n (confirmed)\n- 🐶=t\n- 🙄=h\n- 😇=i\n- 😂=l\n\n### Output:\nAnswer: 😍=r,🐵=v,💩=n,🐶=t,🙄=h,😇=i,😂=l","### Step 1: Analyze the Information\nFrom the encoding process, we know the following positive feedback based on the history:\n\n- 😍 corresponds to **r**.\n- 🐵 corresponds to **v**.\n- 💩 corresponds to **n**.\n\nNone of the other guessed mappings for 🐶, 🙄, 😇, or 😂 worked in any of the previous 9 attempts.

Below is the analysis and initial guess based on the given encoded sentence and hint.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The encoded sentence is:\n  `🤫🤩🤫🤩a wa🤗 an 🐷🐔😴🤩rtant 🤫🤩🐔🐔🤩🐯🐷t😂 🐷n 😴r🤥-🤫🤩l🐦🐔🙄🐷an 🐔🤥🤗🤩a🐔🤥r🐷🤫a.`\n- A hint is provided: `🤩=o`.\n\n### Observations:\n1. The most frequent emoji `🤩` (already revealed as 'o') appears often in the encoded text.\n2. The long word \"🐷🐔😴🤩rtant\" could correspond to \"important\" since \"o\" appears in the correct position and the word makes sense contextually.\n3. The word \"🤫🤩🤫🤩a\" starts and ends with the same emoji (🤫), suggesting it could be \"moma\" or \"coca\".\n4. We've identified some patterns, and we'll make educated guesses from these clues.\n\n### Guesses (Hypotheses):\n- 🤩=o (provided by Hint)\n- 🤫=m (\"🤫🤩🤫🤩a\" becomes \"moma,\" which could be \"moma.\")\n- 🐷=p (\"🐷🐔😴🤩rtant\" could map to \"important.\")\n- 🐔=r (\"🐷🐔😴🤩rtant\" becomes \"important.\")\n- 😴=t (\"🐷🐔😴🤩rtant\" becomes \"important.\")\n\n### Initial Answer Submission:\nAnswer: 🤩=o, 🤫=m, 🐷=p, 🐔=r, 😴=t","### Step 1: Decode using the feedback:\nFrom the feedback after the first guess:\n- 🤩=o is confirmed correct.\n- 🤫, 🐷, 🐔, and 😴 are incorrect guesses.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the encoded sentence:\nEncoded Sentence: 🤫🤩🤫🤩a wa🤗 an 🐷🐔😴🤩rtant 🤫🤩🐔🐔🤩🐯🐷t😂 🐷n 😴r🤥-🤫🤩l🐦🐔🙄🐷an 🐔🤥🤗🤩a🐔🤥r🐷🤫a.\n\n**Current Hint:** 🤩 = o  \n🤩 already appears multiple times in the sentence, so it's likely filling 'o' in significant places (e.g., 'important' or 'of').\n\n### Step 3: Reconsider possibilities for other emojis:\nFrom the provided encoded sentence and feedback:\n1. 🐷 might represent a vowel (since it appears frequently); try 'a' or 'e'.\n2. 🐔 might be a consonant (used often but coupled with other emojis).\n3. 🤫 could be a consonant or a vowel—test with context, possibly a letter like 'm' (failed guess earlier but could relate to 'important').\n4. 😴 and other emojis: examine common English letter combinations and context.\n\nLet’s hypothesize and cross-reference these potential matches:\n- 🤫 = m (Retry this based on structure \"mo\" in certain words).\n- 🐷 = e (Considering common vowel distribution, 'important').\n- 🐔 = r (Retry a common consonant guess).\n- 😴 = t (Retry as used frequently tracted part structural placing)\n\n### Step 4: Revise the Guess for Attempt:\nHypothetical mappings:\n🤩 = o (confirmed hint), 🤫 = m, 🐷 = e, 🐔 = r, 😴 = t.\n\n**Final output for this attempt:**\nAnswer: 🤩=o, 🤫=m, 🐷=e, 🐔=r, 😴=t","We are tasked with determining the letter\/word each emoji represents based on feedback from your previous guesses and the hint provided. Let's analyze the data:\n\n### Information Analysis:\n1. **Hint:** 🤩 = o (this must be included in our answer).\n2. **History Feedback:**\n   - For Attempt 1: 🤩=o was correct, but 🤫=m, 🐷=p, 🐔=r, 😴=t were all incorrect.\n   - For Attempt 2: 🤩=o was again correct, but 🤫=m, 🐷=e, 🐔=r, 😴=t were all incorrect.\n\nFrom this, we know the correct mapping of 🤩 is **o**, and must change other mappings as 🤫, 🐷, 🐔, and 😴 were disproven twice.\n\n### Strategy Moving Forward:\n- Consider alternative guesses for emojis 🤫, 🐷, 🐔, 😴 based on their placement in the sentence and feedback provided.\n\nEncoded sentence for reference:\n\"🤫🤩🤫🤩a wa🤗 an 🐷🐔😴🤩rtant 🤫🤩🐔🐔🤩🐯🐷t😂 🐷n 😴r🤥-🤫🤩l🐦🐔🙄🐷an 🐔🤥🤗🤩a🐔🤥r🐷🤫a.\"\n\n#### Attempt 3 Guesses:\nI'll try assigning new plausible letters to these emojis:\n\n- 🤩 = o (confirmed from hint).  \n- 🤫 = i (likely starts like \"important\" → \"io\").  \n- 🐷 = m (may fit \"important\").  \n- 🐔 = p (\"mp\" from \"important\" suggests 🐔 = p).  \n- 😴 = r (\"rt\" from \"important\" suggests 😴 = r).\n\n### Revised Guess Submission:\nAnswer: 🤩=o, 🤫=i, 🐷=m, 🐔=p, 😴=r","To solve this, let's carefully analyze the feedback and history to infer the correct mapping for each emoji. \n\nWe know from the Hint and Feedback:\n- 🤩=o is correct.\n- 🤫, 🐷, 🐔, 😴 have all been incorrect in every different guessed letter based on the feedback. \n\n### Time to revise our guesses based on previous mistakes\n- 🤫 could be any letter except m or i (per earlier guesses).\n- 🐷 could be any letter except p or e (per earlier guesses).\n- 🐔 could be any letter except r or p (per earlier guesses).\n- 😴 could be any letter except t or r (per earlier guesses).\n\nLet’s make a new guess based on the pattern of the sentence:\n\"🤫🤩🤫🤩a wa🤗 an 🐷🐔😴🤩rtant 🤫🤩🐔🐔🤩🐯🐷t😂 🐷n 😴r🤥-🤫🤩l🐦🐔🙄🐷an 🐔🤥🤗🤩a🐔🤥r🐷🤫a.\"\n\n---\n\nFrom the structure of the encoded sentence, it seems likely that:\n- 🤫 could be a vowel since it repeats frequently at the beginning and occurs in positions where vowels typically appear. Likely candidates are \"a\", \"e\", \"i\", or \"u\". Since \"i\" has been tried, let’s try \"a\".\n- 🐷 could also be a vowel or a consonant. \"m\" and \"e\" have already been eliminated, so let's try \"s\".\n- 🐔 occurs right before \"😴\" and could represent a common consonant in this positioning. Let’s try \"n\".\n- 😴 appears in words where \"o\" (🤩) already exists, so it may be another consonant. Let’s try \"g\".\n\n### New Guess:\n- 🤩=o (hint provided)\n- 🤫=a\n- 🐷=s\n- 🐔=n\n- 😴=g\n\n### Final Output:\nAnswer: 🤩=o, 🤫=a, 🐷=s, 🐔=n, 😴=g","Let's analyze the task and the existing feedback to make a proper guess.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. 🤩 = o (confirmed).\n2. Previous guesses for 🤫 (m, i, a) are incorrect.\n3. Previous guesses for 🐷 (p, e, m, s) are incorrect.\n4. Previous guesses for 🐔 (r, r, p, n) are incorrect.\n5. Previous guesses for 😴 (t, t, r, g) are incorrect.\n\n### Strategy:\nWe need to find new potential guesses for 🤫, 🐷, 🐔, and 😴 because all prior guesses for these emojis have been confirmed as wrong. The encoded sentence has a structure similar to English and must make logical sense.\n\n#### Encoded Sentence with 🤩 resolved:\no o o o a wa🤗 an 🐷🐔😴o␣rtant o🐔🐔🐯🐷t😂 🐷n 😴r🤥-o🐦🐔🙄🐷an 🐔🤥🤗oo🐔🤥r🐷oa.\n\n1. 🤫 likely encodes a vowel given its frequent occurrence in the sentence. Since 'a' and 'o' are taken, it could be 'e', 'i', or 'u'.\n2. 🐷 might encode a consonant in contexts like \"wa🐷,\" \"🐷🐔,\" and \"🐷an\". Likely candidates could be 'l', 'd', or 'c'.\n3. 🐔 appears in sequences like \"🐷🐔,\" \"🐔🐔,\" and \"🐔🤥\". It might encode 'n', 't', or 'h'.\n4. 😴 likely appears in context like \"😴r\" and \"🐷n 😴r\". This could point to 'b', 'd', or 'f'.\n\n### Updated Guess:\n- 🤫 = e (common vowel hypothesis, remaining likely option).\n- 🐷 = l.\n- 🐔 = t.\n- 😴 = b.\n\n---\n\n### Final Guess for This Attempt:\nAnswer: 🤩=o, 🤫=e, 🐷=l, 🐔=t, 😴=b.","### Analysis:\n1. The encrypted sentence is provided along with feedback for each guess about which mappings are correct or incorrect.\n2. The hint specifies that 🤩 corresponds to the letter \"o\".\n3. All guesses so far, except for 🤩=o, have been incorrect.\n4. We need to derive new mappings while keeping 🤩=o consistent, and avoid previously guessed incorrect mappings.\n\n### Strategy:\nTo eliminate guesses already marked as incorrect:\n- 🤫 cannot be \"m\", \"i\", \"a\", or \"e\". The next potential guess for 🤫 could be \"c\".\n- 🐷 cannot be \"p\", \"e\", \"m\", \"s\", or \"l\". A reasonable next guess might try \"d\".\n- 🐔 cannot be \"r\", \"n\", \"p\", or \"t\". A plausible option could be \"k\".\n- 😴 cannot be \"t\", \"r\", \"g\", or \"b\". A potential alternative might be \"v\".\n\n### Proposed Guess:\nLet’s proceed with 🤩=o (the confirmed hint), 🤫=c, 🐷=d, 🐔=k, 😴=v.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 🤩=o, 🤫=c, 🐷=d, 🐔=k, 😴=v","### Step 1: Analyze the History and Feedback\nThe hint indicates that 🤩=o.\n\nFrom the latest attempt:\n- 🤩=o is correct.\n- 🤫=c is correct.\n- 🐷=d, 🐔=k, and 😴=v are incorrect.\n\nBased on the history so far, we know:\n1. 🤩=o is consistently correct.\n2. 🤫=c is now confirmed correct.\n3. 🐷, 🐔, and 😴 need updated guesses.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Make New Guesses\nThe partially decoded sentence so far is:\n```\n🤫🤩🤫🤩a wa🤗 an 🐷🐔😴🤩rtant 🤫🤩🐔🐔🤩🐯🐷t😂 🐷n 😴r🤥-🤫🤩l🐦🐔🙄🐷an 🐔🤥🤗🤩a🐔🤥r🐷🤫a.\n```\nSubstituting 🤫=c and 🤩=o:\n```\ncocoa wa🤗 an 🐷🐔😴ortant coco🐔🐔o🐯🐷t😂 🐷n 😴rc-colo🐦🐔🙄🐷an 🐔🤥🤗oa🐔🤥r🐷ca.\n```\nNow, we need updated guesses for 🐷, 🐔, and 😴 (the frequent ones) based on contextual clues.\n\n#### Analyzing Patterns:\n- \"cocoa\" suggests a wordplay on something with double \"c\" and \"o\" pairs in the sentence.\n- The word \"an 🐷🐔😴ortant\" hints that this may be \"an important,\" so 🐷=i, 🐔=m, and 😴=p can be tried.\n- Similarly, in \"coco🐔🐔o🐯🐷t😂\": 🐯 could be \"n,\" and 😂 could be \"e,\" forming potential longer words.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Submit Guesses\nNew guesses based on analysis:\n- 🐷=i (might construct \"important\")\n- 🐔=m (fits contextually in words like \"important\" and \"colom\")\n- 😴=p (important needs \"p\")\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Format the Answer\n```\nAnswer: 🤩=o, 🤫=c, 🐷=i, 🐔=m, 😴=p\n```","To solve this puzzle, I will use the information from the encoded sentence, the hint, and the feedback history.

The next task will involve decoding the other elements (e.g., 🤗, 😂, 🤥, 🐯, 🙄, 🐦) based on logical guessing of the sentence structure.\n\nFor now, with the given feedback, the answer to this round is:\nAnswer: 🤩=o, 🤫=c, 🐷=i, 🐔=m, 😴=p","We can now decode the encoded sentence using the correct letter mappings from the game history.

The hint reveals \"🤖\" = \"e.\" Wherever \"🤖\" appears in the encoded sentence, it translates to \"e.\"\n2. Currently, we don't have enough information to proceed further, so I will make educated guesses based on common sentence structures and try to decode more emojis.\n\n3. Observing patterns:\n   - 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 (5 emojis): This could be a 5-letter word starting with the letter \"e\" at the fourth position.\n   - 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 appears again later—repeated words are often conjunctions, pronouns, or common verbs.\n   - 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦: This is much longer than a single word—likely a multi-word part of the sentence.\n\n4. Common sentence endings, years, and structure:\n   - \"23 🤮👽🙄🤖🐵🐷🤖😇 2007\": 2007 is a year; this structure might resemble something related to time or events.\n\n### First Guess:\n\nI will decode based on \"🤖=e\" and common patterns:\n\nAnswer: 🤖=e.","Given the information provided, let's work through the puzzle systematically.\n\n### Current Information:\n#### Encoded Sentence:\n🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦 🐱🐦 😱🤮 😱🐶🐦🐸😇😱🐧🐱😱🤮 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸 🦆🐔😱🐱🤮 👽🤓🤮🤖🥵 🐷🐨 🤓🤖🐦🦉😱😇🐵🤖😇🐦 (🦉👽😇🐵🤖😇🐧🐨 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 🐻😇👽🐶😍 🐷🤖🦉👽😇🤖 🐱🐸🐦 😱🦆🦁🐶🐱🐦🐱🐸🐱👽🤮 👽🤮 23 🤮👽🙄🤖🐵🐷🤖😇 2007).\n\n#### Hint:\n🤖 = e (confirmed information).\n\n#### History:\n1. First guess was 🤖 = e, and feedback said {'🤖': False} (meaning 🤖 doesn't represent 'e'). \n\nWe can use this data to reevaluate the encoded sentence and try deducing other characters systematically.\n\n---\n\n### New Guesses:\nFor this attempt, we might need to try other combinations and keep 🤖 (incorrect in round 1) active in our guess. Since 🤖 doesn’t equal ‘e’, 🤖 could be something else in future interpretation.\n\nEffort guess toward-----\n","Based on your input, the encoded sentence is given, and the hint reveals that 🤖 corresponds to \"e.\" You also mentioned that this hint feedback from previous history indicates that \"🤖=e\" was incorrect. Thus, we need to formulate guesses in this second attempt using this updated feedback and any patterns observed in the sentence.\n\n---\n\n### Observation from the encoded sentence:\n1. The encoded emojis seem to follow a consistent pattern where some may repeat more often (e.g., 🐦, 🤖, 😇), suggesting common letters.\n2. Certain sections of the text in parentheses likely refer to dates and numbers (e.g., \"23 2007\"), which could help decode pairs of emojis.\n\n### Strategy:\n- Use common letter positions in English words (e.g., \"e\", \"a\", \"t\", etc.).\n- The decoded word must contain repeated emojis that make logical sense based on prior feedback and the frequency of emojis.\n\n---\n\n### Guesses:\nFor this round, I will match the hint (🤖≠e) and attempt other logical correspondence for words.\n\nNew guesses:\n- 🦆=s\n- 👽=t\n- 🐧=h\n- 🤖=a\n- 🐦=i\n- 🐶=n\n- 😍=d\n- 😇=o\n- 🐵=r\n- 😱=w\n- 🤮=u\n- 🤠=c\n- 🐸=l\n- 🐱=y\n- 🐔=g\n- 🤓=m\n- 🥵=p\n- 🐷=k\n- 🐨=v\n- 🦉=f\n- 🦁=b\n- 🐻=q\n- 🙄=x\n\n---\n\n### Final Response:\nAnswer: 🦆=s, 👽=t, 🐧=h, 🤖=a, 🐦=i, 🐶=n, 😍=d, 😇=o, 🐵=r, 😱=w, 🤮=u, 🤠=c, 🐸=l, 🐱=y, 🐔=g, 🤓=m, 🥵=p, 🐷=k, 🐨=v, 🦉=f, 🦁=b, 🐻=q, 🙄=x","**Step 1: Analyze Your Task and Feedback**  \nIn the Crypto Word Game, we analyze the feedback given for previous attempts.

Based on the hint that 💩=e, and analyzing the encoded sentence, I'll make my initial guesses based on the known relationships and patterns in English grammar.\n\n---\n\n### Observation:\n- 💩=e (Hint provided)\n- Common patterns: **'cc'** is likely \"ee\" as it's a double letter, frequently found in English words such as \"need\" and \"seen.\"\n- Words like \"**t💩🐰🤑**\" likely start with \"te+\" based on 💩=e.\n- **🤗🐶🐰🤮** could be a word like \"they,\" knowing \"the\" is common in sentences starting with \"t.\"\n- **t🐭💩** could be \"tee\" or \"ten,\" but \"ten\" is more common.\n\n---\n\n### Guesses:\nI'll assign letters to the emojis using English word patterns and the given hint.\n\n1. 🐰=h (e.g., \"the\")\n2. 🐶=t (e.g., \"they\" or \"content\")\n3. 🤑=r (e.g., \"there\" or \"their\")\n4. 🐭=n (e.g., \"ten\" or \"net\")\n5. 😂=o (e.g., \"content\" or \"on\")\n6. 🧐=n (e.g., \"content\")\n7. 🤗=y (e.g., \"they\")\n8. 🤮=y (e.g., \"they\" or \"every\")\n9. 🥵=s (e.g., \"essence\")\n10. 🙄=a (e.g., \"mean\" or \"seat\")\n11. 🐵=m (e.g., \"mean\" or \"team\")\n12. 🤥=d (e.g., \"ended\")\n\n---\n\n### Explanation:\nThe sentence roughly decodes as:\n\"fhere ten they there content ten there contentness army everyended.\"\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer for Attempt 1:\nAnswer: 💩=e, 🐰=h, 🐶=t, 🤑=r, 🐭=n, 😂=o, 🧐=n, 🤗=y, 🤮=y, 🥵=s, 🙄=a, 🐵=m, 🤥=d","### Step 1: Analyze the game board and rules\n\nFrom the provided hint and feedback:\n\n- Hint: 💩=e (this is confirmed as true)\n- Feedback for previous guesses: \n  - 💩=e (correct)\n  - Other guesses like 🐰=h, 🐶=t, etc., were all incorrect.\n\n### Step 2: Use feedback to refine guessing\n\nSince the previous guesses for other emojis were incorrect, we'll choose a new potential mapping for these emojis. We'll use the structure of the encoded sentence to guide our guesses.\n\nEncoded Sentence:  \n```\nf🐰🐶🤑 t🐭💩 🤗🐶🐰🤮 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt t🐭💩 t💩🐰🤑 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nc🥵 🙄🐵 🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮.\n```\n\nThe following observations can help:\n\n1. **💩=e** has been confirmed.

The pattern \"😂cc🐶\" looks like it could represent \"occurrence\" or \"account\" due to \"cc\". We'll guess 😂=o.\n\n3. **t🐭e** - Let's try \"the\", which suggests 🐭=h.\n\n4. Looking at \"🙄🐵\" near the end, \"am\" seems a reasonable guess, so 🙄=a and 🐵=m.\n\n5. \"🤗🐶🐰🤮\" appears after \"the\", suggesting \"they\" or \"that\". We'll guess 🐶=h, 🐰=y, and 🤮=y.\n\n6. Finally, \"t💩🐰🤑\" might represent \"ther\" (context of \"there\" or \"their\"), so 🤑=r.\n\n### Step 3: Submit a new guess\nNow, we compile a new set of guesses based on the above reasoning, including 💩=e:\n\n```\n💩=e, 🐰=y, 🐶=h, 🤑=r, 🐭=h, 😂=o, 🧐=n, 🤗=t, 🤮=y, 🥵=s, 🙄=a, 🐵=m, 🤥=d\n```\n\n### Final Answer:\n```\nAnswer: 💩=e, 🐰=y, 🐶=h, 🤑=r, 🐭=h, 😂=o, 🧐=n, 🤗=t, 🤮=y, 🥵=s, 🙄=a, 🐵=m, 🤥=d\n```","### Game Solution\n\nFrom **Hint** and **History**:\n- 💩=e (True from Hint and History)\n- 🐭=h (True from History)\n\nLooking at the feedback on the prior attempts:\n1. 💩=e, 🐭=h are the only confirmed correct values.\n2. All others need to be adjusted since they were marked as False.\n\n### Strategy:\nBased on a standard approach to decoding encoded sentences:\n1. Identify emojis that frequently occur with known correct characters and try plausible substitutions (e.g., common letters like vowels or frequently appearing consonants).\n2. Revisit substitution guesses systematically based on feedback.\n\n### Updated Guess:\nAfter analyzing, the updated guess attempts to fit common words that make sense within the encoded sentence structure.\n\n- 💩=e (Hint, confirmed correct)\n- 🐭=h (Confirmed correct from History)\n- 🐰=a (new guess)\n- 🐶=t (new guess)\n- 🤑=r (new guess)\n- 😂=o (new guess)\n- 🧐=n (new guess)\n- 🤗=y (new guess)\n- 🤮=i (new guess)\n- 🥵=s (new guess)\n- 🙄=c (new guess)\n- 🐵=m (new guess)\n- 🤥=d (new guess)\n\n### Final Answer Format:\nAnswer: 💩=e,🐭=h,🐰=a,🐶=t,🤑=r,😂=o,🧐=n,🤗=y,🤮=i,🥵=s,🙄=c,🐵=m,🤥=d","To solve this round, let's analyze the feedback.

Let's test another vowel like \"a\".\n- 🤑 remains undeciphered, and previous guesses \"r\", \"s\", and \"t\" failed. Try \"c\" (since it's likely part of a repeated pattern).\n- 😂 failed with \"o\", \"t\", \"l\", and \"r\". We could try \"i\".\n- 🧐 failed with \"n\", \"g\", \"c\". Try \"d\".\n- 🤗 failed with \"y\", \"t\", \"a\". Let's try \"u\".\n- 🤮 failed with \"u\", \"y\", \"i\". Let's test \"a\".\n- 🙄 hasn't worked with \"a\", \"c\", or \"t\". Try \"s\".\n- 🐵 hasn't worked with \"m\", \"g\", or \"p\". Try \"k\".\n- 🤥 hasn't worked with \"d\", \"l\", or \"s\". Try \"v\".\n\nBased on this analysis, my next set of guesses is as follows:\n\n---\n\n### Guess #8\n💩=e, 🐭=h, 🐰=a, 🐶=o, 🤑=c, 😂=i, 🧐=d, 🤗=u, 🤮=a, 🥵=y, 🙄=s, 🐵=k, 🤥=v\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 💩=e,🐭=h,🐰=a,🐶=o,🤑=c,😂=i,🧐=d,🤗=u,🤮=a,🥵=y,🙄=s,🐵=k,🤥=v","To solve this, let's analyze the history and make educated guesses based on the feedback received at each step. I'll combine the correct prior answers and adjust the incorrect guesses to move closer to a correct solution.\n\n### Observations from Feedback:\n1. 💩=e, 🐭=h, 🐶=o, and 🥵=y have been consistently correct, so we'll keep these.\n2. 🤥=v was correct as per the last guess.\n3. Other emojis need to be reassigned intelligently based on elimination and logical word formation.\n\n### Updating the Guesses:\n1. The word \"content\" appears as part of the encoded sentence. A close match here starts with 🐶=o (which is correct), and 🤥=v (also confirmed). We'll aim to map the rest of \"content\" accordingly.\n2.

Thus, we should assign a new plausible letter for 🐰.\n2. 🤑, 😂, 🧐, 🤗, 🤮, 🙄, 🐵, and 🐰 need new evaluations as previous guesses for these emoji were incorrect.\n\n### Process of elimination and logical deductions:\n- Since many emoji have been tested without success, we should consider uncommon vowels (like \"a\") for 🐰 since it's being repeatedly rejected as part of the answer for consonants.\n- Testing common letters (e.g., \"t,\" \"s,\" \"r\") for frequently recurring emoji will likely improve our progress.\n- Use unique letters for the others based on encoded frequency and typical English word patterns.\n\nFor this round, let's make the following guesses:\n\n### Guess:\n💩=e, 🐭=h, 🐰=a, 🐶=o, 🤑=t, 😂=n, 🧐=g, 🤗=u, 🤮=i, 🥵=y, 🙄=s, 🐵=p, 🤥=v\n\n### Answer:\nAnswer: 💩=e,🐭=h,🐰=a,🐶=o,🤑=t,😂=n,🧐=g,🤗=u,🤮=i,🥵=y,🙄=s,🐵=p,🤥=v"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Here's the encoded sentence, analyzed with the current hint (`🐭=s`) and including the game's rules:\n\n### Encoded Sentence:\n```\nhe ha🐭 al🐭o a🧐🧐ea😎ed 🐹🥵 ma🥵y h🐹🐦hly-accla🐹med telev🐹🐭🐹o🥵 d😎ama🐭 🐭uch a🐭 the lake🐭, 🐭tate o🤧 🧐lay a🥵d two 🦆a🤧ta awa😎d-w🐹🥵🥵🐹🥵🐦 🐭e😎🐹al🐭; clock🐹🥵🐦 o🤧🤧 a🥵d 🐭e🐰 t😎a🤧🤧🐹c.\n```\n\n### Hint & History:\n- Hint: `🐭=s`\n- History: Attempt 1 confirmed `🐭=s`.\n\n### Analysis:\nLet’s start decoding parts of the sentence:\n1. **🐭=s**, so let's update the sentence:\n```\nhe has also a🧐🧐ea😎ed 🐹🥵 ma🥵y h🐹🐦hly-accla🐹med telev🐹s🐹o🥵 d😎amas such as the lakes, state o🤧 🧐lay a🥵d two 🦆a🤧ta awa😎d-w🐹🥵🥵🐹🥵🐦 sesame; clocks🐦 o🤧🤧 a🥵d ses🐰 t😎a🤧🤧🐹c.\n```\n\nSome observations:\n- Spaces, punctuation, and proper nouns are preserved in the original sentence.\n- Words are English phrases related to media, awards, and television.\n- 🐭 decoded everywhere as `s`.\n\n---\n\n### Exploration:\nLet's attempt to decode further. Commonly seen emoji are potential candidates for high-frequency letters:\n\n- 🧐 appears often; it may correspond to \"e\" if we consider English word frequency.\n- 🐹 seems frequent; likely to also represent high-frequency letters (e.g., \"t,\" \"r,\" or \"n\").\n- 🥵 appears frequently as well; this might correspond to vowels (e.g., \"a,\" \"i,\" or \"o\"). \n\nLet’s make a **guess for Attempt 2** based on logical substitutions:\n\n- 🧐=e (based on high emoji occurrence and common English frequency).\n- 🐹=t (common in English, could be \"t\" from the phrase `telev🐹s🐹o🥵` → \"television\").\n- 🥵=a (potential ‘a’ for phrases like \"many,\" \"awards\").\n\n---\n\n### Current Guess:\n```\n🐭=s, 🧐=e, 🐹=t, 🥵=a\n```\n\n---\n\n### Updated Encoded Sentence with Guesses:\n```\nhe has also aeeea😎ed tta many htthly-acclatmed televtssoa d😎amas such as the lakes, state o🤧 ela and two 🦆a🤧ta awa😎d-wttaettta sesame; clocks🐦 o🤧🤧 and ses🐰 tra🤧🤧tc.\n```\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 🐭=s, 🧐=e, 🐹=t, 🥵=a","Let's solve the problem step by step:\n\n### Decoding with the rules\n1. We know from the hint that `🐭=s`. Thus, every instance of `🐭` in the Encoded Sentence is replaced with `s`.\n\n2. In Attempt 2, previous guesses for `🧐=e`, `🐹=t`, and `🥵=a` were incorrect. Therefore, those mappings are wrong, and we won't reuse them in this attempt.\n\n3. Our task in this attempt is to make new guesses for the replacement of the emojis other than `🐭`.\n\n---\n\n### Working on the Encoded Sentence\nLet's see how decoding progresses with the hint `🐭=s` applied to the sentence:\n\n```\nhe ha🐭 al🐭o a🧐🧐ea😎ed 🐹🥵 ma🥵y h🐹🐦hly-accla🐹med telev🐹🐭🐹o🥵 d😎ama🐭 🐭uch a🐭 the lake🐭, 🐭tate o🤧 🧐lay a🥵d two 🦆a🤧ta awa😎d-w🐹🥵🥵🐹🥵🐦 🐭e😎🐹al🐭; clock🐹🥵🐦 o🤧🤧 a🥵d 🐭e🐰 t😎a🤧🤧🐹c.\n```\n\nAfter replacing `🐭=s`, it becomes:\n```\nhe has also a🧐🧐ea😎ed 🐹🥵 ma🥵y h🐹🐦hly-accla🐹med telev🐹s🐹o🥵 d😎amas such as the lakes, state o🤧 🧐lay a🥵d two 🦆a🤧ta awa😎d-w🐹🥵🥵🐹🥵🐦 se😎🐹als; clocks🥵🐦 o🤧🤧 a🥵d se🐰 t😎a🤧🤧🐹c.\n```\n\n---\n\n### Observations\n1. The sentence seems to describe a person involved in television, dramas, or awards. The encoded sentence heavily mentions awards (\"awa😎d\") and television (\"telev🐹s🐹o🥵\").\n\n2. Based on word patterns, certain guesses can be reasoned:\n   - The emoji `😎` could be \"r\" because \"awa😎d\" fits the English word \"award.\"\n   - The emoji `🐹` is likely \"t\" since \"telev🐹s🐹o🥵\" could become \"television\" if `🐹=t`.\n\n---\n\n### New Guesses for this Attempt\nLet's combine our observations with prior knowledge:\n- `🐭=s` (already confirmed)\n- `😎=r` (new guess based on \"awa😎d\" → \"award\")\n- `🐹=t` (new guess based on \"telev🐹s🐹o🥵\" → \"television\")\n\n---\n\n### Generating the Full Answer\nThe provided hint (`🐭=s`) and new guesses (`😎=r, 🐹=t`) form our response. Following the required rules for formatting:\n\n```\nAnswer: 🐭=s, 😎=r, 🐹=t\n```","To solve the current round, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. From the hint, we know `🐭=s`.\n2. From previous guess feedback, `😎=r` is correct.\n3. We also know that `🐹` is incorrect in previous guesses (both `🐹=t`).\n\nNow, let's provide the updated answer based on the encoded sentence and feedback.\n\n### My Guess:\nI will retain the correct emojis (`🐭=s`, `😎=r`) and attempt to deduce new assignments carefully based on the encoded sentence.\n\nAnswer: 🐭=s, 😎=r","Let's analyze the game state carefully and make logical guesses based on the feedback so far:\n\n### Information Recap:\n1. 🐭 = s (confirmed as hint).\n2. 😎 = r (confirmed in attempt #4).\n3. 🧐 = e, 🐹 = t, 🥵 = a were marked as incorrect in attempt #2.\n4. 🐹 = t was also marked as incorrect in attempt #3, confirming 🐹 cannot represent \"t.\"\n\n### Strategy:\nFrom Attempt #4, we have 🐭 = s and 😎 = r. We'll now focus on deducing other mappings by analyzing the encoded sentence and adhering to the rules.\n\n### Encoded Sentence with Substitutions:\nSubstituting confirmed mappings:\n\"he ha🐭 al🐭o a🧐🧐ea😎ed 🐹🥵 ma🥵y h🐹🐦hly-accla🐹med telev🐹🐭🐹o🥵 d😎ama🐭 🐭uch a🐭 the lake🐭, 🐭tate o🤧 🧐lay a🥵d two 🦆a🤧ta awa😎d-w🐹🥵🥵🐹🥵🐦 🐭e😎🐹al🐭; clock🐹🥵🐦 o🤧🤧 a🥵d 🐭e🐰 t😎a🤧🤧🐹c.\"\n\nSubstitutions so far:\n- 🐭 = s\n- 😎 = r\n\nWords with 🐭 and 😎 substituted:\n\"he has also a🧐🧐eared 🐹🥵 ma🥵y h🐹🐦hly-accla🐹med telev🐹s🐹oa🥵 drama s🤧ch as the lakes, state o🤧 🧐lay a🥵d two 🦆a🤧ta awards-w🐹🥵🥵🐹🥵🐦 serials; clocks🐦 o🤧🤧 a🥵d s🐰 tra🤧🤧🐹c.\"\n\n### Observations:\n1. \"he has\" suggests 🐭 = s is consistent.\n2. The word \"also\" suggests one of the 🧐 = l or o fits well.\n3. The phrase \"state o🤧 🧐lay\" suggests 🤧 = f (state of play).\n4. The word \"serials\" suggests 🦆 = w (serials = awards-winning works).\n5. Past guesses marked 🐹 = false for several options like t and l.\n\n### Updated Guesses:\n- 🐭 = s (confirmed)\n- 😎 = r (confirmed)\n- 🧐 = l (guess based on \"also\")\n- 🤧 = f (guess based on \"state of\")\n- 🐹 = c (guess based on letters fitting in \"clocks\" and \"serials\")\n- 🦆 = w (guess based on \"serials\" and matching context)\n\n### Answer:\nAnswer: 🐭=s, 😎=r, 🧐=l, 🤧=f, 🐹=c, 🦆=w","Based on the encoded sentence, the provided hint 🐭=s, and the feedback from previous guesses, we can refine our current guesses.\n\n### Analysis:\n- 🐭=s: Confirmed.\n- 😎=r: Confirmed.\n- 🤧=f: Confirmed.\n- Other guesses for 🧐, 🐹, 🥵, and 🦆 were incorrect. \n- Furthermore, new guesses need to replace these previously attempted values.\n\n### Updated Guess:\nWe have learned 🐭=s, 😎=r, and 🤧=f. Using these along with patterns from the sentence structure, we hypothesize the matches for the next attempt.\n\n### Attempt 6 Guess:\n🐭=s, 😎=r, 🤧=f, 🧐=i, 🐹=o, 🦆=u, 🥵=m\n\n### Answer:\nAnswer: 🐭=s, 😎=r, 🤧=f, 🧐=i, 🐹=o, 🦆=u, 🥵=m","Based on the encoded sentence, the hint provided (\"🐭=s\"), and feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce further answers.\n\nObservations:\n1. 🐭 is confirmed to be 's'.\n2. 😎 is confirmed to be 'r'.\n3. 🤧 is confirmed to be 'f'.\n4. 🧐 has been tried as 'e', 'l', and 'i' — all incorrect.\n5. 🐹 has been tried as 't' and 'o' — both incorrect.\n6. 🦆 has been tried as 'w' and 'u' — both incorrect.\n7. 🥵 has been tried as 'a' and 'm' — both incorrect.\n\nFor this turn, the strategy is to make educated guesses for 🧐, 🐹, 🦆, and 🥵 using untested letters.\n\n### Updated guesses:\n1. Given that 🧐 isn't 'e', 'l', or 'i', I'll try 🧐 = 'h' (commonly used letters in English text).\n2. Since 🐹 hasn't been 't' or 'o', I'll try 🐹 = 'n' (another frequent English letter).\n3. 🦆 hasn't been 'w' or 'u', so I'll guess 🦆 = 'g'.\n4. 🥵 hasn't been 'a' or 'm', let's try 🥵 = 'd'.\n\nThus, submitting:\n'🐭=s, 😎=r, 🤧=f, 🧐=h, 🐹=n, 🦆=g, 🥵=d'.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 🐭=s, 😎=r, 🤧=f, 🧐=h, 🐹=n, 🦆=g, 🥵=d","Given the rules provided and the history of feedback from previous guesses, I will make my next attempt.\n\n### Observations:\n1. `🐭=s` and `😎=r` have consistently been confirmed as correct.\n2. `🤧=f` is correct.\n3. The emojis `🧐`, `🐹`, `🦆`, and `🥵` have been repeatedly marked as wrong with the previous guesses. This suggests their respective letters are still incorrect.\n\n### Strategy:\nI will focus on deducing the remaining unknown emojis and adjust my guesses for `🧐`, `🐹`, `🦆`, and `🥵`. Based on the structure of the sentence and encoded hints, I will attempt plausible replacements.\n\n### Attempt:\nGuess: 🐭=s, 😎=r, 🤧=f, 🧐=u, 🐹=l, 🦆=v, 🥵=g\n\n### Output:\nAnswer: 🐭=s, 😎=r, 🤧=f, 🧐=u, 🐹=l, 🦆=v, 🥵=g","Based on the game's history and the feedback provided, we know:\n\n1. 🐭 = s (from hint and feedback across all attempts)\n2. 😎 = r (confirmed true in attempts 3–8)\n3. 🤧 = f (confirmed true in attempts 5–8)\n4. 🧐 has consistently been marked false for u, h, i, e, and l.\n5. 🐹 has been marked false for t, c, o, n, and l.\n6. 🦆 has been marked false for w, u, g, and v.\n7. 🥵 has been marked false for a, m, d, and g.\n\nNow, it's time to analyze the patterns and deduce likely mappings for the remaining emojis. From feedback and encoded sentence structure:\n\n### Deduction:\n- 🧐 appears twice together (\"a🧐🧐ea\") — indicating a vowel repetition likely. Since the false guesses include 'e', 'i', 'u', 'h', and 'l', 🧐 could reasonably be 'o.'\n- 🐹 appears multiple times, suggesting it's a frequently occurring letter like 'n' or 'l.' Since previous attempts have ruled out 'c', 't', 'o', 'n', and 'l', 🐹 might reasonably be 'a.'\n- 🦆 appears sparingly in the sentence, making it less likely to be a common letter. Since 'w', 'u', 'g', and 'v' are incorrect, 🦆 could reasonably be 'p.'\n- 🥵 appears often and in varied contexts (\"ma🥵y,\" \"🥵ea,\" \"telev🐹🐭🐹o🥵\"), suggesting it's a vowel or consonant often paired with other letters. Based on feedback and remaining options, 🥵 could reasonably be 'o.'\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 🐭=s, 😎=r, 🤧=f, 🧐=o, 🐹=a, 🦆=p, 🥵=o","To solve this, we will rely on the feedback from previous guesses and eliminate incorrect mappings.\n\n### Observations:\n1. 🐭=s and 😎=r are absolutely correct based on feedback.\n2. 🤧=f is confirmed true based on feedback.\n3. All attempts to map 🧐, 🐹, 🦆, and 🥵 have failed, so we need to test them with new guesses.\n\nOur task is to propose new guesses for 🧐, 🐹, 🦆, and 🥵 while preserving 🐭=s, 😎=r, and 🤧=f.\n\n### New Guess:\nLet’s choose other potential letters for 🧐, 🐹, 🦆, and 🥵 based on elimination or linguistic likelihood. Common letters still unused include: e, t, n, c.\n\n### Submission:\nAnswer: 🐭=s, 😎=r, 🤧=f, 🧐=c, 🐹=e, 🦆=n, 🥵=t"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Looking at past feedback, we know what they can’t be and will choose new candidates.\n\n3. **Guessing Next Values:**\n   - Based on the encoded sentence, `🐶` appears frequently—likely a common vowel or consonant. If it’s not `i`, `o`, or `e`, let’s try `u`.\n   - For `👻`, since it’s not `s`, `c`, or `r`, let’s try `l`.\n\n### Guesses for Attempt 4:\n- 🐨=a (from the hint).\n- 🐶=u (new guess).\n- 🤔=t (from prior correct guesses).\n- 👻=l (new guess).\n\n### Answer:\nAnswer: 🐨=a,🐶=u,🤔=t,👻=l","### Step 1: Analyze the feedback and previous guesses\nFrom the history:\n- 🐨=a has been consistently correct.\n- 🤔=t has been consistently correct.\n- 🐶 guesses have been consistently incorrect. So far, the guesses were i, o, e, u. This eliminates vowels.\n- 👻 guesses have been consistently incorrect. So far, the guesses were s, c, r, l.\n\n### Step 2: Eliminate possibilities and update guesses\n- 🐶 might be one of the consonants left (such as n, m, p, etc.).\n- 👻 might be another consonant left (such as d, g, etc.).\n\n### Step 3: Update guesses\nI will retain the confirmed emojis 🐨=a and 🤔=t, and test new values: 🐶=n and 👻=d.\n\n### Step 4: Submit the answer\nAnswer: 🐨=a,🐶=n,🤔=t,👻=d","### Analysis\nBased on the given question and feedback history:\n- 🐨=a (This is confirmed via the hint and every feedback so far.)\n- 🤔=t (This is confirmed by consistent feedback that it's correct.)\n- 🐶 has been incorrect for all listed guesses (options e, i, o, u, and n).\n- 👻 has also been incorrect for all listed guesses (options s, c, r, l, and d).\n\nWith 🐶 and 👻 consistently being wrong, we should exclude all previously attempted mappings and try new ones.\n\n### Updated Guesses for 🐶 and 👻:\n1. For 🐶, we haven't tried b.\n2. For 👻, we haven't tried k.\n\n### New Guess\n🐨=a, 🤔=t (both confirmed), 🐶=b, 👻=k.\n\n### Final Output\nAnswer: 🐨=a,🐶=b,🤔=t,👻=k","**Analysis**\nBased on the history of guesses and feedback:\n- 🐨 is undoubtedly \"a\" (from the history and hint).\n- 🤔 is \"t\" (it has consistently been correct across all attempts).\n- 🐶 has been incorrect for all previously guessed values (i, o, e, u, n, b). Thus, it may be another vowel or a less common consonant.\n- 👻 has also been incorrect for all previously guessed values (s, c, r, l, d, k). It might represent a letter that hasn't been tested yet or one that occurs infrequently.\n\n**Next Steps**\nFrom the remaining vowels (a, e, i, o, u), \"🐶\" must be something else, as all vowel attempts failed. This suggests \"🐶\" could be a consonant like \"f,\" \"g,\" \"h,\" \"m,\" \"p,\" etc.\nFor \"👻,\" it’s worth exploring infrequent letters, or letters that commonly appear with combinations, e.g., \"m,\" \"n,\" etc.\n\n### **Guess for Attempt 7:**\n🐨=a, 🐶=m, 🤔=t, 👻=f\n\n**Answer:** 🐨=a,🐶=m,🤔=t,👻=f","Based on the encoded sentence, the current guesses, feedback from prior attempts, and the hint 🐨=a, we know the following:\n\n1. 🐨=a is confirmed correct.\n2. 🤔=t is confirmed correct.\n3. 👻=f is confirmed correct.\n4. 🐶 has been consistently incorrect for all guesses so far. Therefore, 🐶 must represent a letter we haven't guessed yet. The remaining possibilities for 🐶 include letters like \"g,\" \"h,\" etc.\n\nNow, let’s proceed with a new guess:\n\n### My guess for this round:\n🐨=a, 🐶=h, 🤔=t, 👻=f\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 🐨=a,🐶=h,🤔=t,👻=f","To solve this, we'll focus on the hint provided as well as incorporate feedback from previous guesses to determine the correct mapping for the emojis.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze History and Feedback\n- 🐨 is confirmed as \"a\" in all guesses.\n- 🤔 is confirmed as \"t\" in all guesses.\n- 🐶 failed multiple guesses (i, o, e, u, n, b, m, h), so it's not any of these.\n- 👻 succeeded in the last two guesses as \"f\".\n\n### Step 2: Input Updated Answer\nFrom the hints and history:\n- 🐨 = a\n- 🤔 = t\n- 👻 = f\n- 🐶 needs to be guessed since it hasn't been solved yet. Since it failed for common letters, a logical next guess for 🐶 might be \"g\" since it's untested.\n\n### Step 3: Provide the Answer\nUpdated guesses with logic applied:\n```Answer: 🐨=a,🐶=g,🤔=t,👻=f```","Let's analyze the encoded sentence, history, and feedback to determine the correct mapping.\n\n### Information Recap:\n- Encoded Sentence: `psyche 🐨ppe🐨🐶s 🤔o be 🐨 genuine c🐨se o👻 🐨n expose🥺 me🤔🐨🐮🐮ic co🐶e 👻🐶om 🐨 🐮🐨🐶ge🐶 🥺i👻👻e🐶en🤔i🐨🤔e🥺 p🐨🐶en🤔 bo🥺y.`\n- Hint: 🐨 = a\n- History:\n  - 🐨=a is consistently true.\n  - 🤔=t is consistently true.\n  - 🐶 passes through many guesses but none are correct (b, g, h, m, n, o, u, e are all rejected).\n  - 👻=f (true in attempt 7).\n\nThus far:\n- 🐨=a\n- 🤔=t\n- 👻=f\n\n### Analysis:\n- We need to deduce the mapping for 🐶 based on feedback and exclusion.\n- Remaining options for 🐶 (common letters not yet tried): w, y, z.\n\n### Hypothesis for Attempt 10:\nLet’s guess 🐶=y, as \"psyche\" and other English words might work with it, and remaining options w\/z are less common.\n\n### Final Guess:\n🐨=a, 🐶=y, 🤔=t, 👻=f\n\n---\n\nAnswer: 🐨=a,🐶=y,🤔=t,👻=f"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

We are given the encoded sentence, a hint, and rules on how to decode it. The character 🐷 represents the letter \"e\" according to the hint.\n\n### Observations:\n1. The emoji 🐷 occurs frequently in the encoded sentence, and we now know it equals \"e\".\n2. This information, combined with the structure of the encoded sentence, suggests that some patterns, such as \"🐷🦆🐶l 🐨😴 l🐷\" or \"🥶🐷🐶\" might represent common English words like \"eel,\" \"let,\" or \"eel.\" \n","Alright! Let's break this down systematically. First, we know that 🐷 = e based on the hint provided.

Based on the hint provided, we know that 🐷 corresponds to \"e\". Our solution must include both this hint and any observations we can infer while decoding the encoded sentence.\n\n### Observations:\n1. 🐷 appears multiple times in the encoded sentence and is already resolved.\n2. There are two distinct structures in the encoded sentence: standalone emojis (e.g., 🤓, 🧐) and shorter grouped sections (e.g., \"🐮🐨🤓🥶\").\n3. Words appearing frequently might contain a high-frequency letter such as \"e\".\n\nLet’s assume and guess some general letters based on the frequency of remaining emojis.\n\n### First round guesses:\nUsing existing resolved mappings (🐷=e), we try reasonable guesses by parsing patterns. \n","Let's analyze the provided encoded sentence and work through the game. We already know that 🐷 corresponds to \"e\". Using this hint, combined with frequency analysis and educated guessing based on letter positions in English words, we can attempt to decrypt more emojis this round.\n\n### Game Information\n- Encoded Sentence: 🧐🤓 1265, 🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓 🥳🐷 🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶, 6🥶🤖 🐷🦆🐶l 🐨😴 l🐷🧐c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶 🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓🐷🥳 🥶🤖🐷 😴🧐🐶🤭🥶 🐷l🐷c🥶🐷🥳 🦉🦆🐶l🧐🦆🐮🐷🤓🥶.\n- Hint: 🐷 = e\n- History:\n  1. Guess: 🐷 = e\n     Feedback: {'🐷': True}\n\n---\n\n### Observations and Hypotheses\n- 🐷 appears very frequently, confirming it as \"e\".\n- Common English word patterns such as \"the\", \"and\", \"be\", \"he\", and \"she\", as well as letters like \"a\", \"t\", \"h\", and \"s\", are likely candidates for exploration.\n- Numbers like 1265 may remain undeciphered for now (perhaps they are spelled out later).\n\n---\n\n### Initial Assignments\nUsing 🐷 = e as the base:\n1. 🧐 often appears at the beginning and is followed by 🤓. The pattern suggests \"to\" or \"is\":\n   🧐 = i, 🤓 = s\n2. 🐮🐨 often appears together near 🐷. It could be \"th\":\n   🐮 = t, 🐨 = h\n3. 🥳 frequently follows 🐷 (\"e\"). It may be \"r\" or \"d\":\n   🥳 = r\n4. 🥶 appears repeatedly at the end of words. It may be \"s\":\n   🥶 = s\n5. 🤭 appears in multiple places. It could be \"a\" (common vowel):\n   🤭 = a\n6. 🐶 appears near 🐷 (\"e\") and others. It could be \"n\":\n   🐶 = n\n7. 😴 could be \"o\" based on its placement:\n   😴 = o\n\n---\n\n### Current Assignments\nFollowing these deductions:\n- 🐷 = e (confirmed)\n- 🧐 = i\n- 🤓 = s\n- 🐮 = t\n- 🐨 = h\n- 🥳 = r\n- 🥶 = s\n- 🤭 = a\n- 🐶 = n\n- 😴 = o\n\n---\n\n### Submission Format\nLet’s prepare the answer using the required format:\n\n```\nAnswer: 🐷=e,🧐=i,🤓=s,🐮=t,🐨=h,🥳=r,🥶=s,🤭=a,🐶=n,😴=o\n```\n\nAnswer: 🐷=e,🧐=i,🤓=s,🐮=t,🐨=h,🥳=r,🥶=s,🤭=a,🐶=n,😴=o","Let's analyze the encoded sentence and provided hints.

The emoji t could possibly be \"t\" in letters like \"it,\" \"at,\" or \"the.\"\n2. \"in 1967\" suggests a historical reference, and we will use that structure as a clue.\n3. \"$750.00\" indicates we're dealing with a financial figure – words like \"dollars\" or \"cost\" could appear.\n\nNow, let's make our **first guess** based on this analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Guess for this Round:\nAnswer: 🤩=r\n\n","Here is the analysis and guess submission for the current round.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n1. **Given Information:**\n   - The encoded sentence contains various emojis with substitution rules where each emoji uniquely corresponds to a letter.\n   - The decoding for 🤩 is already provided as `r`.\n\n2. **History:**\n   - In the first attempt, the guess 🤩=r was correct.\n\n3. **Breaking down the problem:**\n   - By identifying repeating patterns and common elements in the encoded sentence, I can start forming reasonable guesses for each emoji.\n   - Words like \"the\" and \"in\" are common in English, and patterns like \"t ____ i ___\" could correspond to similar words such as \"this\" or \"that.\"\n   \n4. **Words containing 🤩:**\n   - \"🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩\" ends in \"🤩,\" indicating the word ends in `r`. It could be a variation of \"their,\" \"user,\" or similar.\n   - \"😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d\" includes multiple 🤩. This could relate to \"result,\" \"retired,\" or something akin, as it must include \"r.\"\n\n5. **Guess Plan:**\n   - Using letter patterns and frequency analysis, I'll suggest mappings for key emojis.\n\n### Guesses:\n- 🤩=r (already verified from Hint).\n- 🤑=e: As \"e\" is the most common letter in English, 🤑 frequently appears in the encoded sentence, making it a good candidate.\n- 🐻=t: \"🐻\" occurs in positions suggesting \"t,\" a frequent word-ending or common letter.\n- 😎=s: \"😎\" consistently appears in places suggesting it could be \"s.\"\n- 🦊=h: The second word starts with \"🤔🦊,\" which could correspond to \"He\" or \"Hi.\"\n- 🐸=i: Starts the sentence and reappear. Common in pronouns (\"I\") and other short words.\n- 🤔=a: Often appears near vowels.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 🤩=r, 🤑=e, 🐻=t, 😎=s, 🦊=h, 🐸=i, 🤔=a","Let's break this down systematically:\n\n### Feedback Analysis:\n1. From **Guess 2**, we know:\n   - 🤩 = r (True, confirmed from feedback)\n   - 🤑 = e (True, confirmed from feedback)\n   - 🤔 = a (True, confirmed from feedback)\n\n2. The other emojis from Guess 2—🐻, 😎, 🦊, 🐸—are incorrect guesses.\n\n### Strategy:\nThe sentence seems to reference numbers and money (“1967” and “$750.00”). It’s probable that emojis are mapping to letters in English words, so logical words related to the context of the sentence should be guessed.\n\n### Known Values:\n- 🤩 = r\n- 🤑 = e\n- 🤔 = a\n\n### New Guess:\nLet’s try making additional guesses using these hints and the context of the sentence.\n- Words like \"in\", \"the\", \"it\", \"and\", \"was\", etc., are common in sentences. Using frequency analysis and logical inference:\n  - 🐻 = n (Possibly making \"in\")\n  - 🦊 = h\n  - 🐸 = i\n  - 😎 = s\n  - 🥺 = l\n  - 🤖 = o\n  - 😴 = t\n  - 🥴 = d\n\n### New Guess:\n'🤩=r, 🤑=e, 🤔=a, 🐻=n, 🦊=h, 🐸=i, 😎=s, 🥺=l, 🤖=o, 😴=t, 🥴=d'\n\nAnswer: 🤩=r, 🤑=e, 🤔=a, 🐻=n, 🦊=h, 🐸=i, 😎=s, 🥺=l, 🤖=o, 😴=t, 🥴=d","### Analysis:\nBased on the hint and history:\n- 🤩 = r, 🤑 = e, 🤔 = a, 🥺 = l\n- 🐻, 🦊, 🐸, 😎, 🤖, 😴, 🥴 are incorrect as guessed before and need adjustments.\n\nThe given sentence is:\n\n🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈 🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩 d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺 😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d 🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d t🥴🤑 😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑 🐸🤩🐻🤖 🤩🐻t🥴 in 1967 🐸🐻🤩 🦊😴 $750.00.\n\nLet's refine our guesses based on feedback and structure.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy:\n1. 🤩 is repeated and confirmed as \"r.\"\n2. 🤑 is repeated often, suggesting vowels or common letters like \"e\" (confirmed as \"e\").\n3. 🥺 appears frequently, confirmed as \"l.\"\n4. 🤔 confirmed as \"a.\"\n5. 🐻, 🦊, 🐸, 😎, 🤖, 😴, 🥴 are incorrect in initial guesses, so we'll try new assignments.\n\n### Refined Guess Assignments:\n- 🐸 = i (common starting letter of words)\n- 🦊 = h\n- 🐻 = n\n- 😎 = s\n- 🤖 = o\n- 😴 = t\n- 🥴 = d\n\n---\n\n### Decoding Attempt:\nUsing updated guesses:\n\nEncoded Sentence:\n🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈 → ielena😈  \n🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑 → ahtonontise  \n🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩 → uhthonizer  \nd🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺 → daraal  \n😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d → taraid  \n🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d → muhruhtedd  \nt🥴🤑 → tded  \n😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑 → sediled  \n🐸🤩🐻🤖 → iron  \n🤩🐻t🥴 → rontd  \nin 1967 → unchanged  \n🐸🐻🤩 → inr  \n🦊😴 → ht  \n$750.00 → unchanged\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer Format:\nAnswer: 🤩=r, 🤑=e, 🤔=a, 🥺=l, 🐸=i, 🦊=h, 🐻=n, 😎=s, 🤖=o, 😴=t, 🥴=d","### Step 1: Analyzing the Feedback\nFrom the given feedback, we know:\n- **🤩 = r**, **🤑 = e**, **🤔 = a**, **🥺 = l** are correct.\n- **🐻, 🐸, 🦊, 😎, 🤖, 😴, 🥴** are all incorrect as per the last attempt.\n  \nThus, we can exclude the incorrect guesses and refine the unknown emojis.\n\n---\n\n### Current Deductions:\n- From previous History guesses, we now know:\n  - 🐻, 🤖, 😴, 🥴 are not \"n, o, t, d\".\n  - 😎 is not \"s\".\n  - 🦊 is not \"h\".\n  - 🐸 is not \"i\".\n\nThis significantly narrows down the possible letters.

Observations about the encoded sentence:\n   - 🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈\n     - Starts with 🐸 followed by correctly guessed characters (🤑 = e, 🥺 = l). Previous guesses suggest that 🐸 is not \"i\".\n   - Repeat patterns:\n     - 🤗🦊😴, d🤔🤩🤩🤧, 🐭🦊🤩: These sequences are structured and might inform word structure once decoding progresses.\n\n4. Strategy:\n   - Focus on testing different letters for emojis that haven’t been decoded yet.\n   - Keep valid mappings (🤩 = r, 🤑 = e, 🤔 = a, 🥺 = l) in every submission.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Formulating the next guess\n\nWe'll attempt new letter assignments for unresolved emojis:\n- 🐸 = c  \n- 🦊 = h  \n- 😎 = s  \n- 🐻 = n  \n- 🤖 = o  \n- 😴 = t  \n- 🥴 = d  \n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Submitting the guess in the required format\n\nAnswer: 🤩=r, 🤑=e, 🤔=a, 🥺=l, 🐸=c, 🦊=h, 🐻=n, 😎=s, 🤖=o, 😴=t, 🥴=d","To decipher the sentence encoded with emojis, we use the information provided with previous feedback and make educated guesses.\n\nFrom History:\n- 🤩 = r (confirmed true)\n- 🤑 = e (confirmed true)\n- 🤔 = a (confirmed true)\n- 🥺 = l (confirmed true)\n- Other emojis such as 🐸, 🦊, 🐻, 😎, 😴, 🤖, 🥴 have been confirmed as incorrect with their previously guessed mappings.\n\nNow we need to analyze the encoded sentence and try different plausible mappings for the remaining emojis:\n\n### Observations:\n1. 🐸 appears multiple times in contexts like 🐸🤑🥺 and 🐸🐻🤩.\n   - Since 🤑 = e and 🥺 = l, 🐸 might be a consonant that works with \"el\", like \"c\" or \"d\".\n   \n2. 🦊 appears in sequences such as 🦊t, 🦊😴t.\n   - It could map to a consonant starting these combinations, such as \"h\" or \"p\".\n\n3. 🐻 is used in patterns like 🤔🦊t🐻 and 🐸🤩🐻.\n   - A plausible guess might be \"n\".\n\n4. 😎 has not been easy to guess so far. It shows up in contexts like 😎🤑 and might be \"s\".\n\n5. 🤖 is paired with known letters (e.g., 🐻🤖ti). This might represent \"o\" given its context.\n\n6. 😴 appears alongside 🤩 and others frequently (e.g., 🤗😴t and 😴t). It could potentially be \"t\".\n\n7. 🥴 is used in 🥴🤑 and 😴t🥴. Perhaps it maps to \"d\".\n\n### Renewed Guess:\n\n- 🐸 = c (try again since \"c\" has been suspected; however, it got feedback as false before, let's try \"f\").\n- 🦊 = h\n- 🐻 = n\n- 😎 = s\n- 🤖 = o\n- 😴 = t\n- 🥴 = d\n\n### Format:\nAnswer: 🤩=r, 🤑=e, 🤔=a, 🥺=l, 🐸=f, 🦊=h, 🐻=n, 😎=s, 🤖=o, 😴=t, 🥴=d","Based on the history of feedback and guesses, we know the following to be true:\n\n1. 🤩 = r\n2. 🤑 = e\n3. 🤔 = a\n4. 🥺 = l\n5. 🐸 = f\n\nFor this attempt, we will omit the emojis (🦊, 🐻, 😎, 🤖, 😴, 🥴) that are consistently marked as False and avoid repeating incorrect guesses.

We can now try 🦊=p (a reasonable next guess).\n- 🐻 has been incorrect with \"t\", \"n\", and \"g\". A logical guess might be 🐻=v.\n- 😎 has been incorrect with \"s\" and \"y\". Next, we can try 😎=u.\n- 🤖 has been incorrect with \"o\" and \"i\". It could be 🤖=c.\n- 🥴 has been incorrect with \"t\" and \"d\".

A possibility is `w`, as that’s left untested.\n- 🐻: Incorrect guesses included `t`, `n`, `g`, and `v`. A candidate could be `o`, as it hasn’t been tested.\n- 😎: Incorrect guesses included `s`, `y`, and `u`. It could be `d`, as it is commonly used.\n- 🤖: Incorrect guesses included `o`, `i`, and `c`. Guessing `n`, as it is frequent in English.\n- 🥴: Incorrect guesses included `d`, `k`, and `t`. It might stand for `g`, since it hasn’t been tested here.\n\n### New Mapping:\nBased on the above reasoning, I will make the following guess:\n\n🤩 = r, 🤑 = e, 🤔 = a, 🥺 = l, 🐸 = f, 😴 = s, 🦊 = w, 🐻 = o, 😎 = d, 🤖 = n, 🥴 = g\n\n### Final Output:\nAnswer: 🤩=r,🤑=e,🤔=a,🥺=l,🐸=f,😴=s,🦊=w,🐻=o,😎=d,🤖=n,🥴=g","To derive the solution, let's analyze the feedback from the previous guesses while adhering to the rules.

Similarly, 😈ea😍e🐸 could be \"reate🐸\" or \"create.\" Hypothetically, 🐸 could be \"s.\"\n4. The structure of \"(5: 20)\" indicates that the keys represent a specific code or operation. However, this may not directly influence word guessing but instead describes a key count or position.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate Guesses\nLet's build on the hints and the observed patterns while decoding:  \n\n- 😍 = t (Given)  \n- 🐼 = h (\"the\" appears feasible, frequently enough)  \n- 🐸 = s (\"task\" or similar structure aligns with this guess)\n- 😈 = r (\"there\" and \"force\" suggest this aligns)  \n\n### Step 3: Format the Answer\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐼=h,🐸=s,😈=r","Let's decode this round using the Crypto Word Game rules. From the hint ('😍=t') and feedback from Attempt 1 (`{'😍': True, '🐼': False, '🐸': False, '😈': False}`), we know:\n\n1. 😍 is correctly assigned to 't'.\n2. 🐼, 🐸, and 😈 were incorrectly guessed as 'h', 's', and 'r', respectively. This means we need to guess new letters for these emojis.\n\n### Observations:\n- The sentence appears to have structured phrases with spaces and punctuation. Based on the context and the encoded sentence structure, some patterns may emerge.\n- To improve guesses, we consider common letters in English and clues from potential word structure. Common letters include 'e', 'a', 'o', 'i', etc.\n\n### Adjusted Guesses:\n- From the hint, we include 😍=t in our answer as it is correct.\n- Analyze other emojis (from History and encoded sentence) and refine guesses.\n\nHere’s the proposed answer for Attempt 2:\n**😍=t** remains correct.\n**🐼=a**: Could be 'a' based on position and frequency.\n**🐸=e**: Another common vowel likely to fit in the word pattern.\n**😈=o**: A potential vowel in many word structures.\n**🐷=f**: The emoji corresponding to a single letter may correspond to 'f' (based on context like \"a🐷 sno🐶\" which could form \"a few snow\").\n**🐶=w**: Fits with words like \"snow\" or \"with.\"\n**🐦=m**: Likely a consonant ('m') in the sentence patterns.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐼=a,🐸=e,😈=o,🐷=f,🐶=w,🐦=m","### Given encoded sentence: \n😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission.\n\n### Hint:\n😍 = t\n\n---\n\n### Decoding History:\n1. **Guess:** 😍=t,🐼=h,🐸=s,😈=r  \n   **Feedback:** {'😍': True, '🐼': False, '🐸': False, '😈': False}\n\n2. **Guess:** 😍=t,🐼=a,🐸=e,😈=o,🐷=f,🐶=w,🐦=m  \n   **Feedback:** {'😍': True, '🐼': False, '🐸': False, '😈': False, '🐷': False, '🐶': True, '🐦': True}  \n\n### Observations:\n1. 😍=t is confirmed to be correct from previous attempts.  \n2. 🐶=w and 🐦=m are also confirmed to be correct from Attempt 2 feedback.  \n3. 🐼 has been tested as \"h\" and \"a,\" and neither worked, meaning 🐼 is a different letter.  \n4. 🐸 has been tested as \"s\" and \"e,\" and neither worked, meaning 🐸 is a different letter.  \n5. 😈 has been tested as \"r\" and \"o,\" and neither worked, meaning 😈 is a different letter.  \n6. 🐷 was tested as \"f\" and was incorrect, meaning 🐷 is a different letter.\n\n---\n\n### New Guess:\nFor this attempt, I need to test new plausible substitutions for the undecoded emojis.\n\n- From context of common English word patterns:\n   - The encoded sentence begins with \"😍a🐼🐼,\" which might be \"ta__,\" suggesting 🐼 could be \"k\" or \"l.\"\n   - \"🐸e😈ea😍e🐸\" suggests words like \"release\" (possibly testing 🐸=l and 😈=s).\n\n---\n\n### Guess:\n😍=t,🐼=l,🐸=l,😈=s,🐷=c,🐶=w,🐦=m  \n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐼=l,🐸=l,😈=s,🐷=c,🐶=w,🐦=m","### Analysis and Deduction\n\nWith the provided encoded sentence, hint, and history, I'll analyze the feedback to make my next guess.\n\n#### Known Information:\n- **😍 = t** (Hint and consistent across all attempts)\n- **🐶 = w** (Confirmed correct in Attempts 2 & 3)\n- **🐦 = m** (Confirmed correct in Attempts 2 & 3)\n\n#### Incorrect Guesses:\n- **🐼 = h, a, l** (Repeatedly incorrect in all attempts)\n- **🐸 = s, e, l** (Repeatedly incorrect in all attempts)\n- **😈 = r, o, s** (Repeatedly incorrect in all attempts)\n- **🐷 = f, c** (Incorrect in all attempts)\n\n#### Revised Guesses:\nLet’s apply logic to narrow down the possibilities:\n1. **First phrase (\"😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶\"):**\n   - Start decoding based on known letters:\n     - 😍 = t → **\"ta🐼🐼 🐸e😈eat🐸 a🐷 snow\"**.\n     - 🐶 = w and 🐦 = m:\n       - Rewrite as **\"ta🐼🐼 🐸e😈eat🐸 a🐷 snow\"**.\n   - Possible word for \"snow\" makes sense with 🐷 = n.\n\n2. **Second phrase (\"😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶\"):**\n   - Decode:\n     - 😍 = t, 🐶 = w → **\"ta🐼🐼 force🐸 snow\"**.\n\n3. **Third phrase (\"😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission\"):**\n   - Known letters and context:\n     - 😍 = t, 🐶 = w, 🐦 = m:\n     - Rewrite: **\"to submti🦄 to 😍t mis\"...\n\n","### Step 1: Analyze History Feedback and Current Hint\nBased on history and feedback:\n- 😍 = t (Confirmed True)\n- 🐼 = Not h, Not a, Not l → Possible choices still open for 🐼.\n- 🐸 = Not s, Not e, Not l → Possible choices still open for 🐸.\n- 😈 = Not r, Not o, Not s → Possible choices still open for 😈.\n- 🐷 = Not f, Not c → Possible choices still open for 🐷.\n- 🐶 = w (Confirmed True)\n- 🐦 = m (Confirmed True)\n\n### Step 2: Current Sentence Analysis\nEncoded Sentence: 😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission.\n\nDecoded so far based on confirmed emojis:\n- 😍 = t\n- 🐶 = w\n- 🐦 = m\n\nPartial decoding:\n- \"ta🐼🐼 🐸e😈eat🐸 a🐷 snow (5: 20) ta🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 snow to submittw twith the ta🐼🐼mmission.\"\n\nGiven the structure and hint, there might be common thematic words such as \"mission,\" \"force,\" \"submit,\" etc. 🐼 could map to “o,” 🐸 could map to \"c,\" 😈 could map to \"n,\" and 🐷 could be \"b.\"\n\n### Step 3: Make Improved Guess Based on Words\nUsing possible mappings:\n- 🐼 = o\n- 🐸 = c\n- 😈 = n\n- 🐷 = b\n- Include confirmed guesses (😍=t, 🐶=w, 🐦=m)\n\n### Final Answer\n'Answer: 😍=t,🐼=o,🐸=c,😈=n,🐷=b,🐶=w,🐦=m'","Given the task parameters, let's determine the next set of guesses based on the feedback from history and the hint.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1.

The emoji 🐦=m is also **correct**, as it was positively confirmed in Guess 2 and Guess 7.\n\n### Let's revisit the rejects:\n- 🐼 has consistently been marked False with guesses such as h, a, l, o, r, n, and k. It's clear 🐼 represents a letter not tried yet.\n- 🐸 has also been marked False with guesses s, e, l, c, i, c, and t.

The remaining emojis to decode: 🐼, 🐸, 😈, 🐷.  \n2. The structure of the encoded sentence gives some clues:  \n   - 😍a🐼🐼 likely translates to \"that,\" \"them,\" \"then,\" or similar words (common short words starting with \"t\").  \n   - The phrase contains \"😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸,\" indicating a word like \"to force\" or \"the force.\"  \n   - The phrase \"🐸e😈ea😍e🐸\" could be \"release,\" \"redeem,\" \"revive,\" or similar patterns.\n\nGiven the context and common English letter frequencies:  \n- 🐼 = h seems plausible (\"that\" or \"them\").  \n- 🐸 = e (e is very common in English).  \n- 😈 = r (common in verbs like \"redeem,\" \"release\").  \n- 🐷 = s (frequent in endings and plurals).  \n\n### Step 3: My Guess for This Round\n\nBased on the analysis above, my submission is:  \n😻 = t, 🐶 = w, 🐦 = m, 🐼 = h, 🐸 = e, 😈 = r, 🐷 = s\n\n---\n\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐶=w,🐦=m,🐼=h,🐸=e,😈=r,🐷=s","### Step 1: Analyze the Results\n\nThe hint states that 😍 = \"t\", and the feedback indicates that:\n- 😍 = \"t\" is correct.\n- 🐶 = \"w\" is correct.\n- 🐦 = \"m\" is correct.\n\nAll other guesses for 🐼, 🐸, 😈, and 🐷 have been incorrect in every past attempt.

Given its shown placement within words like \"s🦆r🦆s,\" we hypothesize 🦆=s (confirmed incorrect in previous attempts—we will avoid this mapping).\n2. 😍 seems to be consistently wrong—we'll try a different letter.\n3. 🐹, 🤥, 😂, 🤔 mappings should reflect remaining valid consonants or vowels based on observed word structure.\n4.

Emojis proven to be incorrect across several attempts:\n   - 😍, 🦆, 🐹, 🤥, 😂, 🤔\n\nThis means the emojis we prefer for 🤥, 🦆, and 😍 specifically need to be reconsidered.
