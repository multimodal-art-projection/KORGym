In English, 't' and 's' are very common. Let's guess 🐔=t.\n    *   Word 5 now looks like 🦆👽🥶🐼et (_ _ _ _ e t).

'pa__en_er'. Given 🐔🐔, 'passenger' fits well. This implies 🐔=s, 🥺=n, 😴=g.\n    *   Word 2: t r a 🤑 🥺 🐔 (6 letters). Substituting known\/guessed letters: t r a 🤑 n s. 'trains' fits. This implies 🤑=i.\n    *   Word 5: 🦆 o r 🐼 e 🐔 (6 letters). Substituting: 🦆 o r 🐼 e s. '_or_es'. 'forces' fits. This implies 🦆=f, 🐼=c.\n    *   Word 6: 🤥 🥺 t 🤑 🤠 (5 letters). Substituting: 🤥 n t i 🤠.

So, c=c, 🐨=m, s=s.\n    *   Looking at `w🤖🐶` (wa🐶), with 🤖=a, it could be 'war' (🐶=r) or 'way' (🐶=y). 'war' fits the context slightly better. Let's assume 🐶=r.\n    *   Looking at `i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t` (in🦆ol🦆e🐨ent). With 👽=n, 🦆=v, 🤭=o, l=l, e=e, 🐨=m, t=t, this becomes 'involvement'. This fits perfectly: i=i, n=n, 🦆=v, 🤭=o, l=l, 🦆=v, e=e, 🐨=m, e=e, n=n, t=t.\n\n5.  **Substitute all findings:**\n    🐵. s. involvement in the war comes to an end.\n    This leaves 🐵 and s. Given the structure \"X. Y.\", they might be initials like \"M. S.\". Let's assume 🐵=M and s=s (since s=s was derived from 'comes').\n\n6.  **Final assignments:**\n    🐵=M, s=s, i=i, 👽=n, 🦆=v, 🤭=o, l=l, e=e, 🐨=m, t=t, 🦁=h, w=w, 🤖=a, 🐶=r, c=c, 🐻=d.\n\n7.  **Format the answer:**\n    List all emoji-letter pairs according to the assignments.\n\nAnswer: 🐵=M,s=s,i=i,👽=n,🦆=v,🤭=o,l=l,e=e,🐨=m,t=t,🦁=h,w=w,🤖=a,🐶=r,c=c,🐻=d","Okay, I can help with this Crypto Word game!\n\nHere's my analysis and guess for Attempt 2:\n\n1.  **Known Information:**\n    *   Encoded Sentence: 🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\n    *   Hint: 👽=n\n    *   Correctly Guessed (from Attempt 1): 👽=n, 🦆=v, 🤭=o, 🐨=m, 🦁=h, 🤖=a, 🐶=r, 🐻=d\n    *   Incorrect Guesses (from Attempt 1): 🐵≠M, s≠s, i≠i, l≠l, e≠e, t≠t, w≠w, c≠c\n\n2.  **Substituting Known Letters:**\n    Filling in the correct letters gives:\n    🐵. s. i n v o l v e m e n t i n t h e w a r c o m e s t o a n e n d .\n    This structure strongly suggests the sentence \"A\/I . A\/I . involvement in the war comes to an end.\" However, the feedback explicitly states that the guesses i=i, l=l, e=e, t=t, w=w, c=c, s=s were incorrect for those emojis.\n\n3.  **Analyzing Frequent Unknowns and Short Words:**\n    *   The most frequent unknown emojis are `e` (4 times) and `t` (3 times).\n    *   Consider the ending: `t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.` -> `t o a n e n d .`\n    *   `t🤭` (`t o`?) -> Requires `t=t`, which is false.\n    *   `🤖👽` (`a n`) -> Uses only known correct letters. Correct.\n    *   `e👽🐻` (`e n d`?) -> Requires `e=e`, which is false.\n    *   `t🦁e` (`t h e`?) -> Requires `t=t` and `e=e`, both false.\n\n4.  **Hypothesis: Swapped Letters (t=e, e=t):**\n    If `t` and `e` are swapped (`t=e`, `e=t`), this satisfies the constraints (`t≠t`, `e≠e`). Let's test this:\n    *   `t🤭` -> `e o` (\"eo\" - matches `to`)\n    *   `e👽🐻` -> `t n d` (\"tnd\" - matches `end`)\n    *   `t🦁e` -> `e h t` (\"eht\" - matches `the`)\n    This swap seems very likely.\n\n5.  **Guessing Remaining Letters:**\n    *   Single letter words `🐵` and `s`: Likely 'A' and 'I'. Let's guess `🐵=A` and `s=I`. (Constraints 🐵≠M, s≠s are satisfied).\n    *   `i👽` (`i n`?): Requires `i=i`, which is false. Let's try a common vowel `i=u`. (\"un\").\n    *   `w🤖🐶` (`w a r`?): Requires `w=w`, which is false. Let's try `w=f`. (\"far\").\n    *   `c🤭🐨es` (`c o m e s`?): Emojis `c, 🤭, 🐨, e, s`. With `e=t` and `s=I`, this becomes `c o m t I`. Requires `c=c`, which is false. Let's try `c=g`. (\"gomtI\"). This word looks strange.\n    *   `i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t` (`involvement`?): Emojis `i, 👽, 🦆, 🤭, l, 🦆, e, 🐨, e, 👽, t`. With `i=u`, `e=t`, `t=e`, this becomes `u n v o l v t m t n e`. Requires `l=l`, which is false. Let's try `l=p`. (\"unvopvtmtne\"). This also looks strange.\n\n6.  **Final Guess Formulation:** Despite the strangeness of \"unvopvtmtne\" and \"gomtI\", the hypothesis `t=e, e=t` fits the structure `the`, `to`, `end` perfectly. Let's proceed with the most consistent guesses found so far.\n\n    *   🐵=A\n    *   s=I\n    *   i=u\n    *   👽=n (Hint)\n    *   🦆=v (Correct History)\n    *   🤭=o (Correct History)\n    *   l=p (Guess, l≠l)\n    *   e=t (Guess based on swap, e≠e)\n    *   🐨=m (Correct History)\n    *   t=e (Guess based on swap, t≠t)\n    *   🦁=h (Correct History)\n    *   w=f (Guess, w≠w)\n    *   🤖=a (Correct History)\n    *   🐶=r (Correct History)\n    *   c=g (Guess, c≠c)\n    *   🐻=d (Correct History)\n\nAnswer: 🐵=A,s=I,i=u,👽=n,🦆=v,🤭=o,l=p,e=t,🐨=m,t=e,🦁=h,w=f,🤖=a,🐶=r,c=g,🐻=d","Okay, I can help with this Crypto Word game. Here's my thinking process and guess for Attempt 3:\n\n1.  **Analyze the known information:**\n    *   Encoded Sentence: 🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\n    *   Hint: 👽=n\n    *   Attempt 1 Correct: 👽=n, 🦆=v, 🤭=o, 🐨=m, 🦁=h, 🤖=a, 🐶=r, 🐻=d\n    *   Attempt 1 Incorrect: 🐵≠M, s≠s, i≠i, l≠l, e≠e, t≠t, w≠w, c≠c\n    *   Attempt 2 Correct: (Same as Attempt 1) 👽=n, 🦆=v, 🤭=o, 🐨=m, 🦁=h, 🤖=a, 🐶=r, 🐻=d\n    *   Attempt 2 Incorrect: 🐵≠A, s≠I, i≠u, l≠p, e≠t, t≠e, w≠f, c≠g\n    *   Combined Incorrect: 🐵≠M,A; s≠s,I; i≠i,u; l≠l,p; e≠e,t; t≠t,e; w≠w,f; c≠c,g\n\n2.  **Substitute known letters:**\n    🐵. s. i n v o l v e m e n t i n t h e w a r c o m e s t o a n e n d.\n\n3.  **Identify potential words based on structure and known letters:**\n    *   `i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t` -> `i n v o l v e m e n t`\n    *   `i👽` -> `i n`\n    *   `t🦁e` -> `t h e`\n    *   `w🤖🐶` -> `w a r`\n    *   `c🤭🐨es` -> `c o m e s`\n    *   `t🤭` -> `t o`\n    *   `🤖👽` -> `a n`\n    *   `e👽🐻` -> `e n d`\n\n4.  **Analyze the contradictions:**\n    The most likely words (involvement, in, the, war, comes, to, end) require the following mappings for the unknown emojis: i=i, l=l, e=e, t=t, w=w, c=c, s=s.\n    However, the feedback from Attempt 1 explicitly states that all these mappings are incorrect (i≠i, l≠l, e≠e, t≠t, w≠w, c≠c, s≠s). This creates a significant contradiction if we assume case-insensitivity.\n\n5.  **Hypothesize Case Sensitivity:**\n    The only way the most obvious sentence \"U. S. involvement in the war comes to an end.\" fits is if the feedback was case-sensitive. For example, feedback `s≠s` means emoji `s` is not lowercase `s`, but it could be uppercase `S`. Let's test this hypothesis.\n    *   Assume: i=I, l=L, e=E, t=T, w=W, c=C, s=S.\n    *   Check constraints:\n        *   i=I (Constraint i≠i,u - OK if case-sensitive)\n        *   l=L (Constraint l≠l,p - OK if case-sensitive)\n        *   e=E (Constraint e≠e,t - OK if case-sensitive)\n        *   t=T (Constraint t≠t,e - OK if case-sensitive)\n        *   w=W (Constraint w≠w,f - OK if case-sensitive)\n        *   c=C (Constraint c≠c,g - OK if case-sensitive)\n        *   s=S (Constraint s≠s,I - OK if case-sensitive)\n\n6.  **Determine the remaining emojis (🐵):**\n    The sentence structure is `🐵. s. ...` which strongly suggests initials. \"U. S.\" is a common initialism.\n    *   Guess 🐵=U.\n    *   Check constraints: 🐵≠M,A - U is OK.\n\n7.  **Formulate the guess:**\n    Based on the case-sensitive hypothesis and the \"U. S. involvement...\" sentence:\n    *   🐵=U\n    *   s=S\n    *   i=I\n    *   l=L\n    *   e=E\n    *   t=T\n    *   w=W\n    *   c=C\n    *   Include knowns: 👽=n, 🦆=v, 🤭=o, 🐨=m, 🦁=h, 🤖=a, 🐶=r, 🐻=d\n\n8.  **Construct the final answer string:**\n    Combine all mappings into the required format, including previously known correct ones.\n\nAnswer: 🐵=U,s=S,i=I,👽=n,🦆=v,🤭=o,l=L,e=E,🐨=m,t=T,🦁=h,w=W,🤖=a,🐶=r,c=C,🐻=d"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Tass is a Russian news agency, which could fit a narrative context.\n    *   **🐷:** The structure is `a 🐷 snow`. We know 🐷 ≠ n. With 🐼 = s, the sentence is: `t a s s   d e f e a t e d   a 🐷   s n o w   (5: 20)   t a s s   f o r c e d   s n o w   t o   s u b m i t   w i t h   t h e   t a s s   m i s s i o n.` What could `a 🐷 snow` be? It's a bit cryptic. Let's consider remaining common letters. Maybe 'g'? `a g snow`. It could be an abbreviation or an initial. Let's try g for 🐷.\n\n5.  **Current Guess Set:**\n    *   😍 = t (Correct)\n    *   🐸 = d (Correct)\n    *   😈 = f (Correct)\n    *   🐶 = w (Correct)\n    *   🐦 = m (Correct)\n    *   🐼 = s (Guess)\n    *   🐷 = g (Guess)\n\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐼=s,🐸=d,😈=f,🐷=g,🐶=w,🐦=m","Okay, let's break this down.\n\n**Encoded Sentence:** 😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission.\n\n**Known Information:**\n*   Hint: 😍=t\n*   Attempt 1 Correct: 😍=t, 🐸=d, 😈=f, 🐶=w, 🐦=m\n*   Attempt 1 Incorrect: 🐼=l, 🐷=n\n*   Attempt 2 Correct: 😍=t, 🐸=d, 😈=f, 🐶=w, 🐦=m\n*   Attempt 2 Incorrect: 🐼=s, 🐷=g\n\n**Current State:**\n*   Known letters: 😍=t, 🐸=d, 😈=f, 🐶=w, 🐦=m\n*   Constraints: 🐼≠l, 🐼≠s, 🐷≠n, 🐷≠g\n\n**Substituting known letters into the sentence:**\nt a 🐼 🐼   d e f e a t e d   a 🐷   s n o w   (5: 20)   t a 🐼 🐼   f o r c e d   s n o w   t o   s u b m i t   w i t h   t h e   t a 🐼 🐼 m i s s i o n .\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  Most words seem fully decoded based on the plaintext letters and the known emojis: `defeated`, `snow`, `forced`, `to`, `submit`, `with`, `the`.\n2.  We need to determine the letters for 🐼 and 🐷.\n3.  The structure `t a 🐼 🐼` appears three times.\n4.  The word `a 🐷` appears once.\n5.  The final word seems to be `t a 🐼 🐼 m i s s i o n`.\n\n**Focusing on `a 🐷`:**\n*   It's a two-letter word starting with 'a'.\n*   Possible words: ab, ac, ad, ae, af, ag, ah, ai, aj, ak, al, am, an, ao, ap, aq, ar, as, at, au, av, aw, ax, ay, az.\n*   We know 🐷 cannot be n or g.\n*   We also know emojis represent unique letters, so 🐷 cannot be t(😍), d(🐸), f(😈), w(🐶), m(🐦).\n*   This eliminates 'ad', 'af', 'ag', 'am', 'an', 'at', 'aw'.\n*   Plausible remaining common words: 'ah', 'ar', 'as', 'ay'.\n*   We know 🐼≠s from attempt 2. While 🐷 could still be 's', let's consider other options first. 'ay' (🐷=y) and 'ar' (🐷=r) seem like good candidates.\n\n**Focusing on `t a 🐼 🐼` and `t a 🐼 🐼 m i s s i o n`:**\n*   🐼 appears twice consecutively.\n*   🐼 cannot be l or s.\n*   🐼 cannot be t, d, f, w, m.\n*   Consider common letters for repeated consonants: r, p, c, k, b.\n*   Consider vowels: e, a, o.\n\n**Let's test combinations:**\n\n*   **If 🐷=y:**\n    *   Need 🐼 ≠ l, s, t, d, f, w, m, y.\n    *   Try 🐼=r: `t a r r` defeated `a y` snow ... `t a r r m i s s i o n`. 'tarr' is uncommon, 'tarrmission' isn't a standard word.\n    *   Try 🐼=p: `t a p p` defeated `a y` snow ... `t a p p m i s s i o n`. 'tapp' is uncommon, 'tappmission' isn't a standard word.\n    *   Try 🐼=c: `t a c c` defeated `a y` snow ... `t a c c m i s s i o n`. 'tacc' is uncommon, 'tacc mission' isn't standard.\n\n*   **If 🐷=r:**\n    *   Need 🐼 ≠ l, s, t, d, f, w, m, r.\n    *   Try 🐼=p: `t a p p` defeated `a r` snow ... `t a p p m i s s i o n`. Seems unlikely.\n    *   Try 🐼=c: `t a c c` defeated `a r` snow ... `t a c c m i s s i o n`. Seems unlikely.\n    *   Try 🐼=k: `t a k k` defeated `a r` snow ... `t a k k m i s s i o n`. Seems unlikely.\n\nGiven the previous failures with common letters (l, s, n, g), let's try less common but plausible options. 🐼=r and 🐷=y seem like a reasonable guess pair to try, fulfilling the constraints and using letters not yet ruled out. 'ay' is a valid word. Although 'tarr' and 'tarrmission' are odd, cryptograms can sometimes contain unusual words or names.\n\n**Guess for Attempt 3:**\n*   🐼 = r\n*   🐷 = y\n\nAnswer includes all known correct emojis plus the new guesses.\n😍=t, 🐸=d, 😈=f, 🐶=w, 🐦=m, 🐼=r, 🐷=y\n\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐸=d,😈=f,🐶=w,🐦=m,🐼=r,🐷=y","Okay, I will analyze the provided information and make my next guess.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Encoded Sentence:** 😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission.\n2.  **Hint:** 😍=t\n3.  **Known Correct Mappings:**\n    *   😍 = t\n    *   🐸 = d\n    *   😈 = f\n    *   🐶 = w\n    *   🐦 = m\n4.  **Substituting known letters:**\n    t a 🐼 🐼   d e f e a t e d   a 🐷   s n o w   ( 5 :   2 0 )   t a 🐼 🐼   f o r c e d   s n o w   t o   s u b m i t   w i t h   t h e   t a 🐼 🐼 m i s s i o n .\n5.  **Analysis of Unknowns:**\n    *   `😍a🐼🐼` (t a 🐼 🐼): This four-letter word\/name appears three times. The last occurrence is part of `t a 🐼 🐼 m i s s i o n`. Given that 🐼=l, 🐼=s, 🐼=r were incorrect, and 🐼 cannot be t (as 😍=t), let's consider other letters that can form a double after 'a'. Common patterns like 'tall', 'tass', 'tarr' are out. Names like 'Tagg', 'Tapp', 'Tabb' are possibilities. Let's try 🐼 = p ('Tapp').\n    *   `a🐷`: This two-letter word starts with 'a'. 🐷 cannot be n, g, or y based on previous incorrect guesses. If 🐼=p, then 🐷 also cannot be t, d, f, w, m, p. The phrase is \"defeated a 🐷 snow\". If 'Tapp' is a name\/entity, what could 'a 🐷 snow' be? Maybe 'AI snow' (Artificial Intelligence snow)? This would mean 🐷 = i. 'i' has not been excluded yet.\n6.  **Test Hypothesis:** Let's try 🐼=p and 🐷=i.\n    *   Used letters: t, d, f, w, m, p, i. All unique.\n    *   Sentence becomes: \"t a p p   d e f e a t e d   a i   s n o w   ( 5 :   2 0 )   t a p p   f o r c e d   s n o w   t o   s u b m i t   w i t h   t h e   t a p p   m i s s i o n .\"\n    *   This reading seems plausible within a potential sci-fi or coded context (\"Tapp\" entity, \"AI snow\" technology\/code).\n\n**Guess Construction:**\nInclude all known correct mappings and the new guesses for 🐼 and 🐷.\nKnown: 😍=t, 🐸=d, 😈=f, 🐶=w, 🐦=m\nNew Guesses: 🐼=p, 🐷=i\n\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐸=d,😈=f,🐶=w,🐦=m,🐼=p,🐷=i","Okay, let's analyze the information we have.\n\n**Encoded Sentence:** 😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission.\n**Hint:** 😍 = t\n**Attempt:** 5 of 10\n\n**Known Letters (From Hint and History):**\n😍 = t\n🐸 = d (True in Attempts 1, 2, 3, 4)\n😈 = f (True in Attempts 1, 2, 3, 4)\n🐶 = w (True in Attempts 1, 2, 3, 4)\n🐦 = m (True in Attempts 1, 2, 3, 4)\n\n**Incorrect Guesses:**\nFor 🐼: l, s, r, p (Attempts 1, 2, 3, 4)\nFor 🐷: n, g, y, i (Attempts 1, 2, 3, 4)\n\n**Partially Decoded Sentence:**\nt a 🐼 🐼 \/ d e f e a t e d \/ a 🐷 \/ s n o w \/ (5: 20) \/ t a 🐼 🐼 \/ f o r c e d \/ s n o w \/ t o \/ s u b m i t \/ w i t h \/ t h e \/ t a 🐼 🐼 m i s s i o n.\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe fully decoded words confirm the letters: d, e, f, a, t, s, n, o, w, r, c, u, b, m, i, h.\nThe sentence structure seems to be: `[Word1] defeated [Word3] snow (reference) [Word1] forced snow to submit with the [Word1 + mission].`\n\nWe need to find letters for 🐼 and 🐷.\n\n**Analyzing Unknowns:**\n1.  `ta🐼🐼`: A four-letter word starting with 'ta' and ending with a double letter 🐼🐼. This word appears twice. Since 🐼 cannot be l, s, r, p, common words like `tall`, `tass`, `tarp`, `tarr` are out. Also, 🐼 cannot be t, d, f, w, m (already assigned). Maybe 🐼 is c, k, b, g, n, h, z? `tacc`, `takk`, `tabb`, `tagg`, `tann`, `tahh`, `tazz`? None are standard English words.\n2.  `a🐷`: A two-letter word starting with 'a'. 🐷 cannot be n, g, y, i. Could 🐷 be l, s, h, b, c, k, o, u, p, r, ...? Possible words: `al`, `as`, `ah`, `ab`, `ac`, `ak`, `ao`, `au`, `ap`, `ar`. Given the context \"defeated a🐷 snow\", maybe \"Al Snow\" (a name)? If 🐷=l, then `al`. Or `as` snow? If 🐷=s. Or `ah` snow? If 🐷=h.\n3.  `ta🐼🐼mission`: This word combines `ta🐼🐼` and `mission`. If 🐼=c, `tacc mission`. If 🐼=k, `takk mission`. If 🐼=b, `tabb mission`. If 🐼=g, `tagg mission`. If 🐼=n, `tann mission`. None of these look correct.\n\n**Strategy for Guess 5:**\nLet's try less common consonants that haven't been ruled out.\nTry 🐼 = c. It hasn't failed (l, s, r, p failed).\nTry 🐷 = l. It hasn't failed (n, g, y, i failed). This makes `a🐷` = `al`. The sentence becomes: `tacc defeated al snow (5: 20) tacc forced snow to submit with the tacc mission.`\nWhile \"tacc\" and \"tacc mission\" are strange, this combination hasn't been tried and follows the constraints.\n\n**Guess:**\n😍=t\n🐸=d\n😈=f\n🐶=w\n🐦=m\n🐼=c\n🐷=l\n\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐸=d,😈=f,🐶=w,🐦=m,🐼=c,🐷=l","Okay, I will analyze the provided information and make my guess.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Known Information:**\n    *   Encoded Sentence: 😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission.\n    *   Hint: 😍=t\n    *   Known Correct Mappings (from History):\n        *   😍 = t\n        *   🐸 = d\n        *   😈 = f\n        *   🐶 = w\n        *   🐦 = m\n        *   🐷 = l\n    *   Known Incorrect Guesses for 🐼: l, s, r, p, c\n\n2.  **Substitute Known Letters into the Sentence:**\n    Replacing the known emojis with their corresponding letters gives:\n    `t a 🐼 🐼   d e f e a t e d   a l   s n o w   (5: 20)   t a 🐼 🐼   f o r c e d   s n o w   t o   s u b m i t   w i t h   t h e   t a 🐼 🐼 m i s s i o n .`\n\n3.  **Identify Unknown Emojis:**\n    The only remaining unknown emoji is 🐼.\n\n4.  **Analyze Words with Unknown Emoji 🐼:**\n    *   `ta🐼🐼`: This word appears twice. It starts with 't', followed by 'a', and ends with two identical unknown letters (🐼).\n    *   `ta🐼🐼mission`: This word starts with the `ta🐼🐼` structure and ends with `mission`. The full structure is `t a 🐼 🐼 m i s s i o n`.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Possibilities for 🐼:**\n    *   We know 🐼 is not l, s, r, p, c (from failed guesses).\n    *   We know 🐼 must be different from the letters assigned to other emojis: t, d, f, w, m, l.\n    *   Combining exclusions: 🐼 cannot be c, d, f, l, m, p, r, s, t, w.\n    *   The structure `ta🐼🐼` requires a letter that can appear doubled after 'ta'.\n    *   The structure `ta🐼🐼mission` must form a valid word.\n    *   Let's consider remaining letters. What about 'n'?\n        *   If 🐼 = n, then `ta🐼🐼` becomes `tann`.\n        *   If 🐼 = n, then `ta🐼🐼mission` becomes `tannmission`.\n    *   Checking if 'n' has been excluded: 'n' was guessed for 🐷 in attempt 1 and was incorrect for 🐷, but it has not been guessed for 🐼. The letters used in the plaintext part of the sentence (like 'n' in 'snow') do not necessarily exclude 'n' for an emoji, as seen with other letters (t, d, f, l, w, m) appearing both as plaintext and emoji values.\n    *   The word `tann` is uncommon but exists. `tannmission` is not a standard English word, which is puzzling. However, given the constraints and previous failed attempts (l, s, r, p, c), 'n' seems the most likely candidate fitting the `ta🐼🐼` structure that hasn't been ruled out for 🐼.\n\n6.  **Formulate the Guess:**\n    Include all previously confirmed correct mappings and add the new guess for the remaining emoji.\n    😍=t, 🐸=d, 😈=f, 🐶=w, 🐦=m, 🐷=l, 🐼=n\n\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐸=d,😈=f,🐶=w,🐦=m,🐷=l,🐼=n","Okay, let's break this down.\n\n1.  **Analyze the confirmed information:**\n    *   Hint: 😍=t\n    *   From History (Attempt 6 Feedback): 😍=t, 🐸=d, 😈=f, 🐶=w, 🐦=m, 🐷=l are all correct.\n    *   From History (Attempts 1-6 Feedback), we know 🐼 cannot be: l, s, r, p, c, n.\n\n2.  **Substitute known values into the encoded sentence:**\n    *   Encoded: 😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission.\n    *   Substituting: t a 🐼🐼 \/ d e f e a t e d \/ a l \/ s n o w \/ (5: 20) \/ t a 🐼🐼 \/ f o r c e d \/ s n o w \/ t o \/ s u b m i t \/ w i t h \/ t h e \/ t a 🐼🐼 m i s s i o n .\n    *   This reveals that the unassigned letters (a, e, o, s, n, u, b, i, h, r, c) are themselves, as they form recognizable English words: `defeated`, `al`, `snow`, `forced`, `to`, `submit`, `with`, `the`, `mission`.\n\n3.  **Identify the remaining unknown emoji:**\n    *   The only unknown emoji is 🐼.\n\n4.  **Determine the letter for 🐼:**\n    *   We have the structure `t a 🐼🐼` appearing multiple times.
