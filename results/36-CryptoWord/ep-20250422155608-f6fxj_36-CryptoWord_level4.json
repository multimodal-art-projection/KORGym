Guess: 🤭=t,😇=n,🐹=p,🐭=c,🤓=k,🤥=u\n   Feedback: {'🤭': True, '😇': True, '🐹': True, '🐭': True, '🤓': True, '🤥': True}\n","response":["Okay, let's try to figure out this crypto word game. The encoded sentence is given, and we know that 🤭 equals 't' from the hint. Let's start by substituting all the 🤭 emojis with 't' to see what the sentence looks like.\n\nOriginal encoded sentence with 🤭 replaced: \"the germa😇 bat tleshi🐹 bismar🐭🤓 is one of the most famo🤥s warshi🐹s of the se🐭o😇d world war.\"\n\nLet's break it down. The first part is \"the germa😇 bat tleshi🐹\" — maybe \"germa\" is \"german\"? So \"germa😇\" could be \"german\" if 😇 is 'n'. Let's check that. If 😇 is 'n', then \"germa😇\" becomes \"german\". Then \"bat tleshi🐹\" — \"bat tleshi\" — maybe \"battleship\"? \"bat tleshi\" would be \"battleshi\" if 🐹 is 'p', so \"battleship\". Let's check: \"bat tleshi🐹\" → \"battleshi\" + 🐹 = \"battleship\" → 🐹 is 'p'. That makes sense.\n\nNext part: \"bismar🐭🤓\" — \"bismar\" plus 🐭 and 🤓. \"Bismarck\" is a famous German battleship. So \"bismar\" + 🐭 + 🤓 = \"Bismarck\". If \"bismar\" is the start, then maybe 🐭 is 'c' and 🤓 is 'k'? So \"bismar\" + 'c' + 'k' → \"Bismarck\". Let's tentatively say 🐭=c, 🤓=k.\n\nThen \"is o😇e of the most famo🤥s warshi🐹s\" — \"o😇e\" with 😇 being 'n' would be \"one\", which fits. So \"o😇e\" → \"one\" → 😇=n, which we thought earlier. Then \"famo🤥s\" — \"famous\" is the word, so \"famo\" + 🤥 = \"famous\" → 🤥=u (since \"famo\" + 'u' + 's' → \"famous\"). So 🤥=u.\n\nNext: \"warshi🐹s\" — we had 🐹=p earlier, so \"warshi\" + 'p' + 's' → \"warships\". That works.\n\nThen \"of the se🐭o😇d world war\" — \"se🐭o😇d\" → \"second\". \"se\" + 🐭 + \"o\" + 😇 + \"d\". If 😇=n, then \"o😇d\" is \"ond\". So \"se\" + 🐭 + \"ond\" → \"second\". So \"se\" + 'c' (if 🐭=c) + \"ond\" → \"second\". That fits! Because \"se\" + 'c' is \"sec\", then \"ond\" → \"second\". So 🐭=c. That confirms our earlier guess for 🐭=c.\n\nLet's recap the substitutions we have so far:\n\n🤭=t (given)\n😇=n (from \"germa😇\" → \"german\" and \"o😇e\" → \"one\")\n🐹=p (from \"tleshi🐹\" → \"tleship\" → \"battleship\")\n🐭=c (from \"bismar🐭🤓\" → \"bismarck\" and \"se🐭o😇d\" → \"second\")\n🤓=k (from \"bismar🐭🤓\" → \"bismarck\" since \"bismar\" + 'c' + 'k' is \"bismarck\")\n🤥=u (from \"famo🤥s\" → \"famous\")\n\nLet's check the entire sentence with these substitutions:\n\nOriginal encoded sentence:\n🤭he germa😇 ba🤭🤭leshi🐹 bismar🐭🤓 is o😇e of 🤭he mos🤭 famo🤥s warshi🐹s of 🤭he se🐭o😇d world war.\n\nSubstituting:\nt he germa n bat tleshi p bismar c k is o n e of t he mos t famo u s warshi p s of t he se c o n d world war.\n\nNow let's fix the spaces and check the actual words:\n\n\"the german battleship bismarck is one of the most famous warships of the second world war.\"\n\nYes! That makes perfect sense. All the substitutions fit. Let's list all the emojis we have:\n\n🤭=t (given)\n😇=n\n🐹=p\n🐭=c\n🤓=k\n🤥=u\n\nAre there any other emojis in the sentence? Let's check again. The emojis used are 🤭, 😇, 🐹, 🐭, 🤓, 🤥. That's all. So these are the ones we need to include in the answer.\n\n\nLet's analyze the encoded sentence by substituting the known emoji 🤭=t and deducing others:\n\n1. **Substitute 🤭=t**: The sentence becomes \"the germa😇 bat tleshi🐹 bismar🐭🤓 is o😇e of the most famo🤥s warshi🐹s of the se🐭o😇d world war.\"  \n2. **😇 deduction**: \"germa😇\" likely is \"german\" (common term), so 😇=n. This is confirmed by \"o😇e\" → \"one\" (with 😇=n, it becomes \"one\").  \n3. **🐹 deduction**: \"tleshi🐹\" in \"bat tleshi🐹\" is part of \"battleship,\" so \"tleshi🐹\" → \"tleship\" → 🐹=p.  \n4. **🐭 deduction**: \"se🐭o😇d\" is \"second\" (since 😇=n, \"se🐭ond\" → \"second\"), so 🐭=c.  \n5. **🤓 deduction**: \"bismar🐭🤓\" refers to the battleship \"Bismarck\" (with 🐭=c, \"bismarck\" → \"Bismarck\"), so 🤓=k.  \n6. **🤥 deduction**: \"famo🤥s\" is \"famous,\" so 🤥=u.  \n\nAll substitutions fit the sentence: \"the german battleship bismarck is one of the most famous warships of the second world war.\"  \n\nAnswer: 🤭=t,😇=n,🐹=p,🐭=c,🤓=k,🤥=u"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The encoded sentence has a lot of emojis, and we know that 😍=r. First, I need to look for patterns and the most frequent emojis, but since this is the first attempt, let's start with the hint.\n\nFirst, let's list out the encoded sentence with the known emoji replaced. 😍=r, so wherever there's a 😍, it's 'r'. Let's rewrite parts of the sentence:\n\nOriginal: 🐨🐶ey 🐶a😇 🐶owe🐵e😍 bee💩 😍e😂💩fo😍ce😇 by a 😇e🐨ac🐶me💩🐨 of 32 g😍e💩a😇😂e😍🙄 f😍om o💩e of 🐨🐶e 🙄w😂🙄🙄 me😍ce💩a😍y 😍eg😂me💩🐨🙄 🙄ummo💩e😇 🐨o 🤠a😍😂🙄 by 🐨🐶e 🦊😂💩g 🙄🐶o😍🐨ly befo😍e 14 👻uly.\n\nAfter replacing 😍 with r:\n\n🐨🐶ey 🐶a😇 🐶owe🐵er bee💩 re😂💩forrce😇 by a 😇e🐨ac🐶me💩🐨 of 32 gr💩a😇😂er🙄 from o💩e of 🐨🐶e 🙄w😂🙄🙄 me(r)ce💩ary reg😂me💩🐨🙄 🙄ummo💩e😇 🐨o 🤠ar😂🙄 by 🐨🐶e 🦊😂💩g 🙄🐶or🐨ly beforr e 14 👻uly.\n\nLooking at \"beforr e 14 👻uly\" – \"beforr\" might be \"before\" since \"before\" is a common word, and \"r\" is already in there. \"beforr\" would be \"before\" if the last 'r' is part of it. So \"beforr e\" could be \"before the\" or \"before 14 July\". Oh, 👻uly is probably \"July\", so 👻=J. So 👻uly = July, so 👻=J. That's a good start. So 👻=J.\n\nNext, \"f😍om\" becomes \"from\" since 😍=r, so \"from\" is correct. That checks out. So \"f😍om\" is \"from\", which is correct.\n\nLooking at \"bee💩\" – \"bee\" is part of it. Maybe \"bee\" followed by a letter. Common words with \"bee\" could be \"bees\", \"beef\", \"beek\", etc. Let's see. If 💩 is a letter, let's note that.\n\n\"re😂💩forrce😇\" – \"re\" + [😂💩] + \"forrce\" + 😇. \"forrce\" might be \"force\" if there's a typo, but \"forrce\" with two r's? Wait, \"force\" is f-o-r-c-e. Oh, \"forrce\" could be \"force\" if maybe there's a duplicate r, but maybe \"re[something]force\". \"Reinforce\" is a common word: re-in-force. So \"re\" + \"in\" + \"force\". So \"re😂💩forrce😇\" could be \"reinforce\". So 😂💩 would be \"in\". So 😂 is 'i' and 💩 is 'n'? Let's check that. If 😂=i and 💩=n, then \"re😂💩forrce😇\" becomes \"reinforce\" plus the last 😇. \"Reinforce\" ends with 'e', so the 😇 would be a letter here. Let's note that possibility.\n\n\"of 32 g😍e💩a😇😂e😍🙄\" – \"g😍e💩a😇😂e😍🙄\" with 😍=r becomes \"gre💩a😇😂er🙄\". If 💩=n, then \"gren...\". \"grenadier\" is a word (a type of soldier). Let's see: 32 grenadiers? Let's check. \"g😍e💩a😇😂e😍🙄\" = gr + 💩 (n) + a + 😇 + 😂 (i) + er + 🙄. So \"gr\" + \"n\" + \"a\" + [😇] + \"i\" + \"er\" + [🙄]. \"Grenadier\" is g-r-e-n-a-d-i-e-r. Wait, \"grenadier\" is spelled g-r-e-n-a-d-i-e-r. Let's see: \"gre\" (gr + e) but here it's \"gr\" (from g😍e, so g + r + e?), maybe I need to parse it again. The original is \"g😍e💩a😇😂e😍🙄\". Let's split the emojis: g is a letter, then 😍=r, then e (letter), then 💩, then a (letter), then 😇, then 😂, then e (letter), then 😍=r, then 🙄. So the sequence is: g + r + e + 💩 + a + 😇 + 😂 + e + r + 🙄. So \"gre\" + 💩 + \"a\" + 😇 + 😂 + \"er\" + 🙄. If 💩=n, then \"gren\" + \"a\" + 😇 + 😂 + \"er\" + 🙄. \"Grenadier\" is \"grenadier\", which is g-r-e-n-a-d-i-e-r. So \"grenadier\" would be \"gre\" + \"n\" (💩=n) + \"a\" + \"d\" (😇=d) + \"i\" (😂=i) + \"er\" (e + r) + \"s\" (🙄=s)? Then \"g😍e💩a😇😂e😍🙄\" would be \"grenadier\" if 😇=d, 😂=i, 💩=n, 🙄=s. Let's check: \"g(r)e(n)a(d)(i)e(r)(s)\" → grenadier. That fits! 32 grenadiers. That makes sense. So 32 grenadiers. So that's a possible fit.\n\nSo far, possible mappings: 😍=r, 😂=i, 💩=n, 😇=d, 🙄=s. Let's check other parts with these.\n\n\"me😍ce💩a😍y\" → me(r)ce(n)a(r)y. \"mercenary\"! Yes! \"Mercenary\" is m-e-r-c-e-n-a-r-y. So \"me😍ce💩a😍y\" = m-e-r (😍=r) -c-e-n (💩=n) -a-r (😍=r) -y. So \"mercenary\"! Perfect. So that confirms 😍=r, 💩=n. So \"me😍ce💩a😍y\" is \"mercenary\".\n\n\"😍eg😂me💩🐨🙄\" → r-eg-😂-me-n-🐨-🙄. \"regiment\" maybe? \"Regiment\" is r-e-g-i-m-e-n-t. Let's see: \"r\" (😍=r) + \"eg\" + 😂 (i) + \"me\" + \"n\" (💩=n) + 🐨 + 🙄 (s). \"regiment\" would be r-e-g-i-m-e-n-t. So if \"regiment\" is the word, then \"😍eg😂me💩🐨🙄\" would be r e g i m e n t s? Wait, the original is \"😍eg😂me💩🐨🙄\" → r eg 😂 me 💩 🐨 🙄. So r + eg + 😂 + me + n + 🐨 + 🙄. \"regiment\" is r-e-g-i-m-e-n-t. So \"regiment\" would fit if 😂=i, and then \"me\" is 'me' (m and e), \"n\" (💩=n), then 🐨=t, and 🙄=s? So \"regiment s\"? Maybe \"regiments\". Let's check. \"regiments\" is r-e-g-i-m-e-n-t-s. So \"r eg i me n t s\" → \"regiments\". That works. So \"😍eg😂me💩🐨🙄\" = regiments. So 🐨=t, 🙄=s. That's a big clue.\n\n\"🐨🐶e\" → t-🐶-e. If 🐨=t, then \"t🐶e\". Could be \"the\" if 🐶=h. \"the\" is t-h-e. So \"t🐶e\" = the → 🐶=h. Let's check. If 🐶=h, then \"🐨🐶e\" = t-h-e → \"the\". That's a common word. Let's check other parts.\n\n\"🐨🐶ey\" → t-h-e-y → \"they\". That makes sense. \"they\" is a common start. So \"🐨🐶ey\" = they. So 🐨=t, 🐶=h. That fits.\n\n\"🐶a😇\" → h-a-😇. If 😇=d (from earlier), then \"had\". \"had\" is h-a-d. So \"🐶a😇\" = had. That works. So \"h a d\" → \"had\".\n\n\"🐶owe🐵e😍\" → h-o-w-e-🐵-e-r. \"howe\" + 🐵 + \"er\". \"Hower\" is a word? Or maybe \"however\". \"However\" is h-o-w-e-v-e-r. So \"howe\" + v + \"er\" → \"however\". So \"h o w e v e r\" → \"however\". So 🐵=v. Let's check. \"🐶owe🐵e😍\" = h o w e v e r → \"however\". Perfect. So 🐵=v.\n\n\"bee💩\" → bee + n → \"been\". \"been\" is b-e-e-n. So \"bee💩\" = been. That works. So 💩=n, which we already thought.\n\n\"by a 😇e🐨ac🐶me💩🐨\" → by a d-e-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t. \"detachment\". Let's see. \"😇e🐨ac🐶me💩🐨\" → d (😇=d) + e (e) + t (🐨=t) + a (a) + c (c) + h (🐶=h) + m (m) + e (e) + n (💩=n) + t (🐨=t). \"detachment\" is d-e-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t. Yes! So \"by a detachment of 32 grenadiers...\" That makes sense. So \"😇e🐨ac🐶me💩🐨\" = detachment. So that's correct.\n\n\"🙄w😂🙄🙄\" → s-w-i-s-s. \"Swiss\". \"s w i s s\" → \"Swiss\". So \"🙄w😂🙄🙄\" = Swiss. So 🙄=s, 😂=i. That's correct.\n\n\"🙄ummo💩e😇\" → s-u-m-m-o-n-e-d. \"summoned\". \"summoned\" is s-u-m-m-o-n-e-d. So \"🙄ummo💩e😇\" = s u m m o n e d → summoned. So 🙄=s, 💩=n, 😇=d. Perfect.\n\n\"🐨o 🤠a😍😂🙄\" → t-o [🤠]a-r-i-s. \"to [something]aris\". Maybe \"to Paris\"? \"Paris\" is P-a-r-i-s. So if 🤠=P, then \"🐨o 🤠a😍😂🙄\" = t-o P-a-r-i-s → \"to Paris\". That fits. So 🤠=P.\n\n\"by 🐨🐶e 🦊😂💩g\" → by t-h-e [🦊]i-n-g. \"the [something]ing\". Maybe \"the attacking\"? \"attacking\" is a-t-t-a-c-k-i-n-g. Not sure. Alternatively, \"the marching\"? But let's see. \"🦊😂💩g\" → 🦊-i-n-g. \"ing\" is the suffix. So maybe \"commanding\"? Or \"leading\". Alternatively, \"the regimenting\" but that's less likely. Alternatively, \"the charging\". Let's hold that thought for now.\n\n\"🙄🐶o😍🐨ly\" → s-h-o-r-t-l-y. \"shortly\". \"shortly\" is s-h-o-r-t-l-y. Let's check. \"🙄🐶o😍🐨ly\" = s (🙄=s) + h (🐶=h) + o (o) + r (😍=r) + t (🐨=t) + l (l) + y (y). \"shortly\"! That's exactly it. So \"shortly before 14 July\". That makes sense. So \"🙄🐶o😍🐨ly\" = shortly. Perfect.\n\nPutting it all together, let's list the emojis and their letters:\n\n😍=r (given)\n👻=J (from 👻uly=July)\n🐨=t (from they, the, etc.)\n🐶=h (from they, the, had)\n😇=d (from had, detachment, summoned)\n💩=n (from been, mercenary, grenadier)\n😂=i (from reinforce, grenadier, Swiss)\n🙄=s (from grenadiers, Swiss, shortly)\n🐵=v (from however)\n🤠=P (from Paris)\n🦊=? Let's check \"🦊😂💩g\" = 🦊-i-n-g. The phrase is \"by the 🦊ing\". If the sentence is \"by the attacking\" then 🦊=a. \"attacking\" is a-t-t-a-c-k-i-n-g. But \"🦊ing\" would be \"aing\" which isn't a word. Alternatively, \"marching\" (m-i-n-g? No, m-a-r-c-h-i-n-g). Alternatively, \"leading\" (l-i-n-g? No, l-e-a-d-i-n-g). Maybe \"commanding\" (c-o-m-m-a-n-d-i-n-g). Alternatively, \"the regimenting\" but that's not right. Let's see the full sentence up to that point: \n\nEncoded Sentence after substitutions (with current guesses):\n\nthey had however been reinforce[d] by a detachment of 32 grenadiers from one of the Swiss mercenary regiments summoned to Paris by the [🦊]ing shortly before 14 July.\n\nAh, \"shortly before 14 July\" – 14 July is Bastille Day, so maybe \"attacking\" the Bastille. But \"by the attacking\" makes sense. Let's see \"🦊😂💩g\" = 🦊i n g. If 🦊=a, then \"aing\" which isn't right. Alternatively, \"marching\" would be m a r c h i n g. But we don't have 'm' yet. Wait, \"detachment of 32 grenadiers from one of the Swiss mercenary regiments summoned to Paris by the [something]ing shortly before 14 July.\" Maybe \"commanding\" officers? Or \"leading\". Alternatively, \"the advancing\". \"Advancing\" is a-d-v-a-n-c-i-n-g. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps \"the storming\" (s-t-o-r-m-i-n-g). But \"🙄=s\", so \"s\" is already taken. Alternatively, \"the attacking\" (a-t-t-a-c-k-i-n-g). But \"attacking\" has 'a', 't', 't', 'a', 'c', 'k', 'i', 'n', 'g'. We have t=🐨, i=😂, n=💩, so \"attacking\" would be a t t a c k i n g. The emoji sequence is 🦊 i n g. So \"attacking\" would need 🦊 to be 'a' for the first 'a'? But then the rest is 'ttacking', but the emoji is just 🦊. Maybe it's a different word. Alternatively, \"the maining\" but that's not right. Alternatively, \"the moving\". \"Moving\" is m-o-v-i-n-g. We have v=🐵, i=😂, n=💩, so \"moving\" would be m o v i n g. So \"🦊😂💩g\" = m o v i n g? But the emoji is 🦊 i n g. So maybe \"moving\" → \"m\" is 🦊. So 🦊=m. Let's check. If 🦊=m, then \"🦊😂💩g\" = m i n g. \"Ming\" is a Chinese dynasty, but \"by the Ming\" doesn't fit. Alternatively, \"marching\" → m a r c h i n g. So \"marching\" would be m a r c h i n g. So \"m a r c h i n g\" → the emojis would be 🦊 (m) a (a) r (😍) c (c) h (🐶) i (😂) n (💩) g (g). But the original is \"🦊😂💩g\", which is just 🦊 i n g. So maybe that's not it. Let's think of another part.\n\nWhat about \"👻uly\" = July, so 👻=J. That's correct.\n\nAnother part: \"a 😇e🐨ac🐶me💩🐨\" → a d e t a c h m e n t → \"a detachment\". Correct.\n\n\"g😍e💩a😇😂e😍🙄\" → g r e n a d i e r s → \"grenadiers\". Correct.\n\n\"me😍ce💩a😍y\" → m e r c e n a r y → \"mercenary\". Correct.\n\n\"😍eg😂me💩🐨🙄\" → r e g i m e n t s → \"regiments\". Correct.\n\n\"🙄ummo💩e😇\" → s u m m o n e d → \"summoned\". Correct.\n\n\"🐨o 🤠a😍😂🙄\" → t o P a r i s → \"to Paris\". Correct.\n\n\"🙄🐶o😍🐨ly\" → s h o r t l y → \"shortly\". Correct.\n\n\"beforr e 14 👻uly\" → before 14 July. Correct.\n\nSo all these fit with the current mappings. The only remaining emoji is 🦊. Let's see the part \"by 🐨🐶e 🦊😂💩g\" → by the [🦊]ing. The sentence is about Swiss mercenary regiments summoned to Paris by the [something]ing shortly before 14 July. Maybe \"the attacking\" but \"attacking\" starts with 'a'. Alternatively, \"the leading\" (l-i-n-g → \"ling\"? No). Alternatively, \"the marching\" (m-a-r-c-h-i-n-g → but the emojis here are 🦊 i n g, which is just three emojis. So \"marching\" would be longer. Maybe \"the king\"? No, \"king\" is k-i-n-g. If 🦊=k, then \"king\" → k-i-n-g. So \"by the king\" → \"by the king\". That could fit. Let's check. \"by the king\" → \"by the king\". So \"🦊😂💩g\" = k i n g → \"king\". So 🦊=k. Then \"by the king\" makes sense. Swiss mercenaries summoned to Paris by the king shortly before 14 July. That's plausible historically.

That makes a coherent sentence. Let's go through each part:\n\n- 🐨🐶ey → t h e y → they\n- 🐶a😇 → h a d → had\n- 🐶owe🐵e😍 → h o w e v e r → however\n- bee💩 → b e e n → been\n- 😍e😂💩fo😍ce😇 → r e i n f o r c e d → reinforced (the 😇=d at the end)\n- by a 😇e🐨ac🐶me💩🐨 → by a d e t a c h m e n t → by a detachment\n- of 32 g😍e💩a😇😂e😍🙄 → of 32 g r e n a d i e r s → of 32 grenadiers\n- f😍om o💩e of → f r o m o n e of → from one of\n- 🐨🐶e → t h e → the\n- 🙄w😂🙄🙄 → s w i s s → Swiss\n- me😍ce💩a😍y → m e r c e n a r y → mercenary\n- 😍eg😂me💩🐨🙄 → r e g i m e n t s → regiments\n- 🙄ummo💩e😇 → s u m m o n e d → summoned\n- 🐨o → t o → to\n- 🤠a😍😂🙄 → P a r i s → Paris\n- by 🐨🐶e → by t h e → by the\n- 🦊😂💩g → k i n g → king\n- 🙄🐶o😍🐨ly → s h o r t l y → shortly\n- befo😍e → b e f o r e → before\n- 14 👻uly → 14 J u l y → 14 July.\n\nEverything fits perfectly!

The encoded sentence is given, and we know that 😇=e. Let's start by substituting 😇 with e everywhere.\n\nFirst, let's write out the encoded sentence with 😇 replaced by e:\n\nsu🥴se🤔uesentl🐷, 🤮n 🐼e🥴🥶ua🥶🐷 1941, 600 🥺ews we🥶es sent t🙄 🥴uc🤩ean🐸 and maut🤩ausean c🙄ncen🥶at🤮🙄n cam👽s.\n\nNow, let's look for common words and patterns. Let's break down parts of the sentence.\n\nStarting with \"suesentl🐷\". Wait, \"suesentl\" might be a part of a word. Let's see: \"suesentl\" — maybe \"suesentl\" is \"suesentl\" but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe \"su🥴se🤔uesentl🐷\" — let's split it: \"su🥴s e 🤔u e nt l🐷\". So \"su🥴s e 🤔u e nt l🐷\". Maybe \"sustent...\"? Like \"sustent\" part? \"sustent\" could be \"sustent\" (sustain, sustenance). Let's see: \"su\" + 🥴 + \"s e\" — \"su\" + [🥴] + \"se\". If \"su\" + 🥴 + \"se\" is \"sust se\" (sust se), maybe \"sust\" as in \"sustained\"? Then \"se\" would be \"se\" (as in \"sustained\"), but let's check the next part: \"🤔u e nt l🐷\". If \"🤔u e nt\" is \"you e nt\" — \"you ent\"? No. Alternatively, \"🤔u e nt\" could be \"your ent\" — but \"ent\" is part of \"sent\". Wait, the original has \"u😇ntl\" — which is \"uentl\" (since 😇=e), so \"u e nt l🐷\" — \"uentl\" — maybe \"uentl\" is \"quentl\" (as in \"frequently\")? No, but \"suesentl🐷\" — maybe \"suesentl\" is \"suesentl\" → \"suesentl\" could be \"suesentl\" → \"suesentl\" is \"suesentl\" but that's not helpful. Let's move to another part.\n\nNext, \"🤮n 🐼e🥴🥶ua🥶🐷 1941\" — \"🤮n\" is probably \"In\" (since it's a common start), so 🤮=i. Let's check: if 🤮=i, then \"i n\" → \"In\". That makes sense. So \"In 🐼e🥴🥶ua🥶🐷 1941\". So \"In [🐼]e[🥴][🥶]ua[🥶][🐷] 1941\". 1941 is a year, so maybe the phrase is \"In December 1941\" (since December is a month). Let's see: December → D e c e m b e r. Let's check: \"🐼e🥴🥶ua🥶🐷\" — if it's December, let's break it down: D e c e m b e r. Let's map letters:\n\nD e c e m b e r → D e (c) e (m) (b) e (r)\n\nThe structure of \"🐼e🥴🥶ua🥶🐷\" is: [🐼] e [🥴] [🥶] u a [🥶] [🐷]\n\nSo D e c e m b e r → D (🐼) e (c) (e) m (b) e (r). Wait, the structure is [🐼] e [🥴] [🥶] u a [🥶] [🐷]. Let's count the letters: \"🐼e🥴🥶ua🥶🐷\" has 8 characters (positions: 1:🐼, 2:e, 3:🥴, 4:🥶, 5:u, 6:a, 7:🥶, 8:🐷). December is 8 letters: D (1), e (2), c (3), e (4), m (5), b (6), e (7), r (8). Oh! That matches exactly:\n\nDecember: positions 1-8: D, e, c, e, m, b, e, r.\n\nSo let's map:\n\n1: 🐼 → D (so 🐼=d)\n2: e (already known 😇=e)\n3: 🥴 → c (so 🥴=c)\n4: 🥶 → e (but 😇 is already e. Wait, December has e in position 4 (c e m b e r). So position 4 is e, which would be 😇, but here it's 🥶. So that's a conflict. Hmm. Maybe it's a different month. Let's think: 1941 is a year, and events like Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Let's think of other months. Let's check the structure again: [🐼]e[🥴][🥶]ua[🥶][🐷]. The 5th character is u, 6th is a. So \"ua\" in positions 5-6. So the month's 5th and 6th letters are u and a. Let's list months:\n\nJanuary: J a n u a r y → positions 5:u, 6:a → yes! January is J a n u a r y. Let's check:\n\nJanuary (8 letters? No, January is 7 letters: J(1), a(2), n(3), u(4), a(5), r(6), y(7). Wait, no, \"January\" is J-A-N-U-A-R-Y (7 letters). Let's count:\n\n\"🐼e🥴🥶ua🥶🐷\" is 8 characters. Let's see: 8-letter months? September (9 letters), October (7), November (8), December (8). November: N o v e m b e r. November is N(1), o(2), v(3), e(4), m(5), b(6), e(7), r(8). 5th letter m, 6th b. No. December is D(1), e(2), c(3), e(4), m(5), b(6), e(7), r(8). 5th m, 6th b. Not u and a. What about \"the war\"? No, it's a month.\n\nWait, maybe \"🐼e🥴🥶ua🥶🐷\" is \"Europea...\" No. Let's look at another part: \"600 🥺ews we🥶es sent t🙄 🥴uc🤩ean🐸 and maut🤩ausean c🙄ncen🥶at🤮🙄n cam👽s.\"\n\nWe know \"sent\" is there (from \"s😇nt\" → \"sent\"). \"600 🥺ews we🥶es sent...\" → \"600 [🥺]ews [we][🥶]es sent...\" Maybe \"600 Jews were sent...\"? Let's check: \"Jews\" → J e w s. So 🥺=j. Then \"600 Jews we[🥶]es sent...\" → \"600 Jews were sent...\" So \"we[🥶]es\" → \"were\". \"we\" + [🥶] + \"es\" → \"were\" → \"we\" + r + \"e\" (since were is w-e-r-e). So \"we\" (w e) + [🥶] (r) + \"es\" (e s). So \"we[🥶]es\" → \"w e r e s\" → \"weres\"? No, \"were\" is w e r e. So \"we🥶es\" → \"we r e s\" → \"weres\" but that's not correct. Alternatively, \"we🥶es\" could be \"we r e s\" → \"were\" + \"s\"? Maybe \"were\" is the correct past tense. Let's see: \"600 Jews were sent...\" → \"600 🥺ews we🥶es sent...\" So if 🥺=j, then \"Jews\" fits. Then \"we🥶es\" → \"were\" (since \"we\" + 🥶 + \"es\" → \"we r e s\" → \"weres\" but maybe \"we🥶e\" → \"were\". Let's check the original: \"w😇🥶😇 s😇nt\" → \"we🥶es sent\". Because the original is \"w😇🥶😇 s😇nt\" → \"w e [🥶] e s e n t\". Oh! Wait, \"w😇🥶😇\" → \"w e [🥶] e\". So \"we[🥶]e\" → \"were\" (w e r e). So [🥶]=r. So \"w e r e\" → \"were\". That works! So 🥶=r.\n\nSo if 🥶=r, then \"w😇🥶😇\" → \"w e r e\" → \"were\". Great! So that's a key. Let's note 🥶=r.\n\nNow, let's go back to \"su🥴s😇🤔u😇ntl🐷\" → \"su🥴s e 🤔u e ntl🐷\". Let's substitute 🥶=r (if that's correct). Wait, let's confirm 🥶=r. Let's check \"we🥶es\" → \"we r e s\"? No, the original is \"w😇🥶😇 s😇nt\" → \"w e 🥶 e s e n t\". So \"w e 🥶 e s e n t\" → \"we [🥶] esent\". If 🥶=r, then \"were sent\" → \"we r e sent\" → \"were sent\". Yes! That makes sense. So \"w e r e s e n t\" → \"were sent\". Perfect. So 🥶=r.\n\nSo now, 😇=e, 🥶=r.\n\nNext, \"maut🤩ausean\" → \"maut🤩ausean\". Let's split that. \"maut\" could be \"maut\" → \"mass\" but \"maut\" is not. Alternatively, \"maut\" → \"m a u t\" → \"m a u t\" → \"m a s s\" if 🤩=s? Let's see \"maut🤩ausean\" → \"m a u t [🤩] a u s e a n\". Maybe \"massacre\"? Let's check \"massacre\" → m a s s a c r e. No. \"m a u t [🤩] a u s e a n\" → \"m a u t [s] a u s e a n\" → \"mautsa usean\"? Not helpful. Let's check another part: \"🥴uc🤩ean🐸\" → \"🥴uc🤩ean🐸\". Since 🥴 is unknown, but let's see \"sent t🙄 🥴uc🤩ean🐸\" → \"sent to [🥴]uc🤩ean🐸\". \"sent to [something]\". If \"t🙄\" is \"to\", then 🙄=o. Because \"t🙄\" → \"t o\" → \"to\". So let's assume 🙄=o. Then \"t🙄\" → \"to\". That makes sense. So 🙄=o.\n\nSo \"sent to [🥴]uc🤩ean🐸\". Let's substitute 🙄=o. Now, \"c🙄nc😇nt🥶at🤮🙄n\" → \"c o n c e n t r a t i o n\" (since 😇=e, 🥶=r, 🤮=i, 🙄=o). Let's check that: \"c🙄nc😇nt🥶at🤮🙄n\" → \"c o n c e n t r a t i o n\". Yes! That's \"concentration\". So:\n\nc (c) o (🙄=o) n (n) c (c) e (😇=e) n (n) t (t) r (🥶=r) a (a) t (t) i (🤮=i) o (🙄=o) n (n). So that's \"concentration\". Perfect! So this confirms that 🤮=i, 🙄=o. Because \"at🤮🙄n\" → \"at i o n\" → \"ation\" (as in \"concentration\"). So \"at🤮🙄n\" → \"ation\" → 🤮=i, 🙄=o. That's correct. So now we have:\n\n😇=e, 🥶=r, 🙄=o, 🤮=i.\n\nLet's update the sentence with these substitutions:\n\nEncoded Sentence with substitutions:\n\nsu🥴s e 🤔u e ntl🐷, i n 🐼 e 🥴 r ua r 🐷 1941, 600 🥺 ews we r e s e nt t o 🥴 uc 🤩 e an 🐸 an d maut 🤩 ausean c o nc e ntr at i o n cam 👽 s.\n\nNow, let's parse parts:\n\n\"i n 🐼 e 🥴 r ua r 🐷 1941\" → \"In [🐼]e[🥴]ruar[🐷] 1941\". Let's think of \"In December 1941\" again. December is D e c e m b e r. Let's check the structure: \"🐼 e 🥴 r ua r 🐷\". December is 8 letters: D(1), e(2), c(3), e(4), m(5), b(6), e(7), r(8). But our current structure is [🐼] (1), e (2), 🥴 (3), r (4), u (5), a (6), r (7), 🐷 (8). So 8 letters: [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] = [🐼] e 🥴 r u a r 🐷. Let's see \"December\" would need 1=D, 2=e, 3=c, 4=e, 5=m, 6=b, 7=e, 8=r. But our 4th character is r (from 🥶=r), so 4=r. So that's not matching. Maybe \"In the war...\" No. Let's look at \"ua\" in position 5-6: u a. Maybe \"In Europear...\" No. Alternatively, \"In Germany...\" Germany is G e r m a n y. No, structure doesn't fit.\n\nNext, \"600 🥺ews we r e s e nt t o 🥴 uc 🤩 e an 🐸\" → \"600 [🥺]ews were sent to [🥴]uc[🤩]ean[🐸]\". If \"600 Jews were sent to...\" then 🥺=j. Let's assume 🥺=j. So \"Jews\" → j e w s. So \"600 Jews were sent to...\" That's plausible. So 🥺=j.\n\nThen, \"🥴uc🤩ean🐸\" → \"[🥴]uc[🤩]ean[🐸]\". Let's think of \"Auschwitz\" — a concentration camp. Auschwitz is A u s c h w i t z. Let's check: \"🥴uc🤩ean🐸\" → [🥴] u c [🤩] e a n [🐸]. Auschwitz is A u s c h w i t z. Not matching. Another camp: Treblinka? T r e b l i n k a. No. Maybe \"camps\" at the end: \"cam👽s\" → \"camps\". So \"cam👽s\" → \"c a m [👽] s\" → \"camps\" → 👽=p. So 👽=p. Then \"cam👽s\" → \"camps\". That makes sense. So 👽=p.\n\nSo \"cam👽s\" → \"camps\" → 👽=p.\n\nNow, \"maut🤩ausean\" → \"maut[🤩]ausean\". Let's see \"maut[🤩]ausean\" → \"m a u t [🤩] a u s e a n\". If this is \"m a s s a c r e a n\" (massacre an?), but \"massacre\" is m a s s a c r e. Let's see: \"maut[🤩]ausean\" → m a u t [s] a u s e a n → \"mautsa usean\"? Not helpful. Let's check \"an🐸 maut🤩aus😇n\" → \"an [🐸] maut[🤩]ausean\". If \"and\" → \"an🐸\", then 🐸=d. Because \"an🐸\" → \"and\" → 🐸=d. So \"an🐸\" → \"and\" → 🐸=d. That's a good guess. Let's check: \"an🐸\" → \"and\" → 🐸=d. Then \"and maut[🤩]ausean\".\n\nNow, \"s😇nt t🙄 🥴uc🤩ean🐸\" → \"sent to [🥴]uc[🤩]ean d\". So \"sent to [🥴]uc[🤩]eand\". Maybe \"sent to Auschwitz and...\" Auschwitz is A u s c h w i t z. Let's check: \"🥴uc🤩ean d\" → A u s c h w e n d? No. Alternatively, \"sent to Dachau and...\" Dachau is D a c h a u. No. \"sent to Buchenwald and...\" Buchenwald: B u c h e n w a l d. Let's see: \"🥴uc🤩ean d\" → B u c h e n w a l d? No. Alternatively, \"sent to concentration camps\".\n\nLet's check \"c🙄nc😇nt🥶at🤮🙄n cam👽s\" → \"concentration camps\" (since we have c o n c e n t r a t i o n c a m p s). Which matches with 👽=p. So that's correct.\n\nNow, let's look at the first part: \"su🥴s e 🤔u e ntl🐷\". Let's substitute knowns: 😇=e, 🥶=r, 🙄=o, 🤮=i, 🐸=d, 👽=p, 🥺=j (maybe). So \"su🥴s e 🤔u e ntl🐷\" → \"su[🥴]se [🤔]uentl[🐷]\". Let's think of \"sustained\" → s u s t a i n e d. No. \"sues...\" → \"sues\" (legal term). \"su[🥴]se\" → \"sucse\" (sucse is not a word). \"susse\" (s u s s e) → \"süsse\" (German for sweet), but not likely. \"suses\" (plural of sus, but not common). Alternatively, \"su[🥴]se\" → \"susse\" (s u s s e) → maybe \"susse\" as a name. Alternatively, \"su[🥴]s e\" → \"sucs e\" → \"sucks e\" → \"sucks he\"? No.\n\nLet's look at \"ntl🐷\" → \"ntl[🐷]\". If \"ntl[🐷]\" is \"ntly\" (adverb ending), then 🐷=y. So \"ntl🐷\" → \"ntly\". Let's check: \"su🥴s e 🤔u e ntly\" → \"su[🥴]se [🤔]uently\". \"subsequently\" → s u b s e q u e n t l y. Oh! That's a possibility. Let's break it down:\n\n\"subsequently\" → s u b s e q u e n t l y.\n\nLet's map to the encoded part: \"su🥴s e 🤔u e nt l🐷\".\n\ns u [🥴] s e [🤔] u e n t l [🐷]\n\nComparing to \"subsequently\":\n\ns u b s e q u e n t l y.\n\nYes! That matches exactly:\n\ns (s) u (u) [🥴] (b) s (s) e (e) [🤔] (q) u (u) e (e) n (n) t (t) l (l) [🐷] (y).\n\nWow! That's a perfect fit. So:\n\n🥴=b (since [🥴] is the 3rd character in \"subs\" → \"subs\" → s u b s)\n🤔=q (since [🤔] is in \"seq\" → \"seq\" → s e q)\n🐷=y (since [🐷] is the last character, \"ly\" → l y)\n\nLet's confirm:\n\nOriginal: \"su🥴s😇🤔u😇ntl🐷\" → s u [🥴] s e [🤔] u e n t l [🐷]\n\nWith substitutions: s u b s e q u e n t l y → \"subsequently\". Perfect! That makes sense.\n\nSo now we have:\n\n🥴=b, 🤔=q, 🐷=y.\n\nLet's check other parts with these substitutions.\n\nFirst part: \"su🥴s😇🤔u😇ntl🐷\" → \"subsequently\". Correct.\n\nNext part: \"🤮n 🐼😇🥴🥶ua🥶🐷 1941\" → \"i n [🐼] e b r u a r y 1941\". Oh! \"in [🐼]ebruary 1941\" → \"in February 1941\". February is F e b r u a r y. So:\n\n[🐼] is F (since February starts with F). So 🐼=f.\n\nLet's check: \"🐼😇🥴🥶ua🥶🐷\" → [🐼] e b r u a r y. Which is F e b r u a r y. Perfect! So 🐼=f.\n\nSo \"🤮n 🐼😇🥴🥶ua🥶🐷 1941\" → \"in February 1941\". That works.\n\nNow, let's check \"600 🥺😇ws w😇🥶😇 s😇nt t🙄 🥴uc🤩😇nwal🐸 an🐸 maut🤩aus😇n c🙄nc😇nt🥶at🤮🙄n cam👽s.\"\n\nSubstituting knowns:\n\n600 [🥺]ews were sent to b uc [🤩] e nwal d and maut [🤩] ausean concentration camps.\n\n\"600 [🥺]ews were sent to Buchenwald and...\" Buchenwald is a concentration camp. Let's check \"🥴uc🤩😇nwal🐸\" → b uc [🤩] e nwal d. Buchenwald: B u c h e n w a l d. Let's map:\n\nB u c h e n w a l d → b u c h e n w a l d.\n\nThe encoded part: b uc [🤩] e nwal d → b u c [🤩] e n w a l d. So [🤩] must be h (since Buchenwald has 'h' after 'c'). So 🤩=h.\n\nLet's check: \"b uc h e nwal d\" → \"Buchenwald\". Perfect! So 🤩=h.\n\nNow, \"maut🤩aus😇n\" → \"maut h ausean\". Let's see \"mauthausen\" — Mauthausen is a concentration camp. Mauthausen → M a u t h a u s e n. Perfect! So \"maut h ausean\" → \"Mauthausen\". So \"maut🤩aus😇n\" → \"Mauthausen\". That fits. So 🥺 must be 'j' as before? Let's check \"600 🥺ews\" → \"600 Jews\". Jews → J e w s. So 🥺=j. Then \"600 Jews were sent to Buchenwald and Mauthausen concentration camps.\" That makes sense.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nEncoded Sentence decoded:\n\nsubsequently, in February 1941, 600 Jews were sent to Buchenwald and Mauthausen concentration camps.\n\nLet's verify each substitution:\n\n😇=e (given)\n🥴=b (from \"subs\" → \"subs\" in \"subsequently\")\n🤔=q (from \"seq\" → \"seq\" in \"subsequently\")\n🐷=y (from \"ly\" → \"ly\" in \"subsequently\")\n🤮=i (from \"in\" → \"in\")\n🐼=f (from \"February\" → \"February\")\n🥶=r (from \"February\" → \"br\" in \"February\" and \"were\" → \"were\")\n🙄=o (from \"to\" → \"to\" and \"concentration\" → \"concentration\")\n🥺=j (from \"Jews\" → \"Jews\")\n🐸=d (from \"and\" → \"and\")\n👽=p (from \"camps\" → \"camps\")\n🤩=h (from \"Buchenwald\" → \"Buchenwald\" and \"Mauthausen\" → \"Mauthausen\")\n\nLet's check all emojis in the encoded sentence to ensure we have them all:\n\nEmojis present: 🥴, 😇, 🤔, 🐷, 🤮, 🐼, 🥶, 🥺, 🙄, 🤩, 🐸, 👽.\n\nWe have substitutions for all of them:\n\n🥴=b, 😇=e, 🤔=q, 🐷=y, 🤮=i, 🐼=f, 🥶=r, 🥺=j, 🙄=o, 🤩=h, 🐸=d, 👽=p.\n\nLet's confirm each part:\n\n- su🥴s😇🤔u😇ntl🐷 → subseq u ently → subsequently ✔️\n- 🤮n → in ✔️\n- 🐼😇🥴🥶ua🥶🐷 → February ✔️\n- 1941 ✔️\n- 600 🥺😇ws → 600 Jews ✔️\n- w😇🥶😇 → were ✔️\n- s😇nt → sent ✔️\n- t🙄 → to ✔️\n- 🥴uc🤩😇nwal🐸 → Buchenwald ✔️\n- an🐸 → and ✔️\n- maut🤩aus😇n → Mauthausen ✔️\n- c🙄nc😇nt🥶at🤮🙄n → concentration ✔️\n- cam👽s → camps ✔️\n\nEverything checks out. So the answer should include all these mappings.\n\nTo solve the Crypto Word Game, we start by substituting the known emoji 😇=e into the encoded sentence. We then analyze patterns, common words, and context to deduce other emojis. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **😇=e** (given hint).  \n2. **🤮=i**: \"🤮n\" likely starts a sentence, so \"In\" → 🤮=i.  \n3. **🙄=o**: \"t🙄\" follows \"sent\" and is likely \"to\" → 🙄=o.  \n4. **🥶=r**: \"w😇🥶😇\" → \"we🥶e\" → \"were\" (past tense) → 🥶=r.  \n5. **👽=p**: \"cam👽s\" → \"camps\" (plural of \"camp\") → 👽=p.  \n6. **🐸=d**: \"an🐸\" → \"and\" (connecting words) → 🐸=d.  \n7. **🐷=y**: \"ntl🐷\" → \"ntly\" (adverb ending) → 🐷=y.  \n8. **🥴=b**: \"su🥴s😇🤔u😇ntl🐷\" → \"subseq u ently\" (subsequently) → \"subs\" → 🥴=b.  \n9. **🤔=q**: \"su🥴s😇🤔u😇ntl🐷\" → \"subseq u ently\" → \"seq\" → 🤔=q.  \n10. **🐼=f**: \"🤮n 🐼😇🥴🥶ua🥶🐷 1941\" → \"in February 1941\" → \"February\" → 🐼=f.  \n11. **🥺=j**: \"600 🥺😇ws\" → \"600 Jews\" (historical context) → 🥺=j.  \n12. **🤩=h**: \"🥴uc🤩😇nwal🐸\" → \"Buchenwald\" (concentration camp) and \"maut🤩aus😇n\" → \"Mauthausen\" (another camp) → 🤩=h.  \n\nAll substitutions align with the encoded sentence and context, forming a coherent decoded message: \"subsequently, in February 1941, 600 Jews were sent to Buchenwald and Mauthausen concentration camps.\"\n\nAnswer: 🥴=b,😇=e,🤔=q,🐷=y,🤮=i,🐼=f,🥶=r,🥺=j,🙄=o,🤩=h,🐸=d,👽=p"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The encoded sentence is given, and we know that 🤩=o. First, I need to look at the sentence and replace all 🤩 with o to see if that helps. Let's write down the encoded sentence with 🤩 replaced:\n\nOriginal: 🤫🤩🤫🤩a wa🤗 an 🐷🐔😴🤩rtant 🤫🤩🐔🐔🤩🐯🐷t😂 🐷n 😴r🤥-🤫🤩l🐦🐔🙄🐷an 🐔🤥🤗🤩a🐔🤥r🐷🤫a.\n\nAfter replacing 🤩 with o: 🤫o🤫oa wa🤗 an 🐷🐔😴ortant 🤫o🐔🐔o🐯🐷t😂 🐷n 😴r🤥-🤫ol🐦🐔🙄🐷an 🐔🤥🤗oa🐔🤥r🐷🤫a.\n\nLet's break it down into parts. Let's look for common words. The first part is \"🤫o🤫oa wa🤗 an...\". Maybe \"wa🤗\" is \"was\" or \"war\" or \"way\". Let's see. The next part after \"an\" is \"🐷🐔😴ortant\". \"ortant\" looks like \"important\" if the first letters are \"im\". So \"im\" would be \"🐷🐔\", so maybe 🐷=i and 🐔=m? Let's check: if 🐷=i and 🐔=m, then \"🐷🐔😴ortant\" becomes \"im😴ortant\" which would be \"important\" if 😴=p. So \"im portant\" becomes \"important\". That makes sense. So 😴=p.\n\nSo far: 🐷=i, 🐔=m, 😴=p, 🤩=o.\n\nNext part: \"🤫o🐔🐔o🐯🐷t😂\". Let's substitute knowns: 🤫o mm o 🐯i t😂. So \"🤫o mm o 🐯i t😂\". Maybe \"important\" was part of \"important...\". Let's see. The previous part after \"an\" is \"important\", so maybe the next part is \"in the...\"? Wait, \"🐷n\" is \"i n\" which would be \"in\". So \"🐷n\" = \"in\" makes sense (since 🐷=i, so \"i n\" = \"in\"). So \"🐷n\" = \"in\" implies that the next word is \"in\".\n\nThen \"😴r🤥-🤫ol🐦🐔🙄🐷an\". 😴=p, so \"pr🤥-🤫ol🐦m🙄i an\". Maybe \"pr...\" like \"prerequisite\" or \"pre-...\". Let's look at \"🤫ol\" part. If 🤫 is a letter, \"🤫ol\" could be \"col\" (if 🤫=c), \"sol\" (s), \"rol\" (r), etc. Let's check the first part again: \"🤫o🤫oa\" — if 🤫=c, then \"co coa\" — \"co coa\" doesn't make sense. Maybe \"lo loa\"? \"lo loa\" — \"lo loa\" is not right. Wait, \"wa🤗\" — if \"wa\" is \"wa\" and the next letter is \"s\", then \"was\". So \"wa🤗\" = \"was\" implies 🤗=s. Let's try that. So \"wa🤗\" = \"was\" → 🤗=s.\n\nNow the sentence becomes:\n\n🤫o🤫oa was an important 🤫o mm o 🐯i t😂 in pr🤥-🤫ol🐦m🙄i an m🤥s oa m🤥r i 🤫a.\n\nLet's check \"important\" — yes, \"im portant\" (🐷=i, 🐔=m, 😴=p, 🤩=o → \"i m p o rtant\" → \"important\"). That works.\n\nNext, \"🤫o mm o 🐯i t😂\" — \"🤫o mm o 🐯i t😂\". Maybe \"component\"? Let's see: \"compo...\" \"compo\" would be \"co mpo\". So \"co mpo\" → \"compo\". So \"🤫o mm o\" would be \"co mmo\"? Hmm, maybe \"com mo...\"? \"common\"? \"common\" is \"com mon\". So \"🤫o mm o\" → \"co mm o\" → \"commo\" (if 🤫=c). Then \"commo\" + \"n\" would be \"common\". So \"🐯i t😂\" could be \"n i t...\"? \"common it...\"? Maybe \"common it...\" No, maybe \"common issue\"? \"issue\" is \"issue\". Let's see. \"🐯i t😂\" — if \"it\" is \"it\", then \"i t\" is \"it\" (since 🐷=i). So \"🐯i t😂\" could be \"k i t...\" (if 🐯=k) but not sure. Let's look at another part.\n\nThe part after \"in pr🤥-🤫ol🐦m🙄i an\" — \"pr🤥\" could be \"pre\" (if 🤥=e). So \"pr🤥\" = \"pre\" → 🤥=e. Then \"pre-🤫ol🐦m🙄i\". \"pre-collegiate\"? \"pre-college\"? Let's see. \"🤫ol\" if 🤫=c, then \"col\". \"col\" → \"col\". So \"pre-col...\". \"col\" + \"lege\" → \"college\". So \"col🐦m🙄i\" → \"col\" + \"le\" + \"g\" + \"i\"? \"college\" is \"college\" (c-o-l-l-e-g-e). Wait, \"col\" (c-o-l) then \"🐦\" would be \"l\", \"m\" (🐔=m) is \"m\", \"🙄\" would be \"e\", \"i\" (🐷=i). So \"col🐦m🙄i\" → \"col l m e i\"? No, \"college\" is c-o-l-l-e-g-e. Maybe \"collegiate\"? Let's see. \"collegiate\" is c-o-l-l-e-g-i-a-t-e. Hmm, perhaps. Let's check the \"an\" at the end of that part: \"an\" could be \"an\" as in the article.\n\nAnother part: \"m🤥s oa m🤥r i 🤫a\". \"m🤥s\" — if 🤥=e, then \"mes\" → \"mes\" (maybe \"mess\" if s is there, but \"m e s\" → \"mes\"? Maybe \"mass\" but \"m a s s\" — no. \"m e s\" could be \"mes\" but not sure. \"oa\" is \"oa\" — maybe \"of a\" or \"or a\". \"m🤥r\" — \"mer\" (if 🤥=e) → \"mer\". \"i 🤫a\" — \"i 🤫a\" could be \"i n a\" (if 🤫=n), but earlier parts don't fit. Alternatively, \"i t a\" (if 🤫=t). Not sure.\n\nLet's go back to the first part: \"🤫o🤫oa\". If \"wa🤗\" is \"was\" (🤗=s), then the first part is a word before \"was\". Let's see: \"🤫o🤫oa was...\" Maybe \"gooda was\"? No. \"Loo loo a was\"? No. \"Too too a was\"? \"Too too a was\" → \"Too too a was an important...\" That could make sense. So \"Too too a was...\" So \"🤫o🤫oa\" would be \"too too a\". Let's check: \"too\" is t-o-o, so if 🤫=t, then \"t o t o a\" → \"totoa\"? No. \"co co a\"? \"co co a was...\" No. \"So so a was...\" → \"So so a was an important...\" That works. \"So so a was...\" So \"🤫o🤫oa\" = \"so so a\". So 🤫=s. Let's check: if 🤫=s, then \"s o s o a\" → \"sosoa\" which is \"so so a\". Oh, \"so so a\" (maybe a typo or \"so, so a...\"). Let's test that.\n\nIf 🤫=s, then:\n\nFirst part: \"s o s o a was an important...\" → \"so so a was an important...\" That's possible.\n\nThen \"🐷🐔😴ortant\" = \"i m p o rtant\" → \"important\" (correct).\n\nNext part: \"s o m m o 🐯i t😂\". \"so mmo...\" → \"so mmo\" → \"somo\"? Maybe \"so mmo\" → \"smmo\" isn't a word. Alternatively, \"s o m m o\" → \"somo\" (no). Let's check \"s o m m o 🐯i t😂\". Maybe \"s o m m o\" is \"somo\" but perhaps \"s o m m o\" is \"summary\"? No. Let's look at \"t😂\". If \"t\" is \"t\", then \"t😂\" could be \"th\" (if 😂=h), \"te\" (e), \"tr\" (r), etc.\n\nAnother part: \"in pr🤥-s o l🐦m🙄i an\". If 🤥=e, then \"pre-sol...\". \"pre-sol\" → \"pre-sol\" (maybe \"pre-solar\"?). \"s o l\" is \"sol\" (sun in Spanish, but maybe \"s o l\" as \"sol\" in English). \"l🐦m🙄i\" → \"l 🐦 m 🙄 i\". If \"🐦\" is \"i\", \"🙄\" is \"d\", then \"limdi\" — no. Maybe \"s o l v e m e n t\" → \"solution\"? Not sure.\n\nLet's check the part \"m🤥s oa m🤥r i s a\". \"m e s oa m e r i s a\" → \"mes oa meri sa\". Maybe \"message of a meri sa\" — no. Alternatively, \"m e s s a g e\" → \"message\" if \"s\" is 🤗=s. So \"m🤥s\" could be \"mes\" (if 🤥=e), then \"message\" would be \"m e s s a g e\". But \"oa\" could be \"of a\" → \"message of a...\".\n\nLet's try another angle. The word \"important\" is correctly broken down as \"im portant\" (i-m-p-o-rtant). So that gives us 🐷=i, 🐔=m, 😴=p, 🤩=o.\n\nThe word \"wa🤗\" — \"wa\" plus a letter. Common words: \"was\" (s), \"war\" (r), \"way\" (y), \"wap\" (p), \"wad\" (d). Since \"was\" is common, let's assume 🤗=s. So \"wa🤗\" = \"was\".\n\nNow, \"an important...\" So \"an important\" makes sense. Then the next part: \"🤫o🐔🐔o🐯🐷t😂\" → \"🤫o m m o 🐯i t😂\". Let's think of \"component\" → \"compo...\" \"compo\" is c-o-m-p-o. But here we have \"🤫o m m o\", so \"c o m m o\" → \"commo\" (common). \"common\" is c-o-m-m-o-n. So \"commo\" + \"n\" would be \"common\". So \"🐯i t😂\" could be \"n i t...\" → \"n i t\" → \"nit\"? \"common it...\" Maybe \"common issue\"? \"issue\" is i-s-s-u-e. Not sure. Let's see \"common it...\" → \"common it\" but that's not a phrase. Maybe \"common in the...\" No.\n\nAnother part: \"🐷n\" = \"i n\" → \"in\". That's correct. So \"in\" is \"i n\".\n\nThe part \"😴r🤥-🤫🤩l🐦🐔🙄🐷an\" → \"p r 🤥 - s o l 🐦 m 🙄 i an\". So \"pr🤥-sol🐦m🙄ian\". Maybe \"pre-sol...\" like \"pre-solar\" or \"pre-solid\". \"pre-sol\" → \"pre-sol\" (if 🤥=e). So \"pr🤥\" = \"pre\" → 🤥=e. Then \"pre-sol🐦m🙄ian\". \"solar\" is s-o-l-a-r. So \"sol\" is s-o-l. Then \"🐦\" could be \"a\" (so \"sola\"), \"m\" (🐔=m) is \"m\", \"🙄\" could be \"r\", \"i\" (🐷=i), \"an\" → \"sola r i an\" → \"solarian\"? Not a word. Maybe \"pre-collegian\"? \"college\" is c-o-l-l-e-g-e. So \"collegian\" is c-o-l-l-e-g-i-a-n. Let's check: \"🤫🤩l\" = s-o-l (if 🤫=s, 🤩=o) → \"sol\". Then \"🐦\" would be \"l\" (so \"soll\"), \"🐔=m\" → \"m\", \"🙄\"=e, \"🐷=i\" → \"i\", \"an\" → \"sollmei an\"? No. \"collegian\" is c-o-l-l-e-g-i-a-n. So \"co\" (c-o) is \"🤫🤩\" (s-o, if 🤫=s, then \"so\" not \"co\"). So maybe 🤫=c. Let's try that.\n\nIf 🤫=c, then:\n\nFirst part: \"c o c o a was an important...\" → \"cocoa was an important...\" That makes sense! \"Cocoa was an important...\" Oh, that's a good fit. \"Cocoa\" is a common word. So \"🤫o🤫oa\" = \"cocoa\" → 🤫=c. Because \"c o c o a\" → \"cocoa\". That's perfect. So 🤫=c.\n\nLet's update: 🤫=c, 🤩=o, 🐷=i, 🐔=m, 😴=p, 🤗=s (from \"wa🤗\" = \"was\").\n\nNow, let's rewrite the entire sentence with these substitutions:\n\nOriginal encoded sentence:\n\n🤫🤩🤫🤩a wa🤗 an 🐷🐔😴🤩rtant 🤫🤩🐔🐔🤩🐯🐷t😂 🐷n 😴r🤥-🤫🤩l🐦🐔🙄🐷an 🐔🤥🤗🤩a🐔🤥r🐷🤫a.\n\nSubstituting knowns (🤫=c, 🤩=o, 🐷=i, 🐔=m, 😴=p, 🤗=s):\n\nc o c o a was an i m p o rtant c o m m o 🐯i t😂 i n p r 🤥-c o l 🐦 m 🙄 i an m 🤥 s o a m 🤥 r i c a.\n\nLet's parse this:\n\n\"cocoa was an important co mmo 🐯it😂 in pr🤥-col🐦m🙄ian m🤥soa m🤥rica.\"\n\nLet's break down \"important\" → \"important\" (i-m-p-o-rtant) correct.\n\n\"co mmo...\" → \"commo...\" → \"common\" (c-o-m-m-o-n). So \"common\" would need \"n\" after \"commo\". So \"🐯i t😂\" → \"n i t...\" → \"nit\"? \"common it...\" No. Maybe \"component\"? \"component\" is c-o-m-p-o-n-e-n-t. But we have \"co mmo...\" → \"commo\" (c-o-m-m-o). \"component\" would be \"compo\" (c-o-m-p-o) but here it's \"commo\".\n\nAnother part: \"pr🤥-col🐦m🙄ian\". \"pr🤥\" could be \"pre\" (if 🤥=e). Let's assume 🤥=e. Then \"pre-col🐦m🙄ian\". \"col\" is c-o-l. \"col\" + \"league\" → \"colleague\"? \"colleague\" is c-o-l-l-e-a-g-u-e. Let's see: \"col🐦m🙄ian\" → \"col l m e i an\" → \"collmeian\" no. \"collegian\" (c-o-l-l-e-g-i-a-n). So \"col l e g i a n\". So \"col🐦m🙄ian\" → \"col l e g i a n\". So 🐦=l, 🙄=g. Let's check:\n\nIf 🐦=l, 🙄=g, then \"col🐦m🙄ian\" → \"col l m g i an\" → \"collm gian\"? No. Maybe \"collegian\" → \"col l e g i a n\". So \"col🐦m🙄ian\" → \"col l e g i a n\". So \"🐦=l\", \"🙄=g\", \"m\" is m, \"i\" is i, \"an\" is an. That would fit: \"collegian\". So \"col l e g i a n\" → \"collegian\". So \"pre-collegian\" → \"precollegian\" (a person before college, maybe). So \"pr🤥-col🐦m🙄ian\" = \"pre-collegian\". That works if 🤥=e, 🐦=l, 🙄=g.\n\nSo far: 🤥=e, 🐦=l, 🙄=g.\n\nNow, let's update the sentence:\n\n\"cocoa was an important common 🐯it😂 in pre-collegian m e s oa m e r i c a.\"\n\n\"m e s oa\" → \"mes oa\" → \"mes oa\" could be \"message of a\" (if \"oa\" is \"of a\"). \"m e s s a g e\" is \"message\", so \"mes\" would be \"mes\" (if \"s\" is 🤗=s, which it is). So \"mes\" + \"sage\" → \"message\". But \"oa\" could be \"of a\". \"message of a...\" Then \"m e r i c a\" → \"merica\" which is \"America\" if \"merica\" is a typo for \"America\". \"America\" is \"America\" (A-m-e-r-i-c-a). So \"m e r i c a\" → \"merica\" → \"America\" (maybe missing the 'A' at the start, but perhaps the encoded sentence has \"America\" as \"merica\" due to a missing letter, but more likely, \"m e r i c a\" is \"America\" if the first letter is 'A', but in our case, the emoji for 'A' would be in the first part. Let's check the last part: \"m🤥r🐷🤫a\" → \"m e r i c a\" → \"merica\" which is \"America\". So \"America\" is \"America\" (A-m-e-r-i-c-a). So perhaps the first letter 'A' is encoded as another emoji, but here we have \"m e r i c a\" → \"merica\", which would be \"America\" if the 'A' is missing, but maybe not. Alternatively, \"m e r i c a\" is \"merica\" as part of a word.\n\nBack to \"important common 🐯it😂\". \"common\" is c-o-m-m-o-n, so \"common\" would need \"n\" after \"commo\". So \"c o m m o n\" → \"common\". So \"🐯i t😂\" → \"n i t...\" → \"nit\" → \"common it...\" No. Maybe \"common trait\"? \"trait\" is t-r-a-i-t. \"t😂\" could be \"tr\" (if 😂=r). So \"t😂\" = \"tr\". Then \"🐯i t😂\" = \"k i t r\" → \"kitr\"? No. Maybe \"common factor\"? \"factor\" is f-a-c-t-o-r. Not matching.\n\nAnother part: \"🐯🐷t😂\" → \"🐯i t😂\". If \"🐯\" is \"f\", then \"f i t...\" → \"fit...\". \"common fit...\" → \"common fit\". Not sure.\n\nLet's look at \"m🤥s oa\" → \"m e s oa\" → \"mes oa\". If \"mes\" is \"mes\" (French for \"my\" but not English), or \"mes\" as in \"mesa\" (table). \"mesa\" is m-e-s-a. So \"mes oa\" → \"mes oa\" → \"mesa oa\" no. \"message of a\" → \"message of a...\" makes sense. So \"m e s s a g e\" → \"message\" would require \"s\" (🤗=s) again. So \"m🤥s\" = \"m e s\" → \"mes\" (needs another 's' to be \"mess\"). \"oa\" could be \"of a\" → \"message of a...\".\n\nThe last part: \"m🤥r🐷🤫a\" → \"m e r i c a\" → \"merica\" → \"America\" (if the first letter is 'A'). So \"America\" is a country, so \"m e r i c a\" → \"America\". That's a good fit. So \"m e r i c a\" = \"America\".\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n\"cocoa was an important common [something] in pre-collegian message of a [something] America.\"\n\nBut let's check the original encoded sentence again with all substitutions so far:\n\nEncoded with substitutions:\n\nc o c o a was an i m p o rtant c o m m o 🐯i t😂 i n p r e - c o l l m g i an m e s o a m e r i c a.\n\nWait, \"🐦=l\" and \"🙄=g\", so \"col🐦m🙄ian\" is \"col l m g i an\" → \"collmgian\". That doesn't make sense. Maybe \"collegian\" is c-o-l-l-e-g-i-a-n. So \"col l e g i a n\". So \"col🐦m🙄ian\" would need \"e\" where \"m\" is. But \"m\" is 🐔=m. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let's try \"collegian\" again. \"collegian\" is c-o-l-l-e-g-i-a-n. So the letters after \"col\" are \"l\", \"e\", \"g\", \"i\", \"a\", \"n\". So \"col🐦🙄i an\" → \"col l e g i an\" → \"collegian\". So if \"🐦=l\" and \"🙄=e\", then \"col l e g i an\" → \"collegian\". Oh, that's better. So \"col🐦🙄i an\" = \"collegian\". So \"🐦=l\", \"🙄=e\". Then \"pr🤥-col🐦🙄i an\" → \"pre-collegian\". That works! So \"pr🤥\" = \"pre\" → 🤥=e, \"col🐦🙄i an\" = \"collegian\" (col l e g i an? No, \"collegian\" is c-o-l-l-e-g-i-a-n. So \"col l e g i a n\". So \"col🐦🙄i an\" would be \"col l e g i an\". So \"🐦=l\", \"🙄=g\", \"i\" is i, \"an\" is an. Then \"col l e g i an\" → \"collegian\". That makes sense. So \"pr🤥-col🐦🙄i an\" = \"pre-collegian\".\n\nSo \"pr🤥\" = \"pre\" (🤥=e), \"col🐦🙄i an\" = \"collegian\" (🐦=l, 🙄=g).\n\nNow, let's check \"c o m m o 🐯i t😂\". \"common\" is c-o-m-m-o-n. So \"c o m m o n\" → \"common\". So \"🐯i t😂\" → \"n i t...\" → \"nit\" → \"common it...\" No. Maybe \"common factor\"? \"factor\" is f-a-c-t-o-r. \"t😂\" could be \"or\" (😂=r), then \"factor\" → \"f a c t o r\". So \"🐯i t😂\" = \"f a c t o r\"? No, \"🐯i\" is \"f a\" (if 🐯=f, i=a? But 🐷=i, so i is i. So \"🐯i\" = \"f i\". \"f i t😂\" → \"fit or\" (if 😂=r). \"common fit or...\" No.\n\nAnother part: \"m🤥s oa\" → \"m e s oa\" → \"mes oa\". If \"mes\" is \"mes\" and \"oa\" is \"of a\", maybe \"message of a\" → \"message of a...\". \"m e s s a g e\" → \"message\" would need \"s\" (🤗=s), so \"m e s s\" → \"mess\". So \"m🤥s\" = \"m e s s\" → \"mess\" (if \"s\" is 🤗=s). So \"m e s s\" → \"mess\". Then \"oa\" = \"ag\" (if o=a, but o is 🤩=o. No. \"oa\" could be \"ag\" (if o=a, but no). Alternatively, \"oa\" is \"of a\" → \"message of a...\".\n\nThe last part: \"m🤥r🐷🤫a\" → \"m e r i c a\" → \"merica\" → \"America\". That's a good fit. So \"America\" is the country.\n\nLet's try to guess the remaining emojis. The emojis we have so far:\n\n🤫=c, 🤩=o (given), 🐷=i, 🐔=m, 😴=p, 🤗=s, 🤥=e, 🐦=l, 🙄=g, 😂=? (from \"t😂\"), 🐯=? (from \"🐯i\").\n\nLet's look at \"c o c o a\" → \"cocoa\" (correct). \"wa🤗\" = \"was\" (correct). \"an important\" (correct). \"c o m m o 🐯i t😂\" → \"common 🐯it😂\". Let's think of \"common ingredient\". \"ingredient\" is i-n-g-r-e-d-i-e-n-t. But \"i t😂\" → \"it...\". \"common trait\" → \"trait\" is t-r-a-i-t. So \"t😂\" could be \"r\" (😂=r), making \"t r\" → \"tr\". So \"trait\" is t-r-a-i-t. So \"t😂\" = \"tr\" → 😂=r. Then \"🐯i t😂\" → \"k i t r\" → \"kitr\"? No. Maybe \"common factor\" → \"factor\" is f-a-c-t-o-r. \"factor\" → \"f a c t o r\". So \"🐯i\" = \"f a\" (if 🐯=f, i=a) but i is already 🐷=i. So \"🐯i\" = \"f i\" → \"fi\". \"factor\" is f-a-c-t-o-r. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother angle: \"c o m m o 🐯i t😂\" → \"common practice\". \"practice\" is p-r-a-c-t-i-c-e. No. \"common product\" → \"product\" is p-r-o-d-u-c-t. No. \"common issue\" → \"issue\" is i-s-s-u-e. \"i t😂\" → \"it...\" → \"it s...\" (if 😂=s) → \"its\". \"common its...\" No.\n\nLet's check the part \"🐔🤥🤗🤩a🐔🤥r🐷🤫a\" → \"m e s o a m e r i c a\" → \"mesoamerica\". Oh! \"Mesoamerica\" is a region. Let's see: \"m e s o a m e r i c a\" → \"Mesoamerica\". Yes! \"Mesoamerica\" is spelled M-e-s-o-a-m-e-r-i-c-a. That's a perfect fit. So \"m e s o a m e r i c a\" = \"Mesoamerica\". So the last part is \"Mesoamerica\".\n\nSo \"🐔🤥🤗🤩a🐔🤥r🐷🤫a\" → \"m e s o a m e r i c a\" → \"Mesoamerica\". That works. So \"m e s o a m e r i c a\" = \"Mesoamerica\".\n\nNow, let's check the part before that: \"😴r🤥-🤫🤩l🐦🐔🙄🐷an\" → \"p r e - c o l l m g i an\" → \"pre-collegian\" (if \"collmgian\" is a typo, but maybe it's \"pre-collegian\"). But \"Mesoamerica\" is correct.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence would be:\n\n\"Cocoa was an important common [something] in pre-collegian Mesoamerica.\"\n\nBut let's check the entire substituted sentence again:\n\nc o c o a was an i m p o rtant c o m m o 🐯i t😂 i n p r e - c o l l m g i an m e s o a m e r i c a.\n\nBreaking into words:\n\n- \"cocoa\" (c o c o a)\n- \"was\" (wa s)\n- \"an\" (an)\n- \"important\" (i m p o rtant)\n- \"common\" (c o m m o [needs n])\n- \"🐯it😂\" (unknown)\n- \"in\" (i n)\n- \"pre-collegian\" (pr e - col l m g i an) → maybe \"precollegian\" (a person before college)\n- \"Mesoamerica\" (m e s o a m e r i c a)\n\nAssuming \"common\" is correct, then \"c o m m o n\" → \"common\", so \"🐯i t😂\" must end with \"n\". So \"🐯i t😂\" = \"n i t...\" → \"nit\" → \"common it...\" No. Maybe \"common trait\" → \"trait\" is t-r-a-i-t. So \"t😂\" = \"r a i t\" → but that's multiple letters. Each emoji is a single letter, so \"😂\" is one letter.\n\nLet's think of \"c o m m o 🐯i t😂\" as \"common trait\". \"trait\" is t-r-a-i-t. So \"t😂\" would be \"r\" (😂=r) → \"t r\", then \"a i t\" would need other emojis, but we don't have those. Alternatively, \"common factor\" → \"factor\" is f-a-c-t-o-r. \"🐯i\" = \"f a\" (🐯=f, i=a), but i is already 🐷=i. So no.\n\nAnother possibility: \"c o m m o 🐯i t😂\" → \"common ingredient\". \"ingredient\" is i-n-g-r-e-d-i-e-n-t. \"i t😂\" → \"i e n t\" (but 😂 would be multiple letters). No.\n\nAlternatively, \"c o m m o 🐯i t😂\" → \"common feature\". \"feature\" is f-e-a-t-u-r-e. No.\n\nMaybe \"c o m m o 🐯i t😂\" is \"common item\". \"item\" is i-t-e-m. So \"i t😂\" → \"i t e\" (😂=e) → \"ite\". \"common ite...\" No. \"common item\" → \"i t e m\". So \"😂=m\", but \"m\" is already 🐔=m. So no.\n\nLet's try to guess the remaining emojis. The emojis we need to find are:\n\n🐯, 😂.\n\nFrom \"Mesoamerica\" we have all the letters accounted for except maybe \"🐯\" and \"😂\".\n\nLet's check \"🐯i t😂\". If \"common\" is \"c o m m o n\", then \"n\" would be the next letter. So \"🐯i t😂\" → \"n i t...\" → \"nit\" → \"common nit...\" No. Maybe \"common unit\" → \"unit\" is u-n-i-t. So \"i t😂\" → \"i t\" (😂=u) → \"it u\". No.\n\nAlternatively, \"c o m m o 🐯i t😂\" could be \"common factor\". \"factor\" is f-a-c-t-o-r. \"factor\" → \"f a c t o r\". So \"🐯i\" = \"f a\" (🐯=f, i=a). But i is 🐷=i, so a is a different emoji. We don't have a emoji for 'a' yet. The first part has \"a\" as a letter: \"🤫🤩🤫🤩a\" → \"c o c o a\" → \"a\" is just 'a' (maybe the emoji for 'a' is not present, or 'a' is a literal in the encoded sentence. Wait, the encoded sentence has \"a\" as a literal? Let me check the original encoded sentence:\n\nOriginal: 🤫🤩🤫🤩a wa🤗 an 🐷🐔😴🤩rtant 🤫🤩🐔🐔🤩🐯🐷t😂 🐷n 😴r🤥-🤫🤩l🐦🐔🙄🐷an 🐔🤥🤗🤩a🐔🤥r🐷🤫a.\n\nAh, there are some 'a's as literals. So \"a\" is a letter in the sentence, not an emoji. So the 'a's are already decoded. So \"c o c o a\" has 'a' as a literal. So the emoji for 'a' is not used here; 'a' is written as 'a'. That's important.\n\nSo \"c o c o a\" → \"cocoa\" (c-o-c-o-a), where 'a' is a literal. So the emojis are only replacing letters, and some letters (like 'a') are written as literals. That explains why 'a' is in the encoded sentence.\n\nSo \"wa🤗\" → \"wa\" (literals) + 🤗=s → \"was\".\n\n\"an\" → \"an\" (literals).\n\n\"rtant\" → \"rtant\" (literals) → \"rtant\" is part of \"important\" (i-m-p-o-rtant).\n\nSo \"i m p o rtant\" → \"important\".\n\n\"c o m m o 🐯i t😂\" → \"commo\" (c-o-m-m-o) + \"🐯i t😂\" → \"commo\" + [emoji letters] → \"common\" if \"🐯i t😂\" includes 'n'.\n\nSo \"commo\" + \"n...\" → \"common\". So \"🐯i t😂\" → \"n i t...\" → \"nit\" → \"common it...\" No. Maybe \"commonly\" → \"commonly\" is c-o-m-m-o-n-l-y. So \"commo\" + \"n l y\" → \"commonly\". So \"🐯i t😂\" = \"n l y\". So \"🐯=n\", \"i=l\", \"t=y\", but i is already 🐷=i. So no.\n\nAlternatively, \"commodity\" → \"commodity\" is c-o-m-m-o-d-i-t-y. So \"commo\" + \"d i t y\" → \"commodity\". So \"🐯i t😂\" = \"d i t y\". So \"🐯=d\", \"i=i\", \"t=t\", \"😂=y\". So \"d i t y\" → \"dity\". \"commodity\" → \"commodity\". That works! Let's check:\n\n\"c o m m o d i t y\" → \"commodity\". So \"🐯=d\", \"i=i\" (🐷=i), \"t=t\", \"😂=y\". So \"🐯i t😂\" = \"d i t y\" → \"dity\". So \"commodity\" → \"commodity\". That's a perfect fit!\n\nYes! \"commodity\" is an important item, and \"cocoa was an important common commodity in pre-collegian Mesoamerica.\" That makes sense. So \"c o m m o d i t y\" → \"commodity\". So:\n\n🐯=d (since \"🐯i\" = \"d i\"), 😂=y (since \"t😂\" = \"t y\").\n\nLet's verify:\n\n\"🤫🤩🐔🐔🤩🐯🐷t😂\" → c o m m o d i t y → \"commodity\". Yes! That's exactly \"commodity\". So \"c o m m o d i t y\" → \"commodity\". Perfect!\n\nSo now we have:\n\n🐯=d, 😂=y.\n\nLet's check all substitutions:\n\n🤫=c, 🤩=o (given), 🐷=i, 🐔=m, 😴=p, 🤗=s, 🤥=e, 🐦=l, 🙄=g, 🐯=d, 😂=y.\n\nLet's reconstruct the entire sentence:\n\nEncoded: 🤫🤩🤫🤩a wa🤗 an 🐷🐔😴🤩rtant 🤫🤩🐔🐔🤩🐯🐷t😂 🐷n 😴r🤥-🤫🤩l🐦🐔🙄🐷an 🐔🤥🤗🤩a🐔🤥r🐷🤫a.\n\nSubstituting:\n\nc o c o a was an i m p o rtant c o m m o d i t y i n p r e - c o l l m g i an m e s o a m e r i c a.\n\nBreaking into words:\n\n- coc oa → cocoa (cocoa)\n- wa s → was\n- an → an\n- i m p o rtant → important\n- c o m m o d i t y → commodity\n- i n → in\n- p r e - c o l l m g i an → pre-collegian (assuming \"collmgian\" is a typo or part of the word, but \"pre-collegian\" makes sense)\n- m e s o a m e r i c a → Mesoamerica\n\nPutting it all together: \"Cocoa was an important common commodity in pre-collegian Mesoamerica.\"\n\nThat makes sense. Cocoa was indeed an important commodity in Mesoamerica, and \"pre-collegian\" might refer to the time before college, but more likely, \"pre-collegian\" could be a typo for \"pre-Columbian\" (before Columbus). Oh! \"pre-Columbian\" is a common term referring to the time before Columbus arrived in the Americas. Let's check that.\n\n\"pre-collegian\" vs \"pre-Columbian\". \"Columbian\" is c-o-l-u-m-b-i-a-n. So \"columbian\" → \"c o l u m b i a n\". So \"😴r🤥-🤫🤩l🐦🐔🙄🐷an\" → \"p r e - c o l l m g i an\". If \"l🐦🐔🙄🐷an\" is \"l u m b i an\", then:\n\n\"l🐦\" = \"l u\" → 🐦=u,\n\n\"🐔🙄\" = \"m b\" → 🙄=b,\n\n\"🐷an\" = \"i an\" → \"ian\".\n\nSo \"pre-columbian\" → \"pre-columbian\". That's a better fit. Let's adjust:\n\nIf \"pre-columbian\", then:\n\n\"p r e - c o l u m b i an\".\n\nSo:\n\n😴r🤥 = p r e → 😴=p, 🤥=e (correct),\n\n🤫🤩l = c o l → 🤫=c, 🤩=o, l=l (so 🐦=u? Because \"l🐦\" = \"l u\" → 🐦=u),\n\n🐔🙄 = m b → 🐔=m, 🙄=b,\n\n🐷an = i an → 🐷=i (correct).\n\nSo \"l🐦\" = l u → 🐦=u,\n\n\"🐔🙄\" = m b → 🙄=b,\n\nThen \"c o l u m b i an\" → \"columbian\".\n\nThat would make the sentence: \"Cocoa was an important common commodity in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica.\"\n\nThat's a much better fit. Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica is a well-known historical region where cocoa was indeed an important commodity.\n\nSo let's adjust the earlier guesses:\n\n🐦=u, 🙄=b.\n\nLet's recheck the substitutions with this:\n\n😴=p, 🤥=e, 🤫=c, 🤩=o, 🐷=i, 🐔=m, 🐦=u, 🙄=b, 🐯=d, 😂=y, 🤗=s.\n\nNow, the sentence becomes:\n\nc o c o a was an i m p o rtant c o m m o d i t y i n p r e - c o l u m b i an m e s o a m e r i c a.\n\nBreaking into words:\n\n- cocoa (cocoa)\n- was (was)\n- an (an)\n- important (important)\n- commodity (commodity)\n- in (in)\n- pre-columbian (pre-columbian)\n- Mesoamerica (Mesoamerica)\n\nYes! That's a perfect sentence: \"Cocoa was an important common commodity in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica.\"\n\nLet's verify each part:\n\n- 🤫🤩🤫🤩a → c o c o a → cocoa ✔️\n- wa🤗 → wa s → was ✔️\n- an → an ✔️\n- 🐷🐔😴🤩rtant → i m p o rtant → important ✔️\n- 🤫🤩🐔🐔🤩🐯🐷t😂 → c o m m o d i t y → commodity ✔️\n- 🐷n → i n → in ✔️\n- 😴r🤥-🤫🤩l🐦🐔🙄🐷an → p r e - c o l u m b i an → pre-columbian ✔️\n- 🐔🤥🤗🤩a🐔🤥r🐷🤫a → m e s o a m e r i c a → Mesoamerica ✔️\n\nAll parts fit perfectly. So the emojis correspond to:\n\n🤫=c, 🤩=o, 🐷=i, 🐔=m, 😴=p, 🤗=s, 🤥=e, 🐦=u, 🙄=b, 🐯=d, 😂=y.\n\n🤫=c,🤩=o,🐷=i,🐔=m,😴=p,🤗=s,🤥=e,🐦=u,🙄=b,🐯=d,😂=y\nAnswer: 🤫=c,🤩=o,🐷=i,🐔=m,😴=p,🤗=s,🤥=e,🐦=u,🙄=b,🐯=d,😂=y"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The word \"later\" is there, which makes sense. Then \"beca🤠e\" – that's probably \"became\", so the 🤠 emoji would be 'm' because \"became\" is b-e-c-a-m-e. So 🤠=m.\n\nNext, \"a j😂dge\" – that's \"a judge\". So \"j😂dge\" is \"judge\", so the 😂 emoji is 'u' (since j-u-d-g-e). So 😂=u.\n\nThen \"o🥳 the\" – \"o🥳\" might be \"of the\", so \"o🥳\" is \"of\", so 🥳=f. Let's check: \"o🥳\" becomes \"of\", so 🥳=f. Let's verify other parts with this. \n\nLooking at \"t🤗le🥳t\" which we replaced to \"tale🥳t\". If 🥳=f, then \"taleft\"? Wait, \"tale\" plus \"f\" and \"t\" – maybe \"tale\" plus \"f\" and \"t\" is \"taleft\"? Hmm, maybe not. Let's check another part: \"osbo😂r🥳e\". We have 😂=u, 🥳=f. So \"osboru\" + \"f\" + \"e\"? \"osborufe\"? Maybe \"osborne\"? Let's see: o-s-b-o-r-u-f-e? Osborne is a name, maybe. O-s-b-o-r-n-e. Oh, wait, \"osbo😂r🥳e\" would be o-s-b-o-😂-r-🥳-e. If 😂=u, then o-s-b-o-u-r-🥳-e. If 🥳=n, then \"osborne\" (o-s-b-o-u-r-n-e). That makes sense! Let's check that.\n\nIf 🥳=n, then \"o🥳\" would be \"on\" (o-n), which fits \"on the t...\". Let's try that. Let's re-examine:\n\nIf 🤗=a, then \"beca🤠e\" is \"became\" (b-e-c-a-m-e), so 🤠=m. Then \"j😂dge\" is \"judge\" (j-u-d-g-e), so 😂=u. \"t🤗le🥳t\" is \"tale🥳t\". If \"tale\" is part of it, maybe \"tale\" plus \"n\" (if 🥳=n) gives \"taletn\"? No, maybe \"tale\" plus \"n\" and \"t\" – \"taletn t\"? Maybe \"tale\" plus \"n\" and \"t\" is \"talen t\"? Alternatively, \"tale\" plus \"n\" and \"t\" could be \"taleant\"? Not sure. Let's look at \"osbo😂r🥳e\". If 😂=u, then o-s-b-o-u-r-🥳-e. If that's a name like \"Osborne\", then \"Osborne\" is O-s-b-o-r-n-e. So the letters would be o-s-b-o-r-n-e. So the sequence is o-s-b-o-😂-r-🥳-e. So after o-s-b-o, the next letter is u (😂), then r, then 🥳, then e. So \"osboru\" + 🥳 + \"e\". To get \"Osborne\", it would be o-s-b-o-r-n-e. So the part after \"osbo\" is \"ru\" (r and u), then \"n\" (🥳), then e. So \"osboru\" + \"n\" + \"e\" = Osborne. That works! So 🥳=n.\n\nLet's check that. So \"o🥳\" would be \"on\" (o-n), which fits \"on the t...\". Then \"t🤗le🥳t\" is \"tale\" + n + t → \"taletn t\"? Maybe \"taleant\"? Alternatively, \"tale\" + \"n\" + \"t\" could be \"taleant\" but that's not a word. Let's check \"shows the 🦆 factor a🥳d a🤠er🐻ca's got tale🥳t\". \"a🥳d\" with 🥳=n is \"and\", which is correct! Oh, that's a good one. \"a🥳d\" becomes \"and\" (a-n-d). Perfect. So 🥳=n. That makes sense. So \"a🥳d\" is \"and\".\n\nThen \"a🤠er🐻ca's\" – 🤠=m (from \"became\"), so \"a🤠er\" is \"am\" + \"er\"? Wait, \"a🤠er\" would be a-m-e-r? \"amer...\" Maybe \"American\"? Let's see. \"a🤠er🐻ca's\" – a-m-e-r-🐻-c-a's. So \"American's\" would be a-m-e-r-i-c-a's. So 🐻=i. Because \"American\" is a-m-e-r-i-c-a. So \"a🤠er🐻ca's\" becomes \"American's\". That works! So 🐻=i.\n\nLet's recap so far:\n\n🤗=a (given)\n\n😂=u (from \"judge\": j-u-d-g-e)\n\n🤠=m (from \"became\": b-e-c-a-m-e)\n\n🥳=n (from \"and\": a-n-d)\n\n🐻=i (from \"American's\": a-m-e-r-i-c-a's)\n\nNow let's check the rest. The encoded sentence with these replacements:\n\nOriginal: osbo😂r🥳e l🤗ter bec🤗🤠e 🤗 j😂dge o🥳 the t🤗le🥳t shows the 🦆 f🤗ctor 🤗🥳d 🤗🤠er🐻c🤗's got t🤗le🥳t.\n\nAfter replacements:\n\nosboru n e (osbo😂r🥳e → o-s-b-o-u-r-n-e → Osborne) \n\nl a ter (l🤗ter → later) \n\nbec a m e (bec🤗🤠e → became) \n\na (🤗) \n\nj u dge (j😂dge → judge) \n\no n (o🥳 → on) \n\nthe t a le n t (t🤗le🥳t → tal ent? \"talent\" maybe. t-a-l-e-n-t → talent. Oh! That's right. \"tale\" + \"nt\" → \"talent\". So \"t🤗le🥳t\" is \"talent\" (t-a-l-e-n-t). Perfect.\n\nSo \"the t a le n t\" → \"the talent\".\n\nThen \"shows the 🦆 f a ctor (f🤗ctor → factor) a n d (🤗🥳d → and) a m e r i c a 's (🤗🤠er🐻c🤗's → American's) got t a le n t (t🤗le🥳t → talent).\"\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n\"Osborne later became a judge on the talent shows the 🦆 factor and American's got talent.\"\n\nNow, \"shows the 🦆 factor\" – \"factor\" is there, so \"the 🦆 factor\" could be \"the key factor\" or \"the main factor\" etc. Let's see. The word before \"factor\" is \"f🤗ctor\" which we replaced to \"factor\" (f-a-c-t-o-r). So \"f🤗ctor\" is \"factor\". Then \"the 🦆 factor\" – what's a common word here? Maybe \"the key factor\" (so 🦆=k) or \"the real factor\" (🦆=r), but let's check the sentence flow. \"Osborne later became a judge on the talent shows the [X] factor and American's got talent.\" The X Factor is a real TV show! Oh right, \"The X Factor\" is a talent show. So \"the 🦆 factor\" is \"the X factor\", so 🦆=x.\n\nThat fits perfectly. So 🦆=x.\n\nLet's verify all parts again:\n\nEncoded Sentence replaced:\n\nosbo😂r🥳e → Osborne (o-s-b-o-u-r-n-e)\n\nl🤗ter → later (l-a-ter)\n\nbec🤗🤠e → became (b-e-c-a-m-e)\n\n🤗 → a\n\nj😂dge → judge (j-u-dge)\n\no🥳 → on (o-n)\n\nthe t🤗le🥳t → the talent (t-a-l-e-n-t)\n\nshows the 🦆 f🤗ctor → shows the X factor (X is 🦆, factor is f-a-c-tor)\n\n🤗🥳d → and (a-n-d)\n\n🤗🤠er🐻c🤗's → American's (a-m-e-r-i-c-a's)\n\ngot t🤗le🥳t → got talent (t-a-l-e-n-t)\n\nSo the full decoded sentence would be: \"Osborne later became a judge on the talent shows the X factor and American's got talent.\"\n\nThat makes sense.

If it's \"appeals\", then the structure would be a p p e a [l] s. So the missing emoji (🐶) would be 'l' here. Because a ppe a l s → a p p e a l s → \"appeals\". That makes sense. So maybe 🐶=l.\n\n3. 🤔o be → [emoji]o be. Could be \"to be\"? Then 🤔=t. Let's check. If 🤔=t, then \"to be\" fits here. That's a common phrase.\n\n4. 🐨 genuine c🐨se → a genuine c a se → \"a genuine case\". Oh, \"case\" is c a s e. So c a s e → c a [s] e. The emoji after c is 🐨 (a), then the next is se. Wait, \"c🐨se\" is c a [emoji] e. So \"case\" would be c a s e. So the missing emoji here (the one after a) would be 's'. But the emoji in \"c🐨se\" is the one between a and e. Let's check: c🐨se is c a [emoji] e. If that's \"case\", then [emoji] is 's'. So the emoji here is 👻? Wait, the part is \"o👻 🐨n\" → o [emoji] a n. Let's see the full sentence after replacing 🐨=a:\n\nThe original sentence after replacement:\n\npsyche a ppe a a s t o be a genuine c a se o👻 a n expose🥺 me t a 🐮🐮ic co a e 👻 a om a 🐮 a a ge a 🥺i👻👻e a en t i a t e 🥺 p a a en t bo🥺y.\n\nLet me try to parse parts step by step.\n\nLooking at \"c🐨se\" → c a [emoji] e. If that's \"case\", then the emoji is 's'. But where is that emoji? Let's check the original sentence again. The part is \"genuine c🐨se o👻 🐨n\" → \"genuine c a [emoji] e o [emoji] a n\". So \"c a [emoji] e\" would be \"case\" (c a s e), so [emoji] here is 's'. What's the emoji in that position? Let's check the original: \"c🐨se\" → \"c\" followed by 🐨 (a), then the next emoji is 👻? Wait, original: \"c🐨se\" is \"c\" + 🐨 + \"se\"? Wait, maybe I'm splitting the words wrong. Let's look at the original encoded sentence again:\n\nOriginal: \"psyche 🐨ppe🐨🐶s 🤔o be 🐨 genuine c🐨se o👻 🐨n expose🥺 me🤔🐨🐮🐮ic co🐶e 👻🐶om 🐨 🐮🐨🐶ge🐶 🥺i👻👻e🐶en🤔i🐨🤔e🥺 p🐨🐶en🤔 bo🥺y.\"\n\nLet's split into words (assuming spaces are word separators):\n\n1. psyche\n2. 🐨ppe🐨🐶s → a ppe a [emoji] s\n3. 🤔o → [emoji] o\n4. be\n5. 🐨 → a\n6. genuine\n7. c🐨se → c a [emoji] e\n8. o👻 → o [emoji]\n9. 🐨n → a n\n10. expose🥺 → expose [emoji]\n11. me🤔🐨🐮🐮ic → me [emoji] a [emoji][emoji] ic\n12. co🐶e → co [emoji] e\n13. 👻🐶om → [emoji][emoji] om\n14. 🐨 → a\n15. 🐮🐨🐶ge🐶 → [emoji] a [emoji] ge [emoji]\n16. 🥺i👻👻e🐶en🤔i🐨🤔e🥺 → [emoji]i [emoji][emoji]e [emoji]en [emoji]i a [emoji]e [emoji]\n17. p🐨🐶en🤔 → p a [emoji] en [emoji]\n18. bo🥺y → bo [emoji] y\n\nStarting with word 2: 🐨ppe🐨🐶s → a ppe a [emoji] s. Let's think of a word that fits. The structure is a-p-p-e-a-[letter]-s. Let's see: \"appeals\" → a-p-p-e-a-l-s. Oh! That's a possible fit. So a p p e a l s → \"appeals\". So the missing emoji (🐶) here would be 'l'. Let's tentatively say 🐶=l.\n\nWord 3: 🤔o → [emoji]o. Common words here could be \"to\" (t o). So if 🤔=t, then \"to be\" (word 3 and 4) makes sense: \"to be a genuine...\" That's a common phrase. So 🤔=t is a good guess.\n\nWord 7: c🐨se → c a [emoji] e. If 🐨=a, then \"c a [emoji] e\" could be \"case\" (c-a-s-e). So the emoji here (which is the one after a) would be 's'. Let's check the emoji in that position. The original word is \"c🐨se\" → c + 🐨 (a) + [emoji] + e. So the emoji between a and e is 👻? Wait, no, the original sentence after \"genuine\" is \"c🐨se o👻 🐨n\". So \"c🐨se\" is \"c\" followed by 🐨 (a), then \"se\"? Or is the structure \"c\" + 🐨 (a) + [emoji] + \"se\"? Maybe I need to check the exact characters. Let's list the original encoded sentence again, breaking down each character (assuming each space is a word separator, and emojis are individual characters):\n\nEncoded Sentence: psyche 🐨 p p e 🐨 🐶 s 🤔 o b e 🐨 g e n u i n e c 🐨 s e o 👻 🐨 n e x p o s e 🥺 m e 🤔 🐨 🐮 🐮 i c c o 🐶 e 👻 🐶 o m 🐨 🐮 🐨 🐶 g e 🐶 🥺 i 👻 👻 e 🐶 e n 🤔 i 🐨 🤔 e 🥺 p 🐨 🐶 e n 🤔 b o 🥺 y .\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in splitting the words. Let's re-split the original sentence correctly, considering that emojis are individual characters and the sentence is a continuous string with spaces separating words. Let's split the encoded sentence into words (split by spaces):\n\n1. psyche\n2. 🐨ppe🐨🐶s → characters: 🐨, p, p, e, 🐨, 🐶, s\n3. 🤔o → 🤔, o\n4. be\n5. 🐨\n6. genuine\n7. c🐨se → c, 🐨, s, e? Wait, no. Let's check: \"c🐨se\" → c, 🐨, s, e? Or is it c, 🐨, [emoji], e? Because \"se\" is two letters. Let's check the original: \"c🐨se\" → c followed by 🐨 (a), then \"se\" (s and e). Wait, that would make \"c a s e\" → \"case\". Oh! That's possible. So \"c🐨se\" is c + 🐨 (a) + s + e → \"case\". So that part is correct. Then \"case\" is c a s e. So the \"se\" is just s and e, not an emoji. So maybe I was overcomplicating that.\n\nWord 2: 🐨 p p e 🐨 🐶 s → a p p e a [emoji] s. So a p p e a [x] s. What word fits here? Let's see: \"appeals\" is a-p-p-e-a-l-s. So [x] would be 'l', so the emoji 🐶=l. That fits.\n\nWord 3: 🤔 o → [emoji] o. If it's \"to\", then 🤔=t. Then \"to be\" (word 3 and 4) is \"to be\", which is correct. So that's a good fit.\n\nWord 8: o 👻 → o [emoji]. Let's look at the context. After \"case o👻 a n\" → \"case o [emoji] a n\". Maybe \"case of a n...\"? If \"o👻\" is \"of\", then 👻=f. Because o + f = of. So 👻=f. Let's check that. If 👻=f, then \"o👻\" is \"of\". That would make \"case of a n...\" which makes sense.\n\nWord 9: 🐨n → a n → \"an\", which is correct.\n\nWord 10: expose🥺 → expose [emoji]. Let's think of a word ending with \"expose\" followed by a letter. Maybe \"expose me\" but that's later. Wait, word 10 is \"expose🥺\", and word 11 is \"me🤔🐨🐮🐮ic\". Let's look at word 11: \"me🤔🐨🐮🐮ic\" → me [emoji] a [emoji][emoji] ic. If 🤔=t, then \"me t a [x][y] ic\". Maybe \"mechanical\"? Let's see: me t a [c][h] ic → \"mechanical\". So \"mechanical\" is m-e-c-h-a-n-i-c-a-l... Wait, no. Let's try: \"me t a [x][y] ic\". If \"mechanical\" is m-e-c-h-a-n-i-c, but maybe \"metallic\"? m-e-t-a-l-l-i-c. Oh! \"metallic\" is m-e-t-a-l-l-i-c. Let's check: \"me🤔🐨🐮🐮ic\" → me + 🤔 (t) + 🐨 (a) + 🐮 + 🐮 + ic. So me t a [emoji][emoji] ic. If \"metallic\" is m-e-t-a-l-l-i-c, then the two 🐮 emojis would be 'l's. So 🐮=l. But wait, we previously thought 🐶=l. Oh, but emojis are unique per letter. So each emoji corresponds to a unique letter, so if 🐶=l, then 🐮 can't be l. So that's a conflict. Let's backtrack.\n\nAlternative for word 11: \"me🤔🐨🐮🐮ic\" → me [t] a [x][x] ic. Maybe \"medallic\"? No, \"medallic\" is m-e-d-a-l-l-i-c. But \"me t a...\" would be \"meta...\". \"metallic\" is m-e-t-a-l-l-i-c. So if \"me t a l l ic\" → \"metallic\". So that would require 🐮=l, but if 🐶=l, that's a problem. So perhaps my initial guess for 🐶 is wrong.\n\nLet's go back to word 2: 🐨ppe🐨🐶s → a p p e a [x] s. What other 7-letter words start with \"appea\"? \"Appeals\" is a 7-letter word (a-p-p-e-a-l-s). \"Appease\" is a-p-p-e-a-s-e, but that's 7 letters, but ends with 'ease', but the word ends with 's' here. So \"appeals\" is a better fit. So maybe 🐶=l is correct, and then the two 🐮s in word 11 are another letter.\n\nWord 12: co🐶e → co [x] e. If 🐶=l, then \"co l e\". \"Cole\" is a name, but maybe \"code\"? If 🐶=d, then \"code\". But that conflicts with the earlier. Let's think again. If word 2 is \"appeals\" (a-p-p-e-a-l-s), then 🐶=l. Then word 12: co🐶e → co l e. \"Cole\" could be a word, but maybe \"come\"? No, \"come\" is c-o-m-e. Alternatively, \"cope\"? c-o-p-e. But that's not matching. Alternatively, \"core\"? c-o-r-e. So if 🐶=r, then \"core\". But then word 2 would be a-p-p-e-a-r-s → \"appears\"? Oh! \"Appears\" is a-p-p-e-a-r-s. That's a 7-letter word. \"Appears\" makes sense. Let's check that. If 🐶=r, then word 2 is 🐨ppe🐨🐶s → a p p e a r s → \"appears\". That's a good fit. \"To be a genuine case of an expose...\" Maybe \"psyche appears to be a genuine case of an expose...\" That makes sense. So maybe 🐶=r. Let's adjust.\n\nSo word 2: a p p e a r s → \"appears\" → 🐶=r. That's possible. Then word 12: co🐶e → co r e → \"core\". That could work. \"core\" is a common word.\n\nWord 3: 🤔o → [x] o. If \"to\" → 🤔=t. So \"to be a genuine case...\" → that's good.\n\nWord 8: o👻 → o [x]. If \"of\" → 👻=f. So \"case of an...\" → \"case of an expose...\". That fits. \"expose\" is a word, so word 10: \"expose🥺\" → \"expose [x]\". Let's see word 18: \"bo🥺y\" → bo [x] y. If \"boy\" is b-o-y, but \"bo [x] y\" → maybe \"body\"? b-o-d-y. So if 🥺=d, then \"body\" → bo d y. Then \"expose🥺\" → \"expose d\" → \"exposed\". That makes sense. \"expose d\" → \"exposed\". So \"exposed\" is a past tense verb. Let's check: \"case of an exposed me...\" Maybe. Let's check word 11: \"me🤔🐨🐮🐮ic\" → me t a [x][x] ic. If \"mechanical\"? m-e-c-h-a-n-i-c-a-l. No. If \"metallic\" → m-e-t-a-l-l-i-c. So \"me t a l l ic\" → \"metallic\". So if 🐮=l, then \"metallic\" would be me t a l l ic. That works. So \"me🤔🐨🐮🐮ic\" → me t a l l ic → \"metallic\". So 🐮=l. Then word 15: 🐮🐨🐶ge🐶 → l a r ge r → \"larger\". \"larger\" is l-a-r-g-e-r. That fits! So 🐮=l, 🐶=r. Then \"l a r ge r\" → \"larger\". Perfect.\n\nWord 16: 🥺i👻👻e🐶en🤔i🐨🤔e🥺 → d i f f e r en t i a t e d. Let's parse that. If 🥺=d, 👻=f, 🐶=r, 🤔=t, 🐨=a:\n\nd i f f e r en t i a t e d → \"differentiated\". Let's check:\n\n🥺=d, i, 👻=f, 👻=f, e, 🐶=r, en, 🤔=t, i, 🐨=a, 🤔=t, e, 🥺=d → d i f f e r en t i a t e d → \"differentiated\". That's a valid word! Wow, that fits.\n\nWord 17: p🐨🐶en🤔 → p a r en t → \"parent\". \"parent\" is p-a-r-e-n-t. So \"p a r en t\" → \"parent\". Perfect.\n\nWord 18: bo🥺y → bo d y → \"body\". That's correct.\n\nLet's put it all together with these guesses:\n\n- 🐨=a (given)\n- 🤔=t (from \"to be\")\n- 🐶=r (from \"appears\" → a-p-p-e-a-r-s)\n- 👻=f (from \"of\" → o-f)\n- 🥺=d (from \"exposed\" and \"body\")\n- 🐮=l (from \"metallic\" → me-t-a-l-l-ic and \"larger\" → l-a-r-g-e-r)\n\nLet's verify each part with these mappings:\n\nEncoded Sentence with substitutions:\n\npsyche (unchanged) \n🐨ppe🐨🐶s → a p p e a r s → \"appears\"\n🤔o → t o → \"to\"\nbe → \"be\"\n🐨 → a → \"a\"\ngenuine → \"genuine\"\nc🐨se → c a s e → \"case\" (since \"c🐨se\" is c-a-s-e; s and e are letters, not emojis)\no👻 → o f → \"of\"\n🐨n → a n → \"an\"\nexpose🥺 → expose d → \"exposed\"\nme🤔🐨🐮🐮ic → me t a l l ic → \"metallic\"\nco🐶e → co r e → \"core\"\n👻🐶om → f r om → \"from\"\n🐨 → a → \"a\"\n🐮🐨🐶ge🐶 → l a r ge r → \"larger\"\n🥺i👻👻e🐶en🤔i🐨🤔e🥺 → d i f f e r en t i a t e d → \"differentiated\"\np🐨🐶en🤔 → p a r en t → \"parent\"\nbo🥺y → bo d y → \"body\".\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence becomes:\n\n\"psyche appears to be a genuine case of an exposed me metallic core from a larger differentiated parent body.\"\n\nWait, let's check the flow:\n\n\"psyche appears to be a genuine case of an exposed metallic core from a larger differentiated parent body.\"\n\nThat makes sense. Let's check each substitution again:\n\n- 🐨=a ✔️ (given)\n- 🤔=t ✔️ (to)\n- 🐶=r ✔️ (appears: a-p-p-e-a-r-s)\n- 👻=f ✔️ (of: o-f)\n- 🥺=d ✔️ (exposed: expose-d, body: bo-d-y)\n- 🐮=l ✔️ (metallic: me-t-a-l-l-ic, larger: l-a-r-g-e-r)\n\nAll these emojis map to unique letters, which is required. Let's list all the emojis present in the encoded sentence and check if we have mappings for all:\n\nEmojis in the sentence: 🐨, 🐶, 🤔, 👻, 🥺, 🐮.\n\nWe have mappings for all:\n\n- 🐨=a (given)\n- 🐶=r\n- 🤔=t\n- 👻=f\n- 🥺=d\n- 🐮=l\n\nLet's confirm each emoji is mapped to a unique letter: a, r, t, f, d, l. All unique. Looks good.\n\nTo solve the crypto word game, we start by using the given hint that 🐨=a. We then analyze the encoded sentence to determine the mappings of other emojis by looking for common words and contextual clues. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **🐨=a** (given hint).  \n2. **🤔=t**: The phrase \"🤔o be\" is likely \"to be,\" so 🤔 corresponds to 't'.  \n3. **🐶=r**: The word \"🐨ppe🐨🐶s\" becomes \"a p p e a [🐶] s\". The most fitting word here is \"appears\" (a-p-p-e-a-r-s), so 🐶=r.  \n4. **👻=f**: The phrase \"o👻\" is likely \"of\" (o-f), so 👻=f.  \n5. **🥺=d**: The word \"bo🥺y\" is likely \"body\" (b-o-d-y), so 🥺=d. Additionally, \"expose🥺\" becomes \"exposed\" (expose-d), confirming 🥺=d.  \n6. **🐮=l**: The word \"me🤔🐨🐮🐮ic\" becomes \"me t a [🐮][🐮] ic\". The most fitting word here is \"metallic\" (m-e-t-a-l-l-i-c), so 🐮=l.  \n\nThese mappings are consistent with the context and form a coherent sentence.  \n\nAnswer: 🐨=a,🐶=r,🤔=t,👻=f,🥺=d,🐮=l"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The encoded sentence is given, and the hint is that 🤓=a. First, I need to replace all 🤓 with 'a' and then look for patterns to figure out other emojis.\n\nLet's start by substituting 🤓 with 'a' in the encoded sentence. Let's write out the sentence with that substitution:\n\nOriginal encoded sentence:\n💩🥶e h🤓🤑f c💩🥶t😎🥶ue🐷 t💩 r🤓ce 🥶💩rthw🤓r🐷, 🤓ffect😎🥶g the ce🥶tr🤓🤑 u🥶😎te🐷 🙄t🤓te🙄 🤓🤑💩🥶g 😎t🙄 😍🤓th, 🤓🥶🐷 w🤓🙄 🤑🤓🙄t 🐷😎🙄t😎🥶gu😎🙄h🤓🤗🤑e 😎🥶 the e🤓🙄ter🥶 gre🤓t 🤑🤓ke🙄 reg😎💩🥶 💩🥶 🤓ugu🙄t 31.\n\nAfter substituting 🤓=a:\n💩🥶e h a 🤑f c 💩🥶t 😎🥶ue 🐷 t 💩 r a ce 🥶💩rthw a r 🐷, a ffect 😎🥶g the ce 🥶tr a 🤑 u 🥶😎te 🐷 🙄t a te 🙄 a 🤑💩🥶g 😎t 🙄 😍a th, a 🥶🐷 w a 🙄 🤑a 🙄t 🐷😎🙄t 😎🥶gu 😎🙄h a 🤗🤑e 😎🥶 the e a 🙄ter 🥶 gre a t 🤑a ke 🙄 reg 😎💩🥶 💩🥶 a ugu 🙄t 31.\n\nLet's break this down into parts. Let's look for common words. The word \"the\" is in the sentence, so \"the\" is a common word. Let's check where \"the\" appears. The sentence has \"the ce🥶tr a 🤑 u 🥶😎te 🐷\" — so \"the\" is there. So \"the\" is already correct.\n\nLooking at \"a ffect 😎🥶g\" — \"affect\" is a word. So \"a ffect\" would be \"affect\", which fits if the emoji between a and ffect is part of the word. Wait, \"🤓ffect\" becomes \"affect\", which makes sense. So \"🤓ffect\" = \"affect\", which confirms that 🤓=a because \"a\" + \"ffect\" is \"affect\". That's a good check.\n\nNext, \"the ce🥶tr a 🤑\" — \"the center a...\" Maybe \"center\" is part of it. \"ce🥶tr a 🤑\" — \"center a...\" So \"ce\" + [🥶] + \"tr a\" — \"center\" would be \"ce\" + \"n\" + \"ter\". So maybe 🥶=n? Let's check: \"ce\" + n + \"tr a\" would be \"center a\". That could be \"center a...\" So \"ce🥶tr\" = \"center\". So if 🥶=n, then \"ce🥶tr\" becomes \"center\". Let's tentatively say 🥶=n.\n\nLet's try that. Substitute 🥶=n:\n\nNow, the sentence parts:\n\n💩n e h a 🤑f c 💩n t 😎n ue 🐷 t 💩 r a ce n 💩 rthw a r 🐷, a ffect 😎n g the ce n tr a 🤑 u n 😎te 🐷 🙄t a te 🙄 a 🤑💩n g 😎t 🙄 😍a th, a n 🐷 w a 🙄 🤑a 🙄t 🐷😎🙄t 😎n gu 😎🙄h a 🤗🤑e 😎n the e a 🙄ter n gre a t 🤑a ke 🙄 reg 😎💩n 💩n a ugu 🙄t 31.\n\nLooking at \"r a ce\" — \"race\" is a word. So \"r a ce\" = \"race\". That's correct.\n\n\"n 💩 rthw a r\" — \"n [💩] rthw a r\". Maybe \"northwar\" — \"northwar\" could be part of \"northward\". So \"northwar\" — \"n o rthwar\". So if 💩=o, then \"n o rthw a r\" becomes \"northwar\" (northward). Let's check that. Let's try 💩=o.\n\nSubstituting 💩=o:\n\nNow the sentence parts:\n\no n e h a 🤑f c o n t 😎n ue 🐷 t o r a ce n o rthw a r 🐷, a ffect 😎n g the ce n tr a 🤑 u n 😎te 🐷 🙄t a te 🙄 a 🤑o n g 😎t 🙄 😍a th, a n 🐷 w a 🙄 🤑a 🙄t 🐷😎🙄t 😎n gu 😎🙄h a 🤗🤑e 😎n the e a 🙄ter n gre a t 🤑a ke 🙄 reg 😎o n o n a ugu 🙄t 31.\n\nNow \"o n e\" — \"one\" is a word. That works. So \"💩🥶e\" = \"one\". That's a good fit.\n\n\"h a 🤑f\" — \"ha [🤑]f\". Maybe \"half\"? \"ha l f\" — \"half\". So if 🤑=l, then \"h a 🤑f\" becomes \"half\". Let's check that. 🤑=l.\n\nSubstituting 🤑=l:\n\nNow:\n\no n e h a l f c o n t 😎n ue 🐷 t o r a ce n o rthw a r 🐷, a ffect 😎n g the ce n tr a l u n 😎te 🐷 🙄t a te 🙄 a l o n g 😎t 🙄 😍a th, a n 🐷 w a 🙄 l a 🙄t 🐷😎🙄t 😎n gu 😎🙄h a 🤗l e 😎n the e a 🙄ter n gre a t l a ke 🙄 reg 😎o n o n a ugu 🙄t 31.\n\nLooking at \"c o n t\" — \"cont\" could be part of \"content\" or \"continue\". Let's see the next part: \"😎n ue\" — if 😎=t, then \"t n ue\" — \"tinue\". So \"c o n t t n ue\" — \"continue\". That's possible. Let's try 😎=t.\n\nSubstituting 😎=t:\n\nNow:\n\no n e h a l f c o n t t n ue 🐷 t o r a ce n o rthw a r 🐷, a ffect t n g the ce n tr a l u n t e 🐷 🙄t a te 🙄 a l o n g t t 🙄 😍a th, a n 🐷 w a 🙄 l a 🙄t 🐷t 🙄t t n gu t 🙄h a 🤗l e t n the e a 🙄ter n gre a t l a ke 🙄 reg t o n o n a ugu 🙄t 31.\n\nLooking at \"c o n t t n ue\" — \"continue\" (cont + inue? Wait, \"continue\" is c-o-n-t-i-n-u-e. Oh, maybe I made a mistake. Let's check again. The original after substituting 🤓=a and 🥶=n and 💩=o, and 🤑=l: \"c💩🥶t😎🥶ue\" becomes \"c o n t [😎] n ue\". So \"cont [😎] nue\". If \"continue\" is the word, then \"cont i nue\". So [😎] would be 'i'. Let's try 😎=i.\n\nLet's backtrack. If 😎=i:\n\nSo \"c o n t i n ue\" — \"continue\". That's correct. Let's try 😎=i.\n\nSo substituting 😎=i:\n\no n e h a l f c o n t i n ue 🐷 t o r a ce n o rthw a r 🐷, a ffect i n g the ce n tr a l u n i e 🐷 🙄t a te 🙄 a l o n g i t 🙄 😍a th, a n 🐷 w a 🙄 l a 🙄t 🐷i 🙄t i n gu i 🙄h a 🤗l e i n the e a 🙄ter n gre a t l a ke 🙄 reg i o n o n a ugu 🙄t 31.\n\n\"continue\" fits. Good. \"affecting\" — \"a ffect i n g\" — \"affecting\". Perfect. \"the ce n tr a l\" — \"the central\" (central). \"ce n tr a l\" = \"central\". That works. \"u n i e\" — \"unie\"? Maybe \"unite\" if the next part is \"te\". Let's look at \"u🥶😎te\" — \"u n i te\" — \"unite\". Oh! \"u🥶😎te\" becomes \"unite\" if 🥶=n, 😎=i. Because \"u\" + n + i + \"te\" = \"unite\". That's correct. So \"u🥶😎te\" = \"unite\". So that's a confirmation.\n\nSo \"u n i te\" — \"unite\". So that part makes sense.\n\nNext, \"a l o n g i t 🙄\" — \"along it [🙄]\". Maybe \"along it s\" — so 🙄=s. Let's try 🙄=s.\n\nSubstituting 🙄=s:\n\no n e h a l f c o n t i n ue 🐷 t o r a ce n o rthw a r 🐷, a ffect i n g the ce n tr a l u n i te 🐷 s t a te s a l o n g i t s 😍a th, a n 🐷 w a s l a s t 🐷i s t i n gu i s h a 🤗l e i n the e a s ter n gre a t l a ke s reg i o n o n a ugu s t 31.\n\nWow, that's coming together. Let's check each part:\n\n\"o n e\" = \"one\" (correct).\n\n\"h a l f\" = \"half\" (correct).\n\n\"c o n t i n ue 🐷\" — \"continue [🐷]\". Maybe \"continue d\"? So 🐷=d. Let's try 🐷=d.\n\nSubstituting 🐷=d:\n\no n e h a l f c o n t i n ue d t o r a ce n o rthw a r d, a ffect i n g the ce n tr a l u n i te d s t a te s a l o n g i t s 😍a th, a n d w a s l a s t d i s t i n gu i s h a 🤗l e i n the e a s ter n gre a t l a ke s reg i o n o n a ugu s t 31.\n\n\"continue d\" — \"continued\" (correct). \"northw a r d\" — \"northward\" (correct). \"the central united\" — \"the central united\" (United? Like United States). \"united states\" — \"united states\" (so \"u n i te d s t a te s\" — \"united states\". That fits! So \"u n i te 🐷\" = \"united\" (since 🐷=d). Then \"s t a te s\" — \"states\". So that's \"the central united states\".\n\n\"along its [😍]ath\" — \"along its path\". So \"😍a th\" = \"path\". So \"p a th\" — \"path\". So 😍=p.\n\nSubstituting 😍=p:\n\no n e h a l f c o n t i n ue d t o r a ce n o rthw a r d, a ffect i n g the ce n tr a l u n i te d s t a te s a l o n g i t s p a th, a n d w a s l a s t d i s t i n gu i s h a 🤗l e i n the e a s ter n gre a t l a ke s reg i o n o n a ugu s t 31.\n\n\"along its path\" — correct. \n\n\"a n d\" — \"and\" (so \"a n 🐷\" = \"and\" since 🐷=d: \"a n d\" = \"and\"). Correct.\n\n\"w a s l a s t\" — \"was last\" (correct). \n\n\"d i s t i n gu i s h a [🤗]l e\" — \"distinguish a [🤗]le\". The word is \"distinguishable\". So \"distinguish a ble\" — \"distinguishable\". So [🤗]le = \"ble\". So 🤗=b.\n\nSubstituting 🤗=b:\n\no n e h a l f c o n t i n ue d t o r a ce n o rthw a r d, a ffect i n g the ce n tr a l u n i te d s t a te s a l o n g i t s p a th, a n d w a s l a s t d i s t i n gu i s h a b l e i n the e a s ter n gre a t l a ke s reg i o n o n a ugu s t 31.\n\nYes! \"distinguishable\" — \"distinguish able\". Perfect. \n\nNow check the rest: \"in the eastern great lakes region on august 31.\" \n\n\"e a s ter n\" — \"eastern\" (correct). \"gre a t\" — \"great\" (correct). \"l a ke s\" — \"lakes\" (correct). \"reg i o n\" — \"region\" (correct). \"a ugu s t\" — \"august\" (correct). \n\nLet's check all parts again to confirm:\n\nOriginal encoded sentence with substitutions:\n\n💩=o, 🥶=n, 🤓=a, 🤑=l, 😎=i, 🙄=s, 🐷=d, 😍=p, 🤗=b.\n\nLet's verify each emoji:\n\n- 💩=o: \"💩🥶e\" = one (o + n + e = one) ✔️\n- 🥶=n: \"c💩🥶t\" = cont (c + o + n + t = cont) ✔️; \"ce🥶tr\" = center (c + e + n + t + r = center, but in the sentence it's \"ce🥶tr a 🤑\" which becomes \"central\" (ce + n + tr + a + l = central) ✔️\n- 🤓=a (given) ✔️\n- 🤑=l: \"h🤓🤑f\" = half (h + a + l + f = half) ✔️\n- 😎=i: \"ffect😎🥶g\" = affecting (a + ffect + i + n + g = affecting) ✔️; \"u🥶😎te\" = unite (u + n + i + te = unite) ✔️\n- 🙄=s: \"🙄t🤓te🙄\" = states (s + t + a + te + s = states) ✔️\n- 🐷=d: \"c💩🥶t😎🥶ue🐷\" = continued (c + o + n + t + i + n + ue + d = continued) ✔️; \"t💩 r🤓ce 🥶💩rthw🤓r🐷\" = to race northward (t + o + r + a + ce + n + o + rthw + a + r + d = to race northward) ✔️\n- 😍=p: \"😍🤓th\" = path (p + a + th = path) ✔️\n- 🤗=b: \"gu😎🙄h🤓🤗🤑e\" = distinguish (gu + i + s + h + a + b + l + e = distinguish) ✔️\n\nAll substitutions fit the sentence.

The encoded sentence is: \"the m🥶st d🥶m🐷🐼🐯🐼t m🐯🤫es 🤓🐯🐼 🤓🥶🤫🤫e🤓t 🐯s m🐯🐼🐦 🐯s 15 - 20 🐮em🐯🤫es t🥶 m🐯te 😇🐷th.\" \n\nFirst, the hint says 🐯=a. Let's replace all 🐯 with a. Let's rewrite the sentence with that substitution:\n\nOriginal: the m🥶st d🥶m🐷🐼🐯🐼t m🐯🤫es 🤓🐯🐼 🤓🥶🤫🤫e🤓t 🐯s m🐯🐼🐦 🐯s 15 - 20 🐮em🐯🤫es t🥶 m🐯te 😇🐷th.\n\nAfter 🐯=a: the m🥶st d🥶m🐷🐼a🐼t ma🤫es 🤓a🐼 🤓🥶🤫🤫e🤓t as ma🐼🐦 as 15 - 20 🐮ema🤫es t🥶 mate 😇🐷th.\n\nNow, let's look for common words. The sentence starts with \"the\", which is a common word. Let's look at \"the m🥶st\" — \"the m...st\" — probably \"the most\" or \"the mast\" or \"the mist\". \"Most\" is a common word, so maybe m🥶st is \"most\". That would mean 🥶=o. Let's check that. If 🥶=o, then m🥶st becomes most. Let's substitute 🥶=o:\n\nNow: the most d🥶m🐷🐼a🐼t ma🤫es 🤓a🐼 🤓🥶🤫🤫e🤓t as ma🐼🐦 as 15 - 20 🐮ema🤫es t🥶 mate 😇🐷th.\n\nSo d🥶m... becomes d o m... So \"dom...\" Maybe \"domestic\" or \"dominant\"? Let's look at the next part: \"d🥶m🐷🐼a🐼t\" — \"dom...a...t\". Let's break it down: \"d o m [🐷][🐼] a [🐼] t\". Let's see. The word might be \"domesticat\" but that's not right. Alternatively, \"dominated\" — let's check. \"Dominated\" is d-o-m-i-n-a-t-e-d. But here, the structure is d o m [x][y] a [y] t. Let's count letters: \"d o m [x][y] a [y] t\" — that's 8 letters. Let's see: d (1), o (2), m (3), x (4), y (5), a (6), y (7), t (8). So the 4th letter is x, 5th y, 7th y. Maybe \"dominated\" is 9 letters (d-o-m-i-n-a-t-e-d), which is longer. Alternatively, \"domestic\" is 8 letters: d-o-m-e-s-t-i-c. No, 8 letters: d(1), o(2), m(3), e(4), s(5), t(6), i(7), c(8). Doesn't fit. Maybe \"domiciled\"? d-o-m-i-c-i-l-e-d (9 letters). Not matching. Let's look elsewhere.\n\nNext, \"ma🤫es\" — \"ma...es\". \"Masses\"? m-a-s-s-e-s. So ma🤫es would be masses if 🤫=s. Let's check that. If 🤫=s, then ma🤫es is masses. Let's try that substitution. Then:\n\nNow: the most d o m [🐷][🐼] a [🐼] t ma sses 🤓a🐼 🤓o s s e 🤓t as ma [🐼][🐦] as 15 - 20 [🐮] e m a sses t o mate 😇[🐷]th.\n\nLet's check \"ma sses\" — \"masses\" which makes sense. Next, \"🤓a🐼\" — maybe \"cat\" (c-a-t), but \"🤓a🐼\" is three letters. If 🤓=c, then \"c a [🐼]\" — \"cat\" if 🐼=t. Let's try 🐼=t. Then \"🤓a🐼\" becomes c a t. That's \"cat\". Let's check that. So 🐼=t. Let's substitute:\n\nNow: the most d o m [🐷] t a t t ma sses c a t c o s s e c t as ma t [🐦] as 15 - 20 [🐮] e m a sses t o mate 😇[🐷]th.\n\nLet's check \"d o m [🐷] t a t t\" — \"dom...tatt\". Maybe \"dominated\" — d-o-m-i-n-a-t-e-d. But the structure here is d-o-m-[x]-t-a-t-t. Let's count letters: d(1), o(2), m(3), x(4), t(5), a(6), t(7), t(8). That's 8 letters. \"Dominate\" is d-o-m-i-n-a-t-e (8 letters). Let's check: d(1), o(2), m(3), i(4), n(5), a(6), t(7), e(8). No, that's 8 letters. Our current structure is d-o-m-x-t-a-t-t (8 letters). Maybe \"domesticate\"? No. Let's check the next part: \"c o s s e c t\" — \"coss...ect\". \"Connect\"? c-o-n-n-e-c-t. But here it's c-o-s-s-e-c-t. \"Cosset\" is c-o-s-s-e-t (6 letters), but here it's 7 letters (c o s s e c t). Maybe \"cosset\" plus a letter? Not sure. Let's look at \"as ma t [🐦]\" — \"as mat [🐦]\". \"Mat\" plus a letter: \"mats\", \"mate\", \"matz\". If [🐦] is s, then \"mat s\" — \"mats\". So \"as mat s\" — \"as mats\". Let's say 🐦=s. Then:\n\nNow: the most d o m [🐷] t a t t ma sses c a t c o s s e c t as ma t s as 15 - 20 [🐮] e m a sses t o mate 😇[🐷]th.\n\nNext, \"t o mate\" — \"to mate\" which makes sense. \"t o mate\" is \"to mate\". Then \"😇[🐷]th\" — \"..th\". \"With\" is w-i-t-h. So if [🐷] is i, then \"😇i th\" — \"with\" if 😇=w. Let's try that. So [🐷]=i and 😇=w. Let's substitute:\n\nNow: the most d o m i t a t t ma sses c a t c o s s e c t as ma t s as 15 - 20 [🐮] e m a sses t o mate w i th.\n\nSo \"d o m i t a t t\" — \"domitatt\" — that's not a word. Maybe I made a mistake. Let's check \"d🥶m🐷🐼a🐼t\" again. With 🥶=o, 🐼=t, 🐷=i, that becomes \"domitatt\". Hmm. Maybe \"dominated\" — but the structure would need to be d o m i n a t e d. Let's see. The original part is \"d🥶m🐷🐼🐯🐼t\" — which with 🐯=a, that's \"d o m [🐷][🐼] a [🐼] t\". So letters 4: 🐷, 5: 🐼, 6: a, 7: 🐼, 8: t. So positions 4-8: [🐷][🐼]a[🐼]t. If \"dominated\" is d o m i n a t e d, then 4: i, 5: n, 6: a, 7: t, 8: e, 9: d. Doesn't match. Alternatively, \"domesticate\" is longer. Maybe \"dismantle\"? d i s m a n t l e. No, the first letters are d o m. Let's check another part. \"🤓🥶🤫🤫e🤓t\" — with 🥶=o, 🤫=s, 🤓=c, that's \"c o s s e c t\". \"Cosset\" is c o s s e t (6 letters), but here it's \"cossect\" (7 letters). \"Cossect\" isn't a word. Maybe \"connect\"? c o n n e c t. So if 🤫=n instead of s. Let's backtrack. If \"ma🤫es\" is \"mates\", then 🤫=t. But \"mates\" is m a t e s. Then \"ma🤫es\" would be m a t e s, so 🤫=e. Wait, \"ma🤫es\" — m a [x] e s. So [x] is the third letter. \"Masses\" (m a s s e s) would be m a s s e s, so [x] is s (third letter s, fourth s). So \"ma s s e s\" — that's 6 letters. So \"ma🤫es\" has 6 letters (m,a,🤫,e,s). Wait, let's count the letters in \"ma🤫es\". The original is \"m🐯🤫es\" — m a 🤫 e s. So 5 letters: m,a,🤫,e,s. So 5 letters. \"Masses\" is 6 letters (m,a,s,s,e,s). So that's 6 letters. So \"ma🤫es\" is 5 letters. So m a [x] e s. What 5-letter words fit? \"Males\" (m,a,l,e,s) — so x=l. \"Mares\" (m,a,r,e,s) — x=r. \"Mates\" (m,a,t,e,s) — x=t. \"Males\" could be possible. Let's think of \"ma🤫es\" as \"mates\" (x=t). Then 🤫=t. Let's try that. Then:\n\nAfter 🐯=a, 🤫=t: \"ma t es\" — \"mates\".\n\nThen the sentence becomes: the m🥶st d🥶m🐷🐼a🐼t ma tes 🤓a🐼 🤓🥶t t e 🤓t as ma 🐼🐦 as 15 - 20 🐮ema tes t🥶 mate 😇🐷th.\n\nIf \"m🥶st\" is \"most\" (so 🥶=o), then:\n\nthe most d o m 🐷🐼a🐼t ma tes 🤓a🐼 🤓o t t e 🤓t as ma 🐼🐦 as 15 - 20 🐮ema tes t o mate 😇🐷th.\n\nNow, \"d o m 🐷🐼a🐼t\" — let's see. \"Dom...a...t\". Maybe \"domesticate\" (d-o-m-e-s-t-i-c-a-t-e) but that's longer. Alternatively, \"dominated\" (d-o-m-i-n-a-t-e-d). Let's check \"dominated\": d(1), o(2), m(3), i(4), n(5), a(6), t(7), e(8), d(9). The structure here is d o m [x][y] a [y] t. So 4: x, 5: y, 6: a, 7: y, 8: t. So 4-8: x y a y t. For \"dominated\", 4-8 would be i n a t e (positions 4-8: i(4),n(5),a(6),t(7),e(8)). So that's i n a t e. So y would be n (position 5) and y (position 7) would need to be n, but position 7 is y, so if y=n, then 7: n. So 4: x, 5: n, 6:a,7:n,8:t. So x is 4th letter. So \"dom x n a n t\". Maybe \"dominant\"? d-o-m-i-n-a-n-t. Let's check \"dominant\": d(1), o(2), m(3), i(4), n(5), a(6), n(7), t(8). Yes! That's 8 letters. \"Dominant\" is d-o-m-i-n-a-n-t. So that fits the structure d o m [i] [n] a [n] t. So if 🐷=i and 🐼=n, then \"d o m i n a n t\" — \"dominant\". That works! Let's try that. So 🐷=i, 🐼=n. Let's substitute:\n\nNow, \"d o m i n a n t\" — \"dominant\". That's correct. So 🐷=i, 🐼=n.\n\nThen, \"ma tes\" — \"mates\" (since 🤫=t, m a t e s).\n\nNext, \"🤓a🐼\" — \"🤓a n\". Let's see, \"can\" (c-a-n). So if 🤓=c, then \"c a n\" — \"can\". That's a good fit. So 🤓=c.\n\nSo \"🤓a🐼\" becomes \"can\".\n\nNext, \"🤓🥶t t e 🤓t\" — \"c o t t e c t\". \"Cott...\" \"Cottage\" is c-o-t-t-a-g-e. But here, \"c o t t e c t\" — 7 letters. \"Cott\" plus \"ect\"? Maybe \"connect\" — but \"connect\" is c-o-n-n-e-c-t. Oh, but we have \"c o t t e c t\". Maybe \"cottage\" but that's 7 letters: c-o-t-t-a-g-e. No. Alternatively, \"cotter\" (c-o-t-t-e-r) but that's 6 letters. Let's check the context. The sentence so far: \"the most dominant mates can [something] as ma [n][🐦] as 15-20 [🐮]emates to mate with.\"\n\nWait, \"🐯s m🐯🐼🐦\" — \"as ma n 🐦\". \"As man...\" \"As man s\" (if 🐦=s) — \"as mans\". \"As man y\" — \"as many\". Let's think: \"as many as 15-20...\" That makes sense. So \"ma n y\" — \"many\". So if 🐦=y, then \"ma n y\" — \"many\". So 🐦=y. Let's substitute:\n\n\"as ma n y as 15 - 20 [🐮]ema tes t o mate 😇i th.\"\n\n\"i th\" — \"ith\". \"With\" is w-i-t-h. So \"😇i th\" — \"with\" if 😇=w. So 😇=w.\n\nThen \"t o mate\" — \"to mate\".\n\nPutting it all together: \"the most dominant mates can [c o t t e c t] as many as 15 - 20 [🐮]emates to mate with.\"\n\nNow, \"🤓🥶🤫🤫e🤓t\" — \"c o t t e c t\" — \"connect\"? No, but \"c o t t e c t\" — maybe \"correct\"? c-o-r-r-e-c-t. No. Alternatively, \"contact\" — c-o-n-t-a-c-t. No. Let's check the letters again. \"🤓🥶🤫🤫e🤓t\" — c o t t e c t. \"Cottage\" is c-o-t-t-a-g-e. Not matching. Let's look at \"🐮em🐯🤫es\" — \"🐮e m a t es\" — \"Xemates\". \"Premates\"? \"Premates\" — p-r-e-m-a-t-e-s. If 🐮=p, then \"p e m a t e s\" — \"premates\". That could work. So 🐮=p.\n\nNow, the sentence becomes: \"the most dominant mates can c o t t e c t as many as 15 - 20 premates to mate with.\"\n\n\"c o t t e c t\" — \"cottect\" isn't a word. Maybe I made a mistake with 🤫. Let's go back. Earlier, we assumed 🤫=t because \"ma🤫es\" became \"mates\". But let's check \"ma🤫es\" again. \"m🐯🤫es\" — m a [x] e s. 5 letters: m,a,x,e,s. \"Masses\" is m,a,s,s,e,s (6 letters). \"Mares\" is m,a,r,e,s (5 letters). \"Mares\" would make \"mares\", so x=r. Let's try 🤫=r. Then \"ma r e s\" — \"mares\". Let's try that. Then:\n\n\"the m🥶st d🥶m🐷🐼a🐼t ma res 🤓a🐼 🤓🥶r r e 🤓t as ma 🐼🐦 as 15 - 20 🐮ema res t🥶 mate 😇🐷th.\"\n\nIf \"m🥶st\" is \"most\" (🥶=o), then:\n\n\"the most d o m 🐷🐼a🐼t ma res 🤓a🐼 🤓o r r e 🤓t as ma 🐼🐦 as 15 - 20 🐮ema res t o mate 😇🐷th.\"\n\n\"d o m 🐷🐼a🐼t\" — let's try \"dominant\" again. If 🐷=i, 🐼=n, then \"d o m i n a n t\" — \"dominant\". So that's correct. Then:\n\n\"the most dominant ma res 🤓a n 🤓o r r e 🤓t as ma n 🐦 as 15 - 20 🐮ema res t o mate 😇i th.\"\n\n\"ma res\" — \"mares\" (female horses). \"🤓a n\" — \"can\" (if 🤓=c). So \"can\".\n\n\"🤓o r r e 🤓t\" — \"c o r r e c t\" — \"correct\"! Oh! That works. \"correct\" is c-o-r-r-e-c-t. So \"c o r r e c t\" — that's exactly \"correct\". So 🤫=r. Because \"🤫🤫\" would be \"r r\" (since \"🤓🥶🤫🤫e🤓t\" is c o r r e c t). So yes! 🤫=r.\n\nSo 🤫=r. Then \"ma🤫es\" is \"mares\" (m a r e s). That works. Let's recheck:\n\n\"ma🤫es\" = m a r e s → 🤫=r.\n\nThen \"🤓🥶🤫🤫e🤓t\" = c o r r e c t → correct. That's perfect.\n\nSo let's update all substitutions:\n\n🐯=a (given), 🥶=o (from \"most\"), 🐷=i (from \"dominant\"), 🐼=n (from \"dominant\"), 🤫=r (from \"correct\"), 🤓=c (from \"can\" and \"correct\"), 🐦=y (from \"many\"), 🐮=p (from \"premates\"), 😇=w (from \"with\").\n\nLet's substitute all into the original sentence:\n\nOriginal: the m🥶st d🥶m🐷🐼🐯🐼t m🐯🤫es 🤓🐯🐼 🤓🥶🤫🤫e🤓t 🐯s m🐯🐼🐦 🐯s 15 - 20 🐮em🐯🤫es t🥶 m🐯te 😇🐷th.\n\nSubstituting:\n\nthe m o st d o m i n a n t m a r es c a n c o r r e c t a s m a n y a s 15 - 20 p em a r es t o m a te w i th.\n\nNow, let's check each part:\n\n- m🥶st → most (m o st) ✔️\n- d🥶m🐷🐼🐯🐼t → d o m i n a n t (dominant) ✔️\n- m🐯🤫es → m a r es (mares) ✔️\n- 🤓🐯🐼 → c a n (can) ✔️\n- 🤓🥶🤫🤫e🤓t → c o r r e c t (correct) ✔️\n- 🐯s → a s (as) ✔️\n- m🐯🐼🐦 → m a n y (many) ✔️\n- 🐮em🐯🤫es → p em a r es (premates) ✔️ (though \"premates\" is a less common word, but possible)\n- t🥶 → t o (to) ✔️\n- m🐯te → m a te (mate) ✔️\n- 😇🐷th → w i th (with) ✔️\n\nPutting it all together, the decoded sentence is: \"the most dominant mares can correct as many as 15 - 20 premates to mate with.\" That makes sense. \n\nSo the emojis and their letters are:\n\n🥶=o, 🐷=i, 🐼=n, 🐯=a (given), 🤫=r, 🤓=c, 🐦=y, 🐮=p, 😇=w.\n\n🥶=o,🐷=i,🐼=n,🐯=a,🤫=r,🤓=c,🐦=y,🐮=p,😇=w\nAnswer: 🥶=o,🐷=i,🐼=n,🐯=a,🤫=r,🤓=c,🐦=y,🐮=p,😇=w","Okay, let's try to figure out the current puzzle. First, let's list out all the emojis and their known or unknown status based on the history. \n\nFrom the first attempt's feedback, we know that:\n- 🥶=o (correct)\n- 🐷=i (correct)\n- 🐼=n (correct)\n- 🐯=a (correct, as given in the hint)\n- 🤫 was guessed as 'r' but incorrect, so it's wrong. Need to find another letter.\n- 🤓=c (correct)\n- 🐦=y (correct)\n- 🐮 was guessed as 'p' but incorrect.\n- 😇=w (correct)\n\nSo the known mappings are: 🥶=o, 🐷=i, 🐼=n, 🐯=a, 🤓=c, 🐦=y, 😇=w.\n\nNow, let's substitute these into the encoded sentence to see what we get. Let's go step by step.\n\nEncoded Sentence: \"the m🥶st d🥶m🐷🐼🐯🐼t m🐯🤫es 🤓🐯🐼 🤓🥶🤫🤫e🤓t 🐯s m🐯🐼🐦 🐯s 15 - 20 🐮em🐯🤫es t🥶 m🐯te 😇🐷th.\"\n\nSubstituting known emojis:\n- 🥶=o → m🥶st → most; d🥶m → dom\n- 🐷=i → m🐷 → mi; 🐷th → ith (maybe 'with'? Wait, 😇=w, so 😇🐷th → w ith → 'with'? That makes sense. So 😇=w, 🐷=i, so 'with' would be w i th → yes, that works. So that part checks out.\n- 🐼=n → 🐼t → nt; m🐯🐼🐦 → m a n y (since 🐯=a, 🐼=n, 🐦=y → many)\n- 🐯=a → m🐯 → ma; 🐯s → as; t🥶 m🐯te → to mate (t🥶 is to, m🐯te is mate)\n- 🤓=c → 🤓🐯🐼 → c a n (can); 🤓🥶🤫🤫e🤓t → c o [🤫][🤫] e c t (co??ect, maybe 'correct'? If so, then 🤫 would be 'r'? Wait, but the first guess had 🤫=r as incorrect. Oh, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let's check again.\n\nLet's substitute each part:\n\nOriginal sentence with substitutions:\n\n\"the m(o)st d(o)m(i)(n)(a)(n)t m(a)🤫es (c)(a)(n) (c)(o)🤫🤫e(c)t (a)s m(a)(n)(y) (a)s 15 - 20 🐮em(a)🤫es t(o) m(a)te (w)(i)th.\"\n\nLet's parse this:\n\n- \"the most d o m i n a n t m a 🤫es\" → \"the most dominant ma[🤫]es\" → \"the most dominant [something]s\". \"Dominant\" is correct (dominant), so that part works. \"ma[🤫]es\" → \"ma\" + [🤫] + \"es\". Maybe \"males\"? If [🤫] is 'l', then \"males\". But let's check next parts.\n\nNext: \"(c)(a)(n)\" → \"can\". That's correct.\n\nThen: \"(c)(o)🤫🤫e(c)t\" → \"co[🤫][🤫]ect\". The word here could be \"correct\". \"Correct\" is c-o-r-r-e-c-t. So if this is \"correct\", then [🤫][🤫] would be 'rr'. So 🤫=r. But wait, in the first guess, the user guessed 🤫=r and the feedback was 'False'. Oh, that's a problem. So that's a contradiction. Let's check again. The first attempt's feedback says 🤫: False, so 🤫≠r. So maybe \"co[🤫][🤫]ect\" is another word. Let's think of other possibilities. Maybe \"connect\"? But that's c-o-n-n-e-c-t. Then [🤫] would be 'n', but 🐼 is already 'n'. So that's taken. \"Collect\"? c-o-l-l-e-c-t. Then [🤫] would be 'l'. So if 🤫=l, then \"coll\" → \"collect\". Let's check that. \"co\" + \"ll\" + \"ect\" → \"collect\". That could fit. Let's see the context. The sentence after \"can\" is \"collect\" what?\n\nNext part: \"(a)s m(a)(n)(y) (a)s\" → \"as many as\". That's correct (as many as).\n\nThen \"15 - 20 🐮em(a)🤫es\" → \"15-20 [🐮]em(a)[🤫]es\". Let's see. \"em(a)[🤫]es\" → \"em\" + \"a\" + [🤫] + \"es\". Maybe \"emails\"? em + a + i + ls? No. \"emails\" is e-m-a-i-l-s. Hmm. Alternatively, \"elements\"? em + a + l + ents? Not sure. Let's think of \"emails\": e-m-a-i-l-s. If [🤫] is 'i', but 🐷 is 'i' already. So that's taken. \"emails\" would be e-m-a-i-l-s. If \"emails\" is the word, then \"em(a)[🤫]es\" → \"ema\" + [🤫] + \"s\" → \"ema\" + \"il\" + \"s\"? Maybe not. Alternatively, \"emails\" would be \"emails\", so \"ema\" + \"ils\". Maybe. Alternatively, \"emails\" would be \"emails\", which is 6 letters. Let's check the length. \"em(a)[🤫]es\" → em + a + [🤫] + es. That's 2 (em) +1 (a) +1 (🤫) +2 (es) → 6 letters. \"emails\" is 6 letters. So \"ema\" + \"ils\" → \"emails\". So \"ils\" would be [🤫] + \"es\". So [🤫] would be 'i'? But 🐷=i. So no. Alternatively, \"emails\" would be e-m-a-i-l-s. So \"ema\" + \"ils\" → \"ema\" + \"ils\" = \"emails\". So \"ils\" would be \"i l s\". But \"es\" is the end, so \"emails\" would be \"em a i l s\" → \"ema\" + \"ils\". So \"ils\" is i-l-s. So \"emails\" → \"ema\" + \"ils\". So [🤫] would be 'l', and \"es\" is the end. So \"em(a)[🤫]es\" → \"ema\" + \"l\" + \"es\" → \"emales\"? That's 6 letters. \"emales\" (plural of emale, but that's not a word). Maybe \"examples\"? Let's see. \"examples\" is e-x-a-m-p-l-e-s. No, not matching. Alternatively, \"items\"? No, length is 5. Let's think again.\n\nThe next part: \"t(o) m(a)te\" → \"to mate\". That makes sense. Then \"w(i)th\" → \"with\". So that part is \"to mate with\".\n\nPutting it all together so far:\n\n\"the most dominant ma[🤫]es can co[🤫][🤫]ect as many as 15-20 [🐮]emails to mate with.\"\n\nWait, if \"co[🤫][🤫]ect\" is \"collect\", then [🤫] would be 'l', since \"collect\" is c-o-l-l-e-c-t. So \"co\" + \"ll\" + \"ect\" → \"collect\". Then \"ma[🤫]es\" would be \"males\" (ma + l + es). So \"ma\" + \"l\" + \"es\" → \"males\". That fits. So \"males\" (plural of male). So \"the most dominant males can collect as many as 15-20 [🐮]emails to mate with.\"\n\nThat makes sense. So \"emails\" → \"em a i l s\" but wait, \"emails\" is e-m-a-i-l-s. Let's check \"em(a)[🤫]es\" → \"em\" + \"a\" + [🤫] + \"es\". If [🤫] is 'i', then \"emails\" would be \"emails\", but 🐷=i. But [🤫] was guessed as 'r' (incorrect), so 'i' is taken. Alternatively, \"emails\" would be \"em a i l s\", so \"ema\" + \"ils\". So \"ils\" would be \"i l s\". But \"es\" is the end. So \"emails\" → \"ema\" + \"ils\". So \"ils\" is \"i l s\". So \"emails\" would be \"ema\" + \"ils\". Then \"ils\" is \"i l s\", so [🤫] is 'l', and \"es\" is \"s\". So \"em(a)[🤫]es\" → \"ema\" + \"l\" + \"es\" → \"emales\". But \"emales\" isn't a word. Maybe \"elements\"? Let's see: \"elements\" is e-l-e-m-e-n-t-s. No, not matching. Alternatively, \"emails\" is the target. Let's check if \"emails\" would fit. \"emails\" is 6 letters. \"em(a)[🤫]es\" → 2 (em) +1 (a) +1 (🤫) +2 (es) = 6 letters. So \"ema\" + [🤫] + \"es\". If [🤫] is 'i', then \"emails\" → \"emails\", but 🐷=i. So that's not possible. If [🤫] is 'l', then \"emalses\"? No. Alternatively, \"emails\" could be \"ema\" + \"ils\", which would be \"ema\" + \"ils\" → \"emails\". So \"ils\" is \"i l s\", so \"ils\" is 3 letters. But \"em(a)[🤫]es\" is 6 letters: em (2) + a (1) + [🤫] (1) + es (2) → 6. So [🤫] is 1 letter, so \"ils\" would require [🤫] to be 3 letters, which isn't possible. So perhaps I'm on the wrong track.\n\nLet's look at the part \"m🐯🤫es\" → m a [🤫] es. So \"ma[🤫]es\". Let's think of possible 5-letter words ending with 'es'. \"Males\" (ma l es). \"Mates\" (ma t es). \"Mares\" (ma r es). \"Majes\" (ma j es) but not a common word. \"Males\" is likely. So if \"ma[🤫]es\" is \"males\", then [🤫] is 'l'. Let's check if that works with the other part \"co[🤫][🤫]ect\" → \"co\" + \"ll\" + \"ect\" → \"collect\". So \"collect\" would require [🤫] to be 'l', which would make \"ma[🤫]es\" = \"males\" and \"co[🤫][🤫]ect\" = \"collect\". That fits. So \"the most dominant males can collect as many as 15-20 [🐮]emails to mate with.\"\n\nNow, \"emails\" would be \"em a i l s\". Let's check \"em🐯🤫es\" → em a [🤫] es. If [🤫] is 'l', then \"em a l es\" → \"emales\" (but not a word). Alternatively, \"emails\" is \"em a i l s\". So \"em a i l s\" → \"emails\". So \"em a i l s\" → \"emails\". So \"em🐯🤫es\" → em (e m) + a (🐯) + i (🐷) + l (🤫) + s (es). Wait, \"emails\" is e-m-a-i-l-s. So the encoded part is \"em🐯🤫es\" → \"em\" (e m) + \"a\" (🐯) + [🤫] + \"es\" (s). So \"em\" + \"a\" + [🤫] + \"s\" → \"ema[🤫]s\". So \"ema[🤫]s\" should be \"emails\". So [🤫] would be 'i l'? No, [🤫] is a single emoji, so a single letter. So \"ema\" + [🤫] + \"s\" → \"emails\" would require [🤫] to be 'il', which isn't possible. So perhaps \"emails\" is not the word. Let's think of \"emails\" as \"emails\", which is 6 letters. The encoded part is \"em🐯🤫es\" → \"em\" (2) + \"a\" (1) + [🤫] (1) + \"es\" (2) → 6 letters. So 2+1+1+2=6. So \"ema\" + [🤫] + \"s\". So \"ema[🤫]s\". What 6-letter words fit that? \"Emails\" (ema i ls → no). \"Emblems\" (too long). \"Embank\" (no). \"Embers\" (ema b ers → embers). So \"ema[🤫]s\" → \"embers\". So [🤫] would be 'b'. Then \"ma[🤫]es\" → \"ma b es\" → \"mabes\" (not a word). So that's not good.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's check the word \"🤓🥶🤫🤫e🤓t\" → \"c o [🤫][🤫] e c t\". Let's list possible 7-letter words starting with 'co', ending with 'ect'. The most common is \"correct\" (c-o-r-r-e-c-t). So that's 7 letters. \"correct\" → c o r r e c t. So [🤫] would be 'r'. But the first guess had 🤫=r and feedback was 'False'. Oh, but maybe the first guess was wrong. Let me check the history again. The first guess was 🤫=r, feedback was False. So 🤫≠r. So \"correct\" is out. Next possibility: \"connect\" (c-o-n-n-e-c-t). So [🤫] would be 'n', but 🐼=n. So that's taken. \"Collect\" (c-o-l-l-e-c-t). [🤫] would be 'l'. That's possible. So \"collect\" → c o l l e c t. So \"co\" + \"ll\" + \"ect\" → \"collect\". So [🤫] is 'l'. Let's check that. Then \"m🐯🤫es\" → m a l es → \"males\". That makes sense. So \"the most dominant males can collect as many as 15-20 [🐮]emails to mate with.\"\n\nNow, \"15-20 🐮em🐯🤫es\" → \"15-20 [🐮]emails\". So \"emails\" is \"em a i l s\". So \"em\" (e m) + \"a\" (🐯) + \"i\" (🐷) + \"l\" (🤫) + \"s\" (es). So \"emails\" → \"emails\". So \"em🐯🤫es\" → \"em a l es\" → \"emales\" (if [🤫] is 'l'). But \"emales\" isn't a word, but maybe \"emails\" is intended here, and perhaps the 'i' is from another emoji. Wait, \"emails\" is e-m-a-i-l-s. The 'i' in \"emails\" would be from 🐷=i. So \"em a i l s\" → \"em a i l s\" → \"emails\". So \"em🐯🐷🤫es\" would be \"em a i l s\", but the encoded part is \"em🐯🤫es\" → \"em a [🤫] es\". So perhaps the 'i' is part of another emoji. Let's check the encoded part again. The original encoded sentence has \"🐮em🐯🤫es\". So \"🐮\" is a single emoji, then \"em\", then \"🐯\", then \"🤫\", then \"es\". So \"🐮\" + \"em\" + \"a\" (🐯) + [🤫] + \"es\". So \"🐮emails\" → \"pemails\" if 🐮=p (but the first guess had 🐮=p and feedback was False). So \"p\" is incorrect. What other letters could \"🐮\" be? Let's think. \"15-20 [🐮]emails\". Maybe \"15-20 email(s)\" → \"15-20 emails\". So [🐮] would be empty, but that's not possible. Alternatively, \"15-20 female emails\" → \"females emails\" → no. \"15-20 male emails\" → \"male emails\". But \"male\" is \"ma l e\" → \"ma[🤫]e\". But \"ma[🤫]es\" is \"males\". So maybe \"15-20 male emails\" → \"male emails\". But \"male\" would be \"ma l e\" → \"ma[🤫]e\". So \"ma[🤫]e\" → \"male\" if [🤫]=l. So \"ma l e\" → \"male\". Then \"males\" (plural) is \"ma l es\". So that works. So \"15-20 male emails\" → \"male emails\". But the encoded part is \"🐮em🐯🤫es\" → \"🐮\" + \"em\" + \"a\" + \"l\" + \"es\" → \"🐮emales\". So \"🐮emales\" → \"male emails\" → \"male emails\" would be \"male emails\", but \"emales\" is part of it. Maybe \"15-20 male emails\" → \"male emails\" → \"male\" + \"emails\". Not sure. Alternatively, \"15-20 email(s)\" → \"emails\". So \"🐮\" could be a possessive, like \"his emails\" → \"his emails\". But \"his\" is 3 letters. \"🐮\" is one emoji, so \"h\" would be \"🐮=h\". Let's check \"🐮emails\" → \"hemails\". Not right. \"Her emails\" → \"her emails\" → \"her\" is 3 letters, \"🐮=h\" → \"hemails\" again. \"Its emails\" → \"its emails\" → \"its\" → \"i t s\", but \"🐮\" is one emoji. Maybe \"the emails\" → \"the emails\". \"the\" is 3 letters, \"🐮=t\" → \"temails\" → \"the emails\" → \"the emails\" → \"t emails\" → no. \"Our emails\" → \"our emails\" → \"our\" is 3 letters. \"15-20 our emails\" → \"our emails\". So \"🐮=o\" → \"oemails\" → \"o emails\" → no. \"15-20 my emails\" → \"my emails\" → \"my\" is 2 letters. \"🐮=m\" → \"memails\" → \"m emails\" → \"my emails\". Not quite. Alternatively, \"15-20 new emails\" → \"new emails\" → \"new\" is 3 letters. \"🐮=n\" → \"nemails\" → \"n emails\" → \"new emails\". Not matching.\n\nLet's move to another part. \"t🥶 m🐯te\" → \"t o m a te\" → \"to mate\". That's correct. Then \"😇🐷th\" → \"w i th\" → \"with\". That's correct.\n\nAnother part: \"🤓🐯🐼\" → \"c a n\" → \"can\". Correct.\n\nSo, back to \"🤫\". If \"co[🤫][🤫]ect\" is \"collect\", then [🤫] = l. Let's test that. Then \"m🐯🤫es\" → \"ma l es\" → \"males\". \"can collect\" → \"can collect\". That makes sense. So \"the most dominant males can collect as many as 15-20 [🐮]emails to mate with.\"\n\nNow, \"em🐯🤫es\" → \"em a l es\" → \"emales\". If \"emales\" is part of \"emails\", maybe \"emails\" is \"em a i l s\" but \"i\" is from 🐷=i, so \"em a i l s\" → \"emails\". So \"em a i l s\" would be \"em\" + \"a\" (🐯) + \"i\" (🐷) + \"l\" (🤫) + \"s\" (es). So \"emails\" → \"emails\". So \"em🐯🐷🤫es\" would be \"emails\", but the encoded part is \"em🐯🤫es\" → \"em a l es\" → \"emales\". Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Maybe \"emails\" is \"emails\", and the \"i\" is part of the \"em\" part. \"em\" could be \"e\" and \"m\" as separate letters, but \"em\" is just a sequence. Let's not get stuck here. Let's focus on the unknowns.\n\nUnknown emojis: 🤫 and 🐮. From the first guess, 🤫≠r, 🐮≠p.\n\nWe need to guess these. Let's assume 🤫=l (as per \"collect\" and \"males\"). Let's check if that works.\n\nIf 🤫=l, then \"co[🤫][🤫]ect\" → \"coll\" → \"collect\". That's good. \"m🐯🤫es\" → \"males\". Good. \"em🐯🤫es\" → \"emales\". Maybe \"emales\" is a typo, but perhaps it's \"emails\" and the 'i' is from another part. Alternatively, maybe \"emails\" is \"emails\" and \"em\" is \"e\" and \"m\" (so \"em\" is just the letters e and m).\n\nNow, \"15-20 🐮em🐯🤫es\" → \"15-20 [🐮]emales\". What could [🐮] be? Maybe \"15-20 female emails\" → \"female emails\". \"Female\" is f-e-m-a-l-e. So \"female\" → \"f em a l e\". So \"females\" → \"f em a l es\". So \"females\" would be \"f\" + \"em a l es\" → \"females\". So \"🐮\" would be 'f'. So \"🐮emales\" → \"females\". That makes sense. \"15-20 females\" → \"15-20 females\". So \"15-20 females emails\" → no, but \"15-20 females\" could be the count. Let's check the sentence again: \"the most dominant males can collect as many as 15-20 females to mate with.\" That makes sense. So \"15-20 females\" → \"females\". So \"🐮emales\" → \"females\" → \"🐮=f\".\n\nSo if 🐮=f, then \"🐮emales\" → \"females\". That works.\n\nSo putting it all together, the guesses would be:\n\nKnown from history (must include them in the answer):\n\n🥶=o, 🐷=i, 🐼=n, 🐯=a, 🤓=c, 🐦=y, 😇=w.\n\nNew guesses:\n\n🤫=l, 🐮=f.\n\nLet's check if these fit.\n\nEncoded sentence with all substitutions:\n\nthe m(o)st d(o)m(i)(n)(a)(n)t m(a)(l)es (c)(a)(n) (c)(o)(l)(l)e(c)t (a)s m(a)(n)(y) (a)s 15 - 20 (f)em(a)(l)es t(o) m(a)te (w)(i)th.\n\nTranslating:\n\nthe most dominant males can collect as many as 15-20 females to mate with.\n\nYes! That makes perfect sense. So \"dominant males can collect as many as 15-20 females to mate with.\" That's a coherent sentence.\n\nSo the correct mappings are:\n\n🥶=o, 🐷=i, 🐼=n, 🐯=a, 🤫=l, 🤓=c, 🐦=y, 🐮=f, 😇=w.\n\nTo solve the Crypto Word Game, we start by analyzing the known emoji-letter mappings from the history and feedback. The feedback confirms the following correct mappings:  \n- 🥶=o, 🐷=i, 🐼=n, 🐯=a, 🤓=c, 🐦=y, 😇=w.  \n\nNext, we substitute these into the encoded sentence to identify unknown emojis (🤫 and 🐮).  \n\n### Step 1: Analyze the encoded sentence with known mappings  \nSubstituting known emojis into the encoded sentence:  \n`the m🥶st d🥶m🐷🐼🐯🐼t m🐯🤫es 🤓🐯🐼 🤓🥶🤫🤫e🤓t 🐯s m🐯🐼🐦 🐯s 15 - 20 🐮em🐯🤫es t🥶 m🐯te 😇🐷th`  \nbecomes:  \n`the most dominant ma🤫es can co🤫🤫ect as many as 15 - 20 🐮emales to mate with`.  \n\n### Step 2: Identify 🤫  \nThe phrase `co🤫🤫ect` is likely \"collect\" (c-o-l-l-e-c-t), suggesting 🤫=l. This fits with `ma🤫es` becoming \"males\" (ma-l-es).  \n\n### Step 3: Identify 🐮  \nThe phrase `15 - 20 🐮emales` is likely \"15-20 females\" (f-emales), so 🐮=f.  \n\n### Final Mappings  \nIncluding all known and newly inferred mappings, the solution is:  \n\nAnswer: 🥶=o,🐷=i,🐼=n,🐯=a,🤫=l,🤓=c,🐦=y,🐮=f,😇=w"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The encoded sentence has emojis replacing letters, and we know that 🐭=s. Let's start by looking at the sentence with that in mind.\n\nFirst, let's substitute 🐭 with s wherever it appears. The encoded sentence becomes:\n\nhe ha[s] al[s]o a🧐🧐ea😎ed 🐹🥵 ma🥵y h🐹🐦hly-accla🐹med telev🐹[s]🐹o🥵 d😎ama[s] [s]uch a[s] the lake[s], [s]tate o🤧 🧐lay a🥵d two 🦆a🤧ta awa😎d-w🐹🥵🥵🐹🥵🐦 [s]e😎🐹al[s]; clock🐹🥵🐦 o🤧🤧 a🥵d [s]e🐰 t😎a🤧🤧🐹c.\n\nLet's break down parts of this. Starting with \"he ha[s] al[s]o\" – that looks like \"he has also\". So \"he has also\" makes sense here. So \"ha[s]\" is \"has\" which fits. Then \"al[s]o\" is \"also\", which is correct. So that checks out.\n\nNext, \"a🧐🧐ea😎ed\" – the structure is \"a\" followed by two emojis, then \"ea\" then another emoji, then \"ed\". So \"a__ea_ed\". Maybe \"adapted\"? Let's see: \"adapted\" would be a-d-a-p-t-e-d. Wait, no. \"a\" + two letters, \"ea\" + a letter + \"ed\". Let's think. Maybe \"a[pp]eased\"? \"app\" + \"eased\" – \"a p p e a s e d\"? Wait, \"a🧐🧐ea😎ed\" would be a + 🧐 + 🧐 + e a + 😎 + e d. So the structure is a (letter) (letter) ea (letter) ed. Let's see: \"appeared\" – a p p e a r e d. Oh! That fits. \"a p p e a r e d\" would be a 🧐 🧐 e a 😎 e d. So if 🧐 is p, then \"a p p e a r e d\" would be a🧐🧐ea😎ed. Because \"pp\" is two 🧐, \"ea\" is e a (which are letters, not emojis here), then 😎 would be r, because \"r\" is the next letter in \"appeared\": a p p e a r e d. So \"appeared\" – a (p)(p) ea (r) ed. So that would make 🧐=p and 😎=r. Let's check that.\n\nIf 😎=r, then \"d😎ama[s]\" becomes \"d r a m a s\" which is \"dramas\". That makes sense. \"dramas\" is a word, so \"d😎ama[s] = dramas\" would fit. So that supports 😎=r.\n\nThen \"ma🥵y\" – \"ma_y\". If \"ma_y\" is \"many\", then \"ma n y\" would make 🥵=n. Let's check. \"ma🥵y\" becomes \"many\" if 🥵=n. That's possible. Let's see other places with 🥵. \"h🐹🐦hly-accla🐹med\" – \"h__hly-accla__med\". Maybe \"highly-acclaimed\". So \"highly\" is h i g h l y. So \"h🐹🐦hly\" would be h + 🐹 + 🐦 + h l y. So \"h i g h l y\" would mean 🐹=i, 🐦=g. Let's check. \"h🐹🐦hly\" = h i g h l y. Then \"accla🐹med\" would be \"acclaimed\" – a c c l a i m e d. Wait, \"accla\" + 🐹 + \"med\". \"acclaimed\" is a c c l a i m e d. So \"accla\" + i + \"med\" (since 🐹=i) would be \"acclai med\" which is \"acclaimed\". That works. So \"accla🐹med\" = acclaimed. So 🐹=i.\n\nThen \"telev🐹[s]🐹o🥵\" – \"telev\" + 🐹 + s + 🐹 + o + 🥵. \"television\" is t e l e v i s i o n. Let's check: \"telev\" (t e l e v) + i (🐹) + s (🐭) + i (🐹) + o + n (🥵). So \"telev\" + i + s + i + o + n = television. That's exactly \"television\". So \"telev🐹🐭🐹o🥵\" = television. That fits perfectly. So 🐹=i, 🐭=s, 🥵=n. That's a good check.\n\nNext, \"d😎ama[s]\" = \"d r a m a s\" (dramas), which we thought earlier. So 😎=r, that works.\n\n\"[s]uch a[s]\" = \"such as\". So \"s u c h a s\" – \"such as\" makes sense. The part after \"the lake[s]\" would be \"the lakes\".\n\n\"[s]tate o🤧\" – \"state o_\". \"state of\" is common, so o🤧=of, so 🤧=f. Let's check. \"state o🤧\" = state of. So 🤧=f.\n\n\"🧐lay\" – if 🧐=p, then \"play\" (p l a y). So \"🧐lay\" = play. That fits. So \"play\" is p l a y, so 🧐=p. That's consistent with earlier \"a🧐🧐ea😎ed\" being \"appeared\" (a p p e a r e d).\n\n\"a🥵d\" – \"a n d\" (if 🥵=n). So \"and\" – a n d. That works. So \"a🥵d\" = and. Good.\n\n\"two 🦆a🤧ta\" – \"two _ a f t a\". Maybe \"two awards\" but no. \"two ... afta\"? \"AFTA\" could be an acronym, but maybe \"two ... a f t a\". Let's think. \"two\" + [word] + \"afta\". Maybe \"two feature films\" but not sure. Alternatively, \"two ... a f t a\". Let's hold that thought.\n\n\"awa😎d-w🐹🥵🥵🐹🥵🐦\" – \"awa r d-w i n n i n g\". Because \"award-winning\" is a w a r d - w i n n i n g. Let's check: \"awa😎d\" = award (a w a r d), so 😎=r (matches earlier). Then \"w🐹🥵🥵🐹🥵🐦\" – w + i (🐹) + n (🥵) + n (🥵) + i (🐹) + n (🥵) + g (🐦). So \"winning\" is w i n n i n g. That's exactly \"w i n n i n g\". So \"w🐹🥵🥵🐹🥵🐦\" = winning. So 🐦=g (since the last letter is g). That fits with \"h🐹🐦hly\" being \"highly\" (h i g h l y), where 🐹=i, 🐦=g.\n\nSo \"awa😎d-w🐹🥵🥵🐹🥵🐦\" = award-winning. Perfect.\n\n\"[s]e😎🐹al[s]\" – \"se r i al s\". \"serials\" – s e r i a l s. So \"se😎🐹al[s]\" = serials. That works. 😎=r, 🐹=i.\n\n\"clock🐹🥵🐦\" – \"clock i n g\". \"clocking\" – c l o c k i n g. So \"clock🐹🥵🐦\" = clocking. 🐹=i, 🥵=n, 🐦=g. That fits.\n\n\"o🤧🤧\" – \"o f f\". So \"off\" – o f f. So 🤧=f, which matches \"state o🤧\" = state of.\n\n\"a🥵d\" – \"a n d\" (and) again.\n\n\"[s]e🐰 t😎a🤧🤧🐹c\" – \"se _ t r a f f i c\". \"traffic\" is t r a f f i c. Let's see. \"t😎a🤧🤧🐹c\" – t + r (😎=r) + a + f (🤧=f) + f (🤧=f) + i (🐹=i) + c. So \"traffic\" – t r a f f i c. That's exactly it. So \"t😎a🤧🤧🐹c\" = traffic. Then \"se🐰\" – \"se _\". The word before \"traffic\" might be \"see traffic\" or \"set traffic\". Let's see. The full part is \"[s]e🐰 t😎a🤧🤧🐹c\" = \"se_ traffic\". Maybe \"see traffic\" – \"see traffic\". So \"se🐰\" = see. Then 🐰=e. Because \"see\" is s e e. So \"se🐰\" = see. So 🐰=e.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nLet's list all emojis we have so far:\n\n🐭=s (given)\n\nFrom \"appeared\" (a🧐🧐ea😎ed = a p p e a r e d): 🧐=p, 😎=r\n\nFrom \"ma🥵y\" (many) and \"a🥵d\" (and): 🥵=n\n\nFrom \"h🐹🐦hly\" (highly) = h i g h l y: 🐹=i, 🐦=g\n\nFrom \"telev🐹🐭🐹o🥵\" (television) = t e l e v i s i o n: confirms 🐹=i, 🐭=s, 🥵=n\n\nFrom \"state o🤧\" (state of): 🤧=f\n\nFrom \"🧐lay\" (play) = p l a y: confirms 🧐=p\n\nFrom \"awa😎d-w🐹🥵🥵🐹🥵🐦\" (award-winning): confirms 😎=r, 🐹=i, 🥵=n, 🐦=g\n\nFrom \"se😎🐹al[s]\" (serials): confirms 😎=r, 🐹=i, 🐭=s\n\nFrom \"clock🐹🥵🐦\" (clocking): confirms 🐹=i, 🥵=n, 🐦=g\n\nFrom \"o🤧🤧\" (off): confirms 🤧=f\n\nFrom \"t😎a🤧🤧🐹c\" (traffic): confirms 😎=r, 🤧=f, 🐹=i\n\nFrom \"se🐰\" (see): 🐰=e\n\nNow, the remaining emoji is 🦆. Let's check where 🦆 appears: \"two 🦆a🤧ta\". We have \"two _ a f t a\". Let's see. Maybe \"two films afta...\" but \"afta\" could be a typo or part of a name. Alternatively, \"two ... afta\" could be \"two drama afta...\" but not sure. Let's look at the context. The full sentence is: \"two 🦆a🤧ta awa😎d-w🐹🥵🥵🐹🥵🐦 [s]e😎🐹al[s]; clock🐹🥵🐦 o🤧🤧 a🥵d [s]e🐰 t😎a🤧🤧🐹c.\"\n\n\"two 🦆a🤧ta awa😎d-w🐹🥵🥵🐹🥵🐦\" = \"two _ a f t a award-winning...\". Maybe \"two feature afta...\" but \"feature\" is f e a t u r e. No, not matching. Alternatively, \"two ... afta\" could be \"two shows afta...\" but not sure. Let's see if there's another occurrence. The only other emoji is 🦆, which we haven't assigned yet. Let's think of possible words. The part \"two 🦆a🤧ta\" – \"two [X]afta\". Maybe \"two drama afta...\" but \"drama\" is d r a m a. Alternatively, \"two ... afta\" could be part of a title. Let's check if \"🦆a🤧ta\" could be \"awards\" but \"awards\" is a w a r d s. No. \"Afta\" could be \"AFTA\" (Asian Film Television Awards?), but perhaps \"two [something] AFTA...\". Alternatively, maybe \"two ... afta\" is \"two ... after\". \"After\" is a f t e r. But \"a🤧ta\" is a f t a. \"a f t a\" could be \"afta\" (a typo for \"after\") but not sure. Let's think of the letters we have. The letters used so far: s, p, r, n, i, g, f, e. The alphabet letters not used yet (assuming all letters are unique) could be t, a, c, l, o, w, b, d, etc. Let's see:\n\nLooking at \"two 🦆a🤧ta\" – \"two [letter] a f t a\". Let's say \"two d a f t a\" – \"two dafta\" doesn't make sense. \"two t a f t a\" – \"two tafta\" (maybe a name). Alternatively, \"two m a f t a\" – \"two mafta\". Not helpful. Alternatively, maybe \"two ... afta\" is part of \"two ... award-winning\". Wait, the structure is \"two 🦆a🤧ta awa😎d-w🐹🥵🥵🐹🥵🐦\" which is \"two [X]afta award-winning...\". If \"award-winning\" is already covered, perhaps \"Xafta\" is a title. Maybe \"BAFTA\" (British Academy Film Television Awards). BAFTA is B A F T A. Oh! That fits. \"BAFTA\" is B A F T A. So \"two 🦆a🤧ta\" would be \"two BAFTA\". Because \"BAFTA\" is B A F T A. So \"🦆a🤧ta\" = B A F T A. Since 🤧=f, \"a🤧ta\" is a f t a. So \"🦆\" would be B. So \"two 🦆a🤧ta\" = two BAFTA. That makes sense. So 🦆=b.\n\nLet's check that. \"BAFTA\" is B A F T A. So \"🦆a🤧ta\" = B A F T A. 🦆=b, 🤧=f. That works. So \"two BAFTA award-winning...\" would make sense. So 🦆=b.\n\nLet's verify all the emojis:\n\n🐭=s (given)\n\n🧐=p (from appeared, play)\n\n😎=r (from appeared, dramas, award, serials)\n\n🥵=n (from many, and, winning)\n\n🐹=i (from highly, acclaimed, television, winning, clocking, traffic)\n\n🐦=g (from highly, winning, clocking)\n\n🤧=f (from of, off, traffic)\n\n🐰=e (from see)\n\n🦆=b (from BAFTA)\n\nLet's check all parts with these substitutions:\n\nEncoded Sentence with substitutions:\n\nhe ha[s] al[s]o a[p][p]ea[r]ed [i][n] ma[n]y h[i][g]hly-accla[i]med telev[i][s][i]o[n] d[r]ama[s] [s]uch a[s] the lake[s], [s]tate o[f] [p]lay a[n]d two [b]a[f]ta awa[r]d-w[i][n][n][i][n][g] [s]e[r][i]al[s]; clock[i][n][g] o[f][f] a[n]d [s]e[e] t[r]a[f][f][i]c.\n\nNow let's convert that to actual words:\n\n\"he has also appeared in many highly-acclaimed television dramas such as the lakes, state of play and two BAFTA award-winning serials; clocking off and see traffic.\"\n\nWait, let's check each part:\n\n\"he ha[s] al[s]o\" → he has also. Correct.\n\n\"a🧐🧐ea😎ed\" → a p p e a r e d → appeared. Correct.\n\n\"🐹🥵\" → i n → in. Correct.\n\n\"ma🥵y\" → ma n y → many. Correct.\n\n\"h🐹🐦hly\" → h i g h l y → highly. Correct.\n\n\"accla🐹med\" → accla i med → acclaimed. Correct (acclaimed is a c c l a i m e d; \"acclai med\" → acclaimed).\n\n\"telev🐹🐭🐹o🥵\" → telev i s i o n → television. Correct.\n\n\"d😎ama[s]\" → d r a m a s → dramas. Correct.\n\n\"[s]uch a[s]\" → such as. Correct.\n\n\"the lake[s]\" → the lakes. Correct.\n\n\"[s]tate o🤧\" → state of. Correct.\n\n\"🧐lay\" → p l a y → play. Correct.\n\n\"a🥵d\" → a n d → and. Correct.\n\n\"two 🦆a🤧ta\" → two b a f t a → two BAFTA. Correct (BAFTA is a known award).\n\n\"awa😎d-w🐹🥵🥵🐹🥵🐦\" → awa r d-w i n n i n g → award-winning. Correct.\n\n\"[s]e😎🐹al[s]\" → se r i al s → serials. Correct.\n\n\"clock🐹🥵🐦\" → clock i n g → clocking.

So all the emojis are correctly mapped.\n\nTo solve the Crypto Word Game, we start with the given hint 🐭=s and analyze the encoded sentence to deduce other emoji-letter mappings. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Key Deductions:\n1. **he ha🐭 al🐭o** → \"he has also\" (🐭=s confirmed).  \n2. **a🧐🧐ea😎ed** → \"appeared\" (a + p + p + ea + r + ed → 🧐=p, 😎=r).  \n3. **ma🥵y** → \"many\" (ma + n + y → 🥵=n).  \n4. **h🐹🐦hly** → \"highly\" (h + i + g + hly → 🐹=i, 🐦=g).  \n5. **telev🐹🐭🐹o🥵** → \"television\" (telev + i + s + i + o + n → confirms 🐹=i, 🐭=s, 🥵=n).  \n6. **d😎ama🐭** → \"dramas\" (d + r + ama + s → confirms 😎=r, 🐭=s).  \n7. **state o🤧** → \"state of\" (o + f → 🤧=f).  \n8. **🧐lay** → \"play\" (p + lay → confirms 🧐=p).  \n9. **a🥵d** → \"and\" (a + n + d → confirms 🥵=n).  \n10. **awa😎d-w🐹🥵🥵🐹🥵🐦** → \"award-winning\" (awa + r + d-w + i + n + n + i + n + g → confirms 😎=r, 🐹=i, 🥵=n, 🐦=g).  \n11. **se😎🐹al🐭** → \"serials\" (se + r + i + al + s → confirms 😎=r, 🐹=i, 🐭=s).  \n12. **clock🐹🥵🐦** → \"clocking\" (clock + i + n + g → confirms 🐹=i, 🥵=n, 🐦=g).  \n13. **o🤧🤧** → \"off\" (o + f + f → confirms 🤧=f).  \n14. **se🐰 t😎a🤧🤧🐹c** → \"see traffic\" (se + e + t + r + a + f + f + i + c → 🐰=e).  \n15. **two 🦆a🤧ta** → \"two BAFTA\" (two + B + a + f + t + a → 🦆=b, as BAFTA is a known award).  \n\n### Final Mappings:\nAll emojis are mapped as follows:  \n🐭=s, 🧐=p, 😎=r, 🥵=n, 🐹=i, 🐦=g, 🤧=f, 🐰=e, 🦆=b.\n\nAnswer: 🐭=s,🧐=p,😎=r,🥵=n,🐹=i,🐦=g,🤧=f,🐰=e,🦆=b","Okay, let's try to figure out the next guess. First, let's list out all the emojis and their current known mappings based on the history and feedback. \n\nFrom the first attempt, the feedback says that 🐭=s (correct), 🧐=p (correct), 😎=r (correct), 🥵=n (correct), 🐹=i (correct), 🐦=g (correct), 🤧=f (correct), 🐰=e (incorrect), and 🦆=b (correct). So the known ones are:\n\n🐭=s\n🧐=p\n😎=r\n🥵=n\n🐹=i\n🐦=g\n🤧=f\n🦆=b\n\nThe only incorrect one from the first guess was 🐰=e. So we need to figure out what 🐰 should be instead. Let's look at the encoded sentence and substitute the known emojis to see where 🐰 appears.\n\nLet's replace each known emoji in the encoded sentence:\n\nOriginal: he ha🐭 al🐭o a🧐🧐ea😎ed 🐹🥵 ma🥵y h🐹🐦hly-accla🐹med telev🐹🐭🐹o🥵 d😎ama🐭 🐭uch a🐭 the lake🐭, 🐭tate o🤧 🧐lay a🥵d two 🦆a🤧ta awa😎d-w🐹🥵🥵🐹🥵🐦 🐭e😎🐹al🐭; clock🐹🥵🐦 o🤧🤧 a🥵d 🐭e🐰 t😎a🤧🤧🐹c.\n\nSubstituting known emojis:\n\nhe ha[s] al[s]o a[pp]ea[r]ed [i][n] ma[n]y h[i][g]hly-accla[i]med telev[i][s][i]o[n] d[r]ama[s] [s]uch a[s] the lake[s], [s]tate o[f] [p]lay a[n]d two [b]a[f]ta awa[r]d-w[i][n][n][i][n][g] [s]e[r][i]al[s]; clock[i][n][g] o[f][f] a[n]d [s]e[🐰] t[r]a[f][f][i]c.\n\nNow let's parse the substituted sentence to find the words and look for the unknown emoji 🐰. Let's break it down word by word:\n\n- \"he ha[s]\" → \"he has\" (so \"ha[s]\" is \"has\" → correct, since s is the 3rd person singular)\n- \"al[s]o\" → \"also\" (so that's correct, s is correct)\n- \"a[pp]ea[r]ed\" → \"appeared\" (pp is p, r is r → \"appeared\" makes sense)\n- \"[i][n] ma[n]y\" → \"in many\" (i is i, n is n → correct)\n- \"h[i][g]hly\" → \"highly\" (i and g → \"highly\" makes sense)\n- \"accla[i]med\" → \"acclaimed\" (i → \"acclaimed\" is correct, since \"acclaimed\" has 'i'? Wait, \"acclaimed\" is a-c-c-l-a-i-m-e-d. Oh, right, \"acclaimed\" has an 'i' there. So that's correct.\n- \"telev[i][s][i]o[n]\" → \"televisio[n]\" → \"television\" (so \"televisio\" + \"n\" → \"television\". That works. So i, s, i, n → \"television\" is correct.\n- \"d[r]ama[s]\" → \"drama[s]\" → \"dramas\" (r and s → correct)\n- \"[s]uch a[s]\" → \"such as\" (s → correct)\n- \"the lake[s]\" → \"the lakes\" (s → correct)\n- \"[s]tate o[f]\" → \"state of\" (s and f → correct)\n- \"[p]lay a[n]d two\" → \"play and two\" (p and n → correct)\n- \"[b]a[f]ta\" → \"bafta\" (b, f, t, a? Wait, \"bafta\" is a known award (British Academy Film Television Awards). So \"bafta\" → [b][a][f][t]a? Wait, the encoded part is \"🦆a🤧ta\" → 🦆=b, 🤧=f. So \"b a f t a\" → \"bafta\" (since \"bafta\" is B-A-F-T-A). So that makes sense. So \"two bafta awards...\" → yes.\n- \"awa[r]d-w[i][n][n][i][n][g]\" → \"award-winning\" (r, i, n, n, i, n, g → \"award-winning\" → correct)\n- \"[s]e[r][i]al[s]\" → \"serial[s]\" → \"serials\" (s, r, i, s → \"serials\" makes sense)\n- \"clock[i][n][g]\" → \"clocking\" (i, n, g → \"clocking\" is correct)\n- \"o[f][f]\" → \"off\" (f, f → \"off\")\n- \"a[n]d [s]e[🐰]\" → \"and se[🐰]\"\n- \"t[r]a[f][f][i]c\" → \"traffic\" (r, f, f, i, c → \"traffic\" is correct. Because \"traffic\" is t-r-a-f-f-i-c. So substituting, t[r]a[f][f][i]c → \"traffic\" → correct. So that part is \"traffic\".\n\nNow, looking at the part \"a[n]d [s]e[🐰]\" → \"and se[🐰]\". Let's see the context. The full sentence after substitution up to that point is: \"... clocking off and se[🐰] traffic.\"\n\nWait, let's reconstruct the entire sentence step by step:\n\nEncoded sentence after substitution:\n\nhe has also a[pp]eared in many highly-acclaimed television drama[s] such as the lakes, state of play and two bafta award-winning serial[s]; clocking off and se[🐰] traffic.\n\nAh, \"clocking off and se[🐰] traffic.\" The word before \"traffic\" is \"se[🐰]\". So \"se[🐰]\" + \"traffic\". Let's think of possible words. The structure is \"se[X] traffic\". What could that be?\n\nPossible words: \"see traffic\" (but \"se\" + \"e\" would be \"see\" → \"se\" + \"e\" → \"see\", but then \"se[🐰]\" would be \"see\" → 🐰=e. But the first guess had 🐰=e, which was incorrect. So maybe not.\n\nAnother possibility: \"set traffic\" → \"se\" + \"t\" → \"set\" → 🐰=t. \"set traffic\" → \"set traffic\" (maybe \"set traffic\" as in directing traffic?), but \"set traffic\" doesn't sound right.\n\nWait, maybe \"see\" is not correct. Let's check the previous part. The sentence is: \"clocking off and se[🐰] traffic.\" \"Clocking off\" means stopping work. Then \"and se[X] traffic.\" Maybe \"seeing traffic\"? \"se[X]ing traffic\"? No, because the structure here is \"se[X] traffic\" (without a 'ing'). Let's look at the exact substitution.\n\nThe part in the encoded sentence is: \"🐭e🐰 t😎a🤧🤧🐹c\" → substituting known emojis: \"s e [🐰] t r a f f i c\". So \"s e [🐰] t r a f f i c\" → \"se[X] traffic\". So the word is \"se[X] traffic\".\n\nWait, the original encoded part is \"🐭e🐰 t😎a🤧🤧🐹c\" → which becomes \"s e [🐰] t r a f f i c\". So \"se[X] traffic\". So \"se[X]\" is a word followed by \"traffic\".\n\nWhat's a word that starts with \"se\" and is followed by \"traffic\"? Maybe \"see traffic\" (se + e → see). But the first guess had 🐰=e, which was wrong. So maybe \"segue traffic\"? No, that doesn't fit. \"Seal traffic\"? \"seal\" → \"seal traffic\" (unlikely). \"Seat traffic\"? \"seat traffic\" (possible, but \"seat\" is s-e-a-t. So \"se[X]\" would be \"sea\" if X=a → \"seat\" would be \"sea t\". So \"sea t traffic\"? That's \"seat traffic\". Maybe. Let's check if \"seat traffic\" makes sense. Not really. \n\nAlternatively, \"send traffic\"? \"se\" + \"n\" → \"sen\" → \"send\" would be s-e-n-d. But \"se[X]\" would need to be \"sen\" → X=n. But \"send traffic\" → \"send traffic\" (maybe in a context like directing traffic). Let's see if \"n\" is already used. 🥵=n is already correct. So X can't be n.\n\nAnother possibility: \"seek traffic\"? \"se\" + \"e\" → \"see\", but that's back to e. \"seek\" is s-e-e-k. So \"se[X]\" would be \"see\" if X=e. But again, first guess had 🐰=e, which was wrong.\n\nWait, let's check the entire structure again. The part is \"🐭e🐰 t😎a🤧🤧🐹c\" → s e [🐰] t r a f f i c. So \"se[X] traffic\". Let's think of \"se\" followed by a single letter to make a word. For example, \"sea\" (s-e-a), \"sec\" (s-e-c), \"sed\" (s-e-d), \"seg\" (s-e-g), \"seh\" (uncommon), \"sei\" (uncommon), \"sel\" (s-e-l), \"sem\" (s-e-m), \"sen\" (s-e-n), \"sep\" (s-e-p), \"ser\" (s-e-r), \"ses\" (s-e-s), \"set\" (s-e-t), \"seu\" (uncommon), \"sev\" (uncommon), \"sew\" (s-e-w), \"sex\" (s-e-x), \"sey\" (uncommon), \" sez\" (uncommon).\n\nWhich of these could fit in \"se[X] traffic\"? Let's think of possible phrases. \"See traffic\" (se + e) but e was wrong. \"Set traffic\" (se + t) → \"set traffic\" (maybe \"set traffic\" as in setting up traffic controls). \"Sex traffic\" (se + x) → \"sex traffic\" (like human trafficking, but \"sex traffic\" is possible). \"Sea traffic\" (se + a) → \"sea traffic\" (ships in the sea). \"Seg traffic\" (unlikely). \"Ser traffic\" (unlikely). \"Sem traffic\" (unlikely). \"Sen traffic\" (unlikely). \"Sed traffic\" (unlikely). \"Sec traffic\" (security traffic? Maybe, but \"sec\" is short for security, so \"sec traffic\" could be possible). \n\nLet's look at the rest of the sentence. The entire encoded sentence, after substitution, is:\n\nhe has also appeared in many highly-acclaimed television dramas such as the lakes, state of play and two bafta award-winning serials; clocking off and se[X] traffic.\n\n\"Clocking off\" (ending work) and then \"se[X] traffic\". Maybe \"seeing traffic\" (but X=e was wrong). Alternatively, \"setting traffic\" (X=t). Let's check if \"set traffic\" makes sense. \"Clocking off and setting traffic\" (maybe as in a traffic controller). Alternatively, \"seal traffic\" (X=a) → \"seal traffic\" (unlikely). \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"se\" is part of a longer word. Wait, \"se[X] traffic\" could be \"see traffic\" but \"see\" is s-e-e. So \"se[X]\" would be \"see\" if X=e, but the first guess said 🐰=e was wrong. So maybe \"see\" is not it. \n\nAlternatively, let's check the word before. The part before \"se[X] traffic\" is \"clocking off and\". So \"clocking off and [verb] traffic\". What verbs go with traffic? \"Direct traffic\", \"manage traffic\", \"control traffic\", \"monitor traffic\", \"watch traffic\", \"see traffic\". \"Watch traffic\" would be \"watch traffic\" → \"wa\" + \"tch\". But that's not matching. \"See traffic\" is possible. \"Monitor traffic\" is longer. \n\nWait, \"se[X]\" could be \"see\" (if X=e) but the first guess said 🐰=e was wrong. So maybe X is another letter. Let's think of other possibilities. Let's check the letters that are not yet used. The known letters are s, p, r, n, i, g, f, b. The letters in the alphabet not used yet (assuming all letters are unique) could be a, c, d, e, h, j, k, l, m, o, q, t, u, v, w, x, y, z. Wait, but \"e\" was guessed as 🐰=e and was wrong, so \"e\" is not 🐰. Let's list the letters used so far:\n\nFrom the known mappings:\n\n🐭=s → s\n🧐=p → p\n😎=r → r\n🥵=n → n\n🐹=i → i\n🐦=g → g\n🤧=f → f\n🦆=b → b\n\nSo the letters used are s, p, r, n, i, g, f, b. The remaining letters are a, c, d, e, h, j, k, l, m, o, q, t, u, v, w, x, y, z.\n\nLooking at \"se[X] traffic\", X could be a letter from the remaining ones. Let's check possible words:\n\n- \"sea\" (a): \"sea traffic\" → possible (ocean traffic). So X=a. Then 🐰=a.\n- \"sec\" (c): \"sec traffic\" (security traffic) → possible. X=c.\n- \"sed\" (d): \"sed traffic\" (unlikely).\n- \"seg\" (g): but g is already used (🐦=g).\n- \"sel\" (l): \"sel traffic\" (unlikely).\n- \"sem\" (m): \"sem traffic\" (unlikely).\n- \"sen\" (n): n is used (🥵=n).\n- \"sep\" (p): p is used (🧐=p).\n- \"ser\" (r): r is used (😎=r).\n- \"ses\" (s): s is used (🐭=s).\n- \"set\" (t): \"set traffic\" (possible). X=t.\n- \"sew\" (w): \"sew traffic\" (unlikely).\n- \"sex\" (x): \"sex traffic\" (possible, but maybe not the intended word here).\n- \"sey\" (y): \"sey traffic\" (unlikely).\n\nSo possible candidates for X are a, c, t, x. Let's check the rest of the sentence for other clues.\n\nLooking at another part of the encoded sentence: \"h🐹🐦hly\" → h[i][g]hly → \"highly\" (correct). \"accla🐹med\" → accla[i]med → \"acclaimed\" (correct). \"telev🐹🐭🐹o🥵\" → telev[i][s][i]o[n] → \"television\" (correct). \"d😎ama🐭\" → d[r]ama[s] → \"dramas\" (correct). \"🐭uch\" → [s]uch → \"such\" (correct). \"a🐭\" → a[s] → \"as\" (correct). \"lake🐭\" → lake[s] → \"lakes\" (correct). \"🐭tate\" → [s]tate → \"state\" (correct). \"o🤧\" → o[f] → \"of\" (correct). \"🧐lay\" → [p]lay → \"play\" (correct). \"a🥵d\" → a[n]d → \"and\" (correct). \"two 🦆a🤧ta\" → two [b]a[f]ta → \"two bafta\" (correct, since BAFTA is an award). \"awa😎d\" → awa[r]d → \"award\" (correct). \"w🐹🥵🥵🐹🥵🐦\" → w[i][n][n][i][n][g] → \"winning\" (correct). \"🐭e😎🐹al🐭\" → [s]e[r][i]al[s] → \"serials\" (correct). \"clock🐹🥵🐦\" → clock[i][n][g] → \"clocking\" (correct). \"o🤧🤧\" → o[f][f] → \"off\" (correct). \"a🥵d\" → a[n]d → \"and\" (correct). \"t😎a🤧🤧🐹c\" → t[r]a[f][f][i]c → \"traffic\" (correct). \n\nAll these substitutions make sense, so the known mappings are correct. Now, the only unknown is 🐰. The part where 🐰 appears is \"🐭e🐰\" → \"s e [🐰]\". So \"se[X]\". Let's think again. The full phrase is \"se[X] traffic\". If \"se[X]\" is \"see\", then X=e, but the first guess said 🐰=e was wrong, so that's not it. If \"se[X]\" is \"set\", then X=t. \"set traffic\" could be possible. Let's check if \"t\" is available. The letters used are s, p, r, n, i, g, f, b. \"t\" is not used yet, so that's possible.\n\nAnother angle: Let's check if there's another occurrence of 🐰. Looking at the encoded sentence, the only place 🐰 appears is in \"🐭e🐰 t😎a🤧🤧🐹c\" → \"se[X] traffic\". So that's the only occurrence. \n\nIf we assume that the sentence is about television dramas, awards, etc., \"clocking off and set traffic\" might not fit. Alternatively, \"clocking off and see traffic\" (but X=e was wrong). Maybe \"clocking off and sex traffic\"? That's possible but maybe not. \"Sea traffic\" could be about ships, but the context is television. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"se[X]\" is part of a longer word. Let's check the entire word. The encoded part is \"🐭e🐰\" → \"s e [🐰]\". So it's a 3-letter word: s-e-X. What 3-letter words start with \"se\"?\n\nPossible 3-letter words:\n\n- sea (s-e-a)\n- sec (s-e-c)\n- sed (s-e-d)\n- see (s-e-e)\n- seg (s-e-g)\n- sei (s-e-i)\n- sel (s-e-l)\n- sem (s-e-m)\n- sen (s-e-n)\n- sep (s-e-p)\n- ser (s-e-r)\n- ses (s-e-s)\n- set (s-e-t)\n- sew (s-e-w)\n- sex (s-e-x)\n- sey (s-e-y)\n- sez (s-e-z)\n\nFrom these, the ones with letters not yet used (excluding e, since 🐰=e was wrong) are:\n\nsea (a), sec (c), sed (d), seg (g, used), sei (i, used), sel (l), sem (m), sen (n, used), sep (p, used), ser (r, used), ses (s, used), set (t), sew (w), sex (x), sey (y), sez (z).\n\nSo possible candidates: a, c, d, l, m, t, w, x, y, z.\n\nWhich of these make sense in \"se[X] traffic\"? Let's think of \"sea traffic\" (a) → possible. \"sec traffic\" (c) → maybe \"security traffic\". \"sed traffic\" (d) → no. \"sel traffic\" (l) → no. \"sem traffic\" (m) → no. \"set traffic\" (t) → possible. \"sew traffic\" (w) → no. \"sex traffic\" (x) → possible. \"sey traffic\" (y) → no. \"sez traffic\" (z) → no.\n\nGiven the context of television dramas, maybe \"see traffic\" (but e is wrong), \"set traffic\" (t), or \"sex traffic\" (x). Alternatively, \"sea traffic\" (a) if it's about a maritime drama. \n\nBut let's check if there's any other part of the sentence that might give a clue. The sentence mentions \"television dramas such as the lakes, state of play...\". \"State of Play\" is a known TV drama\/miniseries. \"The Lakes\" is also a TV show. \"Bafta award-winning serials\" makes sense. \"Clocking off\" is a British TV drama series. Oh! \"Clocking Off\" is a real TV series. So the sentence is listing TV dramas: \"such as The Lakes, State of Play and two Bafta award-winning serials; Clocking Off and [seX] Traffic.\" \n\nAh! \"Traffic\" is also a TV series. There's a TV series called \"Traffic\". So \"Clocking Off and [seX] Traffic\" → \"Clocking Off and Traffic\" would make sense. But \"Traffic\" is just \"Traffic\", so maybe \"seX\" is part of the title. Wait, there's a TV series called \"Sex Traffic\" which is about human trafficking. That's a possibility. So \"Clocking Off and Sex Traffic\". If that's the case, then \"se[X]\" would be \"sex\", so X=x. Then 🐰=x.\n\nAlternatively, \"See Traffic\" isn't a known series. \"Set Traffic\" isn't. \"Sea Traffic\" isn't. \"Sex Traffic\" is a known TV series (2004 miniseries). That fits. So if the sentence is listing TV dramas: The Lakes, State of Play, two Bafta award-winning serials; Clocking Off and Sex Traffic. That makes sense. \n\nSo \"se[X]\" would be \"sex\", so X=x. Therefore, 🐰=x.\n\nLet's confirm: \"🐭e🐰\" → s-e-x → \"sex\". Then \"sex traffic\" would be the title of a TV series. That fits the context. So the correct mapping for 🐰 is x.\n\nTo solve this round, we start by analyzing the known emoji-letter mappings from the history and feedback. The first guess provided several correct mappings: 🐭=s, 🧐=p, 😎=r, 🥵=n, 🐹=i, 🐦=g, 🤧=f, 🦆=b. Only 🐰=e was incorrect. \n\nNext, we substitute the known emojis into the encoded sentence to identify the context around the unknown emoji 🐰. The critical segment containing 🐰 is: \"🐭e🐰 t😎a🤧🤧🐹c\" → substituting known emojis gives \"s e [🐰] t r a f f i c\" → \"se[X] traffic\". \n\nThe sentence lists television dramas, including \"Clocking Off\" (a real TV series) and \"traffic\" (likely another series). A known TV series related to trafficking is \"Sex Traffic,\" which fits the context. Thus, \"se[X]\" should be \"sex,\" making 🐰=x.\n\nAnswer: 🐭=s,🧐=p,😎=r,🥵=n,🐹=i,🐦=g,🤧=f,🐰=x,🦆=b"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The encoded sentence is: \"🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\" And we know that 👽=n. Let's start by breaking down the sentence with the known emoji.\n\nFirst, substitute 👽 with n. Let's rewrite the sentence parts:\n\n- \"i👽\" becomes \"in\" (since i + n = in, which is a common preposition)\n- \"e👽t\" becomes \"ent\" (maybe part of a word like \"sent\" or \"went\")\n- \"e👽🐻\" becomes \"en🐻\" (could be \"end\" if 🐻=d, or \"ent\" but that's covered, or \"eng\" maybe)\n- \"t🤭 🤖👽\" becomes \"t🤭 🤖n\" (maybe \"the man\" if 🤖=m and 🤭=h? Let's see)\n- \"w🤖🐶\" becomes \"w🤖🐶\" (could be \"word\" if 🤖=o and 🐶=r, but let's check other parts)\n- \"c🤭🐨es\" becomes \"c🤭🐨es\" (maybe \"classes\" if 🤭=l, 🐨=a? \"classes\" is c-l-a-sses, so c🤭🐨es would be c l a sses? That fits. Let's check: c + 🤭 + 🐨 + es = classes. So 🤭=l, 🐨=a? Then \"c🤭🐨es\" = classes. That seems possible.\n\nLooking at \"i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t\". Let's substitute 👽=n, so \"in🦆🤭l🦆e🐨ent\". Let's break it down. If 🤭=l, then \"in🦆l l🦆e🐨ent\" (but that's repeating l). Maybe not. Let's think again. \"i👽🦆🤭l\" would be \"in🦆🤭l\". If the word starts with \"in\", maybe \"instruct\" or \"inflate\"? Let's see \"inflate\": i-n-f-l-a-t-e. Let's check: \"i👽🦆🤭l\" would be i-n-🦆-🤭-l. If \"inflate\" is i-n-f-l-a-t-e, then maybe \"inflate\" here. Let's see the next part: \"🦆e🐨e👽t\" = 🦆-e-🐨-e-n-t. If \"inflate\" is i-n-f-l-a-t-e, then \"inflate\" would be i👽 (in) + 🦆 (f) + 🤭 (l) + l (maybe that's part of the word). Wait, maybe \"inflate\" is i-n-f-l-a-t-e. Let's check: \"i👽🦆🤭l\" = i-n-f-l-l? No, that's not right. Alternatively, \"involve\"? i-n-v-o-l-v-e. Then \"i👽🦆🤭l\" would be i-n-v-o-l. So 👽=n, 🦆=v, 🤭=o, l is l. Then \"involve\" would be i-n-v-o-l-v-e. Let's see: \"i👽🦆🤭l\" = i-n-v-o-l. Then \"l🦆e🐨e👽t\" would be l-v-e-🐨-e-n-t. So \"lve🐨ent\". Maybe \"involve\" + \"lvent\"? Not sure.\n\nAnother part: \"t🦁e\" is likely \"the\" since \"the\" is very common. So t + 🦁 + e = the. So 🦁=h. That's a good guess. So t🦁e = the. So 🦁=h.\n\nThen \"w🤖🐶\" would be \"w🤖🐶\". If \"the w🤖🐶\" is \"the word\", then w + 🤖 + 🐶 = word. So w-o-r-d. So 🤖=o, 🐶=r. Let's check: w🤖🐶 = w-o-r = wor, which would make \"the word\" possible (since \"w-o-r-d\" but maybe the encoded part is \"w🤖🐶\" as \"wor\" and the d is elsewhere? Or maybe \"the work\" (w-o-r-k), but let's see.\n\n\"c🤭🐨es\" is \"c🤭🐨es\". If \"classes\" is c-l-a-sses, then c + 🤭(l) + 🐨(a) + s + es. So \"classes\" would be c l a s es. So \"c🤭🐨es\" = classes. That fits. So 🤭=l, 🐨=a. Then \"c🤭🐨es\" = classes.\n\nLet's check \"t🤭 🤖👽\" = t + 🤭 + (space) + 🤖 + 👽. If 🤭=l, 🤖=o, 👽=n, then \"t l o n\". That doesn't make sense. If \"t🤭\" is \"th\" (t + h), but 🦁=h. Maybe \"t🤭\" is \"to\" (t + o), so 🤭=o. Then \"t🤭\" = to. Then \"🤖👽\" = 🤖 + n. If \"to the man\" then \"the man\" would be t🦁e (the) m👽 (man). Wait, maybe \"🤖👽\" is \"man\" (m + n). So 🤖=m. Then \"t🤭 🤖👽\" = t + 🤭 + m + n. Maybe \"the man\" but \"t🤭\" would be \"th\" (t + h), so 🤭=h. Then \"t🤭\" = th, and \"🤖👽\" = m + n = mn? No. \"man\" is m-a-n, but 👽=n. So \"man\" would be m + 🐨 + n. If 🐨=a, then \"m🐨n\" = man. So maybe \"e👽🐻\" is \"end\" (e + n + d), so 🐻=d. Then \"e👽🐻\" = end.\n\nLet's try to piece together the sentence:\n\nEncoded: 🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\n\nSubstituting 👽=n, and possible others:\n\nAssume:\n\n👽=n (given)\n\n🦁=h (since t🦁e = the)\n\nSo t🦁e = the.\n\nThen \"i👽\" = in (i + n = in)\n\n\"i👽 t🦁e\" = in the.\n\n\"w🤖🐶\" could be \"word\" if 🤖=o, 🐶=r. So w + o + r = wor. Maybe \"the word\" is \"the word\", so \"w🤖🐶\" = word (w-o-r-d, but maybe the d is in another emoji).\n\n\"c🤭🐨es\" could be \"classes\" (c-l-a-sses). So c + l + a + s + es. So 🤭=l, 🐨=a. Then \"c🤭🐨es\" = classes.\n\n\"t🤭\" could be \"to\" (t + o), but if 🤭=l, then \"t l\". Maybe \"t🤭\" is \"the\" but t + h is the, but 🦁=h. Alternatively, \"t🤭\" is \"it\" but no.\n\nLooking at \"e👽t\" = ent. If \"e👽t\" is \"ent\", maybe part of \"sent\" (s + ent). The sentence starts with \"🐵. s. i👽...\". So \"s.\" could be \"s.\" as in a sentence fragment, maybe \"s.\" is \"s\" (like a word). \"i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t\" = in🦆🤭l🦆e🐨ent. If \"inflate\" is i-n-f-l-a-t-e, then \"inflate\" would be i-n-f-l-a-t-e. Let's check: \"i👽\" = in (i-n), \"🦆\"=f, \"🤭\"=l, \"l\"=l, \"🦆\"=f, \"e\"=e, \"🐨\"=a, \"e👽t\"=ent. So \"i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t\" = in-f-l-l-f-e-a-ent? That doesn't fit. Maybe \"involve\" (i-n-v-o-l-v-e). So \"i👽\"=in, \"🦆\"=v, \"🤭\"=o, \"l\"=l, \"🦆\"=v, \"e\"=e, \"🐨\"=a, \"e👽t\"=ent. So \"involveaent\"? No.\n\nAnother angle: \"e👽🐻\" = en🐻. If \"end\" then 🐻=d. So \"en🐻\"=end.\n\n\"🤖👽\" = 🤖n. If \"man\" is m-a-n, but 👽=n, so maybe \"man\" is 🤖n, so 🤖=m. Then \"🤖👽\"=mn? No. \"men\" is m-e-n, but 👽=n. Maybe \"men\" would be 🤖e👽, so not here. \"🤖👽\" could be \"on\" (o-n) if 🤖=o. So \"on\". Then \"t🤭 🤖👽\" = t🤭 on. Maybe \"it on\" but \"t🤭\" would be \"it\"? No, t is the first letter. Maybe \"to on\" (t🤭=to, so 🤭=o). Then \"to on\".\n\nLet's try some guesses step by step. We know 👽=n. Let's list the emojis present: 🐵, 👽, 🦆, 🤭, 🐨, 🦁, 🤖, 🐶, 🐻.\n\nThe hint is 👽=n. We need to guess others. Let's make a list:\n\n- 👽=n (given, must include)\n- Let's assume 🦁=h (since t🦁e is likely \"the\")\n- Then t🦁e = the. So 🦁=h.\n- \"w🤖🐶\" could be \"word\" (w-o-r-d). Let's say 🤖=o, 🐶=r. So w🤖🐶=wor (maybe \"word\" is w-o-r-d, but the d is 🐻? If \"e👽🐻\"=end, then 🐻=d. So e👽🐻=end. Then \"d\" is 🐻=d.\n- \"c🤭🐨es\" could be \"classes\" (c-l-a-sses). So 🤭=l, 🐨=a. Then c🤭🐨es=classes.\n- \"i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t\" = in🦆l l🦆e a ent. If \"inflate\" is i-n-f-l-a-t-e, then \"inflate\" would be i👽 (in) + 🦆 (f) + 🤭 (l) + l (maybe part of the word) + 🦆 (f) + e (e) + 🐨 (a) + e👽t (ent). So \"inflate\" would be in-f-l-f-e-a-ent? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, \"instruct\" (i-n-s-t-r-u-c-t). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, \"i👽🦆🤭l\" could be \"intel\" (i-n-t-e-l). So 👽=n, 🦆=t, 🤭=e. Then \"intel\" is i-n-t-e-l. Then \"l🦆e🐨e👽t\" = l-t-e-🐨-e-n-t. Maybe \"lte...ent\". Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look for repeated emojis. Let's list the frequency:\n\n👽 appears 5 times (i👽, e👽t, i👽, e👽t, e👽🐻, maybe more). 👽 is given as n, which is common.\n\n🦆 appears 2 times (i👽🦆🤭l, l🦆e)\n🤭 appears 3 times (i👽🦆🤭l, c🤭🐨es, t🤭)\n🐨 appears 2 times (l🦆e🐨e, c🤭🐨es)\n🦁 appears 1 (t🦁e)\n🤖 appears 2 (w🤖🐶, 🤖👽)\n🐶 appears 1 (w🤖🐶)\n🐻 appears 1 (e👽🐻)\n🐵 appears 1 (start)\n\nSo 🤭 is the next most frequent. Let's think: 🤭 is in \"c🤭🐨es\" (ends with \"es\", so plural). \"c🤭🐨es\" could be \"classes\" (c-l-a-sses), \"cities\" (c-i-t-ies), \"cakes\" (c-a-k-es) but no. \"classes\" is a common word. So if \"classes\", then \"c l a s es\" → c🤭🐨es → 🤭=l, 🐨=a. That's a good guess.\n\nThen \"c🤭🐨es\" = classes. So 🤭=l, 🐨=a.\n\nNext, \"t🦁e\" is likely \"the\", so 🦁=h.\n\nThen \"w🤖🐶\" could be \"word\" (w-o-r-d). If \"the word\", then \"w o r d\". So \"w🤖🐶\" = w o r → \"wor\" (maybe the d is elsewhere). Let's say 🤖=o, 🐶=r.\n\n\"t🤭\" is \"t l\" (since 🤭=l). Maybe \"t l\" is part of \"told\" (t-o-l-d), but not sure. \"t🤭\" could be \"to\" if 🤭=o, but we guessed 🤭=l. Alternatively, \"t🤭\" is \"it\" but no, starts with t.\n\n\"e👽🐻\" = e n 🐻. If \"end\", then 🐻=d. So e n d = end.\n\n\"i👽\" = in (i + n), which is correct.\n\n\"i👽 t🦁e\" = in the. That makes sense.\n\n\"i👽🦆🤭l\" = in 🦆 l l. If \"inflate\" is i-n-f-l-a-t-e, then \"inflate\" would be i👽 (in) + 🦆 (f) + 🤭 (l) + l (maybe a typo or repetition?), but \"inflate\" is i-n-f-l-a-t-e. So \"i👽🦆🤭l\" would be i-n-f-l-l? That's \"inffl\"? No. Maybe \"involve\" (i-n-v-o-l-v-e). If \"i👽🦆🤭l\" is i-n-v-o-l, then 🦆=v, 🤭=o. Then \"involve\" would be i-n-v-o-l-v-e. Let's check: \"i👽🦆🤭l\" = i-n-v-o-l. Then \"l🦆e🐨e👽t\" = l-v-e-a-e-n-t. So \"lveaent\". Maybe \"involve a ent\"? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, \"i👽🦆🤭l\" could be \"interl\" (i-n-t-e-r-l). So 👽=n, 🦆=t, 🤭=e, then \"interl\". Then \"l🦆e🐨e👽t\" = l-t-e-a-e-n-t → \"lteaent\". Not helpful.\n\nLet's try to build the sentence with the current guesses:\n\nGuesses so far:\n\n👽=n (given)\n\n🦁=h (t🦁e=the)\n\n🤭=l (c🤭🐨es=classes)\n\n🐨=a (c🤭🐨es=classes)\n\n🤖=o (w🤖🐶=wor)\n\n🐶=r (w🤖🐶=wor)\n\n🐻=d (e👽🐻=end)\n\nNow, let's substitute all into the encoded sentence:\n\nEncoded: 🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\n\nSubstituted:\n\n🐵. s. i n 🦆 l l 🦆 e a e n t i n t h e w o r c l a s es t l o n e n d.\n\nHmm, \"i n 🦆 l l 🦆 e a e n t\" could be \"inflate\" (i-n-f-l-a-t-e). Let's check: i-n (👽=n) -f (🦆=f) -l (🤭=l) -a (🐨=a) -t-e. So \"inflate\" would be i👽 (in) + 🦆 (f) + 🤭 (l) + e (e) + 🐨 (a) + e👽t (ent)? Wait, \"i👽🦆🤭l\" = i-n-f-l (infl), \"🦆e🐨e👽t\" = f-e-a-ent (feaent). So \"inflfeaent\"? No. Maybe \"instruct\" (i-n-s-t-r-u-c-t), but not matching.\n\nAlternatively, \"i👽🦆🤭l\" is \"intel\" (i-n-t-e-l). So 🦆=t, 🤭=e. Then \"intel\" is i-n-t-e-l. Then \"l🦆e🐨e👽t\" = l-t-e-a-e-n-t → \"lteaent\". Maybe \"intel ...\"\n\nAnother part: \"s.\" could be \"s\" as a word, like \"s\" for \"see\" or \"say\".\n\nThe first part is \"🐵. s. ...\". Maybe \"A. s. ...\" where 🐵=a.\n\nPutting it all together, maybe the sentence is: \"A. s. Inflate in the word classes to on end.\" But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, \"A. s. Intel in the word classes to men end.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"He. s. Inflate in the word classes to on end.\" But not sure.\n\nBut since this is the first attempt, we need to make guesses. Let's list the emojis and our best guesses:\n\n👽=n (given)\n\n🦁=h (t🦁e=the)\n\n🤭=l (c🤭🐨es=classes)\n\n🐨=a (c🤭🐨es=classes)\n\n🤖=o (w🤖🐶=word)\n\n🐶=r (w🤖🐶=word)\n\n🐻=d (e👽🐻=end)\n\n🦆=f (i👽🦆🤭l=infl (inflate))\n\n🐵=a (first word could be \"A.\")\n\nSo the guesses would be:\n\n🐵=a, 👽=n, 🦆=f, 🤭=l, 🐨=a, 🦁=h, 🤖=o, 🐶=r, 🐻=d.\n\nWait, but 🐨=a and 🐵=a? No, each emoji must correspond to a unique letter. Oh right! Each emoji is a unique letter. So I made a mistake earlier. 🐨 and 🐵 can't both be a. Oops. So need to correct that.\n\nSo 🐨=a, then 🐵 can't be a. Let's adjust. Maybe 🐵=h, but 🦁=h. No. 🐵 could be s? No, \"s.\" is separate. Maybe 🐵=i? No. \"A. s. ...\" → 🐵=a, which is unique. So 🐨 must be another letter. Let's redo \"c🤭🐨es\". If \"c🤭🐨es\" is \"cities\", then c-i-t-ies. So 🤭=i, 🐨=t. Then \"cities\". That's possible. So 🤭=i, 🐨=t. Then \"c🤭🐨es\" = cities.\n\nThen \"t🦁e\"=the → 🦁=h.\n\n\"w🤖🐶\"=word → 🤖=o, 🐶=r.\n\n\"e👽🐻\"=end → 🐻=d.\n\n\"i👽\"=in → 👽=n.\n\n\"t🤭\"=t + i → \"ti\"? Maybe \"it\" but no. \"t🤭\" could be \"to\" if 🤭=o, but 🤖=o. So unique.\n\nAlternatively, \"c🤭🐨es\"=cakes → c-a-k-es. So 🤭=a, 🐨=k. Then \"cakes\".\n\nBut \"cakes\" is less likely than \"classes\" or \"cities\".\n\nLet's try \"cities\" (c-i-t-ies). So 🤭=i, 🐨=t. Then \"c🤭🐨es\" = cities.\n\nThen \"i👽🦆🤭l\" = i-n-🦆-i-l. Maybe \"initial\" (i-n-i-t-i-a-l). No, but \"initial\" is i-n-i-t-i-a-l. So \"i👽🦆🤭l\" = i-n-🦆-i-l. If \"initial\" is i-n-i-t-i-a-l, then \"i👽\"=in, 🦆=i (but 👽=n, 🦆=i would be unique). Then \"i👽🦆🤭l\" = i-n-i-i-l. No, that's \"in i i l\".\n\nAlternatively, \"insect\" (i-n-s-e-c-t). \"i👽🦆🤭l\" = i-n-s-e-l. Maybe \"insel\"? Not a word.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at \"i👽 t🦁e\" which is \"in the\" (if 👽=n, 🦁=h). That makes sense. So \"in the\" is a common phrase.\n\n\"w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es\" → \"w🤖🐶 classes\" (if c🤭🐨es=classes). So \"word classes\" → \"w🤖🐶\"=word. So 🤖=o, 🐶=r, 🤭=l, 🐨=a (since classes is c-l-a-sses). So \"w o r d\" → \"word\". So \"w🤖🐶\"=word. Then 🤖=o, 🐶=r.\n\n\"t🤭 🤖👽\" → \"t l o n\" (if 🤭=l, 🤖=o, 👽=n). Maybe \"told\" (t-o-l-d), but \"t l o n\" isn't. Alternatively, \"to the man\" → \"t l o n\" not matching.\n\n\"e👽🐻\"=end → 🐻=d.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence could be: \"A. s. Inflate in the word classes to on end.\" But \"A. s.\" could be \"As. s.\" or \"A. So.\"\n\nBut the key is to list the emojis with their guessed letters, including the hint (👽=n) and any others. So the answer should include 👽=n and other guesses. Let's make the best possible guesses with unique letters:\n\n- 👽=n (given)\n- 🦁=h (t🦁e=the)\n- 🤖=o (w🤖🐶=word)\n- 🐶=r (w🤖🐶=word)\n- 🤭=l (c🤭🐨es=classes)\n- 🐨=a (c🤭🐨es=classes)\n- 🐻=d (e👽🐻=end)\n- 🦆=f (i👽🦆🤭l=infl (inflate))\n- 🐵=s (maybe the first word is \"S.\")\n\nWait, but \"s.\" is already in the encoded sentence. The first part is \"🐵. s. ...\". So \"🐵. s. ...\" could be \"A. s. ...\" where 🐵=a. So 🐵=a.\n\nSo the emojis and their letters:\n\n🐵=a, 👽=n, 🦆=f, 🤭=l, 🐨=a → no, can't repeat a. Oops, 🐨 can't be a if 🐵=a. So need to change. Let's pick 🐨=s. Then \"c🤭🐨es\" = c🤭s es. Maybe \"causes\" (c-a-u-s-es). So 🤭=a, 🐨=u. \"causes\" would be c-a-u-s-es. So c🤭🐨es = c a u s es. That works. So 🤭=a, 🐨=u.\n\nThen \"c🤭🐨es\"=causes.\n\n\"i👽🦆🤭l\"=i-n-🦆-a-l. Maybe \"instal\" (i-n-s-t-a-l). So 🦆=s. Then \"instal\" is i-n-s-t-a-l. So \"i👽🦆🤭l\"=i-n-s-a-l. No, \"instal\" is i-n-s-t-a-l. So maybe 🦆=t, then \"i-n-t-a-l\" → \"intal\" (not a word).\n\nAlternatively, \"inflate\" (i-n-f-l-a-t-e). So \"i👽\"=in, 🦆=f, 🤭=l, then \"i-n-f-l\" → infl. Then \"l🦆e🐨e👽t\"=l-f-e-🐨-e-n-t. If \"inflate\" is i-n-f-l-a-t-e, then \"l-f-e-a-e-n-t\" → lfeaent. Maybe \"inflate\" is followed by \"in the word causes to on end.\"\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's list all emojis and assign letters based on common words:\n\nEmojis present: 🐵, 👽, 🦆, 🤭, 🐨, 🦁, 🤖, 🐶, 🐻.\n\nKnown: 👽=n.\n\nCommon letters: e, t, a, o, i, s, h, r, d.\n\nAssume:\n\n- 🦁=h (t🦁e=the)\n- 🤖=o (w🤖🐶=word)\n- 🐶=r (w🤖🐶=word)\n- 🐻=d (e👽🐻=end)\n- 🤭=l (c🤭🐨es=classes)\n- 🐨=a (c🤭🐨es=classes)\n- 🦆=f (i👽🦆🤭l=infl (inflate))\n- 🐵=s (first word could be \"S.\")\n\nBut 🐨=a and 🐵=s are unique. So the guesses would be:\n\n🐵=s, 👽=n, 🦆=f, 🤭=l, 🐨=a, 🦁=h, 🤖=o, 🐶=r, 🐻=d.\n\nLet's check if these are all unique: s, n, f, l, a, h, o, r, d. Yes, all unique.\n\nNow, substitute into the sentence:\n\nEncoded: 🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\n\nSubstituted:\n\ns. s. in f l l f e a e n t in the word classes t l o n end.\n\nHmm, \"s. s.\" could be \"S. S.\" or \"So. s.\". The rest: \"inflate in the word classes to on end.\" Maybe \"inflate\" is \"inflfeaent\" but that's a stretch. However, given the constraints, these are plausible guesses.\n\nTo solve the Crypto Word Game, we start by analyzing the encoded sentence and the given hint (👽=n). We then look for common English words and patterns to deduce the remaining emojis. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **👽=n** (given hint, must include).  \n2. **t🦁e** is likely \"the\" (most common three-letter word), so 🦁=h.  \n3. **w🤖🐶** is likely \"word\" (common noun), so 🤖=o (w + o + r = wor, part of \"word\") and 🐶=r.  \n4. **c🤭🐨es** ends with \"es\" (plural), suggesting \"classes\" (common plural noun). Thus, c + l + a + s + es → 🤭=l and 🐨=a.  \n5. **e👽🐻** is likely \"end\" (common word), so e + n + d → 🐻=d.  \n6. **i👽🦆🤭l** could be \"inflate\" (common verb), where i + n + f + l → 🦆=f (since \"inflate\" starts with \"infl\").  \n7. The first fragment \"🐵. s.\" might be \"S. s.\" (a sentence start), so 🐵=s.  \n\nAll emojis are assigned unique letters, and the substitutions align with common English words.  \n\nAnswer: 🐵=s,👽=n,🦆=f,🤭=l,🐨=a,🦁=h,🤖=o,🐶=r,🐻=d","Okay, let's try to figure this out. The encoded sentence is: 🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻. \n\nFirst, the hint is 👽=n, which was confirmed in the history. The first attempt had some feedback. Let's list the emojis and their feedback:\n\nFrom the first guess:\n- 🐵=s → False\n- 👽=n → True (so we keep this)\n- 🦆=f → False\n- 🤭=l → False\n- 🐨=a → False\n- 🦁=h → True (so 🦁=h)\n- 🤖=o → False\n- 🐶=r → True (so 🐶=r)\n- 🐻=d → True (so 🐻=d)\n\nSo confirmed emojis so far: 👽=n, 🦁=h, 🐶=r, 🐻=d.\n\nNow let's substitute those into the encoded sentence. Let's go step by step.\n\nOriginal sentence with substitutions:\nEncoded: 🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\nAfter substituting known emojis (👽=n, 🦁=h, 🐶=r, 🐻=d):\n→ 🐵. s. i n 🦆 🤭 l 🦆 e 🐨 e n t i n t h e w 🤖 r c 🤭 🐨 e s t 🤭 🤖 n e n d.\n\nLet's parse this. Let's split into words where possible. Let's look at spaces. The sentence structure might have words separated by spaces. Let's split the encoded sentence into parts based on spaces and punctuation.\n\nBreaking down:\n\n1. 🐵. → Maybe a word ending with a period. Could be a name or a short word. First attempt guessed s, but that was wrong. Let's see.\n\n2. s. → Maybe \"s.\" as in a single letter with a period, like an abbreviation.\n\n3. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t → i n 🦆 🤭 l 🦆 e 🐨 e n t. Let's split this into parts. Let's see: \"i\" is likely \"I\" (capitalized?), but in the encoded sentence it's lowercase. So maybe \"i\" is \"i\". Then \"n\" (👽) is next. So \"i n 🦆 🤭 l 🦆 e 🐨 e n t\". Let's see possible words. Let's count letters. Let's see: i (1) n (2) 🦆 (3) 🤭 (4) l (5) 🦆 (6) e (7) 🐨 (8) e (9) n (10) t (11). So 11 letters. Let's see possible words. Maybe \"in\" is part of it. Let's think: \"in\" + something. Let's see: \"i n [3] [4] l [6] e [8] e n t\". Let's look for patterns. For example, the 3rd and 6th characters are both 🦆, so same letter. So 3 and 6 positions are same. Let's say 3 = x, 6 = x. Then 4 is y. So \"i n x y l x e z e n t\". Let's think of 11-letter words. Maybe \"interesting\"? Let's check: i-n-t-e-r-e-s-t-i-n-g? No, length is 11. Let's count: i(1)n(2)t(3)e(4)r(5)e(6)s(7)t(8)i(9)n(10)g(11). That's 11 letters. Let's see. Our current part is i n x y l x e z e n t. Comparing to \"interesting\": positions 1-2: i n (matches). 3: t, 4: e, 5: r, 6: e, 7: s, 8: t, 9: i, 10: n, 11: t. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, maybe \"instruments\"? Let's check: i-n-s-t-r-u-m-e-n-t-s? No, length 11. i(1)n(2)s(3)t(4)r(5)u(6)m(7)e(8)n(9)t(10)s(11). Our part ends with \"t\" (position 11), so \"instruments\" would end with s, but our part ends with t, so no.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the next part: \"i👽 t🦁e\" → i n t h e. Oh, \"i n t h e\" → \"in the\". That's a common phrase. So \"i👽 t🦁e\" → \"in the\". So \"i👽\" is \"in\", which fits 👽=n. So \"i n t h e\" → \"in the\". That makes sense. So \"i👽 t🦁e\" → \"in the\". So that part is clear.\n\nThen \"w🤖🐶\" → w 🤖 r. \"w [🤖] r\". What's a 3-letter word starting with w and ending with r? \"war\" (w-a-r), \"wry\" (w-r-y, but here the middle is 🤖, so 3rd letter is r). So \"war\" would be w a r. So if 🤖=a, then \"war\" → w a r. Let's note that possibility: 🤖=a.\n\nNext part: \"c🤭🐨es\" → c 🤭 🐨 e s. Let's see. \"c [🤭] [🐨] es\". Maybe \"candles\"? No, but \"c...es\" could be plural. Let's think: \"cakes\" is c a k e s (5 letters: c a k e s). Our part is c [1] [2] e s → 5 letters. So \"c [1] [2] e s\". If \"cakes\", then [1] is a, [2] is k. But let's check other parts.\n\nNext: \"t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻\" → t 🤭 [🤖] n e n d. Let's parse that. \"t [🤭] [🤖] n e n d\". Let's split into words. Maybe \"t [🤭]\" is \"to\" if 🤭=o. Then \"[🤖] n\" could be \"an\" if 🤖=a, which aligns with the earlier \"w🤖🐶\" possibly being \"war\" (w a r). Let's check: if 🤖=a, then \"🤖👽\" is a n → \"an\". Then \"e👽🐻\" is e n d → \"end\". So \"e👽🐻\" → e n d → \"end\" (matches 🐻=d). That's correct. So \"e👽🐻\" is \"end\".\n\nSo \"t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻\" → t [🤭] a n e n d. Let's split into words. Maybe \"to an end\"? So \"t [🤭]\" → \"to\" → t o → so 🤭=o. Then \"t o a n e n d\" → \"to an end\". That makes sense. So \"t🤭\" → \"to\" → 🤭=o.\n\nLet's check that. If 🤭=o, then \"t🤭\" is \"to\". Then \"c🤭🐨es\" → c o [🐨] e s. Let's think of 5-letter words: \"comes\" is c o m e s. So \"c o m e s\" → \"comes\". That would fit. So if 🐨=m, then \"c o m e s\" → \"comes\". Let's check that.\n\nNow, let's go back to the earlier part: \"i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t\" → i n 🦆 o l 🦆 e m e n t. Let's see. Let's split into words. Let's see: \"i n [🦆] o l [🦆] e m e n t\". Let's count letters: i(1) n(2) x(3) o(4) l(5) x(6) e(7) m(8) e(9) n(10) t(11). 11 letters. Let's think of a possible word. Maybe \"involvement\"? Let's check: i-n-v-o-l-v-e-m-e-n-t. Yes! That's 11 letters. Let's check each position:\n\n1: i (correct)\n2: n (correct)\n3: v (so 🦆=v)\n4: o (correct, since 🤭=o)\n5: l (correct)\n6: v (so 🦆=v, which matches position 3)\n7: e (correct)\n8: m (so 🐨=m)\n9: e (correct)\n10: n (correct)\n11: t (correct)\n\nYes! \"involvement\" fits. So that part would be \"involvement\". Let's confirm:\n\ni👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t → i n v o l v e m e n t → \"involvement\". Perfect. So that suggests:\n\n🦆=v (since positions 3 and 6 are 🦆, which are 'v' in 'involvement'),\n\n🤭=o (position 4 is o),\n\n🐨=m (position 8 is m).\n\nLet's check other parts with these.\n\nNow, let's check \"s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\"\n\nSubstituting all the current guesses:\n\n👽=n, 🦁=h, 🐶=r, 🐻=d, 🦆=v, 🤭=o, 🐨=m, 🤖=a.\n\nLet's substitute each emoji:\n\nEncoded sentence parts:\n\n1. 🐵. → unknown, first attempt guessed s (wrong)\n2. s. → \"s.\" (maybe \"s.\" as in a name's initial)\n3. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t → i n v o l v e m e n t → \"involvement\"\n4. i👽 → i n → \"in\"\n5. t🦁e → t h e → \"the\"\n6. w🤖🐶 → w a r → \"war\"\n7. c🤭🐨es → c o m e s → \"comes\"\n8. t🤭 → t o → \"to\"\n9. 🤖👽 → a n → \"an\"\n10. e👽🐻 → e n d → \"end\"\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence becomes:\n\n🐵. s. involvement in the war comes to an end.\n\nThat makes sense! So the first part \"🐵. \" is likely a name or a word ending with a period. Let's think: the sentence structure would be something like \"[Name]. s. involvement in the war comes to an end.\" Maybe \"It. s. ...\" but \"It\" would be \"it\", but \"it.\" with a period. Alternatively, \"He. s. ...\" but \"He.\" seems odd. Alternatively, \"The. s. ...\" but \"The.\" would be odd. Alternatively, \"This. s. ...\" No. Alternatively, maybe \"War. s. ...\" but \"war\" is already in the sentence. Alternatively, \"Love. s. ...\" Not sure. Let's check the first part \"🐵. \" which is a word ending with a period, maybe a single letter? Like \"X. s. ...\". But the first attempt guessed 🐵=s (wrong), so it's not 's'. Let's think of possible 1-letter words with a period. Maybe \"I.\" (as in \"I. s. ...\"), but \"I\" would be capitalized. Alternatively, \"A. s. ...\" (A. s. involvement...). \"A. s.\" could be \"A's\" but that's possessive. Alternatively, maybe \"It. s. ...\" (It. s. involvement...) → \"It. s. involvement...\" which could be \"It's involvement...\" but the apostrophe is missing. Alternatively, maybe \"The. s. ...\" (The. s. involvement...). Alternatively, maybe the first word is \"This\" → \"This. s. ...\" but \"This.\" with a period. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, but perhaps the first word is \"His\". Let's check: \"His. s. involvement...\" No, that's not right. Alternatively, \"Her. s. ...\" Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first word is \"What\" → \"What. s. ...\" No. Alternatively, \"How. s. ...\" Not sure. Let's see. The rest of the sentence makes sense with the substitutions. Let's confirm the other parts again.\n\nThe word \"w🤖🐶\" → w a r → \"war\" (since 🤖=a, 🐶=r). That works.\n\n\"c🤭🐨es\" → c o m e s → \"comes\" (🤭=o, 🐨=m). Correct.\n\n\"t🤭\" → t o → \"to\" (🤭=o). Correct.\n\n\"🤖👽\" → a n → \"an\" (🤖=a, 👽=n). Correct.\n\n\"e👽🐻\" → e n d → \"end\" (👽=n, 🐻=d). Correct.\n\n\"t🦁e\" → t h e → \"the\" (🦁=h). Correct.\n\n\"i👽\" → i n → \"in\" (👽=n). Correct.\n\n\"i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t\" → i n v o l v e m e n t → \"involvement\" (👽=n, 🦆=v, 🤭=o, 🐨=m). Correct.\n\nSo the only unknown is 🐵. The first attempt guessed s (wrong). Let's think: the first word is \"🐵. \" followed by \"s. \". Maybe \"s.\" is a typo or abbreviation. Let's see: \"s.\" could be \"s\" as in a plural, but perhaps \"s.\" is \"S.\" (a name initial). So \"X. S. involvement...\" Maybe \"X\" is a person's initial. For example, \"J. S. involvement...\" So \"J.\" would be the first word. If 🐵=j, then \"J. S. involvement in the war comes to an end.\" That makes sense. Alternatively, \"M. S. ...\" etc. Since we need to guess, perhaps \"🐵=j\" is a possibility. Alternatively, maybe \"It. s. ...\" but \"it\" is \"i t\", but the first word is 🐵. (single emoji, so one letter). So \"It.\" would be two letters (I and t), but here 🐵 is a single emoji, so one letter. So the first word is one letter followed by a period. So \"A. s. ...\", \"B. s. ...\", etc. Let's pick a common one. Maybe \"A. s. ...\" → \"A. s. involvement...\" Maybe \"A's\" but that's possessive. Alternatively, \"O. s. ...\" No. Alternatively, \"U. s. ...\" → \"U. S. involvement...\" (U.S. for United States). That makes sense! \"U. S. involvement in the war comes to an end.\" That's a possible sentence. So if 🐵=u, then \"U. S. involvement in the war comes to an end.\" That works. Let's check. The first attempt guessed 🐵=s (wrong), so \"u\" is possible.\n\nSo putting it all together, the guesses would be:\n\n👽=n (correct, must include),\n\n🦆=v,\n\n🤭=o,\n\n🐨=m,\n\n🦁=h (correct),\n\n🤖=a,\n\n🐶=r (correct),\n\n🐻=d (correct),\n\n🐵=u.\n\nLet's verify all substitutions:\n\nEncoded Sentence: 🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\n\nSubstituted:\n\nu. s. i n v o l v e m e n t i n t h e w a r c o m e s t o a n e n d.\n\nWhich is: \"U. S. involvement in the war comes to an end.\" That makes perfect sense!\n\nYes, that works. So the guesses would be:\n\n🐵=u, 👽=n, 🦆=v, 🤭=o, 🐨=m, 🦁=h, 🤖=a, 🐶=r, 🐻=d.\n\nTo solve the Crypto Word Game, we start by analyzing the encoded sentence, the confirmed feedback from the first attempt, and the provided hint. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Confirmed Emojis (from History Feedback):\n- 👽=n (Hint, confirmed)\n- 🦁=h (Feedback: True)\n- 🐶=r (Feedback: True)\n- 🐻=d (Feedback: True)\n\n### Substituting Confirmed Emojis into the Encoded Sentence:\nThe encoded sentence becomes:  \n`🐵. s. i n 🦆 🤭 l 🦆 e 🐨 e n t i n t h e w 🤖 r c 🤭 🐨 e s t 🤭 🤖 n e n d.`\n\n### Analyzing Key Phrases:\n1. **\"i👽 t🦁e\"** → \"i n t h e\" → \"in the\" (confirms structure).  \n2. **\"e👽🐻\"** → \"e n d\" → \"end\" (matches 🐻=d).  \n3. **\"w🤖🐶\"** → \"w 🤖 r\" → Likely \"war\" (3-letter word starting with \"w\" and ending with \"r\"), so 🤖=a.  \n4. **\"t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻\"** → \"t 🤭 a n e n d\" → Likely \"to an end\", so 🤭=o (making \"t🤭\" → \"to\").  \n5. **\"c🤭🐨es\"** → \"c o 🐨 e s\" → Likely \"comes\" (5-letter word), so 🐨=m.  \n6. **\"i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t\"** → \"i n 🦆 o l 🦆 e m e n t\" → Likely \"involvement\" (11-letter word), so 🦆=v (since positions 3 and 6 are \"v\" in \"involvement\").  \n\n### Determining the Remaining Emoji (🐵):\nThe first part of the sentence is `🐵. s.`, which likely refers to \"U. S.\" (United States) as a common abbreviation. Thus, 🐵=u.\n\n### Final Guesses:\nAll confirmed and inferred emojis are:  \n🐵=u, 👽=n, 🦆=v, 🤭=o, 🐨=m, 🦁=h, 🤖=a, 🐶=r, 🐻=d.\n\nAnswer: 🐵=u,👽=n,🦆=v,🤭=o,🐨=m,🦁=h,🤖=a,🐶=r,🐻=d"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The encoded sentence is given, and we know that 🥴=e. First, I need to analyze the sentence and look for patterns, especially with the known emoji.\n\nLet's start by writing down the encoded sentence with 🥴 replaced by e. Let's list all the emojis and their positions:\n\nOriginal: 🐱🐯🐮🐨g🥴🐮🥳🥴r, 🐮🥳🥴 🐭🐨ns🐮🥴🐯🐯🐱🐮i🐨n 🐭🐨n🐮🐱ins 🐱🥺🐨u🐮 50 g🐱🐯🐱xi🥴s 🐨🥺s🥴r🤩🐱🥺🐯🥴 🐮🥳r🐨ug🥳 🐱🦆🐱🐮🥴ur 🐮🥴🐯🥴s🐭🐨p🥴.\n\nReplacing 🥴 with e: 🐱🐯🐮🐨g e 🐮🥳 e r, 🐮🥳 e 🐭🐨ns🐮 e 🐯🐯🐱🐮i🐨n 🐭🐨n🐮🐱ins 🐱🥺🐨u🐮 50 g🐱🐯🐱xi e s 🐨🥺s e r🤩🐱🥺🐯 e 🐮🥳r🐨ug🥳 🐱🦆🐱🐮 e ur 🐮 e 🐯 e s🐭🐨p e.\n\nLet's break this into parts. Let's look for common words or structures. The first part is \"🐱🐯🐮🐨g e 🐮🥳 e r,\" which ends with a comma. Maybe it's a clause like \"..., \" so the comma is after that. Let's look at the \"e r\" at the end of that part. If it's a word ending with \"er\", maybe \"her\", \"per\", \"the\", etc. The structure before that is \"🐮🥳 e\". So \"🐮🥳 e r\" would be \"🐮🥳 er\". Let's think about the next part: \"🐮🥳 e 🐭🐨ns🐮 e 🐯🐯🐱🐮i🐨n\". Maybe \"the\" is a common word. Let's check if \"🐮🥳 e\" could be \"the\". If 🐮=t, 🥳=h, then \"🐮🥳 e\" would be \"the e\"? Wait, no, \"🐮🥳 e\" would be \"t h e\"? Wait, no. Let's see. If \"🐮🥳 e\" is \"the\", then \"🐮\" is t, \"🥳\" is h, and \"e\" is e (which we already know). That could work. Let's test that. So 🐮=t, 🥳=h.\n\nSo replacing those: \"t h e r,\". So \"ther,\"? Maybe \"there,\". Let's check. The first part: 🐱🐯 t 🐨g e t h e r, ... So \"🐱🐯 t 🐨g ether,\". Maybe \"together\"? Let's see. \"together\" is t o g e t h e r. Wait, \"together\" would be t o g e t h e r. So the first part would be \"🐱🐯 t 🐨g e t h e r,\". Let's break down \"together\": t o g e t h e r. So positions: t (position 3) is 🐮=t. Then \"o\" would be the next letter. Let's see the first three emojis: 🐱🐯🐮. So \"🐱🐯 t\" would be \"?? t\". If \"together\" is the word, then \"tog\" is the start. \"tog\" is t o g. So \"tog\" would be t (🐮) o (🐯) g (🐱)? Wait, \"tog\" is t o g. So \"t\" is 🐮, \"o\" would be 🐯, \"g\" would be 🐱. Let's check: \"🐱🐯🐮\" would be g o t. But \"together\" starts with t o g. So \"t o g e t h e r\" would be t (🐮) o (🐯) g (🐱) e (🥴) t (🐮) h (🥳) e (🥴) r. So the first part would be \"g o t 🐨g e t h e r,\". Wait, \"together\" is t o g e t h e r. So the first part is 🐱🐯🐮🐨g e 🐮🥳🥴r. Let's map each position:\n\n1: 🐱\n\n2: 🐯\n\n3: 🐮\n\n4: 🐨\n\n5: g\n\n6: 🥴 (e)\n\n7: 🐮 (t)\n\n8: 🥳\n\n9: 🥴 (e)\n\n10: r\n\nSo 1-10: 🐱🐯🐮🐨g e t 🥳 e r. If this is \"together\", then \"together\" is t o g e t h e r. Let's count letters: t(1), o(2), g(3), e(4), t(5), h(6), e(7), r(8). So positions 1-8: t o g e t h e r. So the encoded part here is positions 1-10: 🐱🐯🐮🐨g e t 🥳 e r. Let's compare:\n\n\"together\" is t o g e t h e r. So the letters would be:\n\n1: t → but in the encoded sentence, position 3 is 🐮. So maybe position 3 is t (so 🐮=t). Then \"together\" would be:\n\npositions 3 (t) + 2 (o) + 1 (g) → but that's reversed. Alternatively, maybe the first word is \"something\" else. Let's look at \"g\" in position 5. The original sentence has \"g\" as a letter, which is not replaced by an emoji. So \"g\" is a real letter. So the encoded sentence has some letters (like g, r, n, s, i, u, 50, x, etc.) that are not replaced. That might be a clue. Let's list all the non-emoji characters: g, r, n, s, i, u, 50, x. So the sentence includes these letters. \n\nLooking at \"g🥴\" which is \"g e\" (since 🥴=e). So \"ge\" could be part of a word like \"get\", \"gem\", \"gel\", etc. The part after that is \"🐮🥳🥴r\" which is \"🐮🥳 e r\". If \"ge\" is \"ge\", and then \"🐮🥳 e r\" could be \"the r\" (if 🐮=t, 🥳=h), making \"gether\". So \"g e t h e r\" → \"gether\". That's part of \"together\". So the first part might be \"Together,\". So \"Together,\" would be T o g e t h e r, with a comma. Let's check:\n\nEncoded first part: 🐱🐯🐮🐨g🥴🐮🥳🥴r, → letters: 🐱 🐯 🐮 🐨 g e 🐮 🥳 e r,\n\nIf \"Together,\" is the word, then T o g e t h e r, → letters: T(1), o(2), g(3), e(4), t(5), h(6), e(7), r(8), comma(9). So the encoded part would map:\n\nT → 🐱?\n\no → 🐯?\n\ng → 🐮?\n\ne → 🐨? But we know that 🥴=e, so that's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the \"g\" in position 5 is part of \"get\". Let's look at \"g🥴🐮\" which is \"g e 🐮\". If \"ge\" is \"ge\", then \"ge🐮\" could be \"get\" (if 🐮=t). So \"g e t\" → \"get\". Then \"🥳🥴r\" is \"🥳 e r\". If \"get\" is \"g e t\", then \"🥳 e r\" could be \"her\" (if 🥳=h). So \"get her\" → \"gether\". So \"g e t h e r\" → \"gether\". So the first part is \"🐱🐯🐮🐨gether,\". Maybe \"Together,\" with capital T. So \"T o g e t h e r,\". So T would be 🐱, o=🐯, g=🐮, e=🐨? But wait, we know that 🥴=e. So that can't be. Because 🥴 is already e. So the e in \"gether\" is from 🥴, which is e. So \"g e t h e r\" is \"g 🥴 🐮 🥳 🥴 r\". So \"g\" (letter g) + 🥴 (e) + 🐮 + 🥳 + 🥴 (e) + r. So \"g e 🐮 🥳 e r\". If that's \"gether\", then \"g e t h e r\" → \"g e t h e r\". So \"🐮\" would be t, \"🥳\" would be h. So 🐮=t, 🥳=h. That makes sense. Let's note that: 🐮=t, 🥳=h.\n\nSo now, replacing 🐮=t and 🥳=h, and 🥴=e, let's rewrite parts of the sentence:\n\nFirst part: 🐱🐯t🐨g e t h e r, → \"🐱🐯t🐨gether,\". Maybe \"Together,\" where T is 🐱, o is 🐯, g is t? No, t is 🐮. Let's think. \"Together\" is T o g e t h e r. So letters: T, o, g, e, t, h, e, r. So in the encoded part, the letters are:\n\n1: 🐱 → T?\n\n2: 🐯 → o?\n\n3: t (since 🐮=t) → g? Because \"Together\" has 'g' as the third letter. So \"Together\" would be T (🐱) o (🐯) g (maybe another emoji, but here position 3 is 🐮=t. So perhaps not \"Together\". Let's look at other parts.\n\nNext part: \"t h e 🐭🐨ns t e 🐯🐯🐱t i 🐨n\". So \"the 🐭🐨ns t e 🐯🐯🐱t i 🐨n\". Let's split into words. \"the\" is a common word. Then \"🐭🐨ns\" could be \"plans\" (if 🐭=p, 🐨=l). Let's see: \"plans\" is p l a n s. So \"🐭🐨ns\" would be p l a n s → if 🐭=p, 🐨=l. Then \"t e 🐯🐯🐱t\" would be \"t e ?? t\". If \"t e a c h t\" (but not sure). Alternatively, \"t e a m t\"? Maybe \"t e a m t\" isn't right. Let's check \"t e 🐯🐯🐱t i 🐨n\". Suppose \"t e a m t i o n\" → \"teamtion\"? No. Maybe \"t e a c h i n g\"? No. Alternatively, \"the plans t e ...\". Let's think of \"the plans to...\" Maybe \"the plans to\". But \"t e\" would be \"te\".\n\nAnother part: \"🐭🐨n t 🐱ins\" → \"🐭🐨n t 🐱ins\". If \"🐭=p, 🐨=l\", then \"pln t 🐱ins\". \"Plant\" something? \"Plant\" is p l a n t. So \"pln t\" could be \"plant\" if 🐨=a? Wait, earlier I thought 🐨=l, but maybe not. Let's try \"🐨=a\". Then \"🐭🐨ns\" would be \"🐭a ns\". \"ans\" is a word, but maybe \"plans\" (p l a n s) → if 🐭=p, 🐨=l. Then \"🐭🐨ns\"=plans. Then \"t e 🐯🐯🐱t i 🐨n\" would be \"te 🐯🐯🐱t i l n\" (if 🐨=l). \"tiln\" isn't a word. Alternatively, \"the plans test...\" \"test\" is t e s t. But \"t e 🐯🐯🐱t\" → \"t e s s t\" (if 🐯=s, 🐱=s). But that would be \"tess t\". Not helpful.\n\nLooking at \"50 g🐱🐯🐱xi e s\". \"50 g\" is \"50 g\". Then \"g🐱🐯🐱xi e s\" → \"g??xies\". Maybe \"giraffes\"? No, \"giraffes\" is g i r a f f e s. \"g??xies\" → \"g l a x i e s\"? \"Glaciers\"? \"Glaciers\" is g l a c i e r s. But \"g🐱🐯🐱xi e s\" → \"g 🐱 🐯 🐱 x i e s\". \"g l a c i e s\" would be \"glacies\" (plural of glacier). So \"glacies\" is g l a c i e s. So \"g 🐱 🐯 🐱 x i e s\" → \"g l a c x i e s\". Hmm, maybe \"g l a c i e s\" → \"g l a c i e s\" → so \"x\" is a typo or maybe not. Alternatively, \"g o a l i e s\" → \"goalies\". \"goalies\" is g o a l i e s. So \"g🐱🐯🐱xi e s\" → \"g o a l x i e s\". Maybe \"x\" is a typo, or perhaps it's \"g o a l i e s\" → \"goalies\". So \"g o a l i e s\" would be \"g 🐱 🐯 🐱 i e s\" (if x is a mistake). Then 🐱=o, 🐯=a, 🐱=l? No, each emoji is unique. So 🐱 must be one letter. Let's try 🐱=o, then \"g o 🐯 o x i e s\". \"g o a o x i e s\" → \"goao xies\"? Not helpful.\n\nAnother part: \"🐨🥺s e r🤩🐱🥺🐯 e\". \"🐨🥺s e r\" → \"🐨🥺ser\". Maybe \"master\" (m a s t e r). But \"e r\" is \"er\". \"🐨🥺s e r\" → \"??ser\". \"Dresser\"? No. \"Monster\"? \"m o n s t e r\" → \"mons ter\". Maybe \"🐨=m, 🥺=o\" → \"mo s e r\" → \"moser\"? Not a common word. \n\nLooking at \"t h r🐨ug h\". The part \"t h r🐨ug h\" (from \"🐮🥳r🐨ug🥳\" → t h r 🐨 u g h). \"through\" is t h r o u g h. So \"through\" would be t h r o u g h. So \"🐨=o\". That's a good lead! Let's check: \"t h r o u g h\" → t (🐮) h (🥳) r 🐨 (o) u g h (🥳=h). Yes! So \"🐮🥳r🐨ug🥳\" → t h r o u g h. Perfect! So that gives us 🐨=o. Because \"through\" is t h r o u g h. So:\n\n🐮=t (from before), 🥳=h (from before), 🐨=o. Then \"🐮🥳r🐨ug🥳\" is t h r o u g h. Yes! That fits. Great. So 🐨=o.\n\nNow let's update the known mappings: 🥴=e, 🐮=t, 🥳=h, 🐨=o.\n\nLet's rewrite the sentence with these:\n\nEncoded Sentence (after replacements):\n\nOriginal: 🐱🐯t o g e t h e r, t h e 🐭o n s t e 🐯🐯🐱t i o n 🐭o n t 🐱i n s 🐱🥺o u t 50 g🐱🐯🐱x i e s o 🥺s e r🤩🐱🥺🐯 e t h r o u g h 🐱🦆🐱t e u r t e 🐯 e s🐭o p e.\n\nLet's break this down word by word, adding spaces where possible (assuming the original has spaces, but the input might not; we'll have to infer):\n\n1. 🐱🐯t o g e t h e r, → \"??tog ether,\" → Maybe \"Together,\". \"Together\" is T o g e t h e r. So \"T o g e t h e r\" would be T (🐱) o (🐯) g (t?) No, t is 🐮. Wait, \"Together\" letters: T (1), o (2), g (3), e (4), t (5), h (6), e (7), r (8). So in the encoded part, the first part is 🐱 (1), 🐯 (2), t (3, 🐮=t), o (4, 🐨=o), g (5, letter g), e (6, 🥴=e), t (7, 🐮=t), h (8, 🥳=h), e (9, 🥴=e), r (10), comma. So \"🐱🐯t o g e t h e r,\" → letters 1: 🐱, 2: 🐯, 3: t, 4: o, 5: g, 6: e, 7: t, 8: h, 9: e, 10: r. So \"🐱🐯tog ether,\". If \"Together,\" is the word, then \"T o g e t h e r\" → T (🐱), o (🐯), g (letter g), e (🥴=e), t (🐮=t), h (🥳=h), e (🥴=e), r. Oh! The \"g\" here is a letter, not an emoji. So the first part is \"🐱🐯t o g e t h e r,\" → the letters are: 🐱, 🐯, t, o, g, e, t, h, e, r. So \"🐱🐯tog ether,\". Maybe \"Together,\" where \"T\" is 🐱 and \"o\" is 🐯. So \"T o t o g e t h e r\"? No. Alternatively, \"Catdogether,\"? No. Let's move to other parts.\n\nNext part: \"t h e 🐭o n s t e 🐯🐯🐱t i o n\". \"the 🐭o n s t e ??t i o n\". \"the component\" → \"the component\". \"component\" is c o m p o n e n t. No. \"the connection\" → \"the connection\". \"connection\" is c o n n e c t i o n. Let's see: \"t e 🐯🐯🐱t i o n\" → \"t e ??t i o n\". \"connection\" has \"necti\" → \"n e c t i o n\". So \"t e c t i o n\" → \"tection\". \"Detection\" → \"detection\" is d e t e c t i o n. \"the detection\" → \"the detection\". Let's check: \"the detection\" → \"the d e t e c t i o n\". So \"t h e d e t e c t i o n\". So \"🐭o n s t e 🐯🐯🐱t i o n\" → \"d o n s t e c c t i o n\"? No. Alternatively, \"the operation\". \"operation\" is o p e r a t i o n. \"the operation\" → \"the o p e r a t i o n\". \"t h e o p e r a t i o n\" → \"t h e o p e r a t i o n\". So \"🐭o n s t e 🐯🐯🐱t i o n\" → \"o p e r a t i o n\" would need \"🐭=p\". Let's try: \"the p o n s t e ...\" → \"the pons te...\" \"Pons\" is a part of the brain, but not sure. \n\nAnother part: \"🐭o n t 🐱i n s\" → \"🐭o n t 🐱i n s\". If \"🐭=p\", then \"p o n t 🐱i n s\" → \"point ??ins\". \"point\" is p o i n t. So maybe \"point lines\" → \"point lines\" → \"p o i n t l i n e s\". But \"🐱i n s\" would be \"l i n s\" (if 🐱=l). \"lines\" is l i n e s. So \"l i n s\" is missing the 'e'. Alternatively, \"point signs\" → \"p o i n t s i g n s\". No. \n\nNext: \"🐱🥺o u t\" → \"🐱🥺o u t\". \"about\" is a b o u t. So \"a b o u t\" → if 🐱=a, 🥺=b. Then \"a b o u t\" → \"about\". That's a good fit! Let's check: \"🐱🥺o u t\" → a b o u t → \"about\". So 🐱=a, 🥺=b. Let's note that: 🐱=a, 🥺=b.\n\nNow updating: 🥴=e, 🐮=t, 🥳=h, 🐨=o, 🐱=a, 🥺=b.\n\nRewriting the sentence with these:\n\nEncoded Sentence:\n\n1. a 🐯 t o g e t h e r, → \"a 🐯 t o g e t h e r,\" → Maybe \"a tiger together,\"? No. Let's proceed.\n\n2. t h e 🐭 o n s t e 🐯 🐯 a t i o n → \"the 🐭 o n s t e 🐯 🐯 a t i o n\"\n\n3. 🐭 o n t a i n s → \"🐭 o n t a i n s\" (since \"🐱i n s\" is a i n s → \"ains\" if 🐱=a. \"🐭 o n t a i n s\" → \"contains\"? \"contains\" is c o n t a i n s. Oh! \"contains\" is c o n t a i n s. So \"🐭 o n t a i n s\" → \"c o n t a i n s\" → so 🐭=c. That's perfect! So 🐭=c.\n\nSo now 🐭=c. Let's update:\n\nEncoded part 3: \"c o n t a i n s\" → correct, that's \"contains\". Great!\n\nPart 2: \"t h e c o n s t e 🐯 🐯 a t i o n\" → \"the conste??ation\". \"constellation\" is c o n s t e l l a t i o n. Yes! \"constellation\" → c o n s t e l l a t i o n. So \"the constellation\". So \"t h e c o n s t e l l a t i o n\". So \"🐯 🐯\" would be \"l l\" (since \"ll\" is in \"constellation\" after \"e\"). So 🐯=l. Because \"ll\" would be 🐯🐯 if 🐯=l. Let's check: \"e 🐯🐯 a t i o n\" → e l l a t i o n → \"ellation\". \"constellation\" is c o n s t e l l a t i o n → \"conste\" + \"llation\". So yes! So 🐯=l.\n\nNow we have 🐯=l. Let's update all mappings:\n\n🥴=e, 🐮=t, 🥳=h, 🐨=o, 🐱=a, 🥺=b, 🐭=c, 🐯=l.\n\nLet's rewrite the entire sentence with these:\n\nEncoded Sentence:\n\nOriginal: 🐱🐯🐮🐨g🥴🐮🥳🥴r, 🐮🥳🥴 🐭🐨ns🐮🥴🐯🐯🐱🐮i🐨n 🐭🐨n🐮🐱ins 🐱🥺🐨u🐮 50 g🐱🐯🐱xi🥴s 🐨🥺s🥴r🤩🐱🥺🐯🥴 🐮🥳r🐨ug🥳 🐱🦆🐱🐮🥴ur 🐮🥴🐯🥴s🐭🐨p🥴.\n\nReplace each emoji:\n\n🐱=a, 🐯=l, 🐮=t, 🐨=o, 🥴=e, 🥳=h, 🐭=c, 🥺=b.\n\nSo:\n\na l t o g e t h e r, t h e c o n s t e l l a t i o n c o n t a i n s a b o u t 50 g a l a x i e s o b s e r🤩a b l e t h r o u g h a 🦆a t e u r t e l e s c o p e.\n\nLet's check each part:\n\n1. a l t o g e t h e r, → \"altogether,\". That's a real word. Perfect! \"Altogether,\" makes sense.\n\n2. t h e c o n s t e l l a t i o n → \"the constellation\". Correct.\n\n3. c o n t a i n s → \"contains\". Correct.\n\n4. a b o u t → \"about\". Correct.\n\n5. 50 g a l a x i e s → \"50 galaxies\". Yes! \"galaxies\" is g a l a x i e s. Perfect.\n\n6. o b s e r🤩a b l e → \"observable\". The \"r🤩a\" part would be \"r a\" if 🤩=a, but \"observable\" is o b s e r v a b l e. Oh! \"observable\" is o b s e r v a b l e. So \"r🤩a\" is \"r v a\". So \"o b s e r v a b l e\". So \"🤩=v\". Let's check: \"o b s e r v a b l e\" → o (🐨=o), b (🥺=b), s (letter s), e (🥴=e), r (letter r), v (🤩=v), a (🐱=a), b (🥺=b), l (🐯=l), e (🥴=e). So \"o b s e r v a b l e\" → \"observable\". That works. So 🤩=v.\n\n7. t h r o u g h → \"through\". Correct (from earlier).\n\n8. a 🦆a t e u r → \"a 🦆ate ur\". \"telescope\" is t e l e s c o p e. Let's look at the next part: \"t e l e s c o p e\". The last part: \"t e l e s c o p e\" (from \"🐮🥴🐯🥴s🐭🐨p🥴\" → t e l e s c o p e). Let's check:\n\n\"🐮🥴🐯🥴s🐭🐨p🥴\" → t e l e s c o p e. Yes! \"t e l e s c o p e\" → t (🐮=t), e (🥴=e), l (🐯=l), e (🥴=e), s (letter s), c (🐭=c), o (🐨=o), p (letter p), e (🥴=e). So \"telescope\". Perfect. So that part is \"telescope\".\n\nNow back to \"a 🦆a t e u r\". \"telescope\" is part of the sentence. The previous part: \"a 🦆a t e u r\" → \"a ??ate ur\". Maybe \"a telescope ur\"? No. Let's look at \"a 🦆a t e u r\". \"a lensate ur\"? Not. \"a lens through\" → \"a lens through\". \"lens\" is l e n s. But \"a 🦆a t e u r\" → \"a ??ate ur\". Alternatively, \"a laser ur\"? No. Let's check the part before \"through\": \"a 🦆a t e u r t h r o u g h a ... telescope\". Maybe \"a laser through a telescope\". \"laser\" is l a s e r. So \"a l a s e r\" → \"a 🦆a t e u r\" would need \"🦆=s\". Because \"laser\" is l a s e r. So \"a s a t e u r\"? No. Alternatively, \"a device through a telescope\". \"device\" is d e v i c e. Not matching. \n\nAlternatively, \"a lens through a telescope\". \"lens\" is l e n s. So \"a l e n s\" → \"a l e n s\" → \"a 🐯 e n s\" (since 🐯=l). But \"a 🐯 e n s\" would be \"a l e n s\" → \"alens\". No, \"lens\" is l e n s. \n\nLet's look at \"a 🦆a t e u r\". The letters here are a, 🦆, a, t, e, u, r. Maybe \"a camera ur\"? \"camera\" is c a m e r a. No. \"a factor ur\"? \"factor\" is f a c t o r. No. Alternatively, \"a filter ur\"? Not. Let's leave that for now. Let's check other parts.\n\nThe sentence now: \"Altogether, the constellation contains about 50 galaxies observable through a 🦆ate ur telescope.\"\n\nWe need to figure out 🦆. Let's see the part \"a 🦆a t e u r\". \"a 🦆ate ur\" → \"a ??ate ur\". Maybe \"a plate ur\"? No. \"a crate ur\"? No. \"a state ur\"? \"state\" is s t a t e. \"a state ur\" → \"a state ur\". Not helpful. Alternatively, \"a satellite ur\". \"satellite\" is s a t e l l i t e. No. \n\nAlternatively, \"a lens through a telescope\" → \"a lens through a telescope\". \"lens\" is l e n s. So \"a l e n s\" → \"a l e n s\" → \"a 🐯 e n s\" (since 🐯=l). Which would be \"a l e n s\" → \"alens\" (no space), but \"a lens\" is correct. So maybe that part is \"a lens through a telescope\". So \"a l e n s\" → \"a l e n s\" → \"a 🐯 e n s\" (since 🐯=l). So \"a l e n s\" → \"alens\". But in the encoded sentence, it's \"a 🦆a t e u r\". Maybe I'm missing something. Let's check the remaining emojis. The emojis used so far are: 🐱, 🐯, 🐮, 🐨, 🥴, 🥳, 🐭, 🥺, 🤩. The remaining emoji is 🦆. We need to find what 🦆 represents.\n\nLooking at the part \"a 🦆a t e u r\". Let's see if \"a 🦆a t e u r\" is \"a laser\". \"laser\" is l a s e r. \"a l a s e r\" → \"a l a s e r\". So \"a 🐯 a 🦆 e r\" → since 🐯=l, \"a l a 🦆 e r\". So \"laser\" would be \"a l a s e r\", so 🦆=s. So \"a l a s e r\" → \"a 🐯 a 🦆 e r\" → yes! So 🦆=s. Then \"a 🦆a t e u r\" → \"a s a t e u r\". Hmm, \"a s a t e u r\" doesn't make sense. Alternatively, \"a lens\" → \"a l e n s\" → \"a 🐯 e n s\" (🐯=l). So \"a l e n s\" → \"alens\". Maybe the space is missing. Let's proceed.\n\nWe have most of the sentence decoded now. Let's list all the emojis and their letters:\n\n🐱=a, 🐯=l, 🐮=t, 🐨=o, 🥴=e, 🥳=h, 🐭=c, 🥺=b, 🤩=v, 🦆=s (maybe). Let's verify all parts:\n\n- \"Altogether,\" → a l t o g e t h e r, → correct.\n- \"the constellation\" → t h e c o n s t e l l a t i o n → correct (constellation has 'll' which is 🐯🐯=l l).\n- \"contains\" → c o n t a i n s → correct.\n- \"about\" → a b o u t → correct.\n- \"50 galaxies\" → 50 g a l a x i e s → correct (galaxies is g a l a x i e s).\n- \"observable\" → o b s e r v a b l e → correct (🤩=v).\n- \"through\" → t h r o u g h → correct.\n- \"telescope\" → t e l e s c o p e → correct.\n\nThe only remaining emoji is 🦆, which we need to figure out. Let's look at \"a 🦆a t e u r\". If \"a 🦆a t e u r\" is part of the sentence, maybe \"a s a t e u r\" is \"a satellite ur\" but that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's \"a lens through a telescope\". \"lens\" is l e n s → \"l e n s\" → \"l (🐯=l) e (🥴=e) n (letter n) s (letter s)\". So \"lens\" would be \"lens\", which is in \"contains\" as \"contains\" has 's' as a letter. So perhaps \"a lens through a telescope\" → \"a lens through a telescope\". The encoded part is \"a 🦆a t e u r\" → maybe \"a lens\" is \"a l e n s\" → \"a 🐯 e n s\" (since 🐯=l). So \"a l e n s\" → \"alens\" (without space). That could be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"a 🦆a t e u r\" is \"a laser\" → \"a l a s e r\" → \"a 🐯 a 🦆 e r\" (since 🐯=l). So \"a l a s e r\" → \"a l a s e r\" → so 🦆=s. That would make sense. Let's assume 🦆=s. Then \"a 🦆a t e u r\" → \"a s a t e u r\" → maybe a typo or a less common term, but given that the rest fits, we can proceed.\n\nSo the final mappings are:\n\n🐱=a, 🐯=l, 🐮=t, 🐨=o, 🥴=e (given), 🥳=h, 🐭=c, 🥺=b, 🤩=v, 🦆=s.\n\n🐱=a, 🐯=l, 🐮=t, 🐨=o, 🥴=e, 🥳=h, 🐭=c, 🥺=b, 🤩=v, 🦆=s\nAnswer: 🐱=a,🐯=l,🐮=t,🐨=o,🥴=e,🥳=h,🐭=c,🥺=b,🤩=v,🦆=s","Okay, let's try to solve this. First, let's list out all the emojis and their current guessed letters based on the history. The first attempt had some correct guesses. The feedback says that 🐱=a (correct), 🐯=l (correct), 🐮=t (correct), 🐨=o (correct), 🥴=e (correct, which was the hint), 🥳=h (correct), 🐭=c (correct), 🥺=b (correct), 🤩=v (correct), and 🦆=s (incorrect). So we need to fix 🦆.\n\nNow, let's substitute the known emojis into the encoded sentence. Let's go step by step.\n\nOriginal encoded sentence:\n🐱🐯🐮🐨g🥴🐮🥳🥴r, 🐮🥳🥴 🐭🐨ns🐮🥴🐯🐯🐱🐮i🐨n 🐭🐨n🐮🐱ins 🐱🥺🐨u🐮 50 g🐱🐯🐱xi🥴s 🐨🥺s🥴r🤩🐱🥺🐯🥴 🐮🥳r🐨ug🥳 🐱🦆🐱🐮🥴ur 🐮🥴🐯🥴s🐭🐨p🥴.\n\nSubstituting known emojis (replace each emoji with their letter):\n🐱=a, 🐯=l, 🐮=t, 🐨=o, 🥴=e, 🥳=h, 🐭=c, 🥺=b, 🤩=v, 🦆=?\n\nSo replacing:\na l t o g e t h e r, t h e c o n s t e l l a t i o n c o n t a i n s a b o u t 50 g a l a x i e s o b s e r v e a b l e t h r o u g h t e l e s c o p e. t h r o u g h a ? a t e u r t e l e s c o p e.\n\nWait, let's do this more carefully, breaking down the sentence into parts. Let's split the sentence by spaces and punctuation:\n\n1. 🐱🐯🐮🐨g🥴🐮🥳🥴r → a l t o g e t h e r\n2. , → comma\n3. 🐮🥳🥴 → t h e\n4. 🐭🐨ns🐮🥴🐯🐯🐱🐮i🐨n → c o n s t e l l a t i o n\n5. 🐭🐨n🐮🐱ins → c o n t a i n s\n6. 🐱🥺🐨u🐮 → a b o u t\n7. 50 g🐱🐯🐱xi🥴s → 50 g a l a x i e s\n8. 🐨🥺s🥴r🤩🐱🥺🐯🥴 → o b s e r v e a b l e\n9. 🐮🥳r🐨ug🥳 → t h r o u g h\n10. 🐱🦆🐱🐮🥴ur → a ? a t e u r\n11. 🐮🥴🐯🥴s🐭🐨p🥴 → t e l e s c o p e.\n\nLet's check each part:\n\n1. \"al t o g e t h e r\" → \"altogether\" (correct, since \"altogether\" is a word. The first part is 🐱🐯🐮🐨 = a l t o → \"alto\"? Wait, but \"alto\" is a word, but here it's part of \"altogether\". Let's see: the first part is 🐱🐯🐮🐨g🥴🐮🥳🥴r → a l t o g e t h e r. So \"altogether\" (a l t o g e t h e r) → that makes sense. So \"alto\" is the first four letters, then \"g\", then \"e\", \"t\", \"h\", \"e\", \"r\" → \"altogether\". That fits.\n\n2. \"t h e\" → \"the\" (correct, part 3: 🐮🥳🥴 = t h e → \"the\").\n\n3. Part 4: 🐭🐨ns🐮🥴🐯🐯🐱🐮i🐨n → c o n s t e l l a t i o n. Let's check: c o (🐭=c, 🐨=o) → \"co\", then \"ns\" (from the encoded \"ns\"), then 🐮=t, 🥴=e, 🐯=l (twice: 🐯🐯=ll), 🐱=a, 🐮=t, i, 🐨=o, n → \"nstella tion\"? Wait, \"constellation\" is spelled c-o-n-s-t-e-l-l-a-t-i-o-n. Let's map:\n\nc (🐭) o (🐨) n s t (🐮) e (🥴) l (🐯) l (🐯) a (🐱) t (🐮) i o (🐨) n → \"constellation\" → yes! Perfect. So part 4 is \"constellation\".\n\n4. Part 5: 🐭🐨n🐮🐱ins → c o n t a i n s. \"c o n t a i n s\" → \"contains\" (correct, because c o (🐭=c, 🐨=o) n t (🐮=t) a (🐱=a) i n s → \"contains\".\n\n5. Part 6: 🐱🥺🐨u🐮 → a b o u t. \"a b o u t\" → \"about\" (correct: a (🐱) b (🥺) o (🐨) u t (🐮) → \"about\".\n\n6. Part 7: 50 g🐱🐯🐱xi🥴s → 50 g a l a x i e s. \"g a l a x i e s\" → \"galaxies\" (g a (🐱) l (🐯) a (🐱) x i e (🥴) s → \"galaxies\". Correct.\n\n7. Part 8: 🐨🥺s🥴r🤩🐱🥺🐯🥴 → o b s e r v e a b l e. Let's break it down: o (🐨) b (🥺) s e (🥴) r v (🤩) a (🐱) b (🥺) l (🐯) e (🥴) → \"observeable\"? Wait, \"observable\" is o-b-s-e-r-v-a-b-l-e. Yes! So \"observable\" (o b s e r v e a b l e). Correct.\n\n8. Part 9: 🐮🥳r🐨ug🥳 → t h r o u g h. \"t h r o u g h\" → t (🐮) h (🥳) r o (🐨) u g h (🥳) → \"through\". Correct.\n\n9. Part 10: 🐱🦆🐱🐮🥴ur → a ? a t e u r. Let's look at \"a ? a t e u r\". The word here is likely \"telescope\" related, but let's see. The previous parts mention \"50 galaxies observable through ...\". The next part is \"through a ? a t e u r telescope\". The word \"telescope\" is in part 11: 🐮🥴🐯🥴s🐭🐨p🥴 → t e l e s c o p e (t (🐮) e (🥴) l (🐯) e (🥴) s (🐭=c? Wait, no. Wait, part 11: 🐮🥴🐯🥴s🐭🐨p🥴 → t e l e s c o p e. Let's check: t (🐮) e (🥴) l (🐯) e (🥴) s (s) c (🐭) o (🐨) p (p) e (🥴). So \"telescope\" (t-e-l-e-s-c-o-p-e). That fits. So part 11 is \"telescope.\" (with a period).\n\nBack to part 10: \"a ? a t e u r\". Let's think. The phrase could be \"a [something]ateur telescope\". Oh, \"amateur\"! \"Amateur\" is a-m-a-t-e-u-r. Let's check: a (🐱) m (?) a (🐱) t (🐮) e (🥴) u r. So \"amateur\" would fit. So the missing emoji here is 🦆, which is in the position of \"m\". So 🐱🦆🐱🐮🥴ur → a m a t e u r → \"amateur\". That makes sense. So the word here is \"amateur\", so 🦆 should be \"m\".\n\nLet's confirm: part 10 is \"a 🦆 a t e u r\" → \"a m a t e u r\" → \"amateur\". Yes, that works. So the previous guess for 🦆 was \"s\" (which was wrong), and now we should correct it to \"m\".\n\nLet's check the entire sentence with this substitution:\n\nEncoded Sentence with substitutions:\n\n1. 🐱🐯🐮🐨g🥴🐮🥳🥴r → a l t o g e t h e r → \"altogether\"\n2. , → ,\n3. 🐮🥳🥴 → t h e → \"the\"\n4. 🐭🐨ns🐮🥴🐯🐯🐱🐮i🐨n → c o n s t e l l a t i o n → \"constellation\"\n5. 🐭🐨n🐮🐱ins → c o n t a i n s → \"contains\"\n6. 🐱🥺🐨u🐮 → a b o u t → \"about\"\n7. 50 g🐱🐯🐱xi🥴s → 50 g a l a x i e s → \"50 galaxies\"\n8. 🐨🥺s🥴r🤩🐱🥺🐯🥴 → o b s e r v e a b l e → \"observable\"\n9. 🐮🥳r🐨ug🥳 → t h r o u g h → \"through\"\n10. 🐱🦆🐱🐮🥴ur → a m a t e u r → \"amateur\"\n11. 🐮🥴🐯🥴s🐭🐨p🥴 → t e l e s c o p e. → \"telescope.\"\n\nPutting it all together: \"Altogether, the constellation contains about 50 galaxies observable through amateur telescope.\" That makes sense! The sentence is a bit missing a word maybe, but \"through amateur telescope\" is correct. Alternatively, maybe \"through an amateur telescope\", but since the original encoded sentence might not have the \"an\", it's okay. The key part is that 🦆=m fits here.\n\nSo the only incorrect emoji from the first guess was 🦆, which we now correct to m. All other emojis were correct in the first attempt. So the answer should include all the correct ones plus the corrected 🦆=m.\n\nLet's analyze the encoded sentence using the known emoji-letter mappings from the history and correct the incorrect one. \n\n### Known Mappings (from History Feedback):\n- 🐱=a (correct)\n- 🐯=l (correct)\n- 🐮=t (correct)\n- 🐨=o (correct)\n- 🥴=e (correct, hint)\n- 🥳=h (correct)\n- 🐭=c (correct)\n- 🥺=b (correct)\n- 🤩=v (correct)\n- 🦆=s (incorrect, needs correction)\n\n### Substituting Known Mappings into the Encoded Sentence:\nThe encoded sentence becomes:  \n`a l t o g e t h e r, t h e c o n s t e l l a t i o n c o n t a i n s a b o u t 50 g a l a x i e s o b s e r v e a b l e t h r o u g h a ? a t e u r t e l e s c o p e.`  \n\n### Analyzing the Missing Emoji (🦆):\nThe phrase `a ? a t e u r` corresponds to \"amateur\" (a-m-a-t-e-u-r). Thus, the missing emoji 🦆 must map to \"m\".\n\n### Final Mappings:\nAll previously correct mappings are retained, and 🦆 is corrected to \"m\".\n\nAnswer: 🐱=a,🐯=l,🐮=t,🐨=o,🥴=e,🥳=h,🐭=c,🥺=b,🤩=v,🦆=m"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The encoded sentence is: \"f🐰🐶🤑 t🐭💩 🤗🐶🐰🤮 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt t🐭💩 t💩🐰🤑 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nc🥵 🙄🐵 🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮.\" The hint is that 💩=e. Also, there's no history yet, so we start fresh.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the emojis and their positions. Let's note the structure of the sentence. Words are separated by spaces. Let's split the encoded sentence into words:\n\n1. f🐰🐶🤑\n2. t🐭💩\n3. 🤗🐶🐰🤮\n4. 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt\n5. t🐭💩\n6. t💩🐰🤑\n7. 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nc🥵\n8. 🙄🐵\n9. 🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮\n\nFirst, the hint is 💩=e. Let's replace 💩 with e in all words.\n\n1. f🐰🐶🤑\n2. t🐭e (since t🐭💩 becomes t🐭e)\n3. 🤗🐶🐰🤮\n4. 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt\n5. t🐭e (same as word 2)\n6. te🐰🤑 (t💩🐰🤑 becomes te🐰🤑)\n7. 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nc🥵\n8. 🙄🐵\n9. 🤮e🐰🙄🤥e🤮 (since 🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮 becomes 🤮e🐰🙄🤥e🤮)\n\nLooking at word 2 and 5: t🐭e. Since they are the same, it's likely a common word. Let's think of 3-letter words starting with t and ending with e. Common ones: \"the\" (t-h-e). So if t🐭e is \"the\", then 🐭=h. Let's test that. So 🐭=h.\n\nSo word 2 and 5: t🐭e = the. So that's possible. Let's note 🐭=h.\n\nThen word 6: t💩🐰🤑 = te🐰🤑. Since t is t, e is e, so te🐰🤑 is a 4-letter word starting with te. Possible words: \"test\", \"tent\", \"term\", \"text\", \"tell\", etc. Let's see other words.\n\nWord 1: f🐰🐶🤑. Starts with f. 4 letters: f _ _ _. Maybe \"from\", \"fish\", \"five\", \"four\", etc.\n\nWord 3: 🤗🐶🐰🤮. 4 letters. Let's see the letters we have so far. Suppose we can find more patterns.\n\nWord 4: 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt. Let's break it down. Let's split into parts. Let's look at \"nt\" which is in the middle. \"nt\" is a common suffix (like \"ant\", \"ent\", \"int\", etc.) or part of a word. The word has \"😂cc🐶🧐nt\" followed by \"😂nt\". Let's see the structure: [emoji]cc[emoji][emoji]nt[emoji]nt. Maybe the word is something like \"accountant\" (but let's check). Accountant is a long word. Let's see: \"accountant\" has \"ac\", \"cc\", \"oun\", \"t\", etc. Let's see:\n\nIf 😂 is a, then \"😂cc\" would be \"acc\". That's possible. So 😂=a. Then \"😂cc\" is \"acc\". Then \"🐶\" could be o (since \"acco\" would be part of \"account\"). Let's check: \"acc\" + \"o\" (if 🐶=o) would be \"acco\". Then \"🧐\" could be u (so \"account\" would be \"accou\" + \"nt\"). Let's see: \"😂cc🐶🧐nt\" would be \"accou\" + \"nt\" → \"account\". Then \"😂nt\" would be \"ant\" (if 😂=a, then a + nt → \"ant\"). So \"accountant\" is \"account\" + \"ant\"? Wait, \"accountant\" is spelled a-c-c-o-u-n-t-a-n-t. Let's check:\n\na c c o u n t a n t → that's 11 letters. Let's count the letters in word 4: 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt. Let's count the characters:\n\n😂 (1) c (2) c (3) 🐶 (4) 🧐 (5) n (6) t (7) 😂 (8) n (9) t (10). So 10 characters. \"accountant\" is 11 letters. Hmm, maybe \"accomptant\"? No, not a word. Alternatively, maybe \"accommodant\"? No. Let's think again.\n\nAlternatively, the word could be \"accentant\"? No. Let's think of other possibilities. Let's see, \"😂cc\" is \"acc\" (if 😂=a). Then \"🐶\" is next. Let's say \"🐶\" is a letter. Let's look at word 1: f🐰🐶🤑. If word 1 is \"from\", then \"f r o m\". So f🐰🐶🤑 would be f (f) 🐰 (r) 🐶 (o) 🤑 (m). That's possible. So if 🐰=r, 🐶=o, 🤑=m. Let's check that.\n\nSo word 1: f🐰🐶🤑 → f r o m → \"from\". That's a good candidate. Let's note 🐰=r, 🐶=o, 🤑=m.\n\nThen word 6: t💩🐰🤑 → t e r m → \"term\". That works. So \"term\" is a 4-letter word starting with te, which fits. So that's possible.\n\nWord 2: t🐭e → t h e → \"the\" (since 🐭=h). That's correct. So word 2 and 5 are \"the\".\n\nWord 3: 🤗🐶🐰🤮 → 🤗 o r 🤮. Let's see, 4 letters. If \"🤗 o r 🤮\" is a word, maybe \"your\" (y o u r). Wait, \"your\" is y-o-u-r. So if 🤗=y, and 🤮=u. Let's check: 🤗=y, 🐶=o, 🐰=r, 🤮=u. Then word 3: y o r u? No, that's \"yoru\" which isn't English. Alternatively, \"four\" (f-o-u-r), but word 1 is \"from\", so f is already in word 1. Alternatively, \"poor\" (p-o-o-r) but that's p. Hmm. Let's think of 4-letter words with o and r. \"Door\" (d-o-o-r). But that's d. \"Bore\" (b-o-r-e). But word 3 ends with 🤮, so if \"bore\" then 🤮=e, but e is already 💩=e. No. Alternatively, \"core\" (c-o-r-e). So if 🤗=c, 🤮=e. But e is 💩. So that's possible. But let's check other words.\n\nWord 9: 🤮e🐰🙄🤥e🤮 → u e r 🙄 🤥 e u (if 🤮=u, 🐰=r, 💩=e). Let's see. The structure is [emoji] e r [emoji] [emoji] e [emoji]. Let's count the letters: 7 letters. Maybe \"underuse\"? u-n-d-e-r-u-s-e? No, that's longer. Or \"usereru\"? No. Alternatively, if 🤮 is another letter. Let's go back.\n\nWord 4: 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt. If 😂=a, then \"a c c o 🧐 n t a n t\". Let's see, \"accountant\" is a c c o u n t a n t. So \"acco\" + \"u\" (🧐=u) + \"nt\" → \"account\", then \"a\" (😂=a) + \"nt\" → \"ant\". So \"accountant\" is a c c o u n t a n t, which is 11 letters. But the word here is \"😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt\" which is 10 characters. Let's count: 😂 (1), c(2), c(3), 🐶(4), 🧐(5), n(6), t(7), 😂(8), n(9), t(10). So 10 letters. \"accountant\" is 11 letters, so maybe it's \"accountant\" missing a letter? No. Alternatively, \"accomptant\" (10 letters). A c c o m p t a n t. Let's check: \"😂cc\"=a c c, \"🐶\"=o, \"🧐\"=m, then \"pt\" (but where's p?), \"nt\"=n t. Then \"😂nt\"=a n t. So \"accomptant\" would be a c c o m p t a n t. That's 10 letters. But \"accomptant\" isn't a standard word. Maybe \"accentant\"? No. Alternatively, maybe the word is \"acquaintant\" (a c q u a i n t a n t). No, that's longer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"😂\" is not a. Let's think of other possibilities. Let's look at the \"cc\" in the word. \"cc\" is a common letter pair, like \"accent\", \"accommodate\", \"success\", \"access\", etc. So if \"cc\" is in the middle, maybe \"accent\" (a c c e n t). But in word 4, \"😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt\", the \"cc\" is after the first emoji. So \"a c c\" (if 😂=a) would be \"acc\".\n\nLet's go back to word 6: t💩🐰🤑 → t e 🐰 🤑. If this is \"term\", then 🐰=r, 🤑=m. Then word 1: f🐰🐶🤑 → f r 🐶 m. If that's \"from\", then 🐶=o. So \"from\" (f r o m). That fits. So 🐰=r, 🐶=o, 🤑=m.\n\nSo word 1: from.\n\nWord 6: term (t e r m).\n\nWord 2: t🐭e → t h e (if 🐭=h). That's \"the\".\n\nWord 5: t🐭e → the.\n\nNow, word 3: 🤗🐶🐰🤮 → 🤗 o r 🤮. Let's think of 4-letter words with o and r. Maybe \"your\" (y o u r). So if 🤗=y, 🤮=u. Then word 3: y o r u → \"your\"? That's possible. \"your\" is y-o-u-r, but the order here is 🤗(y) 🐶(o) 🐰(r) 🤮(u). Oh, that's y-o-r-u, which is \"yoru\" (Japanese for \"night\") but not English. Maybe \"poor\" (p-o-o-r). But that would need 🤗=p, 🐰=r, 🐶=o, 🤮=r. But 🐰 is already r, so 🤮 can't be r. Alternatively, \"core\" (c-o-r-e). But e is 💩. So \"core\" would be c-o-r-e. So 🤗=c, 🤮=e. But e is already taken by 💩. So maybe 🤮=e? Then word 3: c-o-r-e → \"core\". That's possible. So 🤗=c, 🤮=e. But wait, 💩=e. So that's okay, each emoji is unique, so if 💩 and 🤮 are different emojis, they can't both be e. Oh right, the problem states \"each letter with a unique emoji\", so each emoji maps to a unique letter, and each letter is represented by a unique emoji. So if 💩=e, then no other emoji can be e. So 🤮 can't be e. So \"core\" is out.\n\nAnother 4-letter word with o and r: \"bore\" (b-o-r-e). Again, e is taken. \"dore\" (d-o-r-e), same issue. \"fore\" (f-o-r-e). But word 1 is \"from\" (f-r-o-m), so \"fore\" would have f, o, r, e. But e is taken. \"gore\" (g-o-r-e), same. \"hore\" (h-o-r-e), but h is 🐭=h. So \"hore\" would be h-o-r-e. If word 3 is \"hore\", then 🤗=h, but 🐭=h, which can't be (unique). So that's not possible. \"mole\" (m-o-l-e), e again. \"note\" (n-o-t-e), e again. \"rope\" (r-o-p-e), e again. \"sore\" (s-o-r-e), e again. \"tore\" (t-o-r-e), e again. \"vole\" (v-o-l-e), e again. \"wore\" (w-o-r-e), e again. So maybe it's not a word ending with e.\n\nWhat about \"born\" (b-o-r-n). So if word 3 is \"born\", then 🤗=b, 🤮=n. Let's check. \"born\" is b-o-r-n. So 🤗=b, 🐶=o, 🐰=r, 🤮=n. That works. Let's keep that in mind.\n\nWord 4: 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt. Let's substitute the knowns. 🐶=o, so \"😂cc o 🧐 nt 😂 nt\". Let's see, if 😂=a, then \"acc o 🧐 nt a nt\". Let's think of a word with \"acco\". Maybe \"accountant\" as before, but let's count letters. \"accountant\" is a c c o u n t a n t (11 letters). The current word 4 has \"😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt\" which is 10 characters (😂, c, c, 🐶, 🧐, n, t, 😂, n, t). So 10 letters. \"accountant\" is 11, so maybe \"accompt\" (a c c o m p t) but that's 7 letters. Then \"a nt\" (a n t) → \"accomptant\" (10 letters). A c c o m p t a n t. Let's check: \"😂cc\"=a c c, \"🐶\"=o, \"🧐\"=m, \"p\" would be where? Oh, the structure here is \"😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt\". So \"a c c o m n t a n t\". That's \"accomntant\". Doesn't make sense. Maybe \"accentant\"? No.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at \"nt\" in the word. \"nt\" is a common ending. Let's see the word \"constant\" (c o n s t a n t). No, maybe \"inconstant\"? Not sure. Let's try another approach.\n\nWord 7: 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nc🥵. Let's substitute knowns. If 😂=a, 🐶=o, then \"a c c o 🧐 nt a nc 🥵\". Let's see, \"account\" (a c c o u n t) would be \"a c c o u n t\". So \"account\" is 7 letters. Then \"a nc\" → \"a n c\". Maybe \"accountancy\" (a c c o u n t a n c y). That's 11 letters. Let's check the length. Word 7: \"😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nc🥵\" has characters: 😂(1),c(2),c(3),🐶(4),🧐(5),n(6),t(7),😂(8),n(9),c(10),🥵(11). So 11 letters. \"accountancy\" is 11 letters: a c c o u n t a n c y. So let's map that:\n\n😂=a, c=c (since c is a letter in the encoded sentence, so the actual c is part of the code), 🐶=o, 🧐=u, 😂=a (again), n=n, c=c, 🥵=y. So \"accountancy\" would fit: a c c o u n t a n c y. Let's check:\n\n😂cc🐶🧐nt → a c c o u n t → \"account\"\n\n😂nc → a n c → \"anc\"\n\n🥵 → y. So \"accountancy\" (a c c o u n t a n c y). That works! So word 7 is \"accountancy\".\n\nSo that would mean:\n\n😂=a\n\n🐶=o\n\n🧐=u\n\n🥵=y\n\nThen, let's check word 4: 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt. Using the above mappings:\n\n😂=a, c=c, 🐶=o, 🧐=u, n=n, t=t. So \"a c c o u n t a n t\" → \"accountant\". That's 10 letters, which matches the word 4's length (😂,c,c,🐶,🧐,n,t,😂,n,t → 10 characters). Yes! \"accountant\" is a c c o u n t a n t (10 letters). Perfect! So word 4 is \"accountant\".\n\nSo now we have:\n\n😂=a\n\n🐶=o\n\n🧐=u\n\n🥵=y\n\nLet's confirm:\n\nWord 4: 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt → a c c o u n t a n t → \"accountant\". Correct.\n\nWord 7: 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nc🥵 → a c c o u n t a n c y → \"accountancy\". Correct.\n\nGreat, that's a solid lead.\n\nNow, word 6: t💩🐰🤑 → t e 🐰 🤑. We thought earlier it could be \"term\". If \"term\" is t e r m, then 🐰=r, 🤑=m. Let's check with word 1: f🐰🐶🤑 → f r o m → \"from\". Perfect! So that fits. So:\n\n🐰=r\n\n🤑=m\n\nWord 1: f🐰🐶🤑 → f r o m → \"from\". Correct.\n\nWord 6: t💩🐰🤑 → t e r m → \"term\". Correct.\n\nWord 2 and 5: t🐭💩 → t h e → \"the\". So 🐭=h.\n\nSo 🐭=h.\n\nWord 3: 🤗🐶🐰🤮 → 🤗 o r 🤮. Let's see. What's a 4-letter word that could fit here. Let's look at the rest of the sentence. The full encoded sentence with substitutions so far:\n\n1. from\n2. the\n3. 🤗or🤮\n4. accountant\n5. the\n6. term\n7. accountancy\n8. 🙄🐵\n9. 🤮e r 🙄🤥e🤮 → let's substitute knowns: 🤮 e r 🙄 🤥 e 🤮 (since 💩=e, 🐰=r).\n\nLet's look at word 9: \"🤮e r 🙄🤥e🤮\". Let's count letters: 7 letters. The structure is [letter] e r [letter] [letter] e [letter]. Let's think of possible words. Maybe \"underuse\" (u n d e r u s e). But that's 8 letters. \"Userers\" (u s e r e r s) no. \"Nervers\" (n e r v e r s) no. \"Lerpers\" (l e r p e r s) no. \"Berverb\" (no). Alternatively, \"herbary\" (h e r b a r y) → h e r b a r y (7 letters). But \"herbary\" is a place where herbs are grown. Let's see: \"h e r b a r y\" would be h (if 🤮=h) but h is 🐭=h, which can't be. Alternatively, \"mercery\" (m e r c e r y). No, that's 7 letters but structure is m e r c e r y. Let's see: \"🤮 e r 🙄 🤥 e 🤮\" → m e r c e r y. Then 🤮=m, 🙄=c, 🤥=e (but e is 💩=e, so no). Alternatively, \"tergum\" (t e r g u m) → 6 letters. No.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at word 8: 🙄🐵. It's a 2-letter word. Common 2-letter words: \"of\", \"in\", \"on\", \"at\", \"to\", \"is\", \"it\", \"he\", \"she\", \"we\", \"by\", \"be\", \"or\", \"an\", \"as\", \"if\", \"so\", \"up\", \"do\", \"ok\". Let's think of possible letters. Let's say 🙄=i, 🐵=t → \"it\". Or 🙄=b, 🐵=y → \"by\". Or 🙄=o, 🐵=f → \"of\". Let's see.\n\nWord 3: 🤗or🤮. Let's say it's \"your\" (y o u r). But we have 🐰=r, so \"your\" would be y o u r. But in word 3, the structure is 🤗 o r 🤮. So \"your\" would be y o r u (since 🐰=r, so the third character is r). That's \"yoru\" which isn't English. Alternatively, \"pour\" (p o u r). So 🤗=p, 🤮=u. Then word 3: p o r u → \"poru\"? No. \"bore\" (b o r e) but e is taken. \"core\" (c o r e), e taken. \"dore\" (d o r e), e taken. \"fore\" (f o r e), e taken. \"gore\" (g o r e), e taken. \"hore\" (h o r e), h is 🐭=h. \"more\" (m o r e), e taken. \"pore\" (p o r e), e taken. \"sore\" (s o r e), e taken. \"tore\" (t o r e), e taken. \"wore\" (w o r e), e taken. So maybe it's not a 4-letter word ending with e.\n\nWhat about \"horn\" (h o r n). But h is 🐭=h, so 🤗=h would conflict. \"corn\" (c o r n). So if 🤗=c, 🤮=n. Then word 3: c o r n → \"corn\". That's a valid word. Let's check that. So 🤗=c, 🤮=n.\n\nThen word 3: corn.\n\nWord 9: 🤮e r 🙄🤥e🤮 → n e r 🙄🤥e n. Let's see, \"nerve n\"? No. Let's think of a 7-letter word: \"nervure\" (n e r v u r e). That's 7 letters. \"n e r v u r e\" → n e r v u r e. So 🤮=n, 🙄=v, 🤥=u, and the last 🤮=n. Let's check: \"n e r v u r e\" → \"nervure\" (a vein in an insect's wing). That's a valid word. So:\n\n🤮=n\n\n🙄=v\n\n🤥=u\n\nThen word 9: n e r v u r e → \"nervure\".\n\nWord 8: 🙄🐵 → v 🐵. 2-letter word starting with v. \"ve\" (v e), \"vs\" (v s), \"vi\" (v i), \"vo\" (v o), \"vu\" (v u). Let's say it's \"vs\" (versus). So 🐵=s. Then word 8: vs.\n\nLet's check if that works. So 🐵=s.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nEncoded Sentence substitutions:\n\n1. f🐰🐶🤑 → f r o m → \"from\"\n\n2. t🐭💩 → t h e → \"the\"\n\n3. 🤗🐶🐰🤮 → c o r n → \"corn\"\n\n4. 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt → a c c o u n t a n t → \"accountant\"\n\n5. t🐭💩 → t h e → \"the\"\n\n6. t💩🐰🤑 → t e r m → \"term\"\n\n7. 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nc🥵 → a c c o u n t a n c y → \"accountancy\"\n\n8. 🙄🐵 → v s → \"vs\"\n\n9. 🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮 → n e r v u e n → Wait, \"n e r v u e n\" is 7 letters. Earlier I thought \"nervure\" is n e r v u r e (7 letters). Oh, but with our current substitutions, word 9 is 🤮(n) 💩(e) 🐰(r) 🙄(v) 🤥(u) 💩(e) 🤮(n) → n e r v u e n. That's 7 letters: n-e-r-v-u-e-n. \"Nervuen\" isn't a word. Hmm. Maybe my assumption about word 9 is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach for word 3: Let's think of \"four\" (f o u r). But word 1 is \"from\" (f r o m), so f is already there. \"four\" would be f o u r. But word 3's first emoji is 🤗, which would need to be f. But word 1 starts with f, which is a letter, not an emoji. Oh wait, the encoded sentence has \"f\" as a letter. Oh! Wait, the encoded sentence starts with \"f🐰🐶🤑\". So \"f\" is a letter, not an emoji. Oh, I missed that. So the sentence has a mix of letters and emojis. So \"f\" is a letter, not an emoji. So word 1 is \"f\" followed by emojis: f 🐰 🐶 🤑. So \"f\" is the first letter, then three emojis. So \"f\" is part of the encoded word, not an emoji. So that changes things.\n\nOh, that's a crucial point. The problem says \"each letter with a unique emoji\", but the encoded sentence may have letters as well. So in the encoded sentence, \"f\", \"t\", \"c\", \"n\", \"t\" (in \"😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt\"), etc., are actual letters, not emojis. So the emojis are the ones like 🐰, 🐶, etc. So the letters in the encoded sentence are part of the code, and the emojis are substitutions.\n\nSo let's re-express the encoded sentence with that in mind. The letters are: f, t, c, n, t, etc. So the emojis are: 🐰, 🐶, 🤑, 🐭, 💩, 🤗, 🤮, 😂, 🧐, 🙄, 🐵, 🥵, 🤥.\n\nThe hint is 💩=e. So 💩 is mapped to e.\n\nLet's re-express the words with letters and emojis:\n\n1. f 🐰 🐶 🤑 → letters: f, then emojis 🐰, 🐶, 🤑. So the word is f + (emoji1) + (emoji2) + (emoji3).\n\n2. t 🐭 💩 → t + 🐭 + 💩. Since 💩=e, this is t + 🐭 + e. So a 3-letter word: t _ e.\n\n3. 🤗 🐶 🐰 🤮 → four emojis: 🤗, 🐶, 🐰, 🤮.\n\n4. 😂 c c 🐶 🧐 n t 😂 n t → emojis: 😂, then letters c, c, emoji 🐶, emoji 🧐, letters n, t, emoji 😂, letters n, t. So the word is [😂] c c [🐶] [🧐] n t [😂] n t.\n\n5. t 🐭 💩 → same as word 2: t + 🐭 + e.\n\n6. t 💩 🐰 🤑 → t + e + 🐰 + 🤑 (since 💩=e). So t e _ _.\n\n7. 😂 c c 🐶 🧐 n t 😂 n c 🥵 → [😂] c c [🐶] [🧐] n t [😂] n c [🥵].\n\n8. 🙄 🐵 → two emojis: 🙄, 🐵.\n\n9. 🤮 💩 🐰 🙄 🤥 💩 🤮 → [🤮] e [🐰] [🙄] [🤥] e [🤮].\n\nOkay, now that's clearer. Let's start again.\n\nWord 2 and 5: t + 🐭 + e. 3-letter word: t _ e. Common words: the, tie, toe, tee, etc. Most common is \"the\" (t-h-e). So likely 🐭=h.\n\nWord 6: t + e + 🐰 + 🤑 → t e _ _. 4-letter words starting with te: term, test, tent, text, tell, etc.\n\nWord 4: [😂] c c [🐶] [🧐] n t [😂] n t. Let's look at \"cc\" which is a common letter pair. Words with \"cc\": accident, account, according, etc. Let's look at the structure: [X] c c [Y] [Z] n t [X] n t. Let's suppose X is 'a' (common letter). Then [a] c c [Y] [Z] n t [a] n t. So \"ac c Y Z nt a nt\". Let's think of \"accountant\". Let's check:\n\naccountant → a c c o u n t a n t. Let's map:\n\nX (😂) = a\n\nY (🐶) = o\n\nZ (🧐) = u\n\nThen \"a c c o u n t a n t\" → which matches the structure: [a] c c [o] [u] n t [a] n t. Perfect! So word 4 is \"accountant\".\n\nSo:\n\n😂=a\n\n🐶=o\n\n🧐=u\n\nWord 7: [😂] c c [🐶] [🧐] n t [😂] n c [🥵] → [a] c c [o] [u] n t [a] n c [🥵]. Let's see what word this could be. \"accountancy\" → a c c o u n t a n c y. That's 11 letters. Let's check:\n\na c c o u n t a n c y → [a] c c [o] [u] n t [a] n c [y]. So yes! So 🥵=y.\n\nWord 7 is \"accountancy\".\n\nSo 🥵=y.\n\nWord 1: f + 🐰 + 🐶 + 🤑 → f + [🐰] + o + [��]. So 4-letter word starting with f, with o as the third letter. Common words: from (f-r-o-m), form (f-o-r-m), etc. \"from\" is f-r-o-m. So if the word is \"from\", then:\n\n🐰=r (second letter)\n\n��=m (fourth letter)\n\nSo:\n\n🐰=r\n\n��=m\n\nWord 1: f + r + o + m → \"from\".\n\nWord 6: t + e + 🐰 + 🤑 → t + e + r + m → \"term\". Perfect.\n\nWord 3: [🤗] + [🐶] + [🐰] + [🤮] → [🤗] + o + r + [🤮]. 4-letter word with o and r. Common words: your (y-o-u-r), corn (c-o-r-n), born (b-o-r-n), etc. Let's think about the context of the sentence. The full sentence with substitutions so far:\n\n1. from\n\n2. the\n\n3. [🤗]or[🤮]\n\n4. accountant\n\n5. the\n\n6. term\n\n7. accountancy\n\n8. [🙄][🐵]\n\n9. [🤮]e r [🙄][🤥]e[🤮]\n\nLet's look at word 9: [🤮] e r [🙄][🤥] e [🤮]. 7 letters. Let's suppose it's \"nervure\" (n-e-r-v-u-r-e) but that's 7 letters. Let's check:\n\nn e r v u r e → [n] e r [v][u] e [n]. So if:\n\n🤮=n\n\n🙄=v\n\n🤥=u\n\nThen word 9: n e r v u e n → No, \"nervuen\" isn't a word. Alternatively, \"herbary\" (h-e-r-b-a-r-y) → h e r b a r y. So [h] e r [b][a] e [h]. But h is 🐭=h, so 🤮=h would conflict. Alternatively, \"merchant\" (m-e-r-c-h-a-n-t) → no, longer.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of word 3. If word 3 is \"your\" (y-o-u-r), then:\n\n🤗=y\n\n🤮=u\n\nSo word 3: y-o-r-u → \"yoru\" (not English). No. If word 3 is \"corn\" (c-o-r-n), then:\n\n🤗=c\n\n🤮=n\n\nWord 3: c-o-r-n → \"corn\". That's valid.\n\nWord 9: [n] e r [🙄][🤥] e [n]. Let's think of \"nerve n\"? No. Maybe \"nerve\" plus something. Alternatively, \"nerve\" is 5 letters. Let's see. \"nervous\" (n-e-r-v-o-u-s) → 7 letters. So n e r v o u s → [n] e r [v][o] u [s]. But we need the structure [n] e r [v][?] e [n]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at word 8: [🙄][🐵]. 2-letter word. Common ones: \"it\", \"is\", \"in\", \"on\", \"at\", \"to\", \"of\", \"by\", \"an\", \"as\", \"if\", \"so\", \"up\", \"do\", \"ok\", \"we\", \"he\", \"she\". Let's suppose it's \"by\" (b-y). So 🙄=b, 🐵=y. But 🥵=y, so 🐵 can't be y (unique). \"as\" (a-s). 😂=a, so 🙄=a would conflict. \"if\" (i-f). \"on\" (o-n). 🐶=o, so 🙄=o would conflict. \"at\" (a-t). 😂=a, conflict. \"to\" (t-o). \"it\" (i-t). \"we\" (w-e). 💩=e, so 🐵=e would conflict. \"he\" (h-e). 🐭=h, conflict. \"she\" (s-h-e). \"or\" (o-r). 🐶=o, 🐰=r, so \"or\" would be o-r. But word 8 is two emojis, so if 🙄=o and 🐵=r, but 🐶=o and 🐰=r, which are already mapped. So can't be. \"so\" (s-o). \"ok\" (o-k). \"vs\" (v-s). Let's say \"vs\" (versus). So 🙄=v, 🐵=s. That's possible.\n\nWord 8: vs.\n\nWord 9: [🤮] e r v [🤥] e [🤮]. Let's think of \"nervure\" again. n e r v u r e. So [n] e r v u r e. So if 🤮=n, 🤥=u, then word 9: n e r v u r e → \"nervure\". That's 7 letters. Yes! \"nervure\" is a valid word (a vein in an insect's wing or a rib in a leaf). So:\n\n🤮=n\n\n🤥=u\n\nThen word 9: n e r v u r e → \"nervure\".\n\nLet's check all mappings so far:\n\n💩=e (given)\n\n🐭=h (from \"the\")\n\n😂=a (from \"accountant\")\n\n🐶=o (from \"accountant\")\n\n🧐=u (from \"accountant\")\n\n🥵=y (from \"accountancy\")\n\n🐰=r (from \"from\")\n\n��=m (from \"from\")\n\n🤗=c (from \"corn\")\n\n🤮=n (from \"nervure\")\n\n🙄=v (from \"vs\")\n\n🐵=s (from \"vs\")\n\n🤥=u (from \"nervure\")\n\nWait, but 🧐=u and 🤥=u would be a conflict because each emoji must map to a unique letter. Oh, right! Each emoji has a unique letter. So if 🧐 is u, then 🤥 can't be u. That's a mistake. Let's correct that.\n\nIn word 4: 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt → accountant (a c c o u n t a n t). So 🧐=u.\n\nWord 9: [🤮] e r [🙄][🤥] e [🤮] → let's say it's \"nervure\" (n e r v u r e). So the letters are n e r v u r e. So the structure is:\n\n🤮=n\n\n💩=e (given)\n\n🐰=r\n\n🙄=v\n\n🤥=u\n\n💩=e\n\n🤮=n.\n\nBut 🧐=u and 🤥=u would mean two emojis (🧐 and 🤥) map to u, which is not allowed. So that's a conflict. So 🤥 can't be u. Let's find another letter for 🤥.\n\nLet's try \"nervous\" (n e r v o u s). No, that's 7 letters but structure doesn't fit. \"nerved\" (n e r v e d) is 6 letters. \"nerves\" (n e r v e s) is 6 letters. \"nerve\" (n e r v e) is 5 letters.\n\nAlternative word 9: \"heretic\" (h e r e t i c). No. \"merchant\" (m e r c h a n t) → 8 letters. \"terrain\" (t e r r a i n) → 7 letters. t e r r a i n → [t] e r [r][a] i [n]. But t is a letter, not an emoji. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of word 3 again. If word 3 is \"your\" (y-o-u-r), then:\n\n🤗=y\n\n🐶=o (already mapped)\n\n🐰=r (already mapped)\n\n🤮=u.\n\nSo word 3: y-o-r-u → \"yoru\" (not English), but maybe it's a name or a foreign word. Let's proceed.\n\nThen word 9: [u] e r [🙄][🤥] e [u]. Let's think of \"u e r ... e u\". Maybe \"usereru\" (no). \"u e r v e u\" → \"uerveu\" (nope).\n\nAlternatively, word 3 could be \"bore\" (b-o-r-e). But e is 💩=e, so 🤮=e. But emojis must be unique, so 🤮=e would conflict with 💩=e. Not allowed.\n\nAnother approach: Let's list all emojis and the letters we have so far:\n\nEmojis: 🐰, 🐶, 🤑, 🐭, 💩, 🤗, 🤮, 😂, 🧐, 🙄, 🐵, 🥵, 🤥.\n\nMapped so far:\n\n💩=e (given)\n\n🐭=h (from \"the\")\n\n😂=a (from \"accountant\")\n\n🐶=o (from \"accountant\")\n\n🧐=u (from \"accountant\")\n\n🥵=y (from \"accountancy\")\n\n🐰=r (from \"from\")\n\n��=m (from \"from\")\n\nRemaining emojis to map: 🤗, 🤮, 🙄, 🐵, 🤥.\n\nLetters used: a, e, h, m, o, r, u, y.\n\nAvailable letters: b, c, d, f, g, i, j, k, l, n, p, q, s, t, v, w, x, z.\n\nWord 3: 🤗, 🐶(o), 🐰(r), 🤮 → 4-letter word: [A] o r [B]. Possible words:\n\n- \"corn\" (c o r n) → A=c, B=n → letters c, n available.\n\n- \"born\" (b o r n) → A=b, B=n → letters b, n available.\n\n- \"porn\" (p o r n) → A=p, B=n → letters p, n available.\n\n- \"sorn\" (s o r n) → A=s, B=n → letters s, n available.\n\n- \"torn\" (t o r n) → A=t, B=n → letters t available (t is a letter in the encoded sentence, but can be an emoji mapping? Wait, the letters in the encoded sentence are part of the code, but emojis map to letters. So \"t\" is a letter, not an emoji, so an emoji can map to t. But \"torn\" would have A=t, which is possible.\n\nLet's take \"corn\" (c o r n). So:\n\n🤗=c\n\n🤮=n.\n\nLetters used now: a, c, e, h, m, n, o, r, u, y.\n\nWord 9: 🤮(n) 💩(e) 🐰(r) 🙄 🤥 💩(e) 🤮(n) → n e r [C] [D] e n. 7-letter word. Let's think of \"nervine\" (n e r v i n e). That's 7 letters: n e r v i n e. So:\n\n🙄=v\n\n🤥=i.\n\nSo word 9: n e r v i e n → \"nervien\"? No, \"nervine\" is n e r v i n e (7 letters). Oh, the structure is n e r v i e n → which is 7 letters, but \"nervine\" ends with e, not n. So close.\n\nAnother 7-letter word: \"nerveen\" (no). \"nereide\" (n e r e i d e) → no. \"nereids\" (n e r e i d s) → no. \"nereism\" (n e r e i s m) → no. \"nervate\" (n e r v a t e) → 7 letters. n e r v a t e. So:\n\nn e r v a t e → [n] e r [v][a] t [e]. But our structure is [n] e r [v][a] e [n]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, \"narcene\" (n a r c e n e) → no. \"narcein\" (n a r c e i n) → 7 letters. n a r c e i n. Structure: [n] a r c e i n. Not matching.\n\nLet's try \"nervure\" again, even with the conflict. If we made a mistake in 🧐=u. Let's recheck word 4: 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt. If 😂=a, then \"a c c o 🧐 n t a n t\". If \"accountant\" is a c c o u n t a n t, then 🧐=u. So that's correct. So 🧐=u. Then 🤥 can't be u. So let's think of another letter for 🤥.\n\nWord 9: n e r v [D] e n. Let's say D is s. So \"nervsen\" (no). D is d: \"nervden\" (no). D is l: \"nervlen\" (no). D is b: \"nervben\" (no). D is k: \"nervken\" (no).\n\nAlternatively, word 9 could be \"nerve n\", but that's not a word. Maybe it's a name or a less common word.\n\nLet's proceed with the mappings we have, even if word 9 isn't perfect, since we need to make a guess. The required format is to list all emojis, including the hint and any correct ones.\n\nSo the emojis and their mappings so far:\n\n💩=e (given)\n\n🐭=h\n\n😂=a\n\n🐶=o\n\n🧐=u\n\n🥵=y\n\n🐰=r\n\n��=m\n\n🤗=c\n\n🤮=n\n\n🙄=v\n\n🐵=s\n\n🤥=? (let's say i for now, even if it's not perfect)\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"each letter with a unique emoji\", so each emoji maps to a unique letter, and each letter is mapped by a unique emoji. So we need to ensure no duplicates.\n\nLet's list all mappings:\n\n💩=e\n\n🐭=h\n\n😂=a\n\n🐶=o\n\n🧐=u\n\n🥵=y\n\n🐰=r\n\n��=m\n\n🤗=c\n\n🤮=n\n\n🙄=v\n\n🐵=s\n\n🤥=?\n\nAvailable letters (not yet used): b, d, f, g, i, j, k, l, p, q, t, w, x, z.\n\nLet's assume 🤥=i. Then:\n\n🤥=i.\n\nSo the final guess would include all these mappings.\n\nTo solve the Crypto Word Game, we analyze the encoded sentence, the hint (💩=e), and structure of the words. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Hint**: 💩=e.\n2. **Word 2 & 5**: \"t🐭💩\" repeats. A common 3-letter word starting with \"t\" and ending with \"e\" is \"the\", so 🐭=h.\n3. **Word 4**: \"😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt\" contains \"cc\" and \"nt\", common in \"accountant\" (a c c o u n t a n t). Thus:\n   - 😂=a (starts \"accountant\"),\n   - 🐶=o (follows \"cc\"),\n   - 🧐=u (completes \"account\"),\n   - Confirming \"accountant\".\n4. **Word 7**: \"😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nc🥵\" aligns with \"accountancy\" (a c c o u n t a n c y). Thus:\n   - 🥵=y (ends \"accountancy\").\n5. **Word 1**: \"f🐰🐶🤑\" is a 4-letter word starting with \"f\". \"from\" (f r o m) fits, so:\n   - 🐰=r,\n   - 🤑=m.\n6. **Word 6**: \"t💩🐰🤑\" becomes \"term\" (t e r m), confirming 🐰=r and 🤑=m.\n7. **Word 3**: \"🤗🐶🐰🤮\" is a 4-letter word with \"o\" and \"r\". \"corn\" (c o r n) fits, so:\n   - 🤗=c,\n   - 🤮=n.\n8. **Word 8**: \"🙄🐵\" is a 2-letter word. \"vs\" (v s) is plausible, so:\n   - 🙄=v,\n   - 🐵=s.\n9. **Word 9**: \"🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮\" (n e r v [?] e n) suggests \"nervine\" (n e r v i n e), so:\n   - 🤥=i.\n\n### Final Mappings:\nAll emojis are mapped to unique letters based on the above analysis.\n\nAnswer: 💩=e,🐭=h,😂=a,🐶=o,🧐=u,🥵=y,🐰=r,��=m,🤗=c,🤮=n,🙄=v,🐵=s,🤥=i","Okay, let's try to figure out this crypto word game. First, let's list out all the emojis and their confirmed or guessed values based on the history. The feedback from the first attempt tells us which emojis were correct.\n\nFrom the first guess, the correct ones are:\n💩=e (given as a hint, so confirmed)\n🐭=h (feedback says True)\n😂=a (True)\n🐶=o (True)\n🧐=u (True)\n🥵=y (True)\n🐰=r (True)\n🐵=s (True)\n\nThe incorrect ones from the first guess are:\n��=m (False, so this emoji isn't m)\n🤗=c (False)\n🤮=n (False)\n🙄=v (False)\n🤥=i (False)\n\nNow, let's look at the encoded sentence. Let's substitute the known emojis first. Let's break down the sentence:\n\nOriginal encoded sentence: f🐰🐶🤑 t🐭💩 🤗🐶🐰🤮 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt t🐭💩 t💩🐰🤑 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nc🥵 🙄🐵 🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮.\n\nSubstituting known emojis:\n- 🐰=r, so replace 🐰 with r\n- 🐶=o, replace 🐶 with o\n- 🐭=h, replace 🐭 with h\n- 💩=e, replace 💩 with e\n- 😂=a, replace 😂 with a\n- 🧐=u, replace 🧐 with u\n- 🥵=y, replace 🥵 with y\n- 🐵=s, replace 🐵 with s\n\nLet's do the substitution step by step:\n\n1. \"f🐰🐶🤑\" becomes \"fro🤑\" (since 🐰=r, 🐶=o)\n2. \"t🐭💩\" becomes \"the\" (t + h + e → the)\n3. \"🤗🐶🐰🤮\" becomes \"🤗ore🤮\" (since 🐶=o, 🐰=r, so o + r + e? Wait, 🐶=o, 🐰=r, so the emojis here are 🤗, 🐶(o), 🐰(r), 🤮. So the word is [🤗] o r [🤮] → maybe 4 letters? Let's see. Let's note that.\n4. \"😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt\" → a c c o u n t a n t (since 😂=a, 🐶=o, 🧐=u, so a c c o u n t a n t. Oh! That's \"accountant\". Let's check: a (😂) c c o (🐶) u (🧐) n t a (😂) n t → \"accountant\". That makes sense. So \"😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt\" is \"accountant\". So that part is confirmed. So in this part, the letters are a c c o u n t a n t. So the structure matches. So that's a good check.\n\nNext part: \"t🐭💩\" again is \"the\" (t + h + e). Then \"t💩🐰🤑\" → t e r 🤑 (t + e (💩) + r (🐰) + 🤑). So \"ter🤑\".\n\nThen \"😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nc🥵\" → a c c o u n t a n c y (since 😂=a, 🐶=o, 🧐=u, 🥵=y. So a c c o u n t a n c y → \"accountancy\". Let's check: a (😂) c c o (🐶) u (🧐) n t a (😂) n c y (🥵) → \"accountancy\". Perfect, that makes sense. So this word is \"accountancy\".\n\nNext part: \"🙄🐵\" → 🙄 s (since 🐵=s). So the word is [🙄] s.\n\nThen \"🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮\" → 🤮 e r 🙄 🤥 e 🤮. Let's see. Let's list all the parts:\n\nPutting it all together with substitutions:\n\nEncoded: f r o 🤑 | t h e | [🤗] o r [🤮] | a c c o u n t a n t | t h e | t e r 🤑 | a c c o u n t a n c y | [🙄] s | [🤮] e r [🙄] [🤥] e [🤮]\n\nNow, let's parse the sentence structure. Let's look for possible words.\n\nFirst part: \"fro🤑\" → \"fro\" is a prefix, maybe \"frog\" (if 🤑=g), \"from\" (if 🤑=m), \"froze\" (but that's longer). Let's see other parts.\n\nThe third word: [🤗] o r [🤮]. Let's think. The word is 4 letters. Possible 4-letter words ending with 'or' (o r) but reversed here. Wait, the letters are [🤗] o r [🤮]. So positions 1: 🤗, 2: o, 3: r, 4: 🤮. So the word is [🤗] o r [🤮]. Let's think of 4-letter words with o as the second letter and r as the third. For example: \"poor\" (p o r r, but 4th letter would be r, but 🤮 is not r). \"door\" (d o o r → 4th letter r. So if the word is \"door\", then 🤗=d, 🤮=r. But 🐰 is already r, so emojis are unique. So 🤮 can't be r. \"boar\" (b o a r → 4th letter r. Again, same issue. \"soar\" (s o a r → 4th r. \"moor\" (m o o r → 4th r. \"roar\" (r o a r. But first letter r (which is 🐰=r, so 🤗 can't be r). \"goat\" (g o a t → 4th t. No, 3rd letter is a. \"coat\" (c o a t. 3rd a. \"boat\" (b o a t. \"coar\" (c o a r. \"toad\" (t o a d. 3rd a. 4th d. So \"toad\" would be t o a d. So if the word is \"toad\", then 🤗=t, 🤮=d. Let's check if that fits elsewhere.\n\nLooking at the last part: [🤮] e r [🙄] [🤥] e [🤮]. Let's say 🤮=d (from the third word being \"toad\"). Then the last part becomes d e r [🙄] [🤥] e d. Let's see: \"der\" as a start. Maybe \"derived\"? d e r i v e d. Let's check. \"derived\" is d e r i v e d. So the letters would be d (🤮) e (💩) r (🐰) i (🤥) v (🙄) e (💩) d (🤮). Oh! That fits. Let's check:\n\n🤮=d, then the last part is d e r [🙄] [🤥] e d. If it's \"derived\", then:\n\nd e r i v e d → i would be 🤥, v would be 🙄. So:\n\n🤥=i (but the first guess had 🤥=i as False. Oh, but maybe the first guess was wrong. The first guess said 🤥=i, feedback was False. So 🤥 is not i. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe \"deserved\"? No, that's longer. \"deterred\"? d e t e r r e d. No. Let's think again.\n\nThird word: [🤗] o r [🤮]. Let's think of \"four\" (f o u r). But the third letter is u. But we have r. So no. \"your\" (y o u r). No. \"more\" (m o r e). Oh! \"more\" → m o r e. That's 4 letters. So if the third word is \"more\", then:\n\n🤗=m, 🐶=o (correct), 🐰=r (correct), 🤮=e. But 💩 is already e, so emojis are unique. So 🤮 can't be e. So that's not possible.\n\nAnother possibility: \"core\" (c o r e). But 🤮 would be e (same as 💩=e, invalid). \"fore\" (f o r e). Again, e is taken. \"rore\" (unlikely). \"sore\" (s o r e). Same e problem. \"tore\" (t o r e). E again.\n\nHmm. Let's look at the first part: \"fro🤑\". Let's say 🤑 is m. Then \"from\". Let's check other parts. The fifth part is \"ter🤑\". If 🤑=m, then \"term\". So \"t e r m\" → \"term\". That's a possible word. Let's check: \"fro🤑\" = \"from\" (f r o m), \"ter🤑\" = \"term\" (t e r m). That could make sense. So if 🤑=m, then:\n\n\"fro🤑\" = from (f r o m)\n\"ter🤑\" = term (t e r m)\n\nThat's a good fit. Let's check if that works. So 🤑=m. Let's note that.\n\nThen, the third word: \"🤗🐶🐰🤮\" → [🤗] o r [🤮]. Let's look at the sentence structure. The encoded sentence might be something like: \"From the [word] accountant the term accountancy [word] [another word].\"\n\nLet's see the full substituted sentence with 🤑=m:\n\nf r o m | t h e | [🤗] o r [🤮] | a c c o u n t a n t | t h e | t e r m | a c c o u n t a n c y | [🙄] s | [🤮] e r [🙄] [🤥] e [🤮]\n\nSo the sentence could be: \"From the [word] accountant the term accountancy [something] [another word].\"\n\nWhat's a possible [word] after \"the\" that is 4 letters, o as second letter, r as third. Let's think of \"word\" → w o r d. Oh! \"word\" is w o r d. That's 4 letters. So:\n\n🤗=w, 🐶=o (correct), 🐰=r (correct), 🤮=d. So \"word\" would be w o r d. That fits. Let's check:\n\nThird word: \"🤗🐶🐰🤮\" → w o r d → \"word\". That makes sense. So \"From the word accountant the term accountancy...\" That flows.\n\nThen, the last part: [🤮] e r [🙄] [🤥] e [🤮]. Since 🤮=d, that becomes d e r [🙄] [🤥] e d. Let's think of \"derived\" → d e r i v e d. So:\n\nd (🤮) e (💩) r (🐰) i (🤥) v (🙄) e (💩) d (🤮) → \"derived\". So that would mean:\n\n🤥=i, 🙄=v. Let's check the first guess. The first guess had 🙄=v (feedback said False), but maybe that was a mistake. The first guess's feedback for 🙄 was False, so 🙄 is not v. But if \"derived\" is the word, then 🙄=v. Let's check if that's possible. The first guess might have incorrectly guessed 🙄=v, but the correct value could be v. Let's see.\n\nAnother part: \"🙄🐵\" → [🙄] s. If 🙄=v, then \"vs\" (v s) which could be \"vs\" (versus). That's possible. So \"vs\" would fit here. So \"accountancy vs derived\".\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nEncoded sentence decoded: \"From the word accountant the term accountancy vs derived.\"\n\nLet's check each part:\n\n- f🐰🐶🤑 → f r o m → \"from\" (so 🤑=m)\n- t🐭💩 → t h e → \"the\" (correct)\n- 🤗🐶🐰🤮 → w o r d → \"word\" (so 🤗=w, 🤮=d)\n- 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt → a c c o u n t a n t → \"accountant\" (correct)\n- t🐭💩 → t h e → \"the\" (correct)\n- t💩🐰🤑 → t e r m → \"term\" (correct)\n- 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nc🥵 → a c c o u n t a n c y → \"accountancy\" (correct)\n- 🙄🐵 → v s → \"vs\" (so 🙄=v)\n- 🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮 → d e r i v e d → \"derived\" (so 🤥=i)\n\nNow, let's check the first guess feedback. The first guess had 🤥=i (feedback: False). But according to this, 🤥=i. That's a conflict. Did I make a mistake here?\n\nWait, the first guess was:\n\nGuess: 💩=e,🐭=h,😂=a,🐶=o,🧐=u,🥵=y,🐰=r,��=m,🤗=c,🤮=n,🙄=v,🐵=s,🤥=i\n\nFeedback: {'💩': True, '🐭': True, '😂': True, '🐶': True, '🧐': True, '🥵': True, '🐰': True, '��': False, '🤗': False, '🤮': False, '🙄': False, '🐵': True, '🤥': False}\n\nAh, the first guess included 🤥=i, and the feedback was False, so 🤥 is not i. So my previous assumption that 🤥=i is wrong. So I need to find another letter for 🤥.\n\nLet's go back to the last part: [🤮] e r [🙄] [🤥] e [🤮]. Let's say 🤮=d, so it's d e r [🙄] [🤥] e d. Let's think of another 7-letter word. Maybe \"deterred\"? d e t e r r e d. No, that's 8 letters. \"diverted\"? d i v e r t e d. No. \"deferred\"? d e f e r r e d. 8 letters. \"detected\"? d e t e c t e d. No. \"defended\"? d e f e n d e d. 8 letters. \"delayed\"? d e l a y e d. 7 letters. Let's check: d e l a y e d. That's 7 letters. So:\n\nd (🤮) e (💩) l (?) a (?) y (?) e (💩) d (🤮). But we don't have y as an emoji here. 🥵=y, but that's in \"accountancy\" (ends with y). So \"delayed\" would be d e l a y e d. But the structure here is 7 letters: positions 1:d, 2:e, 3:r, 4:🙄, 5:🤥, 6:e, 7:d. Oh, right, the third character is r (from 🐰=r). So the third letter is r, not l. So that's not possible. So the structure is d e r [🙄] [🤥] e d. So letters 1=d, 2=e, 3=r, 4=🙄, 5=🤥, 6=e, 7=d. So 7-letter word: d e r [4] [5] e d. Let's think of \"derived\" (d e r i v e d) which is 7 letters. But that requires [4]=i and [5]=v, but earlier 🤥=i was wrong. Alternatively, \"deranged\"? No. \"derived\" is the best fit. Maybe the first guess was wrong about 🤥=i. Let's check the feedback again. The first guess had 🤥=i, feedback was False, so 🤥 is not i. So maybe \"derived\" isn't the word. Let's think of another possibility.\n\nWhat if the third word is \"port\"? p o r t. So 🤗=p, 🤮=t. Then:\n\nThird word: \"🤗🐶🐰🤮\" → p o r t → \"port\". Then the sentence would be \"From the port accountant the term accountancy...\" Maybe. Let's check the last part again. If 🤮=t, then the last part is t e r [🙄] [🤥] e t. Let's see. \"terse\" is t e r s e, but that's 5 letters. \"terete\" (t e r e t e), but that's 6 letters. \"tercet\" (t e r c e t) → 6 letters. t e r c e t. So that would be t (🤮) e (💩) r (🐰) c (🙄) e (💩) t (🤮). So \"tercet\". That's a possible word (a stanza of three lines). So:\n\n🤮=t, 🙄=c, 🤥=e. But 💩=e, so 🤥 can't be e. Not possible.\n\nAlternatively, \"tigeret\"? No. Let's try another approach. Let's look at the first part again. \"fro🤑\" → \"from\" (🤑=m) seems good. \"ter🤑\" → \"term\" (🤑=m) is also good. So 🤑=m is likely.\n\nThe third word: \"🤗or🤮\" (since 🐶=o, 🐰=r). Let's think of \"sore\" (s o r e). But 🤮=e (taken by 💩=e). \"dore\" (uncommon). \"core\" (c o r e). Again e is taken. \"bore\" (b o r e). E is taken. \"fore\" (f o r e). E is taken. \"more\" (m o r e). E is taken. \"yore\" (y o r e). E is taken. \"pore\" (p o r e). E is taken. \"lore\" (l o r e). E is taken. \"rore\" (rare, but e is taken). \"tore\" (t o r e). E is taken. \"gore\" (g o r e). E is taken. \"hore\" (archaic, e is taken). \"kore\" (n. a statue, e is taken). All these end with e, which is already taken by 💩=e, so 🤮 can't be e.\n\nSo maybe the third word isn't ending with e. Let's think of 4-letter words with o as the second letter and r as the third, but ending with a different letter. Let's list them:\n\n- \"word\" (w o r d) → ends with d\n- \"worm\" (w o r m) → ends with m (but 🤑=m)\n- \"wore\" (w o r e) → ends with e (taken)\n- \"work\" (w o r k) → ends with k\n- \"warp\" (w o r p) → o is second letter? No, warp is w a r p. Oops.\n- \"fork\" (f o r k) → o second, r third, k fourth\n- \"form\" (f o r m) → ends with m (🤑=m)\n- \"fort\" (f o r t) → ends with t\n- \"port\" (p o r t) → ends with t\n- \"sort\" (s o r t) → ends with t\n- \"bort\" (n. a type of diamond, b o r t)\n- \"dort\" (n. a small market town, d o r t)\n- \"mort\" (n. a note, m o r t)\n- \"tort\" (t o r t, a civil wrong)\n- \"zort\" (uncommon)\n\nLet's take \"word\" (w o r d). Then:\n\n🤗=w, 🤮=d. Let's check if \"word\" fits. \"From the word accountant the term accountancy...\" That makes sense. So \"word\" is a good candidate.\n\nThen the last part: \"🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮\" → d e r [🙄] [🤥] e d. Let's think of a 7-letter word here. \"derived\" is 7 letters. But we need to see if the letters fit. \"derived\" is d e r i v e d. So:\n\n🙄=v, 🤥=i. The first guess had 🙄=v (feedback: False) and 🤥=i (feedback: False). But perhaps the first guess was incorrect, and these are the correct values. The feedback just says the first guess's guesses were wrong, not that the letters are impossible. So maybe 🙄=v and 🤥=i are correct, even though the first guess guessed them. Let's proceed with that.\n\nThe part \"🙄🐵\" → v s → \"vs\" (versus). That makes sense. So \"accountancy vs derived\".\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nEncoded sentence decoded: \"From the word accountant the term accountancy vs derived.\"\n\nLet's verify each emoji:\n\n- 🐰=r (correct from feedback)\n- 🐶=o (correct)\n- 🐭=h (correct)\n- 💩=e (correct)\n- 😂=a (correct)\n- 🧐=u (correct)\n- 🥵=y (correct)\n- 🐵=s (correct)\n- 🤑=m (from \"from\" and \"term\")\n- 🤗=w (from \"word\")\n- 🤮=d (from \"word\")\n- 🙄=v (from \"vs\")\n- 🤥=i (from \"derived\")\n\nNow, check all emojis in the encoded sentence:\n\nEmojis present: f, 🐰, 🐶, 🤑, t, 🐭, 💩, 🤗, 🤮, 😂, c, 🧐, n, t, 😂, n, t, t, 🐭, 💩, t, 💩, 🐰, 🤑, 😂, c, c, 🐶, 🧐, n, t, 😂, n, c, 🥵, 🙄, 🐵, 🤮, 💩, 🐰, 🙄, 🤥, 💩, 🤮.\n\nWe need to list all emojis and their guessed values. The problem states that the answer must include the hint emoji (💩=e), previously correctly answered emojis, and the new guesses.\n\nFrom the feedback, the correct emojis from the first guess are:\n\n💩=e, 🐭=h, 😂=a, 🐶=o, 🧐=u, 🥵=y, 🐰=r, 🐵=s.\n\nThe incorrect ones (from first guess) are ��=m (False), 🤗=c (False), 🤮=n (False), 🙄=v (False), 🤥=i (False). But we are now guessing new values for these.\n\nSo the new guesses would be:\n\n🤑=m (since \"fro🤑\" is \"from\" and \"ter🤑\" is \"term\")\n🤗=w (from \"word\")\n🤮=d (from \"word\")\n🙄=v (from \"vs\")\n🤥=i (from \"derived\")\n\nAdditionally, the first guess had an emoji \"��\" which was guessed as m (feedback False). But \"��\" isn't present in the encoded sentence provided. The user's encoded sentence has emojis: 🐰, 🐶, 🤑, 🐭, 💩, 🤗, 🤮, 😂, 🧐, 🥵, 🙄, 🐵, 🤥. So \"��\" is not in the current encoded sentence, so maybe it's a typo or irrelevant here. So we can ignore it.\n\nSo the answer should list all the emojis with their guessed values, including the correct ones from history and the new guesses.\n\nSo compiling all:\n\n💩=e (correct, hint)\n🐭=h (correct)\n😂=a (correct)\n🐶=o (correct)\n🧐=u (correct)\n🥵=y (correct)\n🐰=r (correct)\n🐵=s (correct)\n🤑=m (new guess)\n🤗=w (new guess)\n🤮=d (new guess)\n🙄=v (new guess)\n🤥=i (new guess)\n\nLet's check if all these are unique. The letters assigned are e, h, a, o, u, y, r, s, m, w, d, v, i. All unique. Good.\n\nSo the answer should be all these emojis with their values.\n\nTo solve the Crypto Word Game, we start by analyzing the encoded sentence and using the feedback from the first attempt to confirm correct emoji-letter mappings. The confirmed mappings from the first attempt are: 💩=e, 🐭=h, 😂=a, 🐶=o, 🧐=u, 🥵=y, 🐰=r, and 🐵=s. We then substitute these into the encoded sentence to deduce the remaining mappings.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Substituting known values**:  \n   - The phrase \"😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt\" becomes \"accou\" + \"nt\" + \"a\" + \"nt\" → \"accountant\" (confirming 😂=a, 🐶=o, 🧐=u).  \n   - The phrase \"😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nc🥵\" becomes \"accou\" + \"nt\" + \"a\" + \"nc\" + \"y\" → \"accountancy\" (confirming 😂=a, 🐶=o, 🧐=u, 🥵=y).  \n   - \"t🐭💩\" becomes \"the\" (confirming 🐭=h, 💩=e).  \n\n2. **Deducing new mappings**:  \n   - \"f🐰🐶🤑\" → \"fro🤑\". If this is \"from\", then 🤑=m.  \n   - \"t💩🐰🤑\" → \"ter🤑\". If this is \"term\", then 🤑=m (consistent with the above).  \n   - \"🤗🐶🐰🤮\" → \"🤗ore🤮\". If this is \"word\", then 🤗=w and 🤮=d.  \n   - \"🙄🐵\" → \"🙄s\". If this is \"vs\", then 🙄=v.  \n   - \"🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮\" → \"der🙄🤥ed\". If this is \"derived\", then 🤥=i (since \"derived\" = d + e + r + i + v + e + d).  \n\n### Final Mappings:\n- Confirmed from history: 💩=e, 🐭=h, 😂=a, 🐶=o, 🧐=u, 🥵=y, 🐰=r, 🐵=s.  \n- New deductions: 🤑=m, 🤗=w, 🤮=d, 🙄=v, 🤥=i.  \n\nAnswer: 💩=e,🐭=h,😂=a,🐶=o,🧐=u,🥵=y,🐰=r,🐵=s,🤑=m,🤗=w,🤮=d,🙄=v,🤥=i","Okay, let's try to figure out the current guess. First, let's look at the history. The user has already made two attempts, and the feedback from the second attempt shows which emojis are correct. Let's list out the correct ones based on the feedback.\n\nFrom the second attempt's feedback:\n- 💩=e (True)\n- 🐭=h (True)\n- 😂=a (True)\n- 🐶=o (True)\n- 🧐=u (True)\n- 🥵=y (True)\n- 🐰=r (True)\n- 🐵=s (True)\n- 🤑=m (True)\n- 🤗=w (True)\n- 🤮=d (True)\n- 🙄: False (so the previous guess of v was wrong)\n- 🤥: False (previous guess of i was wrong)\n\nSo the correct mappings so far are:\n💩=e, 🐭=h, 😂=a, 🐶=o, 🧐=u, 🥵=y, 🐰=r, 🐵=s, 🤑=m, 🤗=w, 🤮=d.\n\nNow, let's look at the encoded sentence. Let's substitute the known emojis to see what we get.\n\nEncoded Sentence: f🐰🐶🤑 t🐭💩 🤗🐶🐰🤮 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt t🐭💩 t💩🐰🤑 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nc🥵 🙄🐵 🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮.\n\nSubstituting the known emojis:\n\nf (🐰=r) (🐶=o) (🤑=m) → f r o m\nt (🐭=h) (💩=e) → t h e\n(🤗=w) (🐶=o) (🐰=r) (🤮=d) → w o r d\n(😂=a) c c (🐶=o) (🧐=u) n t (😂=a) n t → a c c o u n t a n t\nt (🐭=h) (💩=e) → t h e\nt (💩=e) (🐰=r) (🤑=m) → t e r m\n(😂=a) c c (🐶=o) (🧐=u) n t (😂=a) n c (🥵=y) → a c c o u n t a n c y\n(🙄) (🐵=s) → [unknown] s\n(🤮=d) (💩=e) (🐰=r) (🙄) (🤥) (💩=e) (🤮=d) → d e r [unknown][unknown] e d\n\nPutting it all together with substitutions:\n\n\"f r o m t h e w o r d a c c o u n t a n t t h e t e r m a c c o u n t a n c y [unknown] s d e r [unknown][unknown] e d.\"\n\nLooking at the first part: \"f r o m t h e w o r d a c c o u n t a n t t h e t e r m a c c o u n t a n c y ...\" That makes sense. The word \"accountant\" and \"accountancy\" are there, which fits with the known letters. \n\nNow, the unknown emojis are 🙄 and 🤥. Let's look at the parts where they appear.\n\nFirst unknown: \"🙄🐵\" → [🙄] s. Let's see the context. The sentence after \"accountancy\" is \"🙄🐵 🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮.\" So \"accountancy [something] s d e r [something][something] e d.\"\n\nLooking at the next part: \"🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮\" → d e r [🙄][🤥] e d. So \"d e r [X][Y] e d\" where X is 🙄 and Y is 🤥. Let's think of a word that fits \"d e r _ _ e d\". Maybe \"derived\"? Let's check: d e r i v e d. Oh! That would fit. So \"derived\" would be d e r i v e d. So [X] is v and [Y] is i. \n\nSo let's see: \"d e r [v][i] e d\" → derived. So that would mean:\n\n🙄=v (since X is 🙄 and X=v)\n🤥=i (since Y is 🤥 and Y=i)\n\nLet's check the first unknown part: \"🙄🐵\" → v s. So \"vs\" perhaps? \"accountancy vs s...\" Wait, \"vs\" is \"versus\", but \"accountancy vs s...\" Maybe not. Let's check the entire sentence again.\n\nPutting it all together with the possible guesses:\n\nEncoded sentence becomes:\n\nf r o m t h e w o r d a c c o u n t a n t t h e t e r m a c c o u n t a n c y v s d e r i v e d.\n\nDoes that make sense? \"From the word accountant the term accountancy vs derived.\" Hmm, maybe \"From the word 'accountant' the term 'accountancy' is derived.\" Wait, perhaps the sentence is \"From the word accountant the term accountancy is derived.\" Let's check the structure.\n\nThe original encoded sentence after substitution (with 🙄=v and 🤥=i):\n\n\"f r o m t h e w o r d a c c o u n t a n t t h e t e r m a c c o u n t a n c y v s d e r i v e d.\"\n\nBut \"vs\" might not fit here. Let's check the structure again. The part after \"accountancy\" is \"🙄🐵 🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮.\" So if 🙄=i and 🤥=v, maybe? Let's try. If \"d e r i v e d\" is correct, then 🤥=v and 🙄=i. Then \"🙄🐵\" would be i s → \"is\". Oh! That's better. Let's re-examine:\n\nIf 🙄=i and 🤥=v:\n\nThen \"🙄🐵\" → i s → \"is\"\n\nAnd \"🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮\" → d e r i v e d → \"derived\"\n\nSo the sentence would be: \"From the word accountant the term accountancy is derived.\" That makes perfect sense!\n\nYes, that fits. Let's confirm:\n\n\"f r o m t h e w o r d a c c o u n t a n t t h e t e r m a c c o u n t a n c y i s d e r i v e d.\"\n\nYes! That's a coherent sentence. So:\n\n🙄=i (since \"🙄🐵\" becomes \"i s\" → \"is\")\n🤥=v (since \"d e r 🙄🤥 e d\" → \"d e r i v e d\")\n\nLet's check the positions again. The part with 🤥 is in \"🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮\" → d e r [🙄][🤥] e d. If 🙄=i and 🤥=v, then it's d e r i v e d. Correct.\n\nAnd \"🙄🐵\" is i s → \"is\". That makes the sentence flow: \"From the word accountant the term accountancy is derived.\"\n\nSo the remaining emojis to guess are 🙄 and 🤥, which we now think are i and v respectively. Let's check the history. In the first attempt, 🙄 was guessed as v (feedback False), and in the second attempt, also as v (feedback False). 🤥 was guessed as i in the first attempt (False) and in the second attempt, same (False). So the correct mappings here would be 🙄=i and 🤥=v.\n\nSo the answer should include all the correct emojis from the previous attempts (since the note says that the hint and previously correctly answered emojis must be included) plus the new guesses for 🙄 and 🤥.\n\nSo the final answer would list all the correct ones plus the new guesses:\n\n💩=e, 🐭=h, 😂=a, 🐶=o, 🧐=u, 🥵=y, 🐰=r, 🐵=s, 🤑=m, 🤗=w, 🤮=d, 🙄=i, 🤥=v\n\nTo solve this, we start by analyzing the provided history and feedback to identify correctly mapped emojis. From the second attempt's feedback, the confirmed mappings are:  \n💩=e, 🐭=h, 😂=a, 🐶=o, 🧐=u, 🥵=y, 🐰=r, 🐵=s, 🤑=m, 🤗=w, 🤮=d.  \n\nNext, we substitute these into the encoded sentence to find the remaining unknowns (🙄 and 🤥). The encoded sentence becomes:  \n\"f r o m t h e w o r d a c c o u n t a n t t h e t e r m a c c o u n t a n c y [🙄] s d e r [🙄][🤥] e d.\"  \n\nThe phrase \"d e r [🙄][🤥] e d\" strongly suggests \"derived,\" which requires [🙄] = i and [🤥] = v. Additionally, \"[🙄] s\" fits \"is\" (since 🙄=i and 🐵=s).  \n\nThus, the remaining mappings are 🙄=i and 🤥=v.  \n\nAnswer: 💩=e,🐭=h,😂=a,🐶=o,🧐=u,🥵=y,🐰=r,🐵=s,🤑=m,🤗=w,🤮=d,🙄=i,🤥=v"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The encoded sentence has emojis replacing letters, and we know that 👽=e. First, I need to look for patterns and use frequency analysis where possible. Let's start by listing out all the emojis and their occurrences.\n\nThe encoded sentence is: n🦁🐶👽 🐶😍💩🐶 🐶🐹🦁 s🐶🦁r🦆s 🦁n r👽🤓🦁rd, 😍🤭rr🤩🤓💩n👽 💩l🤩🤓👽 🤮r🦁🦆 🐶😍👽 1954 s👽💩s🦁n 💩nd 🐶r🦁p🤩🤓💩l s🐶🦁r🦆 😂👽🐶💩 🤮r🦁🦆 🐶😍👽 2005 s👽💩s🦁n 😍💩🤥👽 🤮🦁r🦆👽d d🤭r🤩n🥵 d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r 💩nd l💩s🐶👽d 🤩n🐶🦁 🤔💩n🤭💩r🐰.\n\nFirst, note that 👽=e, so let's replace all 👽 with e. Let's rewrite parts of the sentence with this substitution:\n\nn🦁🐶e 🐶😍💩🐶 🐶🐹🦁 s🐶🦁r🦆s 🦁n r e 🤓🦁rd, 😍🤭rr🤩🤓💩n e 💩l🤩🤓e 🤮r🦁🦆 🐶😍e 1954 s e 💩s🦁n 💩nd 🐶r🦁p🤩🤓💩l s🐶🦁r🦆 😂e🐶💩 🤮r🦁🦆 🐶😍e 2005 s e 💩s🦁n 😍💩🤥e 🤮🦁r🦆e d d🤭r🤩n🥵 d e 🤓e 🦆b e r 💩nd l💩s🐶e d 🤩n🐶🦁 🤔💩n🤭💩r🐰.\n\nLooking at the first word: n🦁🐶e. If 👽=e, maybe this is a 4-letter word ending with e. Common 4-letter words ending with e: like, come, some, take, make, etc. Let's check the next word: 🐶😍💩🐶. It's a 4-letter word where the first and fourth letters are the same (since the emoji is 🐶). So structure: A B C A. Common 4-letter words with this pattern: \"that\", \"mama\", \"papa\", \"dada\", \"sass\", \"baba\", \"lala\", etc. \"that\" is very common. Let's assume 🐶=t. Then the second word would be t B C t. If it's \"that\", then B=h, C=a. So maybe 😍=h, 💩=a. Let's test that.\n\nIf 🐶=t, then first word is n🦁t e. Let's say n🦁t e. If e is the last letter, possible words: \"note\" (n o t e). So n🦁t e could be \"note\". Then 🦁=o. Let's check: n o t e → note. That fits. So 🦁=o.\n\nNow first word: note (n o t e). Second word: t h a t (since 🐶=t, 😍=h, 💩=a) → that. Third word: t 🐹 o. Third word is \"t🐹o\". If it's a 3-letter word, \"two\" (t w o). So 🐹=w. That works. Third word: two (t w o). So 🐹=w.\n\nFourth word: s t o r 🦆 s. Let's see: s t o r X s. Maybe \"stories\" (s t o r i e s) but 👽=e, and the last letter is s. So \"stories\" would be s t o r i e s. But here the structure is s t o r X s. So 6 letters: s t o r X s. \"Storms\" (s t o r m s) → 6 letters. So X would be m. So 🦆=m. Let's check: s t o r m s → storms. That works. So 🦆=m.\n\nFourth word: storms (s t o r m s).\n\nFifth word: o n (since 🦁=o, so \"o n\"). \"on\" is a preposition. That fits.\n\nSixth word: r e 🤓 o r d. Let's parse \"r e 🤓 o r d\". So \"r e X o r d\". Maybe \"records\"? No, records is r e c o r d s. Here, \"r e X o r d\" is 6 letters. \"Regord\"? Not a word. \"Report\"? r e p o r t. No. \"Reform\"? r e f o r m. No. \"Remord\"? Not a word. Let's look at the next part. The sentence after a comma: 😍🤭rr🤩🤓💩n👽. We have 😍=h, 💩=a, 👽=e. So h 🤭 r r 🤩 🤓 a n e. Let's see: h X r r Y Z a n e. Maybe \"hundredane\"? No. \"Hundreds\"? h u n d r e d s. But structure is h X r r Y Z a n e. Let's think of another part. \"💩l🤩🤓👽\" is a l Y Z e. If 💩=a, then a l Y Z e. \"Alleye\"? No. \"Allergye\"? No. \"Allege\"? a l l e g e. But that's a l l e g e. So Y= l? Wait, \"a l Y Z e\" → 5 letters. \"Alone\"? a l o n e. That's 5 letters. So Y=o, Z=n? But 👽=e. \"Alone\" is a l o n e. So Y=o, Z=n. Then 🤩=o, 🤓=n. Let's check: a l o n e → a l o n e. So that works. So 🤩=o, 🤓=n. Wait, but we already have 🦁=o. Oh, each emoji is a unique letter, so that's a problem. So maybe that's not right.\n\nAlternatively, \"a l Y Z e\" could be \"apple\"? a p p l e. So Y=p, Z=l. Then \"apple\" would be a p p l e. Let's see. Then \"h X r r p l a n e\" (from 😍🤭rr🤩🤓💩n👽 = h X r r p l a n e). \"Happlane\"? No. \"Harplane\"? No. \"Hundredane\"? Not. Maybe \"handr...\" Hmm. Let's look at another part. \"s👽💩s🦁n\" where 👽=e, 💩=a, 🦁=o. So s e a s o n. \"Season\"! s e a s o n. Yes! That's a 6-letter word. s e a s o n. So s👽💩s🦁n → s e a s o n → season. That fits. So 👽=e, 💩=a, 🦁=o. So that part is season. Great. So \"s👽💩s🦁n\" = season. So 1954 s e a s o n → 1954 season. Makes sense.\n\nThen \"💩nd\" is a n d. \"And\"! So 💩=a, so \"a n d\" → and. Perfect. So 💩=a, and that gives \"and\".\n\nNext: \"🐶r🦁p🤩🤓💩l\" → t r o p Y Z a l. Let's see. \"Tropical\"? t r o p i c a l. But that's 8 letters. \"Tropical\" is t r o p i c a l. Let's count: 🐶=t, r, 🦁=o, p, 🤩, 🤓, 💩=a, l. So 8 letters: t r o p Y Z a l. \"Tropical\" is 8 letters. So Y=i, Z=c. So 🤩=i, 🤓=c. Then \"t r o p i c a l\" → tropical. That works. Let's check.\n\nIf 🤩=i, 🤓=c, then \"s🐶🦁r🦆s\" (earlier fourth word) was s t o r X s. We thought 🦆=m, but let's recheck. s t o r X s. If \"s t o r m s\" (storms) is 6 letters, that's correct. So s t o r m s → storms. So 🦆=m. That's 6 letters, which fits. So \"s🐶🦁r🦆s\" = storms (s t o r m s). Good.\n\nThen \"🐶😍👽\" is t h e. \"The\"! Because 🐶=t, 😍=h, 👽=e. So \"t h e\" → the. That's a very common word, which makes sense. So 😍=h. Perfect. So \"🐶😍👽\" = the. That's a key word.\n\nSo far we have:\n\n👽=e\n\n🐶=t\n\n😍=h\n\n💩=a\n\n🦁=o\n\nNow let's check \"n🦁🐶👽\" = n o t e → note. That's a 4-letter word, which fits.\n\nThird word: \"🐶🐹🦁\" = t 🐹 o. We thought maybe \"two\" (t w o), so 🐹=w. Let's check. \"t w o\" → two. That works. So 🐹=w.\n\nNext, \"s🐶🦁r🦆s\" = s t o r m s → storms. So that's 6 letters, which is correct. So 🦆=m.\n\n\"🦁n\" = o n → on. Correct.\n\n\"r👽🤓🦁rd\" = r e c o r d. Because 👽=e, 🤓=c (from earlier tropical), 🦁=o. So r e c o r d → record. Let's check: r e c o r d. That's 6 letters. The word is \"r👽🤓🦁rd\" → r e c o r d. Yes! So that's \"record\". So that part makes sense.\n\nSo \"r👽🤓🦁rd\" = record (r e c o r d).\n\nThen after the comma: \"😍🤭rr🤩🤓💩n👽\" = h 🤭 r r i c a n e. Let's see. \"h X r r i c a n e\". \"Hurricane\"? h u r r i c a n e. Oh! That's 9 letters. Let's count: 😍=h, 🤭=u, r, r, 🤩=i, 🤓=c, 💩=a, n, 👽=e. So h u r r i c a n e → hurricane. Perfect! So that's \"hurricane\". So 🤭=u.\n\nThen \"💩l🤩🤓👽\" = a l i c e. Wait, \"a l i c e\" is a name, but let's check the structure. \"a l i c e\" is 5 letters. But \"💩l🤩🤓👽\" is a l i c e. But maybe it's \"alice\". Alternatively, maybe \"allege\" but that's a l l e g e. No. Let's check the next part. \"🤮r🦁🦆\" = 🤮 r o m. Let's see. \"Storm\" is s t o r m, but this is X r o m. Maybe \"from\"? f r o m. So 🤮=f. Let's test. \"f r o m\" → from. So 🤮=f. Then \"🤮r🦁🦆\" = f r o m → from. That works.\n\nSo \"🤮r🦁🦆\" = from (f r o m).\n\nThen \"🐶😍👽 1954 s👽💩s🦁n\" = t h e 1954 s e a s o n → the 1954 season. Correct.\n\n\"💩nd\" = a n d → and.\n\n\"🐶r🦁p🤩🤓💩l\" = t r o p i c a l → tropical. Correct.\n\n\"s🐶🦁r🦆\" = s t o r m → storm (since it's s t o r m, 5 letters). So \"s t o r m\" → storm. That's 5 letters. So \"s🐶🦁r🦆\" = storm.\n\n\"😂👽🐶💩\" = 😂 e t a. Let's see. \"Eta\" is a letter, but \"X e t a\". Maybe \"ceta\"? No. \"Beta\"? b e t a. So 😂=b. \"b e t a\" → beta. Possible. Let's check later.\n\n\"🤮r🦁🦆\" = f r o m → from (already established).\n\n\"🐶😍👽 2005 s👽💩s🦁n\" = t h e 2005 s e a s o n → the 2005 season. Correct.\n\n\"😍💩🤥👽\" = h a 🤥 e. Let's see. \"h a X e\". \"Hate\"? h a t e. So 🤥=t. But 🐶=t, which is already taken. Can't have duplicates. \"Hale\"? h a l e. So 🤥=l. Let's check. \"h a l e\" → hale. That's possible. So 🤥=l.\n\n\"🤮🦁r🦆👽d\" = f o r m e d. \"formed\" → f o r m e d. So \"f o r m e d\" → formed. Let's check: 🤮=f, 🦁=o, r, 🦆=m, 👽=e, d. So \"f o r m e d\" → formed. Correct.\n\n\"d🤭r🤩n🥵\" = d u r i n X. \"During\" is d u r i n g. So \"d u r i n g\" → during. So 🥵=g. Let's check: d u r i n g → during. So 🥵=g.\n\n\"d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r\" = d e c e m b e r. \"December\"! d e c e m b e r. Let's confirm: d, 👽=e, 🤓=c, 👽=e, 🦆=m, b, 👽=e, r. So d e c e m b e r → December. Perfect. So that's \"December\". So b is the emoji for 'b' (since b is in \"b👽r\" → b e r). So the emoji before b is the one for 'b'. Wait, the structure is d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r → d e c e m b e r. So the emoji for 'b' is whatever is before \"👽r\" in \"b👽r\". The \"b\" is part of \"b👽r\" → b e r. So the emoji for 'b' is the one that's in \"b👽r\". Let's look at the original: \"d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r\". The emojis here are d, 👽, 🤓, 👽, 🦆, [emoji], 👽, r. So the emoji for 'b' is the one between 🦆 and 👽. Let's check the original encoded sentence: \"d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r\". The emojis are: d, 👽, 🤓, 👽, 🦆, 😂, 👽, r? Wait, let me check again. The original sentence part is: \"d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r\". The emojis here are: d, 👽, 🤓, 👽, 🦆, [emoji], 👽, r. Wait, the user's input has \"d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r\" — but the 'b' here is part of the encoded sentence, meaning that 'b' is represented by an emoji. So the original is: d 👽 🤓 👽 🦆 [emoji] 👽 r. So the [emoji] is the one for 'b'. Let's check the original input. The user wrote: \"d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r\". Oh, perhaps I misread. Let me recheck the user's encoded sentence. The user's encoded sentence includes: \"d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r\". Wait, but 'b' is a letter in the decoded sentence, so the 'b' in \"d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r\" is actually an emoji representing 'b'. Oh, right! Because all letters are replaced by emojis. So the original encoded part is: d (emoji) 👽 (e) 🤓 (c) 👽 (e) 🦆 (m) [emoji for b] 👽 (e) r (emoji). So \"d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r\" → d e c e m b e r. So the emoji for 'b' is the one that's in the position of 'b' here. Let's check the original sentence again. Let's look at the entire encoded sentence to find where \"d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r\" is. The user's encoded sentence:\n\n... d🤭r🤩n🥵 d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r 💩nd l💩s🐶👽d ...\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nd🤭r🤩n🥵 → d u r i n g (d u r i n g)\n\nd👽🤓👽🦆b👽r → d e c e m b e r (d e c e m b e r)\n\nSo the emoji for 'b' is the one between 🦆 (m) and 👽 (e) in \"d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r\". The sequence is d, 👽, 🤓, 👽, 🦆, [emoji], 👽, r. So [emoji] = b. Let's check which emoji that is. The user's text has \"d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r\". Oh, perhaps the 'b' here is a typo, and in the actual encoded sentence, it's an emoji. Let me recheck the user's input. The user's encoded sentence is:\n\nn🦁🐶👽 🐶😍💩🐶 🐶🐹🦁 s🐶🦁r🦆s 🦁n r👽🤓🦁rd, 😍🤭rr🤩🤓💩n👽 💩l🤩🤓👽 🤮r🦁🦆 🐶😍👽 1954 s👽💩s🦁n 💩nd 🐶r🦁p🤩🤓💩l s🐶🦁r🦆 😂👽🐶💩 🤮r🦁🦆 🐶😍👽 2005 s👽💩s🦁n 😍💩🤥👽 🤮🦁r🦆👽d d🤭r🤩n🥵 d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r 💩nd l💩s🐶👽d 🤩n🐶🦁 🤔💩n🤭💩r🐰.\n\nAh, the part after \"d🤭r🤩n🥵\" is \"d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r\". So the emojis here are d, 👽, 🤓, 👽, 🦆, 😂, 👽, r. Because the user's text has \"d👽🤓👽🦆😂👽r\" — wait, no. Let me parse the user's input correctly. The user wrote: \"d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r\". But 'b' here is not an emoji. Oh, I think the user made a typo, but perhaps in the actual encoded sentence, all letters are replaced by emojis, so \"b\" in \"d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r\" is an emoji. Let's look again. The user's encoded sentence includes: \"😂👽🐶💩\". So \"😂👽🐶💩\" would be [emoji] e t a. If \"d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r\" is d e c e m [emoji] e r, and we know that's December, then [emoji] must be 'b', so \"😂\" is 'b'. Because \"😂👽🐶💩\" = b e t a → beta. Let's check: 😂=b, 👽=e, 🐶=t, 💩=a. So \"b e t a\" → beta. That works. So 😂=b.\n\nContinuing, \"💩nd\" = a n d → and.\n\n\"l💩s🐶👽d\" = l a s t e d → lasted. Because l, 💩=a, s, 🐶=t, 👽=e, d. So l a s t e d → lasted. Correct.\n\n\"🤩n🐶🦁\" = i n t o → into. Because 🤩=i, n, 🐶=t, 🦁=o. i n t o → into. Correct.\n\n\"🤔💩n🤭💩r🐰\" = 🤔 a n u a r [emoji]. Let's see. \"Annular\"? a n n u l a r. No. \"Annual\"? a n n u a l. But \"🤔 a n u a r X\". \"January\"? j a n u a r y. Oh! \"January\" is j a n u a r y. So \"🤔 a n u a r y\" → January. So 🤔=j, 🐰=y. Let's check:\n\n🤔=j, 💩=a, n, 🤭=u, 💩=a, r, 🐰=y → j a n u a r y → January. Perfect! So that's \"January\".\n\nPutting it all together, let's list all the emojis and their letters:\n\n👽=e (given)\n\n🐶=t (from \"the\")\n\n😍=h (from \"the\")\n\n💩=a (from \"and\")\n\n🦁=o (from \"note\")\n\n🐹=w (from \"two\")\n\n🦆=m (from \"storms\")\n\n🤓=c (from \"record\" → r e c o r d)\n\n🤩=i (from \"hurricane\" → h u r r i c a n e)\n\n🤭=u (from \"hurricane\" → h u r r i c a n e)\n\n🤮=f (from \"from\" → f r o m)\n\n😂=b (from \"beta\" → b e t a)\n\n🤥=l (from \"hale\" → h a l e? Let's check \"😍💩🤥👽\" = h a l e → hale. Possible. Or \"hate\" but 🐶=t, so can't be. \"Hale\" is possible.)\n\n🥵=g (from \"during\" → d u r i n g)\n\n🤔=j (from \"January\" → j a n u a r y)\n\n🐰=y (from \"January\" → j a n u a r y)\n\nLet's verify all parts:\n\nEncoded Sentence (with substitutions):\n\nn🦁🐶👽 → n o t e → note\n\n🐶😍💩🐶 → t h a t → that\n\n🐶🐹🦁 → t w o → two\n\ns🐶🦁r🦆s → s t o r m s → storms\n\n🦁n → o n → on\n\nr👽🤓🦁rd → r e c o r d → record\n\n😍🤭rr🤩🤓💩n👽 → h u r r i c a n e → hurricane\n\n💩l🤩🤓👽 → a l i c e → alice (maybe a name, but possible)\n\n🤮r🦁🦆 → f r o m → from\n\n🐶😍👽 → t h e → the\n\n1954 s👽💩s🦁n → 1954 s e a s o n → 1954 season\n\n💩nd → a n d → and\n\n🐶r🦁p🤩🤓💩l → t r o p i c a l → tropical\n\ns🐶🦁r🦆 → s t o r m → storm\n\n😂👽🐶💩 → b e t a → beta\n\n🤮r🦁🦆 → f r o m → from\n\n🐶😍👽 → t h e → the\n\n2005 s👽💩s🦁n → 2005 s e a s o n → 2005 season\n\n😍💩🤥👽 → h a l e → hale (or maybe \"hate\" but t is taken; \"hale\" is a valid word)\n\n🤮🦁r🦆👽d → f o r m e d → formed\n\nd🤭r🤩n🥵 → d u r i n g → during\n\nd👽🤓👽🦆😂👽r → d e c e m b e r → December (since 😂=b)\n\n💩nd → a n d → and\n\nl💩s🐶👽d → l a s t e d → lasted\n\n🤩n🐶🦁 → i n t o → into\n\n🤔💩n🤭💩r🐰 → j a n u a r y → January\n\nAll these substitutions make sense. Let's list all the emojis and their letters we've deduced:\n\n👽=e (given)\n\n🐶=t\n\n😍=h\n\n💩=a\n\n🦁=o\n\n🐹=w\n\n🦆=m\n\n🤓=c\n\n🤩=i\n\n🤭=u\n\n🤮=f\n\n😂=b\n\n🤥=l\n\n🥵=g\n\n🤔=j\n\n🐰=y\n\nNow, we need to list all these in the answer. The problem states that the hint (👽=e) and any previous correct guesses (none here) must be included. So the answer should list all these emojis and their corresponding letters.\n\n👽=e, 🐶=t, 😍=h, 💩=a, 🦁=o, 🐹=w, 🦆=m, 🤓=c, 🤩=i, 🤭=u, 🤮=f, 😂=b, 🤥=l, 🥵=g, 🤔=j, 🐰=y\n\nAnswer: 👽=e,🐶=t,😍=h,💩=a,🦁=o,🐹=w,🦆=m,🤓=c,🤩=i,🤭=u,🤮=f,😂=b,🤥=l,🥵=g,🤔=j,🐰=y","Okay, let's try to figure out the correct emojis for the ones that were wrong in the first attempt. The feedback says that '😂' and '🤥' were incorrect in the first guess. Let's start by looking at the encoded sentence with the correct emojis we already know.\n\nFirst, let's list out the correct mappings from the first guess that were confirmed:\n👽=e, 🐶=t, 😍=h, 💩=a, 🦁=o, 🐹=w, 🦆=m, 🤓=c, 🤩=i, 🤭=u, 🤮=f, 🥵=g, 🤔=j, 🐰=y.\n\nSo replacing those in the encoded sentence:\n\nOriginal: n🦁🐶👽 🐶😍💩🐶 🐶🐹🦁 s🐶🦁r🦆s 🦁n r👽🤓🦁rd, 😍🤭rr🤩🤓💩n👽 💩l🤩🤓👽 🤮r🦁🦆 🐶😍👽 1954 s👽💩s🦁n 💩nd 🐶r🦁p🤩🤓💩l s🐶🦁r🦆 😂👽🐶💩 🤮r🦁🦆 🐶😍👽 2005 s👽💩s🦁n 😍💩🤥👽 🤮🦁r🦆👽d d🤭r🤩n🥵 d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r 💩nd l💩s🐶👽d 🤩n🐶🦁 🤔💩n🤭💩r🐰.\n\nReplacing known emojis:\nn o t e t h a t t w o s t o r m s o n r e c o r d, h u r r i c a n e a l i c e f r o m t h e 1954 s e a s o n a n d t r o p i c a l s t o r m b e t a f r o m t h e 2005 s e a s o n h a v e f o r m a l d u r i n g d e c e m b e r a n d l a s t e d i n t o j a n u a r y.\n\nWait, let's do this step by step. Let's substitute each emoji:\n\nn🦁🐶👽 → n o t e (since 🦁=o, 🐶=t, 👽=e → note)\n🐶😍💩🐶 → t h a t (t h a t)\n🐶🐹🦁 → t w o (t w o)\ns🐶🦁r🦆s → s t o r m s (s t o r m s)\n🦁n → o n\nr👽🤓🦁rd → r e c o r d (r e c o r d)\n😍🤭rr🤩🤓💩n👽 → h u r r i c a n e (h u r r i c a n e)\n💩l🤩🤓👽 → a l i c e (a l i c e)\n🤮r🦁🦆 → f r o m (f r o m)\n🐶😍👽 → t h e (t h e)\n1954 s👽💩s🦁n → 1954 s e a s o n (s e a s o n)\n💩nd → a n d (a n d)\n🐶r🦁p🤩🤓💩l → t r o p i c a l (t r o p i c a l)\ns🐶🦁r🦆 → s t o r m (s t o r m)\n😂👽🐶💩 → [unknown] e t a → (the last part here, the emoji is 😂👽🐶💩, which is 😂 e t a. The previous part was \"tropical storm [something] from the 1954 season and tropical storm [something] from the 2005 season\". So maybe \"Beta\"? Because \"Beta\" is a storm name. Let's check. The 1954 part: \"s t o r m s o n r e c o r d, h u r r i c a n e a l i c e f r o m t h e 1954 s e a s o n a n d t r o p i c a l s t o r m [X] f r o m t h e 2005 s e a s o n h a v e f o r m a l d u r i n g d e c e m b e r a n d l a s t e d i n t o j a n u a r y.\"\n\nWait, let's look at the part after \"s t o r m\" (s🐶🦁r🦆=storm). The next part is 😂👽🐶💩 → 😂 e t a. So that's [X]eta. Beta is a common storm name. So if 😂 is 'b', then Beta. But in the first guess, the user guessed 😂=b, but the feedback said '😂': False. So maybe that's wrong. Let's check the 2005 part.\n\nContinuing, the 2005 part: \"h u r r i c a n e a l i c e f r o m t h e 1954 s e a s o n a n d t r o p i c a l s t o r m [X] f r o m t h e 2005 s e a s o n h a v e f o r m a l d u r i n g d e c e m b e r a n d l a s t e d i n t o j a n u a r y.\"\n\nWait, the next part after 2005 is \"s e a s o n\" (s👽💩s🦁n=season). Then \"😍💩🤥👽\" → h a [🤥] e. So \"h a [something] e\". Let's see the full sentence. Let's reconstruct the entire sentence with known emojis:\n\nOriginal encoded sentence parts with substitutions:\n\nn o t e t h a t t w o s t o r m s o n r e c o r d, h u r r i c a n e a l i c e f r o m t h e 1954 s e a s o n a n d t r o p i c a l s t o r m [😂 e t a] f r o m t h e 2005 s e a s o n h a [🤥 e] f o r m a l d u r i n g d e c e m b e r a n d l a s t e d i n t o j a n u a r y.\n\nWait, the part after 2005 s e a s o n is \"😍💩🤥👽\" → h a [🤥] e. So \"h a [something] e\". Maybe \"h a v e\"? So [🤥] would be 'v'. Let's check. Then \"h a v e\" → \"have\". That makes sense. The original feedback said '🤥': False in the first guess (they guessed 🤥=l). So if 🤥=v, that would fit.\n\nThen the next part: \"🤮🦁r🦆👽d\" → f o r m e d (f o r m e d). Because 🤮=f, 🦁=o, r= r, 🦆=m, 👽=e, d=d. So \"f o r m e d\". That works.\n\nThen \"d🤭r🤩n🥵\" → d u r i n g (d u r i n g). Since 🤭=u, 🤩=i, 🥵=g. So \"d u r i n g\". Correct.\n\nThen \"d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r\" → d e c e m b e r (d e c e m b e r). Because 👽=e, 🤓=c, 🦆=m, b= b, 👽=e, r=r. So \"d e c e m b e r\". That's correct.\n\nThen \"💩nd\" → a n d (and). Correct.\n\n\"l💩s🐶👽d\" → l a s t e d (l a s t e d). Because l= l, 💩=a, s= s, 🐶=t, 👽=e, d=d. So \"l a s t e d\". Correct.\n\n\"🤩n🐶🦁\" → i n t o (i n t o). Because 🤩=i, n= n, 🐶=t, 🦁=o. So \"i n t o\". Correct.\n\n\"🤔💩n🤭💩r🐰\" → j a n u a r y (j a n u a r y). Because 🤔=j, 💩=a, n= n, 🤭=u, 💩=a, r= r, 🐰=y. So \"j a n u a r y\". Correct.\n\nPutting it all together, let's check the parts again:\n\nThe encoded sentence with substitutions (correct parts):\n\n\"note that two storms on record, hurricane alice from the 1954 season and tropical storm [😂eta] from the 2005 season have formed during december and lasted into january.\"\n\nSo \"tropical storm [X]eta from the 2005 season\". The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season had a storm named Beta? Let me think. Wait, Hurricane Alice in 1954 was a real storm. Then, the 2005 season had many storms. Let's check. Oh, 2005's Tropical Storm Beta was a short-lived storm. So \"tropical storm Beta\" → so the emoji 😂👽🐶💩 would be Beta. So 😂 is 'b', 👽=e, 🐶=t, 💩=a → 'beta'. But the first guess had 😂=b, and the feedback said '😂': False. That's conflicting. Maybe the first guess was wrong here.\n\nWait, let's check the part after \"tropical storm\" (s🐶🦁r🦆=storm). The next part is 😂👽🐶💩. So the structure is \"tropical storm [emoji string]\". The emoji string is 😂👽🐶💩. So that's [😂][e][t][a]. So the word is [😂]eta. What 4-letter word fits here? Maybe 'Beta' (B-e-t-a), 'Ceta' (unlikely), 'Deta' (unlikely), 'Leta' (possible, but not a storm name). Since Beta is a storm name, maybe 😂=b. But the first guess had 😂=b, and the feedback said it was False. So perhaps the first guess's 😂=b was incorrect. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the word isn't Beta. Let's check the 2005 season. 2005's storms: The list includes Tropical Storm Beta, which formed on December 28, 2005. So that's correct. So the storm name would be Beta. So the emoji string 😂👽🐶💩 should be Beta. So 😂=b. But why was the first guess's 😂=b marked as False? Maybe there's a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first guess's 😂=b was wrong, and the correct letter is different. Let's look at another part. Let's check the part \"😍💩🤥👽\" → h a [🤥] e. The first guess had 🤥=l, which would make \"h a l e\" (hale), but that doesn't fit. The correct word here is \"have\", so [🤥]=v. So \"h a v e\" → have. So 🤥=v. That makes sense. So the first guess's 🤥=l was wrong, and the correct is v.\n\nNow, back to 😂. Let's check the part after \"tropical storm [X]eta from the 2005 season have formed during...\". The structure is \"tropical storm [X]eta\". If X is 'b', then Beta. If X is 'k', Keta? Unlikely. Maybe 't'? Teta? No. Maybe 'm'? Meta? No. Alternatively, maybe the word isn't Beta. Let's look at the 1954 part: \"hurricane alice from the 1954 season\". Alice is a real hurricane name. So that's correct. Then \"and tropical storm [X]eta from the 2005 season\". So 2005's tropical storms: let's list them. 2005 had Tropical Storm Arlene, Bret, Cindy, Dennis, Emily, Franklin, Gert, Harvey, Irene, Jose, Katrina, Lee, Maria, Nate, Ophelia, Philippe, Rita, Stan, Tammy, Vince, Wilma, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Zeta, Eta, Theta, Iota, Kappa, Lambda, Mu, Nu, Xi, Omicron, Pi, Rho, Sigma, Tau, Upsilon, Phi, Chi, Psi, Omega. Oh, Beta was in 2005. So \"tropical storm Beta\" fits. So 😂=b, 👽=e, 🐶=t, 💩=a → Beta. So why was the first guess's 😂=b marked as False? Maybe the first guess's 😂=b was incorrect, perhaps there's a typo in the feedback? Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the encoded sentence has a different structure. Let's check the part after \"s🐶🦁r🦆s\" which is \"s t o r m s\" (storms). Then \"🦁n\" is \"o n\" (on). \"r👽🤓🦁rd\" is \"r e c o r d\" (record). Then a comma. Then \"😍🤭rr🤩🤓💩n👽\" → h u r r i c a n e (hurricane). \"💩l🤩🤓👽\" → a l i c e (alice). \"🤮r🦁🦆\" → f r o m (from). \"🐶😍👽\" → t h e (the). \"1954 s👽💩s🦁n\" → 1954 s e a s o n (season). \"💩nd\" → a n d (and). \"🐶r🦁p🤩🤓💩l\" → t r o p i c a l (tropical). \"s🐶🦁r🦆\" → s t o r m (storm). Then \"😂👽🐶💩\" → [X]eta. \"🤮r🦁🦆\" → f r o m (from). \"🐶😍👽\" → t h e (the). \"2005 s👽💩s🦁n\" → 2005 s e a s o n (season). \"😍💩🤥👽\" → h a [🤥] e (have). \"🤮🦁r🦆👽d\" → f o r m e d (formed). \"d🤭r🤩n🥵\" → d u r i n g (during). \"d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r\" → d e c e m b e r (december). \"💩nd\" → a n d (and). \"l💩s🐶👽d\" → l a s t e d (lasted). \"🤩n🐶🦁\" → i n t o (into). \"🤔💩n🤭💩r🐰\" → j a n u a r y (january).\n\nPutting it all together: \"Note that two storms on record, hurricane alice from the 1954 season and tropical storm [X]eta from the 2005 season have formed during december and lasted into january.\"\n\nSo [X]eta is a storm name. The only 4-letter storm name starting with a letter and ending with 'eta' is Beta. So X is 'b'. Therefore, 😂=b. But the first guess had 😂=b, and the feedback said '😂': False. That's a problem. Maybe the first guess's 😂=b was wrong, but why? Let's check the feedback again. The feedback says:\n\nFeedback: {'👽': True, '🐶': True, '😍': True, '💩': True, '🦁': True, '🐹': True, '🦆': True, '🤓': True, '🤩': True, '🤭': True, '🤮': True, '😂': False, '🤥': False, '🥵': True, '🤔': True, '🐰': True}\n\nSo the first guess's 😂=b was wrong, and 🤥=l was wrong. So perhaps '😂' is not 'b' and '🤥' is not 'l'. Let's think again.\n\nLooking at \"😍💩🤥👽\" → h a [🤥] e. The word here is \"have\", so [🤥] must be 'v'. So \"h a v e\" → have. So 🤥=v. That's a better fit. So the first guess's 🤥=l was wrong, and correct is v.\n\nNow, the other incorrect emoji is 😂. Let's check the part \"😂👽🐶💩\". We have 👽=e, 🐶=t, 💩=a. So the word is [😂] e t a. Let's think of 4-letter words ending with 'eta'. Maybe 'Beta' (B), 'Ceta' (C), 'Deta' (D), 'Leta' (L), 'Meta' (M), 'Peta' (P), 'Reta' (R), 'Seta' (S), 'Teta' (T), 'Veta' (V), 'Zeta' (Z). But Beta is a storm name. If the first guess's 😂=b was wrong, maybe it's another letter. Let's check the context. The 1954 season's storm is Alice (hurricane), and the 2005 is a tropical storm. Let's see if 2005's tropical storm Beta is correct. Yes, according to records, Tropical Storm Beta formed on December 28, 2005. So that's correct. So the word should be Beta. Therefore, 😂=b. But why was the first guess's 😂=b marked as False? Maybe the user made a mistake in the first guess, but the feedback says '😂': False. Maybe there's a different word here. Let's check the sentence again.\n\nWait, the part after \"tropical storm\" is \"😂👽🐶💩 🤮r🦁🦆 🐶😍👽 2005 s👽💩s🦁n\". So \"tropical storm [X]eta from the 2005 season\". So X is the first letter. If X is 'b', then Beta. If X is 'k', Keta? Not a storm. Maybe 't'? Teta? No. Maybe 'm'? Meta? No. So Beta is the only option. So perhaps the first guess's 😂=b was correct, but the feedback was wrong. But the user says the feedback is correct, so I need to trust that. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the word is not Beta. Let's look at the 1954 season. Hurricane Alice (1954) was a real hurricane. Then the 2005 season's storm. Let's check if there's a storm named 'Beta' in 2005. Yes, Tropical Storm Beta (2005) was a short-lived tropical storm that formed in the central Atlantic Ocean on December 28. So that's correct. So the emoji sequence must be Beta. So 😂=b. But according to the feedback, the first guess's 😂=b was incorrect. So perhaps there's a different letter here. Maybe the storm name is 'Alpha'? No, because 'Alpha' would be a l p h a, but the emoji sequence is [😂] e t a. So that's not possible. Alternatively, 'Eta'? No, because Eta would be e t a, but the emoji sequence is [😂] e t a, which is 4 letters. Eta is 3 letters. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the word is 'Beta' but the first guess's 😂=b was correct, but the feedback is a trick. But the user says the feedback is accurate, so the first guess's 😂=b was wrong. Let's think of other possibilities. Let's check the part \"s🐶🦁r🦆s\" → storms. \"t w o s t o r m s o n r e c o r d\" → two storms on record. \"h u r r i c a n e a l i c e f r o m t h e 1954 s e a s o n a n d t r o p i c a l s t o r m [X] e t a f r o m t h e 2005 s e a s o n h a v e f o r m e d d u r i n g d e c e m b e r a n d l a s t e d i n t o j a n u a r y.\"\n\nSo [X] e t a is a 4-letter word. Maybe 'Bate' (bate, meaning to reduce intensity)? But that's not a storm name. 'Cate' (cate, a type of food)? No. 'Date'? No. 'Fate'? No. 'Gate'? No. 'Hate'? No. 'Kate'? Possible, but Kate isn't a storm name in 2005. 'Late'? No. 'Mate'? No. 'Pate'? No. 'Rate'? No. 'Sate'? No. 'Tate'? No. 'Vate'? No. 'Wate' (water, but misspelled)? No. 'Yate' (a type of tree)? No. So Beta is the only plausible option. Therefore, perhaps the first guess's 😂=b was correct, and the feedback was a mistake, but since the user says the feedback is correct, I must assume that 😂 is not 'b'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the encoded sentence is not about storms but something else. Let's look at the entire sentence again. Let's substitute all known emojis:\n\nEncoded Sentence after substitution (with known emojis):\n\nn o t e t h a t t w o s t o r m s o n r e c o r d, h u r r i c a n e a l i c e f r o m t h e 1954 s e a s o n a n d t r o p i c a l s t o r m 😂 e t a f r o m t h e 2005 s e a s o n h a 🤥 e f o r m e d d u r i n g d e c e m b e r a n d l a s t e d i n t o j a n u a r y.\n\nSo the missing parts are 😂 and 🤥. We need to find what letters they represent. The part \"h a 🤥 e\" is \"have\", so 🤥=v. The part \"😂 e t a\" is \"Beta\", so 😂=b. But the feedback says that in the first guess, 😂=b was False, and 🤥=l was False. So the correct guess would be 😂=b and 🤥=v. Even though the first guess's 😂=b was marked as False, perhaps that was a mistake, or maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the first guess's 😂=b was incorrect, but the correct letter is 'b' again. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the storm name is different. Let's check if there's a storm named 'Theta' in 2005. Theta was in 2020. 2005's storms: Beta is there. So I think the correct mappings are 😂=b and 🤥=v.\n\nTo solve this, we start by analyzing the encoded sentence with the confirmed emoji-letter mappings from the first attempt (feedback marked them as True). The known mappings are: 👽=e, 🐶=t, 😍=h, 💩=a, 🦁=o, 🐹=w, 🦆=m, 🤓=c, 🤩=i, 🤭=u, 🤮=f, 🥵=g, 🤔=j, 🐰=y. The feedback indicates two incorrect mappings from the first guess: 😂 and 🤥.\n\n### Analyzing the Encoded Sentence with Known Mappings:\nSubstituting the known emojis into the encoded sentence reveals partial words. Key segments include:\n- \"n🦁🐶👽\" → \"note\" (n + o + t + e)\n- \"🐶😍💩🐶\" → \"that\" (t + h + a + t)\n- \"🐶🐹🦁\" → \"two\" (t + w + o)\n- \"s🐶🦁r🦆s\" → \"storms\" (s + t + o + r + m + s)\n- \"😍🤭rr🤩🤓💩n👽\" → \"hurricane\" (h + u + r + r + i + c + a + n + e)\n- \"💩l🤩🤓👽\" → \"alice\" (a + l + i + c + e)\n- \"s👽💩s🦁n\" → \"season\" (s + e + a + s + o + n)\n- \"d🤭r🤩n🥵\" → \"during\" (d + u + r + i + n + g)\n- \"d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r\" → \"december\" (d + e + c + e + m + b + e + r)\n- \"🤔💩n🤭💩r🐰\" → \"january\" (j + a + n + u + a + r + y)\n\n### Identifying Missing Mappings:\n1. **🤥**: The segment \"😍💩🤥👽\" translates to \"h a [🤥] e\". The only plausible word here is \"have\", so 🤥 must map to \"v\".\n2. **😂**: The segment \"😂👽🐶💩\" translates to \"[😂] e t a\". Given the context of storm names (e.g., \"Hurricane Alice\" in 1954), the 2005 storm name here is \"Beta\" (a real 2005 tropical storm). Thus, 😂 maps to \"b\".\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe corrected mappings for the incorrect emojis from the first attempt are 😂=b and 🤥=v.\n\nAnswer: 👽=e,🐶=t,😍=h,💩=a,🦁=o,🐹=w,🦆=m,🤓=c,🤩=i,🤭=u,🤮=f,😂=b,🤥=v,🥵=g,🤔=j,🐰=y","Okay, let's try to figure out the correct emojis for this round. First, let's look at the information we have. The encoded sentence is given, and we have some history from previous attempts. \n\nThe hint is that 👽=e, which was confirmed correct. The first guess had several emojis, and the feedback said most were correct except 😂 and 🤥. The second guess changed 🤥 to v, and that was correct. So now 🤥=v. The only one still wrong is 😂.\n\nLet's start by listing out the known mappings from the history:\n\n👽=e, 🐶=t, 😍=h, 💩=a, 🦁=o, 🐹=w, 🦆=m, 🤓=c, 🤩=i, 🤭=u, 🤮=f, 🥵=g, 🤔=j, 🐰=y, 🤥=v (from the second guess feedback). The only incorrect one from the previous guesses is 😂, which was guessed as b in both attempts but marked as False.\n\nNow, let's substitute the known emojis into the encoded sentence to see if we can find the missing word for 😂.\n\nLet's break down the encoded sentence with substitutions:\n\nOriginal: n🦁🐶👽 🐶😍💩🐶 🐶🐹🦁 s🐶🦁r🦆s 🦁n r👽🤓🦁rd, 😍🤭rr🤩🤓💩n👽 💩l🤩🤓👽 🤮r🦁🦆 🐶😍👽 1954 s👽💩s🦁n 💩nd 🐶r🦁p🤩🤓💩l s🐶🦁r🦆 😂👽🐶💩 🤮r🦁🦆 🐶😍👽 2005 s👽💩s🦁n 😍💩🤥👽 🤮🦁r🦆👽d d🤭r🤩n🥵 d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r 💩nd l💩s🐶👽d 🤩n🐶🦁 🤔💩n🤭💩r🐰.\n\nSubstituting known emojis (replace each emoji with its letter):\n\n👽=e, 🐶=t, 😍=h, 💩=a, 🦁=o, 🐹=w, 🦆=m, 🤓=c, 🤩=i, 🤭=u, 🤮=f, 🥵=g, 🤔=j, 🐰=y, 🤥=v.\n\nSo let's replace each emoji:\n\nn🦁🐶👽 → n o t e (n o t e)\n🐶😍💩🐶 → t h a t (t h a t)\n🐶🐹🦁 → t w o (t w o)\ns🐶🦁r🦆s → s t o r m s (s t o r m s)\n🦁n → o n (o n)\nr👽🤓🦁rd → r e c o r d (r e c o r d)\n😍🤭rr🤩🤓💩n👽 → h u r r i c a n e (h u r r i c a n e)\n💩l🤩🤓👽 → a l i c e (a l i c e)\n🤮r🦁🦆 → f r o m (f r o m)\n🐶😍👽 → t h e (t h e)\n1954 s👽💩s🦁n → 1954 s e a s o n (1954 s e a s o n)\n💩nd → a n d (a n d)\n🐶r🦁p🤩🤓💩l → t r o p i c a l (t r o p i c a l)\ns🐶🦁r🦆 → s t o r m (s t o r m)\n😂👽🐶💩 → 😂 e t a (needs to be a word)\n🤮r🦁🦆 → f r o m (f r o m)\n🐶😍👽 → t h e (t h e)\n2005 s👽💩s🦁n → 2005 s e a s o n (2005 s e a s o n)\n😍💩🤥👽 → h a v e (h a v e)\n🤮🦁r🦆👽d → f o r m e d (f o r m e d)\nd🤭r🤩n🥵 → d u r i n g (d u r i n g)\nd👽🤓👽🦆b👽r → d e c e m b e r (d e c e m b e r)\n💩nd → a n d (a n d)\nl💩s🐶👽d → l a s t e d (l a s t e d)\n🤩n🐶🦁 → i n t o (i n t o)\n🤔💩n🤭💩r🐰 → j a n u a r y (j a n u a r y)\n\nPutting it all together with substitutions:\n\n\"note that two storms on record, hurricane alice from the 1954 season and tropical storm 😂eta from the 2005 season have formed during december and lasted into january.\"\n\nLooking at the part with 😂: \"storm 😂eta\". So \"storm [something]eta\". Let's think about storm names. The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season had a storm named Zeta. But wait, Zeta is a storm name. Let's check: \"storm Zeta\" would fit here. So 😂=z. Because \"😂eta\" would be \"zeta\" if 😂=z. That makes sense. The 2005 season did have Hurricane Zeta. Let me confirm. Yes, Hurricane Zeta was a tropical storm in 2005. So that fits. So the missing emoji 😂 should be z.\n\n\nLet's analyze the encoded sentence using the known mappings from the history and the hint. The confirmed mappings are: 👽=e, 🐶=t, 😍=h, 💩=a, 🦁=o, 🐹=w, 🦆=m, 🤓=c, 🤩=i, 🤭=u, 🤮=f, 🥵=g, 🤔=j, 🐰=y, 🤥=v. The only incorrect emoji from previous guesses is 😂.\n\nSubstituting the known emojis into the encoded sentence, we get:  \n\"note that two storms on record, hurricane alice from the 1954 season and tropical storm 😂eta from the 2005 season have formed during december and lasted into january.\"  \n\nThe phrase \"storm 😂eta\" suggests \"Zeta\" (a tropical storm in the 2005 season). Thus, 😂=z.\n\nAnswer: 👽=e,🐶=t,😍=h,💩=a,🦁=o,🐹=w,🦆=m,🤓=c,🤩=i,🤭=u,🤮=f,😂=z,🤥=v,🥵=g,🤔=j,🐰=y"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The encoded sentence has emojis representing letters, and we know that 👻=t from the hint. Let's start by analyzing the sentence with that in mind.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the occurrences of 👻. The sentence starts with \"🥺n 👻🥶😂...\" so 👻 is t, so that part becomes \"🥺n t🥶😂...\". Let's look for other patterns.\n\nThe next part is \"😱😇🐱🐱 🙄😱 2006\". Maybe \"2006\" is a year, so that's probably unchanged. Then \"🤭😇🐭😂🐮gn🙄 😇nd 🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄\". The \"gn\" at the end of \"🐮gn🙄\" might be part of a word like \"ing\" if the preceding letter is 'i'. So \"🐮gn\" could be \"ing\", making 🐮=i. Let's check that. If 🐮=i, then \"🐮gn\" is \"ing\", so the word would be something like \"XingY\" where X is 🤭😇🐭😂 and Y is 🙄. \n\nThen \"😇nd\" is a common ending, maybe \"and\" since \"nd\" is part of \"and\". So if \"😇nd\" is \"and\", then 😇=a. Let's tentatively say 😇=a. Then \"😇nd\" becomes \"and\". That makes sense.\n\nSo far, 👻=t, 😇=a. Let's check other parts. The word \"👻🥶😂\" with 👻=t could be \"the\" if it's a common word. So t + 🥶 + 😂 = the. Then 🥶=h, 😂=e. Let's test that. If 👻=t, 🥶=h, 😂=e, then \"👻🥶😂\" is \"the\". That's a very common word, so that's likely.\n\nSo now we have 👻=t, 😇=a, 🥶=h, 😂=e. Let's update the sentence with these:\n\nOriginal: 🥺n 👻🥶😂 😱😇🐱🐱 🙄😱 2006, 🤭😇🐭😂🐮gn🙄 😇nd 🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄 🤩😂🐮😂 🥺n🤭🙄🐮🥳🙄🐮😇👻😂d 🥺n👻🙄 👻🥶😂 🐦🧐n🥺🤭🥺🥳😇🐱🥺👻🐼, d😂🐰🥳🥺👻😂 😇n 😇👻👻😂🐦🥳👻 🐻🐼 🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄 👻🙄 🐮😂🐰🥺🐰👻 👻🥶😂 🥺n🤭🙄🐮🥳🙄🐮😇👻🥺🙄n 🥺n 👻🥶😂 🤭🙄🧐🐮👻🐰.\n\nAfter substitutions (👻=t, 😇=a, 🥶=h, 😂=e):\n\n🥺n the 😱a🐱🐱 🙄😱 2006, 🤭a🐭e🐮gn🙄 and 🐻🥺gn a🐰🤭🙄 🤩e🐮e 🥺n🤭🙄🐮🥳🙄🐮a t e d 🥺n t🙄 the 🐦🧐n🥺🤭🥺🥳a🐱🥺t🐼, d e🐰🥳🥺t e an a t t e🐦🥳t 🐻🐼 🐻🥺gn a🐰🤭🙄 t🙄 🐮e🐰🥺🐰t the 🥺n🤭🙄🐮🥳🙄🐮a t🥺🙄n 🥺n the 🤭🙄🧐🐮t🐰.\n\nLooking at \"😱a🐱🐱\". If \"😱a🐱🐱\" is a word, maybe \"that\" (t-h-a-t, but here it's 😱a🐱🐱). Let's see: \"a\" is the second letter, so maybe \"what\" (w-h-a-t), but \"what\" is w h a t. So \"😱a🐱🐱\" could be \"what\" if 😱=w, 🐱=t. Then \"😱a🐱🐱\" becomes \"w a t t\"? No, \"what\" is w h a t. Alternatively, \"that\" is t h a t, but 👻 is t, so \"that\" would be 👻🥶😇👻, which isn't the case here. Let's think again. The structure is [😱][a][🐱][🐱]. Maybe \"ball\" (b-a-l-l), so 🐱=l. Then \"😱a ll\" could be \"call\" (c-a-l-l) if 😱=c. So \"call\" would be c a l l. Let's check that: 😱=c, 🐱=l. Then \"😱a🐱🐱\" is \"call\". That's possible. Then \"🙄😱\" would be \"🙄c\". If \"🙄😱\" is part of a date, like \"in 2006\", maybe \"in 2006\", so \"🙄\" could be 'i' (since \"in\" is i-n, but \"🙄😱\" is 🙄c. \"in 2006\" would have \"in\" as 🙄😱=in. If \"🙄\" is 'i', then \"🙄😱\" is i c? No. Alternatively, \"on 2006\" would be o-n, but 2006 is a year, so maybe \"in 2006\". Let's think of \"🙄😱 2006\" as \"in 2006\", so \"🙄\"=i, \"😱\"=n. Then \"😱a🐱🐱\" would be \"n a 🐱🐱\". \"n a ll\" could be \"n all\"? Maybe \"fall\" (f-a-l-l). If \"😱\"=f, then \"fall\" would be f a l l. So \"😱a🐱🐱\"=fall (f-a-l-l). Then \"🙄😱\" would be \"🙄f\". Maybe \"of 2006\"? \"of\" is o-f. So \"🙄\"=o, \"😱\"=f. Then \"🙄😱\"=of. That could work. So \"of 2006\" would fit. Let's try that: 😱=f, 🙄=o, 🐱=l. Then \"😱a🐱🐱\"=f a l l = fall. \"🙄😱\"=o f = of. So \"fall of 2006\" makes sense. That's a good fit. Let's check:\n\nSo far: 👻=t, 😇=a, 🥶=h, 😂=e, 😱=f, 🙄=o, 🐱=l.\n\nNow the sentence becomes:\n\n🥺n the fall of 2006, 🤭a🐭e🐮gn o and 🐻🥺gn a🐰🤭o 🤩e🐮e 🥺n🤭o🐮🥳o🐮a t e d 🥺n t o the 🐦🧐n🥺🤭🥺🥳a l 🥺t🐼, d e🐰🥳🥺t e an a t t e🐦🥳t 🐻🐼 🐻🥺gn a🐰🤭o t o 🐮e🐰🥺🐰t the 🥺n🤭o🐮🥳o🐮a t🥺o n 🥺n the 🤭o🧐🐮t🐰.\n\nLooking at \"🤭a🐭e🐮gn o\". Let's parse \"🐮gn\" again. If 🐮=i (from earlier thought), then \"i gn\" would be \"ing\". So \"🐮gn\"=ing. Then \"🤭a🐭e ing o\". Maybe \"something o\" like \"something of\"? Let's see: \"something\" is s-o-m-e-t-h-i-n-g. But here \"🤭a🐭e ing\". Let's break it down: [🤭][a][🐭][e][i][n][g] o. So letters: [🤭] a [🐭] e i n g o. Maybe \"something o\" → \"something of\" (since \"of\" is o f, but we have \"o\" here). \"something\" is s o m e t h i n g. Wait, but \"a\" is the second letter here. So \"s a [🐭] e i n g\". That doesn't fit. Maybe \"another\"? \"another\" is a-n-o-t-h-e-r. Not matching. Alternatively, \"change\" → c-h-a-n-g-e. No. Let's think of \"🐮gn\"=ing (so 🐮=i). Then \"🤭a🐭e ing o\" could be \"making of\" (m-a-k-e-i-n-g o-f). Oh! \"making of\" → m a k e i n g o f. Let's check: \"🤭a🐭e ing o\" would be m a k e i n g o f. That fits! So:\n\n🤭=m, 🐭=k, 🐮=i, 🙄=o (already o). So \"🤭a🐭e🐮gn🙄\" becomes m a k e i n g o f. Perfect! That makes sense. So now we have 🤭=m, 🐭=k, 🐮=i.\n\nUpdating the substitutions: 👻=t, 😇=a, 🥶=h, 😂=e, 😱=f, 🙄=o, 🐱=l, 🤭=m, 🐭=k, 🐮=i.\n\nNow the sentence becomes:\n\n🥺n the fall of 2006, making of and 🐻🥺gn a🐰m o 🤩e i e 🥺n m o i 🥳o i a t e d 🥺n t o the 🐦🧐n🥺m 🥺🥳a l 🥺t🐼, d e🐰🥳🥺t e an a t t e🐦🥳t 🐻🐼 🐻🥺gn a🐰m o t o i e🐰🥺🐰t the 🥺n m o i 🥳o i a t🥺o n 🥺n the m o🧐i t🐰.\n\nNext, \"😇nd\" was \"and\" (correct, 😇=a). \"🐻🥺gn a🐰m o\" → [🐻][🥺]gn a [🐰]m o. \"gn\" could be \"ing\" again (g-n), but \"gn\" is part of \"🥺gn\". Let's look at \"🥺gn\". If \"🥺\" is a letter, say 'b', then \"bgn\" could be \"begin\" (b-e-g-i-n). But \"🥺gn\" is [🥺]g n. If \"🥺\"=b, then \"bgn\" is \"bgn\", which isn't a word. Alternatively, \"🥺gn\" could be \"sgn\" (s-g-n) → \"sign\". If \"🥺\"=s, then \"sign\". Let's check. \"🐻🥺gn\" would be [🐻]s i g n (since 🐮=i, but \"gn\" is g-n). Wait, earlier we have \"🐮gn\"=ing (i-n-g?), maybe I mixed up. Wait, \"🐮gn\" was part of \"making\" → m a k e i n g. So \"ing\" is i-n-g. So \"gn\" is n-g. Oh! So \"🐮gn\" is i-n-g. So \"gn\" is n-g. So \"i-n-g\" = 🐮-g-n? Wait, \"making\" is m-a-k-e-i-n-g. So the letters after \"e\" are i-n-g. So \"e🐮gn\" would be e-i-n-g. So \"e🐮gn\"=e-i-n-g=eing. So \"making\" is m-a-k-e-i-n-g → 🤭😇🐭😂🐮gn → m a k e i n g. That's correct. So \"🐮=i\", \"gn\" is n-g. So \"i\" is 🐮, \"n\" is n, \"g\" is g. So \"e i n g\" = 😂🐮gn → e i n g. That makes sense.\n\nSo \"🐻🥺gn a🐰m o\" → [🐻][🥺]n g a [🐰]m o. Let's think of \"a🐰m o\" as \"a [🐰]m o\". Maybe \"a team o\" → \"a team of\"? But \"o\" is of. \"team\" is t-e-a-m. But \"a [🐰]m\" → a [x] m. \"a m x m\"? No. Alternatively, \"a film o\" → \"a film of\". \"film\" is f-i-l-m. But \"a [🐰]m\" → a [x] m. If 🐰=f, then \"a f m\" → a f m, which doesn't make sense. Let's look at another part: \"🥺n the fall...\" → [🥺]n the fall. \"In the fall\" → \"In the fall\". So [🥺]n = In. So \"🥺\"=I (since \"In\" is I-n). So \"🥺n\"=In. That's a good fit! So \"🥺\"=I (capital I, but maybe lowercase). Let's assume \"🥺\"=i (lowercase). Then \"🥺n\"=in. So \"in the fall of 2006\" fits. Let's check:\n\n🥺=i, so \"🥺n\"=in. Now the sentence starts: \"in the fall of 2006, making of and [🐻]i ng a [🐰]m o [🤩]e i e in m o i [🥳]o i a t e d in t o the [🐦][🧐]n i m i [🥳]a l i t [🐼], d e [🐰][🥳]i t e an a t t e [🐦][🥳]t [🐻][🐼] [🐻]i ng a [🐰]m o t o i e [🐰]i [🐰]t the in m o i [🥳]o i a t i o n in the m o [🧐]i t [🐰].\"\n\nWait, \"🥺\"=i, so \"🥺n\"=in. Then \"🐻🥺gn\" becomes [🐻]i n g (since \"gn\" is n-g). So \"i n g\" is ing. So \"🐻i ng\" → [🐻]ing. Maybe \"during\" → d-u-r-i-n-g. So \"during\" would be d [something] i n g. Alternatively, \"string\" → s-t-r-i-n-g. But \"🐻\" is a new emoji. Let's check \"and 🐻i ng a🐰m o\". \"and [🐻]ing a [🐰]mo\". Maybe \"and bringing a demo\". \"demo\" is d-e-m-o. So \"a [🐰]mo\" → a d mo. So \"demo\" → d e m o. But \"a [🐰]mo\" would be a d mo → a demo. So \"🐰\"=d. Let's try that. So \"a🐰m o\" = a d m o = a demo. That works. So \"🐰\"=d. Then \"and [🐻]ing a demo\". \"Bringing\" is b-r-i-n-g-i-n-g. So \"bringing\" → b r i n g i n g. So \"🐻i ng\" would be b r i n g → \"bri ng\"? Maybe \"during\" → d-u-r-i-n-g. \"during\" is d u r i n g. So \"🐻\"=d? But \"d\" is already 🐰=d. So no. Alternatively, \"working\" → w-o-r-k-i-n-g. \"working\" → w o r k i n g. \"🐻i ng\" → w o r i n g? No. Let's check another part.\n\nLooking at \"d😂🐰🥳🥺👻😂\" → d e d [🥳] i t e. \"d e d [🥳] i t e\" → \"dedicated\" maybe? \"dedicated\" is d-e-d-i-c-a-t-e-d. No, but \"d e d [🥳] i t e\" could be \"dedicated\" if [🥳]=c. So \"dedicated\" → d e d c i t e. Not quite. Alternatively, \"determine\" → d-e-t-e-r-m-i-n-e. No. Let's look at \"😇n\" which is \"a n\" → \"an\". Correct. \"😇👻👻😂🐦🥳👻\" → a t t e [🐦][🥳] t. \"att e [🐦][🥳]t\" → \"attend\" (a-t-t-e-n-d) if [🐦]=n, [🥳]=d. So \"att e n d t\"? No. \"attend\" is a-t-t-e-n-d. So \"a t t e n d\" → \"😇👻👻😂🐦🥳\" → a t t e n d. So [🐦]=n, [🥳]=d. Then \"😇👻👻😂🐦🥳👻\" → a t t e n d t. Maybe \"attend to\"? \"attend t\" → attend t. Hmm.\n\nLet's try \"🐦=n\" and \"🥳=d\". Then \"🐦🧐n🥺🤭🥺🥳😇🐱🥺👻🐼\" → n [🧐]n i m i d a l i t [🐼]. \"n [🧐]n i m i d a l i t [🐼]\" → \"n [🧐]n imidalit[🐼]\". Maybe \"nation imidalit...\" → \"national imidalit...\" No. Alternatively, \"n [🧐]n i m i d a l i t [🐼]\" → \"n [🧐]n imidalit[🐼]\". Maybe \"n o n imidalit...\" if [🧐]=o. So \"n o n imidalit...\" → \"non imidalit...\". Not helpful. Let's check \"🤩😂🐮😂\" → [🤩]e i e. \"Maybe \"three\" → t-h-r-e-e. But [🤩]e i e. \"three\" is t-h-r-e-e. So [🤩]=t? But 👻=t. No. \"free\" → f-r-e-e. [🤩]=f? But 😱=f. \"tree\" → t-r-e-e. [🤩]=t. No. \"see\" is s-e-e, but [🤩]e i e. \"series\" → s-e-r-i-e-s. [🤩]e i e → s e i e? No.\n\nLet's recap the substitutions we have so far:\n\n👻=t, 😇=a, 🥶=h, 😂=e, 😱=f, 🙄=o, 🐱=l, 🤭=m, 🐭=k, 🐮=i, 🥺=i (wait, no, \"🥺n\"=in, so 🥺=i). So:\n\n🥺=i, 👻=t, 😇=a, 🥶=h, 😂=e, 😱=f, 🙄=o, 🐱=l, 🤭=m, 🐭=k, 🐮=i.\n\nWait, but \"🐮=i\" and \"🥺=i\" would be a conflict, since each emoji must represent a unique letter. Oh! Right, the problem states \"each letter with a unique emoji\". So I made a mistake earlier. \"🥺\" can't be i if 🐮 is already i. That's a problem. Let's backtrack.\n\nEarlier, \"🥺n the fall...\" → if \"🥺n\" is \"in\", then \"🥺\"=i. But if \"🐮=i\" (from \"making\" → m a k e i n g), then \"🐮\" and \"🥺\" would both be i, which is not allowed. So I need to correct that.\n\nLet's re-examine \"making\". \"making\" is m-a-k-e-i-n-g. So the emojis for \"making\" are 🤭😇🐭😂🐮gn. So:\n\n🤭 = m,\n\n😇 = a,\n\n🐭 = k,\n\n😂 = e,\n\n🐮 = i,\n\ng = g,\n\nn = n.\n\nSo that's correct, each emoji is unique. So \"🐮=i\". Then \"🥺n\" can't be \"in\" because that would make \"🥺=i\" which is the same as \"🐮=i\". So I need to find another word for \"🥺n\". Let's think of \"on the fall of 2006\". So \"🥺n\"=on → \"🥺\"=o. But \"🙄=o\" (from \"of 2006\" where \"🙄😱\"=of → 🙄=o, 😱=f). So \"🥺\" can't be o either. \"At the fall...\" → \"at\" → \"🥺n\"=at → \"🥺\"=a. But \"😇=a\" already. \"By the fall...\" → \"by\" → \"🥺n\"=by → \"🥺\"=b, \"n\"=y. But \"n\" is a letter, so \"n\" would be represented by another emoji. No, the encoded sentence has \"n\" as a letter (like \"🥺n\" has \"n\" as a separate character). Wait, looking at the original encoded sentence: \"🥺n 👻🥶😂...\" The \"n\" here is a letter, not an emoji. Oh! Oh right! The encoded sentence has some letters mixed in. Let me check again. The user wrote: \"Encoded Sentence: 🥺n 👻🥶😂 😱😇🐱🐱 🙄😱 2006, ...\". So \"n\" is a literal letter, not an emoji. Oh! That's a crucial detail I missed. So \"🥺n\" is [emoji] followed by the letter 'n'. So \"🥺\" is an emoji representing a letter, and then 'n' is a letter. So \"🥺n\" is [letter]n, like \"in\" (i + n), \"on\" (o +n), \"an\" (a +n), etc. That changes things. So the 'n' is a regular letter, not part of the emoji code.\n\nSo let's correct that. The \"n\" in \"🥺n\" is a literal 'n', so \"🥺n\" is [emoji] + 'n' → e.g., \"in\" (i +n), \"on\" (o +n), \"an\" (a +n), \"bn\" (b +n), etc.\n\nSo going back, \"👻=t\" (given), \"👻🥶😂\" is t + [emoji] + [emoji] → likely \"the\" (t-h-e), so 🥶=h, 😂=e. That's possible. Then \"👻🥶😂\"=the.\n\nThen \"😱😇🐱🐱 🙄😱 2006\" → [emoji][emoji][emoji][emoji] [emoji][emoji] 2006. Let's assume \"2006\" is a year, so that's unchanged. Let's look at \"🙄😱\" → two emojis, likely a preposition like \"in\" (i-n), \"of\" (o-f), \"on\" (o-n), \"at\" (a-t). Let's say \"of 2006\" → \"of\" is o-f, so 🙄=o, 😱=f. Then \"🙄😱\"=of.\n\nThen \"😱😇🐱🐱\" → f + [emoji] + [emoji] + [emoji]. \"fall\" is f-a-l-l. So if 😇=a (since \"and\" is a common word, and \"😇nd\" could be \"and\"), then \"😱😇🐱🐱\"=f-a-l-l=fall. So 🐱=l. That works. So:\n\n😇=a (since \"😇nd\"=and),\n\n😱=f,\n\n🙄=o,\n\n🐱=l.\n\nSo \"😱😇🐱🐱\"=fall, \"🙄😱\"=of, so \"fall of 2006\" makes sense. Great.\n\nNow, \"🤭😇🐭😂🐮gn🙄\" → [emoji]a[emoji]e[emoji]gn o. Let's parse \"gn\" as part of a word. \"gn\" at the end could be \"ing\" (i-n-g). So [emoji]a[emoji]e[emoji]ing o. Let's think of \"making of\" → m-a-k-e-i-n-g o-f. So:\n\n🤭=m,\n\n🐭=k,\n\n😂=e,\n\n🐮=i,\n\ngn=ng (so 'g' is a letter, 'n' is a letter). So \"🤭😇🐭😂🐮gn🙄\"=m a k e i n g o=making o. But \"of\" is o-f, but here \"🙄\"=o, so \"making of\" would be \"making o f\" but \"🙄\"=o, and \"f\" is 😱=f. So \"making of\" would be \"🤭😇🐭😂🐮gn🙄😱\"=m a k e i n g o f. But in the encoded sentence, it's \"🤭😇🐭😂🐮gn🙄\", which ends with 🙄=o, so maybe \"making o\" as part of a longer phrase. Alternatively, \"taking of\" → t-a-k-e-i-n-g o-f. But 👻=t, so \"taking\" would be 👻... but \"🤭\" is a different emoji.\n\nAlternatively, \"staking of\" → s-t-a-k-e-i-n-g o-f. No, not helpful. Let's proceed with \"making of\" as a possibility, so:\n\n🤭=m,\n\n🐭=k,\n\n🐮=i.\n\nSo \"🤭😇🐭😂🐮gn🙄\"=m a k e i n g o=making o. Then \"😇nd\"=and, which fits. So \"making of and...\" → \"making of and...\".\n\nNext, \"🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄\" → [emoji][emoji]gn a [emoji]m o. \"gn\" again, maybe \"ing\". So [emoji][emoji]ing a [emoji]m o. Let's think \"during a demo\" → d-u-r-i-n-g a d-e-m-o. So \"during a demo\" would be d u r i n g a d e m o. So:\n\n🐻=d,\n\n🥺=u,\n\ngn=ng (i-n-g, but \"i\" is 🐮=i),\n\n🐰=d (but \"d\" is already 🐻=d? No, each emoji is unique. So \"demo\" is d-e-m-o. So \"a [emoji]m o\"=a d m o → a demo. So 🐰=d. Then \"🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄\"=d u i n g a d m o=duing a demo? Not quite. Maybe \"building a demo\" → b-u-i-l-d-i-n-g a d-e-m-o. No, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, \"working a demo\" → w-o-r-k-i-n-g a d-e-m-o. So \"working a demo\" would be w o r k i n g a d e m o. So:\n\n🐻=w,\n\n🥺=o,\n\ngn=ng,\n\n🐰=d.\n\nBut \"🙄=o\" already, so \"🥺\" can't be o. This is getting complicated. Let's look at another part: \"🤩😂🐮😂\" → [emoji]e i e. Maybe \"three\" → t-h-r-e-e. But \"t\" is 👻=t, so [emoji]=t? No. \"free\" → f-r-e-e. [emoji]=f, but \"f\" is 😱=f. \"tree\" → t-r-e-e. [emoji]=t. No. \"series\" → s-e-r-i-e-s. [emoji]=s. So \"s e i e\" → series? No, \"series\" is s-e-r-i-e-s. So [emoji]=s, then \"🤩=s\". So \"s e i e\" → s e i e. Maybe \"seine\" (a type of net), s-e-i-n-e. But \"🤩😂🐮😂\"=s e i e. Close.\n\nLet's try to list all emojis and their possible letters:\n\nEmojis present: 🥺, 👻(t), 🥶, 😂, 😱, 😇, 🐱, 🙄, 🤭, 🐭, 🐮, 🐻, 🐰, 🤩, 🥳, 🐦, 🧐, 🐼, d (but \"d\" is a letter in the encoded sentence, not an emoji).\n\nKnown: 👻=t.\n\nGuesses so far (possible):\n\n👻=t,\n\n🥶=h (if 👻🥶😂=the),\n\n😂=e (same),\n\n😇=a (if 😇nd=and),\n\n😱=f (if 😱😇🐱🐱=fall),\n\n🙄=o (if 🙄😱=of),\n\n🐱=l (same),\n\n🤭=m (if 🤭😇🐭😂🐮gn🙄=making o),\n\n🐭=k (same),\n\n🐮=i (same).\n\nThese are all unique so far. Let's confirm:\n\n👻=t,\n\n🥶=h,\n\n😂=e,\n\n😇=a,\n\n😱=f,\n\n🙄=o,\n\n🐱=l,\n\n🤭=m,\n\n🐭=k,\n\n🐮=i.\n\nNow, the encoded sentence with these substitutions:\n\n🥺n the fall of 2006, making of and 🐻🥺ing a🐰mo 🤩eie 🥺nmo i🥳oiate d 🥺nto the 🐦🧐n🥺m🥺🥳al🥺t🐼, de🐰🥳🥺te an att e🐦🥳t 🐻🐼 🐻🥺ing a🐰mo to ie🐰🥺🐰t the 🥺nmo i🥳oiat🥺on 🥺n the mo🧐it🐰.\n\nLet's look at \"🥺n the fall...\" → [🥺]n the fall. If \"🥺n\" is \"in\" (i+n), then 🥺=i. But we don't have i yet (🐮=i? No, we have 🐮=i. Oh, no, 🐮=i is already an emoji, so 🥺 can't be i. So \"🥺n\" could be \"on\" (o+n), but 🙄=o. \"At\" (a+n) → a is 😇=a. \"By\" (b+n) → b is new. Let's assume \"🥺n\"=in, so 🥺=i (even if 🐮=i? No, each emoji must be unique. So I must have made a mistake with 🐮=i. Let's check \"making\" again. \"making\" is m-a-k-e-i-n-g. The emojis for \"making\" are 🤭😇🐭😂🐮gn. So:\n\n🤭 = m,\n\n😇 = a,\n\n🐭 = k,\n\n😂 = e,\n\n🐮 = i,\n\ng = g,\n\nn = n.\n\nYes, so \"🐮=i\" is correct, and \"🥺\" must be a different letter. Let's try \"🥺n\"=on → \"on the fall of 2006\". So 🥺=o, but 🙄=o. Can't be. \"At the fall...\" → \"at\" → \"🥺n\"=at → 🥺=a, but 😇=a. \"By the fall...\" → \"by\" → \"🥺n\"=by → 🥺=b, n=y. But \"n\" is a letter, not an emoji. So \"n\" is just 'n', so \"🥺n\" is [emoji] + 'n' → [letter]n. So \"in\" (i +n), \"on\" (o +n), \"an\" (a +n), \"bn\" (b +n), \"cn\" (c +n), etc.\n\nLet's try \"🥺=s\", so \"🥺n\"=sn. Not a common word. \"🥺=b\", \"bn\" → \"bn\" is not common. \"🥺=c\", \"cn\" → \"cn\" (abbreviation for China, but unlikely). \"🥺=d\", \"dn\" → \"dn\" (data network, no). \"🥺=g\", \"gn\" → \"gn\" (like \"gnu\", but \"gn the fall\" doesn't make sense). \"🥺=h\", \"hn\" → no. \"🥺=j\", \"jn\" → no. \"🥺=k\", \"kn\" → \"kn\" (like \"knee\" but \"kn the fall\" no). \"🥺=l\", \"ln\" → no. \"🥺=p\", \"pn\" → no. \"🥺=q\", \"qn\" → no. \"🥺=r\", \"rn\" → \"rn\" (registered nurse, no). \"🥺=s\", \"sn\" → \"sn\" (snake, no). \"🥺=t\", \"tn\" → \"tn\" (Tennessee, no). \"🥺=u\", \"un\" → \"un the fall\" → \"un the fall\" (unlikely). \"🥺=v\", \"vn\" → no. \"🥺=w\", \"wn\" → no. \"🥺=x\", \"xn\" → no. \"🥺=y\", \"yn\" → no. \"🥺=z\", \"zn\" → no.\n\nHmm, maybe \"🥺n\" is part of a name or a proper noun. Alternatively, maybe \"👻🥶😂\" isn't \"the\". Let's consider other possibilities. \"👻=t\", so \"t\" + 🥶 + 😂. \"t\" + \"h\" + \"e\" is \"the\", which is the most common 3-letter word. So that's still likely.\n\nLet's look at \"d😂🐰🥳🥺👻😂\" → d + 😂 + 🐰 + 🥳 + 🥺 + 👻 + 😂. With 😂=e, 👻=t, this is d + e + 🐰 + 🥳 + 🥺 + t + e. Maybe \"dedicated\" → d-e-d-i-c-a-t-e-d. No, but \"d e [🐰][🥳][🥺]t e\". \"determine\" → d-e-t-e-r-m-i-n-e. No. \"deliver\" → d-e-l-i-v-e-r. No.\n\nAnother part: \"😇n\" → 😇=a, so \"a n\" → \"an\". Correct. \"😇👻👻😂🐦🥳👻\" → a + t + t + e + 🐦 + 🥳 + t. \"attend t\" → \"attend to\"? If \"attend\" is a-t-t-e-n-d, then 🐦=n, 🥳=d. So \"a t t e n d t\" → \"attend t\". Maybe \"attend the\" → \"attend the\", but \"the\" is 👻🥶😂=t h e.\n\nPutting it all together, the most confident substitutions are the ones that fit common words: 👻=t, 🥶=h, 😂=e (the), 😇=a (and), 😱=f, 🙄=o (of), 🐱=l (fall), 🤭=m, 🐭=k, 🐮=i (making). These all fit and are unique. Even if some parts are unclear, these are the most probable guesses for the first attempt.\n\n👻=t, 🥶=h, 😂=e, 😇=a, 😱=f, 🙄=o, 🐱=l, 🤭=m, 🐭=k, 🐮=i\n\nAnswer: 👻=t, 🥶=h, 😂=e, 😇=a, 😱=f, 🙄=o, 🐱=l, 🤭=m, 🐭=k, 🐮=i","Okay, let's try to figure out the emojis based on the given information. First, the encoded sentence is provided, and we have some correct emojis from the first attempt. Let's list out the correct ones first from the feedback:\n\nFrom the history, the first guess had some correct: 👻=t (correct), 🥶=h (correct), 😂=e (correct), 😇=a (correct), 😱=f (correct), 🙄=o (correct), 🐱=l (correct). The ones that were wrong are 🤭, 🐭, 🐮.\n\nSo let's start by substituting the known emojis into the encoded sentence to see what words we can get. Let's replace each known emoji with their letters:\n\nEncoded Sentence (after substitution):\n🥺n t h e f a l l o 2006, 🤭a 🐭e 🐮gn o a n d 🐻🥺gn a 🐰🤭o 🤩e 🐮e 🥺n🤭o 🐮🥳o 🐮a t e d 🥺n t o t h e 🐦🧐n🥺🤭🥺🥳a l 🥺t 🐼, d e 🐰🥳🥺t e a n d a t t e 🐦🥳t 🐻🐼 🐻🥺gn a 🐰🤭o t o 🐮e 🐰🥺🐰t t h e 🥺n🤭o 🐮🥳o 🐮a t 🥺o n 🥺n t h e 🤭o 🧐🐮t 🐰.\n\nLet's break down parts of this to look for words. Let's start with the first part: \"🥺n t h e f a l l o 2006\" — \"fall o 2006\" — \"fall o 2006\" might be \"fall of 2006\"? Because \"o\" is 🙄=o, so \"fall o\" could be \"fall of\". That would make sense. So \"fall of 2006\" — so the part before that is \"🥺n t h e f a l l o 2006\" — \"the fall of 2006\" — so \"🥺n\" might be \"In\" because \"In the fall of 2006\". So \"🥺n\" = \"In\" → \"🥺\" would be \"I\" (since \"n\" is the next letter). So 🥺=I. Let's check that. So \"🥺n\" becomes \"In\" if 🥺=I. That makes sense. Let's note that: 🥺=I.\n\nNext, \"🤭a 🐭e 🐮gn o\" — after \"2006,\" so maybe a sentence like \"many ... ing of\". Let's see. The part after \"2006,\" is \"🤭a 🐭e 🐮gn o\" — \"o\" is \"of\". So \"🐮gn o\" could be \"ing of\" (since \"ing\" is a common suffix). So \"🐮gn\" = \"ing\" → \"🐮\" is \"i\" (since \"g\" is next, \"n\" is next). Wait, \"gn\" would be \"gn\" in \"ing\". Let's see: \"ing\" is i-n-g. Oh, \"🐮gn\" — if \"gn\" is \"ng\", then \"🐮\" would be \"i\". Because \"ing\" is i-ng. So \"i\" + \"ng\" = \"ing\". So \"🐮gn\" = \"ing\" → 🐮=i. But in the first guess, 🐮 was guessed as \"i\" and the feedback was False. Oh, that's a problem. Because the first guess had 🐮=i and feedback said False. So maybe that's not right. Let's check again.\n\nWait, maybe \"🐮gn\" is \"ong\" or \"ang\"? Let's see. Let's look at another part. The sentence has \"a n d\" (since 😇=a, so \"a n d\" would be \"and\" — correct. So \"a n d\" is \"and\". Then \"🐻🥺gn a 🐰🤭o\". Let's substitute 🥺=I (if that's correct). So \"🐻I gn a 🐰🤭o\". \"gn\" could be \"gn\" as in \"sign\" (s-i-g-n) but maybe \"I gn\" could be \"Ign\" as in \"Ignore\" or \"Ign...\". Let's see.\n\nAnother part: \"🤩e 🐮e\" — \"🤩e 🐮e\". If 😂=e, then \"🤩e\" is a word ending with e, and \"🐮e\" is another. Maybe \"these\" or \"there\"? But \"🤩\" is unknown. Let's check the next part: \"🥺n🤭o 🐮🥳o 🐮a t e d\" — \"In 🤭o 🐮🥳o 🐮a ted\". \"ted\" at the end is a common past tense suffix. \"In ... ited\" maybe? Like \"Inited\" but that's not a word. Or \"In ... ated\" (like \"inated\")? Let's see. \"🐮a t e d\" — \"🐮a ted\". If \"ted\" is \"ted\", then \"🐮a\" could be \"in\" (so \"in ted\" → \"inted\" but not a word) or \"an\" (anted). Maybe \"🐮\" is \"s\" → \"sated\"? \"s a ted\" → \"sated\" (sated is a word: past tense of sate). So \"sated\". If \"🐮\" is \"s\", then \"🐮a\" is \"sa\". That could work. But earlier guess had 🐮=i, which was wrong, so maybe \"s\" is possible.\n\nLet's go back to the first part: \"🥺n t h e f a l l o 2006\" — \"In the fall of 2006\" (if 🥺=I, then \"🥺n\"=In). That makes sense. So \"In the fall of 2006\" — that's a plausible start. So 🥺=I seems correct.\n\nNext part: \"🤭a 🐭e 🐮gn o\" — after \"2006,\". Let's say \"In the fall of 2006, [something]\". \"🤭a\" could be \"many\" (m-a-n-y, but 🤭 was guessed as m and feedback was False). Oh, in the first guess, 🤭 was guessed as m and feedback was False. So \"🤭a\" can't be \"ma\". What else? \"B a\" → \"ba\" (maybe \"ban\" if next letters). \"Fa\" → \"fa\" (fan). \"Ka\" → \"ka\" (kar). \"Sa\" → \"sa\" (sad). Let's see the next part: \"🐭e\". If \"🐭e\" is \"ke\" (if 🐭=k, but first guess had 🐭=k and feedback was False), so that's out. Maybe \"le\" (🐭=l, but 🐱=l already, so emojis are unique). \"Be\" (🐭=b). \"De\" (d). \"Se\" (s). \"Re\" (r). \"Te\" (t, but 👻=t). \"We\" (w). \"Ye\" (y). Let's think of \"🤭a 🐭e 🐮gn o\" as a noun phrase. Maybe \"some event of\"? Let's see: \"some\" would be s-o-m-e, but \"🤭a\" would need to be \"so\" if 🤭=s and \"a\" is a. Wait, \"so\" is s-o, but \"🤭a\" is \"🤭\"+a. If \"so\" is \"s o\", but \"a\" is a. Maybe \"something else\". Let's try another part.\n\nLooking at \"a n d\" → \"and\". Then \"🐻🥺gn a 🐰🤭o\" — \"and [something] a [something] 🤭o\". Let's substitute 🥺=I: \"🐻I gn a 🐰🤭o\". \"I gn\" could be \"ign\" as in \"ignore\" (i-g-n-o-r-e). If \"🐻I gn\" is \"ignore\", then \"🐻\" would be \"g\" (since \"g\" + \"I\" + \"gn\" → \"gI gn\" → \"ignore\"? No, \"ignore\" is i-g-n-o-r-e. So \"I\" (🥺) would be \"i\" in \"ignore\". So \"ignore\" is i-g-n-o-r-e. So \"🐻🥺gn\" → \"i-g-n\" (if 🐻=g, 🥺=i, then \"g i gn\" → \"gign\"? No. Maybe \"🐻🥺gn\" is \"sign\" (s-i-g-n). If \"sign\", then \"🐻\" would be s, 🥺=i, \"gn\"=gn. So \"sign a 🐰🤭o\". \"sign a [something] 🤭o\". Maybe \"sign a contract\" → but \"contract\" is longer. Or \"sign a document\". Let's see \"🤭o\" — if \"o\" is \"o\", maybe \"document\" → \"doc\" but \"🤭o\" would be \"do\" (if 🤭=d). So \"sign a document\" → \"sign a doc...\" but not sure.\n\nAnother part: \"🤩e 🐮e\" — \"🤩e 🐮e\". If \"e\" is \"e\", maybe \"these\" (t-h-e-s-e) but 👻=t, 🥶=h, so \"these\" would be t-h-e-s-e. But \"🤩e\" would be \"se\" (s-e) if 🤩=s. Then \"🐮e\" could be \"ve\" (v-e) → \"se ve\"? Not a word. Or \"they\" (t-h-e-y) but \"🤩e\" would be \"he\" (h-e) but 🥶=h. \"The\" is t-h-e, but \"🤩e\" would be \"te\" (t-e) but 👻=t. Maybe \"those\" (t-h-o-s-e) → \"o\" is 🙄=o. So \"those\" is t-h-o-s-e. So \"🤩e\" could be \"se\" (s-e). So \"se\" + \"🐮e\" → \"se ve\"? Maybe \"seven\" but that's s-e-v-e-n. Not sure.\n\nLet's check \"d e 🐰🥳🥺t e\" — \"de 🐰🥳It e\" (if 🥺=I). \"de\" could be \"de\" as in \"debt\" or \"desk\". \"It e\" → \"ite\" (like \"site\"). Maybe \"defeat\" → \"defeat\" is d-e-f-e-a-t. But \"a\" is 😇=a, so \"defeat\" would be d-e-f-e-a-t. Let's see: \"d e 🐰🥳🥺t e\" → \"d e [something] I t e\". \"defeat\" would be d-e-f-e-a-t. But \"I t e\" would be \"i t e\" which isn't part of \"defeat\". Maybe \"debate\" → d-e-b-a-t-e. \"a\" is 😇=a. So \"d e 🐰🥳🥺t e\" → \"d e b [something] i t e\". Hmm, not sure.\n\nLooking at \"a n d a t t e 🐦🥳t\" — \"and atte 🐦🥳t\". \"atte\" could be \"atte\" as in \"attempt\" (a-t-t-e-m-p-t). So \"attempt\" would be a-t-t-e-m-p-t. So \"atte\" is a-t-t-e. Then \"🐦🥳t\" would be \"mpt\" (m-p-t). So \"🐦\"=m, 🥳=p. Let's check: \"atte\" + \"mpt\" → \"attempt\". That works! So \"a t t e m p t\" → \"attempt\". So \"🐦=m\" and \"🥳=p\". Let's verify: \"atte\" is a-t-t-e (correct, since 😇=a, 👻=t, 😂=e), then \"🐦🥳t\" would be m-p-t. So \"mpt\" → \"mpt\" in \"attempt\". So \"🐦=m\" and \"🥳=p\". That's a good lead. Let's note that: 🐦=m, 🥳=p.\n\nLet's check that part again: \"a n d a t t e 🐦🥳t\" → \"and atte mpt\" → \"and attempt\". That makes sense. So that's a hit. So 🐦=m, 🥳=p.\n\nNow, let's go back to \"🐻🥺gn a 🐰🤭o\". If \"atte mpt\" is \"attempt\", then \"and attempt\" is correct. Let's look at \"🐻🥺gn a 🐰🤭o\". With 🥺=I, and \"gn\" maybe part of \"sign\" (s-i-g-n). If \"🐻=s\", then \"s I g n\" → \"sign\". So \"sign a 🐰🤭o\". \"sign a contract\" → \"contract\" would be c-o-n-t-r-a-c-t, but \"🤭o\" would be \"co\" (c-o) if 🤭=c. So \"sign a contract\" → \"sign a contract\". Let's see: \"🐰🤭o\" → \"tr co\" (if 🐰=t, 🤭=c, 🙄=o). But \"tr co\" doesn't make sense. Alternatively, \"sign a document\" → \"document\" is d-o-c-u-m-e-n-t. \"🤭o\" would be \"do\" (d-o) if 🤭=d. So \"sign a document\" → \"sign a document\". Then \"🐰\" would be \"c\" (so \"doc\" → d-o-c). So \"🐰🤭o\" → \"c d o\" → no. Maybe \"sign a paper\". \"paper\" is p-a-p-e-r. \"a 🐰🤭o\" → \"a p ... o\". If \"🐰=p\", then \"a p 🤭o\". \"paper\" would be p-a-p-e-r, but \"o\" is at the end. Not matching.\n\nAnother part: \"t o t h e\" — \"the\" is t-h-e, so \"t o t h e\" → \"to the\". That makes sense. So \"In the fall of 2006, [something], and [something] to the [something]\".\n\nLooking at \"🐻🐼\" — \"🐻🐼\" could be \"it\" (if 🐻=i, 🐼=t) but 👻=t already. Or \"is\" (i-s). Maybe \"it\" but t is taken. \"He\" (h-e) but 🥶=h, 😂=e. \"She\" (s-h-e). \"They\" (t-h-e-y). \"We\" (w-e). \"You\" (y-o-u). \"It\" (i-t). \"That\" (t-h-a-t). Let's see where \"🐻🐼\" is: \"🐻🐼 🐻🥺gn a 🐰🤭o\" — \"🐻🐼 sign a ...\". Maybe \"it sign a...\" → \"it sign a...\" but \"it\" would need 🐻=i, 🐼=t. But 👻=t, so maybe 🐼 is another letter. Alternatively, \"it\" is i-t, but 👻=t, so maybe 🐼=t is not allowed (since each emoji is unique). So \"🐻🐼\" could be \"as\" (a-s). \"as sign a...\" → \"as sign a...\".\n\nLet's look at \"t h e 🐦🧐n🥺🤭🥺🥳a l 🥺t 🐼\" — \"the m 🧐n I 🤭I p a l I t 🐼\". \"the m [something]n I [something] I p a l I t [something]\". \"pal\" is p-a-l (since 🥳=p, 😇=a, 🐱=l). So \"a l\" → \"al\" (as in \"pal\"). So \"the m [something]n I [something] I p a l I t [something]\". Maybe \"the main issue in the policy\". Let's see: \"main\" is m-a-i-n. \"the m a i n\" → \"the main\". So \"🐦🧐n\" → \"m a i n\" → \"m\" (🐦=m), \"🧐=a\", \"n\" (n). But 😇=a, so \"a\" is already taken by 😇. So \"🧐=a\" would conflict. Alternatively, \"mean\" (m-e-a-n). \"the m e a n\" → \"the mean\". \"e\" is 😂=e, \"a\"=😇=a. So \"🐦🧐n\" → m e a n → \"m\" (🐦=m), \"🧐=e\" (but 😂=e, so conflict). \"moon\" (m-o-o-n). \"the m o o n\" → \"the moon\". \"o\" is 🙄=o. So \"🐦🧐n\" → m o o n → \"m\" (🐦=m), \"🧐=o\" (but 🙄=o, conflict). \"mile\" (m-i-l-e) but \"n\" at the end. \"mint\" (m-i-n-t). \"the m i n t\" → \"the mint\". \"i\" could be from 🥺=I (since \"I\" is \"i\"). So \"🐦🧐n\" → m i n t → \"m\" (🐦=m), \"🧐=i\" (since \"i\" is \"I\" from 🥺=I). But \"i\" would be represented by 🥺=I. So \"🧐n\" → \"i n\" → \"in\". So \"the m i n t\" → \"the mint\". Then \"🥺🤭🥺🥳a l\" → \"I 🤭 I p a l\" → \"I [something] I pal\". \"pal\" is \"pal\" (p-a-l). So \"I [something] I pal\" → \"I [something] I pal\". Maybe \"I check I pal\" (but not making sense). Alternatively, \"issue\" → \"issue\" is i-s-s-u-e. \"🥺🤭🥺🥳\" → \"I 🤭 I p\" → \"I [something] I p\". Maybe \"I miss up\" → but \"p\" is 🥳=p. Not sure.\n\nLet's look at \"d e 🐰🥳🥺t e\" → \"d e 🐰p I t e\". \"de\" could be \"de\", \"p I t e\" → \"pite\". \"depite\" → \"despite\" (d-e-s-p-i-t-e). Oh! \"despite\" is d-e-s-p-i-t-e. Let's check: \"d e 🐰p I t e\" → \"d e s p i t e\" → \"despite\". So \"🐰=s\" (since \"s\" is needed here). So \"🐰=s\". That would make sense. So \"d e s p i t e\" → \"despite\". So \"🐰=s\". Let's note that: 🐰=s.\n\nSo \"d e 🐰p I t e\" → \"despite\". That works! So 🐰=s.\n\nNow, \"a n d a t t e m p t\" → \"and attempt\" (since 🐦=m, 🥳=p). That makes sense. So \"and attempt\" is correct.\n\nLet's go back to \"🐻🥺gn a 🐰🤭o\" → \"🐻I gn a s 🤭o\". If \"despite\" is correct, then \"and [something] a s 🤭o\". Let's think of \"and design a scope\". \"design\" is d-e-s-i-g-n. But \"🐻I gn\" → \"🐻 I g n\" → \"design\" would be d-e-s-i-g-n. So \"🐻=d\", \"I=e\"? Wait, but we thought 🥺=I (i) earlier. Let's check: \"design\" is d-e-s-i-g-n. So \"d e s i g n\". If \"🐻=d\", \"🥺=e\", then \"d e s i g n\" → \"🐻🥺sI gn\". No, the original is \"🐻🥺gn\" → \"🐻🥺g n\". So \"gn\" is \"gn\" in \"design\". \"design\" is d-e-s-i-g-n. So \"d e s i g n\" → \"d e s i g n\". So \"🐻🥺gn\" → \"d e g n\" → no. Alternatively, \"assign\" (a-s-s-i-g-n). \"assign\" is a-s-s-i-g-n. So \"a s s i g n\". But \"a\" is 😇=a, \"s\" is 🐰=s. So \"a s s i g n\" → \"a s s I g n\" (since 🥺=I). So \"a s s I g n\" → \"assign\". Then \"🐻🥺gn\" → \"s I g n\" (since \"assign\" is a-s-s-i-g-n). So \"s I g n\" → \"sign\". \"assign a s 🤭o\" → \"assign a s [something] o\". Maybe \"assign a scope\" → \"scope\" is s-c-o-p-e. \"o\" is 🙄=o. So \"scope\" is s-c-o-p-e. So \"s 🤭o\" → \"s c o\" → \"sco\" (part of \"scope\"). So \"🤭=c\". Let's check: \"s c o\" → \"sco\" (scope). So \"🤭=c\". Then \"assign a scope\" → \"assign a scope\". That makes sense. Let's verify:\n\n\"🐻🥺gn\" → \"s I g n\" → \"sign\" (if 🐻=s, 🥺=I). Then \"a s 🤭o\" → \"a s c o\" → \"asco\"? No, \"assign a scope\" would be \"assign a scope\". \"assign\" is a-s-s-i-g-n. So \"a s s I g n\" → \"a s s I g n\". So \"a s s I g n a s c o p e\" → \"assign a scope\". But the original part is \"🐻🥺gn a 🐰🤭o\" → \"s I g n a s c o\". \"sign a sco\" → \"sign a sco...\" which could be \"sign a scope\". That's plausible. So \"🤭=c\".\n\nLet's check if \"🤭=c\" fits elsewhere. Let's look at \"🤭a 🐭e 🐮gn o\" — \"c a 🐭e 🐮gn o\". \"ca\" could be \"ca\" as in \"case\". \"case\" is c-a-s-e. So \"c a s e\" → \"case\". So \"🐭e\" would need to be \"s e\" (since \"case\" is c-a-s-e). So \"🐭=s\" but 🐰=s already (since we thought 🐰=s). So that's a conflict. Alternatively, \"call\" (c-a-l-l) but \"e\" is next. \"came\" (c-a-m-e). So \"c a m e\" → \"came\". So \"🐭e\" would be \"m e\" (if 🐭=m). But \"m\" is 🐦=m (since we thought 🐦=m). So \"🐭=m\" would conflict. \"cake\" (c-a-k-e). So \"c a k e\" → \"cake\". So \"🐭e\" would be \"k e\" (if 🐭=k). But in the first guess, 🐭 was guessed as k and feedback was False. So that's not possible. \"cave\" (c-a-v-e). So \"c a v e\" → \"cave\". So \"🐭e\" would be \"v e\" (🐭=v). That's possible. So \"c a v e 🐮gn o\" → \"cave [something] of\". \"cave in of\" → \"cave in of\" doesn't make sense. \"cave song of\" → \"cave song of\". \"song\" is s-o-n-g. So \"🐮gn\" → \"s o n g\" → \"🐮=s\" (but \"s\" is 🐰=s, conflict). \"song\" is s-o-n-g. Alternatively, \"cave sing of\" → \"sing\" is s-i-n-g. \"🐮gn\" → \"s i n g\" → \"🐮=s\" (conflict again). \n\nLet's try another angle. The first part of the encoded sentence: \"🥺n 👻🥶😂 😱😇🐱🐱 🙄😱 2006\" — substituting knowns: \"🥺n t h e f a l l o 2006\". We thought \"🥺n\" is \"In\", so \"In the fall o 2006\" → \"In the fall of 2006\". That works. So \"🙄😱\" is \"o f\" → \"of\". Which matches 🙄=o and 😱=f (since the feedback said 😱=f is correct). So \"🙄😱\" = \"of\" → correct. So that part is confirmed.\n\nAnother part: \"🤭😇🐭😂🐮gn🙄\" — \"🤭a 🐭e 🐮gn o\". If \"of 2006, [something]\" — \"In the fall of 2006, [something]\". Let's assume \"something\" is a noun phrase. Let's say \"In the fall of 2006, [a certain event]\". \"a certain event\" would be \"a certain event\". \"a\" is 😇=a. \"certain\" is c-e-r-t-a-i-n. \"event\" is e-v-e-n-t. Let's see: \"🤭a 🐭e 🐮gn o\" → \"c a r e i gn o\" → \"care ign o\" → no. \"c a v e s gn o\" → \"cave sgn o\" → no. \n\nLet's look at \"🐮😂🐮😂\" — \"🐮e 🐮e\". If \"🐮=v\", then \"v e v e\" → \"veve\" (not a word). \"🐮=b\" → \"b e b e\" → \"bebe\" (baby in Spanish, but not English). \"🐮=s\" → \"s e s e\" → \"ses e\" → \"sees e\"? \"sees\" is s-e-e-s. So \"s e e s\" → \"sees\". So \"🐮e 🐮e\" → \"s e s e\" → not \"sees\". \"sees\" would be \"s e e s\", so \"🐮=s\" and \"🐮e 🐮e\" would need to be \"s e e s\" → but that's two \"e\"s (😂=e). So \"s e e s\" → \"sees\" would be \"🐮😂😂🐮\" → \"s e e s\". But the original is \"🐮😂🐮😂\" → \"s e s e\". Not matching. \"then\" → t-h-e-n, but \"🐮e\" would be \"he\" (h-e) → \"h e h e\" → \"hehe\". \"them\" → t-h-e-m. \"🐮e\" → \"he\" → \"he he\" → \"hehe\". \"they\" → t-h-e-y. \"🐮e\" → \"he\" → \"he he\". \"have\" → h-a-v-e. \"🐮e\" → \"ve\" → \"ve ve\" → \"veve\". \"give\" → g-i-v-e. \"🐮e\" → \"ve\" → \"ve ve\". \n\nLet's go back to \"🥺n🤭🙄🐮🥳🙄🐮😇👻😂d\" — \"In 🤭o 🐮p o 🐮a t e d\". \"In [something] op [something] ated\". \"Incorporated\" → \"incorporated\" is i-n-c-o-r-p-o-r-a-t-e-d. Let's check: \"In c o r p o r a t e d\" → \"Incorporated\". So \"In 🤭o 🐮p o 🐮a t e d\" → \"In c o r p o r a t e d\" → \"Incorporated\". That's a perfect fit! Let's break it down:\n\n\"🥺n\" = \"In\" → 🥺=I.\n\n\"🤭🙄\" = \"co\" → 🤭=c, 🙄=o (which is correct, 🙄=o).\n\n\"🐮🥳\" = \"rp\" → 🐮=r, 🥳=p (since \"rp\" is part of \"corporate\").\n\n\"🙄\" = \"o\" → correct.\n\n\"🐮😇\" = \"ra\" → 🐮=r, 😇=a (correct, 😇=a).\n\n\"👻😂\" = \"te\" → 👻=t, 😂=e (correct).\n\n\"d\" = \"d\".\n\nSo putting it all together: \"In c o r p o r a t e d\" → \"Incorporated\". That's a perfect match! So this gives us several emojis:\n\n- 🤭=c (since \"🤭🙄\" = \"co\").\n- 🐮=r (since \"🐮🥳\" = \"rp\" → r-p, and \"🐮😇\" = \"ra\" → r-a).\n- 🥳=p (since \"🥳\" is p in \"rp\").\n\nLet's verify this:\n\n\"🥺n🤭🙄🐮🥳🙄🐮😇👻😂d\" → \"In c o r p o r a t e d\" → \"Incorporated\". Yes! That's exactly it. So this gives us:\n\n🥺=I, 🤭=c, 🐮=r, 🥳=p.\n\nLet's check if these fit with previous feedback. In the first guess, 🤭 was guessed as m (feedback False), which is correct because now we have 🤭=c. 🐮 was guessed as i (feedback False), correct, now 🐮=r. 🥳 wasn't guessed before, so new.\n\nNow let's check other parts with these new emojis.\n\nThe part \"🤭😇🐭😂🐮gn🙄\" → \"c a 🐭e r gn o\". \"In the fall of 2006, c a 🐭e r gn o\". \"In the fall of 2006, [something]\". Let's see \"c a 🐭e r gn o\" → \"ca[something]er gno\". Maybe \"candidate r gno\" → no. \"caliber gno\" → \"caliber\" is c-a-l-i-b-e-r. \"c a l i b e r\" → \"ca[something]er\". So \"🐭e\" would be \"l i\" (if 🐭=l, but 🐱=l already). No. \"caterer\" → c-a-t-e-r-e-r. \"c a t e r e r\" → \"ca t e r e r\". So \"🐭e\" would be \"t e\" (🐭=t, but 👻=t). No. \"carrier\" → c-a-r-r-i-e-r. \"c a r r i e r\" → \"ca r r i e r\". So \"🐭e\" would be \"r i\" (🐭=r, but 🐮=r). No. \"captive\" → c-a-p-t-i-v-e. \"c a p t i v e\" → \"ca p t i v e\". \"🐭e\" would be \"p t\" (no). \n\nAnother part: \"🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄\" → \"🐻I gn a s c o\". \"Incorporated\" was part of the sentence, so \"and [something]\". Let's say \"and [something]\". \"🐻I gn a s c o\" → \"s I gn a s c o\" (if 🐻=s) → \"sign a scope\". \"sign a scope\" makes sense. So \"sign a scope\" → \"s I g n a s c o p e\" (if 🥳=p, then \"scope\" is s c o p e). So \"🐻=s\". Let's check:\n\n\"🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄\" → \"s I g n a s c o\" → \"sign a sco\" (which is part of \"scope\"). That's plausible. So \"🐻=s\".\n\nNow, \"🐻🐼\" → \"s 🐼\". Let's look at the part \"🐻🐼 🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄\" → \"s 🐼 sign a sco\". Maybe \"it sign a sco\" → \"it\" would need 🐼=i, but 🥺=I (i) already. \"as sign a sco\" → \"as\" would be a-s. \"a\" is 😇=a, \"s\" is 🐰=s. So \"a s\" → \"as\". So \"🐻🐼\" → \"a s\" → \"as\". So \"🐼=a\"? But 😇=a already. No. \"so sign a sco\" → \"so\" is s-o. \"o\" is 🙄=o. So \"s o\" → \"so\". So \"🐻🐼\" → \"s o\" → \"so\". So \"🐼=o\" but 🙄=o. Conflict. \"in sign a sco\" → \"in\" is i-n. \"i\" is 🥺=I, \"n\" is n. So \"i n\" → \"in\". \"🐻🐼\" → \"i n\" → \"in\". So \"🐼=n\". Let's check: \"s 🐼\" → \"s n\" → \"sn\" which is not \"in\". Hmm.\n\nLet's check \"d😂🐰🥳🥺👻😂\" → \"d e s p I t e\" → \"despite\" (as we thought earlier). Yes! \"d e s p I t e\" → \"despite\". So that part is correct. \"despite\" is d-e-s-p-i-t-e. So:\n\nd (given as d), 😂=e, 🐰=s, 🥳=p, 🥺=I (i), 👻=t, 😂=e. So that's \"despite\". Perfect! So 🐰=s is correct.\n\nAnother part: \"😇n 😇👻👻😂🐦🥳👻\" → \"a n a t t e m p t\" → \"and attempt\" (since 😇=a, n is n, 😇=a, 👻=t, 👻=t, 😂=e, 🐦=m, 🥳=p, 👻=t). So \"a n a t t e m p t\" → \"and attempt\". Correct. So that part is \"and attempt\".\n\nNow, \"🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄\" → \"s I g n a s c o\" → \"sign a sco\" (as in \"scope\"). \"scope\" is s-c-o-p-e. So \"sco\" is the start. So \"sign a scope\" makes sense.\n\nThe part \"👻🙄 🐮😂🐰🥺🐰👻\" → \"t o r e s I s t\". \"t o r e s I s t\" → \"tore sist\"? No. \"t o r e s i s t\" → \"resist\" is r-e-s-i-s-t. So \"t o r e s i s t\" → \"to resist\". Yes! \"to resist\" is t-o-r-e-s-i-s-t. Let's break it down:\n\n👻🙄 → t o (👻=t, 🙄=o).\n\n🐮😂 → r e (🐮=r, 😂=e).\n\n🐰🥺 → s I (🐰=s, 🥺=I).\n\n🐰👻 → s t (🐰=s, 👻=t).\n\nSo \"t o r e s I s t\" → \"to resist\". \"resist\" is r-e-s-i-s-t. So \"r e s i s t\" → \"r e s I s t\" (since 🥺=I=i). So \"to resist\" is correct. That fits! So \"👻🙄 🐮😂🐰🥺🐰👻\" → \"to resist\". Perfect.\n\nNow, \"👻🥶😂\" → \"t h e\" (👻=t, 🥶=h, 😂=e) → \"the\". Correct.\n\n\"🥺n👻🙄\" → \"In t o\" → \"In to\" → \"Into\". Yes! \"Into\" is I-n-t-o. So \"🥺n👻🙄\" → \"I n t o\" → \"Into\". Correct. So \"Into the...\" makes sense.\n\nPutting it all together, let's list all the emojis we have so far:\n\n- 👻=t (correct)\n- 🥶=h (correct)\n- 😂=e (correct)\n- 😇=a (correct)\n- 😱=f (correct)\n- 🙄=o (correct)\n- 🐱=l (correct)\n- 🥺=I (i)\n- 🤭=c\n- 🐮=r\n- 🥳=p\n- 🐰=s\n- 🐦=m (from \"attempt\" → \"m\" in \"mpt\")\n- 🐻=s? Wait, earlier we thought \"🐻=s\" but \"🐰=s\" already. Oh no, conflict. Because \"🐰=s\" and if \"🐻=s\", that's a problem. So I must have made a mistake there. Let's correct that.\n\nWait, \"🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄\" → \"🐻 I g n a s c o\". If \"sign a scope\" is \"s i g n a s c o p e\", then \"🐻=s\" would require \"s i g n\", but \"s\" is already 🐰=s. So that's a conflict. So maybe \"🐻\" is another letter. Let's re-examine \"resist\" part: \"🐮😂🐰🥺🐰👻\" → \"r e s I s t\" → \"resist\" (correct). So \"🐮=r\" is correct. \n\nLet's check \"🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄\" again. If \"sign a scope\" is not possible, maybe \"align a scope\". \"align\" is a-l-i-g-n. \"a l i g n a s c o p e\". So \"a l i g n\" → \"a l I g n\" (since 🥺=I=i). So \"🐻🥺gn\" → \"l I g n\" (if 🐻=l). But 🐱=l (from feedback, 🐱=l is correct). So conflict. \"assign a scope\" → \"a s s i g n a s c o p e\". \"a s s i g n\" → \"a s s I g n\". So \"🐻🥺gn\" → \"s s I g n\" (if 🐻=s). But \"s\" is 🐰=s. So \"s s I g n\" → \"ssign\" which is not correct. \"assign\" is a-s-s-i-g-n. So \"a s s I g n\" → \"assign\". So \"🐻🥺gn\" would be \"s s I g n\" → \"ssign\", which is a typo for \"assign\". Maybe \"assign a scope\". So \"🐻=s\" (but duplicate s). Alternatively, \"design a scope\" → \"d e s i g n a s c o p e\". \"d e s i g n\" → \"d e s I g n\". So \"🐻🥺gn\" → \"d e s I g n\" (if 🐻=d, 🥺=e). But earlier we thought 🥺=I (i). So \"🥺=e\" would conflict. Because \"🥺n\" was \"In\" (i-n). So \"🥺=i\" is correct. \n\nLet's move to other parts. The part \"🐦🧐n🥺🤭🥺🥳😇🐱🥺👻🐼\" → \"m 🧐n I c I p a l I t 🐼\". \"mainicipalt...\" No. \"mysticipal...\" No. Let's think of \"mystical it...\" → \"mystical it\". \"mystical\" is m-y-s-t-i-c-a-l. So \"m y s t i c a l\" → \"m 🧐 s t i c a l\". So \"🐦🧐n\" → \"m y s t\" → \"m y s t\" (if 🧐=y, n=t). But \"t\" is 👻=t, \"n\" is n. So \"n\" would be \"n\". So \"m y s t n\" → no. \"mystical\" → m-y-s-t-i-c-a-l. So \"m y s t i c a l\" → \"m 🧐 s t I c a l\" (since 🥺=I=i). So \"🐦🧐n\" → \"m y s t\" → \"m\" (🐦=m), \"🧐=y\", \"n\" (n). So \"m y s t\" → \"myst\". Then \"🥺🤭🥺🥳\" → \"I c I p\" → \"icip\" (as in \"mystical icip...\" → \"mystical icip\" → \"mystical icip\" doesn't make sense). \n\nAlternatively, \"mystical event\" → \"mystical event\". \"mystical\" is m-y-s-t-i-c-a-l. \"event\" is e-v-e-n-t. But \"e\" is 😂=e, \"v\" is unknown. \n\nLet's summarize the emojis we have confirmed:\n\n- 👻=t (correct)\n- 🥶=h (correct)\n- 😂=e (correct)\n- 😇=a (correct)\n- 😱=f (correct)\n- 🙄=o (correct)\n- 🐱=l (correct)\n- 🥺=i (from \"In\" → \"🥺n\"=In)\n- 🤭=c (from \"Incorporated\" → \"🤭🙄\"=co)\n- 🐮=r (from \"Incorporated\" → \"🐮🥳\"=rp and \"🐮😇\"=ra)\n- 🥳=p (from \"Incorporated\" → \"🥳\"=p)\n- 🐰=s (from \"despite\" → \"🐰\"=s)\n- 🐦=m (from \"attempt\" → \"🐦\"=m)\n\nNow, we need to check if these fit into the encoded sentence. Let's list all the known emojis and their letters:\n\n👻=t, 🥶=h, 😂=e, 😇=a, 😱=f, 🙄=o, 🐱=l, 🥺=i, 🤭=c, 🐮=r, 🥳=p, 🐰=s, 🐦=m.\n\nNow, let's check if there are any other emojis left: 🤩, 🐭, 🐻, 🐼, 🧐, d (but \"d\" is a letter, not an emoji). The encoded sentence has emojis: 🥺,👻,🥶,😂,😱,😇,🐱,🙄,🤭,🐭,🐮,🤩,🥳,🐰,🐻,🐦,🧐,🐼.\n\nSo the remaining emojis to guess are: 🤩, 🐭, 🐻, 🐼, 🧐.\n\nLet's look for \"🤩😂🐮😂\" → \"🤩e r e\". \"🤩e r e\" → \"were\" (w-e-r-e). So \"🤩=w\". \"were\" is w-e-r-e. So \"🤩e r e\" → \"were\". That fits! So \"🤩=w\". Let's check: \"🤩e r e\" → \"were\". Correct. So 🤩=w.\n\nNext, \"d😂🐰🥳🥺👻😂\" → \"d e s p i t e\" → \"despite\" (correct, as before).\n\n\"😇n 😇👻👻😂🐦🥳👻\" → \"a n a t t e m p t\" → \"and attempt\" (correct).\n\n\"🐻🐼\" → \"🐻🐼\" in \"🐻🐼 🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄\" → \"🐻🐼 sign a scope\" (if \"🐻🥺gn\"=sign). Let's assume \"it sign a scope\" → \"it\" is i-t. \"i\" is 🥺=i, \"t\" is 👻=t. So \"it\" would be \"i t\". But \"🐻🐼\" is two emojis. \"it\" would be \"i t\", so \"🐻=i\" (but 🥺=i) or \"🐼=t\" (but 👻=t). Conflict. \"as sign a scope\" → \"as\" is a-s. \"a\" is 😇=a, \"s\" is 🐰=s. So \"as\" would be \"a s\". So \"🐻=a\" (conflict with 😇=a) or \"🐼=s\" (conflict with 🐰=s). \"so sign a scope\" → \"so\" is s-o. \"s\" is 🐰=s, \"o\" is 🙄=o. So \"so\" would be \"s o\". So \"🐻=s\" (conflict) or \"🐼=o\" (conflict). \"in sign a scope\" → \"in\" is i-n. \"i\" is 🥺=i, \"n\" is n. So \"in\" would be \"i n\". So \"🐻=i\" (conflict) or \"🐼=n\". So \"🐼=n\" → \"i n\" → \"in\". So \"🐻🐼\" → \"i n\" → \"in\". So \"🐻=i\" (conflict) or \"🐼=n\". If \"🐼=n\", then \"🐻\" could be another letter. Let's leave that for now.\n\nThe part \"🧐n🥺🤭🥺🥳😇🐱🥺👻🐼\" → \"🧐n i c i p a l i t 🐼\". \"principal\" is p-r-i-n-c-i-p-a-l. No, \"principal\" is p-r-i-n-c-i-p-a-l. \"mystical\" is m-y-s-t-i-c-a-l. \"magical\" is m-a-g-i-c-a-l. \"musical\" is m-u-s-i-c-a-l. \"mystical it\" → \"mystical it\". \"mystical\" is m-y-s-t-i-c-a-l. So \"m y s t i c a l i t\" → \"m y s t i c a l i t\". So \"🧐n\" → \"y s t\" → \"y s t n\" → no. Alternatively, \"mystical event\" → \"mystical event\". \"event\" is e-v-e-n-t. \"e\" is 😂=e, \"v\" is unknown. \n\nLet's look at \"🐭\" which is in \"🤭😇🐭😂🐮gn🙄\" → \"c a 🐭e r gn o\". \"c a 🐭e r gno\". \"cargo\" is c-a-r-g-o. \"c a r g o\" → \"c a r g o\". So \"c a 🐭e r gno\" → \"c a r g e r gno\" → no. \"cargo\" is c-a-r-g-o. So \"c a r g o\" → \"c a 🐭e r g o\" → \"c a r g e r g o\" → no. \"career\" is c-a-r-e-e-r. \"c a r e e r\" → \"c a 🐭e e r\" → \"c a r e e r\" → so \"🐭=r\" but 🐮=r. Conflict. \"cable\" is c-a-b-l-e. \"c a b l e\" → \"c a 🐭e r gno\" → \"c a b l e r gno\" → no. \"cage\" is c-a-g-e. \"c a g e\" → \"c a 🐭e r gno\" → \"c a g e r gno\" → \"cager gno\" → no. \"cake\" is c-a-k-e. \"c a k e\" → \"c a 🐭e r gno\" → \"c a k e r gno\" → \"caker gno\" → no. \"cave\" is c-a-v-e. \"c a v e\" → \"c a 🐭e r gno\" → \"c a v e r gno\" → \"caver gno\" → \"caver\" is a word (someone who explores caves). So \"caver gno\" → \"caver gno\" → \"caver\" + \"gno\" (maybe a typo for \"gno\" as part of a word). Alternatively, \"cavern\" → c-a-v-e-r-n. \"c a v e r n\" → \"c a 🐭e r n o\" → \"c a v e r n o\" → \"cavern o\" → \"cavern of\". That makes sense! \"In the fall of 2006, cavern of\". \"cavern\" is c-a-v-e-r-n. So \"c a v e r n o\" → \"cavern of\". So \"🐭=v\" (since \"🐭e\" = \"v e\"). So \"🐭=v\". Let's check:\n\n\"🤭😇🐭😂🐮gn🙄\" → \"c a v e r g n o\" → \"cavern o\" → \"cavern of\". Perfect! \"cavern of\" makes sense. So \"🐭=v\".\n\nNow, \"🐮gn\" → \"r g n\" → \"rgn\" is part of \"cavern\". \"cavern\" is c-a-v-e-r-n. So \"r-n\" is \"rn\" in \"cavern\". So \"r g n\" → \"rgn\" might be a typo, but \"cavern of\" fits the context.\n\nSo \"🐭=v\" is a good guess.\n\nNow, let's check the remaining emojis: 🐻, 🐼, 🧐.\n\nThe part \"🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄\" → \"🐻i g n a s c o\". \"sign a scope\" → \"s i g n a s c o p e\". So \"🐻=s\" (but 🐰=s). Conflict. \"align a scope\" → \"a l i g n a s c o p e\". \"a l i g n\" → \"a l i g n\". So \"🐻=a\" (conflict with 😇=a). \"design a scope\" → \"d e s i g n a s c o p e\". \"d e s i g n\" → \"d e s i g n\". So \"🐻=d\". Let's assume \"🐻=d\". Then \"d i g n a s c o\" → \"dignasco\" (not a word). \"resign a scope\" → \"r e s i g n a s c o p e\". \"r e s i g n\" → \"r e s i g n\". So \"🐻=r\" (conflict with 🐮=r). \"assign a scope\" → \"a s s i g n a s c o p e\". \"a s s i g n\" → \"a s s i g n\". So \"🐻=a\" (conflict) or \"s\". \n\nAlternatively, \"the company incorporated in 2006, cavern of and [something] to resist the [something]\". Maybe \"the company incorporated in 2006, cavern of and [something] to resist the attempt\". \n\nThe part \"🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄\" → \"🐻i g n a s c o\" → \"sign a scope\" (even with 🐻=s and 🐰=s conflict, but maybe the feedback allows it? No, emojis must have unique letters). So perhaps \"🐻\" is another letter. Let's leave it for now.\n\nThe last part: \"👻🥶😂 🤭🙄🧐🐮👻🐰.\" → \"t h e c o 🧐r t s.\" → \"the co[something]rts.\" \"the co[r]ts\" → \"the courts\". \"courts\" is c-o-u-r-t-s. So \"c o u r t s\" → \"c o 🧐r t s\". So \"🧐=u\". So \"🧐=u\". Then \"the courts\" → \"t h e c o u r t s\". Perfect! So \"👻🥶😂 🤭🙄🧐🐮👻🐰.\" → \"the courts.\" → \"the courts.\" That makes sense. So \"🧐=u\".\n\nLet's verify:\n\n\"🤭🙄🧐🐮👻🐰\" → \"c o u r t s\" → \"courts\". Yes! \"courts\" is c-o-u-r-t-s. So:\n\n🤭=c, 🙄=o, 🧐=u, 🐮=r, 👻=t, 🐰=s. Perfect! So \"courts\" is \"courts\". So \"🧐=u\".\n\nNow, the last part of the encoded sentence: \"👻🥶😂 🤭🙄🧐🐮👻🐰.\" → \"the courts.\" → Correct.\n\nNow, \"🐻🐼\" → \"🐻🐼\" in \"🐻🐼 🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄\" → \"🐻🐼 sign a scope\". Let's say \"it sign a scope\" → \"it\" is i-t. \"i\" is 🥺=i, \"t\" is 👻=t. So \"it\" would be \"i t\". So \"🐻=i\" (conflict) or \"🐼=t\" (conflict). \"as sign a scope\" → \"as\" is a-s. \"a\" is 😇=a, \"s\" is 🐰=s. So \"as\" would be \"a s\". So \"🐻=a\" (conflict) or \"🐼=s\" (conflict). \"so sign a scope\" → \"so\" is s-o. \"s\" is 🐰=s, \"o\" is 🙄=o. So \"so\" would be \"s o\". So \"🐻=s\" (conflict) or \"🐼=o\" (conflict). \"in sign a scope\" → \"in\" is i-n. \"i\" is 🥺=i, \"n\" is n. So \"in\" would be \"i n\". So \"🐻=i\" (conflict) or \"🐼=n\". So \"🐼=n\". Then \"🐻🐼\" → \"i n\" → \"in\". So \"in sign a scope\" → \"in sign a scope\". That makes sense. So \"🐼=n\".\n\nLet's check \"🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄\" → \"🐻i g n a s c o\". If \"🐻=k\", then \"k i g n a s c o\" → \"kignasco\" (not a word). \"🐻=b\" → \"bignasco\" (not a word). \"🐻=g\" → \"gignasco\" (not a word). Maybe \"the company incorporated in 2006, cavern of and [something] to resist the attempt in sign a scope the courts.\" It's a bit forced, but perhaps \"🐻\" is a less common letter. Since we have to include all known emojis and the hint, and the ones we've deduced, let's list all the emojis with their letters:\n\n- 👻=t (correct)\n- 🥶=h (correct)\n- 😂=e (correct)\n- 😇=a (correct)\n- 😱=f (correct)\n- 🙄=o (correct)\n- 🐱=l (correct)\n- 🥺=i\n- 🤭=c\n- 🐭=v\n- 🐮=r\n- 🤩=w\n- 🥳=p\n- 🐰=s\n- 🐦=m\n- 🧐=u\n- 🐼=n\n- 🐻=? (unknown, but maybe we don't need to guess it if it's not in the required format. But the problem says to submit guesses, including previously correct and the hint. The user's answer must include the hint (👻=t) and previously correctly answered emojis. From the history, the first guess had 👻=t (correct), 🥶=h (correct), 😂=e (correct), 😇=a (correct), 😱=f (correct), 🙄=o (correct), 🐱=l (correct). The others (🤭, 🐭, 🐮) were wrong. So our answer must include all the correct ones from history, plus any new ones we've deduced.\n\nSo the answer should include:\n\n👻=t, 🥶=h, 😂=e, 😇=a, 😱=f, 🙄=o, 🐱=l (from history, correct), plus the new ones we deduced: 🥺=i, 🤭=c, 🐭=v, 🐮=r, 🤩=w, 🥳=p, 🐰=s, 🐦=m, 🧐=u, 🐼=n.\n\nBut let's check if all these fit. Let's verify with the encoded sentence:\n\nEncoded Sentence after substitution:\n\n🥺n (i n) → \"in\"\n👻🥶😂 (t h e) → \"the\"\n😱😇🐱🐱 (f a l l) → \"fall\"\n🙄😱 (o f) → \"of\"\n2006, \n🤭😇🐭😂🐮gn🙄 (c a v e r g n o) → \"cavern of\" (assuming \"gno\" is a typo or part of the word)\n😇nd (a n d) → \"and\"\n🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄 (🐻i g n a s c o) → \"sign a scope\" (assuming 🐻=s, even with conflict, but maybe I made a mistake here)\n🤩😂🐮😂 (w e r e) → \"were\"\n🥺n🤭🙄🐮🥳🙄🐮😇👻😂d (i n c o r p o r a t e d) → \"incorporated\"\n🥺n👻🙄 (i n t o) → \"into\"\n👻🥶😂 (t h e) → \"the\"\n🐦🧐n🥺🤭🥺🥳😇🐱🥺👻🐼 (m u n i c i p a l i t n) → \"municipal itn\" (maybe \"municipal item\" or a typo)\nd😂🐰🥳🥺👻😂 (d e s p i t e) → \"despite\"\n😇n (a n) → \"an\"\n😇👻👻😂🐦🥳👻 (a t t e m p t) → \"attempt\"\n🐻🐼 (🐻n) → \"sn\" (if 🐻=s, 🐼=n) → \"sn\" (not a word)\n🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄 (s i g n a s c o) → \"sign a scope\"\n👻🙄 (t o) → \"to\"\n🐮😂🐰🥺🐰👻 (r e s i s t) → \"resist\"\n👻🥶😂 (t h e) → \"the\"\n🥺n🤭🙄🐮🥳🙄🐮😇👻🥺🙄n (i n c o r p o r a t i o n) → \"incorporation\" (if \"i n c o r p o r a t i o n\")\n🥺n (i n) → \"in\"\n👻🥶😂 (t h e) → \"the\"\n🤭🙄🧐🐮👻🐰. (c o u r t s.) → \"courts.\"\n\nThis mostly makes sense, with some possible typos or missing letters, but the key parts fit. So the final answer includes all the deduced emojis.\n\nTo solve the Crypto Word Game, we analyze the encoded sentence using the provided hint, feedback from previous attempts, and contextual clues. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Known Correct Emojis (from History):\n- 👻=t (hint, confirmed)\n- 🥶=h (confirmed)\n- 😂=e (confirmed)\n- 😇=a (confirmed)\n- 😱=f (confirmed)\n- 🙄=o (confirmed)\n- 🐱=l (confirmed)\n\n### Deductions from Context:\n1. **🥺n** in \"🥺n 👻🥶😂 😱😇🐱🐱 🙄😱 2006\" translates to \"In the fall of 2006\" (since \"the fall of 2006\" is a common phrase). Thus, 🥺=i (as \"🥺n\" = \"In\").\n2. **🤭🙄** in \"🥺n🤭🙄🐮🥳🙄🐮😇👻😂d\" (translating to \"Incorporated\") implies \"co\" (as \"Incorporated\" starts with \"Inco...\"). Thus, 🤭=c (🤭🙄 = \"co\").\n3. **🐮🥳** and **🐮😇** in \"Incorporated\" translate to \"rp\" and \"ra\" (parts of \"corporate\"). Thus, 🐮=r (🐮🥳 = \"rp\"; 🐮😇 = \"ra\") and 🥳=p (🥳 = \"p\").\n4. **🐰** in \"d😂🐰🥳🥺👻😂\" (translating to \"despite\") implies \"s\" (as \"despite\" is \"d-e-s-p-i-t-e\"). Thus, 🐰=s.\n5. **🐦** in \"😇👻👻😂🐦🥳👻\" (translating to \"attempt\") implies \"m\" (as \"attempt\" includes \"mpt\"). Thus, 🐦=m.\n6. **🤩** in \"🤩😂🐮😂\" (translating to \"were\") implies \"w\" (as \"were\" is \"w-e-r-e\"). Thus, 🤩=w.\n7. **🐭** in \"🤭😇🐭😂🐮gn🙄\" (translating to \"cavern of\") implies \"v\" (as \"cavern\" is \"c-a-v-e-r-n\"). Thus, 🐭=v.\n8. **🧐** in \"🤭🙄🧐🐮👻🐰\" (translating to \"courts\") implies \"u\" (as \"courts\" is \"c-o-u-r-t-s\"). Thus, 🧐=u.\n9. **🐼** in \"🐦🧐n🥺🤭🥺🥳😇🐱🥺👻🐼\" (translating to \"municipal itn\") implies \"n\" (completing \"itn\" as part of the phrase). Thus, 🐼=n.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAll known and deduced emojis are compiled below.\n\nAnswer: 👻=t, 🥶=h, 😂=e, 😇=a, 😱=f, 🙄=o, 🐱=l, 🥺=i, 🤭=c, 🐭=v, 🐮=r, 🤩=w, 🥳=p, 🐰=s, 🐦=m, 🧐=u, 🐼=n","Okay, let's try to figure out the current guess. First, let's list out all the emojis that have been confirmed from the history. \n\nFrom the first attempt, the feedback shows that 👻=t, 🥶=h, 😂=e, 😇=a, 😱=f, 🙄=o, 🐱=l are correct. The others in that guess (🤭, 🐭, 🐮) were wrong. \n\nIn the second attempt, they added more emojis. The feedback for the second guess says that 🥺=i, 🤭=c, 🐭=v, 🐮=r, 🤩=w, 🥳=p, 🐰=s, 🐦=m, 🧐=u are correct. Only 🐼 was wrong. \n\nSo let's compile the known mappings so far:\n\n👻=t, 🥶=h, 😂=e, 😇=a, 😱=f, 🙄=o, 🐱=l, 🥺=i, 🤭=c, 🐭=v, 🐮=r, 🤩=w, 🥳=p, 🐰=s, 🐦=m, 🧐=u.\n\nThe only emoji left from the encoded sentence that's not yet mapped is 🐻 and 🐼. Let's check the encoded sentence again to see where these appear.\n\nLooking at the encoded sentence:\n\n\"🥺n 👻🥶😂 😱😇🐱🐱 🙄😱 2006, 🤭😇🐭😂🐮gn🙄 😇nd 🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄 🤩😂🐮😂 🥺n🤭🙄🐮🥳🙄🐮😇👻😂d 🥺n👻🙄 👻🥶😂 🐦🧐n🥺🤭🥺🥳😇🐱🥺👻🐼, d😂🐰🥳🥺👻😂 😇n 😇👻👻😂🐦🥳👻 🐻🐼 🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄 👻🙄 🐮😂🐰🥺🐰👻 👻🥶😂 🥺n🤭🙄🐮🥳🙄🐮😇👻🥺🙄n 🥺n 👻🥶😂 🤭🙄🧐🐮👻🐰.\"\n\nLet's substitute the known emojis:\n\n🥺=i, so \"i n\" (maybe \"in\")\n👻=t, 🥶=h, 😂=e → \"the\"\n😱=f, 😇=a, 🐱=l, 🐱=l → \"fall\"\n🙄=o, 😱=f → \"of\"\n2006, that's the year. Then:\n\n🤭=c, 😇=a, 🐭=v, 😂=e, 🐮=r → \"c a v e r gn o\" → \"c a v e r gno\" (maybe \"cave r... gno\" → \"cave in go\"? Wait, \"gn\" might be \"in\" since \"gn\" in English could be \"in\" if \"g\" is \"i\"? Wait, let's see. The part after that is \"gn🙄\" → \"gn o\". If \"gn\" is \"in\", then \"in o\" → \"ino\"? Or maybe \"g\" is another letter. Wait, maybe \"gn\" is part of a word. Let's move on.\n\n\"😇nd\" → \"a nd\" → \"and\" (so \"and\" is correct, which fits). \n\nNext: \"🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄\" → \"🐻 i gn a s c o\". Let's break it down. \"gn\" again. If \"gn\" is \"in\", then \"i in a s c o\" → \"i in as co\"? Maybe \"bear\" (if 🐻 is b) → \"b i in a s c o\" → \"b in as co\"? Hmm. Let's check another part.\n\n\"🤩😂🐮😂\" → \"w e r e\" → \"were\" (that makes sense: 🤩=w, 😂=e, 🐮=r, 😂=e → \"were\"). That's a good fit.\n\nNext: \"🥺n🤭🙄🐮🥳🙄🐮😇👻😂d\" → \"i n c o r p o r a t e d\" → \"incorporated\". Let's check: 🥺=i, n (letter), 🤭=c, 🙄=o, 🐮=r, 🥳=p, 🙄=o, 🐮=r, 😇=a, 👻=t, 😂=e, d → \"i n c o r p o r a t e d\" → \"incorporated\". That's perfect! So that part is \"incorporated\".\n\nThen \"🥺n👻🙄\" → \"i n t o\" → \"into\" (🥺=i, n, 👻=t, 🙄=o → \"into\").\n\n\"👻🥶😂\" → \"the\" again. \n\n\"🐦🧐n🥺🤭🥺🥳😇🐱🥺👻🐼\" → \"m u n i c i p a l i t 🐼\". Let's substitute: 🐦=m, 🧐=u, n, 🥺=i, 🤭=c, 🥺=i, 🥳=p, 😇=a, 🐱=l, 🥺=i, 👻=t, 🐼=?. So \"m u n i c i p a l i t [?]\". That looks like \"municipalit?\" which is \"municipality\". So \"municipality\" would mean 🐼=y. Because \"municipalit\" + y = \"municipality\". That makes sense. So 🐼=y.\n\nNext part: \"d😂🐰🥳🥺👻😂\" → \"d e s p i t e\" → \"despite\" (d, 😂=e, 🐰=s, 🥳=p, 🥺=i, 👻=t, 😂=e → \"despite\"). That works.\n\n\"😇n\" → \"a n\" → \"an\".\n\n\"😇👻👻😂🐦🥳👻\" → \"a t t e m p t\" → \"attempt\" (😇=a, 👻=t, 👻=t, 😂=e, 🐦=m, 🥳=p, 👻=t → \"attempt\"). Perfect.\n\n\"🐻🐼\" → \"🐻 y\". Let's see where else 🐻 appears. The part \"🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄\" we had earlier. If 🐼=y, maybe \"🐻 y\" is \"by\". So if 🐻=b, then \"by\". Let's check that. \"🐻=b\" would make \"by\". Let's verify.\n\nAnother part: \"🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄\" → \"b i gn a s c o\". If \"gn\" is \"in\", then \"b i in a s c o\" → \"b in as co\"? Maybe \"b\" is \"b\", and \"gn\" is \"in\". Let's look at \"gn\" in \"🤭😇🐭😂🐮gn🙄\" → \"c a v e r gn o\". If \"gn\" is \"in\", then \"c a v e r in o\" → \"c a v e r in o\" → \"caverino\"? Maybe \"cavern\" but that's \"cavern o\"? Alternatively, perhaps \"gn\" is \"ng\". Let's check \"incorporated\" had \"gn\" as part of \"corporate\" → \"corporate\" is \"corp\" + \"orate\". Wait, \"corporated\" is \"corporated\" → \"corp\" (c o r p) + \"orated\" (o r a t e d). Oh, in the earlier part \"🥺n🤭🙄🐮🥳🙄🐮😇👻😂d\" → \"i n c o r p o r a t e d\" → \"incorporated\". So \"gn\" here is part of \"corporated\". The \"gn\" in \"corporated\" is \"porated\"? No. Wait, the original substitution: \"c o r p o r a t e d\" → \"c o r p o r a t e d\". So \"gn\" in the encoded sentence would be \"r p o r a t e d\"? No, maybe I'm mixing up. Let's look again.\n\nThe encoded part after 2006 is: \"🤭😇🐭😂🐮gn🙄\" → substituting knowns: 🤭=c, 😇=a, 🐭=v, 😂=e, 🐮=r, so \"c a v e r gn o\". So \"caver gno\". What's \"caver gno\"? Maybe \"cavern go\"? But \"cavern\" is \"cavern\" (c a v e r n). Oh! \"cavern\" would be \"c a v e r n\". So \"gn\" here could be \"n\". Because \"caver gn o\" → \"caver n o\". If \"gn\" is \"n\", then \"cavern o\" → \"cavern o\" which could be \"cavern of\"? Because the next part is \"😇nd\" → \"and\". So \"cavern of and...\" That makes sense. So \"gn\" would be \"n\", which would mean that \"g\" is \"n\"? Wait, but \"gn\" is two letters. Let's think of another angle.\n\nLooking at the part \"🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄\" → \"🐻 i gn a s c o\". If \"gn\" is \"ng\", then \"i ng a s c o\" → \"ingasco\"? Maybe \"b\" is \"b\", so \"b i ng a s c o\" → \"bingoasco\"? No. Alternatively, maybe \"🐻\" is \"b\", and \"gn\" is \"an\". Let's check \"🐻=b\" and \"gn=an\" → \"b i an a s c o\" → \"bianasco\"? That's a place name maybe. Let's see another occurrence of 🐻. The part \"🐻🐼\" → if 🐻=b and 🐼=y, then \"by\" which is a common word. That fits. Let's check that. \"d😂🐰🥳🥺👻😂 😇n 😇👻👻😂🐦🥳👻 🐻🐼\" → \"despite an attempt by\". Let's substitute: \"d e s p i t e\" (despite), \"a n\" (an), \"a t t e m p t\" (attempt), \"b y\" (by). That makes sense: \"despite an attempt by\". That's a perfect fit! So \"🐻=b\" and \"🐼=y\" would make \"by\" here.\n\nLet's check another part with 🐻: \"🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄\" → \"b i gn a s c o\". If \"gn\" is \"an\", then \"b i an a s c o\" → \"bianasco\" (maybe a place name). Let's see if that works. The next part after that is \"🤩😂🐮😂\" → \"w e r e\" (were). So the full part would be \"c a v e r ... and bianasco were incorporated into the municipality...\" That could make sense.\n\nAnother part: \"🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄 👻🙄 🐮😂🐰🥺🐰👻 👻🥶😂\" → \"bianasco to r e s i s t the\". Let's substitute: \"🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄\"=bianasco, \"👻🙄\"=to (t o), \"🐮😂🐰🥺🐰👻\"=r e s i s t (r e s i s t), \"👻🥶😂\"=the. So \"bianasco to resist the\". That makes sense.\n\nThen \"🥺n🤭🙄🐮🥳🙄🐮😇👻🥺🙄n\" → \"i n c o r p o r a t i o n\" (incorporation). Let's check: 🥺=i, n, 🤭=c, 🙄=o, 🐮=r, 🥳=p, 🙄=o, 🐮=r, 😇=a, 👻=t, 🥺=i, 🙄=o, n → \"i n c o r p o r a t i o n\" → \"incorporation\". Perfect.\n\nFinally, \"🥺n 👻🥶😂 🤭🙄🧐🐮👻🐰\" → \"in the c o u r t s\" (in the courts). Substituting: 🥺=i, n, 👻=t, 🥶=h, 😂=e → \"in the\", 🤭=c, 🙄=o, 🧐=u, 🐮=r, 👻=t, 🐰=s → \"courts\". So \"in the courts\". That's correct.\n\nPutting it all together, the remaining emojis are 🐻 and 🐼. From the \"despite an attempt by\" part, \"🐻🐼\" is \"by\", so 🐻=b and 🐼=y.

The encoded sentence uses emojis where each represents a unique letter, and we know that 🥵=a from the hint. First, I need to look for patterns and common words in the encoded sentence.\n\nLet's start by writing down the encoded sentence with 🥵 replaced by 'a':\n\nEncoded (with 🥵=a): a👽 👽🦊🤑 🐰🐵🤑a👽 a🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸a😈 🦁a👻🦊 🐱😈 a🥶🤫🥳🤓 20, 2008, 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳 🥺🤑😴🤑a👽🤑🥺 😈a👽a🥳🤓a 👽🐱 🦁🤑🐸🐱🧐🤑 👽🦊🤑 🐶😈a🤫🐰🤫🐵a🥳 🥺🐶🤧a👻 🐸🦊a🧐😇🐶🐱😈.\n\nNow, let's analyze word lengths. Let's split the sentence into words (split by spaces):\n\n1. a👽 (2 letters)\n2. 👽🦊🤑 (3 letters)\n3. 🐰🐵🤑a👽 (5 letters)\n4. a🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸a😈 (7 letters)\n5. 🦁a👻🦊 (4 letters)\n6. 🐱😈 (2 letters)\n7. a🥶🤫🥳🤓 (5 letters)\n8. 20, 2008, (numbers, maybe not relevant yet)\n9. 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳 (6 letters)\n10. 🥺🤑😴🤑a👽🤑🥺 (8 letters)\n11. 😈a👽a🥳🤓a (7 letters)\n12. 👽🐱 (2 letters)\n13. 🦁🤑🐸🐱🧐🤑 (6 letters)\n14. 👽🦊🤑 (3 letters) [same as word 2]\n15. 🐶😈a🤫🐰🤫🐵a🥳 (8 letters)\n16. 🥺🐶🤧a👻 (6 letters)\n17. 🐸🦊a🧐😇🐶🐱😈 (8 letters)\n\nLooking for repeated words. Word 2 and 14 are the same: 👽🦊🤑 (3 letters). So that's a 3-letter word that repeats. Common 3-letter words in English are \"the\", \"and\", \"for\", \"are\", \"but\", \"not\", \"you\", \"all\", \"any\", etc.\n\nWord 1 is a👽 (2 letters). Since the first letter is 'a' (from 🥵=a), the second emoji 👽 is the second letter. 2-letter words starting with 'a' could be \"at\", \"an\", \"as\", \"am\", \"ad\" (less common). Let's keep that in mind.\n\nWord 6 is 🐱😈 (2 letters). Word 12 is 👽🐱 (2 letters). Let's note that.\n\nWord 7: a🥶🤫🥳🤓 (5 letters, starts with 'a'). Common 5-letter words starting with 'a' could be \"about\", \"after\", \"again\", \"along\", \"among\", \"around\", \"aspect\", \"audio\", etc.\n\nWord 9: 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳 (6 letters). The structure is XYYZZQ (if 🧐=X, 🐸=Y, 🐱=Z, 🥳=Q). Maybe a word with repeated letters, like \"committee\" (but that's 9 letters), \"booklet\" (booklet has 'oo' and 'k', but 8 letters), \"bubble\" (bb, u, le?), \"toffee\" (tt, ff, ee), \"letter\" (tt, er), \"little\" (tt, le), \"better\" (tt, er). 6 letters: \"little\" (l,i,t,t,l,e) → structure L I T T L E → X= L, Y=T, Z=L, Q=E → but 6 letters: \"little\" is 6 letters (L-I-T-T-L-E). Let's check: X= L, Y=T, Z=L, Q=E → then the word would be L T T L L E → \"LTTLLE\"? That's not \"little\". \"Bottle\" is B-O-T-T-L-E → B O T T L E → structure X=B, Y=T, Z=L, Q=E → B O T T L E → \"BOTTLE\" (6 letters). That fits X=B, Y=T, Z=L, Q=E. So if the word is \"bottle\", then 🧐=B, 🐸=T, 🐱=L, 🥳=E. Let's tentatively note that.\n\nIf 🐱=L (from above), then word 6 is 🐱😈= L+? (2 letters). 2-letter words with L could be \"it\", \"in\", \"is\", \"if\", \"im\", \"of\", \"on\", \"at\", \"as\", \"an\", \"am\", \"or\", \"so\", \"he\", \"she\", \"we\", \"me\", \"my\", \"by\", \"be\", \"up\", \"us\", \"do\", \"no\", \"go\", \"to\", \"ok\", \"hi\", \"lo\", \"li\", \"la\", \"le\". \"Le\" is possible (as in \"le\" as a prefix, but maybe \"le\" is a word in some contexts, but more likely, \"le\" is part of a word. Alternatively, if 🐱=L, word 12 is 👽🐱= X+L (2 letters). So 👽= first letter, X=?, L=second. So 👽= maybe 'b' (BL?), 'c' (CL?), 'd' (DL?), 'f' (FL?), 'g' (GL?), 'h' (HL?), 'k' (KL?), 'm' (ML?), 'n' (NL?), 'p' (PL), 'r' (RL), 's' (SL), 't' (TL), 'v' (VL), 'w' (WL), 'y' (YL). \"Pl\" is possible, but 2-letter words: \"pl\" isn't a word. \"Sl\" could be part of \"sle\", but not a word. \"Fl\" same. \"Cl\" same. \"Bl\" same. \"Gl\" same. Maybe 👽= 't' → TL? Not a word. Alternatively, maybe 👽= 's' → SL (as in \"sl\" in \"slept\"), but not a word. Maybe 👽= 'o' → OL (as in \"ol\" in \"old\"), but 2-letter \"ol\" is possible (as in \"ol\" for old). Alternatively, 👽= 'i' → IL (as in \"ill\"), but 2 letters: \"il\" is a prefix. Maybe 👽= 'w' → WL (no). Alternatively, perhaps 👽= 'h' → HL (no). Maybe 👽= 'd' → DL (no). Hmm, maybe the 2-letter words are \"he\", \"she\", \"it\", \"is\", \"in\", \"on\", \"at\", etc. Let's look at word 1: a👽 (2 letters). If a👽 is \"an\", then 👽=n. Let's check that possibility. If 👽=n, then word 1 is \"an\". Let's test 👽=n.\n\nIf 👽=n, then word 2 and 14 (👽🦊🤑) = n + 🦊 + 🤑 (3 letters). 3-letter words starting with 'n' could be \"not\", \"now\", \"new\", \"net\", \"nor\", \"nut\", \"nip\", \"nap\", \"nag\", \"nod\", \"nth\". Let's say \"not\" → 🦊=o, 🤑=t. Let's test that. So 👽=n, 🦊=o, 🤑=t. Then word 2 is \"not\".\n\nWord 3: 🐰🐵🤑a👽 = 🐰🐵t a n (5 letters). So the word is [🐰][🐵]tan. 5-letter words ending with \"tan\" could be \"satan\" (S-A-T-A-N), but that's 5 letters: S-A-T-A-N. So [🐰] = s, [🐵] = a? Wait, but [🐵] would be 'a'? But we already have 🥵=a, and each emoji is unique. So [🐵] can't be 'a'. So \"satan\" is S-A-T-A-N, but [🐵] would be A (same as 🥵=a), which is not allowed. So maybe \"stamp\" (stamp: s-t-a-m-p) → but the ending is \"tan\". Alternatively, \"mantan\"? No. Maybe \"brand\"? No. Alternatively, \"tramp\" (t-r-a-m-p) → no. Alternatively, \"clamp\" (c-l-a-m-p). Alternatively, \"plant\" (p-l-a-n-t). Oh, \"plant\" is 5 letters: P-L-A-N-T. So if the word is \"plant\", then the letters are P-L-A-N-T. Let's check: [🐰] = p, [🐵] = l, 🤑=t (from before), a (🥵=a), 👽=n (from before). So [🐰]=p, [🐵]=l. Then word 3 would be P-L-T-A-N → wait, no, the structure is 🐰🐵🤑a👽 → [🐰][🐵] t a n. So letters: [1][2] t a n. So 5 letters: [1][2]tan. \"Plant\" is P-L-A-N-T → but that's P-L-A-N-T. Oh, no, \"plant\" is P-L-A-N-T (5 letters), so [1] = p, [2] = l, then [1][2]tan would be P-L-T-A-N → \"PLTAN\" which is not \"plant\". Maybe \"slant\" (s-l-a-n-t). So [1] = s, [2] = l, then [1][2]tan = S-L-T-A-N → \"SLTAN\" → not \"slant\". \"Slant\" is S-L-A-N-T. So the structure would be [1][2]a👽🤑 → but the word is 🐰🐵🤑a👽, which is [1][2] t a n. So 5 letters: positions 1,2,3=t,4=a,5=n. So the word is [1][2]tan. Let's think of 5-letter words where the third letter is 't', fourth is 'a', fifth is 'n'. For example, \"batan\" (not a word), \"datan\" (data n?), \"fatan\" (no), \"gatan\" (no), \"katan\" (katan is a type of sword, maybe). \"Katan\" is a 5-letter word. So [1]=k, [2]=a → but [2] can't be 'a' (already used). Alternatively, \"matan\" (no), \"patan\" (no), \"ratan\" (rattan, but that's 6 letters: r-a-t-t-a-n). \"Ratan\" is a name, 5 letters. So R-A-T-A-N. Then [1]=r, [2]=a → [2] can't be 'a'. So maybe \"satan\" (S-A-T-A-N). Then [1]=s, [2]=a → [2] can't be 'a'. So this approach might not be right. Let's backtrack.\n\nLet's look at word 11: 😈a👽a🥳🤓a (7 letters). With 🥵=a, so the letters are 😈 a 👽 a 🥳 🤓 a. So the structure is X A Y A Z W A (7 letters). Common 7-letter words with A in positions 2,4,7. For example, \"bananaa\" (no), \"cabbage\" (no), \"dangerous\" (no). Maybe \"fantasia\" (too long). Alternatively, \"marathon\" (M-A-R-A-T-H-O-N) → 8 letters. \"Paradigm\" (P-A-R-A-D-I-G-M) → 8 letters. \"Marauder\" (8 letters). \"Cavalier\" (8 letters). Maybe \"sardonic\" (S-A-R-D-O-N-I-C) → 8 letters. Alternatively, \"sabotage\" (S-A-B-O-T-A-G-E) → 8 letters. Hmm.\n\nWord 4: a🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸a😈 (7 letters, starts with a). So A X Y Z Q R A S. 7-letter words starting with 'a'. \"Amazing\" (A-M-A-Z-I-N-G) → 7 letters. Structure A M A Z I N G. So positions 1=A, 2=M, 3=A, 4=Z, 5=I, 6=N, 7=G. But our structure is A X Y Z Q R A S → 8 characters? Wait, let's count the emojis in word 4: 🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈 → that's 8 emojis (since 🥵=a, so 8 letters). Oh, I miscounted earlier. Let's recount:\n\nEncoded sentence split correctly:\n\nLet's split the original encoded sentence properly, considering spaces. The original sentence is:\n\n🥵👽 👽🦊🤑 🐰🐵🤑🥵👽 🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈 🦁🥵👻🦊 🐱😈 🥶🤫🥳🤓 20, 2008, 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳 🥺🤑😴🤑🥵👽🤑🥺 😈🥵👽🥵🥳🤓🥵 👽🐱 🦁🤑🐸🐱🧐🤑 👽🦊🤑 🐶😈🥵🤫🐰🤫🐵🥵🥳 🥺🐶🤧🥵👻 🐸🦊🥵🧐😇🐶🐱😈.\n\nSo splitting by spaces:\n\n1. 🥵👽 → 2 emojis (a👽)\n2. 👽🦊🤑 → 3 emojis (👽🦊🤑)\n3. 🐰🐵🤑🥵👽 → 5 emojis (🐰🐵🤑a👽)\n4. 🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈 → 8 emojis (a🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸a😈)\n5. 🦁🥵👻🦊 → 4 emojis (🦁a👻🦊)\n6. 🐱😈 → 2 emojis (🐱😈)\n7. 🥶🤫🥳🤓 → 4 emojis (🥶🤫🥳🤓) [I think I miscounted earlier, 7th word is 4 emojis, not 5. The 7th word is \"🥶🤫🥳🤓\" → 4 emojis]\n8. 20, 2008, → numbers\n9. 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳 → 6 emojis (🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳)\n10. 🥺🤑😴🤑🥵👽🤑🥺 → 8 emojis (🥺🤑😴🤑a👽🤑🥺)\n11. 😈🥵👽🥵🥳🤓🥵 → 7 emojis (😈a👽a🥳🤓a)\n12. 👽🐱 → 2 emojis (👽🐱)\n13. 🦁🤑🐸🐱🧐🤑 → 6 emojis (🦁🤑🐸🐱🧐🤑)\n14. 👽🦊🤑 → 3 emojis (👽🦊🤑) [same as word 2]\n15. 🐶😈🥵🤫🐰🤫🐵🥵🥳 → 9 emojis (🐶😈a🤫🐰🤫🐵a🥳)\n16. 🥺🐶🤧🥵👻 → 6 emojis (🥺🐶🤧a👻)\n17. 🐸🦊🥵🧐😇🐶🐱😈 → 8 emojis (🐸🦊a🧐😇🐶🐱😈)\n\nOkay, correction: word 7 is 4 emojis, not 5. So 7. 🥶🤫🥳🤓 → 4 letters.\n\nLet's go back to word 9: 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳 (6 emojis). Structure X Y Y Z Z Q. Let's think of 6-letter words with two pairs of repeated letters. For example, \"booklet\" (B-O-O-K-L-E-T → 7 letters), \"committee\" (9 letters), \"toffee\" (T-O-F-F-E-E → 6 letters: T-O-F-F-E-E → structure X= T, Y=O, Z=F, Q=E? No, \"toffee\" is T-O-F-F-E-E → letters T O F F E E. So X=T, Y=O, Z=F, Q=E → but the structure would be X Y Y Z Z Q → T O O F F E → \"TOOFFE\" which is not \"toffee\". \"Bubble\" (B-U-B-B-L-E → 6 letters: B U B B L E → structure X=B, Y=U, Z=B, Q=L? No. \"Letter\" (L-E-T-T-E-R → 6 letters: L E T T E R → structure X=L, Y=E, Z=T, Q=E → X Y Y Z Z Q would be L E E T T R → \"LEETTR\" → not \"letter\". \"Little\" (L-I-T-T-L-E → 6 letters: L I T T L E → structure X=L, Y=I, Z=T, Q=L → X Y Y Z Z Q → L I I T T L → \"LIITT L\" → not \"little\". \"Billet\" (B-I-L-L-E-T → 6 letters: B I L L E T → structure X=B, Y=I, Z=L, Q=E → X Y Y Z Z Q → B I I L L E → \"BIILLE\" → \"billet\" is B-I-L-L-E-T, which is 6 letters but structure B I L L E T → X=B, Y=I, Z=L, Q=E → but the structure of word 9 is X Y Y Z Z Q → positions 1:X, 2:Y, 3:Y, 4:Z, 5:Z, 6:Q. So \"BIILLE\" would be that structure. \"Billet\" is B-I-L-L-E-T → 6 letters, but positions 1-6: B(1), I(2), L(3), L(4), E(5), T(6) → structure X=B, Y=I, Z=L, Q=E? No, because Y is I (position 2), then Y would need to be position 3. So 2 and 3 are Y. So 2 and 3 are same: Y. 4 and 5 are same: Z. So \"BIILLE\" would be B-I-I-L-L-E → 6 letters. \"BIILLE\" isn't a word. \"Skeeter\" (S-K-E-E-T-E-R → 7 letters). \"Doodle\" (D-O-O-D-L-E → 6 letters: D O O D L E → structure X=D, Y=O, Z=D, Q=L → X Y Y Z Z Q → D O O D D L → \"DOODDL\" → no. \"Doodle\" is D-O-O-D-L-E → 6 letters, positions 1-6: D, O, O, D, L, E → structure X=D, Y=O, Z=D, Q=L. So 1:X, 2:Y, 3:Y, 4:Z, 5:Q, 6:E. Not matching. \"Addict\" (A-D-D-I-C-T → 6 letters: A D D I C T → structure X=A, Y=D, Z=I, Q=C → X Y Y Z Z Q → A D D I I C → \"ADDIIC\" → no. \"Mamma\" (M-A-M-M-A → 5 letters). \"Queue\" (Q-U-E-U-E → 5 letters). \"Committee\" (C-O-M-M-I-T-T-E-E → 9 letters). Maybe \"coffee\" (C-O-F-F-E-E → 6 letters: C O F F E E → structure X=C, Y=O, Z=F, Q=E → X Y Y Z Z Q → C O O F F E → \"COOFFE\" → \"coffee\" is C-O-F-F-E-E → 6 letters, positions 1-6: C, O, F, F, E, E. So 1:X=C, 2:Y=O, 3:Z=F, 4:Z=F, 5:Q=E, 6:Q=E. So structure X Y Z Z Q Q → which matches \"coffee\". Oh! \"coffee\" is C-O-F-F-E-E → 6 letters, so positions 1=C, 2=O, 3=F, 4=F, 5=E, 6=E. So if word 9 is \"coffee\", then the structure would be X= C, Y=O, Z=F, Q=E. So:\n\n🧐 = C (position 1)\n🐸 = O (position 2)\n🐸 = O (position 3)\n🐱 = F (position 4)\n🐱 = F (position 5)\n🥳 = E (position 6)\n\nYes! That fits. \"coffee\" is 6 letters, and the structure of word 9 is 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳 → C-O-O-F-F-E → \"coffee\". Perfect! So let's tentatively assign:\n\n🧐 = C\n🐸 = O\n🐱 = F\n🥳 = E\n\nLet's check this. Then word 9: 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳 = C-O-O-F-F-E → \"coffee\". That works. Great.\n\nNow, word 6: 🐱😈 = F + ? (2 letters). 2-letter words starting with F: \"fa\", \"fe\", \"fi\", \"fo\", \"fr\" (no), \"fs\" (no), \"ft\" (no), \"fu\" (no). \"Fe\" is a valid word (iron in Latin, or \"fe\" as a prefix). \"Fo\" (as in \"fo'c'sle\"). \"Fi\" (musical note). \"Fa\" (musical note). Let's see if we can find more clues.\n\nWord 12: 👽🐱 = 👽 + F (2 letters). So 👽 is a letter, and the word is [👽]F. 2-letter words ending with F: \"af\" (no), \"ef\" (no), \"ff\" (no), \"gf\" (no), \"hf\" (no), \"jf\" (no), \"lf\" (no), \"mf\" (no), \"nf\" (no), \"pf\" (no), \"rf\" (no), \"sf\" (no), \"tf\" (no), \"uf\" (no), \"vf\" (no), \"wf\" (no), \"xf\" (no), \"yf\" (no), \"zf\" (no). None of these are valid 2-letter words. So maybe 👽🐱 is a 2-letter word where 👽 is the first letter and 🐱=F is the second. So [👽]F. Let's think of 2-letter words: \"if\" (I-F). Oh! \"if\" is a 2-letter word. So if 👽=I, then 👽🐱=I-F → \"if\". That's a valid word. Let's check 👽=I.\n\nIf 👽=I, then word 1: 🥵👽 = A-I → \"ai\". \"Ai\" is a valid word (a type of sloth). Possible. Let's check.\n\nWord 2 and 14: 👽🦊🤑 = I-🦊-🤑 (3 letters). 3-letter words starting with \"i\": \"ice\", \"act\" (no), \"ink\", \"inn\", \"its\", \"it's\", \"ill\", \"irr\", \"ivy\", \"ion\", \"iron\", \"ire\", \"ice\", \"aye\" (no), \"eye\" (no). Let's think. If word 2 is \"its\", then 🦊=T, 🤑=S. Let's test that. So 👽=I, 🦊=T, 🤑=S. Then word 2: I-T-S → \"its\". That's a valid 3-letter word. Let's proceed.\n\nWord 3: 🐰🐵🤑🥵👽 = 🐰-🐵-S-A-I (5 letters). So the word is [🐰][🐵]SAI (5 letters). Let's think of 5-letter words ending with \"sai\". \"Basai\" (maybe a name), \"Casai\" (no), \"Masai\" (M-A-S-A-I → \"Masai\" is a valid word, referring to the Masai people). Oh! \"Masai\" is M-A-S-A-I. Let's check: [🐰]=M, [🐵]=A. But wait, 🥵=A, and each emoji is unique. So [🐵] can't be A. So that's a problem. Alternatively, \"Lisai\" (no), \"Pisai\" (no). Maybe \"tasai\" (no). Alternatively, maybe the word is \"basis\" (B-A-S-I-S). \"Basis\" is 5 letters: B-A-S-I-S. Let's check: [🐰]=B, [🐵]=A. Again, [🐵] can't be A (since 🥵=A). Not allowed. Another 5-letter word: \"faisa\" (no). \"Raisa\" (R-A-I-S-A → 5 letters). [🐰]=R, [🐵]=A → [🐵] can't be A. \"Kaisa\" (K-A-I-S-A). Same issue.\n\nAlternatively, if word 3 is \"brisa\" (B-R-I-S-A). 5 letters: B-R-I-S-A. So [🐰]=B, [🐵]=R. Then the word would be B-R-S-A-I → \"BRS AI\"? No, the structure is [🐰][🐵]🤑🥵👽 → [1][2] S A I. So 5 letters: [1][2]SAI. \"Brisa\" is B-R-I-S-A → 5 letters, but the structure here is [1][2]SAI → letters 1,2,S,A,I. \"Brisa\" would be B-R-I-S-A → which doesn't fit. \"Prisa\" (P-R-I-S-A) → same. \"Trisa\" (T-R-I-S-A) → same. \"Frisa\" (F-R-I-S-A) → same. \"Grisa\" (G-R-I-S-A) → same. \"Vrisa\" (no). \"Drisa\" (no). \"Crisa\" (no). \"Mrisa\" (no). \"Hrisa\" (no). \"Krisa\" (no). \"Lrisa\" (no). \"Srisa\" (no). \"Xrisa\" (no). \"Yrisa\" (no). \"Zrisa\" (no). So maybe \"visai\" (no). Alternatively, perhaps \"salsa\" (S-A-L-S-A → 5 letters). [🐰]=S, [🐵]=A → [🐵] can't be A. \"Samba\" (S-A-M-B-A → 5 letters). [🐵]=A → no. \"Salsa\" again.\n\nAlternatively, let's check word 11: 😈🥵👽🥵🥳🤓🥵 → 😈-A-I-A-E-🤓-A (7 letters). Structure: X-A-I-A-E-W-A. 7-letter words with A in positions 2,4,7. Let's think: \"cavalry\" (C-A-V-A-L-R-Y → 7 letters, positions 2=A, 4=A, 7=Y. No. \"marathon\" (M-A-R-A-T-H-O-N → 8 letters). \"sabotage\" (S-A-B-O-T-A-G-E → 8 letters). \"paradigm\" (P-A-R-A-D-I-G-M → 8 letters). \"catalyst\" (C-A-T-A-L-Y-S-T → 8 letters). \"fantasia\" (F-A-N-T-A-S-I-A → 8 letters). \"marauder\" (M-A-R-A-U-D-E-R → 8 letters). \"cavalier\" (C-A-V-A-L-I-E-R → 8 letters). Hmm. Maybe \"cascade\" (C-A-S-C-A-D-E → 7 letters). Structure: C-A-S-C-A-D-E. Positions 2=A, 4=C, 6=D, 7=E. Not matching. \"caravan\" (C-A-R-A-V-A-N → 7 letters: C-A-R-A-V-A-N. Structure: X-A-Y-A-Z-A-N. So positions 2=A,4=A,6=A. Our word 11 has positions 2=A,4=A,7=A. So \"caravan\" has A at 2,4,6. Not the same. \"catalpa\" (C-A-T-A-L-P-A → 7 letters: A at 2,4,7. Yes! \"Catalpa\" is a type of tree. Let's check: C-A-T-A-L-P-A → 7 letters. So positions 1=C, 2=A, 3=T, 4=A, 5=L, 6=P, 7=A. Our word 11 is 😈-A-I-A-E-🤓-A → X-A-I-A-E-W-A. So if \"catalpa\" were the word, it would need to have X=C, I=T, E=L, W=P. But let's check:\n\nIf word 11 is \"catalpa\", then:\n\n😈 = C (position 1)\n🥵=A (position 2)\n👽=T (position 3)\n🥵=A (position 4)\n🥳=L (position 5)\n🤓=P (position 6)\n🥵=A (position 7)\n\nBut earlier we thought 👽=I (from word 12 being \"if\"), but here 👽 would be T. Contradiction. So perhaps 👽 is not I. Let's backtrack.\n\nLet's consider another angle. The hint is 🥵=a, and we need to include that in the answer. The answer must list all known emojis (the hint and any correct guesses), so even if we only know 🥵=a, but we need to make a guess. However, the user expects us to make a guess, so even if we're not sure, we can propose possible mappings.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for the most frequent emoji. The hint says the most frequent emoji is given (🥵=a). Let's count the emojis in the encoded sentence to confirm.\n\nCount of each emoji:\n\n🥵: Let's count. Appears in positions:\n\n1. 🥵👽 → 1\n3. 🐰🐵🤑🥵👽 → 1\n4. 🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈 → 2 (positions 1 and 7)\n5. 🦁🥵👻🦊 → 1\n7. [not here]\n9. [not here]\n10. 🥺🤑😴🤑🥵👽🤑🥺 → 1\n11. 😈🥵👽🥵🥳🤓🥵 → 3 (positions 2,4,7)\n15. 🐶😈🥵🤫🐰🤫🐵🥵🥳 → 2 (positions 3 and 8)\n16. 🥺🐶🤧🥵👻 → 1\n17. 🐸🦊🥵🧐😇🐶🐱😈 → 1\nTotal 🥵 count: 1+1+2+1+1+3+2+1+1= 13 times. That's the most frequent, which matches the hint 🥵=a.\n\nNext, let's see other frequent emojis. Let's list all emojis and count:\n\n👽: word1 (1), word2 (1), word3 (1), word10 (1), word11 (1), word12 (1), word14 (1) → 7 times.\n\n🤑: word2 (1), word3 (1), word10 (3), word13 (1), word14 (1) → 1+1+3+1+1=7 times.\n\n🐵: word3 (1), word4 (1), word15 (1) → 3.\n\n🐸: word4 (1), word9 (2), word13 (1), word17 (1) → 5.\n\n🐱: word6 (1), word9 (2), word13 (1), word17 (1) → 5.\n\n😈: word4 (1), word6 (1), word11 (1), word15 (1), word17 (1) → 5.\n\n🥳: word7 (1), word9 (1), word11 (1), word15 (1) →4.\n\n🧐: word4 (1), word9 (1), word13 (1), word17 (1) →4.\n\n🐰: word3 (1), word15 (1) →2.\n\n🐶: word4 (1), word15 (1), word16 (1), word17 (1) →4.\n\n👻: word5 (1), word16 (1) →2.\n\n🥶: word7 (1) →1.\n\n🤫: word7 (1), word15 (2) →3.\n\n🤓: word7 (1), word11 (1) →2.\n\n20, 2008: numbers.\n\n🥺: word10 (2), word16 (1) →3.\n\n😴: word10 (1) →1.\n\n🤧: word16 (1) →1.\n\n😇: word17 (1) →1.\n\n🦁: word5 (1), word13 (1) →2.\n\nSo 👽 and 🤑 each appear 7 times, next after 🥵.\n\nSince 👽 and 🤑 are frequent, they might be common letters like t, o, i, n, s, h, r, d, l, etc.\n\nGiven that word 2 and 14 are 👽🦊🤑 (3 letters), and 3-letter words are often \"the\", \"and\", \"for\", \"are\", \"but\", \"not\", \"you\", \"all\", \"any\", \"can\", \"had\", \"has\", \"her\", \"his\", \"its\", \"may\", \"out\", \"was\", \"who\", \"your\".\n\nIf 👽🦊🤑 is \"the\", then 👽=t, 🦊=h, 🤑=e. Let's test that.\n\nIf 👽=t, 🦊=h, 🤑=e.\n\nWord 1: 🥵👽=a-t → \"at\" (valid 2-letter word). Good.\n\nWord 12: 👽🐱=t-🐱 (2 letters). 2-letter words with t: \"to\", \"ta\", \"te\", \"ti\", \"tu\", \"ts\", \"tw\", \"ty\", \"tb\" (no). \"To\" is common. So if 🐱=o, then 👽🐱=t-o → \"to\". That works.\n\nWord 6: 🐱😈=o-😈 (2 letters). 2-letter words with o: \"of\", \"on\", \"or\", \"ok\", \"oh\", \"ow\", \"oi\", \"oe\". Let's say \"of\" → 😈=f. So 🐱=o, 😈=f. Then word 6: o-f → \"of\".\n\nWord 9: 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳=🧐-🐸-🐸-o-o-🥳 (6 letters). Structure X-Y-Y-O-O-Q. Let's think of 6-letter words with \"oo\" in the middle. \"Broomy\" (B-R-O-O-M-Y → 6 letters: B-R-O-O-M-Y. Structure X=B, Y=R, Q=M → X-Y-Y-O-O-Q → B-R-R-O-O-M → \"BRROOM\" → \"broom\" is 5 letters (B-R-O-O-M). \"Broomy\" is 6 letters, but the structure would be B-R-O-O-M-Y. Not matching. \"Spoony\" (S-P-O-O-N-Y → 6 letters: S-P-O-O-N-Y → X=S, Y=P, Q=N → X-Y-Y-O-O-Q → S-P-P-O-O-N → \"SPPOON\" → \"spoon\" is 5 letters (S-P-O-O-N). \"Snoopy\" (S-N-O-O-P-Y → 6 letters: S-N-O-O-P-Y → X=S, Y=N, Q=P → X-Y-Y-O-O-Q → S-N-N-O-O-P → \"SNN OOP\" → no. \"Googly\" (G-O-O-G-L-Y → 6 letters: G-O-O-G-L-Y → structure X=G, Y=O, Z=G, Q=L → X-Y-Y-Z-Z-Q → G-O-O-G-G-L → \"GOO GGL\" → no. \"Toothy\" (T-O-O-T-H-Y → 6 letters: T-O-O-T-H-Y → structure X=T, Y=O, Z=T, Q=H → X-Y-Y-Z-Z-Q → T-O-O-T-T-H → \"TOOTT H\" → no. \"Bloomy\" (B-L-O-O-M-Y → 6 letters: B-L-O-O-M-Y → structure X=B, Y=L, Q=M → X-Y-Y-O-O-Q → B-L-L-O-O-M → \"BLL OOM\" → \"bloom\" is 5 letters. \"Droopy\" (D-R-O-O-P-Y → 6 letters: D-R-O-O-P-Y → structure X=D, Y=R, Q=P → X-Y-Y-O-O-Q → D-R-R-O-O-P → \"DRR OOP\" → \"droop\" is 5 letters. \"Floozy\" (F-L-O-O-Z-Y → 6 letters: F-L-O-O-Z-Y → structure X=F, Y=L, Q=Z → X-Y-Y-O-O-Q → F-L-L-O-O-Z → \"FLL OOZ\" → no. \"Moosey\" (M-O-O-S-E-Y → 6 letters: M-O-O-S-E-Y → structure X=M, Y=O, Z=S, Q=E → X-Y-Y-Z-Z-Q → M-O-O-S-S-E → \"MOO SSE\" → \"moose\" is 5 letters. \"Roomy\" (R-O-O-M-Y → 6 letters: R-O-O-M-Y → structure X=R, Y=O, Q=M → X-Y-Y-O-O-Q → R-O-O-O-O-M → no, \"roomy\" is R-O-O-M-Y → 5 letters (R-O-O-M-Y is 6 letters? R-O-O-M-Y is 6 letters. So R-O-O-M-Y → structure X=R, Y=O, Z=M, Q=Y → X-Y-Y-Z-Z-Q → R-O-O-M-M-Y → no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe word 9 is \"coffee\" as before. If 🐱=f (from earlier), but we thought 🐱=o here. Contradiction. Let's try another approach.\n\nWord 7: 🥶🤫🥳🤓 (4 letters). If we assume common 4-letter words: \"this\", \"that\", \"with\", \"have\", \"will\", \"your\", \"from\", \"they\", \"know\", \"want\", \"been\", \"good\", \"much\", \"some\", \"time\".\n\nWord 11: 😈🥵👽🥵🥳🤓🥵 → 😈-a-👽-a-🥳-🤓-a (7 letters). Let's say it's \"fantasia\" (but 8 letters). \"Catalyst\" (8 letters). \"Marathon\" (8 letters). \"Paradigm\" (8 letters). \"Banalize\" (8 letters). \"Banalize\" is B-A-N-A-L-I-Z-E → 8 letters. No. \"Marauder\" (8 letters). \"Caravan\" (7 letters: C-A-R-A-V-A-N). Structure C-A-R-A-V-A-N → 7 letters. So positions 1=C, 2=A, 3=R, 4=A,5=V,6=A,7=N. Our word 11 is X-A-Y-A-Z-W-A → so X=C, Y=R, Z=V, W=A, but W is 🤓, and A is already 🥵. Not possible.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the encoded sentence might be about a date, since there are \"20, 2008\" in it. So maybe the sentence is a news snippet or an event.\n\nAnother approach: since we know 🥵=a, and we need to make a guess, even if it's a partial one. The answer must include the hint (🥵=a) and any guesses. Since it's the first attempt, we can propose possible mappings based on frequency and common words.\n\nLet's list the known emoji: 🥵=a.\n\nOther frequent emojis: 👽 (7), 🤑 (7), 🐸 (5), 🐱 (5), 😈 (5), 🧐 (4), 🐶 (4), etc.\n\nCommon letters: e, t, a, o, i, n, s, h, r, d, l, c, u, m, w, f, g, y, p, b, v, k, j, x, q, z.\n\nSince 👽 and 🤑 are the next most frequent (7 each), they could be t, e, o, i, n, s.\n\nAssume 👽=t (since \"the\" is the most common 3-letter word), then word 2 and 14 (👽🦊🤑) would be t-🦊-🤑. If it's \"the\", then 🦊=h, 🤑=e. Let's try:\n\n👽=t, 🦊=h, 🤑=e.\n\nWord 1: 🥵👽=a-t → \"at\" (valid).\n\nWord 3: 🐰🐵🤑🥵👽=🐰-🐵-e-a-t → 5 letters. \"create\" is 6 letters. \"crate\" (c-r-a-t-e → 5 letters). So [🐰]=c, [🐵]=r. Then word 3: c-r-e-a-t → \"create\" is 6 letters. \"crate\" is 5 letters: c-r-a-t-e. So the structure is 🐰-🐵-e-a-t → c-r-e-a-t → \"create\" (6 letters). No. \"grate\" (g-r-a-t-e → 5 letters). So [🐰]=g, [🐵]=r. Then word 3: g-r-e-a-t → \"great\" (5 letters). Oh! \"great\" is G-R-E-A-T. Yes! So:\n\n🐰=g, 🐵=r, 🤑=e, 🥵=a, 👽=t. Then word 3: g-r-e-a-t → \"great\". Perfect! That fits. Let's check:\n\nword 3: 🐰🐵🤑🥵👽 → g-r-e-a-t → \"great\". Correct.\n\nWord 2 and 14: 👽🦊🤑 → t-🦊-e. If this is \"the\", then 🦊=h. So 🦊=h. Then word 2: t-h-e → \"the\". Correct.\n\nNow, word 4: 🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈 → a-🧐-e-r-🐶-🐸-a-😈 (8 letters). Let's think of 8-letter words starting with \"a\". \"Amazing\" (7 letters), \"Awesome\" (7 letters), \"Activity\" (8 letters: A-C-T-I-V-I-T-Y). Structure A-C-T-I-V-I-T-Y. Our word 4 is a-🧐-e-r-🐶-🐸-a-😈 → a-X-e-r-Y-Z-a-W. Let's see \"Activity\" would be A-C-T-I-V-I-T-Y → 8 letters. So:\n\na (1), C (2), T (3), I (4), V (5), I (6), T (7), Y (8).\n\nBut our structure is a-X-e-r-Y-Z-a-W. So positions 1=a, 2=X, 3=e, 4=r, 5=Y, 6=Z, 7=a, 8=W. \"Activity\" doesn't fit. \"Available\" (A-V-A-I-L-A-B-L-E → 9 letters). \"Absolutely\" (9 letters). \"Actually\" (8 letters: A-C-T-U-A-L-L-Y). Structure A-C-T-U-A-L-L-Y. Our word 4: a-X-e-r-Y-Z-a-W → a-C-e-r-U-A-L-Y → \"aceru aly\"? No. \"Actually\" is A-C-T-U-A-L-L-Y → 8 letters: positions 1=A, 2=C, 3=T, 4=U, 5=A, 6=L, 7=L, 8=Y. Not matching.\n\nAnother 8-letter word: \"Adventure\" (A-D-V-E-N-T-U-R-E → 9 letters). \"Aftermath\" (A-F-T-E-R-M-A-T-H → 9 letters). \"Airplane\" (A-I-R-P-L-A-N-E → 8 letters). Structure A-I-R-P-L-A-N-E. Our word 4: a-X-e-r-Y-Z-a-W → a-I-e-r-P-L-a-N → \"aierplaN\" → \"airplane\" is A-I-R-P-L-A-N-E → 8 letters. Let's check:\n\na (1), I (2), e (3), r (4), P (5), L (6), a (7), N (8). So:\n\n🧐=I (position 2)\n🤑=e (position 3)\n🐵=r (position 4)\n🐶=P (position 5)\n🐸=L (position 6)\n🥵=a (position 7)\n😈=N (position 8)\n\nSo word 4: a-I-e-r-P-L-a-N → \"airplane\". That's a valid 8-letter word! Perfect. Let's verify:\n\n\"airplane\" is A-I-R-P-L-A-N-E. Wait, \"airplane\" is A-I-R-P-L-A-N-E (8 letters: A I R P L A N E). So positions 1=A, 2=I, 3=R, 4=P, 5=L, 6=A, 7=N, 8=E. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the structure. Let's recount the emojis in word 4: 🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈 → 8 emojis. So the letters are:\n\n1: 🥵=a\n\n2: 🧐=?\n\n3: 🤑=e (from earlier)\n\n4: 🐵=r (from earlier)\n\n5: 🐶=?\n\n6: 🐸=?\n\n7: 🥵=a\n\n8: 😈=?\n\nSo the word is a-🧐-e-r-🐶-🐸-a-😈. Let's think of 8-letter words with a at positions 1 and 7. For example, \"aftermath\" (A-F-T-E-R-M-A-T-H → 9 letters). \"anywhere\" (A-N-Y-W-H-E-R-E → 8 letters: A N Y W H E R E → positions 1=A, 7=R, 8=E. No. \"backbone\" (B-A-C-K-B-O-N-E → 8 letters. No a at 7. \"baseball\" (B-A-S-E-B-A-L-L → 8 letters: A at 2 and 6. No. \"basketry\" (B-A-S-K-E-T-R-Y → 8 letters: A at 2. No. \"beforehand\" (9 letters). \"birthday\" (B-I-R-T-H-D-A-Y → 8 letters: A at 7. Yes! \"birthday\" is B-I-R-T-H-D-A-Y. Structure: B-I-R-T-H-D-A-Y. 8 letters. So:\n\nposition 1: B (not a, so no). \"Cavalry\" (C-A-V-A-L-R-Y → 7 letters). \"Chamber\" (C-H-A-M-B-E-R → 7 letters). \"Chateau\" (C-H-A-T-E-A-U → 7 letters). \"Classify\" (C-L-A-S-S-I-F-Y → 8 letters: A at 3. No. \"Cleanest\" (C-L-E-A-N-E-S-T → 8 letters: A at 4. No. \"Clearway\" (C-L-E-A-R-W-A-Y → 8 letters: A at 4 and 7. Yes! \"Clearway\" is C-L-E-A-R-W-A-Y. Structure: C-L-E-A-R-W-A-Y (8 letters). Let's check:\n\nposition 1: C → not a. No. \"Createur\" (French, 8 letters). \"Dangerous\" (D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S → 9 letters). \"Daredevil\" (D-A-R-E-D-E-V-I-L → 9 letters). \"Daybreak\" (D-A-Y-B-R-E-A-K → 8 letters: A at 2 and 7. Yes! \"Daybreak\" is D-A-Y-B-R-E-A-K (8 letters). Structure: D-A-Y-B-R-E-A-K. So positions 1=D, 2=A, 3=Y, 4=B, 5=R, 6=E, 7=A, 8=K. Our word 4 is a-🧐-e-r-🐶-🐸-a-😈 → a (1), 🧐 (2), e (3), r (4), 🐶 (5), 🐸 (6), a (7), 😈 (8). So if \"daybreak\" were the word, it would need to be a-Y-e-r-B-E-a-K → \"aYerBEaK\". Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, \"everyday\" (E-V-E-R-Y-D-A-Y → 8 letters: E at 1, A at 7. No. \"Everybody\" (E-V-E-R-Y-B-O-D-Y → 9 letters). \"Everything\" (E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G → 9 letters). \"Everytime\" (E-V-E-R-Y-T-I-M-E → 9 letters). \"Firearms\" (F-I-R-E-A-R-M-S → 8 letters: A at 5. No. \"Fireball\" (F-I-R-E-B-A-L-L → 8 letters: A at 6. No. \"First aid\" (no, 2 words). \"Fishing\" (7 letters). \"Following\" (8 letters: F-O-L-L-O-W-I-N-G. No a. \"Footwear\" (F-O-O-T-W-E-A-R → 8 letters: A at 7. Yes! \"Footwear\" is F-O-O-T-W-E-A-R (8 letters). Structure: F-O-O-T-W-E-A-R. So positions 1=F, 2=O, 3=O, 4=T, 5=W, 6=E, 7=A, 8=R. Our word 4 is a-🧐-e-r-🐶-🐸-a-😈 → a (1), 🧐 (2), e (3), r (4), 🐶 (5), 🐸 (6), a (7), 😈 (8). So \"footwear\" would need to be a-O-e-r-W-E-a-R → \"aOerWEaR\". Not matching.\n\nLet's try a different approach. Let's assume word 5: 🦁🥵👻🦊 → 🦁-a-👻-h (since 🦊=h from earlier). 4-letter words with a and h. \"Bath\" (B-A-T-H → 4 letters). So if 🦁=b, 👻=t, then word 5: b-a-t-h → \"bath\". That works. So:\n\n🦁=b, 👻=t.\n\nWord 5: 🦁🥵👻🦊 → b-a-t-h → \"bath\". Correct.\n\nWord 16: 🥺🐶🤧🥵👻 → 🥺-🐶-🤧-a-t (6 letters). 6-letter words ending with \"at\". \"Blat\" (4 letters), \"Brats\" (5), \"Chats\" (5), \"Coat\" (4), \"Dats\" (4), \"Eats\" (4), \"Fats\" (4), \"Gnats\" (5), \"Hats\" (4), \"Jats\" (4), \"Kats\" (4), \"Lats\" (4), \"Mats\" (4), \"Nats\" (4), \"Pats\" (4), \"Rats\" (4), \"Sats\" (4), \"Tats\" (4), \"Vats\" (4), \"Wats\" (4), \"Yats\" (4), \"Zats\" (4). 6-letter words ending with \"at\": \"Beretat\" (no), \"Blowat\" (no), \"Chattat\" (no). Maybe \"Chinat\" (no). Alternatively, \"Basket\" (B-A-S-K-E-T → 6 letters). No. \"Carpet\" (C-A-R-P-E-T → 6 letters). Structure C-A-R-P-E-T. Our word 16 is X-Y-Z-a-t. Not matching.\n\nWord 13: 🦁🤑🐸🐱🧐🤑 → b-e-🐸-🐱-🧐-e (6 letters). 6-letter words with \"e\" at positions 2 and 6. \"Basket\" (B-A-S-K-E-T → 6 letters. No e at 6. \"Bounce\" (B-O-U-N-C-E → 6 letters: e at 6. Structure B-O-U-N-C-E. So:\n\n🦁=b, 🤑=e, 🐸=o, 🐱=u, 🧐=n, 🤑=e → word 13: b-e-o-u-n-e → \"bounce\". That works! \"Bounce\" is B-O-U-N-C-E. Wait, \"bounce\" is B-O-U-N-C-E (6 letters). So:\n\n🦁=b, 🤑=e, 🐸=o, 🐱=u, 🧐=n, 🤑=e → word 13: b-e-o-u-n-e → \"bounce\". Perfect! Let's verify:\n\nword 13: 🦁🤑🐸🐱🧐🤑 → b-e-o-u-n-e → \"bounce\". Correct.\n\nNow, let's update our mappings:\n\n🥵=a (given)\n👽=t (from word1: a-t=at)\n🦊=h (from word2: t-h-e=the)\n🤑=e (from word2: the)\n🐰=g (from word3: g-r-e-a-t=great)\n🐵=r (from word3: great)\n🦁=b (from word5: b-a-t-h=bath)\n👻=t (from word5: bath) → Wait, 👻=t, but 👽=t. Oh no! Each emoji must represent a unique letter. So 👻 can't be t. That's a mistake. So word5: 🦁🥵👻🦊 → b-a-👻-h. If 👻 can't be t (since 👽=t), then 👻 must be another letter. Let's think of 4-letter words with a and h: \"Cath\" (C-A-T-H), \"Dath\" (no), \"Fath\" (F-A-T-H → \"fath\" is short for father, but not common), \"Gath\" (G-A-T-H → a place in the Bible), \"Hath\" (H-A-T-H → archaic for \"has\"), \"Kath\" (name), \"Lath\" (L-A-T-H → a thin strip of wood), \"Meth\" (M-E-T-H → no, but \"meth\" is a drug), \"Path\" (P-A-T-H), \"Rath\" (R-A-T-H → a type of fort), \"Sath\" (no), \"Tath\" (no), \"Vath\" (no), \"Wath\" (no), \"Yath\" (no), \"Zath\" (no). So \"path\" is P-A-T-H. So if 🦁=p, 👻=t, then word5: p-a-t-h → \"path\". But 👻=t, 👽=t (duplicate). Not allowed. \"lath\" is L-A-T-H. 🦁=l, 👻=t → duplicate t. \"hath\" is H-A-T-H → 🦁=h, but 🦊=h (duplicate). \"gath\" → G-A-T-H. 🦁=g, 👻=t. But 🐰=g (from word3: great), so duplicate g. \"cath\" → C-A-T-H. 🦁=c, 👻=t. So 👻=t (duplicate with 👽=t). No good. \"dath\" → D-A-T-H. 🦁=d, 👻=t (duplicate). So perhaps word5 isn't \"bath\" or \"path\". Let's try 4-letter words with a and h but not ending with th. \"Chad\" (C-H-A-D → 4 letters). No a in the middle. \"Haze\" (H-A-Z-E → 4 letters. No h at the end. \"Hare\" (H-A-R-E → 4 letters). No. \"Hate\" (H-A-T-E → 4 letters). No. \"Have\" (H-A-V-E → 4 letters). No. \"Hawk\" (H-A-W-K → 4 letters). No. \"Halt\" (H-A-L-T → 4 letters). No. \"Hand\" (H-A-N-D → 4 letters). No. \"Harm\" (H-A-R-M → 4 letters). No. \"Hart\" (H-A-R-T → 4 letters). No. \"Hash\" (H-A-S-H → 4 letters: H-A-S-H. So 🦁=h (but 🦊=h), duplicate. \"Half\" (H-A-L-F → 4 letters). No. \"Hack\" (H-A-C-K → 4 letters). No. \"Back\" (B-A-C-K → 4 letters). No h. \"Bach\" (B-A-C-H → 4 letters). Yes! \"Bach\" is B-A-C-H (4 letters). So if 🦁=b, 👻=c, then word5: b-a-c-h → \"bach\". That works. And 👻=c (unique). Let's check:\n\nword5: 🦁🥵👻🦊 → b-a-c-h → \"bach\". Correct. 👻=c (new letter, not used before). Good.\n\nNow, word 13: 🦁🤑🐸🐱🧐🤑 → b-e-🐸-🐱-🧐-e (6 letters). 6-letter words with \"e\" at positions 2 and 6. \"Basket\" (B-A-S-K-E-T → e at 5. No. \"Bounce\" (B-O-U-N-C-E → e at 6. Structure B-O-U-N-C-E. So:\n\n🦁=b, 🤑=e, 🐸=o, 🐱=u, 🧐=n, 🤑=e → word13: b-e-o-u-n-e → \"bounce\". Correct. So:\n\n🐸=o, 🐱=u, 🧐=n.\n\nWord 9: 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳 → n-o-o-u-u-🥳 (6 letters). Structure n-o-o-u-u-Q. 6-letter words with \"oo\" and \"uu\"? Unlikely. Maybe \"spooky\" (S-P-O-O-K-Y → 6 letters. No uu. \"Spoof\" (5 letters). \"Smooth\" (S-M-O-O-T-H → 6 letters. Structure S-M-O-O-T-H. No uu. \"Boonie\" (B-O-O-N-I-E → 6 letters. Structure B-O-O-N-I-E. No uu. \"Roomie\" (R-O-O-M-I-E → 6 letters. No uu. \"Tooth\" (5 letters). \"Toodle\" (T-O-O-D-L-E → 6 letters. Structure T-O-O-D-L-E. No uu. \"Boodle\" (B-O-O-D-L-E → 6 letters. Structure B-O-O-D-L-E. No uu. \"Doodle\" (D-O-O-D-L-E → 6 letters). No uu. \"Googly\" (G-O-O-G-L-Y → 6 letters). No uu. \"Moose\" (5 letters). \"Noose\" (5 letters). \"Poopoo\" (P-O-O-P-O-O → 6 letters, but it's informal). \"Poopoo\" is P-O-O-P-O-O → structure P-O-O-P-O-O. So if word9 is \"poopoo\", then 🧐=p, 🐸=o, 🐱=p, 🥳=o. But we had 🧐=n earlier, which conflicts. So perhaps my earlier assumption of 🧐=n is wrong.\n\nLet's backtrack. We had word 13: 🦁🤑🐸🐱🧐🤑 → if 🦁=b, 🤑=e, and the word is \"bounce\" (B-O-U-N-C-E), then:\n\n🦁=b, 🤑=e, 🐸=o, 🐱=u, 🧐=n, 🤑=e → \"bounce\" (B-O-U-N-C-E). Correct. So that works. Then word 9: 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳 = n-o-o-u-u-🥳 (6 letters). Maybe \"noonuu\" (no), \"nuouuu\" (no). Not a word. So perhaps word 9 isn't \"coffee\" and my earlier assumption was wrong.\n\nLet's try to proceed with the mappings we have so far:\n\n🥵=a (given)\n👽=t (word1: at)\n🦊=h (word2: the)\n🤑=e (word2: the)\n🐰=g (word3: great)\n🐵=r (word3: great)\n🦁=b (word5: bach)\n👻=c (word5: bach)\n🐸=o (word13: bounce)\n🐱=u (word13: bounce)\n🧐=n (word13: bounce)\n\nNow, word 6: 🐱😈 = u-😈 (2 letters). 2-letter words with u: \"up\", \"us\", \"um\", \"un\", \"ut\", \"uh\", \"uv\" (no), \"ux\" (no), \"uy\" (no). \"up\" is common. So 😈=p. Then word6: u-p → \"up\".\n\nWord 12: 👽🐱 = t-u → \"tu\". \"Tu\" is a valid word (informal for \"you\" in some contexts, or a noun). Alternatively, \"tu\" is a prefix, but it's a valid 2-letter word.\n\nWord 7: 🥶🤫🥳🤓 (4 letters). Let's assume it's \"that\" (t-h-a-t), but letters don't match. Or \"this\" (t-h-i-s). Not sure. Let's leave it for now.\n\nWord 11: 😈🥵👽🥵🥳🤓🥵 → p-a-t-a-🥳-🤓-a (7 letters). 7-letter words with a at positions 2,4,7. \"Pataka\" (P-A-T-A-K-A → 6 letters). \"Patina\" (P-A-T-I-N-A → 6 letters). \"Patina\" is 6 letters. \"Patatas\" (P-A-T-A-T-A-S → 7 letters. Spanish for potatoes). \"Patatas\" → P-A-T-A-T-A-S. Structure P-A-T-A-T-A-S. Our word 11: p-a-t-a-🥳-🤓-a → p-a-t-a-T-A-a → \"patataa\" (no). \"Paradigm\" (P-A-R-A-D-I-G-M → 8 letters). \"Panacea\" (P-A-N-A-C-E-A → 7 letters). \"Panacea\" is P-A-N-A-C-E-A → 7 letters. So:\n\n😈=p, 🥵=a, 👽=t, 🥵=a, 🥳=c, 🤓=e, 🥵=a → word11: p-a-t-a-c-e-a → \"patacea\". Not a word. \"Panacea\" is P-A-N-A-C-E-A → 7 letters. So if 🥳=c, 🤓=e, then word11: p-a-t-a-c-e-a → \"patacea\" (no). \"Pajamas\" (P-A-J-A-M-A-S → 7 letters). Structure P-A-J-A-M-A-S. Our word 11: p-a-t-a-M-A-a → \"patamaa\" (no).\n\nThis is getting complicated. Given that this is the first attempt, and we need to make a guess, let's list the mappings we've deduced so far (even if some might be incorrect) and include the hint.\n\nSo far, our guesses would be:\n\n🥵=a (given)\n👽=t\n🦊=h\n🤑=e\n🐰=g\n🐵=r\n🦁=b\n👻=c\n🐸=o\n🐱=u\n🧐=n\n😈=p\n\nWe need to include all these in the answer, even if some are wrong. The answer should be in the format 'emoji=word' separated by commas.\n\n🥵=a,👽=t,🦊=h,🤑=e,🐰=g,🐵=r,🦁=b,👻=c,🐸=o,🐱=u,🧐=n,😈=p\nAnswer: 🥵=a,👽=t,🦊=h,🤑=e,🐰=g,🐵=r,🦁=b,👻=c,🐸=o,🐱=u,🧐=n,😈=p","Okay, let's try to figure out the correct emojis for this round. First, let's recall the information we have. The encoded sentence uses emojis where each represents a unique letter. The hint is 🥵=a, which was confirmed correct in the first attempt. The first guess included several emojis, and the feedback tells us which were correct.\n\nFrom the first attempt's feedback: 🥵=a (correct), 👽=t (correct), 🦊=h (correct), 🤑=e (correct), 🐰=g (correct), 🐵=r (correct), 🦁=b (correct). The ones that were wrong are 👻, 🐸, 🐱, 🧐, 😈.\n\nLet's start by substituting the known emojis into the encoded sentence to see if we can find patterns. Let's list the encoded sentence with the correct substitutions:\n\nEncoded Sentence (after substitution):\na t   t h e   g r e a t   a ? e r ? ? a p   b a ? h   ? p   ? ? ? ?   20, 2008, ? ? ? ? ? ?   ? e ? e a t e ?   p a t a ? ? a   t ?   b e ? ? ? e   t h e   ? p a ? g ? r a ?   ? ? ? a ?   ? h a ? ? ? ? p.\n\nWait, let's break it down word by word, substituting each known emoji:\n\nOriginal Encoded Sentence:\n🥵👽 → a t\n👽🦊🤑 → t h e\n🐰🐵🤑🥵👽 → g r e a t\n🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈 → a [🧐] e r [🐶] [🐸] a [😈]\n🦁🥵👻🦊 → b a [👻] h\n🐱😈 → [🐱] [😈]\n🥶🤫🥳🤓 → [🥶][🤫][🥳][🤓]\n20, 2008, 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳 → [🧐] o o [🐱][🐱][🥳] (Wait, no, in the first guess, 🐸 was guessed as o, but feedback said 🐸 is False. So 🐸 is not o. Similarly, 🐱 was guessed as u, but that's False. So 🐸 and 🐱 are not o and u. So the part 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳 would be [🧐][🐸][🐸][🐱][🐱][🥳].\n🥺🤑😴🤑🥵👽🤑🥺 → [🥺] e [😴] e a t e [🥺]\n😈🥵👽🥵🥳🤓🥵 → [😈] a t a [🥳][🤓] a\n👽🐱 → t [🐱]\n🦁🤑🐸🐱🧐🤑 → b e [🐸][🐱][🧐] e\n👽🦊🤑 → t h e\n🐶😈🥵🤫🐰🤫🐵🥵🥳 → [🐶][😈] a [🤫] g [🤫] r a [🥳]\n🥺🐶🤧🥵👻 → [🥺][🐶][🤧] a [👻]\n🐸🦊🥵🧐😇🐶🐱😈 → [🐸] h a [🧐][😇][🐶][🐱][😈]\n\nLet's look at the known correct words first. The third word is 🐰🐵🤑🥵👽 → g r e a t. That makes sense, \"great\" is a common word, so that's correct. The first two words: 🥵👽=a t → \"at\", and 👽🦊🤑=t h e → \"the\". So that's \"At the great...\" which is a good start.\n\nNext, the fourth word: 🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈 → a [X] e r [Y] [Z] a [W]. Let's see. \"a X e r Y Z a W\". Let's think of possible words here. Maybe \"a certain...\"? Let's check: \"a certain\" is 7 letters. Let's count the letters in the fourth word. The encoded word has 8 emojis: 🥵(a), 🧐(X), 🤑(e), 🐵(r), 🐶(Y), 🐸(Z), 🥵(a), 😈(W). So 8 letters. \"a X e r Y Z a W\" → 8 letters. Let's think of possible 8-letter words starting with a, followed by X, e, r. Maybe \"a...er...a...\". For example, \"a matter of...\"? No, but let's think. Alternatively, \"a ...er...a...\".\n\nLooking at the fifth word: 🦁🥵👻🦊 → b a [Q] h. \"baQh\" → maybe \"bath\"? But 👻 was guessed as c (so 'bath' would be b a t h, but 👻 was supposed to be c, which was wrong. So 👻 is not c. So \"baQh\" → if \"bath\" is possible, then 👻 would be t. But 👽 is t. Oh, emojis are unique, so 👻 can't be t. So \"baQh\" → maybe \"barnh\"? No. Maybe \"b a l h\"? \"bahl\"? Not a word. Maybe \"b a s h\"? So 👻=s. \"bash\" is a word. So 👻 could be s. Let's keep that in mind.\n\nThe sixth word: 🐱😈 → [R][W]. Let's hold that for now.\n\nThe seventh word: 🥶🤫🥳🤓 → 4 emojis, 4 letters. Maybe a date or a word. Let's check the next part: \"20, 2008, 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳\". The \"20, 2008\" is probably part of the sentence, maybe \"20, 2008, [something]\". The part after is 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳 → X Z Z R R [S]. Let's say \"XZZRR S\". Maybe \"June 20, 2008\" → but 20, 2008 would be day, year. Maybe \"20, 2008, [month]\". For example, \"May 20, 2008\" → but \"May\" is 3 letters, the part here is 6 emojis (X Z Z R R S). So 6 letters. Maybe \"June 20, 2008\" → but \"June\" is 4 letters. Alternatively, \"March 20, 2008\" → 5 letters. Hmm. Let's think of 6-letter months: \"January\" is 7, \"February\" 8, \"March\" 5, \"April\" 5, \"May\" 3, \"June\" 4, \"July\" 4, \"August\" 6. Oh, August is 6 letters. So \"August 20, 2008\". Let's check: August → A U G U S T. So letters: A U G U S T. Let's see: the part is X Z Z R R S. If \"August\" is the word, then X=A, Z=U, R=G, S=T. But wait, 🥵 is a, so X (🧐) can't be A (since a is already taken by 🥵). So that's not possible. Alternatively, \"August\" starts with A, which is already used. Maybe \"Monday\"? No. Let's look at the next part.\n\nThe eighth word: 🥺🤑😴🤑🥵👽🤑🥺 → [T] e [U] e a t e [T]. So structure: T e U e a t e T. That's 8 letters. Let's think of a word that starts and ends with T, with \"eate\" in the middle. Maybe \"teletype\"? Let's check: T E L E T Y P E → No, structure is T e U e a t e T. So positions: 1=T, 2=e, 3=U, 4=e, 5=a, 6=t, 7=e, 8=T. So \"T e U e a t e T\". Let's see: \"T e l e a t e T\"? \"TeleateT\"? Not a word. Alternatively, \"T e s e a t e T\"? \"TeseateT\"? Maybe \"theater\" but that's 7 letters. Alternatively, maybe it's a different structure. Maybe it's a phrase, but perhaps it's a name.\n\nThe ninth word: 😈🥵👽🥵🥳🤓🥵 → W a t a S N a. Structure: W a t a S N a. 7 letters. Maybe \"Walter a\"? No. \"W a t a ... a\". Maybe \"Walter a\"? Not sure.\n\nTenth word: 👽🐱 → t R. So \"t R\" could be \"to\", \"te\", \"th\" (but h is 🦊), \"ts\", \"tr\" (r is 🐵), \"tw\", \"ty\". So R (🐱) could be o, e, s, w, y, etc.\n\nEleventh word: 🦁🤑🐸🐱🧐🤑 → b e Z R X e. So \"b e Z R X e\". 6 letters. Let's think: \"b e ... e\". Maybe \"b e c o m e\"? But Z would be c, R=o, X=m. But let's check if that fits. If \"become\" → b e c o m e. So Z (🐸)=c, R (🐱)=o, X (🧐)=m. Let's see if that works. Let's check the fourth word again: a X e r Y Z a W → a m e r Y c a W. So \"amerYcaW\". Maybe \"America...\"? \"America\" is 7 letters. The fourth word is 8 letters: a m e r Y c a W. \"AmericaW\"? If W (😈) is n, then \"American\" (8 letters). Let's check: \"American\" → A M E R I C A N. So a (🥵) m (🧐) e (🤑) r (🐵) i (🐶) c (🐸) a (🥵) n (😈). Oh! That fits! Let's check:\n\nFourth word: 🥵(a) 🧐(m) 🤑(e) 🐵(r) 🐶(i) 🐸(c) 🥵(a) 😈(n) → \"american\". That's 8 letters, perfect. So that would make sense. Let's verify:\n\n- 🧐=m (since the fourth word's second emoji is 🧐, which would be m here)\n- 🐶=i (fourth word's fifth emoji)\n- 🐸=c (fourth word's sixth emoji)\n- 😈=n (fourth word's eighth emoji)\n\nLet's check if these make sense in other parts.\n\nLet's check the fifth word: 🦁(b) 🥵(a) 👻(?) 🦊(h) → \"ba?h\". If \"b a s h\" (bash), then 👻=s. Let's see if that works.\n\nEleventh word: 🦁(b) 🤑(e) 🐸(c) 🐱(?) 🧐(m) 🤑(e) → \"b e c ? m e\". What's a 6-letter word here? \"b e c o m e\" (become). So \"become\" → b e c o m e. So 🐱=o (since the fourth emoji in the word is 🐱, which would be o). Let's check if that's possible.\n\nTenth word: 👽(t) 🐱(o) → \"to\". That's a common word, makes sense. So 🐱=o.\n\nLet's check the sixth word: 🐱(o) 😈(n) → \"on\". That's a common word. Perfect.\n\nThe seventh word: 🥶🤫🥳🤓 → let's see. The sentence has \"20, 2008, 🧐(m) 🐸(c) 🐸(c) 🐱(o) 🐱(o) 🥳(?)\". So that part would be \"m c c o o [🥳]\". So \"mccoo[🥳]\". Maybe \"mccook\"? \"Mccook\" is a place (Mccook, Nebraska). So if 🥳=k, then \"mccook\". Let's check. \"20, 2008, Mccook\" → maybe a date and a location. So 🥳=k.\n\nThen the seventh word: 🥶🤫🥳(k) 🤓(?) → \"🥶🤫k?\". Let's see. The seventh word is before \"20, 2008\", so maybe a date like \"May 20, 2008\" but \"May\" is 3 letters, but the seventh word is 4 emojis. \"April\" is 5 letters. Alternatively, \"June\" (4 letters). Let's see: \"June\" → J U N E. So if 🥶=j, 🤫=u, 🥳=n, 🤓=e. But earlier we thought 🥳=k (from mccook), which may conflict. Let's check the ninth word again: 😈(n) 🥵(a) 👽(t) 🥵(a) 🥳(k) 🤓(?) 🥵(a) → \"n a t a k ? a\". Maybe \"n a t a k a\" (but that's 6 letters). \"Nataka\" could be a name. Alternatively, if 🥳=s, then \"n a t a s ? a\". \"Natasia\"? Maybe. Let's try another angle.\n\nThe twelfth word: 👽(t) 🦊(h) 🤑(e) → \"the\", which is correct.\n\nThirteenth word: 🐶(i) 😈(n) 🥵(a) 🤫(?) 🐰(g) 🤫(?) 🐵(r) 🥵(a) 🥳(?) → \"i n a ? g ? r a ?\". Let's see: \"in a ...gra...\". Maybe \"in a blog post a...\"? Let's think. \"i n a d g d r a k\" → \"inadgdrak\"? Not helpful. Let's think of \"in a single ...\". \"single\" is 6 letters: s i n g l e. But here the structure is \"i n a [D] g [D] r a [K]\". So \"i n a D g D r a K\". Maybe \"in a drag...\". \"in a drag race a...\"? Not sure. Let's check the 🤫 emoji. If the word has two 🤫 emojis, perhaps they are the same letter. So the thirteenth word's structure is i n a D g D r a K. So D is the same letter. Let's say D is 'l', then \"in a l g l r a k\" → \"inalglrak\"? No. Maybe D is 's' → \"in a s g s r a k\" → \"inasgsrak\"? Hmm.\n\nFourteenth word: 🥺(?) 🐶(i) 🤧(?) 🥵(a) 👻(s) → \"? i ? a s\". Maybe \"this\" → but \"this\" is 4 letters. \"?i?as\" → 5 letters. Maybe \"risis\"? No. Let's think of 🥺. The eighth word was 🥺🤑(e)😴(?)🤑(e)🥵(a)👽(t)🤑(e)🥺(?) → \"T e U e a t e T\". If T is the same letter (since it's the same emoji 🥺), then T could be 'l' → \"l e U e a t e l\". \"leUeatel\". Maybe \"leveeatel\"? No. Alternatively, T could be 'd' → \"d e U e a t e d\". \"deUeated\". Maybe \"delighted\"? Let's check: \"delighted\" is 9 letters. The eighth word is 8 letters. \"deUeated\" → 8 letters. If U is 'l', then \"delighted\" (9 letters) no. \"deveated\"? Not a word. Alternatively, \"detested\" → d e t e s t e d. But the structure is d e U e a t e d. \"detested\" would be d e t e s t e d, which has 't' as U, but 👽 is t. So U (😴) can't be t. Maybe \"denoted\" → d e n o t e d. But that's 7 letters. The eighth word is 8 letters. \"denoteed\"? No.\n\nLet's go back to the fourth word: \"american\" (a m e r i c a n). So:\n\n- 🧐=m (since 🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈 → a m e r i c a n)\n- 🐶=i (position 5)\n- 🐸=c (position 6)\n- 😈=n (position 8)\n\nLet's confirm these in other parts. The sixth word: 🐱😈 → o n (if 🐱=o). Then \"on\" is correct. The tenth word: 👽🐱 → t o → \"to\", which makes sense.\n\nThe eleventh word: 🦁🤑🐸🐱🧐🤑 → b e c o m e → \"become\" (b e c o m e). That fits perfectly! So:\n\n- 🦁=b (correct from feedback)\n- 🤑=e (correct)\n- 🐸=c (so 🐸=c, which was previously guessed as o (wrong), now c)\n- 🐱=o (previously guessed as u (wrong), now o)\n- 🧐=m (previously guessed as n (wrong), now m)\n- 🤑=e (correct)\n\nYes! \"become\" is a 6-letter word, and that substitution works. Let's check the fourth word again with these:\n\nFourth word: 🥵(a) 🧐(m) 🤑(e) 🐵(r) 🐶(i) 🐸(c) 🥵(a) 😈(n) → a m e r i c a n → \"american\". Perfect! That's a valid word.\n\nNow, the fifth word: 🦁(b) 🥵(a) 👻(?) 🦊(h) → \"ba?h\". If \"bash\" (b a s h), then 👻=s. Let's check. \"bash\" is a valid word, so 👻=s.\n\nThe sixth word: 🐱(o) 😈(n) → \"on\" (correct).\n\nThe seventh word: 🥶🤫🥳🤓 → let's see. The sentence continues with \"20, 2008, 🧐(m) 🐸(c) 🐸(c) 🐱(o) 🐱(o) 🥳(?)\". So that part is \"m c c o o [🥳]\". Let's think of \"mccook\" (a city in Nebraska). So \"m c c o o k\" → 🥳=k. So the part after 2008 would be \"Mccook\". So \"20, 2008, Mccook\". That makes sense as a date and location. So 🥳=k.\n\nThen the seventh word is 🥶🤫🥳(k) 🤓(?). Let's say the seventh word is \"June\" (J U N E). But \"June\" is 4 letters. If 🥶=j, 🤫=u, 🥳=n, but we already have 🥳=k. So that's conflicting. Alternatively, \"July\" (J U L Y) → no. Maybe \"Mark\" → M A R K. But 🦁 is b, so not m. Alternatively, \"Luke\" → L U K E. If 🥶=l, 🤫=u, 🥳=k, 🤓=e. Then \"Luke 20, 2008, Mccook\". That could be a name. Let's check:\n\nSeventh word: 🥶(l) 🤫(u) 🥳(k) 🤓(e) → \"luke\". That works. So \"Luke 20, 2008, Mccook\". That's plausible. So:\n\n- 🥶=l\n- 🤫=u\n- 🥳=k\n- 🤓=e? Wait, but 🤑 is already e. Oh, emojis must be unique. So 🤓 can't be e. Let's correct that. \"Luke\" is L U K E. But e is already taken by 🤑. So \"Luke\" can't be. Let's think of another 4-letter word. \"John\" → J O H N. But o is 🐱, h is 🦊. \"John\" → J O H N. So 🥶=j, 🤫=o (but o is 🐱), no. \"Paul\" → P A U L. a is 🥵, u could be a new emoji. \"Paul\" → P A U L. So:\n\n- 🥶=p\n- 🤫=a (but a is 🥵), no. \"Evan\" → E V A N. E is 🤑, a is 🥵. No. \"Anna\" → A N N A. a is 🥵, n is 😈. No. \"Josh\" → J O S H. O is 🐱, s could be 👻. \"Josh\" → J O S H. So:\n\n- 🥶=j\n- 🤫=o (🐱=o)\n- 🥳=s (👻=s)\n- 🤓=h (🦊=h). But h is already 🦊, so no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the seventh word is a different part. Let's look at the ninth word: 😈(n) 🥵(a) 👽(t) 🥵(a) 🥳(k) 🤓(?) 🥵(a) → \"n a t a k ? a\". \"n a t a k a\" → \"Nataka\" (a name). So if 🤓=a, but a is 🥵. No. \"n a t a k i\" → \"Nataka i\"? Maybe. Let's not get stuck here and focus on the substitutions we have so far.\n\nLet's list all the emojis and their possible letters based on the above:\n\n- 🥵=a (correct)\n- 👽=t (correct)\n- 🦊=h (correct)\n- 🤑=e (correct)\n- 🐰=g (correct)\n- 🐵=r (correct)\n- 🦁=b (correct)\n- 👻=s (guessed, since \"ba?h\" → bash)\n- 🐸=c (from \"american\" → c)\n- 🐱=o (from \"become\" → o)\n- 🧐=m (from \"american\" → m)\n- 😈=n (from \"american\" → n)\n- 🐶=i (from \"american\" → i)\n- 🥶=? (unknown)\n- 🤫=? (unknown)\n- 🥳=k (from \"mccook\" → k)\n- 🤓=? (unknown)\n- 😴=? (unknown)\n- 🥺=? (unknown)\n- 🤧=? (unknown)\n- 😇=? (unknown)\n\nNow, let's check the eighth word again: 🥺🤑😴🤑🥵👽🤑🥺 → T e U e a t e T. If T is 'd', then \"d e U e a t e d\". Let's say U is 'l', so \"delighted\" → but that's 9 letters. The eighth word has 8 emojis → 8 letters. \"deUeated\" → 8 letters. If U is 's', \"des e a t e d\" → \"deseated\" (d e s e a t e d). That's 8 letters! \"deseated\" → d e s e a t e d. Let's check:\n\n- 🥺=d (since T is the same emoji, so 🥺=d)\n- 😴=s (U=s)\n\nSo the eighth word would be \"deseated\" → d e s e a t e d. Perfect! Let's confirm:\n\n- 🥺=d\n- 😴=s\n\nThen the eighth word: 🥺(d) 🤑(e) 😴(s) 🤑(e) 🥵(a) 👽(t) 🤑(e) 🥺(d) → d e s e a t e d → \"deseated\". That's correct!\n\nNow, the fourteenth word: 🥺(d) 🐶(i) 🤧(?) 🥵(a) 👻(s) → \"d i ? a s\". Let's think of \"diary\" → d i a r y. But a is already there. \"d i s a s\" → \"disas\"? No. \"d i n a s\" → \"dinas\" (a type of rock). So if 🤧=n, then \"dinas\". But 😈 is n, so no. Alternatively, \"d i g a s\" → \"digas\"? Not a word. Maybe \"d i k a s\" → \"dikas\"? Not sure. Let's move on.\n\nThe fifteenth word: 🐸(c) 🦊(h) 🥵(a) 🧐(m) 😇(?) 🐶(i) 🐱(o) 😈(n) → \"c h a m ? i o n\". \"cham?ion\" → \"champion\" (c h a m p i o n). Oh! That fits. \"champion\" is 8 letters. So:\n\n- 😇=p\n\nSo the fifteenth word: c h a m p i o n → \"champion\". Perfect! So 😇=p.\n\nPutting it all together, let's list the emojis and their letters:\n\n- 🥵=a (correct)\n- 👽=t (correct)\n- 🦊=h (correct)\n- 🤑=e (correct)\n- 🐰=g (correct)\n- 🐵=r (correct)\n- 🦁=b (correct)\n- 👻=s (from \"bash\")\n- 🐸=c (from \"american\")\n- 🐱=o (from \"become\")\n- 🧐=m (from \"american\")\n- 😈=n (from \"american\")\n- 🐶=i (from \"american\")\n- 🥶=? (unknown)\n- 🤫=? (unknown)\n- 🥳=k (from \"mccook\")\n- 🤓=? (unknown)\n- 😴=s (from \"deseated\" → but 👻 is s. Oh no, conflict! Because 😴 was guessed as s, but 👻 is also s. Emojis must have unique letters, so that's a mistake. Let's correct that.\n\nAh, right, each emoji must correspond to a unique letter. So in the eighth word, if 🥺=d, then the structure is d e U e a t e d. Let's find another U (😴) that's unique. Let's try U=v. So \"deveated\"? No. U=c? \"deceated\"? No. U=f → \"defeated\" (d e f e a t e d). Oh! \"defeated\" is 8 letters. That's a valid word. So:\n\n- 😴=f (so U=f)\n- Then the eighth word: d e f e a t e d → \"defeated\"\n\nYes! \"defeated\" is a valid word. So:\n\n- 🥺=d\n- 😴=f\n\nThat works. No conflict because f is a new letter.\n\nNow, the fourteenth word: 🥺(d) 🐶(i) 🤧(?) 🥵(a) 👻(s) → \"d i ? a s\". \"di?as\". Maybe \"dias\" (a name), but that's 4 letters. \"d i m a s\" → \"dimas\" (a name). So if 🤧=m, but 🧐 is m. No. \"d i l a s\" → \"dilas\"? Not a word. Let's not focus on that now.\n\nThe fifth word: 🦁(b) 🥵(a) 👻(?) 🦊(h) → \"ba?h\". If \"barnh\" is not a word, maybe \"barkh\"? No. Let's think again. The fifth word is after \"american\" (fourth word), so maybe \"american [fifth word]\". \"american bash\" → \"american bash\". That could make sense. So 👻=s is still possible (bash).\n\nThe ninth word: 😈(n) 🥵(a) 👽(t) 🥵(a) 🥳(k) 🤓(?) 🥵(a) → \"n a t a k ? a\". \"n a t a k a\" → \"Nataka\" (a name). So if 🤓=a, but a is 🥵. No. \"n a t a k i\" → \"Nataka i\". Maybe.\n\nThe seventh word: 🥶🤫🥳(k) 🤓(?) → \"??k?\". Let's say it's \"book\" → b o o k. But b is 🦁, o is 🐱. \"book\" → b o o k. So:\n\n- 🥶=b (but 🦁 is b, conflict)\nNo. \"look\" → l o o k. So:\n\n- 🥶=l\n- 🤫=o (but 🐱 is o)\nConflict. \"sock\" → s o c k. s is 👻, o is 🐱, c is 🐸. \"sock\" → s o c k. So:\n\n- 🥶=s (👻 is s)\nConflict. \"tusk\" → t u s k. t is 👽, u is unknown, s is 👻, k is 🥳. \"tusk\" → t u s k. So:\n\n- 🥶=t (👽 is t)\nConflict. \"duck\" → d u c k. d is 🥺, u is unknown, c is 🐸, k is 🥳. \"duck\" → d u c k. So:\n\n- 🥶=d (🥺 is d)\nConflict. \"luck\" → l u c k. l is unknown, u is unknown, c is 🐸, k is 🥳. \"luck\" → l u c k. So:\n\n- 🥶=l\n- 🤫=u\nThat's possible. Let's say:\n\n- 🥶=l\n- 🤫=u\nThen the seventh word: l u c k → \"luck\". So \"luck 20, 2008, m c c o o k\" → \"Luck 20, 2008, Mccook\". That could work. So:\n\n- 🥶=l\n- 🤫=u\n- 🥳=k (as before)\n- 🤓=? (the seventh word is \"luck\", so the fourth emoji 🤓 would be k? No, \"luck\" is l u c k. So 🥶=l, 🤫=u, 🐸=c (since the third emoji is 🐸), 🥳=k. Oh! The seventh word is 🥶🤫🥳🤓 → l u k ?. Wait, earlier I thought 🥳=k, so the third emoji is 🥳=k. So the seventh word is l u k ?. \"l u k e\" → \"Luke\". So:\n\n- 🤓=e. But 🤑 is e. Conflict. \"l u k r\" → \"Lukr\"? Not a word. \"l u k s\" → \"Luks\"? Maybe a name. So 🤓=s (👻 is s). Conflict.\n\nLet's summarize the correct and guessed emojis we have so far, ensuring uniqueness:\n\nCorrect from feedback (attempt 1):\n- 🥵=a\n- 👽=t\n- 🦊=h\n- 🤑=e\n- 🐰=g\n- 🐵=r\n- 🦁=b\n\nGuessed and need to verify (based on word patterns):\n- 🐶=i (from \"american\": a m e r i c a n)\n- 🐸=c (from \"american\": ...i c ...)\n- 🧐=m (from \"american\": a m ...)\n- 😈=n (from \"american\": ...a n)\n- 🐱=o (from \"become\": b e c o m e)\n- 👻=s (from \"bash\": b a s h)\n- 🥺=d (from \"defeated\": d e f e a t e d)\n- 😴=f (from \"defeated\": ...f ...)\n- 🥳=k (from \"Mccook\": m c c o o k)\n- 🤫=u (from possible \"Luke\" or other words)\n- 🥶=l (from \"Luke\")\n- 🤓=? (maybe 'p' or another letter, but let's not guess if not needed)\n- 🤧=? (unknown)\n- 😇=p (from \"champion\": c h a m p i o n)\n\nLet's check the fifteenth word again with 😇=p: 🐸(c) 🦊(h) 🥵(a) 🧐(m) 😇(p) 🐶(i) 🐱(o) 😈(n) → c h a m p i o n → \"champion\". Perfect! That works. So 😇=p.\n\nNow, compiling all the emojis with their letters, including the correct ones from feedback and the new guesses:\n\n- 🥵=a (correct)\n- 👽=t (correct)\n- 🦊=h (correct)\n- 🤑=e (correct)\n- 🐰=g (correct)\n- 🐵=r (correct)\n- 🦁=b (correct)\n- 👻=s (guessed)\n- 🐸=c (guessed)\n- 🐱=o (guessed)\n- 🧐=m (guessed)\n- 😈=n (guessed)\n- 🐶=i (guessed)\n- 🥺=d (guessed)\n- 😴=f (guessed)\n- 🥳=k (guessed)\n- 🤫=u (guessed)\n- 🥶=l (guessed)\n- 😇=p (guessed)\n- 🤓=? (unknown, but perhaps not needed for this guess)\n- 🤧=? (unknown)\n\nThe question requires us to submit guesses, including the hint (🥵=a) and previously correctly answered emojis (👽=t, 🦊=h, 🤑=e, 🐰=g, 🐵=r, 🦁=b), plus the new guesses. The first attempt's feedback said 👻, 🐸, 🐱, 🧐, 😈 were incorrect, so we need to correct those.\n\nSo the answer should include all the correct ones from history and the new guesses. Let's list them:\n\n- 🥵=a (correct)\n- 👽=t (correct)\n- 🦊=h (correct)\n- 🤑=e (correct)\n- 🐰=g (correct)\n- 🐵=r (correct)\n- 🦁=b (correct)\n- 👻=s (new guess)\n- 🐸=c (new guess)\n- 🐱=o (new guess)\n- 🧐=m (new guess)\n- 😈=n (new guess)\n- 🐶=i (new guess)\n- 🥺=d (new guess)\n- 😴=f (new guess)\n- 🥳=k (new guess)\n- 🤫=u (new guess)\n- 🥶=l (new guess)\n- 😇=p (new guess)\n\nBut perhaps some of these are not necessary. The problem says to submit guesses for this round, including the hint and previously correct ones. The user's first guess included 12 emojis, and feedback showed which were correct. Now, in the second attempt, we need to include all correct ones (from feedback) and our new guesses for the incorrect ones.\n\nThe first attempt's incorrect emojis were 👻, 🐸, 🐱, 🧐, 😈. So we need to provide new guesses for these. Also, the first attempt didn't guess 🐶, 🥺, 😴, 🥳, 🤫, 🥶, 🤓, 🤧, 😇, so we can guess those as well if we have ideas.\n\nBut the problem states: \"submit your guesses for this round in the format 'emoji=word', separated by commas. Note that the emoji provided as a hint, as well as previously correctly answered emojis, must also be included in your answer.\"\n\nSo we must include the hint (🥵=a) and all previously correctly answered emojis (👽=t, 🦊=h, 🤑=e, 🐰=g, 🐵=r, 🦁=b), plus our new guesses for the others.\n\nSo the answer should include:\n\n- 🥵=a\n- 👽=t\n- 🦊=h\n- 🤑=e\n- 🐰=g\n- 🐵=r\n- 🦁=b\n- 👻=s (new guess)\n- 🐸=c (new guess)\n- 🐱=o (new guess)\n- 🧐=m (new guess)\n- 😈=n (new guess)\n- 🐶=i (new guess)\n- 🥺=d (new guess)\n- 😴=f (new guess)\n- 🥳=k (new guess)\n- 🤫=u (new guess)\n- 🥶=l (new guess)\n- 😇=p (new guess)\n- 🤓=? (maybe we can leave it out if unsure, but perhaps guess q or another letter. But since we have \"Luke 20, 2008, Mccook\", if the seventh word is \"Luke\", then 🤓=e, but e is taken. Alternatively, if it's \"Luka\", then 🤓=a (taken). Maybe 🤓=y. Let's guess 🤓=y for now.)\n- 🤧=? (maybe 'w' as a guess)\n\nBut perhaps to keep it concise, focus on the ones we're confident about. Let's list the most confident ones:\n\n- 🥵=a\n- 👽=t\n- 🦊=h\n- 🤑=e\n- 🐰=g\n- 🐵=r\n- 🦁=b\n- 👻=s\n- 🐸=c\n- 🐱=o\n- 🧐=m\n- 😈=n\n- 🐶=i\n- 🥺=d\n- 😴=f\n- 🥳=k\n- 🤫=u\n- 🥶=l\n- 😇=p\n\nThese are the ones that fit into the words we've decoded (american, become, champion, defeated, etc.). The others (🤓, 🤧) can be left out or guessed, but perhaps the problem expects us to guess as many as possible based on the patterns.\n\nTo solve this Crypto Word Game, we analyze the encoded sentence using the provided hint and feedback from the first attempt. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Known Correct Emojis (from Feedback):\n- 🥵=a (hint, confirmed)\n- 👽=t (confirmed)\n- 🦊=h (confirmed)\n- 🤑=e (confirmed)\n- 🐰=g (confirmed)\n- 🐵=r (confirmed)\n- 🦁=b (confirmed)\n\n### Guesses for Incorrect\/Unanswered Emojis:\n1. **Fourth Word**: 🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈 → \"american\" (a m e r i c a n). This implies:\n   - 🧐=m (2nd emoji: \"m\" in \"american\")\n   - 🐶=i (5th emoji: \"i\" in \"american\")\n   - 🐸=c (6th emoji: \"c\" in \"american\")\n   - 😈=n (8th emoji: \"n\" in \"american\")\n\n2. **Eleventh Word**: 🦁🤑🐸🐱🧐🤑 → \"become\" (b e c o m e). This implies:\n   - 🐱=o (4th emoji: \"o\" in \"become\")\n\n3. **Fifth Word**: 🦁🥵👻🦊 → \"bash\" (b a s h). This implies:\n   - 👻=s (3rd emoji: \"s\" in \"bash\")\n\n4. **Eighth Word**: 🥺🤑😴🤑🥵👽🤑🥺 → \"defeated\" (d e f e a t e d). This implies:\n   - 🥺=d (1st\/8th emoji: \"d\" in \"defeated\")\n   - 😴=f (3rd emoji: \"f\" in \"defeated\")\n\n5. **Seventh Word & \"20, 2008\" Context**: 🥶🤫🥳🤓 → \"luck\" (l u k ?) and \"20, 2008, 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳\" → \"Mccook\" (m c c o o k). This implies:\n   - 🥶=l (1st emoji: \"l\" in \"luck\")\n   - 🤫=u (2nd emoji: \"u\" in \"luck\")\n   - 🥳=k (3rd emoji: \"k\" in \"Mccook\")\n\n6. **Fifteenth Word**: 🐸🦊🥵🧐😇🐶🐱😈 → \"champion\" (c h a m p i o n). This implies:\n   - 😇=p (5th emoji: \"p\" in \"champion\")\n\n### Final Guesses:\nIncluding all confirmed and newly guessed emojis, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: 🥵=a,👽=t,🦊=h,🤑=e,🐰=g,🐵=r,🦁=b,👻=s,🐸=c,🐱=o,🧐=m,😈=n,🐶=i,🥺=d,😴=f,🥳=k,🤫=u,🥶=l,😇=p","Okay, let's try to figure out the current guess. First, let's look at the history and feedback to know which emojis are already correct. \n\nFrom the first attempt, 🥵=a (correct), 👽=t (correct), 🦊=h (correct), 🤑=e (correct), 🐰=g (correct), 🐵=r (correct), 🦁=b (correct) are all True. The others like 👻, 🐸, 🐱, 🧐, 😈 were wrong. \n\nSecond attempt feedback says: 👻=s (True), 🐸=c (True), 🐱=o (True), 🧐=m (True), 😈=n (True), 🐶=i (True), 🥺=d (True), 😴=f (True), 🤫=u (True), 😇=p (True). The ones that were False are 🥳=k (False), 🥶=l (False). \n\nSo the correct mappings we have so far are:\n🥵=a, 👽=t, 🦊=h, 🤑=e, 🐰=g, 🐵=r, 🦁=b, 👻=s, 🐸=c, 🐱=o, 🧐=m, 😈=n, 🐶=i, 🥺=d, 😴=f, 🤫=u, 😇=p.\n\nNow, the only ones left to figure out are 🥳 and 🥶. Let's look at the encoded sentence and try to substitute the known emojis to see where these fit.\n\nLet's substitute the known ones into the encoded sentence:\n\nEncoded Sentence: 🥵👽 👽🦊🤑 🐰🐵🤑🥵👽 🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈 🦁🥵👻🦊 🐱😈 🥶🤫🥳🤓 20, 2008, 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳 🥺🤑😴🤑🥵👽🤑🥺 😈🥵👽🥵🥳🤓🥵 👽🐱 🦁🤑🐸🐱🧐🤑 👽🦊🤑 🐶😈🥵🤫🐰🤫🐵🥵🥳 🥺🐶🤧🥵👻 🐸🦊🥵🧐😇🐶🐱😈.\n\nSubstituting known:\n\na t   t h e   g r e a t   a m e r i c a n   b a s h   o n   🥶 u 🥳 🤓 20, 2008, m c c o o 🥳   d e f e a t e d   n a t a 🥳 🤓 a   t o   b e c o m e   t h e   i n a u g r a 🥳   d i 🤧 a s   c h a m p i o n.\n\nWait, let's break it down step by step. Let's process each part:\n\n1. 🥵👽 = a t → \"at\"\n2. 👽🦊🤑 = t h e → \"the\"\n3. 🐰🐵🤑🥵👽 = g r e a t → \"great\"\n4. 🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈 = a m e r i c a n → \"american\" (since a m e r i c a n, yes that makes sense. So 🐸=c (correct), 😈=n (correct) here. So \"american\" checks out.\n5. 🦁🥵👻🦊 = b a s h → \"bash\" (since 👻=s, so b a s h. That works.)\n6. 🐱😈 = o n → \"on\" (correct, 🐱=o, 😈=n → \"on\")\n7. 🥶🤫🥳🤓 = 🥶 u 🥳 🤓 → Let's keep that for later.\n8. 20, 2008, → numbers, maybe dates.\n9. 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳 = m c c o o 🥳 → \"mccoo\" + 🥳. Maybe \"mccook\"? \"mccoo\" could be part of a name. If \"mccook\", then 🥳=k. But in attempt 2, the guess was 🥳=k and feedback said False. So that's not it. Let's check other parts.\n10. 🥺🤑😴🤑🥵👽🤑🥺 = d e f e a t e d → \"defeated\" (d e f e a t e d, correct. 🥺=d, 🤑=e, 😴=f, 🥵=a, 👽=t. So \"defeated\" is correct.\n11. 😈🥵👽🥵🥳🤓🥵 = n a t a 🥳 🤓 a → \"nata\" + 🥳 🤓 a. Maybe \"national\" if 🥳=i and 🤓=o, but not sure. Let's check another part.\n12. 👽🐱 = t o → \"to\" (correct, 👽=t, 🐱=o)\n13. 🦁🤑🐸🐱🧐🤑 = b e c o m e → \"become\" (b e c o m e. Correct, 🦁=b, 🤑=e, 🐸=c, 🐱=o, 🧐=m. So \"become\" works. That's a good check.\n14. 👽🦊🤑 = t h e → \"the\" (correct)\n15. 🐶😈🥵🤫🐰🤫🐵🥵🥳 = i n a u g u r a 🥳 → \"inaugura\" + 🥳. \"inaugural\" would be i n a u g u r a l, but 👽=t, so \"inaugura\" + maybe \"l\"? But 👽 is t. Wait, \"inaugural\" ends with l, but here the last emoji is 🥳. So \"inaugura\" + 🥳. Let's see, \"inaugural\" is 9 letters. Let's count the emojis here: 🐶😈🥵🤫🐰🤫🐵🥵🥳 → 8 emojis. So 8 letters. i (🐶) n (😈) a (🥵) u (🤫) g (🐰) u (🤫) r (🐵) a (🥵) 🥳. So that's i n a u g u r a 🥳. 8 letters. \"inaugura\" is 8 letters? i-n-a-u-g-u-r-a → 8 letters. So \"inaugura\" + 🥳. What could that be? Maybe \"inaugurate\"? No, that's longer. Alternatively, \"inaugural\" would be 9 letters. Maybe \"inaugura\" is part of \"inaugural address\" or something. Let's check the next part.\n16. 🥺🐶🤧🥵👻 = d i 🤧 a s → \"di\" + 🤧 + \"as\". Maybe \"dishas\"? Not sure. Maybe \"dismiss\" but missing letters. 🤧 is a new emoji not in the history, so we can ignore it for now.\n17. 🐸🦊🥵🧐😇🐶🐱😈 = c h a m p i o n → \"champion\" (c h a m p i o n). Let's check: 🐸=c, 🦊=h, 🥵=a, 🧐=m, 😇=p, 🐶=i, 🐱=o, 😈=n. So c h a m p i o n → \"champion\"! That's perfect. So that's correct. So that part is \"champion.\"\n\nNow, let's go back to the parts involving 🥳. Let's look at the 9th part again: 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳 = m c c o o 🥳. \"mccoo\" + 🥳. \"mccook\" is a possible name, but in attempt 2, 🥳 was guessed as k and feedback was False. So that's out. What else? Maybe \"mccoo\" is \"McCoo\" (a surname), and the next part could be \"McCoo [something]\". Let's check the 7th part: 🥶🤫🥳🤓 = 🥶 u 🥳 🤓. Maybe a date or a word. 20, 2008, so maybe \"July\" or a month? Let's think. If the 7th part is a month: months are like \"January\", \"February\", etc. Let's see: \"July\" is 4 letters. So 🥶 u 🥳 🤓. If it's \"July\", then:\n\n🥶=j, u (🤫=u), 🥳=l, 🤓=y. So \"july\". Let's check if that makes sense. Then, the 7th part would be \"July\". Let's check 20, 2008, → \"20, 2008\" could be \"20 July 2008\". Then, the 9th part: 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳 = m c c o o l (if 🥳=l). \"McCool\"? Maybe. Let's check 11th part: 😈🥵👽🥵🥳🤓🥵 = n a t a l y a → \"natalya\"? Maybe a name. 15th part: 🐶😈🥵🤫🐰🤫🐵🥵🥳 = i n a u g u r a l → \"inaugural\" (since i n a u g u r a l). Oh! \"inaugural\" is 9 letters. Let's count the emojis here: 🐶😈🥵🤫🐰🤫🐵🥵🥳 → 8 emojis. Wait, \"inaugural\" is i-n-a-u-g-u-r-a-l → 9 letters, which would be 9 emojis. But here there are 8 emojis. Let's recount:\n\n🐶=i, 😈=n, 🥵=a, 🤫=u, 🐰=g, 🤫=u, 🐵=r, 🥵=a, 🥳=l. That's 9 emojis! Oh right, I missed one. So that's 9 emojis. So i n a u g u r a l → \"inaugural\". That makes sense. So 🥳=l. Let's check that. Then, \"inaugural\" would fit. \n\nLet's check 9th part again: 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳 = m c c o o l → \"mccool\". Maybe a name like \"McCoo l\" (but maybe \"McCool\"). 7th part: 🥶🤫🥳🤓 = 🥶 u l 🤓. If \"July\" (j u l y), then 🥶=j, 🤓=y. So 7th part is \"July\". Then 20, 2008 would be \"20 July 2008\". That makes sense as a date. \n\nLet's check 11th part: 😈🥵👽🥵🥳🤓🥵 = n a t a l y a → \"natalya\". That could be a name. \n\nNow, 7th part: 🥶🤫🥳🤓 = j u l y → \"July\". So 🥶=j, 🤓=y. \n\nLet's check the 9th part: 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳 = m c c o o l → \"mccool\". That works if 🥳=l. \n\nThe 15th part: i n a u g u r a l → \"inaugural\" (correct with 🥳=l). \n\nWhat about the 11th part: n a t a l y a → \"natalya\". That's a possible name. \n\nSo 🥳=l and 🥶=j, 🤓=y. Let's check if that fits. \n\nIn attempt 2, 🥶 was guessed as l (False), which is correct because we're now thinking 🥶=j. 🥳 was guessed as k (False), so now l is a new guess. \n\nLet's check if there's any other clues. The 17th part was \"champion\" which fits. The 13th part is \"become\" which fits. \n\nSo the remaining emojis to guess are 🥳, 🥶, and 🤓. From the 7th part, if \"July\" is the month, then 🥶=j, 🤫=u (correct), 🥳=l, 🤓=y. That seems to fit. \n\nSo the current guess should include all correct emojis from history plus the new ones. Let's list all the correct mappings from the history feedback:\n\nFrom attempt 1 and 2 feedback:\n🥵=a (True)\n👽=t (True)\n🦊=h (True)\n🤑=e (True)\n🐰=g (True)\n🐵=r (True)\n🦁=b (True)\n👻=s (True)\n🐸=c (True)\n🐱=o (True)\n🧐=m (True)\n😈=n (True)\n🐶=i (True)\n🥺=d (True)\n😴=f (True)\n🤫=u (True)\n😇=p (True)\n🥳=l (guessed now)\n🥶=j (guessed now)\n🤓=y (guessed now)\n\nWait, but the user's answer must include all the correct ones from history (since the note says: \"the emoji provided as a hint, as well as previously correctly answered emojis, must also be included in your answer\"). So all the True ones from history must be in the answer. \n\nThe history's feedback for attempt 2: 🥵,👽,🦊,🤑,🐰,🐵,🦁,👻,🐸,🐱,🧐,😈,🐶,🥺,😴,🤫,😇 are all True. So these must be included. Then, the new guesses are for 🥳, 🥶, 🤓. \n\nSo putting it all together, the answer should list all the correct ones plus the new guesses. \n\nSo the answer would be:\n\n🥵=a,👽=t,🦊=h,🤑=e,🐰=g,🐵=r,🦁=b,👻=s,🐸=c,🐱=o,🧐=m,😈=n,🐶=i,🥺=d,😴=f,🤫=u,😇=p,🥳=l,🥶=j,🤓=y\n\n\nTo solve this Crypto Word Game, we analyze the encoded sentence, feedback from previous attempts, and the provided hint to deduce the correct emoji-to-letter mappings. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Known Correct Mappings (from History Feedback):\n- From Attempt 1 Feedback: 🥵=a (True), 👽=t (True), 🦊=h (True), 🤑=e (True), 🐰=g (True), 🐵=r (True), 🦁=b (True).\n- From Attempt 2 Feedback: 👻=s (True), 🐸=c (True), 🐱=o (True), 🧐=m (True), 😈=n (True), 🐶=i (True), 🥺=d (True), 😴=f (True), 🤫=u (True), 😇=p (True).\n\n### Deducing Remaining Mappings:\nThe only emojis not yet confirmed are 🥳, 🥶, and 🤓. We use the encoded sentence and context to infer these:\n\n1. **🥳**:  \n   - The phrase `🐶😈🥵🤫🐰🤫🐵🥵🥳` translates to `i n a u g u r a 🥳` (using known mappings). This matches \"inaugural\" (i-n-a-u-g-u-r-a-l), so 🥳=l.\n\n2. **🥶 and 🤓**:  \n   - The phrase `🥶🤫🥳🤓` appears alongside \"20, 2008\". Assuming this is a date (e.g., \"July 20, 2008\"), `🥶🤫🥳🤓` would be \"July\". With 🤫=u and 🥳=l, this gives 🥶=j and 🤓=y.\n\n### Final Mappings:\nAll known correct mappings (from history) are included, along with the deduced mappings for 🥳, 🥶, and 🤓.\n\nAnswer: 🥵=a,👽=t,🦊=h,🤑=e,🐰=g,🐵=r,🦁=b,👻=s,🐸=c,🐱=o,🧐=m,😈=n,🐶=i,🥺=d,😴=f,🤫=u,😇=p,🥳=l,🥶=j,🤓=y","Okay, let's try to figure out the current guess. The user has given the history of previous attempts and their feedback. Let's start by listing out all the emojis and their confirmed correct mappings based on the feedback.\n\nFrom Attempt 1 feedback: 🥵=a (correct), 👽=t (correct), 🦊=h (correct), 🤑=e (correct), 🐰=g (correct), 🐵=r (correct), 🦁=b (correct). The others were wrong then, but maybe corrected in later attempts.\n\nAttempt 2 feedback: 👻=s (correct), 🐸=c (correct), 🐱=o (correct), 🧐=m (correct), 😈=n (correct), 🐶=i (correct), 🥺=d (correct), 😴=f (correct), 🤫=u (correct), 😇=p (correct). But 🥳=k was wrong, 🥶=l was wrong.\n\nAttempt 3 feedback: 🥳=l (correct), 🥶=j (correct), 🤓=y (correct). All others in that guess were correct based on the feedback (since all entries in the feedback are True).\n\nLet me list all confirmed mappings now:\n\n🥵=a\n\n👽=t\n\n🦊=h\n\n🤑=e\n\n🐰=g\n\n🐵=r\n\n🦁=b\n\n👻=s\n\n🐸=c\n\n🐱=o\n\n🧐=m\n\n😈=n\n\n🐶=i\n\n🥺=d\n\n😴=f\n\n🤫=u\n\n😇=p\n\n🥳=l\n\n🥶=j\n\n🤓=y\n\nLet me check if there are any emojis not covered yet. Let's look at the encoded sentence and list all emojis:\n\n🥵👽 👽🦊🤑 🐰🐵🤑🥵👽 🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈 🦁🥵👻🦊 🐱😈 🥶🤫🥳🤓 20, 2008, 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳 🥺🤑😴🤑🥵👽🤑🥺 😈🥵👽🥵🥳🤓🥵 👽🐱 🦁🤑🐸🐱🧐🤑 👽🦊🤑 🐶😈🥵🤫🐰🤫🐵🥵🥳 🥺🐶🤧🥵👻 🐸🦊🥵🧐😇🐶🐱😈.\n\nEmojis present:\n\n🥵, 👽, 🦊, 🤑, 🐰, 🐵, 🦁, 👻, 🐸, 🐱, 🧐, 😈, 🐶, 🥺, 😴, 🤫, 😇, 🥳, 🥶, 🤓, and... wait, is there any missing? Let's check:\n\nLooking at the sentence:\n\n- 🥵👽: a t\n- 👽🦊🤑: t h e\n- 🐰🐵🤑🥵👽: g r e a t\n- 🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈: a m e r i c a n\n- 🦁🥵👻🦊: b a s h\n- 🐱😈: o n\n- 🥶🤫🥳🤓: j u l y\n- 20, 2008, 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳: m c c o o l\n- 🥺🤑😴🤑🥵👽🤑🥺: d e f e a t e d\n- 😈🥵👽🥵🥳🤓🥵: n a t a l y a\n- 👽🐱: t o\n- 🦁🤑🐸🐱🧐🤑: b e c o m e\n- 👽🦊🤑: t h e\n- 🐶😈🥵🤫🐰🤫🐵🥵🥳: i n a u g u r a l\n- 🥺🐶🤧🥵👻: d i ? a s (Wait, there's a new emoji here: 🤧)\n- 🐸🦊🥵🧐😇🐶🐱😈: c h a m p i o n\n\nAh, I see a new emoji: 🤧. It's in the part \"🥺🐶🤧🥵👻\" which would be \"d i [🤧] a s\".\n\nSo the only emoji not yet mapped is 🤧. Let's check the history. The previous attempts didn't include 🤧, so we need to guess its letter.\n\nLet's reconstruct the sentence with the known mappings to find the missing word.\n\nBreaking down the encoded sentence with known emojis:\n\n1. 🥵👽 → a t\n2. 👽🦊🤑 → t h e\n3. 🐰🐵🤑🥵👽 → g r e a t\n4. 🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈 → a m e r i c a n\n5. 🦁🥵👻🦊 → b a s h\n6. 🐱😈 → o n\n7. 🥶🤫🥳🤓 → j u l y (since 🥶=j, 🤫=u, 🥳=l, 🤓=y → j u l y)\n8. 20, 2008, 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳 → 20, 2008, m c c o o l (🧐=m, 🐸=c, 🐱=o, 🥳=l → m c c o o l)\n9. 🥺🤑😴🤑🥵👽🤑🥺 → d e f e a t e d (🥺=d, 🤑=e, 😴=f, 🥵=a, 👽=t → d e f e a t e d)\n10. 😈🥵👽🥵🥳🤓🥵 → n a t a l y a (😈=n, 🥵=a, 👽=t, 🥳=l, 🤓=y → n a t a l y a)\n11. 👽🐱 → t o\n12. 🦁🤑🐸🐱🧐🤑 → b e c o m e (🦁=b, 🤑=e, 🐸=c, 🐱=o, 🧐=m → b e c o m e)\n13. 👽🦊🤑 → t h e\n14. 🐶😈🥵🤫🐰🤫🐵🥵🥳 → i n a u g u r a l (🐶=i, 😈=n, 🥵=a, 🤫=u, 🐰=g, 🐵=r, 🥳=l → i n a u g u r a l)\n15. 🥺🐶🤧🥵👻 → d i [?] a s (🥺=d, 🐶=i, 🥵=a, 👻=s → d i [?] a s)\n16. 🐸🦊🥵🧐😇🐶🐱😈 → c h a m p i o n (🐸=c, 🦊=h, 🥵=a, 🧐=m, 😇=p, 🐶=i, 🐱=o, 😈=n → c h a m p i o n)\n\nSo part 15 is \"d i [?] a s\". Let's think of a 5-letter word here: d i _ a s. Possible words? Maybe \"d i s a s\" (no), \"d i m a s\" (possible), \"d i t a s\" (unlikely), \"d i r a s\" (no), \"d i v a s\" (yes, divas! But \"divas\" is d i v a s. So the missing emoji 🤧 would be v.\n\nSo the missing emoji 🤧 should map to v. Let's check if that makes sense. \"d i v a s\" is a valid word. That fits. So the only remaining emoji is 🤧=v.\n\nSo the answer should include all the previously correct emojis (as per the note that the hint and previously correct must be included) plus the new one. Let's list all confirmed:\n\n🥵=a, 👽=t, 🦊=h, 🤑=e, 🐰=g, 🐵=r, 🦁=b, 👻=s, 🐸=c, 🐱=o, 🧐=m, 😈=n, 🐶=i, 🥺=d, 😴=f, 🤫=u, 😇=p, 🥳=l, 🥶=j, 🤓=y, 🤧=v.\n\nLet me confirm all parts again with this:\n\nPart 15: 🥺🐶🤧🥵👻 → d i v a s → correct. That works.\n\n🥵=a,👽=t,🦊=h,🤑=e,🐰=g,🐵=r,🦁=b,👻=s,🐸=c,🐱=o,🧐=m,😈=n,🐶=i,🥺=d,😴=f,🤫=u,😇=p,🥳=l,🥶=j,🤓=y,🤧=v\nAnswer: 🥵=a,👽=t,🦊=h,🤑=e,🐰=g,🐵=r,🦁=b,👻=s,🐸=c,🐱=o,🧐=m,😈=n,🐶=i,🥺=d,😴=f,🤫=u,😇=p,🥳=l,🥶=j,🤓=y,🤧=v"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The encoded sentence has a lot of emojis, and we know that 🤖=e. First, I need to look at the structure of the sentence. Let's break it down into words based on spaces. The encoded sentence is:\n\n1. 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦\n2. 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦\n3. 🐱🐦\n4. 😱🤮\n5. 😱🐶🐦🐸😇😱🐧🐱😱🤮\n6. 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸\n7. 🦆🐔😱🐱🤮\n8. 👽🤓🤮🤖🥵\n9. 🐷🐨\n10. 🤓🤖🐦🦉😱😇🐵🤖😇🐦\n(Parenthetical part: (🦉👽😇🐵🤖😇🐧🐨 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 🐻😇👽🐶😍 🐷🤖🦉👽😇🤖 🐱🐸🐦 😱🦆🦁🐶🐱🐦🐱🐸🐱👽🤮 👽🤮 23 🤮👽🙄🤖🐵🐷🤖😇 2007))\n\nFirst, since 🤖=e, let's replace all 🤖 with e. Let's list all the words with 🤖:\n\n1. 🦆👽🐧e🐦\n2. 🐦🐶😍e😇🐵😱😇🤠e🐸🐦\n6. 🐦🐶😍e😇🐵😱😇🤠e🐸\n8. 👽🤓🤮e🥵\n10. 🤓e🐦🦉😱😇🐵e😇🐦\nParenthetical part: (🦉👽😇🐵e😇🐧🐨 ... 🐷e🦉👽😇e ... )\n\nLooking at word 2 and 6: word 2 is \"🐦🐶😍e😇🐵😱😇🤠e🐸🐦\" and word 6 is \"🐦🐶😍e😇🐵😱😇🤠e🐸\". So word 6 is the same as the first part of word 2, missing the last 🐦. So word 2 is word 6 plus \"🐸🐦\". Let's note that.\n\nWord 8: 👽🤓🤮e🥵. If we consider that \"e\" is the 5th letter, maybe the word ends with \"e\" and has 5 letters? For example, maybe \"theme\" if 👽=t, 🤓=h, 🤮=m, e=e, 🥵=e? But that's a guess.\n\nWord 10: \"🤓e🐦🦉😱😇🐵e😇🐦\". Let's count letters: 🤓 (1), e (2), 🐦 (3), 🦉 (4), 😱 (5), 😇 (6), 🐵 (7), e (8), 😇 (9), 🐦 (10). So 10 letters. Maybe a longer word.\n\nWord 3: 🐱🐦. Two letters. Could be \"it\", \"in\", \"is\", \"at\", \"on\", etc.\n\nWord 4: 😱🤮. Two letters. Maybe \"of\", \"to\", \"by\", \"or\", \"he\", \"she\" (but she has 3 letters). Since \"e\" is already used, maybe \"of\" (😱=o, 🤮=f), or \"it\" (but word 3 is 🐱🐦, which could be \"it\"). Let's hold that.\n\nWord 5: 😱🐶🐦🐸😇😱🐧🐱😱🤮. Let's count letters: 😱 (1), 🐶 (2), 🐦 (3), 🐸 (4), 😇 (5), 😱 (6), 🐧 (7), 🐱 (8), 😱 (9), 🤮 (10). 10 letters. Maybe a sentence part like \"on the ... of\".\n\nWord 7: 🦆🐔😱🐱🤮. 5 letters. Maybe \"there\" if letters fit, but not sure.\n\nThe parenthetical part ends with \"23\" and \"2007\", which are numbers, so probably years or quantities. The part before that is \"🤮👽🙄🤖🐵🐷🤖😇 2007\". Let's replace 🤖=e: \"🤮👽🙄e🐵🐷e😇 2007\". So maybe \"in the year 2007\" if \"year\" is part of it. Let's see: \"year\" is 4 letters. The part \"🙄e🐵🐷\" would be 4 letters (🙄, e, 🐵, 🐷). If \"year\" then 🙄=y, e=e, 🐵=a, 🐷=r. Then \"e😇\" would be \"er\" (if 😇=r, but then 🐵=a and 😇=r. Let's check: \"🤮👽🙄e🐵🐷e😇\" would be \"🤮👽y e a r e r\". Maybe \"in the year\" where \"in\" is 😱🤮 (if 😱=i, 🤮=n), but word 4 is 😱🤮 which would be \"in\". Let's try that. So 😱=i, 🤮=n.\n\nIf 😱=i, then word 4 is \"in\". Let's check other words. Word 5: i 🐶 🐦 🐸 😇 i 🐧 🐱 i n. So \"i _ _ _ _ i _ _ i n\". Maybe \"in the middle of\" but 10 letters. Let's see: 10 letters: \"i (2) (3) (4) (5) i (7) (8) i n\".\n\nWord 2: 🐦🐶😍e😇🐵i😇🤠e🐸🐦. Let's substitute 😱=i, so 😱=i. So word 2 is \"🐦 🐶 😍 e 😇 🐵 i 😇 🤠 e 🐸 🐦\". Let's count letters: 12 letters. If \"the\" is a common word, maybe 🐦=t (since \"t\" is common). Let's assume 🐦=t. Then word 2 starts with t, word 3 is 🐱t (since 🐦=t, word 3 is 🐱t, which could be \"it\" (if 🐱=i), but wait, 😱=i, so maybe 🐱=s, making word 3 \"st\"? Or \"at\" (🐱=a, 🐦=t). Let's try 🐦=t (since \"t\" is a common starting letter). Then:\n\nWord 1: 🦆👽🐧e t (since 🦆👽🐧e🐦, 🐦=t) → 5 letters: _ _ _ e t. Maybe \"planet\"? But 5 letters: \"stone\" (s t o n e? No, 5 letters: s t o n e is 5. So if 🦆=s, 👽=t, 🐧=o, then \"stone\" (s t o e t? No, 5 letters: s t o e t? That's 5 letters but \"stone\" is s t o n e. Oh, maybe 🐧=n. Then 🦆👽🐧e t would be s t n e t? Not matching. Alternatively, \"theme t\"? No. Maybe \"these t\"? \"these\" is t h e s e, but 5 letters: t h e s e. So 👽=h, 🐧=s, 🦆=t? Then 🦆=t, 👽=h, 🐧=s: t h s e t? No. Maybe \"where t\"? \"where\" is w h e r e. 5 letters: 🦆=w, 👽=h, 🐧=r: w h r e t. No.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at word 2 with 🐦=t: \"t 🐶 😍 e 😇 🐵 i 😇 🤠 e 🐸 t\". So \"t _ _ e _ _ i _ _ e _ t\". 12 letters. Common 12-letter words? Maybe \"the government...\" No. Let's check word 6, which is \"t 🐶 😍 e 😇 🐵 i 😇 🤠 e 🐸\". So 11 letters. If word 2 is 12 letters (word6 + \"🐸t\"), then word6 is 11 letters. Maybe \"the president\" (11 letters: t h e p r e s i d e n t). Let's see: t (🐦=t) h (👽=h) e (🤖=e) p (🐶=p) r (😍=r) e (🤖=e) s (😇=s) i (😱=i) d (🐵=d) e (🤖=e) n (🤠=n) t (🐸=t). Let's check:\n\nword6: t (🐦=t) 🐶=p, 😍=r, e (🤖=e), 😇=s, 🐵=d, i (😱=i), 😇=s, 🤠=n, e (🤖=e), 🐸=t → \"t p r e s d i s n e t\"? No, that's not \"president\". Let's try \"the committee\" (11 letters: t h e c o m m i t t e e). No, 11 letters: t h e c o m m i t t e e is 11? t(1), h(2), e(3), c(4), o(5), m(6), m(7), i(8), t(9), t(10), e(11). So 11 letters. Let's see:\n\nword6: t (🐦=t), 🐶=c, 😍=o, e (🤖=e), 😇=m, 🐵=m, i (😱=i), 😇=m, 🤠=t, e (🤖=e), 🐸=t → \"t c o e m m i m t e t\"? No, that's \"tcoemmi met t\" which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the hint that 🤖=e. The most frequent emoji might be 🐦, let's count the emojis:\n\nLet's list all emojis and their counts:\n\n🦆: appears in 1, 7, parenthetical (maybe 3 times)\n👽: 1, 8, parenthetical (multiple times)\n🐧: 1, 5, parenthetical (3 times)\n🤖: multiple (we know it's e)\n🐦: many times (probably t, a, o, i, n, s; common letters)\n🐶: 2, 5, 7, parenthetical (4 times)\n😍: 2, 6, parenthetical (3 times)\n😇: 2, 5, 6, 10, parenthetical (many times)\n🐵: 2, 6, 10, parenthetical (4 times)\n😱: 2, 4, 5, 10, parenthetical (many times)\n🤠: 2, 6 (2 times)\n🐸: 2, 5, 6 (3 times)\n🐱: 3, 5, 7 (3 times)\n🤮: 4, 5, 7, 8, parenthetical (many times)\n🐔: 7 (1)\n🤓: 8, 10 (2)\n🥵: 8 (1)\n🐷: 9, parenthetical (2)\n🐨: 9, parenthetical (2)\n🦉: 10, parenthetical (2)\n🐻: parenthetical (1)\n🦁: parenthetical (1)\n🙄: parenthetical (1)\n\nThe most frequent emojis are 🐦, 😇, 😱, 🤮. Since the hint is 🤖=e, the next frequent could be 🐦. Let's assume 🐦=t (most common starting letter). Let's check:\n\nEncoded sentence word 3: 🐱🐦 → if 🐦=t, then 🐱=s → \"st\"? Or 🐱=a → \"at\"? \"At\" is common. Let's try 🐦=t and 🐱=a, so word3 is \"at\".\n\nWord4: 😱🤮 → if \"in\" (common), 😱=i, 🤮=n. Then word4 is \"in\".\n\nWord5: 😱🐶🐦🐸😇😱🐧🐱😱🤮 → i 🐶 t 🐸 😇 i 🐧 a i n → \"i _ t _ _ i _ a i n\". 10 letters. Maybe \"in the family in\" but not sure. Let's see: \"i (2) t (4) (5) i (7) a i n\". Maybe \"in the final in\" → \"i n t h e f i n a l i n\"? No, but let's see:\n\nIf 😇=h (since \"the\" is common), then word5: i 🐶 t 🐸 h i 🐧 a i n. \"i _ t _ h i _ a i n\". Maybe \"in the chain in\"? \"i n t h e c h a i n\" → 10 letters: i(1), n(2), t(3), h(4), e(5), c(6), h(7), a(8), i(9), n(10). That fits! Let's check:\n\n😱=i, 🤮=n (so word4 is \"in\"), 🐦=t (word3 is \"at\"), 😇=h (so word5 part: 😇=h), 🐸=e (since \"the\" would be t(🐦) h(😇) e(🐸)), then word5: i (😱=i) 🐶 (c) t (🐦=t) e (🐸=e) h (😇=h) i (😱=i) 🐧 (h) a (🐱=a) i (😱=i) n (🤮=n). So \"i c t e h i h a i n\" → \"ict ehi hain\"? No, maybe \"in the chain in\" → \"i n t h e c h a i n\" → n=🤮, t=🐦, h=😇, e=🐸, c=🐶, h=🐧, a=🐱, i=😱, n=🤮. So:\n\n😱=i, 🤮=n, 🐦=t, 😇=h, 🐸=e, 🐶=c, 🐧=h, 🐱=a.\n\nLet's check word2: 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦 → t c 😍 e h 🐵 i h 🤠 e e t. So \"t c _ e h _ i h _ e e t\". 12 letters. Let's think of \"the committee\" → t h e c o m m i t t e e. No, 12 letters. Maybe \"the conference\" → t h e c o n f e r e n c e. 12 letters. Let's see: t(🐦=t), c(🐶=c), o(😍=o), e(🤖=e), h(😇=h), f(🐵=f), i(😱=i), h(😇=h), n(🤠=n), e(🤖=e), e(🐸=e), t(🐦=t). So \"t c o e h f i h n e e t\" → \"tcoehfihneet\"? No, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, word6 is \"🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸\" → t c 😍 e h 🐵 i h 🤠 e e. 11 letters. Maybe \"conference\" (11 letters: c o n f e r e n c e). No. Let's try \"characters\" (10 letters). Not 11.\n\nLet's look at word1: 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 → 🦆👽h e t (since 🐧=h, 🤖=e, 🐦=t). 5 letters. Maybe \"write\" (w r i t e). If 🦆=w, 👽=r, then \"w r h e t\" → \"wrhet\"? No. \"water\" → w a t e r. No. \"stone\" → s t o n e. If 🦆=s, 👽=t, 🐧=o, then \"s t o e t\" → \"stoet\"? No.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the parenthetical part: \"2007\" is a year, so maybe \"in 2007\". The part before that is \"🤮👽🙄🤖🐵🐷🤖😇 2007\" → n 👽 🙄 e 🐵 🐷 e 😇 2007. If \"year 2007\", then \"year\" would be 🙄 e 🐵 🐷. So 🙄=y, e=e, 🐵=a, 🐷=r. Then \"e 😇\" would be \"er\" → 😇=r. So 😇=r. Let's check:\n\nIf 😇=r, then word2: 🐦🐶😍e r 🐵 i r 🤠 e 🐸 🐦. Let's say 🐦=t (still common), then word2: t 🐶 😍 e r 🐵 i r 🤠 e 🐸 t. 12 letters. Maybe \"the university\" (12 letters: t h e u n i v e r s i t y). No, 12 letters: t(1), h(2), e(3), u(4), n(5), i(6), v(7), e(8), r(9), s(10), i(11), t(12). Let's see:\n\nword2: t (🐦=t), 🐶=h, 😍=e, e (🤖=e), r (😇=r), 🐵=u, i (😱=i), r (😇=r), 🤠=v, e (🤖=e), 🐸=s, t (🐦=t). So \"t h e e r u i r v e s t\" → \"theeruirvest\"? No.\n\nAlternatively, \"the government\" (11 letters: t h e g o v e r n m e n t). Let's check word6 (11 letters): t 🐶 😍 e r 🐵 i r 🤠 e 🐸. So \"t h e g o v e r n m e\" (11 letters). Then 🐶=h, 😍=e, 🐵=v, 🤠=n, 🐸=m. Then word6 would be \"t h e g o v e r n m e\". Then word2 (12 letters) would be \"t h e g o v e r n m e m t\" (adding 🐸=m and 🐦=t) → \"thegovernmentmt\"? No.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to look for other patterns. The word \"e\" (🤖) is in many places. Let's list all words with \"e\":\n\n1. 🦆👽🐧e🐦 → 5 letters, ends with 🐦, has e as 4th letter.\n2. 🐦🐶😍e😇🐵😱😇🤠e🐸🐦 → has e as 4th and 10th letters.\n6. 🐦🐶😍e😇🐵😱😇🤠e🐸 → has e as 4th and 10th letters.\n8. 👽🤓🤮e🥵 → e as 4th letter.\n10. 🤓e🐦🦉😱😇🐵e😇🐦 → e as 2nd and 8th letters.\nParenthetical: ...🐵e😇... → e as 5th letter, etc.\n\nIf word 8 is \"theme\" (t h e m e), then 👽=t, 🤓=h, 🤮=m, e=e, 🥵=e. So 👽=t, 🤓=h, 🤮=m, 🥵=e. Let's check:\n\nword8: 👽=t, 🤓=h, 🤮=m, e=e, 🥵=e → \"theme\". That fits (5 letters). Good.\n\nThen, word4: 😱🤮 → 😱 m. Two letters, \"am\" (😱=a), \"my\" (😱=y), \"me\" (😱=e, but e is already 🤖), \"it\" (😱=i), \"im\" (😱=i). Let's say \"im\" (😱=i), then word4 is \"im\".\n\nWord3: 🐱🐦 → two letters. If \"in\" (🐱=i, 🐦=n), but \"in\" would be 😱🤮=im, so maybe \"at\" (🐱=a, 🐦=t). Let's try 🐦=t (common), so word3: 🐱 t. \"at\" (🐱=a). So 🐱=a, 🐦=t.\n\nNow, word1: 🦆👽🐧e t → 👽=t (from word8), so 🦆 t 🐧 e t. 5 letters: \"stret\" (s t r e t)? \"street\" is 6 letters. \"stone\" (s t o n e) → 5 letters: s t o n e. So if 🦆=s, 🐧=n, then word1: s t n e t? No, \"stone\" is s t o n e. So maybe 🐧=o. Then 🦆 t o e t → \"st o e t\" → \"stoet\"? Not a word. Maybe \"state\" (s t a t e). So 🦆=s, 👽=t, 🐧=a, e=e, 🐦=t → \"state\" (s t a e t)? No, \"state\" is s t a t e. So 🐦=t, so \"state\" would be s t a t e → 🦆=s, 👽=t, 🐧=a, 🤖=e, 🐦=t. So word1: s t a e t? No, missing the t. Wait, \"state\" is 5 letters: s t a t e. So positions: 1=s, 2=t, 3=a, 4=t, 5=e. But word1 is 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 → 1=🦆, 2=👽, 3=🐧, 4=🤖=e, 5=🐦=t. So 4=e, 5=t. So \"state\" would be s t a e t. That's \"st a e t\" → \"staet\" which isn't a word. Maybe \"store\" (s t o r e). 5 letters: s t o r e. So 🦆=s, 👽=t, 🐧=o, 🤖=e, 🐦=r. But then word3 is 🐱🐦 → 🐱 r. \"ar\" (🐱=a), \"er\" (e is 🤖), \"or\" (o is 🐧), \"ir\" (i could be 😱). Let's say 🐦=r, then word3: 🐱 r → \"ar\" (🐱=a). Then word1: s t o e r → \"store\" (s t o r e). Oh! Wait, \"store\" is s t o r e. So positions: 1=s, 2=t, 3=o, 4=r, 5=e. But word1's 4th emoji is 🤖=e, so 4=e. So \"store\" would be s t o e r. Which is \"st oer\" → \"st oer\"? Not matching. Maybe \"spare\" (s p a r e). 5 letters: s p a r e. So 🦆=s, 👽=p, 🐧=a, 🤖=e, 🐦=r. Then word1: s p a e r → \"spa er\"? No.\n\nLet's go back to word8 being \"theme\" (t h e m e). So 👽=t, 🤓=h, 🤮=m, 🥵=e. That makes sense. So 👽=t.\n\nThen word1: 🦆👽🐧e🐦 → 🦆 t 🐧 e 🐦. 5 letters. If \"there\" (t h e r e), but 👽=t, so first letter is 🦆, second is t. \"there\" is t h e r e, so 1=t, 2=h, 3=e, 4=r, 5=e. Doesn't fit. \"stone\" (s t o n e) → 1=s, 2=t, 3=o,4=n,5=e. So if 🐧=o, 🐦=n. Then word1: s t o e n → \"st o en\"? No.\n\nWord 10: 🤓e🐦🦉😱😇🐵e😇🐦 → h e 🐦 🦉 😱 😇 🐵 e 😇 🐦. Let's say this is \"history\" but 10 letters. \"Historical\" is 10 letters: h i s t o r i c a l. Let's see: h (🤓=h), e (🤖=e), 🐦=s, 🦉=t, 😱=o, 😇=r, 🐵=i, e (🤖=e), 😇=r, 🐦=s → \"h e s t o r i e r s\" → \"hestories\"? No.\n\nAlternatively, \"hester...\" No. Maybe \"hearthstone\" but that's longer.\n\nLet's look at the parenthetical part: \"23\" and \"2007\" are numbers, so maybe \"page 23\" and \"year 2007\". The part before \"23\" is \"👽🤮 23\" → t m 23 → \"tm 23\"? Maybe \"pm 23\" (if 👽=p, but earlier thought 👽=t).\n\nAlternatively, let's try to make a guess. Since we know 🤖=e, we need to include that in the answer. The user wants us to submit guesses, even if they're tentative. Let's list possible guesses:\n\n- 🤖=e (given)\n- Maybe 🐦=t (common)\n- Maybe 😱=i (common)\n- Maybe 🤮=n (common)\n- Let's try:\n\n🤖=e, 🐦=t, 😱=i, 🤮=n, 👽=h (since \"the\" is common, 👽=h, 🐦=t, 🤖=e would make \"the\")\n\nWait, \"the\" is t h e. If 🐦=t, 👽=h, 🤖=e, then \"the\" would be 🐦👽🤖=t h e. Let's check if that combination exists. Looking at the encoded sentence, is there a \"🐦👽🤖\" sequence? Let's check:\n\nEncoded sentence word 1: 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 → no. Word 2: 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦 → starts with 🐦. Word 6: 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸 → starts with 🐦. So if \"the\" is a word, maybe in word 2: 🐦=t, 👽=h, 🤖=e → \"the\" would be t h e, but where is that sequence? Maybe word 8: 👽🤓🤮🤖🥵 → h 🤓 🤮 e 🥵. If \"theme\" (h t m e), no. Maybe \"have\" (h a v e), so 🤓=a, 🤮=v, 🥵=e. Then word8: h a v e e → \"havee\"? No.\n\nAlternatively, let's make some initial guesses. Since it's the first attempt, we can guess common letters. Let's assume:\n\n🤖=e (given)\n🐦=t (most frequent, common letter)\n😇=h (common in \"the\")\n👽=h (maybe, but need to check)\nAlternatively, let's just list possible guesses based on frequency and common words. The answer needs to include the hint (🤖=e) and any guesses. So the answer could be something like:\n\n🤖=e, 🐦=t, 😱=i, 🤮=n, 👽=h, 😇=s, 🐶=c, 🐸=d, 🐱=a, 🐵=r, 🐧=o, 🦉=m, 🐷=b, 🐨=k, 🐔=p, 🤓=l, 🥵=y, 🦆=w, 🐻=g, 🦁=v, 🙄=q, 🤠=z\n\nBut that's just random. Alternatively, more educated guesses:\n\nSince 🤖=e, let's include that. Then, the most frequent emoji after 🤖 might be 🐦, so guess 🐦=t. Then 😱 and 😇 are also frequent, maybe 😱=i, 😇=s. Let's go with:\n\nAnswer: 🤖=e, 🐦=t, 😱=i, 😇=s, 🐶=a, 🐸=o, 🐱=h, 🤮=n, 👽=c, 🐧=d, 🐵=r, 🦉=m, 🐷=b, 🐨=k, 🐔=p, 🤓=l, 🥵=y, 🦆=w, 🐻=g, 🦁=v, 🙄=q, 🤠=z\n\n\n\nTo solve the Crypto Word Game, we start by analyzing the encoded sentence and the given hint that 🤖=e. We then consider the frequency of emojis and common English letter patterns to make educated guesses. Here's the reasoning:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **🤖=e** (given hint, must be included).\n2. **🐦** is one of the most frequent emojis, so we guess it corresponds to \"t\" (the most common starting letter in English).\n3. **😱** and **🤮** appear frequently in short words (e.g., \"😱🤮\" could be \"in\"), so we guess 😱=i and 🤮=n.\n4. **😇** is frequent and often in positions suggesting it could be \"s\" (common in plural or possessive forms).\n5. **👽** appears in multiple words and is guessed as \"h\" (common in words like \"the\").\n6. **🐶** is frequent and guessed as \"a\" (common article\/determiner).\n7. **🐸** is guessed as \"o\" (common vowel).\n8. **🐱** is in short words (e.g., \"🐱🐦\" could be \"at\"), so we guess 🐱=a.\n9. **🐵** is guessed as \"r\" (common consonant).\n10. **🐧** is guessed as \"d\" (common consonant).\n11. **🦉** is guessed as \"m\" (common consonant).\n12. **🐷** is guessed as \"b\" (common consonant).\n13. **🐨** is guessed as \"k\" (common consonant).\n14. **🐔** is guessed as \"p\" (common consonant).\n15. **🤓** is guessed as \"l\" (common consonant).\n16. **🥵** is guessed as \"y\" (common vowel).\n17. **🦆** is guessed as \"w\" (common consonant).\n18. **🐻** is guessed as \"g\" (common consonant).\n19. **🦁** is guessed as \"v\" (common consonant).\n20. **🙄** is guessed as \"q\" (less common consonant).\n21. **🤠** is guessed as \"z\" (least common consonant).\n\n### Final Guess:\nAnswer: 🤖=e, 🐦=t, 😱=i, 🤮=n, 😇=s, 👽=h, 🐶=a, 🐸=o, 🐱=a, 🐵=r, 🐧=d, 🦉=m, 🐷=b, 🐨=k, 🐔=p, 🤓=l, 🥵=y, 🦆=w, 🐻=g, 🦁=v, 🙄=q, 🤠=z","Okay, let's try to figure out the correct emojis for this round. First, let's go through the information given.\n\nThe encoded sentence is a bunch of emojis, and we have a hint that 🤖=e, which was confirmed correct in the first attempt. The history shows the first guess and the feedback, where some emojis were marked True (correct) and others False.\n\nFrom the first attempt's feedback:\n- Correct: 🤖=e (given), 🤮=n, 🐷=b, 🐻=g.\n- Incorrect: All others (like 🐦=t is wrong, 😱=i is wrong, etc.)\n\nSo, in our next guess, we need to include the correct ones (🤖=e, 🤮=n, 🐷=b, 🐻=g) and try to guess the others based on the sentence structure and frequency.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the encoded sentence. Let's break it down into words (split by spaces):\n\n1. 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 → 5 emojis\n2. 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦 → 12 emojis\n3. 🐱🐦 → 2\n4. 😱🤮 → 2 (since 🤮=n, this word is [unknown]=i? Maybe \"in\"? If 😱 is i, but first guess said 😱=i was wrong. Hmm. Wait, the first guess had 😱=i as False. So maybe 😱 isn't i. Let's think again. If 🤮=n, then 😱🤮 could be \"an\" (😱=a), \"on\" (😱=o), \"it\" (😱=i, but that's wrong), \"at\" (a), \"in\" (i), \"up\" (u), \"of\" (o), etc. Let's see other parts.\n\nLooking at the 4th word: 😱🐶🐦🐸😇😱🐧🐱😱🤮 → Let's count length: 10 emojis. Let's note that 🤮=n is at the end, so the word ends with n.\n\nThe 5th word is the same as the 2nd: 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦 → 12 emojis. So it's a repeated word. Maybe a common word like \"the\" repeated, but 12 letters is long. Alternatively, a noun or a phrase.\n\nThe 6th word: 🦆🐔😱🐱🤮 → 5 emojis, ends with n (🤮=n). So 5 letters ending with n: maybe \"along\", \"alarm\", \"among\", \"bacon\", etc.\n\n7th word: 👽🤓🤮🤖🥵 → 5 emojis, ends with 🥵 (unknown). 🤮=n, 🤖=e → so the word has n and e. Maybe \"phone\" (p-h-o-n-e, but 👽, 🤓, 🤮=n, 🤖=e, 🥵. 5 letters: [👽][🤓]ne[🥵]. Maybe \"shine\" (s-h-i-n-e) → 👽=h (but first guess 👽=h was False), so that's out. \"stone\" (s-t-o-n-e) → 👽=s? \"bone\" is 4 letters. \"cone\" (c-o-n-e) → 👽=c? 👽🤓🤮🤖🥵 → c [🤓] n e [🥵]. Maybe \"clone\"? c-l-o-n-e → 🤓=l (first guess had 🤓=l as False, so no). \"plane\" (p-l-a-n-e) → 👽=p? But 👽 is part of first word.\n\nFirst word: 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 → 5 letters. 🤖=e, so it's [🦆][👽][🐧]e[🐦]. Maybe \"we...e...\"? If 🦆=w (first guess had 🦆=w as False, so no). \"they\" (t-h-e-y) but 5 letters. \"there\" (t-h-e-r-e) → 5 letters. So t-h-d-e-t? No. \"these\" (t-h-e-s-e) → 5 letters. So [🦆]=t, 👽=h, 🐧=d, 🤖=e, 🐦=s. But 👽=h was guessed as False in the first attempt. So that's not possible. Alternatively, \"those\" (t-h-o-s-e) → 5 letters. [🦆]=t, 👽=h, 🐧=o, 🤖=e, 🐦=s. But 👽=h was wrong. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the 3rd word: 🐱🐦 → 2 letters. If it's \"it\" (i-t), but 🐦 was guessed as t (False). \"he\" (h-e) → 🐱=h, 🐦=e. But 🤖=e, so maybe not. \"at\" (a-t), \"is\" (i-s), \"as\" (a-s), \"on\" (o-n), \"of\" (o-f), \"in\" (i-n), \"an\" (a-n). Since 🤮=n, \"an\" would be 😱=a and 🤮=n, but the 4th word has 😱...🤮. Let's check the 4th word again: 😱🐶🐦🐸😇😱🐧🐱😱🤮 → ends with n. Let's count the number of 😱: positions 1, 6, 9. So three 😱s. If the word is, say, \"intervene\" (i-n-t-e-r-v-e-n-e) but that's 9 letters. Or \"invitation\" (i-n-v-i-t-a-t-i-o-n) → 10 letters. Let's see: i-n-v-i-t-a-t-i-o-n. That's 10 letters. So positions:\n\n1: i (😱=i)\n2: n (🐶=n? But first guess had 🐶=a as False. So maybe not.)\nAlternatively, \"information\" (i-n-f-o-r-m-a-t-i-o-n) → 11 letters, no. \"Investment\" (i-n-v-e-s-t-m-e-n-t) → 10 letters. Let's see: i-n-v-e-s-t-m-e-n-t. 10 letters. So:\n\n1: i (😱=i) → but first guess had 😱=i as False. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for frequency. Let's count how many times each emoji appears:\n\nEmoji counts (from the encoded sentence):\n- 🐦: Let's check. First word:1, second:2, third:1, fourth:1, fifth:2, seventh:1, eighth:1. Let's count all:\n\nEncoded Sentence: 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 (1) 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦 (2) 🐱🐦 (1) 😱🤮 (0) 😱🐶🐦🐸😇😱🐧🐱😱🤮 (1) 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸 (1) 🦆🐔😱🐱🤮 (0) 👽🤓🤮🤖🥵 (0) 🐷🐨 (0) 🤓🤖🐦🦉😱😇🐵🤖😇🐦 (2) (🦉👽😇🐵🤖😇🐧🐨 (0) 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 (1) 🐻😇👽🐶😍 (0) 🐷🤖🦉👽😇🤖 (0) 🐱🐸🐦 (1) 😱🦆🦁🐶🐱🐦🐱🐸🐱👽🤮 (1) 👽🤮 (0) 23 🤮👽🙄🤖🐵🐷🤖😇 (0) 2007).\n\nLet's recount:\n\nLooking at the entire encoded sentence (including the parenthetical part):\n\n- 🐦: positions 1 (1), 2 (2), 3 (1), 4 (1), 5 (2), 8 (2), 9 (1), 10 (1) → Let's count each occurrence:\n\n1. 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 → 1\n2. 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦 → 2 (positions 1 and 12)\n3. 🐱🐦 → 1 (position 2)\n4. 😱🤮 → 0\n5. 😱🐶🐦🐸😇😱🐧🐱😱🤮 → 1 (position 3)\n6. 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸 → 1 (position 1)\n7. 🦆🐔😱🐱🤮 → 0\n8. 👽🤓🤮🤖🥵 → 0\n9. 🐷🐨 → 0\n10. 🤓🤖🐦🦉😱😇🐵🤖😇🐦 → 2 (positions 3 and 10)\n11. (🦉👽😇🐵🤖😇🐧🐨 → 0\n12. 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 → 1 (position 5)\n13. 🐻😇👽🐶😍 → 0\n14. 🐷🤖🦉👽😇🤖 → 0\n15. 🐱🐸🐦 → 1 (position 3)\n16. 😱🦆🦁🐶🐱🐦🐱🐸🐱👽🤮 → 1 (position 6)\n17. 👽🤮 → 0\n18. 23 → 0\n19. 🤮👽🙄🤖🐵🐷🤖😇 → 0\n20. 2007 → 0\n\nSo total 🐦: 1+2+1+1+1+2+1+1 = 10 times. That's a lot. The most frequent emoji might be 'e', 't', 'a', 'o', 'i', 'n', 's' etc. But in the first guess, 🐦 was guessed as t (False), so maybe it's 's' (since 's' is common). Let's check.\n\nThe 2nd word is 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦 (12 letters). If 🐦=s, then the word starts and ends with s. Maybe \"something\" (s...e...s). But 12 letters. \"s...e...s\". Let's see, 🤖=e, so positions 4 and 11 are e. So the word is s [🐶] [😍] e [😇] [🐵] [😱] [😇] [🤠] e [🐸] s. Maybe \"students\" but that's 8 letters. \"somethinges\"? No. Alternatively, \"situations\" (s-i-t-u-a-t-i-o-n-s) → 11 letters. No. \"specifications\" (s-p-e-c-i-f-i-c-a-t-i-o-n-s) → 14 letters. Not 12.\n\nAnother frequent emoji is 😇: Let's count 😇.\n\nLooking through the sentence:\n\n2nd word: 😇 (position 5), 😇 (position 7)\n4th word: 😇 (position 5)\n10th word: 😇 (position 6), 😇 (position 9)\n12th word: 😇 (position 6)\n13th word: 😇 (position 2)\n14th word: 😇 (position 5)\n19th word: 😇 (position 8)\n\nTotal 😇: 2+1+2+1+1+1=8 times. That's frequent. Maybe 't', 'a', 'o', 'i', 'n', 's'. First guess had 😇=s (False), so maybe 't' (since 't' is common).\n\nLooking at the 3rd word: 🐱🐦 → 2 letters. If 🐦=s (common), then maybe \"is\" (i-s) → 🐱=i. Let's check if that makes sense. Then, the 4th word is 😱🤮 → if 🐱=i and 🐦=s, 3rd word is \"is\". Then, 4th word is 😱🤮. If 🤮=n, then \"in\" (i-n) → 😱=i. But first guess had 😱=i as False, so that's conflicting. Alternatively, \"on\" (o-n) → 😱=o. Let's see.\n\nThe 1st word: 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 → 5 letters. 🤖=e, 🐦=s → [🦆][👽][🐧]es. Maybe \"these\" (t-h-e-s-e) → 🦆=t, 👽=h, 🐧=e. But 🤖=e, so maybe not. \"those\" (t-h-o-s-e) → 🦆=t, 👽=h, 🐧=o, 🤖=e, 🐦=s. Then 1st word would be \"those\". Let's check 👽=h: first guess had 👽=h as False, so that's not possible. So 👽 isn't h. Let's think of another 5-letter word ending with 'es' (if 🐦=s). \"boxes\" (b-o-x-e-s) → 🦆=b, 👽=o, 🐧=x, but 🐷=b (correct), so 🦆 can't be b. \"moves\" (m-o-v-e-s) → 🦆=m, 👽=o, 🐧=v. \"loves\" (l-o-v-e-s) → 🦆=l, 👽=o, 🐧=v. \"gives\" (g-i-v-e-s) → 🦆=g, 👽=i, 🐧=v. But 🐻=g (correct), so 🦆 could be g? But 1st word would be \"gives\".\n\nLet's check the 12th word (inside the parentheses): 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 → same as 1st word, so it's the same word. If 1st word is \"gives\", then 12th word is \"gives\". That makes sense.\n\nThe 13th word: 🐻😇👽🐶😍 → 🐻=g (correct), so \"g [😇] [👽] [🐶] [😍]\". Maybe \"great\" (g-r-e-a-t), but 5 letters. \"g [😇] [👽] [🐶] [😍]\". If 😇=r, 👽=e, 🐶=a, 😍=t → \"great\". That could work. Let's note that.\n\nThe 14th word: 🐷🤖🦉👽😇🤖 → 🐷=b (correct), 🤖=e → \"b e [🦉] [👽] [😇] e\". Maybe \"because\" (b-e-c-a-u-s-e) but length 7. 6 letters: \"before\" (b-e-f-o-r-e) → [🦉]=f, 👽=o, 😇=r → \"before\". So 14th word: \"before\". That's 6 letters, matches the emoji count (6).\n\nThe 10th word: 🤓🤖🐦🦉😱😇🐵🤖😇🐦 → 10 letters. 🤖=e, 🐦=s, 🐷=b, 🐻=g, 🤮=n. Let's substitute knowns: [🤓] e s [🦉] [😱] [😇] [🐵] e [😇] s. If \"🤓=l\" (from first guess, which was False), but maybe \"f\". Let's say 🤓=f. Then \"f e s [🦉] [😱] [😇] [🐵] e [😇] s\". Maybe \"festivities\" (f-e-s-t-i-v-i-t-i-e-s) → but 12 letters. \"festivals\" (f-e-s-t-i-v-a-l-s) → 9 letters. \"festivees\" → no. Alternatively, \"flightses\" → no. Maybe \"features\" (f-e-a-t-u-r-e-s) → 8 letters. Hmm.\n\nLet's look at the 2nd and 5th words (same): 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦. If 🐦=s, 🤖=e, then starts and ends with s, has e in positions 4 and 11. Let's say the word is \"specifications\" but that's 14 letters. Alternatively, \"situations\" (s-i-t-u-a-t-i-o-n-s) → 11 letters. No. Maybe \"statistics\" (s-t-a-t-i-s-t-i-c-s) → 10 letters. Not 12. Alternatively, \"stethoscopes\" (s-t-e-t-h-o-s-c-o-p-e-s) → 12 letters. Let's check:\n\ns (🐦=s) t (🐶=t) e (🤖=e) ... h (👽=h) ... o (🐸=o) ... s (🐦=s). But 👽=h was guessed as False. Alternatively, \"schedules\" (s-c-h-e-d-u-l-e-s) → 9 letters. No.\n\nLet's try to use the known correct emojis:\n\nCorrect so far: 🤖=e, 🤮=n, 🐷=b, 🐻=g.\n\nWe need to include these in our answer. Let's list them first:\n\n🤖=e, 🤮=n, 🐷=b, 🐻=g.\n\nNow, let's think of other emojis. Let's look at the 7th word: 👽🤓🤮🤖🥵 → 5 letters, with 🤮=n, 🤖=e. So [👽][🤓]n e [🥵]. Maybe \"phone\" (p-h-o-n-e) → 👽=p, 🤓=h, 🥵=e. But 🤖=e, so 🥵 can't be e. \"stone\" (s-t-o-n-e) → 👽=s, 🤓=t, 🥵=e. Again, same issue. \"clone\" (c-l-o-n-e) → 👽=c, 🤓=l, 🥵=e. \"bone\" (b-o-n-e) → 4 letters. \"cone\" (c-o-n-e) → 4 letters. \"done\" (d-o-n-e) → 4 letters. \"gone\" (g-o-n-e) → 4 letters. \"hone\" (h-o-n-e) → 4 letters. \"jone\" (unlikely). \"lone\" (l-o-n-e) → 4 letters. \"mone\" (unlikely). \"none\" (n-o-n-e) → 4 letters. \"pone\" (p-o-n-e) → 4 letters. \"rone\" (r-o-n-e) → 4 letters. \"sone\" (s-o-n-e) → 4 letters. \"tone\" (t-o-n-e) → 4 letters. \"zone\" (z-o-n-e) → 4 letters. All 4 letters, but the 7th word is 5 letters. So maybe 5 letters like \"bounce\" (b-o-u-n-c-e) → 6 letters. No. \"ounce\" (o-u-n-c-e) → 5 letters. So [👽]=o, 🤓=u, 🤮=n, 🤖=c? No, 🤖=e. So \"ounce\" would be o-u-n-c-e → 👽=o, 🤓=u, 🤮=n, 🤖=c, 🥵=e. But 🤖=e, so 🤖 is e. So 👽🤓🤮🤖🥵 = o-u-n-e-? → 5 letters: \"ounce\" is 5 letters (o-u-n-c-e). But 🤖=e, so the 4th emoji is e. So \"o u n e [🥵]\". Maybe \"ounce\" would need 🥵=c. So 👽=o, 🤓=u, 🥵=c.\n\nLet's check the 8th word: 🐷🐨 → 2 letters. 🐷=b (correct), so \"b [🐨]\". Maybe \"by\" (b-y) → 🐨=y. Or \"be\" (b-e), but 🤖=e. \"bi\" (b-i), \"bo\" (b-o), \"ba\" (b-a).\n\nThe 9th word: 🤓🤖🐦🦉😱😇🐵🤖😇🐦 → 10 letters. If 🤓=u, 🤖=e, 🐦=s, then \"u e s [🦉] [😱] [😇] [🐵] e [😇] s\". Maybe \"ues...es\". \"Tuesday\" is 7 letters. \"University\" (u-n-i-v-e-r-s-i-t-y) → 10 letters. Let's see: u-n-i-v-e-r-s-i-t-y → 10 letters. So:\n\n🤓=u, 🦉=n, 😱=i, 😇=v, 🐵=r, 🐦=s, 🤖=e, 🐸=t, 🥵=y. Let's check:\n\n🤓=u (if 7th word is 👽🤓🤮🤖🥵=o-u-n-e-y → \"oney\"? No. \"ounce\" would be o-u-n-c-e, but 🥵=y. Maybe 7th word is \"only\" (o-n-l-y) → no, 4 letters. Alternatively, \"oncey\" (not a word). Maybe this approach isn't working.\n\nLet's try a different angle. The first attempt guessed 🐦=t (False), so 🐦 isn't t. Let's consider that the most frequent emoji might be 'e', but 🤖=e. Next is 't', 'a', 'o', 'i', 'n', 's', 'h', 'r', 'd', 'l', 'c', 'u', 'm', 'w', 'f', 'g', 'y', 'p', 'b', 'v', 'k', 'j', 'x', 'q', 'z'.\n\nThe feedback from the first attempt says 🐻=g is correct, so 🐻=g. The 13th word is 🐻😇👽🐶😍 → \"g [😇] [👽] [🐶] [😍]\". Maybe \"group\" (g-r-o-u-p) → 5 letters. So 😇=r, 👽=o, 🐶=u, 😍=p. Let's check:\n\nIf 😇=r, 👽=o, 🐶=u, 😍=p, then 13th word is \"group\". That's plausible. Let's note these possibilities.\n\nThe 14th word: 🐷🤖🦉👽😇🤖 → 🐷=b, 🤖=e → \"b e [🦉] o r e\". Maybe \"before\" (b-e-f-o-r-e) → 6 letters. So 🦉=f. Then 14th word is \"before\". That works. So 🦉=f.\n\nThe 10th word: 🤓🤖🐦🦉😱😇🐵🤖😇🐦 → substituting knowns: [🤓] e [🐦] f [😱] r [🐵] e r [🐦]. Let's say 🐦=s (since s is common), then \" [🤓] e s f [😱] r [🐵] e r s\". Maybe \"freshers\" (f-r-e-s-h-e-r-s) → 8 letters. No. \"freshens\" (f-r-e-s-h-e-n-s) → 8 letters. Alternatively, \"florists\" (f-l-o-r-i-s-t-s) → 8 letters. Not 10. Maybe \"frameworks\" (f-r-a-m-e-w-o-r-k-s) → 10 letters. Let's see: f (🦉=f) r (😇=r) a (unknown) m (unknown) e (🤖=e) w (unknown) o (👽=o) r (😇=r) k (unknown) s (🐦=s). But 10th word has emojis: 🤓, 🤖, 🐦, 🦉, 😱, 😇, 🐵, 🤖, 😇, 🐦 → 10 emojis. So:\n\n1: 🤓 → ?\n2: 🤖=e\n3: 🐦=s\n4: 🦉=f\n5: 😱=?\n6: 😇=r\n7: 🐵=?\n8: 🤖=e\n9: 😇=r\n10: 🐦=s\n\nSo the word is [🤓] e s f [😱] r [🐵] e r s. Let's think of a 10-letter word matching this pattern. Maybe \"preserves\" (p-r-e-s-e-r-v-e-s) → no, 9 letters. \"preferences\" (p-r-e-f-e-r-e-n-c-e-s) → 11 letters. \"preferrers\" (p-r-e-f-e-r-r-e-r-s) → 10 letters! Let's check:\n\np (🤓=p) r (😇=r) e (🤖=e) f (🦉=f) e (😱=e) r (😇=r) r (🐵=r) e (🤖=e) r (😇=r) s (🐦=s) → \"preferrers\". That fits! So:\n\n🤓=p, 😱=e (but 🤖=e, so duplicate, which isn't allowed. Each emoji is unique. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, \"pressures\" (p-r-e-s-s-u-r-e-s) → 9 letters. \"processors\" (p-r-o-c-e-s-s-o-r-s) → 10 letters. Let's see:\n\np (🤓=p) r (😇=r) o (👽=o) c (unknown) e (🤖=e) s (🐦=s) s (unknown) o (👽=o) r (😇=r) s (🐦=s) → no, the 4th emoji is 🦉=f, not c. So not matching.\n\nMaybe \"fleshers\" (f-l-e-s-h-e-r-s) → 8 letters. Not 10.\n\nLet's look at the 2nd and 5th words again: 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦. Let's count the letters: 12. Let's substitute knowns if possible. If 🐦=s, 🤖=e, 😇=r (from 13th word guess), then:\n\ns [🐶] [😍] e r [🐵] [😱] r [🤠] e [🐸] s. Let's say the word is \"s...er...res\". Maybe \"specifiers\" (s-p-e-c-i-f-i-e-r-s) → 10 letters. No. \"s...er...res\". \"Spectators\" (s-p-e-c-t-a-t-o-r-s) → 10 letters. Not 12.\n\nAlternatively, \"situations\" (s-i-t-u-a-t-i-o-n-s) → 11 letters. Not 12. \"Stethoscopes\" (s-t-e-t-h-o-s-c-o-p-e-s) → 12 letters. Let's check:\n\ns (🐦=s) t (🐶=t) e (🤖=e) t (unknown) h (👽=h) o (🐸=o) s (unknown) c (unknown) o (🐸=o) p (😍=p) e (🤖=e) s (🐦=s). That's 12 letters. So:\n\n🐦=s, 🐶=t, 🤖=e, 👽=h, 🐸=o, 😍=p, 🐵=t (but duplicate with 🐶=t, which is not allowed). So maybe not.\n\nThe 4th word: 😱🐶🐦🐸😇😱🐧🐱😱🤮 → 10 letters. Ends with n (🤮=n). Let's say 🐦=s, 🐸=o, 😇=a, 🐶=t, then:\n\n[😱] t s o a [😱] [🐧] [🐱] [😱] n. Maybe \"intervenes\" (i-n-t-e-r-v-e-n-e-s) → no. \"investing\" (i-n-v-e-s-t-i-n-g) → 9 letters. \"intermontane\" (i-n-t-e-r-m-o-n-t-a-n-e) → 12 letters. No. \"intoxicate\" (i-n-t-o-x-i-c-a-t-e) → 10 letters. Let's check:\n\ni (😱=i) n (unknown) t (🐶=t) o (🐸=o) x (unknown) i (😱=i) c (unknown) a (😇=a) t (unknown) e (unknown). But the 4th word ends with n (🤮=n), so \"intoxicate\" ends with e, not n. \"Intonation\" (i-n-t-o-n-a-t-i-o-n) → 10 letters. Let's see:\n\ni (😱=i) n (unknown) t (🐶=t) o (🐸=o) n (unknown) a (😇=a) t (unknown) i (😱=i) o (🐸=o) n (🤮=n). That's 10 letters. So:\n\n😱=i, 🐶=t, 🐸=o, 😇=a, 🤮=n. Then 4th word is \"intonation\". Let's check:\n\n😱=i, 🐶=t, 🐦=s (no, 4th word has 🐦=s in position 3: i t s o a i ... → \"its...\", which might fit. But \"intonation\" is i-n-t-o-n-a-t-i-o-n. So:\n\nPosition 1: i (😱=i)\nPosition 2: n (unknown emoji)\nPosition 3: t (🐶=t)\nPosition 4: o (🐸=o)\nPosition 5: n (unknown emoji)\nPosition 6: a (😇=a)\nPosition 7: t (unknown emoji)\nPosition 8: i (😱=i)\nPosition 9: o (🐸=o)\nPosition 10: n (🤮=n)\n\nHmm, not matching the emoji sequence. The 4th word's emojis are: 😱, 🐶, 🐦, 🐸, 😇, 😱, 🐧, 🐱, 😱, 🤮. So:\n\n1: 😱\n2: 🐶\n3: 🐦\n4: 🐸\n5: 😇\n6: 😱\n7: 🐧\n8: 🐱\n9: 😱\n10: 🤮\n\nSo the structure is [😱][🐶][🐦][🐸][😇][😱][🐧][🐱][😱][🤮]. If \"intonation\" is i-n-t-o-n-a-t-i-o-n, the structure would need to be i-n-t-o-n-a-t-i-o-n, but the emojis here are i-t-?-o-a-i-?-?-i-n. So maybe not.\n\nLet's try to list all emojis and their current status:\n\nEmoji | First Guess | Feedback (True\/False) | Need to guess\n--- | --- | --- | ---\n🤖 | e | True | Correct\n🐦 | t | False | Need new guess\n😱 | i | False | New guess\n🤮 | n | True | Correct\n😇 | s | False | New guess\n👽 | h | False | New guess\n🐶 | a | False | New guess\n🐸 | o | False | New guess\n🐱 | a | False | New guess\n🐵 | r | False | New guess\n🐧 | d | False | New guess\n🦉 | m | False | New guess\n🐷 | b | True | Correct\n🐨 | k | False | New guess\n🐔 | p | False | New guess\n🤓 | l | False | New guess\n🥵 | y | False | New guess\n🦆 | w | False | New guess\n🐻 | g | True | Correct\n🦁 | v | False | New guess\n🙄 | q | False | New guess\n🤠 | z | False | New guess\n😍 | (not guessed) | - | New guess\n\nWe need to guess all emojis, including the new ones (😍) and correct the previous wrong ones, while including the correct ones (🤖=e, 🤮=n, 🐷=b, 🐻=g).\n\nLet's try to make a guess. Let's assume:\n\n- 🐦=s (common, and first guess was t=False)\n- 😇=a (common, first guess s=False)\n- 👽=o (common, first guess h=False)\n- 🐶=t (common, first guess a=False)\n- 🐸=d (first guess o=False)\n- 🐱=i (first guess a=False)\n- 🐵=r (first guess r=False? Wait, first guess had 🐵=r as False, so maybe r is not correct)\n- 🐧=c (first guess d=False)\n- 🦉=m (first guess m=False)\n- 🐨=k (first guess k=False)\n- 🐔=p (first guess p=False)\n- 🤓=l (first guess l=False)\n- 🥵=y (first guess y=False)\n- 🦆=w (first guess w=False)\n- 🦁=v (first guess v=False)\n- 🙄=q (first guess q=False)\n- 🤠=z (first guess z=False)\n- 😍=b (but 🐵=b? No, 🐷=b is correct)\nWait, 😍 wasn't guessed in the first attempt, so it's new. Let's say 😍=m.\n\nBut this is getting too random. Let's try to make a plausible guess based on the structure.\n\nAssuming the 3rd word is \"it\" (🐱=i, 🐦=t). But first guess had 🐦=t as False, so 🐦 can't be t. So 3rd word could be \"is\" (🐱=i, 🐦=s). Let's try:\n\n🐱=i, 🐦=s (so 3rd word is \"is\").\n\nThen, 4th word is 😱🤮 → if 🤮=n, then \"in\" (😱=i). But first guess had 😱=i as False, so 😱 can't be i. So 4th word could be \"on\" (😱=o, 🤮=n).\n\nSo 😱=o.\n\nThen, 2nd word: 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦 → s [🐶] [😍] e [😇] [🐵] o [😇] [🤠] e [🐸] s. Let's say it's \"s...e...oes\". Maybe \"stories\" (s-t-o-r-i-e-s) → but 7 letters. \"specifies\" (s-p-e-c-i-f-i-e-s) → 9 letters. \"speculators\" (s-p-e-c-u-l-a-t-o-r-s) → 11 letters. \"specifications\" (s-p-e-c-i-f-i-c-a-t-i-o-n-s) → 14 letters. Not 12.\n\nAlternatively, \"situations\" (s-i-t-u-a-t-i-o-n-s) → 11 letters. \"Stethoscopes\" (s-t-e-t-h-o-s-c-o-p-e-s) → 12 letters. Let's try:\n\ns (🐦=s) t (🐶=t) e (🤖=e) t (unknown) h (👽=h) o (😱=o) s (unknown) c (unknown) o (😱=o) p (😍=p) e (🤖=e) s (🐦=s). So 👽=h, 😍=p, 🐶=t, 😱=o, 🐸=p (but 😍=p and 🐸=p would be duplicate). No.\n\nLet's try to include the correct emojis and make a guess, even if it's not perfect. The answer must include all correct emojis from the history and the hint. So:\n\nCorrect emojis: 🤖=e, 🤮=n, 🐷=b, 🐻=g.\n\nWe need to include these and guess others. Let's make a guess:\n\n🤖=e, 🤮=n, 🐷=b, 🐻=g, 🐦=s, 😇=a, 👽=o, 🐶=t, 🐸=d, 🐱=i, 🐵=r, 🐧=c, 🦉=m, 🐨=k, 🐔=p, 🤓=l, 🥵=y, 🦆=w, 🦁=v, 🙄=q, 🤠=z, 😍=f.\n\nThis is a guess, even if not perfect. The answer should be in the format 'emoji=word' separated by commas, including all correct ones and the new guesses.\n\nTo solve this round, we analyze the encoded sentence, feedback from the first attempt, and common letter frequencies. The correct emojis from the first attempt are: `🤖=e`, `🤮=n`, `🐷=b`, and `🐻=g`. We need to include these and adjust incorrect guesses based on the feedback and sentence structure.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Frequent Emojis**: `🐦` appears 10 times (most frequent), suggesting a common letter like `s` (since `t` was incorrectly guessed).\n2. **Structure Clues**: The 3rd word `🐱🐦` (2 letters) might be \"is\" (common 2-letter word), so `🐱=i` and `🐦=s`.\n3. **Known Corrects**: `🤖=e` (given), `🤮=n` (ends many words), `🐷=b`, `🐻=g`.\n4. **Adjusting Guesses**: Previous incorrect guesses (e.g., `👽=h`, `🐶=a`) are replaced with common letters like `o` and `t`.\n\n### Final Guess:\nIncluding all correct emojis and adjusting for frequency\/structure:\n\nAnswer: 🤖=e, 🤮=n, 🐷=b, 🐻=g, 🐦=s, 😇=a, 👽=o, 🐶=t, 🐸=d, 🐱=i, 🐵=r, 🐧=c, 🦉=m, 🐨=k, 🐔=p, 🤓=l, 🥵=y, 🦆=w, 🦁=v, 🙄=q, 🤠=z, 😍=f","Okay, let's try to figure out the correct emojis. First, let's list out what we know from the history. \n\nFrom the first attempt, the feedback tells us that 🤖=e (correct), 🤮=n (correct), 🐷=b (correct), 🐻=g (correct). The rest were wrong. \n\nIn the second attempt, they added more guesses. The feedback here says: 🤖=e (still correct), 🤮=n (correct), 🐷=b (correct), 🐻=g (correct), 🐦=s (correct), 👽=o (correct), 🐱=i (correct). The others in that guess were wrong. So now we have confirmed:\n\n🤖=e\n🤮=n\n🐷=b\n🐻=g\n🐦=s\n👽=o\n🐱=i\n\nLet's check the encoded sentence with these known values. Let's substitute them:\n\nEncoded Sentence parts:\n\nFirst part: 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 → 🦆 o 🐧 e s\nSecond part: 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦 → s 🐶 😍 e 😇 🐵 😱 😇 🤠 e 🐸 s\nThird part: 🐱🐦 → i s\nFourth part: 😱🤮 → 😱 n\nFifth part: 😱🐶🐦🐸😇😱🐧🐱😱🤮 → 😱 🐶 s 🐸 😇 😱 🐧 i 😱 n\nSixth part: 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸 → s 🐶 😍 e 😇 🐵 😱 😇 🤠 e 🐸\nSeventh part: 🦆🐔😱🐱🤮 → 🦆 🐔 😱 i n\nEighth part: 👽🤓🤮🤖🥵 → o 🤓 n e 🥵\nNinth part: 🐷🐨 → b 🐨\nTenth part: 🤓🤖🐦🦉😱😇🐵🤖😇🐦 → 🤓 e s 🦉 😱 😇 🐵 e 😇 s\nParentheses part: (🦉👽😇🐵🤖😇🐧🐨 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 🐻😇👽🐶😍 🐷🤖🦉👽😇🤖 🐱🐸🐦 😱🦆🦁🐶🐱🐦🐱🐸🐱👽🤮 👽🤮 23 🤮👽🙄🤖🐵🐷🤖😇 2007)\n\nLet's look for words. The third part is \"i s\" which is \"is\"—so that's correct. So \"i s\" is \"is\", which fits with 🐱=i and 🐦=s.\n\nFourth part: 😱 n. If this is a word, maybe \"in\" if 😱=i, but wait, 🐱=i. Oh, but in attempt 1, they guessed 😱=i and it was wrong. So maybe \"an\"? Then 😱=a. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the second part: \"s 🐶 😍 e 😇 🐵 😱 😇 🤠 e 🐸 s\". The word starts and ends with s. Maybe \"s...e...e...s\" like \"sentences\"? Let's see. Let's think about the first part: \"🦆 o 🐧 e s\". Maybe \"words\" (if 🦆=w, 🐧=r: w o r e s? No. Maybe \"worlds\"? w o r l d s? No, length 5. The first part has 5 emojis, so 5 letters. \"words\" is 5 letters. If 🦆=w, 👽=o (already known), 🐧=r, 🤖=e, 🐦=s. Then \"w o r e s\"? No, \"words\" is w o r d s. Oh, \"words\" would be 5 letters. So maybe 🐧=d. Let's check. If 🦆=w, 👽=o, 🐧=d, 🤖=e, 🐦=s: \"w o d e s\"? No. Hmm.\n\nAnother part: the seventh part: \"🦆 🐔 😱 i n\". So \"w p 😱 i n\" (if 🦆=w, 🐔=p) → maybe \"wiping\"? But \"wiping\" is 6 letters. The part is 5 emojis: 🦆🐔😱🐱🤮 → 5 letters. So \"w p 😱 i n\" → 5 letters. Maybe \"whipn\"? No. Or \"wimpn\"? No. Maybe \"winin\"? No. Alternatively, if 🦆 is not w. Let's see. Maybe \"s o m e s\" (if first part is \"somes\")? No.\n\nLooking at the second attempt's feedback: in the second guess, they tried 🐦=s and it was correct. So 🐦=s. The third part is 🐱🐦 → i s → \"is\". That's correct.\n\nThe sixth part: \"s 🐶 😍 e 😇 🐵 😱 😇 🤠 e 🐸\". Let's count letters: 12 emojis → 12 letters. Maybe \"sentences...\"? Let's see, \"s a f e a r i a z e d\" (example). Not sure.\n\nThe parentheses part has \"23\" and \"2007\", which are numbers, so maybe not relevant. Let's look at the part \"🐻😇👽🐶😍\" → 🐻=g, 👽=o. So \"g 😇 o 🐶 😍\". Maybe \"go...\" like \"goldf\"? If 😇=l, 🐶=d, 😍=f: \"g l o d f\" → \"goldf\"? Maybe \"goldf\" part of \"goldfish\"? Not sure.\n\nThe ninth part is \"b 🐨\". Maybe \"bk\" (if 🐨=k), but \"bk\" is a possible abbreviation.\n\nThe eighth part: \"o 🤓 n e 🥵\". Let's see, 5 letters. Maybe \"onlyy\"? No. Or \"olney\"? Maybe \"only\" + something. \"only\" is o l n e y. Oh! o (👽=o), 🤓=l (if 🤓=l), n (🤮=n), e (🤖=e), 🥵=y. So \"o l n e y\" → \"only\". That would fit. So 👽=o, 🤓=l, 🤮=n, 🤖=e, 🥵=y. Then the eighth part would be \"only\". Let's check if that makes sense. If in attempt 2, they guessed 🤓=l and the feedback was False. Oh, the second attempt's feedback for 🤓 was False. So that guess was wrong. So maybe 🤓 is not l. Alternatively, \"oncey\"? No.\n\nAnother part: the tenth part: \"🤓 e s 🦉 😱 😇 🐵 e 😇 s\". Let's count letters: 10 emojis → 10 letters. Maybe \"clues...\". Let's think of \"letters\" → l e t t e r s. No.\n\nLooking at the fifth part: \"😱 🐶 s 🐸 😇 😱 🐧 i 😱 n\". Let's count letters: 11 emojis. Maybe \"i a s o a d i i n\" (example). Not helpful.\n\nLet's check the feedback from attempt 2. The correct ones there were: 🐦=s (correct), 👽=o (correct), 🐱=i (correct). So those are confirmed.\n\nSo known so far:\n🤖=e\n🤮=n\n🐷=b\n🐻=g\n🐦=s\n👽=o\n🐱=i\n\nWe need to find the others. Let's look for words with these letters.\n\nThe third part is \"i s\" → \"is\" → correct.\n\nThe fourth part is \"😱 n\" → two letters. Possible words: \"an\", \"in\", \"on\", \"en\", \"un\", \"rn\", etc. Since \"in\" would be 😱=i, but 🐱 is already i (correct), so 😱 can't be i. \"an\" would be 😱=a. \"on\" would be 😱=o, but 👽=o. \"en\" would be 😱=e, but 🤖=e. \"un\" could be 😱=u. Let's tentatively think 😱=a (so \"an\") or 😱=u (\"un\").\n\nThe seventh part: \"🦆 🐔 😱 i n\" → 5 letters. If 😱=a, then \"🦆 🐔 a i n\". Maybe \"pain\" plus a letter? \"w p a i n\" → \"wpain\"? No. \"spain\" → s p a i n. Oh! \"spain\" is 5 letters. s (🐦=s), but the first emoji is 🦆, so 🦆 would be s? But 🐦 is s. Each emoji is unique, so 🦆 can't be s. So \"spain\" would need 🦆=s, but 🐦=s, which is invalid. So that's not possible.\n\nAnother idea: \"point\" → p o i n t. But \"🦆 🐔 😱 i n\" would need to be 5 letters. Let's see: \"p o i n t\" is 5 letters. So if 🦆=p, 🐔=o (but 👽=o), so no. Maybe \"joint\" → j o i n t. 🦆=j, 🐔=o (no, 👽=o). Not helpful.\n\nThe first part: \"🦆 o 🐧 e s\" → 5 letters. Let's think of 5-letter words ending with \"es\". \"Hoses\" → h o s e s. But 👽=o, so \"h o s e s\" → 🦆=h, 🐧=s. But 🐦=s, so 🐧 can't be s. \"Loves\" → l o v e s. 🦆=l, 🐧=v. \"Loves\" is possible. Let's see. Then \"l o v e s\" → \"loves\". That could work. So maybe 🦆=l, 🐧=v.\n\nThe eighth part: \"o 🤓 n e 🥵\" → 5 letters. If \"only\" is o l n e y, then 🤓=l, 🥵=y. Let's check. So \"o l n e y\" → \"only\". If that's the case, then in attempt 2, they guessed 🤓=l and got feedback False. Oh, the second attempt's guess included 🤓=l and the feedback was False. So that's a problem. So maybe that's not correct.\n\nThe ninth part: \"b 🐨\" → 2 letters. \"bk\" (b k), \"bm\" (b m), \"bn\" (b n), \"bb\" (invalid, same letter), \"bp\" (b p), etc. If \"bk\", then 🐨=k. In attempt 1, they guessed 🐨=k and got feedback False. So that's not it. \"bm\" → 🐨=m.\n\nThe parentheses part: \"🦉 o 😇 🐵 e 😇 🐧 🐨\" → let's say it's a word. Maybe \"modelk\" (example). Not helpful.\n\nLooking at the second part: \"s 🐶 😍 e 😇 🐵 😱 😇 🤠 e 🐸 s\" → 12 letters. Ends with s. Maybe \"sentences...\" → s e n t e n c e s... No, length 12. \"statementses\"? No. \"sentiments\"? s e n t i m e n t s. That's 10 letters. Hmm.\n\nLet's check the feedback again. In attempt 1, they guessed 🐦=t (False), so 🐦 is not t. Attempt 2 guessed 🐦=s (True), so that's correct. \n\nAttempt 2 also guessed 😇=a (False), 👽=o (True), 🐶=t (False), 🐸=d (False), 🐱=i (True), 🐵=r (False), 🐧=c (False), 🦉=m (False), 🐨=k (False), 🐔=p (False), 🤓=l (False), 🥵=y (False), 🦆=w (False), 🦁=v (False), 🙄=q (False), 🤠=z (False), 😍=f (False).\n\nSo in attempt 2, the correct ones were 🐦=s, 👽=o, 🐱=i. So we can confirm those.\n\nLet's think about the fifth part: \"😱 🐶 s 🐸 😇 😱 🐧 i 😱 n\" → Let's assume some letters. Suppose 😱=a. Then \"a 🐶 s 🐸 😇 a 🐧 i a n\". Maybe \"a t s o a c i a n\" → \"atsocian\"? Not a word. Maybe \"a d s o m a d i a n\" → \"adsomadian\"? No.\n\nThe sixth part: \"s 🐶 😍 e 😇 🐵 😱 😇 🤠 e 🐸\" → 11 letters. If \"s t f e a r i a z e d\" → \"stfeariazed\"? No.\n\nAnother angle: The hint says that the most frequent emoji is 🤖=e. Let's check the frequency of each emoji in the encoded sentence. Let's count:\n\nEmojis in the sentence:\n🦆,👽,🐧,🤖,🐦, \n🐦,🐶,😍,🤖,😇,🐵,😱,😇,🤠,🤖,🐸,🐦, \n🐱,🐦, \n😱,🤮, \n😱,🐶,🐦,🐸,😇,😱,🐧,🐱,😱,🤮, \n🐦,🐶,😍,🤖,😇,🐵,😱,😇,🤠,🤖,🐸, \n🦆,🐔,😱,🐱,🤮, \n👽,🤓,🤮,🤖,🥵, \n🐷,🐨, \n🤓,🤖,🐦,🦉,😱,😇,🐵,🤖,😇,🐦, \n(🦉,👽,😇,🐵,🤖,😇,🐧,🐨, \n🦆,👽,🐧,🤖,🐦, \n🐻,😇,👽,🐶,😍, \n🐷,🤖,🦉,👽,😇,🤖, \n🐱,🐸,🐦, \n😱,🦆,🦁,🐶,🐱,🐦,🐱,🐸,🐱,👽,🤮, \n👽,🤮, \n23, \n🤮,👽,🙄,🤖,🐵,🐷,🤖,😇, \n2007)\n\nLet's count occurrences (excluding numbers):\n\n🤖: Let's count. First part:1. Second part:3 (positions 4, 10, 15). Sixth part:2 (positions 4, 10). Eighth part:1. Tenth part:2 (positions 2, 8). Parentheses part: 2 (positions 5, 6). Total: 1+3+2+1+2+2=11? Let me recount:\n\nFirst sentence: 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 → 1.\nSecond: 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦 → 2 (positions 4 and 10).\nThird: 🐱🐦 → 0.\nFourth: 😱🤮 → 0.\nFifth: 😱🐶🐦🐸😇😱🐧🐱😱🤮 → 0.\nSixth: 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸 → 2 (positions 4 and 10).\nSeventh: 🦆🐔😱🐱🤮 →0.\nEighth: 👽🤓🤮🤖🥵 →1.\nNinth: 🐷🐨 →0.\nTenth: 🤓🤖🐦🦉😱😇🐵🤖😇🐦 →2 (positions 2 and 8).\nParentheses:\n(🦉👽😇🐵🤖😇🐧🐨 →1 (position 5).\n🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 →1 (position 4).\n🐻😇👽🐶😍 →0.\n🐷🤖🦉👽😇🤖 →2 (positions 2 and 6).\n🐱🐸🐦 →0.\n😱🦆🦁🐶🐱🐦🐱🐸🐱👽🤮 →0.\n👽🤮 →0.\n23 →0.\n🤮👽🙄🤖🐵🐷🤖😇 →2 (positions 4 and 6).\n2007 →0)\nSo total 🤖: 1 (first) +2 (second) +2 (sixth) +1 (eighth) +2 (tenth) +1 (parentheses1) +1 (parentheses2) +2 (parentheses4) +2 (parentheses7) → 1+2=3; +2=5; +1=6; +2=8; +1=9; +1=10; +2=12; +2=14. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The hint says that the most frequent emoji is 🤖, which is given as e, so that's correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the word \"the\" which is common. The second attempt's feedback says 👽=o is correct, so 👽=o. So \"the\" would need t, h, e. But we have 🤖=e. So maybe \"the\" is represented by some emojis. Let's see if there's a 3-letter word with e. \n\nLooking at the fourth part: 😱🤮 → 😱n. If 😱=t, then \"tn\" which doesn't make sense. If 😱=h, then \"hn\" → \"hn\" not a word. If 😱=a, \"an\". If 😱=i, \"in\" but 🐱=i.\n\nAnother common word: \"and\" → a, n, d. We have 🤮=n, so maybe \"and\" is 😇=a, 🐧=d, and something else. Let's see. The first part: 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 → 🦆 o 🐧 e s. If \"words\" (w o r d s), but then 🐧=d. So \"w o d e s\" → \"wodes\"? No. \"worlds\" → w o r l d s. But that's 6 letters. The first part has 5 letters. So 5 letters. \"Hoses\" → h o s e s. But 🐦=s, so \"h o s e s\" → 🦆=h, 👽=o, 🐧=s (but 🐦=s, duplicate). No.\n\nThe seventh part: 🦆🐔😱🐱🤮 → 5 letters. \"w p h i n\" (if 🦆=w, 🐔=p, 😱=h, 🐱=i, 🤮=n) → \"wphin\"? No. \"whipn\"? No. \"winch\"? w i n c h. But that's 5 letters. \"w i n c h\" → 🦆=w, 🐱=i, 🤮=n, so need 😱=c, 🐔=h. Then \"w h c i n\" → no.\n\nLet's try to look at the second part again: \"s 🐶 😍 e 😇 🐵 😱 😇 🤠 e 🐸 s\" → 12 letters. The word starts and ends with s. Maybe \"sentences\" (s e n t e n c e s) but that's 9 letters. No. \"statements\" (s t a t e m e n t s) → 10 letters. \"sentiments\" (s e n t i m e n t s) → 10 letters. \"situations\" (s i t u a t i o n s) → 11 letters. Hmm.\n\nThe tenth part: \"🤓 e s 🦉 😱 😇 🐵 e 😇 s\" → 10 letters. Maybe \"letters...\" (l e t t e r s...). Let's see. \"l e t t e r s\" is 7 letters. If it's \"lettersx\" (but 10 letters). \"clues...\" (c l u e s...). No.\n\nLet's check the feedback for attempt 2 again. They guessed 😇=a (False), so 😇 is not a. They guessed 🐶=t (False), so 🐶 is not t. They guessed 🐸=d (False), 🐵=r (False), 🐧=c (False), 🦉=m (False), 🐨=k (False), 🐔=p (False), 🤓=l (False), 🥵=y (False), 🦆=w (False), 🦁=v (False), 🙄=q (False), 🤠=z (False), 😍=f (False).\n\nSo we need to guess new values. Let's list the confirmed emojis:\n\n🤖=e\n🤮=n\n🐷=b\n🐻=g\n🐦=s\n👽=o\n🐱=i\n\nNow, the required format is to include all the correct ones from the hint and history, and guess others. So the answer must include these confirmed ones, plus new guesses.\n\nLet's try to guess some others. Let's look at the third part: \"i s\" → \"is\" (correct). The fourth part: \"😱 n\". Let's guess 😱=a (so \"an\"). \n\nThe seventh part: \"🦆 🐔 a i n\" → 5 letters. Maybe \"paint\" → p a i n t. So if 🦆=p, 🐔=a (but 😱=a, duplicate), no. \"spain\" → s p a i n, but 🦆 would be s, but 🐦=s. \"chain\" → c h a i n. So 🦆=c, 🐔=h. Then \"c h a i n\" → \"chain\". That's a possible word. So let's try 🦆=c, 🐔=h.\n\nThe eighth part: \"o 🤓 n e 🥵\" → 5 letters. \"oncey\"? No. \"onion\" → o n i o n. No, but we have o (👽=o), n (🤮=n), i (🐱=i). \"onion\" would need 🤓=n (duplicate), no. \"only\" → o l n e y. So if 🤓=l, 🥵=y. Even though attempt 2 guessed 🤓=l and got False, maybe that was a mistake. Let's try that.\n\nThe ninth part: \"b 🐨\" → 2 letters. \"bk\" (b k), but attempt 1 guessed 🐨=k and got False. \"bm\" (b m), \"bn\" (b n), \"bp\" (b p), \"bq\" (b q), \"br\" (b r), \"bs\" (b s, but 🐦=s), \"bt\" (b t), \"bu\" (b u), \"bv\" (b v), \"bw\" (b w), \"bx\" (b x), \"by\" (b y), \"bz\" (b z). Let's guess 🐨=r (so \"br\").\n\nThe tenth part: \"🤓 e s 🦉 a 😇 🐵 e 😇 s\" → if 🤓=l, then \"l e s 🦉 a 😇 🐵 e 😇 s\". Maybe \"les...\". \"lesson\" → l e s s o n. But \"les\" plus more.\n\nThe first part: \"c o 🐧 e s\" → 5 letters. \"c o v e s\" (coves) → c o v e s. So if 🐧=v, then \"coves\". That works. So 🐧=v.\n\nThe second part: \"s 🐶 😍 e 😇 🐵 a 😇 🤠 e 🐸 s\". Let's say \"s t f e m r a m z e d s\" → not helpful. Let's try \"s t a e m r a m z e d s\" → no.\n\nThe sixth part: \"s 🐶 😍 e 😇 🐵 a 😇 🤠 e 🐸\" → 11 letters. Maybe \"s t a e m r a m z e d\" → \"stae...\".\n\nThe parentheses part: \"🦉 o 😇 🐵 e 😇 v r\" → if 🦉=m, then \"m o 😇 🐵 e 😇 v r\". Maybe \"model vr\"? Not helpful.\n\nLet's make some guesses based on these possibilities:\n\nConfirmed:\n🤖=e, 🤮=n, 🐷=b, 🐻=g, 🐦=s, 👽=o, 🐱=i\n\nGuesses:\n😱=a (so \"an\"), \n🦆=c (so first part \"coves\" if 🐧=v), \n🐧=v (so first part \"coves\"), \n🐔=h (so seventh part \"chain\"), \n🤓=l (so eighth part \"only\"), \n🥵=y (so eighth part \"only\"), \n🐨=r (so ninth part \"br\"), \n😇=m (so some parts), \n🐶=t (attempt 2 guessed t and got False, but maybe try again?), \n🐸=d, \n🐵=r (attempt 2 guessed r and got False, maybe not), \n🦉=m (attempt 2 guessed m and got False), \n😍=f (attempt 2 guessed f and got False), \n🤠=z (attempt 1 guessed z and got False), \n🦁=v (attempt 1 guessed v and got False), \n🙄=q (attempt 1 guessed q and got False).\n\nBut since we need to make a guess, let's pick some. Let's say:\n\n😱=a, \n🦆=c, \n🐧=v, \n🐔=h, \n🤓=l, \n🥵=y, \n🐨=r, \n😇=m, \n🐶=t, \n🐸=d, \n🐵=r, \n🦉=m, \n😍=f, \n🤠=z, \n🦁=v, \n🙄=q.\n\nBut need to ensure uniqueness. Let's list all emojis and their current guesses:\n\n🤖=e, \n🤮=n, \n🐷=b, \n🐻=g, \n🐦=s, \n👽=o, \n🐱=i, \n😱=a, \n🦆=c, \n🐧=v, \n🐔=h, \n🤓=l, \n🥵=y, \n🐨=r, \n😇=m, \n🐶=t, \n🐸=d, \n🐵=r (duplicate with 🐨=r? Oh, no, 🐨=r and 🐵=r would be duplicate. So change 🐵=k. \n\nWait, 🐨 was guessed as k in attempt 1 and got False, so maybe 🐨=r. Let's adjust:\n\n🐵=k, \n🦉=p, \n😍=f, \n🤠=z, \n🦁=v, \n🙄=q.\n\nSo final guess would include all confirmed and these new ones.\n\nTo solve this Crypto Word Game, we analyze the provided encoded sentence, feedback from previous attempts, and the confirmed hints. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Confirmed from Feedback:\n- **🤖=e** (given hint and confirmed in both attempts)\n- **🤮=n** (confirmed in both attempts)\n- **🐷=b** (confirmed in both attempts)\n- **🐻=g** (confirmed in both attempts)\n- **🐦=s** (confirmed in attempt 2)\n- **👽=o** (confirmed in attempt 2)\n- **🐱=i** (confirmed in attempt 2)\n\n### Deductions and Guesses:\n1. **😱**: The fourth part of the encoded sentence is \"😱🤮\", which translates to \"😱n\". Common 2-letter words ending with \"n\" include \"an\". Assuming \"an\" fits, we guess **😱=a**.\n2. **🦆**: The first part is \"🦆👽🐧🤖🐦\" → \"🦆 o 🐧 e s\". A 5-letter word ending with \"es\" could be \"coves\" (c o v e s). Thus, **🦆=c**.\n3. **🐧**: Following \"coves\" (c o v e s), **🐧=v**.\n4. **🐔**: The seventh part is \"🦆🐔😱🐱🤮\" → \"c 🐔 a i n\". A 5-letter word here could be \"chain\" (c h a i n), so **🐔=h**.\n5. **🤓**: The eighth part is \"👽🤓🤮🤖🥵\" → \"o 🤓 n e 🥵\". A common 5-letter word is \"only\" (o l n e y), so **🤓=l**.\n6. **🥵**: Following \"only\", **🥵=y**.\n7. **🐨**: The ninth part is \"🐷🐨\" → \"b 🐨\". A 2-letter combination could be \"br\", so **🐨=r**.\n8. **😇**: The second part includes \"🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦\" → \"s 🐶 😍 e 😇 🐵 a 😇 🤠 e 🐸 s\". Assuming \"s t f e m k a m z e d s\" (filler for context), we guess **😇=m**.\n9. **🐶**: Common words starting with \"s\" (🐦=s) might involve \"t\" (e.g., \"sentence\"), so **🐶=t**.\n10. **🐸**: The second part ends with \"🐸🐦\" → \"🐸 s\". A common ending could be \"ds\" (e.g., \"sentences\"), so **🐸=d**.\n11. **🐵**: The second part includes \"😇🐵\" → \"m 🐵\". A possible letter is \"k\" (e.g., \"mark\"), so **🐵=k**.\n12. **🦉**: The tenth part is \"🤓🤖🐦🦉😱😇🐵🤖😇🐦\" → \"l e s 🦉 a m k e m s\". A possible letter is \"p\" (e.g., \"lesp...\"), so **🦉=p**.\n13. **😍**: The second part includes \"🐶😍\" → \"t 😍\". A common letter is \"f\" (e.g., \"testf...\"), so **😍=f**.\n14. **🤠**: The second part includes \"🤠🤖\" → \"🤠 e\". A less common letter is \"z\", so **🤠=z**.\n15. **🦁**: The parentheses part includes \"🦁🐶\" → \"🦁 t\". A possible letter is \"v\", so **🦁=v**.\n16. **🙄**: The parentheses part includes \"🙄🤖\" → \"🙄 e\". A less common letter is \"q\", so **🙄=q**.\n\nAnswer: 🤖=e,🤮=n,🐷=b,🐻=g,🐦=s,👽=o,🐱=i,😱=a,🦆=c,🐧=v,🐔=h,🤓=l,🥵=y,🐨=r,😇=m,🐶=t,🐸=d,🐵=k,🦉=p,😍=f,🤠=z,🦁=v,🙄=q","Okay, let's try to figure out the current guess. First, let's list out all the emojis and their confirmed correct mappings from the history.\n\nFrom the feedback:\n\n- Correct in all attempts: 🤖=e (given as hint), 🤮=n, 🐷=b, 🐻=g, 🐦=s (attempt 2 feedback said 🐦: True), 👽=o (attempt 2 feedback 👽: True), 🐱=i (attempt 2 feedback 🐱: True), 😱=a (attempt 3 feedback 😱: True), 🦆=c (attempt 3 feedback 🦆: True), 🐔=h (attempt 3 feedback 🐔: True).\n\nSo the confirmed mappings so far are:\n🤖=e, 🤮=n, 🐷=b, 🐻=g, 🐦=s, 👽=o, 🐱=i, 😱=a, 🦆=c, 🐔=h.\n\nNow let's look at the encoded sentence and substitute the known emojis. Let's break down the sentence:\n\nEncoded Sentence: 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦 🐱🐦 😱🤮 😱🐶🐦🐸😇😱🐧🐱😱🤮 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸 🦆🐔😱🐱🤮 👽🤓🤮🤖🥵 🐷🐨 🤓🤖🐦🦉😱😇🐵🤖😇🐦 (🦉👽😇🐵🤖😇🐧🐨 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 🐻😇👽🐶😍 🐷🤖🦉👽😇🤖 🐱🐸🐦 😱🦆🦁🐶🐱🐦🐱🐸🐱👽🤮 👽🤮 23 🤮👽🙄🤖🐵🐷🤖😇 2007).\n\nSubstituting known emojis:\n\nFirst part: 🦆=c, 👽=o, 🤖=e, 🐦=s. So first word: c o 🐧 e s → \"co?es\". Maybe \"cooes\" (but 🐧 is unknown), but let's check other parts.\n\nSecond word: 🐦=s, 🐶=?, 😍=?, 🤖=e, 😇=?, 🐵=?, 😱=a, 😇=?, 🤠=?, 🤖=e, 🐸=?, 🐦=s → s ? ? e ? ? a ? ? e ? s.\n\nThird word: 🐱=i, 🐦=s → \"is\".\n\nFourth word: 😱=a, 🤮=n → \"an\".\n\nFifth word: 😱=a, 🐶=?, 🐦=s, 🐸=?, 😇=?, 😱=a, 🐧=?, 🐱=i, 😱=a, 🤮=n → a ? s ? ? a ? i a n.\n\nSixth word: same as the second word (since it's the same sequence of emojis): s ? ? e ? ? a ? ? e ? s.\n\nSeventh word: 🦆=c, 🐔=h, 😱=a, 🐱=i, 🤮=n → \"chain\".\n\nEighth word: 👽=o, 🤓=?, 🤮=n, 🤖=e, 🥵=? → o ? n e ?.\n\nNinth word: 🐷=b, 🐨=? → \"b?\".\n\nTenth word: 🤓=?, 🤖=e, 🐦=s, 🦉=?, 😱=a, 😇=?, 🐵=?, 🤖=e, 😇=?, 🐦=s → ? e s ? a ? ? e ? s.\n\nParentheses part:\n\nFirst: 🦉=?, 👽=o, 😇=?, 🐵=?, 🤖=e, 😇=?, 🐧=?, 🐨=? → ? o ? ? e ? ? ?.\n\nSecond: 🦆=c, 👽=o, 🐧=?, 🤖=e, 🐦=s → c o ? e s (same as the first word).\n\nThird: 🐻=g, 😇=?, 👽=o, 🐶=?, 😍=? → g ? o ? ?.\n\nFourth: 🐷=b, 🤖=e, 🦉=?, 👽=o, 😇=?, 🤖=e → b e ? o ? e.\n\nFifth: 🐱=i, 🐸=?, 🐦=s → i ? s.\n\nSixth: 😱=a, 🦆=c, 🦁=?, 🐶=?, 🐱=i, 🐦=s, 🐱=i, 🐸=?, 🐱=i, 👽=o, 🤮=n → a c ? ? i s i ? i o n.\n\nThen: 👽=o, 🤮=n → \"on\".\n\nThen 23, then: 🤮=n, 👽=o, 🙄=?, 🤖=e, 🐵=?, 🐷=b, 🤖=e, 😇=? → n o ? e ? b e ?.\n\nThen 2007.\n\nLooking at the seventh word: \"chain\" (c h a i n) matches the substitution (🦆=c, 🐔=h, 😱=a, 🐱=i, 🤮=n). That's correct, so that's a good check.\n\nThird word is \"is\" (🐱=i, 🐦=s) which makes sense. Fourth word is \"an\" (😱=a, 🤮=n) which is correct. So those are solid.\n\nThe first word is \"co?es\". Let's think of 5-letter words starting with \"co\" and ending with \"es\". Maybe \"coats\" (but \"t\" would be the missing letter, but 🐧 is the emoji here. Let's check if that fits elsewhere.\n\nLooking at the fifth word: a ? s ? ? a ? i a n. Let's break it down: a (😱=a) + [🐶] + s (🐦=s) + [🐸] + [😇] + a (😱=a) + [🐧] + i (🐱=i) + a (😱=a) + n (🤮=n). So the structure is a X s Y Z a W i a n. Let's think of possible words here. Maybe \"a ... s ... a ... ian\" (like \"a ... s ... a ... ian\").\n\nThe second and sixth words are the same: s ? ? e ? ? a ? ? e ? s. Let's think of a word that starts with \"s\", ends with \"s\", and has \"e\" in the middle. For example, \"sentences\" (but length? Let's count the emojis: 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦 → 12 emojis. So 12 letters. \"s?????????es\"? 12 letters. Maybe \"s?????????es\". Let's count letters: 1=s, 2=🐶, 3=😍, 4=e (🤖=e), 5=😇, 6=🐵, 7=a (😱=a), 8=😇, 9=🤠, 10=e (🤖=e), 11=🐸, 12=s (🐦=s). So positions: 1=s,4=e,7=a,10=e,12=s. So s _ _ e _ _ a _ _ e _ s. 12 letters. Let's think of 12-letter words with that pattern. Maybe \"sacrifices\"? Let's check: s a c r i f i c e s → but length is 10. Hmm. Maybe \"subsequences\"? s u b s e q u e n c e s → 12 letters. Let's check: s (1), u (2), b (3), s (4=e? No, 4 is e). So 4=e. So 4th letter is e. \"subsequences\" 4th letter is 's' (s u b s ...), no. Maybe \"sentences\" is 9 letters. Not enough. Let's think again.\n\nLooking at the seventh word is \"chain\" (correct), which is 5 letters. The eighth word: 👽=o, 🤓=?, 🤮=n, 🤖=e, 🥵=? → o ? n e ?. Maybe \"ounce\" (o u n c e). So if 🤓=u, 🥵=c? But 5 letters. \"ounce\" is 5 letters. Let's check: o (👽=o) + u (🤓=u) + n (🤮=n) + e (🤖=e) + c (🥵=c). That would be \"ounce\". That's possible.\n\nThe ninth word: 🐷=b, 🐨=? → \"b?\". Maybe \"by\" (b y) if 🐨=y. But let's check other parts.\n\nThe tenth word: 🤓=?, 🤖=e, 🐦=s, 🦉=?, 😱=a, 😇=?, 🐵=?, 🤖=e, 😇=?, 🐦=s → ? e s ? a ? ? e ? s. Let's say 🤓=u (from the eighth word \"ounce\"), then \"u e s ...\". Maybe \"uses...\" but let's see. \"u e s X a Y Z e W s\".\n\nIn the parentheses part, the fifth word: 🐱=i, 🐸=?, 🐦=s → \"i ? s\". Could be \"its\" (i t s) if 🐸=t. Let's check that. If 🐸=t, then \"its\".\n\nLooking back at the second word's 11th emoji: 🐸=t → 11th letter is t. So the second word structure: s _ _ e _ _ a _ _ e t s. 12 letters. Let's see: s _ _ e _ _ a _ _ e t s. Maybe \"scientists\"? s c i e n t i s t s → 10 letters. No. Or \"secretaries\"? s e c r e t a r i e s → 12 letters. Let's check: s (1), e (2), c (3), r (4=e? No, 4=e). 4th letter is e. So 4th is e. \"secretaries\": positions 1=s, 2=e, 3=c, 4=r (no, 4 needs to be e). So 4th letter e. Let's try \"s...e...a...e t s\".\n\nIf the fifth word in the main sentence: a ? s ? ? a ? i a n. Let's assume 🐸=t (from \"its\" in parentheses), then the fifth word's 4th emoji is 🐸=t → a X s t Z a W i a n. So \"a X s t Z a W i a n\". Maybe \"a t s t...\" No. Let's think of another angle.\n\nFrom attempt 3, feedback for 😇 was False. So 😇 is not m. Attempt 2, 😇 was False (not a). Attempt 1, 😇 was False (not s). So 😇 is another letter. Let's think of common letters. Let's look at the word \"is\" (third word) and \"an\" (fourth), which are common.\n\nThe seventh word is \"chain\" (correct). Let's check the sixth word (same as second): s ? ? e ? ? a ? ? e ? s. Let's suppose 😍=f (from attempt 2, but feedback was False, so maybe not). Alternatively, let's look at the third attempt's guess where 😍 was not in the feedback, so it's still unknown.\n\nLooking at the parentheses part, third word: 🐻=g, 😇=?, 👽=o, 🐶=?, 😍=? → \"g ? o ? ?\". Maybe \"gives\" (g i v e s), but 👽=o, so \"g ? o ? ?\" → 5 letters. \"glove\"? g l o v e. That would be 5 letters. So g (🐻=g) + l (😇=l) + o (👽=o) + v (🐶=v) + e (😍=e). But 🤖=e, so maybe not. Alternatively, \"grace\": g r a c e. But 😱=a, so \"g r a c e\" → g (g) + r (😇=r) + a (a) + c (🐶=c) + e (😍=e). But that's possible. Let's check: \"grace\" → 5 letters. So if 😇=r, 🐶=c, 😍=e. But 🤖=e, so maybe 😍 is a different letter.\n\nAlternatively, \"group\": g r o u p. So 😇=r, 🐶=u, 😍=p. Then \"group\" (g r o u p). That could fit. So \"g r o u p\" → 🐻=g, 😇=r, 👽=o, 🐶=u, 😍=p. Let's check if that works elsewhere.\n\nIf 🐶=u, then the second word's second emoji is 🐶=u → s u ? e ? ? a ? ? e ? s. So \"s u _ e ...\". Maybe \"surname...\" but 12 letters. Let's check the fifth word in the main sentence: a 🐶=u, so a u s ... → \"a u s ...\".\n\nThe fifth word: 😱=a, 🐶=u, 🐦=s, 🐸=?, 😇=?, 😱=a, 🐧=?, 🐱=i, 😱=a, 🤮=n → a u s X Y a W i a n. Maybe \"auspicious an\"? No. \"aus...a...ian\"? Maybe \"auspician\" (but not a word). Alternatively, \"austrian\" → a u s t r i a n. Let's count letters: a u s t r i a n → 8 letters. But the fifth word's emojis are: 😱🐶🐦🐸😇😱🐧🐱😱🤮 → 10 emojis. So 10 letters. \"a u s t r a ... i a n\". Let's see: a (1), u (2), s (3), t (4=🐸=t), r (5=😇=r), a (6=😱=a), ... (7=🐧=?), i (8=🐱=i), a (9=😱=a), n (10=🤮=n). So 7th letter would be the missing one. \"austri...\" → \"austrian\" is 8 letters, but here it's 10 letters. Maybe \"austrian...\" No. Let's think of \"austereian\"? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the first word: 🦆=c, 👽=o, 🐧=?, 🤖=e, 🐦=s → \"co?es\". If 🐧=w, then \"cowes\" (a place). But maybe \"coats\" (c o a t s) if 🐧=a. But 😱=a, so maybe not. Or \"comets\" (c o m e s) if 🐧=m. Let's check if 🐧=m. Then the first word is \"comets\". Let's check if that fits elsewhere.\n\nThe parentheses part's first word: 🦉👽😇🐵🤖😇🐧🐨 → 🦉=?, 👽=o, 😇=?, 🐵=?, 🤖=e, 😇=?, 🐧=m, 🐨=? → ? o ? ? e ? m ?. Maybe \"promenade\"? Not sure. Let's see.\n\nThe tenth word in the main sentence: 🤓🤖🐦🦉😱😇🐵🤖😇🐦 → 🤓=?, e, s, 🦉=?, a, 😇=?, 🐵=?, e, 😇=?, s → ? e s ? a ? ? e ? s. If 🤓=r, then \"r e s ...\". Maybe \"residents\"? r e s i d e n t s → 9 letters. Let's check: r (🤓=r), e (🤖=e), s (🐦=s), i (🦉=i), a (😱=a), d (😇=d), t (🐵=t), e (🤖=e), d (😇=d), s (🐦=s) → \"residents\" (r e s i d e n t s) → 9 letters, but the emoji sequence is 10 emojis. So 10 letters. Maybe \"residences\" → r e s i d e n c e s → 10 letters. Let's check: r (🤓=r), e (e), s (s), i (🦉=i), a (a), d (😇=d), n (🐵=n), e (e), c (😇=c), s (s). Hmm, but 😇 would have to be both d and c, which is impossible. So maybe 😇 is a different letter.\n\nLet's look at the feedback from previous attempts. In attempt 3, the guesses included 😇=m (feedback: False), so 😇≠m. Attempt 2: 😇=a (False). Attempt 1: 😇=s (False). So 😇 is not a, s, m. Let's think of common letters like t, d, h, l, etc.\n\nThe second word's structure: s _ _ e _ _ a _ _ e _ s. Let's count the letters again. Emojis: 🐦(s) 🐶 🍋 😇 🐵 😱(a) 😇 🤠 🤖(e) 🐸 🐦(s). So 12 letters: positions 1=s, 4=e (🤖=e?), wait no: the emojis are 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦. Let's list each position with emojis:\n\n1: 🐦=s\n\n2: 🐶=?\n\n3: 😍=?\n\n4: 🤖=e\n\n5: 😇=?\n\n6: 🐵=?\n\n7: 😱=a\n\n8: 😇=?\n\n9: 🤠=?\n\n10: 🤖=e\n\n11: 🐸=?\n\n12: 🐦=s\n\nSo the word is s (1) [2] [3] e (4) [5] [6] a (7) [8] [9] e (10) [11] s (12). So 12 letters: s _ _ e _ _ a _ _ e _ s.\n\nLet's think of 12-letter words with this pattern. Maybe \"subsequences\"? s u b s e q u e n c e s → 12 letters. Let's check:\n\n1: s (matches)\n\n2: u (🐶=u)\n\n3: b (😍=b)\n\n4: s (but 4 is e, so no. 4th position in the word is 's' in subsequences, but 4th emoji is 🤖=e, so 4th letter must be e. So that's a mismatch.)\n\nAnother option: \"sentences\" is 9 letters. Not enough. Maybe \"sacrileges\"? s a c r i l e g e s → 10 letters. No. Let's think of \"s...e...a...e...s\". Maybe \"sceptres\" (too short). Alternatively, \"sciences\" is 8 letters.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the seventh word: \"chain\" (correct), which is 5 letters. The eighth word: 👽=o, 🤓=?, 🤮=n, 🤖=e, 🥵=? → o ? n e ?. Let's say \"ounce\" (o u n c e) → 🤓=u, 🥵=c. Then the eighth word is \"ounce\".\n\nThe ninth word: 🐷=b, 🐨=? → \"b?\". If \"by\" (b y), then 🐨=y. Let's check if that works elsewhere.\n\nThe tenth word: 🤓=u, 🤖=e, 🐦=s, 🦉=?, 😱=a, 😇=?, 🐵=?, 🤖=e, 😇=?, 🐦=s → u e s ? a ? ? e ? s. Maybe \"uses...\" but \"ues...\" → \"ues\" isn't a start. Maybe \"uessel...\" No.\n\nThe parentheses part, fourth word: 🐷=b, 🤖=e, 🦉=?, 👽=o, 😇=?, 🤖=e → b e ? o ? e. Maybe \"before\" (b e f o r e). So 🦉=f, 😇=r. Let's check that. If 😇=r, then:\n\nFourth word: b e f o r e → \"before\" (matches: b=🐷, e=🤖, f=🦉, o=👽, r=😇, e=🤖). That works! So 🦉=f, 😇=r.\n\nLet's test 😇=r. Then:\n\nThe second word's 5th and 8th emojis are 😇=r. So the second word:\n\n1: s (🐦=s)\n\n2: 🐶=?\n\n3: 😍=?\n\n4: e (🤖=e)\n\n5: r (😇=r)\n\n6: 🐵=?\n\n7: a (😱=a)\n\n8: r (😇=r)\n\n9: 🤠=?\n\n10: e (🤖=e)\n\n11: 🐸=?\n\n12: s (🐦=s)\n\nSo the word becomes s [2] [3] e r [6] a r [9] e [11] s. Let's think of a 12-letter word here. Maybe \"secretaries\"? s e c r e t a r i e s → 12 letters. Let's check:\n\ns (1), e (2), c (3), r (4=e? No, 4 is e. 4th letter in \"secretaries\" is 'r' (s e c r ...), but 4th position here is e. So 4th letter must be e.\n\nAnother option: \"secondaryes\"? No. Let's think of \"s...e r ... a r ... e ... s\".\n\nThe fifth word in the main sentence: 😱=a, 🐶=?, 🐦=s, 🐸=?, 😇=r, 😱=a, 🐧=?, 🐱=i, 😱=a, 🤮=n → a [2] s [11] r a [7] i a n. Let's say 🐶=c (so [2]=c), then a c s ... r a ... i a n. Maybe \"acrylician\"? Not a word. Alternatively, if 🐶=t, then a t s ... r a ... i a n. \"australian\" → a u s t r a l i a n. Let's check:\n\na u s t r a l i a n → 10 letters. Let's map to the emojis:\n\n😱=a (1), 🐶=u (2), 🐦=s (3), 🐸=t (4), 😇=r (5), 😱=a (6), 🐧=l (7), 🐱=i (8), 😱=a (9), 🤮=n (10). That's \"australian\" (a u s t r a l i a n). Perfect! So that fits. So:\n\n🐶=u (position 2: u)\n\n🐸=t (position 4: t)\n\n🐧=l (position 7: l)\n\nThen the fifth word is \"australian\". That makes sense.\n\nLet's check the first word: 🦆=c, 👽=o, 🐧=l, 🤖=e, 🐦=s → \"coles\". \"Coles\" is a possible word (maybe a name or brand). That works.\n\nThe second word (and sixth word) would then be:\n\ns (1), u (🐶=u, position 2), [3]=?, e (4), r (😇=r, 5), [6]=?, a (7), r (8), [9]=?, e (10), t (🐸=t, 11), s (12). So s u [3] e r [6] a r [9] e t s. Let's see. If [3]=p (😍=p), [6]=k (🐵=k), [9]=d (🤠=d), then \"superskydets\"? No. Let's think of \"supermarket\"? No, length. Let's think of \"surgeryets\"? No. Alternatively, maybe the word is \"surveillance\" (12 letters). Let's check: s u r v e i l l a n c e → 12 letters. No, but the structure here is s u [3] e r [6] a r [9] e t s. Let's try \"surveillance\": s u r v e i l l a n c e. No, not matching. Alternatively, \"surcharges\" → s u r c h a r g e s → 10 letters. No. Let's think of \"surpasses\" → s u r p a s s e s → 9 letters. No.\n\nAlternatively, let's check the sixth word (same as the second) is the same as the second word. Let's think of \"s u p e r m a r k e t s\" → but that's 12 letters: s u p e r m a r k e t s. Let's check:\n\n1: s\n\n2: u (🐶=u)\n\n3: p (😍=p)\n\n4: e (🤖=e)\n\n5: r (😇=r)\n\n6: m (🐵=m)\n\n7: a (😱=a)\n\n8: r (😇=r)\n\n9: k (🤠=k)\n\n10: e (🤖=e)\n\n11: t (🐸=t)\n\n12: s (🐦=s)\n\nSo the word would be \"supermarket s\"? No, \"supermarkets\" is 11 letters. Wait, \"supermarkets\" is s u p e r m a r k e t s → 12 letters. Yes! Let's count: s (1), u (2), p (3), e (4), r (5), m (6), a (7), r (8), k (9), e (10), t (11), s (12). Perfect! That's 12 letters. So \"supermarkets\".\n\nSo:\n\n😍=p (position 3: p)\n\n🐵=m (position 6: m)\n\n🤠=k (position 9: k)\n\nThat fits. Let's verify:\n\nSecond word: 🐦(s) 🐶(u) 😍(p) 🤖(e) 😇(r) 🐵(m) 😱(a) 😇(r) 🤠(k) 🤖(e) 🐸(t) 🐦(s) → \"supermarkets\".\n\nYes! That works. \"supermarkets\" is a 12-letter word. Perfect.\n\nNow let's check the other parts with these mappings:\n\nFirst word: 🦆(c) 👽(o) 🐧(l) 🤖(e) 🐦(s) → \"coles\" (could be a store name, makes sense).\n\nThe parentheses part, first word: 🦉👽😇🐵🤖😇🐧🐨 → 🦉=f (from before, \"before\" → b e f o r e), 👽=o, 😇=r, 🐵=m, 🤖=e, 😇=r, 🐧=l, 🐨=? → f o r m e r l ?. Maybe \"formerly\" (f o r m e r l y). So 🐨=y. Then the first parenthetical word is \"formerly\".\n\nParentheses part:\n\n(🦉👽😇🐵🤖😇🐧🐨 → f o r m e r l y → \"formerly\"\n\n🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 → c o l e s → \"coles\"\n\n🐻😇👽🐶😍 → g r o u p → \"group\" (🐻=g, 😇=r, 👽=o, 🐶=u, 😍=p → \"group\")\n\n🐷🤖🦉👽😇🤖 → b e f o r e → \"before\"\n\n🐱🐸🐦 → i t s → \"its\"\n\n😱🦆🦁🐶🐱🐦🐱🐸🐱👽🤮 → a c 🦁 u i s i t i o n → \"ac...uision\". Let's see, \"acquisition\" (a c q u i s i t i o n). That's 12 letters. Let's check:\n\n😱=a (1), 🦆=c (2), 🦁=q (3), 🐶=u (4), 🐱=i (5), 🐦=s (6), 🐱=i (7), 🐸=t (8), 🐱=i (9), 👽=o (10), 🤮=n (11) → \"acquisition\" (a c q u i s i t i o n). Perfect! So 🦁=q.\n\nThen:\n\n👽🤮 → o n → \"on\"\n\n23 → 23\n\n🤮👽🙄🤖🐵🐷🤖😇 → n o 🙄 e m b e r → \"november\" (n o v e m b e r). So 🙄=v. Then \"november\".\n\n2007 → 2007.\n\nPutting it all together, let's check all the emojis:\n\nConfirmed so far:\n\n🤖=e, 🤮=n, 🐷=b, 🐻=g, 🐦=s, 👽=o, 🐱=i, 😱=a, 🦆=c, 🐔=h, \n\nNew mappings from above:\n\n😇=r (from \"before\" → b e f o r e),\n\n🐶=u (from \"supermarkets\" → u),\n\n😍=p (from \"supermarkets\" → p),\n\n🐵=m (from \"supermarkets\" → m),\n\n🐸=t (from \"australian\" → t),\n\n🐧=l (from \"coles\" → l),\n\n🦉=f (from \"before\" → f),\n\n🐨=y (from \"formerly\" → y),\n\n🤠=k (from \"supermarkets\" → k),\n\n🥵=c (from \"ounce\" → c? Wait, the eighth word was \"ounce\": o u n c e. So 👽=o, 🤓=u, 🤮=n, 🤖=e, 🥵=c. So 🥵=c. But earlier we thought 🐧=l, which is correct.\n\nWait, the eighth word: 👽=o, 🤓=u, 🤮=n, 🤖=e, 🥵=c → \"ounce\" (o u n c e). So 🤓=u, 🥵=c.\n\nThe ninth word: 🐷=b, 🐨=y → \"by\" (b y). Correct.\n\nThe tenth word: 🤓=u, 🤖=e, 🐦=s, 🦉=f, 😱=a, 😇=r, 🐵=m, 🤖=e, 😇=r, 🐦=s → u e s f a r m e r s → \"uesfarmers\"? No, wait, the tenth word's emojis are 🤓🤖🐦🦉😱😇🐵🤖😇🐦 → u e s f a r m e r s → \"uesfarmers\" → but that's not a word. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let's check:\n\nThe tenth word: 🤓=u, 🤖=e, 🐦=s, 🦉=f, 😱=a, 😇=r, 🐵=m, 🤖=e, 😇=r, 🐦=s → u e s f a r m e r s → \"uesfarmers\" → maybe \"usersfarmers\"? No. Alternatively, perhaps the tenth word is \"userfarmers\", but that's not correct. Maybe the tenth word is \"usefulness\"? u s e f u l n e s s → No. Alternatively, maybe my assumption of 🦉=f is wrong. Let's go back.\n\nThe fourth word in the parentheses: 🐷🤖🦉👽😇🤖 → b e 🦉 o 😇 e. If \"before\" is correct, then 🦉=f, 😇=r. So \"before\" (b e f o r e). That works. So that's correct.\n\nThe fifth word in the parentheses: 🐱🐸🐦 → i t s → \"its\" (correct, since 🐱=i, 🐸=t, 🐦=s).\n\nThe sixth word in the parentheses: 😱🦆🦁🐶🐱🐦🐱🐸🐱👽🤮 → a c 🦁 u i s i t i o n. \"acquisition\" (a c q u i s i t i o n). So 🦁=q. That works.\n\nThe part after that: 👽🤮 → o n → \"on\".\n\nThen 23, then 🤮👽🙄🤖🐵🐷🤖😇 → n o 🙄 e m b e r → \"november\" (n o v e m b e r). So 🙄=v. That works.\n\nThe last part: 2007.\n\nPutting all together, the encoded sentence would translate to:\n\n\"coles supermarkets is an australian supermarkets chain ounce by uesfarmers (formerly coles group before its acquisition on 23 november 2007).\"\n\nWait, \"uesfarmers\" doesn't make sense. Maybe the tenth word is \"usersfarmers\"? No. Perhaps \"userfarmers\" is a typo, but maybe it's \"Wesfarmers\" (a real company). Oh! \"Wesfarmers\" is a company in Australia. Let's check:\n\nThe tenth word: 🤓🤖🐦🦉😱😇🐵🤖😇🐦 → if 🤓=w, then \"w e s ...\". \"Wesfarmers\" → w e s f a r m e r s. Let's check:\n\n🤓=w, 🤖=e, 🐦=s, 🦉=f, 😱=a, 😇=r, 🐵=m, 🤖=e, 😇=r, 🐦=s → \"wesfarmers\" (w e s f a r m e r s). Yes! That's a real company. So 🤓=w.\n\nThen the eighth word: 👽🤓🤮🤖🥵 → o w n e ?. \"Own\" is part of it. \"Owne...\" Maybe \"owned\" (o w n e d). So 🥵=d. Then the eighth word is \"owned\".\n\nThe ninth word: 🐷🐨 → b ?. If \"by\" (b y), then 🐨=y. So \"by\".\n\nSo the tenth word: \"wesfarmers\" (correct company name). That makes sense. Let's adjust 🤓=w and 🥵=d.\n\nLet's recheck:\n\nEighth word: 👽=o, 🤓=w, 🤮=n, 🤖=e, 🥵=d → \"owned\" (o w n e d). Correct.\n\nTenth word: 🤓=w, 🤖=e, 🐦=s, 🦉=f, 😱=a, 😇=r, 🐵=m, 🤖=e, 😇=r, 🐦=s → \"wesfarmers\" (w e s f a r m e r s). Perfect! That's a real company.\n\nSo now, updating the mappings:\n\n🤓=w, 🥵=d, 🐨=y (from ninth word \"by\" → b y).\n\nLet's verify all mappings:\n\n🤖=e (correct),\n\n🤮=n (correct),\n\n🐷=b (correct),\n\n🐻=g (correct),\n\n🐦=s (correct),\n\n👽=o (correct),\n\n🐱=i (correct),\n\n😱=a (correct),\n\n🦆=c (correct),\n\n🐔=h (correct),\n\n😇=r (from \"before\" → b e f o r e),\n\n🐶=u (from \"supermarkets\" → u),\n\n😍=p (from \"supermarkets\" → p),\n\n🐵=m (from \"supermarkets\" → m),\n\n🐸=t (from \"australian\" → t),\n\n🐧=l (from \"coles\" → l),\n\n🦉=f (from \"wesfarmers\" → f),\n\n🐨=y (from \"by\" → y),\n\n🤠=k (from \"supermarkets\" → k),\n\n🥵=d (from \"owned\" → d),\n\n🤓=w (from \"wesfarmers\" → w),\n\n🦁=q (from \"acquisition\" → q),\n\n🙄=v (from \"november\" → v).\n\nLet's check all these mappings against the feedback from previous attempts to ensure they don't conflict.\n\nAttempt 1 feedback:\n\n- 🐦: False (we now have 🐦=s, which was correct in attempt 2, so that's okay),\n\n- 😱: False (attempt 1 guessed 😱=i, but we have 😱=a which was correct in attempt 3, okay),\n\n- others like 🐶=a (we have 🐶=u, which is different),\n\nAttempt 2 feedback:\n\n- 😇: False (guessed 😇=a, we have 😇=r, okay),\n\n- 🐶: False (guessed 🐶=t, we have 🐶=u, okay),\n\nAttempt 3 feedback:\n\n- 🐧: False (guessed 🐧=v, we have 🐧=l, okay),\n\n- 🐨: False (guessed 🐨=r, we have 🐨=y, okay),\n\n- 😇: False (guessed 😇=m, we have 😇=r, okay),\n\n- 🐶: False (guessed 🐶=t, we have 🐶=u, okay),\n\n- 🐸: False (guessed 🐸=d, we have 🐸=t, okay),\n\n- 🐵: False (guessed 🐵=k, we have 🐵=m, okay),\n\n- 🦉: False (guessed 🦉=p, we have 🦉=f, okay),\n\n- 😍: False (guessed 😍=f, we have 😍=p, okay),\n\nAll new mappings don't conflict with previous feedback.\n\nSo the final guess should include all confirmed emojis (including the hint and previously correct ones) and the new mappings we deduced.\n\n\n\nTo solve this Crypto Word Game, we analyze the encoded sentence, feedback from previous attempts, and deduce mappings for each emoji. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Confirmed Mappings (from Feedback):\n- `🤖=e` (given hint), `🤮=n`, `🐷=b`, `🐻=g`, `🐦=s`, `👽=o`, `🐱=i`, `😱=a`, `🦆=c`, `🐔=h` (all confirmed by feedback from previous attempts).\n\n### Deductions from the Encoded Sentence:\n1. **First Word**: `🦆👽🐧🤖🐦` → `c o ? e s`. Likely \"coles\" (a common brand), so `🐧=l`.\n2. **Second\/Sixth Word**: `🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦` → `s ? ? e ? ? a ? ? e ? s`. This matches \"supermarkets\" (12 letters), so:\n   - `🐶=u` (2nd letter: u), `😍=p` (3rd letter: p), `😇=r` (5th\/8th letter: r), `🐵=m` (6th letter: m), `🤠=k` (9th letter: k), `🐸=t` (11th letter: t).\n3. **Fifth Word**: `😱🐶🐦🐸😇😱🐧🐱😱🤮` → `a u s t r a l i a n` (Australian), confirming `🐧=l` (7th letter: l).\n4. **Seventh Word**: `🦆🐔😱🐱🤮` → `c h a i n` (chain), already confirmed.\n5. **Eighth Word**: `👽🤓🤮🤖🥵` → `o ? n e ?`. Likely \"owned\" (owned), so `🤓=w` (2nd letter: w), `🥵=d` (5th letter: d).\n6. **Ninth Word**: `🐷🐨` → `b ?`. Likely \"by\" (by), so `🐨=y` (2nd letter: y).\n7. **Tenth Word**: `🤓🤖🐦🦉😱😇🐵🤖😇🐦` → `w e s f a r m e r s` (Wesfarmers, a company), so `🦉=f` (4th letter: f).\n8. **Parentheses (Acquisition)**: `😱🦆🦁🐶🐱🐦🐱🐸🐱👽🤮` → `a c q u i s i t i o n` (acquisition), so `🦁=q` (3rd letter: q).\n9. **November**: `🤮👽🙄🤖🐵🐷🤖😇` → `n o v e m b e r` (November), so `🙄=v` (3rd letter: v).\n\n### Final Mappings:\nAll confirmed and deduced mappings are compiled below.\n\nAnswer: 🤖=e,🤮=n,🐷=b,🐻=g,🐦=s,👽=o,🐱=i,😱=a,🦆=c,🐔=h,🐧=l,🐶=u,😍=p,😇=r,🐵=m,🤠=k,🐸=t,🤓=w,🥵=d,🐨=y,🦉=f,🦁=q,🙄=v"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The encoded sentence is given with emojis, and we know that 🐷=e. Let's start by analyzing the sentence and looking for patterns, especially with the known emoji.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the emojis present and their positions. The encoded sentence is:\n\n🧐🤓 1265, 🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓 🥳🐷 🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶, 6🥶🤖 🐷🦆🐶l 🐨😴 l🐷🧐c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶 🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓🐷🥳 🥶🤖🐷 😴🧐🐶🤭🥶 🐷l🐷c🥶🐷🥳 🦉🦆🐶l🧐🦆🐮🐷🤓🥶.\n\nWe know 🐷=e, so let's replace all 🐷 with e. Let's do that first:\n\n🧐🤓 1265, 🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓 🥳e 🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶, 6🥶🤖 e🦆🐶l 🐨😴 l e🧐c e🤭🥶e🐶 🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓e🥳 🥶🤖e 😴🧐🐶🤭🥶 e l e c🥶e🥳 🦉🦆🐶l🧐🦆🐮e🤓🥶.\n\nNow, let's look for words that contain 'e' since 🐷=e. Let's check the positions where 'e' (🐷) appears:\n\n- \"🥳e\" (position 4-5): This could be a two-letter word ending with 'e'. Common two-letter words ending with 'e' are 'be', 'he', 'me', 'we', 'ye'. So 🥳 could be b, h, m, w, or y.\n\n- \"e🦆🐶l\" (position 9-12): The structure is e + [emoji] + [emoji] + l. Maybe \"e...l\" like \"evil\" (but 'evil' is e-v-i-l, so maybe 🦆=v, 🐶=i). Let's check if that makes sense. \"evil\" would be e (🐷) + v (🦆) + i (🐶) + l. That's a possibility.\n\n- \"l e🧐c e🤭🥶e🐶\" (position 14-23): Breaking it down: l e [🧐] c e [🤭] [🥶] e [🐶]. Let's split into words. Maybe \"le...ce...e...\". Let's see, \"le\" could be part of \"left\", \"less\", \"leap\", etc. The next part is \"e🧐c\" which is e + [🧐] + c. That could be \"eac\", \"ebc\", \"etc\", \"exc\", \"elc\". \"etc\" is common (et cetera), so maybe 🧐=t here. If 🧐=t, then \"e🧐c\" would be etc. Let's check that. So 🧐=t. Let's tentatively say 🧐=t.\n\nIf 🧐=t, then let's update the sentence with that:\n\nt🤓 1265, 🤭t🐮🐨🤓 🥳e 🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶, 6🥶🤖 et🦆🐶l 🐨😴 l et c e🤭🥶e🐶 🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓e🥳 🥶🤖e 😴t🐶🤭🥶 et l ec🥶e🥳 🦉🦆🐶l t🦆🐮e🤓🥶.\n\nNow, \"t🤓\" (position 1-2) is a two-letter word starting with t. Common ones: \"to\", \"tw\", \"ta\", \"ti\", \"te\". Let's see if \"to\" makes sense. If 🤓=o, then \"to\" is possible. Let's try that. So 🤓=o.\n\nUpdating with 🤓=o:\n\nto 1265, 🤭t🐮🐨o 🥳e 🐮🐨o🥶😴🐨🐶🥶, 6🥶🤖 et🦆🐶l 🐨😴 l et c e🤭🥶e🐶 🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨oe🥳 🥶🤖e 😴t🐶🤭🥶 et l ec🥶e🥳 🦉🦆🐶l t🦆🐮eo🥶.\n\nNow, \"to 1265\" – maybe that's a number, like a year or code, but not sure yet. Next part: \"🤭t🐮🐨o\" (position 4-8). Let's say this is a word. Let's split into letters: [🤭] t [🐮] [🐨] o. Maybe a 5-letter word ending with \"to\" or \"t...o\". Let's see. \"st...o\" could be \"stone\" (s-t-o-n-e) but here the structure is [🤭] t [🐮] [🐨] o. If \"stone\" is s-t-o-n-e, but here the last letter is o, so maybe not. Alternatively, \"plant\" (p-l-a-n-t), but no. Maybe \"fruit\" (f-r-u-i-t) no. Alternatively, \"br...o\" like \"brown\" (b-r-o-w-n) but not. Let's look at another part.\n\nThe next word is \"🥳e\" (position 9-10). If \"to\" (position 1-2) is correct, then \"🥳e\" could be \"be\" (if 🥳=b), \"he\" (h), \"me\" (m), \"we\" (w). Let's check later parts. The word \"et l ec🥶e🥳\" (position 33-38): \"et l ec[🥶]e[🥳]\". Maybe \"et\" is \"et\" (as in etc.), \"l\" could be \"l\" (as a word, like \"L\" in a name, but maybe \"el\" as part of a word). \"ec[🥶]e[🥳]\" could be \"ec...e...\". Like \"echoes\" (e-c-h-o-e-s), but \"ec\" followed by [🥶] (h?), e, [🥳] (s). If [🥶]=h and [🥳]=s, then \"echoes\". Let's check: \"ec\" (e-c) + h (🥶) + e + s (🥳) = echoes. That's a 6-letter word. So \"ec🥶e🥳\" would be echoes. Then [🥶]=h and [🥳]=s. Let's test that. So 🥶=h, 🥳=s.\n\nUpdating with 🥳=s, 🥶=h:\n\nto 1265, 🤭t🐮🐨o se 🐮🐨o h 😴🐨🐶h, 6h🤖 et🦆🐶l 🐨😴 l et c e🤭h e🐶 🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨oe s h🤖e 😴t🐶🤭h et l ec h e s 🦉🦆🐶l t🦆🐮eo h.\n\nNow, \"se\" (position 9-10) is \"se\", which is a valid word (like \"se\" in Spanish, but maybe \"see\" but that's three letters. Wait, \"🥳e\" is se. \"se\" could be part of a larger word, but let's check other parts. The word \"h🤖e\" (position 29-31): \"h[🤖]e\". Common 3-letter words: \"the\" (t-h-e), \"she\" (s-h-e), \"he\" (h-e), but here it's h + [🤖] + e. \"the\" would be t-h-e, so [🤖]=t. But we already have 🧐=t. Can't have duplicates. \"she\" is s-h-e, [🤖]=s. But 🥳=s. Duplicate. \"he\" is h-e, but that's two letters. Maybe \"hive\" (h-i-v-e) but that's 4 letters. Hmm. Let's look elsewhere.\n\nThe part \"6h🤖\" (position 7-9): 6 h [🤖]. Maybe a code, like \"6th...\" (6th), but 6h[🤖] would be 6 h [🤖]. If \"6th\" then [🤖]=t, but 🧐=t. Maybe \"6th\" is 6 t h, but no. Let's check \"et l ec h e s\" (position 33-38): \"et l echoes\". Maybe \"et\" (as in etc.), \"l\" (like \"L\"), \"echoes\". That could make sense.\n\nLooking at \"et🦆🐶l\" (position 11-14): \"et[🦆][🐶]l\". If \"evil\" (e-v-i-l), then [🦆]=v, [🐶]=i. Let's test that. So 🦆=v, 🐶=i.\n\nUpdating with 🦆=v, 🐶=i:\n\nto 1265, 🤭t🐮🐨o se 🐮🐨o h 😴🐨i h, 6h🤖 etvil 🐨😴 l et c e🤭h ei 🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨oe s h🤖e 😴t i 🤭h et l ec h e s 🦉vil t v🐮eo h.\n\n\"etvil\" (position 11-14) would be \"evil\" if the letters are e-t-v-i-l? Wait, no, \"evil\" is e-v-i-l. Oh, maybe \"etvil\" is a typo or part of a longer word, but maybe \"evil\" is \"e v i l\" (e=🐷, v=🦆, i=🐶, l=l). So \"e v i l\" would be \"evil\". The position 9-12 is \"e v i l\", so \"evil\" is in position 9-12: \"e🦆🐶l\" (e v i l). That makes sense. So \"e🦆🐶l\" is \"evil\" (e-v-i-l), so 🦆=v, 🐶=i. Correct. So \"etvil\" (position 11-14) would be \"etvil\" – maybe \"evildoer\" part, but let's check the next part.\n\nThe word \"🐨😴\" (position 15-16): [🐨][😴]. Let's say this is a two-letter word. If \"🐨\" is a letter, maybe \"it\" (i-t), but i=🐶. \"he\" (h-e), e=🐷. \"go\" (g-o), o=🤓. \"so\" (s-o), s=🥳. \"we\" (w-e), e=🐷. \"my\" (m-y). Let's see other parts. The word \"l et c e🤭h ei\" (position 17-24): \"l et c e[🤭]h ei\". \"l\" could be \"L\" (name), \"et\" (etc.), \"c\" (maybe \"c\" as a word, like \"C\"), \"e[🤭]h\" (e + [🤭] + h). Common 3-letter words: \"each\" (e-a-c-h), \"echo\" (e-c-h-o), \"edge\" (e-d-g-e), \"eel\" (e-e-l), \"ewe\" (e-w-e). Here, \"e[🤭]h\" is 3 letters (e, [🤭], h). \"each\" would be e-a-h, so [🤭]=a. Let's try that. So 🤭=a.\n\nUpdating with 🤭=a:\n\nto 1265, a t 🐮🐨o se 🐮🐨o h 😴🐨i h, 6h🤖 etvil 🐨😴 l et c e a h ei a 🐱🐮🐮🐨oe s h🤖e 😴t i a h et l ec h e s 🦉vil t v🐮eo h.\n\nNow, \"a t 🐮🐨o\" (position 4-8): \"a t [🐮][🐨] o\". That's a 5-letter word: a-t-[🐮]-[🐨]-o. Possible words: \"table\" (t-a-b-l-e) no, structure is a-t-?-?-o. \"tango\" (t-a-n-g-o) but starts with t. \"ato...o\" maybe \"atoll\" (a-t-o-l-l) no. \"atroc\" (a-t-r-o-c) no. \"attack\" (a-t-t-a-c-k) no. Let's look at \"a 🐱🐮🐮🐨oe s\" (position 25-30): \"a [🐱][🐮][🐮][🐨]oe s\". Let's split: \"a [🐱][🐮][🐮][🐨]oe\" + \"s\". Maybe \"a [something]oes s\". \"Goes\" is g-o-e-s, but \"oe\" here. \"Doe\" is d-o-e. \"Does\" is d-o-e-s. So if \"a [🐱][🐮][🐮][🐨]oes s\" could be \"a person does s\" or something. Let's think: \"a [letters]oes s\". Let's say \"a person does s\". \"Person\" is p-e-r-s-o-n. Maybe \"a person does s\" would be \"a p e r s o n does s\". But the structure is [🐱][🐮][🐮][🐨]oe. Let's see: [🐱][🐮][🐮][🐨] o e. So o and e are known (🤓=o, 🐷=e). So [🐱][🐮][🐮][🐨] o e. Maybe \"person\" is p-e-r-s-o-n, but here o and e are at the end. \"Something\" like \"someone\" (s-o-m-e-o-n-e). Not sure. Let's check another part.\n\nThe word \"😴t i a h\" (position 31-35): \"[😴]t i a h\". That's [😴]-t-i-a-h. Maybe \"start\" (s-t-a-r-t), but structure is [😴]-t-i-a-h. \"Smart\" (s-m-a-r-t) no. \"Chart\" (c-h-a-r-t) no. \"Heart\" (h-e-a-r-t) no. Let's check \"🐨😴\" (position 15-16) again. If \"🐨\" is n and \"😴\" is s, then \"ns\", but not helpful. Alternatively, \"🐨\"=n, \"😴\"=w: \"nw\" no. Let's look at \"l et c\" (position 17-19): \"l et c\". \"l et c\" could be \"L et c\" (like \"L et cetera\"). \"et c\" is \"etc\", which makes sense. So \"l et c\" is \"L etc\". That works.\n\nThe part \"e a h ei\" (position 21-24): \"eah ei\". \"Ea\" could be \"ea\" (as in \"ear\"), \"h ei\" could be \"he i\". Maybe \"each ei\" – \"each I\"?\n\nLooking at \"a 🐱🐮🐮🐨oe s\" (position 25-30): Let's suppose \"a [🐱][🐮][🐮][🐨]oes s\" is \"a certainoes s\". Not helpful. Let's try to find the word \"🐮🐨o\" (position 6-8 and 12-14). It appears in two places: \"🐮🐨o\" (position 6-8: \"🐮🐨o\") and \"🐮🐨o\" (position 12-14: \"🐮🐨o\"). So it's a 3-letter word. Let's think of 3-letter words ending with o: \"ago\", \"bio\", \"cow\" (no, ends with w), \"coo\", \"doe\" (ends with e), \"ego\", \"foo\", \"go\", \"hoe\", \"joe\", \"leo\", \"moo\", \"no\", \"oho\", \"owe\", \"piano\" (no, 5 letters), \"rho\", \"so\", \"toe\", \"two\", \"who\", \"you\". Let's see. If \"🐮🐨o\" is \"who\", then \"w-h-o\". So 🐮=w, 🐨=h. But we already have 🥶=h. Oh, duplicates aren't allowed. Each emoji is unique. So 🐨 can't be h. Next, \"ego\": e-g-o. e=🐷, o=🤓. So \"ego\" would be e (🐷)-g (🐮)-o (🤓). So \"🐮🐨o\" would be \"ego\" if 🐮=g, 🐨= (but \"ego\" is e-g-o, so 🐮=g, 🐨 would not be part of it. Wait, \"🐮🐨o\" is three letters: [🐮], [🐨], o. So if \"ego\" is e-g-o, but e is a different emoji (🐷=e), so \"ego\" would be [other emoji] for e. So maybe \"ago\": a-g-o. a=🤭, so \"ago\" would be a (🤭)-g (🐮)-o (🤓). So \"a t 🐮🐨o\" (position 4-8) would be \"a t g [🐨] o\". \"Atgo...\" doesn't make sense. Maybe \"too\": t-o-o. But o=🤓, so \"too\" would be t (🧐)-o (🤓)-o (🤓). But that would require two o's, but the emoji for o is 🤓, so \"too\" would be 🧐🤓🤓. But in our case, \"🐮🐨o\" is three different emojis, so \"too\" would need two 🤓s, which isn't the case. So \"🐮🐨o\" can't be \"too\". Let's think of \"leo\": l-e-o. l is a letter, e=🐷, o=🤓. So \"leo\" would be l (l)-e (🐷)-o (🤓). But \"🐮🐨o\" is [🐮][🐨]o, so \"leo\" would be 🐮=l, 🐨=e. But e=🐷, so 🐨=e would conflict. Can't do that. \"Joe\": j-o-e. o=🤓, e=🐷. So \"Joe\" would be j (🐮)-o (🤓)-e (🐷). But \"🐮🐨o\" is [🐮][🐨]o, so \"Joe\" would be 🐮=j, 🐨= (needs to be something else). Not matching. \"Moo\": m-o-o. o=🤓, so \"moo\" would be m (🐮)-o (🤓)-o (🤓). Again, two o's, which would need two 🤓s. \"No\": n-o. But \"🐮🐨o\" is three letters. \"So\": s-o. Also two letters. \"Toe\": t-o-e. t=🧐, o=🤓, e=🐷. So \"toe\" would be t (🧐)-o (🤓)-e (🐷). But \"🐮🐨o\" is [🐮][🐨]o. So \"toe\" would be 🐮=t (but 🧐=t), 🐨=o (but 🤓=o). Conflict. \"Who\": w-h-o. So \"who\" would be w (🐮)-h (🐨)-o (🤓). That fits: 🐮=w, 🐨=h, 🤓=o. Let's check that. If 🐮=w and 🐨=h, then \"🐮🐨o\" (position 6-8) would be \"who\" (w-h-o). Let's try that.\n\nUpdating with 🐮=w, 🐨=h:\n\nto 1265, a t w h o se w h o h 😴h i h, 6h🤖 etvil h 😴 l et c e a h ei a 🐱w w h o e s h🤖e 😴t i a h et l ec h e s 🦉vil t v w e o h.\n\nNow, \"a t w h o\" (position 4-8) is \"atwho\"? Wait, \"a t w h o\" would be \"a t who\" – maybe \"At who\" (but \"At\" is a preposition). Maybe it's a typo in the encoded sentence, or maybe it's \"At whom\" but \"whom\" is longer. Let's check \"w h o\" (position 6-8): \"who\" (w-h-o) which is correct. So \"se\" (position 9-10) is \"se\". \"se\" could be \"see\" but that's three letters. \"w h o h\" (position 12-15): \"who h\" – maybe \"who he\" (if h is he, but \"h\" is a letter). Let's check \"h 😴h i h\" (position 12-16): \"h [😴] h i h\". That's \"h [😴] h i h\". Maybe \"hath\" (h-a-t-h) but structure is h [😴] h i h. \"Him\" is h-i-m, but i=🐶. \"His\" is h-i-s, s=🥳. \"H is h i h\" – maybe \"H is his h\". Not clear. Let's look at \"h 😴\" (position 15-16): \"h [😴]\". If \"h [😴]\" is \"he\" (h-e), then [😴]=e. But e=🐷. Can't. \"hi\" (h-i), i=🐶. So [😴]=i. But i=🐶. \"ho\" (h-o), o=🤓. So [😴]=o. But o=🤓. \"ha\" (h-a), a=🤭. So [😴]=a. Let's try [😴]=a. Then \"h a h i h\" (position 12-16): \"h a h i h\" which is \"hahih\" – not a word. Maybe \"h [😴] h i h\" is \"hath i h\" (h-a-t-h i h). If [😴]=t, but t=🧐. Hmm.\n\nThe word \"h 🐱w w h o e s\" (position 25-30): \"h [🐱]w w h o e s\". Let's split: \"h [🐱]w w h o e s\". Maybe \"h [something] whoes s\". \"Whoes\" isn't a word. \"Whose\" is w-h-o-s-e. So \"whose\" would be w (🐮)-h (🐨)-o (🤓)-s (🥳)-e (🐷). Let's check \"w h o s e\" (🐮🐨🤓🥳🐷): \"w h o s e\" = \"whose\". That's a valid word. Let's see where \"whose\" might be. In the original encoded sentence, there's \"🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓🐷🥳\" (position 25-32). Let's replace the known emojis: 🤭=a, 🐮=w, 🐨=h, 🤓=o, 🐷=e, 🥳=s. So \"a 🐱w w h o e s\" (position 25-32). That's \"a [🐱]w w h o e s\". \"a [🐱]w whose s\" – maybe \"a person whose s\". \"Person\" is p-e-r-s-o-n. If [🐱]=p, then \"a p w w h o e s\" would be \"a pwwhoes\" – no. Maybe \"a [🐱]w\" is \"a new\" (a-n-e-w). So [🐱]=n, \"a n w\" = \"anw\" (no). \"a few\" (a-f-e-w), [🐱]=f. \"a few whose s\" – \"a few whose s\" could make sense. So [🐱]=f. Let's try that. 🐱=f.\n\nUpdating with 🐱=f:\n\nto 1265, a t w h o se w h o h 😴h i h, 6h🤖 etvil h 😴 l et c e a h ei a f w w h o e s h🤖e 😴t i a h et l ec h e s 🦉vil t v w e o h.\n\nNow, \"a f w w h o e s\" (position 25-32): \"a few whose s\" – \"a few whose s\". That could be part of a sentence: \"a few whose s...\" Maybe \"a few whose secrets\" or something. Let's check \"h🤖e\" (position 29-31): \"h [🤖] e\". If [🤖]=r, then \"hre\" – no. \"h e r\" (h-e-r) would be \"her\" (h-e-r). So [🤖]=r. \"h r e\" – \"hre\" isn't a word. \"h a r\" (h-a-r) – \"har\" no. \"h i r\" (h-i-r) – \"hir\" no. \"h t r\" (h-t-r) – \"htr\" no. Let's check \"6h🤖\" (position 7-9): \"6 h [🤖]\". If \"6th\" (6-t-h), but t=🧐. \"6hr\" (6-h-r) could be \"6hr\" (6 hours). So [🤖]=r. Let's try that. 🤖=r.\n\nUpdating with 🤖=r:\n\nto 1265, a t w h o se w h o h 😴h i h, 6h r etvil h 😴 l et c e a h ei a f w w h o e s h r e 😴t i a h et l ec h e s 🦉vil t v w e o h.\n\nNow, \"h r e\" (position 29-31) is \"hre\" – not a word. Maybe \"her\" (h-e-r). But \"h r e\" is reversed. Let's check \"et l ec h e s\" (position 33-38): \"et l echoes\". \"et\" (etc.), \"l\" (maybe \"L\"), \"echoes\". That works. \"echoes\" is e-c-h-o-e-s (e=🐷, c=c, h=🥶, o=🤓, e=🐷, s=🥳). Correct. \n\nThe part \"😴t i a h\" (position 31-35): \"[😴]t i a h\". If [😴]=s, then \"stiah\" – no. [😴]=c: \"ctiah\" no. [😴]=b: \"btiah\" no. [😴]=k: \"ktiah\" no. Let's look at \"h 😴\" (position 15-16): \"h [😴]\". If \"h [😴]\" is \"he\" (h-e), [😴]=e (but e=🐷). \"hi\" (h-i), [😴]=i (i=🐶). \"ho\" (h-o), [😴]=o (o=🤓). \"ha\" (h-a), [😴]=a (a=🤭). \"hm\" (h-m), [😴]=m. Let's try [😴]=m. Then \"h m h i h\" (position 12-16): \"hmhih\" – no. [😴]=d: \"hdhih\" no. [😴]=g: \"hghih\" no. [😴]=l: \"hlhih\" no. \n\nLet's check the word \"🦉vil\" (position 39-42): \"🦉v i l\". \"vil\" could be part of \"village\" but \"🦉vil\" might be \"evil\" but we already have \"evil\". \"Gavil\" (a name), \"Ravil\", \"Kavil\". If \"🦉\" is k, then \"kvil\" – no. Maybe \"🦉\" is a letter like \"k\" or \"g\". Let's leave that for now.\n\nLet's recap the emojis we've tentatively assigned:\n\n🐷=e (given)\n🧐=t (from \"etc\")\n🤓=o (from \"to\")\n🥳=s (from \"echoes\" ending with s)\n🥶=h (from \"echoes\" has h)\n🤭=a (from \"each\")\n🦆=v (from \"evil\")\n🐶=i (from \"evil\")\n🐮=w (from \"who\")\n🐨=h (Wait, no, earlier I thought 🐨=h but that would conflict with 🥶=h. Oh no! That's a mistake. Because if 🥶=h, then 🐨 can't be h. Oh, that's a problem. Let's correct that.\n\nEarlier, I thought \"🐮🐨o\" could be \"who\" (w-h-o), which would require 🐨=h. But we already have 🥶=h (from \"echoes\" having h). So that's a duplicate. So that's incorrect. Need to backtrack.\n\nLet's try a different approach for \"🐮🐨o\". Let's think of \"foo\": f-o-o. o=🤓, so \"foo\" would be f (🐮)-o (🤓)-o (🤓). But \"🐮🐨o\" is three different emojis, so can't have two o's. \"Bar\": b-a-r. No, ends with r. \"Car\": c-a-r. No. \"Dog\": d-o-g. o=🤓, so \"dog\" would be d (🐮)-o (🤓)-g (🐨). So \"dog\" (d-o-g) would be 🐮=d, 🐨=g, 🤓=o. Let's try that. So 🐮=d, 🐨=g, 🤓=o.\n\nUpdating with 🐮=d, 🐨=g, 🤓=o:\n\nto 1265, a t d g o se d g o h 😴g i h, 6h🤖 etvil g 😴 l et c e a h ei a 🐱d d g o e s h🤖e 😴t i a h et l ec h e s 🦉vil t v d e o h.\n\nNow, \"a t d g o\" (position 4-8): \"atdgo\" – maybe \"at dog\" (a-t d-o-g). \"at dog\" makes sense if it's \"At dog...\". \"d g o\" (position 6-8) is \"dog\" (d-o-g), which fits (d=🐮, o=🤓, g=🐨). That works! So \"dog\" is 🐮🤓🐨 = d-o-g. Great, no duplicate here. \n\n\"se\" (position 9-10) is \"se\" – could be \"see\" but that's three letters. \"d g o h\" (position 12-15): \"dog h\" – \"dog he\" (h=🥶). \"h 😴g i h\" (position 12-16): \"h [😴]g i h\". Maybe \"hug ih\" (h-u-g i h). If [😴]=u, then \"h u g i h\" = \"hugih\" – not a word. \"hag ih\" (h-a-g i h) if [😴]=a, but a=🤭. \"hog ih\" (h-o-g i h), o=🤓. \"hog ih\" – \"hog ih\". Maybe \"hog is h\" (h-o-g i-s h). \"is\" is i-s, s=🥳. So \"hog is h\" – \"hog is h\". Maybe \"hog is here\" but not sure. \n\nThe word \"g 😴\" (position 15-16): \"g [😴]\". \"go\" (g-o), o=🤓. \"he\" (h-e), e=🐷. \"hi\" (h-i), i=🐶. \"gu\" (g-u). Let's say [😴]=u. So \"g u\" = \"gu\". \"l et c\" (position 17-19): \"l et c\" = \"L etc\". \"e a h ei\" (position 21-24): \"eah ei\" = \"each I\". \"a 🐱d d g o e s\" (position 25-32): \"a [🐱]d doges s\". \"doges\" is d-o-g-e-s (d=🐮, o=🤓, g=🐨, e=🐷, s=🥳). \"doges\" is a valid word (plural of doge). So \"a [🐱]d doges s\" – \"a [something]d doges s\". \"a breed doges s\" (b-r-e-e-d). If [🐱]=b, then \"a b d doges s\" = \"abd doges s\" – no. \"a friend doges s\" (f-r-i-e-n-d). [🐱]=f: \"a f d doges s\" = \"afd doges s\" – no. \"a kind doges s\" (k-i-n-d). [🐱]=k: \"a k d doges s\" = \"akd doges s\" – no. \"a cold doges s\" (c-o-l-d). [🐱]=c: \"a c d doges s\" = \"acd doges s\" – no. Maybe \"a few doges s\" (f-e-w). [🐱]=f: \"a f d doges s\" = \"afd doges s\" – no. \n\nThe word \"h🤖e\" (position 29-31): \"h [🤖] e\". \"the\" (t-h-e) but t=🧐. \"she\" (s-h-e) s=🥳. \"he\" (h-e). \"he\" is two letters, so \"h [🤖] e\" could be \"her\" (h-e-r). So [🤖]=r. Let's try that. 🤖=r.\n\nUpdating with 🤖=r:\n\nto 1265, a t d g o se d g o h 😴g i h, 6h r etvil g 😴 l et c e a h ei a 🐱d d g o e s h r e 😴t i a h et l ec h e s 🦉vil t v d e o h.\n\n\"h r e\" (position 29-31) is \"hre\" – no. \"her\" would be h-e-r (h=🥶, e=🐷, r=🤖). So \"her\" would be 🥶🐷🤖 = h-e-r. Let's check where \"her\" might be. In the encoded sentence, there's \"🥶🤖🐷\" (position 29-31): 🥶=h, 🤖=r, 🐷=e. So \"h r e\" = \"hre\", which is \"her\" reversed? Maybe a typo. Alternatively, \"h r e\" could be \"her\" with letters in order. Maybe the encoded sentence has \"🥶🤖🐷\" = h-r-e = \"her\". Yes! \"her\" is h-e-r, but the encoded emoji is 🥶🤖🐷, which would be h-r-e. That's reversed. Maybe the sentence has a typo, but we'll proceed.\n\nThe word \"😴t i a h\" (position 31-35): \"[😴]t i a h\". If [😴]=s, then \"stiah\" – no. [😴]=c: \"ctiah\" no. [😴]=b: \"btiah\" no. Let's look at \"et l ec h e s\" (position 33-38): \"et l echoes\" (etc. L echoes). That works. \n\nThe last part: \"🦉vil t v d e o h\" (position 39-46): \"🦉vil t v d e o h\". \"vil\" could be \"evil\" (e-v-i-l) but e=🐷, v=🦆, i=🐶, l=l. \"t v d e o h\" (t-v-d-e-o-h) = \"tvdeoh\" – maybe \"tv show\" (t-v s-h-o-w) but not matching. \n\nLet's list out the emojis we have so far:\n\n🐷=e (given)\n🧐=t\n🤓=o\n🥳=s\n🥶=h\n🤭=a\n🦆=v\n🐶=i\n🐮=d\n🐨=g\n🤖=r\n😴=?\n🐱=?\n🦉=?\n\nWe need to guess as many as possible. Let's check the word \"🐨😴\" (position 15-16): 🐨=g, so \"g[😴]\". Possible two-letter words: \"go\" (g-o), \"he\" (h-e), \"hi\" (h-i), \"gu\" (g-u), \"ge\" (g-e), \"ga\" (g-a), \"gb\" (no), \"gc\" (no), etc. \"go\" is g-o, o=🤓, so \"go\" would be g (🐨)-o (🤓) = 🐨🤓. But \"🐨😴\" is 🐨😴, so if \"go\", then 😴=o. But o=🤓. So no. \"gu\" is g-u, so 😴=u. Let's assume 😴=u. Then \"g u\" = \"gu\".\n\nUpdating 😴=u:\n\nto 1265, a t d g o se d g o h u g i h, 6h r etvil g u l et c e a h ei a 🐱d d g o e s h r e u t i a h et l ec h e s 🦉vil t v d e o h.\n\nNow, \"h u g i h\" (position 12-16): \"hugih\" – maybe \"hug is h\" (h-u-g i-s h). \"is\" is i-s (i=🐶, s=🥳), so \"i s\" = \"is\". \"hug is h\" – \"hug is h\". Maybe \"hug is here\" but not sure. \n\nThe word \"g u\" (position 15-16): \"gu\" – maybe \"gu\" as part of \"gull\" or \"gush\". \n\nThe word \"a 🐱d d g o e s\" (position 25-32): \"a [🐱]d doges s\". \"doges\" is correct. Let's say [🐱]=k, then \"a k d doges s\" = \"akd doges s\" – no. [🐱]=m: \"amd doges s\" – no. [🐱]=n: \"and doges s\" – \"and doges s\" makes sense! \"and doges s\". So if [🐱]=n, then \"a n d doges s\" = \"and doges s\". That works! So 🐱=n.\n\nUpdating 🐱=n:\n\nto 1265, a t d g o se d g o h u g i h, 6h r etvil g u l et c e a h ei a n d d g o e s h r e u t i a h et l ec h e s 🦉vil t v d e o h.\n\nNow, \"a n d\" (position 25-27): \"and\" (a-n-d). Perfect! a=🤭, n=🐱, d=🐮. So \"and\" is 🤭🐱🐮 = a-n-d. That works. \n\nThe word \"a n d d g o e s\" (position 25-32): \"and doges s\" – \"and doges s\". \"doges\" is d-o-g-e-s (d=🐮, o=🤓, g=🐨, e=🐷, s=🥳). Correct. \n\nThe part \"e a h ei\" (position 21-24): \"eah ei\" – \"each I\" (e-a-c-h I). \"each\" is e-a-c-h (e=🐷, a=🤭, c=c, h=🥶). Correct. So \"each I\" makes sense. \n\nThe word \"u t i a h\" (position 32-36): \"utiah\" – maybe \"until\" (u-n-t-i-l) but not. \"ut i a h\" – \"ut I a h\" – not sure. \n\nThe last part: \"🦉vil t v d e o h\" (position 39-46): \"🦉vil t v d e o h\". \"vil\" could be \"evil\" (e-v-i-l), but \"🦉vil\" might be \"kvil\" (if 🦉=k) or \"mvil\" (m). Let's assume 🦉=k. Then \"kvil t v d e o h\" – \"kvil tvdeoh\". Not helpful, but maybe it's a name or a typo. \n\nNow, let's list all the emojis we have:\n\n🧐=t, 🤓=o, 🤭=a, 🐮=d, 🐨=g, 🥳=s, 🐷=e (given), 🥶=h, 😴=u, 🐶=i, 🦆=v, 🤖=r, 🐱=n, 🦉=k (tentative).\n\nWe need to include all known emojis in the answer, including the hint (🐷=e) and any we've guessed. Let's check if all our guesses are unique (no duplicates). Each emoji has a unique letter:\n\n🧐=t, 🤓=o, 🤭=a, 🐮=d, 🐨=g, 🥳=s, 🐷=e, 🥶=h, 😴=u, 🐶=i, 🦆=v, 🤖=r, 🐱=n, 🦉=k. All unique. \n\nNow, let's verify the encoded sentence with these mappings:\n\nEncoded Sentence: 🧐🤓 1265, 🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓 🥳🐷 🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶, 6🥶🤖 🐷🦆🐶l 🐨😴 l🐷🧐c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶 🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓🐷🥳 🥶🤖🐷 😴🧐🐶🤭🥶 🐷l🐷c🥶🐷🥳 🦉🦆🐶l🧐🦆🐮🐷🤓🥶.\n\nReplacing each emoji:\n\n🧐=t, 🤓=o → to\n🤭=a, 🧐=t, 🐮=d, 🐨=g, 🤓=o → a t d g o → \"atdog\" (maybe \"at dog\")\n🥳=s, 🐷=e → se\n🐮=d, 🐨=g, 🤓=o, 🥶=h, 😴=u, 🐨=g, 🐶=i, 🥶=h → d g o h u g i h → \"dog hugih\"\n6🥶🤖 → 6 h r → \"6hr\"\n🐷=e, 🦆=v, 🐶=i, l → e v i l → \"evil\"\n🐨=g, 😴=u → g u → \"gu\"\nl🐷🧐c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶 → l e t c e a h e i → \"letce ahei\" (maybe \"let c each ei\" → \"let c each I\")\n🤭=a, 🐱=n, 🐮=d, 🐮=d, 🐨=g, 🤓=o, 🐷=e, 🥳=s → a n d d g o e s → \"and doges\"\n🥶=h, 🤖=r, 🐷=e → h r e → \"hre\" (maybe \"her\")\n😴=u, 🧐=t, 🐶=i, 🤭=a, 🥶=h → u t i a h → \"utiah\"\n🐷=e, l, 🐷=e, c, 🥶=h, 🐷=e, 🥳=s → e l e c h e s → \"echoes\"\n🦉=k, 🦆=v, 🐶=i, l, 🧐=t, 🦆=v, 🐮=d, 🐷=e, 🤓=o, 🥶=h → k v i l t v d e o h → \"kviltvdeoh\" (unclear, but maybe a name or code)\n\nPutting it all together (with some spaces):\n\nto 1265, atdog se dog hugih, 6hr evil gu letce ahei and doges hre utiah echoes kviltvdeoh.\n\nThis makes some sense, with \"to\", \"se\", \"dog\", \"evil\", \"and doges\", \"echoes\" being recognizable words. The numbers and some parts might be placeholders or typos, but overall the guesses seem consistent.\n\nTo solve the Crypto Word Game, we start by analyzing the encoded sentence with the given hint that 🐷=e. We then identify patterns and use common word structures to deduce the corresponding letters for each emoji. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **🐷=e** (given hint).  \n2. **🧐=t**: The substring \"e🧐c\" appears, which is likely \"etc\" (et cetera), so 🧐=t.  \n3. **🤓=o**: The two-letter word \"🧐🤓\" starts with t (🧐=t), so it's likely \"to\", making 🤓=o.  \n4. **🥳=s**: The word \"🥳🐷\" (two letters ending with e) is likely \"se\" (a valid word), so 🥳=s.  \n5. **🥶=h**: The substring \"ec🥶e🥳\" (part of \"echoes\") suggests \"ec\" + h + \"e\" + s, so 🥶=h.  \n6. **🤭=a**: The substring \"e🤭h\" (three letters with e and h) is likely \"each\", so 🤭=a.  \n7. **🦆=v** and **🐶=i**: The word \"🐷🦆🐶l\" (e + ? + ? + l) is likely \"evil\" (e-v-i-l), so 🦆=v and 🐶=i.  \n8. **🐮=d** and **🐨=g**: The repeated substring \"🐮🐨🤓\" (three letters ending with o) is likely \"dog\" (d-o-g), so 🐮=d and 🐨=g.  \n9. **🤖=r**: The substring \"6🥶🤖\" (6 + h + ?) is likely \"6hr\" (6 hours), so 🤖=r.  \n10. **😴=u**: The two-letter word \"🐨😴\" (g + ?) is likely \"gu\" (a valid syllable), so 😴=u.  \n11. **🐱=n**: The substring \"🤭🐱🐮\" (a + ? + d) is likely \"and\" (a-n-d), so 🐱=n.  \n12. **🦉=k**: Tentatively assigned as a placeholder for the remaining emoji.  \n\nAnswer: 🧐=t,🤓=o,🤭=a,🐮=d,🐨=g,🥳=s,🐷=e,🥶=h,😴=u,🐶=i,🦆=v,🤖=r,🐱=n,🦉=k","Okay, let's try to figure out the correct emojis this time. The encoded sentence is: 🧐🤓 1265, 🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓 🥳🐷 🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶, 6🥶🤖 🐷🦆🐶l 🐨😴 l🐷🧐c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶 🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓🐷🥳 🥶🤖🐷 😴🧐🐶🤭🥶 🐷l🐷c🥶🐷🥳 🦉🦆🐶l🧐🦆🐮🐷🤓🥶.\n\nWe know that 🐷=e from the hint, and in the first attempt, they guessed a bunch but only 🐷 was correct. So the rest of those emojis (🧐, 🤓, 🤭, etc.) are not the letters they guessed. Let's look at the sentence structure.\n\nFirst, the encoded sentence starts with \"🧐🤓 1265,\" which might be a word followed by a number. Let's assume the first part is a two-letter word. The next part is \"🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓 🥳🐷\" — so that's a 5-letter word, then a 2-letter word (since 🥳 is one emoji, 🐷 is e). Since 🐷=e, 🥳🐷 would be a 2-letter word ending with e. Common 2-letter words ending with e are \"be\", \"he\", \"me\", \"we\", \"ye\". So maybe 🥳 is b, h, m, w, or y.\n\nNext part: \"🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶\" — that's 7 letters. Let's note the structure. Then \"6🥶🤖\" — 3 letters (6 is a number, maybe a placeholder). Then \"🐷🦆🐶l\" — since 🐷=e, this is e + 🦆 + 🐶 + l. So \"e\" followed by two letters and then \"l\", making a 4-letter word ending with l. Maybe \"bell\", \"cell\", \"fell\", \"hell\", \"jell\", \"kell\", \"mell\", \"nell\", \"pell\", \"sell\", \"tell\", \"vell\", \"well\", \"yell\". So 🦆 could be b, c, f, h, j, k, m, n, p, s, t, v, w, y. And 🐶 would be the next letter. For example, if it's \"bell\", then 🦆=b, 🐶=l, but wait, \"l\" is already a letter here. Wait, the word is \"e\" + 🦆 + 🐶 + l. So the structure is e (🐷) + [🦆] + [🐶] + l. So letters are e, [🦆], [🐶], l. So the word would be 4 letters: positions 1=e, 2=🦆, 3=🐶, 4=l. So possible words: \"eall\" (unlikely), \"ebbl\" (no), \"eccl\" (no), \"edel\" (no), \"eell\" (no), \"efel\" (no), \"eggl\" (no), \"ehel\" (no), \"eiel\" (no), \"ejel\" (no), \"ekel\" (no), \"elal\" (no), \"emel\" (no), \"enel\" (no), \"eper\" (no), maybe \"evul\" (no), \"ewol\" (no). Hmm, maybe \"evil\"? Wait, \"evil\" is e-v-i-l. Oh! \"evil\" is e (🐷) + v (🦆) + i (🐶) + l. That fits! So \"evil\" would be e (🐷) v (🦆) i (🐶) l. That's a common word. Let's check. If that's the case, then 🦆=v, 🐶=i. Let's see if that makes sense.\n\nThen \"🐨😴 l🐷🧐c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶\" — let's parse that. \"🐨😴\" is two letters. Then \"l🐷🧐c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶\" — l + e (🐷) + 🧐 + c + e (🐷) + 🤭 + 🥶 + e (🐷) + 🐶. So the structure here is l e [🧐] c e [🤭] [🥶] e [🐶]. Let's count the letters: l, e, 🧐, c, e, 🤭, 🥶, e, 🐶. That's 9 letters. Maybe a longer word. Let's see, if \"evil\" is correct (🦆=v, 🐶=i), then the next part \"🐨😴\" is two letters. Let's hold that thought.\n\nNext part: \"🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓🐷🥳\" — that's 8 letters. Let's break it down: 🤭, 🐱, 🐮, 🐮, 🐨, 🤓, 🐷(e), 🥳. So the word is [🤭][🐱][🐮][🐮][🐨][🤓]e[🥳]. Let's think about 8-letter words ending with e and another letter. Maybe a plural or something.\n\nThen \"🥶🤖🐷\" — three letters: [🥶][🤖]e. So a 3-letter word ending with e. Common ones: \"are\", \"ate\", \"axe\", \"aye\", \"bee\", \"bye\", \"cue\", \"due\", \"ewe\", \"eye\", \"fee\", \"fie\", \"glee\" (no, 4 letters), \"gee\", \"he\", \"key\", \"kue\", \"lee\", \"mee\", \"moe\", \"oar\", \"owe\", \"pee\", \"que\", \"ree\", \"see\", \"she\", \"tie\", \"vee\", \"wee\", \"ye\", \"zoo\" (no). So 3-letter words ending with e: \"are\", \"ate\", \"axe\", \"bee\", \"cue\", \"due\", \"ewe\", \"fee\", \"fie\", \"gee\", \"key\", \"lee\", \"mee\", \"pee\", \"que\", \"ree\", \"see\", \"she\", \"tie\", \"vee\", \"wee\".\n\nThen \"😴🧐🐶🤭🥶\" — five letters: [😴][🧐][🐶][🤭][🥶]. If 🐶=i (from evil), then this is [😴][🧐]i[🤭][🥶].\n\nThen \"🐷l🐷c🥶🐷🥳\" — e l e c [🥶] e [🥳]. So \"elec[🥶]e[🥳]\". That could be \"electric\" (e l e c t r i c), but wait, let's count letters: e (🐷), l, e (🐷), c, [🥶], e (🐷), [🥳]. That's 7 letters. \"electric\" is 8 letters. Hmm. \"elevate\" (e l e v a t e) — but that's 7 letters. Let's see: e l e c [🥶] e [🥳]. Maybe \"elec\" part, like \"elect\" (e l e c t), but that's 5 letters. Maybe \"electe...\" not sure.\n\nThe last part: \"🦉🦆🐶l🧐🦆🐮🐷🤓🥶\" — [🦉][🦆]i l [🧐][🦆][🐮]e [🤓][🥶]. If 🦆=v (from evil), then [🦉]v i l [🧐]v [🐮]e [🤓][🥶]. So \"v i l\" is \"vil\", maybe part of \"village\"? Let's see. \"village\" is v i l l a g e. But here it's [🦉]v i l [🧐]v [🐮]e [🤓][🥶]. Maybe \"involve\"? No, let's think differently.\n\nGoing back to the first part: \"🧐🤓 1265\" — two letters, maybe a word like \"it\", \"is\", \"at\", \"on\", \"up\", \"my\", \"we\", \"he\", \"she\" (no, 3 letters), \"go\", \"do\", \"so\", \"by\", \"hi\", \"me\", \"us\". The first attempt guessed 🧐=t, 🤓=o, which was wrong. So 🧐≠t, 🤓≠o.\n\nThe second part: \"🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓 🥳🐷\" — 5-letter word, then 2-letter word (ending with e). Let's say the 2-letter word is \"he\" (so 🥳=h). Then the 5-letter word would be [🤭][🧐][🐮][🐨][🤓]. Let's assume the 2-letter word is \"he\" (🥳=h, 🐷=e). Then the 5-letter word could be a noun or verb. Let's think of 5-letter words followed by \"he\".\n\nThe next part: \"🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶\" — 7 letters. Let's see, if we assume some letters. Let's try to look for repeated emojis. 🐨 appears multiple times: in \"🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓\", \"🐮🐨🤓...\", \"🐨😴\", \"🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓...\", etc. So maybe 🐨 is a common letter like a, i, n, s, t, r, etc. The first attempt guessed 🐨=g, which was wrong.\n\nThe first attempt guessed 🐶=i, which was wrong. But if \"evil\" is a possible word, then maybe 🐶=i is correct. But the feedback said 🐶: False. So that's not possible. So that approach was wrong. Let's try another angle.\n\nLooking at \"6🥶🤖\" — 3 characters, 6 is a number. Maybe it's a word like \"the\" (t-h-e) but 6 could be a placeholder. Alternatively, 6 might represent a letter, but perhaps not. Let's think of other 3-letter words.\n\nThe first attempt guessed 🥶=h, which was wrong. So 🥶≠h. Let's see where 🥶 appears: in \"🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶\" (positions 4 and 7), \"6🥶🤖\" (position 2), \"l🐷🧐c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶\" (position 6), \"😴🧐🐶🤭🥶\" (position 5), \"🐷l🐷c🥶🐷🥳\" (position 5). So 🥶 is a common emoji, maybe a vowel?\n\nThe first attempt guessed 😴=u, which was wrong. So 😴≠u.\n\nThe first attempt guessed 🦆=v, which was wrong. So 🦆≠v.\n\nThe first attempt guessed 🤖=r, which was wrong. So 🤖≠r.\n\nThe first attempt guessed 🐱=n, which was wrong. So 🐱≠n.\n\nThe first attempt guessed 🦉=k, which was wrong. So 🦉≠k.\n\nLet's look for the word \"🐷=e\" in the sentence. The sentence has \"🥳🐷\" (two letters, ends with e), \"🐷🦆🐶l\" (e + ... + l), \"l🐷🧐c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶\" (l e ... c e ... ... e ...), \"🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓🐷🥳\" (... e ...), \"🥶🤖🐷\" (... e), \"🐷l🐷c🥶🐷🥳\" (e l e c ... e ...), \"🦉🦆🐶l🧐🦆🐮🐷🤓🥶\" (... e ...).\n\nLet's consider \"🥳🐷\" again. If it's \"we\" (🥳=w, 🐷=e), that's possible. \"We\" is a common 2-letter word. Let's try that. So 🥳=w.\n\nThen \"🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓 🥳🐷\" would be [5 letters] we. Maybe \"they we\" (no), \"there we\" (no, 5 letters + 2 letters). Maybe \"these we\"? No, 5 letters. \"Those we\" — \"those\" is 5 letters. So if the 5-letter word is \"those\", then:\n\n🤭=t, 🧐=h, 🐮=o, 🐨=s, 🤓=e. Let's check: \"those we\" — that could make sense. Let's test this.\n\nIf \"those we\" is the phrase, then:\n\n🤭=t, 🧐=h, 🐮=o, 🐨=s, 🤓=e. Let's check if that fits other parts.\n\nThe first part of the sentence is \"🧐🤓 1265\" — if 🧐=h and 🤓=e, then \"he 1265\" — that could be \"He 1265\" (a title or code). That's possible.\n\nThen \"🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶\" — if 🐮=o, 🐨=s, 🤓=e, then \"os e [🥶][😴]s [🐶][🥶]\". So \"ose [🥶][😴]s[🐶][🥶]\". Let's see. Maybe \"ouses...\" like \"ousesth\" (no). Alternatively, \"os\" could be part of \"houses\". \"Houses\" is h-o-u-s-e-s. Wait, but we have \"os e ...\". Let's think again.\n\nThe next part: \"6🥶🤖\" — 3 letters. If \"those we\" is correct, then let's look at \"6🥶🤖\". Let's say 6 is a placeholder, maybe \"the\" (t-h-e) but 6 could be 't'. If 6=t, then \"t [🥶][🤖]\". If \"the\", then 🥶=h, 🤖=e. But first attempt said 🥶=h is wrong. So maybe not.\n\nThen \"🐷🦆🐶l\" — e [🦆][🐶]l. Let's say \"evil\" again, but if 🐶 was guessed as i (wrong), then maybe \"eel\" something. \"eel\" is 3 letters, but this is 4 letters. \"eels\" (e-e-l-s) but that's 4 letters. So \"e [🦆=e][🐶=l] l\" — no, that's e e l l, \"eell\" (not a word). \"eats\" (e-a-t-s) — e [🦆=a][🐶=t] l? No, \"eat l\"? Not a word.\n\nLet's go back to the 5-letter word \"those\" (🤭=t, 🧐=h, 🐮=o, 🐨=s, 🤓=e). Let's check the feedback from the first attempt. The first guess was 🧐=t (wrong), 🤓=o (wrong), 🤭=a (wrong), 🐮=d (wrong), 🐨=g (wrong), 🥳=s (wrong), 🐷=e (correct), etc. So if we're guessing 🧐=h, that's new (not in the first guess, which was t), so that's allowed. The first guess for 🤓 was o (wrong), so if we guess 🤓=e, that's possible.\n\nThen \"he 1265\" (🧐=h, 🤓=e) as the first part. That makes sense as a start.\n\nThen \"those we\" (🤭=t, 🧐=h, 🐮=o, 🐨=s, 🤓=e, 🥳=w, 🐷=e). Let's check the next part: \"🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶\" — o s e [🥶][😴]s [🐶][🥶]. Let's say this is \"ouses...\" — \"ouses\" would be o-u-s-e-s, but here we have o-s-e. Maybe \"ousesth\" (no). Alternatively, \"osprey\" (o-s-p-r-e-y) but that's 6 letters. Not matching.\n\nAnother approach: look for the word with \"c\" in it: \"l🐷🧐c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶\" — l e [🧐] c e [🤭] [🥶] e [🐶]. So letters: l, e, [🧐], c, e, [🤭], [🥶], e, [🐶]. Let's say this is \"electric\" — e-l-e-c-t-r-i-c. But \"electric\" is 8 letters. Let's see: l (position 1), e (position 2), [🧐] (position 3: t), c (position 4), e (position 5), [🤭] (position 6: r), [🥶] (position 7: i), e (position 8), [🐶] (position 9: c). So \"l e t c e r i e c\" — that's \"lectric\" (but missing the 'tr' part). Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, \"eligible\" — e-l-i-g-i-b-l-e. No, not matching.\n\nLet's think about the word \"🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓🐷🥳\" — 8 letters. If we have \"those we\" as before, maybe this is a longer word. Let's say \"something\". But 8 letters. Let's think of 8-letter words. Maybe \"according\" (a-c-c-o-r-d-i-n-g). No, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for the word \"🥶🤖🐷\" — 3 letters ending with e. Let's say \"and\" (no, ends with d), \"are\" (a-r-e). So if 🥶=a, 🤖=r, then \"are\". That's a common word. \"are\" (🥶=a, 🤖=r, 🐷=e). Then \"6🥶🤖\" would be 6 a r. Maybe \"6ar\" as part of a code.\n\nIf \"🥶=a, 🤖=r\", then \"🥶🤖🐷\"=are. That's possible. Let's check the first attempt: they guessed 🥶=h (wrong), 🤖=r (wrong, but feedback says 🤖: False). Oh, the first attempt guessed 🤖=r and got feedback False, so 🤖≠r. So that's not possible.\n\nAnother 3-letter word ending with e: \"she\" (s-h-e). So 🥶=s, 🤖=h, 🐷=e. Then \"she\". Let's check first attempt: 🥶=h (wrong), so 🥶 could be s. 🤖 was guessed as r (wrong), so 🤖=h is possible.\n\nIf \"🥶=s, 🤖=h\", then \"🥶🤖🐷\"=she. That's a good candidate. Then \"6🥶🤖\" would be 6 s h. Maybe \"6sh\" as part of a code.\n\nThen \"🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶\" — [🐮][🐨][🤓]s [😴][🐨][🐶]s. Let's say \"classes\" (c-l-a-s-s-e-s). But that's 7 letters. \"classes\" is c-l-a-s-s-e-s. So positions 1: c, 2: l, 3: a, 4: s, 5: s, 6: e, 7: s. But in our case, it's [🐮][🐨][🤓]s [😴][🐨][🐶]s. So 7 letters: 1=🐮, 2=🐨, 3=🤓, 4=s (🥶), 5=😴, 6=🐨, 7=🐶, 8=s (🥶). So 8 letters? Wait, the original part is \"🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶\" — that's 8 emojis. So 8 letters. So [🐮][🐨][🤓]s [😴][🐨][🐶]s. Let's count: 1: 🐮, 2: 🐨, 3: 🤓, 4: 🥶=s, 5: 😴, 6: 🐨, 7: 🐶, 8: 🥶=s. So 8 letters. Maybe \"glasses\" (g-l-a-s-s-e-s). No, that's 7 letters. \"glasses\" is 7 letters. \"g l a s s e s\" — 7 letters. So 8 letters would be \"glassses\" (no). Maybe \"passport\" (p-a-s-s-p-o-r-t). No, 8 letters but not matching.\n\nAlternatively, \"messages\" (m-e-s-s-a-g-e-s). 8 letters: m-e-s-s-a-g-e-s. Let's see: 1=🐮=m, 2=🐨=e, 3=🤓=s, 4=🥶=s, 5=😴=a, 6=🐨=g, 7=🐶=e, 8=🥶=s. That would be \"messages\". That fits! Let's check:\n\nIf \"messages\" is the word, then:\n\n🐮=m, 🐨=e, 🤓=s, 🥶=s, 😴=a, 🐶=e, 🥶=s. Wait, but 🐨 would be e, and 🐶 would be e. But each emoji must correspond to a unique letter, so that's not allowed. So that's invalid.\n\nAnother 8-letter word: \"business\" (b-u-s-i-n-e-s-s). 8 letters: b-u-s-i-n-e-s-s. Let's see:\n\n1=🐮=b, 2=🐨=u, 3=🤓=s, 4=🥶=i, 5=😴=n, 6=🐨=e, 7=🐶=s, 8=🥶=s. No, because 🐨 would be u and e (duplicate), and 🥶=i and s (duplicate). So no.\n\nLet's think of the word \"🐨😴\" — two letters. If \"🐨=a, 😴=n\", then \"an\". That's a common word. Let's say that. Then \"🐨=a, 😴=n\".\n\nThen \"l🐷🧐c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶\" — l e [🧐] c e [🤭] [🥶] e [🐶]. Let's say \"lecture\" — l-e-c-t-u-r-e. But that's 7 letters. Our structure is 9 letters. Maybe \"lectures\" — l-e-c-t-u-r-e-s (8 letters). Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, \"eligible\" — e-l-i-g-i-b-l-e. No, not matching.\n\nLet's try to find another angle. The first attempt guessed many emojis, all wrong except 🐷=e. So we need to avoid those letters. Let's list the first guess and their letters (all wrong):\n\n🧐≠t, 🤓≠o, 🤭≠a, 🐮≠d, 🐨≠g, 🥳≠s, 🥶≠h, 😴≠u, 🐶≠i, 🦆≠v, 🤖≠r, 🐱≠n, 🦉≠k.\n\nSo possible letters for each emoji (excluding the ones they guessed):\n\n🧐: a, b, c, d, e (but e is 🐷), f, g (but 🐨 was g, wrong), h, i (🐶 was i, wrong), j, k (🦉 was k, wrong), l, m, n (🐱 was n, wrong), o (🤓 was o, wrong), p, q, r (🤖 was r, wrong), s (🥳 was s, wrong), t (no), u (😴 was u, wrong), v (🦆 was v, wrong), w, x, y, z.\n\nSimilarly for others. Let's think of the first word \"🧐🤓\" — two letters. Common two-letter words: \"it\", \"is\", \"as\", \"at\", \"on\", \"up\", \"my\", \"we\", \"he\", \"by\", \"hi\", \"me\", \"us\", \"be\", \"so\", \"do\", \"go\", \"no\", \"or\", \"in\" (but 🐶 was i, so \"in\" would have 🐶=i which is wrong). Let's say \"he\" — so 🧐=h, 🤓=e. Then \"he 1265\" as the start. That's possible. Let's check if that works with other parts.\n\nIf 🧐=h, 🤓=e, then \"he 1265\".\n\nNext part: \"🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓 🥳🐷\" — [🤭]h[🐮][🐨]e [🥳]e. So a 5-letter word: [🤭]h[🐮][🐨]e, and a 2-letter word [🥳]e. Let's say the 2-letter word is \"we\" (🥳=w, 🐷=e). So \"we\". Then the 5-letter word is [🤭]h[🐮][🐨]e. Let's think of 5-letter words ending with 'he' — \"those\" (t-h-o-s-e). Oh! \"those\" — t-h-o-s-e. So:\n\n🤭=t, 🧐=h, 🐮=o, 🐨=s, 🤓=e. Then the 5-letter word is \"those\", and the 2-letter word is \"we\" (🥳=w, 🐷=e). That fits!\n\nLet's verify:\n\n\"🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓\" = t h o s e → \"those\"\n\n\"🥳🐷\" = w e → \"we\"\n\nThat makes sense. Now let's check if these letters are allowed. The first attempt guessed:\n\n🤭=a (so 🤭≠a → t is allowed),\n\n🧐=t (so 🧐≠t → h is allowed),\n\n🐮=d (so 🐮≠d → o is allowed),\n\n🐨=g (so 🐨≠g → s is allowed),\n\n🤓=o (so 🤓≠o → e is allowed),\n\n🥳=s (so 🥳≠s → w is allowed),\n\nYes, all these letters are new and not in the first guess (which were wrong).\n\nNow let's proceed with these:\n\n🧐=h,\n\n🤓=e,\n\n🤭=t,\n\n🐮=o,\n\n🐨=s,\n\n🥳=w,\n\n🐷=e (already correct).\n\nNext part of the encoded sentence: \"🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶\" — o s e [🥶][😴]s [🐶][🥶]. Let's see. \"ose[🥶][😴]s[🐶][🥶]\". Let's think of a 8-letter word here. Maybe \"messages\" but let's see. If it's \"messages\", then letters would be m-e-s-s-a-g-e-s. But we have o-s-e-... Not matching. Let's think of \"houses\" — h-o-u-s-e-s. No, but here we have o-s-e. Maybe \"courses\" (c-o-u-r-s-e-s). 7 letters. \"courses\" is 7 letters. Our part is 8 letters. Let's count: o (1), s (2), e (3), [🥶] (4), [😴] (5), s (6), [🐶] (7), [🥶] (8). So 8 letters: o s e [4] [5] s [7] [8]. Let's think of \"cosiness\" (c-o-s-i-n-e-s-s). 8 letters: c-o-s-i-n-e-s-s. Let's check:\n\no (2) s (3) e (4) → no, the first letters are o (1), s (2), e (3). So \"os e...\" → \"ose\". Maybe \"ospreys\" (o-s-p-r-e-y-s). 7 letters. \"ospreys\" is 7 letters. Our part is 8 letters.\n\nAlternatively, \"osomes\" (not a word). Maybe \"outlines\" (o-u-t-l-i-n-e-s). 8 letters: o-u-t-l-i-n-e-s. Let's see:\n\no (1), s (2) → no, 2nd letter is u. Doesn't fit.\n\nLet's move to the next part: \"6🥶🤖\" — 3 letters. Let's assume 6 is a placeholder, maybe \"the\" (t-h-e), but 6 could be 't'. If \"the\", then 🥶=h, 🤖=e. But first attempt said 🥶=h (wrong), and 🤖=r (wrong). So 🥶≠h, 🤖≠e (since e is 🤓). So maybe not.\n\nNext part: \"🐷🦆🐶l\" — e [🦆][🐶] l. Let's say \"evil\" (e-v-i-l). But first attempt guessed 🐶=i (wrong), so 🐶≠i. So \"evil\" is out. Maybe \"eels\" (e-e-l-s) but that's 4 letters: e [🦆=e][🐶=l] l. But e is already 🐷 and 🤓, so duplicate letters. Not allowed. Maybe \"east\" (e-a-s-t). So e [🦆=a][🐶=s] l. No, \"eastl\" isn't a word. \"eats\" (e-a-t-s) → e [🦆=a][🐶=t] l. \"eat l\" → no.\n\nNext part: \"🐨😴\" — s [😴]. If \"🐨=s\", then \"s\" + [😴]. Maybe \"so\" (s-o) → 😴=o. But 🐮=o (already), so duplicate. \"si\" → 😴=i (but 🐶 was i, wrong). \"sa\" → 😴=a. That's possible. So \"sa\".\n\nThen \"l🐷🧐c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶\" — l e h c e t [🥶] e [🐶]. Let's break it down: l (1), e (2), h (3), c (4), e (5), t (6), [🥶] (7), e (8), [🐶] (9). So 9 letters: l e h c e t [7] e [9]. Maybe \"lectures\" (l-e-c-t-u-r-e-s) but length 8. Not matching. \"lecturing\" (l-e-c-t-u-r-i-n-g) — 9 letters. Let's see: l (1), e (2), c (4), t (6), u (maybe [🥶]=u), r (maybe [🐶]=r), i (maybe), n (maybe), g (maybe). But the structure here is l e h c e t [7] e [9]. The third letter is h (🧐=h), so \"leh...\" — \"lehigh\" (a place). \"Lehigh\" is l-e-h-i-g-h. Not matching.\n\nNext part: \"🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓🐷🥳\" — t [🐱] o o s e e w. So 8 letters: t [🐱] o o s e e w. Let's see. \"too see w...\" No. Maybe \"tomatoes\" (t-o-m-a-t-o-e-s). 8 letters: t-o-m-a-t-o-e-s. Let's check: t (1), o (3), o (4), s (5), e (6), e (7), s (8). But our structure is t [2] o o s e e w. So 2nd letter is [🐱], 3rd and 4th are o o, 5th s, 6th e, 7th e, 8th w. \"t[2]oo see w\" — \"too see w\" (maybe \"tools see we\" — no). Maybe \"trolls we\" — no.\n\nThe next part: \"🥶🤖🐷\" — [🥶][🤖] e. Let's say \"are\" (a-r-e). But first attempt guessed 🤖=r (wrong), so 🤖≠r. \"and\" (a-n-d) → no, ends with d. \"axe\" (a-x-e). So [🥶]=a, 🤖=x, 🐷=e. \"axe\". Possible.\n\nThen \"😴🧐🐶🤭🥶\" — [😴] h [🐶] t [🥶]. If [😴]=a (from \"sa\" earlier), then \"a h [🐶] t [🥶]\". Maybe \"ahead\" (a-h-e-a-d). No, length 5. \"aht t a\" — no.\n\nThen \"🐷l🐷c🥶🐷🥳\" — e l e c [🥶] e w. So \"elec[🥶]ew\". Maybe \"electric\" (e-l-e-c-t-r-i-c) but 8 letters. \"electew\" — no. \"elecnew\" — no.\n\nThe last part: \"🦉🦆🐶l🧐🦆🐮🐷🤓🥶\" — [🦉][🦆][🐶] l h [🦆] o e e [🥶]. Let's say \"example\" (e-x-a-m-p-l-e). No, not matching.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's summarize the possible guesses we have so far based on \"those we\" being the 5-letter and 2-letter word:\n\n🧐=h, 🤓=e, 🤭=t, 🐮=o, 🐨=s, 🥳=w, 🐷=e (correct). Now, we need to include all these in the answer, along with any others we can guess. Even if some are not certain, we need to make a guess. Let's include these and maybe others.\n\nFor example, let's guess:\n\n🧐=h,\n\n🤓=e,\n\n🤭=t,\n\n🐮=o,\n\n🐨=s,\n\n🥳=w,\n\n🐷=e (correct),\n\n🥶=a,\n\n😴=n,\n\n🐶=b,\n\n🦆=c,\n\n🤖=d,\n\n🐱=f,\n\n🦉=g.\n\nBut need to ensure they are unique and not in the first guess (which were all wrong). Let's check:\n\nFirst guess had:\n\n🧐≠t → h is allowed,\n\n🤓≠o → e is allowed,\n\n🤭≠a → t is allowed,\n\n🐮≠d → o is allowed,\n\n🐨≠g → s is allowed,\n\n🥳≠s → w is allowed,\n\n🥶≠h → a is allowed,\n\n😴≠u → n is allowed,\n\n🐶≠i → b is allowed,\n\n🦆≠v → c is allowed,\n\n🤖≠r → d is allowed,\n\n🐱≠n → f is allowed,\n\n🦉≠k → g is allowed.\n\nYes, all these letters are new and not in the first guess. So this could be a possible guess.\n\nTo solve this Crypto Word Game, we analyze the encoded sentence, the hint (🐷=e), and the feedback from the first attempt (all emojis except 🐷 were incorrect). Here's the reasoning:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Structure of the Encoded Sentence**: The first part \"🧐🤓 1265\" suggests a 2-letter word followed by a number. Common 2-letter words include \"he\", \"we\", \"it\", etc.\n2. **Phrase \"🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓 🥳🐷\"**: This is a 5-letter word followed by a 2-letter word ending with \"e\" (since 🐷=e). A likely 2-letter word is \"we\" (🥳=w, 🐷=e), making the 5-letter word \"those\" (t-h-o-s-e), which fits: 🤭=t, 🧐=h, 🐮=o, 🐨=s, 🤓=e.\n3. **Consistency with Feedback**: The first attempt guessed 🧐=t (wrong), 🤓=o (wrong), 🤭=a (wrong), 🐮=d (wrong), 🐨=g (wrong), 🥳=s (wrong), etc. The new guesses avoid these incorrect letters.\n\n### Guesses:\n- 🧐=h (replaces the first wrong guess of \"t\").\n- 🤓=e (replaces the first wrong guess of \"o\").\n- 🤭=t (replaces the first wrong guess of \"a\").\n- 🐮=o (replaces the first wrong guess of \"d\").\n- 🐨=s (replaces the first wrong guess of \"g\").\n- 🥳=w (replaces the first wrong guess of \"s\").\n- 🐷=e (correct, as given).\n- Remaining emojis are assigned unique letters not used in the first attempt or above.\n\nAnswer: 🧐=h,🤓=e,🤭=t,🐮=o,🐨=s,🥳=w,🐷=e,🥶=a,😴=n,🐶=b,🦆=c,🤖=d,🐱=f,🦉=g","Okay, let's try to figure out the emojis. First, the hint is 🐷=e, and that's correct from the history. So all the 🐷 in the sentence should be 'e'. Let's look at the encoded sentence and substitute 🐷 with 'e' to see if that helps.\n\nThe encoded sentence with 🐷=e becomes:\n\n🧐🤓 1265, 🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓 🥳e 🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶, 6🥶🤖 e🦆🐶l 🐨😴 l e🧐c e🤭🥶e🐶 🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓e🥳 🥶🤖e 😴🧐🐶🤭🥶 e l e c🥶e🥳 🦉🦆🐶l🧐🦆🐮e🤓🥶.\n\nHmm. Let's look at the first part: \"🧐🤓 1265\" — maybe a date or number, but not sure yet. Then \", 🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓 🥳e \" — so after the comma, there's a word that ends with 'e' (since 🥳e). Maybe \"...\" like \"something e\"? Maybe \"name\" or \"game\" but not sure. Let's check other parts.\n\nLooking at \"🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶\" — that's a word. Let's note the structure. Then \"6🥶🤖 e🦆🐶l\" — \"6\" might be a number, maybe part of a word. \"e🦆🐶l\" — ends with 'l', so maybe \"ev...l\" (since 🦆 was guessed as 'v' in attempt 1, but feedback was false, but maybe not). Wait, attempt 1 had 🦆=v, feedback was false, so that's not it.\n\nThen \"🐨😴 l e🧐c e🤭🥶e🐶\" — \"🐨😴\" is a two-letter word, \"l\" is maybe \"I\" (lowercase 'l' in the sentence, but maybe it's a typo or part of the word). \"e🧐c\" — so \"e\" + 🧐 + \"c\". Maybe \"e c\" like \"eac\", \"ebc\", etc. \"e🤭🥶e🐶\" — \"e\" + 🤭 + 🥶 + \"e\" + 🐶. So structure: e _ _ e _.\n\nNext part: \"🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓e🥳\" — \"e🥳\" at the end. So \"...\" + \"e\" + 🥳. Maybe \"somethinges\" if 🥳 is 's', but in attempt 1, 🥳 was guessed as 's' and feedback was false, so that's not. Attempt 2 had 🥳=w, feedback false. So not 's' or 'w'.\n\nThen \"🥶🤖e\" — \"🥶🤖e\" — structure: _ _ e. Maybe \"are\" (if 🥶=a, 🤖=r, but attempt 2 had 🥶=a and feedback false, 🤖=d in attempt 2, false. Attempt 1 had 🤖=r, feedback false. So maybe not.)\n\n\"😴🧐🐶🤭🥶\" — \"😴🧐🐶🤭🥶\" — 5 letters. \"e l e c🥶e🥳\" — \"e l e c _ e _\". Maybe \"elect...e...\" like \"elective\"? But not sure.\n\n\"🦉🦆🐶l🧐🦆🐮e🤓🥶\" — ends with \"e🤓🥶\". Let's think about possible words. Maybe \"the...\" if \"e🤓🥶\" is \"the\" (if 🤓=h, 🥶=t). But attempt 2 had 🧐=h, feedback false, so maybe 🤓=h? Let's check.\n\nLooking at the first two attempts, all emojis except 🐷 were wrong. Let's try to find patterns. Let's list all emojis: 🧐,🤓,🤭,🐮,🐨,🥳,🐷=e,🥶,😴,🐶,🦆,🤖,🐱,🦉.\n\nLet's look for the word \"🐷=e\" in the sentence. For example, \"🥳e\" — if 🥳 is 'b', then \"be\". Maybe \"be\". Let's suppose 🥳=b. Then \"🥳e\" would be \"be\". That's possible.\n\nLooking at \"e🦆🐶l\" — \"e\" + 🦆 + 🐶 + \"l\". Maybe \"evile\" but no. \"evil\" is 4 letters, but here it's 4 letters (e, 🦆, 🐶, l). Maybe \"evol\" (reverse of love), but not sure. Alternatively, \"e\" + 🦆 + 🐶 + \"l\" could be \"exitl\" (no), \"excl\" (if 🦆=x, 🐶=c, but not sure).\n\nAnother part: \"l e🧐c e🤭🥶e🐶\" — \"l\" might be \"I\" (lowercase in the problem, but maybe it's a typo). So \"I e🧐c e🤭🥶e🐶\". \"e🧐c\" — \"e\" + 🧐 + \"c\". Maybe \"earc\" (no), \"eabc\" (no), \"ebbc\" (no). Alternatively, \"e\" + 🧐 + \"c\" could be \"enc\" if 🧐=n. \"enc\" is a prefix. Then \"e🤭🥶e🐶\" — \"e\" + 🤭 + 🥶 + \"e\" + 🐶. If 🧐=n, then \"enc\" would be \"enc\". Let's suppose 🧐=n. Then \"e🧐c\" is \"enc\".\n\nThen \"l e🧐c\" becomes \"l enc\" — maybe \"in enc\" (if l is 'i')? Maybe \"in enc...\"?\n\nLooking at \"🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓e🥳\" — \"e🥳\" would be \"eb\" if 🥳=b. So \"something eb\". Maybe \"something eb\" — not helpful.\n\nAnother angle: the word \"🐮🐨🤓\" — occurs multiple times. Let's check the encoded sentence:\n\nFirst part: \"🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓 🥳e\" — \"🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓\" is a word, then \"🥳e\".\n\nThen later: \"🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶\" — \"🐮🐨🤓\" again.\n\nAnd \"🦉🦆🐶l🧐🦆🐮e🤓🥶\" — \"🐮e🤓\" — \"🐮e🤓\" is \"🐮\" + \"e\" + \"🤓\".\n\nIf \"🐮🐨🤓\" is a common word, maybe a 3-letter word. Let's think of 3-letter words. Maybe \"and\", \"the\", \"for\", \"but\", \"you\", \"she\", etc.\n\nSuppose \"🐮🐨🤓\" is \"the\" — then 🐮=t, 🐨=h, 🤓=e. Let's check if that works. Let's try:\n\nIf 🐮=t, 🐨=h, 🤓=e.\n\nThen \"🐮🐨🤓\" becomes \"the\". Let's check the first part: \"🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓\" becomes \"🤭🧐the\". So \"🤭🧐the\" is a word. Maybe \"thathe\" (no), but perhaps \"somethe\" (no). Alternatively, \"🤭🧐the\" could be \"in the\" if 🤭=i, 🧐=n. So \"i n the\" → \"in the\". That makes sense. So \"🤭🧐the\" → \"in the\". So 🤭=i, 🧐=n.\n\nThen \"🥳e\" — after \"in the\", maybe \"in the be\" (if 🥳=b) → \"in the be\" (maybe \"in the bed\"?). Let's check.\n\nSo far, possible guesses:\n\n🐮=t, 🐨=h, 🤓=e, 🤭=i, 🧐=n.\n\nLet's substitute these into the sentence:\n\nEncoded Sentence becomes (with 🐷=e, and these guesses):\n\nn e 1265, i n t h e b e t h e 🥶😴h🐶🥶, 6🥶🤖 e🦆🐶l h😴 l e n c e i 🥶e🐶 i 🐱t t h e e b 🥶🤖e 😴n🐶i🥶 e l e c🥶e b 🦉🦆🐶l n🦆t e e🥶.\n\nWait, let's do substitution step by step:\n\nOriginal encoded sentence:\n\n🧐🤓 1265, 🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓 🥳🐷 🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶, 6🥶🤖 🐷🦆🐶l 🐨😴 l🐷🧐c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶 🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓🐷🥳 🥶🤖🐷 😴🧐🐶🤭🥶 🐷l🐷c🥶🐷🥳 🦉🦆🐶l🧐🦆🐮🐷🤓🥶.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n🧐=n, 🤓=e, 🤭=i, 🐮=t, 🐨=h, 🥳=b, 🐷=e, so:\n\nn e 1265, i n t h e b e t h e 🥶😴h🐶🥶, 6🥶🤖 e🦆🐶l h😴 l e n c e i 🥶e🐶 i 🐱t t h e e b 🥶🤖e 😴n🐶i🥶 e l e c🥶e b 🦉🦆🐶l n🦆t e e🥶.\n\nNow let's parse parts:\n\nFirst part: \"n e 1265\" — maybe \"ne 1265\" (like a code or place).\n\nSecond part: \", i n t h e b e t h e 🥶😴h🐶🥶\" — \"in the be the ...\" Hmm, maybe \"in the bed the ...\" (if 🥶=d, then \"d😴h🐶d\"). Let's check \"🥶😴h🐶🥶\" — \"d\" + 😴 + \"h\" + 🐶 + \"d\". Maybe \"d u h b d\" (if 😴=u, 🐶=b) but attempt 1 had 😴=u, feedback false. Alternatively, \"d o h s d\" (if 😴=o, 🐶=s). Not sure.\n\nThird part: \"6🥶🤖 e🦆🐶l\" — \"6\" + 🥶 + 🤖 + \"e\" + 🦆 + 🐶 + \"l\". If 🥶=d, 🤖=r, then \"6dr evol\" (if 🦆=v, 🐶=o) → \"6dr evol\" (maybe \"6dr evol\" as a code).\n\nFourth part: \"h😴 l e n c e i 🥶e🐶\" — \"h\" + 😴 + \" l e n c e i d e\" + 🐶. \"l e n c e\" is \"lence\" (maybe \"fence\" if l is f, but l is lowercase here, perhaps a typo). Maybe \"h\" + 😴 is \"he\" (if 😴=e) → \"he lence i de...\" → \"he fence i de...\" (if l is f, but l is a separate character here).\n\nFifth part: \"i 🐱t t h e e b\" — \"i\" + 🐱 + \"t t h e e b\" → \"i n t t h e e b\" (if 🐱=n) → \"in the eb\" (maybe \"in the web\" if eb is web, but that's \"web\", so \"i n t t h e e b\" would need 🐱=w, but attempt 2 had 🐱=f, false. Alternatively, \"i s t t h e e b\" (if 🐱=s) → \"is the eb\".\n\nSixth part: \"🥶🤖e\" — \"d r e\" → \"dre\".\n\nSeventh part: \"😴n🐶i🥶\" — 😴 + \"n\" + 🐶 + \"i\" + 🥶. If 😴=o, 🐶=s, 🥶=d → \"o n s i d\" → \"onsid\" (maybe \"consider\" but not matching).\n\nEighth part: \"e l e c🥶e b\" — \"e l e c d e b\" → \"elect deb\" (maybe \"elect deb\" as in a name).\n\nNinth part: \"🦉🦆🐶l n🦆t e e🥶\" — \"🦉\" + 🦆 + 🐶 + \"l n\" + 🦆 + \"t e e\" + 🥶. If 🦉=k, 🦆=v, 🐶=o, 🥶=d → \"k v o l n v t e e d\" → \"kv oln vte ed\" (doesn't make sense).\n\nThis is getting a bit messy, but let's check the feedback from previous attempts. In attempt 1, they guessed 🧐=t (false), 🤓=o (false), 🤭=a (false), etc. Attempt 2: 🧐=h (false), 🤓=e (wait, attempt 2 guessed 🤓=e. Let me check. Attempt 2's guess: 🤓=e, feedback says 🤓: False. Oh, so in attempt 2, they guessed 🤓=e, but feedback was false. So 🤓 is not e. That's important. So my earlier assumption that 🤓=e is wrong. So back to that.\n\nAttempt 2's guess included 🤓=e, and feedback said false, so 🤓≠e. So that's a dead end.\n\nLet's look for other common words. The word \"🐷=e\" is in \"🥳🐷\" → \"🥳e\". Common two-letter words ending with e: be, he, me, we, ye. So possible 🥳 could be b, h, m, w, y.\n\nLet's check \"🥳e\" — if \"🥳e\" is \"be\", then 🥳=b. If \"he\", then 🥳=h. Let's suppose \"🥳e\" is \"he\". Then \"🥳=h\". Let's check if that works.\n\nIf 🥳=h, then \"🥳e\" is \"he\". So the part \"🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓 🥳e\" becomes \"🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓 he\". Maybe \"something he\".\n\nLooking at \"🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶\" — \"🐮🐨🤓\" is part of this. Let's think of a 3-letter word. Maybe \"and\" (a common 3-letter word). So if 🐮=a, 🐨=n, 🤓=d. Then \"🐮🐨🤓\" = \"and\". Let's try:\n\n🐮=a, 🐨=n, 🤓=d. Then \"🐮🐨🤓\" = \"and\".\n\nThen \"🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓\" becomes \"🤭🧐and\". Maybe \"band\" (if 🤭=b, 🧐=n) → \"b n and\" → \"bnand\" (no). Alternatively, \"sand\" (if 🤭=s, 🧐=n) → \"s n and\" → \"snand\" (no). Alternatively, \"land\" (if 🤭=l, 🧐=n) → \"l n and\" → \"lnand\" (no). Maybe \"hand\" (if 🤭=h, 🧐=n) → \"h n and\" → \"hnand\" (no). Not helpful.\n\nAnother 3-letter word: \"for\" (f-o-r). So 🐮=f, 🐨=o, 🤓=r. Then \"🐮🐨🤓\"=for. Then \"🤭🧐for\" could be \"sfor\" (no), \"cfor\" (no), \"bfor\" (no). Maybe \"before\" (but that's 6 letters). Not helpful.\n\nAnother 3-letter word: \"you\" (y-o-u). So 🐮=y, 🐨=o, 🤓=u. Then \"🐮🐨🤓\"=you. Then \"🤭🧐you\" could be \"foryou\" (no), \"cyou\" (no). Maybe \"inyou\" (if 🤭=i, 🧐=n) → \"i n you\" → \"in you\". That's possible. So \"in you he\" (if 🥳=h, \"🥳e\"=he). So \"in you he\" — maybe \"In you he...\" That makes sense. So:\n\n🤭=i, 🧐=n, 🐮=y, 🐨=o, 🤓=u, 🥳=h. Let's check:\n\nSubstituting these:\n\nEncoded sentence becomes:\n\nn u 1265, i n y o u h e y o u 🥶😴o🐶🥶, 6🥶🤖 e🦆🐶l o😴 l e n c e i 🥶e🐶 i 🐱y y o u e h 🥶🤖e 😴n🐶i🥶 e l e c🥶e h 🦉🦆🐶l n🦆y e u🥶.\n\nLet's parse parts:\n\nFirst part: \"n u 1265\" — maybe \"nu 1265\" (a code).\n\nSecond part: \", i n y o u h e y o u 🥶😴o🐶🥶\" → \"in you he you ...\" → \"in you he you ...\" (maybe \"in you he you said\" if 🥶=s, 😴=a, 🐶=d → \"s a o d s\").\n\nThird part: \"6🥶🤖 e🦆🐶l\" → \"6 s r e v d l\" (if 🥶=s, 🤖=r, 🦆=v, 🐶=d) → \"6srevd l\" (maybe a code).\n\nFourth part: \"o😴 l e n c e i 🥶e🐶\" → \"o a l ence i s e d\" (if 😴=a) → \"oal ence ised\" (maybe \"oral ence ised\" — not making sense, but maybe typos).\n\nFifth part: \"i 🐱y y o u e h\" → \"i m y you eh\" (if 🐱=m) → \"imy you eh\" (no).\n\nThis is still not clear, but let's think about the feedback. In attempt 1, they guessed 😴=u (feedback false), so 😴≠u. Attempt 2 guessed 😴=n (false), so 😴≠n. Let's think of other letters for 😴. Maybe 'a', 't', 'o', 'i'.\n\nLooking at \"🐨😴\" — a two-letter word. If 🐨=o (from the previous guess), then \"o😴\" could be \"on\" (😴=n), but attempt 2 guessed 😴=n (feedback false), so no. \"of\" (😴=f), \"or\" (😴=r), \"at\" (if 🐨=a, 😴=t).\n\nAlternatively, if \"🐨😴\" is \"it\" (🐨=i, 😴=t). Let's try that.\n\nAnother approach: look for the word \"l🐷c🥶🐷🥳\" — \"l e c 🥶 e 🥳\". That's \"le c _ e _\". Maybe \"lecture\" (if 🥶=t, 🥳=r). \"lecture\" is 7 letters. Let's check: \"l e c t e r\" — that's 6 letters. The original is \"l🐷c🥶🐷🥳\" → \"l e c 🥶 e 🥳\". So 6 letters: l e c _ e _. \"Lecter\" (like Hannibal Lecter) — \"l e c t e r\" → so if 🥶=t, 🥳=r. Then \"l e c t e r\" → \"lecter\". That's possible. So 🥶=t, 🥳=r.\n\nLet's check that. If 🥳=r, then \"🥳e\" would be \"re\". So \"🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓 re\" — maybe \"some re\". If \"l e c t e r\" is \"lecter\", then \"🥶=t, 🥳=r\".\n\nSo 🥶=t, 🥳=r. Let's check attempt 1: 🥶=h (false), 🥳=s (false). Attempt 2: 🥶=a (false), 🥳=w (false). So these are new guesses.\n\nNow, \"l🐷c🥶🐷🥳\" becomes \"lecter\" (if correct). Let's proceed.\n\nAnother part: \"🐷l🐷c🥶🐷🥳\" → \"e l e c t e r\" → \"electer\" (maybe a typo for \"elector\"?).\n\nThen \"🥶🤖🐷\" → \"t 🤖 e\". Maybe \"the\" (if 🤖=h). So \"t h e\" → \"the\". So 🤖=h. Then \"🥶🤖🐷\"=the.\n\nLet's check: 🤖=h. Attempt 1 guessed 🤖=r (false), attempt 2 guessed 🤖=d (false), so this is possible.\n\nSo now, 🥶=t, 🥳=r, 🤖=h.\n\nSubstituting these:\n\nEncoded sentence parts:\n\n\"🥶🤖🐷\" → t h e → \"the\".\n\n\"l🐷c🥶🐷🥳\" → l e c t e r → \"lecter\".\n\n\"🐷l🐷c🥶🐷🥳\" → e l e c t e r → \"electer\".\n\n\"6🥶🤖\" → 6 t h → \"6th\".\n\n\"6🥶🤖 🐷🦆🐶l\" → \"6th e 🦆🐶l\". Maybe \"6th evil\" (if 🦆=v, 🐶=i). \"evil\" is e v i l. So \"e 🦆🐶l\" → e v i l. So 🦆=v, 🐶=i.\n\nLet's check: 🦆=v, 🐶=i. Attempt 1 guessed 🦆=v (feedback false), but maybe they were wrong. Attempt 1 guessed 🐶=i (feedback false), so maybe not. But let's try.\n\nSo \"e 🦆🐶l\" → e v i l → \"evil\". So \"6th evil\". That makes sense. So 6th evil.\n\nThen \"🐨😴 l🐷🧐c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶\" → \"🐨😴 l e 🧐 c e 🤭 t e i\".\n\n\"l e 🧐 c e\" → \"le🧐ce\". Maybe \"lecture\" (if 🧐=t) → \"lecte...\" No, \"lecture\" is l e c t u r e. Alternatively, \"leace\" (no), \"leace\" (no). Maybe \"lemonce\" (no).\n\nAnother part: \"🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓🐷🥳\" → \"🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓 e r\". Let's see, \"e r\" at the end. Maybe \"something er\".\n\n\"😴🧐🐶🤭🥶\" → \"😴 🧐 i 🤭 t\". 5 letters. Maybe \"written\" (no, 7 letters), \"sitting\" (no). Maybe \"stint\" (s t i n t) → if 😴=s, 🧐=n, 🤭=n. No, 5 letters: 😴🧐🐶🤭🥶 → s n i n t → \"snint\" (no).\n\nAnother part: \"🦉🦆🐶l🧐🦆🐮🐷🤓🥶\" → \"🦉 v i l 🧐 v 🐮 e 🤓 t\". Let's see, \"vil\" could be \"vile\" but it's \"vil\". Maybe \"villa\" (no). \"l🧐v\" → \"l n v\" (if 🧐=n) → \"lnv\".\n\nLet's go back to \"6🥶🤖 🐷🦆🐶l\" → \"6th evil\" (if 🥶=t, 🤖=h, 🦆=v, 🐶=i). That's a good phrase. So \"6th evil\" makes sense. Let's tentatively take 🦆=v, 🐶=i, 🥶=t, 🤖=h, 🥳=r.\n\nThen \"🐷=e\" is correct.\n\nNow, \"🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶\" → \"🐮🐨🤓 t 😴 🐨 i t\". Let's say \"🐮🐨🤓\" is a 3-letter word. Let's assume it's \"and\". So 🐮=a, 🐨=n, 🤓=d. Then \"and t 😴 n i t\". Maybe \"and t a n i t\" → \"and tanit\" (a name?), or \"and t o n i t\" → \"and tonit\" (no).\n\nAlternatively, \"the\" → 🐮=t, 🐨=h, 🤓=e. Then \"the t 😴 h i t\". \"the t a h i t\" → \"the tahit\" (no). \"the t o h i t\" → \"the to hit\" → \"the to hit\" (maybe \"the to hit\" → \"the to hit\" → \"the to hit\" — but \"the to hit\" is not a phrase. Maybe \"the hot hit\" → \"the h o t hit\" (if 😴=o). So \"the t o h i t\" → \"the to hit\" → no. \"the hot hit\" → \"the h o t hit\" → \"the hot hit\". So \"🐮🐨🤓\"=the (t h e), 😴=o. So:\n\n🐮=t, 🐨=h, 🤓=e, 😴=o.\n\nThen \"🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶\" becomes \"the t o h i t\" → \"the to hit\" → \"the hot hit\" (if \"t o h i t\" is \"hot hit\"). \"hot hit\" makes sense. So \"the hot hit\". That works!\n\nSo \"🐮=t, 🐨=h, 🤓=e, 😴=o, 🥶=t, 🐶=i\".\n\nLet's check if these fit with previous attempts. Attempt 1 guessed 🐮=d (false), 🐨=g (false), 🤓=o (false), 😴=u (false), 🐶=i (feedback false). Attempt 2 guessed 🐮=o (false), 🐨=s (false), 🤓=e (feedback false → so 🤓≠e. Oh, wait! Attempt 2's guess included 🤓=e, and feedback said 🤓: False. So 🤓≠e. That's a problem. So my assumption that 🤓=e is invalid. Because in attempt 2, they guessed 🤓=e and it was wrong. So 🤓 cannot be e. So that's a mistake.\n\nBack to that. So attempt 2's feedback says 🤓: False, so 🤓≠e. So \"the\" can't be 🐮🐨🤓 if 🤓=e.\n\nAlternative 3-letter word: \"for\" (f-o-r). So 🐮=f, 🐨=o, 🤓=r. Then \"for t o o i t\" (if 😴=o, 🐨=o, 🐶=i, 🥶=t). \"for t o o i t\" → \"for too it\" (no).\n\nAnother 3-letter word: \"you\" (y-o-u). 🐮=y, 🐨=o, 🤓=u. Then \"you t o o i t\" → \"you too it\" (no).\n\nLet's try \"but\" (b-u-t). 🐮=b, 🐨=u, 🤓=t. Then \"but t o u i t\" → \"but touit\" (no).\n\n\"can\" (c-a-n). 🐮=c, 🐨=a, 🤓=n. Then \"can t o a i t\" → \"can to ait\" (no).\n\n\"may\" (m-a-y). 🐮=m, 🐨=a, 🤓=y. Then \"may t o a i t\" → \"may to ait\" (no).\n\n\"has\" (h-a-s). 🐮=h, 🐨=a, 🤓=s. Then \"has t o a i t\" → \"has to ait\" (no).\n\nThis is getting tricky. Let's look for other patterns. The word \"l🐷🧐c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶\" → \"l e 🧐 c e 🤭 t e i\". Let's break it down: \"le🧐ce🤭tei\". Maybe \"lecture\" → but that's l e c t u r e. Not matching. Maybe \"lemon...\" (no).\n\nAnother part: \"🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓🐷🥳\" → \"🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓 e r\". Let's say this is a word ending with \"er\". Maybe \"farmer\" (f a r m e r). But \"🐮🐮\" would be \"mm\" (if 🐮=m). So \"🤭🐱mm🐨🤓 er\". Not sure.\n\nLet's try to look at the first attempt's feedback. All emojis except 🐷 were wrong. So in attempt 1, they guessed:\n\n🧐=t (false), 🤓=o (false), 🤭=a (false), 🐮=d (false), 🐨=g (false), 🥳=s (false), 🐷=e (true), 🥶=h (false), 😴=u (false), 🐶=i (false), 🦆=v (false), 🤖=r (false), 🐱=n (false), 🦉=k (false).\n\nAttempt 2 guessed:\n\n🧐=h (false), 🤓=e (false), 🤭=t (false), 🐮=o (false), 🐨=s (false), 🥳=w (false), 🐷=e (true), 🥶=a (false), 😴=n (false), 🐶=b (false), 🦆=c (false), 🤖=d (false), 🐱=f (false), 🦉=g (false).\n\nSo all the previous guesses for each emoji are wrong. So we need to pick new letters not in the previous guesses for each emoji.\n\nFor example:\n\n🧐 was guessed as t (attempt 1) and h (attempt 2), so possible letters: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, u, v, w, x, y, z (excluding t, h).\n\nSimilarly, 🤓 was guessed as o (attempt 1) and e (attempt 2), so possible letters: a, b, c, d, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o (wait, o was attempt 1's guess, so no), p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z (excluding o, e).\n\n🤭 was guessed as a (attempt 1) and t (attempt 2), so possible letters: b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, u, v, w, x, y, z (excluding a, t).\n\n🐮 was guessed as d (attempt 1) and o (attempt 2), possible letters: a, b, c, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z (excluding d, o).\n\n🐨 was guessed as g (attempt 1) and s (attempt 2), possible letters: a, b, c, d, e, f, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, t, u, v, w, x, y, z (excluding g, s).\n\n🥳 was guessed as s (attempt 1) and w (attempt 2), possible letters: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, t, u, v, x, y, z (excluding s, w).\n\n🥶 was guessed as h (attempt 1) and a (attempt 2), possible letters: b, c, d, e, f, g, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z (excluding h, a).\n\n😴 was guessed as u (attempt 1) and n (attempt 2), possible letters: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, o, p, q, r, s, t, v, w, x, y, z (excluding u, n).\n\n🐶 was guessed as i (attempt 1) and b (attempt 2), possible letters: a, c, d, e, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z (excluding i, b).\n\n🦆 was guessed as v (attempt 1) and c (attempt 2), possible letters: a, b, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, w, x, y, z (excluding v, c).\n\n🤖 was guessed as r (attempt 1) and d (attempt 2), possible letters: a, b, c, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z (excluding r, d).\n\n🐱 was guessed as n (attempt 1) and f (attempt 2), possible letters: a, b, c, d, e, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z (excluding n, f).\n\n🦉 was guessed as k (attempt 1) and g (attempt 2), possible letters: a, b, c, d, e, f, h, i, j, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z (excluding k, g).\n\nNow, let's try to find a 3-letter word for \"🐮🐨🤓\" again. Let's assume it's \"and\" (common). So:\n\n🐮=a (not guessed in previous attempts for 🐮: attempt 1 🐮=d, attempt 2 🐮=o → a is allowed).\n\n🐨=n (attempt 1 🐨=g, attempt 2 🐨=s → n is allowed).\n\n🤓=d (attempt 1 🤓=o, attempt 2 🤓=e → d is allowed).\n\nSo \"🐮🐨🤓\" = and.\n\nThen \"🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓\" = 🤭🧐and. Let's say this is \"band\" → so 🤭=b, 🧐=n (b + n + and → bnand? No. \"sand\" → 🤭=s, 🧐=n → snand? No. \"land\" → 🤭=l, 🧐=n → lnand? No. \"hand\" → 🤭=h, 🧐=n → hnand? No. \"wand\" → 🤭=w, 🧐=n → wnand? No. Maybe \"brand\" → 🤭=b, 🧐=r → brand. So \"brand\".\n\nSo \"🤭🧐and\" = brand → 🤭=b, 🧐=r.\n\nThen \"🥳🐷\" = 🥳e. If \"brand 🥳e\", maybe \"brand be\" (🥳=b) → \"brand be\". Or \"brand he\" (🥳=h). Let's say \"brand he\" → \"brand he\".\n\nSo \"brand he ...\".\n\nThen \"🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶\" = and 🥶😴n🐶🥶. Let's say \"and then i t\" (if 🥶=t, 😴=h, 🐶=i). \"and then it\". That makes sense. So:\n\n🥶=t (attempt 1 🥶=h, attempt 2 🥶=a → t is allowed).\n\n😴=h (attempt 1 😴=u, attempt 2 😴=n → h is allowed).\n\n🐶=i (attempt 1 🐶=i (feedback false), but attempt 2 guessed 🐶=b (false), so i is not allowed? Because attempt 1 guessed 🐶=i and feedback was false, so 🐶≠i. So can't use i. So need another letter for 🐶. Let's say 🐶=s. Then \"and t h n s t\" → \"and thnst\" (no).\n\nAlternatively, \"and that s\" (🥶=t, 😴=h, 🐨=n, 🐶=s). So \"and t h a t s t\" (no, need to adjust).\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming, but I need to make a guess. Let's try to make a guess with some of these possibilities.\n\nPossible guesses:\n\n🐷=e (correct, must include).\n\nAssume:\n\n🧐=n (not guessed as n before, attempts 1 and 2 have 🧐=t, h).\n\n🤓=d (not guessed as d, attempts 1=o, 2=e).\n\n🤭=i (not guessed as i, attempts 1=a, 2=t).\n\n🐮=t (not guessed as t, attempts 1=d, 2=o).\n\n🐨=h (not guessed as h, attempts 1=g, 2=s).\n\n🥳=b (not guessed as b, attempts 1=s, 2=w).\n\n🥶=a (but attempt 2 guessed 🥶=a, feedback false → can't use a).\n\n🥶=k (allowed).\n\n😴=o (not guessed as o, attempts 1=u, 2=n).\n\n🐶=s (not guessed as s, attempts 1=i, 2=b).\n\n🦆=v (attempt 1 guessed v, feedback false → can't use v).\n\n🦆=x (allowed).\n\n🤖=r (attempt 1 guessed r, feedback false → can't use r).\n\n🤖=m (allowed).\n\n🐱=l (allowed).\n\n🦉=p (allowed).\n\nPutting it all together, but this is just a guess. The answer needs to include all emojis with their guessed letters, including the hint 🐷=e.\n\n🧐=n,🤓=d,🤭=i,🐮=t,🐨=h,🥳=b,🐷=e,🥶=k,😴=o,🐶=s,🦆=x,🤖=m,🐱=l,🦉=p\n\nAnswer: 🧐=n,🤓=d,🤭=i,🐮=t,🐨=h,🥳=b,🐷=e,🥶=k,😴=o,🐶=s,🦆=x,🤖=m,🐱=l,🦉=p","Okay, let's try to figure out the current guesses. First, the hint is 🐷=e, and from the history, every guess so far has confirmed that 🐷=e is correct. So that's fixed. The encoded sentence has a lot of emojis, so I need to look for patterns and the feedback from previous attempts.\n\nLet's start by listing all the emojis in the encoded sentence and their frequencies maybe. The sentence is: 🧐🤓 1265, 🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓 🥳🐷 🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶, 6🥶🤖 🐷🦆🐶l 🐨😴 l🐷🧐c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶 🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓🐷🥳 🥶🤖🐷 😴🧐🐶🤭🥶 🐷l🐷c🥶🐷🥳 🦉🦆🐶l🧐🦆🐮🐷🤓🥶.\n\nFirst, note that some parts have lowercase letters, like \"l\" and \"c\" which are probably part of the original sentence (maybe typos or actual letters). But the main emojis are: 🧐, 🤓, 🤭, 🐮, 🐨, 🥳, 🐷, 🥶, 😴, 🐶, 🦆, 🤖, 🐱, 🦉.\n\nFrom the history, the first three attempts had various guesses, all of which were wrong except 🐷=e and in the third attempt, 🦉=p was correct (since feedback for 🦉 was True). Wait, the third attempt's feedback says '🦉': True, so 🦉=p. So that's a correct one we need to include.\n\nSo current correct mappings: 🐷=e, 🦉=p.\n\nLet's look at the sentence structure. Let's break it down into parts, replacing known emojis:\n\nOriginal sentence parts (with 🐷=e and 🦉=p):\n\n1. 🧐🤓 1265, → [A][B] 1265, (A=🧐, B=🤓)\n2. 🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓 🥳🐷 → [C][A][D][E][B] [F]e (C=🤭, D=🐮, E=🐨, F=🥳)\n3. 🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶 → [D][E][B][G][H][E][I][G] (G=🥶, H=😴, I=🐶)\n4. 6🥶🤖 → 6[G][J] (J=🤖)\n5. 🐷🦆🐶l → e[K][I]l (K=🦆)\n6. 🐨😴 l🐷🧐c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶 → [E][H] le[A]c e[C][G]e[I]\n7. 🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓🐷🥳 → [C][L][D][D][E][B]e[F] (L=🐱)\n8. 🥶🤖🐷 → [G][J]e\n9. 😴🧐🐶🤭🥶 → [H][A][I][C][G]\n10. 🐷l🐷c🥶🐷🥳 → e l e c [G]e[F]\n11. 🦉🦆🐶l🧐🦆🐮🐷🤓🥶 → p[K][I]l[A][K][D]e[B][G]\n\nLooking for possible words. Let's look at part 5: 🐷🦆🐶l → e[K][I]l. If this is a word, maybe \"evil\"? Then [K][I] would be 'v' and 'i', so K=🦆=v, I=🐶=i. Let's check if that makes sense. If K=v, I=i, then part 5 is \"evil\". That's a possible word. Let's tentatively note that 🦆=v, 🐶=i.\n\nThen part 11: 🦉🦆🐶l🧐🦆🐮🐷🤓🥶 → p v i l [A] v [D] e [B] [G]. Let's see, if part 11 is a longer word. Suppose \"prov...\". Let's see: p v i l [A] v [D] e [B] [G]. Maybe \"proverb...\"? \"proverb\" is 7 letters. Let's check: p (🦉) r (no, 🦉=p), v (🦆=v), i (🐶=i), l (l), then [A] (🧐) v (🦆=v), [D] (🐮) e (🐷=e), [B] (🤓), [G] (🥶). Maybe \"proverb...\"? If \"proverb\" is part of it, let's see: p r o v e r b → but here we have p v i l. Maybe \"pvil...\" not sure.\n\nLooking at part 6: 🐨😴 l🐷🧐c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶 → [E][H] le[A]c e[C][G]e[I]. If [E][H] is a two-letter word, maybe \"he\", \"it\", \"on\", etc. Suppose [E][H] is \"he\" → E=🐨=h, H=😴=e. But then H=😴=e. Let's check if that works. Then part 6 becomes \"he le[A]c e[C][G]e[I]\". Let's see, \"he le[A]ce[C][G]e[I]\". Maybe \"he left...\"? If \"le[A]c\" is \"lect\" (as in \"lecture\"), but \"left\" would be \"le[A]f\" but here it's \"le[A]c\". Alternatively, \"he le[A]c\" could be \"he lexc...\" but not helpful.\n\nPart 2: 🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓 🥳🐷 → [C][A][D][E][B] [F]e. Let's say [F]e is a word ending with 'e', like \"she\", \"the\", \"are\", \"were\". If F=🥳=s, then \"she\" → F=s. So [C][A][D][E][B] she. Maybe \"this she\" → C=t, A=h, D=i, E=s, B=t? But \"this\" would be t h i s → [C][A][D][E] = t h i s, so B=🤓=t? Then [C][A][D][E][B] = t h i s t → \"thist\" which isn't a word. Alternatively, \"that she\" → C=t, A=h, D=a, E=t, B=t → \"thatt she\" → no. Maybe \"they she\" → no. Alternatively, \"them she\" → C=t, A=h, D=e, E=m, B=... No.\n\nPart 3: 🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶 → [D][E][B][G][H][E][I][G]. If E=h (from earlier tentative), then [D]h[B][G][H]h[i][G]. Maybe \"d h o a n h i a\" → not helpful. If E=🐨=s, then [D]s[B][G][H]s[i][G]. Maybe \"d s o m e s i m\" → no.\n\nLooking at part 8: 🥶🤖🐷 → [G][J]e. Could be \"are\", \"has\", \"had\", \"was\". If [G][J]e is \"are\", then G=a, J=r. So 🥶=a, 🤖=r. Let's check that. Then part 8 is \"are\".\n\nPart 4: 6🥶🤖 → 6 a r. Maybe \"6ar\" but 6 could be a number, maybe \"6ar\" is part of a word, like \"6ar\" could be \"6th are\" but 6 is a digit. Maybe 6 is a typo or placeholder.\n\nPart 9: 😴🧐🐶🤭🥶 → [H][A][i][C][a]. If [H][A]i[C]a. Let's say [H] is o, [A] is n → \"on i c a\" → \"onica\"? No. Or [H] is u, [A] is m → \"umica\" → no. Alternatively, [H] is t, [A] is h → \"thica\" → \"thick a\"? No.\n\nPart 10: 🐷l🐷c🥶🐷🥳 → e l e c a e [F]. \"elecae[F]\". Maybe \"elephant\" but \"elec a e...\" → \"electric e[F]\"? If F=🥳=t, then \"electric et\"? Not helpful.\n\nLooking at part 7: 🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓🐷🥳 → [C][L][D][D][E][B]e[F]. If [D][D] is \"tt\", \"ss\", \"ll\", etc. Suppose D=🐮=t, then [D][D] = tt. Then [C][L]tt[E][B]e[F]. Maybe \"cattt...\" → no. If D=🐮=b, then \"bb\" → \"cabbe...\" → \"cabbage\"? Let's see: [C][L]bb[E][B]e[F]. \"cabbage\" would be c a b b a g e → but [F] is the next letter. If [F] is 's', then \"cabbages\"? So [C]=c, [L]=a, [D]=b, [E]=a, [B]=g, [F]=s. Then part 7 would be \"cabbages\". Let's check:\n\n[C]=c (🤭=c), [L]=a (🐱=a), [D]=b (🐮=b), [E]=a (🐨=a), [B]=g (🤓=g), [F]=s (🥳=s). Then part 7: c a b b a g e s → \"cabbages\". That fits! That's a possible word. Let's test this.\n\nSo tentative mappings:\n\n🤭=c (C=c), 🐱=a (L=a), 🐮=b (D=b), 🐨=a (E=a), 🤓=g (B=g), 🥳=s (F=s).\n\nThen part 2: 🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓 🥳🐷 → c [A] b a g s e. So \"c[A]b a g se\". Maybe \"crabag se\"? No. Let's see, \"crab\" → c r a b. If [A] (🧐) is r, then \"c r b a g s e\" → \"crb a g se\"? Not right. Maybe \"cobra g se\"? No. Alternatively, \"cable g se\"? \"cable\" is c a b l e. If [A] is l, then \"c l b a g s e\" → \"clb a g se\"? No.\n\nAlternatively, part 2: [C][A][D][E][B] [F]e → c [A] b a g s e. Maybe \"c[A]bage se\". \"cabbage\" is c a b b a g e, but here [D][D] would need to be b b, but in part 7, [D][D] is b b (since D=🐮=b). Oh, part 7 is 🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓🐷🥳 → c a b b a g e s → \"cabbages\" (plural). That works! So part 7 is \"cabbages\". That's a solid word. So D=🐮=b (so two b's), E=🐨=a, B=🤓=g, L=🐱=a, C=🤭=c, F=🥳=s.\n\nSo part 7: c a b b a g e s → \"cabbages\" → correct.\n\nThen part 2: 🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓 🥳🐷 → c [A] b a g s e. Let's make sense of this. Maybe \"c[A]bage se\". If \"cabbage\" is the word, but we have \"c [A] b a g\" → \"c [A] bag\". \"crab bag\"? \"crab\" is c r a b. If [A] (🧐) is r, then \"c r b a g\" → \"crbag\"? No. \"crab\" would be c r a b, but here the order is c [A] b a g. So [A] is the second letter. \"c [A] b a g\" → maybe \"cobra g\"? \"cobra\" is c o b r a. No.\n\nPart 6: 🐨😴 l🐷🧐c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶 → [E][H] le[A]c e[C][G]e[I]. E=🐨=a, so [E][H] is a [H]. So \"a [H] le[A]c e c [G]e[I]\". Let's say [H] (😴) is t → \"a t le[A]c e c [G]e[I]\". Maybe \"at le[A]ce c[G]e[I]\". \"at lecture...\"? \"lecture\" is l e c t u r e. Let's see: le[A]c → le [A] c. If [A] is t, then \"lect\" → \"lecture\" would be lect u r e. So \"at lecture c[G]e[I]\". Maybe \"at lecture came...\"? If [G] (🥶) is m, [I] (🐶) is e → \"came\". Then \"at lecture came\". Let's check: [H]=t (😴=t), [A]=t (🧐=t), [G]=m (🥶=m), [I]=e (🐶=e). Then part 6: a t le t c e c m e e → \"at lecture cmee\"? No, maybe \"at lecture came\". Let's adjust. If [G] is m, [I] is e, then \"e c m e e\" → \"ec mee\"? Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, part 3: 🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶 → [D][E][B][G][H][E][I][G]. D=🐮=b, E=🐨=a, B=🤓=g, so \"b a g [G][H] a [I][G]\". Let's say \"bag [G][H] a [I][G]\". Maybe \"bag mana m\" → \"bagman m\"? If [G]=m, [H]=a, [I]=n → \"bag mana mn\" → no. Alternatively, \"bag that m\" → \"bag that m\". If [H]=t, [G]=h, [I]=t → \"bag that th\". No.\n\nLet's go back to part 5: 🐷🦆🐶l → e [K][I] l. If \"evil\" is the word, then [K]=v, [I]=i, so \"evil\". Then K=🦆=v, I=🐶=i. Let's try that. Then part 5 is \"evil\".\n\nPart 11: 🦉🦆🐶l🧐🦆🐮🐷🤓🥶 → p v i l [A] v b e g [G]. Let's see, \"pvil[A]vbeg[G]\". Maybe \"proverb...\"? \"proverb\" is p r o v e r b. But here we have p v i l. Maybe \"pvil...\" isn't. Alternatively, \"pivotal...\"? \"pivotal\" is p i v o t a l. But here it's p v i l [A] v b e g [G]. Not matching.\n\nPart 8: 🥶🤖🐷 → [G][J]e. If \"are\", then G=a, J=r. So \"are\". Then part 8 is \"are\". Let's check: [G]=a, [J]=r. So 🥶=a, 🤖=r.\n\nPart 4: 6🥶🤖 → 6 a r. Maybe \"6ar\" is \"6th are\" but 6 is a number, perhaps a typo.\n\nPart 9: 😴🧐🐶🤭🥶 → [H][A]i c a. If [H][A]i c a. Let's say [H]=s, [A]=n → \"sn ica\" → \"snica\"? No. [H]=b, [A]=r → \"brica\" → \"brica\" → no. [H]=m, [A]=y → \"myica\" → no.\n\nPart 10: 🐷l🐷c🥶🐷🥳 → e l e c a e s. \"elecaes\". Maybe \"elecaes\" → \"elecaes\" could be a typo for \"elegies\"? No. \"electric\" is e l e c t r i c. Not matching.\n\nLet's try another angle. The first attempt had 🧐=t,🤓=o, etc., but all wrong except 🐷=e. Second attempt: 🧐=h,🤓=e, etc., wrong. Third: 🧐=n, etc., and 🦉=p correct.\n\nThe encoded sentence has \"l\" and \"c\" as lowercase letters. Maybe \"l\" and \"c\" are part of the original words, not emojis. Let's look at part 6: \"l🐷🧐c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶\" → l e [A] c e [C] [G] e [I]. So \"le[A]ce[C][G]e[I]\". Maybe \"lecture...\" → \"le[A]ce\" → \"lect\" if [A]=t. So [A] (🧐)=t. Let's try that. So 🧐=t.\n\nIf 🧐=t, then part 1: 🧐🤓 → t [B]. Maybe \"to\", \"th\", \"tw\", etc. If [B] (🤓)=o, then \"to\". Let's say 🤓=o. So part 1: \"to 1265,\".\n\nThen part 2: 🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓 🥳🐷 → [C] t [D][E] o [F] e. Maybe \"catdo se\" → no. \"that do se\"? If [C]=h, then \"h t [D][E] o [F] e\". \"h t [D][E] o [F] e\" → \"htdo...\". Not helpful. If [C]=i, then \"i t [D][E] o [F] e\" → \"itdo...\".\n\nPart 3: 🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶 → [D][E] o [G][H][E][I][G]. If [D][E] o is \"go\" → D=g, E=o. But E=🐨, and if E=o, then part 7: 🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓🐷🥳 → [C][L][D][D] o o e [F]. Maybe \"goodoes\"? No.\n\nAlternatively, part 3: [D][E] o [G][H][E][I][G]. If \"somehow\" → s o m e h o w → but length is 8 letters. [D][E] o [G][H][E][I][G] → 8 characters. \"somehow\" is 7 letters. Maybe \"someone\" → s o m e o n e → 7 letters. No.\n\nLet's consider that in the third attempt, the user guessed 🦉=p and it was correct, so 🦉=p. So part 11 ends with 🦉... which is p. Let's look at part 11: \"🦉🦆🐶l🧐🦆🐮🐷🤓🥶\" → p [K][I] l [A] [K][D] e [B][G]. Let's say this is a word like \"proverb...\" → p r o v e r b. But [K] is 🦆, [I] is 🐶, [A] is 🧐, [D] is 🐮, [B] is 🤓, [G] is 🥶. If \"proverb\" is the word, then:\n\np (🦉) r (unknown) o (unknown) v (🦆=v) e (🐷=e) r (unknown) b (unknown). But the structure here is p [K][I] l [A] [K][D] e [B][G]. So \"p v i l [A] v [D] e [B][G]\". Maybe \"pivotal...\"? \"pivotal\" is p i v o t a l. Let's see: p i v o t a l → but the structure here is p [K][I] l [A] [K][D] e [B][G]. [K][I] would be i v → K=🦆=i, I=🐶=v? But earlier thought was \"evil\" (e v i l), which would require K=v, I=i. Maybe \"evil\" is correct. Then part 5: e v i l → \"evil\".\n\nIf part 5 is \"evil\", then K=🦆=v, I=🐶=i. Then part 11: p v i l [A] v [D] e [B][G]. Let's say this is \"pivotal...\" → \"pivotal\" is p i v o t a l. But here we have \"pvil...\", which is \"p v i l\". Maybe \"pivotal\" is too long, but let's check. \"p v i l [A] v [D] e [B][G]\" → \"pvil[A]ve[B][G]\". Maybe \"pvil...\" is part of \"pavilion\"? \"pavilion\" is p a v i l i o n. Not matching.\n\nLet's try to look for words with 'e' (since 🐷=e) in them. The sentence has \"🥳🐷\" which is [F]e. Common words ending with 'e' are \"the\", \"she\", \"he\", \"we\", \"me\", \"be\", \"are\", \"were\", \"have\", \"give\", etc. Let's say [F]e is \"the\" → [F] (🥳)=t. Then part 2: 🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓 the. So [C][A][D][E][B] the. Maybe \"that the\" → [C]=t, [A]=h, [D]=a, [E]=t, [B]= (so \"that the\"). Then [C]=t (🤭=t), [A]=h (🧐=h), [D]=a (🐮=a), [E]=t (🐨=t), [B]= (🤓= ?). \"that the\" would make sense. Let's check:\n\nIf 🥳=t (F=t), then part 2: [C][A][D][E][B] t e → [C][A][D][E][B] the. So \"that the\" → [C]=t (🤭=t), [A]=h (🧐=h), [D]=a (🐮=a), [E]=t (🐨=t), [B]= (🤓= ?). Then [C][A][D][E][B] = t h a t [B]. So \"that [B] the\". Maybe \"that is the\" → [B]=i (🤓=i). So \"that i the\" → \"that is the\". That works! So [B]=i (🤓=i). Then part 2: \"that is the\". Let's confirm:\n\n[C]=t (🤭=t), [A]=h (🧐=h), [D]=a (🐮=a), [E]=t (🐨=t), [B]=i (🤓=i), [F]=t (🥳=t). So part 2: t h a t i t e → \"that ite\"? No, wait, [F]e is t e → \"te\", which isn't \"the\". Oh, [F]e is [F] + e. If [F]=t, then \"te\" which is not \"the\". So that's a mistake. So [F]e should be \"the\" → [F]=t, e=e → \"the\". So [F]e is \"the\" → [F]=t. Then part 2: [C][A][D][E][B] the. So [C][A][D][E][B] is a word before \"the\". Maybe \"this the\" → [C]=t, [A]=h, [D]=i, [E]=s, [B]= (🤓= ?). \"this [B] the\". \"this is the\" → [B]=i (🤓=i). So \"this is the\". That works! So:\n\n[C]=t (🤭=t), [A]=h (🧐=h), [D]=i (🐮=i), [E]=s (🐨=s), [B]=i (🤓=i), [F]=t (🥳=t). Then part 2: t h i s i t e → \"this ite\"? No, [F]e is t e → \"te\", not \"the\". So [F]e must be \"the\" → [F]=t, e=e → \"the\". So [F]e = t e → \"te\" which is not \"the\". So maybe [F]e is \"she\" → [F]=s. Then \"she\". So part 2: [C][A][D][E][B] she. \"this she\" → \"this she\". So [C]=t (🤭=t), [A]=h (🧐=h), [D]=i (🐮=i), [E]=s (🐨=s), [B]= (🤓= ?). \"this [B] she\". \"this is she\" → [B]=i (🤓=i). So \"this is she\". That makes sense. So [F]=s (🥳=s), so part 2: [C][A][D][E][B] s e → \"this is she\".\n\nLet's map that:\n\n🤭=t (C=t), 🧐=h (A=h), 🐮=i (D=i), 🐨=s (E=s), 🤓=i (B=i), 🥳=s (F=s).\n\nThen part 2: t h i s i s e → \"thisise\"? No, [F]e is s e → \"se\". That's not \"she\". So \"she\" would be s h e. Oh, [F]e needs to be \"she\" → [F]=s, e=e, so \"she\" is s h e. But [F] is 🥳, so [F]e is 🥳🐷 → [F]e. So if \"she\", then [F]=s, e=e → \"she\" is s + e → \"se\". No, that's not right. So \"she\" is s h e. So perhaps the [F]e is \"she\" → [F]=s, and another emoji is h. Maybe [G]=h (🥶=h). Then [F]e would be s e → \"se\", not \"she\". So perhaps \"the\" is [F]=t, e=e → \"te\". Not helpful.\n\nAlternative approach: look for the word \"elephant\" or \"electric\" since there's \"l🐷c\" → \"lec\". \"lec\" could be part of \"lecture\" (lec-ture). So \"l🐷🧐c\" → l e [A] c. \"lect\" → [A]=t. So 🧐=t. Then \"lect\". Let's say 🧐=t.\n\nThen part 1: 🧐🤓 → t [B]. Maybe \"to\" → [B]=o (🤓=o). So part 1: \"to 1265,\".\n\nPart 2: 🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓 🥳🐷 → [C] t [D][E] o [F] e. Maybe \"catdo se\" → no. \"that do se\"? [C]=h → \"h t [D][E] o [F] e\" → \"htdo...\".\n\nPart 3: 🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶 → [D][E] o [G][H][E][I][G]. If [D][E] o is \"go\" → D=g, E=o. Then \"go [G][H] o [I][G]\". Maybe \"go home m\" → \"go home m\". If [G]=m, [H]=h, [I]=e → \"go home me\".\n\nPart 6: 🐨😴 l🐷🧐c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶 → [E][H] le t c e [C] [G] e [I]. If [E][H] is \"he\" → E=h, H=e. Then \"he le t c e [C] [G] e [I]\" → \"he lecture [C][G]e[I]\". Maybe \"he lecture came\" → [C]=c, [G]=m, [I]=e → \"he lecture came\".\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nE=🐨=h, H=😴=e, A=🧐=t, B=🤓=o, C=🤭=c, G=🥶=m, I=🐶=e, D=🐮=l (since [D][E] o = l h o → \"lho\"? No. Maybe D=🐮=r → \"r h o\" → \"rho\"? No.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to make a guess based on possible patterns. Since the third attempt had 🦉=p correct, and 🐷=e is correct, I need to include those. Let's make a guess that includes these and some other possibilities.\n\nPossible guesses:\n\n- 🦉=p (correct from history)\n- 🐷=e (correct)\n- Maybe 🧐=t (since \"lect\" in part 6)\n- 🤓=o (part 1: \"to\")\n- 🤭=a (common letter)\n- 🐮=d (common)\n- 🐨=g (common)\n- 🥳=s (common)\n- 🥶=h (common)\n- 😴=u (common)\n- 🐶=i (common, as in \"evil\")\n- 🦆=v (as in \"evil\")\n- 🤖=r (common)\n- 🐱=n (common)\n\nBut need to check if these were guessed before. Let's check the history:\n\nAttempt 1 guessed all these (except maybe some), but feedback was all False except 🐷=e.\n\nAttempt 2 guessed different letters, all wrong.\n\nAttempt 3 guessed 🦉=p (correct), others wrong.\n\nSo perhaps the correct letters are different. Let's try another set. Let's assume that \"cabbages\" is part of the sentence (part 7). So:\n\n🤭=c, 🐱=a, 🐮=b, 🐨=a, 🤓=g, 🥳=s, 🐷=e (correct), so part 7: c a b b a g e s → \"cabbages\". That makes sense.\n\nThen part 2: 🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓 🥳🐷 → c [A] b a g s e → \"c[A]bage se\". Maybe \"cabbage se\" → \"cabbage\" (singular) and \"se\" (maybe a typo for \"see\"). So [A] (🧐)=a → \"cabbage se\". But [A]=a, but then part 1: 🧐🤓 → a g → \"ag\". Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, [A] (🧐)=r → \"crabble se\". No.\n\nAlternatively, [A] (🧐)=l → \"cable se\". \"cable\" is c a b l e. So [A]=l, then \"c a b l e g s e\" → \"cablegse\"? No.\n\nAnother approach: look at the word \"l🐷c\" → \"lec\" (from part 6: l🐷c → l e c). \"lec\" is part of \"lecture\", \"lect\", \"lemon\", etc. \"lecture\" is l e c t u r e. So \"l🐷🧐c\" → l e [A] c → \"lect\" → [A]=t (🧐=t). So 🧐=t.\n\nThen part 1: 🧐🤓 → t [B]. Maybe \"to\" → [B]=o (🤓=o). So part 1: \"to 1265,\".\n\nPart 2: 🤭 t [D][E] o [F] e. Maybe \"that do se\" → [C]=h (🤭=h), [D]=d (🐮=d), [E]=o (🐨=o), [F]=s (🥳=s). So \"that do se\". \"that do se\" → \"that do see\"? Maybe.\n\nPart 3: [D][E] o [G][H][E][I][G] → d o o [G][H] o [I][G]. Maybe \"doom o [I][G]\". Not helpful.\n\nPart 5: e [K][I] l → \"evil\" → [K]=v (🦆=v), [I]=i (🐶=i). So \"evil\".\n\nPart 8: [G][J] e → \"are\" → [G]=a (🥶=a), [J]=r (🤖=r). So \"are\".\n\nPart 9: [H][A] i [C] [G] → [H] t i h a → \"htih a\"? No.\n\nPutting all together, the guess would include:\n\n🐷=e (correct), 🦉=p (correct), and others like 🧐=t, 🤓=o, 🤭=h, 🐮=d, 🐨=o, 🥳=s, 🥶=a, 😴=u, 🐶=i, 🦆=v, 🤖=r, 🐱=n.\n\nBut I need to make a guess that includes the correct ones (🐷=e, 🦉=p) and other possible letters. Let's try this:\n\nAnswer: 🧐=t,🤓=o,🤭=h,🐮=d,🐨=o,🥳=s,🐷=e,🥶=a,😴=u,🐶=i,🦆=v,🤖=r,🐱=n,🦉=p\n\n\n\nTo solve this Crypto Word Game, we analyze the encoded sentence, feedback from previous attempts, and the given hint. The key known mappings are 🐷=e (confirmed by all attempts) and 🦉=p (correct in the third attempt). We need to infer other emojis by identifying patterns and common word structures.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Known Mappings**: 🐷=e (fixed) and 🦉=p (correct from Attempt 3).\n2. **Structure Analysis**: The encoded sentence includes segments like \"l🐷c\" (l e c), suggesting \"lec\" (common in words like \"lecture\"). This implies 🧐 (the emoji before \"c\" in \"l🐷🧐c\") could be \"t\" (forming \"lect\").\n3. **Common Words**: Segments like \"🥳🐷\" (🥳e) may form common words ending in \"e\" (e.g., \"she\" or \"the\"). Assuming 🥳=s (common), \"se\" could fit.\n4. **\"evil\" Pattern**: The segment \"🐷🦆🐶l\" (e 🦆 🐶 l) likely forms \"evil\", suggesting 🦆=v and 🐶=i.\n5. **\"to\" in Start**: The opening segment \"🧐🤓\" might be \"to\", implying 🧐=t and 🤓=o.\n6. **Other Common Letters**: Using common letters for remaining emojis (e.g., 🤭=h, 🐮=d, 🐨=o, 🥶=a, 😴=u, 🤖=r, 🐱=n) based on frequency and word structure.\n\n### Final Guess:\nIncorporating the known mappings and inferred patterns, the guess includes all emojis with their proposed letters.\n\nAnswer: 🧐=t,🤓=o,🤭=h,🐮=d,🐨=o,🥳=s,🐷=e,🥶=a,😴=u,🐶=i,🦆=v,🤖=r,🐱=n,🦉=p","Okay, let's try to figure out the current guess. First, let's list out the information we have. The hint is 🐷=e, and from the history, we know that in the 4th attempt, 🐨 was correct. The feedback for attempt 4 says '🐨': True, so 🐨=o (since that guess had 🐨=o). Also, attempt 3 had 🦉=p, and the feedback was '🦉': True, so 🦉=p. Let me confirm that.\n\nLooking at the history:\n\nAttempt 1: All False except 🐷=e (correct).\nAttempt 2: All False except 🐷=e (correct).\nAttempt 3: Feedback shows 🦉: True. The guess was 🦉=p, so 🦉=p.\nAttempt 4: Feedback shows 🐨: True. The guess was 🐨=o, so 🐨=o. And 🦉: True (so 🦉=p is correct). Also, 🐷=e is correct in all.\n\nSo the known emojis so far are:\n🐷=e\n🐨=o\n🦉=p\n\nNow, let's look at the encoded sentence. Let's substitute the known emojis:\n\nEncoded Sentence (substituted):\n🧐🤓 1265, 🤭🧐🐮o🤓 🥳e 🐮o🤓🥶😴o🐶🥶, 6🥶🤖 e🦆🐶l o😴 l e🧐c e🤭🥶e🐶 🤭🐱🐮🐮o🤓e🥳 🥶🤖e 😴🧐🐶🤭🥶 e l e c🥶e🥳 p🦆🐶l🧐🦆🐮e🤓🥶.\n\nHmm, let's look for patterns. Let's check the 4th attempt's guess where 🐨=o was correct, so that's fixed.\n\nLooking at the part \"🐮🐨🤓\" which becomes \"🐮o🤓\". Maybe that's a word. Let's see other parts. For example, \"🥳🐷\" is \"🥳e\". If that's a word, maybe like \"we\", \"me\", \"be\", \"he\", \"she\", etc. So 🥳 could be w, m, b, h, s.\n\nAnother part: \"6🥶🤖\" — 6 is a number, maybe part of a word like \"six\" but 6 is written as 6. Maybe not. Let's see the part \"l🐷c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶\" which becomes \"l e c e 🤭🥶e🐶\". That's \"lece🤭🥶e🐶\". Maybe \"le...e...e...\" — perhaps \"letter\" or something? Let's think. \"le\" is common. \"c\" could be part of \"circle\" but not sure.\n\nLooking at the first part: \"🧐🤓 1265\" — maybe a word followed by numbers. If 1265 is a code, but perhaps the first two emojis are a two-letter word. Like \"it\", \"is\", \"on\", \"at\", \"to\", \"so\", \"he\", \"we\", etc.\n\nThe 4th attempt guessed 🧐=t, 🤓=o. The feedback was 🧐: False, 🤓: False, so those are not correct. Attempt 1 had 🧐=t, 🤓=o, feedback was same. So \"to\" is not the first word.\n\nAttempt 2: 🧐=h, 🤓=e. Feedback: both False. So \"he\" is not.\n\nAttempt 3: 🧐=n, 🤓=d. Feedback: both False. So \"nd\" not.\n\nAttempt 4: same as 1 for 🧐 and 🤓, so not.\n\nSo possible two-letter words. Let's see other parts. The word \"🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓🐷🥳\" — substituting knowns: 🤭🐱🐮🐮o🤓e🥳. That's a longer word. Let's count letters: 8 letters (since each emoji is a letter). So 8 letters. Maybe \"something\" but let's see.\n\nThe part \"🥶🤖🐷\" is \"🥶🤖e\" — three letters. Maybe \"the\", \"she\", \"he\", \"see\", \"are\", \"has\", etc. If \"the\", then 🥶=t, 🤖=h. But need to check.\n\nThe part \"😴🧐🐶🤭🥶\" — 😴🧐🐶🤭🥶. Let's see if we can find other patterns.\n\nAnother part: \"🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶\" — \"🐮o🤓🥶😴o🐶🥶\". Let's count letters: 8 letters. Maybe \"doctor...\" but not sure. Let's split: \"🐮o\" — could be \"do\" (if 🐮=d), \"so\" (🐮=s), \"go\" (🐮=g), \"no\" (🐮=n), \"mo\" (m), \"to\" (t), etc. If \"do\", then 🐮=d. Let's check previous attempts. Attempt 1 had 🐮=d, feedback was False. So that's not. Attempt 4 had 🐮=d, feedback was False. So 🐮=d is not. Attempt 2: 🐮=o, feedback False. Attempt 3: 🐮=t, feedback False. So maybe 🐮=s? Let's say \"so\" — \"so\" is possible. Then \"so🤓🥶😴o🐶🥶\". Maybe \"solution\"? Let's check letters: s o l u t i o n. Wait, \"solution\" is 8 letters. Let's see: s o l u t i o n. So:\n\ns o l u t i o n → 🐮 o 🤓 😴 🥶 🐶 o 🥶. Let's match:\n\n🐮=s (so \"so\" starts)\no=🐨 (known)\nl=🤓\nu=😴\nt=🥶\ni=🐶\no=🐨 (again)\nn=🥶? No, because \"n\" would be the 8th letter. But \"solution\" is s o l u t i o n (8 letters). Let's see: positions 1: s (🐮), 2: o (🐨), 3: l (🤓), 4: u (😴), 5: t (🥶), 6: i (🐶), 7: o (🐨), 8: n (🥶). So the 8th emoji is 🥶, which would be n. So if \"solution\" is the word, then:\n\n🐮=s, 🤓=l, 😴=u, 🥶=t, 🐶=i, 🥶=n? But 🥶 can't be both t and n. So that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe \"doctoral\"? No, not sure.\n\nAnother angle: the 4th attempt's feedback for 🐨=o was correct, so \"o\" is in there. Let's look at \"l🐷c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶\" → \"l e c e 🤭🥶e🐶\". That's \"lece🤭🥶e🐶\". Let's count letters: 8 letters. Maybe \"leverage\"? Let's check: l e v e r a g e. So l e (🐷=e) v (🦆=v?) e r (🤖=r) a (🥶=a) g (🐱=g) e (🐷=e). Wait, \"leverage\" is l e v e r a g e (8 letters). Let's match:\n\nl (l)\ne (🐷=e)\nv (🦆=v)\ne (🐷=e)\nr (🤖=r)\na (🥶=a)\ng (🐱=g)\ne (🐷=e)\n\nSo the part \"l🐷c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶\" would be l e c e 🤭🥶e🐶. If \"leverage\", then c (third character) would be v, but the third emoji here is \"c\" (from the encoded sentence: \"l🐷c🐷...\"). Wait, the original encoded sentence has \"l🐷c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶\" — so \"l e c e 🤭🥶e🐶\". So \"lece...\" — maybe \"letter\"? Let's see: l e t t e r. But that's 6 letters. Hmm.\n\nAnother part: \"6🥶🤖\" — 6 is a number. If \"6\" is part of the word, maybe \"six\" but 6 is written as 6, so perhaps it's a code. Let's skip that for now.\n\nLooking at \"🦉🦆🐶l🧐🦆🐮🐷🤓🥶\" — substituting knowns: p 🦆 🐶 l 🧐 🦆 🐮 e 🤓 🥶. That's \"p 🦆 🐶 l 🧐 🦆 🐮 e 🤓 🥶\". Let's count letters: 10 letters. Maybe \"paragraph...\" but not sure. \"p\" is the first letter (🦉=p), so the word starts with p. Maybe \"paragraph\"? Let's check: p a r a g r a p h. No, length 9. \"Parameter\"? p a r a m e t e r. 9 letters. Hmm.\n\nThe 3rd attempt's feedback: 🦉=p (correct). So \"p\" is fixed.\n\nLet's check the 4th attempt's guess where 🐨=o was correct, so \"o\" is in. Let's look at \"🥳🐷\" which is \"🥳e\". If \"we\", then 🥳=w. Let's say 🥳=w. Then \"🥳e\" is \"we\".\n\nAnother part: \"🐮🐨🤓\" → \"🐮o🤓\". If \"con\", then 🐮=c, 🤓=n. But \"con\" is possible. Let's check if that makes sense.\n\nThe encoded sentence starts with \"🧐🤓 1265\". If \"🧐🤓\" is \"in\" (🧐=i, 🤓=n), then \"in 1265\". Maybe a date or code. Let's see.\n\nLet's try to make a guess. Let's list the known emojis:\n\n🐷=e (given)\n🐨=o (from attempt 4)\n🦉=p (from attempt 3)\n\nWe need to guess the others. Let's try to assign possible letters.\n\nLet's assume:\n\n- 🥳=w (so \"🥳e\" = \"we\")\n- 🐮=c (so \"🐮o🤓\" = \"co\" + 🤓. If \"con\", then 🤓=n)\n- 🤓=n (so \"co\" + \"n\" → \"con\")\n- Then \"🐮o🤓\" = \"con\" (c o n)\n- \"🧐🤓\" would be \"🧐n\". If \"in\", then 🧐=i. So \"in 1265\" → possible.\n- 🤭: Let's look at \"🤭🧐🐮o🤓\" → \"🤭 i c o n\". Maybe \"icon\" → \"icon\" is i c o n. So the word would be \"🤭icon\". Wait, the structure is \"🤭🧐🐮o🤓\" → \"🤭 i c o n\". If that's \"icon\", then the first emoji is 🤭, so \"icon\" would be \"i c o n\", but the structure here is 🤭 (first letter) + 🧐(i) + 🐮(c) + o (🐨) + 🤓(n). So that's \"🤭 i c o n\" → \"jicon\"? No. Alternatively, \"bicon\"? Maybe not. Alternatively, \"sicon\"? Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: \"🥶🤖🐷\" → \"🥶🤖e\". If \"the\", then 🥶=t, 🤖=h. So \"the\". Let's try that.\n\nSo:\n\n🥶=t, 🤖=h → \"the\"\n\nThen \"6🥶🤖\" → \"6th\" (6 t h → 6th). That makes sense! \"6th\" is a common abbreviation. So 6🥶🤖 = 6th. That fits. So:\n\n🥶=t (so \"6🥶🤖\" = 6th)\n🤖=h (so \"🤖\"=h)\n\nThat's a good lead. Let's check:\n\n6🥶🤖 → 6 t h → 6th. Perfect. So:\n\n🥶=t\n🤖=h\n\nNow, let's substitute these into the sentence:\n\nEncoded Sentence (updated):\n🧐🤓 1265, 🤭🧐🐮o🤓 we 🐮o🤓t😴ot🐶t, 6th e🦆🐶l ot 😴 l e🧐c e🤭t e🐶 🤭🐱🐮🐮o🤓e w t h e 😴🧐🐶🤭t e l e c t e w p🦆🐶l🧐🦆🐮e🤓t.\n\nLet's check the \"6🥶🤖\" part: 6 t h → 6th. That works.\n\nNext, \"🥶🤖🐷\" → t h e → the. That works. So \"🥶🤖🐷\" = the.\n\nNow, \"🐷🦆🐶l\" → e 🦆 🐶 l. If \"evil\", then 🦆=v, 🐶=i. Let's check: e v i l → evil. That's a word. So:\n\n🦆=v, 🐶=i → \"evil\" (e v i l)\n\nLet's check that. So \"🐷🦆🐶l\" = e v i l → evil. That's a good fit. So:\n\n🦆=v\n🐶=i\n\nNow, substituting:\n\nEncoded Sentence (updated):\n🧐🤓 1265, 🤭🧐🐮o🤓 we 🐮o🤓t😴ot i t, 6th evil ot 😴 l e🧐c e🤭t e i 🤭🐱🐮🐮o🤓e w the 😴🧐i🤭t e l e c t e w p v i l🧐v🐮e🤓t.\n\nLet's look at \"🐮o🤓t😴ot i t\" → \"🐮 o 🤓 t 😴 o t i t\". Let's count letters: 9 letters. Maybe \"doctorit\" but not. Alternatively, \"construction\"? No. Let's think of a possible word. Let's see, \"🐮o🤓\" is \"🐮 o 🤓\". If \"con\" (c o n), then \"con\" + \"t\" (🥶=t) + \"😴\" + \"o\" (🐨=o) + \"t\" (🥶=t) + \"i\" (🐶=i) + \"t\" (🥶=t). So \"con t 😴 o t i t\". Maybe \"contortion\" (c o n t o r t i o n). Let's check:\n\nc o n t o r t i o n → 10 letters. Let's see:\n\nc (🐮) o (🐨) n (🤓) t (🥶) o (🐨) r (😴) t (🥶) i (🐶) o (🐨) n (🤓). Oh! That's 10 letters. Let's check:\n\nThe part in the encoded sentence is \"🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶\" → \"🐮 o 🤓 t 😴 o i t\". Wait, original part: \"🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶\" → \"🐮 o 🤓 t 😴 o i t\". That's 8 emojis (8 letters). Let's count:\n\n1: 🐮 → c\n2: 🐨 → o\n3: 🤓 → n\n4: 🥶 → t\n5: 😴 → r\n6: 🐨 → o\n7: 🐶 → i\n8: 🥶 → t\n\nSo the word is \"con t r o i t\" → \"controit\"? Not a standard word, but maybe \"contorti\" (but that's 8 letters: c o n t r o i t). Alternatively, \"contort\" (7 letters: c o n t r o t). Let's see. \"contort\" is 7 letters: c o n t r o t. Then the 8th letter is i (🐶=i) → \"contorti\"? Not sure. Maybe \"contour\" (c o n t o u r). But 7 letters. Let's see:\n\nc o n t o u r → 7 letters. Then:\n\n🐮=c, 🐨=o, 🤓=n, 🥶=t, 😴=u, 🐨=o, 🐶=r? But no, 🐶 was set to i. So maybe \"contour\" is not.\n\nAlternatively, \"cotton\" (c o t t o n). No, that's 6 letters.\n\nLet's look at another part: \"l🐷c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶\" → \"l e c e 🤭 t e i\". That's \"lece🤭tei\". Let's count letters: 8. Maybe \"lecture\" (l e c t u r e). But 7 letters. Hmm. \"Lectures\" would be 8, but \"lectures\" is l e c t u r e s. Let's see:\n\nl e c t u r e s → 8 letters. Let's match:\n\nl (l)\ne (🐷=e)\nc (c)\nt (🥶=t)\nu (😴=u)\nr (🤖=h? No, 🤖=h). Wait, 🤖=h from earlier. So maybe not. Alternatively, \"letters\" (l e t t e r s). 7 letters. Let's see:\n\nl e t t e r s → 7 letters. The part here is \"l e c e 🤭 t e i\" → 8 letters, so not.\n\nLet's try to find 😴. Let's look at \"🐨😴\" → o 😴. If \"of\", then 😴=f. So \"of\". Let's check. \"🐨😴\" = o f → of. That's possible. So 😴=f.\n\nThen \"🐨😴\" → o f → of.\n\nLet's substitute 😴=f. Then:\n\nEncoded Sentence (updated with 😴=f):\n🧐🤓 1265, 🤭🧐🐮o🤓 we 🐮o🤓t f o t i t, 6th evil of l e🧐c e🤭t e i 🤭🐱🐮🐮o🤓e w the f🧐i🤭t e l e c t e w p v i l🧐v🐮e🤓t.\n\nLooking at \"🐨😴\" → o f → of. That's a good fit. Let's check \"evil of\" → \"evil of\" which could make sense in a sentence.\n\nNext, \"l🐷c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶\" → l e c e 🤭 t e i → \"lece🤭tei\". Let's think of \"lectern\" (l e c t e r n) but 7 letters. Alternatively, \"lecture\" (l e c t u r e) 7 letters. Hmm.\n\nAnother part: \"🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓🐷🥳\" → 🤭 🐱 🐮 🐮 o 🤓 e w. Let's count letters: 8. Maybe \"swimming\" but no. Let's see if \"something\" (s o m e t h i n g) but not. Alternatively, \"shopping\" (s h o p p i n g). No. Maybe \"bouncing\" (b o u n c i n g). Not sure.\n\nLet's look at \"🧐🤓\" → two letters. Let's say \"it\". So 🧐=i, 🤓=t. Then \"it 1265\" → possible. Let's check if that works with other parts.\n\nIf 🧐=i, 🤓=t:\n\nThen \"🧐🤓\" → i t → it.\n\n\"🤭🧐🐮o🤓\" → 🤭 i 🐮 o t. Let's say \"digit\" → d i g i t. But \"🤭 i 🐮 o t\" → \"🤭i🐮ot\". Maybe \"digit\" would be d i g i t, but the structure is 5 letters: 🤭 (d) + i (🧐) + 🐮 (g) + o (🐨) + t (🤓). So \"d i g i t\" → digit. That's a 5-letter word. So:\n\n🤭=d\n🐮=g\n\nLet's check that. So:\n\n🤭=d\n🐮=g\n\nThen \"🤭🧐🐮o🤓\" → d i g o t → \"digot\"? Not a word. Oh, maybe \"digit\" is d i g i t. But in the structure, it's 🤭 (d) + 🧐 (i) + 🐮 (g) + 🐨 (o) + 🤓 (t) → d i g o t. That's \"digot\", which isn't a word. Maybe \"dogit\"? No.\n\nAlternatively, \"🤭🧐🐮o🤓\" could be \"comit\" (c o m i t), but that's 5 letters. If 🤭=c, 🧐=o, 🐮=m, but we have 🐨=o already. No, 🐨=o.\n\nAnother approach: Let's check the 4th attempt's feedback. In attempt 4, they guessed 🐨=o (correct), and the feedback was True. So that's fixed. Also, 🦉=p (from attempt 3) is correct. 🐷=e is correct.\n\nLet's list all emojis and possible letters:\n\nEmojis: 🧐, 🤓, 🤭, 🐮, 🐨(o), 🥳, 🐷(e), 🥶, 😴, 🐶, 🦆, 🤖, 🐱, 🦉(p)\n\nKnown: 🐨=o, 🐷=e, 🦉=p.\n\nWe need to guess the rest. Let's try to find possible letters based on the sentence structure.\n\nThe encoded sentence starts with two emojis: 🧐🤓. Let's assume it's a common two-letter word like \"it\", \"is\", \"on\", \"at\", \"to\", \"so\", \"he\", \"we\", \"by\", \"my\", \"up\", \"in\", \"an\", \"or\", \"of\", \"if\", \"as\", \"id\", \"am\", \"be\", \"ha\", etc.\n\nThe next part after the comma is \"🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓 🥳🐷\" → \"🤭🧐🐮o🤓 🥳e\". Let's say \"🥳e\" is \"we\" (🥳=w), \"me\" (🥳=m), \"be\" (🥳=b), \"he\" (🥳=h), \"she\" (🥳=s), \"they\" (no, two letters). Let's say \"we\" (🥳=w).\n\nSo \"🤭🧐🐮o🤓 we\". Let's assume that's a clause like \"In the we...\" No. Maybe \"Digit we...\" No. Let's think of \"Project we...\" No.\n\nAnother part: \"6🥶🤖\" → 6th (as before, if 🥶=t, 🤖=h). That makes sense, so let's stick with 🥶=t, 🤖=h.\n\nThen \"6🥶🤖\" → 6th.\n\n\"🐷🦆🐶l\" → e 🦆 🐶 l. Let's say \"evil\" (e v i l). So 🦆=v, 🐶=i. That's a good fit.\n\nSo:\n\n🦆=v\n🐶=i\n\nThen \"🐷🦆🐶l\" = e v i l → evil.\n\nNext, \"🐨😴\" → o 😴. Let's say \"of\" (o f), so 😴=f.\n\nSo 😴=f. Then \"🐨😴\" = o f → of.\n\nNow, \"l🐷c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶\" → l e c e 🤭 t e i → \"lece🤭tei\". Let's think of \"lectern\" (l e c t e r n), but that's 7 letters. Or \"lecture\" (l e c t u r e) 7 letters. Not matching. Maybe \"letters\" (l e t t e r s) 7 letters. No. Let's see: \"lece🤭tei\" → 8 letters. Maybe \"lectures\" (l e c t u r e s) 8 letters. Let's check:\n\nl e c t u r e s → 8 letters. Let's match:\n\nl (l)\ne (🐷=e)\nc (c)\nt (🥶=t)\nu (😴=u? No, 😴=f)\nr (r)\ne (🐷=e)\ns (s)\n\nBut 😴=f, so that's not. Alternatively, \"lecterns\" (l e c t e r n s) 8 letters. Still not matching.\n\nLet's look at \"🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓🐷🥳\" → 🤭 🐱 🐮 🐮 o 🤓 e w. Let's count letters: 8. Maybe \"swimming\" (s w i m m i n g) 8 letters. Let's check:\n\ns w i m m i n g → 8 letters.\n\nIf:\n\n🤭=s\n🐱=w\n🐮=m\n🤓=n\nThen:\n\ns w m m o n e w → \"swmmonew\"? No. Doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, \"shopping\" (s h o p p i n g) 8 letters.\n\ns h o p p i n g → 8 letters.\n\nIf:\n\n🤭=s\n🐱=h\n🐮=p\n🤓=n\nThen:\n\ns h p p o n e w → \"shpponew\"? No.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the word \"the\" which is \"🥶🤖🐷\" → t h e (since 🥶=t, 🤖=h, 🐷=e). That works. So \"the\" is correct.\n\nThe part \"🥶🤖🐷\" = the.\n\nNow, \"😴🧐🐶🤭🥶\" → f 🧐 i 🤭 t. Let's say \"fight\" (f i g h t). Let's check:\n\nf i g h t → 5 letters. So:\n\n😴=f\n🧐=i\n🐶=g? No, 🐶=i (from earlier \"evil\" assumption). Oh, no, earlier we thought 🐶=i for \"evil\" (e v i l). So 🐶=i. So \"😴🧐🐶🤭🥶\" → f 🧐 i 🤭 t. Let's say \"faint\" (f a i n t). Then:\n\n🧐=a\n🤭=n\nSo \"f a i n t\" → faint. That's a good fit. Let's try that.\n\nSo:\n\n🧐=a\n🤭=n\n\nThen \"😴🧐🐶🤭🥶\" = f a i n t → faint.\n\nLet's check if that works with other parts.\n\nNow, \"🧐🤓\" → a 🤓. If \"at\", then 🤓=t. So \"at 1265\" → possible. Let's try 🤓=t.\n\nSo 🤓=t.\n\nThen \"🧐🤓\" = a t → at.\n\nNow, \"🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓\" → n a 🐮 o t. Let's say \"n a t o t\" → not a word. Maybe \"n a g o t\" (if 🐮=g). \"n a g o t\" → \"nagot\" (not a word, but maybe \"nag\" + \"ot\"). Alternatively, \"n a m o t\" (if 🐮=m). \"namot\" not a word.\n\nAlternatively, \"n a c o t\" (if 🐮=c). \"nacot\" not a word.\n\nLet's look at \"🐮🐨🤓\" → 🐮 o t. Let's say \"got\" (g o t). So 🐮=g. Then \"🐮 o t\" → g o t → got. That's a word.\n\nSo 🐮=g.\n\nThen \"🐮🐨🤓\" = g o t → got.\n\nNow, \"🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓\" → n a g o t → \"nagot\". Not a standard word, but maybe a name or part of a sentence. Let's proceed.\n\nNow, \"🥳🐷\" → 🥳 e. Let's say \"we\" (🥳=w). So \"we\".\n\nSo 🥳=w.\n\nThen \"🥳🐷\" = w e → we.\n\nPutting it all together so far:\n\nKnown:\n🐨=o\n🐷=e\n🦉=p\n🥶=t\n🤖=h\n🦆=v\n🐶=i\n😴=f\n🧐=a\n🤓=t\n🤭=n\n🐮=g\n🥳=w\n🐱=?\n\nLet's substitute all into the encoded sentence:\n\nEncoded Sentence:\na t 1265, n a g o t w e g o t f o t i t, 6 t h e v i l o f f l e a c e n t e i n [unknown] g g o t e w t h e f a i n t e l e c t e w p v i l a v g e t.\n\nWait, let's do it step by step:\n\nOriginal encoded sentence:\n🧐🤓 1265, 🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓 🥳🐷 🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶, 6🥶🤖 🐷🦆🐶l 🐨😴 l🐷🧐c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶 🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓🐷🥳 🥶🤖🐷 😴🧐🐶🤭🥶 🐷l🐷c🥶🐷🥳 🦉🦆🐶l🧐🦆🐮🐷🤓🥶.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n🧐=a, 🤓=t → a t\n🤭=n, 🧐=a, 🐮=g, 🐨=o, 🤓=t → n a g o t\n🥳=w, 🐷=e → w e\n🐮=g, 🐨=o, 🤓=t, 🥶=t, 😴=f, 🐨=o, 🐶=i, 🥶=t → g o t f o i t (Wait, the original part is \"🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶\" → g o t t f o i t?

The key points are:\n\n- 6th (6 t h) → correct.\n- evil (e v i l) → correct.\n- of (o f) → correct.\n- the (t h e) → correct.\n- faint (f a i n t) → correct.\n- at (a t) → possible start.\n\nNow, the remaining emoji is 🐱. Let's see where it appears: \"🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓🐷🥳\" → n 🐱 g g o t e w. Let's say \"n\" + 🐱 + \"ggotew\". Maybe \"n\" + \"u\" + \"ggotew\" → \"nuggote w\"? No. Maybe \"n\" + \"b\" + \"ggotew\" → \"nbggotew\". Alternatively, \"n\" + \"s\" + \"ggotew\" → \"nsggotew\". Alternatively, \"n\" + \"m\" + \"ggotew\" → \"nmggotew\". Not helpful. Maybe \"n\" + \"h\" + \"ggotew\" → \"nhggotew\". Alternatively, \"n\" + \"d\" → \"ndggotew\". Not helpful. Maybe \"n\" + \"c\" → \"ncggotew\". Alternatively, \"n\" + \"k\" → \"nkggotew\". Let's pick a common letter, like \"s\". So 🐱=s. Then \"n s g g o t e w\" → \"nsggotew\". Not a word, but maybe it's part of a longer term.\n\nPutting all together, the guess would be:\n\n🧐=a, 🤓=t, 🤭=n, 🐮=g, 🐨=o, 🥳=w, 🐷=e, 🥶=t, 😴=f, 🐶=i, 🦆=v, 🤖=h, 🐱=s, 🦉=p\n\nLet's check if any of these conflict with previous feedback. For example, in attempt 1, 🧐 was guessed as t (False), which is okay because we're guessing a now. Attempt 2 guessed 🧐=h (False), okay. Attempt 3 guessed 🧐=n (False), okay. Attempt 4 guessed 🧐=t (False), okay. So a is new. Similarly, other guesses:\n\n🤓 was guessed as o, e, d, o (all False). Now we're guessing t. That's new.\n\n🤭 was guessed as a, t, i, h (all False). Now n is new.\n\n🐮 was guessed as d, o, t, d (all False). Now g is new.\n\n🥳 was guessed as s, w, b, s (all False). Now w is from attempt 2 (they guessed 🥳=w, feedback was False. Oh! Attempt 2's guess was 🥳=w, and feedback was False. So we can't use 🥳=w. Oh, right! The feedback for attempt 2 says 🥳: False. So 🥳=w is incorrect. Oops, that's a mistake.\n\nSo 🥳=w is invalid. Let's adjust. Let's pick another letter for 🥳. Let's say 🥳=b. Attempt 3 guessed 🥳=b, feedback was False. So no. Attempt 1: 🥳=s (False). Attempt 4: 🥳=s (False). So 🥳 can't be s. Maybe 🥳=m. Let's try 🥳=m. Then \"🥳e\" = m e → me. That's possible.\n\nSo 🥳=m. Then \"🥳e\" = m e → me.\n\nLet's adjust the guess. So:\n\n🥳=m.\n\nThen \"🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓🐷🥳\" → n 🐱 g g o t e m → \"n[?]ggotem\". Maybe \"n\" + \"a\" + \"ggotem\" → \"naggotem\" (nag got em?). That's possible. So 🐱=a. Then \"n a g g o t e m\" → \"naggotem\". Maybe \"nag got em\".\n\nBut let's check the feedback for previous attempts. For example, in attempt 4, 🐱 was guessed as n (feedback False). So 🐱=a is okay.\n\nLet's rework the guess with 🥳=m (since 🥳=w was invalid due to attempt 2's feedback).\n\nAnother possible 🥳=b (attempt 3 guessed 🥳=b, feedback False), so no. 🥳=k? Let's say 🥳=k. \"ke\" → not common. 🥳=d? \"de\" → \"de\". Maybe.\n\nAlternatively, 🥳=h. \"he\" → \"he\". Attempt 2 guessed 🥳=w (False), attempt 1: s (False), 3: b (False), 4: s (False). So 🥳=h is possible. Let's try 🥳=h. Then \"🥳e\" = h e → he.\n\nSo \"🤭🧐🐮o🤓 he\". Let's say \"n a g o t he\" → \"nagot he\". Possible.\n\nThis is getting quite involved, but given the time, I'll proceed to make a guess based on the patterns we've considered, ensuring that known correct emojis are included.\n\nTo solve this Crypto Word Game, we analyze the encoded sentence, hints, and feedback from previous attempts. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Known Correct Emojis:\n- **🐷=e** (given hint)\n- **🐨=o** (feedback from Attempt 4: `🐨`: True)\n- **🦉=p** (feedback from Attempt 3: `🦉`: True)\n\n### Deductions from Feedback and Patterns:\n1. **6🥶🤖**: Likely \"6th\" (common abbreviation), so `🥶=t` and `🤖=h`.\n2. **🐷🦆🐶l**: Likely \"evil\" (common word), so `🦆=v` and `🐶=i`.\n3. **🐨😴**: Likely \"of\" (common preposition), so `😴=f`.\n4. **🥶🤖🐷**: Likely \"the\" (most common word), confirming `🥶=t`, `🤖=h`, and `🐷=e`.\n5. **😴🧐🐶🤭🥶**: Likely \"faint\" (5-letter word), so `😴=f`, `🧐=a`, `🐶=i`, `🤭=n`, and `🥶=t`.\n6. **🧐🤓**: Likely \"at\" (common two-letter word), so `🧐=a` and `🤓=t`.\n7. **🐮🐨🤓**: Likely \"got\" (common word), so `🐮=g`.\n8. **🥳🐷**: Likely \"me\" (common pronoun), so `🥳=m` (since previous guesses for `🥳` like `s`, `w`, `b` were incorrect).\n9. **🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓🐷🥳**: Filling in knowns, this becomes `n 🐱 g g o t e m`. A plausible fit is `naggotem` (informal for \"nag got 'em\"), so `🐱=a`.\n\n### Final Guess:\nBased on the above deductions, the guessed mappings are:\n\n🧐=a, 🤓=t, 🤭=n, 🐮=g, 🐨=o, 🥳=m, 🐷=e, 🥶=t, 😴=f, 🐶=i, 🦆=v, 🤖=h, 🐱=a, 🦉=p\n\nAnswer: 🧐=a,🤓=t,🤭=n,🐮=g,🐨=o,🥳=m,🐷=e,🥶=t,😴=f,🐶=i,🦆=v,🤖=h,🐱=a,🦉=p","Okay, let's try to figure out the current state. The encoded sentence has a bunch of emojis, and we know that 🐷=e from the hint, and the history gives us feedback on previous guesses. Let's list out what's confirmed first.\n\nLooking at the History:\n\nAttempt 1: 🐷=e was correct (Feedback: 🐷=True). All others were wrong.\nAttempt 2: Again, 🐷=e is correct, others wrong.\nAttempt 3: 🦉=p was correct (Feedback: 🦉=True). So 🦉=p.\nAttempt 4: 🐨=o was correct (Feedback: 🐨=True). So 🐨=o.\nAttempt 5: 🐨=o (still correct), 🐷=e (correct), 🥶=t (Feedback: 🥶=True), 😴=f (Feedback: 😴=True), 🤖=h (Feedback: 🤖=True), 🦉=p (correct). So from attempt 5, we have:\n- 🐨=o\n- 🐷=e\n- 🥶=t\n- 😴=f\n- 🤖=h\n- 🦉=p\n\nSo let's note these confirmed ones:\n🐷=e, 🐨=o, 🥶=t, 😴=f, 🤖=h, 🦉=p.\n\nNow, the encoded sentence is:\n\n🧐🤓 1265, 🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓 🥳🐷 🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶, 6🥶🤖 🐷🦆🐶l 🐨😴 l🐷🧐c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶 🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓🐷🥳 🥶🤖🐷 😴🧐🐶🤭🥶 🐷l🐷c🥶🐷🥳 🦉🦆🐶l🧐🦆🐮🐷🤓🥶.\n\nLet's substitute the known emojis:\n\n🧐🤓 1265, 🤭🧐🐮o🤓 🥳e 🐮o🤓t f o🐶t, 6t h e🦆🐶l o f l e🧐c e🤭t e🐶 🤭🐱🐮🐮o🤓e🥳 t h e f🧐🐶🤭t e l e c t e🥳 p 🦆🐶l🧐🦆🐮e🤓t.\n\nHmm, let's parse parts of this. Let's look at the first part: 🧐🤓 1265. Maybe a number or a word. Let's see other parts.\n\nNext: 🤭🧐🐮o🤓 🥳e. So [🤭][🧐][🐮]o[🤓] [🥳]e. Maybe a phrase. Let's look at the part after that: 🐮o🤓t f o🐶t. So [🐮]o[🤓]t f o[🐶]t. \"f o\" is \"fo\", maybe \"foot\"? If \"o[🐶]t\" is \"o?t\", like \"ost\" (if 🐶=s) but let's check.\n\nThen, \"6t h e\" from \"6🥶🤖 🐷\" (6🥶🤖 is 6t h, and 🐷=e). So \"6th e\" maybe \"6th the\"? Maybe 6th is part of a date, like 1265 is a year? The first part is \"🧐🤓 1265\", perhaps \"In 1265\"? If 🧐🤓 is \"In\", then 🧐=i, 🤓=n. Let's check if that's possible. Let's tentatively think 🧐=i, 🤓=n. Let's test.\n\nIf 🧐=i, 🤓=n:\n\nFirst part: i n 1265, so \"In 1265,\". That makes sense. Let's proceed.\n\nThen, \"🤭i🐮o n 🥳e\". So [🤭]i[🐮]on [🥳]e. Maybe \"During the\" if [🥳]e is \"the\", so 🥳=t? But wait, \"the\" would be t-h-e, but we already have 🥶=t. Oh, no, 🥶=t. So [🥳]e would be \"?e\". Maybe \"came\" (🥳=c, \"came\")? Let's see.\n\nNext part: \"🐮o n t f o🐶t\". So [🐮]ont f o[🐶]t. \"f o\" is \"fo\", so \"foot\" if 🐶=o, but 🐨=o already. So maybe \"f o[🐶]t\" is \"fost\"? Or \"foot\" if 🐶=s (so \"fo s t\"? No). Let's look at another part: \"6t h e\" (6🥶🤖 🐷) is \"6th e\" (6 t h e). Maybe \"6th the\" → \"6th the...\" Maybe \"6th the king\" or something.\n\nNext: \"🐷🦆🐶l\" is e[🦆][🐶]l. So e?l. Maybe \"evil\" (if 🦆=v, 🐶=i: e v i l → evil). Let's check if that's possible. If 🐶=i, then \"o[🐶]t\" (from earlier) would be \"oit\", but maybe \"oint\" (if [🐮]o[🤓]t is \"point\"). Let's check: [🐮]o[🤓]t → [🐮]o n t → \"point\" (if 🐮=p). So if 🐮=p, then \"point\". So 🐮=p? Let's see. Then \"🐮o n t\" would be \"point\". That works. So 🐮=p.\n\nSo 🐮=p. Then, \"🐮o n t\" → \"point\". Then \"f o[🐶]t\" → \"fo[🐶]t\". If \"point f o[🐶]t\" → \"point foot\" (if 🐶=o, but 🐨=o already. Can't be. So \"point foot\" would need 🐶=o, which is taken. So maybe \"point fost\"? Not sure. Let's check other parts.\n\nNext: \"🐨😴\" → o f → \"of\". That's good. So \"o f\" is \"of\". Then \"l🐷🧐c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶\" → l e i c e [🤭] t e [🐶]. So \"leice[🤭]te[🐶]\". Let's see. Maybe \"legic...\". Hmm.\n\nAnother part: \"🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓🐷🥳\" → [🤭][🐱]pp o n e [🥳]. So [🤭][🐱]ppone[🥳]. Maybe \"supporter\" (if [🤭]=s, [🐱]=u, [🥳]=r). \"supporter\" → s u p p o n e r. That could fit. So \"supporter\". Let's check: [🤭]=s, [🐱]=u, [🥳]=r.\n\nThen \"🥶🤖🐷\" → t h e → \"the\". That's perfect. \"t h e\" → \"the\". So \"the\".\n\nNext: \"😴🧐🐶🤭🥶\" → f i [🐶][🤭]t. If [🤭]=s, then \"f i [🐶] s t\". Maybe \"first\" (if 🐶=r). \"f i r s t\" → first. That works. So 🐶=r, [🤭]=s. Let's check: \"f i r s t\" → first.\n\nSo \"😴🧐🐶🤭🥶\" → f i r s t → \"first\". That's good.\n\nThen \"🐷l🐷c🥶🐷🥳\" → e l e c t e [🥳]. \"electe[🥳]\". If [🥳]=d, then \"elected\". \"electe d\" → elected. That works. So [🥳]=d.\n\nThen \"🦉🦆🐶l🧐🦆🐮🐷🤓🥶\" → p [🦆] r l i [🦆] p e n t. Let's parse that: p [🦆] r l i [🦆] p e n t. Maybe \"parliament\" (p a r l i a m e n t). Let's check. \"parliament\" is p a r l i a m e n t. So [🦆]=a, [🥳]=m? Wait, earlier we thought [🥳]=d, but maybe that's wrong. Let's recheck.\n\nIf \"p [🦆] r l i [🦆] p e n t\" → parliament (p a r l i a m e n t). So [🦆]=a, and then the missing part would be \"m\". Let's see where \"m\" could be. Let's check \"🐷l🐷c🥶🐷🥳\" → e l e c t e [🥳]. \"electe[🥳]\" → \"elected\" (if [🥳]=d) or \"elect m\" (if [🥳]=m). \"parliament\" would need [🦆]=a, so let's try [🦆]=a.\n\nThen \"p a r l i a m e n t\" → parliament. So [🥳]=m. Let's check \"🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓🐷🥳\" → [🤭][🐱]pp o n e m. If that's \"supponem\" → no. Maybe \"supporter\" was wrong. Let's think again.\n\nAnother angle: \"🥶🤖🐷\" → t h e → \"the\". That's correct. So \"the\".\n\n\"😴🧐🐶🤭🥶\" → f i [🐶][🤭]t. If \"first\" (f i r s t), then [🐶]=r, [🤭]=s. Let's confirm: \"f i r s t\" → first. So that works. So [🐶]=r, [🤭]=s.\n\nThen \"🤭=s\". Let's check \"🤭🧐🐮o🤓 🥳e\" → s i [🐮]o n [🥳]e. If \"s i [🐮]on [🥳]e\" → \"sition?e\". Maybe \"position e\"? No. Maybe \"situation e\" → \"situation the\"? If [🥳]=t, but 🥶=t. So [🥳] can't be t. Let's check \"6t h e\" → \"6th the\" → \"6th the...\". Maybe \"6th the king\" → \"6th the king\".\n\nLooking at \"🐷🦆🐶l\" → e [🦆] r l. \"evil\" (e v i l) would need [🦆]=v, [🐶]=i. But earlier thought of [🐶]=r. Let's check which is possible. Let's go back to the part \"🐮o🤓t f o🐶t\". If [🐮]o[🤓]t is \"port\" (if [🐮]=p, [🤓]=r). Wait, [🤓] was guessed as 'o' in attempt 1 (wrong), 'e' in attempt 2 (wrong), 'd' in attempt 3 (wrong), 'o' in attempt 4 (wrong), 't' in attempt 5 (wrong). So possible [🤓] could be 'r'? Let's try. If [🤓]=r, then \"port\".\n\nSo \"🐮o🤓t\" → [🐮]o r t. \"port\" if [🐮]=p. So [🐮]=p. Then \"port\". Then \"f o🐶t\" → f o [🐶] t. \"foot\" if [🐶]=o, but 🐨=o. So [🐶]=o is invalid. \"fost\" (if [🐶]=s). \"port fost\" → port fost? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, \"🐮o🤓t\" → \"went\" (if [🐮]=w, [🤓]=e). But [🤓] was guessed as 'e' in attempt 2 (wrong), so [🤓]≠e.\n\nLet's look at \"l🐷🧐c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶\" → l e [🧐] c e s t e [🐶]. So \"le[🧐]cest e[🐶]\". Maybe \"legislature\" (l e g i s l a t u r e). But let's see: \"le[🧐]cest e[🐶]\". If [🧐]=g, then \"legcest e[🐶]\". Not helpful.\n\nAnother part: \"🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓🐷🥳\" → [🤭][🐱][🐮][🐮]o[🤓]e[🥳]. If [🤭]=b, [🐱]=r, [🐮]=o, then \"brooo...\". No.\n\nLet's recap confirmed emojis:\n\n- 🐷=e (given)\n- 🐨=o (attempt 4 correct)\n- 🥶=t (attempt 5 correct)\n- 😴=f (attempt 5 correct)\n- 🤖=h (attempt 5 correct)\n- 🦉=p (attempt 3 and 5 correct)\n\nNeed to guess the remaining emojis: 🧐, 🤓, 🤭, 🐮, 🥳, 🐶, 🦆, 🐱.\n\nLet's look at the structure again. Let's substitute the knowns into the entire sentence:\n\nEncoded Sentence (with knowns):\n\n🧐🤓 1265, 🤭🧐🐮o🤓 🥳e 🐮o🤓t f o🐶t, 6t h e🦆🐶l o f l e🧐c e🤭t e🐶 🤭🐱🐮🐮o🤓e🥳 t h e f🧐🐶🤭t e l e c t e🥳 p 🦆🐶l🧐🦆🐮e🤓t.\n\nBreaking into parts:\n\n1. \"🧐🤓 1265,\" → Maybe a year, so \"In 1265,\" (🧐=i, 🤓=n). Let's test this. If 🧐=i, 🤓=n.\n\n2. \"🤭i🐮o n 🥳e\" → [🤭]i[🐮]on [🥳]e. Maybe \"During the\" → \"During the\" (if [🤭]=d, [🐮]=u, [🥳]=t). But [🥶]=t, so [🥳] can't be t. Alternatively, \"Mission the\" (if [🤭]=m, [🐮]=s, [🥳]=t). No.\n\n3. \"🐮o n t f o🐶t\" → [🐮]ont f o[🐶]t. \"point foot\" (if [🐮]=p, [🐶]=o). But 🐨=o, so [🐶]≠o. \"punt foot\" (if [🐮]=u). Not helpful.\n\n4. \"6t h e\" → \"6th e\" → \"6th the\" (if 6=6, t=th, h=he → 6th the).\n\n5. \"e🦆🐶l\" → e[🦆][🐶]l. \"evil\" (e v i l) → [🦆]=v, [🐶]=i. Let's check this possibility. If [🦆]=v, [🐶]=i.\n\nThen \"o f\" → of (correct).\n\n6. \"l e🧐c e🤭t e i\" → l e[🧐]c e[🤭]t e i. Maybe \"legislate i\" → \"legislate i\". If [🧐]=g, [🤭]=s. \"legislate i\" → \"legislate i\".\n\n7. \"🤭🐱🐮🐮o n e🥳\" → [🤭][🐱][🐮][🐮]one[🥳]. If [🤭]=s, [🐱]=u, [🐮]=p, [🥳]=r → \"supponer\" (supporter). \"supporter\".\n\n8. \"t h e\" → the (correct).\n\n9. \"f🧐i🤭t\" → f[🧐]i[🤭]t. \"first\" (f i r s t) → [🧐]=i, [🤭]=s. If [🧐]=i, then \"f i i s t\" → no. If [🧐]=r, [🤭]=s → \"f r i s t\" → no. If [🧐]=r, [🐶]=i, [🤭]=s → \"f r i s t\" → \"frist\" (typo for first). Possible.\n\n10. \"e l e c t e🥳\" → electe[🥳]. \"elected\" (if [🥳]=d).\n\n11. \"p v i l i v [🐮]e n t\" → p v i l i v [🐮]e n t. Maybe \"parliament\" (p a r l i a m e n t). If [🦆]=a, [🐮]=m, then \"p a r l i a m e n t\" → parliament.\n\nLet's try putting all these together with possible guesses:\n\nAssume:\n\n- 🧐=i (from \"In 1265\")\n- 🤓=n (from \"In 1265\")\n- 🤭=d (from \"During...\")\n- 🐮=g (random guess)\n- 🥳=s (from \"the s...\")\n- 🐶=i (from \"evil\" e v i l)\n- 🦆=v (from \"evil\")\n- 🐱=u (from \"supporter\")\n\nBut need to check the feedback from previous attempts. Let's check the history:\n\nAttempt 1: 🧐=t (wrong), 🤓=o (wrong), 🤭=a (wrong), 🐮=d (wrong), 🐨=g (wrong, but now we know 🐨=o), 🥳=s (feedback: False, so 🥳≠s), 🐷=e (correct), 🥶=h (wrong), 😴=u (wrong), 🐶=i (feedback: False, so 🐶≠i), 🦆=v (feedback: False, so 🦆≠v), 🤖=r (wrong), 🐱=n (wrong), 🦉=k (wrong). So 🐶=i was guessed in attempt 1, feedback: False. So 🐶≠i.\n\nAttempt 2: 🐶=b (feedback: False), 🦆=c (False), etc.\n\nAttempt 3: 🐶=s (feedback: False), 🦆=x (False), etc.\n\nAttempt 4: 🐶=i (feedback: False), 🦆=v (False), etc.\n\nAttempt 5: 🐶=i (feedback: False), 🦆=v (False), etc. So 🐶 can't be i, and 🦆 can't be v.\n\nAttempt 5: 🥶=t (correct), 😴=f (correct), 🤖=h (correct), 🦉=p (correct).\n\nSo, in attempt 5, 🐶=i (False), so 🐶≠i. 🦆=v (False), so 🦆≠v.\n\nLet's think of \"f o🐶t\" again. If 😴=f (correct), then \"f o🐶t\" → \"fo? t\". Maybe \"foot\" (o o t) but no. \"font\" (f o n t) if 🐶=n. So \"font\". If [🐶]=n, then \"fo n t\" → font. That works. So [🐶]=n.\n\nThen \"🐮o🤓t\" → [🐮]o[🤓]t. If [🐮]o[🤓]t is \"want\" (w a n t), then [🐮]=w, [🤓]=a. Let's check. \"want\".\n\nThen \"🤭🧐🐮o🤓 🥳e\" → [🤭][🧐]w o a [🥳]e. Maybe \"In 1265, [🤭][🧐]woa [🥳]e...\". Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, \"🐮o🤓t\" → \"went\" (w e n t). [🐮]=w, [🤓]=e. But [🤓] was guessed as e in attempt 2 (feedback: False), so [🤓]≠e.\n\nAnother angle: \"6t h e\" → \"6th e\" → \"6th the\". So \"6th the...\" Maybe \"6th the king\".\n\nLooking at \"🐷l🐷c🥶🐷🥳\" → e l e c t e [🥳]. \"elected\" (e l e c t e d). So [🥳]=d.\n\nIf [🥳]=d, then \"🥳e\" → \"de\". Maybe \"de\" as part of a word.\n\n\"🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓🐷🥳\" → [🤭][🐱][🐮][🐮]o[🤓]e d. Maybe \"government\" (g o v e r n m e n t). No. \"supporter\" (s u p p o r t e r) → s u p p o r t e r. If [🤓]=r, then \"supporter\" → [🤭]=s, [🐱]=u, [🐮]=p, [🤓]=r, [🥳]=r. But [🥳]=d earlier.\n\nAlternatively, \"minister\" (m i n i s t e r). Let's see: [🤭]=m, [🐱]=i, [🐮]=n, [🐮]=n, [🐨]=o (so \"nno...\"), no.\n\nLet's try to find the word \"parliament\" in the last part: \"p 🦆🐶l🧐🦆🐮e🤓t\" → p [🦆][🐶]l[🧐][🦆][🐮]e[🤓]t. If it's \"parliament\" (p a r l i a m e n t), then:\n\np a r l i a m e n t. So:\n\n[🦆]=a, [🐶]=r, [🧐]=i, [🐮]=m, [🤓]=n, [🥶]=t (which is correct). Let's check:\n\np a r l i a m e n t → p 🦆=a, 🐶=r, 🧐=i, 🦆=a, 🐮=m, e, 🤓=n, t=🥶=t. That fits! So:\n\n[🦆]=a, [🐶]=r, [🧐]=i, [🐮]=m, [🤓]=n, [🥶]=t (correct).\n\nLet's verify:\n\n\"p 🦆=a, 🐶=r, l, 🧐=i, 🦆=a, 🐮=m, e, 🤓=n, t=🥶=t\" → p a r l i a m e n t → parliament. Perfect!\n\nSo let's note these:\n\n🦆=a, 🐶=r, 🧐=i, 🐮=m, 🤓=n.\n\nNow check the feedback from previous attempts to ensure these are not already guessed and wrong.\n\nAttempt 1: 🧐=t (wrong), so 🧐=i is new. 🤓=o (wrong), so 🤓=n is new. 🐮=d (wrong), so 🐮=m is new. 🐶=i (wrong), so 🐶=r is new. 🦆=v (wrong), so 🦆=a is new. All these are new, so possible.\n\nNow, let's check other parts with these guesses.\n\nFirst part: 🧐=i, 🤓=n → \"i n 1265,\" → \"In 1265,\". Correct.\n\n\"🤭🧐🐮o🤓 🥳e\" → [🤭] i m o n [🥳]e. \"In 1265, [🤭]imon [🥳]e...\". Maybe \"Simon\" if [🤭]=S (capital, but probably lowercase). \"simon de...\" → \"Simon de...\".\n\n\"🐮o🤓t f o🐶t\" → m o n t f o r t. \"Montfort\". That's a name! Simon de Montfort. Oh, that makes sense. Simon de Montfort was a historical figure. So \"Simon de Montfort\".\n\nSo \"🤭🧐🐮o🤓 🥳e\" → [🤭]i m o n [🥳]e → \"Simon de\". So [🤭]=s (lowercase s), [🥳]=d. \"Simon de\".\n\nYes! So [🤭]=s, [🥳]=d.\n\nThen \"🐮o🤓t f o🐶t\" → m o n t f o r t → \"Montfort\". Perfect!\n\nSo:\n\n[🤭]=s, [🥳]=d.\n\nNow, let's check \"6t h e\" → 6 t h e → \"6th the\". \"6th the\" could be \"6th the...\".\n\n\"e🦆🐶l\" → e a r l → \"earl\". Simon de Montfort was an Earl. So \"earl\". That works. So \"e a r l\" → earl.\n\n\"o f\" → of (correct, since 😴=f, 🐨=o → o f → of).\n\n\"l e🧐c e🤭t e🐶\" → l e i c e s t e r → \"Leicester\". Leicester is a city. So \"Leicester\". That's correct! \"l e i c e s t e r\" → Leicester. So:\n\n[🧐]=i (already), [🤭]=s (already), [🐶]=r (already). So \"Leicester\".\n\n\"🤭🐱🐮🐮o🤓e🥳\" → s [🐱] m m o n e d. \"summoned\" (s u m m o n e d). So [🐱]=u. \"summoned\". That works! \"s u m m o n e d\" → summoned.\n\n\"t h e\" → the (correct, since 🥶=t, 🤖=h, 🐷=e → t h e → the).\n\n\"f🧐🐶🤭t\" → f i r s t → \"first\". Correct, since 😴=f, 🧐=i, 🐶=r, 🤭=s, 🥶=t → f i r s t → first.\n\n\"e l e c t e🥳\" → e l e c t e d → \"elected\". Correct, since 🐷=e, l, c, 🥶=t, 🥳=d → elected.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence would be:\n\n\"In 1265, Simon de Montfort, the earl of Leicester, summoned the first elected parliament.\"\n\nLet's verify each part:\n\nEncoded Sentence with substitutions:\n\n🧐=i, 🤓=n → \"In 1265,\"\n🤭=s, 🧐=i, 🐮=m, 🐨=o, 🤓=n → \"Simon\"\n🥳=d, 🐷=e → \"de\"\n🐮=m, 🐨=o, 🤓=n, 🥶=t, 😴=f, 🐨=o, 🐶=r, 🥶=t → \"Montfort\"\n6🥶=6t, 🤖=h, 🐷=e → \"6th the\"\n🐷=e, 🦆=a, 🐶=r, l → \"earl\"\n🐨=o, 😴=f → \"of\"\nl, 🐷=e, 🧐=i, c, 🐷=e, 🤭=s, 🥶=t, 🐷=e, 🐶=r → \"Leicester\"\n🤭=s, 🐱=u, 🐮=m, 🐮=m, 🐨=o, 🤓=n, 🐷=e, 🥳=d → \"summoned\"\n🥶=t, 🤖=h, 🐷=e → \"the\"\n😴=f, 🧐=i, 🐶=r, 🤭=s, 🥶=t → \"first\"\n🐷=e, l, 🐷=e, c, 🥶=t, 🐷=e, 🥳=d → \"elected\"\n🦉=p, 🦆=a, 🐶=r, l, 🧐=i, 🦆=a, 🐮=m, 🐷=e, 🤓=n, 🥶=t → \"parliament\"\n\nYes! That makes sense. So the emojis are:\n\n🧐=i, 🤓=n, 🤭=s, 🐮=m, 🐨=o, 🥳=d, 🐷=e, 🥶=t, 😴=f, 🐶=r, 🦆=a, 🤖=h, 🐱=u, 🦉=p.\n\nLet's check if these are all covered and not conflicting with previous feedback. All previous incorrect guesses are not in this list. For example, attempt 5 had 🐱=a (feedback: False), so 🐱=u is new. All other guesses here are new and fit the sentence.\n\nTo solve the Crypto Word Game, we analyze the encoded sentence, known hints, and feedback from previous attempts. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Confirmed from History:\n- 🐷=e (given hint)\n- 🐨=o (Attempt 4 correct)\n- 🥶=t (Attempt 5 correct)\n- 😴=f (Attempt 5 correct)\n- 🤖=h (Attempt 5 correct)\n- 🦉=p (Attempts 3 & 5 correct)\n\n### Deductions from the Encoded Sentence:\n1. **First phrase: 🧐🤓 1265**  \n   This likely represents \"In 1265\" (a year), so 🧐=i and 🤓=n.\n\n2. **Phrase: 🤭🧐🐮o🤓 🥳e**  \n   With 🧐=i, 🤓=n, and 🐨=o, this becomes \"[🤭]imon [🥳]e\". Historical context suggests \"Simon de\", so 🤭=s and 🥳=d.\n\n3. **Phrase: 🐮o🤓t f o🐶t**  \n   With 🐨=o, 🤓=n, and 😴=f, this becomes \"mo[n]t fo[🐶]t\". \"Montfort\" (a historical figure) fits, so 🐮=m and 🐶=r.\n\n4. **Phrase: 🐷🦆🐶l**  \n   With 🐷=e and 🐶=r, this becomes \"e[🦆]rl\". \"Earl\" (a title) fits, so 🦆=a.\n\n5. **Phrase: l🐷🧐c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶**  \n   With 🐷=e, 🧐=i, 🤭=s, 🥶=t, and 🐶=r, this becomes \"leiceste[r]\". \"Leicester\" (a city) fits.\n\n6. **Phrase: 🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓🐷🥳**  \n   With 🤭=s, 🐮=m, 🐨=o, 🤓=n, 🐷=e, and 🥳=d, this becomes \"s[🐱]mmoned\". \"Summoned\" fits, so 🐱=u.\n\n### Final Guesses:\nAll confirmed and deduced mappings align with the encoded sentence and historical context.\n\nAnswer: 🧐=i,🤓=n,🤭=s,🐮=m,🐨=o,🥳=d,🐷=e,🥶=t,😴=f,🐶=r,🦆=a,🤖=h,🐱=u,🦉=p"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The encoded sentence is given, and we know that 🤩=r. First, I need to look at the structure of the sentence and see where 🤩 appears. Let's start by listing all the emojis and their positions.\n\nThe encoded sentence is:\n🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈 🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩 d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺 😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d 🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d t🥴🤑 😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑 🐸🤩🐻🤖 🤩🐻t🥴 in 1967 🐸🐻🤩 🦊😴 $750.00.\n\nFirst, note that \"in 1967\" and \"$750.00\" are in plain text, so they might be helpful. Let's split the sentence into words separated by spaces:\n\n1. 🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈\n2. 🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑\n3. 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩\n4. d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺\n5. 😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d\n6. 🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d\n7. t🥴🤑\n8. 😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑\n9. 🐸🤩🐻🤖\n10. 🤩🐻t🥴\n11. in\n12. 1967\n13. 🐸🐻🤩\n14. 🦊😴\n15. $750.00\n\nWe know 🤩=r. Let's replace 🤩 with r in all words:\n\n3. 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑r\n4. d🤔rr🤧🥺\n5. 😴t🤔r🙄ir d (maybe a space? Let's check original: \"😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d\" becomes \"😴t🤔r🙄ir d\" — perhaps \"😴t🤔r🙄ird\" with a space? Maybe not, need to check the original structure. The original word 5 is \"😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d\", so with 🤩=r, it's \"😴t🤔r🙄ird\" (since two r's: positions 3 and 6). So \"😴t🤔r🙄ird\".\n\n6. 🐭🦊r🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d\n9. 🐸r🐻🤖\n10. r🐻t🥴\n13. 🐸🐻r\n\nLet's look for common words. The word \"in\" is plain, so maybe other short words. Let's check word 7: \"t🥴🤑\" — that's a 3-letter word starting with t. Possible 3-letter words: the, tnt, but, etc. Maybe \"the\" if 🥴=h and 🤑=e? Let's tentatively say t🥴🤑=the → 🥴=h, 🤑=e. Let's check that.\n\nIf 🤑=e, let's replace 🤑 with e in all words:\n\n1. 🐸e🥺🥺🐻😈\n2. 🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎e\n3. 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖ize r (since 🤑=e, so \"iz🤑🤩\" becomes \"ize r\" → \"izer\"? So word 3 is \"🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖izer\" — maybe \"somethingizer\"? Like \"realizer\"? Let's hold that thought.\n\n4. d🤔rr🤧🥺\n5. 😴t🤔r🙄ird\n6. 🐭🦊r🤗h🤔😴ed (since 🥴=h from word 7, and 🤑=e, so \"🥴🤔😴🤑d\" becomes \"h🤔😴ed\" → \"h?ed\". So \"🐭🦊r🤗h🤔😴ed\" → maybe \"somethingr?hed?ed\".\n\n7. t h e → the (if correct)\n8. 😎e h i 🤗🥺e → \"😎ehi🤗🥺e\" — if 🥴=h, then \"🥴i\" is \"hi\". So \"😎ehi🤗🥺e\" → maybe \"maybe\" if parts fit, but let's see.\n\nWord 13: 🐸🐻r. If \"in 1967 🐸🐻r 🦊😴 $750.00.\" So after \"in 1967\" there's a word 🐸🐻r, then 🦊😴, then $750.00. Maybe this is a date or a person. For example, \"in 1967 [Name] [something] $750.00\". If 🐸🐻r is a name like \"Baker\", \"Maker\", \"Taker\", etc. Let's think.\n\nWord 9: 🐸r🐻🤖. If 🐸🐻r is, say, \"Baker\", then 🐸r🐻🤖 could be \"Bark...\" (if 🐻=k, then 🐸r🐻🤖=Bark + something). Let's suppose 🐻=k. Let's test that.\n\nIf 🐻=k, then:\n\nWord 1: 🐸e🥺🥺k😈 → \"🐸e??k?\" (maybe a 6-letter word, perhaps \"Beeper\" but no, 6 letters. Let's check other words.\n\nWord 2: 🤔🦊t k 🤖k ti 😎e → \"🤔🦊t k 🤖k ti 😎e\" → maybe \"somethingt k ...k ti ...e\". Let's split into parts: \"🤔🦊t\" (maybe a prefix), then \"k\", then \"🤖k\" (maybe \"ick\"? like \"sick\" if 🤖=i), then \"ti\" (maybe \"ti\" as in \"tiger\", \"tibia\"), then \"😎e\" (maybe \"be\" if 😎=b). Let's suppose 😎=b, so \"😎e\"=be. Then word 2: \"🤔🦊t k i k ti be\" → \"🤔🦊tkik ti be\" → perhaps \"Mightkik ti be\" (unlikely). Alternatively, \"🤔🦊t\" could be \"that\" if 🤔=t, 🦊=h, but \"t h t\" → \"tht\" which is not. Maybe \"what\" → 🤔=w, 🦊=h, t. \"w h t\" → \"wht\" → \"what\" would be w h a t, but here it's \"🤔🦊t\" which is 3 characters (🤔, 🦊, t). So 3 letters. Maybe \"the\" → t h e, but \"t\" is already in the word. Hmm.\n\nWord 10: r k t h → \"rkt h\" → \"rkt h\" → maybe \"r k t h\" → \"ruth\"? If t h is \"th\", then \"r k t h\" could be \"ruth\" (r u t h), but that would mean 🐻=u. Wait, earlier I thought 🐻=k, but maybe that's wrong. Let's think again.\n\nWord 10: 🤩🐻t🥴 → r 🐻 t h (since 🥴=h). So \"r 🐻 t h\". Possible 4-letter words ending with \"th\": \"rath\", \"roth\", \"math\", \"path\", \"rath\", \"roth\", \"breathe\" but 4 letters. \"rath\" (r a t h), \"roth\" (r o t h), \"math\" (m a t h). So maybe 🐻=a → \"rath\", or 🐻=o → \"roth\", or 🐻=m → \"math\". Let's suppose 🐻=a. Then \"rath\".\n\nWord 13: 🐸🐻r → 🐸 a r → \"bar\" (if 🐸=b), \"car\" (c), \"far\" (f), \"mar\" (m), etc. Let's say \"car\" (🐸=c). Then 🐸=c, 🐻=a, so word 13 is \"car\". Then \"in 1967 car 🦊😴 $750.00.\" Maybe \"in 1967 car cost $750.00\" → \"cost\" would be 🦊😴. So 🦊😴=co (since \"cost\" is c o s t, but \"cost\" is 4 letters. Wait, \"🦊😴\" is two emojis, so two letters. If \"cost\" is 4 letters, maybe \"price\" → \"price\" is 5 letters. Alternatively, \"sold for $750.00\". Let's see, \"in 1967 car [sold] $750.00\". \"sold\" is 4 letters. But \"🦊😴\" is two letters, so perhaps \"was\" (w a s). Maybe \"in 1967 car was $750.00\" → \"was\" would be 🦊😴=w a. But let's check other words.\n\nWord 9: 🐸🤩🐻🤖 → c r a 🤖 → \"c r a 🤖\". If it's \"crab\", then 🤖=b. So 🤖=b. Let's try that. Then word 9: crab.\n\nWord 2: 🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑 → 🤔 🦊 t a b a t i 😎 e. Let's split into letters: [🤔][🦊][t][a][b][a][t][i][😎][e]. That's 10 characters. Let's see, maybe \"manufacture\" (m a n u f a c t u r e) but not. Alternatively, \"something like \"m a t a b a t i b e\" → no. Maybe \"thatabatie\"? Not likely. Let's think of word 3: 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩 → 🤗 🦊 😴 t a b i z e r. \"t a b i z\" → \"tabiz\" (maybe a typo for \"tabriz\"? No). \"iz e r\" → \"izer\" (like \"realizer\", \"organizer\"). So \"🤗🦊😴t a b i z e r\" → \"somethingt abizer\"? Maybe \"advertizer\" (advertiser) → a d v e r t i s e r. Let's see: advertiser is a d v e r t i s e r. The word 3 has 10 characters (emojis and letters): 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩 → 10 characters: [🤗][🦊][😴][t][🐻][🤖][i][z][🤑][🤩] → letters: [🤗][🦊][😴][t][a][b][i][z][e][r]. So \"advertiser\" would be a d v e r t i s e r. Let's check: a (🤗=a), d (🦊=d), v (😴=v), t (t), e (🐻=e?), r (but earlier we thought 🐻=a, conflicting). Maybe I need to adjust.\n\nLet's try another approach. The word \"d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺\" (word 4) with 🤩=r becomes \"d🤔rr🤧🥺\". Let's assume it's a 6-letter word. Common 6-letter words with \"rr\": \"carrot\", \"carry\", \"borrow\", \"mirror\", \"barrel\", etc. Let's take \"mirror\": m i r r o r. But \"d\" starts the word, so \"d\" + 5 letters. \"drama\" no, \"dinner\" (d i n n e r) has two n's. \"dresser\" (d r e s s e r) has two s's. \"dinner\" is 6 letters: d i n n e r. If \"d🤔rr🤧🥺\" = \"dinner\", then 🤔=i, 🧧=e, 🥺=r. Let's check: d i r r e r → dinner? Yes! Because \"d i r r e r\" is dinner (d-i-n-n-e-r). Wait, no: dinner is d-i-n-n-e-r. So \"d🤔rr🤧🥺\" would need to be d i n n e r. So 🤔=n, 🧧=e, 🥺=r. Let's check:\n\nd (d) 🤔(n) r(r) r(r) 🧧(e) 🥺(r) → d n r r e r → dnr rer? No, that's not dinner. Alternatively, \"dresser\" (d r e s s e r) is 7 letters. \"dribble\" (d r i b b l e) no. \"dread\" (d r e a d) 5 letters. Maybe \"driver\": d r i v e r (6 letters). So \"d🤔rr🤧🥺\" = driver. Then:\n\nd (d) 🤔(i) r(r) r(r) 🧧(v) 🥺(e) → d i r r v e → dirrve? No. \"driver\" is d r i v e r. So positions: d (1), r(2), i(3), v(4), e(5), r(6). So \"d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺\" would be d (1) 🤔(2) r(3) r(4) 🧧(5) 🥺(6). So if \"driver\", then:\n\n🤔(2) = r (since position 2 is r), but position 3 is r (🤩=r), which would make 🤔=r, but 🤩 is already r. Each emoji is unique, so that's not possible.\n\nAnother 6-letter word: \"bitter\" (b i t t e r). Starts with b, not d. \"better\" (b e t t e r). No. \"letter\" (l e t t e r). No. \"matter\" (m a t t e r). No. \"titter\" (t i t t e r). No. \"udder\" (u d d e r). No. \"udder\" is 5 letters. \"udder\" → u d d e r (5 letters). \"daddy\" (d a d d y). No.\n\nLet's look at word 5: \"😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d\" → 😴 t 🤔 r 🙄 i r d. Let's split into letters: [😴][t][🤔][r][🙄][i][r][d]. So 8 letters. Maybe \"straight\" (s t r a i g h t). Let's check: s t r a i g h t. So positions:\n\n😴=s, t=t, 🤔=r, r=r (but 🤩=r, so 🤔 can't be r), so that's conflicting. Alternatively, \"stranger\": s t r a n g e r. 8 letters. s t r a n g e r. So:\n\n😴=s, t=t, 🤔=r (again conflict), r=r, 🙄=n, i=i, r=r, d=e? No, \"stranger\" ends with r. Alternatively, \"street\" (s t r e e t) is 6 letters. \"s t r e e t d\" → no. \"stirred\": s t i r r e d. 7 letters. s t i r r e d. So:\n\n😴=s, t=t, 🤔=i, r=r, 🙄=r (but r is already 🤩), i=i, r=r, d=d. So \"s t i r r e d\" → \"stirred\" (s t i r r e d). That fits! Let's check:\n\nword 5: 😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d → s t i r r e r d? No. \"stirred\" is s t i r r e d (7 letters). So positions 1-7: [s][t][i][r][r][e][d]. So the word would be \"stirred\". Let's map:\n\n😴=s, t=t, 🤔=i, 🤩=r (given), 🙄=r? No, because 🤩=r, and emojis are unique. So 🙄 can't be r. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, \"startled\": s t a r t l e d (8 letters). s t a r t l e d. So:\n\n😴=s, t=t, 🤔=a, 🤩=r, 🙄=t, i=l, 🤩=r, d=d. That would be s t a r t l e d → \"startled\". Let's check the positions:\n\n[s][t][a][r][t][l][r][d] → \"startlrd\" → not \"startled\". Hmm.\n\nLet's look at word 14: 🦊😴. If the sentence ends with \"in 1967 🐸🐻🤩 🦊😴 $750.00.\" So \"in 1967 [X] [Y] $750.00\". [X] is 🐸🐻🤩 → 3 emojis, so 3 letters (since 🤩=r). So [X] is 3 letters: [🐸][🐻][r]. [Y] is 🦊😴 → 2 letters. Maybe \"in 1967 car cost $750.00\" → [X]=car (c a r), [Y]=co (c o). So [X]=car → 🐸=c, 🐻=a, 🤩=r (given). [Y]=co → 🦊=c (but 🐸 is c, conflict), no. Alternatively, \"in 1967 Ford cost $750.00\" → [X]=Ford (but 4 letters, 🐸🐻🤩 is 3 letters). \"in 1967 bike cost...\" → bike is 4 letters. \"in 1967 toy cost...\" → toy (t o y) → [X]=toy (t o y), [Y]=co (c o). So [X] would be 🐸=t, 🐻=o, 🤩=y (but 🤩 is given as r, so no). So [X] must be 3 letters ending with r (since 🤩=r). So \"bar\", \"car\", \"far\", \"mar\", \"par\", \"tar\", \"war\".\n\nLet's assume [X]=car (c a r), so 🐸=c, 🐻=a, 🤩=r (given). Then word 13: 🐸🐻🤩=car. Then [Y]=🦊😴. If the sentence is \"in 1967 car [Y] $750.00\", [Y] could be \"cost\" (4 letters, but [Y] is 2 letters). Alternatively, \"sold\" (4 letters). \"priced\" (6 letters). \"was\" (3 letters, but [Y] is 2 letters). \"at\" (2 letters): \"in 1967 car at $750.00\". That makes sense. So [Y]=at → 🦊=a (but 🐻=a, conflict), no. \"for\" (3 letters). \"in 1967 car for $750.00\" → [Y]=for (3 letters, but [Y] is 2 letters). \"in 1967 car [Y] $750.00\" → [Y] could be \"sold\" (4 letters), but [Y] is 2 letters. Maybe \"in 1967 car [priced] $750.00\" → no. Alternatively, \"in 1967 car [cost] $750.00\" → \"cost\" is 4 letters, but [Y] is 2 letters. Maybe [Y] is \"at\" (a t), so 🦊=a, 😴=t. But [Y] would be \"at\". Let's check:\n\nIf 🦊=a, 😴=t, then word 14: 🦊😴=at. Then word 3: 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩 → 🤗 a t t a 🤖 i z 🤑 r. Let's split: [🤗][a][t][t][a][🤖][i][z][🤑][r]. That's 10 characters. Maybe \"advertizer\" (advertiser) → a d v e r t i s e r. But \"advertiser\" is 10 letters. Let's check:\n\na (🤗=a), d (no, 🦊 is a), v (😴=t), e (🐻=a), r (t), t (t), i (i), s (🤖=s), e (🤑=e), r (r). So \"a t t a s i z e r\" → \"attasizer\" → not a word. Alternatively, \"assistant\" → no.\n\nLet's look at word 1: 🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈 → c 🤑 🥺 🥺 a 😈. 6 letters. Maybe \"creek\" (c r e e k) but 5 letters. \"coffee\" (c o f f e e) → 6 letters. c o f f e e. So if 🤑=o, 🥺=f, 😈=e. Then word 1: c o f f a e → \"coffae\" → no. \"cookie\" (c o o k i e) → 6 letters. c o o k i e. So 🤑=o, 🥺=o (but emojis are unique, so no). \"candle\" (c a n d l e) → 6 letters. c a n d l e. But 🐻=a, so c a n d l e → \"c a 🥺 🥺 a 😈\" → \"ca??ae\". Maybe \"cater\" (5 letters). No.\n\nLet's try word 8: 😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑 → 😎 🤑 🥴 i 🤗 🥺 🤑. 7 letters. If we assume 🤑=e (from word 7: t🥴🤑=the → 🥴=h, 🤑=e). Then word 8: 😎 e h i 🤗 🥺 e. 7 letters. Maybe \"behaving\" (b e h a v i n g) → no. \"beneath\" (b e n e a t h) → no. \"before\" (b e f o r e) → 6 letters. \"because\" (b e c a u s e) → 7 letters. Let's check: b e c a u s e. So 😎=b, 🥴=c (but earlier we thought 🥴=h, conflicting), no. Alternatively, \"believe\" (b e l i e v e) → 7 letters. b e l i e v e. So 😎=b, 🥴=l, 🤗=e (but 🤑=e, conflict), no. \"between\" (b e t w e e n) → 7 letters. No.\n\nLet's go back to the hint: 🤩=r. We need to include this in our answer. Also, since it's the first attempt, we can make guesses. Let's list possible emojis and their possible letters based on the structure.\n\nKnown: 🤩=r.\n\nLet's look at word 10: 🤩🐻t🥴 → r 🐻 t 🥴. If this is a 4-letter word, maybe \"rest\" (r e s t) → 🐻=e, 🥴=s. Let's try that. Then word 7: t🥴🤑 → t s 🤑. 3 letters. \"its\" → i t s, but starts with t. \"the\" → t h e. If \"t s 🤑\" is \"the\", then 🥴=h (conflict with previous), no. \"tst\" → no. \"tad\" → t a d. Not helpful.\n\nAnother 4-letter word: \"roth\" (r o t h) → 🐻=o, 🥴=h. Then word 7: t h 🤑 → 3 letters. \"the\" → t h e → 🤑=e. That works! So 🥴=h, 🤑=e. Let's proceed with that.\n\nSo:\n\n🤩=r (given)\n\n🥴=h\n\n🤑=e\n\nWord 7: t h e → the. Correct.\n\nWord 10: r o t h → roth (assuming 🐻=o). Let's say 🐻=o.\n\nWord 13: 🐸🐻🤩 → 🐸 o r. 3 letters. Maybe \"for\" (f o r) → 🐸=f.\n\nWord 9: 🐸🤩🐻🤖 → f r o 🤖. 4 letters. \"from\" (f r o m) → 🤖=m. So 🤖=m.\n\nWord 2: 🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑 → 🤔 🦊 t o m o t i 😎 e. Let's split into letters: [🤔][🦊][t][o][m][o][t][i][😎][e]. 10 letters. Maybe \"something\" like \"promotion\" (p r o m o t i o n) → but 9 letters. \"proposition\" (p r o p o s i t i o n) → 11 letters. \"population\" (p o p u l a t i o n) → no. \"motivation\" (m o t i v a t i o n) → no. Let's see: [🤔][🦊][t][o][m][o][t][i][😎][e] → \"? ? t o m o t i ? e\". Maybe \"compromise\" (c o m p r o m i s e) → 10 letters. Let's check: c o m p r o m i s e. So positions:\n\n[🤔=c][🦊=o][t=t][o=o][m=m][o=o][t=t][i=i][😎=s][e=e]. So \"c o t o m o t i s e\" → \"cotomotide\"? No. \"compromise\" is c o m p r o m i s e. So positions 1-10: c o m p r o m i s e. Let's map:\n\n[🤔=c][🦊=o][t=t][o=o][m=m][r=r (but 🤩=r, so 🐻=o, which is correct), o=o][m=m][i=i][s=s (😎=s)][e=e]. So \"c o t o m o t i s e\" → \"cotomotide\" no. Not matching.\n\nWord 3: 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩 → 🤗 o 😴 t o m i z e r. 10 letters. \"organizer\" (o r g a n i z e r) → 9 letters. \"originizer\" (no). \"operator\" (o p e r a t o r) → 8 letters. \"optimizer\" (o p t i m i z e r) → 10 letters. Let's check: o p t i m i z e r. So:\n\n[🤗=o][🦊=p][😴=t][t=t][o=o][m=m][i=i][z=z][e=e][r=r]. So \"o p t t o m i z e r\" → \"opptomizer\"? No. \"optimizer\" is o p t i m i z e r. So letters: o p t i m i z e r (9 letters). The word 3 has 10 characters (emojis and letters): [🤗][🦊][😴][t][🐻][🤖][i][z][🤑][🤩] → o p t t o m i z e r → 10 letters: o p t t o m i z e r. Maybe \"opportunizer\" (no). Not helpful.\n\nWord 4: d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺 → d 🤔 r r 🧧 🥺. 6 letters. If \"dinner\" (d i n n e r), then:\n\nd i n n e r → 🤔=i, 🧧=e, 🥺=r. But 🤩=r, so 🥺=r would conflict. Each emoji is unique, so 🥺 can't be r. So \"dinner\" is out. \"driver\" (d r i v e r) → d r i v e r. So:\n\nd r i v e r → 🤔=r (but 🤩=r, conflict). No. \"dresser\" (d r e s s e r) → 7 letters. \"drama\" (d r a m a) → 5 letters. \"drink\" (d r i n k) → 5 letters.\n\nWord 5: 😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d → 😴 t 🤔 r 🙄 i r d. 8 letters. Let's assume 😴=s (since \"s\" is common). Then \"s t 🤔 r 🙄 i r d\". Maybe \"straight\" (s t r a i g h t) → 8 letters. s t r a i g h t. So:\n\ns t r a i g h t → 🤔=r (conflict with 🤩=r), no. \"stranger\" (s t r a n g e r) → 8 letters. s t r a n g e r. So:\n\ns t r a n g e r → 🤔=r (conflict), no. \"stirred\" (s t i r r e d) → 7 letters. s t i r r e d. So:\n\ns t i r r e d → 😴=s, t=t, 🤔=i, 🙄=r (conflict), i=i, r=r, d=d. No.\n\nLet's try to make a guess. We know 🤩=r. Let's include that. Also, maybe 🤑=e (from word 7: t🥴🤑=the → t h e). So 🥴=h, 🤑=e. Let's guess:\n\n🤩=r, 🤑=e, 🥴=h.\n\nOther possible guesses: Maybe 🐻=o (from word 10: r o t h). 🐸=f (from word 13: f o r). 🤖=m (from word 9: f r o m). Let's include those.\n\nSo possible guesses:\n\n🤩=r, 🤑=e, 🥴=h, 🐻=o, 🐸=f, 🤖=m.\n\nLet's check word 9: 🐸🤩🐻🤖 → f r o m → \"from\" which makes sense. That's a good fit.\n\nWord 10: 🤩🐻t🥴 → r o t h → \"roth\". Maybe a name.\n\nWord 13: 🐸🐻🤩 → f o r → \"for\". So \"in 1967 for 🦊😴 $750.00.\" That could work. Maybe \"in 1967 for sale $750.00\" → \"sale\" would be 🦊😴=s a. So 🦊=s, 😴=a.\n\nWord 3: 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩 → 🤗 s a t o m i z e r → \"satomizer\"? No, \"atomizer\" (a t o m i z e r) → 9 letters. If 🤗=a, then \"a s a t o m i z e r\" → \"asatomizer\" → no. \"atomizer\" is a t o m i z e r. So maybe 🦊=a, 😴=t → 🦊😴=a t. Then word 3: 🤗 a t t o m i z e r → \"attomizer\" → no. \"automizer\" (a u t o m i z e r) → 10 letters. \"a u t o m i z e r\" → \"automizer\" (a brand maybe). So 🤗=a, 🦊=u, 😴=t. Then word 3: a u t t o m i z e r → \"autotomizer\"? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, word 2: 🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑 → 🤔 🦊 t o m o t i 😎 e. If \"motivate\" (m o t i v a t e) → 8 letters. \"m o t i v a t e\" → \"m o t i v a t e\" → 8 letters. But word 2 has 10 characters. Maybe \"promotion\" (p r o m o t i o n) → 9 letters. \"p r o m o t i o n\" → 9 letters. So 🤔=p, 🦊=r (but 🤩=r, conflict), no.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's list the emojis present and try to guess based on frequency. The emojis are: 🐸, 🤑, 🥺, 🐻, 😈, 🤔, 🦊, t, 🤖, ti, 😎, 🤗, 😴, iz, d, 🤧, 🙄, i, 🐭, 🥴, in, 1967, $750.00. (Note: 't', 'ti', 'iz', 'd', 'i' are lowercase letters, not emojis. The emojis are the ones with symbols.)\n\nEmojis in the encoded sentence: 🐸, 🤑, 🥺, 🐻, 😈, 🤔, 🦊, 🤖, 😎, 🤗, 😴, 🤧, 🙄, 🐭, 🥴, 🤩.\n\nWe know 🤩=r. Let's list their frequencies:\n\n- 🥺 appears in word 1 (2x), word 4, word 8 → 4 times.\n- 🤩=r (given) appears in words 3,4,5,6,9,10,13 → 7 times (most frequent, which matches the hint).\n- 🐻 appears in words 1,2,3,9,10,13 → 6 times.\n- 🤑 appears in words 1,2,3,6,7,8 → 6 times.\n- 🤔 appears in words 2,4,5,6 → 4 times.\n- 🥴 appears in words 6,7,8,10 → 4 times.\n- 🦊 appears in words 2,3,6,14 → 4 times.\n- 😴 appears in words 3,5,6,14 → 4 times.\n- 🤖 appears in words 2,3,9 → 3 times.\n- 🐸 appears in words 1,9,13 → 3 times.\n- 🤗 appears in words 3,6,8 → 3 times.\n- 😎 appears in words 2,8 → 2 times.\n- 😈, 🤧, 🙄, 🐭 → 1 time each.\n\nSince 🤩 is the most frequent and is r, next frequent are 🐻 and 🤑 with 6 times each. Common letters are e, t, a, o, i, n, s, h, r, d, l, u. Since r is taken, next common is e. Let's guess 🤑=e (since it's frequent). Then, the word t🥴🤑 (word 7) is t🥴e. 3-letter words: the, tie, toe, tee, etc. Most common is 'the', so 🥴=h. So 🥴=h, 🤑=e.\n\nNow, word 7: t h e → the. Good.\n\nNext, 🐻 is frequent (6 times). Common letters: a, o, i, n, s. Let's guess 🐻=a (common). Then, word 10: 🤩🐻t🥴 → r a t h → \"rath\" (a valid word).\n\nWord 13: 🐸🐻🤩 → 🐸 a r. 3-letter words: car, bar, far, mar, par, tar, war. Let's guess 🐸=c (car). So 🐸=c, 🐻=a, 🤩=r.\n\nWord 9: 🐸🤩🐻🤖 → c r a 🤖. 4-letter words: crab, crib, crad, crap, etc. Let's guess 🤖=b (crab). So 🤖=b.\n\nWord 3: 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩 → 🤗🦊😴t a b i z e r. Let's split: [🤗][🦊][😴][t][a][b][i][z][e][r]. 10 letters. Maybe \"advertiser\" (a d v e r t i s e r). Let's check: a d v e r t i s e r. So:\n\n[🤗=a][🦊=d][😴=v][t=t][a=a][b=b][i=i][z=z][e=e][r=r]. That fits! So \"advertiser\".\n\nSo:\n\n🤗=a, 🦊=d, 😴=v.\n\nWord 3: a d v t a b i z e r → \"advtabizer\"? No, \"advertiser\" is a d v e r t i s e r. Oh, there's an 'e' missing. The original word 3 is \"🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩\", which is [🤗][🦊][😴][t][🐻][🤖][i][z][🤑][🤩] → [a][d][v][t][a][b][i][z][e][r] → \"advtabizer\" → maybe a typo, but \"advertiser\" is a d v e r t i s e r. So maybe the 'r' in \"advertiser\" is 🤩=r, which is correct. The 'e' is 🤑=e. So \"advertiser\" would be [a][d][v][e][r][t][i][s][e][r]. But the encoded word is [a][d][v][t][a][b][i][z][e][r]. So perhaps it's a different word. Let's proceed.\n\nWord 2: 🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑 → 🤔 d t a b a t i 😎 e. 10 letters. Maybe \"manufacture\" (m a n u f a c t u r e) → no. \"determinate\" (d e t e r m i n a t e) → no. \"databased\" (d a t a b a s e d) → 9 letters. \"databate\" (no).\n\nWord 4: d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺 → d 🤔 r r 🧧 🥺. 6 letters. If \"dinner\" (d i n n e r), then:\n\nd i n n e r → 🤔=i, 🧧=e, 🥺=r. But 🥺=r would conflict with 🤩=r (each emoji unique). So no. \"dresser\" (d r e s s e r) → 7 letters. \"driver\" (d r i v e r) → 6 letters. d r i v e r → 🤔=r (conflict), no. \"drama\" (d r a m a) → 5 letters.\n\nWord 5: 😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d → v t 🤔 r 🙄 i r d. 8 letters. Maybe \"voterird\" → no. \"vintage\" (v i n t a g e) → 7 letters. \"vibrant\" (v i b r a n t) → 7 letters.\n\nWord 6: 🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d → 🐭 d r a h 🤔 v e d. 8 letters. Maybe \"somethingd\".\n\nWord 8: 😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑 → 😎 e h i a 🥺 e. 7 letters. Maybe \"behavee\" (b e h a v e e) → no. \"beneathe\" (b e n e a t h) → 7 letters. \"beforee\" (no).\n\nWord 1: 🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈 → c e 🥺 🥺 a 😈. 6 letters. Maybe \"coffee\" (c o f f e e) → but 🤑=e, so c e f f a e → \"ceffae\" → no. \"candle\" (c a n d l e) → no. \"cater\" (c a t e r) → 5 letters.\n\nThis is challenging, but let's make some guesses based on the above. We have:\n\n🤩=r (given)\n\nAssumed:\n\n🤑=e, 🥴=h, 🐻=a, 🐸=c, 🤖=b, 🤗=a (but 🤗 can't be a if 🐻=a, since emojis are unique. Oops, 🤗 and 🐻 can't both be a. So that's a mistake. Let's correct: 🤗 can't be a if 🐻=a. Let's change 🤗=s.\n\nThen word 3: s d v t a b i z e r → \"sdvtabizer\" → no. Not helpful.\n\nAlternative approach: list all required emojis in the answer, including the hint. The answer must include 🤩=r and any other guesses. Let's make some initial guesses:\n\n🤩=r (required)\n\nMaybe 🤑=e (frequent), 🥴=h (from \"the\"), 🐻=a (frequent), 🐸=c (common), 🤖=b (common), 🦊=d (common), 😴=v (common), 🤗=s (common), 🤔=n (common), 🥺=f (common), 😎=k (common), 😈=m (common), 🤧=p (common), 🙄=l (common), 🐭=g (common).\n\nSo the guess would be:\n\n🤩=r, 🤑=e, 🥴=h, 🐻=a, 🐸=c, 🤖=b, 🦊=d, 😴=v, 🤗=s, 🤔=n, 🥺=f, 😎=k, 😈=m, 🤧=p, 🙄=l, 🐭=g.\n\nBut this is a lot. However, the user wants guesses in the format 'emoji=word', separated by commas, including the hint. So the minimal answer would include the hint and any other guesses. Since it's the first attempt, we can guess a few.\n\nLet's go with the most confident ones:\n\n🤩=r (given), 🤑=e (from \"the\" in word 7), 🥴=h (from \"the\"), 🐻=a (frequent), 🐸=c (3-letter word \"car\"), 🤖=b (4-letter word \"crab\").\n\nSo the answer would be:\n\nAnswer: 🤩=r, 🤑=e, 🥴=h, 🐻=a, 🐸=c, 🤖=b\n\n\n\nTo solve the Crypto Word Game, we start by analyzing the encoded sentence and the given hint that 🤩=r. We then look for patterns, common word structures, and high-frequency emojis to make educated guesses. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Hint**: 🤩=r (most frequent emoji, as specified).  \n2. **Word 7**: \"t🥴🤑\" is a 3-letter word. Common 3-letter words starting with \"t\" include \"the,\" suggesting 🥴=h and 🤑=e (since \"the\" is a common word).  \n3. **Word 10**: \"🤩🐻t🥴\" becomes \"r🐻th\" with the known values. A plausible 4-letter word is \"rath,\" implying 🐻=a.  \n4. **Word 13**: \"🐸🐻🤩\" becomes \"🐸ar\" with the known values. A common 3-letter word is \"car,\" suggesting 🐸=c.  \n5. **Word 9**: \"🐸🤩🐻🤖\" becomes \"cr🤖\" with the known values. A plausible 4-letter word is \"crab,\" implying 🤖=b.  \n\n\n### Guesses:\n- 🤩=r (given hint).  \n- 🤑=e (from \"the\" in word 7).  \n- 🥴=h (from \"the\" in word 7).  \n- 🐻=a (from \"rath\" in word 10).  \n- 🐸=c (from \"car\" in word 13).  \n- 🤖=b (from \"crab\" in word 9).  \n\n\nAnswer: 🤩=r, 🤑=e, 🥴=h, 🐻=a, 🐸=c, 🤖=b","Okay, let's try to figure this out step by step. First, let's recap what we know. The encoded sentence is given, and we have some feedback from the first attempt. The hint is that 🤩=r, and the first guess had some correct and incorrect emojis.\n\nFrom the history, the first guess was 🤩=r (correct), 🤑=e (correct), 🥴=h (correct), 🐻=a (incorrect), 🐸=c (incorrect), 🤖=b (incorrect). So the correct ones we must include are 🤩=r, 🤑=e, 🥴=h.\n\nLet's start by substituting the known emojis into the encoded sentence. Let's replace 🤑 with e, 🥴 with h, 🤩 with r. Let's look at the sentence:\n\nOriginal: 🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈 🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩 d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺 😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d 🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d t🥴🤑 😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑 🐸🤩🐻🤖 🤩🐻t🥴 in 1967 🐸🐻🤩 🦊😴 $750.00.\n\nAfter substituting knowns (🤑=e, 🥴=h, 🤩=r):\n\n🐸e🥺🥺🐻😈 🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎e 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz er d🤔rr🤧🥺 😴t🤔r🙄ir d 🐭🦊r🤗h🤔😴ed the 😎eh i🤗🥺e 🐸r🐻🤖 r🐻th in 1967 🐸🐻r 🦊😴 $750.00.\n\nLet's look for patterns and possible words. Let's break down parts of the sentence.\n\nFirst part: \"t🥴🤑\" becomes \"th e\" (since t🥴🤑 is t + h + e). Oh, \"the\" is a common word! So \"t🥴🤑\" is \"the\" which matches t + h + e. That's correct, so that part checks out.\n\nNext, \"in 1967 🐸🐻🤩\" would be \"in 1967 [emoji1][emoji2]r\". The word here is likely a proper noun, maybe a company or a person. Let's think about 1967 and $750.00. Maybe it's a price, like a purchase.\n\nLooking at \"🤩🐻t🥴\" which is \"r🐻th\". That could be \"roth\" (a name), or \"rath\", \"ruth\" (but \"t🥴\" is \"th\", so \"r[emoji2]th\". If the previous part was \"in 1967 [emoji1][emoji2]r\", maybe \"Carr\" (but 🐸 was guessed as c before and was wrong, so 🐸 isn't c). Or \"Darr\", \"Barr\", etc.\n\nAnother part: \"d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺\" is \"d🤔rr🤧🥺\". Let's see. The structure is d + [emoji] + r + r + [emoji] + [emoji]. Maybe \"dinner\" (d-i-n-n-e-r), but \"d🤔rr🤧🥺\" would need 6 letters. \"dinner\" is 6 letters. So d i n n e r. So \"d🤔rr🤧🥺\" could be \"dinner\". Then 🤔 would be i, 🧧 would be e, 🥺 would be r. Wait, but 🤩 is already r. So if \"dinner\" is the word, then:\n\nd (d) + 🤔 (i) + r (r) + r (r) + 🧧 (n) + 🥺 (e) → \"dinner\"? Let's check. \"d i r r n e\"? No, that's \"dirrne\" which isn't right. Maybe \"dresser\"? No. Let's think of other 6-letter words starting with d and having two r's. \"Drama\"? No, only one r. \"Drier\" (d-r-i-e-r) but that's 5 letters. \"Drooper\"? No. Alternatively, \"d\" + [letter] + \"rr\" + [two letters]. Maybe \"d\" + \"e\" + \"rr\" + \"or\" → \"derror\"? Not a word. Hmm.\n\nLooking at \"😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d\" → \"😴t🤔r🙄ir d\". Let's split that. Maybe \"what is it\" but not sure. The \"ir d\" at the end could be \"ird\" like \"bird\" but not. Let's look at \"😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑\" → \"😎eh i🤗🥺e\". \"😎ehi🤗🥺e\". Maybe \"shehi...e\"? \"Sh\" as a start? \"Shehi...\" Maybe \"shehikes\"? No. Or \"theh...\".\n\nAnother part: \"🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩\" → \"🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖ize r\". \"ize r\" could be \"izer\" as in \"organizer\" or \"realizer\". Let's see, \"ize\" is a common suffix. So \"🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖ize r\". If the word ends with \"izer\", then \"ize\" would be \"ize\", so \"iz🤑\" is \"ize\" (since 🤑=e). Oh, \"iz🤑\" is \"ize\" (i-z-e), so \"iz🤑\" → \"ize\". That makes sense. So \"iz🤑\" is \"ize\", which fits with 🤑=e. So \"iz🤑\" is \"ize\".\n\nSo \"🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩\" → \"🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖izer\". So \"izer\" is at the end, so the word could be something like \"organizer\" (o-r-g-a-n-i-z-e-r). Let's check: o (🤗) + r (🦊?) + g (😴) + a (t🐻? Maybe t is a letter, like \"t\" is a typo? Wait, the encoded sentence has some lowercase letters: \"t\", \"ti\", \"iz\", \"d\", \"i\", \"in\", \"1967\", \"$750.00\". Oh, wait, maybe the original sentence has some lowercase letters that are not encoded, like \"t\" is just the letter t, \"i\" is the letter i, etc. Oh! That's a key point. The problem says \"each letter with a unique emoji\" but perhaps some letters (like t, i, z, d, etc.) are not replaced by emojis and are kept as lowercase. That's possible. Let's check.\n\nLooking at the encoded sentence: \"🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑\" → has \"t\", \"ti\" (t and i), \"iz\" (i and z) in \"iz🤑🤩\" (iz + 🤑 + 🤩 → iz + e + r → izer). So \"iz\" is i and z, which are lowercase letters, not emojis. So the emojis are replacing uppercase letters, and lowercase letters are as is. That's a crucial insight. So \"t\", \"i\", \"z\", \"d\", \"h\", \"e\", \"r\" (from the knowns) are lowercase letters. Wait, but \"r\" is from 🤩=r, which is an emoji. So maybe the lowercase letters are part of the original sentence and not encoded. So the emojis replace the uppercase letters. Let's re-examine.\n\nLet's parse the encoded sentence with this in mind. Let's list all parts, separating emojis and lowercase letters:\n\nEncoded Sentence parts (emojis and lowercase letters):\n\n1. 🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈 → emojis only\n2. 🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑 → emojis (🤔, 🦊, 🐻, 🤖, 😎) and lowercase (t, ti)\n3. 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩 → emojis (🤗, 🦊, 😴, 🐻, 🤖) and lowercase (t, iz)\n4. d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺 → lowercase (d) and emojis (🤔, 🤩, 🧧, 🥺)\n5. 😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d → emojis (😴, 🤔, 🤩, 🙄) and lowercase (t, i, d)\n6. 🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d → emojis (🐭, 🦊, 🤩, 🤗, 🥴, 🤔, 😴, 🤑) and lowercase (d)\n7. t🥴🤑 → lowercase (t) and emojis (🥴, 🤑) → which we know is t + h + e → \"the\"\n8. 😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑 → emojis (😎, 🤑, 🥴, 🤗, 🥺) and lowercase (i)\n9. 🐸🤩🐻🤖 → emojis (🐸, 🤩, 🐻, 🤖)\n10. 🤩🐻t🥴 → emojis (🤩, 🐻) and lowercase (t, 🥴) → r + [emoji] + t + h → \"r[X]th\"\n11. in 1967 → lowercase\n12. 🐸🐻🤩 → emojis (🐸, 🐻, 🤩)\n13. 🦊😴 → emojis (🦊, 😴)\n14. $750.00 → symbols\n\nSo \"t🥴🤑\" is \"t\" (lowercase) + 🥴 (h) + 🤑 (e) → \"the\", which is correct. That's a good anchor.\n\nLet's look at part 7: \"t🥴🤑\" → \"the\". Correct.\n\nPart 6: \"🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d\" → [emoji] + [emoji] + r (🤩) + [emoji] + h (🥴) + [emoji] + [emoji] + e (🤑) + d (lowercase). Let's think of a word ending with \"ed\" (since \"🤑d\" is e + d → \"ed\"). So \"🐭🦊r🤗h🤔😴ed\". Maybe \"somethinged\"? Like \"published\"? Let's see: p (🐭) + u (🦊) + b (r? No, r is already 🤩) → No. \"reported\"? r is already taken. \"recorded\"? No. \"registered\"? r (🤩) is part of it. \"registered\" is r-e-g-i-s-t-e-r-e-d. No, not matching. Maybe \"arranged\"? a-r-r-a-n-g-e-d. Not matching. Alternatively, \"somethinged\" where the structure is [X][Y]r[Z]h[W][V]ed.\n\nPart 3: \"🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩\" → [emoji] + [emoji] + [emoji] + t (lowercase) + [emoji] + [emoji] + iz (i and z) + e (🤑) + r (🤩). So \"iz🤑🤩\" is \"izer\" (i-z-e-r). So the word ends with \"izer\". Common words ending with izer: \"organizer\", \"realizer\", \"finalizer\", \"maximizer\", \"minimizer\", \"criticizer\", etc. Let's take \"organizer\" (o-r-g-a-n-i-z-e-r). Let's check:\n\norganizer → o (🤗) + r (🦊) + g (😴) + a (🐻) + n (🤖) + i (iz part) + z (iz part) + e (🤑) + r (🤩). Oh! That fits. Let's see:\n\n🤗 = o (since organizer starts with o)\n🦊 = r (second letter)\n😴 = g (third letter)\nt is lowercase t (so the next part is \"t🐻🤖\" → t + a (if 🐻=a) + n (if 🤖=n) → \"tan\" (t-a-n). Then \"iz🤑🤩\" is \"izer\" (i-z-e-r). So \"organizer\" would be:\n\n🤗 (o) + 🦊 (r) + 😴 (g) + t (t) + 🐻 (a) + 🤖 (n) + iz (i-z) + 🤑 (e) + 🤩 (r) → o r g t a n i z e r → \"orgtanizer\"? No, that's not right. Maybe \"t\" is part of the word. Let's think again. The structure is \"🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩\" → [emoji][emoji][emoji]t[emoji][emoji]izer. Let's take \"characterizer\" (c-h-a-r-a-c-t-e-r-i-z-e-r). No, too long. \"Authorizer\"? a-u-t-h-o-r-i-z-e-r. Let's check: a (🤗) + u (🦊) + t (😴) + t (t) + h (🐻) + o (🤖) + izer → \"auththorizer\"? No. Alternatively, \"synthesizer\" (s-y-n-t-h-e-s-i-z-e-r). s (🤗) + y (🦊) + n (😴) + t (t) + h (🐻) + e (🤖) + izer → \"synth...izer\". That's \"synthesizer\". Let's see:\n\ns (🤗) + y (🦊) + n (😴) + t (t) + h (🐻) + e (🤖) + izer (i-z-e-r). So \"synthesizer\" would be s y n t h e i z e r. Which would match:\n\n🤗=s, 🦊=y, 😴=n, 🐻=h, 🤖=e. Then \"🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩\" becomes s y n t h e iz e r → \"synthe izer\" → \"synthesizer\" (since \"iz\" is i-z, and \"e\" is from 🤑, \"r\" from 🤩). That works! Let's check this possibility.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n🤗=s\n🦊=y\n😴=n\n🐻=h\n🤖=e\n\nLet's check if these fit with other parts. Let's see part 2: \"🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑\" → [emoji] + y (🦊) + t (t) + h (🐻) + e (🤖) + h (🐻) + t i (t and i) + [emoji] (😎) + e (🤑). So that would be [X] y t h e h t i [Y] e. Let's see. Maybe \"sympathetic\"? s y m p a t h e t i c. But we have [X] y t h e h t i [Y] e. Let's break it down: [X]y the hti [Y]e. Maybe \"systemthe...\" No. Let's think of a word like \"synthetic\" (s y n t h e t i c). s (🤗) y (🦊) n (😴) t h e t i c. But in part 2, it's \"🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑\" → [X] y t h e h t i [Y] e. So [X] y t h e h t i [Y] e. Let's see: \"s y t h e h t i [Y] e\". Maybe \"synthetic\" → s y n t h e t i c. But \"n\" is 😴, which is in part 3. Maybe \"s\" is 🤗, \"y\" is 🦊, \"n\" is 😴, but part 2 has \"🤔\" which is another emoji.\n\nLet's check part 10: \"🤩🐻t🥴\" → r (🤩) + h (🐻) + t (t) + h (🥴) → \"rht h\"? No, \"r h t h\" → \"rht h\" which isn't a word. Maybe \"ruth\" (r-u-t-h). But if 🐻=u, then \"r u t h\" → \"ruth\". Let's think again.\n\nFrom the first attempt, 🐻 was guessed as a and was wrong. So 🐻 is not a. Let's look at part 9: \"🐸🤩🐻🤖\" → [emoji] + r (🤩) + [emoji] + [emoji]. If \"🤖\" is part of a word, maybe \"carry\" (c-a-r-r-y) but no. Let's look at the end: \"in 1967 🐸🐻🤩 🦊😴 $750.00.\" → \"in 1967 [emoji][emoji]r [emoji][emoji] $750.00.\" Maybe \"in 1967 Ford sold $750.00.\" But \"Ford\" would be F-o-r-d. So [emoji] (F) + [emoji] (o) + r (🤩) → \"For\". Then \"🦊😴\" could be \"d\" (Ford). But not sure.\n\nLet's look at part 4: \"d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺\" → d (lowercase) + [emoji] + r + r + [emoji] + [emoji]. Let's say this is \"dinner\" (d-i-n-n-e-r). Then:\n\nd (d) + 🤔 (i) + r (r) + r (r) + 🧧 (n) + 🥺 (e) → \"dinner\". That would make:\n\n🤔=i\n🧧=n\n🥺=e\n\nBut wait, 🤑=e is already correct. So if 🥺=e, that's a conflict because emojis must have unique letters. So that can't be. So \"dinner\" is out. Next, \"dresser\" (d-r-e-s-s-e-r). No, structure doesn't fit. \"Drama\" (d-r-a-m-a). No. \"Droopy\" (d-r-o-o-p-y). No. \"Drover\" (d-r-o-v-e-r). Let's check: d (d) + 🤔 (r) + r (r) + 🧧 (o) + 🥺 (v) + e (r)? No, \"d r r o v e r\" → \"drrover\" not a word.\n\nLet's look at part 5: \"😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d\" → [emoji] + t (t) + [emoji] + r (🤩) + [emoji] + i (i) + r (🤩) + d (d). So \"t\" + [emoji] + r + [emoji] + i + r + d. Maybe \"what is it\" but no. Let's think of \"with r... ird\". \"With\" → w-i-t-h. But \"😴t\" could be \"wt\" (w and t). If 😴=w, then \"wt\" → \"wt\" (as in weight). Let's try 😴=w. Then \"😴t\" is \"wt\". Then \"😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d\" → \"wt🤔r🙄ir d\". Maybe \"wtf... ird\"? Not helpful.\n\nAnother angle: the first attempt had 🐸=c (wrong), so 🐸 isn't c. Let's look at part 1: \"🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈\" → [emoji] + e (🤑) + [emoji] + [emoji] + [emoji] + [emoji]. Maybe \"Steve\" (S-t-e-v-e). But \"Steve\" is 5 letters, but here it's 6 emojis. \"Stevens\" → S-t-e-v-e-n-s. No, 7 letters. \"Shelly\" → S-h-e-l-l-y. 6 letters: S (🐸) + h (🐻) + e (🤑) + l (🥺) + l (🥺) + y (😈). That would fit! So \"Shelly\" → 🐸=S, 🐻=h, 🥺=l, 😈=y. Let's check:\n\nIf part 1 is \"Shelly\" (6 letters):\n\n🐸=S\n🤑=e (correct)\n🥺=l (so two 🥺 would be ll)\n🐻=h\n😈=y\n\nThen \"🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈\" → S e l l h y → \"Shelly\". That's a possible name. Let's verify with other parts.\n\nIf 🐻=h (from \"Shelly\"), then part 10: \"🤩🐻t🥴\" → r (🤩) + h (🐻) + t (t) + h (🥴) → \"rht h\" → \"rht h\" which doesn't make sense. But maybe \"ruth\" (r-u-t-h). If 🐻=u, then \"ruth\" → r u t h. So maybe \"Shelly\" isn't right. Alternatively, \"Jenny\": J-e-n-n-y. So:\n\n🐸=J\n🤑=e (correct)\n🥺=n (two 🥺=nn)\n🐻=n? No, that would repeat. \"Jenny\" is J e n n y → 5 letters, but part 1 has 6 emojis. \"Jessica\": J-e-s-s-i-c-a. No. \"Denise\": D-e-n-i-s-e. 6 letters: D (🐸) + e (🤑) + n (🥺) + i (🥺) + s (🐻) + e (😈). No, 6 letters. \"Denise\" is 6 letters, but that would be D e n i s e. So \"🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈\" → D e n i s e → \"Denise\". Then:\n\n🐸=D\n🤑=e (correct)\n🥺=n, i? No, emojis must be unique. So two 🥺 would be the same letter. So \"Denise\" would have two n's? No, \"Denise\" is D-e-n-i-s-e. No repeats. \"Ellen\": E-l-l-e-n. 5 letters. \"Allison\": A-l-l-i-s-o-n. 7 letters. \n\nLet's go back to the first attempt feedback: 🐻=a was wrong. So 🐻≠a. Let's look at part 2: \"🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑\" → [emoji] + [emoji] + t + [emoji] + [emoji] + [emoji] + t i + [emoji] + e. Let's say this is \"sympathetic\" (s-y-m-p-a-t-h-e-t-i-c). But not sure. Alternatively, \"systemthe...\" Not helpful.\n\nAnother part: \"😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑\" → [emoji] + e (🤑) + h (🥴) + i (i) + [emoji] + [emoji] + e (🤑). So \"e h i [emoji][emoji] e\". Maybe \"sheikhe\" (s-h-e-i-k-h-e). But \"😎\" would be s, so \"s e h i k h e\" → \"sheikhe\". That could work. So:\n\n😎=s\n🤗=k\n🥺=h\nBut 🥴=h is already correct, so 🥺 can't be h. Conflict. So no.\n\nLet's think about the $750.00 part. It's likely a price, so the sentence might be about a purchase or a salary. \"in 1967 [X] [Y]r [Z] [W] $750.00.\" Maybe \"in 1967 Ford sold for $750.00.\" So \"Ford\" would be F-o-r-d. So \"🐸🐻🤩\" is F-o-r (since 🤩=r). So 🐸=F, 🐻=o, 🤩=r (correct). Then \"🐸🐻🤩\" → F-o-r → \"For\". That could fit. Then \"🦊😴\" could be \"d\" (Ford), so \"🦊😴\"=d. But \"d\" is a lowercase letter in other parts. Maybe \"🦊=d\", \"😴= something else.\n\nIf 🐸=F, then part 1: \"🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈\" → F-e-[emoji][emoji]-o-[emoji]. Maybe \"Fellow\" (F-e-l-l-o-w). So:\n\n🐸=F\n🤑=e (correct)\n🥺=l (two 🥺=ll)\n🐻=o\n😈=w\n\nThen \"Fellow\" → F e l l o w. That's 6 letters, matching the 6 emojis. That works! Let's check:\n\nPart 1: 🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈 → F e l l o w → \"Fellow\". That's a possible word.\n\nIf 🐻=o (from \"Fellow\"), then let's check part 10: \"🤩🐻t🥴\" → r (🤩) + o (🐻) + t (t) + h (🥴) → \"roth\" → \"Roth\" (a name). That's possible.\n\nNow, part 9: \"🐸🤩🐻🤖\" → F (🐸) + r (🤩) + o (🐻) + [emoji] → \"For[X]\". Maybe \"Form\" (F-o-r-m). So 🤖=m. Let's check.\n\nIf 🤖=m, then part 2: \"🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑\" → [emoji] + [emoji] + t (t) + o (🐻) + m (🤖) + o (🐻) + t i (t and i) + [emoji] (😎) + e (🤑). So \"[X][Y]tomoti[Z]e\". Maybe \"Automotive\" (A-u-t-o-m-o-t-i-v-e). Let's see:\n\nA (🤔) + u (🦊) + t (t) + o (🐻) + m (🤖) + o (🐻) + t (t) + i (i) + v (😎) + e (🤑) → \"Automotive\". That's a perfect fit! Let's check:\n\n🤔=A (Automotive starts with A)\n🦊=u (second letter u)\nt is lowercase t\n🐻=o (third letter o)\n🤖=m (fourth letter m)\n🐻=o (fifth letter o)\nti is t and i (sixth and seventh letters t and i)\n😎=v (eighth letter v)\n🤑=e (ninth letter e)\n\nYes! \"Automotive\" is 10 letters: A-u-t-o-m-o-t-i-v-e. So the part \"🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑\" would be A u t o m o t i v e → \"Automotive\". That's brilliant! Let's verify each emoji here:\n\n🤔=A\n🦊=u\n🐻=o (since part 2 has \"t🐻🤖🐻\" → t o m o → \"tom o\" which is part of \"Automotive\": t-o-m-o-t-i-v-e)\n🤖=m\n😎=v\n\nLet's check if these fit with other parts.\n\nPart 3: \"🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩\" → [emoji] + u (🦊) + [emoji] + t (t) + o (🐻) + m (🤖) + iz (i and z) + e (🤑) + r (🤩). So \"u t o m izer\" → \"utomizer\". Wait, \"atomizer\" (a-t-o-m-i-z-e-r). Let's see:\n\natomizer → a (🤗) + t (t) + o (🐻) + m (🤖) + i (i) + z (z) + e (🤑) + r (🤩). But the part is \"🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩\" → [emoji] + u (🦊) + [emoji] + t + o + m + iz + e + r. If \"atomizer\" is the word, then the structure would need 🦊 to be t, but we have 🦊=u. Alternatively, \"organizer\" (o-r-g-a-n-i-z-e-r). But earlier we thought 🦊=u. Let's think again.\n\nPart 3: \"🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩\" → [X] u [Y] t o m izer. Maybe \"humidizer\" (h-u-m-i-d-i-f-i-e-r). No, structure doesn't fit. \"Humidifier\" (h-u-m-i-d-i-f-i-e-r). No. \"Humanizer\" (h-u-m-a-n-i-z-e-r). Let's check:\n\nh (🤗) + u (🦊) + m (😴) + t (t) + a (🐻) + n (🤖) + iz (i-z) + e (🤑) + r (🤩) → \"humanizer\". But we have 🐻=o, so that's not a. Alternatively, \"humorizer\" (h-u-m-o-r-i-z-e-r). h (🤗) + u (🦊) + m (😴) + o (🐻) + r (🤩) + i-z-e-r. But the part has \"t🐻🤖\", which would be t o m. So \"humorizer\" would need \"t o m\" in there, which it doesn't.\n\nLet's move to part 6: \"🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d\" → [emoji] + u (🦊) + r (🤩) + [emoji] + h (🥴) + A (🤔) + [emoji] + e (🤑) + d (d). So \"u r [X] h A [Y] e d\". Maybe \"Authorized\" (a-u-t-h-o-r-i-z-e-d). Let's see:\n\na (🐭) + u (🦊) + t (😴) + h (🥴) + o (🐻) + r (🤩) + i (🤗) + z (🤑) + e (😴?) No, this is getting confusing. Let's check part 5: \"😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d\" → [emoji] + t (t) + A (🤔) + r (🤩) + [emoji] + i (i) + r (🤩) + d (d). So \"t A r [X] i r d\". Maybe \"tAr... ird\". \"tAr\" could be \"tarp\" (t-a-r-p). But \"t A r p i r d\" → \"tarp ird\". Not helpful.\n\nLet's summarize the possible emojis we have so far based on the \"Fellow\" and \"Automotive\" assumptions:\n\nFrom part 1: \"Fellow\" → 🐸=F, 🤑=e (correct), 🥺=l, 🐻=o, 😈=w.\n\nFrom part 2: \"Automotive\" → 🤔=A, 🦊=u, 🐻=o (correct), 🤖=m, 😎=v, 🤑=e (correct).\n\nCheck if these are unique: F, e, l, o, w, A, u, m, v. All unique so far.\n\nLet's check part 10: \"🤩🐻t🥴\" → r (🤩) + o (🐻) + t (t) + h (🥴) → \"roth\" → \"Roth\". That's a valid name.\n\nPart 12: \"in 1967 🐸🐻🤩\" → in 1967 F (🐸) o (🐻) r (🤩) → \"in 1967 For\". Maybe \"in 1967 Ford\" (F-o-r-d), but \"d\" is a lowercase letter. So \"For\" could be part of \"Ford\".\n\nPart 13: \"🦊😴\" → u (🦊) + [emoji] (😴). Maybe \"u\" + \"s\" → \"us\". So 😴=s. Then \"🦊😴\"=u s → \"us\".\n\nLet's check part 3 again with 😴=s: \"🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩\" → [emoji] + u (🦊) + s (😴) + t (t) + o (🐻) + m (🤖) + iz (i-z) + e (🤑) + r (🤩). So \"u s t o m izer\" → \"ustomizer\". \"Customizer\" (c-u-s-t-o-m-i-z-e-r). Oh! That fits. So:\n\n🤗=c (since \"Customizer\" starts with c)\nThen \"🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩\" → c (🤗) + u (🦊) + s (😴) + t (t) + o (🐻) + m (🤖) + iz (i-z) + e (🤑) + r (🤩) → \"customizer\". Perfect! That's a valid word. So:\n\n🤗=c\n🦊=u\n😴=s\n🐻=o\n🤖=m\n🤑=e (correct)\n🤩=r (correct)\n\nLet's check if these fit with other parts.\n\nPart 3: \"🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩\" → c u s t o m i z e r → \"customizer\". Correct!\n\nNow, part 6: \"🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d\" → [emoji] + u (🦊) + r (🤩) + c (🤗) + h (🥴) + A (🤔) + s (😴) + e (🤑) + d (d). So \"u r c h A s e d\". Let's see: \"urchased\" → \"urchased\" (maybe \"purchased\"). \"Purchased\" (p-u-r-c-h-a-s-e-d). Oh! That's it. So:\n\n🐭=p (since \"purchased\" starts with p)\nThen \"🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d\" → p (🐭) + u (🦊) + r (🤩) + c (🤗) + h (🥴) + a (🤔) + s (😴) + e (🤑) + d (d) → \"purchased\". Perfect! So:\n\n🐭=p\n🤔=a (since \"purchased\" has 'a' as the 6th letter: p-u-r-c-h-a-s-e-d)\n\nLet's verify part 2 again with 🤔=a: \"🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑\" → a (🤔) + u (🦊) + t (t) + o (🐻) + m (🤖) + o (🐻) + t (t) + i (i) + v (😎) + e (🤑) → \"automot ive\" → \"automotive\". Yes! \"Automotive\" (a-u-t-o-m-o-t-i-v-e). That's correct. So:\n\n😎=v (since the 9th letter is v)\n\nNow, part 5: \"😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d\" → s (😴) + t (t) + a (🤔) + r (🤩) + [emoji] + i (i) + r (🤩) + d (d). So \"star[X] ird\". Let's think of \"starbird\" but that's too long. Maybe \"staring\" → s-t-a-r-i-n-g. But \"staring\" is 7 letters. The part is \"s t a r [X] i r d\" → 8 characters. Maybe \"starkird\"? Not a word. Alternatively, \"startird\" → no. Let's check the structure: \"😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d\" is s t a r [emoji] i r d. Let's say \"🙄=k\", then \"stark ird\" → \"starkird\". Not helpful. Maybe it's a typo or a less common word. Let's move on.\n\nPart 4: \"d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺\" → d (d) + a (🤔) + r (🤩) + r (🤩) + [emoji] + [emoji]. So \"d a r r [X][Y]\". \"darry\" → d-a-r-r-y. So if 🧧=y and 🥺=y, but emojis must be unique. So no. \"darryl\" → d-a-r-r-y-l. So \"d a r r y l\" → \"darryl\". So:\n\n🧧=y\n🥺=l\n\nThen \"d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺\" → d a r r y l → \"darryl\". That's a name. So:\n\n🧧=y\n🥺=l\n\nLet's check part 1: \"🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈\" → [emoji] + e (🤑) + l (🥺) + l (🥺) + o (🐻) + [emoji]. So \"e l l o [X]\". \"Hello\" (h-e-l-l-o). But \"🐸\" would be h. So:\n\n🐸=h\nThen \"🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈\" → h e l l o [X] → \"hello[X]\". Maybe \"helloW\" (h-e-l-l-o-w) → \"hellow\". So 😈=w.\n\nSo \"🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈\" → h e l l o w → \"hellow\". That's a possible word (though \"hello\" is more common, but maybe \"hellow\" as a variant).\n\nLet's summarize all the emojis we've deduced so far:\n\n- 🤩=r (given)\n- 🤑=e (correct from history)\n- 🥴=h (correct from history)\n- 🐻=o (from part 2 and 1)\n- 🐸=h (from part 1)\n- 🤖=m (from part 2)\n- 🤔=a (from part 2 and 6)\n- 🦊=u (from part 2 and 3)\n- 😴=s (from part 3)\n- 🤗=c (from part 3)\n- 😎=v (from part 2)\n- 🐭=p (from part 6)\n- 🧧=y (from part 4)\n- 🥺=l (from part 1 and 4)\n- 😈=w (from part 1)\n- 🙄=? (unknown, but maybe not needed for this guess)\n\nLet's check if these are all unique. The letters assigned are: r, e, h, o, h (wait, 🐸=h and 🥴=h? Oh no! 🥴=h is correct from history. So if 🐸=h, that's a conflict. Because each emoji must have a unique letter. Oh, that's a mistake. So 🥴=h (correct), so 🐸 can't be h. Let's backtrack.\n\nFrom part 6: \"🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d\" → p (🐭) + u (🦊) + r (🤩) + c (🤗) + h (🥴) + a (🤔) + s (😴) + e (🤑) + d (d) → \"purchased\". That's correct, and 🥴=h is correct, so that's okay.\n\nIn part 1, \"🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈\" → [X] e l l o [Y]. Let's think of \"mellow\" (m-e-l-l-o-w). So:\n\n🐸=m\n🥺=l\n🐻=o\n😈=w\n\nThen \"mellow\" → m e l l o w. That's 6 letters. So:\n\n🐸=m\n🤑=e (correct)\n🥺=l\n🐻=o\n😈=w\n\nNo conflict with 🥴=h. Good.\n\nNow, part 9: \"🐸🤩🐻🤖\" → m (🐸) + r (🤩) + o (🐻) + [emoji] → \"mor[X]\". Maybe \"morn\" (m-o-r-n). So 🤖=n. Let's check.\n\nIf 🤖=n, then part 2: \"🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑\" → [emoji] + u (🦊) + t (t) + o (🐻) + n (🤖) + o (🐻) + t i (t and i) + [emoji] (😎) + e (🤑). So \"[X]u t o n o t i [Y]e\". Let's think of \"automotive\" again. \"Automotive\" is a-u-t-o-m-o-t-i-v-e. But if 🤖=n, then \"t🐻🤖🐻\" is t o n o → \"ton o\". Not matching \"tom o\" in \"automotive\". So maybe \"autonomic\" (a-u-t-o-n-o-m-i-c). \"autonomic\" → a-u-t-o-n-o-m-i-c. So part 2: \"🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑\" → a (🤔) + u (🦊) + t (t) + o (🐻) + n (🤖) + o (🐻) + t (t) + i (i) + c (😎) + e (🤑) → \"autonomic e\". No, \"autonomic\" is 9 letters, and \"autonomic e\" doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, \"autonomous\" (a-u-t-o-n-o-m-o-u-s). No, too long.\n\nLet's go back to part 2 with the correct \"automotive\" structure. If \"automotive\" is a-u-t-o-m-o-t-i-v-e, then:\n\n🤔=a\n🦊=u\nt is t\n🐻=o\n🤖=m\n🐻=o (again)\nti is t and i\n😎=v\n🤑=e\n\nSo \"automotive\" fits perfectly. Then 🤖=m (so no conflict with other letters). Let's confirm:\n\n- 🤖=m (no conflict with h, e, r, etc.)\n- 🐻=o (unique)\n- 🤔=a (unique)\n- 🦊=u (unique)\n- 😎=v (unique)\n- 🤑=e (correct)\n- 🤩=r (correct)\n- 🥴=h (correct)\n- 🐸=m (from part 1 \"mellow\") → but \"m\" is already 🤖=m. Oh, conflict! So 🐸 can't be m. \n\nLet's try \"jellow\" (j-e-l-l-o-w). So:\n\n🐸=j\n🤑=e (correct)\n🥺=l\n🐻=o\n😈=w\n\nNo conflicts. Then part 9: \"🐸🤩🐻🤖\" → j (🐸) + r (🤩) + o (🐻) + [emoji] → \"jor[X]\". Maybe \"jorum\" (j-o-r-u-m). So 🤖=u. But 🦊=u, conflict. No.\n\nAlternatively, \"yellow\" (y-e-l-l-o-w). So:\n\n🐸=y\n🤑=e (correct)\n🥺=l\n🐻=o\n😈=w\n\nThen part 9: \"🐸🤩🐻🤖\" → y (🐸) + r (🤩) + o (🐻) + [emoji] → \"yor[X]\". Maybe \"yoru\" (Japanese for \"night\"), but not English.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's list all the correct emojis from history and the hint:\n\nCorrect emojis to include: 🤩=r, 🤑=e, 🥴=h.\n\nOther emojis we need to guess: 🐸, 🥺, 🐻, 😈, 🤔, 🦊, 😴, 🤗, 🤖, 😎, 🐭, 🧧, 🙄.\n\nLet's look for other patterns. The word \"in 1967 🐸🐻🤩 🦊😴 $750.00.\" likely has a 3-letter word for \"🐸🐻🤩\" (since it's three emojis) and a 2-letter word for \"🦊😴\".\n\nThree-letter words ending with r (since 🤩=r): for, bar, car, far, her, per, sir, etc.\n\nTwo-letter words: of, to, in, on, up, us, as, at, he, she, it, me, we, by, my, etc.\n\nIf \"🐸🐻🤩\" is \"for\" (f-o-r), then:\n\n🐸=f\n🐻=o\n🤩=r (correct)\n\nThen \"🦊😴\" could be \"us\" (u-s), so:\n\n🦊=u\n😴=s\n\nThat fits. Let's check:\n\n\"in 1967 for us $750.00.\" → \"in 1967 for us $750.00.\" That makes sense.\n\nNow, part 10: \"🤩🐻t🥴\" → r (🤩) + o (🐻) + t (t) + h (🥴) → \"roth\" (a name).\n\nPart 3: \"🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩\" → [emoji] + u (🦊) + s (😴) + t (t) + o (🐻) + [emoji] + iz (i-z) + e (🤑) + r (🤩). So \"u s t o [X] izer\" → \"ustomizer\". \"Customizer\" (c-u-s-t-o-m-i-z-e-r). So:\n\n🤗=c\n🤖=m\n\nThen \"customizer\" → c-u-s-t-o-m-i-z-e-r. Perfect! So:\n\n🤗=c\n🤖=m\n\nPart 2: \"🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑\" → [emoji] + u (🦊) + t (t) + o (🐻) + m (🤖) + o (🐻) + t i (t and i) + [emoji] (😎) + e (🤑). So \"[X]u t o m o t i [Y]e\". \"Automotive\" (a-u-t-o-m-o-t-i-v-e). So:\n\n🤔=a\n😎=v\n\nYes! \"automotive\" → a-u-t-o-m-o-t-i-v-e. That fits.\n\nPart 6: \"🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d\" → [emoji] + u (🦊) + r (🤩) + c (🤗) + h (🥴) + a (🤔) + s (😴) + e (🤑) + d (d). So \"u r c h a s e d\" → \"purchased\" (p-u-r-c-h-a-s-e-d). So:\n\n🐭=p\n\nPart 4: \"d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺\" → d (d) + a (🤔) + r (🤩) + r (🤩) + [emoji] + [emoji]. \"darryl\" (d-a-r-r-y-l). So:\n\n🧧=y\n🥺=l\n\nPart 1: \"🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈\" → f (🐸) + e (🤑) + l (🥺) + l (🥺) + o (🐻) + [emoji]. \"fellow\" (f-e-l-l-o-w). So:\n\n😈=w\n\nNow, let's list all the emojis with their letters:\n\n- 🤩=r (correct)\n- 🤑=e (correct)\n- 🥴=h (correct)\n- 🐸=f\n- 🥺=l\n- 🐻=o\n- 😈=w\n- 🤔=a\n- 🦊=u\n- 😴=s\n- 🤗=c\n- 🤖=m\n- 😎=v\n- 🐭=p\n- 🧧=y\n- 🙄=? (unknown, but not needed for this guess)\n\nLet's verify all parts with these assignments:\n\n1. 🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈 → f e l l o w → \"fellow\" ✔️\n2. 🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑 → a u t o m o t i v e → \"automotive\" ✔️\n3. 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩 → c u s t o m i z e r → \"customizer\" ✔️\n4. d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺 → d a r r y l → \"darryl\" ✔️\n5. 😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d → s t a r [🙄] i r d → \"starr[🙄]ird\" (unknown 🙄, but others fit)\n6. 🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d → p u r c h a s e d → \"purchased\" ✔️\n7. t🥴🤑 → t h e → \"the\" ✔️\n8. 😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑 → v e h i c l e → \"vehicle\" ✔️ (v-e-h-i-c-l-e)\n9. 🐸🤩🐻🤖 → f r o m → \"from\" ✔️ (f-r-o-m)\n10. 🤩🐻t🥴 → r o t h → \"roth\" ✔️\n11. in 1967 → \"in 1967\" ✔️\n12. 🐸🐻🤩 → f o r → \"for\" ✔️\n13. 🦊😴 → u s → \"us\" ✔️\n14. $750.00 → \"$750.00\" ✔️\n\nWow, all parts fit! Let's confirm each:\n\n- Part 8: \"😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑\" → v (😎) + e (🤑) + h (🥴) + i (i) + c (🤗) + l (🥺) + e (🤑) → \"vehicle\" ✔️\n- Part 9: \"🐸🤩🐻🤖\" → f (🐸) + r (🤩) + o (🐻) + m (🤖) → \"from\" ✔️\n- Part 12: \"🐸🐻🤩\" → f (🐸) + o (🐻) + r (🤩) → \"for\" ✔️\n- Part 13: \"🦊😴\" → u (🦊) + s (😴) → \"us\" ✔️\n\nEverything checks out. So the emojis and their letters are:\n\n🤩=r, 🤑=e, 🥴=h, 🐸=f, 🥺=l, 🐻=o, 😈=w, 🤔=a, 🦊=u, 😴=s, 🤗=c, 🤖=m, 😎=v, 🐭=p, 🧧=y.\n\nTo solve the Crypto Word Game, we analyze the encoded sentence, known hints, and feedback from previous attempts. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Key Information:\n- **Hint**: 🤩=r (correct).\n- **History Feedback**: 🤑=e (correct), 🥴=h (correct), while 🐻, 🐸, 🤖 were incorrect.\n- **Encoded Sentence Structure**: Includes lowercase letters (t, i, z, d, etc.) and emojis replacing uppercase letters.\n\n### Deductions:\n1. **t🥴🤑**: Lowercase \"t\" + 🥴=h + 🤑=e → \"the\" (common word, confirms 🥴=h and 🤑=e).\n2. **in 1967 🐸🐻🤩 🦊😴 $750.00**: Likely \"in 1967 for us $750.00\" (common phrasing). Thus:\n   - 🐸🐻🤩 → \"for\" (3-letter word ending with r). So 🐸=f, 🐻=o, 🤩=r (matches hint).\n   - 🦊😴 → \"us\" (2-letter word). So 🦊=u, 😴=s.\n3. **🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩**: \"customizer\" (c-u-s-t-o-m-i-z-e-r). Thus:\n   - 🤗=c, 🤖=m (fills \"c-u-s-t-o-m-i-z-e-r\").\n4. **🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑**: \"automotive\" (a-u-t-o-m-o-t-i-v-e). Thus:\n   - 🤔=a, 😎=v (fills \"a-u-t-o-m-o-t-i-v-e\").\n5. **🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d**: \"purchased\" (p-u-r-c-h-a-s-e-d). Thus:\n   - 🐭=p (fills \"p-u-r-c-h-a-s-e-d\").\n6. **d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺**: \"darryl\" (d-a-r-r-y-l). Thus:\n   - 🧧=y, 🥺=l (fills \"d-a-r-r-y-l\").\n7. **🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈**: \"fellow\" (f-e-l-l-o-w). Thus:\n   - 😈=w (fills \"f-e-l-l-o-w\").\n8. **😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑**: \"vehicle\" (v-e-h-i-c-l-e). Confirms 😎=v, 🤑=e, 🥴=h, 🤗=c, 🥺=l.\n9. **🐸🤩🐻🤖**: \"from\" (f-r-o-m). Confirms 🐸=f, 🤩=r, 🐻=o, 🤖=m.\n10. **🤩🐻t🥴**: \"roth\" (r-o-t-h). Confirms 🤩=r, 🐻=o, t (lowercase), 🥴=h.\n\n### Final Guesses:\nAll emojis are mapped to unique letters, incorporating the hint and correct history entries.\n\nAnswer: 🤩=r, 🤑=e, 🥴=h, 🐸=f, 🥺=l, 🐻=o, 😈=w, 🤔=a, 🦊=u, 😴=s, 🤗=c, 🤖=m, 😎=v, 🐭=p, 🧧=y","Okay, let's try to figure out the encoded sentence. First, let's list out all the emojis and their confirmed meanings from the history. \n\nFrom Attempt 1 feedback: 🤩=r (correct), 🤑=e (correct), 🥴=h (correct). The others in that guess were wrong. \n\nAttempt 2 guess had a lot, and the feedback says most were correct. Let's check the Feedback for Attempt 2: \n\n- 🤩: True (already known)\n- 🤑: True (already known)\n- 🥴: True (already known)\n- 🐸: True → so 🐸 is correct, let's note that.\n- 🥺: True → 🥺 is correct.\n- 🐻: True → 🐻 is correct.\n- 😈: True → 😈 is correct.\n- 🤔: True → 🤔 is correct.\n- 🦊: True → 🦊 is correct.\n- 😴: True → 😴 is correct.\n- 🤗: True → 🤗 is correct.\n- 🤖: True → 🤖 is correct.\n- 😎: True → 😎 is correct.\n- 🐭: True → 🐭 is correct.\n- 🧧: False → not part of the sentence, maybe a typo?\n\nSo from Attempt 2, we have these confirmed:\n\n🤩=r, 🤑=e, 🥴=h, 🐸=f, 🥺=l, 🐻=o, 😈=w, 🤔=a, 🦊=u, 😴=s, 🤗=c, 🤖=m, 😎=v, 🐭=p.\n\nLet me verify that. Let's substitute these into the encoded sentence and see if it makes sense.\n\nEncoded Sentence:\n\nLet's break it down word by word. Let's replace each emoji with their confirmed letters.\n\nOriginal sentence parts:\n\n1. 🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈 → f e l l o w (fellow)\n   Let's check: 🐸=f, 🤑=e, 🥺=l, 🥺=l, 🐻=o, 😈=w → \"fellow\" → that makes sense. Good start.\n\n2. 🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑 → a u t o m o t i v e (automotive)\n   Let's substitute: 🤔=a, 🦊=u, t (literal t), 🐻=o, 🤖=m, 🐻=o, t (literal t), i (literal i), 😎=v, 🤑=e → \"automot ive\"? Wait, \"auto\" (a u t o), then m (🤖=m), o (🐻=o), t (t), i (i), v (😎=v), e (🤑=e) → \"automotive\" → yes! That's correct. So \"automotive\".\n\n3. 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩 → c u s t o m i z e r (customizer)\n   Substitute: 🤗=c, 🦊=u, 😴=s, t (t), 🐻=o, 🤖=m, i (i), z (z), 🤑=e, 🤩=r → \"cust omizer\"? Wait, \"c u s t o m i z e r\" → \"customizer\". Perfect.\n\n4. d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺 → d a r r ? l (darr?l). Hmm, but the emoji 🧧 was in Attempt 2's guess as 'y' but feedback said False. The encoded sentence has 🧧 here. Wait, the original encoded sentence has \"d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺\". Let's check: d (literal d), 🤔=a, 🤩=r, 🤩=r, 🧧 (unknown), 🥺=l. So \"dar?l\". Maybe \"darryl\"? But the fifth character is 🧧. If 🧧 was guessed as 'y' and wrong, maybe it's another letter. But let's check other parts first.\n\n5. 😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d → s t a r ? i r d (star?ird). The emoji 🙄 is new here. Let's note that.\n\n6. 🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d → p u r c h a s e d (purchased)\n   Substitute: 🐭=p, 🦊=u, 🤩=r, 🤗=c, 🥴=h, 🤔=a, 😴=s, 🤑=e, d (d) → \"purchased\" → exactly! That's correct.\n\n7. t🥴🤑 → t h e (the). t (t), 🥴=h, 🤑=e → \"the\". Correct.\n\n8. 😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑 → v e h i c l e (vehicle)\n   Substitute: 😎=v, 🤑=e, 🥴=h, i (i), 🤗=c, 🥺=l, 🤑=e → \"vehicle\". Perfect!\n\n9. 🐸🤩🐻🤖 → f r o m (from). 🐸=f, 🤩=r, 🐻=o, 🤖=m → \"from\". Correct.\n\n10. 🤩🐻t🥴 → r o t h (roth). 🤩=r, 🐻=o, t (t), 🥴=h → \"roth\". Maybe a name.\n\n11. in 1967 🐸🐻🤩 → in 1967 f o r (in 1967 for). 🐸=f, 🐻=o, 🤩=r → \"for\". Correct.\n\n12. 🦊😴 $750.00. → u s $750.00. (us $750.00). 🦊=u, 😴=s → \"us $750.00\". That makes sense.\n\nNow, let's look at the parts with unknown emojis. The unknown emojis in the encoded sentence are 🧧 and 🙄. Let's check where they appear.\n\nFirst unknown part: \"d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺\" → d a r r [🧧] l. Let's see. The word here is probably a name, maybe \"Darryl\". If \"Darryl\", then the missing letter is 'y'. In Attempt 2, the guess for 🧧 was 'y' but feedback said False. Oh, that's a problem. Wait, the feedback for Attempt 2 says {'🧧': False}, so 🧧 is not 'y'. Then maybe another letter. Let's see. Let's think of possible 5-letter words starting with 'dar' and ending with 'l'. \"Darryl\" is 6 letters (D-A-R-R-Y-L), which matches the length here (d a r r [🧧] l → 6 letters). So the fifth character is the 5th letter. So \"d a r r [x] l\". Maybe \"Darryl\" is correct, but if 🧧 was guessed as 'y' and wrong, perhaps it's a typo, or maybe another letter. Alternatively, maybe it's \"Darryl\" and the emoji is 'y' but the feedback was wrong? Unlikely. Let's check other parts.\n\nThe next unknown is \"😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d\" → s t a r [🙄] i r d. Let's see. The word here: \"star...ird\". Let's count the letters. \"s t a r [x] i r d\" → 8 letters. Possible words: \"starbird\"? Not sure. Maybe \"starboard\"? But that's 9 letters. \"Starfish\"? No, that's 8 letters but ends with 'h'. Alternatively, \"stardust\"? No. Let's see. The structure is s-t-a-r-[x]-i-r-d. Let's think. \"Stairbird\"? No. Maybe \"starlit\"? No, length. Alternatively, \"starlard\"? Not a word. Alternatively, \"starmird\"? No. Maybe it's a typo, but perhaps the unknown emoji 🙄 is 'b'? Let's see. \"starbird\"? Maybe, but not sure. Alternatively, \"starrird\" (if x is 'r') but that's repetitive. Alternatively, maybe \"starlord\"? No, that's 8 letters (s-t-a-r-l-o-r-d). Wait, \"starlord\" would be s t a r l o r d → 8 letters. So [🙄] would be 'l'? Let's check: \"s t a r l i r d\"? No. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let's check the entire sentence structure. Let's try to reconstruct the full sentence with the known parts.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n1. 🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈 → fellow\n2. 🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑 → automotive\n3. 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩 → customizer\n4. d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺 → d a r r [x] l (maybe Darryl)\n5. 😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d → s t a r [y] i r d (maybe a name or a term)\n6. 🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d → purchased\n7. t🥴🤑 → the\n8. 😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑 → vehicle\n9. 🐸🤩🐻🤖 → from\n10. 🤩🐻t🥴 → roth\n11. in 1967 🐸🐻🤩 → in 1967 for\n12. 🦊😴 $750.00. → us $750.00.\n\nPutting it all into a sentence:\n\n\"Fellow automotive customizer Darryl [something] purchased the vehicle from Roth in 1967 for us $750.00.\"\n\nThat makes sense. The part \"darryl [something] purchased\" would need a middle name or a descriptor. Let's check the fourth word: \"d a r r [x] l\" → \"Darryl\" (if x is 'y'), but in Attempt 2, the guess was 🧧=y and feedback said False. So maybe the emoji 🧧 is not 'y'. Let's think of other possibilities. Maybe \"Darryl\" is correct, but the emoji 🧧 is 'y' and the feedback was a mistake? Or perhaps it's another name. Let's see, \"Darryl\" is 6 letters (D-A-R-R-Y-L). The structure here is 6 letters (d, a, r, r, [x], l). So the fifth character is x. If x is 'y', then it's \"Darryl\". But the feedback says 🧧=y is False. Then perhaps the name is \"Darryl\" but the emoji is different. Alternatively, maybe \"Darryl\" is correct, and the feedback was wrong (unlikely). Let's move to the other unknown emoji 🙄.\n\nThe fifth part: \"s t a r [y] i r d\". Let's think of possible words. Let's say the word is \"starlitrd\" but that's not a word. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, or a name. Let's see the context: \"Darryl [something] purchased the vehicle...\" Maybe \"Darryl Stardust\" or similar. But \"stardust\" is 8 letters (s-t-a-r-d-u-s-t). The structure here is s-t-a-r-[y]-i-r-d → 8 letters. So \"s t a r [y] i r d\". Let's think: \"starrird\" (if y is 'r'), but that's not a word. \"Starbird\" (s-t-a-r-b-i-r-d) → 8 letters. Oh! \"Starbird\" would be s-t-a-r-b-i-r-d. So if the emoji 🙄=b, then that part becomes \"st a r b i r d\" → \"starbird\". That's a possible name. Let's check: \"Darryl Starbird purchased the vehicle from Roth in 1967 for us $750.00.\" That makes sense. Starbird could be a last name.\n\nSo, if 🙄=b, then \"starbird\" fits. Let's check if that works. The fifth part would be \"s t a r b i r d\" → \"starbird\".\n\nPutting that together: \"Fellow automotive customizer Darryl Starbird purchased the vehicle from Roth in 1967 for us $750.00.\" That makes perfect sense. \n\nNow, let's confirm the remaining emojis. The unknown emojis are 🧧 and 🙄. Let's check where they are in the encoded sentence.\n\nLooking back, the encoded sentence has:\n\n- d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺 → d a r r [🧧] l → \"Darryl\" if 🧧=y. But Attempt 2 guessed 🧧=y and feedback was False, so maybe that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps \"Darryl\" is correct, but the emoji is 🧧=y and the feedback was wrong. But according to the problem statement, the feedback is accurate. So perhaps the name is different. Let's think of other 6-letter names starting with \"Darr\" and ending with \"l\". \"Darryl\" is the main one. Maybe \"Darryl\" is correct, and the emoji 🧧 is 'y' but the feedback was a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the emoji is 🧧=y and the feedback was correct, but the name is not Darryl. Let's see. Maybe \"Darryl\" is correct, and the feedback was a mistake. Let's proceed with that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fourth word is \"Darryl\" (with 🧧=y), even though the feedback said False. But according to the problem statement, the feedback is accurate, so the user's guess for 🧧=y was wrong. So perhaps the emoji 🧧 is a different letter. Let's think. Let's say the name is \"Darryl\" (D-A-R-R-Y-L), so the fifth character is 'y', so 🧧=y. But the feedback for Attempt 2 says 🧧=y is False, which means that emoji is not 'y'. Then, maybe the name is \"Darryl\" but the emoji is not 🧧. Let's check the encoded sentence again. The fourth word is \"d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺\". The emojis here are 🤔=a, 🤩=r, 🤩=r, 🧧, 🥺=l. So the letters are d, a, r, r, [x], l. So the fifth character is x, which is the emoji 🧧. If the name is \"Darryl\", x is 'y', so 🧧=y. But the feedback says that's wrong, so perhaps the name is not Darryl. Let's think of other possibilities. Maybe \"Darryl\" is not the name. Let's think of 6-letter names starting with \"Darr\" and ending with \"l\": \"Darryl\" is the only common one. Maybe it's a typo, or maybe it's a different structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fourth word is \"darryl\" but the emoji is different. Let's check if there's another emoji in the sentence that's not yet identified. The emojis in the encoded sentence are: 🐸, 🤑, 🥺, 🐻, 😈, 🤔, 🦊, t, 🤖, ti, 😎, 🤗, 😴, iz, 🤑, 🤩, d, 🤧, 😴t, 🙄, i, 🐭, 🥴, in, 1967, $750.00. Wait, the emojis are: 🐸, 🤑, 🥺, 🐻, 😈, 🤔, 🦊, 🤖, 😎, 🤗, 😴, 🤩, 🧧, 🙄, 🐭, 🥴. The rest are letters (t, i, z, d, etc.) which are literal. So the only unknown emojis are 🧧 and 🙄.\n\nSo, the known emojis from Attempt 2 feedback are all correct except 🧧. So 🧧 is not 'y'. Let's proceed with the other unknown emoji 🙄. If 🙄=b, then \"starbird\" works. Let's check the fifth part: \"😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d\" → s t a r b i r d → \"starbird\". That works. \n\nSo, the current known emojis are:\n\n🤩=r, 🤑=e, 🥴=h, 🐸=f, 🥺=l, 🐻=o, 😈=w, 🤔=a, 🦊=u, 😴=s, 🤗=c, 🤖=m, 😎=v, 🐭=p. \n\nThe unknown emojis are 🧧 and 🙄. Let's assume 🙄=b (for \"starbird\") and 🧧=y (for \"Darryl\"), even though the feedback said 🧧=y is False. But perhaps the feedback was correct, and I made a mistake. Let's check the other parts again. \n\nAnother part: \"in 1967 🐸🐻🤩\" → in 1967 f o r → \"for\". Correct. \n\n\"🦊😴 $750.00.\" → u s $750.00 → \"us $750.00\". Correct. \n\n\"t🥴🤑\" → t h e → \"the\". Correct. \n\n\"😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑\" → v e h i c l e → \"vehicle\". Correct. \n\n\"🐸🤩🐻🤖\" → f r o m → \"from\". Correct. \n\n\"🤩🐻t🥴\" → r o t h → \"roth\" (maybe a person's last name). \n\n\"🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d\" → p u r c h a s e d → \"purchased\". Correct. \n\n\"🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩\" → c u s t o m i z e r → \"customizer\". Correct. \n\n\"🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑\" → a u t o m o t i v e → \"automotive\". Correct. \n\n\"🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈\" → f e l l o w → \"fellow\". Correct. \n\nSo all the known parts make sense. The only unknowns are the two emojis. Let's see if there's any other clues. The problem says that in each guess, we need to include the hint (🤩=r) and previously correctly answered emojis. Since Attempt 2's feedback says that most were correct except 🧧, so all the emojis in Attempt 2's guess (except 🧧) are correct. So the correct emojis are:\n\n🤩=r, 🤑=e, 🥴=h, 🐸=f, 🥺=l, 🐻=o, 😈=w, 🤔=a, 🦊=u, 😴=s, 🤗=c, 🤖=m, 😎=v, 🐭=p. \n\nThe only emoji from Attempt 2 that was wrong is 🧧, which was guessed as 'y' but is incorrect. So 🧧 is some other letter. But since the encoded sentence includes 🧧, we need to guess it. However, without more context, perhaps we can leave it as unknown, but the problem requires us to submit a guess. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the emoji 🧧 is not present in the encoded sentence. Let me check again. The encoded sentence is:\n\n\"🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈 🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩 d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺 😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d 🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d t🥴🤑 😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑 🐸🤩🐻🤖 🤩🐻t🥴 in 1967 🐸🐻🤩 🦊😴 $750.00.\"\n\nYes, the fourth word has 🧧. So we need to guess 🧧 and 🙄. \n\nGiven that the sentence makes sense with \"Darryl Starbird\", even if the feedback for 🧧=y was False, perhaps the correct answer includes these. Alternatively, maybe the emoji 🙄 is 'b' and 🧧 is 'y' (even though feedback said False), but that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fourth word is \"darryl\" with 🧧=y, and the feedback was a mistake, but the problem says feedback is accurate. So perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let's check the Attempt 2's guess again. \n\nAttempt 2 Guess: 🤩=r, 🤑=e, 🥴=h, 🐸=f, 🥺=l, 🐻=o, 😈=w, 🤔=a, 🦊=u, 😴=s, 🤗=c, 🤖=m, 😎=v, 🐭=p, 🧧=y. \n\nFeedback: {'🤩': True, '🤑': True, '🥴': True, '🐸': True, '🥺': True, '🐻': True, '😈': True, '🤔': True, '🦊': True, '😴': True, '🤗': True, '🤖': True, '😎': True, '🐭': True, '🧧': False}. \n\nSo all the emojis except 🧧 are correct. So the correct mappings are all the ones in the guess except 🧧. So 🧧 is not 'y'. \n\nSo, the fourth word is \"d a r r [x] l\", where x is the letter for 🧧. Since we don't have more info, perhaps x is 'y' but the feedback was wrong, but I think we need to proceed with the information we have. \n\nThe other unknown emoji is 🙄. Let's assume 🙄=b for \"starbird\". \n\nSo, the answer should include all the correct emojis from Attempt 2 (since their feedback was True) plus the hint 🤩=r. So the answer should list all the correct ones plus the new guesses for 🧧 and 🙄. But since we don't know 🧧, perhaps we can leave it, but the problem requires us to submit guesses. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's no need to guess 🧧 and 🙄, but the problem says to submit guesses. Since the user is on attempt 3, they need to make a guess. \n\nGiven that all other emojis are correct, the answer should include all the correct ones from Attempt 2 (since feedback was True) and the hint. So the answer is:\n\n🤩=r, 🤑=e, 🥴=h, 🐸=f, 🥺=l, 🐻=o, 😈=w, 🤔=a, 🦊=u, 😴=s, 🤗=c, 🤖=m, 😎=v, 🐭=p, 🙄=b, 🧧=?\n\nBut we need to guess. Since the fourth word is \"d a r r [x] l\", and the most likely is 'y', even though feedback said False, maybe it's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the emoji 🧧 is 'y' and the feedback was a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fourth word is \"darryl\" and the emoji 🧧=y, and the feedback was a mistake. So the answer would include 🧧=y and 🙄=b. \n\nSo the final answer would be all the correct emojis from Attempt 2, plus the new guesses for 🙄 and 🧧. \n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n🤩=r, 🤑=e, 🥴=h, 🐸=f, 🥺=l, 🐻=o, 😈=w, 🤔=a, 🦊=u, 😴=s, 🤗=c, 🤖=m, 😎=v, 🐭=p, 🙄=b, 🧧=y\n\n\n\nTo solve the Crypto Word Game, we analyze the encoded sentence, hints, and feedback from previous attempts. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Key Information:\n- **Hint**: 🤩=r (confirmed correct).\n- **Attempt 1 Feedback**: 🤩=r (True), 🤑=e (True), 🥴=h (True); others False.\n- **Attempt 2 Feedback**: Most guesses were correct: 🐸=f (True), 🥺=l (True), 🐻=o (True), 😈=w (True), 🤔=a (True), 🦊=u (True), 😴=s (True), 🤗=c (True), 🤖=m (True), 😎=v (True), 🐭=p (True); only 🧧=y (False).\n\n### Substituting Confirmed Emojis:\nUsing the confirmed mappings, we reconstruct parts of the encoded sentence:\n- 🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈 → f e l l o w → \"fellow\"\n- 🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑 → a u t o m o t i v e → \"automotive\"\n- 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩 → c u s t o m i z e r → \"customizer\"\n- 🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d → p u r c h a s e d → \"purchased\"\n- t🥴🤑 → t h e → \"the\"\n- 😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑 → v e h i c l e → \"vehicle\"\n- 🐸🤩🐻🤖 → f r o m → \"from\"\n- 🤩🐻t🥴 → r o t h → \"roth\"\n- in 1967 🐸🐻🤩 → in 1967 f o r → \"in 1967 for\"\n- 🦊😴 $750.00 → u s $750.00 → \"us $750.00\"\n\n### Unknown Emojis:\nTwo emojis remain unknown: 🧧 and 🙄.  \n- **Fourth word**: d🤔🤩🤩🧧🥺 → d a r r [🧧] l. The most plausible name here is \"Darryl,\" suggesting 🧧=y (despite Attempt 2 feedback, as no better alternative fits).  \n- **Fifth word**: 😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d → s t a r [🙄] i r d. The phrase \"starbird\" (a plausible name) fits, suggesting 🙄=b.\n\n### Final Guess:\nIncluding all confirmed emojis and the new guesses for 🧧 and 🙄.\n\nAnswer: 🤩=r,🤑=e,🥴=h,🐸=f,🥺=l,🐻=o,😈=w,🤔=a,🦊=u,😴=s,🤗=c,🤖=m,😎=v,🐭=p,🧧=y,🙄=b","Okay, let's try to figure out the encoded sentence. First, let's list out all the emojis we know from the history and feedback. \n\nFrom the feedback in Attempt 2, most of the guesses were correct. Let's check each:\n\n- 🤩=r (given as hint, and feedback says True)\n- 🤑=e (True)\n- 🥴=h (True)\n- 🐸=f (True)\n- 🥺=l (True)\n- 🐻=o (True)\n- 😈=w (True)\n- 🤔=a (True)\n- 🦊=u (True)\n- 😴=s (True)\n- 🤗=c (True)\n- 🤖=m (True)\n- 😎=v (True)\n- 🐭=p (True)\n- 🧧=y (False, so not correct)\n- 🙄=b (Attempt 3, feedback True)\n\nSo the known mappings so far are:\n\n🤩=r, 🤑=e, 🥴=h, 🐸=f, 🥺=l, 🐻=o, 😈=w, 🤔=a, 🦊=u, 😴=s, 🤗=c, 🤖=m, 😎=v, 🐭=p, 🙄=b.\n\nNow let's substitute these into the encoded sentence to see what we get. Let's parse the sentence step by step.\n\nEncoded Sentence: 🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈 🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩 d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺 😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d 🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d t🥴🤑 😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑 🐸🤩🐻🤖 🤩🐻t🥴 in 1967 🐸🐻🤩 🦊😴 $750.00.\n\nLet's replace each emoji with its known letter:\n\nFirst part: 🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈 → f e l l o w (fellow)\nThat makes sense, \"fellow\" is a word.\n\nNext: 🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑 → a u t o m o t i v e (automotive)\nYes, \"automotive\" fits: a u t o m o t i v e.\n\nThird part: 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩 → c u s t o m i z e r (customizer)\n\"customizer\" is a word: c u s t o m i z e r.\n\nFourth: d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺 → d a r r [unknown] l. Let's see. The structure is d a r r _ l. Maybe \"darrowl\"? Not sure. Let's check the next parts.\n\nFifth: 😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d → s t a r b i r d (starbird). Let's check: s t a (🤔=a) r (🤩=r) b (🙄=b) i r (🤩=r) d. So s t a r b i r d. That could be a name or a word. \"Starbird\" is a possible surname or a term.\n\nSixth: 🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d → p u r c h a s e d (purchased). Let's see: p (🐭=p) u (🦊=u) r (🤩=r) c (🤗=c) h (🥴=h) a (🤔=a) s (😴=s) e (🤑=e) d. Yes! p u r c h a s e d → purchased. That's a perfect fit.\n\nSeventh: t🥴🤑 → t h e (the). t h e → the. That works.\n\nEighth: 😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑 → v e h i c l e (vehicle). v (😎=v) e (🤑=e) h (🥴=h) i c (🤗=c) l (🥺=l) e (🤑=e) → vehicle. Exactly!\n\nNinth: 🐸🤩🐻🤖 → f r o m (from). f (🐸=f) r (🤩=r) o (🐻=o) m (🤖=m) → from.\n\nTenth: 🤩🐻t🥴 → r o t h (roth). r (🤩=r) o (🐻=o) t h (🥴=h) → roth. Maybe a name like Roth.\n\nThen \"in 1967\" is unchanged.\n\nNext: 🐸🐻🤩 → f o r (for). f (🐸=f) o (🐻=o) r (🤩=r) → for.\n\nThen: 🦊😴 → u s (us). u (🦊=u) s (😴=s) → us.\n\nFinally: $750.00. That's the amount.\n\nPutting it all together, let's check each part with substitutions:\n\n1. 🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈 → f e l l o w → fellow ✔️\n2. 🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑 → a u t o m o t i v e → automotive ✔️\n3. 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩 → c u s t o m i z e r → customizer ✔️\n4. d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺 → d a r r [?] l. Let's see the fourth word. The word is \"darr\" followed by an unknown emoji (let's call it X) and then \"l\". The feedback from attempt 2 says 🧧=y was incorrect, so the unknown emoji here is 🧧? Let's check the encoded sentence: the fourth word is \"d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺\". The emojis here are d, 🤔, 🤩, 🤩, 🧧, 🥺. So that's d a r r X l. What could that be? Let's think. Maybe \"darrowl\"? Not common. Alternatively, maybe \"darryl\"? Darryl is a name. If X is y, then \"darryl\". Oh! Because in attempt 2, they guessed 🧧=y, which was False, but maybe the emoji here is 🧧. Let's check: the fourth word's structure is d a r r (🧧) l. If 🧧=y, then \"darryl\" (a name). But attempt 2's feedback says 🧧=y is False. Hmm, but maybe that's correct. Let's check the fifth word again: \"😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d\" → s t a r b i r d → starbird. So that's a name. So \"darryl\" would fit as a name. So perhaps the unknown emoji 🧧=y, even though attempt 2's feedback said False? Wait, no. Let's check the feedback for attempt 2: Feedback: {'🤩': True, '🤑': True, '🥴': True, '🐸': True, '🥺': True, '🐻': True, '😈': True, '🤔': True, '🦊': True, '😴': True, '🤗': True, '🤖': True, '😎': True, '🐭': True, '🧧': False}. So attempt 2 guessed 🧧=y and it was wrong. So the fourth word is d a r r [not y] l. Maybe another letter. Let's think of other possibilities. \"darryl\" is a name, but if the fifth word is \"starbird\", then \"darryl\" could be a first name and \"starbird\" a last name. Alternatively, maybe \"darryl\" is correct, but perhaps the emoji isn't 🧧. Let's check the encoded sentence again. The fourth word is \"d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺\" → d a r r [emoji] l. The emoji in position 5 is 🧧. So the word is d a r r 🧧 l. If the feedback says 🧧=y is False, then what's another letter that fits? Let's think of 5-letter words starting with d, then a, r, r, then a letter, then l. Let's see: \"darryl\" is 6 letters (d-a-r-r-y-l). Oh, right, that's 6 letters. The word here is d (1) 🤔=a (2) 🤩=r (3) 🤩=r (4) 🧧 (5) 🥺=l (6). So 6 letters: d a r r [5] l. So 6 letters: d a r r _ l. Possible options: \"darryl\" (y), \"darrel\" (e), \"darrell\" (l), but that's 7 letters. \"darrel\" is 6 letters: d a r r e l. So if the 5th letter is e, then \"darrel\". So maybe 🧧=e? Let's check if that's possible. Let's look at other parts.\n\nLooking at the third part: \"🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩\" → c u s t o m i z e r. The 'iz' part is 'iz' in the encoded sentence. The original has 'iz' as part of 'customizer', which is correct (customizer: c u s t o m i z e r). So 'iz' is correct.\n\nThe fifth word: \"😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d\" → s t a r b i r d. That's 8 letters: s t a r b i r d. Correct.\n\nThe sixth word: \"🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d\" → p u r c h a s e d. That's 9 letters: p u r c h a s e d. Perfect.\n\nThe seventh word: \"t🥴🤑\" → t h e. Correct.\n\nEighth: \"😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑\" → v e h i c l e. Correct.\n\nNinth: \"🐸🤩🐻🤖\" → f r o m. Correct.\n\nTenth: \"🤩🐻t🥴\" → r o t h. So \"Roth\" is a possible name.\n\nThen \"in 1967\" is as is.\n\nNext: \"🐸🐻🤩\" → f o r. Correct.\n\nThen \"🦊😴\" → u s. Correct.\n\nThe last part is \"$750.00\".\n\nNow, the fourth word is \"d a r r X l\" (d🤔🤩🤩🧧🥺). Let's see if there's any other clue. The fifth word is \"s t a r b i r d\" (😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d). Let's check if \"d a r r X l\" and \"s t a r b i r d\" are names. Maybe \"Darryl Starbird\"? Darryl Starbird is a real person, a custom car builder. Oh! That makes sense. Because the context is automotive, customizer, etc. Let's check:\n\nIf the fourth word is \"Darryl\" (d a r r y l), then X (the emoji) would be y. But attempt 2 guessed 🧧=y and got feedback False. So perhaps the emoji here is not 🧧. Let's check the encoded sentence again. The fourth word is written as \"d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺\". The emojis in order are d, 🤔, 🤩, 🤩, 🧧, 🥺. So yes, the fifth character is 🧧. So if the feedback for attempt 2 says 🧧=y is False, then maybe the correct letter for 🧧 is not y, but perhaps the name is different. Alternatively, maybe the fourth word is \"Darryl\" and the emoji 🧧=y, but the feedback was wrong? No, the feedback is accurate. So perhaps the emoji in the fourth word is not 🧧. Let me check again. The encoded sentence is:\n\nEncoded Sentence: 🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈 🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩 d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺 😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d 🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d t🥴🤑 😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑 🐸🤩🐻🤖 🤩🐻t🥴 in 1967 🐸🐻🤩 🦊😴 $750.00.\n\nYes, the fourth word is \"d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺\", so the emojis are d, 🤔, 🤩, 🤩, 🧧, 🥺. So that's 6 characters: d, a, r, r, 🧧, l. So the word is d a r r [🧧] l.\n\nIf \"Darryl Starbird\" is a person, then \"Darryl\" would require 🧧=y, but attempt 2 said that was incorrect. So perhaps the correct letter for 🧧 is something else. Let's think of another 6-letter name starting with darr and ending with l. \"Darrel\" (d a r r e l). So if 🧧=e, then \"darrel\". That's possible. Let's check if that fits. But is there any other clue?\n\nLooking at the third part: \"customizer\" is correct. The second part is \"automotive\", which fits. The first part \"fellow\" makes sense. The sixth part \"purchased\" is correct, seventh \"the\", eighth \"vehicle\", ninth \"from\", tenth \"roth\" (maybe a last name), then \"in 1967 for us $750.00\". That makes sense.\n\nAnother thing to check: Are there any other unknown emojis? Let's list all emojis in the encoded sentence:\n\nEmojis present: 🐸, 🤑, 🥺, 🐻, 😈, 🤔, 🦊, t, 🤖, ti, 😎, 🤗, 😴, iz, 🤩, d, 🧧, 😴t, 🙄, i, 🐭, 🥴, t🥴, in, 1967, $750.00.\n\nWait, but \"t\", \"ti\", \"iz\", \"d\", \"i\", \"in\" are letters, not emojis. The actual emojis are:\n\n🐸, 🤑, 🥺, 🐻, 😈, 🤔, 🦊, 🤖, 😎, 🤗, 😴, 🤩, 🧧, 🙄, 🐭, 🥴.\n\nFrom the history, all these emojis have been guessed except maybe some. Let's list:\n\nAttempt 1: 🤩, 🤑, 🥴, 🐻, 🐸, 🤖 → some correct, some not.\n\nAttempt 2: added 🥺, 😈, 🤔, 🦊, 😴, 🤗, 😎, 🐭, 🧧 → feedback says all except 🧧 were correct.\n\nAttempt 3: added 🙄 → feedback True.\n\nSo all emojis in the encoded sentence are accounted for except perhaps the letters like 't', 'i', 'd', etc., which are regular letters, not emojis. So the only emoji left with unknown mapping is 🧧 (since attempt 2 guessed it as y and it was wrong). \n\nIn the fourth word, \"d a r r 🧧 l\", if 🧧 is not y, what else could it be? Let's think of other possibilities. Maybe \"darryl\" is correct, but perhaps the feedback was a mistake. But the user says the feedback is accurate. Alternatively, maybe the fourth word is \"darryl\" and the emoji is correct as y, but the attempt 2's guess for 🧧=y was wrong. So perhaps the emoji in the fourth word is not 🧧? Let me check again. The encoded sentence shows \"d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺\" → the fifth emoji is 🧧. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fourth word is \"darryl\" and the emoji 🧧=y, but the feedback for attempt 2 was incorrect. But that's unlikely. The user says feedback is accurate. So perhaps the correct answer includes all the known emojis, and the only unknown is 🧧, but in the current attempt, we need to list all known emojis (including the hint and previously correct ones) and any new guesses. But according to the note: \"the emoji provided as a hint, as well as previously correctly answered emojis, must also be included in your answer.\"\n\nSo the answer should include all the emojis that are known to be correct (from the feedback) plus any new guesses. But in the history, all emojis except 🧧 have been confirmed correct. Let's confirm:\n\nAttempt 2's feedback: all except 🧧 were True. So:\n\n🤩=r (True), 🤑=e (True), 🥴=h (True), 🐸=f (True), 🥺=l (True), 🐻=o (True), 😈=w (True), 🤔=a (True), 🦊=u (True), 😴=s (True), 🤗=c (True), 🤖=m (True), 😎=v (True), 🐭=p (True), 🧧=y (False).\n\nAttempt 3 added 🙄=b (True).\n\nSo the known correct mappings are:\n\n🤩=r, 🤑=e, 🥴=h, 🐸=f, 🥺=l, 🐻=o, 😈=w, 🤔=a, 🦊=u, 😴=s, 🤗=c, 🤖=m, 😎=v, 🐭=p, 🙄=b.\n\nThe only emoji with unknown mapping is 🧧 (since attempt 2's guess was wrong). But the encoded sentence has \"d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺\" → d a r r [🧧] l. Let's see if there's any other clue. The fifth word is \"😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d\" → s t a r b i r d (Starbird), which is a last name. So the fourth word is likely a first name. If \"Starbird\" is the last name, the first name could be \"Darryl\" (Darryl Starbird is a real person known for custom cars, which fits the context of automotive and customizer). So even though attempt 2 guessed 🧧=y as False, perhaps that's the correct answer. Maybe the feedback was a mistake, but according to the problem, feedback is accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the emoji is different. Let's check again. The encoded sentence's fourth word is \"d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺\". The emojis here are d, 🤔=a, 🤩=r, 🤩=r, 🧧, 🥺=l. So \"d a r r [🧧] l\". If the correct name is \"Darryl\", then [🧧] is y. So even if attempt 2's guess was wrong, perhaps in this attempt, we need to confirm. But the user says that previous correct answers must be included. So all the emojis with True feedback must be in the answer. The answer format requires including the hint (🤩=r) and all previously correctly answered emojis. So the answer should list all the known correct mappings. Since all except 🧧 are known, but the problem might not require guessing 🧧 if we don't have info, but perhaps in this case, the sentence makes sense with the known mappings, so the answer is all the correct ones. Let's list them:\n\n🤩=r, 🤑=e, 🥴=h, 🐸=f, 🥺=l, 🐻=o, 😈=w, 🤔=a, 🦊=u, 😴=s, 🤗=c, 🤖=m, 😎=v, 🐭=p, 🙄=b.\n\nThese are all confirmed by the feedback. The only unknown is 🧧, but since the problem says \"submit your guesses for this round\", and we need to include all previously correct ones, even if there are no new guesses, we list the known ones. But perhaps the user expects that we have all the necessary mappings to form the sentence, so maybe there's no need to guess 🧧. Let's confirm the entire sentence with the known mappings:\n\nEncoded Sentence substitution:\n\n1. 🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈 → f e l l o w → fellow ✔️\n2. 🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑 → a u t o m o t i v e → automotive ✔️\n3. 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩 → c u s t o m i z e r → customizer ✔️\n4. d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺 → d a r r [?] l → maybe \"darryl\" (if 🧧=y)\n5. 😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d → s t a r b i r d → starbird ✔️\n6. 🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d → p u r c h a s e d → purchased ✔️\n7. t🥴🤑 → t h e → the ✔️\n8. 😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑 → v e h i c l e → vehicle ✔️\n9. 🐸🤩🐻🤖 → f r o m → from ✔️\n10. 🤩🐻t🥴 → r o t h → roth ✔️\n11. in 1967 → in 1967 ✔️\n12. 🐸🐻🤩 → f o r → for ✔️\n13. 🦊😴 → u s → us ✔️\n14. $750.00 → $750.00 ✔️\n\nThe only part that's unclear is the fourth word, but the rest makes sense. So the answer should include all the known correct emojis.\n\n🤩=r, 🤑=e, 🥴=h, 🐸=f, 🥺=l, 🐻=o, 😈=w, 🤔=a, 🦊=u, 😴=s, 🤗=c, 🤖=m, 😎=v, 🐭=p, 🙄=b\n\nAnswer: 🤩=r,🤑=e,🥴=h,🐸=f,🥺=l,🐻=o,😈=w,🤔=a,🦊=u,😴=s,🤗=c,🤖=m,😎=v,🐭=p,🙄=b","Okay, let's try to figure out the encoded sentence now. First, let's list out all the emojis that have been confirmed correct from the history. \n\nFrom the feedback, the correct mappings so far are:\n- 🤩=r (given as a hint and confirmed)\n- 🤑=e (confirmed)\n- 🥴=h (confirmed)\n- 🐸=f (confirmed in attempt 2)\n- 🥺=l (confirmed in attempt 2)\n- 🐻=o (confirmed in attempt 2)\n- 😈=w (confirmed in attempt 2)\n- 🤔=a (confirmed in attempt 2)\n- 🦊=u (confirmed in attempt 2)\n- 😴=s (confirmed in attempt 2)\n- 🤗=c (confirmed in attempt 2)\n- 🤖=m (confirmed in attempt 2)\n- 😎=v (confirmed in attempt 2)\n- 🐭=p (confirmed in attempt 2)\n- 🙄=b (confirmed in attempt 3)\n\nThe only emoji in the encoded sentence that's not yet mapped is 🧧, but in attempt 2, the guess for 🧧=y was marked as False, so maybe it's not present in the sentence. Let's check the encoded sentence again to see which emojis are there.\n\nEncoded Sentence: 🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈 🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩 d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺 😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d 🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d t🥴🤑 😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑 🐸🤩🐻🤖 🤩🐻t🥴 in 1967 🐸🐻🤩 🦊😴 $750.00.\n\nLet's substitute the known emojis with their letters:\n\nFirst part: 🐸=f, 🤑=e, 🥺=l, 🥺=l, 🐻=o, 😈=w → f e l l o w \n\nNext: 🤔=a, 🦊=u, t, 🐻=o, 🤖=m, 🐻=o, t, i, 😎=v, 🤑=e → a u t o m o t i v e \n\nThen: 🤗=c, 🦊=u, 😴=s, t, 🐻=o, 🤖=m, i, z, 🤑=e, 🤩=r → c u s t o m i z e r \n\nNext: d, 🤔=a, 🤩=r, 🤩=r, 🧧 (unknown), 🥺=l → d a r r [unknown] l \n\nThen: 😴=s, t, 🤔=a, 🤩=r, 🙄=b, i, 🤩=r, d → s t a r b i r d \n\nNext: 🐭=p, 🦊=u, 🤩=r, 🤗=c, 🥴=h, 🤔=a, 😴=s, 🤑=e, d → p u r c h a s e d \n\nThen: t, 🥴=h, 🤑=e → t h e \n\nNext: 😎=v, 🤑=e, 🥴=h, i, 🤗=c, 🥺=l, 🤑=e → v e h i c l e \n\nThen: 🐸=f, 🤩=r, 🐻=o, 🤖=m → f r o m \n\nNext: 🤩=r, 🐻=o, t, 🥴=h → r o t h \n\nThen: in 1967 🐸=f, 🐻=o, 🤩=r → f o r \n\nNext: 🦊=u, 😴=s → u s \n\nThen: $750.00.\n\nPutting it all together with substitutions:\n\nfellow aut motive customizer darr[X]l starbird purchased the vehicle from roth in 1967 for us $750.00.\n\nLooking at the parts where there are unknowns. Let's check the third word: \"customizer\" makes sense (cust om izer → customizer). \n\nThe fourth word: \"darr[X]l\" — possible words. The structure is d a r r [X] l. Let's see. Maybe \"darr\" + [X] + \"l\". Possible words: \"darnell\"? D a r n e l l. So [X] would be 'n'. The emoji here is 🧧, which was guessed as y (incorrect). So maybe 🧧=n.\n\nCheck the fifth part: \"starbird\" — s t a r b i r d. That works with 🙄=b (st Arb ird → starbird).\n\nAnother possible unknown: in the third part, \"customizer\" — the part is \"cust o m i z e r\" which matches \"customizer\". \n\nThe second part: \"aut motive\" — that's \"automotive\" (a u t o m o t i v e), which is correct.\n\nThe first part: \"fellow\" (f e l l o w), correct.\n\nSo the only unknown emoji in the encoded sentence is 🧧, which is in the word \"darr[X]l\". If that's \"darnell\", then 🧧=n. Let's check if that fits. The fourth word would be \"darnell\" (d a r r n l). That makes sense. So the guess should include all the correct emojis from history plus the new one if needed. But looking at the encoded sentence, the only emoji not yet mapped is 🧧. Let's confirm.\n\nEncoded sentence has: 🧧. So in attempt 2, the guess was 🧧=y (feedback False). Now, if we guess 🧧=n, that's a possibility.\n\nWait, let's check the full substituted sentence again:\n\nEncoded: 🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈 → fellow (f e l l o w) ✔️\n\n🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑 → a u t o m o t i v e (automotive) ✔️\n\n🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩 → c u s t o m i z e r (customizer) ✔️\n\nd🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺 → d a r r [🧧] l → darr[🧧]l. If it's \"darnell\", then [🧧]=n. So d a r r n l → darnell.\n\n😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d → s t a r b i r d (starbird) ✔️ (since 🙄=b, s t a r b i r d)\n\n🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d → p u r c h a s e d (purchased) ✔️\n\nt🥴🤑 → t h e (the) ✔️\n\n😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑 → v e h i c l e (vehicle) ✔️ (v e h i c l e)\n\n🐸🤩🐻🤖 → f r o m (from) ✔️\n\n🤩🐻t🥴 → r o t h (roth) ✔️\n\nin 1967 🐸🐻🤩 → f o r (for) ✔️\n\n🦊😴 → u s (us) ✔️\n\n$750.00.\n\nSo the only missing emoji is 🧧 which is in \"darr[🧧]l\" → \"darnell\" (assuming). So 🧧=n.\n\nNow, the answer should include all the correct emojis from the history, as per the note: \"the emoji provided as a hint, as well as previously correctly answered emojis, must also be included in your answer.\"\n\nSo list all the correct mappings:\n\n🤩=r, 🤑=e, 🥴=h, 🐸=f, 🥺=l, 🐻=o, 😈=w, 🤔=a, 🦊=u, 😴=s, 🤗=c, 🤖=m, 😎=v, 🐭=p, 🙄=b, and now 🧧=n (if that's correct).\n\nWait, but let's check if there are any other emojis in the encoded sentence. Let's list all emojis in the encoded sentence:\n\n🐸, 🤑, 🥺, 🐻, 😈, 🤔, 🦊, t, 🤖, ti, 😎, 🤗, 😴, t, iz, d, 🧧, 😴t, 🙄i, 🐭, 🥴, d, t, 😎, i, 🐸, 🤩, in, 1967, 🐸, 🐻, 🦊, 😴, $750.00.\n\nWait, the 't', 'i', 'z', 'd' are lowercase letters, not emojis. The emojis are: 🐸, 🤑, 🥺, 🐻, 😈, 🤔, 🦊, 🤖, 😎, 🤗, 😴, 🧧, 🙄, 🐭, 🥴, 🤩.\n\nFrom the history, all these emojis except 🧧 have been confirmed. 🧧 was guessed as y (False), and now we're guessing it's n. Let's check if that's the only one.\n\nYes, the encoded sentence includes 🧧 once in \"d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺\" which is \"d a r r 🧧 l\". So if that's \"darnell\", then 🧧=n.\n\nSo the answer should include all the correct ones plus 🧧=n.\n\n🤩=r,🤑=e,🥴=h,🐸=f,🥺=l,🐻=o,😈=w,🤔=a,🦊=u,😴=s,🤗=c,🤖=m,😎=v,🐭=p,🙄=b,🧧=n\nAnswer: 🤩=r,🤑=e,🥴=h,🐸=f,🥺=l,🐻=o,😈=w,🤔=a,🦊=u,😴=s,🤗=c,🤖=m,😎=v,🐭=p,🙄=b,🧧=n","Okay, let's try to figure out the encoded sentence. First, let's list out all the emojis and their confirmed meanings from the history. \n\nFrom the history, the feedback tells us which emojis are correct. Let's check each attempt:\n\nAttempt 1: 🤩=r (True), 🤑=e (True), 🥴=h (True), 🐻=a (False), 🐸=c (False), 🤖=b (False). So 🤩=r, 🤑=e, 🥴=h are confirmed.\n\nAttempt 2: They added several emojis. The feedback says 🐸=f (True), 🥺=l (True), 🐻=o (True), 😈=w (True), 🤔=a (True), 🦊=u (True), 😴=s (True), 🤗=c (True), 🤖=m (True), 😎=v (True), 🐭=p (True), 🧧=y (False). So these are confirmed: 🐸=f, 🥺=l, 🐻=o, 😈=w, 🤔=a, 🦊=u, 😴=s, 🤗=c, 🤖=m, 😎=v, 🐭=p.\n\nAttempt 3: Added 🙄=b (True). So 🙄=b is confirmed.\n\nAttempt 4: Same as 3, all True.\n\nAttempt 5: Tried 🧧=n (False). So 🧧 is still unknown.\n\nSo the known mappings are:\n\n🤩=r, 🤑=e, 🥴=h, 🐸=f, 🥺=l, 🐻=o, 😈=w, 🤔=a, 🦊=u, 😴=s, 🤗=c, 🤖=m, 😎=v, 🐭=p, 🙄=b.\n\nThe remaining emojis in the encoded sentence that aren't yet mapped are: 🧧, and maybe others? Let's check the encoded sentence:\n\nEncoded Sentence: 🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈 🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩 d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺 😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d 🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d t🥴🤑 😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑 🐸🤩🐻🤖 🤩🐻t🥴 in 1967 🐸🐻🤩 🦊😴 $750.00.\n\nWait, let's break down each part, replacing known emojis:\n\nFirst part: 🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈 → f e l l o w (since 🐸=f, 🤑=e, 🥺=l, 🐻=o, 😈=w. So \"fellow\" → that makes sense!\n\nNext: 🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑 → a u t o m o t i v e (🤔=a, 🦊=u, 🐻=o, 🤖=m, 😎=v, 🤑=e. So \"automotive\" → \"automotiv\" plus 'e' → \"automotive\" → yes, that works. The letters here: a u t o m o t i v e. So the part is \"automotive\".\n\nThird part: 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩 → c u s t o m i z e r (🤗=c, 🦊=u, 😴=s, 🐻=o, 🤖=m, 🤑=e, 🤩=r. So \"customizer\" → \"c u s t o m i z e r\" → \"customizer\". That fits.\n\nFourth part: d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺 → d a r r ? l (d a r r [unknown] l). The word here, let's see. Maybe \"darrl\"? But \"darrl\" is a name. Alternatively, perhaps the missing emoji is 'y'? Let's check the history: in attempt 2, 🧧=y was tried and failed. Attempt 5 tried 🧧=n, which failed. So the emoji here is 🧧, since the part is d a r r 🧧 l. Let's check the original encoded sentence: \"d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺\" → d a r r 🧧 l. So the word is \"darr\" + 🧧 + \"l\".\n\nNext part: 😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d → s t a r b i r d (😴=s, 🤔=a, 🤩=r, 🙄=b. So s t a r b i r d → \"starbird\". That makes sense.\n\nNext: 🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d → p u r c h a s e d (🐭=p, 🦊=u, 🤩=r, 🤗=c, 🥴=h, 🤔=a, 😴=s, 🤑=e. So \"purchased\" → p u r c h a s e d. Perfect! That's \"purchased\".\n\nThen: t🥴🤑 → t h e (🥴=h, 🤑=e. So \"the\".)\n\nNext: 😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑 → v e h i c l e (😎=v, 🤑=e, 🥴=h, 🤗=c, 🥺=l. So \"vehicle\" → v e h i c l e. Correct.)\n\nThen: 🐸🤩🐻🤖 → f r o m (🐸=f, 🤩=r, 🐻=o, 🤖=m. So \"from\".)\n\nNext: 🤩🐻t🥴 → r o t h (🤩=r, 🐻=o, 🥴=h. So \"roth\". Maybe a name.)\n\nThen \"in 1967\" is unchanged.\n\nNext: 🐸🐻🤩 → f o r (🐸=f, 🐻=o, 🤩=r. So \"for\".)\n\nThen: 🦊😴 → u s (🦊=u, 😴=s. So \"us\".)\n\nFinally: $750.00.\n\nPutting it all together with the known mappings:\n\n\"fellow automotive customizer darr[🧧]l starbird purchased the vehicle from roth in 1967 for us $750.00.\"\n\nLooking at the word \"darr[🧧]l\". The missing letter is between 'r' and 'l'. The word could be \"darr yl\" → but that's \"darryl\". Oh! \"Darryl\" is a common name. So the missing emoji is 'y', but in attempt 2, they guessed 🧧=y and got feedback False. Wait, the fourth part in the encoded sentence is \"d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺\" → d a r r 🧧 l. So the letters are d a r r [emoji] l. If the word is \"darryl\", then the missing emoji would be 'y'. But attempt 2 had 🧧=y and feedback was False. So perhaps the emoji isn't 🧧? Let's check the original encoded sentence again. The fourth part is \"d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺\" → d a r r [🤧] l. Oh, the emoji here is 🤧, not 🧧. Oh, I made a mistake earlier. The encoded sentence has \"d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺\" → the emoji is 🤧 (sneezing face) not 🧧 (red envelope). Oh right! So in the history, attempt 2 had \"🧧=y\" (Feedback: {'🧧': False}), attempt 5 \"🧧=n\" (False). So the emoji in the fourth part is 🤧, not 🧧. So 🤧 is the missing one here.\n\nSo let's correct that. The fourth part is d a r r 🤧 l. So the word is \"darr\" + 🤧 + \"l\". If it's \"darryl\", then 🤧=y. Let's check if that makes sense. Let's confirm all other parts.\n\nAnother part: \"t🥴🤑\" → t h e → \"the\" (correct). \n\n\"😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑\" → v e h i c l e → \"vehicle\" (correct).\n\n\"🐸🤩🐻🤖\" → f r o m → \"from\" (correct).\n\n\"🤩🐻t🥴\" → r o t h → \"roth\" (surname).\n\n\"🐸🐻🤩\" → f o r → \"for\" (correct).\n\n\"🦊😴\" → u s → \"us\" (correct).\n\nSo the only remaining emoji is 🤧. Let's look at the fourth word: \"d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺\" → d a r r 🤧 l. If that's \"darryl\", then 🤧=y. Let's check if there's any other possible word. \"Darryl\" is a common name. Let's see if that fits. \n\nAre there any other emojis left in the encoded sentence? Let's check the entire sentence again:\n\nEncoded Sentence: 🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈 (fellow) 🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑 (automotive) 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩 (customizer) d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺 (darr[🤧]l) 😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d (starbird) 🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d (purchased) t🥴🤑 (the) 😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑 (vehicle) 🐸🤩🐻🤖 (from) 🤩🐻t🥴 (roth) in 1967 🐸🐻🤩 (for) 🦊😴 (us) $750.00.\n\nYes, the only emoji left is 🤧. The word \"darr[🤧]l\" → \"darryl\" makes sense, so 🤧=y. Let's check if that's possible. The user hasn't guessed 🤧 yet. In the history, attempts 2 and 5 guessed 🧧 (red envelope) as y and n, which were wrong, but the emoji here is 🤧 (sneezing face). So we need to guess 🤧=y.\n\nLet me confirm all the known mappings and the new one:\n\n🤩=r, 🤑=e, 🥴=h, 🐸=f, 🥺=l, 🐻=o, 😈=w, 🤔=a, 🦊=u, 😴=s, 🤗=c, 🤖=m, 😎=v, 🐭=p, 🙄=b, 🤧=y.\n\nThat should cover all emojis in the encoded sentence. Let's check if all parts make sense with these mappings:\n\n- 🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈 → f e l l o w → \"fellow\" ✔️\n- 🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑 → a u t o m o t i v e → \"automotive\" ✔️ (the 't' and 'i' are actual letters, not emojis, so they are part of the original sentence)\n- 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩 → c u s t o m i z e r → \"customizer\" ✔️ (the 'iz' are letters)\n- d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺 → d a r r y l → \"darryl\" ✔️ (assuming 🤧=y)\n- 😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d → s t a r b i r d → \"starbird\" ✔️\n- 🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d → p u r c h a s e d → \"purchased\" ✔️\n- t🥴🤑 → t h e → \"the\" ✔️\n- 😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑 → v e h i c l e → \"vehicle\" ✔️\n- 🐸🤩🐻🤖 → f r o m → \"from\" ✔️\n- 🤩🐻t🥴 → r o t h → \"roth\" ✔️\n- 🐸🐻🤩 → f o r → \"for\" ✔️\n- 🦊😴 → u s → \"us\" ✔️\n\nEverything fits! So the missing emoji is 🤧=y.\n\nTo solve the Crypto Word Game, we start by analyzing the provided encoded sentence, hint, and history of guesses. The history confirms the following correct mappings:\n\n- 🤩=r (given as a hint and confirmed)\n- 🤑=e, 🥴=h (confirmed in Attempt 1)\n- 🐸=f, 🥺=l, 🐻=o, 😈=w, 🤔=a, 🦊=u, 😴=s, 🤗=c, 🤖=m, 😎=v, 🐭=p (confirmed in Attempt 2)\n- 🙄=b (confirmed in Attempt 3)\n\nNext, we decode the encoded sentence using these known mappings:\n\n1. 🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈 → f e l l o w → \"fellow\"  \n2. 🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑 → a u t o m o t i v e → \"automotive\"  \n3. 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩 → c u s t o m i z e r → \"customizer\"  \n4. d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺 → d a r r [unknown] l  \n5. 😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d → s t a r b i r d → \"starbird\"  \n6. 🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d → p u r c h a s e d → \"purchased\"  \n7. t🥴🤑 → t h e → \"the\"  \n8. 😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑 → v e h i c l e → \"vehicle\"  \n9. 🐸🤩🐻🤖 → f r o m → \"from\"  \n10. 🤩🐻t🥴 → r o t h → \"roth\"  \n11. 🐸🐻🤩 → f o r → \"for\"  \n12. 🦊😴 → u s → \"us\"  \n\nThe only remaining unknown emoji is 🤧 in the fourth part: \"d a r r 🤧 l\". The most plausible word here is \"darryl\" (a common name), which implies 🤧=y. \n\nAnswer: 🤩=r,🤑=e,🥴=h,🐸=f,🥺=l,🐻=o,😈=w,🤔=a,🦊=u,😴=s,🤗=c,🤖=m,😎=v,🐭=p,🙄=b,🤧=y"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The encoded sentence is: 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 🐵👽 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 1983. And we know that 🥵=e. \n\nFirst, let's list out all the emojis and their positions. The hint gives us 🥵=e, so every 🥵 in the sentence is 'e'. Let's replace those first. Let's rewrite the sentence with 🥵 replaced by e:\n\nOriginal: 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 🐵👽 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 1983.\n\nAfter replacing 🥵=e:\n\n🐹😇🐔🐔e🥺😴e🥶 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 👽🐹e🥶😇🐵e🧐 🐵👽 🦆👽🥶🐼e🐔 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 1983.\n\nNow, let's look for word boundaries. The sentence is split into words by spaces. Let's list the words:\n\n1. 🐹😇🐔🐔e🥺😴e🥶 (length 9)\n2. 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 (length 6)\n3. 👽🐹e🥶😇🐵e🧐 (length 8)\n4. 🐵👽 (length 2)\n5. 🦆👽🥶🐼e🐔 (length 6)\n6. 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 (length 5)\n7. 1983 (numbers, probably part of the sentence, maybe a year)\n\nLet's analyze each word.\n\nStarting with word 4: 🐵👽 (2 letters). Common 2-letter words are 'it', 'is', 'in', 'on', 'at', 'to', 'of', 'as', 'he', 'she', 'we', 'an', 'or', 'so', 'up', 'if', 'by', 'be', 'my', 'no', 'go', 'me', 'us'. Let's hold that thought.\n\nWord 3: 👽🐹e🥶😇🐵e🧐 (8 letters). The structure is [A][B]e[C][D][E]e[F]. So positions 3 and 7 are 'e'. Let's think about 8-letter words with 'e's in positions 3 and 7. For example, 'because' has e in position 3 (but length 7), 'different' (e in position 3: d-i-f-f-e-r-e-n-t, positions 5 and 7: e and e? Let's check: positions 1: d, 2:i, 3:f, 4:f, 5:e, 6:r, 7:e, 8:n, 9:t. So 8 letters would be 'differen' (positions 1-8: d-i-f-f-e-r-e-n). That's 8 letters, with e in 5 and 7. Hmm, maybe not. Another example: 'together' (t-o-g-e-t-h-e-r). Let's check positions: 1:t, 2:o, 3:g, 4:e, 5:t, 6:h, 7:e, 8:r. So positions 4 and 7 are 'e's. The word here is [A][B]e[C][D][E]e[F], so 3rd character is 'e' (position 3 in the word). Let's index the word as positions 1-8: 1=👽, 2=🐹, 3=e (since 🥵=e), 4=🥶, 5=😇, 6=🐵, 7=e (🥵=e), 8=🧐. So the word structure is: 1 2 e 4 5 6 e 8. So 3rd and 7th letters are 'e'. Let's think of 8-letter words with 'e' in positions 3 and 7. Let's list possibilities. For example, 'beforely' (unlikely), 'breezew' (no), 'celebree' (maybe not). Alternatively, maybe it's a word like 'generate' (g-e-n-e-r-a-t-e) no, positions 2 and 4. 'Segregat' (s-e-g-r-e-g-a-t), positions 2 and 5. 'Beneveld' (b-e-n-e-v-e-l-d), positions 2,4,6. Not matching. Maybe 'rebound' is 7 letters. 'Resemble' (r-e-s-e-m-b-l-e) 8 letters: positions 2 and 4 are 'e's. No. Hmm.\n\nWord 2: 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 (6 letters). Let's see. If word 4 is 🐵👽 (2 letters), maybe 🐵 is a common letter. Let's assume word 4 is 'it' (i-t). Then 🐵=i, 👽=t. Let's test that. If 🐵=i, then word 4 would be i-t, which is 'it' (possible). Let's check that. Then, word 2 is i [🥶] [😇] [🤑] [🥺] [🐔]. So 6 letters: i _ _ _ _ _. Common 6-letter words starting with 'i' are 'image', 'inbox', 'inlet', 'input', 'issue', 'index', 'inner', 'items', 'ideas', 'insect', 'inside', etc. Let's see. If 🐵=i, then word 3 (👽🐹e🥶😇🐵e🧐) would start with 👽, which if 👽=t (from word 4 being 'it'), then 👽=t. So word 3 is t [🐹] e [🥶] [😇] i e [🧐]. So t _ e _ _ i e _. 8-letter word. Let's think: 'terrible' (t-e-r-r-i-b-l-e) but 8 letters: t-e-r-r-i-b-l-e (positions 1-8: t, e, r, r, i, b, l, e). That fits! Let's check: t (👽) [🐹] (e in position 2 of word 3: the second character is 🐹, which would be 'e' if the word is 'terrible' (t-e-r-r-i-b-l-e). Wait, word 3: 👽=t, 2nd character is 🐹, 3rd is e (since 🥵=e). So 👽🐹e... would be t [🐹] e. In 'terrible', the letters are t (1), e (2), r (3), r (4), i (5), b (6), l (7), e (8). Oh! The third character of the word is position 3, which is 'r' in 'terrible', but in our case, position 3 of word 3 is e (because 🥵=e). So that doesn't fit. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's reindex. The third character of word 3 is the third emoji, which is 🥵, which is e. So the word is:\n\nPosition 1: 👽 (t if 👽=t)\nPosition 2: 🐹\nPosition 3: e (from 🥵=e)\nPosition 4: 🥶\nPosition 5: 😇\nPosition 6: 🐵 (i if 🐵=i)\nPosition 7: e (from 🥵=e)\nPosition 8: 🧐\n\nSo the letters are: t, [🐹], e, [🥶], [😇], i, e, [🧐]. So the structure is t _ e _ _ i e _. Let's think of 8-letter words with this pattern. Let's see. 'Treasure' (t-r-e-a-s-u-r-e) but 8 letters: t (1), r (2), e (3), a (4), s (5), u (6), r (7), e (8). So positions 3 and 8 are e. Not matching. 'Trembles' (t-r-e-m-b-l-e-s) 8 letters: t(1), r(2), e(3), m(4), b(5), l(6), e(7), s(8). Oh! That fits! Let's check:\n\nt (1) = 👽=t\n\nr (2) = 🐹\n\ne (3) = e (correct, 🥵=e)\n\nm (4) = 🥶\n\nb (5) = 😇\n\nl (6) = 🐵=l? Wait, but we assumed 🐵=i earlier. That conflicts. Hmm. If word 4 is 🐵👽, which would be l-t? 'lt' isn't a common word. Maybe my initial assumption about word 4 is wrong. Let's try another 2-letter word. 'he' (h-e), 'she' (s-h-e) is 3 letters. 'we' (w-e), 'it' (i-t), 'is' (i-s), 'in' (i-n), 'on' (o-n), 'at' (a-t), 'to' (t-o), 'of' (o-f), 'as' (a-s), 'or' (o-r), 'so' (s-o), 'up' (u-p), 'if' (i-f), 'by' (b-y), 'be' (b-e), 'my' (m-y), 'no' (n-o), 'go' (g-o), 'me' (m-e), 'us' (u-s).\n\nLet's consider word 6: 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 (5 letters). Let's say if 🐵 is a common letter like 't' (since 't' is common). If word 4 is 🐵👽, maybe 'to' (t-o), so 🐵=t, 👽=o. Let's test that. Then word 4 is t-o='to'. Then word 3 is 👽=o, so 👽=o. Word 3: o [🐹] e [🥶] [😇] t e [🧐]. So o _ e _ _ t e _. 8-letter word. Let's think: 'obeying' (o-b-e-y-i-n-g) no. 'Overtones' (o-v-e-r-t-o-n-e-s) 9 letters. 'Overtest' (o-v-e-r-t-e-s-t) 8 letters: o(1), v(2), e(3), r(4), t(5), e(6), s(7), t(8). So positions 3 and 6 are e. So the structure would be o v e r t e s t. So in our case, word 3 is o [🐹] e [🥶] [😇] t e [🧐]. So if it's 'overtest', then:\n\no (1) = 👽=o\n\nv (2) = 🐹=v\n\ne (3) = e (correct)\n\nr (4) = 🥶=r\n\nt (5) = 😇=t\n\nt (6) = 🐵=t (matches our assumption)\n\ne (7) = e (correct)\n\ns (8) = 🧐=s\n\nSo that fits! Let's check: word 3 would be 'overtest' (o-v-e-r-t-t-e-s? Wait, 'overtest' is o-v-e-r-t-e-s-t (positions 1-8: o, v, e, r, t, e, s, t). So 6th character is e, 7th is s, 8th is t. Hmm, maybe not. Let's try another angle.\n\nLooking at word 1: 🐹😇🐔🐔e🥺😴e🥶 (9 letters). Structure: [A][B][C][C]e[D][E]e[F]. So letters 4 and 7 are e. So 9-letter word with e in positions 5 and 8 (since the 5th emoji is 🥵=e, and 8th is 🥵=e). So positions 5 and 8 are e. Let's count: 1:🐹, 2:😇, 3:🐔, 4:🐔, 5:e, 6:🥺, 7:😴, 8:e, 9:🥶. So 9-letter word: A B C C e D E e F. Common 9-letter words with e in positions 5 and 8. For example, 'committee' (c-o-m-m-i-t-t-e-e) has e in positions 8 and 9. 'September' (s-e-p-t-e-m-b-e-r) has e in positions 2,5,8. Let's check: s (1), e (2), p (3), t (4), e (5), m (6), b (7), e (8), r (9). So structure: A= s, B= e, C= p, C= t? No, 3 and 4 would be p and t, which are different. 'Wednesday' (w-e-d-n-e-s-d-a-y) no. 'Together' (t-o-g-e-t-h-e-r) is 8 letters. 'Different' (d-i-f-f-e-r-e-n-t) 9 letters: positions 1:d, 2:i, 3:f, 4:f, 5:e, 6:r, 7:e, 8:n, 9:t. Oh! That fits! Let's check:\n\nd (1) = 🐹\n\ni (2) = 😇\n\nf (3) = 🐔\n\nf (4) = 🐔 (since 3 and 4 are the same emoji, so same letter. 'different' has 3 and 4 as 'f's, which matches)\n\ne (5) = e (correct, 🥵=e)\n\nr (6) = 🥺\n\ne (7) = 😴 (because position 7 is 😴, which in 'different' is 'e' at position 7, so 😴=e? Wait, no. Wait, the 7th character in the encoded word is 😴, and in 'different', position 7 is 'e'. So if 'different' is the word, then 😴=e. But we already have 🥵=e, and the problem states each emoji is a unique letter. So that's a conflict. So 😴 can't be e. So 'different' is out.\n\nAnother 9-letter word: 'beautiful' (b-e-a-u-t-i-f-u-l) positions 5 is t, 8 is u. No. 'Benefited' (b-e-n-e-f-i-t-e-d) 9 letters: positions 1:b, 2:e, 3:n, 4:e, 5:f, 6:i, 7:t, 8:e, 9:d. So e in positions 2,4,8. Structure: A B C C e D E e F. Here, positions 2 and 4 are e (so B and C would be e, but 3 and 4 are same emoji, so C=C. In 'benefited', 3 is n, 4 is e, so 3 and 4 are different, so no.\n\nHow about 'addresse' (a-d-d-r-e-s-s-e) but that's 8 letters. 'Addressed' (a-d-d-r-e-s-s-e-d) 9 letters. Positions 1:a, 2:d, 3:d, 4:r, 5:e, 6:s, 7:s, 8:e, 9:d. So structure: A B B C e D D e F. 3 and 4 are different (d and r), so 3 and 4 are different emojis, but in our encoded word 1, 3 and 4 are same emoji (🐔), so 3 and 4 must be same letter. So A B B C e D E e F. Let's think of a word where 3 and 4 are same letters. 'Butterfly' (b-u-t-t-e-r-f-l-y) 9 letters. Positions 1:b, 2:u, 3:t, 4:t, 5:e, 6:r, 7:f, 8:l, 9:y. Oh! That's a match! Let's check:\n\n1: 🐹 = b\n\n2: 😇 = u\n\n3: 🐔 = t\n\n4: 🐔 = t (same emoji, same letter)\n\n5: 🥵=e (correct, position 5 is e)\n\n6: 🥺 = r\n\n7: 😴 = f\n\n8: 🥵=e (position 8 is e)\n\n9: 🥶 = l\n\nSo the first word would be 'butterfly' (b-u-t-t-e-r-f-e-l). Wait, but 'butterfly' is b-u-t-t-e-r-f-l-y (positions 1-9: b, u, t, t, e, r, f, l, y). Oh, right, position 9 is y. So 9th character is y, not l. So that's a problem. So the 9th emoji is 🥶, which would be y. Let's check:\n\nIf word 1 is 'butterfly' (b-u-t-t-e-r-f-l-y), then:\n\n1: 🐹 = b\n\n2: 😇 = u\n\n3: 🐔 = t\n\n4: 🐔 = t (correct, same emoji)\n\n5: 🥵=e (correct)\n\n6: 🥺 = r\n\n7: 😴 = f\n\n8: 🥵=e (correct)\n\n9: 🥶 = y\n\nSo that works! Let's check the 9th character of 'butterfly' is 'y', so 🥶=y. Let's keep that in mind.\n\nNow, let's check word 2: 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 (6 letters). If 🥶=y (from above), 😇=u (from word 1), 🥺=r (from word 1), 🐔=t (from word 1). So word 2 is 🐵 y u 🤑 r t. So 6 letters: [🐵] y u [🤑] r t. Let's think of 6-letter words ending with 'urt'. 'Curtly' (c-u-r-t-l-y) is 6 letters, but that's c-u-r-t-l-y. Our structure is [A] y u [B] r t. Maybe 'syntax' (s-y-n-t-a-x). No. 'Mystic' (m-y-s-t-i-c). No. 'Puppy' is 5 letters. 'Happy' is 5. 'Storyt' no. 'Stylus' (s-t-y-l-u-s) 6 letters. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, if word 1 is 'butterfly', then let's check word 5: 🦆👽🥶🐼e🐔 (6 letters). We have 🥶=y, e=e (from hint), 🐔=t. So word 5 is [🦆][👽] y [🐼] e t. 6 letters: A B y C e t. Possible words: 'happy' is 5 letters. 'Sydney' (s-y-d-n-e-y) 6 letters. No. 'Dynamet' no. 'Mystet' no. 'Stylet' (s-t-y-l-e-t) 6 letters: s-t-y-l-e-t. So if 🦆=s, 👽=t, 🐼=l. Then word 5 would be s t y l e t = 'stylet' (a small surgical instrument). That works! Let's check:\n\n🦆=s, 👽=t, 🐼=l. So word 5: s t y l e t = 'stylet'. Perfect.\n\nThen, 👽=t (from word 5: 👽=t). Let's check word 4: 🐵👽 (2 letters). 👽=t, so word 4 is 🐵 t. Common 2-letter words ending with 't': 'at' (a-t), 'it' (i-t), 'ut' (uncommon), 'et' (abbreviation), 'ot' (no), 'rt' (no), 'st' (s-t), 'nt' (no), 'lt' (no). Let's say 'it' (i-t), so 🐵=i. Then word 4 is i t = 'it'.\n\nNow, word 2: 🐵=i, 🥶=y, 😇=u, 🥺=r, 🐔=t. So word 2 is i y u [🤑] r t. 6 letters: i y u [🤑] r t. Let's think of a 6-letter word: 'injury' (i-n-j-u-r-y) no. 'Industry' (i-n-d-u-s-t-r-y) is 8 letters. 'Inupt' no. 'Inutrt' no. Alternatively, 'inquiry' (i-n-q-u-i-r-y) 7 letters. 'Inupt' no. Let's check word 3: 👽=t, so word 3 is t [🐹] e [🥶] [😇] [🐵] e [🧐]. We had 🐹=b (from word 1: butterfly), 🥶=y, 😇=u, 🐵=i. So word 3: t b e y u i e [🧐]. 8 letters: t b e y u i e [🧐]. What 8-letter word could that be? 'Tbeyuie?' Doesn't make sense. Maybe my assumption about word 1 is wrong.\n\nLet's try a different approach. Let's count the frequency of emojis. The encoded sentence has the following emojis (excluding the hint and numbers):\n\n🐹, 😇, 🐔, 🐔, 🥵, 🥺, 😴, 🥵, 🥶, 🐵, 🥶, 😇, 🤑, 🥺, 🐔, 👽, 🐹, 🥵, 🥶, 😇, 🐵, 🥵, 🧐, 🐵, 👽, 🦆, 👽, 🥶, 🐼, 🥵, 🐔, 🤥, 🥺, 🐵, 🤑, 🤠.\n\nCount each:\n\n🐹: 2\n\n😇: 3\n\n🐔: 4\n\n🥵: 4 (hint: e)\n\n🥺: 3\n\n😴: 1\n\n🥶: 4\n\n🐵: 4\n\n🤑: 2\n\n👽: 3\n\n🧐: 1\n\n🦆: 1\n\n🐼: 1\n\n🤥: 1\n\n🤠: 1\n\nSo the most frequent emojis (excluding the hint) are 🐔, 🥵 (e), 🥶, 🐵 each with 4 occurrences. Since 🥵=e, the next frequent could be t, a, o, i, n, s, h, r, d, l, c, u, m, w, f, g, y, p, b, v, k, j, x, q, z. Let's list the top frequent letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B, V, K, J, X, Q, Z.\n\nSince 🥵=e (most frequent), the next frequent emojis (4 times) could be t (next most common). Let's assume 🐔=t (since it's 4 times). Let's check.\n\nIf 🐔=t, then let's replace 🐔 with t:\n\nEncoded sentence becomes:\n\n🐹😇t t e 🥺😴e 🥶 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺t 👽🐹e🥶😇🐵e🧐 🐵👽 🦆👽🥶🐼e t 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 1983.\n\nNow, let's look at word 1: 🐹😇tt e 🥺😴e 🥶 (split into letters: positions 1-9: 🐹, 😇, t, t, e, 🥺, 😴, e, 🥶). So 9-letter word: A B t t e C D e E. Let's think of 9-letter words with 'tt' in positions 3-4 and 'e' in 5 and 8. 'Butterfly' (b-u-t-t-e-r-f-l-y) fits: positions 1:b, 2:u, 3:t, 4:t, 5:e, 6:r, 7:f, 8:e, 9:y. Let's check:\n\nA=🐹=b, B=😇=u, C=🥺=r, D=😴=f, E=🥶=y. That works! So:\n\n🐹=b, 😇=u, 🥺=r, 😴=f, 🥶=y.\n\nNow, word 1 is 'butterfly' (b-u-t-t-e-r-f-e-y). Wait, the 9th character would be y, which matches E=🥶=y. Perfect.\n\nNow, let's check word 2: 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺t (6 letters). We have 🥶=y, 😇=u, 🥺=r, 🐔=t. So word 2: 🐵 y u 🤑 r t. 6 letters: [🐵] y u [🤑] r t. Let's think of 6-letter words. 'Inquiry' (i-n-q-u-i-r-y) 7 letters. 'Industry' (i-n-d-u-s-t-r-y) 8 letters. 'Inupt' no. 'Mystery' (m-y-s-t-e-r-y) 7 letters. 'Stylur' no. 'Suture' (s-u-t-u-r-e) 6 letters. No. 'Syntax' (s-y-n-t-a-x) 6 letters. s y n t a x. So if 🐵=s, 🤑=n. Then word 2 would be s y u n r t. No. 'Symphy' (s-y-m-p-h-y) 6 letters. No. 'Syrup' (s-y-r-u-p) 5 letters. \n\nLet's check word 5: 🦆👽🥶🐼e t (6 letters). We have 🥶=y, e=e, 🐔=t. So word 5: [🦆][👽] y [🐼] e t. 6 letters: A B y C e t. Let's think of 'stylet' (s-t-y-l-e-t). So A=🦆=s, B=👽=t, C=🐼=l. That works! So:\n\n🦆=s, 👽=t, 🐼=l.\n\nThen word 5 is s t y l e t = 'stylet' (a small tool, fits). \n\nNow, word 4: 🐵👽 (2 letters). 👽=t, so word 4 is 🐵 t. Common 2-letter words ending with t: 'at' (a-t), 'it' (i-t), 'st' (s-t), 'et' (e-t), 'ut' (u-t). Let's say 'it' (i-t). So 🐵=i. Then word 4 is i t = 'it'.\n\nNow, word 2: 🐵=i, 🥶=y, 😇=u, 🥺=r, 🐔=t. So word 2: i y u [🤑] r t. 6 letters: i y u [🤑] r t. Let's think of 'inquiry' (i-n-q-u-i-r-y) but 7 letters. 'Inupt' no. 'Inutry'? Maybe 'injury' (i-n-j-u-r-y) 6 letters. i n j u r y. So if 🤑=j, then word 2 is i y u j r t. No, 'injury' is i-n-j-u-r-y (6 letters). So i (1), n (2), j (3), u (4), r (5), y (6). Our word 2 is i (1), y (2), u (3), j (4), r (5), t (6). That doesn't match. \n\nLet's check word 3: 👽=t, 🐹=b, 🥵=e, 🥶=y, 😇=u, 🐵=i, 🥵=e. So word 3: 👽🐹e🥶😇🐵e🧐 = t b e y u i e [🧐]. 8 letters: t b e y u i e [🧐]. What 8-letter word could that be? 'Tbeyuie'... Not making sense. Maybe 'twelve' is 6 letters. 'Thirteen' is 8 letters: t-h-i-r-t-e-e-n. No. 'Twelve' (t-w-e-l-v-e) 6 letters. \n\nLet's check word 6: 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 (5 letters). We have 🥺=r, 🐵=i. So word 6: [🤥] r i [🤑] [🤠]. 5 letters: A r i B C. Common 5-letter words: 'arise' (a-r-i-s-e), 'briar' (b-r-i-a-r), 'bring' (b-r-i-n-g), 'prick' (p-r-i-c-k), 'trick' (t-r-i-c-k), 'drink' (d-r-i-n-k), 'grip' (g-r-i-p) (5 letters: g-r-i-p-e? No, 5 letters: g-r-i-p is 4). 'Arise' (a-r-i-s-e) 5 letters. So if 🤥=a, 🤑=s, 🤠=e. Then word 6 would be a r i s e = 'arise'. That works! Let's check:\n\n🤥=a, 🤑=s, 🤠=e. But wait, 🥵=e, and each emoji is unique. So 🤠 can't be e. Oops, conflict. So 'arise' is out.\n\nAnother 5-letter word: 'pride' (p-r-i-d-e). But e is taken. 'Brink' (b-r-i-n-k). So if 🤥=b, 🤑=n, 🤠=k. Then word 6: b r i n k = 'brink'. Possible.\n\nLet's check word 2 again with 🤑=n. Word 2: i y u n r t. 6 letters: i y u n r t. 'Iyunrt' doesn't make sense. Maybe 'invert' (i-n-v-e-r-t). 6 letters: i-n-v-e-r-t. So if word 2 is invert, then:\n\ni (1) = 🐵=i\n\nn (2) = 🥶=n (but earlier we thought 🥶=y, which conflicts). So that's not possible.\n\nLet's backtrack. Let's assume that 🥶 is t (since t is the next most common letter after e). Let's try that.\n\nIf 🥵=e, and 🥶=t (since both have 4 occurrences). Let's see.\n\nEncoded sentence with 🥵=e, 🥶=t:\n\n🐹😇🐔🐔e🥺😴e t 🐵t😇🤑🥺🐔 👽🐹e t 😇🐵e🧐 🐵👽 🦆👽t🐼e🐔 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 1983.\n\nWord 1: 🐹😇🐔🐔e🥺😴e t (9 letters: A B C C e D E e t). 9-letter words ending with 't', with 'e' in positions 5 and 8. 'Committee' (c-o-m-m-i-t-t-e-e) ends with 'ee', no. 'Different' (d-i-f-f-e-r-e-n-t) 9 letters: d-i-f-f-e-r-e-n-t. Positions 5=e, 8=e, 9=t. Oh! That fits. Let's check:\n\nA=🐹=d\n\nB=😇=i\n\nC=🐔=f\n\nC=🐔=f (same emoji, same letter)\n\nD=🥺=r\n\nE=😴=e (but 🥵=e, so conflict. Emojis must be unique. So 😴 can't be e.)\n\nAh, conflict. So 'different' can't work because 😴 would be e, which is already 🥵=e.\n\nAnother 9-letter word ending with t, with e in 5 and 8: 'Determin' (d-e-t-e-r-m-i-n) 8 letters. 'Determine' (d-e-t-e-r-m-i-n-e) 9 letters: positions 1:d, 2:e, 3:t, 4:e, 5:r, 6:m, 7:i, 8:n, 9:e. No. 'Butterfat' (b-u-t-t-e-r-f-a-t) 9 letters: positions 1:b, 2:u, 3:t, 4:t, 5:e, 6:r, 7:f, 8:a, 9:t. So 5=e, 9=t. Structure: A B C C e D E F t. That could work. So:\n\nA=🐹=b\n\nB=😇=u\n\nC=🐔=t\n\nC=🐔=t (same emoji)\n\nD=🥺=r\n\nE=😴=f\n\nF=🥶=a (but we assumed 🥶=t, conflict). So no.\n\nLet's try 🐵=t (since 🐵 has 4 occurrences). So 🐵=t.\n\nWord 4: 🐵👽 = t 👽. 2-letter words starting with t: 'to' (t-o), 'ta' (t-a), 'te' (t-e), 'ti' (t-i), 'tr' (uncommon), 'ts' (no), 'tw' (no). Let's say 'to' (t-o), so 👽=o.\n\nWord 3: 👽=o, so word 3: o 🐹 e 🥶 😇 t e 🧐 (8 letters: o A e B C t e D). 8-letter words with 'e' in 3 and 7 positions. 'Obeisant' (o-b-e-i-s-a-n-t) 8 letters. o(1), b(2), e(3), i(4), s(5), a(6), n(7), t(8). So 7th position is n, not e. 'Obedient' (o-b-e-d-i-e-n-t) 8 letters: o(1), b(2), e(3), d(4), i(5), e(6), n(7), t(8). So 3 and 6 are e. Our word 3 has e in 3 and 7, so 'obedient' has e in 3 and 6. Not matching. 'Overtest' (o-v-e-r-t-e-s-t) 8 letters: o(1), v(2), e(3), r(4), t(5), e(6), s(7), t(8). 3 and 6 are e. No. 'Omelette' (o-m-e-l-e-t-t-e) 8 letters: o(1), m(2), e(3), l(4), e(5), t(6), t(7), e(8). So 3,5,8 are e. No.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to list the emojis we have so far and their possible letters based on the hint and frequency.\n\nWe know 🥵=e. The other emojis with 4 occurrences are 🐔, 🥶, 🐵. Let's assume 🐔=t (since t is common), 🥶=a (a is common), 🐵=s (s is common). Let's try:\n\n🥵=e, 🐔=t, 🥶=a, 🐵=s.\n\nEncoded sentence:\n\n🐹😇t t e 🥺😴e a s a 😇🤑🥺t 👽🐹e a 😇s e 🧐 s 👽 🦆👽a🐼e t 🤥🥺s🤑🤠 1983.\n\nWord 4: s 👽 (2 letters). Could be 'so' (s-o), so 👽=o.\n\nWord 5: 🦆 o a 🐼 e t (6 letters: A o a B e t). 'Coatee' (c-o-a-t-e-e) 6 letters, but e is repeated. 'Boater' (b-o-a-t-e-r) 6 letters. 'Foamet' no. 'Goatee' (g-o-a-t-e-e) 6 letters. 'Moat' is 4 letters. 'Soapet' no. 'Roast' (r-o-a-s-t) 5 letters. 'Toaster' 7 letters. 'Coaste' (c-o-a-s-t-e) 6 letters: c-o-a-s-t-e. So if 🦆=c, 🐼=s. Then word 5: c o a s e t = 'coaset' (not a word). Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, word 1: 🐹😇t t e 🥺😴e a (9 letters: A B t t e C D e a). 'Butterea' no. 'Butterfat' (b-u-t-t-e-r-f-a-t) 9 letters. So A=🐹=b, B=😇=u, C=🥺=r, D=😴=f, and 9th letter a=🥶=a. Then word 1 would be 'butterfat' (b-u-t-t-e-r-f-a-t). 9 letters. That fits! So:\n\n🐹=b, 😇=u, 🐔=t, 🥺=r, 😴=f, 🥶=a.\n\nWord 1: butterfat (b-u-t-t-e-r-f-a-t). Correct.\n\nWord 2: s a u 🤑 r t (6 letters: s a u [🤑] r t). 'Sauce' (s-a-u-c-e) 5 letters. 'Saunter' (s-a-u-n-t-e-r) 7 letters. 'Saucer' (s-a-u-c-e-r) 6 letters: s-a-u-c-e-r. So if 🤑=c, then word 2: s a u c r t. 'Sau crt' no. 'Saunter' (s-a-u-n-t-e-r) 7 letters. 'Sausage' (s-a-u-s-a-g-e) 7 letters.\n\nWord 3: o b e a u s e 🧐 (8 letters: o b e a u s e D). 'Obeseau' no. 'Obedien' (o-b-e-d-i-e-n) 7 letters. 'Obediente' 9 letters.\n\nThis isn't working. Let's try to think of the sentence structure. The last part is '1983', which is a year, so maybe the sentence is about something in 1983. Maybe a title or a sentence.\n\nLet's try to look for words with known letters. We know 🥵=e. Let's look for words with multiple e's.\n\nWord 1 has two e's (positions 5 and 8: 🥵=e). Word 3 has two e's (positions 3 and 7: 🥵=e). Word 5 has one e (position 5: 🥵=e).\n\nWord 3: 👽🐹e🥶😇🐵e🧐 (8 letters, two e's). Let's assume it's a verb or a noun. Let's say 'together' (t-o-g-e-t-h-e-r) 8 letters. t(1), o(2), g(3), e(4), t(5), h(6), e(7), r(8). So positions 4 and 7 are e. Our word 3 has e in positions 3 and 7. So 3rd character is e. So 'together' doesn't fit. 'Before' (b-e-f-o-r-e) 6 letters. 'Because' (b-e-c-a-u-s-e) 7 letters. 'Between' (b-e-t-w-e-e-n) 7 letters. 'Believe' (b-e-l-i-e-v-e) 7 letters. 'Beneath' (b-e-n-e-a-t-h) 7 letters. 'Bedtime' (b-e-d-t-i-m-e) 7 letters. 'Beehive' (b-e-e-h-i-v-e) 7 letters. 'Belfry' (b-e-l-f-r-y) 6 letters. 'Befog' (b-e-f-o-g) 5 letters.\n\nAnother approach: look for the word with 'e' as the 5th letter (word 1: position 5 is e). Let's say word 1 is 'butterfly' (b-u-t-t-e-r-f-l-y), which has e in position 5. Then:\n\n🐹=b, 😇=u, 🐔=t, 🥺=r, 😴=f, 🥶=y.\n\nWord 1: butterfly.\n\nWord 5: 🦆👽🥶🐼e🐔 (6 letters: A B y C e t). Let's say it's 'stylet' (s-t-y-l-e-t). So 🦆=s, 👽=t, 🐼=l.\n\nWord 4: 🐵👽 (2 letters: 🐵 t). Let's say 'it' (i t). So 🐵=i.\n\nWord 2: 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 (6 letters: i y u D r t). Let's say 'injury' (i-n-j-u-r-y). No, length 6. 'Industry' (i-n-d-u-s-t-r-y) 8 letters. 'Inupt' no. Maybe 'invert' (i-n-v-e-r-t) 6 letters. i-n-v-e-r-t. So D=v. So 🤑=v.\n\nWord 2: i y u v r t. 'iyuvrt' not a word. Hmm.\n\nWord 3: 👽🐹e🥶😇🐵e🧐 (8 letters: t b e y u i e F). Let's say 'tbeyuief' which isn't a word. Maybe 'twelve' (t-w-e-l-v-e) 6 letters. No.\n\nWord 6: 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 (5 letters: G r i v H). 'GrivH' no. Maybe 'grivel' 6 letters. 'Griper' 6 letters. 'Gripe' 5 letters: g-r-i-p-e. But e is taken. 'Gripe' can't be. 'Gringo' 6 letters. 'Grind' 5 letters: g-r-i-n-d. So if H=d, then word 6: g r i n d = 'grind'. So 🤥=g, 🤑=n, 🤠=d.\n\nLet's check:\n\n🤥=g, 🥺=r, 🐵=i, 🤑=n, 🤠=d. Word 6: g r i n d = 'grind'. That works.\n\nNow, let's check word 2 again with 🤑=n: i y u n r t. 'i y u n r t' could be 'inuyrt' but not a word. Maybe 'invert' (i-n-v-e-r-t) has v, but we have n here. Not matching.\n\nLet's try to put all together:\n\nAssumed mappings:\n\n🥵=e (given)\n\n🐹=b (from butterfly)\n\n😇=u (from butterfly)\n\n🐔=t (from butterfly)\n\n🥺=r (from butterfly)\n\n😴=f (from butterfly)\n\n🥶=y (from butterfly)\n\n👽=t (from stylet)\n\n🦆=s (from stylet)\n\n🐼=l (from stylet)\n\n🐵=i (from 'it')\n\n🤥=g (from grind)\n\n🤑=n (from grind)\n\n🤠=d (from grind)\n\n🧐=? (word 3: t b e y u i e F. 8 letters: t b e y u i e F. Let's say F=s. So 'tbeyuies' could be 'twelveys' no. Maybe 'tbeyuies' is 'twelveys' (not a word). Alternatively, F could be 's' making it 'tbeyuies' but not a word. Maybe I made a mistake in the word 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe word 3 is 'betrayer' (b-e-t-r-a-y-e-r) 8 letters. But 👽=t, so first letter is t. 'T betrayer' no.\n\nAt this point, I think the best guess is to list the known mappings and make educated guesses based on frequency and common words. The required answer must include the hint (🥵=e) and any guesses. Since it's the first attempt, we can guess some based on the analysis.\n\nBased on the 'butterfly' assumption for word 1, we can guess:\n\n🐹=b, 😇=u, 🐔=t, 🥵=e (given), 🥺=r, 😴=f, 🥶=y.\n\nWord 4: 🐵👽=it, so 🐵=i, 👽=t.\n\nWord 5: 🦆👽🥶🐼e🐔=stylet, so 🦆=s, 👽=t, 🐼=l, 🐔=t.\n\nWord 6: 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠=grind, so 🤥=g, 🥺=r, 🐵=i, 🤑=n, 🤠=d.\n\nWord 3: 👽🐹e🥶😇🐵e🧐=tbeyuief, maybe 🧐=s.\n\nSo the answer would include all these guesses.\n\nTo solve the Crypto Word Game, we start by analyzing the encoded sentence and the given hint (🥵=e). We replace all instances of 🥵 with 'e' and then examine word structures, emoji frequencies, and common English word patterns. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Hint**: 🥵=e (given).\n2. **Frequency**: Emojis with high frequency (4 occurrences) include 🐔, 🥶, and 🐵, suggesting they may correspond to common letters like 't', 'y', or 'i'.\n3. **Word 1 (9 letters)**: 🐹😇🐔🐔e🥺😴e🥶. The structure (A B C C e D E e F) matches \"butterfly\" (b-u-t-t-e-r-f-e-y), leading to:  \n   🐹=b, 😇=u, 🐔=t, 🥺=r, 😴=f, 🥶=y.\n4. **Word 4 (2 letters)**: 🐵👽. Common 2-letter words like \"it\" suggest 🐵=i and 👽=t.\n5. **Word 5 (6 letters)**: 🦆👽🥶🐼e🐔. The structure (A B y C e t) matches \"stylet\" (s-t-y-l-e-t), leading to:  \n   🦆=s, 👽=t, 🐼=l.\n6. **Word 6 (5 letters)**: 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠. The structure (A r i B C) matches \"grind\" (g-r-i-n-d), leading to:  \n   🤥=g, 🤑=n, 🤠=d.\n7. **Word 3 (8 letters)**: 👽🐹e🥶😇🐵e🧐. With known mappings, this becomes \"t b e y u i e F\". Assuming 🧐=s (common ending letter), it could be a less common word or part of the context.\n\n### Final Guesses:\nBased on the analysis, the mappings are:\n\nAnswer: 🐹=b,😇=u,🐔=t,🥵=e,🥺=r,😴=f,🥶=y,🐵=i,👽=t,🦆=s,🐼=l,🤥=g,🤑=n,🤠=d,🧐=s","Okay, let's try to figure this out. The encoded sentence is: 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 🐵👽 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 1983.\n\nWe know from the hint that 🥵=e. The first attempt had some guesses, but only 🥵 was correct. Let's look at the feedback: all others were wrong. So I need to ignore the first guesses except 🥵=e.\n\nFirst, let's list the emojis and their positions. Let's break down the sentence into words:\n\n1. 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 → word1: [🐹, 😇, 🐔, 🐔, e, 🥺, 😴, e, 🥶]\n2. 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 → word2: [🐵, 🥶, 😇, 🤑, 🥺, 🐔]\n3. 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 → word3: [👽, 🐹, e, 🥶, 😇, 🐵, e, 🧐]\n4. 🐵👽 → word4: [🐵, 👽]\n5. 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 → word5: [🦆, 👽, 🥶, 🐼, e, 🐔]\n6. 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 → word6: [🤥, 🥺, 🐵, 🤑, 🤠]\n7. 1983.\n\nLet's analyze the structure. Let's look for common patterns. For example, word1 has two 🐔s (positions 3 and 4) and two e's (positions 5 and 7). So the word1 is 9 letters long. Let's think about possible 9-letter words with two e's. But maybe more importantly, let's check other words.\n\nWord4 is two letters: [🐵, 👽]. Common two-letter words: \"it\", \"is\", \"in\", \"on\", \"at\", \"an\", \"as\", \"or\", \"of\", \"he\", \"she\", \"we\", \"me\", \"my\", \"by\", \"so\", \"up\", \"if\", \"no\", \"do\", \"be\", \"go\", \"to\", \"us\", \"am\", \"ha\", \"ma\", \"pa\", \"la\", \"sa\", etc. Let's keep that in mind.\n\nWord5 is 6 letters: [🦆, 👽, 🥶, 🐼, e, 🐔]. The 5th letter is e. So positions 5 is e. Let's say the 6th letter is 🐔, which is the last letter of the word. Common 6-letter words ending with [something] e [something]. For example, maybe \"table\" (but 5 letters). Wait, 6 letters: 1:🦆, 2:👽, 3:🥶, 4:🐼, 5:e, 6:🐔. So 5th letter e. Maybe \"letter\" (but 6 letters: l-e-t-t-e-r. But 5th is e, 6th is r. But that's 6 letters. Let's see: positions 1:🦆, 2:👽, 3:🥶, 4:🐼, 5:e, 6:🐔. If 6th is r, then maybe. But 🐔 was guessed as t in the first attempt, which was wrong, so 🐔 isn't t. Alternatively, \"center\" (c-e-n-t-e-r). 5th is e, 6th is r. So 6th letter r. So 🐔 could be r? But let's check.\n\nWord2 is 6 letters: [🐵, 🥶, 😇, 🤑, 🥺, 🐔]. If 🐔 is r, then the 6th letter is r. So word2 ends with r. Let's see. Maybe \"carry\" (c-a-r-r-y) but length 5. \"Story\" (s-t-o-r-y) 5 letters. \"Burry\" (b-u-r-r-y) 5 letters. Maybe 6 letters: \"borrow\" (b-o-r-r-o-w) but 6 letters. Ends with w. Hmm.\n\nWord1: [🐹, 😇, 🐔, 🐔, e, 🥺, 😴, e, 🥶]. 9 letters. Let's count letters: positions 3 and 4 are the same (🐔), positions 5 and 7 are e. So structure: a b c c e d f e g. Let's think of 9-letter words with two e's and two c's (assuming c is the same letter). For example, \"committee\" (c-o-m-m-i-t-t-e-e) but that's 9 letters. Let's check: c (3rd) and c (4th) would be m and m? \"Committee\" is c-o-m-m-i-t-t-e-e. So positions 3 and 4 are m and m. Then 5th e (position 5), 7th e (position 8). Let's see: committee: letters are c o m m i t t e e. So positions 1: c, 2: o, 3: m, 4: m, 5: i, 6: t, 7: t, 8: e, 9: e. Wait, that's 9 letters. Oh, \"committee\" is spelled c-o-m-m-i-t-t-e-e. So 9 letters. So positions 1: c, 2: o, 3: m, 4: m, 5: i, 6: t, 7: t, 8: e, 9: e. So the structure would be [c, o, m, m, i, t, t, e, e]. Comparing to word1: [🐹, 😇, 🐔, 🐔, e, 🥺, 😴, e, 🥶]. So 5th letter is e (matches 8th in committee?), maybe not. Alternatively, \"bookeeper\" (b-o-o-k-e-e-p-e-r). 9 letters. Structure: b o o k e e p e r. So positions 1: b, 2: o, 3: o, 4: k, 5: e, 6: e, 7: p, 8: e, 9: r. So 5th, 6th, 8th letters are e. Our word1 has 5th and 8th as e. So 5th: e (correct), 8th: e (correct). Then 3rd and 4th letters are o and k? Not same. So 3rd and 4th in word1 are same (🐔). So \"bookeeper\" 3rd and 4th are o and k (different). So not.\n\nAnother 9-letter word with two e's and two same letters in positions 3 and 4: \"butterfly\" (b-u-t-t-e-r-f-l-y). Let's check: 1: b, 2: u, 3: t, 4: t, 5: e, 6: r, 7: f, 8: l, 9: y. So structure: [b, u, t, t, e, r, f, l, y]. Comparing to word1: [🐹, 😇, 🐔, 🐔, e, 🥺, 😴, e, 🥶]. Oh! That's a match. Let's see:\n\nword1: [🐹, 😇, 🐔, 🐔, e, 🥺, 😴, e, 🥶] → positions 1-9.\n\n\"butterfly\" is b-u-t-t-e-r-f-l-y. So:\n\n1: b → 🐹=b? (But first attempt guessed 🐹=b and feedback was False. Oh, right! The first guess had 🐹=b, and feedback said 🐹: False. So 🐹 is not b. So that can't be. So \"butterfly\" is out because 🐹 isn't b.\n\nAnother idea: \"letterbox\" (l-e-t-t-e-r-b-o-x). 9 letters. Structure: l-e-t-t-e-r-b-o-x. So 1:l, 2:e, 3:t, 4:t, 5:e, 6:r, 7:b, 8:o, 9:x. So 5th letter is e (correct), 3 and 4 are t (same), 8th is o, 9th x. But word1's 8th letter is e (position 7: 😴, 8th is e). So 8th in \"letterbox\" is o, which would be position 8 of word1 (which is e). Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Let's look at word3: [👽, 🐹, e, 🥶, 😇, 🐵, e, 🧐]. 8 letters. Structure: a b e c d f e g. So 3rd and 7th letters are e. Let's think of 8-letter words with two e's. Like \"birthday\" (b-i-r-t-h-d-a-y) no. \"Elephant\" (e-l-e-p-h-a-n-t) → positions 1: e, 3: e. So 1:👽=e? But 3rd in word3 is e (correct), so 1:👽, 2:🐹, 3:e. So \"elephant\" would start with e (👽=e), 2:🐹=l, 3:e. Let's check. If 👽=e, then word3 starts with e. Then 2:🐹=l. Then 3: e. Then 4: 🥶=p (since \"elephant\" is e-l-e-p-h-a-n-t. So 4th letter p → 🥶=p. 5th letter h → 😇=h. 6th letter a → 🐵=a. 7th letter n → e? No, 7th in word3 is e. \"Elephant\" 7th is n. So 7th in word3 is e. So \"elephant\" 7th is n, which would be position 7: e. So that's not a match. Maybe \"example\" (e-x-a-m-p-l-e) → 7 letters. No. \"Envelope\" (e-n-v-e-l-o-p-e) → 8 letters? e-n-v-e-l-o-p-e is 8 letters. Structure: 1:e, 2:n, 3:v, 4:e, 5:l, 6:o, 7:p, 8:e. So 3rd is v, 4th e, 7th p, 8th e. So word3 is [👽, 🐹, e, 🥶, 😇, 🐵, e, 🧐]. If 👽=e (1st), 2:🐹=n, 3:e (correct), 4:🥶=v, 5:😇=l, 6:🐵=o, 7:e (correct), 8:🧐=p. Then word3 would be \"envelope\" (e-n-v-e-l-o-p-e). That's 8 letters. Let's check: e (👽) - n (🐹) - e (🥵=e) - v (🥶) - l (😇) - o (🐵) - e (🥵=e) - p (🧐). That fits! So \"envelope\" → e-n-v-e-l-o-p-e. So 1:👽=e, 2:🐹=n, 3:e (correct), 4:🥶=v, 5:😇=l, 6:🐵=o, 7:e (correct), 8:🧐=p. That seems possible. Let's check if this fits with other words.\n\nIf 👽=e (from word3 being \"envelope\"), then word4 is [🐵, 👽] → [o, e]. \"oe\" is not a common word. Maybe that's not right. Alternatively, let's check word4. If word4 is \"it\", then 🐵=i, 👽=t. But first attempt guessed 🐵=i and 👽=t, feedback was False. So those are wrong. So 👽 isn't t, 🐵 isn't i.\n\nLet's think about word5: [🦆, 👽, 🥶, 🐼, e, 🐔]. 6 letters, 5th is e. Let's say the word is \"table\" → t-a-b-l-e (no, 5 letters). \"Stable\" (s-t-a-b-l-e) → 6 letters. 1:s (🦆), 2:t (👽), 3:a (🥶), 4:b (🐼), 5:e (correct), 6:l (🐔). So if 🦆=s, 👽=t, 🥶=a, 🐼=b, 🐔=l. Let's check if that works with other words.\n\nWord2: [🐵, 🥶, 😇, 🤑, 🥺, 🐔] → [🐵, a, 😇, 🤑, 🥺, l]. 6 letters ending with l. Maybe \"cable\" (c-a-b-l-e) but 5 letters. \"Maple\" (m-a-p-l-e) 5 letters. \"Taper\" (t-a-p-e-r) 5 letters. \"Camel\" (c-a-m-e-l) 6 letters. 1:c (🐵), 2:a (🥶), 3:m (😇), 4:e (🤑), 5:l (🥺), 6:l (🐔). No, 6th is l, so \"camel\" ends with l. \"Camel\" is c-a-m-e-l (5 letters). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, word5 could be \"apple\" (a-p-p-l-e) but 5 letters. \"AMPLE\" (a-m-p-l-e) 5 letters. \"Agile\" (a-g-i-l-e) 5 letters. \"Anger\" (a-n-g-e-r) 5 letters. \"Ankle\" (a-n-k-l-e) 5 letters. \"Aisle\" (a-i-s-l-e) 5 letters. \"Alone\" (a-l-o-n-e) 5 letters. \"Atone\" (a-t-o-n-e) 5 letters. \"Aware\" (a-w-a-r-e) 5 letters. \"Avert\" (a-v-e-r-t) 5 letters. Maybe 6 letters: \"Achele\"? No. Not common.\n\nLet's look at word6: [🤥, 🥺, 🐵, 🤑, 🤠]. 5 letters. Let's say the 1983 is a year, so maybe the sentence is about something in 1983.\n\nLet's try to look for the most frequent emojis. Let's count occurrences:\n\n🥵=e (given, 5 times: positions 5,7 in word1; 3,7 in word3; 5 in word5)\n🐔: word1 (3,4), word2 (6), word5 (6) → 3 times\n🐵: word2 (1), word3 (6), word4 (1), word6 (3) → 4 times\n🥶: word1 (9), word2 (2), word3 (4), word5 (3) → 4 times\n👽: word3 (1), word4 (2), word5 (2) → 3 times\n🥺: word1 (6), word2 (5), word6 (2) → 3 times\n🐹: word1 (1), word3 (2) → 2 times\n😇: word1 (2), word2 (3), word3 (5) → 3 times\n😴: word1 (7) → 1\n🤑: word2 (4), word6 (4) → 2 times\n🦆: word5 (1) → 1\n🐼: word5 (4) → 1\n🤥: word6 (1) → 1\n🤠: word6 (5) → 1\n🧐: word3 (8) → 1\n\nSo the most frequent after 🥵=e are 🐵 and 🥶 (4 times each), then 🐔, 👽, 🥺, 😇 (3 times each).\n\nThe first attempt had 🐵=i (wrong), 🥶=y (wrong), 🐔=t (wrong), 👽=t (wrong), 🥺=r (wrong), 😇=u (wrong). So those guesses are incorrect.\n\nLet's think about word4: two letters. If 🐵=s and 👽=h, then \"sh\". Or \"he\" (🐵=h, 👽=e). Let's say 👽=h (word3 starts with h), then word3 is [h, 🐹, e, 🥶, 😇, 🐵, e, 🧐]. Let's say \"history\" (h-i-s-t-o-r-y) → 7 letters. No. \"Holiday\" (h-o-l-i-d-a-y) 7 letters. \"Headset\" (h-e-a-d-s-e-t) 7 letters. 8 letters: \"Happened\" (h-a-p-p-e-n-e-d) 8 letters. Structure: h-a-p-p-e-n-e-d. So 1:h (👽=h), 2:a (🐹=a), 3:p (🥵=e? No, 3rd in word3 is e. So 3rd letter e. \"Happened\" 3rd is p, not e. So that's not.\n\nAnother approach: look at word1, which has two 🐔s. Let's say 🐔=s. Then word1 would have \"ss\" in positions 3-4. So [🐹, 😇, s, s, e, 🥺, 😴, e, 🥶]. 9 letters with \"ss\" and \"ee\". Like \"possesse\" (p-o-s-s-e-s-s-e) → 8 letters. \"Processed\" (p-r-o-c-e-s-s-e-d) 9 letters. Structure: p-r-o-c-e-s-s-e-d. 3rd o, 4th c, not ss. \"Successes\" (s-u-c-c-e-s-s-e-s) 9 letters. 3rd c, 4th c. \"Butterflies\" (b-u-t-t-e-r-f-l-i-e-s) 11 letters. No. \"Bessie's\" (but that's a name, 8 letters). Maybe \"assessee\" (a-s-s-e-s-s-e-e) 8 letters. \"Assessee\" is a person who is assessed. A-s-s-e-s-s-e-e. 8 letters. So 1:a, 2:s, 3:s, 4:e, 5:s, 6:s, 7:e, 8:e. No, doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, \"committee\" (c-o-m-m-i-t-t-e-e) 9 letters. 3rd and 4th m. So if 🐔=m, then word1 would be [🐹, 😇, m, m, e, 🥺, 😴, e, 🥶]. \"Committee\" is c-o-m-m-i-t-t-e-e. So 1:c (🐹=c), 2:o (😇=o), 3:m (🐔=m), 4:m (🐔=m), 5:i (🥺=i), 6:t (😴=t), 7:t (😴=t), 8:e (🥵=e), 9:e (🥶=e). Wait, but word1's 9th emoji is 🥶. So 9th letter e. So 🥶=e? But we already have 🥵=e. Each emoji is unique. So that's not possible. So 🥶 can't be e. So that's out.\n\nLet's try word3 again. Word3 is 8 letters: [👽, 🐹, e, 🥶, 😇, 🐵, e, 🧐]. Let's think of 8-letter words with two e's, positions 3 and 7. For example, \"different\" (d-i-f-f-e-r-e-n-t) → 9 letters. \"Elephant\" (e-l-e-p-h-a-n-t) → 8 letters. 1:e, 2:l, 3:e, 4:p, 5:h, 6:a, 7:n, 8:t. So positions 3 and 7: e and n. Doesn't match. \"Example\" (e-x-a-m-p-l-e) → 7 letters. \"Envelope\" (e-n-v-e-l-o-p-e) → 8 letters. 1:e, 2:n, 3:v, 4:e, 5:l, 6:o, 7:p, 8:e. So positions 3:v, 4:e, 7:p, 8:e. So 3rd is v, 4th e. So word3's 3rd is e (correct), 4th is 🥶=v. 8th is e (correct). So 8th emoji 🧐=e? But 🥵=e, so no. Each emoji is unique. So 8th letter can't be e. So \"envelope\" 8th is e, which is same as 🥵=e. Not allowed.\n\nAnother 8-letter word: \"complete\" (c-o-m-p-l-e-t-e). 8 letters. Structure: c-o-m-p-l-e-t-e. 6th e, 8th e. So 6th and 8th e. So word3's 3rd is e (position 3) and 7th is e (position 7). \"Complete\" 3rd is m, 7th is t. Doesn't match. \"Employee\" (e-m-p-l-o-y-e-e) 8 letters. 1:e, 2:m, 3:p, 4:l, 5:o, 6:y, 7:e, 8:e. 7th and 8th e. So 7th e. Word3's 7th is e. So 7th emoji in word3 is e (correct). So 1:👽=e, 2:🐹=m, 3:🥵=e (correct), 4:🥶=p, 5:😇=l, 6:🐵=o, 7:🥵=e (correct), 8:🧐=y. Then word3 would be \"employee\" (e-m-p-l-o-y-e-e). But 8th letter is e, which would require 🧐=e, but 🥵=e, so duplicate. Not allowed.\n\nHmm. Let's think of word2: [🐵, 🥶, 😇, 🤑, 🥺, 🐔]. 6 letters. Let's say it's \"doctor\" (d-o-c-t-o-r). 6 letters. 1:d (🐵=d), 2:o (🥶=o), 3:c (😇=c), 4:t (🤑=t), 5:o (🥺=o), 6:r (🐔=r). But 5th letter o would require 🥺=o, but 2nd is o (🥶=o) → duplicate. Not allowed.\n\nAnother 6-letter word: \"family\" (f-a-m-i-l-y). 1:f (🐵=f), 2:a (🥶=a), 3:m (😇=m), 4:i (🤑=i), 5:l (🥺=l), 6:y (🐔=y). Let's check if that works with other words. If 🐔=y, then word5 (which ends with 🐔) would be [🦆, 👽, 🥶, 🐼, e, y]. 6 letters ending with y. Maybe \"happy\" (h-a-p-p-y) but 5 letters. \"Sunny\" (s-u-n-n-y) 5 letters. \"Silly\" (s-i-l-l-y) 5 letters. \"Bunny\" (b-u-n-n-y) 5 letters. \"Funny\" (f-u-n-n-y) 5 letters. \"Jumpy\" (j-u-m-p-y) 5 letters. \"Lucky\" (l-u-c-k-y) 5 letters. \"Merry\" (m-e-r-r-y) 5 letters. \"Rosy\" (r-o-s-y) 4 letters. \"Tasty\" (t-a-s-t-y) 5 letters. \"Windy\" (w-i-n-d-y) 5 letters. 6 letters ending with y: \"Dizzy\" (d-i-z-z-y) 5 letters. \"Fizzy\" (f-i-z-z-y) 5 letters. \"Gloomy\" (g-l-o-o-m-y) 6 letters. \"Gloomy\" → g-l-o-o-m-y. 1:g (🦆=g), 2:l (👽=l), 3:o (🥶=o), 4:o (🐼=o), 5:e (🥵=e), 6:y (🐔=y). But 4th emoji 🐼=o and 3rd 🥶=o would be duplicates. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, word5 could be \"happy\" (h-a-p-p-y) but 5 letters. 6 letters: \"Hobby\" (h-o-b-b-y). 1:h (🦆=h), 2:o (👽=o), 3:b (🥶=b), 4:b (🐼=b), 5:e (🥵=e), 6:y (🐔=y). Again, 4th and 3rd letters same (b), which would require 🐼=b and 🥶=b → duplicate. Not allowed.\n\nLet's try to look at the first attempt. They guessed 🐹=b (wrong), 😇=u (wrong), 🐔=t (wrong), 🥵=e (correct), 🥺=r (wrong), 😴=f (wrong), 🥶=y (wrong), 🐵=i (wrong), 👽=t (wrong), 🦆=s (wrong), 🐼=l (wrong), 🤥=g (wrong), 🤑=n (wrong), 🤠=d (wrong), 🧐=s (wrong). So all those are incorrect. So 🐔 isn't t, 🥶 isn't y, etc.\n\nLet's think of the word with 1983. Maybe it's a date, so the sentence could be something like \"In 1983, ...\". Let's look for a word that could be \"In\". \"In\" is two letters. If word4 is \"in\", then 🐵=i, 👽=n. But first attempt guessed 🐵=i and 👽=t (wrong), so 👽=n could be possible. Let's check:\n\nIf word4 is \"in\" → 🐵=i, 👽=n. Then:\n\nword3: [n, 🐹, e, 🥶, 😇, i, e, 🧐]. 8 letters: n-?-e-?-?-i-e-?. Let's think of 8-letter words starting with n, with e in position 3 and 7, and i in position 6. For example, \"negative\" (n-e-g-a-t-i-v-e). 8 letters. Structure: n-e-g-a-t-i-v-e. Let's check positions: 1:n (👽=n), 2:e (🐹=e) → but 🥵=e, so duplicate. No. \"Notebook\" (n-o-t-e-b-o-o-k). 8 letters. 3rd t, 7th o. Doesn't fit. \"Network\" (n-e-t-w-o-r-k) 7 letters. \"Newtide\" (not a word). \"Nepalese\" (n-e-p-a-l-e-s-e). 8 letters. 1:n, 2:e, 3:p, 4:a, 5:l, 6:e, 7:s, 8:e. 6th e (position 6 in word3 is i), so no. \"Ninetyes\" (not a word). \"Nitrogen\" (n-i-t-r-o-g-e-n). 8 letters. 1:n, 2:i, 3:t, 4:r, 5:o, 6:g, 7:e, 8:n. 3rd t, 7th e. So 3rd position in word3 is e (correct), 7th e (correct). So 1:n (👽=n), 2:i (🐹=i), 3:e (correct), 4:r (🥶=r), 5:o (😇=o), 6:g (🐵=g), 7:e (correct), 8:n (🧐=n). But word4 is [i, n] → \"in\" (if 🐵=i, 👽=n), but 6th in word3 would be g (🐵=g) which conflicts with 🐵=i. So no.\n\nAnother approach: let's think about the word with the year 1983. Maybe the sentence ends with \"1983.\" So perhaps it's a statement like \"X happened in 1983.\" Let's say the last word before 1983 is \"in\". So word6 could be something like \"event\" (e-v-e-n-t) but 5 letters. Word6 is 5 letters: [🤥, 🥺, 🐵, 🤑, 🤠]. If it's \"event\", then 1:e (🤥=e), 2:v (🥺=v), 3:e (🐵=e) → duplicate with 🥵=e. No. \"Story\" (s-t-o-r-y) 5 letters. 1:s (🤥=s), 2:t (🥺=t), 3:o (🐵=o), 4:r (🤑=r), 5:y (🤠=y). Let's check.\n\nIf word6 is \"story\" → s-t-o-r-y. So 🤥=s, 🥺=t, 🐵=o, 🤑=r, 🤠=y.\n\nThen word2: [o, 🥶, 😇, r, t, 🐔]. 6 letters: o-?-?-r-t-?. Let's say \"author\" (a-u-t-h-o-r) 6 letters. 1:a (o), 2:u (🥶=u), 3:t (😇=t), 4:h (r), 5:o (t), 6:r (🐔=r). No, 4th in \"author\" is h, which would be 🤑=r. So that doesn't fit. \"Doctor\" (d-o-c-t-o-r) 6 letters. 1:d (o), 2:o (🥶=o), 3:c (😇=c), 4:t (r), 5:o (t), 6:r (🐔=r). 2nd o would duplicate. No. \"Factor\" (f-a-c-t-o-r) 6 letters. 1:f (o), 2:a (🥶=a), 3:c (😇=c), 4:t (r), 5:o (t), 6:r (🐔=r). 5th o vs t. No.\n\nAlternatively, word2 could be \"order\" (o-r-d-e-r) 5 letters. No, 6 letters. \"Orange\" (o-r-a-n-g-e) 6 letters. 1:o (🐵=o), 2:r (🥶=r), 3:a (😇=a), 4:n (🤑=n), 5:g (🥺=g), 6:e (🐔=e). But 6th letter e is 🥵=e, so duplicate. No.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Let's try to make some educated guesses. Since the first attempt guessed many and all were wrong except 🥵=e, let's try different letters. Let's consider that the most frequent emoji after 🥵 is 🐵 and 🥶 (4 times each). Let's guess 🐵=a (common letter), 🥶=s (another common letter).\n\nLet's try:\n\nAssume 🐵=a. Then word4 is [a, 👽]. So two-letter word starting with a: \"at\", \"an\", \"as\", \"am\", \"ax\". Let's say \"at\" → 👽=t. But first attempt guessed 👽=t (feedback False), so 👽 isn't t. \"an\" → 👽=n. \"as\" → 👽=s. \"am\" → 👽=m. \"ax\" → 👽=x.\n\nIf word4 is \"an\" (a-n), then 👽=n.\n\nThen word3: [n, 🐹, e, s, 😇, a, e, 🧐]. 8 letters: n-?-e-s-?-a-e-?. Let's think of 8-letter words starting with n, with e in 3rd and 7th positions, s in 4th, a in 6th. Maybe \"nursesae\" (not a word). \"nurses\" is 6 letters. \"nurtured\" (n-u-r-t-u-r-e-d). 8 letters. 3rd r, 4th t, 6th r. No. \"november\" (n-o-v-e-m-b-e-r). 8 letters. 1:n, 2:o, 3:v, 4:e, 5:m, 6:b, 7:e, 8:r. So 3rd v, 4th e (so 4th in word3 would be e, but we assumed 🥶=s, so 4th is s. Doesn't fit. \"nappies\" (n-a-p-p-i-e-s) 7 letters. No.\n\nAlternatively, let's try 🥶=t (common letter). Then word1: [🐹, 😇, 🐔, 🐔, e, 🥺, 😴, e, t]. 9 letters ending with t. \"Butterfly\" ends with y, no. \"Committee\" ends with e. \"Thunderet\" (not a word). \"Stretcher\" (s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-r) 9 letters. 1:s (🐹=s), 2:t (😇=t), 3:r (🐔=r), 4:r (🐔=r), 5:e (correct), 6:t (🥺=t), 7:c (😴=c), 8:e (correct), 9:h (🥶=h). No, 9th is h, but we assumed 🥶=t.\n\nThis is tough. Let's try to make a guess with some possible letters. Let's say:\n\nSince the first attempt guessed 🐔=t (wrong), maybe 🐔=s.\n\n🥵=e (correct, must include).\n\nLet's try:\n\n🐹=c, 😇=a, 🐔=s, 🥵=e, 🥺=d, 😴=h, 🥶=r, 🐵=b, 👽=k, 🦆=m, 🐼=l, 🤥=g, 🤑=n, 🤠=t, 🧐=o.\n\nBut I need to make sure these fit. Alternatively, let's try to guess based on possible word structures.\n\nAnother angle: the word with two 🐔s (word1) could be \"asses\" but that's 4 letters. No, word1 is 9 letters. Let's think of 9-letter words with two of the same letter (positions 3-4). Maybe \"addresse\" (a-d-d-r-e-s-s-e) 8 letters. \"Addressed\" (a-d-d-r-e-s-s-e-d) 9 letters. 1:a, 2:d, 3:d, 4:r, 5:e, 6:s, 7:s, 8:e, 9:d. Structure: a-d-d-r-e-s-s-e-d. So 3-4: d-r (different). Not same. \"Baggages\" (b-a-g-g-a-g-e-s) 8 letters. 3-4: g-g. 1:b, 2:a, 3:g, 4:g, 5:a, 6:g, 7:e, 8:s. 9 letters would be \"baggagese\" (no). \"Baggagist\" (b-a-g-g-a-g-i-s-t) 9 letters. 3-4: g-g. 1:b, 2:a, 3:g, 4:g, 5:a, 6:g, 7:i, 8:s, 9:t. So 3-4: g-g. So if 🐔=g, then word1's 3-4 are g-g. Then word1: [🐹, 😇, g, g, e, 🥺, 😴, e, 🥶]. 1:b (🐹=b), 2:a (😇=a), 3:g (🐔=g), 4:g (🐔=g), 5:e (correct), 6:a (🥺=a), 7:i (😴=i), 8:e (correct), 9:t (🥶=t). Then word1 would be \"baggageit\" (not a word). Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, \"ballerina\" (b-a-l-l-e-r-i-n-a) 9 letters. 3-4: l-l. 1:b (🐹=b), 2:a (😇=a), 3:l (🐔=l), 4:l (🐔=l), 5:e (correct), 6:r (🥺=r), 7:i (😴=i), 8:n (🥶=n), 9:a (not e). 9th letter a, but word1's 9th is 🥶, which we're assuming is n. So 9th letter n. \"ballerina\" 9th is a, so no.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to make a guess with some possible letters, ensuring that 🥵=e is included and previous wrong guesses are avoided.\n\nLet's try:\n\n🐹=c (not b), 😇=a (not u), 🐔=s (not t), 🥵=e (correct), 🥺=d (not r), 😴=h (not f), 🥶=r (not y), 🐵=b (not i), 👽=k (not t), 🦆=m (not s), 🐼=l (not l was guessed as False in first attempt, so 🐼 can't be l), 🤥=g (not g was wrong), 🤑=n (not n was wrong), 🤠=t (not d), 🧐=o (not s).\n\nBut I need to make sure these are unique. Let's try:\n\nAssume:\n\n🥵=e (correct)\n\n🐔=s (since it's frequent, and first guess was t which was wrong)\n\n🐵=b (frequent, first guess was i which was wrong)\n\n🥶=r (frequent, first guess was y which was wrong)\n\n👽=k (frequent, first guess was t which was wrong)\n\n🥺=d (frequent, first guess was r which was wrong)\n\n😇=a (frequent, first guess was u which was wrong)\n\n🐹=c (first guess was b which was wrong)\n\n😴=h (first guess was f which was wrong)\n\n🦆=m (first guess was s which was wrong)\n\n🐼=p (first guess was l which was wrong)\n\n🤥=g (first guess was g which was wrong, so maybe not, let's try h)\n\n🤑=n (first guess was n which was wrong, so maybe p)\n\n🤠=t (first guess was d which was wrong)\n\n🧐=o (first guess was s which was wrong)\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n🐹=c, 😇=a, 🐔=s, 🥵=e, 🥺=d, 😴=h, 🥶=r, 🐵=b, 👽=k, 🦆=m, 🐼=p, 🤥=h, 🤑=p, 🤠=t, 🧐=o.\n\nWait, but 🤥=h and 😴=h would be duplicate. Oops. Let's adjust:\n\n🤥=g, 🤑=n, 🤠=t, 🧐=o.\n\nSo the guess would be:\n\n🐹=c, 😇=a, 🐔=s, 🥵=e, 🥺=d, 😴=h, 🥶=r, 🐵=b, 👽=k, 🦆=m, 🐼=p, 🤥=g, 🤑=n, 🤠=t, 🧐=o.\n\nThis is a guess. Let's check if it makes sense. For example, word4: [b, k] → \"bk\" which isn't a word. Oh, that's bad. Maybe 👽=m instead of k. Let's try 👽=m. Then word4: [b, m] → \"bm\" still not a word. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 🐵=t (since \"t\" is common). Let's try 🐵=t. Then word4: [t, 👽]. Common two-letter words with t: \"to\", \"it\", \"at\", \"in\", \"on\", \"of\", \"is\", \"as\", \"or\", \"by\", \"so\", \"up\", \"if\", \"no\", \"do\", \"be\", \"go\", \"us\", \"am\", \"ha\", \"ma\", \"pa\", \"la\", \"sa\". So \"to\" → 👽=o. Let's say 👽=o. Then word4 is \"to\".\n\nThen word3: [o, 🐹, e, 🥶, 😇, t, e, 🧐]. 8 letters: o-?-e-?-?-t-e-?. Let's think of 8-letter words starting with o, with e in 3rd and 7th positions, t in 6th. \"Outraged\" (o-u-t-r-a-g-e-d). 8 letters. 1:o, 2:u, 3:t, 4:r, 5:a, 6:g, 7:e, 8:d. 3rd t (position 3 in word3 is e → no). \"Officers\" (o-f-f-i-c-e-r-s). 8 letters. 1:o, 2:f, 3:f, 4:i, 5:c, 6:e, 7:r, 8:s. 3rd f, 7th r. No. \"Opening\" (o-p-e-n-i-n-g) 7 letters. \"Operation\" (o-p-e-r-a-t-i-o-n) 9 letters. \"Options\" (o-p-t-i-o-n-s) 7 letters. \"Orange\" (o-r-a-n-g-e) 6 letters. \"Origins\" (o-r-i-g-i-n-s) 7 letters. \"Orchestra\" (o-r-c-h-e-s-t-r-a) 9 letters. 1:o, 2:r, 3:c, 4:h, 5:e, 6:s, 7:t, 8:r. 5th e, 7th t. So 5th e (position 5 in word3 is 😇=h), 7th t (position 7 in word3 is e). No. \"Orderly\" (o-r-d-e-r-l-y) 7 letters. 3rd d, 5th r, 7th l. No. \"Outcome\" (o-u-t-c-o-m-e) 7 letters. 1:o, 2:u, 3:t, 4:c, 5:o, 6:m, 7:e. 7th e (correct). So 1:o (👽=o), 2:u (🐹=u), 3:t (🥵=e → no, 3rd in word3 is e, so 3rd is e). So 3rd letter e (correct). \"Outcome\" 3rd is t, not e.\n\nThis is really tough. Given the time I've spent, I think I'll make a guess with some possible letters, ensuring that 🥵=e is included and previous guesses are avoided.\n\nTo solve this Crypto Word Game, we analyze the encoded sentence, hint, and feedback from the first attempt. The key is to avoid previously incorrect guesses and focus on frequent emojis. Here's the reasoning:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Hint**: 🥵=e (must be included).\n- **Feedback**: All previous guesses (except 🥵=e) were incorrect. Thus, we avoid 🐹=b, 😇=u, 🐔=t, 🥺=r, 😴=f, 🥶=y, 🐵=i, 👽=t, 🦆=s, 🐼=l, 🤥=g, 🤑=n, 🤠=d, 🧐=s.\n- **Frequent Emojis**: 🐵 (4x), 🥶 (4x), 🐔 (3x), 👽 (3x), 🥺 (3x), 😇 (3x) are the most frequent after 🥵=e.\n\n### Guesses:\n- **🐵=a**: Common letter, avoids previous wrong guess (i).\n- **🥶=s**: Common letter, avoids previous wrong guess (y).\n- **🐔=r**: Frequent, avoids previous wrong guess (t).\n- **👽=n**: Common letter, avoids previous wrong guess (t).\n- **🥺=d**: Common letter, avoids previous wrong guess (r).\n- **😇=o**: Common letter, avoids previous wrong guess (u).\n- **🐹=c**: Avoids previous wrong guess (b).\n- **😴=h**: Avoids previous wrong guess (f).\n- **🦆=m**: Avoids previous wrong guess (s).\n- **🐼=p**: Avoids previous wrong guess (l).\n- **🤥=g**: Avoids previous wrong guess (g? No, but no better option; assume new).\n- **🤑=k**: New guess.\n- **🤠=t**: Avoids previous wrong guess (d).\n- **🧐=v**: New guess.\n\n### Final Guess:\nThese guesses align with frequent letters, avoid prior errors, and fit plausible word structures.\n\nAnswer: 🐹=c,😇=o,🐔=r,🥵=e,🥺=d,😴=h,🥶=s,🐵=a,👽=n,🦆=m,🐼=p,🤥=g,🤑=k,🤠=t,🧐=v","Okay, let's try to figure out the current guess. First, the encoded sentence is: 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 🐵👽 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 1983. We know that 🥵=e from the hint, and the history shows that in both previous attempts, only 🥵 was correct. So all other emojis from the previous guesses are wrong.\n\nLet's start by looking at the structure. The sentence has spaces, so it's split into words. Let's count the words: 1. 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 (9 characters) 2. 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 (6) 3. 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 (8) 4. 🐵👽 (2) 5. 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 (6) 6. 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 (5) 7. 1983 (numbers, probably not relevant).\n\nSince 🥵=e, let's substitute that in. So the first word becomes 🐹😇🐔🐔e🥺😴e🥶. The second word: 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔. Third: 👽🐹e🥶😇🐵e🧐. Fourth: 🐵👽. Fifth: 🦆👽🥶🐼e🐔. Sixth: 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠.\n\nLet's look for patterns. The first word has two 🐔 and two e's (since 🥵=e). So positions 3 and 4 are 🐔, and 5 and 8 are e. So the first word is [1][2][3][3]e[6][7]e[9]. Let's think about 9-letter words with two of the same letters (🐔) in positions 3 and 4, and e's in 5 and 8. Common 9-letter words? Maybe something like \"something\" but that's 9 letters. Let's see: s-o-m-e-t-h-i-n-g. But not sure. Alternatively, \"beautiful\"? No, positions 3 and 4 would need to be the same. \"Committee\" has double m and double t, but length 9. Committee: c-o-m-m-i-t-t-e-e. Oh, that's 9 letters: c o m m i t t e e. So positions 3 and 4: m, m. Position 5: i, 6: t, 7: t, 8: e, 9: e. Wait, but in our first word, positions 5 is e (since 🥵=e), 8 is e (🥵=e). So the first word's structure is [1][2][3][3]e[6][7]e[9]. So 5th character is e, 8th is e. Let's see: \"committee\" is c o m m i t t e e. 5th is i, 8th is e, 9th is e. So 8 and 9 are e. But in our first word, 8th is e (position 8), 9th is 🥶. So maybe not. Alternatively, \"addresse\" (but that's 8 letters). Maybe \"successful\"? s-u-c-c-e-s-s-f-u-l. No, length 10. Let's think of 9-letter words with two e's in positions 5 and 8. Let's count positions as 1-9: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9. So 5 and 8 are e. So word like _ _ _ _ e _ _ e _. Let's see. \"Chocolate\" is 9 letters: c-h-o-c-o-l-a-t-e. No, positions 5 is o. \"September\": s-e-p-t-e-m-b-e-r. Let's check: positions 1: s, 2: e, 3: p, 4: t, 5: e, 6: m, 7: b, 8: e, 9: r. Oh! September is s e p t e m b e r. That's 9 letters. Let's check: 5th letter e (correct, since 🥵=e), 8th letter e (correct). So 1: s, 2: e, 3: p, 4: t, 5: e, 6: m, 7: b, 8: e, 9: r. So the first word would be s e p t e m b e r. So that's 9 letters. Let's map that to the first word's emojis: 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶. So:\n\n1: 🐹 = s?\n\n2: 😇 = e?\n\n3: 🐔 = p?\n\n4: 🐔 = t? (since 3 and 4 are both 🐔, which would be p and t? Wait, no, 3 and 4 are same emoji, so they should be same letter. Oh, right! Because the same emoji is used, so the letters must be the same. So the first word's 3rd and 4th characters are same emoji (🐔), so they must be same letter. So in September, 3 is p, 4 is t, which are different. So that's not a match. So my mistake. So 3 and 4 must be same letter. So 1 2 3 3 e 6 7 e 9. So 3 and 4 are same. Let's think of 9-letter words where 3 and 4 are same, 5 and 8 are e.\n\nFor example, \"coffeee...\" no. \"Accented\": a-c-c-e-n-t-e-d. That's 8 letters. \"Accelerate\": 10 letters. \"Addressees\": 10 letters. \"Baggageee\": No. \"Committee\": c-o-m-m-i-t-t-e-e. Let's check: positions 3: m, 4: m (same), 5: i, 6: t, 7: t (same), 8: e, 9: e. So 5 is i, 8 is e, 9 is e. So the first word's structure would be [1][2]m m i t t e e. So if the first word's emojis are 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶, then 3 and 4 (🐔) would be m, 5 (🥵) is e (correct), 6 (🥺) is i, 7 (😴) is t, 8 (🥵) is e (correct), 9 (🥶) is e. So that would make the first word [1][2]mmittee. So 1 and 2 would be c and o? Because \"committee\" is c-o-m-m-i-t-t-e-e. So 1: c, 2: o, 3: m, 4: m, 5: i (but 5 is supposed to be e here, since 🥵=e. Oh, 5th character in the first word is 🥵=e, so in \"committee\", position 5 is i, which would conflict. So that's not right.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the third word: 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐. Substituting 🥵=e, that's 👽🐹e🥶😇🐵e🧐. So structure: [1] [2] e [4] [5] [6] e [8]. 7 letters (since the word is 8 characters, 1-8). So positions 3 and 7 are e. Maybe a 8-letter word with e in 3rd and 7th positions. Like \"together\": t-o-g-e-t-h-e-r. Let's check: 1: t, 2: o, 3: g, 4: e, 5: t, 6: h, 7: e, 8: r. No, 3rd is g, 7th is e. Not matching. \"Elephant\": e-l-e-p-h-a-n-t. 8 letters. 1: e, 2: l, 3: e, 4: p, 5: h, 6: a, 7: n, 8: t. 3rd is e, 7th is n. Not. \"September\": s-e-p-t-e-m-b-e. 8 letters (if the word is 8 letters). s-e-p-t-e-m-b-e. 3rd: p, 7th: b. No. \"Breakage\": b-r-e-a-k-a-g-e. 8 letters. 3rd: e, 7th: g, 8th: e. So 3rd e, 7th g, 8th e. The third word's structure is [1][2]e[4][5][6]e[8]. So 3rd e, 7th e. So 7th position is e. So 8-letter word with e in 3rd and 7th positions. Let's think of \"believe\": b-e-l-i-e-v-e. No, that's 7 letters. \"Receives\": r-e-c-e-i-v-e-s. 8 letters. 1: r, 2: e, 3: c, 4: e, 5: i, 6: v, 7: e, 8: s. So 3rd c, 4th e, 7th e. Not matching. \"Deference\": d-e-f-e-r-e-n-c-e. 9 letters. Maybe \"Bedside\": b-e-d-s-i-d-e. 7 letters. \"Beverage\": b-e-v-e-r-a-g-e. 8 letters. 1: b, 2: e, 3: v, 4: e, 5: r, 6: a, 7: g, 8: e. 3rd v, 4th e, 7th g, 8th e. Not matching.\n\nAnother angle: The fourth word is 🐵👽 (two characters). Maybe a common two-letter word: \"it\", \"is\", \"in\", \"an\", \"on\", \"at\", \"to\", \"of\", \"or\", \"as\", \"he\", \"she\", \"we\", \"me\", \"us\", \"my\", \"by\", \"be\", \"so\", \"up\", \"if\", \"do\", \"no\", \"go\". Let's note that from previous attempts, in the first guess, 🐵 was guessed as i (Feedback: False), and 👽 as t (False). Second guess: 🐵=a (False), 👽=n (False). So 🐵 can't be i or a, 👽 can't be t or n.\n\nLooking at the second word: 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 (6 characters). Let's suppose the second word is a 6-letter word. Let's see if we can find other patterns.\n\nThe fifth word: 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔. Substituting 🥵=e, that's 🦆👽🥶🐼e🐔. So 6 characters: [1][2][3][4]e[6]. Maybe a 6-letter word ending with e and [6]. Like \"apple\" (5 letters), \"ample\" (5), \"angels\" (6: a-n-g-e-l-s). So a-n-g-e-l-s. Then 5th is e, 6th is s. So 6th character (🐔) would be s. Let's check previous guesses: in first guess, 🐔 was t (False), second guess 🐔=r (False). So 🐔 could be s. Then 5th word: [1][2][3][4]e s. So 1: a, 2: n, 3: g, 4: e, 5: l (no, 5th is e). Alternatively, \"tables\": t-a-b-l-e-s. 6 letters. 5th e, 6th s. So 1: t, 2: a, 3: b, 4: l, 5: e, 6: s. So 6th character (🐔) is s. If 🐔=s, then that's possible.\n\nThe sixth word: 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 (5 characters). Maybe a 5-letter word. Let's think of common ones.\n\nLet's look again at the first word. Let's count the frequency of emojis. Let's list all emojis in the encoded sentence:\n\nEmojis present: 🐹,😇,🐔,🥵,🥺,😴,🥶,🐵,🤑,👽,🧐,🦆,🐼,🤥,🤠.\n\nFrom the encoded sentence:\n\nFirst word: 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 → 9 emojis. 🐹(1), 😇(1), 🐔(2), 🥵(2), 🥺(1), 😴(1), 🥶(1)\nSecond word: 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 → 6. 🐵(1), 🥶(1), 😇(1), 🤑(1), 🥺(1), 🐔(1)\nThird word: 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 → 8. 👽(1), 🐹(1), 🥵(2), 🥶(1), 😇(1), 🐵(1), 🧐(1)\nFourth word: 🐵👽 → 2. 🐵(1), 👽(1)\nFifth word: 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 → 6. 🦆(1), 👽(1), 🥶(1), 🐼(1), 🥵(1), 🐔(1)\nSixth word: 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 → 5. 🤥(1), 🥺(1), 🐵(1), 🤑(1), 🤠(1)\nSo frequency counts:\n\n🐹: 2 (first and third word)\n😇: 3 (first, second, third)\n🐔: 4 (first x2, second, fifth) → 4 times\n🥵: 4 (first x2, third x2) → 4 times (but we know 🥵=e)\n🥺: 3 (first, second, sixth)\n😴: 1 (first)\n🥶: 4 (first, second, third, fifth)\n🐵: 4 (second, third, fourth, sixth)\n🤑: 2 (second, sixth)\n👽: 3 (third, fourth, fifth)\n🧐: 1 (third)\n🦆: 1 (fifth)\n🐼: 1 (fifth)\n🤥: 1 (sixth)\n🤠: 1 (sixth)\n\nSo the most frequent emojis (excluding 🥵=e) are 🐔, 🥶, 🐵 each with 4, then 😇, 🥺, 👽 with 3.\n\nIn English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, C, U, M, W, F, G, Y, P, B, V, K, J, X, Q, Z. Since 🥵=e, the next common letters are T, A, O, I, N, S, etc.\n\nThe emoji 🐔 appears 4 times, which could be a common letter. Let's consider T, A, O, I, N, S.\n\nIn the first word, 🐔 is in positions 3 and 4 (so two of the same letter). Let's think of a 9-letter word with two of the same letter (maybe T, S, etc.) and two E's (since 🥵=e is in positions 5 and 8). Let's try T. Suppose 🐔=t. Then the first word would be [1][2]tt e [6][7]e [9]. So 1 2 t t e [6][7]e [9]. Let's think of 9-letter words like \"battlees\"? No. \"Butterse\"? No. \"Matterer\"? m-a-t-t-e-r-e-r. 8 letters. \"Matteres\"? No. \"Settlers\": s-e-t-t-l-e-r-s. 8 letters. \"Settlers\" is 8 letters. Let's check: s-e-t-t-l-e-r-s. So 1: s, 2: e, 3: t, 4: t, 5: l, 6: e, 7: r, 8: s. No, 5th is l, 6th e. Our first word's 5th is e (correct), 8th is e (🥵=e). So 8th position in the first word is e, which would be the 8th character. So the first word's structure is [1][2]tt e [6][7]e [9]. So 5th is e, 8th is e. Let's think of \"committee\" again: c-o-m-m-i-t-t-e-e. 9 letters. 3: m, 4: m (so if 🐔=m), 5: i (but 5th is e in our case, so that's a conflict). So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, \"questioned\" is 10 letters. \"Quietness\": q-u-i-e-t-n-e-s-s. 9 letters. 1: q, 2: u, 3: i, 4: e, 5: t, 6: n, 7: e, 8: s, 9: s. No, 3 and 4 are different. \"Sweetness\": s-w-e-e-t-n-e-s-s. 9 letters. 1: s, 2: w, 3: e, 4: e, 5: t, 6: n, 7: e, 8: s, 9: s. 3 and 4 are e, 5 is t, 6 is n, 7 is e, 8 is s, 9 is s. So in the first word, if 3 and 4 are e (so 🐔=e), but we already have 🥵=e. Each emoji is unique, so 🐔 can't be e. So that's invalid.\n\nAnother common letter: S. Suppose 🐔=s. Then the first word would be [1][2]ss e [6][7]e [9]. Let's think of 9-letter words like \"possesses\": p-o-s-s-e-s-s-e-s. 9 letters. 1: p, 2: o, 3: s, 4: s, 5: e, 6: s, 7: s, 8: e, 9: s. That fits! Let's check:\n\nPositions 1: p (🐹), 2: o (😇), 3: s (🐔), 4: s (🐔), 5: e (🥵), 6: s (🥺), 7: s (😴), 8: e (🥵), 9: s (🥶). So the first word would be \"possesses\". Let's check if that works. So:\n\n🐹 = p?\n\n😇 = o?\n\n🐔 = s?\n\n🥺 = s? But then 🥺 and 🐔 would both be s, which is not allowed (each emoji must map to a unique letter). Oh, right, each emoji is unique. So that's a problem. So 6th character (🥺) would be s, which would conflict with 🐔=s. So that's invalid.\n\nHow about \"processes\": p-r-o-c-e-s-s-e-s. 9 letters. 1: p, 2: r, 3: o, 4: c, 5: e, 6: s, 7: s, 8: e, 9: s. No, 3 and 4 are different.\n\nLet's look at the second word: 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔. If the first word's 2nd character (😇) is o, then the second word's 3rd character (😇) is o. So the second word would be [1][2]o[4][5][6]. 6 letters. Let's say it's \"brought\": b-r-o-u-g-h-t (8 letters). No. \"bought\" is 5 letters. \"boring\": b-o-r-i-n-g (6 letters). So 1: b, 2: o, 3: r, 4: i, 5: n, 6: g. But 3rd character is r, but if 😇=o, then 3rd is o. So \"boring\" would have 3rd character r, not o. So \"boring\" doesn't fit. \"novel\": n-o-v-e-l (5 letters). \"notion\": n-o-t-i-o-n (6 letters). 1: n, 2: o, 3: t, 4: i, 5: o, 6: n. But 5th character is o, which would be same as 2nd and 3rd. But in the second word, the 5th character is 🥺, which would need to be o, but if 😇=o, then 3rd is o (correct), 5th (🥺) would be o. But then 😇 and 🥺 would both be o, which is not allowed (unique emojis). So that's invalid.\n\nLet's think of the fourth word: 🐵👽 (two letters). Let's suppose it's \"it\". But first guess had 🐵=i (Feedback: False), so can't be. \"is\": 🐵=i (invalid), 👽=s. \"in\": 🐵=i (invalid), 👽=n (second guess had 👽=n, Feedback: False). \"an\": 🐵=a (second guess had 🐵=a, Feedback: False), 👽=n (invalid). \"on\": 🐵=o, 👽=n. \"at\": 🐵=a (invalid), 👽=t (first guess 👽=t, Feedback: False). \"to\": 🐵=t, 👽=o. \"of\": 🐵=o, 👽=f. \"or\": 🐵=o, 👽=r. \"as\": 🐵=a (invalid), 👽=s. \"he\": 🐵=h, 👽=e. But 🥵=e, so 👽 can't be e. \"she\": 3 letters. \"we\": 🐵=w, 👽=e (invalid). \"me\": 🐵=m, 👽=e (invalid). \"us\": 🐵=u, 👽=s. \"my\": 🐵=m, 👽=y. \"by\": 🐵=b, 👽=y. \"be\": 🐵=b, 👽=e (invalid). \"so\": 🐵=s, 👽=o. \"up\": 🐵=u, 👽=p. \"if\": 🐵=i (invalid), 👽=f. \"do\": 🐵=d, 👽=o. \"no\": 🐵=n, 👽=o. \"go\": 🐵=g, 👽=o.\n\nLet's suppose the fourth word is \"go\": 🐵=g, 👽=o. Let's check if that works. Then, third word is 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 → o 🐹 e 🥶 😇 g e 🧐. So 8 letters: o [2] e [4] [5] g e [8]. Maybe \"orange...\" but \"orange\" is 6 letters. \"operation\": o-p-e-r-a-t-i-o-n (9 letters). \"opulence\": o-p-u-l-e-n-c-e (8 letters). Let's check \"opulence\": o-p-u-l-e-n-c-e. 8 letters: 1: o, 2: p, 3: u, 4: l, 5: e, 6: n, 7: c, 8: e. But 3rd is u, not e. Our third word's 3rd character is e (since 🥵=e). So 3rd character is e. So 1: o, 2: 🐹, 3: e, 4: 🥶, 5: 😇, 6: g, 7: e, 8: 🧐. So 8-letter word: o [2] e [4] [5] g e [8]. Let's think of \"obedience\": o-b-e-d-i-e-n-c-e (9 letters). \"obediene\": o-b-e-d-i-e-n-e (8 letters). 1: o, 2: b, 3: e, 4: d, 5: i, 6: e, 7: n, 8: e. No, 6th would be e, but in our case 6th is g. So that's not. \"overgene\": o-v-e-r-g-e-n-e (8 letters). 1: o, 2: v, 3: e, 4: r, 5: g, 6: e, 7: n, 8: e. But 5th is g (which would be our 5th character 😇=g). So 5th character 😇=g. Then 3rd word: o v e r g e n e. So 1: o (👽=o), 2: v (🐹=v), 3: e (🥵=e), 4: r (🥶=r), 5: g (😇=g), 6: e (🐵=e? No, 🐵 is g here. Wait, 6th character in third word is 🐵, which we supposed is g. So 6th character is g. So \"overgene\" would have 6th as e, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at the first word again. If the first word is \"September\", which is 9 letters: s-e-p-t-e-m-b-e-r. Let's check:\n\ns (🐹), e (😇), p (🐔), t (🐔), e (🥵), m (🥺), b (😴), e (🥵), r (🥶). So:\n\n🐹 = s\n\n😇 = e\n\n🐔 = p and t? No, because 🐔 is the same emoji, so p and t can't be. So that's invalid.\n\nAlternatively, \"something\": s-o-m-e-t-h-i-n-g. 9 letters. 1: s, 2: o, 3: m, 4: e, 5: t, 6: h, 7: i, 8: n, 9: g. But 5th is t, 8th is n. Not matching.\n\nLet's think of the fifth word: 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 → [1][2][3][4]e[6]. Let's suppose this is \"tables\": t-a-b-l-e-s. Then 1: t (🦆=t), 2: a (👽=a), 3: b (🥶=b), 4: l (🐼=l), 5: e (🥵=e), 6: s (🐔=s). Let's check if this works. Then:\n\n🦆=t, 👽=a, 🥶=b, 🐼=l, 🐔=s. Let's check previous guesses: in first guess, 🐔 was t (False), second guess 🐔=r (False). So 🐔=s is possible. 🦆 was guessed as s (False) and m (False), so 🦆=t is possible. 👽 was guessed as t (False) and n (False), so 👽=a is possible. 🥶 was guessed as y (False) and s (False), so 🥶=b is possible. 🐼 was guessed as l (False) and p (False), so 🐼=l is possible (but first guess had 🐼=l, Feedback: False. Oh, first guess had 🐼=l, Feedback: False, so 🐼 can't be l. So that's invalid. So 🐼=l is not allowed.\n\nAnother 6-letter word: \"cables\": c-a-b-l-e-s. 5th e, 6th s. So 🐔=s, 🐼=l (invalid). \"fables\": f-a-b-l-e-s. Same issue. \"gables\": g-a-b-l-e-s. Same. \"jables\": not a word. \"kables\": no. \"mables\": no. \"pables\": no. \"rables\": no. \"sables\": s-a-b-l-e-s. 1: s (🦆=s), 2: a (👽=a), 3: b (🥶=b), 4: l (🐼=l, invalid), 5: e, 6: s (🐔=s). No. \"tables\" we tried. \"vables\": no. \"wables\": no. \"xables\": no. \"yables\": no. \"zables\": no. So maybe 6th character isn't s. Let's think of \"apple\" (5 letters), \"ample\" (5), \"angels\" (6 letters: a-n-g-e-l-s). 5th e, 6th s. So 🐔=s, 🐼=l (invalid). \"bangles\": b-a-n-g-l-e-s (7 letters). \"candles\": 7 letters. \"dances\": d-a-n-c-e-s. 6 letters: 1: d, 2: a, 3: n, 4: c, 5: e, 6: s. So 5th e, 6th s. So 🐔=s. Then fifth word: 🦆=d, 👽=a, 🥶=n, 🐼=c, 🥵=e, 🐔=s. Let's check if 🐼=c is possible. Previous guesses: first guess 🐼=l (False), second guess 🐼=p (False). So yes, possible. So 🐼=c.\n\nLet's proceed with this. So fifth word: 🦆=d, 👽=a, 🥶=n, 🐼=c, 🥵=e, 🐔=s.\n\nNow, the fourth word is 🐵👽 → 🐵 a. If the fourth word is \"an\", then 🐵=a. But second guess had 🐵=a (Feedback: False), so that's invalid. If the fourth word is \"as\", then 🐵=s, 👽=a. But 🐔=s, so 🐵 can't be s (unique). \"at\": 🐵=t, 👽=a. \"am\": 🐵=m, 👽=a. \"ap\": 🐵=p, 👽=a. \"ax\": 🐵=x, 👽=a. \"ay\": 🐵=y, 👽=a. \"ao\": 🐵=o, 👽=a. \"ai\": 🐵=i (first guess 🐵=i, Feedback: False). So possible options: 🐵=t, m, p, x, y, o.\n\nLet's look at the second word: 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 → [🐵] n [😇] [🤑] [🥺] s. 6 letters ending with s. Common 6-letter words ending with s: \"answers\" (a-n-s-w-e-r-s, 7 letters), \"bananas\" (7), \"basics\" (b-a-s-i-c-s). 6 letters: b-a-s-i-c-s. So 1: b, 2: a, 3: s, 4: i, 5: c, 6: s. But 6th is s (matches 🐔=s). So second word could be \"basics\": b-a-s-i-c-s. Then:\n\n🐵=b, 🥶=a (but earlier we assumed 🥶=n, which conflicts. So that's not. Alternatively, \"jackets\" (8 letters). \"glasses\" (7 letters). \"classes\" (7 letters). \"dresses\" (7 letters). \"presses\" (7 letters). \"passes\" (6 letters: p-a-s-s-e-s). 6 letters: p-a-s-s-e-s. So 1: p, 2: a, 3: s, 4: s, 5: e, 6: s. So 🐵=p, 🥶=a, 😇=s, 🤑=s (conflict), 🥺=e, 🐔=s (conflict). No. \"fusses\" (6 letters: f-u-s-s-e-s). 1: f, 2: u, 3: s, 4: s, 5: e, 6: s. So 🐵=f, 🥶=u, 😇=s, 🤑=s (conflict), 🥺=e, 🐔=s (conflict). No. \"gasses\" (6 letters: g-a-s-s-e-s). 1: g, 2: a, 3: s, 4: s, 5: e, 6: s. So 🐵=g, 🥶=a, 😇=s, 🤑=s (conflict), 🥺=e, 🐔=s (conflict). No. \"hisses\" (6 letters: h-i-s-s-e-s). 1: h, 2: i, 3: s, 4: s, 5: e, 6: s. So 🐵=h, 🥶=i, 😇=s, 🤑=s (conflict), 🥺=e, 🐔=s (conflict). No. \"kisses\" (6 letters: k-i-s-s-e-s). Same as hisses. \"messes\" (6 letters: m-e-s-s-e-s). 1: m, 2: e, 3: s, 4: s, 5: e, 6: s. So 🐵=m, 🥶=e (but 🥵=e, conflict), 😇=s, 🤑=s (conflict), 🥺=e (conflict), 🐔=s (conflict). No. \"pauses\" (6 letters: p-a-u-s-e-s). 1: p, 2: a, 3: u, 4: s, 5: e, 6: s. So 🐵=p, 🥶=a, 😇=u, 🤑=s, 🥺=e, 🐔=s. Let's check:\n\nSecond word: p a u s e s → \"pauses\". That's a valid word. So:\n\n🐵=p, 🥶=a, 😇=u, 🤑=s, 🥺=e, 🐔=s. But 🐔=s and 🤑=s would be the same letter, which is not allowed (each emoji must map to unique letters). So that's invalid.\n\nAnother 6-letter word ending with s: \"voices\" (v-o-i-c-e-s). 1: v, 2: o, 3: i, 4: c, 5: e, 6: s. So 🐵=v, 🥶=o, 😇=i, 🤑=c, 🥺=e, 🐔=s. Let's check:\n\nSecond word: v o i c e s → \"voices\". That's valid. So:\n\n🐵=v, 🥶=o, 😇=i, 🤑=c, 🥺=e, 🐔=s. But 🥺=e would conflict with 🥵=e (since emojis are unique, each maps to a unique letter). So that's invalid.\n\nLet's try another approach. The sixth word is 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 (5 letters). Let's assume it's \"happy\": h-a-p-p-y. But not sure. Or \"hello\": h-e-l-l-o.\n\nLet's look at the third word again: 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 → [👽][🐹]e[🥶][😇][🐵]e[🧐]. Suppose this is \"planet\" (6 letters), but it's 8 letters. Let's think of \"complete\": c-o-m-p-l-e-t-e. 8 letters: 1: c, 2: o, 3: m, 4: p, 5: l, 6: e, 7: t, 8: e. So 3rd m, 7th t, 8th e. No, 3rd is m, not e. \"complete\" has e in 6th and 8th positions. Our third word has e in 3rd and 7th positions. \"retrieve\": r-e-t-r-i-e-v-e. 8 letters. 1: r, 2: e, 3: t, 4: r, 5: i, 6: e, 7: v, 8: e. 3rd t, 7th v, 8th e. No. \"resemble\": r-e-s-e-m-b-l-e. 8 letters. 1: r, 2: e, 3: s, 4: e, 5: m, 6: b, 7: l, 8: e. 3rd s, 4th e, 8th e. Our third word has e in 3rd and 7th positions. \"resemble\" has e in 2nd, 4th, 8th.\n\nLet's think of the first word again. Let's suppose it's \"birthdaye\" (not a word). No. \"birthday\" is 8 letters. \"birthdays\" is 9 letters: b-i-r-t-h-d-a-y-s. 1: b, 2: i, 3: r, 4: t, 5: h, 6: d, 7: a, 8: y, 9: s. 5th h, 8th y, 9th s. No.\n\nMaybe the first word is \"somethinge\" (no). Let's think of the encoded sentence's structure. It ends with 1983, which is a year. So the sentence might be a statement about a year. Like \"In 1983, ...\". Let's look at the fourth word: 🐵👽. If the sentence is \"In 1983\", then \"In\" would be the fourth word. So \"In\" → 🐵=i, 👽=n. But first guess had 🐵=i (Feedback: False), second guess 👽=n (Feedback: False). So that's invalid. \"On 1983\" → \"On\" → 🐵=o, 👽=n. 👽=n was guessed in second attempt (Feedback: False). \"At 1983\" → \"At\" → 🐵=a (second guess 🐵=a, Feedback: False), 👽=t (first guess 👽=t, Feedback: False). \"By 1983\" → \"By\" → 🐵=b, 👽=y. \"Of 1983\" → \"Of\" → 🐵=o, 👽=f. \"For 1983\" → \"For\" is 3 letters. \"The 1983\" → \"The\" is 3 letters. \"With 1983\" → \"With\" is 4 letters. So maybe the fourth word is \"by\" → 🐵=b, 👽=y. Let's try that.\n\nFourth word: 🐵=b, 👽=y.\n\nThird word: 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 → y 🐹 e 🥶 😇 b e 🧐. 8 letters: y [2] e [4] [5] b e [8]. Let's think of \"y...eb...e\". Maybe \"yodeler\" (y-o-d-e-l-e-r) → 7 letters. \"yellows\": y-e-l-l-o-w-s (7 letters). \"yesterbe\": Not a word. \"yesterde\": No. \"yesterme\": No. \"yesterday\": y-e-s-t-e-r-d-a-y (9 letters). No. \"yellowed\": y-e-l-l-o-w-e-d (8 letters). 1: y, 2: e, 3: l, 4: l, 5: o, 6: w, 7: e, 8: d. So 3rd l, 7th e, 8th d. Our third word's 3rd is e, 7th is e. So 3rd character e, 7th e. \"yellowed\" has 3rd l, 7th e. No. \"yelled\": y-e-l-l-e-d (6 letters). No. \"yeasted\": y-e-a-s-t-e-d (7 letters). 1: y, 2: e, 3: a, 4: s, 5: t, 6: e, 7: d. 3rd a, 6th e. No. \"yerked\": y-e-r-k-e-d (6 letters). 3rd r, 5th e. No.\n\nLet's try to consider that the first word has two 🐔, which could be 't' (since 't' is the second most common letter). Let's assume 🐔=t. Then the first word is 🐹😇tt e 🥺😴e 🥶. So 1 2 t t e [6][7]e [9]. Let's think of \"butterse\" (not a word). \"Butter\" is 6 letters. \"Butterfly\" is 9 letters: b-u-t-t-e-r-f-l-y. Let's check: 1: b, 2: u, 3: t, 4: t, 5: e, 6: r, 7: f, 8: l, 9: y. So 5th e (correct, 🥵=e), 8th l, 9th y. So first word would be \"butterfly\". Let's map:\n\n🐹=b (first guess had 🐹=b, Feedback: False. Oh, right! First guess was 🐹=b, Feedback: False. So 🐹 can't be b. So that's invalid.\n\nAnother 9-letter word with two t's and two e's: \"committee\" (c-o-m-m-i-t-t-e-e). 3: m, 4: m, 5: i, 6: t, 7: t, 8: e, 9: e. No, 3 and 4 are m, 6 and 7 are t. \"intestate\": i-n-t-e-s-t-a-t-e. 9 letters. 1: i, 2: n, 3: t, 4: e, 5: s, 6: t, 7: a, 8: t, 9: e. 3: t, 6: t, 8: t, 9: e. So three t's and one e. No. \"intertext\": i-n-t-e-r-t-e-x-t. 9 letters. 3: t, 6: t, 7: e, 9: t. No. \"attested\": a-t-t-e-s-t-e-d. 8 letters. 1: a, 2: t, 3: t, 4: e, 5: s, 6: t, 7: e, 8: d. So 3: t, 6: t, 4: e, 7: e. 8 letters. So the first word's structure is 9 letters. \"attested\" is 8 letters.\n\nLet's think of the first word's length again: 9 characters. Let's think of \"aftertaste\": a-f-t-e-r-t-a-s-e. 9 letters. 1: a, 2: f, 3: t, 4: e, 5: r, 6: t, 7: a, 8: s, 9: e. 3: t, 6: t, 4: e, 9: e. So 3 and 6 are t, 4 and 9 are e. So the first word's emojis would be:\n\n1: a (🐹), 2: f (😇), 3: t (🐔), 4: e (🥵), 5: r (🥺), 6: t (🐔), 7: a (😴), 8: s (🥶), 9: e (🥵). So the first word would be a f t e r t a s e → \"aftertaste\". Let's check the emojis:\n\n🐹=a, 😇=f, 🐔=t, 🥵=e (correct), 🥺=r, 😴=a (but 🐹 is a, so 😴 can't be a, since emojis must map to unique letters), 🥶=s. So 😴=a would conflict with 🐹=a. So that's invalid.\n\nLet's try to look at the second attempt's feedback. Second guess had 🐹=c (Feedback: False), 😇=o (False), 🐔=r (False), 🥵=e (True), 🥺=d (False), 😴=h (False), 🥶=s (False), 🐵=a (False), 👽=n (False), 🦆=m (False), 🐼=p (False), 🤥=g (False), 🤑=k (False), 🤠=t (False), 🧐=v (False). So none of those are correct except 🥵=e.\n\nLet's try new guesses. Let's assume that the first word is \"sentences\" (s-e-n-t-e-n-c-e-s). 9 letters. 1: s, 2: e, 3: n, 4: t, 5: e, 6: n, 7: c, 8: e, 9: s. So 1: s (🐹), 2: e (😇), 3: n (🐔), 4: t (🐔), 5: e (🥵), 6: n (🥺), 7: c (😴), 8: e (🥵), 9: s (🥶). But 🐔 would be n and t (different letters, but same emoji, so invalid). So that's not.\n\nAnother 9-letter word: \"suggested\" (s-u-g-g-e-s-t-e-d). 9 letters. 1: s, 2: u, 3: g, 4: g, 5: e, 6: s, 7: t, 8: e, 9: d. So 3 and 4: g (🐔=g), 5: e (🥵=e), 8: e (🥵=e). So first word: s u g g e s t e d. So 🐹=s, 😇=u, 🐔=g, 🥵=e, 🥺=s (conflict with 🐹=s), 😴=t, 🥶=d. So 🥺=s would conflict.\n\nLet's try to think of the most frequent emojis. 🐔 appears 4 times. Let's assume 🐔=t (common letter). Then the first word has two t's. Let's assume the first word is \"letterses\" (not a word). \"l e t t e r s e s\". 9 letters. 1: l, 2: e, 3: t, 4: t, 5: e, 6: r, 7: s, 8: e, 9: s. So 🐹=l, 😇=e, 🐔=t, 🥵=e (correct), 🥺=r, 😴=s, 🥶=s (conflict with 😴=s). So no.\n\nAnother angle: The third word is 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐. Since 🥵=e, this is 👽🐹e🥶😇🐵e🧐. Let's assume this is \"example\" (7 letters), but it's 8 letters. \"examples\": e-x-a-m-p-l-e-s (8 letters). 1: e, 2: x, 3: a, 4: m, 5: p, 6: l, 7: e, 8: s. 3rd a, 7th e. No. \"exerting\": e-x-e-r-t-i-n-g (8 letters). 1: e, 2: x, 3: e, 4: r, 5: t, 6: i, 7: n, 8: g. 3rd e, 7th n. So 3rd e (correct, 🥵=e), 7th n. So third word: e x e r t i n g. So 👽=e (but 🥵=e, conflict), 🐹=x, 🥶=r, 😇=t, 🐵=i, 🧐=g. But 👽=e conflicts with 🥵=e.\n\nLet's try to make a guess based on possible letters. Let's try:\n\nAssume 🐔=s (since it's a common letter, and 4 occurrences). Then:\n\nFirst word: 🐹😇ss e 🥺😴e 🥶 → [1][2]ss e [6][7]e [9]. Maybe \"possesses\": p-o-s-s-e-s-s-e-s. 9 letters. 1: p, 2: o, 3: s, 4: s, 5: e, 6: s, 7: s, 8: e, 9: s. So:\n\n🐹=p, 😇=o, 🐔=s, 🥵=e (correct), 🥺=s (conflict with 🐔=s), 😴=s (conflict), 🥶=s (conflict). So no.\n\nAnother possibility: 🐔=r. Let's say 🐔=r. Then the first word has two r's. \"carriers\": c-a-r-r-i-e-r-s. 8 letters. \"carriest\": c-a-r-r-i-e-s-t. 8 letters. \"carriered\": 9 letters: c-a-r-r-i-e-r-e-d. 9 letters. 1: c, 2: a, 3: r, 4: r, 5: i, 6: e, 7: r, 8: e, 9: d. So 3 and 4: r (🐔=r), 5: i (🥺=i), 6: e (🥵=e), 7: r (😴=r, conflict with 🐔=r), 8: e (🥵=e), 9: d (🥶=d). So 😴=r would conflict.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to make a guess with new letters, avoiding previous incorrect ones. Let's try:\n\nAssume the fourth word is \"my\" → 🐵=m, 👽=y.\n\nThen the third word: 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 → y 🐹 e 🥶 😇 m e 🧐. Maybe \"y...em...e\". Let's say \"yellerm\" (not a word). \"yonderem\": No.\n\nAlternatively, let's try 🐵=t, 👽=h (so fourth word \"th\"). Then third word: h 🐹 e 🥶 😇 t e 🧐. Maybe \"the...te...\". \"theater\" (t-h-e-a-t-e-r) → 7 letters. \"theaters\": t-h-e-a-t-e-r-s (8 letters). 1: t, 2: h, 3: e, 4: a, 5: t, 6: e, 7: r, 8: s. So 3rd e (correct), 6th e (correct). So third word: t h e a t e r s → \"theaters\". So:\n\n👽=t (but first guess 👽=t, Feedback: False), 🐹=h, 🥶=a, 😇=t (conflict with 👽=t), 🐵=e (conflict with 🥵=e), 🧐=s. No.\n\nLet's try to make a guess with the following mappings, avoiding previous wrong ones:\n\n- 🐹=d (not guessed before)\n- 😇=i (not guessed before)\n- 🐔=s (not guessed as s before; first guess was t, second r)\n- 🥵=e (correct)\n- 🥺=n (not guessed before)\n- 😴=b (not guessed before)\n- 🥶=k (not guessed before)\n- 🐵=p (not guessed before)\n- 👽=w (not guessed before)\n- 🦆=f (not guessed before)\n- 🐼=c (not guessed before)\n- 🤥=h (not guessed before)\n- 🤑=g (not guessed before)\n- 🤠=y (not guessed before)\n- 🧐=v (not guessed before)\n\nThis is a shot in the dark, but let's try:\n\nAnswer: 🐹=d,😇=i,🐔=s,🥵=e,🥺=n,😴=b,🥶=k,🐵=p,👽=w,🦆=f,🐼=c,🤥=h,🤑=g,🤠=y,🧐=v\n\n\n\nTo solve this Crypto Word Game, we analyze the encoded sentence, hint, and feedback from previous attempts. The key is to map emojis to letters such that the resulting words are valid English words, avoiding previously incorrect mappings. Here's the reasoning:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Hint**: 🥵=e (confirmed correct).\n2. **Feedback**: All previous guesses (except 🥵=e) were incorrect, so we avoid those mappings.\n3. **Structure**: The encoded sentence has 7 parts, with word lengths: 9, 6, 8, 2, 6, 5, and \"1983\" (likely a year).\n4. **Frequency**: Emojis like 🐔 (4x), 🥶 (4x), 🐵 (4x), 😇 (3x), 🥺 (3x), and 👽 (3x) are frequent, suggesting they map to common letters (e.g., s, t, a, o, i, n).\n\n### Guesses:\n- **🐔**: Appears 4 times, often in positions 3-4 of the first word (9 letters). Common letter \"s\" is a strong candidate (not previously guessed for 🐔).\n- **🐵**: Appears 4 times, including a 2-letter word (4th part). Common letter \"p\" (not previously guessed) fits.\n- **👽**: Appears 3 times, including the 2-letter word. \"w\" (not previously guessed) is plausible.\n- **😇**: Appears 3 times. \"i\" (common vowel, not previously guessed) fits.\n- **🥶**: Appears 4 times. \"k\" (not previously guessed) is a candidate.\n- **🥺**: Appears 3 times. \"n\" (common, not previously guessed) fits.\n- **😴**: Appears once. \"b\" (not previously guessed) is a placeholder.\n- **🦆**: Appears once. \"f\" (not previously guessed) is a placeholder.\n- **🐼**: Appears once. \"c\" (not previously guessed) is a placeholder.\n- **🤥**: Appears once. \"h\" (not previously guessed) is a placeholder.\n- **🤑**: Appears twice. \"g\" (not previously guessed) is a placeholder.\n- **🤠**: Appears once. \"y\" (not previously guessed) is a placeholder.\n- **🧐**: Appears once. \"v\" (not previously guessed) is a placeholder.\n- **🐹**: Appears twice. \"d\" (not previously guessed) is a placeholder.\n\n### Final Guess:\nBased on the above, the guess maps emojis to letters avoiding prior errors and prioritizing common letters.\n\nAnswer: 🐹=d,😇=i,🐔=s,🥵=e,🥺=n,😴=b,🥶=k,🐵=p,👽=w,🦆=f,🐼=c,🤥=h,🤑=g,🤠=y,🧐=v","Okay, let's try to figure out this crypto word game. First, let's list out all the information we have. The encoded sentence is: 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 🐵👽 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 1983.\n\nThe hint is 🥵=e, which is already confirmed in all previous guesses. The history shows which emojis were correct in each attempt. Let's go through each attempt's feedback.\n\nFirst attempt: 🥵=e was correct, others were wrong. So 🐹≠b, 😇≠u, 🐔≠t, etc.\n\nSecond attempt: Again, only 🥵=e correct. So 🐹≠c, 😇≠o, 🐔≠r, etc.\n\nThird attempt: Feedback says 🐔=s (True), 🥵=e (True), 🥺=n (True), 🦆=f (True). The rest were wrong. So from attempt 3, we know:\n\n🐔=s (correct)\n🥵=e (correct)\n🥺=n (correct)\n🦆=f (correct)\n\nSo these four are confirmed. Let's note those down. Now, let's substitute these into the encoded sentence to see the structure.\n\nEncoded sentence with knowns:\n\n🐹😇 s s e n 😴 e 🥶 | 🐵🥶😇🤑 n s | 👽🐹 e 🥶😇🐵 e 🧐 | 🐵👽 | f 👽🥶🐼 e s | 🤥 n 🐵🤑🤠 1983.\n\nLet's break down each word:\n\n1. Word 1: [🐹][😇] s s e n [😴] e [🥶] → Let's count letters. Length is 8 characters. So structure: _ _ s s e n _ e _ (assuming each emoji is one letter)\n2. Word 2: [🐵][🥶][😇][🤑] n s → Length 6: _ _ _ _ n s\n3. Word 3: [👽][🐹] e [🥶][😇][🐵] e [🧐] → Length 8: _ _ e _ _ _ e _\n4. Word 4: [🐵][👽] → Length 2: _ _\n5. Word 5: f [👽][🥶][🐼] e s → Length 6: f _ _ _ e s\n6. Word 6: [🤥] n [🐵][🤑][🤠] → Length 5: _ n _ _ _\n7. Then 1983, probably a year.\n\nLet's look for possible words. Let's start with word 5: f _ _ _ e s. The structure is f followed by three letters, then e and s. A common 6-letter word with this pattern could be \"f...es\". Let's think. Maybe \"forest\"? F-O-R-E-S-T? Wait, but word 5 is f [👽][🥶][🐼] e s. So the third to last character is e, then s. So positions: 1:f, 2:👽, 3:🥶, 4:🐼, 5:e, 6:s. So the word is f (👽)(🥶)(🐼) e s. So length 6: positions 1-6. So 1:f, 2:?, 3:?, 4:?, 5:e, 6:s. So the word would be f _ _ _ e s. Let's think of 6-letter words ending with \"es\" where the 5th letter is e. For example, \"fences\"? F-E-N-C-E-S. No, 5th is e. Let's check: F (1), E (2), N (3), C (4), E (5), S (6). That's \"fences\". But in our case, 1 is f (correct, since 🦆=f), 5 is e (correct, 🥵=e), 6 is s (correct, 🐔=s). So 👽 would be E (position 2), 🥶=N (position 3), 🐼=C (position 4). Let's check: 🦆=f, 👽=e, 🥶=n, 🐼=c. Then word 5 would be f e n c e s → \"fences\". That fits! Let's note that.\n\nSo possible 👽=e, 🥶=n, 🐼=c. Let's check if that works with other words.\n\nWord 4: [🐵][👽] → 2 letters. If 👽=e, then the word is [🐵] e. So 2-letter words ending with e: \"be\", \"he\", \"me\", \"we\", \"ye\", \"se\", \"re\", \"ne\". Let's see. Let's hold that thought.\n\nWord 2: [🐵][🥶][😇][🤑] n s. If 🥶=n, then word 2 is [🐵] n [😇][🤑] n s. Length 6. Let's see: positions 1:🐵, 2:n, 3:😇, 4:🤑, 5:n, 6:s. So the word is _ n _ _ n s. Possible 6-letter words. Let's think: \"annual\"? A-N-N-U-A-L? No, 6 letters: A-N-N-U-A-L (6 letters, but 5th is a). Not matching. \"canvans\"? No. \"bananas\"? B-A-N-A-N-A-S. No, 7 letters. \"mansion\"? M-A-N-S-I-O-N. No. \"pension\"? P-E-N-S-I-O-N. No. \"enson\"? No. Maybe \"banners\"? B-A-N-N-E-R-S. No, 7 letters. Alternatively, maybe the structure is [🐵] (n) [😇] [🤑] (n) (s). Let's think of 6-letter words ending with \"ns\". Like \"ponsons\"? No. \"pons\" is 4 letters. Maybe \"bonsai\" no. Alternatively, maybe \"minions\"? M-I-N-I-O-N-S. No, 7 letters. Hmm. Let's check other words.\n\nWord 3: [👽][🐹] e [🥶][😇][🐵] e [🧐]. If 👽=e (from word 5), then 👽=e. So word 3 starts with e. Then [🐹] is next letter. So word 3: e [🐹] e [🥶][😇][🐵] e [🧐]. Let's substitute 🥶=n (from word 5), so e [🐹] e n [😇][🐵] e [🧐]. Length 8. Let's count: 1:e, 2:🐹, 3:e, 4:n, 5:😇, 6:🐵, 7:e, 8:🧐. So the structure is e _ e n _ _ e _. Maybe \"element\"? No, 7 letters. \"elephant\"? E-L-E-P-H-A-N-T. 8 letters. Let's check: E (1), L (2), E (3), P (4), H (5), A (6), N (7), T (8). So positions 1-8: E L E P H A N T. Comparing with our structure: 1:e (👽=e), 2:🐹 (needs to be L), 3:e (correct), 4:n (🥶=n), 5:😇 (needs to be H), 6:🐵 (needs to be A), 7:e (correct), 8:🧐 (needs to be T). That's a possible fit. Let's check:\n\nIf 👽=e, then word 3: e [🐹] e n [😇][🐵] e [🧐] → e L e n H A e T → \"elephant\". That works! So:\n\n👽=e (as per word 5)\n🐹=l (position 2: L)\n🥶=n (position 4: N)\n😇=h (position 5: H)\n🐵=a (position 6: A)\n🧐=t (position 8: T)\n\nLet's check if that works with other words. Let's check word 4: [🐵][👽] → [A][E] → \"ae\"? No, but \"ae\" is a word (a type of tree). Alternatively, maybe my assumption is wrong. Let's see. If 🐵=a and 👽=e, then word 4 is a e → \"ae\" (a Scottish term for \"one\"). Maybe possible.\n\nNow, let's check word 1: [🐹][😇] s s e n [😴] e [🥶]. If 🐹=l, 😇=h, 🥶=n, then word 1 is l h s s e n [😴] e n. So structure: l h s s e n _ e n. Length 8. Let's count letters: 1:l, 2:h, 3:s, 4:s, 5:e, 6:n, 7:😴, 8:e, 9:n? Wait, the original word 1 is 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 → that's 9 emojis, so 9 letters. Oh, I miscounted earlier. Let's correct that. The first word is 9 characters: positions 1-9. So:\n\n1:🐹, 2:😇, 3:🐔, 4:🐔, 5:🥵, 6:🥺, 7:😴, 8:🥵, 9:🥶.\n\nWe know:\n\n3:🐔=s, 4:🐔=s, 5:🥵=e, 6:🥺=n, 8:🥵=e, 9:🥶=n. So word 1: [🐹][😇] s s e n [😴] e n. So letters 1:?, 2:?, 3:s, 4:s, 5:e, 6:n, 7:?, 8:e, 9:n. So the word is _ _ s s e n _ e n. Let's think of 9-letter words with that pattern. Let's see: \"glasses\" is 7 letters. \"classmen\"? C-L-A-S-S-M-E-N. 8 letters. \"classroom\"? C-L-A-S-S-R-O-O-M. 9 letters. Let's check: C-L-A-S-S-R-O-O-M. No. \"lessens\"? 7 letters. \"lessened\"? 8 letters. \"lessening\"? L-E-S-S-E-N-I-N-G. 9 letters. Let's check: L (1), E (2), S (3), S (4), E (5), N (6), I (7), N (8), G (9). No, 8th is N, 9th is G. Our structure 8th is e, 9th is n. So 8th letter is e. Let's think: _ _ s s e n _ e n. Maybe \"lessonend\"? No. \"hasselben\"? No. Alternatively, \"hasselen\"? H-A-S-S-E-L-E-N. 8 letters. \"hasselbent\"? 9 letters. H-A-S-S-E-L-B-E-N. That fits: H (1), A (2), S (3), S (4), E (5), L (6), B (7), E (8), N (9). But in our case, 1:🐹, 2:😇. If 🐹=h, 😇=a, then the word would be h a s s e l b e n. Not a common word. Alternatively, maybe \"musselsen\"? No. Alternatively, perhaps \"tasselpen\"? No. Maybe \"dasselven\"? No. Let's check if our earlier assumption for 🐹=l and 😇=h is correct.\n\nFrom word 3: [👽][🐹] e [🥶][😇][🐵] e [🧐] → 👽=e, 🐹=l, e, 🥶=n, 😇=h, 🐵=a, e, 🧐=t. So word 3: e l e n h a e t → \"elenhaet\"? Doesn't make sense. Oh, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's re-examine word 3. The original third word is 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐. Let's count the emojis: 👽, 🐹, 🥵, 🥶, 😇, 🐵, 🥵, 🧐. That's 8 emojis, so 8 letters. So positions 1-8: 1:👽, 2:🐹, 3:🥵, 4:🥶, 5:😇, 6:🐵, 7:🥵, 8:🧐. So 3:🥵=e, 7:🥵=e. So the word is [👽][🐹] e [🥶][😇][🐵] e [🧐]. So 8 letters: 1:?, 2:?, 3:e, 4:?, 5:?, 6:?, 7:e, 8:?.\n\nEarlier, I thought 👽=e (from word 5). Let's confirm word 5. Word 5: 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 → 🦆=f, 👽=?, 🥶=?, 🐼=?, 🥵=e, 🐔=s. So 6 letters: f, ?, ?, ?, e, s. So the word is f _ _ _ e s. Let's think of 6-letter words ending with \"es\" where the 5th letter is e. For example, \"fences\" (F-E-N-C-E-S). That would be 1:f, 2:e, 3:n, 4:c, 5:e, 6:s. So 👽=e (position 2), 🥶=n (position 3), 🐼=c (position 4). That's possible. So word 5 is \"fences\".\n\nSo 👽=e, 🥶=n, 🐼=c. Then word 4 is 🐵👽 → 🐵 and 👽=e. So 2-letter word: [🐵] e. Possible words: \"be\", \"he\", \"me\", \"we\", \"ye\", \"se\", \"re\", \"ne\". Let's say 🐵=h → \"he\". Let's try that. So 🐵=h.\n\nWord 2: 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 → 🐵=h, 🥶=n, 🥺=n, 🐔=s. So the word is h n [😇][🤑] n s. 6 letters: h n _ _ n s. Possible words: \"harness\"? H-A-R-N-E-S-S. No, 7 letters. \"hannas\"? H-A-N-N-A-S. 6 letters. H-A-N-N-A-S. So positions 1:h, 2:n, 3:a, 4:n, 5:a, 6:s. But our structure is h n _ _ n s. So 5th letter is n. \"hannas\" has 5th letter a. Not matching. \"hanson\"? H-A-N-S-O-N. 6 letters: 1:h, 2:a, 3:n, 4:s, 5:o, 6:n. No. \"hansen\"? H-A-N-S-E-N. 6 letters: 1:h, 2:a, 3:n, 4:s, 5:e, 6:n. No. \"harness\" is 7 letters. Alternatively, \"honesns\"? No. Maybe \"hinden\"? No. Let's try another approach.\n\nLooking at word 6: 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 → 🥺=n, 🐵=h (if we take that). So word 6: [🤥] n h [🤑][🤠]. 5 letters: _ n h _ _. Possible words: \"bunh...\" no. \"funky\"? F-U-N-K-Y. No. \"sunny\"? S-U-N-N-Y. No. \"punky\"? P-U-N-K-Y. No. \"hunky\"? H-U-N-K-Y. But the first letter is h, but 🤥 is the first emoji. So if 🤥=h, then \"hunk...\" but h is already 🐵=h? No, emojis are unique. Each emoji maps to a unique letter.\n\nLet's go back to the third attempt's feedback. Attempt 3 guessed:\n\n🐹=d,😇=i,🐔=s,🥵=e,🥺=n,😴=b,🥶=k,🐵=p,👽=w,🦆=f,🐼=c,🤥=h,🤑=g,🤠=y,🧐=v\n\nFeedback was: 🐔=s (True), 🥵=e (True), 🥺=n (True), 🦆=f (True). So 🐼=c was False (so 🐼≠c). Oh, I made a mistake earlier. The third attempt's 🐼=c was marked False, so 🐼≠c. So my previous assumption of 🐼=c is incorrect. So word 5: 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 → f 👽 🥶 🐼 e s. So 👽, 🥶, 🐼 are unknown, but 👽≠w (from attempt 3: 👽=w was False), 🥶≠k (attempt 3: 🥶=k was False), 🐼≠c (attempt 3: 🐼=c was False).\n\nLet's re-express the knowns:\n\nConfirmed from feedback:\n\n🐔=s (attempt 3)\n🥵=e (hint)\n🥺=n (attempt 3)\n🦆=f (attempt 3)\n\nOther emojis from previous attempts are known to be incorrect. For example:\n\nFrom attempt 1: 🐹≠b, 😇≠u, 🐔≠t (but 🐔 is s now), 🥺≠r, 😴≠f, 🥶≠y, 🐵≠i, 👽≠t, 🦆≠s (but 🦆 is f), 🐼≠l, 🤥≠g, 🤑≠n, 🤠≠d, 🧐≠s.\n\nAttempt 2: 🐹≠c, 😇≠o, 🐔≠r (but 🐔 is s), 🥺≠d, 😴≠h, 🥶≠s, 🐵≠a, 👽≠n, 🦆≠m, 🐼≠p, 🤥≠g, 🤑≠k, 🤠≠t, 🧐≠v.\n\nAttempt 3: 🐹≠d, 😇≠i, 🐔=s (correct), 🥵=e (correct), 🥺=n (correct), 😴≠b, 🥶≠k, 🐵≠p, 👽≠w, 🦆=f (correct), 🐼≠c, 🤥≠h, 🤑≠g, 🤠≠y, 🧐≠v.\n\nSo, possible letters not used yet (since each emoji maps to a unique letter, and we need to assign letters not already taken by the confirmed ones. Confirmed letters: s (🐔), e (🥵), n (🥺), f (🦆). So other letters are a,b,c,d,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,o,p,q,r,t,u,v,w,x,y,z.\n\nLet's look at word 1: 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 → letters: [🐹][😇] s s e n [😴] e [🥶]. 9 letters. So structure: _ _ s s e n _ e _.\n\nLet's think of 9-letter words ending with \"en\" (since the 8th is e, 9th is [🥶], which could be n? Let's see. If [🥶]=d, then the word ends with e d. Not sure. Let's think of a common 9-letter word with \"ssen\" in the middle. Like \"possession\" (p-o-s-s-e-s-s-i-o-n). No, 10 letters. \"procession\" (p-r-o-c-e-s-s-i-o-n). 10 letters. \"passenger\" (p-a-s-s-e-n-g-e-r). 9 letters! Let's check: P (1), A (2), S (3), S (4), E (5), N (6), G (7), E (8), R (9). So positions 1-9: P A S S E N G E R. That's \"passenger\". Let's check the structure:\n\n[🐹] = P (position 1)\n[😇] = A (position 2)\n[🐔] = S (position 3,4 → correct, since 🐔=s)\n[🥵] = E (position 5,8 → correct, 🥵=e)\n[🥺] = N (position 6 → correct, 🥺=n)\n[😴] = G (position 7)\n[🥶] = R (position 9)\n\nYes! That fits. So \"passenger\" would be the first word. Let's verify:\n\nWord 1: 🐹=p, 😇=a, 🐔=s, 🐔=s, 🥵=e, 🥺=n, 😴=g, 🥵=e, 🥶=r → \"passenger\". Perfect!\n\nSo let's note these:\n\n🐹=p (since 1st letter is P)\n😇=a (2nd letter A)\n😴=g (7th letter G)\n🥶=r (9th letter R)\n\nNow, let's check other words with these new mappings.\n\nWord 2: 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 → letters: [🐵] [🥶] [😇] [🤑] [🥺] [🐔]. We have 🥶=r, 😇=a, 🥺=n, 🐔=s. So the word is [🐵] r a [🤑] n s. 6 letters. Structure: _ r a _ n s. Let's think of 6-letter words. \"marathon\" is 8 letters. \"parsnip\" is 7. \"barons\": B-A-R-O-N-S. 6 letters. B (1), A (2), R (3), O (4), N (5), S (6). But our structure is [🐵] r a [🤑] n s. So 1: [🐵], 2:r, 3:a, 4:[🤑], 5:n, 6:s. \"barons\" would be B-R-A-O-N-S. That matches! So 1: B (🐵=b), 2:r, 3:a, 4:o (🤑=o), 5:n, 6:s. So \"barons\". Let's check:\n\n[🐵]=b, 🥶=r (correct), 😇=a (correct), 🤑=o, 🥺=n (correct), 🐔=s (correct). So word 2: b r a o n s → \"barons\". That works!\n\nSo 🐵=b, 🤑=o.\n\nWord 3: 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 → letters: [👽] [🐹] [🥵] [🥶] [😇] [🐵] [🥵] [🧐]. We have 🐹=p, 🥵=e, 🥶=r, 😇=a, 🐵=b. So the word is [👽] p e r a b e [🧐]. 8 letters. Structure: _ p e r a b e _. Let's think of 8-letter words. \"September\"? S-E-P-T-E-M-B-E-R. No. \"perabeb...\" Not helpful. \"superb...\" S-U-P-E-R-B... Let's see: \"superb\" is 7 letters. \"superb\" + something. \"superb\" is S-U-P-E-R-B. No. \"asperber\"? No. Alternatively, \"tapered\"? T-A-P-E-R-E-D. 7 letters. \"taperers\"? 8 letters: T-A-P-E-R-E-R-S. No. Let's think of the structure: [👽] p e r a b e [🧐]. Let's try \"capered\" (C-A-P-E-R-E-D). No, 7 letters. \"scraper\": S-C-R-A-P-E-R. 7 letters. \"stapler\": S-T-A-P-L-E-R. 7 letters. Maybe \"sperber\"? S-P-E-R-B-E-R. 7 letters. Alternatively, \"sperber\" is a name. Alternatively, let's think of 8-letter words where the second letter is p. \"slipper\" (S-L-I-P-P-E-R). No. \"clapper\" (C-L-A-P-P-E-R). 7 letters. \"rapperer\"? No. \"popperer\"? No. Maybe \"spreader\": S-P-R-E-A-D-E-R. 8 letters. S-P-R-E-A-D-E-R. Structure: S (👽=s), P (🐹=p), R (no, 3rd letter is e). No. Let's check the letters again. Word 3: 👽 (1), 🐹=p (2), 🥵=e (3), 🥶=r (4), 😇=a (5), 🐵=b (6), 🥵=e (7), 🧐 (8). So 1:?, 2:p, 3:e, 4:r, 5:a, 6:b, 7:e, 8:?. So the word is _ p e r a b e _. Let's think of \"superb\" but that's 7 letters. \"superb\" + 'l' → \"superbl\"? No. \"superb\" + 'y' → \"superby\". No. Alternatively, \"sperber\" (S-P-E-R-B-E-R) → 7 letters. Maybe \"sperber\" is 7 letters. Let's think of \"sperber\" as 7 letters. So perhaps the 8th letter is a different letter. Alternatively, maybe \"sperber\" is not the word, and we need to find another.\n\nWord 4: 🐵👽 → [🐵]=b, [👽]=?. So 2-letter word: b ?. Possible words: \"be\", \"by\", \"bu\", \"bi\", \"bo\", \"ba\", \"bk\" (unlikely). Let's think if 👽 could be 'y'. Then word 4 is \"by\". That's a common word. Let's try 👽=y.\n\nWord 3 with 👽=y: y p e r a b e [🧐]. So \"yperabe_\". Not helpful. Maybe 👽=s. Then word 4 is \"bs\" (unlikely). 👽=t → \"bt\" (no). 👽=c → \"bc\" (no). 👽=d → \"bd\" (no). 👽=g → \"bg\" (no). 👽=h → \"bh\" (no). 👽=j → \"bj\" (no). 👽=k → \"bk\" (no). 👽=l → \"bl\" (common word \"bl\" no, but \"bl\" is not a word). 👽=m → \"bm\" (no). 👽=n → \"bn\" (no). 👽=o → \"bo\" (yes, \"bo\" is a word, a nickname). 👽=q → \"bq\" (no). 👽=r → \"br\" (no). 👽=t → \"bt\" (no). 👽=u → \"bu\" (yes, \"bu\" is a word, a type of tree). 👽=v → \"bv\" (no). 👽=w → \"bw\" (no). 👽=x → \"bx\" (no). 👽=z → \"bz\" (no). So possible 2-letter words: \"bo\" (👽=o), \"bu\" (👽=u), \"by\" (👽=y). Let's check with word 5.\n\nWord 5: 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 → 🦆=f, 👽=?, 🥶=r, 🐼=?, 🥵=e, 🐔=s. So 6 letters: f [👽] r [🐼] e s. Structure: f _ r _ e s. Let's think of 6-letter words. \"forest\": F-O-R-E-S-T. No, 6 letters: F-O-R-E-S-T (6 letters). But in our case, it's f [👽] r [🐼] e s. \"forest\" would be F-O-R-E-S-T. So 👽=o, 🐼=e. But 🥵=e, so 🐼 can't be e (unique letters). So 👽=o, 🐼=e is invalid. Next, \"ferret\": F-E-R-R-E-T. 6 letters. F-E-R-R-E-T. So 👽=e, 🐼=r. But 🥶=r, so 🐼 can't be r. \"ferret\" is F-E-R-R-E-T. 👽=e (but 👽=e would make word 4 \"be\" if 🐵=b). Let's check. If 👽=e, then word 4 is \"be\" (b and e). Word 5: f e r [🐼] e s. So 6 letters: f e r [🐼] e s. Let's think of \"ferves\" (no). \"ferrets\": F-E-R-R-E-T-S. 7 letters. \"fervent\": 7 letters. \"fervent\" no. \"fervids\": F-E-R-V-I-D-S. 7 letters. Alternatively, \"ferrule\": F-E-R-R-U-L-E. 7 letters. Not helpful.\n\nLet's go back to word 3. If word 3 is 👽 p e r a b e [🧐], and 👽=s, then it's s p e r a b e [🧐]. \"sperabe...\" Not a word. Maybe 👽=t, then \"tperabe...\". No. Alternatively, maybe the word is \"rapperer\"? No. Let's think of other possibilities. Maybe the first word is not \"passenger\". Let's try another approach.\n\nLet's list all the emojis and their possible letters, considering confirmed ones:\n\nConfirmed:\n🐔=s\n🥵=e\n🥺=n\n🦆=f\n\nOther emojis to guess: 🐹, 😇, 😴, 🥶, 🐵, 👽, 🐼, 🤥, 🤑, 🤠, 🧐.\n\nLet's look at the frequency of emojis. Let's count how many times each emoji appears:\n\nEncoded sentence:\n\n🐹 (1), 😇 (1), 🐔 (3), 🥵 (3), 🥺 (2), 😴 (1), 🥶 (3), 🐵 (3), 👽 (3), 🦆 (1), 🐼 (1), 🤥 (1), 🤑 (2), 🤠 (1), 🧐 (1).\n\nSo the most frequent emojis are 🐔 (3), 🥵 (3), 🥺 (2), 🥶 (3), 🐵 (3), 👽 (3), 🤑 (2). We know 🥵=e (hint), 🐔=s (from attempt 3), 🥺=n (attempt 3), 🦆=f (attempt 3). So the remaining frequent ones are 🥶 (3), 🐵 (3), 👽 (3), 🤑 (2).\n\nLet's look for 3-letter words. The fourth word is 🐵👽 (2 letters). Let's assume it's \"it\", \"is\", \"in\", \"on\", \"at\", \"to\", \"of\", \"or\", \"an\", \"as\", \"he\", \"she\", \"we\", \"me\", \"be\", \"by\", \"my\", \"so\", \"no\", \"go\", \"up\", \"if\", \"do\", \"get\" (no, 3 letters). So 2-letter words.\n\nLet's try to find the 2-letter word 🐵👽. Let's say it's \"it\". So 🐵=i, 👽=t. But attempt 1 had 🐵=i (False), 👽=t (False). So no. \"is\": 🐵=i, 👽=s. But 🐔=s, so 👽 can't be s. \"in\": 🐵=i, 👽=n. But 🥺=n, so 👽 can't be n. \"on\": 🐵=o, 👽=n. 🥺=n, so 👽 can't be n. \"at\": 🐵=a, 👽=t. Attempt 2 had 🐵=a (False), 👽=t (attempt 1 had 👽=t, which was False). \"to\": 🐵=t, 👽=o. Possible. \"of\": 🐵=o, 👽=f. 🦆=f, so 👽 can't be f. \"or\": 🐵=o, 👽=r. Possible. \"an\": 🐵=a, 👽=n. 🥺=n, no. \"as\": 🐵=a, 👽=s. 🐔=s, no. \"he\": 🐵=h, 👽=e. 🥵=e, so 👽 can't be e. \"she\": 3 letters. \"we\": 🐵=w, 👽=e. 🥵=e, no. \"me\": 🐵=m, 👽=e. 🥵=e, no. \"be\": 🐵=b, 👽=e. 🥵=e, 👽=e would conflict. \"by\": 🐵=b, 👽=y. Possible. \"my\": 🐵=m, 👽=y. Possible. \"so\": 🐵=s, 👽=o. 🐔=s, no. \"no\": 🐵=n, 👽=o. 🥺=n, no. \"go\": 🐵=g, 👽=o. Possible. \"up\": 🐵=u, 👽=p. Possible. \"if\": 🐵=i, 👽=f. 🦆=f, no. \"do\": 🐵=d, 👽=o. Possible.\n\nLet's consider \"by\" (🐵=b, 👽=y). Then word 4 is \"by\". Let's check word 5: 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 → f y [🥶][🐼] e s. 6 letters: f y _ _ e s. \"fey...\" Not common. \"fuzzy\" is 5 letters. \"feyers\"? No. \"feyers\" not a word. Maybe \"fey...\" not helpful.\n\nAnother option: \"do\" (🐵=d, 👽=o). Word 4: \"do\". Then word 5: f o [🥶][🐼] e s → f o _ _ e s. \"folkses\"? No. \"folks\" is 5 letters. \"forest\" is f o r e s t (6 letters). So f o r e s t. So 👽=o (so word 4 is \"do\"), 🥶=r, 🐼=e. But 🥵=e, so 🐼 can't be e. Conflict.\n\nAnother option: \"go\" (🐵=g, 👽=o). Word 4: \"go\". Word 5: f o [🥶][🐼] e s → \"forest\" again. 🥶=r, 🐼=e. Again, 🐼=e conflicts with 🥵=e.\n\nAnother option: \"up\" (🐵=u, 👽=p). Word 4: \"up\". Word 5: f p [🥶][🐼] e s → \"fp...es\". Unlikely.\n\nAnother option: \"my\" (🐵=m, 👽=y). Word 4: \"my\". Word5: f y [🥶][🐼] e s → \"fy...es\". Unlikely.\n\nLet's try \"he\" (🐵=h, 👽=e). But 👽=e would conflict with 🥵=e. So no.\n\nLet's try \"it\" (🐵=i, 👽=t). Attempt 1 had 🐵=i (False), 👽=t (False). So no.\n\nLet's think of the third word: 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 → 👽, 🐹, e, 🥶, 😇, 🐵, e, 🧐. Let's say this word is \"element\" (e-l-e-m-e-n-t). 7 letters. No. \"elephant\" (e-l-e-p-h-a-n-t). 8 letters. E-L-E-P-H-A-N-T. So 1:E, 2:L, 3:E, 4:P,5:H,6:A,7:N,8:T. So 👽=e, 🐹=l, 🥶=p, 😇=h, 🐵=a, 🧐=t. Let's check:\n\n👽=e (so word 4: 🐵 e. If 🐵=a, then \"ae\" (a type of tree). Possible. Word 5: 🦆=f, 👽=e, 🥶=p, 🐼=?, 🥵=e, 🐔=s. So f e p [🐼] e s → 6 letters. \"fep...es\". \"fep\" isn't a word. Maybe \"fep\" is part of \"feppet\"? No. Not helpful.\n\nLet's try to look at the sixth word: 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 → [🤥] n [🐵][🤑][🤠]. 5 letters. Let's say it's \"1983\" which is a year. Maybe the sentence is about a year, like \"In 1983...\".\n\nLet's try to reconstruct the entire sentence with the confirmed letters:\n\nEncoded Sentence: 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 🐵👽 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 1983.\n\nWith confirmed: 🐔=s, 🥵=e, 🥺=n, 🦆=f.\n\nSubstituting:\n\nWord1: 🐹😇ss en 😴e🥶\n\nWord2: 🐵🥶😇🤑ns\n\nWord3: 👽🐹e🥶😇🐵e🧐\n\nWord4: 🐵👽\n\nWord5: f👽🥶🐼es\n\nWord6: 🤥n🐵🤑🤠\n\nYear: 1983.\n\nLet's assume the sentence is in English and possibly about an event in 1983. Let's think of possible words. For example, \"In 1983, ...\".\n\nWord4 could be \"in\" (if 🐵=i, 👽=n), but attempt 1 had 🐵=i (False), 👽=n (attempt 2 had 👽=n, which was False).\n\nAlternatively, \"the\" is 3 letters, but word4 is 2 letters. Let's think of word5: f👽🥶🐼es. With 🦆=f, this could be \"forest\" (f-o-r-e-s-t), but 👽=o, 🥶=r, 🐼=e. But 🥵=e, so 🐼 can't be e. So \"forest\" is 6 letters: f-o-r-e-s-t. So 👽=o, 🥶=r, 🐼=e (invalid). So maybe \"fences\" (f-e-n-c-e-s). 👽=e, 🥶=n, 🐼=c. But attempt 3 had 🐼=c (False), so 🐼≠c. So \"fences\" is invalid. \"fenders\": f-e-n-d-e-r-s. 7 letters. No. \"fences\" is 6 letters. \"fences\" would require 🐼=c, which is invalid. So perhaps \"fences\" is not the word.\n\nLet's try to think of word1 again. It's 9 letters: 🐹😇ss en 😴e🥶. Let's say it's \"classroom\" (c-l-a-s-s-r-o-o-m). No, 9 letters. \"classroom\" is c-l-a-s-s-r-o-o-m. So positions 1:c, 2:l, 3:s, 4:s, 5:r, 6:o, 7:o, 8:m. No, doesn't fit. \"lessons\" is 7 letters. \"lessened\" is 8 letters. \"lessening\" is 9 letters: l-e-s-s-e-n-i-n-g. So l (1), e (2), s (3), s (4), e (5), n (6), i (7), n (8), g (9). That fits the structure: 🐹=l, 😇=e, 🐔=s, 🐔=s, 🥵=e, 🥺=n, 😴=i, 🥵=e, 🥶=g. So word1: l e s s e n i e g → \"lessenieg\"? No, that's not a word. Alternatively, \"passenger\" (p-a-s-s-e-n-g-e-r) as before. That would fit: p (1), a (2), s (3), s (4), e (5), n (6), g (7), e (8), r (9). So word1: passenger.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n🐹=p, 😇=a, 😴=g, 🥶=r.\n\nThen word2: 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 → 🐵 r a 🤑 n s. 6 letters: _ r a _ n s. \"barons\" (b-r-a-o-n-s). So 🐵=b, 🤑=o. Then word2: barons.\n\nWord3: 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 → 👽 p e r a b e 🧐. 8 letters. Let's say it's \"spreader\" (s-p-r-e-a-d-e-r). No, 8 letters: s-p-r-e-a-d-e-r. Structure: s (1), p (2), r (3), e (4), a (5), d (6), e (7), r (8). But our word3 has 3rd letter e (🥵=e), 4th letter r (🥶=r), 5th a (😇=a), 6th b (🐵=b), 7th e (🥵=e). So 1:👽, 2:p, 3:e, 4:r, 5:a, 6:b, 7:e, 8:🧐. So \"e p e r a b e ...\" No. Maybe \"keeper\" (k-e-e-p-e-r). No, 6 letters. \"peeper\" (p-e-e-p-e-r). 6 letters. \"peeper\" is p-e-e-p-e-r. So 1:p, 2:e, 3:e, 4:p, 5:e, 6:r. Doesn't fit.\n\nWord4: 🐵👽 → 🐵=b, 👽=?. 2 letters: b ?. Let's say 👽=y. Then word4: by. Common word.\n\nWord5: 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 → f y r 🐼 e s. 6 letters: f y r _ e s. \"fyr...es\". \"fyr\" is a type of fire. \"fyr\" + \"es\" → \"fyres\"? F-Y-R-E-S. 5 letters. \"fyres\" is 5 letters. \"fyres\" would be f-y-r-e-s. So 6 letters: f y r e s. No, 5 letters. \"fyrges\"? No. \"fyrves\"? No.\n\nWord6: 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 → 🤥 n b o 🤠. 5 letters: _ n b o _. Possible words: \"snob...\" \"snobs\" (s-n-o-b-s). No. \"noble\" (n-o-b-l-e). No. \"cobol\" (c-o-b-o-l). No. \"noboo\" (n-o-b-o-o). No. \"lobos\" (l-o-b-o-s). No. \"bobos\" (b-o-b-o-s). No. \"dobos\" (d-o-b-o-s). No. \"mobos\" (m-o-b-o-s). No. \"sobos\" (s-o-b-o-s). No. \"kobos\" (k-o-b-o-s). No. \"tobog\" (t-o-b-o-g). 5 letters. \"tobog\" would be t-o-b-o-g. So 1:t, 2:o, 3:b, 4:o, 5:g. But our word6 is _ n b o _. So 1:?, 2:n, 3:b, 4:o, 5:?. \"nbbo...\" Not helpful.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to list all possible mappings based on the previous correct ones and the structure.\n\nConfirmed:\n\n🐔=s\n\n🥵=e\n\n🥺=n\n\n🦆=f\n\nFrom attempt 3, the correct ones are these, others were wrong. So:\n\nAttempt 3's guesses for other emojis were wrong.

Let's assume it's \"passenger\" (p-a-s-s-e-n-g-e-r). So:\n\n🐹=p (possible, since p not in previous wrong guesses for 🐹)\n\n😇=a (a not in previous wrong guesses for 😇)\n\n😴=g (g not in previous wrong guesses for 😴)\n\n🥶=r (r not in previous wrong guesses for 🥶)\n\nWord 2: 🐵🥶😇🤑ns → 🐵 r a 🤑 n s. 6 letters. Let's assume it's \"barons\" (b-a-r-o-n-s). So:\n\n🐵=b (b not in previous wrong guesses for 🐵)\n\n🤑=o (o not in previous wrong guesses for 🤑)\n\nWord 3: 👽🐹e🥶😇🐵e🧐 → 👽 p e r a b e 🧐. 8 letters. Let's assume it's \"specters\" (s-p-e-c-t-e-r-s). No, 8 letters: s-p-e-c-t-e-r-s. Doesn't fit. Alternatively, \"spenders\" (s-p-e-n-d-e-r-s). 8 letters. s-p-e-n-d-e-r-s. No. Maybe \"spheres\" (s-p-h-e-r-e-s). 7 letters. No. Alternatively, \"speakers\" (s-p-e-a-k-e-r-s). 8 letters. s-p-e-a-k-e-r-s. Structure: s (1), p (2), e (3), a (4), k (5), e (6), r (7), s (8). Our word3 is 👽 (1), p (2), e (3), r (4), a (5), b (6), e (7), 🧐 (8). So 1:👽, 2:p, 3:e, 4:r, 5:a, 6:b, 7:e, 8:🧐. So \"e p e r a b e ...\" No. Let's assume 👽=s, then word3 is s p e r a b e 🧐. Maybe \"sperber\" (s-p-e-r-b-e-r). 7 letters. Close. Maybe the 8th letter is 't', so \"sperbert\". Not a word. Let's proceed.\n\nWord 4: 🐵👽 → 🐵=b, 👽=?. 2 letters. Let's assume 👽=y (y not in previous wrong guesses for 👽). So word4: by.\n\nWord 5: f👽🥶🐼es → f y r 🐼 e s. 6 letters. Let's assume 🐼=d (d not in previous wrong guesses for 🐼). So word5: f y r d e s → \"fyrdes\". \"Fyrd\" is an old English term for a militia, so \"fyrdes\" (plural) could be possible.\n\nWord 6: 🤥n🐵🤑🤠 → 🤥 n b o 🤠. 5 letters. Let's assume 🤥=k (k not in previous wrong guesses for 🤥), 🤠=w (w not in previous wrong guesses for 🤠). So word6: k n b o w → \"knbow\". Not a word, but maybe a name or code. Alternatively, 🤥=t (t not in previous wrong guesses for 🤥), 🤠=x (x not in previous wrong guesses for 🤠). \"tnbox\". No.\n\nAlternatively, let's make a guess with the mappings we have so far, even if some words are not perfect, but following the structure.\n\nSo the guess would be:\n\n🐹=p, 😇=a, 🐔=s, 🥵=e, 🥺=n, 😴=g, 🥶=r, 🐵=b, 👽=y, 🦆=f, 🐼=d, 🤥=k, 🤑=o, 🤠=w, 🧐=t.\n\nLet's check if these letters are unique and not in previous wrong guesses.\n\n🐹=p: p not in previous wrong guesses (b,c,d) → okay.\n\n😇=a: a not in previous wrong guesses (u,o,i) → okay.\n\n🐔=s: confirmed.\n\n🥵=e: confirmed.\n\n🥺=n: confirmed.\n\n😴=g: g not in previous wrong guesses (f,h,b) → okay.\n\n🥶=r: r not in previous wrong guesses (y,s,k) → okay.\n\n🐵=b: b not in previous wrong guesses (i,a,p) → okay.\n\n👽=y: y not in previous wrong guesses (t,n,w) → okay.\n\n🦆=f: confirmed.\n\n🐼=d: d not in previous wrong guesses (l,p,c) → okay.\n\n🤥=k: k not in previous wrong guesses (g,h) → okay.\n\n🤑=o: o not in previous wrong guesses (n,k,g) → okay.\n\n🤠=w: w not in previous wrong guesses (d,t,y) → okay.\n\n🧐=t: t not in previous wrong guesses (s,v) → okay.\n\nAll letters are unique and not in previous wrong guesses. So this could be a valid guess.\n\n\n\nTo solve the Crypto Word Game, we analyze the encoded sentence, confirmed mappings, and previous attempts. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Key Information:\n- **Confirmed Mappings** (from feedback): 🐔=s, 🥵=e, 🥺=n, 🦆=f.\n- **Previous Attempts** ruled out other mappings (e.g., 🐹≠b,c,d; 😇≠u,o,i; etc.).\n- **Encoded Sentence Structure** helps deduce possible words.\n\n### Deductions:\n1. **Word 1 (9 letters):** 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 → Structure: `_ _ s s e n _ e _`. Likely \"passenger\" (p-a-s-s-e-n-g-e-r), so:\n   - 🐹=p (1st letter), 😇=a (2nd), 😴=g (7th), 🥶=r (9th).\n\n2. **Word 2 (6 letters):** 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 → Structure: `_ r a _ n s`. Likely \"barons\" (b-r-a-o-n-s), so:\n   - 🐵=b (1st), 🤑=o (4th).\n\n3. **Word 3 (8 letters):** 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 → Structure: `_ p e r a b e _`. Assuming 👽=y (2-letter word \"by\" in Word 4) and 🧐=t (filler), so:\n   - 👽=y (1st), 🧐=t (8th).\n\n4. **Word 4 (2 letters):** 🐵👽 → `b y` → \"by\".\n\n5. **Word 5 (6 letters):** 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 → Structure: `f y r _ e s`. Assuming 🐼=d (valid letter), so:\n   - 🐼=d (4th).\n\n6. **Word 6 (5 letters):** 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 → Structure: `_ n b o _`. Assuming 🤥=k and 🤠=w (valid letters), so:\n   - 🤥=k (1st), 🤠=w (5th).\n\n### Final Guess:\nAll mappings are unique and avoid previously ruled-out letters.\n\nAnswer: 🐹=p,😇=a,🐔=s,🥵=e,🥺=n,😴=g,🥶=r,🐵=b,👽=y,🦆=f,🐼=d,🤥=k,🤑=o,🤠=w,🧐=t","Okay, let's try to figure out the current guess. First, let's list out all the emojis and their known correct mappings from the history. \n\nLooking at the feedback from each attempt:\n\nAttempt 1: Only 🥵=e is correct.\nAttempt 2: Still only 🥵=e.\nAttempt 3: 🐔=s (True), 🥵=e (True), 🥺=n (True), 🦆=f (True). So from attempt 3, those are correct.\nAttempt 4: The feedback says 🐹=p (True), 😇=a (True), 🐔=s (True), 🥵=e (True), 🥺=n (True), 😴=g (True), 🥶=r (True), 🦆=f (True). So these are all correct now. The ones that are False in attempt 4 are 🐵, 👽, 🐼, 🤥, 🤑, 🤠, 🧐.\n\nSo let's list the known correct mappings so far:\n\n🐹=p (from attempt 4, feedback True)\n😇=a (attempt 4, True)\n🐔=s (attempt 3 and 4, True)\n🥵=e (hint, all attempts True)\n🥺=n (attempt 3 and 4, True)\n😴=g (attempt 4, True)\n🥶=r (attempt 4, True)\n🦆=f (attempt 3 and 4, True)\n\nNow, let's look at the encoded sentence and substitute the known emojis to see what's left.\n\nEncoded Sentence: 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 🐵👽 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 1983.\n\nSubstituting known emojis:\n\nFirst part: 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 → p a s s e n g e r\nSecond part: 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 → [🐵] r a [🤑] n s\nThird part: 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 → [👽] p e r a [🐵] e [🧐]\nFourth part: 🐵👽 → [🐵][👽]\nFifth part: 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 → f [👽] r [🐼] e s\nSixth part: 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 → [🤥] n [🐵][🤑][🤠]\n\nLet's break down each part:\n\n1. p a s s e n g e r → \"passenger\" → that makes sense. So the first word is \"passenger\". Correct.\n\n2. The second word: [🐵] r a [🤑] n s. Let's think of a word that fits the pattern _ r a _ n s. Let's see possible lengths. The word is 6 letters (since there are 6 emojis: 🐵, 🥶, 😇, 🤑, 🥺, 🐔 → 6 characters). So 6 letters: _ r a _ n s. Let's think of 6-letter words ending with \"rans\"? No, \"rans\" is part of it. Let's see: \"branch\" → no. \"trains\"? Let's check: t r a i n s. Oh, \"trains\"! That's 6 letters. t r a i n s. So if [🐵] is t, [🤑] is i. Let's check: 🐵=t, 🤑=i. Then the word would be t r a i n s → \"trains\". That fits.\n\n3. Third word: [👽] p e r a [🐵] e [🧐]. Let's see the length: 👽,🐹,🥵,🥶,😇,🐵,🥵,🧐 → 8 letters. So 8-letter word. The known parts: [👽] p e r a [t] e [🧐] (since if 🐵=t, then [🐵] is t). So the structure is _ p e r a t e _. Let's think of 8-letter words ending with \"perate\". Like \"operate\"? No, \"operate\" is 7 letters. \"cooperate\" → 9 letters. \"separate\"? Let's check: s e p a r a t e. Wait, \"separate\" is 8 letters. Let's see: s p e r a t e ... Wait, \"separate\" is s e p a r a t e. But here, the structure is [👽] p e r a t e [🧐]. Let's check: \"separate\" would be s e p a r a t e. But in our case, the letters are [👽] p e r a t e [🧐]. So first letter [👽], then p, e, r, a, t, e, [🧐]. Let's see: \"stepparent\"? No. Maybe \"generate\"? g e n e r a t e. But that's 8 letters. Let's check: [👽] p e r a t e [🧐]. Hmm. Let's see the next part.\n\n4. Fourth part: 🐵👽 → [t][👽]. So if 🐵=t, then the word is t [👽]. What 2-letter words start with t? \"to\", \"te\", \"tw\", \"th\", \"tr\", \"ti\", \"ta\", \"ts\". Let's think of the previous word. If the third word is [👽] p e r a t e [🧐], and the fourth word is t [👽], perhaps [👽] is h. Then the fourth word would be th (as in \"th\"). Let's see: \"th\" is a possible 2-letter word (as in \"the\", but here it's just \"th\"). Let's check:\n\nIf 👽=h, then the third word becomes h p e r a t e [🧐]. hperate? That doesn't make sense. Maybe 👽=w. Then the fourth word is t w → \"tw\" (as in \"twin\" part). Let's see the fifth part.\n\n5. Fifth part: 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 → f [👽] r [🐼] e s. So the word is f [👽] r [🐼] e s. Let's see, 6 letters. Let's say [👽] is o. Then f o r [🐼] e s. \"forest\"? f o r e s t. But here, it's f o r [🐼] e s. So [🐼] would be t? Then \"forest\" would be f o r t e s? No. \"forges\"? f o r g e s. Oh! f o r g e s. That's 6 letters. So if [🐼] is g, and [👽] is o. Let's check: f o r g e s → \"forges\". That works. So 👽=o, 🐼=g.\n\nThen, the fourth part is 🐵👽 → t o → \"to\". That's a 2-letter word. That fits! So \"to\" is a good candidate.\n\nSo 👽=o, 🐵=t, 🐼=g.\n\nLet's check the fifth part again with these: f (🦆=f) o (👽=o) r (🥶=r) g (🐼=g) e (🥵=e) s (🐔=s) → \"forges\". Perfect!\n\nNow, let's go back to the second part. Second word: 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 → t (🐵=t) r (🥶=r) a (😇=a) [🤑] n (🥺=n) s (🐔=s). So t r a [🤑] n s. If the word is \"trains\", then [🤑] should be i. t r a i n s → \"trains\". That works. So 🤑=i.\n\nThird part: 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 → o (👽=o) p (🐹=p) e (🥵=e) r (🥶=r) a (😇=a) t (🐵=t) e (🥵=e) [🧐]. So o p e r a t e [🧐]. The word would be \"operateX\", where X is the last letter. \"operate\" is 7 letters, but here we have 8 letters. Oh, perhaps \"operates\"? Let's check: o p e r a t e s. That's 8 letters. So [🧐] would be s. So the third word is \"operates\". Let's confirm: o p e r a t e s → \"operates\". Yes! So 🧐=s.\n\nNow, the sixth part: 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 → [🤥] n (🥺=n) t (🐵=t) i (🤑=i) [🤠]. The word is [🤥] n t i [🤠]. Let's think of a 5-letter word here. Maybe \"point\"? p o i n t. No. \"print\"? p r i n t. No. Let's see, the original sentence ends with \"1983\", which is a year. So perhaps the sixth word is a name or a code. Let's see: [🤥] n t i [🤠]. Let's think of \"venti\" (as in Starbucks size), but that's 5 letters: v e n t i. No. Maybe \"plant\"? p l a n t. No. Alternatively, \"hint\" is 4 letters, but here 5. Let's see if there's another possibility. Let's check other parts.\n\nWait, let's check the third part again. If 👽=o, then the third word is o p e r a t e s → \"operates\". That's 8 letters, which matches the 8 emojis (👽,🐹,🥵,🥶,😇,🐵,🥵,🧐). So 8 letters. \"operates\" is 8 letters. So that's correct. So 🧐=s.\n\nNow, let's check the sixth part. Let's think of the entire encoded sentence with known substitutions:\n\nEncoded Sentence after substitution:\n\npassenger trains operates to forges [🤥]nti[🤠] 1983.\n\nWait, \"passenger trains operates to forges [word] 1983.\" That makes sense. The last word before 1983 could be a name, like \"Space\" or something, but let's think. The sixth word is [🤥] n t i [🤠]. Let's see: \"sprint\"? s p r i n t. No. \"brint\"? Not a word. \"trint\"? No. \"kint\"? No. \"hint\" is h i n t, but that's 4 letters. Alternatively, maybe it's \"joint\"? j o i n t. 5 letters. j o i n t. So [🤥]=j, [🤠]=t. Let's check: j o i n t → \"joint\". Then the sixth word would be \"joint\". So \"passenger trains operates to forges joint 1983.\" That could make sense, maybe a model or a project name.\n\nAlternatively, \"point\": p o i n t. [🤥]=p, [🤠]=t. But \"p\" is already taken by 🐹=p. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, \"paint\": p a i n t. But \"a\" is 😇=a. So no. \"mint\": m i n t. So [🤥]=m, [🤠]=t. \"mint\" → m i n t. So [🤥]=m, [🤠]=t. Let's check: m n t i t? No, \"mint\" is m i n t. The sixth word is [🤥] n t i [🤠]. So positions 1: [🤥], 2: n, 3: t, 4: i, 5: [🤠]. So the letters are [1] n t i [5]. Let's think of a 5-letter word with that structure. \"lient\"? No. \"blint\" (a type of pancake): b l i n t. No, the structure here is [1] n t i [5]. \"Brint\"? No. \"Prints\" is 6 letters. \"Tint\" is 4. \"Stint\" (s t i n t): s t i n t. Structure: s t i n t. But here, it's [1] n t i [5]. So position 2 is n, position 3 is t, position 4 is i. So 1: ?, 2: n, 3: t, 4: i, 5: ?. So the word is _ n t i _. Let's think of \"huntin\" (hunting, but that's 7 letters). \"Hinter\" is 6. Maybe \"menti\" (as in mention, but no). \"Centi\" (prefix, c e n t i). Oh! \"centi\" → c e n t i. But that's 5 letters: c e n t i. So the letters would be c (🤥=c), e (but position 2 is n), no. \"Menti\" → m e n t i. So 1: m, 2: e, 3: n, 4: t, 5: i. No. \"Benti\" (name?), b e n t i. Not matching. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sixth word is \"1983\" which is a year, so maybe the previous word is a model number or code. Let's see if there are other possibilities. Let's check the other unknown emojis: 🤥, 🤑, 🤠, 🧐, 🐵, 👽, 🐼. Wait, we already considered:\n\n🐵=t (from the second word being \"trains\"), 👽=o (from fourth word \"to\" and fifth word \"forges\"), 🐼=g (from fifth word \"forges\"), 🤑=i (from second word \"trains\"), 🧐=s (from third word \"operates\").\n\nSo remaining emojis: 🤥 and 🤠. Let's check the sixth word again: 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 → [🤥] n t i [🤠]. So 5 letters: [🤥] n t i [🤠]. Let's think of \"spite\": s p i t e. No. \"Stint\": s t i n t. No. \"Tinto\": t i n t o. No. \"Minto\": m i n t o. That's 5 letters: m i n t o. So [🤥]=m, [🤠]=o. Then the word would be m i n t o. \"Minto\" could be a name. Let's check: \"passenger trains operates to forges Minto 1983.\" That works. So 🤥=m, 🤠=o.\n\nAlternatively, \"Linto\": l i n t o. But that's less common. \"Minto\" is a possible name. Let's go with that.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nKnown emojis:\n\n🐹=p, 😇=a, 🐔=s, 🥵=e, 🥺=n, 😴=g, 🥶=r, 🦆=f (from attempt 4 feedback)\n\nNew guesses:\n\n🐵=t (since second word is \"trains\"), 👽=o (fourth word \"to\", fifth word \"forges\"), 🐼=g (fifth word \"forges\"), 🤑=i (second word \"trains\"), 🧐=s (third word \"operates\"), 🤥=m (sixth word \"Minto\"), 🤠=o (sixth word \"Minto\").\n\nWait, but 👽=o, and if 🤠=o, that's a conflict (each emoji must map to a unique letter). Oh right, emojis must map to unique letters. So 🤠 can't be o if 👽=o. So that's a mistake.\n\nLet me correct that. Let's re-examine the fifth part: 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 → f [👽] r [🐼] e s. If 👽=o, then f o r [🐼] e s. \"Forces\"? f o r c e s. Oh! \"forces\" is 6 letters. f o r c e s. So [🐼]=c. That would make more sense. Let's try that. So 👽=o, 🐼=c. Then fifth word is \"forces\".\n\nFourth part: 🐵👽 → [🐵] o. So 2-letter word: \"go\", \"so\", \"no\", \"lo\", \"to\", \"do\", \"ro\", \"mo\", \"po\", \"ko\". Let's think of \"so\" (s o). If 🐵=s, but 🐔=s (already taken). So can't be. \"to\" (t o). So 🐵=t. Then \"to\" is correct. So 👽=o, 🐵=t, 🐼=c.\n\nThen fifth part: f o r c e s → \"forces\". That's correct.\n\nThird part: 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 → o p e r a t e [🧐]. The word is \"operate\" plus one more letter. 8 letters. \"operates\" is 8 letters (o p e r a t e s). So [🧐]=s. That works. So 🧐=s.\n\nSecond part: 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 → t r a [🤑] n s. \"trains\" (t r a i n s). So 🤑=i.\n\nNow, sixth part: 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 → [🤥] n t i [🤠]. 5 letters. Let's think of \"point\" (p o i n t), but p is taken. \"hint\" (h i n t) is 4 letters. \"mint\" (m i n t) → 4 letters. \"print\" (p r i n t) → 5 letters. p is taken. \"brint\" (not a word). \"trint\" (no). \"spint\" (no). \"stint\" (s t i n t) → 5 letters. s is taken (🐔=s). \"kint\" (no). \"lint\" (l i n t) → 4 letters. \"dint\" (d i n t) → 4 letters. \"gint\" (no). \"hints\" (h i n t s) → 5 letters. But here, the sixth word is [🤥] n t i [🤠]. So positions 1: [🤥], 2: n, 3: t, 4: i, 5: [🤠]. Let's see \"hints\" → h i n t s. No, structure doesn't match. \"Tints\" → t i n t s. No. \"Minto\" → m i n t o. Structure: m i n t o. So [🤥]=m, [🤠]=o. But 👽=o, so o is already taken by 👽. So can't have two emojis mapping to o. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternative approach. Let's check all the words again with knowns:\n\nEncoded sentence after substitution (with knowns):\n\n1. 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 → p a s s e n g e r → \"passenger\" ✔️\n2. 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 → [t] r a [i] n s → \"trains\" ✔️ (if 🐵=t, 🤑=i)\n3. 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 → [o] p e r a [t] e [s] → \"operates\" ✔️ (if 👽=o, 🧐=s)\n4. 🐵👽 → [t][o] → \"to\" ✔️\n5. 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 → f [o] r [c] e s → \"forces\" ✔️ (if 🐼=c)\n6. 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 → [?] n t i [?] → Let's think, maybe \"joint\" → j o i n t. But structure is [?] n t i [?]. \"joint\" is j o i n t → j (position 1), o (position 2), i (position 3), n (position 4), t (position 5). No, that's not matching. \"Pinto\" → p i n t o. p is taken. \"Brint\" → b r i n t. Structure: b r i n t. No. \"Trint\" → t r i n t. t is taken. \"Grin t\" → no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sixth word is \"1983\" and the previous word is a code. Let's think of \"1983\" as a year. Maybe the sentence is \"Passenger trains operate to forces [something] 1983.\" Maybe \"launch\" → but length is 6. \"Start\" → 5 letters. \"start\" → s t a r t. No. \"Begin\" → b e g i n. No. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sixth word is \"1983\" and the previous word is a name like \"Apollo\" but that's 6 letters. \n\nAlternatively, let's check if there are any other possible mappings. Let's check the third word again. If 👽=w, then the third word would be w p e r a t e [s]. \"operates\" would need 👽=o. Maybe 👽=c? Then \"c p e r a t e s\" → \"operates\" doesn't fit. No. \n\nLet's confirm all the mappings we have so far (correct ones from history and new guesses):\n\nFrom attempt 4 feedback, these are correct: 🐹=p, 😇=a, 🐔=s, 🥵=e, 🥺=n, 😴=g, 🥶=r, 🦆=f.\n\nWe need to guess the remaining emojis: 🐵, 👽, 🐼, 🤥, 🤑, 🤠, 🧐.\n\nFrom the analysis:\n\n- The second word is \"trains\" → 🐵=t, 🤑=i.\n- The fourth word is \"to\" → 🐵=t, 👽=o.\n- The fifth word is \"forces\" → 👽=o, 🐼=c.\n- The third word is \"operates\" → 👽=o, 🧐=s.\n- The sixth word: need to find 🤥 and 🤠. Let's assume the sixth word is \"1983\" and the previous word is \"1983\" but that's the year. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, but more likely, we need to find the correct letters.\n\nLet's check the sixth word again. If the sixth word is [🤥] n t i [🤠], and the sentence ends with 1983, maybe it's a code like \"XNTIY\" but that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the sixth word is \"hint\" but that's 4 letters. Alternatively, maybe \"mint\" (m i n t) but that's 4 letters. But our sixth word has 5 letters. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of \"1983\" as part of the sentence. Maybe the full sentence is \"Passenger trains operate to forces [name] 1983.\" For example, \"Passenger trains operate to forces Delta 1983.\" But \"Delta\" is 5 letters: d e l t a. Structure: [🤥] n t i [🤠]. No. \"Gamma\" → g a m m a. No. \"Sigma\" → s i g m a. No. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sixth word is \"1983\" and the previous word is \"Project\" but that's 7 letters. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the fifth word. Let's recheck the fifth part: 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 → f [👽] r [🐼] e s. 6 letters. Possible words: \"forges\" (f o r g e s), \"forces\" (f o r c e s), \"farces\" (f a r c e s) (but 😇=a, so [👽] would be a, but 👽=a? No, because 😇=a already). \"fences\" (f e n c e s) → e is 🥵=e, but [👽] would be e, which is taken. \"furies\" (f u r i e s) → but [👽] would be u, which hasn't been used. Let's check:\n\nIf 👽=u, then fifth word is f u r [🐼] e s. \"furies\" → f u r i e s. So [🐼]=i. But 🤑=i (from \"trains\") → conflict. So no. \"fumes\" (f u m e s) → too short. \"fires\" (f i r e s) → [👽]=i (taken by 🤑=i). No. \n\nBack to \"forces\": f o r c e s. So 👽=o, 🐼=c. That works. Then, the fourth word is \"to\" (t o). So 🐵=t, 👽=o. \n\nThird word: \"operates\" (o p e r a t e s). So 👽=o, 🧐=s. \n\nSecond word: \"trains\" (t r a i n s). So 🐵=t, 🤑=i. \n\nNow, remaining emojis: 🤥 and 🤠. The sixth word is [🤥] n t i [🤠]. Let's think of \"1983\" as the year, and the sixth word could be \"code\" or \"name\". Let's think of \"minty\": m i n t y. Structure: m i n t y. But our sixth word is [🤥] n t i [🤠]. So position 2 is n, position 3 is t, position 4 is i. So 1: [🤥], 2: n, 3: t, 4: i, 5: [🤠]. So the letters are [1] n t i [5]. Let's think of \"pintx\" (a type of food, but not common). \"Tintz\" (no). \"Brint\" (no). \"Prints\" (6 letters). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sixth word is \"1983\" and the previous word is a typo, but more likely, we need to find the correct letters. Let's assume that 🤥=m and 🤠=y. Then the sixth word is \"m n t i y\" → \"mntiy\" (nonsense). Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sixth word is \"1983\" and the previous word is \"1983\" but that's the year. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the third word. Let's check: 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 → [👽] p e r a [🐵] e [🧐]. If 🐵=b (from attempt 4 feedback was False), but attempt 4 guessed 🐵=b and feedback was False, so 🐵≠b. Attempt 3 guessed 🐵=p (False). Attempt 2 guessed 🐵=a (False). Attempt 1 guessed 🐵=i (False). So 🐵 could be t, as we thought. \n\nGiven that, let's proceed with the guesses we have. The required answer must include all emojis, including the hint and previously correct ones. So the answer should list all emojis with their guessed letters, including the correct ones from history and the new guesses.\n\nSo compiling all:\n\n🐹=p (correct from attempt 4)\n😇=a (correct from attempt 4)\n🐔=s (correct from attempt 3 and 4)\n🥵=e (hint, correct)\n🥺=n (correct from attempt 3 and 4)\n😴=g (correct from attempt 4)\n🥶=r (correct from attempt 4)\n🦆=f (correct from attempt 3 and 4)\n🐵=t (new guess)\n👽=o (new guess)\n🐼=c (new guess)\n🤥=m (new guess)\n🤑=i (new guess)\n🤠=y (new guess, assuming)\n🧐=s (new guess)\n\nWait, but 🧐=s: in attempt 1, the guess was 🧐=s (feedback False), attempt 2: 🧐=v (False), attempt 3: 🧐=v (False), attempt 4: 🧐=t (False). So maybe s is possible now. \n\nLet's check if all letters are unique. Let's list the letters:\n\np (🐹), a (😇), s (🐔), e (🥵), n (🥺), g (😴), r (🥶), f (🦆), t (🐵), o (👽), c (🐼), m (🤥), i (🤑), y (🤠), s (🧐). Oh, s is already used by 🐔=s. So 🧐 can't be s. That's a mistake. So 🧐 needs another letter. \n\nThird word: [👽] p e r a [🐵] e [🧐]. If 👽=o, 🐵=t, then it's o p e r a t e [🧐]. 8 letters. What 8-letter word fits? \"operated\" → o p e r a t e d. So [🧐]=d. Then the third word is \"operated\". Let's check: o p e r a t e d → 8 letters. That works. So 🧐=d.\n\nThen, fifth part: 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 → f o r [🐼] e s. \"forces\" → f o r c e s. So 🐼=c. Correct.\n\nFourth part: 🐵👽 → t o → \"to\". Correct.\n\nSecond part: 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 → t r a i n s → \"trains\". So 🤑=i. Correct.\n\nThird part: o p e r a t e d → \"operated\". So 🧐=d. Correct.\n\nSixth part: 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 → [🤥] n t i [🤠]. Let's think of \"point\" → p o i n t (p is taken). \"hunt\" → h u n t (4 letters). \"mint\" → m i n t (4 letters). \"print\" → p r i n t (p taken). \"brint\" (no). \"stint\" → s t i n t (s taken). \"dint\" → d i n t (4 letters). \"kint\" (no). \"lint\" → l i n t (4 letters). \"gint\" (no). \"tint\" → t i n t (t taken). \n\nAlternatively, \"1983\" is the year, so maybe the sixth word is \"code\" → c o d e (4 letters). No. \"name\" → n a m e (4 letters). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sixth word is \"1983\" and the previous word is \"Project\" → but that's 7 letters. \n\nAlternatively, let's assume that the sixth word is \"1983\" and the previous word is a typo, but we need to guess. Let's pick 🤥=b and 🤠=k. So the sixth word is \"b n t i k\" → \"bntik\" (nonsense). Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sixth word is \"link\" → l i n k (4 letters). No. \n\nGiven time constraints, I'll proceed with the best possible guesses based on the analysis.\n\nTo solve this Crypto Word Game, we analyze the encoded sentence, feedback history, and hint to deduce the correct emoji-letter mappings. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\n### Known Correct Mappings (from History):\n- **🥵=e** (given hint, confirmed in all attempts).\n- **🐔=s, 🥺=n, 🦆=f** (confirmed in Attempt 3).\n- **🐹=p, 😇=a, 😴=g, 🥶=r** (confirmed in Attempt 4).\n\n\n### Deductions for Remaining Emojis:\n1. **First Word**: 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 → \"passenger\" (p-a-s-s-e-n-g-e-r). Confirms known mappings.\n2. **Second Word**: 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 → Structure: _-r-a-_-n-s. Likely \"trains\" (t-r-a-i-n-s). Thus:\n   - 🐵=t (2nd word's first letter).\n   - 🤑=i (2nd word's 4th letter).\n3. **Fourth Word**: 🐵👽 → Structure: t-_. Likely \"to\" (t-o). Thus:\n   - 👽=o (4th word's second letter).\n4. **Fifth Word**: 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 → Structure: f-o-r-_-e-s. Likely \"forces\" (f-o-r-c-e-s). Thus:\n   - 🐼=c (5th word's 4th letter).\n5. **Third Word**: 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 → Structure: o-p-e-r-a-t-e-_. Likely \"operated\" (o-p-e-r-a-t-e-d). Thus:\n   - 🧐=d (3rd word's 8th letter).\n6. **Sixth Word**: 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 → Structure: _-n-t-i-_. Assuming a plausible 5-letter word (e.g., \"minty\" → m-n-t-i-y, though not a standard word, but fits the structure). Thus:\n   - 🤥=m (6th word's 1st letter).\n   - 🤠=y (6th word's 5th letter).\n\n\n### Final Mappings:\nAll emojis are mapped to unique letters, including previously confirmed ones and new deductions.\n\n\nAnswer: 🐹=p,😇=a,🐔=s,🥵=e,🥺=n,😴=g,🥶=r,🐵=t,👽=o,🦆=f,🐼=c,🤥=m,🤑=i,🤠=y,🧐=d","Okay, let's try to figure out the current guess. First, let's look at the history and feedback to track which emojis are already correct. \n\nThe hint is 🥵=e, which was confirmed in all attempts. Let's go through each attempt's feedback:\n\nAttempt 1: Only 🥵=e is correct.\nAttempt 2: Still only 🥵=e.\nAttempt 3: 🐔=s, 🥵=e, 🥺=n, 🦆=f are correct.\nAttempt 4: Now, 🐹=p, 😇=a, 🐔=s, 🥵=e, 🥺=n, 😴=g, 🥶=r, 🦆=f are correct (since feedback says these are True). The others (🐵, 👽, 🐼, 🤥, 🤑, 🤠, 🧐) are False here.\nAttempt 5: Feedback shows 🐹=p (True), 😇=a (True), 🐔=s (True), 🥵=e (True), 🥺=n (True), 😴=g (True), 🥶=r (True), 🐵=t (True), 👽=o (True), 🦆=f (True), 🤑=i (True), 🧐=d (True). The only False ones here are 🐼 and 🤠.\n\nSo let's list the confirmed correct ones from attempt 5:\n- 🐹=p (True)\n- 😇=a (True)\n- 🐔=s (True)\n- 🥵=e (True)\n- 🥺=n (True)\n- 😴=g (True)\n- 🥶=r (True)\n- 🐵=t (True)\n- 👽=o (True)\n- 🦆=f (True)\n- 🤑=i (True)\n- 🧐=d (True)\n- 🤥: Still False in attempt 5.\n- 🐼: Still False in attempt 5.\n- 🤠: Still False in attempt 5.\n\nNow, let's check the encoded sentence with the confirmed letters to see if it makes sense. Let's substitute each emoji with their confirmed letters:\n\nEncoded Sentence: 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 🐵👽 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 1983.\n\nSubstituting:\np a s s e n g e r   t r a i n s   o p e r a t e d   t o   f o r [🐼] e s   [🤥] n t i [🤠] 1983.\n\nLet's break it down word by word:\n\n1. 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 → p a s s e n g e r → \"passenger\" (makes sense)\n2. 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 → t r a i n s → \"trains\" (correct)\n3. 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 → o p e r a t e d → \"operated\" (correct)\n4. 🐵👽 → t o → \"to\" (correct)\n5. 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 → f o r [🐼] e s → Let's see. The word is \"for [X]es\". Possible words: \"forces\" (f o r c e s) → so [🐼] would be c. Let's check if that makes sense. \"forces\" → f o r c e s. So if 🐼=c, then this word is \"forces\".\n6. 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 → [🤥] n t i [🤠] → Let's see. The word before 1983. Maybe \"built in 1983\"? Let's see: \"built\" is b u i l t. But the structure here is [🤥] n t i [🤠]. Let's see: \"built\" would be b u i l t. But the letters here are [🤥] n t i [🤠]. Let's see: \"point\" → p o i n t, but that doesn't fit. \"print\" → p r i n t. No. \"joint\" → j o i n t. \"hint\" → h i n t. Wait, the structure is [🤥] n t i [🤠]. Let's reverse: i is from 🤑=i, so the letters are [🤥], n, t, i, [🤠]. So the word is [🤥]nti[🤠]. Let's think of 5-letter words ending with i? Maybe \"built\" → but \"built\" is b u i l t. Hmm. Alternatively, \"pilot\" → p i l o t. No. Let's look at the sentence. The full sentence would be \"Passenger trains operated to forces [something] 1983.\" Maybe \"built in 1983\" → but \"built\" would need to be [🤥]n t i[🤠]. Let's see \"built\" is b u i l t. So [🤥] is b, [🤠] is l. Then \"b u i l t\" → b n t i l? No, that's not matching. Wait, the letters are [🤥], n, t, i, [🤠]. So positions 1: [🤥], 2: n, 3: t, 4: i, 5: [🤠]. What 5-letter word has n as the second letter, t as third, i as fourth? Let's think: \"pinto\" (p i n t o) no. \"menti\" (m e n t i) → maybe \"menti\" but not a common word. \"benti\" (b e n t i) → no. Alternatively, \"hint\" is 4 letters. \"pint\" (4 letters). Maybe \"built\" is 5 letters: b u i l t. But the letters here are [🤥] n t i [🤠]. Let's check the fifth attempt's feedback: attempt 5 guessed 🐼=c, which was False. So maybe in attempt 5, they guessed 🐼=c, but it was wrong. Let's see: attempt 5's guess for 🐼 was c, feedback was False. So maybe in attempt 5, the guess for 🐼 was c, but it's not correct. So let's check the fifth word again: 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 → f o r [🐼] e s. What 6-letter word starts with for, ends with es. \"Forces\" is 6 letters (f o r c e s) → so if [🐼] is c, then it's forces. But in attempt 5, the guess was 🐼=c, and feedback was False. So maybe that's not right. Let's think of other possibilities. \"Forges\" → f o r g e s. Then [🐼] would be g. But in attempt 4, 😴=g was correct (feedback True), so 🐼 can't be g. \"Forges\" is f o r g e s. \"Fores\" is 5 letters. \"Forest\" is 6 letters, but ends with t. \"Foges\" → no. \"Floes\" → f l o e s, but that's 5 letters. \"Fumes\" → f u m e s, no. \"Fires\" → f i r e s. No, because the third letter is r (🥶=r). So \"for\" + [x] + \"es\". Maybe \"forges\" (f o r g e s), but that would need 🐼=g. But 😴=g is already correct. So that's not possible. Alternatively, \"forces\" (f o r c e s) → c. If attempt 5 guessed 🐼=c and got False, maybe the correct is different. Let's check the next word. The sixth word: 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 → [🤥] n t i [🤠]. Let's see. If the sentence is \"Passenger trains operated to [something] 1983.\" Maybe \"built in 1983\" → but \"built\" would need to be 5 letters. Let's see: \"built\" is b u i l t. So [🤥] is b, [🤠] is l. Then the word would be b n t i l? No, that's \"bntil\" which isn't a word. Alternatively, \"pilot\" → p i l o t. No. \"Print\" → p r i n t. No. \"Brick\" → no. Let's check the fifth attempt's feedback for 🤠: attempt 5 guessed 🤠=y, feedback was False. So maybe in attempt 5, the guess for 🤠 was y. Let's think of other possibilities. Let's check the fifth attempt's guesses and feedback again. Attempt 5's guess: 🐼=c (False), 🤥=m (False), 🤑=i (True), 🤠=y (False), 🧐=d (True). So the remaining emojis to solve are 🐼, 🤥, 🤠.\n\nLet's look at the fifth word again: 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 → f o r [🐼] e s. Let's see, 6 letters. Let's think of words like \"forces\" (f o r c e s) which would make 🐼=c. But attempt 5 guessed 🐼=c and it was wrong. So maybe not. \"Forges\" (f o r g e s) → 🐼=g, but 😴=g is already taken. \"Floors\" → f l o o r s. No, because the letters are f o r [x] e s. \"Floes\" is f l o e s (5 letters). \"Fumes\" is f u m e s. No. \"Fires\" is f i r e s. No. \"Faces\" → f a c e s. No, because the third letter is r (🥶=r). \"Fares\" → f a r e s. That's 5 letters. So \"for [x]es\" → 6 letters. Maybe \"forkes\"? No. \"Forces\" is the most likely. If attempt 5's guess for 🐼=c was wrong, perhaps there's a mistake. Let's check the feedback for attempt 5 again. The feedback says 🐼: False. So maybe in attempt 5, the user guessed 🐼=c, but the correct is different. Let's check other possibilities. Let's think of the fourth word: 🐵👽 → t o → \"to\". Correct. Third word: 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 → o p e r a t e d → \"operated\". Correct. Second word: 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 → t r a i n s → \"trains\". Correct. First word: 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 → p a s s e n g e r → \"passenger\". Correct. \n\nThe fifth word: 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 → f o r [x] e s. Let's think of \"forces\" again. If the user in attempt 5 guessed 🐼=c, but the feedback was False, perhaps they made a mistake. Wait, let's check the attempt 5's feedback again. The feedback says 🐼: False. So the guess for 🐼 in attempt 5 was c, and it's incorrect. So perhaps the correct value for 🐼 is something else. Let's think of another 6-letter word. Maybe \"fortes\" (f o r t e s). That would make [x] = t. But 🐵=t is already correct (from attempt 5's feedback: 🐵=t is True). So 🐼 can't be t. \"Frotes\"? No. \"Forges\" (as before) but 🐼=g is taken by 😴=g. \"Flores\" (f l o r e s) → but the third letter is r (🥶=r), so \"for\" part. \"Flores\" would be f l o r e s. But the structure here is f o r [x] e s. So the third letter is r (from 🥶=r). So \"for [x]es\". Maybe \"forges\" → no. Let's think of \"forges\" again. Maybe the user's guess in attempt 5 for 🐼 was wrong. Let's move to the sixth word. 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 → [🤥] n t i [🤠]. Let's think of \"built\" again. If the word is \"built\", then letters are b u i l t. But the structure here is [🤥] n t i [🤠]. So the second letter is n. \"Built\" has u as the second letter. So that's not. What about \"point\"? p o i n t. Structure: [🤥] n t i [🤠]. \"Point\" is p o i n t. So letters 1: p, 2: o, 3: i, 4: n, 5: t. No. \"Print\": p r i n t. Structure: [🤥] n t i [🤠]. \"Print\" is p r i n t. So 1: p, 2: r, 3: i, 4: n, 5: t. No. \"Hints\": h i n t s. No, 5 letters. \"Bindi\": b i n d i. No. \"Minty\": m i n t y. Structure: [🤥] n t i [🤠]. \"Minty\" is m i n t y. So 1: m, 2: i, 3: n, 4: t, 5: y. No. \"Tinto\": t i n t o. No. Let's think of the sentence again. The full sentence with known words: \"Passenger trains operated to [f o r X e s] [Y n t i Z] 1983.\" Maybe \"Passenger trains operated to forces built 1983.\" But \"built\" would need to be 5 letters, but \"built\" is 5 letters. Let's see: \"built\" is b u i l t. So [Y] would be b, [Z] would be l. So the sixth word would be b n t i l? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, \"Passenger trains operated to forces in 1983.\" But \"in\" is two letters, but the sixth word is five letters. Maybe \"Passenger trains operated to forces during 1983.\" No, \"during\" is 6 letters. Alternatively, \"Passenger trains operated to forces made 1983.\" No. Let's think of the fifth word again. If the fifth word is \"forces\", then 🐼=c. Maybe the feedback in attempt 5 was a mistake, but according to the problem, the feedback is accurate. So the user guessed 🐼=c in attempt 5, and it was wrong. So perhaps 🐼 is another letter. Let's think of \"forges\" (f o r g e s), which would require 🐼=g. But 😴=g is already correct. So that's not possible. \"Floors\" (f l o o r s) → but the structure is f o r [x] e s. \"Floors\" is f l o o r s, which would be f l o o r s, but the third letter here is r (from 🥶=r). So \"for\" part. \"Floors\" would be f l o o r s, which is 6 letters, but the structure is f o r [x] e s. So \"for\" followed by [x], then \"es\". \"Floors\" is f l o o r s. So \"for\" would be the first three letters (f o r), but \"floors\" is f l o o r s, which is different. Let's try another approach. Let's list all the emojis and their current status:\n\n- 🐹=p (True)\n- 😇=a (True)\n- 🐔=s (True)\n- 🥵=e (True)\n- 🥺=n (True)\n- 😴=g (True)\n- 🥶=r (True)\n- 🐵=t (True)\n- 👽=o (True)\n- 🦆=f (True)\n- 🤑=i (True)\n- 🧐=d (True)\n- 🐼: ? (attempt 5 guessed c → False)\n- 🤥: ? (attempt 5 guessed m → False)\n- 🤠: ? (attempt 5 guessed y → False)\n\nNow, let's look at the fifth word again: 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 → f o r [🐼] e s. Let's think of 6-letter words. Let's see: \"forces\" (f o r c e s) → 🐼=c. If attempt 5 guessed 🐼=c and it's False, maybe it's another letter. Let's think of \"fortes\" (f o r t e s). Then 🐼=t, but 🐵=t is already correct, so no. \"Frolic\" → no. \"Frozes\" (f r o z e s) → but the second letter is o (👽=o), so \"for\" not \"fro\". \"Frozes\" is f r o z e s, which would start with \"fro\", but the second emoji is 👽=o, so \"f o r\". So \"for\". Let's think of \"forges\" again. \"Forges\" is f o r g e s. So [🐼]=g, but 😴=g is already correct, so no. \"Folios\" → f o l i o s. No, the structure is f o r [x] e s. \"Folios\" is f o l i o s. Not matching. \"Fishes\" → f i s h e s. No. \"Fences\" → f e n c e s. No. \"Fancies\" → f a n c i e s. No. \"Forges\" is the only one that comes to mind, but 🐼=g is taken. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fifth word is \"forests\", but that's 7 letters. \"Forest\" is 6 letters (f o r e s t), but the structure here is 6 letters (f o r [x] e s). \"Forest\" would be f o r e s t, which is 6 letters. But the structure here is 6 letters: positions 1:f, 2:o, 3:r, 4:[x], 5:e, 6:s. So \"forest\" is f o r e s t. That's 6 letters, but the sixth letter is t, but here the sixth emoji is 🐔=s. So the sixth letter is s, so \"forest\" ends with t, which doesn't match. So \"forest\" is not. \n\nLet's check the sixth word again. 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 → [🤥] n t i [🤠]. Let's think of \"built\" again. \"Built\" is b u i l t. The letters here are [🤥] n t i [🤠]. So \"built\" would be b u i l t. The second letter is u, but here it's n. So no. \"Print\" is p r i n t. The letters here are [🤥] n t i [🤠]. \"Print\" is p r i n t. Second letter r, third i, fourth n, fifth t. Doesn't match. \"Pinto\" → p i n t o. Structure: [🤥] n t i [🤠]. \"Pinto\" is p i n t o. So 1:p, 2:i, 3:n, 4:t, 5:o. No. \"Hindi\" → h i n d i. Structure: [🤥] n t i [🤠]. \"Hindi\" is h i n d i. 1:h, 2:i, 3:n, 4:d, 5:i. No. \"Mindi\" → m i n d i. No. \"Bindi\" → b i n d i. No. \"Tindi\" → t i n d i. No. \"Kindi\" → k i n d i. No. \n\nMaybe the sixth word is \"joint\". \"Joint\" is j o i n t. Structure: [🤥] n t i [🤠]. \"Joint\" is j o i n t. So 1:j, 2:o, 3:i, 4:n, 5:t. No. \"Point\" → p o i n t. 1:p, 2:o, 3:i, 4:n, 5:t. No. \"Hint\" → h i n t. 4 letters. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sixth word is \"brink\". \"Brink\" is b r i n k. Structure: [🤥] n t i [🤠]. No. \"Brunt\" → b r u n t. No. \n\nLet's think of the entire sentence. \"Passenger trains operated to [f o r X e s] [Y n t i Z] 1983.\" Maybe it's \"Passenger trains operated to forces made 1983.\" But \"made\" is 4 letters, and the sixth word is 5 letters. \"Made\" would be m a d e. No. \"Built\" is 5 letters. \"Built\" is b u i l t. So if the sixth word is \"built\", then [Y] is b, [Z] is l. So the sixth word would be b n t i l. That's \"bntil\" which isn't a word. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fifth word is \"floors\". \"Floors\" is f l o o r s. Structure: f o r [x] e s. No, because \"floors\" is f l o o r s. The second emoji is 👽=o, so \"f o r\". \"Floors\" would be f l o o r s, which starts with \"flo\", not \"for\". \n\nLet's check the fifth attempt's feedback again. Attempt 5's feedback says 🐼: False, 🤥: False, 🤠: False. The rest are True. So the correct answer must include all the previously correct emojis (from attempt 5's True feedback) plus the new guesses for 🐼, 🤥, 🤠. \n\nLet's try to think of the fifth word again. \"f o r [x] e s\" → 6 letters. Let's think of \"forces\" again. If the user guessed 🐼=c in attempt 5 and it was wrong, maybe there's a typo, but according to the problem, feedback is correct. So maybe 🐼 is a different letter. Let's think of \"foces\" → no. \"Foves\" → f o v e s (5 letters). No. \"Foges\" → f o g e s (5 letters). No. \"Fokes\" → no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fifth word is \"forges\". \"Forges\" is f o r g e s. So [x] = g. But 😴=g is already correct (from attempt 4's feedback: 😴=g is True). So 🐼 can't be g. \n\nLet's think of the sixth word. If the sixth word is \"built\", then the letters would be [🤥] n t i [🤠] = b u i l t. But the second letter is n, which doesn't match u. So that's not. Maybe \"hindi\"? [🤥] n t i [🤠] = h i n d i. No. \"Print\" → p r i n t. No. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sixth word is \"minty\". \"Minty\" is m i n t y. Structure: [🤥] n t i [🤠]. So 1:m, 2:i, 3:n, 4:t, 5:y. No. \n\nLet's try to think of possible letters for the remaining emojis. The English alphabet has 26 letters. Let's list the used letters so far:\n\nUsed letters from confirmed emojis:\np (🐹), a (😇), s (🐔), e (🥵), n (🥺), g (😴), r (🥶), t (🐵), o (👽), f (🦆), i (🤑), d (🧐). So used letters: a, d, e, f, g, i, n, o, p, r, s, t.\n\nRemaining letters: b, c, h, j, k, l, m, q, u, v, w, x, y, z.\n\nSo possible letters for 🐼, 🤥, 🤠 are from these.\n\nLet's look at the fifth word again: f o r [x] e s. Let's see, 6 letters. Let's try \"forces\" again. [x] = c. c is in the remaining letters. So if 🐼=c, then that's possible. Even if attempt 5 guessed 🐼=c and got False, maybe there's a mistake. Let's check. The fifth attempt's guess was 🐼=c, feedback was False. So the user thought it was c, but it's not. So what else?\n\nAnother possibility: \"fortes\" (f o r t e s). [x] = t. But t is already used (🐵=t). So no. \"Frolic\" → no. \"Frozes\" (f r o z e s). Structure: f o r [x] e s. \"Frozes\" is f r o z e s. So the second letter is r, but 👽=o, so \"f o r\", not \"f r o\". So no. \n\nLet's think of \"fences\" (f e n c e s). No, because the third letter is r (from 🥶=r). \n\nAnother approach: Let's check the fifth word's length. It's 6 letters (🦆=f, 👽=o, 🥶=r, 🐼=?, 🥵=e, 🐔=s → 6 letters). So 6 letters: f o r ? e s. Let's check a dictionary for 6-letter words starting with 'for' and ending with 'es'. \n\nLooking up 6-letter words starting with 'for' and ending with 'es':\n\n- Forges (f o r g e s) → g is used (😴=g)\n- Forces (f o r c e s) → c is available (not used yet)\n- Fortes (f o r t e s) → t is used (🐵=t)\n- Forjes (not a word)\n- Fornes (not a word)\n- Forges is valid, but g is used. Forces is valid, c is available. So perhaps 🐼=c. Even though attempt 5 guessed c and got False, maybe that's a mistake, or perhaps I'm missing something. \n\nAssuming that the fifth word is \"forces\", then 🐼=c. Then, the sixth word: [🤥] n t i [🤠]. Let's think of \"built\" again. If the sixth word is \"built\", then [🤥] = b, [🤠] = l. So \"built\" is b u i l t. But the structure is [🤥] n t i [🤠]. So the second letter is n, but \"built\" has u. So that's not. Let's think of \"brink\" (b r i n k). No. \"Brunt\" (b r u n t). No. \"Bindi\" (b i n d i). No. \n\nAlternatively, the sixth word could be \"mints\" (m i n t s), but that's 5 letters. The sixth word is 5 letters (🤥, 🥺=n, 🐵=t, 🤑=i, 🤠). So 5 letters: [🤥] n t i [🤠]. Let's think of \"pints\" (p i n t s). Structure: [🤥] n t i [🤠]. \"Pints\" is p i n t s. So 1:p (used by 🐹=p), 2:i (used by 🤑=i), 3:n (used by 🥺=n), 4:t (used by 🐵=t), 5:s (used by 🐔=s). So \"pints\" would have all letters already used, so that's not possible. \n\nAnother possibility: \"hints\" (h i n t s). Structure: [🤥] n t i [🤠]. \"Hints\" is h i n t s. So 1:h, 2:i, 3:n, 4:t, 5:s. So [🤥]=h, [🤠]=s. But s is already used by 🐔=s. So [🤠]=s is not possible. \n\nLet's think of \"bindi\" (b i n d i). Structure: [🤥] n t i [🤠]. \"Bindi\" is b i n d i. 1:b, 2:i, 3:n, 4:d, 5:i. So [🤥]=b, [🤠]=i. But i is used by 🤑=i. \n\nWhat about \"kinds\" (k i n d s). Structure: [🤥] n t i [🤠]. \"Kinds\" is k i n d s. 1:k, 2:i, 3:n, 4:d, 5:s. So [🤥]=k, [🤠]=s. s is used. \n\nMaybe \"minds\" (m i n d s). 1:m, 2:i, 3:n, 4:d, 5:s. So [🤥]=m, [🤠]=s. s is used. \n\nAlternatively, \"brine\" (b r i n e). No, 5 letters. \n\nLet's think of the entire sentence again. \"Passenger trains operated to forces [something] 1983.\" Maybe \"Passenger trains operated to forces in 1983.\" But \"in\" is two letters, and the sixth word is five letters. \n\nAlternatively, \"Passenger trains operated to forces built 1983.\" But \"built\" is five letters. \"Built\" is b u i l t. So [🤥]=b, [🤠]=l. Then the sixth word would be b n t i l. That's \"bntil\", which is not a word. \n\nAlternatively, \"Passenger trains operated to forces made 1983.\" \"Made\" is four letters. \n\nAlternatively, \"Passenger trains operated to forces came 1983.\" \"Came\" is four letters. \n\nHmm. Maybe the sixth word is \"built\" even if it doesn't fit. Let's try to guess 🐼=c, 🤥=b, 🤠=l. \n\nSo the current guess would be all the confirmed emojis plus the new ones:\n\n🐹=p, 😇=a, 🐔=s, 🥵=e, 🥺=n, 😴=g, 🥶=r, 🐵=t, 👽=o, 🦆=f, 🤑=i, 🧐=d, 🐼=c, 🤥=b, 🤠=l.\n\nLet's check if these letters are all unique. The used letters are a, b, c, d, e, f, g, i, l, n, o, p, r, s, t. All unique. \n\nSo the final answer would include all these.\n\nTo solve this Crypto Word Game, we analyze the provided history, feedback, and encoded sentence to determine the correct emoji-letter mappings. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Confirmed Mappings (from Attempt 5 Feedback):\n- **🐹=p** (True)\n- **😇=a** (True)\n- **🐔=s** (True)\n- **🥵=e** (True, given as a hint)\n- **🥺=n** (True)\n- **😴=g** (True)\n- **🥶=r** (True)\n- **🐵=t** (True)\n- **👽=o** (True)\n- **🦆=f** (True)\n- **🤑=i** (True)\n- **🧐=d** (True)\n\n### Unconfirmed Mappings (to be inferred):\nThe remaining emojis are **🐼**, **🤥**, and **🤠**. We use the encoded sentence to deduce these:\n\n1. **Encoded Sentence Segment: 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔**  \n   Substituting confirmed mappings: `f o r [🐼] e s`. This 6-letter word is likely \"forces\" (f o r c e s), so **🐼=c**.\n\n2. **Encoded Sentence Segment: 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠**  \n   Substituting confirmed mappings: `[🤥] n t i [🤠]`. This 5-letter word is likely \"built\" (b u i l t), but adjusting for the structure `[🤥] n t i [🤠]`, we infer **🤥=b** and **🤠=l** (though \"bntil\" is not a standard word, this is the best fit given constraints).\n\n### Final Mappings:\nAll confirmed mappings plus the inferred ones for the remaining emojis.\n\nAnswer: 🐹=p,😇=a,🐔=s,🥵=e,🥺=n,😴=g,🥶=r,🐵=t,👽=o,🦆=f,🐼=c,🤥=b,🤑=i,🤠=l,🧐=d","Okay, let's try to figure out the remaining emojis. First, let's list out what we know from the history. \n\nThe feedback from previous attempts shows which emojis are correct. Let's go through each attempt's feedback to collect the correct mappings.\n\nFrom Attempt 1: Only 🥵=e is correct (since the hint is that, and feedback confirms it). \n\nAttempt 2: Again, only 🥵=e is correct.\n\nAttempt 3: Feedback says 🐔=s, 🥵=e, 🥺=n, 🦆=f are correct. So 🐔=s, 🥺=n, 🦆=f.\n\nAttempt 4: Feedback shows 🐹=p (True), 😇=a (True), 🐔=s (True), 🥵=e (True), 🥺=n (True), 😴=g (True), 🥶=r (True), 🦆=f (True). So those are correct now.\n\nAttempt 5: Feedback here includes 🐹=p (True), 😇=a (True), 🐔=s (True), 🥵=e (True), 🥺=n (True), 😴=g (True), 🥶=r (True), 🐵=t (True), 👽=o (True), 🦆=f (True), 🤑=i (True), 🧐=d (True). So now we know 🐵=t, 👽=o, 🤑=i, 🧐=d.\n\nAttempt 6: Feedback here adds that 🤠=l (True) because 🤠 was guessed as l and feedback says True. Also, 🤥 is still False, 🐼 is still False.\n\nSo let's list all the correct mappings so far:\n\n- 🐹=p (from attempt 4)\n- 😇=a (attempt 4)\n- 🐔=s (attempt 3, 4)\n- 🥵=e (hint, all attempts)\n- 🥺=n (attempt 3, 4)\n- 😴=g (attempt 4)\n- 🥶=r (attempt 4)\n- 🐵=t (attempt 5)\n- 👽=o (attempt 5)\n- 🦆=f (attempt 3, 4, 5)\n- 🤑=i (attempt 5)\n- 🧐=d (attempt 5)\n- 🤠=l (attempt 6)\n\nThe remaining emojis are 🐼 and 🤥. Let's look at the encoded sentence to see where they appear.\n\nEncoded Sentence: 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 🐵👽 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 1983.\n\nLet's substitute the known emojis:\n\nFirst part: 🐹=p, 😇=a, 🐔=s, 🐔=s, 🥵=e, 🥺=n, 😴=g, 🥵=e, 🥶=r → \"passenger\" (p a s s e n g e r) → that makes sense. So first word is \"passenger\".\n\nSecond word: 🐵=t, 🥶=r, 😇=a, 🤑=i, 🥺=n, 🐔=s → \"train s\"? Wait, t r a i n s → \"trains\". Oh right, \"trains\".\n\nThird word: 👽=o, 🐹=p, 🥵=e, 🥶=r, 😇=a, 🐵=t, 🥵=e, 🧐=d → \"op erated\"? o p e r a t e d → \"operated\".\n\nFourth word: 🐵=t, 👽=o → \"to\".\n\nFifth word: 🦆=f, 👽=o, 🥶=r, 🐼=?, 🥵=e, 🐔=s → \"for?es\". Let's see. The word is \"forXes\". What could X be? Maybe \"forces\"? f o r c e s. Oh, \"forces\" would fit. So 🐼=c. Let's check. If 🐼=c, then the word becomes \"forces\" (f o r c e s). That works.\n\nSixth word: 🤥=?, 🥺=n, 🐵=t, 🤑=i, 🤠=l → \"?ntil\". What word is that? \"Until\" is u n t i l. So if the word is \"until\", then 🤥=u. Let's check. \"until\" → u n t i l. So 🤥=u.\n\nLet's verify all the substitutions now:\n\nEncoded Sentence substitution:\n\n1. 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 → p a s s e n g e r → \"passenger\" ✔️\n2. 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 → t r a i n s → \"trains\" ✔️\n3. 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 → o p e r a t e d → \"operated\" ✔️\n4. 🐵👽 → t o → \"to\" ✔️\n5. 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 → f o r c e s → \"forces\" ✔️ (so 🐼=c)\n6. 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 → u n t i l → \"until\" ✔️ (so 🤥=u)\n7. 1983 remains as is.\n\nThat makes the full sentence: \"passenger trains operated to forces until 1983.\" Wait, \"forces\" might need context, but \"operated to forces until 1983\" could make sense, maybe \"operated for forces until 1983\"? But the fifth word substitution gives \"forXes\", which with X=c becomes \"forces\". Let's check again. The fifth word is 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔: 🦆=f, 👽=o, 🥶=r, 🐼=c, 🥵=e, 🐔=s → \"forces\". That's correct. The sixth word is 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠: 🤥=u, 🥺=n, 🐵=t, 🤑=i, 🤠=l → \"until\". So the full sentence would be: \"Passenger trains operated to forces until 1983.\" That makes sense as a possible sentence, maybe referring to a historical event where passenger trains were operated for or to forces until 1983.\n\nSo the remaining emojis are 🐼 and 🤥. From the analysis, 🐼=c and 🤥=u. Let's check if these fit with the previous feedback. \n\nIn attempt 5, 🐼 was guessed as c, and the feedback was False. Wait, attempt 5's guess was 🐼=c, and feedback said {'🐼': False}. Oh, that's a problem. Let's check. Attempt 5's guess: 🐼=c. Feedback says 🐼: False. So that can't be right. So maybe my earlier assumption is wrong.\n\nLet me check attempt 5 again. Attempt 5's guess includes 🐼=c. The feedback for attempt 5 was: {'🐹': True, '😇': True, '🐔': True, '🥵': True, '🥺': True, '😴': True, '🥶': True, '🐵': True, '👽': True, '🦆': True, '🐼': False, '🤥': False, '🤑': True, '🤠': False, '🧐': True}. So 🐼=c was incorrect.\n\nAttempt 6's guess was 🐼=c again? Let me check attempt 6. Attempt 6's guess: 🐼=c. Feedback: {'🐼': False}. So 🐼=c is wrong.\n\nSo what's the fifth word then? Let's re-examine. The fifth word is 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔. We know 🦆=f, 👽=o, 🥶=r, 🥵=e, 🐔=s. So it's \"f o r [🐼] e s\". So the structure is \"for_e_s\". Let's think of 6-letter words starting with \"for\" and ending with \"es\". Possible words: \"forces\" (6 letters, but that's \"f o r c e s\" → 6 letters. But if 🐼=c is wrong, then what? \"forges\" (f o r g e s). If 🐼=g, then \"forges\". Let's check. If 🐼=g, then the word is \"forges\". That's possible.\n\nBut let's check the sixth word again. The sixth word is 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠: [🤥] n t i l. So \"?ntil\". \"Until\" is 5 letters, which matches. So the first letter is missing. \"Until\" is u n t i l. So 🤥=u. But let's see if there's any other possible 5-letter word. \"Bntil\" no. \"Gntil\" no. \"Until\" is the only common one. So maybe 🤥=u is correct.\n\nNow, the fifth word. If 🐼 is not c, what else? Let's think. \"For\" + [letter] + \"es\". 6 letters. \"Forces\" (c), \"forges\" (g), \"forkes\" (k, but not a word), \"formes\" (m, \"formes\" is a term in printing, but maybe not common). \"Forges\" is a possible word. Let's check if \"forges\" makes sense in the sentence. \"Passenger trains operated to forges until 1983.\" That might not make sense. \"Forces\" is more likely. So why was 🐼=c wrong? Maybe I made a mistake in the previous attempts.\n\nLet me check attempt 4's guess. Attempt 4's guess was 🐼=d. Feedback for attempt 4: {'🐼': False}. Attempt 5: 🐼=c (False). Attempt 6: 🐼=c (False). So 🐼=c is incorrect. Let's think of other possibilities.\n\nLooking at the third word: 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 → o p e r a t e d (operated). Correct. \n\nFourth word: 🐵👽 → t o → to. Correct.\n\nThe fifth word: 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 → f o r [🐼] e s. Let's count letters. That's 6 letters. So \"for\" + [1 letter] + \"es\" → 6 letters. The structure is f-o-r-X-e-s. What X could fit?\n\nAnother possibility: \"forest\" → but that's 6 letters, but \"forest\" is f-o-r-e-s-t. No, that's not. \"Forces\" is 6 letters (f-o-r-c-e-s). \"Forges\" (f-o-r-g-e-s). \"Forkes\" (not a word). \"Fores\" is 5 letters. So maybe \"forges\". Let's assume 🐼=g. Then the fifth word is \"forges\". But does that make sense? \"Passenger trains operated to forges until 1983.\" Maybe \"forges\" as in blacksmiths, but that's less likely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fifth word is \"forces\" and 🐼=c was guessed in attempt 5, but the feedback said 🐼=False. Let's check attempt 5's feedback again. Attempt 5's guess was: 🐼=c. The feedback for 🐼 is False, so that's not correct. So maybe my substitution of the third word is wrong. Let's check the third word again.\n\nThird word: 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐. 👽=o, 🐹=p, 🥵=e, 🥶=r, 😇=a, 🐵=t, 🥵=e, 🧐=d. So o-p-e-r-a-t-e-d → \"operated\". That's correct. So that's right.\n\nThe sixth word: 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 → [🤥]-n-t-i-l. \"Until\" is u-n-t-i-l. So if 🤥=u, then that's correct. Let's check previous attempts. In attempt 1, 🤥 was guessed as g (feedback False). Attempt 2: g (False). Attempt 3: h (False). Attempt 4: k (False). Attempt 5: m (False). Attempt 6: b (False). So u hasn't been guessed yet. So 🤥=u is a possibility.\n\nWhat about 🐼? Let's think of other 6-letter words. \"Forjes\"? No. \"Forles\"? No. \"Fornes\"? Maybe a name. \"Forces\" is the most likely, but since 🐼=c was guessed and feedback was False, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let's check the fifth word again. The fifth word has 6 emojis, so 6 letters. Let's list the known letters: f (🦆), o (👽), r (🥶), e (🥵), s (🐔). So the letters are f, o, r, e, s, and one unknown (🐼). So the word is f o r [🐼] e s. The position of 🐼 is the 4th letter. So the word structure is f-o-r-X-e-s. So X is the 4th letter. Let's think of 6-letter words with that structure. \n\nPossible words:\n- forces: X=c (4th letter is c)\n- forges: X=g (4th letter is g)\n- forfes: no\n- formes: X=m (4th letter is m)\n- fornes: X=n (4th letter is n)\n- forpes: no\n- forges: X=g\n\nIf \"forces\" is correct, then X=c. But in attempt 5, the guess was 🐼=c and feedback was False, which would mean that's incorrect. So maybe it's \"forges\", X=g. Let's check if \"forges\" makes sense. \"Passenger trains operated to forges until 1983.\" Forges are places where metal is heated, but maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the fifth word is \"forces\" and I'm missing something. Let's check the entire sentence again.\n\nThe full sentence with substitutions:\n\npassenger trains operated to [f o r X e s] until 1983.\n\nIf X is c, then \"forces\". \"Passenger trains operated to forces until 1983.\" That could make sense, perhaps referring to military forces. If the feedback in attempt 5 says 🐼=c is False, then maybe there's a mistake in my assumption of 🐵=t. Let's check 🐵.\n\nAttempt 5's guess: 🐵=t. Feedback says 🐵=True. So that's correct. So 🐵=t is correct. So \"trains\" (t r a i n s) is correct. \n\nThe sixth word: \"until\" (u n t i l) makes sense. So 🤥=u.\n\nWhat about 🐼? Let's think of another possibility. Let's look at the first word again: \"passenger\" (p a s s e n g e r). That's 9 letters. The first part has 9 emojis, which matches. Correct.\n\nSecond word: \"trains\" (t r a i n s) 6 letters. Correct.\n\nThird word: \"operated\" (o p e r a t e d) 8 letters. Correct.\n\nFourth word: \"to\" (t o) 2 letters. Correct.\n\nFifth word: 6 letters. So 6 emojis. Correct.\n\nSixth word: \"until\" (u n t i l) 5 letters. Correct.\n\nSo the only missing emojis are 🐼 and 🤥. Let's check if there's any other clues. The fifth word is \"f o r [🐼] e s\". Let's think of another 6-letter word. Maybe \"forges\" (g). Let's say 🐼=g. Then the fifth word is \"forges\". \"Passenger trains operated to forges until 1983.\" Maybe \"forges\" as in a place, but not sure. Alternatively, \"formes\" (m) which is a printing term. Unlikely. \"Forkes\" (k) not a word. \"Fornes\" (n) could be a name.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fifth word is \"forces\" and the previous guess for 🐼=c was incorrect. Let's check attempt 5 again. Attempt 5's guess was 🐼=c, and feedback said 🐼=False. So that's correct, so 🐼 is not c. Then what?\n\nLet's check the sixth word. If 🤥=u, then that's correct. Let's confirm that. The sixth word is \"until\", which is a common word. So that's likely.\n\nSo, the remaining emojis are:\n\n- 🐼: need to find the letter that makes the fifth word valid.\n- 🤥: u (since \"until\" is the only 5-letter word that fits)\n\nLet's try to find another possibility for 🐼. Let's see, the fifth word: f o r [X] e s. Let's think of X as 'v'. \"Forves\" no. 'b' → \"forbes\" (Forbes, a magazine). That's possible. \"Forbes\" is a proper noun. \"Passenger trains operated to Forbes until 1983.\" That could make sense if Forbes is a place. So if X=b, then 🐼=b. Let's check if \"forbes\" fits. f o r b e s → \"Forbes\". That's a possibility.\n\nAlternatively, \"forges\" (g) or \"forces\" (c) but c was guessed. Let's see attempt 6's guess for 🐼. Attempt 6's guess was 🐼=c, feedback False. So 🐼=c is wrong.\n\nAnother possibility: \"forjes\" (j) no. \"forkes\" (k) no. \"forles\" (l) no. \"formes\" (m) no. \"fornes\" (n) maybe. \"forpes\" (p) no. \"forques\" (q) no. \"forres\" (r) → \"forres\" is a place in Scotland. \"Forres\" is a town. So \"forres\" would be f o r r e s. But 🥶=r, so the fourth emoji is 🐼, which would need to be r. But 🥶=r, and emojis are unique, so 🐼 can't be r. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, \"forges\" (g). Let's assume 🐼=g. Then the fifth word is \"forges\". Let's check if \"forges\" makes sense. \"Passenger trains operated to forges until 1983.\" Maybe forges as in factories. It's possible.\n\nSo, the remaining emojis are:\n\n- 🐼=g (if fifth word is \"forges\")\n- 🤥=u (sixth word is \"until\")\n\nLet's check if these fit with the previous feedback. \n\nIn attempt 5, 🤥 was guessed as m (feedback False). Attempt 6 guessed 🤥=b (feedback False). So u hasn't been guessed yet, so that's possible.\n\nIn attempt 5, 🐼 was guessed as c (False). Attempt 6 guessed 🐼=c (False). So if we guess 🐼=g, that's new.\n\nSo the final answer would include all known correct emojis plus the new guesses for 🐼 and 🤥.\n\nTo solve the Crypto Word Game, we analyze the encoded sentence, hints, and feedback from previous attempts to determine the correct emoji-letter mappings. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Known Correct Mappings (from Feedback):\n- 🐹=p (Attempt 4, True)\n- 😇=a (Attempt 4, True)\n- 🐔=s (Attempt 3, 4, True)\n- 🥵=e (Hint, all attempts, True)\n- 🥺=n (Attempt 3, 4, True)\n- 😴=g (Attempt 4, True)\n- 🥶=r (Attempt 4, True)\n- 🐵=t (Attempt 5, True)\n- 👽=o (Attempt 5, True)\n- 🦆=f (Attempt 3, 4, 5, True)\n- 🤑=i (Attempt 5, True)\n- 🧐=d (Attempt 5, True)\n- 🤠=l (Attempt 6, True)\n\n### Remaining Emojis to Solve: 🐼, 🤥\nWe substitute the known mappings into the encoded sentence to infer the remaining letters:\n\n#### Encoded Sentence with Known Mappings:\n`🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶` → `p a s s e n g e r` → \"passenger\" (correct).  \n`🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔` → `t r a i n s` → \"trains\" (correct).  \n`👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐` → `o p e r a t e d` → \"operated\" (correct).  \n`🐵👽` → `t o` → \"to\" (correct).  \n`🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔` → `f o r [🐼] e s` (6-letter word).  \n`🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠` → `[🤥] n t i l` (5-letter word).  \n\n### Analysis of Remaining Words:\n- **Fifth Word (`f o r [🐼] e s`)**: The structure suggests a 6-letter word starting with \"for\" and ending with \"es\". Common options include \"forces\" (c), \"forges\" (g), or \"forbes\" (b). Since previous attempts ruled out 🐼=c (feedback: False), \"forges\" (g) is a plausible alternative.  \n- **Sixth Word (`[🤥] n t i l`)**: The only common 5-letter word fitting this structure is \"until\" (u). Thus, 🤥=u.\n\n### Final Mappings:\nAll known correct mappings are included, along with the inferred mappings for 🐼 and 🤥.\n\nAnswer: 🐹=p,😇=a,🐔=s,🥵=e,🥺=n,😴=g,🥶=r,🐵=t,👽=o,🦆=f,🐼=g,🤥=u,🤑=i,🤠=l,🧐=d","Okay, let's try to figure out the remaining emojis. First, let's list out what we already know from the history. Let's check each attempt and the feedback.\n\nFrom attempt 4, the feedback says a bunch of emojis are True. Let's track each emoji:\n\nAttempt 4:\n- 🐹=p (True)\n- 😇=a (True)\n- 🐔=s (True)\n- 🥵=e (True, as per hint)\n- 🥺=n (True)\n- 😴=g (True)\n- 🥶=r (True)\n- 🐵=b (False)\n- 👽=y (False)\n- 🦆=f (True)\n- 🐼=d (False)\n- 🤥=k (False)\n- 🤑=o (False)\n- 🤠=w (False)\n- 🧐=t (False)\n\nAttempt 5:\n- 🐹=p (True)\n- 😇=a (True)\n- 🐔=s (True)\n- 🥵=e (True)\n- 🥺=n (True)\n- 😴=g (True)\n- 🥶=r (True)\n- 🐵=t (True)\n- 👽=o (True)\n- 🦆=f (True)\n- 🐼=c (False)\n- 🤥=m (False)\n- 🤑=i (True)\n- 🤠=y (False)\n- 🧐=d (True)\n\nSo after attempt 5, we have:\n🐵=t, 👽=o, 🤑=i, 🧐=d are True.\n\nAttempt 6:\n- 🐼=c (False)\n- 🤥=b (False)\n- 🤠=l (True)\n\nSo attempt 6 feedback says 🤠=l is True.\n\nAttempt 7:\n- 🐼=g (False)\n- 🤥=u (True)\n\nSo attempt 7 feedback says 🤥=u is True.\n\nNow let's list all the emojis and their current known mappings:\n\n- 🐹=p (True)\n- 😇=a (True)\n- 🐔=s (True)\n- 🥵=e (True)\n- 🥺=n (True)\n- 😴=g (True)\n- 🥶=r (True)\n- 🐵=t (True)\n- 👽=o (True)\n- 🦆=f (True)\n- 🤥=u (True)\n- 🤑=i (True)\n- 🤠=l (True)\n- 🧐=d (True)\n- 🐼=? (Still False in all attempts so far)\n\nLet's check the encoded sentence to see if we can find 🐼. Let's decode the sentence with the known mappings.\n\nEncoded Sentence: 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 🐵👽 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 1983.\n\nLet's replace each emoji with the known letters:\n\nFirst part: 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 = p a s s e n g e r\nSecond part: 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 = t r a i n s\nThird part: 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 = o p e r a t e d\nFourth part: 🐵👽 = t o\nFifth part: 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 = f o r ? e s\nSixth part: 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 = u n t i l 1983.\n\nPutting it all together: \"passenger trains operated to for?es until 1983.\"\n\nWait, the fifth part is \"f o r ? e s\". So \"for [something]es\". Let's think. \"For\" followed by a word ending with \"es\" and starts with the unknown emoji 🐼. The word structure here is 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 = f o r [🐼] e s. So the word is \"for\" + [🐼] + \"es\". Let's see possible words. Maybe \"forces\"? \"f o r c e s\". Oh! Because \"forces\" would be f o r c e s. So if 🐼=c, then that part would be \"forces\".\n\nLet's check the previous attempts. In attempt 5, they guessed 🐼=c, but feedback was False. Wait, attempt 5's feedback for 🐼 was False. Then attempt 6 guessed 🐼=c again (since attempt 6's guess for 🐼 was c, and feedback was False). Attempt 7 guessed 🐼=g, which was also False.\n\nWait, but let's check the sentence again. Let's recheck:\n\nEncoded Sentence parts:\n\n1. 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 → p a s s e n g e r → \"passenger\" (correct)\n2. 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 → t r a i n s → \"trains\" (correct)\n3. 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 → o p e r a t e d → \"operated\" (correct)\n4. 🐵👽 → t o → \"to\" (correct)\n5. 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 → f o r [🐼] e s → \"for [x]es\"\n6. 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 → u n t i l → \"until\" (correct)\n\nSo \"passenger trains operated to for [x]es until 1983.\" What makes sense here? Maybe \"for services\"? But \"services\" would be s e r v i c e s. No. Or \"for routes\"? \"routes\" is r o u t e s. No. \"Forces\" as I thought earlier: \"forces\" is f o r c e s. That fits. So \"for forces until 1983\"? Maybe. But why was 🐼=c guessed in attempt 5 (feedback: False) and attempt 6 (feedback: False). Let's check attempt 5's feedback:\n\nAttempt 5 Guess: 🐼=c → Feedback: False. So that's not c. Attempt 6's guess: 🐼=c again? Let me check attempt 6's guess:\n\nAttempt 6 Guess: 🐹=p,😇=a,🐔=s,🥵=e,🥺=n,😴=g,🥶=r,🐵=t,👽=o,🦆=f,🐼=c,🤥=b,🤑=i,🤠=l,🧐=d → Feedback: 🐼=c is False. So that's not c. Then attempt 7: 🐼=g → Feedback: False.\n\nWhat's another possibility? Let's think of \"for [x]es\". Maybe \"for lines\"? \"lines\" is l i n e s. No, the structure is f o r [x] e s. So the word is 5 letters: positions 1=f, 2=o, 3=r, 4=[x], 5=e, 6=s. So 6 letters: f o r [x] e s. So 6-letter word. \"For [x]es\".\n\nAnother possibility: \"for cores\"? \"cores\" is c o r e s. No. \"For dunes\"? \"dunes\" d u n e s. No. \"For lodes\"? l o d e s. No. \"For nodes\"? n o d e s. No. \"For moles\"? m o l e s. No. \"For foes\"? No, that's 4 letters. \"For bodes\"? b o d e s. No. \"For codes\"? c o d e s. So \"for codes\" would be f o r c o d e s. Wait, that's 7 letters. No, the structure here is 6 letters (f o r [x] e s). So 6 letters. Let's count: 🦆=f, 👽=o, 🥶=r, 🐼=?, 🥵=e, 🐔=s. So 6 emojis: f o r [x] e s. So 6 letters. So \"forces\" is 6 letters (f o r c e s). That's 6 letters, yes. So x is c. But why was attempt 5's guess of 🐼=c incorrect? Maybe the feedback was different. Let's check attempt 5's feedback again. Attempt 5's feedback for 🐼 is False, which means that 🐼=c is not correct.\n\nHmm. Let's check the other parts again. Let's confirm all the known mappings:\n\n- 🐹=p → passenger (p) correct.\n- 😇=a → passenger (a) correct.\n- 🐔=s → passenger (s s) correct.\n- 🥵=e → passenger (e) correct.\n- 🥺=n → passenger (n) correct.\n- 😴=g → passenger (g) correct. So \"passenger\" (p a s s e n g e r) which is 9 letters. Let's count: p(1), a(2), s(3), s(4), e(5), n(6), g(7), e(8), r(9). Yes, 9 letters. Correct.\n\nSecond part: 🐵=t, 🥶=r, 😇=a, 🤑=i, 🥺=n, 🐔=s → t r a i n s → \"trains\" (6 letters). Correct.\n\nThird part: 👽=o, 🐹=p, 🥵=e, 🥶=r, 😇=a, 🐵=t, 🥵=e, 🧐=d → o p e r a t e d → \"operated\" (8 letters). Correct.\n\nFourth part: 🐵=t, 👽=o → \"to\" (2 letters). Correct.\n\nFifth part: 🦆=f, 👽=o, 🥶=r, 🐼=?, 🥵=e, 🐔=s → f o r ? e s → 6 letters.\n\nSixth part: 🤥=u, 🥺=n, 🐵=t, 🤑=i, 🤠=l → u n t i l → \"until\" (5 letters). Correct.\n\nSo the full decoded sentence so far is: \"passenger trains operated to for ?es until 1983.\"\n\nWhat's a 6-letter word that fits \"for ?es\"? Let's think of possible words. Maybe \"for bends\"? No. \"For sends\"? No. \"For mends\"? No. \"For fends\"? No. \"For tends\"? t e n d s. No, \"tends\" is t e n d s. But here it's \"?es\". Oh, \"?es\" is the last two letters. So the 4th character is ?, then e, s. So \"for [?]es\".\n\nAnother angle: maybe the word is \"forest\"? No, \"forest\" is f o r e s t. No. \"Forges\"? f o r g e s. Oh! \"forges\" would be f o r g e s. So if 🐼=g, then \"forges\". Let's check. Attempt 7 guessed 🐼=g, but feedback was False. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, \"forves\"? Not a word. \"Forpes\"? No. \"Forhes\"? No. \"Forles\"? No. \"Forpes\"? No. \"Forces\" (f o r c e s) is a valid word. Let's check attempt 5: they guessed 🐼=c, feedback was False. So why is that? Maybe the fifth part is not \"forces\".\n\nWait, perhaps the sentence is \"passenger trains operated to form es until 1983.\" No, that doesn't make sense. \"form\" would be f o r m, but the structure here is f o r ? e s. So \"form\" would be 4 letters. The fifth part is 6 letters. Maybe \"for some s...\" No. Alternatively, \"for these\"? No, \"these\" is t h e s e. No. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the previous mappings. Let's check attempt 5's feedback again. Attempt 5's feedback: 🐵=t (True), 👽=o (True), 🤑=i (True), 🧐=d (True). So that's correct. Attempt 6's feedback: 🤠=l (True). Attempt 7's feedback: 🤥=u (True). So those are all correct.\n\nLet's list all the emojis and their confirmed mappings:\n\nEmoji | Letter\n--- | ---\n🐹 | p\n😇 | a\n🐔 | s\n🥵 | e\n🥺 | n\n😴 | g\n🥶 | r\n🐵 | t\n👽 | o\n🦆 | f\n🤥 | u\n🤑 | i\n🤠 | l\n🧐 | d\n🐼 | ?\n\nNow, let's check if there's any other occurrence of 🐼 in the encoded sentence. The encoded sentence has 🐼 only once in the fifth part: 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔. So that's the only occurrence.\n\nWhat's another possible 6-letter word starting with \"for\" and ending with \"es\"? Let's think of \"forjes\" (not a word), \"forkes\" (no), \"forles\" (no), \"fornes\" (no), \"forpes\" (no), \"forques\" (no), \"forwes\" (no). Alternatively, \"forges\" (f o r g e s) is a word, but attempt 7 guessed 🐼=g, feedback was False. \"Forces\" (f o r c e s) is a word, but attempt 5's guess of 🐼=c was False.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let's check the fifth part again. The fifth part is 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔. Let's list the emojis in order: 🦆, 👽, 🥶, 🐼, 🥵, 🐔. We know:\n\n🦆=f, 👽=o, 🥶=r, 🥵=e, 🐔=s. So the letters are f, o, r, [🐼], e, s. So the word is \"for\" + [🐼] + \"es\". So 6 letters: f o r [x] e s.\n\nPossible 6-letter words: \"forces\" (x=c), \"forges\" (x=g), \"forkes\" (no), \"fornes\" (no), \"formes\" (no, \"formes\" is a plural of \"forme\", a printing term), \"forpes\" (no), \"forques\" (no), \"forwes\" (no). \n\n\"Formes\" would be f o r m e s. So x=m. Let's check if that's possible. If 🐼=m, then the word would be \"formes\". But does \"passenger trains operated to for formes until 1983\" make sense? Maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, \"foretes\"? No. \"Forales\"? No. \n\nAnother possibility: \"for sees\"? No, that's two words. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sentence is \"passenger trains operated to fores until 1983.\" But \"fores\" is a word (plural of \"fore\", front part). So \"fores\" would be f o r e s. But then the structure would be 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 = f o r e s. But that's 5 letters (f, o, r, e, s), but the emoji sequence is 6 emojis. Oh, wait, the emoji sequence is 6: 🦆,👽,🥶,🐼,🥵,🐔. So 6 letters. So \"fores\" is 5 letters, so that's not it.\n\nHmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the previous mappings. Let's check if 🥶=r is correct. Let's check the first part: 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 → p a s s e n g e r. The last emoji is 🥶, which in the guess was r, and that's correct because \"passenger\" ends with r. So 🥶=r is correct. \n\nThe second part: 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 → t r a i n s. \"trains\" has r as the second letter (t r a i n s). So that's correct. So 🥶=r is correct.\n\nThird part: 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 → o p e r a t e d. \"operated\" has r as the fourth letter (o p e r a t e d). Correct. So 🥶=r is correct.\n\nSo that's correct. \n\nLet's think of the fifth part again. \"for [x]es\". What if x is 'v'? \"forves\" isn't a word. 'b'? \"forbes\" (Forbes, a magazine). Oh! \"Forbes\" would be f o r b e s. That's a proper noun. So \"passenger trains operated to Forbes until 1983.\" That could make sense. So if 🐼=b, then the word would be \"Forbes\". Let's check if that's possible. \n\nIn attempt 6, they guessed 🤥=b, feedback was False. So 🤥 is now u (from attempt 7's feedback, which was True). So 🐼=b hasn't been guessed yet (as far as I can tell). Let's check previous attempts for 🐼:\n\nAttempt 1: 🐼=l → Feedback: False.\nAttempt 2: 🐼=p → Feedback: False.\nAttempt 3: 🐼=c → Feedback: False.\nAttempt 4: 🐼=d → Feedback: False.\nAttempt 5: 🐼=c → Feedback: False.\nAttempt 6: 🐼=c → Feedback: False.\nAttempt 7: 🐼=g → Feedback: False.\n\nSo 🐼=b hasn't been guessed yet. Let's test this. If 🐼=b, then the fifth part becomes \"Forbes\". That's a possible name. So \"passenger trains operated to Forbes until 1983.\" That makes sense. So maybe 🐼=b.\n\nAlternatively, \"forbes\" would fit. Let's check if there's any other possible word. \"Forbes\" is a plausible proper noun here. So let's assume 🐼=b.\n\nBut wait, what other letters are left? Let's list all the letters used so far. The letters we have are: p, a, s, e, n, g, r, t, o, f, u, i, l, d. The remaining letters in the alphabet (assuming all are unique) would be: b, c, h, j, k, m, q, v, w, x, y, z.\n\nSince the feedback for each guess only marks True\/False for each emoji, and all previous guesses for 🐼 have been other letters, maybe 🐼=b is the correct one. Let's check if \"Forbes\" makes sense in the sentence. \"Passenger trains operated to Forbes until 1983.\" That sounds plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"forges\" (if 🐼=g), but attempt 7 guessed that and it was False. So that's out. \"Forces\" (c) was guessed in attempt 5, feedback False. \"Formes\" (m) is possible but less likely. \"Forbes\" (b) is a good candidate.\n\nSo I think the remaining emoji is 🐼=b.\n\nTo solve the Crypto Word Game, we analyze the encoded sentence, hints, and historical guesses\/feedback to determine the correct mappings for each emoji. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Known Mappings (from Historical Feedback):\n- **🐹=p** (True in attempts 4-7)\n- **😇=a** (True in attempts 4-7)\n- **🐔=s** (True in attempts 3-7)\n- **🥵=e** (Given hint, True in all attempts)\n- **🥺=n** (True in attempts 3-7)\n- **😴=g** (True in attempts 4-7)\n- **🥶=r** (True in attempts 4-7)\n- **🐵=t** (True in attempts 5-7)\n- **👽=o** (True in attempts 5-7)\n- **🦆=f** (True in attempts 3-7)\n- **🤥=u** (True in attempt 7)\n- **🤑=i** (True in attempts 5-7)\n- **🤠=l** (True in attempt 6)\n- **🧐=d** (True in attempts 5-7)\n\n### Remaining Emoji: **🐼**\nThe encoded sentence includes the segment: `🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔`. Substituting known mappings:  \n`🦆=f`, `👽=o`, `🥶=r`, `🥵=e`, `🐔=s` → `f o r [🐼] e s`.  \n\nThis forms a 6-letter word: \"for[🐼]es\". The most plausible word here is \"Forbes\" (a proper noun), which fits the structure and context of the sentence (\"passenger trains operated to Forbes until 1983\").

The encoded sentence is: \"😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission.\" We know that 😍=t because of the hint. \n\nFirst, let's replace all 😍 with t. Let's rewrite the sentence with that substitution:\n\n\"ta🐼🐼 🐸e😈eatet🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) ta🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 to sub🐦it 🐶ith the ta🐼🐼🐦ission.\"\n\nNow, let's look for common words. The word \"the\" is a common one, and in the sentence, there's \"😍he\" which we replaced to \"the\". That checks out, so that's correct.\n\nNext, \"ta🐼🐼\" appears multiple times. Let's see. The first part is \"ta🐼🐼\". Let's think of two-letter words that follow \"ta\". Maybe \"ta\" followed by two letters. Let's look at other instances. Later, there's \"ta🐼🐼🐦ission\" which, if we split, might be \"ta🐼🐼\" + \"🐦ission\". \"Fission\" is a word, but here it's \"🐦ission\". So maybe \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"task\"? Let's test that. If \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"task\", then 🐼 would be \"s\" and \"k\"? Wait, no, because each emoji is a unique letter. So \"ta🐼🐼\" is t-a-🐼-🐼. So the structure is t a [emoji] [emoji]. So the word is 4 letters: t, a, x, y. Let's look for other parts. The sentence also has \"😍o\" which is \"to\", that's correct. \n\nAnother part: \"sub🐦it\". Since \"sub\" is a prefix, \"subXit\" could be \"submit\". So \"sub🐦it\" would be \"submit\" if 🐦=m. Because \"sub\" + m + \"it\" = \"submit\". Let's check that. So 🐦=m. Then \"sub🐦it\" becomes \"submit\". That makes sense.\n\nThen, \"ta🐼🐼🐦ission\" would be \"ta🐼🐼m\" + \"ission\". So \"ta🐼🐼mission\". If that's \"taskmission\"? No, maybe \"task\" + \"mission\"? \"taskmission\" isn't a word, but \"task\" + \"mission\" would be \"task mission\". Alternatively, \"ta🐼🐼\" could be \"term\"? No, \"term\" is t-e-r-m. But here it's t-a-🐼-🐼. Let's see another part: \"🐸e😈eatet🐸\". Let's parse that. The structure is [🐸]e[😈]eatet[🐸]. Let's see. The word starts with 🐸, then e, then 😈, then e, a, t, e, t, then 🐸. So the word is [X]e[Y]eatet[X]. Let's count the letters: X e Y e a t e t X. That's 9 letters. Let's think of 9-letter words. Maybe \"networked\"? No. Let's look at \"eatet\" in the middle. \"eate\" could be part of \"create\", but \"t\" after. Maybe \"retreater\"? No. Alternatively, maybe \"steepest\"? No. Let's think of the part \"a🐷 sno🐶\". \"a\" followed by 🐷, then \"sno\" + 🐶. \"sno\" + 🐶 could be \"snob\", \"snow\", \"snot\", \"snoo\", etc. Let's say \"sno🐶\" is \"snow\" (so 🐶=w). Then \"a🐷\" would be \"a\" + 🐷. If \"a🐷\" is \"and\", then 🐷=n. Let's test that. So \"a🐷 sno🐶\" becomes \"and snow\". That's possible.\n\nLooking at the part \"(5: 20)\". Maybe that's a time, like 5:20, but not sure. Let's check \"😈orce🐸\". \"😈orce🐸\" is [Y]orce[X]. \"Force\" is a common word. So if \"😈orce🐸\" is \"forceX\"? No, but maybe \"YorceX\" is \"sourceX\"? Let's see. If \"YorceX\" is \"source\", then Y=s and X=e. Let's check. \"source\" is s-o-u-r-c-e. So if 😈=s, then \"😈orce🐸\" is s-o-r-c-e-🐸. If 🐸=e, then \"source\" would be s-o-r-c-e-e? No, that's \"sourcee\". Alternatively, \"force\" plus something. \"Force\" is f-o-r-c-e. So if \"😈orce🐸\" is \"forceX\", then 😈=f, and 🐸 is the next letter. Let's think: \"ta🐼🐼\" appears again in \"ta🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶\". If \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"task\", then \"task [Y]orce[X] snow\". If \"YorceX\" is \"force\", then \"task force snow\" could make sense. So \"force\" would be 😈=f, o, r, c, e, and 🐸=e? But \"😈orce🐸\" would be f-o-r-c-e-e? No. Alternatively, \"task force\" would be \"ta🐼🐼 😈orce\". If \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"task\" (so 🐼=s and 🐼=k? Wait, no, each emoji is a unique letter. So \"ta🐼🐼\" is t-a-🐼-🐼, so two emojis, each representing a letter. So \"task\" is t-a-s-k, so 🐼 would be s and 🐼=k? But 🐼 is the same emoji, so that's impossible. Each emoji is a unique letter. So \"ta🐼🐼\" is t a [same emoji] [same emoji]. So the third and fourth letters are the same. So \"ta\" followed by two of the same letter. Like \"tall\" (t-a-l-l). That's possible. Let's try that. So \"ta🐼🐼\" would be \"tall\" (so 🐼=l). Let's check. Then \"ta🐼🐼\" becomes \"tall\". Then \"ta🐼🐼🐦ission\" would be \"tall🐦ission\". If \"fission\" is a word, maybe \"tallmision\"? No. Alternatively, \"tall\" + \"mission\" would be \"tallmission\", but \"mission\" is m-i-s-s-i-o-n. Hmm.\n\nLet's go back to \"sub🐦it\". If \"sub🐦it\" is \"submit\", then 🐦=m. That makes sense because \"submit\" is s-u-b-m-i-t. So \"sub\" + m + \"it\" = \"submit\". So 🐦=m. Then \"sub🐦it\" becomes \"submit\". That works.\n\nAnother part: \"🐶i😍h\" becomes \"🐶ith\". Since 😍=t, \"🐶ith\" is a word. \"With\" is a common word. So if \"🐶ith\" is \"with\", then 🐶=w. So \"🐶=w\". That's a good guess. Let's confirm: \"🐶i😍h\" = w-i-t-h = \"with\". Perfect. So 🐶=w.\n\nThen \"sno🐶\" becomes \"sno\" + w = \"snow\". That's a word. So \"sno🐶\" is \"snow\". That fits. So that's correct. Then \"a🐷 sno🐶\" is \"a🐷 snow\". What's a word that starts with \"a\" and is followed by \"snow\"? Maybe \"and snow\" (a-n-d). So \"a🐷\" would be \"and\", so 🐷=n. Let's check: \"a🐷\" = a + n = \"an\"? No, \"an snow\" doesn't make sense. \"a\" + \"n\" is \"an\", but \"an snow\" is incorrect. Maybe \"a\" + \"t\" is \"at\"? \"at snow\" isn't right. \"a\" + \"s\" is \"as snow\"? No. Alternatively, \"a\" + \"l\" is \"all snow\"? No. Let's think of \"a🐷\" as \"a\" + 🐷, and the next word is \"snow\". Maybe \"ahead snow\"? No. Alternatively, \"a\" + \"🐷\" could be \"a\" + \"part\" but that's longer. Maybe \"a🐷\" is \"a\" + \"nd\" (but 🐷 is one emoji, so one letter). So \"a\" + \"n\" = \"an\", but \"an snow\" is not right. Maybe \"a🐷\" is \"a\" + \"t\" = \"at\", \"at snow\" isn't right. Maybe \"a🐷\" is \"a\" + \"b\" = \"ab\", which doesn't make sense. Let's set that aside for now.\n\nLooking at \"🐸e😈eatet🐸\". Let's substitute 😍=t and 🐶=w. So the word is 🐸-e-😈-e-a-t-e-t-🐸. Let's count letters: that's 9 letters. Let's think of 9-letter words. Let's see the middle part: \"eate t\". Maybe \"e a t e t\" is \"e a t e t\" which could be part of \"reatt\". Let's think of the structure: X e Y e a t e t X. Let's try X = r. Then \"r e Y e a t e t r\". \"reY e a t e t r\". Maybe \"recreate r\"? No. Alternatively, X = s. \"s e Y e a t e t s\". \"seY e a t e t s\". Maybe \"seventies\"? No, that's s-e-v-e-n-t-i-e-s. Not matching. Alternatively, \"steepest\" is s-t-e-e-p-e-s-t. No. Let's look at \"😍e\" in \"🐸e😈ea😍e🐸\". The part \"ea😍e\" is \"ea t e\". So \"ea t e\" could be \"e a t e\". So \"🐸e😈e a t e t 🐸\". Let's think of \"steepest\" again. No. Maybe \"streetet\"? No. Let's think of \"retreater\" (r-e-t-r-e-a-t-e-r). That's 9 letters. Let's check: r-e-t-r-e-a-t-e-r. So X=r, Y=t. So \"r e t e a t e t r\". That would fit: 🐸=r, 😈=t. But 😍 is already t, and emojis must be unique. So 😈 can't be t. So that's not possible. \n\nAnother angle: \"😍o\" is \"to\", which is correct. \"sub🐦it\" is \"submit\" (so 🐦=m). \"🐶i😍h\" is \"with\" (so 🐶=w). \"sno🐶\" is \"snow\" (so 🐶=w, which we already have). \n\nThe sentence has \"😍he\" which is \"the\" (correct). \"ta🐼🐼\" is a word. Let's look at \"ta🐼🐼 🐸e😈eatet🐸 a🐷 sno🐶\". If \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"task\", then \"task [something] a🐷 snow\". Let's try \"task force snow\". If \"😈orce🐸\" is \"force\", then \"😈=f\", \"🐸=e\". Let's check \"😈orce🐸\" = f-o-r-c-e. So \"force\" is f-o-r-c-e. So if 🐸=e, then \"😈orce🐸\" is f-o-r-c-e. That would make \"force\". So \"😈=f\", \"🐸=e\". Let's test that. \n\nIf 🐸=e, then \"🐸e😈eatet🐸\" becomes e-e-f-e-a-t-e-t-e. That's \"eefeatet e\". That doesn't make sense. Hmm. Maybe \"🐸=s\". Let's try \"🐸=s\". Then \"🐸e😈eatet🐸\" is s-e-😈-e-a-t-e-t-s. Let's see: \"seY e a t e t s\". Maybe \"seventies\"? s-e-v-e-n-t-i-e-s. No, the letters here are s-e-Y-e-a-t-e-t-s. Let's count: 1(s),2(e),3(Y),4(e),5(a),6(t),7(e),8(t),9(s). So letters 1-9: s e Y e a t e t s. Let's see if that forms a word. Maybe \"secrete s\"? No. \"seventets\"? No. Maybe \"secretes\"? s-e-c-r-e-t-e-s. That's 8 letters. No. \n\nLet's look at \"ta🐼🐼🐦ission\" which we think 🐦=m. So \"ta🐼🐼m\" + \"ission\". \"mission\" is m-i-s-s-i-o-n. So \"ta🐼🐼m\" + \"ission\" would be \"ta🐼🐼mission\". If \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"task\", then \"taskmission\" isn't a word. If \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"term\", then \"termmission\"? No. Maybe \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"team\". \"team mission\" makes sense. So \"ta🐼🐼\" = \"team\". So \"t-a-🐼-🐼\" = \"t-a-e-m\". So 🐼=e and 🐼=m? No, same emoji. Each emoji is a unique letter, so \"ta🐼🐼\" is t a [same emoji] [same emoji]. So \"team\" is t-e-a-m, which is different. So \"ta🐼🐼\" would need to have the third and fourth letters the same. Like \"tall\" (t-a-l-l), \"tart\" (t-a-r-t), \"tutu\" (t-u-t-u), \"titi\" (unlikely). Let's think \"tall\". So \"ta🐼🐼\" = \"tall\" (so 🐼=l). Then \"ta🐼🐼🐦ission\" is \"tallm\" + \"ission\" = \"tallmission\". Not a word, but maybe \"tall\" + \"mission\" as a phrase. \n\nLet's try another part: \"a🐷 sno🐶\" is \"a🐷 snow\". If \"a🐷\" is \"a\" + \"nd\" (but 🐷 is one letter), so \"a\" + \"n\" = \"an\". \"an snow\" is incorrect. \"a\" + \"t\" = \"at\". \"at snow\" could be possible, like \"at snow (5:20)\". Maybe a time reference. \n\nLet's summarize the knowns and possible guesses:\n\n- 😍=t (given)\n- 🐦=m (from \"sub🐦it\" = \"submit\")\n- 🐶=w (from \"🐶i😍h\" = \"with\")\n\nLet's check \"sub🐦i😍\" = \"sub\" + 🐦 + \"i\" + 😍. We think 🐦=m, 😍=t. So \"subm i t\" = \"submit\". Perfect, that works. So \"sub🐦i😍\" is \"submit\".\n\nThen \"🐶i😍h\" = 🐶 + \"i\" + 😍 + \"h\" = w + i + t + h = \"with\". Correct.\n\nNow, \"sno🐶\" = \"sno\" + 🐶 = \"sno\" + w = \"snow\". Correct.\n\nNext, \"😍o\" = t + o = \"to\". Correct.\n\n\"😍he\" = t + h + e = \"the\". Correct.\n\nNow, let's look at \"ta🐼🐼\". Let's call this word W. W appears in:\n\n1. W 🐸e😈eatet🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20)\n2. W 😈orce🐸 sno🐶\n3. W🐦ission (since \"ta🐼🐼🐦ission\" is W + 🐦 + \"ission\" = W + m + \"ission\")\n\nIf W is \"task\", then \"task mission\" (W + m + ission = task + mission) makes sense. So \"task mission\". That would mean W is \"task\" (t-a-s-k). So \"ta🐼🐼\" = \"task\". Therefore, 🐼 is s and k? No, same emoji. So \"ta🐼🐼\" is t-a-🐼-🐼. So two letters, both represented by 🐼. So \"task\" would require 🐼 to be s and k, but that's two different letters. So that's impossible. So W must have the third and fourth letters the same. Let's think of \"tall\" (t-a-l-l). Then \"tall mission\" could be a thing. So W = \"tall\" (so 🐼=l).\n\nThen \"ta🐼🐼\" = \"tall\".\n\nNow, \"tall 😈orce🐸 snow\". If \"😈orce🐸\" is \"force\", then \"tall force snow\" could be a phrase. So \"force\" is f-o-r-c-e. So 😈=f, and 🐸=e. Let's check \"😈orce🐸\" = f-o-r-c-e. So that's \"force\". That works. Then 🐸=e.\n\nNow, let's check \"🐸e😈eatet🐸\" with 🐸=e and 😈=f. So that's e-e-f-e-a-t-e-t-e. That's \"eefeatet e\". Doesn't make sense. Hmm. Maybe \"🐸=r\". Let's try \"😈orce🐸\" = \"source\" (s-o-u-r-c-e). Then 😈=s, 🐸=e. \"source\" is s-o-u-r-c-e. So \"😈orce🐸\" = s-o-u-r-c-e. Then \"tall source snow\" could make sense. Let's check \"🐸e😈eatet🐸\" with 🐸=e and 😈=s. Then it's e-e-s-e-a-t-e-t-e. \"ee seatete\"? No. \n\nAlternatively, \"😈orce🐸\" could be \"course\" (c-o-u-r-s-e). So 😈=c, 🐸=s. Then \"course\" is c-o-u-r-s-e. Then \"tall course snow\" could work. Then \"🐸e😈eatet🐸\" would be s-e-c-e-a-t-e-t-s. \"seceatet s\". Doesn't make sense. \n\nLet's think of \"🐸e😈eatet🐸\" as a verb. Maybe \"complete\" but that's 8 letters. Or \"recreate\" (r-e-c-r-e-a-t-e), which is 8 letters. Our word is 9 letters. \"recreate r\"? No. \n\nLet's try another approach. The sentence structure:\n\nOriginal with 😍=t: \"ta🐼🐼 🐸e😈eatet🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) ta🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 to submit with the ta🐼🐼mission.\"\n\nSo \"to submit with the [ta🐼🐼]mission.\" So \"ta🐼🐼mission\" is likely \"taskmission\" or \"teamission\" or \"tallmission\". If \"ta🐼🐼mission\" is \"taskmission\", then \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"task\", and \"mission\" is \"mission\". So \"task mission\". That makes sense. So \"ta🐼🐼\" = \"task\" (t-a-s-k). But that would require 🐼 to be s and k. But 🐼 is a single emoji, so it must represent a single letter. So that's impossible. So \"ta🐼🐼\" must be a 4-letter word where the third and fourth letters are the same. Let's think of \"tatt\" (t-a-t-t), \"titt\" (t-i-t-t), \"toot\" (t-o-o-t), \"turt\" (t-u-r-t), \"tutu\" (t-u-t-u). \"Toot\" is possible. \"ta🐼🐼\" = \"toot\" (t-o-o-t). Then \"toot mission\" doesn't make sense. \"Tatt\" (t-a-t-t) could be \"tatt mission\". Not likely. \"Tall\" (t-a-l-l) is more common. \"tall mission\" could work.\n\nAssuming 🐼=l, then \"ta🐼🐼\" = \"tall\". Then \"tallmission\" is \"tall mission\". \n\nNow, \"🐸e😈eatet🐸\" — let's see, maybe \"steepest\" but that's s-t-e-e-p-e-s-t (8 letters). Our word is 9 letters. \"Steepestt\"? No. \"Sweetest\" (s-w-e-e-t-e-s-t) — 8 letters. No. \"Seventeen\" (s-e-v-e-n-t-e-e-n) — 9 letters. Let's check: s-e-v-e-n-t-e-e-n. So the structure would be 🐸=s, e, 😈=v, e, a, t, e, e, n. But our word is 🐸-e-😈-e-a-t-e-t-🐸. So letters 1: 🐸, 2: e, 3: 😈, 4: e, 5: a, 6: t, 7: e, 8: t, 9: 🐸. So 1 and 9 are the same. 7: e, 8: t. So \"s-e-v-e-a-t-e-t-s\". \"sev eat ets\"? No. Doesn't make sense.\n\nLet's try to guess the remaining emojis based on the words we have:\n\nKnown:\n😍=t\n🐦=m (from submit)\n🐶=w (from with)\n\nPossible guesses:\n\n- 🐼: Let's say \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"task\" — but can't, so maybe \"tall\" so 🐼=l. Let's guess 🐼=l.\n- 🐸: Let's say \"🐸e😈eatet🐸\" could be \"secretet\" (but not a word). Alternatively, \"🐸\" could be \"s\" (from \"submit\" has s, but \"sub\" is s-u-b). \"sub\" is part of \"submit\", so \"sub\" is s-u-b. So \"sub🐦it\" = s-u-b-m-i-t. So \"sub\" is s-u-b, which are letters not yet assigned. So \"s\" is not assigned to any emoji yet. So maybe 🐸=s. Let's see. If \"🐸=s\", then \"🐸e😈eatet🐸\" is s-e-😈-e-a-t-e-t-s. Maybe \"secrete s\"? No. \"secretes\" is s-e-c-r-e-t-e-s (8 letters). Close. Our word is 9 letters: s-e-😈-e-a-t-e-t-s. Maybe \"secretets\"? No.\n\nAnother angle: \"a🐷\" — \"a\" + 🐷. If \"a🐷\" is \"and\", then 🐷=n. Let's guess 🐷=n. So \"a🐷\" = a-n = \"an\". But \"an snow\" isn't right. Alternatively, \"a🐷\" = \"as\", so 🐷=s. \"as snow\" could work. \"as snow (5:20)\".\n\nLet's list all emojis and possible letters:\n\nEmojis present: 😍, 🐼, 🐸, 😈, 🐷, 🐶, 🐦.\n\nKnown: 😍=t, 🐦=m, 🐶=w.\n\nNeed to find: 🐼, 🐸, 😈, 🐷.\n\nPossible guesses:\n\n- 🐦=m (submit)\n- 🐶=w (with)\n- 😍=t (given)\n- 🐼=s (if \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"task\", but no, since 🐼 is one emoji. Alternatively, \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"team\" (t-e-a-m), but that's 4 letters, t-a-🐼-🐼. No. Maybe \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"take\" (t-a-k-e), but then 🐼 would be k and e, which is impossible. So perhaps \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"tact\" (t-a-c-t). So 🐼=c. Then \"tact mission\" could work. So 🐼=c.\n\nIf 🐼=c, then \"ta🐼🐼\" = t-a-c-c = \"tacc\". Not a word. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"tart\" (t-a-r-t). So 🐼=r. Then \"tart mission\" — possible. \n\nAlternatively, \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"twin\" (t-w-i-n), but \"ta\" starts with t-a, so no.\n\nThis is tricky. Let's try to make a guess with the information we have. We know 😍=t, and we deduced 🐦=m (submit), 🐶=w (with). Let's include those in the answer. Also, the hint emoji 😍=t must be included. \n\nSo possible answer: 😍=t, 🐦=m, 🐶=w. Maybe other guesses. Let's see if we can find more.\n\nThe part \"😈orce🐸 sno🐶\" — \"😈orce🐸\" and \"sno🐶=snow\". If \"😈orce🐸\" is \"force\", then \"force snow\" could be a phrase. So \"force\" is f-o-r-c-e. So 😈=f, 🐸=e. Let's guess that. So 😈=f, 🐸=e.\n\nThen \"🐸e😈eatet🐸\" = e-e-f-e-a-t-e-t-e = \"eefeatet e\". Doesn't make sense, but maybe it's a typo or part of a longer phrase. \n\nThe part \"a🐷\" — if \"a🐷\" is \"at\", then 🐷=t. But 😍=t, so can't. \"a🐷\" = \"an\", 🐷=n. So 🐷=n.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n😍=t (given)\n🐦=m (submit)\n🐶=w (with)\n😈=f (force)\n🐸=e (force)\n🐷=n (a🐷=an)\n🐼=?\n\nThe \"ta🐼🐼\" part: t-a-🐼-🐼. Let's say \"tall\" (t-a-l-l), so 🐼=l.\n\nSo possible answer: 😍=t, 🐼=l, 🐸=e, 😈=f, 🐷=n, 🐶=w, 🐦=m.\n\nTo solve the crypto word game, we start with the given hint 😍=t and analyze the encoded sentence. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **😍=t (given)**: Replacing 😍 with \"t\" in the encoded sentence helps identify other words.  \n   - \"😍he\" becomes \"the\" (a common word), confirming 😍=t.  \n   - \"😍o\" becomes \"to\" (another common word).  \n\n2. **🐶=w**: The phrase \"🐶i😍h\" becomes \"🐶ith\". Since \"with\" is a common word, 🐶=w (🐶i😍h = w-i-t-h = \"with\").  \n\n3. **🐦=m**: The phrase \"sub🐦i😍\" becomes \"sub🐦it\" (since 😍=t). \"Submit\" is a common word, so sub + 🐦 + it = submit → 🐦=m (sub + m + it = \"submit\").  \n\n4. **sno🐶=snow**: With 🐶=w, \"sno🐶\" becomes \"sno\" + w = \"snow\".  \n\n5. **😈=f and 🐸=e**: The phrase \"😈orce🐸\" likely refers to \"force\" (a common word). Thus, 😈=f (force starts with \"f\") and 🐸=e (force ends with \"e\").  \n\n6. **🐷=n**: The phrase \"a🐷 sno🐶\" becomes \"a🐷 snow\". \"And snow\" is plausible, so a + 🐷 = \"an\" → 🐷=n.  \n\n7. **ta🐼🐼=tall**: The repeated phrase \"ta🐼🐼\" appears multiple times. \"Tall\" (t-a-l-l) is a common 4-letter word where the third and fourth letters are the same, so 🐼=l.  \n\nPutting it all together, the guessed emojis and their corresponding letters are:  \n\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐼=l,🐸=e,😈=f,🐷=n,🐶=w,🐦=m","Okay, let's try to figure out the emojis step by step. First, the encoded sentence is: \"😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission.\"\n\nWe know from the hint that 😍=t. The first attempt had some feedback: 😍=t is correct (which we already knew), 😈=f is correct, 🐶=w is correct, 🐦=m is correct. The others (🐼, 🐸, 🐷) were wrong.\n\nLet's start with the knowns. Let's replace the known emojis first.\n\n😍=t, 😈=f, 🐶=w, 🐦=m. So let's substitute:\n\nEncoded sentence becomes:\nta🐼🐼 [🐸]efeat[🐸] a[🐷] sn[w] (5:20) ta🐼🐼 force[🐸] sn[w] to submi[t] wi[th] the ta🐼🐼mission.\n\nWait, let's parse each part carefully. Let's split the sentence into parts:\n\n1. \"😍a🐼🐼\" → ta[🐼][🐼]\n2. \"🐸e😈ea😍e🐸\" → [🐸]efeat[🐸]\n3. \"a🐷\" → a[🐷]\n4. \"sno🐶\" → sno[w] → snow (since 🐶=w)\n5. \"(5: 20)\" → remains as is\n6. \"😍a🐼🐼\" → ta[🐼][🐼]\n7. \"😈orce🐸\" → force[🐸]\n8. \"sno🐶\" → snow\n9. \"😍o\" → to\n10. \"sub🐦i😍\" → submi[t] (since 🐦=m, so submi[t])\n11. \"🐶i😍h\" → wi[th] (🐶=w, 😍=t → with)\n12. \"😍he\" → the\n13. \"😍a🐼🐼🐦ission\" → ta[🐼][🐼]mission (since 🐦=m → mission)\n\nSo let's list the known parts and see what's missing.\n\nLooking at part 2: \"🐸e😈ea😍e🐸\" → [🐸]efeat[🐸]. The word here is probably \"defeat\" or \"cefeat\" or \"defeat\". Wait, \"defeat\" is a common word. Let's check: if [🐸] is 'd', then the word would be \"defeatd\"? No, because the structure is [🐸]e f e a t [🐸]. Wait, let's count letters. Let's count the characters in part 2:\n\nOriginal: 🐸 e 😈 e a 😍 e 🐸 → that's 7 characters. So [🐸] e f e a t [🐸]. So positions 1: [🐸], 2: e, 3: f, 4: e, 5: a, 6: t, 7: [🐸]. So the word is 7 letters long. What 7-letter word fits [x]efeat[x]? Maybe \"defeats\"? But that's 7 letters: d e f e a t s. Oh! Wait, \"defeats\" is d-e-f-e-a-t-s. That's 7 letters. So if the first [🐸] is 'd' and the last [🐸] is 's', then the word would be \"defeats\". Let's check: [d] e f e a t [s] → defeats. That fits. Let's test that. So 🐸 could be 's'? Wait, but the 7-letter word would be [x] e f e a t [x]. Let's see: \"defeats\" is 7 letters (d e f e a t s). So first emoji is d, last is s? But the same emoji is used at both ends. So the emoji 🐸 would be the same character in both positions. So [🐸] e f e a t [🐸] → [x]efeat[x]. Let's think of 7-letter words where the first and last letters are the same. Let's see: \"leveler\" (no, doesn't fit). \"repeter\"? No. Maybe \"retreat\"? No. \"reviver\"? No. \"relayer\"? No. \"redder\"? No. \"referer\"? No. \"reposer\"? No. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's \"defeated\", but that's 8 letters. Alternatively, maybe the word is \"defeats\" (7 letters) where the first and last letters are different. But that would require two different emojis, but here it's the same emoji. So maybe the word is \"defeat\" but with something else. Wait, part 2 is \"🐸e😈ea😍e🐸\" → let's count the number of emojis and letters:\n\nEmoji sequence: 🐸 (1), e (2), 😈 (3, which is f), e (4), a (5), 😍 (6, which is t), e (7), 🐸 (8). Wait, wait, maybe I miscounted. Let's write it as each character:\n\nThe part is: 🐸 e 😈 e a 😍 e 🐸 → that's 8 characters. Let's count: 1.🐸, 2.e, 3.😈, 4.e, 5.a, 6.😍, 7.e, 8.🐸. So 8 characters. So the word is 8 letters long. So [x] e f e a t e [x]. Let's see 8-letter words. \"defeated\" → d e f e a t e d. Oh! That's 8 letters. So [d] e f e a t e [d] → defeated. That fits. So the emoji 🐸 would be 'd' because the first and last characters are 'd'. So 🐸=d. Let's check: if 🐸=d, then part 2 becomes \"defeated\". Let's see: d e f e a t e d → defeated. Perfect! That makes sense. So 🐸=d. Let's check that.\n\nSo part 2: 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 → d e f e a t e d → defeated. That works. Let's note that.\n\nNow part 7: \"😈orce🐸\" → f o r c e [🐸]. Since 😈=f, this part is \"force\" plus the emoji 🐸. If 🐸=d, then \"forced\". So \"force\" + d → forced. That makes sense. So part 7 would be \"forced\". That fits.\n\nPart 1: \"😍a🐼🐼\" → t a [🐼][🐼]. Let's look at part 13: \"😍a🐼🐼🐦ission\" → t a [🐼][🐼] m i s s i o n. So the last part is \"mission\". So \"ta[🐼][🐼]mission\". What word starts with \"ta\" and ends with \"mission\"? \"transmission\" → t r a n s m i s s i o n. Wait, transmission is t-r-a-n-s-mission. Oh, \"transmission\" → t a [n][s] mission? Because \"ta\" + \"ns\" + \"mission\" → \"tansmission\"? No. Alternatively, \"transportation\" is too long. Let's think. Let's look at part 1: \"ta[🐼][🐼]\". Maybe it's \"task\" (ta + sk). But part 13 is \"ta[🐼][🐼]mission\". Let's see \"ta[🐼][🐼]mission\". Let's break it down: \"ta\" + [🐼][🐼] + \"mission\". So [ta] [xx] [mission]. Maybe \"taskmission\"? No. Maybe \"tacticalmission\"? No. Alternatively, \"ta\" [xx] \"mission\" could be \"transmission\" → \"trans\" mission. Oh! \"transmission\" is t-r-a-n-s-mission. So \"trans\" mission. So \"ta\" + \"ns\" → \"tans\"? No. Wait, \"transmission\" is t r a n s m i s s i o n. So \"trans\" is the prefix. So \"trans\" mission. So \"ta\" [n][s] mission → \"tansmission\"? No, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe \"ta\" [s][k] mission → \"taskmission\"? Not a word. Let's check part 1 again: \"ta[🐼][🐼]\" and part 6: \"ta[🐼][🐼]\" (since part 6 is same as part 1). Let's see the entire sentence structure. Let's list all parts with knowns:\n\n1. ta[🐼][🐼] → maybe a noun, like \"tank\", \"task\", \"team\", \"tale\", \"tail\", \"tall\", \"tarp\", etc.\n\nLooking at part 11: \"🐶i😍h\" → w i t h → \"with\" (since 🐶=w, 😍=t → with). That's correct. Part 10: \"sub🐦i😍\" → sub m i t → \"submit\" (since 🐦=m, 😍=t → submit). Correct. Part 9: \"😍o\" → t o → \"to\". Correct. Part 8: \"sno🐶\" → sno w → \"snow\". Correct. Part 4: \"sno🐶\" → \"snow\". Correct. Part 3: \"a🐷\" → a [🐷]. Let's think of \"a\" followed by a letter. Maybe \"an\", \"as\", \"at\", \"am\", \"ap\", etc. Let's see part 3 in context. The sentence so far:\n\nta[xx] defeated a[🐷] snow (5:20) ta[xx] forced snow to submit with the ta[xx]mission.\n\nSo \"ta[xx] defeated a[🐷] snow...\" Maybe \"tank defeated a...\" \"task defeated a...\" \"team defeated a...\" Let's see part 13: \"ta[xx]mission\" → maybe \"teamission\"? No. \"taskmission\"? No. \"transmission\" (as before) is \"transmission\". Let's think of \"transmission\" again. \"Transmission\" is t-r-a-n-s-mission. So \"trans\" + \"mission\" → \"transmission\". So \"ta\" [n][s] mission → \"tansmission\"? No. Alternatively, \"ta\" [n][s] is \"tans\", which is not right. Maybe \"ta\" [s][k] → \"task\", then \"taskmission\"? No. Alternatively, \"ta\" [l][k] → \"talkmission\"? No.\n\nLet's check part 1 again. The first word is \"ta[🐼][🐼]\". Let's think of 4-letter words starting with \"ta\": \"tact\", \"taco\", \"tadp\", \"tads\", \"tale\", \"talk\", \"tall\", \"tame\", \"tamp\", \"tank\", \"tans\", \"tapa\", \"tape\", \"tarp\", \"task\", \"tass\", \"tate\", \"tats\", \"tava\", \"tawd\", \"taws\", \"tawk\", \"tawl\", \"tawp\", \"taws\", \"taxy\", \"tazes\", etc. Let's think of possible words that fit in the sentence.\n\nThe sentence structure: \"ta[xx] defeated a[yy] snow... ta[xx] forced snow to submit with the ta[xx]mission.\" So \"ta[xx]\" is probably a noun, maybe a code name or a thing. Let's think of \"tank\" → \"Tank defeated a...\" \"Tank forced snow...\" \"Tank transmission\"? Maybe. Alternatively, \"task\" → \"Task defeated a...\" \"Task forced snow...\" \"Task mission\"? \"Task mission\" could make sense. \"Task mission\" is a possible phrase. So \"ta[xx]mission\" would be \"taskmission\"? Not exactly. Alternatively, \"tank\" and \"tank mission\" → \"Tank mission\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"ta[xx]\" is \"term\". \"term\" → \"term defeated a...\" \"term forced snow...\" \"term mission\"? Not sure. Let's check part 13 again: \"ta[xx]mission\" → \"ta[xx]mission\" is a longer word. Let's think of \"transmission\" again. \"Transmission\" is 12 letters. Let's count: t-r-a-n-s-m-i-s-s-i-o-n. That's 12 letters. The part is \"ta[xx]mission\" → \"ta\" + [xx] + \"mission\". \"mission\" is 7 letters. So \"ta[xx]mission\" is 2 + 2 + 7 = 11 letters. \"transmission\" is 12 letters. So that doesn't fit. Let's count the characters in part 13: \"😍a🐼🐼🐦ission\" → t a [🐼][🐼] m i s s i o n. So \"ta[xx]mission\" → letters: t, a, [xx], m, i, s, s, i, o, n. That's 10 letters. \"transmission\" is t, r, a, n, s, m, i, s, s, i, o, n → 12 letters. So that's longer. Maybe \"ta[xx]mission\" is \"tactmission\"? No. \"talisman\"? No. Let's think of other possibilities.\n\nLet's look at part 3: \"a🐷\" → \"a\" + [🐷]. Let's suppose part 3 is \"a man\" → but \"a\" + [🐷] = \"am\" if 🐷=m. But in the first attempt, 🐷 was guessed as 'n' and feedback was False, so 🐷≠n. So \"a🐷\" could be \"as\" (if 🐷=s), \"at\" (🐷=t, but 😍=t already, so no), \"an\" (🐷=n, but first attempt had 🐷=n as False), \"ap\" (🐷=p), \"ab\" (🐷=b), etc. Let's think of the sentence: \"ta[xx] defeated a[yy] snow...\" So \"a[yy] snow\" → maybe \"a band of snow\"? No. \"a pile of snow\"? \"a drift of snow\"? \"a patch of snow\"? Alternatively, \"a man in snow\"? Not sure. Let's think of \"a[yy] snow\" as \"a [yy] snow\". Maybe \"a fresh snow\"? \"a light snow\"? \"a heavy snow\"? So [yy] could be an adjective. But \"a\" + [yy] is two letters. So \"a\" + [yy] → \"al\" (if 🐷=l), \"as\" (s), \"ap\" (p), \"ab\" (b), etc. Let's suppose \"a\" + \"s\" → \"as\" → \"as snow\". That's possible. So \"ta[xx] defeated as snow...\" Maybe not. Alternatively, \"a\" + \"b\" → \"ab\" → \"ab snow\" (unlikely). \n\nLet's go back to the first attempt feedback. The first guess was 🐼=l (False), so 🐼≠l. 🐸=e (False), so 🐸≠e. 🐷=n (False), so 🐷≠n. So in the first attempt, 🐸 was guessed as 'e' and it was wrong. So our earlier thought that 🐸=d is possible (since 'e' was wrong). Let's confirm that. The first attempt's guess for 🐸 was 'e' → feedback was False. So 🐸≠e. So in part 2, \"🐸e😈ea😍e🐸\" → if 🐸=d, then it's \"defeated\", which is a valid word, and that's 8 letters. That makes sense. So let's go with 🐸=d.\n\nNow, part 7: \"😈orce🐸\" → \"force\" + 🐸. If 🐸=d, then \"forced\" → which is correct. So that's a good fit.\n\nPart 1: \"ta[🐼][🐼]\". Let's look at part 12: \"😍he\" → \"the\" (since 😍=t → the). Correct. So \"the ta[xx]mission\" → \"the [ta[xx]mission]\". Let's think of \"ta[xx]mission\" as \"tacticalmission\"? No. Maybe \"talisman\" → no. Alternatively, \"ta[xx]\" could be \"sk\" → \"task\". \"task mission\" → \"taskmission\"? Not a word, but maybe in context. Let's check part 1: \"ta[xx]\" and part 6: \"ta[xx]\" (since part 6 is the same as part 1). So \"ta[xx] defeated a[yy] snow... ta[xx] forced snow to submit with the ta[xx]mission.\" So \"ta[xx]\" is repeated. Maybe \"tank\" → \"Tank defeated a... Tank forced snow... the Tank mission.\" That could work. So \"ta[xx]\" = \"tank\" → \"ta\" + \"nk\" → 🐼=n and 🐼=k. Wait, but each emoji is a unique letter. Oh, right! Each emoji represents a unique letter. So 🐼 is a single emoji, so [🐼][🐼] would be two of the same letters. Wait, no. Wait, the encoded sentence has \"😍a🐼🐼\" → that's t a [🐼] [🐼]. So the two 🐼 emojis are the same, so they represent the same letter. So \"ta[xx]\" where xx is the same letter. So \"ta\" + [same letter] + [same letter]. So \"ta\" followed by two of the same letter. So 4-letter words: \"tall\" (t a l l), \"trap\" (no, two same letters), \"tass\" (t a s s), \"tatt\" (t a t t), \"toll\" (t o l l, but here it's \"ta\" so no), \"tamm\" (t a m m), \"tabb\" (t a b b), etc. So possible words: tall, tass, tatt, tamm, tabb, etc.\n\nLet's check \"tall\". So \"ta[xx] = tall\" → 🐼=l. But in the first attempt, 🐼 was guessed as 'l' and feedback was False (🐼: False). So 🐼≠l. So \"tall\" is out.\n\nNext, \"tass\" → t a s s → 🐼=s. So if 🐼=s, then \"ta[xx]\" is \"tass\". Let's check part 13: \"ta[xx]mission\" → \"tassmission\"? No. \"tass\" + \"mission\" → \"tassmission\" (not a word). \n\nNext, \"tatt\" → t a t t. But 😍=t, so 🐼=t would mean duplicate, which isn't allowed. So no.\n\nNext, \"tamm\" → t a m m. 🐼=m. But 🐦=m (from the first attempt, feedback 🐦=m is True). So 🐼 can't be m, since each emoji is unique. So 🐼≠m.\n\nNext, \"tabb\" → t a b b. So 🐼=b. Let's see if that works. Then \"ta[xx] = tabb\". \"tabb defeated a[yy] snow...\" Maybe. \"tabb forced snow...\" \"the tabbmission\" → \"tabbmission\" (not a word). Not great.\n\nNext, \"tarp\" → no, two same letters. \"tact\" → no. \"taco\" → no. \"tads\" → t a d s. No, two different letters. So the structure requires two of the same letters. So \"ta\" + [same letter] ×2.\n\nAnother possibility: \"task\" → t a s k (different letters). So that's not possible. \"tank\" → t a n k (different letters). \"tape\" → t a p e (different). So perhaps \"ta[xx]\" is a 4-letter word with two of the same letters. Let's think of \"toll\" → t o l l (but starts with 'to', not 'ta'). \"tall\" we already ruled out. \"tass\" (t a s s), \"tatt\" (t a t t), \"tabb\" (t a b b), \"tamm\" (t a m m), \"tupp\" (unlikely). \n\nLet's think of part 13 again: \"ta[xx]mission\". If \"ta[xx]\" is \"trans\", then \"transmission\" → t r a n s m i s s i o n. But \"trans\" is t r a n s, which is 5 letters. \"ta[xx]\" is 4 letters (t a [xx]). So \"ta\" + [xx] would be \"tr\" + \"an\"? No, because [xx] is two letters. So \"ta\" + \"ns\" → \"tans\" → \"tansmission\"? No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"ta[xx]\" is \"term\" → t e r m (different letters). No. \"test\" → t e s t (different). \n\nLet's look at the sentence again with the knowns and the assumed 🐸=d:\n\nEncoded sentence after substitution:\n\nta[🐼][🐼] defeated a[🐷] snow (5:20) ta[🐼][🐼] forced snow to submit with the ta[🐼][🐼]mission.\n\nSo \"ta[xx] defeated a[yy] snow... ta[xx] forced snow to submit with the ta[xx]mission.\"\n\nThe phrase \"submit with the ta[xx]mission\" → maybe \"submit with the transmission\" (if ta[xx] is \"trans\", but that's 5 letters). Alternatively, \"submit with the task mission\" (but task is 4 letters). Alternatively, \"submit with the tank mission\".\n\nWait, \"submit with the [ta[xx]mission]\" → maybe \"submit with the main mission\"? No. Let's think of \"transmission\" again. If \"ta[xx]mission\" is \"transmission\", then \"ta[xx]\" would need to be \"trans\" (t r a n s). But \"ta[xx]\" is t a [xx], which is 4 letters (t, a, [xx]). So \"trans\" is 5 letters. So that's not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"ta[xx]mission\" is \"tacticalmission\" → but that's too long. \n\nLet's try to find another angle. Let's look at part 3: \"a🐷\". The first attempt guessed 🐷=n (False), so 🐷≠n. Let's think of possible letters. Let's suppose \"a🐷\" is \"as\" → 🐷=s. Then \"a🐷\" = \"as\". So \"ta[xx] defeated as snow...\" Maybe \"Tall defeated as snow...\" No. \"Tass defeated as snow...\" Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, \"a🐷\" could be \"at\" → 🐷=t, but 😍=t, so duplicate. Not allowed. \"am\" → 🐷=m, but 🐦=m (True), so duplicate. \"ap\" → 🐷=p. \"ab\" → 🐷=b. \"aq\" → 🐷=q. \"ar\" → 🐷=r. \"aw\" → 🐷=w, but 🐶=w (True). \"ax\" → 🐷=x. \"ay\" → 🐷=y. \"az\" → 🐷=z. So possible options for 🐷: p, b, q, r, x, y, z, etc.\n\nLet's think of \"ta[xx] defeated a[yy] snow\". If \"a[yy]\" is \"a band\", but \"a\" + [yy] is two letters. So \"ab\" → \"ab\" snow (unlikely). \"ap\" → \"ap\" snow (unlikely). \"ar\" → \"ar\" snow (like \"arctic snow\"? No, \"ar\" is not an adjective). \"as\" → \"as snow\" (maybe \"as snow falls\"? Not sure). \n\nLet's go back to the first attempt's feedback. The correct emojis are 😍=t, 😈=f, 🐶=w, 🐦=m. The incorrect ones are 🐼, 🐸, 🐷. We think 🐸=d (since \"defeated\" fits). Let's check if that's possible. The first attempt guessed 🐸=e (False), so 🐸=d is possible.\n\nNow, let's summarize the known and possible:\n\n😍=t (correct)\n😈=f (correct)\n🐶=w (correct)\n🐦=m (correct)\n🐸=d (our guess)\n🐼=?\n🐷=?\n\nWe need to guess all emojis, including the correct ones from history. The answer must include all emojis, including the hint and previously correct ones.\n\nLet's check the sentence again with 🐸=d:\n\nEncoded Sentence parts with substitutions:\n\n1. ta[🐼][🐼] → 4 letters: t a [x][x]\n2. defeated → correct (if 🐸=d)\n3. a[🐷] → a [y]\n4. snow → correct\n5. (5:20) → unchanged\n6. ta[🐼][🐼] → same as part 1\n7. forced → correct (if 🐸=d)\n8. snow → correct\n9. to → correct\n10. submit → correct (🐦=m, 😍=t)\n11. with → correct (🐶=w, 😍=t)\n12. the → correct\n13. ta[🐼][🐼]mission → t a [x][x] m i s s i o n → 10 letters: t a x x m i s s i o n\n\nLet's think of \"ta[xx]mission\" as \"tactmission\" → no. \"talisman\"? No. \"tamarindmission\"? No. Maybe \"ta[xx]mission\" is \"tankmission\" → t a n k m i s s i o n. But that's 11 letters (t a n k m i s s i o n). Our part 13 has 10 letters (t a [x][x] m i s s i o n). So 2 (ta) + 2 (xx) + 6 (mission) → 10 letters. \"mission\" is 7 letters (m i s s i o n), so 2 + 2 + 7 = 11 letters. Oh, perhaps I miscounted. Let's recount: \"😍a🐼🐼🐦ission\" → 😍=t, a, 🐼, 🐼, 🐦=m, i, s, s, i, o, n. That's 11 characters: t, a, [x], [x], m, i, s, s, i, o, n. So \"ta[x][x]mission\" → 11 letters. \"transmission\" is t, r, a, n, s, m, i, s, s, i, o, n → 12 letters. So no. \"tactmission\" → t, a, c, t, m, i, s, s, i, o, n → 11 letters. Oh! \"tactmission\" is 11 letters. \"tact\" + \"mission\" → \"tactmission\". So \"ta[x][x]mission\" → \"t a c t m i s s i o n\". So [x][x] would be \"c t\". But 🐼 is a single emoji, so [x][x] must be two of the same letters. So \"tact\" has 'c' and 't' (different), so that's not possible. \n\nAnother 11-letter word: \"talisman\" → no. \"tamarind\" → no. \"tambourine\" → no. Maybe \"tassmission\" → t a s s m i s s i o n. That's 11 letters. \"tass\" + \"mission\" → \"tassmission\". So \"ta[x][x]mission\" = \"t a s s m i s s i o n\". So [x][x] is \"s s\". So 🐼=s. Let's check that. If 🐼=s, then part 1: \"ta[xx]\" is \"tass\". \"tass defeated a[yy] snow... tass forced snow to submit with the tassmission.\" \"Tass\" could be a name or code. \"Tassmission\" could be a mission named Tass. That's possible. \n\nLet's check if 🐼=s is possible. The first attempt guessed 🐼=l (False), so 🐼=s is possible (since it's not l). So let's assume 🐼=s. Then part 1 is \"tass\", part 6 is \"tass\", part 13 is \"tassmission\". \n\nNow, part 3: \"a🐷\". Let's see. The sentence is \"tass defeated a[yy] snow... tass forced snow to submit with the tassmission.\" What could \"a[yy] snow\" be? Maybe \"a fresh snow\"? \"a light snow\"? \"a heavy snow\"? \"a new snow\"? \"a soft snow\"? So [yy] would be an adjective. \"a\" + [yy] → \"af\" (if 🐷=f, but 😈=f), \"al\" (🐷=l), \"as\" (🐷=s, but 🐼=s), \"ap\" (p), \"ab\" (b), \"aq\" (q), \"ar\" (r), \"aw\" (w, but 🐶=w), \"ax\" (x), \"ay\" (y), \"az\" (z). \n\nIf \"a[yy] snow\" is \"a new snow\", then [yy] = \"ne\" → but \"a\" + \"ne\" is \"ane\", which is not a word. \"a new\" is two words. So maybe \"a fresh snow\" → \"a fresh\" → \"a\" + \"fr\" → \"afr\" → no. \n\nAlternatively, \"a[yy] snow\" could be \"a band of snow\" → but \"a band\" is two words. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"a[yy]\" is a noun. \"a man\" → \"am\" (if 🐷=m, but 🐦=m). \"a boy\" → \"ab\" (if 🐷=b). \"a dog\" → \"ad\" (if 🐷=d, but 🐸=d). \"a cat\" → \"ac\" (if 🐷=c). \n\nLet's suppose \"a[yy] snow\" is \"a cat snow\" → \"ac snow\" (unlikely). \"a dog snow\" → \"ad snow\" (unlikely). \"a boy snow\" → \"ab snow\" (unlikely). \"a man snow\" → \"am snow\" (unlikely). \n\nAlternatively, \"a[yy]\" could be a verb. \"a run\" → \"ar\" (if 🐷=r). \"a walk\" → \"aw\" (but 🐶=w). \"a jump\" → \"aj\" (if 🐷=j). \n\nAlternatively, \"a[yy]\" could be part of a larger phrase. Maybe \"a storm of snow\" → \"a storm\" → \"as\" (if 🐷=s, but 🐼=s). \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"a[yy]\" is \"a blizzard\" → but that's longer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"a[yy]\" is \"a patch\" → \"ap\" (if 🐷=p). \"a patch of snow\". So \"a patch snow\" → not quite, but \"a patch\" could be part of it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"a[yy]\" is \"a pile\" → \"ap\" (if 🐷=p). \"a pile of snow\". \n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"a[yy]\" is \"a drift\" → \"ad\" (if 🐷=d, but 🐸=d). \n\nThis part is tricky. Let's think of other parts. Let's look at the entire sentence structure again:\n\nEncoded Sentence: \"😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission.\"\n\nWith substitutions:\n\n\"ta[xx] defeated a[yy] snow (5:20) ta[xx] forced snow to submit with the ta[xx]mission.\"\n\nThe phrase \"submit with the ta[xx]mission\" → maybe \"submit with the main mission\" → but \"main\" is not matching. Alternatively, \"submit with the final mission\". \n\nAlternatively, \"ta[xx]mission\" could be \"tassmission\" (if 🐼=s). Let's proceed with that. So 🐼=s. \n\nNow, what about 🐷? Let's think of \"a[yy]\". If \"ta[xx] defeated a[yy] snow\" → \"tass defeated a[yy] snow\". Maybe \"tass defeated a band snow\" → \"ab\" → \"ab snow\". But \"ab\" isn't a word. \"tass defeated a pack snow\" → \"ap\" → \"ap snow\". Not great. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"a[yy]\" is \"an\" → but 🐷=n was guessed as False. \"a[yy]\" could be \"as\" → \"as\" snow. \"tass defeated as snow...\" Maybe \"as\" in the sense of \"while\" → \"tass defeated as snow...\" Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"a[yy]\" is \"at\" → \"at\" snow. \"tass defeated at snow...\" Doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"a[yy]\" is \"of\" → but \"a of\" is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, \"a[yy]\" could be a typo or part of a code. Maybe \"a[yy]\" is \"ax\" → \"ax\" snow. Unlikely. \n\nAt this point, perhaps we need to make a guess for 🐷. Let's assume that 🐷=b. So \"a🐷\" = \"ab\". Then \"tass defeated ab snow...\" Maybe \"ab\" is a code or abbreviation. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of \"a🐷\" as \"ap\" → \"ap\" snow. Maybe \"ap\" is a typo for \"a patch\". \n\nAlternatively, perhaps 🐷=r. So \"a🐷\" = \"ar\". \"tass defeated ar snow...\" Maybe \"ar\" is a code. \n\nSince we need to make a guess, let's proceed with the following:\n\n😍=t (correct)\n😈=f (correct)\n🐶=w (correct)\n🐦=m (correct)\n🐸=d (our guess, fits \"defeated\" and \"forced\")\n🐼=s (our guess, makes \"tass\" and \"tassmission\")\n🐷=b (our guess, \"ab\" as a possible code)\n\nLet's check if these fit:\n\nEncoded sentence with all substitutions:\n\n😍=t → t\n🐼=s → s\n🐸=d → d\n😈=f → f\n🐷=b → b\n🐶=w → w\n🐦=m → m\n\nSo the sentence becomes:\n\n\"ta ss defeated a b snow (5:20) ta ss forced snow to submit with the ta ss mission.\"\n\nWhich is: \"tass defeated ab snow (5:20) tass forced snow to submit with the tass mission.\"\n\nThat makes sense in a coded context. \"Tass\" could be a code name, \"ab\" a shorthand, and \"tass mission\" the mission name. So this seems plausible.\n\nTo solve the Crypto Word Game, we analyze the encoded sentence, known hints, and feedback from previous attempts. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Known Correct Emojis (from History):\n- 😍=t (given hint)\n- 😈=f (feedback: True)\n- 🐶=w (feedback: True)\n- 🐦=m (feedback: True)\n\n### Analysis of the Encoded Sentence:\nThe encoded sentence is:  \n`😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission`  \n\nSubstituting known emojis:  \n`ta🐼🐼 🐸efeat🐸 a🐷 snow (5: 20) ta🐼🐼 force🐸 snow to submit with the ta🐼🐼mission`  \n\n### Deductions:\n1. **🐸**: The phrase `🐸efeat🐸` (7-8 characters) likely forms \"defeated\" (8 letters: d-e-f-e-a-t-e-d). Thus, `🐸=d`.  \n2. **🐼**: The repeated `ta🐼🐼` and `ta🐼🐼mission` suggest a 4-letter word starting with \"ta\" and ending with two identical letters. \"tass\" (t-a-s-s) fits, making `ta🐼🐼 = tass` and `ta🐼🐼mission = tassmission`. Thus, `🐼=s`.  \n3. **🐷**: The phrase `a🐷` (2 characters) is likely a short word like \"ab\" (a-b) in a coded context. Thus, `🐷=b`.  \n\n### Final Guesses:\nAll emojis, including known and deduced ones, are:  \n😍=t, 🐼=s, 🐸=d, 😈=f, 🐷=b, 🐶=w, 🐦=m.\n\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐼=s,🐸=d,😈=f,🐷=b,🐶=w,🐦=m","Okay, let's try to figure this out step by step. First, let's list out what we know from the history and the hint. The hint says 😍=t, which is confirmed in both attempts. The feedback from the first attempt: 😈=f (True), 🐶=w (True), 🐦=m (True). The second attempt: 🐸=d (True). So the correct mappings we have so far are:\n\n😍=t, 😈=f, 🐶=w, 🐦=m, 🐸=d.\n\nNow, let's look at the encoded sentence with these known emojis. Let's substitute them first:\n\nEncoded Sentence: 😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission.\n\nSubstituting known emojis:\n\nt a 🐼🐼 d e f e a t e d a 🐷 s n o w (5: 20) t a 🐼🐼 f o r c e d s n o w t o s u b m i t w i t h t h e t a 🐼🐼 m i s s i o n.\n\nLet's break this down into parts. Let's look at the first part: \"t a 🐼🐼 d e f e a t e d a 🐷 s n o w\"\n\nThe phrase \"d e f e a t e d\" is \"defeated\" which makes sense. So \"t a 🐼🐼\" must be a word that comes before \"defeated\". Let's see: \"t a [two letters] defeated a [something] snow\". Maybe \"t a [word] defeated a [word] snow\".\n\nAnother part: \"t a 🐼🐼 f o r c e d s n o w\" — \"t a [two letters] forced snow\". The word \"forced\" here. So \"t a 🐼🐼\" is the same as in the first part. Let's consider that \"t a 🐼🐼\" could be \"task\" (t-a-s-k) but 🐼 was guessed as 's' in attempt 2, which was wrong (feedback said 🐼: False). Wait, attempt 1 guessed 🐼=l (False), attempt 2 guessed 🐼=s (False). So 🐼 is not s or l.\n\nWhat's a two-letter word starting with 'a' (since \"t a 🐼🐼\" would be t followed by a and then two letters from 🐼, so the structure is t a [🐼][🐼]. So the word is \"ta\" + 🐼🐼. Let's think: \"t a [two letters]\" as a word. For example, \"tact\" (t-a-c-t) but that's 4 letters. Wait, maybe the structure is different. Let's look at the sentence structure again. Let's split the encoded sentence into words:\n\n1. 😍a🐼🐼 → t a 🐼🐼 → 4 letters (t, a, 🐼, 🐼)\n2. 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 → d e f e a t e d → 8 letters (d, e, f, e, a, t, e, d) → \"defeated\" (which matches 8 letters)\n3. a🐷 → a 🐷 → 2 letters (a, 🐷)\n4. sno🐶 → s n o w → \"snow\" (correct, since 🐶=w)\nThen (5:20) is probably a time or score, not relevant.\n5. 😍a🐼🐼 → same as first word: t a 🐼🐼\n6. 😈orce🐸 → f o r c e d → \"forced\" (f, o, r, c, e, d) → 6 letters, which matches \"forced\" (6 letters)\n7. sno🐶 → snow\n8. 😍o → t o → \"to\"\n9. sub🐦i😍 → s u b m i t → \"submit\" (s, u, b, m, i, t) → 6 letters, correct (since 🐦=m and 😍=t)\n10. 🐶i😍h → w i t h → \"with\" (w, i, t, h) → 4 letters, correct\n11. 😍he → t h e → \"the\" (t, h, e) → 3 letters, correct\n12. 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission → t a 🐼🐼 m i s s i o n → Let's see: \"t a [two letters] m i s s i o n\". The full word here would be \"ta[🐼][🐼]mission\". Let's count letters: t (1), a (2), 🐼 (3), 🐼 (4), m (5), i (6), s (7), s (8), i (9), o (10), n (11). So 11 letters. Maybe \"taskmission\"? No, that's not right. Alternatively, \"tactical mission\"? No, but the structure here is \"ta[🐼][🐼]mission\". Let's think of a word like \"tactical\" but that's 8 letters. Alternatively, \"target mission\"? \"target\" is 6 letters (t-a-r-g-e-t). So \"target mission\" would be t a r g e t m i s s i o n. Let's check: t a 🐼🐼 m i s s i o n. If 🐼🐼 is \"r g\", then \"target mission\". That would make sense. Let's check other parts.\n\nLooking at the first word: \"t a 🐼🐼\" → if 🐼=r and 🐼=g, then \"t a r g\" → \"targ\"? Not a word. Alternatively, \"t a s k\" (task) but attempt 2 had 🐼=s (False). Hmm. Let's look at the third word: \"a🐷\" → a + 🐷. The sentence after \"defeated a 🐷 snow\" → \"defeated a [something] snow\". Maybe \"defeated a big snow\" → but \"a big\" would be a + big, but \"a🐷\" is two letters (a and 🐷). So \"a🐷\" is a two-letter word. Possible options: \"a\" followed by a letter, like \"an\", \"at\", \"as\", \"am\", \"ax\". Let's see. If \"a🐷\" is \"an\", then 🐷=n. But attempt 1 guessed 🐷=n (feedback: False). So 🐷 is not n. Attempt 2 guessed 🐷=b (False). So not b.\n\nLooking at the first part again: \"t a 🐼🐼 d e f e a t e d a 🐷 s n o w\" → \"ta[🐼][🐼] defeated a [🐷] snow\". Let's think of \"tavern\"? No, \"tavern defeated...\" No. \"tactic defeated...\" \"tactic\" is t-a-c-t-i-c, but the first word is 4 letters (t,a,🐼,🐼). So 4 letters: \"t a [x][y]\". Maybe \"team\"? t-a-e-m? But the second part is \"defeated a [something] snow\". \"Team defeated a ... snow\". Possible. Let's check the other occurrence: \"t a 🐼🐼 f o r c e d s n o w\" → \"team forced snow\" → \"team forced snow\" makes sense. Then \"t a 🐼🐼\" would be \"team\" (t-e-a-m) but no, \"t a 🐼🐼\" is t, a, 🐼, 🐼. So \"ta\" followed by two letters. \"tank\" (t-a-n-k). \"Tank defeated a ... snow\"? Maybe. \"Tank forced snow\" → possible. Let's check the last part: \"t a 🐼🐼 m i s s i o n\" → \"tank mission\" → \"tank mission\" makes sense. So if 🐼=n and 🐼=k, then \"t a n k\" → \"tank\". Let's check if that works.\n\nSo if 🐼=n, then let's check the first attempt: attempt 1 guessed 🐼=l (False) → correct, since we're thinking n. Attempt 2 guessed 🐼=s (False) → correct. So possible. Let's check:\n\nIf 🐼=n, then the first word is \"t a n n\"? No, \"t a n n\" is \"tann\" which isn't a word. Oh, wait, the emoji is repeated, so 🐼 is the same emoji, so both instances are the same letter. So \"t a 🐼🐼\" is t, a, 🐼, 🐼 → so the word is 4 letters, with the third and fourth letters being the same (since it's two 🐼). So \"ta\" + 🐼 + 🐼. So \"taaa\" (no), \"tabb\" (tabby? No, 5 letters), \"tacc\" (no), \"tadd\" (tadd?), \"taff\" (taffy? No), \"tagg\" (tag?), \"tagg\" is 4 letters: t-a-g-g. \"Tagg\" could be a name, but maybe not. \"tall\" (t-a-l-l) → \"tall\". Let's check: \"tall defeated a [something] snow\". \"Tall defeated a ... snow\". That could work. Let's see: \"tall forced snow\" → \"tall forced snow\" makes sense. \"tall submit with the tall mission\" → \"tall mission\" could make sense. Let's check the first attempt: attempt 1 guessed 🐼=l (feedback: False). Oh, so if 🐼=l, then the feedback said False, so that's not possible. So \"tall\" is out.\n\nAnother possibility: \"trap\" (t-a-r-p) → but that's 4 letters. \"trap defeated a ... snow\". \"Trap forced snow\" → possible. But the third and fourth letters are different, but the emoji is the same, so they need to be the same letter. Oh right, because it's two of the same emoji, so the letters must be the same. So the structure is t-a-X-X, where X is the same letter. So \"taXX\".\n\nAnother option: \"tass\" (t-a-s-s). \"Tass\" is a name or abbreviation. \"Tass defeated a ... snow\". \"Tass forced snow\". Then \"tass mission\" → \"tass mission\". But attempt 2 guessed 🐼=s (False), so X can't be s.\n\n\"tazz\"? Not a word. \"tubb\"? No. \"tuck\"? No, that's t-u-c-k, different letters. \"toll\"? t-o-l-l. But the first two letters are t-a, so \"ta\" not \"to\". So \"ta\" + same letters. \"taffy\" is 5 letters, but we need 4. \"taff\" (t-a-f-f). \"Taff\" could be a name. Let's check if 🐼=f. But 😈=f is already taken (from feedback, 😈=f is correct). So no, can't have two emojis mapping to f.\n\nHmm. Let's look at another part. The third word is \"a🐷\" → two letters, a + 🐷. Let's see the sentence after \"defeated a 🐷 snow\". What's a two-letter word that fits here? \"a big\" no, but \"a\" + one letter. \"a\" + \"n\" → \"an\", but attempt 1 guessed 🐷=n (False). \"a\" + \"d\" → \"ad\" (advertisement), but \"defeated a ad snow\" doesn't make sense. \"a\" + \"k\" → \"ak\" (not a word). \"a\" + \"p\" → \"ap\" (no). \"a\" + \"c\" → \"ac\" (no). \"a\" + \"b\" → \"ab\" (no). \"a\" + \"m\" → \"am\" (but \"defeated a am snow\" → no). \"a\" + \"t\" → \"at\" → \"defeated a at snow\" → no. \"a\" + \"s\" → \"as\" → \"defeated a as snow\" → no. \"a\" + \"w\" → \"aw\" → \"defeated a aw snow\" → no. \"a\" + \"x\" → \"ax\" → \"defeated a ax snow\" → maybe \"defeated a ax snow\" → \"ax\" is a tool. Possible. So if 🐷=x, then \"a🐷\" is \"ax\".\n\nLet's try that. So 🐷=x. Then \"defeated a ax snow\" → \"defeated a ax snow\" → maybe \"defeated a (an) ax (axe) in the snow\". Not perfect, but possible. Let's check if that works elsewhere.\n\nAnother part: \"sub🐦i😍\" → \"subm i t\" (since 🐦=m and 😍=t) → \"submit\" (s-u-b-m-i-t), which is correct. That's 6 letters, and \"submit\" fits. Good.\n\n\"🐶i😍h\" → \"w i t h\" → \"with\" (correct, 4 letters). \"😍he\" → \"t h e\" → \"the\" (correct, 3 letters). All of these check out.\n\nNow, back to \"t a 🐼🐼\". Let's look at the part \"t a 🐼🐼 f o r c e d s n o w\" → \"taXX forced snow\". If \"forced snow\" is part of the sentence, maybe \"taXX\" is a verb. \"Task forced snow\"? No, \"task\" is noun. \"Tact forced snow\"? \"Tact\" is noun. \"Tank forced snow\" → possible. But \"tank\" is t-a-n-k (different letters, but we need two same letters). Oh, wait, the emoji is 🐼 repeated, so the letters must be the same. So \"taXX\" where XX is same letters. Let's think of \"taffy\" but that's 5 letters. \"Taff\" (4 letters) → \"taff forced snow\". Not great. \"Tall\" (t-a-l-l) but attempt 1 guessed 🐼=l (False), so can't be l.\n\nAnother angle: let's look at the last part: \"😍a🐼🐼🐦ission\" → \"t a 🐼🐼 m i s s i o n\" → \"taXXmission\". Let's count the letters: t(1), a(2), 🐼(3), 🐼(4), m(5), i(6), s(7), s(8), i(9), o(10), n(11). So 11 letters. A possible word here could be \"tactical mission\" (t-a-c-t-i-c-a-l m-i-s-s-i-o-n) but that's longer. Alternatively, \"target mission\" (t-a-r-g-e-t m-i-s-s-i-o-n) → 6 + 7 =13 letters. Not matching. \"Tandem mission\"? t-a-n-d-e-m m-i-s-s-i-o-n → 6 + 7=13. No. \"Tamarind mission\"? No. \"Tamar\" mission? t-a-m-a-r m-i-s-s-i-o-n → 5 +7=12. Not 11. \n\nAlternatively, \"taXXmission\" could be \"tact mission\" (t-a-c-t m-i-s-s-i-o-n) → 4 +7=11 letters. Oh! \"tact mission\" → t(1), a(2), c(3), t(4), m(5), i(6), s(7), s(8), i(9), o(10), n(11). That's 11 letters. So \"tact mission\" would fit. So \"t a 🐼🐼\" would be \"tact\" (t-a-c-t). But the emoji is 🐼 repeated twice, so the third and fourth letters are the same emoji. \"tact\" is t-a-c-t. So the third letter is c (🐼) and fourth is t (😍=t). Wait, but the fourth letter is 😍=t, which is already known. Let's check the original encoded word: 😍a🐼🐼 → t a 🐼 🐼. So the structure is t (😍), a, 🐼, 🐼. So the fourth letter is 🐼, not 😍. So \"tact\" would be t-a-c-t, but the fourth letter is t (😍), which is not the case here. The encoded word is 😍a🐼🐼 → t a 🐼 🐼, so the letters are t, a, 🐼, 🐼. So \"tact\" would require the fourth letter to be t (😍), but here it's 🐼. So that's not possible.\n\nAnother thought: \"tavern\" is 6 letters, no. \"Tattoo\" is 6 letters. \"Taffy\" 5 letters. \"Tacky\" 5 letters. \"Taff\" 4 letters (t-a-f-f). If 🐼=f, but 😈=f (True), so 🐼 can't be f. So that's out.\n\nLet's look at the second word again: 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 → d e f e a t e d → \"defeated\" (8 letters). That's correct. So the structure is correct here. So \"defeated\" is confirmed.\n\nThe first part: \"t a 🐼🐼 defeated a 🐷 snow\". Let's think of \"task defeated a ... snow\". \"Task\" is t-a-s-k. But attempt 2 guessed 🐼=s (False), so 🐼 can't be s. \"Tusk\" → t-u-s-k. But the second letter is a, not u. \"Tarp\" → t-a-r-p. \"Tarp defeated a ... snow\". Possible. \"Tarp forced snow\" → maybe. But again, the third and fourth letters are different, but the emoji is the same. So they need to be the same letter. So \"taXX\".\n\nWait, \"taXX\" could be \"tank\" but that's t-a-n-k (different letters). No. \"Tann\" → t-a-n-n. \"Tann defeated a ... snow\". \"Tann\" is a name. Possible. If 🐼=n, then \"t a n n\" → \"tann\". Let's check the first attempt: attempt 1 guessed 🐼=l (False) → okay. Attempt 2 guessed 🐼=s (False) → okay. So 🐼 could be n. Then \"tann\" would be the word. Let's check \"tann forced snow\" → \"tann forced snow\". Maybe \"Tann\" is a name. Then \"tann mission\" → \"tann mission\". It's a stretch, but possible.\n\nWhat about the third word \"a🐷\". If \"defeated a tann snow\" → \"a\" + 🐷 would be \"a tann\"? No, the structure is \"defeated a [word] snow\". So \"a [word]\" where [word] is two letters (since \"a🐷\" is two letters). So \"a big\" is three letters, \"a ax\" is two letters (a + ax). \"a ax\" → \"a ax\" → \"an ax\" maybe, but \"a\" + \"x\" would be \"ax\", but \"a ax\" is redundant. Alternatively, \"a [word]\" like \"a man\", but \"man\" is three letters. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"a🐷\" is \"an\" (a + n). But attempt 1 guessed 🐷=n (False), so 🐷 can't be n. \"a🐷\" could be \"as\" (a + s). Attempt 2 didn't guess s for 🐷, but let's see. If 🐷=s, then \"a🐷\" is \"as\". \"defeated as snow\" → doesn't make sense. \"a🐷\" could be \"at\" (a + t). \"defeated at snow\" → \"defeated at snow\" → maybe a location. Possible.\n\nLet's recap the known mappings:\n\n😍=t (correct)\n😈=f (correct)\n🐶=w (correct)\n🐦=m (correct)\n🐸=d (correct)\nNeed to find 🐼 and 🐷.\n\nLet's try to find 🐼 first. Let's look at the word \"😈orce🐸\" → f o r c e d → \"forced\" (correct). So that's 6 letters, which matches.\n\nThe word \"sub🐦i😍\" → s u b m i t → \"submit\" (correct, 6 letters).\n\nThe word \"🐶i😍h\" → w i t h → \"with\" (correct, 4 letters).\n\nThe word \"😍he\" → t h e → \"the\" (correct, 3 letters).\n\nThe word \"😍o\" → t o → \"to\" (correct, 2 letters).\n\nThe word \"sno🐶\" → s n o w → \"snow\" (correct, 4 letters).\n\nNow, the remaining unknowns are in the words:\n\n1. 😍a🐼🐼 → t a 🐼 🐼 (4 letters)\n2. a🐷 → a 🐷 (2 letters)\n3. 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission → t a 🐼 🐼 m i s s i o n (11 letters)\n\nLet's focus on the 11-letter word: \"t a 🐼 🐼 m i s s i o n\". Let's break it down: t a [🐼][🐼] m i s s i o n. Let's count the positions:\n\n1: t\n2: a\n3: 🐼\n4: 🐼\n5: m\n6: i\n7: s\n8: s\n9: i\n10: o\n11: n\n\nSo the word is positions 1-11. Let's think of a 11-letter word that starts with \"ta\", followed by two of the same letter, then \"mission\". For example, \"tactmission\" is 11 letters (t-a-c-t-m-i-s-s-i-o-n). Wait, that's 11 letters. Let's check:\n\nt(1), a(2), c(3), t(4), m(5), i(6), s(7), s(8), i(9), o(10), n(11). So yes, 11 letters. But in the encoded word, the fourth letter is 🐼, which would have to be t (since position 4 is t in \"tactmission\"). But 😍=t, so the fourth letter would be 😍, but in the encoded word, it's 🐼. So that's not possible. \n\nAnother example: \"tamarission\" → no. \"Tamar\" is 5 letters. \"Tamarission\" isn't a word. \"Talisman mission\"? No. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 11-letter word is \"tamarind mission\" but that's longer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"ta[🐼][🐼]\" is part of a compound word. Let's think of \"task mission\" → t-a-s-k m-i-s-s-i-o-n (6 + 7=13 letters). No. \"Tank mission\" → 4 +7=11? t-a-n-k m-i-s-s-i-o-n → 4+7=11 letters. Let's check:\n\nt(1), a(2), n(3), k(4), m(5), i(6), s(7), s(8), i(9), o(10), n(11). Yes, 11 letters. So \"tank mission\" would fit. Then \"ta[🐼][🐼]\" is \"tank\" (t-a-n-k). But the third and fourth letters are n and k (different letters), but the emoji is 🐼 repeated, so they need to be the same. So that's not possible.\n\nWait, maybe \"ta[🐼][🐼]\" is \"tall\" (t-a-l-l). Then \"tall mission\" → t-a-l-l m-i-s-s-i-o-n (4+7=11 letters). That works. Let's check:\n\nt(1), a(2), l(3), l(4), m(5), i(6), s(7), s(8), i(9), o(10), n(11). Yes, 11 letters. So \"tall mission\" would fit. But attempt 1 guessed 🐼=l (feedback: False). So 🐼 can't be l. So that's out.\n\nAnother possibility: \"taff mission\" → t-a-f-f m-i-s-s-i-o-n. But 😈=f, so 🐼 can't be f. \n\n\"tabb mission\" → t-a-b-b m-i-s-s-i-o-n. \"Tabb mission\". If 🐼=b, then let's check. Attempt 2 guessed 🐷=b (False), but that's for 🐷, not 🐼. So 🐼 could be b. Let's see:\n\nIf 🐼=b, then \"t a b b\" → \"tabb\". \"Tabb defeated a [something] snow\". \"Tabb forced snow\". \"Tabb mission\". Possible. Let's check the first attempt: attempt 1 guessed 🐼=l (False) → okay. Attempt 2 guessed 🐼=s (False) → okay. So 🐼=b is possible.\n\nNow, the third word: \"a🐷\" → a + 🐷. Let's say \"defeated a tabb snow\" → \"a tabb\" → \"a tabb\" doesn't make sense. Maybe \"defeated a [word] snow\" where the [word] is \"big\", but \"a big\" is three letters. \"a🐷\" is two letters, so \"a\" + 🐷 is two letters. Let's think of \"a\" + \"b\" → \"ab\" (no). \"a\" + \"c\" → \"ac\" (no). \"a\" + \"d\" → \"ad\" (advertisement). \"defeated a ad snow\" → possible. So if 🐷=d, then \"a🐷\"=ad. Let's check attempt 1: 🐷 was guessed as n (False). Attempt 2: 🐷 was guessed as b (False). So 🐷=d is possible.\n\nLet's try putting it all together:\n\n😍=t (correct)\n🐼=b (guessing)\n🐸=d (correct)\n😈=f (correct)\n🐷=d (guessing) → Wait, but 🐸=d (correct), so can't have two emojis mapping to d. Oh right, each emoji maps to a unique letter. So 🐷 can't be d because 🐸=d. So that's invalid.\n\nAlternative, 🐷=g. \"a🐷\"=ag (no). \"a🐷\"=h → ah (defeated a ah snow → no). \"a🐷\"=j → aj (no). \"a🐷\"=k → ak (no). \"a🐷\"=l → al (defeated a al snow → \"al\" as a name). Possible. \"a🐷\"=l → al. If 🐷=l, then \"a🐷\"=al. Let's check attempt 1: 🐷 was guessed as n (False). Attempt 2: 🐷 was guessed as b (False). So possible.\n\nIf 🐼=b, then \"t a b b\" → \"tabb\" (name). \"Tabb defeated a al snow\" → \"Tabb defeated a Al snow\" (Al as a name). That could work. \"Tabb forced snow\" → \"Tabb forced snow\". \"Tabb mission\" → \"Tabb mission\". It's a stretch, but possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"ta[🐼][🐼]\" is \"tact\" but that requires different letters, which isn't possible. \n\nLet's try another approach. Let's list all the emojis and their possible letters:\n\nEmojis present: 😍, 🐼, 🐸, 😈, 🐷, 🐶, 🐦.\n\nKnown mappings:\n😍=t\n🐸=d\n😈=f\n🐶=w\n🐦=m\n\nUnknown: 🐼, 🐷.\n\nWe need to find letters for 🐼 and 🐷 (unique, not already used: t, d, f, w, m are taken. So available letters: a, b, c, e, g, h, i, j, k, l, n, o, p, q, r, s, u, v, x, y, z).\n\nLet's look at the first word: t a 🐼 🐼 (4 letters). Let's think of 4-letter words starting with \"ta\" and having the third and fourth letters the same.\n\nPossible words:\n- Taff (t-a-f-f) → f is taken (😈=f)\n- Tabb (t-a-b-b) → possible\n- Tann (t-a-n-n) → possible\n- Tazz (t-a-z-z) → possible\n- Tatt (t-a-t-t) → t is taken (😍=t)\n- Tass (t-a-s-s) → s is possible (but attempt 2 guessed 🐼=s, feedback said False)\n- Tull (t-a-l-l) → l was guessed in attempt 1 (False)\n- Titt (t-a-t-t) → t taken\n- Togg (t-a-g-g) → possible\n- Tebb (t-a-b-b) → same as Tabb\n- Tobb (t-a-b-b) → same\n- Tupp (t-a-p-p) → possible\n\nLet's check Tann (t-a-n-n). If 🐼=n, then \"tann\" is the word. Let's check if \"tann\" makes sense in the sentence:\n\n\"tann defeated a [something] snow\" → \"Tann defeated a [something] snow\".\n\n\"tann forced snow\" → \"Tann forced snow\".\n\n\"tann mission\" → \"Tann mission\".\n\nPossible. Now, what about \"a🐷\" → a + 🐷. Let's think of \"a\" + \"k\" → \"ak\" (no). \"a\" + \"g\" → \"ag\" (no). \"a\" + \"h\" → \"ah\" (no). \"a\" + \"j\" → \"aj\" (no). \"a\" + \"p\" → \"ap\" (no). \"a\" + \"q\" → \"aq\" (no). \"a\" + \"r\" → \"ar\" (defeated a ar snow → \"ar\" as in \"area\" but no). \"a\" + \"u\" → \"au\" (no). \"a\" + \"v\" → \"av\" (no). \"a\" + \"x\" → \"ax\" (defeated a ax snow → possible, \"ax\" is a tool). \"a\" + \"y\" → \"ay\" (no). \"a\" + \"z\" → \"az\" (no). So \"ax\" is possible. So if 🐷=x, then \"a🐷\"=ax.\n\nLet's check if that works:\n\nEncoded Sentence with these guesses:\n\n😍=t, 🐼=n, 🐸=d, 😈=f, 🐷=x, 🐶=w, 🐦=m.\n\nSubstituting:\n\nt a n n d e f e a t e d a x s n o w (5: 20) t a n n f o r c e d s n o w t o s u b m i t w i t h t h e t a n n m i s s i o n.\n\nBreaking into words:\n\n1. tann (4 letters)\n2. defeated (8 letters)\n3. ax (2 letters)\n4. snow (4 letters)\n5. tann (4 letters)\n6. forced (6 letters)\n7. snow (4 letters)\n8. to (2 letters)\n9. submit (6 letters)\n10. with (4 letters)\n11. the (3 letters)\n12. tannmission (11 letters) → \"tann mission\" (but combined as one word? Maybe it's \"tann mission\" as two words, but the encoded sentence has it as one word: 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission → tannmission. Maybe it's a typo or a compound word. \"Tann mission\" makes sense as a mission named Tann.\n\nThis seems plausible. Let's check if the letters are unique. 🐼=n, 🐷=x. n and x are not in the known mappings (t, d, f, w, m). So that's valid.\n\nAnother check: in attempt 1, 🐼 was guessed as l (False) → correct, since we're guessing n. In attempt 2, 🐼 was guessed as s (False) → correct. 🐷 was guessed as n (attempt 1: False) and b (attempt 2: False) → correct, since we're guessing x.\n\nSo the guess would be 😍=t, 🐼=n, 🐸=d, 😈=f, 🐷=x, 🐶=w, 🐦=m.\n\nTo solve this Crypto Word Game, we start by analyzing the known information from the hint, history, and feedback. The confirmed mappings are: 😍=t, 😈=f, 🐶=w, 🐦=m, and 🐸=d. We need to determine the remaining emojis: 🐼 and 🐷.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Encoded Sentence Structure**: Substituting known emojis into the encoded sentence reveals partial words. For example, the phrase 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 becomes \"defeated\" (d-e-f-e-a-t-e-d), confirming 🐸=d and 😈=f. Similarly, sno🐶 becomes \"snow\" (s-n-o-w), confirming 🐶=w, and sub🐦i😍 becomes \"submit\" (s-u-b-m-i-t), confirming 🐦=m and 😍=t.\n\n2. **Unknown Emojis (🐼 and 🐷)**:\n   - The word 😍a🐼🐼 (t-a-🐼-🐼) appears multiple times. It must be a 4-letter word starting with \"ta\" and with the third and fourth letters identical (since 🐼 is repeated). Possible candidates include \"tann\" (t-a-n-n), as \"tann\" fits the structure and is a plausible name or term.\n   - The word a🐷 (a-🐷) is a 2-letter word. Given the context of \"defeated a [word] snow,\" \"ax\" (a-x) is a reasonable candidate, as \"ax\" is a tool and fits the 2-letter structure.\n\n### Verification:\n- **🐼=n**: The word 😍a🐼🐼 becomes \"tann,\" which fits in phrases like \"tann defeated a ax snow\" and \"tann forced snow.\"\n- **🐷=x**: The word a🐷 becomes \"ax,\" which fits in \"defeated a ax snow.\"\n\nThese mappings are consistent with the feedback from previous attempts (🐼 was not l or s, and 🐷 was not n or b) and ensure all emojis map to unique letters.\n\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐼=n,🐸=d,😈=f,🐷=x,🐶=w,🐦=m","Okay, let's try to figure out the current guesses. The encoded sentence is: 😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission.\n\nWe know that 😍=t from the hint, and the history tells us which emojis are correct. Let's list the confirmed ones first:\n\nFrom History 1: 😍=t (True), 😈=f (True), 🐶=w (True), 🐦=m (True).\nHistory 2: 🐸=d (True) because feedback says 🐸: True.\nHistory 3: same as 2 for 🐸, 😈, 🐶, 🐦. So confirmed emojis are 😍=t, 😈=f, 🐸=d, 🐶=w, 🐦=m.\n\nSo let's substitute those into the sentence:\n\n😍=t, so replace 😍 with t.\n😈=f, replace 😈 with f.\n🐸=d, replace 🐸 with d.\n🐶=w, replace 🐶 with w.\n🐦=m, replace 🐦 with m.\n\nNow the sentence becomes:\n\nt a 🐼🐼 d e f e a t e d a 🐷 s n o w (5: 20) t a 🐼🐼 f o r c e d s n o w t o s u b m i t w i t h t h e t a 🐼🐼 m i s s i o n.\n\nLet's parse this. Let's split into parts:\n\nFirst part: \"t a 🐼🐼 d e f e a t e d a 🐷 s n o w\"\n\nBreaking down \"t a 🐼🐼 d e f e a t e d\" — \"ta?? de feated\" — \"defeated\" is there. So \"t a 🐼🐼 d e f e a t e d\" could be \"ta?? defeated\". So \"ta\" followed by two letters (🐼🐼), then \"defeated\". So \"ta?? defeated\" — maybe \"tank defeated\"? But \"tank\" would be \"ta\" + \"nk\" (so 🐼=n and k? But 🐼 is the same emoji, so two same letters. Wait, \"ta\" + two same letters. Let's see \"ta\" + \"ll\" (tall), \"ta\" + \"ss\" (tass?), \"ta\" + \"nn\" (tann?), \"ta\" + \"rr\" (tarr?), \"ta\" + \"pp\" (tapp?), \"ta\" + \"bb\" (tabb?), \"ta\" + \"dd\" (tadd?), \"ta\" + \"cc\" (tacc?), \"ta\" + \"mm\" (tamm?), \"ta\" + \"gg\" (tagg?), \"ta\" + \"hh\" (tahh?), \"ta\" + \"jj\" (tajj?), \"ta\" + \"kk\" (takk?), \"ta\" + \"ll\" (tall), \"ta\" + \"qq\" (taqq?), \"ta\" + \"vv\" (tavv?), \"ta\" + \"ww\" (taww?), \"ta\" + \"xx\" (taxx?), \"ta\" + \"yy\" (tayy?), \"ta\" + \"zz\" (tazz?).\n\nLooking at the next part: \"a 🐷 s n o w\" — \"a ? snow\". So \"a [something] snow\". Maybe \"a bank snow\"? But \"a\" followed by a word. Let's see, \"a [single letter] snow\" — but \"sno\" + \"w\" is \"snow\", which we have (🐶=w, so sno🐶=snow). So \"a 🐷 snow\" — \"a [letter] snow\". So \"a b snow\"? \"a k snow\"? \"a p snow\"?\n\nNext part: \"(5: 20)\" — probably a time or score, maybe not relevant.\n\nThen: \"t a 🐼🐼 f o r c e d s n o w\" — \"ta?? forced snow\". So \"ta?? forced snow\" — same \"ta??\" as before. So same two letters for 🐼. So \"ta??\" must be a word. Let's think of two-letter repeated. \"tall\" (ta + ll), \"tank\" (no, that's nk), \"tarp\" (no), \"tass\" (ta + ss). \"Tall\" makes sense. \"Tall forced snow\" — maybe. Let's check the next part: \"t o s u b m i t\" — \"to submit\" (since 🐦=m, sub🐦i😍 is subm it). Then \"w i t h\" (🐶i😍h is wi th). \"t h e\" (😍he is the). Then \"t a 🐼🐼 m i s s i o n\" — \"ta?? mission\". \"Tall mission\"? \"Tass mission\"? \"Tall mission\" sounds better.\n\nSo \"ta?? mission\" — \"tall mission\" (ta + ll). So if 🐼=l, then \"ta🐼🐼\" would be \"tall\". Let's check the first history. In attempt 1, they guessed 🐼=l, but feedback was False. Oh right, history 1: Guess had 🐼=l, feedback said 🐼: False. So that's not it.\n\nAttempt 2: 🐼=s. Feedback was False. Attempt 3: 🐼=n. Feedback was False. So 🐼 is not l, s, n.\n\nSo let's look again. Let's look at \"ta🐼🐼\" in the sentence. The first part: \"ta🐼🐼 defeated a 🐷 snow\". Let's consider \"ta🐼🐼\" as a noun. Maybe \"tank\" (ta + nk) but 🐼 would have to be n and k, but it's the same emoji. So same letters. So \"ta\" + two same letters. Let's think of \"tart\" (ta + rt, no), \"tact\" (ta + ct, no). Maybe \"trap\" (no), \"task\" (ta + sk, no). \"Taffy\" (ta + ff), but two letters. \"taff\" (ta + ff). \"taff\" could be a name, but not common. \"Taffeta\" is longer. Maybe \"tall\" (ta + ll), but that was guessed as l (attempt 1, feedback was False). So 🐼≠l.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's check the \"a 🐷 sno🐶\" part. We know 🐶=w, so \"sno🐶=snow\". So \"a 🐷 snow\" — \"a [something] snow\". \"a bank snow\" (bank would be 🐷=b, but in attempt 2, 🐷=b, feedback was False). Attempt 1: 🐷=n, feedback False. Attempt 3: 🐷=x, feedback False. So 🐷 is not n, b, x.\n\nAnother part: \"sub🐦i😍\" — 🐦=m, 😍=t. So \"subm it\" — \"submit\". That's correct. So that part is okay.\n\n\"🐶i😍h\" — 🐶=w, 😍=t. So \"with\". Correct.\n\n\"😍he\" — 😍=t, so \"the\". Correct.\n\n\"t a 🐼🐼🐦ission\" — 🐦=m. So \"ta🐼🐼mission\". \"ta??mission\". If 🐦=m, then \"ta🐼🐼m ission\" — \"ta??m ission\". Wait, \"ta🐼🐼🐦ission\" — \"ta\" + 🐼🐼 + \"m\" + \"ission\". So \"ta??m ission\". \"ta??mission\". \"tallmission\"? No. \"tampa mission\"? \"tampa\" would be \"ta\" + \"mp\" + \"a\" (but not here). \"tamar mission\"? \"ta\" + \"ma\" + \"r\"? No. Maybe \"tarmac mission\"? \"tarmac\" is \"tar mac\", but \"ta\" + \"rm\" + \"ac\". Not sure.\n\nLet's check \"f o r c e d\" — \"forced\". That's from 😈orce🐸: 😈=f, 🐸=d. So \"force d\" → \"forced\". Correct.\n\nSo \"ta🐼🐼 forced snow\" — \"ta?? forced snow\". Let's think of \"task forced snow\" (ta + sk, but 🐼 would need to be s and k, same emoji. So no). \"tank forced snow\" (ta + nk, same issue). \"tarp forced snow\" (ta + rp). No.\n\nAlternative: The first part: \"ta🐼🐼 defeated a 🐷 snow\". \"defeated a [something] snow\". \"defeated a bank snow\" (bank would be 🐷=b, but attempt 2 had 🐷=b, feedback False). \"defeated a tank snow\" (tank would be 🐼=n and k, but 🐼 is same emoji). \"defeated a team snow\"? No. \"defeated a ...\" Maybe \"defeated a band snow\" (band, 🐷=b, but 🐷=b was tried and False).\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the first word \"ta🐼🐼\". Let's think of 4-letter words starting with \"ta\". Let's list them:\n\ntabb, tabu, taco, taff, tagg, tail, tall, tamb, tamp, tang, tank, tarp, tart, task, tast, tass, tate, tatt, tawk, taws, tawd, tawk, taxx, tayl, tazo, etc.\n\nFrom the history, previous guesses for 🐼 were l (False), s (False), n (False). So \"tall\" (🐼=l) is out. \"tass\" (🐼=s) is out. \"tann\" (🐼=n) is out. So remaining possibilities. Let's think of \"tact\" (but that's 4 letters, \"tact\" is t a c t, but the emoji is two 🐼, so \"ta\" + \"cc\" (tacc), but \"tacc\" isn't a word. \"taco\" (ta + co, but two emojis, so \"ta\" + \"co\" would need two different emojis. So not possible. \"tart\" (ta + rt, same issue). \"task\" (ta + sk, same). \"tamp\" (ta + mp). \"tank\" (ta + nk). \"tact\" (ta + ct). \"tadp\" (no). \"taff\" (ta + ff). \"taff\" could be a valid word (short for taffy maybe). So \"taff defeated a ...\" Maybe. So if 🐼=f, then \"taff\" (ta + ff). Let's check if that's possible.\n\nBut \"taff\" is a possible name or short form. Let's check the feedback. Previous attempts didn't guess 🐼=f, so that's possible.\n\nAnother part: \"ta🐼🐼 mission\" — \"taff mission\" (if 🐼=f). \"taff mission\" sounds plausible.\n\nNow, the \"a 🐷 snow\" part. \"a [something] snow\". If \"taff defeated a [something] snow\", maybe \"a pack snow\"? \"a back snow\"? \"a rack snow\"? \"a lack snow\"? Let's think of \"a pack snow\" (pack would be 🐷=p). But we don't know 🐷 yet. Previous guesses for 🐷: n (False), b (False), x (False). So possible letters left: a, c, d, e, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, y, z.\n\nWait, let's check the first part again: \"ta🐼🐼 d e f e a t e d a 🐷 s n o w\" — \"ta?? defeated a ? snow\". \"defeated a ? snow\" — \"defeated a band snow\" (band, 🐷=b, but 🐷=b was False). \"defeated a land snow\" (land, 🐷=l). If 🐷=l, then \"a land snow\". Let's check if that makes sense. \"ta?? defeated a land snow\". \"taff defeated a land snow\" — maybe.\n\nAlternatively, \"ta?? defeated a plan snow\" (plan, but \"a plan snow\" doesn't make sense). \"ta?? defeated a bank snow\" (bank, 🐷=b, which was tried and False). \"ta?? defeated a rank snow\" (rank, 🐷=r).\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at \"sno🐶\" which is \"snow\" (🐶=w). So that's correct. \"sno🐶\" is \"snow\".\n\nLet's check the \"t o s u b m i t\" part: \"to submit\" (sub🐦i😍 = subm it). Correct.\n\n\"w i t h\" (🐶i😍h = with). Correct.\n\n\"t h e\" (😍he = the). Correct.\n\nSo the sentence structure is making sense with the known emojis. The unknowns are 🐼 and 🐷.\n\nLet's focus on 🐼. The word \"ta🐼🐼\" is 4 letters (t a 🐼 🐼). Let's think of 4-letter words starting with \"ta\" and having the same third and fourth letters. So \"ta\" + \"XX\", where XX are the same letters.\n\nPossible options (excluding l, s, n):\n\n- t a a a → \"taaa\" (not a word)\n- t a b b → \"tabb\" (possible)\n- t a c c → \"tacc\" (maybe a name)\n- t a d d → \"tadd\" (possible)\n- t a e e → \"taee\" (no)\n- t a f f → \"taff\" (yes, a short form of taffy)\n- t a g g → \"tagg\" (possible)\n- t a h h → \"tahh\" (no)\n- t a i i → \"taii\" (no)\n- t a j j → \"tajj\" (no)\n- t a k k → \"takk\" (no)\n- t a l l → \"tall\" (already tried, feedback False)\n- t a m m → \"tamm\" (possible)\n- t a n n → \"tann\" (tried, feedback False)\n- t a o o → \"taoo\" (no)\n- t a p p → \"tapp\" (possible)\n- t a q q → \"taqq\" (no)\n- t a r r → \"tarr\" (possible)\n- t a s s → \"tass\" (tried, feedback False)\n- t a t t → \"tatt\" (possible)\n- t a u u → \"tauu\" (no)\n- t a v v → \"tavv\" (no)\n- t a w w → \"taww\" (no)\n- t a x x → \"taxx\" (no)\n- t a y y → \"tayy\" (no)\n- t a z z → \"tazz\" (possible)\n\nNow, let's check the \"ta🐼🐼 mission\" part. If \"taff mission\" (🐼=f), that could work. Let's see if \"taff mission\" makes sense. Alternatively, \"tapp mission\", \"tagg mission\", etc.\n\nAnother clue: The \"ta🐼🐼\" appears multiple times. Let's count:\n\nFirst occurrence: \"😍a🐼🐼\" → \"ta🐼🐼\" (first word)\nSecond occurrence: \"😍a🐼🐼\" → \"ta🐼🐼\" (after the (5:20))\nThird occurrence: \"😍a🐼🐼🐦ission\" → \"ta🐼🐼m ission\" (last part)\n\nSo \"ta🐼🐼\" is repeated, likely a key term. Maybe a name or a specific term.\n\nLet's think of \"tank\" but that's \"ta\" + \"nk\" (different letters). \"task\" (ta + sk). \"tact\" (ta + ct). None of these have the same letters. So the only option is \"ta\" + \"XX\" (same letters). So \"taff\" (ff), \"tapp\" (pp), \"tagg\" (gg), \"tarr\" (rr), \"tabb\" (bb), \"tacc\" (cc), \"tadd\" (dd), \"tamm\" (mm), \"tatt\" (tt), \"tazz\" (zz).\n\nNow, let's check the first part: \"ta🐼🐼 d e f e a t e d a 🐷 s n o w\" → \"ta?? defeated a ? snow\". If \"taff defeated a ...\", what's after \"a\"? Let's say \"a pack snow\" (pack, 🐷=p). \"taff defeated a pack snow\" — possible.\n\nAlternatively, \"taff defeated a band snow\" (band, 🐷=b, but 🐷=b was tried and feedback False). \"taff defeated a rank snow\" (rank, 🐷=r). \"taff defeated a bank snow\" (bank, 🐷=b, no). \"taff defeated a tank snow\" (tank, but \"a tank snow\" — possible.\n\nAlternatively, \"taff defeated a plan snow\" (plan, 🐷=p).\n\nNow, let's think of the 🐷 emoji. The part \"a 🐷 sno🐶\" → \"a ? snow\". Let's think of \"a bank snow\" (bank, 🐷=b) but 🐷=b was tried (attempt 2, feedback False). \"a rank snow\" (rank, 🐷=r). \"a tank snow\" (tank, 🐷=k). \"a pack snow\" (pack, 🐷=p). \"a lack snow\" (lack, 🐷=l). \"a back snow\" (back, 🐷=c).\n\nAlternatively, \"a 🐷 snow\" could be \"a man snow\" (man, 🐷=m), but \"a man snow\" — possible. \"a man snow\" would mean a man named Snow? Maybe.\n\nAlternatively, \"a 🐷 snow\" could be \"a van snow\" (van, 🐷=v). \"a van snow\" — possible.\n\nBut without more context, it's hard. Let's try to focus on 🐼 first. Let's assume that \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"tact\" (but no, same letters). \"tall\" was tried, so no. \"tass\" tried. \"tann\" tried. So perhaps \"tact\" isn't possible. Maybe \"taco\" (ta + co, but different letters). No.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look at \"d e f e a t e d\" — \"defeated\". The part before that is \"ta🐼🐼 d e f e a t e d\" — \"ta?? defeated\". So \"ta??\" is the subject. \"The ta?? defeated...\". So \"ta??\" is a noun. Let's think of \"tank\" (noun), \"task\" (noun), \"tact\" (noun). \"Tact\" is a noun meaning skill in handling situations. \"Tact defeated a ...\" — possible. But \"tact\" is t a c t, so the third letter is c and fourth is t. So 🐼 would need to be c and t, but same emoji. So not possible.\n\n\"Tank\" (t a n k) → 🐼 would be n and k. No. \"Task\" (t a s k) → 🐼 would be s and k. No. \"Tart\" (t a r t) → 🐼=r and t. No. \"Tass\" (t a s s) → 🐼=s (but attempt 2 had 🐼=s, feedback False). \"Tall\" (t a l l) → 🐼=l (attempt 1, feedback False). \"Tann\" (t a n n) → 🐼=n (attempt 3, feedback False). \"Taff\" (t a f f) → 🐼=f. Let's check if that's possible. \"Taff\" could be a name. \"Taff defeated a ...\".\n\nIf 🐼=f, then \"taff\" would be the word. Let's check the feedback. Previous attempts didn't guess 🐼=f, so that's a new guess.\n\nNow, the 🐷 emoji. Let's look at \"a 🐷 sno🐶\" → \"a ? snow\". If \"a bank snow\" (bank, 🐷=b) but 🐷=b was tried (feedback False). \"a rank snow\" (rank, 🐷=r). \"a pack snow\" (pack, 🐷=p). \"a lack snow\" (lack, 🐷=l). \"a back snow\" (back, 🐷=c). \"a van snow\" (van, 🐷=v). \"a man snow\" (man, 🐷=m). \"a can snow\" (can, 🐷=c). \"a fan snow\" (fan, 🐷=f). \"a pan snow\" (pan, 🐷=p).\n\nLet's think of \"a fan snow\" (fan, 🐷=f). \"taff defeated a fan snow\" — possible. \"taff\" and \"fan\" as names. Alternatively, \"taff defeated a man snow\" (man, 🐷=m). But \"man\" is a common word.\n\nAlternatively, \"a 🐷 snow\" could be \"a band snow\" (band, 🐷=b), but 🐷=b was tried. \"a hand snow\" (hand, 🐷=h). \"taff defeated a hand snow\" — possible.\n\nBut let's think of another part. The sentence has \"sno🐶\" which is \"snow\" (correct). The part \"sno🐶\" is \"snow\" in two places: \"a🐷 sno🐶\" and \"😈orce🐸 sno🐶\". So \"forced snow\" (from \"force d snow\" → \"forced snow\"). So \"ta?? forced snow\" — \"taff forced snow\" — possible.\n\nAnother part: \"t o s u b m i t\" → \"to submit\". \"w i t h\" → \"with\". \"t h e\" → \"the\". \"ta?? mission\" → \"taff mission\". So \"the taff mission\" — that makes sense.\n\nPutting it all together, if 🐼=f and 🐷=h, let's test:\n\nEncoded sentence with 😍=t, 😈=f, 🐸=d, 🐶=w, 🐦=m, 🐼=f, 🐷=h.\n\nThen:\n\n😍a🐼🐼 → t a f f → \"taff\"\n🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 → d e f e a t e d → \"defeated\"\na🐷 sno🐶 → a h s n o w → \"a h snow\" → \"a h snow\" (maybe \"a hash snow\"? Not sure. \"a h snow\" could be a name, like \"a H. Snow\").\n\n(5: 20) → unchanged.\n😍a🐼🐼 → \"taff\"\n😈orce🐸 → f o r c e d → \"forced\"\nsno🐶 → \"snow\"\n😍o → t o → \"to\"\nsub🐦i😍 → s u b m i t → \"submit\"\n🐶i😍h → w i t h → \"with\"\n😍he → t h e → \"the\"\n😍a🐼🐼🐦ission → t a f f m i s s i o n → \"taff mission\".\n\nSo the sentence becomes: \"taff defeated a h snow (5: 20) taff forced snow to submit with the taff mission.\"\n\nThat makes some sense. \"taff\" is a name, \"a h snow\" could be a person's name (like A.H. Snow), and the mission is the taff mission. It's a bit awkward, but possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 🐷=k. Let's try 🐷=k. \"a k snow\" → \"a K. Snow\". That could also be a name. But without more info, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, 🐼 could be 'c'. Let's check \"taff\" vs \"tacc\". \"tacc\" isn't a common word. \"tadd\" — \"ta d d\" → \"tadd\". Maybe a name. \"tadd defeated a ...\".\n\nAlternatively, let's think of \"ta🐼🐼\" as \"tact\" (but that's t a c t, which would require two different emojis for c and t, but here it's two 🐼, so same letter. So no.\n\nAnother possibility: \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"team\" (t a e m), but that's four different letters. No. \"tale\" (t a l e) — different letters. No.\n\nGiven that previous guesses for 🐼 were l, s, n (all False), and the current attempt is 4 of 10, I need to guess a new value for 🐼 and 🐷.\n\nLet's try 🐼=f (since \"taff\" seems plausible) and 🐷=k (since \"a k snow\" could be a name). Let's check if that works.\n\nSo the guess would be: 😍=t,🐼=f,🐸=d,😈=f,🐷=k,🐶=w,🐦=m. Wait, no, 😈=f is already confirmed. So the answer must include all confirmed emojis plus the new guesses.\n\nConfirmed emojis: 😍=t, 😈=f, 🐸=d, 🐶=w, 🐦=m. So those must be included. The unknowns are 🐼 and 🐷. So the guess should be: 😍=t,🐼=f,🐸=d,😈=f,🐷=k,🐶=w,🐦=m.\n\nWait, but in the history, the previous guesses for 🐼 were l, s, n (all False). So 🐼=f is a new guess. For 🐷, previous guesses were n, b, x (all False). So 🐷=k is a new guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 🐷=g. Let's say \"a g snow\" → \"a G. Snow\".\n\nBut without more info, I'll go with 🐼=f and 🐷=k as a guess.\n\nTo solve this, we start by analyzing the confirmed emojis from the history and hint:  \n- 😍=t (given hint, confirmed in all attempts).  \n- 😈=f (confirmed in all attempts).  \n- 🐸=d (confirmed in attempts 2 and 3).  \n- 🐶=w (confirmed in all attempts).  \n- 🐦=m (confirmed in all attempts).  \n\nSubstituting these into the encoded sentence, we get:  \n`ta🐼🐼 defeated a 🐷 snow (5: 20) ta🐼🐼 forced snow to submit with the ta🐼🐼mission.`  \n\n### Key Observations:  \n1. **ta🐼🐼**: This 4-letter word appears three times. It starts with \"ta\" and ends with two identical letters (since 🐼 is a single emoji). Previous guesses for 🐼 (l, s, n) were incorrect, so we need a new value. \"taff\" (ta + ff) is a plausible candidate (e.g., a name or short form).  \n2. **a 🐷 snow**: This phrase follows \"defeated.\" Previous guesses for 🐷 (n, b, x) were incorrect. \"a k snow\" (e.g., a person’s name like \"A.K. Snow\") is a reasonable guess.  \n\n### Final Guess:  \nIncluding all confirmed emojis and new guesses for 🐼 and 🐷:  \n\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐼=f,🐸=d,😈=f,🐷=k,🐶=w,🐦=m","Okay, let's try to figure out the correct emojis for this crypto word game. First, let's recap what we know so far. The encoded sentence is: 😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission.\n\nWe know that 😍=t from the hint, and the history gives us feedback on previous guesses. Let's list out the correct ones first. From the feedback:\n\n- 😍=t is correct (confirmed in all attempts).\n- 😈=f is correct (feedback True in all attempts).\n- 🐶=w is correct (feedback True in all attempts).\n- 🐦=m is correct (feedback True in all attempts).\n- 🐸=d is correct (from attempt 2, feedback was True for 🐸=d, and attempts 3 and 4 also have 🐸=d with True, so 🐸 must be d).\n\nNow, let's look at the incorrect ones. The 🐼 was guessed as l, s, n, f in attempts 1-4, all False. So we need to find another letter for 🐼.\n\nLet's start substituting the known emojis into the encoded sentence to see the words.\n\nFirst part: 😍a🐼🐼 = t a 🐼🐼. Let's see. The next word is 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸. Since 🐸=d, 😈=f, 😍=t, this becomes d e f e a t e d. \"defeated\"! That makes sense. So the second word is \"defeated\". Let's check: d e f e a t e d. Yep, that's 8 letters. The encoded part is 🐸(d)e😈(f)ea😍(t)e🐸(d) → d e f e a t e d. Perfect, that's \"defeated\".\n\nSo the first two words would be \"ta?? defeated\". Let's check the next part: a🐷 sno🐶. 🐶=w, so sno🐶 is \"snow\". So \"a🐷 snow\". So \"a [something] snow\". Maybe \"a fresh snow\"? But let's see.\n\nNext part: (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 = t a 🐼🐼. Then 😈orce🐸 = f o r c e d (since 🐸=d). So \"forced\". Then \"sno🐶\" is \"snow\". So the next part is \"t a 🐼🐼 forced snow\". Then \"😍o sub🐦i😍\" = t o sub m i t (since 🐦=m, 😍=t). \"submit\". Then \"🐶i😍h\" = w i t h (since 🐶=w, 😍=t). \"with\". Then \"😍he\" = t h e (😍=t). \"the\". Then \"😍a🐼🐼🐦ission\" = t a 🐼🐼 m i s s i o n (since 🐦=m, 😍=t). So \"ta??mission\".\n\nPutting it all together, let's substitute all knowns:\n\nEncoded: 😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission.\n\nSubstituted: t a 🐼🐼 d e f e a t e d a 🐷 s n o w (5: 20) t a 🐼🐼 f o r c e d s n o w t o s u b m i t w i t h t h e t a 🐼🐼 m i s s i o n.\n\nLooking for the first word: \"ta??\". Let's think of possible 4-letter words starting with \"ta\". Let's see the context. The sentence seems to be about a mission, maybe a military one. \"ta?? defeated a [something] snow... ta?? forced snow... the ta??mission.\" The last part is \"ta??mission\" which would be \"taXYmision\" → \"taxi mission\"? No. \"tact mission\"? \"tactical mission\" is longer, but \"tact mission\" maybe. Let's check \"tact\".\n\nIf 🐼 is 'c', then \"ta🐼🐼\" would be \"tacc\" which is not right. If 🐼 is 'c' and another 't'? No, each emoji is unique. Wait, the first word is \"t a 🐼🐼\" which is 4 letters: t-a-🐼-🐼. So the structure is t a [emoji][emoji]. Let's think of 4-letter words starting with 'ta' where the last two letters are the same? Like \"tall\" (ta + ll), \"tass\" (ta + ss), \"trap\" (no, but not same letters), \"tart\" (tart), but in the history, 🐼 was guessed as l (attempt 1, feedback False), s (attempt 2, False), n (attempt 3, False), f (attempt 4, False). So \"tall\" would mean 🐼=l, which was wrong. \"tass\" would be 🐼=s, which was wrong. \"tann\" (🐼=n, attempt 3, wrong). \"taff\" (🐼=f, attempt 4, wrong). So maybe the last two letters are different. So \"t a 🐼🐼\" is 4 letters: t a [x][y], where x and y are the same emoji (so same letter). So the two 🐼s are the same letter, so the word is t a [letter][letter]. Let's see the later part: \"ta??mission\" would be \"ta[letter][letter]mission\". So \"ta[xx]mission\" → \"taximission\" (no), \"tactmission\" (tact mission?), \"talisman mission\" (no). Alternatively, \"tactical mission\" but that's longer.\n\nWait, let's look at \"defeated a 🐷 snow\". The word \"a 🐷 snow\" → \"a [single letter] snow\". So \"a [something] snow\". Possible options: \"a fresh snow\", \"a light snow\", \"a soft snow\", etc. The 🐷 is a single letter (since it's a🐷: a + 🐷). So \"a [letter] snow\". Let's see, \"a fresh snow\" would need 🐷=f, but 😈=f already (so 🐷 can't be f). \"a soft snow\" → 🐷=o? \"a cold snow\" → 🐷=c? \"a new snow\" → 🐷=n (but in attempt 1, 🐷=n was wrong). \"a big snow\" → 🐷=b (attempt 2, 🐷=b was wrong). \"a dry snow\" → 🐷=r? \"a wet snow\" → 🐷=w (but 🐶=w). \"a red snow\" → 🐷=r. Let's keep that in mind.\n\nLooking at \"ta?? forced snow\". Forced snow might be part of a mission. Let's go back to the first word. Let's look at \"ta?? defeated\". \"They defeated\" would be \"they\", but \"ta??\" is 4 letters. \"They\" is 4 letters. Oh! \"they\" → t-h-e-y. Wait, \"😍a🐼🐼\" → t a 🐼🐼. \"they\" is t-h-e-y. So the structure is t a h e y? No, \"ta\" is the first two letters. \"they\" is t-h-e-y, which is 4 letters. So \"t a h e\" → no. Wait, perhaps \"task\"? \"task\" is t-a-s-k. But 🐼 was guessed as s (attempt 2, feedback False). So no. \"tank\" → t-a-n-k. 🐼 was n in attempt 3 (feedback False). \"tart\" → t-a-r-t. So if 🐼=r, then \"t a r t\". \"tart defeated...\" Maybe. Let's check.\n\nIf 🐼=r, then \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"tart\". Let's see the later part: \"ta🐼🐼mission\" would be \"tartmission\". That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, \"team\"? \"team\" is t-e-a-m. But \"t a 🐼🐼\" → t a [emoji][emoji]. \"team\" would be t-e-a-m, which would be t (😍) e (not part of the emoji here) a (given) m (but 🐦=m). So not matching.\n\nWait, let's look at \"the ta??mission\". If \"ta??mission\" is \"tactmission\" (tact mission), then \"ta??\" would be \"tact\" (t-a-c-t). So the two 🐼s would be 'c' and 't'? No, because the emoji 🐼 is the same, so both letters must be the same. So \"tact\" is t-a-c-t → so the third and fourth letters are c and t. But since the emoji is 🐼, which is the same, that would require the third and fourth letters to be the same. So \"tact\" has c and t, different. So that's not possible. \"tall\" → t-a-l-l. 🐼=l. But attempt 1 had 🐼=l, feedback False. So that's out. \"tass\" → t-a-s-s. 🐼=s (attempt 2, feedback False). \"tann\" → t-a-n-n. 🐼=n (attempt 3, feedback False). \"taff\" → t-a-f-f. 🐼=f (attempt 4, feedback False). All these have been tried and failed.\n\nHmm. Let's check the word \"sub🐦i😍\" → sub m i t (since 🐦=m, 😍=t). \"submit\" → that's correct. So \"t o submit\" → \"to submit\". Then \"🐶i😍h\" → w i t h → \"with\". \"😍he\" → t h e → \"the\". \"ta??mission\" → t a 🐼🐼 m i s s i o n. So \"ta??mission\" is a 10-letter word: t a [x][x] m i s s i o n. Let's count letters: t (1), a (2), x (3), x (4), m (5), i (6), s (7), s (8), i (9), o (10), n (11). Wait, that's 11 letters. \"ta??mission\" → \"ta\" + two letters (🐼🐼) + \"mission\". So \"ta\" (2) + 2 letters (🐼🐼) + \"mission\" (7 letters) → 2+2+7=11 letters. Let's check: \"tactical mission\" is longer. Maybe \"target mission\"? \"target\" is 6 letters, but \"ta??\" is 4 letters. \"targa mission\"? No.\n\nAlternatively, let's check the first part again: \"t a 🐼🐼 d e f e a t e d a 🐷 s n o w\". So \"t a [xx] defeated a [y] snow\". Let's think of \"t a [xx]\" as \"they\" → t-h-e-y. But \"they\" is 4 letters: t-h-e-y. So \"t a h e\" → no. \"they\" would need \"t h e y\", but the structure here is \"t a 🐼🐼\". So \"t a\" is the first two letters. So the word is \"ta\" followed by two of the same letter (since 🐼 is the same emoji). Let's think of \"tale\" → t-a-l-e. No, different letters. \"tarp\" → t-a-r-p. \"tart\" → t-a-r-t. \"tare\" → t-a-r-e. \"taps\" → t-a-p-s. \"tans\" → t-a-n-s. None of these have the same third and fourth letters except \"tall\", \"tass\", \"tann\", \"taff\" which we already saw.\n\nWait, maybe the first word is \"task\". \"task\" is t-a-s-k. But then 🐼 would be s and k? No, the emoji is the same. So \"task\" is 4 letters: t-a-s-k. So 🐼 would need to be s and k, but that's two different emojis, but here it's the same 🐼. So that's not possible.\n\nLet's try to look at another part. The encoded sentence has \"(5: 20)\". That's probably a time, like 5:20. Then \"t a 🐼🐼 forced snow\". \"Forced snow\" could be part of a weather condition. \"t a 🐼🐼\" could be \"tact\" (tactical?), but \"tact forced snow\" doesn't make sense. \"tank forced snow\" → maybe a tank in snow. \"tart forced snow\" → no. \"tall forced snow\" → a tall structure?\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"ta??\" is \"part\". \"part\" is p-a-r-t. But the first letter is t (😍=t), so \"part\" starts with p, which doesn't fit. \"test\" → t-e-s-t. So \"t a s t\" → \"tast\"? No. \"test\" would be t-e-s-t. The structure here is t-a-🐼-🐼. So \"test\" would need \"t e s t\", which doesn't fit \"t a\".\n\nWait, let's check the word \"defeated\" again. We have \"d e f e a t e d\" (from 🐸=d, 😈=f, 😍=t). That's correct. So the first part is \"[word] defeated a [something] snow\". Let's think of possible 4-letter words starting with \"ta\" that could fit here. \"tank\", \"task\", \"tale\", \"tart\", \"tass\", \"tall\", \"tans\", \"taps\", \"taro\", \"tarp\", \"tare\", \"tase\", \"tatt\" (as in tattoo, but \"tatt\" is a slang). \"tatt\" → t-a-t-t. So if 🐼 is t, then \"t a t t\" → \"tatt\". But in the history, 🐼 was guessed as l, s, n, f. So t hasn't been guessed yet. Let's check if that's possible. If 🐼=t, then \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"tatt\". Then \"tatt defeated a [y] snow\". \"tatt\" doesn't make much sense, but maybe. Let's check other parts. \"ta🐼🐼mission\" would be \"tattmission\" → \"tatt mission\"? Not great.\n\nAlternatively, \"taut\" → t-a-u-t. So 🐼=u. \"taut\" could make sense: \"taut defeated a...\" Maybe. \"taut\" means tight. \"taut forced snow\" → maybe the snow is packed tight. \"taut mission\" → a tight mission. That could work. Let's see if 🐼=u is possible. The previous guesses for 🐼 were l, s, n, f. None were u, so that's a possibility.\n\nAnother angle: the word \"sub🐦i😍\" is \"submit\" (sub + m + i + t), which is correct (since 🐦=m, 😍=t). Then \"🐶i😍h\" is \"with\" (w + i + t + h). Correct. \"😍he\" is \"the\" (t + h + e). Correct. So \"the ta??mission\" → \"the [ta??] mission\". So \"ta??\" is an adjective maybe. \"tactical mission\" → but \"tactical\" is 8 letters, and \"ta??\" is 4 letters, so that's not. \"tough mission\" → \"tough\" starts with t, but \"ta??\" is t-a-??. \"task mission\" → \"task\" is 4 letters. \"task mission\" → possible. \"task\" would be t-a-s-k. So if 🐼=s and k? No, the emoji is the same. So \"task\" is t-a-s-k, which would need two different emojis for s and k, but here it's the same 🐼. So that's not possible.\n\nLet's check the word \"a🐷\". The structure is \"a\" followed by 🐷. So \"a [letter]\". The next word is \"snow\". So \"a [letter] snow\". Let's think of \"a fresh snow\" → \"fresh\" is 5 letters, but here it's \"a [single letter] snow\". So \"a [letter] snow\" → \"a soft snow\" (o), \"a cold snow\" (c), \"a new snow\" (n), \"a dry snow\" (r), \"a wet snow\" (w), \"a red snow\" (r), \"a big snow\" (b), \"a bad snow\" (d), \"a hot snow\" (h) (unlikely), \"a mad snow\" (m) (but 🐦=m). Let's look at previous attempts. In attempt 1, 🐷=n (feedback False). Attempt 2: 🐷=b (False). Attempt 3: 🐷=x (False). Attempt 4: 🐷=k (False). So possible letters for 🐷 could be c, d, h, o, r, s, t, u, v, etc. Let's think of \"a cold snow\" → 🐷=c. \"a cold snow\" makes sense. So if 🐷=c, then \"a cold snow\". Let's check if that fits.\n\nIf 🐷=c, then \"a🐷\" is \"ac\" → \"a c\" → \"a cold\". So \"a cold snow\". That works. Let's keep that in mind.\n\nGoing back to the first word: \"t a 🐼🐼\". Let's think of \"tact\" → t-a-c-t. So if 🐼=c, then \"t a c c\" → \"tacc\"? No, \"tact\" is t-a-c-t. So third letter c, fourth letter t. But the emoji is the same 🐼, so third and fourth letters would be the same. So \"tact\" can't be. \"taco\" → t-a-c-o. No, same issue. \"tact\" is 4 letters, but with different letters.\n\nAlternatively, \"tale\" → t-a-l-e. If 🐼=l, but attempt 1 had 🐼=l (feedback False). So no. \"take\" → t-a-k-e. \"tame\" → t-a-m-e (but 🐦=m). \"tape\" → t-a-p-e. \"tarp\" → t-a-r-p. \"tart\" → t-a-r-t. \"tase\" → t-a-s-e. \"tass\" → t-a-s-s (🐼=s, attempt 2 feedback False). \"tatt\" → t-a-t-t. \"taut\" → t-a-u-t. \"tawdry\" is longer. \n\nLet's think of \"taut\" again. If 🐼=u, then \"taut\" (t-a-u-t). \"taut defeated a cold snow\". \"taut\" (meaning tight) could work. \"taut forced snow\" → the snow is packed tight. \"taut mission\" → a tight mission. That's possible.\n\nAlternatively, \"tusk\" → t-u-s-k. No, structure is t-a-🐼-🐼. \"tusk\" starts with t-u, not t-a.\n\nLet's check the \"ta??mission\" again. If \"ta??\" is \"tact\", then \"tactmission\" → \"tact mission\". But \"tact\" is 4 letters, so \"ta??\" would be \"tact\", which would need 🐼=c and t (but same emoji). So no. \"tactical mission\" is 14 letters, which is longer than \"ta??mission\" (11 letters).\n\nAlternatively, \"target mission\" → \"target\" is 6 letters, so \"ta??\" would be \"ta\" plus two letters, but \"target\" is t-a-r-g-e-t. So \"ta??\" would be \"ta\" + r + g → \"targ\". So \"targ mission\". That's possible. \"targ\" isn't a real word, but maybe a code name. If 🐼=r and g, but again, same emoji. So no.\n\nLet's try to think of the letters that 🐼 could be. The previous guesses were l, s, n, f. So possible letters not tried yet: c, t, u, o, p, r, etc. Let's try 🐼=c. Then \"ta??\" is \"tacc\". Not a word. 🐼=t → \"tatt\". Maybe. 🐼=u → \"taut\". \"taut\" is a valid word. Let's check if \"taut\" makes sense in the sentence.\n\n\"taut defeated a cold snow (5:20) taut forced snow to submit with the taut mission.\" That could make sense. A taut (tight) situation, defeated a cold snow, forced snow, submit with the taut mission. It's a bit odd, but possible.\n\nAnother angle: let's look at the word \"sno🐶\" which is \"snow\" (since 🐶=w). That's correct. \"sno🐶\" → s-n-o-w. Correct. \"😈orce🐸\" → f-o-r-c-e-d (since 😈=f, 🐸=d). \"forced\" → correct. So \"forced snow\" makes sense.\n\n\"😍o sub🐦i😍\" → t-o sub-m-i-t → \"to submit\". Correct. \"🐶i😍h\" → w-i-t-h → \"with\". Correct. \"😍he\" → t-h-e → \"the\". Correct. \"😍a🐼🐼🐦ission\" → t-a-🐼🐼-m-i-s-s-i-o-n. So \"ta??mission\" → if 🐼=u, then \"taut mission\" → \"taut mission\". That's possible.\n\nSo putting it all together, the remaining unknowns are 🐼 and 🐷. Let's summarize the knowns:\n\n😍=t (correct)\n😈=f (correct)\n🐸=d (correct)\n🐶=w (correct)\n🐦=m (correct)\n🐼=? (previous guesses l, s, n, f all wrong)\n🐷=? (previous guesses n, b, x, k all wrong)\n\nLet's try to find 🐼 first. Let's assume the first word is \"taut\" (t-a-u-t), so 🐼=u. Then \"taut defeated a [something] snow\". Let's check the 🐷. If \"a 🐷 snow\" is \"a cold snow\", then 🐷=c. Let's test that.\n\nSo possible guess: 🐼=u, 🐷=c.\n\nLet's check if that fits all parts:\n\nEncoded Sentence with substitutions:\n\n😍a🐼🐼 → t a u u → \"ta uu\"? Wait, no. If 🐼=u, then \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"ta uu\" → \"ta uu\"? That's not \"taut\". Oh, wait! \"taut\" is t-a-u-t. So the structure would be t (😍) a (given) u (🐼) t (another letter). But the emoji 🐼 is used twice, so both letters would be u. So \"ta🐼🐼\" would be \"ta uu\" → \"ta uu\", which is not \"taut\". Oh, right! The two 🐼s are the same emoji, so they must represent the same letter. So \"ta🐼🐼\" is t-a-[x]-[x], where x is the same letter. So \"taut\" would require x to be u and t, but that's two different letters, which isn't possible. So my mistake earlier.\n\nSo \"taut\" is t-a-u-t. The third letter is u, fourth is t. So two different letters, but the emoji 🐼 is the same, so they have to be the same letter. So \"taut\" is not possible. So back to the drawing board.\n\nLet's think of 4-letter words starting with \"ta\" where the third and fourth letters are the same. Let's list them:\n\n- \"tall\" (t-a-l-l) → l (attempt 1: 🐼=l → feedback False)\n- \"tass\" (t-a-s-s) → s (attempt 2: 🐼=s → feedback False)\n- \"tann\" (t-a-n-n) → n (attempt 3: 🐼=n → feedback False)\n- \"taff\" (t-a-f-f) → f (attempt 4: 🐼=f → feedback False)\n- \"tatt\" (t-a-t-t) → t (not guessed yet)\n- \"tabb\" (t-a-b-b) → b (attempt 2: 🐷=b → feedback False, but 🐼 and 🐷 are different emojis, so possible)\n- \"tadd\" (t-a-d-d) → d (🐸=d, so can't be, since emojis are unique)\n- \"tagg\" (t-a-g-g) → g (not guessed)\n- \"tarr\" (t-a-r-r) → r (not guessed)\n- \"taoo\" (t-a-o-o) → o (not guessed)\n- \"taee\" (t-a-e-e) → e (🐸 was guessed as e in attempt 1, feedback False)\n- \"taqq\" (unlikely)\n- \"tazz\" (t-a-z-z) → z (unlikely)\n\nSo possible candidates for 🐼 are t, b, g, r, o, z. Let's check \"tatt\" (t-a-t-t). \"tatt\" is a slang term for tattoo. \"tatt defeated a...\". Maybe. \"tatt forced snow...\" Not great, but possible. \"tatt mission\" → \"tatt mission\". Maybe.\n\nIf 🐼=t, then \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"tatt\". Let's check the \"ta🐼🐼🐦ission\" → \"tatt mission\" (t-a-t-t-m-i-s-s-i-o-n). That's \"tatt mission\". Could work.\n\nNow, the 🐷. Let's think again. \"a🐷 snow\" → \"a [letter] snow\". Possible options: \"a cold snow\" (c), \"a soft snow\" (o), \"a hard snow\" (h), \"a dry snow\" (r), \"a wet snow\" (w), \"a big snow\" (b), \"a new snow\" (n), \"a red snow\" (r), \"a bad snow\" (d), \"a mad snow\" (m), \"a sad snow\" (s), \"a fad snow\" (f), \"a lad snow\" (l), \"a dad snow\" (d). \n\nFrom previous attempts, 🐷 was guessed as n (attempt 1, False), b (attempt 2, False), x (attempt 3, False), k (attempt 4, False). So possible letters: c, d, h, o, r, s, t, u, v, etc. Let's assume \"a cold snow\" → 🐷=c. Let's try that.\n\nSo possible guess: 🐼=t, 🐷=c.\n\nLet's check all substitutions:\n\n😍=t, 😈=f, 🐸=d, 🐶=w, 🐦=m, 🐼=t, 🐷=c.\n\nNow, let's substitute into the encoded sentence:\n\nEncoded: 😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission.\n\nSubstituted: t a t t d e f e a t e d a c s n o w (5: 20) t a t t f o r c e d s n o w t o s u b m i t w i t h t h e t a t t m i s s i o n.\n\nNow, let's parse the sentence:\n\n\"tatt defeated a c snow (5:20) tatt forced snow to submit with the tatt mission.\"\n\nHmm, \"tatt\" is slang for a small tattoo, which doesn't fit here. Maybe \"tact\" but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe \"task\" but that's t-a-s-k, which would need 🐼=s and k, but same emoji. \n\nAnother approach: let's look at the word \"ta??\" again. The sentence structure suggests it's a noun, maybe a code name or a team name. Let's think of \"tank\". \"tank\" is t-a-n-k. But 🐼 was guessed as n (attempt 3, feedback False), so no. \"task\" → t-a-s-k. 🐼=s (attempt 2, feedback False). \"tale\" → t-a-l-e. 🐼=l (attempt 1, False). \"taro\" → t-a-r-o. \"tarp\" → t-a-r-p. \"tart\" → t-a-r-t. Let's try 🐼=r. Then \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"tarr\". \"tarr\" is a surname, not a common word. \"tarr defeated a...\". Not great.\n\nAlternatively, \"taos\" → t-a-o-s. But \"taos\" is a place. \"taos defeated a...\". Maybe. But \"taos\" has o and s, which would require 🐼=o and s, but same emoji. No.\n\nLet's think of the \"ta??mission\" again. If \"ta??mission\" is \"tactical mission\", but that's 14 letters. The encoded part is \"ta??mission\" which is t-a-🐼-🐼-m-i-s-s-i-o-n → 11 letters. \"tactical mission\" is 14 letters (t-a-c-t-i-c-a-l m-i-s-s-i-o-n). So that's too long. \"tact mission\" is 10 letters (t-a-c-t m-i-s-s-i-o-n). So \"ta??mission\" would be \"tactmission\" (11 letters), which is \"tact mission\". So \"ta??\" is \"tact\". So \"tact\" is t-a-c-t. So the third letter is c, fourth is t. But the emoji 🐼 is the same, so third and fourth letters must be the same. So \"tact\" would need the third and fourth letters to be the same, which they aren't. So that's not possible.\n\nAnother angle: the word \"defeated\" is 8 letters, and the encoded part is 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 → 8 characters (🐸, e, 😈, e, a, 😍, e, 🐸). Which matches \"defeated\" (d, e, f, e, a, t, e, d). Correct. So that's solid.\n\nThe first word is 4 letters: 😍a🐼🐼 → t, a, 🐼, 🐼. Let's think of \"they\". \"they\" is t-h-e-y. So t, h, e, y. But the structure here is t, a, 🐼, 🐼. So \"they\" doesn't fit. \"them\" → t-h-e-m. No. \"than\" → t-h-a-n. No. \"that\" → t-h-a-t. No. \"this\" → t-h-i-s. No.\n\nWait, maybe the first word is \"part\". \"part\" is p-a-r-t. But starts with p, not t. No. \"past\" → p-a-s-t. No. \"post\" → p-o-s-t. No.\n\nAlternatively, \"test\". \"test\" is t-e-s-t. So t, e, s, t. Structure is t, a, 🐼, 🐼. Doesn't fit.\n\nLet's try to think of the letters that are left. The English alphabet has 26 letters. We know:\n\n😍=t, 😈=f, 🐸=d, 🐶=w, 🐦=m. So used letters: t, f, d, w, m.\n\nThe emojis are: 😍, 🐼, 🐸, 😈, 🐷, 🐶, 🐦. So 7 emojis. So 7 letters. So each emoji is a unique letter. So the letters used are 7 unique letters. So far, we know 5 letters (t, f, d, w, m). The remaining are 🐼 and 🐷, which are two more unique letters.\n\nSo possible letters for 🐼 and 🐷 are from the remaining 21 letters (excluding t, f, d, w, m).\n\nLet's think of the word \"a🐷\". It's \"a\" followed by the letter for 🐷. So \"a [letter]\". The next word is \"snow\". So \"a [letter] snow\". Let's think of \"a fresh snow\" → but 😈=f, so 🐷 can't be f. \"a soft snow\" → o. \"a cold snow\" → c. \"a hard snow\" → h. \"a dry snow\" → r. \"a wet snow\" → w (but 🐶=w). \"a big snow\" → b. \"a new snow\" → n (attempt 1: 🐷=n → feedback False). \"a red snow\" → r. \"a bad snow\" → d (🐸=d). \"a mad snow\" → m (🐦=m). \"a sad snow\" → s. \"a fad snow\" → f (😈=f). \"a lad snow\" → l. \"a dad snow\" → d (🐸=d). \"a pad snow\" → p. \"a rad snow\" → r. \"a sad snow\" → s. \"a tad snow\" → t (😍=t). \"a wad snow\" → w (🐶=w). \"a yak snow\" → k (attempt 4: 🐷=k → feedback False).\n\nSo possible letters for 🐷: c, h, o, r, p, s, l, etc. Let's try 🐷=c (cold). Then \"a cold snow\". That makes sense.\n\nNow, the first word \"ta🐼🐼\". Let's think of \"tact\" again. If 🐼=c, then \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"tacc\". Not a word. \"tack\" → t-a-c-k. So \"tack\" is 4 letters. If 🐼=c, then \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"tacc\" (t-a-c-c). \"tacc\" isn't a word, but \"tack\" is. But \"tack\" is t-a-c-k, so the fourth letter is k, which would be a different emoji. So no.\n\nAlternatively, \"taco\" → t-a-c-o. No, same issue. \"tact\" → t-a-c-t. Fourth letter t (😍=t). So \"ta🐼🐼\" would be \"tact\" → t-a-c-t. But the fourth letter is t (😍=t), which is a different emoji. So 🐼 would be c, and the fourth letter is t (😍=t). So \"ta🐼🐼\" → t-a-c-t → \"tact\". That's possible. Wait, but the emoji for the fourth letter is 🐼, but in the encoded sentence, it's 😍a🐼🐼. So the structure is 😍 (t) a (a) 🐼 (c) 🐼 (t). Oh, wait! No, the fourth character is the second 🐼. So if 🐼=c, then the fourth letter is c. So \"ta🐼🐼\" would be t-a-c-c → \"tacc\". Which isn't a word. So that's not possible.\n\nLet's try to think differently. Maybe the first word is \"task\". \"task\" is t-a-s-k. So \"ta🐼🐼\" would be t-a-s-k. But the emojis for s and k would have to be the same (🐼), which they aren't. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first word is \"team\". \"team\" is t-e-a-m. But the structure is t-a-🐼-🐼. So \"team\" would be t-e-a-m, which doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the encoded sentence has \"sno🐶\" which is \"snow\" (correct). \"sno🐶\" → s-n-o-🐶=w. Correct. \"😈orce🐸\" → f-o-r-c-e-🐸=d → \"forced\". Correct. \"sub🐦i😍\" → s-u-b-🐦=m-i-😍=t → \"submit\". Correct. \"🐶i😍h\" → 🐶=w-i-😍=t-h → \"with\". Correct. \"😍he\" → 😍=t-h-e → \"the\". Correct. \"😍a🐼🐼🐦ission\" → t-a-🐼-🐼-🐦=m-i-s-s-i-o-n → \"ta??mission\". \n\nThe only parts left are \"ta??\" and \"a🐷\". Let's assume that \"ta??\" is a name or code, like \"taro\" (t-a-r-o). If 🐼=r and o, but same emoji. No. \"tara\" → t-a-r-a. If 🐼=r and a, but a is a given letter (not an emoji). So no.\n\nAlternatively, \"ta\" could be part of a hyphenated word, but unlikely. \n\nLet's try to guess 🐼 as 'c' (even though not tried before). If 🐼=c, then \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"tacc\". Then \"tacc defeated a [y] snow\". Not great. But let's see. Maybe \"tacc\" is a code name.\n\nAlternatively, let's try 🐼=g. Then \"ta??\" is \"tag g\" → \"tagg\". \"tagg defeated a...\". Maybe.\n\nAt this point, since we have to make a guess, and the previous attempts for 🐼 were l, s, n, f (all wrong), let's try a new letter. Let's say 🐼=c (not guessed yet). And 🐷=c is taken? No, 🐷 is a different emoji. Let's try 🐼=c and 🐷=h (for \"a hard snow\").\n\nBut I'm not sure. Another approach: let's look at the frequency of emojis. The encoded sentence has:\n\n😍 appears multiple times: let's count.\n\n😍: in 😍a🐼🐼, 😍e🐸, 😍o, sub🐦i😍, 🐶i😍h, 😍he, 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission. So many times, but we know 😍=t.\n\n🐼: appears in 😍a🐼🐼 (twice), 😍a🐼🐼 (twice), 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission (twice). So 6 times.\n\n🐸: appears in 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸, 😈orce🐸. So 2 times. We know 🐸=d.\n\n😈: appears in 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸, 😈orce🐸. So 2 times. 😈=f.\n\n🐷: once in a🐷.\n\n🐶: in sno🐶, 🐶i😍h. So 2 times. 🐶=w.\n\n🐦: in sub🐦i😍, 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission. So 2 times. 🐦=m.\n\nSo 🐼 is the most frequent emoji after 😍. The hint said the most frequent emoji's letter is revealed, but in this case, the hint was 😍=t, which is the most frequent. So that's covered.\n\nGiven that, and the previous attempts, I think the best guess is to try 🐼=c (since other letters were tried) and 🐷=c (no, different emoji). Alternatively, 🐼=r and 🐷=r. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of \"ta??\" as \"task\" but that's not possible. Maybe \"tact\" even if the letters aren't the same. But no, the emoji is the same. \n\nGiven that I have to make a guess, and the previous attempts for 🐼 were l, s, n, f (all wrong), I'll try 🐼=c (not guessed) and 🐷=c (no, different emoji). Let's try 🐼=c and 🐷=h. So the guess would be 😍=t,🐼=c,🐸=d,😈=f,🐷=h,🐶=w,🐦=m.\n\n\n\nTo solve this Crypto Word Game, we analyze the encoded sentence, feedback from previous attempts, and known mappings. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Known Correct Mappings (from History):\n- 😍=t (confirmed in all attempts)\n- 😈=f (feedback: True)\n- 🐸=d (feedback: True from attempt 2 onward)\n- 🐶=w (feedback: True)\n- 🐦=m (feedback: True)\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Encoded Sentence Substitutions**: Using known mappings, parts of the sentence resolve to coherent words:\n   - 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 → d e f e a t e d → \"defeated\" (matches 8 letters).\n   - 😈orce🐸 → f o r c e d → \"forced\" (matches 6 letters).\n   - sub🐦i😍 → sub m i t → \"submit\" (matches 6 letters).\n   - 🐶i😍h → w i t h → \"with\" (matches 4 letters).\n   - 😍he → t h e → \"the\" (matches 3 letters).\n   - sno🐶 → s n o w → \"snow\" (matches 4 letters).\n\n2. **Unresolved Emojis**:\n   - 🐼: Guessed as l, s, n, f (all incorrect). Needs a new letter.\n   - 🐷: Guessed as n, b, x, k (all incorrect). Needs a new letter.\n\n### Deductions for 🐼:\nThe phrase 😍a🐼🐼 (t a 🐼🐼) appears multiple times (e.g., \"t a 🐼🐼 defeated...\" and \"t a 🐼🐼 mission\"). This suggests a 4-letter word starting with \"ta\" where the last two letters are identical (since 🐼 is the same emoji). Common 4-letter \"ta-\" words with repeating letters (not previously guessed) include \"tacc\" (unlikely), \"tagg\" (unlikely), or \"tarr\" (unlikely). Given the context of a mission, \"tact\" (t-a-c-t) is plausible, but the last two letters must be the same. Testing \"tact\" is invalid, so we try a new letter: **c** (not previously guessed).\n\n### Deductions for 🐷:\nThe phrase a🐷 sno🐶 (a 🐷 snow) suggests \"a [single letter] snow.\" Common options include \"a cold snow\" (c), \"a hard snow\" (h), or \"a soft snow\" (o). Since previous guesses for 🐷 (n, b, x, k) failed, we try **c** (cold snow).\n\n### Final Guess:\nBased on the above, the remaining emojis are mapped as follows:\n- 🐼=c (new guess, not previously tried)\n- 🐷=c (new guess, fits \"a cold snow\")\n\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐼=c,🐸=d,😈=f,🐷=c,🐶=w,🐦=m","Okay, let's try to figure out the current guess. First, let's list out what we know from the history and the hint. The hint says 😍=t, and that's confirmed correct in all attempts. \n\nLooking at the feedback from previous attempts:\n\n- 😍=t is correct (all feedbacks say True).\n- 😈=f is correct (all feedbacks say True).\n- 🐶=w is correct (all feedbacks say True).\n- 🐦=m is correct (all feedbacks say True).\n- 🐸=d is correct starting from attempt 2 onwards, since attempt 2's feedback for 🐸 was True, and subsequent attempts also have 🐸=d with True. So 🐸=d is confirmed.\n\nNow, the incorrect ones we need to figure out are 🐼 and 🐷. Let's look at the encoded sentence with the known substitutions. Let's replace the known emojis:\n\nEncoded Sentence (after substitution):\nt a 🐼🐼 d e f e a t e d a 🐷 s n o w (5: 20) t a 🐼🐼 f o r c e d s n o w t o s u b m i t w i t h t h e t a 🐼🐼 m i s s i o n.\n\nLet's parse the sentence step by step. Let's break it down into parts.\n\nFirst part: \"t a 🐼🐼 d e f e a t e d a 🐷 s n o w (5: 20)\" \n\nThen: \"t a 🐼🐼 f o r c e d s n o w t o s u b m i t w i t h t h e t a 🐼🐼 m i s s i o n.\"\n\nLet's look at \"d e f e a t e d\" – that's \"defeated\". So \"t a 🐼🐼 d e f e a t e d a 🐷 s n o w\" would be \"t a [something] defeated a [something] snow\". Let's split that: \"ta[🐼🐼] defeated a [🐷] snow\". The word \"ta[🐼🐼]\" – maybe \"task\"? If 🐼🐼 is \"sk\", then \"task\" (t a s k). Let's check. Let's see, in the first attempt, 🐼 was guessed as 'l' (False), then 's' (False), 'n' (False), 'f' (False), 'c' (False). So maybe 's' was a guess but it was wrong. Let's see.\n\nLooking at \"t a 🐼🐼\" – if that's \"task\", then 🐼🐼 is \"sk\". So each 🐼 would be 's' and 'k'? But each emoji is a unique letter. So each emoji is a single letter. So 🐼 is one letter, so \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"ta\" + two of the same emoji, so \"taXX\" where XX is two of the same letter. So \"taXX\" could be \"tall\" (ta + ll), \"tank\" (ta + nk, but same emoji), \"tass\" (ta + ss), \"trap\" (no, same emoji). Let's see the next part: \"defeated a 🐷 snow\". \"defeated a [X] snow\". \"a [X] snow\" – maybe \"a band snow\"? No. \"a tank snow\"? Not sure.\n\nAnother part: \"t a 🐼🐼 f o r c e d s n o w\" – \"taXX forced snow\". \"forced\" is \"f o r c e d\", which is correct (since 😈=f, 🐸=d, so \"f o r c e d\" matches \"😈orce🐸\"). So \"taXX forced snow\" – \"task forced snow\"? \"tall forced snow\"? \"tact forced snow\"?\n\nThen later: \"t o s u b m i t\" (to submit) which is correct because 🐦=m, so \"sub🐦i😍\" becomes \"subm i t\". That part works.\n\n\"w i t h t h e t a 🐼🐼 m i s s i o n.\" – \"with the taXX mission\". \"mission\" is correct (since 🐦=m, \"🐦ission\" is \"mission\"). So \"taXX mission\" – \"task mission\", \"tall mission\", \"tank mission\", etc.\n\nLooking at the first part: \"(5: 20)\" – maybe a time or page reference, not sure. Let's check \"sno🐶\" which is \"snow\" because 🐶=w, so \"sno\" + 🐶=w → \"snow\". That's correct.\n\nAnother part: \"a🐷\" – \"a\" + 🐷. So \"aX\". The first part has \"a🐷 sno🐶\" → \"aX snow\". Let's see. If \"defeated a X snow\" – maybe \"defeated a band snow\"? No. \"defeated a sand snow\"? Maybe \"sand\" (a sand snow). But \"a sand snow\" sounds odd. Alternatively, \"defeated a land snow\"? Hmm. Alternatively, \"defeated a rand snow\"? Not helpful.\n\nLooking back at \"taXX\" in \"taXX defeated a X snow\". Let's consider possible two-letter words where both letters are the same (since it's two 🐼 emojis). So \"ta\" + two of the same letter. Let's think of possible words:\n\n- \"tall\" (ta + ll) → 🐼=l. But in attempt 1, 🐼 was guessed as 'l' and feedback was False. So that's out.\n- \"tass\" (ta + ss) → 🐼=s. Attempt 2 guessed 🐼=s, feedback was False. So that's out.\n- \"tact\" (ta + ct) → no, same emoji, so same letter.\n- \"tank\" (ta + nk) → no, same letter.\n- \"tarp\" (ta + rp) → no.\n- \"toll\" (to + ll, but here it's \"ta\", not \"to\").\n- \"tart\" (ta + rt) → no.\n- \"twin\" (no, not \"ta\").\n- \"task\" (ta + sk) → sk, but each 🐼 is one letter. So \"task\" would be t a s k, so the two 🐼s would need to be 's' and 'k', but each emoji is a single letter, so that's not possible. So the two 🐼s must be the same letter. So \"taXX\" where XX is same letter.\n\nAnother angle: the entire sentence. Let's try to parse more. The full encoded sentence with knowns:\n\n\"t a 🐼🐼 d e f e a t e d a 🐷 s n o w (5: 20) t a 🐼🐼 f o r c e d s n o w t o s u b m i t w i t h t h e t a 🐼🐼 m i s s i o n.\"\n\nBreaking into words:\n\n1. t a 🐼🐼 → \"taXX\"\n2. d e f e a t e d → \"defeated\" (correct, since 🐸=d, 😈=f)\n3. a 🐷 → \"aX\"\n4. s n o w → \"snow\" (correct, 🐶=w)\n5. (5: 20) → maybe a timestamp or page, not helpful\n6. t a 🐼🐼 → \"taXX\" again\n7. f o r c e d → \"forced\" (correct)\n8. s n o w → \"snow\"\n9. t o → \"to\" (😍=t, so \"😍o\" is \"to\")\n10. s u b m i t → \"submit\" (correct, 🐦=m)\n11. w i t h → \"with\" (🐶=w)\n12. t h e → \"the\" (😍=t)\n13. t a 🐼🐼 → \"taXX\" again\n14. m i s s i o n → \"mission\" (correct, 🐦=m)\n\nSo the structure is: \"taXX defeated aX snow (5:20) taXX forced snow to submit with the taXX mission.\"\n\nRepeating \"taXX\" three times. So \"taXX\" is a key term here. Let's think of possible 4-letter words starting with \"ta\". Let's list 4-letter \"ta\" words:\n\n- tale (ta + le) → but two letters, not same.\n- talk (ta + lk) → no.\n- tall (ta + ll) → ll. 🐼=l. But attempt 1 guessed 🐼=l and was wrong. So no.\n- tank (ta + nk) → no.\n- task (ta + sk) → sk. But two different letters.\n- tart (ta + rt) → no.\n- tatt (ta + tt) → tt. Maybe \"tatt\" (slang for tattoo), but not sure.\n- tass (ta + ss) → ss. Attempt 2 guessed 🐼=s, which was wrong. So 🐼 can't be s.\n- taut (ta + ut) → no.\n- taft (ta + ft) → no.\n- tabb (ta + bb) → \"tabb\" (maybe a name?), but not common.\n- taff (ta + ff) → \"taff\" (slang for Welsh person), possible.\n- taco (ta + co) → no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"taXX\" is part of a larger word? No, the words are separated by spaces. So \"taXX\" is a 4-letter word. Let's think of the sentence's context. It mentions \"forced snow to submit with the taXX mission.\" So \"taXX mission\" – maybe \"tact mission\"? \"tact\" is 4 letters (t a c t). Oh! \"tact\" would be t a c t. So the two 🐼s would be 'c'? Because \"ta\" + two 'c's would be \"tacc\", which isn't \"tact\". Wait, \"tact\" is t a c t. So that's four letters, t a c t. So if the word is \"tact\", then the structure would be \"t a c t\" – but in the encoded sentence, it's \"t a 🐼🐼\", so two emojis (each representing one letter) after \"ta\". So \"ta\" + two letters (same emoji, so same letter). So \"t a 🐼 🐼\" → \"ta\" + 🐼 + 🐼. So if 🐼 is 'c', then \"ta\" + 'c' + 'c' → \"tacc\". Not \"tact\".\n\nAlternatively, \"team\" → t a e m. But \"taXX\" would need two Xs, so \"taee\" (if X is 'e') → \"taee\" which isn't a word. \"taff\" (t a f f) → if 🐼 is 'f', then \"taff\". Let's check attempt 4: 🐼 was guessed as 'f' and feedback was False. So that's out.\n\nHmm. Let's look at \"a 🐷\". The word is \"a\" followed by 🐷. So \"aX\". In the first part, \"defeated a X snow\". Maybe \"defeated a band snow\"? No. \"defeated a land snow\"? \"land\" would be l a n d, but \"aX\" is \"a\" + X. So \"aX\" is a single letter. So \"aX\" is a one-letter word? No, \"a\" is already a word. So \"aX\" is \"a\" followed by another word. Like \"a [noun]\". So \"a tank\", \"a band\", \"a sand\", etc. But \"aX\" would be \"a\" + X (a single letter). So X is the first letter of the next word. Wait, maybe \"a🐷\" is a two-letter word. Like \"as\", \"at\", \"an\", \"am\", \"ab\", etc. Let's think. The previous attempts guessed 🐷 as 'n' (attempt 1, feedback False), 'b' (attempt 2, False), 'x' (attempt 3, False), 'k' (attempt 4, False), 'c' (attempt 5, False). So all those are wrong. Let's think of other letters. Possible two-letter words starting with 'a' (since \"a\" is the first letter): \"at\" (a + t), \"as\" (a + s), \"an\" (a + n), \"am\" (a + m), \"ab\" (a + b), \"ad\" (a + d), \"ae\" (rare), \"af\" (a + f), \"ag\" (a + g), \"ah\" (a + h), \"ai\" (a + i), \"aj\" (unlikely), \"ak\" (unlikely), \"al\" (a + l), \"ao\" (unlikely), \"ap\" (a + p), \"aq\" (unlikely), \"ar\" (a + r), \"as\" (a + s), \"at\" (a + t), \"au\" (a + u), \"av\" (a + v), \"aw\" (a + w), \"ax\" (a + x), \"ay\" (a + y), \"az\" (unlikely).\n\nFrom previous attempts, 🐷 was guessed as 'n' (attempt 1: 🐷=n → False), 'b' (attempt 2: 🐷=b → False), 'x' (attempt 3: 🐷=x → False), 'k' (attempt 4: 🐷=k → False), 'c' (attempt 5: 🐷=c → False). So possible remaining letters: t, s, d, f, g, h, i, l, o, p, r, u, v, w, y. But \"a🐷\" is part of \"a🐷 sno🐶\" which is \"aX snow\". So \"aX snow\" – \"as snow\" (possible), \"at snow\" (possible), \"an snow\" (but 🐷=n was tried and wrong), \"am snow\" (a m snow?), \"ad snow\", \"af snow\", \"ag snow\", \"ah snow\", \"ai snow\", \"al snow\", \"ap snow\", \"ar snow\", \"au snow\", \"av snow\", \"aw snow\" (a w snow → \"a w snow\"? but 🐶=w, so \"sno🐶\" is \"snow\", so \"a🐷\" is \"a\" + 🐷, and \"sno🐶\" is \"snow\". So \"aX snow\" could be \"as snow\", \"at snow\", etc. Let's see if \"as\" makes sense. \"defeated as snow\" – maybe not. \"defeated at snow\" – \"defeated at snow\" (location?).\n\nAlternatively, \"a🐷\" could be \"ab\" (a b), but \"ab snow\" doesn't make sense. Maybe \"aX\" is part of a larger word. Let's check the entire first part again: \"t a 🐼🐼 d e f e a t e d a 🐷 s n o w\". So \"taXX defeated aX snow\". If \"taXX\" is \"task\", then \"task defeated aX snow\". \"task defeated aX snow\" – maybe \"task defeated a band snow\"? No. \"task defeated a land snow\"? Maybe.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of \"taXX\" as \"tact\". \"tact defeated aX snow\". \"tact forced snow to submit with the tact mission.\" That makes sense. \"tact mission\" sounds plausible. So \"tact\" would be t a c t. But in the encoded sentence, it's \"t a 🐼🐼\", which is two emojis (each is one letter). So \"t a c t\" would require \"t a\" + 🐼 (c) + 🐼 (t). But that would mean two different letters for 🐼, which is impossible because each emoji is a unique letter. So that's not possible.\n\nWait, the two 🐼s are the same emoji, so they must represent the same letter. So \"taXX\" where X is the same letter. So \"tall\" (ll), \"tass\" (ss), \"tatt\" (tt), \"tabb\" (bb), \"taff\" (ff), \"tarr\" (rr), \"tamm\" (mm), \"tagg\" (gg), \"tazz\" (zz). Let's check which of these letters haven't been guessed for 🐼. The previous guesses for 🐼 were l (attempt 1: False), s (attempt 2: False), n (attempt 3: False), f (attempt 4: False), c (attempt 5: False). So possible letters left: t, d, g, h, i, j, k, m, o, p, q, r, u, v, w, x, y, z.\n\nLet's try \"tall\" (ll). But 🐼=l was guessed in attempt 1 and was wrong, so that's out. \"tass\" (ss), 🐼=s was attempt 2, wrong. \"tatt\" (tt) → 🐼=t. But 😍=t, and each emoji is unique, so 🐼 can't be t. \"tabb\" (bb) → 🐼=b. Let's check if that's possible. \"tabb defeated aX snow\". \"tabb\" isn't a common word, but maybe. \"tabb forced snow to submit with the tabb mission.\" Not great. \"taff\" (ff), but 🐼=f was attempt 4, wrong. \"tarr\" (rr) → 🐼=r. Let's consider that. \"tarr\" is a possible name or term. \"tarr defeated aX snow. tarr forced snow to submit with the tarr mission.\" Maybe. \"aX\" could be \"ar\" (a r), but \"a r snow\" → \"a r snow\". Alternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"trap\" but that's t r a p, which would need different letters. No.\n\nAnother angle: \"sub🐦i😍\" → \"subm i t\" (since 🐦=m, 😍=t). That's \"submit\", correct. \"🐶i😍h\" → \"w i t h\" (🐶=w, 😍=t) → \"with\", correct. \"😍he\" → \"the\" (😍=t) → correct. \"🐦ission\" → \"mission\" (🐦=m) → correct. All those parts check out.\n\nLooking at \"a🐷 sno🐶\" → \"aX snow\". If \"aX\" is \"an\", then 🐷=n. But attempt 1 guessed 🐷=n and feedback was False, so that's not it. \"aX\" could be \"as\" (🐷=s). Let's see if that works. \"as snow\" → \"as snow\". \"defeated as snow\" – maybe \"defeated as snow (did something as snow)\". Not sure. \"aX\" could be \"at\" (🐷=t). But 😍=t, so 🐷 can't be t (unique letters). \"aX\" could be \"ab\" (🐷=b). Attempt 2 guessed 🐷=b, feedback was False. \"aX\" could be \"ad\" (🐷=d). Let's see. \"ad snow\" → \"ad snow\". Not helpful. \"aX\" could be \"ag\" (🐷=g). \"ag snow\" → \"ag snow\". \"aX\" could be \"al\" (🐷=l). \"al snow\" → \"al snow\" (maybe a name Al). \"aX\" could be \"ap\" (🐷=p). \"ap snow\" → \"ap snow\". \"aX\" could be \"ar\" (🐷=r). \"ar snow\" → \"ar snow\". \"aX\" could be \"av\" (🐷=v). \"av snow\" → \"av snow\". \"aX\" could be \"aw\" (🐷=w). But 🐶=w, so can't be. \"aX\" could be \"ay\" (🐷=y). \"ay snow\" → \"ay snow\". \"aX\" could be \"az\" (🐷=z). \"az snow\" → \"az snow\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"a🐷\" is a typo or part of a contraction. Not likely. Let's think of the \"taXX\" word again. If \"taXX\" is \"task\", but that would need two different letters. But since the emoji is the same, it's two of the same letters. Maybe \"taXX\" is \"tank\" (t a n k), but that's two different letters. No.\n\nWait, let's check the first part: \"(5: 20)\". Maybe that's a time, like 5:20, but not sure. Let's look at the entire sentence structure again. It seems like a mission-related sentence. \"taXX mission\" – perhaps \"tactical mission\", but that's longer. No, \"taXX\" is 4 letters. \"task mission\" is possible. \"task\" is 4 letters (t a s k). But then \"taXX\" would be \"task\" → t a s k. So the two 🐼s would be 's' and 'k'. But since each 🐼 is the same emoji, they must be the same letter, so that's impossible. So \"task\" can't be.\n\nAnother thought: \"taXX\" could be \"team\". \"team\" is t a e m. But that's four letters, so \"ta\" + two letters (e and m). But again, the two 🐼s are the same emoji, so same letter. So \"taee\" or \"tamm\", which aren't words.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"tale\" (t a l e). But again, two different letters. Not possible.\n\nHmm. Let's try to think of the word \"attack\". No, that's longer. \"taXX\" is 4 letters. Maybe \"tart\" (t a r t). So \"t a r t\". So two 🐼s would be 'r' and 't'. But 't' is taken by 😍=t. So 🐼=r. Let's check if that's possible. If 🐼=r, then \"taXX\" would be \"t a r r\" → \"tarr\". \"tarr defeated aX snow. tarr forced snow to submit with the tarr mission.\" Maybe \"tarr\" is a code name or a place. Possible. Let's check if 🐼=r has been guessed before. Previous guesses for 🐼: l, s, n, f, c. So r hasn't been guessed. So that's a possibility.\n\nWhat about 🐷? Let's think of \"aX\" in \"defeated aX snow\". If \"tarr defeated aX snow\", maybe \"aX\" is \"barr\" → but no, \"aX\" is two letters. \"aX\" could be \"ar\" (a r) → \"a r snow\". But \"a r snow\" → \"a r snow\". Alternatively, \"aX\" could be \"car\" → but \"aX\" is two letters. Maybe \"aX\" is \"man\" → no, \"aX\" is two letters. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"a🐷\" is \"an\" (a n), but attempt 1 guessed 🐷=n and feedback was False. So that's out. \"a🐷\" could be \"as\" (a s). If 🐷=s, then \"a s snow\" → \"as snow\". \"defeated as snow\" → maybe \"defeated as snow (in the role of snow)\". Possible.\n\nBut let's check if 🐷=s has been guessed. Previous attempts: 🐷 was n, b, x, k, c. So s hasn't been guessed. So that's possible.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n🐼=r (since \"taXX\" would be \"tarr\"), and 🐷=s (\"aX\" would be \"as\"). Let's test:\n\nEncoded Sentence with these guesses:\n\n😍=t, 🐼=r, 🐸=d, 😈=f, 🐷=s, 🐶=w, 🐦=m.\n\nSubstituting:\n\n\"t a r r d e f e a t e d a s s n o w (5: 20) t a r r f o r c e d s n o w t o s u b m i t w i t h t h e t a r r m i s s i o n.\"\n\nBreaking into words:\n\n\"tarr defeated as snow (5:20) tarr forced snow to submit with the tarr mission.\"\n\nThat makes sense! \"tarr\" could be a code name or a project name. \"defeated as snow\" might mean they defeated something acting as snow. \"tarr forced snow to submit\" – the Tarr mission forced Snow to submit. It fits. \n\nLet's check if these guesses are possible. 🐼=r hasn't been guessed before (previous guesses were l, s, n, f, c → all wrong). 🐷=s hasn't been guessed (previous guesses n, b, x, k, c → all wrong). So this seems like a plausible guess.\n\nTo solve this Crypto Word Game, we analyze the encoded sentence, feedback history, and known correct mappings. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Known Correct Mappings (from History):\n- 😍=t (confirmed in all attempts)\n- 😈=f (confirmed in all attempts)\n- 🐶=w (confirmed in all attempts)\n- 🐦=m (confirmed in all attempts)\n- 🐸=d (confirmed from attempt 2 onward)\n\n### Focus on Unknowns: 🐼 and 🐷\nThe encoded sentence, with known mappings substituted, is:  \n`t a 🐼🐼 d e f e a t e d a 🐷 s n o w (5: 20) t a 🐼🐼 f o r c e d s n o w t o s u b m i t w i t h t h e t a 🐼🐼 m i s s i o n.`  \n\nKey observations:  \n1. The phrase `t a 🐼🐼` repeats three times, suggesting it is a critical term (likely a 4-letter word starting with \"ta\").  \n2. `a 🐷` appears in the context of `defeated a 🐷 snow`, implying `a 🐷` is a short phrase (e.g., \"as snow\").  \n\n### Deductions:\n- For `t a 🐼🐼`: Since the same emoji (🐼) repeats, it must represent a letter that forms a valid 4-letter word with \"ta.\" Testing possible letters (excluding previously guessed ones: l, s, n, f, c), \"r\" fits, forming \"tarr\" (a plausible code name or term).  \n- For `a 🐷`: The phrase `a 🐷 snow` suggests \"as snow\" (common phrasing). Thus, 🐷=s (not previously guessed).  \n\n### Final Guess:\nThe most plausible mappings for the unknown emojis are 🐼=r and 🐷=s, completing the sentence coherently.\n\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐼=r,🐸=d,😈=f,🐷=s,🐶=w,🐦=m","Okay, let's try to figure out the emojis here. The encoded sentence is: 😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission.\n\nWe know from the hint that 😍=t. Let's start with that. Let's replace 😍 with t in the sentence. So the sentence becomes:\n\nta🐼🐼 🐸e😈eatet🐸 a🐷 snow (5: 20) ta🐼🐼 force🐸 snow to sub🐦it hi😈h the ta🐼🐼🐦ission.\n\nWait, let's parse each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the History gives us some feedback. Let's list what's confirmed:\n\nFrom the feedback:\n\n- 😍=t is correct (all attempts have this as True).\n- 😈=f is correct (all attempts where 😈=f are True).\n- 🐶=w is correct (all attempts where 🐶=w are True).\n- 🐦=m is correct (all attempts where 🐦=m are True).\n- 🐸=d is correct (since in attempt 2, 🐸=d was True, and attempts 3-6 also have 🐸=d with True feedback).\n\nSo let's note those:\n\n😍=t (correct)\n😈=f (correct)\n🐶=w (correct)\n🐦=m (correct)\n🐸=d (correct)\n\nNow, the variables we need to find are 🐼 and 🐷.\n\nLet's substitute the known emojis into the encoded sentence:\n\nOriginal encoded sentence:\n\n😍a🐼🐼 → ta🐼🐼\n🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 → de f eat e d (Wait, let's break down the characters here. Let's see: 🐸 is d, so 🐸e is de. 😈 is f, so 😈e is fe. a is a (since it's a lowercase letter, not an emoji). 😍 is t, so 😍e is te. 🐸 is d. So the whole part is 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 → d e f e a t e d → \"defeated\"? Let's check: d e f e a t e d → \"defeated\" (d e f e a t e d). That makes sense! Because \"defeated\" is a word. So that part is \"defeated\".\n\nSo the first part of the sentence: \"ta🐼🐼 defeated a🐷 snow (5: 20) ta🐼🐼 force d snow to subm it hi😈h the ta🐼🐼mission.\"\n\nWait, let's re-express the entire sentence with known substitutions:\n\nEncoded Sentence parts:\n\n1. 😍a🐼🐼 → t a 🐼 🐼 → \"ta__\" (two letters, since 🐼 is one emoji, so two emojis here, so two letters. So \"ta\" followed by two of the same letter? Because the emoji is the same, so 🐼 is a single letter, so \"taXX\" where XX is two of the same letter? Wait, no: each emoji represents a single letter. So 😍a🐼🐼 is t a [🐼] [🐼]. So \"ta\" followed by two of the same character (since 🐼 is one emoji, so each 🐼 is the same letter). So \"ta\" + 🐼 + 🐼 → \"taLL\" if 🐼=l, but in attempt 1, 🐼=l was wrong. So \"taXX\", where XX is two of the same letter.\n\nNext part: 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 → d e f e a t e d → \"defeated\" (correct, since d e f e a t e d is \"defeated\"). That works! So that part is \"defeated\".\n\nThen: a🐷 → a [🐷]. So \"a\" followed by the letter for 🐷.\n\nThen \"sno🐶\" → sno + w → \"snow\" (since 🐶=w, so \"snow\"). That's correct.\n\nThen (5:20) which is probably a time or score, not relevant for letters.\n\nNext: 😍a🐼🐼 → same as before: \"taXX\".\n\nThen \"😈orce🐸\" → f orce + d → \"forced\" (f o r c e d → \"forced\"). That's correct! So \"forced\".\n\nThen \"sno🐶\" → \"snow\" again.\n\nThen \"😍o\" → t o → \"to\".\n\nThen \"sub🐦i😍\" → sub + m + i + t → \"submit\" (s u b m i t). Yes! \"submit\".\n\nThen \"🐶i😍h\" → w i t h → \"with\".\n\nThen \"😍he\" → t he → \"the\".\n\nThen \"😍a🐼🐼🐦ission\" → t a 🐼 🐼 m i s s i o n → \"taXXmission\". Let's see: \"taXXmission\". So \"ta\" + 🐼 + 🐼 + \"mission\" (since 🐦=m, so 🐦ission is mission). So \"taXXmission\".\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence becomes:\n\n\"taXX defeated aX snow (5: 20) taXX forced snow to submit with the taXXmission.\"\n\nNow, let's look for \"taXX\" which appears multiple times. Let's think of possible two-letter words starting with \"ta\". Common ones: \"task\", \"tall\", \"tank\", \"team\", \"tart\", \"tact\", \"trap\", \"twin\" (no, \"twin\" is t-w-i-n), \"tack\", \"tail\", \"take\", \"tale\", \"tarp\", \"tass\", \"tans\", \"tads\", \"taps\", \"tans\", etc.\n\nBut \"taXXmission\" would be \"ta\" + XX + \"mission\". So \"taXXmission\" → \"ta[XX]mission\". For example, \"taskmission\" (no), \"tactmission\" (maybe \"tactical mission\"? No, \"tactmission\" isn't a word. \"Tailmission\"? Maybe \"tail mission\"? \"Tankmission\"? No. Alternatively, maybe \"taXX\" is part of a compound word. Let's think of \"ta\" + XX + \"mission\". Let's see: \"ta\" + \"sk\" → \"taskmission\"? No. \"ta\" + \"rg\" → \"targmission\" (not a word). \"ta\" + \"ct\" → \"tactmission\". \"ta\" + \"lp\" → \"talpmission\" (no). \"ta\" + \"nt\" → \"tantmission\". \"ta\" + \"ck\" → \"tackmission\". \"ta\" + \"ll\" → \"tallmission\". \"ta\" + \"lk\" → \"talkmission\". \"ta\" + \"rn\" → \"tarnmission\". \"ta\" + \"sp\" → \"taspmission\". \"ta\" + \"st\" → \"tastmission\". \"ta\" + \"rs\" → \"tarsmission\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"taXX\" is \"task\", so \"task\". Then \"taXXmission\" would be \"taskmission\" (unlikely). \"taXX\" could be \"tank\" → \"tankmission\". \"taXX\" could be \"tact\" → \"tactmission\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"taXX\" is \"team\". Then \"teamission\"? No. \"taXX\" could be \"trap\" → \"trapmission\". \"taXX\" could be \"tram\" → \"trammission\". \"taXX\" could be \"tarp\" → \"tarpmission\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"taXX\" is part of a longer word. Let's look at the first part: \"taXX defeated aX snow\". Let's suppose \"taXX\" is a noun. Maybe \"tank\" → \"tank defeated aX snow\". \"Tank\" makes sense as a noun. \"Task defeated aX snow\" → maybe. \"Tail defeated...\" → not so much. \"Tall\" → \"tall defeated...\" → possible but less likely. \"Tact\" → \"tact defeated...\" → possible. \"Trap\" → \"trap defeated...\" → possible.\n\nNow, the \"aX\" part: \"a\" followed by the letter for 🐷. So \"a\" + [🐷]. Let's see possible letters. The 🐷 emoji's letter is unknown, let's call it P. So \"aP\".\n\nWhat could \"aP\" be? \"aP\" could be \"ap\" (as in \"ap\" as a prefix, but not likely), \"ab\", \"ad\", \"af\", \"ag\", \"ah\", \"ai\", \"ak\", \"al\", \"am\", \"an\", \"ao\", \"ap\", \"aq\", \"ar\", \"as\", \"at\", \"au\", \"av\", \"aw\", \"ax\", \"ay\", \"az\". Let's think of possible words. For example, \"a tank defeated a...\" → \"a tank defeated a...\" → \"a tank defeated a car snow\"? No. \"a tank defeated a man snow\"? No. \"a tank defeated a big snow\"? Maybe \"a big snow\" → but \"aX\" would be \"ab\" if 🐷=b, but in attempt 2, 🐷=b was False. Attempt 5: 🐷=c (False). Attempt 6: 🐷=s (False). Attempt 1: 🐷=n (False). Attempt 3: 🐷=x (False). Attempt 4: 🐷=k (False). So 🐷 can't be b, c, k, n, s, x. So possible letters left (assuming letters are a-z, and no duplicates, but maybe duplicates? The problem says \"each letter with a unique emoji\", so each emoji is a unique letter, so no duplicates. So the letters used so far are:\n\n😍=t, 😈=f, 🐶=w, 🐦=m, 🐸=d. So used letters: t, f, w, m, d. So possible letters for 🐼 and 🐷 are the remaining letters (a, b, c, e, g, h, i, j, k, l, n, o, p, q, r, s, u, v, x, y, z), but from the history, some have been tried for 🐼 and 🐷.\n\nFor 🐼, attempts 1-6 guessed l, s, n, f, c, r, all wrong. So 🐼 can't be l, s, n, f, c, r. So remaining possible letters for 🐼: a, b, e, g, h, i, j, k, o, p, q, t (but t is taken by 😍), u, v, x, y, z.\n\nFor 🐷, attempts 1: n (False), 2: b (False), 3: x (False), 4: k (False), 5: c (False), 6: s (False). So 🐷 can't be n, b, x, k, c, s. So possible letters: a, d (taken by 🐸), e, f (taken by 😈), g, h, i, j, l, m (taken by 🐦), o, p, q, r, t (taken), u, v, w (taken by 🐶), y, z.\n\nSo possible letters for 🐼 and 🐷.\n\nLet's go back to \"taXX defeated aX snow\". Let's think of \"taXX\" as \"task\". Then \"task defeated aX snow\". \"Task\" makes sense. \"Task defeated a...\" → \"a\" + X. If X is \"g\", then \"ag\" (as in \"ag\" for agriculture, but not likely). \"aX\" could be \"an\" → \"aX = an\" (if 🐷=n, but attempt 1 had 🐷=n which was False). \"aX\" could be \"at\" → \"aX=at\" (if 🐷=t, but t is taken). \"aX\" could be \"as\" → \"as\" (if 🐷=s, but attempt 6 had 🐷=s which was False). \"aX\" could be \"ap\" → \"ap\" (if 🐷=p, possible). \"aX\" could be \"ar\" → \"ar\" (if 🐷=r, but attempt 6 had 🐼=r which was False, but 🐷 is a different emoji, so 🐷=r is possible? Wait, the problem says each emoji is a unique letter, but different emojis can have different letters. So if 🐼=r was wrong, that's about 🐼, but 🐷 could be r. But let's check.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at \"taXXmission\". If \"taXXmission\" is \"tactmission\" → \"tact mission\"? Maybe. \"taXX\" could be \"tact\" (t a c t). But in attempt 5, 🐼=c was guessed (so 🐼=c would make \"taXX\" = \"ta cc\"? No, \"ta\" + 🐼 + 🐼 → \"ta\" + c + c → \"tacc\". \"tacc mission\" → \"tacc mission\"? Doesn't make sense. \"taXX\" could be \"tact\" → \"t a c t\" but that would require two different emojis (since \"c\" and \"t\" are different letters), but here 🐼 is a single emoji, so \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + 🐼 + 🐼 → \"ta\" + same letter twice. So \"taLL\" (if 🐼=l), but attempt 1 had 🐼=l (False). \"taSS\" (if 🐼=s, attempt 2: False). \"taNN\" (attempt 3: 🐼=n, False). \"taFF\" (attempt 4: 🐼=f, but 😈=f, so can't be. Also attempt 4: 🐼=f was False). \"taCC\" (attempt 5: 🐼=c, False). \"taRR\" (attempt 6: 🐼=r, False). So \"taXX\" is \"ta\" followed by two of the same letter, which we've tried l, s, n, f, c, r, all wrong. So possible letters left for 🐼 are a, b, e, g, h, i, j, k, o, p, q, u, v, x, y, z.\n\nLet's think of \"taXX\" as \"tall\" (taLL). But attempt 1 had 🐼=l (False). So that's out. \"tass\" (taSS) → attempt 2: 🐼=s (False). \"tann\" (taNN) → attempt 3: 🐼=n (False). \"taff\" (taFF) → attempt 4: 🐼=f (False). \"tacc\" (taCC) → attempt 5: 🐼=c (False). \"tarr\" (taRR) → attempt 6: 🐼=r (False). So none of those.\n\nWhat's another possibility? \"taXX\" could be \"task\" → but that's t a s k. No, because 🐼 is a single letter, so \"taXX\" would be t a [same letter] [same letter]. So \"taKK\" (if 🐼=k), but attempt 4: 🐷=k (False), but 🐼=k hasn't been tried. Let's check. If 🐼=k, then \"taXX\" would be \"taKK\". Let's see if that fits. \"taKK defeated aX snow\". \"taKK\" → \"takk\" (not a word, but maybe a name or acronym). \"taKKmission\" → \"takkmission\" (unlikely).\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"taGG\" (taGG). \"Tagg\" could be a name. \"Tagg defeated aX snow\". \"Tagg mission\" → possible.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"taHH\" (taHH). \"Tahh\" (like \"tahh\" as an exclamation, but not a noun).\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"taJJ\" (taJJ). Unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"taPP\" (taPP). \"Tapp\" could be a name. \"Tapp defeated aX snow\". \"Tapp mission\" → possible.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"taYY\" (taYY). Unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"taZZ\" (taZZ). Unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"taOO\" (taOO). \"Taos\" is a place, but \"taOO\" would be \"taoo\", not \"taos\".\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"taWI\" → no, because 🐼 is the same letter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"taXX\" is part of a longer word. Let's look at the entire sentence again:\n\n\"taXX defeated aX snow (5: 20) taXX forced snow to submit with the taXXmission.\"\n\nThe structure is: [taXX] defeated [aX snow] (5:20) [taXX] forced snow to submit with the [taXXmission].\n\nSo \"taXX\" is a noun that's doing the defeating and forcing. Maybe it's a code name or a project name. Let's think of \"taXXmission\" → maybe \"taXX\" is part of \"taXXmission\". For example, \"tactical mission\" → but \"tactical\" is t a c t i c a l. No. \"Task force mission\"? \"Task\" would be \"task\", but \"taXX\" would need to be \"task\" (t a s k), but \"taXX\" is t a [same letter] [same letter]. So \"task\" would require two different letters (s and k), which isn't possible here. So \"taXXmission\" would need to be \"ta\" + [same letter] x2 + \"mission\".\n\nLet's think of \"taXXmission\" as \"tankmission\". \"Tank mission\" → possible. \"Tank\" is t a n k. But \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + n + n → \"tann\", which is attempt 3 (🐼=n, which was False). So no.\n\nAlternatively, \"tarpmission\" → \"tarp\" is t a r p. \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + r + r → \"tarr\", which was attempt 6 (🐼=r, False).\n\nAlternatively, \"tassmission\" → \"tass\" is t a s s. \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + s + s → \"tass\", attempt 2 (🐼=s, False).\n\nAlternatively, \"tactmission\" → \"tact\" is t a c t. \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + c + c → \"tacc\", attempt 5 (🐼=c, False).\n\nAlternatively, \"tallmission\" → \"tall\" is t a l l. \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + l + l → \"tall\", attempt 1 (🐼=l, False).\n\nHmm. Maybe \"taXX\" is \"team\" → t a e m. But \"taXX\" would be t a [same letter] [same letter], so \"taee\" (if 🐼=e). Let's check if 🐼=e is possible. Attempts 1-6 didn't try 🐼=e. So \"taee\" → \"taee\" (not a word), but \"taee mission\" → maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"taeg\" → no, same letter needed.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"taaa\" (if 🐼=a). Let's check. If 🐼=a, then \"taXX\" is \"taaa\". \"taaa defeated aX snow\". That's not a word. \"taaa mission\" → no. So probably not.\n\nWhat about the \"aX\" part. \"aX\" is \"a\" + 🐷. Let's think of \"aX\" as \"arm\" → but \"arm\" is three letters, \"aX\" is two. \"aX\" could be \"art\" → \"aX=art\" (but \"aX\" is two letters). Wait, \"aX\" is \"a\" followed by the letter for 🐷, so \"aP\". Let's think of \"aP\" as \"a unit\" → \"a unit snow\"? No. \"aP\" could be \"a group\" → \"a group snow\"? No. \"aP\" could be \"a force\" → but \"force\" is already in the sentence (\"force d\" → \"forced\"). \"aP\" could be \"a tank\" → but \"tank\" is \"taXX\" if 🐼=n (but attempt 3 was 🐼=n, False). \"aP\" could be \"a car\" → \"a car snow\" → possible. But \"a car\" would be \"ac\" (if 🐷=c), but attempt 5 had 🐷=c (False). \"aP\" could be \"a van\" → \"av\" (if 🐷=v). \"a van snow\" → possible. \"aP\" could be \"a bus\" → \"ab\" (if 🐷=b), attempt 2: 🐷=b (False). \"aP\" could be \"a jet\" → \"aj\" (if 🐷=j). \"a jet snow\" → possible. \"aP\" could be \"a big\" → \"ab\" (no, \"ab\" is two letters). \"aP\" could be \"a new\" → \"an\" (if 🐷=n), attempt 1: 🐷=n (False). \"aP\" could be \"a bad\" → \"ab\" (no). \"aP\" could be \"a red\" → \"ar\" (if 🐷=r). \"a red snow\" → possible. \"a red\" would be \"ar\" (if 🐷=r). But attempt 6: 🐼=r (False), but 🐷=r is possible. Let's check.\n\nIf 🐷=r, then \"aX\" is \"ar\" → \"a ar snow\" → \"a ar snow\" → \"a ar snow\" → \"a ar\" doesn't make sense. \"a ar\" → \"a ar\" is incorrect grammar. Should be \"an ar\" if \"ar\" starts with a vowel, but \"ar\" starts with 'a', which is a vowel. So \"an ar snow\". But the original is \"aX\" → \"a\" + X. So \"a ar\" would be incorrect. So maybe \"aX\" is a noun. Like \"a tank\", \"a car\", \"a van\", \"a jet\", etc. Let's think of \"aX\" as \"a unit\" → \"au\" (if 🐷=u). \"a unit snow\" → possible. \"aX=au\" → \"au\" is a valid two-letter word (as in \"au\" for gold, but not sure). \"a au snow\" → \"a au snow\" → \"a au\" is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, \"aX\" could be \"a bug\" → \"ab\" (no). \"aX\" could be \"a dog\" → \"ad\" (if 🐷=d). But 🐸=d (taken), so 🐷 can't be d. \"aX\" could be \"a cat\" → \"ac\" (if 🐷=c, attempt 5: False). \"aX\" could be \"a pig\" → \"ap\" (if 🐷=p). \"a pig snow\" → possible. \"a pig\" → \"ap\" (if 🐷=p). Let's check \"ap\" → \"a ap snow\" → \"a ap\" is incorrect. Should be \"a pig\" → \"a pig\" would require \"a\" + \"pig\" (three letters), but \"aX\" is two letters. So maybe \"aX\" is a two-letter word. Two-letter words starting with 'a': \"aa\" (lava), \"ab\" (abbreviation), \"ad\" (advertisement), \"ae\" (a type of rye), \"ag\" (agriculture), \"ah\" (exclamation), \"ai\" (a three-toed sloth), \"al\" (short for Alan), \"am\" (I am), \"an\" (article), \"ao\" (a type of tree), \"ap\" (apostrophe), \"ar\" (argon), \"as\" (as in), \"at\" (preposition), \"aw\" (exclamation), \"ax\" (tool), \"ay\" (yes).\n\nSo \"aX\" could be one of these. Let's consider \"aX\" as \"an\" → \"an\" (if 🐷=n). But attempt 1: 🐷=n (False). \"aX\" as \"as\" → \"as\" (if 🐷=s). Attempt 6: 🐷=s (False). \"aX\" as \"at\" → \"at\" (if 🐷=t). But 😍=t (taken). \"aX\" as \"ax\" → \"ax\" (if 🐷=x). Attempt 3: 🐷=x (False). \"aX\" as \"ar\" → \"ar\" (if 🐷=r). \"ar\" is a valid two-letter word (argon). \"a ar snow\" → \"a ar snow\" → \"a ar\" is incorrect. Should be \"an ar\" since \"ar\" starts with a vowel. So \"an ar snow\". But the original is \"aX\", so \"a ar\" would be incorrect. So maybe \"aX\" is \"ag\" (if 🐷=g). \"ag\" is short for agriculture. \"a ag snow\" → \"a ag snow\" → \"a ag\" is incorrect. \"aX\" as \"al\" (if 🐷=l). \"al\" is a short name. \"a al snow\" → \"a al\" is incorrect. \"aX\" as \"ah\" (if 🐷=h). \"ah\" is an exclamation. \"a ah snow\" → \"a ah\" is incorrect. \"aX\" as \"ai\" (if 🐷=i). \"ai\" is a sloth. \"a ai snow\" → \"a ai\" is incorrect. \"aX\" as \"ae\" (if 🐷=e). \"ae\" is a type of rye. \"a ae snow\" → \"a ae\" is incorrect. \"aX\" as \"ao\" (if 🐷=o). \"ao\" is a tree. \"a ao snow\" → \"a ao\" is incorrect. \"aX\" as \"ap\" (if 🐷=p). \"ap\" is an apostrophe. \"a ap snow\" → \"a ap\" is incorrect. \"aX\" as \"aw\" (if 🐷=w). But 🐶=w (taken). \"aX\" as \"ay\" (if 🐷=y). \"ay\" is yes. \"a ay snow\" → \"a ay\" is incorrect. \"aX\" as \"ad\" (if 🐷=d). But 🐸=d (taken). \"aX\" as \"ab\" (if 🐷=b). Attempt 2: 🐷=b (False). \"aX\" as \"aa\" (if 🐷=a). \"aa\" is lava. \"a aa snow\" → \"a aa\" is incorrect.\n\nThis is getting tricky. Let's try another angle. Let's look at \"taXXmission\". If \"taXXmission\" is \"tactical mission\" → but \"tactical\" is t a c t i c a l. No. \"taXXmission\" could be \"task force mission\" → but \"task\" is t a s k, which would need \"taXX\" to be \"task\", but that's four letters with two different emojis (s and k). Not possible here. \"taXXmission\" could be \"tank mission\" → \"tank\" is t a n k. \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + n + n → \"tann\", which was attempt 3 (🐼=n, False). So no.\n\nWait, let's check the first part again: \"taXX defeated aX snow\". If \"taXX\" is \"team\", then \"team defeated aX snow\". \"Team\" is t e a m. But \"taXX\" is t a [same letter] [same letter]. So \"taXX\" would be \"taee\" (if 🐼=e). \"taee\" is not a word. \"taee defeated aX snow\" → doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"taco\" → t a c o. \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + c + c → \"tacc\", attempt 5 (False).\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"tart\" → t a r t. \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + r + r → \"tarr\", attempt 6 (False).\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"tass\" → t a s s. \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + s + s → \"tass\", attempt 2 (False).\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"tall\" → t a l l. \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + l + l → \"tall\", attempt 1 (False).\n\nSo all the common \"ta\" words with double letters have been tried and failed. So maybe \"taXX\" is a less common word or a name. Let's think of \"taXX\" as \"tagg\" (a name). \"Tagg defeated aX snow\". \"Tagg mission\" → possible. So if 🐼=g, then \"taXX\" is \"tagg\". Let's check if 🐼=g is possible. Attempts 1-6 didn't try 🐼=g. So that's a possibility.\n\nIf 🐼=g, then \"taXX\" is \"tagg\". Let's substitute into the sentence:\n\n\"tagg defeated aX snow (5: 20) tagg forced snow to submit with the taggmission.\"\n\n\"Taggmission\" → \"tagg mission\". That could work as a name. Now, \"aX\" is \"a\" + 🐷. Let's see. \"tagg defeated aX snow\" → \"Tagg defeated a [X] snow\". What could \"aX\" be? If \"aX\" is \"a van\" → \"av\" (if 🐷=v). \"a van snow\" → possible. \"aX\" could be \"a jet\" → \"aj\" (if 🐷=j). \"a jet snow\" → possible. \"aX\" could be \"a big\" → \"ab\" (no). \"aX\" could be \"a red\" → \"ar\" (if 🐷=r). \"a red snow\" → possible.\n\nAlternatively, \"aX\" could be \"a bug\" → \"ab\" (no). Let's think of \"aX\" as \"a unit\" → \"au\" (if 🐷=u). \"a unit snow\" → possible.\n\nAlternatively, \"aX\" could be \"a group\" → \"ag\" (if 🐷=g). But 🐼=g, so 🐷 can't be g (since each emoji has a unique letter).\n\nAlternatively, \"aX\" could be \"a car\" → \"ac\" (if 🐷=c, attempt 5: False). \"aX\" could be \"a bus\" → \"ab\" (attempt 2: False). \"aX\" could be \"a new\" → \"an\" (attempt 1: False). \"aX\" could be \"a bad\" → \"ab\" (no). \"aX\" could be \"a cat\" → \"ac\" (no). \"aX\" could be \"a dog\" → \"ad\" (taken by 🐸=d). So \"aX\" could be \"aj\" (if 🐷=j), \"av\" (if 🐷=v), \"au\" (if 🐷=u), \"ae\" (if 🐷=e), \"ao\" (if 🐷=o), \"ap\" (if 🐷=p), \"aq\" (if 🐷=q), \"ay\" (if 🐷=y), \"az\" (if 🐷=z).\n\nLet's consider \"aX\" as \"aj\" (if 🐷=j). Then \"a aj snow\" → \"a aj snow\" → \"a aj\" is incorrect. Should be \"an aj\" if \"aj\" starts with a vowel. \"aj\" starts with 'a', so \"an aj\". But the original is \"aX\", so \"a aj\" is incorrect. So maybe \"aX\" is \"av\" (if 🐷=v). \"a av snow\" → \"a av\" is incorrect. \"an av\" → \"an av\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"aX\" is a noun. For example, \"aX\" could be \"arm\" → but \"arm\" is three letters. \"aX\" is two letters. So perhaps \"aX\" is a code or abbreviation.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the word \"sub🐦i😍\" → \"sub\" + 🐦 + \"i\" + 😍 → \"sub\" + m + \"i\" + t → \"submit\" (s u b m i t). That's correct. So \"submit\" fits.\n\nThe next part is \"🐶i😍h\" → 🐶 + \"i\" + 😍 + \"h\" → w + i + t + h → \"with\". Correct.\n\nThen \"😍he\" → t + h + e → \"the\". Correct.\n\nSo all those parts check out. Now, \"😈orce🐸\" → 😈 + o + r + c + e + 🐸 → f + o + r + c + e + d → \"forced\". Correct.\n\nSo the only parts left are \"taXX\", \"aX\", and \"taXXmission\".\n\nLet's try another approach. Let's list all the occurrences of 🐼:\n\nEncoded sentence has:\n\n😍a🐼🐼 → t a 🐼 🐼 → \"taXX\"\n\n😍a🐼🐼 → same as above.\n\n😍a🐼🐼🐦ission → t a 🐼 🐼 m i s s i o n → \"taXXmission\"\n\nSo 🐼 appears 2 times in the first word, 2 times in the fourth word, and 2 times in the last part (taXXmission). So total of 6 🐼 emojis.\n\nThe history shows that in attempts 1-6, 🐼 was guessed as l, s, n, f, c, r, all wrong. So 🐼 must be another letter.\n\nLet's think of \"taXXmission\" as \"tactical mission\" → no, but \"taXXmission\" could be \"tact mission\". \"Tact mission\" → possible. \"tact\" is t a c t. But \"taXX\" is t a [same letter] [same letter], so \"tact\" would need \"ta\" + c + t → different letters, which isn't possible. So no.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXXmission\" could be \"task mission\". \"task\" is t a s k. Again, different letters. So no.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXXmission\" could be \"tank mission\". \"tank\" is t a n k. Again, different letters. So no.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXXmission\" could be \"target mission\". \"target\" is t a r g e t. No, \"taXX\" is two letters.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXXmission\" could be \"talisman mission\". No, \"talisman\" is longer.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"trap\" → t a r p. \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + r + r → \"tarr\", attempt 6 (False). So no.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"twin\" → t w i n. \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + w + w → \"taww\". But 🐶=w, so 🐼 can't be w. So no.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"tusk\" → t u s k. \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + u + u → \"ta uu\". Unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"tuba\" → t u b a. \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + u + u → \"ta uu\". No.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"tuna\" → t u n a. \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + u + u → \"ta uu\". No.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"tutu\" → t u t u. \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + u + u → \"ta uu\". No.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"toga\" → t o g a. \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + o + o → \"taoo\". No.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"tomo\" → t o m o. \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + o + o → \"taoo\". No.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"taco\" → t a c o. \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + c + c → \"tacc\", attempt 5 (False).\n\nHmm. Let's think of \"taXX\" as \"tass\" (t a s s). But attempt 2 had 🐼=s (False). So no.\n\nWhat if \"taXX\" is \"tact\" → t a c t. But \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + c + t → different letters. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"taXX\" is a typo or a brand name. Like \"Taco\" (but \"taXX\" would need to be \"tacc\" if 🐼=c, which was attempt 5: False).\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the word \"taXX\" as \"tank\" → but \"taXX\" is two letters. No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"taXX\" is \"task\" → \"task\" is four letters. No.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"tall\" → attempt 1: 🐼=l (False). So no.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"toll\" → t o l l. \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + o + o → \"taoo\". No.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"tool\" → t o o l. \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + o + o → \"taoo\". No.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"toil\" → t o i l. \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + o + o → \"taoo\". No.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"toll\" → same as above.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"twin\" → t w i n. \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + w + w → \"taww\". 🐶=w, so 🐼 can't be w.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"tusk\" → t u s k. \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + u + u → \"ta uu\". No.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"turf\" → t u r f. \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + u + u → \"ta uu\". No.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"turn\" → t u r n. \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + u + u → \"ta uu\". No.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"tusk\" → same as above.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"tint\" → t i n t. \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + i + i → \"ta ii\". No.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"till\" → t i l l. \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + i + i → \"ta ii\". No.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"tiff\" → t i f f. \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + i + i → \"ta ii\". No.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"tiff\" → t i f f. \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + f + f → \"taff\", attempt 4 (🐼=f, False).\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" could be \"tiff\" → no.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let's try to think of the \"aX\" part again. The word \"aX\" is followed by \"snow\". So \"aX snow\" → maybe \"aX\" is an adjective. For example, \"a heavy snow\", \"a light snow\", \"a deep snow\", etc. So \"aX\" could be \"he\" (if 🐷=h → \"a he snow\" → no). \"li\" (if 🐷=l → \"a li snow\" → \"a light snow\"? But \"li\" is not \"light\". \"de\" (if 🐷=e → \"a de snow\" → \"a deep snow\"? No. \"th\" (if 🐷=h → \"a th snow\" → \"a thick snow\"? No. \"bi\" (if 🐷=b → \"a bi snow\" → \"a big snow\"? Attempt 2: 🐷=b (False). \"he\" (if 🐷=h → \"a he snow\" → \"a heavy snow\"? No. \"li\" (if 🐷=l → \"a li snow\" → \"a light snow\"? Attempt 1: 🐼=l (False), but 🐷=l is possible. \"a li snow\" → \"a light snow\" → \"li\" is part of \"light\". But \"a li snow\" is not correct. It should be \"a light snow\". So \"aX\" would need to be \"li\" (if 🐷=l), but \"li\" is two letters. \"a li snow\" → \"a li snow\" → \"a light snow\" → but \"li\" is not \"light\". So that's not right.\n\nAlternatively, \"aX snow\" could be \"a snow\" → but \"aX\" would be \"a \" (no). \"aX\" could be \"a fresh snow\" → \"fr\" (if 🐷=r → \"a fr snow\" → \"a fresh snow\"? \"fr\" is part of \"fresh\". \"a fr snow\" → \"a fresh snow\" → but \"fr\" is two letters. So \"a fr snow\" → \"a fresh snow\". That could work. So \"aX\" is \"fr\" (if 🐷=r). But attempt 6: 🐼=r (False), but 🐷=r is possible. So \"a fr snow\" → \"a fresh snow\". Let's check. If 🐷=r, then \"aX\" is \"ar\" → \"a ar snow\" → \"a ar snow\" → \"a ar\" is incorrect. So no.\n\nAlternatively, \"aX snow\" could be \"a powdery snow\" → \"po\" (if 🐷=p → \"a po snow\" → \"a powdery snow\"? No. \"po\" is two letters. \"a po snow\" → \"a powdery snow\" → not matching.\n\nAlternatively, \"aX snow\" could be \"a wet snow\" → \"we\" (if 🐷=e → \"a we snow\" → \"a wet snow\"? \"we\" is two letters. \"a we snow\" → \"a wet snow\" → \"we\" is part of \"wet\". So \"a we snow\" → \"a wet snow\". That could work. So \"aX\" is \"we\" (if 🐷=e). So \"a we snow\" → \"a wet snow\". Let's check. If 🐷=e, then \"aX\" is \"ae\" → \"a ae snow\" → \"a ae snow\" → \"a ae\" is incorrect. So no.\n\nAlternatively, \"aX snow\" could be \"a soft snow\" → \"so\" (if 🐷=o → \"a so snow\" → \"a soft snow\"? \"so\" is two letters. \"a so snow\" → \"a soft snow\" → \"so\" is part of \"soft\". So \"a so snow\" → \"a soft snow\". That could work. So \"aX\" is \"so\" (if 🐷=o). \"a so snow\" → \"a soft snow\". Let's check. If 🐷=o, then \"aX\" is \"ao\" → \"a ao snow\" → \"a ao snow\" → \"a ao\" is incorrect. So no.\n\nAlternatively, \"aX snow\" could be \"a hard snow\" → \"ha\" (if 🐷=h → \"a ha snow\" → \"a hard snow\"? \"ha\" is two letters. \"a ha snow\" → \"a hard snow\" → \"ha\" is part of \"hard\". So \"a ha snow\" → \"a hard snow\". That could work. So \"aX\" is \"ha\" (if 🐷=h). \"a ha snow\" → \"a hard snow\". Let's check. If 🐷=h, then \"aX\" is \"ah\" → \"a ah snow\" → \"a ah snow\" → \"a ah\" is incorrect. So no.\n\nAlternatively, \"aX snow\" could be \"a thick snow\" → \"th\" (if 🐷=h → \"a th snow\" → \"a thick snow\"? \"th\" is two letters. \"a th snow\" → \"a thick snow\" → \"th\" is part of \"thick\". So \"a th snow\" → \"a thick snow\". That could work. So \"aX\" is \"th\" (if 🐷=h). \"a th snow\" → \"a thick snow\". Let's check. If 🐷=h, then \"aX\" is \"ah\" → \"a ah snow\" → \"a ah snow\" → \"a ah\" is incorrect. So no.\n\nThis is getting me stuck. Let's try to think of the \"taXXmission\" again. If \"taXXmission\" is \"tactmission\", but \"tact\" is t a c t. So \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + c + t → \"tact\". But \"taXX\" is two emojis of 🐼, so \"taXX\" is \"ta\" + 🐼 + 🐼. So \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + c + c → \"tacc\" (if 🐼=c), which attempt 5 said was False. So no.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXXmission\" could be \"tankmission\" → \"tank\" is t a n k. \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + n + n → \"tann\" (attempt 3: 🐼=n, False). So no.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXXmission\" could be \"taskmission\" → \"task\" is t a s k. \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + s + s → \"tass\" (attempt 2: 🐼=s, False). So no.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXXmission\" could be \"tallmission\" → \"tall\" is t a l l. \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + l + l → \"tall\" (attempt 1: 🐼=l, False). So no.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXXmission\" could be \"tarpmission\" → \"tarp\" is t a r p. \"taXX\" would be \"ta\" + r + r → \"tarr\" (attempt 6: 🐼=r, False). So no.\n\nSo all the common possibilities for \"taXX\" have been tried and failed. That suggests that \"taXX\" might be a less common word or a proper noun. Let's think of \"taXX\" as \"tagg\" (a name), \"tagg\" defeated \"aX\" snow. \"Tagg mission\" → possible. So if 🐼=g, then \"taXX\" is \"tagg\". Let's assume 🐼=g.\n\nThen, \"taXXmission\" is \"taggmission\" → \"tagg mission\".\n\nNow, \"aX\" is \"a\" + 🐷. Let's assume 🐷=u. Then \"aX\" is \"au\". \"a au snow\" → \"a au snow\" → \"a au\" is incorrect, but maybe it's a code name. Alternatively, \"aX\" could be \"aj\" (if 🐷=j), \"av\" (if 🐷=v), \"ap\" (if 🐷=p), etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"aX\" is \"an\" (if 🐷=n), but attempt 1: 🐷=n (False). So no.\n\nAlternatively, \"aX\" could be \"ag\" (if 🐷=g), but 🐼=g, so 🐷 can't be g.\n\nAlternatively, \"aX\" could be \"at\" (if 🐷=t), but 😍=t (taken). So no.\n\nAlternatively, \"aX\" could be \"as\" (if 🐷=s), attempt 6: 🐷=s (False). So no.\n\nAlternatively, \"aX\" could be \"ax\" (if 🐷=x), attempt 3: 🐷=x (False). So no.\n\nAlternatively, \"aX\" could be \"ay\" (if 🐷=y). So \"a ay snow\" → \"a ay snow\". \"ay\" is a valid two-letter word (yes). \"a ay snow\" → \"a ay snow\" → \"a ay\" is incorrect. Should be \"an ay\" since \"ay\" starts with a vowel. So \"an ay snow\". But the original is \"aX\", so \"a ay\" is incorrect. So maybe \"aX\" is \"ay\" (if 🐷=y), and the sentence has a typo. Unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, \"aX\" could be \"az\" (if 🐷=z). \"a az snow\" → \"a az snow\". \"az\" is a valid two-letter word (Arizona). \"a az snow\" → \"a Arizona snow\" → possible. So \"a az snow\" → \"a Arizona snow\". That makes sense. So \"aX\" is \"az\" (if 🐷=z). So \"a az snow\" → \"a Arizona snow\". That's a possibility.\n\nSo if 🐷=z, then \"aX\" is \"az\" → \"a az snow\" → \"a Arizona snow\". That works. Let's check if 🐷=z is possible. Attempts 1-6 didn't guess 🐷=z, so it's possible.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n😍=t (correct)\n😈=f (correct)\n🐶=w (correct)\n🐦=m (correct)\n🐸=d (correct)\n🐼=g (guessed now)\n🐷=z (guessed now)\n\nLet's check if this fits:\n\nEncoded sentence with substitutions:\n\n😍a🐼🐼 → t a g g → \"tagg\"\n🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 → d e f e a t e d → \"defeated\"\na🐷 → a z → \"az\"\nsno🐶 → s n o w → \"snow\"\n(5: 20) → (5: 20)\n😍a🐼🐼 → t a g g → \"tagg\"\n😈orce🐸 → f o r c e d → \"forced\"\nsno🐶 → s n o w → \"snow\"\n😍o → t o → \"to\"\nsub🐦i😍 → s u b m i t → \"submit\"\n🐶i😍h → w i t h → \"with\"\n😍he → t h e → \"the\"\n😍a🐼🐼🐦ission → t a g g m i s s i o n → \"taggmission\"\n\nSo the full sentence would be: \"Tagg defeated az snow (5: 20) Tagg forced snow to submit with the Taggmission.\"\n\n\"Taggmission\" could be a project name or code name. \"Az\" could be short for Arizona. So \"Tagg defeated Arizona snow...\" → makes sense.\n\nThis seems plausible. So I think 🐼=g and 🐷=z are the correct guesses.\n\nTo solve the Crypto Word Game, we analyze the encoded sentence, known hints, and historical feedback to deduce the remaining emojis. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Known Correct Emojis (from History and Hint):\n- 😍=t (confirmed by all attempts)\n- 😈=f (feedback confirms \"😈\": True)\n- 🐶=w (feedback confirms \"🐶\": True)\n- 🐦=m (feedback confirms \"🐦\": True)\n- 🐸=d (feedback from attempt 2 onward confirms \"🐸\": True)\n\n### Encoded Sentence with Known Substitutions:\nAfter replacing known emojis, the sentence becomes:  \n`ta🐼🐼 defeated a🐷 snow (5: 20) ta🐼🐼 forced snow to submit with the ta🐼🐼mission.`  \n\n### Deducing 🐼:\nThe phrase `ta🐼🐼` (repeated 3 times) and `ta🐼🐼mission` suggest `taXX` (where `XX` is the same letter twice). Historical attempts ruled out `l, s, n, f, c, r` for 🐼. Testing less common letters, `g` fits: `taXX` becomes `tagg` (a plausible name or code name), and `taXXmission` becomes `taggmission` (a coherent term for a mission).\n\n### Deducing 🐷:\nThe phrase `a🐷` (a two-letter word) follows \"defeated\" and precedes \"snow.\" Historical attempts ruled out `n, b, x, k, c, s` for 🐷. Testing `z` (unused and plausible), `a🐷` becomes `az` (short for Arizona), making the phrase \"a Arizona snow\" coherent.\n\n### Final Guesses:\n- 🐼=g (fits `tagg` and `taggmission`)\n- 🐷=z (fits `az` in \"a Arizona snow\")\n\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐼=g,🐸=d,😈=f,🐷=z,🐶=w,🐦=m","Okay, let's try to figure out the emojis here. The encoded sentence is: 😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission.\n\nWe know from the hint and history that 😍=t (correct). The feedback from previous guesses tells us which are correct. Let's list the known correct ones first:\n\nFrom the history:\n- 😍=t (True in all feedbacks)\n- 😈=f (True in all feedbacks)\n- 🐶=w (True in all feedbacks)\n- 🐦=m (True in all feedbacks)\n- 🐸=d (Guess 2 feedback said 🐸=True, and subsequent guesses kept 🐸=d with True, so 🐸=d is correct)\n  \nSo now, the known mappings are:\n😍=t, 😈=f, 🐶=w, 🐦=m, 🐸=d.\n\nNow let's look at the encoded sentence with these substitutions:\n\nOriginal: 😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission.\n\nSubstituting known:\nt a 🐼🐼 d e f e a t e d a 🐷 s n o w (5: 20) t a 🐼🐼 f o r c e d s n o w t o s u b m i t w i t h t h e t a 🐼🐼 m i s s i o n.\n\nLet's parse this step by step. Let's break down parts:\n\nFirst part: \"t a 🐼🐼 d e f e a t e d a 🐷 s n o w\" → \"ta__ defeated a _ snow\"\n\nThen: \"(5: 20)\" maybe a time or page reference, not important for words.\n\nNext: \"t a 🐼🐼 f o r c e d s n o w\" → \"ta__ forced snow\"\n\nThen: \"t o s u b m i t\" → \"to submit\" (since 🐦=m, sub🐦i😍 is subm it → submit, since 😍=t)\n\nThen: \"w i t h\" → \"with\" (🐶=w, so 🐶i😍h is w i t h)\n\nThen: \"t h e\" → \"the\" (😍he is the)\n\nThen: \"t a 🐼🐼 m i s s i o n\" → \"ta__ mission\" (since 🐦=m, 🐼🐼🐦ission is __m ission → __mission. Wait, the last part is 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission → t a 🐼🐼 m i s s i o n → ta__mission. So \"ta__mission\".\n\nLooking at \"ta__ defeated a _ snow\". Let's consider \"ta__\" as a word. Possible words starting with \"ta\": \"tall\", \"tank\", \"task\", \"tact\", \"tarp\", \"tass\", \"tart\", \"tare\", \"tame\", \"take\", \"tape\", \"trap\", \"trip\", \"trim\", \"tram\", \"tray\", \"tree\", \"team\", \"tear\", etc. But it's two letters after \"ta\" (since 🐼 is two emojis, so two letters). So \"taXY\", where XY is the two letters from 🐼 (each 🐼 is the same letter? Wait, the encoded sentence has \"😍a🐼🐼\" which is \"ta🐼🐼\". Since the feedback says 🐼 was guessed as l, s, n, f, c, r, g (all False). So 🐼 is a letter not in those. Let's see.\n\nIn \"ta🐼🐼\", if each 🐼 is the same emoji, then it's \"ta\" followed by two of the same letter. Like \"tall\" (ta + ll), \"trap\" (no, two letters), \"tass\" (ta + ss), \"tatt\" (ta + tt), \"tarp\" (no, not same letters). So maybe \"tall\" (ta + ll). Let's check if that fits elsewhere.\n\nIf 🐼=l, then \"ta🐼🐼\" would be \"tall\". Let's check previous guesses. The first guess had 🐼=l, but feedback was False. So 🐼≠l.\n\nAnother possibility: \"task\" (ta + sk) but two different letters. But the emoji is 🐼🐼, same emoji, so same letter. So \"taXY\" where X=Y (since same emoji). So \"taXX\". So \"tall\" (ll), \"tass\" (ss), \"tatt\" (tt), \"tagg\" (gg), \"tarp\" (no), \"toll\" (no, starts with to), \"tomm\" (no). Let's check other parts.\n\nLooking at \"t a 🐼🐼 f o r c e d s n o w\" → \"ta__ forced snow\". If \"ta__\" is \"tall\", then \"tall forced snow\" → possible. If \"ta__\" is \"tank\", \"tank forced snow\" → maybe.\n\nAnother part: \"t a 🐼🐼 m i s s i o n\" → \"ta__ mission\". So \"ta__mission\". Like \"tallmission\"? No. Maybe \"tact mission\"? No, \"tact\" is 4 letters. \"task mission\"? \"task\" is 4 letters. \"tank mission\"? \"tank\" is 4 letters. \"tarp mission\"? Hmm. Alternatively, \"ta\" could be part of a longer word. Let's look at the first part: \"ta__ defeated a _ snow\". \"defeated a _ snow\" → \"defeated a [something] snow\". Maybe \"defeated a giant snow\"? But the word before \"snow\" is \"sno🐶\" which we know is \"snow\" (since 🐶=w). So \"sno🐶\" is \"snow\".\n\nLooking at \"a🐷\" in \"a🐷 sno🐶\" → \"a _ snow\". So \"a [something] snow\". Maybe \"a heavy snow\"? But \"a🐷\" is \"a\" followed by 🐷. So \"a X snow\". So \"a X snow\" → \"a big snow\", \"a deep snow\", \"a thick snow\", etc. The 🐷 emoji's letter is unknown. Previous guesses for 🐷: n, b, x, k, c, s, z (all False). So 🐷 is another letter.\n\nLooking at \"🐸e😈ea😍e🐸\" which we substituted as \"d e f e a t e d\" → \"defeated\". Oh! Because 🐸=d, so \"d e f e a t e d\" → \"defeated\"! That's perfect. So that part is \"defeated\". So the first part is \"ta__ defeated a _ snow\".\n\nSo \"ta__ defeated a _ snow\". So \"ta__\" is the subject. Maybe \"Team defeated a ... snow\"? No, \"ta__\" is two letters after \"ta\". \"Tank defeated a ... snow\"? \"Tank\" is \"ta\" + \"nk\". But \"ta__\" would be \"ta\" followed by two letters. Let's think: \"ta\" as the start, then two letters. \"Task\" (ta + sk), \"Tall\" (ta + ll), \"Tart\" (ta + rt), \"Tarp\" (ta + rp), \"Tame\" (ta + me), \"Take\" (ta + ke), \"Tape\" (ta + pe), \"Trap\" (ta + rp), \"Trip\" (ta + ri? No, \"trip\" is tri + p).\n\nWait, the first word is \"😍a🐼🐼\" → \"ta🐼🐼\". Let's see if \"ta🐼🐼\" is a word. Let's think of 4-letter words starting with \"ta\":\n\n- \"tall\" (ta + ll)\n- \"tank\" (ta + nk)\n- \"task\" (ta + sk)\n- \"tart\" (ta + rt)\n- \"tarp\" (ta + rp)\n- \"tass\" (ta + ss)\n- \"tats\" (ta + ts)\n- \"tame\" (ta + me)\n- \"take\" (ta + ke)\n- \"tape\" (ta + pe)\n- \"toga\" (no, starts with to)\n- \"tusk\" (no, starts with tu)\n- \"trap\" (ta + rp)\n- \"trim\" (tr + im, no)\n- \"tree\" (tr + ee, no)\n- \"team\" (te + am, no)\n- \"tear\" (te + ar, no)\n  \nSo possible candidates. Now, let's check the part \"ta__ mission\" → \"taXYmission\". If \"taXY\" is \"task\", then \"taskmission\"? No. \"Tank mission\" → \"tankmission\"? Maybe \"tank mission\" (with a space), but the encoded sentence has \"😍a🐼🐼🐦ission\" which is \"taXYm ission\" (since 🐦=m, so \"taXYm\" + \"ission\" → \"taXYmission\". So \"taXYmission\" is one word? Maybe \"tactical mission\"? No. Alternatively, \"taXY\" could be \"tact\" (but that's 4 letters, \"tact\" is t a c t, so \"ta🐼🐼\" would be \"ta\" + \"ct\" (so 🐼=c and 🐼=t? But no, same emoji, so same letter. So 🐼 can't be two different letters. So \"taXY\" must be \"ta\" + two of the same letter (since 🐼 is same emoji, so same letter). So \"taXX\".\n\nSo \"taXX\" → \"tall\" (ll), \"tass\" (ss), \"tatt\" (tt), \"tagg\" (gg), \"tamm\" (mm), \"tarr\" (rr), \"tazz\" (zz). Let's check which of these letters haven't been guessed for 🐼. Previous guesses for 🐼 were l, s, n, f, c, r, g (all wrong). So possible letters not guessed: a, b, d, e, h, i, j, k, m, o, p, q, t, u, v, w, x, y, z.\n\nSo possible options for 🐼 (XX):\n\n- 🐼=a → \"taaa\" → not a word.\n- 🐼=b → \"tabb\" → \"tabb\" isn't a common word.\n- 🐼=d → \"tadd\" → \"tadd\" (maybe a name, not common).\n- 🐼=e → \"taee\" → no.\n- 🐼=h → \"tahh\" → \"tahh\" (like a sound, not a word).\n- 🐼=i → \"taii\" → no.\n- 🐼=j → \"tajj\" → \"taj\" is a thing, but \"tajj\" no.\n- 🐼=k → \"takk\" → maybe a name.\n- 🐼=m → \"tamm\" → \"tamm\" (unlikely).\n- 🐼=o → \"taoo\" → no.\n- 🐼=p → \"tapp\" → \"tapp\" (as in tap, but double p: \"tapp\" could be a variant, but \"tapping\" is more common).\n- 🐼=q → \"taqq\" → no.\n- 🐼=t → \"tatt\" → \"tatt\" (as in tattoo, but \"tatt\" is a short form).\n- 🐼=u → \"ta uu\" → \"ta uu\" no.\n- 🐼=v → \"t avv\" → no.\n- 🐼=w → \"t aww\" → \"ta ww\" → \"taww\" no.\n- 🐼=x → \"t axx\" → \"t axx\" no.\n- 🐼=y → \"t ayy\" → \"t ayy\" no.\n- 🐼=z → \"t azz\" → \"tazz\" (possible as a name).\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"ta__\" is part of a longer word. Let's look at the next part: \"ta__ defeated a _ snow\". \"defeated a _ snow\" → \"defeated a [adjective] snow\". So \"a _ snow\" → \"a heavy snow\", \"a deep snow\", \"a thick snow\", \"a light snow\", etc. The 🐷 is the unknown here, so \"a 🐷 snow\" → \"a X snow\". Previous guesses for 🐷 were n, b, x, k, c, s, z (all wrong). So possible letters for 🐷: a, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, l, m, o, p, q, r, t, u, v, w, y.\n\nLooking at \"a X snow\", possible X: \"heavy\" (but X is one letter, so \"a h snow\" → \"a heavy snow\" would be \"a h snow\"? No, \"heavy\" is 5 letters. So X is a single letter? Wait, \"a🐷\" is \"a\" followed by one letter (since 🐷 is one emoji, so one letter). So \"a X snow\" where X is a single letter. So \"a X snow\" → \"a [adjective starting with X] snow\". For example, \"a big snow\" → X=b (but 🐷=b was guessed and wrong). \"a dry snow\" → X=d. \"a wet snow\" → X=w (but 🐶=w, so maybe not). \"a new snow\" → X=n (guessed wrong). \"a soft snow\" → X=s (guessed wrong). \"a cold snow\" → X=c (guessed wrong). \"a hard snow\" → X=h. \"a light snow\" → X=l (🐼 was guessed as l, but maybe X is h). So possible X=h. So if 🐷=h, then \"a h snow\" → \"a hard snow\". That could work.\n\nNow, let's go back to \"ta__\". Let's assume \"ta__\" is \"tank\" (ta + nk), but then 🐼 would be n and k, but same emoji, so no. Alternatively, \"task\" (ta + sk), but again, different letters. Alternatively, \"tall\" (ta + ll), but 🐼=l was guessed and wrong. \"tass\" (ta + ss), 🐼=s was guessed and wrong. \"tart\" (ta + rt), but different letters. \"tarp\" (ta + rp), different letters. Maybe \"ta\" is not the start, but part of a contraction? Unlikely.\n\nWait, another part: \"😍o sub🐦i😍\" → \"t o sub m i t\" → \"to submit\". That's correct. So \"sub🐦i😍\" is \"subm it\" → \"submit\".\n\nThen \"🐶i😍h\" → \"w i t h\" → \"with\". Correct.\n\n\"😍he\" → \"t h e\" → \"the\". Correct.\n\nNow, \"😈orce🐸\" → \"f o r c e d\" → \"forced\". Because 😈=f, 🐸=d. So \"force d\" → \"forced\". Perfect. That part checks out.\n\nSo \"😈orce🐸\" → \"forced\" (f + orce + d).\n\nSo the part \"😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶\" → \"ta__ forced snow\". So \"ta__ forced snow\" → maybe \"They forced snow\"? No, \"ta__\" is the subject. Maybe \"Tank forced snow\"? \"Task forced snow\"? \"Tall forced snow\"?\n\nAnother angle: \"ta__ defeated a _ snow\" → \"ta__ defeated a _ snow\". \"defeated\" is past tense. So \"ta__\" is a noun, perhaps a name or a thing. Let's think of \"tank\" → \"Tank defeated a ... snow\". \"Tank\" makes sense. But \"ta__\" would need to be \"tank\", which is \"ta\" + \"nk\". But since 🐼 is a single emoji, each 🐼 is the same letter, so \"ta🐼🐼\" would be \"taXX\", where X is the same letter. So \"tank\" would be \"ta\" + \"nk\" (two different letters), which would require two different emojis, but here it's two 🐼, so same letter. So \"taXX\".\n\nSo \"taXX\" must be a 4-letter word. Let's think of \"tall\" (ll), \"tass\" (ss), \"tatt\" (tt), \"tagg\" (gg), \"tamm\" (mm), \"tarr\" (rr), \"tazz\" (zz). Let's check which of these letters are possible. Since previous guesses for 🐼 were l, s, n, f, c, r, g (all wrong), so possible letters for 🐼: a, b, d, e, h, i, j, k, m, o, p, q, t, u, v, w, x, y, z.\n\nLet's try 🐼=k. Then \"ta__\" would be \"takk\". Not a word. 🐼=p → \"tapp\". \"Tapp\" could be a name. 🐼=t → \"tatt\" (as in \"tatt\" is a colloquial term for a tattoo). \"Tatt defeated a ... snow\" → possible. 🐼=b → \"tabb\" → no. 🐼=d → \"tadd\" → maybe a name. 🐼=h → \"tahh\" → no. 🐼=m → \"tamm\" → no. 🐼=o → \"taoo\" → no. 🐼=q → \"taqq\" → no. 🐼=u → \"ta uu\" → no. 🐼=v → \"t avv\" → no. 🐼=w → \"ta ww\" → no. 🐼=x → \"ta xx\" → no. 🐼=y → \"ta yy\" → no. 🐼=z → \"tazz\" → maybe a name.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"ta__\" is \"taco\" (ta + co), but that's two different letters. No. \"Taft\" (ta + ft) → two letters. \"Tail\" (ta + il) → two letters. \"Tain\" (ta + in) → two letters. \"Take\" (ta + ke) → two letters. But all these require two different letters, which would need two different emojis, but here it's two 🐼, so same letter.\n\nHmm. Let's look at the last part: \"😍a🐼🐼🐦ission\" → \"ta__m ission\" → \"ta__mission\". So \"ta__mission\" → maybe \"tactical mission\"? No, \"tactical\" is longer. \"Tact mission\"? No. \"Tank mission\"? \"Tank mission\" would be \"tank mission\", but \"ta__mission\" would be \"taXXmission\". If \"taXX\" is \"task\", then \"taskmission\"? Maybe \"task mission\" (with a space). But the encoded sentence has it as one word? Or maybe \"ta__\" is \"task\" (ta + sk), but sk would require two different emojis. No, since it's two 🐼, same emoji. So \"taXXmission\" → \"tallmission\", \"tassmission\", etc.\n\nAnother thought: \"ta__\" could be \"team\" (te + am), but \"te\" would be \"te\", but the encoded is \"ta\", so \"ta\" is \"ta\". So \"team\" is \"te\" + \"am\", not \"ta\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"ta__\" is part of a hyphenated word, but not likely. Let's think of other parts. The first part: \"ta__ defeated a _ snow (5: 20) ta__ forced snow to submit with the ta__mission.\"\n\nIf \"ta__mission\" is \"tallmission\", but that's not a word. \"Tassmission\"? No. \"Tattmission\"? No. Maybe \"ta__\" is \"task\" and the mission is a task mission. But again, \"task\" is two different letters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"ta__\" is \"the\" + something. No, \"ta\" is \"ta\".\n\nWait, let's check the \"a🐷\" part again. \"a🐷\" → \"a X\". So \"a X snow\". What if \"a X\" is \"a man snow\"? No. \"a van snow\"? No. \"a fan snow\"? \"a fan\" → X=f, but 😈=f, so maybe not. \"a pan snow\"? X=p. \"a can snow\"? X=c (guessed wrong). \"a tan snow\"? X=n (guessed wrong). \"a ran snow\"? X=r (guessed wrong). \"a ban snow\"? X=b (guessed wrong). \"a van snow\"? X=v. \"a fan snow\"? X=f (already used). \"a man snow\"? X=m (🐦=m, so maybe not). \"a fan snow\"? No. \"a hat snow\"? X=h. \"a cat snow\"? X=c (guessed wrong). \"a bat snow\"? X=b (guessed wrong). \"a rat snow\"? X=r (guessed wrong). \"a mat snow\"? X=m (used). \"a sat snow\"? X=s (guessed wrong). \"a vat snow\"? X=v. \"a wat snow\"? X=w (used). \"a yat snow\"? X=y. \"a zat snow\"? X=z (guessed wrong).\n\nSo possible X=h (hat), v (vat), y (yat). Let's say X=h. So \"a h snow\" → \"a hat snow\"? Doesn't make sense. \"a hard snow\" → \"a h snow\" (if X=h). \"a heavy snow\" → \"a h snow\". Maybe. So \"a h snow\" → \"a heavy snow\". That could work. So 🐷=h.\n\nNow, let's think of \"ta__ defeated a h snow\". \"ta__ defeated a heavy snow\". What could \"ta__\" be? \"Tank defeated a heavy snow\"? \"Tank\" is possible. But \"ta__\" would need to be \"tank\", which is \"ta\" + \"nk\". But since 🐼 is two of the same emoji, \"ta__\" would be \"taXX\" (same letter). So \"tank\" is \"ta\" + \"nk\" (different letters), which would need two different emojis, but here it's two 🐼, so same letter. So \"taXX\" must be a 4-letter word with \"ta\" plus two of the same letter.\n\nLet's try \"tall\". If 🐼=l, but that was guessed and wrong. So no. \"Tass\" (ss). 🐼=s was guessed and wrong. \"Tatt\" (tt). 🐼=t. Could that be? Let's check. If 🐼=t, then \"ta__\" is \"tatt\". \"Tatt defeated a heavy snow\". \"Tatt\" could be a name. Let's see if that fits the other parts.\n\n\"ta__mission\" → \"tattmission\". Maybe \"tatt mission\" (with a space). Not great, but possible.\n\nAlternatively, \"ta__\" could be \"tarp\" (ta + rp), but different letters. Not possible. \"Tart\" (ta + rt) → same issue.\n\nAnother angle: the first part is \"😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶\" → \"ta__ defeated a X snow\". \"defeated\" is correct (d e f e a t e d). So \"ta__\" is the subject. Let's think of possible 4-letter nouns starting with \"ta\": \"tank\", \"task\", \"tale\", \"tall\", \"tarp\", \"tart\", \"tass\", \"tatt\", \"toga\" (no), \"tuba\" (no), \"tuna\" (no).\n\nGiven that all previous guesses for 🐼 are wrong, and the letters tried are l, s, n, f, c, r, g, perhaps 🐼=b. Let's try 🐼=b. Then \"ta__\" is \"tabb\". \"Tabb defeated a X snow\". \"Tabb\" could be a surname. Possible.\n\nAlternatively, 🐼=d. \"ta__\" is \"tadd\". \"Tadd defeated a X snow\". Possible as a name.\n\nAlternatively, 🐼=h. \"ta__\" is \"tahh\". Not a word.\n\nAlternatively, 🐼=j. \"tajj\". \"Tajj\" (maybe a variant of Taj).\n\nAlternatively, 🐼=k. \"takk\". Maybe a name.\n\nAlternatively, 🐼=m. \"tamm\". Not a word.\n\nAlternatively, 🐼=p. \"tapp\". \"Tapp\" could be a name.\n\nAlternatively, 🐼=q. \"taqq\". No.\n\nAlternatively, 🐼=t. \"tatt\". Possible.\n\nAlternatively, 🐼=u. \"ta uu\". No.\n\nAlternatively, 🐼=v. \"t avv\". No.\n\nAlternatively, 🐼=w. \"ta ww\". No.\n\nAlternatively, 🐼=x. \"ta xx\". No.\n\nAlternatively, 🐼=y. \"ta yy\". No.\n\nAlternatively, 🐼=z. \"tazz\". Possible.\n\nGiven that, perhaps 🐼=b. Let's try that. Then \"ta__\" is \"tabb\". \"Tabb defeated a X snow\". If X=h (🐷=h), then \"Tabb defeated a heavy snow\".\n\nNow, let's check the other parts. \"ta__ forced snow to submit with the ta__mission.\" → \"tabb forced snow to submit with the tabbmission.\" Not great, but maybe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"ta__\" is \"task\" and the 🐼 is a different approach. Wait, perhaps the emoji 🐼 represents a letter that's part of a plural. For example, \"tall\" (plural of \"tall\" doesn't make sense). \"Tanks\" (but that's plural). No.\n\nAnother thought: \"ta__\" could be \"the\" + \"ll\" → \"thell\"? No. \"ta\" is \"ta\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"ta__\" is a typo or abbreviation. Like \"TA\" (Teaching Assistant) + \"ll\" → \"TAll\". But that's a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the entire sentence structure. The sentence seems to be about forcing snow to submit, with a mission involved. Maybe it's about a team or a task force. \"Task force\" → \"task force\". But \"😈orce🐸\" is \"force d\" → \"forced\". So \"task force\" would be \"task force\", but \"ta__\" would be \"task\".\n\nBut \"task\" is \"t a s k\". So \"😍a🐼🐼\" → \"t a 🐼 🐼\" → \"t a s k\" → so 🐼=s and 🐼=k. But since 🐼 is the same emoji, it has to be the same letter, which can't be. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, \"tank force\" → \"tank force\". \"tank\" is \"t a n k\". So \"😍a🐼🐼\" → \"t a 🐼 🐼\" → \"t a n k\" → 🐼=n and 🐼=k. Again, same emoji, so same letter. Not possible.\n\nAlternatively, \"team\" → \"t e a m\". But \"😍a🐼🐼\" is \"t a 🐼 🐼\" → \"t a ...\". So \"team\" starts with \"te\", not \"ta\".\n\nAnother angle: let's look at the (5:20) part. Maybe it's a time, like 5:20, but not sure.\n\nLet's recap the knowns again:\n\n😍=t, 😈=f, 🐶=w, 🐦=m, 🐸=d.\n\nThe unknowns are 🐼 and 🐷.\n\nLet's list all the places where 🐼 appears:\n\n- 😍a🐼🐼 → ta🐼🐼 (4 letters: t a X X)\n- 😍a🐼🐼 (again) → same as above\n- 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission → taXXm ission → taXXmission (ta + X X + m + ission)\n\nSo \"taXXmission\" → 4 + 1 + 7 = 12 letters? Let's count: \"taXXmission\" → t a X X m i s s i o n → that's 10 letters. \"taXXmission\" → 10 letters. Maybe \"tacticalmission\"? No, that's longer. \"Technicalmission\"? No. \"Tallmission\"? No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"taXX\" is \"tact\" (t a c t), but that's 4 letters, and \"taXX\" would be \"t a X X\", so X would be c and t. But same emoji, so no.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" is \"twin\" → no, starts with tw. \"Twin\" is t w i n.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" is \"trap\" → t a r p. So X would be r and p. But same emoji, so no.\n\nAlternatively, \"taXX\" is \"trip\" → t a r i p. No, 5 letters.\n\nHmm. Let's think of the word \"mission\". The part \"taXXmission\" could be \"tactical mission\", but \"tactical\" is 8 letters. \"taXX\" would need to be \"tact\", but again, same issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"taXX\" is \"task\" and \"task mission\" → \"taskmission\". Not a word, but possible in code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"taXX\" is \"tank\" and \"tank mission\".\n\nBut since we can't get around the fact that 🐼 is the same letter, perhaps we need to consider that \"taXX\" is a less common word. Let's think of \"tass\" → \"tass\" (a type of fabric, or a name). \"Tass defeated a heavy snow. Tass forced snow to submit with the tassmission.\" Possible.\n\nIf 🐼=s, but the second guess had 🐼=s and feedback was False. So 🐼≠s.\n\nAnother possibility: \"tatt\" → \"tatt\" (colloquial for tattoo). \"Tatt defeated a heavy snow. Tatt forced snow to submit with the tattmission.\" Possible. If 🐼=t, then \"taXX\" is \"tatt\". Let's check if 🐼=t was guessed. Previous guesses for 🐼: l, s, n, f, c, r, g. So 🐼=t hasn't been guessed yet. That's possible.\n\nSo let's hypothesize:\n\n🐼=t. Then:\n\n😍a🐼🐼 → t a t t → \"tatt\".\n\nThen, \"tatt defeated a X snow\" → \"tatt defeated a X snow\".\n\n\"tatt forced snow to submit with the tattmission.\" → \"tatt forced snow to submit with the tattmission.\"\n\nNow, what about 🐷? \"a🐷\" → \"a X\". So \"a X snow\" → \"a X snow\". Let's say 🐷=h. So \"a h snow\" → \"a heavy snow\". Then \"tatt defeated a heavy snow\".\n\nDoes that make sense? Maybe. \"Tatt\" could be a code name or a character's name.\n\nNow, let's check if this fits all parts.\n\nEncoded Sentence with these guesses:\n\n😍=t, 🐼=t, 🐸=d, 😈=f, 🐷=h, 🐶=w, 🐦=m.\n\nSubstituting:\n\nt a t t d e f e a t e d a h s n o w (5: 20) t a t t f o r c e d s n o w t o s u b m i t w i t h t h e t a t t m i s s i o n.\n\nWhich reads: \"tatt defeated a h snow (5: 20) tatt forced snow to submit with the tatt mission.\"\n\nThat makes sense. \"h\" could be an abbreviation or part of a word, but \"a h snow\" is a bit odd. Maybe \"a huge snow\"? Then 🐷=u. Let's try 🐷=u.\n\nIf 🐷=u, then \"a u snow\" → \"a huge snow\". \"tatt defeated a huge snow\". That works better. \"Huge\" starts with h, but \"a u\" would be \"a u\" → \"a u snow\" → \"a huge snow\" (if u represents \"uge\"). No, that's not possible. \"a u\" is one letter. So \"a u snow\" → \"a u snow\" → maybe \"a unique snow\"? \"a united snow\"? Not great.\n\nAlternatively, 🐷=b. \"a b snow\" → \"a big snow\". \"tatt defeated a big snow\". That works. \"Big\" starts with b, so \"a b snow\" → \"a big snow\". That's possible. \"a b snow\" → \"a big snow\". So \"b\" would be the letter for 🐷. But in guess 2, 🐷=b was guessed and feedback was False. So 🐷≠b.\n\nGuess 2: 🐷=b → Feedback: False. So 🐷≠b.\n\nGuess 1: 🐷=n → False. Guess 3: 🐷=x → False. Guess 4: 🐷=k → False. Guess 5: 🐷=c → False. Guess 6: 🐷=s → False. Guess 7: 🐷=z → False. So 🐷 is not n, b, x, k, c, s, z. So possible letters: a, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, l, m, o, p, q, r, t, u, v, w, y.\n\nIf 🐷=h (not guessed yet), then \"a h snow\" → \"a hard snow\" or \"a heavy snow\". That's possible.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the guess would be:\n\n😍=t (known), 🐼=t (hypothesized), 🐸=d (known), 😈=f (known), 🐷=h (hypothesized), 🐶=w (known), 🐦=m (known).\n\nTo solve this Crypto Word Game, we analyze the encoded sentence, known mappings from the history, and the structure of the sentence to deduce the remaining emojis. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\n### **Known Mappings (from History):**\n- 😍=t (confirmed in all attempts)\n- 😈=f (confirmed in all attempts)\n- 🐶=w (confirmed in all attempts)\n- 🐦=m (confirmed in all attempts)\n- 🐸=d (confirmed from attempt 2 onwards)\n\n\n### **Analysis of the Encoded Sentence:**\nSubstituting the known mappings into the encoded sentence:  \n`😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission`  \nbecomes:  \n`t a 🐼🐼 d e f e a t e d a 🐷 s n o w (5: 20) t a 🐼🐼 f o r c e d s n o w t o s u b m i t w i t h t h e t a 🐼🐼 m i s s i o n`.  \n\n\n### **Deducing 🐼:**\nThe phrase `t a 🐼🐼` appears multiple times (e.g., \"t a 🐼🐼 defeated a 🐷 snow\" and \"t a 🐼🐼 mission\"). Since 🐼 is a single emoji, it represents the same letter in both positions. Previous guesses for 🐼 (l, s, n, f, c, r, g) were all incorrect. Testing plausible 4-letter words starting with \"ta\" and requiring two identical letters (e.g., \"tall,\" \"tass,\" \"tatt\"), we find \"tatt\" (colloquial for \"tattoo\") fits contextually as a subject in the sentence. Thus, 🐼=t.  \n\n\n### **Deducing 🐷:**\nThe phrase `a 🐷 s n o w` (i.e., \"a 🐷 snow\") requires 🐷 to be a letter forming a plausible adjective for \"snow.\" Previous guesses for 🐷 (n, b, x, k, c, s, z) were incorrect. \"Heavy snow\" is a common phrase, so 🐷=h (since \"h\" is unguessed and fits \"a h snow\" → \"a heavy snow\").  \n\n\n### **Final Mappings:**\n- 😍=t (known)  \n- 🐼=t (deduced)  \n- 🐸=d (known)  \n- 😈=f (known)  \n- 🐷=h (deduced)  \n- 🐶=w (known)  \n- 🐦=m (known)  \n\n\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐼=t,🐸=d,😈=f,🐷=h,🐶=w,🐦=m","Okay, let's try to figure out the correct emojis. First, let's list out what we know from the history and the hint.\n\nThe hint says 😍=t, which is confirmed correct in all attempts. The feedback from previous guesses tells us which emojis are correct. Let's go through each emoji:\n\n- 😍: Confirmed as 't' (all feedbacks have True)\n- 😈: Confirmed as 'f' (all feedbacks have True)\n- 🐶: Confirmed as 'w' (all feedbacks have True)\n- 🐦: Confirmed as 'm' (all feedbacks have True)\n- 🐸: From attempt 1, feedback was False. Attempt 2: feedback True, so 🐸=d (since attempt 2 guessed 🐸=d and got True). All subsequent attempts also have 🐸=d with True, so 🐸=d is correct.\n  \nSo the correct ones so far are 😍=t, 😈=f, 🐶=w, 🐦=m, 🐸=d.\n\nNow, the unknown emojis are 🐼, 🐷. Let's look at the encoded sentence with the known substitutions:\n\nEncoded Sentence (with known emojis replaced):\nt a 🐼🐼 d e f e a t e d a 🐷 s n o w (5: 20) t a 🐼🐼 f o r c e d s n o w t o s u b m i t w i t h t h e t a 🐼🐼 m i s s i o n.\n\nLet's parse this step by step. Let's break down the sentence into parts.\n\nFirst part: \"t a 🐼🐼 d e f e a t e d a 🐷 s n o w\"\n\nBreaking down words:\n- \"t a 🐼🐼\" → \"ta??\" → maybe \"task\" (ta + sk), \"tall\" (ta + ll), \"tank\" (ta + nk), \"tact\" (ta + ct), etc. But let's check the next part.\n- \"d e f e a t e d\" → \"defeated\" (since 🐸=d, so \"d\" is first letter; 😈=f, so \"f\" next. So \"d e f e a t e d\" is \"defeated\". That makes sense. So the structure here is \"ta?? defeated a ??? snow\".\n\nNext: \"a 🐷 s n o w\" → \"a ??? snow\". \"snow\" is known (🐶=w, so \"sno🐶\" is \"snow\"). So \"a [something] snow\". Maybe \"a pile of snow\"? But \"a [single word] snow\" could be \"a block snow\" (unlikely), \"a drift snow\"? Hmm, \"drift\" is a word, but \"a drift snow\" might not be right. Alternatively, \"a bank snow\" (snowbank?), but the structure is \"a [X] snow\".\n\nThen, \"t a 🐼🐼 f o r c e d s n o w\" → \"ta?? forced snow\". \"forced\" is \"f o r c e d\" (since 😈=f, so \"f\", then \"orced\" → \"forced\"). So \"ta?? forced snow\".\n\nNext part: \"t o s u b m i t\" → \"to submit\" (since 🐦=m, so \"sub🐦i\" → \"submit\"). Then \"w i t h\" → \"with\" (🐶=w, so \"🐶i\" → \"wi\"). Then \"t h e\" → \"the\". Then \"t a 🐼🐼 m i s s i o n\" → \"ta?? mission\". So \"ta?? mission\".\n\nPutting it all together, let's look for the \"ta??\" part. Let's see:\n\nIn \"ta?? defeated a ??? snow\", \"ta??\" is likely a noun. Let's check \"ta?? mission\" at the end. \"ta?? mission\" could be \"task mission\", \"tank mission\", \"tact mission\", \"tall mission\" (unlikely). \"Task mission\" makes sense. \"Task\" is a common word. Let's test 🐼=s. Wait, in attempt 2, guess was 🐼=s, feedback was False. So 🐼 can't be s. Attempt 1: 🐼=l, feedback False. Attempt 3: 🐼=n, False. 4: 🐼=f, False. 5: 🐼=c, False. 6: 🐼=r, False. 7: 🐼=g, False. 8: 🐼=t, False (can't be t because 😍=t, and each emoji is unique).\n\nWhat's left? Let's think of 2-letter words that start with 'a' (since \"t a 🐼🐼\" → \"ta\" + two letters. Wait, \"t a 🐼🐼\" → \"t a [two emojis, both 🐼]\". So \"t a 🐼🐼\" is \"t a [🐼][🐼]\" → \"ta\" followed by two of the same letters (since 🐼 is the same emoji). So \"ta\" + \"xx\" where xx is a pair. For example, \"tall\" (ta + ll), \"tank\" (ta + nk) no, \"tact\" (ta + ct) no, \"tusk\" (tu + sk, but here it's 'a' not 'u'), \"taco\" (ta + co), \"tart\" (ta + rt), \"task\" (ta + sk), \"tass\" (ta + ss), \"tads\" (ta + ds), \"tags\" (ta + gs), \"taps\" (ta + ps), \"tars\" (ta + rs), \"tans\" (ta + ns), \"tats\" (ta + ts), \"taws\" (ta + ws), \"togs\" (ta + gs, but 'ta' + 'gs' is 'tags').\n\nLooking at \"ta?? mission\" → \"ta\" + \"xx\" + \" mission\". Let's say \"task mission\" → \"task mission\". Then \"ta??\" would be \"task\" → \"ta\" + \"sk\". So 🐼 would be 's' and 'k'? But no, the emoji is 🐼, which is the same for both letters. So \"ta\" + \"xx\" → \"ta\" + two of the same letters. So \"tall\" (ll), \"tass\" (ss), \"titt\" (tt, but attempt 8 had 🐼=t, which was wrong), \"togs\" (gg, but attempt 7 had 🐼=g, which was wrong). \"Tall\" is \"ta\" + \"ll\" → 🐼=l. But attempt 1 guessed 🐼=l and got feedback False, so that's out. \"Tass\" → \"ta\" + \"ss\" → 🐼=s. Attempt 2 guessed 🐼=s, feedback False. \"Tart\" → \"ta\" + \"rt\" → but same emoji, so rt can't be same. \"Tact\" → \"ta\" + \"ct\" → no. \"Tank\" → \"ta\" + \"nk\" → no. \"Taco\" → \"ta\" + \"co\" → no. \"Tads\" → \"ta\" + \"ds\" → no. \"Tags\" → \"ta\" + \"gs\" → no. \"Taps\" → \"ta\" + \"ps\" → no. \"Tars\" → \"ta\" + \"rs\" → no. \"Tans\" → \"ta\" + \"ns\" → no. \"Tats\" → \"ta\" + \"ts\" → no. \"Taws\" → \"ta\" + \"ws\" → no. \"Togs\" → \"ta\" + \"gs\" → no.\n\nHmm. Let's check another part. The sentence includes \"f o r c e d\" → \"forced\" (correct, since 😈=f). So \"t a 🐼🐼 f o r c e d s n o w\" → \"ta?? forced snow\". So \"ta??\" is the subject. Maybe \"team forced snow\"? \"team\" → \"ta\" + \"em\". But \"em\" would require 🐼=e and m, but 🐦=m is already taken, and emojis are unique. No. \"Tale forced snow\"? \"tale\" → \"ta\" + \"le\". So 🐼=l and e, but 🐸=d, 😈=f, etc. But attempt 1 guessed 🐼=l and got False, so that's out. \"Tape forced snow\"? \"tape\" → \"ta\" + \"pe\". 🐼=p and e? No, same emoji. \"Take\" → \"ta\" + \"ke\". \"Take forced snow\" → \"take forced snow\". That could make sense. \"Take\" is \"ta\" + \"ke\". So two letters, k and e. But again, same emoji. So \"ta\" + \"xx\" where xx is same letters. \"Take\" is \"ta\" + \"ke\", not same. \"Tame\" → \"ta\" + \"me\". \"Me\" is m and e. 🐦=m, so m is taken, but \"me\" would need two different letters, but 🐼 is same. So not.\n\nAnother angle: \"sno🐶\" is \"snow\" (since 🐶=w). So \"sno\" + \"w\" → correct. \"sub🐦i\" → \"sub\" + \"m\" + \"i\" → \"submit\" (since 🐦=m). That works. \"🐶i😍h\" → \"w\" + \"i\" + \"t\" + \"h\" → \"with\". Correct. \"😍he\" → \"t\" + \"h\" + \"e\" → \"the\". Correct. \"😍a🐼🐼🐦ission\" → \"t\" + \"a\" + \"🐼\" + \"🐼\" + \"m\" + \"ission\" → \"ta\" + \"xx\" + \"mission\". So \"ta\" + \"xx\" + \"mission\" → \"taskmission\"? No, \"ta\" + \"xx\" + \"mission\" → \"tallmission\"? No, \"ta\" + \"xx\" + \"mission\" → \"tassmission\"? Maybe \"tass\" is part of \"mass\" → \"tass mission\" → \"mass mission\"? Not sure.\n\nLet's look at the first part: \"t a 🐼🐼 d e f e a t e d a 🐷 s n o w\" → \"ta?? defeated a ??? snow\". \"defeated a ??? snow\" → \"defeated a [something] snow\". Maybe \"defeated a pile of snow\"? But \"a pile\" would be \"a pile\", so \"a 🐷\" → \"a p...\" So \"a p...\" → \"a pile\" (but \"a pile\" is two words, \"a\" and \"pile\"). Alternatively, \"defeated a block snow\" → \"block\" → \"a block\". So \"a 🐷\" → \"a block\" → \"a b...\". But \"block\" is 5 letters, but \"a 🐷\" is \"a\" + \"🐷\", which is one word (since \"a\" is separate). So \"a [single word] snow\" → \"a drift snow\" (drift is a noun). \"drift\" → \"dri...\", but \"a drift\" → \"a d...\", so \"a 🐷\" would be \"a d...\" but \"drift\" is 5 letters. \"a drift\" is \"a d r i f t\", but here \"a 🐷\" is \"a\" + \"🐷\", so \"🐷\" would be \"drift\"? No, because \"a 🐷\" is \"a\" followed by one emoji, so \"🐷\" is a single letter. Wait, no: the encoded sentence has \"a🐷 sno🐶\" → \"a\" + \"🐷\" + \" sno\" + \"w\". So \"a🐷\" is \"a\" + [emoji 🐷] → \"a\" + [one letter], making a two-letter word: \"a\" + [X] → \"aX\". So \"aX\" + \" snow\". For example, \"aX snow\" → \"aX snow\". Possible two-letter words starting with 'a': \"an\", \"as\", \"at\", \"am\", \"ax\", \"ay\", \"aw\". Let's check:\n\nIf \"a🐷\" is \"an\" → \"an snow\" (unlikely). \"as snow\" → \"as snow\" (maybe \"as in the snow\"). \"at snow\" (unlikely). \"am snow\" (no). \"ax snow\" (no). \"ay snow\" (no). \"aw snow\" (no). So maybe \"aX\" is \"ab\", \"ac\", etc. But \"aX\" as a word. \"ab\" is a word (abdominal muscle), \"ad\" (advertisement), \"ae\" (rare), \"af\" (no), \"ag\" (ag is silver), \"ah\" (exclamation), \"ai\" (type of sloth), \"ak\" (no), \"al\" (al is salt), \"ao\" (no), \"ap\" (no), \"aq\" (no), \"ar\" (are), \"as\", \"at\", \"au\" (gold), \"av\" (no), \"aw\", \"ax\", \"ay\", \"az\" (Arizona). \n\nLooking at \"defeated a [aX] snow\" → \"defeated a [something] snow\". \"defeated a ad snow\" (no). \"defeated a ah snow\" (no). \"defeated a ar snow\" (no). \"defeated a as snow\" → \"defeated as snow\" (maybe, but \"as\" is a preposition). \"defeated a at snow\" (no). \"defeated a ax snow\" (no). \"defeated a ay snow\" (no). \"defeated a az snow\" (no).\n\nAlternatively, \"a🐷\" could be part of a longer word. Wait, the structure is \"a🐷 sno🐶\" → \"a🐷 snow\". So \"a🐷\" is a word before \"snow\". Maybe \"a blizzard snow\" but \"blizzard\" is longer. Alternatively, maybe \"a pile of snow\" → but \"a pile\" would be \"a p...\" and \"of\" is missing. Hmm.\n\nLet's go back to the \"ta??\" part. The full sentence after substitution (with knowns) is:\n\nt a 🐼🐼 d e f e a t e d a 🐷 s n o w (5: 20) t a 🐼🐼 f o r c e d s n o w t o s u b m i t w i t h t h e t a 🐼🐼 m i s s i o n.\n\nBreaking into words (spaces as per original):\n\n1. 😍a🐼🐼 → t a 🐼🐼 → \"ta??\"\n2. 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 → d e f e a t e d → \"defeated\"\n3. a🐷 → a 🐷 → \"a?\"\n4. sno🐶 → sno w → \"snow\"\n5. (5: 20) → probably a timestamp, not relevant.\n6. 😍a🐼🐼 → t a 🐼🐼 → \"ta??\"\n7. 😈orce🐸 → f o r c e d → \"forced\"\n8. sno🐶 → snow\n9. 😍o → t o → \"to\"\n10. sub🐦i😍 → sub m i t → \"submit\"\n11. 🐶i😍h → w i t h → \"with\"\n12. 😍he → t h e → \"the\"\n13. 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission → t a 🐼🐼 m i s s i o n → \"ta?? mission\"\n\nSo the sentence structure is:\n\n\"ta?? defeated a? snow (5:20) ta?? forced snow to submit with the ta?? mission.\"\n\nThat makes sense. \"ta??\" is a noun repeated. Let's think of a noun that fits here. \"Task\" → \"ta\" + \"sk\". But \"sk\" would require two different letters, but 🐼 is the same emoji, so \"ta\" + \"xx\" (two same letters). So \"tall\" (ta + ll) → \"tall\". Let's check \"tall defeated a? snow... tall forced snow to submit with the tall mission.\" That could make sense. \"Tall\" as in a tall structure. But attempt 1 guessed 🐼=l, feedback was False, so that's out.\n\nAnother possibility: \"tank\" → \"ta\" + \"nk\", but different letters. \"Tact\" → \"ta\" + \"ct\". \"Tart\" → \"ta\" + \"rt\". \"Tass\" → \"ta\" + \"ss\" → \"tass\". If \"tass\" is a word (Tass is a news agency, but lowercase \"tass\" could be a plural of \"tas\", but not common). \"Tass mission\" → maybe. But attempt 2 guessed 🐼=s, feedback False, so \"ss\" (🐼=s) is out.\n\nWhat about \"tads\"? \"ta\" + \"ds\" → \"tads\" (plural of tad). \"Tads defeated a? snow... tads forced snow...\" Maybe. But \"tads\" is a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, \"tags\" → \"ta\" + \"gs\". \"Tags defeated a? snow... tags forced snow...\" Unlikely.\n\nAnother angle: the \"ta?? mission\" part. \"ta?? mission\" → \"task mission\" (but \"task\" is \"ta\" + \"sk\"). If \"ta??\" is \"task\", then 🐼 would be 's' and 'k', but since 🐼 is a single emoji, it's the same character. So \"task\" would need two different emojis, but here it's two 🐼s, so the letters must be the same. So \"task\" can't be. So \"ta??\" must be a two-same-letter ending. Like \"tall\", \"tass\", \"titt\", \"toot\", etc. But \"titt\" would have 🐼=t, which was attempted (attempt 8: 🐼=t, feedback False). \"Toot\" → \"ta\" + \"oo\" → no, starts with 'ta' not 'to'.\n\nLet's check the \"🐷\" emoji. The word \"a🐷\" is \"a\" + [🐷]. Let's look at previous guesses for 🐷. Attempt 1: 🐷=n → feedback False. Attempt 2: 🐷=b → False. 3: 🐷=x → False. 4: 🐷=k → False. 5: 🐷=c → False. 6: 🐷=s → False. 7: 🐷=z → False. 8: 🐷=h → False. So possible letters not guessed yet for 🐷: a, d, e, g, i, j, l, m (but m is 🐦), o, p, q, r (r was guessed for 🐼, but maybe), u, v, w (w is 🐶), y.\n\nLooking at \"a🐷\" → \"a\" + [🐷] → possible two-letter words. Let's say \"a🐷\" is \"ap\" → \"ap\" (abbreviation for apartment, or a type of bee). \"a ap snow\" → no. \"a aq\" → no. \"a ar\" → \"ar\" (are). \"a ar snow\" → \"a are snow\" → no. \"a as\" → \"a as snow\" → \"a as snow\" (maybe \"as\" as a preposition). \"a at\" → \"a at snow\" → no. \"a aw\" → \"a aw snow\" → no. \"a ax\" → \"a ax snow\" → no. \"a ay\" → no. \"a az\" → no. \n\nAlternatively, \"a🐷\" could be part of a longer word, but the structure is \"a🐷 sno🐶\" → \"a🐷 snow\". Maybe \"a🐷\" is \"bank\" → \"a bank snow\" (snowbank). But \"bank\" is 4 letters, and \"a🐷\" is \"a\" + \"🐷\", so \"🐷\" would be \"bank\" → no, each emoji is a single letter. So \"a🐷\" is \"a\" + [one letter], making a two-letter word.\n\nAnother thought: \"defeated a [X] snow\" → \"defeated a wall snow\" → \"wall\" → \"a w...\" but \"a w\" → \"aw\", which is a word. \"defeated a aw snow\" → no. \"defeated a hill snow\" → \"hill\" → \"a h...\" → \"ah\" → \"a ah snow\" → no. \n\nLet's try to find \"ta??\" in \"ta?? mission\". If \"ta?? mission\" is \"tact mission\" → \"tact\" → \"ta\" + \"ct\". So 🐼 would be 'c' and 't'. But 🐼 is the same emoji, so 'c' and 't' would have to be the same, which they're not. Attempt 5 guessed 🐼=c, feedback False. So that's out.\n\nWhat if \"ta??\" is \"trap\"? \"ta\" + \"rp\" → no. \"Tram\" → \"ta\" + \"rm\" → no. \"Tran\" → \"ta\" + \"rn\" → no. \"Tran\" is \"tr\" + \"an\", not \"ta\".\n\nAlternatively, \"ta??\" could be \"tale\" → \"ta\" + \"le\". So 🐼=l and e. But attempt 1 guessed 🐼=l, feedback False. So no.\n\nLet's consider that \"ta??\" might be \"task\" even though the letters are different. Wait, the encoded sentence has \"😍a🐼🐼\" → \"t a 🐼🐼\" → \"ta\" followed by two 🐼 emojis. So if 🐼=s, then \"ta🐼🐼\" → \"tass\". But attempt 2 guessed 🐼=s, feedback was False. So \"tass\" is out.\n\nAnother angle: let's check the frequency of 🐼. How many times does 🐼 appear? Let's count:\n\nEncoded Sentence: 😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission.\n\nLooking for 🐼: \n\n😍a🐼🐼 → 2 🐼s\n\n😍a🐼🐼 → 2 🐼s\n\n😍a🐼🐼🐦ission → 2 🐼s\n\nTotal of 6 🐼s. So 🐼 is a common character, likely a vowel or a common consonant like 's', 'n', 'r', 't', etc. But 't' is taken by 😍, 's' was guessed (attempt 2) and wrong. 'n' was guessed (attempt 3) and wrong. 'r' (attempt 6) wrong. 'l' (attempt 1) wrong. 'f' (attempt 4) wrong. 'c' (attempt 5) wrong. 'g' (attempt 7) wrong. 't' (attempt 8) wrong. So remaining common letters: 'o', 'i', 'u', 'd' (but 🐸=d), 'h', 'b', 'k', 'p', 'v', 'w' (taken), 'm' (taken), 'y', 'q', 'x', 'z'.\n\nLet's try 'o'. If 🐼=o, then \"ta🐼🐼\" → \"taoo\" → \"taoo\". That doesn't make sense. \"taoo mission\" → no.\n\n'i' → \"taii\" → \"taii\". No.\n\n'u' → \"ta uu\" → \"ta uu\". No.\n\n'h' → \"tahh\" → \"tahh\". Maybe \"tahh\" as a name, but not common.\n\n'b' → \"tab b\" → \"tabb\" (as in \"tabb\" which is a surname). \"tabb mission\" → possible.\n\n'k' → \"takk\" (Norwegian for thanks), but not common.\n\n'p' → \"tapp\" (as in \"tapp\" for tap, but plural). \"tapp mission\" → possible.\n\n'v' → \"tavv\" → no.\n\n'y' → \"tayy\" → no.\n\n'q' → \"taqq\" → no.\n\n'x' → \"taxx\" → no.\n\n'z' → \"tazz\" → no.\n\nHmm. Maybe \"ta??\" is \"tact\" → \"ta\" + \"ct\", but that's two different letters, but 🐼 is same emoji. So \"tact\" would need two different emojis, but here it's two 🐼s. So that's not possible.\n\nLet's try to look at the \"🐷\" again. The previous guesses for 🐷 were n, b, x, k, c, s, z, h. All wrong. What's left? Let's list letters not used yet (excluding known emojis):\n\nKnown emojis: 😍=t, 😈=f, 🐶=w, 🐦=m, 🐸=d. So used letters: t, f, w, m, d.\n\nOther letters: a, b, c, e, g, h, i, j, k, l, n, o, p, q, r, s, u, v, x, y, z.\n\n🐷 has been guessed as n (attempt 1), b (2), x (3), k (4), c (5), s (6), z (7), h (8). So remaining letters for 🐷: a, e, g, i, j, l, o, p, q, r, u, v, y.\n\nPossible two-letter words \"a🐷\":\n\na + e → \"ae\" (rare, as in aeolian)\na + g → \"ag\" (silver)\na + i → \"ai\" (type of sloth)\na + j → \"aj\" (no)\na + l → \"al\" (salt)\na + o → \"ao\" (no)\na + p → \"ap\" (apartment)\na + q → \"aq\" (no)\na + r → \"ar\" (are)\na + u → \"au\" (gold)\na + v → \"av\" (no)\na + y → \"ay\" (yes)\n\nSo \"a🐷\" could be \"ag\", \"ai\", \"al\", \"ap\", \"ar\", \"au\", \"ay\".\n\nLet's try \"a🐷\" = \"al\" (al is a prefix, like in \"algebra\"). So \"a🐷\" = \"al\" → \"al snow\". \"defeated a al snow\" → \"defeated a al snow\" (maybe \"al\" as a name). \n\nAlternatively, \"a🐷\" = \"ap\" → \"ap snow\" → \"apartment snow\"? No. \"a🐷\" = \"ar\" → \"ar snow\" → \"are snow\"? No. \"a🐷\" = \"au\" → \"au snow\" → \"gold snow\"? No. \"a🐷\" = \"ay\" → \"ay snow\" → \"yes snow\"? No. \"a🐷\" = \"ag\" → \"ag snow\" → \"silver snow\"? No. \"a🐷\" = \"ai\" → \"ai snow\" → \"sloth snow\"? No.\n\nAlternatively, \"a🐷\" could be \"an\" → \"an\" (but 'n' was guessed for 🐷 in attempt 1, feedback False). \"a🐷\" = \"as\" → \"as\" (but 's' was guessed for 🐷 in attempt 6, feedback False). \"a🐷\" = \"at\" → \"at\" (but 't' is taken by 😍).\n\nThis is getting tricky. Let's think of the \"ta?? mission\" again. If \"ta?? mission\" is \"task mission\", then \"task\" would need 🐼=s and k, but since it's two 🐼s, that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe \"ta??\" is \"team\" → \"te\" + \"am\", but the first part is \"t a 🐼🐼\" → \"ta\" + \"xx\", not \"te\".\n\nAnother thought: the original encoded sentence has \"🐸e😈ea😍e🐸\" → \"d e f e a t e d\" → \"defeated\". Let's confirm that: 🐸=d, 😈=f, 😍=t. So \"d e f e a t e d\" → \"defeated\". Correct. So that part is correct.\n\nThe next part: \"a🐷 sno🐶\" → \"a🐷 snow\". Let's assume \"a🐷\" is \"a bank\" → but \"bank\" is 4 letters, so \"a🐷\" would be \"a\" + \"b\" → \"ab\", but \"ab snow\" → no. Alternatively, \"a pile\" → \"a p\" → \"ap\", which we considered.\n\nLet's try to think of \"ta??\" as \"tank\". \"ta\" + \"nk\" → \"tank\". So \"tank defeated a? snow... tank forced snow to submit with the tank mission.\" That makes sense. \"Tank mission\" is a possible phrase. So \"tank\" would require 🐼=n and k. But 🐼 is the same emoji, so \"n\" and \"k\" would have to be the same, which they're not. Attempt 3 guessed 🐼=n, feedback False. So \"n\" is out.\n\nAlternatively, \"ta??\" could be \"tact\" → \"ta\" + \"ct\". \"Tact mission\" → \"tact mission\". Makes sense. \"tact\" would require 🐼=c and t. But \"t\" is taken by 😍, and attempt 5 guessed 🐼=c, feedback False. So no.\n\nLet's try \"ta??\" as \"tart\". \"ta\" + \"rt\" → \"tart\". \"Tart mission\" → possible. \"tart\" would require 🐼=r and t. Attempt 6 guessed 🐼=r, feedback False. So \"r\" is out.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's look at the \"🐼\" frequency again. It appears 6 times. The hint said that the most frequent emoji's letter is revealed, but in this case, the hint was 😍=t. Maybe 😍 is the most frequent emoji. Let's count:\n\n😍 appears in: 😍a🐼🐼, 😈ea😍e🐸, 😍a🐼🐼, 😍o, sub🐦i😍, 🐶i😍h, 😍he, 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission. Let's count:\n\n1. 😍a🐼🐼 → 1\n2. 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 → 1 (😍e)\n3. a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) → no\n4. 😍a🐼🐼 → 1\n5. 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 → no\n6. 😍o → 1\n7. sub🐦i😍 → 1 (i😍)\n8. 🐶i😍h → 1 (i😍h)\n9. 😍he → 1\n10. 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission → 1\n\nTotal 😍: 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1=8 times. That's the most frequent. So the hint was correct (most frequent is 😍=t).\n\n🐼 appears 6 times (as before), 🐸=d (from feedback) appears in 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸, 😈orce🐸 → 2 times. 😈=f appears in 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸, 😈orce🐸 → 2 times. 🐷: once. 🐶=w: in sno🐶, 🐶i😍h → 2 times. 🐦=m: in sub🐦i😍, 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission → 2 times.\n\nSo 🐼 is the second most frequent, appearing 6 times. Common letters are e, t, a, o, i, n, s, h, r, d, l, c, u, m, w, f, g, y, p, b, v, k, j, x, q, z. Since 't' is taken, 'e' is a common vowel. Let's check if 🐼=e. If 🐼=e, then \"ta🐼🐼\" → \"taee\" → \"taee\". That doesn't make sense. \"taee mission\" → no. \"e\" is a vowel, but \"taee\" is not a word.\n\nAnother common vowel: 'a' (but 'a' is already in the sentence as a letter). 'o' → \"taoo\" → no. 'i' → \"ta ii\" → \"ta ii\" → no. 'u' → \"ta uu\" → no.\n\nCommon consonants: 's' (tried), 'n' (tried), 'r' (tried), 'l' (tried), 'c' (tried), 'd' (taken), 'h' (tried for 🐷), 'g' (tried), 'b' (tried for 🐷), 'k' (tried for 🐷), 'p' (not tried), 'm' (taken), 'w' (taken), 'f' (taken), 'v' (not tried), 'y' (not tried), 'x' (tried for 🐷), 'q' (not tried), 'z' (tried for 🐷).\n\nLet's try 🐼=p. Then \"ta🐼🐼\" → \"ta pp\" → \"tapp\". \"Tapp mission\" → possible. \"tapp\" could be a name or a short form. Let's see if that fits. \"tapp defeated a? snow... tapp forced snow to submit with the tapp mission.\" That could work. \n\nNow, 🐷: what's left? If 🐼=p, then \"a🐷\" could be \"ap\" → \"ap\" (apartment). \"a ap snow\" → \"a apartment snow\" → no. Alternatively, \"a🐷\" = \"an\" (but 'n' was tried for 🐷). \"a🐷\" = \"as\" (s tried). \"a🐷\" = \"at\" (t taken). \"a🐷\" = \"am\" (m taken). \"a🐷\" = \"ax\" (x tried). \"a🐷\" = \"ay\" (y not tried). So if 🐷=y, then \"a🐷\" = \"ay\" → \"ay snow\" → \"ay\" is a yes, but \"ay snow\" doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, \"a🐷\" = \"aw\" → \"aw\" (exclamation). \"a aw snow\" → \"a aw snow\" → no.\n\nAnother approach: the sentence is likely about a mission involving snow, perhaps a military or rescue mission. \"ta?? mission\" could be \"tactical mission\" but that's longer. \"Tactical\" is 8 letters, but \"ta??\" is 4 letters. \"Task force\" is a common term. Oh! Wait, \"task force\" → \"task force\". Let's check the part \"😈orce🐸\" → \"f orce d\" → \"forced\". So \"task force\" → \"ta sk f orce\". But \"ta sk\" would be \"ta🐼🐼\" if 🐼=s and k. But 🐼 is the same emoji, so \"ta🐼🐼\" would be \"ta ss\" (if 🐼=s) → \"tass force\". But \"tass\" is not \"task\". Alternatively, maybe \"task\" is \"ta🐼🐼\" with 🐼=s and k, but since they're the same emoji, that's not possible. So maybe \"ta??\" is \"task\" but with a different structure.\n\nAlternatively, \"ta??\" could be \"team\". \"team defeated a? snow... team forced snow to submit with the team mission.\" That makes sense. \"team\" is \"te am\", but the encoded part is \"t a 🐼🐼\" → \"ta\" + \"xx\". So \"ta\" + \"xx\" can't be \"team\".\n\nWait, \"t a 🐼🐼\" → \"t a [🐼][🐼]\" → \"t a\" followed by two of the same letter. So \"ta\" is a separate word? Like \"Ta ll\" (with a space). But the encoded sentence has \"😍a🐼🐼\" → no space between 😍, a, and 🐼🐼. So it's one word: \"ta\" + \"xx\".\n\nAnother possibility: \"ta\" is part of a larger word. Like \"tactical\" → \"tac tical\", but \"ta🐼🐼\" is 4 letters. \"Tact\" is 4 letters: \"t a c t\". So \"ta🐼🐼\" → \"t a c t\" → \"tact\". So 🐼=c and t. But \"t\" is taken by 😍, and attempt 5 guessed 🐼=c, feedback False. So no.\n\nI'm stuck. Let's try to make a guess. Since all previous guesses for 🐼 were wrong, maybe 🐼=b. Let's try 🐼=b. Then \"ta🐼🐼\" → \"ta bb\" → \"tabb\". \"Tabb mission\" → possible. Then, \"a🐷\" could be \"ab\" → \"ab snow\" → \"ab\" is a word (abdominal muscle). \"defeated a ab snow... tabb forced snow to submit with the tabb mission.\" Not great, but possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 🐼=y. \"ta yy\" → \"tayy\" → no. \n\nAlternatively, 🐼=v. \"ta vv\" → \"t avv\" → no.\n\nAlternatively, 🐼=j. \"ta jj\" → \"tajj\" → no.\n\nAlternatively, 🐼=q. \"ta qq\" → \"taqq\" → no.\n\nI think I need to make a guess. Let's assume that 🐼=b (since it's a common consonant not tried yet). And for 🐷, let's guess 'p' (since it's a common letter not tried). So:\n\nGuess: 😍=t,🐼=b,🐸=d,😈=f,🐷=p,🐶=w,🐦=m.\n\nLet's check if this makes sense. \"ta🐼🐼\" → \"ta bb\" → \"tabb\". \"tabb defeated a p snow... tabb forced snow to submit with the tabb mission.\" It's a stretch, but maybe. Alternatively, maybe 🐼=h. \"ta hh\" → \"tahh\". \"tahh mission\" → possible.\n\nBut given the time I've spent, I'll go with 🐼=b and 🐷=p.\n\nTo solve this Crypto Word Game, we analyze the provided encoded sentence, hint, and feedback from previous attempts. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Known Correct Emojis (from feedback):\n- 😍=t (confirmed by all attempts)\n- 😈=f (confirmed by all attempts)\n- 🐶=w (confirmed by all attempts)\n- 🐦=m (confirmed by all attempts)\n- 🐸=d (confirmed from attempt 2 onwards)\n\n### Unknown Emojis: 🐼, 🐷\nWe need to determine the letters for these emojis based on the encoded sentence structure and context.\n\n### Analysis of Encoded Sentence with Known Emojis:\nThe encoded sentence, with known emojis replaced, becomes:  \n`t a 🐼🐼 d e f e a t e d a 🐷 s n o w (5: 20) t a 🐼🐼 f o r c e d s n o w t o s u b m i t w i t h t h e t a 🐼🐼 m i s s i o n.`  \n\nKey observations:  \n- The phrase `t a 🐼🐼` repeats multiple times, suggesting it is a critical noun (e.g., \"task,\" \"team,\" \"tact\").  \n- `d e f e a t e d` (defeated) and `f o r c e d` (forced) confirm the context involves action against snow.  \n- `t a 🐼🐼 m i s s i o n` (ta?? mission) implies the repeated noun is part of a mission.  \n\n### Deductions for 🐼:\nPrevious attempts ruled out 🐼=l, s, n, f, c, r, g, t. The remaining common consonants include `b, p, v, y`. Given the repetition and context, `b` is a plausible candidate (e.g., \"tabb mission\" as a specific mission name).  \n\n### Deductions for 🐷:\nPrevious attempts ruled out 🐷=n, b, x, k, c, s, z, h. The remaining common letters include `p, v, y`. Given the phrase `a 🐷 s n o w` (a?? snow), `p` fits (e.g., \"a p snow\" as a brief reference to a \"pile\" or \"patch\" of snow).  \n\n### Final Guess:\nBased on the above, the most plausible letters for the unknown emojis are 🐼=b and 🐷=p.  \n\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐼=b,🐸=d,😈=f,🐷=p,🐶=w,🐦=m","Okay, let's try to figure out the correct emojis here. The encoded sentence is: 😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission.\n\nWe know from the hint that 😍=t. Let's list out what's already confirmed from the history. \n\nLooking at the feedbacks:\n\n- 😍=t is correct (all feedbacks have True for 😍)\n- 😈=f is correct (all feedbacks have True for 😈)\n- 🐶=w is correct (all feedbacks have True for 🐶)\n- 🐦=m is correct (all feedbacks have True for 🐦)\n- 🐸=d is correct (from attempt 2 onwards, feedback for 🐸 is True)\n- The other emojis (🐼, 🐷) are still incorrect in all previous guesses.\n\nLet's start decoding parts of the sentence with the known values.\n\nFirst, replace the known emojis:\n\nEncoded sentence becomes: t a 🐼🐼 d e f e a t e d a 🐷 s n o w (5: 20) t a 🐼🐼 f o r c e d s n o w t o s u b m i t w i t h t h e t a 🐼🐼 m i s s i o n.\n\nLet's parse this step by step. Let's look at the first part: \"t a 🐼🐼 d e f e a t e d\" — that's \"ta[🐼][🐼] defeated\". The structure here is \"taXX defeated\". Maybe \"taXX\" is a word. Let's see. \"ta\" could be the start of \"task\", \"tank\", \"tall\", \"tarp\", \"tack\", \"tale\", etc. The next part is \"a 🐷 sno w\" — \"a [🐷] snow\". So \"a [X] snow\" — possible words: \"a new snow\" (but 🐷 would be 'n'? But in attempt 1, 🐷 was guessed as 'n' and feedback was False. So that's out. \"a fresh snow\"? Maybe. \"a thick snow\"? \"a heavy snow\"? \"a light snow\"? Let's check other parts.\n\nNext, \"(5: 20)\" — maybe a time or page reference, not sure. Then \"t a 🐼🐼 f o r c e d sno w\" — \"taXX forced snow\". So \"taXX forced snow\". Then \"t o sub m i t\" — \"to submit\". Then \"w i t h\" — \"with\". \"t h e\" — \"the\". \"t a 🐼🐼 m i s s i o n\" — \"taXX mission\". So \"taXX mission\".\n\nSo \"taXX mission\" — possible words: \"tactical mission\", \"tanker mission\", \"tally mission\", \"tango mission\", \"tamar mission\" (unlikely), \"tank mission\", \"task mission\" (maybe \"task mission\"?). Let's check \"taXX mission\". If \"taXX\" is \"task\", then \"task mission\" makes sense. \"Task mission\" — but \"task\" is 4 letters. \"taXX\" is \"ta\" + two letters. So \"ta\" + \"sk\" would make \"task\". So 🐼🐼 would be \"sk\". So each 🐼 is a letter. Let's check the first part: \"ta🐼🐼 defeated\" — \"task defeated\"? \"Task defeated\" could make sense. Let's check the first part again: \"t a 🐼🐼 d e f e a t e d\" — \"t a sk d e f e a t e d\" — \"task defeated\". That fits. So maybe 🐼=s and 🐼=k? Wait, but emojis are unique. Each emoji represents a unique letter. So 🐼 is a single emoji, so it's a single letter. So \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"ta\" + two of the same emoji, which would be \"taLL\", \"taSS\", \"taNN\", etc. Because the emoji is the same, so the two letters are the same. Oh! Right, because the encoded sentence has \"😍a🐼🐼\" — that's \"t a 🐼🐼\", so \"t a\" followed by two of the same emoji. So that's \"ta\" + two of the same letter. So \"taLL\" (tall), \"taSS\" (tass), \"taNN\" (tann), \"taPP\" (tapp), \"taDD\" (tadd), \"taGG\" (tagg), etc. \n\nLooking at the part \"t a 🐼🐼 m i s s i o n\" — \"taXX mission\". If \"taXX\" is \"tall\", then \"tall mission\" — possible. \"tass mission\" — \"tass\" is a news agency, maybe not. \"tank mission\" would be \"taNK\" but that's two different letters. So \"taXX\" must be a word with two identical letters. Let's check the first part again: \"taXX defeated\" — \"tall defeated\"? \"tall\" as in a person? Maybe. \"tass defeated\" — less likely. \"tann\" (as in tannin) — not. \"tapp\" — no. \"tadd\" — no. \"tagg\" — no. What about \"task\"? No, because \"task\" is t-a-s-k, which would need two different emojis. But here it's two of the same emoji. So \"taXX\" must have two same letters.\n\nAnother part: \"t a 🐼🐼 f o r c e d sno w\" — \"taXX forced snow\". \"Tall forced snow\" — maybe. \"Tall\" as in a tall structure? \"Tall forced snow\" — maybe not. Let's look at the part \"the taXX mission\". If \"taXX mission\" is \"tactical mission\" — no, because \"tactical\" is longer. \"Tact mission\"? \"Tact\" is t-a-c-t. Again, two different letters. So \"taXX\" is two same letters.\n\nLet's check the word \"subm i t\" — \"submit\". That's correct with 🐦=m (sub🐦i😍 → sub m i t). Good.\n\nThe part \"w i t h\" — \"with\" (🐶i😍h → w i t h). Correct.\n\nThe part \"t h e\" — \"the\" (😍he → t h e). Correct.\n\nNow, the word \"sno🐶\" — \"snow\" (since 🐶=w). Correct.\n\nThe part \"f o r c e d\" — \"forced\" (😈orce🐸 → f o r c e d). Correct, since 😈=f and 🐸=d.\n\nThe part \"a 🐷 sno w\" — \"a [🐷] snow\". Let's think of possible adjectives here. \"a new snow\" — but 🐷 was guessed as 'n' (attempt 1) and feedback was False, so 🐷≠n. \"a fresh snow\" — \"fresh\" starts with f, but 😈=f, so no. \"a light snow\" — \"light\" starts with l. \"a heavy snow\" — h. \"a thick snow\" — t. \"a soft snow\" — s. \"a hard snow\" — h. Let's check the previous guesses for 🐷. Attempt 1: 🐷=n (False). Attempt 2: 🐷=b (False). Attempt 3: 🐷=x (False). Attempt 4: 🐷=k (False). Attempt 5: 🐷=c (False). Attempt 6: 🐷=s (False). Attempt 7: 🐷=z (False). Attempt 8: 🐷=h (False). Attempt 9: 🐷=p (False). So all these letters are wrong for 🐷. Possible letters left (since letters are unique and we have to use a-z, excluding t, f, w, m, d (from 😍, 😈, 🐶, 🐦, 🐸). Let's list used letters: t (😍), f (😈), w (🐶), m (🐦), d (🐸). So remaining letters: a, b, c, e, g, h, i, j, k, l, n, o, p, q, r, s, u, v, x, y, z. But 🐷 can't be any of the letters from previous guesses (n, b, x, k, c, s, z, h, p). So remaining possible letters for 🐷: a, e, g, i, j, l, o, q, r, u, v, y.\n\nLet's go back to \"ta🐼🐼\". Let's think of \"taLL\" (tall). So if 🐼=l, then \"taLL\" would be \"tall\". Let's check attempt 1: they guessed 🐼=l, and feedback was False. Oh right, in attempt 1, 🐼=l was guessed and feedback said False. So 🐼≠l. Then, attempt 2: 🐼=s (False). Attempt 3: 🐼=n (False). Attempt 4: 🐼=f (False, but 😈=f already). Attempt 5: 🐼=c (False). Attempt 6: 🐼=r (False). Attempt 7: 🐼=g (False). Attempt 8: 🐼=t (False, since 😍=t). Attempt 9: 🐼=b (False). So possible letters for 🐼: a, e, i, j, k, o, q, u, v, y, z. Let's think of \"taXX\" again. If \"taXX\" is \"tact\", but that's two different letters. \"taXX\" could be \"tale\" (t-a-l-e, but two different letters). \"tank\" (t-a-n-k, different). \"taco\" (t-a-c-o, different). \"tart\" (t-a-r-t, two 't's, but 😍=t, so 🐼 would be 'r'? But attempt 6 guessed 🐼=r and feedback was False. So \"tart\" is out. \"tass\" (t-a-s-s) — if 🐼=s, but attempt 2 guessed 🐼=s (False). \"tall\" (t-a-l-l), 🐼=l (attempt 1: False). \"tatt\" (t-a-t-t), but 🐼=t (attempt 8: False). \"tads\" (t-a-d-s) — different letters. \"taps\" (t-a-p-s) — different. \"tans\" (t-a-n-s) — different. \"tamp\" (t-a-m-p) — different. \"tame\" (t-a-m-e) — different. \"take\" (t-a-k-e) — different. \"tale\" (t-a-l-e) — different.\n\nAnother angle: the phrase \"taXX mission\". If \"taXX mission\" is \"tactical mission\", but \"tactical\" is 8 letters, so that's not matching. \"Target mission\"? \"Target\" is t-a-r-g-e-t, which would need multiple emojis. Not helpful.\n\nLet's check the part \"🐸e😈ea😍e🐸\" — with 🐸=d, 😈=f, 😍=t. So \"d e f e a t e d\" — \"defeated\". Oh! That's \"defeated\"! Let's confirm: 🐸=d, so \"d\" + \"e\" + 😈=f → \"de\" + \"f\" + \"e\" + \"a\" + 😍=t → \"fea\" + \"t\" + \"e\" + 🐸=d → \"ted\" → So \"d e f e a t e d\" — \"defeated\"! That's a full word. Perfect. So that part is \"defeated\".\n\nSo the first part of the encoded sentence is \"😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸\" → \"t a 🐼🐼 defeated\". So \"taXX defeated\". So \"taXX\" is a word that comes before \"defeated\". Possible words: \"task defeated\", \"team defeated\", \"tank defeated\", \"tale defeated\", \"tall defeated\", etc. But \"taXX\" is \"ta\" followed by two of the same emoji (so two same letters). Let's think of \"team\" — no, \"team\" is t-e-a-m, different letters. \"task\" — t-a-s-k. \"tank\" — t-a-n-k. \"tall\" — t-a-l-l (two l's). \"twin\" — no. \"tass\" — t-a-s-s (two s's). \"toll\" — t-o-l-l (but \"ta\" would be \"to\", no). \"tact\" — t-a-c-t (two t's, but \"ta\" + \"ct\", but \"ct\" would be two different letters). \n\nWait, \"taXX\" could be \"task\" if \"XX\" are two different letters, but the emoji is the same. Oh, but the emoji is the same, so the letters must be the same. So \"taXX\" is \"ta\" + two of the same letter. So \"taLL\", \"taSS\", \"taNN\", etc. Let's check \"taLL defeated\" → \"tall defeated\". \"The tall was defeated\"? Maybe. \"taSS defeated\" → \"tass defeated\" (tass is a news agency, but maybe not). \"taNN defeated\" → \"tann defeated\" (unlikely). \"taPP defeated\" → \"tapp defeated\" (no). \"taDD defeated\" → \"tadd defeated\" (no). \"taGG defeated\" → \"tagg defeated\" (no). \"taZZ defeated\" → \"tazz defeated\" (no). \n\nAnother part: \"😍a🐼🐼🐦ission\" → \"t a 🐼🐼 m ission\". So \"taXX mission\". So \"taXX mission\" — \"tall mission\", \"tass mission\", etc. \"Tall mission\" could make sense. \"Tass mission\" (if Tass is an organization) but not common. \"Tact mission\" — but \"tact\" is t-a-c-t (two different letters, so emoji would need to be c and t, but t is already 😍).\n\nLet's think of another angle. The word \"a🐷\" — \"a\" + 🐷. So \"aX\". In the encoded sentence, it's \"a🐷 sno🐶\" → \"aX snow\". So \"aX snow\". Let's think of \"aX snow\" as \"a new snow\" (but 🐷≠n), \"a fresh snow\" (X=f, but 😈=f), \"a light snow\" (X=l), \"a heavy snow\" (X=h), \"a soft snow\" (X=s), \"a hard snow\" (X=h), \"a cold snow\" (X=c), \"a thick snow\" (X=t), \"a wet snow\" (X=w, but 🐶=w), \"a dry snow\" (X=r), \"a powdery snow\" (X=p), \"a deep snow\" (X=d, but 🐸=d). \n\nFrom previous guesses, 🐷 was guessed as n, b, x, k, c, s, z, h, p (all False). So possible letters left for 🐷: a, e, g, i, j, l, o, q, r, u, v, y. Let's try \"a light snow\" → X=l. So 🐷=l. But let's check if that works elsewhere. If 🐷=l, then \"a🐷\" is \"al\". \"al snow\" → \"al snow\" doesn't make sense. \"a great snow\" → X=g. \"a great snow\" → \"a great snow\" → 🐷=g. Let's check \"a great snow\". \"Great\" is g-r-e-a-t, but \"a great snow\" would be \"a great snow\" → \"a g snow\"? No, because \"a🐷\" is \"a\" + single letter. Oh wait, \"a🐷\" is \"a\" followed by one emoji (🐷), so \"a\" + one letter. So \"aX\" where X is one letter. So \"aX snow\" → \"a [single letter] snow\". That's tricky. Possible words: \"a snow\" (but that's \"a snow\" → X is nothing, no). \"a snow\" is just \"a snow\", but \"aX snow\" implies X is a letter. Maybe \"a snow\" is part of a larger term. Maybe \"a snow\" is correct, but X is a letter. Alternatively, maybe \"aX\" is part of a compound word. \n\nLet's look at another part: \"a🐷 sno🐶\" → \"aX snow\". Maybe \"aX\" is \"and\" but \"and\" is three letters. No. \"aX\" could be \"as\" (X=s) but attempt 6 guessed 🐷=s (False). \"at\" (X=t) but 😍=t. \"an\" (X=n) attempt 1: 🐷=n (False). \"am\" (X=m) but 🐦=m. \"aw\" (X=w) 🐶=w. \"ax\" (X=x) attempt 3: 🐷=x (False). \"ay\" (X=y) possible. \"a y snow\" → \"a y snow\" doesn't make sense. \"au\" (X=u) → \"a u snow\" → \"a u snow\" (no). \"ao\" (X=o) → \"a o snow\" (no). \"ai\" (X=i) → \"a i snow\" (no). \"aj\" (X=j) → \"a j snow\" (no). \"aq\" (X=q) → \"a q snow\" (no). \"av\" (X=v) → \"a v snow\" (no). So this approach might not be working.\n\nLet's go back to \"taXX\". Since \"taXX defeated\" and \"taXX mission\" are parts, maybe \"taXX\" is \"task\". But \"task\" is t-a-s-k, which would need two different emojis. But in the encoded sentence, it's \"😍a🐼🐼\" → \"t a 🐼🐼\" → \"ta\" followed by two of the same emoji. So \"ta\" + two of the same letter. So \"task\" would need 🐼=s and another emoji for k, but here it's two of the same emoji. So \"taXX\" must have two identical letters. Let's think of \"tact\" (t-a-c-t), but that's two t's (but 😍=t, so the emoji for t is 😍, so \"tact\" would be \"t a c t\" → \"😍a[c]😍\". But the encoded sentence has \"😍a🐼🐼\", which is \"t a 🐼🐼\" → two of the same emoji, not 😍. So \"tact\" is out. \"Tatt\" (t-a-t-t) → \"t a t t\" → \"😍a😍😍\". But the encoded has \"😍a🐼🐼\", so different emoji. So \"tatt\" is out.\n\nAnother possibility: \"taXX\" is \"tale\" (t-a-l-e), but again, two different letters. Not matching. \"Tale\" would need two different emojis. \n\nWhat if \"taXX\" is a name or acronym? Like \"TASS\" (the Soviet news agency). \"TASS\" is t-a-s-s. So \"taSS\" → \"t a s s\". So if 🐼=s, then \"ta🐼🐼\" would be \"taSS\". But in attempt 2, they guessed 🐼=s and feedback was False. So 🐼≠s. \n\nHmm. Let's check the feedback for 🐼 again. All previous guesses for 🐼 (l, s, n, f, c, r, g, t, b) were wrong. So possible letters left: a, e, i, j, k, o, q, u, v, y, z. Let's try \"taXX\" with these letters.\n\nIf 🐼=k → \"taKK\" → \"takk\" (Norwegian for thanks) → \"takk defeated\"? Unlikely. \n\nIf 🐼=o → \"taOO\" → \"taoo\" (no). \n\nIf 🐼=e → \"taEE\" → \"taee\" (no). \n\nIf 🐼=i → \"taII\" → \"taii\" (no). \n\nIf 🐼=j → \"taJJ\" → \"tajj\" (no). \n\nIf 🐼=q → \"taQQ\" → \"taqq\" (no). \n\nIf 🐼=u → \"taUU\" → \"ta uu\" (no). \n\nIf 🐼=v → \"taVV\" → \"tavv\" (no). \n\nIf 🐼=y → \"taYY\" → \"tayy\" (no). \n\nIf 🐼=z → \"taZZ\" → \"tazz\" (no). \n\nHmm. Maybe \"taXX\" isn't a separate word but part of a larger word. Let's look at the entire first part: \"😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸\" → \"taXX defeated\". Maybe \"taXX\" is \"task\" even if the letters are different. Wait, but the emoji is the same, so the letters must be the same. Oh, unless there's a typo, but I don't think so. \n\nLet's check another part: \"😍o sub🐦i😍\" → \"t o sub m i t\" → \"to submit\". That's correct. \n\nThe part \"🐶i😍h\" → \"w i t h\" → \"with\". Correct. \n\n\"😍he\" → \"t h e\" → \"the\". Correct. \n\n\"😈orce🐸\" → \"f o r c e d\" → \"forced\". Correct. \n\nSo the remaining unknowns are 🐼 and 🐷. Let's try to think of \"taXX mission\". If \"taXX mission\" is \"tactical mission\", but \"tactical\" is t-a-c-t-i-c-a-l. Not matching. \"Tactical mission\" would need more letters. \n\nAnother angle: \"taXX\" could be \"tank\". \"Tank mission\" → \"tank mission\". But \"tank\" is t-a-n-k, which would need two different emojis (n and k). But in the encoded sentence, it's two of the same emoji. So \"taXX\" can't be \"tank\". \n\nWait, maybe \"taXX\" is \"tall\". \"Tall mission\" → \"tall mission\". \"Tall\" is t-a-l-l. So if 🐼=l, then \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"ta ll\" → \"tall\". But attempt 1 guessed 🐼=l and feedback was False. So that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"taXX\" is \"tass\". \"Tass mission\" → \"tass mission\". \"Tass\" is a news agency. \"Tass defeated\" → \"tass defeated\". But attempt 2 guessed 🐼=s (False). So no. \n\nLet's think about the word \"a🐷\". If \"a🐷\" is \"an\" (but 🐷=n was tried, feedback False), \"as\" (s tried, False), \"at\" (t is 😍), \"am\" (m is 🐦), \"ax\" (x tried, False), \"aw\" (w is 🐶), \"ay\" (y possible). So \"ay\" → \"a y\". \"a y snow\" → \"a y snow\" doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, \"a🐷\" could be part of a verb phrase. Like \"aX\" as in \"a x\" where x is a verb. But \"a x snow\" → not making sense. \n\nMaybe \"a🐷\" is a typo or abbreviation. Let's think of \"a🐷 sno🐶\" → \"aX snow\". Maybe \"aX\" is \"and\" but that's three letters. No. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"a🐷\" is \"a's\" (possessive), but \"a's snow\" → \"a's snow\" (unlikely). \n\nLet's try to think of the entire encoded sentence with knowns:\n\nEncoded Sentence decoded with knowns:\n\nt a 🐼🐼 d e f e a t e d a 🐷 s n o w (5: 20) t a 🐼🐼 f o r c e d s n o w t o s u b m i t w i t h t h e t a 🐼🐼 m i s s i o n.\n\nPutting spaces where they should be:\n\n\"taXX defeated aX snow (5: 20) taXX forced snow to submit with the taXX mission.\"\n\nSo the structure is: [taXX] defeated [aX] snow... [taXX] forced snow... the [taXX] mission.\n\nIf \"taXX mission\" is \"tactical mission\", but \"tactical\" is 8 letters, which doesn't fit. \"Tact mission\" (5 letters) → \"tact mission\" (t-a-c-t mission). But \"tact\" is 4 letters. \"taXX\" is 4 letters (t-a-XX), so \"tact\" would be t-a-c-t, which is 4 letters, so \"taXX\" would be \"ct\" (but two different letters). So that's not possible. \n\nAnother possibility: \"taXX\" is \"task\". \"Task mission\" → \"task mission\". \"Task defeated aX snow... task forced snow... the task mission.\" That makes sense. But \"task\" is t-a-s-k, which would need two different emojis (s and k). But the encoded sentence has \"😍a🐼🐼\" → \"t a 🐼🐼\", which is two of the same emoji. So \"taXX\" can't be \"task\" unless the two letters are the same. \n\nWait, maybe \"taXX\" is \"tass\" (t-a-s-s), which is 4 letters, with two 's's. So \"taXX\" is \"tass\". Then \"tass defeated aX snow... tass forced snow... the tass mission.\" That could work. But \"tass\" is a specific term. If 🐼=s, but attempt 2 guessed 🐼=s (feedback False). So that's out. \n\nWhat if \"taXX\" is \"tall\" (t-a-l-l), and the feedback for 🐼=l in attempt 1 was a mistake? No, the feedback says 🐼=l was False. So that's not possible. \n\nLet's think of other two-letter repeats. \"taXX\" could be \"toll\" (t-o-l-l), but \"ta\" would be \"to\", so no. \"Tool\" (t-o-o-l), no. \"Tea\" (no, not enough letters). \n\nAnother approach: frequency. Let's count the emojis in the encoded sentence to see which are most frequent. The emojis are: 😍 (many times), 🐼 (appears in \"😍a🐼🐼\" multiple times), 🐸 (appears a few times), 😈 (a few), 🐷 (once), 🐶 (a few), 🐦 (a few). \n\nWe know 😍=t (most frequent, which fits). 🐸=d (from feedback). 😈=f. 🐶=w. 🐦=m. So the remaining emojis are 🐼 and 🐷. \n\nThe encoded sentence has \"😍a🐼🐼\" appearing three times. So \"taXX\" appears three times. That suggests \"taXX\" is an important word, like a name or a key term. Maybe \"task\" even if the letters are different, but the emoji is the same. Wait, but the problem states each emoji is a unique letter. So each emoji represents one letter, so \"🐼\" is one letter. So \"😍a🐼🐼\" is \"t a [🐼][🐼]\" → \"ta\" + two of the same letter. So \"taLL\" (tall), \"taSS\" (tass), etc. \n\nSince all previous guesses for 🐼 are wrong, maybe the letter is 'k'. Let's try 🐼=k. Then \"taKK\" → \"takk\" (Norwegian for thanks). \"Takk defeated aX snow... takk forced snow... the takk mission.\" Unlikely. \n\nWhat about 'e'? 🐼=e. \"taEE\" → \"taee\". No. \n\nMaybe 'o'? 🐼=o. \"taOO\" → \"taoo\". No. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the letters are 'p'. 🐼=p. \"taPP\" → \"tapp\". \"Tapp defeated aX snow... tapp forced snow... the tapp mission.\" No. \n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's look at the part \"a🐷 sno🐶\" → \"aX snow\". If \"aX\" is \"a new\", but \"new\" is three letters. No. \"a new snow\" → \"a new snow\" would be \"a n e w snow\", but \"a🐷\" is \"a\" + one emoji (🐷), so \"a\" + one letter. So \"aX\" is \"a\" + one letter. So \"a new snow\" would require \"a\" + \"n\" (🐷=n), but attempt 1 guessed 🐷=n (False). So that's not it. \n\nAnother possibility: \"aX\" is \"a x\" where x is a verb, like \"a plow snow\" → \"a plow snow\" but \"plow\" is four letters. No. \n\nLet's think of \"taXX mission\" again. If \"taXX mission\" is \"tactical mission\", but \"tactical\" is t-a-c-t-i-c-a-l. The encoded part is \"😍a🐼🐼🐦ission\" → \"t a 🐼🐼 m ission\" → \"taXX mission\". So \"taXX\" is the first part of \"tactical\" → \"tact\". \"Tact mission\" → \"tact mission\". \"Tact\" is t-a-c-t, which is four letters. So \"taXX\" would be \"ct\" (c and t). But \"t\" is 😍, so \"ct\" would be [c] 😍. But the encoded is \"😍a🐼🐼\" → \"t a 🐼🐼\", which is \"t a\" followed by two of the same emoji. So \"t a c t\" would be \"😍a[c]😍\", which doesn't match \"😍a🐼🐼\". So that's not possible. \n\nMaybe \"taXX\" is \"team\". \"Team mission\" → \"team mission\". \"Team\" is t-e-a-m. So \"t e a m\" → \"😍[e]a[🐦]\" (since 🐦=m). But the encoded is \"😍a🐼🐼\" → \"t a 🐼🐼\", which would be \"t a [🐼][🐼]\". So \"team\" would be \"t e a m\" → different structure. So no. \n\nAt this point, perhaps the only remaining option is to guess the remaining possible letters for 🐼 and 🐷. Since this is the 10th attempt (last one), I need to make a guess. Let's list possible letters for 🐼 (not guessed before): a, e, i, j, k, o, q, u, v, y, z. Let's pick 'k' for 🐼 (since 'k' hasn't been guessed yet for 🐼). And for 🐷, possible letters (not guessed before): a, e, g, i, j, l, o, q, r, u, v, y. Let's pick 'g' for 🐷. \n\nSo the guess would be: 😍=t,🐼=k,🐸=d,😈=f,🐷=g,🐶=w,🐦=m.\n\nTo solve this Crypto Word Game, we analyze the encoded sentence, known hints, and feedback from previous attempts. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Known Correct Emojis (from Feedback):\n- 😍=t (confirmed)\n- 😈=f (confirmed)\n- 🐶=w (confirmed)\n- 🐦=m (confirmed)\n- 🐸=d (confirmed in attempt 2 and subsequent attempts)\n\n### Remaining Unknowns: 🐼 and 🐷\nThe encoded sentence contains repeated patterns with these emojis. Key observations:\n1. **😍a🐼🐼** appears multiple times (e.g., \"t a 🐼🐼 defeated\" and \"t a 🐼🐼 mission\"). This suggests \"taXX\" where \"XX\" is a repeated letter (since 🐼 is a single emoji, it represents one letter, so \"XX\" are two instances of that letter).\n2. **a🐷 sno🐶** translates to \"a [🐷] snow\" (since 🐶=w). This requires \"aX snow\" where \"X\" is a single letter (🐷).\n\n### Previous Guesses for 🐼 (All Incorrect):\nAttempts 1-9 guessed 🐼 as l, s, n, f, c, r, g, t, b (all False). Remaining possible letters: a, e, i, j, k, o, q, u, v, y, z.\n\n### Previous Guesses for 🐷 (All Incorrect):\nAttempts 1-9 guessed 🐷 as n, b, x, k, c, s, z, h, p (all False). Remaining possible letters: a, e, g, i, j, l, o, q, r, u, v, y.\n\n### Final Guess:\nGiven the context, \"taXX mission\" and \"taXX defeated\" suggest \"taXX\" is a key term. Assuming 🐼=k (untested, fits \"taKK\" as a plausible structure), and 🐷=g (untested, fits \"a g snow\" as a possible phrase), the final guess is:\n\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐼=k,🐸=d,😈=f,🐷=g,🐶=w,🐦=m"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
