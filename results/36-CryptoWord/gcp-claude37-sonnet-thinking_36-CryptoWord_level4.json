Also \"$750.00\" appears as is.\n\nFirst, I'll count the frequency of each emoji to see if any patterns emerge:\n\n🐸 appears 3 times\n🤑 appears 4 times\n🥺 appears 3 times\n🐻 appears 5 times\n😈 appears 1 time\n🤔 appears 3 times\n🦊 appears 4 times\nt appears multiple times (not encoded, actual letter t)\n🤖 appears 3 times\ni appears multiple times (not encoded, actual letter i)\n😎 appears 2 times\n🤗 appears 3 times\n😴 appears 3 times\nz appears 1 time (not encoded, actual letter z)\n🤩 appears 7 times (which we know is 'r')\nd appears multiple times (not encoded, actual letter d)\n🤧 appears 1 time\n🙄 appears 1 time\n🐭 appears 1 time\n🥴 appears 4 times\nn appears 1 time (not encoded, actual letter n)\n\nI notice that 't', 'i', 'z', 'd', and 'n' are not encoded in the text. \n\nNow let's try to deduce some more letters using common English patterns:\n\n1. Single letter words in English are typically 'a' and 'I'. I don't see any single emoji words.\n\n2. Common two-letter words include: 'to', 'in', 'is', 'it', 'of', 'on', 'at', 'be', etc. I see \"in\" not encoded, and \"🦊😴\" which could be 'of', 'on', 'at', etc.\n\n3. Common three-letter words include: 'the', 'and', 'for', 'but', etc. I see \"🐸🐻🤩\" which could be 'for' since the last letter is 'r' (🤩).\n\n4. Let's look for patterns in the word \"🤩🐻t🥴\" which might be common. Given 🤩 is 'r', it could be words like 'rats', 'rate', etc.\n\n5. The word \"🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈\" seems to be the first word of the sentence, so it's likely to be a proper noun or a common starting word like 'These', 'Those', etc.\n\nLet's try to deduce more:\n\nSince 🤩 is 'r', and there's a word \"🐸🐻🤩\", and I guessed it might be 'for', that would mean 🐸 is 'f' and 🐻 is 'o'.\n\nIf 🐻 is 'o', then the word \"🤩🐻t🥴\" could be 'rots' or 'rote', so 🥴 might be 's' or 'e'.\n\nThe phrase \"😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d\" with 🤩 as 'r' gives us \"?t?r?ird\" which looks like it could be \"starbird\" or similar. So 😴 might be 's', 🤔 might be 'a', and 🙄 might be 'b'.\n\nIf 🤔 is 'a', then \"d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺\" becomes \"dar???\" which might be \"darren\", \"darrel\", etc. This suggests 🤧 and 🥺 might be consecutive letters like 're' or 'ri'.\n\nThe phrase \"🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩\" with my guesses becomes \"?o?to?iz?r\" which might be \"motorizer\" or similar. If 😴 is 's', then 🤗 might be 'm' and 🦊 might be 'o'.\n\nBut this creates a conflict since we already guessed 🐻 as 'o'.\n\nLet me reconsider:\n\nIf the word \"🐸🐻🤩\" is 'for', then 🐸 is 'f' and 🐻 is 'o'.\n\nThe phrase \"🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩\" becomes \"??to?iz?r\". If 🐻 is 'o', this looks more like \"motorizer\". So 🤗 might be 'm', 🦊 might be 'o', 😴 might be 't', and 🤖 might be 'r'.\n\nBut this creates a conflict with 🤩 as 'r'. Let's reevaluate.\n\nActually, the specific word might be \"motorized\" or similar. Let's check against the encoded word: \"🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩\". \n\nIf 🤗 is 'm', 🦊 is 'o', 😴 is 't', 🐻 is 'o', 🤖 is 'r', 🤑 is 'e', and 🤩 is 'r', then we get \"motorizer\".\n\nBut wait, there's also an actual 't' in this word (\"🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩\"), which means 😴 can't be 't'. Let me reconsider.\n\nThe word \"🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩\" with actual letters becomes \"🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑r\". If 🐻 is 'o', this still looks like it might be \"motorized\" or similar.\n\nOk, I think I need to be more systematic here. Let's first identify all the places where the actual letters appear:\n\nOriginal: 🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈 🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩 d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺 😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d 🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d t🥴🤑 😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑 🐸🤩🐻🤖 🤩🐻t🥴 in 1967 🐸🐻🤩 🦊😴 $750.00.\n\nBreaking it down:\n1. 🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈\n2. 🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑 (has 't' and 'i')\n3. 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩 (has 't', 'i', 'z')\n4. d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺 (has 'd')\n5. 😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d (has 't', 'i', 'd')\n6. 🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d (has 'd')\n7. t🥴🤑 (has 't')\n8. 😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑 (has 'i')\n9. 🐸🤩🐻🤖 (has no unencoded letters)\n10. 🤩🐻t🥴 (has 't')\n11. in (completely unencoded)\n12. 1967 (year, not encoded)\n13. 🐸🐻🤩 (has no unencoded letters)\n14. 🦊😴 (has no unencoded letters)\n15. $750.00 (not encoded).\n\nThis looks like a sentence about purchasing something in 1967 for $750.00. The word \"in\" is not encoded, which suggests this is talking about a specific event or purchase.\n\nNow, let's apply the knowledge that 🤩 is 'r':\n1. 🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈\n2. 🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑 (has 't' and 'i')\n3. 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑r (has 't', 'i', 'z')\n4. d🤔rr🤧🥺 (has 'd')\n5. 😴t🤔r🙄ird (has 't', 'i', 'd')\n6. 🐭🦊r🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d (has 'd')\n7. t🥴🤑 (has 't')\n8. 😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑 (has 'i')\n9. 🐸r🐻🤖 (has no unencoded letters)\n10. r🐻t🥴 (has 't')\n11. in (completely unencoded)\n12. 1967 (year, not encoded)\n13. 🐸🐻r (has no unencoded letters)\n14. 🦊😴 (has no unencoded letters)\n15. $750.00 (not encoded).\n\nOkay, I think the word \"🐸🤩🐻🤖\" is likely \"from\", given the context of the sentence. This would mean 🐸 is 'f', 🐻 is 'o', and 🤖 is 'm'.\n\nApplying these:\n1. f🤑🥺🥺o😈\n2. 🤔🦊to🤖oti😎🤑 (has 't' and 'i')\n3. 🤗🦊😴to🤖iz🤑r (has 't', 'i', 'z')\n4. d🤔rr🤧🥺 (has 'd')\n5. 😴t🤔r🙄ird (has 't', 'i', 'd')\n6. 🐭🦊r🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d (has 'd')\n7. t🥴🤑 (has 't')\n8. 😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑 (has 'i')\n9. from (has no unencoded letters)\n10. rot🥴 (has 't')\n11. in (completely unencoded)\n12. 1967 (year, not encoded)\n13. for (has no unencoded letters)\n14. 🦊😴 (has no unencoded letters)\n15. $750.00 (not encoded).\n\nAlso, with 🤖 as 'm', the word \"🤗🦊😴to🤖iz🤑r\" looks like it might be \"motorized\". This would mean 🤗 is 'm', 🦊 is 'o', 😴 is 't', and 🤑 is 'e'.\n\nLet's apply these:\n1. fe🥺🥺o😈\n2. 🤔otomoti😎e (has 't' and 'i')\n3. mot🐻mized (has 't', 'i', 'z')\n4. d🤔rr🤧🥺 (has 'd')\n5. 😴t🤔r🙄ird (has 't', 'i', 'd')\n6. 🐭or🤗🥴🤔😴ed (has 'd')\n7. t🥴e (has 't')\n8. 😎e🥴i🤗🥺e (has 'i')\n9. from (has no unencoded letters)\n10. rot🥴 (has 't')\n11. in (completely unencoded)\n12. 1967 (year, not encoded)\n13. for (has no unencoded letters)\n14. o😴 (has no unencoded letters)\n15. $750.00 (not encoded).\n\nBut there's a conflict now, as 🤗 would be 'm' based on \"motorized\" but also appears in words 6 and 8. Let's re-examine.\n\nWait, I misread. I noticed the word \"🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩\" actually doesn't seem to match \"motorized\". Let's carefully check again:\n\n\"🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩\" has 9 characters.\n\"motorized\" has 9 characters.\n\nComparing:\nm (🤗) o (🦊) t (😴) o (🐻) r (🤖) i (i) z (z) e (🤑) d (🤩)\n\nBut 🤩 is given as 'r', so there's a mismatch with 'd'. This suggests \"🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩\" might not be \"motorized\" but another word.\n\nLet's reconsider the pattern from the beginning. It's possible the sentence is about a car or vehicle.\n\nGiven 🤩 is 'r':\n1. 🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈\n2. 🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑 (has 't' and 'i')\n3. 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑r (has 't', 'i', 'z')\n4. d🤔rr🤧🥺 (has 'd')\n5. 😴t🤔r🙄ird (has 't', 'i', 'd')\n6. 🐭🦊r🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d (has 'd')\n7. t🥴🤑 (has 't')\n8. 😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑 (has 'i')\n9. 🐸r🐻🤖 (has no unencoded letters)\n10. r🐻t🥴 (has 't')\n11. in (completely unencoded)\n12. 1967 (year, not encoded)\n13. 🐸🐻r (has no unencoded letters)\n14. 🦊😴 (has no unencoded letters)\n15. $750.00 (not encoded).\n\nThe phrase \"🐸🤩🐻🤖 🤩🐻t🥴 in 1967 🐸🐻🤩 🦊😴 $750.00\" is likely \"from [something] in 1967 for [something] $750.00\".\n\nThe word \"🤩🐻t🥴\" could be \"rots\" or \"rote\". Since it's paired with \"in 1967\", it seems like a date or model year, so \"rots\" doesn't make sense. \"rote\" might be a model or make of a vehicle.\n\nIf 🤩 is 'r', 🐻 is 'o', and 🥴 is 'e', the phrase would be \"from rote in 1967 for o😴 $750.00\".\n\nThe word \"o😴\" might be \"of\" or \"on\". \n\nNow let's look at the beginning of the sentence:\n\"🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈 🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑r\"\n\nIf 🐸 is 'f', 🤑 is 'e', and 🐻 is 'o', the first part is \"fe🥺🥺o😈\". This might be a name, perhaps \"fellow\" which would mean 🥺 is 'l' and 😈 is 'w'.\n\nThe next part, \"🤔🦊to🤖oti😎e\", might be \"automotive\" which would mean 🤔 is 'a', 🦊 is 'u', 🤖 is 'm', and 😎 is 'v'.\n\nNow let's re-apply all we've deduced:\n🤩 is 'r'\n🐸 is 'f'\n🤑 is 'e'\n🥺 is 'l'\n😈 is 'w'\n🤔 is 'a'\n🦊 is 'u'\n🤖 is 'm'\n😎 is 'v'\n🥴 is 'e' (but this creates a conflict with 🤑 as 'e')\n\nLet's review this. I think I made a mistake. Since \"🐸🤩🐻🤖\" is likely \"from\", 🐻 should be 'o', not 'e'. So 🥴 is more likely to be 'e'.\n\nReapplying:\n🤩 is 'r'\n🐸 is 'f'\n🤑 is 'e' (but this conflicts with 🥴 as 'e')\n🥺 is 'l'\n😈 is 'w'\n🤔 is 'a'\n🦊 is 'u'\n🤖 is 'm'\n😎 is 'v'\n🥴 is 'e'\n\nThere's a conflict between 🤑 and 🥴, both which I've assigned to 'e'. Let's reconsider.\n\nI think the word \"fellow\" for the first word makes sense, so 🥺 is 'l' and 😈 is 'w'. \n\nIf 🤑 is 'e', then the next word, \"🤔🦊to🤖oti😎e\", is \"automobile\". \n\nThe third word, \"🤗🦊😴to🤖ize🤩\", might be \"customizer\". This would mean 🤗 is 'c', 😴 is 's'.\n\nLet's reapply:\n🤩 is 'r'\n🐸 is 'f'\n🤑 is 'e'\n🥺 is 'l'\n😈 is 'w'\n🤔 is 'a'\n🦊 is 'u'\n🤖 is 'm'\n😎 is 'v'\n🤗 is 'c'\n😴 is 's'\n\nWith these assignments, the phrase \"fellow automobile customizer\" makes sense as the beginning of the sentence.\n\nNow let's look at \"da🤩🤩🤧l\". With 🤩 as 'r', this is \"darr🤧l\". This is likely a name like \"Darrell\", so 🤧 is 'e'.\n\nNext, \"😴ta🤩🙄i🤩d\" would be \"star🙄ird\" with 😴 as 's'. This might be a last name like \"Starbird\", so 🙄 might be 'b'.\n\nThen, \"🐭u🤩🤗🥴a😴ed\" becomes \"cue\" with 🐭 as '?' and so on. Let's see if 🐭 could be 'p'. \"pu🤩cha😴ed\" would be \"purchased\" with 🥴 as 'h'. This makes sense.\n\nApplying these:\n🤩 is 'r'\n🐸 is 'f'\n🤑 is 'e'\n🥺 is 'l'\n😈 is 'w'\n🤔 is 'a'\n🦊 is 'u'\n🤖 is 'm'\n😎 is 'v'\n🤗 is 'c'\n😴 is 's'\n🤧 is 'e' (but this conflicts with 🤑 as 'e')\n🙄 is 'b'\n🐭 is 'p'\n🥴 is 'h'\n\nNow we have a conflict between 🤧 and 🤑, both as 'e'. Let's re-evaluate.\n\nThe phrase \"da🤩🤩🤧l\" might not be \"Darrell\" but \"Daryl\" or another name. But given the context, I think \"Darrell\" makes the most sense. Let's revisit.\n\nIf 🤧 is 'e', then 🤑 can't be 'e'. Let's reconsider the word I thought was \"automobile\". Actually, it looks like \"automotiv🤑\" which might be \"automotive\", making 🤑 as 'e' correct.\n\n\"fellow automotive customizer darr🤧l\" suggests a name, and likely \"Darrell\". So 🤧 is indeed 'e'.\n\nThe conflict between 🤧 and 🤑 both as 'e' suggests I made a mistake.\n\nLet's re-read the encoded sentence:\n\"🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈 🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑 🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩 d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺 😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d 🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d t🥴🤑 😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑 🐸🤩🐻🤖 🤩🐻t🥴 in 1967 🐸🐻🤩 🦊😴 $750.00.\"\n\nWith the known letters:\n🤩 is 'r'\n🐸 is 'f'\n🥺 is 'l'\n😈 is 'w'\n🤔 is 'a'\n🦊 is 'u'\n🐻 is 'o'\n🤖 is 'm'\n😎 is 'v'\n🤗 is 'c'\n😴 is 's'\n🙄 is 'b'\n🐭 is 'p'\n🥴 is 'h'\n\nLet's reconsider 🤑 and 🤧 for 'e'.\n\nThe beginning of the sentence \"f🤑llow automotive customiz🤑r\" strongly suggests 🤑 is 'e'. \n\nFor \"darr🤧l\", 🤧 is likely another vowel like 'e', 'y', or 'o'. \"Darryl\" or \"Darrol\" are possible names, but \"Darrell\" is more common. So 🤧 is likely 'e', creating a conflict.\n\nLet's look at the encoded sentence more carefully to see if I've misread something.\n\nWait, I have misread. The second word is not \"automotive\" but \"🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑\". This would be \"automotiv🤑\" with our guesses, which is \"automotive\". This means 🤑 is 'e'.\n\nThe third word is \"🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩\", which with our guesses is \"customiz🤑r\". This is \"customizer\", confirming 🤑 is 'e'.\n\nFor the name, the encoded word is \"d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺\", which with our guesses is \"darr🤧l\". If this is \"Darrell\", then 🤧is 'e', creating our conflict.\n\nLet me check if I've misread this word. \"d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺\" has 6 characters. \"Darrell\" has 7 characters. So it can't be \"Darrell\".\n\nWith 🤔 as 'a', 🤩 as 'r', and 🥺 as 'l', we have \"darr🤧l\". This might be \"Darryl\". So 🤧 might be 'y'.\n\nLet's apply that:\n🤧 is 'y'\n\nSo we have:\n🤩 is 'r'\n🐸 is 'f'\n🤑 is 'e'\n🥺 is 'l'\n😈 is 'w'\n🤔 is 'a'\n🦊 is 'u'\n🐻 is 'o'\n🤖 is 'm'\n😎 is 'v'\n🤗 is 'c'\n😴 is 's'\n🤧 is 'y'\n🙄 is 'b'\n🐭 is 'p'\n🥴 is 'h'\n\nNow, \"😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d\" becomes \"starbird\" with 😴 as 's'. \"Starbird\" might be a last name.\n\nAnd \"🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d\" would be \"purchased\" with 🐭 as 'p'.\n\nFor the next phrase, \"t🥴🤑 😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑\", we have \"the vehicle\" with 😎 as 'v'.\n\nSo the sentence starts to read:\n\"Fellow automotive customizer Darryl Starbird purchased the vehicle from Roth in 1967 for ?? $750.00.\"\n\nThe last unknown word is \"🦊😴\", which with 🦊 as 'u' and 😴 as 's' becomes \"us\". But in the context, \"for us\" doesn't make sense. It's more likely to be \"usually\" or similar. But since it's only 2 characters, \"us\" is the most reasonable.\n\nOh, actually I think I'm wrong. Since 🦊 is 'u', the phrase \"for u😴\" is more likely to be \"for us\" (as in the person saying 'us') or \"for use\" or \"for up\" etc. But, given the context, I think \"for us\" or \"for use\" is the most likely.\n\nSo the sentence might be:\n\"Fellow automotive customizer Darryl Starbird purchased the vehicle from Roth in 1967 for us $750.00.\"\n\nBut \"for us $750.00\" doesn't sound natural. It's more likely to be \"for just $750.00\" or something similar. So maybe 😴 is not 's'. Let's revisit.\n\nWait, I need to recheck my guesses. \n\n\"🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈\" with 🐸 as 'f', 🤑 as 'e', 🥺 as 'l', 🐻 as 'o', and 😈 as 'w' becomes \"fellow\".\n\"🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑\" with 🤔 as 'a', 🦊 as 'u', 🐻 as 'o', 🤖 as 'm', and 😎 as 'v', 🤑 as 'e' becomes \"automotive\".\n\"🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩\" with 🤗 as 'c', 🦊 as 'u', 😴 as 's', 🐻 as 'o', 🤖 as 'm', 🤑 as 'e', and 🤩 as 'r' becomes \"customizer\".\n\"d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺\" with 🤔 as 'a', 🤩 as 'r', 🤧 as 'y', and 🥺 as 'l' becomes \"darryl\".\n\"😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d\" with 😴 as 's', 🤔 as 'a', 🤩 as 'r', and 🙄 as 'b' becomes \"starbird\".\n\"🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d\" with 🐭 as 'p', 🦊 as 'u', 🤩 as 'r', 🤗 as 'c', 🥴 as 'h', 🤔 as 'a', 😴 as 's', and 🤑 as 'e' becomes \"purchased\".\n\"t🥴🤑\" with 🥴 as 'h' and 🤑 as 'e' becomes \"the\".\n\"😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑\" with 😎 as 'v', 🤑 as 'e', 🥴 as 'h', 🤗 as 'c', and 🥺 as 'l' becomes \"vehicle\".\n\"🐸🤩🐻🤖\" with 🐸 as 'f', 🤩 as 'r', 🐻 as 'o', and 🤖 as 'm' becomes \"from\".\n\"🤩🐻t🥴\" with 🤩 as 'r', 🐻 as 'o', and 🥴 as 'h' becomes \"roth\".\n\"🐸🐻🤩\" with 🐸 as 'f', 🐻 as 'o', and 🤩 as 'r' becomes \"for\".\n\"🦊😴\" with 🦊 as 'u' and 😴 as 's' becomes \"us\".\n\nLet me re-read the full sentence with these guesses:\n\"Fellow automotive customizer Darryl Starbird purchased the vehicle from Roth in 1967 for us $750.00.\"\n\nThis sentence sounds coherent, but I still think \"for us $750.00\" is a bit odd. Let's reconsider what 😴 might be. If 😴 is 'j', then \"🦊😴\" becomes \"uj\" which doesn't make a sensible word in English. If 😴 is 'n', then \"🦊😴\" becomes \"un\", which is a prefix but not a standalone word in this context. \n\nI'm pretty confident that 😴 is 's', given the coherence of the rest of the sentence, especially the word \"customizer\" and \"Starbird\". It's possible that the sentence is simply stating that Darryl Starbird purchased the vehicle from Roth for \"us\" (as in, for the group the speaker is a part of) at a price of $750.00.\n\nSo my final decoding is:\n\"Fellow automotive customizer Darryl Starbird purchased the vehicle from Roth in 1967 for us $750.00.\"\n\nHere are the emoji-to-letter mappings:\n🤩 = r\n🐸 = f\n🤑 = e\n🥺 = l\n😈 = w\n🤔 = a\n🦊 = u\n🐻 = o\n🤖 = m\n😎 = v\n🤗 = c\n😴 = s\n🤧 = y\n🙄 = b\n🐭 = p\n🥴 = h\n\nAnd given the problem specifies that previously correctly answered emojis should also be included in the answer, the full mapping to the answer is:\n🤩 = r\n🐸 = f\n🤑 = e\n🥺 = l\n😈 = w\n🤔 = a\n🦊 = u\n🐻 = o\n🤖 = m\n😎 = v\n🤗 = c\n😴 = s\n🤧 = y\n🙄 = b\n🐭 = p\n🥴 = hLooking at this encoded sentence, I need to determine what each emoji represents based on the hint that 🤩 = r.\n\nFirst, I'll examine the sentence structure and look for patterns. Since 🤩 appears multiple times, I can start building words with the 'r' in place.\n\nI notice \"in 1967\" and \"$750.00\" are provided in plain text, which suggests this is about a purchase or financial transaction in that year.\n\nLooking at word patterns:\n- \"🐸🤩🐻🤖\" could be \"from\" (with 🤩 as 'r')\n- \"🐸🐻🤩\" would then be \"for\"\n- This suggests 🐸 = f, 🐻 = o, 🤖 = m\n\nThe first word \"🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈\" might be \"fellow\" which gives us 🤑 = e, 🥺 = l, 😈 = w\n\nThe word \"🤗🦊😴t🐻🤖iz🤑🤩\" has \"iz\" uncoded and ends with 🤩 ('r'), suggesting \"customizer\" which gives us 🤗 = c, 🦊 = u, 😴 = s\n\nLooking at \"🤔🦊t🐻🤖🐻ti😎🤑\", this fits \"automotive\" giving us 🤔 = a, 😎 = v\n\nFor \"d🤔🤩🤩🤧🥺\", this matches \"darryl\" with 🤧 = y\n\nIn \"😴t🤔🤩🙄i🤩d\", we get \"starbird\" with 🙄 = b\n\nFor \"🐭🦊🤩🤗🥴🤔😴🤑d\", we can deduce \"purchased\" with 🐭 = p, 🥴 = h\n\nThe word \"😎🤑🥴i🤗🥺🤑\" matches \"vehicle\"\n\nThe word \"🤩🐻t🥴\" would be \"roth\" (possibly a name)\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence reads: \"Fellow automotive customizer Darryl Starbird purchased the vehicle from Roth in 1967 for us $750.00.\"\n\nAnswer: 🤩=r,🐸=f,🤑=e,🥺=l,😈=w,🤔=a,🦊=u,🐻=o,🤖=m,😎=v,🤗=c,😴=s,🤧=y,🙄=b,🐭=p,🥴=h"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

So:\n   - 🥴 = b or q (likely b)\n   - 🤔 = q\n   - 🐷 = y\n\n2. \"🤮n\" likely corresponds to \"on\" or \"in\". Given the context and the next word, \"in\" seems more likely:\n   - 🤮 = i\n\n3. With 🤮 = i, \"🐼e🥴🥶ua🥶🐷 1941\" could be \"February 1941\" (a date):\n   - 🐼 = F\n   - 🥴 = b (confirming the guess from point 1)\n   - 🥶 = r\n   - 🐷 = y (confirming the guess from point 1)\n\n4. \"600 🥺ews\" could be \"600 Jews\" given the historical context:\n   - 🥺 = J\n\n5. \"we🥶e\" with 🥶 = r becomes \"were\", which makes sense.\n\n6. \"sent t🙄 🥴uc🤩enwal🐸 an🐸 maut🤩ausen\" appears to be naming concentration camps. \"Buchenwald\" and \"Mauthausen\" were indeed Nazi concentration camps. So:\n   - 🙄 = o\n   - 🤩 = h\n   - 🐸 = d\n\n7. \"c🙄ncent🥶at🤮🙄n cam👽s\" would be \"concentration camps\" with the above deductions:\n   - 👽 = p\n\nLet's see if these deductions are consistent:\n\n\"subsequently, in February 1941, 600 Jews were sent to Buchenwald and Mauthausen concentration camps.\"\n\nThis makes sense historically. Let's check our deductions:\n- 🥴 = b\n- 😇 = e (given)\n- 🤔 = q\n- 🐷 = y\n- 🤮 = i\n- 🐼 = F\n- 🥶 = r\n- 🥺 = J\n- 🙄 = o\n- 🤩 = h\n- 🐸 = d\n- 👽 = p\n\nActually, I need to revisit the word I identified as \"subsequently\". Let's see:\ns u 🥴 s 😇 🤔 u 😇 n t l 🐷\n\nIf 🥴 = b, 😇 = e, 🤔 = q, and 🐷 = y, then the word would be \"subsequently\", which doesn't match the pattern. \n\nLet me re-analyze:\n\"s u 🥴 s 😇 🤔 u 😇 n t l 🐷\"\n\nIf 😇 = e, then the pattern is \"s u b s e q u e n t l y\", which seems right for \"subsequently\".\n\nSo 🥴 = b. But wait, I was assuming that the first letter in the sentence is \"s\", but it could be something else.\n\nLet's re-analyze the entire sentence:\n\n\"??🥴s😇🤔u😇ntl🐷, 🤮n 🐼😇🥴🥶ua🥶🐷 1941, 600 🥺😇ws w😇🥶😇 s😇nt t🙄 🥴uc🤩😇nwal🐸 an🐸 maut🤩aus😇n c🙄nc😇nt🥶at🤮🙄n cam👽s.\"\n\nWith 😇 = e, it becomes:\n\"??🥴se🤔uentl🐷, 🤮n 🐼e🥴🥶ua🥶🐷 1941, 600 🥺ews we🥶e sent t🙄 🥴uc🤩enwal🐸 an🐸 maut🤩ausen c🙄ncent🥶at🤮🙄n cam👽s.\"\n\nLooking at the beginning, it looks like \"subsequently\". \"Subsequently, in February 1941, 600 Jews were sent to Buchenwald and Mauthausen concentration camps.\"\n\nSo, my guesses are:\n- 🥴 = b\n- 😇 = e (given)\n- 🤔 = q\n- 🐷 = y\n- 🤮 = i\n- 🐼 = F\n- 🥶 = r\n- 🥺 = J\n- 🙄 = o\n- 🤩 = h\n- 🐸 = d\n- 👽 = p\n\nActually, let's double check by filling in the entire sentence:\n\nOriginal: su🥴s😇🤔u😇ntl🐷, 🤮n 🐼😇🥴🥶ua🥶🐷 1941, 600 🥺😇ws w😇🥶😇 s😇nt t🙄 🥴uc🤩😇nwal🐸 an🐸 maut🤩aus😇n c🙄nc😇nt🥶at🤮🙄n cam👽s.\n\nWith my substitutions:\n\"subsequently, in February 1941, 600 Jews were sent to buchenwald and mauthausen concentration camps.\"\n\nOh, the first letters of names like Buchenwald and February should be capitalized. Actually, I think the emoji-to-letter mapping is case-sensitive here. So 🐼 should be \"F\" and 🥴 and 🤩 might still be correct as \"b\" and \"h\".\n\nLet me revise and be more precise:\n- 🥴 = b\n- 😇 = e (given)\n- 🤔 = q\n- 🐷 = y\n- 🤮 = i\n- 🐼 = F\n- 🥶 = r\n- 🥺 = J\n- 🙄 = o\n- 🤩 = h\n- 🐸 = d\n- 👽 = p\n\nI think these assignments are correct. Let's format the answer as required:\n\nAnswer: 🥴=b,😇=e,🤔=q,🐷=y,🤮=i,🐼=F,🥶=r,🥺=J,🙄=o,🤩=h,🐸=d,👽=p\n\nWait, let me check the sentence one more time to see if the mappings are consistent.\n\nOriginal: su🥴s😇🤔u😇ntl🐷, 🤮n 🐼😇🥴🥶ua🥶🐷 1941, 600 🥺😇ws w😇🥶😇 s😇nt t🙄 🥴uc🤩😇nwal🐸 an🐸 maut🤩aus😇n c🙄nc😇nt🥶at🤮🙄n cam👽s.\n\nWith my substitutions:\n\"s u b s e q u e n t l y, i n F e b r u a r y 1941, 600 J e w s w e r e s e n t t o b u c h e n w a l d a n d m a u t h a u s e n c o n c e n t r a t i o n c a m p s.\"\n\nOk, I think we have a problem. I initially interpreted the beginning of the sentence as starting with \"s\", but the actual encoded sentence doesn't have an emoji for the letters \"s\" and \"u\" at the beginning. These must be literal characters, not encoded ones.\n\nThe sentence starts with \"su🥴s😇🤔u😇ntl🐷\" which I was interpreting as \"subsequently\". But if \"s\" and \"u\" are not encoded, then it would be \"sub?e?uently\" with the emojis decoded. This doesn't make sense for \"subsequently\".\n\nLet me re-analyze just the first word to make sure:\n\"su🥴s😇🤔u😇ntl🐷\"\n\nIf \"s\" and \"u\" are not encoded and 😇 = e, then we have \"su?se?uentl?\".\n\nOne possibility is that 🥴 corresponds to \"b\", 🤔 corresponds to \"q\", and 🐷 corresponds to \"y\", which would give \"subsequently\". This seems like the most plausible interpretation, especially considering the historical context of the rest of the sentence.\n\nSo, I'll stick with my original deductions. The emoji encodings are consistent, and the non-emojis (like \"s\" and \"u\" at the beginning) are just regular characters that aren't part of the encryption.\n\n- 🥴 = b\n- 😇 = e (given)\n- 🤔 = q\n- 🐷 = y\n- 🤮 = i\n- 🐼 = F\n- 🥶 = r\n- 🥺 = J\n- 🙄 = o\n- 🤩 = h\n- 🐸 = d\n- 👽 = p\n\nOk, I finally see the issue. The statement is that the message is \"encoded by replacing each letter with a unique emoji\". But it looks like some letters are not encoded with emoji and appear as is. So the original message is:\n\n\"subsequently, in February 1941, 600 Jews were sent to buchenwald and mauthausen concentration camps.\"\n\nIn the encoded version some of the letters appear to be shown as is (like \"s\", \"u\", \"n\", \"t\", \"l\", etc.), while others are represented by emoji.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, let me revise my thinking. The statement says \"each letter with a unique emoji\", which suggests that the entire message should be encoded. However, the encoded message contains both emojis and regular letters. This would imply that the encryption is selective or that the regular letters are somehow not part of the original message.\n\nActually, I think I've been misinterpreting the encoding. Given that the statement says \"each letter with a unique emoji\", it's likely that each unique letter in the original message is replaced with a unique emoji. But this doesn't mean all instances of a letter are replaced; it might be a simple substitution cipher.\n\nActually, I think I need to be careful with my interpretation. It's possible that the encoding is that each occurrence of a specific letter (like 'a') is always replaced by the same specific emoji (like '😀'), but not every letter is replaced. Some letters appear as they are in the original text.\n\nBut another possibility is that each letter is replaced by a unique emoji, and what I'm seeing are placeholder characters or other characters that aren't letters.\n\nI think the simplest and most logical interpretation is that this is a substitution cipher, and some letters are replaced by emojis, while others remain unchanged. This is consistent with the hint that 😇 = e, which appears multiple times in the encoded message.\n\nBased on this understanding, let's re-analyze the message:\n\n\"su🥴s😇🤔u😇ntl🐷, 🤮n 🐼😇🥴🥶ua🥶🐷 1941, 600 🥺😇ws w😇🥶😇 s😇nt t🙄 🥴uc🤩😇nwal🐸 an🐸 maut🤩aus😇n c🙄nc😇nt🥶at🤮🙄n cam👽s.\"\n\nLooking at the context and the hint 😇 = e, the most logical interpretation for the sentence is:\n\n\"subsequently, in February 1941, 600 Jews were sent to Buchenwald and Mauthausen concentration camps.\"\n\nSo my deductions are:\n- 🥴 = b\n- 😇 = e (given)\n- 🤔 = q\n- 🐷 = y\n- 🤮 = i\n- 🐼 = F\n- 🥶 = r\n- 🥺 = J\n- 🙄 = o\n- 🤩 = h\n- 🐸 = d\n- 👽 = p\n\nI think this is the most coherent interpretation given the context. So the decoded message is:\n\n\"subsequently, in February 1941, 600 Jews were sent to Buchenwald and Mauthausen concentration camps.\"\n\nActually, given that I can replace these emojis with the actual characters, the encoded sentence becomes:\n\n\"subsequently, in February 1941, 600 Jews were sent to buchenwald and mauthausen concentration camps.\"\n\nThis makes sense historically, as Buchenwald and Mauthausen were Nazi concentration camps operative during World War II, and Jews were indeed sent to these camps in large numbers. The sentence is providing a tragic fact from the Holocaust.\n\nOne last check:\n\"su🥴s😇🤔u😇ntl🐷, 🤮n 🐼😇🥴🥶ua🥶🐷 1941, 600 🥺😇ws w😇🥶😇 s😇nt t🙄 🥴uc🤩😇nwal🐸 an🐸 maut🤩aus😇n c🙄nc😇nt🥶at🤮🙄n cam👽s.\"\n\nWith my substitutions:\n\"subsequently, in February 1941, 600 Jews were sent to buchenwald and mauthausen concentration camps.\"\n\nLooks correct. Here's the emoji to letter mapping:\n- 🥴 = b\n- 😇 = e (given)\n- 🤔 = q\n- 🐷 = y\n- 🤮 = i\n- 🐼 = F\n- 🥶 = r\n- 🥺 = J\n- 🙄 = o\n- 🤩 = h\n- 🐸 = d\n- 👽 = p\n\nThis is my final answer.\n\nActually, I just noticed there might be another issue. I've been assuming the letters \"s\", \"u\", \"n\", \"t\", \"l\", etc. in the encoded message are actual letters and not emojis. But this seems inconsistent with the statement that the message is encoded by replacing each letter with a unique emoji.\n\nHowever, I think I've been reading the encoded message incorrectly. The message is shown as:\n\n\"su🥴s😇🤔u😇ntl🐷, 🤮n 🐼😇🥴🥶ua🥶🐷 1941, 600 🥺😇ws w😇🥶😇 s😇nt t🙄 🥴uc🤩😇nwal🐸 an🐸 maut🤩aus😇n c🙄nc😇nt🥶at🤮🙄n cam👽s.\"\n\nIn this encoding:\n- The letters 's', 'u', and 't' are not replaced by emojis. They're the same in the encoded and decoded version.\n- But letters like 'e', 'i', 'b', etc. are replaced by emojis.\n\nGiven the pattern, it seems like only certain letters are replaced by emojis, not all.\n\nGiven the hint 😇 = e, I need to include that in my final answer. I'm also confident about the other emoji-to-letter mappings I've identified.\n\nSo my final answer is:\n- 🥴 = b\n- 😇 = e (given)\n- 🤔 = q\n- 🐷 = y\n- 🤮 = i\n- 🐼 = F\n- 🥶 = r\n- 🥺 = J\n- 🙄 = o\n- 🤩 = h\n- 🐸 = d\n- 👽 = p\n\nAs per the instructions, the last line of my response should be:\n\"Answer: 😇=e,🥴=b,🤔=q,🐷=y,🤮=i,🐼=F,🥶=r,🥺=J,🙄=o,🤩=h,🐸=d,👽=p\"# Crypto Word Game Analysis\n\nLooking at the encoded sentence:\n\"su🥴s😇🤔u😇ntl🐷, 🤮n 🐼😇🥴🥶ua🥶🐷 1941, 600 🥺😇ws w😇🥶😇 s😇nt t🙄 🥴uc🤩😇nwal🐸 an🐸 maut🤩aus😇n c🙄nc😇nt🥶at🤮🙄n cam👽s.\"\n\nI'm given the hint that 😇=e.

I'll try to identify some common English words and patterns.\n\nThe first word seems to be \"🤫o🤫o\". Given that we have \"o\" as the second and fourth letter, it's possible that the word is \"echo\" or \"polo\" or something similar. Let's consider 🤫 = c for now, as \"coco\" seems like a reasonable word.\n\nNext, we have \"a wa🤗 an\". If 🤗 = \"s\", this would become \"a was an\", which is a coherent phrase.\n\nMoving on, we have \"🐷🐔😴ortant\". If this is supposed to be \"important\", then 🐷 = i, 🐔 = m, and 😴 = p.\n\nLet's continue with these assumptions and see if they make sense:\ncomo a was an important com🐔oin in pre-colombian 🐔🤥merica.\n\nThe phrase \"como\" doesn't make immediate sense in this context, so my initial assumption for 🤫 might be wrong. Let's reconsider.\n\nIf 🤫 = s, then we'd have \"soso a was an important som🐔oin in pre-sombian 🐔🤥merica.\"\n\nThis still doesn't make complete sense. Let's try a different approach. The phrase \"an important\" suggests that the previous word is a noun. \n\nIf 🤫 = g, we'd have \"gogo a was an important gomgoin in pre-gombian 🐔🤥merica.\"\n\nStill doesn't sound right. Let's try 🤫 = t.\n\n\"toto a was an important tomtoin in pre-tombian 🐔🤥merica.\"\n\nThis is starting to sound closer. \"pre-tombian\" might be \"pre-Colombian\", which would make \"Colombia\" a significant historical region.\n\nIf that's the case, then 🐦 = u, 🙄 = m, and 🐷 = i.\n\nLet's refine our translation:\ntoto a was an important tomtoitt in pre-tomumian tmerica.\n\nStill not completely clear. Let's adjust our assumptions:\n\nIf 🤫 = c and 🐷 = i, then we'd have:\ncoco a was an important comcoitt in pre-columbian tmerica.\n\n\"coco\" could be \"Coco\", which might be a name or a reference to something. \n\nThe phrase \"pre-columbian\" suggests that this is referring to the historical period in the Americas before Columbus's arrival. \n\nWith this context, let's revise our letter assignments:\n🤫 = c\n🤩 = o (given)\n🤗 = s\n🐷 = i\n🐔 = m\n😴 = p\n🐯 = l\n😂 = y\n\nThe sentence would start to look like:\n\"coco a was an important commolit[?] in pre-columbian m[?]tast[?]rica.\"\n\nThe word \"commolit[?]\" seems like it might be \"commodity\". If that's the case, then:\n🐯 = d\n\nBut that would make the sentence:\n\"coco a was an important commodit[?] in pre-columbian m[?]tast[?]rica.\"\n\nThis still has some uncertainties. Let's try to identify more patterns.\n\nThe phrase \"pre-columbian\" suggests that we're discussing historical South or Central America. The part \"m[?]tast[?]rica\" could be \"mesoamerica\", which would fit the context.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n🤥 = e\n🐦 = u\n🙄 = m\n🐗 = s (though I don't see this in the encoded sentence)\n\nLet's revise our translations again:\n🤫 = c\n🤩 = o (given)\n🤗 = s\n🐷 = i\n🐔 = m\n😴 = p\n🐯 = d\n😂 = y\n🤥 = e\n🐦 = u\n🙄 = m\n\nThe sentence would then be:\n\"coco a was an important commodit[?] in pre-columbian mesoamerica.\"\n\nI've almost got the entire sentence. The last unknown part is the emoji represented by \"[?]\". Let's infer from context.\n\n\"commodit[?]\" is likely \"commodity\". So, if the remaining emoji is 😂, then 😂 = y.\n\nWith these updates, the sentence would read:\n\"coco a was an important commodity in pre-columbian mesoamerica.\"\n\nThis makes sense historically. Cacao (or cocoa) was indeed an important commodity in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. The Mayans and Aztecs used cocoa beans as currency and to make a beverage.\n\nWait, I think I misidentified the first word. If 🤫 = c, then the first word would be \"coco\", but the encoded sentence shows \"🤫🤩🤫🤩a\". That's a five-letter word, not \"coco\". \n\nAlternatively, if we're considering \"cocoa\" as the first word, then the next segment would be \"was an\". But the encoded segment is \"wa🤗 an\", which suggests that 🤗 might not be \"s\" as I initially assumed.\n\nLet's look at the entire sentence again:\n🤫🤩🤫🤩a wa🤗 an 🐷🐔😴ortant 🤫🤩🐔🐔o🐯🐷t😂 🐷n 😴r🤥-🤫ol🐦🐔🙄🐷an 🐔🤥🐗oa🐔🤥r🐷🤫a.\n\nIf I replace the known emojis with their corresponding letters using the above assignment:\ncoco? wa? an important commodity in pre-columbian me?oamerica.\n\nWait, I forgot that I still have the original encoded message to double-check. Let me reconsider by looking at the encoded sentence again:\n\nThe encoded sentence is:\n🤫🤩🤫🤩a wa🤗 an 🐷🐔😴🤩rtant 🤫🤩🐔🐔🤩🐯🐷t😂 🐷n 😴r🤥-🤫🤩l🐦🐔🙄🐷an 🐔🤥🐗🤩a🐔🤥r🐷🤫a.\n\nI notice that \"a\" appears without an emoji sometimes. This suggests that these aren't encoded, and they are actual \"a\"s.\n\nLet's reconsider the first word: 🤫🤩🤫🤩a. Given that 🤩 = o, this becomes ?o?oa. This could be \"cocoa\".\n\nGiven the context, \"cocoa was an important commodity in pre-columbian mesoamerica\" makes perfect sense. So, 🤫 = c.\n\nLet's verify the other emojis:\n- 🐷 appears in \"🐷🐔😴🤩rtant\" and later in \"🐷n\" and other places. If 🐷 = i, then we'd have \"important\" and \"in\", which fit.\n- 🐔 appears multiple times, and if 🐔 = m, we get \"important\", \"commodity\", and more, which makes sense.\n- 😴 appears in \"🐷🐔😴🤩rtant\" and \"😴r🤥-🤫🤩l🐦🐔🙄🐷an\". If 😴 = p, we get \"important\" and \"pre-columbian\", which is consistent.\n- 🐯 appears in what I believe is \"commodity\" (🤫🤩🐔🐔🤩🐯🐷t😂). If 🐯 = d, we get \"commodity\", which fits.\n- 😂 also appears in \"commodity\". If 😂 = y, that works too.\n- 🤥 appears in \"😴r🤥-🤫🤩l🐦🐔🙄🐷an\" and elsewhere. If 🤥 = e, we get \"pre-columbian\" and other words that make sense.\n- 🐦 and 🙄 appear in \"😴r🤥-🤫🤩l🐦🐔🙄🐷an\". If 🐦 = u and 🙄 = b, we'd have \"pre-columbian\", which is consistent with the historical context.\n\nWait, I think I misidentified 🙄. Given the context of \"pre-columbian\", if 🐦 = u, then 🙄 should be b.\n\nThere's also 🐗 in the encoded sentence, but I'm not seeing it clearly. Let me reread the encoded sentence:\n\nThe encoded sentence is:\n🤫🤩🤫🤩a wa🤗 an 🐷🐔😴🤩rtant 🤫🤩🐔🐔🤩🐯🐷t😂 🐷n 😴r🤥-🤫🤩l🐦🐔🙄🐷an 🐔🤥🐗🤩a🐔🤥r🐷🤫a.\n\nIt seems 🐗 appears in \"🐔🤥🐗🤩a🐔🤥r🐷🤫a\". If this is \"mesoamerica\", then 🐗 would be s.\n\nWait, let me be more careful here. Let me parse the encoded word by word.\n\n1. 🤫🤩🤫🤩a - If 🤫 = c and 🤩 = o, this word is \"cocoa\".\n2. wa🤗 - If 🤗 = s, this is \"was\".\n3. an - This is uncoded.\n4. 🐷🐔😴🤩rtant - If 🐷 = i, 🐔 = m, and 😴 = p, this is \"important\".\n5. 🤫🤩🐔🐔🤩🐯🐷t😂 - If 🤫 = c, 🤩 = o, 🐔 = m, 🐯 = d, 🐷 = i, and 😂 = y, this is \"commodity\".\n6. 🐷n - If 🐷 = i, this is \"in\".\n7. 😴r🤥-🤫🤩l🐦🐔🙄🐷an - If 😴 = p, 🤥 = e, 🤫 = c, 🤩 = o, 🐦 = u, 🐔 = m, 🙄 = b, and 🐷 = i, this is \"pre-columbian\".\n8. 🐔🤥🐗🤩a🐔🤥r🐷🤫a - Here I see a couple of possibilities. If this is \"mesoamerica\" (which fits the context), then 🐗 should be s. The decoding would be \"mesoamerica\" if 🐔 = m, 🤥 = e, 🐗 = s, 🤩 = o, 🐷 = i, and 🤫 = c. This looks right.\n\nLet's check the complete decoded sentence:\n\"Cocoa was an important commodity in pre-columbian mesoamerica.\"\n\nThis sentence makes perfect historical sense. Cocoa was indeed an important commodity in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, used both as currency and for making a beverage.\n\nSo, my final emoji-to-letter mapping is:\n🤫 = c\n🤩 = o (given)\n🤗 = s\n🐷 = i\n🐔 = m\n😴 = p\n🐯 = d\n😂 = y\n🤥 = e\n🐦 = u\n🙄 = b\n🐗 = s\n\nBut wait, I've assigned 🐗 = s, which is the same as 🤗 = s. Let me check the original encoded sentence again to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nActually, after reviewing the encoded sentence, I don't see any occurrence of 🐗. Let me check the specific word I was trying to decode:\n\n🐔🤥🐗🤩a🐔🤥r🐷🤫a\n\nAh, there's an issue here. I might have misunderstood or there might be a typo. Let me re-examine this word from the encoded sentence.\n\nThe encoded sentence is:\n🤫🤩🤫🤩a wa🤗 an 🐷🐔😴🤩rtant 🤫🤩🐔🐔🤩🐯🐷t😂 🐷n 😴r🤥-🤫🤩l🐦🐔🙄🐷an 🐔🤥🐗oa🐔🤥r🐷🤫a.\n\nI see the last word as \"🐔🤥🐗oa🐔🤥r🐷🤫a\". This seems even more perplexing. Let me re-read the encoded sentence carefully.\n\nOk, I'm re-reading the original encoded sentence:\n🤫🤩🤫🤩a wa🤗 an 🐷🐔😴🤩rtant 🤫🤩🐔🐔🤩🐯🐷t😂 🐷n 😴r🤥-🤫🤩l🐦🐔🙄🐷an 🐔🤥🐗🤩a🐔🤥r🐷🤫a.\n\nIt looks like I was reading correctly. So, in the word 🐔🤥🐗🤩a🐔🤥r🐷🤫a, there is indeed a 🐗, but also a non-encoded \"a\" in the middle. If this word is supposed to be \"mesoamerica\", then:\n\n🐔 = m\n🤥 = e\n🐗 = s\n🤩 = o (given)\na = a (not encoded)\n🐔 = m\n🤥 = e\nr = r (not encoded)\n🐷 = i\n🤫 = c\na = a (not encoded)\n\nThis looks better. It seems that some common letters like \"a\" and \"r\" aren't encoded in this game.\n\nSo, my revised emoji-to-letter mapping is:\n🤫 = c\n🤩 = o (given)\n🤗 = s\n🐷 = i\n🐔 = m\n😴 = p\n🐯 = d\n😂 = y\n🤥 = e\n🐦 = u\n🙄 = b\n🐗 = s\n\nBut now I have the issue of both 🤗 and 🐗 mapping to \"s\". Let me re-examine.\n\nLooking at the sentence, if I assume 🤗 = s and decode \"wa🤗\" as \"was\", then 🐗 must be a different letter. If the last word is \"mesoamerica\", and we already know 🐔 = m, 🤥 = e, 🐗 = ?, 🤩 = o (given), 🐷 = i, and 🤫 = c, then 🐗 should represent the \"s\" in \"mesoamerica\". But if 🤗 is also \"s\", then there's a conflict.\n\nLet's consider other possibilities.\n\nMaybe 🐗 = k or 🐗 = a or some other letter? If the last word is not \"mesoamerica\" but something similar, what could it be?\n\nActually, let's revisit the encoded sentence:\n🤫🤩🤫🤩a wa🤗 an 🐷🐔😴🤩rtant 🤫🤩🐔🐔🤩🐯🐷t😂 🐷n 😴r🤥-🤫🤩l🐦🐔🙄🐷an 🐔🤥🐗🤩a🐔🤥r🐷🤫a.\n\nActually let me analyze this again. I may have misidentified. I can see some parts are not coded as I had thought.\n\nLet's revisit my understanding. The encoded sentence is:\n🤫🤩🤫🤩a wa🤗 an 🐷🐔😴🤩rtant 🤫🤩🐔🐔🤩🐯🐷t😂 🐷n 😴r🤥-🤫🤩l🐦🐔🙄🐷an 🐔🤥🐗🤩a🐔🤥r🐷🤫a.\n\nThe hint is 🤩 = o.\n\nReplacing all occurrences of 🤩 with o, I get:\n🤫o🤫oa wa🤗 an 🐷🐔😴ortant 🤫o🐔🐔o🐯🐷t😂 🐷n 😴r🤥-🤫ol🐦🐔🙄🐷an 🐔🤥🐗oa🐔🤥r🐷🤫a.\n\nLooking at the first word, 🤫o🤫oa, if 🤫 = c, then the word is \"cocoa\".\n\nThe next segment, \"wa🤗 an\", could be \"was an\" if 🤗 = s.\n\nThe next word, 🐷🐔😴ortant, could be \"important\" if 🐷 = i, 🐔 = m, and 😴 = p.\n\nThe word after, 🤫o🐔🐔o🐯🐷t😂, would be \"commodity\" if 🤫 = c, 🐔 = m, 🐯 = d, 🐷 = i, and 😂 = y.\n\nNext, \"🐷n\" would be \"in\" if 🐷 = i.\n\nThe phrase \"😴r🤥-🤫ol🐦🐔🙄🐷an\" could be \"pre-columbian\" if 😴 = p, 🤥 = e, 🤫 = c, 🐦 = u, 🐔 = m, 🙄 = b, and 🐷 = i.\n\nFinally, 🐔🤥🐗oa🐔🤥r🐷🤫a. Given the historical context, this could be \"mesoamerica\" if 🐔 = m, 🤥 = e, 🐗 = s, 🐷 = i, and 🤫 = c.\n\nActually, let me relook at the entire word here.\n🐔🤥🐗oa🐔🤥r🐷🤫a\n\nWith our established decodings, this becomes: me?oamerica. The missing letter, represented by 🐗, should be \"s\" to form \"mesoamerica\". Thus, 🐗 = s.\n\nBut, earlier I had 🤗 = s for \"was\". I'm not sure if our game allows different emojis to represent the same letter, or if there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nActually, if I'm reading the sentence correctly from the encoded version, I see it as:\n\n🤫🤩🤫🤩a wa🤗 an 🐷🐔😴🤩rtant 🤫🤩🐔🐔🤩🐯🐷t😂 🐷n 😴r🤥-🤫🤩l🐦🐔🙄🐷an 🐔🤥🐗🤩a🐔🤥r🐷🤫a.\n\nI sometimes get a bit confused when reading back, but I do notice that in our phrase \"🐔🤥🐗🤩a🐔🤥r🐷🤫a\" there are multiple instances of \"a\" and there is a 🤩 which we know is \"o\". So this might be \"meso-america\" or something similar.\n\nActually, let's simplify this.\n\nThe last word, replacing the known and inferred letters, would be \"me? = 🐗)oamerica\", which should be \"mesoamerica\". This suggests 🐗 = s.\n\nBut earlier, we had 🤗 = s for the word \"wa🤗\" to be \"was\". \n\nHmm, this suggests either:\n1. I've misunderstood the encoding (which is possible).\n2. The game allows multiple emojis to represent the same letter (which seems a bit strange).\n3. One of my inferences is incorrect.\n\nOk, let me step back and rethink.\n\nMaybe the word \"wa🤗\" isn't \"was\" but something else. If 🤗 isn't \"s\", what could it be?\nIf the word is \"war\", then 🤗 = r. But \"Cocoa war an important commodity\" doesn't make sense.\n\nIf the word is \"wah\", then 🤗 = h. But that still doesn't make sense in context.\n\nAnother possibility is that the last word isn't \"mesoamerica\" but something else. If 🐗 isn't \"s\" but another letter, what could the word be?\n\nActually, one more possibility is that I've misread the encoded sentence.\n\nLet's check the encoding again: 🤫🤩🤫🤩a wa🤗 an 🐷🐔😴🤩rtant 🤫🤩🐔🐔🤩🐯🐷t😂 🐷n 😴r🤥-🤫🤩l🐦🐔🙄🐷an 🐔🤥🐗🤩a🐔🤥r🐷🤫a.\n\nI see. I can recheck where each emoji occurs. \n\nNow 🤗 also appears in \"wa🤗\". If this is supposed to be \"was\", then 🤗 = s. But if 🐗 is also supposed to be \"s\" in \"mesoamerica\" (if that's the last word), then we have a conflict.\n\nLet me reconsider the sentence within the historical context. Cocoa, or cacao, was indeed an important commodity in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. It was treated as a luxury item, and cacao beans were used as a form of currency. This historical fact aligns with the sentence I think I'm decoding.\n\nAlright, maybe I just misread the encoded. Let me try again.\n\nThe encoded sentence is:\n🤫🤩🤫🤩a wa🤗 an 🐷🐔😴🤩rtant 🤫🤩🐔🐔🤩🐯🐷t😂 🐷n 😴r🤥-🤫🤩l🐦🐔🙄🐷an 🐔🤥🐗🤩a🐔🤥r🐷🤫a.\n\nMaybe I can try to align the emojis better with positions in the sentence.\n\nOk, let me reread the rule again. The rule says:\n\n\"I will provide a sentence encoded by replacing each letter with a unique emoji.\" \n\nSo each emoji should represent a unique letter. And looking at the partial decoded sentence, I'm pretty confident that the sentence is:\n\n\"Cocoa was an important commodity in pre-columbian mesoamerica.\"\n\nHmm. So 🤗 and 🐗 cannot both be \"s\". But, given the sentence I'm decoding, one of them has to be \"s\". \n\nLet me reread the entire encoded sentence one more time: 🤫🤩🤫🤩a wa🤗 an 🐷🐔😴🤩rtant 🤫🤩🐔🐔🤩🐯🐷t😂 🐷n 😴r🤥-🤫🤩l🐦🐔🙄🐷an 🐔🤥🐗🤩a🐔🤥r🐷🤫a.\n\nActually, wait, if I'm missing things. In the word 🐷🐔😴🤩rtant, we assume 🐷=i, 🐔=m, 😴=p, and 🤩=o. That would decode to \"impo_tant\" (where \"_\" represents \"r\", which doesn't have an emoji). But in our context, it should be \"important\".\n\nSo, r doesn't have an emoji. \"r\" appears as just \"r\" in the encoded sentence.\n\nNow, let's refer back to the last word, 🐔🤥🐗🤩a🐔🤥r🐷🤫a. If \"r\" is not encoded, and we've established that 🐔 = m, 🤥 = e, 🐗 = s, 🤩 = o, 🐷 = i, and 🤫 = c, then this word decodes to \"mesoamerica\", which fits contextually.\n\nSo, it seems like not all letters are encoded by emojis. Some letters like \"a\" and \"r\" appear without encoding in the sentence.\n\nNow, let's revisit the issue with 🤗 and 🐗 both potentially representing \"s\". I noted that \"wa🤗\" would be \"was\" if 🤗 = s. But if \"a\" and \"r\" are not encoded, might there be other letters that are not encoded?\n\nLet's check the word \"an\" immediately after. It's represented as \"an\" in the encoded message without any emojis. This means that neither \"a\" nor \"n\" is encoded by emojis.\n\nNow, what if \"s\" is also not encoded by an emoji? Then, \"wa🤗\" might not be \"was\", but something else. But then, the context of the sentence would be lost.\n\nActually, I should re-read the encoded message one more time to be sure. The encoded message is: 🤫🤩🤫🤩a wa🤗 an 🐷🐔😴🤩rtant 🤫🤩🐔🐔🤩🐯🐷t😂 🐷n 😴r🤥-🤫🤩l🐦🐔🙄🐷an 🐔🤥🐗🤩a🐔🤥r🐷🤫a.\n\nHmm, there's something I might be missing. Why would only some letters of \"important\" be encoded and others not? Let me think...\n\nActually, the rule doesn't say that all letters are encoded. It says \"by replacing each letter with a unique emoji\". This could mean that only some letters are replaced, and those that are, each get a unique emoji.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misreading the encoded message. Let me remove spaces to isolate words better: 🤫🤩🤫🤩a wa🤗 an 🐷🐔😴🤩rtant 🤫🤩🐔🐔🤩🐯🐷t😂 🐷n 😴r🤥-🤫🤩l🐦🐔🙄🐷an 🐔🤥🐗🤩a🐔🤥r🐷🤫a.\n\nOk, so the word is \"🐷🐔😴🤩rtant\".\n\nIf 🐷=i, 🐔=m, 😴=p, and 🤩=o, then it's \"important\" with \"r\", \"t\", \"a\", \"n\", and the last \"t\" not encoded.\n\nGiven the rule \"by replacing each letter with a unique emoji\", I wonder if it means that for each unique letter in the sentence (a, b, c, etc.), there's a corresponding unique emoji. But it doesn't mean that every occurrence of a letter in the sentence is replaced; sometimes it appears in its regular form.\n\nThat's confusing. But, it's hard to make sense of the sentence otherwise. \n\nOk, if \"was\" is not encoded as \"wa🤗\", then what could it be? What letters of the alphabet could replace the 🤗 and make sense in the context?\n\n\"wat\": Cocoa wat an important... (doesn't make sense)\n\"wax\": Cocoa wax an important... (doesn't make sense)\n\"way\": Cocoa way an important... (doesn't fit contextually)\n\"waz\": Cocoa waz an important... (doesn't make sense)\n\nIt's hard to think of a sensible word other than \"was\" unless the context is very different from what I'm understanding.\n\nOne thing to also check: was the original sentence in all lowercase? If not, maybe some capital letters are encoded but their lowercase versions aren't.\n\nStill, the fact that \"was\" is \"wa🤗\" and not just \"was\" (without emoji) suggests to me that it's worth considering 🤗 = s.\n\nAnd since 🐗 appears in what I'm inferring to be \"mesoamerica\", and the letter it represents is likely \"s\", it seems that both 🤗 and 🐗 represent \"s\", which contradicts our initial rules.\n\nHow could this contradiction happen?\n\nMaybe it's because the original sentence is in the format \"Cocoa was an important commodity in pre-Colombian MesoAmerica\" and \"s\" in \"was\" is lowercase, and \"S\" in \"Meso...\" is uppercase?\n\nBut then, 🐷 seems to represent \"i\" both in \"important\" and \"in\", both of which are lowercase. The same applies to 🐔, which seems to represent \"m\" in both \"important\" and other places.\n\nIt's quite perplexing.\n\nLet's try another approach. If we ignore the possible context and consider the entire encoded string afresh, how could we interpret it?\n\nThe encoded sentence is:\n🤫🤩🤫🤩a wa🤗 an 🐷🐔😴🤩rtant 🤫🤩🐔🐔🤩🐯🐷t😂 🐷n 😴r🤥-🤫🤩l🐦🐔🙄🐷an 🐔🤥🐗🤩a🐔🤥r🐷🤫a.\n\nGiven hint: 🤩 = o\n\nReplacing: 🤫o🤫oa wa🤗 an 🐷🐔😴ortant 🤫o🐔🐔o🐯🐷t😂 🐷n 😴r🤥-🤫ol🐦🐔🙄🐷an 🐔🤥🐗oa🐔🤥r🐷🤫a.\n\nIt seems like some letters are consistently not encoded:\n- 'a' in \"cocoa\", \"an\", etc.\n- 'r' in \"important\", \"-columbian\", etc.\n- 'n' in \"an\", \"important\", etc.\n- 't' in \"important\", \"commodity\", etc.\n\nSo the rule might be that not all letters are encoded by emojis; some appear as themselves.\n\nLooking at patterns of encoded letters:\n- 🤫 appears in \"cocoa\", \"commodity\", \"-columbian\", suggesting 🤫 = c.\n- 🐷 appears in \"important\", \"in\", \"commodity\", suggesting 🐷 = i.\n- 🐔 appears in \"important\", \"commodity\", \"columbian\", suggesting 🐔 = m.\n- etc.\n\nOk, I'll map emojis consistently:\n\n🤫 = c\n🤩 = o (given)\n🤗 = s (based on \"was\")\n🐷 = i\n🐔 = m\n😴 = p\n🐯 = d\n😂 = y\n🤥 = e\n🐦 = u\n🙄 = b\n\nFor 🐗, if it's also \"s\" in \"mesoamerica\", I could rationalize some scenarios:\n1. There's a typo or inconsistency in the game.\n2. The rule might be more complex, allowing multiple emojis for the same letter in certain contexts.\n3. I'm misunderstanding the rules or the format.\n\nBut given the context and how the rest of the mapping makes consistent sense, I think 🐗 = s makes the most sense. So, there might be an issue with having both 🤗 and 🐗 represent the same letter, \"s\", but that seems like the most plausible interpretation given the provided information.\n\nSo in summary:\n🤫 = c\n🤩 = o (given)\n🐷 = i\n🐔 = m\n😴 = p\n🐯 = d\n😂 = y\n🤥 = e\n🐦 = u\n🙄 = b\n🤗 = s\n🐗 = s (though it's inconsistent with 🤗 = s)\n\nSo based on my analysis:\n🤫=c\n🤩=o\n🤗=s\n🐷=i\n🐔=m\n😴=p\n🐯=d\n😂=y\n🤥=e\n🐦=u\n🙄=b\n🐗=s\n\nI will go with this, even though it's strange that 🤗 and 🐗 both represent \"s\".\n\nThe requested format is 'emoji=word'. I think they're asking for 'emoji=letter'. I'll list my answers in this format:\n\n🤫=c\n🤩=o\n🤗=s\n🐷=i\n🐔=m\n😴=p\n🐯=d\n😂=y\n🤥=e\n🐦=u\n🙄=b\n🐗=sLooking at the encoded sentence, I need to decode the emojis to letters to reveal the original sentence.\n\nThe sentence provided is:\n🤫🤩🤫🤩a wa🤗 an 🐷🐔😴🤩rtant 🤫🤩🐔🐔🤩🐯🐷t😂 🐷n 😴r🤥-🤫🤩l🐦🐔🙄🐷an 🐔🤥🐗🤩a🐔🤥r🐷🤫a.\n\nWith the hint 🤩=o, I'll substitute this and look for patterns:\n🤫o🤫oa wa🤗 an 🐷🐔😴ortant 🤫o🐔🐔o🐯🐷t😂 🐷n 😴r🤥-🤫ol🐦🐔🙄🐷an 🐔🤥🐗oa🐔🤥r🐷🤫a.\n\nI notice that several letters appear without emojis (a, n, r, t), while others are consistently encoded.

But since we already assigned 🐮 = 'f', 😇 is likely 'w'.\n\nLet's review our assignments:\n- 🐯 = a (given)\n- 🥶 = o (guess)\n- 🐷 = i (guess)\n- 🐼 = n (guess)\n- 🤫 = l (guess)\n- 🤓 = c (guess)\n- 🐦 = y (guess)\n- 🐮 = f (guess)\n- 😇 = w (guess)\n\nLet's verify if these assignments make sense in the original encoded sentence:\n\"the most dominant males an collect as many as 15 - 20 females to mate with.\"\n\nThe sentence seems coherent with these guesses, but let's double-check for any inconsistencies:\n- \"males an collect\" doesn't make grammatical sense. \"an\" should be \"can\", but that would make 🐼 both 'n' and 'c', which is inconsistent.\n- Maybe I misinterpreted something. Let's rethink.\n\nIf \"an\" is not \"an\" but part of another word, then it could be:\n- \"males and collect\"\n- \"males are collect\"\n\n\"males are collect\" doesn't make sense grammatically.\n\"males and collect\" would mean 🐼 = 'd', which contradicts our earlier guess of 🐼 = 'n'.\n\nLet's go back to the encoded sentence and reassess:\n\"the m🥶st d🥶m🐷🐼a🐼t ma🤫es a🐼 a🥶🤫🤫e🤓t as ma🐼🐦 as 15 - 20 🐮ema🤫es t🥶 mate 😇a🐷th.\"\n\nI need to reconsider my interpretations. Let's break it down word by word:\n1. \"the\" - clear.\n2. \"m🥶st\" - still likely \"most\", so 🥶 = 'o'.\n3. \"d🥶m🐷🐼a🐼t\" - still likely \"dominant\", reinforcing 🥶 = 'o', 🐷 = 'i', 🐼 = 'n'.\n4. \"ma🤫es\" - with 🤫 guessed as 'l', this would be \"males\", which fits.\n5. \"a🐼\" - with 🐼 = 'n', this would be \"an\", which doesn't seem to connect grammatically.\n6. \"a🥶🤫🤫e🤓t\" - let's reconsider. If 🥶 = 'o', 🤫 = 'l', and we don't have a guess for 🤓 yet, this might be \"allect\" or \"ollect\", neither of which is a common word. Let's keep this uncertain.\n7. \"as\" - clear.\n8. \"ma🐼🐦\" - with 🐼 = 'n' and 🐦 = 'y', this would be \"many\", which makes sense.\n9. \"as\" - clear.\n10. \"15 - 20\" - clear.\n11. \"🐮ema🤫es\" - with 🐮 = 'f' and 🤫 = 'l', this would be \"females\", which is fitting.\n12. \"t🥶\" - with 🥶 = 'o', this would be \"to\", clear.\n13. \"mate\" - clear.\n14. \"😇a🐷th\" - with 😇 as an unknown and 🐷 = 'i', this might be \"with\", suggesting 😇 = 'w'.\n\nSo, the reconstructed sentence would be: \"the most dominant males an ??? as many as 15 - 20 females to mate with.\"\n\nThe uncertain part is \"a🐼 a🥶🤫🤫e🤓t\". If we consider the context about dominant males, females, and mating, it might be related to a behavior or characteristic. If 🐼 = 'n', 🥶 = 'o', and 🤫 = 'l', then it might be \"an ollect\". This doesn't make sense.\n\nLet's reconsider. Maybe 🤫 isn't 'l' but another letter, or maybe 🐼 isn't 'n'.\n\nThe context suggests something about mating behavior of dominant males. The sentence might be saying that dominant males attract or collect many females to mate with.\n\nLet's try:\n\"the most dominant males are collect as many as 15 - 20 females to mate with.\" - This still doesn't sound right.\n\"the most dominant males can collect as many as 15 - 20 females to mate with.\" - This sounds much better, suggesting 🐼 = 'c'.\n\nBut if 🐼 = 'c', then \"d🥶m🐷🐼a🐼t\" would be \"domicat\", which doesn't make sense.\n\nI'm going to reset my analysis and try a different approach. Given 🐯 = a, I'll focus on the pattern of the word \"dominant\" to see if it fits:\n\n\"d🥶m🐷🐼a🐼t\" - if this is \"dominant\", then 🥶 = 'o', 🐷 = 'i', 🐼 = 'n'.\n\n\"ma🤫es\" - if 🤫 = 'l', this is \"males\".\n\n\"a🐼\" - if 🐼 = 'n', this is \"an\". It could be part of a phrase like \"an ideal\" or \"an opportunity\".\n\n\"a🥶🤫🤫e🤓t\" - if 🥶 = 'o' and 🤫 = 'l', this might be \"collect\" or \"correct\". If it's \"collect\", then 🤓 = 'c'.\n\nBut if 🤓 = 'c', then \"a🐼\" would be \"ac\", which isn't a common word or prefix. So there might be an inconsistency here.\n\nLet's redo this analysis.\n\nThe hint says 🐯 = a. Let's go through the sentence and substitute:\n\n\"the m🥶st d🥶m🐷🐼a🐼t ma🤫es a🐼 a🥶🤫🤫e🤓t as ma🐼🐦 as 15 - 20 🐮ema🤫es t🥶 mate 😇a🐷th.\"\n\nReplacing 🐯 with a:\n\"the m🥶st d🥶m🐷🐼a🐼t ma🤫es a🐼 a🥶🤫🤫e🤓t as ma🐼🐦 as 15 - 20 🐮ema🤫es t🥶 mate 😇a🐷th.\"\n\nNow, let's count the frequency of each emoji:\n- 🥶: 3 times\n- 🐷: 2 times\n- 🐼: 4 times\n- 🤫: 3 times\n- 🤓: 2 times\n- 🐦: 1 time\n- 🐮: 1 time\n- 😇: 1 time\n\nThe most frequent emojis are 🐼, 🥶, and 🤫. In English, common letters are e, t, a, o, i, n, s, h, r, d, l, u. Given the context of mating behavior, let's guess what some of the words might be.\n\nIf we assume \"the most dominant males\", then:\n- 🥶 would be 'o'\n- 🐷 would be 'i'\n- 🐼 would be 'n'\n- 🤫 would be 'l'\n\nLet's continue with the sentence to see if these guesses are consistent:\n\"the most dominant males an collect as many as 15 - 20 females to mate with.\"\n\nI notice a potential mismatch: \"an collect\" doesn't make grammatical sense. If 🐼 is 'n', then a🐼 is \"an\", which doesn't fit.\n\nLet's revisit the encoded sentence:\n\"the m🥶st d🥶m🐷🐼a🐼t ma🤫es a🐼 a🥶🤫🤫e🤓t as ma🐼🐦 as 15 - 20 🐮ema🤫es t🥶 mate 😇a🐷th.\"\n\nIf I look at \"a🐼\" in isolation, it might be \"an\", \"at\", \"as\", etc. But in the context, it might be part of a phrase or a different word.\n\nLet's rethink. I want to ensure the sentence makes logical sense in the context of mating behavior.\n\n\"the most dominant males ... collect as many as 15 - 20 females to mate with.\"\n\nThe missing word after \"males\" and before \"collect\" should be a connecting word, possibly a conjunction, a modal verb, or similar. Common candidates would be:\n- can\n- may\n- will\n- do\n\nIf a🐼 is \"can\", then 🐼 would be 'c'. But this would contradict our earlier guess of 🐼 = 'n' based on \"dominant\".\n\nOh, I see the issue. If 🐼 = 'n', then \"d🥶m🐷🐼a🐼t\" would be \"dominant\", but this makes \"a🐼\" as \"an\", which doesn't fit in the context: \"males an collect\".\n\nMaybe the word isn't \"dominant\" but something else? Let's consider other words that might fit the pattern \"d🥶m🐷🐼a🐼t\".\n\nActually, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try a simple approach and see what words naturally fit in the context.\n\nIf I replace the emojis with underscores, we get:\n\"the m_st d_m_na_t ma_es a_ a__e_t as ma_y as 15 - 20 _ema_es t_ mate _a_th.\"\n\nIt seems clear that we're discussing mating behavior, and I think the sentence is describing the mating behaviors of dominant males.\n\n\"the most dominant males [something] as many as 15 - 20 females to mate with.\"\n\nThe missing part is \"a_ a__e_t\". It might be \"will attract\", \"can attract\", or similar. Given that a_ might be \"an\", it might be \"an amount\", \"an extent\", or something similar.\n\nI'm going to guess the following:\n- 🥶 = o\n- 🐷 = i\n- 🐼 = n\n- 🤫 = l\n- 🤓 = c\n- 🐦 = y\n- 🐮 = f\n- 😇 = w\n\nAnd the sentence would read:\n\"the most dominant males an collect as many as 15 - 20 females to mate with.\"\n\nStill, there's something odd about \"an collect\". Let's reconsider.\n\nThe more I think about it, if a🐼 is \"an\", there should be a noun after it, not a verb. So, it might be \"an amount\", \"an extent\", etc. Given the context, it could be \"an amount of\" or \"an extent that\".\n\nHmm, but that doesn't clearly fit with the encoded sequence. Let me keep thinking.\n\nWait, if a🐼 is \"an\", and a🥶🤫🤫e🤓t is \"amount\" or \"extent\", then:\n- a🥶 would be \"am\" or \"ex\", which would make 🥶 = 'm' or 🥶 = 'x'.\n- 🤫🤫e would be \"oun\" or \"ten\", which are inconsistent.\n\nI might be forcing interpretations here. Let's approach this more methodically.\n\nFirst, let's focus on definitive patterns:\n- 🐯 = a (given)\n\nWith \"the\" spelled out, the next word is \"m🥶st\", which is likely \"most\". So, 🥶 = o.\n\nThe next word is \"d🥶m🐷🐼a🐼t\". If 🥶 = o, it would be \"dom🐷🐼a🐼t\". This looks very much like \"dominant\", suggesting 🐷 = i and 🐼 = n.\n\nThe next word is \"ma🤫es\". Common words that fit are \"males\", \"makes\", \"mates\". Given the context, \"males\" seems most fitting, suggesting 🤫 = l.\n\nNow, the next segment is \"a🐼 a🥶🤫🤫e🤓t\". With 🐼 = n and 🥶 = o, this would be \"an a🥶🤫🤫e🤓t\". So far this matches with the start of the my guesses.\n\nIf 🥶 = o and 🤫 = l, then a🥶🤫🤫e🤓t would be \"aollect\". This doesn't seem like a valid word in English, so I'm thinking that I might have made a mistake in my guesses. \n\nLet's consider a different approach to this segment. If a🐼 is on its own, and the next word starts with a🥶🤫🤫e🤓t, then a🐼 is \"will\", \"can\", or another auxiliary. But if 🐼 = n, then a🐼 is \"an\", which doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's try a slight change to our guess. What if 🐼 isn't 'n' but 'r'? Then \"d🥶m🐷🐼a🐼t\" would be \"domirart\", which doesn't seem right, plus it would make a🐼 as \"ar\", which isn't a common word either.\n\nAlright, let's rethink from the beginning. If the pattern of the sentence is:\n\"the most dominant males [something] as many as 15 - 20 females to mate with.\"\n\nThen the [something] should be a verb or a verb phrase, possibly with a modal or auxiliary. Given the likely letters we've assigned, it would be \"a🐼 a🥶🤫🤫e🤓t\".\n\nIf 🐼 = n, 🥶 = o, 🤫 = l, and 🤓 = c (based on our guesses), this would be \"an collect\". This doesn't make grammatical sense, though.\n\nWait, maybe a🐼 isn't a standalone word. It might be the first two letters of a longer word. For instance, if the word is \"and\", then 🐼 would be 'n'. But then the next word would start with a🥶, which doesn't align with the encoding.\n\nLet's revisit the encoded sentence one more time:\n\"the m🥶st d🥶m🐷🐼a🐼t ma🤫es a🐼 a🥶🤫🤫e🤓t as ma🐼🐦 as 15 - 20 🐮ema🤫es t🥶 mate 😇a🐷th.\"\n\nWith our current guesses:\n- 🐯 = a (given)\n- 🥶 = o (guessed)\n- 🐷 = i (guessed)\n- 🐼 = n (guessed)\n- 🤫 = l (guessed)\n\nThis would give:\n\"the most dominant males an aollect as many as 15 - 20 females to mate with.\"\n\nThe only part that doesn't make sense is \"an aollect\". It's possible that I misunderstood the segmentation of the encoded sentence. Let's revisit:\n\"... ma🤫es a🐼 a🥶🤫🤫e🤓t ...\"\n\nMaybe it's not meant to be \"males an aollect\" but \"male san aollect\" or \"males ana ollect\", but that doesn't seem right either.\n\nGiven our guesses, let's explore the possibility that \"aollect\" is a misspelled or archaic form of \"collect\". In that case, it might be saying \"the most dominant males an collect as many as 15 - 20 females to mate with.\" Maybe the 'c' got replaced by an 'a', and it should be \"males can collect\"? Actually, that fits the context and grammar. \n\nSo, new hypothesis:\n- 🐼 might not be 'n' but 'c', and 🥶 is definitely 'a'.\n\nBut that would mean \"d🥶m🐷🐼a🐼t\" would be \"domicact\" if 🥶 = o, 🐷 = i, and 🐼 = c, which doesn't make sense.\n\nLet's rethink some of our assumptions.\n\nIf we focus on \"ma🤫es\", with 🤫 = l, this would be \"males\", which makes contextual sense.\n\n\"d🥶m🐷🐼a🐼t\" is likely \"dominant\", suggesting 🥶 = o, 🐷 = i, and 🐼 = n.\n\nBut that would make \"a🐼\" as \"an\", which doesn't fit in \"males an aollect\".\n\nWait, maybe \"a🐼\" and \"a🥶🤫🤫e🤓t\" are not two separate words. It might be one longer word like \"anallect\" or \"ancollect\".\n\nBut \"anallect\" or \"ancollect\" don't seem to be common English words either.\n\nHmm, so for now I stick with:\n- 🐯 = a (given)\n- 🥶 = o (guessed)\n- 🐷 = i (guessed)\n- 🐼 = n (guessed)\n- 🤫 = l (guessed)\n- 🤓 = c (guessed)\n- 🐦 = y (guessed)\n- 🐮 = f (guessed)\n- 😇 = w (guessed)\n\nAnd the sentence would be:\n\"the most dominant males an collect as many as 15 - 20 females to mate with.\"\n\nEven though I'm not 100% sure about the \"an collect\" part, it's the most coherent interpretation so far, and I admit I may have missed a better fit. Let's finalize this for now.\n\nOK, so my guesses are:\n- 🥶 = o\n- 🐷 = i\n- 🐼 = n\n- 🤫 = l\n- 🤓 = c\n- 🐦 = y\n- 🐮 = f\n- 😇 = w\n\nWith the given hint:\n- 🐯 = a\n\nSo my answer is:\n🥶=o, 🐷=i, 🐼=n, 🤫=l, 🤓=c, 🐦=y, 🐮=f, 😇=w, 🐯=a# Analysis of the Encoded Sentence\n\nLooking at the encoded sentence:\n\"the m🥶st d🥶m🐷🐼🐯🐼t m🐯🤫es 🤓🐯🐼 🤓🥶🤫🤫e🤓t 🐯s m🐯🐼🐦 🐯s 15 - 20 🐮em🐯🤫es t🥶 m🐯te 😇🐷th.\"\n\nGiven hint: 🐯 = a\n\nFirst, I'll replace this known letter:\n\"the m🥶st d🥶m🐷🐼a🐼t ma🤫es 🤓a🐼 🤓🥶🤫🤫e🤓t as ma🐼🐦 as 15 - 20 🐮ema🤫es t🥶 mate 😇a🐷th.\"\n\nLooking at the patterns and context of this sentence, it appears to be about mating behavior. I'll make educated guesses for each emoji:\n\n1. \"m🥶st\" is likely \"most\", suggesting 🥶 = o\n2. \"d🥶m🐷🐼a🐼t\" with 🥶 = o would be \"dom🐷🐼a🐼t\" - this looks like \"dominant\", so 🐷 = i and 🐼 = n\n3. \"ma🤫es\" is likely \"males\", making 🤫 = l\n4. \"🤓a🐼\" with 🐼 = n would be \"🤓an\", which is likely \"can\", making 🤓 = c\n5. \"🤓🥶🤫🤫e🤓t\" with 🤓 = c, 🥶 = o, 🤫 = l would be \"collect\"\n6. \"ma🐼🐦\" with 🐼 = n would be \"man🐦\", likely \"many\", making 🐦 = y\n7. \"🐮ema🤫es\" is likely \"females\", making 🐮 = f\n8. \"😇a🐷th\" with 🐷 = i would be \"😇aith\", likely \"with\", making 😇 = w\n\nWith these substitutions, the sentence becomes:\n\"the most dominant males can collect as many as 15 - 20 females to mate with.\"\n\nThis makes perfect sense in the context of animal mating behavior.\n\nAnswer: 🐯=a,🥶=o,🐷=i,🐼=n,🤫=l,🤓=c,🐦=y,🐮=f,😇=w"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

I'm told that 🐭 = s. Let me analyze the encoded sentence and try to deduce what the other emojis might represent.\n\nFirst, let's identify the pattern of the encoded sentence:\n\n```\nhe ha🐭 al🐭o a🧐🧐ea😎ed 🐹🥵 ma🥵y h🐹🐦hly-accla🐹med telev🐹🐭🐹o🥵 d😎ama🐭 🐭uch a🐭 the lake🐭, 🐭tate o🤧 🧐lay a🥵d two 🦆a🤧ta awa😎d-w🐹🥵🥵🐹🥵🐦 🐭e😎🐹al🐭; clock🐹🥵🐦 o🤧🤧 a🥵d 🐭e🐰 t😎a🤧🤧🐹c.\n```\n\nGiven that 🐭 = s, I'll substitute that in and see if we can get some clearer patterns:\n\n```\nhe has also a🧐🧐ea😎ed 🐹🥵 ma🥵y h🐹🐦hly-accla🐹med telev🐹s🐹o🥵 d😎amas such as the lakes, state o🤧 🧐lay a🥵d two 🦆a🤧ta awa😎d-w🐹🥵🥵🐹🥵🐦 se😎🐹als; clock🐹🥵🐦 o🤧🤧 a🥵d se🐰 t😎a🤧🤧🐹c.\n```\n\nNow let's try to deduce some of the other emojis based on common English patterns and the context.\n\n1. \"he has also a🧐🧐ea😎ed\" - The word after \"also\" likely starts with \"appeared\". So 🧐 might be 'p' and 😎 might be 'r'.\n\n2. \"🐹🥵\" - This is likely a common two-letter word. Given the context, it's probably \"in\".\n\n3. \"ma🥵y\" - If 🥵 is 'n', this would be \"many\".\n\n4. \"h🐹🐦hly-accla🐹med\" - If 🐹 is 'i', this would be \"highly-acclaimed\".\n\nLet's make these substitutions and see:\n\n```\nhe has also appeared in many highly-acclaimed television dramas such as the lakes, state of play and two 🦆afta award-winning serials; clocking off and se🐰 traffic.\n```\n\nThe word \"🦆afta\" is probably \"bafta\" (British Academy of Film and Television Arts).\n\nThe sentence is starting to make sense now. Let's continue with a few more guesses:\n\n5. \"o🤧\" - This is likely \"of\".\n\n6. \"se🐰 traffic\" - This could be \"sex traffic\", making 🐰 = 'x'.\n\nLet's see where we stand:\n\n```\nhe has also appeared in many highly-acclaimed television dramas such as the lakes, state of play and two bafta award-winning serials; clocking off and sex traffic.\n```\n\nThis seems to be making sense. Let's finalize our guesses:\n\n🐭 = s (given)\n🐹 = i\n🥵 = n\n😎 = r\n🧐 = p\n🤧 = f\n🦆 = b\n🐰 = x\n🐦 = g\n🐹 = i\n\nNow, let's double-check our answers and see if there are any inconsistencies:\n\n🐭 = s\n🐹 = i\n🥵 = n\n😎 = r\n🧐 = p\n🤧 = f\n🦆 = b\n🐰 = x\n🐦 = g\n\nWait, I've listed 🐹 = i twice. Let me go through the sentence again to ensure all my assignments are consistent.\n\n\"he has also appeared in many highly-acclaimed television dramas such as the lakes, state of play and two bafta award-winning serials; clocking off and sex traffic.\"\n\nHmm, there seems to be some inconsistency. Let me go through the original sentence again, this time focusing on each emoji individually:\n\n🐭 = s (given)\n🧐 = p (from \"ap🧐eared\")\n😎 = r (from \"appea😎ed\")\n🐹 = i (from \"h🐹ghly\")\n🥵 = n (from \"ma🥵y\")\n🐦 = g (from \"hi🐦hly\")\n🤧 = f (from \"o🤧\")\n🦆 = b (from \"🦆afta\")\n🐰 = x (from \"se🐰\")\n\nThis looks more consistent.

Let me check the original again and identify any emojis I haven't assigned yet.\n\nOn further inspection, I noticed \"a🧐🧐ea😎ed\". If 🧐 = p and 😎 = r, this would be \"appealed\", but I had guessed it as \"appeared\". Let me check if there are other instances of 🧐 in the sentence to confirm.\n\nI see \"🧐lay\", which would be \"play\" if 🧐 = p. This seems consistent with my guess.\n\nThe sentence also has \"d😎amas\", which would be \"dramas\" if 😎 = r, which matches my guess.\n\nNow, the segment \"state o🤧 🧐lay\" would be \"state of play\" with 🤧 = f and 🧐 = p. This is a valid English phrase.\n\nSo, my guesses so far are:\n\n🐭 = s (given)\n🧐 = p\n😎 = r\n🐹 = i\n🥵 = n\n🐦 = g\n🤧 = f\n🦆 = b\n🐰 = x\n\nLet me check if I've missed any other emojis:\n\n\"he has also appeared in many highly-acclaimed television dramas such as the lakes, state of play and two bafta award-winning serials; clocking off and sex traffic.\"\n\nHmm, I don't think the sentence is \"lakes\" but rather \"Late's\" as in \"The Late's Show\". Let me double-check the original:\n\n\"he has also appeared in many highly-acclaimed television dramas such as the lakes, state of play and two bafta award-winning serials; clocking off and sex traffic.\"\n\nActually, \"lakes\" could be a valid show name. Let's continue with that interpretation for now.\n\nNow, if I read through the sentence with my current assignments, it sounds like it's describing someone's television appearances, which makes sense.\n\nActually, \"the lakes\" could be a television drama series. And \"state of play\" and \"sex traffic\" are also known television dramas. \"Clocking off\" might be another TV show.\n\nSo, the sentence seems to be describing someone's appearances in various television dramas.\n\nI'm pretty confident in my current emoji-to-letter mappings. Let's summarize:\n\n🐭 = s (given)\n🧐 = p\n😎 = r\n🐹 = i\n🥵 = n\n🐦 = g\n🤧 = f\n🦆 = b\n🐰 = x\n\nThese are the emojis I've identified so far. There might be more in the original sentence, but these are the ones I've been able to deduce based on the context.\n\nI'll submit these as my answer for this round.\n\nLet me make sure I didn't miss any emojis from the original encoded sentence.\n\nOriginal: \n```\nhe ha🐭 al🐭o a🧐🧐ea😎ed 🐹🥵 ma🥵y h🐹🐦hly-accla🐹med telev🐹🐭🐹o🥵 d😎ama🐭 🐭uch a🐭 the lake🐭, 🐭tate o🤧 🧐lay a🥵d two 🦆a🤧ta awa😎d-w🐹🥵🥵🐹🥵🐦 🐭e😎🐹al🐭; clock🐹🥵🐦 o🤧🤧 a🥵d 🐭e🐰 t😎a🤧🤧🐹c.\n```\n\nI indeed missed some repeats, but the emojis I've identified should be correct. Let me add any I missed:\n🐭 = s (given)\n🧐 = p\n😎 = r\n🐹 = i\n🥵 = n\n🐦 = g\n🤧 = f\n🦆 = b\n🐰 = x\n\nActually, thinking it through again, I'm not entirely sure if 🧐 is 'p' because \"appealed\" is also a valid word. Let me check if there's additional context within the sentence.\n\n\"he has also a🧐🧐ea😎ed in many highly-acclaimed television dramas such as the lakes, state of 🧐lay and two bafta award-winning serials; clocking off and sex traffic.\"\n\nIf 🧐 is 'p', then the phrase would be \"state of play\", which is a known TV drama. This supports my guess that 🧐 = p.\n\nWith this in mind, I think I'm sticking with my original guesses:\n\n🐭 = s (given)\n🧐 = p\n😎 = r\n🐹 = i\n🥵 = n\n🐦 = g\n🤧 = f\n🦆 = b\n🐰 = x\n\nLet me submit these as my answer for this round.# Crypto Word Game Analysis\n\nLooking at the encoded sentence, I'll start by applying the hint that 🐭 = s and then analyze the text to decode other emojis.\n\nStarting with the substitution:\n```\nhe has also a🧐🧐ea😎ed 🐹🥵 ma🥵y h🐹🐦hly-accla🐹med telev🐹s🐹o🥵 d😎amas such as the lakes, state o🤧 🧐lay a🥵d two 🦆a🤧ta awa😎d-w🐹🥵🥵🐹🥵🐦 se😎🐹als; clock🐹🥵🐦 o🤧🤧 a🥵d se🐰 t😎a🤧🤧🐹c.\n```\n\nLooking at patterns and common words:\n\n- \"he has also a🧐🧐ea😎ed\" - This looks like \"appeared\" where 🧐 = p and 😎 = r\n- \"🐹🥵\" - This is likely \"in\" where 🐹 = i and 🥵 = n\n- \"h🐹🐦hly-accla🐹med\" - If 🐹 = i and 🐦 = g, we get \"highly-acclaimed\"\n- \"o🤧 🧐lay\" - This is likely \"of play\" where 🤧 = f\n- \"🦆a🤧ta\" - This is \"bafta\" where 🦆 = b\n- \"se🐰 t😎a🤧🤧🐹c\" - Likely \"sex traffic\" where 🐰 = x\n\nThe sentence appears to be about someone who has appeared in many acclaimed television dramas including \"The Lakes,\" \"State of Play,\" award-winning serials, \"Clocking Off,\" and \"Sex Traffic.\"\n\n## My Answer\n\nAnswer: 🐭=s,🧐=p,😎=r,🐹=i,🥵=n,🐦=g,🤧=f,🦆=b,🐰=x"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Let me search for it again... actually I'm pretty sure there's no 🐰 in the sentence.

I probably made an error earlier.\n\nLet me verify the emoji-to-letter mapping I've deduced:\n🐨 = a\n🐶 = r\n🤔 = t\n👻 = f\n🥺 = d\n🐮 = l\n\nI also noticed one more emoji I missed earlier: 🐰. But upon careful review, I don't see it in the sentence. Let me also check for 🐶:\n\nIn the word \"appe🐶s\", 🐶 = r.\nIn the word \"co🐶e\", 🐶 = r.\nIn the word \"f🐶om\", 🐶 = r.\nIn the word \"la🐶ge🐶\", 🐶 = r.\nIn the word \"diffe🐶entiated\", 🐶 = r.\nIn the word \"pa🐶ent\", 🐶 = r.\n\nAll of these are consistent with 🐶 = r.\n\nLet me also double-check for 🐰 again, this time more thoroughly by looking at each word:\n\"psyche\" - no emojis\n\"🐨ppe🐨🐶s\" - 🐨 (a), 🐶 (r)\n\"🤔o\" - 🤔 (t)\n\"be\" - no emojis\n\"🐨\" - 🐨 (a)\n\"genuine\" - no emojis\n\"c🐨se\" - 🐨 (a)\n\"o👻\" - 👻 (f)\n\"🐨n\" - 🐨 (a)\n\"expose🥺\" - 🥺 (d)\n\"me🤔🐨🐮🐮ic\" - 🤔 (t), 🐨 (a), 🐮 (l), 🐮 (l)\n\"co🐶e\" - 🐶 (r)\n\"👻🐶om\" - 👻 (f), 🐶 (r)\n\"🐨\" - 🐨 (a)\n\"🐮🐨🐶ge🐶\" - 🐮 (l), 🐨 (a), 🐶 (r), 🐶 (r)\n\"🥺i👻👻e🐶en🤔i🐨🤔e🥺\" - 🥺 (d), 👻 (f), 👻 (f), 🐶 (r), 🤔 (t), 🐨 (a), 🤔 (t), 🥺 (d)\n\"p🐨🐶en🤔\" - 🐨 (a), 🐶 (r), 🤔 (t)\n\"bo🥺y\" - 🥺 (d)\n\nI was right; there's no 🐰 in the sentence. I'm not sure why I thought there was.\n\nNow, let's double-check the sentence with my decoding:\nWith 🐨 = a, 🐶 = r, 🤔 = t, 👻 = f, 🥺 = d, 🐮 = l:\n\n\"psyche appears to be a genuine case of an exposed metallic core from a larger differentiated parent body.\"\n\nThis is a coherent sentence about the asteroid Psyche, describing it as a metallic core from a larger differentiated parent body.\n\nWait, I just realized that there's one more emoji I haven't accounted for:\n\nRereading the prompt, there's mention of 🐰, but I don't see it in the encoded sentence. Let me double-check the entire prompt:\n\n```\nEncoded Sentence: psyche 🐨ppe🐨🐶s 🤔o be 🐨 genuine c🐨se o👻 🐨n expose🥺 me🤔🐨🐮🐮ic co🐶e 👻🐶om 🐨 🐮🐨🐶ge🐶 🥺i👻👻e🐶en🤔i🐨🤔e🥺 p🐨🐶en🤔 bo🥺y.\n```\n\nI don't see the 🐰 emoji here either. I must have been mistaken. The emojis in the prompt are:\n🐨 (a), 🐶, 🐰, 🤔, 👻, 🥺, 🐮, 🐰, 🐶, 🤔, 🐨, 🐮, 🐮, 🐶, 👻, 🐶, 🐨, 🐮, 🐨, 🐶, 🐶, 🥺, 👻, 👻, 🐶, 🤔, 🐨, 🤔, 🥺, 🐨, 🐶, 🤔, 🥺\n\nActually, I see another emoji I hadn't noted before: 🐰. But this doesn't actually seem to be in the sentence either. Let me read through the encoded sentence character by character again to be sure:\n\n```\np s y c h e   🐨 p p e 🐨 🐶 s   🤔 o   b e   🐨   g e n u i n e   c 🐨 s e   o 👻   🐨 n   e x p o s e 🥺   m e 🤔 🐨 🐮 🐮 i c   c o 🐶 e   👻 🐶 o m   🐨   🐮 🐨 🐶 g e 🐶   🥺 i 👻 👻 e 🐶 e n 🤔 i 🐨 🤔 e 🥺   p 🐨 🐶 e n 🤔   b o 🥺 y .\n```\n\nI don't see the 🐰 emoji in this sequence. Let me check again if there are any emojis I've missed.\n\nLet me re-read the encoded sentence:\npsyche 🐨ppe🐨🐶s 🤔o be 🐨 genuine c🐨se o👻 🐨n expose🥺 me🤔🐨🐮🐮ic co🐶e 👻🐶om 🐨 🐮🐨🐶ge🐶 🥺i👻👻e🐶en🤔i🐨🤔e🥺 p🐨🐶en🤔 bo🥺y.\n\nI see the following emojis:\n🐨 (a)\n🐶 (r)\n🤔 (t)\n👻 (f)\n🥺 (d)\n🐮 (l)\n\nLet me re-check once more for any emojis I might have missed:\n\nSearching for 🐰 in \"psyche\" - not found.\nSearching for 🐰 in \"🐨ppe🐨🐶s\" - not found.\nSearching for 🐰 in \"🤔o\" - not found.\nSearching for 🐰 in \"be\" - not found.\nSearching for 🐰 in \"🐨\" - not found.\nSearching for 🐰 in \"genuine\" - not found.\nSearching for 🐰 in \"c🐨se\" - not found.\nSearching for 🐰 in \"o👻\" - not found.\nSearching for 🐰 in \"🐨n\" - not found.\nSearching for 🐰 in \"expose🥺\" - not found.\nSearching for 🐰 in \"me🤔🐨🐮🐮ic\" - not found.\nSearching for 🐰 in \"co🐶e\" - not found.\nSearching for 🐰 in \"👻🐶om\" - not found.\nSearching for 🐰 in \"🐨\" - not found.\nSearching for 🐰 in \"🐮🐨🐶ge🐶\" - not found.\nSearching for 🐰 in \"🥺i👻👻e🐶en🤔i🐨🤔e🥺\" - not found.\nSearching for 🐰 in \"p🐨🐶en🤔\" - not found.\nSearching for 🐰 in \"bo🥺y\" - not found.\n\nI think I was confusing myself because 🐰 and 🐶 look similar, but they are different emojis.\n\nNow I'm actually seeing that I've listed the emoji 🐰 in some of my analyses, but it's a mistake. I don't actually see 🐰 in the encoded sentence. I only see 🐶 (which I've determined is 'r').\n\nActually, there's one other ambiguity in the sentence. There's a word that looks like \"🐶\" which I've been interpreting as \"r\" but should probably be \"🐰\" for a different letter. But as I've gone through the sentence character by character several times now, I don't see any 🐰, only 🐶.\n\nLet me carefully review the sentence one more time to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nI'm looking at:\npsyche 🐨ppe🐨🐶s 🤔o be 🐨 genuine c🐨se o👻 🐨n expose🥺 me🤔🐨🐮🐮ic co🐶e 👻🐶om 🐨 🐮🐨🐶ge🐶 🥺i👻👻e🐶en🤔i🐨🤔e🥺 p🐨🐶en🤔 bo🥺y.\n\nAnd the emojis I see are:\n🐨 (a)\n🐶 (r)\n🤔 (t)\n👻 (f)\n🥺 (d)\n🐮 (l)\n\nI think I was mistaken about 🐰. It doesn't appear in the sentence.\n\nNow, let's finalize my answer:\n\n1. Psyche appears to be a genuine case of an exposed metallic core from a larger differentiated parent body.\n\n2. The emoji-to-letter mapping:\n🐨 = a (given)\n🐶 = r\n🤔 = t\n👻 = f\n🥺 = d\n🐮 = l\n\nLet me double-check this against the original sentence:\npsyche 🐨ppe🐨🐶s 🤔o be 🐨 genuine c🐨se o👻 🐨n expose🥺 me🤔🐨🐮🐮ic co🐶e 👻🐶om 🐨 🐮🐨🐶ge🐶 🥺i👻👻e🐶en🤔i🐨🤔e🥺 p🐨🐶en🤔 bo🥺y.\n\nWith the substitution:\npsyche appears to be a genuine case of an exposed metallic core from a larger differentiated parent body.\n\nThis looks correct to me. So my final answer is:\n🐨 = a (given)\n🐶 = r\n🤔 = t\n👻 = f\n🥺 = d\n🐮 = l\n\nWait, let me double-check one more thing. In the prompt, it says \"Then, I will reveal the letter corresponding to the most frequently occurring emoji.\" It seems like 🐨 = a was given as a hint because it's the most frequent emoji in the sentence. Let me count:\n\n🐨: 10 occurrences\n🐶: 9 occurrences\n🤔: 5 occurrences\n👻: 4 occurrences\n🥺: 4 occurrences\n🐮: 4 occurrences\n\nSo indeed, 🐨 is the most frequent, followed by 🐶.\n\nNow, let me check one more thing. The emoji 🐶 corresponds to the letter 'r', which is indeed a common letter in English. Let's check the other frequencies:\n\n🐨 = a: Makes sense, 'a' is one of the most common letters in English.\n🐶 = r: Makes sense, 'r' is also a common letter.\n🤔 = t: Makes sense, 't' is a very common letter.\n👻 = f: This is less common, but still plausible.\n🥺 = d: Makes sense, 'd' is moderately common.\n🐮 = l: Makes sense, 'l' is moderately common.\n\nThese all look plausible in terms of frequency.\n\nNow, I've double-checked my work and I'm confident in my answer.\n\nI need to format my answer as requested in the instructions. The instructions say to submit guesses in the format 'emoji=letter'.\n\nSo, my answer is:\n🐨=a, 🐶=r, 🤔=t, 👻=f, 🥺=d, 🐮=l\n\nActually, let me be super careful to make sure I'm interpreting the emoji correctly, as sometimes emojis can look similar:\n\n🐨: This is a koala face. I'm saying this corresponds to 'a'.\n🐶: This is a dog face. I'm saying this corresponds to 'r'.\n🤔: This is a thinking face. I'm saying this corresponds to 't'.\n👻: This is a ghost. I'm saying this corresponds to 'f'.\n🥺: This is a pleading face. I'm saying this corresponds to 'd'.\n🐮: This is a cow face. I'm saying this corresponds to 'l'.\n\nActually, I think I should double-check 🐶 = r since this is the one I was confused about earlier. Let's see where 🐶 appears:\n\nIn the word \"appe🐶s\", 🐶 = r.\nIn the word \"co🐶e\", 🐶 = r.\nIn the word \"f🐶om\", 🐶 = r.\nIn the word \"la🐶ge🐶\", 🐶 = r.\nIn the word \"diffe🐶entiated\", 🐶 = r.\nIn the word \"pa🐶ent\", 🐶 = r.\n\nAll of these check out with 🐶 = r.\n\nLet me check a couple of the other substitutions, just to be extra sure:\n\n🥺 in \"expose🥺\" = d, which gives \"exposed\".\n🥺 in \"🥺ifferentiate🥺\" = d, which gives \"differentiated\".\n🥺 in \"bo🥺y\" = d, which gives \"body\".\n\nThat checks out.\n\nAlso:\n🤔 in \"🤔o\" = t, which gives \"to\".\n🤔 in \"me🤔allic\" = t, which gives \"metallic\".\n🤔 in \"differen🤔ia🤔ed\" = t, which gives \"differentiated\".\n🤔 in \"paren🤔\" = t, which gives \"parent\".\n\nThat checks out too.\n\nI'm confident in my answer. Let me format it as requested: 'emoji=letter', separated by commas.\n\nSo, my answer is:\n🐨=a, 🐶=r, 🤔=t, 👻=f, 🥺=d, 🐮=l# Crypto Word Game Analysis\n\nLooking at the encoded sentence, I need to determine what each emoji represents. The hint tells me that 🐨=a.\n\nLet me begin by substituting this hint into the encoded sentence:\n```\npsyche appeaᵣs to be a genuine case of an exposed metallic coᵣe fᵣom a laᵣgeᵣ diffeᵣentiated paᵣent body.\n```\n\nBy analyzing word patterns and common English structures, I can deduce the remaining emojis:\n\n- The word \"appe🐨🐶s\" is likely \"appears\", so 🐶=r\n- \"🤔o\" is likely \"to\", so 🤔=t\n- \"o👻\" is likely \"of\", so 👻=f\n- \"expose🥺\" is likely \"exposed\", so 🥺=d\n- \"me🤔🐨🐮🐮ic\" is likely \"metallic\", so 🐮=l\n\nWith these substitutions, the sentence reads coherently:\n\"psyche appears to be a genuine case of an exposed metallic core from a larger differentiated parent body.\"\n\nThis makes perfect sense as it's describing the asteroid Psyche, which is believed to be an exposed metallic core of a protoplanet.\n\n## Final Decoding:\n- 🐨 represents 'a' (given as hint)\n- 🐶 represents 'r'\n- 🤔 represents 't'\n- 👻 represents 'f'\n- 🥺 represents 'd'\n- 🐮 represents 'l'\n\nAnswer: 🐨=a,🐶=r,🤔=t,👻=f,🥺=d,🐮=l"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Let me re-check the encodings.\n\n\"the germa😇 bat𝑡leshi🐹 bismar🐭🤓 is o😇e of the most famo🤥s warshi🐹s of the se🐭o😇d world war.\"\n\nSo we have:\n- 🤭 = t (given)\n- 😇 = n (from \"germa😇\" and \"o😇e\" and \"se🐭o😇d\")\n- 🐹 = p (from \"battleshi🐹\" and \"warshi🐹s\")\n- 🐭 = c (from \"bismar🐭🤓\")\n- 🤓 = k (from \"bismar🐭🤓\")\n- 🤥 = u (from \"famo🤥s\")\n- 🐭 = c (from \"se🐭o😇d\")\n\nBut there seems to be an issue with the last assignment. Let's re-analyze:\n\n\"the germa😇 bat𝑡leshi🐹 bismar🐭🤓 is o😇e of the most famo🤥s warshi🐹s of the se🐭o😇d world war.\"\n\nIn \"se🐭o😇d\", the emoji 🐭 should encode \"c\" if it's \"second\". But I've also assigned 🐭 to \"c\" in \"bismar🐭🤓\". This is consistent, so there's no problem here.\n\nLet's summarize our encryption guesses again:\n- 🤭 = t (given)\n- 😇 = n (from \"germa😇\", \"o😇e\", \"se🐭o😇d\")\n- 🐹 = p (from \"battleshi🐹\", \"warshi🐹s\")\n- 🐭 = c (from \"bismar🐭🤓\", \"se🐭o😇d\")\n- 🤓 = k (from \"bismar🐭🤓\")\n- 🤥 = u (from \"famo🤥s\")\n\nOK, we're asked to submit as emoji=letter, so let's organize that:\n🤭=t\n😇=n\n🐹=p\n🐭=c\n🤓=k\n🤥=u\n\nSo our answer should be:\n🤭=t,😇=n,🐹=p,🐭=c,🤓=k,🤥=u\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement to double-check my format and ensure I've understood the task correctly.\n\nBased on the problem statement, it seems I'm supposed to guess the letter corresponding to each emoji. The emojis are used to replace letters in a sentence, and I need to figure out which letter each emoji represents.\n\nLet me double check:\n\n\"🤭he germa😇 ba🤭🤭leshi🐹 bismar🐭🤓 is o😇e of 🤭he mos🤭 famo🤥s warshi🐹s of 🤭he se🐭o😇d world war.\"\n\nWith our guesses:\n- 🤭 = t (given)\n- 😇 = n\n- 🐹 = p\n- 🐭 = c\n- 🤓 = k\n- 🤥 = u\n\nThis would read:\n\"the german battleship bismarck is one of the most famous warships of the second world war.\"\n\nThis seems correct! I've correctly identified the mapping for emojis in the sentence.\n\nActually, I realized that I might have misinterpreted the format. The instruction says:\n\n\"please submit your guesses for this round in the format 'emoji=word', separated by commas, e.g., 'Answer: 😀=c,😂=d...'\"\n\nThe example says \"emoji=word\" but shows \"😀=c\", which is actually \"emoji=letter\". So it seems like we're just guessing letters, not entire words.\n\nGiven that clarification, our answer should be:\n🤭=t,😇=n,🐹=p,🐭=c,🤓=k,🤥=u\n\nWait, I'm re-reading the problem and the hint more carefully:\n\n\"Hint: 🤭=t\"\n\nSo the hint already tells us that 🤭 represents the letter 't'. \n\nBased on the problem statement, all we need to do is to submit our guesses for this round in the format 'emoji=letter' (one for each emoji). However, the answer format seems to match what I've already done, so I'll stick with my previous reasoning.\n\nActually, let me re-check the encoded sentence:\n\n\"🤭he germa😇 ba🤭🤭leshi🐹 bismar🐭🤓 is o😇e of 🤭he mos🤭 famo🤥s warshi🐹s of 🤭he se🐭o😇d world war.\"\n\nWith the hint that 🤭=t, I get:\n\n\"the germa😇 ba𝑡𝑡leshi🐹 bismar🐭🤓 is o😇e of the mos𝑡 famo🤥s warshi🐹s of the se🐭o😇d world war.\"\n\nFrom the context, I can infer:\n- 😇 probably represents 'n', as in \"german\" and \"one\".\n- 🐹 probably represents 'p', as in \"battleship\" and \"warships\".\n- 🐭 probably represents 'c', as in \"bismarck\" and \"second\".\n- 🤓 probably represents 'k', as in \"bismarck\".\n- 🤥 probably represents 'u', as in \"famous\".\n\nSo, in the format 'emoji=letter':\n🤭=t (given as hint)\n😇=n\n🐹=p\n🐭=c\n🤓=k\n🤥=u\n\nAnd if I combine them:\n🤭=t,😇=n,🐹=p,🐭=c,🤓=k,🤥=u\n\nWait, let me double-check \"se🐭o😇d\". If 🐭=c and 😇=n, then we'd have \"secnod\". That doesn't seem right. Let's reconsider the mapping.\n\nHmm, I think I went too fast. Let's decompose the words one by one:\n\n\"🤭he\" -> \"the\" (with the given hint 🤭=t)\n\"germa😇\" -> likely \"german\", so 😇=n.\n\"ba🤭🤭leshi🐹\" -> with 🤭=t, this becomes \"battleshi🐹\". If it's \"battleship\", then 🐹=p.\n\"bismar🐭🤓\" -> likely \"bismarck\", so 🐭=c and 🤓=k.\n\"is\" -> No emojis.\n\"o😇e\" -> With 😇=n, this becomes \"one\", confirming 😇=n.\n\"of\" -> No emojis.\n\"🤭he\" -> \"the\" (with the given hint 🤭=t).\n\"mos🤭\" -> with 🤭=t, this becomes \"most\".\n\"famo🤥s\" -> likely \"famous\", so 🤥=u.\n\"warshi🐹s\" -> with 🐹=p, this becomes \"warships\", confirming 🐹=p.\n\"of\" -> No emojis.\n\"🤭he\" -> \"the\" (with the given hint 🤭=t).\n\"se🐭o😇d\" -> If 🐭=c and 😇=n, this would be \"second\".\n\"world\" -> No emojis.\n\"war\" -> No emojis.\n\nSo our mapping is:\n🤭=t (given as hint)\n😇=n\n🐹=p\n🐭=c\n🤓=k\n🤥=u\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the word \"se🐭o😇d\". I would expect \"second\" in this context.\nWith 🐭=c and 😇=n, I get \"secnd\" which is missing an \"o\". There should be another emoji in that case. \n\nHmm, let's back up. Let me re-check the original encoded sentence:\n\n\"🤭he germa😇 ba🤭🤭leshi🐹 bismar🐭🤓 is o😇e of 🤭he mos🤭 famo🤥s warshi🐹s of 🤭he se🐭o😇d world war.\"\n\nI see, I missed the \"o\" between 🐭 and 😇 in \"se🐭o😇d\".\nWith 🐭=c, o=o, and 😇=n, it becomes \"second\".\n\nAlright, so my mapping is:\n🤭=t (given as hint)\n😇=n\n🐹=p\n🐭=c\n🤓=k\n🤥=u\n\nIn the required format, the answer is:\n🤭=t,😇=n,🐹=p,🐭=c,🤓=k,🤥=u\n\nOkay, let me review the entire problem statement one more time, because I want to ensure I've understood the assignment correctly.\n\nHmm, I notice another sentence that says \"Note that the emoji provided as a hint, as well as previously correctly answered emojis, must also be included in your answer\".\n\nThis means that I need to include the emoji 🤭 and its corresponding letter 't' in my answer. I've already done that, so I believe my answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is:\n🤭=t,😇=n,🐹=p,🐭=c,🤓=k,🤥=u\n\nLet me double-check the requested format again. The problem says: \"submit your guesses for this round in the format 'emoji=word', separated by commas, e.g., 'Answer: 😀=c,😂=d...'\"\n\nBut the example \"😀=c\" seems to indicate that it should be 'emoji=letter', not 'emoji=word'. Since I've been using 'emoji=letter' format and it aligns with the example, I'll stick with that.\n\nSo, my final answer is:\nAnswer: 🤭=t,😇=n,🐹=p,🐭=c,🤓=k,🤥=u# Analysis of the Crypto Word Game\n\nLooking at the encoded sentence: \n```\n🤭he germa😇 ba🤭🤭leshi🐹 bismar🐭🤓 is o😇e of 🤭he mos🤭 famo🤥s warshi🐹s of 🤭he se🐭o😇d world war.\n```\n\nWith the hint 🤭=t, I can begin decoding:\n\n1. First, I'll replace all instances of 🤭 with 't':\n```\nthe germa😇 battleshi🐹 bismar🐭🤓 is o😇e of the most famo🤥s warshi🐹s of the se🐭o😇d world war.\n```\n\n2. Now I can identify some patterns:\n   - \"germa😇\" is likely \"german\", so 😇=n\n   - \"battleshi🐹\" is likely \"battleship\", so 🐹=p\n   - \"bismar🐭🤓\" is likely \"bismarck\", so 🐭=c and 🤓=k\n   - \"o😇e\" becomes \"one\" (confirming 😇=n)\n   - \"famo🤥s\" is likely \"famous\", so 🤥=u\n   - \"se🐭o😇d\" becomes \"second\" (confirming 🐭=c and 😇=n)\n\n3. After decoding, the sentence reads:\n```\nthe german battleship bismarck is one of the most famous warships of the second world war.\n```\n\nThis makes perfect sense historically, as the Bismarck was indeed a famous German battleship from World War II.\n\nAnswer: 🤭=t,😇=n,🐹=p,🐭=c,🤓=k,🤥=u"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

It might be \"tall\" or \"task\".\n2. \"sno🐶\" appears twice.\n3. \"🐸e😈eate🐸\" looks like it could be \"defeated\" or a similar word.\n4. \"sub🐦it\" has 🐦 which might be 'm' making the word \"submit\".\n\nLet's think about the frequent emojis and what they might represent:\n\n🐼 appears multiple times.\n🐸 appears at the beginning of what seems to be a verb.\n🐶 appears in multiple contexts.\n😈 appears in what might be \"defeated\" and \"forced\".\n\nGiven the context, this seems to be describing a game or competition where one team defeated another and forced them to submit. The numbers \"(5: 20)\" might represent a score or time.\n\nLet's make some guesses:\n\n🐼 = l (making it \"tall\")\n🐸 = d (making it \"defeated\")\n🐶 = w (making \"snow\" and \"with\")\n😈 = f (making \"defeated\" and \"forced\")\n🐦 = m (making \"submit\")\n🐷 = t (making \"at\")\n\nBut wait, we already know 😍 = t, so 🐷 can't be t. Hmm, let's reconsider.\n\nActually, \"ta🐼🐼\" could be \"team\", which would mean 🐼 = e, and then \"tea🐦\" would still be \"team\" with 🐦 = m.\n\nIf \"sno🐶\" is \"snow\", then 🐶 = w.\n\nBut then \"🐸e😈eate🐸\" would be \"de😈eated\", which doesn't fit with 😈 = f. Let's reconsider.\n\nGiven that the context seems to be about a game or competition, let's try:\n\n🐼 = a (making it \"taa\" which doesn't make sense, but maybe it's part of a bigger word)\n🐸 = d (making it \"defeated\")\n🐶 = w (making \"snow\" and \"with\")\n😈 = f (making \"defeated\" and \"forced\")\n🐦 = m (making \"submit\")\n🐷 = s (making \"as\")\n\nLet's adjust:\n\nIf 🐸 = d, then \"🐸e😈eate🐸\" would be \"de😈eated\". For this to be \"defeated\", 😈 would need to be f. \n\nLet's keep tracing through:\n\n\"ta🐼🐼 🐸e😈eate🐸 a🐷 sno🐶\" becomes \"ta🐼🐼 defeated a🐷 snow\"\n\nHmm, that doesn't make complete sense yet.\n\nLet's try once more with a different guess for 🐼:\n\nIf 🐼 = l, then \"ta🐼🐼\" becomes \"tall\", and \"ta🐼🐼🐦ission\" becomes \"tall🐦ission\", which doesn't make sense.\n\nWhat about 🐷? If 🐼 = l, then \"a🐷\" could be \"at\".\n\nLet's try to make a comprehensive guess:\n🐼 = l (making \"tall\")\n🐸 = d (making \"defeated\")\n🐶 = w (making \"snow\" and \"with\")\n😈 = f (making \"defeated\" and \"forced\")\n🐦 = m (making \"submit\" and \"tallmission\")\n🐷 = t (but wait, 😍 = t, so this is inconsistent)\n\nHmm, let's reconsider.\n\nWhat if the encoded sentence is about a basketball game? \"Tall\" could refer to height, and \"snow\" might be a team or player name.\n\nLet's try again:\n🐼 = l (making \"tall\")\n🐸 = d (making \"defeated\")\n🐶 = w (making \"snow\" and \"with\")\n😈 = f (making \"defeated\" and \"forced\")\n🐦 = m (making \"submit\")\n🐷 = n (making \"an\")\n\nThis makes more sense: \"tall defeated an snow (5: 20) tall forced snow to submit with the tallmission.\"\n\nBut, \"tallmission\" is still odd. Let's reconsider 🐼:\n\nIf 🐼 = l, then \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"tall\". But i 🐼 = s, then \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"tass\", which doesn't make sense.\n\nOk, let's think about the structure of the sentence:\n\"ta🐼🐼 🐸e😈eate🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20)\" feels like the start of a game report. It's stating who defeated whom and by what score.\n\nIn the context of a game, \"ta🐼🐼\" could be \"team\", which would mean 🐼 = a or e (making it \"taam\" or \"teem\", neither of which make sense).\n\nWait, what if it's referring to a specific team? Like \"tall\"? That could make sense if we're describing a basketball team. And if 🐼 = l and 🐸 = d, then \"🐸e😈eate🐸\" becomes \"de😈eated\". For this to be \"defeated\", 😈 would need to be f.\n\nSo, our guesses:\n😍 = t (given)\n🐼 = l (making \"tall\")\n🐸 = d (making \"defeated\")\n😈 = f (making \"defeated\" and \"forced\")\n🐶 = w (making \"snow\" and \"with\")\n🐦 = m (making \"submit\")\n🐷 = n (making \"an\")\n\nWith these substitutions, the sentence would read: \"tall defeated an snow (5: 20) tall forced snow to submit with the tallmission.\"\n\nThis still doesn't feel completely right due to \"an snow\" and \"tallmission\". Let's keep refining.\n\nWhat if 🐷 = n?\nThen \"a🐷\" would be \"an\", which makes sense before \"snow\" (\"an snow\").\n\nParsing through more, \"ta🐼🐼\" appears multiple times. It's at the beginning of the sentence and after the score. \n\nIf 🐼 = l, then \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"tall\" and \"ta🐼🐼🐦ission\" would be \"tallmission\". This last word seems odd, but maybe it's a coined term in the context of the game.\n\nLet's finalize our guesses and check the overall sentence:\n😍 = t (given)\n🐼 = l (making \"tall\" and \"tallmission\")\n🐸 = d (making \"defeated\")\n😈 = f (making \"defeated\" and \"forced\")\n🐶 = w (making \"snow\" and \"with\")\n🐦 = m (making \"submit\")\n🐷 = n (making \"an\")\n\nWith these substitutions, the sentence would be: \"tall defeated an snow (5: 20) tall forced snow to submit with the tallmission.\"\n\nNow, the sentence seems to be about a tall person or team defeating \"snow\" with a score of 5 to\n0, and then forcing \"snow\" to submit with something called \"tallmission\".\n\nActually, can \"an snow\" make sense? Let's reconsider 🐷:\n\nIf 🐼 = l, 🐸 = d, and 😈 = f, then \"🐸e😈eate🐸\" becomes \"defeated\". \n\nLet's try 🐷 = t, but that's already taken by 😍. What about 🐷 = \"a\"? Then \"a🐷\" would be \"aa\", which doesn't make sense.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's take a step back.\n\nThe context seems to be about a basketball game or similar. \"Snow\" in this context might be a team name, like \"St. Snow\" or similar, in which case 🐶 = w.\n\nLet's go sentence by sentence:\n\n\"tall 🐸e😈eate🐸 a🐷 snow (5: 20)\"\n\nIf 🐸 = d and 😈 = f, then 🐸e😈eate🐸 becomes \"defeated\", which fits the context. But what does \"a🐷 snow\" mean?\n\nLet's now consider the rest of the sentence:\n\n\"tall 😈orce🐸 snow to sub🐦it with the tall🐦ission.\"\n\nIf 😈 = f, then 😈orce🐸 becomes \"forced\", which fits the context. \n\nSub🐦it looks like \"submit\", which would mean 🐦 = m.\n\nWith these observations, let's refine our guesses:\n😍 = t (given)\n🐼 = l (making \"tall\")\n🐸 = d (making \"defeated\")\n😈 = f (making \"defeated\" and \"forced\")\n🐶 = w (making \"snow\" and \"with\")\n🐦 = m (making \"submit\")\n🐷 = (to be determined)\n\nWait, let's take a closer look at this part:\n\"tall defeated a🐷 snow (5: 20)\"\n\nIf \"snow\" is a team, maybe \"a🐷\" is a preposition or article. It could be \"at\" or \"as\". We already know 😍 = t, so 🐷 = s (making it \"as\").\n\nWith all of our guesses, the sentence would be:\n\n\"tall defeated as snow (5: 20) tall forced snow to submit with the tallmission.\"\n\nwait a minute, my analysis didn't use the knowledge that we already know 😍 = t. That'll help with determining some of these other letters!\n\nSo with 😍 = t, we already know that the phrase \"😍a🐼🐼\" is \"ta🐼🐼\" and \"😍o\" is \"to\" and \"😍he\" is \"the\", etc.\n\nThinking about the contexts, \"ta🐼🐼\" is likely to be \"tall\" (given that it repeats and the next word might be \"defeated\"), which implies 🐼 = l.\n\nSo, our guesses so far:\n😍 = t (given)\n🐼 = l (making \"tall\")\n\n\"tall 🐸e😈eate🐸 a🐷 sno🐶\" would make sense as \"tall defeated a_ snow\" if 🐸 = d, 😈 = f, and 🐶 = w.\n\nNow for 🐷, what's a word that would fit in the blank of \"tall defeated a_ snow\"? It could be \"at\" or \"as\", which means 🐷 = t or s. Since 😍 = t, 🐷 ≠ t, so 🐷 = s.\n\nContinuing, \"tall forced snow to sub🐦it 🐶ith the tall🐦ission\" makes sense if 🐦 = m and 🐶 = w.\n\nSo, our refined guesses:\n😍 = t (given)\n🐼 = l (making \"tall\")\n🐸 = d (making \"defeated\")\n😈 = f (making \"defeated\" and \"forced\")\n🐶 = w (making \"snow\" and \"with\")\n🐦 = m (making \"submit\")\n🐷 = s (making \"as\")\n\nWith these substitutions, the sentence becomes:\n\"tall defeated as snow (5: 20) tall forced snow to submit with the tallmission.\"\n\nActually, I think this still has grammar issues. Let's revisit.\n\n\"tall defeated as snow\" doesn't sound quite right. Maybe \"as\" is not the correct interpretation. Looking at the context again, \"ta🐼🐼 🐸e😈eate🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20)\" seems to be a game report. The (5: 20) looks like a score.\n\nSo, \"tall defeated a_ snow (5: 20)\" should have a word that makes sense in the context of a game report.\n\nWhat could \"a🐷\" be? It could be \"at\", but we know 🐷 ≠ t because 😍 = t. It could also be \"a\" followed by a consonant, like \"ab\", \"ac\", \"ad\", etc.\n\nWait, what if it's \"a\" followed by a proper noun? Something like \"a [team name] snow\" or \"a [player name] snow\"?\n\nActually, what if it's \"a big snow\"? That would make 🐷 = b. Let's see if that fits the context:\n\n\"tall defeated a big snow (5: 20) tall forced snow to submit with the tallmission.\"\n\nThat doesn't sound right either. What other options are there?\n\nLet's consider: \"tall defeated a [?] snow\".\n\nThe [?] should be a descriptor or a possessive that makes sense in the context of the game. Options include:\n- \"a cold snow\"\n- \"a wet snow\"\n- \"a pure snow\"\n- \"a thin snow\"\n- \"a wild snow\"\n- \"a calm snow\"\n- \"a vast snow\"\n- \"a dark snow\"\n- etc.\n\nGiven the context of a game or competition, words like \"wild\", \"calm\", \"vast\", \"dark\" might fit better.\n\nSo, could 🐷 = w, v, c, r, p, h, j, k, g?\n\nLet's try 🐷 = h (making \"ah\"), but that doesn't form a word with \"a\". \n\nActually, I see a simpler interpretation. What if \"a🐷 snow\" isn't \"a [adjective] snow,\" but just \"at snow\"? That would make 🐷 = t, but we already know 😍 = t. This is confusing.\n\nLet me start from the beginning. With 😍 = t, let's see what the sentence looks like with the explicit replacements:\n\n\"ta🐼🐼 🐸e😈eate🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) ta🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 to sub🐦it 🐶ith the ta🐼🐼🐦ission.\"\n\nGiven that 😍 is the most frequently occurring emoji, I'm even more convinced that it's supposed to be \"tall\"for \"ta🐼🐼\", so 🐼 = l.\n\n\"tall 🐸e😈eate🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) tall 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 to sub🐦it 🐶ith the tall🐦ission.\"\n\nNow, if \"🐸e😈eate🐸\" is \"defeated\" (which seems to make sense), then 🐸 = d and 😈 = f.\n\n\"tall defeated a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) tall forced sno🐶 to sub🐦it 🐶ith the tall🐦ission.\"\n\nThe phrase \"sub🐦it\" probably means \"submit\", so 🐦 = m.\n\n\"tall defeated a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) tall forced sno🐶 to submit 🐶ith the tallmission.\"\n\nAnd if \"sno🐶\" is \"snow\" (which seems to fit the context of what could be defeated, and the game is possibly on snow or ice), then 🐶 = w.\n\n\"tall defeated a🐷 snow (5: 20) tall forced snow to submit with the tallmission.\"\n\nNow, the final piece is 🐷. What is \"a🐷 snow\"?\n\nIn the context of a game report, it could be:\n- \"as snow\" (making 🐷 = s)\n- \"a_ snow\" where '_' is an adjective or descriptor for snow or a team called \"Snow\".\n\nIf \"snow\" is a team name, like \"Snow Lions\" or \"Snowmen\", then \"a🐷\" should be a preposition or article paired with a possessive. Like \"as\" or \"at\" or similar.\n\nGiven the constraints, my best guess is 🐷 = s, making \"a🐷\" into \"as\".\n\nThat would mean to this interpretation: \"tall defeated as snow (5: 20) tall forced snow to submit with the tallmission.\"\n\nActually, I'm still not sure about \"as snow\". It doesn't sound right in English. Let's reconsider.\n\nWait, I missed another possibility. What if \"sno🐶\" is actually the name of the second team? Like \"tall vs. snow\" or \"tall against snow\"? That would make \"a🐷\" into \"a preposition\".\n\nCommon prepositions are:\n- in\n- on\n- at\n- by\n- for\n- from\n- of\n- vs.\n- via\n\nGiven the context, \"vs.\" or \"against\" or similar would fit.\n\nIf 🐷 = v, then \"a🐷\" becomes \"av\", which isn't a preposition.\nIf 🐷 = g, then \"a🐷\" becomes \"ag\", which is part of \"against\", but not a full preposition.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let me try to approach it differently.\n\nGiven the context and structure, \"tall\" and \"snow\" seem to be teams or entities engaged in a competition. \"(5: 20)\" appears to be a score. So, \"tall defeated a🐷 snow (5: 20)\" is mentioning one team's victory over another.\n\nThe preposition or phrase \"a🐷\" should fit naturally in this context. It could be \"at\", but 🐷 ≠ t because 😍 = t.\n\nWait, let's check again: \"tall defeated a🐷 snow (5: 20)\".\n\nWhen reporting sports or competition results, we often say something like:\n- \"Team A defeated Team B [score]\"\n- \"Team A wins over\/against Team B [score]\"\n- \"Team A beats Team B [score]\"\n\nGiven this, \"a🐷\" might simply be \"a\". If that's the case, 🐷 should be a space or a different character. But emojis typically replace letters, not spaces, so this doesn't seem right.\n\nCould it be a typo or a grammatical inconsistency in the encoded sentence?\n\nLet's try another approach. Let's read the entire sentence with our guesses:\n\n\"tall defeated a🐷 snow (5: 20) tall forced snow to submit with the tallmission.\"\n\nIf \"a🐷 snow\" is a proper noun, a team or player name, then it would make sense in context. Maybe it's \"A.J. Snow\" or \"A.P. Snow\" or similar? That would make 🐷 a letter like J, P, etc.\n\nActually, \"a-\" could be a prefix, meaning \"not\" or \"opposite of\", like \"asymmetric\". But \"a\" followed by a consonant doesn't form many common English prefixes.\n\nWait, I had one other possibility. What if it's \"a snow\", and 🐷 is just there to confuse us or is a delimiter? That would make the sentence: \"tall defeated a snow (5: 20) tall forced snow to submit with the tallmission.\" This seems grammatically sound but lacks a certain precision you'd expect in a game report.\n\nAlright, this is challenging. Let me try one more approach with the letter frequencies.\n\nFrom the known information, 🐷 appears only once in the entire sentence. This means it's a less common letter. Given the context of sport or competition, the preposition or article \"a🐷\" before \"snow\" should be something commonly used in such reports.\n\nAfter further reflection, even though I think 🐷 = s (\"as snow\") still sounds awkward, it seems to be the best fit for the constraints and context. Moreover, \"tall forced snow to submit with the tallmission\" (assuming 🐦 = m) makes sense in the context of a competition between \"tall\" and \"snow\".\n\nI'm therefore sticking with 🐷 = s and the overall interpretation:\n\n\"tall defeated as snow (5: 20) tall forced snow to submit with the tallmission.\"\n\nActually the more I read this the more it feels like there's still a piece of the puzzle missing. Let's take another look.\n\n\"tall defeated a🐷 snow (5: 20) tall forced snow to submit with the tallmission.\"\n\nIn a typical sports report, you'd hear something like \"Team A defeated Team B by [score]\" or \"Team A defeated Team B at [location]\".\n\nGiven this, \"a🐷\" might be \"at\" (indicating location) or \"by\" (indicating manner). We know 🐷 ≠ t since 😍 = t. But 🐷 could be b, making \"a🐷\" into \"ab\". But \"ab\" isn't a preposition or article.\n\nMaybe it's a typo in the encoding, and \"a🐷\" is supposed to be \"and\"? If 🐷 = n, then \"a🐷\" becomes \"an\", which is an article.\n\n\"tall defeated an snow (5: 20)\" doesn't sound right, but \"snow\" might be a proper noun starting with a vowel sound, like \"Ansnow\" or \"Ensnow\" or something. But then the next part, \"tall forced snow to submit with the tallmission,\" indicates \"snow\" is a standalone term.\n\nThis is truly perplexing. I'm starting to think there might be an error or ambiguity in the encoded sentence. \"a🐷 snow\" seems to be a crucial junction.\n\nActually, let's revisit the meaning and structure of the entire sentence:\n\n\"tall 🐸e😈eate🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) tall 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 to sub🐦it 🐶ith the tall🐦ission.\"\n\nWith the guesses I've made to this point (except 🐷 = ?):\n\n\"tall defeated a? snow (5: 20) tall forced snow to submit with the tallmission.\"\n\nIn such a context, \"snow\" might not be a team name but a condition or environment. Given the parenthesized score of \"(5: 20)\", it sounds like a competition, but could it be a challenge of some sort in snowy conditions?\n\nFor instance, \"tall defeated a_ snow challenge\" or \"tall navigated a_ snow terrain\". In such a case, \"_\" would be a descriptor for snow, like \"deep\", \"heavy\", \"hard\", etc.\n\nIf 🐷 = r (making \"ar\" which could be part of \"hard\"), it would read \"tall defeated ar snow,\" which still doesn't make sense directly but could be part of a larger descriptor.\n\nIf 🐷 = h (making \"ah\" which doesn't form a common English word), it would read \"tall defeated ah snow,\" which is awkward.\n\nThough I've analyzed several options, I still think 🐷 = s (making \"as\" which makes grammatical sense in the given context) is the best fit. More accurate in the sport context would be \"vs.\" (versus), the \"s\" in \"as\" would at least make it sound like \"is\". So in this interpretation, \"tall defeated as snow\" would be something like \"tall defeated [someone who] is snow\" or \"tall emerged victorious as Snow.\"\n\nWith that, I'll stick with 🐷 = s. But the more I think about it, the more I wonder if there's just some part of the coding game we're missing, or if the sentence might have a typo.\n\nSo, finally, with all of the best guesses above, the sentence interpreted would be:\n\n\"tall defeated as snow (5: 20) tall forced snow to submit with the tallmission.\"\n\nLet's finalize:\n\n😍 = t (given)\n🐼 = l (making \"tall\")\n🐸 = d (making \"defeated\")\n😈 = f (making \"defeated\" and \"forced\")\n🐶 = w (making \"snow\" and \"with\")\n🐦 = m (making \"submit\")\n🐷 = s (making \"as\")\n\nFinal guess: tall defeated as snow (5: 20) tall forced snow to submit with the tallmission.\n\nSo, my final answer for this round is:\n😍 = t (given)\n🐼 = l (making \"tall\")\n🐸 = d (making \"defeated\")\n😈 = f (making \"defeated\" and \"forced\")\n🐶 = w (making \"snow\" and \"with\")\n🐦 = m (making \"submit\")\n🐷 = s (making \"as\")# Crypto Word Game Analysis\n\nLooking at the encoded sentence: \n😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission.\n\nWith the hint that 😍=t, I'll replace this throughout:\nta🐼🐼 🐸e😈eate🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) ta🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 to sub🐦it 🐶ith the ta🐼🐼🐦ission.\n\nI'm going to analyze the structure and common patterns:\n\n1. \"ta🐼🐼\" appears several times, and given the context, this is likely \"tall\" (🐼=l)\n2. \"🐸e😈eate🐸\" seems to be \"defeated\" (🐸=d, 😈=f)\n3. \"sno🐶\" appears multiple times and is likely \"snow\" (🐶=w)\n4. \"sub🐦it\" looks like \"submit\" (🐦=m)\n5. For \"a🐷\", given the context, 🐷 is likely \"s\" making \"as\"\n\nWith these substitutions, the sentence reads:\n\"tall defeated as snow (5: 20) tall forced snow to submit with the tallmission.\"\n\nThis appears to be describing a sports match or competition, where a team or person named \"tall\" defeated someone known as \"snow\" with a score of 5:20, and then forced them to submit.\n\nLet me double-check all my letter assignments:\n- 😍=t (given in the hint)\n- 🐼=l (making \"tall\")\n- 🐸=d (making \"defeated\")\n- 😈=f (making \"forced\")\n- 🐶=w (making \"snow\" and \"with\")\n- 🐦=m (making \"submit\")\n- 🐷=s (making \"as\")\n\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐼=l,🐸=d,😈=f,🐶=w,🐦=m,🐷=s","Let's analyze what we know so far.\n\nThe encoded sentence is:\n😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission.\n\nAnd we have the hint: 😍=t\n\nFrom the previous guess, we know:\n- 😍=t (True)\n- 🐼=l (False)\n- 🐸=d (True)\n- 😈=f (True)\n- 🐶=w (True)\n- 🐦=m (True)\n- 🐷=s (False)\n\nSo the partially decoded sentence with correct guesses marked is:\nta🐼🐼 defa😍ed a🐷 snow (5: 20) ta🐼🐼 forced snow to submit with the ta🐼🐼mission.\n\nLet's try to figure out what 🐼 could be. Since \"🐼=l\" was incorrect, let's think about what else it could be. The word \"ta🐼🐼\" appears multiple times, and it seems to be a substantive (noun). It also appears in \"ta🐼🐼mission\" which could be \"tallmission\", \"tallmission\", etc.\n\nLet's think about what words could fit in the pattern \"ta🐼🐼\":\n- tall (but 🐼 is not \"l\")\n- tann (possible, but doesn't form a common word)\n- tapp (possible, for \"tapp\")\n- tabb (possible, for \"tabb\")\n- tamm (unlikely as a word)\n- tarr (not a common word)\n- tagg (not a common word)\n\nAnd for \"ta🐼🐼mission\", we could have:\n- tannmission (not a word)\n- tappmission (not a word)\n- tabbmission (not a word)\n- tammission (not a word)\n- tarrmission (not a word)\n- taggmission (not a word)\n\nNone of these seems to fit well. Let me try to approach it differently.\n\nActually, let's consider the phrase \"defa😍ed a🐷 snow\". This could be \"defeated a🐷 snow\", where \"a🐷\" is a preposition like \"at\", \"as\", etc.\n\nIf 🐷 is \"t\", then we get \"defeated at snow\", which makes sense, but 🐷 is not \"s\" (as given in the feedback).\n\nLet's try to understand the sentence further: \"ta🐼🐼 defeated a🐷 snow (5: 20) ta🐼🐼 forced snow to submit with the ta🐼🐼mission.\n\nIt looks like a sports or game outcome. The part \"(5: 20)\" seems like a score. \"ta🐼🐼\" seems to be a team name. \n\nMaybe 🐼 is \"e\"? Then we'd have \"taeae\".\nMaybe 🐼 is \"r\"? Then we'd have \"tarr\".\nMaybe 🐼 is \"p\"? Then we'd have \"tapp\".\nMaybe 🐼 is \"b\"? Then we'd have \"tabb\".\n\nWait, what about \"ball\"? That could make sense. If 🐼 is \"a\", then we'd have \"taa\", and \"taaamission\" doesn't make sense.\n\nBut actually, if 🐼 is \"a\", then we'd have \"tall\" (which is the word we initially guessed with 🐼=l, but we were told 🐼 is not \"l\").\n\nLet's see... if 🐼 is \"a\", then we'd have:\n\"taa defeated a🐷 snow (5: 20) taa forced snow to submit with the taamission.\"\n\nThat doesn't seem right. \n\nLet's look at the phrase \"with the ta🐼🐼mission\". If 🐼 is a repeated letter, this phrase might be more understandable. If 🐼 is \"a\", we get \"with the taamission\", which doesn't sound like a common phrase.\n\nHmm, let's look at another angle. Instead of a sports team, maybe \"ta🐼🐼\" is a person or character. And \"ta🐼🐼mission\" could be a mission named after that person.\n\nI'm thinking 🐼 might be \"l\". But feedback said 🐼 is not \"l\". This is puzzling.\n\nLet's try 🐼 = \"r\". Then we'd have \"tarr defeated a🐷 snow (5: 20) tarr forced snow to submit with the tarrmission.\"\n\nNo, that doesn't sound right either.\n\nLet's try 🐼 = \"p\". Then we'd have \"tapp defeated a🐷 snow (5: 20) tapp forced snow to submit with the tappmission.\"\n\nNo, that doesn't sound right either.\n\nMaybe 🐷 is a different letter altogether. Let's reconsider \"defeated a🐷 snow\".\n\nIf 🐷 is \"t\", we get \"defeated at snow\", which makes sense, but I already considered this and 🐷 is not \"s\" (as given in the feedback).\n\nIf 🐷 is \"n\", we get \"defeated an snow\", which doesn't sound grammatically correct.\n\nIf 🐷 is \"p\", we get \"defeated ap snow\", which doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me go back to thinking about \"ta🐼🐼\". If it's a character or entity, what kind of names start with \"ta\" and have two repeated letters?\n\n- Tapp\n- Tarr\n- Tabb\n- Tall (but 🐼 is not \"l\")\n- Tamm\n- Tagg\n- Tabby (if 🐼 is \"b\")\n- Tanny (if 🐼 is \"n\")\n\nActually, I realized I was mistaken earlier. If 🐼 is \"l\", we get \"tall\", not \"taa\". But the feedback said 🐼 is not \"l\". Let me double-check my understanding of the sentence.\n\nOriginal: 😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission.\n\nWith the hints and feedback:\nt a 🐼 🐼   d e f e a t e d   a 🐷   s n o w   (5: 20)   t a 🐼 🐼   f o r c e d   s n o w   t o   s u b m i t   w i t h   t h e   t a 🐼 🐼 m i s s i o n.\n\nI'm stuck with figuring out what 🐼 is. Let's look at the word \"ta🐼🐼mission\". If the word is \"submission\", then 🐼 would be \"s\". But then we'd have \"tass\", which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, I missed something. There's a space. So I'm should be reading \"ta🐼🐼\" and then \"mission\". So it's not \"ta🐼🐼mission\", but \"ta🐼🐼 mission\". This could be something like \"tall mission\" or \"task mission\" or something similar.\n\nActually, the phrase is \"with the ta🐼🐼mission\". There's no space between \"ta🐼🐼\" and \"mission\". So it is a compound word.\n\nLet's go with 🐼 = \"s\". Then we'd have \"tass defeated a🐷 snow (5: 20) tass forced snow to submit with the tassmission.\"\n\n\"Tassmission\" isn't a word, but maybe it's a made-up term for a particular mission related to \"tass\"? \n\nBut then, what would \"tass\" be? It's not a common word. Unless it's an acronym or a proper noun I'm not familiar with.\n\nLet me try once more with a different approach. Let's consider the structure of the sentence: \"X defeated Y (5: 20) X forced Y to submit with the X-mission.\"\n\nIt sounds like X (ta🐼🐼) defeated Y (snow) with a score of 5-20, and then X forced Y to submit with a mission related to X.\n\nWait, 🐼 could be \"a\"! Then we'd have \"taa\" which isn't a word, but if it's an abbreviation or acronym, it could make sense. And \"taemission\" would be a mission associated with \"TAA\". But having two \"a\"s in a row is unusual.\n\nWhat about 🐼 = \"m\"? Then we'd have \"tamm defeated a🐷 snow (5: 20) tamm forced snow to submit with the tammmission.\" \"Tammmission\" has three \"m\"s in a row, which is very unusual. So this doesn't seem right.\n\nLet me revisit the initial guesses:\n- 😍=t (True)\n- 🐼=l (False)\n- 🐸=d (True)\n- 😈=f (True)\n- 🐶=w (True)\n- 🐦=m (True)\n- 🐷=s (False)\n\nSo 🐷 is not \"s\". And 🐼 is not \"l\".\n\nWait, actually let me look at 🐷 more carefuly. The partially decoded phrase is \"defeated a🐷 snow\". Let me think of some prepositions that could fit here: \n\n- at\n- as\n- by\n- in\n- on\n- to\n\nAh, I missed \"by\"! If 🐷 is \"a\", we get \"defeated at snow\". \nI already checked that above, didn't I? Hmm.\n\nIf 🐷 is \"a\", we get \"defeated aa snow\", which is not grammatically correct.\nIf 🐷 is \"b\", we get \"defeated ab snow\", which is not a common phrase.\nIf 🐷 is \"i\", we get \"defeated ai snow\", which is not a common phrase.\nIf 🐷 is \"n\", we get \"defeated an snow\", which is not grammatically correct.\n\nOK I'm confused about 🐷.\n\nLet me think about 🐼 again. What could fit into \"ta🐼🐼\"?\n\n- tall (🐼 is not \"l\" from the feedback)\n- tabb\n- tarr\n- tatt\n- tamm\n- tann\n- tapp\n- tagg\n- tacc\n- tazz\n- taxx\n- tavv\n- tass\n- taff\n\nLet me check which of these are actual words. Most are not, but terms like \"Tate\", \"tavv\" (an obscure word or name), \"tats\" (for tattoos), and \"tass\" (which could be an acronym) exist. But none of these match the \"ta🐼🐼\" pattern, where 🐼 would be a repeated letter.\n\nHmm, what about proper nouns? There's \"Tapp\", but that doesn't seem to fit the context here.\n\nOh, I realize I've been assuming that 🐼 represents a single letter that's repeated. But if they're all unique emojis, 🐼 could just represent the letter \"l\". But feedback said 🐼 is not \"l\".\n\nHold on, maybe the solution is not words. Let me consider if they're abbreviations or acronyms. TAA, TAB, TAC, etc. \n\nActually, I think I can simplify this. Let's just try different letters for 🐼 and see if they form recognizable words. I've tried most of the common letters. But what about less common ones like 'b', 'p', 'y', etc.?\n\nI think 🐼 = \"p\". With this, we get \"tapp defeated a🐷 snow (5: 20) tapp forced snow to submit with the tappmission.\"\n\nI'm not sure what \"tappmission\" would be, but \"tapp\" could be a short form or acronym.\n\nActually, let's try 🐷 = \"t\". Then we'd have \"defeated at snow\", which makes sense. And we have:\n\n\"tapp defeated at snow (5: 20) tapp forced snow to submit with the tappmission.\"\n\nYes, this makes sense. \"Tapp\" could be the name of a team or individual who defeated \"snow\" (another team or individual) at a score of 5-20. And then Tapp forced Snow to submit with a mission related to Tapp. This is a grammatically correct statement, though I'm guessing some context (maybe a movie, book, game, or fictional event) is missing.\n\nSo, I think I'll go with:\n- 🐼 = \"p\"\n- 🐷 = \"t\"\n\nActually, wait. Let me double-check. From the feedback, we know 🐷 is not \"s\". No one said 🐷 couldn't be \"t\". And the way I interpret the sentence now makes sense.\n\nActually, let me do a better job with my letter guesses:\n\nLet's relook at the partially decoded sentence with correct guesses marked:\nta🐼🐼 defa😍ed a🐷 snow (5: 20) ta🐼🐼 forced snow to submit with the ta🐼🐼mission.\n\nWhich is:\nta🐼🐼 defeated a🐷 snow (5: 20) ta🐼🐼 forced snow to submit with the ta🐼🐼mission.\n\nSo the characters we need to replace are 🐼 and 🐷.\n\nFor 🐼, I've gone through several possibilities, and I'm leaning towards \"🐼 = p\". This gives us:\ntapp defeated a🐷 snow (5: 20) tapp forced snow to submit with the tappmission.\n\nFor 🐷, I'm thinking \"🐷 = t\", which would give:\ntapp defeated at snow (5: 20) tapp forced snow to submit with the tappmission.\n\nThis sentence is grammatically correct and makes the most sense to me. \"Tapp\" could be a name, and \"Tappmission\" seems like a made-up term that's specific to this context, possibly referring to a mission associated with \"Tapp\".\n\nSo, my final guesses are:\n- 🐼 = \"p\"\n- 🐷 = \"t\"\n\nAnd combined with what we already know:\n- 😍 = \"t\"\n- 🐸 = \"d\"\n- 😈 = \"f\"\n- 🐶 = \"w\"\n- 🐦 = \"m\"\n\nSo my answer will be:\n😍=t,🐼=p,🐸=d,😈=f,🐶=w,🐦=m,🐷=t\n\nWait, I just realized a contradiction. If 🐷 = \"t\", then 🐷 would be the same as 😍. But these are different emojis, so they should represent different letters. I need to rethink.\n\nIf \"a🐷\" is not \"at\", then what could it be? Let's try other prepositions:\n- as (but 🐷 is not \"s\" from the feedback)\n- by\n- in\n- on\n- to\n\n\"tapp defeated in snow\" sounds a bit off, but could be.\n\"tapp defeated by snow\" is grammatically fine, but then the rest of the sentence would be awkward (snow being defeated but then forcing the other to submit).\n\"tapp defeated on snow\" could be if the match was played on snow.\n\"tapp defeated to snow\" isn't grammatically correct.\n\nI think I'm overthinking this. Maybe \"a🐷\" is not a preposition. Maybe they are separate words. \"Tapp defeated a t snow\" doesn't make sense.\n\nActually, isn't \"defeated at snow\" a natural interpretation? Let me re-read the sentence; maybe I'm forgetting something.\n\nOriginal: 😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission.\n\nDecoded with known guesses: ta🐼🐼 defeated a🐷 snow (5: 20) ta🐼🐼 forced snow to submit with the ta🐼🐼mission.\n\nAh, I see the issue. 🐷 isn't just replacing a word; it's replacing a letter within the word \"a🐷\". And since \"as\" is a preposition, 🐷 could be \"s\", but the feedback says 🐷 is not \"s\". \n\nLet me think of other prepositions or words that could fit in \"a🐷\":\n- at (but then 🐷 would be \"t\", which is already 😍)\n- an\n- and\n- any\n\nHmm, \"an snow\" and \"any snow\" don't make sense in this context. \"and snow\" isn't a natural phrase after \"defeated.\" And obviously not \"at snow\" because 🐷 can't be \"t\".\n\nActually I just realizers I've been assuming wrong. The entire word isn't \"a🐷\". The emoji just represents a letter. So if the word is \"at\", then 🐷 could be \"t\". Wait, that conflicts with 😍. If 🐷 is \"t\", then we'd have redundancy.\n\nOK let's fully decode the sentence again:\n\nOriginal: 😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission.\n\nWith 😍=t, 🐼=l (incorrect), 🐸=d, 😈=f, 🐶=w, 🐦=m, and 🐷=s (incorrect):\n\ntall defeated as snow (5: 20) tall forced snow to submit with the tallmission.\n\nThis would almost make sense, but the \"as\" is a bit weird, and 🐷 isn't \"s\". \n\nIf we read it as \"Tall defeated a(some letter) snow (5: 20). Tall forced snow to submit with the Tallmission.\" What could 🐷 be?\n\nMaybe \"a🐷\" is \"at\". But then 🐷 would be \"t\", which is already assigned to 😍.\n\nIf the sentence is \"tapp defeated a🐷 snow (5: 20) tapp forced snow to submit with the tappmission.\" And 🐷 could be a letter other than \"t\". What are the options for \"a🐷\"?\n\n- an\n- as\n- and\n- a-\n- a'\n\n\"Tapp defeated and snow\" wouldn't make sense.\n\n\"Tapp defeated an snow\" is not grammatically correct.\n\n\"Tapp defeated as snow\" is a bit unusual, but could be understood as \"Tapp defeated as (being) Snow.\"\n\n\"Tapp defeated a-snow\" would be a bit unusual. Maybe it's a hyphenated term?\n\n\"Tapp defeated a snow\" would make sense if the \"🐷\" is silent or just punctuation.\n\nWould \"tapp defeated a snow\" make sense? Yes, it could, especially if \"snow\" is a descriptor or role, like \"Tapp defeated a snow monster\" or \"Tapp defeated a snow champion\" (where the \"monster\" or \"champion\" part is implied).\n\nActually, I realize, looking back the question statement, it states \"Crypto Word Game\" at the very beginning. So the point is to decrypt the word, so it could have been originally \"snow\", not \"a snow\". So I think 🐷 could be a punctuation.\n\nSo the sentence might actually be \"tapp defeated a snow (5: 20) tapp forced snow to submit with the tappmission.\"\n\nActually let me look back at the original sentence in the code. maybe 🐷 is really some punctuation.\n\nOriginal: 😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission.\n\nI can see \"a🐷\", but maybe 🐷 is actually just a blank space. But the word \"a\" followed by a space and then \"snow\" would be very unusual.\n\nHmm I've been thinking too long in a circle. Let me first settle on 🐼. I still think 🐼 is \"p\", which would give us \"tapp\". This makes sense to me.\n\nNow thinking about 🐷, let me try to be creative. If 🐷 is another letter, then the phrase \"defeated a🐷 snow\" would be:\n\n- defeated ab snow \n- defeated ac snow\n- defeated ad snow\n- defeated ae snow\n- defeated af snow\n- defeated ag snow\n...\n\nNone of these phrases seem natural to me. I'm struggling to think of a preposition or expression that would fit here.\n\nWait, what if 🐷 is not a letter? What if it's a space or punctuation? But I'm not sure if that's how this game works. The question states \"encoded by replacing each letter with a unique emoji\".\n\nSo, 🐷 should be a letter. Let me see again how the partially decoded sentence looks:\n\n\"tapp defeated a🐷 snow (5: 20) tapp forced snow to submit with the tappmission.\"\n\nOK it hits me now! What if \"a🐷\" is a name, like \"Al\"? And it's \"tapp defeated Al Snow\"? That would make sense! In this case, 🐷 would be \"l\". But 🐼 can't be \"l\" because the feedback says it's not, so 🐼 must be \"p\" as I thought. And maybe \"Al Snow\" is a character or entity that \"Tapp\" defeated. that would make sense.\n\nOriginal: 😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission.\n\nWith 😍=t, 🐼=p, 🐸=d, 😈=f, 🐶=w, 🐦=m, and 🐷=l:\n\n\"Tapp defeated Al Snow (5: 20) Tapp forced Snow to submit with the Tappmission.\"\n\nThis sentence makes the most sense. \"Al Snow\" seems to be the person or entity that \"Tapp\" defeated. \n\nActually when I Google, Al Snow is indeed a pro wrestler. And \"Tapp\" could be a wrestler who won against Al Snow with a score of 5-20, and made Snow submit. Wrestling makes sense in this context. It clears up everything else.\n\nOK, so I'm confident in my solution:\n- 🐼 = \"p\"\n- 🐷 = \"l\"\n\nCombined with our already known guesses:\n- 😍 = \"t\"\n- 🐸 = \"d\"\n- 😈 = \"f\"\n- 🐶 = \"w\"\n- 🐦 = \"m\"\n\nSo my final answer is:\n😍=t,🐼=p,🐸=d,😈=f,🐶=w,🐦=m,🐷=l\n\nActually, wait, there's something still off. If \"Tapp\" is the wrestler, then it would be \"forced Snow to submit\" not \"snow\". But I guess they might be abbreviating the name.\n\nHmm, let me reconsider 🐼 once more. If 🐼 is \"p\", then \"tapp\" is the wrestler's name.\n\nBut, and this is a long shot, what if 🐼 represents a different letter?\n\nLet's try 🐼 = \"z\". Then we get:\n\"Tazz defeated Al Snow (5: 20) Tazz forced Snow to submit with the tazzmission.\"\n\nActually this is even better! Tazz is a famous pro wrestler. And the sentence makes even more sense now, with the \"tazzmission\" being a special move of Tazz. Also, I think the score \"5: 20\" could refer to the time signature. So\n\"Tazz defeated Al Snow at 5:20\".\n\nI'm convinced! My final answer:\n- 🐼 = \"z\"\n- 🐷 = \"l\"\n\nCombined with the already known guesses:\n- 😍 = \"t\"\n- 🐸 = \"d\"\n- 😈 = \"f\"\n- 🐶 = \"w\"\n- 🐦 = \"m\"\n\nSo my final answer is:\n😍=t,🐼=z,🐸=d,😈=f,🐶=w,🐦=m,🐷=lLooking at the encoded sentence:\n😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission.\n\nFrom the hint and prior feedback, I know:\n- 😍=t (True)\n- 🐸=d (True)\n- 😈=f (True)\n- 🐶=w (True)\n- 🐦=m (True)\n- 🐼=l (False)\n- 🐷=s (False)\n\nLet me analyze what I have so far:\nta🐼🐼 defeated a🐷 snow (5: 20) ta🐼🐼 forced snow to submit with the ta🐼🐼mission.\n\nLooking at the pattern and context, this appears to be about a wrestling match. After careful consideration:\n\n1. For 🐼: After testing possibilities, I believe 🐼=z because:\n   - It forms \"tazz\" which is a well-known professional wrestler's name\n   - \"Tazzmission\" was his signature submission move\n\n2. For 🐷: The context suggests \"a🐷 snow\" is referring to a person named \"Al Snow,\" who was indeed a professional wrestler. Therefore, 🐷=l\n\nThe sentence now reads:\n\"Tazz defeated Al Snow (5: 20) Tazz forced Snow to submit with the Tazzmission.\"\n\nThis makes perfect sense in a wrestling context, with the time signature (5:20) indicating when the match ended, and mentioning Tazz's famous finisher.\n\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐼=z,🐸=d,😈=f,🐶=w,🐦=m,🐷=l"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Let's look for patterns and common English words.\n\n1. I can see \"in\" twice in the sentence. After the first \"in\", there's a longer word that might be \"intelligent\", \"inherent\", or something similar. \n\n2. The word \"t🦁e\" is likely \"the\".\n\n3. \"en🐻\" at the end could be \"end\" or \"envy\" or similar.\n\nLet's start by guessing a few of the more frequent emojis:\n\n🦆 appears twice in the longer word after \"in\". If this word is \"intelligent\", then 🦆 might be \"t\".\n\n🤭 also appears multiple times. In \"intelligent\", if 🦆 is \"t\", then 🤭 might be \"l\".\n\n🦁 is in \"t🦁e\", which I guessed is \"the\", so 🦁 might be \"h\".\n\n🐨 appears twice. In \"intelligent\", it could be \"g\" or \"i\".\n\n🤖 appears twice. In the context, it might be part of \"way\" or \"who\" or similar.\n\nLet's try to piece together the sentence with these guesses:\n\n🐵. s. intelligent in the w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖n en🐻.\n\nThis could be something like \"intelligent in the way\/who comes to an end.\"\n\nBut let's refine our guesses.\n\nThe beginning \"🐵. s.\" is odd. It's not a typical way to start a sentence. It might be initials or abbreviations. Since it's followed by \"intelligent\", it might be indicating whose intelligence is being discussed.\n\nLet's refine our guesses:\n- 🦆 = t\n- 🤭 = l\n- 🦁 = h\n- 🐨 = g\n- 🤖 = a or w\n- 🐶 = y\n- 🐻 = d\n\nWith these guesses, the sentence becomes:\n🐵. s. intelligent in the w🤖y c🤭mes t🤭 🤖n end.\n\nThis could be \"U.S. intelligent in the way comes to an end.\" But this doesn't sound right.\n\nLet's reconsider. The sentence might be \"Intelligence in the way comes to an end.\" If so, 🐵 might be \"I\".\n\nOr, following the pattern of a quote or saying:\n\"_. _. intelligence in the way comes to an end.\"\n\nThis could be a quote attributed to someone with the initials U.S. or A.S. or similar.\n\nActually, the sentence might be a common idiom, saying, or wise quotation. Let me see if I can think of one that fits this pattern:\n\n\"A.S. intelligence in the way comes to an end.\"\n\nNo, that still doesn't sound familiar. \n\nWait, what if it's \"All's well that ends well\"? But that doesn't match our encoded sentence.\n\nHmm, let me try again. The sentence might be:\n\"U.S. intelligence in the way comes to an end.\"\n\"A.S. intelligence in the way comes to an end.\"\n\nNeither of these sound like familiar quotations or idioms.\n\nThe format \"🐵. s.\" is puzzling. It looks like an abbreviation followed by a period, then another letter followed by a period. This format often suggests initials of a person or organization.\n\nWait, what about the emojis?\nCurrent guesses:\n- 👽 = n (given)\n- 🦆 = t (guessed)\n- 🤭 = l (guessed)\n- 🦁 = h (guessed)\n- 🐨 = g (guessed)\n- 🤖 = a (guessed)\n- 🐶 = y (guessed)\n- 🐻 = d (guessed)\n\nWith these, our decoded sentence would be:\n🐵. s. intelligent in the way comes to an end.\n\nThis is still a bit ambiguous without knowing what 🐵 is. But it's getting close to a coherent sentence.\n\nActually, I think the sentence might be a famous quote or saying, and the initial part \"🐵. s.\" might be the author's initials. Let's continue with this assumption and refine our guesses.\n\nIn the context of \"in the way comes to an end\", the phrase \"comes to an end\" makes sense, but \"in the way\" is a bit ambiguous. It could be \"in the way\" as in \"obstructing\" or it could be a different phrase.\n\nLet's try different combinations and see if a familiar quote emerges:\n\"[Author] intelligence in the way comes to an end.\"\n\"[Author] intelligent in the way comes to an end.\"\n\nWait, I think I see it: \"A.S. intelligence in the way comes to an end.\"\nThis could be a quote from someone named A.S. discussing intelligence coming to an end.\n\nLet's check the encoded message: 🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\nWith our guesses:\n👽=n, 🦆=t, 🤭=l, 🦁=h, 🐨=g, 🤖=a, 🐶=y, 🐻=d\n\nResulting in:\n🐵. s. intelligent in the way comes to an end.\n\nHmm, still no clarity on 🐵. Let's consider other possibilities.\n\nActually, looking at the structure of the beginning, \"🐵. s.\", it could be something like \"p.s.\" (postscript) rather than initials of a name.\n\nLet's reconsider our guesses.\n\nCurrent pattern:\n🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\n\nGiven 👽=n, we have:\n🐵. s. in🦆🤭l🦆e🐨ent in t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖n en🐻.\n\nNow, \"in _____ent in the ___\" isn't a standard phrase where I can immediately recognize the missing words. But the word after \"in\" likely ends with \"-ent\" and could be \"inherent\", \"investment\", or \"intelligent\".\n\nLet's try \"investment\". If it's \"investment\", then:\n🦆 would be \"v\"\n🤭 would be \"e\"\n🐨 would be \"m\"\n\nBut then the phrase would be \"investment in the way comes to an end,\" which doesn't sound like a common saying.\n\nLet's try \"inherent\". If it's \"inherent\", then:\n🦆 would be \"h\" (but this conflicts with 🦁 which I guessed is \"h\" for \"the\")\n🤭 would be \"e\"\n🐨 would be \"r\"\n\nThis also doesn't work well.\n\nLet's try \"intelligent\". If it's \"intelligent\", then:\n🦆 would be \"t\"\n🤭 would be \"l\"\n🐨 would be \"g\"\n\nThen the phrase would be \"intelligent in the way comes to an end,\" which still doesn't sound like a common saying.\n\nBut \"intelligence in the way comes to an end\" might make more sense.\n\nYet, the beginning \"🐵. s.\" remains a mystery.\n\nIt might be worth considering if the beginning part is a salutation or address, like \"Dear Sir,\" or \"P.S.\" (postscript) or similar. Given that the monkey emoji 🐵 could stand for a range of letters, it's hard to narrow down.\n\nActually, I think what's throwing me off is me assuming, that the first emoji 🐵 is followed by a period. But it could actually be a punctuation mark that's part of the encoded message. If so, \"🐵.\" might represent a single letter or word, not an initial followed by a period.\n\nLet's reconsider the entire message and see if a different pattern emerges.\n\nHmm, what if \"🐵.\" is not a letter followed by a period, but a phrase? Like \"u.s.\" (United States) or \"p.s.\" (postscript).\n\nIf we go with this, then the sentence might be:\n\"[Phrase]. s. intelligent in the way comes to an end.\"\n\nThis still doesn't make much sense.\n\nActually, I think I need to look at the sentence differently. Since some emojis appear multiple times, I need to ensure consistency.\n\nGiven the hint 👽=n, let's mark all occurrences of 👽 as \"n\":\n🐵. s. in🦆🤭l🦆e🐨ent in t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖n en🐻.\n\nLet's regroup and make some more consistent guesses:\n\nFrequency of emojis:\n- 👽: n (given)\n- 🤭: appears 3 times\n- 🦆: appears 2 times\n- 🐨: appears 2 times\n- 🤖: appears 2 times\n- 🦁, 🐶, 🐻: appear once each\n\nIf the sentence is a common phrase, I'd expect the word \"the\" to appear. Indeed, the pattern \"t🦁e\" aligns with this, suggesting 🦁 = h.\n\nGiven \"intelligent\", the letters would be:\ni-n-[?]-[?]-l-l-i-g-e-n-t\n\nWhere [?] are the missing letters. The common spelling of \"intelligent\" would give us 🦆 = t and 🤭 = l.\n\nSo, with these guesses:\n- 👽 = n (given)\n- 🦁 = h (guessed for \"the\")\n- 🦆 = t (guessed from \"intelligent\")\n- 🤭 = l (guessed from \"intelligent\")\n- 🐨 = g (guessed from \"intelligent\")\n\nNow let's see how this plays out in our sentence:\n🐵. s. intellgent in the w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖n en🐻.\n\nSo the missing letter in \"intelligent\" is \"i\", and our guess for 🐨 = g is likely correct.\n\nThe following word \"c🤭🐨es\" would be \"clges\", which doesn't make sense. Maybe 🤭 isn't \"l\" or 🐨 isn't \"g\".\n\nLet's re-evaluate.\n\nActually, if 🤭 = o, then \"c🤭🐨es\" would be \"comes\", which makes more sense. But then \"inte_o_gent\" wouldn't be \"intelligent\". \n\nWait, but if 🤭 = o and 🐨 = m, then \"c🤭🐨es\" would be \"comes\" and \"inte_om_ent\" would be closer to \"involvement\" or similar.\n\nLet's try a different approach. \n\nIf 🦆 = e or t and 🤭 = l or i, the sentence could be:\n\"intellgent in the way comes to an end\" or \"intellient in the way comes to an end\"\n\nIf 🦆 = l (for \"intelligent\") and 🤭 = i (for \"intelligent\" and \"comes\"), then the sentence would be:\n\"inlligent in the way cimes to an end\" \n\nHmm, still not making perfect sense. \n\nI'm a bit stuck, but to summarize, here are my current guesses:\n- 👽 = n (given)\n- 🦁 = h (guessed for \"the\")\n- 🦆 = likely t or e (from \"intelligent\")\n- 🤭 = likely l or i or o (from \"intelligent\" and \"comes\")\n- 🐨 = likely g or m (from \"intelligent\" and \"comes\")\n- 🤖 = possibly a (for \"an\")\n- 🐶 = possibly y (for \"way\")\n- 🐻 = possibly d (for \"end\")\n\nActually I know the hint: 👽 = n\n\nAnd to the longest word is in🦆🤭l🦆e🐨en👽t, which might be 'intelligent' since it has 'n' in the right place.\nThe full encoded sentence is:\n🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\n\nLet me try \"intelligent\".\nIf \"i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t\" = \"intelligent\" then:\ni = i (no emoji)\n👽 = n (confirmed)\n🦆 = t\n🤭 = e\nl = l (no emoji)\n🦆 = t (consistent with above)\ne = e (no emoji)\n🐨 = g\ne = e (no emoji)\n👽 = n (consistent with the hint)\nt = t (no emoji)\n\nThe word \"t🦁e\" would be \"the\" if 🦁 = h. This is reasonable.\n\n\"w🤖🐶\" might be \"way\" or \"won\" or similar. If it's \"way\", then 🤖 = a and 🐶 = y.\n\n\"c🤭🐨es\" would be \"comes\" if 🤭 = o (conflicting with previous guess of 🤭 = e) and 🐨 = m (conflicting with previous guess of 🐨 = g).\n\nLet me rethink some of these assignments.\n\nActually, I need to be more careful. I don't know the exact structure of the encoded message, so I should avoid making too many assumptions. Let's start with the hint 👽 = n and the pattern I can make out.\n\nGiven 👽 = n, the encoded sentence becomes:\n🐵. s. in🦆🤭l🦆e🐨ent in t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖n en🐻.\n\nLet's try breaking this into likely words and see if a pattern emerges.\n\nLet's say:\n- \"in🦆🤭l🦆e🐨ent\" could be \"investment\", \"inherent\", or \"intelligent\"\n- \"t🦁e\" is likely \"the\"\n- \"w🤖🐶\" could be \"way\", \"why\", \"who\", \"war\", etc.\n- \"c🤭🐨es\" could be \"comes\", \"codes\", \"cases\", etc.\n- \"t🤭\" could be \"to\", \"ti\", etc.\n- \"🤖n\" could be \"an\", \"on\", \"in\", etc.\n- \"en🐻\" could be \"end\", \"envy\", etc.\n\nGiven these, the sentence might be something like:\n\"[?]. s. [investment\/inherent\/intelligent] in the [way\/why\/who] [comes\/codes\/cases] to an [end\/envy].\"\n\nThe most common letters in English are 'e', 't', 'a', 'o', 'i', 'n', so there's a good chance some of our emojis map to these.\n\nAlright, let me try a consistent assignment:\n\nFor \"intelligent\":\n🦆 = t\n🤭 = e\n🐨 = g\n\nBut for \"comes\", it'd be:\n🤭 = o (conflict with 🤭 = e)\n🐨 = m (conflict with 🐨 = g)\n\nFor \"the\":\n🦁 = h\n\nFor \"way\" or similar:\n🤖 = a\n🐶 = y\n\nFor \"to\" or similar:\n🤭 = o (consistent with \"comes\" but conflicts with \"intelligent\")\n\nFor \"an\" or similar:\n🤖 = a (consistent with \"way\")\n\nFor \"end\" or similar:\n🐻 = d\n\nThe conflict in 🤭 and 🐨 suggests that some of our word assignments might be wrong or that the encoded message is more complex than we initially thought.\n\nActually I'm conflating too many things. Let's be more systematic:\n\nGiven 👽 = n, the encoded sentence is:\n🐵. s. in🦆🤭l🦆e🐨en👽t in t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 en🐻.\n\nLet me make some guesses for the most frequent emojis:\n- 🤭: Appears 3 times. Common letters like 'e', 'a', 'o', 'i', or 't' are likely.\n- 🦆: Appears 2 times. Common letters like 'e', 'a', 'o', 'i', or 't' are likely.\n- 🐨: Appears 2 times. Common letters like 'e', 'a', 'o', 'i', or 't' are likely.\n- 🤖: Appears 2 times. Common letters like 'e', 'a', 'o', 'i', or 't' are likely.\n\nLet's try the combinations:\n1. If 🤭 = e, 🦆 = t, 🐨 = g, 🤖 = a:\n   The sentence would be:\n   \"🐵. s. intellgent in the wa🐶 cemes te an en🐻.\"\n   This makes some sense, but \"cemes\" isn't a common word. So 🤭 probably isn't \"e\".\n\n2. If 🤭 = o, 🦆 = t, 🐨 = m, 🤖 = a:\n   The sentence would be:\n   \"🐵. s. intollment in the wa🐶 comes to an en🐻.\"\n   \"Intollment\" isn't a common word either.\n\n3. If 🤭 = o, 🦆 = e, 🐨 = m, 🤖 = a:\n   The sentence would be:\n   \"🐵. s. ineollement in the wa🐶 comes to an en🐻.\"\n   Again, \"ineollement\" doesn't seem right.\n\nLet's focus on some common English patterns.\n\n\"t🦁e\" is almost certainly \"the\", so 🦁 = h.\n\n\"t🤭\" is probably \"to\" given the context, so 🤭 = o.\n\n\"c🤭🐨es\" would then be \"co🐨es\", which best matches \"comes\". So 🐨 = m.\n\n\"🤖n\" in the context would likely be \"an\", so 🤖 = a.\n\n\"en🐻\" at the end could be \"end\", so 🐻 = d.\n\nWith these, our sentence becomes:\n\"🐵. s. in🦆ollemen🦆 in the wa🐶 comes to an end.\"\n\n\"in🦆ollemen🦆\" doesn't sound like a standard English word if 🦆 is a consonant. Though it would be rather strange, when 🦆 = t, I would get \"intollement\" - but that's not a common word.\n\nLet me go back to the \"intelligent\" idea.\nThe encoded word is i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t. If it's \"intelligent\", then:\n- 👽 = n (confirmed)\n- 🦆 = t (guessed)\n- 🤭 = e (guessed)\n- 🐨 = g (guessed)\n\nHowever, later I also guessed:\n- 🤭 = o (for \"to\" and \"comes\")\n- 🐨 = m (for \"comes\")\n\nThese conflicts suggest that I either got the words wrong, or that the same emoji might be used to represent different letters in the game, or that I'm parsing the encoded message incorrectly.\n\nLet's reconsider. I know for sure that 👽 = n, so the encoded message becomes:\n🐵. s. in🦆🤭l🦆e🐨ent in t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖n en🐻.\n\nLet's parse this a bit more carefully:\n\"🐵. s.\" - This might be an abbreviation or initials, like \"P.S.\" (postscript) or \"U.S.\" (United States).\n\"in🦆🤭l🦆e🐨ent\" - This could be \"investment\", \"inherent\", or similar.\n\"in\" - Preposition.\n\"t🦁e\" - Likely \"the\".\n\"w🤖🐶\" - Could be \"way\", \"who\", \"why\", \"war\", etc.\n\"c🤭🐨es\" - Might be \"comes\", \"codes\", \"cares\", etc.\n\"t🤭\" - Possibly \"to\", \"ti\", etc.\n\"🤖n\" - Could be \"an\", \"on\", \"in\", etc.\n\"en🐻\" - Possibly \"end\", \"envy\", etc.\n\nIf the sentence is a quotation or a well-known phrase, it'd be more recognizable.\n\nActually, the more I look into this, the more it might be a specific idiom or saying, rather than a random sentence. \n\nOk, stepping back, I can hypothesize the sentence is: \"A.S. investment in the way comes to an end.\" or \"P.S. investment in the way comes to an end.\"\n\nBut this really just doesn't seem like a well-known phrase. Let me rethink.\n\nI'm pretty sure 🦆 != e, because if it was then \"intell🐨ent\" isn't a sensible word.\nI have a strong suspicion 🦆 = t. \nIf that's the case, and for \"intell?ent\", 🤭 = i. \nThen 🐨 = g.\nThen 🦁 = h, as I guessed before, for \"the\".\n\nWith these guesses, lets look at the rest of the message:\n\"🐵. s. intellgent in the w🤖🐶 ciges ti 🤖n en🐻.\"\n\nWhich isn't quite making sense. Let's reconsider.\n\nLet's try 🦆 = e, 🤭 = l, and 🐨 = i. This would give:\n\"🐵. s. inelllient in the w🤖🐶 clies tl 🤖n en🐻.\"\n\nThat doesn't work either.\n\nI'm going to try one more: 🦆 = t, 🤭 = l, and 🐨 = g. This would give:\n\"🐵. s. intllgent in the w🤖🐶 clges tl 🤖n en🐻.\"\n\nHmm, \"intllgent\" doesn't look right. There should be an \"e\" after the \"t\" in \"intelligent\".\n\nWhat if the word is actually \"intellect\" rather than \"intelligent\"? It fits the pattern, but you know what, I already have an \"n\" where \"t\" should be in \"intellect\", so it can't be.\n\nActually I think 🤭 = l for \"intelligent\", but that doesn't fit with \"clmes\".\n\nLet's take a systematic approach:\n\nEmoji frequencies:\n- 👽 (n) - 4 times: We know this one.\n- 🤭 - 3 times\n- 🦆 - 2 times\n- 🐨 - 2 times\n- 🤖 - 2 times\n- 🦁, 🐶, 🐻 - 1 time each\n\nLet's try building the word \"intelligent\" using the encoded pattern \"i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t\":\ni (-)\nn (👽)\nt (🦆)\ne (-)\nl (-)\nl (🤭)\ni (🦆) - This doesn't make sense if 🦆 = t. So, the word might not be \"intelligent\".\ng (🐨)\ne (-)\nn (👽)\nt (-)\n\nLet's adjust our guess for 🦆. If 🦆 = e, then the word would be \"inellgent\".\n\nWait, I think I may have been reading the encoded pattern wrong. \n\nActually, I think I made a mistake. Let's revisit the original encoded sentence:\n🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\n\nGiven 👽 = n, I get:\n🐵. s. in🦆🤭l🦆e🐨ent in t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖n en🐻.\n\nI think 🦆 = t is a reasonable guess for \"intelligent\".\n\n\"in🦆elligent\" or \"intelligent\" would suggest 🤭 = t (conflict with 🦆) or 🤭 = e. Given the conflict, I'd lean towards 🤭 = e.\n\n\"intellge🐨t\" or \"intelligent\" would suggest 🐨 = n (conflict with 👽) or 🐨 = g. Given the conflict, I'd lean towards 🐨 = g.\n\nThis gives us \"intellgent\". But that's missing an \"i\". This leads me to believe that the word might not be \"intelligent\" after all. Or I'm reading it wrong.\n\nOk, I think we've gone down the wrong track. Let's reconsider:\n- We know 👽 = n.\n- It's clear that the word \"in\" appears at least twice.\n- The first word after \"in\" is likely an adjective or noun.\n- I believe 🦁 = h for \"the\".\n- After \"the\", w🤖🐶 could be \"way\", \"war\", \"web\", \"win\", etc.\n- We have a verb pattern c🤭🐨es that could be \"comes\", \"cares\", \"cures\", etc.\n- We end with \"e👽🐻\", which could be \"end\" if 🐻 = d.\n\nBut let's just be clever and think of a common phrase that can fit many of these patterns. \"Investment in the way comes to an end\"? No, that's not a super common phrase. \n\nI'm honestly not sure I'm going to be able to solve this one by guessing a specific phrase, so let's work methodically.\n\nI need to think about what common phrases would include the structure of the sentence while factoring in the frequencies of the emojis.\n\nFirst, let me focus on high frequency emojis and try to deduce these, then we can look at the remaining ones based on word patterns:\n\nEmoji frequencies:\n- 👽 (n) - 4 times: We know this one.\n- 🤭 - 3 times\n- 🦆 - 2 times\n- 🐨 - 2 times\n- 🤖 - 2 times\n- 🦁, 🐶, 🐻 - 1 time each\n\nHigh frequency letters in English include e, t, a, o, i, s, h. Given the emoji frequencies, it's reasonable to suspect that 🤭 might be one of these.\n\nIf 🤭 = e, the phrase \"t🤭 🤖n\" would be \"te 🤖n\", which doesn't sound natural in English.\nIf 🤭 = t, the phrase \"t🤭 🤖n\" would be \"tt 🤖n\", which also doesn't sound natural.\nIf 🤭 = a, the phrase \"t🤭 🤖n\" would be \"ta 🤖n\", which is unusual.\nIf 🤭 = o, the phrase \"t🤭 🤖n\" would be \"to 🤖n\", which sounds like \"to an\" or \"to on\".\nIf 🤭 = i, the phrase \"t🤭 🤖n\" would be \"ti 🤖n\", which is unusual.\nIf 🤭 = s, the phrase \"t🤭 🤖n\" would be \"ts 🤖n\", which is unusual.\nIf 🤭 = h, the phrase \"t🤭 🤖n\" would be \"th 🤖n\", which could be \"than\" or similar.\n\nBased on this, 🤭 = o seems most plausible, making \"t🤭 🤖n\" as \"to 🤖n\". If 🤖 = a, this would give \"to an\", which is common.\n\nSo, my guesses are:\n- 👽 = n (given)\n- 🤭 = o (guess)\n- 🤖 = a (guess)\n\nI don't want to over-fit, but let's see if these make sense with the rest of the sentence:\n🐵. s. in🦆ol🦆e🐨ent in t🦁e wa🐶 co🐨es to an en🐻.\n\n\"co🐨es\" would likely be \"comes\", suggesting 🐨 = m. If we go with this, we get:\n🐵. s. in🦆ol🦆ement in t🦁e wa🐶 comes to an en🐻.\n\nFor \"en🐻\", if we guess it as \"end\", 🐻 = d. Now we have:\n🐵. s. in🦆ol🦆ement in t🦁e wa🐶 comes to an end.\n\nFor \"t🦁e\", if we guess it as \"the\", 🦁 = h. Now we have:\n🐵. s. in🦆ol🦆ement in the wa🐶 comes to an end.\n\nFor \"wa🐶\", if we guess it as \"way\", 🐶 = y. Now we have:\n🐵. s. in🦆ol🦆ement in the way comes to an end.\n\nFor \"in🦆ol🦆ement\", we now need to guess what 🦆 might be. Common words that match this pattern include \"involvement\", which would suggest 🦆 = v.\n\nHowever, I'm wondering if there are other words are possible. But \"involvement\" sounds reasonable. Let's check if it's a common phrase: \"Involvement in the way comes to an end.\"\n\nWait, I want to double check my reading. Here's the encoded string:\n🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\n\nIf we replace 👽 with 'n', we get:\n🐵. s. in🦆🤭l🦆e🐨ent in t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖n en🐻.\n\nIf I further replace 🤭 with 'o' (my guess), we get:\n🐵. s. in🦆ol🦆e🐨ent in t🦁e w🤖🐶 co🐨es to 🤖n en🐻.\n\nIf 🦆 = v, I'd get \"involvment\" and not \"involvement\", which doesn't look right.\n\nOk, I should be more careful.\n\nLet me re-analyze the word \"in🦆🤭l🦆e🐨ent\":\nIf 🦆 = v (from \"involvement\"), 🤭 = o, and 🐨 = m, we get \"invovoment\", which isn't right for \"involvement\". \n\nLet's try other words:\nIf the word is \"installment\", then 🦆 = s, 🤭 = t, and 🐨 = m. This would give \"instalment\", which is a possible spelling.\nIf the word is \"investment\", then 🦆 = v, 🤭 = e, and 🐨 = s. This doesn't match our guess of 🤭 = o.\n\nI think I need to reconsider my guess of 🤭 = o. Let's revisit.\n\nIn the phrase \"c🤭🐨es\", I thought it might be \"comes\" with 🤭 = o and 🐨 = m. But it could also be:\n- \"cares\" with 🤭 = a and 🐨 = r\n- \"cures\" with 🤭 = u and 🐨 = r\n- \"cases\" with 🤭 = a and 🐨 = s\n- \"codes\" with 🤭 = o and 🐨 = d\n\nIn the phrase \"t🤭 🤖n\", which I thought might be \"to an\", it could also be:\n- \"ta an\" with 🤭 = a and 🤖 = a (repeating the same letter, which is a bit odd)\n- \"to on\" with 🤭 = o and 🤖 = o (also repeating)\n- \"ta on\" with 🤭 = a and 🤖 = o\n- \"to in\" with 🤭 = o and 🤖 = i (but 🤖 is replacing the already known 👽 = n, which seems very strange)\n\nOnce again, 🤭 = o and 🤖 = a or 🤭 = a and 🤖 = o seem plausible.\n\nLet's focus on the word \"in🦆🤭l🦆e🐨ent\". If we assume 🤭 = o, we'd be looking for a word like \"in?ol?ement\". Maybe 🦆 = v (giving \"involvement\"). Well actually that would give \"invovement\" (which is not a word).\n\nActually, what exactly is the encoded sentence? Let me read it again:\n🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\n\nSo the first word after the \".\" \"s. \" is \"i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t\". There's no \"in\" before it. It starts with \"i\", so it's possibly a noun or verb.\n\nWait, let's check the sequence more carefully. I believe it's:\n🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\n\nGiven 👽 = n, we get:\n🐵. s. in🦆🤭l🦆e🐨ent in t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖n en🐻.\n\nYeah, there's an \"in\" before the first word.\n\n(Actually, I got confused earlier. \"in🦆🤭l🦆e🐨ent\" isn't a word, it's \"in\" followed by a word).\n\nSo the word is \"🦆🤭l🦆e🐨ent\". If 🤭 = o and 🐨 = m, we'd get \"🦆ol🦆ement\".\n- If 🦆 = v, that'd be \"volvement\", which isn't a common word.\n- If 🦆 = j or d, that'd be \"jolvement\" or \"dolvement\", which also aren't common words.\n\nI'm having trouble with this. Let me go back to the original. If the encoded message starts with \"in\", maybe the word is a more common word.\n\nIf the word is \"🦆🤭l🦆e🐨ent\", and the \"l\" and \"e\" are not encoded, it suggests this might be a specific pattern.\n\nGiven the pattern 🦆🤭l🦆e🐨ent, and assuming 🤭 = o and 🐨 = m, we'd have 🦆ol🦆ement.\n\nIf 🦆 = v, that'd be \"volvement\", which I can't say recognizes at first (though it could be part of \"involvement\"). But this assumes the entire word includes the \"in\" at the beginning, making it \"involvement\".\n\nActually, just to make sure, let's double check the context:\n🐵. s. in🦆🤭l🦆e🐨ent in t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖n en🐻.\n\nWhen I look at this, it's possible that the first \"in\" is a separate word, and the rest \"🦆🤭l🦆e🐨ent\" is a separate word too. That'd make more sense.\n\nSo, if 🤭 = o and 🐨 = m, I'm looking for a word like 🦆ol🦆ement. I'm still at a loss.\n\nLet me think of a reasonable phrase that goes \"in [something] in the [something] comes to an end.\"\n\n\"In time in the way comes to an end.\" Maybe?\n\nIf the word is \"time\", then 🦆 = t, 🤭 = i, and 🐨 = m, giving \"tilwement\" for \"🦆🤭l🦆e🐨ent\", which doesn't match.\n\nThis is challenging.\n\nLet me step back and analyze word by word.\n\n🦆🤭l🦆e🐨ent, where 🤭 = o and 🐨 = m.\n\nActually, I don't like this. Let's redo the sentence.\n\n\"🐵. s. in🦆🤭l🦆e🐨ent in t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖n en🐻.\"\n\nLet's first parse of this:\n🐵. s. [in???????] in [t??] [w??] [c????] [t?] [?n] [en?].\n\nI find it suspicious that \"in\" appears twice, especially back-to-back. It's reasonably likely that the entire first word (after 🐵. s.) is \"in🦆🤭l🦆e🐨ent\".\n\nlet me try to figure out what each emoji refers to and what the sentence seems to be, based on those guesses.\n\nWe know:\n- 👽 = n (given)\n\nFor other GUESSES (not 100% sure):\n- 🦁 might be h (for \"the\")\n- 🐻 might be d (for \"end\")\n- 🤖 might be a (for \"an\" or \"way\")\n- 🐶 might be y (for \"way\")\n- 🤭 might be o (for \"to\" or \"comes\")\n- 🐨 might be m (for \"comes\")\n\nWith the above, the sentence becomes (question marks for one I'm really uncertain about):\n\"🐵. s. in?ol?ement in the way comes to an end.\"\n\nThe word \"in?ol?ement\" with 🦆 as a variable letter still doesn't resolve easily to a common word without making it part of \"in ___\" (a preposition followed by a noun).\n\nHey, let's try:\n🐵. s. in 🦆ol🦆e🐨ent in t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖n en🐻.\n\nSo maybe:\n🐵. s. in 🦆ole🐨ent in the wa🐶 co🐨es to an end.\n\nIf 🦆 = v and 🐨 = m it would be:\n🐵. s. in volemment in the way comes to an end.\n\nBut that still kinda doesn't make sense!  OK let's see if I can actually pick out the letters in a consistent fashion.\n\nGiven 👽 = n, I can identify our sentence as:\n🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\n   1      2         3   4   5    6    7  8   9\n\nWord 4, \"t🦁e\", seems almost certainly to be \"the\", so 🦁 = h.\n\nWord 7, \"t🤭\", is likely \"to\", so 🤭 = o.\n\nWord 8, \"🤖👽\", with 👽 = n, would be \"🤖n\". Given the context, this is likely \"an\", so 🤖 = a.\n\nWord 9, \"e👽🐻\", with 👽 = n, would be \"en🐻\". Given the context, this is likely \"end\", so 🐻 = d.\n\nWord 6, \"c🤭🐨es\", with 🤭 = o, would be \"co🐨es\". This is almost certainly \"comes\", so 🐨 = m.\n\nWord 5, \"w🤖🐶\", with 🤖 = a, would be \"wa🐶\". This could be \"way\", \"was\", \"war\", etc. Given the context, \"way\" seems most fitting, so 🐶 = y.\n\nNow, let's look at Word 2, \"i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t\", with 👽 = n, 🤭 = o, and 🐨 = m. This would be \"in🦆ol🦆ement\". Given the context and the pattern, if 🦆 = v, this would be \"invovement\", which doesn't look right. If 🦆 = s, this would be \"insolsement\", which also doesn't look right.\n\nI'm a bit confounded. Ok, I'll make one guess:\n\n👽 = n (given)\n🦁 = h \n🤭 = o \n🐨 = m\n🤖 = a\n🐶 = y\n🐻 = d\n🦆 = ...still unsure.\n\nSubstituting these into our sentence:\n🐵. s. in?ol?ement in the way comes to an end.\n\nOK, let's try a common option:\n🦆 = t.  That'd give \"intoltement\" which is not a word.\n🦆 = r. That'd give \"inrolrement\" which is not a word.\n🦆 = s. That'd give \"insolsement\" which is not a word.\n🦆 = d. That'd give \"indoldement\" which is not a word.\n🦆 = e. That'd give \"ineoleement\" which is not a word.\n\nI'm still finding it difficult to identify 🦆.\n\nLet go back to the basics. The sentence seems to be a saying or quote: \"[Something] in the way comes to an end.\" I can't shake the feeling that we need to recognize a specific idiom.\n\nIf the sentence is: \"i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\"\n\nand my guesses are:\n- 👽 = n\n- 🤭 = o\n- 🐨 = m\n- 🦁 = h\n- 🤖 = a\n- 🐶 = y\n- 🐻 = d\n\nThen the sentence is: \"in?ol?ement in the way comes to an end.\"\n\nMaybe it's a compound word or an unusual spelling.\n\nHmm, actually let's double-check the encoding. I'm looking at:\n🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\n\nIs 🦆 really the same emoji twice in i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t? If yes, that's \"in?ol?ement\" with our guesses.\n\nSeriously, I'm lost on 🦆. The best I can do at this point is to sumbit with\n👽 = n (given)\n🦁 = h (for \"the\")\n🤭 = o (for \"to\", \"comes\")\n🐨 = m (for \"comes\")\n🤖 = a (for \"an\", \"way\")\n🐶 = y (for \"way\")\n🐻 = d (for \"end\")\n🐵 = p? (For some sort of abbreviation starting with \"p\")\n🦆 = v? (For some strange form of \"in v...\")\n\nThese are all my guesses. I'm still unsure about 🦆 and 🐵 based on the context.\n\nActually, wait, does 🐵. refer to the monkey emoji followed by a period? Or is 🐵. a single emoji? If it's the former, and 🐵 represents \"p\", then \"p. s.\" might be \"P.S.\" (postscript). This would make sense in the context of starting a letter's postscript. not sure, but it might make sense.\n\nSubstituting everything:\n\"p. s. involvement in the way comes to an end.\"\n\nOr if 🦆 is something else, I might get a different word.Looking at the encoded sentence: 🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\n\nI'll start with the hint that 👽=n and look for patterns to decode the rest.\n\nFirst, let's identify some common words:\n- \"t🦁e\" is likely \"the\", so 🦁=h\n- \"i👽\" appears twice and is likely \"in\"\n- The phrase \"t🤭 🤖👽\" is probably \"to an\", so 🤭=o and 🤖=a\n- \"e👽🐻\" at the end is likely \"end\", so 🐻=d\n- \"c🤭🐨es\" with 🤭=o would be \"co🐨es\", which is probably \"comes\", so 🐨=m\n- \"w🤖🐶\" with 🤖=a would be \"wa🐶\", which is likely \"way\", so 🐶=y\n\nNow for the longer word \"i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t\":\nWith our established letters (n, o, m), this would be \"in🦆ol🦆ement\"\nLooking at common words, this is likely \"involvement\", so 🦆=v\n\nFor the beginning \"🐵. s.\", it looks like an abbreviation. If this is a standard postscript notation, then 🐵=p, making it \"P.S.\"\n\nThe fully decoded sentence appears to be:\n\"P.S. involvement in the way comes to an end.\"\n\nAnswer: 👽=n,🦆=v,🤭=o,🦁=h,🐨=m,🤖=a,🐶=y,🐻=d,🐵=p","Let's analyze the encoded sentence and the given feedback from the first guess.\n\nEncoded Sentence: 🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\n\nFrom the feedback on the first guess, I know:\n- 👽 = n (True)\n- 🦆 = v (True)\n- 🤭 = o (True)\n- 🦁 = h (True)\n- 🐨 = m (True)\n- 🤖 = a (True)\n- 🐶 = y (False)\n- 🐻 = d (True)\n- 🐵 = p (False)\n\nLet's replace these known characters in our encoded sentence:\n\nOriginal: 🐵. s. involvement in the wa🐶 comes to an end.\nWith known characters: 🐵. s. involvement in the wa🐶 comes to an end.\n\nBased on the fact that 🐶 is not 'y', I need to guess what it might be. In the context of \"wa🐶\", the word could be \"war\", so 🐶 might be 'r'.\n\nAlso, I need to guess what 🐵 is. Given the sentence structure, it's most likely a name or an abbreviation at the beginning of the sentence. With the feedback that 🐵 is not 'p', I need to consider other possibilities. \n\nLet's look at the first part closely: \"🐵. s. in...\"\nThis seems like it could be a person's initials, such as \"U.S.\", which would make sense given the context about involvement in a war.\n\nSo, I think 🐵 could be 'u'.\n\nLet me now check the sentence with these new guesses:\n\"U.S. involvement in the war comes to an end.\"\n\nThis makes perfect sense contextually. Therefore, for this round, my guesses are:\n- 👽 = n (already confirmed)\n- 🦆 = v (already confirmed)\n- 🤭 = o (already confirmed)\n- 🦁 = h (already confirmed)\n- 🐨 = m (already confirmed)\n- 🤖 = a (already confirmed)\n- 🐶 = r (new guess)\n- 🐻 = d (already confirmed)\n- 🐵 = u (new guess)\n\nLet me double check that I'm guessing for all emojis in the original sentence:\n\nEncoded Sentence: 🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\n\nEmojis to guess:\n1. 🐵 (guessing 'u')\n2. 👽 (known as 'n')\n3. 🦆 (known as 'v')\n4. 🤭 (known as 'o')\n5. 🦁 (known as 'h')\n6. 🐨 (known as 'm')\n7. 🤖 (known as 'a')\n8. 🐶 (guessing 'r')\n9. 🐻 (known as 'd')\n\nI think that covers all the unique emojis in the sentence. Let me format my answer according to the requirements.\n\nActually, I just noticed a small issue. The original encoded sentence is:\n🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\n\nMy parsing made it look like there's \"in\" before \"vol\", but checking again, the full word is actually \"i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t\", which with my guesses would be \"involvement\". The sentence I'm interpreting is:\n\n\"🐵. s. involvement in the wa🐶 comes to an end.\"\n\nSo, 🐵 would likely be 'u' as in \"U.S. involvement in the war comes to an end.\"\n\nThis reinforces my guesses for this round.\n\nActually, let me verify one more time what the encoded sentence is. Looking at the original text:\n\nEncoded Sentence: 🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\n\nNow let me substitute the already known emoji values and my new guesses:\n\n🐵(u). s. involvement in the wa🐶(r) comes to an end.\n\nThis would give: \"U.S. involvement in the war comes to an end.\"\n\nThis makes sense contextually, so I'm confident in my guesses for this round.\n\nMy guesses for the second attempt are:\n- 👽 = n (already confirmed)\n- 🦆 = v (already confirmed)\n- 🤭 = o (already confirmed)\n- 🦁 = h (already confirmed)\n- 🐨 = m (already confirmed)\n- 🤖 = a (already confirmed)\n- 🐶 = r (new guess)\n- 🐻 = d (already confirmed)\n- 🐵 = u (new guess)Looking at the encoded sentence with the known letters from the first guess:\n\nEncoded Sentence: 🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\n\nWith known letters substituted:\n🐵. s. involvement in the w🤖🐶 comes to an end.\n\nBased on the feedback from the first attempt, I know:\n- 👽=n (True)\n- 🦆=v (True)\n- 🤭=o (True)\n- 🦁=h (True)\n- 🐨=m (True)\n- 🤖=a (True)\n- 🐶 is NOT y (False)\n- 🐻=d (True)\n- 🐵 is NOT p (False)\n\nAnalyzing the remaining unknowns:\n1. For 🐶 in \"wa🐶\" - the most likely word is \"war\", so 🐶 is probably \"r\"\n2. For 🐵 at the beginning of the sentence - given the structure \"🐵. s.\", this looks like initials, possibly \"U.S.\" which makes sense in context of war involvement\n\nLooking at the complete sentence with my new guesses:\n\"U.S. involvement in the war comes to an end.\"\n\nThis sentence is coherent and logical, reinforcing my confidence in these guesses.\n\nAnswer: 👽=n,🦆=v,🤭=o,🦁=h,🐨=m,🤖=a,🐶=r,🐻=d,🐵=u"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Let me look for common patterns and word structures.\n\nThe first word ends with \"🐮🥳🥴r\", which could be \"ther\" or similar.\n\nLet's work with some common English patterns:\n- \"the\" is a very common word. In this text, we see \"🐮🥳🥴\" which could be \"the\".\n- If 🐮🥳🥴 = \"the\", then 🐮 = t, 🥳 = h\n\nLet me see if that makes sense elsewhere:\n- \"🐮🥳r🐨ug🥳\" would be \"through\" if 🐮 = t, 🥳 = h, and 🐨 = o\n- \"🐱🥺🐨u🐮\" would be \"about\" if 🐱 = a, 🥺 = b, 🐨 = o, and 🐮 = t\n\nThis seems consistent. Let's continue:\n- If 🐱 = a, then \"g🐱🐯🐱xi🥴s\" would be \"galaxies\" if 🐯 = l and xi is represented by the following emojis\n\nLet's analyze more words:\n- \"🐭🐨ns🐮🥴🐯🐯🐱🐮i🐨n\" could be \"constellation\" if 🐭 = c, 🐨 = o, 🐮 = t, 🥴 = e, 🐯 = l, 🐱 = a, i = i, 🐨 = o, n = n\n- \"🐭🐨n🐮🐱ins\" could be \"contains\" if these mappings are correct\n\nSo my guesses so far:\n- 🐱 = a\n- 🐯 = l\n- 🐮 = t\n- 🐨 = o\n- 🥴 = e (given)\n- 🥳 = h\n- 🐭 = c\n- 🥺 = b\n- 🤩 = v (maybe, from \"observable\"?)\n- 🦆 = m (maybe, from \"amateur\"?)\n\nLet me double-check the full sentence with these substitutions:\n\nWith these substitutions, the sentence could be:\n\"altogethe_, the constellation contains about 50 galaxies obse_vable th_ough amateu_ telescope.\"\n\nThis seems to make sense! The word \"altogether\" would require 🐯 = r, but I had already assigned 🐯 = l. Let me reconsider.\n\nActually, I think the word might be \"together\" not \"altogether\".\n\nSo the first word could be \"together\", and if 🐯 = g, then:\n- \"g🐱🐯🐱xi🥴s\" would be \"galaxies\" \n- \"🐭🐨ns🐮🥴🐯🐯🐱🐮i🐨n\" would be \"constellation\"\n\nLet me recheck my mapping:\n- 🐱 = a\n- 🐯 = g\n- 🐮 = t\n- 🐨 = o\n- 🥴 = e (given)\n- 🥳 = h\n- 🐭 = c\n- 🥺 = b\n- 🤩 = v (maybe, from \"observable\"?)\n- 🦆 = m (maybe, from \"amateur\"?)\n\nWith these substitutions:\n\"atogetheg, the constellation contains about 50 gagaxies obsegvable thgough amateug tegeschope.\"\n\nSomething's still not right. Let me revise.\n\nActually, the word \"together\" might not be right because of the 'g' in the middle. Let me take another look at the first word: 🐱🐯🐮🐨g🥴🐮🥳🥴r\n\nIf 🐱 = a, 🐯 = l, 🐮 = t, 🐨 = o, 🥴 = e, and 🥳 = h, the first word would be \"altogether\".\n\nLet me test this mapping on the entire sentence:\n\"altogether, the constellation contains about 50 galaxies observable through amateur telescope.\"\n\nThis makes a lot more sense! So my revised mapping is:\n- 🐱 = a\n- 🐯 = l\n- 🐮 = t\n- 🐨 = o\n- 🥴 = e (given)\n- 🥳 = h\n- 🐭 = c\n- 🥺 = b\n- 🤩 = v\n- 🦆 = m\n\nLet me check the full sentence again:\n\"alto_ether, the co_stellatio_ co_tai_s about 50 _alaxies observable throu_h amateur telescope.\"\n\nThere are some emojis I haven't mapped yet, which explains the gaps. Let me fill in more:\n\n\"s\" appears in \"constellation\", \"contains\", \"galaxies\", \"observable\", and \"telescope\". It could be represented by an emoji that appears in all these words.\n\nLet me try to identify more mappings by analyzing specific words:\n\nFor \"constellation\" (🐭🐨ns🐮🥴🐯🐯🐱🐮i🐨n), we have c(🐭), o(🐨), t(🐮), e(🥴), l(🐯), a(🐱), o(🐨). We still need to identify the emojis for n, s, and i.\n\nFor \"galaxies\" (g🐱🐯🐱xi🥴s), we have g, a(🐱), l(🐯), a(🐱), x, i, e(🥴), s. We need to identify the emojis for g, x, i, and s.\n\nMaybe I've misidentified some emojis. Let me try again, focusing on the first word: 🐱🐯🐮🐨g🥴🐮🥳🥴r\n\nThe first word might actually be \"altogether\", with the following mapping:\n- 🐱 = a\n- 🐯 = l\n- 🐮 = t\n- 🐨 = o\n- g = g (literal)\n- 🥴 = e\n- 🐮 = t\n- 🥳 = h\n- 🥴 = e\n- r = r (literal)\n\nThen, the full sentence would be:\n\"altogether, the constellation contains about 50 galaxies observable through amateur telescope.\"\n\nYes, this makes sense. The sentence includes some literal letters (g, r) and some encoded as emojis. With this understanding, I'll revise my mappings:\n\n- 🐱 = a\n- 🐯 = l\n- 🐮 = t\n- 🐨 = o\n- 🥴 = e (given)\n- 🥳 = h\n- 🐭 = c\n- 🥺 = b\n- 🤩 = v\n- 🦆 = m\n\nAnd letters g, r, i, n, s, u, x appear as themselves.\n\nLet me verify this by going through the sentence word by word:\n\n\"🐱🐯🐮🐨g🥴🐮🥳🥴r\" = \"altogether\"\n\"🐮🥳🥴\" = \"the\"\n\"🐭🐨ns🐮🥴🐯🐯🐱🐮i🐨n\" = \"constellation\"\n\"🐭🐨n🐮🐱ins\" = \"contains\"\n\"🐱🥺🐨u🐮\" = \"about\"\n\"50\" = \"50\"\n\"g🐱🐯🐱xi🥴s\" = \"galaxies\"\n\"🐨🥺s🥴r🤩🐱🥺🐯🥴\" = \"observable\"\n\"🐮🥳r🐨ug🥳\" = \"through\"\n\"🐱🦆🐱🐮🥴ur\" = \"amateur\"\n\"🐮🥴🐯🥴s🐭🐨p🥴\" = \"telescope\"\n\nLet's check if these mappings are consistent. The sentence would be:\n\"altogether, the constellation contains about 50 galaxies observable through amateur telescope.\"\n\nThis is a coherent sentence about astronomy, which makes it very likely that our mappings are correct.\n\nFinal answer:\n🐱=a, 🐯=l, 🐮=t, 🐨=o, 🥴=e, 🥳=h, 🐭=c, 🥺=b, 🤩=v, 🦆=m, p=p, s=s, r=r, g=g, i=i, u=u, x=x, n=nLooking at this encoded sentence, I need to figure out what each emoji represents. \n\nI'll start with the hint that 🥴=e, which is the most common letter in English.\n\nAfter analyzing patterns and word structures, I notice that the sentence appears to be about astronomy. Let me work through it methodically:\n\nThe word \"🐮🥳🥴\" likely represents \"the\" (a very common word), which means:\n- 🐮 = t\n- 🥳 = h\n\nLooking at words like \"🐭🐨ns🐮🥴🐯🐯🐱🐮i🐨n\" and \"g🐱🐯🐱xi🥴s\", I can deduce:\n- 🐱 = a\n- 🐯 = l\n- 🐨 = o\n- 🐭 = c\n\nFor the word \"🐱🥺🐨u🐮\", which is likely \"about\":\n- 🥺 = b\n\nLooking at \"🐨🥺s🥴r🤩🐱🥺🐯🥴\", which appears to be \"observable\":\n- 🤩 = v\n\nAnd finally, from \"🐱🦆🐱🐮🥴ur\" which seems to be \"amateur\":\n- 🦆 = m\n\nWith these substitutions, the sentence becomes:\n\"altogether, the constellation contains about 50 galaxies observable through amateur telescope.\"\n\nThis makes perfect sense as an astronomical statement.\n\nAnswer: 🐱=a,🐯=l,🐮=t,🐨=o,🥴=e,🥳=h,🐭=c,🥺=b,🤩=v,🦆=m"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Now let's identify more common patterns:\n- 🙄😱 looks like \"of\" which would mean 🙄 = 'o'\n- 😇 appears in various contexts, could be 'a'\n- 🥺n would then be \"in\", confirming 🥺 = 'i'\n\nLet's update:\n```\nin the 😱all o😱 2006, 🤭a🐭e🐮gno and 🐻igna🐰🤭o 🤩e🐮e in🤭o🐮🥳o🐮ated into the 🐦🧐ni🤭i🥳alit🐼, de🐰🥳ite an atte🐦🥳t 🐻🐼 🐻igna🐰🤭o to 🐮e🐰i🐰t the in🤭o🐮🥳o🐮ation in the 🤭o🧐nt🐰.\n```\n\nThis is starting to make more sense. Let's continue:\n- \"😱all o😱 2006\" looks like \"fall of 2006\", so 😱 = 'f'\n- \"de🐰🥳ite\" might be \"despite\", so 🐰 = 'r' and 🥳 = 'p'\n- \"atte🐦🥳t\" would be \"attempt\", confirming 🐦 = 'm' and 🥳 = 'p'\n\nLet's update again:\n```\nin the fall of 2006, 🤭a🐭ergno and 🐻ignar🤭o 🤩ere in🤭orperated into the m🧐ni🤭ipalit🐼, despite an attempt 🐻🐼 🐻ignar🤭o to reri🐰t the in🤭orporation in the 🤭o🧐ntr.\n```\n\nGetting closer. Let's identify more:\n- \"🤭a🐭ergno\" and \"🐻ignar🤭o\" seem to be proper nouns. \n- \"in🤭orporated\" suggests 🤭 = 'c'\n- \"🐻ignar🤭o\" might be \"Signario\", suggesting 🐻 = 's'\n- \"m🧐nicipality\" suggests 🧐 = 'u'\n- \"country\" suggests 🐼 = 'y'\n\nLet's update:\n```\nin the fall of 2006, ca🐭ergno and signarco 🤩ere incorporated into the municipality, despite an attempt 🐻y signarco to reri🐰t the incorporation in the country.\n```\n\nFurther refining:\n- \"ca🐭ergno\" might be \"Catergno\" or similar, suggesting 🐭 = 't'\n- But we already have 't' as 👻. Let's revisit this.\n- \"signarco\" seems off. Let's recheck.\n\nRevisiting, the noun pattern \"🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄\" translates to \"signarco\" with our current mappings. This seems strange. Let's reconsider.\n\nLooking at \"🤩e🐮e\", it's likely \"were\", suggesting 🤩 = 'w' and 🐮 = 'r'.\n\nUpdating:\n```\nin the fall of 2006, catergno and signarco were incorporated into the municipality, despite an attempt by signarco to resist the incorporation in the country.\n```\n\nOk this is making more sense now. Let's revisit \"catergno\" and \"signarco\". These might be proper names specific to the context.\n\n\"🐭\" could be 't', but we already have 't' as 👻. This is a bit puzzling. \n\nActually, let's revisit our approach. We have 👻 = 't', so let's focus on filling in other emojis first:\n\n🥺 = 'i'\n🥶 = 'h'\n😂 = 'e'\n🙄 = 'o'\n😱 = 'f'\n😇 = 'a'\n🐰 = 'r'\n🥳 = 'p'\n🐦 = 'm'\n🧐 = 'u'\n🐼 = 'y'\n🤭 = 'c'\n🐻 = 's'\n🤩 = 'w'\n🐮 = 'r'\n\nWait, we have a duplicate here 🐰 and 🐮 both mapped to 'r'. Let's re-check.\n\nI think I might have made a mistake. Let's break it down differently.\n\nBased on \"t🥶😂\", I'm assuming it's \"the\", which means 🥶 = 'h' and 😂 = 'e'. \"🥺n\" would be \"in\" or \"on\", and based on the context, 🥺 = 'i' makes more sense.\n\nWith these basics, let's revisit the sentence:\n```\nin the fall of 2006, ca🐭ergno and 🐻ignario were incorporated into the municipality, de🐰pite an attempt by 🐻ignario to reri🐰t the incorporation in the country.\n```\n\nThis doesn't fully make sense yet. The proper names are still unclear. Let's rethink.\n\nWait, I realized I made an error. \"were\" should be \"🤩ere\". Let's double check this and confirm if 🤩 = 'w'.\n\nFrom the encoded text, we have \"🤩😂🐮😂\". If we assume 😂 = 'e' and 🐮 = 'r', this would be \"w🐮e\", which doesn't make sense for \"were\". Let's reinterpret.\n\nIf 🤩 = 'w', 😂 = 'e', and 🐮 = 'r', then \"🤩😂🐮😂\" would be \"were\", which makes sense!\n\nSo, 🐮 = 'r' seems right. Now, let's refocus.\n\nReconsidering \"ca🐭ergno\", if this is a proper name, it's hard to deduce 🐭 directly. Similarly, \"🐻ignario\" could be a proper name, and without more context, it's hard to determine 🐻 precisely.\n\nLet's look at common words and patterns:\n- \"de🐰pite\" should be \"despite\", so 🐰 = 's'. But wait, I earlier thought 🐻 = 's'. Let me double check.\n- \"in🤭o🐰po🐰ated\" should be \"incorporated\", which gives us 🐰 = 'r'. This confirms 🐮 and 🐰 are both 'r'.\n\nLet's revise:\n🥺 = 'i'\n🥶 = 'h'\n😂 = 'e'\n🙄 = 'o'\n😱 = 'f'\n😇 = 'a'\n🐰 = 'r'\n🥳 = 'p'\n🐦 = 'm'\n🧐 = 'u'\n🐼 = 'y'\n🤭 = 'c'\n🤩 = 'w'\n🐮 = 'r'\n\n\"🐻\" is likely for a letter I've not identified yet.\n\nLet's try to interpret \"🐻ignario\". In \"de🐰pite an attempt 🐻🐼 🐻ignario\", the phrase \"🐻🐼\" should be \"by\". So 🐻 = 'b'. \n\nNow, does \"bignario\" make sense as a proper name? Hmm, it's still unclear. \n\nLet's check \"ca🐭ergno\". Now, if 🐭 = 't', then we'd have \"catergno\". But we already have 👻 = 't'. So, 🐭 must be something else. Given it's for a proper name, it's hard to guess exactly.\n\nLet's look at \"m🧐nicipality\". If 🧐 = 'u', this spells \"municipality\", which seems right.\n\nIn the phrase \"to re🐰ist the incorporation\", \"re🐰ist\" should be \"resist\", which contradicts 🐰 = 'r'. Let me double check.\n\nWait let me double check the encoded text again for \"resist\". the original was \"👻🙄 🐮😂🐰🥺🐰👻 👻🥶😂\". With 👻 = 't', 🙄 = 'o', 🐮 = 'r', 😂 = 'e', 🥺 = 'i', 🐰 should be 's', and 🥶 = 'h', this spells \"to resist the\".\n\nSo, 🐰 should be 's', not 'r'. This is a correction.\n\nLet's revise:\n🥺 = 'i'\n🥶 = 'h'\n😂 = 'e'\n🙄 = 'o'\n😱 = 'f'\n😇 = 'a'\n🐰 = 's'\n🥳 = 'p'\n🐦 = 'm'\n🧐 = 'u'\n🐼 = 'y'\n🤭 = 'c'\n🤩 = 'w'\n🐮 = 'r'\n🐻 = 'b'\n\nnow \"bignario\" is starting to look suspicious, as does \"cabergno\". These names might be fictional, or specific to the context, or I might have misidentified some emoji.\n\nLet's see if \"🐮e🐰i🐰t\" is \"resist\" but that would mean 🐰 = 's', which I just confirmed.\n\nBut wait, the phrase was \"to 🐮e🐰i🐰t\", not \"to re🐰ist\". I might have misread.\n\nLet me carefully trace the original. It says \"👻🙄 🐮😂🐰🥺🐰👻 👻🥶😂\". Knowing 👻 = 't', 🙄 = 'o', 🐮 = 'r', 😂 = 'e', 🥺 = 'i', 🐰 = 's', 🥶 = 'h', this would be \"to resist the\". That's correct!\n\nSo, 🐮 = 'r' and 🐰 = 's' are both correct.\n\nLet's revisit \"🐻ignario\". With 🐻 = 'b', this would be \"bignario\". Hmm, this doesn't seem like a common name. Maybe it's \"signario\", which would mean 🐻 = 's'. But that would conflict with 🐰 = 's'.\n\nBut in the phrase \"de🐰pite\", 🐰 should be 's', not 'r'. Let's double check.\n\nWhen I trace through the encoded text, I should be careful to distinguish the emojis. This is getting confusing.\n\nLet's revisit the encoded text for clarity:\n🥺n 👻🥶😂 😱😇🐱🐱 🙄😱 2006, 🤭😇🐭😂🐮gn🙄 😇nd 🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄 🤩😂🐮😂 🥺n🤭🙄🐮🥳🙄🐮😇👻😂d 🥺n👻🙄 👻🥶😂 🐦🧐n🥺🤭🥺🥳😇🐱🥺👻🐼, d😂🐰🥳🥺👻😂 😇n 😇👻👻😂🐦🥳👻 🐻🐼 🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄 👻🙄 🐮😂🐰🥺🐰👻 👻🥶😂 🥺n🤭🙄🐮🥳🙄🐮😇👻🥺🙄n 🥺n 👻🥶😂 🤭🙄🧐🐮👻🐰.\n\nReplace what I'm confident about:\n🥺 = 'i'\n🥶 = 'h'\n😂 = 'e'\n🙄 = 'o'\n👻 = 't'\n😱 = 'f'\n😇 = 'a'\n🥳 = 'p'\n🐦 = 'm'\n🧐 = 'u'\n🐼 = 'y'\n🤭 = 'c'\n🤩 = 'w'\n\nThis gives:\nin the fall of 2006, ca🐭ergno and 🐻igna🐰co were incorporated into the municipality, de🐰pite an attempt 🐻y 🐻igna🐰co to 🐮e🐰i🐰t the incorporation in the count🐰y.\n\nThere's a specific phrase I'm getting confused about.\n\n\"d😂🐰🥳🥺👻😂\" with the substitutions would be \"de🐰pite\". For this to be \"despite\", 🐰 = 's'.\n\nBut in \"🐮😂🐰🥺🐰👻\" with the substitutions, this would be \"🐮e🐰i🐰t\". For this to be \"resist\", 🐮 = 'r' and 🐰 = 's', which seems contradictory.\n\nWait, I think I misread before. Let's carefully trace this.\n\n\"👻🙄 🐮😂🐰🥺🐰👻 👻🥶😂\" with known values becomes \"to 🐮esi🐰t the\". For this to be \"to resist the\", 🐮 = 'r' and 🐰 = 's'.\n\nBut then, \"d😂🐰🥳🥺👻😂\" would become \"de🐰pite\". For this to be \"despite\", 🐰 should also be 's'.\n\nThis is consistent! So, 🐮 = 'r' and 🐰 = 's'.\n\nNow, \"🐻igna🐰co\" would be \"🐻ignasco\". If 🐻 = 'b', this would be \"bignasco\", which is a place in Switzerland. That could be right. Or if 🐻 = 'd', this would be \"dignasco\", which might also be a place or name.\n\nIn the phrase \"attempt 🐻y\", 🐻 is likely 'b' (for \"by\").\n\nLet's update:\n🥺 = 'i'\n🥶 = 'h'\n😂 = 'e'\n🙄 = 'o'\n👻 = 't'\n😱 = 'f'\n😇 = 'a'\n🥳 = 'p'\n🐦 = 'm'\n🧐 = 'u'\n🐼 = 'y'\n🤭 = 'c'\n🤩 = 'w'\n🐮 = 'r'\n🐰 = 's'\n🐻 = 'b'\n\nThis gives:\nin the fall of 2006, ca🐭ergno and bignasco were incorporated into the municipality, despite an attempt by bignasco to resist the incorporation in the country.\n\nNow, for \"ca🐭ergno\". If 🐭 = 'v', this would be \"cavergno\", which is also a place in Switzerland. That might be right!\n\nLet's try that:\n🥺 = 'i'\n🥶 = 'h'\n😂 = 'e'\n🙄 = 'o'\n👻 = 't'\n😱 = 'f'\n😇 = 'a'\n🥳 = 'p'\n🐦 = 'm'\n🧐 = 'u'\n🐼 = 'y'\n🤭 = 'c'\n🤩 = 'w'\n🐮 = 'r'\n🐰 = 's'\n🐻 = 'b'\n🐭 = 'v'\n\nThis gives:\nin the fall of 2006, cavergno and bignasco were incorporated into the municipality, despite an attempt by bignasco to resist the incorporation in the country.\n\nThis seems to make perfect sense! Now we're just missing a few minor emojis:\n- 🐱 in \"😱😇🐱🐱\" (fall)\n- 🐱 in \"🐦🧐n🥺🤭🥺🥳😇🐱🥺👻🐼\" (municipality)\n- 🐴 (I think I might have missed this one somewhere)\n\nIn \"😱😇🐱🐱\", if 😱 = 'f' and 😇 = 'a', then 🐱 = 'l'. This would make it \"fall\", which seems right.\n\nLet's check \"🐦🧐n🥺🤭🥺🥳😇🐱🥺👻🐼\" with our values:\n🐦 = 'm', 🧐 = 'u', 🥺 = 'i', 🤭 = 'c', 🥳 = 'p', 😇 = 'a', 🐱 = 'l', 👻 = 't', 🐼 = 'y'.\nThis would be \"municipality\", which confirms 🐱 = 'l'.\n\nLet's revise:\n🥺 = 'i'\n🥶 = 'h'\n😂 = 'e'\n🙄 = 'o'\n👻 = 't'\n😱 = 'f'\n😇 = 'a'\n🥳 = 'p'\n🐦 = 'm'\n🧐 = 'u'\n🐼 = 'y'\n🤭 = 'c'\n🤩 = 'w'\n🐮 = 'r'\n🐰 = 's'\n🐻 = 'b'\n🐭 = 'v'\n🐱 = 'l'\n\nLooking at the rest of the encoded text, I don't think I've missed any more emojis. Let's replace everything we know:\n\nin the fall of 2006, cavergno and bignasco were incorporated into the municipality, despite an attempt by bignasco to resist the incorporation in the country.\n\nThis sentence now makes complete sense.\n\nI've been a bit confusing with my approach, but I think we've found the correct mapping. Let's make sure we have covered all the original emojis:\n\nEmojis in the encoded text:\n🥺 = 'i'\n🥶 = 'h'\n😂 = 'e'\n🙄 = 'o'\n👻 = 't'\n😱 = 'f'\n😇 = 'a'\n🥳 = 'p'\n🐦 = 'm'\n🧐 = 'u'\n🐼 = 'y'\n🤭 = 'c'\n🤩 = 'w'\n🐮 = 'r'\n🐰 = 's'\n🐻 = 'b'\n🐭 = 'v'\n🐱 = 'l'\n\nI think that's all of them!\n\nOkay, let me confirm the original encoded sentence one more time and see if there's any emoji I've missed:\n\n🥺n 👻🥶😂 😱😇🐱🐱 🙄😱 2006, 🤭😇🐭😂🐮gn🙄 😇nd 🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄 🤩😂🐮😂 🥺n🤭🙄🐮🥳🙄🐮😇👻😂d 🥺n👻🙄 👻🥶😂 🐦🧐n🥺🤭🥺🥳😇🐱🥺👻🐼, d😂🐰🥳🥺👻😂 😇n 😇👻👻😂🐦🥳👻 🐻🐼 🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄 👻🙄 🐮😂🐰🥺🐰👻 👻🥶😂 🥺n🤭🙄🐮🥳🙄🐮😇👻🥺🙄n 🥺n 👻🥶😂 🤭🙄🧐🐮👻🐰.\n\nWait, I just realized there's \"cavergno\" and \"bignasco\" which are both missing the 'g' and 'n'. Let me check for these.\n\nIn \"🤭😇🐭😂🐮gn🙄\", the 'g' and 'n' are not represented by emojis. This is a bit confusing.\n\nOh, I see.

So the sentence makes perfect sense with my mappings.\n\nMy final guess for this round is:\n🤗 = a (given)\n🤠 = m\n🥳 = n\n😂 = u\n🐻 = i\n🦆 = x\n\nActually, I'm still unsure about 😂. Let me check both spellings:\n- If 😂 = 'o', then the name is \"osborne\", which matches Sharon Osborne.\n- If 😂 = 'u', then the name is \"osbourne\", which doesn't match Sharon Osborne's spelling.\n\nActually, it seems like the more common spelling of the last name is \"Osbourne\" (with a 'u'), like Ozzy Osbourne. So I'll go with 😂 = 'o'.\n\nSo, my revised guess is:\n🤗 = a (given)\n🤠 = m\n🥳 = n\n😂 = o\n🐻 = i\n🦆 = x\n\nThis gives the sentence:\n\"osborne later became a judge on the talent shows the x factor and america's got talent.\"\n\nActually, I think the reason for my confusion is that Sharon's last name is spelled \"Osbourne\" with a 'u', not \"Osborne\". So, indeed, 😂 = 'u' and the sentence is:\n\"osbourne later became a judge on the talent shows the x factor and america's got talent.\"\n\nThis makes sense, referencing Sharon Osbourne who was a judge on both \"The X Factor\" and \"America's Got Talent\".\n\nFinal guess:\n🤗 = a (given)\n🤠 = m\n🥳 = n\n😂 = u\n🐻 = i\n🦆 = x# Crypto Word Game Analysis\n\nLooking at the encoded sentence:\n```\nosbo😂r🥳e l🤗ter bec🤗🤠e 🤗 j😂dge o🥳 the t🤗le🥳t shows the 🦆 f🤗ctor 🤗🥳d 🤗🤠er🐻c🤗's got t🤗le🥳t.\n```\n\nWith the hint that 🤗 = a, I'll work on decoding the rest of the emojis.\n\nFirst, let me replace all instances of 🤗 with 'a':\n```\nosbo😂r🥳e later beca🤠e a j😂dge o🥳 the tale🥳t shows the 🦆 factor a🥳d a🤠er🐻ca's got tale🥳t.\n```\n\nLooking at common English patterns and the context, I can make these deductions:\n\n1.

Looking at words with 'e' (💩):\n   - t🐭💩 appears twice - this could be \"the\"\n   - t💩🐰🤑 - a word like \"term\"\n   - 🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮 - a longer word ending with \"es\"\n\n2. Common word patterns:\n   - 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt appears and 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nc🥵 appears - these look like related words\n   - If 😂 = 'a', then we'd have \"accountant\" and \"accountancy\"\n\nLet me make some educated guesses:\n- 💩 = e (given)\n- 🐭 = h (making t🐭💩 = \"the\")\n- 🐰 = r (common letter)\n- 🐶 = o (common letter)\n- 🤑 = m (if t💩🐰🤑 = \"term\")\n- 😂 = a (based on \"accountant\" pattern)\n- 🧐 = u (based on \"accountant\" pattern)\n- 🤮 = s (making the long word possibly \"services\")\n- 🙄 = v (based on \"services\")\n- 🤥 = i (based on \"services\")\n- 🥵 = y (making \"accountancy\")\n- 🐵 = f (guessing)\n- 🤗 = h or w (not sure)\n\nLet me try to decode the sentence with these guesses:\n\"from the [word] accountant the term accountancy of services.\"\n\nThis doesn't fully make sense yet, but I might need to adjust some guesses.\n\nWait, if t is already appearing unencoded, then t🐭💩 wouldn't be \"the\" because 't' is already 't'. Let me rethink...\n\nActually, I notice that \"t\", \"c\", and \"n\" appear without emojis. This makes me think that the sentence might use a mix of unencoded letters and emoji-encoded letters.\n\nLet me try a different approach. I'll assume all letters without emojis are already correctly represented:\n\nEncoded Sentence: f🐰🐶🤑 t🐭💩 🤗🐶🐰🤮 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt t🐭💩 t💩🐰🤑 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nc🥵 🙄🐵 🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮.\n\nGiven 💩 = e, I can partially decode this as:\nf___ t_e ____ _cc__nt_nt t_e te__ _cc__nt_nc_ __ _e___e_.\n\nGiven the context, this looks like it might be a sentence about accounting. The word \"😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt\" could be \"accountant\" and \"😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nc🥵\" could be \"accountancy\".\n\nLet's try these substitutions:\n- 😂 = a\n- 🐶 = o\n- 🧐 = u\n- 🥵 = y\n\nWith these, we'd have:\nf___ t_e ____ accountant t_e te__ accountancy __ _e___e_.\n\nNow, \"t🐭💩\" appears twice.

A common word fitting this pattern would be \"services\".\n- 🤮 = s\n- 🙄 = v\n- 🤥 = i\n\n\"🤗🐶🐰🤮\" would be \"_or_\", possibly \"word\" or \"form\".\n- 🤗 = w or f\n\n\"🙄🐵\" would be \"v_\", possibly \"of\".\n- 🐵 = f\n\nLet's try to decode the entire sentence with these guesses:\nf🐰🐶🤑 t🐭💩 🤗🐶🐰🤮 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt t🐭💩 t💩🐰🤑 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nc🥵 🙄🐵 🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮.\n\nWith the substitutions:\n- 💩 = e\n- 🐰 = r\n- 🐶 = o\n- 🤑 = m\n- 🐭 = h\n- 😂 = a\n- 🧐 = u\n- 🤮 = s\n- 🙄 = v\n- 🤥 = i\n- 🥵 = y\n- 🐵 = f\n- 🤗 = w (guessing)\n\nThis would give:\nfrom the wors accountant the term accountancy of services.\n\nWait, \"wors\" doesn't make sense.

If 🐶 = o and 🐰 = r, then 🤗🐶🐰🤮 would be \"_or_\". Some possibilities are: work, word, form, lord, pork, fork, dork, etc.\n\nGiven the context of the sentence about accounting, \"word\" seems most plausible. So:\n- 🤗 = w\n\nLet's check the sentence once more:\nfrom the word accountant the term accountancy of services.\n\nThis makes sense!

Similarly, \"t\", \"c\", and \"n\" are not encoded.\n\nSo my answer is:\n💩=e, 🐰=r, 🐶=o, 🤑=m, 🐭=h, 😂=a, 🧐=u, 🤮=s, 🙄=v, 🤥=i, 🥵=y, 🐵=f, 🤗=w# Analysis of Encoded Sentence\n\nLet me break down the encoded sentence:\n`f🐰🐶🤑 t🐭💩 🤗🐶🐰🤮 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt t🐭💩 t💩🐰🤑 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nc🥵 🙄🐵 🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮.`\n\nFirst, I notice something interesting - some letters (t, c, n) appear unencoded in the sentence, while others are represented by emojis.\n\nI'm given the hint that 💩=e.\n\nLooking at word patterns:\n- t🐭💩 appears twice - likely \"the\"\n- 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt and 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nc🥵 look like \"accountant\" and \"accountancy\"\n- The last word 🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮 has two 💩 (e), likely \"services\"\n\nBased on common English words and context, I'll make these deductions:\n- 🐰 represents \"r\" (common letter, fits in multiple positions)\n- 🐶 likely represents \"o\" (fits in \"accountant\")\n- 🐭 is probably \"h\" (makes \"the\")\n- 😂 would be \"a\" (fits \"accountant\")\n- 🧐 is \"u\" (in \"accountant\")\n- 🤑 seems to be \"m\" (forms \"from\" and \"term\")\n- 🤮 represents \"s\" (at beginning and end of \"services\")\n- 🙄 is \"v\" (in \"services\")\n- 🤥 is \"i\" (in \"services\")\n- 🥵 is \"y\" (completing \"accountancy\")\n- 🐵 is \"f\" (makes \"of\")\n- 🤗 is \"w\" (makes \"word\")\n\nWith these substitutions, the decoded sentence reads:\n\"from the word accountant the term accountancy of services.\"\n\nThis makes complete sense in the context of accounting terminology.\n\nAnswer: 💩=e,🐰=r,🐶=o,🤑=m,🐭=h,😂=a,🧐=u,🤮=s,🙄=v,🤥=i,🥵=y,🐵=f,🤗=w","HTTPError 529: {\"error\":{\"message\":\"-4316: Overloaded\",\"code\":\"-4307\"}}","Let's analyze the encoded sentence and the feedback from the previous guess to make my next guess.\n\nThe encoded sentence is:\nf🐰🐶🤑 t🐭💩 🤗🐶🐰🤮 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt t🐭💩 t💩🐰🤑 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nc🥵 🙄🐵 🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮.\n\nHint: 💩=e\n\nFrom the previous guess and the feedback, I know that the following emoji-to-letter mappings are correct:\n- 💩=e (given as a hint, and confirmed true)\n- 🐰=r (confirmed true)\n- 🐶=o (confirmed true)\n- 🤑=m (confirmed true)\n- 🐭=h (confirmed true)\n- 😂=a (confirmed true)\n- 🧐=u (confirmed true)\n- 🥵=y (confirmed true)\n- 🤗=w (confirmed true)\n\nAnd the following mappings are incorrect:\n- 🤮 was guessed as 's', which is wrong\n- 🙄 was guessed as 'v', which is wrong\n- 🤥 was guessed as 'i', which is wrong\n- 🐵 was guessed as 'f', which is wrong\n\nNow let's start replacing the emojis with the correct letters to see what the encoded sentence looks like:\n\nf🐰🐶🤑 t🐭💩 🤗🐶🐰🤮 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt t🐭💩 t💩🐰🤑 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nc🥵 🙄🐵 🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮.\n\nReplacing with the correct letters:\nfrom the wor_ accountant the term accountancy _ _er___e_.\n\nWe still need to figure out the values for the remaining emojis: 🤮, 🙄, 🤥, and 🐵. And there's also a letter 'f' at the beginning.\n\nLet's think about what words might fit in the partially decoded sentence.\n\n\"from the wor_ accountant the term accountancy _ _er___e_.\"\n\nThe first word could be \"from,\" which means the letter 'f' in the encoded sentence is indeed 'f'.\n\nFor \"wor_\", it could be \"word\", \"work\", \"world\", etc. Let's go with \"word\" since it seems most likely when discussing terminology. That would mean 🤮 = d.\n\nFor the last part \"_ _er___e_\", it might be \"of services\" or something similar. If 🙄 is 'o', then we have \"o_ _er___e_\". If 🐵 is 'f', then it's \"of _er___e_\". If 🤥 is 'c' or 's', then \"of _ervice_\" could make sense. Since 🤥 was guessed as 'i' and was wrong, and I think it's likely 'c', I'll try that. Then if 🤮 is correct as 'd', the last part would be \"of service_\".\n\nLet's make a new guess:\n- 💩=e (given)\n- 🐰=r (confirmed)\n- 🐶=o (confirmed)\n- 🤑=m (confirmed)\n- 🐭=h (confirmed)\n- 😂=a (confirmed)\n- 🧐=u (confirmed)\n- 🥵=y (confirmed)\n- 🤗=w (confirmed)\n- 🤮=d (new guess)\n- 🙄=o (new guess) - wait, 🐶 is already 'o'. That can't be right. Maybe 🙄 is 'p'? Let's try that.\n- 🤥=c (new guess)\n- 🐵=f (new guess) - wait, the first letter in the sentence is already 'f'. Maybe 🐵 is 'l'? Let's try that.\n\nHmm, wait a second, I'm making some errors. Let me more carefully build up the sentence using the confirmed letters.\n\nf🐰🐶🤑 t🐭💩 🤗🐶🐰🤮 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt t🐭💩 t💩🐰🤑 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nc🥵 🙄🐵 🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮.\n\nReplacing with confirmed letters:\nfrom the wor_ accountant the term accountancy _ _er___e_.\n\nActually, wait, I might have messed up when constructing the sentence with the substitutions.

This is likely \"from the word\". If 🤮 = d, then the phrase is \"from the word\".\n\nNext, we have \"accountant\", which is fully decoded.\n\nThen \"the term accountancy\", which is also fully decoded.\n\nFinally, we have \"_ _er___e_\", where the underscores represent emojis that we haven't figured out yet:\n- 🙄: Could be an 'o' (but 🐶 is already 'o', so that can't be right), or perhaps 'p' or 's'\n- 🐵: Could be 'f', but the first letter of the sentence is also 'f', so that could be a coincidence or the encoding could allow multiple emojis for the same letter. It could also be another common letter like 's' or 'l'.\n- 🤥: Could be 'c' or another letter.\n- 🤮: We hypothesized 'd'.\n\nActually, wait, let me parse the decoded sentence one more time more carefully.\n\nEncoded: f🐰🐶🤑 t🐭💩 🤗🐶🐰🤮 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt t🐭💩 t💩🐰🤑 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nc🥵 🙄🐵 🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮.\n\nCertain substitutions:\n- 💩=e\n- 🐰=r\n- 🐶=o\n- 🤑=m\n- 🐭=h\n- 😂=a\n- 🧐=u\n- 🥵=y\n- 🤗=w\n\nApplying these substitutions:\nfrom the wor_ accountant the term accountancy _ _er___e_.\n\nIt's starting to look clearer. \"from the word accountant the term accountancy\" makes sense. The last part is probably \"of services\". The feedback said that 🤮 is not 's', 🙄 is not 'v', 🤥 is not 'i', and 🐵 is not 'f'.\n\nLet's try:\n- 🤮 = d (for \"word\")\n- 🙄 = o (but 🐶 is already 'o', so this can't be right. Maybe it's 'p'? But then we'd have \"pf services\", which doesn't make sense. Maybe it's 'n'? \"of services\" would make sense if 🙄 = 'o' and 🐵 = 'f', but both of those have issues. Let's try to think of alternative endings for the sentence.)\n- 🐵 = s (for first letter of \"services\")\n- 🤥 = c (for \"services\")\n\nActually, I'm overthinking this. We don't want to guess all of them at once. Let's just make clear predictions for a few and see the feedback.\n\nFor 🤮, let's go with 'd' (for \"word\"). And for the end of the sentence, \"_ _er___e_\", if it's \"services\", then 🤮 would be 's', but we already know 🤮 is not 's'. It could be \"of services\" or \"is derived\", etc.\n\nLet's try:\n- 🤮 = d (for \"word\")\n- 🙄 = i (for first letter of a word)\n- 🤥 = c (for \"services\" or a similar word)\n- 🐵 = s (for \"services\")\n\nBut, I see a problem: if 🤮 is 'd', then the last word ends with 'd', which wouldn't make sense for \"services\". So let's go with a different hypothesis.\n\nIf the last part is \"of services\", and 🤮 is 'd' (for \"word\"), then \"services\" would be \"_er___e_\". This could be \"services\", so 🤮 is 's', but we know 🤮 is not 's'. Maybe the last word isn't \"services\"... maybe it's a similar term, like \"serviced\" (which would work with 🤮 = 'd') or something else.\n\nActually hold on, I see a potential mistake in my interpretation of the encoded sentence. Let's just list out the entire encoded sentence with the emojis and corresponding guesses, and I'll re-evaluate:\n\nf (f) + 🐰 (r) + 🐶 (o) + 🤑 (m) = from\nt (t) + 🐭 (h) + 💩 (e) = the\n🤗 (w) + 🐶 (o) + 🐰 (r) + 🤮 (unknown) = wor_\n😂 (a) + c (c) + c (c) + 🐶 (o) + 🧐 (u) + n (n) + t (t) + 😂 (a) + n (n) + t (t) = accountant\nt (t) + 🐭 (h) + 💩 (e) = the\nt (t) + 💩 (e) + 🐰 (r) + 🤑 (m) = term\n😂 (a) + c (c) + c (c) + 🐶 (o) + 🧐 (u) + n (n) + t (t) + 😂 (a) + n (n) + c (c) + 🥵 (y) = accountancy\n🙄 (unknown) + 🐵 (unknown) = _\n🤮 (unknown) + 💩 (e) + 🐰 (r) + 🙄 (unknown) + 🤥 (unknown) + 💩 (e) + 🤮 (unknown) = _er___e_\n\nOk, now I see more clearly. \n\n\"from the wor_ accountant the term accountancy _ _er___e_.\"\n\nThe first word is \"from\". The second is \"the\". The third word starts with \"wor\" and is incomplete. \"word\" is a plausible completion, so 🤮 = d.\n\nThe next word is \"accountant\", and after that is \"the\" and then \"term\" and then \"accountancy\".\n\nThen we have a single unknown emoji 🙄, which could represent 'o' (even though 🐶 is already 'o', there could be multiple emojis for the same letter), or it could be 'i' or 's' or 'n' or 'b', etc. Based on the context, my best guess is that it stands for 'o' for \"of\".\n\nThen we have 🐵, which is a single letter emoji. Given the context, it could be 's' for \"services\". So the phrase would be \"of services\".\n\nThen we have an incomplete word \"_er___e_\". If we guess 🤮 = d for \"word\", then this word starts with \"der\" and ends with \"ed\", which doesn't immediately suggest any common English words. If 🐵 = s, then the word would be \"ser___ed\", which could be \"serviced\".\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nIf 🤮 = d and the last word ends with 🤮 = d, then the word has the pattern \"d e r _ _ e d\". Some common English words that fit this pattern:\n- \"derived\"\n- \"derided\"\n\nIf the word is \"derived\", then 🙄 = 'i' and 🤥 = 'v'.\n\nAnd 🐵 would be the first letter of a one-letter word between \"accountancy\" and \"derived\". In this context, it could be \"is\" (so 🐵 = 'i') or \"a\" (so 🐵 = 'a').\n\nSo, the full sentence would be \"from the word accountant the term accountancy is derived.\"\n\nThis makes sense grammatically and semantically.\n\n- 💩=e (given)\n- 🐰=r (confirmed)\n- 🐶=o (confirmed)\n- 🤑=m (confirmed)\n- 🐭=h (confirmed)\n- 😂=a (confirmed)\n- 🧐=u (confirmed)\n- 🥵=y (confirmed)\n- 🤗=w (confirmed)\n- 🤮=d (new guess)\n- 🙄=i (new guess)\n- 🤥=v (new guess)\n- 🐵=s (new guess) - maybe 'i' for \"is\"?\n\nLet me reconsider from the beginning.\n\nEncoded: f🐰🐶🤑 t🐭💩 🤗🐶🐰🤮 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt t🐭💩 t💩🐰🤑 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nc🥵 🙄🐵 🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮.\n\nI know:\n- 💩=e\n- 🐰=r\n- 🐶=o\n- 🤑=m\n- 🐭=h\n- 😂=a\n- 🧐=u\n- 🥵=y\n- 🤗=w\n\nSo the partially decoded sentence is:\nfrom the wor_ accountant the term accountancy _ _er___e_.\n\nLet's check the feedback from the previous guess again. The feedback said that 🤮 is not 's', 🙄 is not 'v', 🤥 is not 'i', and 🐵 is not 'f'.\n\nLooking at the pattern again, \"from the wor_ accountant the term accountancy _ _er___e_.\" The obvious completion for \"wor_\" is \"word\", so 🤮 = d.\n\nFor the last part \"_ _er___e_\", we can try to fill in the emojis:\n🙄 + 🐵 + 🤮 + 💩 + 🐰 + 🙄 + 🤥 + 💩 + 🤮\n\nSubstituting known emojis:\n🙄 + 🐵 + d + e + r + 🙄 + 🤥 + e + d\n\nIf we hypothesize that it's \"derived\", then 🙄 = 'i' and 🤥 = 'v'. But the feedback said 🤥 is not 'i', so we have to revise. Actually the feedback said 🤥 is not 'i', not 🤮. So 🤥 could be 'v'.\n\nAh, I see the issue now. Let's assign the emojis more systematically:\n\n- 🙄: Was guessed as 'v' in the previous attempt, but that was wrong. If the last part is \"_ derived\", then 🙄 is 'i'.\n- 🐵: Was guessed as 'f' in the previous attempt, but that was wrong. If the phrase is \"is derived\", then 🐵 could be 's'.\n- 🤥: Was guessed as 'i' in the previous attempt, but that was wrong. If the word is \"derived\", then 🤥 could be 'v'.\n\nSo let's go with the hypothesis that the sentence is \"from the word accountant the term accountancy is derived.\"\n\n- 💩=e (confirmed)\n- 🐰=r (confirmed)\n- 🐶=o (confirmed)\n- 🤑=m (confirmed)\n- 🐭=h (confirmed)\n- 😂=a (confirmed)\n- 🧐=u (confirmed)\n- 🥵=y (confirmed)\n- 🤗=w (confirmed)\n- 🤮=d (new guess)\n- 🙄=i (new guess)\n- 🤥=v (new guess)\n- 🐵=s (new guess)\n\nOh, I'm noticing a potential issue. The feedback from the previous guess said 🙄 is not 'v', but I'm now guessing it's 'i'. That seems fine. But 🤥 was guessed as 'i' and was wrong, and now I'm guessing it's 'v', which should be fine. And 🐵 was guessed as 'f' and was wrong, and now I'm guessing it's 's', which should also be fine. So no contradictions there.\n\nWith this set of guesses, the decoded sentence would be:\n\"from the word accountant the term accountancy is derived.\"\n\nThat makes grammatical and semantic sense, so I'm confident in these guesses.\n\nLet's finalize:\n- 💩=e (confirmed)\n- 🐰=r (confirmed)\n- 🐶=o (confirmed)\n- 🤑=m (confirmed)\n- 🐭=h (confirmed)\n- 😂=a (confirmed)\n- 🧐=u (confirmed)\n- 🥵=y (confirmed)\n- 🤗=w (confirmed)\n- 🤮=d (new guess)\n- 🙄=i (new guess)\n- 🤥=v (new guess)\n- 🐵=s (new guess)# Game Analysis\n\nI need to decipher the encoded sentence by determining which letter each emoji represents.\n\n## What I Know:\n- The encoded sentence is: f🐰🐶🤑 t🐭💩 🤗🐶🐰🤮 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt t🐭💩 t💩🐰🤑 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nc🥵 🙄🐵 🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮.\n- Hint: 💩=e\n- From the previous guess, these are correct: 💩=e, 🐰=r, 🐶=o, 🤑=m, 🐭=h, 😂=a, 🧐=u, 🥵=y, 🤗=w\n- These were incorrect: 🤮≠s, 🙄≠v, 🤥≠i, 🐵≠f\n\n## Substituting Known Emojis\nWith the confirmed letters, I get:\n\"from the wor_ accountant the term accountancy _ _er___e_.\"\n\n## Analyzing the Pattern\n- The incomplete \"wor_\" is likely \"word\", so 🤮=d\n- The last part looks like a phrase \"_ _er___e_\"\n- Given the context about accounting terminology, this could be \"is derived\"\n- So 🙄=i, 🐵=s, 🤥=v\n\nThis would make the sentence: \"from the word accountant the term accountancy is derived.\"\n\nThis makes perfect sense grammatically and semantically, explaining how the term \"accountancy\" originated from \"accountant\".\n\n## My Guess for This Round\n💩=e, 🐰=r, 🐶=o, 🤑=m, 🐭=h, 😂=a, 🧐=u, 🥵=y, 🤗=w, 🤮=d, 🙄=i, 🤥=v, 🐵=s\n\nAnswer: 💩=e,🐰=r,🐶=o,🤑=m,🐭=h,😂=a,🧐=u,🥵=y,🤗=w,🤮=d,🙄=i,🤥=v,🐵=s"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

This is a bit confusing but I'll work with it.\n\nLet's start by analyzing common English patterns and trying to match them to the encoded text.\n\nSome common English patterns:\n- 'the': This is one of the most common words in English. It could be represented as '🐶😍👽' since it appears multiple times.\n- Common articles: 'a', 'an', etc.\n- Common prepositions: 'in', 'on', 'at', etc.\n- Common conjunctions: 'and', 'but', 'or', etc.\n\nLet's check if '🐶😍👽' could be 'the':\nIf '👽' is 'e', then if '🐶😍👽' is 'the', '🐶' would be 't' and '😍' would be 'h'.\n\nLet's also try to identify '💩nd'. If 'nd' is the end of 'and', then '💩' would be 'a'.\n\nLet's test these initial guesses:\n- 👽 = e (given)\n- 🐶 = t\n- 😍 = h\n- 💩 = a\n\nWith these guesses, let's see what parts of the sentence we can decipher:\n\n'n🦁te that the 🐹🦁 ster🦆s 🦁n re🤓🦁rd, h🤭rr🤩🤓ane al🤩🤓e 🤮r🦆 the 1954 seas🦁n and tr🦁p🤩🤓al st🦁r🦆 😂eta 🤮r🦆 the 2005 seas🦁n ha🤥e 🤮🦁r🦆ed d🤭r🤩n🥵 de🤓e🦆ber and lasted 🤩nt🦁 🤔an🤭ar🐰.'\n\nThis is starting to make some sense.

This would mean:\n- 🤭 = u\n- 🤩 = i\n- 🤓 = c\n\nTesting further:\n- 👽 = e (given)\n- 🐶 = t\n- 😍 = h\n- 💩 = a\n- 🦁 = o\n- 🤭 = u\n- 🤩 = i\n- 🤓 = c\n\n'note that the 🐹o sterns on record, hurricane alice 🤮r🦆 the 1954 season and tropical stor🦆 😂eta 🤮r🦆 the 2005 season ha🤥e 🤮or🦆ed durin🥵 dece🦆ber and lasted into 🤔anuar🐰.'\n\nIt's getting even clearer. \"alice\" refers to a hurricane, so \"al🤩🤓e\" would be \"alice\", confirming our guesses.\n\nThe phrase \"tropical stor🦆\" likely refers to \"tropical storm\", so 🦆 = m.\n\nAnd \"😂eta\" is likely the name of a tropical storm, \"Beta\". So 😂 = B.\n\nTesting further:\n- 👽 = e (given)\n- 🐶 = t\n- 😍 = h\n- 💩 = a\n- 🦁 = o\n- 🤭 = u\n- 🤩 = i\n- 🤓 = c\n- 🦆 = m\n- 😂 = B\n\n'note that the 🐹o storms on record, hurricane alice 🤮rom the 1954 season and tropical storm Beta 🤮rom the 2005 season ha🤥e 🤮ormed durin🥵 december and lasted into 🤔anuar🐰.'\n\nThe word \"🤮rom\" is likely \"from\", so 🤮 = f.\n\nTesting:\n- 👽 = e (given)\n- 🐶 = t\n- 😍 = h\n- 💩 = a\n- 🦁 = o\n- 🤭 = u\n- 🤩 = i\n- 🤓 = c\n- 🦆 = m\n- 😂 = B\n- 🤮 = f\n\n'note that the 🐹o storms on record, hurricane alice from the 1954 season and tropical storm Beta from the 2005 season ha🤥e formed durin🥵 december and lasted into 🤔anuar🐰.'\n\nThe word \"ha🤥e\" is likely \"have\", so 🤥 = v.\n\nTesting:\n- 👽 = e (given)\n- 🐶 = t\n- 😍 = h\n- 💩 = a\n- 🦁 = o\n- 🤭 = u\n- 🤩 = i\n- 🤓 = c\n- 🦆 = m\n- 😂 = B\n- 🤮 = f\n- 🤥 = v\n\n'note that the 🐹o storms on record, hurricane alice from the 1954 season and tropical storm Beta from the 2005 season have formed durin🥵 december and lasted into 🤔anuar🐰.'\n\nThe word \"durin🥵\" is likely \"during\", so 🥵 = g.\n\nTesting:\n- 👽 = e (given)\n- 🐶 = t\n- 😍 = h\n- 💩 = a\n- 🦁 = o\n- 🤭 = u\n- 🤩 = i\n- 🤓 = c\n- 🦆 = m\n- 😂 = B\n- 🤮 = f\n- 🤥 = v\n- 🥵 = g\n\n'note that the 🐹o storms on record, hurricane alice from the 1954 season and tropical storm Beta from the 2005 season have formed during december and lasted into 🤔anuar🐰.'\n\nThe word \"🤔anuar🐰\" is likely \"January\", so 🤔 = J and 🐰 = y.\n\nTesting:\n- 👽 = e (given)\n- 🐶 = t\n- 😍 = h\n- 💩 = a\n- 🦁 = o\n- 🤭 = u\n- 🤩 = i\n- 🤓 = c\n- 🦆 = m\n- 😂 = B\n- 🤮 = f\n- 🤥 = v\n- 🥵 = g\n- 🤔 = J\n- 🐰 = y\n\n'note that the 🐹o storms on record, hurricane alice from the 1954 season and tropical storm Beta from the 2005 season have formed during december and lasted into January.'\n\nFinally, the word \"🐹o\" in \"the 🐹o storms\" is likely \"two\". So 🐹 = w.\n\nTesting:\n- 👽 = e (given)\n- 🐶 = t\n- 😍 = h\n- 💩 = a\n- 🦁 = o\n- 🤭 = u\n- 🤩 = i\n- 🤓 = c\n- 🦆 = m\n- 😂 = B\n- 🤮 = f\n- 🤥 = v\n- 🥵 = g\n- 🤔 = J\n- 🐰 = y\n- 🐹 = w\n\n'note that the two storms on record, hurricane alice from the 1954 season and tropical storm Beta from the 2005 season have formed during december and lasted into January.'\n\nGreat! The sentence is now fully decoded and makes sense.\n\nLet's double-check our work by re-examining the original encoded sentence and ensuring all emojis have been decoded correctly:\n\n```\nn🦁🐶👽 🐶😍💩🐶 🐶🐹🦁 s🐶🦁r🦆s 🦁n r👽🤓🦁rd, 😍🤭rr🤩🤓💩n👽 💩l🤩🤓👽 🤮r🦁🦆 🐶😍👽 1954 s👽💩s🦁n 💩nd 🐶r🦁p🤩🤓💩l s🐶🦁r🦆 😂👽🐶💩 🤮r🦁🦆 🐶😍👽 2005 s👽💩s🦁n 😍💩🤥👽 🤮🦁r🦆👽d d🤭r🤩n🥵 d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r 💩nd l💩s🐶👽d 🤩n🐶🦁 🤔💩n🤭💩r🐰.\n```\n\nAnd our decoding:\n- 👽 = e (given)\n- 🐶 = t\n- 😍 = h\n- 💩 = a\n- 🦁 = o\n- 🤭 = u\n- 🤩 = i\n- 🤓 = c\n- 🦆 = m\n- 😂 = B\n- 🤮 = f\n- 🤥 = v\n- 🥵 = g\n- 🤔 = J\n- 🐰 = y\n- 🐹 = w\n\nApplying this to the encoded sentence:\n\n'note that the two storms on record, hurricane alice from the 1954 season and tropical storm Beta from the 2005 season have formed during december and lasted into January.'\n\nThis sentence makes perfect sense, so I'm confident in my decoding.\n\nLet me check the required format for the answer:\nI should list out the emojis and their corresponding letters, separated by commas, in the format 'emoji=letter'. I should include the hint that 👽=e.\n\nMy final answer is:\n👽=e, 🐶=t, 😍=h, 💩=a, 🦁=o, 🤭=u, 🤩=i, 🤓=c, 🦆=m, 😂=B, 🤮=f, 🤥=v, 🥵=g, 🤔=J, 🐰=y, 🐹=w\n\nHowever, I notice that there might be confusion with the standard format. The examples show 'emoji=word', but since each emoji represents a single letter, I'll go with 'emoji=letter'. But let me re-read the instructions to make sure.\n\nThe instructions say to submit guesses in the format 'emoji=word', separated by commas. But since each emoji represents a single letter, not a word, I'll use the format 'emoji=letter'.# Crypto Word Game Analysis\n\nLooking at the encoded sentence, I can see that 👽 represents the letter 'e' as per the hint. Let me analyze the rest of the emojis to decode the message.\n\nFirst, I'll look for common patterns and English language structures:\n\n1. Based on word structure and frequency, I believe that:\n   - 🐶 appears to be 't' (appears in common positions)\n   - 😍 likely represents 'h' (often follows 't')\n   - 💩 seems to be 'a' (common letter, appears in expected positions)\n   - 🦁 is probably 'o' (frequent vowel)\n\n2. Looking at the context about storms:\n   - 🤩 must be 'i' (appears in \"hurricane\")\n   - 🤓 appears to be 'c' (in \"hurricane\" and other words)\n   - 🦆 is likely 'm' (in \"storms\")\n   - 🤮 seems to be 'f' (in \"from\")\n   - 😂 must be 'B' (capital letter for storm name \"Beta\")\n\n3. For the remaining emojis:\n   - 🤭 is 'u' (in \"hurricane\")\n   - 🤥 is 'v' (in \"have\")\n   - 🥵 is 'g' (in \"during\")\n   - 🤔 is 'J' (for \"January\")\n   - 🐰 is 'y' (at the end of \"January\")\n   - 🐹 is 'w' (in \"two\")\n\nWith these translations, the sentence reads:\n\"Note that the two storms on record, hurricane alice from the 1954 season and tropical storm Beta from the 2005 season have formed during december and lasted into January.\"\n\nAnswer: 👽=e,🐶=t,😍=h,💩=a,🦁=o,🤭=u,🤩=i,🤓=c,🦆=m,😂=B,🤮=f,🤥=v,🥵=g,🤔=J,🐰=y,🐹=w","I need to analyze the encoded sentence and the feedback from the first guess.\n\nAccording to the feedback, all my guesses were correct except for '😂=B'. Let's analyze the encoded sentence again, focusing on finding what '😂' should be:\n\nEncoded Sentence: \nn🦁🐶👽 🐶😍💩🐶 🐶🐹🦁 s🐶🦁r🦆s 🦁n r👽🤓🦁rd, 😍🤭rr🤩🤓💩n👽 💩l🤩🤓👽 🤮r🦁🦆 🐶😍👽 1954 s👽💩s🦁n 💩nd 🐶r🦁p🤩🤓💩l s🐶🦁r🦆 😂👽🐶💩 🤮r🦁🦆 🐶😍👽 2005 s👽💩s🦁n 😍💩🤥👽 🤮🦁r🦆👽d d🤭r🤩n🥵 d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r 💩nd l💩s🐶👽d 🤩n🐶🦁 🤔💩n🤭💩r🐰.\n\nWith my previous correct guesses:\n👽=e, 🐶=t, 😍=h, 💩=a, 🦁=o, 🤭=u, 🤩=i, 🤓=c, 🦆=m, 🤮=f, 🤥=v, 🥵=g, 🤔=J, 🐰=y, 🐹=w\n\nLet's substitute these into the encoded sentence:\n\nnote that two storms on record, hurricane alice from the 1954 season and tropical storm 😂eta from the 2005 season have formed during december and lasted into January.\n\nSo '😂' appears in what seems to be \"😂eta\", which would be a letter followed by \"eta\". Looking at this context, it's most likely \"Beta\", a Greek letter used for naming storms. So '😂' should be 'b'.\n\nLet me check if there are any other emojis in the sentence that I haven't guessed yet:\n\nThe emoji '🤔' is identified as 'J', but it's part of \"January\" which should start with a capital 'J', so that's correct.\n\nI'm still missing the letter 'p' that appears in \"tro🐶ical\". Let me look for which emoji represents 'p':\n\nChecking again, I see \"tro🐶p🤩🤓💩l\" - so there's another emoji I need to identify between 't' and 'i'.\n\nLooking at \"tro🐶ical\" again, I see it's actually \"tro🐶p🤩🤓💩l\", so I'm missing the identification for 'p'.\n\nLet me examine the encoding again, focusing on the word I think is \"tropical\":\n\"🐶r🦁p🤩🤓💩l\"\n\nThis would be \"tropiᵐcal\" with my current mappings, which doesn't make sense. So there must be another emoji that I haven't identified yet.\n\nThe word should be \"tropical\", so let's see what's in place of 'p':\n\"🐶r🦁p🤩🤓💩l\"\n\nI specified '🐶=t', '🦁=o', '🤩=i', '🤓=c', '💩=a', and 'l' is not encoded. So 'r' and 'p' are still encoded with emoji that I need to identify.\n\nLet me review the emojis that I haven't fully identified yet:\n- 'p'\n- 'r'\n- Any other letters that might appear in the sentence\n\nWait, I need to be more careful with my analysis. Let me go through the entire sentence and substitute the known emojis:\n\nn🦁🐶👽 🐶😍💩🐶 🐶🐹🦁 s🐶🦁r🦆s 🦁n r👽🤓🦁rd, 😍🤭rr🤩🤓💩n👽 💩l🤩🤓👽 🤮r🦁🦆 🐶😍👽 1954 s👽💩s🦁n 💩nd 🐶r🦁p🤩🤓💩l s🐶🦁r🦆 😂👽🐶💩 🤮r🦁🦆 🐶😍👽 2005 s👽💩s🦁n 😍💩🤥👽 🤮🦁r🦆👽d d🤭r🤩n🥵 d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r 💩nd l💩s🐶👽d 🤩n🐶🦁 🤔💩n🤭💩r🐰.\n\nSubstituting:\nnote that two storms on record, hurricane alice from the 1954 season and t_o_ical storm 😂eta from the 2005 season have formed du_ing december and lasted into January.\n\nI'm still missing some letter encodings. Let me list all the emojis in the sentence and see which ones I haven't identified yet:\n\n🦁 = o\n🐶 = t\n👽 = e\n😍 = h\n💩 = a\n🐹 = w\ns = s (not encoded)\nr = r (not encoded)\n🦆 = m\nn = n (not encoded)\n🤓 = c\n🤭 = u\n🤩 = i\nl = l (not encoded)\n🤮 = f\np = p (not encoded)\n😂 = b (my updated guess)\n🤥 = v\nd = d (not encoded)\n🥵 = g\n🤔 = J\n🐰 = y\n\nI realize that I may have made a mistake in my analysis. Let me restart by substituting all the emojis I know into the sentence:\n\nn🦁🐶👽 🐶😍💩🐶 🐶🐹🦁 s🐶🦁r🦆s 🦁n r👽🤓🦁rd, 😍🤭rr🤩🤓💩n👽 💩l🤩🤓👽 🤮r🦁🦆 🐶😍👽 1954 s👽💩s🦁n 💩nd 🐶r🦁p🤩🤓💩l s🐶🦁r🦆 😂👽🐶💩 🤮r🦁🦆 🐶😍👽 2005 s👽💩s🦁n 😍💩🤥👽 🤮🦁r🦆👽d d🤭r🤩n🥵 d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r 💩nd l💩s🐶👽d 🤩n🐶🦁 🤔💩n🤭💩r🐰.\n\nBecomes:\nnote that two storms on record, hurricane alice from the 1954 season and tropical storm beta from the 2005 season have formed during december and lasted into January.\n\nThat actually looks like a complete and sensible sentence. Let me double-check that I've correctly mapped all the emojis to their corresponding letters:\n\n👽=e (given as hint)\n🐶=t (correctly guessed)\n😍=h (correctly guessed)\n💩=a (correctly guessed)\n🦁=o (correctly guessed)\n🤭=u (correctly guessed)\n🤩=i (correctly guessed)\n🤓=c (correctly guessed)\n🦆=m (correctly guessed)\n😂=b (my updated guess, was incorrectly guessed as B before)\n🤮=f (correctly guessed)\n🤥=v (correctly guessed)\n🥵=g (correctly guessed)\n🤔=J (correctly guessed)\n🐰=y (correctly guessed)\n🐹=w (correctly guessed)\n\nLet's check for any emojis that might appear in the encoded sentence that I haven't identified yet:\n\nn🦁🐶👽 🐶😍💩🐶 🐶🐹🦁 s🐶🦁r🦆s 🦁n r👽🤓🦁rd, 😍🤭rr🤩🤓💩n👽 💩l🤩🤓👽 🤮r🦁🦆 🐶😍👽 1954 s👽💩s🦁n 💩nd 🐶r🦁p🤩🤓💩l s🐶🦁r🦆 😂👽🐶💩 🤮r🦁🦆 🐶😍👽 2005 s👽💩s🦁n 😍💩🤥👽 🤮🦁r🦆👽d d🤭r🤩n🥵 d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r 💩nd l💩s🐶👽d 🤩n🐶🦁 🤔💩n🤭💩r🐰.\n\nI don't see any emojis that I haven't identified yet. The sentence makes sense with my current mappings. \n\nI initially guessed '😂=B' (capital B), but the feedback indicated this was incorrect. The context suggests it should be '😂=b' (lowercase b) for \"beta\" in \"tropical storm beta\".\n\nSo my updated and complete answer is:\n👽=e, 🐶=t, 😍=h, 💩=a, 🦁=o, 🤭=u, 🤩=i, 🤓=c, 🦆=m, 😂=b, 🤮=f, 🤥=v, 🥵=g, 🤔=J, 🐰=y, 🐹=wBased on the encoded sentence and the feedback from my first guess, I need to correct one emoji assignment.\n\nLooking at the sentence with my previous correct guesses substituted:\n\n\"note that two storms on record, hurricane alice from the 1954 season and tropical storm [😂]eta from the 2005 season have formed during december and lasted into January.\"\n\nThe only incorrect guess from my first attempt was '😂=B'. In the context of the sentence, this appears in what must be \"Beta\" - a Greek letter commonly used in naming tropical storms. Since it's not a capital B, it must be a lowercase 'b'.\n\nThe complete sentence with all substitutions would read:\n\"note that two storms on record, hurricane alice from the 1954 season and tropical storm beta from the 2005 season have formed during december and lasted into January.\"\n\nThis makes perfect sense as a factual statement about named storms.\n\nAnswer: 👽=e,🐶=t,😍=h,💩=a,🦁=o,🤭=u,🤩=i,🤓=c,🦆=m,😂=b,🤮=f,🤥=v,🥵=g,🤔=J,🐰=y,🐹=w","Let's analyze the encoded sentence and the feedback so far.\n\nFrom the hint and history, I know that:\n\n- 👽=e (confirmed)\n- 🐶=t (confirmed)\n- 😍=h (confirmed)\n- 💩=a (confirmed)\n- 🦁=o (confirmed)\n- 🤭=u (confirmed)\n- 🤩=i (confirmed)\n- 🤓=c (confirmed)\n- 🦆=m (confirmed)\n- 🤮=f (confirmed)\n- 🤥=v (confirmed)\n- 🥵=g (confirmed)\n- 🤔=J (confirmed)\n- 🐰=y (confirmed)\n- 🐹=w (confirmed)\n\nWe've tried 😂=B and 😂=b, but both are wrong.\n\nLet's substitute these confirmed letters into the sentence to see what we have:\n\n\"nowe the two storm teams on record, hurricane alove from the 1954 season and tropical storm ?eta from the 2005 season have formed during december and lasted into January.\"\n\nLet's check the words that still have unknown letters:\n\n1. \"n🦁🐶👽\" = \"note\"?\n2. \"s🐶🦁r🦆\" = \"storm\"\n3. \"r👽🤓🦁rd\" = \"record\"\n4. \"😍🤭rr🤩🤓💩n👽\" = \"hurricane\"\n5. \"💩l🤩🤓👽\" = \"alice\"? (this is a hurricane name)\n6. \"s👽💩s🦁n\" = \"season\"\n7. \"😂👽🐶💩\" = \"?eta\" - this might be \"Zeta\", a hurricane name\n8. \"d🤭r🤩n🥵\" = \"during\"\n9. \"d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r\" = \"december\"\n10. \"l💩s🐶👽d\" = \"lasted\"\n11. \"🤩n🐶🦁\" = \"into\"\n12. \"🤔💩n🤭💩r🐰\" = \"January\"\n\nWith these substitutions, let's try 😂=Z for \"Zeta\".\n\nSo, for my next guess, I will include all the confirmed letters plus 😂=Z:\n\n👽=e,🐶=t,😍=h,💩=a,🦁=o,🤭=u,🤩=i,🤓=c,🦆=m,😂=Z,🤮=f,🤥=v,🥵=g,🤔=J,🐰=y,🐹=wBased on the encoded sentence and the feedback from my previous guesses, I can now reconstruct more of the message.\n\nWith all the confirmed letters substituted:\n\"nowe the two storm teams on record, hurricane alove from the 1954 season and tropical storm ?eta from the 2005 season have formed during december and lasted into January.\"\n\nLooking at the weather context, this seems to be about hurricane records. The unknown emoji 😂 appears in what looks like a hurricane name \"?eta\". Given the 2005 hurricane season included Hurricane Zeta, I believe 😂=Z.\n\nLet me make my guess for this round:\n\nAnswer: 👽=e,🐶=t,😍=h,💩=a,🦁=o,🤭=u,🤩=i,🤓=c,🦆=m,😂=Z,🤮=f,🤥=v,🥵=g,🤔=J,🐰=y,🐹=w"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

There are punctuation marks including commas and periods\n\nLet me try to identify common patterns:\n- The sentence structure might follow English grammar\n- Short words could be articles or prepositions (a, an, the, in, on, etc.)\n- Words ending with 's' might indicate plurals\n- There are likely spaces between words\n\nLet's look at common single-letter words:\n- 👽🐱 appears to be a two-letter word\n- Consider if it's \"in\", \"on\", \"at\", \"as\", etc.\n\nVery common letters in English are E, T, A (which we know), O, I, N.\n\nLet's look for possible \"the\" since it's one of the most common words:\n- 👽🦊🤑 is a three-letter word\n- 👽🦊🤑 might be \"the\" where 👽=t, 🦊=h, 🤑=e\n\nLet me analyze the word patterns, especially those that might be familiar phrases:\n\n1. 🥵👽 - If 🥵=a, then this might be \"at\" or \"an\"\n   - If 👽=t, then this would be \"at\"\n   - If 👽=n, then this would be \"an\"\n\n2. 👽🦊🤑 - If 👽=t, this could be \"the\"\n\n3. 🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈 - A longer word starting with \"a\"\n   - Could be \"american\", \"attention\", etc.\n\nSince the hint shows 🥵=a, let's start with common patterns:\n- \"and\" might appear\n- \"the\" might appear\n\nLet's try a few common combinations:\n- If 👽=t and 🦊=h and 🤑=e, then 👽🦊🤑 = \"the\"\n- If 🐱=i or 🐱=o, 👽🐱 could be \"to\" or \"in\"\n- 🐱😈 could be \"is\", \"in\", \"it\", etc.\n\nGiven the pattern of the encoded text and the hint 🥵=a, I'm making educated guesses for several emoji-letter pairs:\n\n🥵=a (given)\n👽=t (guessing based on 🥵👽 being \"at\")\n🦊=h (guessing from 👽🦊🤑 potentially being \"the\")\n🤑=e (complementing the \"the\" guess)\n🐱=i (common letter, fits patterns)\n😈=s (guessing based on common letter placement)\n\nLet me see if these initial guesses make sense in the encoded message:\n\nWith these guesses, let's partially decode:\n🥵👽 = at\n👽🦊🤑 = the\n🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈 = a?e???as (could be \"americans\"?)\n🦁🥵👻🦊 = ?a?h\n🐱😈 = is\netc.\n\nThe date part \"🥶🤫🥳🤓 20, 2008\" might be \"July 20, 2008\" or similar.\n\nLet's continue analyzing the message. If we have common suffixes like \"-ing\", \"-ed\", etc., that can help us identify more letters.\n\nGiven the date format, this might be describing an event that happened on a specific date. The structure suggests a news headline or historical statement.\n\nLet me try more potential matches:\n🐵 could be 'r' or 'n'\n🧐 could be 'm'\n🐶 could be 'c' or 'd'\n🐸 could be 'n' or 'l'\n\nLet's try to construct more of the message:\n\"At the great american ?a?h is ???? 20, 2008, ?????? ?e?ea?e? ?a?a??a ?? ?e???e ?he ???????? ??a? ?ha???i??.\"\n\nThis still doesn't fully make sense, so I need to refine my guesses. Let me try a different approach by considering common English word patterns and typical sentence structures.\n\nBased on the context and the fact this includes a date (20, 2008), this might be describing a historical event, sports achievement, or news item from 2008.\n\nLet me revise my guesses:\n🥵=a (given)\n👽=t (still seems likely)\n🦊=h (still seems likely)\n🤑=e (still seems likely)\n🐱=i (still seems likely)\n😈=s (still seems likely)\n🐵=r (new guess)\n🐶=c (new guess)\n🧐=m (new guess)\n🐸=n (new guess)\n\nWith these revised guesses, let me try again:\n\"At the great american ?ath is ???? 20, 2008, ?????? ?e?ea?e? ?a?a??a ?? ?e???e ?he ???????? ??a? ?ham?i??.\"\n\nThis is starting to look more like a coherent sentence. It might be about someone becoming a champion of something on July 20, 2008.\n\nLet me make my final guesses for this round:\n\n🥵=a (given)\n👽=t (strong confidence)\n🦊=h (strong confidence)\n🤑=e (strong confidence)\n🐱=i (strong confidence)\n😈=s (strong confidence)\n🐵=r (medium confidence)\n🐶=c (medium confidence)\n🧐=m (medium confidence)\n🐸=n (medium confidence)\n🦁=w or b (low confidence)\n👻=r or g (low confidence)\n🥺=p (low confidence)\n🤧=k (low confidence)\n🤫=j (low confidence)\n🥳=l or u (low confidence)\n🤓=y (low confidence)\n🥶=J (capital letter, since before date)\n😴=v (low confidence)\n\nI'll submit my answer with the letters I have the most confidence in, including the given hint:\n\n🥵=a (given)\n👽=t\n🦊=h\n🤑=e\n🐱=i\n😈=s\n🐵=r\n🐶=c\n🧐=m\n🐸=nLooking at this crypto word game, I need to decode a sentence where each emoji represents a letter, with the hint that 🥵=a.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the pattern of the encoded message. I notice there are some short words, which in English are often articles, prepositions, or pronouns. The date \"20, 2008\" gives me a reference point in the sentence.\n\nLet me try to identify some common English patterns:\n- 🥵👽 could be \"at\" or \"an\"\n- 👽🦊🤑 might be \"the\" (a very common three-letter word)\n- 🐱😈 could be \"is\" or \"in\"\n\nBased on word length patterns and frequencies of emojis in the sentence, I'll make these educated guesses:\n\n- 🥵=a (given)\n- 👽=t (appears frequently, often paired with 'a')\n- 🦊=h (likely follows 't' in \"the\")\n- 🤑=e (one of the most common letters in English)\n- 🐱=i (common vowel)\n- 😈=s (frequent letter that often ends words)\n- 🐵=r (common consonant)\n- 🧐=m (appears in positions consistent with 'm')\n- 🐸=n (high-frequency letter)\n- 🐶=c (fits word patterns)\n\nThis gives me partial decoding like: \"at the great american...\" which seems promising but I need more context for the full sentence.\n\nAnswer: 🥵=a,👽=t,🦊=h,🤑=e,🐱=i,😈=s,🐵=r,🧐=m,🐸=n,🐶=c","HTTPError 529: {\"error\":{\"message\":\"-4316: Overloaded\",\"code\":\"-4307\"}}","Let's analyze the encoded sentence given the hint and previous feedback:\n\n```\n🥵👽 👽🦊🤑 🐰🐵🤑🥵👽 🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈 🦁🥵👻🦊 🐱😈 🥶🤫🥳🤓 20, 2008, 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳 🥺🤑😴🤑🥵👽🤑🥺 😈🥵👽🥵🥳🤓🥵 👽🐱 🦁🤑🐸🐱🧐🤑 👽🦊🤑 🐶😈🥵🤫🐰🤫🐵🥵🥳 🥺🐶🤧🥵👻 🐸🦊🥵🧐😇🐶🐱😈.\n```\n\nFrom the previous feedback, we know:\n- 🥵=a (confirmed correct)\n- 👽=t (confirmed correct)\n- 🦊=h (confirmed correct)\n- 🤑=e (confirmed correct)\n- 🐱=i (incorrect)\n- 😈=s (incorrect)\n- 🐵=r (confirmed correct)\n- 🧐=m (confirmed correct)\n- 🐸=n (incorrect)\n- 🐶=c (incorrect)\n\nNow let's try to make progress by examining common patterns and words.\n\nThe first word is 🥵👽, which would be \"at\".\n\nThe second word is 👽🦊🤑, which would be \"the\".\n\nSo the sentence starts with \"at the...\"\n\nThe third word is 🐰🐵🤑🥵👽, and we know a, t, h, e, r are correct. So this is a 5-letter word with pattern _reat. \nConsidering English words, this could be \"great\".\n\nLet's assume 🐰=g for now.\n\nThe fourth word is 🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈, which has \"amer_a_\", where 🐶 and 🐸 were incorrect guesses. Let's try to think what this could be. \nIt could be \"american\", so 🐶 might be i and 🐸 might be n, but we already know those are incorrect.\nLet's tentatively assume this is \"american\", but we need to revise 🐶 and 🐸.\n\nLooking at the date format \"🥶🤫🥳🤓 20, 2008\", this is likely \"June 20, 2008\" or \"July 20, 2008\".\n\nLet's keep going. The words \"🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳\" might be \"million\" given the context of a date.\n\nThe phrase \"🥺🤑😴🤑🥵👽🤑🥺 😈🥵👽🥵🥳🤓🥵\" might be \"revealed statute\" or something similar.\n\nLet's work through some more emojis:\n\n🐱 was incorrectly guessed as \"i\". In the phrase \"the great amer_a_\", it could be \"american\". So 🐱 might be \"c\".\n😈 was incorrectly guessed as \"s\". It's used in words like \"revealed _tatute\", so 😈 might be \"s\" after all.\n🐸 was incorrectly guessed as \"n\". In \"million\", 🐸 might be \"l\".\n🐶 was incorrectly guessed as \"c\". In \"american\", 🐶 might be \"i\".\n\nBut there's inconsistency. I had feedback that 🐱=i (incorrect), 😈=s (incorrect), 🐸=n (incorrect), 🐶=c (incorrect).\n\nLet me try interpreting the encoded sentence without those incorrect guesses:\n\n```\n🥵👽 👽🦊🤑 🐰🐵🤑🥵👽 🥵🧐🤑🐵_ _🥵_ 🦁🥵_ 🦊 _ _ _ _ 20, 2008, _ _ _ _ _ _ 🥺🤑_ 🤑🥵👽🤑🥺 _🥵👽🥵_ _🥵 👽_ 🦁🤑_ _🧐🤑 👽🦊🤑 _ _ 🥵_ _ 🐵🥵_ 🥺_ _🥵_ _ 🦊🥵🧐_ _ _ _.\n```\n\nI need to reconsider. Let's step back and look for common words and patterns.\n\nWe have \"at the\" and then likely a 5-letter word starting with _ and ending with \"reat\". That's probably \"great\".\n\nLet's analyze the rest more carefully:\n\n\"🥵👽 👽🦊🤑 🐰🐵🤑🥵👽 🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈 🦁🥵👻🦊\"\n\nThis might be \"at the great american bash\" if 🐰=g, 🐶=i, 🐸=c, 😈=a, 🦁=b, 👻=a.\n\nBut wait, 😈 was guessed as \"s\" and was incorrect. It can't be \"a\". And 🥵 is already confirmed as \"a\".\n\nSo maybe \"at the great american with\". \n\nI need to be more methodical.\n\nLet's try using the context of the date and common phrases to fill in more words:\n\n\"🥵👽 👽🦊🤑 🐰🐵🤑🥵👽 🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈 🦁🥵👻🦊 🐱😈 🥶🤫🥳🤓 20, 2008,\"\n\nIf this is about an event, it might be \"at the great american bash on June 20, 2008,\"\n\nLet's try to fill in more:\n\n🐰=g (guess)\n🦁=b (guess)\n👻=a is not possible since 🥵=a. Maybe 👻=s?\n🐱=i was incorrect. Maybe 🐱=o?\n😈=s was incorrect. Maybe 😈=n?\n🐸=n was incorrect. Maybe 🐸=c?\n🐶=c was incorrect. Maybe 🐶=i?\n\nSo \"at the great american bash on June 20, 2008,\"\n\nThe next part \"🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳 🥺🤑😴🤑🥵👽🤑🥺 😈🥵👽🥵🥳🤓🥵\"\n\nIf 🐸=c, 🐱=o, and 🥳=l, then 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳 could be \"mccoil\" or \"mcmool\". Neither makes sense.\n\nLet me re-evaluate using the feedback:\n- 🥵=a (confirmed correct)\n- 👽=t (confirmed correct)\n- 🦊=h (confirmed correct)\n- 🤑=e (confirmed correct)\n- 🐱=i (incorrect)\n- 😈=s (incorrect)\n- 🐵=r (confirmed correct)\n- 🧐=m (confirmed correct)\n- 🐸=n (incorrect)\n- 🐶=c (incorrect)\n\nLet's look again:\n\"🥵👽 👽🦊🤑 🐰🐵🤑🥵👽 🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈 🦁🥵👻🦊\"\n\nIf 🐰=g, we have \"at the great amer??a?\".\nThe word \"american\" might fit here, but 🐸 isn't \"n\" and 🐶 isn't \"c\" according to feedback.\n\nLet's check if these emojis appear in other words:\n- 🐸 appears in \"🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳\", which could be a name or a title.\n- 🐶 appears in \"🐶😈🥵🤫🐰🤫🐵🥵🥳\", another possible name or title.\n\nThis is challenging without knowing the context, but it seems like a factual statement about an event or an announcement on June 20, 2008.\n\nWait, let me check the frequency of the emojis to see if I can identify common letters:\n\n🥵 appears frequently, which we know is \"a\".\n👽 appears several times, which we confirmed is \"t\".\n🦊 appears several times, which we confirmed is \"h\".\n🤑 appears several times, which we confirmed is \"e\".\n\nThese are indeed common letters in English.\n\nLet's try more guesses:\n🐰 might be \"g\" as in \"great\".\n🦁 might be \"b\" as in \"bash\" or \"before\".\n👻 could be \"s\" if the word is \"bash\".\n🐱 was incorrect as \"i\". It could be \"o\" or \"u\" or another vowel.\n😈 was incorrect as \"s\". It could be \"n\", \"d\", or another common consonant.\n🐸 was incorrect as \"n\". It could be \"c\", \"l\", or \"p\".\n🐶 was incorrect as \"c\". It could be \"i\", \"a\", or another vowel.\n\nContinuing my analysis, let me try to make more sense of the sentence:\n\n\"🥵👽 👽🦊🤑 🐰🐵🤑🥵👽 🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈 🦁🥵👻🦊 🐱😈 🥶🤫🥳🤓 20, 2008,\"\n\nGiven the pattern, it's likely: \"at the great american bash on June 20, 2008,\"\n\nFor the next part:\n\"🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳 🥺🤑😴🤑🥵👽🤑🥺 😈🥵👽🥵🥳🤓🥵 👽🐱 🦁🤑🐸🐱🧐🤑 👽🦊🤑 🐶😈🥵🤫🐰🤫🐵🥵🥳 🥺🐶🤧🥵👻 🐸🦊🥵🧐😇🐶🐱😈.\"\n\nAnd if 🐸 is \"l\", it becomes:\n\"mllool revealed statule to belome the islupural slwas lhamdios.\"\n\nThis doesn't make sense. I need to reconsider the emojis.\n\nActually, I think I was on the right track with 🐰=g. The phrase \"at the great american\" suggests this is a historical or news context. Maybe it's about the Great American Bailout or something related to the 2008 financial crisis?\n\nLet me try a different approach. I'll assign tentative values to emojis based on the context and try to make sense of the sentence:\n\n🥵=a (confirmed)\n👽=t (confirmed)\n🦊=h (confirmed)\n🤑=e (confirmed)\n🐵=r (confirmed)\n🧐=m (confirmed)\n🐰=g (guessing)\n🦁=b (guessing)\n👻=s (guessing)\n🐱=o (guessing)\n😈=n (guessing)\n🐸=l (guessing)\n🐶=i (guessing)\n🥺=d (guessing)\n😴=v (guessing)\n🥳=y (guessing)\n🤫=u (guessing)\n🥶=j (guessing)\n🤓=p (guessing)\n🤧=k (guessing)\n😇=p (guessing)\n\nNow let's try to read the sentence:\n\"at the great american bash on June 20, 2008, mllooy revealed statute to belome the diplomacy slkas lhamdios.\"\n\nStill not making complete sense, but there are patterns. Let me reconsider.\n\nLet me focus more on the grammatical structure:\n\n\"at the great american 🦁🥵👻🦊 on 🥶🤫🥳🤓 20, 2008, 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳 🥺🤑😴🤑🥵👽🤑🥺 😈🥵👽🥵🥳🤓🥵 to 🦁🤑🐸🐱🧐🤑 the 🐶😈🥵🤫🐰🤫🐵🥵🥳 🥺🐶🤧🥵👻 🐸🦊🥵🧐😇🐶🐱😈.\"\n\nIf \"at the great american\" is followed by an event or location, then \"bash\" makes sense. If so, 🦁=b, 🥵=a, 👻=s, 🦊=h.\n\nThis would be \"at the great american bash on June 20, 2008, [something] revealed [something] to become the [something] [something] champion.\"\n\nThis sounds like a wrestling or sports event. The Great American Bash is a WWE event, so this could be a statement about a wrestling match on June 20, 2008.\n\nLet me reconsider some emojis based on this context:\n\n🐱 might be \"o\" if it's part of words like \"on\" or \"to\".\n😈 might be \"d\" if there's a word like \"defense\" or \"defeated\".\n🐸 might be \"c\" if there's a word like \"become\" or \"chance\".\n🐶 might be \"i\" if there are words like \"time\" or \"title\".\n\nLet me read the sentence again with these guesses:\n\"at the great american bash on June 20, 2008, mccooy revealed statute to become the inaugural dick champion.\"\n\nI'm still missing some words, but given the context, I think this is about a WWE event where a championship was established or changed.\n\nLet me revise once more:\n🥵=a (confirmed)\n👽=t (confirmed)\n🦊=h (confirmed)\n🤑=e (confirmed)\n🐵=r (confirmed)\n🧐=m (confirmed)\n🐰=g (guessing)\n🦁=b (guessing)\n👻=s (guessing)\n🐱=o (guessing)\n😈=n (guessing)\n🐸=c (guessing)\n🐶=i (guessing)\n🥺=d (guessing)\n😴=v (guessing)\n🥳=y (guessing)\n🤫=u (guessing)\n🥶=j (guessing)\n🤓=e (already have 🤑=e, so this is likely incorrect)\n🤧=k (guessing)\n😇=p (guessing)\n\n\"at the great american bash on june 20, 2008, mccooy revealed status to become the inaugural dick champion.\"\n\nThis is closer, but still not perfect. Let me think of alternative interpretations for some of the emojis.\n\nActually, based on the context of a wrestling event and championships, let's revisit the phrase \"inaugural dick champion.\" This doesn't seem right. It might be \"inaugural divas champion\" if this is about women's wrestling. In that case, 🐶=v and 🤧=a. But 🐶 was guessed as \"c\" before and found to be incorrect.\n\nLet me try a fresh approach:\n\n\"🥵👽 👽🦊🤑 🐰🐵🤑🥵👽 🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈 🦁🥵👻🦊 🐱😈 🥶🤫🥳🤓 20, 2008, 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳 🥺🤑😴🤑🥵👽🤑🥺 😈🥵👽🥵🥳🤓🥵 👽🐱 🦁🤑🐸🐱🧐🤑 👽🦊🤑 🐶😈🥵🤫🐰🤫🐵🥵🥳 🥺🐶🤧🥵👻 🐸🦊🥵🧐😇🐶🐱😈.\"\n\nLet's make all my guesses now:\n🥵=a (confirmed)\n👽=t (confirmed)\n🦊=h (confirmed)\n🤑=e (confirmed)\n🐵=r (confirmed)\n🧐=m (confirmed)\n🐰=g (guessing)\n🦁=b (guessing)\n👻=s (guessing)\n🐱=o (guessing)\n😈=n (guessing)\n🐸=l (guessing)\n🐶=i (guessing)\n🥺=d (guessing)\n😴=v (guessing)\n🥳=y (guessing)\n🤫=u (guessing)\n🥶=j (guessing)\n🤓=n (guessing, but must be different from 😈 if that's also \"n\")\n🤧=k (guessing)\n😇=p (guessing)\n\n\"at the great american bash on june 20, 2008, mllool revealed statute to belome the inaugural divas lhampiosh.\"\n\nOK I admit I'm struggling here, so let me do one more pass:\n\nLooking at the previous feedback, we know:\n- 🥵=a (confirmed correct)\n- 👽=t (confirmed correct)\n- 🦊=h (confirmed correct)\n- 🤑=e (confirmed correct)\n- 🐱=i (incorrect)\n- 😈=s (incorrect)\n- 🐵=r (confirmed correct)\n- 🧐=m (confirmed correct)\n- 🐸=n (incorrect)\n- 🐶=c (incorrect)\n\nThe sentence is:\n\"🥵👽 👽🦊🤑 🐰🐵🤑🥵👽 🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈 🦁🥵👻🦊 🐱😈 🥶🤫🥳🤓 20, 2008, 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳 🥺🤑😴🤑🥵👽🤑🥺 😈🥵👽🥵🥳🤓🥵 👽🐱 🦁🤑🐸🐱🧐🤑 👽🦊🤑 🐶😈🥵🤫🐰🤫🐵🥵🥳 🥺🐶🤧🥵👻 🐸🦊🥵🧐😇🐶🐱😈.\"\n\nLet's re-analyze the structure to see if we can identify common words.\n\n\"at the great amer??a? ?a?h ?? ???? 20, 2008, m????? ?e?eate? ?tat??e t? ?e??me the ?????ura? ???a? ?ham????\"\n\nThis looks like it's about a WWE event, specifically The Great American Bash, held on June 20, 2008.

The date format suggests \"June 20, 2008\" and the context seems to be about a championship.\n\nAnalyzing patterns and common English words, and considering the wrestling context, here are my guesses for this round:\n\n🥵=a (confirmed)\n👽=t (confirmed)\n🦊=h (confirmed)\n🤑=e (confirmed)\n🐵=r (confirmed)\n🧐=m (confirmed)\n🐰=g (guessing this forms \"great\")\n🦁=b (likely for \"bash\" or \"become\")\n👻=s (possibly for \"bash\")\n🐱=o (appears in positions where \"o\" would make sense)\n😈=n (common letter in English)\n🐸=l (might be part of \"million\" or similar)\n🐶=i (common vowel)\n🥺=d (seems to fit context)\n😴=v (guessing based on positions)\n🥳=y (common in word endings)\n🤫=u (vowel that fits context)\n🥶=j (likely part of \"June\")\n🤓=p (fits in position)\n🤧=k (guess based on context)\n😇=p (guess based on context)\n\nThis would make the sentence something like: \"At the great american bash on june 20, 2008, million revealed statute to become the inaugural divas champion.\"\n\nAnswer: 🥵=a,👽=t,🦊=h,🤑=e,🐵=r,🧐=m,🐰=g,🦁=b,👻=s,🐱=o,😈=n,🐸=l,🐶=i,🥺=d,😴=v,🥳=y,🤫=u,🥶=j,🤓=p,🤧=k,😇=p","Let's analyze the feedback from the previous guesses:\n\nFrom Guess 1:\n🥵=a (Correct)\n👽=t (Correct)\n🦊=h (Correct)\n🤑=e (Correct)\n🐱=i (Incorrect)\n😈=s (Incorrect)\n🐵=r (Correct)\n🧐=m (Correct)\n🐸=n (Incorrect)\n🐶=c (Incorrect)\n\nFrom Guess 2:\n🥵=a (Correct)\n👽=t (Correct)\n🦊=h (Correct)\n🤑=e (Correct)\n🐵=r (Correct)\n🧐=m (Correct)\n🐰=g (Correct)\n🦁=b (Correct)\n👻=s (Correct)\n🐱=o (Correct) - Corrected from previous guess\n😈=n (Correct) - Corrected from previous guess\n🐸=l (Incorrect) - Still incorrect\n🐶=i (Correct) - Corrected from previous guess\n🥺=d (Correct)\n😴=v (Incorrect)\n🥳=y (Incorrect)\n🤫=u (Correct)\n🥶=j (Correct)\n🤓=p (Incorrect)\n🤧=k (Incorrect)\n😇=p (Correct)\n\nFrom these, we know the following emojis and their corresponding letters:\n🥵=a\n👽=t\n🦊=h\n🤑=e\n🐵=r\n🧐=m\n🐰=g\n🦁=b\n👻=s\n🐱=o\n😈=n\n🐶=i\n🥺=d\n🤫=u\n🥶=j\n😇=p\n\nThe emojis that are still incorrect or unknown:\n🐸 (was guessed as 'l' but incorrect)\n😴 (was guessed as 'v' but incorrect)\n🥳 (was guessed as 'y' but incorrect)\n🤓 (was guessed as 'p' but incorrect)\n🤧 (was guessed as 'k' but incorrect)\n\nNow, let's look at the encoded sentence with the known letters:\n🥵👽 👽🦊🤑 🐰🐵🤑🥵👽 🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈 🦁🥵👻🦊 🐱😈 🥶🤫🥳🤓 20, 2008, 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳 🥺🤑😴🤑🥵👽🤑🥺 😈🥵👽🥵🥳🤓🥵 👽🐱 🦁🤑🐸🐱🧐🤑 👽🦊🤑 🐶😈🥵🤫🐰🤫🐵🥵🥳 🥺🐶🤧🥵👻 🐸🦊🥵🧐😇🐶🐱😈.\n\nWith our known letters:\nat the great american bash on ju?p 20, 2008, m??oo? defeated nata?pa to be?ome the inaugural di?as? ?hampio?n.\n\nLet's try to fill in the missing letters:\n\nat the great american bash on july 20, 2008, m??oo? defeated nata?pa to be?ome the inaugural di?as? ?hampion.\n\nLet's consider some of the still unknown emojis:\n🥳 was guessed as 'y' but is incorrect. In \"ju?p\", the missing letter could be 'l', making it \"julp\", but that doesn't seem right. It's more likely \"july\". So 🥳 might be 'l'.\n\n🤓 was guessed as 'p' but is incorrect. In \"jul?\", the missing letter is likely 'y'. So 🤓 might be 'y'.\n\n🐸 was guessed as 'l' but is incorrect. It appears in \"m??oo?\" and \"?hampio?n\". If 🥳 is 'l', then 🐸 could be 'c', 'k', 'f', etc. Looking at \"m??oo?\", it could be \"mccool\", \"mckool\", etc. And \"?hampion\" would be \"champion\".\n\nSo, 🐸 might be 'c'.\n\nNow, the sentence becomes:\nat the great american bash on july 20, 2008, mccool defeated natacpa to become the inaugural dicas? champion.\n\nThis makes sense for most parts, but there are still some unclear words:\n- \"mccool\" is a plausible name, so 🐸 = 'c' seems reasonable.\n- \"natacpa\" doesn't seem right. If 😴 is 'l', it would be \"natalpa\".\n- \"dicas?\" is still unclear.\n\nLet's continue refining:\nIf 😴 is 'l', then the sentence becomes:\nat the great american bash on july 20, 2008, mccool defeated natalpa to become the inaugural dilas? champion.\n\nLet's check if we can infer the letter for 🤧:\nIn \"dilas?\", the missing letter could be 'h', making it \"dilash\", but that doesn't seem like a common word. It could also be 'c', making it \"dilasc\", which also doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, let's take a step back. Instead of trying to guess individual letters, let's look at the whole sentence to see if we can infer the context.\n\nThe sentence seems to be about a wrestling or sports event called \"Great American Bash\" which took place on July 20, 2008. It mentions that someone defeated someone else to become a champion.\n\nWith that context, let's reconsider:\n- \"mccool\" is likely Michelle McCool, a former WWE wrestler.\n- \"natalpa\" might be a corruption of \"Natalya\", another WWE wrestler.\n- \"dilas?\" might be \"Divas\", referring to the WWE Divas Championship.\n\nSo, with these guesses:\n🐸 = 'c' (for \"McCool\" and \"champion\")\n🥳 = 'l' (for \"July\")\n🤓 = 'y' (for \"July\")\n😴 = 'l' (for \"Natalya\")\n🤧 = 'h' (for \"Divas\")\n\nLet's reconsider the sentence with these guesses:\nat the great american bash on july 20, 2008, mccool defeated natalya to become the inaugural divas champion.\n\nThis sentence makes perfect sense in the context of WWE wrestling. Michelle McCool did indeed become the inaugural WWE Divas Champion by defeating Natalya on July 20, 2008, at the Great American Bash.\n\nLet's verify with the sentence:\n🥵👽 👽🦊🤑 🐰🐵🤑🥵👽 🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈 🦁🥵👻🦊 🐱😈 🥶🤫🥳🤓 20, 2008, 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳 🥺🤑😴🤑🥵👽🤑🥺 😈🥵👽🥵🥳🤓🥵 👽🐱 🦁🤑🐸🐱🧐🤑 👽🦊🤑 🐶😈🥵🤫🐰🤫🐵🥵🥳 🥺🐶🤧🥵👻 🐸🦊🥵🧐😇🐶🐱😈.\n\nWith our guesses:\nat the great american bash on july 20, 2008, mccool defeated natalya to become the inaugural divas champion.\n\nThis seems to fit perfectly. So our updated map is:\n🥵=a\n👽=t\n🦊=h\n🤑=e\n🐵=r\n🧐=m\n🐰=g\n🦁=b\n👻=s\n🐱=o\n😈=n\n🐶=i\n🥺=d\n🤫=u\n🥶=j\n😇=p\n🐸=c\n🥳=l\n🤓=y\n😴=l (this seems redundant, as 🥳 is also 'l')\n🤧=v\n\nLet's check if there are any redundancies or inconsistencies in our mapping.\n\nOne issue is that we've assigned 'l' to both 🥳 and 😴. Let's reexamine the sentence to see if one of them might be a different letter:\n\nat the great american bash on july 20, 2008, mccool defeated natalya to become the inaugural divas champion.\n\nIn this sentence:\n- 🥳 appears in \"july\", \"mccool\", and \"inaugural\"\n- 😴 appears in \"defeated\"\n\nIf 🥳 is 'l', then \"july\", \"mccool\", and \"inaugural\" make sense.\nIf 😴 is 'l', then \"defeated\" becomes \"deleated\", which doesn't seem right.\n\nLet's reconsider \"defeated\" with the known letters:\n🥺🤑😴🤑🥵👽🤑🥺 = d e ? e a t e d\n\nWith the? representing 😴. The most likely letter is 'f', which would give \"defeated\". So, 😴 is probably 'f'.\n\nLet's also check \"natacya\", which is supposed to be \"natalya\":\n😈🥵👽🥵🥳🤓🥵 = n a t a ? y a\n\nWith the? representing 🥳. If 🥳 is 'l', then it would be \"natalya\", which makes sense.\n\nSo, here's our updated mapping:\n🥵=a\n👽=t\n🦊=h\n🤑=e\n🐵=r\n🧐=m\n🐰=g\n🦁=b\n👻=s\n🐱=o\n😈=n\n🐶=i\n🥺=d\n🤫=u\n🥶=j\n😇=p\n🐸=c\n🥳=l\n🤓=y\n😴=f\n🤧=v\n\nNow, let's check the entire sentence with this mapping:\nat the great american bash on july 20, 2008, mccool defeated natalya to become the inaugural divas champion.\n\nThis seems to make perfect sense.\n\nLet's do one final check of the emojis we've mapped:\n🥵=a (Confirmed correct in previous feedback)\n👽=t (Confirmed correct in previous feedback)\n🦊=h (Confirmed correct in previous feedback)\n🤑=e (Confirmed correct in previous feedback)\n🐵=r (Confirmed correct in previous feedback)\n🧐=m (Confirmed correct in previous feedback)\n🐰=g (Confirmed correct in previous feedback)\n🦁=b (Confirmed correct in previous feedback)\n👻=s (Confirmed correct in previous feedback)\n🐱=o (Confirmed correct in previous feedback)\n😈=n (Confirmed correct in previous feedback)\n🐶=i (Confirmed correct in previous feedback)\n🥺=d (Confirmed correct in previous feedback)\n🤫=u (Confirmed correct in previous feedback)\n🥶=j (Confirmed correct in previous feedback)\n😇=p (Confirmed correct in previous feedback)\n🐸=c (New guess, based on \"McCool\" and \"champion\")\n🥳=l (New guess, based on \"July\" and \"McCool\")\n🤓=y (New guess, based on \"July\")\n😴=f (New guess, based on \"defeated\")\n🤧=v (New guess, based on \"Divas\")\n\nWith all these, the final decoded sentence is:\n\"At the Great American Bash on July 20, 2008, McCool defeated Natalya to become the inaugural Divas Champion.\"\n\nThis sounds historically accurate and makes perfect sense. I believe these are the correct mappings.\n\nLet me give my answer in the required format:\n\n🥵=a,👽=t,🦊=h,🤑=e,🐵=r,🧐=m,🐰=g,🦁=b,👻=s,🐱=o,😈=n,🐶=i,🥺=d,🤫=u,🥶=j,😇=p,🐸=c,🥳=l,🤓=y,😴=f,🤧=vLooking at the feedback from previous guesses, I've identified several letters correctly, but some still need to be determined. Let me analyze the encoded sentence to make a new guess.\n\nFirst, let's look at what we know for certain:\n🥵=a, 👽=t, 🦊=h, 🤑=e, 🐵=r, 🧐=m, 🐰=g, 🦁=b, 👻=s, 🐱=o, 😈=n, 🐶=i, 🥺=d, 🤫=u, 🥶=j, 😇=p\n\nWith these substitutions, the sentence becomes:\n\"at the great american bash on ju?? 20, 2008, m??oo? defeated nata??a to be?ome the inaugural di?as? ?hampio?n.\"\n\nThis appears to be about a wrestling event. Looking at the context:\n\n- 🥳 was incorrectly guessed as \"y\" but appears in \"ju??\", likely forming \"july\"\n- 🤓 appears after 🥳 in \"ju??\", completing \"july\"\n- 🐸 appears in \"m??oo?\" and \"?hampio?n\" - likely \"c\" for \"McCool\" and \"champion\"\n- 😴 would be \"f\" in \"defeated\"\n- 🤧 would be \"v\" in \"divas\"\n\nThis gives us the sentence:\n\"At the Great American Bash on July 20, 2008, McCool defeated Natalya to become the inaugural Divas Champion.\"\n\nThis makes perfect historical sense as Michelle McCool did become the first WWE Divas Champion by defeating Natalya at the Great American Bash on that date.\n\nAnswer: 🥵=a,👽=t,🦊=h,🤑=e,🐵=r,🧐=m,🐰=g,🦁=b,👻=s,🐱=o,😈=n,🐸=c,🐶=i,🥺=d,😴=f,🥳=l,🤫=u,🥶=j,🤓=y,🤧=v,😇=p"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

I need to figure out what emoji corresponds to which letter to decode the message. \n\nI've been given one hint: 🤖 = e.\n\nLet's first count the frequency of each emoji in the encoded sentence:\n\n🦆 - appears 3 times\n👽 - appears 6 times\n🐧 - appears 2 times\n🤖 - appears 8 times (and we know this is 'e')\n🐦 - appears 6 times\n🐶 - appears 3 times\n😍 - appears 2 times\n😇 - appears 5 times\n🐵 - appears 4 times\n😱 - appears 5 times\n🤠 - appears 2 times\n🐸 - appears 4 times\n🐱 - appears 4 times\n🤮 - appears 5 times\n🐔 - appears 1 time\n🤓 - appears 3 times\n🥵 - appears 1 time\n🐷 - appears 2 times\n🐨 - appears 2 times\n🦉 - appears 3 times\n🐻 - appears 1 time\n🦁 - appears 1 time\n🐦 - appears 6 times (counted twice?)\n🙄 - appears 1 time\n\nNow let's think about common English letter frequencies. After 'e', the most common letters are typically 't', 'a', 'o', 'i', 'n', etc. Let's consider some patterns to help us decode.\n\nFirst, let's look at single-emoji words, which are likely to be 'a' or 'I':\n- 🐱🐦 - possibly \"at\", \"an\", \"it\", etc.\n- 😱🤮 - possibly \"to\", \"of\", \"in\", etc.\n- 🐷🐨 - possibly \"by\", \"on\", \"as\", etc.\n\nLet's also look at the number \"23\" followed by a month and year (2007). This seems to be a date. The word before that is likely \"on\".\n\nHmm, this looks like something about a significant event that happened on September 23, 2007, or maybe November 23, 2007, or even December 23, 2007.\n\nBut wait, there's a hint that we have 🤖 = e. Given this, let's try to find common English patterns involving 'e':\n\n1. \"the\" is a very common word, so let's look for three-letter words with 🤖 in them.\n2. \"be\", \"we\", \"me\" are common two-letter words with 'e'.\n3. Common English suffixes like \"-ed\", \"-er\", \"-es\" often have 'e' in them.\n\nIn the sentence, I see 🐱🐦. If 🐦 = 't', then this could be \"at\". Let's assume 🐦 = 't' for now.\n\nIf 🐦 = 't', then 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦 and 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸 both start with 't', which is reasonable for English words.\n\nIf I assume 🐱 = 'a', then 🐱🐦 would be \"at\", which is a common English word.\n\nLet me try to build on these assumptions. If 🐱 = 'a' and 🐦 = 't', then let's look for patterns like \"that\" or \"the\".\n\nGiven 🤖 = 'e', I can look for \"the\". If 🐦 = 't' and 🐱 = 'a', we'd need to find \"the\". I see 🐦🐶🤖 in the text, so possibly 🐶 = 'h'.\n\nIf 🐶 = 'h', then 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦 would start with \"th\", which is plausible.\n\nLet's continue with this line of thought: if 🐦 = 't', 🐶 = 'h', and 🤖 = 'e', we might expect to see \"the\" as a common word. I don't immediately see \"🐦🐶🤖\" as a standalone word, which is a bit unusual.\n\nHowever, I notice 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 at the beginning. If 🐦 = 't', this ends with 't', which could be the end of a word like \"what\", \"that\", \"about\", etc.\n\nSince I've been asked to make a guess based on the available information, I'll go with my tentative assignments:\n- 🤖 = e (given)\n- 🐦 = t (based on frequency and patterns)\n- 🐱 = a (based on the common word \"at\")\n- 🐶 = h (based on potential patterns)\n\nBut let me try to deduce more before finalizing:\n\nLooking at 😱🤮, if this is \"to\" or \"of\", then 😱 could be 't' or 'o', and 🤮 could be 'o' or 'f'. But I already assigned 🐦 = 't', so either my earlier assumption is wrong, or 😱 = 'o' and 🤮 = 'f'.\n\nIf 😱 = 'o', then 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦 would have 'o' in it.\n\nThis is a bit challenging without more context. Let me continue with the assignments:\n- 🤖 = e (given)\n- 🐦 = t (based on frequency and patterns)\n- 🐱 = a (based on the common word \"at\")\n- 🐶 = h (based on potential patterns)\n- 😱 = o (tentative, based on the potential word \"to\")\n- 🤮 = f (tentative, based on the potential word \"of\")\n\nLet's try to decode parts of the sentence with these assignments:\n\n\"🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦 🐱🐦 😱🤮 😱🐶🐦🐸😇😱🐧🐱😱🤮\"\n\nWith the assignments:\n\"? ? ? e t t h ? e ? ? o ? ? e ? t a t o f o h t ? ? o ? a o f\"\n\nThis doesn't seem to form clear words yet, so I might need to re-evaluate.\n\nLet me think of common patterns again. In English, \"th\" is a common bigram, so if 🐦 = 't', we'd expect to see 🐦🐶 frequently if 🐶 = 'h'.\n\nI'm seeing \"🐦🐶\" several times, which strengthens the possibility that 🐦 = 't' and 🐶 = 'h'.\n\nNow, looking at \"🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦\", if 🐦 = 't', 🐶 = 'h', and 🤖 = 'e', this word starts with \"the\", which is promising.\n\nLet's continue with:\n- 🤖 = e (given)\n- 🐦 = t (based on frequency and patterns)\n- 🐶 = h (based on common \"th\" bigram)\n- 😱 = o (tentative)\n- 🐱 = a (tentative)\n- 🤮 = f (tentative)\n\nNow let's look at \"👽\". It appears 6 times, which is quite frequent. Common frequent letters in English are 'a', 'i', 'n', 'o', 'r', 's'. Since I've tentatively assigned 🐱 = 'a' and 😱 = 'o', 👽 could be 'i', 'n', 'r', or 's'.\n\nLet me look at contexts where 👽 appears:\n- 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 (at the beginning)\n- 👽🤓🤮🤖🥵 (before 🤓🤮🤖🥵)\n- 👽🐶😍 (followed by 🐶😍)\n- 👽🤮 (followed by 🤮)\n- 👽🤮 (again)\n- 👽🤮 (again)\n\nIf 🐶 = 'h', then 👽🐶😍 would be \"?h?\". In English, \"sh\", \"ch\", \"th\", \"wh\" are common. But I've already assigned 🐦 = 't', so 👽 could be 's', 'c', or 'w'.\n\nLet's tentatively assign 👽 = 's':\n- 🤖 = e (given)\n- 🐦 = t (based on frequency and patterns)\n- 🐶 = h (based on common \"th\" bigram)\n- 😱 = o (tentative)\n- 🐱 = a (tentative)\n- 🤮 = f (tentative)\n- 👽 = s (tentative, based on \"sh\" pattern)\n\nLet's decode a bit more:\n\"🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦 🐱🐦 😱🤮 😱🐶🐦🐸😇😱🐧🐱😱🤮\"\n\nWith the assignments:\n\"? s ? e t t h ? e ? ? o ? ? e ? t a t o f o h t ? ? o ? a o f\"\n\nI'm starting to think about the possible words that can fit in here. \"🦆👽🐧🤖🐦\" ends with \"set\" if 🐧 = 'r', which isn't a common English word ending. Maybe 🦆 = 'a' for \"asset\"? But I've already assigned 🐱 = 'a'.\n\nLet me rethink this. I think I've been making too many assumptions without solid evidence. Let me go back to basics.\n\nWe know 🤖 = 'e'. In English, the most frequent letters after 'e' are typically 't', 'a', 'o', 'i', 'n', etc.\n\nGiven that 🐦 appears 6 times (one of the most frequent emojis), it's plausible that 🐦 = 't' or 🐦 = 'a'.\n\nLet's look for very short words or isolated emojis. I see:\n- 🐱🐦 (a two-letter word)\n- 😱🤮 (another two-letter word)\n- 🐷🐨 (another two-letter word)\n\nCommon two-letter words in English include \"to\", \"in\", \"it\", \"is\", \"at\", \"an\", \"on\", etc.\n\nIf 🤖 = 'e', we might look for words like \"be\", \"we\", \"me\", but I don't see a pattern that fits.\n\nGiven the limited information and the complexity of the puzzle, I'll make the following tentative assignments:\n- 🤖 = e (given)\n- 🐦 = t (based on frequency and the potential for common patterns)\n- 👽 = a (based on frequency and common patterns)\n- 😱 = o (based on potential two-letter word \"to\")\n- 🤮 = f (based on potential two-letter word \"of\")\n- 🐶 = h (based on common \"th\" bigram)\n- 🐸 = r (tentative)\n- 😇 = i (tentative)\n- 🐱 = s (tentative)\n\nLet me try to see if this makes sense with the given sentence:\n\n\"🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦 🐱🐦 😱🤮 😱🐶🐦🐸😇😱🐧🐱😱🤮\"\n\nWith the assignments:\n\"? a ? e t t h ? e i ? o i ? e r t s t o f o h t r i o ? s o f\"\n\nOk, so my guesses are still pretty tentative. Let me summarize what I'm most confident about based on the patterns I've seen.\n\n- 🤖 = e (given)\n- 🐦 = t (relatively confident, based on patterns and frequency)\n- 👽 = a (relatively confident, based on frequency)\n- 🐶 = h (relatively confident, based on patterns and the 'th' bigram)\n\nFor the other emojis, I'm less certain and would need more context or confirmation. But based on the information available, I'll submit the following as my guess:\n\n🤖 = e (given as a hint)\n🐦 = t\n👽 = a\n🐶 = h\n😱 = o\n🤮 = f\n🐸 = r\n😇 = i\n🐱 = s\n🐧 = n# Crypto Word Game: Round 1 Analysis\n\nLooking at the encoded sentence, I'll use frequency analysis and pattern recognition to make educated guesses about which emoji corresponds to which letter.\n\n## Initial Analysis:\n- I'm given that 🤖 = e\n- The most frequently occurring emojis are likely common English letters\n- I'll look for patterns like common word structures and letter combinations\n\n## Frequency Analysis:\n- 🤖 appears 8 times (confirmed as 'e')\n- 🐦 and 👽 both appear 6 times (likely 't' and 'a')\n- 😇, 😱, and 🤮 each appear 5 times (potentially 'i', 'o', 'n')\n- 🐵, 🐸, and 🐱 each appear 4 times (potentially 'r', 's', 'h')\n\n## Pattern Recognition:\n- Two-letter words like 🐱🐦 and 😱🤮 give clues (potentially \"at\", \"to\", \"of\")\n- The structure before \"2007\" suggests a date format\n- Common English patterns like \"the\" and \"and\" can help identify letters\n\n## My Best Guesses:\nBased on this analysis, I believe:\n- 🤖 = e (given)\n- 🐦 = t (high frequency and pattern position)\n- 👽 = a (patterns and frequency)\n- 😱 = o (appears in likely articles and prepositions)\n- 🐶 = h (often follows 't' - forming \"th\")\n- 😇 = i (common letter in English)\n- 🐸 = r (appears in positions suggesting 'r')\n- 🤮 = f (appears in contexts suggesting 'f')\n- 🦆 = s (position at beginning of words)\n- 🐧 = p (tentative position-based guess)\n- 🐱 = n (frequency and position)\n\nAnswer: 🤖=e,🐦=t,👽=a,😱=o,🐶=h,😇=i,🐸=r,🤮=f,🦆=s,🐧=p,🐱=n","Let's analyze what I know so far:\n\nThe hint says 🤖=e, which is confirmed as correct from the feedback.\n\nFrom my first guess, all other letters were incorrect:\n- 🐦≠t\n- 👽≠a\n- 😱≠o\n- 🐶≠h\n- 😇≠i\n- 🐸≠r\n- 🤮≠f\n- 🦆≠s\n- 🐧≠p\n- 🐱≠n\n\nNow I need to make a new guess. Let me first analyze the encoded sentence to understand patterns and frequencies:\n\n```\n🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦 🐱🐦 😱🤮 😱🐶🐦🐸😇😱🐧🐱😱🤮 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸 🦆🐔😱🐱🤮 👽🤓🤮🤖🥵 🐷🐨 🤓🤖🐦🦉😱😇🐵🤖😇🐦 (🦉👽😇🐵🤖😇🐧🐨 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 🐻😇👽🐶😍 🐷🤖🦉👽😇🤖 🐱🐸🐦 😱🦆🦁🐶🐱🐦🐱🐸🐱👽🤮 👽🤮 23 🤮👽🙄🤖🐵🐷🤖😇 2007).\n```\n\nI see 🤖 appears many times, which makes sense as 'e' is often the most common letter in English.\n\nOther frequently occurring emojis include:\n- 🐦 (which isn't 't')\n- 👽\n- 😱\n- 🐶\n- 😇\n\nLet me try another common letter approach. Since I know 🤖=e, and based on the pattern, let me make an educated guess with common letters that follow frequency patterns in English.\n\nGiven that 🐦 appears frequently but isn't 't', it might be another common letter like 'a' or 'o'.\nSimilarly, for other frequent emoji, I'll guess common letters.\n\nFor this attempt, I'll try:\n- 🤖=e (confirmed correct)\n- 🐦=a\n- 👽=t\n- 😱=i\n- 🐶=n\n- 😇=s\n- 🐸=o\n- 🤮=l\n- 🦆=c\n- 🐧=h\n- 🐱=m\n- 🤠=d\n- 🐵=c\n- 😍=m\n- 🦉=u\n- 🐔=w\n- 🤓=r\n- 🥵=y\n- 🐷=b\n- 🐨=k\n- 🐻=p\n- 🦁=v\n- 👾=g\n\nWait, I think I made an error and repeated 'c' for both 🦆 and 🐵. Let me adjust:\n- 🐵=l (change)\n\nWait, I also assigned 'l' twice. Let me adjust again:\n- 🤮=f\n\nLet me organize and review my guesses:\n- 🤖=e (confirmed)\n- 🐦=a\n- 👽=t\n- 😱=i\n- 🐶=n\n- 😇=s\n- 🐸=o\n- 🤮=f\n- 🦆=c\n- 🐧=h\n- 🐱=m\n- 🤠=d\n- 🐵=l\n- 😍=m\n- 🦉=u\n- 🐔=w\n- 🤓=r\n- 🥵=y\n- 🐷=b\n- 🐨=k\n- 🐻=p\n- 🦁=v\n- 👾=g\n\nI see I have 'm' twice as well. Let me fix that:\n- 😍=g\n\nFinal check:\n- 🤖=e (confirmed)\n- 🐦=a\n- 👽=t\n- 😱=i\n- 🐶=n\n- 😇=s\n- 🐸=o\n- 🤮=f\n- 🦆=c\n- 🐧=h\n- 🐱=m\n- 🤠=d\n- 🐵=l\n- 😍=g\n- 🦉=u\n- 🐔=w\n- 🤓=r\n- 🥵=y\n- 🐷=b\n- 🐨=k\n- 🐻=p\n- 🦁=v\n- 🙄=p\n\nOops, I assigned 'p' twice. Let me fix:\n- 🙄=j\n\nI still haven't accounted for all emojis in the text. Let me check:\n- 🦁=v\n- 🤮=f\n- 🤠=d\n- 🐻=p\n\nLooking at the text again, I feel I might have missed some characters or made some duplicate assignments. Let me do a thorough check:\n\nEmojis from text: 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦 🐱🐦 😱🤮 😱🐶🐦🐸😇😱🐧🐱😱🤮 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸 🦆🐔😱🐱🤮 👽🤓🤮🤖🥵 🐷🐨 🤓🤖🐦🦉😱😇🐵🤖😇🐦 (🦉👽😇🐵🤖😇🐧🐨 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 🐻😇👽🐶😍 🐷🤖🦉👽😇🤖 🐱🐸🐦 😱🦆🦁🐶🐱🐦🐱🐸🐱👽🤮 👽🤮 23 🤮👽🙄🤖🐵🐷🤖😇 2007).\n\nMy assignments:\n- 🤖=e (confirmed)\n- 🐦=a\n- 👽=t\n- 😱=i\n- 🐶=n\n- 😇=s\n- 🐸=o\n- 🤮=f\n- 🦆=c\n- 🐧=h\n- 🐱=m\n- 🤠=d\n- 🐵=l\n- 😍=g\n- 🦉=u\n- 🐔=w\n- 🤓=r\n- 🥵=y\n- 🐷=b\n- 🐨=k\n- 🐻=p\n- 🦁=v\n- 🙄=j\n\nOk, I think I have covered most of the emojis. Let me finalize my guess:\n\nAnswer: 🤖=e, 🐦=a, 👽=t, 😱=i, 🐶=n, 😇=s, 🐸=o, 🤮=f, 🦆=c, 🐧=h, 🐱=m, 🤠=d, 🐵=l, 😍=g, 🦉=u, 🐔=w, 🤓=r, 🥵=y, 🐷=b, 🐨=k, 🐻=p, 🦁=v, 🙄=jLooking at the encoded sentence, I notice that I need to make a new guess since all my previous guesses except for 🤖=e were incorrect.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the frequency and positions of the emojis:\n\nThe sentence has a structure that suggests a formal text, possibly about some event (noting the date \"23 ... 2007\" at the end).\n\nSince 🤖=e is confirmed, I'll use that as my anchor point and make educated guesses based on common letter patterns in English:\n\n- 🐦 appears frequently and often near 🤖 (e), so it might be 's' or 'r'\n- 👽 appears multiple times, possibly 'a' or 't'\n- 😱 appears in clusters, could be 'i' or 'o'\n- 🐶 might be 'h' or 't' based on positioning\n- 😇 could be 'n' or 'r'\n- 🐸 often follows 🤖 (e), suggesting 'r' or 'd'\n- 🤮 appears less frequently, possibly 'u' or 'c'\n\nFor this round, I'll make the following guesses:\n\n🤖=e (confirmed)\n🐦=s\n👽=a\n😱=i\n🐶=t\n😇=r\n🐸=n\n🤮=u\n🦆=c\n🐧=p\n🐱=d\n🤠=l\n🐵=o\n😍=m\n🦉=g\n🐔=w\n🤓=f\n🥵=y\n🐷=b\n🐨=k\n🐻=j\n🦁=v\n🙄=x\n\nAnswer: 🤖=e,🐦=s,👽=a,😱=i,🐶=t,😇=r,🐸=n,🤮=u,🦆=c,🐧=p,🐱=d","HTTPError 529: {\"error\":{\"message\":\"-4316: Overloaded\",\"code\":\"-4307\"}}","Let's analyze the encoded sentence and the feedback from the first two guesses.\n\nFrom the feedback, we know that:\n- 🤖=e\n- 🐦=s (corrected in second guess)\n- 😇=r (corrected in second guess)\n- 🦆=c (corrected in second guess)\n\nThese are correct. Let's work with this knowledge and try to decode the rest.\n\nThe encoded sentence is:\n🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦 🐱🐦 😱🤮 😱🐶🐦🐸😇😱🐧🐱😱🤮 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸 🦆🐔😱🐱🤮 👽🤓🤮🤖🥵 🐷🐨 🤓🤖🐦🦉😱😇🐵🤖😇🐦 (🦉👽😇🐵🤖😇🐧🐨 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 🐻😇👽🐶😍 🐷🤖🦉👽😇🤖 🐱🐸🐦 😱🦁🦝🐶🐱🐦🐸🐱👽🤮 👽🤮 23 🤮👽🙄🤖🐵🐷🤖😇 2007).\n\nWith the confirmed letters:\nc👽🐧es s🐶😍er😇🐵😱r🤠e🐸s 🐱s 😱🤮 😱🐶s🐸r😱🐧🐱😱🤮 s🐶😍er😇🐵😱r🤠e🐸 c🐔😱🐱🤮 👽🤓🤮e🥵 🐷🐨 🤓es🦉😱r😇🐵er s (🦉👽r😇🐵er🐧🐨 c👽🐧es 🐻r👽🐶😍 🐷e🦉👽re 🐱🐸s 😱🦁🦝🐶🐱s🐸🐱👽🤮 👽🤮 23 🤮👽🙄e🐵🐷er 2007).\n\nNow, let's try to identify more emojis based on common letter patterns in English:\n\n1. Since we know '🤖' is 'e', which is the most common letter in English, I'll look for more patterns.\n2. 'th' is a common bigram, so let's check for patterns. \n3. Common short words like 'a', 'the', 'is', 'of', 'in', 'and', etc. might help us.\n\nLooking at the confirmed letters in the sentence again, I notice:\n- The pattern \"s🐶\" appears multiple times, which might be \"th\" in words like \"the\" or \"that\".\n- '😱' appears multiple times, and in English, common vowels include 'o' and 'a'.\n- Considering the previous guesses, '🐶' was guessed as 'h' and then 't'. Since 's🐶' could be 'st', let's try '🐶=t'.\n\nThe word \"🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦\" has confirmed 's' at the beginning and contains 'er' in the middle, so this might be \"st...er...s\". Words like \"structures\", \"streamers\", \"stragglers\" could fit.\n\n\"🦆🐔😱🐱🤮\" starts with 'c', so this might be \"ch...\", \"co...\", or \"ca...\".\n\n\"🐷🐨\" is a short word, maybe \"by\", \"to\", \"in\", etc.\n\n\"🦉👽😇🐵🤖😇🐧🐨\" has 'r' in the middle, so this might be \"...r...\".\n\nLet's update our guesses:\n- 🤖=e (confirmed)\n- 🐦=s (confirmed)\n- 😇=r (confirmed)\n- 🦆=c (confirmed)\n- 🐶=t \n- 👽=a\n- 😱=i\n- 🐸=n\n- 🤮=o\n- 🐧=p\n- 🐱=d\n- 🤠=g\n- 🐵=m\n- 😍=u\n- 🦉=l\n- 🐔=h\n- 🐷=b\n- 🐨=y\n- 🤓=v\n- 🥵=x\n- 🦝=j\n- 🦁=k\n- 🐻=w\n- 🙄=b (or another letter not yet assigned)\n\nLet's check if this makes the sentence readable:\n\ncases stuermiregns ds io itstripdiof stuermiregn chidf avex by veslirgrs (largripy capes wrahm belre dns ikjltsdiao af 23 oabember 2007).\n\nThis doesn't look right yet. Let's reconsider our guesses.\n\nI think we need to refine our approach. Let's focus on short words to get more context.\n\nWords like \"🐱🐦\" could be \"is\", \"as\", \"on\", \"in\", etc.\n\nSince the feedback for guess 2 indicates that 🐱 (guessed as 'd') is incorrect, let's try guessing 🐱=i.\n\nHowever, we already have 😱=i in our guess, so there might be some inconsistency.\n\nLet's look at the history of the guesses and feedback to ensure we have the correct understanding:\n\n1. Guess: 🤖=e,🐦=t,👽=a,😱=o,🐶=h,😇=i,🐸=r,🤮=f,🦆=s,🐧=p,🐱=n\n   Feedback: {'🤖': True, '🐦': False, '👽': False, '😱': False, '🐶': False, '😇': False, '🐸': False, '🤮': False, '🦆': False, '🐧': False, '🐱': False}\n\n2. Guess: 🤖=e,🐦=s,👽=a,😱=i,🐶=t,😇=r,🐸=n,🤮=u,🦆=c,🐧=p,🐱=d\n   Feedback: {'🤖': True, '🐦': True, '👽': False, '😱': False, '🐶': False, '😇': True, '🐸': False, '🤮': False, '🦆': True, '🐧': False, '🐱': False}\n\nSo from the feedback, we have confirmed:\n- 🤖=e\n- 🐦=s\n- 😇=r\n- 🦆=c\n\nAll other guesses are incorrect. \n\nLet's re-examine the encoded sentence with the confirmed letters:\n🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦 🐱🐦 😱🤮 😱🐶🐦🐸😇😱🐧🐱😱🤮 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸 🦆🐔😱🐱🤮 👽🤓🤮🤖🥵 🐷🐨 🤓🤖🐦🦉😱😇🐵🤖😇🐦 (🦉👽😇🐵🤖😇🐧🐨 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 🐻😇👽🐶😍 🐷🤖🦉👽😇🤖 🐱🐸🐦 😱🦁🦝🐶🐱🐦🐸🐱👽🤮 👽🤮 23 🤮👽🙄🤖🐵🐷🤖😇 2007).\n\nWith confirmed letters:\nc👽🐧es s🐶😍er🐵😱r🤠e🐸s 🐱s 😱🤮 😱🐶s🐸r😱🐧🐱😱🤮 s🐶😍er🐵😱r🤠e🐸 c🐔😱🐱🤮 👽🤓🤮e🥵 🐷🐨 🤓es🦉😱r🐵ers (🦉👽r🐵er🐧🐨 c👽🐧es 🐻r👽🐶😍 🐷e🦉👽re 🐱🐸s 😱🦁🦝🐶🐱s🐸🐱👽🤮 👽🤮 23 🤮👽🙄e🐵🐷er 2007).\n\nLet's try to identify common English words or patterns:\n\nThe word \"🐱🐦\" appears and could be \"as\", \"is\", or another short word.\n\n\"😱🤮\" is a short word, might be \"to\", \"in\", or another preposition.\n\n\"🐷🐨\" is another short word.\n\nLet's have a new guess:\n- 🤖=e (confirmed)\n- 🐦=s (confirmed)\n- 😇=r (confirmed)\n- 🦆=c (confirmed)\n- 🐶=h\n- 👽=a\n- 😱=o\n- 🐸=n\n- 🤮=f\n- 🐱=i\n- 🐧=p\n- 🤠=g\n- 🐵=m\n- 😍=u\n- 🦉=l\n- 🐔=h (duplicate with 🐶, should reconsider)\n- 🐷=b\n- 🐨=y\n- 🤓=v\n- 🥵=t\n- 🐔=h\n- 🦝=q\n- 🦁=j\n- 🐻=w\n- 🙄=b (or another letter not yet assigned)\n\nLet me rethink this. Let's focus on the first word:\n🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 = c👽🐧es\n\nCommon 5-letter words that match this pattern include \"cases\", \"capes\", or \"cares\".\n\nSince \"c👽pes\" or \"c👽res\" might be more likely, let's guess 👽=a.\n\nThe second word is:\n🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦 = s🐶😍er🐵😱r🤠e🐸s\n\nThis word is quite long and has \"er\" in the middle.\n\nLet's try to guess more letters:\n- 🤖=e (confirmed)\n- 🐦=s (confirmed)\n- 😇=r (confirmed)\n- 🦆=c (confirmed)\n- 👽=a\n- 🐶=t\n- 😱=o\n- 🐸=n\n- 🤮=f\n- 🐱=i\n- 🤠=g\n- 🐵=m\n- 😍=u\n\nWith these guesses:\ncases sturmorogns is of otsnopiof sturmorgn chiof avfe🥵 by veslormer s (larmerpy capes 🐻ra🐶m before ins o🦁q🐶isn🐱a🤮 a🤮 23 🤮a🙄ember 2007).\n\nThis still doesn't look right. Let me refine this approach.\n\nLet's analyze the word \"🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦\" more carefully:\n- We know it starts with 's' and contains 'er'.\n- Given its length, it could be a compound word or a word with suffixes.\n\nThe sequence \"🤖😇\" is 'er', so the word has the structure \"s🐶😍er🐵😱r🤠e🐸s\".\n\nIf we guess:\n- 🐶=t\n- 😍=u\n- 🐵=c\n- 😱=o\n- 🤠=p\n- 🐸=n\n\nThis gives us \"sturcorpens\" which doesn't seem to be a valid English word. \n\nLet's reconsider the entire approach:\n\nMaybe this is a specific sentence, possibly a news headline or a book title. Let's try to make some informed guesses:\n\nThe structure \"🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦\" looks like \"Cases studies\" or \"Cases something\".\n\n\"😱🤮\" could be \"of\" or \"on\".\n\nLet's update our guesses:\n- 🤖=e (confirmed)\n- 🐦=s (confirmed)\n- 😇=r (confirmed)\n- 🦆=c (confirmed)\n- 👽=a\n- 🐧=p\n- 🐶=t\n- 😍=u\n- 🐵=d\n- 😱=o\n- 🐸=n\n- 🤮=f\n- 🤠=i (conflicts with 😇=r, so maybe 🤠=l)\n- 🐱=i\n\nWith these guesses, let's reexamine the encoded sentence.\n\nActually, I'm going to re-read the task description to make sure I'm understanding the game correctly.\n\nThe game is to guess the letter corresponding to each emoji in the encoded sentence. I have several attempts, each recorded in History. Based on the feedback for each emoji, I'll refine my guesses.\n\nFirst, I need to ensure I include the emoji provided as a hint (🤖=e) and any correctly guessed emoji from previous attempts.\n\nThe feedback for Guess 2 revealed that 🤖=e, 🐦=s, 😇=r, 🦆=c are correct.\n\nFor Guess 3, I'll start with these confirmed letters and try to decode the rest of the sentence.\n\nLet's see if we can identify words or patterns in the encoded sentence:\n\n🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦 🐱🐦 😱🤮 😱🐶🐦🐸😇😱🐧🐱😱🤮 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸 🦆🐔😱🐱🤮 👽🤓🤮🤖🥵 🐷🐨 🤓🤖🐦🦉😱😇🐵🤖😇🐦 (🦉👽😇🐵🤖😇🐧🐨 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 🐻😇👽🐶😍 🐷🤖🦉👽😇🤖 🐱🐸🐦 😱🦁🦝🐶🐱🐦🐸🐱👽🤮 👽🤮 23 🤮👽🙄🤖🐵🐷🤖😇 2007).\n\nWith confirmed letters:\nc👽🐧es s🐶😍er🐵😱r🤠e🐸s 🐱s 😱🤮 😱🐶s🐸r😱🐧🐱😱🤮 s🐶😍er🐵😱r🤠e🐸 c🐔😱🐱🤮 👽🤓🤮e🥵 🐷🐨 🤓es🦉😱r🐵ers (🦉👽r🐵er🐧🐨 c👽🐧es 🐻r👽🐶😍 🐷e🦉👽re 🐱🐸s 😱🦁🦝🐶🐱s🐸🐱👽🤮 👽🤮 23 🤮👽🙄e🐵🐷er 2007).\n\nLooking at the start of the sentence, the word \"🦆👽🐧🤖🐦\" (c👽🐧es) could be \"cases\" or \"capes\". The context of the sentence might help determine which one.\n\nThe longer word \"🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦\" (s🐶😍er🐵😱r🤠e🐸s) suggests some kind of article or document.\n\nLet's try the following combinations for Guess 3:\n- 🤖=e (confirmed)\n- 🐦=s (confirmed)\n- 😇=r (confirmed)\n- 🦆=c (confirmed)\n- 👽=a\n- 🐧=p\n- 🐶=t\n- 😍=u\n- 🐵=d\n- 😱=i\n- 🐸=n\n- 🤮=f\n- 🤠=o\n- 🐱=l\n\nThis gives us:\ncapes studiridens ls if itsnipiif studiriodn clif avfe🥵 by veslirders (lardirpy capes 🐻ra🐶m belare lns i🦁q🐶lsnla🤮 a🤮 23 🤮abember 2007).\n\nThis still doesn't look right. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet's look for small words or patterns that are common in English. For example, the word \"😱🤮\" appears twice in the encoded sentence. Common 2-letter words include \"to\", \"of\", \"in\", \"it\", etc.\n\nIf \"😱🤮\" is \"of\", then:\n- 😱=o\n- 🤮=f\n\nIf \"😱🤮\" is \"in\", then:\n- 😱=i\n- 🤮=n\n\nLet's try the assumption that \"😱🤮\" is \"of\", making 😱=o and 🤮=f:\ncases studormores ls of otsnopiof studoroden clof avfe🥵 by veslorders (lardorpy cases 🐻ra🐶m belare lns o🦁q🐶lsnlaf af 23 fabember 2007).\n\nThis looks closer to a sentence. Let's refine our guesses:\n- 🤖=e (confirmed)\n- 🐦=s (confirmed)\n- 😇=r (confirmed)\n- 🦆=c (confirmed)\n- 👽=a\n- 🐧=p\n- 🐶=t\n- 😍=u\n- 🐵=d\n- 😱=o\n- 🐸=n\n- 🤮=f\n- 🤠=i\n- 🐱=l\n- 🐔=h\n- 🤓=b\n- 🥵=y\n- 🐷=m\n- 🐨=o (conflicting with 😱=o, so maybe 🐨=p)\n- 🦉=c (conflicting with 🦆=c, so maybe 🦉=l)\n- 🦁=j\n- 🦝=q\n- 🐻=w\n- 🙄=v\n\nLet's revise our guesses. We have some conflicting assignments, so I need to reconsider. Given that 😱=o and 🐱=l, I should ensure no other emoji is assigned to these letters.\n\nActually, let's start fresh with our confirmed letters and make sensible guesses for the rest.\n\nConfirmed:\n- 🤖=e (confirmed)\n- 🐦=s (confirmed)\n- 😇=r (confirmed)\n- 🦆=c (confirmed)\n\nLet's guess:\n- 👽=a\n- 🐧=p\n- 🐶=t\n- 😍=u\n- 🐵=d\n- 😱=i\n- 🐸=n\n- 🤮=o\n- 🤠=m\n- 🐱=l\n- 🐔=h\n- 🤓=v\n- 🥵=x\n- 🐷=b\n- 🐨=y\n- 🦉=f\n- 🦁=k\n- 🦝=q\n- 🐻=w\n- 🙄=m (conflicts with 🤠=m, so maybe 🙄=g)\n\nGiven the number of distinct emojis, we're dealing with a large set of letters. It's challenging without more context. \n\nLet's approach this a bit differently.\n\nFirst, let's count the frequency of each emoji in the encoded sentence:\n- 🤖 (e): Appears 11 times\n- 🐦 (s): Appears 11 times\n- 👽 (a?): Appears 10 times\n- 😇 (r): Appears 7 times\n- 🐱 (l?): Appears 6 times\n- 😱 (i?): Appears 6 times\n- 🐶 (t?): Appears 5 times\n- 🐸 (n?): Appears 5 times\n- 🤮 (o?): Appears 5 times\n- 🐧 (p?): Appears 4 times\n- 🦆 (c): Appears 3 times\n- 🐵 (d?): Appears 3 times\n- 🦉 (f?): Appears 3 times\n- 🤠 (m?): Appears 2 times\n- 🐔 (h?): Appears 1 time\n- 🤓 (v?): Appears 2 times\n- 🥵 (x?): Appears 1 time\n- 🐷 (b?): Appears 2 times\n- 🐨 (y?): Appears 2 times\n- 🦁 (k?): Appears 1 time\n- 🦝 (q?): Appears 1 time\n- 🐻 (w?): Appears 1 time\n- 🙄 (g?): Appears 1 time\n\nThe frequencies are consistent with English: 'e' and 's' are among the most common letters, followed by 'a', 'r', etc.\n\nLet's try to construct the sentence with our most confident guesses:\n- 🤖=e\n- 🐦=s\n- 😇=r\n- 🦆=c\n- 👽=a\n- 🐶=t\n- 😱=i\n- 🐸=n\n- 🤮=o\n- 🤠=m\n- 🐵=d\n- 🐱=l\n- 🐧=p\n- 🤓=v\n- 🥵=x\n- 🐨=y\n- 🐷=b\n- 🦉=f\n- 🦁=k\n- 🦝=j\n- 🐻=w\n- 🙄=g\n- 🐔=h\n\nThis gives us:\ncapes stdermiregns ls io itsnripdiof stdermiregn chidf avxe by veslirmers (fardirpy capes wrath befare lns ikjltsndiao ao 23 oagember 2007).\n\nThis is still not fully coherent. Let me refine further.\n\nGiven the context, this could be a sentence about a specific event or topic from 2007. We have \"23\" and \"2007\" in the sentence, which suggests a specific date.\n\n\"🦆👽🐧🤖🐦\" as \"capes\" seems odd in the context. It might be \"cases\" instead, which would make 👽=a and 🐧=s. But 🐧 can't be 's' because 🐦 has been confirmed as 's'.\n\nIf \"🦆👽🐧🤖🐦\" is \"capes\", then the second word \"🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦\" would be \"stuermiregns\", which also doesn't make much sense.\n\nLet me rethink this.\n\nActually, I think I've been overthinking this. Let's go back to the clues we have and make sensible guesses.\n\nConfirmed:\n- 🤖=e\n- 🐦=s\n- 😇=r\n- 🦆=c\n\nFrequency in English: e, t, a, o, i, n, s, h, r, d, l, u, ...\n\nGiven that 's' and 'e' have been confirmed and are among the most frequent, 'a' and 't' should also be among the most frequent.\n\nFrom our frequency count, 👽 appears 10 times and 🐶 appears 5 times. So, a reasonable guess is 👽=a and 🐶=t.\n\nFor the other frequent emojis, 😱 and 🐱 both appear 6 times and 🐸 and 🤮 both appear 5 times. Reasonable guesses could be 😱=i or 😱=o, 🐱=n or 🐱=h, 🐸=o or 🐸=i or 🐸=n, and 🤮=l or 🤮=d.\n\nSince 😱 has already been guessed as 'i' and I'm not sure of its validity, let's stick with it for now. Then, 🐱 could be 'n', 🐸 could be 'o', and 🤮 could be 'd' or 'h'.\n\nExtending to a few more letters:\n- 🐵=m\n- 🤠=u or 🤠=g\n- 🐧=p\n- 🤓=v\n- 🦉=f\n- 🐔=h (if 🤮 isn't 'h')\n- 🐷=b\n- 🐨=y\n- 🥵=l (if 🐱 isn't 'l')\n- 🦁=k\n- 🦝=j\n- 🐻=w\n- 🙄=g (if 🤠 isn't 'g')\n\nOne more time, with some adjustments:\n- 🤖=e (confirmed)\n- 🐦=s (confirmed)\n- 😇=r (confirmed)\n- 🦆=c (confirmed)\n- 👽=a\n- 🐶=t\n- 😱=i\n- 🐸=o\n- 🤮=d\n- 🤠=g\n- 🐵=m\n- 🐱=n\n- 🐧=p\n- 🤓=v\n- 🦉=f\n- 🐔=h\n- 🐷=b\n- 🐨=y\n- 🥵=l\n- 🦁=k\n- 🦝=j\n- 🐻=w\n- 🙄=g (conflicts with 🤠=g, so maybe 🙄=v)\n\nHmm, there's a conflict with 🤓=v and 🙄=v.

Let me make one more adjustment.\n\nActually, when re-reading the sentence, the phrase \"befare nos ikjltsniad ad 23 dauember 2007\" suggests a date. If we interpret \"dauember\" as \"November\", then 🤮 should be 'o', not 'd'.\n\nLet's revise:\n- 🤖=e (confirmed)\n- 🐦=s (confirmed)\n- 😇=r (confirmed)\n- 🦆=c (confirmed)\n- 👽=a\n- 🐶=t\n- 😱=i\n- 🐸=n\n- 🤮=o\n- 🤠=g\n- 🐵=m\n- 🐱=l\n- 🐧=p\n- 🤓=v\n- 🦉=f\n- 🐔=h\n- 🐷=b\n- 🐨=y\n- 🥵=d\n- 🦁=k\n- 🦝=j\n- 🐻=w\n- 🙄=v (conflicts with 🤓=v, so maybe 🙄=c)\n\nHmm, 🙄=c conflicts with 🦆=c. \n\nAlright, let's make a final adjustment:\n- 🤖=e (confirmed)\n- 🐦=s (confirmed)\n- 😇=r (confirmed)\n- 🦆=c (confirmed)\n- 👽=a\n- 🐶=t\n- 😱=i\n- 🐸=n\n- 🤮=o\n- 🤠=g\n- 🐵=m\n- 🐱=l\n- 🐧=p\n- 🤓=v\n- 🦉=f\n- 🐔=h\n- 🐷=b\n- 🐨=y\n- 🥵=d\n- 🦁=k\n- 🦝=j\n- 🐻=w\n- 🙄=u\n\nThis gives:\ncapes stuermirgens ls io itsnripiof stuermirgen chiof avde🥵 by veslirmers (farmerip🐨 capes wrath befare lns i🦁jltsniao ao 23 oauember 2007).\n\nAlright, for Attempt 3, I'll go with:\n🤖=e, 🐦=s, 😇=r, 🦆=c, 👽=a, 🐶=t, 😱=i, 🐸=n, 🤮=o, 🤠=g, 🐵=m, 🐱=l, 🐧=p, 🤓=v, 🦉=f, 🐔=h, 🐷=b, 🐨=y, 🥵=d, 🦁=k, 🦝=j, 🐻=w, 🙄=uLooking at the encoded sentence and the feedback from the first two guesses, I'll analyze the patterns to make better guesses for this round.\n\nFrom the feedback, I know these assignments are correct:\n- 🤖=e\n- 🐦=s\n- 😇=r\n- 🦆=c\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the frequency of different emojis in the sentence:\n- 🤖 appears 11 times (confirmed as 'e')\n- 🐦 appears 11 times (confirmed as 's')\n- 👽 appears 10 times (possibly a common letter like 'a' or 'i')\n- 😱 appears 6 times\n- 🐱 appears 6 times\n- 🐶 appears 5 times\n\nLooking at the structure of the sentence, I notice:\n- Word \"🐱🐦\" could be \"is\" or \"as\"\n- \"😱🤮\" appears twice and might be a common preposition like \"of\" or \"in\"\n- The date reference at the end suggests \"23 🤮👽🙄🤖🐵🐷🤖😇 2007\" could be \"23 November 2007\"\n\nBased on common letter frequencies, word patterns, and context clues, here's my guess:\n\n🤖=e (confirmed)\n🐦=s (confirmed)\n😇=r (confirmed)\n🦆=c (confirmed)\n👽=a\n🐶=t\n😱=i\n🐸=n\n🤮=o\n🐱=l\n🐵=m\n🤠=g\n😍=u\n🐔=h\n🤓=v\n🐧=p\n🐷=b\n🐨=y\n🦉=f\n🥵=x\n🦁=k\n🦝=j\n🐻=w\n🙄=d\n\nThis would make the sentence read: \"cases superimregens ls io itsnripiol supermiregen chiol avxex by veslirmers (farmeripy capes wrath befare lns ikjltsniao ao 23 oadvember 2007).\"\n\nNot perfect yet, but getting closer to recognizable words and phrases.\n\nAnswer: 🤖=e,🐦=s,😇=r,🦆=c,👽=a,🐶=t,😱=i,🐸=n,🤮=o,🐱=l,🐵=m,🤠=g,😍=u,🐔=h,🤓=v,🐧=p,🐷=b,🐨=y,🦉=f,🥵=x,🦁=k,🦝=j,🐻=w,🙄=d","HTTPError 529: {\"error\":{\"message\":\"-4316: Overloaded\",\"code\":\"-4307\"}}","HTTPError 529: {\"error\":{\"message\":\"-4316: Overloaded\",\"code\":\"-4307\"}}","HTTPError 529: {\"error\":{\"message\":\"-4316: Overloaded\",\"code\":\"-4307\"}}","Let's analyze what we have from the previous guesses:\n\nCorrect:\n- 🤖=e (hint)\n- 🐦=s\n- 😇=r\n- 🦆=c\n- 🐵=m\n- 🐔=h\n- 🐷=b\n- 🐨=y\n- 🦉=f\n\nIncorrect:\n- 👽≠a\n- 🐶≠t, 🐶≠h\n- 😱≠o, 😱≠i\n- 🐸≠r, 🐸≠n\n- 🤮≠f, 🤮≠u, 🤮≠o\n- 🐱≠n, 🐱≠d, 🐱≠l\n- 🤠≠g\n- 😍≠u\n- 🤓≠v\n- 🐧≠p\n- 🥵≠x\n- 🦁≠k\n- 🦝≠j\n- 🐻≠w\n- 🙄≠d\n\nLet's rewrite the encoded sentence with the letters we know:\n\n🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦 🐱🐦 😱🤮 😱🐶🐦🐸😇😱🐧🐱😱🤮 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸 🦆🐔😱🐱🤮 👽🤓🤮🤖🥵 🐷🐨 🤓🤖🐦🦉😱😇🐵🤖😇🐦 (🦉👽😇🐵🤖😇🐧🐨 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 🐻😇👽🐶😍 🐷🤖🦉👽😇🤖 🐱🐸🐦 😱🦆🦁🐶🐱🐦🐱🐸🐱👽🤮 👽🤮 23 🤮👽🙄🤖🐵🐷🤖😇 2007).\n\nBecomes:\nc_es s__ermr_es _s __ __sr___ s__ermr_er ch__ ___e_ by _esfrmers (f_rm_ry c_es _r___ bef_re __s _c___s___ _s 23 s__ember 2007).\n\nNow, let's use patterns and common English words to fill in more letters.\n\nLooking at `c_es`, this could be \"CUES\" or \"CIES\" or similar.\n\n`s__ermr_es` appears twice and ends with \"es\". This could be a plural noun. Given that we have \"m\" and \"r\" in there, it might be \"supermarkets\" or something similar.\n\nLet's try to figure out more letters:\n\n- 👽 could be \"i\" or \"u\"\n- 🐶 could be \"p\" or \"d\"\n- 😍 might be \"p\"\n- 😱 could be \"a\" or \"o\"\n- 🤠 could be \"k\" or \"a\"\n- 🐸 might be \"k\"\n- 🐱 could be \"w\" or \"i\"\n- 🤮 might be \"o\"\n- 🐧 could be \"i\" or \"p\"\n- 🤓 might be \"a\" or \"l\"\n- 🥵 could be \"d\"\n- 🦁 might be \"t\"\n- 🐻 could be \"w\"\n- 🙄 might be \"t\" or \"v\"\n\nLet's try to make sense of the first few words:\nc_es s__ermr_es _s __ __sr___ s__ermr_er ch__\n\nIf the second word is \"supermarkets\", then 🐶 is likely \"p\", and 😍 is \"u\", and 🤠 is \"a\", and 🐸 is \"k\".\n\nThis would give us: c_es supermarkets _s __ _psr___ supermrker ch__\n\nIf we continue with that assumption, the sentence might be about a supermarket or supermarkets. The phrase \"before the acquisition as 23 September 2007\" suggests it's talking about a business acquisition.\n\nGiven this context, 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 might be \"CITES\" or \"COLES\" (a supermarket chain in Australia).\n\nActually, if 👽 is \"o\", then it could be \"COLES supermarkets is an Austrian supermarket chain owned by Wesfarmers (formerly Coles group before the acquisition as 23 September 2007).\"\n\nThis seems to make more sense. So let's try:\n- 👽=o\n- 🐶=p\n- 😍=u\n- 😱=a\n- 🤠=a (this seems redundant, so maybe it's \"k\")\n- 🐸=k\n- 🐱=t\n- 🤮=n\n- 🐧=l\n- 🤓=w\n- 🥵=d\n- 🦁=q\n- 🐻=g\n- 🙄=p (this seems redundant with 🐶, so maybe it's \"t\" or something else)\n\nRe-reading the sentence with these substitutions:\ncoles supermrakets ts an austraplan supermrker chant owned by wesfarmers (farmerly coles group before the acqutsttnon as 23 september 2007).\n\nHmm, there are still some issues. Let's refine:\n\nFor 🤠, if it's not \"a\" (since 😱 is \"a\"), it could be \"k\".\nFor 🐸, if it's not \"k\" (since 🤠 might be \"k\"), it could be \"t\".\nFor 🐱, if it's not \"t\" (since 🐸 might be \"t\"), it could be \"i\".\nFor 🙄, it could be \"p\" or \"v\".\n\nActually, it looks like there might be a typo or a mistake in the guesses. Let's reconsider.\n\nRe-mapping the sentence with the confirmed letters:\n\n🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦 🐱🐦 😱🤮 😱🐶🐦🐸😇😱🐧🐱😱🤮 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸 🦆🐔😱🐱🤮 👽🤓🤮🤖🥵 🐷🐨 🤓🤖🐦🦉😱😇🐵🤖😇🐦 (🦉👽😇🐵🤖😇🐧🐨 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 🐻😇👽🐶😍 🐷🤖🦉👽😇🤖 🐱🐸🐦 😱🦆🦁🐶🐱🐦🐱🐸🐱👽🤮 👽🤮 23 🤮👽🙄🤖🐵🐷🤖😇 2007).\n\nc_es s_perm_r_ets _s __ __str___ sperm_r_et ch__ ___e_ by _esf_rmers (f_rm_r_y c_es _r_p bef_re __s _c__s___ _s 23 s__ember 2007).\n\nI really think this is about Coles supermarkets, which is an Australian supermarket chain.\n\n- 👽=o\n- 🐶=u\n- 😍=p\n- 😱=a\n- 🤠=k\n- 🐸=t\n- 🐱=i\n- 🤮=l\n- 🐧=l\n- 🤓=w\n- 🥵=d\n- 🦁=q\n- 🐻=g\n- 🙄=t\n\nWith these substitutions:\ncoles supermrkets is al austrlial supermarket chaile owled by wesfarmers (formerly coles group before ths acquisitiole as 23 stember 2007).\n\nHmm, that's still not quite right. Let's adjust:\n\n- 👽=o\n- 🐶=u\n- 😍=p\n- 😱=a\n- 🤠=k\n- 🐸=t\n- 🐱=i\n- 🤮=n\n- 🐧=l\n- 🤓=w\n- 🥵=d\n- 🦁=i\n- 🐻=g\n- 🙄=p\n\nWith these substitutions:\ncoles supermarkets is an austrailan supermarket chain owned by wesfarmers (formerly coles group before the acquisition as 23 sepember 2007).\n\nThat looks better, but there might still be a few issues. For example, \"Australian\" is typically spelled with \"ia\" not \"ai\". Let's continue refining.\n\nLet's recheck the feedback:\nCorrect:\n- 🤖=e (hint)\n- 🐦=s\n- 😇=r\n- 🦆=c\n- 🐵=m\n- 🐔=h\n- 🐷=b\n- 🐨=y\n- 🦉=f\n\nIncorrect:\n- 👽≠a\n- 🐶≠t, 🐶≠h\n- 😱≠o, 😱≠i\n- 🐸≠r, 🐸≠n\n- 🤮≠f, 🤮≠u, 🤮≠o\n- 🐱≠n, 🐱≠d, 🐱≠l\n- 🤠≠g\n- 😍≠u\n- 🤓≠v\n- 🐧≠p\n- 🥵≠x\n- 🦁≠k\n- 🦝≠j\n- 🐻≠w\n- 🙄≠d\n\nI think 👽 is \"o\", but it was marked as incorrect when guessed as \"a\". So that's one.\n\nFor 🐶, it's not \"t\" or \"h\". Given the context, it could be \"u\" or \"p\".\nFor 😱, it's not \"o\" or \"i\". It could be \"a\".\nFor 🐸, it's not \"r\" or \"n\". It could be \"t\" or \"k\".\nFor 🤮, it's not \"f\", \"u\", or \"o\". It could be \"n\" or \"l\".\nFor 🐱, it's not \"n\", \"d\", or \"l\". It could be \"i\" or \"a\".\nFor 🤠, it's not \"g\". It could be \"k\" or \"a\".\nFor 😍, it's not \"u\". It could be \"p\".\nFor 🤓, it's not \"v\". It could be \"w\" or \"o\".\nFor 🐧, it's not \"p\". It could be \"l\" or \"a\".\nFor 🥵, it's not \"x\". It could be \"d\".\nFor 🦁, it's not \"k\". It could be \"q\" or \"i\".\nFor 🐻, it's not \"w\". It could be \"g\".\nFor 🙄, it's not \"d\". It could be \"p\" or \"t\".\n\nLet's try another approach.

Looking at word patterns and common English phrases, I can deduce:\n\n- 👽 appears in \"🦆👽🐧🤖🐦\" which is likely \"COLES\" → 👽=o\n- 🐶 appears in patterns suggesting \"u\" (as in \"supermarkets\")\n- 😍 likely represents \"p\" in \"supermarkets\"\n- 😱 appears in patterns suggesting \"a\"\n- 🤠 likely represents \"k\" in \"supermarkets\"\n- 🐸 appears in patterns suggesting \"t\"\n- 🐱 appears in patterns suggesting \"i\"\n- 🤮 appears in patterns suggesting \"n\"\n- 🐧 likely represents \"l\" in \"Coles\"\n- 🤓 appears in patterns suggesting \"w\"\n- 🥵 likely represents \"d\"\n- 🦁 likely represents \"q\" in \"acquisition\"\n- 🐻 likely represents \"g\" in \"group\"\n- 🙄 likely represents \"v\" in \"November\"\n\nWhen all these substitutions are applied, the sentence reads:\n\"Coles supermarkets is an Australian supermarket chain owned by Wesfarmers (formerly Coles group before its acquisition on 23 November 2007).\"\n\nThis makes perfect sense as a factual statement about the Coles supermarket chain.\n\nAnswer: 🤖=e,🐦=s,😇=r,🦆=c,🐵=m,🐔=h,🐷=b,🐨=y,🦉=f,👽=o,🐶=u,😍=p,😱=a,🤠=k,🐸=t,🐱=i,🤮=n,🐧=l,🤓=w,🥵=d,🦁=q,🐻=g,🙄=v"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Looking at the position of 'e's and word patterns:\n- The first word has 'e' as the 5th and 7th letter (🐹😇🐔🐔e🥺😴e🥶)\n- Words that have 'e' in them: first word, third word (twice), and fifth word.\n\n2. Common English patterns:\n- 'the' is a very common word and might appear as a three-letter word with 'e' at the end\n- Words ending with 'ed' are common\n\nLet's look at possible three-letter words in this sentence:\n- 🐵👽 (2nd to last word)\n- Maybe 🐵🥶😇 (part of the 2nd word)\n\nAlso, let's check if there's any potential \"the\":\n- There's no three-letter word ending with 'e' in this sentence.\n\nLet's think about commonly used letters in English: t, a, o, i, n, s, h, r, d, l\nLet's make some educated guesses:\n\nThe date \"1983\" suggests this might be about a historical event.\n\nLet's analyze word by word:\n1. 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 - This is a 9-letter word with 'e' in positions 5 and 7. Potential words could include \"different\", \"reference\", \"telephone\", etc.\n2. 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 - A 6-letter word.\n3. 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 - An 8-letter word with 'e' in positions 3 and 6.\n4. 🐵👽 - A 2-letter word. Common 2-letter words include \"in\", \"on\", \"at\", \"to\", \"of\", etc.\n5. 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 - A 6-letter word with 'e' in position 5.\n6. 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 - A 5-letter word.\n\nLet's try some guesses:\n\nFor the two-letter word 🐵👽, common options are \"to\", \"in\", \"on\", \"at\", \"it\", etc.\nIf 🐵👽 is \"in\" then 🐵=i and 👽=n.\n\nLet's see if this fits elsewhere:\n- 🐵 appears in words 2, 3, 4, and 6\n- 👽 appears in words 3, 4, and 5\n\nIf 🥶 is 'r', let's check:\n- 🥶 appears in words 1, 2, 3, and 5\n\nLet's start with these guesses:\n- 🥵=e (given)\n- 🐵=i\n- 👽=n\n- 🥶=r\n\nSubstituting:\n🐹😇🐔🐔e🥺😴er iner😇🤑🥺🐔 n🐹er😇ie🧐 in 🦆nr🐼e🐔 🤥🥺i🤑🤠 1983.\n\nThis doesn't look quite right. Let's try different guesses:\n\nWhat if 🐵👽 is \"of\"?\n- 🐵=o\n- 👽=f\n\nSubstituting:\n🐹😇🐔🐔e🥺😴er o🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 f🐹e🥶😇oe🧐 of 🦆f🥶🐼e🐔 🤥🥺o🤑🤠 1983.\n\nThis still doesn't seem right.\n\nWhat if 🐵👽 is \"to\"?\n- 🐵=t\n- 👽=o\n\nSubstituting:\n🐹😇🐔🐔e🥺😴er t🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 o🐹e🥶😇te🧐 to 🦆o🥶🐼e🐔 🤥🥺t🤑🤠 1983.\n\nLooking at the first word: 🐹😇🐔🐔e🥺😴er\nIf 🥶=r, it becomes 🐹😇🐔🐔e🥺😴er, which could be \"ch_lle_er\" or \"st_lle_er\".\n\"Challenger\" seems like a good possibility! So:\n- 🐹=c\n- 😇=h\n- 🐔=a\n- 🥺=n\n- 😴=g\n\nLet's substitute these:\nchallenger t🥶ana🐔 o🐹e🥶ate🧐 to 🦆o🥶🐼e🐔 🤥🥺t🤑🤠 1983.\n\nIf this is about the Challenger space shuttle, then the sentence might be about its operation or launch in 1983.\n\"challenger trana operate_ to _or_e_ _nt__ 1983.\"\n\nWait, there might be a mistake or I might have made some wrong assumptions. Let's reconsider.\n\nLet's start again with:\n- 🥵=e (given)\n- 🐔=a (common letter, appears multiple times)\n\nThe first word 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 could be \"challenger\" if:\n- 🐹=c\n- 😇=h\n- 🐔=a\n- 🥵=e\n- 🥺=n\n- 😴=g\n- 🥶=r\n\nSubstituting:\nchallenger 🐵nha🐔 o🐹era🐵e🧐 🐵o 🦆or🐼e🐔 🤥n🐵🤑🤠 1983.\n\nThe third word o🐹era🐵e🧐 could be \"operated\" if:\n- 👽=o\n- 🐹=p (but this conflicts with my earlier guess of 🐹=c)\n- 🧐=d\n\nI think I need to reconsider some assumptions.\n\nLet's look at the pattern again:\n🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 🐵👽 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 1983.\n\nThis looks like a sentence with 6 words (before the date).\nWord lengths: 9, 6, 8, 2, 6, 5\n\nIf the first word is \"computer\" or \"software\", which are technology-related terms:\n- \"computer\" (8 letters) doesn't match\n- \"software\" (8 letters) doesn't match\n\nMaybe the first word is \"internet\"? (8 letters, doesn't match)\n\nConsidering historical events in 1983 related to technology:\n- The Internet's TCP\/IP protocol was standardized in 1983\n- The first mobile phones were introduced in 1983\n- Several notable computer models were released\n\nLet's try another approach. If the last word is \"since\", it would be 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 = s🥺🐵🤑e.\nIf 🥺=i, 🐵=n, 🤑=c, 🤠=e, then the word would be \"since\".\n\nLet me re-substitute with:\n- 🥵=e (given)\n- 🥺=i\n- 🐵=n\n- 🤑=c\n- 🤠=e\n\nThe encoded sentence becomes:\n🐹h🐔🐔eni😴e🥶 n🥶h🤑i🐔 o🐹e🥶🐵ne🧐 no 🦆o🥶🐼e🐔 🤥ince 1983.\n\nThis still doesn't make complete sense.\n\nLet's try a different approach. The second word 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 might be \"brand\" or \"trade\" or \"world\".\nIf it's \"brand\":\n- 🐵=b\n- 🥶=r\n- 😇=a\n- 🤑=n\n- 🥺=d\n- 🐔=s\n\nIf it's \"trade\":\n- 🐵=t\n- 🥶=r\n- 😇=a\n- 🤑=d\n- 🥺=e (this conflicts with 🥵=e)\n\nIf it's \"world\":\n- 🐵=w\n- 🥶=o\n- 😇=r\n- 🤑=l\n- 🥺=d\n- 🐔=s or 🐔= (this doesn't make sense)\n\nNone of these seem to fit perfectly.\n\nLet's consider another perspective. The first word 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 has 'e' in positions 5 and 7. Words with this pattern include \"internet\", \"wireless\", \"commerce\", etc.\n\nIf it's \"wireless\":\n- 🐹=w\n- 😇=i\n- 🐔=r\n- 🐔=e (conflicts with 🥵=e)\n- 🥵=l\n- 🥺=e (conflicts with 🥵=e)\n- 😴=s\n- 🥵=s (conflicts with 🥵=e and 😴=s)\n\nThis doesn't work.\n\nLet's take a step back and look at word patterns again. The fourth word 🐵👽 is a two-letter word. Common two-letter words include \"in\", \"on\", \"at\", \"to\", \"of\".\n\nIf it's \"in\":\n- 🐵=i\n- 👽=n\n\nIf it's \"to\":\n- 🐵=t\n- 👽=o\n\nLet's try with \"to\":\n- 🐵=t\n- 👽=o\n\nSubstituting:\n🐹😇🐔🐔e🥺😴e🥶 t🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 o🐹e🥶😇te🧐 to 🦆o🥶🐼e🐔 🤥🥺t🤑🤠 1983.\n\nLet's guess some more based on probabilities and patterns:\n\nIf 🥶=r, the first word becomes 🐹😇🐔🐔e🥺😴er, which could be \"challenger\" or \"passenger\" or similar.\n\nIf the first word is \"challenger\":\n- 🐹=c\n- 😇=h\n- 🐔=a\n- 🥵=e (given)\n- 🥺=l\n- 😴=g\n- 🥶=r\n\nThe second word would be tr😇🤑🥺🐔 which could be \"train\" or \"trail\".\n\nIf it's \"train\":\n- 😇=a\n- 🤑=i (conflicts with my guess of 🥺=i)\n- 🥺=n\n\nHmm, there are still conflicts. Let me rethink.\n\nActually, looking at the pattern again, I think the first word might be \"challenger\" and the sentence might be about the Challenger space shuttle. The last word 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 could be \"since\".\n\nLet's try again with:\n- 🥵=e (given)\n- 🐹=c\n- 😇=h\n- 🐔=a\n- 🥺=l\n- 😴=g\n- 🥶=r\n- 🐵=n\n- 👽=o\n- 🤑=c\n- 🤠=e\n\nSubstituting:\nchallenger 🐵ra🤑l 🐔 orera🐵e🧐 🐵o 🦆or🐼e🐔 🤥lnce 1983.\n\nThis still has some inconsistencies.\n\nLet me try one more approach. If the first word is \"computer\":\n- 🐹=c\n- 😇=o\n- 🐔=m\n- 🥵=p\n- 🥺=u\n- 😴=t\n- 🥵=e (given)\n- 🥶=r\n\nBut this doesn't work because 🥵 is repeated and should only represent 'e'.\n\nI'm still having trouble decoding this without more context. Let me take another approach by considering the structure of the sentence.\n\nIn the encoded sentence:\n🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 🐵👽 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 1983.\n\nIf I assume it's about the Challenger space shuttle and the fourth word is \"to\", the fifth word might be \"space\" or \"earth\" or \"orbit\".\n\nLet's try with:\n- 🥵=e (given)\n- 🐹=c\n- 😇=h\n- 🐔=a\n- 🥺=l\n- 😴=g\n- 🥶=r\n- 🐵=t\n- 👽=o\n- 🦆=s\n- 🐼=p\n- 🤥=s (duplicate of 🦆=s?)\n- 🤑=i\n- 🤠=e (duplicate of 🥵=e?)\n\nAlright, let's rationalize this a bit more. \n\nThe first word might be \"challenger\", the space shuttle.\nThe fourth word could be \"to\".\n\nIf we go with:\n- 🥵=e (given)\n- 🐹=c\n- 😇=h\n- 🐔=a\n- 🥺=l\n- 😴=g\n- 🥶=r\n\nThen the first word becomes \"challenger\".\n\nIf we also assume:\n- The fourth word 🐵👽 is \"in\" (🐵=i, 👽=n)\n- The last word 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 is \"since\" (🤥=s, 🥺=i, 🐵=n, 🤑=c, 🤠=e)\n\nBut there's an issue: if 🐵=i for \"in\" and 🐵=n for \"since\", that's a contradiction. So, at least one of my assumptions must be wrong.\n\nAlright, let's take a systematic approach.\n\nI'm given 🥵=e.\n\nThe fourth word 🐵👽 is a two-letter word. Common two-letter words in English include:\n- \"to\" (🐵=t, 👽=o)\n- \"in\" (🐵=i, 👽=n)\n- \"of\" (🐵=o, 👽=f)\n- \"at\" (🐵=a, 👽=t)\n\nLet's try \"in\" (🐵=i, 👽=n):\n🐹😇🐔🐔e🥺😴e🥶 i🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 n🐹e🥶😇ie🧐 in 🦆n🥶🐼e🐔 🤥🥺i🤑🤠 1983.\n\nThis doesn't seem right. Let me try \"to\" (🐵=t, 👽=o):\n🐹😇🐔🐔e🥺😴e🥶 t🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 o🐹e🥶😇te🧐 to 🦆o🥶🐼e🐔 🤥🥺t🤑🤠 1983.\n\nThis seems more promising. If the first word is \"challenger\":\n- 🐹=c\n- 😇=h\n- 🐔=a\n- 🥺=l\n- 😴=g\n- 🥶=r\n\nThe sixth word 🤥🥺t🤑🤠 would then be 🤥lt🤑e, which doesn't form a recognizable word with our current guesses.\n\nLet me reconsider. If I already know 🥵=e, 🐹=c, 😇=h, 🐔=a, and 🥶=r, let's use these to guess more:\n\n🐹😇🐔🐔e🥺😴e🥶 = c h a a e 🥺 😴 e r\n\nIf the first word is \"challenger\", then 🥺=l and 😴=g.\n\nThe second word t🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 = t r a 🤑 l a would be \"trails\" if 🤑=i, which seems plausible.\n\nThe third word o🐹e🥶😇te🧐 = o 🐹 e r a t e 🧐 could be \"operated\" if 🐹=p and 🧐=d.\n\nBut wait, if 🐹=c for \"challenger\", it can't also be 🐹=p for \"operated\". This suggests my understanding of the words might be off.\n\nLet me go back to:\n🐹😇🐔🐔e🥺😴e🥶 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 👽🐹e🥶😇🐵e🧐 🐵👽 🦆👽🥶🐼e🐔 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 1983.\n\nWith 🥵=e, and if 🐵👽 is \"in\", then:\n🐹😇🐔🐔e🥺😴e🥶 i🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 n🐹e🥶😇ie🧐 in 🦆n🥶🐼e🐔 🤥🥺i🤑🤠 1983.\n\nOr if 🐵👽 is \"to\", then:\n🐹😇🐔🐔e🥺😴e🥶 t🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 o🐹e🥶😇te🧐 to 🦆o🥶🐼e🐔 🤥🥺t🤑🤠 1983.\n\nLet's try \"to\" and see if we can make sense:\nchallenger trails operated to 🦆orpe🐔 since 1983.\n\nIf 🦆=s, 🐼=p, 🐔=a, 🤥=s, 🥺=i, 🤑=c, 🤠=e, the sentence becomes:\nchallenger trails operated to space since 1983.\n\nAha! This could be it. However, I need to double-check for any conflicts.\n\nMapping:\n- 🥵=e (given)\n- 🐹=c\n- 😇=h\n- 🐔=a\n- 🥺=l (for \"challenger\") or i (for \"since\")\n- 😴=g\n- 🥶=r\n- 🐵=t\n- 👽=o\n- 🦆=s\n- 🐼=p\n- 🤥=s (conflicts with 🦆=s?)\n- 🤑=c (conflicts with 🐹=c?)\n- 🤠=e (conflicts with 🥵=e?)\n\nThere seem to be some conflicts. Let me reconsider the words.\n\nIf the first word is \"challenger\" and the second word is \"trails\", the third word could be \"operate\" or \"opening\" or similar. The fifth word, if 🦆=s, 🐼=p, and 🐔=a, would be \"space\".\n\nLet's try to work with these assumptions and see if we can get a coherent sentence.\n\nIf the first word is \"challenger\" (🐹=c, 😇=h, 🐔=a, 🥺=l, 😴=g, 🥶=r), the sentence starts:\nchallenger ...\n\nIf the second word is \"trails\" (🐵=t, 🥶=r, 😇=a, 🤑=i, 🥺=l, 🐔=s), then:\nchallenger trails ...\n\nBut this creates a conflict: 🥺 would be both 'l' (from \"challenger\") and 's' (from \"trails\").\n\nLet me reconsider. Rather than assuming specific words, let me deduce from the structure.\n\nThe sentence is:\n🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 🐵👽 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 1983.\n\nWith 🥵=e:\n🐹😇🐔🐔e🥺😴e🥶 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 👽🐹e🥶😇🐵e🧐 🐵👽 🦆👽🥶🐼e🐔 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 1983.\n\nThe fourth word 🐵👽 is a two-letter word. If I assume it's \"to\", then 🐵=t and 👽=o.\n\"toooo\"\n\nSubstituting:\n🐹😇🐔🐔e🥺😴e🥶 t🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 o🐹e🥶😇te🧐 to 🦆o🥶🐼e🐔 🤥🥺t🤑🤠 1983.\n\nNote that the third word contains \"te\" (🐵e), which could be part of words like \"operated\", \"started\", \"created\".\n\nThe last word 🤥🥺t🤑🤠 ends with 'e' (🤠), which could be words like \"since\", \"where\", \"while\".\n\nGiven the context about space and history, if I assume the first word is \"challenger\" (the space shuttle), then 🐹=c, 😇=h, 🐔=a, 🥺=l, 😴=g, and 🥶=r.\n\nSubstituting:\nchallenger tral🤑la o🐹erateπ to 🦆or🐼ea 🤥lt🤑e 1983.\n\nHmm. There are potential conflicts. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet's analyze emoji frequency:\n- 🥵 (e) appears 6 times (this is our hint)\n- 🐵 appears 5 times\n- 🐔 appears 5 times\n- 🥶 appears 5 times\n- 👽 appears 4 times\n- 😇 appears 4 times\n- 🥺 appears 4 times\n\nIn English, common letters are e, t, a, o, i, n, s, h, r, l.\nSo, 🐵, 🐔, and 🥶 could potentially represent t, a, and r in some order.\n\nLet's assume 🥶=r, 🐔=a, and 🐵=t:\n🐹ha🐔e🥺😴er tra😇🤑🥺a o🐹era𝐭e🧐 to 🦆or🐼ea 🤥🥺t🤑🤠 1983.\n\nThis looks promising. If 😇=i, 🤑=l, and 🥺=n, we get:\n𝐹halle😴er traina o🐹erate🧐 to 🦆or🐼ea 🤥nt𝐹e 1983.\n\nIf 😴=g and 🧐=d, it becomes:\n𝐹halleger traima operated to 🦆or🐼ea 🤥nt𝐹e 1983.\n\nAnalyzing further, if 🐹=c, the sentence becomes:\nchallenger traima operated to 🦆or🐼ea 🤥ntce 1983.\n\nIf \"🦆or🐼ea\" is \"korea\", then 🦆=k, 🐼=o (conflicts with 👽=o).\n\nHmm, let me reconsider. Maybe the fourth word isn't \"to\" but \"in\".\n\nIf 🐵👽 is \"in\", then 🐵=i and 👽=n:\n🐹ha🐔e🥺😴er irai🤑🥺a n🐹erai𝐞d in 🦆nr🐼ea 🤥🥺i𝐹 1983.\n\nWait, that's messy, there are contradictions. Let's recalibrate.\n\nLet's stick with 🥵=e and try to determine what the other emojis represent based on a logical approach.\n\nGiven that 🐵 appears 5 times, let's try 🐵=t (a common letter):\n🐹😇🐔🐔e🥺😴e🥶 t🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 👽🐹e🥶😇te🧐 t👽 🦆👽🥶🐼e🐔 🤥🥺t🤑🤠 1983.\n\nAnd given that 🥶 appears 5 times, let's try 🥶=r (another common letter):\n🐹😇🐔🐔e🥺😴er tr😇🤑🥺🐔 👽🐹er😇te🧐 t👽 🦆👽r🐼e🐔 🤥🥺t🤑🤠 1983.\n\nAnd given that 🐔 appears 5 times, let's try 🐔=a (yet another common letter):\n🐹😇aae🥺😴er tra🤑🥺a 👽🐹er😇te🧐 t👽 🦆👽r🐼ea 🤥🥺t🤑🤠 1983.\n\nHmm. I'm still not seeing an obvious word emerge.\n\nLet me take another look at the first word: 🐹😇🐔🐔e🥺😴er\nIf I substitute e, t, r, and a, I get: 🐹😇aaetrater\nThat's not forming a clear word.\n\nLet's take a different approach for the fourth word. If 🐵👽 is \"of\", then 🐵=o and 👽=f:\n🐹😇aae𝑙😴er ora🤑la f🐹er😇oe𝑑 of 🦆fr🐼ea 🤥lo🤑e 1983.\n\nSince we're looking at a date and a potentially historic event, my instinct is leaning towards the first word being \"challenger\" (the space shuttle) or \"internet\" (ARPANET adoption of TCP\/IP in 1983).\n\nFor \"challenger\":\n- 🐹=c\n- 😇=h\n- 🐔=a\n- 🥵=e (given)\n- 🥺=l\n- 😴=g\n- 🥶=r\n\nFor \"internet\":\n- 🐹=i\n- 😇=n\n- 🐔=t\n- 🥵=e (given)\n- 🥺=r\n- 😴=n (conflicts with 😇=n)\n- 🥶=t (conflicts with 🐔=t)\n\n\"Challenger\" seems more plausible given the constraints.\n\nIf the first word is \"challenger\", the sentence might start:\nchallenger tra🤑la o🐹erate𝑑 to 🦆or🐼ea 🤥lt🤑e 1983.\n\nIf the third word is \"operated\" (or a verb with a similar ending), then 👽=o, 🐹=p, 🧐=d:\nchallenger tra🤑la operated to 🦆or🐼ea 🤥lt🤑e 1983.\n\nBut there's a conflict: 🐹=c (for \"challenger\") and 🐹=p (for \"operated\").\n\nSo far, I don't have a conclusive decoding, so my answers remain tentative.\n\nAlright, I need to guess a consistent mapping. Given what I know so far:\n- 🥵=e (given)\n- 🥶=r (likely, based on frequency)\n- 🐔=a (likely, based on frequency)\n- 🐵=t (likely, based on frequency)\n- 👽=o (guessing)\n- 🐹=c (for \"challenger\")\n- 😇=h (for \"challenger\")\n- 🥺=l (for \"challenger\")\n- 😴=g (for \"challenger\")\n- 🧐=d (guess based on verb ending in third word)\n- 🦆=s (guess for fifth word, possibly \"space\")\n- 🐼=p (guess for fifth word, possibly \"space\")\n- 🤥=s (potential conflict with 🦆=s, part of last word)\n- 🤑=i (guess)\n- 🤠=n (guess)\n\nNote: This is not a full set of guesses since there are conflicts, but it's a start.\n\nActually, I'm having trouble resolving the conflicts. Let me start with a clean slate and make consistent guesses.\n\nGiven:\n- 🥵=e (hint provided)\n\nLet's guess these common letters based on frequency:\n- 🥶=r\n- 🐔=a\n- 🐵=t\n- 👽=o\n- 😇=i\n- 🥺=n\n\nThe encoded sentence with these substitutions:\nchaaneir traini operated to 🦆ropei 🤥ntci 1983.\n\nThe first word could be \"challenger\" if:\n- 🐹=c\n- 😇=h\n- 🐔=a\n- 🥵=e (given)\n- 🥺=l (conflicts with my guess of 🥺=n)\n- 😴=g\n- 🥶=r (matches my guess)\n\nSo, there's a potential conflict with 🥺. If we adjust and say 🥺=l, the substitutions become:\nchalleler traili operated to 🦆ropei 🤥ltci 1983.\n\nThe second word looks like it could be \"trails\" if 🤑=s.\n\nLet me see if I can form a coherent guess:\n- 🥵=e (given)\n- 🐹=c\n- 😇=h\n- 🐔=a\n- 🥺=l\n- 😴=g\n- 🥶=r\n- 🐵=t\n- 👽=o\n- 🦆=s\n- 🐼=p\n- 🤥=s (conflicts with 🦆=s)\n- 🤑=i\n- 🤠=n\n\nThis gives:\nchallenger trails operated to spaces sincin 1983.\n\nThe last word doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me recheck the encoded sentence.

If the last word is \"until\":\n- 🤥=u\n- 🥺=n (conflicts with 🥺=l)\n- 🐵=t (matches my guess)\n- 🤑=i (matches my guess)\n- 🤠=l (conflicts with 🥺=l)\n\nSo there are still conflicts. Maybe the last word is \"since\"?\n- 🤥=s\n- 🥺=i (conflicts with 🤑=i and 🥺=l)\n- 🐵=n (conflicts with 🐵=t)\n- 🤑=c (conflicts with 🤑=i)\n- 🤠=e (conflicts with 🥵=e)\n\nThe conflicts continue.Looking at the encoded sentence: 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 🐵👽 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 1983.\n\nI know that 🥵=e, and I need to decipher the rest of the emojis.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the structure and frequency of the emojis:\n- The sentence has 6 words before the date 1983\n- Word lengths: 9, 6, 8, 2, 6, 5\n- The fourth word 🐵👽 is a 2-letter word, likely \"in,\" \"to,\" \"of,\" or similar\n\nLooking at the first word 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶, it has 'e' as the 5th and 7th letter. Words with this pattern include \"challenger.\"\n\nIf the first word is \"challenger,\" then:\n- 🐹=c\n- 😇=h\n- 🐔=a\n- 🥵=e (confirmed)\n- 🥺=l\n- 😴=g\n- 🥶=r\n\nTesting these on the rest of the sentence:\nchallenger 🐵ra🤑l🐔 👽🐹era🐵e🧐 🐵👽 🦆👽r🐼e🐔 🤥l🐵🤑🤠 1983.\n\nThe second word looks like \"trails\" if:\n- 🐵=t\n- 🤑=i\n\nThe third word would then be \"operated\" if:\n- 👽=o\n- 🐹=p (but this conflicts with 🐹=c)\n\nI need to reconsider. Let's try a different approach:\n\nIf I keep 🥵=e, 🥶=r, 🐔=a, 🥺=l, and assume:\n- 🐵=t\n- 👽=o\n- 🦆=s\n- 🐼=p\n- 🧐=d\n- 🤑=i\n- 🤠=n\n\nThe sentence becomes:\nchallenger trails operated to spaces 🤥ltin 1983.\n\nThe last word could be \"until\" if 🤥=u and 🤠=l.\n\nPutting it all together, I believe the sentence is:\n\"Challenger trails operated to spaces until 1983.\"\n\nThis makes sense historically, as Challenger was a space shuttle that operated until its tragic mission in 1986, though it began operations before 1983.\n\nAnswer: 🥵=e,🐹=c,😇=h,🐔=a,🥺=l,😴=g,🥶=r,🐵=t,👽=o,🤑=i,🦆=s,🐼=p,🧐=d,🤥=u,🤠=l","HTTPError 529: {\"error\":{\"message\":\"-4316: Overloaded\",\"code\":\"-4307\"}}","HTTPError 529: {\"error\":{\"message\":\"-4316: Overloaded\",\"code\":\"-4307\"}}","HTTPError 529: {\"error\":{\"message\":\"-4316: Overloaded\",\"code\":\"-4307\"}}","Let's analyze the feedback we got for our first guess. \nThe True entries mean our guess was correct, and the False entries mean our guess was wrong.\n\nThe correct guesses are:\n- 🥵 = e (This is the hint, and we got it right)\n- 😴 = g\n- 🥶 = r\n- 🐵 = t\n- 👽 = o\n- 🤑 = i\n- 🧐 = d\n- 🤥 = u\n- 🤠 = l\n\nThe wrong guesses are:\n- 🐹 ≠ c\n- 😇 ≠ h\n- 🐔 ≠ a\n- 🥺 ≠ l\n- 🦆 ≠ s\n- 🐼 ≠ p\n\nNow let's look at the encoded sentence with our correct guesses filled in:\n\n🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 🐵👽 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 1983.\n\nFilling in the known values:\n🐹😇🐔🐔eger 🐵r😇i🥺🐔 o🐹er😇🐵ed 🐵o 🦆or🐼e🐔 u🥺🐵il 1983.\n\nThis looks like a sentence about something that operated from a certain date until 1983. Let me try to figure out the missing emojis:\n\n- 🐹: Since we know it's not 'c', it could be another common first letter like 'b', 'w', or 's'.\n- 😇: Not 'h'... maybe 'a' or 'o'?\n- 🐔: Not 'a'... maybe 'n', 'l', or 's'?\n- 🥺: Not 'l'... maybe 'n' or 'm'?\n\nLet me try to recognize patterns or words here.\n\nThe first word could be something like \"passenger\", \"bigger\", \"logger\", etc.\nThe second word looks like it could be \"trains\", \"tribes\", etc.\nThe third word looks like it could be \"operated\".\nThe phrase \"to 🦆or🐼e🐔\" could be something like \"to market\", \"to serve\", etc.\n\nLet's make educated guesses for this round:\n\n🐹 = p (as in \"passenger\")\n😇 = a (as in \"passenger\")\n🐔 = n (as in \"passenger\")\n🥺 = n (as in \"until\")\n🦆 = m (as in \"market\")\n🐼 = k (as in \"market\")\n\nLet me check if this makes sense:\n🐹😇🐔🐔eger 🐵r😇i🥺🐔 o🐹er😇🐵ed 🐵o 🦆or🐼e🐔 u🥺🐵il 1983.\npanenger train operated to market until 1983.\n\nThis is still not fully coherent. Let me try different substitutions.\n\nActually, the first word might be \"passenger\" and the second word \"trains\" - this would make sense in the context of transportation history.\n\nLet's try again:\n\n🐹 = p\n😇 = a\n🐔 = s\n🥺 = n\n🦆 = m\n🐼 = k\n\nThis would give us:\npassenger trains operated to market until 1983.\n\nThis still doesn't quite sound right with \"market\". Let me try again with another set of guesses.\n\nThe structure of the sentence suggests it could be about transportation or some system that was operational until 1983. The phrase \"🐵o 🦆or🐼e🐔\" might be \"to former\" or \"to foreign\".\n\nNew guesses:\n🐹 = p\n😇 = a\n🐔 = s\n🥺 = n\n🦆 = f\n🐼 = m\n\nThis would give:\npassenger trains operated to former until 1983.\n\nThat still doesn't flow naturally.\n\nLet's try another approach. If the first word is \"passenger\", the pattern would be:\n🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 = p-a-s-s-e-n-g-e-r\n\nBut we know that 🐹 is not 'c', 😇 is not 'h', 🐔 is not 'a', etc. So \"passenger\" doesn't fit the pattern.\n\nLet me think of other possibilities for the first word. Looking at the pattern 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶, it could be words like \"messenger\", \"billenger\" (though that's not a common word).\n\nWait, it could be \"messenger\"!\n🐹 = m\n😇 = e\n🐔 = s\n🥺 = n\n😴 = g\n🥵 = e\n🥶 = r\n\nLet me check if this fits:\nmessenger treis operated to formes until 1983.\n\nThat's not quite right.\n\nOk, let's think more systematically. The sentence structure suggests something like \"[something] [something] operated [in\/to] [somewhere] until 1983.\"\n\nGiven our correct guesses (e, g, r, t, o, i, d, u, l), let's fill in what we know:\n🐹😇🐔🐔eger 🐵r😇i🥺🐔 o🐹er😇🐵ed 🐵o 🦆or🐼e🐔 u🥺🐵il 1983.\n\nIf the second word is \"trains\", then we would have:\n🐵r😇i🥺🐔 = tr😇ins\n\nSo 😇 = a and 🥺 = n, making the second word \"trains\".\n\nIf 😇 = a and 🥺 = n, then the first word would be:\n🐹a🐔🐔enger\n\nFor this to be a meaningful word, 🐹 could be 'p' and 🐔 could be 's', making the word \"passenger\".\n\nThen the phrase would be:\npassenger trains operated to 🦆or🐼es until 1983.\n\nLet's continue: \"operated to 🦆or🐼es\" could be \"operated to formes\". \n\nSo 🦆 = f and 🐼 = m, making the phrase \"operated to formes\". This doesn't sound right, unless \"formes\" is a specific place or term I'm not familiar with.\n\nActually, it might be \"operated to [somewhere] until 1983.\" The missing word could be a place or destination.\n\nLet's see if we can find a pattern that makes sense:\n\n🦆or🐼es could be \"formes\", \"forbes\", \"forges\", etc.\n\nI'm thinking it might be \"forbes\", as in Forbes magazine or a place named Forbes. But then the sentence would be \"passenger trains operated to forbes until 1983\", which might make sense if Forbes is a place.\n\nLet's go with these guesses for our answer:\n\n🐹 = p\n😇 = a\n🐔 = s\n🥺 = n\n🦆 = f\n🐼 = b\n\nWith these guesses, the sentence would read:\n\"passenger trains operated to forbes until 1983.\"\n\nSo our final answer for this attempt is:\n🥵=e (from the hint),\n🐹=p,\n😇=a,\n🐔=s,\n🥺=n,\n😴=g,\n🥶=r,\n🐵=t,\n👽=o,\n🤑=i,\n🦆=f,\n🐼=b,\n🧐=d,\n🤥=u,\n🤠=l\n\nHowever, as I think about it more, if we're guessing about a historical fact, we might be on the wrong track. It could be a different transportation mode or a different context altogether. But without additional information, my best guess is the one I laid out above.\n\nLet me check once more if there might be a more obvious interpretation.\n\nThe sentence structure suggests something historical that operated until 1983. \"passenger trains\" seems plausible for the beginning. The phrase \"operated to forbes\" is specific, which might indicate a place or destination. But if \"forbes\" isn't a place, I might be interpreting it wrong.\n\nActually, it could be \"Soviet Union\". Let's check if that fits:\n🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 = soviet union?\n\nNo, that doesn't match the pattern.\n\nLet me stick with my original interpretation: \"passenger trains operated to forbes until 1983.\"\n\nSo my guesses for this round are:\n🥵=e (from the hint),\n🐹=p,\n😇=a,\n🐔=s,\n🥺=n,\n😴=g (from the previous correct guess),\n🥶=r (from the previous correct guess),\n🐵=t (from the previous correct guess),\n👽=o (from the previous correct guess),\n🤑=i (from the previous correct guess),\n🦆=f,\n🐼=b,\n🧐=d (from the previous correct guess),\n🤥=u (from the previous correct guess),\n🤠=l (from the previous correct guess)Looking at the feedback from my first guess, I need to re-analyze this encoded sentence.\n\nFirst, let me identify what we know for sure (the correct guesses from round 1):\n- 🥵 = e\n- 😴 = g\n- 🥶 = r\n- 🐵 = t\n- 👽 = o\n- 🤑 = i\n- 🧐 = d\n- 🤥 = u\n- 🤠 = l\n\nWhen I fill these in, the sentence looks like:\n🐹😇🐔🐔eger 🐵r😇i🥺🐔 o🐹er😇🐵ed 🐵o 🦆or🐼e🐔 u🥺🐵il 1983.\n\nBased on the structure and context, this appears to be about something that operated until 1983. The first word has the pattern of \"passenger\" and the second word could be \"trains.\" The sentence likely describes a transportation system that operated to some destination until 1983.\n\nMy new guesses:\n- 🐹 = p (first letter of \"passenger\")\n- 😇 = a (second letter of \"passenger\" and \"trains\")\n- 🐔 = s (appears multiple times in logical positions)\n- 🥺 = n (fits in \"trains\" and \"until\")\n- 🦆 = f (beginning of destination)\n- 🐼 = b (part of destination name)\n\nWith these substitutions, the sentence would read:\n\"passenger trains operated to forbes until 1983.\"\n\nThis makes logical sense as a historical transportation statement.\n\nAnswer: 🥵=e,😴=g,🥶=r,🐵=t,👽=o,🤑=i,🧐=d,🤥=u,🤠=l,🐹=p,😇=a,🐔=s,🥺=n,🦆=f,🐼=b"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
