The word `t🐭💩` appears twice, and `💩 = e`, so it starts with `t` and ends with `e`. Common English words fitting this pattern are \"the\", \"tie\", \"toe\", etc. \"the\" is the most likely candidate.\n   - Guess: `t🐭💩 = the` → `🐭 = h`\n\n2. The word `t💩🐰🤑` starts with `t`, has `e` in the middle, and ends with `🤑`. Possible words: \"teach\", \"tease\", \"teeth\", etc. \"teach\" or \"teeth\" seem plausible.\n   - Tentative: `🤑` could be `a`, `c`, or `h`.\n\n3. The word `😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt` has a repeating pattern `😂nt😂nt`. This resembles words like \"accountant\" or \"consistent\". Given `💩 = e` and `🐭 = h`, \"accountant\" fits:\n   - `😂 = a`, `c = c`, `🐶 = o`, `🧐 = u`, `n = n`, `t = t`.\n   - So: `😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt = accountant` → `😂 = a`, `🐶 = o`, `🧐 = u`.\n\n4. Now, let's check `f🐰🐶🤑`:\n   - `🐶 = o`, so `f🐰o🤑`. Possible words: \"focus\", \"fools\", \"foams\", etc. \"focus\" seems likely:\n     - `🐰 = u`, `🤑 = s`.\n\n5. Verify `🤗🐶🐰🤮`:\n   - `🐶 = o`, `🐰 = u`, so `🤗ou🤮`. Possible words: \"house\", \"housy\", etc. \"house\" fits:\n     - `🤗 = h`, `🤮 = s` (but `🤑 = s` from earlier, so this contradicts. Maybe `🤮 = e`? But `💩 = e`. Alternatively, `🤮 = d` for \"hound\", but less likely. Maybe `🤮 = y` for \"housy\" is not common. Re-evaluate `🤑`:\n       - If `🤑 = c` (from \"teach\"), then `f🐰o🤑 = fuoc` doesn't make sense. So `🤑 = s` is better, and `🤮` must be another letter. Maybe `🤮 = e` is forced, but `💩 = e`. So perhaps `🤮 = m` for \"houm...\" Not clear. Maybe `🤗 = w`, `🤮 = d` for \"wood\"? Not matching. Alternatively, `🤗 = s`, `🤮 = e` (but `💩 = e`). This is tricky.\n\n6. Reconstruct with current guesses:\n   - `💩 = e`, `🐭 = h`, `😂 = a`, `🐶 = o`, `🧐 = u`, `🐰 = u`, `🤑 = s`.\n   - `f🐰🐶🤑 = fuos` → Doesn't make sense. Maybe `🐰 = l` (for \"flos\" → no). Maybe `🐰 = i` (for \"fios\" → no). Alternatively, `🐰 = r` (for \"fros\" → no). Maybe `🤑 = t` (but `t = t`). This suggests `🐰 = a` conflicts with `😂 = a`.\n\n   Perhaps `😂 = i` (for \"iccountint\" → no). Maybe `😂 = c` (but `c = c`). This is confusing. Maybe initial assumption `t🐭💩 = the` is correct, but other guesses are off.\n\n### Revised Approach:\nStick with `t🐭💩 = the` → `🐭 = h`, `💩 = e`.\nNow look at `😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt`:\n- If `😂 = a`, `c = c`, `🐶 = c`, `🧐 = o`, `n = n`, `t = t` → \"accountant\":\n  - `😂 = a`, `🐶 = o`, `🧐 = u`.\nNow `f🐰🐶🤑`:\n- `🐶 = o`, so `f🐰o🤑`. Possible: \"food\" → `🐰 = o` (but `🐶 = o`), \"foot\" → `🤑 = t`, `🐰 = o`. But `t = t`, so `🤑 = t` is invalid. \"fool\" → `🤑 = l`, `🐰 = o`. \"fora\" → no. Maybe \"fool\" is best:\n  - `🐰 = o`, `🤑 = l`.\n\nNow `🤗🐶🐰🤮`:\n- `🐶 = o`, `🐰 = o`, so `🤗oo🤮`. Possible: \"good\" → `🤗 = g`, `🤮 = d`.\n- Or \"mood\" → `🤗 = m`, `🤮 = d`.\n- Or \"book\" → `🤗 = b`, `🤮 = k`.\n\n\"Good\" is more common:\n- `🤗 = g`, `🤮 = d`.\n\nNow `t💩🐰🤑`:\n- `💩 = e`, `🐰 = o`, `🤑 = l` → \"teol\" → no. Maybe `🤑 = a` (from earlier \"teach\"):\n  - Then `f🐰o🤑 = foaa` → no. Contradiction.\n\nAlternative: `🤑 = m` (for \"team\"):\n- `f🐰o🤑 = foom` → no.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe `🐰 = r` (for \"from\"):\n- `f🐰o🤑 = fro🤑`. If `🤑 = m` → \"from\".\n\nThen `🤗🐶🐰🤮`:\n- `🐶 = o`, `🐰 = r` → `🤗or🤮`. \"word\" → `🤗 = w`, `🤮 = d`.\n\nNow `t💩🐰🤑`:\n- `💩 = e`, `🐰 = r`, `🤑 = m` → \"term\".\n\nNow check `🙄🐵`:\n- Could be \"is\", \"in\", \"it\", etc. \"is\" is common:\n  - `🙄 = i`, `🐵 = s`.\n\nNow `🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮`:\n- `🤮 = d`, `💩 = e`, `🐰 = r`, `🙄 = i`, so `derei🤥ed`. Maybe \"decided\":\n  - `🤥 = c`.\n\nNow `😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nc🥵`:\n- `😂 = a`, `c = c`, `🐶 = o`, `🧐 = u`, `n = n`, `t = t`, `🥵 = ?`:\n  - \"accountanc🥵\" → \"accountancy\":\n    - `🥵 = y`.\n\nNow `f🐰🐶🤑`:\n- `🐰 = r`, `🐶 = o`, `🤑 = m` → \"from\".\n\n### Final Assignments:\n- `💩 = e`\n- `🐭 = h`\n- `😂 = a`\n- `🐶 = o`\n- `🧐 = u`\n- `🐰 = r`\n- `🤑 = m`\n- `🤗 = w`\n- `🤮 = d`\n- `🙄 = i`\n- `🐵 = s`\n- `🤥 = c`\n- `🥵 = y`\n\n### Answer:\nAnswer: 💩=e,🐭=h,😂=a,🐶=o,🧐=u,🐰=r,🤑=m,🤗=w,🤮=d,🙄=i,🐵=s,🤥=c,🥵=y","Based on the provided information and feedback from the first attempt, we can deduce the following correct mappings:\n\n- 💩 = e\n- 🐭 = h\n- 😂 = a\n- 🐶 = o\n- 🧐 = u\n- 🐰 = r\n- 🤑 = m\n- 🤗 = w\n- 🤮 = d\n- 🙄 = i\n- 🐵 = s\n- 🥵 = y\n\nThe incorrect mapping from the first attempt was:\n- 🤥 = c (this was incorrect, so 🤥 is not c)\n\nNow, let's look at the encoded sentence with the known mappings:\n\nf🐰🐶🤑 t🐭💩 🤗🐶🐰🤮 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt t🐭💩 t💩🐰🤑 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nc🥵 🙄🐵 🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮.\n\nSubstituting the known emojis:\n\nf r o m t h e w o r d a c c o u n t a n t t h e t e r m a c c o u n t a n c y i s d e i 🤥 e d.\n\nFrom this, we can see that the word \"accountant\" and \"accountancy\" are present, which suggests that the remaining emojis likely correspond to the remaining letters in these words.\n\nLooking at \"accountant\":\na c c o u n t a n t\n😂 c c 🐶 🧐 n t 😂 n t\n\nWe know:\n😂 = a\n🐶 = o\n🧐 = u\n\nSo the remaining letters are c, n, t. We already have t mapped to 💩 = e, which is incorrect because 💩 is e. Wait, this seems conflicting. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, in \"accountant\", the letters are a, c, c, o, u, n, t, a, n, t. We have:\n😂 = a\n🐶 = o\n🧐 = u\n💩 = e (but e is not in \"accountant\", so this is fine)\nSo the remaining letters in \"accountant\" are c, n, t.\n\nFrom the first guess, 🤥 was guessed as c but was incorrect, so c must be another emoji. Looking at the encoded sentence, the emojis not yet mapped are f, t, c, n, 🤥.\n\nIn \"accountant\", the c appears twice, and in the encoded sentence, the c emoji appears twice in \"😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt\", so likely c is the emoji that appears twice here. The emojis in \"😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt\" are 😂, c, c, 🐶, 🧐, n, t, 😂, n, t. So c is likely the emoji that is not yet mapped and appears twice here. The only unmapped emoji here is 'c', but 'c' is not an emoji, it's a letter. Wait, perhaps the 'c' in the encoded sentence is the placeholder for the actual emoji. It seems there might be a confusion in the representation.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the word \"from\":\nf r o m\nf 🐰 🐶 🤑\nWe know 🐰 = r, 🐶 = o, 🤑 = m, so f must be the emoji at the start, which is 'f'. So likely 'f' is an emoji representing 'f'.\n\nSimilarly, \"the\":\nt h e\nt 🐭 💩\n🐭 = h, 💩 = e, so t must be the emoji representing 't'.\n\n\"word\":\nw o r d\n🤗 🐶 🐰 🤮\n🤗 = w, 🐶 = o, 🐰 = r, 🤮 = d, so this is correct.\n\n\"accountant\":\na c c o u n t a n t\n😂 c c 🐶 🧐 n t 😂 n t\n😂 = a, 🐶 = o, 🧐 = u, so c must be 'c', n must be 'n', t must be 't'. So the emojis c, n, t correspond to 'c', 'n', 't'.\n\nSimilarly, \"accountancy\":\na c c o u n t a n c y\n😂 c c 🐶 🧐 n t 😂 n c 🥵\n😂 = a, 🐶 = o, 🧐 = u, 🥵 = y, so c = 'c', n = 'n', t = 't'.\n\n\"is\":\ni s\n🙄 🐵\n🙄 = i, 🐵 = s, correct.\n\n\"dei🤥ed\":\nd e i 🤥 e d\n🤮 💩 🙄 🤥 💩 🤮\n🤮 = d, 💩 = e, 🙄 = i, so 🤥 must be the letter between 'i' and 'e' in \"dei🤥ed\". The word seems to be \"decided\", so 🤥 = 'c'.\n\nBut in the first guess, 🤥=c was incorrect, so this is conflicting. Maybe the word is \"delighted\", but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, \"desired\"? Not matching. Maybe \"defined\"? Not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the word is \"divided\":\nd i v i d e d\n🤮 🙄 v 🙄 🤮 💩 🤮\nBut we don't have 'v' mapped. This is confusing.\n\nGiven that 🤥 was guessed as 'c' and was incorrect, and the only remaining letter in \"accountant\" is 'n' and 't', perhaps 🤥 is 'n' or 't'. But 'n' and 't' are already in \"accountant\" as emojis c and n and t. This seems inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps the correct mappings are:\n- 'c' is the emoji 'c' (but 'c' is a letter, not an emoji)\n- 'n' is the emoji 'n'\n- 't' is the emoji 't'\n\nBut this seems unlikely. Maybe the emojis for 'c', 'n', 't' are not yet assigned. Looking back, the emojis not yet mapped are f, t, c, n, 🤥.\n\nFrom \"from\":\nf 🐰 🐶 🤑 = f r o m, so f = 'f'\n\nFrom \"the\":\nt 🐭 💩 = t h e, so t = 't'\n\nFrom \"accountant\":\n😂 c c 🐶 🧐 n t 😂 n t = a c c o u n t a n t\nSo c = 'c', n = 'n', t = 't'\n\nFrom \"dei🤥ed\":\n🤮 💩 🙄 🤥 💩 🤮 = d e i 🤥 e d\nSo 🤥 must be the letter between 'i' and 'e'. If the word is \"decided\", then 🤥 = 'c', but that was incorrect. Maybe \"delayed\"? Not matching. Maybe \"derived\"? Not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the word is \"desired\":\nd e s i r e d\nBut 's' is 🐵 = s, 'r' is 🐰 = r, so:\n🤮 💩 🐵 🙄 🐰 💩 🤮 = d e s i r e d\nBut this would require 🤥 to be 🐵 = s, but 🐵 is already 's'. This is not matching.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the correct mappings are:\n- f = 'f'\n- t = 't'\n- c = 'c'\n- n = 'n'\n- 🤥 = 'v' (as in \"divided\")\n\nBut this is speculative. Given the information, the most plausible remaining mappings are:\n- f = 'f'\n- t = 't'\n- c = 'c'\n- n = 'n'\n- 🤥 = 'v'\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: f=f,t=t,c=c,n=n,🤥=v"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Incorrect guesses from History:\n   - 🤫≠t\n   - 🐯≠r\n   - 😂≠w\n\nNow, let's analyze the encoded sentence with the correct guesses filled in:\n\n\"🤫oi🤫oa was an ipmportant 🤫ommmoit😂 in pr🤥-🤫ol🐦m🙄ian m🤥soam🤥rim🤫a.\"\n\nFrom this, we can make educated guesses for the remaining emojis:\n\n- \"important\" is a clear word in the sentence, which suggests:\n  - 🤫 is likely \"i\" (since \"important\" starts with \"i\" and 🤫 appears at the start of words)\n  - But 🤫 was guessed as \"t\" in the first attempt and was incorrect, so it can't be \"t\". Given that \"important\" is \"ipmportant\" with 🤫=i, this seems likely, but contradicts the first guess feedback where 🤫 was not \"t\". Maybe 🤫 is \"i\" and was incorrectly marked as false in feedback? Alternatively, maybe \"important\" is \"mpmportant\" with 🐔=m, but that seems less likely.\n\nWait, the first guess had 🤫=t which was incorrect, so 🤫 is not \"t\". Maybe \"important\" is \"ipmportant\" with 🤫=i, but then why was 🤫=t incorrect? Maybe the word is \"important\" with 🤫=i, 🐯=p, but 🐯 was guessed as \"r\" and was incorrect. But 😴=p is correct, so 🐯 can't be \"p\". Maybe \"important\" is \"ipmportant\" with 🤫=i, 🐯=m, but 🐔=m is already correct. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"important\" is \"ipmportant\" with 🤫=i, 🐯=r (but 🐯=r was incorrect in first guess). Maybe the correct word is \"important\" with 🤫=i, 🐯=n (but \"important\" has no \"n\"). Maybe \"important\" is \"ipmportant\" with 🤫=i, 🐯=a.\n\nGiven the confusion, let's try to guess other words:\n\n- \"was an\" is clear, so no new info.\n- \"in\" is 🐷n, 🐷=i, so n is likely 😂 (but 😂≠w from first guess).\n- \"pr🤥-\" could be \"pre-\", \"pro-\", etc. Maybe 🤥=e.\n- \"ian\" is 🐷an, 🐷=i, so \"ian\" is correct.\n- \"m🤥soam🤥rim🤫a\" could be \"mesoamerican\" or similar. If 🤥=e, then \"mesoamerican\" fits:\n  - m🤥soam🤥rim🤫a = m e s o a m e r i m i a (but \"mesoamerican\" is m e s o a m e r i c a n)\n  - Maybe 🤫=c, 😂=n.\n\nGiven this, my guesses for this round are:\n- 🤥=e\n- 🤫=c\n- 😂=n\n- 🐯=a\n- 🐦=l\n- 🙄=v\n\nAnswer: 🤩=o,🤗=s,🐷=i,🐔=m,😴=p,🤥=e,🤫=c,😂=n,🐯=a,🐦=l,🙄=v","Based on the provided information and feedback from previous attempts, here's the current mapping of emojis to letters that have been confirmed correct:\n\n- 🤩 = o\n- 🤗 = s\n- 🐷 = i\n- 🐔 = m\n- 😴 = p\n- 🤥 = e\n- 🤫 = c\n\nNow, let's analyze the encoded sentence with these mappings:\n\nEncoded Sentence: 🤫🤩🤫🤩a wa🤗 an 🐷🐔😴🤩rtant 🤫🤩🐔🐔🤩🐯🐷t😂 🐷n 😴r🤥-🤫🤩l🐦🐔🙄🐷an 🐔🤥🤗🤩a🐔🤥r🐷🤫a.\n\nPartially decoded with confirmed letters:\nc o c o a wa s an i m p o r t a n t c o m m o 🐯 i t 😂 i n p r e - c o l 🐦 m 🙄 i a n m e s o a m e r i c a.\n\nFrom this, we can infer the following:\n1. \"c o c o a wa s an i m p o r t a n t\" likely starts as \"Cocoa was an important\"\n2. \"c o m m o 🐯 i t 😂\" likely is \"commo🐯it😂\" - probably \"commodity\" (so 🐯=d, 😂=y)\n3. \"p r e - c o l 🐦 m 🙄 i a n\" is \"pre-col🐦m🙄ian\" - probably \"pre-Columbian\" (so 🐦=u, 🙄=b)\n4. \"m e s o a m e r i c a\" is \"mesoamerica\"\n\nNow let's assign the new letters based on these inferences:\n- 🐯 = d\n- 😂 = y\n- 🐦 = u\n- 🙄 = b\n\nNow let's verify the full sentence with these assignments:\n\"Cocoa was an important commodity in pre-Columbian mesoamerica.\"\n\nThis makes complete sense.

The word \"🤗\" appears multiple times and is now known to be \"a\".\n2. The word \"🤗🥳\" is \"a?\" where ? is likely a vowel or common consonant following 'a'.\n3. The word \"🤗🤠e\" is \"a?e\" which could be \"are\", \"age\", \"ate\", etc. Given the context, \"are\" is plausible.\n4. The word \"😂r\" is \"?r\" where ? is likely a vowel. Common words are \"or\", \"er\", \"ar\". Given \"😂\" is not yet assigned, \"or\" is plausible (so 😂=o).\n5. The word \"🥳e\" is \"?e\". Common words are \"be\", \"me\", \"he\", \"we\", \"re\", etc. Given the context, \"be\" is plausible (so 🥳=b).\n6. The word \"🐻c🤗\" is \"?ca\". Given the context, it could be \"oca\" (as in \"local\"), \"ica\" (as in \"vica\"), but \"oca\" seems more likely (so 🐻=o). However, this conflicts with 😂=o, so perhaps 🐻=l (for \"lca\" which doesn't make sense). Alternatively, \"oca\" could be correct if 😂 is not 'o'.\n7. The word \"🤠er\" is \"?er\". If 🤠=r, then \"rer\" doesn't make sense. If 🤠=t, then \"ter\" (as in \"later\") is plausible (so 🤠=t).\n8. The word \"j😂dge\" is \"j?dge\". With 😂=o, this would be \"jodge\" which isn't a word. Alternatively, if 😂=u, it would be \"judge\" (so 😂=u).\n   - But earlier we thought 😂=o for \"or\". This suggests 😂=u is correct, and \"or\" is actually \"ur\" which is less likely. Maybe \"😂r\" is \"er\" (so 😂=e).\n   - Alternatively, \"😂r\" could be \"ar\" (so 😂=a), but 🤗=a already.\n   - Re-evaluating: if 🤗=a, then \"😂r\" is likely \"er\" (so 😂=e).\n9. If 😂=e, then \"j😂dge\" is \"jedge\" which isn't a word. So perhaps 😂=u (for \"judge\"), and \"😂r\" is \"ur\" (less common). Maybe \"😂r\" is \"or\" (so 😂=o).\n   - This is conflicting. Maybe \"j😂dge\" is \"judge\" (😂=u), and \"😂r\" is \"ur\" (slang for \"your\").\n10. The word \"f🤗ctor\" is \"factor\" (so f🤗ctor=factor). This fits with 🤗=a.\n11. The word \"t🤗le🥳t\" is \"ta?et\". If 🥳=b, then \"tabet\" isn't a word. Maybe 🥳=l (so \"talet\" ~ \"talent\"). So 🥳=l.\n12. If 🥳=l, then \"🤗🥳\" is \"al\" (as in \"also\"), and \"🤗🤠e\" is \"a?e\". If 🤠=t, then \"ate\".\n13. The word \"🤠er\" is \"?er\". If 🤠=t, then \"ter\" (as in \"later\").\n14. The word \"🐻c🤗\" is \"?ca\". If 🐻=l, then \"lca\" doesn't make sense. Maybe 🐻=o (so \"oca\" as in \"local\").\n15. The word \"osbo😂r\" is \"osbo?r\". If 😂=u, then \"osbour\" ~ \"osbourn\" (name). Maybe \"osborn\" (so 😂=o).\n    - But then \"j😂dge\" is \"jodge\" which is wrong.

Alternatively, \"author's\" if 🤠=h, 🐻=o (but 🐻≠o from feedback).\n\n   Given the feedback, let's try:\n   - 🥳 = n (since \"and\" is common and fits \"🤗🥳d\" = \"a n d\")\n   - 🤠 = m (since \"became\" fits \"bec🤗🤠e\" = \"became\")\n   - 🦆 = p (guessing \"the p factor\" for \"🦆 f🤗ctor\")\n   - 🐻 = b (guessing \"amberca's\" or similar, but unclear; could also be \"amberca's\" if 🐻=b)\n\n4. **Updated Guesses**:\n   - 🤗 = a\n   - 😂 = u\n   - 🥳 = n\n   - 🤠 = m\n   - 🦆 = p\n   - 🐻 = b\n\nNow, let's check the sentence with these guesses:\n- \"osbo😂r🥳e\" = \"osbourne\" (likely a name, e.g., \"Osbourne\")\n- \"l🤗ter\" = \"later\"\n- \"bec🤗🤠e\" = \"became\"\n- \"a judge\"\n- \"o🥳 the\" = \"on the\" (but \"of the\" is more likely; perhaps 🥳=f? But 🥳≠e and 🥳≠n is untested)\n   Wait, if 🥳=n, \"on the\" is possible, but \"of the\" is more common. Maybe 🥳=f is correct despite feedback? But feedback said 🥳≠e, not necessarily ≠f.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe 🥳=i (for \"o🥳 the\" = \"oi the\" unlikely), or 🥳=d (\"od the\" unlikely), or 🥳=h (\"oh the\" unlikely). Maybe 🥳=f is correct, and the feedback was only that 🥳≠e.\n\nGiven uncertainty, let's stick with 🥳=n for now.\n\nAnswer: 🤗=a,😂=u,🥳=n,🤠=m,🦆=p,🐻=b","Based on the provided information, let's analyze the current state:\n\n1. Correctly guessed emojis from History:\n   - 🤗 = a\n   - 😂 = u\n   - 🥳 = n\n   - 🤠 = m\n\n2. From the encoded sentence and previous guesses, we can deduce some words:\n   - \"osbo😂r🥳e\" = \"osbourne\" (likely \"osborne\")\n   - \"l🤗ter\" = \"later\"\n   - \"bec🤗🤠e\" = \"became\"\n   - \"j😂dge\" = \"judge\"\n   - \"o🥳 the\" = \"on the\"\n   - \"t🤗le🥳t\" = \"talent\"\n   - \"f🤗ctor\" = \"factor\"\n   - \"🤗🥳d\" = \"and\"\n   - \"🤗🤠er🐻c🤗's\" = \"america's\"\n\nFrom this, we can guess:\n- 🦆 = p (from \"factor\" being \"pactor\" doesn't make sense, but \"factor\" is correct, so maybe 🦆 is another letter)\nWait, looking back at History, guess 2 had 🦆=p marked as False, so it can't be p.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\"f🤗ctor\" is \"factor\", so 🦆 must be \"f\" (but guess 1 had 🦆=f marked as False)\nThis is confusing. Maybe \"f🤗ctor\" is \"pactor\"? But that's not a word.\n\nWait, maybe \"f🤗ctor\" is \"actor\", meaning 🦆 is empty? That can't be.\n\nAlternative idea: maybe \"f🤗ctor\" is \"factor\" and the 🦆 is part of another word.\n\nLooking at \"america's\", which is \"🤗🤠er🐻c🤗's\" = \"a m er ? c a's\", so missing letters are 'm', 'e', 'r', '?', 'c'\nThis would make \"america's\", so 🐻 must be 'i'\n\nAlso, \"t🤗le🥳t\" = \"t a l e n t\" = \"talent\"\n\nSo my new guesses:\n- 🐻 = i\n- 🦆 = ? Maybe 'w' for \"factor\" doesn't fit, perhaps 'd'?\n\nBut let's look at the first word: \"osbourne\" vs \"osborne\" - if it's \"osborne\", then 'u' is correct, 'r' is correct, 'n' is correct, so 'b' is correct, meaning maybe 🦆 is 'b', but 🐻 is 'i'\n\nBut in guess 2, 🐻=b was marked False, so 🐻 can't be 'b', must be 'i'\n\nSo final guesses:\n- 🤗 = a (from hint)\n- 😂 = u (from history)\n- 🥳 = n (from history)\n- 🤠 = m (from history)\n- 🐻 = i\n- 🦆 = ?\n\nFrom \"america's\", we have 'a', 'm', 'e', 'r', 'i', 'c', 'a'\nFrom \"factor\", if 🦆 is 'f', but guess 1 had it wrong, maybe it's 'w' or 'd'\n\nLooking at \"the t🤗le🥳t shows the 🦆 f🤗ctor\" = \"the talent shows the ? factor\"\nMaybe \"the talent shows the x factor\", so 🦆 = 'x'\n\nAnswer: 🤗=a,😂=u,🥳=n,🤠=m,🐻=i,🦆=x"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

We have a sentence where each letter is replaced by a unique emoji, and we know that the most frequently occurring emoji, `🥴`, corresponds to the letter `e`. \n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Encoded Sentence\nFirst, let's look at the encoded sentence and count the occurrences of each emoji to see if any stand out besides `🥴`:\n\nEncoded Sentence:\n```\n🐱🐯🐮🐨g🥴🐮🥳🥴r, 🐮🥳🥴 🐭🐨ns🐮🥴🐯🐯🐱🐮i🐨n 🐭🐨n🐮🐱ins 🐱🥺🐨u🐮 50 g🐱🐯🐱xi🥴s 🐨🥺s🥴r🤩🐱🥺🐯🥴 🐮🥳r🐨ug🥳 🐱🦆🐱🐮🥴ur 🐮🥴🐯🥴s🐭🐨p🥴.\n```\n\nCounting emojis (excluding `🥴` which we know is `e`):\n- `🐱` appears multiple times\n- `🐮` appears frequently\n- `🐨` appears several times\n- `🐯` appears a few times\n- `🥳` appears a few times\n- `🐭` appears a few times\n- `🥺` appears a few times\n- Others appear once or twice\n\n### Step 2: Identify Common Words\nGiven that `🥴` is `e`, let's look for common words in English that might fit. For example, single-letter words are likely \"a\" or \"I\". \n\nLooking at the sequence `🐮🥳🥴`, if `🥴` is `e`, then `🐮🥳e` could be \"the\" (where `🐮`=t, `🥳`=h), or \"she\" (where `🐮`=s, `🥳`=h), etc. \"The\" is more common, so let's hypothesize:\n- `🐮` = t\n- `🥳` = h\n\nNow, let's see `🐮🥳🥴` = `t h e` = \"the\", which makes sense.\n\nNext, the word `🐭🐨ns🐮🥴` with `🐮`=t, `🥴`=e: `🐭🐨nste`. Possible words ending with \"te\" could be \"state\", \"plate\", etc. Maybe \"state\" where `🐭`=s, `🐨`=a, `n`=t, but then `s a t t e` doesn't make sense. Maybe \"plate\" where `🐭`=p, `🐨`=l, `n`=a, but `p l a t e` would require `n`=a, which we can check later.\n\nAlternatively, look at `🐱🥺🐨u🐮`: with `🐮`=t, it's `🐱🥺🐨ut`. Maybe \"about\" where `🐱`=a, `🥺`=b, `🐨`=o, `u`=u, but `a b o u t` would require `u`=u, which is possible.\n\nBut earlier, if `🐮`=t, `🥳`=h, then `🐱🐯🐮🐨ge` is `🐱🐯t🐨ge`. Maybe \"string\" where `🐱`=s, `🐯`=t, `🐨`=r, `g`=i, but then `s t r i n g e` doesn't fit. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, look at `50 g🐱🐯🐱xi🥴s`: with `🥴`=e, it's `50 g🐱🐯🐱xies`. Could be \"50 grams\" where `g`=g, `🐱`=r, `🐯`=a, `x`=m, `i`=s, but that's `g r a r m e s`, which doesn't fit. Maybe \"50 grams\" where `g`=g, `🐱`=r, `🐯`=a, `x`=m, `i`=s, but then `g r a r m e s` is not \"grams\". Maybe `g` is already assigned, but we haven't assigned `g` yet.\n\nWait, `g` is a letter in the encoded text, not an emoji, so maybe `g` is a letter that's not replaced, meaning the word is \"ge\" or similar, but that's not likely. Maybe `g` is part of the emoji name, but looking back, the emojis are like `🐱`, `🐯`, etc., and `g` is separate, so perhaps `g` is actually the letter 'g' not encoded. So maybe the word is \"50 grams\" where `🐱`=r, `🐯`=a, `x`=m, `i`=s.\n\nSo tentatively:\n- `🐱` = r\n- `🐯` = a\n- `x` = m\n- `i` = s\n\nNow, `🐱🐯🐮🐨ge` = `r a t 🐨 g e`. Maybe \"rating\" where `🐨`=i, `g`=n, but `g` is a letter, not an emoji, so maybe `g` is 'g', then `r a t i g e` doesn't make sense. Maybe \"rather\" where `🐨`=h, `g`=e, but `🥴` is e, so `g` is not e. Maybe `g` is 'd', `🐨`=h, making \"rathde\", no. Maybe not.\n\nAlternative approach: look at `🐨🥺s🥴r🤩🐱🥺🐯🥴` with `🥴`=e, `🐱`=r, `🐯`=a: `🐨🥺ser🤩r🥺ae`. Maybe \"however\" where `🐨`=h, `🥺`=o, `s`=w, `e`=e, `r`=v, `🤩`=e, but `e` is already `🥴`, so `🤩` can't be e. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, `🐭🐨ns🐮🥴` with `🐮`=t, `🥴`=e: `🐭🐨nste`. Maybe \"states\" where `🐭`=s, `🐨`=t, `n`=a, `s`=e, but `s` is `i` from earlier, conflicting. Maybe not.\n\nPerhaps `🐨` is 'a', but `🐯` is 'a', so no. Maybe `🐨` is 'o'.\n\nLet's try `🐨`=o. Then `🐱🥺🐨u🐮` = `r 🥺 o u t`. Maybe \"about\" where `🥺`=b, so `r b o u t`, but first letter is `r`, not 'a'. Maybe \"robot\", but not likely. Maybe not.\n\nAlternative: look at `🐱🦆🐱🐮🥴ur` with `🐱`=r, `🐮`=t, `🥴`=e: `r 🦆 r t e u r`. Maybe \"repeater\" where `🦆`=e, but `🥴` is e, so no. Maybe \"reporter\" where `🦆`=p, `u`=o, `r`=r, but `e` is `🥴`, so `r p r t e o r`, not matching.\n\nThis is getting messy. Maybe let's list known assignments:\n- `🥴` = e\n- `🐮` = t\n- `🥳` = h\n\nNow, look for 'the' which is common. We have `🐮🥳🥴` = 'the'.\n\nNow, `🐱🐯🐮🐨ge`: starts with `🐱🐯t🐨ge`. Maybe 'state' where `🐱`=s, `🐯`=a, `🐨`=t, but `🐮` is t, so `🐨` can't be t. Maybe 'start' where `🐱`=s, `🐯`=t, but `🐮` is t, conflict. Maybe 'stake' where `🐱`=s, `🐯`=t, `🐨`=a, but `🐯` and `🐨` both a, no.\n\nAlternative: `🐱` = c, `🐯`=a, `🐨`=t: 'cat' + `ge` = 'catge', not a word. Maybe 'cater' where `g`=e, but `🥴` is e.\n\nPerhaps `🐱` = w, `🐯`=a, `🐨`=t: 'wat' + `ge` = 'watge', no.\n\nNot working. Maybe `🐱` = f, `🐯`=a, `🐨`=t: 'fat' + `ge` = 'fatge', no.\n\nAlternative approach: look at `50 g🐱🐯🐱xi🥴s`: with `🥴`=e, it's '50 g🐱🐯🐱xies'. Maybe '50 grams' where `g`=g, `🐱`=r, `🐯`=a, `x`=m, `i`=s:\n- `g` = g (letter)\n- `🐱` = r\n- `🐯` = a\n- `x` = m\n- `i` = s\n\nNow, check `🐱🐯🐮🐨ge` = `r a t 🐨 g e`. Maybe 'rating' where `🐨`=i, `g`=n, but `g` is a letter 'g', not 'n'. Maybe 'rat age', no.\n\nNot fitting. Maybe `🐱` = p, `🐯`=a, `🐨`=t: 'pat' + `ge` = 'patge', no.\n\nThis is tough. Maybe let's guess some words based on frequency.\n\nFrom the counts, `🐱` is frequent, maybe 'a' or 'i'. Let's say `🐱` = i.\n\nThen `🐱🐯🐮🐨ge` = `i 🐯 t 🐨 g e`. Maybe 'item' where `🐯`=t (but `🐮` is t), no. 'itch' no.\n\nNot working. Maybe `🐱` = s.\n\nThen `🐱🐯🐮🐨ge` = `s 🐯 t 🐨 g e`. Maybe 'state' where `🐯`=t (conflict), 'stage' where `🐯`=t, `🐨`=a, `g`=g, but `🐯` can't be t.\n\nThis is too time-consuming. Given the time, let's make some guesses based on common letters.\n\nCurrent assignments:\n- `🥴` = e\n- `🐮` = t\n- `🥳` = h\n\nLooking at `🐱🥺🐨u🐮` = `🐱🥺🐨ut`. Maybe 'about' where:\n- `🐱` = a\n- `🥺` = b\n- `🐨` = o\n- `u` = u\n\nNow, check `🐱🐯🐮🐨ge` = `a 🐯 t o g e`. Maybe 'atone' where `🐯`=t (but `🐮` is t), no. 'atoge' no.\n\nNot matching. Maybe `🐱` = i, `🥺`=s, `🐨`=a, `u`=u: 'isaut', no.\n\nGiven time, let's submit current assignments:\n\nAnswer: 🥴=e,🐮=t,🥳=h,🐱=a,🥺=b,🐨=o,u=u","Based on the provided information and feedback from the previous guess, let's analyze the encoded sentence and make new guesses.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Confirmed Letters**:\n   - 🥴 = e\n   - 🐮 = t\n   - 🥳 = h\n   - 🐱 = a\n   - 🥺 = b\n   - 🐨 = o\n\n2. **Incorrect Guess**:\n   - u = u (this was incorrect, so 'u' is not the correct letter for the emoji 'u').\n\n3. **Partial Words**:\n   - The word \"g🥴🐮🥳🥴r\" can be filled as \"g e t h e r\" → \"gether\" (likely \"together\" if we guess 'g' correctly).\n   - \"🐭🐨ns\" → \"🐭ons\" (could be \"cons\", \"mons\", etc.).\n   - \"i🐨n\" → \"ion\" (likely \"ion\" or \"ion\").\n   - \"50 g🐱🐯🐱xi🥴s\" → \"50 a🐯a xie s\" (likely \"50 a_a_xie_s\", possibly \"50 attacks\" if 🐯 = t, but 🐮 is already 't').\n\n4. **New Guesses**:\n   - From \"gether\", it seems like the word is \"together\", so 'g' is likely correct for 'g'.\n   - \"🐯\" appears frequently; possible letters: 'c', 'd', 'f', 'i', 'l', 'm', 'n', 's', etc. Given \"a🐯a\" in \"50 a🐯a xie s\", it could be \"50 attacks\" (🐯 = t, but 🐮 is already 't'), so maybe \"50 alarms\" (🐯 = l).\n   - \"🐭\" appears in \"🐭ons\"; if \"cons\", then 🐭 = c.\n   - \"🤩\" is new; could be 'd', 'f', 'i', 'm', 'n', 's', etc.\n\n### New Guesses:\n- g = g (from \"gether\" → \"together\")\n- 🐯 = l (from \"a🐯a\" → \"ala\" or \"ala\" in \"50 alarms\")\n- 🐭 = c (from \"🐭ons\" → \"cons\")\n- 🤩 = d (random guess)\n\n### Answer:\nInclude all confirmed letters and new guesses:\nAnswer: 🥴=e,🐮=t,🥳=h,🐱=a,🥺=b,🐨=o,g=g,🐯=l,🐭=c,🤩=d","Based on the provided information and feedback, let's analyze the current state of the game:\n\nCorrectly guessed emojis:\n- 🥴 = e\n- 🐮 = t\n- 🥳 = h\n- 🐱 = a\n- 🥺 = b\n- 🐨 = o\n- 🐯 = l\n- 🐭 = c\n\nIncorrect guesses:\n- u = u (false)\n- g = g (false)\n- 🤩 = d (false)\n\nNow let's look at the encoded sentence with the known substitutions:\n\"a l t o g e t h e r, t h e c o n s t e l l a t i o n c o n t a i n s a b o u t 50 g a l a x i e s o b s e r d a b l e t h r o u g h a 🦆 a t e u r t e l e s c o p e.\"\n\nFrom this, we can make some educated guesses:\n1. \"a l t o g e t h e r\" - likely \"altogether\" (so g = o, but this was marked false in history)\n   Wait, but g=o was marked false in history, so this can't be right.\n   Maybe \"a lot together\"?

The word \"psyche\" is likely \"psychic\" since 🐨=a, and \"psychic\" fits the context.\n   - \"psychic\" has 7 letters, \"psyche\" has 6, but it's possible the last letter is missing or another emoji is involved.\n   - Alternatively, \"psyche\" could be \"psychic\" with the last 'c' missing or replaced.\n\n2. The word \"c🐨se\" with 🐨=a is \"case\".\n\n3. The word \"p🐨🐶en🤔\" with 🐨=a is \"pa🐶en🤔\". This could be \"patient\" (p-a-t-i-e-n-t), so:\n   - 🐶=t\n   - 🤔=i\n\n4. The word \"bo🥺y\" could be \"body\" (b-o-d-y), so:\n   - 🥺=d\n\nNow, let's verify these guesses with other parts of the sentence:\n- \"me🤔🐨🐮🐮ic\" with 🤔=i, 🐨=a: \"meia🐮🐮ic\" → \"medical\" (m-e-d-i-c-a-l), so:\n  - 🐮=c (but 🐨=a, so this might not fit)\n  - Alternatively, \"me🤔🐨🐮🐮ic\" could be \"mechanical\" (m-e-c-h-a-n-i-c-a-l), but this is longer.\n  - Maybe \"metallic\" (m-e-t-a-l-l-i-c), but 🐶=t is already used.\n  - \"me🤔🐨🐮🐮ic\" with 🤔=i, 🐨=a: \"meia🐮🐮ic\" → \"medicinal\" (m-e-d-i-c-i-n-a-l), but this is longer.\n  - Perhaps \"metaphoric\" is too long.\n  - Maybe \"me🤔🐨🐮🐮ic\" is \"metallic\" (m-e-t-a-l-l-i-c), but 🐶=t is already used, so 🐮=l.\n\nGiven the confusion, let's try another approach:\n- \"co🐶e\" with 🐶=t: \"cote\" → likely \"code\" (c-o-d-e), so:\n  - 🐶=o (but this contradicts earlier guess 🐶=t)\n  - Alternatively, \"cote\" could be \"cute\" (c-u-t-e), but 🐶=u.\n\nThis suggests that 🐶=t may not be correct.

Here's my initial analysis:\n\n1. The word \"al🐭o\" with 🐭=s becomes \"also\", so likely 🐭=s is correct.\n2. \"a🧐🧐ea😎ed\" could be \"a__ea_ed\". Given the context, this might be \"acclaimed\" or \"awarded\". Since we have \"accla🐹med\" later, let's assume 🧐=c and 😎=i.\n3. \"ma🥵y\" could be \"many\", suggesting 🥵=n.\n4. \"h🐹🐦hly\" could be \"highly\", suggesting 🐹=i and 🐦=g.\n5. \"telev🐹🐭🐹o🥵\" with current mappings would be \"televisio🥵\" which is likely \"television\", confirming 🥵=n.\n6. \"d😎ama🐭\" would be \"diamas\" which doesn't make sense, but with 😎=i it's \"diamas\" - perhaps \"dramas\"? Maybe 😎=r.\n   Wait, earlier I thought 😎=i, but \"a🧐🧐ea😎ed\" with 🧐=c would be \"acceared\" which doesn't make sense. Maybe 😎=l?\n   \"a🧐🧐ea😎ed\" with 🧐=c and 😎=l would be \"accleaed\" - not matching. Maybe 😎=m?\n   \"a🧐🧐ea😎ed\" with 🧐=c and 😎=m would be \"accmeaed\" - no.\n   Maybe 🧐=l and 😎=c? \"alleaced\" - no.\n   Maybe 🧐=m and 😎=c? \"ammeaced\" - no.\n   Maybe the word is \"acclaimed\", so 🧐=c, 😎=l, making \"accleaed\" - close but not exact.\n   Maybe the word is \"achieved\"? Then 🧐=h, 😎=e, making \"ahheaed\" - no.\n   Maybe \"appealed\"? Then 🧐=p, 😎=e, making \"appeaed\" - close.\n   Maybe \"appeared\"? Then 🧐=p, 😎=a, making \"appaaed\" - no.\n   Maybe \"assessed\"? But 🐭=s, so \"asseesed\" - no.\n   This is tricky. Maybe focus on other words first.\n\nGiven the confusion with 😎, let's try other words:\n\"clock🐹🥵🐦\" with 🐹=i, 🥵=n, 🐦=g would be \"clocking\" which makes sense.\n\"o🤧🤧\" could be \"off\" or \"odd\", suggesting 🤧=f or d.\n\"two 🦆a🤧ta\" could be \"two da🤧ta\" or \"two fa🤧ta\". Maybe \"two facts\" suggesting 🦆=f, 🤧=c, but 🧐 might be c.\nAlternatively, \"two data\" with 🦆=d, 🤧=a.\n\"awa😎d-w🐹🥵🥵🐹🥵🐦\" with current mappings would be \"awaid-winning\" if 😎=i, but that's not a word. Maybe \"award-winning\" with 😎=r, 🐹=i, 🥵=n, 🐦=g.\nSo 😎=r seems likely.\nThen \"a🧐🧐ea😎ed\" would be \"a__ear_d\" - maybe \"appeared\" with 🧐=p.\n\"d😎ama🐭\" would be \"dramas\" which fits.\n\"o🤧🤧\" could be \"off\" with 🤧=f.\n\"two 🦆a🤧ta\" would be \"two fafta\" if 🦆=f, 🤧=f - no. Maybe \"two facts\" with 🦆=f, 🤧=c, but 🧐=p.\nAlternatively, \"two data\" with 🦆=d, 🤧=a.\n\"🐭e😎🐹al🐭\" would be \"serial🐭\" - maybe \"serials\" with 😎=r, 🐹=i.\n\"🐭e🐰 t😎a🤧🤧🐹c\" would be \"se🐰 tra🤧🤧ic\" - maybe \"series traffic\" or \"secrets traffic\"? Not sure about 🐰.\n\"lake🐭\" is \"lakes\".\n\"🐭tate\" is \"state\".\n\"o🤧\" could be \"of\" with 🤧=f.\n\"a🥵d\" is \"and\" with 🥵=n.\n\"d😎ama🐭\" is \"dramas\".\n\"ma🥵y\" is \"many\".\n\"h🐹🐦hly\" is \"highly\".\n\"accla🐹med\" is \"acclaimed\".\n\"telev🐹🐭🐹o🥵\" is \"television\".\n\"clock🐹🥵🐦\" is \"clocking\".\n\"awa😎d-w🐹🥵🥵🐹🥵🐦\" is \"award-winning\".\n\"two 🦆a🤧ta\" - if 🤧=f, maybe \"two fasta\"? Not sure. Maybe \"two fanta\" (as in Fanta drinks)? Or \"two facts\" with 🤧=c, but 🧐=p.\nAlternatively, if 🤧=d, 🦆=a, \"two adta\" - no.\nThis is tricky. Maybe 🦆=p, 🤧=a, \"two pata\" - no.\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll proceed with the mappings I'm confident about.\n\nCurrent mappings:\n🐭=s\n🐹=i\n🥵=n\n🐦=g\n😎=r\n🤧=f\n🧐=p\n🦆=? (maybe d)\n🐰=? (maybe c)\n\nNow let's look at \"two 🦆a🤧ta\":\nIf 🤧=f, then \"two 🦆afta\". Maybe \"two pata\" (Spanish for \"paw\")? Not likely.\nIf 🤧=c, then \"two 🦆acta\". Maybe \"two pacta\" (Latin for \"agreements\")? Not likely.\nAlternatively, maybe 🦆=d, 🤧=a, \"two data\" which makes sense.\nThen 🤧=a.\nBut earlier \"o🤧🤧\" would be \"oaa\" - no. Maybe \"o🤧🤧\" is \"odd\" with 🤧=d.\nThen \"two 🦆a🤧ta\" would be \"two 🦆adta\". Maybe \"two data\" with 🦆=d, 🤧=a, but then \"oaa\" is wrong.\nAlternatively, if 🤧=d, then \"two 🦆adta\" - maybe \"two data\" with 🦆=d, but then 🤧=a and d? Doesn't work.\nThis is confusing. Maybe 🤧=t, then \"two 🦆atta\" - maybe \"two pasta\" with 🦆=p.\nBut then \"o🤧🤧\" is \"ott\" - no.\nMaybe better to leave 🦆 and 🤧 for now.\n\nFinal mappings for this round:\n🐭=s\n🐹=i\n🥵=n\n🐦=g\n😎=r\n🧐=p\n🤧=? (maybe f or d)\n🦆=? \n🐰=?\n\nAnswer: 🐭=s,🐹=i,🥵=n,🐦=g,😎=r,🧐=p","Based on the provided information and the feedback from the previous guess, we know the following correct mappings:\n- 🐭 = s\n- 🐹 = i\n- 🥵 = n\n- 🐦 = g\n- 😎 = r\n- 🧐 = p\n\nNow, let's look at the encoded sentence and try to deduce more mappings:\n\n1. \"he ha🐭 al🐭o a🧐🧐ea😎ed\" → \"he has also a**ea**red\" → The word is \"appeared\", so:\n   - 🧐 = p (already known)\n   - The emoji 🧐 is 'p', so the word is \"appeared\", confirming 😎 = r (already known).\n\n2. \"i🥵 ma🥵y\" → \"in many\" → Confirms 🥵 = n (already known).\n\n3. \"hi🤧hly-acclaime**d televisio🥵\" → \"highly-acclaimed television\" → So:\n   - 🤧 = h\n   - 🥵 = n (already known)\n   - The word is \"television\", so the remaining emoji 🐭 = s (already known).\n\n4. \"drama🐭\" → \"dramas\" → Confirms 🐭 = s.\n\n5. \"such as the lakes\" → \"🐭uch a🐭 the lake🐭\" → Confirms 🐭 = s.\n\n6. \"state o🤧 play\" → \"state of play\" → So:\n   - o🤧 = of → 🤧 = f (but earlier we thought 🤧 = h, which conflicts. This suggests 🤧 could be 'f' or 'h'. But \"television\" fits with 🤧 = h, so perhaps \"state of play\" is incorrect. Maybe \"state oh play\" is not a phrase, so 🤧 = f is more likely. This contradicts the earlier guess. Maybe the word is \"state of play\", so 🤧 = f.\n\nWait, the previous guess had 🤧 unassigned, and the feedback only confirmed 🐭, 🐹, 🥵, 🐦, 😎, 🧐. So 🤧 was not confirmed. Thus, 🤧 could be 'f'.\n\n7. \"two 🦆a🤧ta\" → \"two *a**ta\" → Could be \"two facts\" or \"two acts\". \"facts\" is more likely, so:\n   - 🦆 = f\n   - 🤧 = c or another letter. But if 🤧 = f, then 🦆 cannot be f. Maybe \"two acts\":\n     - 🦆 = a\n     - 🤧 = c\n\nBut \"a🤧ta\" could be \"acts\" (🤧 = c) or \"afta\" (unlikely). So likely:\n   - 🦆 = a\n   - 🤧 = c\n\n8. \"award-wi🥵🥵i🥵g\" → \"award-winning\" → Confirms 🥵 = n, 🐦 = g.\n\n9. \"se😎ial🐭\" → \"serials\" → Confirms 😎 = r, 🐭 = s.\n\n10. \"clocki🥵🐦 o🤧🤧\" → \"clocking o**\" → Could be \"clocking off\" (if 🤧 = f) or \"clocking occ\" (unlikely). So 🤧 = f.\n\n11. \"se🐰 tra🤧🤧ic\" → \"se* traff*\" → Could be \"set traffic\" or \"sea traffic\". More likely \"set traffic\":\n   - 🐰 = t\n   - 🤧 = f (from earlier)\n\nBut \"traffic\" would require 🤧 = f, so:\n   - 🤧 = f\n   - 🐰 = t\n\nNow, let's summarize the new mappings:\n- 🦆 = a\n- 🤧 = f\n- 🐰 = t\n\nNow, let's check the encoded sentence with these mappings:\n\n\"he has also appeared in many highly-acclaimed television dramas such as the lakes, state of play and two acts award-winning serials; clocking off and set traffic.\"\n\nThis makes sense. So the new mappings are:\n- 🦆 = a\n- 🤧 = f\n- 🐰 = t\n\nNow, let's include all confirmed mappings in the answer:\n- 🐭 = s\n- 🐹 = i\n- 🥵 = n\n- 🐦 = g\n- 😎 = r\n- 🧐 = p\n- 🦆 = a\n- 🤧 = f\n- 🐰 = t\n\nAnswer: 🐭=s,🐹=i,🥵=n,🐦=g,😎=r,🧐=p,🦆=a,🤧=f,🐰=t","Based on the provided information and history, here's the analysis:\n\n1.

Possible words: \"seta\", \"sete\", \"seto\", \"sets\". Given that 'c' was incorrect, let's try 'd': \"setd\" doesn't make sense. 'h': \"seth\" is a name. 'k': \"setk\" doesn't make sense. 'l': \"setl\" doesn't make sense. 'm': \"setm\" doesn't make sense. 'o': \"seto\" is a name. 'q': \"setq\" doesn't make sense. 'u': \"setu\" doesn't make sense. 'v': \"setv\" doesn't make sense. 'w': \"setw\" doesn't make sense. 'x': \"setx\" doesn't make sense. 'y': \"sety\" doesn't make sense. 'z': \"setz\" doesn't make sense.\n3. Another approach: \"t😎a🤧🤧🐹c\" = \"trafi c\" or \"trafic\". This suggests that the last letter is 'k' (as in \"traffic\"), but 'c' was guessed as incorrect for 🐰. Maybe 🐰 is 'k'.\n\nGiven the attempts, let's try 🐰 = k.\n\nNow, let's include all correct mappings and the new guess for 🐰:\n\nAnswer: 🐭=s,🐹=i,🥵=n,🐦=g,😎=r,🧐=p,🤧=f,🦆=b,🐰=k","Based on the provided information and the history of guesses, here's the current state of the emoji-letter mappings:\n\nCorrect mappings:\n- 🐭 = s\n- 🐹 = i\n- 🥵 = n\n- 🐦 = g\n- 😎 = r\n- 🧐 = p\n- 🤧 = f\n- 🦆 = b\n\nIncorrect guesses for 🐰: t, e, c, k\n\nNow, let's analyze the encoded sentence with these mappings to deduce possible words and letters:\n\n1. \"he ha🐭 al🐭o a🧐🧐ea😎ed\" → \"he has also appraised\" (so 🐰 might be 'd', but 'd' is already taken by 🦆=b was correct, so this can't be)\n   Wait, \"appraised\" would require 🐰=d, but 🦆=b is correct, so this can't be right.

The word `m🐯🤫es` appears twice. Given `🐯` is `a`, it's `ma🤫es`. This looks like it could be \"makes\" or \"mates\". Given that \"makes\" is more common, let's assume `🤫` = `k`. So `ma🤫es` = `makes`.\n\n   - `🤫` = `k`\n\n2. Now, let's look at `m🐯te` later in the sentence. With `🐯` = `a`, it's `mate`. This could be \"mate\" or \"make\", but since we've assigned `🤫` = `k`, \"make\" would be `ma🤫e`, which isn't here. So `m🐯te` is likely \"mate\".\n\n   - This suggests `e` is at the end, but we already have `🤫` = `k`, so let's see other words.\n\n3. The word `🤓🐯🐼` appears. With `🐯` = `a`, it's `🤓a🐼`. Common short words with 'a' in the middle could be \"hat\", \"bat\", \"cat\", etc. Let's guess `🤓` = `c` and `🐼` = `t`.\n\n   - `🤓` = `c`\n   - `🐼` = `t`\n\n   So `🤓🐯🐼` = `cat`.\n\n4. Now, `🤓🥶🤫🤫e🤓t` with `🤓` = `c`, `🤫` = `k`, so `c🥶kke ct`. This looks like \"cockte\" or similar, which doesn't make sense. Maybe `🥶` = `o`? Then `cokke ct` is closer to \"cockte\" which isn't a word. Maybe `🥶` = `l`? `clkke ct` – still not clear. Maybe `🥶` = `u`? `cukke ct` – no. Maybe `🥶` = `i`? `cikke ct` – no. Hmm.\n\n   Alternatively, maybe `🐼` isn't `t`. Let's reconsider `🤓🐯🐼` = `cat`. Maybe `🐼` = `h`, then `🤓🐯🐼` = `cah` – not a word. Or `🐼` = `b`, `cab`. `cab` is a word. So `🐼` = `b`.\n\n   - `🐼` = `b`\n\n   Then `🤓🥶🤫🤫e🤓t` = `c🥶kke ct`. If `🥶` = `o`, `cokke ct` – maybe \"cobble ct\"? Not sure. Maybe `🥶` = `a`, but `🐯` is `a`. Maybe `🥶` = `u`, `cukke ct` – no. Maybe `🥶` = `i`, `cikke ct` – no.\n\n   Maybe `🤓` isn't `c`. Let's try `🤓` = `h`, then `h🐯🐼` = `hab` or `hat`. `hat` is a word, so `🐼` = `t`.\n\n   - `🤓` = `h`\n   - `🐼` = `t`\n\n   Then `🤓🥶🤫🤫e🤓t` = `h🥶kke ht`. If `🥶` = `a`, `hakke ht` – no. `🥶` = `i`, `hikke ht` – no. `🥶` = `o`, `hokke ht` – no. `🥶` = `u`, `hukke ht` – no. Maybe `🥶` = `e`, `hekke ht` – no.\n\n   Maybe `🤫` isn't `k`. Let's think differently.\n\n5. The word `m🥶st` appears at the start. Common words are \"most\", \"must\", \"mast\". `🐯` is `a`, so `a` is already taken. `most` is likely, so `🥶` = `o`.\n\n   - `🥶` = `o`\n\n   Then `m🥶st` = `most`.\n\n6. Now, `d🥶m🐷🐼🐯🐼t` with `🥶` = `o`, `🐯` = `a`, `🐼` = `t` (from `hat`), so `dom🐷ta t`. This looks like \"dominate\" or similar. Maybe `🐷` = `i`, then `domitate` – close to \"dominate\". So `🐷` = `i`.\n\n   - `🐷` = `i`\n\n   Then `d🥶m🐷🐼🐯🐼t` = `domitate` – likely \"dominate\".\n\n7. Now, `m🐯🤫es` = `ma🤫es`. With `🤫` unknown, and likely \"makes\", so `🤫` = `k`.\n\n   - `🤫` = `k`\n\n   So `ma🤫es` = `makes`.\n\n8. `🤓🐯🐼` = `hat` (from earlier).\n\n9. `🤓🥶🤫🤫e🤓t` = `hokke ht` – not making sense. Maybe `🤓` isn't `h`. Let's try `🤓` = `w`, then `w🐯🐼` = `wat` – not a word. `🤓` = `t`, `tat` – no. `🤓` = `s`, `sat` – possible. So `🤓` = `s`.\n\n   - `🤓` = `s`\n\n   Then `🤓🐯🐼` = `sat`.\n\n   And `🤓🥶🤫🤫e🤓t` = `sokke st` – maybe \"socket\"? If `e` is `c`, but `🤓` is `s`. Maybe `e` is `e`, `sokke st` – no. Maybe `🤫` = `c`, but we have `🤫` = `k`. Maybe `🤫` = `e`, but then `ma🤫es` = `maees` – no. Maybe `🤫` = `c`, `makes` would be `maees` – no. Stuck here.\n\n   Maybe `🤓🥶🤫🤫e🤓t` is \"socket\", then `s o c c e s t` – but `🤫` would be `c`, but `🤓` is `s`. Then `🤓` = `s`, `🥶` = `o`, `🤫` = `c`, `e` = `e`, `t` is `t`. So `s o c c e s t` = \"socket\".\n\n   - `🤫` = `c`\n   - `e` is `e` (assuming)\n\n   Then `ma🤫es` = `maces` – but earlier we thought \"makes\". Maybe it's \"maces\". Alternatively, maybe `🤫` is `k` and `e` is `e`, then `sokke st` – not a word. Maybe `🤫` is `k`, `e` is `t`, but `🐼` is `t`. Maybe `e` is `e`.\n\n   Maybe `m🐯🤫es` is \"mates\", then `🤫` = `t`, but `🐼` is `t`. So `🤫` can't be `t`. Maybe `🤫` = `d`, `mades` – no. `🤫` = `l`, `males` – possible. Then `🤓🥶🤫🤫e🤓t` = `s o l l e s t` = \"sollest\" – not a word. Maybe `🤫` = `m`, `mames` – no.\n\n   This is getting confusing. Maybe initial assumption `🐼` = `t` is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's list emojis and possible letters:\n\nEmojis seen: `🥶`, `🐷`, `🐼`, `🐯`, `🤫`, `🤓`, `🐦`, `🐮`, `😇`\n\nKnown:\n- `🐯` = `a`\n- `🥶` = `o` (from \"most\")\n- `🐷` = `i` (from \"dominate\")\n- `🤓` = `s` (from \"sat\")\n- `🤫` = `c` (from \"socket\")\n- `🐼` = `t` (from \"sat\" = `s a t`)\n\nNow, `m🐯🤫es` = `m a c e s` = \"maces\" – not common. Maybe `e` is `e`, `s` is `s`, `t` is `t`.\n\n`m🐯🐼🐦` = `m a t 🐦` – could be \"math\" if `🐦` = `h`.\n\n- `🐦` = `h`\n\n`🐯s` = `a s` = \"as\"\n\n`15 - 20 🐮em🐯🤫es` = `15 - 20 🐮 e m a c e s` – \"emaces\" isn't a word. Maybe `🐮` = `d`, \"demaces\" – no. `🐮` = `f`, \"femaces\" – no. `🐮` = `p`, \"pemaces\" – no. Maybe `🐮` = `y`, \"yemaces\" – no. Maybe `🐮` = `n`, \"nemaces\" – no. Maybe `🐮` = `l`, \"lemaces\" – no. Maybe `🐮` = `b`, \"bemaces\" – no. Maybe `🐮` = `v`, \"vemaces\" – no. Maybe `🐮` = `w`, \"wemaces\" – no. Maybe `e` is `e` is wrong. Maybe `e` is `i`, but `🐷` is `i`.\n\nThis is stuck. Maybe initial assignments are off.\n\nLet me try assigning `m🐯🤫es` as \"mates\", then `🤫` = `t`, but `🐼` is `t`. Can't have two emojis as `t`. So `🤫` can't be `t`.\n\nAlternative: `m🐯🤫es` = \"males\", `🤫` = `l`.\n\n- `🤫` = `l`\n\nThen `🤓🥶🤫🤫e🤓t` = `s o l l e s t` = \"sollest\" – not a word. Maybe \"sollect\" – no.\n\nMaybe `m🐯🤫es` = \"mares\", `🤫` = `r`.\n\n- `🤫` = `r`\n\nThen `🤓🥶🤫🤫e🤓t` = `s o r r e s t` = \"sorrest\" – no. Maybe \"sorest\" – but extra `r`.\n\nThis isn't working. Maybe `🤓` isn't `s`. Let's try `🤓` = `w`, then `w a t` = \"wat\" – no. `🤓` = `t`, `t a t` – no. `🤓` = `h`, `h a t` = \"hat\".\n\n- `🤓` = `h`\n- `🐼` = `t`\n\nThen `🤓🥶🤫🤫e🤓t` = `h o 🤫 🤫 e h t`. If `🤫` = `r`, `h o r r e h t` – no. `🤫` = `l`, `h o l l e h t` – no. `🤫` = `k`, `h o k k e h t` – no. `🤫` = `c`, `h o c c e h t` – no.\n\nThis is too confusing. Maybe the initial `m🥶st` isn't \"most\". Maybe \"must\", then `🥶` = `u`.\n\n- `🥶` = `u`\n\nThen `d🥶m🐷🐼🐯🐼t` = `d u m i t a t` – \"dumitat\" – no. Maybe `🐷` isn't `i`. Maybe `🐷` = `n`, \"dumnat at\" – no.\n\nThis isn't working. Maybe `m🥶st` is \"mast\", `🥶` = `a`, but `🐯` is `a`. Can't be.\n\nGiven time, let's go with initial assignments that made some sense:\n\n- `🐯` = `a`\n- `🥶` = `o`\n- `🐷` = `i`\n- `🐼` = `t`\n- `🤫` = `c`\n- `🤓` = `s`\n- `🐦` = `h`\n- `e` = `e`\n- `t` = `t`\n\nNow, let's decode parts:\n\n`the m🥶st d🥶m🐷🐼🐯🐼t m🐯🤫es 🤓🐯🐼 🤓🥶🤫🤫e🤓t 🐯s m🐯🐼🐦 🐯s 15 - 20 🐮em🐯🤫es t🥶 m🐯te 😇🐷th.`\n\nDecoded partially:\n\n`the most domitat makes sat socket as math as 15 - 20 🐮emaces to mate 😇ith.`\n\n\"domitat\" should be \"dominate\", so maybe `🐼` = `n`:\n\n- `🐼` = `n`\n\nThen `d🥶m🐷🐼🐯🐼t` = `d o m i n a n t` = \"dominant\"\n\n`m🐯🤫es` = `m a 🤫 e s` – \"makes\" if `🤫` = `k`\n\n- `🤫` = `k`\n\n`🤓🐯🐼` = `s a n` – \"san\"? Maybe `🤓` = `t`, `t a n` = \"tan\"\n\n- `🤓` = `t`\n\n`🤓🥶🤫🤫e🤓t` = `t o k k e t t` – \"tokkett\" – no. Maybe `🤓` = `w`, `w a n` = \"wan\"\n\nThis is too messy. Let's submit what we have:\n\nKnown:\n- `🐯` = `a`\n- `🥶` = `o`\n- `🐷` = `i`\n- `🐼` = `t`\n- `🤫` = `c`\n- `🤓` = `s`\n- `🐦` = `h`\n\nAnswer: 🐯=a,🥶=o,🐷=i,🐼=t,🤫=c,🤓=s,🐦=h","Based on the encoded sentence, the hint, and the feedback from the first guess, here's the updated information:\n\n- Correct guesses from History: 🐯=a, 🥶=o, 🐷=i\n- Incorrect guesses from History: 🐼≠t, 🤫≠c, 🤓≠s, 🐦≠h\n- Hint: 🐯=a\n\nNow, let's analyze the encoded sentence with the known letters:\n\"the m🥶st d🥶m🐷🐼🐯🐼t m🐯🤫es 🤓🐯🐼 🤓🥶🤫🤫e🤓t 🐯s m🐯🐼🐦 🐯s 15 - 20 🐮em🐯🤫es t🥶 m🐯te 😇🐷th.\"\n\nSubstituting known letters:\n\"the most doim🐼a🐼t ma🤫es 🤓a🐼 o🤫🤫e🤓t as ma🐼🐦 as 15 - 20 🐮ema🤫es to mate 😇ith.\"\n\nFrom this, we can make educated guesses:\n1. \"most\" is correct (🥶=o), so \"doim🐼a🐼t\" likely starts with \"do\" followed by a word. Possible: \"dominant\" (but we know 🐼≠t). Maybe \"do🐼ma🐼t\" = \"dominat\" (but missing last letter). Alternatively, \"do🐼ma🐼t\" = \"dominat\" (could be \"dominant\" if 🐼=n and last 't' is correct).\n2. \"ma🤫es\" could be \"makes\" (🤫=k), \"maces\" (🤫=c, but 🤫≠c from History), \"mates\" (but 🐯=a), \"mares\" (🤫=r).\n3. \"🤓a🐼\" could be \"sat\" (but 🐼≠t), \"san\" (if 🐼=n), \"sap\", etc.\n4. \"o🤫🤫e🤓t\" could be \"ockest\" (but 🤫≠c), \"okket\" (unlikely), \"onset\" (if 🤫=n, but 🤫≠n because 🐼 might be n), \"offer\" doesn't fit.\n5. \"as ma🐼🐦\" could be \"as man🐦\" (if 🐼=n), then \"manh\" (unlikely), \"many\" (if 🐦=y).\n6. \"🐮ema🤫es\" could be \"remakes\" (if 🐮=r, 🤫=k), \"demakes\" (if 🐮=d), etc.\n7. \"to mate 😇ith\" suggests \"with\" (😇=w).\n\nFrom \"dominant\" guess:\n- Let's assume 🐼=n (since \"dominant\" fits and 🐼≠t).\nThen \"doim🐼a🐼t\" = \"dominant\" → 🐼=n.\n\nNow check \"ma🤫es\":\nIf \"makes\" → 🤫=k.\n\n\"🤓an\" could be \"san\" (🤓=s), but 🤓≠s from History.

Maybe \"okket\" is a typo for \"packet\" or similar.\n\nNow guessing 🤓:\n\"🤓an\" – if \"fan\" → 🤓=f.\n\"foffet\" – not a word. Maybe \"ban\" → 🤓=b, \"bonnet\" (but 🤫=k).\n\nAlternatively, \"🤓an\" = \"van\" → 🤓=v.\n\"ovvet\" – not a word.\n\nGiven uncertainty, let's guess:\n🐼=n, 🤫=k, 🐦=y, 🐮=r, 😇=w.\n\nNow the sentence:\n\"the most dominant makes 🤓an o🤫🤫e🤓t as many as 15 - 20 remakes to mate with.\"\n\n\"🤓an\" could be \"ran\" (but 🐮=r), \"ban\", \"van\", etc. Maybe \"ban\" → 🤓=b.\n\"okkebt\" – not a word. Maybe \"banket\" (not English).\n\nAlternative: if 🤓=h (not in History), \"hanket\" – no.\n\nGiven time, here are the most likely guesses:\n- 🐼=n (from \"dominant\")\n- 🤫=k (from \"makes\")\n- 🐦=y (from \"many\")\n- 🐮=r (from \"remakes\")\n- 😇=w (from \"with\")\n- 🤓=? (uncertain, maybe b for \"ban\")\n\nFinal answer:\nAnswer: 🐯=a,🥶=o,🐷=i,🐼=n,🤫=k,🤓=b,🐦=y,🐮=r,😇=w","Based on the encoded sentence, the hint, and the feedback from previous attempts, here's my analysis and guess for this round:\n\n1. From the hint and history, we know:\n   - 🐯 = a (confirmed)\n   - 🥶 = o (confirmed)\n   - 🐷 = i (confirmed)\n   - 🐼 = n (confirmed in guess 2)\n   - 🐦 = h (confirmed in guess 2)\n   - 😇 = w (confirmed in guess 2)\n\n2. Looking at the encoded sentence:\n   - \"m🐯te\" could be \"mate\" (so m = m)\n   - \"😇🐷th\" could be \"with\" (so t = t)\n   - \"🤓🥶🤫🤫e🤓t\" has pattern s_o__es (likely \"scores\")\n     - So 🤓 = s, 🤫 = c, e = r\n   - \"d🥶m🐷🐼🐯🐼t\" is \"dominant\" (so d = d)\n   - \"m🐯🐼🐦\" is \"manh\" - likely \"math\" (so 🐦 = t, but this contradicts guess 2 where 🐦 was confirmed as h)\n     - Wait, guess 2 feedback showed 🐦 was correct as h, so \"manh\" is likely \"manh\" which doesn't make sense. Maybe \"many\"?\n     - Alternatively, maybe 🐦 = y (from guess 2 where it was incorrect as y, but maybe it's correct now)\n   - \"15 - 20 🐮em🐯🤫es\" is \"15-20 _emaces\" - likely \"females\" (so 🐮 = f)\n\n3. Updating based on this:\n   - 🤓 = s\n   - 🤫 = c\n   - e = r\n   - 🐮 = f\n   - m = m\n   - t = t\n   - d = d\n   - 🐦 = y (since \"manh\" didn't make sense, but \"many\" does)\n\n4. Testing \"many\":\n   - \"m🐯🐼🐦\" = \"many\" (a n y) - makes sense\n   - So 🐦 = y\n\n5. Now the sentence reads:\n   - \"the most dominant a_ _es scores as many as 15 - 20 females to a_te with\"\n   - Likely \"the most dominant a_ _es scores as many as 15 - 20 females to mate with\"\n   - Missing words could be \"alpha\" (so 🐷 = i, 🐼 = n, but we have 🐼 = n already)\n   - \"a_ _es\" could be \"aces\" (but we have 🤫 = c), or \"ages\" (but e = r)\n   - Maybe \"a_ _es\" is \"ants\" (but t is already taken)\n   -

From the hint and history, we know:\n   - 🐯 = a (confirmed)\n   - 🥶 = o (confirmed)\n   - 🐷 = i (confirmed)\n   - 🐼 = n (confirmed in guess 2)\n   - 🐦 = h (confirmed in guess 2)\n   - 😇 = w (confirmed in guess 2)\n\n2. Looking at the word \"m🐯te\" with known letters:\n   - m a t e → likely \"mate\"\n\n3. Looking at \"🤓🥶🤫🤫e🤓t\":\n   - s o c c e s t → likely \"soccest\" but this doesn't make sense. Maybe \"soccer\" is intended, suggesting:\n     - 🤓 = s\n     - 🤫 = c\n     - e is already e\n     - t is t (but we have 🐼=n, so this suggests the last character is n, not t)\n\nWait, this contradicts with earlier assignments. Maybe \"soccest\" is incorrect. Let me look at other words.\n\n4. \"m🥶st\" = m o s t → \"most\" (so 🐼 = n is correct, and s is likely 🤓)\n\n5. \"d🥶m🐷🐼\" = d o m i n → \"domin\" (likely \"domain\" or \"domino\", but we have 🐼=n, so maybe \"domino\" suggesting:\n   - 🤫 = n (but 🐼 is already n)\n   This is conflicting. Maybe \"domino\" is not correct.\n\n6. \"m🐯🤫es\" = m a c e s → \"maces\" (if 🤫=c)\n\n7. \"🤓🐯🐼\" = s a n → \"san\" (could be \"san\" as in Spanish)\n\n8. \"m🐯🐼🐦\" = m a n h → \"manh\" (could be \"manh\" as in Vietnamese, but likely incomplete)\n\nGiven the feedback from guess 2:\n- 🤫 was guessed as 'k' but was False, so 🤫 is not 'k'\n- 🤓 was guessed as 'b' but was False, so 🤓 is not 'b'\n- 🐮 was guessed as 'r' but was False, so 🐮 is not 'r'\n\nFrom guess 1:\n- 🤓 was guessed as 's' but feedback was False, so 🤓 is not 's'\nWait, this contradicts my earlier assumption. So 🤓 is not 's'.\n\nAlternative approach:\nGiven that \"m🥶st\" is \"most\", and 🥶=o, then:\n- m o s t → so the 3rd character is 's', which is 🐼, but 🐼=n from guess 2 feedback. This is a contradiction.\n\nWait, in guess 1, 🐼 was guessed as 't' but feedback was False, so 🐼 is not 't'.\nIn guess 2, 🐼 was guessed as 'n' and feedback was True, so 🐼 = n.\n\nBut \"most\" would require 🐼 = s, which contradicts 🐼 = n. So \"m🥶st\" cannot be \"most\". Maybe \"moat\" or \"moon\" but doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative: \"m🥶st\" = m o n t → \"mont\" (as in \"mont\" French for mountain), but not common.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll proceed with the confirmed letters and make new guesses for unconfirmed emojis:\n\nConfirmed:\n- 🐯 = a\n- 🥶 = o\n- 🐷 = i\n- 🐼 = n\n- 🐦 = h\n- 😇 = w\n\nNew guesses:\n- 🤓 = s (even though guess 1 feedback said False, maybe it was a different emoji)\n- 🤫 = c\n- 🐮 = l\n- e = e (from \"mate\")\n- t = t (from context)\n\nAnswer: 🐯=a,🥶=o,🐷=i,🐼=n,🤫=c,🤓=s,🐦=h,🐮=l,😇=w,e=e,t=t","Based on the provided information and feedback from previous attempts, here's my analysis and answer for the current round:\n\n1.

From the hint and feedback, we know:\n   - 😇 = e (correct)\n   - 🥶 = r (correct)\n   - 🤩 = h (correct)\n   - 👽 = p (correct)\n   - 🥴 ≠ n (from feedback)\n   - 🐸 ≠ a (from feedback)\n\n2. Looking at the word \"su🥴s\" which is 4 letters ending with 's' and has 'e' as the second letter (s😇s), possible words could be \"sues\" or \"sets\". Since 🥴 ≠ n, \"suns\" is ruled out. \"Sues\" seems more likely.\n\n3. In \"c🙄nc😇nt🥶at🤮🙄n\", we know:\n   - c e n c e n t r a t i o n (but with emojis)\n   - This suggests 🙄 = i and 🤮 = o\n\n4. In \"maut🤩aus😇n\", we know 🤩 = h, so \"mauthausen\" (a concentration camp), confirming 🤮 = o.\n\n5. \"600 🥺😇ws\" likely \"600 Jews\" (🥺 = j)\n\n6. \"n🐼😇🥴🥶ua🥶🐷\" with 🥴≠n, could be \"neuengamme\" (another camp), suggesting:\n   - 🐼 = n\n   - 🥴 = u\n   - 🐷 = m\n\n7. \"cam👽s\" = \"camps\" (already known 👽 = p)\n\n8. \"wal🐸\" could be \"wald\" (🐸 = d)\n\n9. \"an🐸\" could be \"and\" (🐸 = d)\n\n10. \"s😇nt\" = \"sent\" (already known 😇 = e)\n\n11. \"t🙄\" = \"ti\" or \"to\", but we have 🤮 = o, so likely \"to\" (🙄 = o)\n\nBut wait, this contradicts earlier assumption that 🤮 = o and 🙄 = i. Maybe:\n- \"concentration\" is \"concentrat🤮🙄n\" with 🤮 = i and 🙄 = o\n\nBut \"mauthausen\" would then need 🤮 = a, which contradicts. Maybe better:\n- 🤮 = i\n- 🙄 = o\n- Then \"concentration\" is \"concentratioon\" which is wrong.\n\nAlternative:\nMaybe 🤮 = o and 🙄 = i, making \"concentration\" correct, and \"to\" would be \"t🙄\" = \"ti\" which is wrong. Maybe \"t🙄\" is \"to\" with 🙄 = o, but then \"concentration\" would be \"concentrat🤮on\" needing 🤮 = i.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe better to stick with initial assumption:\n- 🤮 = o\n- 🙄 = i\n- Then \"t🙄\" = \"ti\" which might be short for \"Titanic\" or similar, but doesn't fit context.\n\nAlternative approach: \"n🐼😇🥴🥶ua🥶🐷\" is likely \"neuengamme\":\n- n 🐼 e 🥴 🥶 u a 🥶 🐷\n- n ? e ? r u a r ?\n- \"neuengamme\" would require:\n  - 🐼 = u\n  - 🥴 = e (but 😇 is already e)\n  - So maybe not.\n\nGiven time, here's my best guess with current info:\n\nAnswer: 😇=e,🥶=r,🤩=h,👽=p,🥺=j,🐼=n,🥴=u,🐷=m,🐸=d,🤮=o,🙄=i","Based on the encoded sentence, the hint, and the feedback from previous attempts, here's my analysis and guess for this round:\n\n1.

Here's the encoded sentence again for reference:\n\n🧐🤓 1265, 🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓 🥳🐷 🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶, 6🥶🤖 🐷🦆🐶l 🐨😴 l🐷🧐c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶 🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓🐷🥳 🥶🤖🐷 😴🧐🐶🤭🥶 🐷l🐷c🥶🐷🥳 🦉🦆🐶l🧐🦆🐮🐷🤓🥶.\n\n### Observations:\n1. 🐷 appears frequently and is given as 'e'.\n2. The word \"🐷🦆🐶l\" starts with 'e' (from 🐷=e). Common English words starting with 'e' and of length 4 could be \"each\", \"earl\", \"east\", etc. Let's guess \"each\" for this word, which would imply:\n   - 🐷=e\n   - 🦆=a\n   - 🐶=c\n   - l=h\n\n3. Now, let's look at \"l🐷🧐c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶\". We know l=h, 🐷=e, 🐶=c, so this becomes \"h🧐ce🤭🥶ec\". This looks like it could be \"hence\" or \"hance\". \"Hence\" is more common, so let's guess:\n   - 🧐=n\n   - 🤭= (not sure yet)\n   - 🥶= (not sure yet)\n\n4. The word \"🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓\" starts with 🤭, then n (from 🧐=n). Possible words could be \"under\", \"until\", etc. Let's guess \"under\":\n   - 🤭=u\n   - 🐮=d\n   - 🐨=r\n   - 🤓= (not sure yet)\n\n5. Now, let's look at \"🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶\" which is \"dr🤓🥶😴rc🥶\". This could be \"dragon\" if:\n   - 🤓=a\n   - 🥶=g\n   - 😴=o\n\n6. Let's check \"🥳🐷\" which is \"🥳e\". Common 2-letter words ending with 'e' are \"be\", \"me\", \"we\", etc. Let's guess \"we\":\n   - 🥳=w\n\n7. Now, \"🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓🐷🥳\" is \"u🐱ddraew\". This doesn't make sense, so maybe our earlier guesses are off. Perhaps \"under\" is incorrect. Let's try another approach.\n\n### Alternative Approach:\nGiven 🐷=e, let's look at \"🐷l🐷c🥶🐷🥳\" which is \"elec🥶ew\". This could be \"electew\" or similar. Maybe \"electee\":\n   - l=l\n   - c=t\n   - 🥶=e\n   - 🥳= (but this contradicts earlier guess of 🥳=w)\n\nThis seems inconsistent. Let's try another word: \"🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶\" is \"🐮🐨🤓e😴🐨ce\". If this is \"dragon\":\n   - 🐮=d\n   - 🐨=r\n   - 🤓=a\n   - 🥶=g\n   - 😴=o\n   - 🐶=c\n\nNow, \"🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓\" is \"🤭ndra\". Maybe \"andra\" is part of a name, but not common. Alternatively, \"undr\" could be \"under\":\n   - 🤭=u\n\nNow, \"🥳e\" could be \"we\":\n   - 🥳=w\n\nNow, \"u🐱ddraew\" is unclear. Maybe \"undrawew\" doesn't make sense. Perhaps \"undrapew\" is not a word. Maybe \"undress\":\n   - 🤭=u\n   - 🐱=s\n   - 🐮=d\n   - 🐨=r\n   - 🤓=e\n   - 🐷=e\n   - 🥳=s\n\nBut this contradicts 🤓=a earlier. Maybe 🤓 is 'e' and 🥶 is 'a'.\n\n### Final Guesses:\nGiven the complexity, here are some likely mappings based on common words:\n- 🐷=e\n- 🦆=a\n- 🐶=c\n- l=h\n- 🧐=n\n- 🤭=u\n- 🐮=d\n- 🐨=r\n- 🤓=a\n- 🥶=g\n- 😴=o\n- 🥳=w\n- 🐱=s\n\nNow, let's check \"🐷🦆🐶l\" = \"each\" (e a c h), which fits.\n\"l🐷🧐c🐷🤭🥶🐷🐶\" = \"hence\" (h e n t e u g e c) doesn't fit, so maybe 🥶 is not 'g'. Let's try 🥶=m:\n- \"hence\" would require 🥶=m, but \"h e n c e u m e c\" doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting inconsistent. For now, let's submit the most consistent guesses:\n\nAnswer: 🐷=e,🦆=a,🐶=c,l=h,🧐=n,🤭=u,🐮=d,🐨=r,🤓=a,🥶=g,😴=o,🥳=w,🐱=s","Based on the feedback from the first guess, we know that:\n- Correct: 🐷=e, 🦆=a\n- Incorrect: All other guesses from Attempt 1 (🐶, l, 🧐, 🤭, 🐮, 🐨, 🤓, 🥶, 😴, 🥳, 🐱)\n\nNow, let's analyze the encoded sentence with the known correct mappings:\n- 🐷=e, 🦆=a\n\nEncoded Sentence with known mappings:\n🧐🤓 1265, 🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓 🥳e 🐮🐨🤓🥶😴🐨🐶🥶, 6🥶🤖 e a🐶l 🐨😴 le🧐c e🤭🥶e🐶 🤭🐱🐮🐮🐨🤓e🥳 🥶🤖e 😴🧐🐶🤭🥶 el ec🥶e🥳 🦉a🐶l🧐a🐮e🤓🥶.\n\nFrom the first word \"🧐🤓 1265\", it's likely a name or title followed by a number. Given that 🤓 was guessed as 'a' in Attempt 1 but was incorrect, let's try a different approach.\n\nLooking at the word \"🥳e\" (second word in the second part), with 🥳 guessed as 'w' in Attempt 1 but incorrect, and knowing it's a 2-letter word ending with 'e', possible words: \"be\", \"he\", \"me\", \"we\", \"se\", etc. Let's try 🥳=w (though it was incorrect before, maybe another common letter).\n\nFrom the word \"e a🐶l\", likely \"each\" or \"earl\". Let's try 🐶=h, l=d.\n\nFrom \"le🧐c\", with l=d, it could be \"d🧐c\" like \"dance\", \"dice\", etc. Let's try 🧐=i.\n\nFrom \"e🤭🥶e🐶\", with 🐶=h, it could be \"e🤭🥶eh\". Maybe \"enough\" (but length doesn't match), or \"either\" (but needs 6 letters). Maybe 🤭=n, 🥶=g.\n\nBut let's try these and see:\n\nNew guesses:\n- 🐶=h\n- l=d\n- 🧐=i\n- 🤭=n\n- 🥶=g\n- 🥳=w\n\nNow check \"wi e\" -> \"we e\" doesn't make sense, so 🥳=w is likely wrong. Maybe 🥳=b (\"be\").\n\nLet me try:\nAnswer: 🐷=e,🦆=a,🐶=h,l=d,🧐=i,🤭=n,🥶=g,🥳=b,🐮=m,🐨=r,🤓=s,😴=o,🐱=c,🤖=y,🦉=f","Let's analyze the given information step by step to make our next guess.\n\n### Current Known Information:\n1. Correct guesses from previous attempts:\n   - 🐷 = e (from hint)\n   - 🦆 = a (from both attempts)\n   - 🧐 = i (from attempt 2)\n   - 🐮 = m (from attempt 2)\n\n2. Incorrect guesses from previous attempts:\n   - 🐶 was guessed as 'c' and 'h' (both wrong)\n   - l was guessed as 'h' and 'd' (both wrong)\n   - 🤭 was guessed as 'u' and 'n' (both wrong)\n   - 🐨 was guessed as 'r' (wrong)\n   - 🤓 was guessed as 'a' and 's' (both wrong)\n   - 🥶 was guessed as 'g' (wrong)\n   - 😴 was guessed as 'o' (wrong)\n   - 🥳 was guessed as 'w' and 'b' (both wrong)\n   - 🐱 was guessed as 's' and 'c' (both wrong)\n   - 🤖 was guessed as 'y' (wrong)\n   - 🦉 was guessed as 'f' (wrong)\n\n### Analyzing the Encoded Sentence:\nThe encoded sentence starts with \"🧐🤓 1265\", which likely translates to \"i[?] 1265\". Since 🤓 was guessed as 'a' and 's' before (both wrong), possible letters could be 'n', 't', etc.\n\nLooking at \"🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓\" (from attempt 2: 🤭=n, 🧐=i, 🐮=m, 🐨=r, 🤓=s → \"n imrs\" which was wrong). Maybe \"university\"? But that's too long. Alternatively, \"initial\"?\n\nAnother segment: \"🐷🦆🐶l\" = \"ea[?][?]\". Could this be \"each\"? Then 🐶 = c, l = h.\n\nLet's try these new guesses.\n\n### New Guesses:\n- 🐶 = c\n- l = h\n- 🤭 = u (from attempt 1, but was wrong then; maybe 'o'?)\n- 🐨 = r (from attempt 1, but was wrong then; maybe 'n'?)\n- 🤓 = t\n- 🥶 = s\n- 😴 = o\n- 🥳 = w\n- 🐱 = s (already wrong twice, maybe 'l'?)\n- 🤖 = y\n- 🦉 = f\n\nBut let's try to be consistent with words we can guess:\n\"🐷🦆🐶l\" = \"each\" → 🐶 = c, l = h.\n\"🤭🧐🐮🐨🤓\" = \"university\"? No, but maybe \"initial\"? Then:\n- 🤭 = i (but 🧐 is already i)\nAlternative: \"minimum\"? But 🐮 is m, so \"mim[?][?]m\" doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the confusion, let's try a simpler approach with the new guesses for 🐶 and l.\n\n### Final Guess for This Round:\n- 🐷 = e (hint)\n- 🦆 = a (from history)\n- 🐶 = c\n- l = h\n- 🧐 = i (from history)\n- 🤭 = o\n- 🥶 = s\n- 🥳 = w\n- 🐮 = m (from history)\n- 🐨 = r\n- 🤓 = t\n- 😴 = o\n- 🐱 = l\n- 🤖 = y\n- 🦉 = f\n\nAnswer: 🐷=e,🦆=a,🐶=c,l=h,🧐=i,🤭=o,🥶=s,🥳=w,🐮=m,🐨=r,🤓=t,😴=o,🐱=l,🤖=y,🦉=f","Based on the history and feedback provided, here's the analysis:\n\n1.

From the second guess:\n   - 🐶 is not 'h'\n   - l is not 'd'\n   - 🤭 is not 'n'\n   - 🥶 is not 'g'\n   - 🥳 is not 'b'\n   - 🐨 is not 'r'\n   - 🤓 is not 's'\n   - 😴 is not 'o'\n   - 🐱 is not 'c'\n   - 🤖 is not 'y'\n   - 🦉 is not 'f'\n\n4.

Given the $750.00, it's likely \"peso\".\n\n4. The first word \"🐸🤑🥺🥺🐻😈\" with known letters becomes \"🐸ell🐻😈\".

Given the length (5 letters), \"that\" fits better (since \"this\" is 4 letters). Let's assume 🐼=h:\n   - \"tahh\" → \"that\" would require 🐼=h, a=h (but 'a' is already a letter), so this doesn't work. Maybe \"tahh\" is \"this\"? No, length mismatch. Alternatively, \"ta🐼🐼\" could be \"their\" (but length 5). Maybe \"there\"? Length 5: \"there\" → t h e r e, so 🐼=h, a=e, but 'a' is already a letter. Not matching. Maybe \"these\"? Length 5: t h e s e → 🐼=h, a=e. But 'a' is already a letter, so this is conflicting. Perhaps \"those\"? Length 5: t h o s e → 🐼=h, a=o. Let's try 🐼=h, a=o:\n   - \"tahh\" → \"tohh\" (doesn't make sense). Maybe \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"tiger\"? Unlikely. Alternatively, \"ta🐼🐼\" could be \"taken\" or \"tales\". Not obvious. Let's try another approach.\n\n2. \"sno🐶\" appears twice. Likely a common word like \"snow\" (if 🐶=w) or \"snob\" (less likely). Let's assume 🐶=w:\n   - \"snow\" fits well.\n\n3. \"the\" is a common word. We see \"the\" in the text already (from 😍=t and 'h' and 'e' are visible). So no new info here.\n\n4. \"to\" is also visible (\"to sub🐦it\").\n\n5. \"😈orce🐸\" could be \"force\" if 😈=f and 🐸=c:\n   - \"😈orce🐸\" → \"force\" would require 😈=f, 🐸=c.\n\nLet's assume:\n- 😈=f\n- 🐸=c\n\nNow replace these:\n- \"ta🐼🐼 ceatc a🐷 snow (5: 20) ta🐼🐼 force snow to sub🐦it with the ta🐼🐼🐦ission.\"\n\nNow \"ceatc\" is likely \"catch\" or \"cease\". \"catch\" would require 🐷=a, but 'a' is already a letter. \"cease\" would require 🐷=s, e is already known. So 🐷=s:\n- \"ceatc\" → \"cease\" (if 🐷=s).\n\nNow replace 🐷=s:\n- \"ta🐼🐼 cease snow (5: 20) ta🐼🐼 force snow to sub🐦it with the ta🐼🐼🐦ission.\"\n\nNow \"ta🐼🐼\" is likely \"these\" or \"those\". Let's assume 🐼=h:\n- \"tahh\" → \"thhh\" (doesn't make sense). Maybe 🐼=h is incorrect. Alternatively, if 🐼=h and a=e:\n   - \"ta🐼🐼\" → \"tehh\" → \"teach\"? Unlikely. Maybe \"their\" (but 'a' is already a letter). Not matching.\n\nAlternative approach: \"sub🐦it\" is likely \"submit\" (if 🐦=m):\n- \"submit\" → 🐦=m.\n\nNow replace 🐦=m:\n- \"ta🐼🐼 cease snow (5: 20) ta🐼🐼 force snow to submit with the ta🐼🐼mission.\"\n\n\"ta🐼🐼mission\" is likely \"transmission\" or \"submission\". \"submission\" would require \"ta🐼🐼\" = \"sub\", but length mismatch. \"transmission\" would require \"ta🐼🐼\" = \"tran\":\n   - \"ta🐼🐼\" → \"tran\" → length 5, but \"tran\" is 4 letters. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, \"ta🐼🐼mission\" could be \"transmission\" if \"ta🐼🐼\" = \"trans\":\n   - \"ta🐼🐼\" → \"trans\" → length 5: t a 🐼 🐼 → if 🐼=r, a=n:\n      - \"ta🐼🐼\" → \"t n r r\" → \"tnrr\" doesn't match \"trans\". Maybe 🐼=r, a=a (but 'a' is already a letter). Not working.\n\nAlternative guess: \"ta🐼🐼\" = \"these\":\n   - \"ta🐼🐼\" → \"these\" → t a 🐼 🐼 → if 🐼=h, a=e:\n      - \"t e h h\" → \"tehh\" ≠ \"these\". Doesn't work.\n\nAlternative: \"ta🐼🐼\" = \"those\":\n   - \"t a 🐼 🐼\" → \"t o h h\" → \"tohh\" ≠ \"those\". Doesn't work.\n\nAlternative: \"ta🐼🐼\" = \"their\":\n   - \"t a 🐼 🐼\" → \"t h e i\" → length 5: \"t h e i r\" → 🐼=h, a=e:\n      - \"t e h h\" → \"tehh\" ≠ \"their\". Doesn't work.\n\nThis path seems stuck. Let's try another word: \"force\" is already decoded as \"force\" (😈=f, 🐸=c).\n\nNow \"ta🐼🐼\" is likely \"the\" + something, but length 5. Maybe \"the + two letters\". Not obvious.\n\nAlternative: Look at \"with the ta🐼🐼mission\":\n   - \"with the ta🐼🐼mission\" → could be \"with the transmission\":\n      - \"ta🐼🐼mission\" → \"transmission\" → \"ta🐼🐼\" = \"trans\":\n         - \"ta🐼🐼\" → \"trans\" → t a 🐼 🐼 → if 🐼=r, a=n:\n            - \"t n r r\" → \"tnrr\" ≠ \"trans\". Doesn't work.\n\nAlternative: \"ta🐼🐼\" = \"tiger\":\n   - \"t a 🐼 🐼\" → \"t i g e\" → length 5: \"t i g e r\" → 🐼=g, a=i:\n      - \"t i g g\" → \"tigg\" ≠ \"tiger\". Doesn't work.\n\nAlternative: \"ta🐼🐼\" = \"taken\":\n   - \"t a 🐼 🐼\" → \"t a k e\" → length 5: \"t a k e n\" → 🐼=k, a=a:\n      - \"t a k k\" → \"takk\" ≠ \"taken\". Doesn't work.\n\nThis is challenging. Maybe \"ta🐼🐼\" = \"tales\":\n   - \"t a 🐼 🐼\" → \"t a l e\" → length 5: \"t a l e s\" → 🐼=l, a=a:\n      - \"t a l l\" → \"tall\" ≠ \"tales\". Doesn't work.\n\nGiven the difficulty, let's guess based on the most likely assignments:\n- 😍=t (given)\n- 🐶=w (from \"snow\")\n- 😈=f (from \"force\")\n- 🐸=c (from \"force\")\n- 🐷=s (from \"cease\")\n- 🐦=m (from \"submit\")\n\nNow guess:\n- \"ta🐼🐼\" is still unclear. Maybe 🐼=h (from \"the\" pattern):\n   - \"ta🐼🐼\" → \"tahh\" → could be \"tahh\" is \"tahh\" (not matching any word). Maybe incorrect.\n\nAlternative: Maybe 🐼=r:\n   - \"ta🐼🐼\" → \"tarr\" → could be \"tarry\" (but length mismatch). Not helpful.\n\nGiven time constraints, here are the most plausible guesses:\n- 😍=t (given)\n- 🐶=w\n- 😈=f\n- 🐸=c\n- 🐷=s\n- 🐦=m\n- 🐼=h (tentative)\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐶=w,😈=f,🐸=c,🐷=s,🐦=m,🐼=h","Based on the encoded sentence, the hint, and the feedback from the previous guess, let's analyze the information:\n\n1. **Hint and Correct Guesses from History**:\n   - 😍 = t (correct)\n   - 🐶 = w (correct)\n   - 😈 = f (correct)\n   - 🐦 = m (correct)\n\n2. **Incorrect Guesses from History**:\n   - 🐸 ≠ c\n   - 🐷 ≠ s\n   - 🐼 ≠ h\n\n3. **Encoded Sentence Breakdown**:\n   - The encoded sentence is: \"😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission.\"\n   - With known emojis replaced: \"ta🐼🐼 🐸efeat🐸 a🐷 snow (5: 20) ta🐼🐼 force🐸 snow to subm🐦it wi🐦h the ta🐼🐼mission.\"\n\n4. **Possible Words**:\n   - \"ta🐼🐼\" is likely \"that\" (since \"ta🐼🐼mission\" could be \"the mission\" or \"that mission\", but \"the mission\" fits better with \"ta🐼🐼\" = \"the\").\n     - So, 🐼 = h (but this was marked incorrect in History, so 🐼 ≠ h).\n     - Alternatively, \"ta🐼🐼\" could be \"this\" (🐼 = i), but \"this\" doesn't fit well with \"this mission\".\n     - Another possibility is \"ta🐼🐼\" = \"the\" (🐼 = e), but \"the\" is already represented by 😍 = t, so this is unlikely.\n     - Maybe \"ta🐼🐼\" = \"their\" (🐼 = h), but again 🐼 ≠ h.\n     - Alternatively, \"ta🐼🐼\" = \"these\" (🐼 = e), but \"these mission\" doesn't make sense.\n     - Maybe \"ta🐼🐼\" = \"those\" (🐼 = o), but \"those mission\" is awkward.\n     - Most likely, \"ta🐼🐼\" = \"the\" (🐼 = h), but since 🐼 ≠ h, this is confusing.

Alternatively, \"a🐷\" = \"at\" (🐷 = t), but 😍 = t. Maybe \"a🐷\" = \"an\" (🐷 = n).\n   - \"🐸efeat🐸\" = \"defeatd\" if 🐸 = d, but this should be \"defeated\". So 🐸 = d seems correct.\n\n5. **Revisiting 🐼**:\n   - If \"ta🐼🐼\" = \"the\", then 🐼 = h, but this was marked incorrect. Maybe 🐼 = e (but \"tee\" doesn't make sense).\n   - Alternatively, \"ta🐼🐼\" = \"that\" (🐼 = a), but \"taa\" doesn't fit.\n   - Maybe \"ta🐼🐼\" = \"this\" (🐼 = i), but \"tiis\" doesn't fit.\n   - This is confusing; perhaps the feedback was incorrect for 🐼.\n\n6. **Updated Guesses**:\n   - From \"force🐸\" = \"forced\", 🐸 = d.\n   - From \"a🐷\", if not \"as\" or \"at\", maybe \"an\" (🐷 = n).\n   - From \"ta🐼🐼\", if not \"the\", maybe \"their\" (🐼 = h), but 🐼 ≠ h. Alternatively, \"ta🐼🐼\" = \"these\" (🐼 = e), but \"tese\" doesn't fit.\n   - Maybe \"ta🐼🐼\" = \"those\" (🐼 = o), but \"taoo\" doesn't fit.\n   - This is tricky; perhaps 🐼 = r (\"tarr\" doesn't fit).\n\nGiven the confusion with 🐼, let's focus on the clear ones:\n- 😍 = t\n- 🐶 = w\n- 😈 = f\n- 🐦 = m\n- 🐸 = d\n- 🐷 = n (from \"a🐷\" = \"an\")\n- 🐼 is unclear; perhaps 🐼 = o (\"taoo\" doesn't fit), but no better guess.\n\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐶=w,😈=f,🐸=d,🐷=n,🐦=m,🐼=o","Based on the encoded sentence, the hint, and the history of guesses, here's the analysis:\n\n1. **Hint and Correct Guesses from History**:\n   - 😍 = t (given as hint and confirmed in both guesses)\n   - 🐶 = w (confirmed in both guesses)\n   - 😈 = f (confirmed in both guesses)\n   - 🐦 = m (confirmed in both guesses)\n   - From Guess 2: 🐸 = d (confirmed)\n\n2. **Incorrect or Unconfirmed Guesses**:\n   - From Guess 1: 🐷 = s and 🐼 = h were incorrect.\n   - From Guess 2: 🐷 = n was incorrect, and 🐼 = o was incorrect.\n\n3. **Encoded Sentence Analysis**:\n   - The encoded sentence starts with \"😍a🐼🐼\" which is \"ta🐼🐼\". Given that 🐼 was guessed as 'h' and 'o' before and both were incorrect, let's consider other common letters for double letters after 'ta'. Possible words could be \"tall\", \"tall\", \"tamm\", etc., but likely \"tall\" (so 🐼 = l).\n   - \"sno🐶\" is \"snow\" (🐶 = w is confirmed), so \"sno\" is \"sno\". This suggests 🐷 could be 'w', but 🐶 is already 'w'. Maybe 'n' is already assigned elsewhere, but from Guess 2, 🐷 = n was incorrect. Next likely is 's' (but Guess 1 🐷 = s was incorrect). Maybe 'r' or 'k'. Given \"sub🐦i😍\" is \"submi t\", likely \"submit\", so 🐦 = m is confirmed, and the word is \"submit\", meaning the missing letter is 'b'. So perhaps 🐷 = b.\n   - \"😍a🐼🐼\" is \"tall\" (🐼 = l), \"😈orce🐸\" is \"forced\" (😈 = f, 🐸 = d), \"sno🐶\" is \"snow\", \"😍o\" is \"to\", \"sub🐦i😍\" is \"submit\", \"🐶i😍h\" is \"with\", \"😍he\" is \"the\", \"😍a🐼🐼🐦ission\" is \"tallmission\" which doesn't make sense, likely \"transmission\" (so 🐼 = r, 🐦 = a, but 🐦 is already 'm'). Maybe \"transmission\" is not correct. Alternatively, \"tallmission\" could be \"transmission\" if 🐼 = r and 🐦 = a, but 🐦 is 'm'. Maybe \"transmission\" is not the word. Alternatively, \"tallmission\" could be \"tall mission\", but that seems less likely. Maybe 🐼 = r is correct, and \"tall\" is actually \"tar\" (but \"tar\" is a word, but \"tar tar\" seems odd). Maybe \"tara\" or similar. This is confusing.\n\n4. **Re-evaluating 🐼**:\n   - If \"😍a🐼🐼\" is \"ta🐼🐼\" and likely \"tall\", then 🐼 = l.\n   - Then \"😍a🐼🐼🐦ission\" is \"tallmission\", which is likely \"transmission\" (but 🐦 is 'm'), so this doesn't fit. Maybe \"tall mission\".\n   - Alternatively, if 🐼 = r, then \"tarr\" or \"tar\". \"tar\" is possible, but \"tar tar\" is odd. Maybe \"taro\" or similar. Not sure.\n\n5. **Alternative Approach**:\n   - From Guess 2, 🐸 = d is correct, so \"😈orce🐸\" is \"forced\".\n   - \"😍o\" is \"to\".\n   - \"sub🐦i😍\" is \"submit\" (🐦 = m).\n   - \"🐶i😍h\" is \"with\".\n   - \"😍he\" is \"the\".\n   - \"sno🐶\" is \"snow\".\n   - \"😍a🐼🐼\" is likely \"tall\" (🐼 = l).\n   - Then \"😍a🐼🐼🐦ission\" is \"tallmission\", which is probably \"tall mission\".\n\n6. **Final Guesses**:\n   - 🐼 = l (from \"tall\")\n   - 🐷 = b (from \"submit\" needing 'b')\n   - Other emojis are already correctly guessed or not present in the current guess.\n\nGiven this, the current guess is:\n- 😍 = t (hint)\n- 🐶 = w (from history)\n- 😈 = f (from history)\n- 🐸 = d (from history)\n- 🐦 = m (from history)\n- 🐼 = l (new guess)\n- 🐷 = b (new guess)\n\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐶=w,😈=f,🐸=d,🐦=m,🐼=l,🐷=b","Alright, let's tackle this crypto word game step by step. I'll go through the information provided and try to deduce the correct emoji-letter mappings based on the history and feedback.\n\n### Given Information:\n1. **Encoded Sentence**: \n   - `😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission.`\n   \n2. **Hint**: `😍=t`\n   \n3. **History**:\n   - **Attempt 1**: \n     - Guess: `😍=t,🐶=w,😈=f,🐸=c,🐷=s,🐦=m,🐼=h`\n     - Feedback: `{'😍': True, '🐶': True, '😈': True, '🐸': False, '🐷': False, '🐦': True, '🐼': False}`\n   - **Attempt 2**: \n     - Guess: `😍=t,🐶=w,😈=f,🐸=d,🐷=n,🐦=m,🐼=o`\n     - Feedback: `{'😍': True, '🐶': True, '😈': True, '🐸': True, '🐷': False, '🐦': True, '🐼': False}`\n   - **Attempt 3**: \n     - Guess: `😍=t,🐶=w,😈=f,🐸=d,🐦=m,🐼=l,🐷=b`\n     - Feedback: `{'😍': True, '🐶': True, '😈': True, '🐸': True, '🐦': True, '🐼': False, '🐷': False}`\n\n### Known Correct Mappings:\nFrom the feedback, we know the following are correct:\n- `😍=t` (given as hint and confirmed in all attempts)\n- `🐶=w` (confirmed in all attempts)\n- `😈=f` (confirmed in all attempts)\n- `🐸=d` (confirmed in Attempts 2 and 3)\n- `🐦=m` (confirmed in all attempts)\n\n### Incorrect Mappings:\nFrom the feedback:\n- `🐼` was guessed as `h`, `o`, `l` — all were incorrect.\n- `🐷` was guessed as `s`, `n`, `b` — all were incorrect.\n\n### Analyzing the Encoded Sentence:\nLet's substitute the known correct mappings into the encoded sentence to see if we can deduce more letters.\n\nOriginal encoded sentence:\n`😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission.`\n\nSubstituting known correct emojis:\n`t a 🐼 🐼 d e f e a t e d a 🐷 s n o w (5: 20) t a 🐼 🐼 f o r c e d s n o w t o s u b m i t w i t h t h e t a 🐼 🐼 m i s s i o n.`\n\nNow, let's look at the words formed:\n1. `t a 🐼 🐼` → likely \"the\" or \"that\", but 'the' is more common. So `a 🐼 🐼` = \"he\"? Then `a` = 'h', `🐼` = 'e'?\n   - But `🐼` was guessed as 'h', 'o', 'l' before and all were wrong. 'e' hasn't been tried yet.\n   \n2. `d e f e a t e d` → this makes sense as \"defeated\".\n   \n3. `a 🐷 s n o w` → \"a 🐷 snow\" → likely \"a [letter] snow\". Maybe \"a new snow\"? So `🐷` = 'n'? But `🐷` was guessed as 'n' in Attempt 2 and was False.\n   - Alternatively, \"a few snow\"? But `😈` is 'f' already.\n   - Maybe \"a bow snow\"? Doesn't make sense.\n   - \"a low snow\"? `🐷` = 'l'? But `🐼` was guessed as 'l' in Attempt 3 and was wrong for `🐼`.\n   \nWait, let's think differently. Maybe `a 🐷 snow` is \"a [adjective] snow\". Could `🐷` be 'k'? \"a know snow\" — no. 'p'? \"a pow snow\" — pow is short for powder, but not sure.\n   \nAlternatively, maybe `a 🐷 snow` is \"a [noun] snow\". Maybe \"a man snow\"? But `🐦` is 'm'.\n   \nThis is tricky. Maybe `🐷` is 'r'? \"a row snow\" — no. 's' was tried and wrong, 'n' wrong, 'b' wrong.\n\nLet me look at other parts:\n`t a 🐼 🐼 f o r c e d s n o w t o s u b m i t w i t h t h e t a 🐼 🐼 m i s s i o n.`\n\n\"t a 🐼 🐼 forced snow to submit with the t a 🐼 🐼 mission.\"\n\n\"the [word] mission\" — could be \"the [adjective] mission\" or \"the [noun] mission\". Maybe \"the human mission\"? But `🐦` is 'm', so `🐼` can't be 'u'.\n   \n\"the ham mission\"? Doesn't make sense.\n\"the hem mission\"? No.\n\"the him mission\"? `🐼` = 'i'? Let's try `🐼` = 'i'.\n\nIf `🐼` = 'i', then `a` must be 'h' to make \"t a 🐼 🐼\" = \"t h i i\" — doesn't make sense.\n   \nAlternative: `🐼` = 'e', then `a` = 'h' → \"t h e e\" — \"thee\" is archaic for \"you\", but not common.\n   \nMaybe `🐼` = 'a', then `a` is some other letter. But `a` is likely a single-letter word, probably 'a' or 'i'. But 'a' is already a word here, so maybe `a` is 'a' in the encoding, meaning the letter 'a' is represented by 'a' itself. That's possible.\n\nIf `a` is 'a', then `t a 🐼 🐼` = \"t a 🐼 🐼\". Maybe \"t a k k\"? Doesn't make sense. Or \"t a l l\"? But `🐼` was guessed as 'l' and was wrong.\n   \nAlternatively, maybe `a` is 'i'. Then `t a 🐼 🐼` = \"t i 🐼 🐼\". Maybe \"t i m e\"? Then `🐼` = 'm', but `🐦` is 'm'.\n   \nThis is confusing. Maybe `🐼` is 'r'. Then `t a 🐼 🐼` = \"t a r r\" — \"tarr\" is not a word.\n   \nLet me think of other words in the sentence:\n\"sub m i t\" is \"submit\", which fits with `🐦` = 'm'.\n   \n\"forced snow to submit with the [word] mission\" — maybe \"the team mission\"? Then `t a 🐼 🐼` = \"t e a m\", so `a` = 'e', `🐼` = 'a', `🐼` = 'm'. But `🐦` is 'm', so `🐼` can't be 'm'.\n   \nAlternatively, \"the ham mission\" — no.\n\"the aim mission\" — `🐼` = 'a' and 'i'. Can't be both.\n   \nThis is tough. Maybe `🐼` is 'o'. Then `t a o o` — doesn't make sense. `🐼` was guessed as 'o' in Attempt 2 and was wrong.\n   \nGiven that `🐼` was guessed as 'h', 'o', 'l' and all were wrong, possible letters left are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'u', etc. 'e' is common.\n\nLet me try `🐼` = 'e':\nThen `t a e e` — maybe \"taee\"? Not a word. Unless `a` is 'h', then \"thee\".\n   \nIf `a` is 'h' and `🐼` is 'e', then `t a 🐼 🐼` = \"t h e e\" — \"thee\" is possible but old-fashioned.\n   \nThen `a 🐷 snow` = \"h 🐷 snow\". Maybe \"how snow\"? Then `🐷` = 'o'. But `🐷` was guessed as 'o' in Attempt 2 and was wrong.\n   \nAlternatively, \"hew snow\"? Not common.\n   \nThis isn't working. Maybe `🐼` is 'u':\n`t a u u` — \"tauu\"? No.\n   \nMaybe `a` is 'i', `🐼` = 'd' (but `🐸` is 'd').\n   \nThis is getting convoluted. Maybe `🐷` is 'p':\n\"a p snow\" — \"a p snow\" doesn't make sense unless it's \"a powder snow\", but 'powder' is longer.\n   \nGiven that `🐷` was guessed as 's', 'n', 'b' and all were wrong, possible letters: 'p', 'r', 'k', etc.\n   \nLet me try `🐷` = 'r':\n\"a r snow\" — \"a r snow\" doesn't make sense.\n   \n`🐷` = 'k':\n\"a k snow\" — no.\n   \n`🐷` = 'y':\n\"a y snow\" — no.\n   \nThis is stuck. Maybe `🐼` is 'n':\n`t a n n` — \"tann\"? Not a word.\n   \nGiven the time spent, let's try to make a guess based on the most plausible mappings:\n\nFrom `t a 🐼 🐼`, if `a` is 'a', then `🐼` could be 'l' (but was wrong), 'r', etc. Maybe `🐼` = 'r':\n\"t a r r\" — no.\n   \nAlternatively, maybe `a` is not 'a' in the encoding. Maybe 'a' is another letter representing 'a'. Let's assume `a` is 'a' in the encoding (i.e., the letter 'a' is represented by 'a' emoji).\n\nThen `t a 🐼 🐼` = \"t a 🐼 🐼\". Maybe \"t a l l\"? But `🐼` was guessed as 'l' and was wrong.\n   \nGiven that, let's try `🐼` = 'e' (not tried yet), `a` = 'a':\n\"t a e e\" — not a word.\n   \nAlternative approach: look at `😍o` = \"t o\" → \"to\".\n`sub🐦i😍` = \"sub m i t\" → correct.\n`😍he` = \"t h e\" → so `h` is represented by 'h' emoji? Not assigned yet.\n   \nWait, in the encoded sentence, 'h' appears in \"😍he\" = \"the\", so 'h' is represented by some emoji. But 'h' isn't assigned yet. Maybe 'h' is `a`?\n   \nIf `a` = 'h', then `t a 🐼 🐼` = \"t h 🐼 🐼\". Maybe \"t h e e\" → `🐼` = 'e'.\nThen `a 🐷 snow` = \"h 🐷 snow\". Maybe \"how snow\" → `🐷` = 'o' (but was wrong in Attempt 2).\n   \nAlternatively, \"hew snow\" → `🐷` = 'e' (but `🐼` is 'e').\n   \nThis is not working. Maybe `🐼` = 'a', `a` = 'h':\n\"t h a a\" — no.\n   \nGiven the time, let's make a guess with `🐼` = 'e' (not tried yet), `🐷` = 'p' (not tried yet), and include all correct mappings.\n\n### Final Guess:\nInclude all correct mappings from history:\n- `😍=t`\n- `🐶=w`\n- `😈=f`\n- `🐸=d`\n- `🐦=m`\n\nNew guesses:\n- `🐼=e` (not tried before)\n- `🐷=p` (not tried before)\n\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐶=w,😈=f,🐸=d,🐦=m,🐼=e,🐷=p","Based on the provided information and the history of guesses, let's analyze the current state:\n\n1.

Wait, no: \"a 🐷 snow\" → \"a snow\" implies 🐷 is empty or space, but emojis replace letters, not spaces. Maybe 🐷 = n is incorrect (from attempt 2), so 🐷 must be another letter. Alternatively, \"a snow\" is correct, so 🐷 is nothing (but unlikely). Maybe 🐷 = n is correct despite attempt 2 feedback? Wait, attempt 2: 🐷=n was marked False, so 🐷 cannot be n. Thus, \"a snow\" must be \"a snow\" without 🐷, which contradicts the encoding. Maybe 🐷 is a space? Unlikely. Alternatively, \"a 🐷 snow\" → \"a snow\" implies 🐷 is empty, which is impossible. Maybe 🐷 = n is correct, and attempt 2 feedback was wrong? Or maybe 🐷 = n is incorrect, and the word is \"a snow\" with 🐷 = nothing, which is impossible. Alternatively, maybe 🐷 = s (but attempt 1 and 6: 🐷=s were False). Maybe 🐷 = o (but \"a o snow\" is incorrect). Maybe 🐷 = w (but 🐶=w). Maybe 🐷 = m (but 🐦=m). Maybe 🐷 = d (but 🐸=d). Maybe 🐷 = a (but \"a a snow\" is incorrect). Maybe 🐷 = e (but \"a e snow\" is incorrect). Maybe 🐷 = t (but 😍=t). Maybe 🐷 = f (but 😈=f). Maybe 🐷 = h (not ruled out yet). Then \"a h snow\" is incorrect. Maybe 🐷 = g: \"a g snow\" is incorrect. Maybe 🐷 = u: \"a u snow\" is incorrect. Maybe 🐷 = y: \"a y snow\" is incorrect. Maybe 🐷 = q: \"a q snow\" is incorrect. This is confusing. Alternatively, maybe \"a 🐷 snow\" is \"an snow\" and the feedback was wrong, or 🐷 is not needed. Alternatively, maybe the word is \"snow\" without \"a\", but the encoding has \"a 🐷 snow\". Maybe 🐷 is a typo in the encoding. Alternatively, maybe 🐷 = l (not ruled out yet): \"a l snow\" is incorrect. Maybe 🐷 = j: \"a j snow\" is incorrect. Maybe 🐷 = v: \"a v snow\" is incorrect. Maybe 🐷 = x: \"a x snow\" is incorrect. Maybe 🐷 = z: \"a z snow\" is incorrect. This seems impossible unless 🐷 is a space or nothing, which contradicts the encoding. Alternatively, maybe the word is \"snow\" and \"a 🐷 snow\" is a typo, meaning 🐷 is not needed. Alternatively, maybe 🐷 = n is correct despite feedback, and the feedback was wrong. Given the confusion, perhaps 🐼 = k is correct, and 🐷 is not needed or is a typo.\n\n### Likely Correct Mappings:\n- 😍 = t\n- 🐶 = w\n- 😈 = f\n- 🐸 = d\n- 🐦 = m\n- 🐼 = k (from \"tank\")\n- 🐷 = ? (unclear, possibly incorrect feedback or typo)\n\n### Next Guess:\nGiven the confusion with 🐷, let's guess 🐼 = k and leave 🐷 for now (or guess 🐷 = n despite feedback, as it seems necessary).\n\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐶=w,😈=f,🐸=d,🐦=m,🐼=k,🐷=n","Based on the history and feedback, let's analyze the current state:\n\nCorrectly identified emojis:\n- 😍 = t\n- 🐶 = w\n- 😈 = f\n- 🐸 = d\n- 🐦 = m\n\nIncorrect guesses for 🐼 (from history): h, o, l, e, r, i, k\nIncorrect guesses for 🐷: s, n, b, p, c, s, n\n\nNow, let's look at the encoded sentence with the known letters:\n\"ta🐼🐼 defdeta de a🐷 snow (5: 20) ta🐼🐼 force snow to submis twith the ta🐼🐼mission.\"\n\nPossible words:\n1. \"ta🐼🐼\" - likely \"tall\" or \"tarr\" or similar. Since 🐼 hasn't been guessed correctly yet, let's try 'a' (not in incorrect guesses yet).\n2. \"a🐷\" - could be \"as\", \"an\", etc. But 's' and 'n' have been tried for 🐷 and were wrong. Next possible: 'a'?\n3. \"submis\" is likely \"submit\" (missing last letter), but we have 'm' for 🐦, so \"submi\" + 's'? Wait, no, 🐦 is 'm', so \"submi\" + something.\n\nFrom \"sub🐦i😍\" = \"submi\" + 't' = \"submit\" - so the last letter is already 't', which is 😍, so this fits.\n\nNow looking at \"ta🐼🐼\":\nIf we try 🐼 = 'a':\n\"taa a\" - doesn't make sense.\n🐼 = 'b' - \"tabb\" - not a word.\n🐼 = 'c' - \"tacc\" - no.\n🐼 = 'g' - \"tagg\" - no.\n🐼 = 'n' - \"tann\" - no.\n🐼 = 'p' - \"tapp\" - no.\n🐼 = 'u' - \"tauu\" - no.\n🐼 = 'v' - \"tavv\" - no.\n🐼 = 'y' - \"tayy\" - no.\n\nWait, maybe \"ta🐼🐼\" is \"that\"? Then 🐼 would be 'h', but 'h' was tried in guess 1 and was wrong.\n\nAlternative: \"take\"? Then 🐼 would be 'k', but 'k' was tried in guess 7 and was wrong.\n\n\"talk\"? 🐼 = 'l' - but 'l' was tried in guess 3 and was wrong.\n\n\"tame\"? 🐼 = 'm' - but 🐦 is 'm'.\n\n\"tank\"? 🐼 = 'n' - but 'n' not tried yet for 🐼, but 🐷 was tried as 'n' and was wrong.\n\n\"tarp\"? 🐼 = 'r' - but 'r' was tried in guess 5 and was wrong.\n\n\"task\"? 🐼 = 's' - but 's' was tried for 🐷 in guess 6 and was wrong.\n\n\"tall\"? 🐼 = 'l' - but 'l' was tried in guess 3 and was wrong.\n\nHmm, stuck on 🐼. Maybe 🐷 is 'y'? \"a🐷\" = \"ay\" - possible in \"ay snow\"?\n\nAlternatively, maybe 🐼 = 'u': \"tauu\" - no.\n🐼 = 'v': \"tavv\" - no.\n🐼 = 'y': \"tayy\" - no.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe 🐼 = 'g': \"tagg\" - no.\n🐼 = 'j': \"tajj\" - no.\n\nGiven the attempts left, let's try 🐼 = 'n' (not tried yet for 🐼) and 🐷 = 'y':\n\nGuess:\n😍=t,🐶=w,😈=f,🐸=d,🐦=m,🐼=n,🐷=y\n\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐶=w,😈=f,🐸=d,🐦=m,🐼=n,🐷=y","Based on the provided information and the history of guesses, let's analyze the current state:\n\n1. Correctly guessed emojis:\n   - 😍 = t\n   - 🐶 = w\n   - 😈 = f\n   - 🐸 = d\n   - 🐦 = m\n\n2. Incorrect guesses for 🐼 (h, o, l, e, r, i, k, n) and 🐷 (s, n, b, p, c, s, n, y)\n\n3. The encoded sentence with known letters:\n   - \"ta🐼🐼 dea fdea te d a🐷 snow (5: 20) ta🐼🐼 force d snow to subm it with the ta🐼🐼mission.\"\n\n4. Possible words:\n   - \"ta🐼🐼\" is likely \"tall\" or \"tall\" (but 'l' was incorrect for 🐼)\n   - \"a🐷\" could be \"as\" (but 's' was incorrect for 🐷)\n   - \"subm it with the ta🐼🐼mission\" suggests \"submit with the transmission\"\n\nGiven this, my new guesses would be:\n- 🐼 = a (since \"taaatmission\" doesn't make sense, maybe 'a' wasn't tried yet)\n- 🐷 = u (since \"au\" could be \"au\" in \"australia\" or similar, but not sure)\nBut looking at the word \"force d snow\" which is likely \"forded snow\", and \"ta🐼🐼\" could be \"tamed\" but 'e' is already taken by 'd'.\n\nAlternative approach: \"ta🐼🐼\" could be \"taken\" (but 'e' is 'd'), or \"taped\" (but 'e' is 'd').\n\nGiven the difficulty with 🐼, let's try:\n- 🐼 = g (not tried before)\n- 🐷 = u\n\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐶=w,😈=f,🐸=d,🐦=m,🐼=g,🐷=u","Based on the provided history and feedback, we can deduce the following correct mappings:\n- 😍 = t (from hint and confirmed in all guesses)\n- 🐶 = w (confirmed in all guesses)\n- 😈 = f (confirmed in all guesses)\n- 🐸 = d (confirmed in guesses 2-9)\n- 🐦 = m (confirmed in guesses 1-9)\n\nThe emoji 🐼 has been consistently incorrect in all guesses (🐼=h,o,l,e,r,i,k,n,g were all wrong). The emoji 🐷 has also been consistently incorrect in all guesses (🐷=s,n,b,p,c,s,n,y,u were all wrong).\n\nNow, let's look at the encoded sentence with the known mappings:\n\"ta🐼🐼 defdtae a🐷 snow (5: 20) ta🐼🐼 force snow to submith with the ta🐼🐼mission.\"\n\nFrom the context, \"ta🐼🐼\" is likely \"their\" (since \"their force snow\" makes sense in a sci-fi context, like \"their force snow to submit with their mission\"). This would make 🐼 = h (but this was wrong in guess 1). Alternatively, \"ta🐼🐼\" could be \"the\" + something, but \"the\" is already represented by 😍=t.\n\nAnother possibility is \"ta🐼🐼\" = \"that\", making 🐼 = a (but 'a' is already in the sentence as plain 'a').\n\nGiven that \"snow\" is already decoded as \"snow\" (from 🐶=w), and \"force\" is decoded as \"force\" (from 😈=f), the word \"submith\" should be \"submit\" (so 🐦=m is correct, and the last letter is 't' which is 😍).\n\nGiven that all guesses for 🐼 were wrong, and common letters not yet tried are: j, q, v, x, z. But none fit well. Maybe 🐼 = y (\"tayy\" doesn't make sense).\n\nAlternatively, maybe 🐼 = u (\"tauu\" doesn't make sense).\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe 🐼 = c (\"tacc\" doesn't make sense).\n\nGiven the attempts, perhaps the initial word is \"tall\" (but 🐼=l was wrong in guess 3).\n\nGiven the difficulty, I'll guess 🐼 = p (not tried before), and 🐷 = a (not tried before, and \"a🐷\" could be \"as\" or \"an\" - but 'a' is already in the sentence).\n\nFinal guess:\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐶=w,😈=f,🐸=d,🐦=m,🐼=p,🐷=a"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The first word is 🐹😇🐔🐔e🥺😴e🥶. The sequence \"🐔🐔e\" could be \"ee\" or \"lle\", etc., but given the hint, it's likely \"ee\". So 🐔 might be \"e\", but 🥵 is already \"e\", so 🐔 is likely another letter. Maybe \"l\" or \"t\".\n2. The word 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 could be \"the\" if 🐵=t, 🥶=h, 😇=h (but this would conflict), so maybe not. Alternatively, 🐵 could be \"i\" or \"a\".\n3. The word 👽🐹e🥶😇🐵e🧐 has \"e🥶😇\", which could be \"ing\" if 🥶=n, 😇=g. So let's try:\n   - 🥶=n\n   - 😇=g\n   Then the word becomes 👽🐹eng🐵e🧐, which could be \"something\" if 👽=s, 🐹=o, 🐵=m, 🧐=g (but 😇 is already g). Maybe not.\n4. The word 🐵👽 could be \"it\" or \"is\". Let's assume 👽=s, then 🐵=i.\n   - 👽=s\n   - 🐵=i\n5. Now, the word 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 is i🥶g🤑🥺🐔. If this is \"ignore\", then:\n   - 🥶=n\n   - 😇=g\n   - 🤑=o\n   - 🥺=r\n   - 🐔=e\n   But 🥵 is already e, so 🐔 cannot be e. Maybe \"ignore\" is not correct.\n6. Alternatively, if 🐵👽 is \"is\", then 🐵=i, 👽=s.\n   Then the word 👽🐹e🥶😇🐵e🧐 is s🐹engie🧐, which could be \"something\" if 🐹=o, 🧐=g (but 😇 is g). Maybe \"someone\" if 🧐=n (but 🥶 is n). Not sure.\n7. The word 🦆👽🥶🐼e🐔 is 🦆s🥶🐼ee. If 🥶=n, then 🦆sn🐼ee. Maybe \"sneeze\" if 🦆=z, 🐼=z, but that's unlikely. Maybe \"sneeze\" is not right.\n8. The word 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 is 🤥🥺io🤠. Maybe \"radio\" if 🤥=r, 🥺=a, 🤠=d.

From Attempt 1:\n   - Only 🥵=e was correct.\n   - 👽=s, 🐵=i, 🥶=n, 😇=g, 🐔=t were all incorrect.\n\n2. From Attempt 2:\n   - Only 🥵=e was correct (consistent with Attempt 1).\n   - 🐵=a, 🥶=n, 😇=h, 🐔=o, 👽=t were all incorrect.\n\nGiven that 🥵=e is the only confirmed correct assignment so far, and all other guesses have been incorrect, let's try to deduce other letters based on common English words and the encoded sentence structure.\n\nLooking at the encoded sentence: 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 🐵👽 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 1983.\n\nPossible observations:\n- The word \"🥵🥶\" (e?) appears twice, which could be \"en\" or \"ed\".\n- \"🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔\" could be a 6-letter word with e somewhere (from 🥵=e).\n- \"👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐\" is a longer word with e's.\n\nGiven that all previous guesses for 🐵 (i, a) were incorrect, let's try 🐵=o.\nSimilarly, 🥶=d is a common letter that could fit (e.g., \"ed\" ending).\n\nLet's try these new assignments:\n- 🥵=e (confirmed)\n- 🐵=o\n- 🥶=d\n- 😇=h (common letter, not yet disproven)\n- 🐔=t (common letter, not yet disproven)\n- 👽=a (common letter, not yet disproven)\n\nAnswer: 🥵=e,🐵=o,🥶=d,😇=h,🐔=t,👽=a","Based on the history and the hint provided, let's analyze the feedback to deduce the correct emoji-letter mappings:\n\n1. From the first guess:\n   - Only `🥵=e` was correct. All others (`👽=s`, `🐵=i`, `🥶=n`, `😇=g`, `🐔=t`) were incorrect.\n   \n2. From the second guess:\n   - Only `🥵=e` was correct. All others (`🐵=a`, `🥶=n`, `😇=h`, `🐔=o`, `👽=t`) were incorrect.\n   \n3. From the third guess:\n   - Only `🥵=e` was correct. All others (`🐵=o`, `🥶=d`, `😇=h`, `🐔=t`, `👽=a`) were incorrect.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude:\n- `🥵=e` is confirmed correct (from hint and all guesses).\n- `👽`, `🐵`, `🥶`, `😇`, and `🐔` are not `s`, `i`, `n`, `g`, `t`, `a`, `h`, `o`, `d`, or `t` (as per the incorrect guesses).\n\nNow, let's look at the encoded sentence and try to deduce possible words. The sentence is:\n`🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 🐵👽 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 1983.`\n\nGiven that `🥵=e`, let's look for common words with 'e':\n- The first word is `🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶` (length 9). Possible words: \"elephants\" (but length 9 is uncommon), \"everyone\" (but we don't have enough info).\n- The second word is `🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔` (length 6). Possible words: \"eating\", \"entire\", etc.\n- The third word is `👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐` (length 8). Possible words: \"sentence\" (but `👽` was guessed as 's' and was incorrect), \"eleventh\".\n- The fourth word is `🐵👽` (length 2). Possible words: \"at\", \"it\", \"an\", etc.\n- The fifth word is `🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔` (length 6). Possible words: \"planet\", \"target\".\n- The sixth word is `🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠` (length 5). Possible words: \"hello\", \"happy\".\n\nGiven the feedback, let's try new mappings:\n- `🐵` was guessed as 'i', 'a', 'o' and all were incorrect. Possible: 'u', 'y', etc.\n- `👽` was guessed as 's', 't', 'a' and all were incorrect. Possible: 'h', 'm', etc.\n- `🥶` was guessed as 'n', 'd' and both were incorrect. Possible: 'r', 'l', etc.\n- `😇` was guessed as 'g', 'h' and both were incorrect. Possible: 'w', 'y', etc.\n- `🐔` was guessed as 't', 'o', 't' and all were incorrect. Possible: 'm', 'b', etc.\n\nGiven the difficulty, let's try a conservative guess focusing on `🥵=e` and avoiding previously incorrect mappings:\n\nAnswer: 🥵=e","Based on the history and the hint provided, let's analyze the feedback to deduce possible correct assignments:\n\n1. From Attempt 1:\n   - Only 🥵=e was correct; all others were wrong.\n   - This means 👽≠s, 🐵≠i, 🥶≠n, 😇≠g, 🐔≠t.\n\n2.

The most frequent emoji is 🥵, which we know is 'a'. \n\n1. The first word is 🥵👽, which is 'a' + one letter. Common one-letter words after 'a' are 'I', but 'a I' doesn't make sense. Next is 'as', 'at', 'an', 'am'. 'An' seems plausible.\n   - Guess: 👽=n\n\n2. Next is 👽🦊🤑, which is 'n' + two letters. Possible words: 'not', 'now', 'new'. 'Not' seems likely.\n   - Guess: 🦊=o, 🤑=t\n\n3. 🐰🐵🤑🥵👽 is now '_ _ t a n'. Possible words: 'about', 'agent', 'often'. 'About' fits well.\n   - Guess: 🐰=b, 🐵=u\n\n4. 🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈 is 'a _ t u _ _ a _'. Possible words: 'absolute', 'actuary'. Less clear, but let's skip for now.\n\n5. 🦁🥵👻🦊 is '_ a _ o'. Possible words: 'also', 'auto'. 'Also' fits.\n   - Guess: 🦁=l, 👻=s\n\n6. 🐱😈 is '_ _'. Could be 'it', 'is', 'in'. 'Is' seems likely.\n   - Guess: 🐱=i, 😈=s\n\nNow let's update the known mappings:\n- 🥵=a\n- 👽=n\n- 🦊=o\n- 🤑=t\n- 🐰=b\n- 🐵=u\n- 🦁=l\n- 👻=s\n- 🐱=i\n- 😈=s\n\nNow let's re-examine some words with these mappings:\n- 🥵👽 = 'an' (correct)\n- 👽🦊🤑 = 'not' (correct)\n- 🐰🐵🤑🥵👽 = 'b u t a n' → 'butan' doesn't make sense. Maybe 'b u t a n' is 'button'? But we have 🤑=t, so 'button' would require 🤑=t (correct), but 'o' is already 🦊. Maybe 'b u t a n' is 'but an'? Not sure. Maybe 🐰=f, 🐵=o? But 'o' is 🦊. Maybe earlier guess is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: 🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈 is 'a _ t u _ _ a s'. Possible: 'attacks', 'attains'. 'Attacks' fits.\n   - Guess: 🧐=t, 🐶=c, 🐸=k\n\nNow known mappings:\n- 🥵=a\n- 👽=n\n- 🦊=o\n- 🤑=t\n- 🐰=b\n- 🐵=u\n- 🦁=l\n- 👻=s\n- 🐱=i\n- 😈=s\n- 🧐=t\n- 🐶=c\n- 🐸=k\n\nNow 🐰🐵🤑🥵👽 is 'b u t a n' → still unclear. Maybe 'b u t a n' is 'but an'? Maybe 🐰=f, but 'f' is not assigned yet. Maybe earlier guesses are off.\n\nGiven time constraints, let's submit current guesses:\n\nAnswer: 🥵=a,👽=n,🦊=o,🤑=t,🐰=b,🐵=u,🦁=l,👻=s,🐱=i,😈=s,🧐=t,🐶=c,🐸=k","Based on the feedback from the first guess, we know that:\n- Correct guesses: 🥵=a, 👻=s\n- Incorrect guesses: 👽, 🦊, 🤑, 🐰, 🐵, 🦁, 🐱, 😈, 🧐, 🐶, 🐸\n\nNow, let's analyze the encoded sentence with the correct information:\n🥵=a, 👻=s\n\nEncoded Sentence: 🥵👽 👽🦊🤑 🐰🐵🤑🥵👽 🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈 🦁🥵👻🦊 🐱😈 🥶🤫🥳🤓 20, 2008, 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳 🥺🤑😴🤑🥵👽🤑🥺 😈🥵👽🥵🥳🤓🥵 👽🐱 🦁🤑🐸🐱🧐🤑 👽🦊🤑 🐶😈🥵🤫🐰🤫🐵🥵🥳 🥺🐶🤧🥵👻 🐸🦊🥵🧐😇🐶🐱😈.\n\nFrom the first word \"🥵👽\" (a?):\n- Possible words: an, as, at, etc. Since 👽 was guessed as 'n' but was incorrect, let's try other common letters like 't' or 'd'.\n\nFrom \"🦁🥵👻🦊\" (a s ?):\n- Possible words: last, past, fast, etc. Since 🦁 and 🦊 were incorrect in the first guess, let's try other letters.\n\nGiven the hint 🥵=a and the correct 👻=s, let's try to guess some emojis based on common words:\n\nPossible guesses:\n- 🐱=e (common letter)\n- 🤑=h (common in \"the\")\n- 👽=t (common in \"at\", \"the\")\n- 🦊=h (common in \"the\")\n- 🐵=e (common letter)\n- 😈=d (common in \"and\")\n\nLet's try these guesses:\nAnswer: 🥵=a,👻=s,🐱=e,🤑=h,👽=t,🦊=h,🐵=e,😈=d","Based on the feedback from the previous attempts and the hint that 🥵=a, let's analyze the information:\n\n1.

From Attempt 2:\n   - Correct: 🥵=a, 👻=s, 👽=t, 🦊=h\n   - Incorrect: 🐱=e, 🤑=h, 🐵=e, 😈=d\n\nNow, let's look at the encoded sentence with the confirmed emojis:\n- 🥵=a\n- 👽=t\n- 🦊=h\n- 👻=s\n\nLooking at the first word: 🥵👽 = a t\nThis is likely \"at\" (since \"a t\" would be two separate words).\n\nSecond word: 👽🦊🤑 = t h ?\nGiven that 🤑 was guessed as 'h' in Attempt 2 but was incorrect, and common words after \"at\" could be \"the\", let's try 🤑=e.\n\nThird word: 🐰🐵🤑🥵👽 = ? ? e a t\nThis could be \"beat\" if 🐰=b and 🐵=a, but 🥵 is already 'a', so 🐵 cannot be 'a'. Maybe \"seat\" if 🐰=s, but 👻 is already 's'. Alternatively \"meat\" if 🐰=m and 🐵=e.\n\nFrom Attempt 2, 🐵=e was incorrect, so let's try 🐵=i.\n\nLet's make new guesses based on this:\n- 🤑=e (since \"the\" is likely)\n- 🐵=i\n- 🐰=m (for \"meat\")\n- 😈=d (common letter, though it was incorrect in Attempt 2, maybe it's correct now)\n- 🐱=i (common letter)\n\nNow let's check the third word with these guesses:\n🐰🐵🤑🥵👽 = m i e a t → \"miet\" doesn't make sense, so maybe 🐰=b for \"biet\" which also doesn't make sense. Maybe 🐰=s (but 👻=s), or 🐰=f for \"fiet\" which is not a word. Maybe 🐰=p for \"piet\" which is a name but unlikely.\n\nAlternative approach: look at the word 🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈 = a ? e i ? ? a ?\nIf 🤑=e and 🐵=i, this could be \"a?ei?a?\" which might be \"action\" if:\n- 🧐=c\n- 🐶=t\n- 🐸=o\n- 😈=n\n\nBut in Attempt 1, 🐶=c was incorrect, so maybe 🐶=d.\n\nLet's try:\n- 🤑=e\n- 🐵=i\n- 🧐=c\n- 🐶=d\n- 🐸=o\n- 😈=n\n\nNow the word would be \"a c e i d o a n\" which doesn't make sense. Maybe \"a c e i n a n\" if 🐸=n, but 😈=n.\n\nAlternative: \"a c t i o n\" if:\n- 🧐=c\n- 🤑=t\n- 🐵=i\n- 🐶=o\n- 🐸=n\n- 😈=something else\n\nBut 🤑 was guessed as 't' in Attempt 1 and was incorrect.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try a simpler approach with the confirmed letters and common words.\n\nGiven:\n- \"at the ?eat a?e?o?an ?a?h ?i?n ...\"\n\nPossible guesses:\n- 🤑=e (for \"the\")\n- 🐰=b (for \"beat\")\n- 🐵=a (but 🥵=a, so no)\n- 🐵=i\n- 🧐=c\n- 🐶=d\n- 🐸=o\n- 😈=n\n\nAnswer: 🥵=a,👽=t,🦊=h,👻=s,🤑=e,🐰=b,🐵=i,🧐=c,🐶=d,🐸=o,😈=n","Based on the feedback from previous attempts and the current information, let's analyze the encoded sentence and make our next guess.\n\n### Current Known Correct Mappings:\n- 🥵 = a\n- 👽 = t\n- 🦊 = h\n- 👻 = s\n- 🤑 = e\n- 😈 = n\n\n### Encoded Sentence with Known Letters:\n🥵👽 👽🦊🤑 🐰🐵🤑🥵👽 🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈 🦁🥵👻🦊 🐱😈 🥶🤫🥳🤓 20, 2008, 🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳 🥺🤑😴🤑🥵👽🤑🥺 😈🥵👽🥵🥳🤓🥵 👽🐱 🦁🤑🐸🐱🧐🤑 👽🦊🤑 🐶😈🥵🤫🐰🤫🐵🥵🥳 🥺🐶🤧🥵👻 🐸🦊🥵🧐😇🐶🐱😈.\n\nPartially decoded:\na t t h e b i e a t a c e i d o a n l a s h e n ? ? ? 20, 2008, c o o e e ? ? e ? e a t e ? n a t a ? ? a t e l e o e c e t h e d a ? b ? i a ? ? d ? a s k h a c ? d e n.\n\n### Observations:\n1.

From the encoded sentence, let's look at the word \"👽🐱\" (attempt 8). Given that 👽=t, and the word is likely \"the\" or \"to\", but \"the\" is already mapped to 🥵👽 (a t), so 👽🐱 is likely \"to\". Therefore, 🐱=o.\n\n3. Now, let's look at \"🦁🤑🐸🐱🧐🤑\". With 🤑=e, 🐸=c, 🐱=o, 🧐=m, this could be \"fecome\" which doesn't make sense, but if 🦁=f, then it's \"fecom e\" which is still not right. Maybe 🦁=b, making it \"becom e\" which is \"become\". So 🦁=b.\n\n4. Now, \"👽🦊🤑\" is \"t h e\" which is \"the\", but we already have 🥵👽 (a t) as \"at\", so this might be a different word. Maybe \"the\" is already covered, so this might be \"thy\" but that's less likely. Alternatively, it could be \"the\" as a standalone word.\n\n5. \"🐶😈🥵🤫🐰🤫🐵🥵🥳\" is \"i n a g a r a l\". This could be \"in a garage\" if 🤫=g, 🐰=a (but 🐰=g from feedback), so this doesn't fit. Maybe \"in a grand l\" if 🤫=d, but 🐰=g. This is tricky. Maybe \"in a great l\" if 🤫=t, but 👽=t. Not sure.\n\n6. \"🥺🐶🤧🥵👻\" is \"? i v a s\". If 🥺=p, then \"pivas\" which doesn't make sense. Maybe 🥺=w, making \"wivas\" which is also not a word.

This means `🤖` appears frequently in the encoded sentence, which aligns with the hint.\n- The encoded sentence contains spaces, indicating word boundaries.\n- The presence of numbers (`23` and `2007`) suggests that the sentence might include years or numerical references.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Identify Short Words**: Short words (1-3 emojis) are easier to guess. For example, the first word is `🦆👽🐧🤖🐦` (5 emojis), but the third word is `🐱🐦` (2 emojis), which could be \"it\", \"is\", \"in\", \"at\", etc.\n2. **Use the Hint**: Replace all `🤖` with `e` in the encoded sentence to see if that reveals any patterns.\n3. **Look for Repeating Patterns**: Repeated sequences of emojis might correspond to common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc.\n4. **Guess Common Words**: For example, the word `😱🤮` (2 emojis) could be \"of\", \"to\", \"in\", etc.\n\n### Applying the Hint (`🤖=e`):\nReplace all `🤖` with `e` in the encoded sentence:\n```\n🦆👽🐧e🐦 🐦🐶😍e😇🐵😱😇🤠e🐸🐦 🐱🐦 😱🤮 😱🐶🐦🐸😇😱🐧🐱😱🤮 🐦🐶😍e😇🐵😱😇🤠e🐸 🦆🐔😱🐱🤮 👽🤓🤮e🥵 🐷🐨 🤓e🐦🦉😱😇🐵e😇🐦 (🦉👽😇🐵e😇🐧🐨 🦆👽🐧e🐦 🐻😇👽🐶😍 🐷e🦉👽😇e 🐱🐸🐦 😱🦆🦁🐶🐱🐦🐱🐸🐱👽🤮 👽🤮 23 🤮👽🙄e🐵🐷e😇 2007).\n```\n\n### Guessing:\n1. The word `🐱🐦` (2 emojis) is likely a common word like \"it\" or \"is\". Let's guess `🐱=i` and `🐦=s` (so \"is\").\n   - This would make `🐱🐦` = \"is\".\n2. The word `😱🤮` (2 emojis) could be \"of\". Let's guess `😱=o` and `🤮=f` (so \"of\").\n   - This would make `😱🤮` = \"of\".\n3. Now, let's look at `🐦🐶😍e😇🐵😱😇🤠e🐸🐦`. With `🐦=s`, `😱=o`, and `🤖=e`, this becomes `s🐶😍e😇🐵o😇🤠e🐸s`. This looks like \"secrets\" or similar. Let's guess `🐶=c`, `😍=r`, `😇=t`, `🐵=a`, `🤠=d`, `🐸=s` (so \"secrets\").\n   - This would make `s🐶😍e😇🐵o😇🤠e🐸s` = \"scretaotdes\" which doesn't make sense. Maybe another approach.\n4. Alternatively, the word `👽🤓🤮e🥵` (with `🤮=f` and `e` already) is \"👽🤓fe🥵\". Could this be \"offer\" or similar? Not clear yet.\n5. The word `🐷🐨` (2 emojis) could be \"in\", \"at\", etc. Let's guess `🐷=a` and `🐨=n` (so \"an\").\n\n### Re-evaluating:\nGiven that some guesses aren't working, let's try another approach:\n- The word `🐱🐦` is likely \"in\" or \"it\". Let's try `🐱=i` and `🐦=n` (so \"in\").\n- Then `😱🤮` could be \"of\", so `😱=o` and `🤮=f`.\n- Now, `🐦🐶😍e😇🐵😱😇🤠e🐸🐦` becomes `n🐶😍et🐵ot🤠e🐸n`. This could be \"notation\" or similar. Let's guess `🐶=t`, `😍=a`, `🐵=i`, `🤠=n`, `🐸=o` (so \"notation\").\n   - Then `n🐶😍et🐵ot🤠e🐸n` = \"t a e i o t n e o n\" which doesn't fit. Maybe not \"notation\".\n\n### Final Guesses:\nGiven the complexity, let's make conservative guesses based on the hint and short words:\n1. `🤖=e` (given).\n2. `🐱=i`, `🐦=n` (for \"in\").\n3. `😱=o`, `🤮=f` (for \"of\").\n4. `🐷=a`, `🐨=n` (for \"an\").\n\n### Answer:\nGiven the current information and the hint, the most reasonable guesses are:\n- `🤖=e` (hint),\n- `🐱=i`, `🐦=n` (for \"in\"),\n- `😱=o`, `🤮=f` (for \"of\"),\n- `🐷=a`, `🐨=n` (for \"an\").\n\nAnswer: 🤖=e,🐱=i,🐦=n,😱=o,🤮=f,🐷=a,🐨=n","Based on the feedback from the first guess, we know:\n- Correct: 🤖=e, 🐱=i\n- Incorrect: 🐦, 😱, 🤮, 🐷, 🐨\n\nNow, let's analyze the encoded sentence with the known correct emojis:\nEncoded Sentence: 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦 🐱🐦 😱🤮 😱🐶🐦🐸😇😱🐧🐱😱🤮 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸 🦆🐔😱🐱🤮 👽🤓🤮🤖🥵 🐷🐨 🤓🤖🐦🦉😱😇🐵🤖😇🐦 (🦉👽😇🐵🤖😇🐧🐨 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 🐻😇👽🐶😍 🐷🤖🦉👽😇🤖 🐱🐸🐦 😱🦆🦁🐶🐱🐦🐱🐸🐱👽🤮 👽🤮 23 🤮👽🙄🤖🐵🐷🤖😇 2007).\n\nFrom the first word: 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 (5 letters, last letter is e, since 🤖=e)\nPossible words: \"there\", \"where\", \"these\", etc. But let's look for other clues.\n\nThird word: 🐱🐦 (2 letters, first is i)\nPossible: \"in\", \"it\", \"is\", etc. But 🐦 was guessed as 'n' before and was incorrect, so likely not 'n'.\n\nGiven that, let's try some common letters:\n- 't' is very common, let's guess 🐦=t\n- 'o' is common, let's guess 😱=o\n- 'a' is common, let's guess 🐷=a\n- 's' is common, let's guess 🤮=s\n- 'd' is common, let's guess 🐶=d\n- 'h' is common, let's guess 😇=h\n\nNow, let's try these guesses:\nGuess: 🤖=e, 🐱=i, 🐦=t, 😱=o, 🤮=s, 🐷=a, 🐶=d, 😇=h\n\nNow, let's see if this makes sense in the first word: 🦆👽🐧e t\nIf 🐦=t, then the word is _ _ _ e t, like \"quiet\", \"asset\", etc. Not sure yet.\n\nThird word: 🐱🐦 = i t (\"it\")\n\nFourth word: 😱🤮 = o s (\"os\" doesn't make sense, maybe 'of'?

Possible words could be \"makes\", \"takes\", \"bakes\", etc. Given that 🐵=m, 🦆 is likely not 'm' (since 🦆=m was incorrect in guess 6). \n\nFrom guess 6, we know:\n- 🦆≠m, 👽≠a, 🐧≠k, 🤮=n.\n\n### New Guesses:\n1. 🦆 = t (common letter for words like \"takes\")\n2. 👽 = h (common letter, could fit in \"the\" or similar)\n3. 🐧 = k (though guess 6 said 🐧≠k, so trying another letter like 'l')\n   - Wait, guess 6 said 🐧≠k, so trying 🐧 = l\n4. 🐶 = r (common letter, could fit in \"has\" or similar, but 'h' is not assigned yet)\n5. 😇 = h (common letter, could fit in \"has\" or similar)\n6. 😍 = o (common letter, could fit in \"has\" or similar)\n7. 🐸 = d (common letter, could fit in \"has\" or similar)\n\n### Updated Known Mappings:\n- 🤖 = e\n- 🐱 = i\n- 😱 = a\n- 🐦 = s\n- 🐵 = m\n- 🤮 = n\n- 🦆 = t\n- 👽 = h\n- 🐧 = l\n- 😇 = h\n- 🐶 = r\n- 😍 = o\n- 🐸 = d\n\n### Testing the First Word:\n🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 = t h l e s → \"thles\" doesn't make sense.

We have an emoji-encoded sentence, and we know that the most frequently occurring emoji `👽` corresponds to the letter `e`. Here's the encoded sentence again for reference:\n\n```\nn🦁🐶👽 🐶😍💩🐶 🐶🐹🦁 s🐶🦁r🦆s 🦁n r👽🤓🦁rd, 😍🤭rr🤩🤓💩n👽 💩l🤩🤓👽 🤮r🦁🦆 🐶😍👽 1954 s👽💩s🦁n 💩nd 🐶r🦁p🤩🤓💩l s🐶🦁r🦆 😂👽🐶💩 🤮r🦁🦆 🐶😍👽 2005 s👽💩s🦁n 😍💩🤥👽 🤮🦁r🦆👽d d🤭r🤩n🥵 d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r 💩nd l💩s🐶👽d 🤩n🐶🦁 🤔💩n🤭💩r🐰.\n```\n\n### Step 1: Identify the most common emoji\nWe're told that `👽` is the most frequent emoji and it stands for `e`. Let's count how many times `👽` appears to confirm its frequency.\n\nCounting `👽`:\n1. n🦁🐶`👽`\n2. r`👽`🤓🦁rd\n3. 💩n`👽`\n4. 💩l🤩🤓`👽`\n5. 🐶😍`👽`\n6. s`👽`💩s🦁n\n7. d`👽`🤓`👽`🦆b`👽`r\n8. l💩s🐶`👽`d\n9. 😂`👽`🐶💩\n10. s`👽`💩s🦁n\n11. 😍💩🤥`👽`\n12. 🤮🦁r🦆`👽`d\n\nThat's at least 12 occurrences, which seems higher than other emojis, so `👽=e` makes sense.\n\n### Step 2: Look for common words and patterns\nLet's look for short words first, as they're easier to guess.\n\n1. First word: `n🦁🐶e`\n   - Could be \"the\"? But starts with 'n', not 't'. Maybe \"one\"? But 'n' is first.\n   - Alternatively, \"new\"? But 'w' isn't assigned yet.\n   - Not sure yet.\n\n2. Second word: `🐶😍💩🐶`\n   - Four letters. Maybe \"that\"? But no 'e'.\n   - Or \"this\"? But 's' isn't assigned.\n   - Not clear.\n\n3. Third word: `🐶🐹🦁`\n   - Three letters. Maybe \"the\"? If `🐶=t`, `🐹=h`, `🦁=e`. But `👽=e`, so `🦁` can't be 'e'.\n   - Maybe \"and\"? But 'a' isn't assigned.\n   - Not sure.\n\n4. Fourth word: `s🐶🦁r🦆s`\n   - Five letters. Maybe \"stars\"? If `🐶=t`, `🦁=a`, `🦆=r`, then \"starrs\" – close to \"stars\".\n   - But `🦆` would be 'r', and `🦁=a`? Let's see.\n\nAssuming `s🐶🦁r🦆s` = \"stars\":\n- `s` = 's' (first letter)\n- `🐶` = 't'\n- `🦁` = 'a'\n- `r` = 'r' (actual letter)\n- `🦆` = 'r' (but we already have 'r', so maybe 's' is last 's' in \"stars\")\nWait, \"stars\" is 's', 't', 'a', 'r', 's'. So:\n- `s` = 's'\n- `🐶` = 't'\n- `🦁` = 'a'\n- `r` = 'r'\n- `🦆` = 's'\n\nBut `🦆` appears elsewhere, like in `s🐶🦁r🦆s` (stars), `🤮r🦁🦆` (maybe \"area\"?), but let's hold.\n\n5. Fifth word: `🦁n` = `a` + 'n' = \"an\"?\n\nIf `🦁=a`, then `🦁n` = \"an\", which makes sense.\n\nSo tentatively:\n- `🦁` = 'a'\n- `🐶` = 't'\n\nNow first word: `n🦁🐶e` = `n a t e` = \"nate\"? Not common. Maybe \"name\"? Then `🐶=m`? But earlier thought `🐶=t`. Conflict.\n\nAlternative: if `🐶=h`, `🦁=a`, then `n a h e` – not meaningful.\n\nMaybe `🐶=o`, `🦁=n`, then `n n o e` – no.\n\nHmm, maybe `🦁=i`, then `n i t e` – \"nite\"? Informal for \"night\".\n\nBut let's see other words with `🦁`.\n\n`r e 🤓 a r d` – \"reward\"? Then `🤓=w`.\n\n`💩 l 🤩 w e` – if `💩=h`, `l` is 'l', `🤩=i`, then \"h l i w e\" – not clear.\n\nAlternatively, `💩=s`, `l`='l', `🤩=a`, `w`='w', \"s l a w e\" – no.\n\nNot working. Maybe `💩=f`, \"f l a w e\" – \"flawe\"? Not a word.\n\nAlternative approach: look at `s t a r s` (assuming `🐶=t`, `🦁=a`, `🦆=s`).\n\nThen `r e w a r d` – \"reward\", so `🤓=w`.\n\nNow `💩 l 🤩 w e` – if `🤩=i`, then `💩 l i w e` – \"slice\"? But `💩=s`, `l`='l', `i`='i', `w`='c', `e`='e' – but `w` is 'w' from \"reward\", conflict.\n\nMaybe `🤩=o`, \"s l o w e\" – \"slowe\"? Not a word.\n\nAlternative: `💩=p`, \"p l o w e\" – \"plowe\"? Not standard.\n\nNot working. Maybe `💩=b`, \"b l o w e\" – \"blowe\"? Not a word.\n\nPerhaps `💩=c`, \"c l o w e\" – \"clowe\"? No.\n\nThis path isn't yielding. Maybe `🐶` isn't 't'.\n\nAlternative: look at `🐶😍e` – \"the\"? Then `🐶=t`, `😍=h`.\n\nThen `🐶😍💩🐶` = \"t h 💩 t\" – \"that\"? Then `💩=a`.\n\nBut earlier `🦁` is 'a' from \"stars\"? Conflict.\n\nWait, if `💩=a`, then `🐶😍💩🐶` = \"t h a t\" = \"that\", which makes sense.\n\nSo:\n- `🐶` = 't'\n- `😍` = 'h'\n- `💩` = 'a'\n\nNow first word: `n a t e` – \"nate\"? Maybe \"name\"? Then `🐶=m` conflicts with `🐶=t`.\n\nWait, no, `🐶=t` is set.\n\nAlternative: `n a t e` – could be \"nate\" as a name, but not common in sentences.\n\nMaybe `n` is 'i', then \"i a t e\" – \"iate\"? No.\n\nNot sure. Maybe `n` is 'o', \"o a t e\" – \"oate\"? No.\n\nPerhaps `n` is 'w', \"w a t e\" – \"wate\"? No.\n\nNot working. Maybe `🦁` isn't 'a'.\n\nAlternative: if `🐶=t`, `😍=h`, `💩=a`, then `🐶🐹🦁` = \"t 🐹 a\" – \"the\"? Then `🐹=h`, but `😍=h`, so conflict.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative: `🐶🐹🦁` = \"t 🐹 a\" – \"tea\"? Then `🐹=e`, but `👽=e`, conflict.\n\nNot working. Maybe `🐶=s`, `😍=o`, `💩=m` – but no.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe `🐶=w`, `😍=a`, `💩=s` – \"w a s w\" – no.\n\nAlternative approach: look at `s🐶🦁r🦆s` – if `🐶=t`, `🦁=h`, `r`='r', `🦆=e`, then \"s t h r e s\" – \"sthr es\"? Not a word.\n\nNot working. Maybe `🐶=f`, `🦁=i`, `🦆=r`, \"s f i r s\" – \"sfirs\"? No.\n\nThis isn't leading anywhere. Maybe start with `🐶=h`, `😍=e`, `💩=a` – \"h e a h\" – no.\n\nAlternative: look at `1954` and `2005` – likely years, so preceding words might be \"in 1954\" and \"in 2005\".\n\nBefore `1954`: `🐶😍e` – if \"in\", then `🐶=i`, `😍=n`.\n\nThen `🐶😍💩🐶` = \"i n 💩 i\" – \"init\"? Not likely. Maybe \"into\"? Then `💩=t`.\n\nSo:\n- `🐶` = 'i'\n- `😍` = 'n'\n- `💩` = 't'\n\nNow first word: `n🦁i e` – \"n 🦁 i e\" – maybe \"name\"? Then `🦁=a`, `n`='n', `i`='i', `e`='e' – \"n a i e\"? Not matching.\n\nAlternative: \"nice\"? Then `n`='n', `🦁=i`, `i`='c', `e`='e' – but `🐶=i`, so `i` is `🐶`, not `🦁`.\n\nNot working. Maybe `n` is 'o', \"o a i e\" – no.\n\nNot sure. Maybe `n` is 'm', \"m a i e\" – \"maie\"? No.\n\nThis path is stuck. Maybe `🐶=i`, `😍=n` is incorrect.\n\nAlternative: look at `s👽💩s🦁n` – \"s e t s a n\"? Not clear.\n\nGiven time, let's try assigning `🦁=o` from `🦁n` = \"on\".\n\nThen `n o 🐶 e` – \"no 🐶 e\" – \"none\"? Then `🐶=n`, but `😍=n` conflict.\n\nNot working.\n\n### Step 3: Reconstruct with partial assignments\nFrom earlier, let's try:\n- `👽` = 'e'\n- `🐶` = 't'\n- `😍` = 'h'\n- `💩` = 'a'\n\nThen:\n- `n a t e` – \"nate\" (name)\n- `t h a t` – \"that\"\n- `t 🐹 a` – maybe \"the\"? Then `🐹=h`, but `😍=h` conflict.\n  \nAlternative `t 🐹 a` – \"tea\"? `🐹=e`, but `👽=e` conflict.\n\nNot working. Maybe `t 🐹 a` – \"tia\"? Not a word.\n\nThis is challenging. Maybe `🐹=r`, \"tra\"? Not meaningful.\n\nGiven time, let's make some guesses based on frequency and common letters.\n\n### Step 4: Make educated guesses\nCommon letters in English: e, t, a, o, i, n, s, h, r, d, l, c, u, m, w, f, g, y, p, b, v, k, j, x, q, z.\n\nWe have `e`, `t`, `h`, `a` assigned.\n\nLooking at `🤓` in `r e 🤓 a r d` – likely \"reward\", so `🤓=w`.\n\nThen `💩 l 🤩 w e` = `a l 🤩 w e` – \"al w e\" – maybe \"allow\"? Then `🤩=l`, but `l` is already a letter, not assigned to emoji.\n\nWait, `l` is a letter, not an emoji here. So `a l 🤩 w e` – if `🤩=o`, \"alowe\"? Not a word. Maybe `🤩=l`, but `l` is separate.\n\nNot working. Maybe `🤩=i`, \"a l i w e\" – \"alive\"? Then `w`='v', but `🤓=w` conflicts.\n\nAlternative: `🤩=c`, \"a l c w e\" – no.\n\nNot working. Maybe `🤩=k`, \"a l k w e\" – no.\n\nThis is tough. Maybe `🤩=f`, \"a l f w e\" – no.\n\n### Step 5: Submit partial answer\nGiven the complexity, let's submit the confirmed assignments:\n\n- `👽` = 'e'\n- `🐶` = 't' (from \"that\")\n- `😍` = 'h'\n- `💩` = 'a'\n- `🤓` = 'w' (from \"reward\")\n\nAnswer: 👽=e,🐶=t,😍=h,💩=a,🤓=w","Based on the provided information, let's analyze the encoded sentence and the feedback from the first guess to make our next attempt.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Hint**: 👽=e (confirmed correct)\n2. **History Guess 1**:\n   - Correct: 👽=e, 🐶=t, 😍=h, 💩=a\n   - Incorrect: 🤓=w (so 🤓 is not 'w')\n\n3. From the encoded sentence:\n   - The word \"n🦁🐶👽\" starts with 'n' and has 't' and 'e' in it. Likely \"note\" or \"nate\". Since 'a' is 💩, \"nate\" is possible, so 🦁=a. But 💩=a, so 🦁 cannot also be 'a'. Thus, likely \"note\", so 🦁=o.\n   - \"🐶😍💩🐶\" = \"that\" (🐶=t, 😍=h, 💩=a), which fits.\n   - \"🐶🐹🦁\" = \"t_o\" (likely \"too\" or \"two\"). If 🦁=o, then 🐹=o (but 🦁=o is more likely, so maybe 🐹=w).\n   - \"s🐶🦁r🦆s\" = \"s_o_r_s\". Likely \"songs\" (if 🦆=n, r=g).\n   - \"🦁n\" = \"o_n\" (likely \"on\").\n   - \"r👽🤓🦁rd\" = \"re_word\". If 🤓 is not 'w', maybe 'd' (but 'd' is not assigned yet). Could be \"record\" (🤓=c, r=o is conflicting, so no). Maybe \"reward\" (🤓=w is incorrect, so no). Alternatively, \"reword\" (but 🤓=w is incorrect). Maybe \"reford\" (unlikely). This is tricky.\n   - \"😍🤭rr🤩🤓💩n👽\" = \"h_rr__a_e\". Could be \"harry\" or \"harry\" (if 🤭=a, but 💩=a, so no). Maybe \"harrow\" (🤭=a, but 💩=a, so no). Maybe \"harlem\" (unlikely). Not clear yet.\n   - \"💩l🤩🤓👽\" = \"a_l__e\". Could be \"apple\" (if 🤩=p, 🤓=p, but 🤓 is not 'w', could be 'p').\n   - \"🤮r🦁🦆\" = \"_ro_\". Maybe \"from\" (if 🤮=f, 🦆=m).\n   - \"🐶😍👽\" = \"the\" (confirmed).\n   - \"s👽💩s🦁n\" = \"seaso_\" (likely \"season\", so n=n).\n   - \"🐶r🦁p🤩🤓💩l\" = \"trop___l\" (could be \"tropical\", if 🤩=i, 🤓=c, but 🤓 was not 'w', could be 'c').\n   - \"d🤭r🤩n🥵\" = \"d_r__n_\". Maybe \"dragon\" (if 🤭=a, but 💩=a, so no). Maybe \"dri_n_\" (unclear).\n   - \"d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r\" = \"de_e_eb_r\" (could be \"december\", if 🤓=c, 🦆=m, b=b, r=r).\n\n### New Guesses:\nFrom the above, likely:\n- 🦁=o\n- 🦆=m\n- 🤓=c\n- 🤩=i\n- 🤮=f\n- r=r\n- 🤭=a (but 💩=a, so no). Maybe 🤭=r (but r=r). Maybe 🤭=g.\n- 🐹=w (from \"two\")\n\nBut let's try:\n- 🦁=o\n- 🦆=m\n- 🤓=c\n- 🤩=i\n- 🤮=f\n- r=r\n- 🐹=w\n\n### Answer:\nInclude the confirmed emojis and new guesses:\nAnswer: 👽=e,🐶=t,😍=h,💩=a,🦁=o,🦆=m,🤓=c,🤩=i,🤮=f,🐹=w,r=r","Based on the provided information and feedback from previous attempts, here's the analysis and the next guess:\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Correct Guesses from History**:\n   - 👽 = e\n   - 🐶 = t\n   - 😍 = h\n   - 💩 = a\n   - 🦁 = o\n   - 🦆 = m\n   - 🤓 = c\n   - 🤩 = i\n   - 🤮 = f\n   - 🐹 = w\n\n2. **Incorrect Guesses from History**:\n   - r was guessed as 'r' but was incorrect (feedback: False). So 'r' must be another letter.\n\n3. **Encoded Sentence with Known Letters**:\n   - n o t e   t h a t e   t w o   s t o r m s   o n   r e c o r d, h i r r i c a n e   a l i c e   f o m   t h e   1954 s e a s o n   a n d   t o p i c a l   s t o r m   😂 e t a   f o m   t h e   2005 s e a s o n   h a s e   f o r e d   d r i n 🥵   d e c e m b e r   a n d   l a t e d   i n t o   a n r 🐰.\n\n4. **Deciphered Words**:\n   - \"note that two storms on record, hurricane alice fom the 1954 season and topical storm 😂eta fom the 2005 season hase fored drin🥵 december and lated into anr🐰.\"\n   - Clearly, \"fom\" should be \"from\", so 'r' is likely 'f' (but 'r' was guessed as 'r' and was incorrect, so this is conflicting. Maybe 'r' is 'r' and another letter is 'f'. But '🤮' is already 'f'. So perhaps 'r' is 'f' and '🤮' is something else, but '🤮=f' was correct in previous guess.\n   - \"hase fored\" likely \"has formed\", so 'd' is 'm' (but '🦆' is already 'm'). Alternatively, 'd' could be 'd' and 'fored' is \"formed\", so 'r' is 'm', but '🦆' is already 'm'. This is confusing.\n   - \"lated into anr🐰\" likely \"lasted into anr🐰\", so 'l' is 'l', 'd' is 'd', 'n' is 'n', '🐰' is 'a' or similar.\n\n5. **New Guesses**:\n   - \"drin🥵\" is likely \"drink\" or \"drinx\", so '🥵' is 'k' or 'g'.\n   - \"anr🐰\" is likely \"anna\" or \"anra\", so '🐰' is 'a' or 'n'.\n   - \"😂eta\" is likely \"beta\", \"zeta\", or similar, so '😂' is 'b' or 'z'.\n\n### Next Guess:\nGiven the conflicts, let's try:\n- 'r' = 'f' (since \"fom\" is likely \"from\")\n- '🥵' = 'k' (for \"drin🥵\" = \"drink\")\n- '🐰' = 'a' (for \"anr🐰\" = \"anfa\" or similar, but not perfect)\n- '😂' = 'b' (for \"😂eta\" = \"beta\")\n\n### Answer:\nInclude all correct emojis from history and new guesses:\nAnswer: 👽=e,🐶=t,😍=h,💩=a,🦁=o,🦆=m,🤓=c,🤩=i,🤮=f,🐹=w,r=f,🥵=k,🐰=a,😂=b","Based on the provided information and feedback from previous attempts, here's my analysis and answer for this round:\n\n1.

New observations:\n   - The word \"s🐶🦁r🦆s\" with known letters would be \"stor_s\" (with one unknown letter). Likely \"storms\".\n   - \"d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r\" with known letters would be \"dece_b_r\". Likely \"december\".\n   - \"1954 s👽💩s🦁n\" would be \"e_aon\" → likely \"season\".\n   - \"2005 s👽💩s🦁n\" would be \"e_aon\" → likely \"season\" again.\n   - \"l💩s🐶👽d\" would be \"a_ted\" → likely \"acted\".\n\n3.

Let's consider common letters that haven't been assigned yet: 'v', 'x', 'q', 'k', 'z', etc.\n\nFrom the encoded sentence, let's look at some words:\n- \"n🦁🐶👽\" = \"n o t e\" → likely \"note\" (so 'n' = 'n' is correct, but feedback says 'n' = 'n' is incorrect. This suggests 'n' is not 'n'. Maybe 'n' = 'd'? But 'd' was guessed as 'd' and was incorrect. Alternatively, 'n' = 'k'?)\n- \"s🐶🦁r🦆s\" = \"s t o r m s\" → likely \"storms\" (so 's' = 's' is correct, but feedback says 's' = 's' is incorrect. Maybe 's' = 'c'? But '🤓' = 'c'.

Let's try to assign 'r' = 'd' and see if that helps:\n- \"r👽🤓🦁rd\" = \"d e c o dd\" → doesn't make sense. Maybe 'r' = 's' (but 's' is already taken by '🤓' = 'c' or 's' is unassigned).\n\nAlternative approach: look at \"🤮r🦁🦆\" = \"f r o m\" → should be \"from\", so 'r' = 'r' is correct, but feedback says 'r' = 'r' is incorrect. This is a contradiction, so perhaps '🤮' is not 'f'. But '🤮' = 'f' was marked correct in guess 2.\n\nGiven the confusion, let's try a conservative guess, focusing on unassigned emojis:\n- 😂 = b (was incorrect before, but maybe now with more context)\n- 🤥 = z (was incorrect before, but maybe now)\n- s = l\n- n = k\n- d = v\n- b = x\n- p = p\n- r = d\n- l = v\n\nBut this seems messy. Let's instead try to assign the remaining emojis that haven't been guessed yet: 'n', 's', 'd', 'b', 'p', 'r', 'l', '😂', '🤥'.\n\nGiven that '😂' was guessed as 'b' and was incorrect, let's try '😂' = 'v'.\nSimilarly, '🤥' = 'z' was incorrect, maybe '🤥' = 'x'.\n\n### Final Guess:\nGiven the complexity, here's a guess focusing on the remaining emojis:\n- 😂 = v\n- 🤥 = x\n- s = l\n- n = k\n- d = d\n- b = b\n- p = p\n- r = r\n- l = l\n\nBut since 'd', 'b', 'p', 'r', 'l' were incorrect when guessed as themselves, this won't work. Let's try:\n- 😂 = v\n- 🤥 = x\n- s = q\n- n = k\n- d = z\n- b = x\n- p = p\n- r = r\n- l = l\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Given the time, here's a simplified guess focusing on the most likely assignments:\n\nAnswer: 👽=e,🐶=t,😍=h,💩=a,🦁=o,🦆=m,🤓=c,🤩=i,🤮=f,🐹=w,🐰=y,🤭=u,🥵=g,🤔=j,😂=v,🤥=x,s=l,n=k,d=v,b=x,p=p,r=d,l=z","Based on the provided history and feedback, let's analyze the correct and incorrect guesses to deduce the correct mappings:\n\n### Correct Mappings (from feedback):\n- 👽 = e\n- 🐶 = t\n- 😍 = h\n- 💩 = a\n- 🦁 = o\n- 🦆 = m\n- 🤓 = c\n- 🤩 = i\n- 🤮 = f\n- 🐹 = w\n- 🐰 = y\n- 🤭 = u\n- 🥵 = g\n- 🤔 = j\n\n### Incorrect Mappings (from feedback):\n- r (attempted as r, f, d, etc., but all were incorrect)\n- s (attempted as s, l, etc., but all were incorrect)\n- n (attempted as n, k, etc., but all were incorrect)\n- d (attempted as d, v, etc., but all were incorrect)\n- b (attempted as b, x, etc., but all were incorrect)\n- p (attempted as p, but incorrect)\n- l (attempted as l, z, etc., but all were incorrect)\n- 😂 (attempted as b, v, etc., but all were incorrect)\n- 🤥 (attempted as z, x, etc., but all were incorrect)\n\n### New Deductions:\n1.

We have the following encoded sentence with a hint that `👽 = n`:\n\n```\n🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\n```\n\nFirst, let's replace all `👽` with `n` based on the hint:\n\n```\n🐵. s. in🦆🤭l🦆e🐨ent in t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖n en🐻.\n```\n\nNow, let's try to identify words or patterns that might be recognizable with some letters filled in.\n\n1. The word `in` appears twice, which makes sense as it's a common word.\n2. The word `en🐻` at the end could be \"end\" if `🐻 = d`. Let's assume that for now.\n   - So, `🐻 = d`.\n   \nNow, replace `🐻` with `d`:\n\n```\n🐵. s. in🦆🤭l🦆e🐨ent in t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖n end.\n```\n\nNow, `t🤭` could be \"to\" if `🤭 = o`. Let's try that:\n   - `🤭 = o`.\n   \nReplace `🤭` with `o`:\n\n```\n🐵. s. in🦆ol🦆e🐨ent in t🦁e w🤖🐶 co🐨es to 🤖n end.\n```\n\nNow, `co🐨es` looks like \"comes\" if `🐨 = m`.\n   - `🐨 = m`.\n   \nReplace `🐨` with `m`:\n\n```\n🐵. s. in🦆ol🦆ement in t🦁e w🤖🐶 comes to 🤖n end.\n```\n\nNow, `in🦆ol🦆ement` looks like \"involvement\" if `🦆 = v`.\n   - `🦆 = v`.\n   \nReplace `🦆` with `v`:\n\n```\n🐵. s. involvement in t🦁e w🤖🐶 comes to 🤖n end.\n```\n\nNow, `t🦁e` looks like \"the\" if `🦁 = h`.\n   - `🦁 = h`.\n   \nReplace `🦁` with `h`:\n\n```\n🐵. s. involvement in the w🤖🐶 comes to 🤖n end.\n```\n\nNow, `w🤖🐶` could be \"world\" if `🤖 = r` and `🐶 = l`.\n   - `🤖 = r`, `🐶 = l`.\n   \nReplace `🤖` with `r` and `🐶` with `l`:\n\n```\n🐵. s. involvement in the world comes to rn end.\n```\n\nHmm, \"rn end\" doesn't make sense. Maybe `🤖 = l` and `🐶 = d`, but we already have `🐻 = d`. Wait, let's see:\n\nIf `w🤖🐶` is \"world\", then:\n   - w + o + r + l + d, but we have only two emojis after 'w', so maybe \"work\" or \"word\".\n   - \"word\" would be w + o + r + d, but we have `🐻 = d`, not `🐶 = d`.\n   - \"work\" is w + o + r + k, so maybe `🤖 = o`, `🐶 = k`.\n   But `🤭 = o` already, and emojis are unique.\n   \nAlternative: \"when\" is w + h + e + n, but we have `👽 = n`.\nNot matching.\n\nWait, maybe `w🤖🐶` is \"will\" where `🤖 = i`, `🐶 = l`.\nBut then \"comes to in end\" doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternative approach: `🤖n` could be \"on\" if `🤖 = o`, but `🤭 = o` already.\nOr \"an\" if `🤖 = a`.\n\nLet's try `🤖 = a`:\n   - `🤖 = a`.\n   \nReplace `🤖` with `a`:\n\n```\n🐵. s. involvement in the wa🐶 comes to an end.\n```\n\nNow, `wa🐶` could be \"war\" if `🐶 = r`.\n   - `🐶 = r`.\n   \nReplace `🐶` with `r`:\n\n```\n🐵. s. involvement in the war comes to an end.\n```\n\nThis makes sense! Now, the first part `🐵. s.` could be initials like \"M. S.\" if `🐵 = M`.\n   - `🐵 = M`.\n   \nFinal replacements:\n- `👽 = n`\n- `🐻 = d`\n- `🤭 = o`\n- `🐨 = m`\n- `🦆 = v`\n- `🦁 = h`\n- `🤖 = a`\n- `🐶 = r`\n- `🐵 = M`\n\nNow, let's list all emojis with their corresponding letters:\n\n- `🐵 = M`\n- `👽 = n`\n- `🦆 = v`\n- `🤭 = o`\n- `🐨 = m`\n- `🦁 = h`\n- `🤖 = a`\n- `🐶 = r`\n- `🐻 = d`\n\nNow, let's format the answer as required:\n\nAnswer: 🐵=M,👽=n,🦆=v,🤭=o,🐨=m,🦁=h,🤖=a,🐶=r,🐻=d","Based on the feedback from the first attempt, we know the following correct mappings:\n- 👽 = n\n- 🦆 = v\n- 🤭 = o\n- 🨡 = m\n- 🦁 = h\n- 🤖 = a\n- 🐶 = r\n- 🐻 = d\n\nNow, let's decode the encoded sentence with the known mappings and make educated guesses for the remaining emojis.\n\nEncoded Sentence: 🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\n\nWith known mappings:\n- 🐵. s. i n v o l v e m e n t i n t h e w a r c o m e s t o a n e n d.\n\nThis looks like the phrase: \"Involvement in the war comes to an end.\"\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n- 'i n v o l v e m e n t' suggests:\n  - 'i' is likely 'I' (capitalized)\n  - 'l' is 'l' (but 'l' is not yet mapped)\n- 't h e' is 'the', so 't' is 't'\n- 'w a r' is 'war', so 'w' is 'w'\n- 'c o m e s' is 'comes', so 'c' is 'c'\n- 't o' is 'to', so 't' is 't' (already guessed)\n- 'a n' is 'an', so 'a' is 'a' (already mapped to 🤖)\n- 'e n d' is 'end', so 'e' is 'e'\n\nNow, let's map the remaining emojis:\n- '🐵' is the first word, which is likely 'I' (from 'Involvement'), but the first guess was False for '🐵=M', so '🐵' is not 'M'. Since 'I' is likely, let's try '🐵=I'.\n- 's' is the second word, which is a single letter. From the context, it might be 'a' or 'I', but 'a' is already mapped to 🤖. Maybe 's' is 'A' (but 'A' is 🤖). Alternatively, it could be 'S' for a name, but unclear. Maybe 's' is 'S'.\n- '🐨' is 'm' (already mapped).\n- '🦆' is 'v' (already mapped).\n- '🤭' is 'o' (already mapped).\n- '🦁' is 'h' (already mapped).\n- '🤖' is 'a' (already mapped).\n- '🐶' is 'r' (already mapped).\n- '🐻' is 'd' (already mapped).\n- 'e' is not yet mapped to an emoji, but appears in 'e🐨e👽t' ('ement') and 'e👽🐻' ('end'). The emoji for 'e' is not yet assigned, but looking at the sentence, 'e' appears as 'e' in the encoded text (not replaced by an emoji). Wait, the encoded sentence has 'e' as itself, so maybe 'e' is not replaced. But 'e' appears in 'e🐨e👽t' and 'e👽🐻', so perhaps 'e' is not replaced. Alternatively, maybe 'e' is replaced by an emoji not yet mapped. Looking back, 'e' appears as itself in the encoded sentence, so perhaps 'e' is not replaced.\n\nFrom the encoded sentence, the emojis not yet mapped are:\n- '🐵' (first word, likely 'I')\n- 's' (second word, likely 'S')\n- 'l' (in 'i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t' = 'involvement'), so 'l' is 'l', but the emoji for 'l' is not yet mapped. The emoji '🤭' is 'o', '🦆' is 'v', so 'l' must be the emoji before '🦆' in '🤭l🦆'. Wait, the word is 'i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t' = 'i n v o l v e m e n t', so '🤭l🦆' is 'olv', so 'l' is represented by an emoji. The emojis here are '🤭' (o), then 'l' is next, but the next symbol is 'l' (not an emoji). Wait, the encoded sentence has '🤭l🦆', where '🤭' is 'o', 'l' is 'l', and '🦆' is 'v'. So 'l' is not replaced by an emoji; it's just 'l'. So no emoji maps to 'l'.\n\nSimilarly, 't' is not replaced by an emoji in 't h e' ('t' is 't'), 't o' ('t' is 't'), etc. So 't' is not replaced.\n\nThus, the only remaining emoji to map is '🐵', which is likely 'I'.\n\nNow, let's submit the guess for this round, including all correct mappings and the new guess for '🐵':\n\nAnswer: 👽=n,🦆=v,🤭=o,🐨=m,🦁=h,🤖=a,🐶=r,🐻=d,🐵=I,s=S","Based on the history and feedback, let's analyze the information:\n\n1.

From Attempt 2, we know that:\n   - Correct guesses: same as above\n   - Incorrect guesses: 🐵=I, s=S\n\nNow let's look at the encoded sentence with known emojis:\n\"🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\"\n\nSubstituting known values:\n\"🐵. s. involvement in the war comes to an end.\"\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n- The first word is likely \"My\" or \"In\" (but \"I\" was wrong in Attempt 2)\n- \"s\" is not \"S\", could be \"a\" (but \"a\" is already taken by 🤖), maybe \"t\"?\n- The sentence seems to be \"My. a. involvement in the war comes to an end.\"\n\nBut \"a involvement\" doesn't sound right, probably \"an involvement\", so \"s\" might be \"n\" but 👽 is already \"n\".\n\nAlternative approach:\nLooking at \"i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t\" = \"involvement\":\n- i = i\n- 👽 = n\n- 🦆 = v\n- 🤭 = o\n- l = l\n- 🦆 = v\n- e = e\n- 🐨 = m\n- e = e\n- 👽 = n\n- t = t\n\nSo we can see that \"e\" appears as itself, and \"l\" and \"t\" are not yet assigned.\n\nFrom \"t🦁e\" = \"the\":\n- t = t\n- 🦁 = h\n- e = e\n\nFrom \"w🤖🐶\" = \"war\":\n- w = w\n- 🤖 = a\n- 🐶 = r\n\nFrom \"c🤭🐨es\" = \"comes\":\n- c = c\n- 🤭 = o\n- 🐨 = m\n- e = e\n- s = s\n\nWait, but in Attempt 2, \"s=S\" was incorrect, but here it seems \"s\" must be \"s\" to make \"comes\" correct. Maybe the feedback was that \"s\" was not \"S\" (uppercase), but could be \"s\" lowercase.\n\nSimilarly, first word \"🐵.\" could be \"I.\" but \"I\" was marked wrong, maybe \"A.\"?\n\nBut \"A. a. involvement\" doesn't make sense. Maybe \"My. a. involvement\" - but \"My\" would require:\n- 🐵 = M\n- y is not assigned yet\n\nBut \"🐵=M\" was wrong in Attempt 1. Maybe \"🐵=W\"?\n\nNot sure.

This suggests s might represent a different letter or is case-sensitive (but since s=s was False, it's likely not lowercase s).\n\n### Decoding the Sentence:\nEncoded Sentence: 🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\n\nSubstitute known emojis:\n- 🐵. s. i n v o l v e m e n t i n t h e w a r c o m e s t o a n e n d.\n\nThis looks like: \"?. ?. involvement in the war comes to an end.\"\n\nFrom context:\n1. The first word is likely \"My\" or \"In\", but \"My\" was tried (M and I for 🐵 were wrong). \"In\" would require 🐵 = I, but that was wrong. Maybe \"It\"?\n   - If 🐵 = I, but Attempt 2 said 🐵=I was False. So not \"I\".\n   - Maybe \"He\" or \"We\"? But 🐵 is one emoji, so single letter.\n   - Could be \"A. ?. involvement...\", so 🐵 = A, but 🤖 = a (lowercase a). So 🐵 is uppercase A? But 🤖 is lowercase a.\n\n2. The second word is \"s.\", likely \"s.\" as in \"Mr.\", \"Dr.\", etc. But s was guessed as S and s, both wrong. Maybe \"s\" is another letter like \"x\" or \"y\"?\n\nGiven the confusion, let's focus on the remaining emojis:\n- 🐵: Not M, I. Maybe H? But 🦁=h. Maybe T?\n- s: Not S, s. Maybe another letter like 'x' or 'y'?\n\nBut the sentence seems to be: \"?. ?. involvement in the war comes to an end.\" The first two words are likely \"My s.\" or similar, but \"My\" was tried and failed. Maybe \"A x.\"?\n\nGiven the attempts, let's guess:\n- 🐵 = A (uppercase A, since 🤖=a is lowercase)\n- s = x (as a placeholder)\n\n### Final Guess:\nInclude all confirmed emojis and new guesses:\n- 👽 = n\n- 🦆 = v\n- 🤭 = o\n- 🐨 = m\n- 🦁 = h\n- 🤖 = a\n- 🐶 = r\n- 🐻 = d\n- 🐵 = A\n- s = x\n\nAnswer: 👽=n,🦆=v,🤭=o,🐨=m,🦁=h,🤖=a,🐶=r,🐻=d,🐵=A,s=x","Based on the provided information and feedback from previous attempts, here's the analysis:\n\n1.

Maybe 🐵 = T?\n\nLooking at the rest:\n\"comes to an end\" is correct with current mappings:\nc🤭🐨es = c o m e s\nt🤭 = t o\n🤖👽 = a n\ne👽🐻 = e n d\n\nSo the only remaining letters to guess are 🐵 and s.\n\nGiven that 's' is a single letter word and 'a' is taken, possible options: I, A (both guessed False), maybe 'O' but 'o' is 🤭. Next would be 'T' or 'M' ('m' is 🐨).\n\nGiven that 🐵 was guessed as M, I, A (all False), and 's' was guessed as S, s, x (all False), perhaps:\n- 🐵 = T\n- s = ?\n\nBut 'T' would make the first words \"T. s.\" which doesn't make sense.

The remaining unknown emojis are:\n   - 🐵 (first word, likely a single-letter word, possibly \"I\" or \"A\")\n   - s (second word, likely a single-letter word, possibly \"s\" or \"a\")\n   - i (appears before \"nvolvement\", likely part of \"involvement\")\n\n5.

The first word is 🐵. s., which likely stands for initials or abbreviations. Given that 's' has been guessed as 's' but marked as false, it's likely not 's'. From the history, 's' has been guessed as 's', 'x', 'a', 'k', etc., all marked as false. The correct letter for 's' is still unknown.\n2. The word \"involvement\" is partially decoded as \"i n v o l v e m e n t\", which fits perfectly with the known mappings.\n3. The word \"the\" is decoded as \"t h e\", which fits with 🦁 = h.\n4. The word \"war\" is decoded as \"w a r\", which fits with 🤖 = a and 🐶 = r.\n5. The word \"comes\" is decoded as \"c o m e s\", which fits with 🤭 = o and 🐨 = m.\n6. The word \"to\" is decoded as \"t o\", which fits with 🤭 = o.\n7. The word \"an\" is decoded as \"a n\", which fits with 🤖 = a and 👽 = n.\n8. The word \"end\" is decoded as \"e n d\", which fits with 👽 = n and 🐻 = d.\n\n### Deductions:\n- The first word 🐵. s. is likely \"I. s.\" or similar, but 's' is not 's'. Given that 's' is a single letter, it could be 'I. R.', 'I. M.', etc., but none of these fit well. Alternatively, 🐵 could be 'I' and 's' could be another letter like 'f' or 'g', but this is unclear.\n- The letter 'e' is not yet mapped. From the decoded words, 'e' appears in \"involvement\", \"the\", \"comes\", \"to\", \"an\", \"end\". The emoji for 'e' is not yet identified. Looking at the encoded sentence, the emoji for 'e' must be one of the unmapped emojis: 🐵, s, i, l, e, t, w, c, e. From \"involvement\", the 'e's are represented by 🐨 (m) and 👽 (n), which doesn't make sense, so likely 'e' is another emoji. The emoji 'e' appears in \"e🐨e👽t\" (e m e n t) and \"e👽🐻\" (e n d), so 'e' is likely the emoji before 🐨 and 👽 in these words. In \"e🐨e👽t\", the first 'e' is the emoji before 🐨, which is 'l' (🦆 is 'v', 🤭 is 'o', so 'l' is the next letter). But 'l' is 'l' in \"involvement\", so the emoji for 'l' is not yet mapped. Wait, in \"i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t\", the 'l' is 🤭, but 🤭 is 'o', so this is confusing. Perhaps the emoji for 'e' is the one before 🐨 in \"l🦆e🐨\", which is 🦆 = 'v', but 'v' is already mapped to 🦆. This suggests that the emoji for 'e' is not yet clearly identified.\n- Alternatively, the emoji for 'e' could be the one before 👽 in \"e👽🐻\" (e n d). The emoji before 👽 is 'e', so the emoji for 'e' is the one before 👽, which is 'e' itself, but this is circular. This suggests that the emoji for 'e' is not yet mapped and is one of the remaining emojis: 🐵, s, i, l, e, t, w, c, e.\n\nGiven the confusion, let's focus on the first word 🐵. s.:\n- From the history, 🐵 has been guessed as 'M', 'I', 'A', 'i', 'y', all marked as false. Possible letters for 🐵 could be 'D', 'F', 'G', etc., but none seem obvious.\n- 's' has been guessed as 's', 'x', 'a', 'k', all marked as false. Possible letters could be 'f', 'g', 'j', etc.\n\nGiven that we have only two attempts left, let's try to guess the remaining letters based on common words:\n- The first word could be \"I. R.\" (🐵 = I, s = R), but 's' was not 's' or 'a'.\n- Alternatively, \"D. C.\" (🐵 = D, s = C), but 's' was not 'c'.\n\nGiven the time constraints, here is a reasonable guess based on the decoded sentence:\n\n### Final Answer:\nInclude all confirmed mappings and guess the remaining ones:\n- 👽 = n\n- 🦆 = v\n- 🤭 = o\n- 🐨 = m\n- 🦁 = h\n- 🤖 = a\n- 🐶 = r\n- 🐻 = d\n- 🐵 = I (though marked false before, perhaps case matters)\n- s = f (new guess)\n\nAnswer: 👽=n,🦆=v,🤭=o,🐨=m,🦁=h,🤖=a,🐶=r,🐻=d,🐵=I,s=f","Based on the provided information and the history of guesses, let's analyze the encoded sentence and the feedback to make an educated guess for the remaining emojis.\n\n### Encoded Sentence:\n🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\n\n### Known Emoji-Letter Mappings:\n- 👽 = n (from hint)\n- 🦆 = v (from history, feedback True)\n- 🤭 = o (from history, feedback True)\n- 🨁 = m (from history, feedback True)\n- 🦁 = h (from history, feedback True)\n- 🤖 = a (from history, feedback True)\n- 🐶 = r (from history, feedback True)\n- 🐻 = d (from history, feedback True)\n\n### Decoded Sentence with Known Mappings:\n🐵. s. i n v o l v e m e n t i n t h e w a r c o m e s t o a n e n d.\n\n### Possible Words:\n- \"involvement in the war comes to an end\"\n\n### Remaining Emojis to Guess:\n- 🐵 (first word, likely \"I\" or \"A\", but previous guesses for \"I\" and \"A\" were False)\n- s (second word, single letter, likely \"s\" or \"a\", but previous guesses for \"s\" were False)\n\n### Possible Guesses for 🐵:\nPrevious guesses for 🐵: M, I, A, y, i, I, I, I (all False)\nPossible remaining letters: Maybe \"Y\" (but \"y\" was guessed and False), \"O\" (but \"o\" is already 🤭), \"U\", \"W\", etc.\n\nGiven that \"involvement\" starts with \"i\", and \"i\" is already in the sentence, 🐵 is likely the start of the first word.

Maybe \"halof\" is \"halon\" or similar, but this is unclear).\n3. \"co🥶t😎🥶ued\" with 🥶 = n would be \"cont😎nued\" (so 😎 = i).\n4. \"🥶orthward\" with 🥶 = n would be \"northward\".\n5. \"affect😎🥶g\" with 😎 = i and 🥶 = n would be \"affecting\".\n6. \"ce🥶tral\" with 🥶 = n would be \"central\".\n7. \"u🥶😎ted\" with 🥶 = n and 😎 = i would be \"united\".\n8. \"sol🥶g\" with 🥶 = n would be \"solng\" (doesn't make sense, maybe \"soling\" or \"solving\" - but we don't have v yet).\n9. \"😎ts\" with 😎 = i would be \"its\".\n10. \"eath\" is likely \"earth\" (so 😍 = r, but 😍 was previously guessed as e and was incorrect. Maybe another emoji represents e).\n11. \"a🥶d\" with 🥶 = n would be \"and\".\n12. \"was\" is already correct.\n13. \"🤑ast\" with 🤑 = l would be \"last\".\n14. \"d😎s😎🥶gu😎shac🥶e\" with 😎 = i and 🥶 = n would be \"disinguishacne\" - likely \"distinguishing\" (so 🤗 = t).\n15. \"eastern\" is already correct.\n16. \"great\" is already correct.\n17. \"🤑akes\" with 🤑 = l would be \"lakes\".\n18. \"reg😎o🥶\" with 😎 = i and 🥶 = n would be \"region\".\n19. \"august\" is already correct.\n\nNow, let's verify the new guesses:\n- 🥶 = n\n- 😎 = i\n- 🤗 = t\n\nNow, let's check the feedback from the first guess to ensure these don't conflict:\n- 🥶 was guessed as i (incorrect), now guessed as n (ok).\n- 😎 was guessed as f (incorrect), now guessed as i (ok).\n- 🤗 was guessed as c (incorrect), now guessed as t (ok).\n\nNow, let's look at \"eath\". If it's \"earth\", then the emoji before \"ath\" is 😍. So 😍 = e (but in the first guess, 😍=e was incorrect). So this suggests 😍 is not e. Maybe \"eath\" is \"earth\" and the emoji is something else, or maybe \"eath\" is \"east\" (but we already have \"eastern\"). Alternatively, maybe \"eath\" is \"each\" (but we don't have c yet). This is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"sol🥶g\" is \"solving\" (so v is represented by some emoji). The emoji before \"ing\" is 🥶, which we've guessed as n, so this doesn't fit. Maybe \"soling\" is correct, but it's not a common word.\n\nGiven this, our best guesses are:\n- 🥶 = n\n- 😎 = i\n- 🤗 = t\n\nNow, let's include all correct pairs from the first guess and these new guesses:\n- 🤓 = a\n- 🤑 = l\n- 🐷 = d\n- 🙄 = s\n- 💩 = o\n- 🥶 = n\n- 😎 = i\n- 🤗 = t\n\nNow, let's check if any other emojis can be guessed:\n- \"e🤓ster🥶\" is \"eastern\" (so e is not represented by an emoji here, it's plain e).\n- \"gre🤓t\" is \"great\" (e is plain).\n- \"augu🙄t\" is \"august\" (u is plain).\n- \"31\" is plain.\n\nNow, let's look at \"😍🤓th\". With 🤓 = a, this is \"😍ath\". If not \"earth\", maybe \"death\" (but d is 🐷). Maybe \"health\" (but h is not assigned yet). Maybe \"neath\" (but not common). This is unclear.\n\nNow, let's look at \"🤑🤓ke🙄\" with 🤑 = l, 🤓 = a, 🙄 = s: \"lakes\". So this fits.\n\nNow, let's look at \"reg😎💩🥶\" with 😎 = i, 💩 = o, 🥶 = n: \"region\". Fits.\n\nNow, let's look at \"u🥶😎te🐷\" with 🥶 = n, 😎 = i, 🐷 = d: \"united\". Fits.\n\nNow, let's look at \"ce🥶tr🤓🤑\" with 🥶 = n, 🤓 = a, 🤑 = l: \"central\". Fits.\n\nNow, let's look at \"affect😎🥶g\" with 😎 = i, 🥶 = n: \"affecting\". Fits.\n\nNow, let's look at \"co🥶t😎🥶ued\" with 🥶 = n, 😎 = i: \"continued\". Fits (but we don't have u yet). The emoji before \"ued\" is 🥶 = n, so \"nued\" is part of \"continued\", meaning u is plain.\n\nNow, let's look at \"halof\". With h plain, a = 🤓, l = 🤑, o = 💩, f plain: \"halof\" is likely \"halof\" (but not a word). Maybe \"halon\" (but o is 💩, and n is 🥶, so \"halo🥶\" - but this would require the last letter to be 🥶 = n, but it's f plain. Maybe \"halof\" is a typo or incorrect guess.\n\nGiven this, our best current guesses are:\n- 🤓 = a\n- 🤑 = l\n- 🐷 = d\n- 🙄 = s\n- 💩 = o\n- 🥶 = n\n- 😎 = i\n- 🤗 = t\n\nNow, let's submit these as the answer for this round.\n\nAnswer: 🤓=a,🤑=l,🐷=d,🙄=s,💩=o,🥶=n,😎=i,🤗=t","Based on the provided information and feedback from previous attempts, here's the current state of the emoji-letter mappings:\n\nCorrect mappings from History:\n- 🤓 = a\n- 🤑 = l\n- 🐷 = d\n- 🙄 = s\n- 💩 = o\n- 🥶 = n\n- 😎 = i\n\nIncorrect or unconfirmed mappings from History:\n- 😍 (was e in Attempt 1, but feedback was False)\n- 🤗 (was c in Attempt 1 and t in Attempt 2, but feedback was False both times)\n\nNow, let's analyze the encoded sentence with these known mappings:\n\n\"💩🥶e h🤓🤑f c💩🥶t😎🥶ue🐷 t💩 r🤓ce 🥶💩rthw🤓r🐷, 🤓ffect😎🥶g the ce🥶tr🤓🤑 u🥶😎te🐷 🙄t🤓te🙄 🤓🤑💩🥶g 😎t🙄 😍🤓th, 🤓🥶🐷 w🤓🙄 🤑🤓🙄t 🐷😎🙄t😎🥶gu😎🙄h🤓🤗🤑e 😎🥶 the e🤓🙄ter🥶 gre🤓t 🤑🤓ke🙄 reg😎💩🥶 💩🥶 🤓ugu🙄t 31.\"\n\nSubstituting known letters:\n\"one h a l f c o n t i n u e d t o r a c e n o r t h w a r d, a f f e c t i n g the ce n t r a l u n i t e d s t a t e s a l o n g i t s e a t h, a n d w a s l a s t d i s t i n g u i s h a c l e i n the e a s t e r n gre a t l a k e s reg i o n o n a u g u s t 31.\"\n\nFrom this, we can make educated guesses for the remaining emojis:\n- \"e a t h\" is likely \"earth\" → 😍 = r\n- \"d i s t i n g u i s h a c l e\" is likely \"distinguishable\" → 🤗 = b (since 'c' and 't' were wrong before)\n- \"gre a t\" is likely \"great\" → 🤑 is already l, so this confirms it\n- \"reg i o n\" is correct with i\n- \"a u g u s t\" is correct with s\n\nNow, let's look at the first word: \"one h a l f c o n t i n u e d\" - this should be \"one half continued\" → e = h (but 'e' is already in position), wait no, looking at the emojis: 💩🥶e = one → we have o,n,e, so e must be 'e' (but it's already in position).

New information from the encoded sentence:\n   - The letter 'e' appears in the encoded sentence as itself (not replaced by emoji)\n   - We have new emojis to decode: h, f, c, t, u, r, w, g, m, k, etc.\n\n3. From the encoded sentence \"💩🥶e h🤓🤑f c💩🥶t😎🥶ue🐷 t💩 r🤓ce\", substituting known emojis:\n   - \"one ha_lf con_inued to race\" → likely \"one half continued to race\"\n   - This suggests:\n     - h=h (already appears as itself)\n     - f=f (already appears as itself)\n     - c=c (already appears as itself)\n     - t=t (already appears as itself)\n     - u=u (already appears as itself)\n     - r=r (already appears as itself)\n\n4. From \"northw🤓r🐷\" → \"northward\" (we already have a,d)\n   - w=w (already appears as itself)\n\n5. From \"affect😎🥶g\" → \"affecting\" (we have a,i,n)\n   - g=g (already appears as itself)\n\n6. From \"center🤓🤑\" → \"central\" (we have a,l)\n\n7. From \"un😎te🐷\" → \"united\" (we have i,d)\n   - e appears as itself, so no new info\n\n8. From \"state🙄\" → \"states\" (we have s)\n\n9. From \"along😎n\" → \"alongin\" (doesn't make sense, probably wrong)\n   - Maybe \"along in\" (but space is present)\n   - Or \"alignment\" (but length doesn't match)\n\n10. From \"with🤗🤑e\" → \"with b_e\" → likely \"with babe\" or \"with base\"\n    - Given previous feedback that e is not replaced by emoji, probably \"with base\"\n\n11. From \"entern gre🤓t\" → \"entern great\" → likely \"eastern great\"\n    - e appears as itself\n    - r=r\n    - grea_ → great (t is already known)\n    - So no new info\n\n12. From \"s🤓ke🙄\" → \"sakes\" or \"sakes\" (not clear)\n    - Maybe \"lakes\" (but we have l as 🤑)\n    - Or \"bakes\" (but b is 🤗)\n\n13. From \"reg😎💩n\" → \"region\" (we have i,o,n)\n    - e appears as itself\n\n14. From \"augu🙄t\" → \"august\" (we have a,u,g,s,t)\n\n15. The number 31 at the end might suggest a date, possibly \"August 31\"\n\nPutting it all together, the emojis we can confidently assign are:\n- 🤓=a, 🤑=l, 🐷=d, 🙄=s, 💩=o, 🥶=n, 😎=i, 🤗=b\n\nFor new emojis that appear in the text but haven't been assigned yet (like 😍, e, etc.), we don't have enough information to assign them confidently in this round.\n\nAnswer: 🤓=a,🤑=l,🐷=d,🙄=s,💩=o,🥶=n,😎=i,🤗=b","Based on the provided information and feedback from previous attempts, here's the current mapping of emojis to letters:\n\n- 🤓 = a\n- 🤑 = l\n- 🐷 = d\n- 🙄 = s\n- 💩 = o\n- 🥶 = n\n- 😎 = i\n- 🤗 = b\n\nNow, let's analyze the encoded sentence with these mappings:\n\nEncoded Sentence: 💩🥶e h🤓🤑f c💩🥶t😎🥶ue🐷 t💩 r🤓ce 🥶💩rthw🤓r🐷, 🤓ffect😎🥶g the ce🥶tr🤓🤑 u🥶😎te🐷 🙄t🤓te🙄 🤓🤑💩🥶g 😎t🙄 😍🤓th, 🤓🥶🐷 w🤓🙄 🤑🤓🙄t 🐷😎🙄t😎🥶gu😎🙄h🤓🤗🤑e 😎🥶 the e🤓🙄ter🥶 gre🤓t 🤑🤓ke🙄 reg😎💩🥶 💩🥶 🤓ugu🙄t 31.\n\nSubstituting known emojis:\no n e h a l f c o n t i n u e d t o r a c e n o r t h w a r d, a f f e c t i n g the ce n t r a l u n i t e d s t a t e s a l o n g i t s e a t h, a n d w a s l a s t d i s t i n g u i s h a b l e i n the e a s t e r n gre a t l a k e s reg i o n o n a u g u s t 31.\n\nFrom this, we can deduce the following words:\n- \"one half continued to race northward, affecting the central united states along its eath, and was last distinguishable in the eastern great lakes region on august 31.\"\n\nThe word \"eath\" seems incorrect; it should likely be \"east\". This suggests that 😍 = s (but 🙄 is already s). Alternatively, 😍 might be another letter like 'm' or 'c', but given the context, it's likely 'e' was intended. However, 'e' was previously guessed as False, so let's consider other options.\n\nLooking at \"gre a t l a k e s\", the word is \"great lakes\", so the missing letters are 'r' and 'e'. We already have 'r' from \"race\" (r🤓ce → r a c e), so 'e' must be another emoji. From \"eath\", it seems 'e' is missing, but 'e' was guessed as False before. Maybe 'e' is not directly mapped yet.\n\nFrom \"one half\", 'e' is the second letter, so 'e' is likely the emoji 'e' itself (as it appears in the encoded sentence as 'e').\n\nNow, let's guess the remaining emojis:\n- 'e' is already in the encoded sentence as 'e'.\n- 'c' is in \"race\" (r a c e), so 'c' is likely the emoji 'f' (but 'f' is not yet mapped). Wait, in \"half\" (h a l f), 'f' is the last letter, so 'f' is the emoji 'f' in the encoded sentence.\n- 'u' is in \"united\" (u n i t e d), so 'u' is the emoji 'u'.\n- 'g' is in \"great\" (g r e a t), so 'g' is the emoji 'g'.\n- 'k' is in \"lakes\" (l a k e s), so 'k' is the emoji 'k'.\n- 'w' is in \"was\" (w a s), so 'w' is the emoji 'w'.\n- 'h' is in \"half\" (h a l f), so 'h' is the emoji 'h'.\n- 't' is in \"the\" (t h e), so 't' is the emoji 't'.\n- 'r' is in \"race\" (r a c e), so 'r' is the emoji 'r'.\n- 'm' is not yet seen, but \"august\" is 'a u g u s t', so 'm' is not needed here.\n\nFrom the encoded sentence, the emoji '😍' appears in \"😍🤓th\", which we guessed as \"eath\" but should be \"east\", so '😍' is likely 'e'. However, 'e' was guessed as False before, so perhaps '😍' is another letter like 'm'. But \"east\" is more likely, so maybe the previous 'e' guess was incorrect because it was not the right emoji.\n\nGiven the confusion, let's stick to the confirmed mappings and guess the remaining emojis based on the current sentence.\n\nCurrent confirmed mappings:\n- 🤓 = a\n- 🤑 = l\n- 🐷 = d\n- 🙄 = s\n- 💩 = o\n- 🥶 = n\n- 😎 = i\n- 🤗 = b\n\nNow, let's guess the remaining emojis in the sentence:\n- 'e' is 'e' (from \"one\").\n- 'h' is 'h' (from \"half\").\n- 'f' is 'f' (from \"half\").\n- 'c' is 'c' (from \"continued\").\n- 'u' is 'u' (from \"united\").\n- 't' is 't' (from \"the\").\n- 'r' is 'r' (from \"race\").\n- 'w' is 'w' (from \"was\").\n- 'g' is 'g' (from \"great\").\n- 'k' is 'k' (from \"lakes\").\n- 'm' is not present, so no need to guess.\n\nNow, the emoji '😍' appears in \"😍🤓th\" which should be \"east\", so '😍' = 'e'. Even though 'e' was guessed as False before, it might have been a different emoji. Given the context, '😍' is likely 'e'.\n\nThus, the new guess is:\nAnswer: 🤓=a,🤑=l,🐷=d,🙄=s,💩=o,🥶=n,😎=i,🤗=b,😍=e,e=e,h=h,f=f,c=c,u=u,t=t,r=r,w=w,g=g,k=k","Based on the provided information and feedback from previous guesses, here's my analysis and answer for this round:\n\n1. From the history, we know these emoji-letter pairs are correct:\n   - 🤓=a, 🤑=l, 🐷=d, 🙄=s, 💩=o, 🥶=n, 😎=i, 🤗=b\n\n2. Looking at the encoded sentence and known letters:\n   - \"💩🥶e\" = \"o n e\" → likely \"one\" → e = e\n   - \"h🤓🤑f\" = \"h a l f\" → likely \"half\" → f = f\n   - \"c💩🥶t😎🥶ue\" = \"c o n t i n u e\" → likely \"continue\" → u = u, e = e\n   - \"r🤓ce\" = \"r a c e\" → likely \"race\" → c = c, e = e\n   - \"🥶💩rthw🤓r🐷\" = \"n o rthw a r d\" → likely \"northward\" → r = r, t = t, h = h, w = w\n   - \"e🤓🙄ter🥶\" = \"e a s t e r n\" → likely \"eastern\" → e = e, t = t, r = r\n   - \"gre🤓t\" = \"gr e a t\" → likely \"great\" → g = g, e = e, t = t\n   - \"🤑🤓ke🙄\" = \"l a k e s\" → likely \"lakes\" → k = k\n\n3. From previous feedback, we know 😍=e was incorrect, and from context it's likely 😍=m (as in \"earth\" would be \"northward, affecting the central united states and m_ _ _\")\n\nPutting it all together, here's my answer for this round:\n\nAnswer: 🤓=a,🤑=l,🐷=d,🙄=s,💩=o,🥶=n,😎=i,🤗=b,e=e,f=f,c=c,u=u,t=t,r=r,h=h,w=w,g=g,k=k,😍=m","Based on the provided history and feedback, let's analyze the correct and incorrect guesses to deduce the correct mappings:\n\n### Correct Mappings (from History):\n- 🤓 = a\n- 🤑 = l\n- 🐷 = d\n- 🙄 = s\n- 💩 = o\n- 🥶 = n\n- 😎 = i\n- 🤗 = b\n\n### Incorrect Mappings (from History):\n- 😍 has been guessed as e, r, m (all incorrect)\n- e has been guessed as e (incorrect)\n- f has been guessed as f (incorrect)\n- c has been guessed as c (incorrect)\n- u has been guessed as u (incorrect)\n- t has been guessed as t (incorrect)\n- r has been guessed as r (incorrect)\n- h has been guessed as h (incorrect)\n- w has been guessed as w (incorrect)\n- g has been guessed as g (incorrect)\n- k has been guessed as k (incorrect)\n\n### New Guesses:\nGiven that the previous guesses for these letters were incorrect, we need to try other common letters. Here are some likely candidates:\n- 😍 could be y (since e, r, m were incorrect)\n- e could be p (since e was incorrect)\n- f could be m (since f was incorrect)\n- c could be p (but e is already p, so maybe c = h)\n- u could be c (since u was incorrect)\n- t could be m (but f is m, so maybe t = p)\n- r could be t (since r was incorrect)\n- h could be c (since h was incorrect)\n- w could be w is incorrect, so maybe w = f\n- g could be g is incorrect, so maybe g = v\n- k could be k is incorrect, so maybe k = p\n\nHowever, this is getting complicated.

This is conflicting. Maybe \"e\" is \"m\" from \"continent\" → \"contimnt\" doesn't fit. Alternatively, \"e\" could be \"y\" from \"one\" → \"ony\" doesn't fit. This is confusing.)\n- \"t\" is likely \"t\" (from \"to\", \"continent\", etc.), but earlier feedback says \"t\" is incorrect. This suggests \"t\" is not \"t\".\n- \"r\" is likely \"r\" (from \"race\", \"northward\"), but earlier feedback says \"r\" is incorrect.\n- \"h\" is likely \"h\" (from \"half\"), but earlier feedback says \"h\" is incorrect.\n- \"f\" is likely \"f\" (from \"half\"), but earlier feedback says \"f\" is incorrect.\n- \"c\" is likely \"c\" (from \"continent\"), but earlier feedback says \"c\" is incorrect.\n- \"u\" is likely \"u\" (from \"united\"), but earlier feedback says \"u\" is incorrect.\n- \"g\" is likely \"g\" (from \"along\", \"great\"), but earlier feedback says \"g\" is incorrect.\n- \"k\" is likely \"k\" (from \"lakes\"), but earlier feedback says \"k\" is incorrect.\n\nGiven the conflicts, it seems the initial assumptions may be incorrect. However, based on the most plausible mappings:\n\n- \"😍\" = e (from \"earth\")\n- \"e\" = m (from \"one\" → \"onm\" doesn't fit, but no better option)\n- \"t\" = c (from \"to\" → \"co\", \"continent\" → \"concinnc\")\n- \"r\" = t (from \"race\" → \"tace\")\n- \"h\" = h (from \"half\" → \"half\")\n- \"f\" = f (from \"half\" → \"half\")\n- \"c\" = c (from \"continent\" → \"continent\")\n- \"u\" = u (from \"united\" → \"united\")\n- \"g\" = g (from \"along\" → \"along\")\n- \"k\" = k (from \"lakes\" → \"lakes\")\n\nBut earlier feedback indicates many of these are incorrect.

Here's the step-by-step approach:\n\n### 1. Given Hint:\n- 👻 = t\n\n### 2. Analyze the Encoded Sentence:\nThe encoded sentence appears to be a paragraph with words separated by spaces. Let's look for common words or patterns:\n\n- The word \"🥺n\" appears multiple times, likely representing a common short word like \"in\" or \"on\". Given that \"n\" is the second character, it might be \"in\" (🥺 = i, n = n).\n- \"👻🥶😂\" starts with 👻=t, so it could be \"the\" (🥶 = h, 😂 = e).\n- \"😇\" appears frequently, often at the end of words, suggesting it might be \"d\" or \"y\".\n- \"😂\" appears frequently, likely a vowel like \"e\" or \"a\". Given \"👻🥶😂\" = \"the\", 😂 = e.\n- \"🥶\" in \"👻🥶😂\" = \"the\" implies 🥶 = h.\n\n### 3. Guesses Based on Patterns:\n- 👻 = t (given)\n- 😂 = e (from \"the\")\n- 🥶 = h (from \"the\")\n- 🥺 = i (from \"🥺n\" = \"in\")\n- n = n (literal)\n- \"😱😇🐱🐱\" could be \"added\" or \"asked\". If 😇 = d, then \"😱dd🐱\". Maybe \"added\" (😱 = a, 🐱 = d).\n  - 😱 = a\n  - 🐱 = d\n  - 😇 = d (but this conflicts with 🐱 = d, so maybe 😇 = y).\n- Alternatively, \"😱😇🐱🐱\" could be \"apple\" or \"ally\". Not sure yet.\n- \"2006\" is likely a year, so the preceding word might be \"in\" or \"on\". We have \"🥺n\" = \"in\".\n\n### 4. Test Guesses:\nAssume:\n- 👻 = t\n- 😂 = e\n- 🥶 = h\n- 🥺 = i\n- n = n\n- \"👻🥶😂\" = \"the\"\n\nNow look at \"🥺n🤭🙄🐮🥳🙄🐮😇👻😂d\":\n- \"in🤭🙄🐮🥳🙄🐮😇teed\" (assuming last word is \"indeed\" or \"instead\").\n  - If \"indeed\":\n    - 🤭 = n\n    - 🙄 = d\n    - 🐮 = e\n    - 🥳 = e\n    - 😇 = d\n    - But 🐮 = e conflicts with 😂 = e. So maybe not \"indeed\".\n  - If \"instead\":\n    - 🤭 = s\n    - 🙄 = t\n    - 🐮 = e\n    - 🥳 = a\n    - 😇 = d\n    - But 👻 = t, so 🙄 cannot also be t. Maybe \"instead\" is incorrect.\n\nAlternative: \"in🤭🙄🐮🥳🙄🐮😇teed\" = \"in the middle\":\n- Not matching well.\n\n### 5. Look for Other Patterns:\n\"🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄\":\n- \"🐻in g😇🐰🤭🙄\":\n  - Could be \"beginning\" or \"working\". Not clear.\n\n### 6. Focus on Short Words:\n\"😇nd\":\n- Likely \"and\" (😇 = a, n = n, d = d).\n  - So 😇 = a\n  - d = d (literal)\n\nNow update:\n- 😇 = a\n- d = d\n\nNow look at \"🥺n🤭🙄🐮🥳🙄🐮😇👻😂d\":\n- \"in🤭🙄🐮🥳🙄🐮at ed\":\n  - Could be \"in the middle\":\n    - 🤭 = t (but 👻 = t, so no)\n    - Maybe \"in the end\":\n      - 🤭 = t (conflict)\n    - Maybe \"in the past\":\n      - 🤭 = p\n      - 🙄 = a\n      - 🐮 = s\n      - 🥳 = t\n      - Then \"in past at ed\" doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternative: \"in🤭🙄🐮🥳🙄🐮a ted\":\n- Maybe \"in the same\":\n  - 🤭 = h\n  - 🙄 = s\n  - 🐮 = a\n  - 🥳 = m\n  - Then \"in h s a m s a ted\" doesn't fit.\n\n### 7. Re-evaluate:\nMaybe \"🥺n\" = \"on\":\n- 🥺 = o\n- n = n\n- Then \"👻🥶😂\" = \"the\" (👻 = t, 🥶 = h, 😂 = e)\n- \"😇nd\" = \"and\" (😇 = a, n = n, d = d)\nNow \"on🤭🙄🐮🥳🙄🐮a ted\":\n- Could be \"on the same\":\n  - 🤭 = t (conflict with 👻 = t)\n  - Maybe \"on the other\":\n    - 🤭 = o\n    - 🙄 = t\n    - 🐮 = h\n    - 🥳 = e\n    - Then \"on o t h e t h a ted\" doesn't fit.\n\nThis isn't working well. Maybe \"🥺n\" = \"it\":\n- 🥺 = i\n- n = t\nBut then \"👻🥶😂\" = \"the\" (👻 = t, 🥶 = h, 😂 = e)\n\"😇nd\" = \"and\" (😇 = a, n = n, d = d)\nBut n cannot be both n and t.\n\n### 8. Stick with Initial Guesses:\nGiven time constraints, here are the most plausible guesses:\n- 👻 = t\n- 😂 = e\n- 🥶 = h\n- 🥺 = i\n- n = n\n- 😇 = a\n- d = d\n- \"😱😇🐱🐱\" = \"added\" (😱 = a, 🐱 = d, but 😇 = a conflicts with 😱 = a)\n  - Maybe \"😱😇🐱🐱\" = \"apple\" (😱 = a, 😇 = p, 🐱 = p, but duplicate p)\n  - Not sure.\n\n### 9. Submit Initial Guesses:\nBased on \"the\", \"in\", and \"and\":\n- 👻 = t\n- 😂 = e\n- 🥶 = h\n- 🥺 = i\n- n = n\n- 😇 = a\n- d = d\n\nAnswer: 👻=t,😂=e,🥶=h,🥺=i,n=n,😇=a,d=d","Based on the provided information and feedback from the previous guess, let's analyze and make corrections:\n\n1.

The word \"🥺n\" appears multiple times. Since 🥺 = i, this is likely \"in\" or \"it\". But 'n' is not 'n' or 's' or 'o', so let's try 'n' = 'n' again (even though it was marked as False in Guess 1, but maybe it was a misinterpretation).\n   - Alternatively, if 'n' is 'm', then \"🥺n\" = \"im\", which is less likely.\n   - Another possibility is 'n' = 'f' (from \"if\"), but 🐦 was guessed as 'f' and was incorrect.\n   - Let's tentatively assume 'n' = 'n' (despite earlier feedback).\n\n2. \"👻🥶😂\" = \"the\" (👻=t, 🥶=h, 😂=e), which makes sense.\n\n3. \"😇nd\" = \"a??\". Common words like \"and\", \"any\", \"ant\". 'd' is not 'd' or 'y', so possibly 'd' = 'n' (but 'n' is already taken). Maybe 'd' = 's' (for \"ans\" is unlikely), or 'd' = 'd' (despite earlier feedback).\n\n4. \"🤩😂🐮😂\" = \"we?e\". Likely \"were\" or \"when\". If 🐮 = 'r', then \"were\". Let's try 🐮 = 'r'.\n\n5. \"🥺n🤭🙄🐮🥳🙄🐮😇👻😂d\" = \"in????r?a?te?\". This is likely \"international\" or similar. But this seems too long. Maybe \"in the middle\"? Not sure.\n\n6. \"👻🙄\" = \"t?\".

So:\n   - 🤭 = 'f'\n   - 🥳 = 'm'\n   - 🐮 = 'r'\n   - 🙄 = 'o'\n\n9. Now check \"😇nd\" = \"and\". So 'd' = 'd' (despite earlier feedback saying 'd' was False when guessed as 'd').

The word \"🥺n\" appears multiple times. Given 🥺=i, likely \"in\" (so n=n)\n\n4. \"😇nd\" is likely \"and\" (😇=a, so d=d)\n\n5. \"2006\" is clearly a year, so the word before it \"🙄😱\" is likely \"of\" (🙄=o, 😱=f)\n\n6. \"🤭😇🐭😂🐮gn🙄\" - with 🤭=l, 😇=a, 🐭=u, 😂=e, 🐮=r, n=n, 🙄=o → \"laur?go\" - likely \"lauregon\" (but this doesn't make sense).

Looking at the word \"bee💩\" which is likely \"beer\" (common word), suggesting 💩 = e (though this was marked false in attempt 1, but might be worth reconsidering)\n\n3. \"32 g😍e💩a😇😂e😍🙄\" likely \"great something\" - if 😍=r, 💩=a, 😇=t, 🙄=d, then \"great idea\" but this contradicts previous feedback\n\n4. \"fo😍ce\" would be \"force\" if 💩=c, but this contradicts previous feedback\n\n5. \"😇e🐨ac🐶me💩🐨\" - if 😇=a, 🐨=c, 🐶=o, 💩=m, then \"academic\" but this contradicts previous feedback\n\nGiven the contradictions in previous attempts, let's try a new approach focusing on words we can reasonably guess:\n\n- \"bee💩\" is likely \"beer\" → 💩 = r (but 😍 is already r)\n- Maybe \"beef\" → 💩 = f\n- \"fo😍ce\" = \"force\" (😍=r) → f is already first letter, so 💩 would need to be c\n- \"32 g😍e💩a😇😂e😍🙄\" - if \"gr💩a😇ierd\" - maybe \"gradient\"?\n   - g r a d i e n t\n   - So 💩=a, 😇=d, 🙄=t\n\nBut previous attempts show 💩=a was incorrect.

Since 🐨≠h and 🐶≠t, it's probably not \"hey\". Maybe \"they\" (🐨=t, 🐶=h)?\n   - But 🐶 was guessed as 't' before and was incorrect, so maybe not.\n\n2. \"bee💩\" - likely \"bees\" or \"beef\". Since 💩≠e, maybe \"bees\" (💩=s)?\n\n3. \"32 g😍e💩a😇😂e😍🙄\" - 😍=r, 😂=i, so \"g r e 💩 a 😇 i r 🙄\". Could be \"great minds\" (💩=a, 😇=m, 🙄=d)? But 💩 was guessed as 'a' before and was incorrect.\n\n4. \"🙄ummo💩e😇\" - 🙄=?, 💩=?, 😇=?. Could be \"summoned\" (🙄=s, 💩=m, 😇=d)?\n\n5. \"14 👻uly\" - 👻=J, so \"July\".\n\nGiven the feedback from the last attempt, let's try:\n- 💩 = s (from \"bees\")\n- 🐨 = t (from \"they\")\n- 🐶 = h (from \"they\")\n- 😇 = d (from \"summoned\")\n- 🙄 = m (from \"great minds\")\n- 🤠 = W (from \"Walmart\" or similar, but was incorrect before)\n- 🦊 = f (from \"first\", but was incorrect before)\n\nBut some of these were incorrect before. Let's try a new approach:\n\nFrom \"bee💩\", if it's \"beer\" (💩=r), but 😍=r, so no. \"bees\" (💩=s) seems likely.\n\nFrom \"😍e😂💩fo😍ce😇\" (r i 💩 f o r c e 😇) - could be \"rigorous\" (💩=g, 😇=s)?\n\nNot sure. Let's try:\n\nAnswer: 😍=r,😂=i,👻=J,🐵=v,💩=s,🐨=t,😇=d,🙄=m,🐶=h,🤠=W,🦊=f\n\nThis is a tentative guess based on \"they\", \"bees\", and \"summoned\". \n\nAnswer: 😍=r,😂=i,👻=J,🐵=v,💩=s,🐨=t,😇=d,🙄=m,🐶=h,🤠=W,🦊=f","Based on the feedback from previous attempts and the current state of the game, here's my analysis and guess for this round:\n\n1.

With previous guesses ruling out 'e' and 's', possible letters could be 'a', 'm', etc.\n   - \"fo😍ce😇\" - \"force\" + a letter, likely \"forced\" (with 😇=d)\n   - \"me💩a😍y\" - with 😍=r, this looks like \"me_ary\" or \"me_ery\". Possible words: \"merry\", \"meary\" (less likely), \"meery\" (variant of merry)\n   - \"ummo💩e😇\" - with 😇=d, looks like \"ummo_e_d\". Possible: \"ummosed\" (unlikely), \"ummomed\" (unlikely), \"ummoked\" (unlikely). Maybe \"ummowed\"?\n   - \"🤠a😍😂🙄\" - with known letters: \"_ar_is\". Possible: \"war is\", making 🤠=w\n\n3. From \"bee💩\", if we try 💩=m, then \"beem\" is not a word, but \"beam\" is possible, suggesting 💩=a.\n\n4. Testing these:\n   - 🤠=w (from \"war is\")\n   - 💩=a (from \"beam\")\n\n5. Checking other words:\n   - \"🐨🐶ey\" = \"they\" (🐨=t, 🐶=h)\n   - \"🐶owe🐵e😍\" = \"hover\" (🐶=h, 🐵=v, 😍=r)\n   - \"bee💩\" = \"bea_\" with 💩=a → \"bea_\" doesn't make sense, so maybe 💩=m (\"beem\" still not a word)\n   - Alternatively, maybe 💩=l (\"beel\" not a word) or 💩=k (\"beek\" not standard)\n\nGiven the difficulties with \"bee💩\", let's try 💩=m despite it not forming a standard word, as other options seem worse.\n\nAnswer: 😍=r,😂=i,👻=J,🐵=v,🐨=t,😇=d,🐶=h,🙄=s,🦊=k,🤠=w,💩=m","Based on the feedback from previous attempts and the current encoded sentence, here's my analysis and guess for this round:\n\n1. From the feedback, we know the following emojis are correctly mapped:\n   - 😍=r\n   - 😂=i\n   - 👻=J\n   - 🐵=v\n   - 🐨=t\n   - 😇=d\n   - 🐶=h\n   - 🙄=s\n   - 🦊=k\n\n2. Looking at the encoded sentence, \"bee💩\" likely stands for \"been\" or \"beer\". Since 😍=r, and \"beer\" would require another 'e', it's more likely \"been\", suggesting 💩=n.\n\n3. \"32 g😍e💩a😇😂e😍🙄\" could be \"32 grenadier\" (a military term), which would fit with:\n   - g😍e💩a😇😂e😍🙄 = grenadier\n   - This would require:\n     - a = e\n     - But we already have 😇=d, so this doesn't fit. Alternatively, \"32 grenadiers\" would require s at the end, but we have 🙄=s.\n\n4. \"f😍om\" could be \"from\" (with o already mapped to something), but we don't have o mapped yet.\n\n5. \"me😍ce💩\" could be \"mercen\" (part of \"mercenary\"), suggesting 💩=n.\n\n6. \"😇e🐨ac🐶me💩🐨\" could be \"detachment\" (with some letters missing), which would fit with:\n   - d e t a c h m e n t\n   - 😇=d, e, 🐨=t, a, c, 🐶=h, m, e, 💩=n, 🐨=t\n\nThis suggests:\n- a = a\n- c = c\n- m = m\n- e = e\n- o = o\n\nGiven this, my guess for this round is:\n\nAnswer: 😍=r,😂=i,👻=J,🐵=v,🐨=t,😇=d,🐶=h,🙄=s,🦊=k,💩=n,🤠=w,a=a,c=c,m=m,e=e,o=o","Based on the feedback from previous guesses and the encoded sentence, here's my analysis and answer for this round:\n\n1. Correct emoji-letter pairs from history:\n   - 😍=r\n   - 😂=i\n   - 👻=J\n   - 🐵=v\n   - 🐨=t\n   - 😇=d\n   - 🐶=h\n   - 🙄=s\n   - 🦊=k\n   - 💩=n\n\n2. New guesses based on the sentence context:\n   - 'bee💩' likely decodes to 'been' (since 💩=n)\n   - 'fo😍ce' likely decodes to 'force' (since 😍=r)\n   - 'g😍e💩a😇😂e😍🙄' could be 'grenadier' (g + r + e + n + a + d + i + e + r + s)\n   - '🤠a😍😂🙄' could be 'war is' or similar, suggesting 🤠=w\n   - 'me😍ce💩a😍y' could be 'mercenary' (m + e + r + c + e + n + a + r + y)\n\n3. New emoji-letter assignments:\n   - 🤠=w (consistent with previous attempts)\n   - e=e (from 'bee💩' = 'been')\n   - a=a (from 'grenadier')\n   - y=y (from 'mercenary')\n   - o=o (from 'fo😍ce' = 'force')\n   - m=m (from 'me😍ce💩a😍y' = 'mercenary')\n   - c=c (from 'me😍ce💩a😍y' = 'mercenary')\n   - f=f (from 'fo😍ce' = 'force')\n   - b=b (from 'bee💩' = 'been')\n   - g=g (from 'g😍e💩a😇😂e😍🙄' = 'grenadier')\n\nAnswer: 😍=r,😂=i,👻=J,🐵=v,🐨=t,😇=d,🐶=h,🙄=s,🦊=k,💩=n,🤠=w,e=e,a=a,y=y,o=o,m=m,c=c,f=f,b=b,g=g"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
