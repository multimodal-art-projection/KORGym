Let's focus on a different part. What's the word 'a 😇e🐨ac🐶me💩🐨'? Since we know a,d,t,h,n,t we can see it probably means 'a detachment'\n\nSo😍=r,🐶=h,💩=n,😇=d,🐨=t,🙄=s,😂=e\n\nNow the sentence is\nthr had towmrer been reinforced by a detachment of 32 grenadiers from one of the swiss mercenary regiments summoned to garis by the living leg hoearthly before 14 july.\n\nThis also doesn't give much clarity.\n\nIt looks like 😂 = e, so let us try to find out what 'owe🐵e' means since we also know 😍=r. Also 'o💩e' should be one. So 🐨🐶e = the. Now we have 🐨=t,🐶=h.\nLet's analyze owere . It is probably somewhere. So let's try w=m. This is where we can try o=s .\nso o💩e can be one.\n\nOkay.

It's likely that 🐼 represents a vowel. \"tan\" doesn't look right given it is repeated, so it's unlikely to be just \"tan\". Could it be \"tall\"?\n\nMaybe 🐼=l. This gives \"tall\". Then the sentence becomes: tall defeatet af snot (5: 20) tall forced snot to submit sith the tallmission.\n\n\"defeatet\" indicates 🐸=e. But, 'defeated' makes more sense.

Based on the third word \"🐔🐔e\", it's likely to be the word \"the\". Then \"🐔=t\". The first word \"🐹at\" is likely to be \"that\". So \"🐹=h\". Therefore, the sentence looks like this now:\n\nhatthe🥺😴ei n🥶athe🤑🥺t ohe🥶ano🧐 no 🦆oi🐼et 🤥🥺n🤑🤠 1983.\n\nThe word \"no\" following the \"ohe\" may represent \"one\".

There are some single emoji words (🐱🐦 and 😱🤮). Also, there are repeated patterns, which might indicate common words. Let's start with some likely candidates and see if they fit.\n\nBased on the frequency and context, here's my first guess:\n\nAnswer: 🤖=e, 🐦=s, 😱=i, 👽=n, 😇=a, 🐶=t, 🤮=o, 🦆=w, 🐧=d, 🐱=h, 😍=m, 🐵=c, 🤠=r, 🐸=y, 🐔=b, 🤓=l, 🥵=k, 🐷=u, 🐨=g, 🦉=f, 🐻=p, 🦁=x, 🙄=v\n","Okay, I will analyze the encoded sentence, the hint, and the previous guess to make a more informed guess this round.\n\nBased on the previous attempt, the following were correct: 🤖=e, 🐦=s, 🦉=f, 🙄=v\n\nEncoded Sentence: 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦 🐱🐦 😱🤮 😱🐶🐦🐸😇😱🐧🐱😱🤮 🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸 🦆🐔😱🐱🤮 👽🤓🤮🤖🥵 🐷🐨 🤓🤖🐦🦉😱😇🐵🤖😇🐦 (🦉👽😇🐵🤖😇🐧🐨 🦆👽🐧🤖🐦 🐻😇👽🐶😍 🐷🤖🦉👽😇🤖 🐱🐸🐦 😱🦆🦁🐶🐱🐦🐱🐸🐱👽🤮 👽🤮 23 🤮👽🙄🤖🐵🐷🤖😇 2007).\n\nLet's incorporate the confirmed letters into the sentence to see what patterns emerge.\n\nw n d e s s t m e a c i a r e y s h s i o i t s y a i d h i o s t m e a c i a r e y w b i h o n l o e k u g l e s f a c e a s (f n a c e a d g w n d e s p a n t m e a c e h y s i w x t h s h y h n o n o v e c u a i 2007).\n\nThe sentence now reads: \"w n d e s s t m e a c i a r e y s h s i o i t s y a i d h i o s t m e a c i a r e y w b i h o n l o e k u g l e s f a c e a s (f n a c e a d g w n d e s p a n t m e a c e h y s i w x t h s h y h n o n o v e c u a i 2007).\"\n\nAnalyzing this, I see \"a c i a r e y\", which is repeating again and again, maybe it is the end of the word \"secretary\". Thus, 😇=t, 😱=r, 🐵=a, 🤠=r, 🐸=y\nBut we knew that 🤠=r is incorrect, 😱=i incorrect,😇=a incorrect, so let's analyze \"a c i a\", perhaps it ends with \"ica\". So we could guess 😱=c 😇=a 🐵=i\nlet's analyze \"f n a c e a d g\", perhaps it is \"financed g\" or \"financed in\". Thus, 👽=n, 🐧=d\n\nI also notice \"t m e a c i a r e y w\" could potentially translate to \"the secretary w\", which leads me to believe that 'w' could be 'who'. Thus, 🦆=w.\n\nLet's further analyze the patterns. Given 'robot' is likely 'year', it would be sensible that the second last word is year.\n\nSo, let's update our understanding : 🤖=e, 🐦=s, 🦉=f, 🙄=v, 👽=n, 🐧=d, 😱=c, 😇=a, 🐵=i, 🦆=w\n\nNow the sentence reads: w n d e s s t m e a c i a r e y s h s i o i t s y a i d h i o s t m e a c i a r e y w b i h o n l o e k u g l e s f a c e a s (f n a c e a d g w n d e s p a n t m e a c e h y s i w x t h s h y h n o n o v e c u a i 2007).\n\nIncorporating these, it is\n\"w n d e s s t m e a i i a r e y s h s i o i t s y a i d h i o s t m e a i i a r e y w b i h o n l o e k u g l e s f a i e a s (f n a i e a d g w n d e s p a n t m e a i e h y s i w x t h s h y h n o n o v e i u a i 2007).\"\n\nLet's make the following guesses based on these deductions:\n👽=n, 🐧=d, 😱=c, 😇=a, 🐵=i, 🦆=w, 🤖=e\n\nAnswer: 👽=n, 🐧=d, 😱=c, 😇=a, 🐵=i, 🦆=w, 🤖=e, 🐦=s, 🦉=f, 🙄=v\n","OK, I will analyze the game board and the history to make the most reasonable guess.\n\nFrom the encoded sentence:\n- 🤖 appears very frequently.\n- 🐦 appears frequently.\n- 😱 appears frequently.\n- 😇 appears frequently.\n\nFrom the history:\nAttempt 1 had many guesses, but only 🤖=e, 🐦=s, 🦉=f, 🙄=v were correct.\nAttempt 2 only refined the existing correct mappings.\n\nThe current encoded sentence, with known letters filled in:\n🦆👽🐧e🐦 🐦🐶😍e😇🐵😱😇🤠e🐸🐦 🐱🐦 😱🤮 😱🐶🐦🐸😇😱🐧🐱😱🤮 🐦🐶😍e😇🐵😱😇🤠e🐸 🦆🐔😱🐱🤮 👽🤓🤮e🥵 🐷🐨 🤓e🐦🦉😱😇🐵e😇🐦 (🦉👽😇🐵e😇🐧🐨 🦆👽🐧e🐦 🐻😇👽🐶😍 🐷e🦉👽😇e 🐱🐸🐦 😱🦆🦁🐶🐱🐦🐱🐸🐱👽🤮 👽🤮 23 🤮👽🙄e🐵🐷e😇 2007).\nbecomes:\n🦆👽🐧es s🐶😍ea🐵😱arer🐸s 🐱s 😱🤮 😱🐶s🐸a😱🐧🐱😱🤮 s🐶😍ea🐵😱arer🐸 🦆🐔😱🐱🤮 👽🤓🤮ek 🐷🐨 🤓esf😱ea🐵ea🐦 (fs👽aea🐵ea🐧🐨 🦆👽🐧es 🐻aa👽🐶😍 🐷ef👽ae 🐱🐸s 😱🦆🦁🐶🐱ss🐱🐸🐱👽🤮 👽🤮 23 🤮👽ves🐵🐷ea 2007).\n\nLooking at \"s🐶😍ea🐵😱arer🐸s\", a possible word is \"something\".

Since 'the' is a very common word, and we know 'e' maps to '💩', I will look for sequences with 💩 in them. For example, t🐭💩. It is probable it means 'the'. So I guess t🐭💩 = the. It follows t=t, 🐭=h.

Therefore, 🐶 could be 'o', 🧐 could be 'u', and the next character, t, might be \"e.\" Based on the word pattern, it seems more like \"accountance\", which might be accounting, and that makes 🥵 a g.\n\nSince we know 🐶 is 'o' and it makes \"to\" when combined with t🐭, 🐭 is i.\n\nNow the sentence looks like:\n\nf**ro**🤑 t**i**e 🤗**oro**🤮 **a**cco**u**nt**a**nt t**i**e t**er**🤑 **a**cco**u**nt**a**ncg 🙄🐵 🤮**ero**🙄🤥**e**🤮.\n\nThen the first word might be \"from\" so 🤑 = m.\n\nThen the sentence looks like:\n\nf**rom** t**i**e 🤗**oro**🤮 **a**cco**u**nt**a**nt t**i**e t**erm** **a**cco**u**nt**a**ncg 🙄🐵 🤮**ero**🙄🤥**e**🤮.\n\nThen t is \"h\" and 🤗 is \"i\".\n\nThen the sentence looks like:\n\nf**rom** th**e** **i**oro🤮 **a**cco**u**nt**a**nt th**e term** **a**cco**u**nt**a**ncg 🙄🐵 🤮**ero**🙄🤥**e**🤮.\n\nSo, I am going to make these assumptions: 🐶=o, 🐭=i, 🤑=m, 🤗=i, t=h, 🧐=u, 🥵=g\n\nAnswer: 💩=e, 🐰=r, 😂=a, 🐶=o, 🐭=i, 🤑=m, 🤗=i, 🧐=u, 🥵=g\n","Okay, I understand the game.

That could be \"iory,\" \"lory,\" \"sorry\". Let's try l since we haven't used it. So, 🤗=l, 🤮=y\nAlso, let's look at the last word \"🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮\" which is \"y er wdel\". That could be \"yesterday\". It seems like a likely candidate. Hence, 🙄=t, 🤥=d.\n\nNow the encoded sentence is: f🐰🐶🤑 t🐭💩 🤗🐶🐰🤮 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt t🐭💩 t💩🐰🤑 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nc🥵 🙄🐵 🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮.\nBecomes: \"f rom nhe lory auuonunt nhe nerm auuonuny ts yesterday.\" \"f\" seems to be \"it\". Hence, f=i, t=n, 🤗=l, 🤮=y, 🙄=t, 🤥=d. Since this is 7th try, I need to be more careful. Let's try to find the word which could make sense. The encoded sentence is \"f rom nhe lory auuonunt nhe nerm auuonuny ts yesterday\". It looks very close. Now \"auuonunt\" means \"account\". So, c must be 'c', this gives \"it from the lory account nhe nerm accounty ts yesterday\". It doesn't make sense. \"lory\" looks incorrect. Let's try \"is\". So, 🤗=s, 🤮=f. \"If from the story account the term accounty ts yesterday.\". So t=n, 🙄=t, 🤥=d. The first word could be \"if\". Hence, f=i.\nThe last word is \"yesterday\", so, 🙄=s, 🤥=d.\n\nFinal Answer:\nf=i, 🐰=r, 🐶=o, 🤑=m, t=n, 🐭=h, 💩=e, 🤗=s, 🤮=f, 😂=a, 🧐=u, 🥵=y, 🙄=t, 🐵=s, 🤥=d\nThis yields the sentence: \"if from the story account the term accounty ts yesterday.\"\nAnswer: f=i, 🐰=r, 🐶=o, 🤑=m, t=n, 🐭=h, 💩=e, 🤗=s, 🤮=f, 😂=a, 🧐=u, 🥵=y, 🙄=t, 🐵=s, 🤥=d\n","Let's analyze the encoded sentence and the feedback from previous attempts to make a more informed guess.\n\nCurrent State:\n- Encoded Sentence: f🐰🐶🤑 t🐭💩 🤗🐶🐰🤮 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt t🐭💩 t💩🐰🤑 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nc🥵 🙄🐵 🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮.\n- Known Letters: 💩=e, 🐰=r, 😂=a, 🐶=o, 🤑=m, 🐭=h, 🧐=u, 🐵=s, 🥵=y\n\nBased on the decoded letters, we have the partial sentence:\n`f r o m t h e  ? o r l a cc o u nt a nt t h e t e r m a cc o u ncy t s l e r t ? e r t`\n\nLooking at the word \"acc o u ncy\", it likely finishes as \"accuracy\", so 🥵 = c, and given the previous guesses for f being wrong, and the two letter word, f could be it and therefore 🤗 is likely to be i. So, `f r o m t h e i o r l a cc o u nt a nt t h e t e r m a cc o u nccy t ? s l e r t ? e r t`. Also, seeing the last word \"e r t\", and considering we are attempting the 8th guess, let's try \"end\". So 🙄=n, 🤥=d, and 🤮=d. Finally, that would make t to be d, but it's already used by 🤥. Thus, instead of ending with \"ert\", the end is probably going to be \"est\". Thus 🙄=b, 🤥=s, and 🤮=t.\n\nTherefore we can deduce that the current answer is:\nf=i, 🐰=r, 🐶=o, 🤑=m, t=n, 🐭=h, 💩=e, 🤗=i, 🤮=t, 😂=a, 🧐=u, 🥵=c, 🙄=b, 🐵=s, 🤥=s\n\n```\nAnswer: f=i,🐰=r,🐶=o,🤑=m,t=n,🐭=h,💩=e,🤗=i,🤮=t,😂=a,🧐=u,🥵=c,🙄=b,🐵=s,🤥=d\n```","Based on the history, let's analyze the feedback and make an educated guess.

I will analyze the encoded sentence, use the hint provided (👽=e), and submit my first guess, including the given hint. Since this is the first attempt, and no correct answers are available in history, I'll make a reasonable guess based on the sentence structure and frequency analysis, focusing on common words. Given the frequency of '🐶' and the hint '👽=e', it's plausible '🐶' could represent a common short word like 'the' or 'and'. I'll guess '🐶=t'. I will also make a guess about '💩' which also occurs frequently, let's assume it is 's'.\n\nAnswer: 👽=e, 🐶=t, 💩=s\n","Okay, I understand the game. Based on the encoded sentence, the hint (👽=e), and the previous guess (👽=e, 🐶=t, 💩=s) with feedback indicating that 👽 and 🐶 are correct, but 💩 is incorrect, I will make a new guess.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n*   We know: 👽=e, 🐶=t.\n*   The sentence structure gives some clues. For instance, \"n🦁🐶👽 🐶😍💩🐶 🐶🐹🦁\" likely translates to \"n🦁te t😍s🐶 t🐹🦁\".\n*   Given the sentence context and common words, \"t😍s🐶\" could be \"those\". Therefore, 😍=h and 💩 must be something else.\n*   \"t🐹🦁\" at the start of a clause sounds like \"the\". So, 🐹=h and 🦁=h is very unlikely, the word must start with another letter.\n*   Let's try to infer more words and try 🦁 as \"a\".\n*   Given that 👽=e, 🐶=t and 🦁=a, 'n🦁🐶👽 🐶😍💩🐶 🐶🐹🦁' can be read as 'nate th?t th?a'\n*   The end phrase: '🤩n🐶🦁 🤔💩n🤭💩r🐰.' could be '?nta ?s?a?r.' it suggests that 🤩=i 🤔=c 🤭=g 💩=i 🐰=k\n\nMy guess is:\n\nAnswer: 👽=e, 🐶=t, 😍=h, 🦁=a, 🤩=i, 🤔=c, 🤭=g, 💩=n, 🐹=o, 🦆=f, 🤓=r, 😂=w, 🥵=m, 🤥=d, 🐰=k\n","Okay, I will analyze the encoded sentence, the hint, and the history to make a guess for this round.\n\nBased on the history:\n- 👽 = e\n- 🐶 = t\n- 😍 = h\n- 🤩 = i\n\nFrom the first attempt, we know that 💩 is not 's'.\nFrom the second attempt, we know that 🦁 is not 'a', 💩 is not 'n', 🤔 is not 'c', 🤭 is not 'g', 🐹 is not 'o', 🦆 is not 'f', 🤓 is not 'r', 😂 is not 'w', 🥵 is not 'm', 🤥 is not 'd', and 🐰 is not 'k'.\n\nLet's consider the encoded sentence: \"n🦁🐶👽 🐶😍💩🐶 🐶🐹🦁 s🐶🦁r🦆s 🦁n r👽🤓🦁rd, 😍🤭rr🤩🤓💩n👽 💩l🤩🤓👽 🤮r🦁🦆 🐶😍👽 1954 s👽💩s🦁n 💩nd 🐶r🦁p🤩🤓💩l s🐶🦁r🦆 😂👽🐶💩 🤮r🦁🦆 🐶😍👽 2005 s👽💩s🦁n 😍💩🤥👽 🤮🦁r🦆👽d d🤭r🤩n🥵 d👽🤓👽🦆b👽r 💩nd l💩s🐶👽d 🤩n🐶🦁 🤔💩n🤭💩r🐰.\"\n\nWe have \"n🦁t👽 t😍💩t t🐹🦁 st🦁r🦆s 🦁n r👽🤓🦁rd\".  This looks like \"n*te th*n*t t** o*a sta*fs an re*ard...\". I notice the word \"the\" shows up quite a bit as \"t😍\". Let's try 🦁=s, and see what we get.\n\nNow, we have \"nst he*t ts stfs sn re*ard\".  Let's also try to fill out words we see.\n\n- \"🤮r🦁🦆\" appears multiple times. It looks like \"for\" or \"was\", and given context clues, for seems more likely. If so, 🤮 = f, 🦆 = r.\n\nNow we have: \"nst het ts strrs sn rerard\".\n\nThe sentence is: \"nst the te host sstrrs sn rerard, h*rr*in* *line frr the 1954 sesn snd tr*pine ster frr the 2005 sesn h*lde drrins de*ebre snd liste ini*\".\n\nWe can see that \"s👽💩s🦁n\" appears repeatedly and now is \"ses*sn\". Let's try 💩 = o.\n\nNow the sentence is: \"nst the te host strs so rerard, h*rring *line frr the 1954 seson sond tr*pine ster frr the 2005 seson h*lde drrins de*ebre sond liste ini*\".\n\nWe need to assign more to common letters to continue and that's the best logical path forward.\n\nHere is my guess for this round:\n\nAnswer: 👽=e, 🐶=t, 😍=h, 🦁=s, 🤩=i, 💩=o, 🦆=r, 🤮=f, n=w, 🤓=a, 🐹=m, 😂=p, 🤭=u, 🥵=g, 🤥=l, 🤔=c, 🐰=k\n","Based on the history and the current encoded sentence, let's make some educated guesses.\n\nWe know:\n*   👽 = e\n*   🐶 = t\n*   😍 = h\n*   🤩 = i\n*   🤭 = u\n*   🤮 = f\n*   🥵 = g\n\nFrom attempt 3, we can analyze the feedback and the encoded sentence:\n\nThe sentence starts with 'n🦁🐶👽'. Since we know 🐶 = t and 👽 = e, this decodes to 'n🦁te'. It's likely 'note', 'late' or 'date'. Let's consider the most common words.\n\nLooking at the sentence structure and the frequency of emojis, let's try to fill in some likely words.\n\nConsider '😍💩🤥👽'. We know 😍 = h and 👽 = e. So we have 'h💩🤥e'. This could be 'hope', 'have', 'hate'.\n\nLet's try these assumptions, and start focusing on common words.\n\nI will try the following:\n*   🦁 = a (common letter)\n*   💩 = n (since it appears frequently next to 'h' for a word to begin with 'ha')\n*   🦆 = r (to make 'for' at the start of the encoded sentence)\n*   🤓 = d\n\nAnswer: 👽=e, 🐶=t, 😍=h, 🦁=a, 🤩=i, 💩=n, 🦆=r, 🤮=f, 🤓=d, 🤭=u, 🥵=g\n","Okay, based on the game board, rules, and history, I will provide my next guess.\n\nGiven the encoded sentence and the history, I'll try to deduce the remaining emojis. From attempt 4, we know 👽=e, 🐶=t, 😍=h, 🤩=i, 🤭=u, 🥵=g, 🤮=f. Looking at the encoded sentence, 'n🦁🐶👽 🐶😍💩🐶 🐶🐹🦁 s🐶🦁r🦆s', and considering what we know, we can make an educated guess for 🦁. It's highly likely that 🦁=s. Then we can guess 💩=d.\n\nSo, the answer is:\nAnswer: 👽=e, 🐶=t, 😍=h, 🦁=s, 🤩=i, 💩=d, 🤭=u, 🥵=g, 🤮=f\n","Okay, based on the current game state and history, let's make another guess.

This means 💩 could be a vowel. Also \"d🤭r🤩n🥵\" would translate to \"during\". Based on feedback on previous attempts, 💩 is not 'n'. Let's try 💩=d.\n\nLet's also revisit previous incorrect guesses and try to make better deductions:\n- From Attempt 1: 💩 is not s.\n- From Attempt 2: 🦁 is not a, 🤔 is not c, 🐹 is not o, 🦆 is not f, 🤓 is not r, 😂 is not w, 🤥 is not d, 🐰 is not k\n- From Attempt 3: n is not w, 🤓 is not a, 🐹 is not m, 😂 is not p, 🤥 is not l\n- From Attempt 4: 🦁 is not a, 🤓 is not d\n- From Attempt 5: 🦁 is not s\n- From Attempt 6: 🦁 is not a, 🦆 is not o, 🤓 is not r, n is not w\n\nWith 💩=d, we have \"the td\". The first word is likely 'in'. So n=i. The word \"s🐶🦁r🦆s\" could be \"starts\", which means 🦁=a and 🦆=r. The word \"rd\" could be \"rd\" -> \"and\".

Common short words beginning with 'w' are: 'was', 'who', 'why', 'will'. We can rule out 'was' because attempt 4 indicates that 🐶 can't be s. Let's explore other options in the next attempt.\n\nBased on the given attempts and feedback, I'll revise my guess and try another combination of letters.\n\nAnswer: 👽=n, 🐻=d, 🤖=v, 🦁=h, 🤭=y, 🐨=r, 🐶=e\n","Okay, let's analyze the current state of the game.\n\nThe encoded sentence is: 🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\nThe hint is: 👽=n\n\nBased on the history:\n- Attempt 1: 👽=n, 🐵=I, 🦆=a, 🤭=i, 🐨=s, 🤖=o (👽 was correct)\n- Attempt 2: 👽=n, 🤭=i, 🤖=o, 🐻=d (👽 and 🐻 were correct)\n- Attempt 3: 👽=n, 🐻=d, 🤖=e, 🦆=f, 🤭=u, 🐨=r, 🐶= , 🦁=h, 🐵=H (👽, 🐻 and 🦁 were correct)\n- Attempt 4: 👽=n, 🐻=d, 🤖=i, 🦁=h, 🐵=I, 🦆=a, 🤭=t, 🐨=o, 🐶=s (👽, 🐻 and 🦁 were correct)\n- Attempt 5: 👽=n, 🐻=d, 🤖=v, 🦁=h, 🤭=y, 🐨=r, 🐶=e (👽, 🐻 and 🦁 were correct)\n\nCurrently, we know:\n- 👽 = n\n- 🐻 = d\n- 🦁 = h\n\nLet's substitute these into the encoded sentence:\n🐵. s. in🦆🤭l🦆eernt in the w🤖🐶 c🤭roes t🤭 🤖n end.\n\nNow, let's re-evaluate the previous guesses. It looks like attempt 3 had the most correct.\nLet's try to refine that:\n\nGiven the current state, 'c🤭roes t🤭 🤖n end' looks like it could be 'cross then end'. That would imply 🤭=s, 🤖=e, 🐨=o.\nThen 'in🦆slo🦆ernt in the w🤖🐶' could be 'in folds or not in the w🐶e'. That implies 🦆=f, 🐶=b.\n\n🐵. s. in folds or not in the web cross then end.\n\n'🐵' must be 'I' since it is at the beginning of a sentence and is capitalized. Also we can infer from the second word 's' that is must be 'It', therefore we can infer that s=t.\n\nIt is in folds or not in the web cross then end.\n\nTherefore, the current guess includes:\n👽=n, 🐻=d, 🦁=h, 🤭=s, 🤖=e, 🐨=o, 🦆=f, 🐶=b, 🐵=I, s=t\n\nAnswer: 👽=n, 🐻=d, 🦁=h, 🤭=s, 🤖=e, 🐨=o, 🦆=f, 🐶=b, 🐵=I, s=t\n","Okay, let's analyze the current state of the game and make a guess based on the information.\n\nThe encoded sentence is: 🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\nWe know that 👽=n, and we are trying to decipher the rest.\n\nHere's what we can infer from the previous attempts:\n\n*   Attempt 1: Incorrect guesses for 🐵, 🦆, 🤭, 🐨, and 🤖.\n*   Attempt 2: 🐻=d is correct.\n*   Attempt 3: 🦁=h is correct.\n*   Attempt 4: 🐻=d and 🦁=h are correct.\n*   Attempt 5: 🐻=d and 🦁=h are correct.\n*   Attempt 6: 🐻=d, 🦁=h are correct.\n\nLet's look at the sentence with the known letters:\n\n🐵. s. in🦆🤭l🦆ee🐨ent in the w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖n end.\n\nGiven the context, \"in\" is a strong indicator for filling some slots.\n\n'es' could be 'is' or 'as' so that gives us a shot.\n\nLet's try 🤭=i, 🐨=s, 🤖=a, and see if that fits:\n\n🐵. s. in🦆islaeesent in the wa🐶 cis is an end.\n\n\"wa🐶\" could be \"way\".\n\nLet's guess with 🐵=I, 🤭=i, 🐨=s, 🤖=a, 🐶=y and 🦆=g:\n\nI. t. ingislageesent in the way cisis an end.\n\nThis does not make much sense.\n\nLet's look at it again:\n\n🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\nI. t. in🦆🤭l🦆eesent in the wh🐶 cis es ti an end.\n\nLet's try the following guess, focusing on making more sense of the words given what is known and also giving the highest frequency.\n\n🐵=I, s=t, 👽=n, 🦆=g, 🤭=o, 🐨=m, 🤖=a, 🐶=s, 🦁=h, 🐻=d\n\nAnswer: 👽=n, 🐻=d, 🦁=h, 🐵=I, s=t, 🦆=g, 🤭=o, 🐨=m, 🤖=a, 🐶=s\n","Okay, based on the current game state, here's my guess:\n\n👽=n, 🐻=d, 🦁=h, 🤭=o, 🤖=a, 🐨=m, 🐶=t, 🦆=g, 🐵=I, s=i\n\nAnswer: 👽=n,🐻=d,🦁=h,🤭=o,🤖=a,🐨=m,🐶=t,🦆=g,🐵=I,s=i\n","Okay, I will analyze the provided information and make an educated guess.\n\nBased on the encoded sentence and the history of guesses, here's what I know:\n\n*   **Encoded Sentence:** 🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\n*   **Current Hint:** 👽 = n\n*   **History:** A lot of guesses have failed, but some are correct! Here's what is confirmed correct from previous tries:\n    *   👽 = n\n    *   🐻 = d\n    *   🦁 = h\n    *   🤭 = o\n    *   🤖 = a\n    *   🐨 = m\n\nNow incorporating this into the Encoded Sentence:\n\n🐵. s. in🦆omo🦆e🐜e🐜t in the wa🐶 comoes to an end.\n\nThe sentence is still not very clear, but the words ending in 'es' look promising. I see \"comoes\" and \"endes\". These may be verbs. The word before \"comos\" is \"c\" which may be \"it\", with \"w\" likely being \"i\" and \"🐶\" perhaps being 'l'.\n\nI will refine my guess based on these observations.\n\n```\n🐵=I, s=s, 🦆=r, 🤭=o, 🐨=m, 🤖=a, 🐶=l\n```\n\nAnswer: 👽=n,🐻=d,🦁=h,🤭=o,🤖=a,🐨=m,🐵=I,s=s,🦆=r,🐶=l\n","Okay, this is the last attempt, so I need to be very careful. Let's analyze the current state.\n\nThe encoded sentence is: 🐵. s. i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t i👽 t🦁e w🤖🐶 c🤭🐨es t🤭 🤖👽 e👽🐻.\n\nWe know:\n*   👽 = n\n*   🐻 = d\n*   🦁 = h\n*   🤭 = o\n*   🤖 = a\n*   🐨 = m\n\nSo the sentence becomes: 🐵. s. in🦆ol🦆ee🐨et in the wa🐶 comoes to an ed.\n\nBased on the history:\n\n*   I've tried:\n    *   🐵=I (Failed)\n    *   🦆=a (Failed)\n    *   🤭=i (Failed)\n    *   🐨=s (Failed)\n    *   🤖=o (Failed)\n    *   🤖=e (Failed)\n    *   🦆=f (Failed)\n    *   🤭=u (Failed)\n    *   🐨=r (Failed)\n    *   🐶=' ' (Failed)\n    *   🐵=H (Failed)\n    *   🤖=i (Failed)\n    *   🤭=t (Failed)\n    *   🐨=o (Failed)\n    *   🐶=s (Failed)\n    *   🤖=v (Failed)\n    *   🤭=y (Failed)\n    *   🐶=e (Failed)\n    *   🤭=s (Failed)\n    *   🐨=o (Failed)\n    *   🦆=f (Failed)\n    *   🐶=b (Failed)\n    *   s=t (Failed)\n    *   🦆=g (Failed)\n    *   🤖=a (Success)\n    *   🐶=s (Failed)\n    *   🐵=I (Failed)\n    *   s=i (Failed)\n    *   🐶=t (Failed)\n    *   s=s (Failed)\n    *   🦆=r (Failed)\n    *   🐶=l (Failed)\n\nConsidering the pattern, 's' might be 'i'. Let's assume 🐵 = I. 🦆 might be 'r'. 🐶 could be 'l'.\n\nLet's try this combination in the sentence: I. i. inrolreeet in the wal comes to an ed. Then 🦆 must be 'r' and 🐶 must be 'l'.\nThen the sentence could be: I. i. inrolemeet in the wal comes to an end.\nSo, let's finalize with:\n🐵 = I\ns = i\n🦆 = r\n🐶 = l\n\nAnswer: 👽=n,🐻=d,🦁=h,🤭=o,🤖=a,🐨=m,🐵=I,s=i,🦆=r,🐶=l\n"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Let's try to use context. The sentence looks like it is about astrophysics or some science. So maybe the sentence says something like \"galaxy together, the moons other...\".\nBased on this, I will guess the following:\n- 🐱=g (giving galaxy)\n- 🐭=m (giving moons)\n- 🥺=r (giving oroot, which could be orbit)\n- 🦆=f (giving tefeur, which could be feature)\n- g=a\n- i=b\n- n=d\n- s=s\n- x=i\n- r=p\n- 🤩=c\n- u=n\n- p=i\n\nAnswer: 🥴=e, 🐮=t, 🥳=h, 🐨=o, 🐯=l, 🐱=g, 🐭=m, 🥺=r, 🦆=f, g=a, i=b, n=d, s=s, x=i, r=p, 🤩=c, u=n, p=i","Let's analyze the encoded sentence and the history to make an informed guess.\n\nThe encoded sentence is: 🐱🐯🐮🐨g🥴🐮🥳🥴r, 🐮🥳🥴 🐭🐨ns🐮🥴🐯🐯🐱🐮i🐨n 🐭🐨n🐮🐱ins 🐱🥺🐨u🐮 50 g🐱🐯🐱xi🥴s 🐨🥺s🥴r🤩🐱🥺🐯🥴 🐮🥳r🐨ug🥳 🐱🦆🐱🐮🥴ur 🐮🥴🐯🥴s🐭🐨p🥴.\n\nWe know:\n- 🥴=e\n- 🐮=t\n- 🥳=h\n- 🐨=o\n- 🐯=l\n\nFrom History 1, we tried 🥴=e, 🐮=t, 🥳=h, 🐨=a but it turns out 🐨=o.\nFrom History 2, we tried 🥴=e, 🐮=t, 🥳=h, 🐨=o, 🐯=l and it was correct.\nFrom History 3, we tried 🥴=e, 🐮=t, 🥳=h, 🐨=o, 🐯=l, 🐱=h, 🐭=n, 🥺=p, 🦆=f.\nFrom History 4, we tried 🥴=e, 🐮=t, 🥳=h, 🐨=o, 🐯=l, 🐱=g, 🐭=m, 🥺=r, 🦆=f, g=a, i=b, n=d, s=s, x=i, r=p, 🤩=c, u=n, p=i. All turned out wrong.\n\nLet's try some common words\/patterns:\n\"the\" is a very common word, we already have \"the\".\n\"of\" is also a very common word.\n\nLooking at the sentence structure and using the known letters, let's focus on the shorter words first.\n* `🐮🥳🥴` is `the`.\n* `🐭🐨ns🐮🥴🐯🐯🐱🐮i🐨n` decodes to `monstelt?tin`\n* `🐱🥺🐨u🐮` decodes to `?potn`\n\nLet's try to deduce 🐱. Consider the substring `🐱🐯🐮🐨`. This would be `glto` with previous guesses.\n\nLet's try the common word \"and\". If we suppose 🐭=d then we have \"monsteltatin\". This doesn't really suggest anything.\n\nLet's re-examine the sentence: 🐱🐯🐮🐨g🥴🐮🥳🥴r, 🐮🥳🥴 🐭🐨ns🐮🥴🐯🐯🐱🐮i🐨n 🐭🐨n🐮🐱ins 🐱🥺🐨u🐮 50 g🐱🐯🐱xi🥴s 🐨🥺s🥴r🤩🐱🥺🐯🥴 🐮🥳r🐨ug🥳 🐱🦆🐱🐮🥴ur 🐮🥴🐯🥴s🐭🐨p🥴.\n\nWe have 'the' numerous times.\nLet's consider `🐱🥺🐨u🐮` which is `?po?t`.

I need to provide my best guess for the emoji-to-letter mapping based on the encoded sentence and the hint 🤓=a. Since this is the first attempt, I'll focus on the most frequent emojis and try to deduce their corresponding letters based on common word patterns and the provided hint.\n\nLet's analyze the encoded sentence:\n\n\"💩🥶e h🤓🤑f c💩🥶t😎🥶ue🐷 t💩 r🤓ce 🥶💩rthw🤓r🐷, 🤓ffect😎🥶g the ce🥶tr🤓🤑 u🥶😎te🐷 🙄t🤓te🙄 🤓🤑💩🥶g 😎t🙄 😍🤓th, 🤓🥶🐷 w🤓🙄 🤑🤓🙄t 🐷😎🙄t😎🥶gu😎🙄h🤓🤗🤑e 😎🥶 the e🤓🙄ter🥶 gre🤓t 🤑🤓ke🙄 reg😎💩🥶 💩🥶 🤓ugu🙄t 31.\"\n\nGiven 🤓 = a, let's look for patterns:\n\n*   \"🤓ffect\" could be \"affect\". This suggests 🤑=f.\n*   \"🤓t🤓te\" could be \"atate\" which seems like a variation of state. This suggests 🙄=s, t=t.\n*   The most frequently occurring emojis are 🥶 and 💩. The word \"a_ate\" further strengthens the hypothesis that 🙄=s.\n\nBased on this initial analysis, I'll make the following guesses:\n\n💩=o, 🥶=t, 🤓=a, 🤑=f, 🙄=s, 😎=i,🐷=e\nAnswer: 💩=o,🥶=t,🤓=a,🤑=f,🙄=s,😎=i,🐷=e\n","Okay, I understand the game. I need to provide a mapping of emojis to letters, including the given hint (🤓=a) and the correctly guessed emojis from the previous attempt (💩=o, 🙄=s, 😎=i). Let's analyze the encoded sentence and the feedback from the previous guess to make a more informed attempt.\n\nFrom the previous guess, we know:\n- 💩=o (Correct)\n- 🥶=t (Incorrect)\n- 🤓=a (Correct)\n- 🤑=f (Incorrect)\n- 🙄=s (Correct)\n- 😎=i (Correct)\n- 🐷=e (Incorrect)\n\nBased on the encoded sentence and the history, let's try to deduce some words. We have \"💩🥶e\" and \"t💩\". Since 💩=o, this gives us \"o🥶e\" and \"to\". Also we have \"🤓🤑f\".\n\nLet's re-evaluate 🥶. Given that \"💩🥶e\" is probably \"one\", then 🥶=n.\nLet's consider \"🐷\". It appears at the end of several words\/phrases: \"ue🐷\", \"rthw🤓r🐷\", \"te🐷\".\nConsidering \"🤓🤑f\", let's make a wild guess that 🤑 is \"l\", then we have \"alf\", which could indicate we are close to calendar related information. If we consider \"te🐷\" in this context, that could be \"tes\" or \"ter\", so \"🐷\" could be either \"r\" or \"s\", which makes sense if considering calendar dates.\nConsidering the final part \"...gre🤓t 🤑🤓ke🙄 reg💩🥶 💩🥶 🤓ugu🙄t 31\", that could indicate \"great lakes region august 31\".\nConsidering \"😍🤓th\", we know 🤓=a, so it could be \"date\". Therefore 😍=d.\nConsidering \"rthw🤓r🐷\", could be \"northwar-\" so 🐷=d, which contradicts to 🐷 being either \"r\" or \"s\",\nSo let's try 🐷=d. Then we have \"ue🐷\" as \"ued\". So 🥶 cannot be \"n\", if we assume that 🥶=t is \"true\" or \"the\" in the first sentence. So let's stick with 🥶=t and assume the first \"ue🐷\" is \"due\". That would make 🐷=e.\nThen we have \"rthw🤓re\", could be \"northware\", so 🥶 is not \"t\". So let's assume 🥶=n.\nSo let's try these: 🥶=n, 🐷=e, 😍=d, 🤑=r, 🤗=g.\n\nAnswer: 💩=o,🥶=n,🤓=a,🤑=r,🙄=s,😎=i,🐷=e,😍=d,🤗=g\n","Okay, I've reviewed the encoded sentence, the hint, and the history of guesses.

Looking at common words and the context, 🤗 could be 'b'. However, let's explore other possibilities first.\n* `t💩 r🤓ce`: We know `t` isn't `u`. It's likely `to race`. So r = c. That means 'race' is 'cace', so the second 'c' must be 'r'. r = r.\n* `h🤓🤑f`: This could be 'half'. Therefore, h = h, f = f.\n\nLet's reassess the encoded sentence with r=r, h=h, f=f.\n\n* `💩🥶e h🤓🤑f`: o n ? h a l f.

It's unlikely, so I will not assume this.\n* Given 'h🤑f', if 🤑=l, then it becomes 'half'.\n\nSince many emojis are still unknown and several previous guesses were wrong, I'll try focusing on the most frequent unknown emojis.
