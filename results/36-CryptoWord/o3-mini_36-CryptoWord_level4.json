The very first word is “🐨🐶ey.” Noticing that “ey” appears literally, it’s natural to think of “they” – so if we set 🐨 = t and 🐶 = h then “t h ey” spells “they.”\n\n2. The next word “🐶a😇” starts with 🐶 (h) then “a” and then an unknown emoji. With “they” as the subject it makes sense that “had” might follow. (“have” would normally be four letters.) So we set 😇 = d, making “h a d” = “had.”\n\n3. Then we have “🐶owe🐵e😍”. With 🐶 giving h and 😍 given as r, the structure becomes h, o, w, e, ? , e, r. This very nearly spells “however.” So we assign 🐵 = v.\n\n4. The word “bee💩” is next. With “bee” literally plus one emoji, it is natural to complete it as “been.” Thus 💩 = n.\n\n5. Next is a longer word “😍e😂💩fo😍ce😇”. Converting:\n  - 😍 = r,\n  - “e” is literal,\n  - so far “re”.\n  - Next, we see 😂. To form “reinforced” (a likely candidate here), we need an “i.” Thus assign 😂 = i.\n  - Then 💩 = n (as above).\n  - Then literal “fo”\n  - Then 😍 = r,\n  - Then literal “ce”\n  - Then 😇 = d.\nThis spells “reinforced.”\n\n6. The phrase “by a 😇e🐨ac🐶me💩🐨” will then be: 😇 = d, literal “e”, 🐨 = t, then “ac”, then 🐶 = h, “me”, then 💩 = n, then 🐨 = t. This spells “detachment.”\n\n7. Next, “of 32 g😍e💩a😇😂e😍🙄” becomes:\n  - “g”\n  - 😍 = r,\n  - literal “e”\n  - 💩 = n,\n  - literal “a”\n  - 😇 = d,\n  - 😂 = i,\n  - literal “e”\n  - 😍 = r,\n  - 🙄 (we assign later) becomes s.\nThus giving “grenadiers.”\n\n8. The next parts “f😍om” and “o💩e” clearly decode as “from” and “one” respectively.\n\n9. “of 🐨🐶e” then gives: 🐨 = t, 🐶 = h, plus literal “e” → “the.”\n\n10. Now “🙄w😂🙄🙄” decodes as: with 🙄 assigned as s (since we see s, then “w”, then 😂 = i, then s, then s) it is “swiss.” So assign 🙄 = s.\n\n11. Next, “me😍ce💩a😍y” gives:\n  - “me”\n  - 😍 = r,\n  - “ce”\n  - 💩 = n,\n  - “a”\n  - 😍 = r,\n  - “y”\nwhich spells “mercenary.”\n\n12. Then “😍eg😂me💩🐨🙄” decodes as:\n  - 😍 = r, then “eg”, then 😂 = i, then “me”, then 💩 = n, then 🐨 = t, then 🙄 = s,\nresulting in “regiments.”\n\n13. The following “🙄ummo💩e😇” reads: 🙄 = s, then “ummo”, then 💩 = n, then “e”, then 😇 = d, giving “summoned.”\n\n14. “🐨o” straightforwardly becomes “to” (🐨 = t plus “o”).\n\n15. Next “🤠a😍😂🙄” should become “paris” – assign 🤠 = p (so p, a, r, i, s).\n\n16. Then “by 🐨🐶e” again yields “the.”\n\n17. “🦊😂💩g” becomes: assign 🦊 = k (to get “king” since 😂 = i, 💩 = n, and literal “g”), which yields “king.”\n\n18. “🙄🐶o😍🐨ly” will read as: 🙄 = s, 🐶 = h, “o”, 😍 = r, 🐨 = t, “ly” → “shortly.”\n\n19. “befo😍e” becomes “before” (with 😍 = r).\n\n20. Finally “14 👻uly” decodes as “14 july.” To get “july” we set 👻 = j.\n\nThus, our assignments are:\n\n  🐨 = t  \n  🐶 = h  \n  😇 = d  \n  🐵 = v  \n  💩 = n  \n  😂 = i  \n  🙄 = s  \n  🤠 = p  \n  🦊 = k  \n  👻 = j  \n  😍 = r  \n\nAll told, my guess for this attempt (including the hint emoji and all previous ones) is:\n\nAnswer: 🐨=t,🐶=h,😇=d,🐵=v,💩=n,😂=i,🙄=s,🤠=p,🦊=k,👻=j,😍=r"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

We know from the hint that 🐨 = a.\n2. Looking at the second “word” “🐨ppe🐨🐶s” and noticing it should read as “appears” makes it clear that:\n  – 🐨 = a (given)\n  – The letters “ppe” are literal “ppe”\n  – The final emoji “🐶” must represent r so that “a ppe a r s” becomes “appears.”\n3. Then “🤔o” must decode as “to” so 🤔 = t.\n4. The word “c🐨se” easily becomes “case” when 🐨 = a.\n5. In “o👻” the natural word is “of” so 👻 = f.\n6. The word “expose🥺” should be “exposed” which gives 🥺 = d.\n7. In “me🤔🐨🐮🐮ic” we see:\n  – “me” literal\n  – 🤔 = t (from earlier)\n  – 🐨 = a\n  – Two occurrences of 🐮, and the letters following form “ic”. To spell “metallic” (matching context), 🐮 must equal l.\n  Thus “me t a l l ic” = “metallic.”\n8. Next, “co🐶e” becomes “co” + r + “e” = “core” (🐶 = r).\n9. “👻🐶om” becomes “f” + “r” + “om” = “from.”\n10. Then “🐮🐨🐶ge🐶” should decode as follows:\n  – 🐮 = l, 🐨 = a, 🐶 = r, followed by literal “ge” and then 🐶 = r gives “l a r ge r” which correctly forms “larger.”\n11. Next, “🥺i👻👻e🐶en🤔i🐨🤔e🥺” can be segmented into:\n  – “🥺i” = d + i\n  – “👻👻” = f f\n  – “e” literal e\n  – “🐶en” = r + en\n  – “🤔i” = t + i\n  – “🐨” = a\n  – “🤔e” = t + e\n  – “🥺” = d\n  Altogether: di + ff + e + ren + ti + a + te + d = “differentiated.”\n12. Finally, “p🐨🐶en🤔” becomes:\n  – p, then 🐨 = a, then 🐶 = r, “en” literal, and 🤔 = t results in “parent.”\n13. The last word “bo🥺y.” becomes “bo” + d + “y” = “body.”\n\nThus, the full decoded sentence is:\n  “psyche appears to be a genuine case of an exposed metallic core from a larger differentiated parent body.”\n\nBased on the deductions, here are the emoji assignments:\n\n• 🐨 = a  \n• 🐶 = r  \n• 🤔 = t  \n• 👻 = f  \n• 🥺 = d  \n• 🐮 = l\n\nAnswer: 🐨=a,🐶=r,🤔=t,👻=f,🥺=d,🐮=l"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

This fit with later words—for instance, “t💩” becomes “to.”\n\nLikewise, “h🤓🤑f” becomes h, a, ? , f. Seeing that “half” fits well here, I set 🤑 = l. Continuing in this way, I went through each encoded word. For example:\n• “r🤓ce” becomes r, a, c, e → “race.”\n• “🥶💩rthw🤓r🐷” becomes n, o, r, t, h, w, a, r, ? and fits “northward” if I let 🐷 = d.\n• “🤓effect😎🥶g” becomes a, f, f, e, c, t, i, n, g → “affecting” (here 😎 was determined to be i).\n• “ce🥶tr🤓🤑” gives c, e, n, t, r, a, l → “central.”\n• “u🥶😎te🐷” gives u, n, i, t, e, d → “united.”\n• “🙄t🤓te🙄” suggests s, t, a, t, e, s (“states”) if I take 🙄 = s.\n• “🤓🤑💩🥶g” gives a, l, o, n, g → “along.”\n• “😎t🙄” gives i, t, s → “its.”\n• “😍🤓th” fits to “path” if I assign 😍 = p (since p, a, t, h spells PATH).\n• “🤓🥶🐷” gives a, n, d → “and.”\n• “w🤓🙄” gives w, a, s → “was.”\n• “🤑🤓🙄t” gives l, a, s, t → “last.”\n• A longer string “🐷😎🙄t😎🥶gu😎🙄h🤓🤗🤑e” worked out as d, i, s, t, i, n, g, u, i, s, h, a, ? , l, e. Matching “distinguishable” required that 🤗 = b.\n• “😎🥶” → i, n (“in”)\n• “e🤓🙄ter🥶” → e, a, s, t, e, r, n → “eastern.”\n• “gre🤓t” → g, r, e, a, t → “great.”\n• “🤑🤓ke🙄” → l, a, k, e → “lake.”\n• “reg😎💩🥶” → r, e, g, i, o, n → “region.”\n• “💩🥶” → o, n (“on”)\n• “🤓ugu🙄t” → a, u, g, u, s, t → “august.”\n\nPutting it all together, the decoded sentence is:\n  “one half continued to race northward, affecting the central united states along its path, and was last distinguishable in the eastern great lake region on august 31.”\n\nBased on this, the emoji-to-letter substitutions I deduced are:\n  🤓 = a  \n  💩 = o  \n  🥶 = n  \n  🤑 = l  \n  😎 = i  \n  🐷 = d  \n  🙄 = s  \n  😍 = p  \n  🤗 = b\n\nBelow is my answer in the required format.\n\nAnswer: 🤓=a,💩=o,🥶=n,🤑=l,😎=i,🐷=d,🙄=s,😍=p,🤗=b"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

(Remember that every emoji must end up with a unique letter and the hint tells us that 🤩 is r.)

Only some letters are replaced by emoji.  \n• Splitting the sentence into “words” (using spaces and punctuation) gives us these tokens:\n  1. \"🐵.\"  \n  2. \"s.\"  \n  3. \"i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t\"  \n  4. \"i👽\"  \n  5. \"t🦁e\"  \n  6. \"w🤖🐶\"  \n  7. \"c🤭🐨es\"  \n  8. \"t🤭\"  \n  9. \"🤖👽\"  \n  10. \"e👽🐻.\"\n\n• The tokens “🐵.” and “s.” when read together suggest an English possessive. That is, “🐵” is meant to be read as a word that, with “'s” (encoded as “s.”), forms a phrase such as “Monkey’s …”\n\n• Then let’s look at token 3: \"i👽🦆🤭l🦆e🐨e👽t\". We already know 👽 = n, so replacing that we get the pattern:\n  i n  ?  ?  l  ?  e  ?  e  n  t\nSince the emoji 🦆 occurs twice in the same spots it likely represents the same letter. By the letter pattern, the full word is “involvement.” In that case we set:\n  🦆 = v\n  and deduce that token 3 becomes “involvement” when we set the unknowns as follows:\n  Position 3 (emoji 🦆) = v,  \n  Position 4 (emoji 🤭) = o,  \n  Position 8 (emoji 🐨) = m.\n\n• Look at token 4: \"i👽\" becomes “in” (because 👽 = n).\n\n• Token 5: \"t🦁e\" then almost certainly reads “the”. That leads us to assign:\n  🦁 = h.\n\n• Token 6: \"w🤖🐶\" looks to be “war” (since a war is common subject matter and later token 10, “end”, fits a phrase “… comes to an end”). We already know token 9 (after decoding) should become “an” (“🤖👽”). Thus for token 6, we set:\n  🤖 = a  \n  🐶 = r.\n\n• Token 7: \"c🤭🐨es\" becomes “comes” if we already have 🤭 = o and 🐨 = m (since “comes” = c o m es).\n\n• Token 8: \"t🤭\" becomes “to” (with 🤭 = o).\n\n• Token 9: \"🤖👽\" becomes “an” with 🤖 = a and 👽 = n.\n\n• Token 10: \"e👽🐻\" should be “end”. We already have e and 👽 = n, so we assign:\n  🐻 = d.\n\nThus the full decoded sentence is:\n  \"Monkey’s involvement in the war comes to an end.\"\n\nThis gives the following emoji→word (really, letter) mapping:\n  🐵 = monkey,\n  👽 = n,\n  🦆 = v,\n  🤭 = o,\n  🐨 = m,\n  🦁 = h,\n  🤖 = a,\n  🐶 = r,\n  🐻 = d.\n\nFor this round my guess is:\n\nAnswer: 🐵=monkey,👽=n,🦆=v,🤭=o,🐨=m,🦁=h,🤖=a,🐶=r,🐻=d","Based on the history and feedback from Attempt 1, nearly all our emoji‐to‐letter mappings were confirmed except for the one corresponding to 🐵.

In English the only one‐letter word that fits the form “_.” is “U.” and when followed by “S.” we get “U. S.”—as in “U.S. involvement in the war comes to an end.”\n\nThus our deduction is that the unknown emoji 🐵 stands for the letter U.\n\nIncluding all confirmed assignments, our complete emoji-to-letter mapping is:\n  🐵 = U, 👽 = n, 🦆 = v, 🤭 = o, 🐨 = m, 🦁 = h, 🤖 = a, 🐶 = r, 🐻 = d\n\nAnswer: 🐵=U,👽=n,🦆=v,🤭=o,🐨=m,🦁=h,🤖=a,🐶=r,🐻=d"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

In my reading the nine “words” come out as follows (with “literal” letters kept as shown):\n\n Word 1: f🐰🐶🤑 → f, then (🐰), (🐶), (🤑)\n Word 2: t🐭💩   → t, (🐭), (💩)\n Word 3: 🤗🐶🐰🤮 → (🤗), (🐶), (🐰), (🤮)\n Word 4: 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt → (😂), “cc”, (🐶), (🧐), “nt”, (😂), “nt”\n Word 5: t🐭💩   → t, (🐭), (💩)\n Word 6: t💩🐰🤑  → t, (💩), (🐰), (🤑)\n Word 7: 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nc🥵 → (😂), “cc”, (🐶), (🧐), “nt”, (😂), “nc”, (🥵)\n Word 8: 🙄🐵    → (🙄), (🐵)\n Word 9: 🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮 → (🤮), (💩), (🐰), (🙄), (🤥), (💩), (🤮)\n\nI noted the hint “💩 = e” and then observed a very suggestive pattern in word 4.","Based on the information provided, here is my first‐round guess. (Recall: the “hint” tells us that 💩 always represents “e”. Also, every emoji stands uniquely for one letter.) I find a natural reading if we interpret the nine “words” as follows:\n\n • f🐰🐶🤑 → “fool”  \n • t🐭💩 → “the”  \n • 🤗🐶🐰🤮 → “book”  \n • 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nt → “accountant”  \n • t🐭💩 → “the”  \n • t💩🐰🤑 → “teol”  \n • 😂cc🐶🧐nt😂nc🥵 → “accountancy”  \n • 🙄🐵 → “it”  \n • 🤮💩🐰🙄🤥💩🤮 → “keoirek”\n\nOne immediately sees the “accountant\/accountancy” “twin‐set” and the “book” in word 3; the very first word “fool” (a common four‐letter word) reinforces a play on words. (I must add that the “t💩🐰🤑” group (word 6) does not readily come out as a common word—in my guess it renders “teol” which might be intended to be “tool” if one were to tweak a letter; similarly the final word “keoirek” might be an encoding of a word such as “keyboard,” but these remain guesses.)\n\nMy guess is that the intended (punned) message is something like \n  “fool the book accountant the teol accountancy it keoirek”,\nwith the following emoji→letter mapping (using the hint that 💩=e):\n\n  💩 = e  \n  🐭 = h  \n  😂 = a  \n  🐶 = o  \n  🧐 = u  \n  🥵 = y  \n  🤗 = b  \n  🤮 = k  \n  🐰 = o  \n  🤑 = l  \n  🙄 = i  \n  🐵 = t  \n  🤥 = r  \n\nI offer this as my first complete guess for this round.\n\nAnswer: 💩=e,🐭=h,😂=a,🐶=o,🧐=u,🥵=y,🤗=b,🤮=k,🐰=o,🤑=l,🙄=i,🐵=t,🤥=r","Based on the encoded sentence and previous feedback, here is the reasoning:\n\n• We know from the history (and confirmed feedback) that:\n  💩 = e\n  🐭 = h\n  😂 = a\n  🐶 = o\n  🧐 = u\n  🥵 = y\n  🙄 = i\n\n• Looking at the encoded sentence:\n  Word1: f🐰🐶🤑  \n  – f is literal.

(Remember the published hint requires that the mouse emoji remains “s.”)\n\nFor example, when we see “telev🐹🐭🐹o🥵” and want to decode “television” we set:\n  •  🐭 = s        (as given)\n  •  🐹 = i        (since “telev i s i o…”)\n  •  🥵 = n        (i.e. “many” becomes m a n y and “...o n”)\n\nSimilarly, from “h🐹🐦hly” we note that to get “highly” we need the sequence H I G HLY so we take:\n  •  🐹 = i  (that fits with the television part)\n  •  🐦 = g\n\nNext, in “a🧐🧐ea😎ed” the natural reading is “appeared” so we choose:\n  •  🧐 = p\n  •  😎 = r\n    (since “appeared” = a p p e a r e d; the “ea” and “ed” parts come directly from the plaintext)\n\nThen “d😎ama🐭” should read “dramas” so with our assignments (😎 = r and 🐭 = s) it works.\n\nAlso, “o🤧” appears where we expect the word “of” so we assign:\n  •  🤧 = f\n\nAfter that “🧐lay” is read as “play” so that fits with 🧐 = p.\n\nFinally, the last fragment “clock🐹🥵🐦 o🤧🤧 a🥵d 🐭e🐰 t😎a🤧🤧🐭c.” can be parsed as a phrase like “clocking off and …” In that fragment the beginning “clock🐹🥵🐦” gives “clocking” (with 🐹 = i, 🥵 = n, 🐦 = g) and “o🤧🤧” becomes “off” (if 🤧 = f). Although the very last word is not completely clear, one way to “fill in the blank” is to assign values to the two as‐yet unused emoji as follows:\n  •  🦆 = d        (guessing from the context of a multi‐word title)\n  •  🐰 = t       (our guess for the one letter that appears near “t”)\n\nThus one complete guess for all emoji–letter connections in this round is:\n\n🐭 = s  \n🐹 = i  \n🐦 = g  \n🥵 = n  \n😎 = r  \n🤧 = f  \n🧐 = p  \n🦆 = d  \n🐰 = t\n\nI submit my guess as follows.\n\nAnswer: 🐭=s,🐹=i,🐦=g,🥵=n,😎=r,🤧=f,🧐=p,🦆=d,🐰=t","Based on the encoded sentence and the feedback from the first attempt, we already know that these emoji–letter associations are correct:\n\n•  🐭 = s  \n•  🐹 = i  \n•  🐦 = g  \n•  🥵 = n  \n•  😎 = r  \n•  🤧 = f  \n•  🧐 = p  \n\nIn the original guess the emoji 🦆 was assigned to “d” and 🐰 to “t,” and the feedback told us those were wrong.

To read “bafta” we need:\n  b, a, f, t, a.\nWe already have the literal “a”, 🤧 = f, and “ta” for “t” and “a.” Hence it makes sense to let \n  🦆 = b\n\nNow consider the final segment:\n\n  …; clock🐹🥵🐦 o🤧🤧 a🥵d 🐭e🐰 t😎a🤧🤧🐹c.\nReplacing our known emojis we get:\n  “clock” + (🐹,🥵,🐦) = “i”, “n”, “g” so “clocking”, then  \n  “o” + 🤧🤧 = “off” (since 🤧 = f),\n  “a” + 🥵 + “d” = “and” (🥵 = n),\n  then “🐭” gives “s”, the literal “e”, and then 🐰 is unknown, making “se?”,\n  and finally “t” + 😎 + “a” + 🤧🤧 + 🐹 + “c” = “traffic” (since t, r, a, f, f, i, c).\n\nThe phrase ends “… and se? traffic.” In plain English one expects something like “… and see traffic.” It fits nicely for a concluding phrase if we take 🐰 = e.\n\nThus for this second attempt we now propose:\n  🐭 = s  \n  🐹 = i  \n  🐦 = g  \n  🥵 = n  \n  😎 = r  \n  🤧 = f  \n  🧐 = p  \n  🦆 = b  \n  🐰 = e\n\nAll confirmed from Feedback (the first seven remain the same) and the two unknowns are now updated.\n\nAnswer: 🐭=s,🐹=i,🐦=g,🥵=n,😎=r,🤧=f,🧐=p,🦆=b,🐰=e","Based on the encoded sentence and the previous feedback, I’ve re‐examined each emoji’s mapping.

In the final part the series “Clocking Off” is explicit and the second title should be “Sex Traffic” – a BAFTA-winning drama.

(I note that the puzzle tells us that the “most‐frequent emoji” 😍 is “t” and that the same emoji always stands for the same letter. In the encoded sentence there are several “words” that appear twice so I expect the same emoji to yield the same letter every time.) \n\nMy guess is as follows:\n • 😍 appears in positions that make a word “t _ _ _”. In order for the four‐letter word “😍a🐼🐼” to be a valid English word – and noticing that the two occurrences of 🐼 are identical – “tall” is a good candidate. Thus I assign: 😍 = t and 🐼 = l.\n • Next, the eight‑character second word “🐸e😈ea😍e🐸” can be read as ______ if we let its first and last letter (🐸) be d (and so that word becomes “d e f e a t e d”). That suggests “defeated”. Thus I assign: 🐸 = d.\n • In that same word, the third character is 😈. In “defeated” the third letter is f so I assign: 😈 = f.\n • The third “word” is “a🐷”. With the literal “a” present this very likely stands for “an” so I assign: 🐷 = n.\n • The fourth word “sno🐶” then becomes “s n o _”. In Context “snow” is a common word; so I assign: 🐶 = w.\n • Later the tenth word “sub🐦i😍” appears. With 😍 = t this reads “sub _ i t” which perfectly fits “submit”. That lets me assign: 🐦 = m.\n • (The remaining words then fall into place. For example, “😍o” becomes “to” and “😈orce🐸” becomes “forced”, and the final word “😍a🐼🐼🐦ission” becomes “tallmission” which—when a space is imagined—would be “tall mission.”)\n\nSo the complete assignments for the round are:\n 😍 = t, 🐸 = d, 😈 = f, 🐷 = n, 🐶 = w, 🐦 = m, 🐼 = l\n\nI submit these as my guess for Attempt 1.\n\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐸=d,😈=f,🐷=n,🐶=w,🐦=m,🐼=l","Based on the rules, we must re‐assign new letters for the emojis that were marked “False” in Attempt 1 (namely, for 🐷 and 🐼) while keeping the ones already confirmed. In our first guess we had:\n\n  😍 = t  \n  🐸 = d  \n  😈 = f  \n  🐷 = n         (incorrect)  \n  🐶 = w  \n  🐦 = m  \n  🐼 = l         (incorrect)\n\nWithout a full decryption of the entire (partially literal) sentence it is hard to “read” the hidden phrase. However, a common strategy in these puzzles is to try a new pair for the two “False” mappings. For our second attempt we therefore keep the confirmed mappings and propose new guesses for the remaining ones. For example, one may choose:\n\n  🐷 = o  \n  🐼 = r\n\nThat is, reassigned the two unknown emoji so that our new mapping is\n\n  😍 = t, 🐸 = d, 😈 = f, 🐷 = o, 🐶 = w, 🐦 = m, 🐼 = r\n\n(There is no “correct” answer until more rounds narrow the solution down; this is our round‐2 guess following the feedback.)\n\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐸=d,😈=f,🐷=o,🐶=w,🐦=m,🐼=r","Based on the encoded sentence and previous feedback, here is my reasoning:\n\nWe know from the first two guesses (and the hint) that the following emoji‐letter assignments are confirmed:\n  😍 = t\n  🐸 = d\n  😈 = f\n  🐶 = w\n  🐦 = m\n\nLooking at the encoded sentence\n\n  \"😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission.\"\n\nwe can “decode” the parts we know. For example, the token \"🐸e😈ea😍e🐸\" becomes \n  d e f e a t e d\ni.e. \"defeated\". Also, \"sno🐶\" clearly turns into \"sno\" + w = \"snow\" and later \"sub🐦i😍\" becomes \"sub\" + m + i + t = \"submit\". Finally, \"🐶i😍h\" gives \"with\" and \"😍he\" yields \"the\".\n\nThis leaves us with two unknown mappings from the remaining emoji: \n  🐼 (which occurs twice in a row in words “😍a🐼🐼” and “😍a🐼🐼🐦ission”)\n  🐷 (which appears in the short token \"a🐷\")\n\nNote that both occurrences of 🐼 must yield the same letter, so the word “😍a🐼🐼” has the form: t a X X. A natural reading of the sentence is that it names a fighter – for example, the former ECW star Tazz. (Tazz is spelled T-A-Z-Z.) That fits perfectly if we let 🐼 = z. Then “😍a🐼🐼” decodes as “tazz” and “😍a🐼🐼🐦ission” yields “tazz” plus m followed by “ission” i.e. “tazzmission” (a playful portmanteau of “Tazz” and “submission”).\n\nThe remaining unknown is the single‐emoji word “a🐷”. For a two‐letter word following the article “a”, a common possibility in a name would be initials. “AJ” is a common set of initials in combat sports; so if we let 🐷 = j, then “a🐷” becomes “aj”. (Note that previous guesses for 🐷 were n and o, both marked false, so j is a new candidate.)\n\nWhen we apply these assignments the sentence decodes as:\n  \"Tazz defeated AJ Snow (5: 20) Tazz forced Snow to submit with the tazzmission.\"\nThis now reads like a match recap reporting that Tazz beat (or “forced”) an opponent named AJ Snow by submission.\n\nThus my complete mapping is:\n  😍 = t, 🐸 = d, 😈 = f, 🐶 = w, 🐦 = m, 🐼 = z, 🐷 = j\n\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐸=d,😈=f,🐶=w,🐦=m,🐼=z,🐷=j","Based on the encoded sentence and all previous feedback, we know these mappings so far:\n• 😍 = t       (from the hint)\n• 🐸 = d       (from all guesses, feedback “True”)\n• 😈 = f       (from all guesses, feedback “True”)\n• 🐶 = w       (from all guesses, feedback “True”)\n• 🐦 = m       (from all guesses, feedback “True”)\n• 🐼 changed over attempts; attempt 1 (l) and attempt 2 (r) were rejected, but attempt 3 with 🐼 = z was “True”\n• 🐷 has been tried as n (attempt 1), o (attempt 2), and j (attempt 3) with all receiving “False”\n\nSo the current confirmed mappings are:\n\n  😍 = t  \n  🐸 = d  \n  😈 = f  \n  🐼 = z  \n  🐶 = w  \n  🐦 = m  \n\nOnly 🐷 remains unsolved. It has not been n, o, or j. A very common single‐letter possibility that has not yet been attempted is s. (It’s not very common for an article “a” to be immediately followed by “n” as in “an” in this phrase because “n” has already been ruled out.) \n\nThus, for our fourth attempt we submit the guess for 🐷 as s. That would decode the sentence as follows:\n\n  \"😍a🐼🐼\"  \n    becomes “t” + “a” + “z” + “z” = “tazz”  \n  \"🐸e😈ea😍e🐸\"  \n    becomes “d” + “e” + “f” + “e” + “a” + “t” + “e” + “d” = “defeated”  \n  \"a🐷\"  \n    becomes “a” + “s” = “as”  \n  \"sno🐶\"  \n    becomes “sno” + “w” = “snow”  \n  \"(5: 20)\" is kept as is  \n  \"😍a🐼🐼\" again is “tazz”  \n  \"😈orce🐸\"  \n    becomes “f” + “orce” + “d” = “forced”  \n  \"sno🐶\" is “snow”  \n  \"😍o\" is “t” + “o” = “to”  \n  \"sub🐦i😍\" is “sub” + “m” + “i” + “t” = “submit”  \n  \"🐶i😍h\" is “w” + “i” + “t” + “h” = “with”  \n  \"😍he\" is “t” + “he” = “the”  \n  \"😍a🐼🐼🐦ission\" is “t” + “a” + “z” + “z” + “m” + “ission” = “tazzmission”\n\nSo the decoded sentence reads:\n  “Tazz defeated as snow (5: 20) Tazz forced snow to submit with the tazzmission.”\n\nWhile the phrasing is a bit odd, we do observe a recurring proper‑noun (Tazz) and “snow” is clearly shown by “sno🐶.” The only piece left in doubt is the single‐letter mapping for 🐷. Given the past tries, the new candidate “s” is logical.\n\nTherefore, my guess for round 4 is:\n  😍 = t, 🐸 = d, 😈 = f, 🐼 = z, 🐷 = s, 🐶 = w, 🐦 = m\n\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐸=d,😈=f,🐼=z,🐷=s,🐶=w,🐦=m","Based on the history and feedback the following emoji‐to‐letter assignments are now fixed:\n• 😍 = t   (also given as a hint)\n• 🐸 = d\n• 😈 = f\n• 🐼 = z   (as confirmed in attempt 3\/4)\n• 🐶 = w\n• 🐦 = m\n\nThe only remaining emoji is 🐷. Looking at the encoded sentence\n\n  \"😍a🐼🐼 🐸e😈ea😍e🐸 a🐷 sno🐶 (5: 20) 😍a🐼🐼 😈orce🐸 sno🐶 😍o sub🐦i😍 🐶i😍h 😍he 😍a🐼🐼🐦ission.\"\n\nwe substitute the known mappings to get:\n\n  \"t a z z  d e f e a t e d  a[?]  snow  (5: 20)  t a z z  f orce d  snow  t o  sub m i t  w i t h  t he  t a z z m ission.\"\n\nReading the words, we get:\n  \"Tazz defeated a🐷 snow (5:20) Tazz forced snow to submit with the tazzmission.\"\n\nNoting that “Al Snow” is a known wrestler, the word “a🐷” should decode to “al”. Since we already have the “a” literal, this forces the unknown emoji 🐷 to mean “l.”\n\nThus the complete mapping is:\n  😍 = t, 🐸 = d, 😈 = f, 🐼 = z, 🐷 = l, 🐶 = w, 🐦 = m\n\nSo my guess for this round is:\n\nAnswer: 😍=t,🐸=d,😈=f,🐼=z,🐷=l,🐶=w,🐦=m"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

(Remember that we already know from the hint that  \n  🥵 = e.) \n\nFor my first round I’m “playing” as if the encoded sentence were an English phrase (with six “words”) whose lengths are 9, 6, 8, 2, 6, and 5 letters respectively, ending with “1983.” Although many possibilities exist, here is one complete guess for the emoji‐to–letter mapping:\n\n  🥵 = e  (confirmed by the hint)  \n  🐹 = T  \n  😇 = h  \n  🐔 = r  \n  🥺 = o  \n  😴 = u  \n  🥶 = g  \n  🐵 = m  \n  🤑 = a  \n  👽 = n  \n  🧐 = i  \n  🦆 = c  \n  🐼 = s  \n  🤥 = w  \n  🤠 = y  \n\nThat is, my full first‐attempt “guess” is to read the encoded sentence as if every occurrence of the emoji is replaced as above. (I stress that without further clues the intended phrase remains ambiguous—but this is my first guess for the mapping.)\n\nAnswer: 🥵=e,🐹=T,😇=h,🐔=r,🥺=o,😴=u,🥶=g,🐵=m,🤑=a,👽=n,🧐=i,🦆=c,🐼=s,🤥=w,🤠=y","I'll give it a try with a revised mapping. In the previous attempt only the emoji 🥵=e was confirmed, so I’ll keep that fixed and propose new letters for the remaining emojis. (Note: This mapping is only my new guess based on shifting the previously submitted letters by one step in the alphabet; it may or may not decode the sentence to an intelligible phrase.)\n\nHere’s my guess for Round 2:\n\n  🥵 = e  \n  🐹 = u  \n  😇 = i  \n  🐔 = s     (Notice that since 🐔 appears twice in the first word, its letter is repeated.)  \n  🥺 = p  \n  😴 = v  \n  🥶 = h  \n  🐵 = n  \n  🤑 = b  \n  👽 = o  \n  🧐 = j  \n  🦆 = d  \n  🐼 = t  \n  🤥 = x  \n  🤠 = z  \n\nDecoding the sentence with this mapping yields:\n  Word 1 (9 emojis): 🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶 → u, i, s, s, e, p, v, e, h  \n  Word 2 (6 emojis): 🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔 → n, h, i, b, p, s  \n  Word 3 (8 emojis): 👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐 → o, u, e, h, i, n, e, j  \n  Word 4 (2 emojis): 🐵👽 → n, o  \n  Word 5 (6 emojis): 🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔 → d, o, h, t, e, s  \n  Word 6 (5 emojis): 🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠 → x, p, n, b, z  \n  Then “1983.”\n\nI realize the decoded words still aren’t obvious. Nonetheless, I must include the confirmed emoji (🥵) in my answer along with the others, as required.\n\nAnswer: 🥵=e,🐹=u,😇=i,🐔=s,🥺=p,😴=v,🥶=h,🐵=n,🤑=b,👽=o,🧐=j,🦆=d,🐼=t,🤥=x,🤠=z","","","Based on the clue (🥵 is “e”) and the feedback from previous attempts (only 🥵, 🐔 and 👽 turned out to be correct), one plausible – though by no means final – “mapping‐guess” is to keep the confirmed values and propose new letters for the remaining emojis so that, for example, the second word “🐵🥶😇🤑🥺🐔” comes out as “thanks” and the fourth word “🐵👽” becomes “to.” That is, we set\n\n  🥵 = e            [confirmed]  \n  🐔 = s            [confirmed]  \n  👽 = o            [confirmed]\n\nand then choose\n\n  🐵 = t  \n  🥶 = h  \n  😇 = a  \n  🤑 = n  \n  🥺 = k  \n\nso that word2 becomes t–h–a–n–k–s (“thanks”) and word4 becomes “to.”\n\nFor the remaining emojis we must “guess‐fill” a mapping. One possible complete guess is to assign\n\n  🐹 = p  \n  😴 = r  \n  🧐 = d  \n  🦆 = c  \n  🐼 = i  \n  🤥 = w  \n  🤠 = y\n\nso that the nine‐emoji first word (🐹😇🐔🐔🥵🥺😴🥵🥶) reads “p a s s e k r e h” (which might be interpreted as a “pass–…” word), while word3 (👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐) becomes “o p e h a t e d” (“opehated”), and word5 (🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔) becomes “c o h i e s” (“cohies”). (Word6 then comes out as “w k t n y”.)\n\nIt is not obvious that these “words” form an intelligible sentence, but the idea in this crypto word game is to use the confirmed hints plus the pattern “thanks … to … 1983” as a starting point for further rounds. (Much like many puzzles of this type, early rounds may produce a guess that is refined in subsequent attempts.)\n\nThus one acceptable answer this round is to propose the following tentative mapping:\n\n  🥵 = e,  \n  🐔 = s,  \n  👽 = o,  \n  🐵 = t,  \n  🥶 = h,  \n  😇 = a,  \n  🤑 = n,  \n  🥺 = k,  \n  🐹 = p,  \n  😴 = r,  \n  🧐 = d,  \n  🦆 = c,  \n  🐼 = i,  \n  🤥 = w,  \n  🤠 = y.\n\nEach guess is “on the table” until later feedback forces adjustments.

So set:  \n  🤑 = i.\n\nWord3 (👽🐹🥵🥶😇🐵🥵🧐) then decodes as:  \n  👽 = o, 🐹 = p, 🥵 = e, 🥶 = r, 😇 = a, 🐵 = t, 🥵 = e, 🧐 = d  \nThis spells “operated.”\n\nWord4 (🐵👽) is:  \n  🐵 = t, 👽 = o  → “to.”\n\nWord5 (🦆👽🥶🐼🥵🐔) now is:  \n  Letter-by-letter: 1st = 🦆 unknown, 2nd = 👽 = o, 3rd = 🥶 = r, 4th = 🐼 unknown, 5th = 🥵 = e, 6th = 🐔 = s.  \nWe need a six‐letter word meaning a destination that fits “_____” in “Passenger trains operated to _____ until 1983.” One possibility is “Forbes” (a town in New South Wales, Australia – note that many local passenger services ceased there in the early 1980s). “Forbes” is spelled F O R B E S. Thus we set:  \n  🦆 = f, and  \n  🐼 = b.\n\nWord6 (🤥🥺🐵🤑🤠) decodes as:  \n  🤥 = unknown, 🥺 = n, 🐵 = t, 🤑 = i, 🤠 = unknown.  \nA likely candidate is “until” (u n t i l) for which we require:  \n  🤥 = u, and  \n  🤠 = l.\n\nThus the full decryption becomes:  \n  Word1: passenger  \n  Word2: trains  \n  Word3: operated  \n  Word4: to  \n  Word5: forbes  \n  Word6: until  \nEnding with “1983.”\n\nSo our complete emoji-to-letter assignments are:\n  🥵 = e  \n  🐔 = s  \n  👽 = o  \n  😇 = a  \n  🐵 = t  \n  🐹 = p  \n  🧐 = d  \n  🥶 = r  \n  🥺 = n  \n  😴 = g  \n  🤑 = i  \n  🤥 = u  \n  🤠 = l  \n  🦆 = f  \n  🐼 = b\n\nThe decoded sentence reads:  \n  “passenger trains operated to forbes until 1983.”\n\nAnswer: 🥵=e,🐔=s,👽=o,😇=a,🐵=t,🐹=p,🧐=d,🥶=r,🥺=n,😴=g,🤑=i,🤥=u,🤠=l,🦆=f,🐼=b"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

For example, note that the encoded string begins with “🥺n” and later “🥺n👻🙄” and “👻🥶😂” appears several times. It “fits” naturally to assume that the very first word is “in” (so that we’d take \n\n  🥺 = i  and the provided literal “n” = n),\n\nand that “👻🥶😂” spells “the” – and indeed we’re given the crucial hint that\n\n  👻 = t, so to make “the” we must set\n\n  🥶 = h  and 😂 = e.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the short two‐letter words we have “🙄😱” and “😇nd” and “😇n”. It is reasonable that “🙄😱” is “of” (so assign\n\n  🙄 = o  and 😱 = f),\n\nand “😇nd” is “and” (so the “nd” remains literal and we then let\n\n  😇 = a).\n\nAlso, “🥺n👻🙄” then very neatly becomes “in” + “t” + “o” = “into.” \n\nLater parts of the sentence (for example “d😂🐰🥳🥺👻😂” becomes d-e-?-?-i-t-e, which – given that we already have 😂 = e, 🥺 = i, and 👻 = t – very likely is “despite” if we settle on\n\n  🐰 = s  and 🥳 = p).\n\nAnother confirmed bit occurs in “😇👻👻😂🐦🥳👻”. With our partial assignments (😇 = a, 👻 = t, 😂 = e, 🥳 = p) it turns into a-t-t-e-?-p-t; and to get “attempt” the only choice is that\n\n  🐦 = m.\n\n(There remains a handful of unknown emojis – for example 🤭, 🐭, 🤩, 🐱, 🐼, 🐻, 🐮, and 🧐 – but at this stage our answer must include both the hint and the guesses we are confident about.)\n\nThus my current “best‐guess” letter–emoji assignments are as follows:\n   👻 = t  🥺 = i  🥶 = h  😂 = e  😇 = a  🙄 = o  😱 = f  🐰 = s  🥳 = p  🐦 = m\n\nI now submit these as my guess for round 1.\n\nAnswer: 👻=t, 🥺=i, 🥶=h, 😂=e, 😇=a, 🙄=o, 😱=f, 🐰=s, 🥳=p, 🐦=m","Based on the progress so far, we know for sure from History that\n\n  👻 = t  \n  🥺 = i  \n  🥶 = h  \n  😂 = e  \n  😇 = a  \n  🙄 = o  \n  😱 = f  \n  🐰 = s  \n  🥳 = p  \n  🐦 = m\n\nand we already guessed that (from the “fall” in “in the fall of 2006”) the emoji 🐱 stands for “l” (so that “😱😇🐱🐱” becomes “f a l l”).\n\nFor the rest of the emojis the decoding is not uniquely forced yet. In this round I will offer a complete guess for every emoji so that each unique emoji is assigned a unique letter. (Later rounds and feedback can refine these assignments.) My current guess is as follows:\n\n  🤭 = r  \n  🐭 = d  \n  🐮 = g  \n  🐻 = c  \n  🤩 = v  \n  🧐 = n  \n  🐼 = u\n\nThus, my complete guess (including the ones from History) is:\n\n  👻 = t, 🥺 = i, 🥶 = h, 😂 = e, 😇 = a, 🙄 = o, 😱 = f, 🐰 = s, 🥳 = p, 🐦 = m, 🐱 = l, 🤭 = r, 🐭 = d, 🐮 = g, 🐻 = c, 🤩 = v, 🧐 = n, 🐼 = u\n\nAnswer: 👻=t,🥺=i,🥶=h,😂=e,😇=a,🙄=o,😱=f,🐰=s,🥳=p,🐦=m,🐱=l,🤭=r,🐭=d,🐮=g,🐻=c,🤩=v,🧐=n,🐼=u","Below is my work‐through and final guess.\n\n–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\nStep 1. From the “History” we know that the first‐round assignments (Attempt 1) were all correct:\n  • 👻 = t\n  • 🥺 = i\n  • 🥶 = h\n  • 😂 = e\n  • 😇 = a\n  • 🙄 = o\n  • 😱 = f\n  • 🐰 = s\n  • 🥳 = p\n  • 🐦 = m\n\nThen in Attempt 2 the guess added:\n  • 🐱 = l    [confirmed True]\n  • 🤭, 🐭, 🐮, 🐻, 🤩, 🧐, 🐼 – their guessed letters were rejected.\n\n–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\nStep 2. I examined the full encoded sentence\n\n  🥺n 👻🥶😂 😱😇🐱🐱 🙄😱 2006, 🤭😇🐭😂🐮gn🙄 😇nd 🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄 \n    🤩😂🐮😂 \n    🥺n🤭🙄🐮🥳🙄🐮😇👻😂d \n   n👻🙄 \n    👻🥶😂 \n    🐦🧐n🥺🤭🥺🥳😇🐱🥺👻🐼, d😂🐰🥳🥺👻😂 \n   😇n \n    😇👻👻😂🐦🥳👻 \n    🐻🐼 \n    🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄 \n    👻🙄 \n    🐮😂🐰🥺🐰👻 \n    👻🥶😂 \n    🥺n🤭🙄🐮🥳🙄🐮😇👻🥺🙄n \n   n 👻🥶😂 \n    🤭🙄🧐🐮👻🐰.\n\nI substituted every emoji whose value is known. (Notice some “chunks” like “gn” are left as literal letters.) From the context the plain‐text parts show a legal\/municipal merger announcement. In particular I read:\n  “In the fall of 2006, … and … … incorporated into the municipality, despite an attempt by … to resist the incorporation in the courts.”\n\nI deduced that the two proper–noun parts are names of communities.\nLooking closely at the first name (from the segment “🤭😇🐭😂🐮gn🙄”):\n  • Position by position, with our known letters:\n   1. 🤭 = unknown  \n   2. 😇 = a\n   3. 🐭 = unknown  \n   4. 😂 = e\n   5. 🐮 = unknown\n   6–7. the literal “gn”\n   8. 🙄 = o\n\nA likely reading is “CAPERINO” or “CAPERGNO.” Since the “😂” was given as “e” (and feedback confirmed it), I settle on “CAPERINO.”\n\nThen the next proper noun (from “🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄”) becomes:\n  1. 🐻 = unknown\n  2. 🥺 = i\n  3–4. literal “gn”\n  5. 😇 = a\n  6. 🐰 = s\n  7. 🤭 = (same unknown as above)\n  8. 🙄 = o\n\nThat spells “BIGNASCO” if we read the literal “gn” as the required “gn.” (Bignasco is an actual toponym in Ticino, Switzerland.) Given the context (“… incorporated into the municipality …”) it fits well.\n\nAnother “word‐chunk” is “🤩😂🐮😂” used right after that. When I substitute my known letters (with 🤩 still unknown and remembering that 🐮 appears later in “resist”) I can read:\n  1. 🤩 = unknown\n  2. 😂 = e\n  3. 🐮 = unknown\n  4. 😂 = e\nA natural word in the phrase “___ incorporated …” is “were” (i.e. “Cap… and Bignasco were incorporated…”). For “were” we need “w e r e.” So I assign:\n  • 🤩 = w  and (with 😂 = e already) we fix 🐮 = r. (This is consistent later in “resist”: 🐮😂🐰🥺🐰👻 → r e s i s t.)\n\nAnother later unknown shows up in “🐦🧐n🥺🤭🥺🥳😇🐱🥺👻🐼” which clearly decodes to “municipality.” (🐦 = m, then 🧐 must yield u, etc.) That lets me assign:\n  • 🧐 = u  and also since the ending needs a “y” I assign:\n  • 🐼 = y.\n\nNow one more unknown remains: in “🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄” (the Bignasco piece) we already used 🤭 in the same role as in the Caperino word. To be consistent the same emoji must represent the same letter. And finally, the very first unknown (🤭) we already used in the Caperino reading: To read “CAPERINO” we need that letter to be “c.” So assign:\n  • 🤭 = c.\n\nAlso the emoji 🐭 in “🤭😇🐭😂🐮gn🙄” must be “p” (to yield C-A-P…); so assign:\n  • 🐭 = p.\n\nOne remaining still is 🐻, which appears only in the second proper–noun word. To form “BIGNASCO” we need its first letter to be B. So assign:\n  • 🐻 = b.\n\n–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\nStep 3. Thus I arrive at the following complete mapping:\n\n  👻 = t\n  🥺 = i\n  🥶 = h\n  😂 = e\n  😇 = a\n  🙄 = o\n  😱 = f\n  🐰 = s\n  🥳 = p\n  🐦 = m\n  🐱 = l\n  🤭 = c\n  🐭 = p\n  🐮 = r\n  🤩 = w\n  🧐 = u\n  🐼 = y\n  🐻 = b\n\nAnd the decoded sentence reads as follows:\n\n  “In the fall of 2006, CAPERINO and BIGNASCO were incorporated into the municipality, despite an attempt by BIGNASCO to resist the incorporation in the courts.”\n\n–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\nStep 4. In the answer I now include my emoji=word assignments (including the confirmed hint and previously-correct ones) in the required format.\n\nAnswer: 👻=t,🥺=i,🥶=h,😂=e,😇=a,🙄=o,😱=f,🐰=s,🥳=p,🐦=m,🐱=l,🤭=c,🐭=p,🐮=r,🤩=w,🧐=u,🐼=y,🐻=b","Based on the history and the feedback, we now know that every emoji’s mapping from our previous (third) attempt stays correct except for one: the emoji for 🐭. (Recall that in Guess #3 we had assigned 🐭→p, but the feedback told us that mapping was incorrect.) Also note that every other emoji is fixed as follows:\n\n  • 👻 = t  \n  • 🥺 = i  \n  • 🥶 = h  \n  • 😂 = e  \n  • 😇 = a  \n  • 🙄 = o  \n  • 😱 = f  \n  • 🐰 = s  \n  • 🥳 = p  \n  • 🐦 = m  \n  • 🐱 = l  \n  • 🤭 = c  \n  • 🐮 = r  \n  • 🤩 = w  \n  • 🧐 = u  \n  • 🐼 = y  \n  • 🐻 = b  \n\nIn our encoded sentence the first “word‐group” after “2006,” is\n\n  🤭😇🐭😂🐮gn🙄\n\nwhich decodes letter‐by‐letter (with “gn” appearing literally) as\n\n  “🤭” → c  \n  “😇” → a  \n  “🐭” → ?    (still unknown)  \n  “😂” → e  \n  “🐮” → r  \n  then the literal letters “gn”  \n  “🙄” → o  \n  giving “ca ? e r g n o”\n\nA likely reading of this (in context with the later “bignasco”) is that it names one of two neighboring entities that were merged later on (“… and bignasco were incorporated into the municipality …”). Although other municipalities may be possible, on the basis of our previous trials the best next guess is to try assigning 🐭 the letter d. That would give\n\n  c a d e r g n o → “cadergno”\n\nwhich (although not yet “perfect”) is our best mapping for this round given the feedback history.\n\nThus, for our fourth attempt we propose the complete emoji→letter assignment as follows:\n\n  👻 = t,  \n  🥺 = i,  \n  🥶 = h,  \n  😂 = e,  \n  😇 = a,  \n  🙄 = o,  \n  😱 = f,  \n  🐰 = s,  \n  🥳 = p,  \n  🐦 = m,  \n  🐱 = l,  \n  🤭 = c,  \n  🐭 = d,  \n  🐮 = r,  \n  🤩 = w,  \n  🧐 = u,  \n  🐼 = y,  \n  🐻 = b.\n\nSince the rules ask that our guess be output as “emoji=word” (here the “word” in our mapping is the corresponding letter) separated by commas and with the final line starting “Answer: …”, here is our final answer:\n\nAnswer: 👻=t,🥺=i,🥶=h,😂=e,😇=a,🙄=o,😱=f,🐰=s,🥳=p,🐦=m,🐱=l,🤭=c,🐭=d,🐮=r,🤩=w,🧐=u,🐼=y,🐻=b","Based on the information from previous rounds—and the fact that the only emoji for which we haven’t yet locked in a letter is 🐭—we can “solve” the cipher as follows. (Remember that literal letters in the encoded sentence (like the “n” in “🥺n” or “gn” inside words) remain as themselves.) In our first guess (and the hint) we already had:\n\n  👻 = t  \n  🥺 = i  \n  🥶 = h  \n  😂 = e  \n  😇 = a  \n  🙄 = o  \n  😱 = f  \n  🐰 = s  \n  🥳 = p  \n  🐦 = m  \n\nThen in subsequent rounds the new emojis were introduced. By round 3 we confirmed that\n\n  🐱 = l  \n  🤭 = c  \n  🐮 = r  \n  🐻 = b  \n  🤩 = w  \n  🧐 = u  \n  🐼 = y\n\nOnly 🐭 remained unsettled. Noting that in the “🤭😇🐭😂🐮” sequence the letters coming out with our other mappings were c, a, (unknown), e, r and that “cancer” is a likely word fragment, it makes sense that 🐭 should be decoded as n.\n\nThus our final mapping is:\n  👻 = t  \n  🥺 = i  \n  🥶 = h  \n  😂 = e  \n  😇 = a  \n  🙄 = o  \n  😱 = f  \n  🐰 = s  \n  🥳 = p  \n  🐦 = m  \n  🐱 = l  \n  🤭 = c  \n  🐭 = n  \n  🐮 = r  \n  🐻 = b  \n  🤩 = w  \n  🧐 = u  \n  🐼 = y\n\nIn my answer—a full “guess” for this round—I include every emoji that has been given (the revealed hint 👻, as well as those we already correctly solved) plus my guess for 🐭.\n\nAnswer: 👻=t,🥺=i,🥶=h,😂=e,😇=a,🙄=o,😱=f,🐰=s,🥳=p,🐦=m,🐱=l,🤭=c,🐭=n,🐮=r,🐻=b,🤩=w,🧐=u,🐼=y","Based on the history and the feedback we received, we can be sure that the following emoji‐to‐letter assignments are correct:\n\n  👻 = t  \n  🥺 = i  \n  🥶 = h  \n  😂 = e  \n  😇 = a  \n  🙄 = o  \n  😱 = f  \n  🐰 = s  \n  🥳 = p  \n  🐦 = m  \n  🐱 = l  \n  🤭 = c  \n  🐮 = r  \n  🤩 = w  \n  🧐 = u  \n  🐼 = y  \n  🐻 = b  \n\nOnly one emoji remains unassigned. In every guess, the emoji 🐭 was given a candidate value but was always marked incorrect. Looking at the encoded sentence we see a “word”\n  “🤭😇🐭😂🐮gn🙄”\nwhich, interpreting our known mappings, becomes:\n  c a ? e r g n o\n\nA plausible reading is “cavergno” – a name that fits the pattern of a Swiss municipality (much like “bignasco”, which we decode from “🐻🥺gn😇🐰🤭🙄” as b,i,gn,a,s,c,o = “bignasco”). For “cavergno” the letters would be: C A V E R G N O. The only “missing” letter is the third one, which must be v. (Note that v is among the letters we have not yet used.) \n\nThus it is most reasonable to assign:\n  🐭 = v\n\nSo the final complete mapping is:\n\n  👻 = t,  \n  🥺 = i,  \n  🥶 = h,  \n  😂 = e,  \n  😇 = a,  \n  🙄 = o,  \n  😱 = f,  \n  🐰 = s,  \n  🥳 = p,  \n  🐦 = m,  \n  🐱 = l,  \n  🤭 = c,  \n  🐮 = r,  \n  🤩 = w,  \n  🧐 = u,  \n  🐼 = y,  \n  🐻 = b,  \n  🐭 = v\n\nThen the answer (using the required format) is:\n\nAnswer: 👻=t,🥺=i,🥶=h,😂=e,😇=a,🙄=o,😱=f,🐰=s,🥳=p,🐦=m,🐱=l,🤭=c,🐮=r,🤩=w,🧐=u,🐼=y,🐻=b,🐭=v"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

I’ll explain my reasoning briefly before giving my guess‐mapping.\n\nI know that every emoji stands for one unique letter and that the emoji which appears most often (🥵) is already fixed (🥵 = a). In this very first attempt I’m “playing” by assigning a tentative letter to each emoji as a hypothesis. (Later rounds and the recorded history will let us adjust the mapping as we learn which choices seem to lead to a readable sentence.) For now I’m guessing a mapping that might “work out” to form common words. For example, I’m reading the very first two–emoji group “🥵👽” as “am” (with 🥵 = a and then guessing 👽 = m). Then I propose that the next three–emoji group “👽🦊🤑” would come out as “mor” (so that together with “am” it might lead to a word like “amor” or “more”). Continuing in that spirit I assign letters that try to make pronounceable words. (Admittedly there is uncertainty and plenty of room for correction.) \n\nMy first guess mapping is as follows:\n\n  🥵 = a  \n  👽 = m  \n  🦊 = o  \n  🤑 = r  \n  🐰 = e  \n  🐵 = s  \n  🧐 = t  \n  🐶 = i  \n  🐸 = n  \n  😈 = g  \n  🦁 = c  \n  👻 = d  \n  🐱 = u  \n  🥶 = y  \n  🤫 = l  \n  🥳 = w  \n  🤓 = h  \n  🥺 = f  \n  😴 = b  \n  🤧 = p  \n  😇 = k  \n\nSo, reading the first few groups with this tentative assignment:\n– “🥵👽” becomes “a” “m” = “am”  \n– “👽🦊🤑” becomes “m” “o” “r” = “mor”  \n– “🐰🐵🤑🥵👽” becomes “e” “s” “r” “a” “m” = “esram”  \n… and so on.\n\nIt is not yet clear if the complete decoded sentence reads perfectly in English, but I’m ready to use the feedback from this (first) attempt to adjust the mapping in future rounds.\n\nAnswer: 🥵=a,👽=m,🦊=o,🤑=r,🐰=e,🐵=s,🧐=t,🐶=i,🐸=n,😈=g,🦁=c,👻=d,🐱=u,🥶=y,🤫=l,🥳=w,🤓=h,🥺=f,😴=b,🤧=p,😇=k","","I'll do my best with the clues you’ve given. Working step‐by‐step, I notice that:\n\n• We know for sure that the most frequent emoji is 🥵 and that its (hidden) letter is a. Also, from the previous round’s feedback only 🥵 (“a”) and 🐶 (“i”) were confirmed. \n\nOne natural “headline‐style” reading of the 16–word sentence is to see a pattern like\n  “[word1] [word2] [word3] [word4] [word5] [word6] [word7] 20, 2008, [word8] [word9] [word10] [word11] [word12] [word13] [word14] [word15] [word16].”\nMy first guesses ran along these lines:\n\n  Word1 (2 emoji “🥵👽”) → “at” (so I assign 🥵 = a and 👽 = t).\n  Word2 (3 emoji “👽🦊🤑”) → “the” (so with 👽 = t we would need 🦊 = h and 🤑 = e).\n  Word3 (5 emoji “🐰🐵🤑🥵👽”) → “great” (so I set 🐰 = g and 🐵 = r; then with 🤑 = e, 🥵 = a and 👽 = t we get g–r–e–a–t).\n  Word4 (8 emoji “🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈”) → “american” (assigning 🧐 = m, 🐶 = i, 🐸 = c, and 😈 = n; note that our already‐known “a” comes from 🥵).\n  Word5 (4 emoji “🦁🥵👻🦊”) was meant to be “game”","Based on the clues provided (the emoji corresponding to “a” and “i” having been confirmed on our first try) I’m going to make a fresh full‐mapping guess. In my new assignment the first four words decode as follows:\n\n • Word1 (🥵 👽): “a t” → “at”  \n • Word2 (👽 🦊 🤑): “t h e” → “the”  \n • Word3 (🐰 🐵 🤑 🥵 👽): “g r e a t” → “great”  \n • Word4 (🥵 🧐 🤑 🐵 🐶 🐸 🥵 😈): “a m e r i c a n” → “american”\n\nThat is, I set:\n  • 🥵 = a (confirmed)  \n  • 👽 = t  \n  • 🦊 = h  \n  • 🤑 = e  \n  • 🐰 = g  \n  • 🐵 = r  \n  • 🧐 = m  \n  • 🐶 = i (confirmed)  \n  • 🐸 = c  \n  • 😈 = n\n\nFor the remaining emojis (which appear later in the sentence) I must “guess” some letters in order to have a complete one‐to‐one mapping. My round‐2 guess is therefore as follows (note that the emojis already known as a and i keep their assignments):\n\n  • 🦁 = b  \n  • 👻 = o  \n  • 🐱 = d  \n  • 🥶 = y  \n  • 🤫 =","Based on the feedback, we now know that only two of the previous emoji–letter assignments were correct:\n• 🥵 = a (and it turns out to be the “hint” emoji because it is the most frequent)\n• 🐶 = i\n\nEvery other emoji from the first attempt must receive a new letter. (Also, note that when choosing new letters the letter we assign for a given emoji must not be the one we already tried; for example, since we tried “m” for 👽 and were told that was wrong, our new guess for 👽 must be something else.)\n\nOne valid guess we can offer is to reassign all emojis as follows:\n • 🥵 = a                   [Hint]\n • 👽 = n                   (we no longer use m)\n • 🦊 = e                   (not “o”)\n • 🤑 = t                   (not “r”)\n • 🐰 = h                   (not “e”)\n • 🐵 = o                   (not “s”)\n • 🧐 = r                   (not “t”)\n • 🐶 = i                   [Confirmed]\n • 🐸 = d                   (not “n”)\n • 😈 = y                   (not “g”)\n • 🦁 = u                   (not “c”)\n • 👻 = l                   (not “d”)\n • 🐱 = c                   (not “u”)\n • 🥶 = f                   (not “y”)\n • 🤫 = p                   (not “l”)\n • 🥳 = v                   (not “w”)\n • 🤓 = b                   (not “h”)\n • 🥺 = g                   (not “f”)\n • 😴 = k                   (not “b”)\n • 🤧 = m                   (not “p”)\n • 😇 = q                   (not “k”)\n\n(Each emoji is now mapped to a different letter, and none of the “new” assignments coincides with the rejected letter from attempt 1 for that emoji.)\n\nThus, my guess for this round is:\n\nAnswer: 🥵=a,👽=n,🦊=e,🤑=t,🐰=h,🐵=o,🧐=r,🐶=i,🐸=d,😈=y,🦁=u,👻=l,🐱=c,🥶=f,🤫=p,🥳=v,🤓=b,🥺=g,😴=k,🤧=m,😇=q","Based on the board and the previous feedback (only “🥵” and “🐶” having been confirmed as a and i, respectively) I’m going to change nearly every letter from the earlier tries. (Remember that the emoji shown as a hint—🥵—must remain “a”.) For this third attempt I propose a completely new mapping for all the emoji so that the already–confirmed “🥵=a” and “🐶=i” are preserved. Here is my complete guess (each emoji gets a unique letter):\n\n  🥵 = a  \n  👽 = t  \n  🦊 = h  \n  🤑 = e  \n  🐰 = g  \n  🐵 = r  \n  🧐 = m  \n  🐶 = i  \n  🐸 = c  \n  😈 = n  \n  🦁 = w  \n  👻 = s  \n  🐱 = o  \n  🥶 = d  \n  🤫 = u  \n  🥳 = s  \n  🤓 = k  \n  🥺 = d  \n  😴 = f  \n  🤧 = r  \n  😇 = p  \n\nIn the “crypto‐word game” each round the full encoded sentence is guessed by assigning every emoji a letter. In this attempt I make sure that the two already confirmed letters remain unchanged, and every emoji gets a new letter guess. (Keep in mind that some guessed words—once decoded according to my mapping—would read something like “at the great american wash on … Mc… defeated … nataska … welcome the … inaugu… champion” so that many parts are only nearly recognizable; we still have plenty of rounds to go.)\n\nAnswer: 🥵=a,👽=t,🦊=h,🤑=e,🐰=g,🐵=r,🧐=m,🐶=i,🐸=c,😈=n,🦁=w,👻=s,🐱=o,🥶=d,🤫=u,🥳=s,🤓=k,🥺=d,😴=f,🤧=r,😇=p","Based on the clues and corrections from previous attempts, here is the full breakdown of our mappings:\n\n• We already know from the hint and confirmed feedback that  \n  🥵 = a  \n  👽 = t  \n  🦊 = h  \n  🤑 = e  \n  🐰 = g  \n  🐵 = r  \n  🧐 = m  \n  🐶 = i  \n  🐸 = c  \n  😈 = n  \n  👻 = s  \n  🐱 = o\n\n• Then, to make “American Bash” work (a known WWE event) the fourth word “🥵🧐🤑🐵🐶🐸🥵😈” gives “american” and the following “🦁🥵👻🦊” must be “bash”. That forces  \n  🦁 = b  (so “b” + “a” + “s” + “h” = bash)\n\n• The next word “🐱😈” decodes “on” (o n).\n\n• The fourth word after that “🥶🤫🥳🤓” must give a month. To read “july” we assign  \n  🥶 = j, 🤫 = u (as confirmed), and we get “l” and “y” for the remaining two emojis, so set  \n  🥳 = l  and  🤓 = y\n\n• Then, the next literal part “20, 2008, ” is unchanged.\n\n• Next “🧐🐸🐸🐱🐱🥳” must read “mccool”. We already have  \n  🧐 = m, 🐸 = c, 🐱 = o, and with 🥳 = l it spells “mccool.”\n\n• The following “🥺🤑😴🤑🥵👽🤑🥺” becomes “defeated”. So we set  \n  🥺 = d, 😴 = f  (with 🤑, 🥵, 👽 already giving “e”, “a”, “t” respectively).\n\n• Next “😈🥵👽🥵🥳🤓🥵” must be the opponent’s name “natalya” (a known WWE diva). With our choices,  \n  😈 = n, 🥵 = a, 👽 = t, again 🥵 = a, then 🥳 already equals l, 🤓 now is y, and final 🥵 = a,  \n  so “natalya.”\n\n• Then “👽🐱” decodes “to” (t o).\n\n• The following word “🦁🤑🐸🐱🧐🤑” is “become”: with  \n  🦁 = b, 🤑 = e, 🐸 = c, 🐱 = o, 🧐 = m, 🤑 = e.\n\n• Next “👽🦊🤑” again gives “the” (t, h, e).\n\n• Then “🐶😈🥵🤫🐰🤫🐵🥵🥳” must be “inaugural”:  \n  🐶 = i, 😈 = n, 🥵 = a, 🤫 = u, 🐰 = g, 🤫 = u, 🐵 = r, 🥵 = a, 🥳 = l.\n\n• Next “🥺🐶🤧🥵👻” has to read “divas”. We already have “d” from 🥺, “i” from 🐶, “a” from 🥵, “s” from 👻; so we need “v” as the missing letter – assign  \n  🤧 = v.\n\n• Finally, “🐸🦊🥵🧐😇🐶🐱😈” clearly decodes as “champion”:  \n  🐸 = c, 🦊 = h, 🥵 = a, 🧐 = m, 😇 = p, 🐶 = i, 🐱 = o, 😈 = n.\n\nThus, the fully decoded sentence is:\n\n“at the great american bash on july 20, 2008, mccool defeated natalya to become the inaugural divas champion.”\n\nAnd the complete emoji-to-letter mapping is as follows:\n\nAnswer: 🥵=a,👽=t,🦊=h,🤑=e,🐰=g,🐵=r,🧐=m,🐶=i,🐸=c,😈=n,🦁=b,👻=s,🐱=o,🥶=j,🤫=u,🥳=l,🤓=y,🥺=d,😴=f,🤧=v,😇=p"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Since no additional mappings can be reliably determined yet, I will submit the confirmed mapping.\n\nAnswer: 🤖=e","Based on the visible hint (🤖=e) and noting that the first “word” is five emojis long, one idea is to try a common five‐letter number word whose fourth letter is e. For example, “three” fits if we let\n\n  🦆 = t  \n  👽 = h  \n  🐧 = r  \n  🤖 = e (as given)  \n  🐦 = e  \n\nThat way, the first encoded word “🦆👽🐧🤖🐦” becomes t‑h‑r‑e‑e, i.e. “three.”\n\nI will therefore submit the guess from this round including the hint emoji mapping and the new mappings for the first word:\n\nAnswer: 🦆=t,👽=h,🐧=r,🤖=e,🐦=e","Based on what we know – namely that one (and only one) emoji‐letter mapping is confirmed (🤖 must equal e) and that our previous attempt using “🦆=t, 👽=h, 🐧=r, 🤖=e, 🐦=e” failed (except for 🤖) – I must now offer in round 4 a complete guess (even though the “cryptogram” still holds many mysteries). One common “trick” in these puzzles is to start by “assigning” letters in order (except for the known letter) so that every emoji gets a unique letter. (It may or may not “spell” a clear sentence – later rounds or further feedback may let us adjust accordingly.)\n\nBelow is my round‐4 guess.\nI assign letters as follows:\n  🦆 = a\n  👽 = b\n  🐧 = c\n  🤖 = e                            [confirmed hint]\n  🐦 = d\n  🐶 = f\n  😍 = g\n  😇 = h\n  🐵 = i\n  😱 = j\n  🤠 = k\n  🐸 = l\n  🐱 = m\n  🤮 = n\n  🐔 = o\n  🤓 = p\n  🥵 = q\n  🐷 = r\n  🐨 = s\n  🦉 = t\n  🐻 = u\n  🦁 = v\n  🙄 = w\n\nI know this “alphabetical‐order” guess may be far from the real plain‐text message, but it does observe our one known mapping and gives every emoji a unique letter.

Here’s a summary of the work:\n\n• We start with the only given hint from every round: 🤖 = e.  \n• From attempt 4 we learned that 🤠 and 🤮 are correctly “k” and “n” when guessed as such, so we fix:\n   🤠 = k  and  🤮 = n.\n• From attempt 5 we got that 👽 = o, and also that 🦁 (which was guessed as q) and 🙄 (v) are correct.  \n• Then from attempt 6, several more emojis received confirmed letters:\n   😇 = r,  \n   🐵 = m,  \n   😱 = a,  \n   🐷 = b.\n• Later (working inside the parenthesis) the long string “😱🦆🦁🐶🐱🐦🐱🐸🐱👽🤮” was seen to spell “acquisition.” Recognizing that pattern meant:\n   😱 = a (already)  \n   🦆 must be c,  \n   🦁 = q (as already fixed),  \n   🐶 = u,  \n   🐱 = i,  \n   🐦 = s,  \n   and 🐸 = t.\n• Then the parenthetical “🐷🤖🦉👽😇🤖” became “before” (with 🐷 = b, 🤖 = e, 👽 = o, 😇 = r, 🤖 = e) so we deduced:\n   🦉 = f.\n• The very first word “🦆👽🐧🤖🐦” then becomes:  \n   🦆 = c, 👽 = o, 🐧 we assign = l, 🤖 = e, 🐦 = s,  \n so it reads “coles.”\n• Working on other words we found that  \n  “🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸🐦” becomes  \n   🐦 = s, 🐶 = u, 😍 = p, 🤖 = e, 😇 = r, 🐵 = m, 😱 = a, 😇 = r, 🤠 = k, 🤖 = e, 🐸 = t, 🐦 = s,  \n giving “supermarkets” (plural).  \n• Likewise “🐱🐦” is “is” (with 🐱 = i and 🐦 = s).  \n• “😱🤮” is “an” (since 😱 = a and 🤮 = n).  \n• “😱🐶🐦🐸😇😱🐧🐱😱🤮” then reads “australian” (using our known letters and 🐧 = l).  \n• The next word “🐦🐶😍🤖😇🐵😱😇🤠🤖🐸” (11 letters) is “supermarket”.  \n• The following “🦆🐔😱🐱🤮” becomes “chain.” That forces 🐔 = h.  \n• Then the word “👽🤓🤮🤖🥵” must become “owned” (it fits the context “... chain owned by …”). With 👽 = o, 🤮 = n, 🤖 = e we assign  \n  🤓 = w and 🥵 = d to yield o, w, n, e, d.\n• Then the next “🐷🐨” is “by” (so with 🐷 = b we deduce 🐨 = y).  \n• Finally the 10‐emoji word “🤓🤖🐦🦉😱😇🐵🤖😇🐦” translates as follows:  \n  🤓 = w, 🤖 = e, 🐦 = s, 🦉 = f, 😱 = a, 😇 = r, 🐵 = m, 🤖 = e, 😇 = r, 🐦 = s,  \nwhich spells “wesfarmers.”\n• The parenthetical portion then reads in full as:  \n  “(formerly coles group before its acquisition on 23 november 2007)”  \nwhich confirms all the mappings.\n\nThus, the full decoded sentence is:  \n  “coles supermarkets is an australian supermarket chain owned by wesfarmers (formerly coles group before its acquisition on 23 november 2007)”\n\nSo the final key for each emoji is:\n\n  🦆 = c  \n  👽 = o  \n  🐧 = l  \n  🤖 = e  \n  🐦 = s  \n  🐶 = u  \n  😍 = p  \n  😇 = r  \n  🐵 = m  \n  😱 = a  \n  🤠 = k  \n  🐸 = t  \n  🐱 = i  \n  🤮 = n  \n  🐔 = h  \n  🤓 = w  \n  🥵 = d  \n  🐷 = b  \n  🐨 = y  \n  🦉 = f  \n  🐻 = g  \n  🦁 = q  \n  🙄 = v\n\nTherefore, my guess for this round (including the already‐revealed 🤖=e) is exactly as follows:\n\nAnswer: 🦆=c,👽=o,🐧=l,🤖=e,🐦=s,🐶=u,😍=p,😇=r,🐵=m,😱=a,🤠=k,🐸=t,🐱=i,🤮=n,🐔=h,🤓=wa,🥵=d,🐷=b,🐨=y,🦉=f,🐻=g,🦁=q,🙄=v\n\n(For clarity, note that 🤓=w, not “wa”.)\n\nSo the final format is:\n\nAnswer: 🦆=c,👽=o,🐧=l,🤖=e,🐦=s,🐶=u,😍=p,😇=r,🐵=m,😱=a,🤠=k,🐸=t,🐱=i,🤮=n,🐔=h,🤓=w,🥵=d,🐷=b,🐨=y,🦉=f,🐻=g,🦁=q,🙄=v"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

(Remember that your answer must include the “hint emoji” mapping and any previous correct entries.)\n\nMy guess is:\n  🐱 = f,\n  🐯 = i,\n  🐮 = n,\n  🐨 = g,\n  🥴 = e,\n  🥳 = r,\n  🐭 = a,\n  🥺 = s,\n  🤩 = w,\n  🦆 = o\n\nSo, for this first attempt my answer is:\nAnswer: 🐱=f,🐯=i,🐮=n,🐨=g,🥴=e,🥳=r,🐭=a,🥺=s,🤩=w,🦆=o","","Based on the information so far (with the only confirmed mapping being 🥴 = e and none of the other assignments from Attempt 1 working), here is my new proposal for the round. (Keep in mind this is only one possible guess at a mapping consistent with our current clues; we have many rounds of tries.) \n\nI hereby submit the following new guess as my Attempt 2 mapping:\n\n  🐱 = t, 🐯 = h, 🐮 = c, 🐨 = d, 🥴 = e, 🥳 = u, 🐭 = m, 🥺 = o, 🤩 = p, 🦆 = y\n\nThat is, in my guess I assign:\n  • “t” to 🐱  \n  • “h” to 🐯  \n  • “c” to 🐮  \n  • “d” to 🐨  \n  • “e” to 🥴 (per the hint)  \n  • “u” to 🥳  \n  • “m” to 🐭  \n  • “o” to 🥺  \n  • “p” to 🤩  \n  • “y” to 🦆  \n\nI note that using these mappings, the encoded sentence \n\n  🐱🐯🐮🐨g🥴🐮🥳🥴r, 🐮🥳🥴 🐭🐨ns🐮🥴🐯🐯🐱🐮i🐨n 🐭🐨n🐮🐱ins 🐱🥺🐨u🐮 50 g🐱🐯🐱xi🥴s 🐨🥺s🥴r🤩🐱🥺🐯🥴 🐮🥳r🐨ug🥳 🐱🦆🐱🐮🥴ur 🐮🥴🐯🥴s🐭🐨p🥴.\n\nwould—for example, the first “word” would decode as:\n\n  🐱 = t,  \n  🐯 = h,  \n  🐮 = c,  \n  🐨 = d,  \n  then the literal letter “g”,  \n  🥴 = e,  \n  🐮 = c,  \n  🥳 = u,  \n  🥴 = e,  \n  then the literal letter “r”,  \n  yielding “thcdgecuer”. \n\nI recognize it is not obvious what phrase is meant yet; that is why we have several rounds of guesses. I include here every emoji (including the hint emoji 🥴 and those previously guessed) in my submission as required.\n\nAnswer: 🐱=t,🐯=h,🐮=c,🐨=d,🥴=e,🥳=u,🐭=m,🥺=o,🤩=p,🦆=y","I’m “playing” along and offering my third‐round guess. Based on the hint that the “squiggly” face (🥴) is e—and knowing that none of the emoji–letter assignments from attempts 1 and 2 were correct—I’m now trying a mapping that (I believe) will “unlock” the sentence. (Hint: My idea is that the hidden sentence may be built around a well‐known phrase—in my head I’m thinking of one with “50” in it.) \n\nSo here is my guess for every emoji’s letter:\n  🥴 = e  \n  🐱 = l  \n  🐯 = o  \n  🐮 = v  \n  🐨 = r  \n  🥳 = y  \n  🐭 = w  \n  🥺 = a  \n  🤩 = t  \n  🦆 = s\n\nThat is, I am proposing that when we “read” the encoded sentence with these assignments the ending “50 …” segment becomes “50 ways to …” and the whole thing may even be “50 ways to leave your lover.”\n\nI know it’s a risky guess, but I’m committing on round 3 as follows.\n\nAnswer: 🥴=e,🐱=l,🐯=o,🐮=v,🐨=r,🥳=y,🐭=w,🥺=a,🤩=t,🦆=s","Based on the available clues – with only 🥴 confirmed as “e” and all our earlier guesses for the remaining emojis being ruled out – I must now “gamble” on a new assignment that uses letters not yet tried for each emoji. (Recall that in our previous attempts every guess other than 🥴=e was marked wrong for that emoji.) \n\nI’ll propose the following mapping for this round:\n  • 🐱 = b  \n  • 🐯 = j  \n  • 🐮 = k  \n  • 🐨 = q  \n  • 🥴 = e  \n  • 🥳 = x  \n  • 🐭 = z  \n  • 🥺 = p  \n  • 🤩 = r  \n  • 🦆 = i\n\nThus my guess for this round, including the required hint and all emojis yet to be solved, is:\n\nAnswer: 🐱=b,🐯=j,🐮=k,🐨=q,🥴=e,🥳=x,🐭=z,🥺=p,🤩=r,🦆=i","Based on the information (with only 🥴=e confirmed so far) I’ll try a fresh mapping for all emojis.

(Keep in mind this is only our fifth attempt and we must include the confirmed mapping and our previous emoji letters; further rounds might refine these guesses.)\n\nAnswer: 🐱=c,🐯=o,🐮=d,🐨=i,🥴=e,🥳=f,🐭=y,🥺=t,🤩=h,🦆=s","Here is my guess for round 6.\n\nI’m proposing the following new assignments – keeping in mind that the only confirmed mapping from earlier is 🥴 = e and that none of the previous guesses worked for the other emojis. (All emojis that have been tried already must be re‐assigned to new letters.) My guess is:\n\n  🐱 = d  \n  🐯 = a  \n  🐮 = r  \n  🐨 = o  \n  🥴 = e  \n  🥳 = t  \n  🐭 = l  \n  🥺 = i  \n  🤩 = n  \n  🦆 = u  \n\nSo the full answer in the required format is:\n\nAnswer: 🐱=d,🐯=a,🐮=r,🐨=o,🥴=e,🥳=t,🐭=l,🥺=i,🤩=n,🦆=u","Based on the encoded sentence and the feedback from previous attempts, here is how I deduced the mappings:\n\n1. We know from the hint that  \n  🥴 = e  \n2. In attempt 6 the answer “🐨=o” was confirmed.\n3. Looking at the first word “🐱🐯🐮🐨g🥴🐮🥳🥴r” we see, after substituting, it becomes “?_?_?_o g e _ ? e r”. This looks like “altogether.” In “altogether” the letters are “a l t o g e t h e r.” That lets us set:\n  🐱 = a  \n  🐯 = l  \n  🐮 = t  \n  🥳 = h  \n4. Next, the second word “🐮🥳🥴” with our assignments becomes “t h e” which is “the.”\n5. The third word “🐭🐨ns🐮🥴🐯🐯🐱🐮i🐨n” (noticing that “ns” and “i n” are given literally) then substitutes to “?_o n s t e ? ? ? t i o n”. A fitting 13‐letter word is “constellation”. For that to work we assign:\n  🐭 = c  \n  and since the two occurrences of 🐯 must be identical, they both become “l” so that the word spells “constellation.”\n  Also, the literal letters and our previously determined ones line up.\n6. The fourth word “🐭🐨n🐮🐱ins” becomes “c o n t a ins” which clearly reads “contains.”\n7. The fifth word “🐱🥺🐨u🐮” becomes “a ? o u t”. This is “about” so we let:\n  🥺 = b\n8. The sixth word “50 g🐱🐯🐱xi🥴s” becomes “50 g a l a xi e s”. Reading “galaxies” (with “xi” standing in for the “xi” sound) fits the context.\n9. The seventh word “🐨🥺s🥴r🤩🐱🥺🐯🥴” becomes “o b s e r ? a b l e”. That clearly spells “observable” if:\n  🤩 = v\n10. The eighth word “🐮🥳r🐨ug🥳” becomes “t h r o ug h” which is “through.”\n11. The ninth word “🐱🦆🐱🐮🥴ur” becomes “a ? a t e ur”. This best fits “amateur” if:  \n  🦆 = m\n12. The tenth word “🐮🥴🐯🥴s🐭🐨p🥴” becomes “t e l e s c o p e” which is “telescope.”\n\nSumming up the assignments we have:\n  🐱 = a  \n  🐯 = l  \n  🐮 = t  \n  🐨 = o  \n  🥴 = e  \n  🥳 = h  \n  🐭 = c  \n  🥺 = b  \n  🤩 = v  \n  🦆 = m  \n\nThus, the complete decoded sentence reads:\n  “altogether the constellation contains about 50 galaxies observable through amateur telescope.”\n\nAnswer: 🐱=a,🐯=l,🐮=t,🐨=o,🥴=e,🥳=h,🐭=c,🥺=b,🤩=v,🦆=m"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
