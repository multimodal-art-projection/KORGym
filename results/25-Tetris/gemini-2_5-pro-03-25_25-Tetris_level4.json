The surface remains relatively flat.\n\nLet's consider other options briefly:\n- Rotation 0°\/180°: This shape (width 3) is wider and would create holes or land awkwardly on the existing structure. For instance, dropping at column 1 would land high and leave a hole underneath. Dropping further right would create holes above the bottom row.\n- Rotation 90°\/270° at other columns: Dropping at column 1 or 2 would land very high. Dropping further right (column 4+) would create holes.\n\nTherefore, placing the block rotated 90° at column 3 seems optimal.\n\nAnswer: 3 90"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

If an entire row becomes fully occupied, it will automatically be cleared, increasing the score by 1.The block will continue to fall until it is obstructed by another block or reaches the bottom of the board.\n\n- On the board:\n  - '*' represents a square occupied by a block.\n  - '.' represents an empty square.\n\n- The current block information includes its shape and rotation state:\n  - '*' represents squares occupied by the current block.\n  - '0' represents empty spaces.\n\nYou must provide your action in the format:  \n'Answer: [drop_coordinate] [rotation_angle]' ,e.g. 'Answer: 4 90'.\nwhere:\n- '[drop_coordinate]' refers to the leftmost square of the block relative to the board, ranging from 1 (leftmost) to 10 (rightmost).\n- '[rotation_angle]' represents the rotation applied to the current falling block, provided explicitly in the game information, where '*' denotes block squares and '0' denotes empty spaces.\nFor example, if the board is:\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n......**..\n**..****..\n**...**...\nand the Current Block is:  \n0°:\n0**\n**0\n90°:\n*0\n**\n0*\n180°:\n0**\n**0\n270°:\n*0\n**\n0*\nIf the provided action is 'Answer: 3 90', the leftmost square of the block rotated by 90° will land in the third column of the board, and the board will become:\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..*...**..\n********..\n**.*.**...\n\nThe current game board is:\nEpoch: 6\nScore: 0\nBoard:\n..........\n..........\n...**.....\n..**......\n..*.......\n..*.......\n..*.......\n..*.....**\n.**......*\n**.......*\nCurrent Block (rotations):\n0°:\n**0\n0**\n90°:\n0*\n**\n*0\n180°:\n**0\n0**\n270°:\n0*\n**\n*0\n\n\n","action":"3 90","width":10,"height":10,"response":["Okay, let's analyze the situation.\nThe board is empty (10x10).\nThe current block is an S\/Z shape.\nRotations:\n0°\/180°:\n 0**\n **0\n (Width 3, Height 2)\n Occupied relative cells (row, col from top-left): (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1)\n\n90°\/270°:\n *0\n **\n 0*\n (Width 2, Height 3)\n Occupied relative cells (row, col from top-left): (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1)\n\nThe goal is to place the first block optimally. Generally, this means placing it low, flat, and preferably towards the sides to leave space in the middle.\n\nOption 1: Use 0° rotation.\n- The block is 3 wide and 2 high.\n- If placed on the bottom, it will occupy rows 9 and 10.\n- To place it on the far left, its bounding box (which spans 3 columns) should start at column 1. This means the block occupies columns 1, 2, and 3.\n- According to the definition \"[drop_coordinate]' refers to the leftmost square of the block relative to the board\", and interpreting this as the leftmost column the block occupies, the drop coordinate would be 1.\n- Let's verify the resulting shape placement using the relative coordinates and assuming drop coordinate 1 means the top-left of the bounding box starts at column 1, and it lands with the top of the bounding box at row 9 (since row 10 is the bottom):\n  - Origin (top-left of bounding box) at (Row 9, Col 1).\n  - Cell (0,1) -> Board (9, 1+1) = (9, 2) -> '*'\n  - Cell (0,2) -> Board (9, 1+2) = (9, 3) -> '*'\n  - Cell (1,0) -> Board (9+1, 1+0) = (10, 1) -> '*'\n  - Cell (1,1) -> Board (9+1, 1+1) = (10, 2) -> '*'\n  Resulting board:\n  ..........\n  ..........\n  ..........\n  ..........\n  ..........\n  ..........\n  ..........\n  ..........\n  .**....... (Row 9)\n  **........ (Row 10)\n- This placement is low and flat, leaving a clear area above. It seems like a good starting move.\n\nOption 2: Use 90° rotation.\n- The block is 2 wide and 3 high.\n- If placed on the bottom, it will occupy rows 8, 9, and 10.\n- To place it on the far left, its bounding box (which spans 2 columns) should start at column 1. The block occupies columns 1 and 2. Drop coordinate is 1.\n- Let's verify the resulting shape placement:\n  - Origin (top-left of bounding box) at (Row 8, Col 1).\n  - Cell (0,0) -> Board (8, 1+0) = (8, 1) -> '*'\n  - Cell (1,0) -> Board (8+1, 1+0) = (9, 1) -> '*'\n  - Cell (1,1) -> Board (8+1, 1+1) = (9, 2) -> '*'\n  - Cell (2,1) -> Board (8+2, 1+1) = (10, 2) -> '*'\n  Resulting board:\n  ..........\n  ..........\n  ..........\n  ..........\n  ..........\n  ..........\n  ..........\n  ..........\n  *......... (Row 8)\n  **........ (Row 9)\n  .*........ (Row 10)\n- This placement creates a taller structure and some overhangs\/holes immediately, which is generally less desirable than the flatter 0° placement.\n\nConclusion: The 0° rotation placed at the left edge seems best.\n\nAction:\n- Drop Coordinate: 1\n- Rotation Angle: 0\n\nAnswer: 1 0","```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_occupied_squares(block_shape, rotation, top_left_coord):\n    \"\"\"Gets the board coordinates occupied by a block.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = block_shape[rotation].shape\n    coords = set()\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if block_shape[rotation][r, c] == '*':\n                coords.add((top_left_coord[0] + r, top_left_coord[1] + c))\n    return coords\n\ndef parse_board(board_str):\n    \"\"\"Parses the board string into a numpy array.\"\"\"\n    lines = board_str.strip().split('\\n')\n    rows = len(lines)\n    cols = len(lines[0])\n    board = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=int)\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if lines[r][c] == '*':\n                board[r, c] = 1\n    return board\n\ndef parse_block_rotations(block_str):\n    \"\"\"Parses the block rotation string into a dictionary of numpy arrays.\"\"\"\n    rotations = {}\n    parts = block_str.strip().split('\\n\\n')\n    for part in parts:\n        lines = part.split('\\n')\n        angle = int(lines[0].replace('°:', ''))\n        shape_lines = lines[1:]\n        rows = len(shape_lines)\n        cols = len(shape_lines[0])\n        shape = np.full((rows, cols), ' ') # Use space for easier parsing\n        for r in range(rows):\n            for c in range(cols):\n                shape[r, c] = shape_lines[r][c]\n        rotations[angle] = (shape == '*') # Convert to boolean array where '*' is True\n    return rotations\n\n\ndef get_block_dimensions(block_array):\n    \"\"\"Gets the height and width of the block shape.\"\"\"\n    if block_array.size == 0:\n        return 0, 0\n    rows, cols = np.where(block_array)\n    if not rows.size: # Handle empty block representation if necessary\n        return 0, 0\n    height = rows.max() -

Analyze the Board and Block:**\n- **Board:**\n  ```\n  ..........\n  ..........\n  ...**.....\n  ..**......\n  ..*.......\n  ..*.......\n  ..*.......\n  ..*.....**\n  .**......*\n  **.......*\n  ```\n  The board has a significant structure on the left side, particularly a deep well or gap in columns 1 and 2, and a structure in columns 3 and 4 reaching up to row 2. The right side is lower.\n- **Current Block:** It's an L-shaped block (specifically, an inverted L).\n  - 0°: `00*`, `***`\n  - 90°: `*0`, `*0`, `**`\n  - 180°: `***`, `*00`\n  - 270°: `**`, `0*`, `0*`\n\n**2. Evaluate Potential Moves:**\nMy goal is to place the block to keep the stack low, avoid creating holes, and potentially clear lines (though none seem immediately possible).\n\n- **Rotation 0° (00*, ***):** Placing this generally creates overhangs or lands high on the right side. For example, placing it at column 5 lands relatively flatly but high (bottom at row 7). Placing it at column 4 creates a hole.\n- **Rotation 90° (*0, *0, **):** This vertical shape seems promising for filling gaps.\n    - Placing at column 1 (leftmost square at col 1): It drops down to row 5, fitting into the gap next to the leftmost structure. Max height becomes 5. Board:\n      ```\n      ..........\n      ..........\n      ...**.....\n      ..**......\n      ..*.......\n      .*........ (new)\n      .*........ (new)\n      .**.....** (new)\n      .**......*\n      **.......*\n      ```\n    - Placing at column 3 (leftmost square at col 3): It slots *perfectly* into the structure at columns 3 and 4, landing with its bottom at row 2. Max height becomes 0. Board:\n      ```\n      ..*....... (new)\n      ..*....... (new)\n      ..**...... (new)\n      ..**......\n      ..*.......\n      ..*.......\n      ..*.......\n      ..*.....**\n      .**......*\n      **.......*\n      ```\n      This is an excellent fit, lowering the maximum height significantly and creating a flat surface.\n- **Rotation 180° (***, *00):** This shape tends to create overhangs or holes in the current board configuration. For example, placing at column 4 lands on row 6, creating holes.\n- **Rotation 270° (**, 0*, 0*):**\n    - Placing at column 2: It drops down to row 5, filling a gap. Max height becomes 5. Similar outcome to 90° at column 1. Board:\n      ```\n      ..........\n      ..........\n      ...**.....\n      ..**......\n      ..*.......\n      ..**...... (new)\n      .. *...... (new)\n      .. *....** (new)\n      .**......*\n      **.......*\n      ```\n\n**3. Select the Best Move:**\nComparing the best options:\n- 90° at Col 3: Lands lowest (max height 0), creates the flattest surface, perfect fit.\n- 90° at Col 1: Lands higher (max height 5), good fit.\n- 270° at Col 2: Lands higher (max height 5), good fit.\n\nThe placement with 90° rotation at column 3 is clearly the superior move. It utilizes the existing structure perfectly and significantly lowers the overall height of the stack.\n\n**4.

Placing it next to the stack (e.g., column 3) leaves holes or gaps.\n*   **Rotation 180° (`***` \/ `00*`):**\n    *   Placing at column 1 (`Answer: 1 180`) fits perfectly next to the existing structure. The block (`***` \/ `00*`) lands with its top row (`***`) on board row 7.\n    ```\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ***.......\n    ..*.......\n    **........\n    **........\n    ```\n    This fills the space cleanly, leaves a relatively flat surface, and keeps the maximum height contained.\n*   **Rotation 270° (`0*` \/ `0*` \/ `**`):**\n    *   Placing at column 1 (`Answer: 1 270`) lands high (bottom `**` on row 7) and creates a tall structure early on.\n    ```\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    .*........\n    .*........\n    **........\n    **........\n    **........\n    ```\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe best move is to use the 180° rotation and drop it at column 1. This fits neatly against the existing blocks without creating holes and maintains a relatively low and flat stack.\n\nAnswer: 1 180","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to find the optimal move.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Board:**\n    - The current stack is highest on the left three columns, reaching row 7 (index 7).\n    - There's a 1-column wide gap in column 3 (index 2) down to row 7.\n    - The board state is relatively low.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Block:**\n    - The block is an I-shape (straight line of 4 squares).\n    - Rotations 0° and 180° result in a 1x4 horizontal line (****).\n    - Rotations 90° and 270° result in a 4x1 vertical line (* vertically).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Potential Moves:**\n    *   **Horizontal Placement (0° or 180°):**\n        *   Placing `****` horizontally would either land on the bottom row (columns 1-3) creating a gap above it, or land higher up (columns 4 onwards) creating significant gaps underneath. For example, placing at column 1 (1 0) would result in `****......` on row 10, leaving a hole at (row 8, column 3). Placing at column 4 (4 0) would land on row 7, creating large holes below. This orientation seems suboptimal.\n    *   **Vertical Placement (90° or 270°):**\n        *   Placing the vertical `*` block is ideal for filling narrow gaps.\n        *   Dropping the block in column 3 (index 2) fits perfectly into the existing gap. The block will fall until its lowest square rests on row 7 (index 6), stopped by the '*' block at (row 7, column 2). The block will occupy cells (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), and (3,7).\n        *   This move fills the deepest valley completely, creating a flatter surface for subsequent blocks, which is generally a good strategy. Although it increases the maximum height to row 4, it avoids creating immediate holes.\n        *   Placing the vertical block in other columns (e.g., 1, 2, or 4+) would either not fill the main gap or create new unevenness.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    - The best move is to rotate the block vertically (90° or 270°) and drop it into column 3.\n\n5.  **Format the Answer:**\n    - Drop coordinate: 3 (as this is the leftmost, and only, column the vertical block occupies)\n    - Rotation angle: 90° (270° would yield the same result)\n\nAnswer: 3 90","Okay, I will analyze the board state and the current block to find the optimal placement.\n\n**Board Analysis:**\nThe board has a structure primarily on the left side.\n- A tall pillar in column 3, reaching row 6.\n- Wider structures at the bottom (rows 0, 1, 2).\n- The goal is to place the S-block to potentially clear lines or set up future clears, while minimizing holes and height.\n\n**Block Analysis:**\nThe current block is an 'S' shape.\n- 0°\/180° rotation: `**0`, `0**` (3 wide, 2 high)\n- 90°\/270° rotation: `0*`, `**`, `*0` (2 wide, 3 high)\n\n**Evaluating Placements:**\n\n1.  **Rotation 0°\/180° (`**0`, `0**`)**:\n    - Placing this low down (e.g., Col 1, Col 2) tends to create holes or overhangs because of the existing structure at the bottom.\n    - Placing it higher (e.g., Col 1) results in the block landing high up (bottom at row 7), creating an overhang. Board: `* **......` (8), `.**.*.....` (7).\n\n2.  **Rotation 90°\/270° (`0*`, `**`, `*0`)**:\n    - This rotation is 2 wide and 3 high. It fits better vertically.\n    - **Column 3:**\n        - The block shape is `.`* (col 4), `**` (col 3, 4), `*`. (col 3). Leftmost column is 3.\n        - It will fall until the lowest '*' in column 3 hits the existing '*' at row 6.\n        - The block's lowest point (`* .` at relative 0,0) lands at absolute coordinates (Column 3, Row 7).\n        - The block occupies squares: (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9).\n        - Resulting board:\n          `...*......` (9)\n          `..**......` (8)\n          `..**......` (7)  <- Block lands on existing '*' at (3,7) ? No, board is empty at (3,7). Original board has '*' at (3,6). Landing at (3,7) is correct.\n          `..*.......` (6)\n          `..*.......` (5)\n          `..*.......` (4)\n          `..*.......` (3)\n          `***.......` (2)\n          `***.......` (1)\n          `**........` (0)\n        - This placement fits snugly against the existing pillar in column 3, raising the height but keeping the surface relatively flat and avoiding holes.\n    - Placing it further right (e.g., Col 4, 5, ...) would cause it to land much lower (on row 1), potentially creating gaps.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe best move appears to be placing the block rotated 90° with its leftmost edge in column 3. This fills the space next to the existing structure well.\n\nAnswer: 3 90","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to find the best move.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Board:**\n    - The board has significant height variations.\n    - There's a tall structure on the left, peaking at row 0 in column 3.\n    - There's a deep 1-column gap in column 3, starting from row 1 down to row 4.\n    - Columns 0, 1, and 2 also have gaps but are less deep or critical than column 3.\n    - The right side of the board is empty.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Block:**\n    - The block is an I-piece (straight line of 4).\n    - It can be placed horizontally (0° or 180°) or vertically (90° or 270°).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Horizontal Placements (0°\/180°):**\n    - Placing it horizontally will likely land high on the existing structure or create significant overhangs\/holes. For example, placing at coord 4 (cols 3-6) would land on top of the block at (0,3), which is undesirable. Placing lower down (e.g., coord 1 or 2) would land on row 9 but create awkward shapes. Horizontal placements do not seem optimal.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Vertical Placements (90°\/270°):**\n    - The vertical I-piece is 4 units tall.\n    - **Coord 1:** Lands on row 6 (fills col 0, rows 6-9).\n    - **Coord 2:** Lands on row 6 (fills col 1, rows 6-9).\n    - **Coord 3:** Lands on row 4 (fills col 2, rows 4-7).\n    - **Coord 4:** This is the crucial position. Column 3 has blocks at row 0 and 1. An empty space exists from row 2 downwards. The vertical block (4 units tall) attempts to fall into column 3. It will be stopped by the block at (1,3). Its lowest square will land at row 1. The block will occupy column 3 at rows 1, 2, 3, and 4. This perfectly fills the deep gap in that column.\n    - **Coords 5-10:** Land on row 9 (fills rows 6-9 in the respective column). These create deep 1-wide wells, which are generally undesirable.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    - Placing the block vertically at coordinate 4 (which corresponds to the 3rd column index) fills the most significant gap on the board perfectly. This reduces the height difference and prepares the board better for future pieces. Rotations 90° and 270° achieve the same vertical orientation. I will choose 90°.\n\nAnswer: 4 90"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Placing it flat on the bottom row (row 10) seems ideal. Placing it near the center is generally a good strategy.

Similar to the 90° rotation, this creates a taller structure early on.\n\nComparing the options, the 0° rotation placed flat on the bottom seems the most advantageous starting move. It keeps the height minimal (2 units) and provides a relatively flat surface for subsequent blocks. Placing it slightly off-center, for example at column 4, leaves space on either side.

Coord 3 is also a strong contender, resulting in a slightly flatter profile (4, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9), but Coord 2 addresses the immediate irregularity around column 3 row 7 better. I'll choose Coord 2.\n\n    - Drop Coordinate: 2 (leftmost column)\n    - Rotation Angle: 0° (any angle is fine for the square block)\n\nAnswer: 2 0","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to find the best move.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Board State:** The current board has a stack of blocks primarily on the left side, reaching row 3 (height 8 from the bottom). There's a single block at (3,8) creating a pillar, and blocks below it at (3,9), (4,9), (3,10), (4,10), (5,10), (6,10). The right side is empty.\n2.  **Current Block:** The block is an L-shape.\n3.  **Goal:** Place the block to minimize height, avoid creating holes, clear lines if possible, and create a flatter surface for future blocks.\n\n**Evaluating Options:**\n\n*   **Rotation 0° (`*00`, `***`):** Placing this would likely leave gaps or increase height significantly if placed on the left structure. Placing it on the far right (e.g., column 8) would land flat on the bottom (row 10), resulting in `Answer: 8 0`. This is safe but doesn't help the left side.\n*   **Rotation 90° (`**`, `*0`, `*0`):** Placing this at column 2 (`Answer: 2 90`) lands with its top at row 7, fitting okay but not perfectly. Placing it on the far right (e.g., column 9) lands flatly (`Answer: 9 90`), reaching row 8.\n*   **Rotation 180° (`***`, `00*`):** Placing this at column 2 (`Answer: 2 180`) collides with the block at (2,3) and lands very high – bad move. Placing it on the far right (e.g., column 8) lands flatly (`Answer: 8 180`), reaching row 9.\n*   **Rotation 270° (`0*`, `0*`, `**`):**\n    *   Placing this at column 3 (`Answer: 3 270`): The block shape `0*`, `0*`, `**` would align its column 0 with board column 3, occupying board columns 3 and 4.\n        *   The `*` at relative (0,2) (bottom-left) targets board column 3. It would collide with the `*` at board position (3,8).\n        *   This means the block's bottom row (row 2) lands on board row 8. The block's top row (row 0) lands on board row 6.\n        *   Let's visualize the placement:\n            ```\n            ..........\n            ..........\n            .**.......\n            .**.......\n            .*........\n            .**.*.....  <- Row 6 (Block row 0: 0*)\n            .**.*.....  <- Row 7 (Block row 1: 0*)\n            ..***.....  <- Row 8 (Block row 2: **)\n            ..**......\n            ..****....\n            ```\n        *   This placement fits well into the existing structure on the left, utilizes the pillar at column 3, and reduces the overall height of the stack from row 3 down to row 6. It seems like a strong move strategically.\n    *   Placing it on the far right (e.g., column 9) lands flatly (`Answer: 9 270`), reaching row 8.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nComparing `3 270` with placing the block flatly on the right (like `9 90` or `9 270`), the move `3 270` actively improves the structure on the left side and lowers the maximum height. While placing it on the right is safer in the short term by keeping the board flat, addressing the uneven left side is beneficial. Therefore, `3 270` is the chosen move.\n\nAnswer: 3 270"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The holes created by Drop 4 (90) are higher up and might be easier to manage than the low holes from Drop 2 (180).

The primary goals are to avoid creating holes, keep the stack low and flat, and clear lines if possible.\n\nLet's analyze the rotations and possible drop positions:\n\n**Rotation 0° \/ 180°:**\nShape: `** \/ 0**` (Width 3)\nPlacing this piece generally creates holes or awkward gaps on the current board structure, especially around the central stack. For instance, dropping at column 4, 5, or 6 results in unfilled spaces beneath the piece or next to the existing structure. Dropping further right (7 or 8) leaves large gaps on the left and doesn't utilize the existing blocks well.\n\n**Rotation 90° \/ 270°:**\nShape: `0* \/ ** \/ *0` (Width 2)\nThis rotation offers potentially better fits.\n- **Drop 3:** The block (`0* \/ ** \/ *0`) would fall with its leftmost part in column 3. It would land with its lowest point `*` (coordinate (3, y)) hitting the floor at y=1. The block would occupy cells (4,3), (3,2), (4,2), (3,1).\n  Resulting Board:\n  ..........\n  ..........\n  ...**.....\n  ...***....\n  ...*.**...\n  ......*...\n  ......*...\n  .....***..

The surface remains relatively playable. No lines are cleared.\n\n- **Drop 4:** The block lands with its lowest point `*` (coordinate (4, y)) resting on the block at (4,2), so it lands at y=3. It occupies (5,5), (4,4), (5,4), (4,3).\n  Resulting Board:\n  ..........\n  ..........\n  ...**.....\n  ...***....\n  ...*.**...\n  .....*.*.. (added 5,5)\n  ...***.*..

Height remains 8.\n\n- **Drop 5:** The block lands with its lowest point `*` (coordinate (5, y)) stopping due to collision with the block at (6,5) when checking placement for y=4. Block lands at y=4. It occupies (6,6), (5,5), (6,5), (5,4).\n  Resulting Board:\n  ..........\n  ..........\n  ...**.....\n  ...***....\n  ...*.***.. (added 6,6, 6,5)\n  ....**.... (added 5,5)\n  ....*.....

No lines cleared.\n\n- **Other 90° placements (e.g., Drop 6, 7):** These tend to land awkwardly, creating gaps or not fitting well with the structure below.\n\nComparing the options, Drop 3 with 90° rotation seems the most reasonable. While it doesn't clear lines and creates two holes at the very bottom, it maintains the current maximum height and leaves a relatively manageable surface compared to other placements which create more problematic holes or unevenness higher up.\n\nAnswer: 3 90","Based on the rules and the board state, I need to find the best position to drop the current block (a 2x2 square 'O' block).

Evaluate Potential Placements:**\n\n*   **Placing near the central structure (Cols 4-7):** Any placement interacting with the blocks at height 8 will result in the T-block landing high, likely occupying rows 9 or 10. For example:\n    *   `5 180°`: Lands with top at row 9, occupying (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (6,8). Max height = 9.\n    *   `6 90°`: Lands with top at row 10, occupying (6,10), (6,9), (7,9), (6,8). Max height = 10.\n    These high placements are generally undesirable early in the game as they increase the stack height without clearing lines.\n\n*   **Placing in the left well (Cols 1-3):** Heights are [0, 0, 0].\n    *   `1 0°` or `1 180°`: Lands on row 1, occupying {(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (2,2)}. Max height = 2. Creates a flat base.\n    *   `1 90°`: Lands on row 1, occupying {(1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (1,3)}. Max height = 3.\n    *   `1 270°`: Lands on row 1, occupying {(2,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3)}. Max height = 3.\n    The flat placements (0°\/180°) seem better.\n\n*   **Placing on the right side (Cols 8-10):** Heights are [0, 0, 0].\n    *   `8 0°` or `8 180°`: Lands on row 1, occupying {(8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (9,2)}.

Choose the Best Placement:**\n- Placing the block low is preferable to avoid increasing the stack height unnecessarily.\n- Both the left well (1 0°\/180°) and the right side (8 0°\/180°) offer good low, flat placements resulting in a max height of 2.\n- Placing on the right side (cols 8-10) helps balance the board, as the existing structure is slightly left-of-center.

The highest point is at column 6, reaching row 9.\n2.  **Current Block:** The block is an 'S' shape.\n    *   0°\/180°: `0**`, `**0` (Width 3, Height 2)\n    *   90°\/270°: `*0`, `**`, `0*` (Width 2, Height 3)\n3.  **Goal:** Place the block to clear lines (if possible), fill gaps, keep the stack low and level, and avoid creating new holes. No lines can be cleared immediately with this piece.\n4.  **Evaluating Placements:**\n    *   **0°\/180° Rotation:**\n        *   Placing it flat (`0**`\/`**0`) seems suitable for filling gaps.\n        *   Trying column 7 (leftmost part `**0` in col 7): The block `**0` would cover (7,y), (8,y) and `0**` would cover (8,y+1), (9,y+1). It will fall until it hits an obstacle.\n            *   The piece `*` at (7,y) would hit `*` at (7,4) if y=4.\n            *   The piece `*` at (8,y) would hit `*` at (8,1) if y=1.\n            *   The piece `*` at (8,y+1) would hit `*` at (8,8) if y+1=8 (y=7).\n            *   The piece `*` at (9,y+1) would hit `*` at (9,3) if y+1=3 (y=2).\n            *   Simulating the drop: The block at (9,y+1) hits the existing block at (9,3) when y=2. So, the block tries to land with its bottom row (`**0`) at row 2. Block positions: (7,2), (8,2), (8,3), (9,3). However, the board already has a `*` at (9,3). The block cannot land here.\n            *   It must land one row higher. Bottom row (`**0`) at row 3. Block positions: (7,3), (8,3), (8,4), (9,4). Let's check obstacles below: (7,2) empty, (8,2) empty. Board obstacles at landing position: (7,3) empty, (8,3) empty, (8,4) empty, (9,4) empty. This placement is valid.\n            *   Resulting board: Fills columns 7 and 8 at row 3, and columns 8 and 9 at row 4. This fills the gap at (8,3). This looks like a good move.\n    *   **90°\/270° Rotation:**\n        *   Placing it vertically (`*0`\/`**`\/`0*`) might fit into narrow gaps.\n        *   Trying column 8 (leftmost part `*0` or `**` in col 8): Block `*0`,`**`,`0*`. Lowest point `0*` is at col 9.\n            *   Simulating drop: `0*` at (9,y) hits `*` at (9,1) if y=1. `**` at (8,y+1), (9,y+1) hits `*` at (9,2) if y+1=2 (y=1). `*0` at (8,y+2) hits `*` at (8,8) if y+2=8 (y=6). The block stops when (9,y+1) hits (9,2), which means y=1. Block lands with bottom `0*` at row 1. Positions: (9,1), (8,2), (9,2), (8,3). Obstacles: Board has `*` at (9,1), (9,2), (10,2). This is blocked.\n            *   Let's re-simulate 90° at 8 carefully. Block shape relative to top-left corner (0,0): (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2). Drop coordinate 8 means column 8 is the reference. Block covers columns 8 and 9.\n            *   Try landing lowest point (1,2) -> (col 9, row y) on row 2. Hits (9,2). Fails.\n            *   Try landing lowest point (1,2) -> (col 9, row y) on row 3. Hits (9,3). Fails.\n            *   Try landing lowest point (1,2) -> (col 9, row y) on row 4. Needs (9,3) to be occupied. It is. Block lands with (9,4). Positions: (9,4), (8,5), (9,5), (8,6). Seems possible but leaves gaps below.\n        *   Other vertical placements also seem less optimal than the 0° placement at column 7, potentially creating holes or awkward heights.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Placing the block with 0° rotation at column 7 seems best. It fills the gap at (8,3) and integrates well with the existing structure without creating immediate problems.\n\n**Action:**\nDrop Coordinate: 7\nRotation Angle: 0\n\nAnswer: 7 0"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

All its rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) result in the same 2x2 shape.\n3.  **Goal:** Place the block optimally. Since the board is empty, the primary goal is to place it low and create a flat surface for future blocks. Any position on the bottom row is equally good in this regard.\n4.  **Choosing an Action:**\n    *   Rotation: Since all rotations are identical, we can choose 0°.\n    *   Drop Coordinate: The block is 2 units wide. Possible drop coordinates for the leftmost square range from 1 to 9. Placing it at coordinate 1 means it occupies columns 1 and 2. Placing it at coordinate 9 means it occupies columns 9 and 10. Any of these placements on the bottom row is valid. A common strategy is to start building from one side or the center. Let's choose the leftmost position for simplicity.\n\nTherefore, the action will be to drop the block with 0° rotation at coordinate 1.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","Okay, I will analyze the board state and the current block to determine the best move.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Board State:** The board has two blocks stacked vertically in the first two columns (columns 1 and 2) at the bottom two rows (rows 9 and 10). The rest of the board is empty.\n2.  **Current Block:** The block is a T-shape.\n3.  **Goal:** Find a placement that minimizes height, avoids creating holes, keeps the surface relatively flat, and ideally sets up future line clears. Clearing lines immediately is not possible.\n\n**Evaluating Rotations and Placements:**\n\n*   **0° (0*0 \/ ***):** Placing this flat side down seems reasonable.\n    *   Dropping at column 3 (`***` lands on row 10): Results in a structure 2 blocks high, covering columns 1-5. The surface is slightly uneven (cols 1-2 height 2, col 3 height 1, cols 4-5 height 2). No holes created. `Drop 3`.\n    *   Dropping at column 1 or 2 would place the `***` part on row 8, creating a hole underneath the middle `*`. Bad.\n*   **90° (*0 \/ ** \/ *0):** This is a tall piece (3 units high).\n    *   Dropping it anywhere will result in a structure at least 3 blocks high. Not ideal for minimizing height. Dropping at column 3 places `*0` on row 10, resulting height 3.\n*   **180° (*** \/ 0*0):** This orientation also has a flat side.\n    *   Dropping at column 2 (`***` lands on row 9, `0*0` lands on row 10): This fits perfectly next to the existing blocks. The `***` part lands directly on top of the `**` in columns 1 and 2, and the middle `*` lands on the floor in column 3. This creates a flat surface 2 blocks high across columns 1-4. No holes created. `Drop 2`. This looks like the best option.\n    *   Dropping at column 1 would create a hole.\n    *   Dropping at column 3 or further right creates a structure 2 high on the floor, away from the existing blocks.\n*   **270° (0* \/ ** \/ 0*):** Similar to 90°, this is 3 units high.\n    *   Dropping at column 2 places the bottom `0*` on row 8 above the existing blocks, creating a hole. Bad.\n    *   Dropping at column 3 places the bottom `0*` on row 10, resulting height 3.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe best move is to use the 180° rotation and drop the block so its leftmost column is column 2. This places the block snugly next to and on top of the existing structure, creating a flat surface 2 units high across columns 1, 2, 3, and 4 without any holes.\n\n**Action:**\nDrop Coordinate: 2\nRotation Angle: 180\n\nAnswer: 2 180","```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_occupied_heights(board):\n    heights = np.zeros(board.shape[1], dtype=int)\n    for col in range(board.shape[1]):\n        for row in range(board.shape[0]):\n            if board[row, col] == '*':\n                heights[col] = board.shape[0] -

There are some internal gaps and uneven surfaces. The right side (columns 5-10) is completely empty.\n\n**Block Analysis:**\nThe current block is an I-piece.\n- 0°\/180°: **** (4x1 horizontal)\n- 90°\/270°: * \/ * \/ * \/ * (1x4 vertical)\n\n**Objective:**\nPlace the block to clear lines if possible, minimize height, keep the board flat, and avoid creating holes.\n\n**Option Evaluation:**\n\n1.  **Vertical Placement (90°\/270°):**\n    *   Placing it vertically on the left side (columns 1-4) would create tall, thin structures (e.g., placing at column 1 would reach row 5; placing at column 2 or 3 would reach row 2), which is generally undesirable.\n    *   Placing it vertically on the right side (columns 5-10) would land on the bottom (row 10), creating a 4-block high tower in one column (e.g., 10 90 results in blocks at (7,10), (8,10), (9,10), (10,10)). This keeps the rest of the right side open but creates height.\n\n2.  **Horizontal Placement (0°\/180°):**\n    *   Placing it horizontally over the existing structure on the left is difficult without creating significant overhangs or gaps (e.g., 1 0 lands on row 8, leaving gaps; 2 0 lands on row 6, leaving gaps).\n    *   Placing it horizontally on the far right side (columns 5-10) is a good option. It would land flat on the bottom (row 10).\n        *   Placing at column 7 (7 0): Covers columns 7, 8, 9, 10 on row 10.\n        *   Placing at column 6 (6 0): Covers columns 6, 7, 8, 9 on row 10.\n        *   Placing at column 5 (5 0): Covers columns 5, 6, 7, 8 on row 10.\n    *   These horizontal placements on the right keep the board low and create a flat surface, which is generally a good strategy. Placing it furthest to the right (7 0) keeps the maximum area clear to the left of it.\n\n**Decision:**\nPlacing the I-piece horizontally on the far right seems the best strategy. It utilizes the empty space effectively, keeps the overall height low, and creates a flat base for future pieces.

The bottom row (row 1) is almost full: `**....****`.\n4.  **Option 1: Rotation 0° (****)**\n    *   Placing this horizontally across the gap in row 1 seems ideal.\n    *   If dropped at column 7 (`*******...`), the block `****` will fall to row 2, covering columns 7, 8, 9, 10.\n    *   The board would become:\n        ```\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ...*......\n        ..****....\n        .***......\n        .***......\n        ***...****  <- Block lands here\n        **....****\n        ```\n    *   This completes row 1 (`**....****` becomes `**....****` + `...****` = `*******...` + `...****` -> No, wait.

We should aim to fill this gap.\n\n1.  **Rotation 0° (00*, ***)**:\n    - Dropping at column 4 (leftmost block at col 4): The block `00*` over `***` would land with its lowest parts (`***`) at row 5. The `*` from `00*` would be at row 6, column 6. The board would become:\n      ..........\n      ..........\n      ..........\n      ......*... (6)\n      ...****... (5)\n      ..****.... (4)\n      ...\n      This fills the gap but leaves a slightly uneven top.\n\n2.  **Rotation 90° (*0, *0, **)**:\n    - Dropping at column 4 (leftmost block at col 4): The block `*0` over `*0` over `**` would land with its lowest part (`**`) at row 5.

The `***` part would be at row 6. The board would become:\n      ..........\n      ..........\n      ..........\n      ...***.... (6)\n      ...*...... (5)\n      ...*......

This seems like the best option.\n\n4.  **Rotation 270° (**, 0*, 0*)**:\n    - Dropping at column 4 (leftmost block at col 4): The block `**` over `0*` over `0*` would land with its lowest part (`0*`, specifically the `*` at col 5) at row 5. The board would become:\n      ..........\n      ..........\n      ...**..... (7)\n      ....*..... (6)\n      ....*..... (5)\n      ...*...... (Original 5) -> Merged: ....*.....\n      ..****....

It fills the gap above column 4 and creates the flattest resulting surface compared to other options.\n\nAction:\n- Drop Coordinate: 4 (the leftmost square of the 180° rotated block lands in column 4)\n- Rotation Angle: 180\n\nAnswer: 4 180","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to find the best move.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Board State:** The board has blocks stacked higher on the sides, particularly the right (columns 7-10). There's a deep gap in the middle, primarily columns 5 and 6, extending down quite low. The highest stack reaches row 2.\n2.  **Current Block:** The block is an L-shape.\n3.  **Goal:** Place the block to clear lines if possible, minimize stack height, avoid creating new holes, and create a flatter surface for future blocks. Filling the existing gap in columns 5-6 is a priority.\n\n**Evaluating Options:**\n\n*   **Rotation 0° (00* \/ ***):** Placing this generally leads to awkward fits or leaves holes, especially near the gap. Placing it at column 4 lands at row 2, filling part of the gap but leaving a hole at (4,3).\n*   **Rotation 90° (*0 \/ *0 \/ **):**\n    *   Placing at column 3 lands at row 0 and clears line 2. Score becomes 1. However, the resulting board state (`..**......\/..*.......\/...*......\/...*......\/..****...\/...***.....\/.***.....\/***...****\/**....****`) has a high peak on the left and leaves a hole at (3,2). This might not be ideal long-term.\n    *   Placing at column 5 lands high at row 0 (`.....*....\/...****...\/...*......\/...*......\/..****...\/...***.....\/.***.....\/***...****\/**....****`). Not good.\n*   **Rotation 180° (*** \/ *00):**\n    *   Placing at column 5 lands at row 5 (`...***....\/...*......\/...*......\/..****..**\/...***.*...\/...***.....\/***...****\/**....****`). This keeps the maximum height low (row 5) but creates a 3-deep hole below the piece in column 5.\n*   **Rotation 270° (** \/ 0\\* \/ 0\\*):**\n    *   Placing at column 4 lands at row 2. The block occupies (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). Resulting board: (`...**.....\/...*.*....\/...*.*....\/..****...\/...***.....\/.***.....\/***...****\/**....****`). This fills the gap in column 5 from row 4 up to row 2, leaving a relatively flat surface around row 2\/3\/4. Max height is row 2. Seems like a good option for filling the gap and maintaining a manageable board state.\n    *   Placing at column 5 lands at row 3. The block occupies (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). Resulting board: (`...***....\/...*.*....\/...*.*....\/..****.*..\/...***.....\/.***.....\/***...****\/**....****`). Also fills the gap well, max height row 3.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nComparing Rotation 270° at position 4 and position 5, position 4 seems slightly better. It places the block lower (landing at row 2 vs row 3) and fills the deeper part of the gap in column 5 more effectively, creating a flatter surface overall at row 2. While clearing a line with 90° at position 3 is possible, it creates a less stable board configuration. Minimizing height and filling gaps seems strategically better here.\n\nTherefore, the chosen action is Rotation 270°, Drop Coordinate 4.\n\nAnswer: 4 270"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The block occupies columns 5 and 6.\n- The block will fall until one of its squares hits an existing block or the bottom (row 9).\n- The points of the block relative to its top-left corner (0,0) are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2). With drop column 5, these map to board coordinates (5, y), (5, y+1), (6, y+1), (6, y+2).\n- The lowest point is at (6, y+2). It will fall until y+2 = 9 or it hits something.\n- If y+2 = 9, then y = 7. Let's check if the landing positions are clear:\n  - Board[7][5] = '.' (Empty)\n  - Board[8][5] = '.' (Empty)\n  - Board[8][6] = '.' (Empty)\n  - Board[9][6] = '.'

It keeps the stack relatively low (max height row 7).\n3. It fits reasonably well with the existing structure, creating a relatively flat top surface around columns 4, 5, 6.\n\nLet's briefly consider other options:\n- Rotation 0°\/180°: These tend to create holes or awkward gaps in the current configuration. For example, dropping at 4 would leave a hole at (3,8).\n- Rotation 90°\/270° at other positions: Dropping further left or right creates less compact structures or potential future difficulties. Drop 5 90 seems the most stable.\n\nTherefore, the chosen action is drop coordinate 5 and rotation 90°.\n\n```\nAnswer: 5 90","Okay, I will analyze the board state and the current block to determine the best move.\n\n**Game State Analysis:**\n\n*   **Board:** The current stack has a peak at column 4 (height 6) and a depression in columns 5 and 6.

The highest point is row 1 (`****......`). There are significant gaps and unevenness, especially around columns 3-8. Rows 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9 have partial fills.\n2.  **Current Block:** The current block is an 'I' shape (straight line of 4 squares). It can be placed horizontally (0° or 180°) or vertically (90° or 270°).\n3.  **Goal:** Place the block to clear lines if possible, keep the stack low, and maintain a relatively flat surface for future blocks. Avoid creating inaccessible holes.\n\n**Option Evaluation:**\n\n*   **Horizontal Placement (0° or 180° - ****):**\n    *   Placing it anywhere from column 1 to 4 would land on top of the blocks in row 1, likely causing the game to end or get very close.\n    *   Placing at column 5 (`....****...`) would land on row 5 (`....*.....`). This creates a high stack (up to row 5) and leaves gaps below.\n    *   Placing at column 6 (`.....****..`) would land on row 7 (`....**....`). This creates a stack up to row 7 and leaves gaps.\n    *   Placing at column 7 (`......****.`) would land on row 7 (`....**....`). Similar issues as placing at column 6.\n    *   Horizontal placements seem generally poor, increasing height significantly without clearing lines or improving the board structure much.\n\n*   **Vertical Placement (90° or 270° - Column of 4 '*' ):**\n    *   Column 1 or 2: Lands on row 1 (`****......`), reaching high up the board.\n    *   Column 3 or 4: Lands on row 2 (`...*......`), also quite high.\n    *   Column 5: Lands on row 5 (`....*.....`), high placement.\n    *   Column 6 or 7: Lands on row 3 (`...***....`), high placement.\n    *   Column 8: Lands on row 7 (`....**....`), moderately high placement.\n    *   Column 9: Lands on row 9 (`...***....`), filling the column from the bottom up to row 6. This looks promising.\n    *   Column 10: Lands on row 9 (bottom of the board), filling the column from the bottom up to row 6. This also looks promising.\n\n*   **Comparison (Vertical):** Placing the vertical 'I' block in columns 9 or 10 seems best. It utilizes the height of the block effectively to fill deep columns from the bottom, keeping the overall stack low and clearing space on the sides, which is often beneficial for future line clears. Placing in column 10 fills the extreme edge cleanly. Placing in column 9 leaves column 10 open, which might also be useful. Both are good options. I'll choose column 10 as it perfectly fills the edge.\n\n**Decision:** Place the block vertically (90° or 270°) in the rightmost column (column 10).\n\nAnswer: 10 90","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to determine the best move.\n\n**1. Analyze the Board and Block:**\n\n*   **Board State:**\n    ```\n    ..........  (Row 0)\n    ****......  (Row 1)\n    ...*......  (Row 2)\n    ...***....  (Row 3)\n    ...***....

Evaluate Potential Moves:**\n\n*   **Rotation 0°\/180°:** This rotation is 3 units wide. Placing it anywhere from column 1 to 4 will collide with the high structure at row 1, causing the block to land very high or potentially end the game. Placing it further right (e.g., col 5, 6, 7, 8) also results in the block landing quite high (around row 1 or 2) due to the shape interacting with the existing blocks below. This rotation does not seem ideal for filling the lower gaps.\n\n*   **Rotation 90°\/270°:** This rotation is 2 units wide and 3 units tall. It's better suited for narrower gaps. Let's check potential drop coordinates (leftmost column `x` of the shape's bounding box). The block cells are at `(x, y)`, `(x, y+1)`, `(x+1, y+1)`, `(x+1, y+2)`.\n\n    *   Placing it on the left (e.g., `x=1` to `x=4`) results in collisions high up on the board.\n    *   `x=5`: Block cells `(5,y), (5,y+1), (6,y+1), (6,y+2)`. Lands with `y=1` due to collision at `(5,3)` and `(6,3)`. Final position: `(5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3)`. Lands high.\n    *   `x=6`: Block cells `(6,y), (6,y+1), (7,y+1), (7,y+2)`.\n        - Simulating the drop: It falls until `y=6`, where `(6, y+1)=(6, 7)` collides with `Board(6, 7)=*`.\n        - It stops at `y=5`.\n        - Final position: `(6,5), (6,6), (7,6), (7,7)`.\n        - Resulting board:\n        ```\n        ..........\n        ****......\n        ...*......\n        ...***....\n        ...***....\n        ....*.*...\n        ....*.**.*\n        ....****.*\n        ....**...*\n        ...***...*\n        ```\n        This placement fits nicely into the gap starting at row 5, creating a relatively level surface around row 5\/6 on the right side.\n    *   `x=7`: Block cells `(7,y), (7,y+1), (8,y+1), (8,y+2)`. Lands with `y=0` due to collision at `(8,3)`. Lands very high.\n    *   `x=8`: Block cells `(8,y), (8,y+1), (9,y+1), (9,y+2)`. Lands with `y=0` due to collision at `(9,3)`. Lands very high.\n    *   `x=9`: Block cells `(9,y), (9,y+1), (10,y+1), (10,y+2)`. Lands with `y=1` due to collision at `(9,3)`. Lands high.\n\n**3. Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the outcomes, placing the block rotated 90° at drop coordinate 6 (`x=6`) provides the best result. It lands significantly lower than other options (`y=5` compared to `y=0` or `y=1`), fills a deep gap effectively, and helps level the board for future pieces.\n\n**4.

All these are empty.\n    - If placed with top at y=9, block occupies: (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (7,10). This conflicts with existing blocks at (5,9) and (6,9), and goes off board at (7,10).\n    - So, the block lands with its top at row y=8.\n    - Final squares occupied: (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (7,9).\n    - Resulting board:\n      ..........\n      ..........\n      ..........\n      ..........\n      ..........\n      ..........\n      ..........\n      ..........\n      ...*.***..

Creates a relatively flat surface over columns 5, 6, 7. Fills holes over (5,9) and (6,9). Leaves the hole at (4,9). This seems like a solid, safe placement.\n\n2.  **Rotation 0° (*00 \/ ***)**:\n    - Drop 7 (Columns 7, 8, 9). Lands with top at y=8. Occupies: (7,8), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9).\n    - Result: ...*...*.. \/ ...***.***. Height 8. Creates a hole under (7,8). Less ideal than option 1.\n\n3.  **Rotation 90° (** \/ *0 \/ *0)**:\n    - Most placements create significant holes or stack higher. E.g., Drop 1 lands at y=7, creating multiple holes. Drop 3 lands at y=5, stacking high.\n\n4.  **Rotation 270° (0* \/ 0* \/ **)**:\n    - Most placements create holes or stack high. E.g., Drop 5 lands at y=6, creating a hole and an uneven surface.\n\nConclusion: Rotation 180° at drop coordinate 5 is the most favorable move. It maintains the current height, fills some existing gaps partially, and leaves a relatively flat top surface without creating new immediate holes below the placed piece.\n\nAnswer: 5 180","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to find the best placement.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Board:**\n    The board has a structure in the middle bottom:\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ...****...

If dropped at column 7 (leftmost point of the 3-wide block), it covers columns 7, 8, 9.\n        *   The block shape relative coords: (1,0), (2,0), (0,1), (1,1).\n        *   Absolute coords for drop 7: (8, y), (9, y), (7, y+1), (8, y+1).\n        *   It will fall until y=8.

Less ideal than the 0° placement.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Placing the block with 0° rotation at column 7 seems like the best move. It lands neatly on the right side without creating immediate enclosed holes.\n\nAnswer: 7 0","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to find the best placement.\n\n**Game State:**\n- Epoch: 4\n- Score: 0\n- Board:\n  ```\n  ..........\n  ..........\n  ..........\n  ..........\n  ..........\n  ..........\n  .......**.\n  ......**..\n  ...****...\n  ...****...\n  1234567890\n  ```\n- Current Block (L-shape variant):\n  ```\n  0°:    90°:   180°:  270°:\n  *00    **     ***    0*\n  ***    *0     00*    0*\n         *0            **\n  ```\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe board has existing blocks primarily in the middle and right side, reaching a maximum height at row 3 (columns 7 and 8). The goal is to place the current block to clear lines if possible, minimize height increase, avoid creating holes, and maintain a relatively flat surface for future blocks.\n\nLet's evaluate the promising placements:\n\n1.  **Rotation 90°:**\n    ```\n    **\n    *0\n    *0\n    ```\n    -   **Drop Coordinate 3:** The block (shape occupying columns 3 and 4) would fall. Collision check: The block cells relative to bottom-left (3, r) are (3,r), (3,r+1), (3,r+2), (4,r+2). It collides with the block at (4,1) when r=1. The block lands at r=1. Final cells: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3).\n        Resulting Board:\n        ```\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..*.*..**.\n        ..*...**..\n        ..****....\n        ...****...\n        ```\n        This fills the gap on the left but creates a very uneven surface, reaching height 3.\n\n    -   **Drop Coordinate 9:** The block (shape occupying columns 9 and 10) would fall. Collision check: Relative cells (9,r), (9,r+1), (9,r+2), (10,r+2). It doesn't collide with existing blocks and lands on the bottom at r=0. Final cells: (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (10,2).\n        Resulting Board:\n        ```\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        .......**.\n        ......**.*.\n        ...****..*.\n        ...****..*.\n        ```\n        This fits neatly on the right edge. The maximum height of the stack remains 3 (due to the existing blocks). It creates a relatively flat area on the right side (columns 7-10 are at height 2 or 3). This seems like a good, stable placement.\n\n2.  **Rotation 180°:**\n    ```\n    ***\n    00*\n    ```\n    -   **Drop Coordinate 5:** The block (shape occupying columns 5, 6, 7) would fall. Collision check: Relative cells (7,r), (5,r+1), (6,r+1), (7,r+1). It collides with the block at (7,2) when r=2. Lands at r=2. Final cells: (7,2), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3).\n        Resulting Board:\n        ```\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ....***.*.\n        ......*.**\n        ...****...\n        ...****...\n        ```\n        This fills the central gap but creates an uneven surface, reaching height 3.\n\n**Decision:**\nComparing the outcomes, placing the block at rotation 90° and drop coordinate 9 seems the best option. It results in the lowest block placement relative to the existing structure, maintains the current maximum height, avoids creating new holes, and leaves a reasonably flat surface on the right side.\n\nAnswer: 9 90","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to find the best move.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Goal:** Place the T-shaped block to clear lines, minimize holes, and keep the stack low and flat.\n2.  **Board State:** The right side has a stack reaching row 3. The lower rows (8 and 9) have solid blocks from columns 3 to 6. There's a gap at (7, 8) and (7, 9). The area around column 6 looks like a good landing spot.\n3.  **Block Rotations:**\n    *   **0°:** Wide (3 units), might fit poorly unless placed high. Placing it at column 4 lands on row 7, covering the gap at (5, 8\/9) but leaving a gap at (4, 8\/9). Placing at 6 lands on row 6 but creates height.\n    *   **90°:** Tall (3 units), narrow (2 units). Looks promising for fitting into gaps or alongside structures. Dropping at column 6 seems ideal. The shape `** \/ * \/ *` would land with its bottom `*` (at relative position (0,2)) in column 6. It would fall until this bottom `*` hits the `*` at (6, 8). The block would occupy (6,6), (7,6), (6,7), (6,8). This fills the space nicely next to the structure at (7,7) and (8,6)\/(8,7).\n    *   **180°:** Wide (3 units). Dropping at column 6 lands the `***` part on row 6 and the single `*` on row 7 at column 8. This seems okay but potentially leaves a single hole or requires specific future blocks.\n    *   **270°:** Tall (3 units), narrow (2 units). Dropping at column 7 would land it on row 6, fitting next to the stack but leaving a gap below at (6, 7\/8). Dropping at 6 lands on row 7, which seems less optimal than 90° at 6.\n\n4.  **Decision:** The 90° rotation dropped at column 6 appears to be the best move. It fills the area to the left of the existing structure starting at column 7, creating potentially clearable lines later and maintaining a relatively flat surface.\n\n    *   Block (90°):\n        **\n        *\n        *\n    *   Drop at 6: The block lands occupying cells (6,6), (7,6), (6,7), (6,8).\n    *   Resulting Board (Conceptual):\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ........**\n        ........*.\n        ........*.\n        .....****.  <- Row 6 (Block lands here and below)\n        .....****.  <- Row 7\n        ...*****..  <- Row 8\n        ...****...  <- Row 9\n\nThis placement prepares rows 6 and 7 well for future line clears.\n\nAnswer: 6 90","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to find the best placement.\n\n**Board Analysis:**\nThe board has existing blocks primarily concentrated in the center and right side. There are gaps, notably a 1-block wide gap in column 8 down to row 7, and some incomplete rows (rows 8 and 9 are identical, rows 3-7 have various gaps). The highest stack point is column 9, reaching row 3.\n\n**Block Analysis (L-shape):**\n- **0°:** `*`\/`***` (Width 3, Height 2). Covers a 3x2 area.\n- **90°:** `**`\/`* `\/`* ` (Width 2, Height 3). Covers a 2x3 area.\n- **180°:** `***`\/`  *` (Width 3, Height 2). Covers a 3x2 area.\n- **270°:** ` *`\/` *`\/`**` (Width 2, Height 3). Covers a 2x3 area.\n\n**Strategy:**\nAim to clear lines if possible, otherwise place the block to create a flat surface, minimize holes, and avoid increasing the stack height significantly, especially in inconvenient locations.\n\n**Evaluating Placements:**\n\n1.  **Rotation 0° ( * \/ *** ):**\n    - Placing it towards the right seems most likely.\n    - Drop 7: Lands with top at row 1. Position: (7,1), (7,2), (8,2), (9,2). Final board height 8. Leaves hole at (10,2), (10,3). Okay-ish.\n2.  **Rotation 90° ( ** \/ * \/ * ):**\n    - Placing it on the left.\n    - Drop 1: Lands with top at row 7. Position: (1,7), (2,7), (1,8), (1,9). Creates deep well on left. Bad.\n3.  **Rotation 180° ( *** \/   * ):**\n    - Placing it on the right.\n    - Drop 8: Lands with top at row 2. Position: (8,2), (9,2), (10,2), (10,3). Final board height 8. Leaves holes at (8,3), (9,3). Not ideal.\n4.  **Rotation 270° (  * \/  * \/ ** ):**\n    - Drop 7: Lands with top at row 1. Position: (8,1), (8,2), (7,3), (8,3). Fills the gap at (7,3). Final board height 8. Leaves single hole at (7,4). Seems good.\n    - Drop 8: Lands with top at row 0. Position: (9,0), (9,1), (8,2), (9,2). Fills top right corner. Final board height 9. Slightly higher but clean top right.\n\n**Decision:**\nRotation 270°, Drop 7 seems slightly better. It fills an existing awkward gap at (7,3) which is beneficial for future placements, keeps the maximum height at 8 (same as Rotation 0° Drop 7, and Rotation 180° Drop 8), and leaves only one manageable hole at (7,4).\n\n**Chosen Action:**\n- Drop Coordinate: 7\n- Rotation Angle: 270\n\nAnswer: 7 270","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to find the best placement.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Board State:**\n    - The board has existing blocks reaching up to row 3 (index 2).\n    - There are notable gaps and unevenness, particularly a dip above column 6 and a deeper one above column 5.\n    - The highest stacks are in columns 7, 8, and 9, reaching row 3 (index 2).\n\n2.  **Current Block:** T-shape.\n    - 0°: `00*`, `***` (Width 3, Height 2)\n    - 90°: `*0`, `*0`, `**` (Width 2, Height 3)\n    - 180°: `***`, `*00` (Width 3, Height 2)\n    - 270°: `**`, `0*`, `0*` (Width 2, Height 3)\n\n3.  **Goal:** Place the block to clear lines if possible, minimize stack height, keep the board flat, and avoid creating holes. No line clears seem immediately possible with this T block. The focus is on minimizing height and improving flatness.\n\n4.  **Evaluating Placements:**\n    *   **Rotation 0° (T-up):**\n        *   Placing it at column 7 (`7 0`) lands with the `***` on row 3 and the `*` on row 2. This fills the right side well. Resulting board height: 8. Top surface relatively flat.\n        *   Placing it at column 5 (`5 0`) lands with `***` on row 5. Fills the deep gap partially but creates overhangs.\n    *   **Rotation 90° (T-right):**\n        *   Placing it at column 6, 7, or 8 lands the 3-height block starting from row 3. These create fairly level tops on the right side. E.g., `6 90` results in height 8.\n    *   **Rotation 180° (T-down):**\n        *   Placing it at column 6 (`6 180`) lands with the `*` on row 5 and `***` on row 4. This perfectly fills the gap above column 6 and levels the surface from columns 6-8. Resulting board height: 8. This looks like a very good fit.\n          Board state after `6 180`:\n          ..........\n          ..........\n          .......*..\n          .......***\n          ......****\n          .....*****\n          .....*.**.\n          .....***..\n          ...****...\n          ...****...\n    *   **Rotation 270° (T-left):**\n        *   Placing it at column 7 (`7 270`) lands the 3-height block starting from row 3. Fills the space above columns 7 and 8 well. Resulting board height: 8.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Several placements result in the same maximum height (8). Comparing `7 0`, `6 180`, and `7 270`, the placement `6 180` seems optimal. It directly addresses the dip above column 6 and creates a wide, flat surface from columns 6 to 8 at height level 4 (index 3), which is desirable for future placements.\n\nAnswer: 6 180","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current T-shaped block to find the best placement.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Goal:** Place the block to clear lines if possible, otherwise minimize height, avoid creating holes, and maintain a relatively flat surface for future blocks.\n2.  **Board State:** The board has several existing blocks, with the lowest empty spaces primarily on the left side (columns 1-3 go down to row 9). The highest stack reaches row 1. There are no full lines to clear immediately.\n3.  **Current Block:** T-shape.\n\n**Evaluating Rotations and Positions:**\n\n*   **0° (0*0 \/ ***):** Width 3. Placing this flat often requires a 3-wide flat surface or creates overhangs. Placing it at columns 3, 4, or 5 would land it high (on row 7) and create holes underneath.\n*   **90° (*0 \/ ** \/ *0):** Width 2, Height 3. This rotation can fit into 2-wide gaps.\n    *   Dropping at column 1: The block (* at col 1, ** at cols 1&2, * at col 1) fits perfectly into the leftmost empty space. Its lowest point (*0) lands on row 9. This fills columns 1 and 2 up to row 7\/8. This seems like a very good placement as it fills the lowest part of the board and keeps the surface relatively even.\n    *   Dropping further right quickly leads to higher placements or creating overhangs.\n*   **180° (*** \/ 0*0):** Width 3. Similar issues to 0°, but inverted. Placing it low (e.g., columns 1-4) would land on row 9 or 8 but create a hole underneath the center piece.\n*   **270° (0* \/ ** \/ 0*):** Width 2, Height 3. Symmetrical to 90°.\n    *   Dropping at column 1 or 2 would land on row 9, similar to the 90° rotation at columns 1 or 2. Dropping at column 1 (270°) looks equivalent to dropping at column 2 (90°). Dropping at column 2 (270°) looks equivalent to dropping at column 3 (90°).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe best move appears to be rotating the block 90° and dropping it in the leftmost column (column 1). This fills the deepest gap on the board without creating holes or significant overhangs.\n\n**Chosen Action:**\n\n*   Drop Coordinate: 1\n*   Rotation Angle: 90\n\nAnswer: 1 90","Okay, let's analyze the board and the block.\n\n**Board State:**\n```\n..........

No immediate line clears are possible with this piece.\n\nLet's evaluate the primary options:\n\n1.  **Horizontal (0° or 180°): `****`**\n    *   Placement at column 1: Lands on row 2. Resulting board heights: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 7, 6, 6, 3]`. Max height 8. Creates a relatively flat surface on the left but leaves the high stack in the middle\/right.\n    *   Placement at column 5: Lands on row 3. Resulting board heights: `[1, 2, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 3]`. Max height 8. Creates holes at (5,2), (6,2), (7,2).\n    *   Placement at column 7: Lands on row 5. Resulting board heights: `[1, 2, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3]`. Max height 8. Creates a significant overhang and holes.\n\n2.  **Vertical (90° or 270°): Vertical `*` stack**\n    *   Placement at column 1: Lands starting row 0, fills up to row 3. Resulting board heights: `[4, 2, 1, 1, 8, 8, 7, 6, 6, 3]`. Max height 8. Creates a spire on the far left.\n    *   Placement at column 4: Lands starting row 0, fills up to row 3. Resulting board heights: `[1, 2, 1, 4, 8, 8, 7, 6, 6, 3]`. Max height 8. Creates a spire next to the main stack.\n    *   Placement at column 10: Lands starting row 0, fills up to row 3. Resulting board heights: `[1, 2, 1, 1, 8, 8, 7, 6, 6, 4]`. Max height 8. Creates a spire on the far right, filling the gap in column 9 and creating a clean wall, which is generally good for future I-pieces.\n\n**Decision:**\nPlacing the block vertically in column 10 seems like the best move. It doesn't create immediate holes, keeps the maximum height the same (8), slightly lowers the average height compared to other options, fills an existing gap, and sets up a clean right wall which might be useful later.\n\n**Action:**\nDrop Coordinate: 10 (leftmost part of the 1x4 block is in column 10)\nRotation Angle: 90°\n\nAnswer: 10 90"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

For example, dropping at column 5 lands on row 9, creating `....***...` on the bottom row, which isn't ideal.\n2.  **Rotation 90° (*0, *0, **):** This rotation is 2 wide and 3 high. Let's test potential drop positions.\n    *   Dropping at column 8: The block shape is (* at (0,0), * at (0,1), * at (0,2), * at (1,2) relative to top-left). Drop column 8 means the block occupies columns 8 and 9. It will fall until the '*' at relative (0,2) lands on the '*' at board coordinate (8,9). This means the block's bottom row (relative y=2) lands on board row 9. The block occupies board coordinates (8,7), (8,8), (8,9), (9,9).\n        The board becomes:\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        .**....*..

Rows 7, 8, and 9 are partially filled.\n    *   Holes: There's a significant gap in column 5 and smaller gaps elsewhere.\n    *   Block: 'Z' shape.\n3.  **Evaluating Rotations and Positions:**\n\n    *   **0°\/180° (Shape: \\*\\*\/\\***): This shape is 3 wide and 2 high.\n        *   Placing it in columns 1-4 seems suboptimal, creating overhangs or inaccessible holes.\n        *   Placing at column 5 (leftmost square at column 5): Lands with its bottom row at board row 8. Coordinates (7,4), (7,5), (8,5), (8,6). Resulting board surface is relatively flat but leaves a hole at (8,4). Aggregate height increases moderately.\n        *   Placing at column 6 (leftmost square at column 6): Lands with its bottom row at board row 8. Coordinates (7,5), (7,6), (8,6), (8,7). Resulting board surface is very flat except for a dip at column 6. Creates two holes at (8,5) and (8,8) but significantly lowers the overall aggregate height compared to other options.\n        *   Placing at column 7: Lands higher up, hitting the block at (6,7).

This flatness and low height are very advantageous for future pieces. The two holes created are low down and potentially fillable. Therefore, placing the block with 0° rotation at column 6 appears to be the best move.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n*   Rotation: 0°\n*   Drop Coordinate: 6 (The leftmost square of the **0 \/ 0** block lands in column 6).\n\nAnswer: 6 0","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to find the best move.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Board State:**\n    ```\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    .....**...\n    ......**..\n    .......*..\n    .**....*..\n    ****...**.\n    **..****..\n    ```\n    The board has several gaps, notably single-width gaps in columns 1, 3, and 4 extending down to the bottom row.

For example, placing it at column 4 lands on row 8 (`...******.`), leaving a gap below in column 3. Placing it elsewhere lands even higher or creates worse gaps.\n    *   **90° (* vertical):** This piece is ideal for filling the deep single-width gaps.\n        *   **Column 1:** Dropping at coordinate 1 would place the block in rows 6, 7, 8, 9 of column 1.

Filling existing gaps (columns 3 or 4) is generally preferred over starting a new structure on the far edge (column 1). Between columns 3 and 4, both fill the gap completely. Filling column 3 seems slightly better as it prepares the ground for future line clears potentially involving columns 1 and 2.\n\nTherefore, the chosen action is to rotate the block 90° and drop it in column 3.\n\n**Action:**\nDrop Coordinate: 3\nRotation Angle: 90\n\nAnswer: 3 90","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to determine the best move.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Board State:** The board has several existing blocks, with the highest point at column 3, reaching row 6 (7 rows high). There are gaps and uneven surfaces. The lowest points are columns 0, 1, 9 at row 0.\n2.  **Current Block:** The block is an O-block (2x2 square). All rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) result in the same shape. Therefore, the rotation angle doesn't affect the placement outcome, and we can use 0°.\n3.  **Goal:** Place the O-block to minimize board height, avoid creating inaccessible holes, and ideally create a flatter surface for future blocks or set up line clears.\n4.  **Possible Placements (using 0° rotation):**\n    *   **Column 1 (Coords 1-2):** Lands on row 0. Final board height 1 at cols 1-2. Creates a 2-unit wide gap next to it (col 2).\n    *   **Column 2 (Coords 2-3):** Blocked by existing blocks at row 0. Invalid.\n    *   **Column 3 (Coords 3-4):** Lands with its bottom edge on row 2, resting on the block at (3, 1). Final board height 3 at col 3, 4 at col 4. Fills the space above (3,1) but leaves a hole at (2,2).\n    *   **Column 4 (Coords 4-5):** Blocked by existing blocks at row 0. Invalid.\n    *   **Column 5 (Coords 5-6):** Blocked by existing blocks at row 0. Invalid.\n    *   **Column 6 (Coords 6-7):** Lands with its bottom edge on row 2, resting on the block at (6, 1). Final board height 3 at cols 6-7. Fills the gap above (6,1), creating a flatter surface from columns 5 to 7 at height 2. Leaves hole at (7,0) and (7,1) uncovered.\n    *   **Column 7 (Coords 7-8):** Lands with its bottom edge on row 3, resting on the block at (7, 2). Final board height 4 at cols 7-8. Increases peak height in that area.\n    *   **Column 8 (Coords 8-9):** Lands with its bottom edge on row 2, resting on the block at (8, 1). Final board height 3 at cols 8-9. Creates a hole at (7,2).\n    *   **Column 9 (Coords 9-10):** Lands on row 0. Final board height 2 at cols 9-10. Places the block on the far right edge.\n\n5.  **Decision:**\n    *   Placing at column 1 or 9 keeps the height low but doesn't address the central gaps well.\n    *   Placing at column 3 or 8 creates or exposes holes.\n    *   Placing at column 7 increases the height.\n    *   Placing at column 6 seems the most reasonable. It fills the gap above the block at (6,1), creating a more level surface in the middle right section (columns 5-7) at height 2. This prepares the board better for subsequent blocks compared to other options.\n\n**Chosen Action:**\nDrop Coordinate: 6\nRotation Angle: 0\n\nAnswer: 6 0","Based on the heuristics of minimizing board height, reducing the number of holes, and creating a flatter surface, placing the 'S' block with 0 degrees rotation at column 3 seems optimal.\n\nAnalysis:\n1.  **Rotation 0°:**\n    -   Shape:\n        ```\n        **0\n        0**\n        ```\n    -   If dropped at column 3 (index 2), it covers columns 3, 4, and 5.\n    -   It will fall until its lowest squares (at relative y=0) land on the highest occupied squares in columns 4 and 5, or its other squares collide.\n    -   Column heights: Col 3 (idx 2): 7, Col 4 (idx 3): 7, Col 5 (idx 4): 2.\n    -   The block `(2,9), (3,9), (3,8), (4,8)` will land successfully.\n    -   Resulting board state:\n        ```\n        ..........\n        ...**......\n        ..**.......\n        .....**...\n        ..*..**...\n        ..*..**...\n        ..*...**..\n        ..*....*..\n        .**....*..\n        ****...**.\n        **..****..\n        ```\n    -   This placement results in a maximum height of 10, leaves the existing hole at (3,2), and creates a relatively flat top surface at height 9\/10.\n\n2.  **Rotation 90°:**\n    -   Shape:\n        ```\n        0*\n        **\n        *0\n        ```\n    -   Placing this rotation often leads to more holes or less stable structures on the current board configuration (as analyzed in thought block). For example, placing at column 3 (index 2) lands at y=7 resulting in a board height of 10, similar bumpiness, but lower aggregate height. Placing at column 4 (index 3) lands at y=7, resulting in board height 10, slightly worse bumpiness, and an additional hole.\n\nComparing the best options, Rotation 0° at column 3 provides a good balance.\n\nAnswer: 3 0","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to find the best move.\n\n**Game State Analysis:**\n- Epoch: 9\n- Score: 0\n- Board:\n..........\n..........\n..**.**...\n..*****...\n..*..**...\n..*...**..\n..*....*..\n.**....*..\n****...**.\n**..****..\n- Current Block (S-shape):\n  0°: **0 \/ 0**\n  90°: 0* \/ ** \/ *0\n  180°: **0 \/ 0**\n  270°: 0* \/ ** \/ *0\n\n**Goal:** Place the block to clear lines if possible, maintain a relatively flat stack, and avoid creating inaccessible holes.\n\n**Evaluating Options:**\n\n1.  **Rotation 0° (or 180°):** Shape `**0 \/ 0**` (Width 3, Height 2)\n    - Try placing at coordinate 1: Lands covering (1,8), (2,8), (2,9), (3,9). Fills and clears row 9. Resulting top row (new row 9): `** *...**.` (Two single gaps).\n    - Try placing at coordinate 6: Lands covering (6,8), (7,8), (7,9), (8,9). Fills and clears row 9. Resulting top row (new row 9): `****.* **.` (Two single gaps).\n\n2.  **Rotation 90° (or 270°):** Shape `0* \/ ** \/ *0` (Width 2, Height 3)\n    - Try placing at coordinate 3: Lands covering (4,7), (3,8), (4,8), (3,9). Fills and clears row 9. Resulting top row (new row 9): `** ****.**.` (One double gap).\n    - Try placing at coordinate 8: Lands covering (9,7), (8,8), (9,8), (8,9). Does *not* clear row 9. Resulting row 9: `**..*****.`.\n\n**Decision:**\nComparing the line-clearing options:\n- Rot 0°, Coord 1: Clears line 9, leaves `** *...**.` (two single gaps).\n- Rot 0°, Coord 6: Clears line 9, leaves `****.* **.` (two single gaps).\n- Rot 90°, Coord 3: Clears line 9, leaves `** ****.**.` (one double gap).\n\nClearing a line is good. Leaving a single double gap (Option 3) is generally better than leaving two single gaps (Options 1 and 2), as it's easier to fill later. Therefore, placing the block with 90° rotation at coordinate 3 is the best move.\n\n**Action:**\n- Drop Coordinate: 3\n- Rotation Angle: 90\n\nAnswer: 3 90"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The Max Height heuristic only looks at the peak, which might be less informative. Holes and Bumpiness calculation seem correct now.\nBased on the AggH score, 4 0 (-41) is better than 5 0 (-57).

(1)\nColumn heights: [0, 0, 2, 4, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nHoles are empty cells *below* the highest block in that column.\nCol 3: H=2. Check (3,1). It's filled ('*'). No holes.\nCol 4: H=4. Check (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). (4,1)='*', (4,2)='*', (4,3)='*'. No holes.\nCol 5: H=3. Check (5,1), (5,2). (5,1)='*', (5,2)='*'. No holes.\nCol 6: H=2. Check (6,1). (6,1)='*'. No holes.\nIt seems the hole count is indeed 0 for placements 3 0 and 6 0.\n\nComparing 3 0 and 6 0 (both score -15): They result in similar board states, just mirrored. Choosing either seems fine. Let's pick 3 0 as it's further left.\n\nFinal check of scores:\n3 0: Score -15\n6 0: Score -15\n4 0: Score -41\n5 0: Score -57\nOther placements landing at row 1 likely have similar AggH\/Bumpiness scores to 3 0\/6 0, but might create different hole patterns depending on exact column.\nLet's check 2 0:\nBoard:\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n....*.....

I'll choose 3 0.\nRotation angle is 0.\n\nResult: Drop coordinate 3, Rotation 0.\nThe O-block doesn't rotate, so 0 is fine.\nCoordinate is the leftmost column, 1-indexed. So 3.\n\n\n```\nAnswer: 3 0\n```","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to find the best move.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Board State:**\n    - The board has existing blocks forming an uneven surface, primarily on the left and center, reaching up to row 6 (4 rows from the bottom).\n    - The highest points are columns 3, 4, 5 at row 6.\n    - There are some gaps, notably at (2,8), (2,9), (6,8), (6,9), (7,8), (7,9), (8,8), (8,9), (9,8), (9,9), (10,8), (10,9).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Current Block (Z-shape):**\n    - 0°\/180°: `**0`, `0**` (Width 3, Height 2)\n    - 90°\/270°: `0*`, `**`, `*0` (Width 2, Height 3)\n\n3.  **Evaluate Potential Moves:**\n    - **Goal:** Place the block to minimize height, avoid creating holes, and potentially clear lines (though none are close currently). A flat surface is generally preferred.\n\n    - **Rotation 0°\/180°:**\n        - Placing this shape often creates overhangs or holes with the current board configuration. For example, placing it at column 7 (`7 0`) lands on row 8, creating a hole at (7,9).\n        ```\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..***.....\n        ..****....\n        ...***.**..\n        ....**.*.*. <-- Hole at (7,9)\n        ```\n\n    - **Rotation 90°\/270°:**\n        - This orientation is vertical and might fit better into the gaps on the right side.\n        - Let's test column 9 (`9 90`). The shape `0*`, `**`, `*0` has its leftmost point in the first column of its 2x3 bounding box. Drop coordinate 9 means the block's bounding box starts at column 9. The block occupies columns 9 and 10.\n        - Shape squares relative to top-left (9, y): (10, y), (9, y+1), (10, y+1), (9, y+2).\n        - It will fall until its lowest point (9, y+2) rests just above row 9 or an existing block.\n        - Checking the landing spot: It can land with its bottom at row 9 (y+2=9 -> y=7).\n        - Occupied squares: (10,7), (9,8), (10,8), (9,9).\n        - Board state check:\n            - Row 7: `..****....` -> (10,7) is empty. OK.\n            - Row 8: `...***....` -> (9,8) and (10,8) are empty. OK.\n            - Row 9: `....**....` -> (9,9) is empty. OK.\n        - Final Board:\n        ```\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..***.....\n        ..****....*\n        ...***..**.\n        ....**..*..\n        ```\n        - This placement results in a maximum height of 4 rows, creates no new holes, and leaves a relatively flat surface on the right.\n\n    - Let's test column 8 (`8 90`). Leftmost bounding box col 8. Occupies cols 8, 9.\n        - Shape squares relative to top-left (8, y): (9, y), (8, y+1), (9, y+1), (8, y+2).\n        - Lands with bottom at row 9 (y=7).\n        - Occupied squares: (9,7), (8,8), (9,8), (8,9).\n        - Final Board:\n        ```\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..***.....\n        ..****...*\n        ...***.**..\n        ....**.**..\n        ```\n       - Also height 4, no holes. Surface is slightly less flat than `9 90`.\n\n    - Let's test column 7 (`7 90`). Leftmost bounding box col 7. Occupies cols 7, 8.\n        - Shape squares relative to top-left (7, y): (8, y), (7, y+1), (8, y+1), (7, y+2).\n        - Lands with bottom at row 9 (y=7).\n        - Occupied squares: (8,7), (7,8), (8,8), (7,9).\n        - Final Board:\n        ```\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..***.....\n        ..****..*.\n        ...****.**..\n        ....**.*...\n        ```\n       - Height 4, no holes. Surface is less flat than `8 90` and `9 90`.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    - Placing the block rotated 90° seems better than 0°.\n    - Among the 90° placements, columns 7, 8, and 9 all result in a height of 4 and no holes.\n    - Column 9 (`9 90`) provides the flattest resulting surface on the right, which is generally preferable for future placements.\n\nAnswer: 9 90","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to determine the best move.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Board State:**\n    ```\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..***.....

(Row 1)\n       1234567890\n    ```\n    The current structure has some holes, notably at (6,3), (7,3), (9,3), (7,2), (8,2), (10,2), (9,1), and (10,1). The highest occupied squares are in row 4 (columns 3, 4, 5).\n\n2.  **Current Block:** Z-shape\n    *   0°\/180°:\n        ```\n        **0\n        0**\n        ```\n        (Width 3, Height 2)\n    *   90°\/270°:\n        ```\n        0*\n        **\n        *0\n        ```\n        (Width 2, Height 3)\n\n3.  **Goal:** Place the block to minimize board height, fill holes if possible, create flat surfaces, and avoid creating new hard-to-fill holes.\n\n4.  **Evaluating Options (0°\/180° Rotation):**\n    *   Placing it towards the left (columns 1-5) will land it low on the board (row 1 or 2) and create significant gaps or increase height unevenly.\n    *   **Column 7 (0°):** Lands with its bottom row at board row 3. Occupies (7,4), (8,4), (8,3), (9,3).\n        *   Resulting board height: 4.\n        *   Fills hole at (9,3).\n        *   Creates hole at (6,3).\n        *   Surface: `..***.*.**`\n    *   **Column 8 (0°):** Lands with its bottom row at board row 3. Occupies (8,4), (9,4), (9,3), (10,3).\n        *   Resulting board height: 4.\n        *   Fills holes at (9,3) and (10,3).\n        *   Creates hole at (7,3).\n        *   Surface: `..***..**..` (Relatively flat)\n\n5.  **Evaluating Options (90°\/270° Rotation):**\n    *   Placing it towards the left or middle generally increases height significantly or creates deep holes.\n    *   **Column 9 (90°):** Lands with its bottom row at board row 2. Occupies (10,4), (9,3), (10,3), (9,2).\n        *   Resulting board height: 4.\n        *   Fills holes at (9,3), (10,3), (9,2).\n        *   Creates hole at (8,2).\n        *   Surface: `..***....*` (Leaves columns 6, 7, 8 empty at row 3\/4)\n\n6.  **Decision:** Comparing the best options (Column 7 at 0°, Column 8 at 0°, Column 9 at 90°), Column 8 at 0° seems optimal. It maintains the lowest possible height increase (to row 4), fills the problematic holes on the far right (9,3 and 10,3), and leaves a relatively flat surface (`..***..**..`). While it creates a new hole at (7,3), this seems less problematic than the alternatives.\n\n**Chosen Action:** Drop Coordinate 8, Rotation Angle 0°.\n\nAnswer: 8 0","```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_occupied_squares(block_shape, rotation):\n    \"\"\"Gets the coordinates of the occupied squares for a given block shape and rotation.\"\"\"\n    rotations = {\n        0: block_shape['0'],\n        90: block_shape['90'],\n        180: block_shape['180'],\n        270: block_shape['270']\n    }\n    shape = rotations[rotation]\n    occupied = []\n    for r, row_str in enumerate(shape):\n        for c, char in enumerate(row_str):\n            if char == '*':\n                # Coordinates relative to top-left of the shape's bounding box\n                occupied.append((r, c))\n    return occupied, len(shape[0]), len(shape) # relative coords, width, height\n\ndef parse_board(board_str):\n    \"\"\"Parses the board string into a numpy array.\"\"\"\n    lines = board_str.strip().split('\\n')\n    height = len(lines)\n    width = len(lines[0])\n    board = np.zeros((height, width), dtype=int)\n    for r, line in enumerate(lines):\n        for c, char in enumerate(line):\n            if char == '*':\n                board[r, c] = 1\n    return board, height, width\n\ndef check_collision(board, piece_coords, r_offset, c_offset, board_height, board_width):\n    \"\"\"Checks if the piece collides with existing blocks or board boundaries.\"\"\"\n    for r, c in piece_coords:\n        board_r, board_c = r + r_offset, c + c_offset\n        if board_c < 0 or board_c >= board_width or board_r >= board_height: # Check boundaries\n            return True\n        if board_r >= 0 and board[board_r, board_c] == 1: # Check collision with existing blocks\n                return True\n    return False\n\ndef find_landing_row(board, piece_coords, drop_col_1_based, board_height, board_width):\n    \"\"\"Finds the final row (0-based from top) where the piece lands.\"\"\"\n    # drop_col_1_based is the leftmost column (1 to width) of the piece's bounding box\n    c_offset = drop_col_1_based - 1 # 0-based column index\n    r_offset = 0 # Start checking from the top\n\n    # Move piece down until it collides\n    while True:\n        # Check collision at the next row (r_offset + 1)\n        if check_collision(board, piece_coords, r_offset + 1, c_offset, board_height, board_width):\n            # Collision detected at next step, so current r_offset is the landing row\n            return r_offset\n        r_offset += 1\n        # Should not happen in standard Tetris unless piece starts colliding, but safety check\n        if r_offset >= board_height:\n             # This case means the piece would fall off the board, shouldn't happen if floor exists\n             # Or if the piece starts below the board - error\n             # For this game, it means landing at the very bottom row possible\n             # We need the row index *before* it would collide with the floor (height)\n             # Let's rethink: if it lands at the bottom, the lowest block part is at height-1.\n             # The r_offset represents the top row index of the piece's bounding box.\n             # If check_collision returns true for r_offset+1 == board_height, it means a part of the piece\n             # has hit the floor.

All rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) result in the same shape:\n    ```\n    **\n    **\n    ```\n    Therefore, the rotation angle doesn't impact the final shape or placement strategy. I'll use 0°.\n2.  **Board State:** The board has several gaps and uneven surfaces. The highest points are in columns 8 and 9 (reaching row 3). The lowest reachable surface is generally around rows 7-9.\n3.  **Goal:** Place the block to minimize height, avoid creating new holes, fill existing holes if possible, and ideally set up future line clears.\n4.  **Evaluating Placements (using 0° rotation):**\n    *   **Columns 1, 2:** Lands on row 6. Creates a high stack on the left and significant overhangs\/holes. Poor choice.\n    *   **Column 3:** Lands on row 7 (resting on the block at (3,8)). Leaves a single hole at (3,8).\n        ```\n        ..**....**\n        ..****...*\n        ...***..**\n        ....**..*.\n        ```\n    *   **Column 4:** Lands on row 8 (resting on blocks at (4,9) and (5,9)). Fills the gap at (5,8). This looks like a good placement, keeping the stack low and level.\n        ```\n        ..***...**\n        ..****...*\n        ...***..**\n        ...***..*.\n        ```\n    *   **Column 5:** Lands on row 8 (resting on blocks at (5,9) and (6,8)). Creates a single hole at (7,8).\n        ```\n        ..***...**\n        ..****...*\n        ...***..**\n        ....****.*.\n        ```\n    *   **Column 6:** Lands on row 5 (resting on the block at (7,6)). Creates a significant overhang. Poor choice.\n    *   **Column 7:** Lands on row 3 (resting on the block at (8,4)). Places the block very high. Poor choice.\n    *   **Column 8:** Lands on row 2 (resting on the block at (9,3)). Places the block very high. Poor choice.\n    *   **Column 9:** Lands on row 3 (resting on the block at (9,4)). Places the block very high. Poor choice.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Placing the block at column 4 seems optimal. It lands at the lowest possible level (row 8), fills an existing gap, and maintains a relatively flat surface compared to other options. Since rotation doesn't matter, 0° is chosen.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to find the best placement.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Board and Block:**\n    *   The board has several existing blocks, mostly concentrated in the middle and right side, with varying heights. The highest points are at column 8 (row 3) and column 9 (row 4), and column 10 (row 5).\n    *   The current block is a 2x2 square (O-block). Its rotation does not change its shape.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Potential Placements:**\n    *   I need to find a placement that ideally clears lines, keeps the stack low, and avoids creating holes.\n    *   Let's test possible drop coordinates (leftmost column, 1-9):\n        *   **Columns 1-2:** Would land high on the left, creating a hole. Bad.\n        *   **Column 3:** Lands on row 3. Fills columns 3 and 4. Creates a flat surface there but doesn't clear lines. Max height remains 9.\n        *   **Column 4:** Lands on row 6 (due to col 5). Creates a hole under it at (5,8). Bad.\n        *   **Column 5:** Lands on row 7 (due to col 5). Creates a hole under it at (6,9). Bad.\n        *   **Column 6:** Lands on row 4. Fills columns 6 and 7. Creates a relatively flat surface. Max height remains 9.\n        *   **Column 7:** Lands on row 2. Creates a high stack on the right.\n        *   **Column 8:** Lands on row 3. Fills columns 8 and 9. The block occupies (8,3), (9,3), (8,4), (9,4). This completes row 4 (`...**...****`). Clearing this line is beneficial. The resulting board state after clearing the line seems reasonable.\n        *   **Column 9:** Lands on row 4. Fills columns 9 and 10. The block occupies (9,4), (10,4), (9,5), (10,5). This completes row 5 (`...**..*****`). Clearing this line is also beneficial.\n\n3.  **Compare Best Options (Column 8 vs Column 9):**\n    *   **Drop at 8 (0°):** Lands at (8,3)\/(9,4). Clears row 4. Score +1. The board after clear will have rows 0-2 empty, row 3 empty, row 4 becomes the old row 3 (`........*.`), row 5 becomes the old row 5 (`...**..***`), etc. The max height remains 9, but the overall structure looks good, and a line is cleared.\n    *   **Drop at 9 (0°):** Lands at (9,4)\/(10,5). Clears row 5. Score +1. The board after clear will have rows 0-2 empty, row 3 (`........*.`), row 4 (`...**...**`), row 5 becomes the old row 6 (`..***...**`), etc. Max height becomes 8.\n\n4.  **Decision:**\n    *   Both dropping at 8 and 9 clear a line. Dropping at 8 clears row 4, while dropping at 9 clears row 5.\n    *   Dropping at 8 results in the block landing lower (bottom at row 3) compared to dropping at 9 (bottom at row 4).\n    *   Clearing row 4 by dropping at column 8 seems slightly better as it deals with a lower obstruction first. The resulting board profile after the drop at 8 looks slightly better managed than the drop at 9, despite the max height difference after the clear.\n\n5.  **Final Action:**\n    *   Drop Coordinate: 8\n    *   Rotation Angle: 0° (any angle works, 0 is standard)\n\nAnswer: 8 0","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to find the best placement.\n\n**1.

(Row 9)\n(Row 10 is the bottom)\n\nThe board has some gaps, particularly lower down on the left side (columns 1-3) and a significant gap in column 3. The right side (columns 7-10) is built higher.\n\n**2.

Evaluate Potential Placements (Heuristics: Minimize Height, Holes, Bumpiness):**\n\nLet's denote the placement by `(column, rotation)`. The column refers to the 1-based index of the leftmost column occupied by the block after it lands. Landing simulation assumes the block drops until any part hits an existing block or the floor, and the `drop_coordinate` refers to the leftmost column the final placed block occupies.\n\n*   **Rotation 0° (00* \/ ***):**\n    *   (3, 0°): Lands low, but leaves a hole above column 3. Height increases.\n    *   (4, 0°): Lands on row 8. Max height 8. Creates hole at (8,4). Bumpiness increases.\n    *   (8, 0°): Lands high on row 4. Max height 8. Increases height significantly.\n\n*   **Rotation 90° (*0 \/ *0 \/ **):**\n    *   (3, 90°): Lands with anchor at (7, 2). Block occupies (7,2), (8,2), (9,2), (9,3). Max height 10. Fills the left gap well. Final board heights: [0, 0, 10, 10, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 7]. Bumpiness sum: 17.\n    *   (4, 90°): Lands with anchor at (7, 3). Block occupies (7,3), (8,3), (9,3), (9,4). Max height 10. Final board heights: [0, 0, 3, 10, 10, 6, 8, 8, 8, 7]. Bumpiness sum: 19.\n\n*   **Rotation 180° (*** \/ *00):**\n    *   (4, 180°): Lands with anchor at (7, 3). Block occupies (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3). Max height 9 (column 4). Final board heights: [0, 0, 3, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7]. Bumpiness sum: 11. No holes created. Relatively flat top surface compared to others.\n    *   (5, 180°): Lands with anchor at (8, 4). Block occupies (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (9,4). Max height 10. Final board heights: [0, 0, 3, 8, 10, 9, 9, 8, 8, 7]. Bumpiness sum: 13.\n\n*   **Rotation 270° (** \/ 0* \/ 0*):**\n    *   (3, 270°): Lands with anchor at (7, 2). Block occupies (7,2), (7,3), (8,3), (9,3). Max height 10. Final board heights: [0, 0, 9, 10, 8, 6, 8, 8, 8, 7]. Bumpiness sum: 15. Leaves gap at (8,2).\n    *   (4, 270°): Lands with anchor at (7, 3). Block occupies (7,3), (7,4), (8,4), (9,4). Max height 10. Final board heights: [0, 0, 3, 9, 10, 6, 8, 8, 8, 7]. Bumpiness sum: 15. Leaves gap at (8,3).\n\n**4. Select the Best Move:**\n\nComparing the best options:\n*   (3, 90°): Max H=10, Bumpiness=17. Fills left gap.\n*   (4, 180°): Max H=9, Bumpiness=11. Lowest max height, lowest bumpiness, reasonable surface.\n\nThe placement (4, 180°) results in the lowest maximum height (9) and the lowest bumpiness sum (11) among the viable options considered, without creating any new holes.\n\n**5.

Generally, this means placing it flat on the bottom, avoiding holes, and keeping the overall height low.\n4.  **Rotation Options:**\n    *   **0°\/180° (`**0`, `0**`):** This is a 3-wide, 2-high shape. Placing it flat on the bottom is possible. For example, dropping at column 2 results in `.**.......`, `..**......` at the bottom.\n    *   **90°\/270° (`0*`, `**`, `*0`):** This is a 2-wide, 3-high shape. Placing it flat on the bottom is also possible. For example, dropping at column 1 results in `.*........`, `**........`, `*.........` at the bottom.\n5.  **Decision:** Both rotations can be placed flat on the empty board. The 0°\/180° rotation results in a structure that is only 2 units high, while the 90°\/270° rotation results in a structure 3 units high. Keeping the board height lower is generally preferred early on. Placing the 0° rotation block somewhat centrally seems reasonable to keep options open. Let's choose column 4.\n\n**Simulated Placement (4 0):**\nThe block `**0`, `0**` starting with its leftmost '*' at column 4 will land on rows 9 and 10.\nRow 9: `...**.....`\nRow 10: `....**....`\nThis placement is flat on the bottom row and relatively central.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","Okay, I will analyze the board and the falling block to find the optimal placement.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Board State:** The current board has two small block structures at the bottom: `**` at row 9 (cols 4, 5) and `**` at row 10 (cols 5, 6). There's an overhang at (9,4) with empty space below it at (10,4). The highest occupied row is 9.\n\n2.  **Current Block:** It's a variant of the L-shape block.\n\n3.  **Goal:** Place the block to minimize height, avoid creating holes, create flat surfaces for future blocks, and potentially clear lines (though not immediately possible here).\n\n4.  **Evaluating Options:**\n    *   **0° (`*00`, `***`):** Placing this at col 4 lands with its bottom at row 8 (`...*...` at row 7, `...***...` at row 8). This bridges the existing structures nicely but creates a hole at (9,6) and reaches height 7.\n    *   **90° (`**`, `*0`, `*0`):** Placing this at col 5 lands with its bottom at row 8 (`.....**...` at row 6, `.....*....` at row 7, `.....*....` at row 8). Reaches height 6, creates no holes, but leaves a gap in column 4.\n    *   **180° (`***`, `00*`):** Placing this at col 3 lands with its bottom at row 9 (`....*.....` at row 8, `..***.....` at row 9). Reaches height 8.\n    *   **270° (`0*`, `0*`, `**`):** Placing this at col 3 lands with its bottom at row 8 (`...*......` at row 6, `...*......` at row 7, `..**......` at row 8). This reaches height 6, creates no holes, and perfectly fills the space under the block at (9,4).\n\n5.  **Decision:** Comparing the best options:\n    *   (0°, 4): Height 7, creates hole.\n    *   (90°, 5): Height 6, no hole, leaves gap.\n    *   (270°, 3): Height 6, no hole, fills gap.\n\n    Placing the block with 270° rotation at column 3 (270°, 3) seems optimal. It keeps the height low (matching the lowest possible height achieved by 90°, 5), avoids creating holes, and fills an existing overhang, leading to a more stable structure.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe chosen action is to place the block rotated 270° with its leftmost edge at column 3.\n\nAnswer: 3 270","```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef parse_board(board_str):\n    lines = board_str.strip().split('\\n')\n    board = np.array([[1 if c == '*' else 0 for c in line] for line in lines])\n    return board\n\ndef parse_block_rotations(block_str):\n    rotations = {}\n    parts = block_str.strip().split('\\n\\n')\n    for part in parts:\n        lines = part.split('\\n')\n        angle = int(lines[0].replace('°:', ''))\n        shape_str = lines[1:]\n        shape = np.array([[1 if c == '*' else 0 for c in row] for row in shape_str])\n        # Find the minimum row and column index containing a block part '*'\n        block_indices = np.argwhere(shape == 1)\n        if block_indices.size == 0:\n            min_r, min_c = 0, 0\n        else:\n            min_r = block_indices[:, 0].min()\n            min_c = block_indices[:, 1].min()\n        # Trim the shape to the smallest bounding box starting from the top-leftmost '*'\n        trimmed_shape = shape[min_r:, min_c:]\n        rotations[angle] = trimmed_shape\n    return rotations\n\ndef get_occupied_coords(block_shape):\n    coords = np.argwhere(block_shape == 1)\n    return set(tuple(coord) for coord in coords)\n\ndef check_collision(board, block_shape, r, c):\n    block_coords = get_occupied_coords(block_shape)\n    board_height, board_width = board.shape\n    for br, bc in block_coords:\n        board_r, board_c = r + br, c + bc\n        # Check boundaries\n        if board_c < 0 or board_c >= board_width or board_r >= board_height:\n            return True\n        # Check collision with existing blocks\n        if board[board_r, board_c] == 1:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef place_block(board, block_shape, c):\n    # Find the row to place the block\n    r = 0\n    # Initial vertical position (starts above the visible board, typically row -block_height)\n    # For simplicity, start checking from row 0 downwards\n    place_r = -1 # Sentinel value\n    current_r = 0\n    block_height = block_shape.shape[0]\n\n    while True:\n        # Check if the block can be placed at current_r + 1\n        if check_collision(board, block_shape, current_r + 1, c):\n            place_r = current_r # Place at the last valid row\n            break\n        current_r += 1\n        # Check if block has fallen off the board (should be caught by check_collision with bottom boundary)\n\n    # Update the board\n    new_board = board.copy()\n    block_coords = get_occupied_coords(block_shape)\n    board_height, board_width = board.shape\n    max_placed_row = -1\n    for br, bc in block_coords:\n        board_r, board_c = place_r + br, c + bc\n        if 0 <= board_r < board_height and 0 <= board_c < board_width:\n             new_board[board_r, board_c] = 1\n             max_placed_row = max(max_placed_row, board_r)\n        elif board_r < 0: # Block placed partially or fully above the board top\n             return None # Invalid move, game over potentially\n\n    # Check if block exceeds top boundary after placement\n    if place_r < 0 : # Needs refinement based on actual game rules about where blocks spawn\n        pass # Assume valid for now if it lands within board area\n\n    # Clear lines\n    rows_to_clear = []\n    for r_idx in range(board_height):\n        if np.all(new_board[r_idx, :] == 1):\n            rows_to_clear.append(r_idx)\n\n    lines_cleared = len(rows_to_clear)\n    if lines_cleared > 0:\n        # Shift rows down\n        rows_to_keep = np.array([new_board[r_idx,:] for r_idx in range(board_height) if r_idx not in rows_to_clear])\n        empty_rows = np.zeros((lines_cleared, board_width), dtype=int)\n        new_board = np.vstack((empty_rows, rows_to_keep))\n\n\n    return new_board, lines_cleared\n\ndef calculate_score(board):\n    # Heuristic score: prioritize lower height, fewer holes, completed lines, flatter surface\n    height, width = board.shape\n\n    # 1.

There's a significant gap in column 3 down to row 6 and a smaller gap in column 4 down to row 7. The right side is mostly empty.\n2.  **Current Block:** The 'S' block (`0**`, `**0` at 0°\/180°; `*0`, `**`, `0*` at 90°\/270°).\n3.  **Goal:** Place the block to minimize height, avoid creating holes, and potentially set up future line clears.\n\n**Evaluating Rotations and Positions:**\n\n*   **0°\/180° (`0**`, `**0`)**:\n    *   Placing this generally creates overhangs or lands high on the existing structure. For example, placing it at column 1 or 2 creates immediate holes. Placing it further right lands high.\n*   **90°\/270° (`*0`, `**`, `0*`)**:\n    *   **Column 3:** The block (`*` at (3,y), `**` at (3,y+1) & (4,y+1), `*` at (4,y+2)) would fall. The bottom-most part (`*` at (4, y+2)) would be stopped by the block at (4, 7). The block would settle occupying (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), and (4,7). This fits neatly into the gap next to the column of three blocks (`...*...` at rows 5, 6, 7).\n    *   **Column 4:** The block (`*` at (4,y), `**` at (4,y+1) & (5,y+1), `*` at (5,y+2)) would fall. The bottom-most part (`*` at (5, y+2)) would be stopped by the block at (5, 8). The block would settle occupying (4,6), (4,7), (5,7), and (5,8). This also fits reasonably well.\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n*   Placing at Column 3 (90°) results in the block occupying rows 5, 6, and 7.\n*   Placing at Column 4 (90°) results in the block occupying rows 6, 7, and 8.\n\nPlacing at Column 3 (90°) keeps the overall structure slightly lower and fills a useful gap. It seems like the better strategic move.\n\n**Decision:** Place the block rotated 90° at column 3.\n\nAnswer: 3 90","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to determine the best move.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Board State:** The board has existing blocks concentrated towards the left and center, with heights varying significantly. The highest points are column 2 (row 2), column 3 (row 3), column 4 (row 4), column 5 (row 9), and column 6 (row 10). Columns 1, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are empty near the top.\n2.  **Current Block:** The current block is a 2x2 square (O-block). All rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) result in the same shape. Therefore, the rotation angle chosen (e.g., 0°) will not affect the block's final position or shape.\n3.  **Goal:** The primary goals are to avoid ending the game, clear lines if possible (currently not possible with this block and board state), and maintain a relatively flat and low stack height to facilitate future placements.\n4.  **Possible Moves (Drop Coordinate x for leftmost square, Rotation 0°):**\n    *   x=1: Lands high on column 2, bottom at row 3. Creates uneven surface [H: 2, 2, 7, 6, 9, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Max H: 10.\n    *   x=2: Lands on columns 2 & 3. Column 2 is filled up to row 2. Block would land starting at row 0. GAME OVER.\n    *   x=3: Lands on columns 3 & 4. Block lands high, bottom at row 2. Creates hole\/uneven surface [H: 0, 8, 1, 1, 9, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Max H: 10.\n    *   x=4: Lands on columns 4 & 5. Block lands high, bottom at row 3. Creates uneven surface [H: 0, 8, 7, 2, 2, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Max H: 10.\n    *   x=5: Lands on columns 5 & 6. Block lands on top of blocks at row 9 (col 5) and row 10 (col 6). It will stop when its bottom hits the block at row 9 in column 5. The block's bottom rests on row 9, occupying rows 8 and 9. Resulting height profile [H: 0, 8, 7, 6, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Max H: 8. Relatively flat surface in cols 5-6.\n    *   x=6: Lands on columns 6 & 7. Block lands on top of block at row 10 (col 6). Bottom rests on row 10, occupying rows 9 and 10. Resulting height profile [H: 0, 8, 7, 6, 9, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]. Max H: 9. Leaves a gap below in col 5.\n    *   x=7: Lands on columns 7 & 8. Both are empty. Block lands at the bottom, occupying rows 9 and 10. Resulting height profile [H: 0, 8, 7, 6, 9, 10, 9, 9, 0, 0]. Max H: 10. Flatter on the right.\n    *   x=8: Lands on columns 8 & 9. Both are empty. Block lands at the bottom, occupying rows 9 and 10. Resulting height profile [H: 0, 8, 7, 6, 9, 10, 0, 9, 9, 0]. Max H: 10. Flatter on the right.\n    *   x=9: Lands on columns 9 & 10. Both are empty. Block lands at the bottom, occupying rows 9 and 10. Resulting height profile [H: 0, 8, 7, 6, 9, 10, 0, 0, 9, 9]. Max H: 10. Flatter on the right.\n\n5.  **Decision:** Comparing the outcomes, placing the block at x=5 results in the lowest maximum height (8) and creates a relatively flat surface in the middle (columns 5 and 6 at height 8). This seems preferable to placing it on the far right, which increases the maximum height to 10, or placing it further left, which creates significant unevenness or gaps. Rotation 0° is chosen as it doesn't affect the outcome.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe chosen action is to drop the block starting at column 5 with 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to find the best move.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Board State:** The board has several filled rows at the bottom, with some gaps and unevenness, particularly around columns 3-7. The highest point is at row 1.\n2.  **Current Block:** The block is an inverted L-shape.\n3.  **Goal:** Place the block to lower the overall height, fill gaps, create potential line clears, and maintain a relatively flat surface.\n\n**Evaluating Options:**\n\n*   **Rotation 0° ( *00 \/ *** ):**\n    *   Dropping at column 5 seems promising. It would land with its base (`***`) on row 6, fitting into the existing structure. The `*` above would land on row 5.\n    *   Board after 0° at 5:\n        ```\n        ..........\n        ..*.......\n        ..**......\n        ...*......\n        ****......\n        ....*.....

It would land with its lowest `*` on row 6, the one above on row 5, and the top `**` on row 4.\n    *   Board after 90° at 6:\n        ```\n        ..........\n        ..*.......\n        ..**......\n        ...*......\n        ****.* *..

Less ideal than 0° at 5.\n\n*   **Rotation 180° ( *** \/ 00* ):**\n    *   Placing this generally creates overhangs or lands awkwardly on the current structure. For example, placing at column 6 lands on rows 8 and 9, leaving gaps.\n\n*   **Rotation 270° ( 0* \/ 0* \/ ** ):**\n    *   Placing this often leaves gaps. Placing at column 7 lands on rows 6, 7, 8, fitting somewhat on the right side but not as neatly as 0° at 5.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe placement with rotation 0° at drop coordinate 5 appears to be the most advantageous. It lands low, fills existing gaps effectively, and maintains a relatively flat surface without creating immediate holes.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to find the best placement.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Board:**\n    The board has several gaps and uneven surfaces, particularly a deeper section on the right side. There's a notable empty space at column 5, row 2 (`...**.....`). The highest blocks are at row 9.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Block:**\n    The current block is an S-shape.\n    -   0°\/180°: `0** \/ **0` (Width 3, Height 2)\n    -   90°\/270°: `*0 \/ ** \/ 0*` (Width 2, Height 3)\n\n3.  **Evaluate Potential Placements:**\n    *   **Rotation 0°\/180° (`0** \/ **0`)**:\n        *   Trying to place it flat often creates holes low down or rests unstably.\n        *   Placing it at column 5: The `**0` part (row 1) would target columns 5 and 6. Column 5 has a block at row 2 (`...**.....`), and column 6 has a block at row 2 (`....**....`). The block would land with its bottom row at row 3.\n            *   Block occupies: (5,3), (6,3) and (6,4), (7,4).\n            *   Resulting board surface looks like: `..**...... \/ ...*...... \/ *****..... \/ ...****... \/ ...***.** \/ ..****.** \/ ...**..... \/ ....**....`\n            *   This placement fills row 3 partially, keeps the hole at (5,2) accessible, and results in moderate bumpiness. Max height becomes 9.\n        *   Placing it at column 6: The `**0` part targets columns 6 and 7. Column 6 has a block at row 2, column 7 has a block at row 4 (`...***....`). The block would rest on (6,2), landing its bottom row at row 3.\n            *   Block occupies: (6,3), (7,3) and (7,4), (8,4).\n            *   Resulting board surface: `...***.*** \/ ..****.**..` This creates a slightly wider gap above row 2.\n    *   **Rotation 90°\/270° (`*0 \/ ** \/ 0*`)**:\n        *   Placing it at column 4: The `0*` part (bottom right) targets column 5. It needs to clear the block at (5,2). The block would land with its lowest point `(5,*)` at row 3.\n            *   Block occupies: (5,3), (4,4), (5,4), (4,5).\n            *   Resulting board surface: `...*.*.... \/ ...****... \/ ..****.*..` This fills the gap above (5,2) but creates a slightly uneven surface. Max height becomes 9.\n        *   Other placements with this rotation tend to land higher or create significant gaps.\n\n4.  **Compare Options:**\n    *   Option 0° Col 5 seems reasonable. It lands relatively low (bottom at row 3), doesn't create new immediate holes, and maintains access to the existing hole at (5,2). The bumpiness is acceptable.\n    *   Option 90° Col 4 also seems reasonable. It fills the gap above (5,2) but might create a slightly less desirable surface for subsequent pieces compared to Option 0° Col 5.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Placing the block with 0° rotation at column 5 appears to be the most balanced move, minimizing immediate risks and maintaining flexibility.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to find the best move.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Board and Goal:**\n    *   The board has significant gaps, especially in the middle columns (3-6).\n    *   The highest points are on the left (column 2, row 9) and right-middle (column 8, row 8).\n    *   The goal is to place the 'L' block to clear lines if possible, keep the stack low, avoid creating new holes, and create a flatter surface for future blocks. No lines can be cleared immediately with this piece.

Creates a slightly flatter surface than 0° at 7.\n\n    Comparing 180° at 6 and 180° at 7, placing at 6 fits slightly better into the existing structure and keeps the highest point slightly more centered.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The best move is to place the block rotated 180° with its leftmost edge at column 6.\n\nAnswer: 6 180","Okay, let's analyze the board and the falling block ('I' shape).\n\n**Board Analysis:**\nThe board has several gaps and uneven stacks. The most significant feature is the deep empty channel in columns 9 and 10, reaching down to the bottom (row 10). The highest stack is in columns 6 and 7, reaching row 1.\n\n**Block Analysis:**\nThe current block is an 'I' shape (4 squares long).\n- 0°\/180° rotation: **** (1x4)\n- 90°\/270° rotation: * (4x1)\n                      *\n                      *\n                      *\n\n**Evaluating Placements:**\n\n1.  **Horizontal (0° or 180°):** Placing the 1x4 block horizontally looks problematic.\n    - Dropping it anywhere in the middle (e.g., columns 3-7) would land it high up on the existing stacks (around rows 2 or 3), creating significant overhangs and holes underneath.\n    - Dropping it on the sides (e.g., columns 1-2 or 8-10) would also land relatively high and potentially create difficult shapes or cover needed gaps. Overall, horizontal placements seem poor.\n\n2.  **Vertical (90° or 270°):** Placing the 4x1 block vertically seems much more promising, especially targeting the deep gaps.\n    - **Column 9:** The column is completely empty. A vertical block dropped here would fall all the way to the bottom, landing on row 10. It would occupy squares (9,10), (9,9), (9,8), and (9,7). This perfectly fills the 4-unit deep gap on the right side, leaving column 10 open and creating a relatively flat surface next to column 8.\n    - **Column 10:** Similar to column 9, this column is empty. Dropping the vertical block here would also land it on row 10, occupying (10,10), (10,9), (10,8), and (10,7). This also fills the gap perfectly but creates a wall on the right edge.\n    - **Other Columns:** Dropping vertically in other columns (like 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) would fill smaller gaps but land higher up on the board, potentially creating less stable structures compared to filling the deep right-side channel. For example, dropping in column 8 would land on row 4. Dropping in columns 6 or 7 would land on row 2.\n\n**Decision:**\nPlacing the vertical 'I' block in either column 9 or 10 is the best strategy. Both fill the deep gap perfectly and land at the lowest possible level (row 10). Placing it in column 9 leaves the far-right column (10) open, which is generally a slight tactical advantage for future pieces. Placing it in column 10 creates a solid wall on the right. Both are good, but leaving column 10 open (placement in column 9) offers slightly more flexibility. We will choose column 9 with a 90° rotation (270° yields the same result).\n\n**Chosen Action:**\n- Drop Coordinate: 9 (leftmost square of the 1-wide block is in column 9)\n- Rotation Angle: 90°\n\nAnswer: 9 90","Based on the board state and the 'T' block shapes, I will evaluate potential placements to minimize board height, fill gaps, and avoid creating holes.\n\nBoard State:\n.....***..

Covers columns 6 and 7.\n    - The highest occupied cells in columns 6 and 7 are at row 0 (board height 10).\n    - The block is 3 rows high. It will land with its lowest part (`*` at relative row 2) on row 9.\n    - The block will occupy rows 7, 8, and 9. Top row of the block will be 7.\n    - Added cells: (6,7), (6,8), (7,8), (6,9).\n    - Resulting row 9: `....**.*.*.`\n    - This fills the gap above column 6 and 7, landing low.\n\n2.  **Rotation 270°, Drop Coordinate 6 (Column 5):**\n    - Block shape: `0*`, `**`, `0*`. Covers columns 5 and 6.\n    - The highest occupied cells in columns 5 and 6 are at row 5 and row 0 respectively (heights 5 and 10).\n    - The block needs to clear column 6's height. It will land with its lowest part (`*` at relative row 2) on row 9.\n    - The block will occupy rows 7, 8, and 9. Top row of the block will be 7.\n    - Added cells: (6,7), (5,8), (6,8), (6,9).\n    - Resulting row 9: `....*****..`\n    - This fills the gap above columns 5 and 6 perfectly, creating a flat surface on row 9 and landing low.\n\nComparing these two options, the placement `6 270` creates a flatter surface on the bottom (`....*****..`) compared to `7 90` (`....**.*.*.`). This generally leads to better future placements and potential line clears. Therefore, `6 270` is the preferred move.\n\nAnswer: 6 270"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The board becomes `...*...`, `...***...`, `...****...` from row 7 to 9. This looks like a decent placement, filling the space to the left of the existing structure.\n*   **180° (*** \/ 0*0):** Placing this upside down might fit over the structure, but could create holes underneath. Dropping at column 4 would land on row 8, creating holes at (4, 8) and (6, 8). Dropping at column 3 lands on row 8, creating a hole at (3, 9).\n*   **270° (0* \/ ** \/ 0*):** This is the mirror image of the 90° rotation. Dropping at column 5 lands the block with its base at row 9. The board becomes `.....*...`, `....***..`, `...****..` from row 7 to 9. This also looks like a good placement, filling the space to the right.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nBoth 90° at column 4 and 270° at column 5 are good candidates. They both result in a similar height (up to row 7) and fill the area around the existing blocks without creating holes. Let's choose the 270° rotation at column 5. It results in the following configuration:\n\nRow 7: `.....*....`\nRow 8: `....***...`\nRow 9: `...****...`\n\nThis placement keeps the structure relatively central and low.\n\n**Action:** Drop Coordinate: 5, Rotation Angle: 270\n\nAnswer: 5 270","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to find the best placement.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Board:**\n    - The board has existing blocks concentrated in the middle-left.\n    - The highest stack is at column 4 and 5, reaching row 7 (4 blocks high).\n    - There's a gap at column 5, row 9.\n    Board:\n    ..........

It keeps the overall structure lower and the hole at (8, 4) might be slightly easier to manage than the hole at (8, 7).\n\n4.  **Final Decision:** Place the block with 0° rotation at drop coordinate 2.\n\nAnswer: 2 0","Okay, I will analyze the board and the falling block to determine the optimal move.\n\n1.  **Analyze the board state:**\n    The board has existing blocks concentrated in the middle and slightly to the left, with the highest points at row 6 (column 5) and row 7 (columns 2, 3, 4, 6). The right side is relatively empty.\n    ```\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    .....*....\n    .**.**....\n    ..****....\n    ...***....\n    ```\n\n2.  **Analyze the current block:**\n    The block is a 2x2 square (O-piece). All rotation states (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) result in the same shape:\n    ```\n    **\n    **\n    ```\n    Therefore, the rotation angle does not affect the placement. I will use 0°.\n\n3.  **Evaluate potential drop positions (leftmost column 1-9):**\n    I need to find a position that minimizes board height, avoids creating holes, and ideally sets up future line clears.\n\n    *   **Columns 1-3:** Placing the block here would land it relatively high (around row 5 or 6) and create holes underneath in rows 7, 8, 9.\n    *   **Columns 4-7:** Placing the block here would land it very high (around row 4 or 5) due to the existing blocks in columns 5, 6, and 7. This would create significant gaps and increase the board height substantially.\n    *   **Column 8:** Dropping the block with its left edge at column 8 (occupying columns 8 and 9) would land it on top of the block at (8,8). The block would occupy rows 6 and 7.\n        ```\n        .....*..** (row 6)\n        .**.**..** (row 7)\n        ..****.... (row 8)\n        ...***....

The block would occupy rows 8 and 9.\n        ```\n        ..****..** (row 8)\n        ...***..** (row 9)\n        ```\n        This lands at height 8 (lowest part of the block), creates no new holes, and fills the right edge of the board nicely.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Placing the block at column 9 seems optimal. It results in the lowest landing position for the block itself, avoids creating holes, and keeps the overall stack height relatively low compared to other options. The rotation angle is irrelevant, so 0° is chosen.\n\nAnswer: 9 0","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to find the best move.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Board State:**\n    ```\n    ..........

Bad.\n        *   Placing it at X=7 (columns 6, 7, 8) lands at row 6 (`r=6`). Cells: (6,6), (6,7), (7,7), (7,8). This covers the existing `*` at (6,5) partially and leaves a hole at (6,5).

The board state would become:\n      ```\n      ..........\n      ..........\n      .*........\n      **.......*\n      **.......*\n      **.****.**  <- Piece lands here (Row 6)\n      **....****\n      .*...*.**.\n      .**.**.*..\n      ..********\n      ...****.**\n      ```\n    - This results in a maximum height of 8. It creates a relatively flat surface but leaves the well in column 10 untouched and creates some dependency on future blocks fitting the small gaps created.\n\n2.  **Rotation 90° (Vertical):**\n    - **Option A: Fill the well (drop_coordinate 10):**\n      - The piece would drop into column 10.\n      - The highest existing block in column 10 is at row 7.\n      - The 4-unit high block would land with its base on row 8, occupying cells (10,8), (10,9), (10,10), and (10,11).\n      - The board state would become:\n      ```\n      .........* (Row 11)\n      .........* (Row 10)\n      .*.......* (Row 9)\n      **.......* (Row 8)\n      **.......*\n      **....****\n      .*...*.**.\n      .**.**.*..\n      ..********\n      ...****.**\n      ```\n      - This increases the maximum height significantly to 11. However, it perfectly fills the deep well, setting up a potential Tetris (4-line clear) if subsequent blocks can fill rows 8, 9, 10, and 11 horizontally. This aligns with a common Tetris strategy.\n    - **Option B: Fill internal gaps (e.g., drop_coordinate 3):**\n      - Placing it in column 3 would land it starting at row 5, occupying (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8).\n      - The board state would become:\n      ```\n      ..........\n      ..........\n      .**....... (Row 8)\n      ***......* (Row 7)\n      ***......* (Row 6)\n      .**...**** (Row 5)\n      .*...*.**.\n      .**.**.*..\n      ..********\n      ...****.**\n      ```\n      - This results in a maximum height of 8. It fills an internal gap nicely but leaves the well in column 10.\n\n**Decision:**\n- Placing the I-piece horizontally (0°) keeps the stack lower but doesn't utilize the piece's unique ability to clear deep wells and doesn't address the existing well.\n- Placing the I-piece vertically (90°) to fill the well (coord 10) is strategically advantageous for setting up a Tetris, even though it increases the stack height considerably. At epoch 10, there's enough game left to justify this risk for a potentially large score increase later. Filling internal gaps (like coord 3) is less optimal as it doesn't solve the main problem (the well) and doesn't offer the Tetris setup.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to place the I-piece vertically in the rightmost column.\n\nAnswer: 10 90"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Placing it on the left side leads to very high stacks or many holes.\n    - **180°:** Placing it flat far right (col 7) results in `Heights: [2, 2, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3]`, Max Height 3, 0 Holes, Bumpiness 7.\n    - **270°:** Placing it vertically far right (col 8) results in `Heights: [2, 2, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4]`, Max Height 4, 0 Holes, Bumpiness 8. Placing it near the existing structure (col 3) also increases height and creates a hole.\n\n4.  **Select Best Placement:**\n    - Comparing the best options (low height, no holes): 90° Col 8 and 180° Col 7.\n    - Both result in Max Height 3, 0 Holes, and Bumpiness 7.\n    - The 180° placement at column 7 `[2, 2, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3]` seems slightly better as it fills columns 7, 8, 9 consecutively. The 90° placement at column 8 `[2, 2, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3]` leaves column 7 empty.\n    - Therefore, placing the block rotated 180° with its leftmost edge at column 7 is the chosen action.\n\nAnswer: 7 180","```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef parse_board(board_str):\n    lines = board_str.strip().split('\\n')\n    board = np.array([[1 if c == '*' else 0 for c in line] for line in lines])\n    return board\n\ndef parse_block_rotations(block_str):\n    rotations = {}\n    parts = block_str.strip().split('\\n\\n')\n    for part in parts:\n        lines = part.split('\\n')\n        angle = int(lines[0].replace('°:', ''))\n        shape_str = lines[1:]\n        shape = np.array([[1 if c == '*' else 0 for c in line] for line in shape_str])\n        # Find the minimal bounding box\n        rows, cols = np.where(shape == 1)\n        if rows.size == 0: # Handle empty shapes if necessary, though unlikely for Tetris blocks\n             min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col = 0, -1, 0, -1\n        else:\n            min_row, max_row = rows.min(), rows.max()\n            min_col, max_col = cols.min(), cols.max()\n        # We need the shape relative to its top-left in the definition, including '0's\n        # Find the top-left of the *definition* (not just the '*')\n        shape_height, shape_width = shape.shape\n        # Keep the shape as defined, including the '0's that define its rotation point and extent\n        rotations[angle] = shape\n    return rotations\n\ndef get_block_dims(block):\n    if block.size == 0:\n        return 0, 0\n    return block.shape\n\ndef check_collision(board, block, r, c):\n    board_h, board_w = board.shape\n    block_h, block_w = block.shape\n    if c < 0 or c + block_w > board_w or r + block_h > board_h:\n        # Out of bounds horizontally or below board\n        return True\n    if r < 0: # allow parts of block above board initially\n         block = block[-r:,:] # take part of block that is on board\n         block_h, block_w = block.shape\n         r = 0 # start checking from top row\n\n    if r + block_h > board_h: # Check if block goes below the board\n        return True # Should not happen if drop logic is correct, but good for safety\n\n    board_slice = board[r:r+block_h, c:c+block_w]\n\n    # Check collision only where the block has a piece (1)\n    collision_map = (board_slice == 1) & (block == 1)\n    return np.any(collision_map)\n\n\ndef place_block(board, block, c):\n    board_h, board_w = board.shape\n    block_h, block_w = block.shape\n    r = 0\n    # Find the row where the block comes to rest\n    while True:\n        if check_collision(board, block, r + 1, c):\n            break\n        r += 1\n\n    # Check if block is placed entirely above the board top (game over condition)\n    final_r = r\n    block_rows, block_cols = np.where(block == 1)\n    if block_rows.size > 0:\n        min_block_row_idx = block_rows.min()\n        if final_r + min_block_row_idx < 0:\n             # This placement results in game over, treat as invalid or highest penalty\n             return None # Or return a board indicating game over \/ high cost\n\n    # Add the block to the board\n    new_board = board.copy()\n    for br in range(block_h):\n        for bc in range(block_w):\n            if block[br, bc] == 1:\n                board_r, board_c = r + br, c + bc\n                # Ensure placement is within board bounds vertically after settling\n                if 0 <= board_r < board_h and 0 <= board_c < board_w:\n                    new_board[board_r, board_c] = 1\n                elif board_r < 0: # Part of block ends up above the board top boundary\n                    # Game over condition\n                    return None # Indicate invalid placement \/ game over\n\n    # Check for and clear completed lines\n    lines_cleared = 0\n    rows_to_clear = []\n    for row_idx in range(board_h):\n        if np.all(new_board[row_idx, :] == 1):\n            rows_to_clear.append(row_idx)\n\n    if rows_to_clear:\n        lines_cleared = len(rows_to_clear)\n        # Remove cleared lines\n        new_board = np.delete(new_board, rows_to_clear, axis=0)\n        # Add empty lines at the top\n        empty_lines = np.zeros((lines_cleared, board_w), dtype=int)\n        new_board = np.vstack((empty_lines, new_board))\n\n    return new_board, lines_cleared\n\ndef calculate_heuristics(board):\n    if board is None: # Game over state\n        return float('inf') # Highest possible penalty\n\n    board_h, board_w = board.shape\n\n    # 1.

There are gaps, but no immediate line clears are obvious without placing the current block. The highest occupied squares are in row 6.\n2.  **Current Block:** The current block is a 2x2 square (O-Tetromino). All rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) result in the same shape.\n3.  **Goal:** Place the block to clear lines if possible, minimize height, avoid creating hard-to-fill holes, and keep the top surface relatively flat.\n\n**Evaluating Options (using 0° rotation as all are identical):**\n\n*   **Drop Coordinate 1 (Columns 1-2):** The block lands on top of the '*' at (9,1) and (9,2). It occupies (8,1), (8,2), (9,1), (9,2). This fills Row 9 completely.\n    *   Board after drop:\n        ```\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        .**...***.\n        ..**...*..\n        **....***.\n        *********.\n        ```\n    *   Result: Row 9 is cleared. Score +1. The remaining board is relatively flat. This looks like the best option.\n*   **Drop Coordinate 2 (Columns 2-3):** Lands on (8,2) and (8,3). Creates a hole at (7,4). Bad.\n*   **Drop Coordinate 3 (Columns 3-4):** Lands on (7,3) and (7,4). Creates a hole at (6,2). Bad.\n*   **Drop Coordinate 4 (Columns 4-5):** Lands on Row 9. Creates a hole at (8,3). Bad.\n*   **Drop Coordinate 5 (Columns 5-6):** Lands on Row 9. Creates a hole at (8,4). Bad.\n*   **Drop Coordinate 6 (Columns 6-7):** Lands on (6,6) and (6,7). Increases height significantly and leaves gaps. Very bad.\n*   **Drop Coordinate 7 (Columns 7-8):** Lands on (6,7) and (6,8). Increases height significantly and leaves gaps. Very bad.\n*   **Drop Coordinate 8 (Columns 8-9):** Lands on (8,8) and (8,9). Creates a hole at (7,9). Bad.\n*   **Drop Coordinate 9 (Columns 9-10):** Lands on (7,9) and (9,10). Creates multiple holes. Bad.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nPlacing the block at coordinate 1 clears Row 9 and leaves the board in a good state for subsequent blocks. Since all rotations are the same, 0° is chosen.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to find the best move.\n\n1.  **Analyze the board:**\n    *   The board has existing blocks, mainly on the left and in the middle-right area.\n    *   Highest points are columns 1 and 2 (height 6).\n    *   There are gaps and uneven surfaces, notably around columns 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10.\n    *   The goal is to place the block to potentially clear lines (none possible immediately), minimize height, create a flatter surface, and avoid creating problematic holes.\n\n2.  **Analyze the block:**\n    *   The block is an 'S' shape.\n    *   Orientation 0°\/180°: `**0`, `0**` (Width 3, Height 2)\n    *   Orientation 90°\/270°: `0*`, `**`, `*0` (Width 2, Height 3)\n\n3.  **Evaluate potential moves:**\n\n    *   **Orientation 0° (and 180°):** `**`, `.**`\n        *   Placing this usually creates overhangs or holes with the current board structure. For example, placing at column 3 lands at row 6, creating a hole at (3,5). Placing at column 7 lands at row 6, creating a hole at (7,5). These are not ideal.\n\n    *   **Orientation 90° (and 270°):** `.*`, `**`, `*.`\n        *   Column 1: Lands very high (row 8).\n        *   Column 3: Lands starting at row 5, reaching height 7. `...*`, `..**`, `.*.*` fits reasonably but increases height significantly.\n        *   Column 5: Lands starting at row 3, reaching height 5. Block occupies (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5). This fits nicely onto the structure at (5,2) and (6,4). It keeps the height relatively low (max height 6) and fills a gap. The resulting surface profile is [6, 6, 4, 4, 4, 5, 4, 4, 3, 1].\n        *   Column 6: Lands starting at row 5, reaching height 7.\n        *   Column 7: Lands starting at row 5, reaching height 7.\n        *   Column 9: Lands starting row 3, reaching height 5. Fits low but doesn't level the board well.\n\n4.  **Compare options:**\n    *   Orientation 90° generally fits better than 0°.\n    *   Comparing the 90° placements, column 5 offers the best combination:\n        *   Lowest resulting maximum height (6).\n        *   Fills existing gaps reasonably well.\n        *   Creates a relatively flat surface in the middle section.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The best move is to rotate the block 90° and drop it at column 5.\n\nAnswer: 5 90","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current piece to find the best move.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Board State:** The board has blocks stacked primarily on the left (cols 1-2) and right (cols 7-10), with the middle section being lower but containing several gaps. The highest stacks are in columns 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10. Notable gaps exist around (6,2), (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), etc.\n2.  **Current Block:** The current block is an 'S' shape.\n    *   0°\/180° ( `0**`\/`**0` ): Width 3, Height 2.\n    *   90°\/270° ( `*0`\/`**`\/`0*` ): Width 2, Height 3.\n3.  **Goal:** Place the block to minimize board height, reduce bumpiness (differences in adjacent column heights), fill existing gaps, and potentially set up line clears without creating new inaccessible holes.\n\n**Evaluation of Potential Moves:**\n\nLet's evaluate some promising placements using heuristics like aggregate height (sum of column heights, lower is better) and bumpiness (sum of height differences between adjacent columns, lower is better).\n\n1.  **Rotation 0°, Drop Coordinate 3:**\n    *   Lands at row `y=5`. Occupies (6,3), (5,4), (6,4), (5,5).\n    *   Resulting Board Heights: [6, 6, 4, 4, 4, 5, 4, 2, 2, 1]\n    *   Aggregate Height: 38. Bumpiness: 7.\n    *   Comment: Creates a relatively flat area but leaves the hole at (6,2) and lands moderately high.\n\n2.  **Rotation 90°, Drop Coordinate 3:**\n    *   Lands at row `y=4`. Occupies (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4).\n    *   Resulting Board Heights: [6, 6, 5, 4, 4, 2, 4, 2, 2, 1]\n    *   Aggregate Height: 37. Bumpiness: 9.\n    *   Comment: Lands high, leaves a hole at (5,2), and increases bumpiness.\n\n3.  **Rotation 90°, Drop Coordinate 2:**\n    *   Lands at row `y=5`. Occupies (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (7,3).\n    *   Resulting Board Heights: [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 1]\n    *   Aggregate Height: 31. Bumpiness: 9.\n    *   Comment: Significantly lowers the aggregate height compared to other options. Fills the existing hole at (6,2). While bumpiness is 9, the low height and hole filling make this very attractive.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nComparing the options, Rotation 90° at Drop Coordinate 2 provides the lowest aggregate height (31) and fills the hole at (6,2). This seems strategically sound for long-term board stability.\n\n**Action:**\n\nDrop Coordinate: 2\nRotation Angle: 90\n\nAnswer: 2 90","```\n1. Analyze the board state and the current block ('I' shape).\n2. Evaluate potential placements for both rotations (0° and 90°).\n   - The goal is to place the block to minimize board height, avoid creating holes\/gaps, and potentially clear lines or set up future line clears.\n\n3. **Rotation 0° (****):**\n   - Width is 4. Possible drop coordinates: 1-7.\n   - Placing horizontally generally creates significant overhangs or fits poorly on the current uneven surface. For instance, placing at column 4 (drop coordinate 4) would land on row 4, leaving a large gap underneath in columns 4-7. Placing at column 7 lands on row 5, also leaving gaps. This rotation seems unfavorable.\n\n4. **Rotation 90° (Vertical I):**\n   - Width is 1, Height is 4. Possible drop coordinates: 1-10.\n   - Evaluate placements based on where the bottom of the 4-unit high block lands.\n   - Drop 1: Lands on row 5 (bottom at row 5, top at row 8). Fills column 1. Board height remains 8. Seems okay.\n   - Drop 2: Lands on row 6 (bottom at row 6, top at row 9). Increases board height to 9. Less desirable.\n   - Drop 3: Lands on row 7 (bottom at row 7, top at row 10). Increases board height to 10. Bad.\n   - Drop 4: Lands on row 5 (bottom at row 5, top at row 8). Height 8.\n   - Drop 5: Lands on row 6 (bottom at row 6, top at row 9). Height 9.\n   - Drop 6: Lands on row 5 (bottom at row 5, top at row 8). Height 8.\n   - Drop 7: Lands on row 8 (bottom at row 8, top at row 11). Increases height to 11. Very bad.\n   - Drop 8: Lands on row 5 (bottom at row 5, top at row 8). Height 8.\n   - Drop 9: Lands on row 3 (bottom at row 3, top at row 6). Board height remains 8. This fills the gap in column 9 at row 2 and builds vertically in column 9.\n     Board state after drop 9, 90°:\n     ..........\n     ..........\n     .*........\n     .**.......\n     ***.......\n     **......*. (Top)\n     .**...***.\n     ..**.*.*.*\n     .**.*****.*\n     **..*...*.* (Bottom)\n   - Drop 10: Lands on row 5 (bottom at row 5, top at row 8). Height 8. Fills column 10.\n\n5. **Comparison:**\n   - Rotation 0° is generally bad.\n   - Rotation 90° offers several options that keep the max height at 8 (Drop 1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10).\n   - Comparing Drop 1 (column 1), Drop 9 (column 9), and Drop 10 (column 10):\n     - Drop 1 levels the left side.\n     - Drop 10 levels the right side.\n     - Drop 9 fills column 9, landing lower (row 3) than drops 1 or 10 (row 5), and specifically fills the gap created previously at (9,2). This seems the most beneficial placement as it addresses an existing gap without increasing height and works towards leveling the uneven right side.\n\n6. **Conclusion:** The best move is to rotate the block 90 degrees and drop it so its leftmost (and only) column aligns with column 9.\n\nAnswer: 9 90\n```","```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_piece_coords(piece, rotation):\n    \"\"\"Gets coordinates for a specific rotation.\"\"\"\n    return np.array(np.where(piece[rotation] == '*')).T\n\ndef parse_board(board_str):\n    \"\"\"Converts board string to numpy array.\"\"\"\n    lines = board_str.strip().split('\\n')\n    board = np.array([[1 if c == '*' else 0 for c in row] for row in lines])\n    return board\n\ndef parse_piece(piece_str):\n    \"\"\"Parses the piece string into rotation variations.\"\"\"\n    rotations = {}\n    current_rot = None\n    piece_lines = []\n    for line in piece_str.strip().split('\\n'):\n        if ':' in line:\n            if current_rot is not None:\n                rotations[int(current_rot[:-1])] = np.array([[c for c in row] for row in piece_lines])\n            current_rot = line.strip()\n            piece_lines = []\n        else:\n            piece_lines.append(line)\n    if current_rot is not None:\n        rotations[int(current_rot[:-1])] = np.array([[c for c in row] for row in piece_lines])\n    return rotations\n\ndef check_collision(board, piece_coords, r, c):\n    \"\"\"Checks if placing the piece at (r, c) collides.\"\"\"\n    board_height, board_width = board.shape\n    for pr, pc in piece_coords:\n        nr, nc = r + pr, c + pc\n        # Check boundaries\n        if not (0 <= nr < board_height and 0 <= nc < board_width):\n            return True\n        # Check collision with existing blocks\n        if board[nr, nc] == 1:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef find_landing_row(board, piece_shape, col):\n    \"\"\"Finds the row where the piece would land.\"\"\"\n    board_height, board_width = board.shape\n    piece_height, piece_width = piece_shape.shape\n    piece_coords = np.array(np.where(piece_shape == '*')).T\n\n    # Adjust col to be 0-indexed\n    c0 = col -

With an empty board and an O-block, any placement on the bottom row is functionally similar for the first move. Placing the block flat is optimal.

The board becomes:\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ......*...\n        .****.***.\n        ...**.....\n        This leaves no holes, keeps the height at 3, but creates a somewhat bumpy surface.\n    *   Placing it at column 8 results in:\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        .......*..\n        .****..***\n        ...**.....\n        Also height 3, no holes, similar bumpiness.\n4.  **Rotation 270° (**, 0*, 0*):** This is also a tall rotation (height 3).\n    *   Placing it at column 9 (leftmost square at 9) results in the block landing with its bottom at row 7. The block (** at row 7, 0* at row 8, 0* at row 9) occupies (7,9), (7,10), (8,10), (9,10). The board becomes:\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..........\n        ..**....**\n        .****...*.\n        ...**...*.\n        This placement keeps the maximum height at 3 (relative to the bottom), creates no new holes, and maintains a relatively flat surface on the right side. The aggregate height is minimized compared to other good options, and the bumpiness is reasonable.\n\nComparing the best options (180° at 7\/8 and 270° at 9), the placement 270° at 9 seems marginally better due to lower overall height build-up and a flatter resulting surface profile. It doesn't clear any lines, but no placement does this round without creating significant problems.\n\nTherefore, the chosen action is to rotate the block 270° and drop it such that its leftmost column aligns with column 9.\n\nAnswer: 9 270","```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_occupied_coords(block_shape, rotation, top_left_r, top_left_c):\n    \"\"\"Gets absolute board coordinates occupied by the block.\"\"\"\n    coords = set()\n    shape = block_shape[rotation]\n    for r in range(len(shape)):\n        for c in range(len(shape[r])):\n            if shape[r][c] == '*':\n                coords.add((top_left_r + r, top_left_c + c))\n    return coords\n\ndef check_collision(board, block_coords):\n    \"\"\"Checks if block coordinates collide with board or boundaries.\"\"\"\n    max_r, max_c = board.shape\n    for r, c in block_coords:\n        if not (0 <= r < max_r and 0 <= c < max_c): # Check boundaries\n             # This check isn't strictly needed if we start high and only move down\/sideways within bounds\n            return True\n        if board[r, c] == '*': # Check collision with existing blocks\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef simulate_drop(board, block_shape, rotation, drop_c):\n    \"\"\"Simulates dropping the block and returns the final board state.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = board.shape\n    shape = block_shape[rotation]\n    block_height = len(shape)\n    block_width = len(shape[0]) if block_height > 0 else 0\n    \n    # Adjust drop_c to be 0-indexed\n    drop_c_idx = drop_c -

Both options result in the block settling at the same height. Option 3 fills columns 3 and 4, while option 4 fills columns 4 and 5. Both are reasonable choices. Let's choose coordinate 3. Since all rotations are the same, 0° is fine.\n\n**Decision:** Place the O-block at coordinate 3 with 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 3 0","```\nAnswer: 3 0\n```","Based on the analysis of the board state and the current block's rotations, the goal is to place the block in a position that minimizes holes, reduces stack height, and preferably clears lines or sets up future line clears.\n\n**Board State:**\nThe board has a significant height difference, with columns 2-4 being quite high and columns 1, 8, 9, 10 being lower. There are several gaps and potential holes.\n\n**Current Block (L-shape):**\nWe need to evaluate the four possible rotations.\n\n1.  **0° Rotation:** `*..` \/ `***`\n    - Placing this block anywhere suitable would likely increase the height significantly or create difficult overhangs due to its shape and the current board state.\n2.  **90° Rotation:** `**` \/ `*.` \/ `*.`\n    - Placing this at column 9 (`Answer: 9 90`) would fill the right side somewhat, landing on rows 6, 7, and 8. It fills columns 9 and 10 but leaves a hole in column 8 at row 8.\n3.  **180° Rotation:** `***` \/ `..*`\n    - Placing this at column 1 (`Answer: 1 180`) would fill the gap on the left side, landing on rows 7 and 8. However, it creates a deep hole at (8, 2) and maintains a large height difference across the board.\n    - Placing this at column 8 (`Answer: 8 180`) looks very promising. The block `***` would land on row 5, columns 8, 9, 10. The block `..*` would land on row 6, column 10.\n        - Let's visualize the result for 8 180:\n          ..........\n          ..**.*****\n          ...**...**\n          ..**..****\n          ..**....**\n          ..***..***  <- Block `***` lands here\n          ..*.....***  <- Block `..*` lands here\n          ..**....**\n          .****....*\n          ...**....*\n        - This placement significantly flattens the top surface across columns 6-10 and reduces the maximum height, making it an excellent choice.\n4.  **270° Rotation:** `.*` \/ `.*` \/ `**`\n    - Placing this at column 1 (`Answer: 1 270`) fills the left gap somewhat but creates unevenness.\n    - Placing this at column 9 (`Answer: 9 270`) fills the right side similar to the 90° rotation but mirrored.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nComparing the outcomes, placing the block rotated 180° at column 8 (Drop Coordinate 8) provides the best result. It significantly improves the board state by leveling the surface and reducing the height disparity without creating new significant holes.\n\nAnswer: 8 180"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Surface `....*.....` is slightly less flat than option 1.\n\n**Decision:**\nComparing option 1 (0°, Drop 4) and option 2 (90°, Drop 5):\n- Both result in a height of 3 (rows 8, 9, 10 occupied).\n- Option 1 creates a flatter top surface (`....**....`), which is generally preferred for future placements.\n- Option 2 fills row 10 better but leaves a less flat surface (`....*.....` on top of `...*.*.*..`).\n\nI choose Option 1 (0°, Drop 4) for its flatter surface.\n\n**Action:**\n- Drop Coordinate: 4\n- Rotation Angle: 0\n\nAnswer: 4 0","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to find the best placement.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Board:**\n    The board has existing blocks primarily in the middle columns (3 to 7), with the highest point at row 6 (columns 5, 6) and some blocks lower down. There's a significant gap under the block at (3,7) and (4,7). The lowest empty reachable spots are around column 5 and 6, above row 7.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Block:**\n    The current block is a 2x2 square (O-piece). All rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) result in the same shape. Therefore, the rotation angle doesn't influence the final placement shape. We can choose 0°.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Possible Placements (using rotation 0°):**\n    *   **Drop 1, 2:** Lands at the bottom (row 10), far from other blocks. Bad.\n    *   **Drop 3 (cols 3, 4):** Lands on row 8, hitting the block at (4,9). Fills the gap below (3,7), creating `..***.....` \/ `..*****...`. Max height becomes 8.\n    *   **Drop 4 (cols 4, 5):** Lands on row 7, hitting the block at (4,8). Creates `..****....` \/ `..****....`. Max height becomes 7.\n    *   **Drop 5 (cols 5, 6):** Lands on row 6, hitting the blocks at (5,7) and (6,7). Creates `....****..` \/ `...*****..`. Max height becomes 6. This looks very stable and keeps the stack low.\n    *   **Drop 6 (cols 6, 7):** Lands on row 7, hitting the block at (7,9). Creates `....**....` \/ `...**.....` \/ `...*..**..` \/ `...****...`. Max height becomes 7, creates a hole. Bad.\n    *   **Drop 7, 8, 9:** Lands at the bottom (row 10), far from other blocks. Bad.\n\n4.  **Choose the Best Placement:**\n    Comparing the plausible drops (3, 4, 5, 6):\n    *   Drop 3: Height 8, fills gap well.\n    *   Drop 4: Height 7, slightly less stable surface.\n    *   Drop 5: Height 6, lowest profile, stable surface.\n    *   Drop 6: Height 7, creates a hole.\n\n    Drop 5 seems optimal as it results in the lowest maximum height (6) and maintains a relatively flat surface. Since rotation doesn't matter, 0° is a valid choice.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_block_coords(block_shape_str):\n    \"\"\"Converts the string representation of a block shape into coordinates.\"\"\"\n    lines = block_shape_str.strip().split('\\n')\n    coords = []\n    for r, line in enumerate(lines):\n        for c, char in enumerate(line):\n            if char == '*':\n                coords.append((r, c))\n    return coords, len(lines[0]), len(lines) # Return coords, width, height\n\ndef get_occupied_cells(coords, top_left_r, top_left_c):\n    \"\"\"Get absolute board coordinates for a block placement.\"\"\"\n    cells = set()\n    for r_offset, c_offset in coords:\n        cells.add((top_left_r + r_offset, top_left_c + c_offset))\n    return cells\n\ndef check_collision(board_array, occupied_cells):\n    \"\"\"Check if the occupied cells conflict with the board or boundaries.\"\"\"\n    board_height, board_width = board_array.shape\n    for r, c in occupied_cells:\n        if not (0 <= r < board_height and 0 <= c < board_width):\n            return True # Out of bounds (shouldn't happen with proper drop logic)\n        if board_array[r, c] == 1:\n            return True # Collision with existing block\n    return False\n\ndef find_landing_row(board_array, block_coords, block_width, block_left_col_idx):\n    \"\"\"Find the highest row index (lowest position) the block can land at.\"\"\"\n    board_height, board_width = board_array.shape\n    current_row = 0\n    while True:\n        next_row = current_row + 1\n        occupied_cells = get_occupied_cells(block_coords, next_row, block_left_col_idx)\n        # Check if any part of the block is below the board floor\n        max_r = -1\n        for r,c in occupied_cells:\n             max_r = max(max_r, r)\n        if max_r >= board_height:\n             break # Hit the floor\n\n        # Check collision\n        if check_collision(board_array, occupied_cells):\n            break # Collided with another block\n\n        current_row = next_row\n\n    return current_row # This is the final top_left_r for the block\n\ndef calculate_placement_score(board_array, block_coords, final_r, final_c):\n    \"\"\"Evaluates the quality of a placement.\"\"\"\n    temp_board = board_array.copy()\n    occupied_cells = get_occupied_cells(block_coords, final_r, final_c)\n    \n    # Check for topping out\n    for r, c in occupied_cells:\n        if r < 0: # Assuming board starts at row 0, negative index means above board\n             return -float('inf') # Invalid move (goes above top) - should be caught by landing logic if board size fixed\n\n    # Place block\n    for r, c in occupied_cells:\n        if 0 <= r < temp_board.shape[0] and 0 <= c < temp_board.shape[1]:\n            temp_board[r, c] = 1\n        else:\n             # This case should ideally not happen if drop logic is correct\n             return -float('inf') \n\n    # Calculate score based on cleared lines, height, holes, etc.\n    \n    # 1.

It keeps the maximum height low (6), avoids creating new immediate holes, and creates a very desirable flat platform on the right side, potentially leading to future line clears.\n\n**Chosen Action:**\n- Drop Coordinate: 8 (The leftmost part of the 3-wide block shape lands in column index 7)\n- Rotation Angle: 0°\n\nAnswer: 8 0","Okay, I will analyze the board and the falling block to determine the best move.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Board State:** The board has existing blocks concentrated mostly in the lower-left and center-right areas. There's a significant gap column 1 and several smaller gaps. The maximum height is 7 (column 3).\n2.  **Current Block:** The S-shaped block.\n    *   0°\/180° (0** \/ **0): Width 3, Height 2.\n    *   90°\/270° (*0 \/ ** \/ 0*): Width 2, Height 3.\n3.  **Goal:** Place the block to minimize height, fill gaps, avoid creating holes, and ideally clear lines (though none seem immediately possible).\n\n**Evaluation of Moves:**\n\n*   **Rotation 0°\/180° (0** \/ **0):**\n    *   Placing this horizontally often fits well in gaps.\n    *   Trying different drop coordinates:\n        *   Coord 2-6: Land high or create significant holes\/increase height substantially.\n        *   Coord 7: Lands with its bottom edge (**0) at row y=3 (occupying (7,3), (8,3)) and top edge (0**) at row y=4 (occupying (8,4), (9,4)). It rests on the block at (7,2).\n            *   Resulting board section:\n                ...\n                .*..**.**.. (4)\n                .**.****.. (3)\n                .****..... (2)\n            *   This fills the space above (7,2) and (8,2) relatively well. Max height remains 6 (at column 3). Creates holes at (1,3) and (6,3). Surface is okay.\n        *   Coord 8: Lands with its bottom edge (**0) at row y=3 (occupying (8,3), (9,3)) and top edge (0**) at row y=4 (occupying (9,4), (10,4)). It rests on the block at (9,2).\n            *   Resulting board section:\n                ...\n                .*..**...** (4)\n                .**.**.**.. (3)\n                .****..... (2)\n            *   This also fills a gap. Max height remains 6. Creates holes at (1,3) and (7,3). Surface is okay, maybe slightly worse than Coord 7 as it leaves a single column gap (col 7).\n\n*   **Rotation 90°\/270° (*0 \/ ** \/ 0*):**\n    *   Placing this vertically needs a 2-wide space.\n    *   Trying different drop coordinates:\n        *   Coord 1-3: Land very high or create bad holes.\n        *   Coord 4: Lands with its bottom edge (0*) at y=6. High placement.\n        *   Coord 6: Lands with its bottom edge (0*) at y=6. High placement.\n        *   Coord 7: Lands resting on (7,2), occupying (7,5), (7,4), (8,4), (8,3). Max height becomes 7 (at col 7). Creates multiple new holes\/complexities.\n        *   Coord 8: Lands resting on (9,2), occupying (8,5), (8,4), (9,4), (9,3). Max height becomes 7 (at col 8). Creates holes\/complexities.\n        *   Coord 9: Lands resting on (9,2), occupying (9,5), (9,4), (10,4), (10,3). Max height becomes 7 (at col 9). Creates holes\/complexities.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the best options (Rotation 0°, Coord 7 and Coord 8), both keep the max height at 6. Coord 7 seems slightly better as it fills row 3 more completely (.**.****..) and leaves a potentially easier-to-fill 2-wide gap on the right, compared to Coord 8's 1-wide gap.\n\nTherefore, the best move is Rotation 0° at Drop Coordinate 7.\n\nAnswer: 7 0","```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef parse_board(board_str):\n    lines = board_str.strip().split('\\n')\n    board = np.array([[1 if c == '*' else 0 for c in line] for line in lines])\n    return board\n\ndef parse_block_rotations(block_str):\n    rotations = {}\n    parts = block_str.strip().split('\\n\\n')\n    for part in parts:\n        lines = part.split('\\n')\n        angle = int(lines[0].replace('°:', ''))\n        shape_str = lines[1:]\n        shape = np.array([[1 if c == '*' else 0 for c in line] for line in shape_str])\n        # Find the coordinates relative to top-left\n        coords = []\n        for r in range(shape.shape[0]):\n            for c in range(shape.shape[1]):\n                if shape[r, c] == 1:\n                    coords.append((r, c))\n        rotations[angle] = {'shape': shape, 'coords': coords}\n    return rotations\n\ndef get_placement_height(board, block_coords, drop_col):\n    board_height, board_width = board.shape\n    max_row = -1\n    for r_offset, c_offset in block_coords:\n        col = drop_col + c_offset -

There's a hole at (Row 7, Col 1). Columns 3 through 10 are empty down to the bottom (row 9).\n\n**Current Block:** I-block\n```\n0°:  ****\n90°: *\n     *\n     *\n     *\n```\n(180° and 270° are equivalent to 0° and 90° respectively for placement).\n\n**Analysis of Possible Moves:**\n\n1.  **Rotation 0° (Horizontal):** `****` (Width 4, Height 1)\n    - Placing this horizontally anywhere from column 3 onwards (e.g., `3 0`) would land it on row 9.\n    - Example: `3 0` -> `..****..` on row 9.\n    ```\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    *.........\n    **........\n    .*........\n    **..****..\n    **........\n    ```\n    This creates a hole at (Row 9, Col 2) and leaves the hole at (Row 7, Col 1). The surface becomes uneven. Generally not a good placement.\n\n2.  **Rotation 90° (Vertical):** `*` (Width 1, Height 4)\n    - Placing this vertically means it will be 4 squares high.\n    - If dropped in any column from 3 to 10, it will land with its bottom on row 9, occupying rows 6, 7, 8, and 9 in that column.\n    - **Option A: Drop at 3 (`3 90`)**:\n      ```\n      ..........\n      ..........\n      ..........\n      ..........\n      ..........\n      *.........\n      **.*......\n      .*.*......\n      **.*......\n      **.*......\n      ```\n      This creates a single-column gap (a \"well\") in column 2, right next to the existing structure. While wells can be useful for clearing lines with future I-blocks, they can also be difficult to manage if the right piece doesn't come. It also doesn't address the hole at (7,1).\n    - **Option B: Drop at 10 (`10 90`)**:\n      ```\n      ..........\n      ..........\n      ..........\n      ..........\n      ..........\n      *........*\n      **.......*\n      .*.......*\n      **.......*\n      **.......*\n      ```\n      This places the block on the far right. It keeps the central area open, avoids creating immediate gaps or wells next to the main structure, and creates a relatively flat surface (height 5 on the left, height 5 on the right). This is generally considered a safer and more flexible move in Tetris.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nPlacing the block vertically (`90°`) is better than horizontally (`0°`). Between the vertical placements, placing it on the far right (`10 90`) avoids creating difficult-to-fill gaps or wells near the existing stack and maintains a more level playing field. This seems like the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: 10 90","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to find the best move.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Board:**\n    - The current board has blocks stacked mainly on the left side (up to row 5) and a single column on the far right (up to row 4).\n    - There's a notable gap at column 3, row 3.\n    - The highest point is row 5.\n    - No lines are close to being cleared.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Block:**\n    - The current block is an 'S' shape.\n    - It has two primary rotations (0°\/180° and 90°\/270°).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Potential Moves:**\n    - **Rotation 0° ( `**0`, `0**` ):**\n        - Placing it spanning columns 1-3 or 2-4 would conflict with the high stack on the left.\n        - Placing at column 3 (occupying columns 3, 4, 5):\n            - Shape: `..**.` (row y+1), `...**` (row y)\n            - It would land on top of the blocks at (4,2) and (5,2).

There's also a single block high up on the right at (10, 6).\n3.  **Current Block:** The current block is a Z-piece. It has two effective rotations (0°\/180° and 90°\/270°).\n    *   0°: `** \/ 0**` (width 3, height 2)\n    *   90°: `0* \/ ** \/ *0` (width 2, height 3)\n4.  **Evaluating Options:**\n    *   **Rotation 0°\/180°:** Placing this piece horizontally will likely create holes or result in an uneven surface, especially given the existing structure. For example, dropping it near the left would leave gaps above row 1\/2. Dropping it further right might bridge over existing gaps badly or stack high on the right side. Placing it at column 8 lands high (bottom at row 7) creating a tall stack on the right.\n    *   **Rotation 90°\/270°:** Placing this piece vertically seems more promising.\n        *   Dropping at **coordinate 1**: The block shape is `* \/ ** \/ *`. It would occupy columns 1 and 2. It will fall until the lowest piece `*` at (column 1, relative row 0) rests on the `*` at (board column 1, row 2), and the piece `**` at (column 2, relative row 1) rests on the `*` at (board column 2, row 3). The piece at (column 2, relative row 1) hitting the block at (2, 3) is the limiting factor, making the piece land at row 4. Thus, the block's lowest point (relative row 0) lands at board row 3. The pieces will occupy (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5). This perfectly fills the gap on the left side. The resulting board state is relatively flat and avoids creating new holes.\n        *   Dropping at other coordinates (e.g., coordinate 9): This would place the block high up on the right side (bottom at row 7), exacerbating the height difference across the board.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The best move is to rotate the block 90° and drop it at coordinate 1. This fills the low area on the left effectively.\n\n**Action:**\nDrop Coordinate: 1\nRotation Angle: 90\n\nAnswer: 1 90","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to find the best placement.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Board:**\n    The board has blocks concentrated on the left and right edges, with a significant gap in the middle columns (5, 6, 7). The highest points are columns 3, 4, 5 (rows 9 or 10), and the stack on the right (columns 8, 9, 10) reaches up to row 5\/6. There's a notable overhang at (2,3) and (1,4)\/(2,4).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Block:**\n    The block is an 'S' shape.\n    - 0°\/180°: `**`\/`0**` or `0**`\/`**0`. It's 3 wide and 2 high.\n    - 90°\/270°: `0*`\/`**`\/`*0` or `*0`\/`**`\/`0*`. It's 2 wide and 3 high.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Potential Placements:**\n    The main goal is to keep the board relatively flat, avoid creating holes, and potentially clear lines or set up future clears.\n\n    *   **Rotation 0°\/180°:** This orientation is 3 wide. Placing it usually requires a flat surface of width 3 or creates overhangs\/holes.\n        - Placing it in the middle gap (e.g., drop column 5 or 6) would land very low and leave large gaps above.\n        - Placing it on the left (e.g., drop column 1 or 2) would increase the height significantly on that side.\n        - Placing it towards the right (e.g., drop column 7) lands at row 4 (`y=4` based on previous thought process), creating `(7,4), (8,4), (8,5), (9,5)`. This creates a hole at (7,5) under the piece. This is undesirable.\n\n    *   **Rotation 90°\/270°:** This orientation is 2 wide and 3 high. It's better suited for filling gaps or slots.\n        - Placing it in the far right (drop column 9) seems promising. Let's re-verify the landing position from the thought process:\n            - Drop 9, Rotation 90°. Block columns: 9, 10. Shape: `0*`\/`**`\/`*0`.\n            - Column heights: h(9)=6, h(10)=5.\n            - The block will fall until its lowest point `(9, y+2)` is just above the stack at column 9 (row 6), or its point `(10, y+1)` is just above the stack at column 10 (row 5). The constraint from column 10 is tighter. The piece `(10, y+1)` must be above row 5. This happens when `y+1 < 5`, so `y < 4`. The piece `(10, y+1)` at `y=3` would be at `(10, 4)`, which is empty. The piece `(10, y+1)` at `y=4` would be at `(10, 5)`, which is occupied. So collision happens trying to move to `y=4`. The block rests at `y=3`.\n            - Final position: The block occupies squares (10,3), (9,4), (10,4), (9,5).\n            - Resulting Board:\n               ..........\n               ..........\n               .........*\n               ........**\n               *.......*.*\n               *.......**\n               **......**\n               .*.......*\n               ****.....*\n               **.**....*\n            - Evaluation: This placement fills the gap next to the stack at (10,5) and builds up the right side smoothly. It doesn't create any immediate holes. The surface profile is relatively manageable.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Placing the block rotated 90 degrees at column 9 seems to be the most strategically sound move. It avoids creating holes and maintains a relatively level surface on the right side.\n\nAnswer: 9 90","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to find the best placement.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Board State:** The board has existing blocks primarily on the left and right sides, with significant gaps and uneven terrain. The highest occupied row is 8.\n2.  **Current Block:** The 'S' shape block.\n    *   0°\/180°: `**0 \/ 0**` (Width 3, Height 2)\n    *   90°\/270°: `0* \/ ** \/ *0` (Width 2, Height 3)\n3.  **Goal:** Find a placement that minimizes height increase, avoids creating new holes (especially enclosed ones), and ideally sets up future line clears or maintains a manageable surface.\n\n**Evaluating Options:**\n\n*   **Rotation 0° \/ 180° (`**0 \/ 0**`)**\n    *   Placing this generally requires 3 columns wide. Trying various positions reveals that placing it low often results in landing on rows 4 or 5, increasing the maximum height to 8 and creating single-block holes.\n        *   Drop at col 3: Lands on (3,5),(4,5)\/(4,4),(5,4). Creates hole at (6,4). Height=8.\n        *   Drop at col 4: Lands on (4,5),(5,5)\/(5,4),(6,4). Creates hole at (4,4). Height=8.\n        *   Drop at col 5: Lands on (5,5),(6,5)\/(6,4),(7,4). Creates hole at (5,4). Height=8.\n        *   Drop at col 6: Lands on (6,5),(7,5)\/(7,4),(8,4). Creates hole at (6,4). Height=8.\n        *   Other placements land higher or create worse structures.\n\n*   **Rotation 90° \/ 270° (`0* \/ ** \/ *0`)**\n    *   Placing this generally requires 2 columns wide and is 3 rows tall.\n        *   Drop at col 7: Lands on (8,7), (7,6),(8,6), (7,5). This fits into the structure on the right side. It doesn't create immediate enclosed holes, but it increases the height to 8 and leaves a very uneven surface, potentially creating difficult gaps later.\n        *   Other placements tend to create holes or land awkwardly, increasing height significantly. For example, col 8 lands at height 9, col 9 lands at height 9.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nBoth orientations lead to suboptimal results, increasing the height to at least 8.\n*   Options like `4 0` create a single, low hole but maintain a relatively contained structure height increase.\n*   Option `7 90` avoids an immediate enclosed hole but creates a very jagged surface on the right, increasing height to 8, which might be harder to manage later.\n\nCreating a single hole low down (like with `4 0`) is often considered slightly less damaging than creating severe surface unevenness and potential overhangs (like with `7 90`). Therefore, placing the block at column 4 with 0° rotation seems like the least bad move.\n\n**Chosen Action:**\nDrop Coordinate: 4\nRotation Angle: 0\n\nAnswer: 4 0","Okay, I understand the rules and the task. I will analyze the board and the current block to determine the best placement.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Board State:** The board has several uneven columns. There's a significant height difference, with columns 3-6 being quite high and columns 7-8 forming a deep well reaching the bottom. The far right (columns 9-10) and far left (columns 1-2) are also relatively low.\n2.  **Current Block:** The current block is a 2x2 square (O-piece). All rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) result in the same shape.\n3.  **Goal:** The primary goal is to place the block to level the board surface, avoid creating holes, and ideally set up line clears. Since the score is 0 and it's early (Epoch 10), survival and board stability are key.\n4.  **Options Evaluation:**\n    *   Placing the block on the left side (columns 1-2) would fill some low spots but potentially create overhangs or leave single-column gaps.\n    *   Placing the block in the middle (columns 3-6) would increase the height of the already highest section, which is generally undesirable.\n    *   Placing the block on the right side (columns 9-10) would increase height on the edge.\n    *   Placing the block in the deep well (columns 7-8) seems optimal. It fills the lowest part of the board directly on the bottom row (row 9). This helps level the surface significantly without creating new holes or overhangs.\n\n5.  **Chosen Move:** Placing the 2x2 block with its leftmost column at coordinate 7. It will fall to the bottom, occupying squares (7,8), (8,8), (7,9), and (8,9). Since all rotations are identical, 0° is a valid choice.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n- Drop Coordinate: 7\n- Rotation Angle: 0\n\nAnswer: 7 0","```\n180 1\n```\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Goal:** Place the current L-block to clear lines if possible, minimize board height, avoid creating holes, and create a flat surface for future blocks.\n2.  **Current State:** The board has a significant height difference, with columns 1-2 and 7-10 being much higher than columns 3-6. The lowest point is at column 3, row 3.\n3.  **Block Rotations & Potential Fits:**\n    *   **0° ( *00 \/ *** ):** Can fit in the lower middle section (cols 3-6), landing on row 3. However, it tends to leave single-width gaps or holes depending on placement. Height 5.\n    *   **90° ( ** \/ *0 \/ *0 ):** Generally lands higher (row 3 or 4) due to its height. Might fit well in columns 3-6, but results in a higher stack (Height 6 or more).\n    *   **180° ( *** \/ 00* ):** Can fit snugly in the lower-left corner (col 1) or middle section (cols 3-5), landing on row 3. Placing it at column 1 fills the lowest area neatly. Height 5.\n    *   **270° ( 0* \/ 0* \/ ** ):** Similar to 90°, lands higher (row 3 or 4) and results in a higher stack (Height 6 or more).\n4.  **Evaluation:**\n    *   Placing the block flat (0° or 180°) seems preferable to fill the low area.\n    *   Comparing 0° and 180° placements landing on row 3 (Height 5):\n        *   0° placements (cols 3-6) tend to leave awkward gaps or single holes.\n        *   180° placement at column 1 (`1 180`) fits perfectly against the left side and fills the lowest point (col 1, row 3) and adjacent squares (2,3) and the square above (3,3). It results in a relatively flat surface on the left at height 5.\n        *   180° placements at columns 3, 4, 5 also land at height 5 but don't fill the absolute lowest point as effectively as the column 1 placement.\n5.  **Decision:** The placement `1 180` seems optimal. It utilizes the lowest available space on the board, fills it compactly without creating new holes, and results in the minimum possible height increase (landing at height 5).\n\n**Simulated Board after placing 1 180:**\nBlock (180°):\n***\n00*\nLanding at column 1, row 3 (bottom of the block):\n..........\n..........\n.*.......*\n**......**\n*.......**\n*.......**\n***.....**  (Block row 1)\n*.*..*....*  (Block row 2 at (3,3))\n********.*\n**.**.**.*\n\nThis placement is stable and fills the low left area well.\n\nAnswer: 1 180","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current piece to determine the best move.\n\n**Board Analysis:**\nThe board has significant height differences, especially a deep well in column 9 and some gaps in columns 7, 8, and 10. The highest point is column 3 and 6\/7 at row 9. The lowest points are columns 9 and 10. Clearing lines soon is unlikely without filling the lower gaps first.\n\n**Current Block:**\nThe current block is an I-piece (straight line of 4).\n- 0°\/180°: **** (Width 4, Height 1)\n- 90°\/270°: * (Width 1, Height 4)\n                 *\n                 *\n                 *\n\n**Possible Moves Evaluation:**\n\n1.  **Rotation 0° (****):**\n    - Placing it horizontally requires a width of 4.\n    - Placing it low (e.g., columns 7-10) would land on row 7, leaving a significant gap underneath in columns 9 and 10. This is generally undesirable.\n    - Placing it higher is not possible without hitting existing blocks prematurely.\n\n2.  **Rotation 90° (* vertical):**\n    - Placing it vertically requires a width of 1 and a height of 4.\n    - **Column 1:** Lands on row 2. Fills the gap, relatively flat surface.\n    - **Column 2:** Lands on row 2. Fills the gap, relatively flat surface.\n    - **Column 8:** Lands on row 3. Fills a gap.\n    - **Column 9:** Lands on row 5. This perfectly fills the deep 4-high gap in column 9.\n        - Landing position: (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8).\n        - Resulting board snippet:\n          ...**\n          ...**\n          ...**\n          ...**\n          ...**\n          .**.*\n          ***.*\n          *.**.*\n        - This significantly levels the right side of the board, creating a large flat area.\n    - **Column 10:** Lands on row 3. Fills the gap in column 10.\n\n**Decision:**\nPlacing the I-piece vertically (90° or 270°) in column 9 is the optimal move. It fills the deepest gap on the board (4 units high) precisely, significantly reducing the height difference and creating a much flatter surface on the right side, which is advantageous for future placements.\n\n**Action:**\n- Drop Coordinate: 9 (leftmost coordinate of the 1-wide block)\n- Rotation Angle: 90°\n\nAnswer: 9 90"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

However, it leaves the single '*' block part on row 4, creating a height of 4 and a somewhat uneven surface above the existing `....***...` structure on row 2. Example: Drop 2 (Leftmost at col 2) clears row 1, resulting board height 4.\n\n2.  **Rotation 90° (*0 \/ ** \/ *0):** This vertical shape doesn't fit well. Placing it anywhere creates significant height or awkward gaps. For instance, dropping at column 4 would land it high up due to the existing blocks on row 2.\n\n3.  **Rotation 180° (*** \/ 0*0):**\n    - Let's try placing this to fill the gap above the `***` on row 2. The block shape is 3 wide, 2 high. The gap is above columns 5, 6, 7.\n    - If we drop at column 5 (leftmost square at col 5), the block shape is:\n      ```\n      .....***.. (Block row 0 -> Board row R)\n      ......*... (Block row 1 -> Board row R+1)\n      ```\n    - The block falls. The squares (5,R), (6,R), (7,R) will attempt to land on row 2. These positions (5,2), (6,2), (7,2) are occupied. The block square (6, R+1) will attempt to land on row 3, position (6,3) which is empty, with (6,2) below it occupied.\n    - The lowest points that collide are (5,R), (6,R), (7,R) hitting row 2 (when R=2), and (6,R+1) hitting row 3 (when R+1=3 => R=2).\n    - The block stops when R=2 (its top row is board row 2).\n    - Final position of block squares: (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), (6,3).\n    - The board becomes:\n      ```\n      ..........\n      ..........\n      ..........\n      ..........\n      ..........\n      ..........\n      ..........\n      .....*.... (Row 3)\n      ....***... (Row 2 - existing blocks overwritten\/joined)\n      *********. (Row 1)\n      ```\n    - Result: No lines cleared. The stack height becomes 3. The placement fills the area above the existing structure smoothly.\n\n4.  **Rotation 270° (0* \/ ** \/ 0*):** Similar to 90°, this vertical shape is awkward. Placing it on the far right (Drop 9) looked promising initially, but careful simulation showed it lands awkwardly without clearing a line, resulting in height 4.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nComparing the best options:\n- Rot 0°, Drop 2\/3\/4: Clears 1 line (Score +1), Height 4, uneven surface.\n- Rot 180°, Drop 5: Clears 0 lines (Score 0), Height 3, smoother surface filling a key gap.\n\nAlthough clearing a line is usually good, the placement with 180° rotation at column 5 results in a lower stack height (3 vs 4) and a much more manageable board structure for future pieces. It fills the space directly above the only existing structure higher than row 1. This seems strategically superior in the long run.\n\nTherefore, the chosen action is Drop Coordinate 5, Rotation Angle 180.\n\nAnswer: 5 180","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to find the best placement.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Board:**\n    *   The board has existing blocks forming a base up to row 4 in the middle.\n    *   The bottom row (row 1) is almost full, with only column 10 empty (*********. ).\n    *   There are some internal holes, notably at (6, 3).\n    *   The highest stack is at row 4 (columns 5, 6, 7).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Block (T-shape) and Rotations:**\n    *   0°: Standard T shape.\n    *   90°: T rotated right.\n    *   180°: Inverted T.\n    *   270°: T rotated left.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Potential Moves:**\n    *   The most immediate opportunity is to clear the bottom row by filling the gap at column 10.\n    *   Let's see which rotation and position can achieve this while maintaining a good board state.\n\n    *   **Rotation 0° (0*0 \/ ***):**\n        *   If dropped at coordinate 8 (leftmost square at column 8), the block spans columns 8, 9, 10.\n        *   The bottom row `***` would land on row 1. Block parts would occupy (8,1), (9,1), (10,1). This fills the gap at (10,1) and completes row 1.\n        *   The top part `0*0` would land on row 2, occupying (9,2).\n        *   Board state after placement and line clear: The filled row 1 disappears, score increases by 1. The block piece at (9,2) remains. The overall height increases slightly, but a line is cleared, and the surface remains relatively manageable.\n\n    *   **Rotation 180° (*** \/ 0*0):**\n        *   If dropped at coordinate 8 (leftmost square at column 8), the block spans columns 8, 9, 10.\n        *   The bottom row `0*0` would land on row 2, occupying (9,2).\n        *   The top row `***` would land on row 3, occupying (8,3), (9,3), (10,3). This placement doesn't directly fill the gap at (10,1). Wait, I need to re-evaluate how the block falls. Let's re-evaluate the landing position for 180° at 8.\n        *   Block: *** \/ 0*0. Drop at 8. Spans 8, 9, 10.\n        *   Check columns: Col 8 hits block at (8,2), would land bottom at row 3. Col 9 hits block at (9,1), would land bottom at row 2. Col 10 hits bottom, would land bottom at row 1.\n        *   The block lands with its lowest part (the middle '*' in 0*0) at row 2, because column 9 hits the block at (9,1). The block occupies (8,3), (9,3), (10,3) and (9,2). This does not fill the gap at (10,1). My previous analysis for 180° was incorrect.\n\n    *   Let's re-evaluate 0° at 8 again carefully.\n        *   Block: 0*0 \/ ***. Drop at 8. Spans 8, 9, 10.\n        *   Check columns: Col 8 hits block at (8,2), would land bottom at row 3. Col 9 hits block at (9,1), would land bottom at row 2. Col 10 hits bottom, would land bottom at row 1.\n        *   The block rests when its lowest part makes contact. The '*' at column 10 in the `***` part hits the bottom (row 0) first. So the block lands with its bottom row (***) on row 1.\n        *   Coordinates: (8,1), (9,1), (10,1) and (9,2).\n        *   This fills the gap at (10,1) and completes row 1. This seems correct.\n\n    *   **Other rotations\/positions:** Other placements might fit well, but clearing the bottom line is generally a high priority, especially when it can be done cleanly like this. Placing the T-block (0°) at column 8 seems optimal as it clears a line and leaves a reasonable surface.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The best move is to use the 0° rotation and drop the block at coordinate 8. This clears the bottom line.\n\nAnswer: 8 0","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to find the best move.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Board State:** The board has gaps primarily on the left side (columns 1-3) and a single column gap on the right (column 9). The highest points are columns 5-7 in row 6.\n2.  **Current Block:** It's an L-shape.\n3.  **Goal:** Place the block to minimize height, avoid creating holes, and potentially set up line clears. Filling the gap on the right seems like a good immediate objective.\n\n**Evaluating Options:**\n\n*   **Rotation 0° ( \\*00 \/ \\*** ):** Placing this would require careful positioning to avoid creating holes. Placing it at coordinate 4 lands reasonably well but doesn't fill the rightmost gap.\n*   **Rotation 90° ( \\*\\* \/ \\*0 \/ \\*0 ):** This rotation fits perfectly into the gap in column 9. Dropping at coordinate 9 would place the block as:\n    ```\n    ........**\n    ....***.*.\n    .....*.*..\n    ....******\n    *********.\n    ```\n    This lands relatively low (top at row 5), fills the gap, and leaves a fairly level surface.\n*   **Rotation 180° ( \\*** \/ 00\\* ):** Placing this usually creates overhangs or requires specific gaps. Placing it at coordinate 7 seems okay but leaves the column 9 gap open.\n*   **Rotation 270° ( 0\\* \/ 0\\* \/ \\*\\* ):** This can also fit into the column 9 gap. Dropping at coordinate 9 would place the block as:\n    ```\n    .........*\n    ....***..*\n    .....*.***\n    ....******\n    *********.\n    ```\n    This also lands low (top at row 5) and fills the gap.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nBoth 90° at coordinate 9 and 270° at coordinate 9 are good moves. They fill the rightmost gap and keep the stack low and relatively flat. Comparing the resulting surfaces, the 90° rotation leaves a slightly flatter top (`........**` vs `.........*`).

It fills the bottom-left corner without significantly increasing the maximum height or creating awkward holes compared to other options. Although it doesn't clear a line, it prepares the board reasonably well.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to determine the best move.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Board State:** The board has several filled rows near the bottom, with some gaps. Row 9 is nearly full (missing column 9). Row 8 has several gaps. Rows 4 and 5 have solid blocks on the right.\n2.  **Current Block:** The block is a 2x2 square (O-block). All rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) result in the same shape.\n3.  **Goal:** Place the block to clear lines if possible, or otherwise place it in a stable position that avoids creating holes and keeps the stack height low.\n4.  **Placement Options:**\n    *   **Columns 1-3:** Placing the block at coordinates 1, 2, or 3 will land it on the bottom row (Row 9), resting with its bottom edge on Row 9 and top edge on Row 8. Placing it at coordinate 1 fills the leftmost gap at the lowest level.\n    *   **Columns 4-6:** Placing the block here will land it higher up, resting on the blocks in Row 7 or 8. This creates a higher stack compared to placing it on the left.\n    *   **Columns 7-9:** Placing the block here will land it significantly higher, resting on the blocks in Row 4, 5, or 6. This is generally undesirable as it increases stack height considerably.\n5.  **Optimal Move:** Placing the block in the leftmost available position (coordinate 1) seems best. It lands at the lowest possible height (bottom on Row 9, top on Row 8), fills a gap on the left side, and doesn't create immediate holes or significantly increase the stack height unevenly. Since all rotations are the same, 0° is a valid choice.\n\n**Simulation (Drop Coordinate 1, Rotation 0):**\nThe 2x2 block's leftmost column aligns with board column 1.\nIt falls until its bottom edge rests on the blocks at (1, 9) and (2, 9).\nThe block occupies squares (1,8), (2,8), (1,9), (2,9).\nThe board becomes:\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n.......***\n.......***\n........*.\n....***.*.\n**...*..*.\n*********.\nNo lines are cleared, but this maintains a relatively flat surface on the left at the lowest level.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to determine the best move.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Board State:** The current board has blocks concentrated towards the bottom, with a full row at the very bottom (row 9). There's a significant structure on the right side reaching up to row 4, and a smaller structure on the left up to row 7. There's a gap between columns 2 and 5 above row 7.\n2.  **Current Block:** The current block is an O-block (2x2 square). Its shape is identical regardless of rotation (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°). Therefore, the rotation angle choice is arbitrary; I will use 0°.\n3.  **Goal:** The primary goal is to place the block to maintain a relatively flat surface, avoid creating holes, and potentially set up line clears. Since row 9 is already full, clearing it isn't immediately possible with this block.\n4.  **Evaluating Placements (Rotation 0°):**\n    *   Placing the block towards the left (columns 1-5) will result in it landing on top of the existing blocks at row 7 (landing height row 5).\n    *   Placing the block towards the right (columns 6-9) will result in it landing higher up due to the taller structure there.\n    *   **Coordinate 1 (Cols 1,2):** Lands at row 5. Leaves a gap at col 3.\n    *   **Coordinate 2 (Cols 2,3):** Lands at row 5. Leaves a gap at col 4.\n    *   **Coordinate 3 (Cols 3,4):** Lands at row 5. Perfectly fills the gap above the blocks at row 7\/8 between cols 2 and 5. This creates a flatter surface.\n    *   **Coordinate 4 (Cols 4,5):** Lands at row 5. Leaves a gap at col 3.\n    *   **Coordinate 5 (Cols 5,6):** Lands at row 5. Leaves gaps at cols 3, 4.\n    *   **Coordinate 6 (Cols 6,7):** Lands much higher, at row 2. This is undesirable.\n    *   **Coordinate 7 (Cols 7,8):** Lands much higher, at row 2. This is undesirable.\n    *   **Coordinate 8 (Cols 8,9):** Lands higher, at row 4.\n    *   **Coordinate 9 (Cols 9,10):** Lands at row 5. Leaves a gap at col 8.\n\n5.  **Optimal Move:** Placing the block at drop coordinate 3 fills the most significant gap at the lowest possible height for this block. This keeps the stack relatively level and avoids creating new holes or difficult terrain.\n\n**Decision:** Drop the block at coordinate 3 with 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 3 0","Okay, I will analyze the board and the falling block to determine the best move.\n\n**Game State:**\nEpoch: 11\nScore: 1\nBoard:\n10 ..........\n9 ..........\n8 ..........\n7 ..........\n6 .......***\n5 .......***\n4 ........*.\n3 *******.*.\n2 ****.*..*.\n1 *********.\n  1234567890\n\nCurrent Block (Z):\n0°:\n**0\n0**\n90°:\n0*\n**\n*0\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Goal:** Place the block to clear lines if possible, keep the stack low and flat, avoid creating holes, and fill existing holes if convenient.\n2.  **Board Structure:** The right side (columns 8-10) is significantly higher than the left.

The ground heights are H(4)=3, H(5)=2, H(6)=3. The block will fall until one of its parts rests on the stack. The controlling factor is (6,y-1) needing to be above H(6)=3, requiring y-1-1 >= 3, so y >= 5. The block lands with its top row at y=5.\n        *   Cells placed: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4).\n        *   Resulting board snippet:\n            ```\n            ...**..*** (Row 5)\n            ....**..*.

(Row 1)\n            ```\n        *   Evaluation: This placement fills the area above the lowest column (5), keeps the maximum height at 6, and creates a relatively flat surface `** \/ **` at height 5\/4. This looks like a strong move.\n\n*   **Rotation 90° (`0* \/ ** \/ *0`):**\n    *   Placing this block vertically might fit into some gaps.\n    *   **Drop at 1:** Leftmost square at column 1. Block cells (2,y), (1,y-1), (2,y-1), (1,y-2). Heights H(1)=3, H(2)=3. Controlling factor is (1,y-2) needing to be above H(1)=3, requiring y-2-1 >= 3, so y >= 6.

Compared to 0° Drop 4, it leads to a higher stack.\n    *   **Drop at 5:** Leftmost square at column 5. Block cells (6,y), (5,y-1), (6,y-1), (5,y-2). Heights H(5)=2, H(6)=3. Controlling factor is (6,y-1) needing y-1-1 >= 3 => y >= 5, and (5,y-2) needing y-2-1 >= 2 => y >= 5.

However, the surface created is less flat `* \/ ** \/ *` compared to 0° Drop 4.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe 0° rotation placed at column 4 seems optimal.

The goal is to place the T-shaped block to level the board and potentially set up line clears, without creating new holes or increasing the maximum height unnecessarily.\n\nLet's analyze the rotations and potential placements:\n\n1.  **0° Rotation (00*, ***):** Placing this flat side down on the main stack (e.g., drop coordinate 1 or 2) would place the single '*' block high up, creating a hole underneath. Placing it on the sides (e.g., drop 6) lands it low, which is okay but doesn't address the main stack imbalance.\n2.  **90° Rotation (*0, *0, **):**\n    *   Dropping at coordinate 1 places the block (`*` at col 1, rows 1-3; `*` at col 2, row 1) into the empty columns 1 and 2. It lands on the floor. This significantly fills the deep well on the left. The board profile becomes [3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This is a good move.\n    *   Dropping near the stack (e.g., coordinate 2, 3, 4) would land the block very high (at row 9), which is undesirable.\n    *   Dropping on the right (e.g., coordinate 6) lands low but doesn't fill the most critical area.\n3.  **180° Rotation (***, *00):** Placing this anywhere near the main stack lands it high (row 9). Placing it on the right (e.g., drop 6) lands low.\n4.  **270° Rotation (**, 0*, 0*):**\n    *   Dropping at coordinate 1 places the block (`*` at col 1, row 1; `*` at col 2, rows 1-3) into the empty columns 1 and 2. It lands on the floor. This also fills the deep well on the left, resulting in the same board state as the 90° rotation at coordinate 1. Profile: [3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This is also a good move.\n    *   Dropping near the stack lands the block high.\n    *   Dropping on the right lands low.\n\nComparing the best options, placing the block vertically into the left well (columns 1 and 2) is the most beneficial move. Both 90° and 270° rotations at drop coordinate 1 achieve this.

The highest occupied squares are mostly around row 6-8, except for column 9 reaching row 9.\n2.  **Current Block:** The 'S' block.\n    *   0° rotation (`**0 \/ 0**`) is 3 wide and 2 high.\n    *   90° rotation (`0* \/ ** \/ *0`) is 2 wide and 3 high.\n3.  **Goal:** Find a placement that avoids creating new holes, keeps the stack low, and maintains a relatively flat surface for future blocks. Clearing lines is a bonus but unlikely with this piece on this board.\n\n**Evaluating Placements:**\n\n*   **Rotation 0° (`**0 \/ 0**`):**\n    *   Placing this horizontally tends to create overhangs or holes given the current board structure. For example, placing it at column 2 (lands y=5) would create a hole at (2,6). Placing it further right (e.g., col 5, lands y=6) creates a hole at (5,7). All horizontal placements seem to create at least one new hole.\n\n*   **Rotation 90° (`0* \/ ** \/ *0`):**\n    *   This rotation is vertical and 3 units high.\n    *   `Column 1`: The block (`(2,y), (1,y+1), (2,y+1), (1,y+2)`) would fall until y=6. Final positions: (2,6), (1,7), (2,7), (1,8). This placement fits neatly against the existing blocks at `(2,8)` and `(1,8)`. It doesn't create immediate holes and results in a relatively flat top surface `[8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9]`. Bumpiness is low. Height is manageable.\n    *   `Column 2`: Lands y=5. Creates a deep well to the left (`[8, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9]`). Bad.\n    *   `Column 3`: Lands y=4. High stack, increases bumpiness (`[8, 8, 4, 4, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9]`).\n    *   `Column 4`: Lands y=4. High stack, increases bumpiness (`[8, 8, 6, 4, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9]`).\n    *   Columns 5, 6, 7, 8: All create new holes below the placed block. Bad.\n    *   `Column 9`: Lands y=7. Creates a high stack on the right (`[8, 8, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7]`).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the options, placing the block rotated 90° at column 1 (drop coordinate 1) appears to be the best move. It avoids creating holes, keeps the overall height relatively low, and results in the flattest surface profile among the viable options.\n\nAnswer: 1 90","```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef parse_board(board_str):\n    lines = board_str.strip().split('\\n')\n    board = np.array([[1 if c == '*' else 0 for c in line] for line in lines])\n    return board\n\ndef parse_block_rotations(block_str):\n    rotations = {}\n    parts = block_str.strip().split('\\n\\n')\n    for part in parts:\n        lines = part.split('\\n')\n        angle = int(lines[0].replace('°:', ''))\n        shape_str = lines[1:]\n        shape = np.array([[1 if c == '*' else 0 for c in row] for row in shape_str])\n        # Find the bounding box ignoring '0' padding rows\/cols if necessary\n        rows, cols = np.where(shape == 1)\n        if rows.size > 0:\n            min_r, max_r = np.min(rows), np.max(rows)\n            min_c, max_c = np.min(cols), np.max(cols)\n            trimmed_shape = shape[min_r:max_r+1, min_c:max_c+1]\n        else:\n             trimmed_shape = shape # Should not happen for valid blocks\n        rotations[angle] = trimmed_shape\n    return rotations\n\ndef check_collision(board, piece, x, y):\n    \"\"\"Check if piece collides with board at (x, y) top-left position.\"\"\"\n    piece_h, piece_w = piece.shape\n    board_h, board_w = board.shape\n    if x < 0 or x + piece_w > board_w or y + piece_h > board_h:\n        # Out of horizontal bounds or already exceeding bottom (should check y >= 0 implicitly)\n         return True # Treat going out of bounds horizontally as collision for simplicity here\n\n    for r in range(piece_h):\n        for c in range(piece_w):\n            if piece[r, c] == 1:\n                board_r, board_c = y + r, x + c\n                # Check vertical collision (hitting bottom or another piece)\n                if board_r >= board_h or board[board_r, board_c] == 1:\n                    return True\n    return False\n\ndef find_landing_row(board, piece, x):\n    \"\"\"Find the row where the piece lands given the starting column x.\"\"\"\n    board_h, _ = board.shape\n    piece_h, _ = piece.shape\n    y = 0\n    while True:\n        if check_collision(board, piece, x, y + 1):\n            return y\n        y += 1\n        # This safety break should technically not be needed if check_collision handles bottom boundary\n        if y + piece_h >= board_h:\n             return y\n\n\ndef place_piece(board, piece, x, y):\n    \"\"\"Place the piece onto the board at (x, y) and return the new board.\"\"\"\n    new_board = board.copy()\n    piece_h, piece_w = piece.shape\n    for r in range(piece_h):\n        for c in range(piece_w):\n            if piece[r, c] == 1:\n                new_board[y + r, x + c] = 1\n    return new_board\n\ndef clear_lines(board):\n    board_h, board_w = board.shape\n    new_board = np.zeros_like(board)\n    new_row_idx = board_h - 1\n    lines_cleared = 0\n    for r in range(board_h - 1, -1, -1):\n        if not np.all(board[r] == 1):\n            new_board[new_row_idx] = board[r]\n            new_row_idx -= 1\n        else:\n            lines_cleared += 1\n    return new_board, lines_cleared\n\ndef calculate_score(board):\n    \"\"\"Calculates a heuristic score for a given board state.\"\"\"\n    # Simple heuristic: Penalize height, holes, and bumpiness.

There's a deep 4-high gap in column 9. The highest occupied square is at row 5.\n2.  **Current Piece:** The I-piece (straight line).\n    *   Horizontal (0°\/180°): `****` (4 wide, 1 high)\n    *   Vertical (90°\/270°): `*` (1 wide, 4 high)\n                       `*`\n                       `*`\n                       `*`\n3.  **Goal:** Place the piece to clear lines if possible, otherwise, minimize height, avoid creating new holes, and try to create a flatter surface for future pieces.\n\n**Evaluating Options:**\n\n*   **Horizontal (0°):**\n    *   Placing it anywhere on the left\/middle section (columns 1-5) would land it high up (around row 4), leaving significant gaps below.\n    *   Placing it starting at column 6 or 7 would land it on row 7 (`*.***.****` or `*.****.***`). This doesn't clear lines and leaves the surface uneven.\n\n*   **Vertical (90°):**\n    *   Placing it in most columns would not be ideal. For example, column 1 lands on row 6, column 3 lands on row 8, column 6 lands on row 9.\n    *   Placing it in column 9 seems perfect. It fits exactly into the 4-high gap on the right side, landing on the block at row 7, column 9. This fills the gap completely without creating overhangs or new holes. The block will occupy (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7).\n    *   Placing it in column 10 would land on row 7, filling the gap next to the wall. This is also a good option but leaves column 9 as a deep hole. Filling column 9 directly seems slightly better for overall board structure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe best move is to rotate the piece vertically (90°) and drop it in column 9. This fills the deep gap perfectly.\n\n**Action:**\nDrop Coordinate: 9\nRotation Angle: 90\n\nAnswer: 9 90","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to find the best move.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Board State:** The board has varying heights. The highest points are in columns 8 and 9 (8 blocks high, reaching row 2). Columns 6 and 7 are empty down to row 8. The left side is somewhat filled.\n2.  **Current Block:** The current block is an I-piece (**** horizontally or a 4-block vertical line).\n3.  **Goal:** Place the block to minimize height, avoid creating holes, keep the board flat, and ideally set up line clears.\n\n**Evaluating Options:**\n\n*   **Horizontal Placement (0° or 180°):**\n    *   Placing it on the left side (columns 1-5) would significantly increase the height or create holes.\n    *   Placing it bridging columns 5 and 8 (e.g., Drop 5) would land high and create holes.\n    *   Placing it in columns 6-9 (Drop 6) would land on row 2, filling cells (6,2), (7,2), (8,2), (9,2). This creates a flat surface but leaves columns 6 and 7 very low. Resulting height profile: [4, 4, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4].\n    *   Placing it in columns 7-10 (Drop 7) would land on row 2, filling cells (7,2), (8,2), (9,2), (10,2). This also creates a flat surface on the right side. Resulting height profile: [4, 4, 3, 4, 3, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2]. This looks very promising for future line clears, creating a wide flat area at height 8.\n\n*   **Vertical Placement (90° or 270°):**\n    *   Placing it in columns 1-5 would create tall single columns.\n    *   Placing it in column 6 or 7 would land very low (row 9) and create significant holes.\n    *   Placing it in column 8 would land on row 3, filling cells (8,3) to (8,6). This fills the gap next to column 9 nicely. Resulting height profile: [4, 4, 3, 4, 3, 8, 8, 3, 2, 4].\n    *   Placing it in column 9 would land on row 3, filling cells (9,3) to (9,6). Similar to placing in column 8. Resulting height profile: [4, 4, 3, 4, 3, 8, 8, 2, 3, 4].\n    *   Placing it in column 10 would land on row 5, creating a tall column on the edge.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nComparing the best horizontal (Drop 7, 0°) and vertical (Drop 8 or 9, 90°) placements:\n*   Horizontal at Drop 7 (0°): Creates a wide flat top (columns 7-10) at height 8 (row 2). This is excellent for setting up future I-piece clears (Tetris). It leaves the gap at columns 6 and 7, but the flat top is a significant advantage.\n*   Vertical at Drop 8 or 9 (90°): Fills the immediate gap between columns 8 and 9, making the stack locally flatter, but doesn't create the wide platform the horizontal placement does.\n\nThe horizontal placement at Drop 7 with 0° rotation seems strategically better for long-term play and potential high scores via line clears.\n\n**Action:**\nDrop Coordinate: 7\nRotation Angle: 0°\n\nAnswer: 7 0","```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_board_height(board):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the height of the highest occupied cell.\"\"\"\n    for r in range(board.shape[0]):\n        if np.any(board[r] == '*'):\n            return board.shape[0] -

The horizontal placement fills the gap low down and keeps the overall height lower.\n\n```\nAnswer: 7 0\n```","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current block to find the optimal move.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Board:**\n    - The board is 10x10.\n    - The highest stack is in columns 7-10, reaching row 1.\n    - There are gaps in various places, notably a deep hole in column 9 starting at row 3, and several gaps in the middle columns (4-6) around rows 3-5.\n    - The left side (columns 1-3) is also relatively high.\n    - The lowest points are around columns 3-6 in rows 3-5.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Block (L-shape):**\n    - 0°: `*`,`***` (3x2)\n    - 90°: `**`,`* `,`* ` (2x3)\n    - 180°: `***`, ` *` (3x2)\n    - 270°: ` *`,` *`,`**` (2x3)\n\n3.  **Evaluate Potential Moves:** The primary goals are to keep the stack low, clear lines if possible (currently none immediately obvious), fill gaps, and create a flat surface for future blocks.\n\n    - **Rotation 0°:** Placing this generally results in landing high or creating overhangs due to its shape and the current board state. e.g., Drop 6 collides with Row 1.\n    - **Rotation 90°:**\n        - Drop 5: Lands with top at row 2. Fills gap above C5 R5 and C6 R3. Creates a relatively flat surface but leaves a 1-wide gap at C4.\n        - Drop 6: Lands with top at row 1. Fills gap above C6\/C7 R3 well, but lands higher than Drop 5.\n    - **Rotation 180°:**\n        - Drop 3: Lands with top at row 3. Fills gap above C5 R5. Reasonable placement.\n        - Drop 4, 5, 6: Land high (top at row 1).\n    - **Rotation 270°:**\n        - Drop 4: Lands with top at row 2. Fills gap above C4\/C5 R5. Surface is okay.\n        - Drop 5: Lands with top at row 1. Fills C5\/C6 gap above R3\/R5 vertically from R1-R3. Creates a good flat surface low down.\n\n4.  **Compare Best Options:**\n    - 90° at 5 (Top R2)\n    - 180° at 3 (Top R3)\n    - 270° at 4 (Top R2)\n    - 270° at 5 (Top R1)\n\n    Comparing these, 270° at 5 lands very low (starts at Row 1), fills a problematic gap area (columns 5 and 6, down to row 3), and creates a relatively flat surface from rows 1-3 in those columns. This seems like the most stable and beneficial placement.\n\n    Let's confirm the landing position for 270° at 5:\n    - Block shape: ` *`, ` *`, `**`\n    - Occupies columns 5 and 6.\n    - Column 5 obstacle at R5. Column 6 obstacle at R3.\n    - Block points: (6, h), (6, h+1), (5, h+2), (6, h+2).\n    - Check (6, h) vs R3 -> h <= 2.\n    - Check (6, h+1) vs R3 -> h+1 <= 2 -> h <= 1.\n    - Check (5, h+2) vs R5 -> h+2 <= 4 -> h <= 2.\n    - Check (6, h+2) vs R3 -> h+2 <= 2 -> h <= 0.\n    - The tightest constraint is h <= 0.

The board is currently empty (Epoch 1, Score 0), and the current block is a T-shape. My goal is to place this first block in an optimal position, which usually means creating a flat base near the center.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Block and Rotations:**\n    The T-block has four possible rotations:\n    *   0°: `0*0`, `***` (Width 3, Height 2)\n    *   90°: `*0`, `**`, `*0` (Width 2, Height 3)\n    *   180°: `***`, `0*0` (Width 3, Height 2)\n    *   270°: `0*`, `**`, `0*` (Width 2, Height 3)\n\n2.  **Evaluate Placement Options:**\n    Since the board is empty, the block will fall to the bottom row (Row 10). We want to keep the stack low and flat.\n    *   **Rotations 90° and 270°:** These are tall (Height 3) and would leave a less flat surface immediately. Not ideal for the first piece.\n    *   **Rotations 0° and 180°:** These are flat (Height 2) and seem better for starting.\n        *   **0° Rotation:** Shape `0*0`, `***`. If placed centrally, let's try `drop_coordinate = 4`. The leftmost part of the bounding box (column 0 relative) lands at board column 4. The block pieces occupy `(5, y+0), (4, y+1), (5, y+1), (6, y+1)`. Landing on the bottom means `y+1=10`, so `y=9`. Final positions: `(5, 9), (4, 10), (5, 10), (6, 10)`. Board state:\n            ```\n            ..........\n            ..........\n            ..........\n            ..........\n            ..........\n            ..........\n            ..........\n            ..........\n            ....*.....

This configuration has a bump (`*`) at `(5, 9)`.\n        *   **180° Rotation:** Shape `***`, `0*0`. If placed centrally, let's try `drop_coordinate = 4`. The leftmost part of the bounding box (column 0 relative) lands at board column 4. The block pieces occupy `(4, y+0), (5, y+0), (6, y+0), (5, y+1)`. Landing on the bottom means `y+1=10`, so `y=9`.

This configuration has a bump (`*`) at `(5, 10)`.\n\n3.  **Select the Best Move:**\n    Both 0° and 180° rotations placed at `drop_coordinate = 4` create a similar flat base of height 2. The 180° rotation places the single protruding block square (`*`) on the bottom row (row 10), while the 0° rotation places it on row 9. Placing the protrusion lower (180° rotation) is generally considered slightly better as it leaves a flatter top surface (`...***...` on row 9) which is easier to build upon.\n\n4.  **Format the Answer:**\n    The chosen action is rotation 180° and drop coordinate 4.\n    The required format is 'Answer: [drop_coordinate] [rotation_angle]'.\n\nAnswer: 4 180","Okay, I will analyze the board and the current S-block to determine the best placement.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Board State:** The current board has a small structure on rows 9 and 10: `...***....` on row 9 and `....*.....` on row 10. The rest of the board is empty.\n2.  **Current Block:** The S-block (`0**`\/`**0` or `*0`\/`**`\/`0*`).\n3.  **Goal:** Place the block to keep the board as flat as possible, minimize holes, and ideally set up future line clears. Avoid increasing height unnecessarily.\n\n**Evaluating Options:**\n\n*   **Rotation 0° \/ 180° (`0**`\/`**0`):**\n    *   Placing this horizontally often fits better with existing structures or creates flatter surfaces than the vertical orientation.\n    *   Dropping at column 1 or 2 would create holes under the block on row 10.\n    *   Dropping near the existing structure (columns 3-5) would land high or create significant overhangs\/holes.\n    *   Dropping to the right seems better.\n        *   Drop at 6: Lands with top at row 8. Creates `.....**...` (Row 8) and `...****...` (Row 9). Leaves column 5 slightly overhung.\n        *   Drop at 7: Lands with top at row 8. Creates `......**..` (Row 8) and `...***.*..` (Row 9). Leaves column 6 slightly overhung.\n        *   Drop at 8: Lands with top at row 9 (hits the bottom). Creates `...***..**` (Row 9) and `....*..**..` (Row 10). This keeps the height low and the surface relatively flat, leaving only a single empty space at (10, 7).\n\n*   **Rotation 90° \/ 270° (`*0`\/`**`\/`0*`):**\n    *   This vertical orientation tends to create holes or increase height significantly on the current board.\n    *   Dropping at column 3 would land with the top at row 7, creating holes at (9, 3).\n    *   Dropping at column 6 would land with the top at row 6, creating large gaps.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nPlacing the block with 0° rotation at drop coordinate 8 seems to be the most stable move.

It avoids creating immediate holes.\n\nComparison: Placement (4, 90°) seems superior as it fills an existing gap and results in a flatter, more stable board state for future pieces.\n\nAction: Place the block rotated 90 degrees, with its leftmost edge aligned with column 4.\n\nAnswer: 4 90\n```","Okay, I will analyze the board and the falling block to determine the best move.\n\nCurrent Board State:\nEpoch: 5\nScore: 0\nBoard:\n10 ..........\n 9 ..........\n 8 ..........\n 7 ....*.....\n 6 ...**.....\n 5 ...*......\n 4 ..***.....\n 3 ...*......\n 2 ...***..**\n 1 ....*..**.\n   1234567890\n\nCurrent Block: I-piece\n0°: ****\n90°:\n*\n*\n*\n*\n180°: ****\n270°:\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\nAnalysis:\nThe board has significant height variations. The goal is to place the I-piece to level the board, fill gaps, or set up line clears without creating new holes or excessively high stacks.\n\nOption 1: Horizontal placement (0° or 180°)\n- Placing horizontally generally creates overhangs or lands awkwardly on the uneven surface. For example, dropping at column 3 would land on row 5, leaving a gap at (3,4). Dropping at 7 would land on row 3.\n\nOption 2: Vertical placement (90° or 270°)\n- Dropping vertically seems more promising.\n- Dropping at column 1 or 2 lands low.\n- Dropping at column 3: The block will fall into the gap in column 3. The current height at column 3 is 4. The piece will land with its bottom square on row 5 and extend up to row 8. This fills the column well and levels the top surface with columns 4 and 5. Resulting heights: 0, 0, 8, 7, 7, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2. This looks like a strong move.\n- Dropping at column 4 or 5 would land on row 8, reaching row 11, which is too high.\n- Dropping at column 6: The height is 4. The piece would land on row 5 and reach row 8. Resulting heights: 0, 0, 4, 7, 7, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2. This also levels the board somewhat but leaves the gap in column 3.\n- Dropping at columns 7, 8, 9, or 10: The height is 2. The piece would land on row 3 and reach row 6. This builds up the right side.\n\nConclusion:\nPlacing the I-piece vertically at column 3 seems the best move. It fills an existing deep gap, utilizes the piece's length effectively, and creates a relatively flat top surface around columns 3, 4, and 5 at height 8, preparing for future pieces. Both 90° and 270° rotations result in the same vertical shape.

Drop 4 leaves a slightly lower profile towards the right ([...4, 0, 0...]) compared to Drop 5 ([...4, 4, 0...]), which might offer slightly more flexibility for future pieces. Therefore, Drop 4, Rot 0 is chosen.\n\n**Action:**\nDrop Coordinate: 4 (leftmost column of the 3-wide block)\nRotation: 0°\n\nAnswer: 4 0","Okay, I will analyze the possible moves and choose the best one.\n\n1.  **Analyze the board state:**\n    *   The board has several gaps and uneven heights.\n    *   There's a cavity on the left side, roughly columns 1-2, starting from row 7 down.\n    *   There are significant peaks around columns 3-6.\n    *   The right side (columns 8-9) also has blocks reaching row 8.\n\n2.  **Analyze the current block (Z-shape):**\n    *   0°\/180°: `**0 \/ 0**` (3 wide, 2 high)\n    *   90°\/270°: `0* \/ ** \/ *0` (2 wide, 3 high)\n\n3.  **Evaluate possible placements:**\n\n    *   **Rotation 0°\/180° (`** \/ 0**`)**:\n        *   Placing it horizontally often creates overhangs or requires flat surfaces.\n        *   Dropping at column 1: Lands low (row 8), creates a hole under the left part (`*` at board pos (1,9)).\n        *   Dropping at column 2: Lands on row 7, creates holes below.\n        *   Dropping at column 3: Lands high (row 1), fits the gap partially but leaves a hole at (2,2).\n        *   Other horizontal placements generally land high or create significant holes\/instability.\n\n    *   **Rotation 90°\/270° (`0* \/ ** \/ *0`)**:\n        *   This vertical orientation can fit into narrow gaps.\n        *   Dropping at column 1: The block `0* \/ ** \/ *0` will occupy columns 1 and 2. It drops down to row 7. The lowest point (`*` at relative (0,2)) lands at board coordinate (1,9). The other points land at (1,8), (2,8), (2,7).\n            *   Board state before (rows 7-9):\n                `...*......`\n                `...***..**`\n                `....*..**.`\n            *   Block lands:\n                `.. *......` (Piece at (2,7))\n                `.** ....**` (Pieces at (1,8), (2,8))\n                `*...*..**.` (Piece at (1,9))\n            *   Resulting board section (rows 7-9):\n                `.. *......`\n                `.** *...**`\n                `.*..*..**.`\n            *   This placement fills the left cavity nicely, reduces height difference on the left, and doesn't create immediate holes. Seems like a good option.\n        *   Dropping at column 2: Lands on row 6. Creates holes underneath.\n        *   Dropping further right generally leads to higher placements or creates significant gaps.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Placing the block rotated 90 degrees at column 1 seems to be the most advantageous move. It fills the deep gap on the left side and prepares a flatter surface for future blocks without creating immediate holes or significant height increases.\n\nAnswer: 1 90","Based on the game board and rules, the optimal strategy is to fill the gap on the left side of the board using the vertically oriented 'I' block.\n\n1.  **Analyze Rotations and Placements:**\n    *   **0° (****):** Placing this horizontally would create overhangs or leave gaps low on the board (e.g., placing at column 1, 2, or 3 lands on row 1; placing at 6 or 7 lands on row 4). None of these placements are ideal.\n    *   **90° (* \/ * \/ * \/ *):** This vertical orientation allows filling narrow gaps.\n        *   Placing at column 1: The block would fall until its bottom hits the block at (1,1). It would occupy squares (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5). This perfectly fills the deep gap on the left edge.\n        *   Placing at column 9: The block would fall until its bottom hits the block at (9,2). It would occupy squares (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), and (9,6). This fills the gap in column 9.\n        *   Placing at column 10: The block would fall until its bottom hits the block at (10,2). It would occupy squares (10,3), (10,4), (10,5), and (10,6). This fills the gap in column 10.\n\n2.  **Compare Options:**\n    *   Placing the vertical block in column 1 (1 90) fills the deepest available well (4 units high starting from row 2). This is generally a preferred strategy as it helps level the board and avoids leaving deep, single-width holes.\n    *   Placing in column 9 (9 90) or 10 (10 90) also fills wells but they are shallower.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The best move is to rotate the block 90 degrees and drop it in the leftmost column (column 1).\n\nAnswer: 1 90","Okay, I will analyze the board and the falling block to determine the best move.\n\n1.  **Analyze the board state:**\n    - The board has varying heights, with peaks at columns 3 and 4 (height 9).\n    - There's a significant gap\/hole at column 0, row 5.\n    - Other smaller gaps exist deeper in the stack.\n    - The current maximum height is 9 (row index 8).\n    - No lines are close to being completed.\n\n2.  **Analyze the block (S-shape) and rotations:**\n    - 0°\/180° (0** \/ **0): Width 3, Height 2.\n    - 90°\/270° (*0 \/ ** \/ 0*): Width 2, Height 3.\n\n3.  **Evaluate potential moves:**\n    - **Goal:** Keep the stack low, fill gaps if possible, avoid creating new holes, and maintain a relatively flat surface.\n\n    - **Rotation 0°\/180°:**\n        - Placing it in columns 3-5 (Drop 3) lands on row 7 (y=7). Max height becomes 9. Board: `..***.....` at y=8, `..****....` at y=7. Leaves the gap at (0,5).\n        - Placing it in columns 4-6 (Drop 4) lands on row 8 (y=8). Max height becomes 10. Board: `....**....` at y=9, `...****...` at y=8. Leaves the gap at (0,5). This increases height significantly.\n\n    - **Rotation 90°\/270°:**\n        - Placing it in columns 1-2 (Drop 1) lands with its bottom row at y=5.\n          - Block cells: (0,7), (0,6), (1,6), (1,5).\n          - Resulting board:\n            ..........\n            ...**.....\n            *.*.**....\n            ** *.*.....\n            * ****.....\n            *.**......\n            *.***.....\n            **.*......\n            **.***..**\n            *...*..**.\n          - This move fills the gap at (0,5). The maximum height remains 9 (row index 8). This seems like a very good move.\n        - Placing it in columns 5-6 (Drop 5) or 6-7 (Drop 6) would land high up (on row 8) and potentially reach the top boundary (height 10 required for the 3-high block). This is risky.\n\n4.  **Compare best options:**\n    - Drop 1, Rotation 90° (or 270°) seems optimal. It fills a crucial gap and keeps the maximum height from increasing. The resulting surface on the left isn't perfectly flat but is manageable.\n    - Drop 3, Rotation 0° (or 180°) is the next best, keeping the height at 9 but failing to fill the gap.\n\n5.  **Decision:** Choose Drop 1, Rotation 90°.\n\nAnswer: 1 90","```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef parse_board(board_str):\n    lines = board_str.strip().split('\\n')\n    rows = len(lines)\n    cols = len(lines[0])\n    board = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=int)\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if lines[rows -

Let's stick with 7 0.\n\n```\nAnswer: 7 0\n```","```\nMy goal is to place the T-shaped block to keep the board as flat as possible, avoid creating inaccessible holes, and potentially clear lines.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Board:**\n    The board has varying heights. There are gaps, notably around columns 6, 7, and 8, and a significant build-up on the right side (columns 9, 10). The lowest unoccupied rows are generally around row 0 or 1.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Block:**\n    The block is a T-shape. Its rotations offer different profiles:\n    *   0° and 180° are 3 wide, 2 high.\n    *   90° and 270° are 2 wide, 3 high.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Rotation 0° (0*0, ***):** Width 3. Placing this generally requires a flat 3-wide space. Placing it low might create overhangs or holes. E.g., dropping at 7 lands high (y=2) and creates a hole.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Rotation 90° (*0, **, *0):** Width 2, Height 3. This could fit into narrower gaps.\n    *   Drop at 7: Lands at y=0. Fills (7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (7,2). Fills the column 7 gap nicely. Result board max height 0. Surface: `2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 3, 4`.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Rotation 180° (***, 0*0):** Width 3.\n    *   Drop at 1: Lands at y=1. Fills (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (2,2). Flattens the left side. Result board max height 1. Surface: `0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4`.\n    *   Drop at 2: Lands at y=0. Fills (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (3,1). Flattens centre-left. Result board max height 0. Surface: `2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4`.\n    *   Drop at 8: Lands high (y=2) and creates holes. Not ideal.\n\n6.  **Evaluate Rotation 270° (0*, **, 0*):** Width 2, Height 3.\n    *   Drop at 7: Lands at y=0. Fills (8,0), (7,1), (8,1), (8,2). Fills the column 8 gap nicely. Result board max height 0. Surface: `2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 3, 4`.\n\n7.  **Compare Best Options:**\n    *   Drop 7, Rot 90°: Fills col 7 gap. Max height 0.\n    *   Drop 1, Rot 180°: Flattens left. Max height 1.\n    *   Drop 2, Rot 180°: Flattens centre-left. Max height 0.\n    *   Drop 7, Rot 270°: Fills col 8 gap. Max height 0.\n\n    Both Drop 7, Rot 90° and Drop 7, Rot 270° seem good as they fill vertical gaps without increasing the overall height significantly. Filling the slightly deeper gap in column 8 (using Rot 270°) seems marginally better than filling column 7 (using Rot 90°). Drop 2, Rot 180° is also a strong candidate, creating a very flat surface, but leaves the right side uneven. Drop 7, Rot 270 feels slightly more balanced for future placements.\n\n8.  **Final Decision:** Place the block rotated 270° with its leftmost coordinate at column 7. This lands the block pieces at (8,0), (7,1), (8,1), and (8,2).\n\n```\nAnswer: 7 270\n```","```\n[Thought Process]\n1.  **Analyze the Board:** The board is quite filled, especially the lower rows. The highest occupied squares are in row 1. There are several gaps and uneven surfaces. Key gaps are around columns 7, 8, 9 in the top rows.\n2.  **Analyze the Block:** The block is an S-shape.\n    *   0°\/180°: `0**`, `**0` (3 wide, 2 high)\n    *   90°\/270°: `*0`, `**`, `0*` (2 wide, 3 high)\n3.  **Evaluate 0°\/180° Rotations:**\n    *   Try to fit `0**`, `**0` across the top.\n    *   **Col 1-6:** These placements would land high or create immediate holes above existing blocks (e.g., Col 3 lands at row 0, Col 4 lands on row 2 creating a hole, Col 6 lands on row 1 creating a hole).\n    *   **Col 7:**\n        *   Shape: `......0**..`, `......**0..`\n        *   Drops until `**0` (bottom row of piece) hits row 1 (specifically, the '*' at (1,8)).\n        *   Landing position: The block occupies (0,8), (0,9), (1,7), (1,8).\n        *   Board Result (top rows):\n            ```\n            ...... **.\n            ......**..\n            ...**..*..\n            *.*.****..\n            ```\n        *   Assessment: Lands low (highest point at row 0). Fills the gap nicely at (0,8), (0,9). Leaves a 1-unit gap at (1,7) and (2,9). Relatively flat finish. Good option.\n    *   **Col 8:**\n        *   Shape: `.......0**..`, `.......**0..`\n        *   Drops until `**0` (bottom row) hits row 1 (specifically, the '*' at (1,10)).\n        *   Landing position: The block occupies (0,9), (0,10), (1,8), (1,9).\n        *   Board Result (top rows):\n            ```\n            ....... **\n            .......**..\n            ...**..*..\n            *.*.****..\n            ```\n        *   Assessment: Lands low (highest point at row 0). Leaves gaps at (1,7) and (1,10 is filled, error in thought, should be (1, 7) and below (0,8)). Less ideal fit than Col 7.\n4.  **Evaluate 90°\/270° Rotations:**\n    *   Try to fit `*0`, `**`, `0*` vertically.\n    *   **Col 1-8:** These tend to land awkwardly on the uneven surface or create significant holes.\n    *   **Col 9:**\n        *   Shape: `........*0`, `........**`, `........0*`\n        *   Drops until `0*` (bottom row) hits row 2 (specifically, the '*' at (2,10)).\n        *   Landing position: The block occupies (0,9), (1,9), (1,10), (2,10).\n        *   Board Result (top rows):\n            ```\n            ........*.\n            ........**.\n            .........*\n            *.*.****..\n            ```\n        *   Assessment: Lands higher (highest point at row 0, but base is row 2). Fills the right edge. Leaves gaps at (0,8) and (1,7), (1,8). Not as good as the Col 7, 0° placement due to higher landing and gaps.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The placement at column 7 with 0° rotation seems best. It keeps the stack low, fills a gap reasonably well, and avoids creating immediate deep holes or overhangs.\n\n```\nAnswer: 7 0"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
