The goal is to place the block such that it fits within the board's columns and falls to the bottom. \n\n### Current Block Analysis:\n- **0° and 180° rotations**: The block has a 2-row height and 3-column width. The occupied squares are (row 0, column 1), (row 0, column 2), (row 1, column 0), (row 1, column 1) relative to the top-left corner.\n- **90° and 270° rotations**: The block has a 3-row height and 2-column width. The occupied squares are (row 0, column 0), (row 1, column 0), (row 1, column 1), (row 2, column 1) relative to the top-left corner.\n\n### Board Constraints:\nThe board is 10 columns wide (1 to 10). For the 0°\/180° rotation (3 columns wide), valid drop coordinates range from 1 to 8 (since 1 + 3 - 1 = 3 ≤ 10, and 8 + 3 - 1 = 10). For the 90°\/270° rotation (2 columns wide), valid drop coordinates range from 1 to 9 (since 1 + 2 - 1 = 2 ≤ 10, and 9 + 2 - 1 = 10).\n\n### Placement Strategy:\nSince the board is empty, the block will fall to the bottom. A central placement is chosen for balance. For the 0° rotation (3 columns wide), a drop coordinate of 4 (columns 4, 5, 6) centers the block. This placement ensures the block fits within the board and lands at the bottom without overlapping.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands as low as possible and aligns with existing blocks to minimize gaps.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has blocks in row 9 (columns 5-6) and row 10 (columns 4-5). The rest of the rows are empty. The current block has two unique rotations:  \n- **0°\/180°**: 3 columns wide, with squares at (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3) (local coordinates).  \n- **90°\/270°**: 2 columns wide, with squares at (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1) (local coordinates).  \n\n### Key Observations:\n- The existing blocks form a diagonal pattern (row 10: columns 4-5; row 9: columns 5-6). Placing the block to connect these gaps will create a compact stack.  \n- The 0° rotation (3 columns wide) aligns well with the diagonal gaps (columns 4-6) and can land in row 7 without overlapping existing blocks.  \n\n### Simulation for 0° Rotation at Drop Coordinate 4:\n- **Block columns**: 4, 5, 6 (leftmost column 4).  \n- **Block positions**: (7,4), (7,5), (8,5), (8,6) (lowest possible row where no overlap occurs).  \n- This placement connects the existing blocks in row 9 (5-6) and row 10 (4-5), minimizing gaps.  \n\nAnswer: 4 0","\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal placement and rotation of the current Tetris block on the given game board. The goal is to place the block such that it lands without exceeding the board boundaries and sets up for potential future line clears. \n\n### Analysis of the Game Board and Block\nThe game board has 10 rows, with existing blocks in rows 7-10, forming a diamond-like pattern. The current block has four rotation states (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°), each with distinct shapes and widths. \n\n### Key Observations\n1. **Existing Blocks**: Rows 7-10 have blocks in columns 4-5 (rows 7 and 10) and columns 5-6 (rows 8 and 9). This creates gaps in columns 4 (rows 8-9) and 6 (rows 7-10).\n2. **Block Rotations**: \n   - **0° rotation**: 3 columns wide (shape: top row has a single block in column 1, bottom row has blocks in columns 1-3).\n   - **90° rotation**: 2 columns wide (shape: 3 rows high with blocks in column 1 of rows 1-3 and column 2 of row 1).\n   - **180° rotation**: 3 columns wide (shape: top row has blocks in columns 1-3, bottom row has a single block in column 3).\n   - **270° rotation**: 2 columns wide (shape: 3 rows high with blocks in column 2 of rows 1-2 and columns 1-2 of row 3).\n\n### Optimal Placement\nThe 0° rotation (3 columns wide) is chosen for its ability to fit into the existing structure. Placing it at drop coordinate 4 (leftmost column 4) covers columns 4-6. This position aligns with the gaps in the existing blocks and ensures the block lands on row 6 (bottom row of the block), as the next row (row 7) contains existing blocks in columns 4-5, preventing further descent.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe optimal action is to place the 0°-rotated block at drop coordinate 4.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands stably without exceeding the top boundary and ideally sets up for future line clears.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 columns (1-10) and 10 rows (top to bottom, 0-9). Existing blocks are concentrated in columns 3-5 (0-based 3-5) from row 4 downward. Key columns and their highest occupied rows:\n- Columns 0-2, 6-9: All empty (highest occupied row = 10, meaning no blocks).\n- Column 3: Highest occupied row = 4.\n- Column 4: Highest occupied row = 5.\n- Column 5: Highest occupied row = 5.\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe block has four rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°). We focus on 0° rotation, which is 3 columns wide (columns 0-2 of the block) and 2 rows tall (rows 0-1 of the block). Its shape is:\n```\n0*0\n***\n```\nThis means the block occupies:\n- Row 0 (top of the block): Column 1.\n- Row 1 (bottom of the block): Columns 0-2.\n\n### Placement Simulation (0° Rotation):\nFor 0° rotation, the block is 3 columns wide, so the leftmost drop coordinate (x) ranges from 1 to 8 (to fit within 10 columns). We evaluate x=4 (leftmost column 4, covering board columns 3-5, 0-based 3-5):\n- Columns 3-5 have highest occupied rows 4, 5, and 5, respectively.\n- The block falls until its bottom row (row 1 of the block) lands just above the highest occupied rows. The limiting column is 3 (highest occupied row 4), so the block’s bottom row (row 1) lands at row 3 (0-based 3).\n- The block’s top row (row 0) is at row 2 (0-based 2), and the bottom row (row 1) is at row 3 (0-based 3).\n\n### Validation:\n- The block fits within the board (no overlap with existing blocks or top boundary).\n- After placement, the block occupies:\n  - Row 2, column 4 (0-based 2, 4).\n  - Row 3, columns 3-5 (0-based 3, 3-5).\n- No full rows are cleared (existing rows have at most 3 blocks, and the placed block adds to rows 2 and 3, which remain below 10 blocks per row).\n\nThus, placing the 0° rotation at drop coordinate 4 is a stable and strategic move.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands as low as possible without exceeding the board's top boundary and ideally fills gaps in the existing structure.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has existing blocks primarily in columns 4-6. Columns 1-3 and 7-10 are mostly empty. Key observations about filled rows in columns 4-6:\n- **Column 4**: Filled in rows 5, 6, 7, 10.\n- **Column 5**: Filled in rows 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.\n- **Column 6**: Filled in rows 4, 6, 8, 9.\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe block has two unique rotations:\n1. **0°\/180°**: Shape is `**0` (top row) and `0**` (bottom row), covering 3 columns (width 3) and 2 rows (height 2).\n2. **90°\/270°**: Shape is `0*`, `**`, `*0` (3 rows, height 3; 2 columns, width 2).\n\n### Strategy:\nSince no full rows exist (score remains 0), the priority is to place the block in columns 4-6 to fill gaps and build up the structure. The 0° rotation (width 3) aligns well with the existing blocks in columns 4-6.\n\n### Placement for 0° Rotation:\n- **Drop Coordinate (x=4)**: The block covers columns 4, 5, 6. \n- **Landing Position**: The block falls until it hits existing blocks. For columns 4-6:\n  - Column 4: Empty until row 4 (lands at row 4).\n  - Column 5: Empty until row 2 (lands at row 2).\n  - Column 6: Empty until row 3 (lands at row 3).\n\nThe block settles with its top at row 2 and bottom at row 3, filling gaps in columns 4-6 without exceeding the board's top boundary.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current Tetris board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands without exceeding the board's top boundary and fits into the existing structure.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 rows (0-9) with scattered `*` (filled) and `.` (empty) squares. No rows are fully filled (score remains 0), so the priority is to place the block in a valid position.\n\n### Block Rotations:\n- **0°\/180°**: 3 columns wide, 2 rows high. Shape:  \n  Row 0: `0**` → occupied at (0,1), (0,2)  \n  Row 1: `**0` → occupied at (1,0), (1,1)  \n- **90°\/270°**: 2 columns wide, 3 rows high. Shape:  \n  Row 0: `*0` → occupied at (0,0)  \n  Row 1: `**` → occupied at (1,0), (1,1)  \n  Row 2: `0*` → occupied at (2,1)  \n\n\n### Valid Placement for 0° Rotation (x=5):\nThe 0° rotation is 3 columns wide, so the leftmost column (x) ranges from 1-8. For `x=5`, the block spans columns 5, 6, 7. The block’s occupied squares on the board are:  \n- (y, 6), (y, 7) (top row of the block)  \n- (y+1, 5), (y+1, 6) (bottom row of the block)  \n\nChecking from the bottom up, the block lands when these squares no longer overlap with existing `*` or the board bottom. At `y=3`, the squares are:  \n- (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6) → all empty.  \nMoving down to `y=4` causes a collision with row 5, column 5 (existing `*`). Thus, the block lands at `y=3`.\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the 0° rotation at `x=5` is valid and fits into the board without collisions.\n\nAnswer: 5 0"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The current block is an I-block with horizontal (0°\/180°) and vertical (90°\/270°) rotations. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Horizontal Rotation (0°\/180°)**: The block spans 4 columns. Placing it horizontally would land in rows 4-9, but no row has enough existing blocks to clear a line (max 3 existing blocks per row).\n2. **Vertical Rotation (90°\/270°)**: The block spans 4 rows. Placing it vertically in a column with existing gaps can help fill spaces without overcrowding the top. Column 5 has gaps between rows 4-5 and is a central column, making it a strategic choice.\n\n### Analysis of Vertical Placement in Column 5:\n- The highest occupied row in column 5 is row 5 (existing block). The vertical block (4 rows tall) will land such that its bottom row is just above row 5, occupying rows 1-4 (since the bottom row of the block is row 4, and the block spans rows 1-4). This placement is valid and avoids exceeding the top boundary.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the vertical block (90° rotation) in column 5 ensures it lands securely without blocking future moves and fits within the board boundaries.\n\nAnswer: 5 90","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations.

Column 3 (1-based, 0-based index 2) is ideal because:\n- Columns 2 and 3 (0-based) are empty (highest occupied row = 10).\n- The block will fall to the bottom, landing with its bottom row (row 2 of the block) at row 9 (board’s bottom row).\n- The block’s top row (row 0 of the block) will be at row 7 (board row 7), ensuring no overlap with existing blocks.\n\n### Verification:\nPlacing the 90° rotation at column 3 (1-based) covers columns 2 and 3 (0-based).

The goal is to place the 2x2 block such that it lands stably and avoids ending the game prematurely.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The 2x2 block occupies 2 consecutive columns and 2 consecutive rows.\n- The block falls until it hits existing blocks or the bottom row (row 9).\n- The rotation angle is irrelevant since the block is symmetric.\n\n### Drop Coordinate Evaluation:\nWe evaluate possible drop coordinates (1-9) to find where the block can land:\n- **Column 5 (x=5)**: Column 5 has a vertical stack of blocks from row 1 to row 6. Placing the block here would collide with existing blocks in rows 1-6.\n- **Column 7 (x=7)**: Columns 7 and 8 (indexes 6 and 7) have sparse blocks. The highest existing blocks in these columns are in row 6 (column 7) and row 8 (column 8). The block can fall to row 7-8 without collision.\n- **Column 3 (x=3)**: Columns 3 and 4 (indexes 2 and 3) have existing blocks in lower rows (row 8 and 9), but upper rows (row 6-7) are mostly empty. The block can land here without overlapping.\n\n### Optimal Move:\nAfter evaluating, the block can stably land in column 5 (x=5) with any rotation (since symmetry). This position avoids collisions with existing blocks and does not exceed the top boundary.\n\nAnswer: 5 0"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The current block is a 2x2 square (denoted by `**` in both rows for all rotations), meaning its shape remains unchanged regardless of rotation. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Block Shape**: The block is a 2x2 square, so all rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) are identical. This makes the rotation angle irrelevant for placement.\n2. **Board State**: The board is completely empty, so the block will fall to the bottom row (row 10) without obstruction.\n3. **Drop Coordinate**: The block occupies 2 columns, so the leftmost coordinate (drop coordinate) must range from 1 to 9 to fit within the 10-column board (since 1 + 2 - 1 = 2, and 9 + 2 - 1 = 10, covering columns 1-2 and 9-10, respectively).\n\n### Solution:\nSince the block’s shape is identical across all rotations, any rotation angle is valid. For simplicity, we choose 0° rotation. The drop coordinate can be any value from 1 to 9. Here, we select 1 as the drop coordinate (leftmost position).\n\nAnswer: 1 0","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board, existing blocks, and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block as low as possible to avoid stacking near the top and set up for future line clears.\n\n### Current Board State:\nThe board has 10 rows (top to bottom: rows 1–10). Rows 9 and 10 (second-from-bottom and bottom rows) have blocks in columns 1 and 2 (denoted as `**........`). All other rows are empty.\n\n### Falling Block Rotations:\nThe block has four rotations:\n- **0°**: 2 rows tall, 3 columns wide. Shape:  \n  Row 1: `0*0` (only column 2 filled)  \n  Row 2: `***` (columns 1–3 filled)  \n- **90°**: 3 rows tall, 2 columns wide.  \n- **180°**: 2 rows tall, 3 columns wide (inverted 0°).  \n- **270°**: 3 rows tall, 2 columns wide (inverted 90°).  \n\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The existing blocks occupy columns 1–2 in rows 9–10. Placing the new block in columns 3–5 avoids overlapping and spreads the stack to the right, preventing excessive left-side stacking.\n- **0° rotation** (2 rows tall, 3 columns wide) is ideal because it places the block’s bottom row (row 2 of the block) at the board’s bottom (row 10) and the top row (row 1 of the block) at row 9. This minimizes the stack height (top of the block at row 9, which is lower than other rotations like 90°\/270°, which place the top at row 8).\n- Dropping the 0° block at `x=3` (leftmost column 3) ensures the block spans columns 3–5. This avoids overlapping with existing blocks and fills rows 9–10 strategically:\n  - Row 9 (board row 9) gains a single block in column 4 (from the 0° block’s top row).\n  - Row 10 (board row 10) gains three blocks in columns 3–5 (from the 0° block’s bottom row).  \n\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the 0°-rotated block at column 3 optimally uses the empty space, avoids stacking high, and sets up for future line clears.\n\nAnswer: 3 0","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations to find the best placement that maximizes coverage and fills gaps.\n\n### Current Board State:\n- Rows 0-7: All empty (..........).\n- Row 8: **.*......

Row 8 has gaps in columns 3 and 5.\n\n### Analysis of 0° Rotation:\nThe 0° rotation is 3 columns wide (spanning columns \\(x, x+1, x+2\\)) and 2 rows tall. For \\(x=6\\) (leftmost column 6), the block spans columns 6-8. \n\n- **Landing Position**: The block falls until it hits the bottom (row 9) or existing blocks. Since columns 6-8 in rows 0-8 are empty, the block lands at \\(y=8\\) (top row of the block at row 8, bottom row at row 9).  \n- **Cells Occupied**:  \n  - Row 8, column 7 (from the top row of the block: 0*0).  \n  - Row 9, columns 6-8 (from the bottom row of the block: ***).  \n\n### Impact:\n- Row 8: Column 7 is filled (previously empty).  \n- Row 9: Columns 6-8 are filled (previously empty), increasing the filled cells in row 9 from 5 to 8.  \n\nThis placement effectively fills gaps in the lower rows, making it the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: 6 0","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block. The board has 10 columns (1-10) and 10 rows (0-9, top to bottom). The bottom two rows (rows 8 and 9) have partial fills: row 8 is \"**.*..*...\" (columns 1, 2, 4, 7 filled), and row 9 is \"********..\" (columns 1-8 filled). The current block is an I-tetromino, which can be horizontal (0° or 180°, 4 columns wide) or vertical (90° or 270°, 4 rows tall, 1 column wide).\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Horizontal Block (0°\/180°)**: 4 columns wide. Placing it would require covering 4 consecutive columns. However, rows 8 and 9 have gaps, but no row can be fully cleared with this block (row 9 needs 2 more fills, row 8 needs 6, and the block only provides 4).\n- **Vertical Block (90°\/270°)**: 1 column wide, 4 rows tall. Placing it in an empty column (e.g., columns 9 or 10) avoids overlapping existing blocks and leaves more flexibility for future moves. Columns 9 and 10 are entirely empty in all rows, making them ideal for vertical placement.\n\n### Optimal Action:\nPlacing the vertical block (90° rotation) in column 9. This block will fall to the bottom, occupying rows 6-9 of column 9 (since it is 4 rows tall). This placement avoids blocking critical columns and keeps the board balanced for future blocks.\n\nAnswer: 9 90","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board, the falling block's rotations, and potential landing positions. The goal is to place the block such that it lands without exceeding the top boundary and maximizes stability (though no immediate line clears are possible here).\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 rows, with the bottom rows (rows 7-10) having scattered blocks. Row 10 is mostly filled (9 blocks), row 9 has blocks in columns 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, and rows 7-8 have a single block in column 9.\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe current block has four rotations:\n- **0°**: 2 rows, width 3 (`*00` over `***`).\n- **90°**: 3 rows, width 2 (`**` over `*0` over `*0`).\n- **180°**: 2 rows, width 3 (`***` over `00*`).\n- **270°**: 3 rows, width 2 (`0*` over `0*` over `**`).\n\n### Valid Placement Check:\nWe focus on the 90° rotation (width 2) and x=3 (leftmost column 3). This rotation spans columns 3 and 4. The block’s shape for 90° is:\n- Row 1 (top): `**` (columns 3, 4).\n- Row 2: `*0` (column 3).\n- Row 3 (bottom): `*0` (column 3).\n\n### Landing Position:\nThe block falls until it hits an obstruction. For x=3 and 90° rotation:\n- The bottom row (row 3 of the block) lands in row 9 (board row 9). The block’s cells occupy:\n  - Row 7 (board row 7): columns 3, 4.\n  - Row 8 (board row 8): column 3.\n  - Row 9 (board row 9): column 3.\n\nThis placement is valid, as all positions are empty in the board, and no overlap occurs with existing blocks.\n\nAnswer: 3 90","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board, block rotations, and potential placements. The goal is to place the block such that it lands stably, avoids exceeding the board's top boundary, and ideally fills gaps to prepare for future row clears.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 rows (0-based 0 to 9) and 10 columns (1-based 1 to 10). Key observations:\n- Rows 0–5 are completely empty (all `.`).\n- Rows 6–9 have partial fills, with the highest occupied rows in columns 3, 4, and 9 (1-based) at row 6 (0-based).\n- Row 9 (0-based) is nearly full (9 `*`s, column 10 (1-based) is empty).\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe current block has four rotations:\n- **0°**: 3 columns wide (shape: `*00` over `***`).\n- **90°**: 2 columns wide (shape: `**` over `*0` over `*0`).\n- **180°**: 3 columns wide (shape: `***` over `00*`).\n- **270°**: 2 columns wide (shape: `0*` over `0*` over `**`).\n\n### Placement Strategy:\nWe prioritize placing the block to land as low as possible, filling gaps near the highest existing blocks (row 6 in columns 3, 4, 9). The 0° rotation (3 columns wide) fits well here, as its bottom row (`***`) can fill gaps above the existing hill in columns 3–4 (1-based).\n\n### Detailed Placement:\n- **0° rotation**: Width = 3 columns. Leftmost column 3 (1-based) covers columns 3–5 (1-based, 0-based 2–4).\n- **Landing Row Calculation**: The highest occupied rows in columns 3–5 (1-based) are row 6 (0-based) for columns 3–4 and row 9 (0-based) for column 5. The block’s bottom row (row 1 of the block) lands at row 5 (0-based), ensuring it rests on the existing hill without overlapping.\n\n### Validation:\n- The block’s cells in rows 4–5 (0-based) and columns 2–4 (0-based) are all empty in the current board, confirming valid placement.\n\nAnswer: 3 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current Tetris board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block as low as possible, ideally setting up for future line clears. \n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 rows (0 to 9, top to bottom). Lower rows (4–9) have clusters in columns 2–4 and column 8. Row 9 is nearly full (9\/10 filled), with only column 9 empty. Row 8 has 6\/10 filled columns (0–3, 6, 8), leaving columns 4, 5, 7, 9 empty.\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe falling block has four rotations:\n- **0°**: 2 rows high, 3 columns wide. Cells: (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2).\n- **90°**: 3 rows high, 2 columns wide. Cells: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1).\n- **180°**: 2 rows high, 3 columns wide.

Cells: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1).\n\n### Key Observations:\nRow 8 is a priority because filling its empty columns (4, 5, 7, 9) can lead to a future line clear. The **90° rotation** (3 rows high, 2 columns wide) is well-suited to fill row 8’s columns 4 and 5. \n\n### Placement for 90° Rotation:\n- **Leftmost column (x=5)**: This positions the block over columns 4 and 5 (0-based: c=4).\n- **Landing row**: The block falls until it hits existing blocks or the bottom. For 90° at x=5 (c=4), the cells are:\n  - (r, 4), (r+1, 4), (r+2, 4), (r+2, 5).\n- **Validation**: Checking from the bottom up, the highest valid row (r=6) ensures all cells (6,4), (7,4), (8,4), (8,5) are empty. Placing here fills row 8’s columns 4 and 5, reducing its empty columns to 2 (7, 9).\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the 90° rotation at leftmost column 5 optimally fills row 8, setting up for future line clears.\n\nAnswer: 5 90","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations to find a valid placement that avoids overlapping existing blocks and stays within the board boundaries. \n\n### Current Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 columns (1-10) and 10 rows (top row 0 to bottom row 9).

However, 0° and 180° are identical, as are 90° and 270°.

A reasonable choice is to place the block in the middle of the board for balance. For the 90° rotation (2 columns wide), a drop coordinate of 4 ensures the block is centered (columns 4 and 5), and the rotation angle of 90° is valid.\n\nAnswer: 4 90","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's possible rotations and positions.

Columns 6-9 are mostly empty (no existing blocks), so a horizontal block placed here will fall to the bottom row (row 9).\n2. **Vertical Block (90°\/270°):** A vertical block (1 column wide) would occupy 4 consecutive rows. Placing it in an empty column (e.g., column 6) would stack 4 rows, which is less optimal than placing a horizontal block at the bottom.\n\n### Optimal Move:\nPlacing the horizontal block (0° rotation) at column 6 (leftmost column 6) covers columns 6-9.

The block’s top row (row 0) in column 6 can land at row 5 (two rows above the occupied row).  \n\nThe block stabilizes with its bottom row (row 1) at row 6, and top row (row 0) at row 5. This placement avoids overlapping existing blocks and fits within the board boundaries.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the block at drop coordinate 4 with 0° rotation is valid and stable.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands as low as possible, minimizes gaps, and avoids stacking too high.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has empty rows (0-4) and filled rows (5-9) with gaps in columns 0-3. Key filled areas are in columns 3-8 of rows 5-9. The highest filled rows in columns 3-5 are row 5 (column 4\/5) and row 6 (column 3), while columns 0-2 are entirely empty.\n\n### Block Rotations:\n- **0°**: 2 rows, 3 columns. Shape: `00*` (top row), `***` (bottom row). Covers columns \\( X-1, X, X+1 \\) (0-based) when placed at leftmost coordinate \\( X \\) (1-based).\n- **90°**: 3 rows, 2 columns. Shape: `*0`, `*0`, `**`. Covers columns \\( X-1, X \\) (0-based).\n- **180°**: 2 rows, 3 columns. Shape: `***` (top row), `*00` (bottom row). Covers columns \\( X-1, X, X+1 \\) (0-based).\n- **270°**: 3 rows, 2 columns. Shape: `**`, `0*`, `0*`. Covers columns \\( X-1, X \\) (0-based).\n\n### Optimal Placement:\nThe 0° rotation (2 rows tall) is chosen to minimize stack height. Placing it at \\( X=3 \\) (1-based) aligns the block with the leftmost empty columns (0-2), filling gaps and building a foundation. The block’s bottom row (`***`) covers columns 2-4 (0-based), and the top row (`00*`) covers column 4 (0-based). This placement avoids overlapping existing blocks and lands at row 3 (0-based), the lowest possible row without obstruction.\n\nAnswer: 3 0","\nTo solve this Tetris problem, we need to determine the optimal placement (drop coordinate and rotation) for the current falling block (an I-tetromino) such that it lands within the board boundaries without causing a game over. The block can be rotated to 0°, 90°, 180°, or 270°, and we need to evaluate each rotation and possible drop coordinate.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The board has 10 rows (top to bottom: rows 0 to 9) and 10 columns (left to right: columns 1 to 10).\n- The current block is an I-tetromino, which is horizontal (4 squares in a row) for 0° and 180°, and vertical (4 squares in a column) for 90° and 270°.\n- The goal is to place the block such that it lands within the board (no part above row 0) and avoids immediate game over.\n\n### Analysis of Rotations and Drop Coordinates:\n#### Horizontal Rotations (0° and 180°):\nThe block spans 4 columns. The leftmost drop coordinate (x) ranges from 1 to 7 (since 1 + 4 - 1 = 4 and 7 + 4 - 1 = 10, covering columns 1 to 10). For x=5 (columns 5-8):\n- Columns 5-8 are mostly empty except for row 9 (columns 4-8 are occupied) and row 5 (column 5 is occupied).\n- The block will land at row 4 (the highest row where all columns 5-8 are empty above the first occupied rows below). This placement keeps the block entirely within the board.\n\n#### Vertical Rotations (90° and 270°):\nThe block spans 4 rows. The leftmost drop coordinate (x) ranges from 1 to 10 (since it is 1 column wide). However, vertical placement requires checking if the block fits within the board. For example, placing a vertical block in column 5 would require rows 1-4 (to avoid overlapping with occupied rows below), which is valid but does not clear lines.\n\n### Optimal Move:\nPlacing the horizontal block (0° rotation) at drop coordinate 5 (columns 5-8) and row 4 ensures the block lands within the board without overlapping with existing blocks or exceeding the top boundary. This is a safe and valid move.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board, the falling block's rotations, and potential placements to minimize stack height and avoid holes. \n\n### Board Analysis\nThe board has 10 rows (top to bottom: rows 1–10). Key filled regions include:\n- Row 3: Columns 5–8 filled.\n- Row 5: Columns 3–5 filled.\n- Row 7: Columns 4–5 filled.\n- Row 10: Columns 5–9 filled.\n\n### Block Rotations\nThe current block has four rotations:\n- **0°**: 3 columns wide (cells at (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)).\n- **90°**: 2 columns wide (cells at (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0)).\n- **180°**: 3 columns wide (cells at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,1)).\n- **270°**: 2 columns wide (cells at (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1)).\n\n### Placement Strategy\nThe goal is to place the block as low as possible to minimize stack height. The 0° rotation (3 columns wide) is chosen because it can land in the middle of the board (columns 5–7) where the highest filled row (row 3) allows the block to settle in rows 1–2 (currently empty), avoiding collisions and minimizing height.\n\n### Validation\nPlacing the 0° rotation at leftmost coordinate 5 (columns 5–7) results in:\n- Top row of the block (row 0) in row 1, column 6.\n- Bottom row of the block (row 1) in row 2, columns 5–7.\n\nThis placement is valid (no overlap with existing blocks) and keeps the stack height low.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","\nTo solve this Tetris problem, we need to determine where to drop the 2x2 block (which is rotationally symmetric, so any rotation angle is equivalent) such that it lands without overlapping existing blocks and maximizes the score potential. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Block Shape**: The current block is a 2x2 square, meaning it occupies 2 columns and 2 rows regardless of rotation.\n2. **Board Analysis**: The board has 10 columns. We need to find the leftmost column (1-9) where the block can land without overlapping existing blocks (`*`).\n\n### Evaluation of Possible Positions:\n- **Columns 1-2 (x=1)**: All rows in columns 1 and 2 are empty (`.`). The block can fall to the bottom (rows 9 and 10) without overlapping existing blocks.\n- **Columns 2-9 (x=2 to x=9)**: These columns have existing blocks in higher rows (smaller row indices). Placing the block here would overlap with existing blocks, making them invalid.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only valid position is x=1 (leftmost column 1), with any rotation (since the block is symmetric). \n\nAnswer: 1 0","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands without exceeding the top boundary and ideally fills gaps to prepare for line clears.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 columns (0-9) and 10 rows (0-9, top to bottom). Existing blocks (`*`) are spread across various rows, with no complete rows (score=0). Key gaps to note include row9, column5 (empty), and row8, columns5-6 (empty).\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe current block has two unique rotations:\n- **0°\/180°**: 2 rows tall, 3 columns wide, shape:  \n  `**0`  \n  `0**`  \n- **90°\/270°**: 3 rows tall, 2 columns wide, shape:  \n  `0*`  \n  `**`  \n  `*0`  \n\n### Strategy:\nThe 90°\/270° rotation (3 rows tall, 2 columns wide) is more versatile for filling gaps. We focus on placing this rotation to fill the empty column5 in row9 and the empty columns5-6 in row8.\n\n### Placement Check for 90° Rotation:\n- **Drop Coordinate**: 6 (column5, since drop coordinate = column index + 1).  \n- **Block Coverage**: Columns5 and 6 (width=2).  \n- **Landing Position**: The block falls until it hits existing blocks or the bottom. For 90° rotation, the block’s cells are:  \n  - Row `r`, column6  \n  - Row `r+1`, column5  \n  - Row `r+1`, column6  \n  - Row `r+2`, column5  \n\n### Validation:\n- **Row7, column6**: Empty (row7: `...*......`).  \n- **Row8, column5**: Empty (row8: `**.**.....`).  \n- **Row8, column6**: Empty (row8: `**.**.....`).  \n- **Row9, column5**: Empty (row9: `**..*****.`).  \n\nPlacing the block at drop coordinate 6 with 90° rotation fills these empty cells without overlapping existing blocks or exceeding the top boundary.\n\nAnswer: 6 90"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The board has 10 columns and 10 rows, with the bottom two rows (rows 9 and 10, 1-based) containing `**` in columns 5 and 6. The goal is to place the block such that it lands as low as possible without overlapping existing blocks and sets up for future row clears.\n\n### Current Block Analysis:\nThe block has four rotations, but 0° and 180° are identical, while 90° and 270° are identical. The 0° rotation (used here) has the shape:\n```\n0**\n**0\n```\nThis block is 3 columns wide (columns 5, 6, 7 when placed at drop coordinate 5) and 2 rows tall. The filled cells are in positions (row 0, column 6-7) and (row 1, column 5-6) relative to the board.\n\n### Placement Logic:\nThe block falls until it hits existing blocks or the bottom. The existing `**` in rows 9 and 10 (columns 5-6) mean the block will land when its bottom row (row 1 of the block) aligns with row 8 (1-based), just above the existing blocks.

To land, it requires the lowest row where its columns are unobstructed. The highest filled cells in columns 4–7 (1-based) are in rows 7–8 (1-based), so the block will land in row 6 (1-based, 0-based 5).\n2. **Vertical Block (90°\/270°)**: A vertical block (* in 4 rows) spans 1 column.

To place it, we need 4 consecutive columns. Columns 5-8 are the most relevant, as they already have filled cells in lower rows, which will limit how far the block can fall.\n2. **Vertical Rotations (90°\/270°)**: The block is 4 cells tall vertically. However, no column has 4 consecutive empty rows to accommodate this rotation, as most columns (especially 5-8) have filled cells in multiple rows, leaving insufficient space.\n\n### Analysis of Horizontal Placement:\nFor horizontal placement (0°\/180°), the block will fall until it hits existing filled cells or the bottom. Columns 5-8 have filled cells starting at row 1 (column 5 and 6) and row 2 (column 7). The block will land at row 0 (the topmost empty row) because row 1 in columns 5 and 6 is already filled, preventing further downward movement. Placing the block at `x=5` (leftmost column 5) covers columns 5-8, aligning with the existing filled cells in these columns and minimizing gaps for future blocks.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe optimal action is to place the horizontal block (0° rotation) at column 5, as it aligns with existing filled columns and avoids leaving unnecessary gaps.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block.

It can only be placed in columns 1-4 (since columns 5-8 are already filled at the top row, and columns 9-10 are too narrow for a 4-column block). Placing it in columns 1-4 (leftmost coordinate 1) allows it to fall to the bottom (row 10) without overlapping existing blocks.\n   \n2. **Vertical Block (90°\/270°)**: This block is 1 column wide and 4 rows tall. While it can be placed in empty columns (1-4 or 9-10), it does not contribute to clearing lines and only fills a single column, which is less efficient than the horizontal block for building toward future line clears.\n\n### Best Action:\nPlacing the horizontal block (0° rotation) at the leftmost valid column (1) allows it to fall to the bottom, filling columns 1-4 in row 10.

The highest occupied rows are row 8 (column 4) and row 9 (columns 4-6). \n\n### Current Block Rotations:\n- **0°**: Shape is 2 rows high and 3 columns wide:  \n  Row 0: *00 (column x)  \n  Row 1: *** (columns x, x+1, x+2)  \n- **90°**: Shape is 3 rows high and 2 columns wide:  \n  Row 0: ** (columns x, x+1)  \n  Row 1: *0 (column x)  \n  Row 2: *0 (column x)  \n- **180°**: Shape is 2 rows high and 3 columns wide:  \n  Row 0: *** (columns x, x+1, x+2)  \n  Row 1: 00* (column x+2)  \n- **270°**: Shape is 3 rows high and 2 columns wide:  \n  Row 0: 0* (column x+1)  \n  Row 1: 0* (column x+1)  \n  Row 2: ** (columns x, x+1)  \n\n### Key Observations:\n- The existing blocks in row 9 (columns 4-6) and row 8 (column 4) suggest aligning the new block with these columns (4-6) to build a flat surface.  \n- The 0° rotation’s bottom row (***, columns x, x+1, x+2) fits naturally into columns 4-6 when placed at x=4, as it will land on top of the empty rows above the existing blocks.  \n\n### Landing Position for 0° Rotation at x=4:\n- The block covers columns 4-6 (x=4).  \n- The highest existing blocks in these columns are row 8 (column 4) and row 9 (columns 5-6).  \n- The block falls until its bottom row (row 1 of the block) lands on row 7 (since row 8, column 4 is occupied).  \n\n### Outcome:\nPlacing the 0° rotation at x=4 fills row 7 (columns 4-6) and row 6 (column 4), aligning with the existing blocks in row 9 (columns 4-6). This setup is optimal for future line clears.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board, existing blocks, and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands without exceeding the top boundary and aligns with existing blocks to potentially set up future line clears.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 columns (1-10) and 10 rows (0-9, top to bottom). Existing blocks are concentrated in columns 4-6:\n- Row 6: Column 4 is filled.\n- Row 7: Columns 4-6 are filled.\n- Row 8: Column 4 is filled.\n- Row 9: Columns 4-6 are filled.\n\n### Current Block Rotations:\nThe block has four rotations, with 0°\/180° and 90°\/270° being identical. Key rotations:\n- **0°\/180°**: 2 rows high, 3 columns wide. Cells: (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1).\n- **90°\/270°**: 3 rows high, 2 columns wide. Cells: (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1).\n\n### Placement Strategy:\nWe prioritize placing the block in columns 4-6 to build on existing blocks. For the 90° rotation (3 rows high, 2 columns wide), placing it at **X=4** (leftmost column 4) covers columns 4 and 5. This aligns with the existing blocks in column 4 (rows 6,7,8,9) and column 5 (rows 7,9), minimizing gaps and supporting future line clears.\n\n### Simulation:\n- **90° rotation at X=4**: The block covers columns 4 and 5. Its cells are (r,4), (r+1,4), (r+1,5), (r+2,5). \n- The block falls until it hits existing blocks. The highest existing block in column 4 is row 6, so the block lands at row 4 (r=4), with cells in rows 4, 5, and 6. This placement is valid and does not exceed the top boundary.\n\nAnswer: 4 90","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations to find the best placement that avoids overlapping existing blocks and sets up for future line clears. \n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe board has existing blocks concentrated in columns 3-5, with gaps in columns 4-6 of the upper rows (rows 3-4). The goal is to place the block to fill these gaps without overlapping existing blocks.\n\n### Block Rotations and Placement:\n1. **0° Rotation**: The block shape is:\n   ```\n   *00\n   ***\n   ```\n   This is a 2-row, 3-column block. The top row has a single `*` in column `x`, and the bottom row has three `*`s in columns `x`, `x+1`, `x+2`.\n\n2. **Target Columns**: Columns 4-6 (leftmost coordinate `x=4`) are mostly empty in rows 3-4, making them ideal for placement. Placing the block here will fill gaps in these columns.\n\n3. **Landing Position**: The block will fall until it hits an obstacle or the bottom. For `x=4`, the block's bottom row (columns 4-6) in row 4 is empty, and the row below (row 5, column 4) has an existing block, preventing further descent. Thus, the block lands at row 4.\n\n### Verification:\n- **Top Row (row 3, column 4)**: Empty (`.`), so no overlap.\n- **Bottom Row (row 4, columns 4-6)**: Empty (`.`), so no overlap.\n- **Obstruction Check**: Row 5, column 4 has an existing block (`*`), ensuring the block cannot fall further.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the 0°-rotated block at leftmost coordinate 4 fills gaps in columns 4-6, setting up the board for potential future line clears.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board, existing blocks, and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands as low as possible without exceeding the top boundary and ideally prepares for future line clears.\n\n### Current Board Analysis:\nThe board has existing blocks concentrated in columns 4-6 (rows 3-10). Columns 1-3 are mostly empty, providing space to place the block without immediate collisions.\n\n### Block Rotations and Placement:\nThe current block has four rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°). We focus on 0° rotation, which has a 3-column width and 2-row height, making it suitable for columns 1-3 (empty space).\n\n#### 0° Rotation:\n- **Shape**: \n  - Row 0: `00*` (cells at (c+2, y))\n  - Row 1: `***` (cells at (c, y+1), (c+1, y+1), (c+2, y+1))\n- **Width**: 3 columns (c, c+1, c+2)\n- **Drop Coordinate (c)**: 1 (leftmost column 1, covering columns 1-3).\n\n### Landing Position:\nSince columns 1-3 are empty, the block falls to the bottom. The bottom row of the block (y+1) aligns with row 10 (the board's bottom). Thus, the block lands at y=9 (top row of the block), with cells:\n- (3, 9) from row 0 (`00*`)\n- (1, 10), (2, 10), (3, 10) from row 1 (`***`).\n\nThis placement is valid, as all cells are within the board and do not overlap with existing blocks.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands safely without exceeding the top boundary and avoids raising the stack in already crowded columns.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has existing blocks concentrated in columns 3-6 (left to right). Columns 7-10 are mostly empty, making them ideal for placing the block to keep the stack low. \n\n### Block Rotations:\n- **0° and 180°**: The block is 3 columns wide (shape: `**0` over `0**`), covering columns `x, x+1, x+2`.\n- **90° and 270°**: The block is 2 columns wide (shape: `0*` over `**` over `*0`), covering columns `x, x+1`.\n\n### Optimal Placement:\nColumns 7-10 are empty (no existing blocks), so placing the block here minimizes stack height. For the 0° rotation (3 columns wide), the leftmost column (`x`) can be 7, covering columns 7, 8, 9. This ensures the block falls to the bottom (row 9) without overlapping existing blocks.\n\n### Verification:\n- **0° rotation at x=7**: The block covers columns 7, 8, 9. The top row of the block (`y`) is 8 (since the bottom row of the block is row 9). The cells are placed at (8,7), (8,8), (9,8), (9,9), which are all empty and valid.\n\nAnswer: 7 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block as low as possible without overlapping existing blocks, ideally setting up for future line clears.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 rows (top: row 0, bottom: row 9). Key filled columns are:\n- **Columns 0-2**: Filled in rows 8 (column 2) and 9 (columns 0-2).\n- **Columns 3-5**: Heavily filled from row 2 to row 7 (row 3, 5, 7 have additional fills).\n- **Columns 6-7**: Filled in rows 8-9.\n- **Columns 8-9**: Mostly empty.\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe block has two distinct rotations:\n1. **0°\/180°**: 2 rows high, 3 columns wide (shape: `0**`\/`**0`).\n2. **90°\/270°**: 3 rows high, 2 columns wide (shape: `*0`\/`**`\/`0*`).\n\n### Optimal Placement:\nFor the 90° rotation (3 rows high, 2 columns wide), placing the block in columns 5-6 (1-based drop coordinate 6) allows it to fall to row 5 (0-based). This position avoids overlapping existing blocks and lands the block relatively low:\n- **Columns 5-6**: Column 5 has fills in rows 3, 7; column 6 has fills in rows 8, 9.\n- **Block Squares**: (row 5, col 5), (row 6, col 5), (row 6, col 6), (row 7, col 6) are all empty, allowing the block to land at row 5.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the block at drop coordinate 6 with 90° rotation is optimal, as it lands the block low without overlapping existing fills.\n\nAnswer: 6 90","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands without exceeding the top boundary and ideally positions blocks to clear rows (though no rows can be cleared immediately here).\n\n### Current Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 rows (top to bottom: rows 1-10). Key filled regions include:\n- Row 10: `******.**.` (columns 1-6, 8-9 filled)\n- Row 9: `..**..**..` (columns 3-4, 7-8 filled)\n- Row 8: `...***....` (columns 4-6 filled)\n- Rows 6-7: `...**.....` (columns 4-5 filled)\n- Row 4: `...****...` (columns 4-7 filled)\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe block has four rotations. We focus on the 0° rotation, which is 3 columns wide and 2 rows tall:\n```\n0°:\n0*0\n***\n```\nThis shape has a top row with a single middle block (`0*0`) and a bottom row with three consecutive blocks (`***`).\n\n### Placement Logic for 0° Rotation:\nThe 0° rotation occupies columns `x, x+1, x+2` (3 columns wide). We need to find the leftmost column `x` where the block can land without exceeding the top boundary (row 1).\n\n#### Candidate: `x=3` (columns 3, 4, 5):\n- **Top row of the block** (row `R-1` on the board) has a single block at column `x+1=4`.\n- **Bottom row of the block** (row `R` on the board) has blocks at columns `x=3`, `x+1=4`, and `x+2=5`.\n\n### Landing Position:\nThe block falls until it hits existing blocks or the bottom. For `x=3`:\n- Column 3: Filled in rows 9-10 (empty above row 9).\n- Column 4: Filled in rows 4-10 (empty above row 4).\n- Column 5: Filled in rows 4, 6-8, 10 (empty above row 4).\n\nThe highest empty row where the block can land is row 2 (board row 2). The top row of the block (row `R-1=1`) is within the board (row 1), so it is valid.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the 0°-rotated block at `x=3` (leftmost column 3) lands it without exceeding the top boundary.\n\nAnswer: 3 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it fits into the existing structure without creating gaps, as no immediate line clears are possible.\n\n### Current Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 columns (0-9) and 10 rows (0-9, top to bottom). Existing blocks are sparse, with no rows close to being fully filled. The falling block is a Z-shaped tetromino with rotations at 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°. The 0° and 180° rotations are identical (3 columns wide, 2 rows tall), while the 90° and 270° rotations are identical (2 columns wide, 3 rows tall).\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **0°\/180° Rotation**: 3 columns wide. Placing this rotation in most positions overlaps with existing blocks due to the board's current structure.\n- **90°\/270° Rotation**: 2 columns wide. This rotation is more flexible and can fit into narrower gaps.\n\n### Evaluation of 90° Rotation:\nThe 90° rotation has a 3-row tall, 2-column wide shape. We need to find a position where the block can fall without overlapping existing blocks. Testing `x=6` (leftmost column 6, 0-based column 5) for the 90° rotation:\n- The block occupies columns 5 and 6.\n- The block’s squares are: (row 5, column 5), (row 6, column 5), (row 6, column 6), (row 7, column 6).\n- These positions are all empty in the current board, and the block stops falling when it would overlap with row 8 (which contains existing blocks in column 5).\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the 90° rotation at `x=6` (leftmost column 6) is valid and avoids gaps, making it the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: 6 90"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Placing it in columns 1-4 (leftmost position, drop coordinate 1) allows it to fall to the bottom row (row 9) since these columns are empty. This avoids stacking on existing blocks and keeps the board balanced.\n3. **Vertical Block (90°\/270°)**: This shape spans 4 rows.

Horizontal placement is more optimal for spreading blocks evenly.\n\n### Best Move:\nPlacing the horizontal block (0° rotation) at drop coordinate 1 (columns 1-4) ensures the block lands at the bottom row (row 9) without creating high stacks, maintaining a balanced board state.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current Tetris board and the falling block's possible rotations and positions.

For brevity, we focus on a stable placement for the 90° rotation (2 columns wide) in columns 5-6 (x=5), as it fits well in the mostly empty mid-columns and avoids collisions with existing filled cells.\n\n### Placement Validation (90° rotation, x=5):\n- **Block Cells**: (r, 6), (r+1, 5), (r+1, 6), (r+2, 5).\n- **Landing Row**: The block falls until it hits existing filled cells. The highest filled cells in columns 5-6 are in row 5 (columns 5-6 are filled). Thus, the block lands at row r=3 (top row 3, covering rows 3-5).\n- **Collision Check**: All cells (3,6), (4,5), (4,6), (5,5) are empty before placement, and the next row (r=4) would collide with row 5's filled cells, confirming a stable landing.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the block at drop coordinate 5 with 90° rotation is valid and stable.\n\nAnswer: 5 90","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block. The board has 10 columns (1–10) and 10 rows (top to bottom). The current block is an \"I\" block, which can be horizontal (0° or 180°, 4 squares in a row) or vertical (90° or 270°, 4 squares in a column). \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Board State**: The bottom row (row 9) has `******....` (columns 0–5 filled, columns 6–9 empty).\n2. **Goal**: Clear a row to increase the score. A row is cleared if all 10 columns are filled.\n3. **Horizontal Block (0°\/180°)**: This block is 4 squares wide. Placing it in columns 6–9 (leftmost coordinate 7) would fill the empty columns 6–9 in row 9.\n\n### Analysis of Placement:\n- **Horizontal Block at Drop Coordinate 7 (columns 6–9)**: The block will fall to the bottom row (row 9) since columns 6–9 in row 9 are empty. Placing the block here fills all 10 columns in row 9, clearing the row and increasing the score by 1.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the horizontal block (0°) at drop coordinate 7 clears the bottom row, achieving the highest immediate score increase.\n\nAnswer: 7 0","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block to maximize row filling potential, considering existing gaps and future line clears.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 rows (top to bottom). Key observations:\n- Row 2: `......****` (columns 7-10 filled).\n- Rows 3-10 have partial fills, with gaps in columns 5-6 (e.g., Row 9: `....**....`).\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe block has four rotations:\n- **0°**: 2 rows high, 3 columns wide. Shape: `. * .` (top row) and `* * *` (bottom row).\n- **90°**: 3 rows high, 2 columns wide. Shape: `*` (top), `* *` (middle), `*` (bottom).\n- **180°**: 2 rows high, 3 columns wide. Shape: `* * *` (top), `. * .` (bottom).\n- **270°**: 3 rows high, 2 columns wide. Shape: `. *` (top), `* *` (middle), `. *` (bottom).\n\n### Strategy:\nThe 0° rotation (3 columns wide) is chosen to target the gap in columns 5-7 of Row 2, which is adjacent to the pre-filled columns 7-10 in Row 2. Placing the 0° rotation at `x=5` (leftmost column 5) covers columns 5-7 in the bottom row of the block and column 6 in the top row. This fills the gap in Row 2, bringing it closer to being fully filled (columns 5-10 would be filled after placement).\n\n### Placement Verification:\n- **0° rotation at x=5**:\n  - Top row of the block: column 6 (row y=1).\n  - Bottom row of the block: columns 5-7 (row y+1=2).\n- Existing Row 2: `......****` (columns 7-10 filled). After placement, Row 2 becomes `.....***..` (columns 5-7 filled) + `......****` (columns 7-10 filled), resulting in columns 5-10 filled. This builds toward a future line clear.\n\nAnswer: 5 0"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Its shape is:\n  ```\n  **\n  0*\n  0*\n  ```\n  For a drop coordinate `x`, the block occupies columns `(x-1)` and `x` (leftmost column is `x-1`).\n\n### Valid Placement for 270° Rotation\nWe need to find a drop coordinate `x` where the block can land without overlapping existing blocks or exceeding the top boundary. \n\n#### Drop Coordinate `x=7` (Columns 6 and 7)\n- **Block Cells**: \n  - Row `r` (top of the block): `(r, 6)`, `(r, 7)`\n  - Row `r+1`: `(r+1, 7)`\n  - Row `r+2`: `(r+2, 7)`\n- **Landing Check**: The block starts at the top (row 0) and falls until it collides with existing blocks or the bottom. For `x=7`, the cells `(0, 6)`, `(0, 7)`, `(1, 7)`, and `(2, 7)` are all empty (`.`). Moving down further would place `(1, 6)` (row 1, column 6), which is occupied (`*`), so the block stops at `r=0`.\n\n### Conclusion\nPlacing the 270° rotation at drop coordinate 7 is valid, as it lands without exceeding the top boundary and fits within the board.\n\nAnswer: 7 270","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current Tetris board and the falling block's rotations.

Same width as 0°, valid X ranges 1–8.\n  - **270°**: 2 columns wide (shape: `0*` in row 1, `**` in row 2, `0*` in row 3). Same width as 90°, valid X ranges 1–9.\n\n### Strategy:\nSince the board is empty, any valid placement is acceptable. A centered placement (to balance the board for future blocks) is reasonable. For the 0° rotation (3 columns wide), placing the leftmost coordinate at X=4 centers the block (columns 4–6), which is a common strategy in Tetris to maximize flexibility.\n\n### Solution:\nPlace the 0° rotation at leftmost coordinate 4.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","\nTo determine the optimal action for placing the current Tetris block, we analyze the game board, existing block positions, and the possible rotations of the falling block. \n\n### Current Board State:\nThe board has 10 columns and 10 rows. The lowest occupied rows are:\n- Row 9: `....*.....` (column 5 is occupied).\n- Row 10: `...***....` (columns 4, 5, 6 are occupied).\n\n### Current Block Rotations:\nThe block has four rotations:\n- **0°**: 2 rows, 3 columns wide. Shape:  \n  `0*0`  \n  `***`  \n- **90°**: 3 rows, 2 columns wide. Shape:  \n  `*0`  \n  `**`  \n  `*0`  \n- **180°**: 2 rows, 3 columns wide. Shape:  \n  `***`  \n  `0*0`  \n- **270°**: 3 rows, 2 columns wide. Shape:  \n  `0*`  \n  `**`  \n  `0*`  \n\n### Key Observations:\nThe existing blocks create a \"gap\" in column 5, row 8 (since row 9, column 5 and row 10, column 5 are occupied, but row 8, column 5 is empty). Filling this gap would help build a more even stack.\n\n### Analysis of 180° Rotation:\nThe 180° rotation has a top row of three consecutive blocks (`***`) and a bottom row with a single block in the middle (`0*0`). This shape is ideal for filling the gap in column 5, row 8. \n\n- **Width**: 3 columns (columns x, x+1, x+2).  \n- **Target Columns**: To align with the gap, we choose `x=4` (leftmost column 4), covering columns 4, 5, 6.  \n- **Landing Position**: The block will fall until it hits existing blocks or the bottom. The stack height in column 5 (row 8 is the first empty row above the occupied rows 9 and 10) determines the landing row. The block’s bottom row (middle block in column 5) will land in row 8, and the top row (columns 4, 5, 6) will land in row 7.  \n\n### Validation:\nPlacing the 180° rotation at `x=4` fills:\n- Row 7: columns 4, 5, 6 (top row of the block).  \n- Row 8: column 5 (bottom row of the block).  \n\nThis fills the gap in column 5, row 8, and aligns with the existing stack structure.\n\nAnswer: 4 180","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The board has existing blocks in rows 6-9, with columns 3-5 filled in rows 6 and 9, and column 4 filled in rows 7-9. The goal is to place the block such that it lands without overlapping existing blocks and maximizes stability.\n\n### Current Block Analysis:\n- **0°\/180° Rotation**: The block shape is:\n  ```\n  **0\n  0**\n  ```\n  This block spans 3 columns (width 3) and 2 rows (height 2). Cells are at (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2) (relative to the block's top-left corner).\n\n- **90°\/270° Rotation**: The block shape is:\n  ```\n  0*\n  **\n  *0\n  ```\n  This block spans 2 columns (width 2) and 3 rows (height 3). Cells are at (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0) (relative to the block's top-left corner).\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The existing blocks occupy columns 3-5 in rows 6 and 9, and column 4 in rows 7-8. Columns 0-2 and 6-9 are mostly empty.\n- For the 0°\/180° rotation (3 columns wide), placing the block in columns 3-5 (leftmost column 4, 1-based) aligns with the existing structure and avoids overlapping. The block will land in rows 4-5, as these rows are empty and below the highest existing blocks (row 6).\n\n### Validation:\n- **0° Rotation at Drop Coordinate 4**: The block spans columns 3-5 (0-based). The highest existing blocks in these columns are at row 6. The block’s height (2 rows) allows it to land in rows 4-5 without overlapping, as rows 4-5 are empty. This placement is valid and stable.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands stably without exceeding the top boundary and ideally fills gaps in the existing structure.\n\n### Current Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 rows (top to bottom: rows 0–9). Key filled columns are:\n- Column 4: Filled in rows 4–9.\n- Columns 3, 5: Partially filled in rows 4–9 (e.g., row 4: ...**.....; row 5: ....**....; row 6: ...***....; row 9: ...***....).\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe block has four rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°). We focus on 0° rotation, which has a 3-column width and 2-row height:\n- 0°: Top row (row 0 of block): `. * .` (column x+1). Bottom row (row 1 of block): `* * *` (columns x, x+1, x+2).\n\n### Placement Strategy:\nWe aim to place the block in columns 3–5 (leftmost coordinate x=3) with 0° rotation. This aligns with the existing filled columns 3–5 in lower rows, minimizing gaps. \n\n#### Landing Check for 0° Rotation (x=3):\n- The block covers columns 3, 4, 5. \n- Existing filled cells in these columns are in rows 4–9. The highest empty rows above these filled cells are rows 0–3. \n- The block falls until its bottom row (row 1 of the block) collides with existing filled cells. The first collision occurs when the bottom row (columns 3–5) reaches row 4 (already filled in columns 3 and 4). Thus, the block lands in row 3 (top row of the block) and row 4 (bottom row of the block).\n\n### Outcome:\nPlacing the 0° rotation at x=3 fills columns 3–5 in row 4 (completing the partial fill) and column 4 in row 3, stabilizing the structure without creating new gaps.\n\nAnswer: 3 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands without exceeding the top boundary and ideally fills gaps to facilitate future line clears.\n\n### Board Analysis\nThe board has 10 rows (0: top, 9: bottom) with scattered blocks. Key occupied columns (1-based) include:\n- Row 2: Column 4  \n- Row 3: Columns 3-5  \n- Row 4: Columns 4-5  \n- Row 5: Columns 5-6  \n- Row 6: Columns 4-5-6  \n- Rows 7-8: Column 5  \n- Row 9: Columns 4-5-6  \n\n### Block Rotations\nThe current block has four rotations. We focus on the 0° rotation, which has a 2-row height and 3-column width (shape: `*00` (top row), `***` (bottom row)). This rotation is suitable for filling gaps in columns 4-6, which have existing blocks in lower rows.\n\n### Placement Validation for 0° Rotation\nFor the 0° rotation (width 3, height 2), the leftmost coordinate (x) ranges from 1 to 8. We evaluate x=4 (columns 4-6):\n- The block occupies squares: (y, 4), (y+1, 4), (y+1, 5), (y+1, 6).  \n- The highest obstacle in column 4 is row 2 (occupied), column 5 is row 3 (occupied), and column 6 is row 5 (occupied).  \n- The block lands when its bottom row (y+1) is just above the highest obstacle. The highest valid y is 0 (top row), as placing the block at y=0 ensures it does not exceed the top boundary and lands without collision.\n\n### Conclusion\nPlacing the 0° rotation at x=4 (leftmost column 4) is valid, as it lands at row 0 without exceeding the top boundary.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block as low as possible without overlapping existing blocks or exceeding the board's top boundary.\n\n### Current Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 rows (top to bottom) and 10 columns. Existing blocks are concentrated in columns 4-6 across multiple rows, with sparse blocks in other columns. No rows are fully occupied (score = 0), so line clears are not possible.\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe block has four rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°). We evaluate each rotation to find valid positions:\n\n#### 0° Rotation:\nShape:  \n00*  \n***  \nWidth = 3 columns, Height = 2 rows.  \nTesting positions shows collisions with existing blocks in columns 4-6 (the most populated area), making placement difficult.\n\n#### 90° Rotation:\nShape:  \n*0  \n*0  \n**  \nWidth = 2 columns, Height = 3 rows.  \nTesting positions in columns 5-6 and 7-8 shows collisions with existing blocks in lower rows (e.g., row 9, column 5 is occupied).\n\n#### 180° Rotation:\nShape:  \n***  \n*00  \nWidth = 3 columns, Height = 2 rows.  \nSimilar to 0°, collisions occur in columns 4-6 due to existing blocks.\n\n#### 270° Rotation:\nShape:  \n**  \n0*  \n0*  \nWidth = 2 columns, Height = 3 rows.  \nTesting X=6 (leftmost column 6) places the block in columns 6-7. The block’s cells are:  \n- Row 8 (top of block): (6,8) and (7,8) (both empty).  \n- Row 9 (middle of block): (7,9) (empty).  \n- Row 10 (bottom of block): (7,10) (empty).  \n\nThis position is valid, with no collisions, and the block lands at the bottom row (row 10).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe 270° rotation placed at leftmost column 6 is optimal, as it lands at the bottom without collisions.\n\nAnswer: 6 270","\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal position and rotation for the current Tetris block (a 2x2 square) to land on the given game board. The block is identical in all rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°), so the rotation angle is irrelevant. The key is to find a valid leftmost column (drop coordinate) where the block can fall without overlapping existing blocks or exceeding the board boundaries.\n\n### Analysis of the Game Board:\nThe board has 10 columns (1-10) and 10 rows (top to bottom). The current block is a 2x2 square, so it occupies 2 consecutive rows and 2 consecutive columns. We need to identify columns where the block can fall to the bottom or land on existing blocks without collision.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The block is a square, so rotation has no effect. Any rotation angle (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) is valid.\n- Columns 1-2 (leftmost) and 8-9 (rightmost) are mostly empty, making them ideal for placing the block without collision.\n\n### Evaluation of Drop Coordinates:\n- **Columns 1-2 (drop coordinates 1-2)**: These columns are mostly empty in all rows. The block can fall to the bottom (rows 8-9) without collision.\n- **Columns 8-9 (drop coordinates 8-9)**: Similarly, these columns are empty in all rows. The block can fall to the bottom (rows 8-9) without collision.\n\n### Optimal Choice:\nThe rightmost valid columns (8-9) are chosen for simplicity, as they avoid potential future obstructions. The rotation angle is arbitrary (0° is chosen here).\n\nAnswer: 8 0","\nTo solve this Tetris problem, we need to determine the optimal placement for the current 2x2 block (O-block) on the given board. The block is rotationally symmetric (all rotations are identical), so the rotation angle does not affect the outcome. The goal is to find a valid drop coordinate (leftmost column) where the block can land without overlapping existing blocks.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Block Characteristics**: The current block is a 2x2 square (O-block), so it occupies 2 columns and 2 rows regardless of rotation.\n2. **Board Analysis**: The board has 10 columns (1-10) and 10 rows (0-9, top to bottom). We need to find a column range (1-9, since the block spans 2 columns) where the block can fall to the lowest possible row without overlapping existing blocks.\n3. **Line Clearing**: None of the rows on the board have 8 or more filled cells, so placing the block will not clear any lines (since a line clears only when fully occupied, requiring 10 filled cells). Thus, the priority is to find any valid placement.\n\n### Valid Placement Check:\nWe evaluate each possible drop coordinate (1-9) to see if the block can land:\n- **x=1 (columns 1-2)**: The block can fall to the bottom of the board (rows 8-9) since columns 1-2 are empty in all rows. Placing the block here does not overlap existing blocks.\n- Other coordinates (e.g., x=2-9) either overlap existing blocks or cannot reach the bottom due to obstructions in lower rows.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe leftmost valid drop coordinate is 1, and any rotation angle (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) is acceptable since the block is symmetric. Choosing 0° as the rotation angle.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands without exceeding the top boundary and ideally sets up for future line clears.\n\n### Current Board Analysis\nThe board has existing blocks concentrated in columns 3-6 and some in columns 0-1 and 7-8. No rows are fully occupied (score is 0), so the priority is to place the block without stacking too high.\n\n### Block Rotations\nThe current block has two unique rotations (0°\/180° and 90°\/270°). \n\n- **0°\/180°**: 2 rows tall, 3 columns wide, with squares at (row a, x), (row a, x+1), (row a+1, x+1), (row a+1, x+2).  \n- **90°\/270°**: 3 rows tall, 2 columns wide, with squares at (row a, x+1), (row a+1, x), (row a+1, x+1), (row a+2, x).\n\n### Key Observations\n- The 90° rotation (3 rows tall, 2 columns wide) is more versatile for fitting into gaps.  \n- Columns 5-6 have fewer existing blocks, making them a candidate for placement.  \n\n### Placement Check for 90° Rotation at x=5\nFor 90° rotation with leftmost column x=5 (covers columns 5 and 6):  \n- The block’s squares are (row a, 6), (row a+1, 5), (row a+1, 6), (row a+2, 5).  \n- Checking from the top down, the highest row where these squares are empty and the block can land is row a=6.  \n\n### Outcome\nPlacing the 90° block at x=5 (leftmost column 5) lands it at row 6, filling in gaps without stacking excessively. No lines are cleared immediately, but this placement avoids blocking future opportunities.\n\nAnswer: 5 90"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The existing blocks are in row 9 (columns 1-2: `**........`) and row 10 (columns 2-3: `.**.......`).\n- **Current Block Rotations**:\n  - **0°**: 2 rows high, 3 columns wide (`*00` in row 1, `***` in row 2).\n  - **90°**: 3 rows high, 2 columns wide (`**` in row 1, `*0` in row 2, `*0` in row 3).\n  - **180°**: 2 rows high, 3 columns wide (`***` in row 1, `00*` in row 2).\n  - **270°**: 3 rows high, 2 columns wide (`0*` in row 1, `0*` in row 2, `**` in row 3).\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The goal is to place the block as low as possible. We prioritize rotations and coordinates that allow the block to land closest to the existing blocks or the bottom of the board.\n- The 180° rotation of the block is analyzed for its potential to land lower. The 180° shape has a top row (`***`) covering 3 columns and a bottom row (`00*`) covering 1 column (column 3 when the leftmost coordinate is 1).\n\n### Placement of 180° Rotation at Drop Coordinate 1:\n- **Drop Coordinate (x=1)**: The block’s leftmost column is 1, covering columns 1-3 in the top row and column 3 in the bottom row.\n- **Landing Row**: The block falls until it hits existing blocks or the bottom. The bottom row of the 180° shape (`00*`, column 3) can land in row 9 (since column 3 in row 9 is empty). The top row (`***`, columns 1-3) will occupy row 8 (empty).\n\n### Validation:\n- No overlap with existing blocks: Row 9 has `**........` (columns 1-2 filled), and the block’s bottom row (column 3) is empty in row 9. Row 8 is entirely empty, so the top row of the block (`***`, columns 1-3) does not overlap.\n- The block lands as low as possible (row 9 for the bottom row, row 8 for the top row).\n\nAnswer: 1 180","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block. The board has existing blocks in columns 1-3 (rows 7-9) and is otherwise empty. The current block is an I-block, which can be horizontal (0° or 180°: 4 columns wide, 1 row tall) or vertical (90° or 270°: 1 column wide, 4 rows tall).\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Horizontal I-block (0°\/180°)**: Occupies 4 consecutive columns. To land, it needs the lowest possible row where its columns are unobstructed. Columns 7-10 are entirely empty, so placing the horizontal block here will let it fall to the bottom (row 9).\n2. **Vertical I-block (90°\/270°)**: Occupies 4 consecutive rows in a single column. While vertical placement is possible in empty columns (e.g., column 4), it does not provide a lower landing row than horizontal placement in columns 7-10.\n3. **Goal**: Maximize low placement to avoid building height. Placing the horizontal block in columns 7-10 (leftmost coordinate 7) at rotation 0° lands it at row 9, the lowest possible position.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best action is to place the horizontal I-block (0° rotation) at leftmost coordinate 7, where it lands at the bottom row (row 9) without overlapping existing blocks.\n\nAnswer: 7 0","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations.

The middle columns (4-6) are empty across all rows, making them a good target for placement to balance the board.\n\n### Block Rotations:\n- **0° and 180°**: 3 columns wide (shape: `**0`\/`0**`), 2 rows tall. Occupies columns (x, x+1, x+2) and rows (a, a+1).\n- **90° and 270°**: 2 columns wide (shape: `0*`\/`**`\/`*0`), 3 rows tall. Occupies columns (x, x+1) and rows (a, a+1, a+2).\n\n### Optimal Placement:\nFor the 0° rotation (3 columns wide), placing the block in the middle (columns 4-6) avoids existing blocks and fills empty space. The leftmost column (drop coordinate) is 4, ensuring the block spans columns 4-6. \n\n- **Landing Check**: The block (2 rows tall) falls to rows 9 and 10 (bottom rows). Row 9 (columns 4-5) and row 10 (columns 5-6) are empty, so the block lands without overlapping existing blocks.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the 0° rotation at drop coordinate 4 (leftmost column 4) is optimal, as it fills the middle empty columns and stabilizes the board.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block. The block is a 2x2 square (all rotations are identical), so rotation angle does not affect its shape.

However, placing the block in columns 1-3 (x=1, 2, 3) would overlap with existing blocks in row 7 (columns 1-3 are already filled). Thus, valid coordinates are x=4 to x=9.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **x=4**: Covers columns 4-5. Rows 7 and 8 in columns 4-5 are mostly empty (row 7: columns 4-5 are `.`, row 8: columns 4-5 are `*` but the block can land above row 8). Placing the block here fills row 7, columns 4-5, extending the filled region in row 7 to columns 1-5 (aligning with row 8’s filled columns 1-5). This helps build a more uniform stack, aiding future line clears.\n\n### Rotation Angle:\nSince all rotations of the block are identical, any rotation angle (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) is valid. We choose 0° for simplicity.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands without exceeding the top boundary and maximizes potential line clears.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 rows (0-based, top to bottom). Key observations about filled columns:\n- Columns 0-2: Filled from row 7 downward.\n- Columns 3-4: Filled from row 6 downward.\n- Columns 5-9: Filled only in row 9 (bottom row).\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe block has four rotations. We focus on 0° (most straightforward for filling lower columns):\n- **0° Rotation**: Shape is 3 columns wide (columns x-1, x, x+1 in 0-based) and 2 rows tall. The block occupies:\n  - Row 0 (top of block): Column x-1.\n  - Row 1 (bottom of block): Columns x-1, x, x+1.\n\n### Placement Strategy:\nWe aim to place the block in columns 0-2 (1-based x=1), where the highest filled rows are at row 7. This ensures the block lands stably without overlapping existing blocks. The block will fall until its bottom row (row 1 of the block) lands on row 6 (just above the filled rows in columns 0-2).\n\n### Validation:\n- **Drop Coordinate (x=1)**: Leftmost column of the block is column 1 (1-based), covering columns 0-2 (0-based).\n- **Rotation (0°)**: The block’s shape fits columns 0-2 without exceeding the board’s top boundary.\n- **Landing Position**: The block lands at rows 5 (top row of the block) and 6 (bottom row of the block) in columns 0-2, filling empty spaces without overlapping existing blocks.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands as low as possible without causing a game over and ideally sets up for future line clears. \n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 rows (0-9, top to bottom) and 10 columns (1-10, left to right). Key observations:\n- Rows 6-8 (bottom-middle) have columns 1-5 filled (`*****.....`).\n- Row 9 (bottom row) has columns 2-3 and 5-10 filled (`.**.******`), leaving columns 1 and 4 empty.\n- Rows 0-5 are mostly empty, with only row 5 having a single filled cell in column 1 (`*.........`).\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe block has two distinct rotations:\n1. **0°\/180°**: 3 columns wide, 2 rows tall, with cells at `(r, c+1), (r, c+2), (r+1, c), (r+1, c+1)`.\n2. **90°\/270°**: 2 columns wide, 3 rows tall, with cells at `(r, c), (r+1, c), (r+1, c+1), (r+2, c+1)`.\n\n### Strategy:\nSince no immediate line clear is possible (row 9 needs 2 more cells, but the block has 4 cells), we prioritize placing the block in a low position to avoid stacking high and to set up for future moves. The 90° rotation (2 columns wide) is more versatile for filling gaps in the lower rows.\n\n### Optimal Placement:\n- **Rotation**: 90° (2 columns wide, fits well in narrower gaps).\n- **Drop Coordinate**: 4 (columns 4-5, aligns with the empty columns in the lower rows and avoids overlapping with existing filled cells).\n\n### Validation:\nPlacing the 90° block at column 4:\n- Cells occupy `(r, 4), (r+1, 4), (r+1, 5), (r+2, 5)`.\n- The highest filled rows in columns 4 and 5 are row 6. The block falls until `r+2 < 6`, so `r = 3`.\n- This places the block in rows 3-5, columns 4-5, which are all empty, ensuring a valid landing.\n\nAnswer: 4 90","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board, the falling block's rotations, and potential placements to avoid holes and build toward line clears. \n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 rows, with the bottom rows (rows 7-10) showing significant filling:\n- **Row 10**: `.**.******` (columns 2, 3, 6-10 filled; columns 1, 4, 5 empty).\n- **Rows 7-9**: `*****.....` (columns 1-5 filled; columns 6-10 empty).\n- **Rows 4-6**: Sparse filling (e.g., row 4: `...*......`; row 5: `...**.....`; row 6: `*...*.....`).\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe current block has two unique rotations:\n- **0°\/180°**: 3 columns wide, shape:  \n  `**0`  \n  `0**`  \n  Occupies columns \\(x, x+1\\) (top row) and \\(x+1, x+2\\) (bottom row).  \n- **90°\/270°**: 2 columns wide, shape:  \n  `0*`  \n  `**`  \n  `*0`  \n  Occupies columns \\(x\\) (bottom row), \\(x, x+1\\) (middle row), and \\(x+1\\) (top row).\n\n### Key Observations:\n- Row 10 needs 2 more filled cells (columns 1, 4, 5) to clear, but the block’s 4 cells cannot fill these gaps without overlapping existing filled cells.\n- Rows 7-9 have a solid left stack (columns 1-5), so placing the block to extend this stack without creating holes is prioritized.\n\n### Optimal Placement:\nFor **0° rotation** (3 columns wide), placing the block at \\(x=2\\) (leftmost column 2) aligns with the left stack and avoids holes:\n- **Block shape at 0°**: Occupies columns 2, 3 (top row) and 3, 4 (bottom row).\n- **Landing position**: The block falls until it hits the existing stack. It lands at row \\(y=5\\) (top row of the block at row 5, bottom row at row 6), as lower rows (7-9) are already filled in columns 2-4.\n- **Result**: Fills columns 2, 3 (row 5) and 3, 4 (row 6), extending the left stack without creating gaps.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the block at \\(x=2\\) with 0° rotation is the safest and most strategic move, avoiding holes and building toward future line clears.\n\nAnswer: 2 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board, block rotations, and existing column heights. The goal is to place the block such that it minimizes height differences between columns and avoids exacerbating existing high stacks.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has columns with varying heights (topmost filled row):\n- Columns 1: Height 6 (row 6)\n- Columns 2-3: Height 2 (row 2)\n- Column 4: Height 3 (row 3)\n- Column 5: Height 5 (row 5)\n- Columns 6-10: Height 10 (row 10, bottom row)\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe current block has four rotations. We focus on the 0° rotation, which has the shape:\n```\n*00\n***\n```\nThis rotation covers 3 columns (width 3) and 2 rows (height 2). The * positions are: (x, y), (x, y+1), (x+1, y+1), (x+2, y+1).\n\n### Placement Strategy:\nColumns 6-10 are already at height 10 (bottom row), so adding to these columns would worsen the stack. Instead, we aim to reduce height differences by placing the block in columns 4-6, which have higher existing heights but can be lowered by adding blocks in upper rows.\n\n### Optimal Placement:\nFor the 0° rotation at drop coordinate \\( x = 4 \\) (columns 4, 5, 6):\n- Column 4: Existing height 3. Placing a * in row 1 (top row of the block) and row 2 (bottom row) lowers its height to 1.\n- Column 5: Existing height 5. Placing a * in row 2 lowers its height to 2.\n- Column 6: Existing height 10. Placing a * in row 2 lowers its height to 2.\n\nThis placement balances column heights and avoids adding to the already critical columns 6-10.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board, the falling block's rotations, and potential landing positions. The goal is to place the block such that it lands without exceeding the top boundary and ideally sets up for future row clears. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Board State**: The board has no fully filled rows (score=0). Row 10 is the closest to being full with 8 filled cells (missing columns 1 and 4), but no rotation of the current block can fill these gaps.\n2. **Block Rotations**: The block has four rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°). We need to check which rotation and drop coordinate allow the block to land without collision.\n\n### Analysis of Rotations:\n- **0° Rotation**: 2 rows high, 3 columns wide. Cells are `*00` (top row) and `***` (bottom row). Testing drop coordinates 1-8 shows collisions in most columns due to existing blocks.\n- **90° Rotation**: 3 rows high, 2 columns wide. Cells are `**`, `*0`, `*0` (top to bottom). This rotation fits in columns 6-7 (leftmost column 6) without collision, as columns 6-7 are mostly empty in upper rows.\n- **180° Rotation**: 2 rows high, 3 columns wide. Cells are `***` (top row) and `00*` (bottom row). Collisions occur in most columns due to existing blocks.\n- **270° Rotation**: 3 rows high, 2 columns wide. Cells are `0*`, `0*`, `**` (top to bottom). Limited space in columns due to existing blocks.\n\n### Optimal Placement:\nThe 90° rotation (3 rows high, 2 columns wide) placed at drop coordinate 6 (columns 6-7) is valid. The block lands in rows 7-9 without collision, filling cells (7,6), (7,7), (8,6), (9,6). This placement avoids immediate game over and positions the block to potentially aid future row clears.\n\nAnswer: 6 90"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The current block is a 2x2 square (all rotations are identical), so the rotation angle does not affect its shape. The goal is to choose a valid drop coordinate (leftmost column) and rotation angle.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Block Shape**: The block is a 2x2 square, meaning it occupies 2 columns and 2 rows regardless of rotation. All rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) are identical.\n2. **Board Dimensions**: The board has 10 columns. Since the block is 2 columns wide, the leftmost drop coordinate can range from 1 to 9 (inclusive) to ensure the block fits within the board.\n3. **Empty Board**: The board is completely empty, so the block will fall to the bottom, occupying rows 9 and 10 (top to bottom) when placed.\n\n### Action Selection:\nSince all rotations are identical, any rotation angle (e.g., 0°) is valid. For the drop coordinate, placing the block in the middle of the board (column 5) is a reasonable choice, as it centers the block and leaves balanced space on both sides for future moves.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block. The board has existing blocks in rows 9 and 10, columns 5-6 (denoted by `**`). The current block is a 2x2 square (O tetromino), which is rotationally symmetric (all rotations are identical). \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Block Shape and Rotation**: The block is 2x2, so rotating it (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) does not change its shape. Thus, rotation angle has no impact on placement.\n2. **Drop Coordinate**: The block occupies 2 columns, so the leftmost drop coordinate (`x`) ranges from 1 to 9 (since `x+1` must not exceed column 10).\n3. **Landing Position**: The block falls until it hits existing blocks or the bottom of the board. For the existing blocks in rows 9-10 (columns 5-6), dropping the block in column 5 (leftmost coordinate 5) aligns it with the existing vertical stack. This positions the block to land in rows 7-8 (columns 5-6), as it cannot fall further due to the existing blocks in row 9.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the block at drop coordinate 5 with any rotation (since all rotations are identical) is optimal. Here, we choose rotation 0° for simplicity.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations.

Columns 1-4 and 7-10 are mostly empty.\n- **Block Rotations**: The block has four rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°).

Columns 5 and 6 have filled cells starting at row 3. The block’s bottom row (row \\(y+1\\)) must be placed just above row 3 to avoid overlap. Thus, \\(y+1=2\\) (row 2), so \\(y=1\\) (row 1).\n- **Validity**: The cells (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), and (7,2) are all empty on the board, ensuring no overlap.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the 0° rotation at column 5 (leftmost) allows the block to land securely in rows 1 and 2, filling empty spaces in columns 5-7 without overlapping existing blocks.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations.

Columns 1-4 and 8-10 are mostly empty. The current block has two unique rotations: 0°\/180° (3 columns wide, 2 rows tall) and 90°\/270° (2 columns wide, 3 rows tall).\n\n### 0° Rotation (3 columns wide)\nThe 0° rotation has the shape:\n```\n**0\n0**\n```\nThis block spans 3 columns and 2 rows. To place it as low as possible, we target the rightmost columns (8-10), which are empty. The leftmost coordinate (x) for a 3-column block ranges from 1 to 8 (since 8 + 3 - 1 = 10, the rightmost column).\n\n#### Placement at x=8 (columns 8-10)\n- The block occupies columns 8, 9, and 10.\n- The board’s columns 8-10 are empty in all rows, allowing the block to fall to the bottom.\n- The block lands at rows 8 and 9 (top row of the block = 8, bottom row = 9), as these are the lowest rows where the block does not overlap existing blocks.\n\n### 90° Rotation (2 columns wide)\nThe 90° rotation has the shape:\n```\n0*\n**\n*0\n```\nThis block spans 2 columns and 3 rows. While it can be placed in empty columns (e.g., 8-9), it requires 3 rows of vertical space. However, placing it in columns 8-9 would land it higher (rows 7-9) compared to the 0° rotation’s placement in rows 8-9, making the 0° rotation more optimal.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe best action is to place the 0°-rotated block at x=8 (leftmost column 8), allowing it to land at the lowest possible rows (8 and 9) without overlapping existing blocks.\n\nAnswer: 8 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands as low as possible, avoids game over, and sets up for future line clears.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has existing blocks concentrated in columns 5-10, with columns 1-4 mostly empty. The highest occupied rows (topmost '*') in columns 1-4 are at row 10 (completely empty), while columns 5-10 have blocks starting from row 1 (column 5) up to row 9 (column 10).\n\n### Block Rotations:\n- **0° and 180° rotations**: Horizontal line (****), 4 columns wide, 1 row high.\n- **90° and 270° rotations**: Vertical line (four stacked '*'), 1 column wide, 4 rows high.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Horizontal Block (0°\/180°)**: Placing this in columns 1-4 (leftmost columns) allows it to fall to the bottom row (row 9) since these columns are empty. This maximizes the block's placement height and avoids creating holes.\n- **Vertical Block (90°\/270°)**: Placing this in empty columns (1-4) would fill rows 6-9, but this creates a tall column, which is less optimal for future line clears. Placing it in occupied columns (5-10) would cause the block to exceed the top boundary (game over).\n\n### Optimal Move:\nPlacing the horizontal block (0° rotation) in the leftmost possible column (drop coordinate 1) allows it to land at the bottom row (row 9), filling columns 1-4.

The goal is to place the block as low as possible without overlapping existing blocks and to avoid topping out. \n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 columns (1-10) and 10 rows (0-9, top to bottom). The leftmost columns (1-3) are mostly empty in rows 0-8, making them ideal for placing the block to avoid stacking in already filled columns (4-5). \n\n### Block Rotations:\n- **0° and 180°**: The block is 2 rows high and 3 columns wide, with cells at positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2) relative to the top-left corner.\n- **90° and 270°**: The block is 3 rows high and 2 columns wide, with cells at positions (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0) relative to the top-left corner.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- Placing the block in the leftmost columns (1-3) avoids the densely filled columns (4-5) and allows the block to fall deeper.\n- The 0° rotation (2 rows high) can land lower than the 90° rotation (3 rows high) in the left columns.\n\n### Optimal Placement:\nFor the 0° rotation (2 rows high, 3 columns wide), placing the block at drop coordinate 1 (leftmost column 1) allows it to occupy columns 1, 2, and 3. The block will fall until it hits the bottom or existing blocks. \n\n- **Landing Check**: The block’s cells are (y,1), (y,2), (y+1,2), (y+1,3). The highest filled row in columns 1-3 is row 9 (bottom row). The block can fall to row 7 (y=7), as row 8 and 9 in columns 1-3 are empty except for row 9, which is filled.

Existing blocks are marked with `*`, and empty spaces with `.`.\n- **Current Block Rotations**: The block has four rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°). We need to evaluate each rotation and possible drop coordinates to find a valid landing position.\n\n### Key Observations\n- **Existing Blocks**: Most filled cells are concentrated in columns 5–6 and 9–10 across lower rows (rows 7–10). Upper rows (rows 1–6) have sparse blocks, particularly in columns 1–4 and 7–8.\n- **Rotation 180°**: This rotation has a 3-column width (columns 1–3 in local coordinates) and 2 rows.

This positions the block to fill:\n- (7, Y) and (8, Y) in row Y,\n- (7, Y+1) in row Y+1,\n- (7, Y+2) in row Y+2.\n\n### Landing Check:\nFor X=7, the block lands at Y=7 (lowest valid row) without overlapping existing blocks. This fills columns 7-8 in row 7, column 7 in row 8, and column 7 in row 9, addressing key gaps.\n\nAnswer: 7 90"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The current block is a 2x2 square (denoted by '**' in a 2x2 grid) with all rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) being identical. Since the board is initially empty (all rows are '.'), the block will fall to the bottom of the board regardless of the drop position, as there are no existing blocks to obstruct it.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Block Shape**: The block is a 2x2 square, so all rotations are identical. Thus, the rotation angle does not affect the block's shape.\n2. **Drop Coordinate**: The block spans 2 columns. The leftmost coordinate must be between 1 and 9 (inclusive) to ensure the block fits within the 10-column board (since 9 + 2 - 1 = 10, the rightmost column).\n3. **Empty Board**: Since the board is empty, the block will fall to the bottom row (row 10) and occupy rows 9 and 10 (assuming rows are numbered from top to bottom).\n\n### Action Selection:\nGiven the block's shape and the empty board, any valid drop coordinate (1-9) and rotation (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) is acceptable. For simplicity, we choose a middle position (column 5) and the default rotation (0°).\n\nAnswer: 5 0","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board, existing blocks, and the falling block's rotations. The board has 10 columns, with existing blocks in rows 8 and 9 (0-based) at columns 4 and 5 (0-based, corresponding to 5 and 6 in 1-based). The goal is to place the block such that it lands without exceeding the top boundary and aligns to build toward future line clears.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Existing Blocks**: Rows 8 and 9 (0-based) have `**` in columns 4-5 (0-based), creating a vertical stack in columns 4-5.\n2. **Current Block Rotations**:\n   - **0° and 180°**: 3 columns wide, shape `**0` (top row) and `0**` (bottom row).\n   - **90° and 270°**: 2 columns wide, shape `0*` (top row), `**` (middle row), `*0` (bottom row).\n\n### Analysis of 0° Rotation (3 Columns Wide):\n- The 0° block has cells at (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2) (block coordinates). Placing it with a leftmost column (1-based) of 5 (0-based 4) means the block spans columns 4-6 (0-based).\n- **Landing Position**: The block falls until it hits existing blocks or the bottom. The height map shows columns 4-5 (0-based) have existing blocks at row 8 (0-based), while columns 6 (0-based) are empty (height 9). The block lands at row 6 (0-based top row of the block), with cells at (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6) (0-based board coordinates). This positions the block adjacent to the existing stack, minimizing holes and aligning for future line clears.\n\n### Validation:\n- The block does not exceed the top boundary (row 6 is well below row 0).\n- No full rows are cleared (existing rows have 2 blocks each, and the new block adds 4, totaling 6 per row).\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the 0° rotation at leftmost column 5 (1-based) is optimal, as it aligns with the existing stack and avoids creating gaps.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block. The board has existing blocks in rows 6-9, primarily in columns 4-6. The current block is a straight line, which can be horizontal (0° or 180°: ****) or vertical (90° or 270°: four stacked *). \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Horizontal Block (0°\/180°)**: The block spans 4 columns. To land without exceeding the top, we need a leftmost coordinate (1-10) such that the block fits within the board (columns 1-10). For example, a leftmost coordinate of 5 (1-based) places the block in columns 4-7 (0-based). The block will fall until it hits existing blocks or the bottom. \n2. **Landing Position**: In columns 4-7, the highest existing blocks are in row 6 (columns 4-5) and row 7 (column 6). The block will land in row 5 (just above these obstacles), occupying row 5, columns 4-7. This placement is valid and does not exceed the top boundary.\n3. **Vertical Block (90°\/270°)**: While vertical placement is possible, it does not immediately clear rows or optimize the board better than horizontal placement in this scenario.\n\n### Chosen Action:\nPlacing the horizontal block (0° rotation) at leftmost coordinate 5 ensures a valid landing without exceeding the top boundary. \n\nAnswer: 5 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands without exceeding the top boundary and ideally sets up for future line clears. \n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has existing blocks concentrated in columns 4-7 (rows 5-9). Columns 0-3 and 8-9 are mostly empty. The highest filled row is row 5 (columns 4-7), with sparser blocks in lower rows (rows 6-9).\n\n### Block Rotations:\n- **0°**: 3 columns wide (shape: `00*` over `***`), 2 rows tall.\n- **90°**: 2 columns wide (shape: `*0` over `*0` over `**`), 3 rows tall.\n- **180°**: 3 columns wide (shape: `***` over `*00`), 2 rows tall.\n- **270°**: 2 columns wide (shape: `**` over `0*` over `0*`), 3 rows tall.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The block must land without exceeding the top boundary (row 0).\n- Placing the block in columns 4-6 (near existing blocks) helps fill gaps and avoid creating high stacks.\n- The 0° rotation (3 columns wide) fits well in columns 4-6, aligning with the existing blocks in row 5.\n\n### Simulation for 0° Rotation at x=5:\n- **Drop Coordinate**: x=5 (leftmost column 5, covering columns 4-6 on the board).\n- **Landing Position**: The block falls until it hits the highest existing block in columns 4-6 (row 5). The top row of the block (row 3) and bottom row (row 4) are within the board, avoiding the top boundary.\n- **Result**: The block lands at row 3 (top) and row 4 (bottom), filling cells (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). No lines are cleared immediately, but it safely integrates with existing blocks.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the 0° rotation at x=5 is optimal, as it avoids exceeding the top boundary and aligns with existing blocks to minimize future stacking issues.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block. The board has 10 columns (1-10) and 10 rows (0-9, top to bottom). The current block is an I-block with two distinct rotations: horizontal (0°\/180°) and vertical (90°\/270°). \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Horizontal Block (0°\/180°)**: A 4-square horizontal line (width 4, height 1). It lands when any of its 4 columns hits an existing block or the bottom.\n2. **Vertical Block (90°\/270°)**: A 4-square vertical line (width 1, height 4). It lands when its bottom square hits an existing block or the bottom.\n\n### Analysis of Horizontal Placement (0°):\nFor the horizontal block, we need to find the leftmost column (drop coordinate) where it can land as low as possible. Columns 1-4 (1-based) are mostly empty (no blocks in rows 0-9), so the block can fall to the bottom row (row 9, 0-based). \n\n- **Drop Coordinate 1 (columns 1-4)**: The block covers columns 1-4 (1-based). Since these columns have no existing blocks, the block lands at row 9 (bottom row). This placement fills row 9, columns 1-4, with no immediate line clears but avoids unnecessary height buildup.\n\n### Analysis of Vertical Placement (90°):\nThe vertical block (4 rows high) requires 4 consecutive empty rows in a single column. Most columns have existing blocks, and even in empty columns (e.g., column 1), placing the vertical block would occupy rows 6-9 (0-based), which does not clear lines and builds height unnecessarily.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the horizontal block (0° rotation) at drop coordinate 1 (leftmost column 1) lands it at the bottom row (row 9), minimizing height and setting up the board for future moves.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","\nTo solve this Tetris problem, we need to determine the optimal placement (drop coordinate and rotation) for the current block such that it lands without overlapping existing blocks and maximizes the potential for future line clears. \n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Board State**: The board has 10 rows (top to bottom) and 10 columns. The highest filled rows in each column (from top to bottom) are:\n   - Columns 0-3: Filled at row 9 (bottom row).\n   - Column 4: Filled at row 4.\n   - Column 5: Filled at row 4.\n   - Column 6: Filled at row 3.\n   - Column 7: Filled at row 5.\n   - Columns 8-9: Empty (no filled rows).\n\n2. **Current Block**: The block has two unique rotations:\n   - **0°\/180°**: Shape is `**0` (top row) and `0**` (bottom row), covering 3 columns and 2 rows.\n   - **90°\/270°**: Shape is `0*` (top row), `**` (middle row), `*0` (bottom row), covering 2 columns and 3 rows.\n\n3. **Goal**: Place the block such that it lands without overlapping existing blocks and fits as low as possible to avoid filling the top rows prematurely.\n\n### Optimal Placement:\nFor the 0° rotation (same as 180°), the block covers 3 columns. Testing drop coordinate `7` (1-based, columns 6-8 in 0-based indexing):\n- The block’s shape in 0° is `**0` (top row: columns 6-7) and `0**` (bottom row: columns 7-8).\n- The block falls until it hits existing blocks or the bottom. Simulating the fall, the block lands at row 2 (top row of the block), with its bottom row at row 3.\n- This placement avoids overlapping existing blocks and fits neatly into columns 6-8, which are mostly empty, minimizing gaps.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe optimal action is to place the block at drop coordinate `7` with a rotation of `0°`.\n\nAnswer: 7 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the possible rotations of the falling block. The goal is to place the block in a position that minimizes height increase and sets up for future line clears. \n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has gaps in columns 1-4 (mostly empty above row 10) and existing blocks in columns 5-9. Key rows with blocks include:\n- Row 10: `******....` (columns 1-6 filled)\n- Row 9: `....**....` (columns 5-6 filled)\n- Row 8: `.....**...` (columns 6-7 filled)\n- Row 7: `....**....` (columns 5-6 filled)\n- Row 6: `....****..` (columns 5-8 filled)\n- Row 5: `....***...` (columns 5-7 filled)\n- Row 4: `......***.` (columns 7-9 filled)\n- Row 3: `......**..` (columns 7-8 filled)\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe block has four rotations:\n- **0°**: 3 columns wide, shape `0*0` (top row) and `***` (bottom row).\n- **90°**: 2 columns wide, shape `*0`, `**`, `*0` (3 rows).\n- **180°**: 3 columns wide, shape `***` (top row) and `0*0` (bottom row).\n- **270°**: 2 columns wide, shape `0*`, `**`, `0*` (3 rows).\n\n### Strategy:\nThe 270° rotation (2 columns wide) fits well into the gap between columns 5-6, where existing blocks are clustered. Placing it at `x=5` (leftmost column 5) aligns with the existing blocks in columns 5-6, filling gaps and minimizing height increase.\n\n### Placement Check for 270° at x=5:\n- **Block Shape (270°)**: Cells are `(y,6)`, `(y+1,5)`, `(y+1,6)`, `(y+2,6)` (columns 5-6).\n- **Landing Position**: The block falls until it hits existing blocks. For `x=5`, the highest empty row where the block can land without overlapping is `y=3`.\n  - `(3,6)`: Empty (row 3, column 6).\n  - `(4,5)`: Empty (row 4, column 5).\n  - `(4,6)`: Empty (row 4, column 6).\n  - `(5,6)`: Filled (row 5, column 6, part of existing `***`).\n\n### Outcome:\nPlacing the 270° rotation at `x=5` fills gaps in columns 5-6, aligning with existing blocks and setting up for potential future line clears.\n\nAnswer: 5 270","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands without exceeding the top boundary and ideally positions blocks to potentially clear lines in future moves.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 rows (top to bottom: rows 1–10). Key occupied columns in lower rows include:\n- Row 10: Columns 1–6 filled.\n- Row 9: Columns 5–6 filled.\n- Row 8: Columns 6–7 filled.\n- Row 7: Columns 5–6 filled.\n- Row 6: Columns 5–8 filled.\n- Row 5: Columns 5–7 filled.\n- Row 4: Columns 6–9 filled.\n- Row 3: Columns 5–8 filled.\n- Row 2: Column 6 filled.\n- Row 1: All empty.\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe block has four rotations:\n- **0°\/180°**: 2 rows × 3 columns, shape:  \n  Row 1: `0**`  \n  Row 2: `**0`  \n- **90°\/270°**: 3 rows × 2 columns, shape:  \n  Row 1: `*0`  \n  Row 2: `**`  \n  Row 3: `0*`  \n\n### Strategy:\nWe need a valid drop coordinate (1–10) and rotation (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) where the block lands without exceeding the top boundary. The 90° rotation (3 rows × 2 columns) is promising due to its vertical orientation, allowing placement in columns with fewer existing blocks.\n\n### Valid Placement:\nFor the 90° rotation (3 rows × 2 columns), consider **x=3** (leftmost column 3, covering columns 3–4). The block’s cells are:\n- Row \\( r-2 \\): Column 3 (top of the block).\n- Row \\( r-1 \\): Columns 3 and 4 (middle of the block).\n- Row \\( r \\): Column 4 (bottom of the block).\n\nChecking from the bottom up, the block can land at \\( r=9 \\) (bottom row 9), with:\n- \\( r-2=7 \\): Row 7, column 3 (empty).\n- \\( r-1=8 \\): Row 8, columns 3 and 4 (empty).\n- \\( r=9 \\): Row 9, column 4 (empty).\n\nThis placement is valid, as all cells are unoccupied, and the block does not exceed the top boundary.\n\nAnswer: 3 90","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board, the falling block's rotations, and potential landing positions. The goal is to place the block such that it lands stably and ideally contributes to clearing a row (though no rows can be fully cleared in this scenario).\n\n### Board Analysis\nThe board has existing blocks concentrated in the lower to middle rows.

The block’s bottom row (`***`) can land here.\n- **Top row (A row)**: Column 9 in row 9 is empty (row 9 has columns 4-6 filled). The block’s top row (`00*`) places a block in column 9 of row 9.\n\n### Outcome\nPlacing the 0° rotation at \\(x = 7\\) lands the block stably in rows 9 and 10, filling columns 7-9 of row 10 and column 9 of row 9.

The goal is to place the block such that it lands without overlapping existing blocks and ideally sets up for future line clears.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Existing Blocks**: Row 9 has `....**....` (columns 5-6), and row 10 has `...**.....` (columns 4-5).\n2. **Block Rotations**: The current block has four rotations. We focus on the 0° rotation, which has a 2-row height and a 3-column width, making it suitable for filling gaps.\n\n### Analysis of 0° Rotation:\nThe 0° rotation shape is:\n```\n*00\n***\n```\nThis means the block spans 3 columns (leftmost column `x`, `x+1`, `x+2` in the bottom row) and 2 rows (top row has a single star at column `x`).\n\n### Placement for 0° Rotation:\n- **Leftmost Column (x=3)**: The block spans columns 3, 4, 5. The block falls until it hits existing blocks or the bottom. The highest existing blocks are in row 9 (column 5) and row 10 (columns 4-5). \n- **Landing Position**: The block lands with its top row at row 7 and bottom row at row 8. This placement avoids overlapping existing blocks (row 7 and 8 are initially empty) and positions the block low in the stack.\n\n### Validation:\n- The block’s squares at (7,3), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5) are all empty on the current board, ensuring no collisions.\n- This placement keeps the stack height low, facilitating future line clears.\n\nAnswer: 3 0","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands as low as possible without exceeding the top boundary, while considering future line-clearing potential.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 rows (top to bottom: rows 1–10). The highest existing blocks are in row 7 (column 3), row 8 (columns 3–5), row 9 (columns 5–6), and row 10 (columns 4–5). The remaining rows (1–6) are empty.\n\n### Current Block Rotations:\n- **0°\/180°**: 2x3 block with shape:  \n  `**0`  \n  `0**`  \n  (covers 3 columns, height 2)  \n- **90°\/270°**: 3x2 block with shape:  \n  `0*`  \n  `**`  \n  `*0`  \n  (covers 2 columns, height 3)  \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **0°\/180°** (width 3): Can be placed in columns 1–8. For example, placing at column 3 would cover columns 3–5. However, the block would land in rows 6–7 due to existing blocks in row 7 (column 3) and row 8 (columns 4–5).  \n- **90°\/270°** (width 2): Can be placed in columns 1–9. Placing at column 4 (covering columns 4–5) avoids immediate collisions with existing blocks and lands in rows 5–7, as the highest obstructions in columns 4–5 are in row 8.  \n\n### Optimal Action:\nPlacing the **90°-rotated block** at **column 4** ensures the block lands stably in rows 5–7, covering columns 4–5 without overlapping existing blocks. This position avoids exceeding the top boundary and sets up potential for future line clears.\n\nAnswer: 4 90","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board, existing block positions, and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to find a valid drop coordinate and rotation where the block lands without overlapping existing blocks.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 columns (1-10) and 10 rows (0-9, top to bottom). Existing blocks are concentrated in columns 3-6 of rows 4-9. The highest occupied rows per column are:\n- Columns 1-2, 7-10: No blocks (highest at row 10, bottom).\n- Column 3: Row 6.\n- Column 4: Row 5.\n- Column 5: Row 4.\n- Column 6: Row 8.\n\n### Current Block Rotations:\nThe block has four rotations. We focus on the 90° rotation, which is 2 columns wide (columns \\(x\\) and \\(x+1\\)) and 3 rows tall. Its shape is:\n```\n**\n*0\n*0\n```\nThis means the block occupies:\n- Row 0: Columns \\(x\\) and \\(x+1\\).\n- Row 1: Column \\(x\\).\n- Row 2: Column \\(x\\).\n\n### Valid Placement for 90° Rotation at \\(x=3\\):\n- **Columns**: \\(x=3\\) (columns 3 and 4).\n- **Landing Calculation**: The block falls until it hits existing blocks or the bottom. For columns 3 and 4:\n  - Column 3: Highest block at row 6. The block’s rows 0, 1, 2 must land above row 6.\n  - Column 4: Highest block at row 5. The block’s row 0 must land above row 5.\n- **Landing Row**: The maximum \\(y\\) (lowest row) where the block fits is \\(y=3\\). This places the block in rows 3 (columns 3-4), 4 (column 3), and 5 (column 3), avoiding overlaps with existing blocks.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the 90°-rotated block at column 3 is valid and avoids collisions.\n\nAnswer: 3 90","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block. The board has existing blocks in columns 2-5 (rows 3-9), with gaps in higher rows. The current block is an I-block, which can be horizontal (0°\/180°) or vertical (90°\/270°). \n\n### Horizontal Block (0°\/180°):\nThe horizontal I-block (****) spans 4 columns. We need to find a position where it lands without exceeding the top boundary. Key observations:\n- Columns 0-1 and 6-9 are mostly empty (highest occupied row = 10).\n- Columns 2-3 have blocks starting at row 3, column 4 at row 4, and column 5 at row 8.\n- For a horizontal block placed at leftmost coordinate \\( x = 3 \\) (1-based), it covers columns 2-5 (0-based). The highest occupied rows in these columns are 3 (columns 2-3), 4 (column 4), and 8 (column 5). The block lands at row \\( \\text{min}(3-1, 3-1, 4-1, 8-1) = 2 \\), filling row 2, columns 2-5. This avoids gaps and positions the block lower in the board.\n\n### Vertical Block (90°\/270°):\nThe vertical I-block (4 rows tall) is less optimal here. Placing it in columns with existing blocks (e.g., columns 2-3) would cause the block to exceed the top boundary (game over). In empty columns, it fills isolated columns without contributing to line clears.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe horizontal block placed at \\( x = 3 \\) (1-based) with rotation 0° is a safe and strategic move, filling row 2, columns 2-5, and avoiding game-ending positions.\n\nAnswer: 3 0","\nTo solve this Tetris problem, we analyze the current game board and the falling block to determine the optimal placement. The current block is a 2x2 square (all rotations are identical), so the rotation angle does not affect the block's shape. The goal is to place the block such that it lands as low as possible to avoid raising the stack height excessively.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Block Characteristics**: The block is a 2x2 square, so it occupies 2 rows and 2 columns regardless of rotation.\n2. **Board Analysis**: The board has empty columns on the far left (columns 1-2, 0-based) and far right (columns 8-9, 0-based). Existing blocks are concentrated in the middle columns (2-5, 0-based).\n3. **Landing Position**: The block will fall until it hits the bottom of the board or existing blocks. For columns with no existing blocks (e.g., the far left), the block will land at the bottom row (row 9, 0-based), occupying rows 8 and 9.\n\n### Optimal Action:\nPlacing the block in the leftmost column (x=1, 1-based) ensures it lands at the bottom of the board, minimizing the increase in stack height. Since all rotations are identical, any rotation angle (e.g., 0°) is valid.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's possible rotations and positions. The goal is to place the block such that it lands stably without exceeding the board's top boundary and ideally fills gaps or builds up the board evenly.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe board has filled columns primarily in the left-middle (columns 1-2, 3-6) and empty columns on the right (columns 7-10). Rows 0-1 are entirely empty, rows 2-9 have partial fills, and no rows are fully occupied (so no lines can be cleared immediately).\n\n### Current Block Rotations:\nThe block has four rotations:\n- **0°\/180°**: 2 rows high, 3 columns wide, shape `**0` (top row) and `0**` (bottom row).\n- **90°\/270°**: 3 rows high, 2 columns wide, shape `0*` (top row), `**` (middle row), `*0` (bottom row).\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The rightmost columns (7-10) are empty, providing space to place the block without collision.\n- The 90° rotation (3 rows high, 2 columns wide) fits well in the empty right columns (7-8) and can land stably at the bottom.\n\n### Placement Simulation (90° Rotation, x=7):\n- **Columns Covered**: x=7 (leftmost column) covers columns 7 and 8 (width 2).\n- **Landing Position**: The block falls until it hits the bottom or existing blocks. Since columns 7-8 are empty (HFR=10 for these columns), the block lands at row 7 (y=7).\n- **Cells Occupied**: (8,7), (7,8), (8,8), (7,9) (all within empty rows\/columns).\n\nThis placement is valid, avoids collisions, and builds up the right side of the board.\n\nAnswer: 7 90","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's possible rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands without overlapping existing blocks and contributes to building towards line clears in future moves.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 columns (1-based) and 10 rows (top to bottom). Key observations:\n- Rows 0 and 1 are completely empty.\n- Rows 2–9 have partial fills, with no complete lines (score remains 0).\n- Columns 0–7 have scattered fills, while columns 8 and 9 are mostly empty (only column 7 has fills in rows 7–9).\n\n### Block Analysis:\nThe current block is a line piece with two distinct rotations:\n- **0°\/180°**: Horizontal (4 cells in a row, width 4, height 1).\n- **90°\/270°**: Vertical (4 cells in a column, width 1, height 4).\n\n### Horizontal Rotations (0°\/180°):\nA horizontal block (width 4) requires 4 consecutive empty columns in a row. However, existing fills in columns 0–7 (e.g., row 2 has columns 2–5 filled) make horizontal placement challenging without overlapping. For example, placing a horizontal block in columns 2–5 (x=3) would overlap with row 2’s existing fills. Thus, horizontal rotations are not ideal.\n\n### Vertical Rotations (90°\/270°):\nA vertical block (height 4, width 1) requires a single column with 4 consecutive empty rows. Columns 8 and 9 are mostly empty, making them viable:\n- **Column 9 (1-based x=10)**: All rows in column 9 are empty. A vertical block here will fall to the bottom, occupying rows 6–9 (since the block’s height is 4). This placement avoids overlapping and balances the board by filling the rightmost column.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the vertical block (90° rotation) in column 10 (1-based) is optimal, as it safely lands without overlapping and contributes to building a balanced board.\n\nAnswer: 10 90","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current Tetris board, block rotations, and potential landing positions. The goal is to place the block as low as possible while avoiding holes and setting up for future line clears.\n\n### Board Analysis\nThe board has 10 rows (0–9) and 10 columns (0–9, 1-based 1–10). Key observations:\n- Rows 0–1 are empty.\n- Rows 2–9 have partial fills, with row 8 having 8 filled cells (columns 0–1, 4–7, 9) and row 9 having 6 filled cells (columns 0–1, 3, 5, 7, 9).\n- No complete rows exist (score remains 0).\n\n### Block Rotations\nThe current block has four rotations:\n- **0°**: 3 columns wide (shape: `0*0` over `***`), covering columns \\( x-1, x, x+1 \\) (1-based \\( x \\)).\n- **90°**: 2 columns wide (shape: `*0` over `**` over `*0`), covering columns \\( x-1, x \\).\n- **180°**: 3 columns wide (shape: `***` over `0*0`), covering columns \\( x-1, x, x+1 \\).\n- **270°**: 2 columns wide (shape: `0*` over `**` over `0*`), covering columns \\( x-1, x \\).\n\n### Key Considerations\n- **Line Clears**: Row 8 needs 2 more filled cells (columns 2–3) to clear, but no rotation can fill these without collision.\n- **Low Placement**: The block should land as low as possible to avoid stacking. 0° rotation (3 columns wide) is prioritized for stability.\n\n### Optimal Move\nFor **0° rotation** (3 columns wide), placing the leftmost column at \\( x = 3 \\) (1-based) covers columns 2–4 (0-based). The block’s shape (`0*0` over `***`) fits into the middle of the board, avoiding immediate collisions and minimizing holes. This placement lands the block in the lowest possible row (row 1) without overlapping existing fills, setting up for future line clears.\n\nAnswer: 3 0","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's possible rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands without exceeding the top boundary and maximizes line clears (though no lines can be cleared here). \n\n### Current Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 columns (0-9) and 10 rows (0-9, top to bottom). The falling block has two unique rotations:  \n- **0°\/180°**: 2 rows high, 3 columns wide, with occupied cells at (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1) (relative to the block's top-left corner).  \n- **90°\/270°**: 3 rows high, 2 columns wide, with occupied cells at (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1) (relative to the block's top-left corner).  \n\n### Key Observations:\n- No rows are close to being fully filled (maximum 7 filled cells in any row), so no line clears are possible.  \n- The block must be placed such that it lands without overlapping existing blocks or exceeding the top boundary.  \n\n### Evaluation of 90° Rotation (3 rows high, 2 columns wide):\nFor 90° rotation, the block spans 2 columns (leftmost column \\( x-1 \\) and \\( x \\), where \\( x \\) is the drop coordinate). We need to find a valid \\( x \\) and landing row \\( r \\) where all block cells fit into empty board cells.  \n\n#### Candidate: \\( x = 6 \\) (columns 5 and 6):\n- **Block cells**: ( \\( r \\), 5), ( \\( r+1 \\), 5), ( \\( r+1 \\), 6), ( \\( r+2 \\), 6).  \n- **Board check**: Columns 5 and 6 have empty cells in rows 5-7. Placing the block at \\( r = 5 \\) ensures all cells fit:  \n  - Row 5, column 5: empty.  \n  - Row 6, column 5: empty.  \n  - Row 6, column 6: empty.  \n  - Row 7, column 6: empty.  \n- **Landing**: The block cannot fall further because row 8, column 6 is filled, so it lands at \\( r = 5 \\).  \n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the 90°-rotated block at drop coordinate 6 is valid and avoids game over.  \n\nAnswer: 6 90","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block. The block is an I-tetromino with horizontal (0°\/180°) and vertical (90°\/270°) rotations. The goal is to place the block to minimize future stacking and avoid topping out.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 columns. Key observations:\n- Column 3 (index 2) is completely empty (no filled cells in any row).\n- Other columns have varying heights, with Column 4 (index 3) being the tallest (9 filled cells).\n\n### Block Options:\n- **Horizontal rotation (0°\/180°)**: Covers 4 columns. Placing it over Columns 3-6 (leftmost 3) would require landing on the tallest column (Column 4, height 9), resulting in minimal row filling and no cleared rows.\n- **Vertical rotation (90°\/270°)**: Covers 1 column. Column 3 is empty, allowing the vertical block to fall to the bottom (rows 7-10 in Column 3) without overlapping existing blocks. This fills a critical empty column, promoting a flatter stack and reducing future topping risk.\n\n### Optimal Action:\nPlacing the vertical block (90° rotation) in Column 3 (leftmost coordinate 3) fills the empty column, supporting a more stable stack.\n\nAnswer: 3 90"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The leftmost column of the block’s occupied squares is column 0 (of the block), so the drop coordinate `x` ranges from 1 to 8 (to fit within the 10-column board).  \n\n- **90° Rotation**: The block shape is:  \n  `*0` (top row, left column occupied)  \n  `**` (middle row, both columns occupied)  \n  `*0` (bottom row, left column occupied).  \n  This is a vertical shape spanning 2 columns (width 2) and 3 rows (height 3).

For the 0° rotation (3 columns wide), centering the block around column 5 (the board’s midpoint) requires the leftmost column `x = 4` (covering columns 4–6). This positions the T-shape’s base (*** in row 10) and center (* in row 9) symmetrically, leaving balanced space on both sides.  \n\n### Action:\nPlace the 0°-rotated block at drop coordinate 4, centering it on the board.  \n\nAnswer: 4 0","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations.

The existing blocks are concentrated in lower rows (rows 4–9), with gaps in higher rows (rows 0–3). The current score is 0, meaning no rows have been cleared yet.\n\n### Block Rotations:\n- **0° and 180°**: The block shape is:  \n  `**0`  \n  `0**`  \n  This occupies 3 columns (width) and 2 rows (height), with cells at (row 0, col 0), (row 0, col 1), (row 1, col 1), (row 1, col 2) in local coordinates.  \n- **90° and 270°**: The block shape is:  \n  `0*`  \n  `**`  \n  `*0`  \n  This occupies 2 columns (width) and 3 rows (height), with cells at (row 0, col 1), (row 1, col 0), (row 1, col 1), (row 2, col 0) in local coordinates.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The highest existing blocks are in rows 4–9, with gaps in columns 5–7 of the lower rows (rows 8–9). Placing the block in these gaps will help minimize stack height.  \n- For the 0° rotation (3 columns wide), the leftmost coordinate (x) can range from 1 to 8. Columns 5–7 are mostly empty in lower rows, making x=5 a viable position.  \n\n### Placement Validation for 0° Rotation at x=5:\n- **Columns Covered**: Columns 5, 6, 7 (leftmost at x=5).  \n- **Landing Row**: The block falls until it hits the bottom or existing blocks. Since columns 5–7 are mostly empty in rows 8–9, the block lands at row 8 (top row of the block) and row 9 (bottom row of the block).  \n- **Validation**: Cells (8,5), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7) are empty in the current board, confirming valid placement.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the 0°-rotated block at leftmost coordinate 5 ensures it lands low, fills gaps, and avoids stacking height. \n\nAnswer: 5 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block as low as possible to avoid unnecessary height buildup, given no immediate line clears are possible.\n\n### Board Analysis\nThe board has 10 rows (0-9) and 10 columns (1-10). Key observations about occupied columns per row:\n- Rows 0-3: All empty.\n- Row 4: Columns 4-6 occupied.\n- Row 5: Columns 3-7 occupied.\n- Row 6: Column 3 occupied.\n- Row 7: Columns 2-4 occupied.\n- Row 8: Columns 1-2 and 4-5 occupied.\n- Row 9: Columns 1, 4-6 occupied.\n\n### Block Rotations\nThe block has two unique rotations (0°\/180° and 90°\/270°). We focus on 90° rotation, which has a vertical shape (3 rows high, 2 columns wide), as it can fit into gaps more effectively.\n\n### 90° Rotation Details\nThe 90° block occupies cells:  \n- (r, x+1), (r+1, x), (r+1, x+1), (r+2, x) (board coordinates, where \\( r \\) is the top row of the block, and \\( x \\) is the leftmost column).\n\n### Optimal Placement\nWe seek the lowest possible \\( r \\) where the block fits without overlapping existing blocks. For \\( x=2 \\) (leftmost column 2, covering columns 2 and 3):\n- Cells to check: (r, 3), (r+1, 2), (r+1, 3), (r+2, 2).\n- Checking from the bottom up, the highest \\( r \\) where these cells are empty is \\( r=3 \\):\n  - (3, 3): Empty (row 3).\n  - (4, 2): Empty (row 4, column 2).\n  - (4, 3): Empty (row 4, column 3).\n  - (5, 2): Empty (row 5, column 2).\n\nPlacing the block here lands it in rows 3-5, the lowest possible position without overlapping existing blocks.\n\nAnswer: 2 90","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block. The board has 10 rows (top to bottom: rows 1-10) and 10 columns (left to right: columns 1-10). The current block is a straight line, which can be horizontal (0°\/180°: ****) or vertical (90°\/270°: four stacked *). \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Board State**: Rows 1-3 are entirely empty. Rows 4-10 have scattered filled cells, with columns 1-7 containing most of the filled blocks. Columns 8-10 are almost entirely empty (only row 6, column 7 has a filled cell, but columns 8-10 are empty in all rows).\n2. **Block Options**:\n   - **Horizontal (0°\/180°)**: Occupies 4 columns in 1 row. Placing it in columns 7-10 (leftmost column 7) would land in row 10 (bottom row) since columns 7-10 in row 10 are empty. However, this does not clear any rows.\n   - **Vertical (90°\/270°)**: Occupies 4 rows in 1 column. Columns 8-10 are empty, so placing the vertical block in these columns allows it to fall to the bottom without overlapping existing blocks. For example, placing it in column 8 (leftmost column 8) with rotation 90° will occupy rows 7-10 (top to bottom) in column 8, as these rows are empty in column 8.\n\n### Optimal Action:\nPlacing the vertical block in column 8 (leftmost column 8) with rotation 90° is ideal. This uses an empty column, avoids stacking in already populated columns, and keeps the board balanced.\n\nAnswer: 8 90","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current Tetris board and the falling block (an I-block with horizontal and vertical rotations). The goal is to place the block such that it lands without exceeding the top boundary and ideally sets up for future line clears.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 rows (0 to 9, top to bottom) and 10 columns (1 to 10). Key observations about existing blocks:\n- Rows 0-2 are empty.\n- Row 3 has a block in column 3.\n- Rows 4-5 have dense blocks in columns 2-7.\n- Rows 6-9 have scattered blocks, with column 8 having blocks in rows 6-9.\n\n### Block Options:\nThe I-block can be horizontal (0° or 180°, covering 4 columns in a row) or vertical (90° or 270°, covering 4 rows in a column). We focus on horizontal placement as it is more likely to fill rows and set up for line clears.\n\n### Horizontal Placement (0° or 180°):\nA horizontal I-block (****) spans 4 columns. We need to find a column range where the block can fall to a row without overlapping existing blocks. \n\n#### Columns 4-7 (leftmost coordinate 4):\n- Columns 4-7 in rows 0-5 have existing blocks in rows 4-5 (columns 4-6) and row 5 (column 7).\n- The highest existing block in columns 4-7 is in row 5 (column 7). The block will fall until it lands on row 6 (the first row below row 5 where columns 4-7 are empty).\n- Placing the block here (leftmost coordinate 4, rotation 0°) covers columns 4-7 in row 6, which is empty and does not overlap existing blocks. This keeps the stack low and avoids raising the highest block level excessively.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the horizontal I-block at leftmost coordinate 4 with 0° rotation is optimal, as it lands safely in row 6 without overlapping existing blocks and maintains a low stack height.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","\nTo determine the optimal action for placing the current 2x2 block, we analyze the game board and possible positions. The block is a square (2x2) in all rotations, so rotation angle does not affect its shape. The goal is to place the block as low as possible to avoid stacking height and maximize survival.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Board Analysis**: The board has empty columns 8 and 9 (0-based), meaning the rightmost columns (1-based 9 and 10) are mostly empty. Columns 8 and 9 (0-based) have no filled cells in any row, allowing the block to fall to the bottom.\n2. **Landing Position**: For the rightmost valid column (1-based 9, 0-based 8), the block can fall to the bottom of the board (rows 8 and 9, 0-based) without overlapping existing blocks. This is the lowest possible position.\n\n### Action Selection:\n- **Drop Coordinate**: The leftmost column of the block is 9 (1-based), corresponding to 0-based column 8.\n- **Rotation Angle**: All rotations are identical, so any rotation (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) is valid. We choose 0° for simplicity.\n\nAnswer: 9 0","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current Tetris board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands without exceeding the top boundary and maximizes future line-clearing potential.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 rows (top row 0 to bottom row 9). Rows 3-5 are partially filled, with row 5 (`.******...`) having columns 1-6 filled. Rows 6-9 have scattered filled cells but no complete lines. The current score is 0, so no lines have been cleared yet.\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe block has two distinct rotations:\n- **0°\/180°**: 3 columns wide, 2 rows tall. Shape:  \n  `0**`  \n  `**0`  \n- **90°\/270°**: 2 columns wide, 3 rows tall. Shape:  \n  `*0`  \n  `**`  \n  `0*`  \n\n### Strategy:\nWe prioritize placing the block in a position that fills gaps in the lower rows (to set up future line clears) and avoids creating holes. The 90° rotation (2 columns wide) is chosen for its vertical orientation, which can fit into narrower gaps.\n\n### Placement Check for 90° Rotation at x=5:\n- **Drop coordinate (x=5)**: Leftmost column is 5 (1-based), corresponding to column 4 (0-based).  \n- **Block cells**: (y, 4), (y+1, 4), (y+1, 5), (y+2, 5) (0-based board coordinates).  \n\nThe block falls until it hits existing blocks or the bottom. Simulating descent:\n- At y=0: Cells (0,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) are all empty (`.`) in rows 0-2.  \n- Moving down to y=1 would place cells (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5). Row 3, column 5 is filled (`*`), causing a collision.  \n\nThus, the block lands at y=0, with no overlap and no top boundary violation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the 90°-rotated block at drop coordinate 5 is valid and positions the block to fill gaps in the upper rows, supporting future line-clearing opportunities.\n\nAnswer: 5 90","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current Tetris board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands as low as possible without overlapping existing blocks, ideally setting up for future line clears.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 columns (1-based, 0-9 in 0-based) and 10 rows (top to bottom, 0-9). The current block has two unique rotations:\n- **0°\/180°**: 3 columns wide (shape: `**0` over `0**`).\n- **90°\/270°**: 2 columns wide (shape: `0*` over `**` over `*0`).\n\n### Key Observations:\n- No rows are fully filled (score = 0), so the priority is to place the block low to avoid stacking high.\n- The 90° rotation (2 columns wide) offers more flexibility in tight spaces compared to the 0° rotation (3 columns wide).\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nWe evaluate the 90° rotation (2 columns wide) for placement in columns where it can land low. The 90° block’s cells are:\n- Row 0: column `x+1` (1-based)\n- Row 1: columns `x` and `x+1` (1-based)\n- Row 2: column `x` (1-based)\n\n### Optimal Placement:\nTesting `x=5` (1-based, 0-based column 4) with 90° rotation:\n- Columns covered: 4 and 5 (0-based).\n- The block’s cells are `(r,5)`, `(r+1,4)`, `(r+1,5)`, `(r+2,4)` (0-based).\n- Checking from the bottom up, the highest obstacle in columns 4 and 5 is row 5 (0-based). Thus, the block lands at `r=2` (0-based row 2), avoiding overlaps.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the block at `x=5` (1-based) with 90° rotation allows it to land low, minimizing stack height and setting up for future line clears.\n\nAnswer: 5 90"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Placing it horizontally in the bottom row (row 10) maximizes coverage in a single row, which can help set up future line clears. \n- **Vertical Rotations (90°\/270°)**: The block spans 4 rows, occupying a single column. This leaves more vertical space but is less effective for immediate line clearing potential.\n\n### Strategy:\nSince the board is empty, placing the block horizontally in the middle of the bottom row (row 10) balances coverage and future flexibility. A horizontal block (0° rotation) placed at drop coordinate 4 will occupy columns 4-7 in row 10, centralizing the block and leaving space on both sides for subsequent blocks.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block. The board has 10 rows, with the bottom row (row 10) containing `...****...` (columns 4-7 filled) and all other rows empty. The falling block is a 2x2 square (all rotations are identical: `**` on both rows). \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Block Behavior**: The 2x2 block occupies 2 columns (leftmost column `x` to `x+1`) and 2 rows (top row `y` to `y+1`). It falls until obstructed by existing blocks or the bottom of the board.\n2. **Landing Position**: Since rows 1-9 are empty, the block will fall to the lowest possible position, with its bottom row at row 10. The block will land in rows 9 and 10, columns `x` and `x+1`.\n3. **Valid Columns**: The bottom row (row 10) has empty columns 1-3 and 8-10 (columns 4-7 are filled). Thus, the leftmost column `x` must be such that `x` and `x+1` are in these empty regions. Valid `x` values are 1, 2, 8, or 9.\n4. **Rotation**: All rotations of the block are identical (2x2 square), so any rotation angle (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) is acceptable.\n\n### Action Selection:\nChoosing `x=1` (leftmost valid column) and `0°` rotation (arbitrary, as all rotations are identical) is a valid solution.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands as low as possible, ideally contributing to clearing rows (though no rows are clearable immediately). \n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 columns. The bottom two rows (rows 9 and 10) have existing blocks:\n- Row 9: `**........` (columns 1-2 filled).\n- Row 10: `**.* ****...` (columns 1-2 and 4-7 filled).\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe current block has four rotations. We focus on the 0° rotation, which has a 2-row, 3-column shape:\n```\n*00\n***\n```\nThis shape has a top row with a single block in column 1 (relative to the block) and a bottom row with three consecutive blocks in columns 1-3 (relative to the block).\n\n### Placement Strategy:\nThe 0° rotation is 3 columns wide, so the leftmost drop coordinate (x) ranges from 1 to 8. We aim to place the block in a position that fills empty columns in the bottom rows (row 10) to set up for future row clears. \n\n### Optimal Placement:\nPlacing the 0° rotation at **x=8** (leftmost column 8) covers columns 8-10. The block falls to the bottom (row 10) because columns 8-10 are empty in rows 1-10. The block’s top row lands in row 9 (column 8), and the bottom row lands in row 10 (columns 8-10). This placement fills three empty columns (8-10) in row 10, bringing row 10 to 9 filled cells (columns 1-2, 4-10), leaving only column 3 empty.

The goal is to place the block such that it lands without exceeding the top boundary and, if possible, clears a row to increase the score.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 columns and 10 rows (top row 1 to bottom row 10). The bottom two rows (rows 9 and 10) have existing blocks:\n- Row 10 (bottom row): `**.*******` (columns 1-2 and 4-10 filled; column 3 empty).\n- Row 9: `**.....*..` (columns 1-2 and 7 filled; columns 3-6 and 8-10 empty).\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe current block has four rotations. We focus on the 90° rotation, which has a 2-column width (columns x and x+1) and 3-row height. Its shape is:\n```\n*0\n**\n*0\n```\nThis rotation’s cells occupy:\n- Row 1 (top of the block): column x.\n- Row 2 (middle of the block): columns x and x+1.\n- Row 3 (bottom of the block): column x.\n\n### Key Insight:\nRow 10 (bottom row) has only column 3 empty. If we can fill column 3 in row 10, the entire row will be cleared, increasing the score. \n\n### Placement for 90° Rotation:\n- **Drop coordinate (x) = 3**: The block’s leftmost column is 3, so it spans columns 3 and 4.\n- **Landing Position**: The block falls until it hits existing blocks or the bottom. For column 3 (empty in all rows) and column 4 (filled in row 10), the block lands such that:\n  - Top row (row 8, column 3).\n  - Middle row (row 9, columns 3 and 4).\n  - Bottom row (row 10, column 3).\n\n### Outcome:\nPlacing the 90° rotation at x=3 fills column 3 in row 10, completing the row. This clears row 10, increasing the score by 1.\n\nAnswer: 3 90","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block. The block is a 2x2 square (O-tetromino), which has identical shapes across all rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°). Thus, rotation does not affect its placement. The goal is to place the block such that it lands stably and avoids creating gaps.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 rows (0: top, 9: bottom). Key occupied positions:\n- Row 9 (bottom row): Columns 1-4 and 7 are occupied (`****...*..`).\n- Row 8: Column 3 is occupied (`..*.......`).\n- All other rows (0-7) are empty.\n\n### Block Placement:\nThe block is 2 columns wide and 2 rows tall. We need to find the leftmost column (1-9) where the block can land without overlapping existing blocks. \n\n#### Key Observations:\n- Columns 1-4 and 7 in row 9 are occupied, so placing the block here would collide with existing blocks.\n- Columns 5-6 and 8-10 in row 9 are empty. Placing the block in these columns allows it to fall to the bottom.\n\n#### Optimal Position:\nPlacing the block in column 5 (leftmost) covers columns 5-6. Since these columns are empty in rows 0-9, the block will fall to the bottom, occupying rows 8 and 9 (columns 5-6). This placement avoids gaps and helps build a flat stack, which is ideal for future moves.\n\n### Rotation:\nSince all rotations of the block are identical, any rotation angle (e.g., 0°) is valid.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","\nTo solve this Tetris problem, we need to determine the optimal placement (drop coordinate and rotation) for the current falling block such that it lands without overlapping existing blocks and maximizes the potential for line clears. \n\n### Analysis of the Game Board and Block\n- **Board State**: The board has 10 columns (1-based) and 10 rows (0-based, with row 9 being the bottom). The bottom two rows (rows 8 and 9) have partial fills:\n  - Row 8: `..*.**....` (columns 2, 4, 5 filled).\n  - Row 9: `******.*..` (columns 0-5, 7 filled).\n- **Current Block**: The block has two unique rotations (0°\/180° and 90°\/270°). \n  - **0°\/180°**: A 3-column wide, 2-row tall block with cells at (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2) (block coordinates).\n  - **90°\/270°**: A 2-column wide, 3-row tall block with cells at (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0) (block coordinates).\n\n### Key Observations\n- **0°\/180° Rotation**: Width 3, so drop coordinates (1-based) range from 1 to 8. This rotation is less likely to fill gaps in the bottom rows due to its width.\n- **90°\/270° Rotation**: Width 2, so drop coordinates (1-based) range from 1 to 9. This rotation is more flexible for filling gaps in the bottom rows.\n\n### Simulation of 90° Rotation at Drop Coordinate 4\nFor the 90° rotation (2 columns wide), consider drop coordinate 4 (1-based, 0-based column 3). The block covers columns 3 and 4 (0-based). The block’s cells in board coordinates are:\n- (4, y) (column 4, row y)\n- (3, y+1) (column 3, row y+1)\n- (4, y+1) (column 4, row y+1)\n- (3, y+2) (column 3, row y+2)\n\n### Landing Position\nThe block falls until it hits existing blocks or the bottom. For drop coordinate 4 (0-based column 3) and 90° rotation:\n- **y=7** (top row 7, bottom row 9): Collision at (4,8) (row 8, column 4 is filled).\n- **y=6** (top row 6, bottom row 8): All cells (4,6), (3,7), (4,7), (3,8) are empty. The block lands here.\n\n### Outcome\nPlacing the block at drop coordinate 4 (1-based) with 90° rotation fills cells (4,6), (3,7), (4,7), (3,8). This does not clear any lines but is a valid placement.\n\nAnswer: 4 90","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's possible rotations and positions. The goal is to place the block as low as possible to avoid stacking too high and to work towards clearing lines.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has existing blocks in rows 6-9. Key filled positions include:\n- Row 9: Columns 1-6, 8 (7 filled, 3 empty).\n- Row 8: Columns 3-6 (4 filled, 6 empty).\n- Row 7: Columns 4-5 (2 filled, 8 empty).\n- Row 6: Column 5 (1 filled, 9 empty).\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe block has two unique rotations:\n1. **0°\/180°**: 2 rows high, 3 columns wide.

This positions the block to fill gaps in row 8, moving it closer to being fully filled. \n\n- **x=1 (leftmost column 1)**: The block covers columns 1-3. The highest valid y (lowest row) is 7, where the block lands without overlapping existing blocks. After placement:\n  - Row 7 gains cells (2,7), (3,7).\n  - Row 8 gains cells (1,8), (2,8), filling columns 1-2 (complementing existing columns 3-6 in row 8).\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the block with 0° rotation at column 1 maximizes the block's height (lowest landing position) and helps build toward clearing lines in future moves.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands as low as possible, avoiding holes and potentially setting up for future line clears.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has existing blocks in rows 6-9 (0-based). Key columns with blocks:\n- Columns 1-6 (1-based) have blocks in rows 7-9.\n- Column 5 (1-based) has a block in row 6.\n- Columns 7-10 (1-based) are mostly empty.\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe current block has two unique rotations:\n- **0°\/180°**: Shape is `**0` over `0**` (3 columns wide, 2 rows tall).\n- **90°\/270°**: Shape is `0*` over `**` over `*0` (2 columns wide, 3 rows tall).\n\n### Strategy:\nThe 0° rotation (3 columns wide) is prioritized due to its wider coverage, which can fill gaps more effectively. We evaluate placing it in columns where it can land lowest without overlapping existing blocks.\n\n### Placement Evaluation for 0° Rotation:\n- **Leftmost coordinate (c=5, 1-based)**: Covers columns 5-7 (1-based, 0-based 4-6). \n  - Column 5 (1-based) has a block in row 6 (0-based).\n  - Columns 6-7 (1-based) are mostly empty (blocks in row 8-9).\n  - The block lands at rows 5-6 (0-based), filling gaps above the existing block in column 5.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the 0° block at c=5 (1-based) allows it to land low, filling empty space without creating holes.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","\nTo solve this Tetris problem, we analyze the current game board and the falling block to determine the optimal placement. The goal is to place the block as low as possible to avoid stacking height and potentially clear lines (though no lines can be cleared in this scenario).\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 columns and 10 rows (0-9, top to bottom). Rows 0-4 are empty. Rows 5-9 have partial fills:\n- Row 5: `....**....` (columns 5-6 filled)\n- Row 6: `....***...` (columns 5-7 filled)\n- Row 7: `.****.....` (columns 2-5 filled)\n- Row 8: `******....` (columns 1-6 filled)\n- Row 9: `******.*..` (columns 1-6 and 8 filled)\n\n### Current Block:\nThe block is a straight line with two distinct rotations:\n- **0°\/180° (horizontal):** 4 cells in a row (`****`).\n- **90°\/270° (vertical):** 4 cells in a column (`*` stacked 4 times).\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Horizontal Block (0°\/180°):** Occupies 4 columns. To land, it must clear all columns it covers until obstructed by existing blocks or the bottom.\n2. **Vertical Block (90°\/270°):** Occupies 1 column. To land, it must clear 4 rows in a single column until obstructed.\n\n### Optimal Placement for Horizontal Block:\nFor the horizontal block, we evaluate possible leftmost columns (1-7) and determine the lowest row it can land. The critical factor is the highest filled row in the columns covered by the block. The block lands at the minimum row where all covered columns are clear.\n\n- **Leftmost Column 1 (x=1):** Covers columns 1-4. The highest filled rows in these columns are row 8 (column 1), row 7 (columns 2-4). The minimum row to land is row 6 (since row 7 is the highest obstruction in columns 2-4). Placing the block here fills row 6, columns 1-4, which are empty, and does not overlap with existing fills.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the horizontal block (0° rotation) at leftmost column 1 lands it at row 6, the lowest possible position without overlapping existing blocks. This avoids unnecessary stacking and is the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board, stack heights, and possible rotations of the falling block. The goal is to place the block such that it lands without exceeding the top boundary and maximizes potential line clears.\n\n### Board Analysis\nThe board has 10 rows (0-top to 9-bottom). Key rows with filled cells:\n- Row 5: `....**....` (columns 4-5 filled)\n- Row 6: `*******...` (columns 0-6 filled)\n- Row 7: `.****.....` (columns 1-4 filled)\n- Row 8: `******....` (columns 0-5 filled)\n- Row 9: `******.*..` (columns 0-5, 7 filled)\n\n### Stack Heights (0-based columns 0-9)\n- Columns 0-3: Stack height 6 (first filled cell in row 6)\n- Columns 4-5: Stack height 5 (first filled cell in row 5)\n- Column 6: Stack height 6 (first filled cell in row 6)\n- Column 7: Stack height 9 (first filled cell in row 9)\n- Columns 8-9: Stack height 10 (no filled cells)\n\n### Block Rotations\nThe block has four rotations. We focus on the 0° rotation, which is 3 columns wide and 2 rows tall:\n- 0° shape:  \n  `00*` (top row: column 2 filled)  \n  `***` (bottom row: columns 0-2 filled)  \n\n### Optimal Placement\nFor 0° rotation, the block covers 3 columns (leftmost x, 1-based). We need to place it where it lands safely and fills gaps. \n\n#### Key Position: x=5 (1-based)\n- **Columns covered (0-based): 4, 5, 6**  \n  - Top row of the block (row `y`) covers column 6 (0-based).  \n  - Bottom row of the block (row `y+1`) covers columns 4, 5, 6 (0-based).  \n\n#### Stack Height Constraints:\n- Column 6 (top row): Stack height 6 → `y < 6`.  \n- Columns 4-5 (bottom row): Stack height 5 → `y+1 < 5` → `y < 4`.  \n\nThus, the maximum `y` is 3 (top row at row 3, bottom row at row 4).  \n\n### Outcome\nPlacing the block at x=5 (1-based) with 0° rotation fills:\n- Row 3, column 6 (top row of the block).  \n- Row 4, columns 4-6 (bottom row of the block).  \n\nThis placement is safe (no overflow) and builds toward future line clears.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands stably, minimizes holes, and sets up for potential line clears.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 rows (0 to 9, top to bottom). Key observations:\n- Rows 0-2 are empty.\n- Row 3 has a single * in column 7.\n- Row 4 has *** in columns 5-7.\n- Row 5 has ** in columns 5-6.\n- Row 6 has ******* in columns 1-7.\n- Rows 7-9 have partial fills.\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe block has four rotations:\n- **0°**: 3 columns wide, 2 rows tall. Shape:  \n  `0*0`  \n  `***`  \n- **90°**: 2 columns wide, 3 rows tall. Shape:  \n  `*0`  \n  `**`  \n  `*0`  \n- **180°**: 3 columns wide, 2 rows tall (mirror of 0°).  \n- **270°**: 2 columns wide, 3 rows tall (mirror of 90°).  \n\n### Strategy:\nThe 0° rotation (3 columns wide) is chosen to fill gaps in row 3 (columns 5-7), which are mostly empty except for column 7. Placing the block at leftmost column 5 (covering columns 5-7) ensures it lands on the highest existing blocks in these columns, filling the row and minimizing holes.\n\n### Placement Validation:\n- **0° rotation at x=5** (leftmost column 5):\n  - Covers columns 5, 6, 7.\n  - The block’s cells are: (row r, column 6) [top row], and (row r+1, columns 5, 6, 7) [bottom row].\n  - The highest filled rows in columns 5, 6, 7 are 4, 4, and 3 (respectively). The block lands at r=2 (top row) and r+1=3 (bottom row), as this is the lowest position where no collisions occur.\n  - After placement, row 3 (columns 5-7) is filled, and row 2 (column 6) gains a *.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board, the falling block's rotations, and potential landing positions. The goal is to place the block such that it lands stably, avoids exceeding the top boundary, and ideally clears rows to increase the score.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 columns (0-9) and 10 rows (0-9, top to bottom). Key observations about occupied rows:\n- Rows 6-9 have significant existing blocks, with Row 6 being nearly full (columns 0-6 occupied).\n- Upper rows (0-5) have scattered blocks, leaving gaps in columns 0-3 and 7-9.\n\n### Current Block Rotations:\nThe block has four rotations:\n- **0°**: Shape is 2 rows high, 3 columns wide: `*00` (top row) and `***` (bottom row).\n- **90°**: Shape is 3 rows high, 2 columns wide: `**`, `*0`, `*0`.\n- **180°**: Shape is 2 rows high, 3 columns wide: `***` (top row) and `00*` (bottom row).\n- **270°**: Shape is 3 rows high, 2 columns wide: `0*`, `0*`, `**`.\n\n### Strategy:\nPrioritize rotations with smaller height (0° or 180°) to avoid stacking too high. Focus on placing the block in gaps in the upper rows (0-5) where it can land stably without overlapping existing blocks.\n\n### 0° Rotation (2 rows high, 3 columns wide):\nThe 0° rotation’s shape (`*00` top, `***` bottom) fits well in gaps. We evaluate potential drop coordinates (x) where the block can land:\n- **x=5 (columns 4-6)**: The block’s bottom row (`***`) targets columns 4-6, which have gaps in rows 0-5. The top row (`*00`) targets column 4. \n- **Landing Check**: The block falls until it hits existing blocks or the bottom. For x=5, the block lands in row 3 (top row at row 3, bottom row at row 4), as lower rows (4-5) in columns 4-6 are partially occupied but allow stable placement.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the 0° rotation at x=5 ensures the block lands stably in the upper rows, avoiding immediate game over and setting up for future row clears.\n\nAnswer: 5 0"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The leftmost column (drop coordinate) can range from 1 to 8 (since 3 columns wide). Placing it in the middle (column 4) centers the block, which is a common strategy for initial placements.  \n\n- **90° Rotation**: The block shape is:  \n  `**`  \n  `*0`  \n  `*0`  \n  This is a 3-row, 2-column block. The leftmost column can range from 1 to 9, but centering it (column 5) is an option.  \n\n- **180° Rotation**: The block shape is:  \n  `***`  \n  `00*`  \n  This is a 2-row, 3-column block, similar to 0° but flipped.

The leftmost column ranges from 1 to 9, with column 5 being a central choice.  \n\n### Optimal Choice:\nSince the board is empty, any valid placement is acceptable. Placing the 0° rotation in the middle (column 4) is a reasonable choice to balance coverage and future flexibility.  \n\nAnswer: 4 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The board has existing blocks in row 9 (column 4) and row 10 (columns 4–6). The goal is to place the block such that it lands without overlapping existing blocks and fits within the board boundaries.\n\n### Current Block Rotations:\n- **0°\/180°**: 3 columns wide (columns 1–3 of the block's grid) and 2 rows tall. Occupied cells: (row 1, column 2), (row 1, column 3), (row 2, column 1), (row 2, column 2).\n- **90°\/270°**: 2 columns wide (columns 1–2 of the block's grid) and 3 rows tall. Occupied cells: (row 1, column 1), (row 2, column 1), (row 2, column 2), (row 3, column 2).\n\n### Analysis of 0° Rotation (3 columns wide):\nFor the 0° rotation, the block spans 3 columns. We need to find a drop coordinate (leftmost column) where the block can fall to the lowest possible row without overlapping existing blocks. \n\n#### Drop Coordinate 4:\n- The block spans columns 4–6 (leftmost column 4). The occupied cells relative to the block's top-left corner (row \\( y \\), column 4) are: ( \\( y \\), 5), ( \\( y \\), 6), ( \\( y+1 \\), 4), ( \\( y+1 \\), 5).\n- Existing blocks in column 4 (row 9 and 10) and column 5 (row 10) limit how far the block can fall. The block will land when its bottom row ( \\( y+1 \\)) is just above the existing blocks. \n\n### Landing Position for 0° Rotation at Drop Coordinate 4:\n- The block falls until \\( y+1 = 8 \\) (row 8), with \\( y = 7 \\) (row 7). This places the block's cells at:\n  - Row 7, columns 5–6 (top row of the block).\n  - Row 8, columns 4–5 (bottom row of the block).\n- This position avoids overlapping existing blocks and fits within the board.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the 0°-rotated block at drop coordinate 4 is optimal, as it lands securely without overlapping existing blocks and does not exceed the board boundaries.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block. The board has existing blocks in rows 6-9, with no complete rows (required for scoring). The current block is a 2x2 square (O tetromino), which is rotationally symmetric (all rotations are identical). Thus, the rotation angle does not affect the block's shape.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Block Shape**: The block is 2x2, so it occupies 2 columns (leftmost coordinate \\( x \\) and \\( x+1 \\)) and 2 rows when placed.\n2. **Landing Position**: The block falls until it hits existing blocks or the bottom. We need to choose a leftmost coordinate \\( x \\) (1-10) such that the block lands without exceeding the top boundary (row 0).\n3. **Row Clearing**: No existing row has 10 filled squares, so placing the block will not clear any rows regardless of position.\n\n### Valid Positions:\nThe block can be placed in any column from 1 to 9 (since it spans 2 columns). For simplicity, we choose a central position (column 4) to avoid edge alignment issues. The rotation angle is irrelevant, so we select 0° (default).\n\nAnswer: 4 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board, existing block positions, and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands without exceeding the top boundary and avoids creating unnecessary holes.\n\n### Board Analysis\nThe board has 10 columns (0-9) and 10 rows (0-9, top to bottom). Existing blocks are concentrated in columns 3-5, with the highest occupied rows at:\n- Columns 3-4: Row 4 (topmost occupied row)\n- Column 5: Row 6 (topmost occupied row)\n- Other columns: Empty (highest occupied row = 10, i.e., no blocks).\n\n### Block Rotations\nThe falling block has four rotations:\n1. **0°**: 2 rows × 3 columns, shape:  \n   Row 0: `00*`  \n   Row 1: `***`  \n2. **90°**: 3 rows × 2 columns, shape:  \n   Row 0: `*0`  \n   Row 1: `*0`  \n   Row 2: `**`  \n3. **180°**: 2 rows × 3 columns, shape:  \n   Row 0: `***`  \n   Row 1: `*00`  \n4. **270°**: 3 rows × 2 columns, shape:  \n   Row 0: `**`  \n   Row 1: `0*`  \n   Row 2: `0*`  \n\n### Placement Strategy\nWe prioritize placing the block in a way that aligns with existing blocks to minimize holes. The 0° rotation (2 rows × 3 columns) is suitable as it matches the width of the existing block cluster (columns 3-5). Placing it at drop coordinate 4 (0-based column 3) ensures it covers columns 3-5, aligning with the existing blocks.\n\n### Landing Calculation\nFor rotation 0° at drop coordinate 4 (0-based column 3):\n- The block covers columns 3-5.\n- The highest occupied rows in these columns are 4 (columns 3-4) and 6 (column 5).\n- The block’s bottom row (row 1 of the block) lands at row 2 (board row), ensuring it rests above existing blocks without overlapping.\n\n### Result\nThe block lands in rows 2-3 of the board, filling columns 3-5 in row 3 and column 5 in row 2. No lines are cleared, but the placement is stable and avoids holes.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block. The current block is a 2x2 square (O tetromino), which has the same shape in all rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°). The goal is to place the block as low as possible to avoid stacking height and maximize future line-clearing potential.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has existing blocks concentrated in columns 4-6, with columns 1-3 and 7-10 mostly empty. The key is to find a column range (leftmost coordinate) where the block can fall to the lowest possible row without overlapping existing blocks.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- Columns 1-3 and 7-10 are almost entirely empty (only column 4 has sparse blocks in rows 3-9, but columns 1-3 are completely empty).\n- The 2x2 block occupies 2 columns and 2 rows. For columns 2 and 3 (leftmost coordinate = 2), these columns are entirely empty from row 0 to row 9. Thus, the block can fall unobstructed to the bottom of the board.\n\n### Placement Calculation:\n- For leftmost coordinate 2, the block spans columns 2 and 3. Since these columns are empty, the block will fall until it reaches the bottom row (row 9). The block will occupy rows 8 and 9 (since it is 2 rows tall), with no overlap of existing blocks.\n\n### Rotation:\nAll rotations of the block are identical, so any rotation angle (e.g., 0°) is valid.\n\nAnswer: 2 0","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations to find a valid placement that avoids overlapping with existing blocks and lands as low as possible.\n\n### Game Board Analysis\nThe board has 10 rows (0 to 9, top to bottom) and 10 columns (1 to 10, left to right). Existing blocks (`*`) are concentrated in the lower-middle columns, with empty spaces in the upper and rightmost columns. Key observations:\n- Columns 1–6 have scattered blocks, but columns 7–10 are mostly empty.\n- No rows are fully filled (score remains 0).\n\n### Current Block Rotations\nThe block has four rotations:\n- **0°**: 2 rows tall, 3 columns wide.

Columns 7–10 are mostly empty, so we focus on these columns. The 90° rotation (2 columns wide) fits well in these columns and can fall to the bottom.\n\n### 90° Rotation (x=8)\n- **Width**: 2 columns (columns 8 and 9, leftmost at x=8).  \n- **Height**: 3 rows.  \n- **Cells**: (y,8), (y+1,8), (y+1,9), (y+2,8).  \n\n### Landing Position\nColumns 8 and 9 are empty except for the bottom row (row 9). The block falls until its bottom row (y+2) reaches row 9 (the board’s bottom). This occurs when:  \n- y+2 = 9 → y = 7.  \n\n### Validation\n- **Row 7, Column 8**: Empty.  \n- **Row 8, Columns 8–9**: Empty.  \n- **Row 9, Column 8**: Empty.  \n\nAll cells are valid, and the block lands at y=7 without overlapping existing blocks.\n\nAnswer: 8 90","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations to find the best placement (drop coordinate and rotation) that allows the block to land as low as possible without overlapping existing blocks or exceeding the top boundary.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 columns and 10 rows (top row 0 to bottom row 9). Existing blocks (`*`) are concentrated in columns 2–6 and 8–9, with gaps in columns 1, 7, and 9. The goal is to place the falling block to land as low as possible.\n\n### Current Block Rotations:\nThe block has four rotations:\n- **0°**: 3 columns wide (shape: `00*` (top row), `***` (bottom row)).\n- **90°**: 2 columns wide (shape: `*0` (top row), `*0` (middle row), `**` (bottom row)).\n- **180°**: 3 columns wide (shape: `***` (top row), `*00` (bottom row)).\n- **270°**: 2 columns wide (shape: `**` (top row), `0*` (middle row), `0*` (bottom row)).\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The 0° rotation (3 columns wide) is suitable for filling gaps in the leftmost columns (1–3), where existing blocks are sparse.\n- Columns 1–3 have minimal existing blocks (mostly empty except rows 8–9, where columns 2–3 have blocks).\n\n### Placement Simulation for 0° Rotation:\nFor 0° rotation (3 columns wide), the leftmost column (`drop_coordinate`) can range from 1 to 8. We focus on `x=1` (columns 1–3):\n- **Row 7 (bottom row of the block)**: Columns 1–3 in row 7 are empty (original row 7: `...**..*..`).\n- **Row 6 (top row of the block)**: Column 3 in row 6 is empty (original row 6: `....**....`).\n\nThe block lands at row 7 (bottom row) and row 6 (top row) without overlapping existing blocks. This is the lowest possible landing position for this rotation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe optimal action is to place the 0° rotation at drop coordinate 1, allowing the block to land as low as possible.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current Tetris board and the falling block's rotations.

Key filled rows include:\n- Row 7: `*****..*..` (columns 1-5, 8 filled)\n- Row 8: `.***...**.` (columns 2-4, 8-9 filled)\n- Row 9: `.*****.*..` (columns 2-6, 8 filled)\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe current block has four rotations:\n- **0°**: 2 rows tall, 3 columns wide (`*00`\/`***`)\n- **90°**: 3 rows tall, 2 columns wide (`**`\/`*0`\/`*0`)\n- **180°**: 2 rows tall, 3 columns wide (`***`\/`00*`)\n- **270°**: 3 rows tall, 2 columns wide (`0*`\/`0*`\/`**`)\n\n### Evaluation of Rotations:\n1. **0° Rotation**: 3 columns wide. Placing it in columns 1-3, 4-6, or 7-9 either overlaps existing blocks or lands too high (e.g., x=1 overlaps row 7; x=4 overlaps row 5). No line clears.\n2. **180° Rotation**: 3 columns wide. Placing it in columns 1-3, 4-6, or 7-9 also overlaps existing blocks (e.g., x=5 overlaps row 7). No line clears.\n3. **270° Rotation**: 2 columns wide. Placing it in columns 1-2, 3-4, or 8-9 overlaps existing blocks (e.g., x=2 overlaps row 7; x=8 overlaps row 8). No line clears.\n4. **90° Rotation**: 2 columns wide. Placing it in columns 2-3 (x=2) allows the block to fall to rows 4-6 without overlapping existing blocks. The block’s squares occupy (4,2), (4,3), (5,2), (6,2), landing low and avoiding the top boundary.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe 90° rotation at x=2 is the optimal move, as it lands the block as low as possible without overlapping existing blocks or exceeding the top boundary.\n\nAnswer: 2 90","\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board, block rotations, and potential landing positions. The goal is to place the block as low as possible while avoiding excessive stacking and aiming to clear lines (though no lines are immediately clearable here).\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 columns (0-9) and 10 rows (0-9, top to bottom). Key observations:\n- Columns 0-5, 7-8 have existing blocks, with varying heights.\n- Columns 6 and 9 are mostly empty (few to no blocks).\n- No row is fully filled (score remains 0).\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe current block has two unique rotations:\n- **0°\/180°**: 2 rows high, 3 columns wide. Shape:  \n  Row 0: `**0`  \n  Row 1: `0**`  \n- **90°\/270°**: 3 rows high, 2 columns wide. Shape:  \n  Row 0: `0*`  \n  Row 1: `**`  \n  Row 2: `*0`  \n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **0°\/180°** (3 columns wide) can drop in columns 1-8. It lands higher due to existing blocks in most columns.\n- **90°\/270°** (2 columns wide) can drop in columns 1-9. Columns 6 and 7 are mostly empty, allowing deeper placement.\n\n### Optimal Move:\nFor **90° rotation** (same as 270°), dropping in column 7 (leftmost column 7, board column 6) allows the block to land deeply in the empty column 6 and adjacent column 7. The block’s shape fits into the empty space, minimizing stack height increase.\n\n### Placement Details:\n- **Rotation**: 90° (shape: `0*`\/`**`\/`*0`).\n- **Drop Coordinate**: 7 (leftmost column 7, board column 6).\n- The block covers columns 6 and 7, landing at rows 5-7 (top row 5, bottom row 7), filling empty spaces without overlapping existing blocks.\n\nAnswer: 7 90","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current Tetris board, the falling block's rotations, and potential landing positions. The goal is to place the block such that it lands stably, avoids exceeding the top boundary, and ideally clears rows (though no rows are close to being fully filled in this case).\n\n### Current Board and Block Analysis\n- **Board**: 10 columns (1-10) and 10 rows (top row 0 to bottom row 9). The board has scattered filled cells (`*`), with no rows close to being fully filled (max 7 filled cells in row 7).\n- **Falling Block**: The block has four rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°). Key observations:\n  - **0°**: 2 rows high, 3 columns wide. Cells: (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) (local coordinates).\n  - **90°**: 3 rows high, 2 columns wide. Cells: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (2,0).\n  - **180°**: 2 rows high, 3 columns wide. Cells: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2).\n  - **270°**: 3 rows high, 2 columns wide. Cells: (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1).\n\n### Key Considerations\n- **Stability**: The block must land on existing cells or the bottom of the board.\n- **Avoiding Holes**: Place the block to minimize gaps between filled cells.\n- **Row Clearing**: No rows are close to being fully filled, so priority is stable placement.\n\n### Evaluation of Rotations and Positions\n1. **0° Rotation**:  \n   The 0° block (3 columns wide) can be placed in columns 1-8 (1-based). Testing column 6 (1-based, x=5 0-based) as a candidate:\n   - **Columns 5-7 (0-based 5-7)**: These columns have mostly empty cells in the upper rows. The block will land at row 3 (0-based y=3), with cells at (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7). This placement avoids holes and stabilizes the block.\n\n2. **Other Rotations**:  \n   Rotations 90°, 180°, and 270° either create gaps, land in less stable positions, or do not improve the board structure compared to 0°.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe optimal action is to place the 0°-rotated block in column 6 (1-based), ensuring stable placement without creating significant gaps.\n\nAnswer: 6 0","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current Tetris board, the falling block's rotations, and potential landing positions. The goal is to place the block such that it lands as low as possible without exceeding the top boundary and ideally fills gaps to prepare for row clears.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Board Analysis**: The board has varying column heights. Columns 1-6 and 8 have significant block coverage, while columns 7, 9, and 10 are relatively sparse. Column 10 is entirely empty, making it a prime target for placement to avoid stacking.\n2. **Block Rotations**: The block has four rotations:\n   - **0°**: 3 columns wide, 2 rows tall (`0*0` over `***`).\n   - **90°**: 2 columns wide, 3 rows tall (`*0` over `**` over `*0`).\n   - **180°**: 3 columns wide, 2 rows tall (`***` over `0*0`).\n   - **270°**: 2 columns wide, 3 rows tall (`0*` over `**` over `0*`).\n\n### Evaluation of Rotations and Positions:\n- **0° and 180°**: These 3-column-wide rotations are less flexible due to the board’s crowded columns (e.g., columns 5-6 have high blocks). Placing them in narrow gaps risks collision with existing blocks.\n- **270°**: Similar to 90°, but mirrored. Testing positions in columns 9-10 (sparse area) shows potential, but the vertical height (3 rows) limits how low it can fall without colliding with row 9’s column 9 block.\n- **90°**: A 2-column-wide, 3-row-tall rotation. Placing it in columns 4-5 (moderately filled) allows the block to fall deeper. Columns 4-5 have lower block heights (row 4 for column 4, row 5 for column 5), enabling the block to land in rows 4-6 without collision.\n\n### Optimal Action:\nThe **90° rotation** placed at **x=4** (leftmost column 4) allows the block to land in rows 4-6 of columns 4-5. This position avoids high stacks, minimizes upward growth, and prepares for future row clears.\n\nAnswer: 4 90","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current Tetris board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands without exceeding the top boundary and ideally clears lines (though none are close to being full here).\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 rows (top to bottom) and 10 columns (left to right). The current block has two distinct shapes:  \n- **0°\/180°**: 3 columns wide, 2 rows high, with squares at positions (y, x+1), (y, x+2), (y+1, x), (y+1, x+1).  \n- **90°\/270°**: 2 columns wide, 3 rows high, with squares at positions (y_start, x), (y_start+1, x), (y_start+1, x+1), (y_start+2, x+1).  \n\n### Key Observations:\n- No rows are close to being fully occupied (max 7 filled squares in row 7), so line clears are not possible.  \n- The priority is to place the block in a low, stable position to avoid stacking too high.  \n\n### Candidate Move: 0° Rotation at x=6\nFor the 0° rotation (3 columns wide), the leftmost column (x=6) covers columns 6, 7, 8. The block’s squares are:  \n- (y, 7), (y, 8) (top row of the block).  \n- (y+1, 6), (y+1, 7) (bottom row of the block).  \n\n### Simulation:\n- **Landing Position**: The block falls until it hits existing blocks or the bottom. Checking from the bottom up, the highest valid y where the block fits without overlapping is y=4 (top row of the block at row 4, bottom row at row 5).  \n- **Overlap Check**: All target positions (row 4, columns 7-8; row 5, columns 6-7) are empty on the current board, confirming a valid placement.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the block at x=6 with 0° rotation is stable and avoids stacking high.  \n\nAnswer: 6 0"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

When dropped, it will land at the bottom (row 9) with its top at row 8.\n\n- **90° and 270° rotations**: The block has a 3-row height and 2-column width, shaped as:\n  ```\n  0*\n  **\n  *0\n  ```\n  This shape occupies 3 rows vertically and 2 columns horizontally. When dropped, it will land at the bottom (row 9) with its top at row 7, resulting in a higher stack compared to 0°\/180°.\n\n### Placement Strategy:\nSince the board is empty, placing the block with the lowest possible stack height is ideal. The 0°\/180° rotation (2 rows high) is preferable over 90°\/270° (3 rows high). Centering the block horizontally (columns 4-6) ensures balanced placement for future moves.\n\n### Final Action:\nDropping the 0°-rotated block at column 4 (leftmost column) places it centered and low, minimizing stack height.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations to find the best placement that maximizes the block's descent while avoiding collisions with existing blocks. \n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 rows (rows 1-10, top to bottom). Existing blocks are in:\n- Row 9: columns 4 and 5 (`...**.....`).\n- Row 10: columns 5 and 6 (`....**....`).\n\n### Current Block Rotations:\nThe block has four rotations, but 0° and 180° are identical, while 90° and 270° are identical. The 0°\/180° rotation has a 3-column width and 2-row height, with cells:  \n`(y, x+1), (y, x+2), (y+1, x), (y+1, x+1)` (where `x` is the leftmost column, and `y` is the top row of the block).\n\n### Key Observations:\nThe goal is to place the block as low as possible (highest `y` value) without overlapping existing blocks. For the 0° rotation (3-column width), we check positions where the block can land in the bottom rows.\n\n### Placement for 0° Rotation at x=7:\n- **Leftmost column (x) = 7** (valid, as 7 + 2 = 9 ≤ 10).\n- The block’s cells are:  \n  `(y, 8), (y, 9), (y+1, 7), (y+1, 8)`.\n\n### Descent Simulation:\n- **y=9**: Cells are `(9, 8), (9, 9), (10, 7), (10, 8)`.  \n  - Row 9 (columns 8-9) and Row 10 (columns 7-8) are empty (no existing blocks here).  \n- **y=10**: Cells would be `(10, 8), (10, 9), (11, 7), (11, 8)`.  \n  - Row 11 is out of bounds (board has only 10 rows), so the block cannot descend further.  \n\nThus, the block lands at `y=9` (rows 9 and 10) without collisions, placing it as low as possible.\n\nAnswer: 7 0","\nTo determine the optimal action for placing the current 2x2 block, we analyze the game board and possible positions. The block is a square (2x2) and does not change shape with rotation, so rotation angle is irrelevant (any rotation, e.g., 0°). \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Board State**: The board has 10 columns. The bottom two rows (rows 8 and 9, 0-indexed) have partial blocks:\n   - Row 8: `...**..**.` (columns 4-5 and 8-9 occupied).\n   - Row 9: `....****..` (columns 5-8 occupied).\n2. **Goal**: Place the block to avoid creating high stacks and prepare for future line clears. Since no row can be fully cleared immediately (current rows have 4-6 occupied cells, and the block adds 4 cells), prioritize filling gaps.\n\n### Analysis of Placement:\nThe block can be placed in any column from 1 to 9 (leftmost column). We focus on filling gaps in the lower rows to minimize stack height. Columns 6-7 (leftmost column = 6) are gaps in row 8 (columns 6-7 are empty) and partially filled in row 9 (columns 6-7 are occupied). The block will fall until it hits the first obstacle or the bottom. \n\nFor column 6 (leftmost column 6), the block covers columns 6-7. The highest obstacle in columns 6-7 is row 9 (occupied). Thus, the block lands at row 7-8 (0-indexed), filling the gap in row 8 and aligning with existing blocks in row 9.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlace the block at leftmost column 6 with rotation 0° (arbitrary, as rotation does not affect the square block).\n\nAnswer: 6 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current Tetris board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands stably without creating gaps, as no complete rows can be cleared with the current block (4 cells).\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has filled cells primarily in the lower rows (rows 7-9, 0-based).

We focus on 0° (simpler shape for stable placement):\n- **0° rotation**: Shape is `**0` (row 0) and `0**` (row 1), spanning 3 columns (width 3) and 2 rows (height 2). The cells are at relative positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2).\n\n### Placement Strategy:\nWe need to place the 0° block such that it lands as low as possible, filling gaps and avoiding holes. The leftmost coordinate (1-based) ranges from 1 to 8 (since width is 3). \n\nFor **leftmost coordinate 5 (1-based)**, the block occupies columns 4-6 (0-based). The highest filled cells in these columns are:\n- Column 4: highest filled at row 8 (0-based)\n- Columns 5-6: highest filled at row 7 (0-based)\n\nThe block will land with its top row at row 5 (0-based), ensuring no overlap with existing blocks.

Rows 6-10 have partial fills, with no complete rows (so no immediate row clears).\n3. **Landing Position**: The block will fall until it hits existing blocks or the bottom. For a 2x2 block, the landing position is determined by the highest occupied cells in its target columns.\n\n### Evaluation of Drop Coordinates:\n- **Columns 1-4**: These columns are mostly empty. Placing the block here would land it at the bottom (rows 9-10), but this does not contribute to building toward future row clears.\n- **Columns 5-6**: Columns 5-6 already have partial fills (rows 6-10). Placing the block here (leftmost column \\( x=5 \\)) will land it in rows 4-5 (since rows 6-10 in columns 5-6 are partially occupied). This continues building up the existing structure, which is strategic for future moves.\n- **Columns 7-9**: These columns have higher existing blocks, so placing the block here would result in overlapping or unstable positions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the block at \\( x=5 \\) (leftmost column 5) with any rotation (since all rotations are identical) is optimal. This positions the block to build on the existing structure in columns 5-6, facilitating future row-clearing opportunities.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations.

No rows are fully occupied (score = 0), so the priority is to place the block in a position that integrates with existing structure.\n\n### Current Block Rotations\n- **0°\/180°**: Shape is `**0` over `0**`, spanning 3 columns (width 3).

Occupies cells: (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0).\n\n### Key Observations\n- The 0° rotation (3-column width) can fit in columns 5-7 (leftmost coordinate `5`), avoiding the densest existing blocks (columns 3-6 in lower rows).\n- Placing the 0° rotation at `x=5` (leftmost column 5) aligns the block with the existing structure in columns 5-7, minimizing holes.\n\n### Placement Validation\nFor 0° rotation at `x=5` (columns 5, 6, 7):\n- The block’s cells are (y,5), (y,6), (y+1,6), (y+1,7).\n- Existing blocks in column 5 start at row 3, so `y` must be < 3 to avoid overlap. The highest valid `y` is 2 (rows 2 and 3 are empty in columns 5-7).\n- Placing the block at `y=2` ensures it lands stably without overlapping existing blocks.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe optimal action is to place the 0°-rotated block at leftmost column 5.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current Tetris board and the falling block's rotations.

Shape:  \n  Row 0: `0*` (covers column \\( x+1 \\))  \n  Row 1: `**` (covers columns \\( x, x+1 \\))  \n  Row 2: `*0` (covers column \\( x \\))  \n\n### Valid Placement for 0° Rotation:\nFor the 0° rotation (3 columns wide), the leftmost coordinate \\( x \\) ranges from 1 to 8. We focus on \\( x=1 \\) (leftmost column 1), where columns 1-3 are empty. The block will fall to the bottom of the board, landing at rows 8 and 9 (since columns 1-3 are empty in these rows).\n\n### Verification:\n- **Row 8**: Original row 8 is `...******.` (columns 4-9 filled). Placing the 0° block at \\( x=1 \\) adds `**0` to columns 1-2 (rows 8), resulting in `.**......`.  \n- **Row 9**: Original row 9 is `....****..` (columns 5-8 filled). Placing the 0° block at \\( x=1 \\) adds `0**` to columns 2-3 (rows 9), resulting in `...**....`.  \n\nThis placement is valid, as all cells are empty before placement, and the block lands without overlapping existing blocks.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current Tetris board and the falling I-block. The board has no complete rows (score remains 0), so the goal is to place the block to avoid creating gaps and set up future line clears. \n\n### Current Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 columns (1-10) and 10 rows (top to bottom: row 0 to row 9). Key observations:\n- Rows 8 and 9 have significant filled blocks but are not complete.\n- Rows 1-7 have scattered blocks in columns 5-7 but are mostly empty elsewhere.\n\n### Block Options:\nThe I-block has two distinct rotations:\n- **0°\/180° (horizontal):** 4 squares in a row (****), spanning 4 columns.\n- **90°\/270° (vertical):** 4 squares in a column (*, *, *, *), spanning 4 rows.\n\n### Horizontal Placement (0°):\nA horizontal block (****) can be placed in columns 1-7 (leftmost coordinate 1-7). We focus on placing it as low as possible to minimize gaps. For example, placing it at **x=3** (columns 3-6) allows it to fall to row 7, where columns 3-6 are empty. This avoids overlapping with existing blocks in lower rows and fills a gap in row 7.\n\n### Vertical Placement (90°):\nA vertical block (*, *, *, *) can be placed in any column (1-10) but requires 4 consecutive empty rows. However, most columns have scattered filled blocks, making vertical placement less optimal for minimizing gaps compared to horizontal placement.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the horizontal block (0° rotation) at leftmost coordinate 3 (columns 3-6) in row 7 is a valid and strategic move, as it fills empty space without creating new gaps.\n\nAnswer: 3 0","\nTo solve this Tetris problem, we need to determine the optimal placement of the current 2x2 block (which is rotationally symmetric, so all rotations are identical) such that it lands without causing a game over (i.e., not exceeding the top boundary) and ideally sets up for future line clears. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Block Shape**: The current block is a 2x2 square, so all rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) are identical. The rotation angle does not affect the block's shape.\n2. **Board Analysis**: The board has several filled rows, but no complete rows (which would clear and increase the score). The goal is to place the block in a valid column (1-10) where it lands without overlapping with existing blocks above the top boundary.\n3. **Valid Columns**: Columns 1, 7, 8, and 9 are valid. Columns 3-6 are invalid because placing the block there would overlap with existing blocks in the top row (row 0), causing the game to end. Column 2 is also invalid due to similar overlap issues.\n\n### Placement Evaluation:\n- **Column 1 (X=1)**: The block covers columns 0 and 1 (0-based). The highest filled rows in these columns are row 8 (column 0) and row 8 (column 1). The block lands in rows 6 and 7 (0-based), filling these rows in columns 0 and 1. No lines are cleared, but the placement is valid.\n- **Columns 7-9 (X=7, 8, 9)**: These columns are also valid but do not clear lines either. However, placing the block in column 1 is a straightforward choice as it avoids the more crowded central columns.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAny valid column (1, 7, 8, 9) and rotation (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) works. Here, we choose column 1 with rotation 0° for simplicity.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current Tetris board and the falling block. The current block is an I-block, which can be horizontal (0° or 180°) or vertical (90° or 270°). The goal is to place the block without exceeding the top boundary (game over) and ideally set up for future line clears.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 rows (top to bottom: rows 0–9) and 10 columns (1–10). Existing blocks (`*`) are distributed unevenly, with denser regions in columns 2, 4–7, and 1–2\/7–8 in lower rows. No rows are fully filled (score remains 0), so immediate line clears are not possible.\n\n### Block Rotations:\n- **Horizontal (0°\/180°)**: 4 blocks in a row (width 4, height 1). Placing these requires 4 consecutive empty columns in a row. However, many columns are partially filled, and placing horizontally risks landing in the top row (row 0), causing a game over.\n- **Vertical (90°\/270°)**: 4 blocks stacked vertically (width 1, height 4). These are safer as they occupy 1 column and can fit into empty vertical spaces.\n\n### Valid Moves for Vertical Blocks:\nVertical blocks (90°\/270°) require a column with at least 4 consecutive empty rows. Key columns with sufficient vertical space:\n- **Column 9**: All rows (0–9) are empty. A vertical block here will fall to the bottom, occupying rows 6–9 (since the bottom is row 9, the block spans rows 6–9). This is safe and avoids collisions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the vertical block (90° rotation) in column 9 is a valid, safe move that avoids game over and positions the block to potentially contribute to future line clears.\n\nAnswer: 9 90","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands without exceeding the top boundary and ideally positions the block to avoid excessive stacking.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 rows (0-9, top to bottom) and 10 columns (1-10). Key observations:\n- Columns 3-6 in the top rows (0-1) are heavily occupied.\n- Columns 1-2 in rows 6-8 are occupied.\n- Columns 6-7 in rows 2, 6-9 are occupied.\n- Columns 9 in rows 4-7 are occupied.\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe block has two unique rotations (0°\/180° and 90°\/270°). The 90° rotation (shape: `*0\\n**\\n0*`) is 2 columns wide and 3 rows tall, making it suitable for narrower gaps.\n\n### Placement Evaluation:\nFor the 90° rotation (width 2, height 3), we evaluate possible leftmost columns (x) where the block can land:\n- **x=7**: Columns 7 and 8. Column 7 has its highest occupied cell at row 2, and column 8 at row 8. The block can fall to row 0 (topmost valid row) without overlapping existing blocks.\n\n### Simulation:\nPlacing the 90° block at x=7 (leftmost column 7) results in the block occupying:\n- (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), (2,8) (rows 0-2, columns 7-8). This placement is valid, as these cells are empty, and the block lands without exceeding the top boundary.\n\nAnswer: 7 90","\nTo determine the optimal action for the given Tetris game, we analyze the current board and the falling block. The block is a 2x2 square (all rotations are identical), so the rotation angle does not affect the block's shape. The goal is to place the block such that it lands without exceeding the top boundary and avoids unnecessary stacking.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Block Characteristics**: The block is 2 columns wide and 2 rows tall, with all rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) being identical. Thus, the rotation angle is irrelevant, and we focus on the drop coordinate.\n2. **Board Analysis**: The board has no fully filled rows (score remains 0), so no lines will be cleared regardless of placement. The priority is to place the block in a column where it lands without causing immediate game over (i.e., not exceeding the top boundary).\n3. **Valid Columns**: We check columns 1-10 (1-based) to find a valid drop coordinate. The block spans 2 columns, so the leftmost coordinate ranges from 1 to 9 (since a 2-column block in column 10 would exceed the board).\n\n### Drop Coordinate Evaluation:\n- **Column 9 (1-based)**: This corresponds to columns 8 and 9 (0-based). Checking from the bottom up:\n  - Rows 9 (bottom) and 8: Columns 8 and 9 are empty (rows 9: `.**.****..` → columns 8-9: `..`; row 8: `**.*.****.` → columns 8-9: `..`).\n  - The block can land here without overlapping existing blocks or exceeding the top boundary. Placing the block in column 9 (1-based) with any rotation (e.g., 0°) is valid.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe optimal action is to drop the block in column 9 (1-based) with any rotation (0° is chosen here as a default).\n\nAnswer: 9 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board, the falling block's rotations, and potential landing positions. The goal is to place the block such that it lands without overlapping existing blocks and maximizes future line-clearing opportunities.\n\n### Board Analysis\nThe board has 10 columns (1-10) and 10 rows (1-10, top to bottom). Key observations:\n- Columns 5-7 are heavily filled in the top rows (row 1 has `..*****...`, filling columns 3-7).\n- Columns 1-2 are filled from row 7 downward (rows 7-9 have `**...**.*.`).\n- Column 3 is mostly empty except for row 10.\n- Column 4 is filled from row 9 downward.\n\n### Block Rotations\nThe current block has four rotations:\n- **0°**: 3x3 block with squares at (row 1, col 3), (row 2, cols 1-3).\n- **90°**: 4x2 block with squares at (row 1, col 1), (row 2, col 1), (row 3, cols 1-2).\n- **180°**: 3x3 block with squares at (row 1, cols 1-3), (row 2, col 1).\n- **270°**: 4x2 block with squares at (row 1, cols 1-2), (row 2, col 2), (row 3, col 2).\n\n### Optimal Placement\nFocusing on the 0° rotation (3x3 block), we evaluate placement in columns where the block can land without overlapping:\n- **X=3 (columns 3-5)**: Columns 3 (empty until row 10), 4 (empty until row 9), and 5 (filled at row 1 but empty below row 1). The block lands at row 8 (R=8), with squares at (row 7, col 5), (row 8, cols 3-5). This avoids overlapping existing blocks and fills gaps in the lower-middle rows.\n\n### Conclusion\nPlacing the 0° rotation at X=3 is the best move, as it lands safely without overlapping and positions the block to support future line clears.\n\nAnswer: 3 0"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The goal is to place the block as low as possible while avoiding collisions with existing blocks.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 columns. Existing blocks are in:\n- Row 8 (column 5: `*`)\n- Row 9 (columns 4-6: `***`).\n\n### Current Block Rotations:\n- **0°\/180°**: A 2x3 block with squares at (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1) (relative to the block's top-left corner).\n- **90°\/270°**: A 3x2 block with squares at (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1) (relative to the block's top-left corner).\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The 0°\/180° rotation (2x3 shape) is wider and can be placed lower due to its shorter height (2 rows) compared to the 90°\/270° rotation (3 rows tall).\n- The lowest possible landing position for the 0° rotation is row 9 (the bottom row), as it avoids collisions with existing blocks in rows 8 and 9.\n\n### Valid Placement for 0° Rotation:\nFor the 0° rotation (2x3 shape), the leftmost column (drop coordinate) must be such that the block fits within the board (columns 1-8). Testing drop coordinate **2**:\n- Columns covered: 2, 3, 4 (leftmost column 2).\n- The block’s squares land at:\n  - (row 8, column 3), (row 8, column 4) (top row of the block).\n  - (row 9, column 2), (row 9, column 3) (bottom row of the block).\n- These positions are empty in the current board, allowing the block to land at row 9 without collisions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the 0° rotation at drop coordinate 2 is optimal, as it lands the block at the lowest possible row (row 9) without overlapping existing blocks.\n\nAnswer: 2 0","\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal action for placing the current Tetris block on the given game board. The goal is to choose a rotation and drop coordinate such that the block lands as low as possible without overlapping existing blocks and without exceeding the top boundary of the board.\n\n### Analysis of the Game Board and Block\nThe game board has 10 columns and 10 rows (0-based index from top to bottom). The current board has blocks in rows 8 and 9:\n- Row 8: `..***.....` (columns 2, 3, 4 are occupied).\n- Row 9: `.*****....` (columns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are occupied).\n\nThe current block has four rotations, but 0° and 180° are identical, and 90° and 270° are identical. The 90° rotation of the block is:\n```\n0*\n**\n*0\n```\nThis block spans 2 columns (width) and 3 rows (height). The cells occupied by the 90° block are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), and (2,0) in local coordinates (block rows and columns).\n\n### Determining the Drop Coordinate and Rotation\nWe need to find a valid leftmost column (1-based) and rotation such that the block lands without overlapping existing blocks. For the 90° rotation, the block’s width is 2 columns, so the leftmost column (1-based) can range from 1 to 9. \n\nConsidering the highest occupied rows in the board columns, we analyze the 90° rotation placed at column 3 (1-based, 0-based left = 2). The block covers columns 2 and 3 (0-based). The highest occupied rows in these columns are row 8 (for both columns 2 and 3). \n\nThe block will land when it can no longer fall further. Calculations show the maximum landing row (top row of the block on the board) is 5 (0-based), meaning the block occupies rows 5, 6, and 7 (0-based) on the board. This placement is valid and does not overlap existing blocks.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe chosen action is to rotate the block by 90° and drop it in the 3rd column (1-based).\n\nAnswer: 3 90","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands without exceeding the top boundary and fits into the existing structure.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 rows (0 to 9, top to bottom). Rows 0-4 are mostly empty, while rows 5-9 have partial blocks:\n- Row 5: `...*......` (column 3 occupied)\n- Row 6: `..**......` (columns 2-3 occupied)\n- Row 7: `..*.......` (column 2 occupied)\n- Row 8: `..***.....` (columns 2-4 occupied)\n- Row 9: `.*****....` (columns 1-5 occupied)\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe block has four rotations:\n- **0°**: Shape is `0*0` (top row) and `***` (bottom row), covering 3 columns (width 3) and 2 rows (height 2).\n- **90°**: Shape is `*0`, `**`, `*0` (3 rows, height 3; 2 columns, width 2).\n- **180°**: Shape is `***` (top row) and `0*0` (bottom row), same width\/height as 0°.\n- **270°**: Shape is `0*`, `**`, `0*` (3 rows, height 3; 2 columns, width 2).\n\n### Key Observations:\n- Rows 0-4 are empty, so the block can fall freely until it hits rows 5-9.\n- The 0° rotation (width 3) fits well into the existing structure in columns 2-4, where rows 5-9 have partial blocks. Placing it here will build up the lower rows without exceeding the top boundary.\n\n### Placement for 0° Rotation:\nFor 0° rotation, the block spans 3 columns (leftmost column \\( x \\), 1-based). Choosing \\( x = 3 \\) (1-based) aligns the block with columns 2-4 (0-based), which are partially filled in rows 5-9. The block will fall until it lands in row 4 (top row of the block at \\( t = 3 \\)), with its bottom row at \\( t + 1 = 4 \\). This placement avoids collisions with existing blocks and fits into the structure.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe optimal action is to place the 0°-rotated block at column 3 (1-based).\n\nAnswer: 3 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block in a position that avoids exceeding the top boundary and minimizes stack height. \n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has empty columns 7-10, making them ideal for placement to avoid increasing the existing stack height (which is highest in columns 3-5). \n\n### Block Rotations:\n- **270° Rotation**: The block shape is:  \n  `0*`  \n  `0*`  \n  `**`  \n  This rotation is 3 rows tall and 2 columns wide. The leftmost square (column 0 of the block) aligns with the board's column when placed at `x`.\n\n### Placement Strategy:\nPlacing the 270° rotation in columns 7-8 (leftmost at `x=7`) ensures the block falls to the bottom (row 10) without overlapping existing blocks. The block occupies:\n- Row 8, column 8 (top row of the block).\n- Row 9, column 8 (middle row of the block).\n- Rows 10, columns 7-8 (bottom row of the block).\n\nThis placement is safe, avoids the existing stack, and keeps the board's height low.\n\nAnswer: 7 270","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's possible placements. The board has 10 rows (top to bottom) and 10 columns (left to right). The falling block is a straight line, which can be horizontal (0°\/180°: 4 columns wide, 1 row high) or vertical (90°\/270°: 1 column wide, 4 rows high). The goal is to place the block without exceeding the top boundary and to avoid unnecessary clutter.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Board State**: The bottom rows (rows 4–10) have scattered filled squares, but no row is close to being fully occupied (maximum 7 filled squares in row 10). Placing the block cannot clear any rows.\n2. **Horizontal Block (0°\/180°)**: A horizontal block (4 columns wide) would require 4 consecutive empty columns in a row. However, the board’s lower rows have limited empty columns, and placing a horizontal block would fill gaps but not meaningfully contribute to future row clears.\n3. **Vertical Block (90°\/270°)**: A vertical block (1 column wide, 4 rows high) is ideal for filling empty columns without creating unnecessary clutter. Columns 1 and 10 are completely empty, making them optimal for vertical placement.\n\n### Optimal Placement:\nPlacing the vertical block (90° rotation) in column 1 (leftmost column) ensures it falls to the bottom without overlapping existing blocks. This fills an empty column, avoids blocking critical gaps, and keeps the board balanced for future moves.\n\nAnswer: 1 90","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current Tetris board and the falling block's possible rotations and positions. The goal is to place the block such that it lands as low as possible, avoids exceeding the top boundary, and maximizes future opportunities (e.g., clearing lines).\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 rows (0-based 0 to 9), with the bottom row (row 9) completely filled (`**********`). Any block placement will trigger a line clear for row 9, increasing the score by 1. The key is to place the block in a position that minimizes gaps and lands as low as possible.\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe current block has two distinct rotations:\n- **0°\/180°**: A 2x3 block with occupied cells at (row 0, col 1), (row 0, col 2), (row 1, col 0), (row 1, col 1).\n- **90°\/270°**: A 3x2 block with occupied cells at (row 0, col 0), (row 1, col 0), (row 1, col 1), (row 2, col 1).\n\n### Placement Evaluation:\n#### 0° Rotation (2x3):\n- Width: 3 columns. Possible leftmost positions: 1-8 (1-based).\n- For example, placing at leftmost column 3 (0-based column 2) results in the block landing at row 1 (0-based), leaving significant gaps above.\n\n#### 90° Rotation (3x2):\n- Width: 2 columns. Possible leftmost positions: 1-9 (1-based).\n- Placing at leftmost column 5 (0-based column 4) allows the block to land lower. The block’s cells (row 2, col 4), (row 3, col 4), (row 3, col 5), (row 4, col 5) avoid collisions with existing blocks and land at row 2 (0-based), which is lower than the 0° rotation’s landing position.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the 90°-rotated block at leftmost column 5 (1-based) lands it lower, fills gaps effectively, and triggers the line clear for row 9.\n\nAnswer: 5 90","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current Tetris board and the falling block (a 2x2 square, O-tetromino, which is rotationally symmetric). The goal is to place the block such that it clears a row if possible, maximizing the score.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 rows (top to bottom: rows 0 to 9). The bottom row (row 9) is mostly filled: `********..` (columns 0-7 filled, columns 8-9 empty). The falling block is 2x2, so it occupies 2 consecutive columns and 2 consecutive rows.\n\n### Key Insight:\nClearing a row requires filling all 10 columns in a row. The bottom row (row 9) has 8 filled columns (0-7) and 2 empty columns (8-9). Placing the 2x2 block in columns 8-9 (1-based drop coordinate 9) will fill the remaining empty columns in row 9, completing the row.\n\n### Placement Validation:\n- **Drop Coordinate 9 (1-based):** This positions the block in columns 8-9 (0-based). The block will fall to the bottom of the board, occupying rows 8 and 9, columns 8 and 9.\n- **Row 9 After Placement:** The original row 9 is `********..` (columns 0-7 filled). Adding the block fills columns 8-9, making row 9 `**********` (all 10 columns filled). This triggers a row clear, increasing the score by 1.\n\n### Rotation:\nSince the block is a 2x2 square, all rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) are identical. Any rotation angle is valid.\n\nAnswer: 9 0","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block. The board has gaps in several columns, and the goal is to place the block (an I-block) to avoid exceeding the top boundary and to set up for future line clears.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Board State**: The bottom rows (rows 7-10) have scattered blocks, with columns 2, 6, and 7 mostly empty.\n- **Block Rotations**: The I-block can be horizontal (0° or 180°, spanning 4 columns) or vertical (90° or 270°, spanning 4 rows).\n- **Vertical Placement**: A vertical I-block (90° or 270°) in an empty column (e.g., column 2) will fall to the bottom, occupying 4 consecutive rows (rows 7-10 in column 2). This avoids overlapping with existing blocks and fills a gap without creating holes.\n\n### Analysis of Vertical Placement (90° Rotation):\n- **Column 2**: This column is entirely empty (no existing blocks). A vertical I-block placed in column 2 will fall until it hits the bottom row (row 10), occupying rows 7-10 in column 2. This is valid and safe, as it does not exceed the top boundary.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the vertical I-block in column 2 (leftmost coordinate 2) with a 90° rotation is optimal, as it fills a gap and avoids obstructions.\n\nAnswer: 2 90","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands without exceeding the top boundary and maximizes potential line clears (though none are immediately possible here).\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 rows (0-9, top to bottom) with existing blocks in lower rows. Key observations:\n- Rows 0-2 are empty.\n- Row 3 has a block at column 4.\n- Rows 4-5 have blocks in columns 3-5.\n- Row 6 has blocks in columns 1 and 3.\n- Rows 7-9 have blocks in columns 0-3 (and additional blocks in rows 8-9).\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe block has two distinct rotations:\n- **0°\/180° (Shape A)**: 2 rows tall, 3 columns wide, with blocks at (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1).\n- **90°\/270° (Shape B)**: 3 rows tall, 2 columns wide, with blocks at (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1).\n\n### Placement Evaluation:\nWe need to find a valid drop coordinate and rotation where the block lands without overlapping existing blocks or exceeding the top boundary. \n\n#### Shape B (90°\/270°):\nThis rotation is 3 rows tall and 2 columns wide. Testing drop coordinate \\( x = 3 \\) (1-based, leftmost column 3, 0-based column 2) places the block in columns 2 and 3. The block’s cells are:\n- (r, 2), (r+1, 2), (r+1, 3), (r+2, 3).\n\nThe highest existing blocks in columns 2 and 3 are in row 5 (column 2) and row 4 (column 3). The block falls until it lands just above these, with \\( r = 1 \\) (top row of the block at row 1). This placement is valid, as all cells (rows 1-3, columns 2-3) are empty.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the 90°-rotated block at drop coordinate 3 ensures it lands safely without overlapping existing blocks or exceeding the top boundary.\n\nAnswer: 3 90","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current Tetris board and the falling block (a 2x2 square, unchanged by rotation). The goal is to place the block such that it clears a row if possible, as clearing rows increases the score.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The block is a 2x2 square, so rotation has no effect (all rotations are identical).\n- The board has 10 columns (1-10). The block occupies 2 columns, so the drop coordinate ranges from 1 to 9.\n- Row 9 (bottom row) is partially filled: `*****..***` (columns 1-5 and 8-10 are filled, columns 6-7 are empty). Adding the 2x2 block to columns 6-7 in rows 8-9 will fill the remaining empty columns in row 9, clearing the row.\n\n### Analysis of Drop Coordinate 6:\n- **Columns 6-7**: These columns in row 9 are empty (`..` in `*****..***`). Placing the block here will fill columns 6-7 in row 9.\n- **Rows 8-9**: Row 8 has `***....*..` (columns 1-3 and 8 are filled, columns 6-7 are empty). The block fits in columns 6-7 of row 8 (empty) and row 9 (empty).\n- **Result**: After placing the block at drop coordinate 6 (columns 6-7) with any rotation, row 9 becomes fully filled (`**********`), which clears the row and increases the score.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe optimal move is to drop the block at column 6 with any rotation (since rotation does not affect the 2x2 square).\n\nAnswer: 6 0","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal action for placing the current Tetris block, we analyze the game board, block rotations, and possible landing positions. The goal is to place the block such that it lands without exceeding the top boundary and ideally sets up for future line clears (though no immediate line clears are possible here).\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Board Analysis**: The current board has no fully filled rows (all rows have fewer than 10 occupied cells). The highest occupied cells in each column vary, with columns 0–3 having higher occupied rows (rows 1–7) and columns 7–9 having lower occupied rows (rows 8–9).\n2. **Block Rotations**: The block has four rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°). Each rotation has distinct dimensions and coverage:\n   - **0°**: 3 columns wide, 2 rows tall (shape: `*00` over `***`).\n   - **90°**: 2 columns wide, 3 rows tall (shape: `**` over `*0` over `*0`).\n   - **180°**: 3 columns wide, 2 rows tall (shape: `***` over `00*`).\n   - **270°**: 2 columns wide, 3 rows tall (shape: `0*` over `0*` over `**`).\n\n### Evaluation of Rotations and Positions:\n- **0° Rotation**: The block covers 3 columns and 2 rows. Placing it at `x=5` (1-based, leftmost column 5) aligns with columns 4–6 (0-based). The highest occupied cells in these columns are row 3 (column 4), row 2 (column 5), and row 2 (column 6). The block lands at row 0 (top row of the block), with its bottom row at row 1. This placement fills row 0, column 4, and row 1, columns 4–6, avoiding gaps and compactly filling lower rows.\n- Other rotations (90°, 180°, 270°) either result in less compact placements, higher landing rows, or gaps, making 0° rotation at `x=5` the most optimal.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best action is to place the block at leftmost column 5 with 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands stably, avoids exceeding the top boundary, and ideally sets up for future line clears.\n\n### Current Board Analysis\nThe board has 10 columns (0-9) and 10 rows (0-9, top to bottom). Key observations:\n- Row 9 (bottom row) has 8 filled cells (columns 0-4, 7-9), missing columns 5 and 6.\n- Other rows have fewer filled cells, with no immediate line-clearing opportunities.\n\n### Block Rotations\nThe block has two unique rotations:\n- **0°\/180°**: 3 columns wide (cells: (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1) in local coordinates).\n- **90°\/270°**: 2 columns wide (cells: (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1) in local coordinates).\n\n### Simulation of Moves\n#### 90° Rotation (2 columns wide)\nFor 90° rotation, the block covers columns \\(X-1\\) and \\(X\\) (where \\(X\\) is the leftmost board column, 1-10). The block’s cells in the board are:  \n\\((r, X-1)\\), \\((r+1, X-1)\\), \\((r+1, X)\\), \\((r+2, X)\\) (rows \\(r, r+1, r+2\\)).  \n\n### Optimal Placement\nTo target row 9 (closest to full), we aim to fill missing columns 5 and 6. Placing the 90° rotation at \\(X=5\\) (leftmost column 5) covers columns 4 and 5. The block lands at \\(r=7\\) (top row of the block), with:\n- \\((7,4)\\), \\((8,4)\\), \\((8,5)\\), \\((9,5)\\) filled.  \n\nThis placement fills column 5 in row 9 (reducing its empty cells to 1) and avoids overlapping existing blocks. It is stable and sets up for future line clears.\n\nAnswer: 5 90"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

When placed with leftmost coordinate `x`, the block occupies:\n  - Row 9 (top of the block): Column `x`\n  - Row 10 (bottom of the block): Columns `x`, `x+1`, `x+2`  \n  Valid `x` ranges from 1 to 8 (since 3 columns fit within 10 total columns).\n\n- **90° Rotation**: The block has a 3-row height and 2-column width.

The board has 10 columns and 10 rows, with existing blocks in row 9 (column 4) and row 10 (columns 4-6). The current block is an I-block with rotations: 0° (horizontal, ****), 90° (vertical, four stacked *), 180° (same as 0°), and 270° (same as 90°).\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Horizontal Placement (0° or 180°):** The horizontal I-block (****) spans 4 columns. Placing it in columns 7-10 (leftmost coordinate 7) allows it to fall to the bottom row (row 10) since columns 7-10 are empty. This maximizes the block’s contribution to row 10, which already has blocks in columns 4-6.\n2. **Vertical Placement (90° or 270°):** The vertical I-block (four stacked *) spans 4 rows. Placing it vertically would only fill a single column, which is less effective for building toward a full row compared to horizontal placement.\n3. **Landing Row Calculation:** For the horizontal block in columns 7-10, all columns 7-10 are empty, so the block lands in row 10 (the bottom row). This fills columns 7-10 in row 10, complementing the existing blocks in columns 4-6.\n\n### Optimal Action:\nPlacing the horizontal I-block (0° rotation) at leftmost coordinate 7 fills columns 7-10 in row 10, increasing the number of filled columns in row 10 from 3 to 7. This builds toward a future line clear.\n\nAnswer: 7 0","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands as low as possible and potentially clears a row to increase the score.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 rows (0 to 9, top to bottom). Row 9 (bottom row) has 7 filled cells (columns 4-10), and row 8 has a single filled cell in column 4. All rows above row 8 are empty.\n\n### Block Rotations:\n- **0°**: 3 columns wide, 2 rows tall. Shape:  \n  Row 1: `0*0` (only column 2 is filled)  \n  Row 2: `***` (columns 1-3 are filled)  \n- **90°**: 2 columns wide, 3 rows tall.  \n- **180°**: 3 columns wide, 2 rows tall (reverse of 0°).  \n- **270°**: 2 columns wide, 3 rows tall.  \n\n### Key Insight:\nRow 9 has 7 filled cells (columns 4-10) and 3 empty cells (columns 1-3). Placing the 0° rotation (which fills columns 1-3 in its bottom row) at column 1 (leftmost) will fill the empty columns 1-3 in row 9. This completes row 9 (all 10 columns filled), triggering a row clear and increasing the score by 1.\n\n### Validation:\n- **0° rotation at x=1**: The block’s bottom row (row 2 of the block) aligns with row 9 of the board, filling columns 1-3. The top row of the block (row 1 of the block) aligns with row 8, column 2 (empty in row 8).  \n- After placement, row 9 becomes fully filled (columns 1-10), which is cleared.  \n\nAnswer: 1 0","\nTo determine the optimal action for placing the current Tetris block, we analyze the game board and block characteristics. The current block is a 2x2 square (O-tetromino), which is rotationally symmetric (all rotations are identical). The goal is to place the block such that it lands stably without exceeding the board boundaries.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 rows, with the bottom row (row 10) currently having occupied cells at columns 2 and 4 (represented as `.*.*......`). All other rows (1-9) are completely empty (all `.`).\n\n### Block Placement:\nThe O-tetromino is 2 columns wide and 2 rows tall. The drop coordinate specifies the leftmost column of the block, ranging from 1 to 9 (since a 2-column-wide block requires at least 2 columns). The block will fall until it hits the bottom of the board or existing blocks.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The O-tetromino’s shape is unchanged by rotation, so any rotation angle (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) is equivalent.\n- The block can be placed in any column from 1 to 9. For example, placing it in column 5 (leftmost) will position the block across columns 5 and 6. Since rows 1-9 are empty, the block will fall to the bottom (row 10) and occupy rows 9 and 10, columns 5 and 6. This is a valid and stable placement.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAny valid drop coordinate (1-9) with any rotation angle is acceptable. A reasonable choice is column 5 with rotation 0° (arbitrary rotation due to symmetry).\n\nAnswer: 5 0","\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal action (drop coordinate and rotation angle) for placing the current Tetris block on the given board. The goal is to place the block such that it lands as low as possible without overlapping existing blocks, and to maximize future opportunities for clearing rows.\n\n### Analysis of the Game Board and Block\nThe game board has 10 columns (1-based) and 10 rows (top to bottom). The current board has filled cells in:\n- Row 9 (bottom row): columns 2, 4, 5, 6.\n- Row 8: columns 5, 6.\n\nThe current block has four possible rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°). We analyze each rotation to determine the best placement.\n\n### Key Observations\n1. **0° Rotation**: The block is 3 columns wide and 2 rows tall. It covers columns \\( x, x+1, x+2 \\) (leftmost column \\( x \\)) and rows \\( y-1 \\) (top) and \\( y \\) (bottom). Placing this block requires checking for collisions in these columns and rows.\n2. **90° Rotation**: The block is 2 columns wide and 3 rows tall. It covers columns \\( x, x+1 \\) and rows \\( y-2 \\), \\( y-1 \\), \\( y \\) (bottom row \\( y \\)). This rotation allows the block to land lower due to its vertical orientation.\n3. **180° Rotation**: Similar to 0° but mirrored. It is 3 columns wide and 2 rows tall, with a different distribution of filled cells.\n4. **270° Rotation**: Similar to 90° but mirrored. It is 2 columns wide and 3 rows tall, with a different distribution of filled cells.\n\n### Optimal Placement\nThe 90° rotation is chosen because it allows the block to land lower (row 8) compared to other rotations. For \\( x = 2 \\) (leftmost column 2), the block covers columns 2 and 3. The block’s cells are:\n- \\( (y-2, 2) \\), \\( (y-1, 2) \\), \\( (y, 2) \\), \\( (y, 3) \\).\n\nChecking collisions:\n- Row 9 (bottom row) has a filled cell at column 2, so \\( y = 9 \\) is invalid.\n- Row 8 has no filled cells in columns 2 or 3. Rows 7 and 6 (above row 8) are also empty in these columns. Thus, the block can land at \\( y = 8 \\).\n\n### Conclusion\nPlacing the 90°-rotated block at leftmost column 2 allows it to land at row 8 without overlapping existing blocks, making this the optimal action.\n\nAnswer: 2 90","\nTo solve this Tetris problem, we need to determine the optimal placement of the current falling block (an I-block) on the given game board. The goal is to place the block such that it lands as low as possible without exceeding the top boundary, and we also check if any rows are cleared (though none are cleared in this case).\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Board Analysis**: The board has 10 columns and 10 rows. The existing blocks are concentrated in columns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (1-based) across rows 6 to 9.\n2. **Block Rotations**: The I-block has two distinct rotations:\n   - **0°\/180°**: Horizontal (4 columns wide, 1 row tall).\n   - **90°\/270°**: Vertical (1 column wide, 4 rows tall).\n3. **Landing Calculation**: For horizontal placement, the block lands when any of its 4 columns hits an existing block or the bottom. For vertical placement, the block lands when its bottom row hits an existing block or the bottom.\n\n### Horizontal Placement (0°\/180°):\nThe horizontal I-block (****) spans 4 columns. Valid drop coordinates (leftmost column) range from 1 to 7 (since 7 + 3 = 10, fitting within the 10 columns). The lowest landing row for the horizontal block is determined by the highest obstacle in its covered columns. For example, placing the block at drop coordinate 3 (1-based) covers columns 3-6 (1-based) and lands at row 7 (0-based), as this is the highest row where obstacles (existing blocks) are present in the covered columns.\n\n### Vertical Placement (90°\/270°):\nThe vertical I-block (*) spans 4 rows. Valid drop coordinates range from 1 to 10 (since it is 1 column wide). However, vertical placement in columns with existing blocks (e.g., column 2) would land higher, while placement in empty columns (e.g., column 1) would land at the bottom. Despite this, horizontal placement in row 7 (0-based) is more strategic for minimizing height and setting up future lines.\n\n### Optimal Action:\nPlacing the horizontal I-block (0° rotation) at drop coordinate 3 (1-based) is valid and lands the block at row 7 (0-based), which is low and avoids unnecessary height accumulation.\n\nAnswer: 3 0","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands without exceeding the top boundary and maximizes potential line clears (though none are possible here). \n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 rows (0-9, top to bottom) with the following filled cells in lower rows:\n- Row 6: `. * ........` (column 1 filled)\n- Row 7: `. *****....` (columns 1-5 filled)\n- Row 8: `. **. **....` (columns 1-2, 4-5 filled)\n- Row 9: `. *. ***....` (columns 1, 3-5 filled)\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe block has two unique rotations (0°\/180° and 90°\/270°). The 90° rotation (3 rows high, 2 columns wide) is more compact and easier to fit into gaps.\n\n### Valid Placement (90° Rotation, x=3):\n- **Rotation 90°**: The block occupies columns \\( x \\) and \\( x+1 \\) (2 columns wide) and 3 rows high.\n- **Drop Coordinate x=3**: Places the block in columns 3 and 4. The block falls until it collides with existing filled cells. \n\n### Simulation:\nThe block’s cells in 90° rotation at \\( x=3 \\) are:\n- (row \\( r \\), column 3)\n- (row \\( r+1 \\), column 3)\n- (row \\( r+1 \\), column 4)\n- (row \\( r+2 \\), column 4)\n\nIt lands at \\( r=5 \\) (top row of the block) because moving down further would collide with row 7 (column 4 is filled). This placement is valid and does not exceed the top boundary.\n\nAnswer: 3 90","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board, existing block positions, and the possible rotations of the falling block. The goal is to place the block such that it lands stably, avoids creating holes, and sets up for future line clears.\n\n### Board Analysis\nThe board has 10 rows (top to bottom). Key observations about occupied columns:\n- Rows 5–10 have scattered blocks, with no full rows (required for line clears, which add to the score).\n- Rows 1–4 are empty, providing space for the block to fall.\n\n### Block Rotations\nThe current block has two unique rotations:\n1. **0°\/180°**: 3 columns wide, 2 rows tall.

Testing positions \\( x = 1 \\) to \\( x = 10 \\):\n- Most positions collide with existing blocks in lower rows (e.g., \\( x = 2 \\) collides with row 5, column 3; \\( x = 3 \\) collides with row 6, column 3).\n- No positions for this rotation land lower than row 4, leaving gaps and not contributing to line clears.\n\n#### 90°\/270° Rotation (2 columns wide)\nThis rotation covers columns \\( x, x+1 \\) and requires 3 rows vertically. Testing positions \\( x = 1 \\) to \\( x = 10 \\):\n- For \\( x = 2 \\) (columns 2 and 3), the block’s cells are:  \n  - Row \\( r \\): column 3  \n  - Row \\( r+1 \\): columns 2 and 3  \n  - Row \\( r+2 \\): column 2  \n- The block lands at \\( r = 3 \\) (rows 3, 4, 5), as lower rows (e.g., \\( r = 4 \\)) collide with existing blocks in row 5, column 3.  \n- This placement fills columns 2 and 3 in rows 3–5, avoiding holes and compactly building the stack.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe 90° rotation placed at \\( x = 2 \\) (leftmost column 2) is optimal, as it lands stably in lower rows without creating gaps, setting up for future line clears.\n\nAnswer: 2 90","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations.

The highest occupied cells in columns 3-5 are in row 4 (columns 3-4 filled). The block can land in rows 2-3 (top row \\( r=2 \\)), as rows 2-3 are mostly empty.\n- **Result**: The block occupies (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), filling gaps in rows 2-3 without creating holes.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the 0° rotation at \\( x=3 \\) is optimal, as it fits into the available space and avoids unnecessary height increase.\n\nAnswer: 3 0","\nTo determine the optimal move for the given Tetris game, we analyze the current board and the falling block (a 2x2 square, identical across all rotations). The goal is to find a valid drop coordinate (leftmost column) and rotation (which is irrelevant here since all rotations are the same) where the block can land without overlapping existing blocks.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The block is a 2x2 square (O-tetromino), so it occupies 2 rows and 2 columns regardless of rotation.\n- The board has 10 rows (0-9, top to bottom) and 10 columns (1-10, left to right).\n- The block falls until it hits existing blocks or the bottom of the board.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Drop Coordinates:\nWe check each possible leftmost column (1-10) to see where the block can land:\n- **Column 1 (leftmost)**: The block covers columns 1-2. The highest valid row where it can land is row 1 (top row of the block), as the rows below (row 3) contain existing blocks that block further descent.\n- Other columns (4-9) are also valid but less critical since the block’s rotation does not affect placement, and no rows are close to being fully filled (so no line clears are possible).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe leftmost valid drop coordinate is column 1, and any rotation (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) works.

The goal is to place the block such that it fits without overlapping existing blocks and ideally contributes to filling rows for future line clears.\n\n### Current Board Analysis\nThe board has 10 rows (top: row 0, bottom: row 9) and 10 columns (left: column 0, right: column 9). Key observations:\n- Rows 0 is empty.\n- Rows 1–2 have partial fills in columns 0–4.\n- Rows 3–6 have sparse fills (columns 1–3, 5–7).\n- Rows 7–9 have denser fills (columns 1–5, 7–8, 3–7).\n\n### Block Rotations\nThe block has four rotations:\n- **0°**: 2 rows tall, 3 columns wide. Cells: (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2).\n- **90°**: 3 rows tall, 2 columns wide. Cells: (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0).\n- **180°**: 2 rows tall, 3 columns wide. Cells: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,1).\n- **270°**: 3 rows tall, 2 columns wide. Cells: (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1).\n\n### Landing Simulation for 0° Rotation\nThe 0° rotation (2 rows tall, 3 columns wide) is analyzed for placement at column 5 (leftmost coordinate 5). The block spans columns 5–7. \n\n#### Key Checks:\n- **Columns 5–7**: Column 5 has fills starting at row 7; column 6 has fills starting at row 9; column 7 has fills starting at row 8.\n- **Falling Path**: The block starts at row 0 and falls until it hits existing fills or the bottom. It lands when its bottom row (row Y+1) would overlap with existing blocks.\n\n#### Landing Position:\nThe block lands at row Y=5 (top row of the block at row 5). The cells occupied are:\n- (5,6) [top row, column 6]\n- (6,5) [bottom row, column 5]\n- (6,6) [bottom row, column 6]\n- (6,7) [bottom row, column 7]\n\nThese cells are all empty in the current board, ensuring a valid placement without overlap.\n\n### Conclusion\nPlacing the block at column 5 with 0° rotation is optimal, as it fits neatly into the available space and avoids creating gaps in the upper rows.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands without exceeding the top boundary and ideally clears a row (though no row is fully clearable here). \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Board Analysis**: The highest filled rows (HFR) for columns 0-6 are row 1, column 5 is row 0, columns 7-8 are row 8, and column 9 is empty (HFR=10).\n- **Block Rotations**: The 0° rotation of the block is 3 columns wide and 2 rows tall, with cells at (row 0, col 2) and (row 1, cols 0-2) relative to the block's top-left corner.\n\n### Valid Placement for 0° Rotation:\n- **Leftmost Coordinate (x=7)**: This places the block in columns 7, 8, 9. The block’s cells will occupy:\n  - (row 6, col 9) from the top row of the block.\n  - (row 7, cols 7-9) from the bottom row of the block.\n- **Landing Check**: The block falls until it hits the HFR of columns 7-8 (row 8) and column 9 (empty). The highest valid landing row (y=6) ensures the block does not exceed the top boundary.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the 0° rotation at x=7 is valid and avoids game over.\n\nAnswer: 7 0"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The goal is to place the block in a way that promotes a flat stack for future line clears. \n\n### Block Rotations Analysis:\n- **0° Rotation**: The block has a 3-column width (columns \\(x, x+1, x+2\\)) and 2 rows. The bottom row of the block (row 1) is a flat line of three squares (`***`), which is ideal for a stable base. When dropped, it will occupy row 9 (bottom row) with `***` and row 8 with `00*` (placing a single square in column \\(x+2\\)).\n- **90° Rotation**: The block has a 2-column width (columns \\(x, x+1\\)) and 3 rows. The bottom row (row 2) is `**`, which is less stable than a 3-square flat base.\n- **180° Rotation**: Similar to 0° but with the top square in column \\(x\\) instead of \\(x+2\\). It also has a 3-column width and a flat bottom row (`***`).\n- **270° Rotation**: A 2-column width with a single square in the bottom row, leading to an uneven stack.\n\n### Placement Strategy:\nSince the board is empty, the priority is to create a flat base. The 0° rotation provides a 3-square flat bottom (row 9) and minimal height in row 8. Placing it in the middle (columns 4-6) balances the stack and leaves room for future blocks.\n\n### Final Action:\nDrop the 0°-rotated block with the leftmost column at 4, ensuring it fits within the 10-column board and forms a stable base.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block. The board has empty rows 1-8, row 9 with a single '*' in column 6, and row 10 with '***' in columns 4-6. The current block is a line piece with horizontal (0°\/180°: ****) and vertical (90°\/270°: four stacked '*') rotations.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Horizontal Block (0°\/180°)**: The block is 4 columns wide. To land as low as possible, we need columns with no existing blocks to allow the block to fall to the bottom row (row 10). Columns 7-10 are entirely empty in all rows, making them ideal.\n2. **Vertical Block (90°\/270°)**: The block is 4 rows tall. Placing it vertically would occupy a single column but does not contribute to filling rows as effectively as the horizontal block, especially since no rows are close to being full.\n\n### Optimal Placement:\nPlacing the horizontal block (0° rotation) at drop coordinate 7 (leftmost column 7) covers columns 7-10. Since these columns are empty in all rows, the block falls to row 10, filling columns 7-10. This placement is valid, avoids exceeding the top boundary, and positions the block at the lowest possible row.\n\nAnswer: 7 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block. The board has 10 columns, with the bottom two rows (row 10 and row 9) having partial fills: row 10 has 7 filled columns (4-10), and row 9 has 1 filled column (6). The current block is an I-shaped tetromino with horizontal (0°\/180°) and vertical (90°\/270°) orientations.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Horizontal Orientation (0°\/180°)**: The block spans 4 columns. Placing it horizontally would require aligning it with existing fills, but row 10 already has 7 filled columns (4-10), leaving only columns 1-3 empty. However, placing the horizontal block here would not complete a row (needs 10 filled squares) and risks overlapping with existing blocks in row 10 (columns 4-10).\n\n2. **Vertical Orientation (90°\/270°)**: The block spans 4 rows in a single column. Placing it vertically in an empty column (e.g., column 1) avoids overlapping with existing blocks and builds a flat foundation for future moves. Columns 1-3 are empty in row 10, making column 1 a safe choice.\n\n### Best Move:\nPlacing the vertical I-block (90° rotation) in column 1 ensures it falls to the bottom without overlapping existing blocks. This minimizes holes and maintains a flat surface for future tetromino placements.\n\nAnswer: 1 90","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block. The board has 10 columns, with existing blocks concentrated in column 1 (rows 7-10) and row 10 (columns 4-10). The falling block is a straight line, which can be horizontal (0° or 180°: ****) or vertical (90° or 270°: four stacked *).\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Row 10** is partially filled: column 1 and columns 4-10 are occupied (8 filled cells). Clearing this row would increase the score by 1.\n- A horizontal block (****) placed in columns 2-5 of row 10 would fill the remaining empty columns (2-3) in row 10, completing the row.\n\n### Analysis of the Horizontal Block (0°\/180°):\n- The horizontal block (****) spans 4 columns. Placing it at `drop_coordinate = 2` (leftmost column 2) covers columns 2-5.\n- Columns 2 and 3 in row 10 are empty, while columns 4 and 5 in row 10 are already occupied. The block will fall to row 10 (the bottom of the board) since columns 2 and 3 are unobstructed.\n- Placing the block here fills row 10 completely (columns 1-10), triggering a row clear and increasing the score by 1.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe optimal action is to place the horizontal block (0° rotation) at column 2, filling row 10 and clearing it.\n\nAnswer: 2 0","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board, the falling block's rotations, and potential landing positions. The goal is to place the block such that it lands without exceeding the top boundary and ideally fills rows to clear them (though no rows are currently full).\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 columns and 10 rows (top to bottom: rows 1–10). Key observations about filled cells:\n- **Row 7 (topmost filled row)**: Column 0 is filled.\n- **Row 8**: Column 0 is filled.\n- **Row 9**: Columns 0–5 are filled.\n- **Row 10 (bottom row)**: Column 0 and columns 3–9 are filled.\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe block has four rotations:\n1. **0°**: 2 rows high, 3 columns wide. Shape:  \n   Row 0: `*00` (only column 0 filled).  \n   Row 1: `***` (columns 0–2 filled).  \n2. **90°**: 3 rows high, 2 columns wide. Shape:  \n   Row 0: `**` (columns 0–1 filled).  \n   Row 1: `*0` (column 0 filled).  \n   Row 2: `*0` (column 0 filled).  \n3. **180°**: 2 rows high, 3 columns wide. Shape:  \n   Row 0: `***` (columns 0–2 filled).  \n   Row 1: `00*` (column 2 filled).  \n4. **270°**: 3 rows high, 2 columns wide. Shape:  \n   Row 0: `0*` (column 1 filled).  \n   Row 1: `0*` (column 1 filled).  \n   Row 2: `**` (columns 0–1 filled).  \n\n### Optimal Placement:\nWe focus on the **0° rotation** (simplest to analyze) and a leftmost coordinate of **4 (1-based)**. This places the block in columns 3–5 (0-based: 3, 4, 5) on the board.  \n\n#### Landing Check for 0° Rotation at x=4:\n- **Columns 3–5**:  \n  - Column 3: Filled in rows 8–9 (0-based 8–9).  \n  - Column 4: Filled in rows 8–9 (0-based 8–9).  \n  - Column 5: Filled in rows 8–9 (0-based 8–9).  \n- The block’s bottom row (Row 1 of the block) will land just above the highest filled row in these columns (row 8, 0-based). Thus, the block’s top row (Row 0) will be in row 6 (0-based), and the bottom row (Row 1) in row 7 (0-based).  \n\n#### Validation:\n- **Row 6 (0-based)**: Column 3 is empty, so the block’s top row (Row 0, column 3) fits.  \n- **Row 7 (0-based)**: Columns 3–5 are empty, so the block’s bottom row (Row 1, columns 3–5) fits.  \n\nThis placement is valid, does not exceed the top boundary, and avoids overlapping existing blocks.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block. The goal is to place the block such that it clears a row (if possible), maximizing the score.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 rows (top to bottom) and 10 columns. Key observations about filled columns (from top to bottom):\n- Columns 1 and 4 have filled cells starting at row 7.\n- Columns 2 and 3 have filled cells starting at row 9.\n- Columns 5 and 6 have filled cells starting at row 8.\n- Columns 7–10 have filled cells only at row 10.\n\n### Block Options:\nThe current block is a straight line, which can be horizontal (0° or 180°, shape `****`) or vertical (90° or 270°, shape `*` stacked 4 times). We focus on horizontal placement to potentially clear a row.\n\n### Horizontal Placement (0° or 180°):\nA horizontal block (`****`) covers 4 consecutive columns. The landing row is determined by the highest filled cell in those columns. For the block to clear a row, it must fill the remaining empty columns in a nearly full row.\n\n### Optimal Move:\n- **Target Row 9**: Row 9 is currently `******....` (columns 1–6 filled, columns 7–10 empty). Placing a horizontal block in columns 7–10 of row 9 will fill all 10 columns, clearing the row and increasing the score by 1.\n- **Landing Calculation**: For columns 7–10, the first filled cell (from the top) is row 10. The landing row is `10 - 1 = 9`, ensuring the block lands in row 9.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the horizontal block (0° rotation) at drop coordinate 7 (leftmost column 7) fills row 9 completely, clearing it.\n\nAnswer: 7 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current board state and the falling block's rotations to find a position that maximizes row clearing potential. \n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has existing blocks in rows 7, 8, and 9 (0-based). Key observations:\n- Row 9 (bottom row) has 8 filled squares (columns 0, 3-9), with columns 1 and 2 empty.\n- Clearing a row requires filling all 10 columns in a row.\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe falling block has four rotations. We focus on the 90° rotation, which has a 2-column width and 3-row height. Its shape is:\n```\n*0\n*0\n**\n```\nThis rotation has squares at (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), and (2,1) (0-based block coordinates).\n\n### Optimal Placement:\nPlacing the 90° rotation at drop coordinate 2 (1-based) aligns its columns with the empty columns 1 and 2 (0-based) in row 9. This allows the block to fall to the bottom of the board, filling these empty columns in row 9. \n\n- **Drop Coordinate 2 (1-based):** Aligns the block's leftmost column with column 2 (1-based), covering columns 2 and 3 (1-based) or columns 1 and 2 (0-based).\n- **Rotation 90°:** The block’s bottom row (row 2 of the block) will land in row 9 (0-based), filling columns 1 and 2 (0-based) in row 9.\n\n### Outcome:\nAfter placement, row 9 (0-based) becomes fully filled (all 10 columns), triggering a row clear and increasing the score by 1.\n\nAnswer: 2 90","\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's possible rotations and positions. The goal is to place the block as low as possible while avoiding collisions with existing blocks.\n\n### Board Analysis\nThe board has 10 columns (1-10) and 10 rows (0-9, top to bottom). The bottom two rows (rows 8 and 9) have partial blocks:\n- Row 8: `**.*......` (columns 1-2 and 4 are filled).\n- Row 9: `**.***....` (columns 1-2 and 4-6 are filled).\n\n### Block Rotations\nThe current block has two unique rotations:\n- **0°\/180°**: 3 columns wide, 2 rows tall, with occupied cells at (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1) (relative to the block's top-left corner).\n- **90°\/270°**: 2 columns wide, 3 rows tall, with occupied cells at (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1) (relative to the block's top-left corner).\n\n### Key Observations\n- **0°\/180° rotation** (3 columns wide) cannot land lower than row 7 due to existing blocks in column 4 (rows 8-9).\n- **90°\/270° rotation** (2 columns wide) can land lower because it is narrower and taller, potentially reaching row 9 (the bottom row) if placed in columns with no existing blocks.\n\n### Optimal Placement\nFor the **90° rotation** (2 columns wide), placing the block in columns 6-7 (leftmost column 6) allows it to land at row 9 (the bottom row). This position avoids collisions with existing blocks:\n- The block’s cells are (7,6), (8,6), (8,7), (9,7) (rows 7-9, columns 6-7), all of which are empty on the current board.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe best action is to place the 90°-rotated block with its leftmost column at 6.\n\nAnswer: 6 90","\nTo determine the optimal action for placing the current 2x2 block, we analyze the game board and the block's possible positions. The block is a square (2x2) with identical rotations, so rotation angle does not affect its shape. The goal is to place the block as low as possible to minimize gaps and prepare for future line clears.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 columns (1-10) and 10 rows (top to bottom, rows 0-9). Key observations:\n- Rows 0-6 are mostly empty.\n- Row 7 (0-based) has a single '*' in column 5 (1-based 6).\n- Row 8 (0-based) has '*' in columns 1-2, 4, 6-7 (1-based 1-2, 4, 6-7).\n- Row 9 (0-based) has '*' in columns 1-2, 4-7 (1-based 1-2, 4-7).\n\n### Block Placement:\nThe block covers 2 consecutive columns. We need to find the leftmost column (1-9) where the block can fall to the lowest possible row without overlapping existing blocks. Columns 8-9 (1-based) are empty in rows 7-9, allowing the block to fall to the bottom (rows 8-9, 0-based).\n\n### Optimal Position:\nPlacing the block with leftmost coordinate 8 (1-based) in columns 8-9 (1-based) allows it to land at the bottom (rows 8-9, 0-based), filling empty space without creating gaps. Any rotation is equivalent for this square block, so rotation angle 0° is chosen.\n\nAnswer: 8 0","\nTo solve this Tetris problem, we need to determine a valid placement for the current block such that it lands without exceeding the top boundary of the board and does not overlap with existing blocks. The goal is to identify a rotation and drop coordinate that allows the block to settle correctly.\n\n### Analysis of the Game Board and Block:\n- **Board State**: The board has 10 rows and 10 columns. The bottom rows (rows 8-10) have some occupied squares (`*`), with row 8 having a single `*` in column 6, row 9 having `*` in columns 1, 2, 4, 6-9, and row 10 having `*` in columns 1, 2, 4-9.\n- **Current Block**: The block has four rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°). We focus on the 0° rotation, which is 3 columns wide (shape: top row `*00`, bottom row `***`).\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The 0° rotation spans 3 columns (width 3) and 2 rows (height 2). It can be placed in columns 1-8 (since 3 columns require the leftmost coordinate `x` to satisfy `x + 2 ≤ 10`).\n- For a valid placement, the block must land on existing blocks or the bottom of the board without overlapping. We need to check where the block can settle without exceeding the top boundary.\n\n### Valid Placement:\n- Consider placing the 0° rotation at `x = 5` (leftmost column 5). This positions the block in columns 5, 6, 7. The block’s bottom row (`***` in columns 5-7) will fall until it hits an obstacle. \n- Row 8 has a single `*` in column 6, so the block’s bottom row (columns 5-7) will settle in row 7 (above row 8). The top row of the block (`*00` in column 5) will be in row 6.\n\n### Verification:\n- **Row 6 (top of the block)**: Column 5 will have a `*` (no overlap, as row 6 is empty).\n- **Row 7 (bottom of the block)**: Columns 5-7 will have `***` (no overlap, as row 7 is empty).\n- This placement is valid and does not cause the block to exceed the top boundary.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's possible rotations. The goal is to place the block to minimize stack height and avoid game over while considering potential row clears.\n\n### Game Board Analysis\nThe board has 10 columns and 10 rows (top to bottom: rows 1–10). Existing blocks are concentrated in rows 6–10:\n- Row 6: `....*.....` (column 5 filled)\n- Row 7: `....***...` (columns 5–7 filled)\n- Row 8: `.....*....` (column 6 filled)\n- Row 9: `**.*.****.` (columns 1–2, 4, 6–9 filled)\n- Row 10: `**.******.` (columns 1–2, 4–8 filled)\n\n### Current Block\nThe block is a straight line with two distinct rotations:\n- **0°\/180°**: Horizontal (4 squares in a row, width 4, height 1).\n- **90°\/270°**: Vertical (4 squares stacked, width 1, height 4).\n\n### Key Observations\n- **Horizontal Block (0°\/180°)**: Requires 4 consecutive columns. Placing it in lower rows (e.g., rows 9–10) would fill gaps but not clear rows (no row has 10 filled squares yet).\n- **Vertical Block (90°\/270°)**: Requires 1 column and 4 consecutive rows. Placing it in an empty column (e.g., column 3) minimizes stack height by filling lower rows (rows 7–10) where existing blocks are already present.\n\n### Optimal Action\nPlacing the vertical block (90° rotation) in column 3 (leftmost coordinate 3) is ideal. Column 3 is entirely empty, so the block will fall to the bottom (rows 7–10) without overlapping existing blocks. This keeps the stack low and avoids raising the highest block position.\n\nAnswer: 3 90","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands without exceeding the top boundary and fills gaps effectively.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 rows (top to bottom: rows 1-10). Key observations:\n- Rows 1-5 are mostly empty.\n- Row 6: `....*.....` (column 5 filled).\n- Row 7: `..*.***...` (columns 3, 5-7 filled).\n- Row 8: `****.****.` (columns 1-4, 6-9 filled).\n- Row 9: `*********.` (columns 1-9 filled, column 10 empty).\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe block has four rotations:\n- **0°**: Top row: `0*0` (column 2 filled), bottom row: `***` (columns 1-3 filled).\n- **90°**: Columns 1-2 filled across three rows: `*0`, `**`, `*0`.\n- **180°**: Top row: `***` (columns 1-3 filled), bottom row: `0*0` (column 2 filled).\n- **270°**: Columns 1-2 filled across three rows: `0*`, `**`, `0*`.\n\n### Strategy:\nThe 180° rotation (top row: `***`, bottom row: `0*0`) is chosen because it can fill a horizontal gap in the middle columns (5-7) without overlapping existing blocks. Placing it at `x=5` (leftmost column 5) aligns the block to land in rows 4 and 5, filling columns 5-7 in row 4 and column 6 in row 5. This placement avoids obstacles and integrates with the existing structure.\n\n### Validation:\n- **180° rotation at x=5**: The block spans columns 5-7. The top row (row 4) of the block will occupy columns 5-7 (all empty in row 4), and the bottom row (row 5) will occupy column 6 (empty in row 5). The block lands here as the next row (row 6) has filled cells in columns 5-7, preventing further descent.\n\nAnswer: 5 180","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands without exceeding the top boundary and ideally fills rows to clear lines.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 columns (0-9) and 10 rows (0-9, top to bottom). Key observations:\n- Rows 0-3 are empty.\n- Row 4: `....***...` (columns 4-6 filled).\n- Row 5: `....**....` (columns 4-5 filled).\n- Row 6: `..*.***...` (column 2, columns 4-6 filled).\n- Row 7: `..*..*....` (column 2, column 5 filled).\n- Row 8: `****.****.` (columns 0-3, 5-8 filled; columns 4 and 9 empty).\n- Row 9: `*********.` (columns 0-8 filled; column 9 empty).\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe block has four rotations. We focus on **0° rotation** (shape: `*00`\/`***`), which occupies 3 columns (width 3) and 2 rows (height 2). The cells are:  \n- (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) (relative to the block's top-left corner).\n\n### Drop Coordinate and Rotation Selection:\nFor 0° rotation, the block’s leftmost column (1-based) ranges from 1 to 8 (0-based 0-7). We need to find a position where the block lands as low as possible without overlapping filled cells.\n\n#### Target Position:\n- **Drop Coordinate (1-based): 4** (0-based column 3). This places the block in columns 3, 4, 5.  \n- **Rotation: 0°** (no rotation).  \n\n### Landing Check:\nThe block’s cells at this position are:  \n- (R, 3), (R+1, 3), (R+1, 4), (R+1, 5).  \n\nWe check rows from the bottom up. The first filled cells in columns 4-5 are in row 4 (from `....***...`). Thus, the block lands when its bottom row (R+1) is just above row 4. This occurs at **R=2** (top row of the block), with the bottom row at R+1=3.  \n\n### Outcome:\nPlacing the block at drop coordinate 4 (1-based) with 0° rotation fills columns 3, 4, 5 in rows 2 and 3. This does not clear any lines but safely stacks the block without creating new holes or exceeding the top boundary.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block as low as possible, considering existing filled cells and potential row clears.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 rows (0 to 9, top to bottom) and 10 columns (0 to 9, left to right). Key observations:\n- Row 9 (bottom row) is nearly full (columns 0-8 filled, column 9 empty).\n- Row 8 has a gap at column 4 (empty).\n- Lower rows (rows 6-8) have scattered filled cells, with columns 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8-9 having filled cells in rows 6-9.\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe current block has four rotations. We focus on the 180° rotation, which has the shape:\n```\n***\n*00\n```\nThis rotation spans 3 columns (width 3) and 2 rows (height 2). The cells are:\n- Top row: columns 0-2 (relative to the block's leftmost column).\n- Bottom row: column 0 (relative to the block's leftmost column).\n\n### Placement Strategy:\nWe aim to place the block as low as possible. For the 180° rotation, placing the leftmost column at 1 (1-based, 0-based column 0) allows the block to land in lower rows without overlapping existing filled cells. \n\n#### Key Checks for 180° Rotation at Column 1 (1-based):\n- **Top row cells (columns 0-2, row r):** These columns (0-2) have no filled cells in rows 0-5. The highest filled cell in column 2 is row 6 (from row 6: `..*.***...`). Thus, the top row can safely land in row 5.\n- **Bottom row cell (column 0, row r+1):** Column 0 has no filled cells in rows 0-6. The highest filled cell in column 0 is row 8 (from row 8: `****.****.`). Thus, the bottom row can safely land in row 6.\n\n### Validation:\nPlacing the 180° rotation at column 1 (1-based) with the top row at row 5 and bottom row at row 6 avoids overlapping existing filled cells. The block will land at these rows, as moving further down would overlap with filled cells in row 6 (column 2).\n\nAnswer: 1 180","\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it clears a row (maximizing the score) while avoiding game over.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The board has 10 columns. The bottom row (row 10) is \"*********.\" (columns 1-9 filled, column 10 empty). Clearing row 10 would increase the score.\n- The current block in 270° rotation has a shape that can fill column 10 of row 10, completing the row.\n\n### Analysis of 270° Rotation:\nThe 270° rotation of the block has the shape:\n```\n**\n0*\n0*\n```\nThis block spans 2 columns (width) and 3 rows (height). When placed at column 9 (leftmost column), it occupies columns 9 and 10. The cells of the block are:\n- (9, current_row) (column 9, row current_row)\n- (10, current_row) (column 10, row current_row)\n- (10, current_row+1) (column 10, row current_row+1)\n- (10, current_row+2) (column 10, row current_row+2)\n\n### Landing Position:\n- Column 9 has its highest filled row at row 9 (HFR=9), so the block’s cell in column 9 must land above row 9.\n- Column 10 is empty (HFR=11), so the block can fall to row 10.\n\nThe block lands at `current_row=8` (the highest row where all cells fit without overlapping existing blocks):\n- (9,8): column 9, row 8 (empty).\n- (10,8): column 10, row 8 (empty).\n- (10,9): column 10, row 9 (empty).\n- (10,10): column 10, row 10 (empty).\n\n### Result:\nPlacing the block at column 9 with 270° rotation fills column 10 of row 10, completing the row. This clears row 10, increasing the score by 1.\n\nAnswer: 9 270","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board, the falling block's rotations, and potential landing positions. The goal is to place the block such that it lands without exceeding the top boundary and ideally contributes to clearing rows (though no full rows are immediately clearable here).\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Board State**: The bottom rows (rows 6–9) have significant occupancy, with row 9 missing only column 4 (0-based) to be full. Other rows have gaps, so clearing a row immediately is unlikely.\n- **Block Rotations**: The block has four rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°). We focus on 0° and 180° rotations, as they are wider (3 columns) and better suited for filling gaps in the lower rows.\n\n### Analysis of 0° Rotation:\nThe 0° rotation has a shape:\n```\n*00\n***\n```\nThis block is 3 columns wide and 2 rows tall. For a drop coordinate \\( x \\) (1-based), the block covers columns \\( x-1, x, x+1 \\) (0-based) and rows \\( y \\) (top) and \\( y+1 \\) (bottom).\n\n### Optimal Placement for 0° Rotation:\nWe target \\( x = 5 \\) (1-based, 0-based \\( x_0 = 4 \\)), covering columns 4, 5, 6. The highest occupied cells in these columns are:\n- Column 4: Row 3 (0-based)\n- Column 5: Row 4 (0-based)\n- Column 6: Row 4 (0-based)\n\nThe block lands when its bottom row (row \\( y+1 \\)) is just above these occupied cells. The maximum \\( y+1 \\) is 3 (0-based), so \\( y = 2 \\). This places the block at rows 2 and 3 (0-based), filling columns 4 (row 2), 4 (row 3), 5 (row 3), and 6 (row 3) without overlapping existing blocks.\n\n### Conclusion:\nPlacing the 0° rotation at \\( x = 5 \\) (1-based) ensures the block lands stably in the lower rows, avoiding holes and preparing for future row clears.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal action, we analyze the current game board and the falling block's rotations to find a valid placement that avoids exceeding the top boundary and maximizes potential line clears.\n\n### Game Board Analysis\nThe board has 10 columns (1-10) and 10 rows (top row 0 to bottom row 9). Key observations about filled rows:\n- Row 9: `****.*****` (columns 0-3 and 5-9 filled; column 4 empty).\n- Row 8: `..*..*..**` (columns 2, 5, 8-9 filled).\n- Rows 7-2: Partially filled with gaps.\n- Rows 0-1: Completely empty.\n\n### Current Block Rotations\nThe block has four rotations:\n- **0°**: 3 columns wide, 2 rows tall. Shape:  \n  Row 0: `*00` (column 0 filled)  \n  Row 1: `***` (columns 0-2 filled)  \n- **90°**: 2 columns wide, 3 rows tall. Shape:  \n  Row 0: `**` (columns 0-1 filled)  \n  Row 1: `*0` (column 0 filled)  \n  Row 2: `*0` (column 0 filled)  \n- **180°**: 3 columns wide, 2 rows tall. Shape:  \n  Row 0: `***` (columns 0-2 filled)  \n  Row 1: `00*` (column 2 filled)  \n- **270°**: 2 columns wide, 3 rows tall. Shape:  \n  Row 0: `0*` (column 1 filled)  \n  Row 1: `0*` (column 1 filled)  \n  Row 2: `**` (columns 0-1 filled)  \n\n\n### Evaluation of Rotations and Drop Coordinates\n#### 0° Rotation (3 columns wide)\nThe block spans columns \\( x, x+1, x+2 \\) and has cells:  \n- Row 0: \\( (x, y) \\) (filled)  \n- Row 1: \\( (x, y+1), (x+1, y+1), (x+2, y+1) \\) (all filled).  \n\n**Target: x=5** (columns 5-7).  \n- Check landing position: The block falls until it collides with existing blocks or the bottom.  \n- At \\( y=2 \\), the cells are \\( (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3) \\).  \n  - \\( (5,2) \\): Row 2, column 5 is empty (`.`).  \n  - \\( (5,3) \\): Row 3, column 5 is filled (`*`) → collision.  \n- Adjust to \\( y=1 \\): Cells \\( (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (7,2) \\).  \n  - All cells in rows 1-2, columns 5-7 are empty (`.`).  \n  - The block lands here without collision.  \n\n\n### Conclusion\nThe 0° rotation placed at column 5 (leftmost column 5) with rotation 0° is valid, as it lands without exceeding the top boundary and fits into the board.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","\n\n\nTo determine the optimal move, we analyze the current Tetris board and the falling block's rotations. The goal is to place the block such that it lands without exceeding the top boundary and ideally clears rows to increase the score.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has 10 columns (1-10) and 10 rows (top to bottom). Key observations:\n- Row 9 (bottom row) has 9 filled cells (only column 4 is empty).\n- Other rows have fewer filled cells, so row 9 is the primary target for clearing.\n\n### Block Analysis:\nThe current block has two unique rotations:\n- **0°\/180°**: 2 rows high, 3 columns wide, with squares at (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2).\n- **90°\/270°**: 3 rows high, 2 columns wide, with squares at (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0).\n\n### Strategy:\nTo clear row 9, we need to fill its empty cell (column 4). The 90° rotation (3 rows high, 2 columns wide) can fit into column 4 and 5, potentially filling row 9's empty cell.\n\n### Placement Check:\nFor **90° rotation** with leftmost column 4 (1-based, column 3 in 0-based):\n- Columns covered: 3 and 4 (0-based).\n- Squares occupied: (r,4), (r+1,3), (r+1,4), (r+2,3).\n- The block falls until it collides with existing blocks or the bottom. Testing lower rows shows the block lands at row 7 (0-based), filling row 9's column 4 and clearing the row.\n\n### Validation:\nThis placement avoids exceeding the top boundary and clears row 9, increasing the score.\n\nAnswer: 4 90"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
