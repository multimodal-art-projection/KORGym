We can choose a simple placement that guarantees the block will fall all the way to the bottom without any issues.\n\nWe note that with the current block’s different rotations the 0° rotation gives a shape that spans 3 columns and 2 rows. When dropped with its leftmost square at column 1, the block’s occupied squares will be in columns 1 (in the top row) and columns 1, 2, 3 (in the row below). Since the board is empty, this placement is valid and straightforward.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","I'll use rotation 0° for the current block. In this rotation the block’s 2×3 grid looks like:\n\n Row1: 0**\n Row2: **0\n\nThis means the block’s filled squares are at positions (row, column) relative to its top‐left:\n (0,1), (0,2), (1,0) and (1,1).\n\nIf we choose drop_coordinate = 4 then the block covers board columns 4–6.

No complete lines are made, so the score remains 0.\n\nHence the action is:\n\nAnswer: 4 0","I'll choose to place the 2×2 square so that it falls as far as possible (i.e. into the bottom two rows) without colliding with any existing blocks. Notice that row 10 already has blocks in columns 1–5, so if we try to let the block fall into row 10 it must land entirely in columns 6–10. However, row 9 already has a '*' in column 6 so the 2×2 piece cannot land in columns 6–7 (since that would require placing a block at row 9, column 6). Checking the possibilities, if we drop the piece with its leftmost column at 7 (covering columns 7 and 8) then:\n\n• On row 9, columns 7 and 8 are empty.\n• On row 10, columns 7 and 8 are also empty.\n\nThus the block will fall until its top reaches row 9 and its bottom row is row 10, which is the lowest possible landing without collision.  \nSince the 2×2 block is invariant under 0°, 90°, 180°, or 270° rotations (the shape is the same in all rotations), I choose the 0° rotation.  \n\nAnswer: 7 0","I'll choose to drop the block using the 0° rotation. In this rotation the block’s pattern is:\n\n  Row 1:   \"00*\"   (only the third column in the block is filled)\n  Row 2:  \"***\"   (all three columns are filled)\n\nWhen you choose the drop coordinate, you’re specifying where the leftmost column of the block’s bounding box lands (columns 1 through 10). For a block in 0° with width 3 the valid drop coordinate ranges from 1 up to 8.\n\nFor example, if we choose the drop coordinate 4 then the block cells are aligned as follows:\n • Its top row cell (“*” from \"00*\") appears in column 6 (that is, 4 + 2).\n • Its bottom row cells (“***”) appear in columns 4, 5, and 6.\n\nNow, when dropped the block falls until any further down movement would cause a collision. Given the board, rows 1–8 are empty so the block can drop until its bottom row is immediately above the filled cells in row 9. Testing the drop:\n – If the block’s top row starts at board row 7, the bottom row will be row 8. In row 8 all squares are free.\n – Trying to drop one step further (top row row 8, bottom row row 9) would cause a collision because in row 9 the board already has block squares (in particular, row 9 columns 5 and 6 are occupied).\nThus the block comes to rest with its top row at row 7 and its bottom row at row 8.\n\nThis is a valid move. Therefore, the chosen move is to drop the block at coordinate 4 using the 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","I analyzed the board and the falling piece (a 2×2 square that looks the same under any rotation). One simple safe move is to drop the block so its leftmost square is in column 1 and not rotated (0°). In this placement the square will fall until its bottom cells rest just above the already‐placed blocks in column 1 (the board has blocks in row 9 and 10 in that column). In doing so the 2×2 block will settle in rows 7–8, which is legal and does not trigger an unwanted game end.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","Based on the board layout and the falling‐block rules, one safe and valid strategy is to use the 0° rotation and drop the block so its “leftmost” column is 4.

This placement avoids a collision on landing and does not exceed any boundaries.\n\nThus, the recommended action is:\n\nAnswer: 4 0","After reviewing the board and the falling block (which can be rotated into four orientations), I looked for a safe placement that “drops” as far as possible. One promising option is to use the 270° rotation. In that orientation the block’s shape is (when arranged in a 3‐row by 2‐column grid):\n\n Row1: **  \n Row2: 0*  \n Row3: 0*  \n\nThat means the occupied squares (relative to the block’s top‐left corner) are at positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,1) and (2,1). Choosing a drop coordinate tells us where the leftmost column of this 2‑column shape lands. If we set drop coordinate = 9 then the block covers columns 9 and 10. Simulating the “drop” (letting the block fall as far as possible without colliding) it turns out that the block can descend until its top‐left corner is at row 8. (Trying to go one row lower would push the block partially off the board.) At this landing the block’s squares will fall on:\n – Row8, columns 9 and 10  \n – Row9, column 10  \n – Row10, column 10\n\nA check against the board reveals that these positions are empty. Also note that using the 270° rotation with drop coordinate = 9 lets the piece settle at the lowest possible position—and so it does not trigger a premature game end. \n\nThus, the move I choose is:\n\nAnswer: 9 270","I'll choose to use the 0° rotation of the current block and drop it so that its left‐most square is in column 2. In 0° the block’s grid is\n\n  Row1: [*, *, 0]  \n  Row2: [0, *, *]\n\nso when placed with its left edge at column 2 the filled cells will lie at:\n  • Top row: board columns 2 and 3  \n  • Bottom row: board columns 3 and 4\n\nAfter “dropping” (letting gravity work until a collision) the piece will come to rest high enough that no occupied board square is overwritten yet far enough that it “locks” into place (for instance, its drop is stopped by the star already in row7, column? in one of the involved columns). A brief simulation shows that with drop coordinate 2 the block falls until its top row lands in row6 and its bottom row in row7. (For example, if we try a lower placement the filled cell in row7 at column 2 would overlap an already‐occupied square.) This is a legal move and does not immediately cause a full row to be cleared, but it is safe.\n\nSo my final action is to drop at column 2 with a 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 2 0","After analyzing the board and the falling block (which can be rotated in four ways), one acceptable valid move is to use the 270° rotation and drop the block so its leftmost square is in column 7. In this rotation the block’s shape is\n\n  Row0: 0*   (i.e. a square in the second column)\n  Row1: **   (two squares spanning its two columns)\n  Row2: 0*   (again a square in the second column)\n\nWhen positioned with its leftmost column at 7, the block will fall until it comes to rest without overlapping any existing “*” on the board. A simulation shows that if the block lands with its top row in row 6 (so that its rows cover board rows 6, 7, and 8) then none of its occupied squares hit a preexisting block. (For example, the block cell from row–2 lands at board row 8, column 8; row1 cells land at board row 7, columns 7 and 8; and row0’s square lands at row 6, column 8 – all falling into empty positions.) \n\nThus one valid answer is to drop the block at coordinate 7 with a 270° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 7 270","After analyzing the board and the four available rotations of the current block, I’ve decided to use the unrotated (0°) configuration. In this rotation the piece is 2 rows tall and 3 columns wide (with only the left column occupied on the top row and all three squares occupied on the bottom row). Dropping it so that its leftmost square lands in column 3 should allow it to settle into the gaps without causing an early top‐boundary collision and keeps our options open for future line clears.\n\nAnswer: 3 0","I'll choose to drop the block so that its left‐most square lands in column 4 with no rotation. This means using the 0° configuration, where the block’s shape is\n\n  Row1: 0 * 0  \n  Row2: * * *\n\nand its left‐most column (column 4) will cover columns 4–6 on the board. With this placement the block should settle into a gap without immediately triggering an overflow and with potential for future row clears.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","Based on the current board layout and the fact that the T‐shaped block can be dropped safely into a “gap” in the middle of the board without risking an early game over, a good move is to use the block in its unrotated (0°) form and drop it so that the leftmost square lands in column 4.

With an empty board there are no obstacles and gravity will take the block to the bottom.\n\nChoosing a drop coordinate of 4 means that the leftmost (top‐left) square of the block will be placed in column 4.

In rotation 0° the block is shaped as a 2‑row by 3‑column piece where only the leftmost cell of the top row is filled and all three cells of the bottom row are filled. If we drop this piece with its leftmost column at column 4, its final resting position will have the top block at row 7, column 4 and the bottom row covering columns 4–6 on row 8. This placement avoids any collisions (the board already has blocks in row 9 and row 10 that would otherwise cause a collision if we dropped lower) and it lands cleanly. Therefore, my solution is to use the 0° rotation and drop the block with its leftmost square in column 4.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","Based on the board layout and the current falling block (which—in its 0° or 180° rotation—spans three columns, with its filled cells arranged as:\n\n  Row1: [blank, filled, filled]\n  Row2: [filled, filled, blank]\n\nplacing it in a region of the board that is completely empty will let it drop to the bottom without interference. The left three columns (columns 1, 2, and 3) are free from any occupied squares even in the lower rows, so by choosing a drop coordinate of 1 with a 0° rotation the block will descend unobstructed to the bottom. This avoids any accidental collisions with the existing blocks that are clustered around column 4 and to the right, thus preserving the current state and leaving open choices for future placements.\n\nTherefore, my solution is to drop the block at coordinate 1 using no rotation change (0°).\n\nAnswer: 1 0","Based on the board layout and using “skilled‐play” reasoning, one valid drop is to use the block in its 0° rotation so that its “L” shape lands low enough without colliding into already occupied squares. In this rotation the piece looks like\n\n  X 0 0  \n  X X X\n\nwith the only block in the top row at the left. When we choose a drop coordinate of 3 the piece’s columns map as follows:\n • Column 3 (piece’s column 0) has its lowest square at the piece’s second row. On the board the first filled square in column 3 is in row 9 so the block will land so that its bottom sits in row 8, and nothing collides.  \n • In column 4 (piece’s column 1) the board already has a block in row 7, so using the same reasoning the piece will stop one row earlier.  \n • Column 5 leads to a similar result, with the collision occurring a bit later, but the overall piece must stop as soon as any part collides.\n\nThe minimum landing row determined by these column‐by‐column “drop tests” is row 5 for the top of the 2‐row piece; that is, the piece lands safely without “overflowing” the board or causing an immediate loss. (Other rotations and drop points may be viable too—but this move both avoids trouble and keeps a good position.)\n\nThus a valid and safe action is to drop the block with its 0° rotation at column 3.\n\nAnswer: 3 0","I analyzed the board and the four block rotations. For example, using the 0° rotation the block’s pattern is\n\n  Row 1: 0 0 *\n  Row 2: * * *\n\nso when placed with its leftmost square at board column 7 the three “bottom‐row” blocks will fill columns 7, 8, and 9 (in 1–indexed notation) on the row where it lands. Running the gravity simulation shows that the block will drop as far as possible (landing with its top row on board row 8 and its bottom row on row 9) without colliding with an already occupied cell. In this placement all block “squares” fall into empty spaces, and no immediate game–ending collision occurs.\n\nThus one acceptable legal move is to drop the block rotated at 0° with its leftmost column at coordinate 7.\n\nAnswer: 7 0","I'll choose to drop the block with its 0° rotation so that the block’s bounding box is placed with its leftmost column at column 4. In the 0° orientation the block occupies 2 rows and 3 columns with the pattern:\n Row 1: [*][*][0]\n Row 2: [0][*][*]\n\nThat means its filled cells (relative to the block’s top‐left corner) lie at offsets (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), and (1,2).\n\nI simulated the drop as follows when using drop coordinate 4:\n• The board columns 4–6 will be the span of the block’s bounding box.\n• The block falls one row at a time. When its top‐left corner is at row 1, then at row 2, row 3, and row 4 no collision occurs. However, when attempting to place it one more row down (i.e. top row = 5) one of the block’s cells would end up at row 6, column 5 where the board already has a block (since row 6 “..***.....” has stars at columns 3,4,5). Therefore the block locks in when its top row is row 4.\n\nIn that placement the block’s cells will end up at:\n • Row 4, columns 4 and 5 (from block offsets (0,0) and (0,1))\n • Row 5, columns 5 and 6 (from block offsets (1,1) and (1,2))\nThis is a valid placement according to the rules.\n\nThus, the final action is:\n\nAnswer: 4 0","I'll choose to keep the block in its 0° rotation and drop it so that its leftmost occupied square lands in column 7.

Based on the board’s configuration the block will fall until its top row reaches row 8 (its next downward move would produce a collision with an occupied cell in row 9).

Simulating the drop:\n• At first, placing the block high (say, with its top row at row 1) yields no collision.\n• When it drops step‐by‐step, it can fall until the next downward move would land its bottom row on row 4, where row 4 already has “*” at columns 4 and 5.\n• Thus the block safely lands when its top row is at row 2 (and its bottom row at row 3) – avoiding any collision. \n\nThis move is valid and causes no immediate row clear but is a safe placement.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","Based on my analysis, the best move is to use the 90° rotation and drop the leftmost square of the block in column 7.

With drop coordinate 7 the piece’s cells (when mapped onto the board) will be at:\n  • Row t  : column 7+1 = 8\n  • Row t+1 : columns 7 and 7+1 = 8\n  • Row t+2 : column 7  \nA step‐by‐step “fall” simulation shows that when dropping at column 7 with a 90° rotation the block falls as far as possible (landing so that its bottom cell is on row 8) before a collision prevents further descent. (Other placements leave the block higher on the board, which is less favourable.) \n\nThus, the recommended action is:\n\nAnswer: 7 90","I'll choose to drop the block using the 90° rotation and aligning its left edge with column 2.\n\nHere’s a brief explanation for that decision:\n\n1. In the 90° rotation, the block’s filled cells are located at positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (2,0) (with the top‐left of the block taken as the reference). This shape spans 2 columns and 3 rows.\n2. When we drop the block with its left edge at column 2 (i.e. drop coordinate 2), we consider each column:\n  • For the left column (column 2 in the board), the block’s bottom cell in that column is at offset 2. The first occupied cell in board column 2 appears in row 9. That gives room for the block (landing row = 9 − 2 = 7 for that column).\n  • For the right column (column 3), the block only has a filled cell in its top row (offset 0). The first filled cell in board column 3 appears earlier (row 5), so the landing row there would be 5 − 1 = 4.\n3. The block will drop as far as the most restrictive column allows – in this case, row 4 becomes the top row of the block.\n4. With the block positioned with its top‐left at (row 4, column 2), its filled squares fall into positions:\n  – (row 4, column 2) and (row 4, column 3) from its first row,\n  – (row 5, column 2) from its second row, and\n  – (row 6, column 2) from its third row.\n5. A check shows these board cells are empty, so the placement is legal and avoids collision.\n\nThus, the action is:\n\nAnswer: 2 90","I'll choose to use the 90° rotation and drop the block so that its bounding box’s left side is in column 2. In this rotation the block’s shape \n  Row1: 0*\n  Row2: **\n  Row3: *0  \nhas filled squares at relative positions (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) and (2,0). Dropping it at column 2 means these cells will fall to board positions (r, 3), (r+1, 2), (r+1, 3) and (r+2, 2). A simulation of the falling shows that the block will “land” safely with its top row reaching row 1 (making its cells appear in rows 1–3) without any collision and without extending above the top border. (A further drop by one row would cause the cell going to row 4 to hit an already occupied square so the piece stops with its top row at row 1.) \n\nThus my move is:\n\nAnswer: 2 90","Here’s how I reasoned through the problem:\n\n1. The current block is available in four rotations. For the 0° rotation it has a “L‐like” layout in two rows – a single block on the top row and three contiguous blocks on the bottom row. When dropped with leftmost coordinate X on the board, it will cover columns X, X+1, and X+2 (for its occupied squares).\n\n2. I examined the board’s lower rows for gaps. In particular, row 10 (“**.******.”) is nearly full (only missing column 3 and column 10). Although a proper “line clearance” is hard to guarantee immediately, a drop into one of the “empty” regions may eventually help fill in gaps. \n\n3. Aiming for one plausible valid move that avoids the block “exceeding the top” and fits entirely (since a 0° block needs three columns and valid drop positions run from 1 to 8), I looked at the area on the far right. By selecting drop coordinate 8 for the 0° rotation the block’s bottom row will be placed in columns 8–10. These columns are playable since they lie fully within the board’s boundaries and the falling piece is likely to settle into a gap (for instance eventually “landing” just above existing blocks in row 6 where column 8 already has an occupied square).\n\n4. While thorough simulation of every row is complex manually, this move is both valid and avoids any immediate over-the-top placement.\n\nThus, my chosen action is to drop the block with its leftmost square in column 8 and leave it unrotated (0°).\n\nAnswer: 8 0","I suggest using the 90° rotated block and “dropping” it so that its leftmost column aligns with column 1. In that rotation the filled cells are arranged (relative to the block’s top‐left) as follows:\n Row0: [0, *]\n Row1: [*, *]\n Row2: [*, 0]\n\nThis means that if you choose drop_coordinate 1 the cells will eventually fall into board positions:\n (Y, 2)\n (Y+1, 1) and (Y+1, 2)\n (Y+2, 1)\nA simulation of the “falling” shows that when the piece drops from high above, it can descend until the block “lands” (i.e. the next step down would make one filled cell collide with an occupied board cell). One finds that for drop_coordinate 1 the piece will come to rest with its bounding box’s top row at row 7 (so that the filled cells end up in row 7–9) without overlapping any already placed blocks. (For example, the filled cell that would be at row9, column2 for the problematic Y=8 is avoided because the falling piece stops one row higher.)\n\nThus, the recommended action is to rotate the current block by 90° and drop it with its leftmost column at column 1.\n\nAnswer: 1 90"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

In this configuration the block will fall unobstructed until it lands with its top row on row 8 and its bottom row on row 9.

In the 0° orientation the piece has a “stem‐at‐top” plus a full row below (its cells are “*00” on the top row and “***” on the bottom row). When dropped into the center‐right area—here, by aligning the leftmost square (of the block) with column 5 (remembering that the drop coordinate is 1–indexed, so “5” means that the block’s left cell lands in column 5)—the falling piece will settle safely on top of the lower blocks without causing any immediate collisions. Although no full row is cleared in this move, it creates a relatively level surface for subsequent rounds.\n\nThus, taking all factors into account, the chosen move is to drop the block at coordinate 5 in its original (0°) rotation.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","I'll use the 0° orientation for this move. In the 0° rotation the block looks like:\n\n  Row1: 0 * 0      (only the middle cell is filled)\n  Row2: * * *      (all three cells are filled)\n\nIf we choose a drop coordinate of 3, the block’s three columns will align with board columns 3, 4, and 5. In that configuration the filled cells (after rotation) will land as follows when the block “drops”:\n • Top row of the block: it will fill board row 5 at column 4.\n • Bottom row of the block: it will fill board row 6 at columns 3, 4, and 5.\n\nTo explain the descent briefly:\n• The block can fall safely while its top is in rows 1–5.\n• A drop from row 5 (so that the block occupies rows 5 and 6) is safe because row 5 is empty and row 6 is also empty.\n• If the block were to fall one more row (so that it covers rows 6 and 7) then the filled cell in its bottom row at column 5 would hit the already placed block at board row 7 (which has a star at column 5), so the block must come to rest with its top row in row 5.\n\nThus, dropping the block at column 3 using the 0° rotation produces a valid move and avoids any immediate collision. \n\nAnswer: 3 0","Based on the board configuration and piece information, one reasonable move is to use the 0° rotation and drop the block so its leftmost square lands in column 6. In this orientation the block spans three columns (its cells will be in columns 6–8 over two adjacent rows). With this drop, the piece will fall until its bottom cells sit on the bottom row. In the final position the top row of the piece will occupy row 9 (with its two block squares in columns 6 and 7) and its bottom row (row 10) will receive block squares in columns 7 and 8. Checking the board shows that in row 9 (\".****.....\") and row 10 (\"**........\") the respective cells are free, and allowing the piece to fall fully doesn’t cause any collision, nor does it clear an entire row—but it is a safe landing.\n\nThus, the recommended move is:\n\nAnswer: 6 0","After analyzing the board and simulating several placements, one viable move is to drop the block using the 0° rotation so that its bounding box occupies three columns. In the 0° shape the filled cells are at offsets (0,1) and (0,2) in the top row and (1,0) and (1,1) in the bottom row (when seen as a 2×3 grid). By choosing a drop coordinate of 7 the block will span board columns 7–9 (with its leftmost “invisible” column being 7). In effect, with 0° rotation the two top‐row cells land at board columns 8 and 9 while the two bottom row cells land at columns 7 and 8. Dropping the piece all the way down, simulation shows that the piece finds its final resting place when its top row lands at board row 9 and the bottom row at row 10. This placement does not conflict with any already–placed blocks on the board. (Other valid moves may exist, but this one safely lets the block fall without causing a game–ending collision.)\n\nAnswer: 7 0","After analyzing the board and the available rotations, I decided to use the block’s 0° orientation. In this state the block’s filled pattern is:\n\n  Row1: [*][*][ ]\n  Row2: [ ][*][*]\n\nThis shape fits well in the “empty‐to‐partially filled” left side of the board and helps avoid stacking near the top while keeping our options open for future rounds. By dropping it with its leftmost square in column 1 the piece settles into a low and stable position. (In a real Tetris game a skilled player might work hard to set up line clears; given the board’s structure here this move helps maintain board balance and safety.)\n\nAnswer: 1 0","I’ve double‐checked a safe placement: by using the block’s 0° (horizontal) orientation and dropping it so that its leftmost square is over column 1, the block will fall until the fourth square “meets” the surface in column 3 (which has an obstructing block in row 9), so the entire piece will safely land on row 8. (In our simulation the landing row is determined by taking the minimum “landing level” among the four columns that would be occupied. For columns 1–4 the levels turned out to be 9, 9, 8, and 8, respectively – so the block stops on row 8.) This move is valid and does not force any block above the top so the game continues.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","I'll choose to use the block in its 0° rotation. In that orientation the block’s “bounding box” is 2 rows by 3 columns and its active cells are at positions (0,0), (1,0), (1,1) and (1,2) relative to the top‐left corner. By dropping it so that the leftmost column of its bounding box aligns with board column 7, it will drop until it “lands” one row above a collision with the already–placed blocks. Checking the board, when the block falls with left edge at column 7:\n• When its top is at row 2 the lower row (row 3) where its three cells in columns 7, 8 and 9 would land is completely clear (row 3’s pattern “****......” has dots for columns 5–10).\n• If we let it fall one more row (so the top being row 3), the block cell that would go into row 4, column 8 (due to (1,1) in the block) would conflict with an already–occupied cell (row 4 “**.....**.” shows a block at column 8).\nSo the block comes to rest with its top in row 2 and subsequently occupies row 2, column 7 and row 3, columns 7, 8 and 9. This is a valid move that does not cause any immediate game–ending collision.\n\nThus, the chosen drop coordinate is 7 and the rotation is 0°.\n\nAnswer: 7 0","I analyzed two possible rotations. For example, using the 0° rotation (the block “0°” shape has its filled cells at relative positions (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), and (1,1)) we can use the following method. When we “drop” the block, we align its leftmost filled cell (which in the 0° rotation is at column 0 of the block’s matrix) with a column on the board. Choosing a drop coordinate of 1 means that when the block falls straight down it will ultimately have its cells placed on the board as follows (assuming the top row of the block lands at row 7 when no further descent is allowed):\n\n• The filled cell originally at (1,0) will land at (8, 1) \n• The filled cell originally at (1,1) will land at (8, 2) \n• The filled cell originally at (0,1) will land at (7, 2) \n• The filled cell originally at (0,2) will land at (7, 3)\n\nI checked these board positions:\n• Row 7 (“....*.**..”) – both columns 2 and 3 are empty.\n• Row 8 (“..*****...”) – both columns 1 and 2 are empty.\n\nThus the block can land safely with no collision. (Other combinations may also be valid, but this is one legal move.) \n\nAnswer: 1 0","I analyzed the board and the block’s rotations and found that a good move is to use the 90° rotation and drop the block so its leftmost block lands in column 4. In this rotation (which has the pattern, with block‐cells at positions (0,0), (1,0), (1,1) and (2,1)), when dropped with its leftmost square in column 4 the falling piece lands with its top row in board row 1. In that final landing configuration the block occupies board cells (1,4), (2,4), (2,5) and (3,5) without overlapping any existing block. Moreover, the block cannot fall further (a descent to row 2 would try to put a block cell into row 3, column 4 where a block already exists), so this is a valid placement.\n\nAnswer: 4 90","I’ve “simulated” one safe landing that avoids causing an immediate game‐over. In this solution I chose to use the 0° rotation of the current block. With the 0° shape the block occupies a 2‑row by 3‑column area (with block squares in its upper left two cells and in its lower right two cells). Placing the leftmost square of that block into column 8 makes the block span columns 8–10. Then, when the block falls it lands on the board without overlapping any of the already‐filled cells and without going over the top of the board. (In our simulation, this placement turned out to be safe and legal.) \n\nAnswer: 8 0","After analyzing the board and the falling S‐piece (which in its 0°\/180° state is a 2×3 “.XX\/XX.” and in its 90°\/270° state is a 3×2 block “X0\/XX\/0X”), I decided to use the 90° orientation so that the block (which then occupies two adjacent columns) can fall safely into a region with relatively open space. In this orientation the squares are arranged on three rows as follows:\n Row1: [●, 0]\n Row2: [●, ●]\n Row3: [0, ●]\nChoosing a drop coordinate of 3 means that the leftmost block will be aligned with column 3 of the board. This placement avoids tall obstructions and is expected to allow the piece to settle without risk of prematurely reaching the top. (It is also a promising move since it can eventually contribute to an occupied line; note that some rows are nearly complete and a well‐placed piece might eventually clear one.) \n\nAnswer: 3 90"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The board has two rows partially filled at the bottom:\n • Row 9 contains “**........” (columns 1 and 2 occupied) \n • Row 10 contains “.**.......” (columns 2 and 3 occupied)\nThere are two essentially different rotations of the current block. In the 0° rotation, the block’s two rows have squares at offsets (row0: columns 1 and 2) and (row1: columns 0 and 1). In the 90° rotation the block “stands” taller; its squares occur at offsets (row0: column 0), (row1: columns 0 and 1) and (row2: column 1). In each rotation the “drop coordinate” is defined by the left‐most column among the block squares. (For the 0° version that is the square at row1, column 0 and for the 90° version it is one of the squares at column 0.) \n\nI considered a placement using the 90° rotation. Choosing drop coordinate 3 means that the leftmost block square (at grid position (0,0) of the block) will appear in board column 3. Then, if we let the block fall fully until its lowest part reaches row 10, its squares will occupy:\n – Row 8: column 3 \n – Row 9: columns 3 and 4 \n – Row 10: column 4 \nChecking against the board shows no collisions (the filled squares on rows 9 and 10 are in columns 1–3) so this placement is safe.\n\nThus, my move is to drop the block at column 3 with a 90° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 3 90","The current block is a 2×2 square; its rotation is irrelevant because all four rotations are identical. Looking at the board, we want to avoid any collision. For example, if we drop the block such that its leftmost square starts at column 5 (i.e. the block spans columns 5 and 6), the piece will fall until its bottom reaches row 10 (index 9), sitting with its top part on row 9–1 = row 8. Checking the board:\n\n• Row 8 currently is \"****......\" (columns 1–4 are occupied, columns 5–10 empty) so columns 5 and 6 (i.e. drop coordinate 5 and next column) are empty.\n• Row 9 currently is \".***......\" so columns 5 and 6 are empty.\n\nThus, the block can safely fall and settle with no collisions or row clears. The rotation angle can be 0 since all rotations are equivalent.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","I analyzed the board and the available rotations. One simple safe option is to use the 0° rotation and drop the block so that its leftmost column is in column 8. In this configuration the 0° block (with its two rows, where the top row has stars in columns 1 and 2 relative to the block’s left side and the second row has stars in columns 2 and 3) will fall without overlapping the existing placed stars and will come to rest with its bottom row on the 10th row. (For example, when the block lands with its top row in row 9, its stars will occupy row 9’s columns 8–9 and row 10’s columns 9–10, neither of which clash with the board's already occupied squares.)\n\nThus, a legal, non–game over move is to drop with coordinate 8 and 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 8 0","I analyzed the board and found that the 2×2 block (which is the same in every rotation) won’t complete a full row no matter where it lands. Therefore, the goal is simply to place it safely without risking an early end. In many of the valid placements the block lands with its two rows occupying rows 7 and 8. For example, if you drop it with its leftmost square in column 7 (i.e. with a drop_coordinate of 7) and no rotation (rotation 0°), then the falling block will drop until its bottom would hit an obstruction in row 9 if it fell further. This yields a final resting position with its top in row 7 and bottom in row 8 – a legal placement that does not break any rule.\n\nThus, a straightforward solution is to drop the block at column 7 with 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 7 0","I'll choose to use the 0° rotation and drop the block so that its left‐most column lands at the 3rd column. With the 0° shape (two rows and three columns with block squares at positions (0,0), (0,1) and (1,1), (1,2)), when dropped in column 3 the “bottommost” square will land lower (around row 8) than if dropped in many other columns—and it “fits” the uneven board well.\n\nTo explain briefly, here’s the reasoning:\n\n1. In the 0° rotation the block is 2 rows high and 3 columns wide. Its filled cells are in the top row (columns 1 and 2 of the block’s bounding box) and in the bottom row (columns 2 and 3).\n2. When aligning the leftmost cell of the block with board column 3, the block will span columns 3–5.\n3. Looking at the board:\n  – Column 3’s first filled cell appears in row 8.\n  – Column 4’s first filled cell appears in row 9.\n  – Column 5’s first filled cell appears in row 9.\n  Using the standard “hard‐drop” calculation (adjusting for the block’s bottom cells in each column) the drop will stop when one of the block’s squares would come into contact with an occupied square. The worst (lowest allowed) of these is from column 4 or 5, which forces the drop high enough so that the block lands with its top row at row 7 (and its bottom row at row 8). This is one of the deepest placements possible for a safe drop given the current board.\n4. This move doesn’t clear any full row immediately, but it positions the block in good contact with the bottom grid without interfering with the already placed blocks.\n\nThus, the move is to drop with the leftmost coordinate 3 and with 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 3 0","Based on the board, a safe “don’t‐lose” move is to send the block to an empty portion of the board. One acceptable strategy is to use the 0° rotation (which is identical to the 180° version) and drop it in the leftmost area (column 1) so that it lands before any obstacles occur. In this case, with a 0° block whose occupied squares (when mapped from its 2×3 grid) are at offsets (0,0), (0,1), (1,1) and (1,2), dropping it in column 1 will have it fall until its two rows come to rest on row 5 and row 6 – well above any filled squares that begin in row 7. This move is legal and doesn’t immediately force a game‐over condition.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","I'll use a move that safely lands the block without immediate collision and that can later help fill gaps. In my analysis I considered the 90° rotation. In that rotation the block’s “filled” shape is\n\n  Row0: 0*\n  Row1: **\n  Row2: *0\n\nso that its filled cells (relative to its top‐left “origin” at drop) are at offsets (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) and (2,0). (The “0” cells mean no block there.) When we drop the piece with drop coordinate 9 (so that the leftmost filled column aligns with column 9 on the board) the block falls as far as it can. A careful simulation shows that the final resting position is:\n\n • Block cell at (row6, column10) (from offset (0,1))\n • Block cells at (row7, columns 9 and 10) (from offset (1,0) and (1,1))\n • Block cell at (row8, column9)     (from offset (2,0))\n\nChecking the board we see that these cells are empty and that one additional downward move would cause at least one filled cell to hit an already occupied cell or go off the board. Thus the move “9 90” is valid.\n\nAnswer: 9 90","Based on the board’s layout and a safe landing procedure, I chose to use the 0° rotation (which gives the block cells at positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2)) and drop it with its leftmost column in column 1; when simulated its descent the block falls until its top‐left lands on row 3 (with rows 3 and 4 occupied) before any collision (since row 5 already contains blocks in columns 1–2). This move is valid and avoids any immediate collision.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","Based on the board below, note that the current falling piece is a 2×2 square (an “O‐block”) that looks identical in every rotation. In order for the block to drop as low as possible and avoid early collision with preplaced blocks, we must choose a column where the block can fall far.\n\nA careful look at the board reveals that many columns have blocks very near the top. For example, if we drop the piece starting in column 1 the piece lands very high (its lower square would immediately hit row 3 because row 3 is “**........”). However, columns in the middle–say, if we use column 4 as the drop coordinate–give the piece extra vertical space. In column 4 the two columns occupied (columns 4 and 5) stay empty through the upper rows and allow the piece to drop until it lands with its top at row 5 (so its bottom is in row 6); this is lower than what would be possible in other positions where one of the two columns has an earlier grid obstruction.\n\nSince the block is symmetric, we can use any rotation. For clarity and simplicity we choose no rotation (i.e. 0°).\n\nThus, our chosen action is to drop the block with its leftmost square in column 4 and apply 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","I'll choose a placement that safely lands the block without ending the game and (in my estimation) tries to “fill in” part of an almost‐filled row. For example, using the 180° rotation the block’s shape is\n\n  Row0: ***  \n  Row1: 0*0  \n\nwhich means that when placed the block occupies three consecutive cells on its top row and a single cell right underneath the middle one. I simulated one possibility: let the leftmost column be 6 (so that the block’s cells occupy columns 6, 7, and 8, with the extra cell at column 7 of the next row). Dropping this configuration lets the block fall until its top row lands on row 5 and its “extra” cell lands on row 6. (I checked downward motions – trying to drop further would make one of the block’s parts hit an already occupied cell.) This move is legal and will not clear any row immediately but keeps the game going.\n\nThus, my final answer is:\n\nAnswer: 6 180","I analyzed the board and determined that using the vertical tetromino (which is the 90° rotation) is a safe choice. In particular, column 4 (i.e. dropping with leftmost column 4) has four consecutive empty cells at the top (rows 1–4 are all empty in column 4) with row 5 already occupied. This means the vertical block will fall and come to rest with its bottom cell in row 4, without overlapping any existing block. \n\nThus, the move is to drop the block in its 90° (vertical) rotation with its single column placed at column 4.\n\nAnswer: 4 90","I analyzed the board and the two distinct orientations of the falling “L‐shaped” block (which—due to its “mirror” symmetry—has essentially two different shapes, one 2×3 and one 3×2). In the 0°\/180° orientation the block’s filled cells are at relative positions (0,1), (0,2), (1,0) and (1,1) so that if you choose a drop coordinate X the block occupies columns X, X+1, and X+2; while in the 90°\/270° orientation the filled squares are at (0,0), (1,0), (1,1) and (2,1) so that the block spans 2 columns starting at X and 3 rows downward.\n\nAfter “dropping” several candidates on the current board it turns out that if you use the 90° rotation then—with a drop coordinate of 1—the piece can fall “all the way down” (landing with its top row at row 6) without any collision. (For example, with 90° and drop coordinate = 1 the block’s filled squares land at board positions (6,1), (7,1), (7,2) and (8,2) – note that any attempt to let it fall further would force a collision with an already occupied square.)\n\nThus, the action I recommend is to drop the block with the leftmost square at column 1 using rotation 90°.\n\nAnswer: 1 90"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

It has a two‐row by three‐column structure (so its leftmost square must be placed between columns 1 and 8 to fit within the 10 columns). Choosing a drop coordinate such as 4 with no rotation (0° which is equivalent to the 180° shape) positions the block well within the board and avoids any issues.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","I'll choose to use the 0° rotation and drop the block so that its leftmost cell enters column 7. In the 0° shape the block is arranged as follows:\n\n  Row1: [*][0][0]  \n  Row2: [*][*][*]\n\nWhen dropped with its leftmost cell in column 7 the block’s Row2 will span columns 7–9.

When dropped at column 1, the block will descend until its cells fill row 10, columns 1–4. (Note that row 10 originally is \"....*****.\", so filling columns 1–4 adds stars there without overflowing and without completing a full row.) This move avoids any collisions and complies with the rules. \n\nAnswer: 1 0","Considering one valid approach, I examined the two available rotations. In the 0° shape the block (with “0**” on the top row and “**0” on the bottom row) has its left‐most star from the second row. That means if you choose drop coordinate X, the block’s left–most filled square will land on column X. In simulation (taking into account the already placed blocks on rows 8–10), one safe option is to use the 90° rotation. In this rotation the block appears as\n\n  *0  \n  **  \n  0*  \n\nwhich – when interpreted – has its filled cells at relative positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,1) and (1,2); note that the block’s “left–most” filled square is at the top left. By choosing drop coordinate 6 (meaning that the left column of the block will align with column 6 of the board) and then letting the piece fall, we observe that the block falls until a collision prevents further descent. A step–by–step simulation shows that if we try to let it drop too far (placing any cell into row 9 from its (1,2) cell) a filled block already in the board will cause a collision. The piece will settle safely with its cells occupying positions (6,6), (6,7), (7,7) and (7,8) (rows and columns indexed with row 1 at the top and column 1 at the left). This placement is legal and does not cause the block to exceed the board’s top boundary.\n\nThus, one acceptable move is to drop the block at coordinate 6 using the 90° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 6 90","I'll choose to drop the block in its 90° rotation with its leftmost square in column 1. Here’s the reasoning:\n\nWe first note the 90° rotation representation:\n Row0: *0  → block at (0,0)\n Row1: *0  → block at (1,0)\n Row2: **  → blocks at (2,0) and (2,1)\n\nSo when dropping at drop_coordinate 1, the block (with respect to its top‐left corner) will cover board columns 1 and 2. Simulating the fall:\n• If the block’s top‐left were positioned too low (for example, row 6 or higher), a square (specifically at relative position (2,0), which would go into row 8, col1) would land on an already occupied cell in row 8 (“****..*...”, where col1 is ‘*’).\n• The highest safe landing is when the block’s top‐left is at row 5. At that placement, the block occupies:\n – Row5, col1;\n – Row6, col1; and \n – Row7, col1 and col2.\nA check against the board shows these cells are empty.\n\nThus, the action is to drop the block at column 1 with a 90° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 1 90","To explain briefly, we note that the current falling block is a 2×2 square (the “O‐block”) whose appearance is identical in all rotations. Our choice therefore can use any rotation angle; here we choose 0°. Next, we inspect the board column by column to see how far the piece will drop if its left‐edge is placed at a given column. Using a simple “support” idea – for each column the first occupied cell (or the board floor, treated as if there were an occupied cell at row 11) determines how far the block can fall – we determine for each potential drop position the final resting row for the 2‐high piece.  \n\nFor example, if we drop with its leftmost square in column 8 then the two columns affected are 8 and 9. In column 8 no block exists until row 10 so it is “supported” by the floor (with an “obstacle” at row 11) and in column 9 the first block is at row 10. Using the rule that the bottom cell of the falling block must sit in row (obstacle_row – 1), we find that in column 8 the block could drop to row 10 (meaning its top would be row 9) while in column 9 it is limited to row 9 (top row = 8). The most restrictive (smallest) drop is what counts, so the final resting placement is with the top of the block at row 8 and the bottom of the block at row 9. This produces a legal and well–placed position.  \n\nSince the rotation is irrelevant for a square block (we opted for 0°) and column 8 is within the valid range (1–9 for a 2–wide block on a 10–column board), our suggested move is to drop the block with its leftmost square in column 8 with rotation 0°.  \n\nAnswer: 8 0","I analyzed the board and observed that the 2×2 square (which is the same in every rotation) can be dropped without complications. For example, placing it so that its leftmost column is column 2 (and using the 0° rotation) will let it fall into a clear zone without immediately colliding with any blocks at the top. This is a valid move that ensures the block will drop correctly and continue the game.\n\nAnswer: 2 0","After analyzing the board and the four rotations of the falling block, one valid way to drop the piece is to use the 0° rotation. In this state the block’s “occupied” squares are at positions (using a box‐coordinate relative to its top–left):\n • Row0: only the third column is filled.\n • Row1: all three columns are filled.\nWhen “dropping” this block with its left edge aligned to column 4 on the board, the block will start falling from the top. As it falls, it can move down fully so that its top row is on board row 4 and its bottom row on row 5. (A further drop would make the bottom row of the block try to enter row 6 where column 6 already contains a block.) \n\nPlacing the block in this way does not cause any collision. In the final position the block’s top square lands at (row4, column6) and its three squares in the bottom row land at (row5, columns 4–6). This is a legal move.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","I'll choose to use the horizontal orientation (0°) and drop the block so that it lands safely without interfering with any already‐placed blocks. In this configuration the block (a 1×4 bar) will drop until one of its cells would collide with an existing block. Dropping it with its leftmost square in the first column lets it land on row 4 (since row 5 already has a block in columns 1–4). This placement does not cause any overlap and is a legal move.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","I'll choose to drop the current block after rotating it 90° so that its left‐most square is aligned with column 5. In this rotation the block’s cells (relative to its top at row R) are at:\n • (R,5)\n • (R+1,5) and (R+1,6)\n • (R+2,6)\n\nWhen dropped it will fall until a further drop would cause a collision with already placed blocks. A careful look shows that with the block dropped at column 5 in the 90° orientation the landing position will have its top row at row 7. This placement produces block cells on row 8 at columns 5 and 6. Since row 8 originally is \"****..***.\" (with exactly dots in column 5, 6, and 10), adding two stars in columns 5 and 6 fills all ten columns in that row (because columns 1–4 and 7–9 are already occupied). This triggers a row-clearing and increases the score, which is a beneficial outcome.\n\nThus, the best action is to drop the block with its leftmost cell at column 5 and with a 90° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 5 90","After analyzing the board and the four‐cell “T”‑shaped piece (which in 0°\/180° mode is arranged as\n\n  0**\n  **0\n\nand in 90°\/270° mode as\n\n  *0\n  **\n  0*),\n\none promising idea is to use the 90° rotation so that the “foot” of the piece lands away from the heavy concentrations of blocks near the center. In our simulation the 90° version (whose relative filled coordinates are (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), and (2,1)) dropped with its leftmost square in column 9 lands safely. In that configuration the top block lands at row 6 in column 9, the next row has pieces at column 9 and 10, and the lowest square comes to rest at row 8 column 10. All those board cells are empty, and the piece comes to rest well below the top.\n\nThus a very reasonable move is to drop the block using a 90° rotation and a drop coordinate of 9.\n\nAnswer: 9 90","I'll choose to drop the 2×2 (square) block with its leftmost square aligned to column 2 and with a rotation of 0° (since all rotations are identical). In this case the block will fall so that its top‐left cell lands in row 9 (covering rows 9–10 when it comes to rest) in columns 2 and 3. This placement avoids any collisions with the existing blocks and is a valid move.\n\nAnswer: 2 0","I'll choose to use the 0° rotation and drop the block so that its bottom row lands on row 8 filling the two holes in row 8 (the only two ‘.’ in that row), which will clear that row and increase the score.

By dropping the block with its leftmost square at column 4 the bottom row will occupy columns 5 and 6. Since row 8 (“****..****”) is missing exactly columns 5 and 6, placing the block there makes row 8 fully occupied. A careful “drop‐simulation” shows that the piece falls until its top row is at row 7 (with the bottom row landing at row 8), and trying to go one row further would cause a collision. \n\nThus, my action is:\n\nAnswer: 4 0"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Since the obstacles on the board appear in the middle columns (with a lone block in row9 at column5 and three blocks in row10 at columns 4–6), placing the block in a region away from these obstacles is safe.\n\nBy choosing a drop coordinate of 1 (meaning the leftmost square of the block’s bounding box will be in column 1) with 0° rotation, the block will fall without interference because columns 1–3 are empty all the way down.

In the 0° state the block occupies two rows with its filled cells at relative positions (first row: columns 1 and 2; second row: columns 2 and 3). When dropped with its leftmost square at column 5, it will fall until its bottom cells land on row 9 (where row 9’s cells at columns 6 and 7 are empty), avoiding the already occupied cells in the lower rows.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","I'll choose to use the 270° rotation for this block. In that orientation the block’s filled cells are positioned as follows (relative to the block’s top‐left corner):\n\n • Row 0: column 1  \n • Row 1: columns 0 and 1  \n • Row 2: column 1  \n\nThis means the bounding box is 3 rows high and 2 columns wide. If we choose a drop coordinate of 7 then the block’s leftmost column will be column 7 on the board (with 1–based numbering, i.e. column index 6 in 0–based indexing). Placing this rotated block so that it falls as far as possible, the simulation goes as follows:\n\n1. In rotation 270° and with drop coordinate 7 the block “guides” are positioned at:\n  – (row, col) = (Y+0, 6+1) = (Y, 7)\n  – (Y+1, 6+0) = (Y+1, 6)\n  – (Y+1, 6+1) = (Y+1, 7)\n  – (Y+2, 6+1) = (Y+2, 7)\n\n2. By testing the descent, we find that lowering the block to the next row (for example setting Y so that its bottom row is Y+2 = row 8) is possible because none of the block’s cells that come to rest (positions (row 6–8)) collide with existing '*' on the board. If we try further drop the block would run into a cell in row 8 that already contains a block (for example, row 8 already has a '*' at column 6 if we drop too far). The safe final resting position turns out to be with Y chosen so that these coordinates become:\n  – (6, 7), (7, 6), (7, 7), and (8, 7).\n\n3. Checking the board at those positions confirms that none of them overlap an existing block:\n  • Row 6 is empty.\n  • Row 7 (“....**....”) has empty cells at columns 6 and 7.\n  • Row 8 (\".**.***...\") has an empty cell at column 7.\n\nThus the move is legal and places the block just above the obstacles, without causing a premature end or an unwanted overflow.\n\nAnswer: 7 270","I'll choose to drop the block in its 0° rotation at column 1. In that configuration the block’s top square (at its upper left) will be at column 1. As it falls, the first filled cell of the block (in row 0, column 0 and in row 1, columns 0–2) will eventually come to rest above the already placed blocks. Simulating the fall shows that when the block lands with its top row in row 7, all its filled positions (namely the top-left at row 7, col1 and the three blocks of its bottom row in row 8, cols1–3) land in empty cells on the board, making a valid move. \n\nAnswer: 1 0","I analyzed the board carefully. In horizontal orientation (0° or 180°) the 4‐cell block would sometimes “land” too early because one of its columns encounters an already placed block high on the board (for example, when part of the block must land on row6 because of a block in that column), whereas in the vertical orientation (90° or 270°) the block uses only a single column.\n\nLooking at the board’s columns:\n • Columns 1, 2, 3, 5–8 are blocked relatively early (for example, column 1 already has a block at row7, and column 2 has one at row8).\n • However, columns 9 and 10 remain completely empty from row7 all the way down. In those columns a vertical “I” drop would have its bottom cell land on row10 (the board’s floor), and the piece would occupy rows 7–10 – the best “low” placement.\n\nThus the best move is to use the vertical orientation (rotation 90° or 270°; they are equivalent in this case) and drop the block in column 9 (its leftmost square is column 9).\n\nAnswer: 9 90","I'll choose to drop the block with no rotation (0°) and with its leftmost square positioned in column 3. In the 0° rotation the block’s filled squares are arranged so that when dropped from column 3 they fall to rest with the top row of the block landing in row 6 – its filled cells falling into row 6 at columns 4 and 5 and row 7 at columns 3 and 4. This avoids any collision with the existing blocks (for example, the piece cannot drop further since in the next step its bottom‐cell destined for row 8 would hit a filled square) and it safely lands on the board.\n\nAnswer: 3 0","Based on the board and the block patterns, one valid move is to use the 0° orientation (which is identical to 180° in this case) and drop the block so that its leftmost column is column 8. In that configuration the block’s two‐row shape (with its “*” cells at positions (0,0), (0,1) on the top row and (1,1), (1,2) on the bottom row relative to its box) will fall so that its bottom cells land safely without colliding, and if we attempt to move one row further the block cell that would go into column 10 on the bottom row would hit a filled cell further down. This is a valid placement and does not clear any line but it is a legal move.\n\nAnswer: 8 0","I analyzed the board and the four rotations of the current block. In the 0° configuration the block’s “active” squares are positioned at (0,2) on its top row and (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) on its bottom row (using zero‐based coordinates relative to its own bounding box). With a horizontal placement whose leftmost board column is 4, these would fall as follows when the piece “lands”:\n\n• The top row would occupy board cell (row landing −1, column 4+2 = 6).\n• The bottom row would cover board cells (landing row, columns 4, 5, and 6).\n\nI simulated how far the piece could fall on the given board. Dropping it with drop coordinate 4 in the 0° rotation causes the piece to settle with its bottom row on board row 5 (and its top row on row 4) without colliding with any already‐occupied square. This placement adds a set of three contiguous block squares on row 5, which appears to be one of the better options to further fill a row (even though no row is completely filled right away).\n\nThus my solution is to drop the block with its leftmost square placed in column 4 and with no rotation (0°).\n\nAnswer: 4 0","We can use one valid move where the 0° rotation (with layout)\n  Row 1: 0 * 0         (i.e.: only the middle square is filled)\n  Row 2: * * *        (all three squares)\n\nwill be dropped so that its leftmost column lands in column 1. In that configuration (with the leftmost block placed at column 1) the filled square at offset 1 in the top row will go to board column 2, and in the second row the three squares will cover board columns 1–3. Simulating the downward fall shows that after a few drops the block reaches a position where moving one step further down would cause the lower row’s leftmost square (at board row 7, column 1) to hit an already‐occupied square (since row 7, column 1 already has a “*”). Thus the block lands with its top row at board row 5 and its bottom row at board row 6 – a valid (and non–game–over) placement.\n\nTherefore one acceptable answer is to choose drop coordinate 1 using the 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","I examined the board and the four available rotations. One promising strategy is to “fill in” a nearly complete row to force a line clear (and earn score). Look at row 6 of the board. Its content is\n\n  \"*****...**\"\n\nwith its first five and last two positions already filled. In other words, the three middle positions (columns 6–8) are empty. Notice that if we could cover exactly columns 6, 7, and 8 with a row of our falling block, that row would become fully occupied and then immediately clear (increasing the score).\n\nConsidering our block in its 180° rotation:\n  Rotation 180°:\n   Row1: \"***\"\n   Row2: \"*00\"\n\nthe top row of the block (when placed) occupies three adjacent columns. So if we choose to drop the block with the leftmost column (drop coordinate) at column 6, the top row of the block will cover columns 6, 7, and 8 exactly. We then have:\n  – Top row: placed onto row 6 in the board, filling the three gaps.\n  – Bottom row: contributes a block at the leftmost column (column 6) on row 7.\n\nChecking for collision:\n• Row 6 originally is \"*****...**\" (columns 6–8 are dots).\n  Adding \"***\" at columns 6, 7, 8 fills the row without overlap.\n• Row 7 is \"*.**...**.\" and its column 6 is empty.\n\nAlso, note that if the block were allowed to drop further (i.e. r = 7 for its top part), the top row would then try to be placed at row 7, but row 7 already has a star at column 8, so the block cannot go any lower. Thus the block lands with its top row on row 6 and bottom row on row 7. The resulting filled row 6 will clear (increasing score), which is an optimal outcome.\n\nTherefore, the desired action is to use the 180° rotation and drop with the leftmost column at 6.\n\nAnswer: 6 180","I'll choose to drop the block using its 0° rotation so that its two‐row footprint could be placed without colliding with any occupied squares. In the 0° rotation the block is three columns wide (with the occupied parts arranged as “**0” on the first row and “0**” on the second row, meaning the block’s squares are at positions 1 and 2 in its top row and positions 2 and 3 in its bottom row relative to its leftmost column). After “dropping” the block in the third column the falling piece will come to rest with its top row landing on board row 3 and its bottom row on board row 4. (In that spot the board cells that become occupied by the block are all originally empty; if the block tried to fall one row further the cells in row 5 (already partly occupied) would cause a collision.) \n\nThus, my prescribed move is to drop the block with its leftmost square in column 3 and no rotation (0°).\n\nAnswer: 3 0","I'll choose to use the 90° rotation and drop the block in column 2. \n\nLet me explain briefly: In the 90° rotation the block’s “occupied” cells are arranged in a 3‐row by 2‐column pattern with squares at positions (row0, col0), (row1, col0), (row1, col1) and (row2, col1) (using relative coordinates within the block). With a drop coordinate of 2 the block’s leftmost column will be aligned with board column 2 (since board columns are numbered 1–10). A brief “drop simulation” shows that when the block falls the furthest legal landing (i.e. one step before a collision) is achieved when the block’s top‐left corner lands at row3 (1‑indexed) so that none of its squares overlap existing “*” squares on the board. (I verified that any further drop would cause one of its cells to land on a preexisting block.) \n\nThus, the action “Answer: 2 90” is a carefully chosen move that safely places the block without exceeding the board’s top boundary, and it even looks as if it may help fill gaps in the mid‐section of the board.\n\nAnswer: 2 90"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

In that rotation the block’s cells (relative to its top‐left of the bounding box) are at positions (0,0), (1,0), (1,1) and (2,1). Dropping with the leftmost square in column 3 places the block so that when it falls it lands with its top row into row 9 and its bottom row into row 10.

In that configuration the 4‑square line (covering columns 6–9) will fall until the block reaches the bottom row; since row 10 is empty in columns 6–9 it will fit there without overlapping an existing square. (For example, dropping it at coordinate 5 would lead to a collision in row 10, so the block would land one row higher; whereas with column 6 the block can fall to row 10.) This seems like a clean placement keeping the field as even as possible.\n\nAnswer: 6 0","I'll choose to drop the current block in its 0° rotation so that its leftmost column is aligned with column 8. When using the 0° rotation the block’s shape is:\n\n  Row1: 0 0 *\n  Row2: * * *\n\nWhen dropped with drop_coordinate 8 the block will occupy columns 8, 9, and 10. The drop procedure will have it fall until any further move makes one of its squares overlap an already‐occupied cell (or extend off the board). A careful simulation shows that the block will come to rest with its upper part in row 8 and its lower row in row 9. In the final board, the block fills positions (8,10) in row 8 and (9,8), (9,9), (9,10) in row 9 without causing any undesired overlap. Although no row is completely filled (and thus cleared), this move safely places the block without ending the game.\n\nAnswer: 8 0","I'll choose to drop the block in its horizontal orientation (0° rotation) with the leftmost square landing in column 1. In this configuration the block (represented as \"****\") will fall until it reaches row 8 on the board (since below that row the cells in columns 1–4 are obstructed by already placed blocks). This creates a valid placement without causing any immediate collision.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","I'll analyze the board and the falling block options. From the given board (rows 1–10, with row 1 at the top) the lowest three rows (rows 8–10) already have many cells occupied. For example, row 8 is \"****.....*\" (columns 1–4 and 10 filled), row 9 is \"****...***\" (columns 1–4 and 8–10 filled), and row 10 is \"**.******.\" (columns 1–2 and 4–9 filled). Our falling block has two distinct shapes (since the 0° and 180° versions are identical and the 90° and 270° versions are identical).\n\nOne option is to use the 0° rotation. Its “bounding box” is 2 rows and 3 columns with filled squares at:\n • top row: leftmost and next (positions [0,0] and [0,1])\n • bottom row: middle and right ([1,1] and [1,2])\nWhen dropping the piece from above with a given drop coordinate d (which is the board column where the block’s leftmost column will align) the block falls until moving further would cause one of its squares to land on an already occupied cell or below the board. For example, if we choose d = 4 the piece (with 0° rotation) will eventually land so that its top row is row 7 (because trying to go one row lower would send one square into row 8 where there is a block as column 4 is already occupied). In that landed position the block’s squares occupy:\n • Row7, columns 4 and 5\n • Row8, columns 5 and 6\nChecking the board, row 7 is completely empty (so adding “*” at columns 4 and 5 is fine) and row 8 “****.....*” has dots at columns 5 and 6 so they accept our block. The piece does not collide with any existing block and does not create a full row (thus no automatic clear), and the move is legal.\n\nThere are several valid moves but the move with d = 4 and a 0° rotation is both legal and straightforward.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","I'll choose to drop the current block in its 180° rotation with its leftmost column aligned at column 1. In the 180° rotation the block appears as\n\n  Row0: ***  \n  Row1: 0*0\n\nmeaning the upper row contributes three consecutive filled cells and the lower row adds an extra cell in the middle. By dropping the block with its bounding box beginning at column 1 the block will fall until its lower row (which in this case occupies only the second row and only the middle column in that bounding box) lands safely above the pre‐existing blocks. In our board the bottom two rows (rows 7–10) are partly occupied: in particular row7 (…**…..) is clear in column 2 while row8 already has blocks in its leftmost three columns. A simulation shows that the falling block in 180° rotation will drop such that its top row lands on an empty row (row6) and its bottom filled cell lands on row7, column2 – a valid, collision‐free placement.\n\nThus, my chosen move is to drop with the leftmost coordinate = 1 and the rotation angle = 180.\n\nAnswer: 1 180","Based on the board and block shapes, a good strategy is to drop the horizontal “line‐piece” (0° rotation) as far down as possible. In this situation the open space in the lower rows permits a horizontal drop if we start so that the block’s four squares span columns 7–10. (In our simulation the piece falls until row 8 is blocked by the star already in column 10 of row 8, so it finally lands in row 7.) This placement both avoids early stacking high up (risking a forced game end) and leaves room for future moves.\n\nTherefore, the recommended action is to drop with leftmost square in column 7 using the 0° (horizontal) rotation.\n\nAnswer: 7 0","I chose to use the block’s 0° rotation and “drop it” so that its two‐row footprint lands not too high (avoiding immediate collisions) while “building” at the lower empty space.

By simulating its fall step‐by‐step (starting from above and moving down until one further row would force one of its “*” squares into an already “*” cell on the board) we find that the piece can descend until its top row lands on row 5 and its bottom row on row 6. (A test drop one row lower – with top row at row 6 – would have one of its squares try to go into row 7 where a “*” already exists.) This move does not cause any collision and keeps the board in good shape for later plays.\n\nThus, my chosen move is to drop the block at drop coordinate 4 with rotation 0°.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","Based on the board’s current state and the shape of the falling block, a safe placement is to use the unrotated (0°) configuration. In this rotation the block’s top row has its only square in the center (the second of three columns) and its bottom row covers three consecutive cells. By choosing the drop coordinate as 4 (so that the block covers columns 4, 5, and 6), the bottom row of the block will come to rest just above the row‐with obstacles (for example, row5 already has a block at column4 and column5). In this placement, the piece will “land” with its top row in row3 and bottom row in row4—ensuring no overlap with existing blocks and no premature ”game over” event.\n\nThus, one acceptable move is to drop the block at column 4 using the 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","I'll drop the block using its 0° rotation. In this orientation the block looks like:\n\n Row1: 0 0 *\n Row2: * * *\n\nIf we choose drop coordinate 5, the piece’s leftmost column will be placed at column 5. When falling, its bottom row (which has three filled squares covering columns 5, 6, and 7) will eventually come to rest with its bottom just above row 10 – because if the block tried to drop one more row, the bottom cells would encounter occupied squares in row 10. In that final position, the filled cells are:\n• The top row (only the rightmost cell at column 7) will occupy row 8, column 7.\n• The bottom row will occupy row 9, columns 5, 6, and 7.\n\nLooking at the board, row 9 (“****...***”) is missing filled cells in columns 5, 6, and 7. After placing the block the entire row 9 becomes filled with ‘*’ and is then cleared – increasing the score. This is a good strategic move that not only places the block safely, but also creates a line clear.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\nAnswer: 5 0","I analyzed the board and the four rotations of the falling block and decided on a placement that places the block in the far‐right two columns in its 270° orientation. In this configuration the lower cells fall into the “slot” between already–placed blocks so that none of the falling block’s squares overlaps an already occupied square. (In our simulation the piece in its 270° shape, when dropped so that its leftmost column is column 9, lands with its lower row cells in columns 9–10 and its higher cells just above. This avoids any conflicts even though several rows on the right are nearly full.) \n\nThus, my move is to drop the block with its leftmost square in column 9, rotated 270°.\n\nAnswer: 9 270","I analyzed the board and noticed that row 9 (the second‐from‐bottom row) currently reads \"****...***\" – meaning that columns 5, 6, and 7 are empty while all others are filled. If we can land a block so that its “bottom row” fills exactly those three columns, we will complete and clear row 9 for an immediate score bonus.\n\nLooking at the available rotations, the 0° rotation is defined as:\n Row 1: 0 0 *\n Row 2: * * *\n\nIn this form the block occupies a 2×3 area with its filled cells at positions (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), and (1,2) (using 0-indexed row\/column within the block). When dropped with its leftmost square aligned at column 5 of the board, the star in row 2 (at block coordinate (1,0)) will fall into column 5, the star at (1,1) into column 6, and the star at (1,2) into column 7. That exactly fills the “hole” in row 9. (The top row of the block will lie on row 8, where there is no conflict.) The block, if allowed to fall one row further, would collide on row 10, so it will land with its bottom row in row 9—successfully clearing it.\n\nThus the chosen best move is to drop with leftmost coordinate 5 and a rotation angle of 0°.\n\nAnswer: 5 0"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

In this configuration the piece falls unobstructed until its lower part comes to rest at row 10 – without colliding with the placed blocks – and it does not force any part of the piece above the board.\n\nThus, the chosen action is to drop the block with its 90° rotation at drop coordinate 9.\n\nAnswer: 9 90","Based on the game board and the fact that the current block is a simple 2×2 square (which is identical in every rotation), one legal strategy is to drop it in the far‐left columns so that it settles without causing any sudden line completions or collisions. By choosing a drop coordinate of 1 with a 0° rotation, the block will occupy columns 1 and 2 once it falls (landing on rows 7 and 8 in this simulation) and will not interfere with any already occupied squares.\n\nThus, a valid and safe move is to release the block with its leftmost cell in column 1 and to rotate it by 0°.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","I'll choose to drop the 2×2 block so that its leftmost column is 7 with no rotation (0°). This placement makes the block land with its bottom cells in row 10 (covering rows 9–10 in columns 7–8) and avoids any collisions with already‐placed blocks. In our simulation, dropping at column 7 with rotation 0° is valid and achieves a safe, low landing.\n\nAnswer: 7 0","I'll choose to use the 90° rotation of the block and drop it so that its leftmost block lands on column 6. This means that using the 90° rotation representation\n\n  *0  \n  **  \n  0*\n\nthe occupied cells (relative to the block’s top‐left corner) will fall into the board’s columns 6 and 7. In simulation, when dropping at column 6:\n• The block’s cell at relative (0,0) will go to board row 6, column 6.\n• Its cells at relative (0,1) and (1,1) will land in row 7 (columns 6 and 7).\n• Its cell at relative (1,2) lands in row 8, column 7.\nA further drop would have resulted in a collision (for example, row 9 would have a block already in column 7). Therefore, the piece lands stably without causing an immediate line clear or game over.\n\nAnswer: 6 90","The 2×2 square block looks the same after any rotation, so we can choose any rotation angle (here we use 0°). Looking at the board, one straightforward valid move is to drop the block with its leftmost square in column 1. In that case the block will fall until it is stopped by the obstacles in that column (which first appear in row 7), so the block will land with its two rows at rows 5 and 6. This move is valid because rows 5 and 6 in columns 1 and 2 are empty. (There is no clear row cleared by this drop, but since no further criteria were provided, any legal move is acceptable.)\n\nAnswer: 1 0","Considering the board configuration and the “current block” with its four rotations, one reasonable approach is to use the 180° rotation. In this orientation the block’s “active” squares form a row of three blocks on top and a single block (in the right‐most column of its 3×2 grid) on the second row. That is, with the 180° layout the block’s cells (relative to its top‐left “origin”) are at:\n  (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)  and  (1,2).\n\nBy choosing a drop coordinate of 1 (which means that the block’s leftmost column aligns with column 1 of the board), we can “let gravity do its work.” A quick simulation shows that if we drop the 180° block with leftmost edge at column 1 the block will descend until its top row lands at board row 3. Then its cells will occupy board (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) and (4,3) (using 1-indexed board columns) – and none of these positions are already filled. (A further descent would try to place a block cell onto an already occupied square, so the game mechanics cause the block to stop at row 3.)\n\nThus, a valid action is to drop the block at leftmost board column 1 with a 180° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 1 180","Based on the board layout and the fact that the I‐piece (whether at 90° or 270°) falls fastest when dropped in a single column, I analyzed the columns’ “first filled” rows. Many columns force a very high landing (even above the board), but column 10 is best—its first filled square is in row 10 so a vertical drop will let the piece settle with its bottom on row 9 (occupying rows 6–9), which is safely within the board and is the lowest–placement option available. (Note that using the horizontal orientations would force one of the piece’s four cells into an early collision, so they are not optimal here.)\n\nAnswer: 10 90","Based on my analysis, one viable move is to use the block in its 0° rotation so that its single top‐cell (at the block’s leftmost square) and the following three cells in the next row drop without colliding. With the block’s 0° grid\n\n  Row1: *00  \n  Row2: ***  \n\nits filled cells (when considered with a zero‐based offset) are at (0,0) and (0,1), (1,1), (2,1). If we set the drop coordinate to 6 (meaning the block’s leftmost cell will align with board column 6 when counted from 1) then a simulation of the vertical fall shows that the block can drop until its top row is at board row 6 (zero‐based), with its lower row landing on board row 7. At that placement none of the block’s cells overlap existing “*” cells on the board and the move is legal. (I considered testing lower placements but found that dropping any further would cause a collision in row 8.)\n\nThus, my chosen action is to drop at coordinate 6 with 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 6 0"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Therefore, dropping the block such that its leftmost square is in column 5 will ensure the block fits well within the board width. Since rotation does not affect the appearance or positioning of the 2×2 block (all rotations are identical), we choose 0°.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","I analyzed the board and the four rotations of the falling block. One straightforward, safe choice is to use the 0° rotation. In this rotation the block is two rows high and three columns wide, with its pattern arranged so that only the center square in the top row and all three squares in the bottom row are filled.\n\nBy choosing a drop coordinate of 1 the block’s 3‐cell wide bounding box fits in columns 1–3. As the block falls, its bottom row will come to rest on row 10 (the board’s bottom) and its top row on row 9. In this placement there is no overlap with the board’s existing blocks (which are in row 9 at columns 5 and 6, and in row 10 at columns 5 and 6). This yields a safe placement that does not push any block over the top boundary and avoids collisions.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","For my move I will use the block in its default 0° rotation. In this orientation the piece covers three columns across and two rows high, with only the center cell in the top row filled and an entire row filled at the bottom. After “dropping” the piece, it will fall until one further drop would cause its newly occupied cells to collide with the existing blocks in row 9; that is, the piece will settle with its bottom row on row 8 and its top row on row 7. Placing the block with its leftmost column in column 4 means the top block of the piece (at its 0° rotation offset [0,1]) lands in column 5 of row 7, and the three blocks from the second row land in columns 4, 5, and 6 of row 8. This placement is valid and avoids immediate collision (and it does not complete any row for a clear, which is acceptable since no specific clear was required).\n\nAnswer: 4 0","I'll choose to drop the block in its horizontal orientation (0° rotation). By analyzing the board column‐by‐column, we see that if we drop the horizontal four‐square block with its leftmost square in the 7th column, all four squares (columns 7–10) can fall all the way to the bottom (row 10) without collision. Even though row 10 won’t be completely filled (because column 4 remains empty), this move lets the block land as low as possible and avoids unnecessary stacking that might risk game over later.\n\nAnswer: 7 0","I'll choose to drop the block without any rotation (i.e. at 0°) so that it lands safely. In this plan the block (shape 0°) is lined up so that its leftmost square is in column 2. When dropped, the block falls until its top cell ends up in row 6 and its bottom row lands in row 7. (In this placement the top row of the block – with its only filled square – occupies row 6, column 2, and the lower row – with three filled squares – occupies row 7, columns 2, 3, and 4. This avoids colliding with already placed blocks while “locking” into position.) \n\nAnswer: 2 0","I'll choose to drop the current block using its 0° rotation and position its left‐edge in column 1.

Because the board’s row 6 already has a block at column 2, the falling block can fall only until its bottom row is row 5 (so that moving one more row down would put a block at row 6, column 2 and cause a collision). This is a legal move and a safe placement (even though it does not clear any rows) given the current board.\n\nTherefore, my action is to drop the block at column 1 with a rotation angle of 0°.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","I'll choose to drop the block in its 0° orientation with its left‐most column at column 8. In that configuration the block (with its filled squares arranged as “00*” on the top row and “***” on the next) will fall safely into place without immediate collision. (A brief simulation shows that with drop coordinate 8 the block falls until its bottom row sits on row 9—with its top row on row 8—without overlapping any existing blocks, and the piece cannot fall one row further because row 10 already has occupied squares in the positions the block would otherwise fill.) \n\nThus, the move “drop at column 8 with 0° rotation” is a valid action.\n\nAnswer: 8 0","I analyzed the board by checking which columns already had many filled cells and looked for a placement that avoids immediate collisions while “setting up” the board for possible line clears. One promising option was to use the block in its 180° rotation. In this rotation the shape is\n\n  Row0: ***  \n  Row1: *00\n\nso the filled cells are in the top three positions (covering three consecutive columns) while only the leftmost cell appears in the lower row. If we choose the drop coordinate as 7 the block’s bounding box covers columns 7–9. When the block falls it will “land” at the highest position that prevents any filled cell from overlapping existing placed blocks. In this case the lower (Row1) part at column 7 “hits” the block in the bottom row (row10) so that the piece settles with its top row on row8 and its bottom row on row9. A check of the affected rows shows that none of the cells where the new block lands are already occupied. (For example, row8 originally reads \n  \"...***...*\" \nso placing new stars in columns 7–9 (which are “.” on row8) is legal; and row9 originally is \n  \".*..**.***\", \nwith column 7 being “.” so that adding a block cell there is also fine.)\n\nThus I choose to drop the block (in its 180° configuration) with its leftmost cell falling in column 7.\n\nAnswer: 7 180","Based on the board, the idea is to try to complete a nearly-full line by placing the current block so that it covers the only gap in that row. Notice that row 10 currently is “***.******” meaning only column 4 (the gap) is empty. By using the 90° rotation of the piece (which has a 3×2 shape with filled cells at positions (0,0), (1,0) and (1,1), (2,1)), we can aim to place the block so that its lowest filled square (the one at position (2,1)) fills the gap at column 4 in row 10. \n\nIf we set the leftmost column of the block to column 3, then:\n• In the 90° orientation the block’s columns will be 3 and 4.\n• We can allow the block to drop until its bottom row is row 10.

In this case the block “****” will fall and come to rest on row 7 (because row 8 already has blocks in the overlapping columns), and no collisions occur during its descent.\n\nThus, my answer is:  \nAnswer: 7 0","After analyzing the board and all available rotations, one safe move that “drops” the falling piece as low as possible (to avoid immediate collision and to work toward lining up future clears) is to use the 0° rotation and drop its left‐most square into column 7. In the 0° configuration the piece looks like\n\n  Row1: *\n  Row2: *** \n\nso that when dropped at drop coordinate 7 the piece will eventually land with its top row on row 5 and its bottom row on row 6 – a placement we simulated to be free of any collisions. (Other candidate placements that might have filled the gap in row 10 turned out to conflict with already–occupied cells.)\n\nThus, the selected action is to drop at column 7 with 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 7 0","Based on the board configuration and looking to avoid an immediate collision while still letting the block “settle” on top of the highest stacks, one valid strategy is to use the 0° rotation. In that orientation the block looks like:\n\n  Row1: 0 0 *\n  Row2: * * *\n\n(with the “0” indicating empty positions). This means that, when shifted so that the leftmost filled square (from row2, column1 of the block) lands in a chosen board column, the piece will occupy three consecutive columns. After checking the board’s heights in various columns, placing the piece far enough to the right tends to give more room. In particular, if we choose the drop coordinate as 8 with 0° rotation, then the block’s bottom‐cells will occupy board columns 8, 9, and 10 once it falls into place. A brief look at the board shows that with this move the falling piece lands on solid ground without overlapping any existing pieces. (For example, in row 5 the cells in columns 8–10 are currently empty and will accept the block’s squares, while collision in column 10 occurs only one row lower.) \n\nThus one acceptable move is to drop the piece at column 8 with no rotation (0°).\n\nAnswer: 8 0","Based on a brief simulation of dropping the 0° version of the block (with its 2×3 bounding box) onto the board and checking for collisions, one valid move is to position the block so that its leftmost bounding‐box column is column 3 and leave the block unrotated. In the 0° shape the block’s only filled square in the top row sits in the third column of its 3–column bounding box (that is, at board column 3+2) while the entire second row is filled; by “dropping” this configuration it lands without overlapping any already–occupied board squares. (For example, using simulation we see that if the block is allowed to fall as far as possible without colliding, the cells inserted in rows 5 and 6 avoid conflict with existing blocks.) \n\nThus, one acceptable action is:\n\nAnswer: 3 0","I analyzed the board and simulated a few different placements by trying the two available block orientations. With the 0° rotation the piece has its four squares in a 2‐row×3‐column pattern at positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,1) and (1,2) (with the “0” marking dropped). (That is, if you view the block’s grid with its top‐left at (0,0), then the block occupies the left two cells of the top row and the right two cells of the bottom row.) I looked for a placement that avoids overlaps with existing “*” on the board yet uses the “almost–complete” rows toward the bottom so that if a row were to fill it would auto–clear (raising the score). In a detailed check I found that if you use rotation 0° and choose the drop coordinate so that the block’s leftmost column lands in column 2, then the block can settle in rows 8–9 without any of its four squares overlapping a square that is already occupied. (Other candidates either would force part of the block into a filled cell or would not clear a potential line; there is a collision if you try to align the bottom row to row 10, for example.) \n\nThus, my recommended play is to drop the block using the 0° rotation at column 2.\n\nAnswer: 2 0"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

In contrast, using the vertical orientation (90° or 270°), the falling “****” arranged vertically can descend all the way so that its bottom square lands in row10. I checked the board’s state in each column. Columns 4, 5, 8, 9, and 10 have blocks in row9 and\/or row10 so they are not safe for a vertical drop. In column 1 (as well as columns 2, 3 or 7) the slots in rows 7–10 are empty. Dropping the vertical block (using the 90° rotation) in column 1 lets the 4‑square column descend fully, placing its squares in rows 7, 8, 9, and 10.

By choosing drop coordinate 6 (so the leftmost square of the 2×2 lands in column 6) and using the 0° rotation, the falling block will drop until it lands with its bottom covering Row 9 and Row 10. Specifically, simulation shows that the piece cannot fall any lower than having its top at Row 8 (covering Row 8 and Row 9) because if it went any further, one of its cells would overlap with an occupied square in Row 10. When it lands in this position, its placement fills the two gaps in Row 9 and makes that row completely occupied:\n  Row 9 goes from \"*****..***\" to \"**********\"\nwhich will clear that row and increase the score by 1. This makes the move beneficial.\n\nThus, the move is:\n\nAnswer: 6 0","I'll choose to drop the current block rotated 90° so that its leftmost square lands in column 4. In that rotation the block looks like:\n\n Row1: **  \n Row2: *0  \n Row3: *0\n\nBy positioning the block at drop coordinate 4, the following happens when the piece falls:\n• With a 90° rotation, the block spans 2 columns and 3 rows.\n• Its top two cells (from Row1 in the block) will be placed in row 8 of the board (columns 4 and 5) and the next cell (the left one from Row2 of the block) will appear at row 9 in column 4. Then when the block falls as far as it can (without overlapping existing '*' on the board) its bottom row of the block is at row 10. In fact, when simulated, the final resting positions become:  \n – Row 8: cells (8,4) and (8,5) are filled by the top row of the falling block.  \n – Row 9: cell (9,4) is filled by the second row of the block.  \n – Row 10: cell (10,4) is filled by the block’s final cell.\n\nThis landing avoids any conflict with existing blocks on the board and does not force any part of the piece above the top boundary. (Note that possible collisions with already present blocks in row 10 for other drop coordinates prevented a full drop, so a landing with the top row at row 8 is the best valid option for this rotation.)\n\nThus my chosen move is:\n\nAnswer: 4 90","Based on the current board and block rotations I have analyzed one valid move. In this move I use the 90° rotation of the block (which gives a 3‐row by 2‐column piece with filled cells at positions (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), and (2,1)) and drop it so that its leftmost column lands at column 3. Simulating the fall from the top, the block will descend until the filled cell at (2,1) (which appears in board coordinates as one block cell in the lower part of the piece) would hit an occupied square. I found that dropping the block with its top row starting at row 5 allows all its filled cells to be placed without overlapping any existing block (“*”) and without exceeding the board’s boundaries. (For clarity: the filled cells end up in board positions – row5,col3; row6,col3 and col4; row7,col4.) This move is valid according to the rules.\n\nAnswer: 3 90","I'll analyze the board and piece possibilities briefly. In the provided board there is existing stacking in the lower rows. Our goal is to drop the current Tetris block so that it lands as far down as possible (making use of the available “room” at the bottom) without causing an immediate game‐end and possibly setting up later line clears. \n\nThe current block is given with four rotations. One promising option is to use the 270° rotation. In that orientation the block’s pattern is\n\n  0*\n  0*\n  **\n\nso its filled cells (with respect to the block’s top‐left corner) are at positions (row0, col1), (row1, col1) and (row2, col0) plus (row2, col1). Because the block is 3 rows tall, the maximum legal drop is when the top of the block is in row 8 (so that its bottom reaches row 10). Choosing an appropriate drop coordinate—i.e. positioning the block horizontally so that no filled square of the falling block collides with an existing “*” on the board—is key. \n\nOne valid placement is to drop the block in its 270° rotation with the leftmost column of the block aligned with column 7. With drop coordinate 7 the block’s filled cells will land at:\n • Row8, column 8 (from cell (0,1))\n • Row9, column 8 (from cell (1,1))\n • Row10, columns 7 and 8 (from the two “**” on row 3 of the piece)\n\nA check of the board reveals that these positions are empty:\n – In row8 (which is “*..**.....”), column 8 is ‘.’\n – In row9 (“*.**.**...”), column 8 is ‘.’\n – In row10 (“**.***...*”), columns 7 and 8 are ‘.’\n\nAlso, because the piece is 3 rows tall and the bottom row of the block lands exactly on row10, this drop is as deep as possible. There is no floating piece at a higher level—and deeper placements tend to be better in Tetris, reducing gaps.\n\nThus a suitable action is to drop the piece at drop coordinate 7 with a 270° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 7 270","Based on the board’s current state and searching for a placement that avoids immediate collisions while letting the new block settle as low as possible, I have chosen the following move. In the 90° rotation the block occupies one cell on the top (at its leftmost column), one cell one row below that (again in its leftmost column), and on the third row it fills both columns. Dropping it with its leftmost column aligned with column 9 gives these final positions:\n• Row7, column9 (from the top cell of the rotated block)\n• Row8, column9 (from the middle cell)\n• Row9, columns9 and 10 (from the bottom row cells)\nA quick check shows that if the block were to fall further (which it would, if possible, under gravity) a collision would occur (for example, row10, column10 is already occupied). Thus the piece will settle exactly in the positions outlined. \n\nAnswer: 9 90","I'll choose to drop the block using its original (0°) rotation and align its leftmost column with column 3. In this configuration the block’s filled squares are placed relative to its 2×3 grid so that:\n• The top row (row: block index 0) has filled cells at positions (0,1) and (0,2) – which map to board columns 4 and 5.\n• The bottom row (block index 1) has filled cells at positions (1,0) and (1,1) – which map to board columns 3 and 4.\n\nThen, simulating its drop on the board:\n• We let the block fall until its “bottom row” lands on board row 4 (with the top row at row 3). This is the deepest placement that avoids collision since testing the lower rows shows collisions with already occupied cells.\n• This move is legal and does not immediately clear any lines but it is a safe placement.\n\nThus, my action is to drop the block at drop coordinate 3 with a 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 3 0","I have looked over the board and the given block rotations. One valid plan is to use the block in its 0° orientation. In that rotation the block’s shape is\n\n  Row0: [* 0 0]    (that is, the left‐most square is filled)\n  Row1: [* * *]\n\nIf we drop the block at column 1 (so that the block’s three‐wide footprint covers columns 1–3) it will fall as far as the board allows without overlapping an already occupied square. In this case the piece can fall down farther than if dropped farther to the right because column 1 is relatively empty until about row 8. A simulation shows that—with drop coordinate 1 and 0° rotation—the block will come to rest with its top cell in row 2 and its full footprint occupying row 2 (cell in column 1) and row 3 (cells in columns 1, 2, and 3). (For example, row 3 originally “...**.....” then becomes “***\\n**.....” in its affected portion.) This is a safe placement that does not extend above the board.\n\nThus one acceptable answer is to drop the block with its leftmost square in column 1 using rotation 0°.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","I have analyzed the board and the various rotations provided. A safe and valid move is to drop the block in its 0° rotation (the block appears as two rows with the middle column of the top row and all of the bottom row filled) so that its overall shape lands in a central gap without causing an immediate collision. Dropping it with its leftmost square aligned with column 4 yields a valid placement that avoids the top boundary.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","I decided to use the block in its 0° orientation. In that rotation the piece’s pattern is\n\n  Row1: [0, * , *]  \n  Row2: [* , * , 0]\n\nwhich means if placed with its leftmost cell in column 2 then its filled cells will fall on board cells (using the top‐left cell of the block’s bounding box as the “drop level”) as follows:\n • Cell from (0,1) → Row r, Column (2+1)=3  \n • Cell from (0,2) → Row r, Column (2+2)=4  \n • Cell from (1,0) → Row r+1, Column 2  \n • Cell from (1,1) → Row r+1, Column 3\n\nI “dropped” the block from the top. With r = 1 the cells would be:\n • Row1, Col3  \n • Row1, Col4  \n • Row2, Col2  \n • Row2, Col3\n\nLooking at the current board:\n • In Row1 (\"....*.....\") columns 3 and 4 are empty.\n • In Row2 (\"*..***....\") columns 2 and 3 are empty.\nIf we try to let the piece fall further (r = 2), one of its cells would land at Row2, Column4—but Row2, Column4 is already occupied (a “*”). Thus the block must come to rest with its top row at r = 1.\n\nThis move is legal and safe (it doesn’t extend above the top) and does not cause an immediate line clear but it is a valid drop move. Therefore my action is to drop at column 2 (so that the block’s leftmost square is over column 2) with 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 2 0","I'll choose to drop the block in its 0° orientation with its leftmost square landing in column 6. \n\nHere’s a brief summary of the reasoning:\n\n1. The 0° block’s pattern is:\n  Row0: [*, *, 0]\n  Row1: [0, *, *]\n  It occupies 3 columns. In the leftmost column the filled cell is at the top (offset 0) while in the next two columns the lower filled cells are at offset 1.\n2. For a drop coordinate X the “landing row” R (the row where the block’s top row will rest) is determined by the highest obstacles in each column. In particular, for column X (with local offset 0) we have R = (surface at col X) – 1, while for columns X+1 and X+2 (with offset 1) we must have R = (surface at that column) – 2. (The “surface” is defined as the row index of the first fixed square in that column.)\n3. Examining the board’s columns we found:\n  • Column 6’s surface is row2  → candidate R = 2–1 = 1.\n  • Column 7’s surface is row8  → candidate R = 8–2 = 6.\n  • Column 8’s surface is row6  → candidate R = 6–2 = 4.\n  Thus, R becomes the minimum of these: R = 1.\n4. This yields a final placement where the block’s cells go to:\n  • Row1, col6 and col7\n  • Row2, col7 and col8\n—all landing in empty spots on the board.\n5. This placement is valid and does not force the block above the top boundary.\n\nTherefore, the chosen move is:\n\nAnswer: 6 0","I'll analyze the situation briefly. The board currently shows that row2 (the second line) is nearly complete:\n  Row2: ********..\n  (it has 8 filled squares and columns 9–10 are empty).\n\nLooking at our two available rotations (0°\/180° are identical, and 90°\/270° are identical), the 0° rotation gives a block shaped over a 2×3 grid with filled positions at:\n  • Top row: columns 1 and 2\n  • Bottom row: columns 2 and 3\n\nIn our “drop” notation the provided coordinate is the board column where the leftmost square of the block’s bounding box will land. If we choose drop coordinate = 8 for the 0° rotation, the block cells will eventually be placed (after falling) as follows:\n  – Top row of the block: will occupy board columns 8 and 9.\n  – Bottom row of the block: will occupy board columns 9 and 10.\n\nNow, notice that row2 of the board is currently “********..” (columns 1–8 are filled, with columns 9 and 10 empty). When the block’s bottom row fills columns 9 and 10 there, row2 becomes “**********” (a complete row). This causes an automatic row clear and increases the score by 1.\n\nSimulating the fall:\n• If we drop the block with drop coordinate 8 in 0° rotation, it falls as far as possible. It cannot go lower than a placement where its top row lands at row1 (so that the bottom row lands on row2) because dropping one row further would have the block’s top row try to occupy row2 where column8 is already filled. Thus the final resting position is:\n  – Block top row at board row1: occupies columns 8 and 9.\n  – Block bottom row at board row2: occupies columns 9 and 10.\nThis achieves the desired row2 fill and clear.\n\nThus my chosen action is to drop the block with its leftmost square at column 8 in rotation 0°.\n\nAnswer: 8 0","","Based on a preliminary analysis of the board‐layout and the four possible rotations of the falling tetromino, one promising idea was to use the 0° orientation. In that rotation the block’s occupied squares are\n\n  Row0: [* 0 0]  and  Row1: [* * *]\n\nso that when dropped its “bottom row” adds three contiguous filled squares. By “sliding” the block far to the left (that is, choosing a drop coordinate of 1 for the leftmost cell) we found that the piece is able to drop almost fully down – with its top cell landing in row 6 so that its extra row ends up at row 7. Other rotations or lateral placements forced the piece to “land” with a higher (less advanced) vertical position or in positions where part of the block would overlap an already occupied cell.\n\nThus one acceptable (and in our brief look, quite optimal) move is to drop the block at column 1 using the 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 1 0"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

One promising option was to take the 90°‐rotated block:\n  \n• In the 90° configuration the piece’s shape (using 0‑based relative coordinates) is:  \n  (0,0), (0,1)  \n  (1,0)  \n  (2,0)  \n    \nIts bounding box is 2 columns wide and 3 rows tall. When we “drop” it, we specify the board column (1‑indexed) at which the leftmost column of this piece will be aligned; valid drop columns go from 1 up to 9.  \n\nI found that dropping the 90° block so that its leftmost column is column 7 (i.e. “Answer: 7 90”) lets it fall safely. In that placement the block’s cells will end up at board coordinates (using 0‑based row\/column indices):  \n – (7,6) and (7,7) from the top row of the block,  \n – (8,6) from the second row,  \n – and (9,6) from the third row.  \n\nNone of these collide with existing pieces (note that row 8 at col6 and row 9 at col6 are empty). Although this move does not immediately clear a line, it avoids collision with the current structure and maintains a safe field.\n\nAnswer: 7 90","I'll choose to deploy the block in its vertical orientation (rotation 90°) in column 1. In this configuration the block falls in column 1 and lands as high as possible without colliding, filling cells in rows 5, 6, 7, and 8 (with its bottom cell landing in row 8 because row 9 is already occupied in that column). Notice that row 8 was almost complete already (it originally had only the first and last cells empty). Filling the column‑1 gap turns row 8 into a nearly full line (“*********.”), setting up the board for a future clearance when the missing square is eventually filled. This play maximizes our chances for a future row clear and avoids any immediate collisions.\n\nAnswer: 1 90","Evaluating the board, we note that each column already has a “floor” where the falling 2×2 (square) block will come to rest. For any drop coordinate d (which indicates the leftmost column covered by the block), we determine for both columns d and d+1 the first row that already contains a block. (If there is no block in that column, we use row 11 as a virtual obstacle because the board has 10 rows.) In our current board the “obstacle” rows are:\n • Column 1: row 6\n • Column 2: row 9\n • Column 3: row 9\n • Column 4: row 9\n • Column 5: row 9\n • Column 6: row 9\n • Column 7: row 8\n • Column 8: row 8\n • Column 9: row 9\n • Column 10: row 10\n\nWhen placing a 2×2 block in columns d and d+1 the block will “land” so its top row is given by:\n  min(obstacle_row[d], obstacle_row[d+1]) – 2\n\nFor example:\n • If we drop with d = 1, then min(6, 9) = 6 so the block’s top row will be 6 – 2 = 4. (It would occupy rows 4 and 5 in columns 1 and 2.)\n • If we drop with d = 2, then min(9, 9) = 9 so the top row becomes 9 – 2 = 7. (It would occupy rows 7 and 8 in columns 2 and 3.)\n • Likewise, evaluating other d’s we see that d = 2 (or 3, 4, 5, or 9) gives the block the lowest landing (its top row being 7 and the bottom row 8), which is preferable because it doesn’t raise the stacking unnecessarily.\n\nSince the problem permits any valid action and all rotations for the square remain identical, a safe and effective choice is to drop the block in columns 2–3 in its 0° orientation.\n\nAnswer: 2 0","I'll analyze the board first. (Rows are numbered 1 at the top to 10 at the bottom.)\n\nCurrent board:\n Row1–Row5: all empty.\n Row6: *.........    (only col1 occupied)\n Row7: ***.......    (cols 1–3 occupied)\n Row8: ***...**..    (cols 1–3 and 7–8 occupied)\n Row9: *********.    (cols 1–9 occupied; col10 empty)\n Row10: **...**.**    (occupied in cols 1–2, 6–7, 9–10)\n\nThe current block has two distinct shapes (0°\/180° and 90°\/270°). In the 0° orientation the block is a 2×3 shape with filled cells at:\n Top row: positions 1 and 2.\n Bottom row: positions 2 and 3.\nWhen “dropped” with drop_coordinate L it will occupy board columns L, L+1, L+2; its top row will be at some row R, and its bottom row at R+1. For example, if we want to avoid interfering with the blocks already on the board, we have to choose L and let gravity settle the piece so that none of its filled cells overlap a star.\n\nI considered several placements. One idea was trying to fill the gap in row9 (missing col10) by a placement that would put one block square in row9 col10. For a 0° piece that would require having the bottom‐right cell (offset (1,2)) land in (9,10) – this forces drop_coordinate = 8 and landing with top row R = 8. However, checking row8 (the top row of the falling piece) with a square at (8,8) shows a collision (since row8 col8 is already occupied). Other rotations running into similar issues.\n\nA straightforward safe action is to use the 0° rotation with a drop_coordinate that avoids overlap with existing blocks. For example, if we choose drop_coordinate = 2 with the 0° block, then the piece (cells at offsets (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2)) will eventually land as far as possible. A simulation shows that starting from the top it can fall until its top cell is row5; if it falls one row further (placing its bottom row at row7), one cell (at row7, col? – specifically the cell at (7,3) from offset (1,1)) would hit a star (since row7’s first three columns are occupied). Thus it will land with top row R = 5 and bottom row R+1 = 6, placing block cells at:\n • (5,2) and (5,3)\n • (6,3) and (6,4)\nNo collisions occur, ensuring the move is legal.\n\nThus I choose the safe move: drop_coordinate 2 and rotation 0.\n\nAnswer: 2 0","I'll choose to drop the 2×2 block with its 0° rotation (it’s symmetric anyway) so that its leftmost square lands in column 5. This placement (drop coordinate 5 with 0° rotation) lets the 2×2 block fall as far as possible without colliding, landing with its bottom row on row 8 and its top row on row 7.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","Using the 90° rotation for the current block appears to let it land safely without collision. In this rotation the block’s shape is\n\n  Row0: *0  \n  Row1: *0  \n  Row2: **\n\nWhen we drop it with its leftmost column aligned at board column 9 the block occupies board cells as follows:\n\n• The first star (Row0, Column0) goes to Row6, Column9  \n• The next star (Row1, Column0) goes to Row7, Column9  \n• The bottom row’s first star (Row2, Column0) goes to Row8, Column9 and the second star (Row2, Column1) goes to Row8, Column10\n\nA brief check of those cells in the existing board – where row numbering runs from 1 (top) to 10 (bottom) – shows they are empty. Also, if the block were allowed to drop one more row (i.e. with its top row on Row7), the star that would land in Row9, Column9 (which already contains a block) makes that impossible. Hence the block comes to rest at the configuration described.\n\nThus, the recommended move is to drop the block at coordinate 9 with a 90° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 9 90","Based on my analysis I can make a valid move by dropping the block in its horizontal (0°) configuration with its leftmost square in column 1. In that configuration the block is a row of four squares. When dropped at drop_coordinate = 1 (so that it will cover columns 1–4) it will fall until one further downward move would result in one of its cells landing on an already occupied square. In this board the first collision happens when trying to go from row 4 to row 5 (because row 5 already has blocks in columns 2 and 3). Therefore the block will lock in row 4 (covering columns 1, 2, 3, and 4). This move is a legal placement, and while it does not clear any row immediately, it is a valid action that satisfies the game rules.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","I’ve worked through the board and the current block’s rotations and found a legal drop that avoids immediate collisions and “locks” the piece onto the board. In particular, using the 90° rotation of the block (with shape\n\n  *0\n  *0\n  **\n\nso that its filled squares (relative to the top‐left of its bounding box) are at positions (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) and (2,1)) and dropping it so that the leftmost column of the piece is aligned with board column 9 yields a valid landing. In that placement the piece will fall until it comes to rest (its downward movement being blocked by an occupied square below one of its filled cells). (A brief simulation shows that if we label the top row of the falling piece as row R then eventually R = 3 so that the block’s squares end up at board positions (3,9), (4,9) and (5,9)-(5,10). Moving one step further down would run into an obstacle on row 6 so the drop stops safely.)\n\nThus, the action I recommend is:\n\nAnswer: 9 90","I recommend dropping the block as a horizontal piece (using the 0° rotation) at column 1. In that case the four‐cell “****” will fall until row 4 (where occupied squares would block further descent) and thus come to rest on row 3. This placement is safe and does not push any cell past the top border.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","I’ve analyzed the board and the block’s rotations and chosen a safe move that avoids any immediate collision. I opted to use the unrotated “0°” shape, which is\n\n  Row1: [0,*,0]\n  Row2: [*,*,*]\n\nand drop it with its leftmost square in column 1. In this placement the falling block will come to rest in the top two rows (row1 and row2) because attempting to lower it further would make its fully‐filled bottom row conflict with an already occupied cell in row3. This move is legal and safe given the current board state.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","Based on analyzing the board and each block rotation’s “footprint” when dropped, one promising option is to use the 180° orientation. In that rotation the block’s shape is\n\n  Row0: ***      (occupies three consecutive columns)\n  Row1: ..*      (occupies only the rightmost column of that three‐column span)\n\nBy choosing the drop coordinate as 6 the block (when horizontally aligned so that its leftmost square is in column 6) covers columns 6–8 on its top row and adds a square in column 8 on its bottom row. A brief simulation from the bottom up shows that if we try to drop it any lower the block collides (for example, at r = 7 the top row would overlap an already occupied cell). However with drop coordinate 6 in 180° rotation the block will descend as far as it can (landing with its top row in board row 6 and its bottom row in row 7) without overlapping any '*' on the board. This move avoids an immediate game‐over and is a sound, legal placement.\n\nAnswer: 6 180","I analyzed the board’s right‐side columns and looked for a placement with minimal interference. In the 270° rotation the current block looks like:\n\n Row1: “**”\n Row2: “0*”\n Row3: “0*”\n\nThis form is 2 squares wide. Choosing a drop coordinate of 9 (so that the leftmost block cell lands in column 9) means the block will occupy columns 9 and 10. When the block falls, it will settle as far as it can go without colliding with filled squares. A careful check shows that if the block falls with its top row landing at row 2, its filled cells land in:\n • Row2: columns 9 and 10,\n • Row3: column 10,\n • Row4: column 10.\nLooking at the board:\n – In row2 (“***.......”) both columns 9 and 10 are empty.\n – In row3 (“****....*.”) column 10 is empty (even though column 9 already has a star, the block’s filled square does not try to fill column 9 in that row).\n – In row4 (“****....*.”) column 10 is also empty.\nThus the placement is legal, does not cause collisions, and avoids triggering a game‐over condition.\n\nAnswer: 9 270","I'll choose to drop the block in its horizontal form (rotation 0°) with its left‐most square in column 4. In that position the 4‐cell horizontal block will start falling from the top. It will first pass through row 1 (where columns 4–7 are empty) and then safely land on row 2 because row 3 already has an obstacle in column 4. Hence, the move “drop at column 4 with no rotation (0°)” is valid.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","I analyzed the board and the available rotations of the falling block. One sensible idea is to let the block fall using its 0° rotation. In this orientation the block’s filled cells appear as a little “L‐shape” (with three cells in its lower row and one cell offset in the row above) so that when dropped with its leftmost filled square positioned in column 3 it can “slide” into a low gap without causing an overlap high on the board. (There are other placements that might also work well, but this move appears safe and could even help clear a nearly‐filled row.) \n\nAnswer: 3 0"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

In its 0° rotation, the block occupies 3 columns and 2 rows. With the leftmost coordinate set at 4, the block will cover columns 4, 5, and 6. Since the board is empty and there’s no obstruction, this move is valid. I choose the 0° rotation and drop the block so that the leftmost square is in column 4.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","After reviewing the board and the available rotations for the block, I decided to use the horizontal 0° rotation (which is the same as the 180° rotation) so that the four‐cell piece (represented by “****”) will drop as far down without colliding with any already–placed blocks. For example, if you choose drop_coordinate 6 in the 0° rotation then the piece will occupy columns 6, 7, 8, and 9 at the bottom row (row 10). Here’s why that move works:\n\n• In 0° orientation the block is 4 cells long. If you drop it with its leftmost cell in column 6 it will cover columns 6–9.\n• Looking at row 10 (the bottom row), columns 6–9 are empty. (Note that row 10 already contains a block in columns 4 and 5, so if you had placed the piece further left, parts of it would have collided with those blocks).\n• Since the cells under columns 6–9 in row 10 are clear and row 10 is the bottom, the block will come to rest there.\n• The move is legal because none of the current board squares where the block lands are already occupied.\n\nThus, the valid and safe action is to drop the horizontal block with its leftmost cell in column 6, using 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 6 0","Based on the current board configuration and our simulation, one valid move is to use the 0° rotation (with block shape:\n\n  0°:\n   0**\n   **0\n\nso that the block’s occupied cells are (0,1), (0,2), (1,0) and (1,1) relative to its 2×3 bounding box) and to drop it so that its leftmost column is column 2. In that placement the block “falls” as far as possible – its lower cells exactly reach row 10 without causing any collisions with the already–placed blocks. (To explain briefly, using drop coordinate 2 means the block’s bounding box covers columns 2–4. With the 0° arrangement, the occupied cells then are at board positions (r, 3) and (r,4) in the top row of the block and at (r+1, 2) and (r+1, 3) in the next row. A simulation shows that the piece can fall until r = 9, so that the lower block cells end up in row 10; any further descent would “drop” part of the shape off the bottom of the board.) \n\nThus the move “Answer: 2 0” is legal and safe. \n\nAnswer: 2 0","Based on an analysis of the board and available rotations, one safe placement is to use the 0° rotation (with the block pattern having the lone block at its top‐right and three blocks along its bottom) and drop it with its leftmost column aligned with column 1. In that case the falling block’s bottom row will land on row 8 (just above the filled squares already emerging in row 9 and 10) and its top row on row 7. This placement avoids any collisions on the board while not topping out and does not cause a row clear—which is acceptable given the situation. \n\nAnswer: 1 0","I analyzed the board and found that—for example—a very good move is to use the 90° rotated version of the falling block (which is a vertical “stick”) and drop it in the 10th column. In this configuration the block will fall all the way to the bottom (since column 10 is clear) and occupy rows 7–10. (Recall that for vertical blocks the drop coordinate indicates the single column in which the block falls, and for a 90° rotation the block appears as four squares in one column.) Although no complete row is cleared immediately, this move is valid and positions the piece low on the board.\n\nAnswer: 10 90","I'll choose to use the 0° rotation. In this rotation the block is represented as:\n  Row1: 0 * 0  (only the middle cell is filled)\n  Row2: * * *  (all three cells are filled)\nWhen you drop this block, the board will be filled using the filled parts with the convention that the left‐most block cell in the shape is aligned with the chosen drop coordinate.\n\nI decided on drop coordinate 7 with 0° rotation. In the final landing position (with the block falling until its lower row reaches the bottom of the board), the block’s bottom row (***) will occupy board columns 7, 8, 9 on row 10, and its upper single filled cell (at the center of the pattern) will occupy column 8 on row 9. Checking against the board:\n\n• Row 9 (before placement “..****...*”) has a gap at column 8.\n• Row 10 (before placement “.****....*”) has gaps at columns 7, 8, and 9.\n\nThus, the piece will drop without colliding and lands safely. (No full row is cleared, but it is a legal move.)\n\nAnswer: 7 0","I'll drop the 2×2 block with its 0° rotation so that its leftmost square lands in column 4. In that configuration the block will fall until its bottom is immediately above row 9 (because row 9 already has blocks in columns 4 and 5), which means it will come to rest covering rows 7 and 8 and columns 4 and 5. That placement fills the two empty cells in row 8 (making row 8 completely occupied), thus clearing row 8 and scoring 1 point.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","I'll choose to drop the block in its unrotated (0°) orientation with the left‐most square landing in column 1. In doing so the block (with shape\n\n  Row1: [*, *]  \n  Row2: [ , *, *]\n\nwhen aligned so its leftmost cell is in column 1) will fall until its lower row reaches row 7 (its cells would be at row 6 and row 7) without colliding with any existing blocks. (A quick simulation shows that if we let it fall further the block’s second row would try to occupy a filled position on row 8.) This is a valid placement that lets the game continue.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","I analyzed the board and the available rotations for the T‐shaped piece. In its 0° configuration the shape is\n\n  Row1: 0 * 0  \n  Row2: * * *\n\nwhere the “0” cells are “holes” and the “*” cells are part of the tetromino. If you “drop” the piece with its leftmost column aligned with board column 3, then the bottom row of the piece (covering board columns 3–5) will come to rest just above any already–placed blocks. Checking the board’s “stack” in columns 3, 4, and 5 shows that the lowest unobstructed landing position has those cells in row 6 (because column 3 already has a block in row 7 while columns 4 and 5 would otherwise permit a lower drop, the piece cannot go lower than row 6 without causing a collision). The top cell of the piece (in the 0° pattern at the center) lands in row 5, and it fits cleanly without overlapping existing blocks. Although this placement does not clear a row immediately, it is valid and follows the rules.\n\nThus, the advised move is to drop the piece with its leftmost square in column 3 and leave it in the 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 3 0","I'll choose a simple, safe move that avoids any collisions. In the 0° rotation the falling piece’s shape is:\n\n  Row1: [*, 0, 0] → meaning it occupies only the first column\n  Row2: [*, *, *] → meaning it occupies three contiguous columns\n\nIf we drop this piece with its leftmost square in column 1, here’s what happens:\n• The piece falls until its bottom row (the three‐block row) lands just above an existing block.\n• Looking at column 1, the first collision occurs when row 6 (“*****.....”) already has a block at column 1.\n• Thus the piece settles with its bottom row occupying row 5 (columns 1–3) and the top row occupying row 4 (with column 1 filled).\n• There’s no collision in row 4 (which is empty) and in row 5 the only already filled cell is in column 4.\n• This yields a legal, safe placement without causing the game to end.\n\nSo the chosen action is to drop with leftmost coordinate 1 and no rotation (0°).\n\nAnswer: 1 0","I analyzed the board and the four rotation possibilities for the block. In rotation 180 the block occupies the top row completely (3 blocks) and a single block centered in the bottom row. This rotation gives a fairly “flat” piece. By choosing the left‐most drop coordinate as 3, the block covers columns 3–5, and as it drops it lands just above the row5 blocks (which already have stars in columns 1–4) so that no collision occurs and the piece comes to rest in rows 3 and 4. In this placement the upper row of the block (covering columns 3 to 5) is placed into an empty row and the lower part sits safely on row4 (which already has a star in column 1 but is empty at column 4). This avoids an early game over and does not cause any unintended overlap. \n\nThus, my chosen move is to drop the piece at column 3 with a 180° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 3 180","Based on the board layout and the positions of obstacles, one promising approach is to “park” the piece on the right side where the obstacles are lower so that the block lands deeply into the stack rather than “floating” high. In this option a rotation of 180° looks ideal because its flat “***” top row and the single square “00*” beneath in the right‐most column allow the piece to fill in a gap on the right while avoiding collision with an already occupied square.\n\nFor instance, if we use the 180° rotation the shape is\n\n  Row0: ***  \n  Row1: 00*\n\nand then choose a drop coordinate of 7 – meaning that the leftmost block square (of the 3‐wide shape) falls in column 7. In the simulation the following happens:\n\n• With drop coordinate 7 the piece covers board columns 7–9 in its top row (row0) and – because of the “00*” in row1 – places a single block at column 9 in the row just below.  \n• Checking column by column:  \n – In board column 7 the lowest filled part of the falling shape is in row0; the first obstacle comes in row8 so the piece can drop until its top row becomes row7.  \n – In board column 8 the situation is similar.  \n – In board column 9 the lowest part is in row1; since an obstacle exists at row8 the piece settles when the top row is row6 (so the lowest cell reaches row7).  \n• There is no overlap with already placed blocks (for example row7 already has a block in column 8 but—because of our shape and drop position—that square is not used by the falling block).  \n\nThus the final placement would have the 180° rotated block with its left edge in column 7; it lands low onto the board—and it avoids an immediate collision. This is a safe and viable move given the current state.\n\nAnswer: 7 180","I'll choose to drop the piece in its 90° state so that its two‐column shape lands safely on columns 9–10. In this rotation the block’s occupied cells are\n\n  Row1: *\n  Row2: *\n  Row3: **\n\nWhen dropping with the leftmost square placed in column 9 the block’s column mapping is as follows:\n • The block’s first column falls into board column 9.\n • The block’s second column falls into board column 10.\n\nSimulating the fall, the most downward “safe” landing is reached when the bottom row of the block (which occupies row (base + 2)) comes to rest just above an obstruction in column 9 (where an occupied cell appears by row 6) and in column 10 (with the first blocked cell by row 8). Working through these restrictions shows that the block lands with its top row at board row 3 (so that row 3–5 host the block cells). This drop does not cause any overlap and is a legal move.\n\nThus, the chosen action is:\n\nAnswer: 9 90","I'll choose to use the vertical orientation (rotated 90°) in the 6th column. In this board the “I‐piece” in horizontal (0°\/180°) mode would cover four consecutive columns – but almost every 4‐cell span includes columns already occupied very high on the board (for example, columns 3–5 already have blocks in row 3), forcing the piece to land high (around row 2). By contrast, dropping the vertically oriented block in column 6 lets it fall much lower – the first obstruction in column 6 is not until row 9, so the piece comes to rest with its bottom cell in row 8 (occupying rows 5–8). Even though no immediate line clear occurs, as a skilled player I know that landing as low as possible is important for keeping options open and preventing early topping out.\n\nThus, the move is to drop with leftmost coordinate 6 using the 90° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 6 90","Based on the board’s current state, I noticed that many of the lower rows are already almost filled. For example, row6 is missing only the 10th column; however, using a horizontal “I” (which occupies four contiguous squares) will force an early stop because several of the lower rows already have obstacles (for instance, row3 has stars in columns 3–5 and 9, so any horizontal drop will be stopped very high). On the other hand, if we use the vertical orientation the piece will fall in one column only and may be able to drop further before one of its squares “hits” an already‐occupied square.\n\nI examined each column to see how far a vertical drop would go. In brief, viewing from the top the first filled cell in each column forces the falling “I” block to come to rest with its bottom just one row above that obstacle. (Recall that if part of a newly placed block would finish “above” the board the game is over.) For columns 2, 6, and 10 the first obstacle appears in row5 so the vertical “I” would come to rest with its cells in rows 1–4. However, in columns 7 and 8 the first filled cell occurs a bit lower (in row6), which means the vertical block—by falling further—would land with its bottom in row5 (and occupy rows 2–5). Thus choosing one of these columns lets the block land lower on the board which is generally preferable.\n\nI therefore choose to drop the block in vertical orientation in column 7. (Rotating by 90° gives a vertical line identical to the 270° option.) This means the leftmost (and only) square (since it is one column wide) will be in column 7.\n\nAnswer: 7 90","I'll explain my reasoning briefly, then give my final answer.\n\nI examined the board and the available rotations (0°\/180° give a horizontal “line” of four squares and 90°\/270° give a vertical “line”). One safe, effective option is to drop the horizontal line without further rotation (i.e. 0°) with its leftmost square placed in column 1. In this drop the block falls until one of its four cells is forced to stop because a block is already present below. Looking along the four columns 1–4 of the board, we see the highest obstacle is in column 3 (obstacle in row 3) so that the drop will end with the block locking in row 2 (its lowest row, row 2, is determined by the most restrictive column). This move causes no game‐over (all four squares of the block are safely on the board) and is a legal move according to the rules.\n\nFinal answer in the required format is:  \nAnswer: 1 0","I'll use the simple 0° rotation shape. In 0° the block’s occupied squares (relative to its local top‐left corner) are at positions (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), and (2,2). If we choose the drop coordinate 5 then the block will cover board columns 5–7. Dropping the block with its top row at board row 1 gives:\n\n• Row1: the block occupies columns 6 and 7.\n• Row2: the block occupies columns 5 and 6.\n\nWe then let the block fall. Trying to slide it one row down (i.e. block’s top at row2) would put its square at row2, column7 into a cell already occupied on row2 (since row2 “****..*...” has a star at column7). Therefore the block stays at row1 and row2, which is a legal placement (and does not exceed the top boundary).\n\nIn the required output format our move is:\n\nAnswer: 5 0","Based on the board, one promising option is to drop the 2×2 square in the leftmost columns so that it fills a nearly complete row. In this case, note that row8 has its first two cells empty (“..********”), and every other cell is already filled. By dropping the block with its left edge in column 1 (and using the 0° rotation which is identical to all rotations for a square), the block’s top row will come to rest on row8 and the bottom row on row9. This placement fills row8 completely (all ten cells become occupied) and thus will trigger a line clear and raise the score.\n\nTherefore, the chosen action is to drop the block with leftmost coordinate 1 and with 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 1 0"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Placing the block at column4 with 0° rotation will result in the block occupying row10, columns4–7 and leaving no overlap with existing blocks.

One good idea is to drop it so that the block’s bottom row (all three squares) fits into row10 to complete that row; that is, we want to fill the three remaining empty squares in row10. Choosing the drop coordinate 8 (which means the leftmost square of the block lands in column 8) positions the block’s columns at 8, 9, and 10.\n\nWhen the block falls:\n• In the final landing, the block’s top row will be positioned at row9 and its bottom row at row10.\n• For the 0° rotation, the only filled cell in the top row is the middle one—at board column 9—and the bottom row fills columns 8, 9, and 10.\n• This placement does not result in any collision with the already placed blocks (row9 already has a ‘*’ in column 1, and row10 already has stars in columns 1–7).\n• Once the block lands, row10 becomes completely filled (\"**********\") and clears automatically, increasing the score by 1.\n\nThus, the optimal move is to drop the block at column 8 using the 0° orientation.\n\nAnswer: 8 0","By simulating the drop of a 2×2 square block, we can pick any leftmost column between 1 and 9. However, dropping it so that it falls unobstructed is important. Since row 10 already has obstacles in columns 1 and 9, choosing place 2 allows the block (which has the same shape no matter its rotation) to fall so that its bottom row lands on row 10 (filling columns 2 and 3) and its top row lands on row 9. This avoids any immediate collision issues and is a safe move. With the block’s shape being a square, using a 0° rotation is a valid option.\n\nAnswer: 2 0","I'll choose to rotate the block in its 0° orientation and drop it so that the leftmost square lands in column 4. In the 0° configuration the block looks like this: \n\n  Row1: 0  0  *\n  Row2: *  *  *\n\nWhen dropped from the top with its left edge at column 4 the block will fall until its bottom row lands on row 10. At that point the block’s squares will occupy row9 at column 6 and row10 at columns 4, 5, and 6. Checking the board:\n\n• In row 9 the only current filled positions are columns 2 and 3, so column 6 is free.\n• In row 10 the already filled positions are columns 1, 2, 3, and 9, leaving columns 4–6 free.\n\nThus, no collision occurs and the move is legal. Also, note that even though no row gets filled completely in this move, it is a safe and valid placement.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","The board already has blocks in rows 9 and 10. One simple valid play is to use the current block in its 0° (horizontal) rotation. In this orientation the block “****” is 4 cells wide. If we drop it with its leftmost square in column 1, the piece will fall until its next drop would cause at least one of its 4 cells (at columns 1–4) to overlap the already occupied cells in row 9. This means the piece will come to rest with its entire row at row 8 (which is completely empty) without any collision, making it a valid move.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","Using the 0° rotation the block’s “filled” cells (using a 0-index for the block grid) come at positions (0,1), (0,2), (1,0) and (1,1) (where row0 is the block’s top row and column0 is its leftmost column). When we choose a drop coordinate of 3, this means when the block is dropped, its “grid” is aligned so that its leftmost column falls at the board’s column 3. In this configuration the actual board‐cells that would receive the block’s marks become:\n• From the top row of the block: cells at (R, 4) and (R, 5)\n• From the bottom row of the block: cells at (R+1, 3) and (R+1, 4)\nIf we simulate the drop:\n• Placing the block as far down as possible, we find that dropping it too far (for example with its top row at row 7) would put one of its cells in row 8 where row 8 already holds “****......” (columns 1–4 are already filled) and result in a collision.\n• However, a placement with the block’s top row at row 6 (so that it occupies rows 6 and 7) finds no obstacles on rows 6 and 7 (both are completely empty). This is a legal landing position and does not result in the block exceeding the board’s top.\nThus choosing drop coordinate 3 with rotation 0 is a valid play under the given rules.\n\nAnswer: 3 0","Based on the board’s current configuration and the available rotations of the falling tetromino, I recommend dropping the block in its 0° orientation so that its three‐cell row (the lower row “***”) lands in columns 8–10. In our simulation the limiting column is column 9 (which already has a block in row 10), so when we drop it with its leftmost cell in column 8 the falling block will come to rest with its top row in row 8 and second row in row 9. This avoids any premature “game over” (by not exceeding the top of the board) and sets up a relatively stable field.\n\nAnswer: 8 0","I have analyzed the board and determined a safe move. In this situation the currently falling 2×2 block (which is the same regardless of its rotation) can be dropped with its left‐most column in column 1 (i.e. drop coordinate 1) and no rotation (0°). When dropped there the block will fall to land in rows 6 and 7, avoiding any collisions with already placed blocks.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","Based on my analysis I recommend placing the block using the 90° rotation with its leftmost square in column 6. In that orientation the block’s filled cells will fall into safe, open spots without immediately colliding, and they will land as far down as possible. (For details: In the 90° rotation the pattern is a 3‑row by 2‑column piece with filled cells at the upper left, both cells of the middle row, and the lower right. Dropping with its left edge in column 6 places its cells in columns 6 and 7. As the block falls, its filled cell in the middle row lands on row 8 and the cell in the bottom row lands on row 9; this placement avoids the already occupied spots and does not push any block over the top.) \n\nAnswer: 6 90","I'll choose to use the 0° rotation and drop the block with its leftmost square in column 1. In this configuration the block’s 0° shape, which has a single block in its top row (at the rightmost position) and three contiguous blocks in the bottom row, will fall safely onto the board without immediate collision. When dropped at column 1 with 0° rotation the block will descend until its bottom row lands on row 6 (just before the obstacles there) so that its top row ends up on row 5. This is a safe placement that does not cause the block to exceed the board’s boundaries. \n\nAnswer: 1 0","I'll choose to drop the block with no rotation and set its leftmost square to column 1. In 0° rotation the block’s pattern is\n\n  Row1: [blank, block, blank]  \n  Row2: [block, block, block]\n\nWhen dropping with the left edge at column 1 the falling simulation shows that the block will drop until its bottom row comes to rest immediately above an occupied cell. In our simulation this happens before the block would collide with the star in row 4 (at column 3) so that the block ends up with its top row at row 2 and its bottom row at row 3. This move is safe and legal. \n\nAnswer: 1 0","Based on studying the board’s current gaps and the falling block’s four possible rotations, a promising plan is to use the 90° rotation. In that orientation the block occupies only two columns (its cells coming in two narrow columns with an extra row having a double‐cell), which gives us more flexibility in later falling into a tight gap. Looking at the board’s lower half – where many rows are nearly complete – the right–central region (columns 7–8) has fewer obstacles in the landing zone. By dropping the block so that its leftmost square is in column 7 (thus having it cover columns 7 and 8 in the portions where it is “wide”), the piece can drop safely without bumping against preexisting blocks before settling at the bottom. This move is likely to build on the existing structure so as to clear lines more quickly in later rounds without risking the block exceeding the board’s top boundary.\n\nAnswer: 7 90","I'll use the following reasoning. One viable approach was to try the 90° rotation so that the “L‐like” piece (occupying cells at relative offsets (0,0), (1,0), (1,1) and (2,1)) lands in an open region. In one simulation I found, if we drop the block with the leftmost cell beginning in column 4 (i.e. “Answer: 4 90”) then using gravity the block “falls” until it lands as soon as the next move would have one of its cells hit an occupied square. In this case the landing positions become: \n • one cell placed at (row3, col4), \n • two cells placed at (row4, cols4–5), and \n • one cell at (row5, col5). \nA check against the current board shows that these landing positions are empty and that if the block were moved one row lower a collision would occur. (No row is thereby completely filled and no immediate game‐over is caused.) \n\nThus one acceptable action is to drop with leftmost coordinate 4 and use a 90° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 4 90","I’ve chosen a move that places the block using its 0° rotation so that the left‐most column of the block lands in column 5. In this rotation the block’s pattern is\n\n  Row0: [* 0 0]    (where only the left square is filled)\n  Row1: [* * *]    (the whole row is filled)\n\nWhen you drop it at column 5 it will “fall” so that its Row1 occupies row3 of the board (and its Row0 occupies row2), and none of its filled squares overlap an already occupied square on the board. (A quick check shows that row2 has an empty square at column 5 and row3 is “****......”, so adding stars at columns 5, 6 and 7 is safe.) \n\nThus, the action “drop at column 5 with 0° rotation” is a valid move.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","I'll analyze the board and the four rotations briefly. One promising option is to use the 180° rotation. In this rotation the block “looks” like\n\n  Row1: ***  \n  Row2: *00  \n\nso that its top row is a continuous string of three squares and the second row has a block only at its “left‐edge.” If we choose the drop so that the “leftmost square” lands in column 8, then the block’s three‐cell row will occupy board columns 8–10. (Note that “drop_coordinate” means that the block’s grid column 1 goes to that board column.) A simulation shows that, once dropped at column 8 in the 180° rotation, the piece will fall until it comes to rest on a higher obstacle (its lower cell colliding with an existing star) and will merge into the board without exceeding the top. Although this move does not clear a row immediately, it neatly fills a gap on the right side and keeps the board “compact” for future line clears.\n\nThus, my chosen action is to drop the block with its 180° rotation at column 8.\n\nAnswer: 8 180","I analyzed the board and noticed that row 3 (“*******...”) is almost complete—it has stars in columns 1–7 and is missing stars in columns 8–10. That means if we can drop a block so that it “covers” exactly columns 8, 9, and 10 in one of its rows, we would complete that row and trigger a line clear (thus increasing the score).\n\nLooking at the provided rotations the 180° version of the current block looks promising. In the 180° rotation the block appears as:\n\n  Row1:  ***  \n  Row2:  00*\n\nInterpreting the “0” as an empty cell, the block’s cells occupy:\n • In its top row: the leftmost cell (position 0), the next cell (position 1), and the third cell (position 2).\n • In its second row: only the third cell (position 2).\n\nIf we choose to drop the block with its leftmost square in column 8 (so that when placed the top row covers columns 8, 9, and 10) then:\n\n• The top row of the block (cells at positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)) will land in row 3 as columns 8, 9, and 10.\n  – Row 3 is “*******...” where columns 1–7 are ‘*’ and 8–10 are empty.\n  – Filling columns 8–10 completes the row (it becomes “**********”), which then clears.\n• The second row’s cell (offset (1,2)) will land in row 4 as column 10.\n  – Row 4 (“..***.....”) has no conflict at column 10.\n\nFor a dropping column = 8 with this 180° rotation the falling block’s cells “fall” as far as possible until one of its cells meets an already occupied cell or the bottom. A column–by–column check shows:\n – In column 8 the lone block cell (relative offset (0,0)) can fall as far as row 4 because row 5 already has a star in column 8.\n – In column 9 the block cell (relative (0,1)) similarly can fall no lower than row 4.\n – In column 10 two cells occupy that column: the top one (relative (0,2)) can fall to row 4, but the one from the second row (relative (1,2)) then ends up at row 5. Actually, however, if the block were to fall one step further, the bottom cell would overlap an occupied cell (since row 5 column 10 is filled), so the block “locks” one row higher. A careful per–column calculation shows the highest drop that does not overlap is reached when the top row of the block is placed in row 3.\nThus the final placement is:\n – Block’s top row occupies row 3, columns 8, 9, 10.\n – Block’s second row occupies row 4, column 10.\nThis placement is legal and yields a cleared row (row 3).\n\nTherefore the move is to drop with leftmost column 8 and to use the 180° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 8 180","After examining the board and the falling block’s possible rotations, one promising play is to use the block in its 0° rotation (with the two‐by‐three bounding box and block cells at (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), and (1,2)) and drop it so that its leftmost column lands in board column 8. In that case, when the block falls it will “settle” with its bounding box covering columns 8–10. (Our basic simulation shows that if dropped any further the block would overlap an already occupied space, so the safest landing is achieved by dropping it so that it lands from row 2 down, rather than higher at the top; this avoids an immediate collision while keeping the board as low as possible.) \n\nThus, one correct action is to drop with leftmost coordinate 8 and no rotation. \n\nAnswer: 8 0","I analyzed the board and block rotations in detail and found that a promising drop is to use the 90° rotated block and release it so its left‐most column is column 9. In that orientation the block’s two–cell-wide shape falls so that its top row lands on row 6. One shift downward would cause the lowest square to run into a filled cell in row 9, so dropping at column 9 with a 90° rotation is a safe and legal move.\n\nAnswer: 9 90"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

In this position, as the block falls it will settle with its bottom row landing at row 10 (the board’s bottom) without overlapping any existing blocks (the only blocks on the board are in row 9–10 at columns 5 and 6). This provides a legal placement and continues the game safely.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","Based on the current board, one good strategy is to let the 4‐wide horizontal block fall so that its leftmost square is in column 7 with a 0° rotation. In that configuration the block will drop all the way to the bottom (row 10) because there is no obstruction in columns 7–10 on rows 9 and 10. Although no full row is cleared immediately, this move safely lands the block in the lowermost row without overlapping existing pieces.\n\nAnswer: 7 0","I analyzed the board and concluded that with the current 2×2 (square) block—which looks exactly the same no matter how it’s rotated—the key decision is where horizontally to drop it. Examining the bottom rows reveals that some positions (like trying to land the block on the bottom row rows 9–10) would result in a collision with already‐occupied cells. For example, dropping with its leftmost square in column 3 would have the block fall too far (attempting to occupy rows 9–10 in columns 3–4) but row 9 already has a block in column 3. Other candidate horizontal positions yield the best valid landing position (with the block stopping one row earlier): a placement where the block will come to rest in rows 8 and 9. One such move is to drop the block with its leftmost square in column 7.\n\nSince the block is square, you can use any rotation and the simplest is 0°. So the chosen move is dropping with leftmost column 7 and rotation 0°.\n\nAnswer: 7 0","I examined the board and the four possible rotations of the current block. (Recall that the block “0°” looks like this:\n\n  **0  \n  0**\n\nwith filled squares at positions (row0,col0), (row0,col1), (row1,col1) and (row1,col2), while the “90°” version is\n\n  0*  \n  **  \n  *0\n\nwhich is equivalent to the 270° state, and note that 180° is the same as 0°.)\n\nOne viable plan was to use the 0° rotation so that the block’s 2‑row shape lands in the lower part of the board without colliding. For example, by specifying a drop coordinate of 7 (meaning that the leftmost of the block’s three columns aligns with board column 7) we get this relative placement:\n • In the 0° rotation the block’s filled cells are at (0,0), (0,1), (1,1) and (1,2).\n • When dropped with its left edge in column 7 the block’s filled cells will go to:\n  – Row R, column 7\n  – Row R, column 8\n  – Row R+1, column 8\n  – Row R+1, column 9\nSimulating the fall on the given board shows that if you start very high the block will drop until further down it would cause a collision.\n• In our simulation it turns out that if the block’s top‐left lands in row 6 these four cells are:\n  – (6,7), (6,8) in the upper part of the block and\n  – (7,8), (7,9) in the lower row.\nEven though later rows (rows 8–10) have many already–occupied squares, this placement avoids any collision and is legal and safe.\n\nThus one valid move is to drop the block at coordinate 7 (using the 0° rotation).\n\nAnswer: 7 0","I analyzed the board and the possible placements. In this situation the falling “I‐tetromino” (which can be placed horizontally (0°\/180°) or vertically (90°\/270°)) has several valid drop coordinates. For example, if we drop it in horizontal form at x = 1, 2, or 3 it lands high (row 8) and does not complete any full row. On the other hand, a vertical drop in column 4 (using the 90° or 270° orientation) will drop its bottom cell as far as possible (landing with its cells in rows 7–10) and “fills in” one of the key gaps on the bottom row. (Currently row 10 – which reads \"**..******\" – is missing a block in column 4 among others; by dropping a vertical I in column 4, the piece’s bottom cell occupies row 10, making the row nearly complete and improving our board’s future state.) \n\nThus a sound move is to drop the block vertically in column 4 with a 90° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 4 90","Based on a quick analysis, I decided to use the horizontal shape (0° rotation, note that 0° and 180° are identical here) and drop it with its leftmost cell in column 1. Here’s my reasoning:\n\n• The current board shows that some of the lower rows already have obstacles. For a horizontal four‐cell piece (represented as “****”), dropping it in columns 1–4 will have it “land” when even one cell directly below would hit an already–occupied cell.\n• Examining each column (for a drop with leftmost coordinate 1), the first obstacle encountered is:\n  – Column 1: an obstacle only appears at row 10 (the bottom), so this gives room.\n  – Column 2: the first block lies in row 9.\n  – Column 3: likewise, the first block is in row 9.\n  – Column 4: there is a block already at row 7.\n• Because any part of the falling piece must stop when moving further down would cause a collision, the entire piece can fall only as far as its “most blocked” part allows. In this case that is column 4 (with its first block at row 7) so the piece lands with its cell in column 4 in row 6 (one row above the obstacle).\n• Placing the block in 0° rotation (i.e. horizontal “****”) from drop coordinate 1 is completely legal. It will land on row 6 with its cells occupying columns 1–4.\n• While no full line is cleared immediately, this placement avoids any “overhang” that might block later moves.\n\nThus, the chosen action is to drop the block with its leftmost square at column 1, rotation 0°.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","Based on the analysis, the best action is to drop the 2×2 block with its 0° rotation so that its leftmost square aligns with column 9. In that position the block will fall as far as possible (occupying board rows 8 and 9 in columns 9–10) without colliding with any existing blocks.\n\nAnswer: 9 0","I chose to drop the block with no rotation (0°) in the leftmost region (drop coordinate 1), because when the block (with its 0° configuration, which is rendered as two rows with a “hidden” gap in the top row and a full‐row in the bottom) falls in that area it will settle without colliding with any already placed blocks. In this configuration the block’s bottom row (which is “***”) lands on row 8 while its top part (“00*”, which has the star only in its rightmost position) lands on row 7. (Recall that the drop coordinate “1” means that the leftmost column of the block’s bounding box will line up with column 1 of the board.) A simulation shows that placing the block here lets it fall down as far as possible without any conflict and avoids any immediate over‐limit placement.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","Based on the board’s occupancy and the falling I‐piece (which in its 0°\/180° rotation appears as \"****\"), we want to let the piece fall as far as possible without colliding. A simulation shows that placing the horizontal piece (0° or 180°) with its leftmost square in column 4 lets it drop until row 5 before an obstruction in row 6 halts it. For example, with drop coordinate 4 in the 0° rotation, the piece lands in row 5 covering columns 4–7. (Any drop with columns 1–3 only lands in row 3; a drop with columns 6 or 7 lands a little higher—row 4. Also, switching to a vertical orientation would force part of the piece to collide with blocks already in the column, forcing it to land much higher.) Although the added squares do not complete a full row for a clearance, this placement safely adds blocks at the lowest possible level and avoids any collision with the top boundary.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","I analyzed several rotation options and drop positions. One valid strategy is to use the block in its 0° orientation. In that rotation the block’s two‐row shape (with its top row having a single star in the third column of the block’s 3‐column width and its bottom row a full row of three stars) can be safely dropped in column 1. (Here “drop_coordinate 1” means that the leftmost column of the block is aligned with column 1 of the board.) When dropped this way the block will fall far enough so that if an additional drop were attempted the lower star (in the row with the three-star pattern) would collide with the already–occupied cells further down (for example, row 4 already contains a star in column 3). In simulation the block safely lands with its top row landing at row 2 and its bottom row at row 3. Although this does not clear a full row on the board it is a legal, collision–free move.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","I'll choose to use the 180° rotation and drop with its leftmost square in column 7. In this placement the block lands so that its bottom part (the single square in the 180° rotation occurring below the center of the three‐square top row) fills the only gap (column 8) in row 5, transforming \"*******.**\" into a completely filled row. That full row then clears immediately and increases the score.\n\nThus, my answer is:  \nAnswer: 7 180","I'll choose to drop the block with a 180° rotation and have its leftmost square land in column 4.

Placing it with its leftmost square in column 1 lets the block slide as far down as possible before any filled square would hit an existing “*”. A rough simulation of the fall (checking row by row from the bottom upward) shows the block can descend deep—ultimately “landing” with its top row on row 7 and its bottom row on row 8. (Any attempt to let it fall further causes the filled squares to run into already–placed blocks in the lower rows.) \n\nBecause this move is legal and takes the falling piece deep into the stack—and it may even help eventually complete the missing square in later moves—I will take that action.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","Based on examining the board’s early rows and columns, I found that one safe (and playable) option is to use the block in its 0° rotation and “drop” it so that its leftmost square lands in column 8. In this rotation the block’s “filled” cells (ignoring the 0’s) form a pattern where the top row has a single square and the row below has three contiguous squares. Dropping it with its leftmost column at column 8 causes it to fall until the cells “just touch” parts of the board already occupied (for example in row 5 for column 8 and row 6 for the far‐right of the block), and the piece comes to rest entirely within rows 3–4. This placement is valid and does not force any block above the top of the board. (There is no immediate line clear with this move, but it is a well–placed and harmless continuation of play.)\n\nAnswer: 8 0","After analyzing the board we see that the only safe placement for our 2×2 square (which is identical in all rotations) is to avoid landing on already occupied portions. In particular a promising candidate is to drop the square with its leftmost column at column 9. In that placement the block will drop as far as it can while landing on rows 8–9 (since trying to drop one more row would push it into row 10 where cells in columns 9–10 are already occupied). Thus the move “drop at column 9 with 0° rotation” is legal and valid.\n\nAnswer: 9 0","Based on analyzing the board and testing possible placements with both the 0° (2×3) version and the 90° (3×2) version, one placement turned out viable. By using the 90° rotation (with block appearance as follows):\n Row1: *0  Row2: **  Row3: 0*\nthe block occupies cells (relative to its top‐left corner) at positions (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), and (2,1). Setting the leftmost column (drop coordinate) to 5 makes the block “fall” so that its final resting (visible) rows are 6–8 without overlapping an already occupied square. (For instance, with the block’s top cell landing at row 6, its occupied squares are at board positions (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), and (8,6) – all free on the board.) This placement does not force any row past the top boundary and avoids any immediate collision.\n\nAnswer: 5 90","I analyzed the board looking for a move that can complete a nearly‐full row. Notice row4 is “******.***” (only column 7 is empty). By dropping the “I” piece in its vertical orientation (either 90° or 270°) in column 7, the piece will land so that its bottom square is in row4. In doing so, the block fills the gap in row4, making that row full and thus clearing it and increasing the score.\n\nTo do this, we use the vertical shape (shown in the 90° rotation) and choose a drop coordinate of 7 (meaning the only column occupied by the block will be column 7).\n\nAnswer: 7 90","I'll use the following reasoning. We want to try and clear a nearly‐complete line. Notice that row4 currently is\n\n  \"***..*****\"\n\nso it is missing blocks only at columns 4 and 5. By rotating the falling block into its 90° orientation (whose filled cells are arranged as follows, with grid coordinates relative to the block’s top‐left):\n\n  Row1: [* 0]  (only the left cell occupied)\n  Row2: [* *]  (both cells occupied)\n  Row3: [0 *]  (only the right cell occupied)\n\nif we choose the drop coordinate as 4 (meaning the leftmost cell of the block will align with column 4), then we can “aim” to have the block come to rest so that its Row2 (cells at columns 4 and 5) lands exactly in row4 of the board. In that case, row4 would have its “..” gap (columns 4 and 5) filled by the falling block. Checking the other cells at the landing position (the block’s extra cells falling in row3 and row5) shows no collisions with the placed stars. In particular, row3 at column 4 (the first cell of the block in its 90° shape) is currently empty, and row5 at column 5 is empty as well.\n\nThus after the block lands the filled row4 becomes complete and is cleared – increasing the score. This move appears legal and advantageous.\n\nSo my answer is:\n\nAnswer: 4 90"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Choosing the 0° rotation gives a block with a width of 3 columns (as seen in the 0° matrix with “00*” on top and “***” on the bottom). This means the leftmost square (the drop coordinate) can be any column from 1 to 8. For clarity and safety, placing it at column 4 assures that the block will fall properly, entirely within the board’s 10 columns.\n\nThus, the chosen action is to drop the block at column 4 with a rotation of 0°. \n\nAnswer: 4 0","I analyzed the board and found that with the 0° (horizontal) rotation the block will fall as a one‐row “****” piece. Dropping it with its leftmost square at column 7 means it will cover columns 7–10. In this setting none of those columns have obstacles (the lower cells are all clear for columns 7–10) so the block falls to row 10. On row 10 the board already has stars in columns 4, 5, and 6 (from the previously placed pieces). Placing our block at x = 7 in 0° rotation adds stars in columns 7–10.

In this position the block will drop until it collides with the occupied cell in row 10 (the fourth column in row 10 is already filled) so that the block comes to rest in row 9. This avoids immediate problems and sets up a flat surface for later pieces. \n\nAnswer: 1 0","Based on the board configuration, one good option is to use the block in its horizontal (0°) orientation. Notice that rows 9 and 10 already have several occupied squares. In particular, row 9 is partially filled as \"****.*....\" while row 10 has the pattern \"...*******\" (with the right‐side columns completely occupied from column 4 onward). By choosing to drop the horizontal 4‐cell line so that its leftmost square lands in column 7, the block (covering columns 7–10) will fall as far as possible and come to rest on row 9. In that column span (columns 7–10), row 9 is entirely empty allowing the piece to drop all the way down until the row underneath (row 10) already contains blocks in those positions. This placement is legal (fits entirely inside the 10 columns) and does not cause any immediate row clear, but it is a safe and reasonable move given the current board state.\n\nAnswer: 7 0","I'll choose to use the 90° rotation.

When a row is fully occupied it is cleared and the score increases by 1.\n• Checking row 9: the block does not extend there, and row 9 is unchanged (“...*******”). Also, trying a drop one row further (with the top at row 7) would attempt to place a block cell in row 9 at (9,5) but row 9 column 5 is already occupied (“*”), so the block stops at row 6.\nThis move avoids any collision that would extend the block above the top boundary and successfully fills row 8. \n\nThus, the correct action is to drop the block so its leftmost square is in column 5 with a 90° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 5 90","I'll choose to use the vertical orientation (using the 90° rotation) and drop the current “I‐block” in column 1. In that configuration the block will fall safely into the left empty column and occupy rows 7–10 (with its bottom square resting on the board’s bottom). This move avoids any overlap with the existing pieces (which begin at column 4 on the lower rows) and does not cause an unintended game over situation.\n\nAnswer: 1 90","I'll choose to rotate the block 90° and drop it so that its leftmost column is 2. With the 90° rotation the block is shaped as follows:\n\n Row0: *0  \n Row1: *0  \n Row2: **\n\nDropping the block with its leftmost square at column 2 will have it fall so that Row2 lands on the bottom row (row 10). In that position the cells occupied by the block will be:\n\n• For Row0 (landing at board row 8): a block in column 2  \n• For Row1 (landing at board row 9): a block in column 2  \n• For Row2 (landing at board row 10): blocks in columns 2 and 3\n\nNotably row 10 of the board is originally \"*..*******\" (with dots at columns 2 and 3). Filling these two positions makes row 10 entirely occupied and clears the row automatically—thus increasing the score.\n\nTherefore, the chosen move is to drop the block at coordinate 2 with a 90° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 2 90","I'll drop the block using the 90° orientation and position it so that the leftmost column of the block’s bounding box is column 3. In that rotation, the block’s shape is\n\n Row1: *0  \n Row2: **  \n Row3: 0*  \n\nwhich means its occupied cells (relative to the block’s top‐left corner) are at (row1, col1), (row2, col1), (row2, col2) and (row3, col2). When dropped with its leftmost (bounding box) column at column 3, the piece will fall until its bottom cell (at row3 of the block) lands at row10 (the board’s bottom). Working out the collision, the block comes to rest with its top‐left corner at board row 8, column 3. Its cells then occupy positions (8,3), (9,3), (9,4), and (10,4). No collisions occur during the fall, and the landing is safe.\n\nAnswer: 3 90","I'll choose to drop the piece in its 0° rotation so that its leftmost square is in column 7. In this rotation the piece (spread over 2 rows and 3 columns) has its filled cells at the top‐row’s first two positions and in the bottom‐row’s last two positions. Dropping it with left column 7 means its occupied cells will fall into row 9 (columns 7–8) and row 10 (columns 8–9). There is no collision with the already‐placed blocks and the piece lands fully within the board. This move is safe and continues play without causing an overflow.\n\nAnswer: 7 0","Based on the board configuration, we want to fill a nearly‐complete row to clear a line. Notice that row 9 (********..) is missing two blocks in columns 9 and 10. By choosing the 90° rotation of the current piece, its bottom row spans two cells. If we drop this piece so that its leftmost column corresponds to board column 9, then the bottom row of the rotated block will fall in row 9 covering columns 9 and 10. (During the drop, the block’s filled cells are at relative positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) and (1,2) so that when the block’s top-left is placed at row 7, column 9 the cells land at positions: (7,9), (8,9), (9,9) and (9,10).) Checking the board:\n• Row 7 is entirely empty.\n• In row 8, column 9 is empty (row 8 is “*.*.......”).\n• In row 9, columns 9 and 10 are empty (“********..”).\n\nIf the block were to fall one extra row the cell at (10,9) would hit an existing block (since row 10 already has a star in that spot), so the piece rightly stops at row 7 and induces the drop. With its bottom row filling the missing gaps in row 9 (columns 9 and 10), the entire row becomes filled (“**********”) causing a clearance. This results in row clearance and an increased score.\n\nThus, the chosen action is to drop with leftmost coordinate 9 using a 90° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 9 90","I'll choose to drop the piece in its 0° orientation and align it so that its two bottom squares fall in columns 6 and 7 on the very bottom row (row 10). In the 0° shape the block’s occupied squares (relative to the top‐left corner) are:\n\n • Top row: squares in positions 2 and 3  \n • Bottom row: squares in positions 1 and 2\n\nThus, when dropping with a drop coordinate of 6, the block will span columns 6–8. It will land with its top row on row 9 and bottom row on row 10 so that the bottom row lands in columns 6 and 7. Checking the board:\n\n• In row 9 (currently “*.*.....*.”), columns 7 and 8 are empty.  \n• In row 10 (currently “**.**..**.”), columns 6 and 7 are empty.\n\nNo collisions occur and the block fits within the board boundaries. (Note that if we attempted to position the block further to the right, one of its cells would land in a column already occupied.) \n\nThus the chosen action is to drop at coordinate 6 with rotation 0°.\n\nAnswer: 6 0","I'll select a move using rotation 0°. In this rotation the block cells (using a 0-index inside the block grid) are at positions (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), and (1,1). When the leftmost column of the block is aligned with column 4 on the board the piece will fall as far as it can without colliding—settling with its two‐row shape in rows 8 and 9. In that final position the top row of the block occupies row 8 with cells in board columns 5 and 6 (since 4+1 and 4+2) and the bottom row occupies row 9 with cells at columns 4 and 5. A check of the board shows that with this placement no block cell overlaps an already occupied square. Although the piece cannot drop any lower (because a one–cell descent would force one cell into row 10 at column 4 where a block already exists) the block comes to rest without issue; no unintended collision occurs and no line is cleared immediately, but the move is fully legal.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","I've decided on a safe placement that avoids any collisions and lets the block drop without ending the game. In the scenario below I chose to use the 90° rotation and drop the block with its leftmost square in column 9.\n\nTo explain briefly: When using the 90° rotation the block’s pattern is\n\n  Row0: *0  \n  Row1: **  \n  Row2: 0*\n\nwhich means the block occupies two adjacent columns (columns 9 and 10 when dropped at drop coordinate 9) and three rows. By “dropping” the piece from above the board the block falls until a further drop would result in one of its squares overlapping an existing block. A simulation of the landing showed that the block will come to rest with its top cell landing in row 6. At that point its cells are added to rows 6 through 8 without forcing any collision. (Other placements were examined but this move remains safe and meets the game rules.)\n\nAnswer: 9 90","I'll use the simple 0° drop which safely lands without triggering a game‐over. In this plan the falling piece (using the 0° shape) is dropped with its leftmost column entering at column 3. With the 0° orientation the piece’s shape (with relative block positions at top row: columns 1 and 2; bottom row: columns 2 and 3) will then fall until one more downward move would lead a block square into an already occupied cell. A quick simulation shows that with drop coordinate 3 the piece descends until its top-left ends up on row 6. In that final placement, its squares land at board cells (6,3) and (6,4) and (7,4) and (7,5) – all safely above the already present blocks. This move does not create a complete row (so score remains unchanged), but avoids any loss and works legally for the current board state.\n\nAnswer: 3 0","We can choose any orientation since every rotation of a 2×2 square is identical. One promising idea is to drop the block so that it reaches as low as possible (i.e. “settles” lower on the board) rather than stopping high because of obstacles. For instance, if we “drop” the 2×2 block with its left‐side in column 1 the following happens:\n\n• The block covers columns 1–2.\n• Looking down column 1 the first already‐occupied square is found on row 9 and in column 2 on row 10. (Remember that rows are numbered from the top, and the bottom row is row 10.) Therefore the block is “allowed” to fall until its bottom touches row 8—so that if it fell one more row (occupying rows 8–9) a collision would occur in column 1.\n• This results in the block “settling” with its top in row 7 and its bottom in row 8.\n• No full row is formed immediately, but the block lands in a low position, helping to keep the pile from rising too high.\n\nBecause the block is a square, choosing a rotation of 0° (or 90°, 180°, 270° for that matter) is equivalent. In our solution we choose rotation 0°. (Drop-coordinate numbers go from 1 (left‐edge) to 10 (right‐edge) as given.)\n\nThus, one valid and reasonable answer is:\n\nAnswer: 1 0","Based on the board’s current configuration and having “eyed” a safe landing zone for the falling piece, one valid plan is to use the 0° rotation. In that orientation the piece’s blocks fall (relative to its bounding box) at \n • top row: a block at relative column 1 \n • bottom row: blocks filling all three relative columns.\nWhen dropping with the left‐most part in column 4 the piece can fall fully until its lower row would hit row 6 (because row 6 already contains blocks in column 4). Working “up‐one step” (landing with the top of the block in row 4 and its bottom row in row 5) the piece fits without colliding with any previously placed blocks. (Any further descent would cause one of its cells to hit an occupied square.) \n\nThus one acceptable move is to drop the piece at drop_coordinate 4 with no further rotation (0°).\n\nAnswer: 4 0","I'll choose to rotate the falling block 90° and drop it so that its left‐most square lands in column 3. With that rotation the piece’s two–square row placed in columns 3–4 will begin to “lock” right beside existing blocks, and its long “tail” will neatly slide into a gap below. (In more technical terms, rotating to 90° gives the block squares at offsets (0,0), (1,0), (0,1) and (0,2); dropping it with its left–most unit on column 3 places those squares in columns 3 and 4 in such a way that the bottom block ends up filling a needed gap without causing an immediate collision.) \n\nAnswer: 3 90","Based on the board state and the fact that the current piece is a 2×2 square (which looks identical from every rotation), one valid move is to drop the block with its left edge in column 1 (using a 0° rotation). In that case the block will fall until it lands on top of the already–placed pieces so that its bottom touches row 6 (with it occupying rows 5–6 in columns 1–2), which does not cause any collision or exceed the board. This is a legal move according to the rules provided.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","After analyzing the board structure and available landing “depths” for the given block in its four rotation states, I determined that one promising move is to use the 270° rotation. In this orientation the block (“**” on the first row, then “0*” and “0*” on the next two rows) occupies a compact two‐column, three‐row area. By dropping it so that its leftmost column falls at column 8 it can fall far enough for the lower “0*” cells to sit just above the existing blocks without “touching” any occupied cell prematurely. (A quick check shows that in column 9 the first obstacle comes early so that with drop coordinate 8 the block will “land” low enough but not so low as to cause an immediate game over; meanwhile, column 8 is less “busy,” allowing the block to settle into a useful position.) \n\nThus, my chosen action is to drop the block with leftmost square at column 8 using a 270° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 8 270","Based on my analysis, I choose to rotate the block by 90° and to drop it so that the leftmost column of its bounding box is column 7. In this chosen rotation the block’s “footprint” is\n\n  Row0: [* 0]\n  Row1: [* 0]\n  Row2: [* *]\n\nIf placed with the leftmost column = 7, then when the piece falls it will eventually come to rest with its bottom row (Row2 of the block) landing in row 8 of the board. That placement puts the block’s cells at:\n • Row6, column 7 (from block Row0)\n • Row7, column 7 (from block Row1)\n • Row8, columns 7 and 8 (from block Row2)\n\nI verified that in the board these cells (from row6 “****....*.”, row7 “**.**...**” and row8 “**..**..**”) are empty so that the block can fall without collision all the way down. This drop uses the board’s gaps at that level rather than stopping high as would occur with some other rotations or drop columns.

Since the board only has occupied squares at columns 5 and 6 in the bottom two rows, no collisions occur. This keeps the playfield open for future moves.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","Based on the board situation and the falling block options, one straightforward legal move is to use the 0° rotation (the horizontal “****” shape) and drop it with its leftmost square in Column 1. In this case the block will fall until it lands on Row 8 (since Row 9 already has a block at Column 1) and stops because a further move would cause a collision. This move is valid and complies with the board boundaries and landing rules.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","I’ve analyzed the board and the two distinct block rotations. In the 90° rotation the block’s occupied cells (using zero‐based offsets) are:\n • (0,1)\n • (1,0)\n • (1,1)\n • (2,0)\n\nThat means when dropped with its leftmost column at X the cells would go to:\n • Row r, column X+1\n • Row r+1, column X\n • Row r+1, column X+1\n • Row r+2, column X\n\nBecause the piece in this form is 2 columns wide and 3 rows tall, the lowest row the top of the block can be placed is r = 8 (so that r+2 = 10, the board’s bottom). Picking X = 8 gives the following final coordinates:\n • (8, 9)  from (0,1)\n • (9, 8)  from (1,0)\n • (9, 9)  from (1,1)\n • (10, 8) from (2,0)\n\nChecking these against the board:\n • Row 8 (“****......”) has columns 1–4 filled; column 9 is empty.\n • Row 9 (“*...**....”) has filled squares only in columns 1, 5 and 6; so columns 8 and 9 are empty.\n • Row 10 (“***.**....”) has filled squares in columns 1–3 and 5–6; column 8 is empty.\nThere is no collision and the piece falls as low as possible.\n\nThus, a good valid move is to drop with the leftmost column = 8 using a 90° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 8 90","I'll choose to drop the current block with a 90° rotation and have the leftmost cell land in column 7. In this orientation the block’s filled cells (using offsets relative to its top‐left corner) are at (0,0), (1,0), (1,1) and (2,0). When dropped at column 7 it will descend until its lowest row (row r+2) reaches nearly the bottom and it stops before a collision occurs. A simulation shows that if the top left corner of the piece is at row 7, then the filled positions become:\n• Row 7, column 7\n• Row 8, columns 7 and 8\n• Row 9, column 7\n\nChecking the board:\n• Row 7 is empty.\n• In Row 8 (which reads \"****....*.\"), columns 7 and 8 are both blank.\n• In Row 9 (\"*...**.**.\"), column 7 is also empty.\nAttempting to drop one more row would cause one of the block’s cells (specifically at row 9,col8) to hit an already occupied space, so landing with the top left at row 7 is indeed the lowest safe placement.\n\nThus, my action is to drop at column 7 with a 90° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 7 90","I'll choose to drop the piece with a 90° rotation. In that orientation the block looks like this:\n\n  Row0: **  \n  Row1: *0  \n  Row2: *0  \n\nWhen dropped with its leftmost column aligned with column 5, the falling block’s filled squares (relative to its top‐left corner) will eventually come to rest with its top row landing in row 6. (That is, the two squares of row0 will end up in row 6 at columns 5 and 6, the single square of row1 in row 7 at column 5, and the single square of row2 in row 8 at column 5.) This placement avoids any collisions with the existing blocks and stays entirely within the board boundaries.\n\nThus, my action is:\n\nAnswer: 5 90","I'll choose to drop the block in its 0° orientation so that its squares eventually occupy board positions (6,1) & (6,2) on the top row of the block and (7,2) & (7,3) on its bottom row. (Remember that with the 0° shape, the block’s occupied cells are at offsets (0,0), (0,1), (1,1) and (1,2) relative to its top‐left corner.) Under a drop coordinate of 1 the block falls without colliding until its top row arrives at row 6 (and its bottom row at row 7), which avoids any obstacles on the board.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","I analyzed the board and simulated the fall for the I‐shaped piece. In its horizontal form the piece would fall only as far as row 5 (because row 6 has obstacles in many columns), but in its vertical orientation—specifically when dropped in the rightmost column—the column is completely free from row 6 downwards. In column 10 every cell is empty until row 10 so a vertical piece dropped there will descend all the way down (occupying rows 7–10) without interference. This placement avoids any immediate collision and optimizes the landing depth.\n\nThus, using the vertical form (90° rotation) and dropping with the leftmost square at column 10 provides a valid move.\n\nAnswer: 10 90","Based on my analysis the safest and legal move is to drop the block in its horizontal orientation (0°) with its leftmost square over column 7. In that case the 4‐cell horizontal block (“****”) will fall all the way until row 6 – because when checking row 7 the cell at column 7 (and also column 10) is already occupied – and so it will come to rest in row 6, occupying columns 7–10. This move is legal and does not force an immediate game over.\n\nAnswer: 7 0","I'll choose to use the 180° version of the block and drop it with its left‐most column in position 2.\n\nRationale:\n• In the 180° rotation the block’s top row is “***” and its bottom row is “00*”. This means that one of its rows (the top row) is three consecutive squares.\n• Looking at the nearly full rows, row 9 on the board is “*...******” – it has stars in column 1 and 5–10 but is missing blocks in columns 2–4.\n• By dropping the 180° block with leftmost coordinate 2 so that its top row lands on row 9 (covering columns 2–4) and its bottom row on row 10 (filling column 4), we fill exactly the gap in row 9. That results in row 9 becoming completely filled and thus cleared (increasing the score by one).\n• A check of each board cell confirms that none of the falling block’s cells would overlap an already occupied cell when placed in the final position.\n\nThus, the chosen action is:\n\nAnswer: 2 180","I'll choose to drop the block using its 0° orientation with its left‐most column at column 5. In that configuration the block (which in 0° is a 2×3 shape with its top row having a block in column 1 and its bottom row full) will fall until its bottom row lands on row 5. (Dropping further would cause the bottom row to hit row 6 – which is already mostly occupied – so the block stops with its top row in row 4 and its bottom row in row 5. This placement does not cause any collisions with the already occupied cells.)\n\nThus, the chosen action is to drop using leftmost coordinate 5 with 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","I analyzed the board’s occupied cells and estimated how far a falling “Z‐tetromino” (which looks like the “0°” rotation given) can fall when dropped at each possible column. One valid placement is to use the 0° orientation and drop it so that its leftmost block lands in column 8. In this rotation the block’s shape is\n\n  Row1: [*][*][0]  and  Row2: [0][*][*]\n\nso when its grid is positioned with its left edge starting at column 8 the block covers board columns 8–10. Working out the “landing height” (i.e. how far it can fall without overlapping any of the board’s '*' cells) shows that with drop coordinate 8 the piece will safely come to rest with its two rows placed (roughly) on board rows 4–5. (A quick check shows that the first row of the block will land on an empty row and the second row will fill two cells on a row that is still not full, so no illegal overlap occurs.)\n\nThus one valid answer is to place the block with drop coordinate 8 and no rotation (0°).\n\nAnswer: 8 0","I analyzed the board and the shape of the falling tetromino. For example, using the 0° rotation the block’s “footprint” is a 2‑row by 3‑column area with blocks in the top‐row left two cells and in the bottom row the right two cells. One safe way to play is to have the block fall so that its leftmost column is column 1. In that case, when dropping in column 1 with 0° rotation the block will fall until one of its cells hits an obstacle (in this case the already–occupied cells around row 5–6) and come to rest without immediately exceeding the top edge.\n\nThus, after verifying that none of the block’s cells would conflict on landing and that its placement is legal, I choose to drop the block with no rotation (0°) and a drop coordinate of 1.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","After carefully “playing out” the board and considering safe landing positions for the current block, I decided on one that avoids collisions and lets the piece drop without going out‐of‐bounds. In a simulation using the 0° shape (with layout):\n\n  Row1: 0 * 0  \n  Row2: * * *\n\nand aligning it across the middle of the board (so that its three columns cover columns 4–6), the falling block will descend until its bottom row lands in row 3 (since row 4 already contains a block in column 5). This placement is legal and does not cause any immediate conflict.\n\nThus my action is to drop the block with its 0° rotation with its leftmost square in column 4.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","I analyzed the board and noted that several column pairs end up colliding very soon. For example, if we try to drop the 2×2 block in columns where a filled square already exists in a lower row (such as columns 4–5 or 5–6), the block won’t be able to fall far at all. In contrast, if we drop the block so that its leftmost square is in column 7 (so that the block spans columns 7 and 8), then it can drop one row farther before a collision occurs (its bottom would meet an obstruction in row 4 rather than row 3). In that simulation the block falls from the top:\n• At initial placement the block (columns 7–8) is not colliding.\n• It drops one row so that its cells are in rows 2 and 3. (A trial to move it one more row—placing it in rows 3 and 4—would collide with the occupied square in row 4, column 8.)\nThus the final resting position for a drop from column 7 (with no rotation change – a 0° rotation) is as far down as possible without overlap and is legal. (Since the current 2×2 block is symmetric, any rotation yields the same shape, but 0° is the simplest choice.)\n\nAnswer: 7 0","","After analyzing the board and the four possible rotations, I decided that a good legal drop (one that does not collide immediately and lands legal‐ly) is to rotate the block to 90° and drop it so that the block’s leftmost column lands in the third board column. In that rotation the block’s occupied cells (relative to its top‐left corner) are at positions (0,0), (1,0), (1,1) and (2,0). Dropping this block in column 3 produces a legal placement (with the top cell landing on row 1 and the block “stopping” immediately further down because of a collision on its next move). \n\nThus my action is:\n\nAnswer: 3 90","Based on the board, one promising move is to drop the 2×2 block at column 9 with no rotation (0°). Doing so fills the two empty cells at the end of row 3 – turning \"********..\" into \"**********\" – which triggers a line clear and increases the score.\n\nAnswer: 9 0","After careful analysis of the board and possible placements, one valid move is to drop the 0°‐rotated block (with shape):\n\n  Row0: 0**\n  Row1: **0\n\nwith its bounding box’s left edge at column 4. In that placement the block’s occupied cells are mapped as follows:\n  • From the top row of the block: the cells fall into board positions (row1, col5) and (row1, col6).\n  • From the bottom row of the block: they fall into board positions (row2, col4) and (row2, col5).\nA check shows that row1 is completely empty and row2 (“..*.......”) has an obstacle only in column 3, so these cells are free. Moreover, when we simulate letting the block fall one row further, a collision occurs (for example, row3 already has blocks at columns 4–5), so the block correctly lands with its upper left corner at row1.\n \nThus, the chosen action is to drop the block (in its 0° rotation) with drop coordinate 4.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","Based on analyzing the board and the falling-block rotations, one reasonable strategy is to use the 0° rotation. In that orientation the block’s shape is\n\n   0*0  \n   ***\n\nso that the only filled cell in its top row is in the middle column and the bottom row is completely solid. That enables a drop in such a way that the block “fits” nicely into the existing structure without “overcrowding” the top and also has some chance of helping complete a row and trigger a clear.\n\nAfter reviewing the board’s configuration it appears that if we drop the block with its left‐most cell placed in column 4 (remembering that columns are numbered 1–10) and use no additional rotation (i.e. 0°), it will settle in a safe position while potentially setting up a line clear.

This move does not clear any rows yet, but it positions the block without conflict.\n\nAnswer: 3 0","Based on the board and the piece’s available rotations, a simple and safe strategy is to use the 0° rotation (which has the block arranged as a 2‐row shape with a single block in the top row at the left and three consecutive blocks in the bottom row). When dropped with its leftmost square aligned with column 5, none of its filled squares will land on top of the existing blocks (which only fill columns 1–4 in rows 9 and 10) so that the piece lands entirely in the empty space on the right side of the board. The 0° rotation shape is:\n\n  Row1: *00   (occupied only at the first column)  \n  Row2: ***   (occupied in all three columns)\n\nDropping this piece at coordinate 5 with 0° means that after falling, its bottom row will exactly occupy columns 5–7 of the board’s bottom row. This move avoids any collisions with the current blocks and is a valid safe play.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","Let's analyze the situation:\n\n1. The board has 10 columns and 10 rows. In particular:\n  – Row 9: \"*****.....\" (columns 1–5 are blocked, 6–10 clear)\n  – Row 10: \"*******...\" (columns 1–7 are blocked, 8–10 clear)\n\n2. The Current Block has four rotation states. In the 0° rotation the block looks like this:\n  Row 1: *00  (only the leftmost column is occupied)\n  Row 2: ***  (all three columns are occupied)\n  So its “occupied” squares are at coordinates (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), and (1,2) relative to the block’s top‐left corner.\n\n3. When dropping a block, we specify the board column where the leftmost column of the block (its bounding box) will be placed. Then the block falls vertically until any further move would cause one of its occupied squares to either exceed the board’s bottom or collide with an existing block.\n\n4. Consider rotation 0° and choose a drop coordinate of 8:\n  – The block’s columns span positions: 8, 9, and 10.\n  – Labeling rows from the top (1) to bottom (10), the block (which is 2 rows high) will land with its bottom row as low as possible.\n  – The lowest valid top–left row is row 9 (because then the block covers rows 9 and 10). At R = 9 the occupied square positions will be:\n   • (9,8) from (0,0)\n   • (10,8), (10,9), (10,10) from (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) respectively.\n  – Checking:\n   • Row 9, column 8 is empty (since row 9 has stars only in columns 1 through 5).\n   • Row 10, columns 8–10 are empty (row 10 has stars only in columns 1 to 7).\n  So the block can fall to that position without collision.\n\n5.

That full row is cleared and the score increases by 1.\n  – Row 9 gets a star added at column 8, leaving it not full.\n  This move yields a beneficial clearance.\n\nThus the optimal action is to drop the block with its 0° rotation and align the leftmost square of its bounding box with column 8.\n\nAnswer: 8 0","I'll choose to drop the block in its 0° orientation and align its left‐most filled square in column 5. In this placement, the block’s two rows will come to rest so that its bottom row occupies row 10. (Recall that in 0° the block’s filled cells are in the pattern: the top row fills the first two cells and the bottom row fills the second and third cells relative to the block’s left‐most filled square.) With a drop at column 5, the bottom row of the block (cells going to board columns 6 and 7) lands on empty spots in row 10 while not overlapping the already occupied cells in that row. Although this does not immediately complete a row (row 10 originally has “*****..*..”, so after placement it becomes “********..”, still missing blocks in columns 9 and 10), it is a valid move that obeys all the rules.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","I'll choose to use the unrotated horizontal bar (0° rotation) and drop it so its leftmost square is in column 1. In this case the bar “****” falls and, due to the row‐below having pre‐placed blocks (the bottom row has “********..”), it will settle in row 9. The four new blocks will occupy columns 1–4 of row 9. (Row 9 was originally “....**....”, so after the placement it becomes “******....”, which does not clear the row but is a safe placement.)\n\nAnswer: 1 0","Based on the board configuration, we can aim to clear the nearly‐completed bottom row (row 10 when using 1-indexed numbering). In the current board, the bottom row (row 10) has its first eight columns already filled, with columns 9 and 10 empty. If we use the 0° rotation of the block (which is identical to its 180° rotation), its shape is:\n\n  Row1: “**0”  – meaning it occupies the leftmost two squares (columns 1 and 2, relative to the block’s position);\n  Row2: “0**”  – meaning it occupies the rightmost two squares (columns 2 and 3).\n\nWhen dropping the block, we position its top row such that the entire piece lands as low as possible. Let the leftmost column (in 0‑index) where we place the block be c; then the block’s occupied board cells will be:\n  Top row at r: cells at (r, c) and (r, c+1)\n  Bottom row at r+1: cells at (r+1, c+1) and (r+1, c+2)\n\nNotice that row 10 (the last row, index 9 in 0‑based but “10” in our 1‑indexed board) is missing blocks in columns 9 and 10. To complete row 10 we need the block’s two squares in its bottom row to land in these columns. This means we want:\n  c+1 = 8 and c+2 = 9   (using 0‑index for board columns)\nSo, c must be 7. Also, we let the piece fall so that its bottom row (r+1) is row 9 (0‑index) i.e. row 10 in 1‑indexed terms; that forces r = 8.\n\nNow checking collisions:\n• Row 9 (0‑based row8) originally is “******....” so columns 0–5 are occupied while columns 6–9 are empty.\n• Row 10 (0‑based row9) is “********..” so columns 0–7 are occupied and columns 8–9 empty.\nPlacing the block using c = 7 (so answering in 1‑indexed terms as 7+1 = 8) in 0° rotation gives:\n  Top row: (8, 7) and (8, 8)\n  Bottom row: (9, 8) and (9, 9)\nNone of these cells are already occupied; in fact, the two cells in the bottom row fill the gaps at columns 9 and 10 (1‑indexed) in row 10 and clear that row. This also increases the score by 1.\n\nThus the best move is to drop with leftmost column 8 and no rotation (0°).\n\nAnswer: 8 0","I analyzed the board and the available rotations. The board’s bottom (row 10) is almost completely filled except for column 7 and column 10. If we try using the horizontal 0° (or 180°) form, the four‐cell “line” would land too high since any placement that would drop it into the bottom row causes a collision with already occupied cells. On the other hand, the vertical configuration (either 90° or 270°) can safely fall into an empty column on the bottom row if that particular column is not already occupied on row 10.\n\nReviewing the board:\n Row 10: \"******.**.\" corresponds to filled cells in columns 1–6 and 8–9, with columns 7 and 10 empty.\n\nIf we drop the vertical block in column 7 (by choosing drop coordinate 7 and rotation 90, for example), the block will fall until its bottom cell reaches row 10 (since column 7, row 10 is empty). The vertical block, once placed, will occupy column 7 in rows 7, 8, 9, and 10. This will fill the gap in row 10 at column 7 without any collision. (Note that a drop in column 10 would also be valid but it would leave column 7 still empty.)\n\nThus the chosen move is to drop the block in column 7 with a 90° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 7 90","Based on the board’s current state and the two possible rotation orientations (0°\/180° and 90°\/270°), one safe move is to use the 0° orientation (which is equivalent to the 180° orientation) and drop the piece so that its leftmost square is in column 8. When dropping the block with 0° rotation, the piece (which in its 0° configuration covers two rows and three columns with occupied cells at offsets (0,0), (1,0), (1,1) and (2,1)) will fall until its top row is row 8. In that case the top row of the block lands in row 8 and the bottom row lands in row 9 – avoiding a collision with the filled row 10 (which already has nine cells occupied). This move neither causes premature game termination nor a collision, and although no row is cleared this round, it is a valid safe play.\n\nAnswer: 8 0","I'll choose to drop the block in its horizontal orientation (0°) with its left‐most block positioned in column 1. In that placement the 4‑block horizontal bar will fall onto an area where in all of columns 1–4 the “support” (i.e. the first encountered block from below) is in row 10. This means that the falling piece “lands” one row above that support – i.e. on row 9. Checking row 9 (“......*.**”) we see that columns 1–4 are empty so this placement is legal (and no collision occurs). Although no complete row is cleared immediately, this move is safe and keeps the stack as low as possible without causing any overlap.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","I'll choose to drop the block with no rotation (0°) in the leftmost column (drop coordinate 1). In that configuration, the 0° block (with shape\n\n  *00  \n  ***)\n\nwill fall until its bottom row comes to rest at row 8 (with its top row at row 7). Because the board’s left‐side columns in those rows are entirely empty, no collisions occur.

With this drop the block will descend until one more move would force one of its cells to collide with the already‐occupied cells in row7. That means the block will settle with its top row in row 5 and its bottom row in row 6. In row 6 the block’s cells fill columns 1–3, and since row 6’s columns 1–8 are empty (only columns 9–10 have blocks), this placement is completely valid and does not end the game.\n\nThus a correct legal move is to drop the block at drop_coordinate 1 with a 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","I'll choose to play the block in its 0° orientation and shift it so that its left‐most filled cell (the “anchor” at the top left of the 2×3 pattern) is dropped in column 2. In the 0° rotation the current block looks like\n\n  Row1: *   *   0  \n  Row2: 0   *   *\n\nso that when its left‐most block is placed in column 2 the filled cells will cover columns 2–4 (with the filled cells at offsets (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), and (1,2)). With the board given the block will fall until it can go no further. A quick “drop simulation” (by testing landing positions from the bottom upward) shows that if dropped in column 2 the piece will descend and “settle” so that its filled cells come to rest in a configuration with its top row landing on board row 4 and its bottom row on row 5. (For example, starting from the empty upper rows the block can fall safely until – if it attempted to drop one more row – one of its cells would collide with an already placed block in row 5.) \n\nThis is a legal move, and while it does not immediately clear a line it avoids any collisions and is within board boundaries.\n\nAnswer: 2 0","I analyzed the board and considered how the current block (which can be rotated in four distinct ways) might be safely dropped. One promising option is to use the 180° rotation. In that rotation the block looks as follows:\n\n  Row1: ***  \n  Row2: *00  \n\n(where the “*” indicate the squares that are present). When placed so that the leftmost square’s column is 1 (i.e. the block’s three‐wide row covers columns 1–3, and its second row is under column 1) the block eventually “lands” high enough so that none of its squares would overlap an already occupied square.\n\nTo explain briefly:\n• Placing the block at drop coordinate 1 in the 180° rotation positions its top row at some row R and bottom row at R+1.\n• Testing the “fall” shows that if we allow the block to descend any further the bottom cell (at column 1) would attempt to enter an occupied cell (since row 4 already has blocks in its other columns and row 6 is almost solid on the left), so the piece comes to rest with its top row on R = 3 and its bottom row on R = 4.\n• In this placement the block adds new squares at row 3, columns 1–3 and at row 4, column 1. (Note that row 3 was empty, and the square in row 4 is placed only in column 1 where there was no block.) Thus there is no overlap and the move is legal.\n\nThis move does not complete a line immediately but safely adds the new block without causing a game‐ending collision. Therefore, the chosen action is:\n\nAnswer: 1 180","I’ve studied the board and considered several placements. One idea was to try and “fill the gap” on a nearly‐complete row (row 10 is filled in columns 1–9, missing only column 10). In the 0° (or 180°) orientation the block’s shape is\n\n  Row1: [*][*][ ]\n  Row2: [ ][*][*]\n\nso one of its cells (the bottom–right) falls two columns to the right of the leftmost one. In order for that cell to land at column 10, we’d need to drop the block at x‑coordinate 8 so that the block covers columns 8–10. In an ideal scenario the block might “sink” so that its bottom row rests on row 10 (thus filling the missing spot), but when we simulate the drop (scanning row by row from the top):\n\n• With drop coordinate 8 (and 0° rotation) the final landing position would have the block’s top row on row 9 and bottom row on row 10. However, checking row 9 the block would place a cell at column 9 – and row 9 already has a block in column 9. That collision prevents the block from moving that far down.\n\nAfter testing a few candidates (including 90° rotations) it turns out the safest valid landing is to use the 0° rotation with drop coordinate 8. In that case the block will land earlier – its top row ends up on row 4 and bottom row on row 5—without any collisions.\n\nThus, the optimal move in the given situation is to drop the block at column 8 with 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 8 0","I'll choose to drop the block in its 0° orientation into column 1. In 0° the block consists of a single filled square on the top and a row of three filled squares beneath it; dropping it on the far‐left (drop coordinate 1) avoids any collisions and places the block safely on the board.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","I'll use the 0° rotation with the left‐edge drop coordinate set so that the block lands safely without overlapping existing pieces. In the 0° orientation the block is 2 rows high and 3 columns wide; its top row has a single occupied cell in the leftmost position and its bottom row is fully occupied. I’ve verified that if we choose the drop coordinate 4 then the block will fall until its bottom row reaches row 4 (since row 5 already has an occupied cell at column 4) and the placement will be valid; none of the block’s cells will collide with existing blocks. (This move does not complete any full row, but it is a safe legal move.) \n\nAnswer: 4 0","Based on my analysis, one promising strategy is to use the 90° rotation. In that configuration the block’s filled cells are located one cell to the right on its top row and then entirely fill the next two rows in an “L‐shaped” pattern (with the bottom row having only one filled square). In concrete terms, when rotated 90° the block looks as follows:\n\n  Row0: 0 *\n  Row1: * *\n  Row2: * 0\n\nThat is, if we label the “left‐most” column as x then the final squares (relative to the top–left of the block placement) appear at:\n  • (row, col) = (R, x+1)\n  • (R+1, x) and (R+1, x+1)\n  • (R+2, x)\n\nI looked over the board and noticed that although several rows are nearly complete the best “landing” can be achieved by dropping the piece so that it settles as low as possible. In the board’s nearly “filled” lower parts the gap in row10 (the right–most cell) is hard to fill from a legal drop. In contrast, placing the block in the “middle‐to‐right” (around column 5 or 6) lets it fall much further. For example, if we drop the piece in rotation 90° with its left–most square over column 5 then the occupied cells will be:\n\n  • Row7: column 6\n  • Row8: columns 5 and 6\n  • Row9: column 5\n\nA simulation of the fall shows that the block can indeed drop to R = 7 (that is, its top row landing at row 7) before one extra drop would cause a collision in row 10. This move does not immediately clear a row but it keeps the block low – an important goal for survival in Tetris. (Other placements either stop much higher or would run into obstruction right away.) \n\nThus, the recommended move is to drop with leftmost coordinate 5 in the 90° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 5 90","Based on the board’s nearly complete bottom row, we want to drop the block so that one of its pieces fills the one missing cell at the far‐right of row 10. In the 0° rotation, the 2×3 block has its only block piece in the top row at its rightmost position and a full row of three on its bottom. If we drop this block with its leftmost column over column 8 on the board, then when the piece lands (with its bottom row becoming row 10), the bottom row of the block will cover columns 8, 9, and 10 while its top row will contribute an extra piece at column 10 in row 9. Since row 10 on the board is “*********.” (i.e. columns 1–9 are filled and column 10 is empty), this drop will fill column 10. The result is a fully filled row which then immediately clears to increase the score.\n\nNo other rotation and drop position gives as straightforward a way to complete the row. Thus, the optimal action is to drop the block as given by the leftmost column = 8 and with no rotation (0°).\n\nAnswer: 8 0","I'll choose to drop the block in position 6 with 0° rotation. In that move the 2×2 square (which is identical in all rotations) will fall in columns 6 and 7. Based on a step‐by‐step simulation, when dropped in column 6 the block will continue falling until its bottom row is row 6 (with its top row at row 5). (Trying to drop it any lower—such as having its bottom in row 7—would run into an existing block at row 7, column 7.) Although this move won’t complete any row, it is a safe, valid placement.\n\nAnswer: 6 0"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

This block fits anywhere as long as its 2 columns can be placed fully within columns 1–10. Choosing a drop coordinate of 5 means that the leftmost square of the block lands in column 5 (resulting in the block occupying columns 5 and 6 on the board), which is a valid move. Since the block shape is identical regardless of rotation, using 0° is sufficient.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","Here's my reasoning:\n\nThe board is almost empty apart from the two 2×2 squares in the center of the bottom rows (rows 9 and 10, columns 5–6). The falling block (in all rotations its shape is identical) spans 2 rows and 3 columns. In its 0° rotation its internal pattern is:\n\n  Row1: [0, *, *]  \n  Row2: [*, *, 0]\n\nThis means that when dropping it, the leftmost column of its 3‑cell width will be positioned at the chosen drop coordinate. For example, if we place the leftmost square in column 1 (which is safely away from the existing blocks), then the block will fall with its bottom row landing on row 10 (the board’s bottom), resting with its cells in:\n  Row 9: columns 2 and 3 (from the top row’s *’s)  \n  Row 10: columns 1 and 2 (from the bottom row’s *’s)\n\nSince none of these cells conflict with the already occupied board cells (which are located in columns 5 and 6 of rows 9 and 10), this placement is valid and causes the block to safely land without any issues.\n\nThus, a safe and straightforward move is to drop the 0° rotated block with its leftmost square in column 1.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","After reviewing the board and the block’s possible rotations, I note that one safe and straightforward option is to use the block’s 0° rotation (with the pattern where the top row is “00*” and the bottom row is “***”) and drop it so that its leftmost square lands in column 1. In 0° the block’s “active” squares are at relative positions (row0, col2) and (row1, col0, col1, col2). Dropping it at column 1 (i.e. leftmost board column) and letting it fall will have it land high enough so that no already‐occupied square (from the two nearly bottom rows) is hit. (A quick simulation shows that if we try to drop it any lower, the squares of the block would hit the preexisting “*” symbols on row 9 or row 8. With drop coordinate 1 the block comes to rest with its top row at row 6 and its bottom row at row 7, where the board is entirely empty.)\n\nThus, this move safely places four new blocks without causing a block to exceed the top boundary, and it leaves clear room for subsequent rounds.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","I examined the board and the four possible rotations.\n\nLet’s quickly summarize one valid option:\n• Using the 0° rotation (which has the shape:\n  Row1: 0 * 0    (meaning only the center square is filled)\n  Row2: * * *    (all three squares are filled))\nthe grid “footprint” is 2 rows by 3 columns. In this rotation the “leftmost” filled square (at the lower row, first column relative to the block) is in the leftmost column of the block’s bounding box.\n• If we decide to “drop” the block so that the block bounding box starts in column 4 (so that the leftmost filled cell lands in column 4), then when it falls the piece will come to rest as follows:\n – Its bottom row (row r+1) occupies columns 4, 5, and 6.\n – Its top row (row r) occupies column 5.\nI checked the board: placing the block at column 4 in 0° rotation lets the block fall far enough without colliding with any existing squares. (For instance, a simulation shows that at the lowest legal position the block’s top row is row 7 and the bottom row is row 8—neither of them hits an existing block at columns 4, 5, or 6.)\nThis is a valid move that avoids an early game over and does not trigger an unwanted collision.\n\nThus one legal answer is to drop at column 4 with 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","I analyzed the board and the Z‐shaped block (which in 0° and 180° rotations has this pattern:\n\n  Row1: **0   (meaning columns 1 and 2 are filled)\n  Row2: 0**   (meaning columns 2 and 3 are filled)\n\nIn this orientation the block’s bounding box is three columns wide and two rows high. Choosing a drop coordinate means that the leftmost column of the block (its bounding box) will be aligned with the specified board column.\n \nI looked for a placement that avoids collision with the existing blocks (note the board has scattered blocks in rows 7–10) and that lands in a stable position. One valid approach is to choose the 0° orientation and drop the piece at column 7. In that case, if the top of the block’s bounding box lands at row 9 then its squares occupy:\n  • Row9, columns 7 and 8 (from the top row of the piece)\n  • Row10, columns 8 and 9 (from the bottom row of the piece)\n \nChecking the board:\n  • In row9 (\".**.**....\") columns 7 and 8 are empty.\n  • In row10 (\"**..**....\") columns 8 and 9 are empty.\n \nThus there is no collision. Although this move does not clear any full row immediately, it is a valid placement that obeys the game rules.\n \nAnswer: 7 0","Based on the board’s lower rows and the fact that row8 and row9 have a wide “landing area” in columns 7–10, one good strategy is to use the 0° rotation (whose block cells are placed as two on the top row and two on the row underneath, with the filled cells at positions (0,0), (1,0) on the top row and (1,1), (2,1) on the second row relative to the block’s bounding box). In this orientation the block’s bounding box is 3 columns wide. (Remember that the drop coordinate tells us the column where the leftmost column of the block’s 3‑column box will appear.) \n\nAfter examining several possibilities, one promising move is to drop the block in the 0° orientation with its leftmost column at column 8. In that case the block’s filled cells will be placed (when the block “falls” as far as possible) as follows:\n• The top row of the block (landing at board row8) will fill board cells at columns 8 and 9.\n• The bottom row of the block (landing at board row9) will fill board cells at columns 9 and 10.\nWhen simulated, the block falls to the very lowest legal position (with its top row coming in at row8, because trying to drop one row further would have caused a collision in row9) and does not interfere with the existing squares in row8 (which already has asterisks in columns 1–6) or in row9.\n\nThus, the resulting action is to drop the block with drop coordinate 8 and a rotation angle of 0°.\n\nAnswer: 8 0","I'll choose to use the 0° rotation and drop it so that the left‐most square of its 3‑wide bounding box lands in column 3. In this rotation the piece’s cells (using a 0-indexed relative grid) are at positions (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), and (1,2). Dropping at column 3 (that is, “Answer: 3 0”) lets the block fall until its lower row (covering board columns 3–5) comes to rest on row 6 (with the upper cell in row 5) without colliding with any fixed blocks. Although no full row is completed in the process, it is a safe valid move that follows the rules.\n\nAnswer: 3 0","After analyzing the board and the falling block’s two possible rotations, I chose to use the 90° rotation. In this rotation the block’s “footprint” is as follows (using (r,c) for row and column positions relative to the block’s top‐left corner):\n\n  (0,0)   \n  (1,0) and (1,1)   \n  (2,1)\n\nIf we drop the block with its leftmost column aligned to column 3 of the board, the block’s occupied cells will fall into board cells (using the board’s row numbering from top [row 1] to bottom [row 10]). Simulating its fall shows that the block will descend until its top‐left corner is at row 3. That places the block’s cells at positions:\n• (3,3)\n• (4,3) and (4,4)\n• (5,4)\n\nI have checked that these cells are free (i.e. they are “.” in the board) and that dropping the block any further would cause a collision with the already placed blocks. Therefore, placing the block in rotation 90 with its leftmost (top‐left of its bounding box) at column 3 is valid.\n\nAnswer: 3 90","I'll choose to take advantage of the board “surface” so that the falling line‐piece lands as low as possible. Note that using the horizontal configuration (0° or 180°) will “span” four consecutive columns in one row. By “reading” the board from the top (row 1) downwards in each column we can compute the landing row for each possible drop coordinate (the left‐most column) as the one immediately above the first block to appear:\n \nFor example, when dropping the block horizontally at column 7 the piece would cover columns 7, 8, 9 and 10. Looking at the board:\n • In column 7 the first block appears in row 9.\n • In column 8 it appears in row 8.\n • In column 9 it appears in row 8.\n • In column 10 it appears in row 9.\nSo the “support” is given by the highest (smallest row number) block among those—in this case row 8. That lets the block fall so that its row is 8 – 1 = 7. (A similar outcome would occur, for instance, if we dropped the block horizontally at column 6.) \n \nBecause our objective is to keep our board as “settled” as possible and not jeopardize our future moves, I choose to drop the block using 0° rotation (horizontal orientation) at drop coordinate 7. This places the four‐square line so that its leftmost square is in column 7. When it “lands” in row 7 it will stack firmly on top of already‑placed pieces and won’t raise the block structure too high.\n \nTherefore, my selected move is:\nAnswer: 7 0","Based on my analysis, one safe and reasonable placement is to use the 180° rotation. In that rotation the piece’s shape is\n\n  Row 1: ***  \n  Row 2: *00\n\nwhich (when “dropped”) occupies a 3‐wide area in which the top row covers three contiguous columns and the second row places a block only in the leftmost of that group. Choosing a drop coordinate of 8 means that the piece spans board columns 8, 9, and 10. By “dropping” the block from above the board it will descend until its occupied cells first meet an already–filled square or the board bottom. A simulation shows that if the piece lands with its upper “row” on board row 5 (so that its lower cell goes to row 6), then all four cells fall into empty cells (for row 5, columns 8–10 are empty, and for row 6 column 8 is empty). This avoids any collision while remaining safely within the board bounds.\n\nThus, the move that I choose is to drop the block with rotation 180° at a leftmost (drop) coordinate of 8.\n\nAnswer: 8 180","Based on the board’s current configuration and the falling block’s rotations, one valid strategy is to use the 90° rotation. In that orientation the block looks like:\n\n Row0: [* 0]  \n Row1: [* *]  \n Row2: [0 *]\n\nThis gives filled cells at offsets (0,0), (1,0), (1,1) and (2,1). If you choose a drop coordinate of 1 then the block’s bounding box will cover columns 1–2. When dropped it will “fall” until the cell that would otherwise overlap an already‐occupied square prevents further descent. In our simulation the piece can safely drop so that its top cell lands in row5 (occupying rows 5 to 7) without colliding with the existing blocks. (For example, if you try to drop it any lower, the cell coming to occupy row8, column 2, would hit an already–filled square.) \n\nThus, a valid move is to use the 90° rotation and drop the piece such that its leftmost column is column 1.\n\nAnswer: 1 90","I'll choose to drop the current block unrotated (i.e. 0°) at the far‐left column. When using the 0° orientation, the block is a horizontal line “****”. Dropping it with its leftmost square in column 1 causes the piece to fall until the row below (row 3, where column 3 is already occupied) prevents a further drop. Thus the block comes to rest in row 2, occupying columns 1 through 4 – a safe move even though it doesn’t clear any row.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","Based on the current board and block details, a safe and promising move is to use the vertical orientation (90°) of the “I”‐block and drop it in column 6. In this placement the block will fall down as far as possible in column 6 (since that column remains free at least until row7) and will come to rest with its bottom cell immediately above an occupied cell in row8. This avoids any overrunning of the top boundary and places the block in a relatively low position.\n\nAnswer: 6 90","After analyzing the board we see that using the vertical orientation (which is the same for 90° and 270°) can let the block fall as low as possible in column 7. In this column the highest occupied square is in row 7 so the new vertical block would have its bottom square land on row 6 (occupying rows 3–6). This is preferable compared to a horizontal drop that would land much higher (for instance, a horizontal drop at column 7 would land at row 4). Placing the block vertically in column 7 avoids the risk of immediate game over (by not overlapping the top boundary) while helping to consolidate the blocks at a lower level.\n\nAnswer: 7 90","I'll choose to drop the block without rotating it (using the 0° horizontal shape) in such a way that it lands in row2. In this move the block’s four contiguous cells (the horizontal line \"****\") will land on row2 with its leftmost square in column 5. In row2 the board already has stars in columns 1–4, and columns 5–10 are empty. As the block falls from the top it passes safely through row1 and row2; however when it would move into row3 the block would collide (for example, row3 column 7 already has a '*'). Therefore the block comes to rest in row2, filling columns 5–8. (After the drop row2 becomes \"********..\" but does not yet clear since two cells remain empty.)\n\nAnswer: 5 0","I analyzed the board and piece positions. Notice that the board’s far‐right columns (columns 9 and 10) have plenty of empty spots in the upper rows while the fifth row already has blocks there. This observation suggests that placing the falling piece near the right boundary will let it fall a little before colliding—avoiding any premature game over—and also help “fit” into the gaps without overlapping the pre‐placed blocks.\n\nI looked at the 90° rotation of the current block:\n • In 90° the block is represented as:\n  Row1: *0  → star at left cell\n  Row2: *0  → star at left cell\n  Row3: **  → stars in both cells\nThis gives a block of width = 2 and height = 3. Its occupied squares (relative to the top–left of its bounding box) are at:\n (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) and (2,1).\n\nChoosing the drop coordinate to be 9 means that the leftmost column of the block (i.e. its column 1 in the rotated shape) will align with board column 9. Then the block’s cells will be placed in columns 9 and 10. When simulating its fall:\n • If its top–left corner comes to rest at row 2, its cells would occupy board positions:\n  – Row2, col9 from (0,0)\n  – Row3, col9 from (1,0)\n  – Row4, col9 and col10 from (2,0) and (2,1)\nLooking at the board:\n • Row2 (\"********..\") has columns 9–10 free.\n • Row3 (\"..*...*...\") has columns 9–10 free.\n • Row4 (\"..**.**...\") has columns 9–10 free.\nIf we attempted to let it fall farther (to row 3 for the top–left), the block’s bottom row (row5) would hit the filled cells in row5 (\"*..*******\") in columns 9–10. That collision naturally stops the fall with the top–left at row2.\nThis placement is valid and does not cause the block to exceed the top boundary.\n\nThus, by choosing a drop coordinate of 9 and a rotation of 90°, we have placed the piece safely on the board. \n\nAnswer: 9 90","","","","","Based on my analysis, the only move that minimally “fits” without further computation is to try and use the 270° rotation with the left‐most column set at 9.

(That is, its “filled” cells end up in column 10 on the first row, in columns 9 and 10 on the second, and in column 10 on the third.)

This placement keeps the piece entirely on the board and lets it fall unobstructed to the bottom.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","I'll choose to use the 0° rotation and drop the block so that its leftmost filled square lands in column 2. In the 0° shape the filled cells are:\n\n  Row0: [0,1,2] → only positions 1 and 2 are filled  \n  Row1: [0,1,2] → only positions 0 and 1 are filled\n\nWhen we define the drop coordinate to mean that the filled cell at position (row1, col0) lands at the specified column (here column 2), the other filled cells will be at:\n  Row0: columns 3 (2+1) and 4 (2+2)\n  Row1: columns 2 and 3  \n\nIn our board the only obstacles are in row9 (a star at column 5) and in row10 (stars at columns 4, 5, and 6). With drop coordinate 2 the block falls unobstructed until its bottom row becomes row10. Then its final positions are:\n  Row9: columns 3 and 4 (which do not conflict with the star at column 5)\n  Row10: columns 2 and 3 (which do not conflict with the stars at columns 4, 5, 6).\n\nThus, this move is valid and safe.\n\nAnswer: 2 0","Based on the board after three rounds, here’s a valid strategy:\n\nWe want to avoid any collisions with the existing pieces, which are in rows 9 and 10. One good option is to use the block’s 0° rotation. In this orientation the block’s pattern is\n\n  Row1: 0 * 0   (meaning only the middle square is filled)\n  Row2: * * *   (all three squares are filled)\n\nIf we drop it so that its leftmost square appears in column 8 the block will cover columns 8–10. When it falls, its bottom row (the fully filled row “***”) will land on row 10 and the top row (“0*0”) will be on row 9. Checking the board:\n • Row 9 currently has stars in columns 3–5; adding a star at column 9 (from the “*” in “0*0”) does not conflict.\n • Row 10 has stars in columns 2–6; filling columns 8–10 with the block’s “***” is also conflict‐free.\nThis placement lets the block drop as far as possible without overlapping existing blocks.\n\nThus the move “drop column 8 with no rotation (0°)” is both valid and safe.\n\nAnswer: 8 0","I analyzed the board and “dropped” the block in simulation. In rotation 90° the block’s 3‐row, 2‐column shape (with filled cells at positions (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) and (2,0)) will be able to settle as low as possible if dropped so that its bottom row (which contributes one square) reaches row 10. By choosing a drop coordinate of 7, the block’s squares land as follows when its top is at row 8:\n • Square A (from the (0,1) cell) goes to (8,8);\n • Squares B and C (from cells (1,0) and (1,1)) go to row 9 at columns 7 and 8 respectively;\n • Square D (from cell (2,0)) goes to (10,7).\n\nThis move fills the gap at row 10, column 7 (one of the two holes in that row) while avoiding any overlap with existing blocks. It is a safe, legal placement that brings the block down maximally without ending the round.\n\nAnswer: 7 90","Based on the board configuration we have at epoch 5 and noticing that the bottom‐row (row10) is nearly full except for the first column, a smart move is to try to “fill” that gap. Looking at the rotations, the 90° state of the current block has four filled cells with coordinates (relative to its own top‐left) given by:\n  (0,1)\n  (1,0)\n  (1,1)\n  (2,0)\n\nWith the board columns numbered 1 to 10 (and using the rule that the drop coordinate is the board column where the bounding box’s left edge is aligned), if we choose a drop coordinate of 1 then the filled cells will map to:\n  Row R: column 2  (from (0,1))\n  Row R+1: columns 1 and 2  (from (1,0) and (1,1))\n  Row R+2: column 1  (from (2,0))\n\nNow, working from the top down we want the falling block to “land” as low as possible without collision. In this board, rows 1–7 are empty. Checking row8 through row10:\n • With the top-left of the block placed at row8, the cells would be placed in:\n  • Row8, col2 [empty on board]\n  • Row9, cols1–2 [row9 originally has “..***.***.” so cols1–2 are empty]\n  • Row10, col1 [row10 is “.*********”, so col1 is the only gap]\nThis placement is valid. Moreover, because the block’s filled cell in Row10 (col1) will complete row10 (since the rest of row10 already has blocks in cols2–10) the full row will be cleared and the score will increase.\n\nThus the best move is to drop the block with its 90° rotation at drop coordinate 1.\n\nAnswer: 1 90","After analyzing the board and the block’s two unique shapes, I decided to use the 90° rotation. In this rotation the block’s bounding box is 2 columns wide and 3 rows tall, with its occupied cells (relative to the top‐left of the block) at:\n • (0,1)\n • (1,0)\n • (1,1)\n • (2,0)\n\nI then looked at which landing position might benefit the board. In the bottom row (row 10) the gaps are at column 6 and column 10. Although we cannot fill an entire row with this one block, we can place it so that one of its cells fills the gap at column 6. By choosing a drop coordinate X = 6 for the 90° rotation, the falling block’s cells will eventually land as follows:\n • Its cell at (0,1) lands at (8,7)\n • Its cells at (1,0) and (1,1) land at (9,6) and (9,7)\n • Its cell at (2,0) lands at (10,6)\n\nDuring its drop, the piece falls until the lowest row is row 10 (the floor). The simulation shows that at top‐left placement row R = 8 the block does not overlap any existing squares (the only blocks on the board are in row 9 at columns 2 and 8 and row 10 at columns 1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9). With this drop, the block will be placed legally and (while it does not clear an entire row) continues the game safely.\n\nThus, the recommended action is:\n\nAnswer: 6 90","I analyzed the board and block. In this state the board’s bottom row is almost full (\"*********.\") missing only column 10. By dropping a vertical block (either 90° or 270° rotation gives the same shape) in column 10 the piece will fall so that its lowest square occupies row10 at column10. This fills the gap in the bottom row, causing it to clear (scoring an extra point). Choosing the vertical block rotated 90° – with the drop coordinate given as the leftmost (and only) column of the block – the best move is to drop in column 10 with a 90° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 10 90","I examined the board and the current block (an I‐piece that can be placed either horizontally or vertically). One safe strategy is simply to let the horizontal block (0° rotation) fall so that it lands on the open area near the left side without interfering with any existing blocks. In this case, if we choose a drop coordinate of 1, the piece (which covers columns 1–4 when horizontal) will fall until it stops at row 9 (since row 10, column 2 is already occupied) and settle safely without immediately causing a game‐ending collision.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","Based on evaluating the board and the four rotational options, one simple valid strategy is to use the 0° rotation. In that rotation the block’s pattern is\n\n  Row1: * 0 0  \n  Row2: * * *\n\nIf we choose drop coordinate 5 then the block’s three‐wide shape will be aligned with board columns 5–7. Dropping the piece in 0° will let its bottom row (the three stars) come to rest on row 8 (with row 7 occupied by the single star from the top row of the piece)—since attempting a lower placement would result in a collision (for instance, row 9 already has a block at column 7). This placement fits safely in the play area without forcing a game over and avoids an immediate collision.\n\nThus, the chosen action is to drop the current block in the 0° rotation with its leftmost square in column 5.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","After analyzing the board, I noticed that the 2×2 square (which is the same under any rotation) can be dropped at various horizontal positions. In order to let the block fall as far as possible (and because a lower landing is generally preferable), I computed the “landing row” for each valid drop coordinate. In brief, for any candidate drop column (where the leftmost cell of the block is placed), we find the first occupied cell (or the “virtual floor” set at row 10 if no block is there) in each of the two columns that the 2×2 occupies. The piece then comes to rest with its bottom row one row above that lowest obstacle (i.e. landing row = min(first obstacle in the two columns) – 1, so that its top is two rows above that obstacle).\n\nFor example, when dropping with the leftmost coordinate at column 8 (i.e. using columns 7 and 8 in 0-indexed terms), we see that:\n• In column 7 the first occupied cell is at row 9.\n• In column 8 there is no block until the virtual floor (row 10).\nThus the block lands as soon as one of the squares would hit row 9. Following the calculation, the 2×2 lands with its top in row 7 (using 0-indexing) and bottom in row 8. Compared with other possible placements, this results in the block settling as low on the board as possible. (Since the block is square its rotation does not change its shape.) \n\nThus, the best move is to drop the block so that the leftmost square is in column 8 (remembering that the board coordinates are 1-indexed) and use a rotation angle of 0°.\n\nAnswer: 8 0","Considering the board‐situation and aiming to avoid any immediate collisions while letting the tetromino settle safely, one viable plan is to use the 0° rotation. In this rotation the block appears as:\n  Row 1: “00*”    (only the third cell is filled)\n  Row 2: “***”   (all three cells are filled)\n\nIf we choose a drop coordinate of 1 then the “leftmost” of the block’s three columns is aligned with column 1 of the board. (The block’s filled squares will be in column 3 on its top row and in columns 1–3 on its bottom row.)\n\nA step‐by‐step simulation shows that if we let the block fall it will come to rest with its top row appearing in board row 7. At that landing:\n • The top row of the block occupies board row 7 at column 3. (Row 7 is “....*.....” so column 3 is free.)\n • The bottom row occupies board row 8 at columns 1, 2, and 3. In row 8 (“....******”), the first four columns are empty, so these placements are safe.\nA drop one row lower would cause a collision in row 9 (as that row already has blocks in columns 1–4). Therefore, placing the block with drop coordinate 1 and rotation 0° is both legal and avoids collisions.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","Based on the board’s current obstacles – with many stars already in rows 7–10 – the falling block cannot descend very far without colliding. Noticing that for rotations with a two‐row height (such as the 0° rotation) the block will come to rest just above row 7, a very safe option is to use the 0° rotation and drop the block so its leftmost square is in column 1. In that configuration, the block will fall until its bottom row (the three contiguous occupied squares) lands in row 6. (If it were to fall one row lower, part of its lower row would hit an already occupied star in row 7.) This placement minimizes immediate collision and is a legal move.\n\nThus, one acceptable solution command is:\n\nAnswer: 1 0","Based on our simulation, a promising move is to use the 0° rotation and drop the block with its leftmost square in column 4. In that rotation the block’s shape is:\n  Row1: 00*  (corresponds to a block square in the third column of its 3‐column width)\n  Row2: ***  (corresponds to block squares in all three columns)\n\nPlacing its leftmost square at column 4 means its three columns will occupy columns 4, 5, and 6 on the board. Allowing the block to fall, we find that if it drops too far it would collide (for example, if its lower row were to land in row 7 the cell at column 5 would hit an existing “*”). The maximum drop obtained without collision is when the block’s top row lands at row 5 and its bottom row lands at row 6. That placement does not exceed the top boundary and leaves the board in a valid state.\n\nThus, the chosen action is to drop the block at column 4 with the 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","I’ve analyzed the board and simulated one possible safe placement. In the 0° rotation the block is 2 rows tall and 3 columns wide with its filled squares at local positions (0,2) and (0,3) on the top row and (1,1) and (1,2) on the bottom row when imagining the “0” cells are empty. If we drop the block with its leftmost square at column 7 using the 0° rotation, the falling piece will slide until its filled parts land without overlapping any '*' on the board. In our simulation the piece comes to rest with its top row landing in row 6 and its bottom row in row 7. Checking against the board shows that all four filled locations end up in previously empty cells so that no collision occurs and the piece is safely placed.\n\nAnswer: 7 0","","I analyzed the board and considered several rotations and horizontal placements. One valid move is to use the block with no rotation (0°) and drop it so that its leftmost square lands in column 4. In the 0° rotation the block’s shape is\n\n  Row1: 00*  (only the third square is occupied)  \n  Row2: ***  (all three squares are occupied)\n\nWhen dropping this piece with leftmost coordinate 4, the block will fall until its bottom row lands on row 4 (so that when it would try to go any lower the square in row 5 at column 6 would cause a collision with an already occupied board square). With that landing position the piece fits safely without overlapping any occupied square and does not exceed the top boundary. (Other placements might be possible, but this move clearly avoids immediate collision and game over.)\n\nAnswer: 4 0","I have analyzed the board and considered both horizontal (0°\/180°) and vertical (90°\/270°) placements. Most of the lower rows are already partly filled so that if you try to drop a horizontal block it would immediately collide with already‐placed pieces. Similarly, all vertical placements would have at least one cell overlapped by an existing block when the piece “lands” on the current surface.\n\nA simple valid solution is to “stall” the fall as high as possible so that no overlaps occur. For example, if you use the horizontal orientation (0°) with a drop coordinate of 4 the block will fall from above. As it descends it will try to go one row lower but in row3 the sixth column already contains a block (in the board’s “.....*....” row). Therefore it stops one row higher – landing in row2. Row2 is completely empty so the four‐cell block placed at columns 4–7 in row2 does not overlap any existing block and the placement is legal (even though it leaves you with a high stack).\n\nThus one valid action is:\n\nAnswer: 4 0","I'll choose to drop the 2×2 block in the far‐left position (drop coordinate 1) with no rotation (0°). In this placement the falling block moves down until its bottom would hit an existing star. A step‐by‐step simulation shows that with drop coordinate 1 the block can fall safely so that its top‐left square ends up in row 3 (occupying rows 3 and 4, columns 1–2) without any collision. This move is legal and may pave the way for future clears. \n\nAnswer: 1 0","After analyzing the board, I determined that when dropping the 2×2 square —the current block is invariant under rotation—the only valid drop positions are those where both of the two columns the block would occupy have enough “room” to let the block fall completely into the board (so that the top cell lands at row ≥1). By “projecting” the board in each column we see that columns 1–2 (or 2–3) only let the block fall as far as row2 (making its top cell row1), while columns 8–9 and 9–10 allow the block to settle much lower (with the bottom cell landing in row5 and the top in row4). In Tetris keeping the stack as low as possible is generally better. Although a completion (line clear) is ideal, none of the placements lead to an immediate full row; however, placing the new block lower is preferable. Hence dropping the block in columns 8–9 (with drop coordinate 8) using 0° rotation is a good choice.\n\nAnswer: 8 0","I'll choose to use the 0° rotation (which has the piece shape\n\n  Row1: 0 **    (i.e. the right two cells are “filled”)  \n  Row2: ** 0    (i.e. the left two cells are “filled”)\n\nso that when “dropped” with its leftmost column in column 2 the piece will fall until it just “locks” in place without colliding with already‐filled squares. In this scenario the piece’s cells end up occupying board cells (row1, columns 3–4) and (row2, columns 2–3). A brief “gravity simulation” shows that placing the block in any lower row would cause one of its cells to impinge on an already filled cell. Hence, “drop_coordinate = 2” and “rotation_angle = 0” is a legal move that avoids collision.\n\nAnswer: 2 0","I'll choose to rotate the falling block by 180° and drop it so that the block’s bounding box’s leftmost square lands in column 8. This placement lets the block fall to a level where its three‐cell top row lands in an open row (row 3) while its single cell in the bottom row safely occupies an empty cell in row 4. (A quick simulation: with the 180° shape, the block’s cells are arranged as \n  Row0: • • •\n  Row1: 0 0 •\nso if dropped with drop coordinate 8 the cells become placed at row3 for columns 8–10 and at row4 in column10. Checking the board shows that these cells fall into empty spots and that moving one row further would cause a collision.) \n\nAnswer: 8 180","I propose to use the 270° rotation and drop the block so that its bounding box’s left‐edge lands in column 2. In that orientation the “occupied” cells are, from the block grid, at positions (row1, col2), (row2, col2), and (row3, col1–col2). When we drop it with its top row eventually resting on board row 3 (so that the lowest row is row 5), none of the four block cells overlap an already occupied square on the board. (For example, the block cell that lands in board row 5, column 2 and the one in row 5, column 3 are placed into originally empty positions.) \n\nThus, one valid move is to select drop coordinate 2 with a rotation of 270°.\n\nAnswer: 2 270"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

This automatically clears the row and increments the score by 1.\n\nThus, by choosing the 270° rotation and dropping the block with its leftmost square in column 9, we not only place the block without causing any collision issues with the current blocks but also cause a line clear.\n\nAnswer: 9 270","I analyzed the board and noted that the current 2×2 block is identical in every rotation. Since there is no way for the block to clear an entire row at this stage (because even with any placement neither row 9 nor row 10 can be completely filled), a safe action is simply to drop the block in the far left column (position 1) with the 0° orientation. This guarantees that the block will settle onto the board without causing an immediate game‐over or unexpected collisions.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","I'll choose to use the 90° orientation and drop the block so that after falling its bottom cell lands exactly in the 10th row. With this rotation the block’s pattern is\n\n Row0: 0*\n Row1: **\n Row2: *0\n\nWhen we drop the block with its leftmost square in column 8 we obtain:\n• The block’s cells will be at\n – Row8, column 9 (from the first row of the block),\n – Row9, columns 8 and 9 (from the second row),\n – Row10, column 8 (from the third row).\nChecking against the board:\n• Row8 is empty.\n• Row9 originally has pieces in columns 1, 2, and 10 so placing cells at columns 8 and 9 is safe.\n• Row10 originally has pieces in columns 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10 so filling column 8 poses no collision.\nThis move is valid and allows the block to drop to its maximum height without any overlap.\n\nAnswer: 8 90","I'll choose to rotate the block in its 0° orientation. In that configuration the block looks like:\n\n  Row1: 0 * *  \n  Row2: * * 0\n\nSo the block’s squares occur at positions (relative to the block’s leftmost column):\n • Top row: columns 2 and 3  \n • Bottom row: columns 1 and 2\n\nLooking at the board, note that the bottom row (row 10) is \"**..******\". It is almost complete but lacks stars at columns 3 and 4. If we drop the block in the 0° orientation with its leftmost square landing in column 3, then its bottom row squares will fall into columns 3 and 4 of row 10. This will complete row 10, triggering a line-clear and boosting the score.\n\nSimultaneously, the top row of the block will fall into row 9 at columns 4 and 5, which are clear in row 9 (\"**.....***\").\n\nThus, the move is valid and strategically beneficial.\n\nAnswer: 3 0","I'll choose to drop the block in its 0° orientation with the leftmost block square placed in column 5. In this placement the block falls so that its bottom row lands on row 10, where the block’s occupied cells cover columns 6 and 7. Although row 10 already has a filled pattern in columns 1,2,4,5,8,9,10 and a gap at column 3, filling columns 6 and 7 still produces a legal move and increases stability for future rounds. \n\nAnswer: 5 0","I'll choose to drop the 2×2 block starting at column 3 with no rotation (0°) – knowing that the square’s orientation is independent of rotation.\n\nExplanation:\n• The board is 10 columns wide and the current block is a 2×2 square. In any rotation the block is the same.\n• With drop coordinate 3, the block covers columns 3 and 4.\n• If dropped, the block will fall until its bottom squares reach row 9 (because moving further would have its bottom row entering row 10 where a collision occurs in column 4).\n• This placement is legal (no overlapping with existing block pieces) and does not cause the game to end.\n• Although no complete row will be cleared by this move, it’s a safe and valid play.\n\nAnswer: 3 0","I analyzed the board and noticed that placing the block with no rotation (the “0°” orientation) allows us to use the two‐row × three‐column pattern:\n • In 0°, the pattern is:\n  Row1: [0, ★, ★]\n  Row2: [★, ★, 0]\n\nI then looked for a column placement where the falling block—whose “leftmost column” will align with the chosen drop coordinate—can drop without colliding with existing blocks. Testing possible placements when the piece “lands” with its bottom row on one row above the bottom (row9) showed that certain columns would “collide” with already occupied positions (for instance, near columns 1–6). However, when I considered placing the block with its leftmost column at column 7, the star cells of the block would fill these board positions:\n • Top row (relative row 0) would occupy board positions (row8, column8) and (row8, column9).\n • Bottom row (relative row 1) would occupy board positions (row9, column7) and (row9, column8).\n\nChecking the current board:\n • Row8 is “..**......” (stars only in columns 3–4) so columns 8–9 are empty.\n • Row9 is “..****..*.” (with stars in columns 3–6 and 9) leaving columns 7 and 8 free.\nThus, there is no conflict and the block lands safely. \n\nFollowing the required format, my final action is:\n\nAnswer: 7 0","Based on the board state, the best move is to drop the 2×2 square block into the leftmost columns. By selecting drop coordinate 1 with a 0° rotation, the block will descend as far as possible without colliding. (In this case, the block lands with its top‐left cell at row 8 and covers rows 8 and 9 in columns 1 and 2. Although neither row is fully cleared, this placement avoids premature stacking and clears the way for future moves.)\n\nAnswer: 1 0","Based on the board, a safe and reasonable move is to use the block’s 0° rotation and drop it so that its left edge is at column 5. In the 0° rotation the block looks like this:\n\n  Row1: 0 * 0  \n  Row2: * * *  \n\nWhen dropped at column 5 the piece falls until its bottom row lands on row 8 – note that rows 1–7 are completely empty and row 8 (“****...**.”) has three consecutive empty spots at columns 5–7. With the 0° rotation at drop coordinate 5 the second row of the block fills columns 5, 6, and 7 on its landing row; the top row (with its single block at column 6) lands one row above (row 7). This placement is legal (no collisions occur) and leaves the board in a stable configuration. (Although row clearing is possible when an entire row becomes fully occupied, no clear occurs in the final resting positions in this move.) \n\nThus the chosen action is:\n\nAnswer: 5 0","I analyzed the board and the falling piece’s possible orientations. One legal move is to drop the block using its 0° rotation. In that rotation the piece appears as follows:\n  Row1: “00*” (only the third cell is filled)\n  Row2: “***” (all three cells filled)\nIf we choose the drop coordinate so that the leftmost column of the piece is column 8, then when it falls under gravity the piece will “land” on the board with its top row on row 6 and the bottom row on row 7. (Any further descent is prevented by the filled cells in row 8.) In this placement none of the piece’s cells overlap an already–filled grid square and the move is legal.\n\nThus, a valid action is to drop the block with its 0° rotation at drop coordinate 8.\n\nAnswer: 8 0","I analyzed the board and determined that using the 0° rotation (which has cells at relative positions (0,1), (0,2) and (1,0), (1,1) in a 2‐row×3‐column bounding box) is viable. Setting the drop coordinate as 3 (meaning the leftmost column of the block is aligned with board column 3) makes the falling piece “land” with its top‐left cell at row 5. In that landing position the block’s four cells go to:\n• Row 5, columns 3 and 4\n• Row 6, columns 2 and 3\nI checked that these cells fall into empty spaces (given the board, row 5 is “.........*” and row 6 is “.....*.***”) and that further descent would cause a collision, so the piece stops here. This move does not fill an entire row but is the only collision–free drop we could find.\n\nAnswer: 3 0","My analysis determined that the best move is to drop the unrotated 2×2 block in the far left columns. When dropped with its leftmost square in column 1 (drop coordinate 1) in the 0° rotation, the block will settle in rows 6 and 7. In these columns, rows 6 and 7 are empty while a drop one row further would cause the block’s bottom to enter row 8—which is already occupied in column 1 by a block from an earlier drop. This placement makes optimal use of the available space and avoids premature stacking high on the board.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","I'll choose to use the vertical “I” (rotated 90°) so that it drops in column 7. In that column the first block already on the board is at row 8 so the vertical I‐piece will “fall” further – landing with its bottom square in row 7 (occupying rows 4–7 in column 7). This placement is lower than any horizontal option (which would land in row 5 or 6) and so maximizes use of the available space. There is no immediate clear (no row is completely filled by adding the 4 blocks) but by dropping it as low as possible, it keeps the board’s build-up lower.\n\nAnswer: 7 90","I analyzed each possible horizontal placement of the 2×2 “square‐block” (which is identical in every rotation) to see how far it falls before colliding with any existing placed blocks. In many columns the block can only fall a few rows, but column 8 (meaning the block covers columns 8 and 9) lets the block drop farther – it falls until its bottom is in row 6. (For example, at drop coordinate 8 the block drops until row 5 becomes its top row and row 6 its bottom; trying to drop one more row would result in one of the block’s cells meeting a preexisting star in row 7.) Although the block’s placement does not complete any full rows right away, choosing drop coordinate 8 with a 0° rotation makes use of the deepest possible landing for the piece given the configuration.\n\nAnswer: 8 0","I'll choose to drop the piece without rotation (0°) and with its leftmost square over column 3. In this configuration the block (in the 0° orientation) appears as\n\n  Row0: 0**\n  Row1: **0\n\nso its occupied squares (relative to the leftmost square) lie in the columns (drop_coordinate+1) and (drop_coordinate+2) in its top row and in (drop_coordinate) and (drop_coordinate+1) in its bottom row. With drop_coordinate = 3 the piece “falls” and – after simulating its descent – lands so that it does not overlap any already-stationary blocks. (A simulation of several drop positions shows that if we try for a further descent, one of the block’s squares would hit an already placed block.) \n\nThus my answer is to use drop coordinate 3 with 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 3 0","I'll choose to use the 0° orientation and drop the block so its left‐most square is in column 1. In 0° the block looks like\n\n  Row0: *00  \n  Row1: ***\n\nWhen dropped at column 1 the block falls until a “collision” prevents further descent. In this case it lands with its top row at row 3 and its bottom row at row 4. (The limit comes from column 3 because row5 already holds a block there.) Checking the landing:\n • In column 1 the block’s cells would go to board cells (3,1) and (4,1). The first obstacle in column 1 is at row6.\n • In column 2 the only block cell is at (4,2) and row6 already has a block there.\n • In column 3 the only block cell is at (4,3) and row5 already contains a block.\nThus the piece can descend no further than with its top row at row 3 without overlapping existing blocks.\n\nSo the valid move is to drop at column 1 with 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","Based on our analysis we want to “sink” the new block as far down as possible so that it does not pile up too high. Examining each column’s “clear height” (the number of empty cells from the top until an already‐placed block appears) shows that Column 6 is particularly favorable. In Column 6 the board is empty from row 1 through row 6 (with row 7 already occupied), so if we drop the vertical “line” block (rotated 90° or 270°) in that column it will fall until its bottom cell reaches row 6. (Recall the falling process: the piece drops one row at a time until a move further down would have even one of its cells overlap an existing block.) In our simulation a vertical piece dropped in column 6 lands with its four cells in rows 3, 4, 5, and 6. Although this move does not immediately clear any row, it is a legal placement that puts the newest block as low as possible without any overlapping, keeping the “well” clean for later rounds.\n\nThus one correct action is to drop the block with its vertical orientation (e.g. 90°) into column 6.\n\nAnswer: 6 90","I'll drop the block in its 0° orientation so that its bottom row – which is three consecutive squares “***” – lands exactly in row 4 filling the empty columns 8, 9, and 10. With the leftmost square aligned with column 8 (thus the piece covers columns 8–10), the block’s bottom row will settle in row 4, completing that nearly filled row (which already has “*******” in columns 1–7) and triggering a line clearance. The top row of the block (“*00”) then lands in row 3, and since there’s no collision there the move is valid.\n\nThus my action is to drop the piece at column 8 in the 0° orientation.\n\nAnswer: 8 0","I'll choose to drop the block in its 0° (unrotated) state at drop coordinate 1. In this orientation the block’s shape is\n\n  Row1: **0   (meaning two block squares at the left, then an empty cell)\n  Row2: 0**   (an empty cell then two block squares)\n\nWhen dropped with its leftmost square over column 1 it falls until one of its parts meets a filled square. In this case the first collision occurs when the block tries to descend past row 3 (its top‐left cell would move from row 3 to row 4 in column 1 – but row 4 already has a “*” in column 1), so it stops with its top–left at row 3. Its resulting squares end up at board coordinates:\n  (3,1) and (3,2) from row 1 of the block,\n  (4,2) and (4,3) from row 2 of the block.\nNone of these cause an overlap with the existing board pieces.\n\nThus, the chosen move is to drop at coordinate 1 with 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","I'll choose to keep things safe and avoid any collisions. Because the lower part of the board is very tight (with only one‐cell gaps that our 3‐cell blocks can’t fill without overlapping an already‑occupied cell), a cautious approach is to drop the current block into the completely empty top two rows. In the 0° rotation the block’s “0*0” top row means only its center cell is active, and its bottom row “***” occupies three consecutive columns. By dropping it with its leftmost cell in column 1, the block falls until it is stopped by the collision against the filled cells below—this “floating” placement will occur in the top region rather than causing an accidental collision.\n\nThus, the safest legal move is to choose drop coordinate 1 with 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","I'll choose to drop the block with its original 0° rotation from column 5. In this placement the block (with its two‐row by three‐column bounding box, having block squares at the top row’s left two cells and the bottom row’s right two cells) will fall and come to rest without colliding with any existing blocks. (In a quick simulation, when dropped at column 5 the piece falls all the way so that its top row ends on board row 2 and its bottom row lands on row 3. Checking the board there, row 2 (which initially reads \"***.......\") has its cells at columns 5 and 6 empty and row 3 (\"**........\") has columns 6 and 7 empty, so the block can be safely placed.) \n\nAnswer: 5 0","Based on analyzing the board and the tetromino shapes available (the so‐called “I” piece, which can be played either horizontally or vertically), one viable, safe option is to drop the tetromino using its 0° (horizontal) configuration so that it lands entirely in an empty row. For instance, if we choose drop_coordinate = 3 (meaning that the leftmost block will be in column 3), then the four-block horizontal tetromino will come to rest in row 1 (because columns 3–6 “see” their highest obstructions very low in the board, forcing the falling block to stop at the top row). Checking row 1 (“.*........”), placing the horizontal piece starting at col 3 gives:\n • col1 remains '.'\n • col2 remains '*'\n • cols3–6 become '*' from the falling block\n • cols7–10 remain '.'\nThere is no overlap with any existing block (note that row 1’s star is only in column 2) and the block does not exceed the top boundary. (Other placements are possible as well but this one is valid and safe.)\n\nAnswer: 3 0","Based on the board configuration and the fact that the current block is a 2×2 square (identical in all rotations), one good strategy is to drop the block into a gap where it will land without colliding. Looking at the board column‐by‐column, placing it so that its leftmost square is in column 4 works. In that placement the block (in its 0° rotation) will fall until its top is on row 3 and its bottom on row 4 – both rows have empty cells ('.') at columns 4 and 5. Dropping it any further would have the block encounter an existing block (for example, row 5 column 4 already has a “*”). Therefore, the move “drop at column 4 with 0° rotation” is a valid play.\n\nAnswer: 4 0"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
