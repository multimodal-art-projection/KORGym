This means careful placement is required.\n\n### Step 2: Strategy\n1. The 90° and 270° rotations of the current block provide the best option as they allow for vertical narrow placement.\n2.

A vertical placement (90° or 270° rotation) in an empty column minimizes gaps.

This is because column 4 has an open spot for the vertical layout of the block, and the two additional squares will rest cleanly on the pre-existing '***' row, reducing chances of gaps.\n\n### Final Decision:\nPlace the block with a **90° rotation**, starting at column **4** (the leftmost square of the drop starting at this column).\n\n**Answer: 4 90**"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Rotation (`rotation_angle`) can stay at 0°.\n\n3. **Objective**:\n   - Minimize gaps and maximize row completions to clear lines and increase the score.\n\n### Analysis:\nThe current game board:\n```\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n....*.....\n....**....\n.....*....\n....**....\n....*.....\n....*.....\n```\n#### Observing potential column placements:\n- The 2x2 block can fit in columns 1 through 9 (it requires 2 adjacent columns).\n- We should try to align the block so it creates complete rows or minimizes gaps.\n\n#### Best action:\n- If placed in column 5 (i.e., leftmost square aligns with column 5) and at 0° rotation:\n  ```\n  ..........\n  ..........\n  ..........\n  ..........\n  ....*.....\n  ..****....\n  .....*....\n  ....**....\n  ....*.....\n  ....*.....\n  ```\n  This creates no row completion but keeps the board's structure optimized, minimizing gaps.  \n\n### Optimal Move:\n- Drop the block at column 5 with a rotation angle of 0°.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","To solve this problem, we aim to drop the current block in a position and orientation where it fits without exceeding the board boundaries and maximizes clearing potential rows or minimizing gaps.\n\n### Analyze the Block and Game Board\n\n#### Current Block Shape:\nThe current block is shaped as follows:\n\n- 0°:  \n  0*0  \n  ***  \n\n- 90°:  \n  *0  \n  **  \n  *0  \n\n- 180°:  \n  ***  \n  0*0  \n\n- 270°:  \n  0*  \n  **  \n  0*  \n\n#### Current Board State:\nBoard:\n```\n..........\n..........\n....**....\n....**....\n....*.....\n....**....\n.....*....\n....**....\n....*.....\n....*.....\n```\n\n### Strategy\nLet's place the block to minimize gaps, prevent overflows, and prepare for potential row clears:\n\n1. **Rotation Analysis**:\n   - The 90° and 270° rotations make the block three columns tall, so using these rotations directly on a well-set surface (avoiding placement gaps) is crucial.\n   - The 0° and 180° rotations make the block one row tall, but they need a clear fit horizontally.\n\n2. **Column Placement**:\n   - Columns between 4 and 8 appear optimal for fitting the block without exceeding boundaries or creating gaps.\n\n3. **Best Fit for the Block**:\n   - 0° or 180° rotation works well for horizontal alignment without creating unnecessary gaps.\n   - Place the block around column 5, where it can snugly fit between existing blocks and extend the structure below.\n\n### Solution:\nThe block will be dropped at column 5 with a 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","To solve this problem, I need to identify an optimal placement of the current block on the given board.

Drop the leftmost square of the block at **column 4**.\n\n### Resulting Board:\nAfter dropping the block at column 4 with 0° rotation, the board becomes:\n```\n..........\n..........\n....*.....\n....***...\n....*.....\n....*.....\n....*.....\n....**....\n....****..\n*********.\n```\nThe bottom row clears, and the score increases by 1.\n\n---\n\nAnswer: 4 0","To solve this, we need to determine where the current block should drop and at what rotation angle. This depends on finding a placement that avoids overlaps and ideally clears rows. Here’s the game plan:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Board\nThe current block is a vertical or horizontal \"line\" piece (I-piece) with 4 squares occupied. Since the board is 10 columns wide, this block can fit horizontally across 4 columns or vertically in a single column.\n\nWe'll try to:\n1. Avoid overlaps (block placement must not clash with existing blocks).\n2. Place the block in a way that maximizes row clearing and shrinks the occupied region of the board.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Placement Options\n#### Horizontal Layout (0° or 180°):\n- When rotated to 0° or 180°, the block is 1 row tall.\n- Ensure the row has enough horizontal space for 4 contiguous columns.\n\n#### Vertical Layout (90° or 270°):\n- When rotated to 90° or 270°, the block is 4 rows tall.\n- Ensure that 4 consecutive rows have 1 contiguous column space.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Optimal Placement\n#### Horizontal:\nThe bottom row is already filled. Starting from row 9 upwards:\n- Row 8: Has ** space at columns 4–7.\n- Row 7: Has no horizontal gaps for 4 contiguous squares.\nThus, we can drop the block horizontally at column 4.\n\n#### Vertical:\nTo place the block vertically, we need 4 open spaces in one column:\n- Columns: Most columns are filled along the height of 4 rows. Vertical orientation doesn't work well here.\n\n### Step 4: Final Decision\nThe first horizontal placement at row 8, column 4 optimizes the placement. We'll use rotation 0° to drop the line block horizontally.\n\n### Solution:  \n**Answer: 4 0**"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Consequently, illegal placements would occur if it exceeds column 9 (so it cannot be placed at column 10).\n- A rotation is irrelevant here because all rotations produce identical shapes.\n\n### Observing the Board:\nThe lowest unobstructed placement position for the block, to avoid gaps and maximize clearing potential, is evaluated. For each possible drop position (columns 1 to 9), the block will fall until it collides with other blocks or the board's bottom.\n\nAfter analyzing, the optimal drop column for the block is **3**. It'll fill gaps and enable future blocks to fill remaining spaces effectively.\n\n### Action:\nDrop at column 3 with rotation 0°.  \n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 3 0","To solve, we analyze the board and determine the most promising column and rotation angle based on optimal fits and avoiding gaps, while clearing rows where possible.\n\n### Observations:\n\n- The current block has 4 rotation options (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°).\n- The board is already partially occupied, and the block must fit without exceeding the boundaries.\n- Priorities: fit the block without creating gaps, clear rows when possible, and maintain efficient placement for future pieces.\n\nNow examining each rotation and drop position:\n\n#### Rotation: **0°**\nBlock shape:\n```\n**0\n0**\n```\nThis means the leftmost square in this rotation occupies 2 horizontally aligned squares, followed by a diagonal block.\n\n#### Rotation: **90°**\nBlock shape:\n```\n0*\n**\n*0\n```\nThis means the block forms an inverted 'Z' shape.\n\n#### Rotation: **180°**\nIdentical to 0° due to symmetry:\n```\n**0\n0**\n```\n\n#### Rotation: **270°**\nIdentical to 90°:\n```\n0*\n**\n*0\n```\n\n### Evaluation:\nDropping the block in either 0° or 90° rotations in certain columns should prioritize efficiency. Dropping the block at column **6** with **rotation 90°** will optimally fit without gaps and prepare for row clears. Column 6 aligns the block to complement existing sections strategically to clear potential rows.\n\n### Final Solution:\n'Answer: 6 90'","To solve this problem, the goal is to place the current block with its rotations such that it lands in an optimal position while following the rules of the game. The optimal position usually means either clearing rows or keeping the board as clean as possible.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Current Block and Board**\nThe current block can appear in four possible rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°). We need to test each rotation at all possible drop coordinates (columns) to see which gives the best result.\n\nThe current board:\n```\n..........\n..........\n..........\n.....*....\n.....**...\n......*...\n..*****...\n..*****...\n...***....\n....***...\n```\n\nThe current block (`**0`, `0**`) with its rotations:\n\n0°:\n```\n**0\n0**\n```\n\n90°:\n```\n0*\n**\n*0\n```\n\n180° (same as 0°):\n```\n**0\n0**\n```\n\n270° (same as 90°):\n```\n0*\n**\n*0\n```\n\n**Step 2: Find the Best Position**\nTo evaluate each position:\n1. Place the block as low as possible in each column.\n2. Evaluate the resulting board for:\n   - Clearing rows.\n   - Minimizing stack height and gaps.\n\n**Step 3: Try Each Rotation and Placement**\nFor a preliminary evaluation:\n- The 0° and 180° rotations are functionally identical for this block, as are the 90° and 270° rotations.\n- Let's examine potential placements.\n\n### Trying the Block at Various Positions\n- With 0° rotation:\n  Places at columns 4 through 9, as the block width is 3.\n- With 90° rotation:\n  Places at columns 3 through 10, as the block width is 2.\n\nLet’s evaluate the boards for these positions.\n\n### Best Move\nPlacing the block at **column 6, 0° rotation** aligns the block to land below the `*****` row and covers the gaps while minimizing additional height.\n\n**Answer: 6 0**","\nTo optimize placement, we need to ensure the block integrates into the board without exceeding the boundaries, minimizes gaps, and ideally clears rows. Looking at the board and current block, we analyze all possible placements and rotations.\n\nObservations:\n1. The block is shaped such that in its 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270° configurations, it occupies 3 squares.\n2. Considering the state of the board, placing blocks to fill the gaps or create opportunity to clear rows optimally is crucial.\n\n### Optimal Placement Analysis:\n- The block rotated to `90°` aligns well when dropped at `column 6`. This helps in filling an adjacent gap on row 6 and integrating smoothly with the existing blocks. It doesn't exceed the board's top boundary.\n\n### Resulting Board after Placement (`Column 6`, `Rotation 90°`):\n```\n..........\n..........\n.....**...\n.....***..\n.....**...\n......*...\n..*****...\n..*****...\n...***.*..\n....****..\n```\n\nThis placement avoids unnecessary gaps and creates possibilities for clearing subsequent rows.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 6 90"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Rotating the block to **90°** or **270°** will occupy a vertical arrangement across three rows.\n   - Based on the current board state, a valid placement allows the block to land without exceeding the top boundary and should clear or avoid blocking rows.\n\n4. **Optimal Action for Block Placement:**\n   - Rotating the block **0° (default orientation)** would allow it to land with its horizontal form. \n   - Dropping at **column 4** (using coordinates starting from 1 for the leftmost position) places the block optimally on the board without collisions and keeps the board stable.\n\n### Final Board After Placement:\nIf the block rotated at **0°** drops in column 4, the updated board will look like this:\n```\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..**......\n..****....\n....**....\n...**.....\n....*.....\n...***....\n```\n\n### Final Answer:  \nAnswer: 4 0","To solve this problem, I must determine the best placement for the currently falling block. I’ll first analyze the board and determine where to drop the 2x2 block in its best rotation.

The block will fit cleanly, minimize gaps, and provide balance for further stacking.\n\n### Step 4: Rotation Selection\nSince all rotations are identical, we can use the default **0°** rotation.\n\n### Final Decision:\nDrop the block at column **5** with rotation **0°**.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 5 0","To solve this, I need to analyze the given block and determine the best placement and rotation on the board that avoids blocking subsequent moves and maximizes the score potential.

The current block has four rotations available:  \n   - 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°.  \n2. The board is quite dense at the bottom, with fewer opportunities to clear rows.  \n3. The block consists of 4 occupied positions and appears compact, making it flexible to fit into several configurations.\n\n### Solution Steps:\n1. Evaluate all possible drop coordinates and rotation angles to find the optimal placement.\n2. Simulate how the board will look after placement, prioritizing row clears and minimal obstruction for future blocks.\n\n#### Optimal Placement:\nAfter evaluating, placing the block rotated at `90°` at drop coordinate `6` provides a good match on the right side, preventing gaps and contributing to eventual row clears.

This will position the block such that it rests directly above row 5, filling empty spaces and setting up potential row clearing in subsequent turns.\n\nPlacing the block in column 4 (with its left edge aligned to column 4) at rotation angle 0° will result in the following board:\n\n```\n..........\n..........\n..........\n...**.....\n.****.....\n....**....\n...***....\n...**.....\n.**.*.****\n**.****...\n```\n\nThe score does not increase in this placement, but it strategically sets up the board for future opportunities.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 4 0","To play this Tetris game, I will analyze the board and the falling block to determine the optimal placement in terms of minimizing gaps and clearing lines wherever possible. \n\n### Step-by-step process:\n1. **Analyze the board:** Check the configuration of the current board and identify possible spaces where the block can be placed with minimal obstruction.\n2. **Analyze the block:** The block can be rotated in 4 different orientations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°).

The goal is to avoid the block exceeding the top boundary and, ideally, create or contribute to the formation of complete rows.\n\n### Board analysis:\n\nThe board has columns numbered from 1 to 10 (from left to right).  \nThe falling block has several rotation options (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°). We need to calculate:\n1. The best rotation state.\n2. The optimal column for the leftmost square of the block.\n\nThe current block in all rotations is a 2x2 block, which makes it straightforward to consider for placement.\n\n### Evaluation of placements:\n\nThe block should ideally:\n- Land where it contributes to row clearing.\n- Avoid floating excessively above the current blocks.\n- Prevent future problematic gaps.\n\n### Analysis of rotations:\n\nLooking at each rotation, we observe that all states are effectively the same for this particular shape, as the block occupies a 2x2 area regardless of how it rotates.\n\n### Calculation of the drop position:\n\nAfter inspecting every column position, the best spot to drop the block is **column 8**, and the rotation can remain **0°**. Dropping it in column 8 at 0° will touch the highest surface while filling a gap and contributing useful structure to the board.\n\n### Updated board after the move:\n\nIf dropped at column 8 with 0° rotation, the block will land at:\n```\n..........\n..*.......\n..*.......\n..***.....\n*..**.....\n*..*...**.\n*.**...**.\n*..**..*..\n**.******.\n****..****.  <-- One row becomes fully occupied due to this move.\n```\nThe row clears, and the score increases by 1.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 8 0","To solve this Tetris puzzle, I will analyze the board and determine the best placement of the current block. My objective is to strategically position the block to avoid exceeding the top boundary and potentially clear any rows, increasing the score.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Current Block\nThe Current Block can be represented in 4 rotation states:\n- 0°:\n  ```\n  0*0\n  ***\n  ```\n- 90°:\n  ```\n  *0\n  **\n  *0\n  ```\n- 180°:\n  ```\n  ***\n  0*0\n  ```\n- 270°:\n  ```\n  0*\n  **\n  0*\n  ```\n\n### Step 2: Examine the Board\nThe current board:\n```\n..........\n..*.......\n..*.......\n..***..**.\n*..**...**\n*..*...**.\n*.**...**.\n*..**..*..\n**.******.\n****..***.\n```\n\nKey observations:\n1. The first row from the top has no blocks, which is good.\n2. The lowest row (last row) has some spaces filled, but no full rows to clear at the moment.\n3. There is an empty region in columns 6–10 (towards the far right), which seems ideal for fitting the block.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Possible Block Placements\n1. **0° placement:** The block takes 3 columns in width due to the horizontal row of `***`. This block can drop into spaces to align horizontally. If placed in column 7, it fits perfectly and avoids overlap, leaving space for the next blocks:\n   ```\n   ..........\n   ..*.......\n   ..*.......\n   ..***..**.\n   *..**...**\n   *..*...**.\n   *.**...**.\n   *..**.***.\n   **.******.\n   ****..***.\n   ```\n\n2. **90° placement:** The vertical orientation (1 column wide) is unsuitable considering the sparse distribution of empty columns. The block would not fill any significant gaps or stack cleanly.\n\n3. **180° placement:** The block at 180° is identical to 0°, and any placement for 0° also applies to 180°.\n\n4. **270° placement:** This orientation is also vertical, similar to 90°, and does not fit well into empty spaces on the current board.\n\n### Step 4: Choose the Optimal Move\nI will place the block at **column 7** with a **rotation of 0°**, because it fits cleanly into the available space without causing overlap or top-boundary issues.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 7 0","To solve this problem, we must determine the best placement for the current block on the board.

This placement reduces gaps and avoids creating new holes.\n\n### Chosen Placement:\n- **Drop Coordinate**: 4 (The horizontal position where the leftmost part of the block is placed, counted from 1 at the far-left column).\n- **Rotation Angle**: 0 (The block is placed in its default orientation).\n\n### Final Placement:\n- The block lands in column 4.

Here's the analysis:\n\n### Current Board:\n```\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..*.......\n****......\n*.**......\n****......\n***.*.....\n***.**....\n**...*....\n```\n\n### Current Block and Rotations:\n```\n0°:\n**0\n0**\n\n90°:\n0*\n**\n*0\n\n180°:\n**0\n0**\n\n270°:\n0*\n**\n*0\n```\n\n### Observations:\n1. The block is a Z-shape.\n2. The goal is to drop the block to create filled rows or minimize gaps by fitting into spaces efficiently.\n3. The leftmost column a block can occupy is 1, and the rightmost column is 10.\n\n### Suitable Placement:\n- **Analyzing Rotations**:\n  - **Rotation 0°**:\n    - The first row has two horizontal `*`.\n    - Fits well starting in **column 8** on **row 7**, aligning with gaps below.\n  - **Rotation 90° and 270°**:\n    - These rotations result in a vertical arrangement.\n    - Doesn't fit as neatly into available spaces.\n  - **Rotation 180°**:\n    - Same as Rotation 0° after flipping, fits best in **column 8**.\n\n- **Final Decision**:\n  Rotation **0°** offers the best placement, aligning well with gaps in the board in column **8**.\n\n### Final Move:\nI will drop the block starting at column 8, using rotation angle 0°.\n\n```\nAnswer: 8 0\n```","To solve this problem, I'll attempt to strategically place the current block to maximize the available space, avoid leaving gaps, and potentially clear rows. The chosen position and rotation will depend on how well the block fits on the board.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the board and the block\nThe current block can rotate to fit different configurations:\n- 0°:  \n  ```\n  *00\n  ***\n  ```\n- 90°:  \n  ```\n  **\n  *0\n  *0\n  ```\n- 180°:  \n  ```\n  ***\n  00*\n  ```\n- 270°:  \n  ```\n  0*\n  0*\n  **\n  ```\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate placement options\nI'll evaluate the board and decide the best position\/rotation pair for the current block. Important considerations:\n1. Minimize gaps below the placed block.\n2. Avoid causing obstruction for future placements.\n3. Aim to complete a row if possible.\n\n### Step 3: Placement\nLooking at the board:\n```\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..*.......\n****......\n*.**......\n****......\n***.*.....\n***.**.**.\n**...*..**\n```\n- A good placement for the block in the 90° rotation is in **column 6**. The left column of the block will align to column 6, leaving minimal gaps and fitting well without obstructing other portions of the board. The block will look like this after landing:\n  ```\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..*.......\n****......\n*.**......\n****......\n***.*.....\n***.**.***\n**.*.*..**\n  ```\n\n### Step 4: Solution\nThe action is to **drop the block starting at column 6** (leftmost position of the block) with a **rotation angle of 90°**.\n\nAnswer: 6 90","To solve this Tetris puzzle, let's analyze the board and determine where the current block—given its rotations—can best fit. We'll aim to prevent the stack of blocks from exceeding the top boundary while also clearing rows whenever possible.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n1. **Understand the Block's Shapes:**\n   - The current block can take one of four rotation states:\n     - **0°**: `0**`, `**0`\n     - **90°**: `*0`, `**`, `0*`\n     - **180°**: `0**`, `**0`\n     - **270°**: `*0`, `**`, `0*`\n\n2. **Assess the Current Board:**\n   - The board has various existing blocks. Dropping the current block needs careful consideration to ensure it fits and avoids obstruction while maintaining safe placement for future blocks.\n   - Dropping along the edges or entirely open columns (like column 1 or column 10) is an option, but optimizing placement could help clear rows or prevent unnecessary height.\n\n3. **Testing Block Placement:**\n   - The goal is to drop the block in a position where it fits snugly and has the potential to create a full row.\n   - Based on the analysis, consider all rotational states and determine the best column.\n\n4. **Best Drop Location:**\n   - By rotating the block to **0°**, the shape fits when dropped starting at **column 4**. This is the optimal location to avoid obstructing other areas, maximize future moves, and prevent excessive stacking.\n\n---\n\n### Solution\nThe block should be rotated to **0°** and dropped at **column 4**.\n\n**Answer: 4 0**","To solve this problem, we need to place the current block on the game board in such a way that we optimize for clearing rows or minimizing obstruction. Let's analyze the current situation:\n\n### Game Board:\n```\n..........\n..........\n....**....\n..***.....\n****......\n*.**.**...\n****.*....\n***.**....\n***.**.**.\n**...*..**\n```\n\n### Current Block:\n0°:\n```\n0**\n**0\n```\n\n90°:\n```\n*0\n**\n0*\n```\n\n180°:\n```\n0**\n**0\n```\n\n270°:\n```\n*0\n**\n0*\n```\n\n### Analysis:\nUsing the board and block information, we analyze where and at which rotation the block can be dropped:\n\n#### Strategy:\n1. **Clearing rows**: Check for placements that help clear rows.\n2. **Minimizing empty spaces**: Fit the block into gaps or areas with minimal empty spaces.\n3. **Avoid obstruction**: Ensure the top of the board is not obstructed to prevent the game from ending prematurely.\n\n#### Testing Rotations and Positions:\n\nLet’s test all four rotations and their respective positions from left (column 1) to right (column 10):\n\n---\n\n#### Placement Testing:\n\n- **Placement in column 3, 90° rotation**:\n  - The block lands favorably, plugging gaps and reducing obstruction.\n  - Resulting board:\n    ```\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ....**....\n    ..***.....\n    ****......\n    **.*.**...\n    ****.*....\n    ***.**....\n    ***.**.**.\n    **...*..**\n    ```\n\nThis is the most immediate optimal placement.\n\n### Solution:\nDrop the block at **column 3**, with a **90° rotation**.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 3 90","To determine the optimal placement for the current block, we must consider how to maximize row clearing and minimize stacking height, ensuring the block does not exceed the board boundary. Given the board and current block information:\n\n### Analysis:\nThe current block is a straight, 4-block shape. It can fit into vertical gaps with its 90° or 270° rotation, or it can be laid horizontally with its 0° or 180° rotations.\n\n#### Observations:\n1. The horizontal 0° placement has the potential to help clear rows if placed strategically, such as filling partially occupied rows.\n2. Vertical placements (90° or 270° rotations) can drop into gaps and exploit column openings.\n3. We aim to drop the block into a position that contributes to a possible row clearance while avoiding height overflow.\n\n### Evaluation:\nThe board currently has an open space in column 9 to accommodate the block vertically. Therefore, a rotation of 90° or 270° dropping into column 9 or 10 prevents height overflow and aligns the block with available gaps effectively.\n\n### Action:\nDrop the block in column 9, using the 90° rotation.\n\n### Resulting Board:  \n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n....*.**..\n***.****\n***.***.**\n**...*..**\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 9 90","To determine the correct action, we need to identify the optimal drop coordinate and rotation of the current block to avoid obstructing the game's progress and clear rows wherever possible.\n\n### Analyzing Current Block and Board:\nThe current block can be rotated into four configurations: 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°. Based on the board state and these rotations, the goal is to drop the block such that it fits without exceeding the boundaries or obstructing other blocks unnecessarily. We will consider each rotation and position option, aiming to maximize row-clearing possibilities and maintain safety at higher rows.\n\n### Strategy:\n- **Rotation Analysis**:\n  We note that the 0° and 180° rotations form a horizontal `z`-shape, while 90° and 270° resemble `v` or staircase-like vertical shapes. We will examine how each fits into the current board.\n\n- **Optimal Placement**:\n  Given the leftmost column (1) and rightmost column (10) constraints, we will drop the block such that it lands cleanly without exceeding the top boundary.\n\n### Testing Drop:\nAfter testing options for clarity and no obstruction, the **best option** is to rotate the block to 90° and drop it in column 8. This will maintain board stability and potentially set up future row-clearing opportunities.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 8 90","To solve this game, I must figure out the best position of the current block such that the board remains playable. The main goal is to minimize potential issues (like block overflow) while maximizing cleared rows.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Current Block and Rotations\nThe current block and its rotation states are:\n- **0°**  \n  ```\n  0*0\n  ***\n  ```\n- **90°**  \n  ```\n  *0\n  **\n  *0\n  ```\n- **180°**  \n  ```\n  ***\n  0*0\n  ```\n- **270°**  \n  ```\n  0*\n  **\n  0*\n  ```\n\nThis is a vertically symmetric \"T-shaped\" block, and its placement will depend on how it fits with existing gaps in the board.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Optimal Placement\nThe board presents significant block clutter, with gaps threatening future placements. Reviewing the board:\n1. There are gaps near the midsection (columns 4–6) that can host the block neatly.\n2. Several columns are taller relative to others; prioritize placing the block in a lower column to reduce stacking too high.\n\nThe **0° rotation** appears the most solid since its horizontal span fills gaps in a single row effectively. I will use this configuration to try clearing rows and improve the setup.\n\n### Step 3: Simulation of Drop\nLet’s drop the block rotated by **0°** in **column 3** (the leftmost square starts at column 3). The board after this placement will look like:\n```\n..*.......\n..**......\n.***...*.  <- Row cleared! Score +1\n..***..**.\n****...**.\n*.**.**.*.\n****.*..*.\n***.**..*.\n***.**.**.\n**...*..**\n```\n\n### Final Answer\nDrop the block at **coordinate 3**, with a rotation of **0°**.\n\nAnswer: 3 0"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
