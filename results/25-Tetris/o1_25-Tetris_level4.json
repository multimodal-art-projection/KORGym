This will cause the block to descend until its bottom row rests on Row 5, occupying columns 1–3 in Row 4 and columns 2–3 in Row 5 without clearing any lines or causing a top-boundary overflow.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","A reasonable placement is to drop the S-shaped block in its 0° orientation at the far-left side. In that orientation (0°), the block occupies three columns but will collide with existing blocks if moved lower than rows 2 and 3. Placing its leftmost column at column 1 allows the bottom half of the block to rest on row 3 and the top half on row 2, avoiding any overlap with existing blocks and staying within the board’s boundaries.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","Placing the I-piece vertically in column 8 allows it to drop down to row 6 without exceeding the top boundary or colliding prematurely.\n\nAnswer: 8 90","","A valid placement for the current block is to drop it with no rotation (0°) so that its leftmost column is at 4. This allows the piece to descend and come to rest without overlapping existing blocks or going out of bounds.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","A suitable move is to drop the Z-shaped block in its 90° orientation starting at column 4. This placement allows the block to fit without collisions and settle just above row 4.\n\nAnswer: 4 90","Placing the block in its 0° orientation with its left edge at column 8 allows it to sit immediately on rows 1 and 2 without exceeding the top boundary or colliding with existing blocks. It cannot descend further because the square at (row 3, column 8) is occupied.\n\nAnswer: 8 0","Answer: 5 0","It is not possible to place the 2×2 block on the provided board without overlapping existing tiles or exceeding the top boundary. Any placement will result in a top-out condition, ending the game immediately.\n\nAnswer: 1 0"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
