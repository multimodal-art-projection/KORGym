The board has some existing blocks, and we want to find the best placement for the current block to maximize the score or set up for future placements. Let's analyze the possible placements and rotations.\n\nIf we rotate the block by 90 or 270 degrees, the block is 3 units tall and 2 wide. If we rotate the block by 0 or 180 degrees, the block is 2 units tall and 3 units wide.\n\nLet's consider a drop coordinate of 3 and a rotation of 90 degrees.\n..........\n**........\n.**.......\n.*........\n.**.......\n..*.......\n****....*.\n..**...**.\n****...***\n******.**.\nBecomes:\n..........\n**........\n.**.......\n.*........\n.**.......\n..*.......\n****....*.\n.***..**.\n****...***\n******.**.\n..*.......\n\nLet's consider a drop coordinate of 1 and a rotation of 0 degrees.\n..........\n**........\n.**.......\n.*........\n.**.......\n..*.......\n****....*.\n..**...**.\n****...***\n******.**.\nBecomes:\n**0.......\n0**.......\n**........\n.**.......\n.*........\n..*.......\n****....*.\n..**...**.\n****...***\n******.**.\n..*.......\n\nLet's try placing the block with rotation 0 at position 2.\n\nAnswer: 2 0","The optimal move appears to be placing the block at coordinate 7 with a rotation of 90 degrees. This will complete a row, resulting in a score increase.\n\nAnswer: 7 90\n","The goal is to find a valid drop coordinate and rotation angle for the current block that maximizes space utilization and minimizes the creation of future gaps.\n\nLooking at the board, the 0-degree rotation of the block (a straight line) seems like the best fit. Placing it horizontally in the first row would clear the first row completely and score a point.\n\nAnswer: 1 0\n"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
