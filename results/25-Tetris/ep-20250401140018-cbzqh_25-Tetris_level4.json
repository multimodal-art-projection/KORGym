The existing blocks are in columns 5 and 6, so placing the block such that the bottom row covers columns 4-6 or 5-7 would fit well.\n   - Example: Drop at 4 (so the bottom row covers columns 4-6):\n     - The block would land just above the existing blocks, filling columns 4-6 in row 8 and column 5 in row 7.\n\n2. **Rotation 90°**:\n   - The block is 2 units wide and 3 units tall.\n   - The leftmost square is the top-left '*' of the block.\n   - Possible drop coordinates: 1 to 9.\n   - Best placement: Drop at 5 so the block fits between the existing blocks (columns 5 and 6). However, this would leave a gap in column 4 or 7, which is not ideal.\n\n3. **Rotation 180°**:\n   - Similar to 0°, but the block is upside down.\n   - The bottom row is \"***\", so placing it above the existing blocks would cover columns 5-7 in row 8 and column 6 in row 7.\n   - Example: Drop at 5.\n\n4. **Rotation 270°**:\n   - Similar to 90°, but mirrored.\n   - The leftmost square is the bottom-left '*' of the block.\n   - Possible drop coordinates: 1 to 9.\n   - Best placement: Drop at 5, but this would leave gaps.\n\n### Best Action:\nThe best action is to use the 0° rotation and drop the block at column 4. This will:\n- Place the bottom row of the block (***) in columns 4-6 of row 8, just above the existing blocks in rows 9 and 10.\n- The top row of the block (0*0) will place a single '*' in column 5 of row 7.\n- This creates a solid stack without gaps and leaves room for future blocks.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 4 0","To determine the best action for the current Tetris game board and block, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n### Current Board State:\n```\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n....*.....\n...***....\n....**....\n....**....\n```\n- The board has some blocks near the bottom, with a few gaps.\n- The highest obstruction is in column 5 (0-indexed, counting from the left as column 0).\n\n### Current Block:\nThe block is a \"T\" shape with the following rotations:\n- 0°:\n  ```\n  0*0\n  ***\n  ```\n- 90°:\n  ```\n  *0\n  **\n  *0\n  ```\n- 180°:\n  ```\n  ***\n  0*0\n  ```\n- 270°:\n  ```\n  0*\n  **\n  0*\n  ```\n\n### Goal:\nPlace the block such that:\n1. It doesn't exceed the top boundary.\n2. It fills gaps or creates complete rows if possible.\n3. It doesn't leave unnecessary gaps.\n\n### Possible Actions:\n1. **Rotation 0° (original orientation)**:\n   - The block is 3 squares wide. It can be dropped in columns 1 to 8 (since the board is 10 columns wide).\n   - The best fit is to place it in column 3 (0-indexed) or 4 (1-indexed), where it can fill the gap in column 4 and rest on the existing blocks.\n\n2. **Rotation 90°**:\n   - The block is 2 squares wide and 3 tall. It can be dropped in columns 1 to 9.\n   - Placing it in column 4 (1-indexed) would fit well, but it might not fill gaps as effectively as the 0° rotation.\n\n3. **Rotation 180°**:\n   - Similar to 0°, but upside down. Placing it in column 4 (1-indexed) would cover the gap in column 5.\n\n4. **Rotation 270°**:\n   - Similar to 90°, but mirrored. Not as useful here.\n\n### Best Action:\n- **Rotation 0°** placed in column 4 (1-indexed) is the most efficient:\n  - It will fill the gap in column 5 (0-indexed) and rest on the existing blocks in rows 7 and 8.\n  - The block will land neatly without creating new gaps.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 4 0","To determine the best action for the current Tetris block, let's analyze the game board and the possible rotations and placements of the current block.\n\n### Current Block:\nThe current block is a straight line (I-shaped) with the following rotations:\n- 0° and 180°: Horizontal line (****)\n- 90° and 270°: Vertical line (single column of 4 '*'s)\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has some blocks already placed near the bottom. The highest obstruction is at row 6 (0-indexed, counting from the top). The current block is 4 units long, so we need to place it where it won't overlap with existing blocks and can land securely.\n\n### Possible Actions:\n1. **Horizontal Placement (0° or 180° rotation):**\n   - The block is 4 units wide. The board is 10 columns wide (0-9).\n   - Possible drop coordinates: 1 through 7 (since 7 + 4 - 1 = 10, the rightmost column).\n   - The best horizontal placement would be where the block can land without gaps. Looking at the board, the lowest row where the block can fit horizontally is row 6 (counting from the top, 0-indexed). The block would land on row 7 (just above the existing blocks).\n   - Example: Dropping at column 1 (leftmost) with 0° rotation would place the block from columns 1-4 in row 7.\n\n2. **Vertical Placement (90° or 270° rotation):**\n   - The block is 1 unit wide and 4 units tall. It can be dropped in any column where the bottom of the block can land on existing blocks or the bottom of the board.\n   - The best vertical placement would be where the block can fill a gap or reach the bottom. However, the current board doesn't have any gaps that a vertical line would fit into cleanly. The block would likely land on top of existing blocks, potentially creating a new height.\n\n### Optimal Action:\nThe horizontal placement is better here because:\n- It can cover a wide area and potentially clear a row if placed correctly.\n- The board has some rows with gaps that a horizontal line could fill (e.g., row 6 has \"....*.....\" which could be filled by a horizontal line starting at column 2 or 3).\n\nThe best placement is to drop the block horizontally (0° rotation) at column 3. This will place the block from columns 3-6 in row 7, filling the gaps in row 6 and potentially setting up for a row clear in the future.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 3 0","To determine the best action for the current Tetris block, let's analyze the board and the block's possible rotations and placements.\n\n### Current Board Analysis:\nThe board has several existing blocks, with the highest stack reaching up to the 6th row from the bottom.

It can be placed in columns 1 through 8 (since the board is 10 columns wide and the block is 3 units wide).\n   - The best placement is likely where the block can fit snugly against existing blocks or the bottom. For example, placing it in column 4 would fill the gap in the 4th column of the 5th row from the bottom.\n\n2. **90° Rotation**:\n   - The block is 2 units wide and 3 units tall. It can be placed in columns 1 through 9.\n   - Placing it in column 3 or 4 might help fill gaps, but it could also stack too high.\n\n3. **180° Rotation**:\n   - Similar to 0°, but the \"tail\" is on the right. Placing it in column 4 could fill the gap in the 4th column of the 5th row.\n\n4. **270° Rotation**:\n   - Similar to 90°, but the \"tail\" is on the bottom. Placing it in column 3 or 4 might work.\n\n### Best Action:\nThe most efficient placement is to use the **0° rotation** and drop the block in **column 4**.

The block would land neatly without gaps.\n\n#### Verifying:\n- At column 3, 90° rotation:\n  - The block would occupy:\n    - Row 5: Column 4\n    - Row 6: Columns 3 and 4\n    - Row 7: Column 3\n  - This doesn't overlap with existing '*' (existing '*' in column 4 is at row 7, and column 3 is at row 7).\n  - The block would stop at row 5 (column 4), row 6 (columns 3,4), row 7 (column 3).\n\nThis placement clears row 6 (since it would be fully occupied: columns 1-10 are not fully occupied, but this depends on the exact placement). However, in this case, it doesn't clear a row but fits well.\n\n### Alternative: 0° rotation:\n- Width: 3, Height: 2.\n- Leftmost '*' is at (0,0) and (1,1).\n- Possible columns: 1 to 8 (since width is 3).\n- Trying column 3:\n  - Occupies columns 3,4 (row 0) and 4,5 (row 1).\n  - Would fall until it hits existing blocks.\n  - Existing '*' in column 4 is at row 8, column 5 is at row 8.\n  - Would land at row 6 (columns 3,4) and row 7 (columns 4,5).\n  - Overlaps with existing '*' at row 7, column 4. Not valid.\n\nTrying column 6:\n- Occupies columns 6,7 (row 0) and 7,8 (row 1).\n- Would land at row 6 (columns 6,7) and row 7 (columns 7,8).\n- Existing '*' at column 7 is row 8, column 8 is row 8.\n- No overlap, valid placement.\n\nThis also works, but the 90° rotation at column 3 seems more optimal as it fills gaps better.\n\n### Final Decision:\nThe best placement is column 3 with 90° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 3 90","To determine the best action for the current Tetris block, let's analyze the board and the possible rotations and positions of the block.\n\n### Current Board Analysis:\nThe board has some blocks stacked near the bottom, with the highest obstruction at row 4 (counting from the top as row 0).

It doesn't exceed the top boundary (game over).\n2. It clears rows if possible (to increase the score).\n3. It minimizes gaps or uneven stacking for future blocks.\n\n### Possible Actions:\n1. **Rotation 0° (default)**:\n   - The block is 3 units wide. It can be dropped from columns 1 to 8 (since the board is 10 columns wide).\n   - The block will fall until it hits an obstruction or the bottom.\n   - Example: Dropping at column 4 (leftmost square at column 4):\n     - The block will land on row 6 (counting from the top as row 0), filling:\n       - Row 6: columns 4, 5, 6\n       - Row 7: columns 4, 5, 6\n     - This doesn't clear any rows.\n\n2. **Rotation 90°**:\n   - The block is 2 units wide and 3 units tall.\n   - Can be dropped from columns 1 to 9.\n   - Example: Dropping at column 3:\n     - The block will land on row 5, filling:\n       - Row 5: column 3\n       - Row 6: columns 3, 4\n       - Row 7: column 3\n     - This fits well and doesn't create gaps.\n\n3. **Rotation 180°**:\n   - Similar to 0°, but upside-down. Not useful here.\n\n4. **Rotation 270°**:\n   - Mirror of 90°. Similar utility.\n\n### Best Action:\nThe 90° rotation dropped at column 3 fits well and doesn't create gaps.

Similar fit as 0° but no better advantage.\n\n4. **Rotation 270°**:\n   - Same as 90° rotation but mirrored.

Currently, row 9 has a gap from columns 6 to 9 (except column 7). Placing the block horizontally here could help clear row 9 if it lands correctly.\n   - For example, placing it at column 6 (0° rotation) would cover columns 6-9 in row 9, but this would overlap with the block at column 7 in row 9. So this is invalid.\n   - Placing it at column 1 (0° rotation) would cover columns 1-4 in row 9, which is empty except for column 2. This would not clear any rows.\n   - Placing it at column 3 (0° rotation) would cover columns 3-6 in row 9, overlapping with column 3 and 5 in row 9. Invalid.\n   - Placing it at column 5 (0° rotation) would cover columns 5-8 in row 9, overlapping with column 5 and 7. Invalid.\n   - Placing it at column 7 (0° rotation) would cover columns 7-10 in row 9, overlapping with column 7. Invalid.\n   - Thus, the only valid horizontal placement is column 1, but this doesn't help much.\n\n2. **Place the block vertically (90° or 270° rotation):**\n   - The block is 1 unit wide and 4 units tall, so it can be placed in any column from 1 to 10.\n   - The best placement would be to fill the gap in column 6 (row 9 is empty in column 6).\n   - Placing it at column 6 (90° rotation) would fill rows 6-9 in column 6. This would not overlap with any existing blocks and would fill the gap in row 9.\n   - This is the most optimal move as it prepares for potential row clears in the future.\n\n### Final Decision:\n- Rotate the block to 90° (vertical) and drop it at column 6.

The goal is to place the current block without creating gaps and ideally to clear lines.\n\n### Current Block:\nThe block is a \"Z\" shape (or its mirror), and it can be rotated to 0°, 90°, 180°, or 270°. The block occupies 3 squares in all rotations.\n\n### Possible Placements:\n1. **0° or 180° rotation**: The block is horizontal and can fit in columns where there is space for 3 squares side by side.\n   - Example: Placing it at column 1 or 2 would fit, but it might not be optimal for clearing lines.\n   - Placing it at column 3 would overlap with existing blocks.\n   - Placing it at column 7 or 8 would fit, but it might leave gaps.\n\n2. **90° or 270° rotation**: The block is vertical and can fit in columns where there is space for 2 squares stacked vertically with an offset.\n   - Example: Placing it at column 1 would fit, but it might not be optimal.\n   - Placing it at column 2 would fit well, filling the gap in column 2 and potentially setting up for future line clears.\n\n### Optimal Placement:\nThe best placement seems to be rotating the block to 90° and dropping it at column 2. This will fill the gap in column 2 and align well with the existing blocks without creating new gaps.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 2 90","To determine the best action for the current Tetris game, let's analyze the board and the current block.\n\n### Current Board Analysis:\nThe board has several blocks already placed, with the highest stack reaching up to the 6th row from the bottom. The current block is a straight line (I-shaped block) that can be placed either horizontally (0° or 180°) or vertically (90° or 270°).\n\n### Block Placement Options:\n1. **Horizontal Placement (0° or 180°):**\n   - The block is 4 squares wide. The board width is 10, so the block can be placed from column 1 to 7 (since 1+4-1=4, ..., 7+4-1=10).\n   - The highest stack in the middle columns (around columns 4-6) is at row 6 (from the bottom), so placing the block horizontally here would not clear any rows and would stack higher.\n   - The best horizontal placement would be to fill gaps or avoid stacking too high. However, the current board doesn't have a clear gap for horizontal placement without stacking higher.\n\n2. **Vertical Placement (90° or 270°):**\n   - The block is 1 square wide and 4 squares tall. It can be placed in any column from 1 to 10.\n   - The best vertical placement would be to drop the block in a column where it can fill a gap or reach the bottom without stacking too high.\n   - Looking at the board, column 1 is empty up to the top, column 2 has blocks starting at row 6, column 3 has blocks starting at row 5, etc.\n   - The best option is to place the block vertically in column 1, where it will fill the empty space and not stack higher than existing blocks.\n\n### Decision:\n- **Rotation:** 90° (vertical orientation).\n- **Drop Coordinate:** 1 (leftmost column).\n\nThis placement will land the block vertically in column 1, filling the empty space and not causing any immediate stacking issues.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 1 90","To determine the best action for the current Tetris game, let's analyze the board and the possible placements of the current block.\n\n### Current Board Analysis:\nThe board has several rows partially filled, with the highest occupied row being the 8th row from the top (counting from the bottom as rows 1 to 10). The current block is a Z-shaped tetromino (or its mirror), and it can be placed in one of its four rotation states.\n\n### Block Rotations:\n- **0° rotation**:\n  ```\n  **0\n  0**\n  ```\n  This shape is 3 columns wide and 2 rows tall. The leftmost square is at the top-left corner.\n\n- **90° rotation**:\n  ```\n  0*\n  **\n  *0\n  ```\n  This shape is 2 columns wide and 3 rows tall.

It can be placed in columns 1 through 8 (since the board is 10 columns wide and the block is 3 columns).\n   - The block will fall until it hits an occupied square or the bottom of the board.\n   - The best placement would be where it fills gaps or completes rows. For example, placing it in column 3 or 4 might help fill gaps in the middle.\n\n2. **90° or 270° rotation**:\n   - The block is 2 columns wide and 3 rows tall. It can be placed in columns 1 through 9.\n   - This rotation might be useful for fitting into narrow gaps or stacking vertically.\n\n### Optimal Placement:\nLooking at the board, the middle (columns 4-6) is quite filled, so placing the block in the 0° or 180° rotation in column 3 or 7 might be best. Column 3 seems promising because it can fill the gap in the middle-left.\n\n### Action:\n- **Rotation**: 0° (no rotation needed, as it fits well in the current orientation).\n- **Drop Coordinate**: 3 (leftmost column of the block).\n\nThis will place the block in column 3, where it will fall and fit snugly into the existing blocks without causing any overflow.\n\nAnswer: 3 0","To determine the best action for the current Tetris game board and block, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n### Current Board Analysis:\nThe board has several occupied spaces, with the highest blocks reaching near the top.

The game will likely end here due to the block exceeding the top boundary when placed.\n\nHowever, since the game requires an action, the best possible (though invalid) placement is to drop the block in column 1 with 0° rotation, as it minimizes overlap (though it will still overlap).\n\nAnswer: 1 0"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Board\nThe current board has the following structure:\n```\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n...*......\n...***....\n```\n- The bottom rows have some blocks, with the lowest row being `...***....` (columns 4, 5, 6 occupied) and the row above it having a single block at column 4 (`...*......`).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Current Block\nThe current block has 4 rotation states:\n- **0°**:\n  ```\n  *00\n  ***\n  ```\n  - Width: 3, Height: 2\n- **90°**:\n  ```\n  **\n  *0\n  *0\n  ```\n  - Width: 2, Height: 3\n- **180°**:\n  ```\n  ***\n  00*\n  ```\n  - Width: 3, Height: 2\n- **270°**:\n  ```\n  0*\n  0*\n  **\n  ```\n  - Width: 2, Height: 3\n\n### Step 3: Determine Possible Placements\nWe need to find a rotation and drop coordinate where the block can fit without overlapping existing blocks or going out of bounds.\n\n#### Option 1: 0° Rotation\n- Shape:\n  ```\n  *00\n  ***\n  ```\n- The block is 3 units wide. It can be dropped from columns 1 to 8 (since the board is 10 columns wide and the block is 3 units wide).\n- The block will fall until it hits the bottom or another block.\n- The lowest empty row is row 8 (0-indexed, counting from the top). The block will land on row 8 if dropped in columns 4-6 (due to the existing blocks in rows 8 and 9).\n- For example, dropping at column 4:\n  - The block will land on row 8, overlapping with the existing block at column 4. This is invalid.\n- Dropping at column 1:\n  - The block will fall to row 9 (bottom row), fitting as:\n    ```\n    *00.......\n    ***.......\n    ```\n  - This is valid.\n\n#### Option 2: 90° Rotation\n- Shape:\n  ```\n  **\n  *0\n  *0\n  ```\n- The block is 2 units wide and 3 units tall. It can be dropped from columns 1 to 9.\n- The block will fall until it hits the bottom or another block.\n- Dropping at column 1:\n  - The block will fall to row 8 (since row 9 is occupied in columns 1 and 2 by `...***....`).\n  - The block will fit as:\n    ```\n    **........\n    *0........\n    *0........\n    ```\n  - This is valid.\n\n#### Option 3: 180° Rotation\n- Shape:\n  ```\n  ***\n  00*\n  ```\n- Similar to 0° rotation, but the empty space is on the right.\n- Dropping at column 1:\n  - The block will fall to row 9, fitting as:\n    ```\n    ***.......\n    00*.......\n    ```\n  - This is valid.\n\n#### Option 4: 270° Rotation\n- Shape:\n  ```\n  0*\n  0*\n  **\n  ```\n- Similar to 90° rotation, but the empty space is on the left.\n- Dropping at column 3:\n  - The block will fall to row 8, fitting as:\n    ```\n    ..0*......\n    ..0*......\n    ..**......\n    ```\n  - This is valid.\n\n### Step 4: Choose the Best Option\nWe want to maximize the chance of clearing rows (scoring) and avoid gaps. The best option is to use the 0° rotation and drop at column 1, as it will fill the bottom row completely when combined with existing blocks:\n- After dropping at column 1 with 0° rotation:\n  - The board will have:\n    ```\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    ..........\n    *00.......\n    *****.....\n    ```\n  - The bottom row (`*****....`) is not fully cleared, but this is the most stable placement.\n\nAlternatively, using the 180° rotation and dropping at column 7:\n- The block will fall to row 9, fitting as:\n  ```\n  .....***..\n  .....00*..\n  ```\n- This will create a new block at columns 7-9 in row 9, but it doesn't help in clearing rows.\n\nThe safest and most straightforward option is to use the 0° rotation and drop at column 1.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 1 0","To determine the best action for the current Tetris game, let's analyze the board and the possible placements of the current block.\n\n### Current Board:\nThe board is almost empty except for the bottom two rows:\n```\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n*..*......\n******....\n```\n- The 9th row has blocks at columns 1 and 4 (`*..*......`).\n- The 10th row is almost fully occupied (`******....`).\n\n### Current Block:\nThe block is a \"Z\" shape (or its mirror) with the following rotations:\n- 0°:\n  ```\n  0**\n  **0\n  ```\n- 90°:\n  ```\n  *0\n  **\n  0*\n  ```\n- 180°:\n  ```\n  0**\n  **0\n  ```\n- 270°:\n  ```\n  *0\n  **\n  0*\n  ```\n\n### Possible Actions:\nWe need to place the block such that it doesn't overlap with existing blocks and doesn't exceed the top boundary.

This would overlap. Invalid.\n   - Column 2:\n     - Columns 2-4: The 10th row is `******....`, so columns 2-4 are `***`. Overlap. Invalid.\n   - Column 3:\n     - Columns 3-5: The 10th row is `******....`, so columns 3-5 are `***`. Overlap. Invalid.\n   - Column 4:\n     - Columns 4-6: The 10th row is `******....`, so columns 4-6 are `***`. Overlap. Invalid.\n   - Column 5:\n     - Columns 5-7: The 10th row is `******....`, so columns 5-7 are `***`. Overlap. Invalid.\n   - Column 6:\n     - Columns 6-8: The 10th row is `******....`, so columns 6-8 are `...`. No overlap in the 10th row.\n     - The 9th row is `*..*......`, so columns 6-8 are `...`. No overlap.\n     - This is a valid placement. The block would land at row 9, columns 6-8.\n\n2. **90° rotation:**\n   - The block is 2 columns wide and 3 rows tall.\n   - The leftmost column can be placed from column 1 to column 9 (10 - 2 + 1 = 9).\n   - We need to check for overlaps in the bottom 3 rows.\n\n   - Column 1:\n     - The block would cover rows 8-10, columns 1-2.\n     - The 10th row, columns 1-2: `**`.

The leftmost column is 1, and the rightmost possible is 8 (since 1 + 3 - 1 = 10).\n- The best fit seems to be dropping it in column 1 or 2 to fill gaps on the left side.\n\n#### Trying 90° or 270° rotation (same shape):\n- The block is 2 units wide. The leftmost column is 1, and the rightmost possible is 9.\n- This could fit in column 1 or 2 to fill the left side gaps.\n\n### Best Action:\n- The left side (columns 1-2) has gaps that can be filled by the 90° or 270° rotation. The 90° rotation fits well in column 1, filling the space neatly without creating new gaps.\n\n### Final Decision:\n- **Rotation:** 90°\n- **Drop Coordinate:** 1 (leftmost column)\n\nThis will place the block in the leftmost column, filling the gap and potentially setting up for future line clears.\n\nAnswer: 1 90","To determine the best action for the current block, let's analyze the board and the possible rotations and positions of the block.\n\n### Current Board Analysis:\nThe board has some gaps and uneven terrain, especially around the middle and right side.

The block looks like this in all rotations:\n   ```\n   **\n   **\n   ```\n3. **Placement Options**: Since the block is 2 units wide, it can be placed in columns 1 through 9 (because placing it in column 10 would make it extend beyond the board's width). The rotation angle doesn't matter here because the block is rotationally symmetric.\n\n### Best Action:\n- Since the board is empty, the best strategy is to place the block in a column where it can land at the bottom of the board. Any column from 1 to 9 is valid, but for simplicity, we can choose the leftmost column (column 1).\n- The rotation angle can be any of the given options (0°, 90°, 180°, or 270°) since they are all equivalent for this block.

It can fit in columns where the bottom row and the row above it have space.\n     - For example, placing it in column 1 would cover columns 1-3.

The middle of the board (column 4) is a good starting point for balance.\n\n### Solution:\n- Drop coordinate: 4 (middle of the board)\n- Rotation angle: 0° (horizontal)\n\nAnswer: 4 0","To solve this, let's analyze the current game board and the falling block:\n\n1. **Current Board Analysis**:\n   - The board is almost empty except for a line of 4 blocks at the very bottom (row 10, columns 4-7).\n   - The falling block is a 2x2 square (O-block in Tetris terms), which looks the same in all rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°).\n\n2. **Possible Actions**:\n   - Since the block is a 2x2 square, rotation doesn't change its shape. Thus, the rotation angle doesn't matter here (we can choose any, e.g., 0°).\n   - We need to place the block such that it doesn't overlap with existing blocks and doesn't exceed the top boundary. The best placement is to stack it on top of the existing blocks to form a solid line and potentially clear a row.\n\n3. **Placement**:\n   - The existing blocks are in columns 4-7 of row 10. To stack the 2x2 block, we can place it starting at column 4 (aligned with the leftmost existing block) or column 5 (overlapping partially). \n   - Placing it at column 4 (leftmost square at column 4) will cover columns 4-5 of rows 9-10. This will not complete a row, but it's a safe placement.\n   - Placing it at column 5 will cover columns 5-6 of rows 9-10, which also doesn't complete a row.\n   - Placing it at column 3 will cover columns 3-4 of rows 9-10, which is also safe but leaves a gap at column 7.\n   - The optimal placement is column 4 to align with the existing blocks.\n\n4. **Rotation**:\n   - Since the block is a square, rotation doesn't matter. We'll use 0° for simplicity.\n\nThus, the best action is to drop the block at column 4 with 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","To determine the best action for the current Tetris game, let's analyze the board and the current block.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe current board has some blocks near the bottom:\n- Row 8: `...**.....`\n- Row 9: `...**.....`\n- Row 10: `...****...`\n\nThe highest occupied row is row 8, so there's plenty of space above to maneuver the block.\n\n### Current Block:\nThe current block is a \"T\" shape (also known as the T-tetromino).

The current block is a straight line (I-shaped tetromino) that can be placed either horizontally or vertically.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Block Rotations**:\n   - **0° (horizontal)**: The block is a horizontal line of 4 squares (`****`). It occupies 1 row and 4 columns.\n   - **90° (vertical)**: The block is a vertical line of 4 squares (each `*` in a separate row). It occupies 4 rows and 1 column.\n   - **180° (same as 0°)**: Identical to 0°.\n   - **270° (same as 90°)**: Identical to 90°.\n\n2. **Analyze the Board**:\n   - The board has some existing blocks (`*`) and empty spaces (`.`).

Understand the Current Block and Its Rotations:\nThe current block has 4 rotation states:\n- **0°**:\n  ```\n  0*0\n  ***\n  ```\n  This is a T-shaped block with the flat side down.\n- **90°**:\n  ```\n  *0\n  **\n  *0\n  ```\n  This is the T-block rotated 90° clockwise, with the flat side to the right.\n- **180°**:\n  ```\n  ***\n  0*0\n  ```\n  This is the T-block rotated 180°, with the flat side up.\n- **270°**:\n  ```\n  0*\n  **\n  0*\n  ```\n  This is the T-block rotated 270° clockwise, with the flat side to the left.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Current Board:\nThe current board has some occupied spaces (`*`) and some gaps. The goal is to place the block such that:\n- It doesn't overlap with existing blocks.\n- It fills gaps to potentially clear rows.\n- It doesn't exceed the top boundary (which would end the game).\n\n### 3. Possible Placements:\nWe will evaluate each rotation and find the best drop coordinate:\n\n#### Rotation 0°:\n- Shape:\n  ```\n  0*0\n  ***\n  ```\n- Width: 3 columns.\n- Possible drop coordinates: 1 to 8 (since the block is 3 wide, dropping at 9 or 10 would go out of bounds).\n- Check where the block can fit without overlapping existing `*`:\n  - Dropping at column 1: The block would land on top of existing blocks in rows 8-9.\n  - Dropping at column 2: Similar issue.\n  - Dropping at column 3: The block would fit nicely in the gap around row 6.\n  - Dropping at column 4: Would overlap with existing `*` in row 5.\n  - Dropping at column 5-8: Would overlap or not fit well.\n\nBest for 0°: Drop at column 3.\n\n#### Rotation 90°:\n- Shape:\n  ```\n  *0\n  **\n  *0\n  ```\n- Width: 2 columns.\n- Possible drop coordinates: 1 to 9.\n- Check placements:\n  - Dropping at column 4: Could fit in the gap around row 4.\n  - Other positions either overlap or don't fill gaps well.\n\nBest for 90°: Drop at column 4.\n\n#### Rotation 180°:\n- Shape:\n  ```\n  ***\n  0*0\n  ```\n- Width: 3 columns.\n- Possible drop coordinates: 1 to 8.\n- Check placements:\n  - Dropping at column 3: Could fit in the gap around row 3.\n  - Other positions overlap or don't fit well.\n\nBest for 180°: Drop at column 3.\n\n#### Rotation 270°:\n- Shape:\n  ```\n  0*\n  **\n  0*\n  ```\n- Width: 2 columns.\n- Possible drop coordinates: 1 to 9.\n- Check placements:\n  - Dropping at column 5: Could fit in the gap around row 5.\n  - Other positions overlap or don't fit well.\n\nBest for 270°: Drop at column 5.\n\n### 4. Choose the Best Option:\nWe want to maximize the chance of clearing rows.

No obvious good fit.\n\n### Best Action:\n- **Rotation: 0°** (no rotation).\n- **Drop coordinate: 4** (leftmost square of the block in column 4).\n  - This will place the \"T\" such that:\n    - The leftmost part fills the gap in column 3 (row 9).\n    - The middle part rests on the block in column 4 (row 9).\n    - The right part rests on the block in column 5 (row 9).\n\n### Resulting Board (Visualization):\nAfter dropping the block (0° rotation) in column 4:\n- The block will fall and settle in rows 8-9, filling the gap in column 3 (row 9) and creating a solid line in row 9.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 4 0","To determine the best action for the current Tetris block, let's analyze the board and the possible placements of the current block (a straight line piece, or \"I\" block).\n\n### Current Board Analysis:\nThe board has some blocks stacked near the bottom, with the highest obstruction at row 3 (counting from the top as row 1). The current block is a straight line (**** in 0° and 180° rotations, and a vertical line in 90° and 270° rotations).\n\n### Possible Actions:\n1. **0° or 180° rotation (horizontal line)**:\n   - The block is 4 units wide. It cannot be placed in columns 1-7 without overlapping existing blocks or going out of bounds. For example:\n     - Column 1: Overlaps with existing blocks in rows 9-10.\n     - Column 2: Overlaps with existing blocks in rows 9-10.\n     - Column 3: Overlaps with the block at row 3, column 3.\n     - Column 4: Overlaps with blocks in rows 4, 6, and 8.\n     - Column 5: Overlaps with blocks in rows 4, 6, and 7.\n     - Column 6: Overlaps with blocks in rows 4, 6, and 7.\n     - Column 7: Overlaps with the block at row 10, column 7.\n     - Column 8: No immediate obstructions, but the block would extend to column 11 (out of bounds).\n   - Thus, the horizontal rotation is not viable.\n\n2. **90° or 270° rotation (vertical line)**:\n   - The block is 1 unit wide and 4 units tall. We can place it in any column where the 4 rows below the drop point are clear.\n   - Possible columns:\n     - Column 1: Blocks at rows 9-10 obstruct.\n     - Column 2: Blocks at rows 9-10 obstruct.\n     - Column 3: Block at row 3 obstructs.\n     - Column 4: Blocks at rows 4, 6, and 8 obstruct.\n     - Column 5: Blocks at rows 5, 7 obstruct (but row 5 is clear except for column 5, which is empty in row 5).\n     - Column 6: Blocks at rows 6 and 7 obstruct.\n     - Column 7: Block at row 10 obstructs.\n     - Column 8: No obstructions (rows 8-11 are clear except for row 10, column 8 is empty).\n     - Column 9: No obstructions.\n     - Column 10: No obstructions.\n   - Best placement: Column 8, 9, or 10 to avoid creating gaps. Column 8 is optimal because it aligns with the right side of the existing stack.\n\n### Final Decision:\n- Rotate the block to 90° (vertical) and drop it in column 8. This will place the block vertically in column 8, filling rows 7-10 without causing any immediate obstructions or gaps.\n\nAnswer: 8 90","To determine the best action for the current block, let's analyze the board and the possible placements of the block in its different rotations.\n\n### Current Board Analysis:\nThe board has some occupied spaces ('*') and empty spaces ('.'). The goal is to place the current block such that it fits well without leaving gaps and potentially clears lines.\n\n### Current Block Rotations:\nThe block is a \"Z\" shape (or its mirror) with the following rotations:\n- 0°:\n  ```\n  0**\n  **0\n  ```\n- 90°:\n  ```\n  *0\n  **\n  0*\n  ```\n- 180°:\n  ```\n  0**\n  **0\n  ```\n- 270°:\n  ```\n  *0\n  **\n  0*\n  ```\n\n### Possible Placements:\n1. **0° Rotation (or 180° since they are identical):**\n   - The block is 3 columns wide and 2 rows tall.\n   - The leftmost column of the block is empty, so the block can be placed starting from column 1 to column 8 (since the board is 10 columns wide and the block is 3 columns wide).\n   - We need to find a column where the block can fit without overlapping existing '*'s and without leaving gaps underneath.\n\n2. **90° Rotation (or 270° since they are identical):**\n   - The block is 2 columns wide and 3 rows tall.\n   - The leftmost column of the block is occupied, so the block can be placed starting from column 1 to column 9.\n   - Similarly, we need to find a column where the block fits well.\n\n### Best Placement:\nLooking at the board, the best placement seems to be the 90° rotation dropped in column 4. Here's why:\n- The block in 90° rotation will fit snugly into the gap in the middle of the board (around column 4-5).\n- When placed in column 4, the block will fill the empty spaces and potentially clear lines when it lands.\n\n### Verification:\n- At column 4, the block in 90° rotation will occupy:\n  - Row 1: column 4 ('*'), column 5 (empty)\n  - Row 2: column 4 ('*'), column 5 ('*')\n  - Row 3: column 4 (empty), column 5 ('*')\n- The block will fall until it hits existing blocks or the bottom. Given the current board, it will likely land around row 7-8, filling gaps nicely.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 4 90","To determine the best action for the current block, let's analyze the game board and the block's possible placements.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe board has several columns with varying heights. Here's the height of each column (counting from the bottom, starting at 0):\n- Column 1: Height 1 (due to '*' at row 9)\n- Column 2: Height 2 (due to '*' at rows 8 and 9)\n- Column 3: Height 4 (due to '*' at rows 6, 7, 8, 9)\n- Column 4: Height 10 (due to '*' at rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, and '.' at row 4)\n- Column 5: Height 10 (due to '*' at rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, and '.' at row 4)\n- Column 6: Height 5 (due to '*' at rows 0, 3, 5, 7, 9)\n- Column 7: Height 2 (due to '*' at rows 6, 9)\n- Column 8: Height 3 (due to '*' at rows 5, 7, 9)\n- Column 9: Height 1 (due to '*' at row 9)\n- Column 10: Height 0 (empty)\n\n### Current Block:\nThe block is a 2x2 square (O-block in Tetris), which is rotationally symmetric. All rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) produce the same shape:\n**\n**\n\n### Possible Placements:\nThe block is 2 units wide, so it can be placed in columns 1 through 9 (column 10 would cause it to go out of bounds). We need to find a column where the block can fit without overlapping existing blocks or exceeding the top boundary.\n\nLet's check the heights of adjacent columns to see where the block can fit:\n- Columns 1-2: Heights 1 and 2. The block would stack on top of column 1 (height 1) and column 2 (height 2). The max height is 2, so the block would land at height 2 (rows 7 and 8).\n- Columns 2-3: Heights 2 and 4. The max height is 4, so the block would land at height 4 (rows 5 and 6).\n- Columns 3-4: Heights 4 and 10. The max height is 10, but column 4 is full (height 10), so the block cannot fit here.\n- Columns 4-5: Heights 10 and 10. Both columns are full, so the block cannot fit here.\n- Columns 5-6: Heights 10 and 5. Column 5 is full, so the block cannot fit here.\n- Columns 6-7: Heights 5 and 2. The max height is 5, so the block would land at height 5 (rows 4 and 5).\n- Columns 7-8: Heights 2 and 3. The max height is 3, so the block would land at height 3 (rows 6 and 7).\n- Columns 8-9: Heights 3 and 1. The max height is 3, so the block would land at height 3 (rows 6 and 7).\n- Columns 9-10: Heights 1 and 0. The max height is 1, so the block would land at height 1 (rows 8 and 9).\n\n### Best Placement:\nThe goal is to avoid creating gaps and to aim for a flat surface. The best options are:\n1. Columns 1-2: Lands at height 2 (rows 7 and 8). This fills rows 7 and 8 in columns 1 and 2, which are currently empty in those rows.\n2. Columns 6-7: Lands at height 5 (rows 4 and 5). This fills rows 4 and 5 in columns 6 and 7, which are currently empty in those rows.\n3. Columns 8-9: Lands at height 3 (rows 6 and 7). This fills rows 6 and 7 in columns 8 and 9, which are currently empty in those rows.\n\nThe most straightforward placement is columns 1-2, as it doesn't create new gaps and fits neatly.\n\n### Final Action:\n- Drop coordinate: 1 (leftmost column of the block)\n- Rotation angle: 0° (since all rotations are the same, this is arbitrary)\n\nAnswer: 1 0","To determine the best action for the current Tetris block, let's analyze the board and the block's possible rotations and positions.\n\n### Current Board Analysis:\nThe board has several uneven stacks, with the highest point in the leftmost columns (columns 1-2 are filled up to row 8). The right side (columns 5-10) has more space, especially around columns 6-8.\n\n### Block Rotations:\nThe current block is a \"T\" shape with the following rotations:\n- **0°**:  \n  `0*0`  \n  `***`  \n  This is a horizontal T with the center at the bottom.\n- **90°**:  \n  `*0`  \n  `**`  \n  `*0`  \n  This is a vertical T with the center on the right.\n- **180°**:  \n  `***`  \n  `0*0`  \n  This is an upside-down horizontal T with the center at the top.\n- **270°**:  \n  `0*`  \n  `**`  \n  `0*`  \n  This is a vertical T with the center on the left.\n\n### Possible Actions:\n1. **0° Rotation (Horizontal T)**:\n   - The block is 3 units wide. It can be dropped in columns 1-8 (since the board is 10 columns wide).\n   - The best fit would be to place it where it can fill gaps or create a flat surface. Columns 4-6 seem promising because:\n     - Column 4 has a height of 4 (rows 7-10).\n     - Column 5 has a height of 5 (rows 6-10).\n     - Column 6 has a height of 3 (rows 8-10).\n   - Dropping it at column 4 (0°) would cover columns 4-6, filling the gap in column 6.\n\n2. **90° Rotation (Vertical T)**:\n   - The block is 2 units wide and 3 units tall. It can be dropped in columns 1-9.\n   - The best fit would be to place it where the center (right side) can fill a gap. Column 6 is a good candidate because:\n     - Column 6 has a height of 3 (rows 8-10).\n     - Column 7 has a height of 4 (rows 7-10).\n   - Dropping it at column 6 (90°) would cover columns 6-7, with the center filling the gap in column 6.\n\n3. **180° Rotation (Upside-down Horizontal T)**:\n   - Similar to 0°, but the center is at the top. This is less useful for filling gaps in the current board.\n\n4. **270° Rotation (Vertical T with center on left)**:\n   - Similar to 90°, but the center is on the left. This could be used to fill gaps in columns 5-6.\n\n### Best Action:\nThe most promising action is to use the **90° rotation** and drop it at **column 6**. This will:\n- Fill the gap in column 6 (rows 8-10).\n- Align with the height of column 7 (rows 7-10).\n- Potentially clear a row if the block lands perfectly.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 6 90","To determine the best action for the current Tetris block, let's analyze the board and the possible rotations and positions of the block.\n\n### Current Board Analysis:\nThe board has several occupied positions, with the highest blocks reaching near the top.

It can be placed in columns 1 to 8 (since the board is 10 columns wide).\n   - The best fit would be to place it where it can fill gaps or complete rows. For example, placing it in column 4 would fill some gaps but may not clear a row.\n\n2. **90° Rotation**:\n   - The block is 2 units wide and 3 units tall. It can be placed in columns 1 to 9.\n   - Placing it in column 3 or 4 could help fill gaps near the left side.\n\n3. **180° Rotation**:\n   - Similar to 0°, but the empty space is on the right. Placing it in column 2 could fill gaps on the left.\n\n4. **270° Rotation**:\n   - Similar to 90°, but the empty space is on the left. Placing it in column 5 or 6 could fill gaps on the right.\n\n### Best Action:\nAfter evaluating, the best action is to rotate the block to 270° and drop it in column 5.

The current block is a 2x2 square (O-block in Tetris), which looks the same in all rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°).\n3. The block will fall straight down until it hits another block or the bottom of the board.\n\n### Current Block:\nThe block is a 2x2 square:\n```\n**\n**\n```\nThis block is rotationally symmetric, so rotating it doesn't change its shape.\n\n### Possible Placements:\nWe need to place the block such that:\n1. It doesn't exceed the left or right boundaries (columns 1-10 for the leftmost square).\n2. It lands without overlapping existing blocks.\n3. Ideally, it should fill gaps or create complete rows for scoring.\n\n### Board State:\nLooking at the bottom rows:\n- Row 8: `****..****` (columns 1-4 and 7-10 are filled)\n- Row 9: `.**..**..*` (columns 2-3, 6-7, and 10 are filled)\n- Row 10: `**..**...*` (columns 1-2, 5-6, and 10 are filled)\n\n### Best Placement:\nThe only open spaces where the 2x2 block can fit are:\n1. Columns 5-6 in rows 8-9: \n   - Row 8, columns 5-6: `..` (empty)\n   - Row 9, columns 5-6: `..` (empty)\n   - This is a valid spot.\n2.

The goal is to maximize the score by clearing rows while ensuring the block doesn't exceed the top boundary of the board.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Current Block**: The current block is a 2x2 square (O-block in Tetris terms), which looks the same in all rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°). This means rotation doesn't change its shape, so we only need to decide where to drop it.\n\n2. **Analyze the Board**: The board has some gaps and filled spaces. We need to find a place where the 2x2 block can fit without overlapping existing blocks and where it can potentially help clear rows.\n\n3. **Potential Drop Positions**:\n   - The block is 2 units wide, so it can be dropped in columns 1 through 9 (since column 10 would make it go out of bounds).\n   - We need to check where the block can land without overlapping existing blocks ('*') and where it can fit snugly.\n\n4. **Best Position**:\n   - Look for the lowest possible position where the block can fit. This is typically the best strategy to keep the stack low and create opportunities for clearing rows.\n   - The block can fit in column 1 (leftmost), but the left side of the board is already filled, so dropping it there would stack it on top of existing blocks without clearing any rows.\n   - The right side of the board has some gaps. Dropping the block in column 7 or 8 could help fill gaps and potentially clear rows.\n\n5. **Check for Row Clearing**:\n   - Dropping the block in column 7 would place it on top of existing blocks without clearing any rows.\n   - Dropping the block in column 8 would fill the gap in the 8th and 9th columns in the second row from the bottom (row 9), potentially clearing that row if it becomes fully occupied. However, row 9 currently has \"**.****...\", so adding two more '*' in columns 8 and 9 would make it \"**.******\", which is not fully occupied (still has '.' in column 10).\n   - Dropping the block in column 3 would place it in a position where it doesn't immediately help clear rows but keeps the stack lower.\n\n6. **Optimal Choice**:\n   - The best immediate action is to drop the block in column 3, as it fits well and doesn't unnecessarily heighten the stack. This is a safe move that keeps future options open.\n\n### Final Answer:\nSince the block is a 2x2 square and rotation doesn't change its shape, we can drop it in column 3 with any rotation (we'll use 0° for simplicity).\n\nAnswer: 3 0"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The best column for a vertical drop is column 4 or higher to avoid the existing blocks in columns 1-3.\n   - If we keep the block horizontal (0° or 180°), we can place it at the top of the board, but this would not contribute to clearing rows or building a solid stack.\n\n4. **Optimal Action**:\n   - Rotate the block to 90° (vertical) and drop it in column 4.

This means rotation doesn't change the block's shape, so we only need to decide where to drop it.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe board has some gaps and uneven terrain. The goal is to place the block in a position that:\n1. Doesn't create overhangs (which could lead to gaps).\n2. Potentially clears lines (though with a 2x2 block, this is unlikely unless it fills in a partial line).\n3. Doesn't block future placements.\n\n### Possible Placements:\nThe block is 2 units wide, so it can be dropped in columns 1 through 9 (since column 10 would make it go out of bounds).\n\nLooking at the board, the highest points in each column are:\n- Column 1: Row 10 (blocked)\n- Column 2: Row 9 (blocked)\n- Column 3: Row 9 (blocked)\n- Column 4: Row 10 (blocked)\n- Column 5: Row 4 (blocked)\n- Column 6: Row 4 (blocked)\n- Column 7: Row 3 (blocked)\n- Column 8: Row 3 (blocked)\n- Column 9: Row 10 (blocked)\n- Column 10: Row 10 (blocked)\n\nThe block can be placed in any column where the two squares below it are empty or at the bottom. The best placement is to fill gaps or create a flat surface for future blocks.\n\n### Best Placement:\nThe best spot seems to be column 7 or 8, where the block can fill in the gap in rows 1-2. However, since the block is 2x2, we need to ensure both squares below it are empty or at the bottom.\n\nLooking at column 7:\n- The block would occupy rows 1-2 in columns 7-8.\n- The squares below (rows 3+) are blocked in column 7 (row 3) and column 8 (row 3), so the block would land at row 3.\n\nLooking at column 6:\n- The block would occupy rows 1-2 in columns 6-7.\n- The square below in column 6 is row 4 (blocked), and column 7 is row 3 (blocked), so it would land at row 3.\n\nColumn 5:\n- The block would occupy rows 1-2 in columns 5-6.\n- The square below in column 5 is row 4 (blocked), and column 6 is row 4 (blocked), so it would land at row 3.\n\nColumn 4:\n- The block would occupy rows 1-2 in columns 4-5.\n- The square below in column 4 is row 10 (blocked), and column 5 is row 4 (blocked), so it would land at row 3.\n\nColumn 3:\n- The block would occupy rows 1-2 in columns 3-4.\n- The square below in column 3 is row 9 (blocked), and column 4 is row 10 (blocked), so it would land at row 3.\n\nColumn 2:\n- The block would occupy rows 1-2 in columns 2-3.\n- The square below in column 2 is row 9 (blocked), and column 3 is row 9 (blocked), so it would land at row 3.\n\nColumn 1:\n- The block would occupy rows 1-2 in columns 1-2.\n- The square below in column 1 is row 10 (blocked), and column 2 is row 9 (blocked), so it would land at row 3.\n\nColumn 8:\n- The block would occupy rows 1-2 in columns 8-9.\n- The square below in column 8 is row 3 (blocked), and column 9 is row 10 (blocked), so it would land at row 3.\n\nColumn 9:\n- The block would occupy rows 1-2 in columns 9-10.\n- The square below in column 9 is row 10 (blocked), and column 10 is row 10 (blocked), so it would land at row 3.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the block is 2x2 and rotation doesn't change its shape, the best action is to drop it in a column where it can land without creating overhangs. The most straightforward placement is column 7 with 0° rotation (though rotation doesn't matter here).\n\nAnswer: 7 0","To determine the best action for the current Tetris game, let's analyze the board and the current block.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Current Board State**:\n   - The board has several filled rows, with the highest obstructions around columns 6-7.\n   - There are gaps in columns 1-5 that can be utilized.\n\n2. **Current Block (S-shape)**:\n   - The block can be rotated into 4 states (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°).\n   - The block occupies 3 squares in all rotations.\n\n3. **Possible Actions**:\n   - **Rotation 0° (default)**: The block is horizontal and can fit into gaps in columns 1-5.\n   - **Rotation 90°**: The block is vertical and can fit into narrower gaps.\n   - **Rotation 180°**: Same as 0°.\n   - **Rotation 270°**: Same as 90°.\n\n4. **Optimal Placement**:\n   - The best spot is to place the block in column 1 or 2 to fill gaps and avoid stacking too high.\n   - Rotating the block to 90° or 270° allows it to fit vertically into column 1 or 2, filling the gaps effectively.\n\n### Solution:\n- **Rotation**: 90° (vertical orientation).\n- **Drop Coordinate**: 1 (leftmost column).\n\nThis will place the block in column 1, filling the gap and avoiding stacking too high.

If we place the block in column 2:\n   - Similar issue as column 1, stacking on existing blocks.\n3. Columns 3-9:\n   - These columns are mostly empty, so placing the block here will not stack on existing blocks and will land at the bottom (row 10).\n\n### Optimal Placement:\nTo avoid stacking and keep the board as flat as possible, the best choice is to place the block in the rightmost empty columns. Column 9 is the furthest right we can place the block (since it's 2 units wide, columns 9-10 are empty).\n\n### Rotation:\nSince the block is symmetric, rotation doesn't matter.

It cannot be placed in columns 9 or 10 because it would exceed the board.\n   - If placed in column 1 (0°):\n     - The block would land on top of the existing blocks in rows 2-3, but this would leave gaps and not clear lines.\n   - If placed in column 2 (0°):\n     - The block would fit snugly next to the existing blocks in row 2 (`.**.....**`), filling some gaps but not clearing lines.\n   - Other columns (3-8) would leave gaps or overlap.\n\n2. **90° or 270° rotation**:\n   - The block is 2 units wide and 3 units tall.\n   - The best placement is in column 1 (90° or 270°):\n     - The block would fill the gap in row 3 (`**......**`) and row 2 (`.**.....**`), potentially clearing rows if more blocks are added later.\n     - Specifically, placing it in column 1 (90° rotation) would fit like this:\n       - Row 3: `**` (existing) + `*0` (block) → `***0....**`\n       - Row 2: `.**` (existing) + `**` (block) → `****....**`\n       - Row 1: `*0` (block) would land on the empty row 1.\n\n### Best Action:\nThe most efficient placement is to rotate the block 90° and drop it in column 1.

The right side is mostly empty, except for some blocks near the bottom. The current block is a 2x2 square (which looks the same in all rotations), so rotation doesn't change its shape.\n\n### Possible Actions:\nSince the block is a 2x2 square, the only meaningful decision is where to drop it. The goal is to:\n1. Avoid stacking too high (to prevent game over).\n2. Try to clear rows if possible (though this is unlikely with a 2x2 block unless placed perfectly).\n3. Prefer placing the block where it can fill gaps or create a smoother surface for future blocks.\n\n### Best Placement:\n- The left side (columns 1-3) is already quite stacked, so placing the block there would risk stacking too high.\n- The middle (columns 4-7) is relatively empty, but placing the block here might not be optimal for future placements.\n- The right side (columns 8-10) has some blocks near the bottom, but there's space to place the block without stacking too high.\n\nThe best option is to place the block in column 8 (right side), where it will land on top of the existing blocks in rows 8 and 9, creating a smoother surface.\n\n### Rotation:\nSince the block is a square, rotation doesn't matter.

This would place the block in rows 5-8 of column 8, stopping at row 6 because row 7 is occupied.\n\n### Final Decision:\n- **Drop Coordinate**: 8 (leftmost column of the block).\n- **Rotation Angle**: 90° (vertical orientation).\n\nThis placement will not exceed the top boundary and is the only viable move given the current board state.\n\nAnswer: 8 90","To determine the best action for the current Tetris game, let's analyze the board and the current block.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Current Board State**:\n   - The board has several uneven stacks of blocks, with the highest stack reaching the top in some columns (e.g., column 2).\n   - There are gaps and uneven terrain, which we need to consider when placing the current block.\n\n2. **Current Block (rotations)**:\n   - The block is a \"T\" shape (tetromino) with the following rotations:\n     - 0°: \n       ```\n       00*\n       ***\n       ```\n     - 90°:\n       ```\n       *0\n       *0\n       **\n       ```\n     - 180°:\n       ```\n       ***\n       *00\n       ```\n     - 270°:\n       ```\n       **\n       0*\n       0*\n       ```\n\n3. **Objective**:\n   - Place the block such that it fills gaps, avoids creating overhangs, and ideally clears lines.\n   - Avoid stacking too high, as the game ends if a block exceeds the top boundary.\n\n### Possible Actions:\n- **Rotation 0° (00* \/ ***)**:\n  - The block is 2 rows tall and 3 columns wide. The leftmost '*' is in the 3rd column of the block.\n  - Possible drop coordinates: 1 to 8 (since the block is 3 columns wide, dropping at 8 would place the rightmost '*' at column 10).\n  - Best fit: Drop at column 4. This would fill the gap in columns 4-6 in the middle of the board.\n\n- **Rotation 90° (*0 \/ *0 \/ **)**:\n  - The block is 3 rows tall and 2 columns wide. The leftmost '*' is in the 1st column of the block.\n  - Possible drop coordinates: 1 to 9.\n  - Best fit: Drop at column 7. This would fill the gap near the right side.\n\n- **Rotation 180° (*** \/ *00)**:\n  - The block is 2 rows tall and 3 columns wide. The leftmost '*' is in the 1st column of the block.\n  - Possible drop coordinates: 1 to 8.\n  - Best fit: Drop at column 2. This would fill the gap near the left side.\n\n- **Rotation 270° (** \/ 0* \/ 0*)**:\n  - The block is 3 rows tall and 2 columns wide. The leftmost '*' is in the 1st column of the block.\n  - Possible drop coordinates: 1 to 9.\n  - Best fit: Drop at column 5. This would fill the gap in the middle.\n\n### Best Action:\nAfter evaluating all rotations, the best action is to use the **0° rotation** and drop the block at column **4**.

Keep the stack as flat as possible.\n\n### Best Placement:\n- **Rotation: 0° or 180°** (they are identical for this block):\n  - The block can fit nicely in columns 4-6, where the terrain is lower on the right.\n  - Dropping it at column 4 would align the block's left part with the existing stack and let the right part fill the lower area.\n\n- **Rotation: 90° or 270°**:\n  - These rotations are taller and might not fit as well given the current terrain, as they would leave gaps or stack unevenly.\n\n### Final Decision:\n- **Drop coordinate: 4** (leftmost column of the block).\n- **Rotation angle: 0°** (no rotation, as it fits best).\n\nThis placement will fill the space neatly without creating gaps or unevenness.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","To determine the best action for the current Tetris game, let's analyze the board and the current block (a straight line piece, which can be rotated into four positions: horizontal or vertical).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Current Board State**:\n   - The board has several gaps and uneven heights, with the highest stack on the left side (column 1 is filled up to row 7).\n   - The right side (columns 6-10) has more space, with the highest stack in column 6 (row 5).\n\n2. **Current Block (Straight Line)**:\n   - **0° (horizontal)**: `****` (4 blocks wide)\n   - **90° (vertical)**: `*` (1 block wide, 4 blocks tall)\n   - **180° (horizontal)**: `****` (same as 0°)\n   - **270° (vertical)**: `*` (same as 90°)\n\n3. **Possible Actions**:\n   - **Horizontal Placement (0° or 180°)**:\n     - The block is 4 wide, so it can be placed in columns 1-7 (since the board is 10 columns wide).\n     - The left side (columns 1-4) is too high to place the block horizontally without exceeding the top.\n     - The right side (columns 5-7) has space to place the block horizontally, but we need to check the landing row.\n   - **Vertical Placement (90° or 270°)**:\n     - The block is 1 wide and 4 tall, so it can be placed in any column where the top 4 rows are empty or can be cleared.\n     - The right side (columns 8-10) is mostly empty, making vertical placement viable.\n\n4. **Best Placement**:\n   - **Horizontal Placement**:\n     - If placed horizontally in column 5 (drop coordinate 5, rotation 0°), the block would land on row 4 (just above the existing stack in column 5).\n     - This would fill rows 4-5 in columns 5-8, but it doesn't clear any rows.\n   - **Vertical Placement**:\n     - If placed vertically in column 10 (drop coordinate 10, rotation 90°), the block would extend from row 1 to row 4 (since column 10 is empty).\n     - This is safe but doesn't help clear rows or reduce height.\n     - Alternatively, placing vertically in column 8 or 9 could help fill gaps, but column 8 has a stack up to row 6, so the block would land on row 7.\n   - **Optimal Action**:\n     - The best action is to place the block horizontally in column 5 (drop coordinate 5, rotation 0°). This fills the gap in column 5 and aligns with the existing stack, potentially setting up for future row clears.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 5 0","To determine the best action for the current Tetris block, let's analyze the board and the possible placements of the block.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Current Block Shape (0° rotation)**:\n   ```\n   0**\n   **0\n   ```\n   - This is a \"Z\" shape block. The leftmost square is the second '*' in the first row (since the first is '0').\n\n2. **Possible Rotations**:\n   - **0°**: The block is in its original orientation.\n   - **90°**: The block is rotated clockwise by 90 degrees.\n   - **180°**: The block is upside down.\n   - **270°**: The block is rotated counterclockwise by 90 degrees.\n\n3. **Board State**:\n   - The board has some filled rows, and the goal is to place the block to clear rows or set up for future clears.\n\n4. **Placement Options**:\n   - **0° Rotation**:\n     - The block is 2 units tall and 3 units wide. The leftmost square is the second '*' in the first row.\n     - Possible drop coordinates: 1 to 8 (since the block is 3 units wide, it can't go beyond column 8).\n     - Check where the block can fit without overlapping existing '*'s or going out of bounds.\n   - **90° Rotation**:\n     - The block is 3 units tall and 2 units wide.\n     - Possible drop coordinates: 1 to 9.\n   - **180° Rotation**:\n     - Same as 0° but upside down.\n   - **270° Rotation**:\n     - Same as 90° but mirrored.\n\n5. **Best Placement**:\n   - Looking at the board, the best move is to place the block in the **0° rotation** at column **4**. This will fill the gap in the 4th column and potentially set up for future row clears.\n   - Alternatively, the **90° rotation** could be placed at column **3** to fill a gap, but the 0° rotation at column 4 seems more optimal for the current board.\n\n### Final Decision:\n- **Rotation**: 0° (no rotation needed).\n- **Drop Coordinate**: 4 (leftmost square of the block is placed at column 4).\n\nAnswer: 4 0","To determine the best action for the current Tetris game, let's analyze the board and the current block (a straight line piece, which can be rotated to be horizontal or vertical).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Current Block Rotations**:\n   - **0° (horizontal)**: `****` (4 blocks in a row)\n   - **90° (vertical)**: Four blocks stacked vertically (one per row)\n   - **180°**: Same as 0° (horizontal)\n   - **270°**: Same as 90° (vertical)\n\n2. **Board Analysis**:\n   - The board has uneven terrain with some gaps and peaks.

It can be placed in columns 1 through 7 (since the board is 10 columns wide).\n     - The best placement would be to fill gaps or complete lines. For example:\n       - Placing it at column 4 (horizontal) would cover the existing `**` at row 2, but this doesn't clear a line.\n       - Placing it at column 1 (horizontal) would fill the left side but leave gaps.\n   - **Vertical (90° or 270°)**:\n     - The block is 1 unit wide and 4 units tall. It can be placed in any column (1 through 10).\n     - The best placement is to drop it into a column where it can fill a gap or reach the bottom without creating new gaps.\n     - Column 3 is a good candidate because:\n       - The column has space from the top down to row 7 (where there's a `*` at row 7, column 3).\n       - Dropping it vertically here would fill the gap in column 3 from rows 3 to 6.\n\n4. **Optimal Action**:\n   - Rotate the block to **90° (vertical)** and drop it in **column 3**.\n   - This will fill the gap in column 3 and not create new gaps or unevenness.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 3 90","To determine the best action for the given Tetris game board and current block, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\nThe current board has several occupied positions ('*') and empty positions ('.'). The goal is to place the current block (a 2x2 square in all rotations) in a position where it fits without overlapping existing blocks and ideally clears a row if possible.\n\n### Current Block:\nThe current block is a 2x2 square (O-block in Tetris terms), which looks the same in all rotations:\n```\n**\n**\n```\nThis means rotation doesn't change the block's shape, so the rotation angle doesn't matter for placement. We only need to decide the column (drop_coordinate) where the leftmost part of the block will land.\n\n### Possible Drop Coordinates:\nThe block is 2 units wide, so it can be dropped in columns 1 through 9 (since column 10 would make the block extend beyond the board). \n\nWe need to find a column where:\n1. The block can fit without overlapping existing '*' on the board.\n2. The block lands on top of existing '*' or the bottom of the board.\n\n### Board Height Analysis:\nLet's look at the height of the stacks in each column (from the bottom up, row 10 is the bottom):\n- Column 1: Occupied in rows 8, 9, 10 (height ~3)\n- Column 2: Occupied in rows 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (height ~9)\n- Column 3: Occupied in rows 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (height ~8)\n- Column 4: Occupied in rows 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 (height ~5)\n- Column 5: Occupied in rows 4, 6, 7, 8, 10 (height ~5)\n- Column 6: Occupied in rows 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (height ~6)\n- Column 7: Occupied in rows 4, 6, 7, 8, 10 (height ~5)\n- Column 8: Occupied in rows 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 (height ~5)\n- Column 9: Occupied in rows 6, 8, 10 (height ~3)\n- Column 10: Occupied in row 10 (height ~1)\n\n### Possible Placements:\nThe block is 2 units tall, so we need to find a column where the block can sit on top of existing '*' or the bottom. The best placements are where the block can fill gaps or clear rows.\n\nLooking at the board, the best place to drop the block is in column 1, where the block can sit on top of the existing stack in column 1 (rows 8, 9, 10) and column 2 (rows 2-10). The block will land at row 7 (since row 8 is occupied in column 1 and 2).\n\n### Final Placement:\n- Drop coordinate: 1 (leftmost column of the block)\n- Rotation angle: 0 (since rotation doesn't change the block)\n\nThis will place the block in columns 1-2, rows 7-8, filling the space without overlapping and without clearing a row (no row is fully occupied after placement).\n\nAnswer: 1 0","To determine the best action for the current Tetris game, let's analyze the board and the possible placements of the current block.\n\n### Current Block Rotations:\n1. **0° rotation**:\n   ```\n   0*0\n   ***\n   ```\n   - Width: 3, Height: 2\n   - The block is a T-shape with the middle square of the top row and all three squares of the bottom row filled.\n\n2. **90° rotation**:\n   ```\n   *0\n   **\n   *0\n   ```\n   - Width: 2, Height: 3\n   - The block is a vertical T-shape with the top and bottom squares of the left column and the entire middle column filled.\n\n3. **180° rotation**:\n   ```\n   ***\n   0*0\n   ```\n   - Width: 3, Height: 2\n   - The block is an upside-down T-shape with all three squares of the top row and the middle square of the bottom row filled.\n\n4. **270° rotation**:\n   ```\n   0*\n   **\n   0*\n   ```\n   - Width: 2, Height: 3\n   - The block is a vertical T-shape with the top and bottom squares of the right column and the entire middle column filled.\n\n### Board Analysis:\nThe board has some uneven terrain with peaks and valleys. The goal is to place the block in a way that:\n1. Does not exceed the top boundary.\n2. Minimizes gaps or unevenness after placement.\n3. Potentially clears a line (though this is unlikely given the current board state).\n\n### Possible Placements:\n1. **0° rotation**:\n   - Can be placed in columns 1 to 8 (since width is 3).\n   - The best fit seems to be around column 3 or 4 to fill gaps.\n\n2. **90° rotation**:\n   - Can be placed in columns 1 to 9 (since width is 2).\n   - The best fit seems to be around column 5 or 6 to fill gaps.\n\n3. **180° rotation**:\n   - Similar to 0°, but the shape is upside-down.\n   - Best fit seems to be around column 3 or 4.\n\n4. **270° rotation**:\n   - Similar to 90°, but mirrored.\n   - Best fit seems to be around column 5 or 6.\n\n### Optimal Placement:\nAfter evaluating, the **90° rotation** placed in column **5** seems to fit well, filling a gap in the middle of the board without creating new peaks.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: 5 90"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
