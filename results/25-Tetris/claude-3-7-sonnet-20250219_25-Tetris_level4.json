However, I need to consider how the current L-shape can be used most effectively.\n\nAfter examining the possible rotations and placements, I can see that rotating the block to 90° and placing it at column 7 would be beneficial. This would allow the block to fit nicely on the right side of the board, potentially setting up for future line clears without creating difficult-to-fill gaps.\n\nWith the 90° rotation (which is the L shape standing upright with the short part pointing left), placing it in column 7 would allow it to stack well with the existing blocks on the right side.\n\nAnswer: 7 90","I need to evaluate the best position and rotation for the current block to maximize my chances of clearing rows and avoiding stacking the board too high.\n\nLooking at the current board, I notice there are several gaps that need to be filled, particularly on the right side.

The 180° rotation (0**, **0) is similar to 0° but flipped.\n4. The 270° rotation (*0, **, 0*) is the same as 90° rotation.\n\nAfter examining the board, placing the block at column 9 with a 90° rotation seems optimal.

The right side has more space but also has some blocks that could interfere with placement.\n\nIf I place the block in rotation 90° at column 7, the T-shape will slot into the right side of the board, potentially setting up for a future line clear. The stem of the T would connect with existing blocks, creating a more stable structure.\n\nAfter careful consideration of all possible placements and rotations, I've determined that placing the T-block at column 7 with a 90° rotation provides the best strategic position for potential future line clears while maintaining a relatively low overall height.\n\nAnswer: 7 90"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

I have a T-shaped tetromino that I need to place.\n\nLet me analyze my options by considering each rotation and possible horizontal position:\n\nFor the 0° rotation (T shape upright):\n- This shape is 3 blocks wide and 2 blocks tall\n- Placing it so it connects with the existing blocks could be good for future setups\n\nFor the 90° rotation (T shape pointing right):\n- This shape is 2 blocks wide and 3 blocks tall\n- Could be placed alongside the existing blocks\n\nFor the 180° rotation (T shape upside down):\n- Similar to 0° but inverted, could be placed to create a cavity\n\nFor the 270° rotation (T shape pointing left):\n- Similar to 90° but mirrored\n\nI think the best option is to use the 0° rotation and place it directly adjacent to the existing blocks, creating a flat surface that will make future placements easier. I'll place it at position 3, which means the leftmost part of the \"T\" will be in column 3.\n\nThis will create a relatively flat surface on the bottom row while leaving a small indentation that could be filled by a future piece.\n\nAnswer: 3 0","I need to carefully analyze the game board and the current block to find the best placement.\n\nLooking at the current board, I see:\n```\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n...*......\n..***.....\n....**....\n....**....\n```\n\nThe current block is a T-shaped tetromino with the following rotation states:\n- 0°: `0*0`\n       `***`\n- 90°: `*0`\n        `**`\n        `*0`\n- 180°: `***`\n         `0*0`\n- 270°: `0*`\n         `**`\n         `0*`\n\nMy strategy is to place the block to potentially clear a row and create a stable structure.\n\nAfter analyzing the possibilities, I'll place the block at the 5th column with a 0° rotation.

I could place it horizontally (0° rotation) to potentially clear a row.\n\nThe best move appears to be placing the horizontal tetromino (0° rotation) in position 7. This would place it on the far right side of the board, completing a row that can be cleared.\n\nBy placing the horizontal tetromino (0° rotation) in column 7, I'll have:\n- The leftmost part of the tetromino starts at column 7\n- The tetromino extends to column 10\n- This will complete the row with the existing blocks, clearing a row and increasing the score\n\nThis placement creates a more balanced board structure for future pieces.\n\nAnswer: 7 0","I'll analyze this Tetris board and the current block to find the optimal move.\n\nThe current block is an L-shape (flipped L) with 4 possible rotations.

I should keep the board as flat as possible\n\nFor the current situation, I'm looking at several options:\n\nIf I use the 90° rotation and place it at column 1:\n- The block would fit nicely against the existing pieces at the bottom\n- This would create a relatively flat surface on top\n- It would leave no holes\n\nIf I use the 270° rotation and place it at column 3:\n- It would also fit well with the existing pieces\n\nLet me choose the 90° rotation at column 1, as this will create a good foundation and potentially set up for future line clears.\n\nAnswer: 1 90","I need to analyze the game board and determine the optimal placement for the current Tetris block.\n\nLooking at the current board, there's a partial structure on the left side with some blocks reaching up to the 4th row from the bottom. The current block is a Z-tetrimino, which has two possible orientations (0°\/180° or 90°\/270°).\n\nLet me evaluate possible placements:\n\n1. If I place it at column 3 with 90° rotation, it would fit nicely against the existing structure and continue building upward. This would create a relatively stable structure.\n\n2. If I place it further to the right, it would start a new column which might not be as efficient.\n\n3. If I use the 0° rotation, the block would be wider and might be harder to fit effectively.\n\nThe 90° rotation at column 3 appears to be the best option as it would create a more compact structure on the left side of the board.\n\nAnswer: 3 90","I need to determine the best move for this Tetris board with the given block.\n\nLooking at the current board, I see several potential placements for this block (an L-shape). Let me analyze the options:\n\n1. If I rotate the block to 270° and place it on the left side, I can complete a line which would increase the score.\n2. If I rotate the block to 90° and place it appropriately, I could also potentially set up for future line clears.\n\nThe 270° rotation of the block looks like:\n```\n0*\n0*\n**\n```\n\nIf I place this at position 1 (leftmost), the bottom two rows of the block would fill in gaps in the bottom row, potentially creating a complete line.\n\nLet me visualize this:\n- The block would have its leftmost part at column 1\n- The 270° rotation would place the vertical part on the left and the horizontal part at the bottom\n- This would complete the bottom row, causing it to clear\n\nThis is optimal because:\n1. It would immediately clear a line, increasing the score\n2. It creates a relatively flat playing field for future pieces\n3. It avoids building height on the left side where there's already a column\n\nTherefore, my decision is to place the block at position 1 with a 270° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 1 270","I need to carefully analyze the current Tetris board and the falling block, which is an I-tetromino (a straight line of 4 blocks).\n\nLooking at the board, I notice several key features:\n- There are blocks scattered primarily on the left side\n- The right side of the board is completely empty\n- There's an opportunity to clear a line if I place the I-tetromino horizontally\n\nFor this I-tetromino, I have two options:\n1. Place it vertically (90° or 270° rotation)\n2. Place it horizontally (0° or 180° rotation)\n\nIf I place it horizontally (0° rotation) at position 7, it would fill columns 7-10 of the bottom row, completing the line and earning a point. This seems optimal because:\n1. It clears a line, increasing the score\n2. It doesn't create any overhangs that would be difficult to fill later\n3. It keeps the right side of the board relatively clean\n\nAfter the block lands and the completed line is cleared, the blocks above would shift down one row, maintaining a clean playing field.\n\nAnswer: 7 0","I need to analyze the Tetris board and determine where to place the current block (a 2x2 square) to maximize the score.\n\nLooking at the current board:\n```\n..........\n.*........\n.*........\n**........\n**........\n*.........\n*.........\n*..*......\n****......\n.**...****\n```\n\nAnd my current block is a 2x2 square:\n```\n**\n**\n```\n\nSince this block is symmetrical, all rotation angles (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) result in the same shape.\n\nI need to decide where to place this block to potentially clear lines. The right side of the board has fewer blocks, so placing the block there could balance the board better.\n\nHowever, I notice that if I place the block in columns 3-4, I can complete a row:\n```\n..........\n.*........\n.*........\n**........\n**........\n*.........\n*.........\n*..*......\n****......\n.****.****  <- This row would be cleared\n```\n\nThis would give me 1 point and maintain a relatively even distribution of blocks.\n\nAnswer: 3 0","I need to analyze the current Tetris board and decide where to place the 'S' shaped block (the current block) to maximize my score.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n```\n..........\n.*........\n.*........\n**........\n**........\n*.**......\n*.**......\n*..*......\n****......\n.**...****\n```\n\nAnd I have an S-shape block (a.k.a. \"Z\" Tetromino) with four possible rotations.\n\nFirst, let me evaluate potential placements:\n\n1.

Drop in columns 9-10: Would build on the existing blocks on the right\n\nThe best option seems to be columns 3-4, as this would fill in a gap and create a more even surface.

The 90° and 270° rotations are taller and might be harder to place effectively.\n\nAfter examining all possibilities, I believe placing the block in rotation 180° at position 7 would be optimal.

This simplifies my decision-making since rotation won't change the block's shape.\n\nLooking at the board, I notice there are several potential placement options. Since the goal in Tetris is typically to clear lines and avoid building height, I'll look for placements that might complete rows or create flat surfaces.\n\nThe best option appears to be placing the square block at column 8, which would fill in the rightmost area and potentially create a clearer playing field:\n\n- Placing at column 8 would stack the block in the right area where there are fewer blocks currently\n- This avoids building up the left side which already has more height\n\nWith this placement, the block will land at the bottom of the board, adding to the structure without creating dangerous overhangs or holes.\n\nAnswer: 8 0","I'll analyze this Tetris board and provide the best move for the current T-shaped block.\n\nLooking at the current board, I notice there's a deep well on the right side and some gaps on the left side.

The 0° and 180° rotations have the same shape, as do the 90° and 270° rotations.\n\nOption 1: Place the block at 0° rotation around column 7 or 8. This would fill some of the gap but might leave awkward spaces.\n\nOption 2: Place the block at 90° rotation. This vertical orientation could be better for filling gaps.\n\nLooking at column 8 with a 90° rotation, I can place the Z-tetromino so that it connects with existing blocks while maintaining a relatively flat surface. This would stack efficiently on the right side where there's currently a gap, and it would avoid creating overhangs or isolated holes.\n\nThe 90° rotation placed at column 8 would have the block's leftmost piece align with column 8, and would rest nicely on top of the existing structure.\n\nAnswer: 8 90","I'll analyze the Tetris board and determine the best move for the current block.\n\nLooking at the current block, it's a T-shaped tetrimino with four possible rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°).\n\nThe board has several existing structures with some gaps that could be filled.

This would:\n1. Fill the gap in the bottom row\n2. Create a more even surface for future blocks\n3. Not create problematic overhangs\n\nWith this placement, the block would fit well into the existing structure without creating new isolated holes.\n\nAnswer: 3 90","I need to determine where to place the current block to maximize my score.

Generally in Tetris, it's best to keep the board as flat as possible and avoid creating \"holes\" that are difficult to fill later.\n\nFor a 2x2 block, I would typically place it at the edge of the board to maintain flexibility for future pieces.

I should try to build on this foundation while creating opportunities to clear lines.\n\nFor the L-shaped piece:\n- The 0° rotation would fit well on the right side of the existing blocks\n- The 90° rotation could sit directly on top of the existing blocks\n- The 180° rotation could also fit next to the existing blocks\n- The 270° rotation has a good fit next to the existing blocks\n\nAfter analyzing the options, placing the block in the 3rd column with a 0° rotation seems optimal.

I notice there are several gaps in the structure that could be filled.\n\nIn this case, the best move would be to rotate the block to 90° (vertical orientation) and place it in column 2. This would fill gaps in the existing structure and create a complete row at the bottom.\n\nWith this move:\n- The block will drop vertically down column 2\n- It will fill spaces in rows 7, 8, 9, and 10\n- This will complete row 10, clearing it and earning a point\n\nAfter this placement, the board will be more stable and have fewer gaps.\n\nAnswer: 2 90","I need to find the best placement for the current I-tetrimino (a straight line of 4 blocks) to maximize score and maintain a good board position.\n\nLooking at the current board, I notice there's a potential for clearing a row if I can place the tetrimino effectively. The bottom row is already almost filled, with just one empty space.\n\nOptions:\n1. Place horizontally (0° or 180° rotation) to fill gaps\n2. Place vertically (90° or 270° rotation) to potentially clear multiple rows\n\nAnalysis:\nIf I place the I-tetrimino vertically (90° rotation) in column 10, it would fill the last gap in the bottom row, creating a complete row which would be cleared, earning a point. This placement would also maintain a relatively clean board structure.\n\nSpecifically, if I place a vertically rotated tetrimino at column 10, it would fill positions at:\n- Row 7, Column 10\n- Row 8, Column 10\n- Row 9, Column 10\n- Row 10, Column 10\n\nThis would complete the bottom row, triggering a clear and earning a point.\n\nAnswer: 10 90","I'll analyze this Tetris board and determine the best move for the current block.\n\nThe current block is an L-shape that can be rotated in 4 ways.

There's a potential opportunity to complete a row if I place the block correctly.\n\nAfter examining all possible placements, I believe the optimal move is to rotate the block 270° and place it in column 7. This will put the block as:\n```\n0*\n0*\n**\n```\nin columns 7-8. This fills in more of the bottom row, and keeps the board relatively flat, preventing any tall columns that could create problems later.\n\nWith this placement, the L-block will fall and rest with its bottom part in the 9th and 10th rows, and the vertical part extending upward, helping to fill in the rightmost area of the board.\n\nAnswer: 7 270","I'll analyze this Tetris board and determine the best move for the current S-shaped piece.\n\nLooking at the current board, I see there's a significant gap in the middle-right area where I should aim to place the piece to efficiently use space and potentially set up for future line clears.

The game will forcibly end after the 100th round or if a block exceeds the top boundary of the board when placed. If an entire row becomes fully occupied, it will automatically be cleared, increasing the score by 1.The block will continue to fall until it is obstructed by another block or reaches the bottom of the board.\n\n- On the board:\n  - '*' represents a square occupied by a block.\n  - '.' represents an empty square.\n\n- The current block information includes its shape and rotation state:\n  - '*' represents squares occupied by the current block.\n  - '0' represents empty spaces.\n\nYou must provide your action in the format:  \n'Answer: [drop_coordinate] [rotation_angle]' ,e.g. 'Answer: 4 90'.\nwhere:\n- '[drop_coordinate]' refers to the leftmost square of the block relative to the board, ranging from 1 (leftmost) to 10 (rightmost).\n- '[rotation_angle]' represents the rotation applied to the current falling block, provided explicitly in the game information, where '*' denotes block squares and '0' denotes empty spaces.\nFor example, if the board is:\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n......**..\n**..****..\n**...**...\nand the Current Block is:  \n0°:\n0**\n**0\n90°:\n*0\n**\n0*\n180°:\n0**\n**0\n270°:\n*0\n**\n0*\nIf the provided action is 'Answer: 3 90', the leftmost square of the block rotated by 90° will land in the third column of the board, and the board will become:\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..*...**..\n********..\n**.*.**...\n\nThe current game board is:\nEpoch: 17\nScore: 0\nBoard:\n......***.\n......***.\n**.**.****\n**..*..***\n*...*..**.\n***.*****.\n*.****.*.*\n*.****.*.*\n***..*****\n*..****..*\nCurrent Block (rotations):\n0°:\n0**\n**0\n90°:\n*0\n**\n0*\n180°:\n0**\n**0\n270°:\n*0\n**\n0*\n\n\n","action":"1 90","width":10,"height":10,"response":["Looking at the game board and the current block, I'll analyze the best move.\n\nThe board is completely empty, so I have the opportunity to place the block anywhere. The current block is an L-shape tetrimino.\n\nSince Tetris scoring depends on clearing rows, I want to position blocks efficiently to maximize future line clears. Typically, it's good to place blocks along the edges early in the game to create stable columns.\n\nFor this L-shaped block:\n- In 0° rotation, it has a 3x2 footprint with a tail on the top-right\n- In 90° rotation, it has a 2x3 footprint with the stem on the left\n- In 180° rotation, it has a 3x2 footprint with a tail on the bottom-left\n- In 270° rotation, it has a 2x3 footprint with the stem on the right\n\nThe 180° rotation would be ideal to place against the left wall, which will create a solid base while maintaining an even surface for future blocks.\n\nIn the 180° rotation (***\\n*00), I'll place it at column 1, which will result in the block landing at the bottom left of the board.\n\nAnswer: 1 180","I need to decide where to place the I-tetromino (the long straight piece) on the current board.\n\nLooking at the current board:\n```\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n***.......\n*.........\n```\n\nAnd the current block in its various rotations:\n- 0°: `****` (horizontal)\n- 90°: `*` (vertical)\n    `*`\n    `*`\n    `*`\n- 180°: `****` (same as 0°)\n- 270°: `*` (same as 90°)\n    `*`\n    `*`\n    `*`\n\nI have two main strategy options:\n1. Place the I-tetromino horizontally to clear the existing row at the bottom\n2. Place the I-tetromino vertically to build up for future Tetrises\n\nSince the board is mostly empty and we're only at epoch 2, I think clearing the line now makes the most sense to get an early score.\n\nTo clear the line, I'll place the I-tetromino horizontally (0° rotation) at position 4, which will complete the bottom row.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","I need to determine the best placement for the current I-shaped tetromino (straight piece) to maximize score potential.\n\nLooking at the current board:\n```\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n***.......\n*..****...\n```\n\nI notice there's a 3-block pattern on the left and a row with 4 blocks on the right in the bottom row.\n\nLet's consider the possible placements:\n\n1. I could place the I-piece vertically (90° or 270° rotation) at various positions\n2. I could place the I-piece horizontally (0° or 180° rotation) at various positions\n\nThe optimal strategy here is to place the I-piece horizontally to complete the bottom row, which will clear that row and give me a point.\n\nIf I place the I-piece in column 6 with 0° rotation, it will fill positions 6-9 in the bottom row, completing that row and clearing it.\n\nThe updated board would look like:\n```\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n***.......\n```\n\nThis clears one row and leaves the board in a cleaner state for future pieces.\n\nAnswer: 6 0","I need to determine the best placement for the current I-shaped tetromino (a straight line of 4 blocks) to maximize score potential.\n\nLooking at the current board, there are several gaps that need to be filled:\n- There's a gap at the leftmost position of the bottom row\n- There's a gap in the second column of the bottom row\n- There are some other scattered gaps\n\nFor the I-shaped tetromino, I have two orientation options:\n- Horizontal (0° or 180°): ****\n- Vertical (90° or 270°): A column of 4 blocks\n\nGiven the current board state, I see a good opportunity to place the I tetromino vertically in the first column. This would fill the leftmost gap in the bottom row while efficiently using the piece. If I place it at position 1 with a 90° rotation, it will:\n1. Fill the gap in the bottom-left corner\n2. Stack efficiently without creating awkward gaps\n3. Set up for potential future line clears\n\nAnswer: 1 90","I need to analyze the current Tetris board and find the optimal placement for the current block.\n\nLooking at the board, I notice that:\n- There are 2 rows with several occupied spaces at the bottom\n- There's a vertical column of blocks on the left side\n- I need to be strategic about where to place the next block to avoid creating gaps\n\nThe current block is what's commonly known as an \"L\" piece, with 4 different rotation states.\n\nMy analysis:\n- Placing the block in a way that could complete a row would be ideal\n- I should avoid creating \"holes\" that are difficult to fill later\n- The 90° rotation (vertical L shape) could be useful to fill along the left side\n\nAfter examining all possible positions and rotations, I believe the best move is to place the block at position 5 with a 270° rotation. This will:\n- Fill in the right side gap at the bottom row\n- Create a more even surface for future pieces\n- Not create any inaccessible holes\n\nWhen placed at position 5 with 270° rotation, the block will stack efficiently with the existing blocks on the right side of the board.\n\nAnswer: 5 270","I need to analyze the current Tetris board and decide where to place the I-shaped tetromino (the straight line piece).\n\nLooking at the board, I can see there's a gap in the far right that could be filled to clear a row. I also notice there's a column of blocks on the left side.\n\nIf I place the I-shape vertically (90° or 270° rotation), I could potentially clear one row. If I place it horizontally (0° or 180° rotation), I might not be able to clear any rows immediately, but it could set up for future moves.\n\nThe best move here is to place the I-tetromino vertically in the gap at column 10. This would allow me to clear one row and create a cleaner board.\n\nWith a 90° rotation (making the piece a vertical line), I'll place it at column 10:\n\nThis would result in:\n1. The I-piece filling the rightmost column from rows 6-9\n2. The bottom row becomes completely filled\n3. The bottom row gets cleared, increasing the score by 1\n\nAnswer: 10 90","Looking at the current game board and the falling block, I need to decide where to place it for optimal results.\n\nThe current board has several occupied squares, with a notable partial structure on the left and some filled spaces towards the right side. The score is 0, and we're at epoch 7.\n\nThe current block is an L-tetromino with the following rotations:\n- 0°: A horizontal 3-block line with an additional block at the right end of the top row\n- 90°: A vertical 2-block line with 2 blocks to the right at the bottom\n- 180°: A horizontal 3-block line with an additional block at the left end of the bottom row\n- 270°: A vertical 2-block line with 2 blocks to the left at the top\n\nMy strategy is to place the block to potentially clear a line while avoiding creating uneven surfaces or holes.\n\nAfter analyzing the possible placements:\n- I'll use the 270° rotation and place it at column 7\n- This will fill the right side of the bottom row, creating a complete line that will be cleared\n\nWith this placement, the block will fall and fill positions at columns 7, 8, 9 in row 10 and column 7 in row 9, completing the bottom row which will then be cleared. This will increase the score by 1 and create a cleaner board state.\n\nAnswer: 7 270","I need to analyze the current board and determine the best placement for the given block to maximize my chances of success.\n\nLooking at the board, I see there are some potential gaps and structures to consider:\n- There's a gap at the right side of the board that could be filled\n- There's a column building up on the left side\n- The middle area has some scattered blocks\n\nLet me analyze the different possible rotations of the block:\n\nFor the S-shaped block (or Z-shaped, depending on perspective):\n- At 0° or 180°: It forms a horizontal S shape (0**, **0)\n- At 90° or 270°: It forms a vertical S shape (*0, **, 0*)\n\nConsidering the current board configuration, I want to avoid building the stack too high in any single column. Looking at the board, there's space on the right side where I could place this block to potentially set up for a future line clear.\n\nAfter analyzing the possibilities, I believe placing the block with a 90° rotation at position 8 would be optimal. This will allow the block to fit into the existing structure on the right side of the board without creating any inaccessible gaps.\n\nAnswer: 8 90","I need to decide where to place the current Z-shaped tetrimino for maximum benefit. Let me analyze the board and potential placements.\n\nLooking at the board, there are several gaps and potential rows that could be completed with a good placement. Since the Z piece can create problematic overhangs, I want to place it where it either:\n1. Completes a row\n2. Fits neatly without creating unreachable gaps\n\nThe board has some structure in the right side, with columns 7-10 having more filled cells. I notice there's a potential to fill some spaces on the left or middle of the board.\n\nAfter examining all possibilities with different rotations and positions:\n\nWith a 90° rotation, placing the block at position 4 would allow it to fit well into the existing structure. The leftmost piece would be at column 4, and it would stack on top of the existing blocks without creating unreachable holes. This would maintain a relatively flat profile for future pieces.\n\nWith this placement at position 4 with 90° rotation, the Z piece will fit well with the existing structure without creating problematic gaps.\n\nAnswer: 4 90","I'll analyze this Tetris game board and determine the best move for the current block.\n\nLooking at the current board, I see there's a fairly uneven surface with some columns built up higher than others. The current block appears to be an \"L\" shape in its various rotations.\n\nMy goal is to place the block where it can:\n1. Complete a row if possible\n2. Create a flat structure for future placements\n3. Avoid creating holes that can't be filled later\n\nLet me check each possible rotation and placement:\n\nThe 0° rotation (00* \/ ***) has a shape that could be useful for filling in the left side of the board.\n\nThe 90° rotation (*0 \/ *0 \/ **) could fit nicely in column 1 or 2, which would help level the left side.\n\nThe 180° rotation (*** \/ *00) might work well on the right side.\n\nThe 270° rotation (** \/ 0* \/ 0*) could be placed to minimize creating holes.\n\nAfter analyzing all possibilities, I believe the best move is to place the block at column 2 with a 270° rotation. This will help fill in the left side without creating inaccessible holes.\n\nAnswer: 2 270","Looking at the current game board, I need to place a 2x2 square block (which is identical in all rotations) in the optimal position.\n\nThe current board has several potential places to drop the block. I need to analyze where placing this block would be most beneficial, potentially setting up for row clears.\n\nLooking at the board, I notice:\n- The leftmost columns have several gaps\n- The bottom right has some structure\n- Row 6 (counting from bottom) has a gap on the far left\n\nSince the block is a 2x2 square, I want to place it where it could potentially complete a row, or at least not create awkward gaps.\n\nThe best move appears to be dropping the block in column 1 (the leftmost position). This would:\n1. Fill in gaps in the left side of the board\n2. Create a more even structure\n3. Potentially set up future line clears\n\nSince all rotations of this block are identical (it's a 2x2 square), any rotation angle yields the same result. I'll use the default 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","Looking at the current game board and the available rotations for the falling block, I need to determine the optimal placement to maximize score and maintain a clean board structure.\n\nThe board already has some existing blocks, with the highest occupied cell in the third row from the top. The current block is an L-shape, and I need to decide where to place it to potentially clear lines.\n\nAfter analyzing the possible placements and rotations:\n\n1. In the 0° rotation, the block occupies 4 squares in an L shape.\n2. In the 90° rotation, it also occupies 4 squares but in a different configuration.\n3. The 180° rotation is an inverted L.\n4. The 270° rotation is another variation.\n\nI notice there are several gaps in the lower part of the board. By placing the block with a 270° rotation at column 4, I can potentially clear a row and maintain a relatively balanced board height.\n\nAnswer: 4 270","I need to analyze this Tetris board and determine the best move for the current block, which is a 2x2 square (all rotations are identical).\n\nLooking at the current board, I see several potential placement options:\n\n1. The leftmost columns (1-2) have varying heights but would create overhangs\n2. Columns 3-4 have a small gap that could be filled\n3. Columns 5-6 have a decent landing spot\n4. Columns 7-8 have some space\n5. Columns 9-10 are mostly empty\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n- Placing at column 1 would create an unstable structure\n- Placing at column 3 would fit into a gap but might create holes\n- Placing at column 5 would create a relatively flat surface\n- Placing at column 9 would be a safe placement with room for future blocks\n\nAfter analyzing the entire board, I believe placing the block at column 9 (with any rotation since it's a square) would be the best move. This placement avoids creating holes and maintains a good structure for future blocks.\n\nAnswer: 9 0","Looking at the current board and the available block, I need to determine the optimal placement for the Z-shaped tetrimino.\n\nThe current board already has many blocks scattered across the bottom rows with a few gaps. I need to consider where to place the Z-tetrimino to avoid creating gaps underneath and potentially set up for line clears.\n\nAfter analyzing the board, I notice there's a good opportunity to place the block at column 7 with 0° rotation. This would fill the area nicely:\n\n- At column 7 with 0° rotation, the Z-block would fit cleanly against the existing structure\n- This placement avoids creating empty spaces underneath the placed block\n- It doesn't build the stack too high in any single column\n\nTherefore, my solution is to place the Z-tetrimino at column 7 with 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 7 0","I need to analyze the current Tetris board and determine the best move for the current block.\n\nLooking at the current board, I notice several gaps that might be filled. I need to consider which placement and rotation would maximize my chances of clearing rows and minimizing height.\n\nThe current block is an L-shape with four possible rotations. Let me analyze each possibility:\n\nFor the 0° rotation (00* \/ ***), this block could be positioned to fill some gaps on the left side of the board or help complete rows.\n\nFor the 90° rotation (*0 \/ *0 \/ **), this could be good for filling vertical gaps.\n\nFor the 180° rotation (*** \/ *00), this might work well to cover horizontal spaces.\n\nFor the 270° rotation (** \/ 0* \/ 0*), this could fill certain vertical patterns.\n\nAfter analyzing the board, I see there's an opportunity to potentially clear a row by using the 180° rotation. If I place the block at column 7 with 180° rotation, I can complete a row and potentially set up for future clearances.\n\nAnswer: 7 180","I need to analyze this Tetris game state and determine the optimal placement for the current Z-shaped block.\n\nLooking at the board, I notice several potential placements:\n- The board has some gaps that could be filled\n- I want to avoid creating isolated holes that are difficult to fill later\n- I should try to complete rows if possible\n\nThe current block is a Z-shaped tetromino which can be rotated in 4 ways, though there are only 2 unique orientations (0°\/180° and 90°\/270°).\n\nAfter analyzing the board, I see that placing the block at column 1 with 90° rotation would be best. This will place the block so that:\n- The bottom part fills a gap in the leftmost columns\n- The block will stack well with existing pieces\n- It avoids creating new inaccessible holes\n\nWith this placement, the Z-tetromino will fall into the left side of the board, helping to balance the height across the board and filling some existing gaps.\n\nAnswer: 1 90"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
