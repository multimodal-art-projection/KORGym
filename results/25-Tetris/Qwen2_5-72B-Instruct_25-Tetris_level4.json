Given the current board is completely empty, our primary goal is to place the block in a way that minimizes potential holes and sets up the board for efficient future placements.\n\nThe block has the following shapes:\n- 0°: \n```\n*00\n***\n```\n- 90°: \n```\n**\n*0\n*0\n```\n- 180°: \n```\n***\n00*\n```\n- 270°: \n```\n0*\n0*\n**\n```\n\nPlacing the block at 0° or 180° would create a more compact shape that can potentially fill rows more efficiently in the future. Placing it at 90° or 270° would leave gaps that could be harder to fill later.\n\nGiven the symmetry and the need to avoid creating holes, placing the block at 0° or 180° in the center of the board seems optimal. Let's choose the 0° rotation and place it in the middle to start building a solid base.\n\nThus, the best move is to place the block at the 5th column (center) with no rotation.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","To determine the best move, let's analyze the current board and the possible rotations of the block:\n\n1. **Current Board Analysis:**\n   - The board has a few blocks at the bottom center, specifically in columns 5, 6, and 7.\n   - There is a gap above these blocks that needs to be filled to create a full row.\n\n2. **Block Analysis:**\n   - The block has four possible rotations:\n     - 0°: \n       ```\n       *00\n       ***\n       ```\n     - 90°:\n       ```\n       **\n       *0\n       *0\n       ```\n     - 180°:\n       ```\n       ***\n       00*\n       ```\n     - 270°:\n       ```\n       0*\n       0*\n       **\n       ```\n\n3. **Possible Moves:**\n   - **0° Rotation:**\n     - Dropping at column 4 or 5 would place the block in a way that fills the gap but leaves some holes.\n   - **90° Rotation:**\n     - Dropping at column 5 would place the block perfectly to fill the gap and create a full row.\n   - **180° Rotation:**\n     - Dropping at column 5 or 6 would not fill the gap effectively.\n   - **270° Rotation:**\n     - Dropping at column 5 would also fill the gap but might leave some holes.\n\nGiven the analysis, the best move is to use the 90° rotation and drop the block at column 5.

They can potentially fill gaps but might create new gaps or holes.\n   - **90° and 270°:** These orientations are also identical and have an L-shape. They can fit into the gaps more effectively.\n\n4. **Best Fit:**\n   - Placing the block at 90° or 270° in the third column (leftmost square at column 3) will help fill the gaps and minimize the creation of new holes.\n\n5. **Final Decision:**\n   - Dropping the block at 90° in the third column will fit well and potentially clear a row if it aligns correctly with the existing blocks.\n\nThus, the optimal move is to drop the block at the third column and rotate it by 90 degrees.\n\nAnswer: 3 90","To determine the best move, we need to consider the placement that minimizes gaps and maximizes the potential for clearing lines. Given the current block and the board state, placing the block at the center or slightly off-center can help fill in the gaps and prepare for future blocks.\n\nLet's analyze the rotations:\n\n- **0°**: This rotation will fit well if placed around the middle columns, as it can fill in the gaps without creating new holes.\n- **90°**: This rotation is less favorable because it creates more gaps.\n- **180°**: Similar to 0° but might not align as well with the existing blocks.\n- **270°**: Also creates more gaps and is less favorable.\n\nConsidering the board state, placing the block at 0° rotation around the 5th or 6th column seems optimal. Let's choose the 5th column to minimize gaps and potentially clear a line.\n\nFinal decision: Place the block at the 5th column with 0° rotation.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","To determine the best move, we need to consider the placement and rotation of the current block to maximize the score and maintain a clear path for future blocks. Given the current board and the block's shape, the best strategy is to place the block horizontally at the bottom to fill gaps and potentially clear rows.\n\nHere’s the analysis:\n- Placing the block at 0° or 180° (horizontal orientation) can help fill gaps and possibly clear rows.\n- Placing the block at 90° or 270° (vertical orientation) would not be as effective because it would create gaps and not clear any rows.\n\nGiven the current board, placing the block horizontally at the bottom would be the most effective. The best position to drop the block is in the first column to fill the gaps and potentially clear the bottom row.\n\nThus, the optimal move is to drop the block at the first column with no rotation.\n\nAnswer: 1 0"],"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
