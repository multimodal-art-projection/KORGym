We can also select any rotation angle because all rotations of the block look the same.\n\nLet's place the block at the center of the board for symmetry and simplicity. The leftmost square of the block should be positioned at column 5, so the block covers columns 5 and 6. Since rotation doesn't change the appearance of the block, we can choose any rotation angle; let's go with 0° for simplicity.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","To solve this Tetris problem, we need to find the optimal position and rotation for the current block to maximize our chances of clearing lines or setting up future blocks. Given the current board and the available rotations for the current block, we can analyze each option.\n\nThe current board has two blocks at the bottom in the middle, and the current block is an \"S\" piece, which can rotate into two orientations: one horizontal and one vertical.\n\nLet's evaluate both rotations:\n\n1. **0° Rotation**:\n   - This orientation places the block horizontally. We can drop it directly above the existing blocks at the bottom to potentially set up for a future block to clear a line.\n   - If we place it directly above the existing blocks, the leftmost square of the block would be at column 5, so the coordinates would be (5, 0).\n\n2. **90° Rotation**:\n   - This orientation places the block vertically. Dropping it in the center might also be beneficial, but it could interfere with future placements.\n   - If we place it vertically centered over the existing blocks, the leftmost square would be at column 6, so the coordinates would be (6, 90).\n\nGiven these options, placing the block horizontally seems to offer better flexibility for future moves.\n\nThus, the best move here would be to drop the block horizontally (0° rotation) at column 5.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","To determine the best action for the current Tetris game state, let's analyze the given board and the available block rotations.

The leftmost coordinate for this block to fit perfectly would be 8, as it would align with the three blocks already present.\n\nTherefore, the action should be to rotate the block 90 degrees and drop it at the 8th column.\n\nAnswer: 8 90","To solve the given Tetris scenario, we need to decide the best position and rotation for the current block to maximize the potential for clearing rows and maintain a stable structure.

The block can form an \"L\" shape when rotated 90° and 270°, and a straight line with a bump when at 0° and 180°.\n\nLooking at the board, placing the block at the right side could help fill gaps and possibly set up for future blocks. Placing it rotated 90° at column 6 would fill the gap at the bottom and set up the possibility of clearing the bottom row in the future with additional blocks.\n\nThus, the optimal move would be to rotate the block 90° and drop it starting from column 6.\n\nAnswer: 6 90","To solve the given Tetris scenario, we need to determine where to place the current block to optimize our chances of clearing lines while ensuring the block fits within the board's boundaries.

The current block can be placed in several positions, but the most strategic placement would be to complete the bottom two rows.\n\nLooking at the bottom two rows:\n```\n***..***..\n*....*.*..\n```\nWe need to fill in the gaps.

Notably, there is space in the middle rows that could be filled to complete the fourth row from the bottom.\n\nTo fill this space effectively, the leftmost square of the block should be placed at position 5 (considering the first column as position 1). This will allow the block to fill the gap between the existing blocks in the 4th row from the bottom, potentially leading to a row clearance.\n\nSince the block shape does not change with rotation, the rotation angle doesn't affect the placement strategy here.\n\nThus, the optimal move would be to place the block at coordinate 5 without rotating it.\n\nAnswer: 5 0","To solve this problem, we need to determine the best position and rotation for the current block so that it fits optimally into the game board without causing any rows to be completely filled prematurely, thus preserving our options for future blocks.\n\nGiven the current state of the board:\n```\n..........\n..........\n..........\n....**....\n....**....\n....**....\n.....***..\n.....*.*..\n***..***..\n*....*.*..\n```\n\nAnd the current block (which has the same shape for both 0° and 180° rotations, and the same for 90° and 270° rotations):\n```\n0°\/180°:\n**0\n0**\n\n90°\/270°:\n0*\n**\n*0\n```\n\nWe can see that placing the block at 90° or 270° would create a more compact structure, potentially avoiding gaps and setting up for future blocks.

Therefore, the rotation angle does not affect the placement strategy for this block.\n\nThe current board has a 2x2 block already placed at the bottom starting from the fifth column. To maximize the chances of clearing a line in future moves, placing the current block directly above the existing block would be a good strategy. This means placing the block with its leftmost square at coordinate 4, which will result in filling up the bottom two rows completely and clearing them.\n\nTherefore, the optimal action is to place the block without rotating it, with the leftmost square at position 4.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","To solve this Tetris scenario, we need to place the current block in a way that maximizes the potential for clearing lines and stabilizing the board without causing the block to exceed the top boundary.\n\nGiven the current board state and the current block which is a straight line (I-block), the best approach would be to place it vertically since the horizontal placement won't clear any lines and may lead to instability. We can place the vertical I-block in the middle of the board to avoid any immediate instability issues and potentially set up for future line clears.\n\nConsidering the positions of existing blocks and the size of the board, placing the I-block starting at the 5th column (which is the middle of the board) vertically should be optimal.
