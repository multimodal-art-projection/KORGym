Fits _A___, R is in 3rd, uses C, G, O.\n- BRAND: B R A N D. Doesn't fit _A___ pattern.\n- MANOR: M A N O R. Fits _A___, R is in 5th, uses M, N, O.\n- FAVOR: F A V O R. Fits _A___, R is in 5th, uses F, V, O.\n- DWARF: D W A R F. Doesn't fit _A___ pattern. (Wait, DWARF has A in 3rd position, not 2nd).\n- BARON: B A R O N. Fits _A___, R is in 3rd, uses B, O, N.\n- HARDY: H A R D Y. Fits _A___, R is in 3rd, uses H, D, Y.\n- VALOR: V A L O R. Fits _A___, R is in 5th, uses V, L, O.\n- CRANK: C R A N K. Doesn't fit _A___ pattern.\n- AWARD: A W A R D. Doesn't fit _A___ pattern.\n\nLet's reconsider DWARF. The A must be in the second position. So DWARF is not a valid option based on the first guess.\nLet's reconsider BRAND. A is in the third position, not second. Not valid.\nLet's reconsider CRANK. A is in the third position, not second. Not valid.\n\nOkay, focusing on words with A in the second position: _ A _ _ _\nAnd R in position 3, 4, or 5.\nAnd no I, S, E.\n\nPossible words again:\n- Position 3 for R: _ A R _ _ (Examples: BARON, CARGO, FARGO, HARDY, LARGO, MARCO, TAROT, VAPOR)\n- Position 4 for R: _ A _ R _ (Examples: BRAVO maybe? B A R V O? No, A is 2nd. Think of words like _ A _ R _. QUARK maybe Q A U R K? AWARD maybe A W A R D? No, A is 2nd. Maybe BAYOU doesn't have R. What about _ A _ R _ ? Maybe CAROL C A R O L ? No, R is 3rd. Maybe MAJOR M A J O R ? No, R is 5th. Words with _ A _ R _ are less common. Perhaps GUARD G U A R D? No A is 3rd. Maybe PAYOR P A Y O R?)\n- Position 5 for R: _ A _ _ R (Examples: MANOR, MAJOR, FAVOR, LABOR, VALOR, VAPOR)\n\nLet's choose a guess that tests R in a likely position (3rd or 5th) and uses common unused letters (like O, N, L, T, D, C).\n'CARGO' tests R in 3rd and C, G, O.\n'MANOR' tests R in 5th and M, N, O.\n'BARON' tests R in 3rd and B, N, O.\n'VALOR' tests R in 5th and V, L, O.\n'HARDY' tests R in 3rd and H, D, Y.\n\n'CARGO' seems like a strong candidate. It fits the pattern, places R in the middle, and introduces three new common letters.\n\nAnswer: CARGO","Okay, let's analyze the clues from the first two guesses.\n\n1.  **RAISE:**\n    *   R is in the word but not in the first position (Yellow).\n    *   A is in the word and in the second position (Green).\n    *   I is not in the word (Gray).\n    *   S is not in the word (Gray).\n    *   E is not in the word (Gray).\n2.  **CARGO:**\n    *   C is not in the word (Gray).\n    *   A is in the word and in the second position (Green). Confirms A is the second letter.\n    *   R is in the word and in the third position (Green). Confirms R is the third letter.\n    *   G is not in the word (Gray).\n    *   O is in the word but not in the fifth position (Yellow).\n\n**Summary of Information:**\n*   The word has 5 letters.\n*   The pattern is `_ A R _ _`.\n*   The letter R is confirmed in the 3rd position. (This also explains why R was yellow in the first guess - it wasn't in position 1).\n*   The letter A is confirmed in the 2nd position.\n*   The letter O is in the word, but not in the 5th position. Since positions 2 and 3 are filled (A, R), O must be in position 1 or 4.\n*   The letters I, S, E, C, G are not in the word.\n*   The first letter cannot be R (from guess 1).\n\n**Developing the Next Guess:**\n\n*   We know the word looks like `_ A R _ _`.\n*   We know O is present and must be in position 1 or 4.\n*   We know the letters I, S, E, C, G, R, A are excluded from the unknown positions (1, 4, 5). O is excluded from position 5.\n\n*   **Case 1: O is in position 1.** The word is `O A R _ _`. The last two letters cannot be I, S, E, C, G, R, A, O. Possible remaining letters include B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Words like OARDY, OARLY seem unlikely.\n*   **Case 2: O is in position 4.** The word is `_ A R O _`. The first letter cannot be R, C, G, I, S, E, A, O. The last letter cannot be O, I, S, E, C, G, R, A.\n    *   Let's try fitting common letters into `_ A R O _`.\n    *   Possible first letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n    *   Possible last letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n    *   Consider BARON: B is available, N is available. B is not R. N is not O. B, A, R, O, N contains A, R, O. It excludes I, S, E, C, G. This fits all the criteria perfectly.\n    *   Consider VALOR: V is available, L is available. Fits the pattern and constraints.\n    *   Consider HARPO: H is available, P is available. Fits the pattern and constraints.\n    *   Consider LARDO: L is available, D is available. Fits the pattern and constraints.\n    *   Consider MARON: M is available, N is available. Fits the pattern and constraints.\n\nBARON seems like a very strong candidate because it's a common word and fits all known constraints using plausible letters (B, N) that haven't been tested.\n\nMy next guess will be BARON.\n\nAnswer: BARON"],"have_image":true}

A common strategy is to use a word with frequently used letters, especially vowels. I'll start with 'RAISE'.\n\nAnswer: RAISE","Okay, let's analyze the first guess 'RAISE' and the feedback.\n1.  **R (Gray):** The letter 'R' is not in the secret word.\n2.  **A (Yellow):** The letter 'A' is in the secret word, but it is not in the second position.\n3.  **I (Green):** The letter 'I' is in the secret word and it is in the third position.\n4.  **S (Green):** The letter 'S' is in the secret word and it is in the fourth position.\n5.  **E (Gray):** The letter 'E' is not in the secret word.\n\nBased on this feedback, we know the following about the 5-letter secret word:\n*   The structure is `_ _ I S _`.\n*   The letter 'A' is present, but not in the second position. Since 'I' is in the third and 'S' is in the fourth, 'A' must be in the first or fifth position.\n*   The letters 'R' and 'E' are not present in the word.\n\nLet's consider the two possible patterns:\n\n**Pattern 1: `A _ I S _`**\n*   The first letter is 'A'.\n*   The third letter is 'I'.\n*   The fourth letter is 'S'.\n*   The second letter cannot be 'A', 'R', or 'E'.\n*   The fifth letter cannot be 'A', 'R', or 'E'.\n*   Possible words fitting this pattern and constraints:\n    *   AGIST (G, T are unused)\n    *   AMISS (M is unused, double S)\n    *   AVISO (V, O are unused)\n    *   ABYSS (B, Y are unused, double S)\n\n**Pattern 2: `_ _ I S A`**\n*   The third letter is 'I'.\n*   The fourth letter is 'S'.\n*   The fifth letter is 'A'.\n*   The first letter cannot be 'A', 'R', or 'E'.\n*   The second letter cannot be 'A', 'R', or 'E'.\n*   Let's look for words: VISTA? No, 'I' would be at position 2, not 3. PISAN? No, 'A' would be at position 4, not 5. This pattern seems less likely or yields less common words.\n\nComparing the candidates from Pattern 1 (`A _ I S _`), AGIST and AVISO introduce two new distinct letters each, which is generally a good strategy to narrow down possibilities. AMISS and ABYSS introduce one new letter but have a double 'S', which might be correct but is often better tested later if simpler options fail.\n\nBetween AGIST (testing G, T) and AVISO (testing V, O), the letters G, T, and O are quite common. Let's choose a word that tests common unused letters. AGIST uses G and T. AVISO uses V and O. T and O are very common. G is more common than V. AGIST seems like a strong strategic guess.\n\nMy next guess will be AGIST.\n\nAnswer: AGIST","Based on the information from the first two guesses:\n\n1.  **Guess 1 (RAISE):**\n    *   R, E are gray (not in the word).\n    *   A is yellow (in the word, but not in position 2).\n    *   I is green (in position 3).\n    *   S is green (in position 4).\n2.  **Guess 2 (AGIST):**\n    *   A is green (in position 1).

Since this is the very first attempt (attempt 0 out of 10) and the grid is empty, I need to make an initial guess. A good strategy for the first guess is to use a word with common letters and no repeated letters, if possible, to maximize the chances of getting yellow or green squares.\n\nFor a 6-letter word, some good starting words could be ORATES, SENIOR, RATION, or RAISED, as they contain frequently used letters like E, A, R, O, T, S, I, N.\n\nI will choose 'ORATES' as the first guess. It uses six distinct common letters: O, R, A, T, E, S.\n\nAnswer: ORATES","Based on the first guess 'ORATES':\n- The letters R, T, S are not in the secret word (gray).\n- The letters O, A, E are in the secret word (yellow).\n- O is not in the 1st position.\n- A is not in the 3rd position.\n- E is not in the 5th position.\n\nWe need a 6-letter word for the next guess that:\n1. Contains O, A, E.\n2. Does not contain R, T, S.\n3. Does not have O in position 1.\n4. Does not have A in position 3.\n5. Does not have E in position 5.\n6. Ideally introduces new common letters to maximize information gain.\n\nLet's try to construct a word following these rules. We need to place O, A, E in valid positions and fill the remaining 3 spots with letters not R, T, S.\nConsider placing the known letters A, O, E in new positions:\n- O can be in 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n- A can be in 1, 2, 4, 5, 6.\n- E can be in 1, 2, 3, 4, 6.\n\nLet's try placing E at the end (position 6). E is not in 5.\nLet's try placing O in position 2. O is not in 1.\nLet's try placing A in position 4. A is not in 3.\nThis gives us the pattern: _ O _ A _ E.\n\nNow we need to fill the blanks (positions 1, 3, 5) with letters other than R, T, S, O, A, E. Let's try common consonants like D, N, L.\nPlacing D in 1, N in 3, L in 5 gives DONALE.\nLet's check DONALE:\n- 6 letters long? Yes.\n- Contains O, A, E? Yes.\n- Excludes R, T, S? Yes.\n- O not in position 1? Yes (it's in 2).\n- A not in position 3? Yes (it's in 4).\n- E not in position 5? Yes (it's in 6).\n- Uses new common letters D, N, L? Yes.\n\nDONALE seems like a good strategic guess.\n\nAnswer: DONALE","Okay, let's analyze the clues from the first two guesses:\n\n1.  **ORATES**:\n    *   O: Yellow (present, wrong position - not 1st)\n    *   R: Gray (not present)\n    *   A: Yellow (present, wrong position - not 3rd)\n    *   T: Gray (not present)\n    *   E: Yellow (present, wrong position - not 5th)\n    *   S: Gray (not present)\n2.  **DONALE**:\n    *   D: Gray (not present)\n    *   O: Yellow (present, wrong position - not 2nd)\n    *   N: Gray (not present)\n    *   A: Yellow (present, wrong position - not 4th)\n    *   L: Gray (not present)\n    *   E: Yellow (present, wrong position - not 6th)\n\n**Summary of Information:**\n*   Letters definitely in the word: **O, A, E**\n*   Letters definitely NOT in the word: **R, T, S, D, N, L**\n*   Positional constraints:\n    *   O is NOT in position 1 or 2.\n    *   A is NOT in position 3 or 4.\n    *   E is NOT in position 5 or 6.\n\n**Strategy for Next Guess:**\nWe need a 6-letter word that:\n1.

This is allowed. I4 and T5 are green. The yellow A(pos3 in WRAITHER), E(pos7 in WRAITHER), R(pos8 in WRAITHER) are consistent with IRRITATE (A is not 3, E is not 7, R is not 8). The yellow E(pos3 in CREATION), A(pos4 in CREATION), I(pos6 in CREATION) are consistent (E is not 3, A is not 4, I is not 6). The yellow A(pos1 in ARBITERS), E(pos6 in ARBITERS), R(pos7 in ARBITERS) are consistent (A is not 1, E is not 6, R is not 7).\n\nThe word IRRITATE fits all the clues perfectly.\n\nAnswer: IRRITATE"],"have_image":true}

The goal is to guess the secret 11-letter word in at most 10 attempts. Since this is the first attempt, I need to choose a good starting word with common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained.\n\nFor an 11-letter word, a good starting word might be one containing several unique common letters and vowels. Considering common letters (E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U) and vowels (A, E, I, O, U), I will choose a word that fits these criteria.\n\nLet's evaluate some 11-letter words:\n- 'CREATIONIST': C, R, E, A, T, I, O, N, S (9 unique letters, 4 vowels: E, A, I, O)\n- 'ULTRASONIC': U, L, T, R, A, S, O, N, I, C (10 unique letters, 4 vowels: U, A, O, I)\n- 'AUTHORITIES': A, U, T, H, O, R, I, E, S (9 unique letters, 5 vowels: A, U, O, I, E)\n\n'AUTHORITIES' seems like a strong choice because it includes all five main vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (T, H, R, S). It has 11 letters as required.\n\nMy first guess is 'AUTHORITIES'.\n\nAnswer: AUTHORITIES","Okay, let's analyze the first guess 'AUTHORITIES'.\nThe feedback is:\nA: Yellow (exists, but not position 1)\nU: Gray (does not exist)\nT: Green (position 3 is T)\nH: Gray (does not exist)\nO: Green (position 5 is O)\nR: Yellow (exists, but not position 6)\nI: Yellow (exists, but not position 7)\nT: Yellow (exists, but not position 8)\nI: Green (position 9 is I)\nE: Yellow (exists, but not position 10)\nS: Gray (does not exist)\n\nSo, the secret word is 11 letters long and fits the pattern:\n_ _ T _ O _ _ _ I _ _\n\nIt must contain the letters A, R, I, T, E.\nThe constraints on their positions are:\n- A cannot be at position 1.\n- R cannot be at position 6.\n- I (the first yellow one) cannot be at position 7.\n- T (the yellow one) cannot be at position 8.\n- E cannot be at position 10.\n\nThe letters U, H, S are not in the word.\nThe word contains at least two T's (one at pos 3, one yellow), two I's (one at pos 9, one yellow), one A, one R, one E, and one O (at pos 5).\nTotal known letters: A, E, I, I, O, R, T, T. We need 3 more letters to make 11. These unknown letters cannot be U, H, S.\n\nLet's try to find a word that fits all these conditions. This is quite challenging.\nWe need to place A, R, I, T, E into the pattern `_ _ T _ O _ _ _ I _ _` such that A!=1, R!=6, I!=7, T!=8, E!=10.\n\nLet's try placing the yellow letters.\nMaybe the yellow T is at position 11? `_ _ T _ O _ _ _ I _ T`\nMaybe the yellow I is at position 10? `_ _ T _ O _ _ _ I I T`\nNow place A (not 1), R (not 6), E (not 10).\nMaybe R at 1, A at 2, E at 4? `R A T E O _ _ _ I I T`\nThis uses R, A, T, E, O, I, I, T. These match the required letters.\nThe word looks like `R A T E O _ _ _ I I T`. We need 3 letters for positions 6, 7, 8. They cannot be U, H, S.\nCould the word be related to \"rate\"? Maybe \"RATEABILITY\"? 11 letters.\nR A T E A B I L I T Y\nLet's check:\nPattern: `R A T E A B I L I T Y` matches `_ _ T _ O _ _ _ I _ _`?\nPos 3: T (OK)\nPos 5: A (Fail, must be O)\n\nLet's reconsider the yellow positions.\nHow about \"RETROACTIVE\"? `R E T R O A C T I V E`\nPattern: `_ _ T _ O _ _ _ I _ _`\nPos 3: T (OK)\nPos 5: O (OK)\nPos 9: I (OK)\nLetters: Contains R(2), E(2), T(2), O(1), A(1), I(1).

Correct.\n    *   R is not 6th (it's 1st). Correct.\n    *   I is not 7th (it's 4th and 9th). Correct.\n    *   E is not 10th (it's 11th). Correct.\n    *   T is 3rd, O is 5th, T is 8th, I is 9th.

Combined with the T already green in position 3, this means there are at least two T's.\n*   From Guess 1, we know E is not in position 10. This is consistent with E being green in position 11 (from Guess 2 & 3).\n*   The yellow T in position 8 (from Guess 2 & 3) must go somewhere else. The only available slot that isn't position 8 is position 10.\n*   So the pattern becomes: R A T I O N A _ I T E.\n*   We need to find the letter for position 8. It must be a letter not already excluded (U, H, S, V, Z) and not already placed (R, A, T, I, O, N, A, I, T, E).\n*   Let's consider the word RATIONALITE.\n    *   It matches the pattern R A T I O N A L I T E.\n    *   It uses the letters R, A(x2), T(x2), I(x2), O, N, L, E. The letter L has not been excluded.\n    *   Checking against Guess 2: R(G) A(G) T(G) I(G) O(G) N(G) A(G) T(Y - because L is here, T is elsewhere) I(G) V(Gray) E(G). This matches the feedback.\n    *   Checking against Guess 3: R(G) A(G) T(G) I(G) O(G) N(G) A(G) T(Y - because L is here, T is elsewhere) I(G) Z(Gray) E(G). This matches the feedback.\n    *   Checking against Guess 1: A(Y) U(G) T(G) H(G) O(G) R(Y) I(Y) T(G - *Conflict*) I(G) E(Y) S(G). The feedback for T at position 8 in Guess 1 contradicts the evidence from Guesses 2 and 3 and the proposed solution RATIONALITE (which has L at pos 8). Given the consistency of Guesses 2 and 3, it's likely the feedback for T in Guess 1 was erroneous or misleading.\n\nBased on the evidence from the latest guesses, the word is RATIONALITE.\n\nAnswer: RATIONALITE","Based on the provided Wordle grid:\n\n1.  **Attempt 1: AUTHORITIES**\n    *   A(Yellow), U(Gray), T(Green), H(Gray), O(Green), R(Yellow), I(Green), T(Yellow), I(Green), E(Yellow), S(Gray)\n    *   We know: T is at pos 3, O at pos 5, I at pos 7, I at pos 9.\n    *   A, R, T, E are in the word but in wrong positions shown.\n    *   U, H, S are not in the word.\n\n2.  **Attempt 2: RATIONATIVE**\n    *   R(Green), A(Green), T(Green), I(Green), O(Green), N(Green), A(Green), T(Yellow), I(Green), V(Gray), E(Green)\n    *   Confirmed positions: R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5), N(6), A(7), I(9), E(11).\n    *   There is a second 'T' in the word, but it's not at position 8.\n    *   'V' is not in the word.\n\n3.  **Attempt 3: RATIONALIZE**\n    *   R(Green), A(Green), T(Green), I(Green), O(Green), N(Green), A(Green), L(Green), I(Green), Z(Green), E(Green)\n    *   All letters are green. This indicates that RATIONALIZE is the secret word.

It shows T is in the word but not at position 10.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe third attempt, RATIONALIZE, shows all letters as green. In Wordle, this signifies that the correct word has been guessed. The presence of a fourth attempt contradicts the result shown for the third attempt.

I'll choose a 6-letter word with frequently used vowels and consonants to maximize the chances of getting some yellow or green squares.\n\nA good starting word could be `ORATES`. It uses common letters O, R, A, T, E, S, and all are unique.\n\nAnswer: ORATES","Okay, I can help with that. Let's analyze the first guess and plan the next one.\n\nThe first guess was 'ORATES'.\nThe feedback is:\n- O: Gray (Not in the word)\n- R: Gray (Not in the word)\n- A: Yellow (In the word, but not in position 3)\n- T: Gray (Not in the word)\n- E: Gray (Not in the word)\n- S: Gray (Not in the word)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The secret word is 6 letters long.\n- The word contains the letter 'A'.\n- The letter 'A' is not the third letter.\n- The word does not contain the letters 'O', 'R', 'T', 'E', 'S'.\n\nMy goal for the next guess is to find the position of 'A' and discover other letters in the word. I should use letters that haven't been tried yet, especially common ones. The remaining vowels are I, U, Y. Common consonants not tried yet include N, L, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, Y.\n\nLet's try a word like 'CAULIN'.\n- It is 6 letters long.\n- It contains 'A'.\n- 'A' is in the 2nd position (not the 3rd).\n- It uses 5 new letters: C, U, L, I, N, which are all reasonably common.\n- It avoids the gray letters O, R, T, E, S.\n\nThis guess will test 5 new letters and a potential position for 'A'.\n\nAnswer: CAULIN","Okay, let's analyze the information we have from the first two guesses.\n\n1.  **Guess 1: ORATES**\n    *   O, R, T, E, S are gray (not in the word).\n    *   A is yellow (in the word, but not in position 3).\n2.  **Guess 2: CAULIN**\n    *   C, U, I, N are gray (not in the word).\n    *   A is green (correct letter in the correct position - position 2). This confirms the information from guess 1 (A is not in position 3).\n    *   L is yellow (in the word, but not in position 4).\n\n**Summary:**\n*   The word has 6 letters.\n*   The second letter is A: `_ A _ _ _ _`.\n*   The letter L is in the word, but not in position 4. Since position 2 is A, L must be in position 1, 3, 5, or 6.\n*   Letters confirmed NOT in the word: O, R, T, E, S, C, U, I, N.\n*   Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, and A (only in position 2).\n\n**Strategy for Guess 3:**\nWe need a 6-letter word matching the pattern `_ A _ _ _ _` that includes the letter L (but not in position 4) and only uses the available letters. It's good to prioritize testing common remaining letters like M, P, D, G, B, K, W, Y.\n\nLet's try to construct a word:\n*   We know the structure is `_ A _ _ _ _`.\n*   L must be in position 1, 3, 5, or 6.\n*   We should use letters from the available pool: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nConsider placing L:\n*   If L is 1st: `L A _ _ _ _`. Maybe `LAWMAN`? M is available, N is not. `LAWMAK`? K and M are available. This fits.\n*   If L is 3rd: `_ A L _ _ _`. Maybe `BALKLY`? K and Y are available. B is available. This fits. `PALKMY`? Not a word. `FALXBY`? Not likely. `GALWAY`? W and Y are available. G is available. This fits.\n*   If L is 5th: `_ A _ _ L _`. Maybe `BADLY?`. Need two more letters. `MADLY?`. `MADLYF`? F, M, D, Y are available. This fits.\n*   If L is 6th: `_ A _ _ _ L`. Maybe `JAKHAL`? J, K, H are available. This fits.\n\nWe have several options: `LAWMAK`, `BALKLY`, `GALWAY`, `MADLYF`, `JAKHAL`.\n`MADLYF` tests M, D, Y, F and places L in the 5th spot.\n`GALWAY` tests G, W, Y and places L in the 3rd spot.\n`LAWMAK` tests W, M, K and places L in the 1st spot.\n\nLet's go with `MADLYF`. It uses several common unused consonants (M, D, Y, F) and places L in a new position.\n\nAnswer: MADLYF","Okay, let's analyze the clues from the first three guesses to find the best next guess.\n\n1.  **ORATES**:\n    *   O, R, T, E, S are gray (not in the word).\n    *   A is yellow (in the word, but not in position 3).\n2.  **CAULIN**:\n    *   C, U, I, N are gray (not in the word).\n    *   A is green (in position 2).\n    *   L is yellow (in the word, but not in position 4).\n3.  **MADLYF**:\n    *   M, D, F are gray (not in the word).\n    *   A is green (in position 2, confirms guess 2).\n    *   L is yellow (in the word, but not in position 4, confirms guess 2).\n    *   Y is yellow (in the word, but not in position 5).\n\n**Summary of Information:**\n*   Word length is 6 letters.\n*   The second letter is 'A': `_ A _ _ _ _`\n*   The word contains 'L', but 'L' is not the fourth letter.\n*   The word contains 'Y', but 'Y' is not the fifth letter.\n*   The word does not contain the letters: O, R, T, E, S, C, U, I, N, M, D, F.\n\n**Available Letters:** B, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (plus A, L, Y).\n\n**Constraint Checklist:**\n*   Must be 6 letters.\n*   Must have 'A' in position 2.\n*   Must contain 'L', not in position 4.\n*   Must contain 'Y', not in position 5.\n*   Must only use available letters.\n\n**Finding the Next Guess:**\nWe need a 6-letter word matching `_ A _ _ _ _`, containing L (not 4th) and Y (not 5th), using only the available letters.\n\nLet's try placing L and Y:\n*   L can be in positions 1, 3, 5, 6.\n*   Y can be in positions 1, 3, 4, 6.\n\nConsider common placements. Y often appears at the end. Let's assume Y is the 6th letter: `_ A _ _ _ Y`.\n*   Now L cannot be 4th. L can be 1, 3, 5.\n    *   If L is 5th: `_ A _ _ L Y`. We need letters for positions 1, 3, 4 from B, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. `GABBLY` uses G and B (twice). Let's check:\n        *   G - available\n        *   A - position 2 (correct)\n        *   B - available\n        *   B - available\n        *   L - position 5 (correct, L is present and not 4th)\n        *   Y - position 6 (correct, Y is present and not 5th)\n        *   Uses only allowed letters. This looks like a very strong candidate.\n    *   If L is 3rd: `_ A L _ _ Y`. We need letters for positions 1, 4, 5. `PALKY?` (5 letters) `PALSY?` (S is excluded). `GALL Y?` (double L? Possible but maybe less likely than GABBLY).\n    *   If L is 1st: `L A _ _ _ Y`. We need letters for positions 3, 4, 5. No obvious common words jump out.\n\nGABBLY fits all the constraints perfectly and uses letters (G, B) that haven't been tried yet.\n\nAnswer: GABBLY","Based on the Wordle board provided:\n\n1.  **Guess 1 (ORATES):**\n    *   O, R, T, E, S are gray (not in the word).\n    *   A is yellow (in the word, but not in position 3).\n2.  **Guess 2 (CAULIN):**\n    *   C, U, I, N are gray (not in the word).\n    *   A is green (correctly placed in position 2).\n    *   L is yellow (in the word, but not in position 4).\n3.  **Guess 3 (MADLYF):**\n    *   M, D, F are gray (not in the word).\n    *   A is green (position 2 confirmed).\n    *   L is yellow (in the word, not in position 4).\n    *   Y is yellow (in the word, but not in position 5).\n4.  **Guess 4 (GABBLY):**\n    *   G is green (correctly placed in position 1).\n    *   A is green (position 2 confirmed).\n    *   B is gray (not in the word).\n    *   L is yellow (in the word, not in position 5).\n    *   Y is green (correctly placed in position 6).\n\n**Summary of Clues:**\n*   The word structure is G A _ _ _ Y.\n*   The letter L is in the word.\n*   L is not in position 4 (from CAULIN, MADLYF).\n*   L is not in position 5 (from GABBLY).\n*   Therefore, L must be in position 3.\n*   The word structure is G A L _ _ Y.\n*   Eliminated letters: O, R, T, E, S, C, U, I, N, M, D, F, B.\n*   We need to find letters for positions 4 and 5 from the remaining available letters (A, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z). Note that A, G, L, Y are already used, but letters can repeat.\n\nConsidering the pattern G A L _ _ Y and the available letters, a likely candidate is GALAXY.\n*   G: Position 1 (Green) - Correct.\n*   A: Position 2 (Green) - Correct.\n*   L: Position 3 (Consistent with yellow L not being in 4 or 5) - Correct.\n*   A: Position 4 (A is not eliminated) - Possible.\n*   X: Position 5 (X is not eliminated) - Possible.\n*   Y: Position 6 (Green) - Correct.\n\nGALAXY fits all the constraints and uses the known letters in the correct places.\n\nAnswer: GALAXY"],"have_image":true}

Since this is the first attempt and I have no information from the grid yet, I need to make a starting guess. A good strategy is to choose a word with common and unique letters. I will guess the word 'RAISE'.\n\nAnswer: RAISE","Okay, I can help with this Wordle game!\n\nHere's my analysis based on the first guess \"RAISE\":\n1.  The letters R, A, E are not in the secret word (gray).\n2.  The letter I is in the secret word and in the correct position (green), so the word has the pattern `_ _ I _ _`.\n3.  The letter S is in the secret word but in the wrong position (yellow). It cannot be the 4th letter.\n\nNow, I need to make a second guess. My goal is to use the information gained:\n- The word must have 'I' as the third letter.\n- The word must contain 'S', but not as the fourth letter. So 'S' could be the 1st, 2nd, or 5th letter.\n- The guess must not contain R, A, or E.\n- I should try to use common letters that haven't been tried yet to maximize the information gained.\n\nLet's consider possible words fitting the pattern `_ _ I _ _`, containing 'S' (not 4th), and avoiding R, A, E.\nSome options:\n- Placing 'S' first: `S _ I _ _`. Examples: SLINK, SWING, STINK, SPILT, SHINY, SKILL.\n- Placing 'S' second: `_ S I _ _`. Example: USING.\n- Placing 'S' fifth: `_ _ I _ S`. Examples: CHITS, WHIST, PIOUS, ODIOUS.\n\nA good strategy is to test common unused letters and test 'S' in a potential position. The word \"USING\" fits the criteria:\n- It has 5 letters.\n- The third letter is 'I'.\n- It contains 'S' (in the 2nd position, which is allowed).\n- It does not contain R, A, E.\n- It uses new, common letters: U, N, G.\n\nTherefore, my next guess is USING.\n\nAnswer: USING","Okay, let's analyze the clues:\n\n1.  **Guess 1: RAISE**\n    *   R, A, E are gray (not in the word).\n    *   I is green (correct letter in the 3rd position).\n    *   S is yellow (in the word, but not in the 4th position).\n2.  **Guess 2: USING**\n    *   U is gray (not in the word).\n    *   S is yellow (in the word, but not in the 2nd position).\n    *   I is green (correct letter in the 3rd position).\n    *   N is green (correct letter in the 4th position).\n    *   G is green (correct letter in the 5th position).\n\n**Deductions:**\n*   The word has the structure `_ _ I N G`.\n*   The letters R, A, E, U are not in the word.\n*   The letter S is in the word.\n*   S is not in the 2nd position (from USING).\n*   S is not in the 4th position (from RAISE - although N is green there now, the initial clue still holds).\n*   Positions 3, 4, and 5 are I, N, G respectively.\n*   The only remaining position for S is the 1st position.\n*   So the word structure is `S _ I N G`.\n\nWe need to find the second letter.

It must be in position 1, 2, or 4.\n    *   If 'O' is in position 4: `_ _ _ O S E D`. Possible words using available letters (P, E, D, X etc.):\n        *   `EXPOSED`: E, X, P are available.

It's a common word fitting the profile. If it's correct, we win. If not, the feedback on D (pos 1), E (pos 2), P (pos 3), and O (pos 4) will help narrow down the possibilities between `EXPOSED` and `OPPOSED`. For example, if 'E' at position 2 comes back gray, `OPPOSED` is highly likely. If 'P' at position 3 comes back yellow, `OPPOSED` is the only remaining option.\n\nTherefore, my next guess is `DEPOSED`.\n\nAnswer: DEPOSED","Okay, let's analyze the Wordle board.\n\n1.  **Analyze Guess 1 (TRAINED):**\n    *   T, R, A, I, N are gray, so they are not in the word.\n    *   E is green (position 6), D is green (position 7).

The word structure is _ _ _ _ S E D.\n\n3.  **Analyze Guess 3 (DEPOSED):**\n    *   D is yellow (position 1), so D is in the word but not in the 1st position. We already know D is in position 7. This means there must be *another* D in the word, and it's not in position 1.\n    *   E is yellow (position 2), so E is in the word but not in the 2nd position. We already know E is in position 6. This means there must be *another* E in the word, and it's not in position 2.\n    *   P is green (position 3).\n    *   O is green (position 4). This confirms the position of the yellow O from guess 2.\n    *   S is green (position 5), E is green (position 6), D is green (position 7).\n\n4.  **Combine Information:**\n    *   The word has the structure: _ _ P O S E D.\n    *   We know the letters D and E must be in the first two positions.\n    *   From guess 3, D cannot be in position 1.\n    *   From guess 3, E cannot be in position 2.\n    *   Therefore, E must be in position 1, and D must be in position 2.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The only possible word fitting all the clues is E D P O S E D.\n\nAnswer: EDPOSSED","Based on the Wordle board provided:\n\n1.  **Guess 1: TRAINED**\n    *   T, R, A, I, N are eliminated (gray).\n    *   E is in the 6th position (green).\n    *   D is in the 7th position (green).\n    *   Pattern: `_ _ _ _ _ E D`\n\n2.  **Guess 2: CLOUSED**\n    *   C, L, U are eliminated (gray).\n    *   O is in the word but not in the 3rd position (yellow).\n    *   S is in the 5th position (green).\n    *   E (6th) and D (7th) are confirmed green.\n    *   Pattern: `_ _ O(y) _ S E D`. Eliminated letters: T, R, A, I, N, C, L, U.\n\n3.  **Guess 3: DEPOSED**\n    *   D in the 1st position is yellow (D is in the word, but not here). This is consistent with D being in the 7th position.\n    *   E in the 2nd position is yellow (E is in the word, but not here). This is consistent with E being in the 6th position.\n    *   P is in the 3rd position (green).\n    *   O is in the 4th position (green).\n    *   S is in the 5th position (green).\n    *   E is in the 6th position (green).\n    *   D is in the 7th position (green).\n    *   This confirms the pattern: `_ _ P O S E D`.\n\n**Synthesizing the Clues:**\n\n*   The word has 7 letters and ends in `P O S E D`.\n*   The letters T, R, A, I, N, C, L, U are not in the word.\n*   The word contains P, O, S, E, D in positions 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 respectively.\n*   Guess 3 (DEPOSED) used D in position 1 (yellow) and E in position 2 (yellow). This confirms D is not in position 1 and E is not in position 2.\n\n**Finding the Word:**\n\nWe need to find the first two letters for the pattern `_ _ P O S E D`. The letters must not be any of the eliminated ones (T, R, A, I, N, C, L, U).\nPossible words fitting the pattern `_ _ P O S E D` using the available letters:\n*   **EXPOSED**: E X P O S E D. Uses 'E' (known) and 'X' (not eliminated).\n    *   Check constraints: D is not in 1st (ok, D is 7th). E is not in 2nd (ok, E is 1st and 6th). Fits all clues.\n*   **OPPOSED**: O P P O S E D. Uses 'O' (known) and 'P' (known).\n    *   Check constraints: D is not in 1st (ok, D is 7th). E is not in 2nd (ok, E is 6th). Fits all clues.\n\nBoth EXPOSED and OPPOSED are valid possibilities based on the information. A common strategy is to guess a word that uses new letters to maximize information gain. EXPOSED introduces 'X'. OPPOSED reuses 'O' and 'P'. Therefore, EXPOSED is a reasonable next guess to test the letter 'X' and the position of 'E'.\n\nAnswer: EXPOSED","Based on the clues from the previous four attempts:\n\n1.  **TRAINED**: T, R, A, I, N are not in the word. The word ends in **ED**. ( _ _ _ _ _ E D )\n2.  **CLOUSED**: C, L, U are not in the word. **O** is in the word but not in the 3rd position. **S** is in the 5th position. The word structure is now _ _ O _ S E D, with O not being 3rd. (Gray letters: T, R, A, I, N, C, L, U)\n3.  **DEPOSED**:\n    *   D (1st) is yellow: D is in the word, but not in the 1st position. (We know D is 7th, so this yellow D implies another D exists elsewhere, not in the 1st position).\n    *   E (2nd) is yellow: E is in the word, but not in the 2nd position. (We know E is 6th, so this yellow E implies another E exists elsewhere, not in the 2nd position OR it refers to the E at position 6).\n    *   P (3rd) is green.\n    *   O (4th) is green. (This places the yellow O from guess 2).\n    *   S (5th) is green.\n    *   E (6th) is green.\n    *   D (7th) is green.\n    The word structure is confirmed as **_ _ P O S E D**.\n4.  **EXPOSED**:\n    *   E (1st) is yellow: E is in the word, but not in the 1st position. (Similar logic to guess 3, points to the E at position 6, or potentially another E not at position 1).\n    *   X (2nd) is gray: X is not in the word.\n    *   P O S E D are confirmed green in positions 3-7.\n    (Gray letters: T, R, A, I, N, C, L, U, X)\n\n**Deduction:**\nThe word is **_ _ P O S E D**. We need to find the first two letters.\nThe available letters are B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, Y, Z, and possibly D and E (if they appear more than once).\n\nLet's analyze the yellow letters considering duplicates:\n*   Guess 3 (DEPOSED): D(1) is yellow. Since D(7) is green, this means there must be another D in the word, and it's not in position 1. The only remaining slot is position 2. So, the structure looks like **_ D P O S E D**.\n*   Guess 3 (DEPOSED): E(2) is yellow. Since E(6) is green, this could mean there's another E not in position 2 (i.e., in position 1), OR it could simply mean the guessed E(2) is wrong, but E exists elsewhere (at position 6).\n*   Guess 4 (EXPOSED): E(1) is yellow. Since E(6) is green, this could mean there's another E not in position 1 (i.e., in position 2), OR it could simply mean the guessed E(1) is wrong, but E exists elsewhere (at position 6).\n\nIf we assume there's only one E (at position 6):\n*   E(2) yellow in DEPOSED is consistent (E is in word at pos 6, not pos 2).\n*   E(1) yellow in EXPOSED is consistent (E is in word at pos 6, not pos 1).\n\nIf we assume there are two Ds (at position 2 and 7):\n*   D(1) yellow in DEPOSED is consistent (D is in word at pos 2 & 7, not pos 1).\n\nSo, the structure **_ D P O S E D** seems plausible, with only one E.\nThe first letter cannot be D (from DEPOSED yellow), E (from EXPOSED yellow), or any gray letters (T, R, A, I, N, C, L, U, X), or P, O, S (already placed).\nRemaining options for the first letter: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, Y, Z.\n\nLet's test the word **BEDPOSED**:\n*   Fits pattern **_ D P O S E D**.\n*   Uses allowed letters (B is not grayed out).\n*   Check against Guess 1 (TRAINED): T,R,A,I,N gray, E(6) green, D(7) green. Matches.\n*   Check against Guess 2 (CLOUSED): C,L,U gray, O(3) yellow (O is at 4), S(5) green, E(6) green, D(7) green. Matches.\n*   Check against Guess 3 (DEPOSED): D(1) yellow (D is at 2 & 7), E(2) yellow (E is at 6), P(3) green, O(4) green, S(5) green, E(6) green, D(7) green. Matches.\n*   Check against Guess 4 (EXPOSED): E(1) yellow (E is at 6), X(2) gray, P(3) green, O(4) green, S(5) green, E(6) green, D(7) green. Matches.\n\nThe word BEDPOSED fits all the clues perfectly.\n\nAnswer: BEDPOSED","Based on the rules of Wordle and the clues from the first four attempts:\n\n1.  **Analyze Guess 1 (TRAINED):**\n    *   T, R, A, I, N are gray (not in the word).\n    *   E is green (position 6).\n    *   D is green (position 7).\n    *   Pattern: `_ _ _ _ _ E D`\n\n2.  **Analyze Guess 2 (CLOUSED):**\n    *   C, L, U are gray (not in the word).\n    *   O is yellow (in the word, but not position 3).\n    *   S is green (position 5).\n    *   E is green (position 6).\n    *   D is green (position 7).\n    *   Pattern: `_ _ _ _ S E D`.

E is not at position 2. The green letters confirm P(3), O(4), S(5), E(6), D(7). The yellow D and E simply confirm they are not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.\n\n4.  **Analyze Guess 4 (EXPOSED):**\n    *   E is yellow (in the word, but not position 1).\n    *   X is gray (not in the word).\n    *   P, O, S, E, D are green (positions 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).\n    *   Pattern: `_ _ P O S E D`.\n    *   Constraints: E is not at position 1. X is ruled out.\n    *   Ruled out letters: T, R, A, I, N, C, L, U, X.\n\n5.  **Synthesize Information:**\n    *   The word has the form `_ _ P O S E D`.\n    *   The letters T, R, A, I, N, C, L, U, X are not in the word.\n    *   Position 1 cannot be D or E.\n    *   Position 2 cannot be E.\n    *   We know O is in the word (from yellow O in CLOUSED and green O in DEPOSED\/EXPOSED). It's green at position 4.\n    *   We need to find the first two letters. They cannot be any of the gray letters or D\/E in position 1, or E in position 2.\n    *   Let's consider words matching `_ _ P O S E D` using the remaining letters (B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, V, W, Y, Z, and maybe repeated D, E, O, P, S if allowed).\n    *   Given the structure `_ _ P O S E D`, a likely candidate word is `OPPOSED`.\n    *   Let's check `OPPOSED` against all clues:\n        *   Length 7: Yes.\n        *   Pattern `_ _ P O S E D`: Yes, `O P P O S E D`.\n        *   Gray letters (T, R, A, I, N, C, L, U, X): None are in `OPPOSED`. Correct.\n        *   Green letters (P3, O4, S5, E6, D7): All match `OPPOSED`. Correct.\n        *   Yellow letters:\n            *   CLOUSED: O(3) yellow. `OPPOSED` has O at 1 and 4. O is not at 3.

The goal is to guess the 12-letter secret word in at most 10 attempts. I need to make the first guess.\n\nSince I have no information about the word yet, a good strategy is to guess a word with common and distinct letters to gather as much information as possible. Common letters in English include E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C.\n\nLet's consider some 12-letter words:\n- `RELATIONSHIP` (Uses R, E, L, A, T, I, O, N, S, H, P - 11 unique letters)\n- `CONSIDERABLE` (Uses C, O, N, S, I, D, E, R, A, B, L - 11 unique letters)\n- `PROFESSIONAL` (Uses P, R, O, F, E, S, I, N, A, L - 10 unique letters)\n- `TECHNOLOGIES` (Uses T, E, C, H, N, O, L, G, I, S - 10 unique letters)\n\n`RELATIONSHIP` seems like a strong first choice due to its high number of unique and common letters (including four vowels: A, E, I, O).\n\nMy first guess is `RELATIONSHIP`.\n\nAnswer: RELATIONSHIP","Okay, let's analyze the first guess and the feedback.\nThe guess was RELATIONSHIP.\nThe feedback is:\nR (Yellow), E (Yellow), L (Gray), A (Yellow), T (Yellow), I (Yellow), O (Yellow), N (Gray), S (Yellow), H (Gray), I (Yellow), P (Yellow)\n\nThis means:\n- The secret word is 12 letters long.\n- The letters L, N, H are not in the secret word.\n- The letters R, E, A, T, I, O, S, P are in the secret word.\n- The letter I appears at least twice in the secret word.\n- The positions of the yellow letters are incorrect:\n    - R is not the 1st letter.\n    - E is not the 2nd letter.\n    - A is not the 4th letter.\n    - T is not the 5th letter.\n    - I is not the 6th letter.\n    - O is not the 7th letter.\n    - S is not the 9th letter.\n    - I is not the 11th letter.\n    - P is not the 12th letter.\n\nWe know the word contains the letters: R, E, A, T, I, I, O, S, P (9 letters confirmed).\nThere are 3 unknown letters, which cannot be L, N, or H.\n\nI need to make a second guess, which must be a 12-letter word, using the known letters in different positions and avoiding the excluded letters.\n\nLet's try to construct a word that fits these criteria. We need to rearrange R, E, A, T, I, I, O, S, P and find 3 additional letters (not L, N, H).\n\nConsider the known letters and constraints. A good strategy is to try placing the yellow letters in new valid positions and potentially introduce common letters as the unknowns.\n\nLet's try the word 'PICTORIATEST'.\nIt is a 12-letter word.\nLetters are: P, I, C, T, O, R, I, A, T, E, S, T.\nIt contains the known yellow letters: P, I (x2), T, O, R, A, E, S. All 9 known letters are present except that it uses T three times, while we only know T is present at least once. It introduces one new letter 'C'.\nExcluded letters L, N, H are not used.\n\nLet's check the positional constraints for 'PICTORIATEST':\nP(1): R is not 1st. OK.\nI(2): E is not 2nd. OK.\nC(3): Position OK.\nT(4): A is not 4th. OK.\nO(5): T is not 5th. OK.\nR(6): I is not 6th. OK.\nI(7): O is not 7th. OK.\nA(8): Position OK.\nT(9): S is not 9th. OK.\nE(10): Position OK.\nS(11): I is not 11th. OK.\nT(12): P is not 12th. OK.\n\nThe word PICTORIATEST satisfies all the constraints derived from the first guess and uses most of the known letters while introducing a new common letter 'C'. It seems like a plausible and informative guess.\n\nAnswer: PICTORIATEST","Okay, let's break down the clues from the Wordle board.\n\n1.  **Analyze Guess 1: RELATIONSHIP**\n    *   R(Yellow), E(Yellow), L(Gray), A(Yellow), T(Yellow), I(Yellow), O(Gray), N(Gray), S(Yellow), H(Yellow), I(Yellow), P(Yellow)\n    *   Letters NOT in the word: L, O, N.\n    *   Letters IN the word: R, E, A, T, I, S, H, P.

Although it seems unusual, it is the logical deduction from the Wordle clues provided.\n\nAnswer: PHIISRTATTES","Okay, let's break down the Wordle puzzle.\n\n1.  **Analyze Previous Guesses:**\n    *   Guess 1: `RELATIONSHIP`\n        *   Gray: L, O, N, H\n        *   Yellow: R (not 1), E (not 2), A (not 4), T (not 5), I (not 7), S (not 9), I (not 11), P (not 12)\n    *   Guess 2: `PICTORIATEST`\n        *   Green: P (1), R (6), A (9), T (10)\n        *   Gray: C, O\n        *   Yellow: I (not 2), T (not 4), I (not 8), E (not 11), S (not 12), T (not 12 - This T is the 3rd T in the word)\n    *   Guess 3: `PHISRTATTES` (Corrected based on image)\n        *   Green: P (1), R (6), A (9), T (10)\n        *   Gray: H\n        *   Yellow: I (not 3), I (not 4), S (not 5), T (not 7), T (not 11), E (not 12), S (not 12 - This S is the 2nd S)\n\n2.  **Consolidate Information:**\n    *   Word Length: 12\n    *   Excluded Letters: L, O, N, H, C\n    *   Known Green Letters: P (1), R (6), A (9), T (10)\n    *   Pattern: `P _ _ _ _ R _ _ A T _ _`\n    *   Known Yellow Letters (must be in the word): E, T, T, I, I, S, S\n    *   Total known letters: P, R, A, T, T, T, I, I, S, S, E (11 letters). There is one unknown letter, let's call it '?'.\n    *   The 12 letters in the word are P, R, A, T, T, T, I, I, S, S, E, ?.\n\n3.  **Refine Letter Positions:**\n    *   P: 1 (Green)\n    *   R: 6 (Green)\n    *   A: 9 (Green)\n    *   T: 10 (Green). Other two Ts: Not 4, 5, 7, 11, 12. Possible positions for the two yellow Ts: {2, 3, 8}.\n    *   I: Two Is. Not 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 11. Possible positions for I: {5, 12}. So, I is at 5 and 12.\n    *   S: Two Ss. Not 5, 9, 12. Possible positions for S: {2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 11}.\n    *   E: One E. Not 2, 11, 12. Possible positions for E: {3, 4, 7, 8}. (Note: I is at 5).\n    *   ?: One unknown letter. Cannot be L, O, N, H, C. It also cannot be P, R, A (already green). It's unlikely to be T, I, S, E based on yellow positions, unless the word has more copies than detected. So ? is likely one of {B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z}. Possible positions for ?: {2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 11}.\n\n4.  **Update Pattern:** With I at 5 and 12:\n    `P _ _ _ I R _ _ A T _ I`\n    Remaining positions to fill: 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 11\n    Remaining letters to place: T, T, E, S, S, ?\n\n5.  **Deduce Placement:**\n    *   As shown in the thought process, placing S at position 11 leads to contradictions regarding the number of S's required. Therefore, S cannot be at position 11.\n    *   Since E and T are also excluded from position 11, position 11 MUST be the unknown letter '?'.\n    *   Pattern: `P _ _ _ I R _ _ A T ? I`\n    *   Remaining positions to fill: 2, 3, 4, 7, 8\n    *   Remaining letters to place: T, T, E, S, S\n\n6.  **Analyze Cases based on T placement ({2,3,8}):**\n    *   Case 1: T at 2, 3 -> `P T T _ I R _ _ A T ? I`. Fill 4, 7, 8 with E, S, S. Valid structures: `P T T E I R S S A T ? I`, `P T T S I R E S A T ? I`, `P T T S I R S E A T ? I`.\n    *   Case 2: T at 2, 8 -> `P T _ _ I R _ T A T ? I`. Fill 3, 4, 7 with E, S, S. Valid structures: `P T E S I R S T A T ? I`, `P T S E I R S T A T ? I`, `P T S S I R E T A T ? I`.\n    *   Case 3: T at 3, 8 -> `P _ T _ I R _ T A T ? I`. Fill 2, 4, 7 with E, S, S. (E cannot be 2, so S must be 2). `P S T _ I R _ T A T ? I`. Fill 4, 7 with E, S. Valid structures: `P S T E I R S T A T ? I`, `P S T S I R E T A T ? I`.\n\n7.  **Evaluate Structures:** We have 8 possible structures. Let's re-examine 3a and 3b as they seem highly constrained:\n    *   3a: `P S T E I R S T A T ? I`\n    *   3b: `P S T S I R E T A T ? I`\n    Neither forms an obvious common English word with usual letters substituted for '?'. However, they fit all constraints. Let's try structure 3a (`P S T E I R S T A T ? I`) and guess a plausible letter for '?'. Given the somewhat technical feel of previous guesses, 'V' might be a possibility.\n\n8.  **Proposed Guess:** Based on structure 3a and choosing V for the unknown letter: `PSTEIRSTATVI`\n    *   Letters: P(1) S(2) T(3) E(1) I(2) R(1) A(1) V(1). Matches required letters P R A T T T I I S S E with ?=V.\n    *   Positions check out against constraints.\n\nAlthough \"PSTEIRSTATVI\" is not a standard English word, it is the result of rigorous deduction based on the provided clues. It fits the pattern, uses the correct letters, and respects all position constraints.\n\nAnswer: PSTEIRSTATVI","Okay, let's analyze the Wordle state based on the provided image and rules.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Guesses:**\n    *   Guess 1: RELATIONSHIP (R E A T I S P are yellow, L O N H are gray)\n    *   Guess 2: PICTORIATEST (P1 G, R6 G, A8 G, T9 G. I T I E S T are yellow, C O gray)\n    *   Guess 3: P H I I S R T A T T E S (P1 G, R6 G, T7 G, A8 G, T9 G. I I S T E S are yellow, H gray)\n    *   Guess 4: P S T E I R S T A T V I (P1 G, R6 G, T10 G, V11 G, I12 G. S T E I S T A are yellow)\n\n2.  **Contradiction Check:** There's a contradiction between Guess 3 and Guess 4. Guess 3 indicates T7, A8, T9 are Green. Guess 4 shows S7, T8, A9 as Yellow for the same positions. In Wordle, later guesses often reflect the most accurate information or correct previous assumptions. We will proceed assuming Guess 4 provides the current correct state.\n\n3.  **Information from Guess 4:**\n    *   Green Letters (Correct Position): P (1), R (6), T (10), V (11), I (12)\n    *   Yellow Letters (Correct Letter, Wrong Position): S (2), T (3), E (4), I (5), S (7), T (8), A (9)\n    *   Gray Letters (Not in Word - from all guesses): L, O, N, H, C\n\n4.  **Deduced Information:**\n    *   Secret Word Structure: P _ _ _ _ R _ _ _ T V I\n    *   Letters in the Word: From the green and yellow letters in Guess 4, we know the word contains: P(1), R(1), T(1+2=3), V(1), I(1+1=2), S(2), E(1), A(1). Total = 1+1+3+1+2+2+1+1 = 12 letters.\n    *   Letters to Place: We need to place the yellow letters (A, E, I, S, S, T, T) into the blank positions (2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9). Note: one I is already green at position 12, so the yellow I goes into one of the blanks.\n    *   Placement Constraints (Yellow letters cannot be in the guessed position):\n        *   S cannot be in position 2 or 7.\n        *   T cannot be in position 3 or 8.\n        *   E cannot be in position 4.\n        *   I cannot be in position 5.\n        *   A cannot be in position 9.\n\n5.  **Finding the Word:** We need to arrange A, E, I, S, S, T, T into positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, respecting the constraints.\n    *   Available positions for each letter:\n        *   A: {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8}\n        *   E: {2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9}\n        *   I: {2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}\n        *   S (x2): {3, 4, 5, 8, 9}\n        *   T (x2): {2, 4, 5, 7, 9}\n\n    *   Let's try placing T S T in positions 7, 8, 9.\n        *   T(7): OK (Cannot be 3, 8)\n        *   S(8): OK (Cannot be 2, 7)\n        *   T(9): OK (Cannot be 3, 8; Cannot be A)\n    *   If the sequence is T S T for 7, 8, 9: P _ _ _ _ R T S T T V I.\n    *   Letters left to place: A, E, I, S.\n    *   Positions left: 2, 3, 4, 5.\n    *   Constraints for these positions: S!=2, T!=3, E!=4, I!=5.\n    *   Place A, E, I, S in 2, 3, 4, 5.\n        *   S must be in {3, 4, 5}.\n        *   T is not left.\n        *   E must be in {2, 3, 5}.\n        *   I must be in {2, 3, 4}.\n        *   A must be in {2, 3, 4, 5}.\n    *   Try S=3: P _ S _ _ R T S T T V I. Left: A, E, I. Pos: 2, 4, 5. Constraints: E!=4, I!=5.\n        *   E must be in {2, 5}.\n        *   I must be in {2, 4}.\n        *   A must be in {2, 4, 5}.\n        *   Option 1: E=2, I=4, A=5 => P E S I A R T S T T V I\n        *   Option 2: E=5, I=2, A=4 => P I S A E R T S T T V I\n        *   Option 3: E=5, I=4, A=2 => P A S I E R T S T T V I\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Following the constraints strictly derived from Guess 4 leads to potential arrangements like PESIARTSTTVI, PISAERTSTTVI, or PASIERTSTTVI. None of these are standard English words. However, PASIERTSTTVI fits all constraints perfectly:\n    *   P(G) A(Y-9 -> 2 OK) S(Y-2 -> 3 OK) I(Y-5 -> 4 OK) E(Y-4 -> 5 OK) R(G) T(Y-3 -> 7 OK) S(Y-7 -> 8 OK) T(Y-8 -> 9 OK) T(G) V(G) I(G).\n    *   Uses P(1), A(1), S(2), I(2), E(1), R(1), T(3), V(1). Correct letters.\n\nGiven that Wordle answers are typically real words, there might be an issue with the provided game state (perhaps the contradiction indicates an error). However, based purely on applying the rules to the final guess provided (Guess 4), the mathematically derived sequence is PASIERTSTTVI. Since a real word is expected, let's reconsider if any arrangement forms a known word. No common English word seems to fit the pattern and letter constraints perfectly. Trusting the process derived from the last guess:\n\nAnswer: PASIERTSTTVI","Okay, let's break down the clues from the Wordle grid.\n\n1.  **Analyze Guesses and Colors:**\n    *   **Guess 1: RELATIONSHIP** (R Y, E Y, L X, A Y, T Y, I Y, O X, N X, S Y, H X, I Y, P X)\n        *   Letters Absent: L, O, N, H, P\n    *   **Guess 2: PICTORIATEST** (P G, I Y, C X, T Y, O X, R G, I Y, A Y, T G, E Y, S Y, T Y)\n        *   Letters Absent: C, O (already known)\n        *   Known Positions: P(1), R(6), T(9)\n        *   Letters Present: P, I, T, R, A, E, S\n    *   **Guess 3: PHIISRTATTES** (P G, H X, I Y, I Y, S Y, R G, T Y, A Y, T G, T Y, E Y, S Y)\n        *   Letters Absent: H (already known)\n        *   Known Positions: P(1), R(6), T(9) (consistent)\n        *   Confirms multiple I's, S's, T's are present.\n    *   **Guess 4: PSTEIRSTATVI** (P G, S Y, T Y, E Y, I Y, R G, R Y, S Y, T G, A Y, V G, I Y)\n        *   Known Positions: P(1), R(6), T(9), V(11)\n        *   The yellow R at pos 7 suggests a second R exists, but not at pos 7.\n        *   Confirms V is present.

This seems contradictory to needing two T's. Let's re-evaluate the G4 yellow R(7). If R(6) is green, a yellow R(7) implies a second R exists but not at pos 7. If we assume this clue is correct:\n        *   Letters: P, E, R, R, T, T, V, A, S, S, I, I (2 T's, 2 R's).\n        *   Letters to place: A, S, S, I, I, T, R into slots 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 12.\n        *   I -> 8, 10.

This strongly points to only one E.\n    *   Let's trust the analysis that P T A S E R S I T I V E was the best fit for G2, G3, G5, and only conflicted with G4 on the R(7) color.\n\n4.  **Final Check:**\n    *   Word: P T A S E R S I T I V E\n    *   Letters: P(1), T(2), A(1), S(2), E(2), R(1), I(2), V(1).

Checking these candidates, none appear to be common English words. However, given the constraints, one must be correct according to the game's dictionary. Let's re-examine the most likely structures. `P A S T E R I I T S V E` has a double 'I' which is consistent with having one green 'I' and one yellow 'I'.\n\nLet's select `P A S T E R I I T S V E` as the most plausible guess based on the derived possibilities.\n\nAnswer: PASTERIITSVE","Okay, let's analyze the Wordle state based on the provided image and rules.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Rules & Current State:**\n    *   Word Length: 12 letters.\n    *   Max Attempts: 10.\n    *   Current Attempts: 7.\n    *   Remaining Attempts: 3.\n    *   The goal is to find the secret word based on the feedback from the 7 guesses.\n\n2.  **Analyze Guess 7 (Latest Guess):**\n    *   Guess: P A S T E R I T S I V E (based on image colors, OCR might be slightly off)\n    *   Feedback:\n        *   Green (Correct Letter, Correct Position): P (1), E (5), R (6), V (11), E (12)\n        *   Yellow (Correct Letter, Wrong Position): A (2), S (3), T (4), I (7), T (8), S (9), I (10)\n        *   Gray (Letter not in word - from previous guesses): L, N, C, H\n\n3.  **Synthesize Information:**\n    *   The secret word has the structure: `P _ _ _ E R _ _ _ _ V E`\n    *   The 7 blank positions (2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10) must be filled with the yellow letters.\n    *   Yellow letters to place: A (1), S (2), T (2), I (2).\n    *   Positional Constraints (from Guess 7 yellows):\n        *   A is not in position 2.\n        *   S is not in position 3 or 9.\n        *   T is not in position 4 or 8.\n        *   I is not in position 7 or 10.\n\n4.  **Deduce the Word:**\n    *   We need to arrange A, S, S, T, T, I, I into slots 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 respecting the constraints.\n    *   Let's try to systematically place the letters.

This accounts for all 12 letters.\n\n3.  **Place Yellow Letters:** We need to place {A, T, T, I, E} into positions {2, 3, 7, 8, 12} respecting the yellow constraints:\n    *   A cannot be in position 2.\n    *   T cannot be in position 3 or 7.\n    *   I cannot be in position 8.\n    *   E cannot be in position 12.\n\n4.  **Deduce Placement:**\n    *   Consider the two T's.

However, they are the mathematically valid solutions based on the provided grid. Given the structure P _ _ S E R _ _ S V E _, words related to \"assertive\", \"preservative\", etc., might come to mind, but they don't fit the specific green\/yellow pattern. `PEASERITSVET` seems slightly more plausible structurally than the others, potentially relating to assertion or perseverance in an obscure way. Lacking a clear common word, I will choose this one as it fits all clues.\n\nAnswer: PEASERITSVET","Okay, let's analyze the Wordle board. We have 9 attempts used out of 10, so this is the last guess. The word length is 12.\n\nHere's a summary of the information gathered:\n1.  **Gray Letters (Excluded):** L, O, N, H, C\n2.  **Known Letters & Positions (Greens):** This is tricky due to inconsistencies between guesses.\n    *   G7: E(5), R(6), I(7), V(11), E(12)\n    *   G8: P(1), E(5), R(6), T(7), V(11), E(12)\n    *   G9: P(1), E(5), R(6), T(7), S(9), V(11)\n    The most consistent greens appearing late are P(1), E(5), R(6), V(11). Position 7 (I\/T), Position 9 (T\/S), and Position 12 (T\/E) are points of conflict.\n3.  **Known Letters (Yellows):** Accumulating yellows and considering greens, the letter pool seems to be: **P, A, S, S, T, T, I, E, E, E, R, V**. (1 P, 1 A, 2 S, 2 T, 1 I, 3 E, 1 R, 1 V = 12 letters). Gray letters L, O, N, H, C are confirmed absent.\n\nLet's try working with the latest green information from Guess 9, as it's the most recent attempt:\n**Green:** P(1), E(5), R(6), T(7), S(9), V(11).\n**Structure:** P _ _ _ E R T _ S _ V _\n\nThe letters needed to fill the blanks (positions 2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 12) are the remaining ones from the pool: **A, S, T, I, E, E**.\n\nNow let's apply constraints from the yellow clues, mainly focusing on the *positions* where letters were yellow in the last guess (G9: PEASERTISVET -> yellows E2, A3, S4, I8, E11, T12, acknowledging the E11\/T12 conflict):\n*   E cannot be in position 2 (or 11).\n*   A cannot be in position 3.\n*   S cannot be in position 4 (or 9, which is green).\n*   I cannot be in position 8.\n*   T cannot be in position 12.\n\nCombining these constraints for the letters A, S, T, I, E, E in positions 2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 12:\n*   A: Must be in {2, 4, 8, 10, 12} (not 3)\n*   S: Must be in {2, 3, 8, 10, 12} (not 4)\n*   T: Must be in {2, 3, 4, 8, 10} (not 12)\n*   I: Must be in {2, 3, 4, 10, 12} (not 8)\n*   E1: Must be in {3, 4, 8, 10, 12} (not 2)\n*   E2: Must be in {3, 4, 8, 10, 12} (not 2)\n\nLet's try to construct the word: P _ _ _ E R T _ S _ V _\nTry placing T (cannot be 12): T must be in {2, 3, 4, 8, 10}.\nTry placing S (cannot be 4): S must be in {2, 3, 8, 10, 12}.\nTry placing A (cannot be 3): A must be in {2, 4, 8, 10, 12}.\nTry placing I (cannot be 8): I must be in {2, 3, 4, 10, 12}.\nTry placing Es (cannot be 2): Es must be in {3, 4, 8, 10, 12}.\n\nLet's try the combination derived earlier which satisfied G9 green\/yellow position constraints: `PSEAERTESTVI`.\nLetters: P S E A E R T E S T V I. Uses P, S(2), E(3), A, R, T(2), V, I. Matches the pool.\nStructure: P(1) S(2) E(3) A(4) E(5) R(6) T(7) E(8) S(9) T(10) V(11) I(12).\nCheck Greens: P(1)G, E(5)G, R(6)G, T(7)G, S(9)G, V(11)G. OK.\nCheck Yellow Constraints (G9):\n*   E(3, 8): OK (not 2).\n*   A(4): OK (not 3).\n*   S(2): OK (not 4).\n*   I(12): OK (not 8).\n*   T(10): OK (not 12).\nThis word fits the constraints derived from Guess 9 greens and yellow positions, and uses the correct letters. Although \"PSEAERTESTVI\" is not a standard English word, given the potential inconsistencies in the previous guesses, it's a logically derived answer based on the last guess.\n\nLet's re-evaluate P S E A E R T S T I V E (derived from G8 greens + I(10) green).\nLetters: P S E A E R T S T I V E. Uses P, A, S(2), T(2), I, E(3), R, V. Matches pool.\nStructure: P(1) S(2) E(3) A(4) E(5) R(6) T(7) S(8) T(9) I(10) V(11) E(12).\nCheck G9 Greens: P(1)G, E(5)G, R(6)G, T(7)G, S(9)G? No, S is 8, T is 9. V(11)G. Conflicts with G9 green S(9).\n\nLet's re-evaluate P S E A E R I S T T V E (derived from G7 greens).\nLetters: P S E A E R I S T T V E. Uses P A S(2) T(2) I E(3) R V. Matches pool.\nStructure: P(1) S(2) E(3) A(4) E(5) R(6) I(7) S(8) T(9) T(10) V(11) E(12).\nCheck G9 Greens: P(1)G, E(5)G, R(6)G, T(7)G? No, I is 7. S(9)G? No, T is 9. V(11)G. Conflicts with G9 greens T(7) and S(9).\n\nGiven the conflicts, the word derived from G9 greens and yellow constraints `PSEAERTESTVI` appears to be the most directly supported by the final guess state, despite its unusual form.\n\nFinal check: PSEAERTESTVI\nP(G) S(y) E(y) A(y) E(G) R(G) T(G) E(y) S(G) T(y) V(G) I(y)\nDoes this match G9: PEASERTISVET -> P(G) E(y) A(y) S(y) E(G) R(G) T(G) I(y) S(G) V(G) E(y) T(y)?\nIt aligns well positionally, but the letters placed differ from the guess itself (e.g., S in pos 2 vs E in guess 9). This is expected as the guess was incorrect. It fulfils the green requirements P_ _ _ERTS_V_ and uses the required letters A,S,T,I,E,E in other slots respecting yellow position constraints from G9.\n\nAnswer: PSEAERTESTVI"],"have_image":true}

We need to place the letters A, A, C, C, E, R, T, X (and possibly one repeat) into the blanks: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12.\n\nConsider the word `RACETRAERICX`:\nR(1) A(2) C(3) E(4) T(5) R(6) A(7) E(8) R(9) I(10) C(11) X(12)\n\nLet's check this against our constraints:\n*   Pattern: `.......ERI..` - Matches E(8), R(9), I(10).\n*   Letters: Contains A(2), C(2), E(2), R(3), T(1), X(1), I(1). This assumes R appears 3 times.\n*   Gray Letters: Does not contain M, B, D, O, U, S, H, Z. OK.\n*   Constraints:\n    *   A not 1, 3, 5. (Positions 2, 7 are OK).\n    *   C not 1, 6. (Positions 3, 11 are OK).\n    *   E not 6, 12. (Position 4 is OK for the second E).\n    *   R not 4. (Positions 1, 6 are OK for the other two R's).\n    *   T not 7, 8. (Position 5 is OK).\n    *   X not 7. (Position 12 is OK).\n    *   I not 4. (Position 10 is OK).\n\n`RACETRAERICX` fits all derived constraints and uses a plausible letter frequency (R appearing 3 times). While it might not be a common English word, it's a valid candidate based on the Wordle rules and feedback.\n\nAnswer: RACETRAERICX","Okay, let's break down the clues to find the secret 12-letter word.\n\n**1.

If RACCETEERIRA were the word, R(11) in that guess should have been Green. This suggests the R(11) Yellow hint in G5\/7 might be the source of the contradiction.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Given the contradiction, the most plausible word fitting the majority of clues, assuming the R(11) Yellow in guess 5\/7 is incorrect, is RACCETEERIRA.\n\nAnswer: RACCETEERIRA","Based on the analysis of the provided Wordle grid:\n\n1.  **Word Length:** 12 letters.\n2.  **Attempts Used:** 8 out of 10.\n3.  **Known Green Letters & Positions:** R(1), A(2), C(3), E(5), T(6), E(7), E(8), R(9), I(10). The pattern is `R A C _ E T E E R I _ _`.\n4.  **Letters to Place:** From the yellow letters in the most recent guesses (especially Guess 8: `RACACETEERIRA` which had yellow C at 4, R at 11, A at 12), the remaining letters for positions 4, 11, and 12 must be C, R, and A.\n5.  **Letter Count Check:** The confirmed letters are R(2 green + 1 yellow = 3), A(1 green + 1 yellow = 2), C(1 green + 1 yellow = 2), E(3 green), T(1 green), I(1 green). Total = 3+2+2+3+1+1 = 12 letters. This matches the word length.\n6.  **Positional Constraints from Yellows:**\n    *   Position 4: Cannot be C (Guess 8), A (Guess 5\/7), R (Guess 6), T (Guess 4), E (Guess 3).\n    *   Position 11: Cannot be R (Guess 8, 5\/7), A (Guess 6), E (Guess 4), C (Guess 3).\n    *   Position 12: Cannot be A (Guess 8), C (Guess 5\/7, 6, 4), E (Guess 2).\n7.  **Contradiction:** The constraints indicate that position 4 cannot be C, A, or R. However, these are the only letters left to place in the remaining slots (4, 11, 12). Similarly, position 11 cannot be R, A, or C. This means there is no valid solution that satisfies all the color hints provided in the image according to standard Wordle rules. This suggests a potential error in the grid image's colors.\n8.  **Best Guess Strategy:** Assuming there must be a solution and potentially an error in the displayed hints (most likely an incorrect yellow), we need to find the most plausible arrangement. Let's test the permutation `RACAETEERICR`.\n    *   This places A in 4, C in 11, R in 12.\n    *   Checking against constraints:\n        *   A in 4 violates the yellow A seen in position 4 in Guess 5\/7.\n        *   C in 11 violates the yellow C seen in position 11 in Guess 3.\n        *   R in 12 is consistent with constraints for position 12.\n    *   This word is consistent with the green letters and the yellow letters from the most recent guess (Guess 8), assuming the letters C, R, A must be placed. It violates constraints from older guesses (G3 and G5\/7). Given the contradiction, this seems like a reasonable guess, assuming one or more older yellow hints were inaccurate.\n\nAnswer: RACAETEERICR","Based on the Wordle grid provided:\n\n1.  **Analyze the latest guess (Row 9):**\n    *   Guess: `R A C A E T E E R I C R`\n    *   Green letters (correct position): R(1), A(2), C(3), E(5), T(6), E(7), E(8), R(9), I(10)\n    *   Yellow letters (correct letter, wrong position): A(4), C(11), R(12)\n    *   Current known pattern: `R A C _ E T E E R I _ _`\n    *   The letters for positions 4, 11, and 12 must be A, C, and R.\n    *   Constraints from yellow: A cannot be in position 4, C cannot be in position 11, R cannot be in position 12.\n\n2.  **Determine possible words based on Row 9:**\n    *   We need to place A, C, R into positions 4, 11, 12 respecting the constraints.\n    *   Case 1: Place C in position 4 (A!=4, C!=11, R!=12). Remaining letters A, R for positions 11, 12. R cannot be 12, so R must be 11 and A must be 12. Word: `R A C C E T E E R I R A`\n    *   Case 2: Place R in position 4 (A!=4, C!=11, R!=12). Remaining letters A, C for positions 11, 12. C cannot be 11, so C must be 12 and A must be 11. Word: `R A C R E T E E R I A C`\n\n3.  **Consider previous guesses (Potential Inconsistencies):**\n    *   Row 6 guessed `R A C R E T E E R I A C` and received feedback indicating A(11) was yellow (implying the word is *not* `R A C R E T E E R I A C` if the feedback was correct).\n    *   Row 8 guessed `R A C C E T E E R I R A` and received feedback indicating A(12) was yellow (implying the word is *not* `R A C C E T E E R I R A` if the feedback was correct).\n    *   There appears to be a contradiction in the game state presented across different rows. The feedback seems inconsistent if assuming a single target word throughout.\n\n4.  **Choose the best guess for the final attempt:**\n    *   Given the inconsistencies, the safest strategy is to rely solely on the information from the *most recent* guess (Row 9).\n    *   This leaves two possibilities: `R A C C E T E E R I R A` and `R A C R E T E E R I A C`.\n    *   Both fit the constraints derived strictly from Row 9.\n    *   Row 8's guess (`R A C C E T E E R I R A`) resulted in 11 green letters and only one yellow (A at pos 12). This is very close, suggesting this might be the word and the single yellow feedback was an error or glitch.\n    *   Let's choose the word suggested by the nearly correct Row 8 guess, which also fits the Row 9 constraints.\n\nMy final guess is `RACCETEERIRA`.\n\nAnswer: RACCETEERIRA"],"have_image":true}

The grid is currently empty.\n\nFor my first guess, I want a word with common letters and preferably no repeated letters to maximize the information I get. A good strategy is to include several vowels and common consonants.\n\nConsidering common 9-letter words with unique, frequent letters:\n- 'EDUCATION' (covers all vowels)\n- 'CREATIONS' (A, E, I, O and C, R, T, N, S)\n- 'ORIENTALS' (O, R, I, E, N, T, A, L, S)\n- 'HEARTINGS' (H, E, A, R, T, I, N, G, S)\n- 'OPERATING' (O, P, E, R, A, T, I, N, G)\n\n'CREATIONS' seems like a very strong starting word because it uses the vowels A, E, I, O and the highly frequent consonants C, R, T, N, S, with no repeated letters.\n\nMy first guess is CREATIONS.\n\nAnswer: CREATIONS","Okay, let's analyze the feedback from the first guess, CREATIONS:\n- Length: 9 letters\n- Attempt 1: CREATIONS\n- Feedback:\n    - C: Yellow (exists, not in position 1)\n    - R: Gray (does not exist)\n    - E: Gray (does not exist)\n    - A: Yellow (exists, not in position 4)\n    - T: Yellow (exists, not in position 5)\n    - I: Yellow (exists, not in position 6)\n    - O: Yellow (exists, not in position 7)\n    - N: Yellow (exists, not in position 8)\n    - S: Gray (does not exist)\n\nWe know:\n- The word is 9 letters long.\n- It contains the letters C, A, T, I, O, N.\n- It does *not* contain the letters R, E, S.\n- The positions of C, A, T, I, O, N are not the ones they occupied in \"CREATIONS\".\n\nMy goal for the second guess is to:\n1.  Use all the known yellow letters (C, A, T, I, O, N) in different positions.\n2.  Avoid the gray letters (R, E, S).\n3.  Introduce new common letters to gain more information about the remaining unknown letters.\n\nLet's try to construct a word. We need to place C, A, T, I, O, N in new spots and add 3 other letters (not R, E, S). Good letters to test are L, D, H, P, U, G, M, Y.\n\nConsider the structure. Many 9-letter words end in -ION or -ATION, but we know A, T, I, O, N are not in positions 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\n\nLet's try placing the known letters: C, A, T, I, O, N.\nMaybe try a word like \"DICTIONAL\":\n- D (new)\n- I (known, not in pos 6)\n- C (known, not in pos 1)\n- T (known, not in pos 5)\n- I (known, tests duplicate I, not in pos 6)\n- O (known, not in pos 7)\n- N (known, not in pos 8)\n- A (known, not in pos 4)\n- L (new)\n\nLet's check \"DICTIONAL\":\n- 9 letters long: Yes.\n- Contains C, A, T, I, O, N: Yes.\n- Avoids R, E, S: Yes.\n- Places C, A, T, I, O, N in new positions: Yes (I is in 2 & 5, C in 3, T in 4, O in 6, N in 7, A in 8).\n- Introduces new letters: Yes, D and L.\n- Tests a potential duplicate: Yes, the letter I.\n\nThis seems like a good strategic guess. It utilizes all current information and seeks new information efficiently.\n\nAnswer: DICTIONAL","Based on the clues from the first two guesses, let's analyze the information we have:\n\n1.  **Guess 1: CREATIONS**\n    *   Yellow letters (in the word, wrong position): C, A, T, I, O, N\n    *   Gray letters (not in the word): R, E, S\n2.  **Guess 2: DICTIONAL**\n    *   Yellow letters (in the word, wrong position): D, I, C, T, I, O, N, A\n    *   Gray letters (not in the word): L\n\n**Consolidated Information:**\n*   **Letters in the word:** A, C, D, I, N, O, T. Since 'I' appeared yellow twice in the second guess (\"DICTIONAL\"), we know there are at least two 'I's in the word. So the confirmed letters are {A, C, D, I, I, N, O, T}. This accounts for 8 letters.\n*   **Letters NOT in the word:** R, E, S, L.\n*   **Word Length:** 9 letters.\n*   Since we have identified 8 letters (A, C, D, I, I, N, O, T) and the word length is 9, the 9th letter must be a repeat of one of the letters A, C, D, I, N, O, T.\n\n**Positional Constraints (letter is NOT at this position):**\n*   From CREATIONS: C!=1, A!=4, T!=5, I!=6, O!=7, N!=8\n*   From DICTIONAL: D!=1, I!=2, C!=3, T!=4, I!=5, O!=6, N!=7, A!=8\n\n**Combined Positional Constraints:**\n*   A: Not 4, Not 8\n*   C: Not 1, Not 3\n*   D: Not 1\n*   I: Not 2, Not 5, Not 6\n*   N: Not 7, Not 8\n*   O: Not 6, Not 7\n*   T: Not 4, Not 5\n\nNow let's find a 9-letter word using the letters {A, C, D, I, I, N, O, T} + one repeat from {A, C, D, I, N, O, T}, that satisfies all positional constraints and does not contain R, E, S, L.\n\nConsider the word **ADDICTION**:\n*   Letters: A, D, D, I, C, T, I, O, N. This set is {A, C, D(2), I(2), N, O, T}. It uses the required letters and repeats 'D'. Total 9 letters.\n*   It does not contain R, E, S, L.\n*   Let's check positional constraints against ADDICTION (A1 D2 D3 I4 C5 T6 I7 O8 N9):\n    *   A @ pos 1: OK (Not 4, Not 8)\n    *   C @ pos 5: OK (Not 1, Not 3)\n    *   D @ pos 2, 3: OK (Not 1)\n    *   I @ pos 4, 7: OK (Not 2, Not 5, Not 6)\n    *   N @ pos 9: OK (Not 7, Not 8)\n    *   O @ pos 8: OK (Not 6, Not 7)\n    *   T @ pos 6: OK (Not 4, Not 5)\n*   Let's re-check the yellow\/green results for the previous guesses if the word was ADDICTION:\n    *   Guess 1 (CREATIONS): C(y), R(g), E(g), A(y), T(y), I(y), O(y), N(y), S(g). All match the expected colors for ADDICTION.\n    *   Guess 2 (DICTIONAL): D(y), I(y), C(y), T(y), I(y), O(y), N(y), A(y), L(g). All match the expected colors for ADDICTION (no greens expected as D!=1, I!=2, C!=3, T!=4).\n\nADDICTION fits all the available information perfectly. Therefore, it is the best guess for the next attempt.\n\nAnswer: ADDICTION","Okay, let's break down the clues from the Wordle board.\n\n1.  **Guess 1: CREATIONS**\n    *   C, A, T, I, O, N are in the word (Yellow).\n    *   R, E, S are not in the word (Gray).\n    *   None are in the correct position shown in this guess.\n\n2.  **Guess 2: DICTIONAL**\n    *   D, I, C, T, I, O, N, A are in the word (Yellow). (Note: Double 'I')\n    *   L is not in the word (Gray).\n    *   None are in the correct position shown in this guess.\n\n3.  **Guess 3: ADDICTION**\n    *   A (pos 1), D (pos 3), C (pos 5), T (pos 6), O (pos 8), N (pos 9) are in the correct position (Green).\n    *   D (pos 2) is in the word but not in position 2 (Yellow).\n    *   I (pos 4) is in the word but not in position 4 (Yellow).\n    *   I (pos 7) is in the word but not in position 7 (Yellow).\n    *   This guess confirms the letters are A, D, D, I, C, T, I, O, N.\n\n**Combining the Clues:**\n\n*   The secret word has 9 letters.\n*   The letters are exactly: A, D, D, I, I, C, T, O, N.\n*   The known structure is: A _ D _ C T _ O N.\n*   The letters to fill the blanks (positions 2, 4, 7) are: D, I, I.\n*   We have constraints from the yellow letters in Guess 3:\n    *   Position 2 cannot be D.\n    *   Position 4 cannot be I.\n    *   Position 7 cannot be I.\n\n**Placing the Remaining Letters:**\n\n*   **Position 2:** Cannot be D. Must be I.\n    *   Word: A I D _ C T _ O N\n    *   Remaining letters to place: D, I\n    *   Remaining positions: 4, 7\n*   **Position 4:** Cannot be I. Must be D.\n    *   Word: A I D D C T _ O N\n    *   Remaining letters to place: I\n    *   Remaining positions: 7\n*   **Position 7:** Cannot be I. But the only remaining letter is I. Let's re-check the logic. The constraint \"I is not in position 7\" comes from the I *at* position 7 in the guess \"ADDICTION\". This means *that specific* I is misplaced. However, since the word must contain two Is, and we know position 4 cannot be I, position 2 must be I, the remaining I *must* go in position 7. The yellow clue for I at pos 7 confirms that I is not the correct letter *for* position 7 *if we assumed the first I (from pos 4 guess) went there*. But since the other I must go in pos 2, the second I has to go in pos 7. The only logical placement fitting the fixed letters and known letter pool is indeed I.\n\nLet's try the placement again based on elimination:\n*   We need to place D, I, I in positions 2, 4, 7.\n*   Position 2 cannot be D. So Position 2 must be I.\n*   Position 4 cannot be I. So Position 4 must be D.\n*   Position 7 cannot be I (from the yellow I in guess 3). So Position 7 must be ... the only remaining letter is I.\n\nThis seems contradictory, but let's reconsider the Wordle yellow rule with duplicates. The feedback A(G) D(Y) D(G) I(Y) C(G) T(G) I(Y) O(G) N(G) for the guess ADDICTION is generated by comparing it to the target word. If the target word were AIDDCTION, the comparison works exactly as described in the thought process:\nA vs A -> Green\nD vs I -> Yellow (D exists elsewhere, pos 2 != D)\nD vs D -> Green\nI vs D -> Yellow (I exists elsewhere, pos 4 != I)\nC vs C -> Green\nT vs T -> Green\nI vs I -> Yellow (This I exists elsewhere, pos 7 != I for this specific I instance in the guess relative to the target letters available after matching greens\/yellows). The simulation confirms this pattern matches.\n\nTherefore, the only word consistent with all the clues is AIDDCTION.\n\nAnswer: AIDDCTION","Based on the Wordle rules and the provided grid image:\n\n1.  **Analyze Guess 1 (CREATIONS):**\n    *   C, A, T, I, O, N are in the word (Yellow).\n    *   R, E, S are not in the word (Gray).\n2.  **Analyze Guess 2 (DICTIONAL):**\n    *   D, I, C, T, I, O, N, A are in the word (Yellow).\n    *   L is not in the word (Gray).\n    *   Combined excluded letters: R, E, S, L.\n    *   Known letters: A, C, D, I, N, O, T (at least one I).\n3.  **Analyze Guess 3 (ADDICTION):**\n    *   A(1), D(3), C(5), T(6), I(7), N(9) are Green (correct letter, correct position).\n    *   D(2), I(4), O(8) are Yellow (correct letter, wrong position).\n    *   This guess confirms the letters A, D, D, I, C, T, I, O, N are in the word.

Therefore, I must be in position 8.\n    *   Constraint: O is not in position 8 (from G3 and G4). Therefore, O must be in position 2.\n6.  **Final Word:**\n    *   Filling the blanks in the pattern A _ D D C T I _ N with O at position 2 and I at position 8 gives: A O D D C T I I N.\n\nThis word is consistent with all the clues provided in the four guesses.\n\nAnswer: AODDCTIIN","Based on the clues from the first 5 guesses:\n\n1.  **CREATIONS**: C(Y), R(X), E(X), A(Y), T(Y), I(Y), O(Y), N(Y), S(X)\n    *   Letters in word: C, A, T, I, O, N\n    *   Letters not in word: R, E, S\n2.  **DICTIONAL**: D(Y), I(Y), C(Y), T(Y), I(Y), O(Y), N(Y), A(Y), L(X)\n    *   Letters in word: C, A, T, I, O, N, D\n    *   Letters not in word: R, E, S, L\n3.  **ADDICTION**: A(G) D(Y) D(G) I(Y) C(G) T(G) I(G) O(G) N(G)\n    *   Pattern: A _ D _ C T I O N\n    *   Contains D (not at pos 2), contains I (not at pos 4).

This confirms the placement of D at pos 3 and 4, and I at pos 7, O at pos 8, N at pos 9. The yellow I at pos 2 confirms I is not at pos 2 and strongly suggests only one I exists (at pos 7).\n5.  **AODDCTION**: A(G) O(Y) D(G) D(G) C(G) T(G) I(G) I(Y) N(G)\n    *   Pattern: A _ D D C T I _ N\n    *   Contains O (not at pos 2). Since we know O is in the word (from CREATIONS, DICTIONAL) and not at pos 6, 7 (from DICTIONAL, CREATIONS) or 2 (this guess), and pos 8 was green O in guess 4, this guess seems inconsistent with guess 4 if O was green there. However, let's strictly follow the colors given for Guess 5: A(G) O(Y) D(G) D(G) C(G) T(G) I(G) I(Y) N(G).\n    *   This confirms the structure A _ D D C T I _ N.\n    *   O is in the word, not at pos 2.

This seems contradictory based on the images.\n    *   Position 4 constraints: Pos 4 != I (G3), Pos 4 != D (G4), Pos 4 != D (G5). This implies Pos 4 must be O.\n    *   Position 8 constraints: Pos 8 != O (G3), Pos 8 != O (G4), Pos 8 != I (G5). This implies Pos 8 must be D.\n\n5.  **Resolution:** If Pos 4 = O and Pos 8 = D, the only remaining letter for Pos 2 is I. This gives the word AIDOCTIDN.

If the letters D, I, O must go into positions 2, 4, 8, but the clues indicate none of them can go into any of these positions, then the clues provided in the image must be inconsistent or contain errors.\n\n**Finding the Best Fit Despite Contradiction:**\nAssuming there's an error in the displayed hints, let's test possible words against the constraints from each guess. The pattern is A _ D _ C T I _ N, and the letters to fill are D, I, O.\nPossible words:\n1.  AODDICTIIN (O2, D4, I8)\n2.  AIDDICTON (I2, D4, O8)\n3.  ADDOCTIIN (D2, O4, I8)\n4.  ADDICTOIN (D2, I4, O8)\n5.  AIODCTIDN (I2, O4, D8)\n6.  AODICTIDN (O2, I4, D8)\n\nLet's check which word is most consistent with the feedback, particularly the later guesses which might be more reliable if there were earlier errors.\nLet's check ADDICTOIN (D2, I4, O8):\n*   G3 constraints (D!=2, I!=4, O!=8): Fails (all violated)\n*   G4 constraints (I!=2, D!=4, O!=8): Fails (O=8 violated)\n*   G5 constraints (O!=2, D!=4, I!=8): Fits (D=2 OK, I=4 OK, O=8 OK)\n*   G6 constraints (I!=2, O!=4, D!=8): Fits (D=2 OK, I=4 OK, O=8 OK)\n\nADDICTOIN is consistent with the yellow clues from the last two guesses (G5 and G6), although inconsistent with G3 and G4. Given the contradiction, this seems the most plausible candidate, assuming errors occurred in the display of feedback for guesses 3 and 4.\n\nThe next logical guess is ADDICTOIN.\n\nAnswer: ADDICTOIN","Okay, let's analyze the Wordle board step by step.\n\n1.  **Analyze Attempt 1 (CREATIONS):**\n    *   Yellow: C, A, T, I, O, N\n    *   Gray: R, E, S\n    *   Letters in word: C, A, T, I, O, N (all misplaced)\n    *   Letters not in word: R, E, S\n\n2.  **Analyze Attempt 2 (DICTIONAL):**\n    *   Yellow: D, I, C, T, I, O, N, A\n    *   Gray: L\n    *   Letters in word: D, I, C, T, I, O, N, A (all misplaced, confirms two 'I's or one 'I' not in pos 2 or 5)\n    *   Letters not in word: R, E, S, L\n\n3.  **Analyze Attempt 3 (ADDICTION):**\n    *   Green: A (1), D (3), C (5), T (6), I (7), O (8), N (9)\n    *   Yellow: D (pos 2), I (pos 4)\n    *   Structure: A _ D _ C T I O N\n    *   Letters confirmed: A, D, D, I, C, T, I, O, N (Two D's, two I's).\n    *   Constraints: D is not in pos 2.

Letters: D, I, O, I.\n    *   Constraints: D!=2, I!=4, O!=7, I!=8.\n    *   Deduction: The two I's must go in positions 2 and 7. D and O must go in positions 4 and 8. Leads to two possibilities: A I D D C T I O N or A I D O C T I D N.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere are inconsistencies in the feedback provided across attempts, particularly the feedback for Attempt 4 (A I D D C T I O N giving I(Y)@2) and Attempt 6 (A I D O C T I D N giving I(Y)@2, O(Y)@4, D(Y)@8).\n\nHowever, the word A I D D C T I O N is strongly suggested by:\n*   The logical deduction from Attempt 3.\n*   Being one of the two possibilities derived from the latest Attempt 7.\n*   Checking its validity against the feedback shown for attempts 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 reveals consistency (as detailed in the thought block). The only inconsistent feedback image is the one for Attempt 4 itself.\n\nGiven that A I D D C T I O N fits almost all the data except for the paradoxical feedback for the attempt where it was guessed, it's the most likely candidate, assuming a single error in the displayed feedback for attempt 4.\n\nAnswer: A I D D C T I O N","Okay, let's analyze the Wordle board state.\n\n1.  **Word Length:** 9 letters.\n2.  **Attempts Made:** 7 out of 10.\n3.  **Goal:** Find the secret 9-letter word.\n\n**Analysis of Guesses:**\n\n*   **Guess 1:** CREATIONS (C Y, R G, E G, A Y, T Y, I Y, O Y, N Y, S G) - R, E, S are not in the word.

The presence of yellow 'I's when another 'I' is already green might suggest there are multiple 'I's, but the yellow feedback specifically rules out positions 2 and 4 for *any* 'I'.\n\n5.  **Identify Repeated Letters:**\n    *   The word has 9 letters. We have identified 7 unique letters (A, D, C, T, I, O, N) from the green tiles. Therefore, two letters must be repeated.\n    *   Guess 3 (ADDICTION) had two yellow Ds: D(Y) at pos 2, D(Y) at pos 3. This strongly suggests the word contains two Ds.\n    *   Guess 7 (ADDICOTIN) and Guess 8 (AIDICTON) had two yellow Is (besides the green I). This suggests the word might contain two Is.\n    *   If the word contains two Ds and two Is, the letters are A, D, D, I, I, C, T, O, N. This set has 9 letters.\n\n6.  **Fill the Blanks:**\n    *   The pattern is `A _ D _ C T I O N`.\n    *   The missing positions are 2 and 4.\n    *   The letters to place are the remaining ones from the set {A, D, D, I, I, C, T, O, N} after filling the green positions {A, D, C, T, I, O, N}. The letters needed are D and I.\n    *   We need to place D and I into positions 2 and 4.\n\n7.  **Contradiction Check:**\n    *   From yellow clues across multiple guesses (though some were inconsistent):\n        *   Pos 2 cannot be I (Guess 4, 6, 8)\n        *   Pos 2 cannot be D (Guess 3, 7)\n        *   Pos 4 cannot be I (Guess 7, 8)\n        *   Pos 4 cannot be D (Guess 4, 5)\n    *   If we must place D and I into positions 2 and 4, but position 2 cannot be D or I, and position 4 cannot be D or I, there's a logical contradiction based on the provided colour hints. The hints seem inconsistent or follow non-standard rules.\n\n8.  **Best Guess:** Despite the contradictions in the yellow hints, the word `ADDICTION` fits the green pattern `A _ D _ C T I O N` by placing D in position 2 and D in position 3. However, guess 3 showed A(G) D(Y) D(Y) I(G)... and later guesses confirmed D(G) at position 3. The structure `ADDICTION` (A D D I C T I O N) uses the likely letters (A, D, D, I, C, T, I, O, N - assuming one I was misplaced in earlier guesses or the double I hint is wrong) and matches the fixed green letters A(1) D(3) I(4) C(5) T(6) I(7) O(8) N(9). Wait, Guess 3 shows I(G) at 4, not D. This conflicts with D(G) at 3 later.\n    Let's stick to the most stable green pattern: A(1) _ D(3) _ C(5) T(6) I(7) O(8) N(9).\n    The most plausible word fitting this structure and suggested letters (especially the double D from Guess 3) is ADDICTION. We place D at 2 and the second D at 3 (which is green). A D D _ C T I O N. Position 4 needs filling. If the letters are A,D,D,I,C,T,I,O,N, then I goes to 4. Word: A D D I C T I O N. This matches the green I at 4 from Guess 3.\n\nLet's assume the word is ADDICTION, acknowledging the inconsistent coloring in the provided images.\n\nAnswer: ADDICTION","Based on the state of the Wordle grid after 9 attempts, let's deduce the secret word.\n\n1.  **Analyze the constraints from the latest attempt (Row 9):**\n    *   Guess: `A D D I C T I O N`\n    *   Feedback:\n        *   Green (Correct position): A (1), D (3), C (5), T (6), I (7), O (8), N (9)\n        *   Yellow (Correct letter, wrong position): D (2), I (4)\n        *   Gray (Letter not in word): None relevant here.\n\n2.  **Determine the fixed structure:**\n    From the green letters in the 9th attempt, we know the word has the structure:\n    `A _ D _ C T I O N`\n\n3.  **Place the yellow letters:**\n    *   The yellow letters from the 9th attempt are D and I.\n    *   These letters must fill the blank positions (2 and 4).\n    *   The feedback tells us:\n        *   D is not in position 2.\n        *   I is not in position 4.\n    *   Therefore, D must go in the only other available blank, which is position 4.\n    *   And I must go in the only other available blank, which is position 2.\n\n4.  **Construct the final word:**\n    Placing I in position 2 and D in position 4 into the structure `A _ D _ C T I O N` gives:\n    `A I D D C T I O N`\n\n5.  **Verification (Optional but good practice):**\n    Let's check if `A I D D C T I O N` is consistent with the feedback for Row 9's guess (`A D D I C T I O N`):\n    *   A (pos 1) vs A: Green -> Correct\n    *   D (pos 2) vs I: D is in the word but wrong position -> Yellow -> Correct\n    *   D (pos 3) vs D: Green -> Correct\n    *   I (pos 4) vs D: I is in the word but wrong position -> Yellow -> Correct\n    *   C (pos 5) vs C: Green -> Correct\n    *   T (pos 6) vs T: Green -> Correct\n    *   I (pos 7) vs I: Green -> Correct\n    *   O (pos 8) vs O: Green -> Correct\n    *   N (pos 9) vs N: Green -> Correct\n    The derived word `A I D D C T I O N` perfectly matches the feedback given for the 9th guess.\n\nAnswer: AIDDICTION","Okay, let's analyze the game state step by step.\nThe word length is 9. This is the 10th and final attempt.\nWe need to use the information from the previous 9 guesses to find the secret word.\n\nLet's focus on the latest guess (Guess 9) as it provides the most current information:\nGuess 9 word: ADDICTION\nColors: A(Green, Pos 1), D(Yellow, Pos 2), D(Green, Pos 3), I(Yellow, Pos 4), C(Green, Pos 5), T(Green, Pos 6), I(Green, Pos 7), O(Yellow, Pos 8), N(Green, Pos 9)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n1.  The secret word has the following letters fixed in these positions:\n    A _ D _ C T I _ N (Positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9 are Green)\n2.  The secret word contains the letters D, I, O (from the Yellow tiles in Guess 9).\n3.  The letter D is not in position 2.\n4.  The letter I is not in position 4.\n5.  The letter O is not in position 8.\n6.  The letters present in the word are exactly A, D, D, I, I, C, T, O, N (one A, two D's, two I's, one C, one T, one O, one N).\n\nWe need to place the remaining three letters (D, I, O) into the remaining three positions (2, 4, 8).\n\nLet's list the possible permutations for positions (2, 4, 8) using letters (D, I, O) and check against the constraints from Guess 9 (W2≠D, W4≠I, W8≠O):\n1.  (D, I, O): A D D I C T I O N - Fails (W2=D, W4=I, W8=O)\n2.  (D, O, I): A D D O C T I I N - Fails (W2=D)\n3.  (I, D, O): A I D D C T I O N - Fails (W8=O)\n4.  (I, O, D): A I D O C T I D N - Valid according to G9 constraints.\n5.  (O, D, I): A O D D C T I I N - Valid according to G9 constraints.\n6.  (O, I, D): A O D I C T I D N - Fails (W4=I)\n\nSo, based only on Guess 9, the possible words are AIDOCTIDN or AODDCTIIN.\n\nNow, let's check these two candidates against the constraints from earlier guesses. We found contradictions in the thought process, suggesting some earlier hints might be inconsistent.

Inconsistent.\n    - N9(G) vs N9(G) - OK\n    AODDCTIIN is inconsistent with the colors shown for guess 5.\n\nLet's test Candidate AIDOCTIDN (A(1) I(2) D(3) O(4) C(5) T(6) I(7) D(8) N(9)):\n- Check against G9 (ADDICTION): A(G) D(Y) D(G) I(Y) C(G) T(G) I(G) O(Y) N(G).\n    - A1(G) vs A1(G) - OK\n    - D2(Y) vs I2 - D exists (pos 3,8), not pos 2 -> Yellow - OK\n    - D3(G) vs D3(G) - OK\n    - I4(Y) vs O4 - I exists (pos 2,7), not pos 4 -> Yellow - OK\n    - C5(G) vs C5(G) - OK\n    - T6(G) vs T6(G) - OK\n    - I7(G) vs I7(G) - OK\n    - O8(Y) vs D8 - O exists (pos 4), not pos 8 -> Yellow - OK\n    - N9(G) vs N9(G) - OK\n    AIDOCTIDN is fully consistent with the colors shown for guess 9.\n\n- Check against G6 (AIDOCITDN): A(G) I(Y) D(G) O(Y) C(G) T(G) I(G) D(Y) N(G).\n    - A1(G) vs A1(G) - OK\n    - I2(Y) vs I2 - Should be GREEN! Inconsistent.\n    - D3(G) vs D3(G) - OK\n    - O4(Y) vs O4 - Should be GREEN! Inconsistent.\n    - C5(G) vs C5(G) - OK\n    - T6(G) vs T6(G) - OK\n    - I7(G) vs I7(G) - OK\n    - D8(Y) vs D8 - Should be GREEN! Inconsistent.\n    - N9(G) vs N9(G) - OK\n    AIDOCTIDN is inconsistent with the colors shown for guess 6.\n\nBoth candidates are consistent with the last guess (G9) but inconsistent with some earlier guesses (G5 for AODDCTIIN, G6 for AIDOCTIDN). This suggests errors in the provided game images\/state. However, AODDCTIIN was consistent with G9, G8, G7, G6 when checked manually in thought, while AIDOCTIDN failed G8 and G6 quite badly. Rechecking G6 consistency for AODDCTIIN:\nGuess: AIDOCITDN. Target: AODDCTIIN.\nA1: G vs G - OK\nI2: Y vs O2 - I exists (7,8), not 2 -> Yellow - OK\nD3: G vs D3 - OK\nO4: Y vs D4 - O exists (2), not 4 -> Yellow - OK\nC5: G vs C5 - OK\nT6: G vs T6 - OK\nI7: G vs I7 - OK\nD8: Y vs I8 - D exists (3,4), not 8 -> Yellow - OK\nN9: G vs N9 - OK\nYes, AODDCTIIN is consistent with G6. It seems my earlier check was wrong. Let's recheck G7.\nGuess: ADDICOTIN. Target: AODDCTIIN.\nA1: G vs G - OK\nD2: Y vs O2 - D exists (3,4), not 2 -> Yellow - OK\nD3: G vs D3 - OK\nI4: Y vs D4 - I exists (7,8), not 4 -> Yellow - OK\nC5: G vs C5 - OK\nT6: G vs T6 - OK\nO7: Y vs I7 - O exists (2), not 7 -> Yellow - OK\nI8: Y vs I8 - Should be GREEN! No, wait. I at pos 8 is part of the target AODDCTIIN. The guess used I at pos 8. So it should be green? Let me re-read the rule. Green = correct letter in correct position. Yellow = letter exists but wrong position. In the target AODDCTIIN, I is at pos 8. In the guess ADDICOTIN, I is at pos 8. It should be Green. The image shows Yellow. So G7 is also inconsistent for AODDCTIIN.\n\nRecheck G8:\nGuess: AIDICTION. Target: AODDCTIIN.\nA1: G vs G - OK\nI2: Y vs O2 - I exists (7,8), not 2 -> Yellow - OK\nD3: G vs D3 - OK\nI4: Y vs D4 - I exists (7,8), not 4 -> Yellow - OK\nC5: G vs C5 - OK\nT6: G vs T6 - OK\nI7: G vs I7 - OK\nO8: Y vs I8 - O exists (2), not 8 -> Yellow - OK\nN9: G vs N9 - OK\nAODDCTIIN is consistent with G8.\n\nSo AODDCTIIN is consistent with G9, G8, G6, but inconsistent with G7 (I8 Yellow should be Green) and G5 (O2 Yellow should be Green, I8 Yellow should be Green).\nAIDOCTIDN is consistent with G9, but inconsistent with G6 (I2Y, O4Y, D8Y should be Green).\n\nGiven that AODDCTIIN passes the consistency check for the most recent guess (G9) and several others (G8, G6), and its inconsistencies (G5, G7) might stem from errors in those specific rows, it remains the most likely candidate despite the conflicting information.\n\nAnswer: AODDCTIIN"],"have_image":true}
