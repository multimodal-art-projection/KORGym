Since 'R' and 'A' are yellow, it means that 'R' cannot be in the second position and 'A' cannot be in the third position.\n\nSo let's try 'BRAIN'\n\nAnswer: BRAIN","Okay, let's analyze the Wordle board.\n\nHere's what we know:\n*   The word length is 5.\n*   We have attempted 8 guesses, leaving us with 2 attempts.\n*   From the guesses, we know the following:\n    *   'A', 'R', and 'O' exist in the word.\n    *   'U', 'D', 'I', 'M', 'S', 'T', 'E', 'V', and 'H' do not exist in the word.\n    *   'B' is in the first position (green).\n    *   'N' is in the fifth position (green).\n    *   'R' and 'A' are somewhere in the word, but not in the second or third positions, respectively.\n    *   From the last two guesses (BRAIN, BRAN), we see that the letter 'I' is absent from the last guess.\n\nBased on all of this, the word must be of the form \"B _ _ A N\". The second letter cannot be 'R' or 'A', and must contain one of those letters.\n\nSince R is not the second letter and A is the fourth, let's explore words that fit this pattern. 'BRAIN' and 'BRAN' have been tried. The second letter cannot be 'U, D, I, M, S, T, E, V, H'. The remaining available letters are 'C, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z'.\n\nWhat about 'BRA _ N'? Can it be 'BRAWN'? No, 'W' is unavailable. 'BLARN' doesn't appear to be a valid word.\n\nI missed the information about 'O' existing in the word. 'O' is not the second letter, so it could be in the third position: 'BOARN'. But 'BOARN' isn't a known word.\n\nGiven that we only have two attempts left, the second letter is more than likely an A or R, as we deduced that it is most likely a double letter. From the fourth guess, it also doesn't seem like a letter is repeated in the word.\n\nConsidering 'B _ A _ N', the only remaining letter available to us that is frequently found in english is 'L'. That's it. Therefore, maybe we have to reuse a letter. 'BLAHN' doesn't appear to be a valid word. Since we already tried Brain, let's try 'BROAN'.\n\nAnswer: BROAN","Okay, I will analyze the game board to determine the next best guess.\n\nFrom the history, we can see:\n- The first letter is likely 'B'\n- 'R' and 'A' are present, but their positions are not fixed.\n- 'N' is likely in the last position.\n- Letters ruled out: 'U', 'D', 'I', 'O', 'M', 'S', 'T', 'E', 'V', 'H'.\n\nConsidering the information, the word must be in the format: B R A _ N.\nSince 'O' is also present, and we haven't tested its position, the last try used 'B R O A N'.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be BRAIN\n\nAnswer: BRAIN"],"have_image":true}

Let's try \"GALLOP\".\n\nAnswer: GALLOP","Okay, let's analyze the Wordle grid.\n\n*   **Row 1:** O, R, A, N, G, E - No letters are correct.\n*   **Row 2:** G, E, O, A, L, S - G is green, E and O and A are yellow.\n*   **Row 3:** G, A, M, E, B, O - G and A are green, E and O are yellow.\n*   **Row 4:** G, A, L, O, O, T - G and A are green, O is yellow.\n*   **Row 5:** G, A, Z, O, O, O - G and A are green, O is yellow.\n*   **Row 6:** G, A, L, O, O, T - G and A are green, O is yellow.\n*   **Row 7:** G, A, L, O, O, T - G and A are green, O is yellow.\n*   **Row 8:** G, A, L, L, O, P - G and A are green, O is yellow.\n*   **Row 9:** G, A, L, L, O, P - G and A are green, O is yellow.\n\nFrom this we know:\n\n*   The word starts with \"GA\".\n*   The word contains the letter \"O\".\n*   L, T, Z, P, M, E, R, N, S are not in the word.\n\nLet's think about the possible positions for \"O\". From rows 4,5,6,7,8,9 we can determine that the \"O\" should be the fifth letter. And the word contains one \"O\".\nSo the word should be GA**O**. And since L is already tested, it's probably not L, it's probably S, and we know E is not the last letter. So let's try \"GALOOT\".\n\nBased on the current information, \"GALLOP\" seems like the most promising word.\n\nAnswer: GALLOP"],"have_image":true}

'R' is in the wrong position. 'I', 'G', 'N', 'L' are not present.\nThe second guess 'OVERFLOW' tells us about placement. We now know that the second letter is 'V', the third is 'E', and the fourth is 'R'. The sixth letter is not 'L'. The word also contains an 'O', but the eighth letter is not 'W'.\nFrom the other attempts, 'OVERLOOK', 'OVERLOAD', 'OVERLOOK', 'OVERLOOK' and 'OVERLOOK' we have tried placing 'O' as the sixth and seventh letter. It works for the sixth position. We also know that 'K' and 'D' are not in the word, as well as 'F' and 'L'.\nSo we have O V E R * O O *.\n\nWe need another vowel in the last position.\n\nI think OVERLDO or OVERLOOK are good guesses.\n\nLet's try OVERBOOK\nAnswer: OVERBOOK","Okay, I will play Wordle.\n\nBased on the information, the word length is 8, and I have 2 attempts left.\nHere's what I know:\n*   'O' is in the first position (green).\n*   'V', 'E', and 'R' are in the second, third, and fourth positions, respectively (green).\n*   'O' is present in the word, but not in the sixth position (yellow).\n*   'O' is present in the word, and is in the seventh position (green).\n*   'K' is not present in the word, because it is gray in the last 4 attempts.\n\nSo the word has the form: O V E R _ O O _.\n\nFrom attempt 3 to 7, 'L' is in the 5th position, but in attempt 8, 'B' is in the 5th position. However, the color of the square containing 'B' is gray, so we could exclude letter 'B'. Also, 'L' became gray, so we should not use 'L'.\n\nConsider the letter 'R' in the second attempt, 'R' is gray. Therefore, 'R' is not the second letter.\n\nGiven the known letters and constraints, a valid guess is \"OVERDUEO\".\n\nAnswer: OVERDUEO","Okay, I will analyze the Wordle board and provide a guess based on the information.\n\nFrom the grid, we know the following:\n* The word is 8 letters long.\n* The first letter is 'O' and the second letter is 'V' and the third letter is 'E' and the fourth letter is 'R'.\n* The sixth letter is 'O' and the seventh letter is 'O'.\n* We've tried 'ORIGINAL', 'OVERFLOW', 'OVERLOOK', 'OVERLOAD', 'OVERLOOK', 'OVERLOOK', 'OVERLOOK', 'OVERBOOK', 'OVERDUO'.\n* We know that 'A', 'D', 'L','K','B','D','U','E' are not the eight letter.\n* 'R' is not the second letter.\nBased on the above analysis, it seems likely that the word is OVERLOOK.\n\nAnswer: OVERLOOK"],"have_image":true}

My next guess will be a word fitting the pattern 'G A L L _ Y'. A possible guess would be 'GALLOP'.\n\nAnswer: GALLOP","Okay, let's analyze the Wordle clues.\n\nFrom the image, we know the word length is 6.\n\nHere's what we know from the attempts:\n\n1.  ADJUST: A is yellow.\n2.  BLAC\\*\\*KY\\*\\*: L and A are yellow, Y is green.\n3.  SALARY: A and L are green.\n4.  VALL\\*\\*EY\\*\\*: A and L are green, the second L is yellow.\n5.  GALL\\*\\*AY\\*\\*: G, A, and L are green, the second L is yellow, Y is green, and A is yellow.\n6.  GALL\\*\\*YA\\*\\*: G, A, and L are green, the second L is yellow, Y is yellow, A is yellow.\n7.  GALL\\*\\*OP\\*\\*: G, A, and L are green, the second L is yellow.\n\nSo the word is GA L L \\_ Y. The possible options are GALLOP, GALLOW, GALLYA. The second L is not in the fourth position. The fifth position should be a vowel.\n\nLet's try GALLYA. Since A is yellow.\nLet's try GALLOW.\n\nAnswer: GALLOW","Okay, let's analyze the Wordle board.\n\nHere's what we know:\n*   The word length is 6.\n*   We have 8 attempts remaining.\n*   The second letter is A.\n*   The third letter is L.\n*   The last letter is Y.\n*   From the 5th row, 6th row, 7th row, and 8th row, we know the first letter is likely G.\n*   From the 4th row, we know that E is not the fifth letter.\n*   From the 5th row, we know that A is not the fifth letter.\n*   From the 6th row, we know that Y is not the fifth letter.\n*   From the 7th row, we know that O is not the fifth letter.\n*   From the 8th row, we know that O is not the fifth letter.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities based on the known letters: G A L L _ Y. We also know that A, E, O and Y are not in the fifth place.\n\nGiven the constraints, a possible word is \"GALLOP\", but the image indicates that 'O' is not the fifth letter. Considering that there are two 'L's and 'A' at 2nd and 3rd places and 'Y' at the last. Let's try \"GALLAY\". The word \"GALAXY\" does not fit as the 4th attempt.\nThe word \"GALLANT\" does not fit the fifth attempt as it contains 'A', which is yellow at first attempt.\n\nLet's try \"GALLOP\". The image contains gray for the fifth letter 'O', indicating that 'O' is not in the word.\n\nGiven the information on the board, a strong candidate seems to be \"GALLON\", but 'O' is already eliminated as it is a gray letter. Therefore, there is no such word.\n\nConsidering the fourth letter is 'L'. Therefore, the word should contain two 'L's in the word.\n\nNow let's consider that the word starts with a 'G' and has 'A', 'L', and 'Y' at the mentioned locations.\n\nBased on the grid, it appears the word might be \"GALLY\", but it is a 5 letter word.\n\nBased on the above observations, there is no valid 6-letter word. Given that the first is G, the second is A, the third is L, and the last is Y and the remaining letters should be L and one of {B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Z}.\n\nLet's analyze one more time:\n1. The word contains the letters A, L, and Y.\n2. A is the second letter and L is the third letter. Y is the sixth letter.\n3. The first letter is G.\n4. \"GALLUP\" is a possible word. However, \"U\" appears in the first row as grayed out.\nThe word could be \"GALLOP\", but the image shows O as gray.\n\nSince there is no good candidate, it could be that OCR read the image wrong and that O is actually a gray letter on the grid, but maybe it is not.\n\nGiven that, if the first letter is not 'G', then we cannot identify the word.\n\n```text\n\n```\nAnswer: No valid answer\n","Okay, I will analyze the Wordle board and make my next guess.\n\nHere's what I know:\n*   The word is 6 letters long.\n*   The second letter is 'A'.\n*   The third letter is 'L'.\n*   The fifth letter is very likely not 'A' or 'L'.\n*   The sixth letter is 'Y'.\n*   'A' is in the first position, but it's the wrong position.\n*   'L' is in the fourth position, but it's the wrong position.\n*   Letters 'D', 'J', 'U', 'S', 'T', 'B', 'C', 'K', 'S', 'R', 'V', 'E', 'O', 'P', and 'W' are not in the word.\n\nPossible words given the letters include \"GALAXY\".

Given that word length is 11, it cannot be RETAININGIN (12 letters)\nSo the correct word must be **RETAININGLY**.\n\nAnswer: RETAININGLY","Okay, let's analyze the Wordle clues.\n\n*   **Attempt 1:** \"ABANDONMENT\" - A, B, D, O, M, E, and T are out. N appears, but not in positions 4, 6, or 9. A appears, but not in positions 1 or 3.\n*   **Attempt 2:** \"TRANSACTION\" - T, R, and A are in the word, but not in positions 1, 2, or 3. S and C are out. I and O are in the word, but I is in the wrong position (position 9). N is in the word, but not in position 11.\n*   **Attempt 3:** \"RETAININGINN\" - R, E, T, A, I, N are in the word. R, T are in the correct positions (1 and 3). N is in the correct position (6). I is in the correct position (8). G is out.\n*   **Attempt 4:** \"RETAININGLY\" - R, E, T, A, I, N are in the word. R, T are in the correct positions (1 and 3). N is in the correct position (6). I is in the correct position (8). G, L, and Y are out.\n\nBased on this, the word must start with \"RE\\_TAI\\_I\\_N\". We know that \"E\" is in the second position. The missing letters could be a vowel or consonant that fits the pattern. Possible candidates include \"RETAILORING\" and \"RETAINERSHIP\".\n\nLet's try \"RETAILORING\".\n\nAnswer: RETAILORING","Okay, I will analyze the Wordle grid and make an educated guess.\n\nFrom the grid, I can see the following:\n\n*   **Row 1:** A, N are present, but B, D, O, M, E, T are not.\n*   **Row 2:** T, R, A, N are present. S and C are not. I and O are present.\n*   **Row 3:** R, E, T, A, I, N, I are present. G is not.\n*   **Row 4:** R, E, T, A, I, N, I are present. G and Y are not.\n*   **Row 5:** R, E, T, A, I are present. L, O, R are also present but in wrong location. G is not.\n\nBased on this:\n\n*   The word starts with R.\n*   The 3rd letter is T.\n*   The 4th letter is A.\n*   The 6th letter is I.\n*   The 8th letter is N.\n*   Letters to avoid: B, C, D, G, M, O, S, Y.\n*   The word is 11 letters long.\n\nCombining these clues, the letters E and L are present.\n\nConsidering this, the word could be: \"RETAILINGLY\" or \"RELATIONING\". From the OCR outputs, letter \"O\" should be present at the middle, therefore \"RELATIONING\" is a better guess.\n\nAnswer: RELATIONING","Okay, let's analyze the Wordle grid.\n\n*   **Attempt 1:** ABANDONMENT - This gives us A, N, E, and T as letters in the word, but not in those positions. B, D, O, M are not in the word.\n*   **Attempt 2:** TRANSATION - This confirms R, A, T, I, and N. S and C are not in the word.\n*   **Attempt 3:** RETAININGIN - This gives us a green T and a green N.\n*   **Attempt 4:** RETAININGLY - It seems, G and L are not in the word.\n*   **Attempt 5:** RETAILORING - R, E, T, A, I are also yellow and the I is green.\n*   **Attempt 6:** RELATIONSING - The I is green.\n\nNow let's construct the word with what we know. It starts with R, contains E, has a T in the 3rd position, has an A, has an I in the 8th position, and has an N. The last letter is G.\n\nBased on this, the word is: **RELATIONING**.\n\nAnswer: RELATIONING","Okay, let's analyze the Wordle board.\n\nHere's what we know:\n\n*   The word is 11 letters long.\n*   We have 7 attempts remaining.\n*   R is the first letter (green).\n*   The third letter is T (green).\n*   The sixth letter is N (green).\n*   The ninth letter is I (green).\n*   The last letter is G (gray).\n\nBased on these pieces of information and past guesses, let's make some assumptions:\n\n*   E, A, I, O, L and T are in the word, but in the wrong positions in some cases.\n*   B, D, M, S, C, Y are not in the word.\n\nLet's check possible words that fit with this pattern\n\n*   RETALIATION\n*   RELATIONING\n\nSo the possibilities are decreasing, let's check other clues.\nThe last row has E, L, A, T, I, O, N in yellow, and N is the sixth letter in green, and the last letter is G (gray).\n\nSo based on current clues, the word is RETALIATION.\n\nAnswer: RETALIATION","Okay, I will analyze the Wordle board and try to make the best guess.\n\nHere's what I can gather from the board:\n\n*   **Guessed Letters:** A, B, C, D, E, G, I, L, M, N, O, R, S, T, Y\n*   **Excluded Letters (Gray):** B, D, S, C, G, L, Y\n*   **Green Letters (Correct Position):** The first letter is 'R', The third letter is 'T', the sixth letter is 'I', and the ninth letter is 'I'.\n*   **Yellow Letters (Present but Wrong Position):** A, E, N, O, T, R, I. The last guess 'RETALIATION' gives the most information about yellow letters.\n\nSo, based on this:\n\n*   The word starts with R, has a T in the third position, I in the 6th and 9th position.\n*   The letters A,E,O,N are present but not in the positions shown in the previous guesses.\n*   Letters B, D, S, C, G, L, and Y are not in the word.\n*   The last guess was 'RETALIATION' but it contains two As and two Ts, we can try an alternative like 'RETRIBUTIONS'\n\nNow, considering the above facts, I will make my next guess.\n\nNext guess: **RETRIBUTION**\n\nAnswer: RETRIBUTION","Okay, let's analyze the Wordle board.\n\nFrom the grid, we know the following:\n\n*   Row 3: `RETAININGIN` with `N` in the 6th position (index 5) being correct, `R`, `E`, `T`, `A`, `I` are present but misplaced, and `G` is absent.\n*   Row 4: `RETAILINGLY` tells us 'L', and `Y` are incorrect\n\nConsidering this, and what we know from the other rows, a possible answer would be a word that starts with R, contains E, T, A, I, and N with N being in 6th position. I will also consider that rows 7 and 8 show 'RELATIONING' where O is yellow in row 7.\n\nTrying the word \"RESILIATION\".\n\nAnswer: RESILIATION"],"have_image":true}

The letters R, E, T must be in the word. Since E is not in positions 2, 6 and 8, and T is not in position 5 and 7, R is not in position 1, it may be possible that \"REENTER\" is the word.\n\nANSWER: REENTER\nAnswer: REENTER","Okay, based on the information I have:\n\n*   The word length is 8.\n*   We have two previous guesses: \"COMPLETE\" and \"RESTATE\"\n*   From \"COMPLETE\":\n    *   C, O, M, P, L are not in the word.\n    *   E is in the word, but not in positions 6.\n    *   T is in the correct position in position 7.\n    *   E is in the correct position in position 8.\n*   From \"RESTATE\":\n    *   R is in the word, but not in position 1.\n    *   E is in the word, but not in position 2.\n    *   S, A are not in the word.\n    *   T is in the word, but not in positions 4.\n    *   E is in the correct position in position 8.\n\nNow, considering these constraints, a possible guess is \"ENTERITE\".\n\nAnswer: ENTERITE","Okay, based on the Wordle game board, here's my analysis and next guess:\n\n*   **Known Correct Letters:** The 7th and 8th letters are 'T' and 'E' respectively.\n*   **Known Present Letters:** 'R', 'E', 'S', 'T', 'A', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'N', 'T', 'E', 'R', 'I' are present in the word, but not in the locations already marked grey. 'E' appears to be important.\n*   **Known Absent Letters:** 'C', 'O', 'M', 'P', 'L' are not in the word.\n*   **Deductions:** From the first row, we know that 'E' is present, so let's think of words ending in 'TE' that use the other letters we have found. Looking at the second row we can try to place 'R' and 'T'. 'R' can not be in the first position, 'E' is likely to be in more than one position. The last row tells us that 'E', 'T' and 'R' must be in different places than in the row.

We can try RESTATEE, but the \"S\" and \"D\" have already been tried.\nLet's try words that fit the pattern, \"RE******TE\".

We also know that 'A' and 'T' exist in the word and 'R', 'E', 'S' exist in the word. Let's try something based on this.\nLet's try the word **TEMPLATE**. Since \"A\" is green in 7th position, TEMPLATE is wrong.\nI think the word might be **RELATED**.\n\nAnswer: RELATED","Okay, I will analyze the Wordle board to guess the word.\n\nFrom the board, I can see the following:\n\n*   The word length is 8.\n*   The last letter is 'E' (green).\n*   The seventh letter is 'T' (green).\n*   The sixth letter is 'A' (green).\n\nLooking at the previous guesses:\n\n*   The first guess eliminates 'C', 'O', 'M', 'P', 'L'.\n*   'E', 'R', 'S', 'T', 'A' are present in the word, but not in those positions.\n\nCombining these, the word must end in 'ATE'.\nReviewing previous guesses, letters 'R','E','S', and 'T' are present in the word, but are not in their guessed positions. In the fifth and sixth attempts, we tried 'RESTATE' but got it incorrect. In addition, we know 'H' and 'O' from \"THEORATE' do not work. The third guess, \"ENTERITE' does not work, eliminating 'N' and 'I'. \"TEMPLATE' (attempt 7) also did not work, eliminating 'M' and 'P' and 'L'.\n\nLet's look at available possibilities and letters available:\n\nRESERATE?\n\nBased on attempt 4 (RESTATE), 'S' cannot be in the third position, 'E' cannot be in position 2 or 5, 'R' cannot be in position 1.\n\nSince 'TEMPLATE' was used in attempt 7, it can be deduced the word begins with 'T'. The letters 'E','R', and 'S' must then be in positions 2,3,4,5. So we have 'T _ _ _ _ ATE'.\n\nThere is only one remaining attempt. Considering the letters 'E', 'R' and 'S', I believe the answer must be 'THEREATE'.\n\nAnswer: THEREATE","Okay, I will analyze the Wordle board and make the best guess.\n\nHere's what I can deduce:\n\n*   The word is 8 letters long.\n*   The last letter is E.\n*   The sixth letter is A.\n*   The seventh letter is T.\n*   The second, fourth, and fifth letters are possible candidates of 'E','R', and 'T'\n\nThe following letters are not in the word: C, O, M, P, L, I, D, O, H.\n\nBased on the available attempts and letter clues, a good guess is: \"THEREATE\".\n\nAnswer: THEREATE","Okay, I'll analyze the Wordle board and make a guess.\n\nHere's what I've gathered:\n\n*   **Word Length:** 8\n*   **Known Letters\/Positions:** The 7th and 8th letters are 'T' and 'E' respectively.

Since D, E, and A are already in the word, and 'D' and 'A' are yellow, we can try to guess a word where 'D' and 'A' are in different places.\n\nHow about: \"DAUNTED\"?\n\nAnswer: DAUNTED","Okay, let's analyze the Wordle board.\n\nWe know the word length is 8.\n\nFrom the first guess \"ABRIDGED\", we have:\n- A is yellow, so it exists in the word but not in the first position.\n- B, R, I, and G are gray, so they do not exist in the word.\n- D is yellow, so it exists in the word but not in the fifth or eighth positions.\n- E is green, so E is in the seventh position.\n\nFrom the second guess \"DEALERED\", we have:\n- D is yellow, so it exists in the word but not in the first or eighth positions.\n- E is yellow, so it exists in the word but not in the second position.\n- A is yellow, so it exists in the word but not in the third position.\n- L is yellow, so it exists in the word but not in the fourth position.\n- R is gray, so R does not exist in the word.\n\nFrom the third guess \"DEADENED\", we have:\n- D is yellow, so it exists in the word but not in the first or eighth positions.\n- E is yellow, so it exists in the word but not in the second position.\n- A is yellow, so it exists in the word but not in the third position.\n- D is yellow, so it exists in the word but not in the fourth position.\n- N is gray, so N does not exist in the word.\n\nBased on these clues, the word must contain A, D, and E, with E in the seventh position.\nAlso, A, D and E can't be at position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 respectively.\nSince A, D, E are present in the word, let's try to find possible arrangements.\n\nConsidering the placement of D, let's see if \"DECEASED\" works. The first 'E' can't be in position 2.\n\nLet's consider \"DEBASED\". B, R, I, G, and N are not in the word.\nSo, based on all the constraints, it seems likely that the word is \"DECEASED\".\n\nAnswer: DECEASED","Okay, let's analyze the Wordle board.\n\nWe know the word length is 8.  We have 4 guesses so far.\n\n*   **Guess 1:** A B R I D G E D - 'E' is correct in the 7th position. A, D are present in other positions.\n*   **Guess 2:** D E A L E R E D - 'E' is correct in the 7th position. D, E, A are present in other positions.\n*   **Guess 3:** D E A D E N E D - 'E' is correct in the 7th position. D, E, A are present in other positions.\n*   **Guess 4:** D E C E A S E D - 'E' is correct in the 7th position, 'A' is correct in the 6th position. 'D' and 'E' are present in other positions, 'C' and 'S' are not.\n\nSo far, we know the word is `_______E D`. We also know that the 6th letter is 'A', hence `_____A E D`.  Letters we can exclude are B, R, I, G, L, R, N, C and S. We need to use D and E, since the 1st 5 rows shows 'D' and 'E' are in yellow.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities. The first three guesses contained D, E, A. The fourth guess contained D,E,A in the 1st, 2nd, 6th and 7th positions. From the second guess (D E A L E R E D), we can see that the first D in our solution cannot be in the first position. From the 3rd and 4th guesses (D E A D E N E D, D E C E A S E D), the second letter also cannot be an 'E'. So the solution must be in the format `D ____A E D`\n\nLet's try the word \"DEARHEAD\".\n\nAnswer: DEARHEAD","Okay, let's analyze the Wordle board.\nWe know the word length is 8.\n\nFrom the previous guesses, we can infer the following:\n\n*   The word ends in 'D'.\n*   The letter 'E' is present, but not in positions 2, 5, 7\n*   The letter 'A' is present, but not in position 1, 3, 6\n*   The letters B, R, I, G, L, N, C, S, R, H are not present.\n*   'A' is in the 5th position.\n\nBased on these deductions, let's try the word \"FEATHERED\".\n\nAnswer: FEATHERED","Okay, let's analyze the Wordle grid. The word length is 8, and we have 5 attempts remaining.\n\nHere's what we know from the previous guesses:\n\n*   'E' is present in the word, and the last but one letter is 'E'.\n*   'D' is present in the word, and the last letter is 'D'.\n*   'A' is present in the word, and the 6th letter is 'A'.\n*   Letters 'B', 'R', 'I', 'G', 'L', 'N', 'C', 'S', 'R', 'H' are not in the word.\n\nBased on this, let's try the word \"DEARHEAD\".\n\nAnswer: DEADHEAD","Okay, let's analyze the Wordle board.\n\n*   **Word Length:** 8\n*   **Available Attempts:** 4\n*   **Known Correct Letters:** The last letter is D and the 7th letter is E.\n*   **Letters to Use:** A, D, and E\n*   **Letters to Avoid:** B, R, I, G, L, N, C, S, R, H, H.\n\nBased on the information, let's try to eliminate invalid positions for A, D, and E.\n\nFrom the first row, we know that A, D, and E are not at the first, fifth, and seventh positions, respectively.\nFrom the second row, we know that D, E, and A are not at the first, second, and third positions, respectively. Also, the 7th letter is confirmed as E, and the last is confirmed as D.\nFrom the third row, we know that D, E, and A are not at the first, second, and third positions, respectively. The last letter is D, and the 7th letter is confirmed as E.\nFrom the fourth row, we know that D, E, and A are not at the first, second, and fifth positions, respectively. Also, the last letter is D, and the 7th letter is confirmed as E.\nFrom the fifth row, we know that D, E, and A are not at the first, second, and third positions, respectively. The last letter is D.\nFrom the sixth row, we know that D, E, and A are not at the first, second, and third positions, respectively. The last letter is D.\n\nConsidering all of this and focusing on putting the yellow letters into new positions, a reasonable guess would be:\n\n\"DEARHEAD\"\n\nAnswer: DEADHEAD","Okay, I will analyze the Wordle grid to make my next guess.\n\nHere's what I know based on the previous guesses:\n\n*   The word has 8 letters.\n*   The last letter is 'D'.\n*   The seventh letter is 'E'.\n*   'A' is in the fourth position.\n*   'D', 'E', and 'A' are in the word, but their exact positions need to be figured out except that the 7th and 8th positions are 'E' and 'D' respectively and the 4th is 'A'.\n*   'B', 'R', 'I', 'G', 'L', 'N', 'C', 'S', 'R', and 'H' are not in the word.\n\nGiven the information, let's analyze the guesses so far to see if we can find better locations for the known letters and eliminate any other possibilities:\n\n1.  **ABRIDGED:** 'E' and 'D' are correct. 'A' is yellow.\n2.  **DEALERED:** 'E', 'D', 'A' are yellow, so these positions are not where they are.\n3.  **DEADENED:** 'E', 'D', 'A' are yellow, so these positions are not where they are.\n4.  **DECEASED:** 'A' is green, 'E' and 'D' are still yellow, so these positions are not where they are.\n5.  **DEARHEAD:** 'E', 'A', 'D' are yellow, so these positions are not where they are.\n6.  **DEADHEAD:** 'E', 'A', 'D' are yellow, so these positions are not where they are.\n7.  **DEADHEAD:** 'E', 'A', 'D' are yellow, so these positions are not where they are.\n\nI need to find a word with 'A' in the 4th position, 'E' in the 7th and 'D' in the 8th.\nThe letters 'B', 'R', 'I', 'G', 'L', 'N', 'C', 'S', 'H' cannot be in the word.\n'E' and 'D' are not in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, and 6th positions.\n'A' is not in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th or 8th positions.\nThe first three guesses show that 'D' and 'E' can appear more than once in the word.\n\nConsidering these constraints, a possibility would be \"FEEDBACKED\".\n\nAnswer: FEEDBACKED","Okay, let's analyze the Wordle board. The word length is 8. We've had 7 attempts so far.\n\nFrom the grid, we can deduce the following:\n\n*   The 7th position is 'E' (Green).\n*   The 8th position is 'D' (Green).\n*   'A' exists in the word but not in the 1st position.\n*   'D' exists in the word but not in the 1st position.\n*   'E' exists in the word but not in the 2nd position.\n\nLooking at the attempts:\n\n*   \"ABRIDGED\" - 'E' and 'D' are correct at the end, and A is somewhere else\n*   \"DEALERED\" - 'E' and 'D' are correct at the end, and D,E,A are somewhere else\n*   \"DEADENED\" - 'E' and 'D' are correct at the end, and D,E,A are somewhere else\n*   \"DECEASED\" - 'E' and 'D' are correct at the end, 'A' is confirmed in the 5th spot\n*   \"DEARHEAD\" - 'E' and 'D' are correct at the end, and D,E,A are somewhere else\n*   \"DEADHEAD\" - 'E' and 'D' are correct at the end, and D,E,A are somewhere else\n*   \"DEADHEAD\" - 'E' and 'D' are correct at the end, and D,E,A are somewhere else\n\nSo, with A at the 5th, E at the 7th, and D at the 8th, and knowing A,D,E exist but not at the beginning.  Considering these clues, let's try \"BEADWORK\".\n\nAnswer: BEADWORK","Okay, I will analyze the Wordle grid and make the next guess.\n\nBased on the grid, the word length is 8.  We know the 7th letter is E and the 8th letter is D. We also know that A is the 5th letter in the 4th row. Also, based on the grid, the letters B, R, I, G, L, N, C, S, R, H, W, O, R and K are not in the word. Letters D, E, and A are in the word, but not necessarily in the positions they were guessed in previously (except for E and D at the end of the word, and A as the 5th letter).\n\nLet's analyze possible words based on previous guesses.\nFrom the rows, we can try to place the letters D, E, and A in new positions.\n\nConsidering that D, E, A are present and the word ends with ED, and given that there is an A in the 5th spot, we could try a word such as \"DEADHEnD\" - The first 6 rows tried to contain E, A and D and there were repeated letters and the last row suggests W, O, R and K are wrong.\n\nLet's make a guess: \"DEADHEAD\"\nAnswer: DEADHEAD","Okay, I've analyzed the Wordle board.

Also, \"R\" is not in the first or fifth position, and \"I\" is not in the seventh position.\n\nLet's try a word with \"R\" and \"I\" in different positions, and using only letters that haven't been tried: \"BIRRIRING\".\n\nAnswer: BIRRIRING","Okay, let's analyze the current state of the game.\n\n*   **Attempt 1:** `REGARDING` - R, A, N are yellow and E, G, D are gray.\n*   **Attempt 2:** `BIRRRINGG` - B, G are gray, I, R, N are yellow and the 6th R is green.\n\nBased on this, we can deduce the following:\n\n*   The word contains I, R, A and N, but not E, G, D, B.\n*   R is in position 6.\n*   I, R, A, and N are not in the positions they were guessed in.\n*   The word length is 9.\n\nLet's try to place letters based on the information we have.

The sixth letter is 'U'.\n*   Letters 'A', 'B', 'L', 'T', 'Y', 'G', 'I' are not in the word.\n*   The third attempt indicates that the word might end with \"OUSLY\".\n\nLet's try to arrange the letters in a possible solution. \"MONSTROUSLY\" is a possible word.\n\nAnswer: MONSTROUSLY","Okay, let's analyze the Wordle board.\n\nAttempt 1: \"ABSOLUTELY\" - 'S' and 'O' are yellow, 'U' is grey, and 'L' is grey, 'T', 'E' and 'Y' are also grey.\nAttempt 2: \"ENORMOUSLY\" - 'E' is yellow, 'O' is yellow, 'M' and 'O' are green, and 'S' is yellow, 'Y' is grey. 'N', 'R', 'U', 'L' are grey\nAttempt 3: \"GLORIOUSLY\" - 'O' is yellow, 'O' is green, 'U' is grey, 'S' is yellow and 'Y' is grey.\n\nBased on this, we know:\n- The word has two 'O's, in position 5 and 6\n- 'E' is in the word, but not in position 1 or 8.\n- 'S' is in the word, but not in position 3, 8 or 9.\n- 'R' is in the word, but not in position 4.\n- 'N', 'G','L', 'A', 'B', 'T', 'U','M', 'Y' are not in the word.\n\nConsidering the information and focusing on the remaining yellow tiles, let's try the word \"ERRONEOUS\".

We also know that the letters E, R, M, U, and S are present in the word, but not in the locations we previously guessed. Furthermore, A, B, L, T, G, I, and Y are not in the word. N is also likely not in the word.\n\nLooking at the possible letters, let's think of a word that satisfies these constraints. We need E, R, M, U, S in the word. \"COURSERUMS\" or \"REMORSEFUL\"\n\nLet's try \"REMORSEFUL\" as our next guess.\n\nAnswer: REMORSEFUL","Okay, let's analyze the Wordle board.

A, B, S, L, U, T, E, and Y are gray.\n*   **Row 2:** `ENORMOUSLY` - 'E', 'N', 'O', 'R', 'M', 'U', 'S', and 'Y' are yellow. L is gray.\n*   **Row 3:** `GLORIOUSLY` - 'O' is green. G, L, R, I, U, S, and Y are gray.\n*   **Row 4:** `ENORMOUSLY` - 'E', 'N', 'O', 'R', 'M', 'U', 'S', and 'Y' are yellow. L is gray. This is the same as Row 2, redundant.\n*   **Row 5:** `REMORSEFUL` - 'O' is green. 'R', 'E', 'M', 'R', 'S', 'E' are yellow. F, U, L are gray.\n\nFrom this information, we know the 4th letter is 'O'. We also know that the word contains 'E', 'N', 'R', 'M', 'U', 'S', and 'Y'. Also, 'A', 'B', 'G', 'I', 'F', 'L', and 'T' are not in the word.\n\nLet's try to incorporate the yellow letters in different positions. I will avoid using A, B, G, I, F, L, and T.\n\nBased on the available information, let's consider the word: \"MONSTROUSE\"\n\nAnswer: MONSTROUSE","Okay, let's analyze the Wordle board.\n\nHere's what we know from the previous guesses:\n\n*   **Row 1:** A, B, U, T, L, Y are out. S is yellow. O is green.\n*   **Row 2:** N is out. E, R, S, L, Y are yellow. M is green. O is green. U is yellow.\n*   **Row 3:** G, I are out. O, R, U, S, L, Y are yellow.\n*   **Row 4:** E, N, R, S, L, Y are yellow. M is green. O is green. U is yellow.\n*   **Row 5:** R, E, F are out. M is yellow. O is green. S is yellow. U, L are yellow.\n*   **Row 6:** N, T are out. M, O, R, S, U are yellow.

The word length is 10.\n\nHere's a possible guess, considering all the hints:\n\"LOUSIESTOME\"\n\nAnswer: LOUSIESTOME","Okay, I will analyze the Wordle board and make the best guess.\n\nHere's what I know:\n\n*   The word length is 10.\n*   I have 6 attempts remaining.\n*   From the previous guesses:\n\n    *   Row 1: 'A', 'B', 'S', 'O' (green), 'L', 'U', 'T', 'E', 'L', 'Y' have been tried with 'O' in the 4th position.\n    *   Row 2: 'E', 'N', 'O', 'R', 'M'(green), 'O', 'U', 'S', 'L', 'Y' have been tried with 'M' in the 5th position.\n    *   Row 3: 'G', 'L', 'O', 'R', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'S', 'L', 'Y' have been tried\n    *   Row 4: 'E', 'N', 'O', 'R', 'M'(green), 'O', 'U', 'S', 'L', 'Y' have been tried with 'M' in the 5th position.\n    *   Row 5: 'R', 'E', 'M', 'O'(green), 'R', 'S', 'E', 'F', 'U', 'L' have been tried with 'O' in the 4th position.\n    *   Row 6: 'M', 'O', 'N', 'S', 'T', 'R', 'O', 'U', 'S', 'E'(green) have been tried with 'E' in the 10th position.\n\nBased on this information, I know the 4th letter is 'O', the 5th letter is 'M', and the 10th letter is 'E'. I also know that 'A', 'B', 'G', 'I', 'T', 'F', and 'N' are not in the word. From the second and fourth rows, I also know that 'E', 'R', 'U', 'S', 'L', and 'Y' are present, but not in those exact locations. The sixth row rules out that O, M, S, T, R, U and S appear in those location.\n\nNow, let's try to formulate a guess. Since 'E' is confirmed and yellow, I will assume that 'E' cannot be the first letter in this word.\nSince we are sure that 'M' is in the 5th position, 'O' is in the 4th position, and 'E' is in the 10th position, let's formulate a guess that includes 'R', 'U', 'S', 'E', and 'L' letters in a different position.

The word has an \"O\" in the 4th position.\n2.  The word does not have a repeated 'L' or 'Y' in last two positions\n3.  From row 5 and 8, it's likely the word may contain the pattern: 'R E M O R S E'\n\nPossible words that fit this are \"REMORSEFUL\", but it was already guessed. So we look again, we already guessed 'remorseful', from attempt 5 and attempt 8, it gave us grey 'F', 'U' and 'L'.

The 11th letter is \"O\", and the 12th letter is \"N\".\n*   The letters A, N appear multiple times in different positions (yellow).\n*   The letters B, D, M, E, V, S, L, C, U are not in the word.\n\nBased on this, I will make the next guess based on the previous information.\n\nMy guess is: **TRANSLATION**\n\nAnswer: TRANSLATION","Okay, I'll analyze the Wordle board and make a guess.\n\nHere's what I've gathered:\n\n*   The word length is 12.\n*   Letter 'T' is in the 7th position, and it is in correct position.\n*   The letters A, I, O, N, and T are present in the word.\n*   The letters B, D, M, E, V, S, C, U, and L are not present.\n*   From the given grids, a possible guess could be \"INNOVATIONS\".\n\nI will now make the guess \"INNOVATIONS\".\n\nAnswer: INNOVATIONS","Okay, I will analyze the Wordle grid and provide my next guess.\n\nBased on the previous guesses:\n*   'ABANDONMENTS' - The letters A, B, D, N, O, M, E, N, T, S are either incorrect or in the wrong position.\n*   'ELEVATIONSAN' - E, L, V, A, T, I, O, N are present but in some wrong positions, and 'T' is in the correct position.\n*   'TRANSLATIONS' - T, R, A, N, L, I, O, N, S are present but in some wrong positions, and N, S are not present at the end.\n*   'INTERACTIONS' - I, N, T, E, R, A, C, T, I, O, N, S are present but in some wrong positions, and N, S are not present at the end.\n*   'INACTIVATION' - I, N, A, C, T, I, A, T, I, O, N are present but in some wrong positions. 'I' is not at the beginning, or fifth position.\n*   'CONTINUATION' - C, O, N, T, I, N, U, A, T, I, O, N are present but in some wrong positions. 'I' is not at the fifth position.\n*   'ILLUMINATION' - I, L, U, M, I, N, A, T, I, O, N are present but in some wrong positions. 'I' is not at the fifth position.\nWe have:\n- T is in the 6th position.\n- N is at the end.\n- 'A' and 'I' are present.\n\nHere's a potential guess which incorporates these constraints and prioritizes using letters that haven't been tried or whose placement is uncertain.\n\nLet's try the word: \"PROCLAMATION\"\n\nAnswer: PROCLAMATION","Okay, let's analyze the Wordle grid.\n\nFrom the first row, we know A, N, M, E, and S are not in the correct positions, and B and D are not in the word.\n\nThe second row gives us T in the 7th position, and E, L, V, A, I, O, and N are present in the word, but not in those positions.\n\nThe third row tells us that R, A, N, L, T, I, O, and N are in the word, and T, R, A, N, S, L, and S are not in the correct positions.\n\nThe fourth row confirms I, N, T, E, R, A, C, T, I, O, and N are in the word, but not in those positions.\n\nThe fifth row tells us that I, N, A, C, T, I, O, and N are in the word, and not in those positions. V is not in the word.\n\nThe sixth row tells us that C, O, N, T, I, A, T, I, O, and N are in the word, but not in those positions, and U is not in the word.\n\nThe seventh row tells us that I, L, A, T, I, O, and N are in the word, but not in those positions, and U, M are not in the word.\n\nThe eighth row tells us that A, T, I, O, and N are in the word, but not in those positions, and P, R, C, L, M are not in the word.\n\nBased on this, we can deduce that the word probably contains TION at the end.\nThe letters A, I, O, N, R, C, E and T are likely to be in the word, probably several times. We also have the constraint that the 7th letter is T.\n\nGiven the letters available and the constraints, I'll make a guess:\n\n\"RECITATION\"\n\nAnswer: RECITATIONS","Okay, I will analyze the Wordle board and make an educated guess.\n\nBased on the board:\n\n*   The word length is 12.\n*   The letter 'T' is in the 7th position (green).\n*   Letters A, N, I, O are present in the word, but not in the positions they were guessed in rows 1-7.\n*   Letters B, D, M, E, V, S, R, L, C, U, P are not in the word.\n\nLooking at the pattern, and considering the available letters, and that \"ATIONS\" is a common ending, the yellow letters T, R, A, N suggest a possible starting sequence of \"TRANS\". Given that the 'I' is present and that 'T' is in the 7th position, the word might be \"TRANSLATION\". Let's check the previous incorrect guesses. The letters E, S, R, L, C, U and P have been ruled out.\n\nI'll go with TRANSLATION.\n\nAnswer: TRANSLATION","Okay, I will analyze the Wordle board and make my next guess.\n\nFrom the previous guesses, we know the following:\n\n*   The word ends in \"ATION\"\n*   The letters T, R, A, I, O, and N are in the word\n*   The letters B, D, M, E, V, S, C, U, P, L are not in the word\n*   From TRANSLATION, we know T, A are in the wrong positions\n*   From INTERACTION, we know R is in the wrong position\n*   From CONTINUATION, we know O, N are in the wrong positions.\n\nBased on this, I can try to make a valid guess with all of the known information.\n\nMy next guess is: **RETAINATION**\n\nAnswer: RETAINATION","Okay, let's analyze the Wordle board.\n\nWe are looking for a 12-letter word. The 6th letter is 'T' and the 11th letter is 'I'. We have the letters 'A', 'N', 'O' present in the word, and 'B', 'D', 'M', 'E', 'L', 'V', 'S', 'R', 'C', 'U', 'P' are not present. Looking at the guesses, we can derive a possible pattern. It seems like \"NATIONS\" is at the end of the word. So the word is XXXXXXTIONNS.\nLooking at the board, \"Illumination\" is possible.\n\nAnswer: ILLUMINATION","Okay, let's analyze the Wordle board.\n\nFrom the previous guesses, we know the following:\n- 'T', 'R', 'A', 'N', 'I', 'O' are present in the word.\n- 'I' is in the 7th position.\n- 'B', 'D', 'M', 'E', 'V', 'S', 'C', 'U', 'P', 'L' are not in the word\n\nConsidering the available information, the word could be something like \"TRANSLATION\", \"INTERACTION\", \"CONTINUATION\", \"ILLUMINATION\", \"PROCLAMATION\". Let's try \"CONFIRMATION\"\n\nAnswer: CONFIRMATION"],"have_image":true}
