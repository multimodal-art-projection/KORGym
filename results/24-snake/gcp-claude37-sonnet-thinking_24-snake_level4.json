The snake can either continue moving UP or turn LEFT or RIGHT. Since the snake can't reverse direction directly, it can't move DOWN.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n1. UP: The snake will move to the 4th row and 3rd column, which is an empty space. This doesn't lead to any immediate apple, but it's a safe move.\n2. LEFT: The snake will move to the 5th row and 2nd column, which is an empty space. It doesn't lead to any immediate apple, but it's a safe move.\n3. RIGHT: The snake will move to the 5th row and 4th column, which is an empty space. It doesn't lead to any immediate apple, but it's a safe move.\n\nSince none of these moves lead to an immediate apple, I need to consider which direction might be better for reaching the nearest apple.\n\nIf I go UP, I'll be closer to the apple at (2, 2) and might be able to reach it in a few moves.\nIf I go LEFT, I'll be closer to the apple at (6, 2).\nIf I go RIGHT, I'll be closer to the apple at (3, 7).\n\nLooking at the distances:\n- From (4, 3) to (2, 2): |4-2| + |3-2| = 2 + 1 = 3 steps\n- From (5, 2) to (6, 2): |5-6| + |2-2| = 1 + 0 = 1 steps\n- From (5, 4) to (3, 7): |5-3| + |4-7| = 2 + 3 = 5 steps\n\nBased on the distances, going LEFT seems like the best option as it allows the snake to reach the apple at (6, 2) in just one more move.\n\nSo, my answer is: LEFT.\n\nWait, I need to reconsider. The current direction is UP, which means the snake is moving from (5, 3) to (4, 3). From (4, 3), the distances to the apples are:\n- From (4, 3) to (2, 2): |4-2| + |3-2| = 2 + 1 = 3 steps\n- From (4, 3) to (3, 7): |4-3| + |3-7| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps\n- From (4, 3) to (6, 2): |4-6| + |3-2| = 2 + 1 = 3 steps\n\nGiven these distances, going UP and then LEFT to reach the apple at (2, 2) or going DOWN (if possible in the future) and then LEFT to reach the apple at (6, 2) seem like good strategies. But for the immediate move, I'll choose UP to get closer to the apple at (2, 2).\n\nActually, let me recheck my distances. I think I'm making some mistakes in my calculations.\n\nThe head is at (5, 3) (5th row, 3rd column).\n\n- Apple 1 at (2, 2) (2nd row, 2nd column): |5-2| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps\n- Apple 2 at (3, 7) (3rd row, 7th column): |5-3| + |3-7| = 2 + 4 = 6 steps\n- Apple 3 at (6, 2) (6th row, 2nd column): |5-6| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2 steps\n\nBased on these distances, the closest apple is at (6, 2), which would require going DOWN and then LEFT. However, since the current direction is UP, I can't immediately go DOWN (as that would be a reversal). \n\nLet's reconsider the immediate moves:\n\n1. UP: Moving to (4, 3)\n   - Distance to Apple 1: |4-2| + |3-2| = 2 + 1 = 3 steps\n   - Distance to Apple 2: |4-3| + |3-7| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps\n   - Distance to Apple 3: |4-6| + |3-2| = 2 + 1 = 3 steps\n\n2. LEFT: Moving to (5, 2)\n   - Distance to Apple 1: |5-2| + |2-2| = 3 + 0 = 3 steps\n   - Distance to Apple 2: |5-3| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7 steps\n   - Distance to Apple 3: |5-6| + |2-2| = 1 + 0 = 1 steps\n\n3. RIGHT: Moving to (5, 4)\n   - Distance to Apple 1: |5-2| + |4-2| = 3 + 2 = 5 steps\n   - Distance to Apple 2: |5-3| + |4-7| = 2 + 3 = 5 steps\n   - Distance to Apple 3: |5-6| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3 steps\n\nBased on these calculations, moving LEFT seems like the best option as it gets the snake closer to Apple 3 (the closest apple). From (5, 2), the snake could go DOWN in the next move to eat Apple 3.\n\nWait, let me reread the problem. I think I'm indexing the board incorrectly. Let's be more clear.\n\nLet's index the board with (row, column) starting from the top-left corner as (1, 1).\n\n```\n########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nSo, the snake's head (H) is at position (5, 3).\nThe apples (A) are at positions (2, 2), (3, 7), and (6, 2).\n\nThe current direction is UP, so the snake is moving from (5, 3) to (4, 3).\n\nLet's recalculate the distances from each potential next position:\n\n1. UP: Moving to (4, 3)\n   - Distance to Apple 1 (2, 2): |4-2| + |3-2| = 2 + 1 = 3 steps\n   - Distance to Apple 2 (3, 7): |4-3| + |3-7| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps\n   - Distance to Apple 3 (6, 2): |4-6| + |3-2| = 2 + 1 = 3 steps\n\n2. LEFT: Moving to (5, 2)\n   - Distance to Apple 1 (2, 2): |5-2| + |2-2| = 3 + 0 = 3 steps\n   - Distance to Apple 2 (3, 7): |5-3| + |2-7| = 2 + 5 = 7 steps\n   - Distance to Apple 3 (6, 2): |5-6| + |2-2| = 1 + 0 = 1 steps\n\n3. RIGHT: Moving to (5, 4)\n   - Distance to Apple 1 (2, 2): |5-2| + |4-2| = 3 + 2 = 5 steps\n   - Distance to Apple 2 (3, 7): |5-3| + |4-7| = 2 + 3 = 5 steps\n   - Distance to Apple 3 (6, 2): |5-6| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3 steps\n\nBased on these calculations, moving LEFT seems like the best option as it gets the snake closer to Apple 3 (the closest apple). After moving LEFT, the snake can go DOWN in the next move to eat Apple 3.\n\nSo, my final answer is: LEFT.Game board:\n```\n########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nI'll analyze the current game board and determine the best move.\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (5, 3) and is currently moving UP.\n\nLooking at the available options:\n- If I continue moving UP, I'll get closer to the apple at the top-left.\n- If I turn LEFT, I'll move toward the apple on the left side.\n- If I turn RIGHT, I'll move away from the nearest apples.\n\nBased on the current position and the nearest apples, I'll choose to move LEFT. This will position me closer to the apple at position (6, 2), which I can then reach by moving DOWN in the next turn.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","HTTPError 529: {\"error\":{\"message\":\"-4316: Overloaded\",\"code\":\"-4307\"}}"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point.

I have four options: LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN.\n\nSince the snake is currently moving UP, I can't choose DOWN (as the problem states the snake can't reverse its direction).\n\nLet's check each valid direction:\n\n1. UP: If I move UP, the snake head will go to position (3, 2). Looking at the board, that position has an apple (A), so I'll eat an apple and grow. This seems like a good move.\n\n2. LEFT: If I move LEFT, the snake head will go to position (4, 1). This position is empty, so it's a valid move, but I won't eat an apple.\n\n3. RIGHT: If I move RIGHT, the snake head will go to position (4, 3). This position is empty, so it's a valid move, but I won't eat an apple.\n\nSince moving UP will let me eat an apple, I'll choose that direction.\n\nMy answer is \"UP\".Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# AA   #\n#  H   #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nI need to decide the best direction to move the snake. The snake head (H) is currently at position (4,2) and moving UP.\n\nLooking at my options:\n- Moving UP would take me to (3,2) where there's an apple (A), allowing me to eat it and grow\n- Moving LEFT would take me to (4,1) which is empty\n- Moving RIGHT would take me to (4,3) which is empty\n- Moving DOWN is not valid since I can't reverse direction\n\nThe optimal choice is to continue moving UP to eat the apple. This will increase my score by 1.\n\nAnswer: UP","Let me understand the current game state:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# AH   #\n#  S   #\n#  AA  #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\n- The snake's head 'H' is at the position (3, 3) (row, column, 0-indexed)\n- There's a segment of the snake's body 'S' at position (4, 2)\n- There are apples 'A' at positions (3, 1), (5, 2), and (5, 3)\n- The current direction is UP, which means the snake is moving upward\n- We are at epoch 2\n\nThe rules state that:\n1. The snake cannot reverse its direction\n2. The snake loses if it collides with itself or walls\n3. The snake grows by one segment when it eats an apple\n\nNow, let's determine the valid moves:\n- UP: The snake will move to position (2, 3), which is an empty space. This is valid.\n- LEFT: The snake will move to position (3, 2), which has an apple 'A'. This is valid and will grow the snake.\n- RIGHT: The snake will move to position (3, 4), which is an empty space. This is valid.\n- DOWN: The snake will move to position (4, 3), which is an empty space, but this would be a reverse of the current direction (UP), so it's invalid.\n\nLet's analyze our options:\n1. If we go UP: The snake will move to an empty space. No immediate benefit.\n2. If we go LEFT: The snake will eat an apple, grow by one segment, and increase the score.\n3. If we go RIGHT: The snake will move to an empty space. No immediate benefit.\n\nBased on the goal of eating as many apples as possible, the best move seems to be LEFT because it will allow the snake to eat an apple.\n\nSo, my decision is to move LEFT.\n\nBut I think I need to recheck this. Let's carefully look at the game board again:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# AH   #\n#  S   #\n#  AA  #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nI made a mistake. Let me correct:\n- The snake's head 'H' is at position (3, 3)\n- There's a segment of the snake's body 'S' at position (4, 2)\n- There are apples 'A' at positions (3, 1), (5, 2), and (5, 3)\n\nLet's redo the analysis:\n- UP: The snake will move to position (2, 3), which is an empty space. This is valid.\n- LEFT: The snake will move to position (3, 2), which is an empty space. This is valid.\n- RIGHT: The snake will move to position (3, 4), which is an empty space. This is valid.\n- DOWN: The snake will move to position (4, 3), which is an empty space, but this would be a reverse of the current direction (UP), so it's invalid.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused with the board representation. Let me verify with the provided example:\n\nExample board:\n```\n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nAnd if the direction is DOWN, the next state is:\n```\n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nSo in this example:\n- The head 'H' moved down\n- A new segment 'S' appeared where the head was previously\n- An apple 'A' was eaten\n\nNow, let's reinterpret our game board:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# AH   #\n#  S   #\n#  AA  #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\n- The head 'H' is at position (3, 3)\n- There's a segment of the snake's body 'S' at position (4, 2)\n- There are apples 'A' at positions (3, 1), (5, 2), and (5, 3)\n\nActually, I think there's only one apple at position (3, 1). Let me look again:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# AH   #\n#  S   #\n#  AA  #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nI think I was using 0-indexing when the game board is more intuitively looked at with 1-indexing. Let's try again:\n\nRow 1: ########\nRow 2: #      #\nRow 3: #      #\nRow 4: # AH   #\nRow 5: #  S   #\nRow 6: #  AA  #\nRow 7: #      #\nRow 8: ########\n\nSo:\n- The head 'H' is at position (4, 3)\n- There's a segment of the snake's body 'S' at position (5, 3)\n- There are apples 'A' at positions (4, 2), (6, 3), and (6, 4)\n\nBut this doesn't quite match up with the example. Let me recheck the board representation again:\n\nLet's consider each character as a position on the board, with (row, column) coordinates, where the top-left is (1, 1):\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# AH   #\n#  S   #\n#  AA  #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\n- Row 1, Column 1-8: #, #, #, #, #, #, #, #\n- Row 2, Column 1-8: #, space, space, space, space, space, space, #\n- Row 3, Column 1-8: #, space, space, space, space, space, space, #\n- Row 4, Column 1-8: #, space, A, H, space, space, space, #\n- Row 5, Column 1-8: #, space, space, S, space, space, space, #\n- Row 6, Column 1-8: #, space, space, A, A, space, space, #\n- Row 7, Column 1-8: #, space, space, space, space, space, space, #\n- Row 8, Column 1-8: #, #, #, #, #, #, #, #\n\nSo:\n- The head 'H' is at position (4, 3)\n- There's a segment of the snake's body 'S' at position (5, 3)\n- There are apples 'A' at positions (4, 2), (6, 3), and (6, 4)\n\nWait, I'm still confused because in the example:\n\n```\n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at row 3, and the snake segment 'S' is at row 2. This suggests that the snake is moving upward (since the segment is above the head).\n\nBut in our current game board:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# AH   #\n#  S   #\n#  AA  #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at row 4, and the snake segment 'S' is at row 5. This suggests that the snake is moving downward (since the segment is below the head).\n\nBut the current direction is given as UP. This seems contradictory.\n\nLet me try to reason this again. If the current direction is UP, and the snake's head is at position (4, 3), then the next position would be (3, 3). But there's no apple at that position, so the snake won't eat anything.\n\nLet's consider the four possible directions and see what happens:\n- UP: The snake will move to position (3, 3), which is an empty space. No immediate benefit.\n- LEFT: The snake will move to position (4, 2), which has an apple 'A'. This would let the snake eat the apple and grow.\n- RIGHT: The snake will move to position (4, 4), which is an empty space. No immediate benefit.\n- DOWN: This would be a reverse of the current direction (UP), which is invalid according to the rules.\n\nUpon closer inspection, I realize that I was right. If the current direction is UP, then the segment should be BELOW the head (since the snake is moving upward, the segment represents where the head was in the previous step). So, our current game board is consistent.\n\nNow, based on the goal of eating as many apples as possible, the best move would be LEFT because it will allow the snake to eat an apple.\n\nSo, my decision is to move LEFT.\n\nActually, let me revisit the rule that the snake cannot reverse its direction. The rule says:\n\"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\"\n\nThis means:\n- If the current direction is UP, the snake cannot turn to DOWN directly.\n- If the current direction is LEFT, the snake cannot turn to RIGHT directly.\n- If the current direction is RIGHT, the snake cannot turn to LEFT directly.\n- If the current direction is DOWN, the snake cannot turn to UP directly.\n\nSince the current direction is UP, and we're considering turning LEFT, this is not a reverse direction, so it's valid.\n\nSo, my decision is still to move LEFT because it will allow the snake to eat an apple and it's a valid move.\n\nLet me quickly recheck the board one more time:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# AH   #\n#  S   #\n#  AA  #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nYep, there's an apple at position (4, 2), which is to the left of the snake's head. Moving LEFT will let the snake eat this apple, so that's the best move.\n\nActually I'm still concerned about the direction. Let me trace through the example again to make sure I understand the board representation:\n\nExample board:\n```\n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nAnd if the direction is DOWN, the next state is:\n```\n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nIn the example, the head 'H' starts at row 3 and the segment 'S' is at row 2. When the snake moves DOWN, the head 'H' moves to row 4, a new segment 'S' appears at row 3 (where the head was previously), and the original segment 'S' at row 2 remains.\n\nSo, if the snake moves in a certain direction, a new segment appears where the head was.\n\nGiven this understanding, let's map out the current game board:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# AH   #\n#  S   #\n#  AA  #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\n- The head 'H' is at position (4, 3).\n- There's a segment 'S' at position (5, 3), which suggests that the snake just moved UP from position (5, 3) to (4, 3).\n- There are apples 'A' at positions (4, 2), (6, 3), and (6, 4).\n\nNow, if the current direction is UP, the snake's next move (if we continue going UP) would take it to position (3, 3), which is an empty space.\n\nThe best move, considering the goal of eating apples, would be LEFT, which would take the snake to position (4, 2) and allow it to eat an apple.\n\nHowever, actually, looking at the current direction as UP and the position of the snake's body 'S' at (5, 3), it suggests that the snake just moved UP from (5, 3) to (4, 3). So our consideration that LEFT is the best move because it will allow the snake to eat an apple at position (4, 2) is correct.\n\nI'm convinced that LEFT is the best move.\n\nWait one more second. Let me actually trace the movement once more just to be double sure.\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# AH   #\n#  S   #\n#  AA  #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nGiven the current board, if the snake is moving LEFT:\n\nThe head 'H' would move from (4, 3) to (4, 2), which has an apple 'A'. The snake would eat this apple, grow by one segment, and the score would increase by 1.\n\nThe new segment 'S' would appear at the previous position of the head, which is (4, 3).\n\nThe existing segment 'S' at position (5, 3) would remain since the snake grew.\n\nThe resulting board would look like:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#HS    #\n#  S   #\n#  AA  #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nThis seems right. Moving LEFT will let the snake eat an apple and grow, so it's the best move.\n\nSo, my decision is to move LEFT because it will allow the snake to eat an apple and it's a valid move.\n\nLooking back at the BOARD:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# AH   #\n#  S   #\n#  AA  #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nAnd the current direction is UP.\n\nLet me trace again:\n\nUp would go from (4, 3) to (3, 3), which is an empty space.\nLEFT would go from (4, 3) to (4, 2), which has an apple 'A'. This allows the snake to eat the apple.\nRIGHT would go from (4, 3) to (4, 4), which is an empty space.\nDOWN would reverse the current direction (UP), which is invalid.\n\nMoving LEFT is the best choice.\n\nWait, I think I got my coordinates mixed up again. Let's be precise:\n\nThe board is an 8x8 grid:\n- Rows are numbered 1 to 8 from top to bottom.\n- Columns are numbered 1 to 8 from left to right.\n\nGiven this, the positions are:\n- Head 'H' is at position (Row 4, Column 3).\n- Snake segment 'S' is at position (Row 5, Column 3).\n- Apples 'A' are at positions (Row 4, Column 2), (Row 6, Column 3), and (Row 6, Column 4).\n\nThe current direction is UP.\n\nIf the snake moves UP, it goes from (Row 4, Column 3) to (Row 3, Column 3), which is an empty space.\nIf the snake moves LEFT, it goes from (Row 4, Column 3) to (Row 4, Column 2), which has an apple 'A'. This allows the snake to eat the apple.\nIf the snake moves RIGHT, it goes from (Row 4, Column 3) to (Row 4, Column 4), which is an empty space.\nIf the snake moves DOWN, it would reverse the current direction (UP), which is invalid.\n\nGiven the goal of eating as many apples as possible, the best move is LEFT, which allows the snake to eat an apple at position (Row 4, Column 2).\n\nI'm not sure why I kept wavering on this. Moving LEFT is my final decision.\n\nActually, one more thing. If the snake's head is at (4, 3) and there's a segment at (5, 3), then the snake is already positioned like it's moving upward (since the segment is below the head). The current direction being UP is consistent with this.\n\nAlright, I'm confident in my decision to move LEFT.\n\nLet me go back and double-check:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# AH   #\n#  S   #\n#  AA  #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\n- The head 'H' is at (4, 3).\n- There's a segment 'S' at (5, 3).\n- There are apples 'A' at (4, 2), (6, 3), and (6, 4).\n- The current direction is UP.\n\nThe best move is LEFT because it will allow the snake to eat an apple at (4, 2).\n\nSo, my decision is to move LEFT.Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# AH   #\n#  S   #\n#  AA  #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nI need to decide the best direction for the snake to move. Let me analyze the current state:\n\n1. The snake's head 'H' is at row 4, column 3\n2. There's a body segment 'S' at row 5, column 3 (below the head)\n3. The snake is currently moving UP\n4. There are three apples: one at row 4, column 2 (left of the head), and two more at row 6, columns 3 and 4\n\nMy options:\n- UP: Move to (row 3, column 3) - empty space\n- LEFT: Move to (row 4, column 2) - apple\n- RIGHT: Move to (row 4, column 4) - empty space\n- DOWN: Invalid because it's the reverse of current direction (UP)\n\nThe optimal choice is to turn LEFT, which will allow me to eat the apple immediately. This will increase my score by 1 and grow the snake by one segment.\n\nAfter moving LEFT, the board would look like:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#HS    #\n#  S   #\n#  AA  #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nAnswer: LEFT","HTTPError 529: {\"error\":{\"message\":\"-4316: Overloaded\",\"code\":\"-4307\"}}"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Let me understand the current state:\n\n- The game board is 8x8 with walls (#) around the edges.\n- The snake's head (H) is at position (4, 3) (counting from top-left as (0, 0)).\n- There are 3 apples (A) on the board:\n  - One at position (3, 4)\n  - One at position (6, 3)\n  - One at position (6, 5)\n- The snake is currently moving UP, which means if I don't change direction, it will move one square upwards.\n- The current epoch is 1.\n\nNow, I need to decide which direction to control the snake next.\n\nSince the snake is currently moving UP, and it can't reverse direction directly (i.e., it can't go DOWN now), I can choose to move LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n1. UP: If I continue moving UP, the snake will move to position (3, 3). There's no apple there, so the snake won't grow, and there's no risk of collision.\n2. LEFT: If I move LEFT, the snake will go to position (4, 2). There's also no apple there.\n3. RIGHT: If I move RIGHT, the snake will go to position (4, 4). There's also no apple there.\n\nThe closest apple is at position (3, 4). To get there, I should first go UP to position (3, 3), and then go RIGHT to position (3, 4). \n\nSo, my decision is to move UP. This will bring me one step closer to the apple at position (3, 4).\n\nWait, I need to be careful about the coordinate system here. Let me think about the board again, with (0, 0) being the top-left corner.\n\nThe board is:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n```\n\nIf we number the grid cells from 0 to 7 (excluding the walls), we have:\n\n```\n  0123456\n0 ########\n1 #      #\n2 #   A  #\n3 #      #\n4 #  H   #\n5 #      #\n6 #  A A #\n7 ########\n```\n\nSo the head (H) is at position (4, 3). If the snake moves UP, it will go to (3, 3). There's no apple there, but it's a step closer to the apple at (2, 4).\n\nActually, let me be even more explicit and count the walls as part of the grid:\n\n```\n  01234567\n0 ########\n1 #      #\n2 #   A  #\n3 #      #\n4 #  H   #\n5 #      #\n6 #  A A #\n7 ########\n```\n\nSo, the head (H) is at position (4, 3), and the apples (A) are at positions (2, 4), (6, 2), and (6, 5).\n\nIf the snake moves UP, it will go to (3, 3). There's no apple there. But if I go UP again, I'll reach (2, 3), and then I can go RIGHT to (2, 4) where there's an apple.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm interpreting the directions correctly. From the position (4, 3), if the snake moves UP, it should go to (3, 3) (one row up, same column). If it moves RIGHT, it should go to (4, 4) (same row, one column to the right). If it moves LEFT, it should go to (4, 2) (same row, one column to the left).\n\nI'm currently at (4, 3), and there's an apple at (2, 4). To get there, I need to go UP twice (to reach (2, 3)) and then RIGHT once (to reach (2, 4)). So, it makes sense for me to move UP first.\n\nLet's check the other apples and see if there's a shorter path:\n- Apple at (2, 4): UP, UP, RIGHT from (4, 3). Distance: 3 moves.\n- Apple at (6, 2): DOWN, DOWN, LEFT from (4, 3). Distance: 3 moves.\n- Apple at (6, 5): DOWN, DOWN, RIGHT, RIGHT from (4, 3). Distance: 4 moves.\n\nThe closest apple is the one at (2, 4) or (6, 2), both requiring 3 moves. Since the snake is currently moving UP, it makes more sense to go for the apple at (2, 4) to avoid changing direction and potentially backtracking.\n\nBut again, I think I'm making some errors here. Let me rethink the problem. \n\nThe board is:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n```\n\nI think I misunderstood. Let's read the grid more simply.\nLine 0: ########\nLine 1: #      #\nLine 2: #   A  #\nLine 3: #      #\nLine 4: #  H   #\nLine 5: #      #\nLine 6: #  A A #\nLine 7: ########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is on line 4 at the 3rd position (1-indexed within the inner grid, ignoring the walls). So, the coordinates would be (4, 3) in a 0-indexed system where (0, 0) is the top-left corner (including the walls).\n\nThe apples (A) are at:\n- (2, 4) in the 0-indexed system.\n- (6, 3) in the 0-indexed system.\n- (6, 5) in the 0-indexed system.\n\nI think I got confused because I thought of the first number as the row (i.e., the \"y\" coordinate), but you're right, for standard grid systems, the first number is the row (or \"y\") and the second is the column (or \"x\").\n\nSo, from the head position (4, 3), the nearest apple is at (2, 4). To get there, we need to go UP twice (to reach (2, 3)) and then RIGHT once (to reach (2, 4)).\n\nSince the current direction is UP, it makes sense to continue UP to get closer to the apple at (2, 4).\n\nSo, my answer is UP.\n\nActually, I think I might be still confused about the numbering.  Let's be more explicit:\n\n```\n 01234567\n0########\n1#      #\n2#   A  #\n3#      #\n4#  H   #\n5#      #\n6#  A A #\n7########\n```\n\nSo the head (H) is at row=4, col=3 in a 0-indexed grid where (0, 0) is the top-left corner (including the walls).\n\nThe apples (A) are at:\n- row=2, col=4\n- row=6, col=3\n- row=6, col=5\n\nFrom the current position (4, 3), if I move UP, I'll go to (3, 3). There's no apple there, but it's a step closer to the apple at (2, 4).\n\nSince the current direction is UP, and I want to eventually reach the apple at (2, 4), I'll continue moving UP.\n\nTherefore, my decision is to move UP, which I believe is my final answer.\n\nActually, let's double check. The way the board is drawn:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n```\n\nThe head (H) is at the 5th row (counting from 1 and including the wall) and the 4th column. But if I count from 0 and include the wall:\n\n```\nrow 0: ########\nrow 1: #      #\nrow 2: #   A  #\nrow 3: #      #\nrow 4: #  H   #\nrow 5: #      #\nrow 6: #  A A #\nrow 7: ########\n```\n\nYes, the head (H) is at (4, 3), and the apples (A) are at (2, 4), (6, 3), and (6, 5).\n\nNow, if I move the snake UP from (4, 3), it will go to (3, 3). If I continue moving UP, it will reach (2, 3), which is adjacent to the apple at (2, 4). Then, I can go RIGHT to eat the apple. But first, I'll move UP.\n\n**Final Decision**: Move the snake UP.Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nLooking at the game board, I can see the snake's head (H) is currently positioned in the middle of the board, and there are three apples (A) on the board:\n- One apple is two spaces above and one space to the right of the head\n- Two apples are at the bottom row\n\nSince the snake is currently moving UP and I want to reach the closest apple, I'll continue moving UP. This will move the snake one square closer to the upper apple. After this move, I'll be one space away from the apple, and on the next turn, I can move RIGHT to eat it.\n\nMoving DOWN would be invalid since it's the opposite of my current direction. Moving LEFT or RIGHT would take me away from the closest apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","Let me analyze the current game state and decide on the next move.\n\nFirst, here's the current game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n```\n\nIn this board, I see:\n- The snake's head 'H' is in the middle of the 4th row\n- There's an apple 'A' above the snake in the 3rd row\n- There are two more apples 'A' in the bottom row\n\nThe current direction is UP, which means the snake is moving upward.\n\nThe goal is to eat as many apples as possible without colliding with the walls or itself. Since the snake is currently moving UP and there's an apple directly above it, the logical choice would be to continue moving UP to eat that apple.\n\nLet's consider the options:\n1. UP: This will move the snake toward the apple above it\n2. LEFT: This would move the snake to the left, away from the nearest apple\n3. RIGHT: This would move the snake to the right, away from the nearest apple\n4. DOWN: This would be a 180-degree turn from UP, which is not allowed according to the rules\n\nSince I want to eat the apple above the snake and continue growing, and the snake is already moving UP, I should choose the UP direction.\n\nUP seems like the obvious choice here because:\n1. It continues in the current direction\n2. It leads directly to an apple\n3. It doesn't risk collision with walls or the snake itself\n4. It will increase the score\n\nSo my answer is UP.Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n```\n\nI need to decide where to move the snake next. Looking at the current state:\n\n- The snake's head (H) is in the middle of the board (row 4)\n- The snake is currently moving UP\n- There's an apple (A) directly above the snake's head in row 3\n- There are two more apples at the bottom of the board (row 7)\n\nSince the snake is already moving UP and there's an apple directly in that path, the best move is to continue moving UP. This will allow the snake to eat the apple and grow in length.\n\nThe other options would move away from the closest food source:\n- LEFT or RIGHT would move away from the apple above\n- DOWN would be an illegal move since it's a direct reversal of the current UP direction\n\nBy moving UP, I'll immediately eat an apple and increase the score.\n\nAnswer: UP","HTTPError 529: {\"error\":{\"message\":\"-4316: Overloaded\",\"code\":\"-4307\"}}"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Let me understand the current state of the game:\n\n1. The board is 8x8, with walls '#' around the edges.\n2. The snake's head 'H' is currently at the position (5th row, 3rd column) (counting from 1).\n3. There are three apples 'A' on the board: one is directly to the left of the snake's head (5th row, 2nd column), and the other two are in the 3rd row, at the 3rd and 6th columns.\n4. The snake has a length of 1 (just the head, no body segments 'S' visible yet).\n5. The current direction is UP, so the snake is moving upwards.\n\nNow, I need to decide the next direction for the snake. The snake cannot reverse its direction. Since the current direction is UP, the snake cannot go DOWN directly.\n\nOptions:\n- UP: Continue moving upwards. This would move the snake from (5th row, 3rd column) to (4th row, 3rd column). There's no apple at that position, but it keeps the snake away from the walls.\n- LEFT: Turn the snake left. This would move the snake from (5th row, 3rd column) to (5th row, 2nd column). There's an apple at that position, so the snake would eat it and grow in length.\n- RIGHT: Turn the snake right. This would move the snake from (5th row, 3rd column) to (5th row, 4th column). There's no apple at that position.\n\nSince one of the goals is to eat as many apples as possible, and there's an apple directly to the left of the snake's head, I'll choose LEFT as the next direction.\n\nMy answer: LEFTGame board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n# AH   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nLooking at the current game board, I need to decide the best move for the snake. The snake's head 'H' is currently in the middle of the board (5th row, 3rd column), and there's an apple 'A' immediately to the left of the head. There are also two other apples on the board - one in the 3rd row, 3rd column, and another in the 3rd row, 6th column.\n\nSince the current direction is UP, I have three possible moves: continue moving UP, turn LEFT, or turn RIGHT. I cannot move DOWN as that would be reversing direction.\n\nIf I move LEFT, I will immediately eat the apple that's adjacent to the snake's head, increasing my score and growing the snake. This seems like the optimal choice as it gives an immediate reward.\n\nMoving UP or RIGHT doesn't provide an immediate benefit, though UP would bring me closer to another apple.\n\nI choose to move LEFT to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Let's analyze the current game situation:\n\n1. The game board is 8x8, with walls ('#') surrounding the edges.\n2. The snake's head ('H') is currently at row 5, column 3.\n3. The snake's body ('S') is at row 5, column 4, meaning the snake has a length of 2.\n4. There are three apples ('A'): one at row 3, column 4; one at row 3, column 7; and one at row 6, column 3.\n5. The current direction is LEFT, meaning the snake is moving to the left.\n\nTo determine the best move, I need to consider several factors:\n- I need to avoid collision with walls and the snake's own body.\n- I want to move towards the apples to increase the score.\n- I need to ensure my move is valid (not reversing direction from LEFT to RIGHT).\n\nSince the current direction is LEFT, the valid directions I can choose are: UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n1. LEFT: If I continue moving left, the head will move to position (5, 2). This is where there's an apple ('A'), so I would eat it and increase the score. This seems like a good move.\n\n2. UP: If I move up, the head will move to position (4, 3). There's no immediate benefit (no apple there), and I'm moving away from the apple at position (5, 2).\n\n3. DOWN: If I move down, the head will move to position (6, 3). Again, there's no immediate benefit.\n\nGiven these considerations, moving LEFT is the best choice because it allows me to eat an apple immediately.\n\nTo visualize the result after moving LEFT:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n# SH   #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nWait, there's an issue with my visualization. After eating the apple, the snake should grow in length. The correct visualization would be:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n# HS   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nBut I realize my visualization might not be correct because the movement would be:\n- The head would move to (5, 2) and eat the apple.\n- The current head at (5, 3) would become a body segment.\n- The tail would also move forward, but since the snake ate an apple, it would grow, so the tail would remain at its current position.\n\nLet's do a more careful step-by-step:\n\n1. Current state:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n# HS   #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\n2. If I move LEFT, the head would be at (5, 2), where there's an apple. The apple would be eaten, and the snake would grow in length:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n#HS    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nActually, I think the issue is with how I'm visualizing the board. Let me break down the board correctly:\n\nThe board is represented as:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n# HS   #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nHere, rows and columns start at the top-left corner. So, if we number them (0-based):\n- The head ('H') is at position (4, 2).\n- The body segment ('S') is at position (4, 3).\n- The apples ('A') are at positions (2, 3), (2, 6), and (5, 2).\n\nThe snake's current direction is LEFT. If I continue moving LEFT, the head would move to position (4, 1). There's no apple there, but it's a valid move.\n\nIf I move UP, the head would move to position (3, 2). There's no apple there either.\n\nIf I move DOWN, the head would move to position (5, 2), where there's an apple. This would be a good move to eat the apple.\n\nSo, it seems like moving DOWN is the best choice to eat the apple at position (5, 2).\n\nLet me double-check one more time by visualizing the board differently, using a grid-like representation to make sure I have the rows and columns right:\n\n```\n   01234567\n0  ########\n1  #      #\n2  #  A  A#\n3  #      #\n4  # HS   #\n5  # A    #\n6  #      #\n7  ########\n```\n\nNow, I can see more clearly:\n- The head ('H') is at position (4, 2).\n- The body segment ('S') is at position (4, 3).\n- The apples ('A') are at positions (2, 3), (2, 6), and (5, 2).\n\nIf the current direction is LEFT, the snake would naturally move to position (4, 1). If I choose to move DOWN, the head would go to position (5, 2), where there's an apple.\n\nSo, moving DOWN is the best choice to eat the apple.\n\nWait, I'm making confusion again. Let's back up and think about this differently. I'm going to use (row, column) notation, with (0, 0) being the top-left corner.\n\nThe board is:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n# HS   #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nSo,\n- (0, 0) to (0, 7): Top row, all #\n- (1, 0) to (1, 7): Second row, # at edges and spaces in between\n- And so on.\n\nUsing this notation:\n- The head ('H') is at position (4, 2).\n- The body segment ('S') is at position (4, 3).\n- The apples ('A') are at positions (2, 3), (2, 6), and (5, 2).\n\nThe snake's current direction is LEFT. This means the snake's head is moving from right to left. So, the snake's head previously was at position (4, 3) (where the body is now) and moved to its current position (4, 2). If I continue moving LEFT, the head would go to position (4, 1).\n\nGiven the current direction is LEFT, the valid directions I can choose are: UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT. The snake can't reverse its direction, so RIGHT is not a valid choice.\n\n1. LEFT: Move to (4, 1). There's no apple here.\n2. UP: Move to (3, 2). No apple here either.\n3. DOWN: Move to (5, 2). There is an apple here!\n\nSo, moving DOWN would be the best choice, as it allows me to eat an apple and increase the score.\n\nLet me try to visualize the result of moving DOWN one more time:\n\nCurrent board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n# HS   #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nAfter moving DOWN, the head moves to (5, 2) and eats the apple. The head at (4, 2) becomes a body segment, and the tail remains at its current position because the snake ate an apple, thus growing in length:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n# S    #\n# H    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nActually, wait. I'm not taking into account the snake's body movement correctly. Let me clarify. I initially thought the snake's body after the head moves to (5, 2) would be (4, 2) and (4, 3). However, the snake's body doesn't include its previous head position.\n\nSo, after the move, the head would be at (5, 2), and the body would consist of the former head at (4, 2).\n\n\nLet's reconsider the scenario:\n\n1. Current state:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n# HS   #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\n- The head ('H') is at position (4, 2).\n- The body segment ('S') is at position (4, 3).\n- The apples ('A') are at positions (2, 3), (2, 6), and (5, 2).\n- The snake's current direction is LEFT.\n\n2. If I decide to move DOWN, the head would move to position (5, 2), where there's an apple. Since the head eats the apple, the snake grows in length, meaning the body segment at (4, 3) remains:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n# S    #\n# H    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nSo the result would be:\n- The head ('H') is at position (5, 2).\n- The snake's body consists of segments at positions (4, 2) and (4, 3).\n- The apples ('A') are now at positions (2, 3) and (2, 6).\n\nIt looks like moving DOWN is the best option, as it allows me to eat an apple and increase the score.\n\nActually, wait. I'm still unsure about the snake's body mechanics. If the snake's current direction is LEFT, I would expect the body to be trailing behind the head, meaning the body should be at positions to the right of the head.\n\nGiven the current state:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n# HS   #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nWith the head ('H') at (4, 2) and a body segment ('S') at (4, 3), it seems the snake is moving LEFT (from right to left), and the body is trailing behind the head.\n\nIf I were to move DOWN, the head would go to position (5, 2) and the body segments would follow. The head at (4, 2) would become a body segment, and the body segment at (4, 3) would move to (4, 2). \n\nActually, this doesn't seem right. Let's look at the example provided:\n\nIf the board is \n```\n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\nand the direction given is DOWN, then the result would be:\n```\n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\nIn this example, the head ('H') moved DOWN from (3, 1) to (4, 1) and the body segment ('S') moved from (2, 1) to (3, 1). The head ate an apple, and the snake grew in length, with the new body segment appearing at the previous head position.\n\nApplying this to our scenario:\n\n1. Current state:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n# HS   #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\n2. If I decide to move DOWN, the head would move to position (5, 2) (where there's an apple), and the body segment would move to the previous head position at (4, 2):\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n# S    #\n# H    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nThe snake would eat the apple, and the score would increase.\n\nSo, based on this understanding, moving DOWN is the best choice.\n\nJust want to be extremely careful and double-check since I've made a few mistakes. Let me fully analyze this again.\n\nGiven the following board state:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n# HS   #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\n- HEAD is at (4, 2)\n- Segment of the BODY (S) is at (4, 3)\n- Apples are at (2, 3), (2, 6), and (5, 2)\n- Current direction of the snake (the direction it's coming from) is LEFT\n\nValid moves given the current state:\n1. LEFT (continue in the same direction): Snake's head will move to (4, 1). There's no apple there.\n2. UP: Snake's head will move to (3, 2). No apple.\n3. DOWN: Snake's head will move to (5, 2). There's an apple there.\n\nConsequences of choosing DOWN:\n- The head will move from (4, 2) to (5, 2).\n- The body segment will move from (4, 3) to (4, 2).\n- The head will eat the apple at (5, 2), causing the snake to grow.\n- Since the snake eats an apple, a new body segment will appear at the previous head position (4, 2). So, the snake's body will now occupy positions (4, 2) and (4, 3).\n\nThe new game state would be:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n# S    #\n# H    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nBased on this analysis, moving DOWN is the most beneficial move as it allows the snake to eat an apple and increase its score.\n\nTherefore, the answer I would like to give is DOWN.Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n# HS   #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nI need to analyze the current situation:\n- The snake's head (H) is at position (4, 2)\n- There's a body segment (S) at position (4, 3)\n- There are three apples (A): at positions (2, 3), (2, 6), and (5, 2)\n- The current direction is LEFT\n\nSince the snake is moving LEFT, I can choose to continue LEFT or change direction to UP or DOWN (but not RIGHT, as that would be reversing direction).\n\nLet me assess my options:\n- LEFT: Would move to position (4, 1) where there's no apple\n- UP: Would move to position (3, 2) where there's no apple\n- DOWN: Would move to position (5, 2) where there IS an apple\n\nMoving DOWN is the best choice as it allows me to eat an apple immediately, increasing my score. After eating the apple, the snake will grow in length.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","HTTPError 529: {\"error\":{\"message\":\"-4316: Overloaded\",\"code\":\"-4307\"}}"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Game board:\n```\n########\n#A A   #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\n2. Current direction: UP\n\n3. Current epoch: 1\n\n4. The snake head is at position (4, 3) (counting rows and columns from 0, starting from the top-left corner).\n\nGiven that the snake is currently moving UP, I need to decide what direction to move next. Let's consider the options:\n\n1. Continue moving UP: The snake will move to position (3, 3), which is an empty cell. This is a safe move.\n2. Turn LEFT: The snake will move to position (4, 2), which is an empty cell. This is a safe move.\n3. Turn RIGHT: The snake will move to position (4, 4), which is an empty cell. This is a safe move.\n4. Move DOWN: This is the opposite of the current direction (UP), so it's not allowed according to the rules.\n\nSince the goal is to eat as many apples as possible, I should consider which direction will get me closer to an apple.\n\nLooking at the board, there are three apples:\n- Apple 1: (1, 1)\n- Apple 2: (1, 3)\n- Apple 3: (2, 7)\n\nIf I go UP, I'll be one step closer to Apple 2.\nIf I go LEFT, I'll be farther from all apples.\nIf I go RIGHT, I'll be closer to Apple 3, though it's still quite far.\n\nGiven these considerations, moving UP seems to be the best choice as it brings me directly towards Apple 2. So my answer is UP.\n\nActually, let me double-check the coordinates of the apples:\n- Apple 1: At position (1, 1), which is the second row, second column.\n- Apple 2: At position (1, 3), which is the second row, fourth column.\n- Apple 3: At position (2, 6), which is the third row, seventh column. (I think I miscounted earlier)\n\nGiven that, moving UP is still the best choice as it brings me directly towards Apple 2.Game board:\n```\n########\n#A A   #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nI need to decide which direction to move the snake. The snake head (H) is currently at the middle of the 5th row, and it's moving UP. Let's analyze the situation:\n\nThere are three apples on the board:\n- One apple at the top-left (position 1,1)\n- One apple at the top-middle (position 1,3)\n- One apple at the top-right area (position 3,7)\n\nSince the snake is currently moving UP and there's an apple directly above its path, the best move is to continue moving UP. This will bring the snake head closer to the apple at position (1,3).\n\nThe snake can't reverse direction (from UP to DOWN), but it can go LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP. Going UP is the most direct path to an apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","Let me analyze the game board:\n\n```\n########\n#A A   #\n#     A#\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is in row 3, column 3 (counting from 0).\nThe current direction is UP, which means the snake is moving toward the top of the board.\nThere are apples 'A' at positions: (1,1), (1,3), and (2,7) (counting from 0).\n\nSince the snake is currently moving UP and is at position (3,3), if it continues moving UP, it will move to position (2,3). There's no apple there, so the snake will just move without growing.\n\nLet's consider the possible moves:\n1. UP: The snake will move to (2,3). There's no apple there, and no collision.\n2. LEFT: The snake will move to (3,2). There's no apple there, and no collision.\n3. RIGHT: The snake will move to (3,4). There's no apple there, and no collision.\n4. DOWN: Since the current direction is UP, the snake can't move DOWN directly (can't reverse direction).\n\nAll three possible moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) are valid and don't lead to immediate collisions. However, I want to move towards an apple to score points.\n\nThe closest apples are at (1,1), (1,3), and (2,7).\n- The apple at (1,3) is directly above the snake (2 squares away), so moving UP gets me closer to it.\n- The apple at (1,1) is to the upper-left, so I would need to move LEFT and then UP.\n- The apple at (2,7) is to the upper-right, so I would need to move RIGHT and then UP.\n\nSince I'm already moving UP, and there's an apple directly above me, the most efficient move is to continue moving UP.\n\nSo, my answer is UP.\n\nActually, let me check my reasoning again. The snake head 'H' is at position (3,3) (counting from 0) or (4,4) (counting from 1). The current direction is UP, so the next position would be (3,2) (counting from 0) or (4,3) (counting from 1). \n\nChecking the board again, there's no apple at position (3,2) or (4,3). But if I continue moving UP, I'll eventually reach the apple at (1,3) or (2,4). Going LEFT would allow me to approach the apple at (1,1) or (2,2), and going RIGHT would let me approach the apple at (2,7) or (3,8).\n\nSince I can't go directly to any apple with a single move, I need to choose a direction that gets me closer to an apple. The apple at (1,3) or (2,4) is directly above me, so continuing to move UP is the best strategy to reach an apple quickly.\n\nActually, I think I've been misunderstanding the board. Let me try again by using 1-based indexing (counting from 1 to 8):\n\n```\n########  <- Row 1\n#A A   #  <- Row 2\n#     A#  <- Row 3\n#  H   #  <- Row 4\n#      #  <- Row 5\n#      #  <- Row 6\n#      #  <- Row 7\n########  <- Row 8\n```\n\nAnd columns:\n```\n#12345678\n1########\n2#A A   #\n3#     A#\n4#  H   #\n5#      #\n6#      #\n7#      #\n8########\n```\n\nSo, the snake's head 'H' is at position (4,3) (row 4, column 3).\nThe apples 'A' are at positions: (2,2), (2,4), and (3,7).\n\nIf the snake is moving UP, the next position would be (3,3). There's no apple there, but there's no collision either.\n\nLet's consider the possible moves again:\n1. UP: The snake will move to (3,3). No apple, no collision.\n2. LEFT: The snake will move to (4,2). No apple, no collision.\n3. RIGHT: The snake will move to (4,4). No apple, no collision.\n\nThe apple at (2,4) is directly above the snake's position if the snake goes RIGHT and then UP. The apple at (2,2) is to the upper-left, and the apple at (3,7) is to the right and slightly up.\n\nSince the snake is already moving UP, I have to choose between continuing UP, turning LEFT, or turning RIGHT. \n\nIf I go UP, I'll be at (3,3), and then I can go RIGHT to approach the apple at (2,4).\nIf I go LEFT, I'll be at (4,2), and then I can go UP to approach the apple at (2,2).\nIf I go RIGHT, I'll be at (4,4), and then I can go UP to approach the apple at (2,4) or go further RIGHT to approach the apple at (3,7).\n\nOk, I think I should go RIGHT, because it gives me options to approach two different apples.\n\nActually, let's one more time really make sure I'm getting the positions correct. I'll label the board with row and column indices:\n\n```\n    12345678 <- Column\n   ########\n1  #A A   #\n2  #     A#\n3  #  H   #\n4  #      #\n5  #      #\n6  #      #\n7  #      #\n   ########\n^\nRow\n```\n\nAh, I can see the snake's head 'H' is at position (3, 3) (row 3, column 3).\nThe apples 'A' are at positions: (1, 2), (1, 4), and (2, 7).\n\nThe current direction is UP, so the snake is moving towards row 2.\n\nIf the snake moves UP, it will go to position (2, 3). There's no apple there, no collision.\nIf the snake moves LEFT, it will go to position (3, 2). There's no apple there, no collision.\nIf the snake moves RIGHT, it will go to position (3, 4). There's no apple there, no collision.\n\nThe apple at (1, 4) is almost directly above the snake. If the snake goes RIGHT and then UP, it can reach this apple.\nThe apple at (1, 2) is to the upper-left. If the snake goes LEFT and then UP, it can reach this apple.\nThe apple at (2, 7) is to the right. The snake would need to move RIGHT multiple times, then UP to reach it.\n\nHmm, this is actually a complex decision. \n\nLet me think about it more carefully:\n- Moving UP will position me closer to the top row where there are two apples.\n- Moving LEFT will position me closer to the apple at (1, 2).\n- Moving RIGHT will position me closer to the apples at (1, 4) and (2, 7).\n\nI think moving RIGHT is the best choice here because it gives me options to approach two different apples, and it positions me better for future moves.\n\nSo, my final answer is RIGHT.\n\nI'm having a hard time determining the coordinates. Let's be very careful. The board is:\n\n```\n########\n#A A   #\n#     A#\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nThe top-left corner is at position (0, 0). The snake's head 'H' is at position (3, 3). The apples 'A' are at positions (1, 1), (1, 3), and (2, 6).\n\nIf the snake moves UP, it will go to position (2, 3). There's no apple there, no collision.\nIf the snake moves LEFT, it will go to position (3, 2). There's no apple there, no collision.\nIf the snake moves RIGHT, it will go to position (3, 4). There's no apple there, no collision.\n\nIn this step, none of the moves will lead to immediately eating an apple. But I want to position my snake optimally for future moves.\n\nThe apple at (1, 3) is directly above the snake's current position. If the snake moves UP and then UP again, it can reach this apple.\nThe apple at (1, 1) is to the upper-left. The snake would need to move LEFT multiple times, then UP to reach it.\nThe apple at (2, 6) is to the upper-right. The snake would need to move RIGHT multiple times, then UP to reach it.\n\nGiven this, moving UP seems like the best choice because it positions me closer to the apple at (1, 3), which is the most directly accessible.\n\nOk, let's check my reasoning again. If I use 0-indexed coordinates:\n```\n    01234567 <- Column\n   ########\n0  #A A   #\n1  #     A#\n2  #  H   #\n3  #      #\n4  #      #\n5  #      #\n6  #      #\n   ########\n^\nRow\n```\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (2, 3).\nThe apples 'A' are at positions: (0, 1), (0, 3), and (1, 6).\n\nThe current direction is UP, which means the snake is moving towards smaller row values.\n\nIf the snake moves UP, it will go to position (1, 3). There's no apple there, no collision.\nIf the snake moves LEFT, it will go to position (2, 2). There's no apple there, no collision.\nIf the snake moves RIGHT, it will go to position (2, 4). There's no apple there, no collision.\n\nThe apple at (0, 3) is directly above the snake's current position. If the snake moves UP and then UP again, it can reach this apple.\nThe apple at (0, 1) is to the upper-left. The snake would need to move LEFT multiple times, then UP to reach it.\nThe apple at (1, 6) is to the upper-right. The snake would need to move RIGHT multiple times, then UP to reach it.\n\nGiven this, moving UP seems like the best choice because it positions me closer to the apple at (0, 3), which is the most directly accessible.\n\nHowever, let me also consider the consequences of other moves:\n\nIf I move LEFT, I'm moving away from the apples at (0, 3) and (1, 6), and moving towards the apple at (0, 1). This might be a longer path to get any apple.\n\nIf I move RIGHT, I'm moving away from the apple at (0, 1), but I'm moving towards the apples at (0, 3) (which is already directly above me) and (1, 6). This might give me more flexibility.\n\nGiven the current epoch is 2, and I'm not at immediate risk of a game ending, I still think moving UP is the best choice because it directly targets the apple at (0, 3), which is the closest to my current position.\n\nSo, my final answer is UP.\n\nAlternatively, I can interpret the board with 1-indexed coordinates:\n```\n    12345678 <- Column\n   ########\n1  #A A   #\n2  #     A#\n3  #  H   #\n4  #      #\n5  #      #\n6  #      #\n7  #      #\n   ########\n^\nRow\n```\n\nBut it doesn't change my reasoning.\n\nActually, I think I can be even more careful. Let me mark the coordinates on the board itself:\n\n```\n    01234567 <- Column\n  ########\n0 #A A   #\n1 #     A#\n2 #  H   #\n3 #      #\n4 #      #\n5 #      #\n6 #      #\n  ########\n^\nRow\n```\n\nNow, let's identify the positions:\n- Snake's head 'H' is at position (2, 3).\n- Apples 'A' are at positions: (0, 1), (0, 3), and (1, 6).\n\nCurrent direction is UP, which means the snake is moving towards smaller row values.\n\nLet's consider the possible moves:\n1. UP: The snake will move to (1, 3). There's no apple there, no collision.\n2. LEFT: The snake will move to (2, 2). There's no apple there, no collision.\n3. RIGHT: The snake will move to (2, 4). There's no apple there, no collision.\n\nThe apple at (0, 3) is directly above the snake's current position. If the snake moves UP and then UP again, it can reach this apple.\nThe apple at (0, 1) is to the upper-left. The snake would need to move LEFT and then UP, and LEFT again to reach it.\nThe apple at (1, 6) is to the upper-right. The snake would need to move RIGHT multiple times, then UP to reach it.\n\nGiven this, moving UP seems like the best choice because it moves directly towards the apple at (0, 3), which is the most directly accessible.\n\nSo, my final answer is UP.\n\nActually, let me check the board one more time to make sure I correctly identified the position of the snake's head and the apples. \n\nLet's start by being explicit about how I'm addressing rows and columns:\n- Row 0 is the top row of the board, and row 7 is the bottom row.\n- Column 0 is the leftmost column, and column 7 is the rightmost column.\n\nNow, let's reread the board:\n\n```\n########\n#A A   #\n#     A#\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nGiven our convention:\n- The snake's head 'H' is on the 4th row (row 3) and the 3rd column (column 2) from the left. So, its position is (3, 2).\n- The apples 'A' are at positions: (1, 1), (1, 3), and (2, 6).\n\nWait, I think I was not looking at the board carefully enough. Let's double-check by marking the coordinates on the board:\n\n```\n    01234567 <- Column\n  ########\n0 #A A   #\n1 #     A#\n2 #  H   #\n3 #      #\n4 #      #\n5 #      #\n6 #      #\n  ########\n^\nRow\n```\n\nOk, so:\n- Snake's head 'H' is at position (2, 2).\n- Apples 'A' are at positions: (0, 1), (0, 3), and (1, 6).\n\nActually, let's be even more careful:\n```\n    12345678 <- Column (adjusted for board representation)\n  ########  <- Row 0 (border)\n1 #A A   #  <- Row 1\n2 #     A#  <- Row 2\n3 #  H   #  <- Row 3\n4 #      #  <- Row 4\n5 #      #  <- Row 5\n6 #      #  <- Row 6\n7 #      #  <- Row 7\n  ######## <- Row 8 (border)\n^\nRow (adjusted for board representation)\n```\n\nOk, I think I'm overthinking it. \n\nLet me simplify:\nThe board is an 8x8 grid, with a border of '#' characters.\nThe snake's head 'H' is inside the grid.\nThere are three apples 'A' inside the grid.\n\nThe snake's current direction is UP.\n\nI think the clearest way to describe the snake's position is relative to the grid, not the visual representation in the text.\n\nIn the grid, the snake's head is on the 3rd row and the 3rd column (counting from the edge of the grid, not counting the borders).\nThe apples are on the 1st row and 2nd column, the 1st row and 4th column, and the 2nd row and 7th column.\n\nNow, if the snake moves UP, it will approach the apple on the 1st row and 4th column.\nIf the snake moves LEFT, it will move away from the apples.\nIf the snake moves RIGHT, it will approach the apple on the 2nd row and 7th column.\n\nGiven that the snake is already heading UP, and there's an apple directly in its path (on the 1st row and 4th column), it makes sense to continue moving UP.\n\nSo, my final answer is UP.\n\nOk, one final approach to be sure:\n\nLet's assign coordinates to the grid, where (0,0) is the top-left corner of the actual grid (not counting the borders).\n\nWith this convention, the board looks like:\n\n```\n########\n#A A   #  <- Row 0\n#     A#  <- Row 1\n#  H   #  <- Row 2\n#      #  <- Row 3\n#      #  <- Row 4\n#      #  <- Row 5\n#      #  <- Row 6\n########\n ^\n Column 0\n```\n\nPosition of the snake's head 'H': (2, 2)\nPositions of the apples 'A': (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 6)\n\nThe snake is currently moving UP.\n\nIf the snake moves UP, it will go to position (1, 2). There's no apple there, but it's getting closer to the apple at (0, 3).\nIf the snake moves LEFT, it will go to position (2, 1). There's no apple there, but it might be getting closer to the apple at (0, 1).\nIf the snake moves RIGHT, it will go to position (2, 3). There's no apple there, but it might be getting closer to the apple at (1, 6).\n\nGiven that the snake's current direction is UP, and there's an apple at (0, 3) which is almost directly above the snake (just one column to the right), it makes sense to continue moving UP and then plan to move RIGHT to reach that apple.\n\nSo, my final answer is UP.\n\nAcutally, I think I was confusing myself by how I was reading the board. Let me count the cells, not counting the walls:\n\n```\n01234567  <- Column\n########\n#A A   #  0\n#     A#  1\n#  H   #  2\n#      #  3\n#      #  4\n#      #  5\n#      #  6\n########\n^\nRow\n```\n\nWith this convention:\n- The snake's head 'H' is at position (2, 2).\n- The apples 'A' are at positions: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 6).\n\nThe snake is currently moving UP (towards smaller row values).\n\nIf the snake moves UP, it will go to position (1, 2). There's no apple there, but it's getting closer to the apple at (0, 3).\nIf the snake moves LEFT, it will go to position (2, 1). There's no apple there, but it might be getting closer to the apple at (0, 1).\nIf the snake moves RIGHT, it will go to position (2, 3). There's no apple there, but it might be getting closer to the apple at (1, 6).\n\nGiven that the snake's current direction is UP, continuing to move UP would position the snake to approach the apple at (0, 3) (which is slightly to the right) after this move.\n\nSo, my final answer is UP.\n\nActuallty, let's check carefully. Here's the board:\n```\n########\n#A A   #\n#     A#\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nLet me number the positions within the board, not counting the walls:\n```\n  01234567\n ########\n0#A A   #\n1#     A#\n2#  H   #\n3#      #\n4#      #\n5#      #\n6#      #\n ########\n```\n\nNow, let's identify the positions:\n- Snake's head 'H' is at position (row 2, column 2). \n- Apples 'A' are at positions: (row 0, column 1), (row 0, column 3), and (row 1, column 6).\n\nThe snake is currently moving UP, which means it's moving towards smaller row values.\n\nIf the snake moves UP, it will go to position (1, 2). There's no apple there, but it's getting closer to the apples at (0, 1) and (0, 3).\nIf the snake moves LEFT, it will go to position (2, 1). There's no apple there, but it might be a step towards the apple at (0, 1).\nIf the snake moves RIGHT, it will go to position (2, 3). There's no apple there, but it might be a step towards the apples at (0, 3) and (1, 6).\n\nGiven the current direction is UP and there are two apples in the direction the snake is heading (even if not directly), continuing to move UP is reasonable.\n\nSo, my final answer is UP.Game board:\n```\n########\n#A A   #\n#     A#\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nI'll analyze the current game state and determine the best move.\n\nThe snake's head (H) is in the middle of the board, and there are three apples:\n- One in the top-left corner\n- One in the top-middle area\n- One in the right side of the second row\n\nThe snake is currently moving UP. If I continue moving UP, I'll get closer to the apple that's directly above me (though not immediately reachable). This is a good option because it positions me to reach one of the top apples in the fewest moves.\n\nMoving LEFT would take me toward the top-left apple, but would require more total moves than continuing upward.\n\nMoving RIGHT would position me better to potentially reach either the top-middle apple or the one on the right side.\n\nSince the snake is already moving UP and there's an apple that can be reached by continuing in this direction (with just one more move after this one), continuing UP is the most efficient choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","HTTPError 529: {\"error\":{\"message\":\"-4316: Overloaded\",\"code\":\"-4307\"}}"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

There are three apples (A) on the board: one above the snake, one to the right of the snake's head, and one below the snake's head.\n\nLet's think about the possible moves:\n1. UP: The snake would move upwards from its current position. There's nothing blocking it, and it would not collide with any wall or part of its body. Moving upward would actually allow the snake to eat an apple in the next move.\n2. LEFT: The snake would move to the left from its current position. There's nothing blocking it, and it would not collide with any wall or part of its body.\n3. RIGHT: The snake would move to the right from its current position. There's nothing blocking it, and it would not collide with any wall or part of its body. Moving right would actually allow the snake to eat an apple in the next move.\n4. DOWN: The snake is currently moving UP, and the rules state that the snake cannot reverse its direction directly. So the snake cannot turn from UP to DOWN.\n\nSo, the valid moves are UP, LEFT, and RIGHT. Among these, UP and RIGHT would lead to eating an apple in the next move. Let's choose RIGHT since it's an optimal move that allows the snake to eat an apple immediately.\n\nActually, let me double check my logic. The snake's head is at position marked with 'H', and it's currently moving in the UP direction. The apples are at positions marked with 'A'. If the snake moves RIGHT, it will move to the position of an apple and eat it, which will increase the score by 1.\n\nSo, my answer is RIGHT.Game board:\n```\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  HA  #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nI need to decide the best direction to move the snake from its current position.\n\nLooking at the game board, I can see:\n- The snake's head (H) is in the middle of the board\n- There's an apple (A) directly to the right of the head\n- There's an apple (A) above but not directly accessible in one move\n- There's an apple (A) below the head\n\nThe snake is currently moving UP. According to the rules, I can move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (but not DOWN as that would be a reversal of direction).\n\nThe most immediate opportunity is to move RIGHT to eat the apple next to the snake's head. This would increase the score by 1 and grow the snake.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Let me analyze the game state and determine the best move.\n\nCurrent Game Board:\n```\n########\n# AA   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SH  #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent Direction: RIGHT\nCurrent Epoch: 2\n\nIn this game board:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at position (4, 4) (counting from 0, if rows from top to bottom and columns from left to right)\n- The snake's body ('S') has one segment at position (4, 3)\n- There are three apples ('A') at positions (1, 2), (1, 3), and (5, 4)\n- The current direction is RIGHT, meaning the snake is moving to the right\n\nGiven that the current direction is RIGHT, the possible directions I can move are:\n- RIGHT (continue moving right)\n- UP (turn 90 degrees counter-clockwise)\n- DOWN (turn 90 degrees clockwise)\n\nI cannot move LEFT as that would be a direct reversal of direction, which is not allowed according to the rules.\n\nLet's consider each valid option:\n\n1. RIGHT: \n   - The next position would be (4, 5)\n   - There's no apple there, but it's a valid move (no wall or self-collision)\n   - This would take me closer to the apple at (5, 4)\n\n2. UP:\n   - The next position would be (3, 4)\n   - There's no apple there, but it's a valid move (no wall or self-collision)\n   - This would take me closer to the apples at the top of the board (1, 2) and (1, 3)\n\n3. DOWN:\n   - The next position would be (5, 4)\n   - There's an apple at this position! Eating it would increase my score and grow the snake\n   - This is a valid move with immediate reward\n\nGiven these options, moving DOWN is the best choice because I can immediately eat an apple, increase my score, and grow the snake.\n\nWait, I need to double-check this.

The apple is at position (5, 4), not (5, 5) as I mistakenly noted. Moving DOWN would indeed take me directly to this apple.\n\nMy answer is DOWN.Game board:\n```\n########\n# AA   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SH  #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nLooking at the game board, I can see:\n- The snake's head (H) is facing right with one body segment (S) behind it\n- There are three apples (A): two at the top of the board and one below the snake's head\n- The current direction is RIGHT\n\nSince I'm moving RIGHT, my possible moves are:\n- Continue RIGHT\n- Turn UP\n- Turn DOWN\n\nLooking at these options:\n- If I move RIGHT, I'll continue along an empty path\n- If I move UP, I'll head toward the apples at the top, but they're still far away\n- If I move DOWN, I'll immediately eat the apple that's directly below my head\n\nThe best move is to turn DOWN to eat the apple immediately below me.

Game board size: 8x8\n2. Snake: The head is represented by 'H' and is at position (4, 3) (counting from top-left starting at 0)\n3. Current direction: UP\n4. Apples: There are 3 apples on the board:\n   - One at (2, 6) \n   - One at (3, 3)\n   - One at (6, 6)\n\nNow I need to decide which direction to move the snake. The snake is currently moving UP, and it can either continue UP or change to LEFT or RIGHT. It cannot move DOWN because that would be a direct reversal of direction.\n\nLet's look at the possible moves:\n\n1. UP: If the snake moves UP, it will move to position (3, 3), which has an apple. This would eat the apple, increase the score, and grow the snake.\n2. LEFT: If the snake moves LEFT, it will move to position (4, 2). There is no apple there.\n3. RIGHT: If the snake moves RIGHT, it will move to position (4, 4). There is no apple there.\n\nSince there's an apple directly above the snake's head, the best move would be to continue moving UP to eat that apple.\n\nSo the optimal direction to move is UP.Game board:\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#  A   #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nLooking at the current game board, I can see:\n- The snake's head (H) is at position (4,3)\n- There are three apples (A): one directly above the head at (3,3), one in the upper right at (2,6), and one in the lower right at (6,6)\n- The snake is currently moving UP\n\nSince there's an apple directly above the snake's head, the best move is to continue moving UP to eat that apple. Moving UP will allow the snake to eat the apple, grow in length, and increase the score by 1.\n\nAnswer: UP","Let me analyze the game board:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#  H   #\n#  S   #\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head is at position (3, 3) (starting from 0 and counting from the top-left corner), and its body extends one segment down to (4, 3). \n\nThe current direction is UP, which means the snake is currently moving upward.\n\nThere are three apples: \n- One at position (2, 6)\n- One at position (5, 3)\n- One at position (6, 6)\n\nGiven that the snake is currently moving UP, I need to decide on the next direction. My options are:\n1. Continue moving UP\n2. Turn LEFT\n3. Turn RIGHT\n\nI cannot move DOWN since that would reverse the snake's direction, causing it to collide with its own body.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n1. UP: If I move UP, the snake's head will go to position (2, 3). This is an empty space, so it's a valid move.\n2. LEFT: If I move LEFT, the snake's head will go to position (3, 2). This is also an empty space, so it's a valid move.\n3. RIGHT: If I move RIGHT, the snake's head will go to position (3, 4). This is also an empty space, so it's a valid move.\n\nThe closest apple is the one at position (5, 3), which is directly below the snake's body. However, I can't reach it directly by moving DOWN (because that would reverse direction). I could either move LEFT or RIGHT and then DOWN to reach this apple.\n\nAnother apple is at position (2, 6), which is to the right and up from the snake's current position. I could move RIGHT and then UP to get closer to this apple.\n\nThe third apple is at position (6, 6), which is further away.\n\nLet's think strategically. If I move RIGHT, I can then move DOWN to approach the apple at (5, 3). If I move LEFT, I'll be moving away from all apples initially. If I move UP, I'll be moving toward the apple at (2, 6), but I'll need to turn RIGHT at some point.\n\nGiven that the apple at (5, 3) seems to be the easiest to reach, I'll choose to move RIGHT so that in the next step, I can move DOWN toward it.\n\nMy answer is RIGHT.Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#  H   #\n#  S   #\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nLooking at the current game board, I can see that the snake's head (H) is at position (3,3) with one body segment (S) below it at (4,3). The snake is currently moving UP.\n\nThere are three apples (A) on the board:\n- One at position (2,6)\n- One at position (5,3) directly below the snake\n- One at position (6,6)\n\nSince the snake is moving UP, my options are to continue moving UP or turn LEFT or RIGHT. I cannot move DOWN as that would cause a collision with the snake's body.\n\nThe most strategic move would be to turn RIGHT, which would position me to then move DOWN in the next turn to reach the apple below. This gives me a clear path to an apple with minimal movement.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Let's analyze the game board:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#  SH  #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nThe snake consists of a head (H) and one body segment (S). The snake is currently moving RIGHT. I need to decide which direction to move next: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nFirst, let's check if any of the directions would result in a collision:\n- UP: This would move the head to position (3, 2), which is empty. No collision.\n- DOWN: This would move the head to position (3, 4), which is empty. No collision.\n- LEFT: This would move the head back to position where the body (S) is at (3, 2). This would be a collision with the snake's body.\n- RIGHT: This would move the head to position (3, 4), which is empty. No collision.\n\nSince I cannot move LEFT (it would cause a collision with the snake's body), I have to choose between UP, DOWN, or continuing RIGHT.\n\nThe current position of the snake's head is at coordinates (3, 3), where the top-left corner of the board is (0, 0).\n\nLet's look at the positions of the apples:\n1. (2, 6) - in row 2, column 6\n2. (5, 3) - in row 5, column 3\n3. (6, 6) - in row 6, column 6\n\nI want to move towards the closest apple. Currently, the snake's head is at (3, 3).\n\nThe closest apple is at (5, 3), which is two steps down from the snake's current position. So, moving DOWN would bring the snake closer to this apple.\n\nI'll choose to move DOWN.\n\nThinking about it more, there's a bit of confusion. My answer depends on how we're interpreting the coordinates.\n\nLet me re-analyze:\n\nIf we consider the top-left corner as (0, 0) and count rows going down and columns going right, then:\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at (3, 4) (4th row, 5th column).\nThe snake's body (S) is at (3, 3) (4th row, 4th column).\n\nThe apples (A) are at:\n1. (2, 6) (3rd row, 7th column)\n2. (5, 3) (6th row, 4th column)\n3. (6, 6) (7th row, 7th column)\n\nGiven that the snake is moving RIGHT, the next natural move would be to continue RIGHT, but that wouldn't lead directly to any apple. I have three choices: UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT.\n\nLet's see which direction would bring the snake closer to an apple:\n- UP would move the head to (2, 4), which is one step closer to the apple at (2, 6).\n- DOWN would move the head to (4, 4), which is one step closer to the apple at (5, 3).\n- RIGHT would move the head to (3, 5), which is not specifically closer to any apple compared to its current position.\n\nI think it's more efficient to move DOWN in this situation, as it would lead the snake towards the apple at (5, 3).\n\nActually, I think we're making this too complicated. Let's simplify.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#  SH  #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nThe snake is moving RIGHT, as indicated.\n\nIf we move UP, we'd get closer to the apple at the top right. If we move DOWN, we'd get closer to the apple in the middle left.\n\nLet's move DOWN to get closer to the middle apple, and then we can move LEFT to eat it.\n\nTherefore, my answer is DOWN.\n\nWait, let me think through this one more time, because I'm not sure if I'm visualizing this correctly.\n\nThe snake's body (S) is to the left of the head (H):\n\n```\n#  SH  #\n```\n\nThe snake is moving RIGHT. If I give the command DOWN, the snake would move one step down from its current position.\n\nI think I did get it right originally. Moving DOWN would bring the snake closer to the apple at (5, 3), which is the closest apple.\n\nThe answer is DOWN.Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#  SH  #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nLooking at the current game board:\n- The snake's head (H) is moving RIGHT\n- There is one body segment (S) to the left of the head\n- There are three apples (A) on the board: one in the top-right area, one in the middle-left area, and one in the bottom-right area\n\nSince the snake is currently moving RIGHT, I have three possible moves: continue going RIGHT, turn UP, or turn DOWN.

Can't reverse direction (so it can't go from UP to DOWN directly)\n2. Must avoid collisions with walls and itself\n3. Eats apples and grows in length when the head moves to an apple's position\n\nSince the current direction is UP and the snake can't reverse direction, I can choose to move LEFT, RIGHT, or UP. Let's consider each:\n\n- If I move UP, the snake will move to the 4th row, 3rd column. This is within the board and there's no apple there, so the snake just moves without growing.\n- If I move LEFT, the snake will move to the 5th row, 2nd column. This is within the board and there's no apple there, so the snake just moves without growing.\n- If I move RIGHT, the snake will move to the 5th row, 4th column. This is within the board and there's an apple there ('A'). If I choose this, the snake will eat the apple and grow in length.\n\nSince one of my goals is to eat as many apples as possible to increase my score, I should choose to move RIGHT to eat the apple.\n\nSo my answer is \"RIGHT\".Looking at the current game board:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  HAA #\n#    A #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nI can see the snake head 'H' is at row 5, column 3 with no body segments yet. There are three apples on the board - two apples in row 5 (right after the snake head) and one apple in row 6.\n\nThe current direction is UP, which means the snake is currently moving upward. Since the snake cannot reverse direction, I cannot choose DOWN.\n\nMy options are:\n- LEFT: This would move the snake head to an empty space\n- RIGHT: This would move the snake head onto an apple, increasing my score\n- UP: This would move the snake head to an empty space\n\nSince my goal is to eat as many apples as possible, I'll move RIGHT to eat the adjacent apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Let me analyze the given game board and current state:\n\n```\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SHA #\n#    A #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\n- The snake head (H) is currently facing RIGHT\n- The snake body (S) is to the left of the head\n- There are three apples (A) on the board:\n  1. One in the top row\n  2. One next to the snake head\n  3. One in the row below the snake\n\nThe snake's current direction is RIGHT, which means it's moving to the right. Let's consider the possible moves:\n\n1. RIGHT: The snake would move to position of the apple (A) that's next to its head. This would make the snake eat the apple, grow in length, and the score would increase by 1.\n2. UP: The snake would move up, which is a valid move since the snake can turn 90 degrees.\n3. DOWN: The snake would move down, which is also a valid move.\n4. LEFT: The snake cannot go left as that would be a 180-degree turn from its current RIGHT direction, which is not allowed according to the rules.\n\nSince the goal is to eat as many apples as possible, and there's an apple immediately to the right of the snake's head, the best move would be to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nSo my answer is RIGHT.Game board:\n```\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SHA #\n#    A #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nLooking at the current game state:\n- The snake head (H) is currently facing RIGHT (indicated by the direction)\n- There's a snake segment (S) to the left of the head\n- There's an apple (A) immediately to the right of the head\n- There are two other apples: one in the top row and one in the row below the snake's position\n\nSince there's an apple right next to the snake's head in the direction it's currently moving, the best move is to continue going RIGHT. This will allow the snake to eat the apple, grow longer, and increase the score by 1.\n\nI can't turn LEFT because that would be a 180-degree turn from the current RIGHT direction, which isn't allowed by the rules. Both UP and DOWN are valid moves, but RIGHT is the optimal choice to immediately collect an apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Let me analyze the game board:\n\n```\n########\n#A A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SSH #\n#    A #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at the right end of \"SSH\" in row 5. The current direction is RIGHT, so the snake is moving to the right.\n\nThe possible moves for the snake are:\n- UP (moving upward from the head)\n- DOWN (moving downward from the head)\n- RIGHT (continuing in the current direction)\n\nSince the snake cannot reverse its direction, it cannot move LEFT directly from RIGHT.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n1. UP: Moving upward would place the head at an empty space. The snake won't eat an apple, but it's a safe move.\n2. DOWN: Moving downward would place the head at a space with an apple ('A'). The snake would eat the apple, grow in length, and increase the score by 1.\n3. RIGHT: Moving right would place the head at an empty space. The snake won't eat an apple, but it's a safe move.\n\nSince there's an apple directly below the snake's head, the best move would be DOWN to eat the apple and increase the score.\n\nSo, my answer is \"DOWN\".Game board:\n```\n########\n#A A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SSH #\n#    A #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nLooking at the current game state, the snake's head (H) is at the right end of \"SSH\" in row 5, moving to the right. I need to decide the next direction for the snake.\n\nI can see that:\n- There's an apple (A) directly below the snake's head\n- The snake cannot move left (would reverse direction)\n- Moving up would lead to an empty space\n- Moving right would lead to an empty space\n- Moving down would allow the snake to eat the apple, grow longer, and increase the score\n\nThe optimal move is to go DOWN to eat the apple. This will increase the score by 1 and grow the snake's length.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","HTTPError 529: {\"error\":{\"message\":\"-4316: Overloaded\",\"code\":\"-4307\"}}"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The snake's head is represented by 'H' and is currently at (4, 3) on the game board (using 0-indexed coordinates).\n2. The snake's body is represented by 'S', and there's no body segment in the current state, which means the snake has a length of 1 (just the head).\n3. Apples are represented by 'A', and there are three apples on the board at coordinates (1, 6), (2, 3), and (4, 5).\n4. The snake is currently moving in the 'UP' direction.\n\nNow, I need to decide which direction to move the snake. Let's consider the options:\n\n1. UP: The snake will move from (4, 3) to (3, 3). There's no apple, body segment, or wall at that position, so the snake will simply move there.\n2. RIGHT: The snake will move from (4, 3) to (4, 4). There's no apple, body segment, or wall at that position, so the snake will simply move there.\n3. LEFT: The snake will move from (4, 3) to (4, 2). There's no apple, body segment, or wall at that position, so the snake will simply move there.\n4. DOWN: I can't choose DOWN because the snake is currently moving UP, and it can't reverse its direction.\n\nLet's think about the long-term strategy. The closest apple is at (2, 3), which is directly two cells above the snake's head. Since the snake is already moving in the UP direction, the best move would be to continue going UP to reach this apple.\n\nMy answer is UP.I'll analyze the current game board:\n\n```\n########\n#     A#\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#  HA  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nIn this board:\n- The snake's head (H) is at position (4,3)\n- There's an apple (A) directly above the head at position (2,3)\n- There are two other apples at positions (1,6) and (4,5)\n- The snake is currently moving UP\n- The snake has no body segments yet (just the head)\n\nGiven that the snake is already moving UP and there's an apple directly in that path, the best move is to continue moving UP. This will take the snake's head toward the apple at position (2,3).\n\nIf I move UP, the snake will move from position (4,3) to (3,3) in the next turn, getting closer to the apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","Let me analyze the current state of the Snake game:\n\nGame board:\n```\n########\n#     A#\n#  A   #\n#  H   #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 2\n\nThe snake is currently just one unit (the head 'H') at position (3, 3) (counting from top-left, 0-indexed).\n\nThe current direction is UP, which means the snake is moving upward. If I continue in the UP direction, the snake will move to position (2, 3) where there is an apple ('A'). This is a good move because I'll eat an apple, increase my score, and grow the snake.\n\nLet me consider other options:\n- LEFT: The snake would move to position (3, 2), which is empty. No immediate benefit.\n- RIGHT: The snake would move to position (3, 4), which is empty, but there's an apple at (4, 4) that I could get in the next move.\n- DOWN: This would be a reversal of the current UP direction, which is not allowed by the rules.\n\nGiven that I can eat an apple by continuing in the UP direction, that seems like the best choice.\n\nSo, my answer is to continue moving UP.Game board:\n```\n########\n#     A#\n#  A   #\n#  H   #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nI need to decide the best direction for the snake.\n\nCurrently, the snake is at position (3,3) and moving UP. Looking at the board, I can see:\n- If I go UP, I'll move to (2,3) where there's an apple. This will increase my score and grow my snake.\n- If I go LEFT, I'll move to (3,2) which is empty.\n- If I go RIGHT, I'll move to (3,4) which is empty, but there's an apple at (4,4) I could get next move.\n- Going DOWN would reverse my direction, which is not allowed.\n\nSince I can immediately eat an apple by continuing UP, this is clearly the best choice. I'll eat the apple at (2,3), grow in length, and gain a point.\n\nAnswer: UP","Let me analyze the current state of the game:\n\nGame board:\n```\n########\n#     A#\n#  H   #\n#  S   #\n#   A A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 3\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at row 2 (0-indexed), column 2, and its body (S) is at row 3, column 2. This means the snake is currently moving upward.\n\nThere are 3 apples (A) on the board:\n1. At row 0, column 6\n2. At row 4, column 3\n3. At row 4, column 5\n\nI need to decide which direction to move the snake. Since the current direction is UP, I can move LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP. I cannot move DOWN directly since that would be a 180-degree turn.\n\nLet's analyze my options:\n\n1. UP: If I continue going UP, I'll move to (row 1, column 2). There's no apple there, but it's a safe move.\n2. LEFT: If I go LEFT, I'll move to (row 2, column 1). There's no apple there, but it's a safe move.\n3. RIGHT: If I go RIGHT, I'll move to (row 2, column 3). There's no apple there, but it's a safe move.\n\nNow I need to decide which direction is the best to go. I should consider where the nearest apple is and try to move towards it.\n\nThe apples are at:\n1. (row 0, column 6) - towards the top right\n2. (row 4, column 3) - towards the bottom right\n3. (row 4, column 5) - towards the bottom right\n\nThe nearest apple is at (row 4, column 3), which is 5 steps away (2 down, 3 right). However, I can't go down directly since I'm currently going UP.\n\nThe apple at (row 0, column 6) is 6 steps away (2 up, 4 right).\n\nSince I can't go down directly, let's plan to go for the apple at (row 0, column 6). To get there, I should first go RIGHT, then continue upward.\n\nSo, my decision is to go RIGHT.\n\nLet me double-check: If I go RIGHT, I'll move to (row 2, column 3), which is a safe move. There's no apple there, but it's a step towards the apple at (row 0, column 6).\n\nMy answer is RIGHT.Game board:\n```\n########\n#     A#\n#  H   #\n#  S   #\n#   A A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head (H) is currently moving upward, with one body segment (S) directly below it. I see three apples on the board - one at the top right, and two at the bottom.\n\nSince I'm moving UP, I can't suddenly go DOWN (that would be a reverse). My options are to continue UP, or turn LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nLooking at the nearest apples:\n- There's an apple in the top-right corner\n- There are two apples in the lower part of the board\n\nThe most efficient move would be to turn RIGHT to start moving toward the apple in the top-right corner. Going RIGHT is safe - there's no wall or snake body in that direction.\n\nBy turning RIGHT, I can begin navigating toward the apple, and then later move UP to reach it when I'm in the proper column.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","HTTPError 529: {\"error\":{\"message\":\"-4316: Overloaded\",\"code\":\"-4307\"}}"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

In this board:\n- The snake's head (H) is at position (4, 2) (counting from the top-left, 0-indexed)\n- There are apples (A) at positions (2, 1), (3, 1), and (6, 3)\n- The current direction is UP\n\nSince the snake is currently moving UP, it means in the next move, the head will go to position (3, 2).\n\nThe valid directions I can choose are:\n- UP (continue in the current direction)\n- LEFT (turn 90 degrees left from current direction)\n- RIGHT (turn 90 degrees right from current direction)\n\nI cannot choose DOWN as it's the opposite of the current direction.\n\nLet's think about the best move:\n- If I go UP, I'll move closer to the apple at (3, 1) and eventually be able to eat it\n- If I go LEFT, I'll move away from all apples\n- If I go RIGHT, I'll move slightly closer to the apple at (6, 3), but that's further away than the apple I can reach by going UP\n\nThe best choice seems to be to continue moving UP, as this will lead me directly toward an apple.\n\nSo my answer is UP.I'll repeat the current game board:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n# A    #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nAnalyzing the situation:\n- The snake's head (H) is at position (4,2)\n- There are three apples (A) on the board: one at (2,0), one at (3,1), and one at (6,3)\n- The snake is currently moving UP\n- Valid directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (cannot go DOWN as it's opposite to current direction)\n\nLooking at the closest apples, if I continue moving UP, I'll be able to reach the apple at (3,1) in just one more move. This is the most efficient choice to increase my score quickly.\n\nMoving LEFT or RIGHT would take me away from the closest apple and be less efficient.\n\nTherefore, I'll continue moving UP to head directly toward the nearest apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","Let me analyze this Snake game scenario:\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n# AH   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (3,3) (assuming 0-indexed, row 3, column 3). The current direction is UP, which means the snake is moving upward.\n\nIf I continue moving UP, the snake's head will move to position (2,3), which contains an apple (A). This is a good move because:\n1. It won't cause the snake to hit a wall\n2. It won't cause the snake to hit itself (the snake currently has no body, just the head)\n3. It will allow the snake to eat an apple, gaining a point and growing in length\n\nSo moving UP seems like a good choice. Let me check other options:\n\n- DOWN: The space below is empty, so this is a safe move but doesn't lead to any immediate reward.\n- LEFT: The space to the left also has an apple, so this is another good option that would result in eating an apple.\n- RIGHT: The space to the right is empty, so this is a safe move but doesn't lead to any immediate reward.\n\nSince both UP and LEFT lead to apples, I need to decide which is better. In this case, I'll continue with UP since that's the current direction and it leads to an apple, making it the most straightforward choice.\n\nActually, wait. Let me think more carefully. I'm misreading the board. Let me re-analyze:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n# AH   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (3,3). \n- If I move UP, I'll go to position (2,3), which doesn't have an apple.\n- If I move LEFT, I'll go to position (3,2), which has an apple (A).\n- If I move RIGHT, I'll go to position (3,4), which doesn't have an apple.\n- If I move DOWN, I'll go to position (4,3), which doesn't have an apple.\n\nSo, moving LEFT seems to be the best option as it will allow the snake to eat an apple.\n\nBut wait, I'm still not reading the board correctly. Let me carefully trace the positions:\n\n```\n########  <- Row 0 (Wall)\n#      #  <- Row 1\n#A     #  <- Row 2\n# AH   #  <- Row 3\n#      #  <- Row 4\n#      #  <- Row 5\n#   A  #  <- Row 6\n########  <- Row 7 (Wall)\n```\n\nAnd for columns:\n```\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n# # # # # # # #  <- Row 0 (Wall)\n# . . . . . . #  <- Row 1\n# A . . . . . #  <- Row 2\n# . A H . . . #  <- Row 3\n# . . . . . . #  <- Row 4\n# . . . . . . #  <- Row 5\n# . . . A . . #  <- Row 6\n# # # # # # # #  <- Row 7 (Wall)\n```\n\nSo the snake's head (H) is at position (3,3).\n- If I move UP, I'll go to position (2,3), which doesn't have an apple.\n- If I move LEFT, I'll go to position (3,2), which has an apple (A).\n- If I move RIGHT, I'll go to position (3,4), which doesn't have an apple.\n- If I move DOWN, I'll go to position (4,3), which doesn't have an apple.\n\nSo, moving LEFT is the best option as it will allow the snake to eat an apple.\n\nWait, let's be extra careful and use clearer notation. If we index from 0 and use (row, column) notation:\n\n```\n(0,0)(0,1)(0,2)(0,3)(0,4)(0,5)(0,6)(0,7)\n(1,0)(1,1)(1,2)(1,3)(1,4)(1,5)(1,6)(1,7)\n(2,0)(2,1)(2,2)(2,3)(2,4)(2,5)(2,6)(2,7)\n(3,0)(3,1)(3,2)(3,3)(3,4)(3,5)(3,6)(3,7)\n(4,0)(4,1)(4,2)(4,3)(4,4)(4,5)(4,6)(4,7)\n(5,0)(5,1)(5,2)(5,3)(5,4)(5,5)(5,6)(5,7)\n(6,0)(6,1)(6,2)(6,3)(6,4)(6,5)(6,6)(6,7)\n(7,0)(7,1)(7,2)(7,3)(7,4)(7,5)(7,6)(7,7)\n```\n\nNow, let's place the objects:\n- Walls (#) are at positions (i,0), (i,7), (0,j), and (7,j) for all valid i and j\n- Snake's head (H) is at position (3,3)\n- Apples (A) are at positions (2,1), (3,2), and (6,3)\n\nSo:\n- If I move UP, I'll go to position (2,3), which doesn't have an apple.\n- If I move LEFT, I'll go to position (3,2), which has an apple (A).\n- If I move RIGHT, I'll go to position (3,4), which doesn't have an apple.\n- If I move DOWN, I'll go to position (4,3), which doesn't have an apple.\n\nMoving LEFT is indeed the best option as it will allow the snake to eat an apple.\n\nHowever, there's one more factor to consider. The problem statement says the snake \"cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\" \n\nThe current direction is UP. Moving LEFT is a 90-degree turn from UP, which is allowed. Moving RIGHT is also a 90-degree turn from UP, which is allowed. Moving DOWN would be a 180-degree turn from UP, which is not allowed.\n\nSo, considering all factors, moving LEFT is still the best option since it allows the snake to eat an apple and is a valid move given the current direction.\n\nSo my answer is: LEFT\n\nThat's my final decision.Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n# AH   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nLooking at the current game board, I can see:\n- The snake's head (H) is at position (3,3)\n- There's an apple (A) immediately to the left of the head at (3,2)\n- Other apples are at positions (2,1) and (6,3)\n- Current direction is UP\n\nSince the snake is currently moving UP, I have three valid options: LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP. I cannot go DOWN as that would be reversing direction.\n\nMoving LEFT will immediately allow me to eat an apple, which will increase my score and grow the snake. This is clearly the best move as I can collect a reward right away.\n\nMoving UP or RIGHT would not immediately reach any apples.\n\nTherefore, I choose to move LEFT to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Let's understand the current game state:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n# HS   #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\n- The snake's head (H) is in the third row.\n- The snake's body (S) is to the right of the head, indicating the snake is moving LEFT.\n- There are 3 apples (A): one in the top left area, one in the middle right, and one in the bottom right.\n- The current direction is LEFT.\n\nNow, I need to decide which direction to move the snake. Let's consider the options:\n\n1. LEFT: This would continue the snake in its current direction. The head would move to the left of its current position. There's no apple there, so it would just move. This movement is safe because there's no wall directly to the left.\n\n2. RIGHT: This would reverse the snake's direction, which is not allowed according to the rules. So, I can't move RIGHT.\n\n3. UP: This would turn the snake upward from its current position. There's no apple, wall, or snake body in the way, so this movement is safe.\n\n4. DOWN: This would turn the snake downward. There's no apple, wall, or snake body in the way, so this movement is also safe.\n\nI want to eat apples to increase my score. Looking at the board, I can see that if I go LEFT, I'll move closer to the wall. If I go UP, I'll move towards the apple in the top left. If I go DOWN, I'll move towards the apple in the middle right and eventually be able to get to the apple in the bottom right.\n\nGiven these considerations, moving UP seems to be the best choice to move towards the apple.\n\nSo, my answer is UP.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. If I go UP from the current position, I'll be going towards the apple in the top left. Let's trace the path visually:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n# HS   #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nIf I go UP, the snake will move one position up, and the board would look like:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n#H     #\n# S A  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nGoing UP doesn't immediately get me to the apple.\n\nLet's re-evaluate: If I continue moving LEFT, I'll get closer to the apple in the top left, and that seems to be the most direct path to an apple. \n\nSo, I think the best choice is to continue moving LEFT.\n\nWait, let me trace the path more carefully.\n\nCurrent board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n# HS   #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nIf I go LEFT, the snake's head will move one position to the left, and the snake's body will extend to where the head was:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n#H S   #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nIf I go LEFT again, I'll continue moving towards the apple in the top left, and the board would look like:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\nH  S   #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nAnd one more step LEFT will hit the wall, ending the game.\n\nSo, moving LEFT is not the best option as it leads to a quick game over. Let's reconsider.\n\nIf I go UP:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#AH    #\n# S    #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nAnd if I go UP again, I'll hit the wall. So UP is also not a great option.\n\nIf I go DOWN:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n#  S   #\n#H  A  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nFrom here, I can move LEFT and eventually reach the bottom-right apple.\n\nGiven these pathways, moving DOWN seems to be the best option for now.\n\nActually, looking at my trace again, I got confused. Let me again carfully look at the board:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n# HS   #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head (H) is adjacent to its body (S). The current direction is LEFT, which means the snake was moving to the left. Let me trace the movement more carefully:\n\nIf I continue moving LEFT:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n#HS    #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nThis is fine; I move closer to the wall.\n\nIf I go UP from the current position:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#AH    #\n# S    #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nI need to be really careful. Let's re-read the board:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n# HS   #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at the third row, second column. The body (S) is to the right of the head, indicating the snake is moving from right to left (i.e., current direction is LEFT).\n\nOkay, given the current board:\n\nIf I continue moving LEFT (the current direction):\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n#HS    #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nI'm moving closer to the wall, but I'm not immediately in danger.\n\nIf I move UP:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#AH    #\n# S    #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nThis will get me closer to the apple in the top left, which is good.\n\nIf I move DOWN:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n# S    #\n#H  A  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nThis will get me closer to the apple in the middle right.\n\nHmm, there are valid reasons to go UP or DOWN. Moving UP gets me to an apple faster, but then I'll be in the corner, which might not be ideal. Moving DOWN gives me more room to maneuver, I am closer to other apples, so it has more potential for the future.\n\nI think I'll choose to move DOWN, as it offers more strategic opportunities for later movements.\n\nWait, let me visualize the board and the aftermath of each move once more:\n\nCurrent board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n# HS   #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nIf I continue moving LEFT (current direction):\nIn the next state, the head (H) would be at the third row, first column, and the body (S) would be at the third row, second column. But there's a wall to the left of that, so if I continue for another move after that, I'd hit the wall and the game would end.\n\nIf I move UP:\nIn the next state, the head (H) would be at the second row, second column, and the body (S) would be at the third row, second column. From there, I could move LEFT to get to the apple in the top left.\n\nIf I move DOWN:\nIn the next state, the head (H) would be at the fourth row, second column, and the body (S) would be at the third row, second column.\n\nOK, I've re-evaluated, and I'd like to change my answer considering the immediate benefits and future potential.\n\nMoving UP will get me closer to the apple in the top left, and I can then move LEFT to get it. While it does put me in a corner, I would get a quick apple, which increases my score.\n\nMoving DOWN allows me to approach the middle and bottom right apples, potentially allowing me to eat more apples in the future.\n\nGiven that the score is based on how many apples are eaten, I'll choose the path that gets me to an apple faster. Moving UP and then LEFT to get to the top-left apple seems to be the most direct path to an immediate score increase.\n\nIn summary, my answer is UP.I'll analyze the current game board:\n\nGame board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n# HS   #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 3\n\nLooking at the board, I can see that:\n- The snake's head (H) is in the third row with a body segment (S) to its right\n- The snake is currently moving LEFT\n- There are 3 apples: one in the top left area, one in the middle right, and one in the bottom right\n\nI need to decide which direction to move:\n1. LEFT: This would continue in the current direction, but I'll quickly approach the wall\n2. RIGHT: Not allowed as it would reverse direction\n3. UP: This would move toward the apple in the top left\n4. DOWN: This would move toward the center of the board where I can access the other apples\n\nIf I move UP, I can then move LEFT to get to the apple in the top left corner. This seems like the most efficient path to get an apple quickly and increase my score.\n\nAnswer: UP","Let me first understand the current state of the game:\n\n- The game board is of size 8x8 and enclosed by walls ('#').\n- The snake's head ('H') is at position (2,2) (row, column, 0-indexed).\n- The snake has a body segment ('S') at position (3,2).\n- There are 3 apples ('A') on the board:\n  - One at position (2,1)\n  - One at position (4,4)\n  - One at position (6,4)\n- The current direction of the snake is UP.\n- We are at epoch 4 of the game.\n\nThe task is to decide the next direction for the snake. The possible directions are 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP', or 'DOWN'.\n\nLet's consider the options:\n1. UP: If the snake moves UP, it will hit the wall on the next move. This will end the game, so it's not a good choice.\n2. DOWN: If the snake moves DOWN, it will move to the position of its own body and collide with itself. This will also end the game, so it's not a good choice.\n3. LEFT: If the snake moves LEFT, it will eat an apple at position (2,1), grow in length, and increase the score by 1. This is a good choice.\n4. RIGHT: If the snake moves RIGHT, it will move to an empty space, which is safe but doesn't increase the score.\n\nGiven these options, the best choice would be to move 'LEFT' to eat the apple and increase the score.\n\nLet me double check. \n\nThe snake's head is at position (2,2), and the body segment is at position (3,2). If the snake moves UP, it will go to position (1,2), which doesn't have a wall.\n\nLet's try to visualize the board again with coordinates to make sure:\n\n```\n    01234567\n   ########\n0  #      #\n1  #AH    #\n2  # S    #\n3  #   A  #\n4  #      #\n5  #   A  #\n6  ########\n```\n\nOh, I mixed up the row and column. Let's try again with correct orientation:\n\n```\n    01234567\n0  ########\n1  #      #\n2  #AH    #\n3  # S    #\n4  #   A  #\n5  #      #\n6  #   A  #\n7  ########\n```\n\nSo the snake's head ('H') is at position (2,2), and the body segment ('S') is at position (3,2). Let's consider the options again:\n\n1. UP: If the snake moves UP, it will go to position (1,2), which is an empty space. This is safe.\n2. DOWN: If the snake moves DOWN, it will go to position (3,2), which is occupied by its own body. This will result in a collision and end the game, so it's not a good choice.\n3. LEFT: If the snake moves LEFT, it will go to position (2,1), which is occupied by an apple. It will eat the apple, grow in length, and increase the score by 1. This is a good choice.\n4. RIGHT: If the snake moves RIGHT, it will go to position (2,3), which is an empty space. This is safe.\n\nLet's correct my visualization one more time, starting with (0,0) at the top-left:\n\n```\n    01234567\n0  ########\n1  #      #\n2  #AH    #\n3  # S    #\n4  #   A  #\n5  #      #\n6  #   A  #\n7  ########\n```\n\nNow I can see more clearly:\n\n- The snake's head ('H') is at position (2,2).\n- The snake has a body segment ('S') at position (3,1).\n- There are 3 apples ('A') on the board:\n  - One at position (2,1)\n  - One at position (4,4)\n  - One at position (6,4)\n- The current direction of the snake is UP.\n\nHmm, let me look at the original board again. Here it is:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#AH    #\n# S    #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nBased on this, I can see:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at position (2,2) (row 2, column 2, 0-indexed).\n- The snake has a body segment ('S') at position (3,1) (row 3, column 1, 0-indexed).\n- There are 3 apples ('A') on the board:\n  - One at position (2,1) (row 2, column 1, 0-indexed).\n  - One at position (4,4) (row 4, column 4, 0-indexed).\n  - One at position (6,4) (row 6, column 4, 0-indexed).\n\nLet's consider the options again:\n1. UP: If the snake moves UP, it will go to position (1,2), which is an empty space. This is safe.\n2. DOWN: If the snake moves DOWN, it will go to position (3,2), which is an empty space. This is safe.\n3. LEFT: If the snake moves LEFT, it will go to position (2,1), which is occupied by an apple. It will eat the apple, grow in length, and increase the score by 1. This is a good choice.\n4. RIGHT: If the snake moves RIGHT, it will go to position (2,3), which is an empty space. This is safe.\n\nGiven these options, the best choice would be to move 'LEFT' to eat the apple and increase the score.\n\nLet's review the rules again just to make sure we're making the right decision:\n\n- The snake can't reverse its direction. The current direction is UP, so the snake can't move DOWN directly.\n- The snake loses if it collides with itself or the walls. Moving LEFT, UP, or RIGHT won't result in a collision.\n- If the snake eats an apple, it grows in length. There's an apple at position (2,1), which the snake can eat by moving LEFT.\n\nI think moving 'LEFT' is the best choice here. Let's finalize our answer.\n\nActually, let me double check the board more carefully. Here is the original board again:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#AH    #\n# S    #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nIf I count from 0 (top-left):\n- Row 0: ########\n- Row 1: #      #\n- Row 2: #AH    #\n- Row 3: # S    #\n- Row 4: #   A  #\n- Row 5: #      #\n- Row 6: #   A  #\n- Row 7: ########\n\nColumn 0: #######\nColumn 1: # AH # #\nColumn 2: #  S   #\n...\n\nNow I can see:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at position (2,2) (row 2, column 2, 0-indexed).\n- The snake has a body segment ('S') at position (3,2) (row 3, column 2, 0-indexed).\n- There are 3 apples ('A') on the board:\n  - One at position (2,1) (row 2, column 1, 0-indexed).\n  - One at position (4,4) (row 4, column 4, 0-indexed).\n  - One at position (6,4) (row 6, column 4, 0-indexed).\n\nHmm, let me double check once more by counting rows and columns explicitly:\n\n```\n    01234567\n0  ########\n1  #      #\n2  #AH    #\n3  # S    #\n4  #   A  #\n5  #      #\n6  #   A  #\n7  ########\n```\n\nH is at (2, 2), S is at (3, 2), and there's an A at (2, 1).\n\nLet's consider the options again:\n1. UP: If the snake moves UP, it will go to position (1,2), which is an empty space. This is safe.\n2. DOWN: If the snake moves DOWN, it will go to position (3,2), which is occupied by its own body. This will result in a collision and end the game, so it's not a good choice.\n3. LEFT: If the snake moves LEFT, it will go to position (2,1), which is occupied by an apple. It will eat the apple, grow in length, and increase the score by 1. This is a good choice.\n4. RIGHT: If the snake moves RIGHT, it will go to position (2,3), which is an empty space. This is safe.\n\nThe snake's current direction is UP. The rules state that \"The snake cannot reverse its direction\". Since the snake is moving UP, it can't move DOWN directly. The available directions are UP, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\nGiven these constraints, if we choose to move LEFT, the snake will eat an apple, grow in length, and increase the score by 1. This is the best choice.\n\nActually, let me clarify once more. The board states  we're in\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#AH    #\n# S    #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nAnd the current direction is UP.\n\nLet me reason about the last move more carefully. If the current direction is UP, and the position of the head ('H') is at (2,2), then the head has moved up from the previous position (3,2). But there's a body segment ('S') at (3,2) now, which means the snake was longer in the previous step or has grown after eating an apple.\n\nGiven that the current direction is UP and we can't reverse to DOWN, our options are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue moving UP.\n\nIf we move LEFT, the snake will eat an apple and grow longer.\nIf we move UP, the snake will move to an empty space.\nIf we move RIGHT, the snake will move to an empty space.\n\nThe best choice would be to move LEFT to eat the apple and increase the score. Moving forward, the position of the head will be (2,1) and a new body segment will be at (2,2) (the current position of the head).\n\nActually, there's something I'm not sure about. Let's try to visualize the outcome of moving LEFT:\n\nIf the snake's head moves from (2,2) to (2,1), and the snake grows in length after eating the apple, a new body segment would be at (2,2) (the current position of the head). The old body segment that was at (3,2) will remain. So, the new board will be:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#HS    #\n# S    #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nThis looks correct. The snake has grown by one, moving the head to the position where the apple was. The body segments follow.\n\nI choose to move 'LEFT' for the snake.Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#AH    #\n# S    #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nI need to decide the best move for the snake. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. The snake's head (H) is at position (2,2)\n2. There's a body segment (S) at position (3,2)\n3. There's an apple (A) right next to the head at position (2,1)\n4. The current direction is UP\n\nSince the snake can't reverse direction (can't go DOWN as it's currently moving UP), my options are:\n- Continue moving UP (to an empty space)\n- Turn LEFT (to eat an apple)\n- Turn RIGHT (to an empty space)\n\nThe best strategy is to eat the apple that's immediately adjacent to the snake's head. If I move LEFT, the snake will eat the apple at (2,1), grow in length, and increase the score by 1.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","HTTPError 529: {\"error\":{\"message\":\"-4316: Overloaded\",\"code\":\"-4307\"}}"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n#   A  #\n#SS    #\n#SH    #\n#      #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 4\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The goal of the game is to control the snake, eat as many apples as possible, and grow the snake in length. Each time the snake eats an apple, the score increases by one. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point. The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n#   A  #\n#SS    #\n#SH    #\n#      #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 5\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n"],"action":"UP","response":["Let me analyze the game board:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#AAH   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4, 3) (row 4, column 3), and the current direction is UP.\n\nTo determine my next move, I need to consider:\n1. Avoiding walls (which are at the edges, marked by #)\n2. Collecting apples (marked by A)\n3. Avoiding collision with the snake's own body (marked by S), although right now the snake is just a head\n\nThe available apples are:\n- At position (4, 1) - the leftmost A in row 4\n- At position (4, 2) - the middle A in row 4\n- At position (3, 4) - the A in row 3\n\nSince the current direction is UP, the snake is moving from its current position (4, 3) to (3, 3). This doesn't lead to an apple.\n\nThe possible directions I can choose are:\n- UP (continue in the current direction)\n- LEFT (turn left)\n- RIGHT (turn right)\n- DOWN is not allowed as it would be a direct reversal from the current UP direction\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n- UP: Would move to (3, 3), which doesn't have an apple.\n- LEFT: Would move to (4, 2), which has an apple. This would immediately increase the score.\n- RIGHT: Would move to (4, 4), which doesn't have an apple.\n\nSince LEFT leads to an apple, that seems like the best choice. Moving LEFT would allow the snake to eat the apple at (4, 2), increase the score by 1, and grow the snake's length.\n\nSo my answer is LEFT.I'll analyze the current game board:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#AAH   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4, 3), and the current direction is UP. I can see three apples on the board:\n- One apple at (3, 4)\n- Two apples at (4, 1) and (4, 2), which are directly to the left of the snake's head\n\nSince the snake is currently moving UP, I have three valid options: continue moving UP, turn LEFT, or turn RIGHT. I cannot go DOWN as that would be a direct reversal of the current direction.\n\nIf I move LEFT, I will immediately eat the apple at (4, 2). This is the most efficient move to increase my score right away. Moving UP or RIGHT wouldn't immediately result in eating an apple.\n\nTherefore, my best move is to turn LEFT to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Let me analyze the game board first:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#AHS   #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head (H) is currently at position (4, 2) (assuming 0-indexed, with (0, 0) being the top-left corner). The snake's body (S) is at position (4, 3). There are three apples (A) on the board: at positions (4, 1), (3, 4), and (5, 1).\n\nThe current direction of the snake is LEFT, which means the snake is moving from right to left.\n\nAccording to the rules, the snake cannot reverse its direction. Since the current direction is LEFT, I cannot choose RIGHT as my next move.\n\nLet's analyze the possible moves:\n1. Continue LEFT: The snake's head would move to position (4, 1), where there's an apple. This would be a good move as the snake would eat an apple and grow.\n2. Turn UP: The snake's head would move to position (3, 2). There's nothing there, so the snake would just move.\n3. Turn DOWN: The snake's head would move to position (5, 2). There's nothing there, so the snake would just move.\n\nSince there's an apple at position (4, 1), moving LEFT seems to be the best choice as it would allow the snake to eat an apple and grow.\n\nSo, my answer is to move LEFT.\n\nActually, let me double-check this. In the board, the snake's head 'H' is at (4, 2) and the body 'S' is at (4, 3). The current direction is LEFT, which means the snake is moving from right to left, which is consistent with the head being to the left of the body.\n\nNow, let's reconsider the positions of the apples. The first apple is at (4, 1), to the left of the head, the second apple is at (3, 4), and the third apple is at (5, 1). \n\nIf the snake moves LEFT, it would go to position (4, 1), which contains an apple. This would be a good move.\nIf the snake moves UP, it would go to position (3, 2), which is an empty space.\nIf the snake moves DOWN, it would go to position (5, 2), which is an empty space.\n\nSince there's an apple at position (4, 1), moving LEFT is the best choice. \n\nActually, let me re-analyze the board again, this time using a different coordinate system. Let's use row, column notation, starting from the top-left corner as (1, 1).\n\n```\n(1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (1,8)   # Row 1\n(2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6) (2,7) (2,8)   # Row 2\n(3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6) (3,7) (3,8)   # Row 3\n(4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6) (4,7) (4,8)   # Row 4\n(5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (5,7) (5,8)   # Row 5\n(6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (6,7) (6,8)   # Row 6\n(7,1) (7,2) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) (7,8)   # Row 7\n(8,1) (8,2) (8,3) (8,4) (8,5) (8,6) (8,7) (8,8)   # Row 8\n```\n\nAnd the board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#AHS   #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nSo in this coordinate system:\n- The snake's head (H) is at position (5, 2)\n- The snake's body (S) is at position (5, 3)\n- The apples (A) are at positions (5, 1), (4, 4), and (6, 2)\n\nGiven that the current direction is LEFT, the snake is moving from right to left. If I move the snake LEFT, it would go to position (5, 1), which contains an apple. This would be a good move. \n\nIf I move the snake UP, it would go to position (4, 2), which is an empty space. \n\nIf I move the snake DOWN, it would go to position (6, 2), which also contains an apple. This would also be a good move.\n\nSo there are two good options: LEFT and DOWN. Since there's an apple at both positions (5, 1) and (6, 2), both LEFT and DOWN would allow the snake to eat an apple and grow.\n\nActually, let me be even more precise about the board, using the ASCII representation:\n\n```\n######## (Row 0)\n#      # (Row 1)\n#      # (Row 2)\n#   A  # (Row 3)\n#AHS   # (Row 4)\n# A    # (Row 5)\n#      # (Row 6)\n######## (Row 7)\n```\n\nSo in this, the snake's head (H) is at position (4, 2), the snake's body (S) is at position (4, 3), and the apples (A) are at positions (4, 1), (3, 4), and (5, 1).\n\nGiven that the current direction is LEFT, the snake is moving from right to left. If I move the snake LEFT, it would go to position (4, 1), which contains an apple. This would be a good move.\n\nIf I move the snake UP, it would go to position (3, 2), which is an empty space.\n\nIf I move the snake DOWN, it would go to position (5, 2), which contains an apple. This would also be a good move.\n\nSo there are two good options: LEFT and DOWN. Since there's an apple at both positions (4, 1) and (5, 1), both LEFT and DOWN would allow the snake to eat an apple and grow.\n\nActually, (5, 1) does not contain an apple.\n\nLet me re-analyze, treating rows from 0-7 and cols from 0-7:\n\n```\n01234567\n0######## \n1#      #\n2#      #\n3#   A  #\n4#AHS   #\n5# A    #\n6#      #\n7########\n```\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4, 2). The snake's body (S) is at position (4, 3). The apples (A) are at positions (4, 1), (3, 4), and (5, 1).\n\nThe current direction is LEFT. This means the snake's head is moving left, which is consistent with the head being to the left of the body.\n\nIf I move LEFT, the snake's head would go to position (4, 1), which contains an apple. This would be a good move.\n\nIf I move UP, the snake's head would go to position (3, 2), which is an empty space.\n\nIf I move DOWN, the snake's head would go to position (5, 2), which doesn't contain an apple, but the apple is at position (5, 1), not (5, 2). So, moving DOWN wouldn't immediately lead to eating an apple.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT is the best choice, as it would allow the snake to eat an apple.\n\nLet me check the board one more time:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#AHS   #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nThe head 'H' is at the 5th row, 3rd column (0-indexed: (4, 2)).\nTo the left of the head, there is an apple 'A' at position (4, 1).\nTo the right of the head, there is a body segment 'S' at position (4, 3).\nThe other apples are at positions (3, 4) and (5, 1).\n\nGiven that the current direction is LEFT, moving LEFT would lead to the apple at position (4, 1). So, LEFT is the best move.\n\nActually, let's use a coordinate system where I don't convert to 0-indexed, just to be super-clear. Let the first row and column both be labeled as 1. Then I have:\n\n```\n 12345678\n1########\n2#      #\n3#      #\n4#   A  #\n5#AHS   #\n6# A    #\n7#      #\n8########\n```\n\nThe head 'H' is at position (5, 3).\nThe body 'S' is at position (5, 4).\nThe apples 'A' are at positions (5, 2), (4, 5), and (6, 2).\n\nIf I move LEFT, the snake's head would go to position (5, 2), which contains an apple.\nIf I move UP, the snake's head would go to position (4, 3), which doesn't contain an apple.\nIf I move DOWN, the snake's head would go to position (6, 3), which doesn't contain an apple.\n\nSo, the best move is LEFT, which would allow the snake to eat an apple at position (5, 2).\n\nI've analyzed the board multiple times, and I'm confident that LEFT is the best move.\n\nThus, my final answer is:\n\nLEFTGame board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#AHS   #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nLooking at the game board, I can see:\n- The snake's head (H) is at position (4, 2)\n- The snake has one body segment (S) at position (4, 3)\n- There are three apples (A) on the board at positions (4, 1), (3, 4), and (5, 1)\n- The current direction is LEFT\n\nGiven that the current direction is LEFT, I have three possible moves:\n1. Continue moving LEFT\n2. Turn UP\n3. Turn DOWN\n\nSince the snake cannot reverse its direction, I cannot choose RIGHT.\n\nIf I move LEFT, the snake's head will move to position (4, 1), which contains an apple. This would allow the snake to eat the apple, grow in length, and increase the score by 1.\n\nIf I move UP or DOWN, the snake would just move to an empty space without eating an apple.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to continue moving LEFT to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Let me understand the game state:\n\n- The snake's head (H) is at position (4, 1) (considering 0-based indexing, row 4, column 1)\n- The snake's body (S) extends to the right for 2 segments at positions (4, 2) and (4, 3)\n- There are 3 apples (A) on the board at positions (1, 4), (3, 4), and (5, 2)\n- The current direction is LEFT\n- The current epoch is 3\n\nThe question is: what direction should I choose to move the snake?\n\nSince the snake is currently moving LEFT and cannot reverse direction directly (can't go from LEFT to RIGHT), my options are:\n- LEFT (continue in the same direction)\n- UP (turn upward)\n- DOWN (turn downward)\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n1. LEFT: If I continue moving LEFT, the snake will move to position (4, 0), which is next to the wall. This is risky because in the next move I would hit the wall if I continued going LEFT.\n\n2. UP: If I turn UP, the snake will move to position (3, 1). There's no apple there, but it's a safe move.\n\n3. DOWN: If I turn DOWN, the snake will move to position (5, 1). There's no immediate apple there, but there is an apple at (5, 2), which I could potentially reach in a future move if I turn RIGHT after going DOWN.\n\nGiven these options, I think going UP is the safest choice. It moves the snake away from the wall and gives me more options for future moves. Going DOWN could help me reach an apple, but I'd need to make a turn afterward.\n\nI'll choose UP as my answer.\n\nActually, let me re-check this. I need to be careful about the coordinate system. Let me double-check my understanding of the board:\n\n```\n########  (0, 0) to (0, 7)\n#   A  #  (1, 0) to (1, 7)\n#      #  (2, 0) to (2, 7)\n#   A  #  (3, 0) to (3, 7)\n#HSS   #  (4, 0) to (4, 7)\n# A    #  (5, 0) to (5, 7)\n#      #  (6, 0) to (6, 7)\n########  (7, 0) to (7, 7)\n```\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4, 1), and the snake is moving LEFT. So in the next move, the head will be at (4, 0) if I continue LEFT, which would make the snake hit the wall.\n\nIf I go UP, the head will be at (3, 1), which is a safe move.\n\nIf I go DOWN, the head will be at (5, 1), which is also safe and would position me to potentially get the apple at (5, 2) in a future move.\n\nI think UP is the best move, as it moves away from the wall and provides more options for future moves.\n\nWait, let me re-check the coordinate system once more. In many programming contexts, the top-left corner is (0, 0), with row indices increasing as you move down and column indices increasing as you move right.\n\nSo the actual board with coordinates (row, col) would be:\n```\n######## (0, 0) to (0, 7)\n#   A  # (1, 0) to (1, 7)\n#      # (2, 0) to (2, 7)\n#   A  # (3, 0) to (3, 7)\n#HSS   # (4, 0) to (4, 7)\n# A    # (5, 0) to (5, 7)\n#      # (6, 0) to (6, 7)\n######## (7, 0) to (7, 7)\n```\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at (4, 1), and the body (S) extends to (4, 2) and (4, 3).\n\nLet me recheck my move options:\n\n1. LEFT: The head would move to (4, 0), which is just beside the wall. If I continued LEFT in the next move, I would hit the wall.\n\n2. UP: The head would move to (3, 1), which is a safe move. There's no apple there, but it positions me to potentially reach the apple at (3, 4) in future moves.\n\n3. DOWN: The head would move to (5, 1), which is next to an apple at (5, 2). This could be a good move if I plan to turn RIGHT after moving DOWN.\n\nGiven the options, I'm leaning towards DOWN as the best move. It positions me to potentially get an apple at (5, 2) in the next move or two.\n\nBut let me think this through more carefully. \n\nIf I go DOWN, my head moves to (5, 1). In the next move, I could go LEFT (and be adjacent to the wall), RIGHT (towards the apple at (5, 2)), or DOWN (towards the bottom of the board).\n\nIf I go UP, my head moves to (3, 1). In the next move, I could go LEFT (and be adjacent to the wall), RIGHT (away from the wall), or UP (towards the top of the board, where there's an apple at (1, 4)).\n\nI think DOWN is the better move because it positions me to potentially get an apple at (5, 2) in the next move or two. After getting that apple, I could continue moving towards the other apples.\n\nActually, let me visualize what happens after I move:\n\nIf I go LEFT, the snake's head moves to (4, 0), and the body will be at (4, 1) and (4, 2) (the tail at (4, 3) disappears). I'll be next to the wall, which is risky.\n\nIf I go UP, the snake's head moves to (3, 1), and the body will be at (4, 1) and (4, 2). This puts me in a position to potentially head towards the apple at (3, 4).\n\nIf I go DOWN, the snake's head moves to (5, 1), and the body will be at (4, 1) and (4, 2). This puts me right next to the apple at (5, 2), which I could get in the next move by going RIGHT.\n\nGiven these options, I think DOWN is the best move. It positions me to get an apple in the next move or two, which will increase my score.\n\nActually, let me re-check where the apple is. Let's re-read through the board:\n\n```\n########\n#   A  #  The apple is at (1, 4)\n#      #\n#   A  #  The apple is at (3, 4)\n#HSS   #  The snake's head is at (4, 1), with body at (4, 2) and (4, 3)\n# A    #  The apple is at (5, 2)\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nAh, now I see the confusion. The apple at the row below the snake is at (5, 2), not (5, 1).\n\nSo if I go DOWN, my head will be at (5, 1), which is right next to the apple at (5, 2). In the next move, I could go RIGHT to get the apple.\n\nIf I go UP, my head will be at (3, 1), which is 3 steps away from the apple at (3, 4) (I would need to go RIGHT three times after going UP).\n\nIf I go LEFT, my head will be at (4, 0), which is adjacent to the wall, and I'd be in a risky position.\n\nGiven these options, I think going DOWN is the best choice. It positions me to get an apple in the next move by going RIGHT, which will increase my score.\n\nIn conclusion, I will choose DOWN as my final answer, but let me actually visualize what would happen in the next few steps properly. (By the way at first I misinterpreted the row and column, let me clarify that I am using 0-based indexing, and that rows go from top to bottom, while columns go from left to right so that (0,0) is the top-left corner.)\n\nCurrent board (with coordinate grid overlaid)\n```\n    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n   ----------------\n0 | # # # # # # # #\n1 | # . . .

LEFT: Head moves to (4, 0), which is next to the wall. This is risky.\n   ```\n       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n      ----------------\n   0 | # # # # # # # #\n   1 | # . . .

UP: Head moves to (3, 1), which is a safe move.\n   ```\n       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n      ----------------\n   0 | # # # # # # # #\n   1 | # . . . A . . #\n   2 | # . . . . . . #\n   3 | # H . .

A . . . . #\n   6 | # . . . . . . #\n   7 | # # # # # # # #\n   ```\n   From this position, I can continue UP, go LEFT (risky), or go RIGHT (towards the apple at (3, 4)).\n\n3. DOWN: Head moves to (5, 1), which is a safe move.\n   ```\n       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n      ----------------\n   0 | # # # # # # # #\n   1 | # . . . A . . #\n   2 | # . . . . . . #\n   3 | # . . .

This seems like the best option to quickly eat an apple. However, the apple at (3, 4) is a bit farther and would require more moves to reach.\n\nDown seems like the best direction because it positions me to eat an apple in the next move by turning RIGHT.\n\nFinal answer: DOWNGame board:\n```\n########\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#HSS   #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nI'll analyze the current game situation:\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4,1) with body segments (S) at (4,2) and (4,3). The snake is currently moving LEFT. There are three apples (A) on the board at positions (1,4), (3,4), and (5,2).\n\nSince the snake is currently moving LEFT, I can either continue in that direction or turn UP or DOWN. I cannot reverse direction directly to RIGHT.\n\nMy options:\n1. LEFT: This would put me at (4,0), right next to the wall, which is risky.\n2. UP: This would move me to (3,1), which is safe but not near any apples.\n3. DOWN: This would move me to (5,1), which positions me right next to the apple at (5,2). From there, I could turn RIGHT in the next move to eat that apple.\n\nThe best choice is to move DOWN, which keeps me safe and positions me to eat an apple in the next move by turning RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Let me first understand the current state of the game:\n\nGame board:\n```\n########\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#SS    #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 4\n\nIn this state:\n- The snake's head is at 'H' (which is at the 6th row, 2nd column).\n- The snake's body is represented by 'S' characters. There are two body segments at the 5th row, 1st and 2nd columns.\n- There are 3 apples ('A') on the board: one at the 2nd row, 5th column, one at the 4th row, 5th column, and one at the 6th row, 3rd column.\n- The snake is currently moving DOWN.\n\nI need to decide what direction to move the snake to maximize the score (by eating apples) while avoiding collisions.\n\nThe snake cannot go in the opposite direction of its current direction. Since the current direction is DOWN, I cannot go UP.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n1. Continue moving DOWN: The snake would move from row 6, column 2 to row 7, column 2. This would not lead to colliding with any apple, wall, or body segment. It's safe but doesn't immediately lead to getting an apple.\n2. Turn LEFT: The snake would move from row 6, column 2 to row 6, column 1. This would not lead to colliding with any wall or body segment, and there's no apple there. It's safe but doesn't lead to getting an apple.\n3. Turn RIGHT: The snake would move from row 6, column 2 to row 6, column 3. This would lead to eating an apple (at row 6, column 3). This is a good option!\n\nLooking at the options, turning RIGHT would be the optimal move as it would allow the snake to eat an apple, increasing the score.\n\nOK, so my answer is RIGHT. But let me double check:\n\nThe snake is at (6, 2) [row, column], and is moving DOWN. If I move RIGHT, the new position is (6, 3). At (6, 3) there's an apple, so the snake will eat it and increase its length by 1. This is a good move that doesn't risk ending the game.\n\nI'll go with RIGHT.Game board:\n```\n########\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#SS    #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nLooking at the game board, I can see:\n- The snake's head (H) is at the 6th row, 2nd column\n- The snake has two body segments (SS) at the 5th row, 1st and 2nd columns\n- There are three apples (A): one at the 2nd row, 5th column; one at the 4th row, 5th column; and one directly to the right of the snake's head at the 6th row, 3rd column\n- The snake is currently moving DOWN\n\nSince I cannot move in the opposite direction of the current direction (UP in this case), my options are:\n1. Continue moving DOWN\n2. Turn LEFT\n3. Turn RIGHT\n\nThe best move is to turn RIGHT because:\n- This will allow me to immediately eat the apple at position (6,3)\n- It avoids any collision with walls or the snake's body\n- It increases my score by 1\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Let's analyze the current game board:\n\n```\n########\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n#   A  #\n#SS    #\n#SH    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nThe snake currently consists of a head 'H' at (5, 2) and body segments 'S' at (5, 1), (4, 1), and (4, 0) (counting from the bottom-left, 0-indexed). The current direction is RIGHT.\n\nIf the snake continues moving RIGHT, it will move to (5, 3) in the next step. There's no apple there, so the snake will just move forward without growing. The tail will move forward as well, resulting in the snake still having a length of 4.\n\nIf the snake turns UP, it will move to (6, 2). There's nothing there either, so the snake just moves forward without growing.\n\nIf the snake turns DOWN, it can't because that would be reversing the current direction, which is not allowed according to the rules.\n\nIf the snake turns LEFT, it can't because that would be reversing the current direction, which is not allowed according to the rules.\n\nSo, the valid moves are RIGHT and UP. Let's see which one is better.\n\nMoving RIGHT makes the snake go towards the center of the board, where there are two apples, one at (4, 6) and one at (2, 1). Moving UP doesn't seem to be heading towards any immediate apples, and potentially could lead to the snake trapping itself.\n\nI think the best move is to continue moving RIGHT, as it keeps the snake moving towards the apples in the center of the board.\n\nActually, let me double-check the positions of the apples and the snake. \n\nThe grid is 8x8, with walls around the edges, so the playable area is 6x6. Let's denote the positions as (row, column), with (0, 0) being the top-left corner of the playable area:\n\n- Apples: (0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 3)\n- Snake: Head at (4, 2), body at (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 0)\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT, the head will go to (4, 3). There's no apple there.\nIf the snake moves UP, the head will go to (5, 2). There's no apple there either.\n\nBoth moves are safe and don't lead to immediate apple consumption. However, moving RIGHT will get the snake closer to an apple at (2, 3). So, I still think RIGHT is the best move.\n\nActually, I'm a bit confused with my coordinate system. Let me clarify the board again:\n\n```\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  (column indices)\n0 ########\n1 #   A  #\n2 # A    #\n3 #   A  #\n4 #SS    #\n5 #SH    #\n6 #      #\n7 ########\n```\n\nSo, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6). \n\n- Apples: (1, 4), (2, 2), (3, 4)\n- Snake: Head at (5, 3), body at (5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1)\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT, the head will go to (5, 4). There's no apple there.\nIf the snake moves UP, the head will go to (6, 3). There's no apple there either.\n\nBoth moves are safe and don't lead to immediate apple consumption.\n\nLet's check which move gets the snake closer to the nearest apple:\n- Distance from (5, 4) to (1, 4): 4 steps\n- Distance from (5, 4) to (2, 2): 5 steps\n- Distance from (5, 4) to (3, 4): 2 steps\n\n- Distance from (6, 3) to (1, 4): 6 steps\n- Distance from (6, 3) to (2, 2): 5 steps\n- Distance from (6, 3) to (3, 4): 4 steps\n\nMoving RIGHT gets the snake closer to the apple at (3, 4), which is the closest apple. So, I still think RIGHT is the best move.\n\nI think I'm still getting confused with the coordinate system. Let's simplify and just focus on the relative positions.\n\nIn the given board, the snake's head 'H' is at the position (5, 3) in a 0-indexed grid. The snake is currently moving RIGHT.\n\nIf the snake continues moving RIGHT, the head will move to (5, 4), which is an empty space. This seems safe.\n\nIf the snake turns UP, the head will move to (4, 3), which is also an empty space.\n\nLooking at the board, there are three apples:\n1. One at (1, 4)\n2. One at (2, 2)\n3. One at (3, 4)\n\nIf the snake continues moving RIGHT, it's moving towards the right side of the board, but there are no apples directly in that path.\n\nIf the snake turns UP, it's moving towards the apples at (3, 4) and (1, 4), which is a more direct path to the apples.\n\nSo, I think the best move is to turn UP.\n\nActually, no, I think my orientation is still wrong. Let me reorient myself using the board provided.\n\n```\n########  <- row 0\n#   A  #  <- row 1\n# A    #  <- row 2\n#   A  #  <- row 3\n#SS    #  <- row 4\n#SH    #  <- row 5\n#      #  <- row 6\n########  <- row 7\n```\n\nSo, assuming the top-left corner is (0, 0), the apples are at:\n1. (1, 4) (top row, near the middle)\n2. (2, 1) (second row, near the left)\n3. (3, 4) (third row, near the middle)\n\nAnd the snake is positioned such that:\n- The head 'H' is at (5, 3) (near the bottom, middle-left)\n- There are body segments 'S' at (5, 2), (4, 2), and (4, 1)\n\nThe snake is currently moving RIGHT. If it continues moving RIGHT, the head will move to (5, 4), which is an empty space.\n\nIf the snake turns UP, the head will move to (4, 3), which is also an empty space.\n\nNow, looking at the apples and the snake's position, if the snake continues moving RIGHT and then possibly UP later, it might approach the apple at (3, 4).\n\nIf the snake turns UP and then RIGHT later, it still might approach the same apple.\n\nBut I think turning UP now provides a bit more flexibility and gives the snake a slightly better position to potentially navigate to all three apples.\n\nSo, my answer is UP. The snake would move to position (4, 3).\n\nActually, let me check the rules one more time. The rule states:\n\n\"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\"\n\nThe snake is currently moving RIGHT, so it can't suddenly move LEFT. But it can move UP or DOWN.\n\nGiven the positions of the apples and the snake, I believe the best move is UP. This will position the snake to potentially reach the apple at (3, 4) by going UP and then RIGHT.\n\nLet me reconsider more carefully. Now I notice that when the snake is facing RIGHT, there's a snake body segment RIGHT BELOW the head. The snake body is curving from the bottom-left, then up, then to the right, and the head is at the rightmost position. This means that the snake body is curving in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\nIf the snake turns UP from here, it will move towards the top of the board, potentially approaching the apple at (3, 4).\n\nIf the snake continues moving RIGHT, it moves away from the coiled body and towards the right side of the board, where there are no immediate apples.\n\nGiven the current positions and the goal of eating apples, I'll stick with my decision: the best move is UP.\n\nLet's actually count the number of steps to reach each apple:\n\nStarting from (5, 3) and moving RIGHT:\n1. (5, 4)\n2. (5, 5)\n3. (5, 6)\n4. (4, 6)\n5. (3, 6)\n6. (2, 6)\n7. (1, 6)\n8. (1, 5)\n9. (1, 4) - First apple\n\nStarting from (5, 3) and moving UP:\n1. (4, 3)\n2. (3, 3)\n3. (3, 4) - Third apple\n\nLooking at the steps, if the snake turns UP, it reaches the third apple in just 3 moves. If it continues moving RIGHT, it doesn't reach any apple in the immediate future.\n\nSo, my answer is UP, and it's a clear choice based on the proximity to apples.\n\nWait, I'm just realizing that there might be a problem here. I'm not sure I've read the board correctly. This is how it looks:\n\n```\n########\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n#   A  #\n#SS    #\n#SH    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nI need to double check the exact snake body shape to ensure I understand the context correctly. the snake body is represented by 'S', while 'H' is the head of the snake. I see that the snake head 'H' is at (5, 3), and there are segments 'S' at (5, 2), (4, 2), and (4, 1).\n\nThis means the snake is coming in from the left, curving up, and now the head is extended to the right. Given that the snake is moving RIGHT, it came from the position (5, 2) where there's a segment 'S'.\n\nIf the snake continues moving RIGHT, the head will move to (5, 4), and the segment 'S' at (4, 1) will disappear, the segment 'S' at (4, 2) will move to (4, 1), the segment 'S' at (5, 2) will move to (4, 2), and a new segment 'S' will appear at (5, 3) where the head currently is.\n\nIf the snake turns UP, the head will move to (4, 3), and a similar shift in segments will occur.\n\nLooking at the board, the closest apple to the snake is at (3, 4), which can be reached by moving UP and then RIGHT. This seems to be the most efficient move in terms of reaching an apple quickly.\n\nSo, my final answer is UP.\n\nWait, I think I may have confused my directions before. Looking at the board:\n\n```\n########\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n#   A  #\n#SS    #\n#SH    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nWhere (0,0) is the top-left, (0,7) is the top right, (7,0) is the bottom left, and (7,7) is the bottom right.\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (5, 3), and the snake is currently moving RIGHT. If the snake continues moving RIGHT, the head will move to (5, 4), which is an empty space.\n\nIf the snake turns UP, the head will move to (4, 3), which has a body segment 'S'. Colliding with the snake's own body would result in a loss, so turning UP is not a valid move.\n\nIf the snake turns DOWN, the head will move to (6, 3), which is an empty space. But since the snake is currently moving RIGHT, moving DOWN would be a 90-degree turn from its current direction, which is allowed.\n\nGiven the constraints and the location of the apples, it seems like the snake should continue moving RIGHT to avoid colliding with its own body. This would lead the snake toward the right side of the board, potentially allowing it to maneuver around to reach the apples in a later turn.\n\nActually, let me clarify my confusion. Let's look at the board again:\n\n```\n########  0\n#   A  #  1\n# A    #  2\n#   A  #  3\n#SS    #  4\n#SH    #  5\n#      #  6\n########  7\n```\n\nI'm designating rows from 0 to 7, going from top to bottom. Columns would be similar, with 0 starting at the left edge.\n\nNow, the snake's head 'H' is at position (5, 3), and there are body segments 'S' at (5, 2), (4, 2), and (4, 1). Crucially, I observe that there's NO body segment at (4, 3); that's an empty cell. Let me re-visualize:\n\n```\n########\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n#   A  #\n#SS    #\n#SH    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nYes, row 4, column 3 is empty. So, if the snake turns UP, it would move to (4, 3), which is a valid move.\n\nI think my initial assessment was correct. The closest apple is at (3, 4), and the best way to get there is to turn UP first, and then RIGHT.\n\nSo, my answer is UP.\n\nActually, I'm still a bit unsure. Let's check the exact positions one by one to ensure I'm reading the board correctly.\n\nIn the board:\n```\n########\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n#   A  #\n#SS    #\n#SH    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nThe positions of the objects are:\n- 'H' (snake head): (5, 3)\n- 'S' (snake body): (5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1)\n- 'A' (apples): (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 4)\n\nIf the snake is currently moving RIGHT (from left to right), then the previous position of the head was (5, 2), where there's now a body segment 'S'.\n\nIf the snake turns UP, the head would move to (4, 3).\nBut in the board, there's no notation at (4, 3). It's an empty space.\n\nThe cells marked 'S' are (5, 2), (4, 2), and (4, 1). None of these corresponds to (4, 3).\n\nWait, let me double check and do some 0-indexed counting again on the visual representation.\n\n```\n01234567 (column indices)\n0########\n1#   A  #\n2# A    #\n3#   A  #\n4#SS    #\n5#SH    #\n6#      #\n7########\n```\n\nSo the snake's head 'H' is at position (5, 3), with body segments 'S' at positions (5, 2), (4, 2), and (4, 1).\n\nThe question now is, can the snake move UP from its current position? That would move the head to (4, 3).\n\nLooking at the board, (4, 3) appears to be an empty space. There's no notation at that position, so it's not a body segment or an apple. Hence, the snake can indeed move UP.\n\nAnd as I've deduced before, moving UP would allow the snake to approach the closest apple, which is at (3, 4), in the most efficient manner.\n\nSo, my answer is UP.\n\nJust to make sure, if I'm reading the board correctly, moving UP should lead the head to a position where there's no 'S'. Specifically, the head would move from (5, 3) to (4, 3).\n\nIn the board:\n```\n01234567 (column indices)\n0########\n1#   A  #\n2# A    #\n3#   A  #\n4#SS    #\n5#SH    #\n6#      #\n7########\n```\n\nRow 4, column 3 is empty. The 'S' body segments are at (5, 2), (4, 2), and (4, 1).\n\nSo yes, moving UP would lead the head to (4, 3), which is an empty space, and not a collision with the snake's own body.\n\nActually, I'm still uncertain due to a lack of clarity in my mental representation of the board. Let's manually count the rows and columns to ensure I correctly identify all positions.\n\nVisual Board:\n```\n  01234567 (column indices)\n0 ########\n1 #   A  #\n2 # A    #\n3 #   A  #\n4 #SS    #\n5 #SH    #\n6 #      #\n7 ########\n```\n\nIf I go to row 4, column 3, I move from the top and go down 4 rows, and from the left and go right 3 columns, so I'd point to the space at the intersection of the 4th row and the 3rd column. In the given board, that's after \"SS\" in the 4th row, which seems to be an empty space, not a snake body segment.\n\nSo, (4, 3) is indeed empty, and moving UP would be valid. And, as I've mentioned, it seems to be the best move to approach the closest apple.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is UP.\n\nOkay, to be absolutely precise, let's count the board from the top-left corner and determine the position of each character.\n\nFor ease, I'll convert the board to:\n```\n01234567 (column indices)\n0########\n1#   A  #\n2# A    #\n3#   A  #\n4#SS    #\n5#SH    #\n6#      #\n7########\n```\n\nLet's check row by row:\n- Row 0: All '#' (wall).\n- Row 1: '#' at (1, 0), 'A' at (1, 4), '#' at (1, 7).\n- Row 2: '#' at (2, 0), 'A' at (2, 2), '#' at (2, 7).\n- Row 3: '#' at (3, 0), 'A' at (3, 4), '#' at (3, 7).\n- Row 4: '#' at (4, 0), 'S' at (4, 1), 'S' at (4, 2), '#' at (4, 7).\n- Row 5: '#' at (5, 0), 'S' at (5, 1), 'H' at (5, 2), '#' at (5, 7).\n- Row 6: '#' at (6, 0), '#' at (6, 7).\n- Row 7: All '#' (wall).\n\nSnake head 'H' is at (5, 2).\nSnake body segments 'S' are at (5, 1), (4, 1), and (4, 2).\nApples 'A' are at (1, 4), (2, 2), and (3, 4).\n\nNow, if the snake is moving to the right (RIGHT direction), the head will move from (5, 2) to (5, 3).\n\nHmm, I'm noticing something. If the snake is moving RIGHT, the head would have come from (5, 1), not from (5, 2). This might mean that the head moved from (5, 1) to (5, 2), and the direction RIGHT might be the result of the snake's last move, not the current direction it's facing.\n\nActually, I am misinterpreting the board again. The game board provides the current state, and the \"Current direction\" indicates the direction the snake is currently moving in.\n\nIn the game board:\n```\n########\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n#   A  #\n#SS    #\n#SH    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (5, 2), and the snake is currently moving RIGHT. This means the head will move to (5, 3) in the next step if it continues in the RIGHT direction.\n\nIf the snake turns UP, the head will move to (4, 2).\nBut position (4, 2) already has a snake body segment 'S'. This would result in the snake colliding with its own body, which is a loss.\n\nWait, let me re-read the board again. Let me count exactly character by character:\n\n```\n########\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n#   A  #\n#SS    #\n#SH    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nLet's count from the top-left:\n- The first 'A' is at the 4th position of the 2nd row.\n- The second 'A' is at the 2nd position of the 3rd row.\n- The third 'A' is at the 4th position of the 4th row.\n- 'S' are at the 2nd and 3rd positions of the 5th row.\n- 'S' and 'H' are at the 2nd and 3rd positions of the 6th row.\n\nSo, the head 'H' is at (6, 3) (6th row, 3rd position).\nThe snake body segments 'S' are at (6, 2), (5, 2), and (5, 3).\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me count again, considering the top-left corner of the actual playable area (excluding the wall) as (1, 1).\n\nSnake head 'H' is at (5, 3).\nSnake body segments 'S' are at:\n- (5, 2)\n- (4, 2)\n- (4, 1)\n\nThis is different from my previous assessment. \n\nOk, I think I need to make sure I'm consistent with a single coordinate system. I'll use (row, column) where (0, 0) is the top-left corner of the entire board (including the wall).\n\nIn this system, the positions are:\n- Snake head 'H': (5, 3)\n- Snake body segments 'S': (5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1)\n- Apples 'A': (1, 4), (2, 2), (3, 4)\n\nIf the snake is moving RIGHT and continues in that direction, the head will move to (5, 4). This is an empty space.\n\nIf the snake turns UP, the head will move to (4, 3). Let's check if there's a snake body segment at (4, 3).\n\nLooking at the positions of the snake body segments 'S', they are at (5, 2), (4, 2), and (4, 1). None of them is at (4, 3). So, (4, 3) is an empty space, and turning UP would not result in a collision with the snake's own body.\n\nTherefore, the snake can turn UP, and as I've deduced earlier, it's a better move in terms of approaching the closest apple at (3, 4).\n\nSo, my answer is UP.\n\nActually, I realize after revisiting my answer again, I don't think I can be 100% sure that there's not a snake body segment at (4, 3), but I'm pretty sure that (4, 3) is indeed emtpy from the board representation above. Let's just verify again.\n\n```\n########\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n#   A  #\n#SS    #\n#SH    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nRow 4 contains \"#SS\" and then what looks like empty spaces. That would mean that there are snake body segments at (4, 1) and (4, 2), but not at (4, 3).\n\nSo I think (4, 3) is indeed empty, and the snake can move UP without collision. If that's the case, UP is the best move to approach the nearest apple at (3, 4).\n\nSo, my answer is UP.\n\nActually wait, I am not 100% certain. Let's resolve this by interpreting the board as a grid:\n\n```\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n0 # # # # # # # #\n1 # . . . A . . #\n2 # . A . . . . #\n3 # . . . A . . #\n4 # S S . . . . #\n5 # S H . . . . #\n6 # . . . . . . #\n7 # # # # # # # #\n```\n\nwhere '.' represents an empty cell, '#' represents a wall, 'A' represents an apple, 'S' represents a snake body segment, and 'H' represents the snake head.\n\nLooking at this, the snake's head is at (5, 2), and the body segments are at (5, 1), (4, 1), and (4, 2).\n\nIf the snake is moving RIGHT, the head will move to (5, 3), which is an empty cell.\n\nIf the snake turns UP, the head will move to (4, 3). Is (4, 3) empty? If I analyze the grid I've just drawn, it is indeed empty. There are body segments at (4, 1) and (4, 2), but not at (4, 3).\n\nSo I believe UP is a valid move, and given the proximity to the apple at (3, 4), it also seems to be the optimal move.\n\nSo yes, my answer is UP.\n\nActually, just to be 100% sure, I'll interpret the original board character by character. Let's look at row 4:\n\n\"#SS    #\"\n\nFrom left to right:\n- '#' at the 0th position (wall).\n- 'S' at the 1st position.\n- 'S' at the 2nd position.\n- Empty space at the 3rd position.\n- Empty space at the 4th position.\n- Empty space at the 5th position.\n- Empty space at the 6th position.\n- '#' at the 7th position (wall).\n\nSo, (4, 3) is indeed an empty space, not a snake body segment.\n\nTherefore, if the snake turns UP from its current position and direction (RIGHT), the head will move to (4, 3), which is a valid move.\n\nAnd as I've deduced earlier, it's a better move in terms of approaching the closest apple at (3, 4).\n\nSo, my answer is UP.\n\nOK, I'm convincid that position (4, 3) in this board:\n\n```\n########\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n#   A  #\n#SS    #\n#SH    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nIs an empty space, not snake head, not snake body, not an apple, not a wall. There's nothing there.\n\nI've also convinced myself that moving UP is a valid move since (4, 3) is empty and the snake is currently moving RIGHT. It's a valid move to turn UP (or DOWN) from RIGHT, but not to turn LEFT, as that would be a 180-degree turn.\n\nI also know that UP is the best move to approach the apple at (3, 4).\n\nSo yes, my final answer is UP.Game board:\n```\n########\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n#   A  #\n#SS    #\n#SH    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nI'll analyze the current game state and determine the best move.\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (5, 2), and its body segments 'S' are at positions (5, 1), (4, 1), and (4, 2). The snake is currently moving RIGHT.\n\nLooking at the possible moves:\n- RIGHT: Would move the head to (5, 3), which is an empty space. This is a valid move.\n- UP: Would move the head to (4, 3), which is also an empty space. This is a valid move.\n- DOWN: Would move the head to (6, 2), which is an empty space. This is a valid move.\n- LEFT: This would be reversing the current direction, which is not allowed according to the rules.\n\nI need to decide which is the best move to reach an apple efficiently.\n\nThere are three apples on the board:\n1. At position (1, 4)\n2. At position (2, 2)\n3. At position (3, 4)\n\nIf I move UP, I can then move RIGHT to reach the apple at (3, 4) in just 3 moves total. This is the quickest path to any apple from the current position.\n\nMoving RIGHT or DOWN would take me further away from all apples, requiring more moves to reach any of them.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to turn UP, which will position the snake to efficiently reach the closest apple.\n\nAnswer: UP"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

I need to control a snake in a Snake game.\n2. The snake is represented by 'H' (head) and 'S' (body).\n3. Apples are represented by 'A'.\n4. I need to eat as many apples as possible to increase the score.\n5. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the walls.\n6. I need to give a direction (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) for the snake to move.\n7. The snake cannot reverse its direction directly.\n\nCurrent state:\n- Game board is 8x8.\n- The snake's head 'H' is at row 5, column 4 (counting from 1).\n- There are three apples: \n  - Two at row 6 (column 2 and column 3)\n  - One at row 7 (column 2)\n- The current direction is UP.\n- The snake's length is currently just the head (no body segments yet).\n- The current epoch is 1.\n\nNow, I need to decide which direction to move the snake. The current direction is UP, which means the snake is moving upward. Based on the rules, I cannot directly reverse the direction, so I cannot choose DOWN.\n\nLet's consider the available options:\n1. UP: The snake will move upward, which means the head will go to row 4, column 4. There's no apple there, but it's a safe move.\n2. LEFT: The snake will move to the left, which means the head will go to row 5, column 3. There's no apple there, but it's closer to the apple at row 6, column 3.\n3. RIGHT: The snake will move to the right, which means the head will go to row 5, column 5. There's no apple there, and it's moving away from the apples.\n\nGiven that the goal is to eat as many apples as possible, and there's an apple at row 6, column 3, it would be beneficial to move LEFT so that in the next move, I can move DOWN to eat the apple.\n\nSo, my decision is to move LEFT.\n\nActually, let me double-check the row and column indices. The game board is:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#AA    #\n#A     #\n########\n```\n\nSo counting from 0 (which is common in programming):\n- Row 0 and Row 7 are walls.\n- Column 0 and Column 7 are walls.\n- The snake's head 'H' is at row 4, column 3.\n- The two apples 'A' are at row 5, columns 1 and 2.\n- The third apple 'A' is at row 6, column 1.\n\nGiven this, let's reconsider the options:\n1. UP: The snake will move upward, which means the head will go to row 3, column 3. There's no apple there, but it's a safe move.\n2. LEFT: The snake will move to the left, which means the head will go to row 4, column 2. There's no apple there, but it's closer to the apples.\n3. RIGHT: The snake will move to the right, which means the head will go to row 4, column 4. There's no apple there, and it's moving away from the apples.\n\nI think the best strategy at this point would be to go LEFT to get closer to the apples, and in the subsequent moves, go DOWN to eat them.\n\nSo, my final decision is to move LEFT.\n\nActually, let me count more carefully to make sure I'm getting the indices right:\n\n```\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n0 ########\n1 #      #\n2 #      #\n3 #      #\n4 #  H   #\n5 #AA    #\n6 #A     #\n7 ########\n```\n\nSo the snake's head 'H' is at row 4, column 3. The apples 'A' are at:\n- (5, 1) - Row 5, column 1\n- (5, 2) - Row 5, column 2\n- (6, 1) - Row 6, column 1\n\nAlright, so the best strategy at this point would be to go LEFT to get closer to the apples, and in the subsequent moves, go DOWN to eat them.\n\nDirection: LEFTGame board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#AA    #\n#A     #\n########\n```\n\nTo determine the best move, I need to analyze the game board.\n\nThe snake's head (H) is currently at position (4,3), and there are three apples:\n- Two apples (AA) at row 5, columns 1 and 2\n- One apple (A) at row 6, column 1\n\nSince the current direction is UP, I can move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (cannot move DOWN as it would be a direct reversal).\n\nMy goal is to eat as many apples as possible. If I move LEFT, I'll get closer to the cluster of apples. Then in subsequent moves, I can go DOWN to start eating the apples.\n\nMoving UP or RIGHT would take me further away from the apples, which isn't optimal.\n\nTherefore, my best move is to go LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Let me analyze the given game state:\n\n1. Game board is 8x8.\n2. Walls (#) surround the edges of the board.\n3. The snake's head (H) is at position (4, 2) from the top-left corner (assuming 0-indexed, where (0, 0) is the top-left corner).\n4. There are three apples (A) on the board: two at positions (5, 1) and (5, 2), and one at (6, 1).\n5. The current direction of the snake is LEFT.\n6. The current epoch is 2.\n\nNow, I need to decide the next move. The snake cannot reverse its direction, so I can't move RIGHT (opposite of LEFT). I can move UP, DOWN, or continue moving LEFT.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n1. LEFT: If I keep moving LEFT, the snake's head will move from (4, 2) to (4, 1). There's no apple there, so the snake won't grow.\n2. UP: If I move UP, the snake's head will move from (4, 2) to (3, 2). There's no apple there, so the snake won't grow.\n3. DOWN: If I move DOWN, the snake's head will move from (4, 2) to (5, 2). There's an apple at (5, 2), so the snake will eat it and grow.\n\nGiven these options, moving DOWN seems to be the best choice because the snake will eat an apple and increase its score.\n\nActually, let me double-check the coordinates. The board is:\n\n```\n########  0\n#      #  1\n#      #  2\n#      #  3\n# H    #  4\n#AA    #  5\n#A     #  6\n########  7\n```\n\nAnd labeling the columns:\n\n```\n01234567\n########  0\n#      #  1\n#      #  2\n#      #  3\n# H    #  4\n#AA    #  5\n#A     #  6\n########  7\n```\n\nSo the snake's head (H) is at position (4, 1) (row 4, column 1). The apples (A) are at positions (5, 1), (5, 2), and (6, 1).\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT, it will move to position (4, 0), which is a wall (#). This will result in a collision and end the game.\nIf the snake moves UP, it will move to position (3, 1). There's no apple there, so the snake won't grow.\nIf the snake moves DOWN, it will move to position (5, 1). There's an apple at (5, 1), so the snake will eat it and grow.\n\nActually, let me re-orient myself one more time. I think I've been mixed up on the coordinates.\n\n```\n01234567\n########  0\n#      #  1\n#      #  2\n#      #  3\n# H    #  4\n#AA    #  5\n#A     #  6\n########  7\n```\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (row=4, column=1). The apples (A) are at positions:\n- (row=5, column=1)\n- (row=5, column=2)\n- (row=6, column=1)\n\nLet's consider each direction:\n- LEFT: Move from (4, 1) to (4, 0). This is a wall, so the game ends.\n- RIGHT: Move from (4, 1) to (4, 2). There's no apple, so the snake won't grow. Also, can't reverse direction from LEFT to RIGHT, so can't move RIGHT now.\n- UP: Move from (4, 1) to (3, 1). There's no apple, so the snake won't grow.\n- DOWN: Move from (4, 1) to (5, 1). There's an apple at (5, 1), so the snake will eat it and grow.\n\nBased on the game state and the rules, the best direction to move is DOWN. This will allow the snake to eat an apple, grow in length, and increase the score by 1.\n\nSo, my answer is DOWN.\n\nActually, let me try one more time to understand the board. \n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# H    #\n#AA    #\n#A     #\n########\n```\n\nThe board is 8x8, with walls (#) around the edges. \nThe snake's head (H) is at the 5th row, 2nd column (using 1-indexed counting).\nThere are three apples (A):\n- One at the 6th row, 2nd column\n- One at the 6th row, 3rd column\n- One at the 7th row, 2nd column\n\nThe current direction is LEFT, which means the snake is moving left.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible moves:\n\n1. Continue moving LEFT: The snake's head will hit the left wall and the game will end.\n2. Move UP: The snake's head will move up, there's no obstacle or apple there.\n3. Move DOWN: The snake's head will move down and eat an apple, increasing the score.\n\nSince moving LEFT will result in a game over and moving UP won't get an apple, the best move is to move DOWN to eat an apple.\n\nSo, my answer is DOWN.\n\nWait, if the snake's head is currently at the position with \"H\" I need to clarify one more time to make sure I'm reading the board correctly.\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# H    #\n#AA    #\n#A     #\n########\n```\n\nUsing 0-indexed positions (row, column):\n- (0, 0) to (7, 0) are all '#' (left wall)\n- (0, 1) to (0, 7) are all '#' (top wall)\n- (1, 7) to (7, 7) are all '#' (right wall)\n- (7, 1) to (7, 6) are all '#' (bottom wall)\n- (4, 1) is 'H' (snake's head)\n- (5, 1) and (5, 2) are 'A' (apples)\n- (6, 1) is 'A' (apple)\n\nThe current direction is LEFT. Moving LEFT means the snake will move from (4, 1) to (4, 0), which is a wall. This will result in a game over.\n\nMoving UP means the snake will move from (4, 1) to (3, 1). There's no apple or obstacle there.\n\nMoving DOWN means the snake will move from (4, 1) to (5, 1). There's an apple there, so the snake will eat it and grow.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best move is DOWN to eat an apple.\n\nSo, my answer is DOWN.Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# H    #\n#AA    #\n#A     #\n########\n```\n\nLet me analyze the current state of the game:\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4, 1) and is currently moving LEFT. There are three apples (A) on the board:\n- One at position (5, 1)\n- One at position (5, 2)\n- One at position (6, 1)\n\nSince the current direction is LEFT, I have three options for my next move:\n1. Continue moving LEFT - This would make the snake hit the wall, ending the game\n2. Move UP - This would move the snake to an empty space\n3. Move DOWN - This would move the snake to an apple, allowing it to eat it and grow\n\nGiven these options, the best move is to go DOWN, which will allow the snake to eat an apple and increase its score.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Let me analyze the game board and the current situation:\n\n```\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S    #\n#AH    #\n#A     #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 3\n\nThe snake has a head (H) and one body segment (S). The snake's head is currently at the 6th row (counting from the top, 1-indexed) and the 2nd column. There's a body segment at the 5th row and 2nd column, which means the snake has just moved DOWN.\n\nThere are three apples (A) on the board:\n1. One at the 6th row and 1st column (immediately to the left of the snake's head)\n2. One at the 7th row and 1st column (diagonally down-left from the snake's head)\n3. One at the 2nd row and 6th column (far away from the snake)\n\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN. According to the rules, I can't reverse the direction directly, so I can't go UP. My options are:\n- Continue moving DOWN\n- Turn LEFT\n- Turn RIGHT\n\nIf I continue moving DOWN, I'll eat the apple at the 7th row and 1st column.\nIf I turn LEFT, I'll eat the apple at the 6th row and 1st column.\nIf I turn RIGHT, I'll just move to an empty space.\n\nSince the goal is to eat as many apples as possible, I should choose either DOWN or LEFT. Since the apple to the LEFT is closer, and I would eat it immediately, I'll choose LEFT. This will change the snake's direction for future moves.\n\nSo my answer is: LEFTGame board:\n\n```\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S    #\n#AH    #\n#A     #\n########\n```\n\nLooking at the game board:\n- The snake's head (H) is at the 6th row, 2nd column.\n- There's one body segment (S) above the head at the 5th row, 2nd column.\n- The current direction is DOWN.\n- There are three apples: one directly to the left of the head, one below and to the left of the head, and one in the upper-right area.\n\nSince I'm currently moving DOWN, I have three possible directions: continue DOWN, turn LEFT, or turn RIGHT (I can't reverse to UP because that's the opposite direction).\n\nIf I move LEFT, I'll immediately eat the apple that's adjacent to my head, which is the most efficient move. This will increase my score by 1 and grow my snake length.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Let me analyze the game board:\n\n```\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S    #\n#HS    #\n#A  A  #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 4\n\nI need to determine the best move for the snake. The snake head is at 'H', which is at position (5,1) if we count from 0 (rows and columns). The body segments are marked with 'S' at positions (5,2) and (4,1).\n\nLet's consider the possible directions:\n- LEFT: The snake is currently moving left, so it can continue moving left. The position to the left of the head is (5,0), which has an apple 'A'. This would allow the snake to eat an apple and grow.\n- UP: The snake can move upward. The position above the head is (4,0), which appears to be empty ('').\n- DOWN: The snake can move downward. The position below the head is (6,0), but this would cause the snake to collide with a wall ('#'), which would end the game.\n- RIGHT: The snake cannot move right because it cannot reverse its direction from LEFT to RIGHT directly.\n\nBased on this analysis, I have two valid options: LEFT and UP. Moving LEFT would allow the snake to eat an apple, which is beneficial. So the best move would be LEFT.\n\nHmm, there seems to be an issue with my coordinate mapping. Let me reanalyze the board:\n\n```\n########\n#    A #  row 0 (after the top wall)\n#      #  row 1\n#      #  row 2\n# S    #  row 3\n#HS    #  row 4\n#A  A  #  row 5\n########\n```\n\nSo the head 'H' is at position (4,1), and there are body segments 'S' at positions (4,2) and (3,1).\n\nLet's reconsider the possible directions:\n- LEFT: The snake is currently moving left, so it can continue moving left. The position to the left of the head is (4,0), which has an apple 'A'. This would allow the snake to eat an apple and grow.\n- UP: The snake can move upward. The position above the head is (3,0), which is empty.\n- DOWN: The snake can move downward. The position below the head is (5,0), which has an apple 'A'. This would allow the snake to eat an apple and grow.\n- RIGHT: The snake cannot move right because it cannot reverse its direction from LEFT to RIGHT directly.\n\nBased on this revised analysis, I have three valid options: LEFT, UP, and DOWN. Moving either LEFT or DOWN would allow the snake to eat an apple, which is beneficial. Since there are two equally good options, I'll choose LEFT to continue in the same direction.\n\nWait, I realized there's a problem with my coordinate mapping. Let me analyze the board more carefully, considering the actual indices of the board:\n\n```\n01234567  (column index)\n0########\n1#    A #\n2#      #\n3#      #\n4# S    #\n5#HS    #\n6#A  A  #\n7########\n```\n\nNow I can see:\n- The head 'H' is at position (1,5) - that is, column 1, row 5\n- There are body segments 'S' at positions (2,5) and (1,4)\n- There's an apple 'A' at positions (0,6), (3,6), and (5,1)\n\nLet's reconsider the possible directions:\n- LEFT: The snake is currently moving left, so it can continue moving left. The position to the left of the head is (0,5), which appears to be empty. However, moving further left would cause the snake to hit a wall.\n- UP: The snake can move upward. The position above the head is (1,4), which has a body segment 'S'. This would cause the snake to collide with itself, which would end the game.\n- DOWN: The snake can move downward. The position below the head is (1,6), which has an apple 'A'. This would allow the snake to eat an apple and grow.\n- RIGHT: The snake cannot move right because it cannot reverse its direction from LEFT to RIGHT directly.\n\nBased on this revised analysis, the only valid and beneficial move is DOWN, which would allow the snake to eat an apple.\n\nWait, I still don't think I'm mapping the board correctly. Let me try a different approach. I'll use row and column notations directly from the board provided:\n\n```\n    01234567  (column index)\n0   ########\n1   #    A #\n2   #      #\n3   #      #\n4   # S    #\n5   #HS    #\n6   #A  A  #\n7   ########\n```\n\nIn this case:\n- The head 'H' is at position (1,5) - that is, row 5, column 1\n- There are body segments 'S' at positions (2,5) and (1,4)\n- There's an apple 'A' at positions (6,1), (1,6), and (4,6)\n\nNow let's examine the possible directions:\n- LEFT: The snake is currently moving left, so it can continue moving left. Moving left from the head (1,5) would take the snake to (0,5), which is a wall. This would result in a game over.\n- UP: The snake can move upward. Moving up from the head (1,5) would take the snake to (1,4), which has a body segment 'S'. This would result in a game over.\n- DOWN: The snake can move downward. Moving down from the head (1,5) would take the snake to (1,6), which has an apple 'A'. This would allow the snake to eat an apple and grow.\n- RIGHT: The snake cannot move right because it cannot reverse its direction from LEFT to RIGHT directly.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only valid and beneficial move is DOWN, which would allow the snake to eat an apple.\n\nActually, I need to be more careful with my coordinate system. Let's use (row, column) notation with 0-based indexing:\n```\n    01234567  (column index)\n 0  ########\n 1  #    A #\n 2  #      #\n 3  #      #\n 4  # S    #\n 5  #HS    #\n 6  #A  A  #\n 7  ########\n```\n\nHead 'H' is at (5, 1)\nBody segments 'S' are at (5, 2) and (4, 1)\nApples 'A' are at (1, 5), (6, 1), and (6, 4)\n\nLet's analyze the possible directions:\n- LEFT: The current direction is LEFT, so the snake can continue in this direction. Moving left from (5, 1) would place the head at (5, 0), which is a wall. This would end the game.\n- UP: Moving up from (5, 1) would place the head at (4, 1), which is a body segment 'S'. This would end the game.\n- DOWN: Moving down from (5, 1) would place the head at (6, 1), which has an apple 'A'. This would allow the snake to eat an apple and grow.\n- RIGHT: The snake cannot move right because it cannot reverse its direction from LEFT to RIGHT directly.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only viable option is to move DOWN, which would allow the snake to eat an apple.\n\nHmm, I'm still finding it confusing to map the coordinates. Let me try again with a different approach.\n\nI'll use directions relative to the head position directly:\n1. The head 'H' is at a specific position on the board.\n2. We need to check what's to the left, right, up, and down from the head.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n```\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S    #\n#HS    #\n#A  A  #\n########\n```\n\nI can see:\n- To the left of 'H' is the left wall of the board.\n- To the right of 'H' is a body segment 'S'.\n- Above 'H' is a body segment 'S'.\n- Below 'H' is an apple 'A'.\n\nThe current direction is LEFT, which means the snake is moving towards the left wall. However, moving left would cause the snake to hit the wall, which would end the game.\n\nSince the snake cannot reverse direction (from LEFT to RIGHT), the only valid directions to consider are LEFT, UP, and DOWN.\n- Moving LEFT would cause the snake to hit the wall, ending the game.\n- Moving UP would cause the snake to hit its own body, ending the game.\n- Moving DOWN would allow the snake to eat an apple.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN.\n\nWait, I think I'm making a mistake in reading the board. Let me analyze it again:\n\n```\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S    #\n#HS    #\n#A  A  #\n########\n```\n\nLooking more carefully:\n- 'H' is not adjacent to the left wall; there's one empty space to the left of 'H'.\n- 'H' is adjacent to the body segment 'S' on its right.\n- Above 'H' is a body segment 'S'.\n- Below 'H' is an apple 'A'.\n\nNow let's reconsider the possible directions:\n- LEFT: The snake is currently moving left, so it can continue in this direction. Moving left from 'H' would place the head in the empty space to the left of 'H'.\n- UP: Moving up from 'H' would cause the snake to hit its own body, ending the game.\n- DOWN: Moving down from 'H' would allow the snake to eat an apple.\n- RIGHT: The snake cannot move right because it cannot reverse its direction from LEFT to RIGHT directly.\n\nBased on this revised analysis, there are two viable options: LEFT and DOWN. Moving DOWN would allow the snake to eat an apple, while moving LEFT would just continue in the current direction. Since eating apples increases the score and grows the snake, moving DOWN is the better option.\n\nLet me try to be really precise:\n\n```\n    01234567  (column index)\n 0  ########\n 1  #    A #\n 2  #      #\n 3  #      #\n 4  # S    #\n 5  #HS    #\n 6  #A  A  #\n 7  ########\n```\n\nLooking at the board: \n- Each row starts with '#' (the wall) at index 0 and ends with '#' at index 7.\n- The head 'H' is at row 5, column 1.\n- To the left of the head (row 5, column 0) is the wall '#'.\n- To the right of the head (row 5, column 2) is a body segment 'S'.\n- Above the head (row 4, column 1) is a body segment 'S'.\n- Below the head (row 6, column 1) is an apple 'A'.\n\nGiven that the current direction is LEFT, and considering the rule that the snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn from LEFT to RIGHT directly), the possible directions are:\n- LEFT: Moving left would cause the snake to hit the wall at (row 5, column 0), ending the game.\n- UP: Moving up would cause the snake to hit its own body at (row 4, column 1), ending the game.\n- DOWN: Moving down would place the head at (row 6, column 1), allowing the snake to eat an apple.\n\nThe only viable option is DOWN.\n\nActually, I think I need to pay closer attention to the exact board layout:\n\n```\n########  (row 0)\n#    A #  (row 1)\n#      #  (row 2)\n#      #  (row 3)\n# S    #  (row 4)\n#HS    #  (row 5)\n#A  A  #  (row 6)\n########  (row 7)\n```\n\nNow, let's locate the head and analyze its surroundings:\n- The head 'H' is at row 5, column 1.\n- Directly to the left of the head (row 5, column 0) is '#', which is a wall.\n- Directly to the right of the head (row 5, column 2) is 'S', which is a body segment.\n- Directly above the head (row 4, column 1) is 'S', which is a body segment.\n- Directly below the head (row 6, column 1) is 'A', which is an apple.\n\nGiven that the current direction is LEFT, the possible directions are:\n- LEFT: This would move the head to (row 5, column 0), which is a wall. This would end the game.\n- UP: This would move the head to (row 4, column 1), which is a body segment. This would end the game.\n- DOWN: This would move the head to (row 6, column 1), which is an apple. This would allow the snake to eat the apple and grow.\n\nSince the snake cannot reverse its direction (from LEFT to RIGHT), and both LEFT and UP would result in a game over, the only valid and beneficial move is DOWN.\n\nSo my final answer is: DOWN.\n\nOk, now I'm more confident that the answer is DOWN. Let's double check:\n\n```\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S    #\n#HS    #\n#A  A  #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\n- Left of the head is a wall, so moving LEFT is not valid.\n- Above the head is part of the snake's body, so moving UP is not valid.\n- Right of the head is also part of the snake's body, and since the snake is currently moving LEFT, it cannot reverse direction and move RIGHT.\n- Below the head is an apple, so moving DOWN is valid and would allow the snake to eat the apple.\n\nTherefore, the best direction to move is DOWN.I need to analyze the game board and find the best direction for the snake to move.\n\nGame board:\n```\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S    #\n#HS    #\n#A  A  #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 4\n\nLet me analyze the possible moves:\n\n1. LEFT: The snake is currently moving left. If it continues left, it will hit the wall at position (5,0), which would end the game.\n\n2. UP: If the snake moves up, it will hit its own body segment at (4,1), which would also end the game.\n\n3. RIGHT: The snake cannot reverse direction from LEFT to RIGHT directly according to the rules.\n\n4. DOWN: If the snake moves down, it will reach position (6,1) which contains an apple 'A'. This will allow the snake to eat the apple, grow in length, and increase the score by 1.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only viable option that won't end the game and will increase the score is moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Let me analyze the game board first:\n\n```\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S    #\n#SS    #\n#H  A  #\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head \"H\" is at the bottom left of the board, and there are three \"S\" body segments above it. The snake's current direction is DOWN.\n\nSince the snake cannot reverse direction, it cannot go UP (which would be the opposite of DOWN). So the valid directions are LEFT, RIGHT, and continuing DOWN.\n\nLet's see what happens in each case:\n\n1. **LEFT**: The snake would move left from its current position. However, the left edge is a wall \"#\", so this would cause the snake to collide with the wall and lose the game.\n\n2. **RIGHT**: The snake would move right and be at the position where there's an apple \"A\". This would allow the snake to eat the apple, grow in length, and increase the score.\n\n3. **DOWN**: The snake would continue moving down, but the bottom edge is a wall \"#\", so this would cause the snake to collide with the wall and lose the game.\n\nSince moving LEFT or DOWN would result in collision with the wall, and moving RIGHT would allow the snake to eat an apple and continue the game, the best direction to choose is RIGHT.\n\nActually, I need to double-check the wall positions. Let me look at the game board again:\n\n```\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S    #\n#SS    #\n#H  A  #\n########\n```\n\nI see that the walls (#) are at the edges of the board. Given the current position of the snake's head (H), if it moves LEFT, it would indeed hit the wall. If it moves DOWN, it would also hit the wall. But if it moves RIGHT, it would move towards the apple (A) on the same row.\n\nSo, my answer is RIGHT.Game board:\n```\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S    #\n#SS    #\n#H  A  #\n########\n```\n\nLooking at the current game board:\n- The snake's head 'H' is at the bottom left corner of the playable area\n- There are 3 body segments 'S' trailing above the head\n- The snake is currently moving DOWN\n- There are 3 apples 'A' on the board: one in the top left, one in the top right, and one to the right of the snake's head\n\nSince the snake is currently moving DOWN, my options are to continue moving DOWN or turn LEFT or RIGHT. \n\nIf I move DOWN, I'll hit the wall and lose the game.\nIf I move LEFT, I'll also hit the wall and lose the game.\nIf I move RIGHT, I'll be able to eat the apple that's on the same row as the snake's head.\n\nThe best move is to turn RIGHT to eat the apple and continue the game.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","HTTPError 529: {\"error\":{\"message\":\"-4316: Overloaded\",\"code\":\"-4307\"}}"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The snake cannot reverse its direction, so I cannot go DOWN (which would be the reverse of UP).\n\nI could go:\n- LEFT (to position (4,2))\n- RIGHT (to position (4,4))\n- UP (to position (3,3))\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nLEFT (to position (4,2)):\n- This would move the snake's head left.\n- There is no apple there, so the snake will just move.\n- There is no risk of collision.\n\nRIGHT (to position (4,4)):\n- This would move the snake's head right.\n- There is no apple there, so the snake will just move.\n- There is no risk of collision.\n\nUP (to position (3,3)):\n- This would continue the snake's current direction.\n- There is no apple there, so the snake will just move.\n- There is no risk of collision.\n\nSince there is an apple at position (2,4), I should try to move towards it. If I go UP now (to (3,3)), I'll be closer to that apple. Then, in the next turn, I could go RIGHT to reach the apple. So, continuing UP seems like a good strategy.\n\nSo, I'll choose to continue moving UP.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The current board is:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#  HA  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nAnd the snake's head is at (4,3). I notice there's an apple at (4,5), which is to the RIGHT of the snake's head. I can get this apple immediately by going RIGHT.\n\nSo, I'll choose to go RIGHT.\n\nActually, wait. Let me check the board format again. In grid notations, (row, column) the top-left is usually (0, 0). But in the description, the game board is printed, so the first row is row 0, the second row is row 1, and so on.\n\nLet's reanalyze:\n- The snake's head (H) is at position (row 4, column 3) (0-indexed)\n- There are apples (A) at (row 2, column 4), (row 4, column 5), and (row 5, column 1) (0-indexed)\n\nSo I can go RIGHT to get the apple at (4, 5), or I can go UP to move closer to the apple at (2, 4).\n\nLet's go RIGHT to get the immediate apple. This will increase the snake's length and the score.\n\nActually, hold on. Let me be more precise.\n\nThe board is a grid with the following coordinates (row, column), where row increases from top to bottom and column increases from left to right:\n\n```\n(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (0,5) (0,6) (0,7)\n(1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7)\n(2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6) (2,7)\n(3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6) (3,7)\n(4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6) (4,7)\n(5,0) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (5,7)\n(6,0) (6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (6,7)\n(7,0) (7,1) (7,2) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7)\n```\n\nThe game board given is:\n\n```\n########  (0,0) to (0,7)\n#      #  (1,0) to (1,7)\n#   A  #  (2,0) to (2,7)\n#      #  (3,0) to (3,7)\n#  HA  #  (4,0) to (4,7)\n#A     #  (5,0) to (5,7)\n#      #  (6,0) to (6,7)\n########  (7,0) to (7,7)\n```\n\nSo:\n- The snake's head (H) is at (4,3)\n- Apple (A) is at (2,4), (4,5), and (5,1)\n\nThe apple at (4,5) is to the RIGHT of the snake. So if I go RIGHT, I'll eat that apple.\n\nSo, I'll choose to go RIGHT.\n\nHmm, actually, let me be even more careful and parse the board character by character:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#  HA  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nConsidering the first row and column as indices 0, and the characters within the border:\n- Row 0, Col 0-7: '#' (border)\n- Row 1, Col 0: '#' (border), Col 1-6: ' ' (empty), Col 7: '#' (border)\n- Row 2, Col 0: '#' (border), Col 1-3: ' ' (empty), Col 4: 'A' (apple), Col 5-6: ' ' (empty), Col 7: '#' (border)\n- Row 3, Col 0: '#' (border), Col 1-6: ' ' (empty), Col 7: '#' (border)\n- Row 4, Col 0: '#' (border), Col 1-2: ' ' (empty), Col 3: 'H' (snake head), Col 4: 'A' (apple), Col 5-6: ' ' (empty), Col 7: '#' (border)\n- Row 5, Col 0: '#' (border), Col 1: 'A' (apple), Col 2-6: ' ' (empty), Col 7: '#' (border)\n- Row 6, Col 0: '#' (border), Col 1-6: ' ' (empty), Col 7: '#' (border)\n- Row 7, Col 0-7: '#' (border)\n\nSo, the positions of the entities are:\n- Snake head (H): (4, 3)\n- Apples (A): (2, 4), (4, 4), (5, 1)\n\nI notice there's actually an apple RIGHT next to the snake's head at (4, 4). So, if I go RIGHT, I'll definitely eat an apple.\n\nThe current direction is UP, which means the snake is moving UP. Since the snake cannot reverse its direction, I cannot go DOWN.\n\nI can go LEFT, RIGHT, or continue going UP.\n\nGoing RIGHT will immediately eat an apple, which is a good move. So, I'll choose to go RIGHT.\n\nActually, I think I'm causing confusion for myself. Let me be even more careful. The state of the snake is as follows:\n\n1. The snake's head (H) is at the position where there is an 'H' character in the board, which is row 4, column 3 (counting from 0).\n\n2. The current direction is UP, which means the snake was moving UP before.\n\n3. I can choose to go LEFT, RIGHT, or continue going UP, but not DOWN (the reverse of the current direction).\n\n4. There's an apple (A) at row 4, column 4, which is immediately to the RIGHT of the snake's head. If I go RIGHT, the snake will eat this apple, its length will increase by 1, and the score will increase by 1.\n\nSo, it seems clear that the best move is to go RIGHT.\n\nLet's double-check:\n- The snake's head (H) is at (4,3).\n- There is an apple (A) at (4,4), which is RIGHT of the snake's head.\n- Going RIGHT will eat the apple, which is beneficial.\n\nTherefore, I'll choose to go RIGHT.\n\nActually, I realized something. I was confusing myself by using a 0-indexed system for the row and column, but I think it's clearer if I just focus on the character positions in the game board.\n\nThe game board is:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#  HA  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nFocusing on row 5 (the row where the snake's head is):\n```\n#  HA  #\n```\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at column 4, and there's an apple (A) at column 5. So, if the snake moves RIGHT, it will eat this apple. This is a good move.\n\nSo, I'll choose to go RIGHT.\n\nActually, let's just be absolutely clear and count the characters in the game board to pinpoint the exact positions.\n\nThe game board is:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#  HA  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nLet's number the rows and columns:\n```\n   01234567\n  0########\n  1#      #\n  2#   A  #\n  3#      #\n  4#  HA  #\n  5#A     #\n  6#      #\n  7########\n```\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at row 4, column 3.\nThere's an apple (A) at row 4, column 4, which is immediately to the RIGHT of the snake's head.\nThere's another apple (A) at row 2, column 4, which is UP and to the RIGHT of the snake's head.\nAnd there's one more apple (A) at row 5, column 1, which is DOWN and to the LEFT of the snake's head.\n\nThe current direction is UP, so the snake is moving UP. I cannot go DOWN (the reverse of UP).\n\nIf I go RIGHT, the snake will eat the apple at (4,4), which is a good move. So, my decision is to go RIGHT.\n\nActually, let's TRIPLE check:\n```\n   01234567\n  0########\n  1#      #\n  2#   A  #\n  3#      #\n  4#  HA  #\n  5#A     #\n  6#      #\n  7########\n```\n\nSnake head (H): (4,3)\nApples (A): (2,4), (4,4), (5,1) <--- I think this is the right layout\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nPotential next moves:\n- LEFT: Move to (4,2). No apple here.\n- RIGHT: Move to (4,4). There's an apple here!\n- UP: Move to (3,3). No apple here.\n\nGoing RIGHT seems like the best move as there's an apple at (4,4).\n\nSo, the direction I give is: RIGHTGame board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#  HA  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nLooking at the current game board, I can see:\n- The snake's head (H) is at row 4, column 3\n- There are apples (A) at positions: \n  * (2,4) - upper part of the board\n  * (4,4) - immediately to the RIGHT of the snake's head\n  * (5,1) - lower left of the board\n- Current direction is UP\n\nSince there's an apple directly to the RIGHT of the snake's head, the best move would be to turn RIGHT and immediately eat that apple. This would increase my score by 1 and grow the snake by one segment.\n\nThe other options would be to continue moving UP or turn LEFT, but neither of those would result in eating an apple immediately.\n\nSince I'm currently moving UP, I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP (I cannot go DOWN as that would be reversing direction).\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Let me analyze the game board and the current state of the snake:\n\n1. Current game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n#  SH  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\n2. Current direction: RIGHT\n3. Current epoch: 2\n4. Snake position: The head (H) is at position (4, 4) (row 5, column 5), and there's one body segment (S) at position (4, 3) (row 5, column 4). So the snake is moving to the right.\n\nNow I need to decide the next direction for the snake. The snake can move UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT. It cannot move LEFT because that would be a reversal of direction (the snake can't reverse).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible direction:\n\n1. RIGHT: The snake would move to position (4, 5). This is an empty space, so it's safe.\n2. UP: The snake would move to position (3, 4). This is an empty space, so it's safe.\n3. DOWN: The snake would move to position (5, 4). There's an apple (A) here, so the snake would eat it and grow.\n\nGiven these options, the best move is probably DOWN because the snake would eat an apple and increase the score.\n\nHowever, I should also consider the long-term strategy. Let's check if there's a better move considering the positions of the other apples:\n\n- There's an apple at position (2, 4) (row 3, column 5).\n- There's an apple at position (3, 1) (row 4, column 2).\n- There's an apple at position (5, 1) (row 6, column 2).\n\nIf the snake moves DOWN to eat the apple at (5, 4), it would then be facing DOWN. From there, it could move LEFT to approach the apple at (5, 1), but it would need to navigate carefully to avoid hitting the wall or itself.\n\nIf the snake moves UP, it could approach the apple at (2, 4).\n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT, it would be moving away from all the apples.\n\nGiven these considerations, I believe moving DOWN is the best option because it immediately increases the score and positions the snake closer to another apple.\n\nSo my answer is: DOWN\n\nLet me double-check:\n- Moving DOWN will not cause the snake to collide with itself or the walls.\n- Moving DOWN will allow the snake to eat an apple, which is good for the score.\n- Moving DOWN is not a reversal of direction, which is not allowed.\n\nYes, the answer is DOWN.Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n#  SH  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nI need to decide the best direction for the snake to move next. The snake is currently moving RIGHT, and I can see there's an apple directly below the snake's head.\n\nLet me analyze my options:\n- RIGHT: Would move into an empty space\n- UP: Would move into an empty space\n- DOWN: Would move onto an apple, earning a point\n- LEFT: Cannot choose this as it would reverse direction\n\nThe best choice is to move DOWN to eat the apple and increase my score. This won't cause any collision with walls or the snake's body, and it positions me closer to another apple at the bottom left of the board.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Let me analyze the game board:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n#   S  #\n#A  H  #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 3\n\nIn this game board:\n- The snake's head (H) is at the 6th row, 5th column.\n- There's a snake body segment (S) at the 5th row, 5th column.\n- There are three apples (A): one at the 3rd row, 5th column, one at the 4th row, 2nd column, and one at the 6th row, 2nd column.\n\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN. Given the rules:\n1. The snake cannot reverse its direction (so it cannot go UP since it's currently moving DOWN).\n2. The snake will lose if it collides with the walls or itself.\n\nLet's check the possible moves:\n\n1. Continue moving DOWN:\n   - The snake's head will move to the 7th row, 5th column.\n   - This is an empty space, so the snake will just move forward.\n   - This move is legal and safe.\n\n2. Move LEFT:\n   - The snake's head will move to the 6th row, 4th column.\n   - This is an empty space, so the snake will just move forward.\n   - This move is legal and safe.\n\n3. Move RIGHT:\n   - The snake's head will move to the 6th row, 6th column.\n   - This is also an empty space, so the snake will just move forward.\n   - This move is legal and safe.\n\nAll three moves are legal and safe in this scenario. I need to decide which direction is strategically better for eating apples.\n\nCurrently, there's an apple near the snake in the 3rd row, 5th column. If the snake moves UP (which is not possible since it's moving DOWN), it would be closer to this apple. Since the snake can't go UP, moving LEFT or RIGHT won't get it closer to this apple.\n\nThere's another apple at the 4th row, 2nd column. Moving LEFT would get the snake closer to this apple.\n\nThere's a third apple at the 6th row, 2nd column. This is on the same row as the snake's head, so moving LEFT would lead it directly toward this apple.\n\nGiven these considerations, moving LEFT seems like the best strategic choice as it directs the snake toward two of the three apples.\n\nActually, I made a mistake. Let me correctly identify the positions on the board. The rows and columns should be 0-indexed.\n\n- The snake's head (H) is at row 5, column 4.\n- There's a snake body segment (S) at row 4, column 4.\n- There are apples at: row 2, column 4; row 3, column 1; and row 5, column 1.\n\nThe snake is moving DOWN, which means the head would move from row 5 to row 6 in the next move.\n\nLet's re-analyze the possible moves:\n\n1. Continue moving DOWN:\n   - The snake's head will move to row 6, column 4.\n   - This is an empty space, so the snake will just move forward.\n   - This move is legal and safe.\n\n2. Move LEFT:\n   - The snake's head will move to row 5, column 3.\n   - This is an empty space, so the snake will just move forward.\n   - This move is legal and safe.\n\n3. Move RIGHT:\n   - The snake's head will move to row 5, column 5.\n   - This is an empty space, so the snake will just move forward.\n   - This move is legal and safe.\n\nStrategically:\n- Continuing DOWN doesn't lead toward any of the apples in the short term.\n- Moving LEFT gets the snake closer to the apple at row 5, column 1, which is on the same row.\n- Moving RIGHT doesn't lead toward any of the apples in the short term.\n\nMoving LEFT would be the best choice to get closer to one of the apples.\n\nI think my analysis is still not correct. Let me be more careful. Given the game board:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n#   S  #\n#A  H  #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nIf I label the rows and columns starting from 0 (excluding the walls), then:\n- The snake's head (H) is at row 5, column 4.\n- There's a snake body segment (S) at row 4, column 4.\n- There are apples at: row 2, column 4; row 3, column 1; and row 5, column 1.\n\nHmm, but that doesn't seem quite right for the third apple. Let me try again with more care. The board is an 8x8 grid, including the walls:\n\n```\n01234567 (columns)\n0########\n1#      #\n2#   A  #\n3#A     #\n4#   S  #\n5#A  H  #\n6#      #\n7########\n```\n\nSo, based on this labeling:\n- The snake's head (H) is at position (5, 4).\n- The snake body segment (S) is at position (4, 4).\n- The apples (A) are at positions (2, 4), (3, 1), and (5, 1).\n\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN, which means its next position would be (6, 4) if it continues in that direction.\n\nLet's reconsider the possible moves:\n\n1. Continue moving DOWN:\n   - The snake's head will move to position (6, 4).\n   - This is an empty space, so the snake will just move forward.\n   - This move is legal and safe.\n\n2. Move LEFT:\n   - The snake's head will move to position (5, 3).\n   - This is an empty space, so the snake will just move forward.\n   - This move is legal and safe.\n\n3. Move RIGHT:\n   - The snake's head will move to position (5, 5).\n   - This is an empty space, so the snake will just move forward.\n   - This move is legal and safe.\n\nStrategically speaking:\n- Continuing DOWN would move further away from the apples.\n- Moving LEFT gets the snake closer to the apple at position (5, 1).\n- Moving RIGHT doesn't lead directly toward any of the apples.\n\nBased on this analysis, moving LEFT would be the most strategic choice as it gets the snake closer to one of the apples.\n\nSo, my answer is LEFT.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I'm reading the board correctly and my analysis is accurate.\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n#   S  #\n#A  H  #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\n- The walls are marked with '#'.\n- Inside these walls, the playable area is a 6x6 grid.\n- The snake's head (H) is in the 5th row, 5th column (1-indexed within the playable area).\n- There's a body segment (S) directly above the head.\n- There are three apples (A): one to the left of the head in the same row, one in the 3rd row, 5th column, and one in the 4th row, 2nd column.\n\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN. Given the rules, the snake can either continue moving DOWN or change its direction to LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nLooking at the positions of the apples, the closest apple is the one to the left of the head. If the snake turns LEFT, it will move directly toward this apple and can consume it in the next move.\n\nTherefore, the best move would be LEFT.\n\nTo formalize the answer: In the current state, the snake should move LEFT to reach the nearest apple.\n\nActually, I'm still not reading the board correctly. Let me label it:\n\n```\n    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n    ---------------\n0 | # # # # # # # #\n1 | # . . . . . . #\n2 | # . . . A . . #\n3 | # A . . . . . #\n4 | # . . . S . . #\n5 | # A . . H . . #\n6 | # . . . . . . #\n7 | # # # # # # # #\n```\n\nNow, let's check the positions:\n- The snake's head (H) is at position (5, 4).\n- The snake body segment (S) is at position (4, 4).\n- The apples (A) are at positions (2, 4), (3, 1), and (5, 1).\n\nThis seems right. Let me verify one more time.\n\nIn the given game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n#   S  #\n#A  H  #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nLooking at it, the snake's head (H) is in the 6th row (counting from the top), and the 5th column (counting from the left). The body segment (S) is directly above it, in the 5th row and 5th column.\n\nThere's an apple (A) in the 3rd row, 5th column, another one in the 4th row, 2nd column, and a third one in the 6th row (same row as the head), 2nd column.\n\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN. If it continues moving DOWN, the head would move to the 7th row, 5th column, which is an empty space. If the snake turns LEFT, it would move to the 6th row, 4th column, which is an empty space and closer to the apple in the 6th row, 2nd column. If the snake turns RIGHT, it would move to the 6th row, 6th column, which is also an empty space but not moving toward any apple.\n\nGiven these options, moving LEFT seems to be the best choice as it gets the snake closer to one of the apples.\n\nTherefore, the answer is LEFT.\n\nI've made another mistake. Let me be more careful. The game board is 8x8, and I'll label the rows and columns from 0 to 7, counting the walls:\n\n```\n    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n    ---------------\n0 | # # # # # # # #\n1 | # . . . . . . #\n2 | # . . . A . . #\n3 | # A . . . . . #\n4 | # . . . S . . #\n5 | # A . . H . . #\n6 | # . . . . . . #\n7 | # # # # # # # #\n```\n\nLooking at the game board:\n- The snake's head (H) is at position (5, 4).\n- The snake body segment (S) is at position (4, 4).\n- The apples (A) are at positions (2, 4), (3, 1), and (5, 1).\n\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN. If it continues moving DOWN, the head would move to position (6, 4), which is an empty space. If the snake turns LEFT, it would move to position (5, 3), which is an empty space and closer to the apple at position (5, 1). If the snake turns RIGHT, it would move to position (5, 5), which is also an empty space but not moving toward any apple.\n\nStrategically, turning LEFT would get the snake closer to one of the apples. Therefore, the answer is LEFT.\n\nBut I realize I made an error. Let me correctly analyze the game board once more:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n#   S  #\n#A  H  #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nLooking at this board:\n- The snake's head (H) is in the second-to-last row, in the middle-ish of the board.\n- There's a snake body segment (S) directly above the head.\n- There are three apples: one in the third row from the top, one in the fourth row at the far left, and one in the second-to-last row at the far left (the same row as the head).\n\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN. There's an apple in the same row as the head, and it's to the left of the head. If the snake turns LEFT, it will eventually reach this apple. The other two apples are also accessible, but the one in the same row as the head is the closest.\n\nGiven these considerations, turning LEFT is the best strategic move to reach the nearest apple.\n\nTherefore, the answer is LEFT.\n\nLet's ensure that I'm reading the board correctly. Here's how it would be interpreted:\n\n- The outer \"#\" symbols represent the walls of the game board.\n- The playable area is inside these walls, which is a 6x6 grid.\n- The \"H\" represents the snake's head.\n- The \"S\" represents a snake body segment.\n- The \"A\" represents apples that the snake can eat.\n\nIn the given board, the snake's head (H) is at position (5, 4) in the 0-indexed, 8x8 grid (including walls). The snake body segment (S) is at position (4, 4).\n\nThe apples (A) are at positions (2, 4), (3, 1), and (5, 1).\n\nWait, I just realized I've been interpreting the positions based on the convention where (row, column) is the same as (y, x). Let's make sure we're using the same convention.\n\nLooking at the game board:\n```\n    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n    ---------------\n0 | # # # # # # # #\n1 | # . . . . . . #\n2 | # . . . A . . #\n3 | # A . . . . . #\n4 | # . . . S . . #\n5 | # A . . H . . #\n6 | # . . . . . . #\n7 | # # # # # # # #\n```\n\n- The snake's head (H) is at position (5, 4).\n- The snake body segment (S) is at position (4, 4).\n- The apples (A) are at positions (2, 4), (3, 1), and (5, 1).\n\nIf the snake is moving DOWN, it means it's moving from (4, 4) to (5, 4) in its most recent move.\n\nLet's reconsider the possible moves:\n\n1. Continue moving DOWN:\n   - The snake's head will move to position (6, 4).\n   - This is an empty space, so the snake will just move forward.\n   - This move is legal and safe.\n\n2. Move LEFT:\n   - The snake's head will move to position (5, 3).\n   - This is an empty space, so the snake will just move forward.\n   - This move is legal and safe.\n\n3. Move RIGHT:\n   - The snake's head will move to position (5, 5).\n   - This is an empty space, so the snake will just move forward.\n   - This move is legal and safe.\n\nThe apple at position (5, 1) is in the same row as the snake's head. Moving LEFT would get the snake closer to this apple. Therefore, the answer is LEFT.\n\nI hope this analysis is correct. Let me reconstruct the board to make absolutely sure:\n\n```\n# # # # # # # #\n# . . . . . . #\n# . . . A . . #\n# A . . . . . #\n# . . . S . . #\n# A . . H . . #\n# . . . . . . #\n# # # # # # # #\n```\n\nYep, that looks right.\n\nLooking at the positions of the apples again:\n- The apple at position (2, 4) is above the snake.\n- The apple at position (3, 1) is above and to the left of the snake.\n- The apple at position (5, 1) is to the left of the snake in the same row.\n\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN. Given the rule that the snake cannot reverse its direction, it cannot move UP to get closer to the apple at position (2, 4). It can either continue moving DOWN, move LEFT, or move RIGHT.\n\nMoving LEFT would get the snake closer to the apple at position (5, 1), which is the closest apple to the snake. Therefore, the answer is LEFT.\n\nI'm confident in this answer. I think there has been a miscommunication on my part. Let me clarify:\n\nIn the given game board:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n#   S  #\n#A  H  #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\n- The snake's head (H) is in the second-to-last row (counting from top to bottom) and the 5th column (counting from left to right).\n- The snake body segment (S) is directly above the head in the 5th column.\n- There are three apples: one in the 3rd row, 5th column; one in the 4th row, 2nd column; and one in the second-to-last row, 2nd column (the same row as the head).\n\nThe closest apple to the snake is the one in the same row as the head, to the left. Since the snake is currently moving DOWN and can't reverse direction (i.e., it can't move UP), the best move would be to turn LEFT to get closer to this apple.\n\nTherefore, the answer is LEFT.Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n#   S  #\n#A  H  #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 3\n\nI'll analyze this board carefully:\n\nThe snake's head (H) is in the second-to-last row and middle area of the board, with one body segment (S) directly above it. The snake is currently moving DOWN.\n\nThere are three apples on the board:\n1. One apple in the third row, middle area\n2. One apple in the fourth row on the left side \n3. One apple in the same row as the snake's head, on the far left\n\nLooking at my options:\n- If I continue moving DOWN, I'll just move toward the bottom wall with no apples in that direction\n- If I move RIGHT, I won't be heading toward any apples\n- If I move LEFT, I'll be moving directly toward the apple that's in the same row as the snake's head\n\nSince there's an apple in the same row as the snake's head and to the left, the best strategic move is to turn LEFT to approach and eventually eat this apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Let me first understand the game state:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#A HS  #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nThe board is 8x8, surrounded by walls represented by '#'. The snake's head is 'H' and it has a body part 'S', making the snake length 2. There are three apples placed on the board, represented by 'A'. The current direction of the snake is LEFT, which means the snake is moving towards the left side of the board.\n\nThe snake head 'H' is at position (5,3) (counting from 0 from the upper left corner), and the snake body 'S' is at position (5,4). The current direction is LEFT, which means the snake is moving horizontally towards the left.\n\nLet's analyze the possible moves:\n1. LEFT: The snake would move one step to the left, and the head would be at (5,2). There's an apple at (5,2), so the snake would eat the apple, grow in length, and the score would increase by 1. This is a valid move and would increase the score.\n2. UP: The snake would move one step up, and the head would be at (4,3). There's no apple or obstacle, so this is a valid move.\n3. DOWN: The snake would move one step down, and the head would be at (6,3). There's no apple or obstacle, so this is a valid move.\n4. RIGHT: The snake can't move right because it's currently moving left, and the rules state that the snake can't reverse its direction.\n\nGiven these options, I would choose to move LEFT to eat the apple and increase the score.\n\nSo, my final answer is LEFT.Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#A HS  #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nLooking at the current board, I can see the snake's head (H) is at position (5,3) and the body segment (S) is at position (5,4). The snake is currently moving LEFT.\n\nIf I analyze my options:\n1. LEFT: The snake would move to the position where there's an apple (A). This would increase the score by 1 and grow the snake.\n2. UP: The snake would move to an empty space above.\n3. DOWN: The snake would move to an empty space below.\n4. RIGHT: Not possible because the snake is currently moving LEFT and cannot reverse direction.\n\nThe best move is to go LEFT to eat the apple, which will increase my score and grow the snake.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Let me analyze the game board and the current state:\n\n1. The game board is 8x8 with walls (#) around the edges.\n2. The snake's head (H) is currently at position (5, 3) (row 5, column 3) if we count from 0, or (6, 4) if we count from 1.\n3. The snake's body (S) is at position (5, 4) (row 5, column 4) if we count from 0, or (6, 5) if we count from 1.\n4. There are 3 apples (A) on the board:\n   - One at position (2, 4) (row 2, column 4) if we count from 0, or (3, 5) if we count from 1.\n   - One at position (3, 1) (row 3, column 1) if we count from 0, or (4, 2) if we count from 1.\n   - One at position (5, 2) (row 5, column 2) if we count from 0, or (6, 3) if we count from 1.\n5. The current direction of the snake is LEFT.\n\nGiven that the snake is moving LEFT, I need to determine the next best move. The snake cannot reverse its direction, so going RIGHT is not an option (since that would be a reverse of LEFT).\n\nMy options are:\n1. Continue moving LEFT\n2. Turn UP\n3. Turn DOWN\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n1. LEFT: The snake's head would move to position (5, 2), which has an apple. This would increase the score by 1, and the snake would grow in length. This seems like a good option.\n\n2. UP: The snake's head would move to position (4, 3). There's no apple here, but it's a safe move.\n\n3. DOWN: The snake's head would move to position (6, 3). There's no apple here, but it's a safe move.\n\nGiven that moving LEFT would allow the snake to eat an apple, this seems like the best option. It would increase the score and the snake's length without risk of collision.\n\nSo, the direction I would choose is LEFT.Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#AHS   #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nLooking at the game board, I can see that:\n- The snake's head (H) is at position (5,3)\n- There's one body segment (S) at position (5,4)\n- There are three apples (A): at positions (2,4), (3,1), and (5,2)\n- The snake is currently moving LEFT\n\nIf I continue moving LEFT, I'll eat the apple directly to the left of the snake's head. This is the optimal move since:\n1. It's a valid direction (not reversing the current direction)\n2. It will immediately increase my score by eating an apple\n3. There's no risk of collision\n\nBy moving LEFT, the snake's head will move to position (5,2) where there's an apple, and the body segment will follow to the head's previous position.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","HTTPError 529: {\"error\":{\"message\":\"-4316: Overloaded\",\"code\":\"-4307\"}}"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The goal of the game is to control the snake, eat as many apples as possible, and grow the snake in length. Each time the snake eats an apple, the score increases by one. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point. The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#   HA #\n#  SS  #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: \n\nCurrent epoch: 7\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n"],"action":"","response":["Let me analyze this Snake game board.\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n# A    #\n#  A   #\n#  H A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (4, 3) (counting from 0, row-column format).\nThere are 3 apples 'A' on the board:\n- (2, 2)\n- (3, 3)\n- (4, 5)\n\nThe current direction is UP.\n\nI need to decide the next move. Since the snake is currently moving UP, I have three valid options:\n1. Continue moving UP\n2. Turn LEFT\n3. Turn RIGHT\n\nI cannot move DOWN because that would be reversing the current direction, which is not allowed.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n1. Moving UP: The snake would move to position (3, 3), where there's an apple. This would increase the score and grow the snake.\n2. Moving LEFT: The snake would move to position (4, 2), where there's nothing.\n3. Moving RIGHT: The snake would move to position (4, 4), where there's nothing, and it would move away from the apple at (3, 3).\n\nSince there's an apple directly above the snake's head, the best move is to continue moving UP to eat the apple. This will increase the score and the snake's length.\n\nSo my answer is UP.Game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n# A    #\n#  A   #\n#  H A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nLooking at the game board, I can see:\n- The snake's head 'H' is at position (4,3)\n- There are three apples 'A' at positions (2,2), (3,3), and (4,5)\n- The current direction is UP\n- I'm in epoch 1\n\nSince the snake is currently moving UP, I have three valid options:\n1. Continue moving UP\n2. Turn LEFT\n3. Turn RIGHT\n\nIf I move UP, the snake will reach the apple at position (3,3), allowing me to eat it and increase my score.\n\nThe best move is to continue moving UP to immediately eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","Let me analyze the situation here:\n\nGame Board:\n```\n########\n#    A #\n# A    #\n#  H   #\n#  S A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent Direction: UP\nCurrent Epoch: 2\n\nThe snake's head is represented by 'H', which is at position (3, 2) (if we're counting from 0, with the top-left corner being (0, 0)).\nThere's one segment of the snake's body, represented by 'S', which is at position (4, 2).\nThere are three apples ('A') on the board, located at positions (1, 5), (2, 1), and (4, 6).\n\nI need to decide the next direction to move the snake. The snake can't reverse its direction directly, so since it's currently moving UP, I can't choose DOWN.\n\nMy options are:\n- Continue moving UP\n- Turn LEFT\n- Turn RIGHT\n\nIf I continue moving UP, the snake's head will move to position (2, 2), which doesn't have an apple. The snake won't grow.\nIf I turn LEFT, the snake's head will move to position (3, 1), which doesn't have an apple. The snake won't grow.\nIf I turn RIGHT, the snake's head will move to position (3, 3), which doesn't have an apple. The snake won't grow.\n\nLet's think about a strategy. Since the goal is to eat as many apples as possible, I should move in a direction that brings me closer to an apple. The closest apple is at position (2, 1), which is diagonally up and to the left of the snake's head. I can't move diagonally, so I need to decide whether to move UP first or LEFT first to get to this apple.\n\nIf I move UP now, I'll be at position (2, 2), and then I can move LEFT in the next turn to get to the apple.\nIf I move LEFT now, I'll be at position (3, 1), and then I can move UP in the next turn to get to the apple.\n\nBoth paths will take 2 moves to reach the apple, so either option is fine. But there's another apple at position (1, 5), which is up and to the right. If I move UP now, I'll be slightly closer to that apple as well (though it's still far away). So, I'll choose to move UP.\n\nThough, actually, let me visualize what the board would look like after I move UP:\n\n```\n########\n#    A #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#  HS A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nWait, that's not right. The snake is moving on position, the next board would be:\n```\n########\n#    A #\n# AH   #\n#  S   #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nNo, that's still not right. Let me try again.\n\nIf the snake's head is at position (3, 2) and the body is at position (4, 2), and the snake is moving UP, then the snake's head will move to position (2, 2) and the body will move to position (3, 2).\n\nSo the next board would look like:\n```\n########\n#    A #\n# AH   #\n#  S   #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nAnd the snake would end up with its head at (2, 2) and body at (3, 2). No, wait, I see the issue here. When the snake moves UP, the head should go from (3, 2) to (2, 2). The snake doesn't turn into \"S\", rather, the body segments follow.\n\nLet's get this right:\n\nCurrent Board:\n```\n########\n#    A #\n# A    #\n#  H   #\n#  S A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nIf I move UP, the head will go from (3, 2) to (2, 2) (one row up). The body segment at (4, 2) will move up to (3, 2) (where the head was). The new board would look like:\n```\n########\n#    A #\n# AH   #\n#  S   #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nNow, looking at the board above, the head is at (2, 2). I see that if I move LEFT from here, I'll eat the apple at (2, 1). That sounds like a good plan, but that will be my NEXT move, not my CURRENT move.\n\nFor the current move, I've decided to go UP, as it will put me in a position to eat an apple in the next move. So the answer is UP.\n\nHmm, on second thought, I realized there's a better strategy. Since the closest apple is at position (2, 1), I should move LEFT first, which will put me at position (3, 1), and then UP in the next turn to get to the apple. This is more efficient than moving UP first.\n\nHmm no wait, the snake head is at (3, 2) if (0, 0) is the top left. The apple is at (2, 1). If I move LEFT, I'll be at (3, 1), which is one up and one left away from the apple. If I move UP, I'll be at (2, 2), which is one left away from the apple. So moving UP first is better.\n\nActually, I need to clarify these coordinates. Let's use (row, column) coordinates where the top-left wall is at (0, 0):\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at (3, 3).\nThe snake's body 'S' is at (4, 3).\nThe apples 'A' are at (1, 6), (2, 2), and (4, 7).\n\nThe current direction is UP, so the snake is moving to a lower row number.\n\nIf I move UP, the head will go to (2, 3), and I won't eat an apple.\nIf I move LEFT, the head will go to (3, 2), and I won't eat an apple. But this will put me closer to the apple at (2, 2).\nIf I move RIGHT, the head will go to (3, 4), and I won't eat an apple. But this will put me closer to the apple at (1, 6), though not by much.\n\nSince my goal is to eat apples, and moving LEFT puts me directly next to an apple which I can eat on the next move, that seems like the best strategy.\n\nSo, I'll move LEFT.\n\nHmm nope, let me be precise.\n\nIf I'm using 0-based indexing, the game board looks like this:\n```\n0 ########\n1 #    A #\n2 # A    #\n3 #  H   #\n4 #  S A #\n5 #      #\n6 #      #\n7 ########\n  01234567\n```\n\nThe walls are at the perimeter, from (0, 0) to (7, 7).\n\nThe head 'H' is at (3, 3), not (3, 2) as I had previously thought. And the body 'S' is at (4, 3). And the apples 'A' are at positions (1, 5), (2, 1), and (4, 6).\n\nThe current direction is UP, which means the next position of the head if I continue moving UP would be (2, 3). This doesn't have an apple. If I choose LEFT as the next move, the head would move to (3, 2). This also doesn't have an apple. If I choose RIGHT, the head would move to (3, 4). This doesn't have an apple either.\n\nSo I still don't eat an apple immediately regardless of which direction I choose. But which direction brings me closer to an apple?\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distance from the new head position to each apple for each possible move:\n\nFor UP (head at (2, 3)):\n- Distance to apple at (1, 5): |2-1| + |3-5| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- Distance to apple at (2, 1): |2-2| + |3-1| = 0 + 2 = 2\n- Distance to apple at (4, 6): |2-4| + |3-6| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nFor LEFT (head at (3, 2)):\n- Distance to apple at (1, 5): |3-1| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5\n- Distance to apple at (2, 1): |3-2| + |2-1| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- Distance to apple at (4, 6): |3-4| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nFor RIGHT (head at (3, 4)):\n- Distance to apple at (1, 5): |3-1| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3\n- Distance to apple at (2, 1): |3-2| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4\n- Distance to apple at (4, 6): |3-4| + |4-6| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nSo, the minimum distances for each move are:\n- UP: 2 (to the apple at (2, 1))\n- LEFT: 2 (to the apple at (2, 1))\n- RIGHT: 3 (to the apples at (1, 5) and (4, 6))\n\nBoth UP and LEFT get us a minimum distance of 2 to an apple, but UP is slightly better because it gets us closer to more apples overall (the sum of distances to all apples is smaller). Actually, LEFT seems to still be slightly better because we get closer to the apple at (2, 1) and the apple at (4, 6). And for the snake game, eating sooner is generally better, so I should prioritize getting to the closest apple.\n\nWait, I realized I made an error in my distance calculations. Let me calculate the Manhattan distance more carefully for each direction:\n\nFor UP (head at (2, 3)):\n- Distance to apple at (1, 5): |2-1| + |3-5| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- Distance to apple at (2, 1): |2-2| + |3-1| = 0 + 2 = 2\n- Distance to apple at (4, 6): |2-4| + |3-6| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nFor LEFT (head at (3, 2)):\n- Distance to apple at (1, 5): |3-1| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5\n- Distance to apple at (2, 1): |3-2| + |2-1| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- Distance to apple at (4, 6): |3-4| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nFor RIGHT (head at (3, 4)):\n- Distance to apple at (1, 5): |3-1| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3\n- Distance to apple at (2, 1): |3-2| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4\n- Distance to apple at (4, 6): |3-4| + |4-6| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nOK, double-check time:\nFor UP:\n- To (1, 5): Moving from (3, 3) to (2, 3), so the distance from (2, 3) to (1, 5) is |2-1| + |3-5| = 1 + 2 = 3. This is correct.\n- To (2, 1): Moving from (3, 3) to (2, 3), so the distance from (2, 3) to (2, 1) is |2-2| + |3-1| = 0 + 2 = 2. This is correct.\n- To (4, 6): Moving from (3, 3) to (2, 3), so the distance from (2, 3) to (4, 6) is |2-4| + |3-6| = 2 + 3 = 5. This is correct.\n\nFor LEFT:\n- To (1, 5): Moving from (3, 3) to (3, 2), so the distance from (3, 2) to (1, 5) is |3-1| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5. This is correct.\n- To (2, 1): Moving from (3, 3) to (3, 2), so the distance from (3, 2) to (2, 1) is |3-2| + |2-1| = 1 + 1 = 2. This is correct.\n- To (4, 6): Moving from (3, 3) to (3, 2), so the distance from (3, 2) to (4, 6) is |3-4| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5. This is correct.\n\nFor RIGHT:\n- To (1, 5): Moving from (3, 3) to (3, 4), so the distance from (3, 4) to (1, 5) is |3-1| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3. This is correct.\n- To (2, 1): Moving from (3, 3) to (3, 4), so the distance from (3, 4) to (2, 1) is |3-2| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4. This is correct.\n- To (4, 6): Moving from (3, 3) to (3, 4), so the distance from (3, 4) to (4, 6) is |3-4| + |4-6| = 1 + 2 = 3. This is correct.\n\nOK, I got the distance calculations right.\n\nSo, the minimum distances for each move are:\n- UP: 2 (to the apple at (2, 1))\n- LEFT: 2 (to the apple at (2, 1))\n- RIGHT: 3 (to the apples at (1, 5) and (4, 6))\n\nHmm, both UP and LEFT lead to a minimum distance of 2 to the apple at (2, 1). Let's think about the next step after each move:\n\nIf I move UP to (2, 3) and the apple is at (2, 1), then I'd need to move LEFT twice more to get to the apple. So that's a total of 3 moves.\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 2) and the apple is at (2, 1), then I'd need to move UP and LEFT once more each to get to the apple. That's a total of 3 moves as well.\n\nSince both paths will take the same number of moves to reach the apple, I can choose either. However, I'll go with LEFT for a more direct path.\n\n(I believe I've been inconsistent in my reasoning so far. With this clarification, I now resolve to choose LEFT as the next move.)\n\nActually, I'm not correct about that. It takes 2 more moves after moving UP to reach the apple at (2, 1), for a total of 3 moves.\nIt takes 2 more moves after moving LEFT to reach the apple at (2, 1), also for a total of 3 moves.\n\nBut I just realized something important: if I move UP to (2, 3), the minimum distance to the apple at (2, 1) becomes 2. If I move LEFT to (3, 2), the minimum distance is also 2. If I move LEFT, then UP, I'll be at (2, 2), which is 1 away from the apple at (2, 1). If I move UP, then LEFT, I'll be at (2, 2), which is also 1 away from the apple at (2, 1). \n\nSo it seems like both UP and LEFT are equally good for getting to the apple at (2, 1).\n\nThere's possibly one more consideration - once I eat the apple at (2, 1), I'll want to eat the other apples as well. So I might want to consider which path sets me up better for the other apples after eating the first one.\n\nIf I go UP and then LEFT, I'll be at (2, 2) after two moves, facing LEFT. If I then eat the apple at (2, 1), I'll be facing LEFT at (2, 1). To then reach the apple at (1, 5), I'd need to turn UP, then RIGHT repeatedly. That's not very direct.\n\nIf I go LEFT and then UP, I'll be at (2, 2) after two moves, facing UP. If I then eat the apple at (2, 1), I'll be facing UP at (2, 1). To reach the apple at (1, 5), I'd need to move LEFT again, and then probably need to swing around somehow. That's also not very direct.\n\nI'd go for UP as it's a more direct path toward the closest apple. So, my answer is UP.\n\nActually, now that I re-look at the directions, the problem states that the current direction is UP, so the snake is already moving upwards. By choosing UP, I'm not changing the direction, and the snake continues to move upwards. If I choose LEFT, the snake turns left and moves in that direction. Let me reconsider.\n\nIf I continue to move UP, the head will go from (3, 3) to (2, 3). This doesn't have an apple, but it's one step closer to the apple at (1, 5).\nIf I choose LEFT as the next move, the head would move from (3, 3) to (3, 2). This doesn't have an apple, but it's one step closer to the apple at (2, 1). Actually, I would end up directly below the apple at (2, 1), and I could immediately eat it on the next turn (by choosing UP).\nIf I choose RIGHT, the head would move from (3, 3) to (3, 4). This doesn't have an apple, but it might be setting up for a path to one of the other apples.\n\nGiven these options, I think LEFT is the best choice, as it puts me in a position to eat an apple on the next turn, which would be more immediate than either of the other two directions.\n\nSo, my answer is LEFT. This way, I'll be moving LEFT in the next step, and then I can move UP to eat the apple at (2, 1) in the subsequent step.\n\nActually, to just double-check my logic:\n- The game board is an 8x8 grid.\n- The snake's head 'H' is at (3, 3) (if we're counting from 0, with the top-left corner being (0, 0)).\n- There's one segment of the snake's body, represented by 'S', which is at (4, 3).\n- There are three apples ('A') on the board, located at positions (1, 5), (2, 1), and (4, 6).\n- the current snake's head is at position (3, 3). The body is at (4, 3).\n- The current direction is UP.\n- If I keep going UP, the head moves to (2, 3) and the body moves to (3, 3).\n- If I choose LEFT, the head moves to (3, 2) and the body moves to (3, 3).\n- if I choose RIGHT, the head moves to (3, 4) and the body moves to (3, 3).\n- As I mentioned, the closest apple is at (2, 1). Going UP would mean (2, 3), which is 2 steps away from the apple. Going LEFT would mean (3, 2), which is also 2 steps away from the apple. Going RIGHT means (3, 4), which is 4 steps away from the apple. So, based on closeness to the apple at (2, 1), both UP and LEFT are equally good.\n- However, if I go LEFT, then I can go UP in the next step and be at (2, 2), which is right next to the apple at (2, 1). Similarly, if I go UP, then I can go LEFT in the next step (and then LEFT again) to reach the apple. So both paths are equally efficient for reaching the apple at (2, 1).\n- But, looking beyond just the first apple, I might consider which path sets me up better for the other apples as well. Let me double check again with a specific walk through of what happens in the next few steps.\n\nScenario 1: I choose UP.\n- Step 1: HEAD at (2, 3) and part of the BODY at (3, 3). Direction is UP.\n- Step 2: I choose LEFT. HEAD moves to (2, 2), and BODY to (2, 3). Direction is LEFT.\n- Step 3: I choose LEFT again. HEAD moves to (2, 1), BODY to (2, 2) and the TAIL to (2, 3). I eat the APPLE at (2, 1), and the body grows. Direction is LEFT.\n- Step 4: I've eaten the apple and the length of the snake is now 3 (Head, Body, Tail) and I'll have to turn to get to the next APPLE.\n\nScenario 2: I choose LEFT.\n- Step 1: HEAD at (3, 2) and part of the BODY at (3, 3). Direction is LEFT.\n- Step 2: I choose UP. HEAD moves to (2, 2), and BODY to (3, 2). Direction is UP.\n- Step 3: I choose LEFT. HEAD moves to (2, 1), BODY to (2, 2) and TAIL to (3, 2). I eat the APPLE at (2, 1), and the body grows. Direction is LEFT.\n- Step 4: I've eaten the apple and the length of the snake is now 3 (Head, Body, Tail) and I'll have to turn to get to the next APPLE.\n\nSo both scenarios lead to the same result in terms of eating the apple at (2, 1) on the third step. But I want to think about what happens next. Let's assess the positions of the other APPLEs.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (2, 1):\n- Scenario 1: HEAD at (2, 1), BODY at (2, 2), TAIL at (2, 3). Direction is LEFT.\n- Scenario 2: HEAD at (2, 1), BODY at (2, 2), TAIL at (3, 2). Direction is LEFT.\n\nThe other two apples are at (1, 5) and (4, 6), which are both several steps away. From (2, 1) with the snake facing LEFT in both scenarios, the closest (and most sensible) apple to target next is at (1, 5), which is up and to the right. \n\nTo get from (2, 1) to (1, 5) in the fewest steps, I'd want to move UP and then RIGHT multiple times. Since I'm already facing LEFT, I can't immediately turn RIGHT (can't reverse direction). I'd have to turn UP first, then RIGHT. \n\nIn summary:\nScenario 1 (After choosing UP initially):\nHEAD at (2, 1), BODY at (2, 2), TAIL at (2, 3). Direction is LEFT. To get to the next apple, I need to turn UP, then RIGHT, which is a 2-step direction change.\n\nScenario 2 (After choosing LEFT initially):\nHEAD at (2, 1), BODY at (2, 2), TAIL at (3, 2). Direction is LEFT. Also need to turn UP, then RIGHT, which is also a 2-step direction change.\n\nThe difference is in the position of the TAIL. In Scenario 1, the TAIL is at (2, 3), which is 3 steps away from the next apple. In Scenario 2, the TAIL is at (3, 2), which is 4 steps away. But the TAIL position doesn't impact my decision on which direction to move and most of the time doesn't limit the future movement.\n\nBased on this more exhaustive analysis, both UP and LEFT seem equally good for reaching the apple at (2, 1) (at the same step) and setting up for the next apple, with a slight preference for UP because it places the snake's body in a more spread-out configuration.\n\nHowever, I've spent a long time analyzing and haven't converged on a clear superior choice. Given this, I'll use a simpler critereron:  given that the apple at (2, 1) is most efficiently reached by either UP or LEFT, I'll just go with LEFT because that's the direction I'll eventually need to go from (2, 3) to eat the apple.\n\nSo, I move LEFT.\n\nNo, wait. I'm not being consistent because the problem statement is:\n```\nDirection you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n```\n\nSo clearly I'm allowed to continue the direction UP with the UP command.\n\nGiven the two move sequences:\n- Scenario 1: UP, LEFT, LEFT\n- Scenario 2: LEFT, UP, LEFT\n\nBoth lead to eating the apple at (2, 1) on the third step, and neither has a clear advantage for setting up for the next apple.\nI think my most reasonable response is LEFT.\n\nActually, I feel like I've been a bit indecisive. Let me pick the best direction for the following reasons:\n\n1. Both UP and LEFT lead to a position where the apple at (2, 1) is at a distance of 2 from the head.\n2. Both directions will likely result in eating the apple in the same number of steps.\n3. After eating the apple, for both choices, the eventual path to the next apple will involve similar steps.\n4. I'm a bit concerned about the risk of collision with my own body or just as a way to play it safe, I'll choose LEFT.\n\nLEFT is my final answer.\n\nActually hmm, I'm not sure. Let me make sure of exactly where the apple at (2, 1) is and where the head is. From the game board and the grid I provided, the game board is as follows:\n\n```\n0 ########\n1 #    A #\n2 # A    #\n3 #  H   #\n4 #  S A #\n5 #      #\n6 #      #\n7 ########\n  01234567\n```\n\nSo the apple is at (2, 1), the head is at (3, 3), and if I move UP the head is at (2, 3). I would still need to move left twice to eat the apple. If I move LEFT the head is at (3, 2). I'd need to move UP then LEFT to eat the apple. So they're equally viable.\n\nActually, I realized we're still using 0-based indexing. If we count from 0 instead then the board is:\n```\n0 ########\n1 #    A #\n2 # A    #\n3 #  H   #\n4 #  S A #\n5 #      #\n6 #      #\n7 ########\n  01234567\n```\n\nSo the apple is at row 2, column 1. The head is at row 3, column 2. Moving left means the head would be at row 3, column 1, still 1 away from the apple. Moving up means the head would be at row 2, column 2, still 1 away from the apple. And moving right means the head would be at row 3, column 3, now 3 away from the apple. \n\nSo up and left are still equally viable.\n\nI realized I'm supposed to give the answer in the format requested in the prompt.\n\nAnswer: LEFTGame board:\n```\n########\n#    A #\n# A    #\n#  H   #\n#  S A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nI need to decide the best direction to move the snake. Currently, the snake's head (H) is at position (3,2) with the body segment (S) at (4,2). The current direction is UP.\n\nLet me analyze my options:\n- If I continue moving UP, the head will move to (2,2)\n- If I turn LEFT, the head will move to (3,1)\n- If I turn RIGHT, the head will move to (3,3)\n- I cannot move DOWN as that would reverse direction\n\nI see there's an apple at (2,1). If I move LEFT now, I'll be at (3,1), and then I can move UP in the next turn to reach the apple. Similarly, if I move UP now, I'll be at (2,2), and then I can move LEFT to reach the apple.\n\nBoth paths will take the same number of moves to reach the closest apple, but moving LEFT puts me directly below the apple, allowing me to move UP and eat it in the next turn. This seems like the most efficient choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Let me analyze the game board first:\n\n```\n########\n#    A #\n# A    #\n# HS   #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is in the third row, and there's a body segment 'S' to its right. The current direction is LEFT, which means the snake is moving to the left. \n\nThe snake cannot reverse its direction, so the snake cannot go RIGHT (since it's currently moving LEFT). The valid moves would be LEFT, UP, or DOWN.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n1. LEFT: The snake would move one square to the left, to position (3, 1) (third row, second column from the left). There is a wall '#' at this position, so this would cause the snake to collide with the wall and lose the game. So, moving LEFT is not a good option.\n\nWait, I need to re-examine the board. The # characters are the boundaries of the board, not obstacles within the board. Let's look at the coordinates more carefully:\n\n```\n01234567\n0########\n1#    A #\n2# A    #\n3# HS   #\n4#    A #\n5#      #\n6#      #\n7########\n```\n\nSo the snake's head 'H' is at position (3, 2), and its body segment 'S' is at position (3, 3).\n\nIf the snake moves LEFT, it would move to position (3, 1), which is a valid empty space. \nIf the snake moves UP, it would move to position (2, 2), where there's an apple 'A', so it would eat the apple and grow.\nIf the snake moves DOWN, it would move to position (4, 2), which is a valid empty space.\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT, so it can continue in that direction or change to UP or DOWN.\n\nGiven the current state, moving UP seems like a good choice because the snake can eat an apple right away, which increases the score and makes the snake grow longer.\n\nSo, my answer would be 'UP'.\n\nJust to double-check, let's look at the game board one more time:\n\n```\n########\n#    A #\n# A    #\n# HS   #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nIndeed, the snake's head is at (3, 2) and there's an apple at (2, 2), so by moving UP, the snake can eat the apple.\n\nAccording to the rules, I need to:\n1. Give my answer according to the game board and rules.\n2. Output the answer in the required format.\n\nSo my answer is 'UP'.I'll analyze the current game board:\n\n```\n########\n#    A #\n# A    #\n# HS   #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 3\n\nLooking at the board, I can see:\n- The snake's head (H) is at row 3, column 2\n- There's one body segment (S) at row 3, column 3\n- There are three apples (A) on the board\n- The snake is currently moving LEFT\n\nSince the snake cannot reverse direction (can't go RIGHT since it's moving LEFT), my options are:\n1. Continue LEFT - this would move the snake toward the wall\n2. Move UP - this would allow the snake to eat an apple immediately\n3. Move DOWN - this would move to an empty space\n\nThe optimal move is clearly UP, as it will allow the snake to eat an apple right away, increasing its score and length.\n\nAnswer: UP","Let me analyze the game state:\n\nThe snake consists of a head 'H' and two body segments 'S'. The head is at position (2, 2) (where the top-left corner is (0, 0)).\nThe body segments are at (2, 3) and (2, 4).\nThere are 3 apples: at (6, 1), (5, 4), and (6, 5).\nThe current direction is UP.\nWe're at epoch 4.\n\nThe goal is to eat as many apples as possible without hitting the walls or the snake's body.\n\nThe snake can move LEFT, RIGHT, or UP (since it's currently moving UP, it can't move DOWN, which would be reversing its direction).\n\nLet's analyze each possible move:\n\n1. LEFT:\n   - The snake would move to (1, 2).\n   - This is a valid move.\n   - There's no apple at (1, 2), so the snake wouldn't grow.\n   - This would leave us moving towards the left side of the board.\n\n2. RIGHT:\n   - The snake would move to (3, 2).\n   - This is a valid move.\n   - There's no apple at (3, 2), so the snake wouldn't grow.\n   - This would leave us moving towards the right side of the board, where two apples are located.\n\n3. UP:\n   - The snake would move to (2, 1).\n   - This is a valid move.\n   - There's no apple at (2, 1), so the snake wouldn't grow.\n   - This would leave us moving towards the top of the board.\n\nFor all these moves, we're not eating an apple and not increasing score in one step.\n\nWhen I analyze the longer-term strategy, it seems reasonable to head towards the apples. There's an apple at (6, 1), which is in the upper-right part of the board. Another apple is at (5, 4), which is in the right side of the board. And there's one at (6, 5), which is in the lower-right part of the board.\n\nGiven this, it seems best to move RIGHT, which would allow us to head towards the right side of the board, where most of the apples are located. After moving RIGHT, we could continue moving RIGHT and then UP to reach the apple at (6, 1).\n\nSo, the best direction is RIGHT.\n\nWait, let's double-check this. I initially misread the board. Let me correct:\n\n```\n########\n#    A #\n# H    #\n# SS   #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nThe head of the snake is at position (2, 1) (where (0, 0) is the top-left inside the walls, not counting the walls).\nThe body segments are at (2, 2) and (2, 3).\nThe apples are at (5, 0), (5, 3), and (6, 4).\n\nActually, let me count the board positions more carefully, including the walls.\n\nThe wall boundary is the outermost ring, so the top-left inside the board is (1, 1).\n\nSo, the head of the snake is at position (2, 2) (using 1-based indexing including the walls).\nThe body segments are at (2, 3) and (2, 4).\nThe apples are at (6, 1), (5, 4), and (6, 5).\n\nI'm a bit confused here. Let me make sure I'm clear on the conventions.\n\nLooking at the board row by row:\nRow 1: ########\nRow 2: #    A #\nRow 3: # H    #\nRow 4: # SS   #\nRow 5: #    A #\nRow 6: #     A#\nRow 7: #      #\nRow 8: ########\n\nHere's how I'm interpreting the positions:\nThe head 'H' is at row 3, column 3 (where row 1, column 1 is the top-left corner of the entire board). We can call this position (3, 3).\nThe first 'S' is at row 4, column 3. We can call this position (4, 3).\nThe second 'S' is at row 5, column 3. We can call this position (5, 3).\n\nActually, there might be a misunderstanding in how I'm reading the board. Let me stick to the most direct interpretation:\n\nRow 0: ########\nRow 1: #    A #\nRow 2: # H    #\nRow 3: # SS   #\nRow 4: #    A #\nRow 5: #     A#\nRow 6: #      #\nRow 7: ########\n\nWith this, the head 'H' is at (2, 2), the first 'S' is at (3, 2), and the second 'S' is at (3, 3).\n\nBut this doesn't make sense because the snake body wouldn't be in this configuration. I think I've been reading the board incorrectly.\n\nLet me try one more interpretation:\n\n```\n########\n#    A #\n# H    #\n# SS   #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nIf we consider the top-left corner of the board (not counting the walls) as position (0, 0) and read the board as it is, then:\nThe head 'H' is at (1, 2). that's row 2, column 1.\nThe first 'S' is at (1, 3). that's row 3, column 1.\nThe second 'S' is at (2, 3). that's row 3, column 2.\n\nBut this also doesn't look like a snake.\n\nLet's try one more interpretation:\n\n```\n########\n#    A #\n# H    #\n# SS   #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nIf we ignore the walls and use 0-based indexing where (0, 0) is the top-left inside the wall:\nThe first row inside the wall is \"    A \".\nThe second row inside the wall is \" H    \".\nThe third row inside the wall is \" SS   \".\nAnd so on.\n\nWith this:\nThe head 'H' is at (1, 1). That's row 1, column 1.\nOne 'S' is at (0, 2). That's row 2, column 0.\nAnother 'S' is at (1, 2). That's row 2, column 1.\n\nThis also doesn't seem right.\n\nLet me rethink. The board is:\n\n```\n########\n#    A #\n# H    #\n# SS   #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nLet's go with 0-based indexing and consider the top-left corner inside the walls as (0, 0). Then:\nThe head 'H' is at (1, 1). That's row 1, column 1.\nOne 'S' is at (1, 2). That's row 2, column 1.\nAnother 'S' is at (1, 3). That's row 3, column 1.\n\nThis looks like a snake!\n\nSo, the snake's head is at (1, 1) and the body occupies (1, 2) and (1, 3). The current direction is UP.\n\nNow, let's analyze each possible move:\n\n1. LEFT:\n   - The snake would move to (0, 1).\n   - This is a valid move.\n   - There's no apple at (0, 1), so the snake wouldn't grow.\n\n2. RIGHT:\n   - The snake would move to (2, 1).\n   - This is a valid move.\n   - There's no apple at (2, 1), so the snake wouldn't grow.\n\n3. UP:\n   - The snake would move to (1, 0).\n   - This is a valid move.\n   - There's no apple at (1, 0), so the snake wouldn't grow.\n\nFor all these moves, the snake doesn't eat an apple in the immediate next move. But for long-term strategy, we should consider which direction gets us closest to the apples.\n\nThe apples are at:\n- (5, 0). That's row 0, column 5.\n- (4, 3). That's row 3, column 4.\n- (5, 4). That's row 4, column 5.\n\nTo get to the first apple, we need to move right and then up. To get to the second, we need to move right. To get to the third, we need to move right and then down.\n\nGiven this, moving RIGHT seems to be the best choice for now, as it puts us on a path towards all three apples.\n\nOk I realized the issue. When I was trying to map the board to positions, I've been switching the rows and columns in my descriptions. Let me clarify:\n\n```\n########\n#    A #\n# H    #\n# SS   #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nIf we use (row, column) notation (0-indexed, inside the walls):\nThe head 'H' is at (1, 1).\nOne 'S' is at (2, 1).\nAnother 'S' is at (3, 1).\n\nThe apples are at:\n- (0, 5).\n- (3, 5).\n- (4, 6).\n\nAnd the current direction is UP, meaning the snake is moving upwards.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible moves:\n\n1. LEFT:\n   - The snake would move to (1, 0).\n   - This is a valid move.\n   - There's no apple at (1, 0), so the snake wouldn't grow.\n\n2. RIGHT:\n   - The snake would move to (1, 2).\n   - This is a valid move.\n   - There's no apple at (1, 2), so the snake wouldn't grow.\n\n3. UP:\n   - The snake would move to (0, 1).\n   - This is a valid move.\n   - There's no apple at (0, 1), so the snake wouldn't grow.\n\nThe best strategy is to move towards the apples. Since all the apples are to the right of the snake, moving RIGHT seems like the best option.\n\nAfter moving RIGHT (to (1, 2)), we could continue moving RIGHT to get closer to the apples on the right side of the board. We could also think about moving UP to get closer to the apple at (0, 5).\n\nGiven this, the best direction is RIGHT.\n\nLet me draw the board again to confirm my interpretation:\n\n```\nPosition (0,0) -> #########\nPosition (0,1) -> #    A #\nPosition (0,2) -> # H    #\nPosition (0,3) -> # SS   #\nPosition (0,4) -> #    A #\nPosition (0,5) -> #     A#\nPosition (0,6) -> #      #\nPosition (0,7) -> ########\n```\n\nThis doesn't look right. Let me try again with a different notation:\n\nRow 0: ########\nRow 1: #    A #\nRow 2: # H    #\nRow 3: # SS   #\nRow 4: #    A #\nRow 5: #     A#\nRow 6: #      #\nRow 7: ########\n\nGiven this, I'll use the notation (row, col):\nThe head 'H' is at (2, 2).\nThe body segments 'S' are at (3, 2) and (3, 3).\n\nWait, this doesn't look like a snake either. Let me try to clarify one more time:\n\nThe board is:\n```\n########\n#    A #\n# H    #\n# SS   #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nLet's call the top-left position of the board (0, 0). Then:\n- At position (1, 1), there's a space.\n- At position (1, 6), there's an apple 'A'.\n- At position (2, 1), there's a space.\n- At position (2, 2), there's the snake's head 'H'.\n...and so on.\n\nWith this notation, the snake's head is at (2, 2). The body segments 'S' are at (3, 1) and (3, 2).\n\nBut this still doesn't make a snake. \n\nLet me use a different approach:\n\n```\n01234567 <- column indices\n0########\n1#    A #\n2# H    #\n3# SS   #\n4#    A #\n5#     A#\n6#      #\n7########\n```\n\nStarting with the snake's head 'H' at position (2, 2) and the current direction being UP, the snake is moving from position (3, 2) to position (2, 2). This would mean the body 'S' at position (3, 2) was previously the head, and the 'S' at position (3, 1) is from a step before.\n\nBut this doesn't make sense because the 'S' at position (3, 1) isn't connected to the 'S' at position (3, 2).\n\nI'm having a hard time understanding the exact configuration of the snake. But based on the information:\n- The head 'H' is at (2, 2).\n- There are two body segments 'S', which I believe are at (3, 2) and (3, 3) (but I'm not sure anymore).\n- The current direction is UP, which means the snake is moving from a lower row to a higher row.\n\nJudging by the current direction, the snake is moving from positions with higher row indices to positions with lower row indices. If I think of the snake's movement, the head 'H' was probably at position (3, 2) in the previous step, and at (4, 2) before that. This would mean the body parts 'S' are at positions (3, 2) and (4, 2), but the board shows 'SS' at positions (3, 2) and (3, 3), which confuses me.\n\nLet's try one more interpretation:\n\n```\n  01234567 <- column indices\n0 ########\n1 #    A # <- y=1\n2 # H    # <- y=2\n3 # SS   # <- y=3\n4 #    A # <- y=4\n5 #     A# <- y=5\n6 #      # <- y=6\n7 ########\n```\n\nIf we use (row, column) notation with 0-based indexing (where (0, 0) is the top-left corner of the board):\nThe head 'H' is at (2, 2).\nThere are two 'S' characters at (3, 2) and (3, 3).\n\nIf the current direction is UP, it means the snake is moving from higher row values to lower row values (i.e., from bottom to top).\n\nGiven that the head 'H' is at (2, 2), and the direction is UP, in the previous step, the head was probably at (3, 2). And in the step before that, the head was at (3, 3). This would explain the 'S' characters at those positions.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible moves:\n\n1. LEFT:\n   - The snake would move to (2, 1).\n   - This is a valid move.\n   - There's no apple at (2, 1), so the snake wouldn't grow.\n\n2. RIGHT:\n   - The snake would move to (2, 3).\n   - This is a valid move.\n   - There's no apple at (2, 3), so the snake wouldn't grow.\n\n3. UP:\n   - The snake would move to (1, 2).\n   - This is a valid move.\n   - There's no apple at (1, 2), so the snake wouldn't grow.\n\nFor the long-term strategy, we need to head towards the apples.\n\nThe apples are at:\n- (1, 6).\n- (4, 6).\n- (5, 7).\n\nIf we move the snake RIGHT, we're moving towards the right side of the board, which is where the apples are located. This would allow us to potentially reach all three apples more efficiently.\n\nSo, the best direction is RIGHT.\n\nActually this doesn't make sense either. Why? I was assuming that the current direction of the snake is UP (i.e., moving from bottom to top). The problem says \"The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head).\" So I was expecting that the snake's tail would be in the direction opposite to the one it's moving in. But if the snake is growing (which it does when it eats apples), then the tail doesn't necessarily move; new segments are added at the position where the head was.\n\nSo, let's think about this:\n- Head 'H' is at (2, 2).\n- There are two 'S' characters at (3, 2) and (3, 3).\n- Current direction is UP, meaning the snake is moving towards the top of the board (from higher row values to lower row values).\n\nHmm, I'm still not seeing a clear path from the head to the two 'S' characters. Let me re-read the board.\n\nAh, now I see it:\n\n```\n  01234567 <- column indices\n0 ########\n1 #    A # <- y=1\n2 # H    # <- y=2\n3 # SS   # <- y=3\n4 #    A # <- y=4\n5 #     A# <- y=5\n6 #      # <- y=6\n7 ########\n```\n\nI see the head at (2, 2), and I see \"SS\" at (3, 2) and (3, 3). But I was thinking the 'S' at (3, 3) was the second segment of the snake. But if I read the board as the snake moving UP, then the last two positions of the head were (3, 2) and (4, 2). But there's no 'S' at (4, 2), there's an empty space. This is confusing.\n\nLet me try to understand the instructions again. The snake starts with a length of 1, just the head. The head is represented by 'H', and the body by 'S'. The snake moves one square at a time. Each time the snake eats an apple, it grows in length.\n\nOK, I think I understand now. \n\nBased on the puzzle description and your example, I can see the snake is a vertical snake, with the head at (2,2), pointing upward, with body segments at (3,2) and (3,3).\n\nWait, I can't fit the body segment at (3, 3) into this picture. Let me double check the board again:\n\n```\n  01234567 <- column indices\n0 ########\n1 #    A # <- y=1\n2 # H    # <- y=2\n3 # SS   # <- y=3\n4 #    A # <- y=4\n5 #     A# <- y=5\n6 #      # <- y=6\n7 ########\n```\n\nThe head 'H' is at (2, 2), and there are two 'S' characters at (3, 1) and (3, 2).\n\nOk, I still don't understand what's going on with the body of the snake. Let me reread the instructions one more time.\n\nI don't think I'm reading the board correctly. Let me try a different approach:\n\n```\n########\n#    A #\n# H    #\n# SS   #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nIn this board, the head 'H' is immediately below the space under the top wall. There are two 'S' characters vertically below the head. This makes the snake look like a vertical line with the head at the top, which makes sense if the current direction is UP.\n\nLet me clarify the positions:\n- The head 'H' is at the position (row=2, col=2).\n- The two body segments 'S' are at positions (row=3, col=2) and not sure about the other one. It's not clear from the board. It should be at (row=4, col=2), but it's not visible in the board. Wait, it is actually visible. There are two 'S' characters on row 3. I'm not sure if I'm reading this correctly.\n\nYou know what, let's try my own notation:\n\n```\n|01234567| <- column indices\n+--------+\n0|########|\n1|#    A #|\n2|# H    #|\n3|# SS   #|\n4|#    A #|\n5|#     A#|\n6|#      #|\n7|########|\n+--------+\n```\n\nWith this, the head 'H' is at position (row=2, col=2). The two body segments 'S' are stacked horizontally at positions (row=3, col=2) and (row=3, col=3). But this is strange because the snake shouldn't have a bend in its body like this, especially if it's been moving UP.\n\nWait, I might be misreading the 'S' characters. Let me be super clear. In row 3, column 2 (counting from 0 and including the walls), there's an 'S'. And immediately to the right of it, also in row 3, there's another 'S'. Is this correct?\n\nLet me re-read the board with a more explicit approach:\nrow 0: ########\nrow 1: #    A #\nrow 2: # H    #\nrow 3: # SS   #\nrow 4: #    A #\nrow 5: #     A#\nrow 6: #      #\nrow 7: ########\n\nOK, so:\n- In row 1, column 5, there's an apple ('A').\n- In row 2, column 2, there's the snake's head ('H').\n- In row 3, column 2, there's a snake body segment ('S').\n- In row 3, column 3, there's another snake body segment ('S').\n\nNow I understand. The snake looks like this:\n```\n  H\n S\nS\n```\nIt's sort of an L-shaped snake with the head moving upwards. OK, that matches the rule that \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\"\n\nSo right now, the head is at (2, 2) and moving up, so the next position would be at row 1, column 2.\n\nAlright, now let's analyze each possible move:\n\n1. LEFT:\n   - The snake would move to (2, 1).\n   - This is a valid move.\n   - There's no apple at (2, 1), so the snake wouldn't grow.\n   - The tail would move to the position where the second-to-last segment was.\n\n2. RIGHT:\n   - The snake would move to (2, 3).\n   - This is a valid move.\n   - There's no apple at (2, 3), so the snake wouldn't grow.\n   - The tail would move to the position where the second-to-last segment was.\n\n3. UP:\n   - The snake would move to (1, 2).\n   - This is a valid move.\n   - There's no apple at (1, 2), so the snake wouldn't grow.\n   - The tail would move to the position where the second-to-last segment was.\n\nFor the long-term strategy, moving towards the apples is the best. The apples are at:\n- (1, 5).\n- (4, 5).\n- (5, 6).\n\nOK, let's start over. Actually I think I was reading the board correctly all along. I'll use 0-indexing throughout:\n\nThe board:\n```\n  01234567\n +--------+\n0|########|\n1|#    A #|\n2|# H    #|\n3|# SS   #|\n4|#    A #|\n5|#     A#|\n6|#      #|\n7|########|\n +--------+\n  01234567\n```\n\nIf I count (again using 0-indexing), I observe that:\n- In row 1, column 5, there's an apple ('A').\n- In row 2, column 2, there's the snake's head ('H').\n- In row 3, column 2, there's a snake body segment ('S').\n- In row 3, column 3, there's another snake body segment ('S').\n\nGiven that the head is at (2, 2) and the current direction is UP, the next step in the same direction would be (1, 2). The two 'S' characters represent the body of the snake, but I'm having trouble visualizing how the snake's body is shaped. Maybe I should read the example in the instructions more carefully.\n\nFrom the example:\n```\n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\nThe head 'H' is at (3, 1), and there's a single body segment 'S' at (2, 1). The current direction isn't specified, but if you give the direction DOWN, the next state of the board would be:\n```\n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\nHere, the head 'H' has moved to (4, 1), the first body segment 'S' has moved to (3, 1), and another body segment 'S' has been added at (2, 1) (where the first body segment was before). The snake has grown because it ate an apple.\n\nThis makes sense; the snake's body follows the path the head has taken.\n\nBack to the original puzzle:\n```\n  01234567\n +--------+\n0|########|\n1|#    A #|\n2|# H    #|\n3|# SS   #|\n4|#    A #|\n5|#     A#|\n6|#      #|\n7|########|\n +--------+\n  01234567\n```\n\nGiven the structure I see, with the head at (2, 2) and the two body segments at (3, 2) and (3, 3), it seems like the snake might have moved like this:\n\nInitial position:\n```\n  01234567\n +--------+\n0|########|\n1|#    A #|\n2|#      #|\n3|# H    #|\n4|# S    #|\n5|#     A#|\n6|#      #|\n7|########|\n +--------+\n  01234567\n```\n\nThen the snake's head moved from (3, 2) to (2, 2), the body segment followed to (3, 2), and for some reason, there's a new body segment at (3, 3). But this doesn't follow the rule of the snake's body following the path of the head.\n\nMy only confusion is the body segment at (3, 3). The \"S\" at (3, 2) makes sense with the snake's head at (2, 2) and moving UP.\n\nMaybe I'm overthinking this, and the puzzle just has a specific snake configuration for me to work with, regardless of its history. Taking the snake as it is:\n- Head at (2, 2).\n- Body segments at (3, 2) and (3, 3).\n- Current direction is UP.\n\nI'll consider the possible moves:\n\n1. LEFT:\n   - The snake would move to (2, 1).\n   - This is a valid move.\n   - There's no apple at (2, 1), so the snake wouldn't grow.\n\n2. RIGHT:\n   - The snake would move to (2, 3).\n   - This is a valid move.\n   - There's no apple at (2, 3), so the snake wouldn't grow.\n\n3. UP:\n   - The snake would move to (1, 2).\n   - This is a valid move.\n   - There's no apple at (1, 2), so the snake wouldn't grow.\n\nOK, my assessment is that I should choose a move based on where the apples are. Let's look at the apples again. The apples are at:\n- (1, 5).\n- (4, 5).\n- (5, 6).\n\nI want to eat as many apples as possible, so I need to think about the path towards the apples.\n\nIf I move RIGHT, I'll be closer to the apple at (1, 5). After moving RIGHT, I could move UP (which would be moving rightward) and potentially reach that apple.\n\nIf I move LEFT, I'll be moving away from all the apples.\n\nIf I move UP, I'll be closer to the apple at (1, 5), but I'd still need to move quite a bit to the right after that.\n\nLooking at the overall board, most of the apples are on the right side. So, it seems most strategic to move RIGHT for now.\n\nDirection to move: RIGHTLooking at the game board:\n\n```\n########\n#    A #\n# H    #\n# SS   #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nI need to decide which direction to move the snake to maximize its chances of eating apples and avoid collisions.\n\nAnalyzing the situation:\n- The snake head (H) is at position (2,2)\n- There are two body segments (S) at positions (3,2) and (3,3)\n- There are three apples (A) on the board at positions (1,5), (4,5), and (5,6)\n- The snake is currently moving UP\n\nI can move LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP (I can't move DOWN since that would reverse the snake's direction).\n\nLooking at the apple positions, all apples are towards the right side of the board. If I move RIGHT, I'll be heading in the direction of more apples. This gives me the best chance to reach multiple apples efficiently.\n\nMoving UP would keep me moving away from most apples, and moving LEFT would take me toward the wall with no apples in that direction.\n\nTherefore, I'll choose to move RIGHT to begin navigating toward the apples.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Let me review the game board:\n\n```\n########\n#    A #\n# SH   #\n# S    #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nThe snake consists of:\n- The head 'H' at position (2, 3) (row 2, column 3, 0-indexed)\n- Body segments 'S' at positions (2, 1) and (3, 1)\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT, which means the snake is moving to the right.\n\nThe apples 'A' are located at:\n- (1, 6)\n- (4, 6)\n- (5, 7)\n\nI need to decide which direction to move. Since the snake is currently moving RIGHT, I can choose to continue moving RIGHT, or turn UP or DOWN. I cannot move LEFT because that would be a reverse of the current direction.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n1. RIGHT: If I move right, the snake's head will move to position (2, 4), which is an empty space. This is safe.\n2. UP: If I move up, the snake's head will move to position (1, 3), which is also an empty space. This is safe.\n3. DOWN: If I move down, the snake's head will move to position (3, 3), which is an empty space. This is also safe.\n\nNow, let's consider which direction will bring me closer to an apple. The closest apple is at (1, 6), which is 4 steps away if I move RIGHT first and then UP. I can also approach it by moving UP first and then RIGHT.\n\nIf I move RIGHT, I'll get closer to the apples at (1, 6) horizontally.\nIf I move UP, I'll get closer to the apple at (1, 6) vertically.\nIf I move DOWN, I'll move away from the apple at (1, 6) but might be positioning myself for the apple at (4, 6) later.\n\nI think the best move is to continue moving RIGHT to get closer to the apple at (1, 6). After a few moves, I can then move UP to eat it.\n\nMy answer is: RIGHTGame board:\n```\n########\n#    A #\n# SH   #\n# S    #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nI need to decide the best direction for the snake to move. Currently, the snake is moving RIGHT and its head is at the 'H' position.\n\nLooking at the board, I can see:\n- The snake has its head (H) at position (2,3)\n- There are snake body segments (S) at (2,1) and (3,1)\n- There are apples (A) at (1,6), (4,6), and (5,7)\n\nSince the snake is moving RIGHT, I can continue moving RIGHT or turn UP or DOWN. I cannot move LEFT as that would reverse the snake's direction.\n\nIf I move RIGHT, I'll be one step closer to the apple at (1,6), which I can reach by continuing right and then moving up.\n\nMoving UP would be another option to approach the apple at (1,6), but would require more right moves afterward.\n\nMoving DOWN would take me away from the closest apple and isn't optimal right now.\n\nI choose to continue moving RIGHT to get closer to the apple at (1,6).\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Let me first analyze the current game board:\n\n```\n########\n#    A #\n# SSH  #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 6\n\nIn this board:\n- The snake head 'H' is located at position (2, 5) (assuming 0-based indexing and (row, column) format)\n- The snake body 'S' parts are at positions (2, 2), (2, 3), and (2, 4)\n- There are three apples 'A' at positions (1, 5), (4, 5), and (5, 6)\n- The current direction is RIGHT, meaning the snake is moving to the right\n\nI need to decide which direction to move next. Since the snake can't reverse its direction, I can't choose LEFT (since the current direction is RIGHT).\n\nMy options are:\n1. RIGHT - Continue moving right\n2. UP - Turn upward\n3. DOWN - Turn downward\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n1. RIGHT: If I move right, the snake head will move from (2, 5) to (2, 6). This is an empty space, so the snake won't die. However, it won't eat an apple either.\n\n2. UP: If I move up, the snake head will move from (2, 5) to (1, 5). This position contains an apple 'A', so the snake will eat the apple and grow.\n\n3. DOWN: If I move down, the snake head will move from (2, 5) to (3, 5). This is an empty space, so the snake won't die. However, it won't eat an apple either.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best option seems to be UP, as it allows the snake to eat an apple and grow, which increases the score by 1.\n\nTherefore, my answer is \"UP\".\n\nActually, let me double-check the coordinates. It's a bit confusing with 0-based vs. 1-based indexing, and also the orientation of the board (is the first row at the top or bottom?).\n\n```\n########  -- row 0 (top)\n#    A #  -- row 1\n# SSH  #  -- row 2\n#      #  -- row 3\n#    A #  -- row 4\n#     A#  -- row 5\n#      #  -- row 6\n########  -- row 7 (bottom)\n```\n\nAnd looking at columns:\n```\n0123456 (column indices)\n########\n#    A #\n# SSH  #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nSo the snake head 'H' is at position (2, 4), the snake body 'S' parts are at positions (2, 1), (2, 2), and (2, 3), and the apples 'A' are at positions (1, 5), (4, 5), and (5, 6).\n\nWait, I should be more careful with the indexing. Let me try again with 1-based indexing for clarity:\n\n```\n(1,1)(1,2)(1,3)(1,4)(1,5)(1,6)(1,7)(1,8)  -- row 1 (top)\n  #    #    #    #    #    #    #    #\n(2,1)(2,2)(2,3)(2,4)(2,5)(2,6)(2,7)(2,8)  -- row 2\n  #              A              #\n(3,1)(3,2)(3,3)(3,4)(3,5)(3,6)(3,7)(3,8)  -- row 3\n  #         S    S    H         #\n(4,1)(4,2)(4,3)(4,4)(4,5)(4,6)(4,7)(4,8)  -- row 4\n  #                             #\n(5,1)(5,2)(5,3)(5,4)(5,5)(5,6)(5,7)(5,8)  -- row 5\n  #                   A         #\n(6,1)(6,2)(6,3)(6,4)(6,5)(6,6)(6,7)(6,8)  -- row 6\n  #                        A    #\n(7,1)(7,2)(7,3)(7,4)(7,5)(7,6)(7,7)(7,8)  -- row 7\n  #                             #\n(8,1)(8,2)(8,3)(8,4)(8,5)(8,6)(8,7)(8,8)  -- row 8 (bottom)\n  #    #    #    #    #    #    #    #\n```\n\nOK, now I see more clearly:\n- The snake head 'H' is at position (3, 5)\n- The snake body 'S' parts are at positions (3, 3) and (3, 4)\n- There are apples 'A' at positions (2, 6), (5, 6), and (6, 7)\n- The current direction is RIGHT\n\nGiven this clearer picture, let's analyze the options again:\n\n1. RIGHT: If I move right, the snake head will move from (3, 5) to (3, 6). This is an empty space and not an immediate apple, but it gets me closer to the apple at (2, 6).\n\n2. UP: If I move up, the snake head will move from (3, 5) to (2, 5). This is an empty space, and it gets me closer to the apple at (2, 6).\n\n3. DOWN: If I move down, the snake head will move from (3, 5) to (4, 5). This is an empty space, and it moves towards the apple at (5, 6).\n\nI think the best strategy is to go UP first, then RIGHT to eat the apple at (2, 6). So my answer is \"UP\".\n\nWait, I'm still getting confused with the coordinates. Let's try again with a simpler approach. I'll just name the positions based on relative directions:\n\n- The snake head 'H' is in the middle of the board, with the body 'S' extending to the left.\n- There's an apple 'A' above and slightly to the right of the head.\n- There's an apple 'A' below and to the right of the head.\n- There's an apple 'A' further below and to the right of the head, near the bottom-right corner.\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT, meaning the snake is moving to the right.\n\nNow let's analyze the options:\n\n1. RIGHT: Continue moving right. This is a safe move and brings me closer to the wall, but doesn't immediately lead to any apples.\n\n2. UP: Turn upward. This brings me closer to the apple above and slightly to the right.\n\n3. DOWN: Turn downward. This brings me closer to the apple below and to the right.\n\nI think the best strategy is to go UP first, then RIGHT to eat the apple above. So my answer is \"UP\".\n\nActually, let me stare at the board again:\n\n```\n########\n#    A #\n# SSH  #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n```\n\n- The snake head 'H' is at the end of \"SSH\" in row 3.\n- There's an apple 'A' at the end of row 2.\n- There's an apple 'A' in the same column as the head, but in row 5.\n- There's an apple 'A' at the end of row 6.\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, the head will move one space to the right, which is an empty space.\nIf I go UP, the head will move up one row, which would put it in the same position as the apple in row 2.\nIf I go DOWN, the head will move down one row, which is an empty space.\n\nBased on this, the best move is to go UP to eat the apple.\n\nTherefore, my answer is \"UP\".\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me name the positions in a more traditional way:\n\n```\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n  ----------------\n0 |# # # # # # # #|\n1 |#       A     #|\n2 |# S S H       #|\n3 |#             #|\n4 |#       A     #|\n5 |#         A   #|\n6 |#             #|\n7 |# # # # # # # #|\n```\n\nSo:\n- The snake head 'H' is at position (2, 3)\n- The snake body 'S' parts are at positions (2, 1) and (2, 2)\n- There are apples 'A' at positions (1, 6), (4, 6), and (5, 7)\n- The current direction is RIGHT\n\nWait, this doesn't match the board I was given. Let me try again:\n\n```\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n  ----------------\n0 |# # # # # # # #|\n1 |#       A     #|\n2 |# S S H       #|\n3 |#             #|\n4 |#       A     #|\n5 |#         A   #|\n6 |#             #|\n7 |# # # # # # # #|\n```\n\nNo, that's not right either. Let me really focus on the exact board I was given:\n\n```\n########\n#    A #\n# SSH  #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nLet's count the positions carefully:\n- The snake head 'H' is in the 3rd row, 6th position.\n- There's an apple 'A' in the 2nd row, 6th position (right above the head).\n- There's an apple 'A' in the 5th row, 6th position.\n- There's an apple 'A' in the 6th row, 7th position.\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT.\n\nIf I go UP, the head will move to the 2nd row, 6th position, which contains an apple.\nSo, the best move is to go UP to eat the apple.\n\nTherefore, my answer is \"UP\".\n\nActually, let me be even more precise and count the positions from the top left, ignoring the walls:\n\n```\n012345\n0######\n1#    A#  - row 1\n2# SSH #  - row 2\n3#     #  - row 3\n4#    A#  - row 4\n5#     A#  - row 5\n6#     #  - row 6\n7######\n```\n\nSo:\n- The snake head 'H' is at (2, 4) (row 2, column 4).\n- There's an apple 'A' at (1, 5) (row 1, column 5).\n- There's an apple 'A' at (4, 5) (row 4, column 5).\n- There's an apple 'A' at (5, 6) (row 5, column 6).\n\nIf I go UP from (2, 4), I would move to (1, 4), which is not where the apple is. The apple is at (1, 5).\n\nIf I go RIGHT from (2, 4), I would move to (2, 5), which doesn't have an apple.\n\nSo, the best strategy would be to go RIGHT first, then UP to eat the apple at (1, 5).\n\nHowever, we are only making one move at a time, and the current direction is RIGHT. Given the options, I should choose RIGHT.\n\nActually, I think I'm getting confused because I'm trying to figure out if 'H' is positioned at the start or end of the \"SSH\" sequence. Let me look at the notation more carefully.\n\nIn Snake games, typically the head 'H' is at the front of the snake, and the body segments 'S' follow behind. So, in the notation \"SSH\", the head would be at the end (the rightmost 'H'), and the body segments would be the 'S's before it.\n\nGiven that, and considering the current direction is RIGHT, the head 'H' is indeed at (2, 5) when counting from the top left (including the walls).\n\nIf I go UP from (2, 5), I would move to (1, 5), which has an apple 'A'.\n\nTherefore, my answer is \"UP\".\n\nWait, I have one more confusion. Let me make sure I understand the notation correctly.\n\n```\n########\n#    A #  - row 1\n# SSH  #  - row 2\n#      #  - row 3\n#    A #  - row 4\n#     A#  - row 5\n#      #  - row 6\n########\n```\n\nThe snake head 'H' is at the end of \"SSH\", so that's at row 2, column 5 (counting from 1 and including the walls). The current direction is RIGHT, which means the snake is moving from left to right.\n\nIf I go UP from row 2, column 5, I would move to row 1, column 5, which has an apple 'A'.\n\nTherefore, my answer is \"UP\".\n\nActually, let me just do one more check on the actual positions of the snake head, body, and apples.\n\nUsing 0-based indexing (ignoring the walls):\n```\n0123456\n########\n#    A #  - row 0\n# SSH  #  - row 1\n#      #  - row 2\n#    A #  - row 3\n#     A#  - row 4\n#      #  - row 5\n########\n```\n\n- The snake head 'H' is at (1, 3).\n- The snake body 'S' parts are at (1, 1) and (1, 2).\n- There are apples 'A' at (0, 4), (3, 4), and (4, 5).\n\nUsing 1-based indexing (ignoring the walls):\n```\n1234567\n########\n#    A #  - row 1\n# SSH  #  - row 2\n#      #  - row 3\n#    A #  - row 4\n#     A#  - row 5\n#      #  - row 6\n########\n```\n\n- The snake head 'H' is at (2, 4).\n- The snake body 'S' parts are at (2, 2) and (2, 3).\n- There are apples 'A' at (1, 5), (4, 5), and (5, 6).\n\nOK, I see what's happening. I'm making a critical error. The snake head is not at the end of \"SSH\". The snake head is 'H', and the body segments are 'S'. In the notation \"SSH\", the head 'H' is at the right, and the body segments 'S' are to the left. This is consistent with the snake moving RIGHT.\n\nWith that understanding, if the head 'H' is at row 2, column 4 (using 1-based indexing and ignoring the walls), then:\n\nIf I go UP from (2, 4), I would move to (1, 4), which does not have an apple.\nIf I go RIGHT from (2, 4), I would move to (2, 5), which does not have an apple.\nIf I go DOWN from (2, 4), I would move to (3, 4), which does not have an apple.\n\nSince I'm currently moving RIGHT, the best strategy would be to continue RIGHT and then go UP to eat the apple at (1, 5).\n\nGiven the options, I should choose RIGHT.\n\nHmm, I think I'm making an error again. Let me very carefully label the positions of each character in the board, including the walls:\n\n```\n01234567\n0########  - row 0\n1#    A #  - row 1\n2# SSH  #  - row 2\n3#      #  - row 3\n4#    A #  - row 4\n5#     A#  - row 5\n6#      #  - row 6\n7########  - row 7\n```\n\nThe 'S' characters are at (2, 2) and (2, 3). The 'H' character is at (2, 4). The 'A' characters are at (1, 6), (4, 6), and (5, 7).\n\nOK, so the snake head 'H' is currently at position (2, 4). The current direction is RIGHT.\n\nIf I move UP, the head will move to (1, 4), which is an empty space.\nIf I move RIGHT, the head will move to (2, 5), which is also an empty space.\nIf I move DOWN, the head will move to (3, 4), which is also an empty space.\n\nNone of these moves lead directly to an apple. However, moving RIGHT will bring me closer to the apple at (1, 6), which I can then reach by going UP.\n\nActually, let me count one more time, being super careful:\n```\n01234567  (column)\n0########\n1#    A #  - row 1\n2# SSH  #  - row 2\n3#      #  - row 3\n4#    A #  - row 4\n5#     A#  - row 5\n6#      #  - row 6\n7########\n```\n\n- '#' is at (0, 0) through (0, 7), (1, 0), (1, 7), and so on (the walls).\n- 'S' is at (2, 1) and (2, 2).\n- 'S' is at (2, 3).\n- 'H' is at (2, 4).\n- 'A' is at (1, 5).\n- 'A' is at (4, 5).\n- 'A' is at (5, 6).\n\nGiven this, if I move UP from (2, 4), I would go to (1, 4), which is empty.\nIf I move RIGHT from (2, 4), I would go to (2, 5), which is empty.\nIf I move DOWN from (2, 4), I would go to (3, 4), which is empty.\n\nSince we have to move at each step, and considering both the immediate move and future moves, the best strategy would be to go UP now, and then RIGHT in the next move to eat the apple at (1, 5).\n\nTherefore, my answer is \"UP\".\n\nActually, let's try one more time, marking the exact positions of each character. I'll use (row, column) format:\n\n```\n(0,0)(0,1)(0,2)(0,3)(0,4)(0,5)(0,6)(0,7)\n  #    #    #    #    #    #    #    #\n(1,0)(1,1)(1,2)(1,3)(1,4)(1,5)(1,6)(1,7)\n  #                   A         #\n(2,0)(2,1)(2,2)(2,3)(2,4)(2,5)(2,6)(2,7)\n  #    S    S    H              #\n(3,0)(3,1)(3,2)(3,3)(3,4)(3,5)(3,6)(3,7)\n  #                             #\n(4,0)(4,1)(4,2)(4,3)(4,4)(4,5)(4,6)(4,7)\n  #                   A         #\n(5,0)(5,1)(5,2)(5,3)(5,4)(5,5)(5,6)(5,7)\n  #                        A    #\n(6,0)(6,1)(6,2)(6,3)(6,4)(6,5)(6,6)(6,7)\n  #                             #\n(7,0)(7,1)(7,2)(7,3)(7,4)(7,5)(7,6)(7,7)\n  #    #    #    #    #    #    #    #\n```\n\nBased on this, the snake head 'H' is at (2, 3). The current direction is RIGHT.\n\nWait, this still doesn't match the board I was given. Let me count the positions in the original board one more time, and be super precise:\n\n```\n########\n#    A #\n# SSH  #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nOK, in a simple count, the 'H' is at the 3rd position on the 3rd row (counting the wall as the first position). This would be position (2, 3) in 0-based indexing.\n\nBut I'm getting confused because the spaces don't seem to align properly. Let me add numbers to make it clearer:\n\n```\n01234567\n0########\n1#    A #\n2# SSH  #\n3#      #\n4#    A #\n5#     A#\n6#      #\n7########\n```\n\nNow, the 'H' is at position (2, 4).\nThe 'S' characters are at (2, 2) and (2, 3).\nThe 'A' characters are at (1, 5), (4, 5), and (5, 6).\n\nOK, if the head 'H' is at (2, 4) and the current direction is RIGHT:\n\nIf I move UP, the head will move to (1, 4), which is an empty space, and I'll be one step away from the apple at (1, 5).\nIf I move RIGHT, the head will move to (2, 5), which is also an empty space, but I won't be closer to any apple.\nIf I move DOWN, the head will move to (3, 4), which is also an empty space, and I'll be one step away from the apple at (4, 5).\n\nGiven these options, both UP and DOWN bring me closer to an apple. But going UP allows me to reach an apple with a simple RIGHT move in the next step, whereas going DOWN requires more steps to reach the apple.\n\nTherefore, my answer is \"UP\".\n\nAh, I think I'm miscounting the spaces. There are always extra spaces I'm adding to the board when I write it out. But I really should just print the board exactly as it is:\n\n```\n########\n#    A #\n# SSH  #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nLet's count the positions:\n- 'S' are at positions (2, 2) and (2, 3). (Let's confirm: There's a space, then an S, then another S, so that's positions 1, 2, 3 on the 3rd row, using 0-based indexing).\n- 'H' is at position (2, 4). (That's right after the second 'S').\n- 'A' are at positions (1, 5), (4, 5), and (5, 6).\n- The current direction is RIGHT.\n\nSo, if I move UP from (2, 4), I go to (1, 4), which is one step away from the apple at (1, 5).\nIf I move RIGHT from (2, 4), I go to (2, 5), which is an empty space.\nIf I move DOWN from (2, 4), I go to (3, 4), which is also an empty space.\n\nThe best strategy is to go UP, and then RIGHT in the next move to eat the apple at (1, 5).\n\nTherefore, my answer is \"UP\".\n\nAlright, I've done this multiple times now and I'm getting the same answer. The best move is to go UP. This brings me closer to an apple, which I can eat in the next move by going RIGHT.\n\nWhew, that was a bit confusing, but I think I have the right answer now: UP.Game board:\n```\n########\n#    A #\n# SSH  #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nLooking at the current game board, I can see the snake head 'H' is at the right end of the snake, with two body segments 'S' to its left. The snake is currently moving RIGHT.\n\nThere are three apples on the board:\n1. One apple directly above and slightly to the right of the snake's head\n2. One apple below and to the right of the snake's head\n3. One apple near the bottom-right corner of the playable area\n\nMy goal is to eat as many apples as possible without colliding with walls or myself. Since I'm currently moving RIGHT, I have three possible moves: continue RIGHT, turn UP, or turn DOWN.\n\nIf I move UP, I'll position myself one step away from the first apple, which I can then eat on my next move by going RIGHT.\n\nIf I continue RIGHT, I'll move away from the closest apple.\n\nIf I move DOWN, I'll be heading toward the second apple, but it will take more moves to reach.\n\nThe best strategic move is to go UP, which will allow me to eat an apple in the next turn.\n\nAnswer: UP","HTTPError 529: {\"error\":{\"message\":\"-4316: Overloaded\",\"code\":\"-4307\"}}"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

There are three apples (A) on the board:\n1. One at the top-left corner (row 1, column 1)\n2. One in the middle-left (row 3, column 2)\n3. One at the right side of the 5th row (row 5, column 7)\n\nSince the snake is currently moving UP and cannot reverse direction (can't go DOWN), our options are:\n- Continue moving UP\n- Turn LEFT\n- Turn RIGHT\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n1. UP: If we move UP, the snake will move to the position (row 4, column 3). There's no apple there, so we won't eat anything.\n\n2. LEFT: If we move LEFT, the snake will move to the position (row 5, column 2). There's no apple there either.\n\n3. RIGHT: If we move RIGHT, the snake will move to the position (row 5, column 4). There's no apple there either.\n\nNone of the immediate moves will result in eating an apple. However, we need to consider which direction brings us closer to an apple.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distance to each apple:\n\nFor the apple at (1,1):\n- From UP move (4,3): |4-1| + |3-1| = 3 + 2 = 5\n- From LEFT move (5,2): |5-1| + |2-1| = 4 + 1 = 5\n- From RIGHT move (5,4): |5-1| + |4-1| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\nFor the apple at (3,2):\n- From UP move (4,3): |4-3| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- From LEFT move (5,2): |5-3| + |2-2| = 2 + 0 = 2\n- From RIGHT move (5,4): |5-3| + |4-2| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nFor the apple at (5,7):\n- From UP move (4,3): |4-5| + |3-7| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- From LEFT move (5,2): |5-5| + |2-7| = 0 + 5 = 5\n- From RIGHT move (5,4): |5-5| + |4-7| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\nLooking at these distances, we can see that:\n- Moving UP gets us closest to the apple at (3,2) with a distance of 2.\n- Moving LEFT also gets us a distance of 2 to the apple at (3,2).\n- Moving RIGHT gets us closest to the apple at (5,7) with a distance of 3.\n\nSince the apple at (3,2) is closest, we might want to prioritize reaching it. Both UP and LEFT provide the same distance, but UP seems more direct. Let's choose UP.\n\nHowever, let's also think strategically. Since the snake is currently just a head (length 1), we have flexibility. Going for the closest apple is generally a good strategy, but we might also want to consider longer-term planning.\n\nGiven the current board state and the snake's length of 1, I'll choose UP to get closer to the apple at (3,2).\n\nActually, let me make a correction. Looking at the board again:\n```\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#  H  A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nThe apple positions are:\n1. One at the top-left corner (row 1, column 1) - This is actually at coordinates (1,1)\n2. One in the middle-left (row 3, column 2) - This is actually at coordinates (3,2)\n3. One at the right side of the 5th row (row 4, column 7) - This is actually at coordinates (4,7)\n\nLet me recalculate the distances with these corrected positions.\n\nWait, I think I misread the coordinates. Let me double-check by assigning coordinates to each position on the board:\n\n```\n  01234567\n0 ########\n1 #A     #\n2 #      #\n3 # A    #\n4 #  H  A#\n5 #      #\n6 #      #\n7 ########\n```\n\nSo, the apple positions are:\n1. Top-left: (1,1)\n2. Middle-left: (3,2)\n3. Right side of the 4th row: (4,6)\n\nAnd the snake's head is at (4,3).\n\nNow, let's recalculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\nFor the apple at (1,1):\n- From UP move (3,3): |3-1| + |3-1| = 2 + 2 = 4\n- From LEFT move (4,2): |4-1| + |2-1| = 3 + 1 = 4\n- From RIGHT move (4,4): |4-1| + |4-1| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nFor the apple at (3,2):\n- From UP move (3,3): |3-3| + |3-2| = 0 + 1 = 1\n- From LEFT move (4,2): |4-3| + |2-2| = 1 + 0 = 1\n- From RIGHT move (4,4): |4-3| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nFor the apple at (4,6):\n- From UP move (3,3): |3-4| + |3-6| = 1 + 3 = 4\n- From LEFT move (4,2): |4-4| + |2-6| = 0 + 4 = 4\n- From RIGHT move (4,4): |4-4| + |4-6| = 0 + 2 = 2\n\nFrom these distances, I can see that:\n- Moving UP gets us closest to the apple at (3,2) with a distance of 1.\n- Moving LEFT also gets us a distance of 1 to the apple at (3,2).\n- Moving RIGHT gets us closest to the apple at (4,6) with a distance of 2.\n\nThe apple at (3,2) is the closest, and both UP and LEFT provide the same distance.\n\nGiven that both UP and LEFT give us the same distance to the closest apple, I'll choose UP because it allows us more flexibility in subsequent moves.\n\nActually, wait. Let me double-check the coordinates once more. The board is:\n\n```\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#  H  A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nUsing 0-based indexing for rows and columns, the coordinates would be:\n\nSnake's head (H): (4, 3)\nApple 1 (A): (1, 1)\nApple 2 (A): (3, 2)\nApple 3 (A): (4, 6)\n\nNow, let's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\nFor the apple at (1,1):\n- From UP move (3,3): |3-1| + |3-1| = 2 + 2 = 4\n- From LEFT move (4,2): |4-1| + |2-1| = 3 + 1 = 4\n- From RIGHT move (4,4): |4-1| + |4-1| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nFor the apple at (3,2):\n- From UP move (3,3): |3-3| + |3-2| = 0 + 1 = 1\n- From LEFT move (4,2): |4-3| + |2-2| = 1 + 0 = 1\n- From RIGHT move (4,4): |4-3| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nFor the apple at (4,6):\n- From UP move (3,3): |3-4| + |3-6| = 1 + 3 = 4\n- From LEFT move (4,2): |4-4| + |2-6| = 0 + 4 = 4\n- From RIGHT move (4,4): |4-4| + |4-6| = 0 + 2 = 2\n\nFrom these results, we can see that:\n- Moving UP gets us a distance of 1 to the apple at (3,2).\n- Moving LEFT also gets us a distance of 1 to the apple at (3,2).\n- Moving RIGHT gets us a distance of 2 to the apple at (4,6).\n\nSo, both UP and LEFT get us at a distance of 1 from the apple at (3,2), which is the closest apple. Given that both options are equivalent in terms of distance, I'll choose UP since the snake is already moving in that direction and it maintains the momentum.\n\nTherefore, my answer is: UP.\n\nOops, one moment. Since we're at (4, 3) and moving UP would put us at (3, 3), which means we'd be right next to the apple at (3, 2), it might be more advantageous to move UP and then LEFT in the next turn, rather than immediately moving LEFT. This gives us more flexibility.\n\nTherefore, my confirmed answer is: UP.\n\nActually, wait. Looking at the board one more time to be sure:\n\n```\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#  H  A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at (4, 3). If we go UP, we'll be at (3, 3), which is adjacent to the apple at (3, 2). This means we can eat that apple in the next move.\n\nIf we go LEFT, we'll be at (4, 2), which is also adjacent to the apple but would require an UP movement in the next turn to eat it.\n\nSo, both options are equivalent in terms of how quickly we can eat the apple at (3, 2). However, going UP seems slightly more favorable as it's already in the direction the snake is moving.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is: UP.Game board:\n```\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#  H  A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nI need to make a decision for the snake's next move. The snake head (H) is currently at position (4,3) and moving UP.\n\nLooking at the board, there are three apples:\n1. One at the top-left (1,1)\n2. One in the middle-left (3,2)\n3. One on the right side of the same row as the snake's head (4,6)\n\nSince the snake is currently moving UP, I can continue UP or turn LEFT or RIGHT (I cannot go DOWN as that would be reversing direction).\n\nIf I move UP, I'll be at (3,3), which is right next to the apple at (3,2). This gives me a great position to eat that apple on my next move.\n\nIf I move LEFT, I'll be at (4,2), which would also put me adjacent to the apple at (3,2), but would require an additional turn.\n\nIf I move RIGHT, I'd be moving toward the apple at (4,6), but it would take multiple moves to reach it.\n\nSince moving UP puts me in position to quickly eat the apple at (3,2) and maintains my current momentum, I'll choose UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Let me analyze the current game situation:\n\nGame board:\n```\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n# AH   #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 2\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is located in the middle of the board, specifically at row 3, column 4 (if we consider 0-based indexing). The current direction is UP.\n\nThe snake's body consists of just the head at this point since there's no 'S' on the board.\n\nThere are 3 apples ('A') on the board:\n1. One at the top left (row 1, column 1)\n2. One to the left of the snake's head (row 3, column 2)\n3. One at the right side of the board (row 4, column 6)\n\nNow I need to decide on a move. Since the snake is currently moving UP, I can choose to keep going UP, or turn LEFT or RIGHT. I cannot choose DOWN as that would be a reversal of direction.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n1. UP: If I move UP, the snake's head will go to position (row 2, column 4). There's nothing there, so it's a safe move but doesn't get me an apple.\n\n2. LEFT: If I move LEFT, the snake's head will go to position (row 3, column 3). There's nothing there immediately, but one more step left would lead to an apple. So this seems strategic for the next move.\n\n3. RIGHT: If I move RIGHT, the snake's head will go to position (row 3, column 5). This is also safe but doesn't get me closer to any apple immediately.\n\nGiven these options, I think moving LEFT is the best strategic choice because it positions the snake to eat an apple in the next move. By moving left, I'll be one step away from the apple at (row 3, column 2).\n\nSo my answer is: LEFTI'll analyze the current game situation:\n\nGame board:\n```\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n# AH   #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 2\n\nLooking at the board, I can see:\n- The snake's head ('H') is in the middle of the 3rd row\n- There's an apple ('A') immediately to the left of the snake's head\n- There are two more apples - one in the top left corner and one in the right side of the 4th row\n- The snake has only its head (no body segments yet)\n- The current direction is UP\n\nSince I want to maximize my score by eating apples, the most logical move is to turn LEFT to eat the apple that's adjacent to the snake's head. This will increase my score by 1 and grow the snake.\n\nMoving UP or RIGHT would not immediately get me an apple, while moving DOWN would be invalid since I can't reverse my current direction.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Let me analyze the current game board:\n\n```\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n# HS   #\n#   A A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (3, 2) (row 3, column 2) and is moving LEFT. The snake's body 'S' is at position (3, 3).\n\nI need to decide on a direction to move. Let's consider the options:\n\n1. LEFT: If I move left, the snake head will be at position (3, 1). This is a valid move and there's no apple there.\n\n2. RIGHT: This would be a 180-degree turn from LEFT, which is not allowed according to the rules. The snake cannot reverse its direction directly.\n\n3. UP: If I move up, the snake head will be at position (2, 2). This is a valid move and there's no apple there.\n\n4. DOWN: If I move down, the snake head will be at position (4, 2). This is a valid move and there's no apple there.\n\nNow, I need to consider the best strategy. The goal is to eat apples to increase the score. There are three apples on the board:\n- One apple 'A' at position (1, 1)\n- One apple 'A' at position (4, 4)\n- One apple 'A' at position (4, 6)\n\nIf I want to aim for an apple, I need to plan the shortest path:\n\n- For the apple at (1, 1), from (3, 2), I need to go UP twice and then LEFT once.\n- For the apple at (4, 4), from (3, 2), I need to go DOWN once and then RIGHT twice.\n- For the apple at (4, 6), from (3, 2), I need to go DOWN once and then RIGHT four times.\n\nThe closest apple seems to be at (1, 1), which requires 3 moves. Let's aim for that one. The first step is to go UP.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check by plotting the exact positions on a coordinate system to ensure I'm making the correct move.\n\nThe board is 8x8, with indices 0-7. Let's label the positions:\n\n```\n(0,0)(0,1)(0,2)(0,3)(0,4)(0,5)(0,6)(0,7)\n(1,0)(1,1)(1,2)(1,3)(1,4)(1,5)(1,6)(1,7)\n(2,0)(2,1)(2,2)(2,3)(2,4)(2,5)(2,6)(2,7)\n(3,0)(3,1)(3,2)(3,3)(3,4)(3,5)(3,6)(3,7)\n(4,0)(4,1)(4,2)(4,3)(4,4)(4,5)(4,6)(4,7)\n(5,0)(5,1)(5,2)(5,3)(5,4)(5,5)(5,6)(5,7)\n(6,0)(6,1)(6,2)(6,3)(6,4)(6,5)(6,6)(6,7)\n(7,0)(7,1)(7,2)(7,3)(7,4)(7,5)(7,6)(7,7)\n```\n\nWait, I need to be careful with the row and column indexing, since the board is represented as a list of strings.\n\nLet's do this again. The board is:\n\n```\n########  (row 0)\n#A     #  (row 1)\n#      #  (row 2)\n# HS   #  (row 3)\n#   A A#  (row 4)\n#      #  (row 5)\n#      #  (row 6)\n########  (row 7)\n```\n\nSo, the snake head 'H' is at row 3, column 2, and the snake body 'S' is at row 3, column 3.\n\nThe apples 'A' are at:\n- Row 1, column 1\n- Row 4, column 4\n- Row 4, column 6\n\nNow, let's reconsider the directions:\n\n1. UP: Move to (2, 2). This is a valid move and gets us closer to the apple at (1, 1).\n2. DOWN: Move to (4, 2). This is a valid move and gets us closer to the apples at (4, 4) and (4, 6).\n3. LEFT: Move to (3, 1). This is a valid move but doesn't get us directly closer to any apple.\n4. RIGHT: This is not a valid move because it would be a 180-degree turn from the current LEFT direction.\n\nLet's reconsider the paths to each apple:\n\n- For the apple at (1, 1), from (3, 2), I need to go UP twice and then LEFT once.\n- For the apple at (4, 4), from (3, 2), I need to go DOWN once and then RIGHT twice. But I can't turn RIGHT directly from LEFT, I'd need to go UP or DOWN first.\n- For the apple at (4, 6), from (3, 2), I need to go DOWN once and then RIGHT four times, with the same turning constraint.\n\nSo, for the closest available path to an apple, let's move UP, which gets us closer to the apple at (1, 1).\n\nActually, wait, I think there's a miscommunication. In the problem, the board is said to be 8x8, but '#' actually indicates the walls around the edges. So the actual playable area is 6x6.\n\nLet's redo my analysis with that in mind:\n\n```\n########  (row 0, all are walls)\n#A     #  (row 1, walls at col 0 and 7, apple at col 1)\n#      #  (row 2, walls at col 0 and 7)\n# HS   #  (row 3, walls at col 0 and 7, head at col 2, body at col 3)\n#   A A#  (row 4, walls at col 0 and 7, apples at col 4 and 6)\n#      #  (row 5, walls at col 0 and 7)\n#      #  (row 6, walls at col 0 and 7)\n########  (row 7, all are walls)\n```\n\nThe snake head is at row 3, column 2, and the body is at row 3, column 3. The snake is moving LEFT.\n\nLet's reevaluate the possible moves:\n\n1. LEFT: Move to (3, 1). This is a valid move, and there's no apple there.\n2. UP: Move to (2, 2). This is a valid move, and there's no apple there.\n3. DOWN: Move to (4, 2). This is a valid move, and there's no apple there.\n4. RIGHT: Not a valid move due to the 180-degree turn constraint.\n\nThe apples are at:\n- Row 1, column 1\n- Row 4, column 4\n- Row 4, column 6\n\nTo reach the apple at (1, 1) from (3, 2), I'd need to move UP twice and then LEFT once.\nTo reach the apple at (4, 4) from (3, 2), I'd need to move DOWN once, then get to a position from which I can turn RIGHT.\nTo reach the apple at (4, 6) from (3, 2), the process is similar to the one for (4, 4).\n\nActually, it seems like the best move is still to go UP, aiming for the apple at (1, 1). By moving UP, I'll also have more options in the next moves to potentially approach other apples.\n\nSo, my answer is UP.\n\nLet's double-check:\nCurrent position of the head: (3, 2)\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nIf I move UP, the new position of the head will be (2, 2).\n\nThere's nothing at (2, 2), so it's a valid move. The head will move to (2, 2), and the body segment will move to where the head was, at (3, 2).\n\nYes, my answer is UP.\n\nActually, I want to make sure I'm interpreting the board orientation correctly. Let me verify:\n```\n########  (top row, row 0, all are walls)\n#A     #  (row 1, walls at col 0 and 7, apple at col 1)\n#      #  (row 2, walls at col 0 and 7)\n# HS   #  (row 3, walls at col 0 and 7, head at col 2, body at col 3)\n#   A A#  (row 4, walls at col 0 and 7, apples at col 4 and 6)\n#      #  (row 5, walls at col 0 and 7)\n#      #  (row 6, walls at col 0 and 7)\n########  (bottom row, row 7, all are walls)\n```\n\nIn this orientation, UP would move the snake's head from (3, 2) to (2, 2).\nLEFT would move the snake's head from (3, 2) to (3, 1).\n\nBased on the description, the snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head) and it only grows when it eats an apple. Since there's already a body segment (which would make the length 2), I'm inferring that the snake has already eaten an apple at some point. This is also consistent with the fact that the current epoch is 3; the snake must have moved at least a couple of times.\n\nAlright, given the current position of the snake, the direction it's moving, and the positions of the apples, my decision is to move UP to aim for the apple at (1, 1).\n\nLet's make my answer crystal clear:\nThe current board looks like:\n```\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n# HS   #\n#   A A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head is at position (3, 2) and is currently moving LEFT.\nAvailable moves are LEFT, UP, and DOWN.\n\nI choose to move UP, so the snake's head will be at position (2, 2) after the move.\n\nMy final answer is: UP.Game board:\n```\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n# HS   #\n#   A A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nLooking at the current game board, I need to decide the best move for the snake. Here's my analysis:\n\nThe snake's head (H) is currently at row 3, column 2, and is moving LEFT. The snake has one body segment (S) at row 3, column 3.\n\nThere are three apples on the board:\n- One at the top left (row 1, column 1)\n- Two on row 4 (at columns 4 and 6)\n\nMy options are:\n- Continue moving LEFT (toward the wall, but still safe for one move)\n- Move UP (toward the top apple)\n- Move DOWN (toward the bottom apples)\n\nSince I can't move RIGHT (that would be a 180-degree turn from LEFT direction), I need to choose from the other three directions.\n\nI'll choose to move UP as this will start positioning me toward the apple in the top left corner, which is reachable in a few moves. This also gives me flexibility to change direction in future turns.\n\nAnswer: UP","Let's understand the game state:\n\n1. The board is 8x8, with walls ('#') around the edges.\n2. The snake's head ('H') is at the third row from the top, second column from the left.\n3. The snake's body ('S') is below the head, at the fourth row, second column.\n4. There are three apples ('A') on the board: one at the top left, and two at the bottom right.\n5. The current direction is UP.\n\nHere's the current board:\n```\n########\n#A     #\n# H    #\n# S    #\n#   A A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nSince the snake is currently moving UP, the possible directions I can choose are: UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. I cannot choose DOWN because the snake cannot reverse its direction directly.\n\nLet's analyze each possible direction:\n\n1. If I go UP: The snake's head will move to the position at row 1, column 2. This is a valid move, and the snake will collide with the apple at the top left. This will increase the score by 1.\n\n2. If I go LEFT: The snake's head will move to the position at row 2, column 1. This is a valid move, and the snake will collide with the wall.\n\n3. If I go RIGHT: The snake's head will move to the position at row 2, column 3. This is a valid move, but there is no apple there. It's just an empty space.\n\nLet's check more carefully. The apple is at the top-left, which is row 1, column 1 (or #A    ). If I go UP, the head will move from its current position (row 2, column 2) to row 1, column 2. This won't hit the apple. If I go LEFT, the head will move to row 2, column 1, and then if I go UP after that, I could get to the apple.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to hit the walls. If I go LEFT, the snake's head will move to the position at row 2, column 1. But column 1 is the wall, so I can't go LEFT.\n\nLet me re-read the board:\n```\n########\n#A     #\n# H    #\n# S    #\n#   A A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nOk, column 0 is the wall. Column 1 is where the apple is at the top. Column 2 is where the snake's head and body are. If I go LEFT, the snake's head will move to row 2, column 1. There's no wall there, so it's a valid move. But it doesn't lead directly to an apple. If I go UP after that, the head will move to row 1, column 1, where there's an apple. But that's the next move. I only need to decide the direction for this move now, not for the next one.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, there's no apple in the immediate vicinity. But it opens up the board and gives me more space to maneuver.\n\nIf I go UP, I'm going further up and might get closer to the apple at the top, but it also limits my movement in the next few steps, as I can only go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nI said the snake would move to \"row 1, column 1\" which is actually just a wall. Let's clarify.\n\nFrom the board, I can see:\n- Row 0, columns 0-7: All walls\n- Row 1, column 1: An apple\n- Row 2, column 2: The snake's head\n- Row 3, column 2: The snake's body\n- Row 4, columns 4-5: Two apples\n- Row 7, columns 0-7: All walls\n\nSo, if I go UP, the snake's head will move to position (row 1, column 2), which doesn't have an apple. If I go LEFT, the snake's head will move to position (row 2, column 1), which also doesn't have an apple, but it's closer to the apple at position (row 1, column 1).\n\nAt this moment, going LEFT seems like the best strategy because it positions me closer to one of the apples. Let's go for LEFT.\n\nHowever, let's double check one more time:\n\nGame board:\n```\n########\n#A     #\n# H    #\n# S    #\n#   A A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nLet's clarify a bit more: \n- Row 0, columns 0-7: All walls (the top edge of the board)\n- Row 1, column 1: An apple ('A')\n- Row 2, column 2: The snake's head ('H')\n- Row 3, column 2: The snake's body ('S')\n- Row 4, columns 4-5: Two apples ('A')\n- Row 7, columns 0-7: All walls (the bottom edge of the board)\n\nLet's check the decision again:\n\n1. UP: The snake's head moves to position (row 1, column 2). This doesn't have an apple and may limit my movement.\n\n2. LEFT: The snake's head moves to position (row 2, column 1). This also doesn't have an apple, but it gets me closer to the apple at position (row 1, column 1).\n\n3. RIGHT: The snake's head moves to position (row 2, column 3). This doesn't have an apple, and it moves me away from the nearest apple.\n\nActually one problem with going LEFT is that it puts me next to a wall, which can be dangerous. If I go UP, though, I can still go LEFT in the next move to get to the apple, and I have more space. Let's think about this differently, try to plan out two moves.\n\nIf I go LEFT now, then my next valid move could be UP, which would lead to the apple at the top. But if I go UP now, then my next valid move could also be LEFT, which would also lead to the apple at the top.\n\nEither way could lead to the apple, but going UP gives me more options for future moves.\n\nLet me think once more: the current direction is UP, which means the snake is already moving upwards, and the head is at (row 2, column 2). If I continue to move UP, the head will move to (row 1, column 2), which doesn't have an apple.\n\nAlternatively, I can turn LEFT, in which case the head will move to (row 2, column 1). This position is adjacent to the apple at (row 1, column 1), which I can reach in the next move by going UP.\n\nOK, but similarly, if I continue to move UP now, the head will move to (row 1, column 2), and then I can move LEFT in the next move to reach the apple at (row 1, column 1).\n\nActually, on second thought, if I go LEFT now, I run the risk of colliding with the wall, because the walls are at column 0. Let me double check where the walls are for this board.\n\nOK, looking at the board again:\n```\n########\n#A     #\n# H    #\n# S    #\n#   A A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nThe '#' are walls, they surround the edges of the board. So, the leftmost column inside the board is column 1 (counting from 0), not column 0. And the topmost row inside the board is row 1.\n\nSo, if I go LEFT, the snake's head will move to position (row 2, column 1), which is not a wall. And if I go UP, the head will move to position (row 1, column 2), which is also not a wall.\n\nIn that case, going LEFT seems like a better strategy because it positions me closer to the apple at position (row 1, column 1).\n\nActually, let's clarify once more. In the ASCII representation, the '#' are walls.\n- Position (0, 0) is a wall (top-left corner).\n- Position (1, 1) is where the apple is (the \"A\" in the second row, second column).\n- Position (2, 2) is where the snake's head is (the \"H\" in the third row, third column).\n- Position (3, 2) is where the snake's body is (the \"S\" in the fourth row, third column).\n\nHere's the board with the positions marked:\n```\n   01234567\n  0########\n  1#A     #\n  2# H    #\n  3# S    #\n  4#   A A#\n  5#      #\n  6#      #\n  7########\n```\n\nSo, if I go LEFT, the snake's head will move from position (2, 2) to position (2, 1), which is not a wall. And if I go UP, the head will move to position (1, 2), which is also not a wall.\n\nActually, I think I got confused by trying to start the grid from (0, 0). Let's label the board like this instead:\n\n```\n   01234567\n  0########\n  1#A     #\n  2# H    #\n  3# S    #\n  4#   A A#\n  5#      #\n  6#      #\n  7########\n```\n\nSo:\n- The top wall is at row 0, the bottom wall is at row 7.\n- The left wall is at column 0, the right wall is at column 7.\n- The apple is at position (1, 1).\n- The snake's head is at position (2, 2).\n- The snake's body is at position (3, 2).\n\nWith this labeling, if I go LEFT, the snake's head will move to position (2, 1), which is one position to the left of the head, immediately next to the apple at position (1, 1). If I go UP after that, I will reach the apple.\n\nAlternatively, if I go UP now, the head will move to position (1, 2), which is one row above the head. From there, I can move LEFT to reach the apple.\n\nSo both strategies would allow me to reach the apple in two moves. But by going LEFT now, I'm positioning myself more directly in line with the apple, which may be a better strategy for future movements. Also, if I go UP now, I might need to make more turns to reach the other apples.\n\nLet's think about the longer-term strategy:\nThere are two more apples at the bottom of the board, at positions (4, 4) and (4, 5). If I go LEFT now and then UP to get the apple at (1, 1), I'll end up with the head at (1, 1). From there, I'll need to navigate to the bottom of the board for the other apples.\n\nIf I go UP now and then LEFT to get the apple at (1, 1), I'll end up with the head at (1, 1) as well. So, in terms of the next apple, both strategies are equivalent.\n\nThere's a slight nuance: if I go LEFT now, and another apple appears somewhere else, I'll be able to react to it more easily because I'll have more open space around me. If I go UP now, I'll be closer to the top wall, which limits my movement options in the next few steps.\n\nGiven these considerations, I'll choose to go LEFT, which positions me for a direct approach to the apple and keeps my options more open for future movements. Left will lead me to position (2, 1), which is adjacent to the apple, and I can reach it by going UP in the next move.\n\nSo my decision is to go LEFT.\n\nBut wait, another thing I need to keep in mind: The game says \"The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board\", which means new apples won't be appearing after I eat them. There are 3 apples on the board now.\n\nIn this light:\n1. The apple at (1, 1) is the closest.\n2. The other two apples are at (4, 4) and (4, 5).\n\nSo the priority is to eat the apple at (1, 1) first, and then navigate to the other two. With that in mind, I'll go LEFT to approach the closest apple.\n\nWait, let's double check this one more time (I got confused earlier):\n\nThe board:\n```\n########\n#A     #\n# H    #\n# S    #\n#   A A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\n- The snake's head ('H') is at position (2, 2).\n- There's an apple at position (1, 1).\n- If I go LEFT, the head will move to position (2, 1).\n- If I go UP, the head will move to position (1, 2).\n\nBy going LEFT, I'm positioning the head at (2, 1), which is just below the apple at (1, 1).\n\nBy going UP, I'm positioning the head at (1, 2), which is just to the right of the apple at (1, 1).\n\nBoth moves position me adjacent to the apple, but in different positions.\n\nActually, there's one more nuance to consider. After the next move, the snake's tail will move to the position where the head was before the move. This is because, unless the snake eats an apple, it moves its entire body forward by one position. If the snake eats an apple, its body grows by one.\n\nGiven that, if I go LEFT, the snake will have its head at (2, 1) and its body at (2, 2) after the move. In other words, the head will move left, and the tail will move up.\n\nIf I go UP, the snake will have its head at (1, 2) and its body at (2, 2) after the move. To clarify, the head will move up, but the tail will not move (it is at the same row and column as before). This is confusing, because I said the \"tail will move to the position where the head was\", but that would put the head and tail on the same spot, which can't be right.\n\nOK, re-reading the problem. The snake's body is represented by 'S'. In the current state, the snake has a head at (2, 2) and a body segment at (3, 2). The snake's length is 2 (the head and one body segment).\n\nIf the snake moves without eating an apple, the head will move to the new position, and the body segment will move to the position where the head was previously. The end of the body segment will disappear.\n\nIf the snake eats an apple, the head will move to the new position (where the apple is), and the body will follow by adding a new body segment to the head's previous position. The end of the body does not disappear. This is how the snake grows in length.\n\nSo:\n- If I go LEFT, the snake will have its head at (2, 1) and its body segment at (2, 2). The snake won't eat an apple, so the body segment at (3, 2) will disappear.\n- If I go UP, the snake will have its head at (1, 2) and its body segment at (2, 2). Again, the snake won't eat an apple, so the body segment at (3, 2) will disappear.\n\nIn the next move (after the one I'm deciding now):\n- If I went LEFT, then going UP will move the head to (1, 1), where there's an apple. The body will be at (2, 1) and (2, 2) after eating the apple.\n- If I went UP, then going LEFT will move the head to (1, 1), where there's an apple. The body will be at (1, 2) and (2, 2) after eating the apple.\n\nActually wait, I might still be misunderstanding the problem. The problem specifies \"The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head)\". But in the current game board, there's a head ('H') and a body segment ('S'). This suggests that the snake has already grown from its initial length. For this to have happened, the snake must have eaten an apple already. Actually the problem also specifies \"Each time the snake eats an apple [...] the snake grows in length\". So the Snake doesn't start with a body, and the body only gets added when eating an apple.\n\nLet's re-analyze:\n1. The snake's head is at (2, 2).\n2. The snake has a body segment at (3, 2). This means the snake has eaten an apple already. (Actually, this makes sense because we're in epoch 4, not epoch 1).\n3. If the snake moves without eating an apple, the head will move to the new position, and the body segment will follow. It'll replace the position where the head was, and move each body segment accordingly.\n4. If the snake eats an apple, the head will move to the new position (where the apple is), and a new body segment will be added to the head's previous position. The existing body segments will still follow the head.\n\nGiven these clarifications:\n- If I go LEFT, the snake will have its head at (2, 1) and its body segment at (2, 2). In the next move, if I go UP, the head will move to (1, 1) (where the apple is), and the body will be at (2, 1) and (2, 2).\n- If I go UP, the snake will have its head at (1, 2) and its body segment at (2, 2). In the next move, if I go LEFT, the head will move to (1, 1) (where the apple is), and the body will be at (1, 2) and (2, 2).\n\nBoth strategies lead to the apple in two moves, and the snake will have the same length after eating the apple. The only difference is the positions of the body segments. From a strategic perspective, considering the location of the other apples at (4, 4) and (4, 5), it's probably more efficient to have the body segments positioned in a way that makes it easier to navigate to the other apples.\n\nActually, since the other apples are at the bottom-right, it's probably more efficient to go UP now, which will position the body at the top, making it easier to move down to get to the other apples without having the body in the way. (Actually, I should have been more precise: it's more efficient to go UP now because that positions the body in a away that interferes less when trying to navigate to the other apples later. That is, it leaves the body at the top, which leaves the path to the bottom apples more open). This avoids the danger of the snake getting entangled with its own body when trying to navigate to the other apples.\n\nSo, I'll choose UP.\n\nWait, I read that after the Snake eats an apple, it grows by appending to the end of the snake, not by adding a segment between the head and the first body segment. If so, the segment will be extended from the end of the snake, not the middle.\n\nThis casts a bit of doubt on my reasoning, because it means after eating the apple the snake's body will like (Head)-(Body1)-(Body2), not (Head)-(New body)-(Body1). If so, the original reason for favoring UP ( to leave the body at the top, which leaves the path to the bottom apples more open) is not valid, as the path to the bottom apples will be obstructed in both cases.\n\nLet me carefully think through the behavior of the game.\n\nStarting from the initial game board, the snake is (H) at (2, 2) with a body segment (S) at (3, 2).\n\nIf I go UP, the head will move to (1, 2), and the body segment (which is \"trailing\") will move to (2, 2). That is, the new configuration will be (H) at (1, 2), and (S) at (2, 2).\n\nIf I go LEFT, the head will move to (2, 1), and the body segment (which is \"trailing\") will move to (2, 2). That is, the new configuration will be (H) at (2, 1), and (S) at (2, 2).\n\nNeither of these moves will eat an apple, so the snake doesn't grow in length.\n\nLet's see what happens in the next move:\n\nIf I had gone UP and then go LEFT, the head will move to (1, 1) (where there's an apple), the body segment will move to (1, 2), and the snake will eat the apple.\n\nFollowing our understanding that the snake grows by \"growing at the tail\", (and not by adding a new segment between the head and the first body segment), the positions would be:\n- (1, 1): Head\n- (1, 2): Body (first segment)\n- (2, 2): Body (new segment)\n\n(Actually, I think I understand snake now... the snake grows by adding a body segment where the head was, and the existing body segments remain in place. For instance, if the snake had 3 body segments at positions (3, 3), (3, 4), and (3, 5), and the head was at position (3, 2) right before an apple was eaten, then after the apple is eaten, the body segments are at (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), and (3, 5). So the snake grows in the front, not the end.)\n\nSo maybe I just go LEFT, and then UP to get to the apple, my snake will be:\n- (1, 1): Head\n- (2, 1): Body (first segment)\n- (2, 2): Body (second segment)\n\nAnd if I go UP, and then LEFT, my snake will be:\n- (1, 1): Head\n- (1, 2): Body (first segment)\n- (2, 2): Body (second segment)\n\nThese are different positions for the body, post-eating the apple. Which is more favorable for navigating to the other apples at (4, 4) and (4, 5)?\n\nIf the snake were at (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), and I want to go to the bottom-right, I'd want to follow a path like: RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN, RIGHT, RIGHT, (to reach the apple at (4, 4)) and then RIGHT (to reach the apple at (4, 5)). But notice that the body segments are at (2, 1) and (2, 2), which are in the way when I want to get to the bottom right. I think I would face difficulties, as by the time I reach say (3, 4), my tail would be at (2, 3) and (2, 2), which might block off paths.\n\nAlternatively, if the snake were at (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), and I want to go to the bottom-right, I could go: RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN, RIGHT, RIGHT. The body would be at (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2) at the start, and as I move, it would adjust. By the time I reach (3, 4), the body would be at (3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2), which is less likely to block off paths. This is the pathway if I go UP now.\n\nOK on second thought, going UP and then LEFT (to get the top-left apple) is a superior strategy because the body segments are positioned more favorably for navigating to the other apples afterward.\n\nTherefore, my choice is to go UP.## Game Board\n```\n########\n#A     #\n# H    #\n# S    #\n#   A A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\n## Analysis\n\nI need to decide which direction to move the snake next. Currently, the snake's head is at position (2,2) and the snake is moving upward.\n\nLet's consider my options:\n1. UP: The snake will move to position (1,2), which is an empty space.\n2. LEFT: The snake will move to position (2,1), which is an empty space.\n3. RIGHT: The snake will move to position (2,3), which is an empty space.\n4. DOWN: I cannot choose this as it would reverse the current direction.\n\nI notice there's an apple at position (1,1) which is the closest apple. To reach that apple, I can:\n- Go UP now, then LEFT in the next move\n- Go LEFT now, then UP in the next move\n\nBoth options would get me to the apple in two moves. However, going UP first positions my snake's body in a way that will make it easier to navigate toward the other apples at the bottom of the board after eating the first apple.\n\nBy going UP, the snake's body will trail along the top of the board, keeping the center and bottom areas clear for future movement toward the apples at positions (4,4) and (4,5).\n\nTherefore, I'll move UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","I'll start by understanding the current game state:\n\n1. The game board is 8x8 with walls (#) on the edges.\n2. The snake's head (H) is at the 2nd row, 3rd column.\n3. There's a part of the snake's body (S) at the 3rd row, 3rd column.\n4. There are three apples (A) on the board:\n   - One at the 2nd row, 1st column\n   - One at the 5th row, 4th column\n   - One at the 5th row, 6th column\n5. The snake is currently moving UP.\n6. We're at epoch 5 of 100.\n\nNow I need to determine the best move for the snake. The snake cannot reverse direction, so it cannot move DOWN (which would be the opposite of UP). The viable options are LEFT, RIGHT, and continue moving UP.\n\nLet me analyze each option:\n\n1. UP: If the snake moves UP, it will hit the wall (#) and lose the game. So this is not a good move.\n\n2. LEFT: If the snake moves LEFT, it will eat an apple (A) and grow in length. This seems like a good move since it increases the score.\n\n3. RIGHT: If the snake moves RIGHT, it will move into an empty space. This is a safe move but doesn't increase the score.\n\nGiven these options, the best move would be LEFT since it allows the snake to eat an apple and increase its score without risking a collision.\n\nSo my answer is LEFT.Game board:\n\n########\n#AH    #\n# S    #\n#      #\n#   A A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nI need to determine the best move based on the current state:\n- Snake head (H) is at row 2, column 3\n- Snake body (S) is at row 3, column 2\n- Snake is currently moving UP\n- There's an apple (A) immediately to the left of the head\n- Two more apples are in row 5\n\nAnalysis:\n- Moving UP would make the snake hit the wall, ending the game\n- Moving DOWN would reverse direction, which is not allowed\n- Moving RIGHT would just move into empty space\n- Moving LEFT would let the snake eat an apple and increase score\n\nThe best option is to move LEFT to eat the apple and grow the snake.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Let me analyze the game board:\n\n```\n########\n#HS    #\n# S    #\n#      #\n#   AAA#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at the top left corner. The snake has a body 'S' segment to the right of the head, and another 'S' segment below the first 'S'. The current direction is LEFT, which means the snake is currently moving left.\n\nThe snake cannot reverse its direction, so I cannot choose RIGHT as the next direction (since the snake is currently moving LEFT).\n\nLooking at the possible moves:\n- LEFT: This would cause the snake to hit the wall (#) on the left, resulting in game over.\n- UP: This would cause the snake to hit the wall (#) on the top, resulting in game over.\n- DOWN: This would allow the snake to move down safely.\n\nSo, the best move appears to be DOWN.\n\nThe remaining game objects are three apples ('A') at coordinates (4, 4), (5, 4), and (6, 4), which are out of immediate reach for the snake.\n\nI'll choose DOWN as the next direction for the snake.Game board:\n```\n########\n#HS    #\n# S    #\n#      #\n#   AAA#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nLooking at the game board, I need to decide the best move for the snake. The snake's head (H) is currently at the top-left corner of the board, and it's moving LEFT according to the current direction.\n\nI need to consider my options:\n- LEFT would cause the snake to hit the left wall (#), resulting in a game over\n- UP would cause the snake to hit the top wall (#), resulting in a game over\n- RIGHT would be an illegal move since the snake cannot reverse its direction from LEFT\n- DOWN is the only safe move available\n\nBy moving DOWN, the snake will move safely into an empty space, avoiding collision with walls or itself. This will also orient the snake toward the apples that are located at the middle-right area of the board.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Let's analyze the game board and current state:\n\n```\n########\n#SS    #\n#H     #\n#      #\n#   AAA#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nThe snake has a head 'H' at position (2, 1) (row 2, column 1, 0-indexed) and two body segments 'S' at positions (1, 1) and (1, 2).\n\nThe current direction is DOWN, which means the snake is moving from top to bottom.\n\nThere are three apples 'A' at positions (4, 4), (4, 5), and (4, 6).\n\nNow, let's consider the possible moves:\n1. LEFT: The snake would move to position (2, 0), which is a wall '#'. This would result in a collision and game over.\n2. RIGHT: The snake would move to position (2, 2), which is an empty space. This is a valid move.\n3. UP: Since the current direction is DOWN, the snake cannot move UP (it can't reverse direction).\n4. DOWN: The snake would move to position (3, 1), which is an empty space. This is a valid move.\n\nGiven these options, I can move either RIGHT or DOWN. Let's think about the strategy:\n\nIf I move RIGHT, the snake will be heading toward the center of the board, and eventually, I can navigate it toward the apples on the right side of the board.\n\nIf I move DOWN, the snake will continue in its current direction, and then I'd need to make a right turn to reach the apples.\n\nI think moving RIGHT is a better strategic choice because it will help us get closer to the apples more efficiently. After moving RIGHT, the snake's head will be at position (2, 2) and the body segments will be at positions (2, 1) and (1, 1).\n\nSo, my chosen direction is RIGHT.Game board:\n```\n########\n#SS    #\n#H     #\n#      #\n#   AAA#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nI need to decide my next move based on the current state of the game.\n\nCurrent position:\n- Snake head (H) is at row 2, column 1\n- Snake body segments (S) are at row 1, columns 1 and 2\n- Current direction is DOWN\n- Three apples (A) are in row 4, columns 4, 5, and 6\n\nPossible moves:\n- LEFT: Would hit the wall (not valid)\n- RIGHT: Would move to an empty space\n- DOWN: Would continue in current direction to an empty space\n- UP: Can't reverse direction from DOWN to UP (not valid)\n\nStrategic analysis:\nMoving RIGHT makes the most sense as it will turn the snake toward the center of the board, allowing me to eventually reach the apples on the right side. Moving DOWN would take me further from the apples, requiring more turns later.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","I'm given a Snake game board and I need to determine the best move for the snake.\n\nLet's break down the current state:\n- Board size: 8x8\n- Snake head (H) is at position (2, 3) (row 3, column 3)\n- Snake body (S) is at positions (2, 2) and (1, 2) (row 3, column 2 and row 2, column 2)\n- Apples (A) are at positions (4, 4), (4, 5), and (4, 6) (row 5, columns 4, 5, and 6)\n- The snake is currently moving to the RIGHT\n\nThe goal is to eat as many apples as possible without colliding with walls or the snake's own body.\n\nLet's check the valid moves:\n1. UP: Moving up would make the snake's head go to position (1, 3). This position is empty, so this move is valid.\n2. RIGHT: Moving right would make the snake's head go to position (2, 4). This position is empty, so this move is valid.\n3. DOWN: Moving down would make the snake's head go to position (3, 3). This position is empty, so this move is valid.\n4. LEFT: Moving left would make the snake's head go to position (2, 2). This position has a segment of the snake's body (S), so this move is not valid and would result in a collision.\n\nSo, the valid moves are UP, RIGHT, and DOWN.\n\nNow, I need to decide which of these valid moves is the best to eat apples. The apples are at (4, 4), (4, 5), and (4, 6), which are all below and to the right of the snake's head.\n\nLet's calculate the distances from the snake's head to each apple:\n- Distance to apple at (4, 4): |2 - 4| + |3 - 4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n- Distance to apple at (4, 5): |2 - 4| + |3 - 5| = 2 + 2 = 4\n- Distance to apple at (4, 6): |2 - 4| + |3 - 6| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nThe closest apple is at (4, 4).\n\nTo reach this apple, the snake needs to move DOWN and then RIGHT. Since the snake is currently moving RIGHT, moving DOWN is a direct turn and is valid.\n\nLet's verify this is the best move by checking how the directions get us to the other apples:\n- RIGHT: Gets closer to apples, but still not as close as going DOWN first.\n- UP: Moves away from the apples.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN, which will bring the snake closer to the nearest apple.\n\nAlright, my answer is DOWN.\n\nLet me just verify one more time:\n- Given the current board and the snake moving RIGHT, turning DOWN is a valid move.\n- Moving DOWN will bring the snake closer to the nearest apple.\n- There are no immediate obstacles in the DOWN direction.\n\nSo, the answer is:\nDirection: DOWNGame board:\n########\n#S     #\n#SH    #\n#      #\n#   AAA#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the current game board, I can see that the snake's head (H) is moving RIGHT. The snake has two body segments (S) behind it. There are three apples (A) located on the 5th row.\n\nThe snake currently has the following options:\n1. Continue moving RIGHT - This will take the snake horizontally toward the right side of the board\n2. Turn DOWN - This will move the snake toward the apples\n3. Turn UP - This will move the snake toward the top of the board\n\nSince the goal is to eat apples, and there are three apples located below the snake's current position, the best move would be to turn DOWN. This will put the snake on a direct path toward the closest apple.\n\nThe snake cannot move LEFT as that would cause it to collide with its own body.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","HTTPError 529: {\"error\":{\"message\":\"-4316: Overloaded\",\"code\":\"-4307\"}}"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Since the snake is moving upward, it can go left, right, or continue upward. It cannot go down as that would be reversing its direction.\n\nIf the snake moves up, it will move to position (3, 3). There's no apple there, but it's a valid move.\nIf the snake moves left, it will move to position (4, 2). There's no apple there, but it's a valid move.\nIf the snake moves right, it will move to position (4, 4). There's no apple there, but it's a valid move.\n\nLet's think strategically. Since there are apples at (1, 2), (2, 1), and (5, 6), and the snake is currently at (4, 3), the closest apple is at (2, 1). To move towards this apple, the snake should go up and then left.\n\nSo, the best move would be to go UP. This will bring the snake one step closer to the apple at (2, 1).\n\nBut wait, let's double-check:\n- UP: Move to (3, 3), which is one step closer to the apple at (1, 2).\n- LEFT: Move to (4, 2), which is one step closer to the apple at (2, 1).\n- RIGHT: Move to (4, 4), which makes the snake farther from both apples.\n\nActually, I think moving LEFT is a better option if we want to go for the apple at (2, 1). But I see there's also an apple at (1, 2). Hmm, let's analyze more carefully.\n\nFrom snake's head at (4, 3):\n- Apple at (1, 2) is 4 steps away (3 up and 1 left).\n- Apple at (2, 1) is 4 steps away (2 up and 2 left).\n- Apple at (5, 6) is 4 steps away (1 down and 3 right).\n\nIf we go UP, we're one step closer to the apples at (1, 2) and (2, 1).\nIf we go LEFT, we're one step closer to the apples at (1, 2) and (2, 1), but in a different way.\nIf we go RIGHT, we're one step closer to the apple at (5, 6).\n\nI think the best move is UP, as it brings the snake closer to two apples at (1, 2) and (2, 1).\n\nActually, I'm going to review the positions of the apples again to make sure:\n\n```\n########\n# A    #  <- Row 1, Column 2 has an apple\n#A     #  <- Row 2, Column 1 has an apple\n#      #\n#  H   #  <- Snake's head is at Row 4, Column 3\n#     A#  <- Row 5, Column 6 has an apple\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nSo the closest apple from the snake's head is at (2, 1), which is 4 steps away (2 up and 2 left). And if the snake moves UP, it'll be 3 steps away from this apple (1 up and 2 left).\n\nSo, my answer is to move UP.\n\n(Note that (1, 2) refers to the position at row 1, column 2, counting from 0.)I'll first repeat the current game board:\n\n```\n########\n# A    #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nLooking at the game board, I can see the snake's head (H) is in the middle of the board with no body segments yet. There are three apples (A) - one near the top-left, one at the far left in the third row, and one in the bottom-right area.\n\nSince the current direction is UP and I can't reverse direction (can't go DOWN), my options are to continue going UP or turn LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nThe most strategic move would be to continue moving UP toward the apples in the upper part of the board. This will get me closer to two apples rather than just one.\n\nIf I go UP, the snake will move one square upward, getting closer to the apples in the top portion of the board. This is the most direct path to food.\n\nAnswer: UP","Let me analyze the game board and the current state:\n\n```\n########\n# A    #\n#A     #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head (H) is located at position (3, 3) (if we start counting from 0 at the top-left corner). The current direction is UP, which means the snake is moving upward.\n\nHere are my options for the next move:\n1. Continue moving UP\n2. Turn LEFT\n3. Turn RIGHT\n\nSince the snake can't reverse its direction directly, I can't move DOWN.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n1. Moving UP: The snake's head would move to position (3, 2). Looking at the board, that position contains an apple (A), so the snake would eat it and grow in length.\n\n2. Moving LEFT: The snake's head would move to position (2, 3). That position is empty.\n\n3. Moving RIGHT: The snake's head would move to position (4, 3). That position is empty.\n\nGiven that I want to eat as many apples as possible to increase my score, moving UP is the best choice since it will allow the snake to eat an apple immediately.\n\nSo my answer is UP.\n\nLet me double-check:\n- Current position of the head: (3, 3)\n- Current direction: UP\n- If I continue moving UP, the snake's head will move to (3, 2), which contains an apple (A)\n- After eating the apple, the snake will grow in length, and a new apple will be placed randomly on the board (although that's not explicitly mentioned in the rules)\n\nYes, moving UP is the best choice.Game board:\n```\n########\n# A    #\n#A     #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nLooking at the game board, I can see the snake's head (H) is in the middle of the third row. The current direction is UP, so the snake is moving upward.\n\nMy options are to continue moving UP or to turn LEFT or RIGHT (I cannot reverse direction to DOWN).\n\nIf I move UP, I will reach a position where there's an apple (A). This is the best move because:\n1. I'll eat an apple and increase my score by 1\n2. The snake will grow in length\n3. I'll get closer to the other apple in the top-left area\n\nThe other directions (LEFT and RIGHT) don't lead to immediate apples, so moving UP is the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","Let me analyze the game board:\n\n```\n########\n# A    #\n#A H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nHere's what I can observe:\n- The snake's head 'H' is at the third row, fourth column.\n- There are 3 apples ('A') on the board:\n  - One at the second row, second column\n  - One at the third row, first column\n  - One at the sixth row, seventh column\n- The current direction is UP.\n- We're at epoch 3.\n\nSince the snake is currently moving UP, my options are:\n- Continue moving UP\n- Turn LEFT\n- Turn RIGHT\n\nI cannot move DOWN as that would be a direct reversal of the current direction.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n1. UP: If I move UP, the snake's head will move to the second row, fourth column. There's no apple there, so I'll just move without growing.\n\n2. LEFT: If I move LEFT, the snake's head will move to the third row, third column. There's no apple there, so I'll just move without growing.\n\n3. RIGHT: If I move RIGHT, the snake's head will move to the third row, fifth column. There's no apple there, so I'll just move without growing.\n\nLet me think strategically. I want to eat apples to increase my score and grow the snake. The closest apple is the one at the third row, first column (to the left of the snake's head). To reach it, I should move LEFT now.\n\nIf I move LEFT now, I'll be at (3, 3). Then, with another LEFT move, I'll be at (3, 2). And with a third LEFT move, I'll be at (3, 1), which is where the apple is.\n\nSo, my decision is to move LEFT.\n\nLet me summarize:\n- Game Board: As provided\n- Current Direction: UP\n- Decision: LEFT (to start moving towards the nearest apple)Game board:\n```\n########\n# A    #\n#A H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nI need to choose a direction for the snake, which is currently moving UP. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n- The snake's head 'H' is at row 3, column 4\n- There are three apples: one above and to the left, one directly to the left, and one at the bottom right\n- Since I'm moving UP, I can either continue UP, turn LEFT, or turn RIGHT (can't go DOWN as that would be a reversal)\n\nThe closest apple is directly to the left of the snake's head. If I move LEFT, I can start moving toward this apple.\n\nMoving UP would take me further from the closest apple, while moving RIGHT doesn't immediately lead toward any apple.\n\nTherefore, I'll choose to move LEFT to start moving toward the closest apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Let me first understand the game state from the information provided:\n\n- The game board is 8x8, with walls (#) around the edges.\n- The snake's head (H) is currently at the third row, second column.\n- There are three apples (A) on the board: one at the second row, second column; one at the third row, first column; and one at the sixth row, seventh column.\n- The snake's current direction is LEFT.\n- The current epoch is 4.\n\nNow, let me think about the possible directions I can choose. Since the snake is currently moving LEFT, I cannot choose RIGHT (as the snake cannot reverse its direction).\n\nI can choose from:\n1. LEFT (continue in the same direction)\n2. UP\n3. DOWN\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n1. LEFT: If I go LEFT, the snake will move to the position where an apple is (third row, first column). The snake will eat the apple, grow in length, and the score will increase by 1.\n\n2. UP: If I go UP, the snake will move to the position where an apple is (second row, second column). The snake will eat the apple, grow in length, and the score will increase by 1.\n\n3. DOWN: If I go DOWN, the snake will move to an empty space. The snake will not eat any apple, and the score will remain the same.\n\nBased on these analyses, both LEFT and UP directions lead to eating an apple. I'll choose LEFT since it continues the snake's current direction without making a turn, and it allows the snake to eat an apple, grow in length, and increase the score.\n\nActually, I need to reconsider. The game is about maximizing the score, which means eating as many apples as possible. So I should choose the direction that helps the snake eat apples most efficiently.\n\nIf I go LEFT, the snake will eat the apple at (third row, first column), and then the snake's head will be at the edge of the board. The snake will not be able to move LEFT anymore (as it would hit the wall), and it would need to go either UP or DOWN.\n\nIf I go UP, the snake will eat the apple at (second row, second column), and then the snake's head will be one row away from the edge. The snake will still have the option to go LEFT, UP, or RIGHT.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy, going UP might be more beneficial as it provides more flexibility for the snake's movement in the next step. However, the game's objective is to maximize the score, not necessarily to have more movement options.\n\nLet me reconsider again. If I go LEFT, the snake will eat an apple and then be positioned near the wall. This might make it harder to reach other apples, especially the one at the sixth row, seventh column. If I go UP, the snake will eat an apple and then be in a more central position, making it easier to navigate to other apples.\n\nConsidering the positions of the remaining apples and the long-term strategy, I think going UP is the better choice.\n\nWait, I need to re-read the problem statement carefully. The snake is currently in the direction LEFT, and I need to provide the next direction. As specified in the problem, I need to provide one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP', or 'DOWN'.\n\nBased on my analysis, I'll choose UP as the next direction.\n\nAcutally, I need to make sure where the head of the snake is. The head is represented by 'H'. Let's check the game board again:\n\n```\n########\n# A    #\n#AH    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at the third row, third column, not the second column as I misinterpreted earlier. The snake's current direction is LEFT, meaning it's moving from right to left. Let's reanalyze:\n\n1. LEFT: If I go LEFT, the snake will move to the position where an apple is (third row, second column). The snake will eat the apple, grow in length, and the score will increase by 1.\n\n2. UP: If I go UP, the snake will move to the position where an apple is (second row, third column). Oops, actually there's no apple there. There's an apple at (second row, second column), but the snake won't reach that by moving UP once.\n\n3. DOWN: If I go DOWN, the snake will move to an empty space. The snake will not eat any apple, and the score will remain the same.\n\nBased on these analyses, going LEFT leads to eating an apple, while the other directions don't. I'll choose LEFT as the next direction.\n\nWait, I need to read more carefully. Here's the game board:\n\n```\n########\n# A    #\n#AH    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at the third row, third column, and there's an apple (A) at the third row, first column (not second column). Let me reanalyze:\n\nHmm, let me check more carefully:\nRow 1: ########\nRow 2: # A    #\nRow 3: #AH    #\nRow 4: #      #\nRow 5: #      #\nRow 6: #     A#\nRow 7: #      #\nRow 8: ########\n\nSo the snake's head (H) is at row 3, column 3, and there's an apple (A) at row 3, column 2 (the cell right before the head). If the snake's current direction is LEFT, that means the head will move to position (3, 2) in the next step if the direction remains LEFT.\n\n1. LEFT: If I go LEFT, the snake will move to the position where an apple is (third row, second column). The snake will eat the apple, grow in length, and the score will increase by 1.\n\n2. UP: If I go UP, the snake will move to the position (second row, third column), which is an empty space.\n\n3. DOWN: If I go DOWN, the snake will move to the position (fourth row, third column), which is also an empty space.\n\nSince going LEFT leads to eating an apple, and the other directions don't, I'll choose LEFT as the next direction.\n\nWait, let me double-check the Xs and Ys:\n(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (0,5) (0,6) (0,7)\n(1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7)\n(2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6) (2,7)\n(3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6) (3,7)\n(4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6) (4,7)\n(5,0) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (5,7)\n(6,0) (6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (6,7)\n(7,0) (7,1) (7,2) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7)\n\nAnd let me map the board:\n(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (0,5) (0,6) (0,7) = ########\n(1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) = # A    #\n(2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6) (2,7) = #AH    #\n(3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6) (3,7) = #      #\n(4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6) (4,7) = #      #\n(5,0) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (5,7) = #     A#\n(6,0) (6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (6,7) = #      #\n(7,0) (7,1) (7,2) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) = ########\n\nSo the snake's head (H) is at (2,2), and there's an apple (A) at (2,1).\n\nLet's reanalyze:\n\n1. LEFT: If I go LEFT, the snake will move to the position (2,1), where there's an apple. The snake will eat the apple, grow in length, and the score will increase by 1.\n\n2. UP: If I go UP, the snake will move to the position (1,2). There's an apple at (1,2), so the snake will eat the apple, grow in length, and the score will increase by 1.\n\n3. DOWN: If I go DOWN, the snake will move to the position (3,2), which is an empty space. The snake will not eat any apple, and the score will remain the same.\n\nBased on these analyses, both LEFT and UP lead to eating an apple. Given that the objective is to maximize the score by eating as many apples as possible, either LEFT or UP would be a good choice.\n\nConsidering the positions of the remaining apples and the long-term strategy, I think going LEFT is slightly better because it's already in the direction the snake is moving, and it keeps the snake in a more central position to navigate to the other apples (especially the one at (5,6)).\n\nSo, my final answer is LEFT.\n\nActually, I should be indexing from 1, not 0, to be consistent with the rest of the problem statement. Let me rework:\nRow 1: ########\nRow 2: # A    #\nRow 3: #AH    #\nRow 4: #      #\nRow 5: #      #\nRow 6: #     A#\nRow 7: #      #\nRow 8: ########\n\nSo the snake's head (H) is at row 3, column 3, and there's an apple (A) at row 3, column 1, and another apple (A) at row 2, column 2. If the snake's current direction is LEFT, that means the head will move to position (3, 2) in the next step if the direction remains LEFT.\n\nHmm wait, actually I think my indexing is wrong. Let me look at the board again character by character:\n\nRow 1, Column 1: #\nRow 1, Column 2: #\n...\nRow 1, Column 8: #\n\nRow 2, Column 1: #\nRow 2, Column 2: (space)\nRow 2, Column 3: A\n...\nRow 2, Column 8: #\n\nRow 3, Column 1: #\nRow 3, Column 2: A\nRow 3, Column 3: H\n...\nRow 3, Column 8: #\n\n...\n\nSo the snake's head (H) is at row 3, column 3, and there's an apple (A) at row 3, column 2, and another apple (A) at row 2, column 3.\n\n1. LEFT: If I go LEFT, the snake will move to the position (3,2), where there's an apple. The snake will eat the apple, grow in length, and the score will increase by 1.\n\n2. UP: If I go UP, the snake will move to the position (2,3), where there's an apple. The snake will eat the apple, grow in length, and the score will increase by 1.\n\n3. DOWN: If I go DOWN, the snake will move to the position (4,3), which is an empty space. The snake will not eat any apple, and the score will remain the same.\n\nBased on these analyses, both LEFT and UP lead to eating an apple. Given that the objective is to maximize the score by eating as many apples as possible, either LEFT or UP would be a good choice.\n\nConsidering that the snake is currently moving LEFT, and continuing in the same direction would eat an apple, I think LEFT is a good choice.\n\nSo, my final answer is LEFT.Game board:\n```\n########\n# A    #\n#AH    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nLooking at the game board, the snake's head (H) is currently at the third row, third column. The snake is moving LEFT, which means it's moving from right to left.\n\nI need to decide which direction to move next. Let me analyze my options:\n\n1. LEFT: If I continue moving LEFT, the snake will move to position (row 3, column 2), where there's an apple (A). The snake will eat this apple, grow in length, and increase the score by 1.\n\n2. UP: If I turn UP, the snake will move to position (row 2, column 3), where there's also an apple (A). This would also result in eating an apple, growing in length, and increasing the score.\n\n3. DOWN: If I turn DOWN, the snake will move to position (row 4, column 3), which is an empty space. No apple would be eaten.\n\nSince both LEFT and UP would allow the snake to eat an apple, both are good choices. However, since the snake is already moving LEFT, I'll choose to continue in that direction rather than making a turn. This will allow the snake to eat the apple and maintain momentum.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Let me analyze the game board and the current state.\n\n```\n########\n# A    #\n#HS    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nThe snake head 'H' is at the leftmost position of the third row from the top, and the snake has a body segment 'S' to its right. The current direction is LEFT.\n\nGiven the current direction (LEFT), if I continue moving LEFT, the snake head will hit the wall '#' on the left edge of the board, which would result in a game over. So moving LEFT is not a valid option.\n\nThe snake cannot reverse its direction directly, so moving RIGHT is not a valid option either, as it would be a direct reversal of the current direction LEFT.\n\nSo, I can either move UP or DOWN:\n- If I move UP, the snake head will move to the position currently occupied by 'A' (an apple). The snake will eat the apple, grow in length, and increase the score by 1.\n- If I move DOWN, the snake head will move to an empty position.\n\nSince the goal is to eat as many apples as possible and grow the snake in length, moving UP seems to be the better choice, as it allows the snake to eat an apple and increase its score.\n\nSo, my chosen direction is UP.\n\nLet's visualize the next state of the board if I move UP:\n\n- The snake head 'H' will move to the position of the apple 'A'.\n- The current head position will become a snake body segment 'S'.\n- The score will increase by 1.\n\nThe updated board would look like:\n```\n########\n#HA    #\n#SS    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nSo, I'm choosing to move UP to eat the apple and increase the score.Game board:\n```\n########\n# A    #\n#HS    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nI'll analyze the current state and determine the best move.\n\nThe snake's head (H) is currently at the left side of the 3rd row, with a body segment (S) to its right. The snake is currently moving LEFT.\n\nSince the snake is moving LEFT, continuing in that direction would make the snake hit the wall, which would end the game. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is not allowed as it would be a direct reversal).\n\nLooking at the available options:\n- UP: There's an apple directly above the snake's head\n- DOWN: There's an empty space\n\nSince the goal is to eat apples and grow the snake, moving UP is the optimal choice. This will allow the snake to eat the apple and gain a point.\n\nAnswer: UP","Let me analyze the current game board and determine the best direction to move.\n\nFirst, let me repeat the current game state:\n\nGame board:\n```\n########\n#HA    #\n#S     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 6\n\nIn this game, the snake is represented by 'H' (head) and 'S' (body). Looking at the board, I can see that:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at the top row next to the left wall\n- The snake has a body segment ('S') right below the head\n- There's an apple ('A') right next to the snake's head\n- There are two more apples on the board: one in the bottom-right area and one in the bottom-middle area\n\nThe current direction is UP, which means the snake is moving upward. However, since the snake is already at the top row next to a wall, moving UP would cause the snake to collide with the wall and lose the game. So I shouldn't choose UP.\n\nLet's consider my options:\n1. LEFT: This would cause the snake to hit the left wall and lose the game. Not a valid option.\n2. RIGHT: This would allow the snake to move to the right, avoiding any immediate collision. There's also an apple right next to the snake, so going RIGHT would let the snake eat it immediately.\n3. DOWN: This would make the snake move back onto its body segment, causing a collision with itself. Not a valid option.\n\nSo my best option is to go RIGHT, which will allow the snake to eat an apple and continue the game safely.\n\nAnswer: RIGHTGame board:\n```\n########\n#HA    #\n#S     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nLooking at the current game board, I need to decide the best direction to move.\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is currently at the top row, with the body ('S') right below it. The current direction is UP, but I can't continue moving UP because that would cause a collision with the wall.\n\nI can see there's an apple ('A') directly to the right of the snake's head. If I move RIGHT, I can immediately eat this apple, increase my score, and grow the snake.\n\nMoving LEFT would cause a collision with the wall, which would end the game.\nMoving DOWN would cause a collision with the snake's own body ('S'), which would also end the game.\n\nTherefore, the only safe and beneficial move is to go RIGHT, which will allow me to eat the apple and continue the game.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Let's understand the current game state:\n\n1. The game board is 8x8.\n2. The snake's head 'H' is located at position (1, 3) (row 1, column 3, 0-indexed).\n3. The snake's body parts 'S' are at positions (1, 1) and (1, 2) (row 1, columns 1 and 2).\n4. There are three apples 'A' on the board: at positions (1, 6), (5, 7), and (6, 4).\n5. The snake is currently moving to the RIGHT.\n6. It's epoch 7 of the game.\n\nNow, I need to decide which direction to move the snake in next. The primary goal is to eat the apple that's closest to the snake's head without colliding with itself or walls.\n\nLooking at the map, there's an apple at (1, 6) which is 3 steps to the right of the snake's head. The snake's current direction is RIGHT, so it can continue moving in that direction to reach this apple.\n\nLet's analyze the possible moves:\n1. UP: Would move into empty space at (0, 3).\n2. DOWN: Would move into empty space at (2, 3).\n3. RIGHT: Would move into empty space at (1, 4) and continue towards the apple at (1, 6).\n4. LEFT: Not a valid move because it goes against the snake's current direction (RIGHT).\n\nSince the snake's goal is to eat apples and grow, and there's an apple to the right, continuing in the RIGHT direction seems like the best choice. This will move the snake towards the closest apple, and there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nTherefore, the snake should continue moving RIGHT to reach the apple at (1, 6).\n\nActually, I should be more careful. Let me double-check the directions to ensure they're correct. \n\nIf the snake's head is at (1, 3) and I say positions are 0-indexed, then:\n- UP would be (0, 3)\n- DOWN would be (2, 3)\n- LEFT would be (1, 2)\n- RIGHT would be (1, 4)\n\nActually, I think I should be even more explicit with the board layout. Let me rewrite the game board using coordinates to make it clearer.\n\n########  (0, 0) to (0, 7)\n#SH  A #  (1, 0) to (1, 7)\n#S     #  (2, 0) to (2, 7)\n#      #  (3, 0) to (3, 7)\n#      #  (4, 0) to (4, 7)\n#     A#  (5, 0) to (5, 7)\n#   A  #  (6, 0) to (6, 7)\n########  (7, 0) to (7, 7)\n\nI can see that:\n- The snake's head 'H' is at position (1, 2).\n- There's an 'S' (snake's body) at positions (1, 1) and (2, 1).\n- There are apples 'A' at positions (1, 6), (5, 6), and (6, 3).\n\nBut now let me look at the board without adding coordinates to avoid confusion:\n\n```\n########\n#SH  A #\n#S     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nRow 0: ########\nRow 1: #SH  A #\nRow 2: #S     #\nRow 3: #      #\nRow 4: #      #\nRow 5: #     A#\nRow 6: #   A  #\nRow 7: ########\n\nSo, the snake's head 'H' is at position (1, 2) (row 1, column 2, 0-indexed).\nThe snake's body parts 'S' are at positions (1, 1) and (2, 1) (row 1, column 1 and row 2, column 1).\nThere are three apples 'A' on the board: at positions (1, 6), (5, 6), and (6, 3).\n\n(Actually, let's be more precise. The columns of the map actually start with a \"#\" at the border. So the snake's head is at row 1, column 2 where we're indexing from 0. The borders are at row 0 (top), row 7 (bottom), column 0 (left), and column 7 (right).\n\nActually, it looks like I'm getting confused about the indexing. I should forget about 0-indexing, 1-indexing, or any other indexing, and just directly describe the board.\n\nThe board is:\n```\n########\n#SH  A #\n#S     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at the third character of the second row.\nThe snake's body 'S' is at the second character of the second row and the second character of the third row.\nThere are three apples 'A':\n1. At the 7th character of the second row (same row as the snake's head, 4 positions to the right).\n2. At the 7th character of the 6th row.\n3. At the 4th character of the 7th row.\n\nGiven that the snake's current direction is RIGHT, my four potential moves would be:\n- RIGHT: Continue in the same direction, moving the snake's head one position to the right.\n- UP: Turn the snake upward, moving the head one position up.\n- DOWN: Turn the snake downward, moving the head one position down.\n- LEFT: This is invalid since the snake cannot reverse its direction directly.\n\nLet's visualize these moves:\n\nCurrent board:\n```\n########\n#SH  A #\n#S     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nAfter moving RIGHT:\n```\n########\n#S H A #\n#S     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nAfter moving UP:\n```\n########\n# H  A #\n#SS    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nAfter moving DOWN:\n```\n########\n#S   A #\n#SH    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nLooking at these outcomes, moving RIGHT brings me closer to an apple without any immediate dangers. Moving UP or DOWN doesn't immediately bring me closer to any apple. Since my goal is to eat apples and grow in length, I should move RIGHT.\n\nI'll output the current game board and then give the answer as \"RIGHT\".Game board:\n```\n########\n#SH  A #\n#S     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nI need to decide which direction to move the snake in. Currently, the snake is moving RIGHT.\n\nLooking at the board:\n- The snake's head (H) is at the beginning of row 2\n- There's an apple (A) 4 spaces to the right of the head in the same row\n- There are two other apples, but they're further away\n- The snake's body (S) extends to the left and down\n\nSince the snake is already moving RIGHT, and there's an apple directly in that path, the best move is to continue moving RIGHT. This will bring the snake closer to the nearest apple without risking collision with the walls or itself.\n\nMoving UP or DOWN would take the snake away from the closest apple, and moving LEFT isn't possible since it's the opposite of the current direction.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Let's analyze the current game board:\n\n```\n########\n#SSH A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 8\n\nIn this Snake game, I control a snake with the head 'H' and body segments 'S'. I see:\n- The snake's head 'H' is in the second row, fourth column, moving RIGHT\n- The snake has two body segments 'S' (so total length is 3)\n- There are three apples 'A' on the board:\n  - One in the second row, sixth column (directly in the snake's path if it keeps moving right)\n  - One in the sixth row, seventh column\n  - One in the seventh row, fourth column\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT, which means the snake is moving horizontally to the right. I need to decide the next direction: LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN.\n\nSince the snake cannot reverse its direction directly, I cannot choose LEFT (opposite of the current RIGHT direction).\n\nMy options are:\n1. Continue going RIGHT - This will make the snake eat the apple that's right in its path\n2. Turn UP - Move the snake upward\n3. Turn DOWN - Move the snake downward\n\nIf I go RIGHT, I'll eat an apple immediately, which is good for scoring. Let's check if any of the directions would lead to an immediate collision:\n\n- RIGHT: The next square contains an apple, no collision\n- UP: The next square would be a wall (#), which would cause a collision\n- DOWN: The next square is empty, no collision\n\nBased on this analysis, I should go RIGHT to eat the apple that's directly in front of the snake's head.\n\nActually, I need to double-check the board again. The snake's head is at the 'H' position, which is in the top row (row 1), and the 'S' segments are to its left. So the RIGHT direction will lead to the apple, UP would hit the wall, and DOWN would move into an empty space.\n\nLet me re-examine the board more carefully:\n\n```\n########\n#SSH A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nI see:\n- Row 1: Border wall\n- Row 2: Snake segments 'SS' followed by head 'H', then a space, then an apple 'A'\n- Rows 3-6: Empty except for apples\n- Row 7: Border wall\n\nSo the snake's head is in row 2, column 4, and is moving RIGHT. The available directions are:\n- Continue RIGHT (will eat an apple)\n- Turn DOWN (will move to an empty space)\n- Cannot go UP (would hit the wall)\n- Cannot go LEFT (cannot reverse direction)\n\nGoing RIGHT is the best choice as it allows the snake to eat an apple immediately.\n\nTherefore, my answer is RIGHT.I'll analyze the current game board:\n\n```\n########\n#SSH A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 8\n\nLooking at the current situation:\n- The snake has a head 'H' and two body segments 'SS', making a total length of 3\n- The snake is currently moving RIGHT\n- There's an apple 'A' directly in the snake's path if it continues moving right\n- There are two other apples: one in the bottom-right area and one in the bottom-left area\n- Going UP would hit the wall (game over)\n- Going LEFT would try to reverse direction (not allowed)\n- Going DOWN would move to an empty space (safe but doesn't get an apple)\n- Continuing RIGHT will immediately eat an apple (increasing score)\n\nThe best move is to continue moving RIGHT to eat the apple that's directly in front of the snake. This will increase the score and grow the snake.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Let's analyze the current game state:\n\n1. The board size is 8x8 with walls ('#') around the edges.\n2. The snake's head ('H') is currently at the right side of the snake.\n3. The snake has a body length of 3 ('SSS'), so the total length is 4 including the head.\n4. There are 2 apples ('A') on the board.\n5. The current direction of the snake is RIGHT.\n\nGiven the snake is moving RIGHT, let's consider each possible move:\n\n1. RIGHT: The snake would move one square to the right. Looking at the board, if the snake moves to the right, it would eat an apple because there is an 'A' to its right. This is a valid move.\n\n2. UP: The snake would move one square up. Looking at the board, the snake can move up without hitting a wall or itself. This is a valid move.\n\n3. DOWN: The snake would move one square down. Looking at the board, the snake can move down without hitting a wall or itself. This is a valid move.\n\n4. LEFT: Since the snake is currently moving RIGHT, it cannot immediately move LEFT as per the rules (the snake cannot reverse its direction).\n\nSince the snake can eat an apple by moving RIGHT, and the goal is to eat as many apples as possible, the best move is to go RIGHT.\n\nHowever, actually, let me double-check the specific positions to make sure I understand correctly, since I kind of eyeballed the board rather than analyzing specific positions.\n\nThe game board is:\n```\n########\n# SSHA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nLet's identify the exact positions of the snake's head and body:\n- The snake's head ('H') is on the second row, fifth column.\n- The snake's body ('SSS') is on the second row, second to fourth columns.\n\nAnd the apples ('A') are at:\n- Second row, sixth column (immediate right of the snake's head).\n- Sixth row, sixth column.\n- Seventh row, fourth column.\n\nSo, if the snake moves RIGHT, it will eat the apple at the second row, sixth column. This confirms that moving RIGHT is the best option in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, my answer is: RIGHT.\n\nActually wait, let me reanalyze the board more carefully to make sure I'm parsing it correctly:\n\n```\n########\n# SSHA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nRow 1: ########\nRow 2: # SSHA #\nRow 3: #      #\nRow 4: #      #\nRow 5: #      #\nRow 6: #     A#\nRow 7: #   A  #\nRow 8: ########\n\nStarting from the top-left corner, and counting 1-indexed (meaning the top-left corner is (1, 1)), I see:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at position (2, 5).\n- The snake's body consists of:\n  - 'S' at position (2, 4).\n  - 'S' at position (2, 3).\n  - 'S' at position (2, 2).\n- Apples ('A') are at positions:\n  - (2, 6).\n  - (6, 6).\n  - (7, 4).\n\nGiven the current direction of the snake (RIGHT), the valid moves are:\n- RIGHT: This would move the snake's head to position (2, 6), where there's an apple. The snake would eat the apple and grow in length.\n- UP: This would move the snake's head to position (1, 5), but there's a wall there, so this move would result in a collision and end the game.\n- DOWN: This would move the snake's head to position (3, 5), which is an empty space.\n\nSince moving RIGHT would allow the snake to eat an apple, and moving UP would result in a collision with the wall, and moving DOWN would just move to an empty space, the best move is RIGHT.\n\nOh wait, I misread the board. Let me count again. Actually, let's just use 0-indexed for clarity (the top-left corner is (0, 0)):\n\nRow 0: ########\nRow 1: # SSHA #\nRow 2: #      #\nRow 3: #      #\nRow 4: #      #\nRow 5: #     A#\nRow 6: #   A  #\nRow 7: ########\n\n- The snake's head ('H') is at position (1, 5).\n- The snake's body consists of:\n  - 'S' at position (1, 4).\n  - 'S' at position (1, 3).\n  - 'S' at position (1, 2).\n- Apples ('A') are at positions:\n  - (1, 6).\n  - (5, 6).\n  - (6, 4).\n\nOk, so let me reivse the possible moves:\n- RIGHT: This would move the snake's head to position (1, 6), where there's an apple. The snake would eat the apple and grow in length.\n- UP: This would move the snake's head to position (0, 5), but there's a wall there, so this move would result in a collision and end the game.\n- DOWN: This would move the snake's head to position (2, 5), which is an empty space.\n\nSo, the best move is still RIGHT since it allows the snake to eat an apple.\n\nActually, now I'm getting confused. Let me just analyze the board character by character to ensure I understand correctly:\n\n```\n########\n# SSHA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nBoard coordinates (0-indexed):\n(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (0,5) (0,6) (0,7)\n(1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7)\n(2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6) (2,7)\n(3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6) (3,7)\n(4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6) (4,7)\n(5,0) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (5,7)\n(6,0) (6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (6,7)\n(7,0) (7,1) (7,2) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7)\n\nContent of the board:\n(0,0): # (0,1): # (0,2): # (0,3): # (0,4): # (0,5): # (0,6): # (0,7): #\n(1,0): # (1,1): \" \" (1,2): S (1,3): S (1,4): S (1,5): H (1,6): A (1,7): #\n(2,0): # (2,1): \" \" (2,2): \" \" (2,3): \" \" (2,4): \" \" (2,5): \" \" (2,6): \" \" (2,7): #\n(3,0): # (3,1): \" \" (3,2): \" \" (3,3): \" \" (3,4): \" \" (3,5): \" \" (3,6): \" \" (3,7): #\n(4,0): # (4,1): \" \" (4,2): \" \" (4,3): \" \" (4,4): \" \" (4,5): \" \" (4,6): \" \" (4,7): #\n(5,0): # (5,1): \" \" (5,2): \" \" (5,3): \" \" (5,4): \" \" (5,5): \" \" (5,6): A (5,7): #\n(6,0): # (6,1): \" \" (6,2): \" \" (6,3): A (6,4): \" \" (6,5): \" \" (6,6): \" \" (6,7): #\n(7,0): # (7,1): # (7,2): # (7,3): # (7,4): # (7,5): # (7,6): # (7,7): #\n\nSo from this breakdown, I can confirm:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at position (1, 5).\n- The snake's body consists of:\n  - 'S' at position (1, 4).\n  - 'S' at position (1, 3).\n  - 'S' at position (1, 2).\n- Apples ('A') are at positions:\n  - (1, 6).\n  - (5, 6).\n  - (6, 3).\n\nNow, given the current direction of the snake (RIGHT), the valid moves are:\n- RIGHT: This would move the snake's head to position (1, 6), where there's an apple. The snake would eat the apple and grow in length.\n- UP: This would move the snake's head to position (0, 5), but there's a wall there, so this move would result in a collision and end the game.\n- DOWN: This would move the snake's head to position (2, 5), which is an empty space.\n\nAh, I see I messed up the parsing for the apples. But the conclusion is still the same.\n\nSince moving RIGHT would allow the snake to eat an apple, and moving UP would result in a collision with the wall, and moving DOWN would just move to an empty space, the best move is RIGHT.\n\nTherefore, my answer is: RIGHT.Game board:\n```\n########\n# SSHA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\nLooking at the game board, I need to decide the best direction to move the snake.\n\nCurrent analysis:\n- The snake's head (H) is at the right end of the snake, moving RIGHT\n- There's an apple (A) directly to the right of the snake's head\n- Moving UP would hit the wall and lose the game\n- Moving DOWN would be safe but won't get an apple\n- Moving LEFT is invalid as it would reverse direction\n- Moving RIGHT would allow the snake to eat an apple and grow\n\nSince the goal is to eat as many apples as possible, and there's an apple directly in the snake's path, the best move is to continue moving RIGHT and eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","HTTPError 529: {\"error\":{\"message\":\"-4316: Overloaded\",\"code\":\"-4307\"}}"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The snake can continue moving UP, or it can turn LEFT or RIGHT. It cannot move DOWN as that would be reversing direction.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n- UP: Move to position (3, 3). This is an empty space, so the snake would just move there.\n- LEFT: Move to position (4, 2). This is an empty space, so the snake would just move there.\n- RIGHT: Move to position (4, 4). This is an empty space, so the snake would just move there.\n\nSince none of these moves immediately leads to an apple, I'll consider the best strategic move. Generally, in Snake, you want to move toward apples while avoiding getting trapped.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (1, 6) might be a good target. To reach it, the snake would need to go UP and then RIGHT. Let's try going UP for now to get closer to this apple.\n\nSo my choice is: UP\n\nNow let me format this as required:\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n\nI'll move UP since that brings me closer to one of the apples, and it's a safe move.\n\nAnswer: UPGame board:\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n\nLooking at the current game board, I can see that I'm controlling a snake with just the head (H) currently in the middle area of the board. There are three apples (A) on the board - one in the upper right, one in the bottom left, and one in the bottom right.\n\nThe snake is currently moving UP according to the current direction. Since I cannot reverse direction (can't go DOWN), my options are to continue moving UP or turn LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nThe most strategic move would be to continue moving UP, as this brings me closer to the apple in the upper portion of the board. Moving LEFT or RIGHT would take me away from the nearest apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","Let's analyze the current game board:\n\n```\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\n- The snake head ('H') is at the center of the board.\n- There are 3 apples ('A') on the board: one in the top right area, one in the bottom left, and one in the bottom right.\n- The current direction is UP.\n- The current epoch is 2.\n\nI need to decide on a direction to move: LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. I cannot choose DOWN because it's the opposite direction of UP (the snake cannot reverse its direction directly).\n\nSince the snake is moving UP, I have three options: continue moving UP, turn LEFT, or turn RIGHT.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n1. UP: If I move UP, the snake will continue in the same direction and get closer to the apple in the top right area.\n2. LEFT: If I turn LEFT, the snake will head towards the wall on the left.\n3. RIGHT: If I turn RIGHT, the snake will head towards the wall on the right.\n\nGiven that there's an apple in the top right area, it makes sense to move UP first to get closer to it, and then later consider turning RIGHT to reach the apple.\n\nSo, I'll choose UP as my direction to move.\n\nActually, let's consider this more carefully. Let's track the positions carefully.\n\nGiven the setup, the board is an 8x8 grid (including the walls). Here's how we can label the positions:\n```\n    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n    \n0   # # # # # # # #\n1   #           A #\n2   #             #\n3   #     H       #\n4   #             #\n5   #   A         #\n6   #           A #\n7   # # # # # # # #\n```\n\nThe snake head is at position (3, 3).\nThe first apple is at (1, 5).\nThe second apple is at (5, 2).\nThe third apple is at (6, 6).\n\nIf I move UP, the snake head will move to (3, 2).\nIf I move LEFT, the snake head will move to (2, 3).\nIf I move RIGHT, the snake head will move to (4, 3).\n\nNone of these positions have an apple, so I need to think ahead.\n\nIf I want to reach the apple at (1, 5), I should move UP to get to row 1, and then RIGHT to reach column 5. So, moving UP gets me closer to that apple.\n\nIf I want to reach the apple at (5, 2), I can move RIGHT to reach column 5 and then UP to reach row 2. But since the current direction is UP, I can also move UP and then RIGHT. The path length will be the same.\n\nIf I want to reach the apple at (6, 6), I can move RIGHT to reach column 6 and then DOWN to reach row 6. Or I can move DOWN to reach row 6 and then RIGHT to reach column 6. But since the current direction is UP, I should avoid moving DOWN directly.\n\nLet's reconsider. I think my indexing is a bit confusing. Let me re-label the positions in a clearer way, using (row, column) notation and the top-left as (0, 0):\n\n```\n(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (0,5) (0,6) (0,7)\n(1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7)\n(2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6) (2,7)\n(3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6) (3,7)\n(4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6) (4,7)\n(5,0) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (5,7)\n(6,0) (6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (6,7)\n(7,0) (7,1) (7,2) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7)\n```\n\nSo the board looks like:\n```\n# # # # # # # #\n#         A   #\n#             #\n#     H       #\n#             #\n#   A         #\n#           A #\n# # # # # # # #\n```\n\nThe snake head is at (3, 3).\nThe apples are at (1, 5), (5, 2), and (6, 6).\n\nIf I move UP, the snake head will move to (2, 3).\nIf I move LEFT, the snake head will move to (3, 2).\nIf I move RIGHT, the snake head will move to (3, 4).\n\nNone of these positions have an apple, so I need to think ahead.\n\nGiven the positions, let's evaluate the distances to each apple:\n\nFor the apple at (1, 5):\n- UP -> (2, 3): Distance = |2-1| + |3-5| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- LEFT -> (3, 2): Distance = |3-1| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5\n- RIGHT -> (3, 4): Distance = |3-1| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nFor the apple at (5, 2):\n- UP -> (2, 3): Distance = |2-5| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4\n- LEFT -> (3, 2): Distance = |3-5| + |2-2| = 2 + 0 = 2\n- RIGHT -> (3, 4): Distance = |3-5| + |4-2| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nFor the apple at (6, 6):\n- UP -> (2, 3): Distance = |2-6| + |3-6| = 4 + 3 = 7\n- LEFT -> (3, 2): Distance = |3-6| + |2-6| = 3 + 4 = 7\n- RIGHT -> (3, 4): Distance = |3-6| + |4-6| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nBased on the distances, moving LEFT gets me closest to the apple at (5, 2) with a distance of 2. Moving RIGHT gets me relatively close to the apple at (6, 6) with a distance of 5. Moving UP doesn't provide the shortest path to any of the apples.\n\nSo, based on these calculations, I think moving LEFT is the best choice.\n\nBut I should also re-evaluate these indexes. Let's look at the original board again:\n\n```\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nWait, I think I started indexing from the top-left corner, which happens to be a wall. Let me recalibrate.\n\nLet's use coordinates where (0, 0) is the top-left corner of the board, so the playable area starts at (1, 1):\n\n```\n(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (0,5) (0,6) (0,7) <- row 0\n(1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) <- row 1\n(2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6) (2,7) <- row 2\n(3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6) (3,7) <- row 3\n(4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6) (4,7) <- row 4\n(5,0) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (5,7) <- row 5\n(6,0) (6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (6,7) <- row 6\n(7,0) (7,1) (7,2) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7) <- row 7\n```\n\nSo the board will actually look like:\n```\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nLet's be specific:\n- # at (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), ... (all of row 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), ... (all of column 0), etc. (the entire perimeter)\n- H at (3, 3)\n- A at (1, 5), (5, 1), and (6, 6)\n\nIf I move UP, the snake head will move to (2, 3).\nIf I move LEFT, the snake head will move to (3, 2).\nIf I move RIGHT, the snake head will move to (3, 4).\n\nLet's recalculate the distances:\n\nFor the apple at (1, 5):\n- UP -> (2, 3): Distance = |2-1| + |3-5| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- LEFT -> (3, 2): Distance = |3-1| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5\n- RIGHT -> (3, 4): Distance = |3-1| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nFor the apple at (5, 1):\n- UP -> (2, 3): Distance = |2-5| + |3-1| = 3 + 2 = 5\n- LEFT -> (3, 2): Distance = |3-5| + |2-1| = 2 + 1 = 3\n- RIGHT -> (3, 4): Distance = |3-5| + |4-1| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nFor the apple at (6, 6):\n- UP -> (2, 3): Distance = |2-6| + |3-6| = 4 + 3 = 7\n- LEFT -> (3, 2): Distance = |3-6| + |2-6| = 3 + 4 = 7\n- RIGHT -> (3, 4): Distance = |3-6| + |4-6| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nBased on these recalculated distances, moving UP gives a distance of 3 to the top-right apple. Moving LEFT gives a distance of 3 to the bottom-left apple. Moving RIGHT gives a distance of 3 to the top-right apple and 5 to the bottom-right apple.\n\nIt seems we have a tie between UP and LEFT in terms of the shortest distance to an apple. Let me think about this more strategically.\n\nIf the current direction is UP, then continuing to move UP might be a more natural choice than turning LEFT. Also, the apple in the top-right (1, 5) is more accessible than the one in the bottom-left (5, 1), as it doesn't involve a change in direction.\n\nLet's choose UP and head towards the apple at (1, 5).\n\nWait, let me read the example again to check if my understanding is correct.\n\nOn second thought, let me reexamine the board coordinates.\n\nLooking at the original board again:\n\n```\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nThe board size is 8x8, and the outer border is all '#'. If I use 0-based indexing, the grid would look like this:\n\n```\n(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4) (0,5) (0,6) (0,7)\n(1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7)\n(2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6) (2,7)\n(3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5) (3,6) (3,7)\n(4,0) (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (4,6) (4,7)\n(5,0) (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6) (5,7)\n(6,0) (6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5) (6,6) (6,7)\n(7,0) (7,1) (7,2) (7,3) (7,4) (7,5) (7,6) (7,7)\n```\n\nThe board would be:\n```\n# # # # # # # #  <- row 0\n# . . . . A . #  <- row 1\n# . . . . . . #  <- row 2\n# . . H . . . #  <- row 3\n# . . . . . . #  <- row 4\n# . A . . . . #  <- row 5\n# . . . . . A #  <- row 6\n# # # # # # # #  <- row 7\n```\n\nHere, '.' represents empty space. So, the snake head (H) is at (3, 3), and the apples (A) are at (1, 5), (5, 1), and (6, 6).\n\nIf the snake's head is currently at (3, 3) and the current direction is UP:\n\n- If I choose UP, the snake's head will move to (2, 3).\n- If I choose LEFT, the snake's head will move to (3, 2).\n- If I choose RIGHT, the snake's head will move to (3, 4).\n\nLet's recalculate the distances to the apples:\n\nFor the apple at (1, 5):\n- From (2, 3): Distance = |2-1| + |3-5| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- From (3, 2): Distance = |3-1| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5\n- From (3, 4): Distance = |3-1| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nFor the apple at (5, 1):\n- From (2, 3): Distance = |2-5| + |3-1| = 3 + 2 = 5\n- From (3, 2): Distance = |3-5| + |2-1| = 2 + 1 = 3\n- From (3, 4): Distance = |3-5| + |4-1| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nFor the apple at (6, 6):\n- From (2, 3): Distance = |2-6| + |3-6| = 4 + 3 = 7\n- From (3, 2): Distance = |3-6| + |2-6| = 3 + 4 = 7\n- From (3, 4): Distance = |3-6| + |4-6| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nNow, let's analyze the consequences:\n1. If we move UP, we get closer to the apple at (1, 5).\n2. If we move LEFT, we get closer to the apple at (5, 1).\n3. If we move RIGHT, we get closer to the apples at (1, 5) and (6, 6).\n\nGiven these options, moving RIGHT seems like the most advantageous choice: it gets us closer to two of the three apples, including the one farthest away (6, 6).\n\nSo, my decision is to move RIGHT.\n\nAcutally, I just realized I was misreading the board grid. Reading from the top left to the bottom right:\n\n```\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nInterpreting each character's position:\n- The top-left '#' is at (0, 0).\n- The walls ('#') cover the perimeter, which is row 0, row 7, column 0, and column 7.\n- The snake's head (H) is at position (3, 3).\n- One apple (A) is at (1, 5).\n- Another apple (A) is at (5, 1).\n- The third apple (A) is at (6, 5).\n\nIf the snake's current direction is UP:\n\n- If it moves UP, the head would go to (2, 3).\n- If it moves LEFT, the head would go to (3, 2).\n- If it moves RIGHT, the head would go to (3, 4).\n\nSince the rules state that the snake can't directly reverse its direction, it can't move DOWN from UP.\n\nLet's recalculate the Manhattan distances to the apples:\n\nFor the apple at (1, 5):\n- From (2, 3): Distance = |2-1| + |3-5| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- From (3, 2): Distance = |3-1| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5\n- From (3, 4): Distance = |3-1| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nFor the apple at (5, 1):\n- From (2, 3): Distance = |2-5| + |3-1| = 3 + 2 = 5\n- From (3, 2): Distance = |3-5| + |2-1| = 2 + 1 = 3\n- From (3, 4): Distance = |3-5| + |4-1| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nFor the apple at (6, 5):\n- From (2, 3): Distance = |2-6| + |3-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n- From (3, 2): Distance = |3-6| + |2-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n- From (3, 4): Distance = |3-6| + |4-5| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\nBased on these distances, moving RIGHT gets us closer to the apple at (6, 5), with a distance of 4. Moving UP and LEFT don't provide the shortest path to any of the apples.\n\nBut I'm getting confused with the positions of the apples. Let me revisit the board and be very explicit:\n\n```\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nLooking at this, the apples are:\n- One in the top row, fifth from the left (within the playable area), i.e., at (1, 5).\n- One in the fifth row, second from the left, i.e., at (5, 1).\n- One in the sixth row, sixth from the left, i.e., at (6, 6).\n\nLet's recompute the distances:\n\nFor the apple at (1, 5):\n- From (2, 3): Distance = |2-1| + |3-5| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- From (3, 2): Distance = |3-1| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5\n- From (3, 4): Distance = |3-1| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nFor the apple at (5, 1):\n- From (2, 3): Distance = |2-5| + |3-1| = 3 + 2 = 5\n- From (3, 2): Distance = |3-5| + |2-1| = 2 + 1 = 3\n- From (3, 4): Distance = |3-5| + |4-1| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nFor the apple at (6, 6):\n- From (2, 3): Distance = |2-6| + |3-6| = 4 + 3 = 7\n- From (3, 2): Distance = |3-6| + |2-6| = 3 + 4 = 7\n- From (3, 4): Distance = |3-6| + |4-6| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nMoving UP gets us closer to the apple at (1, 5) with a distance of 3. Moving LEFT gets us closer to the apple at (5, 1) with a distance of 3. Moving RIGHT gets us closer to the bottom-right apple at (6, 6) with a distance of 5.\n\nGiven that all three apples are at different locations and there's no clear \"shortest path,\" I should think about a more strategic approach. I can start by heading towards the apple at (1, 5) by moving UP. Given that the snake's direction is already UP, it's a natural choice.\n\nNow let me double check the position once more to make sure there's no ambiguity:\n\n```\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nWhere:\n- The outer \"#\" symbols represent walls and create a boundary.\n- The 'H' at position (3, 3) represents the snake's head.\n- The 'A' at position (1, 5) represents the first apple.\n- The 'A' at position (5, 1) represents the second apple.\n- The 'A' at position (6, 6) represents the third apple.\n\nGiven all of this, I'll choose to move UP in order to get closer to the apple at (1, 5).\n\nActually, wait. Let's take a closer look at this board. Tracing the coordinates and the board elements:\n\n```\n    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n0   # # # # # # # #\n1   #         A   #\n2   #             #\n3   #     H       #\n4   #             #\n5   #   A         #\n6   #           A #\n7   # # # # # # # #\n```\n\nHere, the 'H' is at (3, 3), the apples are at (1, 5), (5, 2), and (6, 6). Wait, I'm confusing myself, let's be crystal clear:\n\n```\n    01234567\n0   ########\n1   #    A #\n2   #      #\n3   #  H   #\n4   #      #\n5   # A    #\n6   #     A#\n7   ########\n```\n\nOk, so here H is at row 3, column 3. The apples are at:\n- Row 1, column 5\n- Row 5, column 1\n- Row 6, column 6\n\nIf I move UP, I'd go to (2, 3). If I move LEFT, I'd go to (3, 2). If I move RIGHT, I'd go to (3, 4).\n\nDistances to the apple at (1, 5):\n- From (2, 3): |2-1| + |3-5| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- From (3, 2): |3-1| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5\n- From (3, 4): |3-1| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nDistances to the apple at (5, 1):\n- From (2, 3): |2-5| + |3-1| = 3 + 2 = 5\n- From (3, 2): |3-5| + |2-1| = 2 + 1 = 3\n- From (3, 4): |3-5| + |4-1| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\nDistances to the apple at (6, 6):\n- From (2, 3): |2-6| + |3-6| = 4 + 3 = 7\n- From (3, 2): |3-6| + |2-6| = 3 + 4 = 7\n- From (3, 4): |3-6| + |4-6| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nMoving UP will bring us closer to the apple at (1, 5) with a distance of 3. Moving LEFT will bring us closer to the apple at (5, 1) with a distance of 3. Moving RIGHT will bring us closer to the bottom-right apple at (6, 6) with a distance of 5.\n\nGiven these options, I think moving UP is most natural (since we're already moving UP) and provides a distance of 3 to the nearest apple, which is the one at (1, 5).\n\nAlso, since the game starts with the snake moving UP, continuing in the same direction can help maintain momentum.\n\nIn conclusion, my chosen direction to move is UP.\n\nActually, let me visualize the board once more:\n\n```\n    01234567\n0   ########\n1   #    A #\n2   #      #\n3   #  H   #\n4   #      #\n5   # A    #\n6   #     A#\n7   ########\n```\n\nThe walls are at the perimeter. The snake head is at (3, 3) (where the rows and columns start from 0). The apples are at the coordinates (1, 5), (5, 1), and (6, 6).\n\nGiven this visualization, I still think moving UP is the best choice.\n\nTherefore, my answer is UP.I'll analyze the current game board and determine the best move.\n\nGame board:\n```\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 2\n\nLooking at this board, I see:\n- The snake's head (H) is at the center of the board\n- There are three apples (A) - one at the top right, one at the bottom left, and one at the bottom right\n- The snake is currently moving UP\n- Since the snake cannot reverse direction, I cannot choose DOWN\n\nMy options are:\n1. Continue moving UP - This will bring me closer to the apple at the top right\n2. Turn LEFT - This would move me toward the left side of the board\n3. Turn RIGHT - This would move me toward the right side of the board\n\nSince my current direction is UP and there's an apple near the top of the board, continuing to move UP makes the most sense. This will get me closer to the apple in the top right area.\n\nBy moving UP, the snake head will move one square higher, bringing it closer to the apple. This is the most direct path to one of the apples given the current board state.\n\nAnswer: UP","Let me analyze the game board:\n\n```\n########\n#    A #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nThe snake currently consists of just the head 'H', which is located at row 2, column 3 (if we index starting from 0, or row 3, column 4 if indexing from 1).\n\nThe current direction is UP, which means the snake is currently moving upward.\n\nThere are three apples (A) on the board:\n1. Near the top right (row 1, column 6)\n2. Near the bottom left (row 5, column 2)\n3. At the bottom right (row 6, column 7)\n\nI need to decide which direction to move. The rules state that:\n1. The snake cannot reverse its direction (so I can't choose DOWN since the current direction is UP)\n2. The goal is to eat as many apples as possible\n3. The snake loses if it collides with itself or the walls\n\nMy options are:\n- Continue moving UP\n- Turn LEFT\n- Turn RIGHT\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n1. UP: If I continue moving UP, I'll move to position (1, 3). This doesn't have an apple, but it gets me closer to the apple near the top right.\n\n2. LEFT: If I turn LEFT, I'll move to position (2, 2). This doesn't have an apple, but it would position me for potentially reaching the apple at the bottom left later.\n\n3. RIGHT: If I turn RIGHT, I'll move to position (2, 4). This doesn't have an apple, but it positions me to potentially reach the apple at the top right or the one at the bottom right.\n\nGiven that there's an apple near the top right, I think moving UP and then later RIGHT would be a good strategy to reach that apple first. The other apples are farther away.\n\nSo my decision is to move UP.\n\nActually, wait. Let me re-examine the board. If I'm at (2, 3) and I move UP, I'll be at (1, 3). The apple near the top right is at (1, 6). So I would need to move UP and then RIGHT multiple times to reach it.\n\nLet me reconsider. Since the current direction is UP, I can move:\n- Continue UP\n- Turn LEFT\n- Turn RIGHT\n\nI'll try to evaluate which path would lead me to an apple fastest:\n\n- UP, then RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT: This would take me to the apple at (1, 6) in 4 moves.\n- LEFT, then UP, UP: This would take me away from the apples.\n- RIGHT, then UP, UP, then LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT: This would also take me away from the nearest apple.\n\nIt seems like continuing to move UP and then turning RIGHT to reach the apple near the top right is the best strategy. So my answer is UP.\n\nOh wait. I think I misinterpreted. The question is asking for the direction I want to move next, not the overall strategy. \n\nGiven that the current direction is UP, my decision is to continue moving UP, which will get me closer to the apple near the top right.\n\nActually, let's think about this a bit more. The snake is at position (2, 3) (indexing from 0) and the current direction is UP. If I continue moving UP, I'll be at position (1, 3), which doesn't have an apple. I'd then need to move RIGHT multiple times to reach the apple at (1, 6).\n\nAlternatively, I could turn RIGHT now, moving to position (2, 4), and then continue RIGHT, which would place me at position (2, 5), and then (2, 6). From there, I could move UP to position (1, 6), where the apple is. This would take 4 moves.\n\nIf I move UP now, then turn RIGHT, it would take: move UP to (1, 3), then RIGHT to (1, 4), then RIGHT to (1, 5), then RIGHT to (1, 6). This is also 4 moves.\n\nBoth paths take the same number of moves to reach the apple. However, moving UP first keeps me closer to the center of the board, which might give me more flexibility in future moves. \n\nGiven this, I'll stick with my decision to move UP.\n\nThe answer is UP.\n\nActually, I should double-check if turning RIGHT is a valid move given the current direction. The problem states: \"The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).\"\n\nThis means if the current direction is UP, I can't choose DOWN (which would be a reversal). But I can choose LEFT or RIGHT, which are perpendicular to the current direction. So turning RIGHT is a valid move.\n\nGiven that both UP and RIGHT would get me to the closest apple in 4 moves, and UP might provide more flexibility for future moves, I'll still choose UP.\n\nThe answer is UP.\n\nWait, I think we need to be careful here. Let's understand our current position and the direction we're facing.\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (row 2, column 3) if indexing from 0. The current direction is UP.\n\nNow let's again analyze our options:\n\n1. Continue moving UP: The head will move to position (row 1, column 3). This doesn't have an apple.\n2. Turn LEFT: The head will move to position (row 2, column 2). This doesn't have an apple.\n3. Turn RIGHT: The head will move to position (row 2, column 4). This doesn't have an apple.\n\nSince none of the immediate moves leads to an apple, let's think about the shortest path to reach an apple.\n\nThe apple near the top right (row 1, column 6) can be reached by:\n- Moving UP, then RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT. This takes 4 moves.\n\nThe apple near the bottom left (row 5, column 2) can be reached by:\n- Turning LEFT, then moving DOWN, DOWN, DOWN. This takes 4 moves.\n\nThe apple at the bottom right (row 6, column 7) is much farther.\n\nBoth the top right and bottom left apples can be reached in 4 moves. However, by moving UP, we're moving towards the top edge of the board, which might limit our options in later moves. If we turn LEFT, we're moving towards the left edge of the board, which also has its constraints.\n\nGiven the information, both UP and LEFT seem like valid choices. But since UP allows us to continue in the current direction (which is often more intuitive in snake games) and the top right apple might offer more flexibility for future moves (since it's not in a corner), I'll choose UP.\n\nThe answer is UP.\n\nActually, let me reconsider this. Looking at the map, the apple at the top right (row 1, column 6) seems to be a bit closer than I initially thought. The snake's head is at (row 2, column 3).\n\nTo reach the top right apple, I would:\n- Move UP to (row 1, column 3), then RIGHT to (row 1, column 4), then RIGHT to (row 1, column 5), then RIGHT to (row 1, column 6). This is 4 moves.\n\nTo reach the bottom left apple, I would:\n- Turn LEFT to (row 2, column 2), then DOWN to (row 3, column 2), then DOWN to (row 4, column 2), then DOWN to (row 5, column 2). This is also 4 moves.\n\nMaybe I made an error in my previous calculation? Let me re-check the coordinates:\n\nThe game board is:\n```\n########\n#    A #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nUsing 0-indexing (start counting from 0 for rows and columns):\n- The snake's head 'H' is at (row 2, column 3)\n- The apple near the top is at (row 1, column 6)\n- The apple near the bottom left is at (row 5, column 2)\n- The apple at the bottom right is at (row 6, column 7)\n\nIf I move UP from the current position, I'd be at (row 1, column 3). Then, I'd need to move RIGHT three times to reach the apple near the top. That's a total of 4 moves.\n\nIf I turn LEFT and move, I'd be at (row 2, column 2). Then, I'd need to move DOWN three times to reach the apple near the bottom left. That's also a total of 4 moves.\n\nGiven that both the top apple and the bottom left apple can be reached in the same number of moves, I need to make a decision based on which route might offer more flexibility or advantages for future moves. Moving UP and towards the top apple seems like a good choice since it keeps us away from the corners of the board. That'll give us more room to maneuver once we've eaten that apple.\n\nThe answer is UP.\n\nActually, I made another oversight. If my current direction is UP, and I choose to move UP, then the snake's head will be at (row 1, column 3) after the move. I'd then need to turn RIGHT and move RIGHT three times to reach the apple. That's a total of 4 moves.\n\nIf I choose to turn RIGHT (which is a valid move if the current direction is UP), then the snake's head will be at (row 2, column 4) after the move. I'd then need to move RIGHT twice more, then turn UP and move UP once to reach the apple. That's also a total of 4 moves.\n\nBut I made yet another oversight. Since the current direction is UP, if I move LEFT, then by the rules of the game, the snake would turn to the left (relative to the current direction) and move in that direction. In this case, turning LEFT would cause the snake to move LEFT, not in the UP-LEFT direction, which would place the head at (row 2, column 2).\n\nSo, to clarify:\n- If I move UP, I'd be at (row 1, column 3).\n- If I turn and move LEFT, I'd be at (row 2, column 2).\n- If I turn and move RIGHT, I'd be at (row 2, column 4).\n\nNow, let's reconsider the paths to the apples:\n\nTo reach the top apple at (row 1, column 6):\n- If I move UP, I'd be at (row 1, column 3). Then, I'd need to turn RIGHT and move RIGHT three times. That's a total of 4 moves.\n- If I turn RIGHT, I'd be at (row 2, column 4). Then, I'd need to move RIGHT to (row 2, column 5), move RIGHT to (row 2, column 6), then turn UP and move UP to (row 1, column 6). That's a total of 4 moves.\n\nTo reach the bottom left apple at (row 5, column 2):\n- If I turn LEFT, I'd be at (row 2, column 2). Then, I'd need to turn DOWN and move DOWN three times. That's a total of 4 moves.\n\nActually, the \"current direction\" means the direction the snake is moving. So the snake is not facing UP, its's moving in the UP direction. So to clarify:\n- If I continue moving UP, I'd be at (row 1, column 3).\n- If I turn and move LEFT, I'd be at (row 2, column 2).\n- If I turn and move RIGHT, I'd be at (row 2, column 4).\n\nEither I choose UP, RIGHT, or LEFT, I'm not directly eating an apple. Instead, I need to think about the most efficient path to reach an apple.\n\nAfter reanalysis, moving UP seems like a good choice because it keeps us away from the edges and corners of the board, giving more flexibility for future moves.\n\nThe answer is UP.\n\nThat's my final answer.First, let me repeat the current game board:\n\n```\n########\n#    A #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nLooking at the current situation:\n- The snake consists only of its head 'H' at the 3rd row\n- Current direction is UP\n- There are three apples: one near the top-right, one at the bottom-left, and one at the bottom-right\n- We cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is not an option)\n\nI need to decide whether to continue moving UP or turn LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nIf I move UP, I'll be one step closer to the apple near the top. From there, I could turn right to reach that apple in a few more moves.\n\nIf I turn LEFT, I'd be moving toward the apple at the bottom-left, but would need to turn DOWN afterward.\n\nIf I turn RIGHT, I'd initially move away from both nearby apples.\n\nSince I'm currently moving UP and there's an apple I can reach by continuing in this direction and then turning right, I'll continue moving UP. This keeps me away from the edges of the board and provides flexibility for future moves.\n\nAnswer: UP","Let me analyze the game board:\n\n```\n########\n#  H A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 4\n\nSo, the game board is an 8x8 grid, with walls ('#') around the edges. The snake's head ('H') is currently at coordinates (2,3) (considering 0-indexed, where 0,0 is the top-left corner).\n\nThere are three apples ('A') on the board:\n1. At coordinates (2,5)\n2. At coordinates (5,2)\n3. At coordinates (6,7)\n\nThe snake doesn't have a body yet (no 'S' characters), so its length is just 1 (just the head).\n\nThe snake is currently moving UP, which means it's moving in the negative-y direction.\n\nSo if the snake continues moving UP, the head will move from (2,3) to (1,3), which would be a valid move since there's no wall, body segment, or apple at that position.\n\nI need to consider my options:\n1. Continue moving UP\n2. Turn LEFT\n3. Turn RIGHT\n\nNote: The snake cannot move DOWN since that would be a 180-degree turn, which is not allowed.\n\nIf I move UP, I'll move to an empty space.\nIf I move LEFT, I'll move to an empty space.\nIf I move RIGHT, I'll move to an empty space.\n\nLet's consider the strategic value of each move:\n\n1. UP - This keeps me moving in the direction of one of the walls. I don't want to hit the wall, so I need to turn at some point.\n2. LEFT - This would take me towards the left wall.\n3. RIGHT - This would take me towards the right wall, but also towards an apple at (2,5).\n\nSince one of my objectives is to eat apples, and moving RIGHT would take me towards an apple, I think RIGHT is the best move here.\n\nSo my answer is: RIGHT\n\nChecking my logic once more: \n- If I move RIGHT, I'll move from (2,3) to (2,4), which is empty.\n- In the next move, if I continue moving RIGHT, I'll be at (2,5) which is an apple, so I'll eat it and increase my score.\n\nWait, I think I made an error in my coordinates. Let me check again.\n\nLet's define coordinates more clearly. Let's define (i, j) where i is the row (starting from 0 at the top) and j is the column (starting from 0 at the left).\n\nThe board is:\n```\n########\n#  H A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nH is at (1, 3).\nApples are at (1, 5), (5, 2), and (6, 7).\n\nNow, let's consider the moves again:\n\n1. UP - Moving from (1, 3) to (0, 3) would hit the wall, which would end the game. So UP is not a valid move.\n\nWait, I think I'm confused about the coordinates. Let me re-examine the board and define the coordinates more clearly.\n\nLooking at the board:\n```\n0 ########\n1 #  H A #\n2 #      #\n3 #      #\n4 #      #\n5 # A    #\n6 #     A#\n7 ########\n```\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (1, 3) (row 1, column 3).\nThe apples (A) are at positions (1, 5), (5, 1), and (6, 6).\n\nNow, let's consider the moves:\n\n1. UP - Moving from (1, 3) to (0, 3) would hit the wall ('#'), which would end the game. So UP is not a valid move. But wait, this doesn't match with the given current direction of \"UP\".\n\nOk, I think I made an error in interpreting the coordinates. I was interpreting the first row with walls as the 0th row, but the board representation might be considering the wall as the boundary, not a part of the playable board.\n\nLet's re-interpret the board:\n\n```\n  01234567\n0 ########\n1 #  H A #\n2 #      #\n3 #      #\n4 #      #\n5 # A    #\n6 #     A#\n7 ########\n```\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (1, 3) (row 1, column 3).\nThe apples (A) are at positions (1, 5), (5, 1), and (6, 6).\n\nNow, let's consider the moves again:\n\n1. UP - Moving from (1, 3) to (0, 3) would hit the wall ('#') at position (0, 3), which would end the game. So UP is not a valid move.\n\nHmm, there's a discrepancy. The problem statement says \"Current direction: UP\", but moving UP would cause the snake to hit the wall, which would end the game. Let me re-read the problem statement to ensure I'm understanding it correctly.\n\nAh, I understand now. The \"Current direction: UP\" means the snake is currently moving in the UP direction, not that it's about to move in that direction. I need to decide where to move next, and it can't be DOWN (since that would be a 180-degree turn).\n\nThe snake is currently at (1, 3) and is moving in the UP direction. If it continues to move UP, it will hit the wall and lose the game.\n\nSo my options are:\n1. LEFT - Moving from (1, 3) to (1, 2), which is an empty space.\n2. RIGHT - Moving from (1, 3) to (1, 4), which is an empty space.\n\nLet's consider what happens after each move:\n1. If I move LEFT, I'll be at (1, 2). From there, I could continue moving LEFT, or turn UP or DOWN. But moving UP would hit the wall, so I'd either continue LEFT or turn DOWN.\n2. If I move RIGHT, I'll be at (1, 4). From there, I could continue moving RIGHT, or turn UP or DOWN. But moving UP would hit the wall, so I'd either continue RIGHT or turn DOWN. If I continue RIGHT, I'd be at (1, 5), which is an apple, so I'd eat it and increase my score.\n\nGiven this, moving RIGHT seems like the better choice since it leads to an apple.\n\nBut wait, let me think about this again. The snake's current direction is UP. However, it's at position (1, 3), right below the top wall. If it moves UP, it will hit the wall and lose. This doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me re-interpret the board:\n\n```\n  01234567\n0 ########\n1 #  H A #\n2 #      #\n3 #      #\n4 #      #\n5 # A    #\n6 #     A#\n7 ########\n```\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (1, 3).\nThe current direction is UP.\n\nIf the snake continues to move UP, it would go to position (0, 3), which is a wall. This would cause the game to end.\n\nI'm going to assume that the \"Current direction: UP\" means the snake is currently moving upwards, but we need to change the direction to avoid hitting the wall. So I can move either LEFT or RIGHT, not UP (because it would hit the wall) or DOWN (because it would be a 180-degree turn).\n\nGiven this, I'd choose to move RIGHT, since it leads towards an apple.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit confused about the interpretation of the \"Current direction: UP\". But assuming that's the direction the snake is currently moving, and I need to change it to avoid hitting the wall, I'd choose RIGHT.\n\nActually, wait. I think I've been misinterpreting the \"Current direction: UP\". The current direction is the direction the snake is currently moving, and I need to specify the NEXT direction.\n\nSo if the snake is currently moving UP, it can continue to move UP, or it can turn LEFT or RIGHT, but it can't turn DOWN.\n\nIf I choose to continue moving UP, the snake will hit the wall and lose the game.\nIf I choose to turn LEFT, the snake will move to an empty space.\nIf I choose to turn RIGHT, the snake will move to an empty space, and if it continues moving RIGHT in the next move, it will eat an apple.\n\nGiven this, I'd choose to turn RIGHT.\n\nOK, so to summarize: snake is at (1, 3) and is moving upwards. If it continues to move upwards, it will hit the wall and lose the game. It can't move down (since that's a 180-degree turn). So it has to move either LEFT or RIGHT. Moving RIGHT leads towards an apple, so I'd choose RIGHT.\n\nSo my final answer is: RIGHT.Game board:\n```\n########\n#  H A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nI need to analyze the current situation and make a decision about which direction to move the snake.\n\nCurrently, the snake's head (H) is at position (1,3) on the board, and it's moving UP. There are three apples (A) on the board: one at (1,5), another at (5,1), and the third at (6,6).\n\nIf the snake continues moving UP, it will hit the wall immediately and lose the game. Since the snake cannot move in the opposite direction of its current movement (so DOWN is not an option), I can only choose between LEFT and RIGHT.\n\nLooking at the board:\n- If I move LEFT, I'll just move to an empty space\n- If I move RIGHT, I'll move toward the apple at (1,5)\n\nThe strategic choice is to move RIGHT, which will position me one step away from an apple. On the next move, I can continue RIGHT to eat that apple and increase my score.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Let me analyze the game board:\n\n```\n########\n#   HA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 5\n\nThe snake is represented by 'H' (head) and there are 3 apples ('A') on the board. The snake's head is at the position next to an apple on the right side.\n\nLet me first understand the snake's current position and the surrounding elements:\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is located at the 5th column of the 2nd row.\nThere's an apple 'A' right next to the snake's head in the 6th column of the 2nd row.\n\nIf the snake keeps moving RIGHT, it will eat the apple. However, after eating the apple, it will be one step away from the wall. The snake needs to change direction to avoid hitting the wall.\n\nThe snake cannot reverse its direction, so it can't go LEFT (which would be the reverse of RIGHT). It can go either UP or DOWN.\n\nLooking at the board, there's no immediate apple above or below the snake's head. There's one apple at the bottom-left (column 2, row 6) and another at the bottom-right (column 7, row 7).\n\nSince the snake is currently moving RIGHT, and it will eat the apple in the next step, I should consider where to go after eating the apple.\n\nIf the snake continues RIGHT, it will hit the wall.\nIf the snake goes UP after eating the apple, it will move towards the top of the board, potentially making it difficult to reach the apples at the bottom.\nIf the snake goes DOWN after eating the apple, it will move towards the other apples.\n\nSo, the best direction seems to be DOWN after eating the apple. But the current question is about the immediate next move, not the move after eating the apple.\n\nGiven the current situation (snake moving RIGHT with an apple just to its right), the best move is to continue moving RIGHT to eat the apple. After eating the apple, in the next step, the snake should change direction to DOWN to avoid hitting the wall and to move towards the other apples.\n\nHmm, but if I think about it more, I'm controlling the snake now, and the current direction is RIGHT. So if I choose RIGHT, the snake will eat the apple to its right. Then in the next state, the snake will be one step away from the wall and I'll need to choose a new direction.\n\nBut if I choose DOWN now, the snake will move down without eating the apple. This seems suboptimal since the apple is right there for the taking.\n\nLet me double-check: I'm controlling the snake's movement by providing direction inputs. The snake is currently moving RIGHT, and there's an apple to its right. If I give the input 'RIGHT', the snake will continue moving right and eat the apple.\n\nSo, the best move right now is 'RIGHT'.\n\nMmm, but wait. Let me re-analyze. If the snake is currently moving RIGHT and I give the direction 'RIGHT', will the snake still move right? It seems like the direction input is the new direction for the snake to move, not a confirmation of the current direction.\n\nLet me reconsider. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction (from the general rules). The Current direction is 'RIGHT', which means the snake is currently moving right. The direction I give is the new direction for the snake to move.\n\nGiven that the snake is currently moving RIGHT, I can choose to keep it moving RIGHT (by giving the input 'RIGHT'), or I can make it turn UP or DOWN.\n\nIf I choose 'RIGHT', the snake will continue moving right and eat the apple. After eating the apple, the snake will be one step away from the wall and will need to change direction to avoid hitting the wall.\n\nIf I choose 'DOWN', the snake will turn down without eating the apple. This seems suboptimal.\n\nIf I choose 'UP', the snake will turn up without eating the apple. This also seems suboptimal.\n\nSo, the best move is 'RIGHT' to eat the apple.\n\nActually, I now realize that there is some confusion in my analysis. Let's see if I can clarify.\n\nThe game board shows the snake's head 'H' is at the 5th column of the 2nd row, with an apple 'A' to its right in the 6th column.\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT, which means the snake is currently moving to the right.\n\nIf I give the direction 'RIGHT', the snake will continue moving right and eat the apple. After eating the apple, the snake will be one step away from the wall and will need to change direction to avoid hitting the wall. But that's a concern for the next step, not for the current one.\n\nIf I give the direction 'DOWN', the snake will turn down without eating the apple.\n\nIf I give the direction 'UP', the snake will turn up without eating the apple.\n\nSo, the best move is 'RIGHT' to eat the apple.\n\nOk, so if I give the direction 'RIGHT', the next board state would be:\n\n```\n########\n#   HSA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nAfter eating the apple, I would need to choose 'DOWN' in the next step to avoid hitting the wall. However, I only need to provide one direction for the current state, not for future states. So, for now, I'm choosing 'RIGHT'.\n\nHmm, let me actually check to see if I've understood this correctly:\n\nMy understanding is:\n- The snake currently has a head (H), no body (S)\n- The snake is currently moving RIGHT\n- There's an apple (A) to the right of the head\n- If the snake eats an apple, it will grow a body segment (S) where the head was\n\nIf I choose RIGHT, the snake will move right and eat the apple, growing a segment. The new state would be:\n\n```\n########\n#   SHA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nOh, I think I've misunderstood. Let's re-read the rules.\n\nActually, wait, I need to understand how the snake is represented. The board shows 'H' for the head but no 'S' for the body. This means the snake has a length of 1, just the head. The rules say \"The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head).\"\n\nSo, if the snake eats an apple, it will grow in length. The head will move to the new position and the old position of the head will become part of the body, represented by 'S'.\n\nNow, let me re-analyze the scenario:\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at the 5th column of the 2nd row.\nThe current direction is RIGHT, which means the snake is moving to the right.\nThere's an apple 'A' to the right of the head.\n\nIf I choose 'RIGHT', the snake will continue moving right, eat the apple, and grow in length. The new state would be:\n\n```\n########\n#   SHA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. If the snake head is 'H' and the body is 'S', then the head should move in the direction I choose, and if it eats an apple, the old head position should become a body segment 'S'.\n\nLet's try again:\n\nCurrent state:\n```\n########\n#   HA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nIf I choose 'RIGHT', the snake's head will move to the right and eat the apple:\n\n```\n########\n#   SH  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nBut that doesn't match the example provided. Let me revisit the given example.\n\nOriginal state:\n```\n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nDirection: DOWN\n\nNext state:\n```\n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nAh, I see the pattern now. The snake is initially represented by a head 'H' at position (4, 3) and a body 'S' at position (2, 3). When the direction DOWN is given, the head moves down to position (4, 4) (eating an apple there), and the body 'S' stays at its position (2, 3) and a new body segment 'S' is added at the previous head position (4, 3).\n\nBut in the original state for the example, there's already a body segment 'S'. However, in the current state for the game I'm analyzing, there's only a head 'H' and no body segments.\n\nOh, I missed a part. In the rules, it's mentioned \"The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head).\" With that in mind, let me re-analyze:\n\nCurrent state:\n```\n########\n#   HA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nThe snake is currently only a head 'H' with no body segments, moving RIGHT.\n\nIf I choose 'RIGHT', the head will move right and eat the apple:\n\n```\n########\n#   SH  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nWait, actually I should be more careful about interpreting where the head went. The head was initially at the 5th column and if it eats an apple at the 6th column, I believe the next state should be:\n\n```\n########\n#   SH  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nActually, wait, let me double check with the example again.\n\nOriginal:\n```\n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nDirection: DOWN\n\nNext:\n```\n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nIn the original, the head 'H' is at position (3,4) and there's a body segment 'S' at position (3,2). The direction is DOWN, so the head moves from (3,4) to (3,5), eating an apple there. The body segment 'S' remains at (3,2), and a new body segment 'S' is added at the previous head position (3,4).\n\nSo, in the current state:\n```\n########\n#   HA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nIf I choose 'RIGHT', the head will move to the right and eat the apple:\n\n```\n########\n#   SH  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nActually, I think I'm still confused about how to interpret the board. Let's break it down more precisely:\n\nIn the original example:\n- 'H' is at position (row 4, column 3)\n- 'S' is at position (row 3, column 2)\n- 'A' is at position (row 5, column 3)\n\nAfter choosing DOWN:\n- 'H' moves to (row 5, column 3), eats the apple, and the score increases\n- 'S' remains at (row 3, column 2)\n- A new 'S' is added at the previous head position (row 4, column 3)\n\nIn the current state:\n- 'H' is at position (row 2, column 5)\n- There's an apple 'A' at position (row 2, column 6)\n\nIf I choose 'RIGHT':\n- 'H' moves to (row 2, column 6), eats the apple, and the score increases\n- A new 'S' is added at the previous head position (row 2, column 5)\n\nThe next state would be:\n```\n########\n#   SH  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nBut this doesn't match the provided example. Let me re-read the directions and ensure I'm interpreting the board correctly.\n\nHmm, let's take the provided example and analyze it more precisely:\n\nOriginal state:\n```\n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nDirection: DOWN\n\nNext state:\n```\n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nIn the original board:\n- '#' represents the walls around the edges\n- 'H' represents the snake's head\n- 'S' represents the snake's body\n- 'A' represents apples\n\nLooking at the position of 'H' in the original and the next state, it has moved from the 3rd row and 2nd column to the 4th row and 2nd column.\n\nThe position of 'S' has changed from the 2nd row and 2nd column to the 2nd and 3rd rows, both in the 2nd column. This suggests that when the snake moves, a new body segment 'S' is added at the previous position of the head, and the previous body segment(s) remain in place.\n\nAs for the apples, the one at the 4th row and 2nd column is eaten by the snake's head as it moves there, and there's a new apple at the 2nd row and 3rd column.\n\nBased on this analysis, let me correctly interpret the current state and the next state after choosing a direction.\n\nCurrent state:\n```\n########\n#   HA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at the 2nd row and 5th column. There's an apple 'A' at the 2nd row and 6th column. The current direction is RIGHT.\n\nIf I choose 'RIGHT', the snake's head will move to the 2nd row and 6th column, eating the apple there. A new body segment 'S' will be added at the previous head position (2nd row, 5th column).\n\nThe next state would be:\n```\n########\n#   SH  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nActually, wait. I'm still confused about the representation of the snake. Let me re-read the rules.\n\n\"The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'.\"\n\nThis means that initially, the snake is just the head 'H', with no body segments 'S'.\n\n\"Each time the snake eats an apple ('A'), the snake grows in length.\"\n\nThis means that when the snake eats an apple, its length increases, so it should add a body segment 'S'.\n\nLet me re-analyze the example:\n\nOriginal state:\n```\n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nIn this state, the snake consists of a head 'H' at the 3rd row and 2nd column, and a body segment 'S' at the 2nd row and 2nd column. There are apples 'A' at various positions.\n\nDirection: DOWN\n\nNext state:\n```\n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nAfter moving DOWN, the snake's head 'H' is now at the 4th row and 2nd column. The original body segment 'S' is still at the 2nd row and 2nd column, and a new body segment 'S' has been added at the previous head position (3rd row, 2nd column).\n\nThe snake has eaten an apple at the 4th row and 2nd column, which is why the head 'H' is now there.\n\nOk, now I think I understand correctly. Let me interpret the current state and the next state after choosing a direction.\n\nCurrent state:\n```\n########\n#   HA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at the 2nd row and 5th column. There are no body segments 'S', meaning the snake's length is 1. There's an apple 'A' at the 2nd row and 6th column. The current direction is RIGHT.\n\nIf I choose 'RIGHT', the snake's head will move to the 2nd row and 6th column, eating the apple there. Since the snake eats an apple, it will grow in length, adding a body segment 'S' at the previous head position (2nd row, 5th column).\n\nThe next state would be:\n```\n########\n#   SH  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nHmm, actually, there's still something off with my analysis. In the next board I'd have:\n\n```\n########\n#   SH  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nBut that means the apple was replaced by the snake's head, which isn't right. Let me reexamine the given example:\n\nOriginal state:\n```\n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nDirection: DOWN\n\nNext state:\n```\n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nIn the original state, the snake's head 'H' is at the 3rd row and 2nd column. After moving DOWN, the snake's head is at the 4th row and 2nd column, and there's an 'A' next to it, which wasn't there in the original state.\n\nWait. In the example, the new position of the head has an 'A' next to it. It seems like I may have misunderstood the dynamics. Let me review the rules again.\n\nI think there was a slight misinterpretation. The example provided shows that after the snake moves DOWN and eats an apple, it grows a body segment 'S' at the previous head position, and the head 'H' moves to the position where the apple was. There's an 'A' next to the head in the next state because the original board had two apples ('AA') in the 4th row, and the snake's head eats the one at the 4th row and 2nd column, leaving the one at the 4th row and 3rd column.\n\nSo, in the current state:\n```\n########\n#   HA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nIf I choose 'RIGHT', the snake's head will move to the 2nd row and 6th column, eating the apple there. The snake will grow a body segment 'S' at the previous head position (2nd row, 5th column).\n\nThe next state would be:\n```\n########\n#   SH  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nActually, I see where my confusion is coming from. In the original example, there are two apples ('AA') next to each other in the 4th row. After the snake moves DOWN, it eats the apple at the 4th row and 2nd column, and there's still an apple at the 4th row and 3rd column, which is now next to the snake's head.\n\nSo, the correct interpretation is:\n- The snake's head 'H' moves to the new position based on the direction\n- If the new position has an apple ('A'), the snake eats it and grows a body segment 'S' at the previous head position\n- Other apples remain in place\n\nWith this understanding, let me interpret the current state and the next state after choosing a direction.\n\nCurrent state:\n```\n########\n#   HA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at the 2nd row and 5th column. There's an apple 'A' at the 2nd row and 6th column. The current direction is RIGHT.\n\nIf I choose 'RIGHT', the snake's head will move to the 2nd row and 6th column, eating the apple there. The snake will grow a body segment 'S' at the previous head position (2nd row, 5th column).\n\nThe next state would be:\n```\n########\n#   SH  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nI want to continue moving because if I choose RIGHT, the head will move directly into the wall in the next round. The wall is represented by '#', and colliding with it would end the game. The rules state that I should avoid the wall.\n\nSince the snake's head is moving RIGHT, the snake just ate an apple and a body segment 'S' was added where it was. In the next step, I can choose to make the snake move UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT. Moving RIGHT would result in collision with the wall and end the game. So I should choose either UP or DOWN.\n\nLet's evaluate both options:\n- UP would move the snake's head to the 1st row and 6th column, which is next to the wall at the 8th column. Also, that row has walls at the edges (#), so no immediate benefit in terms of eating apples.\n- DOWN would move the snake's head to the 3rd row and 6th column, which is away from the wall and towards the center of the board. From there, the snake would have more freedom to move and could potentially reach one of the other apples.\n\nBased on this analysis, I believe the best direction to choose is RIGHT, which would result in the snake eating the apple and then having the option to move UP or DOWN in the next step to avoid the wall. Since I'm thinking ahead for the next step, I'd choose DOWN after eating the apple.\n\nHowever, for the current state, I need to choose one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP', or 'DOWN'. Since I've determined that 'RIGHT' is the best immediate move, that's my final answer.\n\nBut wait, I haven't really answered the question in full. What was the question I was supposed to address?\n\nHere's the task:\n\"- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format. The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER' (without quotes), where YOUR_ANSWER is your final answer to the question,e.g.'Answer: LEFT'\"\n\nI've analyzed the game board and rules and concluded that 'RIGHT' is the best move for the current state.\n\nSo my answer is:\n\nAnswer: RIGHT# Game Board Analysis\n\nLet me first repeat the current game board:\n\n```\n########\n#   HA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 5\n\nI can see the snake's head (H) is currently in the 2nd row, 5th column, moving RIGHT. There's an apple (A) immediately to the right of the snake's head, and two more apples on the board: one in the 6th row, 2nd column, and another in the 7th row, 7th column.\n\n# Decision\n\nLooking at the board, the most logical move is to continue moving RIGHT to eat the apple that's directly next to the snake's head. This will increase the score by 1 point and grow the snake by adding a body segment where the head currently is.\n\nIf I choose RIGHT, the snake will move to the position of the apple, eat it, and grow. The body segment will appear where the head previously was. After eating this apple, the snake would be one space away from the wall, so in the next turn, it would need to go either UP or DOWN to avoid collision.\n\nSince there's an immediate reward (the apple) by continuing RIGHT, and no danger of collision in this move, this is clearly the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Let me analyze the game board:\n\n```\n########\n#   SH #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#   A A#\n########\n```\n\nThe snake is represented by \"SH\", where \"H\" is the head and \"S\" is the body. The head of the snake is at position (5, 1) and a body segment is at position (4, 1). The snake is currently moving RIGHT.\n\nThere are three apples on the board:\n1. One apple at position (2, 5)\n2. One apple at position (4, 6)\n3. One apple at position (6, 6)\n\nI need to decide which direction to move the snake. Since the snake is currently moving RIGHT, I can choose to go UP, RIGHT, or DOWN, but not LEFT (since that would be a 180-degree turn, which is not allowed).\n\nIf I go RIGHT, the snake's head will hit the wall, which would end the game. So RIGHT is not a valid option.\n\nIf I go UP, the snake's head will move to position (5, 0), which is a wall, so that would also end the game. So UP is not a valid option.\n\nIf I go DOWN, the snake's head will move to position (5, 2), which is an empty space. This is a valid move.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN. This will allow the snake to continue moving without hitting a wall or itself, and potentially get closer to an apple.\n\nSo my answer is DOWN.Game board:\n########\n#   SH #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#   A A#\n########\n\nLooking at the current game board:\n- The snake's head (H) is at the right side of the first row, with one body segment (S) to its left\n- The snake is currently moving RIGHT\n- There are three apples (A) on the board: one at the left of the fifth row, and two at the bottom row\n\nGiven the current direction is RIGHT, I have three possible moves:\n1. Continue RIGHT - This would crash the snake into the wall, ending the game\n2. Turn UP - This would crash the snake into the wall, ending the game\n3. Turn DOWN - This would allow the snake to continue moving safely\n\nSince moving RIGHT or UP would result in immediate collision with the wall, the only valid move is DOWN. This will keep the snake alive and eventually allow it to move toward the apples.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Let me understand the situation:\n\n1. The snake's head is at position 'H', which is at coordinates (5, 4) (counting from the top left, 0-indexed).\n2. The snake's body is at position 'S', which is at coordinates (5, 3).\n3. There are 3 apples ('A') on the board: at coordinates (1, 6), (3, 6), and (5, 6).\n4. The current direction is DOWN.\n5. The current epoch is 7.\n\nI need to control the snake to eat apples without crashing into walls or itself.\n\nThe snake is moving DOWN (towards the bottom of the board). If I continue moving DOWN, the snake will approach the apple at position (1, 6). However, I need to move either LEFT or RIGHT to reach it. \n\nGiven that I can't reverse direction directly (since the snake is moving DOWN, I can't immediately move UP), my options are to go either LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nSince there's an apple to the left at position (1, 6), it makes sense to turn LEFT. This way, the snake will move towards an apple and have the potential to eat it in the upcoming turns.\n\nActually, let me double-check the positions. Let's number the rows and columns, starting from 0 at the top-left:\n\n```\n   01234567\n  --------\n0 |########\n1 |#    S #\n2 |#    H #\n3 |#      #\n4 |#      #\n5 |# A    #\n6 |#   A A#\n7 |########\n```\n\nAh, I see. The snake's head is at (2, 5) (row 2, column 5) and the body segment is at (1, 5). The current direction is DOWN.\n\nThe apples are at positions (5, 1), (6, 3), and (6, 5).\n\nIf I continue moving DOWN, the snake will approach the apples at the bottom of the board. The closest one is at position (5, 1), but I would need to move LEFT to reach it.\n\nLooking ahead, if I move DOWN, the snake's head will be at (3, 5) and the body segment will follow behind. I can continue moving DOWN to approach the apple at (6, 5).\n\nActually, let me clarify the coordinates to make sure I understand the board correctly. In the board representation, rows are counted from the top and columns from the left, both starting from 0. So, the position (row, column) of each element is:\n\n```\n   01234567\n  --------\n0 |########\n1 |#    S # - Snake body at (1, 5)\n2 |#    H # - Snake head at (2, 5)\n3 |#      #\n4 |#      #\n5 |# A    # - Apple at (5, 1)\n6 |#   A A# - Apples at (6, 3) and (6, 5)\n7 |########\n```\n\nHmm, let me double check if I'm looking at this correctly. The snake's head (H) is on the third row from top (row 2) and the sixth column from left (column 5). The snake's body (S) is on the second row from top (row 1) and the sixth column from left (column 5).\n\nWait, that can't be right. If the snake is moving DOWN, then the body should be above the head. Let me re-read the board:\n\n```\n########\n#    S #\n#    H #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#   A A#\n########\n```\n\nGiven that the snake is moving DOWN, I would expect the body (S) to be directly above the head (H). Indeed, the body is at row 1, column 5, and the head is at row 2, column 5. \n\nNow, let's assess the apples:\n- One apple is at row 5, column 1.\n- One apple is at row 6, column 3.\n- One apple is at row 6, column 5.\n\nThe current direction is DOWN. If I continue moving DOWN, the snake's head will be at (3, 5) in the next step. Eventually, if I keep moving DOWN, the snake can directly reach the apple at (6, 5).\n\nBut it might be strategic to move LEFT at some point to reach the apple at (5, 1) or (6, 3). Since I can only move one step at a time and can't reverse direction directly, I'll need to plan my path.\n\nFor now, I think continuing to move DOWN is a good strategy. This will bring the snake closer to the apples at the bottom of the board, and I can adjust the direction as needed in subsequent turns.\n\nSo, my answer is to continue moving DOWN.\n\nActually, let me rethink this a bit more systematically. When doing pathfinding on a grid, I should think about the taxicab distance (Manhattan distance) to the apples. Given the current position of the snake and the constraints of movement, which path minimizes the steps to reach an apple?\n\nLet's think about this step by step:\n\nFrom position (2, 5), the distance to each apple is:\n- Apple at (5, 1): |5 - 2| + |1 - 5| = 3 + 4 = 7 steps.\n- Apple at (6, 3): |6 - 2| + |3 - 5| = 4 + 2 = 6 steps.\n- Apple at (6, 5): |6 - 2| + |5 - 5| = 4 + 0 = 4 steps.\n\nThe closest apple is at (6, 5), which is directly below the snake. It would take 4 steps to reach it by continuing to move DOWN.\n\nSo, moving DOWN brings me closer to the closest apple. It's the optimal move in this situation.\n\nI confirm my answer: I will move the snake DOWN.\n\nWait, let me check again. If I move DOWN, the next position will be:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#    S #\n#    H #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#   A A#\n########\n```\n\nActually, the snake's body isn't at (1, 5) but at (1, 6). It's S followed by a space. So the positions are:\n\n- Snake's body (S): (1, 5)\n- Snake's head (H): (2, 5)\n\nThat doesn't change my decision, though. The snake is still moving DOWN, and I want to continue in that direction to approach the apple at (6, 5).\n\nSo, my final answer is to move the snake DOWN.\n\nActually, wait, let me be super clear on this. The board you provided is:\n\n```\n########\n#    S #\n#    H #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#   A A#\n########\n```\n\nCounting from 0, this means:\n\n- The wall (`#`) is at the borders.\n- The snake's body (`S`) is at position (1, 5).\n- The snake's head (`H`) is at position (2, 5).\n- Apples (`A`) are at positions (5, 1), (6, 3), and (6, 5).\n\nThe direction of the snake is DOWN, which means the head would move to (3, 5) in the next step.\n\nChecking again, the snake's body and head are aligned in column 5. Since the body (`S`) is at position (1, 5) and the head (`H`) is directly below at position (2, 5), it confirms that the snake is indeed moving DOWN.\n\nThe closest apple is at (6, 5), which is directly below the snake's head in the same column. To reach this apple, the snake should continue moving DOWN.\n\nSo, I confirm my answer: The snake should move DOWN.\n\nActually, wait, the very first thing I should do is to repeat the current game board.\n\nGiven the game board:\n```\n########\n#    S #\n#    H #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#   A A#\n########\n```\n\nand the current direction being DOWN.\n\nMy answer is to move the snake DOWN.Game board:\n```\n########\n#    S #\n#    H #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#   A A#\n########\n```\n\nLooking at the current game board, I can see that:\n- The snake's head (H) is at position (2,5)\n- The snake's body segment (S) is at position (1,5)\n- There are three apples: at (5,1), (6,3), and (6,5)\n- The snake is currently moving DOWN\n\nSince the snake's current direction is DOWN, I need to decide whether to continue moving DOWN or turn LEFT or RIGHT (I cannot move UP as that would be reversing direction).\n\nThe closest apple is at (6,5), which is directly below the snake's head in the same column. If I continue moving DOWN, I'll be able to reach this apple in the quickest way possible.\n\nTherefore, I should continue moving DOWN. This will keep the snake on track to reach the apple at the bottom of the board in column 5.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Let me analyze the game board first:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#    S #\n#    H #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#   A A#\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (3, 5) (row 3, column 5), if we use 0-indexed positions and start from the top-left.\nThe snake's body (S) is at position (2, 5) (row 2, column 5).\nThe apples (A) are at positions (5, 2), (6, 4), and (6, 6).\n\nThe current direction is DOWN, which means the snake is moving downward.\n\nI need to decide the next direction for the snake. Let's consider my options:\n\n1. Continue moving DOWN: This would move the snake's head to position (4, 5). This position is empty, so the snake can move there safely. But it's not an apple, so the snake won't grow.\n\n2. Turn LEFT: This would move the snake's head to position (3, 4). This position is empty, so the snake can move there safely. But it's not an apple, so the snake won't grow.\n\n3. Turn RIGHT: This would move the snake's head to position (3, 6). This position is empty, so the snake can move there safely. But it's not an apple, so the snake won't grow.\n\n4. Turn UP: The snake can't turn UP because it's currently moving DOWN, and the snake cannot reverse its direction.\n\nSince none of the three possible directions lead directly to an apple, I need to choose a direction that gets the snake closer to an apple. The closest apple is at position (5, 2), which is to the left and down from the snake's head. \n\nIf I move the snake LEFT, it will get closer to the leftmost apple. If I move it DOWN, it will get closer to the leftmost and middle apples. If I move it RIGHT, it will get closer to the rightmost apple.\n\nGiven that there are two apples to the bottom of the snake, I think it makes more sense to continue moving DOWN, and then we can decide in the next step whether to go LEFT or RIGHT to reach one of the apples.\n\nSo, my decision is to continue moving DOWN.\n\nActually, let me double-check my analysis. The board is 8x8 with walls represented by '#' around the edges. So the actual playable area is 6x6, and the positions I've been referring to are 1-indexed, with (1, 1) being the top-left position inside the walls.\n\nGiven that:\n- The snake's head (H) is at position (4, 6) (row 4, column 6).\n- The snake's body (S) is at position (3, 6) (row 3, column 6).\n- The apples (A) are at positions (6, 3), (7, 5), and (7, 7).\n\nActually, let me be more precise about how I'm indexing positions. The top-left corner of the board is (0, 0). The walls occupy positions where either the row or column index is 0 or 7. The playable area is from positions (1, 1) to (6, 6).\n\nWith this convention:\n- The snake's head (H) is at position (3, 5) (row 3, column 5).\n- The snake's body (S) is at position (2, 5) (row 2, column 5).\n- The apples (A) are at positions (5, 2), (6, 4), and (6, 6).\n\nNow, let's reconsider the options:\n\n1. Continue moving DOWN: This would move the snake's head to position (4, 5). This position is empty, so the snake can move there safely. This moves the snake closer to the two apples at the bottom of the board.\n\n2. Turn LEFT: This would move the snake's head to position (3, 4). This position is empty, so the snake can move there safely. This doesn't immediately lead to an apple, but it gets the snake closer to the leftmost apple.\n\n3. Turn RIGHT: This would move the snake's head to position (3, 6). This position is empty, so the snake can move there safely. This doesn't immediately lead to an apple, but it gets the snake closer to the rightmost apple.\n\n4. Turn UP: The snake can't turn UP because it's currently moving DOWN, and the snake cannot reverse its direction.\n\nConsidering the positions of the apples, I think the best strategy is to continue moving DOWN, and then in the next steps, decide whether to go LEFT or RIGHT to reach one of the apples at the bottom of the board.\n\nSo, my decision remains to continue moving DOWN.\n\nWait, I need to re-read the problem statement to make sure I understand the indexing correctly. The problem states that the board is 8x8, with walls represented by '#' around the edges. So the playable area is 6x6. And I note the coordinates start from the top-left corner of the board.\n\nUsing this convention, and looking at the board again:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#    S #\n#    H #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#   A A#\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (3, 5) (row 3, column 5), with (0, 0) being the top-left corner of the board.\nThe snake's body (S) is at position (2, 5) (row 2, column 5).\nThe apples (A) are at positions (5, 2), (6, 4), and (6, 6).\n\nNow, let's reconsider the options:\n\n1. Continue moving DOWN: The snake's head would move to position (4, 5), which is a valid move.\n2. Turn LEFT: The snake's head would move to position (3, 4), which is a valid move.\n3. Turn RIGHT: The snake's head would move to position (3, 6), which is a valid move.\n4. Turn UP: This is not a valid move because the snake can't reverse direction.\n\nNow, considering the positions of the apples, the best direction for the snake to move is DOWN, as this gets the snake closer to the two apples in the bottom rows. After moving DOWN, the snake can then decide whether to go LEFT or RIGHT to reach one of the apples.\n\nSo, again my decision is to move DOWN.\n\nActually, there's a second aspect of the problem: I need to predict what the board will look like after the action. If I move DOWN, the snake's head will be at (4, 5), and as there's no apple at this position, the snake's length remains the same. So the tail will move to (3, 5), and the head will be at (4, 5). The board would look like:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    S #\n#    H #\n# A    #\n#   A A#\n########\n```\n\nBut wait, that's not right. Let me re-read the problem:\n\n\"Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length.\"\n\nThis means the snake's body length increases by 1 when it eats an apple. In this move, the snake is not eating an apple, so its length remains the same. So the correct board after moving DOWN would be:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    S #\n#    H #\n# A    #\n#   A A#\n########\n```\n\nActually, lets be clear about how the snake moves. The snake's head moves to a new position, and the rest of the body follows. If the snake eats an apple, the snake grows in length, which means the tail doesn't move. If the snake doesn't eat an apple, the tail moves to the position of the second-to-last body segment.\n\nIn our case, the snake's head is at (3, 5) and the body is at (2, 5). If the snake moves DOWN to (4, 5), the head will be at (4, 5) and the body will be at (3, 5). So the board would be:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    S #\n#    H #\n# A    #\n#   A A#\n########\n```\n\nActually I might be making a mistake here. Let me try again. We currently have:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#    S #\n#    H #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#   A A#\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (row=3, column=5). It's going DOWN.\nThe snake's body\/tail (S) is at position (row=2, column=5).\n\nIf the snake moves DOWN, the head will move to (row=4, column=5), and the body segment will move to where the head was, which is (row=3, column=5).\n\nSo, the new board would be:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    S #\n#    H #\n# A    #\n#   A A#\n########\n```\n\nIf the snake eats an apple in this next move, then the body segment wouldn't move, and a new segment would be created at the position of the head. But there's no apple at the head's next position based on my preferred action (DOWN), so the snake doesn't grow.\n\nSo after moving DOWN, the board would be:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    S #\n#    H #\n# A    #\n#   A A#\n########\n```\n\nOK so to confirm, my decision is to move DOWN.\n\nSo my final answer is: DOWNI'll analyze the current game board:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#    S #\n#    H #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#   A A#\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (3, 5), and its body (S) is at position (2, 5). The snake is currently moving DOWN.\n\nThe three apples (A) are located at:\n- (5, 2) - left side\n- (6, 4) - bottom middle\n- (6, 6) - bottom right\n\nLet me consider my options:\n1. Continue moving DOWN: This would move the snake's head to (4, 5), which is empty and safe.\n2. Turn LEFT: This would move the snake's head to (3, 4), which is empty and safe.\n3. Turn RIGHT: This would move the snake's head to (3, 6), which is empty and safe.\n4. Turn UP: Not valid since the snake cannot reverse direction.\n\nSince there are two apples in the bottom row, continuing to move DOWN is the best strategy. This will get the snake closer to the apples, and then I can decide whether to turn left or right to reach one of them.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Let me analyze the current game board state and determine the best move.\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    S #\n#    H #\n# A    #\n#   A A#\n########\n```\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4, 5) (counting from the top-left, 0-indexed), and it has one body segment (S) above it at (4, 3). The current direction is DOWN.\n\nThere are three apples (A):\n- One at approximately (1, 5)\n- One at approximately (3, 6)\n- One at approximately (5, 6)\n\nSince the snake is currently moving DOWN, I need to decide the next move. I cannot choose UP because that would be a reversal of direction (and collide with the body). My options are:\n- Continue DOWN\n- Turn LEFT\n- Turn RIGHT\n\nIf I go DOWN, I'll be moving closer to the apples in the bottom row, but not directly to one.\nIf I go LEFT, I'll be moving toward the apple at (1, 5).\nIf I go RIGHT, I'll be moving closer to the apples on the right side.\n\nGiven that there's an apple directly on the left side a few steps away, and I'm currently not heading directly to any apple, I think turning LEFT would be the best move. This will allow me to navigate toward that apple.\n\nSo my answer will be LEFT.\n\nActually, let me double-check my understanding of the grid coordinates for the game pieces:\n\nAssuming 0-indexed positions from the top left:\n\nThe head (H) is at (4, 5).\nThe body (S) is at (4, 3).\nThe apples (A) are at (1, 5), (3, 6), and (5, 6).\n\nWait, let me reassess this. I should count from row 0 and column 0 as the top-left, where the first # is.\n\nSo looking at the grid again, the walls # form the boundary at positions (0,0) through (7,7). So the inside of the grid is positions (1,1) through (6,6).\n\nI need to be more precise:\n\n```\n01234567 (column indices)\n0########\n1#      #\n2#      #\n3#    S #\n4#    H #\n5# A    #\n6#   A A#\n7########\n```\n(row indices on the left)\n\nSo:\n- The head (H) is at row 4, column 5\n- The body (S) is at row 3, column 5\n- The apples (A) are at:\n  - (5, 1) - top left apple\n  - (6, 3) - bottom middle apple\n  - (6, 5) - bottom right apple\n\nThe current direction is DOWN. If I go:\n- LEFT: I'll move toward the apple at (5, 1)\n- RIGHT: I won't immediately find an apple\n- DOWN: I'll move toward the apples at the bottom but not directly to one\n\nIt seems that turning LEFT is still the best option as it puts me on a direct path to one of the apples.\n\nSo my answer remains LEFT.\n\nActually, let me be completely sure I understand the layout:\n\n```\n   01234567\n  0########\n  1#      #\n  2#      #\n  3#    S #\n  4#    H #\n  5# A    #\n  6#   A A#\n  7########\n```\n\n- Head (H): (4, 5) - row 4, column 5\n- Body (S): (3, 5) - row 3, column 5\n- Apple 1 (A): (5, 2) - row 5, column 2\n- Apple 2 (A): (6, 4) - row 6, column 4\n- Apple 3 (A): (6, 6) - row 6, column 6\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. \n\nIf I go LEFT, I'll be at (4, 4) in the next move.\nIf I go RIGHT, I'll be at (4, 6) in the next move.\nIf I go DOWN, I'll be at (5, 5) in the next move.\n\nI think turning LEFT still looks like a good option because it gives me flexibility to navigate towards the apple at (5, 2). If I continue DOWN, I might reach the bottom edge before I can effectively navigate to any of the apples.\n\nHowever, going RIGHT would also bring me closer to the apple at (6, 6). \n\nGiven the current state and the fact that I'm already moving DOWN, continuing DOWN might also be reasonable, as it would bring me closer to both apples at (6, 4) and (6, 6), giving me options in future moves.\n\nAfter considering all options, I think going LEFT is the best choice because it gives me a clear path to at least one apple, and it reduces the risk of getting trapped against the bottom edge.\n\nSo my final answer is LEFT.\n\nActually, one more thing to check. If I go LEFT, I'll be at (4, 4) in the next step. Then to get to the apple at (5, 2), I would need to go DOWN and then continue LEFT for multiple steps. That means I need to be prepared to navigate around the left part of the grid.\n\nIf I go DOWN, I'll be at (5, 5) in the next step. Then I could go either LEFT towards the apple at (5, 2) or continue DOWN and then go LEFT or RIGHT to target the apples at (6, 4) or (6, 6).\n\nIf I go RIGHT, I'll be at (4, 6) in the next step. Then I could continue RIGHT or go DOWN to target the apple at (6, 6).\n\nAfter this additional consideration, I think the choice depends on the strategy:\n- If I want to maximize immediate flexibility, going DOWN is good because it keeps options open for accessing all three apples.\n- If I want to directly target a single apple, going LEFT is good for the apple at (5, 2), and going RIGHT followed by DOWN is good for the apple at (6, 6).\n\nGiven that the snake is still very short (just head + one body segment), I'm going to prioritize flexibility and recommend going DOWN, which will allow me to assess which apple to target in the next move.\n\nActually, I need to reconsider the rows and columns one more time. Let's be precise about 0-indexing:\n\n```\n   01234567\n  0########\n  1#      #\n  2#      #\n  3#    S #\n  4#    H #\n  5# A    #\n  6#   A A#\n  7########\n```\n\nSnake:\n- Head (H): row 4, column 5\n- Body (S): row 3, column 5\n\nApples:\n- Apple 1 (A): row 5, column 2\n- Apple 2 (A): row 6, column 4\n- Apple 3 (A): row 6, column 6\n\nWe're currently moving DOWN.\n\nLet's analyze each possible move and where it eventually leads us (thinking multiple moves ahead):\n\nDOWN:\n- Next position: (5, 5) - Not an apple\n- Can then go LEFT or RIGHT\n- LEFT will lead me closer to the apple at (5, 2)\n- RIGHT will lead me closer to the apples at (6, 4) and (6, 6)\n\nLEFT:\n- Next position: (4, 4) - Not an apple\n- Can then go DOWN\n- After going DOWN, I'd be at (5, 4) which is not an apple but closer to the apple at (6, 4)\n\nRIGHT:\n- Next position: (4, 6) - Not an apple\n- Can then go DOWN\n- After going DOWN, I'd be at (5, 6) which is not an apple but closer to the apple at (6, 6)\n\nAfter considering the paths further, I think continuing DOWN provides the most flexibility and is the best choice. After moving DOWN, I can assess which apple to target based on the state of the game.\n\nSo my final answer is DOWN.\n\nActually, I'm second guessing myself and need to verify the row\/column of the head and body are correct using the visual:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    S #\n#    H #\n# A    #\n#   A A#\n########\n```\n\nLet's count carefully:\n\nRow 0: ########\nRow 1: #      #\nRow 2: #      #\nRow 3: #    S #\nRow 4: #    H #\nRow 5: # A    #\nRow 6: #   A A#\nRow 7: ########\n\nColumn 0: #######\nColumn 1: #      \nColumn 2: #      \nColumn 3: #      \nColumn 4: #      \nColumn 5: #SS   A\nColumn 6: #     A\nColumn 7: #######\n\nGiven this, the positions are:\n- Head (H): row 4, column 5\n- Body (S): row 3, column 5\n- Apple 1 (A): row 5, column 2\n- Apple 2 (A): row 6, column 4\n- Apple 3 (A): row 6, column 6\n\nI think I was correct in my analysis before. Given these positions, we're currently moving DOWN.\n\nLet's reconsider the options:\n- DOWN: Leads to (5, 5), which is not an apple. But then I can choose to go LEFT or RIGHT.\n- LEFT: Leads to (4, 4), which is not an apple. I would need to go further to approach any apple.\n- RIGHT: Leads to (4, 6), which is not an apple. I would need to go further to approach any apple.\n\nI think continuing DOWN is the most strategic, as it keeps my options open and brings me closer to the center of the grid where more apples are located.\n\nSo my final answer is DOWN.\n\nWait, I left out something important. Let me go back to the grid and check where the snake's body (S) is, because I need to ensure I don't collide with it:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    S #\n#    H #\n# A    #\n#   A A#\n########\n```\n\nThe head (H) is at (4, 5) and the body segment (S) is at (3, 5).\n\nIf I continue moving DOWN, the head will move to (5, 5) and the body segment will follow to the previous position of the head, which is (4, 5). This is a valid move.\n\nIf I were to move UP, the head would move to (3, 5), which is currently occupied by the body segment (S). This would lead to a collision, so UP is not a valid move. But the rules already specify that I can't reverse direction directly anyway.\n\nIf I move LEFT, the head will be at (4, 4) and the body will move to (4, 5), which is the previous position of the head. This is valid.\n\nIf I move RIGHT, the head will be at (4, 6) and the body will move to (4, 5), which is the previous position of the head. This is also valid.\n\nSo, in summary, I have three valid moves: DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\nNow, considering the positions of the apples and the goal of the game (to eat as many apples as possible), I believe the best move is to continue moving DOWN. This will position me better to navigate toward the apples in the future turns.\n\nSo my final answer is DOWN.\n\nActually, let me just do a quick visual check of the game board with each of these three moves to make sure I'm reading this correctly:\n\nCurrent board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    S #\n#    H #\n# A    #\n#   A A#\n########\n```\n\nIf I go DOWN:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    S #\n# A  H #\n#   A A#\n########\n```\n\nIf I go LEFT:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   HS #\n# A    #\n#   A A#\n########\n```\n\nIf I go RIGHT:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    SH #\n# A    #\n#   A A#\n########\n```\n\nI think these look correct based on my understanding.\n\nNow, evaluating the strategic value of each move:\n\n- DOWN: Positions me closer to the apple at (5, 2) and gives me flexibility to choose a direction to approach the other apples in the next move.\n\n- LEFT: Takes me away from the right side of the grid where two apples are located.\n\n- RIGHT: Takes me closer to the right side where two apples are located, but I'd still need to navigate down to reach them.\n\nI'm leaning toward DOWN as the most strategic move, as it positions me better for future moves and keeps my options open.\n\nSo my final answer is DOWN.\n\nActually, let me do a bit more analysis on what my optimal strategy is for reaching the apples.\n\n1. If I go DOWN, I'll be at (5, 5). From there:\n   - To reach the apple at (5, 2), I need to go LEFT 3 times.\n   - To reach the apple at (6, 4), I need to go DOWN once and then LEFT once.\n   - To reach the apple at (6, 6), I need to go DOWN once and then RIGHT once.\n\n2. If I go LEFT, I'll be at (4, 4). From there:\n   - To reach the apple at (5, 2), I need to go DOWN once and then LEFT 2 times.\n   - To reach the apple at (6, 4), I need to go DOWN 2 times.\n   - To reach the apple at (6, 6), I need to go DOWN 2 times and then RIGHT 2 times.\n\n3. If I go RIGHT, I'll be at (4, 6). From there:\n   - To reach the apple at (5, 2), I need to go DOWN once and then LEFT 4 times.\n   - To reach the apple at (6, 4), I need to go DOWN 2 times and then LEFT 2 times.\n   - To reach the apple at (6, 6), I need to go DOWN 2 times.\n\nBased on this comparison, going DOWN gives me the most direct paths to all three apples. I can either go LEFT 3 times to reach the apple at (5, 2), or go DOWN and then choose to go LEFT or RIGHT to reach the apples at (6, 4) or (6, 6), respectively.\n\nThis confirms my decision to go DOWN as the most strategic move.\n\nSo my final answer is DOWN.\n\nAcutally, let me reanalyze carefully what happens in the next step. If the next move is DOWN, the snake's head will move from (4, 5) to (5, 5), and the body segment will move from (3, 5) to (4, 5).\n\nAfter this move, the game board will look like this:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    S #\n# A  H #\n#   A A#\n########\n```\n\nFrom this position:\n- The apple at (5, 2) is 3 steps to the left.\n- The apple at (6, 4) is 1 step down and 1 step left.\n- The apple at (6, 6) is 1 step down and 1 step right.\n\nI think my optimal strategy would be to go DOWN, then assess whether to go LEFT or RIGHT based on future moves. This is flexible and gives me options to navigate to any of the three apples. Since DOWN is my current direction, I can just continue in that direction.\n\nSo my final answer is DOWN.\n\nActually, one more analysis for completeness.\n\nCurrent board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    S #\n#    H #\n# A    #\n#   A A#\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nIf I go DOWN, I'll be at (5, 5). Looking at the future state of the board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    S #\n# A  H #\n#   A A#\n########\n```\n\nFrom here, I could go LEFT or RIGHT in the next move.\n\nIf I go LEFT in this next move, I'll be at (5, 4), which is one step closer to the apple at (5, 2).\n\nIf I go RIGHT in this next move, I'll be at (5, 6), which is one step closer to the apple at (6, 6).\n\nGoing DOWN as the next move allows me to keep my options open and positions me better for future strategic decisions.\n\nSo my final answer is DOWN.I'll analyze the game board first:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    S #\n#    H #\n# A    #\n#   A A#\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 9\n\nIn this board:\n- The snake's head (H) is at row 4, column 5\n- There's one body segment (S) at row 3, column 5\n- There are three apples: one at row 5, column 2 (left side), and two at the bottom row (row 6) at columns 4 and 6\n\nSince I'm currently moving DOWN, I need to decide whether to continue in that direction or turn LEFT or RIGHT. I cannot go UP as that would reverse direction and cause a collision with my body.\n\nIf I continue moving DOWN, I'll be at position (5,5), which puts me in a good central position to then decide whether to go for the apple on the left or continue down toward the bottom apples.\n\nGoing DOWN is the most strategic move as it:\n1. Continues my current direction\n2. Positions me closer to all apples\n3. Gives me flexibility for my next move\n\nAnswer: DOWN","HTTPError 529: {\"error\":{\"message\":\"-4316: Overloaded\",\"code\":\"-4307\"}}"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head).

The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls.
