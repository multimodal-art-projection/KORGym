The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). The goal is to move toward apples to increase the score. \n\nThe closest apple is at row 1, column 3 (since row 1 has \"A A   #\", with apples at columns 1 and 3). Moving UP from the current position (row 4, column 3) will take the snake through row 3, column 3 → row 2, column 3 → row 1, column 3, where it will reach the apple at row 1, column 3 in subsequent moves. \n\nChoosing UP maintains the direction toward this apple, making it the optimal choice. Other directions (LEFT\/RIGHT) would move the snake away from this apple or delay reaching it.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#A A   #\n#     A#\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at position (3, 3) (row 3, column 3, 0-indexed).\n- Current direction is UP; reversing (DOWN) is invalid. Valid directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n- Apples ('A') are at (1, 1), (1, 3), and (2, 5).\n\n### Analysis of possible directions:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP from (3, 3) takes the head to (2, 3). This position is empty (no collision). From (2, 3), the next move (if direction remains UP) would reach (1, 3), which contains an apple. This path allows the snake to eat an apple in the next epoch.\n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (3, 3) takes the head to (3, 2). This position is empty, but the nearest apple (1, 1) is further away (requires multiple steps up and left).\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (3, 3) takes the head to (3, 4). This position is empty, but the nearest apple (2, 5) is also further away (requires a right move followed by an up move).\n\nThe shortest path to an apple is via continuing UP, as it directly leads toward the apple at (1, 3) in the next move. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#A A   #\n#  H  A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe current direction is UP, and the snake's head is at (row 2, column 3). The snake cannot reverse direction, so possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- Moving UP: The next head position is (row 1, column 3), which contains an 'A' (apple). This would result in eating the apple, increasing the score, and growing the snake. The position is within the board (not a wall) and no self-collision occurs.\n- Moving LEFT: The next head position is (row 2, column 2), which is empty (' '). No apple is eaten.\n- Moving RIGHT: The next head position is (row 2, column 4), which is empty (' '). No apple is eaten.\n\nMoving UP is the optimal choice as it allows the snake to eat an apple and grow. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A H A #\n#  S  A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (row 1, column 3), and the body ('S') is at (row 2, column 3). The current direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse to DOWN. \n\n### Analysis of possible directions:\n- **UP**: Moving UP from row 1 would take the head to row 0, which is a wall (collision). Invalid.  \n- **DOWN**: Reversing direction from UP to DOWN is not allowed. Invalid.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from column 3 to column 2 (row 1, column 2) lands on an empty space. No collision with walls or the snake's body. Safe.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from column 3 to column 4 (row 1, column 4) lands on an empty space. No collision with walls or the snake's body. Safe.  \n\n### Strategy:\nBoth LEFT and RIGHT are safe. However, moving LEFT positions the snake closer to the apple at (row 1, column 1) (two moves away: LEFT to (1,2) then LEFT again to (1,1), which is an apple). This path avoids walls and self-collision, allowing the snake to eat an apple in the next move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#AHS A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and collision risks:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: Head (H) is at (row 1, column 2); Body (S) is at (row 1, column 3).\n- **Current Direction**: LEFT (snake cannot reverse to RIGHT).\n- **Apples**: 3 apples are present at (1,1), (1,5), and (2,6).\n- **Walls**: Edge rows (0 and 7) and columns (0 and 7) are walls (`#`).\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **LEFT** (current direction, allowed):  \n   Moving LEFT from (1,2) takes the head to (1,1), which contains an apple (`A`). Eating this apple will grow the snake (length increases by 1) and increase the score by 1. No collision (wall or self) occurs here.  \n\n2. **UP**:  \n   Moving UP from (1,2) takes the head to (0,2), which is a wall (`#`). This causes an immediate collision and game over.  \n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   Moving DOWN from (1,2) takes the head to (2,2), an empty space. No apple is eaten, and no collision occurs, but the snake does not gain length or score.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nChoosing **LEFT** allows the snake to safely eat an apple, grow, and increase the score. Other directions either cause collisions (UP) or no score gain (DOWN).  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#HSS A #\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe current direction is LEFT, and the snake's head is at (row 1, column 1). The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). Checking possible directions:\n\n- **LEFT**: The next head position would be (row 1, column 0), which is a wall (collision, game over).  \n- **UP**: The next head position would be (row 0, column 1), which is a wall (collision, game over).  \n- **DOWN**: The next head position is (row 2, column 1), which is a safe empty space (no walls or body collision).  \n\nThus, the only valid direction to avoid immediate collision is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SS  A #\n#H A  A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. The snake's head is at (2,1) (row 2, column 1). The snake's body segments are at (1,1) and (1,2). The snake cannot reverse direction (so UP is invalid). Possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **LEFT**: Moving left would take the head to (2,0), which is a wall (column 0 is a wall). Collision with the wall, game over. Invalid.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving right takes the head to (2,2). This position is empty (no wall or body). Safe. This brings the head closer to the apple at (2,3) (two steps right from current head).  \n- **DOWN**: Moving down takes the head to (3,1). This position is empty (safe) but moves the head away from the nearest apples in row 2.  \n\nChoosing RIGHT allows the snake to approach the apple at (2,3) in the next move, which is optimal for eating apples. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#S   A #\n#SHA  A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, we analyze the snake's position, current direction (RIGHT), and possible moves. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). We evaluate UP, DOWN, and RIGHT:\n\n- **RIGHT**: The snake's head (at row 2, column 2) moves to row 2, column 3. This position contains an 'A' (apple). Eating the apple increases the score by 1, and the snake grows. The new head position is valid (no wall or self-collision).  \n- **UP**: The head moves to row 1, column 2 (empty space). No apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow.  \n- **DOWN**: The head moves to row 3, column 2 (empty space). No apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow.  \n\nMoving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple safely, making it the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#S   A #\n#SSH  A#\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: Head (H) is at (2,3) (row 2, column 3). Body segments (S) are at (2,2), (2,1), and (1,1).\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid).\n- **Apples**: Located at (1,5), (2,6), and (3,4).\n- **Goal**: Move toward the nearest apple while avoiding collisions with walls or the snake's body.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Moves:\n1. **RIGHT**: Next head position is (2,4). This is a safe, empty space but does not contain an apple. The snake would need 3 more RIGHT moves to reach the apple at (2,6).\n2. **UP**: Next head position is (1,3). This is a safe, empty space but does not contain an apple. The snake would need 3 more moves (UP then RIGHT) to reach the apple at (1,5).\n3. **DOWN**: Next head position is (3,3). This is a safe, empty space. From (3,3), the snake can move RIGHT to (3,4) in the next epoch, directly reaching the apple at (3,4) (only 2 total moves).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN allows the snake to reach the nearest apple (at (3,4)) in 2 moves, which is more efficient than other directions.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#    A #\n#SSS  A#\n#  H A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (y=3, x=2) (assuming rows as y and columns as x, with (0,0) at the top-left corner). The current direction is DOWN, and the snake cannot reverse to UP. Possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN. \n\n- **Moving DOWN**: The head would move to (y=4, x=2), which is a safe empty space but not an apple.  \n- **Moving LEFT**: The head would move to (y=3, x=1), a safe empty space. However, the next move (epoch 11) could lead to a wall collision (x=0) if continuing LEFT, making this risky.  \n- **Moving RIGHT**: The head moves to (y=3, x=3), a safe empty space. The next move (epoch 11) with direction RIGHT would reach (y=3, x=4), where an apple ('A') is located. This allows the snake to eat the apple and grow.  \n\nChoosing RIGHT is optimal as it positions the snake to reach an apple in the next epoch. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#    A #\n# SS  A#\n#  SHA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (3,3) (row 3, column 3). The current direction is RIGHT, so the snake cannot reverse to LEFT. Possible directions are RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. \n\n- **Moving RIGHT**: The head moves to (3,4), which contains an apple ('A'). This is safe (no wall or self-collision), and the snake will eat the apple, increasing the score by 1 and growing in length.  \n- **Moving UP**: The head moves to (2,3), which is empty. No apple is eaten, and the snake's tail (current (2,1)) would shrink, keeping length unchanged.  \n- **Moving DOWN**: The head moves to (4,3), which is empty. No apple is eaten, and the tail shrinks similarly.  \n\nTo maximize the score, the optimal choice is to move RIGHT and eat the apple.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#    A #\n# SS  A#\n# ASSH #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (3,4) (row 3, column 4), and the current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n### Analysis of possible moves:\n1. **RIGHT**: The head would move to (3,5). This cell is empty (safe), but no apple is present here.\n2. **DOWN**: The head would move to (4,4). This cell is empty (safe), but no apple is present here.\n3. **UP**: The head would move to (2,4). This cell is empty (safe), and importantly, moving UP next epoch would allow the head to reach (1,4), which contains an apple ('A'). This path leads directly toward an apple.\n\n### Conclusion:\nChoosing UP allows the snake to position itself to eat an apple in the next move, making it the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#    A #\n#  S HA#\n# ASSS #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and collision risks:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at row 2, column 4.\n- **Current Direction**: UP (snake is moving upward).\n- **Apple Positions**: Apples 'A' are at (1,4) (row 1, column 4), (2,5) (row 2, column 5), and (3,1) (row 3, column 1).\n- **Movement Constraints**: The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., UP → DOWN is invalid). From the current direction (UP), valid directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n### Evaluation of Possible Directions:\n1. **UP**:  \n   - New head position: (1,4) (row 1, column 4), which contains an apple ('A').  \n   - Safety Check: (1,4) is within the board (not a wall) and not occupied by the snake's body (current body segments are at (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)).  \n   - Outcome: Eats the apple, grows in length, and increases the score.  \n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   - New head position: (2,5) (row 2, column 5), which contains an apple ('A').  \n   - Safety Check: (2,5) is within the board (not a wall) and not occupied by the snake's body.  \n   - Outcome: Eats the apple, grows in length, and increases the score.  \n\n3. **LEFT**:  \n   - New head position: (2,3) (row 2, column 3), which is empty (no apple).  \n   - Outcome: No apple eaten, snake length remains the same.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth UP and RIGHT directions allow the snake to eat an apple. Since the goal is to maximize apples eaten, either direction is valid. However, moving UP continues the current direction and directly targets the apple above the head, making it a straightforward choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#    H #\n#  S SA#\n# ASSS #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (1,4) (row 1, column 4) and is currently moving UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). Moving UP would collide with the top wall (row 0, column 4 is a '#'), so UP is also invalid. The remaining valid directions are LEFT and RIGHT.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (1,3). This position is empty (no collision with walls or the snake's body). However, the next possible moves (UP, DOWN, or LEFT) risk collisions: UP leads to a wall (row 0, column 3), DOWN leads to (2,3) (a body segment 'S'), and LEFT leads to (1,2) (safe but not near apples).\n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (1,5). This position is empty (no collision). The next direction can be DOWN (allowed, as RIGHT's reverse is LEFT). Moving DOWN from (1,5) would reach (2,5), which contains an apple ('A'). This allows the snake to eat the apple, grow, and increase the score.\n\nChoosing RIGHT is optimal, as it positions the snake to reach an apple in the next move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#    SH#\n#    SA#\n# ASSS #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nTo determine the next direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Position**: The snake's head 'H' is at (row 1, column 5). The body 'S' segments are at (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2).\n2. **Current Direction**: The snake is moving RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so LEFT is invalid.\n3. **Possible Moves**:\n   - **UP**: Moving UP from (1,5) leads to (0,5), which is a wall. Collision → Game Over.\n   - **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (1,5) leads to (1,6), which is a wall. Collision → Game Over.\n   - **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (1,5) leads to (2,5), which contains an apple 'A'.

Reversing direction (UP) is not allowed.\n3. **Collision Risks**:\n   - **DOWN**: Next position would be (row 3, column 5).

The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n# SSS  #\n#A  SSS#\n#     H#\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 17\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n"],"action":"RIGHT","response":["\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current position, available apples, and movement constraints. The snake's head is at (4,3) (row 4, column 3), moving UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). The possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (1,1), (2,5), and (5,1).\n2. **Manhattan Distance to Apples**: \n   - (5,1): Distance = (5-4) + (3-1) = 3 (closest).\n   - (2,5): Distance = (4-2) + (5-3) = 4.\n   - (1,1): Distance = (4-1) + (3-1) = 5.\n3. **Path to Closest Apple (5,1)**: \n   - The snake cannot move DOWN immediately (reverse of UP), but moving LEFT first (to (4,2)) allows subsequent movement toward (5,1). From (4,2), the snake can move DOWN (to (5,2)) and then LEFT (to (5,1)), reaching the apple in 3 steps.\n\n### Evaluation of Directions:\n- **UP**: Moves head to (3,3), away from the closest apple (5,1).\n- **RIGHT**: Moves head to (4,4), also away from (5,1).\n- **LEFT**: Moves head to (4,2), positioning it to eventually reach (5,1) (the closest apple) in subsequent steps.\n\nThus, the optimal direction is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n# H    #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Current Board Details:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at position (row 4, column 2) (0-indexed rows and columns).\n- Current direction: LEFT.\n- Apples ('A') are located at (1,1), (2,6), and (5,1).\n- The snake starts with length 1 (only the head), so no body segments exist yet.\n\n### Movement Constraints:\n- The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., LEFT → RIGHT is invalid). Thus, from LEFT, valid directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (continuing the current direction).\n\n### Analysis of Possible Directions:\n1. **LEFT (Current Direction):**  \n   Moving LEFT would take the head to (4,1) (a safe, empty space). However, the next move (epoch 3) would require continuing LEFT, leading to (4,0), which is a wall (column 0 is a wall). This would end the game immediately in the next epoch. **This is unsafe.**\n\n2. **UP:**  \n   Moving UP takes the head to (3,2) (a safe, empty space). However, (3,2) is not near any apples, and subsequent moves would need to navigate toward apples, which are not immediately accessible. **No immediate apple gain.**\n\n3. **DOWN:**  \n   Moving DOWN takes the head to (5,2) (a safe, empty space). From (5,2), the next move (epoch 3) can be LEFT (valid, as DOWN → LEFT is not a reversal). This would move the head to (5,1), which contains an apple. Eating this apple increases the score and grows the snake. **This leads to an apple in the next epoch.**\n\n4. **RIGHT:**  \n   Reversing direction (LEFT → RIGHT is invalid). **Not allowed.**\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN avoids immediate wall collision, positions the snake to reach an apple in the next epoch, and is the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#AH    #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (row 5, column 2), and the current direction is DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction (so UP is invalid). Possible directions to choose are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN. \n\n- **DOWN**: Moving down would take the head to (row 6, column 2), which is empty (no apple, no collision).  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving right would take the head to (row 5, column 3), which is empty (no apple, no collision).  \n- **LEFT**: Moving left would take the head to (row 5, column 1), which contains an apple 'A'. Eating this apple would increase the score by 1, grow the snake's length, and update the board (old head becomes 'S', new head is 'H' at the apple's position).  \n\nChoosing LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, which is optimal for maximizing the score. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n# A    #\n#HS    #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (5,1) (row 5, column 1), with a body segment at (5,2). The current direction is LEFT, and the snake cannot reverse to RIGHT. \n\n### Analysis of possible directions:\n1. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (5,1) would take the head to (5,0), which is a wall (column 0 of row 5 is '#'). This causes a collision, so LEFT is invalid.  \n2. **RIGHT**: Reversing direction (from LEFT to RIGHT) is not allowed per the rules.  \n3. **UP**: Moving UP from (5,1) takes the head to (4,1). Checking (4,1) on the board (row 4: \"# A    #\"), this position is empty (no wall or body segment). The new body segment will move to the old head position (5,1), so no self-collision occurs. This direction is safe.  \n4. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (5,1) takes the head to (6,1). Checking (6,1) on the board (row 6: \"#      #\"), this position is empty. The new body segment will move to (5,1), so no self-collision occurs. This direction is also safe.  \n\n### Choosing the optimal direction:\nThe goal is to reach apples. The closest apple is at (4,2) (row 4, column 2). Moving UP to (4,1) positions the snake to then move RIGHT (next possible direction) to (4,2), where it can eat the apple. This path is more favorable than moving DOWN, which does not lead toward any nearby apples.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#HA    #\n#S     #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Current Board and Snake Position:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at (4,1) (row 4, column 1).\n- The snake's body ('S') is at (5,1) (row 5, column 1).\n- Current direction is UP, so the snake cannot reverse to DOWN. Possible directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Moves:\n1. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (4,1) would take the head to (4,0), which is a wall ('#'). This causes a collision, ending the game. **Invalid**.\n   \n2. **UP**: Moving UP from (4,1) takes the head to (3,1). This square is empty (no wall or body), so it is safe. However, no apple is present here, so the snake does not grow, and the score remains unchanged.\n\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (4,1) takes the head to (4,2). This square contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score by 1, and the snake grows in length. The new head position (4,2) is safe (no wall or self-collision).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple, grow, and avoid collisions. This is the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#     A#\n#SH    #\n#S     #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: Head ('H') is at (row 4, column 2). Body ('S') segments are at (row 4, column 1) and (row 5, column 1). The snake length is 3 (head + 2 body segments), indicating 2 apples have been eaten (since starting length is 1, each apple increases length by 1).\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid).\n- **Apples**: Located at (row 1, column 1), (row 2, column 6), and (row 3, column 6).\n- **Collision Checks**: The snake loses if it hits walls (board edges) or itself.\n\n### Possible Directions (excluding LEFT, which is a reverse):\n1. **RIGHT**: New head position is (4, 3). Safe (no walls\/body collision), but moves away from the closest apple (row 1, column 1).\n2. **UP**: New head position is (3, 2). Safe. This direction moves the snake toward the closest apple (row 1, column 1), reducing the Manhattan distance to the apple.\n3. **DOWN**: New head position is (5, 2). Safe, but moves the snake away from all apples.\n\n### Optimal Choice:\nMoving UP directs the snake toward the closest apple (row 1, column 1) and avoids collision. This path maximizes the chance to eat an apple next.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n# H   A#\n#SS    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, apple positions, and movement constraints. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: Head (H) is at (3,2) (row 3, column 2). Body (S) is at (4,2) and (4,3).\n- **Current Direction**: UP (snake cannot reverse to DOWN).\n- **Apple Positions**: (1,1), (2,6), (3,6).\n- **Goal**: Move toward apples safely without collision.\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **UP**: Next head position is (2,2). This square is empty (no walls or body). Moving UP keeps the snake aligned with the closest apple at (1,1) (Manhattan distance 3) and avoids the body (which is in row 4, columns 2-3).  \n2. **LEFT**: Next head position is (3,1). Empty, but this moves the snake away from the nearest apple (1,1) and toward the left edge.  \n3. **RIGHT**: Next head position is (3,3). Empty, but this moves toward the apple at (3,6) (distance 4), which is farther than (1,1).  \n\n### Best Move:\nMoving **UP** is optimal. It keeps the snake on a path toward the closest apple (1,1) while avoiding collisions with walls or its body. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#A     #\n# H   A#\n# S   A#\n# S    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (row 2, column 2). The body segments (S) are at (row 3, column 2) and (row 4, column 2). The current direction is UP, so the snake cannot reverse to DOWN. Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n### Analysis of each possible direction:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (row 1, column 2). This position is empty (no wall or body collision). After moving, the head is at (1,2), and the body shifts to (2,2) and (3,2). From here, the next move could be LEFT to reach the apple at (1,1) in the following step.\n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (row 2, column 1). This position is empty (no wall or body collision). After moving, the head is at (2,1), and the body shifts to (2,2) and (3,2). From here, the next move could be UP to directly reach the apple at (1,1) in the following step.\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (row 2, column 3). This position is empty (no wall or body collision). However, reaching the nearest apple (at (2,5) or (3,5)) would require more steps compared to moving UP or LEFT.\n\n### Best Choice:\nMoving LEFT allows the snake to position itself one step away from the apple at (1,1), enabling a direct UP move to eat the apple in the next step. This path is shorter and more efficient than other options.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#HS   A#\n# S   A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (2,1) (row 2, column 1), moving in the current direction LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so it cannot choose RIGHT. The possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT. \n\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (2,0), which is a wall (column 0 is a wall in all rows). This causes a collision, ending the game. Thus, LEFT is invalid.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (1,1), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1, and the snake grows in length. The new head position (1,1) is safe (not a wall or body segment), so this is a valid and beneficial move.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (3,1), an empty space. No apple is eaten, so the snake does not grow, and the score remains unchanged. This is safe but does not provide immediate progress.  \n\nChoosing UP allows the snake to eat an apple, grow, and increase the score, making it the optimal choice. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#HA    #\n#SS   A#\n# S   A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving UP and cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is not allowed). Let's analyze possible directions:\n\n1. **UP**: The snake's head is at (1,1) (row 1, column 1). Moving UP would take it to (0,1), which is a wall ('#'). This causes a collision, ending the game. Invalid.\n\n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (1,0), which is a wall ('#') in row 1, column 0. Collision, game over. Invalid.\n\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (1,2). Checking row 1: \"#HA    #\", column 2 is 'A' (an apple). The head moves to the apple, which is safe (no collision with body: body segments are at (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)). Eating the apple increases the score by 1 and the snake grows. Valid and optimal.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SH    #\n#SS   A#\n# S   A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (1, 2) (row 1, column 2). The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (0, 2), which is a wall (row 0 is all '#'). This causes a collision and ends the game.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (2, 2), which is occupied by the snake's body (row 2, column 2 is 'S'). This causes a self-collision and ends the game.  \n- **LEFT**: Reversing direction from RIGHT to LEFT is not allowed.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (1, 3), which is empty (no wall or self-collision). This is a valid move.  \n\nThe only safe direction is RIGHT.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SSH   #\n#SS   A#\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The snake's head ('H') is at (1, 3) (row 1, column 3). The body ('S') occupies (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), and (2, 2).\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (LEFT is invalid).\n- **Apples**: Located at (2, 6), (3, 6), and (6, 6) (all in column 6, right side of the board).\n- **Goal**: Move toward apples while avoiding walls and self-collision.\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP from (1, 3) would take the head to (0, 3), which is a wall (row 0 is the top boundary). **Invalid** (collision).\n2. **LEFT**: Reverse of current direction (RIGHT). **Invalid** (snake cannot reverse).\n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (1, 3) takes the head to (2, 3), a safe empty space (no collision with body\/walls). This path could lead toward apples but requires additional rightward moves.\n4. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (1, 3) takes the head to (1, 4), a safe empty space. Continuing RIGHT would progress toward column 6 (where apples are located), with future moves like (1, 5) → (1, 6) → (2, 6) (apple at (2, 6)).\n\n### Optimal Choice:\nMoving RIGHT aligns with the snake's current direction and directly progresses toward the nearest apple at (2, 6). This path avoids collisions and efficiently navigates toward the target.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SSSH  #\n#S    A#\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, we analyze the snake's position, current direction (RIGHT), and apple locations. The snake's head (H) is at (1,4) (row 1, column 4), with body segments (S) at (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), and (2,1). Apples (A) are at (2,5), (3,5), and (6,5).\n\n### Possible Directions:\n- **UP**: Moving up from (1,4) leads to (0,4), which is a wall (row 0 is all '#'). Collision with the wall ends the game. **Invalid**.\n- **LEFT**: Current direction is RIGHT; reversing to LEFT is not allowed. **Invalid**.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving right from (1,4) leads to (1,5), an empty cell (no collision). However, (1,5) is not an apple, so the snake does not grow. This delays reaching the nearest apple at (2,5).\n- **DOWN**: Moving down from (1,4) leads to (2,4), an empty cell (no collision with walls or body). From (2,4), the next move can be RIGHT to (2,5), which contains an apple. This allows the snake to eat the apple in the next epoch.\n\n### Optimal Choice:\nMoving DOWN now positions the snake to reach the nearest apple at (2,5) in the next move, maximizing score growth.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SSSS  #\n#   H A#\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. The snake's head is at (2,3) (row 2, column 3), moving DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction (UP is invalid), so valid directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Apples are at (2,5), (3,5), and (6,5)** (row 2 column 5, row 3 column 5, row 6 column 5).\n- **Moving DOWN** would take the head to (3,3) (empty, no apple).\n- **Moving LEFT** would take the head to (2,2) (empty, no apple).\n- **Moving RIGHT** would take the head to (2,4) (empty, no apple), but this positions the head one step away from the apple at (2,5). From (2,4), the snake can then move RIGHT again to (2,5) in the next epoch to eat the apple, increasing the score.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT is optimal, as it sets up the snake to reach the nearest apple at (2,5) in the next move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# SSS  #\n#   SHA#\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's position, current direction, and potential moves:\n\n1. **Snake Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 2, column 5). The body 'S' segments are at (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), and (2,4).  \n2. **Current Direction**: RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). Valid directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.  \n3. **Move Analysis**:  \n   - **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (2,6), which contains an apple 'A'. This is safe (no collision with walls or self) and will increase the score by 1.  \n   - **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (1,5), a blank space with no apple.  \n   - **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (3,5), a blank space with no apple.  \n\nThe safest and highest-scoring move is to continue moving RIGHT to eat the apple at (2,6).  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# SSS  #\n#A  SSH#\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at position (row 2, column 6).\n- Current direction: RIGHT (moving right).\n- The snake cannot reverse direction, so LEFT (reverse of RIGHT) is invalid.\n- Moving RIGHT would take the head to (2, 7), which is a wall (collision, game over). Thus, RIGHT is invalid.\n- Remaining valid directions: UP or DOWN.\n\n### Analysis of UP:\n- Moving UP would take the head to (1, 6). This position is empty (no walls, body, or apples). While safe, this direction does not lead toward nearby apples and may risk future collisions (e.g., moving left from (1,6) could lead to body segments in row 1).\n\n### Analysis of DOWN:\n- Moving DOWN takes the head to (3, 6). This position is empty (no walls, body, or apples). Importantly, from (3, 6), the next move (e.g., LEFT) can reach the apple at (3, 5), allowing the snake to eat the apple, grow, and increase the score. This direction is safer and aligns with the goal of eating apples.\n\nThus, the best choice is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n# SSS  #\n#A  SSS#\n#     H#\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (3,5) (row 3, column 5), and the current direction is DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction (so UP is invalid). Possible directions are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n### Analysis of each direction:\n- **DOWN**: Next head position is (4,5) (row 4, column 5), which is a safe empty space. No apple here. This leads toward row 5 but requires additional moves to reach the apple at (5,1).\n- **LEFT**: Next head position is (3,4) (row 3, column 4), a safe empty space. This leads toward the left but requires multiple left moves to reach the apple at (2,1), with a longer path.\n- **RIGHT**: Next head position is (3,6) (row 3, column 6), a safe empty space. From here, moving DOWN three times reaches the apple at (6,6) (row 6, column 6) in 4 total steps (RIGHT → DOWN → DOWN → DOWN). This is the shortest path to an apple.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT allows the snake to reach the nearest apple (6,6) in the fewest steps without collision. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The goal of the game is to control the snake, eat as many apples as possible, and grow the snake in length. Each time the snake eats an apple, the score increases by one. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point.

The current direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is not allowed). The goal is to move toward the apples located at (5,3), (6,3), and (6,5) to maximize score. \n\nPossible directions for the next move are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (since DOWN is a reversal of UP and thus invalid). \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (3,3), which is empty but moves the snake away from the apples below.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (4,2), which is empty. This positions the snake to potentially move DOWN next (allowed, as LEFT → DOWN is not a reversal) and then RIGHT to reach the apple at (5,3).  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (4,4), which is empty. This positions the snake to potentially move DOWN next (allowed, as RIGHT → DOWN is not a reversal) and then LEFT to reach the apple at (5,3).  \n\nBoth LEFT and RIGHT set the snake on a path to reach the nearest apple (5,3) in subsequent moves. However, moving RIGHT is chosen here as it aligns with a more direct path toward the cluster of apples in row 6 (specifically (6,5)), which may allow for more efficient apple collection later.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   H  #\n#  A   #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT, and the snake's head is at position (4,4) (row 4, column 4). The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid), leaving UP, DOWN, or RIGHT as possible moves. \n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (4,5), which is empty (no apple, no collision). This does not help reach an apple immediately.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (3,4), which is empty (no apple, no collision). This also does not help reach an apple.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (5,4), which is empty (no collision). From (5,4), the next move (if direction changes to LEFT) can reach the apple at (5,3) in the following epoch. This positions the snake to eat an apple soon.  \n\nChoosing DOWN allows the snake to approach the nearest apple (at (5,3)) in the next move. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  AH  #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (row 5, column 4), and the current direction is DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction (UP is the reverse of DOWN, so UP is invalid). The possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continuing DOWN. \n\n- **Moving DOWN**: The next head position would be (row 6, column 4), which is an empty space (no apple). This is safe but does not eat an apple.  \n- **Moving RIGHT**: The next head position would be (row 5, column 5), which is an empty space. This is safe but does not eat an apple.  \n- **Moving LEFT**: The next head position is (row 5, column 3), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1, grows the snake's length by 1, and is valid (no collision with walls or the snake's body, as the snake currently has length 1).  \n\nMoving LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, which is optimal for maximizing the score. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  HS  #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, analyze the current game state:\n\n- **Snake Position**: Head (H) at (row 5, column 2); Body (S) at (row 5, column 3). Current direction: LEFT.\n- **Apples**: Located at (row 2, column 2), (row 6, column 2), and (row 6, column 5).\n- **Movement Constraints**: The snake cannot reverse direction (LEFT → RIGHT is invalid). Valid directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Directions:\n1. **LEFT (Current Direction)**:  \n   Next head position: (row 5, column 1). This cell is empty (no apple). The snake moves but does not grow. No score gain.\n\n2. **UP**:  \n   Next head position: (row 4, column 2). This cell is empty (no apple). The snake moves but does not grow. No score gain.\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   Next head position: (row 6, column 2). This cell contains an apple ('A'). Moving here allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score by 1 and growing in length. The new head position (row 6, column 2) is within the board (no wall collision) and does not overlap with the snake’s body (current body is at (row 5, column 3); new body segments will be (row 5, column 2) and (row 5, column 3) after growth, avoiding collision).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN is the optimal choice, as it allows the snake to eat an apple, grow, and increase the score.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SS  #\n#  H  A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (6, 2) (row 6, column 2). The current direction is DOWN, and the snake cannot reverse to UP. The snake must choose between LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. Moving DOWN would lead to (7, 2), which is a wall (row 7 is all '#'), causing a collision. Thus, DOWN is invalid. \n\nAnalyzing LEFT and RIGHT:\n- **LEFT**: The head would move to (6, 1), which is empty. However, this direction moves away from the nearest apple at (6, 5) (row 6, column 5) and requires more steps to reach other apples.\n- **RIGHT**: The head would move to (6, 3), which is empty. This direction moves toward the apple at (6, 5). Continuing RIGHT in subsequent moves would allow the snake to reach (6, 5) in 2 more steps, eating the apple and growing.\n\nRIGHT is the optimal choice as it leads toward the nearest apple and avoids collisions.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  S   #\n#  SH A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (6, 4) (row 6, column 4), with body segments (S) at (6, 3) and (5, 3). The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse to LEFT. Possible directions to choose are RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. \n\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to row 7, column 4, which is a wall (`#`). This causes a collision, ending the game.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (5, 4), an empty space. This is safe but does not directly approach any apple.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (6, 5), an empty space. This is safe and positions the snake to reach the apple at (6, 6) in the next move (if continuing RIGHT), allowing the snake to eat the apple and grow.  \n\nChoosing RIGHT is optimal as it avoids collision, maintains progress, and sets up to eat an apple in the next step.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SSHA#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (6,4) (row 6, column 4), with its body at (6,3) and (6,2). The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). \n\nAnalyzing possible directions:\n- **RIGHT**: The next head position is (6,5), which contains an apple ('A'). Moving RIGHT will allow the snake to eat the apple, increase the score by 1, and grow in length. There is no collision with walls or the snake's body.\n- **UP**: The next head position is (5,4), which is empty. This move is safe but does not eat an apple.\n- **DOWN**: The next head position is (7,4), which is a wall ('#'). This would cause a collision and end the game.\n\nThe optimal choice is to move RIGHT to eat the apple and gain a point. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#   A  #\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SSSH#\n########\n\nTo determine the next direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 6, column 6).  \n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so LEFT is invalid.  \n- **Possible Directions**: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (since LEFT is reversed).  \n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **RIGHT**: New head position would be (6, 7), which is a wall (row 6 ends with '#'). Collision with the wall → Game Over. Invalid.  \n2. **DOWN**: New head position would be (7, 6), which is a wall (row 7 is all '#'). Collision with the wall → Game Over. Invalid.  \n3. **UP**: New head position is (5, 6). Row 5 is \"#      #\", so (5, 6) is empty (no wall or snake body). Safe move.  \n\nThe only safe direction is UP.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#   A  #\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     H#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: Head (H) is at (5,5). Body (S) segments are at (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) (tail to head order).\n- **Current Direction**: UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid).\n- **Apples**: Located at (1,3), (2,2), (2,5).\n- **Walls**: Bound the board edges (rows 0 and 7, columns 0 and 7).\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **UP**:  \n   - Next head position: (4,5) (row 5 → row 4, column 5).  \n   - Check safety: (4,5) is within the board (not a wall) and not occupied by the snake’s body (current body segments are at (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)).  \n   - Long-term path: Continuing UP will move the head toward (3,5) and then (2,5), where an apple is located. This is a safe, apple-oriented path.\n\n2. **LEFT**:  \n   - Next head position: (5,4) (column 5 → column 4).  \n   - Check safety: (5,4) is within the board and not occupied by the snake’s body.  \n   - Long-term path: Moving LEFT leads to (5,3), (5,2), etc., which are empty and do not lead directly to apples.\n\n3. **RIGHT**:  \n   - Next head position: (5,6) (column 5 → column 6).  \n   - Check safety: (5,6) is a wall (row 5 ends with '#'), causing an immediate collision. **Invalid**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP is safe, avoids collisions, and aligns with a path toward the apple at (2,5). \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#   A  #\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#     H#\n#     S#\n#    SS#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: Head (H) at (4,5), body segments (S) at (5,5), (6,5), (6,4).\n- **Apples**: Located at (1,3), (2,1), and (2,4).\n- **Current Direction**: UP.

This square is empty (no apple, no collision). However, this does not directly approach any apple.\n   \n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (4,4). This square is empty (no collision). From (4,4), the snake can then move UP toward (3,4) and (2,4), which is an apple. This path directly approaches the nearest apple at (2,4).\n\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (4,6). This square is empty (no apple, no collision), but it moves away from all apples, making it suboptimal.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT is the best choice as it positions the snake to approach the nearest apple at (2,4) in subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   A  #\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#    HS#\n#     S#\n#     S#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (4,4) (row 4, column 4), moving LEFT. The body segments are at (4,5), (5,5), and (6,5). The apples are at (1,4), (2,1), and (2,4). The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). Possible directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN.\n\n- **LEFT**: Next head position is (4,3) (empty). Safe but no apple.\n- **DOWN**: Next head position is (5,4) (empty). Safe but moves toward the bottom wall, with no immediate apple.\n- **UP**: Next head position is (3,4) (empty). Safe and moves toward the apple at (2,4) (one step above (3,4)). This positions the snake to eat that apple in the next move.\n\nMoving UP is optimal as it aligns the snake with an apple in the next step. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   A  #\n# A  A #\n#    H #\n#    SS#\n#     S#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (3,4) (row 3, column 4) and moving UP.

Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (2,4) (row 2, column 4), which is empty. This avoids collision with walls or the body. From (2,4), the next move could be RIGHT to reach (2,5) (an apple), allowing the snake to eat it in the next epoch.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (3,3), which is empty but further from the nearest apples (requires more steps to reach an apple).  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (3,5), which is empty. From (3,5), the next move could be UP to reach (2,5) (an apple), but this is equivalent to the UP path in terms of steps.  \n\nThe closest apples are at (2,5) and (2,2). Moving UP first positions the snake to reach (2,5) (an apple) in the next epoch with a RIGHT move, which is optimal. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   A  #\n# A  H #\n#   AS #\n#    SS#\n#     S#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (2,5) (row 2, column 5), and the current direction is UP. The snake cannot reverse direction, so possible moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (DOWN is invalid). \n\n### Analysis of possible moves:\n1. **UP**: Next head position is (1,5). This is an empty space (no apple). However, moving UP again in the next epoch would hit the wall (row 0 is a wall), risking collision.  \n2. **RIGHT**: Next head position is (2,6). This is an empty space (no apple). Moving RIGHT further would approach the wall (column 7 is a wall) and move away from existing apples, which are at (1,3), (2,2), and (3,3).  \n3. **LEFT**: Next head position is (2,4). This is an empty space (no apple) and avoids collision with the snake's body (current body segments are at (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)). Moving LEFT positions the head closer to the apple at (2,2) (two steps left from (2,4)), allowing a future move to eat that apple.  \n\nLEFT is the optimal choice as it avoids immediate risks and positions the snake to reach an apple in subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#   A  #\n# A HS #\n#   AS #\n#    SS#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game board, snake position, and movement constraints:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head ('H') is at row 2, column 4 (coordinates (2,4)).\n- **Current Direction**: LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (cannot turn RIGHT).\n- **Possible Directions**: UP, DOWN, or LEFT (RIGHT is invalid due to reversal rule).\n- **Snake Body**: 'S' positions are (2,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5). Colliding with these or walls ends the game.\n- **Apples**: Apples ('A') are at (1,4), (2,2), (3,3).\n\n### Direction Analysis:\n1. **LEFT**: Next head position is (2,3). This cell is empty (no apple, no collision). Safe but no score gain.\n2. **UP**: Next head position is (1,4), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1 and grows the snake. No collision risk (cell is not a wall or body part).\n3. **DOWN**: Next head position is (3,4), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). Collision occurs, ending the game. Invalid.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP is the best choice as it allows the snake to eat an apple, grow, and avoid collision.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   H  #\n# A SS #\n#   AS #\n#    SS#\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving UP. Since the snake cannot reverse direction, the next direction cannot be DOWN. The possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **Moving UP**: The head (at row 1, column 4) would move to row 0, column 4, which is a wall. This causes a collision, ending the game. Thus, UP is invalid.  \n- **Moving RIGHT**: The head would move to row 1, column 5 (a safe empty space). This avoids collision but does not lead directly to an apple.  \n- **Moving LEFT**: The head would move to row 1, column 3 (a safe empty space). This direction positions the snake to eventually reach the nearest apple at (row 2, column 2) in subsequent moves (e.g., moving LEFT again to row 1, column 2, then DOWN to row 2, column 2 to eat the apple).  \n\nGiven the goal to eat apples and avoid collisions, LEFT is the optimal choice. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#  HS  #\n# A SS #\n#   AS #\n#    S #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The snake's head ('H') is at (row 1, column 3). The body ('S') segments are at (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5).\n- **Current Direction**: LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (RIGHT is invalid). Allowed directions: LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n- **Apples**: Located at (2,2), (3,4), and (5,6).\n- **Collision Risks**: \n  - UP would move the head to (0,3), which is a wall (game over).\n  - RIGHT is a reversal of LEFT (invalid).\n  - LEFT and DOWN are the only valid options.\n\n### Analysis of Valid Directions:\n1. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (1,2) (empty space). This is safe, but no apple is eaten. The snake’s body shifts, with the tail (4,5) removed. From (1,2), the next move could be DOWN to (2,2) (apple) in the following step.\n   \n2. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (2,3) (empty space). This is safe, and no apple is eaten. The snake’s body shifts similarly. From (2,3), the next move could be LEFT to (2,2) (apple) in the following step.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth LEFT and DOWN are safe. However, moving DOWN positions the head closer to the apple at (2,2) (one step left from (2,3)) and avoids potential wall proximity issues in subsequent moves. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  SS  #\n# AHSS #\n#   AS #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (2, 2) (row 2, column 2), and the current direction is DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction, so the allowed directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (UP is invalid as it would reverse the current direction). \n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (2, 2) would take the head to (2, 3), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This causes a self-collision, ending the game. Thus, RIGHT is invalid.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (2, 2) would take the head to (3, 2), which is an empty space (' '). This is safe but does not eat an apple.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (2, 2) would take the head to (2, 1), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1 and allows the snake to grow safely without collision (since (2, 1) is not a wall or body part).  \n\nThe optimal move is to eat the adjacent apple by moving LEFT. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  SSA #\n# HSSS #\n#   AS #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (row 2, column 2) and is currently moving LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). The valid directions to consider are UP, DOWN, or continuing LEFT. \n\n### Analysis of each possible direction:\n1. **LEFT**: The next head position would be (2, 1) (column 1 of row 2), which is a space (safe). However, moving LEFT further would lead to (2, 0) (a wall) in the next step, risking collision. No apple is present here.\n2. **UP**: The next head position would be (1, 2) (row 1, column 2), which is a space (safe). However, moving UP further would reach (0, 2) (a wall), and moving RIGHT from (1, 2) would collide with the snake's body (S at (1, 3)). This direction is risky.\n3. **DOWN**: The next head position would be (3, 2) (row 3, column 2), which is a space (safe). From (3, 2), the snake can move RIGHT to (3, 3) (space) and then RIGHT again to (3, 4) (an apple). This path avoids collisions and leads directly to an apple.\n\nThe safest and most strategic direction is DOWN, as it allows the snake to approach the apple at (3, 4) without risk of collision.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  SSA #\n# SSSS #\n# H A  #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (3, 2) (row 3, column 2). The current direction is DOWN, and the snake cannot reverse to UP. Possible directions to choose are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN. \n\nKey observations:\n1. **Apple positions**: Apples are at (1, 5), (3, 4), and (5, 6).\n2. **Closest apple**: The apple at (3, 4) is in the same row as the head (row 3), two columns to the right (column 4).\n3. **Movement analysis**:\n   - Moving DOWN (current direction) would take the head to (4, 2), a safe but empty space (no apple).\n   - Moving LEFT would take the head to (3, 1), a safe but empty space (no apple).\n   - Moving RIGHT would take the head to (3, 3), a safe space. From (3, 3), the next move RIGHT would reach the apple at (3, 4), allowing the snake to eat it.\n\nChoosing RIGHT allows the snake to position itself to reach the closest apple in the next step. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  SSA #\n# SSS  #\n# SHA  #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (3, 2) (row 3, column 2), and the current direction is RIGHT.

This is safe (no collision with walls or self) and will eat the apple, increasing the score by 1 and growing the snake.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  SSA #\n# SSS  #\n# SSH  #\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (3,3) (row 3, column 3) with the current direction RIGHT.

This is valid but does not immediately lead to an apple.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (4,3), a safe empty space. This direction allows the snake to approach the apple at (4,1) (row 4, column 1) in subsequent moves (e.g., LEFT twice), which is closer than other apples.  \n\nThe optimal choice is DOWN, as it avoids collision and positions the snake to reach an apple faster. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#  SSA #\n# SS   #\n# SSS  #\n#A  H  #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (4,4) (row 4, column 4), and it is currently moving DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction (so UP is invalid). The possible directions to choose are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. \n\n### Analysis of each direction:\n1. **DOWN**: The head would move to (5,4) (row 5, column 4), which is empty (no wall or body collision). From (5,4), the snake could then turn RIGHT to reach (5,5) (an apple) in the next move.  \n2. **LEFT**: The head would move to (4,3) (row 4, column 3), which is empty. From (4,3), the snake could then turn LEFT again to reach (4,2) (an apple) in the next move.  \n3. **RIGHT**: The head would move to (4,5) (row 4, column 5), which is empty. From (4,5), the snake could then turn DOWN to reach (5,5) (an apple) in the next move.  \n\nAll three directions are safe. However, moving RIGHT allows the snake to position itself closer to the apple at (5,5) (row 5, column 5), which is in an open area with minimal risk of collision. This path maximizes the snake's ability to grow by eating an apple soon.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  S A #\n# SS   #\n# SSS  #\n#A  SH #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is located at row 4, column 5.

From there, the next move can be DOWN to reach (5,6) (the apple) in the following step.\n- Other directions (UP or DOWN) would require more steps to reach the nearest apple or do not provide a clearer path.\n\nThus, moving RIGHT is the optimal choice to approach the nearest apple efficiently.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#    A #\n# SS   #\n# SSS  #\n#A  SSH#\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head ('H') is at (row 4, column 6).\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid).\n- **Possible Directions**: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. However, moving RIGHT would collide with the wall (row 4, column 7 is '#'), so RIGHT is invalid. This leaves UP and DOWN.\n\n### Analysis of UP:\n- New head position: (row 3, column 6). This is a space (' '), so no collision. However, this direction does not immediately lead toward an apple. Further moves in this direction may risk collision with the snake's body (e.g., moving left from (3,6) could eventually reach the body in row 3, columns 2-4).\n\n### Analysis of DOWN:\n- New head position: (row 5, column 6). This is a space (' '), so no collision. Importantly, this direction positions the snake to approach the apple at (row 5, column 5) in the next move. From (5,6), moving LEFT (allowed, as DOWN's reverse is UP) would reach the apple at (5,5), allowing the snake to eat it and grow.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN avoids immediate collision, positions the snake to reach an apple in the next step, and is safer than UP.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#    A #\n# SS  A#\n# SSS  #\n#A  SSS#\n#     H#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (row 5, column 6), and the current direction is DOWN.

This causes a collision, so RIGHT is invalid.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (6,6), which is a safe empty space (no wall or body collision).  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (5,5), which is also a safe empty space (no wall or body collision).  \n\nNo apples are present in the next positions for either DOWN or LEFT. However, moving DOWN would bring the head closer to the bottom wall (row 7). If the snake continues moving DOWN in the next epoch, it would collide with the wall. Moving LEFT avoids this immediate risk and provides more space to maneuver.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#    A #\n# S   A#\n# SSS  #\n#A  SSS#\n#    HS#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (row 5, column 4).

The snake can choose to move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (since DOWN is the reverse direction and not allowed). \n\n### Analysis of possible directions:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (row 3, column 3), which is empty. This is safe but does not eat an apple immediately. From here, the snake could turn RIGHT in the next epoch to reach (row 3, column 4), where an apple ('A') is located.  \n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (row 4, column 2), which is empty. This is safe but does not eat an apple immediately. From here, the snake could turn DOWN in the next epoch to reach (row 5, column 2), where another apple is located.  \n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (row 4, column 4), which is empty. This is safe but does not eat an apple immediately. From here, the snake could turn UP in the next epoch to reach (row 3, column 4), where an apple is located.  \n\nAll three directions are safe and allow the snake to reach an apple in the next epoch. However, moving RIGHT aligns the snake with the column of the apple at (row 3, column 4), making it a direct path to the apple in the next move. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#    A #\n#   H  #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (row 4, column 4) and is currently moving RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). We need to choose between UP, DOWN, or continuing RIGHT. \n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving right would take the head to (4, 5), which is empty (no apple, safe but no score gain).  \n- **UP**: Moving up takes the head to (3, 4), which contains an apple ('A'). This is safe (no collision with walls or self) and will eat the apple, increasing the score by 1.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving down takes the head to (5, 4), which is empty (no apple, safe but no score gain).  \n\nThe optimal choice is UP, as it allows the snake to eat an apple and grow. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#   HA #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (3,3) (row 3, column 3) and is currently moving UP. The snake cannot reverse direction, so the possible directions to choose are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (2,3), which is an empty space. No apple is present here, so the snake does not grow, and the score remains unchanged.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (3,2), which is also an empty space. No apple is present here, so the snake does not grow, and the score remains unchanged.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (3,4), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1, and the snake grows in length (the previous head position (3,3) becomes part of the body, marked as 'S').  \n\nSince moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, this is the optimal choice. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#   SH #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (3, 5) (row 3, column 5), with a body segment (S) at (3, 4). The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse to LEFT. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\n- **Moving RIGHT**: The head would move to (3, 6), which is empty. No apple is eaten, and the snake remains length 2. This is safe but does not increase the score.\n- **Moving DOWN**: The head would move to (4, 5), which is empty. No apple is eaten, and the snake remains length 2. This is safe but does not increase the score.\n- **Moving UP**: The head would move to (2, 5), which contains an apple (A). Eating the apple increases the score by 1 and grows the snake to length 3. The new head position (2, 5) is within the board and does not collide with the body (which is at (3, 4)), so this is safe.\n\nThe optimal choice is to move UP to eat the apple and increase the score.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#    H #\n#   SS #\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. The snake's head (H) is at (row 2, column 4), with body segments (S) at (row 3, column 4) and (row 3, column 3). The current direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). The apples are at (row 4, column 3), (row 5, column 2), and (row 6, column 3).\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **UP**: The new head would move to (row 1, column 4). This position is empty (no apple, wall, or body collision). However, moving UP further would risk hitting the top wall (row 0, column 4 is a wall) in subsequent moves, limiting the snake's ability to reach apples below.\n\n2. **RIGHT**: The new head would move to (row 2, column 5). This position is empty, but moving RIGHT further could hit the right wall (row 2, column 6 is a wall) in subsequent moves, making it difficult to navigate toward apples.\n\n3. **LEFT**: The new head would move to (row 2, column 3). This position is empty (no collision). After moving LEFT, the snake can then turn DOWN (allowed, as LEFT and DOWN are not reverse directions). Moving DOWN from (row 2, column 3) would take the head to (row 3, column 3) (empty), and another DOWN move would reach (row 4, column 3) (an apple), allowing the snake to eat the apple and grow.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT positions the snake to safely navigate toward the apple at (row 4, column 3) in subsequent moves, avoiding walls and self-collision.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#   HS #\n#    S #\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: Head (H) is at (row 2, column 4). Body segments (S) are at (row 2, column 5) and (row 3, column 5).\n- **Current Direction**: LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (RIGHT is invalid). Valid directions: UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n- **Apple Positions**: Apples (A) are at (row 4, column 4), (row 5, column 2), and (row 6, column 4).\n- **Goal**: Move toward apples to maximize score while avoiding collisions.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Moves:\n1. **LEFT (Continue Current Direction)**:  \n   The head would move to (row 2, column 3). This position is empty (no apple), and no collision occurs. However, this moves the snake left, away from the nearest apple at (row 4, column 4).\n\n2. **UP**:  \n   The head would move to (row 1, column 4). This position is empty (no apple), and no collision occurs. However, this moves the snake upward, away from the nearest apple at (row 4, column 4).\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   The head would move to (row 3, column 4). This position is empty (no apple), and no collision occurs. Importantly, this moves the snake directly toward the nearest apple at (row 4, column 4). If the snake continues moving DOWN in the next epoch, it will reach (row 4, column 4) and eat the apple, increasing the score.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN aligns the snake with the nearest apple, setting up a future opportunity to eat it. This is the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#   SS #\n#   H  #\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (3,3) (row 3, column 3) and is currently moving DOWN. The next position the head would move to if continuing DOWN is (4,3), which contains an apple ('A'). Moving DOWN allows the snake to eat the apple, increase the score by 1, and grow in length without colliding with walls or its own body. Other directions (LEFT, RIGHT) would move the head to empty spaces without apples, providing no immediate benefit. Since the snake cannot reverse direction (UP is invalid here), the optimal choice is to continue moving DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#   SS #\n#   S  #\n#   H A#\n# A    #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (row 4, column 3) (H), with body segments at (row 2, column 3), (row 2, column 4), (row 3, column 3), and (row 4, column 3) (the previous head position). The current direction is DOWN, and the snake cannot reverse to UP. Possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. \n\nAnalyzing each option:\n- **DOWN**: The head moves to (row 5, column 3) (empty). Next, moving DOWN again would reach (row 6, column 3) (apple). Safe.\n- **LEFT**: The head moves to (row 4, column 2) (empty). Next, moving DOWN would reach (row 5, column 2) (apple). Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: The head moves to (row 4, column 4) (empty). Next, moving RIGHT would reach (row 4, column 5) (apple). Safe.\n\nAll options are safe and can reach an apple in two steps. The apple at (row 4, column 5) is in the same row as the head, making RIGHT a direct path. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#   S  #\n#   S  #\n#   SHA#\n# A    #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4,4) (row 4, column 4), and the current direction is RIGHT.

The next head position is (4,5), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple will increase the score by 1, and the snake will grow. This move is safe (no collision with walls or body).  \n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (3,4). This cell is empty (no apple, no collision), but no score gain.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (5,4).

This causes a collision, so RIGHT is invalid.\n2. **Moving LEFT:** Reversing direction (RIGHT → LEFT) is not allowed per game rules.\n3. **Moving UP:** The head would move to (3,5). This cell is empty (no wall or snake body), so it is safe. After moving UP, the next possible directions (excluding reverse DOWN) could allow the snake to reach the apple at (3,4) in the next move (by turning LEFT).\n4. **Moving DOWN:** The head would move to (5,5).

However, the next move upward would reach row 0 (a wall), making this direction risky long-term.\n2. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (row 2, column 6), which is empty. The next move right would reach column 7 (a wall), making this direction risky.\n3. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (row 2, column 4), which is empty. This direction aligns the snake toward the apple at (row 3, column 3). Subsequent moves left (to row 2, column 3) and then down (to row 3, column 3) would allow the snake to reach the apple safely.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT is the best choice, as it avoids immediate collisions and positions the snake to reach an apple in future moves.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#   HS #\n#  A SS#\n#    SS#\n# A    #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: Head ('H') is at (row 2, column 4).

From here, the snake can turn RIGHT to (4,4) (an apple in the next move), allowing it to eat the apple quickly.\n\n### Optimal Choice:\nMoving **DOWN** allows the snake to position itself to reach the apple at (4,4) in the next step (by turning RIGHT), maximizing score growth safely.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#   SS #\n#  SSSS#\n#  H A #\n# A    #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 2) (row 4, column 2), moving in the DOWN direction.

This cell is empty (no apple or body collision), but no apple is eaten. Safe but no score gain.\n\n2. **RIGHT**:  \n   The head would move to (5,3). This cell is empty (no apple or body collision), but no apple is eaten. Safe but no score gain.\n\n3. **LEFT**:  \n   The head would move to (5,1), which contains an apple (A). Eating this apple increases the score by 1 and grows the snake. The new head position (5,1) is valid (not a wall or body segment), so no collision occurs. This is the only move that directly targets an apple.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple, increasing the score and growing the snake, making it the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#   SS #\n#  SSS #\n#  S A #\n# HSA  #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT.

The remaining valid directions are UP or DOWN.\n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to row 4, column 1 (empty, no collision). However, the next possible move (e.g., RIGHT) would lead to row 4, column 2, which is part of the snake’s body (S), risking collision.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to row 6, column 1 (empty, no collision). From there, subsequent RIGHT moves can reach the apple at row 6, column 3 (safe path).  \n\nDOWN is the safest choice to avoid immediate collision and approach an apple. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#   SS #\n#  SS  #\n#  S A #\n# SSA  #\n# H A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (row 6, column 2) with a current direction of DOWN. Moving DOWN would lead to a wall collision (row 7 is a wall), so the snake must avoid this. The snake cannot reverse direction (UP is the opposite of DOWN), leaving LEFT and RIGHT as valid options.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (6, 1). However, subsequent moves from (6, 1) risk collisions: UP leads to (5, 1) (a body segment), LEFT leads to (6, 0) (a wall), and DOWN leads to (7, 1) (a wall). This path is unsafe.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (6, 3), which is empty. From (6, 3), the next move RIGHT would reach (6, 4), an apple ('A'), allowing the snake to eat the apple, grow, and increase the score.

Checking row 5: \"# SSA #\", (5,2) is 'S' (part of the snake's body). Colliding with the body ends the game. UP is invalid.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (7,2). Row 7 is a wall (\"########\"), so (7,2) is a wall. Colliding with the wall ends the game. DOWN is invalid.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (6,3). Row 6: \"# SHA #\" shows (6,3) is 'A' (an apple). This position is not a wall or the snake's body.

This causes a collision, ending the game. So DOWN is invalid.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (6,4) takes the head to (6,5), which is empty (no collision with walls or the snake's body). However, (6,5) has no apple, so the snake does not grow.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP from (6,4) takes the head to (5,4), which is empty (no collision). (5,4) has no apple, but this positions the snake to potentially reach the apple at (5,3) in the next move. After moving UP, the snake can turn LEFT (allowed, as UP’s reverse is DOWN, not LEFT) to reach (5,3), which contains an apple.  \n\nChoosing UP allows the snake to approach the nearest apple (at (5,3)) safely, increasing the chance to eat it and grow. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#     A#\n#   S  #\n#  SS  #\n#  S A #\n# SSH  #\n# SSS A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 5, column 4).  \n2. **Current Direction**: UP (snake is moving upward).  \n3. **Possible Moves**: The snake cannot reverse direction (UP → DOWN is invalid), so valid directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (row 4, column 4). Checking row 4, column 4: it contains an apple 'A'. Eating this apple increases the score and grows the snake.

This cell is empty (safe, no wall or self-collision).\n   - **UP**: Next head position (3,5). This cell is empty (safe).\n   - **DOWN**: Next head position (5,5). This cell is empty (safe).\n3. **Apple Locations**: Apples are at (1,6), (4,2), and (6,6). None of the immediate next positions (4,6), (3,5), or (5,5) contain apples, so no immediate score gain.\n4. **Long-Term Path**: The apple at (6,6) is a priority. Moving RIGHT to (4,6) allows the snake to then move DOWN to (5,6) and again DOWN to (6,6) (the apple) in subsequent steps.

The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid), leaving UP, DOWN, or RIGHT as options.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Directions:\n1. **RIGHT**: The head moves to (4, 6), which is empty (no apple). This direction risks future collisions if the snake continues right (row 4, column 7 is a wall).

The goal of the game is to control the snake, eat as many apples as possible, and grow the snake in length. Each time the snake eats an apple, the score increases by one. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs.

The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# SSS H#\n# SSS  #\n# A S A#\n#   S  #\n#   A  #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 32\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n"],"action":"RIGHT","response":["\n\n########\n#      #\n# A    #\n#  A   #\n#  H A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Game Board Analysis**: The snake's head ('H') is at row 4, column 3 (0-indexed). Apples ('A') are located at (2,2), (3,3), and (4,5).\n2. **Current Direction**: The snake is moving UP. The snake cannot reverse direction, so DOWN is invalid. Valid directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n3. **Next Move Evaluation**:\n   - **UP**: Moving UP from (4,3) leads to (3,3), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1 and grows the snake.\n   - **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (4,3) leads to (4,2), an empty space. No apple is eaten.\n   - **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (4,3) leads to (4,4), an empty space. No apple is eaten.\n\nThe best choice is to continue moving UP to eat the apple at (3,3).\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#    A #\n# A    #\n#  H   #\n#  S A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. The snake's head is at (3,3) (row 3, column 3), with a body segment at (4,3). The current direction is UP, so the snake cannot reverse to DOWN. Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (1,5), (2,1), and (4,5) (row, column).\n2. **Snake Goals**: Eat apples to grow and avoid collisions with walls or itself.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Directions:\n- **UP (Continue Current Direction)**: The head moves to (2,3). This position is safe (no walls or body), but no apple is present. From (2,3), the snake could later move left toward (2,1) (apple) or up toward (1,5) (apple), but this path takes 3+ steps.\n- **LEFT**: The head moves to (3,2). Safe, but no apple. From (3,2), the snake could move up toward (2,2) and then left to (2,1) (apple), also taking 3+ steps.\n- **RIGHT**: The head moves to (3,4). Safe, no apple. From (3,4), the snake can then move DOWN to (4,4) (safe) and then RIGHT to (4,5) (apple). This path reaches an apple in 3 steps (RIGHT → DOWN → RIGHT), which is efficient.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT first allows the snake to strategically position itself to reach the apple at (4,5) in the fewest steps without collision. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#    A #\n# A    #\n#  SH  #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n- **Snake Position**: Head (H) at (row 3, column 3); Body (S) at (row 3, column 2).\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT (snake cannot reverse to LEFT).\n- **Apples**: Located at (row 1, column 4), (row 2, column 1), and (row 4, column 4).\n- **Goal**: Avoid collisions (walls\/self) and move toward apples.\n\n### Possible Directions (excluding LEFT, as reversing is invalid):\n1. **RIGHT**: New head position = (3, 4). This cell is empty (no apple). Moving RIGHT further risks hitting the right wall (column 7) in subsequent moves.\n   \n2. **UP**: New head position = (2, 3). This cell is empty (no apple). While safe, this direction does not directly lead toward nearby apples.\n   \n3. **DOWN**: New head position = (4, 3). This cell is empty (no apple). However, from (4, 3), the next move can be RIGHT to reach (4, 4), which contains an apple. This path sets up a clear opportunity to eat an apple in the next epoch.\n\n### Conclusion:\nChoosing **DOWN** allows the snake to position itself to reach the apple at (4, 4) in the next move, maximizing the score while avoiding immediate collisions.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#    A #\n# A    #\n#   S  #\n#   HA #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at position (4,3) (row 4, column 3).\n- The snake's body ('S') is at (3,3), indicating a current length of 2.\n- Current direction is DOWN, so the snake cannot reverse to UP. Valid directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n- Apples ('A') are at (1,4), (2,1), and (4,4) (adjacent to the head at (4,3)).\n\n### Analysis of possible directions:\n1. **DOWN**: Moving down would take the head to (5,3). This is a safe, empty space, but no apple is present. The snake would not grow, and the tail (3,3) would shift to (4,3). No score gain.\n2. **LEFT**: Moving left would take the head to (4,2). This is a safe, empty space, but no apple is present. The snake would not grow, and the tail (3,3) would shift to (4,3). No score gain.\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving right would take the head to (4,4), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple would:\n   - Increase the score by 1.\n   - Grow the snake's length to 3 (since the tail is not removed when eating an apple).\n   - Update the body positions to (4,3) (old head) and (3,3) (old body).\n   - No collision occurs (the new head position (4,4) is within bounds and not occupied by the snake's body).\n\nMoving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple, grow, and increase the score, making it the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#    A #\n#AA    #\n#   S  #\n#   SH #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (row 4, column 4), moving in the current direction RIGHT. The snake's body ('S') is at (row 4, column 3) and (row 3, column 3). Apples ('A') are located at (row 1, column 5), (row 2, column 1), and (row 2, column 2). \n\nThe snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (row 4, column 5), an empty cell. This is safe but moves the snake away from the closest apples (row 2, columns 1-2) and toward the right wall.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (row 5, column 4), an empty cell. This is safe but moves the snake toward the bottom wall, away from all apples.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (row 3, column 4), an empty cell. This direction positions the snake closer to the apples in row 2 (columns 1-2). After moving UP, the snake can later turn LEFT (allowed, as UP is not reversed) to approach (row 2, column 2), one of the closest apples.  \n\nMoving UP is optimal because it directs the snake toward the cluster of apples in row 2, increasing the chance to eat an apple sooner. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#    A #\n#AA    #\n#    H #\n#   SS #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, apple positions, and movement constraints:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The head 'H' is at (3,5) (row 3, column 5). The body 'S' segments are at (4,5) and (4,4).\n- **Current Direction**: UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid).\n- **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (1,5) (row 1, column 5), (2,2), and (2,3).\n- **Goal**: Move toward apples while avoiding walls and self-collision.\n\n### Direction Analysis:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (2,5). This position is empty (no wall\/body collision). From (2,5), continuing UP in the next epoch would reach (1,5), which contains an apple. This path safely leads to an apple in 2 steps.\n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (3,4). This position is empty, but reaching the nearest apple (2,2) from here would require multiple left and up moves, taking longer than the UP path.\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (3,6). This position is empty, but continuing RIGHT would soon hit the wall (column 7 is a wall), making this direction risky.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe safest and most efficient path to an apple is continuing in the current direction (UP), as it leads to the apple at (1,5) in the fewest steps without collision.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#    A #\n#AA  H #\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (row 2, column 5), with body segments at (row 3, column 5) and (row 4, column 5). The current direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). \n\nPossible directions to consider are UP, LEFT, and RIGHT:\n- **UP**: The next head position would be (row 1, column 5), which contains an apple ('A'). This move is safe (no collision with walls or self) and will result in eating the apple, increasing the score, and growing the snake.\n- **LEFT**: The next head position would be (row 2, column 4), which is empty. No apple is present here.\n- **RIGHT**: The next head position would be (row 2, column 6), which is empty. No apple is present here.\n\nMoving UP allows the snake to eat an apple, which is optimal for increasing the score. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#    H #\n#AA  S #\n#    S #\n#A   S #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe current direction is UP. The snake cannot reverse direction, so the next direction cannot be DOWN. Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- Moving UP would take the head to row 0, column 4 (a wall), causing a collision and ending the game. This is invalid.  \n- Moving RIGHT would take the head to (1,5) (empty space), which is safe. However, subsequent moves (e.g., DOWN) could lead to collisions with the snake’s body (e.g., (2,5) is an S).  \n- Moving LEFT takes the head to (1,3) (empty space), which is safe. This positions the snake to potentially move DOWN next, targeting apples at (2,2) and (2,3) in row 2.  \n\nThe safest and most strategic choice is LEFT, as it avoids immediate danger and sets up a path toward apples.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   HS #\n#AA  S #\n#    S #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and collision risks:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: Head (H) is at (row 1, column 4). Body segments (S) are at (1,5), (2,5), (3,4).\n- **Current Direction**: LEFT. The snake cannot reverse to RIGHT.\n- **Apples**: Located at (2,1), (2,2), (4,1).\n- **Collision Rules**: The game ends if the snake hits walls (#) or itself (S).\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP from (1,4) leads to (0,4), which is a wall (row 0 is the top wall). **Collision risk: High** (invalid).\n2. **RIGHT**: Reversing direction from LEFT to RIGHT is not allowed. **Invalid**.\n3. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (1,4) leads to (1,3), which is empty (no walls or body segments). **Safe but no apple**.\n4. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (1,4) leads to (2,4), which is empty (no walls or body segments). **Safe but no apple**.\n\n### Strategy:\nThe goal is to navigate toward apples while avoiding collisions. The closest apples are in row 2 (columns 1 and 2). Moving DOWN positions the snake in row 2 (column 4), allowing a direct leftward path toward these apples in subsequent moves (e.g., DOWN → LEFT → LEFT to reach (2,2), an apple). This path avoids walls and body segments.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   SS #\n#AA HS #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's position, current direction (DOWN), and the board state. The snake's head ('H') is at (row 2, column 4). The body ('S') segments are at (row 2, column 5), (row 1, column 4), and (row 1, column 3). Apples ('A') are at (row 2, column 1), (row 2, column 2), and (row 4, column 1).\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., cannot go UP from DOWN). Valid directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n- Moving RIGHT would take the head to (row 2, column 5), which is occupied by the snake's body, causing a collision. Thus, RIGHT is invalid.\n- Moving DOWN would take the head to (row 3, column 4), an empty space. This is safe but does not lead to an apple immediately.\n- Moving LEFT takes the head to (row 2, column 3), an empty space. This is safe and positions the snake to move toward the apple at (row 2, column 2) in the next epoch (since the next direction would be LEFT, allowing the head to reach the apple in the following move).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT is the best choice, as it avoids collisions, positions the snake to reach an apple in the next step, and maximizes the potential to increase the score.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   SS #\n#AAHS  #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT. The head (H) is at position (2,3) (row 2, column 3). The possible directions the snake can turn are LEFT, UP, or DOWN (since reversing to RIGHT is not allowed). \n\n- **LEFT**: The next head position would be (2,2), which is an apple (A). Moving LEFT is safe (no wall or self-collision) and will allow the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score by 1.  \n- **UP**: The next head position would be (1,3), which is a body segment (S). This would cause a self-collision, ending the game.  \n- **DOWN**: The next head position would be (3,3), which is empty. While safe, this does not eat an apple and is less optimal than moving LEFT.  \n\nThe best move is to continue moving LEFT to eat the apple. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   SS #\n#AHSS  #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current state:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at position (2, 2) (row 2, column 2).\n- Current direction: LEFT. The snake cannot reverse to RIGHT.\n- Possible directions: LEFT (continue), UP, or DOWN.\n\n### Analysis of each direction:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   Moving LEFT would take the head to (2, 1), which is an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1 and grows the snake. The new head position (2, 1) is within the board (no wall collision) and not occupied by the snake's body (no self-collision). This is safe and beneficial.\n\n2. **UP**:  \n   Moving UP would take the head to (1, 2), which is empty (no apple). This avoids collision but does not increase the score.\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   Moving DOWN would take the head to (3, 2), which is empty (no apple). This also avoids collision but does not increase the score.\n\nThe best choice is to move LEFT, as it allows the snake to eat an apple and safely grow.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#   SS #\n#HSSS  #\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Snake Position**: The snake's head ('H') is at (row 2, column 1). The body ('S') extends rightward along row 2 (columns 2-4) and upward to row 1 (columns 3-4).\n2. **Current Direction**: The snake is moving LEFT. Reversing direction (to RIGHT) is invalid.\n3. **Collision Risks**: Moving LEFT from (2,1) leads to (2,0), which is a wall (game over). Thus, LEFT is invalid.\n4. **Apple Positions**: Apples ('A') are at (3,4), (4,1), and (5,1).\n5. **Valid Directions**: Only UP or DOWN are allowed (since LEFT is invalid, and RIGHT is a reversal).\n\n### Analysis of UP:\n- Moving UP would take the head to (1,1). This is a safe, empty space (no collision). However, (1,1) is not an apple, and subsequent moves upward would hit a wall (row 0). This direction does not directly lead toward apples.\n\n### Analysis of DOWN:\n- Moving DOWN takes the head to (3,1), a safe, empty space (no collision). From (3,1), the next logical move (if direction remains DOWN) would take the head to (4,1), which is an apple. Eating this apple would grow the snake and increase the score. This direction aligns with reaching apples efficiently.\n\n### Conclusion:\nDOWN is the optimal choice, as it avoids immediate collision, positions the snake to reach an apple in the next move, and supports long-term growth.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   S  #\n#SSSS  #\n#H  A  #\n#A     #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (3, 1) (row 3, column 1) and is currently moving DOWN. The next possible moves are directions that do not reverse the current direction (so UP is invalid). \n\n- Moving LEFT would take the head to (3, 0), which is a wall (game over).  \n- Moving RIGHT would take the head to (3, 2), an empty space (no apple, no growth).  \n- Moving DOWN (current direction) takes the head to (4, 1), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple will increase the score by 1 and grow the snake.  \n\nChoosing DOWN allows the snake to eat an apple and avoid collision, making it the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   S  #\n#SSSS  #\n#SA A  #\n#H     #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction (so UP is invalid). Let's analyze possible moves:\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving left from the head's position (row 4, column 1) would take the head to (row 4, column 0), which is a wall ('#'). This causes a collision, ending the game. Invalid.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving right from (row 4, column 1) leads to (row 4, column 2), which is empty (' '). No collision, but no apple is eaten. This is safe but does not increase the score.\n- **UP**: Reversing the current direction (DOWN → UP) is not allowed. Invalid.\n- **DOWN**: Moving down from (row 4, column 1) leads to (row 5, column 1), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score by 1, grows the snake, and avoids collision. This is safe and beneficial.\n\nThe best move is to continue moving DOWN to eat the apple. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#   S  #\n#SSSS  #\n#SA A  #\n#S     #\n#H  A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is located at row 5, column 1. The current direction is DOWN, so the snake cannot reverse to UP. The possible directions to choose are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. \n\n- **LEFT**: Moving left from (5,1) would take the head to (5,0), which is a wall (row 5 starts with '#'). This would cause an immediate collision, so LEFT is invalid.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving down from (5,1) would take the head to (6,1), which is empty (no wall or body collision). However, there is no apple here, and this direction does not lead toward the nearest apple.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving right from (5,1) would take the head to (5,2), which is empty (no wall or body collision). This direction moves the head toward the apple at (5,4) (row 5, column 4), which is the closest apple. Continuing to move right in subsequent steps would allow the snake to reach and eat this apple.  \n\nThus, the safest and most optimal direction to move toward the nearest apple is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#SSSS  #\n#SA A  #\n#S     #\n#SH A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (5, 2) (row 5, column 2), and it is currently moving RIGHT.

Apples ('A') are located at (3,2), (3,4), and (5,4). \n\nThe snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n- **Moving UP**: The head would move to (4, 2), which is empty and safe. This could lead to the apple at (3,2) in the next move but requires a turn.  \n- **Moving DOWN**: The head would move to (6, 2), which is empty but does not lead directly to an apple.  \n- **Moving RIGHT**: The head moves to (5, 3), which is empty and safe. From (5, 3), the next move RIGHT would reach the apple at (5,4), allowing the snake to eat it and grow.  \n\nMoving RIGHT aligns with the current direction, avoids unnecessary turns, and directly leads to an apple in the next step. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#SSS   #\n#SA A  #\n#S     #\n#SSHA  #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 5, column 3).  \n2. **Current Direction**: RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., to LEFT).  \n3. **Apple Positions**: There is an apple 'A' at (row 5, column 4), directly to the right of the head.  \n\n### Evaluation of Possible Directions:\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (5,4), which contains an apple. Eating this apple will increase the score by 1 and allow the snake to grow. The new position (5,4) is within the board (not a wall) and not occupied by the snake’s body (the body segments are at (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)), so this move is safe.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (4,3), an empty space with no apple. This avoids collision but does not contribute to the score.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (6,3), an empty space with no apple. This also avoids collision but does not contribute to the score.  \n\nThe best move is to continue in the current direction (RIGHT) to eat the apple and grow the snake.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#SSSA  #\n#SA A  #\n#S     #\n#SSSH  #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is located at row 5, column 4 (0-indexed). The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). The possible directions to choose from are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Apple Positions**: Apples (A) are at (2,4), (3,2), and (3,4) (row, column).\n2. **Snake's Body**: The body segments (S) are at (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3).\n3. **Movement Analysis**:\n   - **RIGHT**: Next head position is (5,5) (empty, safe but no apple nearby).\n   - **DOWN**: Next head position is (6,4) (empty, safe but moves away from apples).\n   - **UP**: Next head position is (4,4) (empty, safe). Moving UP brings the snake closer to the apple at (3,4) (row 3, column 4), which can be reached in the next step by continuing UP.\n\n### Conclusion:\nChoosing UP allows the snake to approach the apple at (3,4) in the next move, maximizing the chance to eat an apple and grow. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#SS A  #\n#SA A  #\n#S  H  #\n#SSSS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is located at (row 4, column 4). The current direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). \n\nAnalyzing possible moves:\n- **UP**: Moving up takes the head to (row 3, column 4), which is an apple ('A'). This position is within the play area (no wall collision) and not part of the snake's body (no self-collision). Eating the apple will increase the score and grow the snake.\n- **LEFT**: Moving left takes the head to (row 4, column 3), which is empty. No apple, so no growth.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving right takes the head to (row 4, column 5), which is empty. No apple, so no growth.\n- **DOWN**: Reverses the current direction (UP → DOWN), which is invalid.\n\nThe optimal move is to continue moving UP to eat the apple. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# A    #\n#SS A  #\n#SA H  #\n#S  S  #\n#SSSS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and potential outcomes:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 3, column 3).\n- **Current Direction**: UP (snake is moving upward).\n- **Restrictions**: The snake cannot reverse direction (cannot choose DOWN).\n- **Apple Positions**: Apples ('A') are at (row 1, column 1), (row 2, column 4), and (row 3, column 2).\n\n### Possible Directions and Outcomes:\n1. **UP**:  \n   Moving UP would take the head to (row 2, column 3). This square is empty (no apple, no body part, no wall). The snake would not eat an apple, and the tail would shift normally. Safe but no score gain.\n\n2. **LEFT**:  \n   Moving LEFT would take the head to (row 3, column 2). This square contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple would increase the score by 1 and grow the snake (tail does not shrink). The square (row 3, column 2) is not occupied by the snake's body ('S') or a wall, so this move is safe.\n\n3. **RIGHT**:  \n   Moving RIGHT would take the head to (row 3, column 4). This square is empty (no apple, no body part, no wall). The snake would not eat an apple, and the tail would shift normally. Safe but no score gain.\n\n### Best Move:\nMoving LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple, increasing the score, while avoiding collisions. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# A    #\n#S  A  #\n#SAHS  #\n#S  S  #\n#SSSS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, we analyze the current state:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at position (row 3, column 3).\n- Current direction is LEFT, so the snake cannot reverse to RIGHT. Possible directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN.\n- Moving LEFT: The next head position is (3, 2), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score, grows the snake, and avoids collision (no walls or body segments here).\n- Moving UP: The next head position is (2, 3), an empty space with no apple.\n- Moving DOWN: The next head position is (4, 3), an empty space with no apple.\n\nMoving LEFT is optimal as it allows the snake to eat an apple safely.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n# A   A#\n#S  A  #\n#SHSS  #\n#S  S  #\n#SSSS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Position & Direction**: The snake's head ('H') is at row 3, column 2 (row\/column indices start at 0). The current direction is LEFT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid).\n\n2. **Collision Checks**:\n   - **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (3,2) would take the head to (3,1), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This causes a self-collision, so LEFT is invalid.\n   - **RIGHT**: Reversing direction (LEFT → RIGHT) is not allowed, so RIGHT is invalid.\n   - **UP**: Moving UP from (3,2) takes the head to (2,2). This cell is empty (no wall or body), so it is safe.\n   - **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (3,2) takes the head to (4,2). This cell is empty (no wall or body), so it is safe.\n\n3. **Apple Strategy**: The apples are at (1,1), (1,4), and (2,4). Moving UP to (2,2) positions the snake closer to the apple at (2,4) (reachable by subsequent RIGHT moves), whereas moving DOWN to (4,2) does not directly align with an apple. Thus, UP is more optimal for future apple collection.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n# A   A#\n# H A  #\n#SSSS  #\n#S  S  #\n#SSSS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, we analyze the current game state:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at (row 2, column 2).\n- Current direction is UP, so the snake cannot reverse to DOWN. Possible directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n- Apples ('A') are at (row 1, column 2), (row 1, column 5), and (row 2, column 4).\n- The snake's body ('S') occupies positions: (3,1-4), (4,1), (4,4), (5,1-4).\n\n**Analysis of directions:**\n- **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (row 1, column 2), which contains an apple. This position is not a wall or body segment, so it is safe. Eating the apple increases the score and grows the snake.\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (row 2, column 1), which is empty (no apple) and safe. No score increase.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (row 2, column 3), which is empty (no apple) and safe. No score increase.\n\nThe optimal choice is UP, as it allows the snake to eat an apple safely.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# H   A#\n# S A  #\n#SSSS  #\n#SA S  #\n#SSSS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (1,2) (row 1, column 2) and is currently moving UP. The snake cannot reverse direction, so possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (0,2), which is a wall (row 0 is entirely walls). This causes a collision, ending the game.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (1,1). While (1,1) is empty now, the next possible moves from (1,1) (LEFT, UP, or DOWN) would lead to walls (LEFT: (1,0) is a wall; UP: (0,1) is a wall) or the snake's body (DOWN: (2,1) is an 'S'), resulting in a collision in the next step.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (1,3), which is empty. From (1,3), continuing RIGHT allows the snake to move toward the apple at (1,6) (positions (1,4), (1,5), then (1,6)), avoiding walls and body collisions. This path is safe and leads to an apple.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# SH  A#\n# S A  #\n# SSS  #\n#SA S  #\n#SSSS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (1, 3) (row 1, column 3), and the current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so LEFT is invalid. \n\n### Analysis of possible directions:\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (0, 3), which is a wall ('#'). This causes a collision, ending the game. **Invalid**.\n- **LEFT**: Reversing direction from RIGHT to LEFT is not allowed. **Invalid**.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (1, 4), which is a safe empty space. However, there is no apple here, and this direction does not directly approach the nearest apple.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (2, 3), a safe empty space. From (2, 3), the next move (if direction is RIGHT) can reach the apple at (2, 4) in the following step. This is the shortest path to an apple.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN allows the snake to approach the nearest apple at (2, 4) efficiently, avoiding walls and self-collision.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n# SS  A#\n# SHA  #\n# SSS  #\n# A S  #\n#SSSS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (row 2, column 3) on the board. The current direction is DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction (so UP is invalid). \n\n- **Moving DOWN**: The head would move to (row 3, column 3), which is occupied by the snake's body (S), causing a collision. This is invalid.  \n- **Moving LEFT**: The head would move to (row 2, column 2), which is occupied by the snake's body (S), causing a collision. This is invalid.  \n- **Moving RIGHT**: The head would move to (row 2, column 4), which contains an apple (A). This is safe, allows the snake to eat the apple, and avoids collision.  \n\nThus, the only valid and optimal direction is RIGHT. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# SS  A#\n# SSH  #\n# SSS  #\n# A S  #\n#SSSS  #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (2,4) (row 2, column 4), and the current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). We need to check possible directions (UP, RIGHT, DOWN) for safety and apple proximity.\n\n### Analysis of Directions:\n- **DOWN**: Next head position would be (3,4), which is occupied by the snake's body (S). This causes a collision, so DOWN is invalid.  \n- **LEFT**: Reverse of the current direction (RIGHT), so it is invalid.  \n- **RIGHT**: Next head position is (2,5). This cell is empty (no wall or body), so it is safe. No apple is present here.  \n- **UP**: Next head position is (1,4). This cell is empty (no wall or body), so it is safe. No apple is present here.  \n\n### Choosing the Best Direction:\nThe goal is to eat apples. The nearest apple is at (1,6) (row 1, column 6). Moving UP to (1,4) positions the head in the same row as this apple, allowing a direct path (RIGHT, RIGHT) to reach the apple in subsequent moves. This is more favorable than continuing RIGHT, which would require an extra step (UP) to reach the apple.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n# SSH A#\n# SSS  #\n# SSS  #\n# A S  #\n# SSS  #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is located at row 1, column 4. The current direction is UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). \n\n- Moving UP would take the head to row 0, column 4, which is a wall (collision → game over).\n- Moving LEFT would take the head to row 1, column 3, which is 'S' (snake's body → collision → game over).\n- Moving RIGHT would take the head to row 1, column 5, which is empty (safe).\n- Moving DOWN is invalid (reverse of current direction UP).\n\nThe only safe direction is RIGHT. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n# SSSHA#\n# SSS  #\n# SSS  #\n# A S  #\n#  SS  #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current state:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at position (1,4) (row 1, column 4, with rows and columns indexed from 0).\n- Current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid).\n- Possible directions to consider: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n### Analysis of each direction:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (0,4). Row 0 is a wall (all '#'), so this would cause a collision. **Invalid**.\n2. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (2,4). This cell is empty (no wall or snake body), so it is safe. However, there is no apple here, so no score increase.\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT (current direction) takes the head to (1,5). This cell contains an apple ('A'). The cell is not a wall or snake body, so it is safe. Eating the apple will increase the score by 1 and grow the snake.\n\nThe safest and most beneficial move is to continue moving RIGHT, as it allows the snake to eat an apple without collision.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n# SSSSH#\n# SSS  #\n# SSS  #\n# A S A#\n#  SS  #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT, and the snake's head (H) is at position (1,5). Moving RIGHT would take the head to (1,6), which is a wall, causing a collision. The snake cannot reverse direction (LEFT is invalid). Moving UP would take the head to (0,5), also a wall. The only valid direction is DOWN, which moves the head to (2,5), an empty space with no collision.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# SSS H#\n# SSS  #\n# A S A#\n#   S  #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (2,4) (row 2, column 4), and the current direction is DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction, so UP is invalid. We need to evaluate the remaining options (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN) for safety and apple proximity.\n\n### Analysis of Directions:\n1. **LEFT**: New head position would be (2,3). This cell is occupied by the snake's body ('S'), causing a collision. **Invalid**.\n2. **RIGHT**: New head position is (2,5). This cell is empty (' '), so no collision. Moving right allows the snake to head toward the apple at (4,5) (row 4, column 5) in subsequent moves (e.g., down to (3,5), then down to (4,5)). **Safe**.\n3. **DOWN**: New head position is (3,4). This cell is empty (' '), so no collision. Moving down also allows the snake to approach the apple at (4,5) (e.g., down to (4,4), then right to (4,5)). **Safe**.\n\n### Priority:\nBoth RIGHT and DOWN are safe, but RIGHT directly positions the snake closer to the apple at (4,5) in the next steps, making it the better choice.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Moving UP:  \nNext head position: (3, 3). This square is empty (no apple). The snake moves up but gains no score.  \n\n#### 2. Moving RIGHT:  \nNext head position: (4, 4). This square is empty (no apple). The snake moves right but gains no score.  \n\n#### 3. Moving LEFT:  \nNext head position: (4, 2). This square is empty (no apple). However, this sets up a strategic path:  \n- After moving LEFT, the snake’s new direction is LEFT. In the next epoch, the snake can move DOWN (allowed, as LEFT → DOWN is not a reversal).  \n- From (4, 2), moving DOWN would take the head to (5, 2), which is an apple. This allows the snake to eat the apple in the next move, increasing the score.  \n\n#### 4. Moving DOWN:  \nInvalid (reverse of current direction UP).  \n\n### Optimal Choice:  \nMoving LEFT positions the snake to reach an apple in the next epoch.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# H    #\n#AA    #\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (row 4, column 2) with a current direction of LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT. \n\n- **LEFT**: Moving left would take the head to (4, 1), which is a safe empty space but contains no apple.  \n- **UP**: Moving up would take the head to (3, 2), which is a safe empty space but contains no apple.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving down would take the head to (5, 2), which is occupied by an apple ('A'). Eating this apple would increase the score by 1, grow the snake's length, and update the board with the new head at (5, 2) and the previous head position (4, 2) becoming a body segment ('S').  \n\nChoosing DOWN allows the snake to eat an apple, which is optimal for maximizing the score. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S A  #\n#AH    #\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is located at row 5, column 2. The current direction is DOWN, so the snake cannot reverse to UP. Possible directions to move are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. \n\n- **LEFT**: Moving left from (5,2) leads to (5,1), which contains an apple ('A'). This would allow the snake to eat the apple, increase the score by 1, and grow in length. The new head position (5,1) is within the board (no wall collision) and does not collide with the snake's body (current body is at (4,2)). This is a safe and beneficial move.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving right from (5,2) leads to (5,3), which is empty space. The snake would not eat an apple, and the move is safe but provides no immediate benefit.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving down from (5,2) leads to (6,2), which is empty space. The snake would not eat an apple, and the move is safe but provides no immediate benefit.  \n\nThe optimal choice is to move LEFT to eat the apple and grow the snake. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S A  #\n#HS    #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (row 5, column 1). The current direction is LEFT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). \n\n- **Moving LEFT**: The next position would be (5, 0), which is a wall (column 0 is a wall). This causes a wall collision, ending the game.  \n- **Moving UP**: The next position would be (4, 1). Row 4, column 1 contains 'S' (snake's body), causing a self-collision, ending the game.  \n- **Moving RIGHT**: Reverse of the current direction (LEFT → RIGHT), which is not allowed.  \n- **Moving DOWN**: The next position is (6, 1), which contains an apple ('A'). This is safe (no wall or self-collision), and the snake will eat the apple, grow, and increase the score.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S A  #\n#SS    #\n#H  A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (6,1) (row 6, column 1). The current direction is DOWN, and the snake cannot reverse direction (UP is invalid). Checking possible moves:\n- **DOWN**: Would move to (7,1), which is a wall (game over).\n- **UP**: Would move to (5,1), which is part of the snake's body (self-collision, game over).\n- **LEFT**: Would move to (6,0), which is a wall (game over).\n- **RIGHT**: Would move to (6,2), which is an empty space (safe).\n\nThe only valid move is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#SS    #\n#SH A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (6, 2) (row 6, column 2). The current direction is RIGHT, so the snake cannot reverse to LEFT. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (5, 2). Row 5, column 2 contains 'S' (part of the snake's body), causing a self-collision. This is invalid.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (7, 2). Row 7 is a wall ('#'), causing a wall collision. This is invalid.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (6, 3), which is an empty space (' '). No collision occurs, and the move is safe.  \n\nThe only valid direction is RIGHT. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#S     #\n#SSHA  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (6,3) (row 6, column 3). The current direction is RIGHT, so the snake cannot reverse to LEFT. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (7,3), which is a wall (row 7 is all '#'). This causes a collision, so DOWN is invalid.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (5,3), which is empty (no wall or snake body). This is safe but does not eat an apple.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (6,4), which is an 'A' (apple). This is within the board (not a wall) and not part of the snake's body. Eating the apple increases the score and grows the snake safely.  \n\nThe best choice is to move RIGHT to eat the apple and avoid immediate danger. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#A  A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#S     #\n#SSSH  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (6,4) (row 6, column 4). The current direction is RIGHT, so the snake cannot reverse to LEFT. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n- **DOWN**: Moving down would take the head to (7,4), which is a wall (row 7 is the bottom wall). This causes a collision, ending the game.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving right takes the head to (6,5), an empty space. No apple is present here, and no collision occurs.  \n- **UP**: Moving up takes the head to (5,4), an empty space. No collision occurs, and this direction moves the snake toward the apple at (4,3) (row 4, column 3), which is a strategic path to reach an apple in future moves.  \n\nSince DOWN is invalid (wall collision), and UP is safer and more strategic for reaching an apple, the best choice is UP.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A  A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#   H  #\n#SSSS  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and goals:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: Head ('H') is at (row 5, column 3). Body ('S') occupies (row 6, columns 1-4).\n- **Current Direction**: UP (snake cannot reverse to DOWN).\n- **Apples**: Located at (row 1, column 1), (row 1, column 4), and (row 4, column 3).\n- **Goal**: Eat apples to increase score and avoid collisions.\n\n### Possible Moves:\n1. **UP**: The snake moves to (row 4, column 3). This cell contains an apple ('A'). Eating it increases the score by 1, grows the snake, and avoids collisions (no walls or body segments here).\n2. **LEFT**: The snake moves to (row 5, column 2). This cell is empty (no apple), so no growth. Safe but no score gain.\n3. **RIGHT**: The snake moves to (row 5, column 4). This cell is empty (no apple), so no growth. Safe but no score gain.\n\n### Optimal Choice:\nMoving UP directly targets the apple at (row 4, column 3), which is the only move that increases the score. All other moves do not eat an apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#A  A  #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#   H  #\n#   S  #\n#SSSS  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (4,3) (row 4, column 3), and the current direction is UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (3,3). This position is empty (no wall or self-collision). From (3,3), the snake can then move LEFT to (3,2) and again LEFT to (3,1), which contains an apple. This path allows the snake to reach an apple in the next two epochs.\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (4,2). However, continuing LEFT from (4,2) would lead to (4,1) and then (4,0) (a wall), which is dangerous.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (4,4). While safe, this path does not directly lead to an apple as quickly as moving UP.\n\nThe optimal choice is to continue moving UP, as it positions the snake to reach an apple at (3,1) in subsequent moves without risk of collision.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A  A  #\n#      #\n#A  H  #\n#   S  #\n#   S  #\n# SSS  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, available moves, and apple positions. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The head ('H') is at (row 3, column 4). The body ('S') segments are at (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2).\n- **Current Direction**: UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid).\n- **Apples**: Located at (1,1), (1,4), and (3,1).\n- **Goal**: Move toward an apple while avoiding self-collision or walls.\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (2,4). This position is empty (no body or wall collision). Continuing UP from (2,4) in the next step would reach (1,4), which contains an apple. This path safely leads to an apple in two steps (current move + next move).\n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (3,3). This position is empty, but reaching the nearest apple (3,1) would require two additional LEFT moves (to (3,2) then (3,1)), taking three steps total.\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (3,5). This position is empty but does not lead to an apple in the immediate steps.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP is optimal because it directly leads toward the apple at (1,4) in the fewest steps (two steps total) without risk of collision.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A  A  #\n#   H  #\n#A  S  #\n#   S  #\n#   S  #\n#  SS  #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving UP, and the goal is to choose a direction (UP, LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN) that avoids collisions and maximizes apple consumption. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Current Head Position**: The snake’s head (H) is at (row 2, column 3).\n2. **Apples**: Apples (A) are at (row 1, column 1), (row 1, column 4), and (row 3, column 1).\n3. **Body Segments (S)**: The snake’s body is at (row 3, column 4), (row 4, column 4), (row 5, column 4), (row 6, column 2), and (row 6, column 3).\n4. **Movement Constraints**: The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., cannot switch from UP to DOWN). Current direction is UP, so DOWN is invalid. Valid directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Directions:\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (row 1, column 3). This cell is empty (no walls or body segments). From here, a subsequent RIGHT move would reach the apple at (row 1, column 4) in the next step. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (row 2, column 2). This cell is empty. From here, reaching the nearest apple (row 1, column 1) would require additional steps (LEFT then UP), making it slower than other options.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (row 2, column 4). This cell is empty (no walls or body segments). From here, a subsequent UP move would directly reach the apple at (row 1, column 4) in the next step. Safe and efficient.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT allows the snake to position itself one step away from the nearest apple (row 1, column 4), enabling it to eat the apple in the next move. This is the most efficient path.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A  A  #\n#   SH #\n#A  S  #\n#   S  #\n#   S  #\n#   S  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (2,4) (row 2, column 4), and the current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). Let's analyze possible moves:\n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (1,4). Checking row 1, column 4 is an apple ('A'). This position is within the board (not a wall) and not occupied by the snake's body (the body segments are at (2,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4)). Moving UP is safe, and the snake would eat the apple, increasing the score and growing.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (3,4), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This causes a collision, ending the game.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (2,5), which is empty (no apple, no collision). The snake moves safely but does not eat an apple.  \n\nThe best choice is UP, as it allows the snake to eat an apple without collision. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A  AH #\n#   SS #\n#A  S  #\n#   S  #\n#   S  #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (1,5) (row 1, column 5). The current direction is UP, so the snake cannot reverse to DOWN. The possible directions to choose are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (0,5), which is a wall (row 0 is all '#'). This causes a collision, ending the game. This is invalid.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (1,4). Checking the board, (1,4) contains an apple ('A'). This position is not occupied by the snake's body (S's are at (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4)). Eating the apple is safe and increases the score.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (1,6), which is a safe empty space but contains no apple. This does not improve the score.  \n\nThe optimal choice is to move LEFT to eat the apple and grow the snake. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#A  HS #\n#   SS #\n#A  S  #\n#   S  #\n#A  S  #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Position**: The head ('H') is at (row 1, column 4).

Thus, valid directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN.\n   - **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (row 0, column 4), which is a wall ('#'). Colliding with the wall ends the game. **Invalid**.\n   - **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (row 2, column 4), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). Colliding with the body ends the game. **Invalid**.\n   - **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (row 1, column 3), which is an empty space (' ').

The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). Let's analyze the possible moves:\n\n1. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (0,3), which is a wall (#). This causes a collision, ending the game. Invalid.  \n2. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (2,3). This cell is empty (no wall or self-collision), but there is no apple here. The snake would not grow, and the tail would shift.  \n3. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (1,2). This cell is empty (no collision), and the next move (if LEFT is maintained) would reach (1,1), which contains an apple ('A'). This path allows the snake to eat an apple in the next epoch, increasing the score and growing the snake.  \n\nThe optimal choice is to continue moving LEFT to reach the apple in the next step.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#AHSSS #\n#   SS #\n#A  S  #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (1,2) (row 1, column 2). The current direction is LEFT, meaning the snake is moving left. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). \n\nAnalyzing possible directions:\n- **UP**: Moving up would take the head to (0,2), which is a wall ('#'). This causes a collision, ending the game. Invalid.\n- **DOWN**: Moving down would take the head to (2,2), which is empty. No collision, but no apple is eaten. Neutral move.\n- **LEFT**: Moving left takes the head to (1,1), which contains an apple ('A'). This is safe (no wall or body collision), and the snake will eat the apple, grow, and increase the score. \n\nThe optimal choice is to continue moving LEFT to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#HSSSS #\n#   SS #\n#A  S  #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT. Let's analyze possible directions:\n\n1. **LEFT**: The head is at (1,1). Moving LEFT would take it to (1,0), which is a wall (row 1 starts with '#'). This causes a wall collision, ending the game. Invalid.\n   \n2. **RIGHT**: Reversing direction (LEFT → RIGHT) is not allowed per the rules. Invalid.\n   \n3. **UP**: The head at (1,1) moving UP would go to (0,1), which is a wall (row 0 is all '#'). Wall collision. Invalid.\n   \n4. **DOWN**: The head at (1,1) moving DOWN goes to (2,1). Checking (2,1) on row 2 (\"#   SS #\"), this position is a space (not a wall or snake body). No collision.

Reversing direction (to UP) is not allowed.\n3. **Possible Directions**: LEFT, RIGHT, or continuing DOWN.\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (2,0), which is a wall (row 2 starts with '#'). This causes an immediate collision with the wall, ending the game. **Invalid**.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (2,2), an empty space. No apple is present here, so the snake does not grow, and the tail would shift forward. This avoids collision but does not increase the score. **Safe but no apple**.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (3,1), which contains an apple ('A'). This is within the board (no wall collision) and not occupied by the snake's body (no self-collision). Eating the apple increases the score by 1 and grows the snake. **Safe and rewards an apple**.\n\nThe best choice is to continue moving DOWN to eat the apple and avoid collision.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SSSSS #\n#S  SS #\n#H     #\n#      #\n#A  A A#\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The head ('H') is at row 3, column 1.

The snake cannot reverse direction (UP is invalid).\n- **Apples**: Located at row 5, columns 1, 4, and 5 (positions (5,1), (5,4), (5,5)).\n- **Collision Rules**: The snake loses if it hits walls (marked '#') or its own body ('S').\n\n### Evaluating Possible Directions:\n1. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (3,1) would take the head to (3,0), which is a wall ('#'). This causes an immediate collision. **Invalid**.\n2. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (3,1) takes the head to (3,2), a safe empty space. However, this direction moves the snake horizontally away from the closest apple at (5,1) and offers no immediate path to apples. **Suboptimal**.\n3. **UP**: Reversing direction from DOWN to UP is not allowed. **Invalid**.\n4. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (3,1) takes the head to (4,1), a safe empty space. This direction directly progresses toward the closest apple at (5,1) (row 5, column 1). Continuing DOWN in subsequent moves will reach this apple, increasing the score. **Safe and optimal**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN is the safest and most efficient direction to reach an apple while avoiding collisions.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#SSSSS #\n#S   S #\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#A  A A#\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, analyze the current game state:\n\n- **Snake Position**: Head ('H') is at (4,1).

Safe move.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOnly LEFT is a valid, safe direction that avoids collisions.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#S  AA #\n#SSSSSS#\n#HSSSSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (6,1) (row 6, column 1), and the current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). We need to check valid directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT) for collisions:\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving left would take the head to (6,0), which is a wall (row 6 starts with '#'). Collision → invalid.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving down would take the head to (7,1), which is a wall (row 7 is all '#'). Collision → invalid.  \n- **UP**: Moving up takes the head to (5,1). Before moving, (5,1) is part of the snake's body, but when the snake moves, the tail (at (4,1)) is removed, and body segments shift forward. The new body segments after moving UP will be (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2). None of these include (5,1), so the head at (5,1) is safe. No collision.  \n\nThus, the only valid direction to avoid immediate collision is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is not allowed). The goal is to move toward an apple to maximize the score. \n\nThe apples are located at (row 2, column 4), (row 6, column 3), and (row 6, column 5). The closest apple is at (row 2, column 4). To reach this apple, the snake should move toward it. \n\nIf the snake moves RIGHT (current direction is UP, so RIGHT is allowed), the head will move to (row 4, column 4). From there, moving UP twice will reach (row 2, column 4), where the apple is located. This path is efficient and avoids walls or self-collision. \n\nOther directions (UP or LEFT) either move away from the closest apple or do not align as well with the apple's position.

The snake's head (H) is at (row 4, column 3), moving RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). The goal is to reach an apple safely.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (row 2, column 3), (row 6, column 2), and (row 6, column 4).\n2. **Current Direction**: RIGHT. Possible valid directions are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT.\n3. **Safety Check**: All three directions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) are initially safe (no walls or self-collisions).\n\n### Direction Analysis:\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (4, 4). This position is empty (no apple), and the snake continues moving RIGHT. The closest apple from (4, 4) is (6, 4), requiring two additional DOWN moves.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (5, 3). This position is empty, and the closest apples (6, 2) or (6, 4) require two additional moves (LEFT\/RIGHT + DOWN).\n- **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (3, 3). This position is empty, but the next move (continuing UP) would reach (2, 3), which contains an apple. This path reaches an apple in two steps (current move UP, next move UP).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP is optimal, as it directly leads the snake toward the closest apple (row 2, column 3) in the fewest steps.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, we analyze the snake's current state. The snake's head (H) is at position (row 3, column 3), and the current direction is UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., cannot turn to DOWN from UP). \n\n- **Moving UP**: The next position is (row 2, column 3), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple will increase the score by 1 and grow the snake. This move is safe (no collision with walls or self).  \n- **Moving LEFT**: The next position is (row 3, column 2), which is empty (' '). This move is safe but does not collect an apple.  \n- **Moving RIGHT**: The next position is (row 3, column 4), which is empty (' '). This move is safe but does not collect an apple.  \n- **Moving DOWN**: This is a reverse of the current direction (UP → DOWN), which is invalid.  \n\nThe optimal choice is to move UP, as it allows the snake to eat an apple and grow, maximizing the score. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#   HA #\n#   S  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and goals:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The snake's head ('H') is at (row 2, column 3), and its body ('S') is at (row 3, column 3).\n- **Current Direction**: The snake is moving UP. It cannot reverse direction (e.g., cannot turn directly to DOWN).\n- **Apples**: There are 3 apples on the board: one at (row 2, column 4), and two at (row 6, columns 2 and 4).\n- **Goal**: Eat apples to increase the score and avoid collisions with walls or the snake's body.\n\n### Possible Directions (Valid Moves):\nThe snake can turn to UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (since reversing to DOWN is invalid).\n\n#### 1. Direction: UP\n- New head position: (row 1, column 3). This square is empty (no apple, no collision). The snake moves but gains no score.\n\n#### 2. Direction: LEFT\n- New head position: (row 2, column 2). This square is empty (no apple, no collision). The snake moves but gains no score.\n\n#### 3. Direction: RIGHT\n- New head position: (row 2, column 4). This square contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score by 1 and grows the snake. \n- After eating, the snake's new segments will be: head at (row 2, column 4), body at (row 2, column 3) (previous head), and body at (row 3, column 3) (previous body). No collisions occur.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple, increasing the score and growing the snake. This is the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#   SH #\n#   S  #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and future safety:\n\n### Current State:\n- **Snake Head (H) Position**: (Row 2, Column 4) (0-indexed).\n- **Snake Body (S) Positions**: (Row 2, Column 3) and (Row 3, Column 3).\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT.\n- **Apples (A) Positions**: (Row 4, Column 2), (Row 6, Column 2), (Row 6, Column 4).\n\n### Valid Moves (Cannot reverse direction, so LEFT is invalid):\n1. **RIGHT**: Next head position = (Row 2, Column 5).  \n   - Safe (no wall\/body collision), but no apple here.  \n   - Risk: If the snake continues RIGHT next epoch, it will hit the right wall (Column 6 is a wall).  \n\n2. **UP**: Next head position = (Row 1, Column 4).  \n   - Safe (no wall\/body collision), but no apple here.  \n   - Risk: Moving UP again next epoch would hit the top wall (Row 0 is a wall).  \n\n3. **DOWN**: Next head position = (Row 3, Column 4).  \n   - Safe (no wall\/body collision), but no apple here.  \n   - Advantage: Moving DOWN allows the snake to head toward the apple at (Row 6, Column 4) in subsequent moves (e.g., (Row 4, Column 4) → (Row 5, Column 4) → (Row 6, Column 4)), avoiding walls and body collisions.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN is the safest and most strategic choice, as it avoids immediate risks and positions the snake to reach an apple in future epochs.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#   SS #\n#    H #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, available moves, and apple positions. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 3, column 4). The body 'S' segments are at (row 2, column 3) and (row 2, column 4). The snake’s length is 3.\n- **Current Direction**: DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction (so UP is invalid). Valid directions: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n- **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (row 4, column 3), (row 6, column 2), and (row 6, column 4). The closest apple is at (row 4, column 3).\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **Moving DOWN**:  \n   The head would move to (row 4, column 4). This position is empty (no collision with walls or self). From here, the next move could be LEFT to reach (row 4, column 3) (the closest apple).  \n\n2. **Moving LEFT**:  \n   The head would move to (row 3, column 3). This position is empty (no collision). From here, the next move could be DOWN to reach (row 4, column 3) (the closest apple).  \n\n3. **Moving RIGHT**:  \n   The head would move to (row 3, column 5), which is empty but farther from the nearest apple. This is suboptimal.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth LEFT and DOWN are safe, but moving LEFT directly positions the snake closer to the nearest apple (row 4, column 3) in the next step. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#    S #\n#   HS #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Current State:\n- **Snake Head (H)**: Position (row 3, column 3) (row 3: \"#   HS #\").\n- **Snake Body (S)**: Segments at (row 3, column 4) and (row 2, column 4) (row 3: \"HS\" and row 2: \"S\").\n- **Apples (A)**: Positions (row 4, column 3) (row 4: \"#  A   #\"), (row 6, column 3), and (row 6, column 5) (row 6: \"#  A A #\").\n- **Current Direction**: LEFT (snake is moving left).\n- **Constraints**: Cannot reverse direction (reverse of LEFT is RIGHT, so RIGHT is invalid).\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **LEFT (Current Direction)**:  \n   Next head position: (row 3, column 2). This is a valid, empty space (no wall or self-collision). No apple here. The snake moves but does not grow.\n\n2. **UP**:  \n   Next head position: (row 2, column 3). This is a valid, empty space (no wall or self-collision). No apple here. The snake moves but does not grow.\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   Next head position: (row 4, column 3). This position contains an apple (\"A\"). Moving here will allow the snake to eat the apple, increase the score by 1, and grow in length. No wall or self-collision occurs here (body segments are at (row 3, column 4) and (row 2, column 4), which do not overlap with (row 4, column 3)).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving **DOWN** is optimal because it allows the snake to eat an apple, grow, and increase the score. Other directions do not lead to apples.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SS #\n#  AH  #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and safety:\n\n### Current State:\n- **Snake Head (H) Position**: (Row 4, Column 4).\n- **Snake Body (S) Positions**: (Row 3, Column 4) and (Row 3, Column 5).\n- **Current Direction**: DOWN (snake cannot reverse to UP).\n- **Apples (A)**: At (Row 4, Column 3), (Row 6, Column 3), and (Row 6, Column 5).\n\n### Possible Moves:\n1. **DOWN (Current Direction)**:  \n   The head moves to (Row 5, Column 4). This cell is empty, and no collision with walls or the snake’s body occurs. However, no apple is eaten.\n\n2. **LEFT**:  \n   The head moves to (Row 4, Column 3), which contains an apple. Eating this apple increases the score by 1 and grows the snake. The new head position (Row 4, Column 3) is not occupied by the snake’s body, so no collision occurs. This move is valid (LEFT is not a reversal of DOWN).\n\n3. **RIGHT**:  \n   The head moves to (Row 4, Column 5). This cell is empty, and no collision occurs. However, no apple is eaten.\n\n### Optimal Choice:\nMoving LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, increasing the score and growing the snake. This is the best option.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SS #\n#  HS  #\n#      #\n#A A A #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (4,2) (row 4, column 2), moving LEFT. The snake's body segments are at (4,3), (3,4), and (3,5). The apples are at (6,1), (6,3), and (6,5) (row 6). The goal is to direct the snake toward an apple while avoiding collisions.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Directions:\n- **LEFT**: The head would move to (4,1) (safe, as this cell is empty). This moves the snake left but not closer to the apples in row 6.  \n- **UP**: The head would move to (3,2) (safe, as this cell is empty). This moves the snake upward, away from the apples in row 6.  \n- **DOWN**: The head would move to (5,2) (safe, as this cell is empty). This moves the snake downward, directly toward the apples in row 6.  \n\n### Optimal Choice:\nMoving DOWN is the best option because it directs the snake toward the apples in row 6. Subsequent moves can continue downward to reach row 6 and then adjust direction to reach an apple (e.g., (6,3) or (6,1)). \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   S  #\n#  SS  #\n#  H   #\n#A A A #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at row 5, column 2. The current direction is DOWN, and the snake cannot reverse to UP. Possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. \n\n- **Moving DOWN**: The head moves to row 6, column 2 (empty space, no collision). This positions the head between apples at (6,1) and (6,3), allowing the next move to eat an apple by turning LEFT or RIGHT.  \n- **Moving LEFT**: The head moves to row 5, column 1 (empty space, no collision). The next move DOWN would reach the apple at (6,1).  \n- **Moving RIGHT**: The head moves to row 5, column 3 (empty space, no collision). The next move DOWN would reach the apple at (6,3).  \n\nAll directions are safe, but continuing DOWN keeps the snake aligned with its current path and positions it to easily reach either of two apples in the next epoch. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   S  #\n#  SS  #\n#  S   #\n#A H AA#\n########\n\nTo determine the next direction, we analyze the snake's current state, position, and possible moves:\n\n1. **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at row 6, column 3 (coordinates: (6, 3)).\n2. **Current Direction**: The snake is moving DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction, so moving UP (the opposite of DOWN) is invalid.\n3. **Possible Directions**: The valid directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continuing DOWN (but DOWN leads to a wall, which is a collision). Thus, only LEFT and RIGHT are viable.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Moves:\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to row 7, column 3. Row 7 is a wall, causing an immediate collision. This is invalid.\n- **UP**: Reversing direction (from DOWN to UP) is not allowed per game rules. Invalid.\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (6, 2). This cell is empty (no wall or snake body), so it is safe but does not contain an apple.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (6, 4). This cell contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score by 1, and the snake grows in length. The cell (6, 4) is not part of the snake's body (current body segments are at (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 3)), so this move is safe and beneficial.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple, increase the score, and avoid collision.

This cell contains an 'A' (apple). Eating the apple will increase the score by 1 and grow the snake. The new head position (6,5) is within the board (no wall collision) and does not overlap with the snake's body (body segments are at (4,2), (4,3), (5,2), (6,3)), so this move is safe.\n\n2. **UP**: Moving up from (6,4) leads to (5,4). This cell is empty (no apple) and safe (no wall or self-collision), but it does not provide a score increase.\n\n3. **DOWN**: Moving down from (6,4) leads to (7,4), which is a wall (row 7 is all '#'). This would cause a wall collision, ending the game. Thus, DOWN is invalid.\n\nThe best move is RIGHT, as it safely eats an apple and increases the score.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SS  #\n#A S   #\n#A SSHA#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game board, snake position, and movement constraints:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head ('H') is at (row 6, column 4).\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT (snake cannot reverse to LEFT).\n- **Apples**: Apples ('A') are at (6,1), (5,1), and (6,5).\n- **Snake Body**: Body segments ('S') are at (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,2), (6,3).\n\n### Possible Directions and Outcomes:\n1. **RIGHT (Current Direction)**:  \n   The next head position would be (6,5), which contains an apple ('A'). Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score by 1 and growing the snake. No collision occurs (no walls or body segments at (6,5)).  \n\n2. **UP**:  \n   The next head position would be (5,4), an empty cell (' '). No apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow. This is safe but does not improve the score.  \n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   The next head position would be (7,4), which is a wall ('#'). Moving DOWN causes an immediate collision, ending the game.  \n\n4. **LEFT**:  \n   Reversing the current direction (RIGHT → LEFT) is invalid per game rules.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple, grow, and avoid collision.

This cell is empty (no wall or body collision). This direction allows the snake to move toward row 3, where an apple is located at (3,3). Further leftward movement from (4,6) can eventually reach the apple at (3,3) without colliding with the body.\n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (5,6) leads to (5,5) (empty). However, continuing LEFT would eventually reach (5,3), which is a body segment (collision risk).\n3. **RIGHT**: Invalid, as (5,7) is a wall.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP is the safest and most strategic choice, as it avoids immediate collisions and positions the snake to approach the apple at (3,3) in subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#     H#\n#A S  S#\n#A SSSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (4,5) (row 4, column 5).\n- **Current Direction**: UP (snake is moving upward).\n- **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (3,2), (5,1), and (6,1).\n- **Body Positions**: Body segments 'S' are at (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6).\n- **Collision Rules**: The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., UP → DOWN is invalid) and loses if it hits walls or its own body.\n\n### Possible Moves:\nThe snake can only choose UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (DOWN is a reverse of UP and invalid).\n\n1. **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (3,5). This position is empty (no collision with walls or body) and is a step toward the apple at (3,2) (row 3, column 2). This path keeps the snake moving toward the nearest apple.\n   \n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (4,4). This position is empty but does not directly approach any apple. It would require additional turns to reach an apple, delaying progress.\n   \n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (4,6). This position is empty but is adjacent to the wall (column 7). Continuing RIGHT could quickly lead to a wall collision, making this a risky choice.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP is the safest and most strategic choice, as it progresses toward the apple at (3,2) without risking collisions.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A  H#\n#     S#\n#A    S#\n#A SSSS#\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving UP, and the possible next directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (since reversing to DOWN is not allowed). \n\n- **Moving UP**: The head (at row 3, column 5) would move to row 2, column 5. This position is empty (no walls or body segments), but there is no apple here.  \n- **Moving LEFT**: The head would move to row 3, column 4. This position is empty (no walls or body segments). The next logical move (continuing LEFT) would reach row 3, column 3, which contains an apple ('A'). This path safely leads toward an apple.  \n- **Moving RIGHT**: The head would move to row 3, column 6. This position is empty (no walls or body segments), but there are no apples in this direction.  \n\nTo maximize apple consumption, the optimal choice is to move LEFT, as it directly approaches the nearest apple at (3,3).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A HS#\n#     S#\n#A    S#\n#A  SSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Position**: The head (H) is at (row 3, column 4).

The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid).\n3. **Apples**: Located at (3,2), (5,1), (6,1).\n4. **Possible Directions**: UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since RIGHT is reversed).\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (3,4) takes the head to (3,3), which is empty (no walls or body collision). This direction directly leads toward the apple at (3,2) (two steps left), making it a safe and efficient path to eat an apple.\n- **UP**: Moving UP from (3,4) takes the head to (2,4), which is empty. However, this direction moves the snake away from the apples (located in lower rows), reducing the chance of quickly eating an apple.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (3,4) takes the head to (4,4), which is empty. This direction also moves the snake away from the nearest apple (3,2) and requires more steps to reach other apples.\n\n### Conclusion:\nContinuing LEFT is the best choice, as it safely directs the snake toward the nearest apple at (3,2) in the next move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#  AHSS#\n#     S#\n#A    S#\n#A   SS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (3,4) (row 3, column 4) and is currently moving LEFT. The possible directions the snake can turn are LEFT, UP, or DOWN (since reversing to RIGHT is not allowed). \n\n- **Moving LEFT**: The head will move to (3,3), which contains an apple ('A'). This is safe (no wall or self-collision) and will result in eating the apple, increasing the score by 1. \n- **Moving UP**: The head would move to (2,4), an empty space with no apple. \n- **Moving DOWN**: The head would move to (4,4), an empty space with no apple. \n\nThe optimal choice is to move LEFT to eat the apple. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n#  HSSS#\n#     S#\n#A    S#\n#A   SS#\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT. The goal is to choose a safe direction (LEFT, UP, DOWN; cannot reverse to RIGHT) that avoids collision with walls or the snake's body and ideally leads towards apples.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Directions:\n1. **LEFT (Current Direction)**:  \n   The head (H) at (3,2) would move to (3,1). This cell is empty (no wall or body). However, (3,1) has no apple. The next move could be UP to (2,1) (an apple), but (3,1) is adjacent to the wall (column 0), limiting future left movement.\n\n2. **UP**:  \n   The head would move to (2,2) (row 2, column 2). This cell is empty (no wall or body). From (2,2), the next move LEFT would reach (2,1), which contains an apple. This path is safe and directly targets the nearest apple.\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   The head would move to (4,2) (row 4, column 2). This cell is empty, but the nearest apples (at (2,1), (5,1), (6,1)) are farther away. This direction does not prioritize reaching an apple quickly.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP is optimal. It positions the snake to reach the nearest apple (at (2,1)) in the next move, avoiding walls and body collisions.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#A H   #\n#  SSSS#\n#     S#\n#A    S#\n#A    S#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (2,2) (row 2, column 2), moving in the UP direction. The snake's body segments are at (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5). The available apples are at (2,1), (5,1), and (6,1).\n\nThe snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **UP**: The head would move to (1,2), which is empty and safe but contains no apple.  \n- **LEFT**: The head would move to (2,1), which contains an apple. This is safe (no collision with walls or body) and would increase the score by 1, with the snake growing in length.  \n- **RIGHT**: The head would move to (2,3), which is empty and safe but contains no apple.  \n\nChoosing LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple, which is optimal for maximizing the score. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#AHS   #\n#  SSSS#\n#     S#\n#A    S#\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (row 2, column 2) with the current direction LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). Let's analyze possible moves:\n\n- **LEFT (current direction)**: The head moves to (2, 1), which is an apple ('A'). This is safe (no wall or self-collision). Eating the apple increases the score by 1 and grows the snake.  \n- **UP**: The head moves to (1, 2), which is empty. This is safe but does not eat an apple.  \n- **DOWN**: The head moves to (3, 2), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This causes a self-collision, ending the game.  \n- **RIGHT**: Reversing direction is not allowed.  \n\nThe optimal move is to continue moving LEFT to eat the apple and avoid collision. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#    A #\n#HSS   #\n#  SSSS#\n#     S#\n#A    S#\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is LEFT, and the current epoch is 23. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid), and moving LEFT would collide with the wall (column 0 is a wall). Thus, the valid directions are UP or DOWN.\n\n### Analysis of UP:\n- Moving UP would take the head from (2,1) to (1,1). (1,1) is empty (no wall or body collision), so this is safe. However, there are no apples at (1,1), and reaching the nearest apple (at (1,4)) would require subsequent RIGHT moves.\n\n### Analysis of DOWN:\n- Moving DOWN would take the head from (2,1) to (3,1). (3,1) is empty (no wall or body collision), so this is safe. The nearest apples are at (5,1) and (6,1) along column 1. Continuing to move DOWN from (3,1) would lead to (4,1) (empty), then (5,1) (apple), allowing the snake to eat an apple and grow. This path has two apples (at (5,1) and (6,1)) in a clear, unobstructed column.\n\nSince moving DOWN leads directly to apples in a safe, unblocked path, it is the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#    A #\n#SSS   #\n#H SSSS#\n#     S#\n#A     #\n#A     #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and collision risks:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The head 'H' is at (3,1) (row 3, column 1). The body 'S' segments are connected in a path: (3,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3) → (3,4) → (3,5) → (3,6) → (4,6) (tail).\n- **Current Direction**: DOWN. The snake cannot reverse to UP.\n- **Apples**: Located at (1,4), (5,1), and (6,1) (row 1, column 4; row 5, column 1; row 6, column 1).\n- **Collision Risks**: Walls are at the edges (column 0 or 7, row 0 or 7). The body occupies positions listed above.\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (3,1) would take the head to (3,0), which is a wall (column 0). This causes an immediate collision. **Invalid**.\n2. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (3,1) would take the head to (3,2). This is a safe empty space. However, the next move (if continuing RIGHT) would reach (3,3), which is part of the snake’s body. This risks collision. **Suboptimal**.\n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (3,1) takes the head to (4,1), which is a safe empty space. This direction leads toward the apples at (5,1) and (6,1) in subsequent moves, allowing the snake to eat apples and grow. **Safe and optimal**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nContinuing in the current direction (DOWN) avoids collisions and positions the snake to eat apples in future moves.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#    A #\n#SSS   #\n#S SSSS#\n#H     #\n#A     #\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4, 1) (row 4, column 1). The current direction is DOWN, and the snake cannot reverse to UP. \n\n- **Moving LEFT**: The head would move to (4, 0), which is a wall. This causes a collision and ends the game.  \n- **Moving RIGHT**: The head would move to (4, 2), an empty space. This is safe but does not eat an apple.  \n- **Moving DOWN**: The head would move to (5, 1), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score, grows the snake, and avoids collision.  \n\nThe optimal choice is to continue moving DOWN to eat the apple and avoid losing. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#    A #\n#SSS   #\n#S SSSS#\n#S   A #\n#H     #\n#A     #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current state:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at row 5, column 1.\n- Current direction is DOWN, so the snake cannot reverse to UP. Possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (5,1) would take the head to (5,0), which is a wall ('#'). This causes a collision, ending the game. Invalid.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (5,1) would take the head to (5,2), a space (' '). No apple here, and no collision with the snake's body (body segments are at (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,1)). Safe but no apple.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (5,1) takes the head to (6,1), which contains an apple ('A'). No collision with walls (row 6 is not the bottom wall) or the snake's body (body segments do not include (6,1)). Eating this apple increases the score and grows the snake.\n\nThus, the best direction is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A   A #\n#SSS   #\n#S SSSS#\n#S   A #\n#S     #\n#H     #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (6,1) (row 6, column 1) and is currently moving DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction, so it cannot turn UP. The possible directions to choose are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN. \n\n- **DOWN**: The next position would be (7,1), which is a wall (row 7 is the bottom wall). Collision with the wall would end the game.  \n- **LEFT**: The next position would be (6,0), which is a wall (column 0 is the left wall). Collision with the wall would end the game.  \n- **RIGHT**: The next position is (6,2), which is an empty space (no wall or snake body). This is a safe move.  \n\nThus, the only safe direction to avoid collision is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A   A #\n#SSS   #\n#S SSS #\n#S   A #\n#S     #\n#SH    #\n########\n\nTo determine the next direction, we analyze the snake's current state:\n- **Head position**: (row 6, column 2) (since 'H' is in row 6: \"#SH    #\", column 2).\n- **Current direction**: RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid).\n- **Possible directions**: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. \n\n### Analysis of each direction:\n1. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (6,2) leads to (7,2), which is a wall ('#'). This causes an immediate collision. **DOWN is invalid**.\n2. **UP**: Moving UP from (6,2) leads to (5,2). Row 5 is \"#S     #\", so (5,2) is empty (' '). No collision with walls or the snake's body (body parts are at (5,1)). **UP is safe**.\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (6,2) leads to (6,3). Row 6 is \"#SH    #\", so (6,3) is empty (' '). No collision with walls or the snake's body. **RIGHT is safe**.\n\n### Prioritizing apple collection:\nThe nearest apples are at (4,4) (row 4, column 4). Both UP and RIGHT directions can eventually lead to this apple, but:\n- Moving RIGHT keeps the snake aligned with its current direction, avoiding unnecessary turns. \n- The path via RIGHT (6,2) → (6,3) → (6,4) → (5,4) → (4,4) is clear of the snake's body and walls.\n\nThus, moving RIGHT is safe and strategically optimal.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#A   A #\n#SSS   #\n#S SS  #\n#S   A #\n#S     #\n#SSH   #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (row 6, column 3), and the current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). The possible directions to consider are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (row 7, column 3), which is a wall (row 7 is entirely walls). This causes a collision, so DOWN is invalid.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (row 6, column 4), which is a space (no wall or body collision). This is safe but does not reach an apple immediately.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (row 5, column 3), which is a space (no wall or body collision). This is safe and moves the head closer to the apple at (row 4, column 4), which is the nearest apple.  \n\nThe apple at (row 4, column 4) is the most accessible. Moving UP brings the head closer to this apple, making it a better choice to maximize the score. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#A   A #\n#SSS   #\n#S S   #\n#S   A #\n#S H   #\n#SSS   #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at row 5, column 2 (coordinates (5,2)).\n- **Current Direction**: The snake is moving UP.\n- **Valid Moves**: The snake cannot reverse direction (DOWN is invalid). Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n- **Collisions**: \n  - **LEFT**: Moving left from (5,2) leads to (5,1), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This causes a self-collision (invalid).\n  - **RIGHT**: Moving right from (5,2) leads to (5,3), an empty space (safe).\n  - **UP**: Moving up from (5,2) leads to (4,2), an empty space (safe).\n- **Apples**: Apples are at (1,1), (1,4), and (4,4). The closest apple is (4,4), which is 2 steps right and 1 step up from the head.\n\n### Analysis of Safe Moves:\n- **UP**: Moving UP to (4,2) positions the snake closer to the apple at (4,4). From (4,2), subsequent RIGHT moves can reach (4,4) (the apple) in 2 steps.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT to (5,3) is safe but requires an extra UP move to reach (4,3) before moving RIGHT to (4,4). This path is longer than the UP-first path.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP is optimal as it directly positions the snake toward the nearest apple (4,4) with fewer steps, avoiding collisions and maximizing the chance to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A   A #\n#SSS   #\n#S     #\n#S H A #\n#S S   #\n#SSS   #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4, 3) (row 4, column 3).

Possible directions to choose are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (3, 3), which is empty (no walls or self-collision), but no apple is present here.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (4, 2), which is empty, but no apple is present here.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (4, 4), which is empty. From (4, 4), the next move (if direction remains RIGHT) would reach (4, 5), where an apple ('A') is located. This path directly leads to eating an apple in the next epoch.  \n\nChoosing RIGHT allows the snake to move toward the apple at (4, 5) efficiently. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#A   A #\n#SS    #\n#S     #\n#S SHA #\n#S S   #\n#SSS   #\n########\n\nTo determine the next direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 4, column 3).\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT.

Checking the board, (4, 4) is 'S' (snake's body). Colliding with the body ends the game. **Invalid**.\n2. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (5, 3). Checking the board, (5, 3) is 'S' (snake's body). Colliding with the body ends the game. **Invalid**.\n3. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (3, 3). Checking the board, (3, 3) is empty (no walls or body segments). This is safe. **Valid**.\n\nThe only safe direction is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#A   A #\n#S     #\n#S  H  #\n#S SSA #\n#S S   #\n#SSS   #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 3, column 4).\n- **Current Direction**: UP (snake cannot reverse to DOWN).\n- **Apples**: Located at (1,1), (1,4), and (4,5).\n- **Body Positions**: The snake’s body ('S') occupies columns 1 (rows 2-6), column 3 (rows 4-6), and column 4 (row 4). No immediate collision risk in the head’s adjacent squares.\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (2,4) (empty). This is safe but does not eat an apple immediately. The next move (epoch 34) could continue UP to reach (1,4) (apple), but row 1 is near the top wall (row 0), limiting future movement options.\n   \n2. **DOWN**: Invalid (reverse of current direction) and (4,4) is occupied by the snake’s body.\n\n3. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (3,3) (empty). This avoids collision but does not directly lead toward any apple. The apple at (4,5) or (1,4) would require additional turns, increasing collision risk.\n\n4. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (3,5) (empty). From (3,5), the next move (epoch 34) can be DOWN to reach (4,5) (apple). This path leads to an apple in the next step and moves the snake into a more open area (columns 5-7 are mostly empty), reducing future collision risk.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT is optimal as it safely directs the snake toward the apple at (4,5) in the next epoch while avoiding the crowded left\/central columns and maintaining access to open space.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A   A #\n#      #\n#S  SH #\n#S SSA #\n#S S   #\n#SSS   #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state. The snake's head 'H' is at position (3,5) (row 3, column 5), and the current direction is RIGHT.

Eating this apple increases the score by 1 and allows the snake to grow.  \n\nSince moving DOWN leads to an apple (a high-value target) and is a valid direction (not reversing), it is the best choice.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A   A #\n#    A #\n#S  SS #\n#S SSH #\n#S S   #\n#SSS   #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4,5) (row 4, column 5).

From (4,6), the snake can later turn UP (allowed, as UP is not the reverse of RIGHT) to approach the apples at (2,5) and (1,5).  \n- **DOWN**: Moving down takes the head to (5,5), which is empty. However, continuing down further would eventually hit the bottom wall (row 7), and this path does not directly lead toward the apples.  \n\nChoosing RIGHT allows the snake to avoid collision and navigate toward the apples at (2,5) and (1,5) in subsequent moves. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#A   A #\n#    A #\n#   SS #\n#S SSSH#\n#S S   #\n#SSS   #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head ('H') is at (row 4, column 6).\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT.

The snake needs to navigate toward these apples to increase its score.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\n- Moving UP positions the snake closer to the apples in the upper rows (rows 1-2). This direction allows the snake to potentially reach the apples at (1,4) or (2,4) with subsequent moves.\n- Moving DOWN would take the snake further from the apples, reducing opportunities to eat them.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe safest and most strategic direction is UP, as it avoids collisions and positions the snake to pursue apples.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#A   A #\n#    A #\n#   SSH#\n#  SSSS#\n#S S   #\n#SSS   #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is currently at position (3,6) (row 3, column 6).

The snake's head (H) is at position (4, 3) (row 4, column 3). The current direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). The possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n- **Moving UP**: The next position would be (3, 3). Checking row 3, column 3: the cell contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple will increase the score by 1, grow the snake, and avoid collision (no walls or self-collision).\n- **Moving LEFT**: The next position would be (4, 2), which is empty (' '). No apple is eaten, and no immediate benefit.\n- **Moving RIGHT**: The next position would be (4, 4), which is also empty (' '). No apple is eaten, and no immediate benefit.\n\nMoving UP directly leads to eating an apple, which is the most beneficial action. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#  H   #\n#  S   #\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is UP, and the goal is to choose a safe direction (UP, LEFT, RIGHT; cannot reverse to DOWN) to move toward apples without collision. \n\n### Analysis of Possible Moves:\n1. **UP**: The head moves from (3,2) to (2,2) (row 3 to row 2, column 2). This position is empty (no wall\/body\/apple). The body shifts to (3,2). Safe, but no apple eaten immediately. This positions the snake to potentially turn right toward the apple at (2,5) in subsequent moves.\n\n2. **LEFT**: The head moves from (3,2) to (3,1) (row 3, column 2 to 1). This position is empty. The body shifts to (3,2). Safe, no apple eaten. This positions the snake to potentially move down toward the apple at (5,2) in subsequent moves.\n\n3. **RIGHT**: The head moves from (3,2) to (3,3) (row 3, column 2 to 3). This position is empty. The body shifts to (3,2). Safe, no apple eaten. This positions the snake to potentially continue right toward the apple at (2,5) or (6,5) in subsequent moves.\n\n### Best Choice:\nAll directions are safe, but moving **RIGHT** allows the snake to head toward the apple at (2,5) (row 2, column 5) with minimal turns. After moving RIGHT, the snake can continue right to (3,4), (3,5), then up to (2,5) (the apple) in subsequent epochs. This path avoids walls and self-collision.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#  SH  #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: Head (H) is at (3,4), body (S) at (3,3). Length = 2 (1 apple eaten).\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid).\n- **Apples**: At (2,5), (5,2), (6,5). The closest apple is (2,5) (Manhattan distance 2 from the head).\n- **Possible Moves**: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (LEFT is reversed and invalid).\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **RIGHT**: New head position (3,5). This is a safe, empty space. The snake moves closer to the apple at (2,5) (now 1 step up).\n2. **UP**: New head position (2,4). This is a safe, empty space. The snake moves closer to the apple at (2,5) (now 1 step right).\n3. **DOWN**: New head position (4,4). This is a safe, empty space but moves the snake away from the closest apple (2,5).\n\n### Optimal Choice:\nThe closest apple is (2,5). Moving UP brings the snake to (2,4), one step away from (2,5) (next move RIGHT would reach the apple). This path maximizes the chance of eating the apple quickly.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#   H A#\n#   S  #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. The snake's head ('H') is at (row 2, column 3), with a body segment ('S') at (row 3, column 3). The current direction is UP, so the snake cannot reverse to DOWN. Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n### Analysis of each possible direction:\n1. **UP**: Moving up would take the head to (row 1, column 3). This cell is empty, but continuing upward risks hitting the top wall (row 0) in subsequent moves. No apple is in this path.\n   \n2. **LEFT**: Moving left would take the head to (row 2, column 2). This cell is empty, but the nearest apple in this direction is at (row 5, column 2), requiring multiple downward moves. This path is longer and less direct.\n   \n3. **RIGHT**: Moving right takes the head to (row 2, column 4), which is empty. The next move (if direction remains RIGHT) would take the head to (row 2, column 5), where an apple ('A') is located. This allows the snake to eat the apple in the next epoch, increasing the score and length.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT is optimal, as it positions the snake to reach an apple in the next move without collision risks.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#   SHA#\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (row 2, column 5), with a body segment (S) at (row 2, column 4). The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). \n\nAnalyzing possible moves:\n- **RIGHT**: The head will move to (row 2, column 6), which contains an apple (A). Eating this apple will grow the snake's length by 1, increase the score, and is safe (no collision with walls or itself).\n- **UP**: The head would move to (row 1, column 5), a blank space. No apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow.\n- **DOWN**: The head would move to (row 3, column 5), a blank space. No apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow.\n\nMoving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple, which is optimal for maximizing the score. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#   SSH#\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is currently at position (2, 6) (row 2, column 6). The current direction is RIGHT, but moving RIGHT would take the head to (2, 7), which is a wall (collision). The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). The remaining valid directions are UP or DOWN.\n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (1, 6), an empty space. This direction moves the snake away from the apples located at (4, 4), (5, 3), and (6, 6).\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (3, 6), an empty space. This direction moves the snake toward the apple at (6, 6) (same column, lower rows), which is the most direct path to an apple.\n\nChoosing DOWN allows the snake to approach the apple at (6, 6) safely without collision. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#    SS#\n#     H#\n#   A  #\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (3,5) (row 3, column 5) and is currently moving DOWN.

The apple at (6,5) is directly below the head along the current DOWN direction.\n- Moving DOWN will take the head to (4,5) (safe, no collision with walls or body), and this path leads toward the apple at (6,5) in subsequent steps.\n- Other directions (LEFT\/RIGHT) do not immediately lead to apples and are less direct than continuing DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#     S#\n#     S#\n#   A H#\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: Head (H) is at (row 4, column 5).

Valid directions: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n- **Apple Positions**: Apples (A) are at (row 4, column 3), (row 5, column 2), and (row 6, column 6).\n\n### Analysis of Possible Moves:\n1. **LEFT**: Moving left from (4,5) to (4,4). This cell is empty (safe). Next, continuing left to (4,3) (an apple) is feasible in the subsequent move (since the snake can keep moving left, as reversing to RIGHT is not required). This path leads to the closest apple.\n2. **RIGHT**: Moving right to (4,6) (empty, safe). However, this does not position the snake closer to any apple.\n3. **DOWN**: Moving down to (5,5) (empty, safe). This leads away from the nearest apple (row 4, column 3) and requires more steps to reach other apples.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT positions the snake to reach the nearest apple (row 4, column 3) in the next move, making it the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#     S#\n#   AHS#\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, analyze the current game state:\n\n- **Snake Position**: Head 'H' is at (row 4, column 4). Body segments 'S' are at (row 4, column 5) and (row 3, column 6).\n- **Current Direction**: LEFT (snake is moving left; cannot reverse to RIGHT).\n- **Apples**: Located at (row 4, column 3), (row 5, column 2), and (row 6, column 6).\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **LEFT**: Moving left from (4,4) leads to (4,3), which contains an apple ('A'). This is a valid move (no wall\/self-collision). Eating the apple increases the score and grows the snake.\n2. **UP**: Moving up to (3,4) is empty (no apple). Valid but no score gain.\n3. **DOWN**: Moving down to (5,4) is empty (no apple). Valid but no score gain.\n4. **RIGHT**: Reverse of current direction (invalid per rules).\n\n### Best Choice:\nMoving LEFT directly leads to an apple, maximizing score growth. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#     S#\n#   HSS#\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (4, 3) (row 4, column 3) and is currently moving LEFT. The snake's body segments are at (4, 4), (4, 5), and (3, 5). The apples are located at (1, 2), (5, 2), and (6, 5). \n\nThe snake cannot reverse direction, so valid directions from LEFT are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. We need to choose the safest and most optimal direction to reach an apple. \n\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (4, 2), which is empty (no apple or collision). This is safe but does not immediately reach an apple.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (3, 3), which is empty (no apple or collision). This is safe but moves away from the nearest apples.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (5, 3), which is empty (no apple or collision). From (5, 3), the next move LEFT would reach the apple at (5, 2), allowing the snake to eat it in the next epoch.  \n\nDOWN is the best choice as it positions the snake to reach the nearest apple (5, 2) in the next move. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SSS#\n#  AH  #\n#     A#\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Position**: The snake's head ('H') is at (row 5, column 3). The body ('S') is in row 4, columns 3-5: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). The snake's length is 4 (head + 3 body segments).\n2. **Current Direction**: DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction, so UP is invalid. Valid directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n3. **Apple Positions**: Apples ('A') are at (1,2), (5,2), and (6,5).\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves:\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (5,3) leads to (5,2), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple will increase the score by 1 and grow the snake. The new head position (5,2) is safe (no collision with walls or the snake's body).\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (5,3) leads to (5,4), an empty space. No apple is present here, so the snake does not grow, and the score remains unchanged.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (5,3) leads to (6,3), an empty space. No apple is present here, so the snake does not grow, and the score remains unchanged.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple, increasing the score and growing the snake. This is the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A  SSS#\n#  HS  #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (5, 2) (row 5, column 2) with a current direction of LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so possible inputs are UP, DOWN, or LEFT. \n\n### Analysis of Possible Moves:\n1. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (5, 1). This position is empty (no apple, wall, or body collision). The body shifts, but no collisions occur. This move keeps the snake aligned left but does not immediately target an apple.  \n2. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (6, 2). This position is empty, but the apple at (6, 5) is farther away, requiring additional rightward moves (risking wall collision if not careful).  \n3. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (4, 2). This position is empty, and it brings the snake closer to the nearest apple at (4, 1) (one left move away from (4, 2)). This path directly targets the closest apple.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP is optimal as it positions the snake to reach the nearest apple (at (4, 1)) in the next move by turning left, avoiding collisions and efficiently progressing toward increasing the score.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A HSS #\n#  SS  #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4,4) (row 4, column 4). The current direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). Possible directions to choose are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **UP**: Next head position is (3,4). This cell is empty (safe) but contains no apple.  \n- **LEFT**: Next head position is (4,3). This cell is empty (safe) and no apple, but moving LEFT allows the snake to progress toward the apple at (4,1) in subsequent moves.  \n- **RIGHT**: Next head position is (4,5), which is occupied by the snake's body (S). This causes a collision (game over).  \n\nThe safest and most strategic choice is LEFT, as it avoids collision and positions the snake to reach the nearby apple at (4,1) in future moves. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#AHSS  #\n#  SS  #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4, 2) (row 4, column 2). The current direction is LEFT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). Let's analyze possible moves:\n\n1. **LEFT Direction**: Moving left would take the head to (4, 1). Checking this position: row 4, column 1 is an apple ('A'). This is safe (not a wall or body segment). Eating the apple increases the score and grows the snake.  \n2. **UP Direction**: Moving up would take the head to (3, 2). This position is empty (no apple, no collision), but does not eat an apple.  \n3. **DOWN Direction**: Moving down would take the head to (5, 2). This position is occupied by the snake's body ('S'), causing a collision and ending the game.  \n\nThe best move is LEFT, as it safely eats an apple and avoids collision. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A   #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#HSSS  #\n#  SS  #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (row 4, column 1), moving LEFT. Moving LEFT would collide with the wall (column 0 is a '#'), so LEFT is invalid. The snake cannot reverse direction (current direction is LEFT, so RIGHT is forbidden). This leaves UP or DOWN as valid options.\n\n### Analysis of UP:\n- New head position: (row 3, column 1). This is a space (' ') and not part of the snake's body (body segments are at (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3)). Safe.\n- This direction allows the snake to move upward, potentially approaching the apple at (row 1, column 2) or (row 2, column 5) in subsequent moves.\n\n### Analysis of DOWN:\n- New head position: (row 5, column 1). This is a space (' ') and not part of the snake's body. Safe.\n- However, moving DOWN limits future options (e.g., moving RIGHT from (5,1) leads to (5,2), which is a body segment ('S'), causing collision). This direction is riskier and less likely to reach apples.\n\nUP is the better choice as it avoids immediate danger and provides a path toward apples.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A   #\n#    A #\n#H     #\n#SSS   #\n#  SS  #\n#     A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: Head (H) is at (row 3, column 1). Body segments (S) are at (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,2), (5,3).\n- **Current Direction**: UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid).\n- **Apples**: Located at (1,2), (2,4), and (6,5).\n- **Possible Moves**: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is reversed and invalid).\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (3,0), which is a wall. This causes an immediate collision, ending the game. **Invalid**.\n2. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (3,2). This cell is empty (no wall or body collision). Safe but does not reach an apple immediately.\n3. **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (2,1). This cell is empty (no wall or body collision). Safe and positions the snake closer to the nearest apple at (1,2) (row 1, column 2).\n\n### Optimal Choice:\nMoving UP keeps the snake safe, avoids collisions, and positions it to reach the nearest apple (1,2) in subsequent moves. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#H   A #\n#S     #\n#SSS   #\n#  S   #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at row 2, column 1.

Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (2,0), which is a wall (row 2 starts with '#'), causing a collision. Invalid.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (2,2), an empty space (safe). This direction allows the snake to move toward the apple at (2,5) in subsequent steps, but it would take 4 moves to reach that apple.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (1,1), an empty space (safe). This direction allows the snake to move toward the apple at (1,3) in subsequent steps, which is only 3 moves away (faster than reaching (2,5)).  \n\nSince UP leads to a closer apple and avoids immediate collision, it is the optimal choice.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#H A   #\n#S   A #\n#S     #\n#SSS   #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nTo determine the next direction, we analyze the snake's current state:\n- The snake's head (H) is at position (1,1) (row 1, column 1).\n- Current direction is UP, so the snake cannot reverse to DOWN.\n- Possible directions to consider: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is invalid as it reverses the current direction).\n\n### Analysis of each possible direction:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (0,1), which is a wall (row 0 is entirely walls). This causes a collision, ending the game. **Invalid**.\n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (1,0), which is a wall (column 0 in row 1 is a wall). This causes a collision, ending the game. **Invalid**.\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (1,2). This position is empty (no wall or snake body segment). The snake's body segments are at (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), so (1,2) is safe.

This causes a collision, ending the game.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (row 2, column 2), which is empty (no apple, no collision). This is safe but does not eat an apple.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (row 1, column 3), which contains an apple ('A'). This is safe (no wall or self-collision) and allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score and growing the snake.  \n\nThe best choice is to continue moving RIGHT to eat the apple. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SSH  A#\n#S   A #\n#S     #\n#SS    #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: Head ('H') is at (row 1, column 3).

This causes an immediate collision and game over. **Invalid**.\n   \n2. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (2,3). This cell is empty (no wall or body collision). The path to the nearest apple (2,5) would require subsequent RIGHT moves, but this is a longer-term consideration. **Safe but not immediately apple-adjacent**.\n   \n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (1,4), an empty cell (no collision). This direction aligns with the snake's current movement and leads directly toward the apple at (1,6) (only 3 steps away: (1,4) → (1,5) → (1,6)). The path is clear of walls and the snake's body. **Safe and directly toward an apple**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nContinuing RIGHT is the safest and most direct path to an apple, avoiding collisions and maximizing progress toward increasing the score.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SSSH A#\n#S   A #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (1, 4) (row 1, column 4), and the current direction is RIGHT.

This would cause a collision, ending the game. This is invalid.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (2,5), which contains an apple ('A'). This position is not a wall or part of the snake's body, so it is safe. Eating the apple would increase the score and grow the snake.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (1,6), which also contains an apple ('A'). This position is not a wall or part of the snake's body, so it is safe. Eating the apple would increase the score and grow the snake.  \n\nBetween the valid options (DOWN and RIGHT), moving RIGHT is optimal because the apple is directly in the current direction of movement, avoiding unnecessary turns and maintaining a straightforward path.

Body segments ('S') are at (1,1)-(1,5), (2,4)-(2,5), and (3,5).\n- **Current Direction**: LEFT (snake is moving left).\n- **Apples**: Located at (3,1), (3,2), and (6,5).\n- **Collision Rules**: The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., LEFT → RIGHT). It loses if it hits walls ('#') or its own body ('S').\n\n### Possible Directions (Cannot Reverse from LEFT):\n1. **LEFT**: New head position is (3,3) (column 4 - 1 = 3).  \n   - (3,3) is empty (no wall or body), so safe.  \n   - This move positions the snake to reach the apple at (3,2) in the next step (if direction remains LEFT), which is optimal for scoring.  \n\n2. **UP**: New head position is (2,4) (row 3 - 1 = 2).  \n   - (2,4) is occupied by the snake’s body ('S'), causing a collision. **Invalid**.  \n\n3. **DOWN**: New head position is (4,4) (row 3 + 1 = 4).  \n   - (4,4) is empty (safe), but this moves the snake away from the nearest apples (at (3,1)-(3,2)) and delays apple consumption.  \n\n4. **RIGHT**: Reverses direction (invalid per rules).  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT is safe, positions the snake to reach an apple in the next step, and avoids collisions. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#  SSSS#\n#    SS#\n#AAHSS #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 3, column 3) (0-indexed).  \n2. **Current Direction**: LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid).  \n3. **Possible Directions**: UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT.  \n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n- **LEFT (Current Direction)**:  \n  The next head position would be (3, 2). Checking the board, (3, 2) contains an 'A' (apple). Moving LEFT here would:  \n  - Avoid collision (no wall or snake body in (3, 2)).  \n  - Eat the apple, increasing the score by 1 and growing the snake.  \n\n- **UP**:  \n  The next head position would be (2, 3). This cell is empty (' '), with no apple. Safe but no score gain.  \n\n- **DOWN**:  \n  The next head position would be (4, 3). This cell is empty (' '), with no apple. Safe but no score gain.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple, which is optimal for maximizing the score.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#  SSSS#\n#    SS#\n#AHSSS #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (3, 2) (row 3, column 2), and the current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so possible next directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. \n\n- **Moving LEFT**: The head would move to (3, 1), which contains an apple ('A'). This is safe (no collision with walls or self) and would increase the score by 1. However, the next move in the same direction (LEFT) would take the head to (3, 0), a wall, risking collision.  \n- **Moving UP**: The head would move to (2, 2), an empty space (no apple). This avoids collision but does not increase the score.  \n- **Moving DOWN**: The head would move to (4, 2), which contains an apple ('A'). This is safe (no collision with walls or self) and increases the score by 1. Additionally, moving DOWN positions the head in row 4, which is closer to the third apple at (6, 6) and provides more safe movement options in subsequent epochs (e.g., DOWN to (5, 2), LEFT to (4, 1), or RIGHT to (4, 3)).  \n\nChoosing DOWN allows the snake to eat an apple, avoid immediate wall collision risks, and positions it better for future apple collection. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#  SSSS#\n#    SS#\n#ASSSS #\n# H    #\n#      #\n# A   A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at (row 4, column 2).\n- Current direction is DOWN, so the snake cannot reverse to UP.\n- Possible directions: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n- Key apples are at (row 3, column 1), (row 6, column 2), and (row 6, column 6).\n\n### Analysis of directions:\n1. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (4,2) leads to (5,2). This position is empty (no wall\/body collision). Continuing DOWN in subsequent moves would reach (6,2), which contains an apple, allowing the snake to eat it and grow. This is the most direct path to an apple.\n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (4,2) leads to (4,1). This position is empty but does not lead toward any nearby apple. Further movement in this direction would not quickly reach an apple.\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (4,2) leads to (4,3). This position is empty but also does not lead toward any nearby apple. Reaching the apple at (6,6) would require more steps.\n\nThe safest and most efficient path to an apple is continuing in the current direction (DOWN).\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   SSS#\n#    SS#\n#ASSSS #\n# S    #\n# H    #\n# A   A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (5,2) (row 5, column 2) and is currently moving DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction, so it cannot choose UP. The possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. \n\n- **Moving DOWN**: The head will move to (6,2), which is an apple ('A'). Eating the apple will increase the score by 1 and grow the snake. The new head position (6,2) is within the play area (not a wall) and does not collide with the snake's body (the current body segments are in other positions). This is a safe and beneficial move.  \n- **Moving LEFT**: The head would move to (5,1), which is empty but contains no apple. This does not grow the snake or increase the score.  \n- **Moving RIGHT**: The head would move to (5,3), which is empty but contains no apple. This also does not grow the snake or increase the score.  \n\nThe best choice is to move DOWN to eat the apple and grow the snake. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#   SSS#\n#    SS#\n#ASSSS #\n# S    #\n# S    #\n# HA  A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (6, 2) (row 6, column 2) and is currently moving DOWN. The next move cannot reverse direction (so UP is invalid), and moving DOWN would collide with the wall at row 7, column 2. This leaves LEFT and RIGHT as valid options. \n\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (6, 1), which is empty and safe. However, this direction moves away from the nearest apples (at (6, 4) and (6, 6)) and may lead into a corner if continued.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (6, 3), which is empty and safe. This direction moves toward the apple at (6, 4), allowing the snake to potentially eat it in the next move.  \n\nChoosing RIGHT is optimal as it positions the snake to reach an apple quickly. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#A  SSS#\n#    SS#\n#ASSSS #\n# S    #\n# S    #\n# SH  A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head ('H') is at (row 6, column 3).\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so LEFT is invalid.\n- **Possible Directions**: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (LEFT is reversed and disallowed).\n- **Collisions to Avoid**: Walls (row 0 and row 7 are all '#') and self (body segments marked 'S').\n- **Apples**: Located at (1,1), (3,1), and (6,6).\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **DOWN**: The next head position would be (7, 3), which is a wall (row 7 is all '#'). This causes an immediate collision and game over. **Invalid**.\n   \n2. **UP**: The next head position is (5, 3). Checking row 5: \"# S    #\", (5,3) is empty (no wall or body segment). This is safe but moves the snake away from the nearest apple at (6,6). **Safe but suboptimal**.\n\n3. **RIGHT**: The next head position is (6, 4). Checking row 6: \"# SH  A#\", (6,4) is empty (no wall or body segment). This is safe and moves the snake closer to the apple at (6,6) (current head at (6,3) → next (6,4) → (6,5) → (6,6) (apple)). **Safe and optimal**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT is the safest and most strategic choice, as it avoids collisions and progresses toward the nearest apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#A   SS#\n#    SS#\n#ASSSS #\n# S    #\n# S    #\n# SSH A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at row 6, column 4 (coordinates (6,4)).\n2. **Current Direction**: The snake is moving RIGHT. Reversing direction (LEFT) is invalid.\n3. **Possible Directions**: From RIGHT, valid directions are UP, DOWN, or continuing RIGHT. DOWN is invalid (row 7 is a wall). Thus, options are UP or RIGHT.\n4. **Apple Positions**: Apples ('A') are at (1,1), (3,1), and (6,6).\n5. **Collision Checks**:\n   - **RIGHT**: Next position is (6,5), which is empty (no walls or snake body 'S'). Safe.\n   - **UP**: Next position is (5,4), which is empty. Safe.\n   - **DOWN**: Next position is (7,4), a wall. Game over. Invalid.\n\n### Strategy:\nThe closest apple is at (6,6), which is two steps to the RIGHT of the head. Moving RIGHT now (to (6,5)) positions the snake to reach (6,6) in the next move, allowing it to eat the apple. This path avoids collisions and directly targets an apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A    S#\n#    SS#\n#ASSSS #\n# S    #\n# S    #\n# SSSHA#\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is located at row 6, column 5. The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). The possible directions to choose are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n- **DOWN**: Moving down from (6,5) would lead to row 7, column 5, which is a wall (`#`). This causes a collision, so DOWN is invalid.  \n- **UP**: Moving up from (6,5) leads to row 5, column 5, which is empty (no collision). However, this position has no apple, so the snake does not grow or gain a score.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving right from (6,5) leads to row 6, column 6, which contains an apple (`A`). This is a valid move (no collision with walls or the snake's body), and eating the apple increases the score by 1 and grows the snake.  \n\nChoosing RIGHT is optimal as it allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, increasing the score and length safely. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A    S#\n#    SS#\n#ASSSS #\n# S   A#\n# S    #\n# SSSSH#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (6,6) (row 6, column 6) and is currently moving RIGHT.

Invalid.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (7,6), which is a wall (row 7 is all '#'). Collision with wall, game over. Invalid.\n- **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (5,6). Checking (5,6) on the board: row 5 is \"# S    #\", so (5,6) is empty (no wall or snake body). Safe. No apple at (5,6), but the move avoids collision.\n\nLEFT is invalid (reverse of RIGHT).

The next possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (since reversing to DOWN is not allowed). \n\n- **Moving UP**: The head will move to (4,5), which is an apple ('A'). This is safe (no wall or self-collision) and will result in eating the apple, increasing the score, and growing the snake.  \n- **Moving LEFT**: The head will move to (5,4), which is an empty space. This is safe but does not eat an apple.  \n- **Moving RIGHT**: The head will move to (5,6), which is a wall ('#').

Row 3, column 5 is 'S' (snake's body), causing a collision. **Invalid**.\n\n2. **DOWN Direction**:  \n   Moving DOWN from (4,5) leads to (5,5). Row 5, column 5 is a space (safe, no collision). However, if the next direction is DOWN again, the snake would move to (6,5), which is 'S' (body). This limits future options but is safe for the current step.\n\n3. **LEFT Direction**:  \n   Moving LEFT from (4,5) leads to (4,4). Row 4, column 4 is a space (safe, no collision).

Row 3, column 3 is 'S' (part of the snake's body), causing a self-collision. This is invalid.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (4, 2), which is empty (safe). However, the next move in the same direction (LEFT again) would take the head to (4, 1), which is 'S' (body), leading to a collision. This limits future options.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (5, 3), which is empty (safe). This direction avoids immediate collision and provides more flexibility for future moves (e.g., LEFT to (5, 2) or RIGHT to (5, 4), both empty).  \n\nGiven the need to avoid collisions and maintain movement options, DOWN is the safest choice. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#ASSS A#\n# S SSS#\n# S H S#\n# SSSSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at row 5, column 3, and it is currently moving DOWN.

The current direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). The goal is to choose a direction (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) to move toward an apple ('A') while avoiding walls and self-collision.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (1, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 4) (row, column).\n2. **Manhattan Distance**: The closest apples are (1, 3) and (2, 4), both 3 steps away from the head (4, 3).\n3. **Path Safety**: \n   - Moving UP toward (1, 3) would eventually reach the top wall (row 0), limiting future movement.\n   - Moving RIGHT toward (2, 4) keeps the snake in the middle of the board, leaving more space for subsequent moves after eating the apple.\n\n### Analysis of Directions:\n- **UP**: Moves to (3, 3). While this path can reach (1, 3) in 3 steps, it risks hitting the top wall shortly after eating the apple.\n- **LEFT**: Moves to (4, 2). This path leads to (1, 2) but is longer (4 steps) and less optimal.\n- **RIGHT**: Moves to (4, 4). This path reaches (2, 4) in 3 steps (via subsequent UP moves) and avoids immediate wall collisions, providing more flexibility post-apple consumption.\n\nThus, the optimal direction is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  AA  #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (4,3) (row 4, column 3) and is currently moving RIGHT. The snake has a length of 1 (only the head) and must avoid walls (#) and self-collision (no body yet). The goal is to eat apples (A) to increase the score. \n\n### Analysis of Possible Moves:\n- **Current Direction Restriction**: The snake cannot reverse direction, so from RIGHT, allowed directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (LEFT is reversed and invalid).\n- **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (1,2), (1,3), and (2,4).\n- **Safety Check**:\n  - **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (4,4). This position is empty (no wall\/body), so it is safe.\n  - **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (3,3). This position is empty, so it is safe.\n  - **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (5,3). This position is empty, but continuing DOWN would approach the bottom wall (row 7), increasing collision risk.\n\n### Strategy:\nThe closest apples are (1,3) and (2,4), both at a Manhattan distance of 3 from the head. Moving RIGHT reduces the distance to (2,4) (new distance: 2) and keeps the snake away from the bottom wall. Moving UP reduces the distance to (1,3) (new distance: 2) but is also safe. However, continuing in the current direction (RIGHT) avoids unnecessary direction changes and maintains a path toward (2,4), which is equally accessible.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  AA  #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#    H #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, we analyze the snake's current position, apple locations, and movement constraints. The snake's head ('H') is at (row 4, column 4), moving RIGHT. Apples ('A') are at (1,2), (1,3), and (2,4). The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., RIGHT → LEFT is invalid), but can turn UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT.\n\n- **Continuing RIGHT**: The head moves to (4,5), which is empty (no apple). This avoids collision but does not help reach apples quickly.  \n- **Turning DOWN**: The head moves to (5,4), which is empty. This moves the snake away from apples, reducing the chance to eat them soon.  \n- **Turning UP**: The head moves to (3,4), which is empty. From (3,4), the next move (if direction remains UP) would reach (2,4), where an apple is located. This path directly targets the nearest apple (2,4) in two steps, maximizing the chance to eat it and grow.  \n\nThus, turning UP is the optimal choice to reach an apple efficiently.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#  AA  #\n#    A #\n#    H #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current head position is at row 3, column 4 (coordinates (3,4)). The current direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). \n\nIf the snake continues moving UP, the next head position will be (2,4). Checking row 2, column 4, there is an apple ('A'). Moving UP will allow the snake to eat this apple, increase the score by 1, and grow in length. \n\nOther possible directions (LEFT, RIGHT) would move the head to (3,3) or (3,5), which are empty spaces with no apples. Since moving UP is safe (no wall or self-collision) and directly leads to eating an apple, this is the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  AA A#\n#    H #\n#    S #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (2,4) (row 2, column 4), and it is currently moving UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid), leaving UP, LEFT, or RIGHT as possible directions. \n\n### Analysis of possible moves:\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (1,4). Checking row 1, column 4 is an apple ('A'). Eating this apple would increase the score by 1 and grow the snake. This is safe (no collision with walls or the snake's body).\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (2,3). This cell is empty (no apple), and no collision occurs, but it does not immediately reach an apple.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (2,5). This cell is empty (no apple), and no collision occurs, but it does not immediately reach an apple.\n\nThe best move is UP, as it directly leads to eating an apple in the next step.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  AAHA#\n#    S #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (row 1, column 5). The current direction is UP, but moving UP would take the head to row 0 (a wall), causing a collision. The snake cannot reverse direction (UP → DOWN is invalid), so valid directions are LEFT or RIGHT.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (row 1, column 4), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score and grows the snake. The body segment ('S') at (row 2, column 4) will move to the previous head position (row 1, column 5). No collision occurs, as the new head position is safe (not a wall or body).\n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (row 1, column 6), which also contains an apple ('A'). However, moving RIGHT further would lead to (row 1, column 7) (a wall) in the next move, limiting future options. \n\nChoosing LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple safely and positions it to potentially eat another apple at (row 1, column 3) in the next move. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#  AHSA#\n#   AS #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT. The snake's head 'H' is at (row 1, column 5), with a body segment 'S' at (row 1, column 6). The snake is moving LEFT, so the next potential head position (if direction remains LEFT) is (row 1, column 4), which contains an apple 'A'. \n\nPossible directions: The snake cannot reverse direction (RIGHT is invalid). Checking other options:\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (row 0, column 5), which is a wall ('#'), causing a collision.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (row 2, column 5), which is a body segment ('S'), causing a self-collision.\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT to (row 1, column 4) is safe (no walls or body collision) and contains an apple, allowing the snake to eat the apple, grow, and increase the score.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#  HSSA#\n#   AS #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: Head ('H') is at (row=1, column=3). Body ('S') segments are at (1,4) and (1,5). Current direction is LEFT.\n- **Apples**: Located at (1,6), (2,4), and (6,6).\n- **Constraints**: The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., cannot switch from LEFT to RIGHT). The game ends on wall collision or self-collision.\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP from (1,3) leads to row=0 (a wall), causing immediate game over. **Invalid**.\n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (1,3) leads to (1,2) (empty space). Safe but no apple. The snake does not grow, and this direction does not lead toward nearby apples.\n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (1,3) leads to (2,3) (empty space). Safe. This positions the snake to potentially reach the apple at (2,4) in the next move (by turning RIGHT, which is allowed since the new direction would be DOWN, and RIGHT is not a reverse of DOWN).\n\n### Optimal Choice:\nMoving DOWN is the best option. It avoids immediate danger, positions the snake to reach the apple at (2,4) in the next move, and allows for continued growth.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#  SSSA#\n#  HA  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (row 2, column 3) and is currently moving DOWN. The player can choose directions LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN (since reversing to UP is not allowed). \n\n- **Moving DOWN**: The head would move to (row 3, column 3), a safe empty space but no apple is eaten.  \n- **Moving LEFT**: The head would move to (row 2, column 2), a safe empty space but no apple is eaten.  \n- **Moving RIGHT**: The head would move to (row 2, column 4), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1, and the snake grows in length. This move is safe (no collision with walls or self) and directly contributes to the goal of eating apples.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  SSSA#\n#  SH  #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: Head (H) is at (row 2, column 4).

The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid).\n- **Apples**: Located at (1,6), (4,5), and (6,6).\n- **Collision Risks**: The snake loses if it hits walls (edges) or its own body.\n\n### Possible Moves:\n1. **UP**: New head position (1,4) is occupied by the snake's body (S). Collision → invalid.\n2. **LEFT**: Reverse of current direction (RIGHT) → invalid.\n3. **RIGHT**: New head position (2,5) is empty (safe). No collision. This move allows the snake to approach the apple at (1,6).\n4. **DOWN**: New head position (3,4) is empty (safe). No collision. This move allows the snake to approach the apple at (4,5).\n\n### Analysis of Safe Moves:\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT to (2,5) is safe. From here, the snake can continue RIGHT to (2,6) (safe), then UP to (1,6) (apple), enabling it to eat the apple in 3 moves.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN to (3,4) is safe. From here, the snake can continue DOWN to (4,4) (safe), then RIGHT to (4,5) (apple), also enabling it to eat the apple in 3 moves.\n\nBoth RIGHT and DOWN are valid, but **RIGHT** directly positions the snake to reach the nearest apple (1,6) with a clear path, avoiding immediate risks.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  SS A#\n#  SSH #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (2,4) (row 2, column 4) with a current direction of RIGHT.

The closest apple is (1,5) (row 1, column 5).\n2. **Possible Moves**: From the current head position (2,4), valid directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (LEFT is reversed and invalid).\n   - **UP**: Moves head to (1,4) (safe, no collision).

This would cause a wall collision and end the game.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (1,6), which contains an apple ('A'). This is safe (no wall or self-collision) and will increase the score by 1.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (3,6), an empty space.

Valid options are LEFT, UP, or DOWN.\n\n### Evaluation of Each Direction:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP from (1,5) would take the head to (0,5). Row 0 is a wall (all '#'s), so this results in a wall collision. **Invalid**.\n2. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (1,5) would take the head to (2,5). Row 2, column 5 is occupied by the snake's body ('S'), so this results in a self-collision. **Invalid**.\n3. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (1,5) takes the head to (1,4).

This causes a wall collision, ending the game.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (2,4), which is occupied by the snake's body (row 2, column 4 is 'S'). This causes a self-collision, ending the game.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (1,3), which is an empty space (no wall or body collision).

Possible directions: UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT.\n- **Apples**: Located at (4,4), (5,5), (6,5) (lower half of the board).\n- **Goal**: Move toward apples while avoiding walls and self-collision.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Directions:\n1. **UP**: Next head position would be (0,3), which is a wall (row 0 is all '#'). Collision occurs. Invalid.\n2. **LEFT**: Next head position is (1,2) (empty, no collision). However, this moves the snake left (away from apples in the lower right). Not optimal for reaching apples.\n3. **DOWN**: Next head position is (2,3) (empty, no collision). This moves the snake downward, closer to the apples in rows 4–6. This direction aligns with reaching the apples faster.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN is safe and positions the snake to approach the apples in subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  SSSS#\n#  H  S#\n#      #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (row 2, column 2), and the current direction is DOWN.

However, the next move left would reach (2, 0), a wall, causing a collision. This is risky.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving right would take the head to (2, 3), which is safe. However, continuing right could lead to (2, 5), which is part of the snake's body (S), causing a collision. This path is also risky.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving down takes the head to (3, 2), which is empty (no walls or body segments). This direction keeps the snake moving toward the lower half of the board, where apples are located (positions (4,4), (5,5), (6,5)). From (3,2), the snake can later turn right to approach the apples safely.  \n\nThus, the safest and most strategic choice is to continue moving DOWN. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  SSSS#\n#  S   #\n#  H   #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#     A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The head (H) is at (row 3, column 2).

The snake cannot reverse to UP.\n- **Apples**: Located at (row 4, column 4), (row 5, column 5), and (row 6, column 5).\n- **Collision Risks**: The snake must avoid walls (edges) and self-collision.\n\n### Possible Moves:\n1. **DOWN**: Next head position = (row 4, column 2). This is safe (no wall\/body collision). From here, moving RIGHT would lead toward the apple at (row 4, column 4).\n2. **LEFT**: Next head position = (row 3, column 1). Safe but moves away from apples, requiring more steps to reach them.\n3. **RIGHT**: Next head position = (row 3, column 3). Safe (no collision) and brings the head closer to the apple at (row 4, column 4). From (row 3, column 3), moving DOWN then RIGHT would reach the apple quickly.\n\n### Optimal Choice:\nMoving RIGHT positions the head closer to the nearest apple (row 4, column 4) and avoids unnecessary detours.

The possible directions to choose are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n### Analysis of possible moves:\n- **RIGHT**: The head would move to (4, 6), which is an empty space. No apple is present here, so no score increase.\n- **UP**: The head would move to (3, 5), which is an empty space (row 3: \"#  SSA #\" → column 5 is empty). No apple here, so no score increase.\n- **DOWN**: The head would move to (5, 5). Row 5 is \"#     A#\", where column 5 is an apple ('A'). Moving DOWN here allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score by 1. The new head position (5, 5) is valid (not a wall or part of the snake's body), so this move is safe.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN is the optimal choice, as it directly leads to eating an apple and increasing the score.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n#  SSA #\n#   SS #\n#    HA#\n#     A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current state:\n- The snake's head 'H' is at position (5, 4) (row 5, column 4).\n- Current direction is DOWN; the snake cannot reverse to UP, but can turn LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.\n- Apples ('A') are at (3, 5), (5, 5), and (6, 5).\n\n### Analysis of possible directions:\n1. **DOWN**: Moving down would take the head to (6, 4), which is empty (no apple). This does not increase the score and offers no immediate benefit.\n2. **LEFT**: Moving left would take the head to (5, 3), which is empty (no apple). This also does not increase the score.\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving right would take the head to (5, 5), which is occupied by an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1, grows the snake, and avoids collision with walls or the snake's body (since (5, 5) is not a wall or part of the snake's body).\n\nMoving RIGHT is the best choice as it allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, maximizing the score.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n#  SSA #\n#A  SS #\n#    SH#\n#     A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n- **Snake Head Position**: (Row 5, Column 5) (denoted by 'H').\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT.\n- **Possible Directions**: The snake cannot reverse direction (LEFT is invalid).

This causes a collision, ending the game. **Invalid**.\n\n2. **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to row 5, column 4. Checking the board, row 5, column 4 is empty (no wall or snake body).

No collision occurs.\n\n3. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to row 6, column 3. This cell is empty (no wall or snake body). The new head position (6,3) is not occupied by the snake’s body. This move is also safe.\n\n### Strategy for Apple Collection:\nThe nearest apples are at (5,2), (4,1), and (3,5). The closest is (5,2) (Manhattan distance 3 from the current head). Moving UP or LEFT both reduce the distance to this apple to 2. However, continuing in the current direction (LEFT) avoids unnecessary direction changes and keeps the snake moving into open space (row 6, column 3 is empty and not blocked by the body).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SSA #\n#A  SS #\n# A  SS#\n#   HSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (6, 3) (row 6, column 3).

The goal is to choose a safe direction (LEFT, UP, or DOWN) that avoids collisions with walls or the snake's body and maximizes apple consumption.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Directions:\n1. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (7, 3), which is a wall (row 7 is all '#'). This causes an immediate collision, ending the game. **Invalid**.\n   \n2. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (5, 3). Checking the board, (5, 3) is a space (no wall or body segment). This is safe but does not eat an apple. After moving UP, the next possible direction could be LEFT to reach the apple at (5, 2) in the next epoch.\n\n3. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (6, 2). Checking the board, (6, 2) is a space (no wall or body segment). This is safe and does not eat an apple. After moving LEFT, the next possible direction could be UP to reach the apple at (5, 2) in the next epoch.\n\n### Key Consideration:\nThe closest apple is at (5, 2). Both UP and LEFT are safe, but moving LEFT positions the snake to reach (5, 2) in the next epoch (by moving UP from (6, 2)). This path avoids walls and self-collision.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SA #\n#A  SS #\n# A  SS#\n#  HSSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (row 6, column 3) and is currently moving LEFT.

(4,2) does not contain an apple, but this direction moves the head closer to the apple at (4,1) (row 4, column 1), which is the nearest apple.\n\n### Strategy:\nThe goal is to eat apples. The closest apple is at (4,1). Moving UP positions the head at (4,2), from which the next move (LEFT) can reach (4,1) to eat the apple. This path avoids the snake's body and walls.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n# A    #\n#    A #\n#AH  S #\n# SS SS#\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, we analyze the snake's position, current direction, and potential moves:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at (row 4, column 2).\n- Current direction is UP, so the snake cannot reverse to DOWN. Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n- **Moving UP**: The next position would be (row 3, column 2), which is empty (no apple or collision). This does not gain a score.\n- **Moving RIGHT**: The next position would be (row 4, column 3), which is empty (no apple or collision). This does not gain a score.\n- **Moving LEFT**: The next position is (row 4, column 1), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1 and allows the snake to grow. This move is safe (no collision with walls or the snake's body).\n\nThus, the optimal direction is LEFT, as it safely captures an apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n# AA   #\n#    A #\n#HS  S #\n# SS SS#\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is located at row 4, column 1 (0-indexed). The current direction is LEFT, so the snake cannot reverse to RIGHT. The possible directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. \n\n- **LEFT**: Moving left would take the head to (4, 0), which is a wall (column 0 is '#'). This causes a collision, ending the game. Thus, LEFT is invalid.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving down would take the head to (5, 1). Row 5 at column 1 is empty, so this is safe. However, from (5, 1), moving right would hit the snake's body (row 5, column 2 is 'S'), limiting future movement options.  \n- **UP**: Moving up would take the head to (3, 1). Row 3 at column 1 is empty, so this is safe. From (3, 1), moving right can lead toward apples at (3, 4) (row 3, column 4) and (2, 2)\/(2, 3) (row 2, columns 2 and 3), providing a viable path to collect apples.  \n\nUP is the best choice as it avoids immediate collision and allows a path toward apples. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#      #\n# AA   #\n#H   A #\n#SS    #\n# SS SS#\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row=3, column=1) (0-indexed).\n2. **Current Direction**: The snake is moving UP. It cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid).\n3. **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (row=2, column=2), (row=2, column=3), and (row=3, column=4).\n4. **Body Positions**: The body 'S' segments are in rows 4, 5, and 6 (lower half of the board), so the upper half (rows 0-3) is currently free of body collisions.\n\n### Direction Analysis:\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (row=3, column=0), which is a wall (column 0 is a wall in all rows). This causes an immediate collision and game over. **Invalid**.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (row=3, column=2). This is a safe empty space but does not reach an apple. While safe, it is less optimal for reaching apples quickly.\n- **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (row=2, column=1). This position is safe (not a wall or body) and positions the snake to reach the nearest apple at (row=2, column=2) in the next move (by then turning RIGHT). This path allows the snake to eat an apple sooner.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP is safe, avoids collisions, and strategically positions the snake to reach an apple in the next step.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#      #\n#HAA   #\n#S   A #\n#SS    #\n# SS  S#\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Current Direction**: UP (snake cannot reverse to DOWN).\n2. **Snake Head Position**: (2,1) (row 2, column 1, 0-indexed).\n3. **Possible Moves**: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is invalid as it reverses direction).\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n- **UP**: Next head position is (1,1). This cell is empty (no wall or body), so safe. However, there is no apple here, so the snake does not grow.\n- **LEFT**: Next head position is (2,0). Column 0 is a wall (`#`), so this move causes a wall collision. Game over. Invalid.\n- **RIGHT**: Next head position is (2,2). This cell contains an apple (`A`). No body parts are present here, so safe. Eating the apple increases the score by 1 and grows the snake.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT is the only safe direction that allows the snake to eat an apple and grow, making it the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   A  #\n#SHA   #\n#S   A #\n#SS    #\n# SS  S#\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is located at row 2, column 2.

This is safe (not a wall or snake body), and eating the apple will increase the score and grow the snake.\n- **UP**: The next position is row 1, column 2 (empty space), no apple.\n- **DOWN**: The next position is row 3, column 2 (empty space), no apple.\n\nMoving RIGHT is optimal as it allows the snake to eat an apple safely.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#   A  #\n#SSH   #\n#SA  A #\n#SS    #\n# SS  S#\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at position (row 2, column 3).\n- Current direction is RIGHT, so the snake cannot reverse to LEFT. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n- Apples ('A') are located at (row 1, column 3), (row 3, column 2), and (row 3, column 4).\n- The snake's body ('S') occupies various positions, but none are at (row 1, column 3).\n\n**Direction Evaluation:**\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (row 2, column 4), which is empty (no apple, safe but no score gain).\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (row 3, column 3), which is empty (no apple, safe but no score gain).\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (row 1, column 3), which contains an apple ('A'). This is safe (no collision with walls or body) and would increase the score by 1.\n\nThus, the best direction is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#  HA  #\n#SSS   #\n#SA  A #\n#SS    #\n# SS   #\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nThe current direction is UP, and the snake's head is at (row 1, column 3). The snake cannot reverse direction, so the possible directions to choose are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to row 0, column 3, which is a wall (row 0 is entirely walls). This would cause a collision and end the game. Thus, UP is invalid.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (row 1, column 2), which is an empty space (no walls or snake body). This is safe but does not eat an apple.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (row 1, column 4), which contains an apple ('A'). This position is not a wall or part of the snake's body, so it is safe. Eating the apple would increase the score and grow the snake.  \n\nTo maximize the score, the optimal choice is to move RIGHT and eat the apple. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  SH  #\n#SSS   #\n#SAA A #\n#SS    #\n# SS   #\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is located at position (row 1, column 4), and the current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so the possible moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP from (1,4) would take the head to (0,4), which is a wall (row 0 is entirely walls). This causes a collision, so UP is invalid.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (1,4) would take the head to (2,4). Row 2 (columns 4-6) is empty (' '), so this position is safe (no wall or self-collision).  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (1,4) would take the head to (1,5). Row 1 (column 5) is empty (' '), so this position is also safe (no wall or self-collision).  \n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT are valid, but the goal is to maximize apple consumption. The apples ('A') are in row 3 (columns 2, 3, 5). Moving RIGHT keeps the snake aligned with column 5, which contains an apple in row 3 (position (3,5)). This path allows the snake to approach the apple in row 3 by moving DOWN in subsequent steps. Since RIGHT is safe and aligns with a future apple, it is the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  SSH #\n#SSS   #\n#SAA A #\n#SS    #\n# SS   #\n#  SSS #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (1,5) (row 1, column 5) and is currently moving RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so LEFT is invalid. \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (0,5), which is a wall (row 0 is all '#'). This causes a collision, ending the game. Invalid.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (2,5) (row 2, column 5), which is empty (no collision). From (2,5), the next move (if direction remains DOWN) would reach (3,5), where an apple ('A') is located. This allows the snake to eat the apple in the next epoch.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (1,6), which is empty. However, (1,7) (next RIGHT move) is a wall, limiting future movement. This path is less optimal for reaching apples compared to DOWN.\n\nThe best choice is DOWN, as it leads the snake toward an apple in the next steps without collision.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  SSS #\n#SSS H #\n#SAA A #\n#SS    #\n# SS   #\n#  SS  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (row 2, column 5). The current direction is DOWN, so the next move in the current direction would take the head to (row 3, column 5). Checking this position on the board, row 3, column 5 contains an apple ('A'), which is safe (not a wall or snake body). Moving DOWN allows the snake to eat the apple, increase the score, and grow safely. Other directions (LEFT or RIGHT) would lead to potential collisions with the snake's body or walls in subsequent moves. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#  SSS #\n#SSS S #\n#SAA H #\n#SS   A#\n# SS   #\n#  SS  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 3, column 5).\n- **Current Direction**: DOWN (snake cannot reverse to UP).\n- **Apples**: Located at (3,2), (3,3), and (4,6).\n- **Goal**: Eat apples safely without collision.\n\n### Possible Directions (non-reversing):\n- **DOWN**: Continue moving down to (4,5). This is safe (empty space) but does not immediately reach an apple.\n- **LEFT**: Turn left to (3,4). This is safe (empty space) and positions the head to reach the apple at (3,3) in the next move.\n- **RIGHT**: Turn right to (3,6). This is safe (empty space) but does not lead directly to an apple.\n\n### Optimal Path:\nMoving **LEFT** (to (3,4)) allows the snake to:\n1. Avoid collision (no walls or body segments at (3,4)).\n2. Position the head to reach the apple at (3,3) in the next epoch (direction LEFT again), followed by the apple at (3,2) in the subsequent epoch.

No collision with walls or itself.  \n\nChoosing DOWN allows the snake to eat an apple, grow, and increase the score. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#    A #\n# SS   #\n# H    #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (row 5, column 1) (assuming rows are 0-indexed from top to bottom and columns 0-indexed from left to right). The current direction is DOWN, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so UP is invalid). The snake must choose between LEFT, RIGHT, or continuing DOWN.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Directions:\n1. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (5,1) would take the head to (5,0), which is a wall (column 0 is a wall for all rows). This would cause an immediate collision with the wall, ending the game. **LEFT is invalid**.\n\n2. **UP**: The current direction is DOWN, so reversing to UP is not allowed. **UP is invalid**.\n\n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (5,1) takes the head to (6,1). Row 6, column 1 is empty (no wall or body part), so this is safe. However, there is no apple at (6,1), so the snake does not grow, and the score remains unchanged.\n\n4. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (5,1) takes the head to (5,2). Row 5, column 2 is empty (no wall or body part), so this is safe. While there is no apple at (5,2), moving RIGHT positions the snake closer to the apples located at (2,2), (2,5), and (3,4) (all in higher columns), making it easier to reach them in subsequent moves.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT is safe and strategically better, as it positions the snake closer to the apples. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#    A #\n# S    #\n# SH   #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's position, current direction (RIGHT), and the locations of apples ('A'). The snake's head ('H') is at (row 5, column 2), with body segments ('S') at (5,1) and (4,1). Apples are at (2,2), (2,5), and (3,4). The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid), leaving UP, DOWN, or RIGHT as options.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Directions:\n1. **RIGHT**: Continuing RIGHT moves the head to (5,3). This is a safe move (no collision with walls\/body) but does not reach an apple immediately. The snake would need additional moves to approach apples, making this less efficient.\n   \n2. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (6,2). This moves the snake away from all apples (located in rows 2–3), making it an inefficient choice.\n\n3. **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (4,2). This is a safe move (no collision) and positions the snake to approach the closest apple at (2,2). From (4,2), subsequent UP moves can reach (3,2) and then (2,2) (the apple) in 2 additional steps, making this the most direct path to an apple.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP allows the snake to efficiently approach the nearest apple at (2,2) with minimal steps. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#    A #\n#  H   #\n# SS   #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (4, 2) (row 4, column 2) and is currently moving UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid), leaving UP, LEFT, or RIGHT as possible choices. \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (3, 2). This position is empty (no walls or body segments) and safe. From (3, 2), the next move (if continuing UP) would reach (2, 2) in the next epoch, which contains an apple ('A'). This path directly leads to an apple, making it optimal.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (4, 1). This position is safe but does not lead toward any apples in the immediate next steps.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (4, 3). This position is safe but also does not lead toward apples as directly as UP.  \n\nContinuing UP allows the snake to reach an apple in the next epoch, maximizing score growth. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#  H A #\n#  S   #\n#  S   #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (3, 2) (row 3, column 2) and is currently moving UP. The possible directions to choose are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (since reversing to DOWN is not allowed). \n\n- **Moving UP**: The head moves to (2, 2), which is an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score by 1 and the snake grows. The new head position (2, 2) is within the board (no wall collision) and does not overlap with the snake's body (current body segments are at (4, 2) and (5, 2), so no self-collision). This is a safe and beneficial move.  \n- **Moving LEFT**: The head moves to (3, 1), which is empty. No apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow. This does not improve the score.  \n- **Moving RIGHT**: The head moves to (3, 3), which is empty. No apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow. This also does not improve the score.  \n\nThe optimal choice is to continue moving UP to eat the apple at (2, 2).\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#  H  A#\n#  S A #\n#  S   #\n#  SA  #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (row 2, column 3), moving UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **UP**: Next head position is (1, 3), which is empty (no apple, no collision).  \n- **LEFT**: Next head position is (2, 2), which is empty (no apple, no collision).  \n- **RIGHT**: Next head position is (2, 4), which is empty (no apple, no collision).  \n\nTo maximize apple collection, moving RIGHT is optimal. From (2, 4), the snake can then move DOWN (allowed, as RIGHT → DOWN is not a reversal) to reach the apple at (3, 4) in the next epoch. This path avoids collision and positions the snake to eat an apple soon.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#  SH A#\n#  S A #\n#  S   #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (row 2, column 4). The current direction is RIGHT, so the snake cannot reverse to LEFT. The possible directions to choose are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n### Analysis of each possible direction:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (row 1, column 4). This position is empty (safe), but row 1 is near the top wall (row 0 is all '#'). If the snake continues moving UP, it would collide with the wall in the next step. This is risky.\n2. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (row 2, column 5) (empty, safe). The next move (if continuing RIGHT) would reach (row 2, column 6), which contains an apple ('A'). However, (row 2, column 6) is adjacent to the right wall (column 7 is '#'), limiting future movement options.\n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (row 3, column 4) (empty, safe). The next move (if changing direction to RIGHT) would reach (row 3, column 5), which contains an apple ('A'). This apple is in a more central position (farther from walls), providing more flexibility for future movements.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN allows the snake to safely approach an apple in the next step while avoiding immediate wall collisions and leaving more space for future movement. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#  SS A#\n#  SHA #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n- **Snake Head (H) Position**: (3, 3) (row 3, column 3).\n- **Current Direction**: DOWN (snake is moving downward).\n- **Apple Positions**: (2, 5), (3, 4), (5, 3).\n- **Constraints**: The snake cannot reverse direction (UP is invalid as it would reverse from DOWN). Valid directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Directions:\n1. **LEFT**: Next head position would be (3, 2). This square is occupied by the snake’s body (S), causing a self-collision. The game would end. **Invalid**.\n2. **RIGHT**: Next head position is (3, 4), which contains an apple (A). Moving RIGHT allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score by 1 and growing the snake. No collision occurs. **Valid and beneficial**.\n3. **DOWN**: Next head position is (4, 3), an empty square. No apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow. **Valid but less optimal**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple, grow, and increase the score. This is the best choice.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#  SS A#\n#  SSH #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The head ('H') is at (row 3, column 4). The body ('S') segments are at (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3).\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid).\n- **Apples**: Located at (2,5), (5,3), and (6,2). The closest apple is at (2,5) (row 2, column 5).\n- **Possible Moves**: The snake can move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (since LEFT is a reverse direction and invalid).\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **RIGHT (Current Direction)**:\n   - Next head position: (3,5) (row 3, column 5), which is empty (no collision with walls or self).\n   - After moving RIGHT, the snake’s body shifts, and the tail (2,2) is removed. The new body segments become (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (2,3), with the head at (3,5).\n   - From (3,5), the snake can then move UP to (2,5) (the apple at row 2, column 5) in the next epoch, allowing it to eat the apple.\n\n2. **UP**:\n   - Next head position: (2,4) (row 2, column 4), which is empty (no collision).\n   - After moving UP, the body shifts, and the tail (2,2) is removed. The new body segments become (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (2,3), with the head at (2,4).\n   - From (2,4), the snake can then move RIGHT to (2,5) (the apple) in the next epoch.\n\n3. **DOWN**:\n   - Next head position: (4,4) (row 4, column 4), which is empty (no collision).\n   - This move takes the snake away from the closest apple (2,5) and toward apples at (5,3) and (6,2), which are farther.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT keeps the snake on a path toward the closest apple (2,5) with minimal deviation. After moving RIGHT to (3,5), the snake can then move UP to (2,5) to eat the apple in the next epoch. This path is safe and efficient.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#  SS A#\n#   SSH#\n#      #\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is located at (row 3, column 6).

This would cause a collision and end the game.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (1,6), which is a wall. This would also cause a collision.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (1,4). This position is empty (not a wall or part of the snake's body), so it is safe.  \n\nThus, the only valid direction to avoid collision is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#    HS#\n#     S#\n#   SSS#\n#     A#\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (row 1, column 5). The current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). Let's analyze possible moves:\n\n- **UP**: Moving up would take the head to row 0, column 5, which is a wall (row 0 is all '#'). This causes a collision with the wall, ending the game.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving down would take the head to row 2, column 5. Row 2, column 5 is 'S' (snake's body), leading to a self-collision and game over.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving left takes the head to row 1, column 4, which is empty (no wall or body collision). This is safe.  \n\nThe only valid and safe direction is LEFT. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   HSS#\n#     S#\n#    SS#\n#     A#\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. The snake’s head is at (1,4) (row 1, column 4), moving LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (RIGHT is invalid). We evaluate valid directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT):\n\n### 1. UP:  \nMoving UP would take the head to (0,4), which is a wall (row 0 is all '#'). This causes a collision, so UP is invalid.  \n\n### 2. LEFT:  \nMoving LEFT takes the head to (1,3), which is empty (no wall or body). While safe, this direction leads the snake toward the left edge (row 1, column 0 is a wall) and does not immediately approach apples.  \n\n### 3. DOWN:  \nMoving DOWN takes the head to (2,4), which is empty (no wall or body). This direction guides the snake toward the lower half of the board, where apples are located at (4,5), (5,3), and (6,2).  \n\n### Path to Apples:  \n- **(4,5) Apple**: After moving DOWN to (2,4), subsequent moves DOWN to (3,4), (4,4), and RIGHT to (4,5) (an apple) are safe and direct. This path reaches an apple in 4 steps.  \n- **(5,3) Apple**: A longer path via LEFT first would take 5 steps, making (4,5) the closer target.  \n\nMoving DOWN is safer and more efficient for reaching an apple.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   SSS#\n#   H S#\n#     S#\n#     A#\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The head ('H') is at (row 2, column 3).

This position is empty (no wall or body collision). Continuing DOWN from (3,3) leads to (4,3) (empty) and then (5,3) (an apple). This path reaches the closest apple (5,3) in 3 steps.\n2. **LEFT**: The head moves to (2,2). This position is safe but does not directly lead toward any apple quickly.\n3. **RIGHT**: The head moves to (2,4).

Eating this apple will increase the score by 1, and the snake will grow. The new head position (5,3) is within the board (no wall collision) and does not overlap with the snake's body (current body segments are at (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)), so this move is safe.  \n- **Moving LEFT**: The head would move to (4,2), which is an empty space.

Colliding with the wall ends the game. Invalid.\n- **LEFT**: The next position is (6, 2), which contains an apple ('A').

Checking (4,2) on the board: it is empty (no wall or snake body). This is safe. No apple is present here, so the snake moves without growing but avoids collision.\n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (5,1). Checking (5,1): it is empty (no wall or snake body). This is safe. No apple is present here, so the snake moves without growing.\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (5,3), which is occupied by the snake's body (S). This causes a collision, ending the game. **Invalid**.\n4. **DOWN**: Reversing the current direction (UP → DOWN) is not allowed. **Invalid**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth UP and LEFT are safe, but UP maintains the current direction and avoids potential wall collisions in subsequent moves (e.g., moving LEFT could lead to (5,0) in the next step, which is a wall).

(4,1) does not contain an apple, but it places the head one step away from the apple at (3,1) (requires a subsequent UP move).\n\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head from (4,2) to (4,3). This position is empty (no walls or body segments), so it is safe. However, (4,3) does not contain an apple, and this direction moves the head away from the nearest apples.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The closest apples are at (3,1), (2,5), and (4,5). The apple at (3,1) is the nearest and most accessible.\n- Moving LEFT positions the head closer to (3,1) (one step away via UP in the next move), while moving UP also positions the head one step away (via LEFT in the next move). Both paths are safe, but LEFT directly reduces the horizontal distance to the nearest apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#A     #\n#HS S A#\n# S S  #\n# SSS  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (4, 2) (row 4, column 2) and is currently moving LEFT.

This square is empty (no apple or body), so the snake moves without eating, but no immediate benefit.  \n- **UP**: The next position would be (3, 2). This square contains an apple ('A'). Moving here would allow the snake to eat the apple, increase the score by 1, and grow in length. The square (3, 2) is not occupied by the snake's body or a wall, so it is safe.  \n- **DOWN**: The next position would be (5, 2). This square is occupied by the snake's body ('S'), causing a self-collision and ending the game.  \n\nThe optimal choice is to move UP to eat the apple and avoid collision. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#H   A #\n#SS S A#\n# S S  #\n# SSS  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (3,1) (row 3, column 1), with the current direction being UP. The snake cannot reverse direction, so DOWN is invalid. The possible directions to consider are UP, LEFT, and RIGHT. \n\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (3,0), which is a wall (column 0 is a wall). This causes a collision, ending the game. Thus, LEFT is invalid.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (2,1), which is an empty space (no collision with walls or the snake's body). This is safe but does not reach an apple immediately.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (3,2), which is an empty space (no collision with walls or the snake's body). This is safe and starts moving the snake toward the apple at (3,4), which is 3 steps to the right (columns 1→2→3→4). This path is viable and leads toward a nearby apple.  \n\nGiven that RIGHT is safe and directs the snake toward an apple, it is the optimal choice.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#SH  A #\n#SS   A#\n# S S  #\n# SSS  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 2) (row 3, column 2), and the current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). We need to check possible directions (RIGHT, UP, DOWN) for safety and apple access:\n\n1. **RIGHT**: The next head position is (3, 3). This cell is empty (no walls or body segments), so it is safe. Moving RIGHT allows the snake to approach the apple at (3, 5) in subsequent steps (next moves to (3, 4) then (3, 5)).\n\n2. **UP**: The next head position is (2, 2). This cell is empty (no walls or body segments), so it is safe. However, reaching the nearest apple at (2, 5) would require more steps (moving RIGHT multiple times).\n\n3. **DOWN**: The next head position is (4, 2), which is occupied by a body segment ('S'). This would cause a self-collision, ending the game. Thus, DOWN is invalid.\n\nBetween the valid options (RIGHT and UP), moving RIGHT leads the snake directly toward an apple (at (3, 5)) in fewer steps, making it the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#SSH A #\n#SS   A#\n# S    #\n# SSS  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 3, column 3).\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT (snake is moving right; cannot reverse to LEFT).\n- **Apple Positions**: Apples ('A') are at (row 2, column 6), (row 3, column 5), and (row 4, column 6).\n- **Body Positions**: The snake's body ('S') occupies (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4).\n\n### Valid Moves (Cannot Reverse Direction):\n1. **RIGHT**: Next head position is (3,4). This cell is empty (no wall\/body), so safe. Moving RIGHT now positions the snake to reach the apple at (3,5) in the next step (epoch 29).\n2. **UP**: Next head position is (2,3).

The goal of the game is to control the snake, eat as many apples as possible, and grow the snake in length. Each time the snake eats an apple, the score increases by one. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs.

The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n- **UP**: The head moves to (3,3) (row 3, column 3), which is empty. However, continuing UP would eventually lead the snake toward row 0 (a wall), risking collision after several steps.  \n- **LEFT**: The head moves to (4,2) (row 4, column 2), which is empty. This direction starts moving the snake toward the apples at (2,1) and (1,1) (upper-left corner), avoiding walls and creating a path to reach these apples in subsequent steps.  \n- **RIGHT**: The head moves to (4,4) (row 4, column 4), which is empty. This direction starts moving toward the apple at (5,6) (lower-right corner), but this path requires more lateral movement before reaching the apple.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT is optimal as it directs the snake toward the clustered apples at (2,1) and (1,1) in the upper-left, avoiding wall collisions and setting up a clear path to eat apples in future epochs.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# A    #\n#A     #\n#      #\n# H    #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (row 4, column 2) with a current direction of LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). We need to choose a safe direction (UP, DOWN, or LEFT) that avoids collisions and ideally leads toward an apple.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (4,1) (safe for this move). However, the next move in the same direction would take it to (4,0), which is a wall (collision). This is unsafe long-term.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (5,2) (safe for this move). The next move in the same direction would take it to (6,2), then (7,2) (a wall). This also leads to a collision.\n- **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (3,2) (safe). This direction allows the snake to continue moving toward the apple at (1,2) (same column, higher row) in subsequent moves without immediate collision risk.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n# A    #\n#A     #\n# H    #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (row 3, column 2), and the current direction is UP. The snake can move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (since reversing to DOWN is not allowed). The goal is to eat apples safely. \n\nKey observations:\n- Apples are located at (row 1, column 2), (row 2, column 1), and (row 5, column 5).\n- Moving UP would take the head to (row 2, column 2), a safe empty cell but not an apple.\n- Moving LEFT would take the head to (row 3, column 1), a safe empty cell. From there, the next move (with direction LEFT) could be UP to reach (row 2, column 1), which contains an apple. This path allows the snake to eat an apple in the next epoch.\n- Moving RIGHT would take the head to (row 3, column 3), a safe empty cell but not leading directly to an apple.\n\nThe optimal choice is to move LEFT, as it positions the snake to reach the nearest apple (row 2, column 1) in the next move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# A    #\n#A     #\n#H     #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is LEFT, and the current epoch is 4. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). The snake's head is at (3, 1) (row 3, column 1). \n\n- Moving LEFT would take the head to (3, 0), which is a wall (column 0 is a wall), causing a collision. This is invalid.\n- Moving DOWN would take the head to (4, 1), which is an empty space (no apple, no collision). This is safe but does not eat an apple.\n- Moving UP would take the head to (2, 1), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1, grows the snake, and avoids collision.\n\nThe best move is to go UP to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# A    #\n#H     #\n#S     #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving UP. The head (H) is at position (2,1) (row 2, column 1), and the body (S) is at (3,1). The possible directions to move are UP, LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN, but the snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid as the current direction is UP). \n\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (2,1) would take the head to (2,0), which is a wall (collision, game over).  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (2,1) would take the head to (2,2), an empty space (no apple, safe but no score gain).  \n- **UP**: Moving UP from (2,1) takes the head to (1,1), which contains an apple (A). Eating the apple is safe (no collision with walls or self), increases the score by 1, and the snake grows in length.  \n\nThe optimal choice is to move UP to eat the apple and grow. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#HA    #\n#S     #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP. The snake's head (H) is at (1,1), and the body (S) is at (2,1). The snake is moving upward, but moving UP further would hit the wall at (0,1), causing a collision. Reversing direction to DOWN is not allowed. Moving LEFT would take the head to (1,0), which is a wall. The only valid direction is RIGHT, which moves the head to (1,2) (an apple). Eating this apple will grow the snake and increase the score without collision.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#SH A  #\n#S     #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The snake's head ('H') is at (row 1, column 2). The body ('S') segments are at (row 1, column 1) and (row 2, column 1). The snake is currently moving RIGHT.\n- **Apples**: Apples ('A') are located at (row 1, column 4), (row 4, column 4), and (row 5, column 5).\n- **Collision Rules**: The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., RIGHT → LEFT). It loses if it hits walls (row 0 or 7, column 0 or 7) or its own body.\n\n### Direction Analysis:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (row 0, column 2), which is a wall (row 0 is the top boundary). This causes an immediate collision. **Invalid**.\n2. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (row 2, column 2). This cell is empty (no collision with walls or body), but it does not lead toward the nearest apple (row 1, column 4). **Safe but suboptimal**.\n3. **LEFT**: Reversing direction (current direction is RIGHT → LEFT is invalid). **Not allowed**.\n4. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (row 1, column 3). This cell is empty (no collision). Continuing RIGHT in subsequent moves will reach the nearest apple at (row 1, column 4) in the next step (epoch 8 → epoch 9), allowing the snake to eat the apple and grow. **Optimal**.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SSHA  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving RIGHT and cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). Let's analyze possible directions:\n\n- **UP**: The head is at (1,3). Moving UP would take it to (0,3), which is a wall (top edge). Collision with the wall, game over. Invalid.\n- **DOWN**: The head would move to (2,3), which is empty (safe). No apple here, so no score gain.\n- **RIGHT**: The head would move to (1,4), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score by 1, and the snake grows. No collision with walls or self (new head at (1,4) is within bounds, and the body is at (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), which are not overlapping with the new head). Safe and beneficial.\n\nThe best choice is to continue moving RIGHT to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SSSH  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#  A   #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (1, 4) (row 1, column 4), with its body (S) at (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3). The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse to LEFT. The apples are located at (4, 4), (5, 5), and (6, 2).\n\nAnalyzing possible directions:\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (0, 4), which is a wall (row 0 is the top boundary). This causes a collision, so UP is invalid.\n- **LEFT**: Reversing direction (RIGHT → LEFT) is not allowed, so LEFT is invalid.\n- **RIGHT**: Continuing RIGHT moves the head to (1, 5), a safe empty space. However, this does not lead toward the nearest apple and delays reaching apples.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (2, 4), a safe empty space. This direction aligns with the nearest apple at (4, 4) (row 4, column 4). From (2, 4), the snake can continue moving DOWN to (3, 4) and then (4, 4) to eat the apple, growing the snake and increasing the score.\n\nChoosing DOWN allows the snake to move toward the closest apple efficiently and safely.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# SSS  #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#  A   #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (2, 3) (row 2, column 3). The body (S) occupies positions (1, 1), (1, 2), and (1, 3). The current direction is DOWN, so the snake cannot reverse to UP. Possible next directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. \n\n### Analysis of each direction:\n1. **DOWN**: New head position is (3, 3). This is a safe space (no wall or self-collision) but no apple is present here. The snake moves but does not grow.\n2. **LEFT**: New head position is (2, 2). This is a safe space but no apple is present here. The snake moves but does not grow.\n3. **RIGHT**: New head position is (2, 4). This is a safe space (no wall or self-collision) and no apple is present here, but it moves the snake closer to the nearest apple at (4, 4). Moving RIGHT now allows the snake to align with the column of the nearest apple (column 4), making it easier to reach (4, 4) in subsequent moves (e.g., DOWN to (3, 4), then DOWN to (4, 4) to eat the apple).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT is optimal as it positions the snake closer to the nearest apple at (4, 4) without risk of collision.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#  SS  #\n#   SH #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#  A   #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The snake's head 'H' is at (row 2, column 5).

This is a safe empty space but does not lead directly toward any apple.\n2. **UP**: Next head position is (row 1, column 5). This is a safe empty space but moves away from the closest apples.\n3. **DOWN**: Next head position is (row 3, column 5). This is a safe empty space and moves the snake closer to the apple at (row 5, column 5) (directly below in column 5).\n\n### Optimal Choice:\nMoving **DOWN** directs the snake toward the nearest apple at (row 5, column 5), maximizing the chance to eat an apple and grow.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   S  #\n#   SS #\n#    H #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#  A   #\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, we analyze the snake's current state and possible moves:\n\n1. **Current State**:  \n   - Snake head position: (3, 4) (row 3, column 4).  \n   - Snake body positions: (2, 4), (2, 3), (1, 3).  \n   - Current direction: DOWN.  \n   - Apples are at (4, 4), (5, 5), and (6, 2).  \n\n2. **Movement Rules**:  \n   - The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., cannot switch from DOWN to UP).  \n   - Colliding with walls (#) or its own body (S) ends the game.  \n   - Eating an apple (A) increases the score and grows the snake.  \n\n\n### Analysis of Possible Directions:\n- **DOWN**:  \n  The next head position would be (4, 4), which contains an apple (A). Moving DOWN is allowed (no reversal) and safe (no collision with walls or body). Eating the apple increases the score and grows the snake.  \n\n- **LEFT**:  \n  The next head position would be (3, 3), an empty space.

No collision occurs, but no apple is eaten.  \n\n- **UP** (invalid):  \n  Reversing direction (current direction is DOWN), so UP is not allowed.  \n\n\nThe best move is to continue moving DOWN to eat the apple at (4, 4), increasing the score and safely growing the snake.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   S  #\n#   SS #\n#    S #\n#    H #\n#     A#\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4,4) (row 4, column 4). The current direction is DOWN, so the snake cannot reverse to UP. Possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. \n\n### Analysis of each possible direction:\n1. **LEFT**: The head would move to (4,3). This position is empty (no walls or body segments), so it is safe. However, there are no apples in this direction.\n2. **RIGHT**: The head would move to (4,5). This position is empty (no walls or body segments), so it is safe. From (4,5), the next move (if directed DOWN) would reach (5,5), which contains an apple (A). This path leads directly toward an apple.\n3. **DOWN**: The head would move to (5,4). This position is empty, but there are no apples here. From (5,4), reaching the nearest apple (at (5,5)) would require an additional right move, which is less efficient than moving RIGHT first.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT is the optimal choice, as it positions the snake to reach an apple in the next epoch.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#   SS #\n#    S #\n#    SH#\n#     A#\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4,5) (row 4, column 5), and the current direction is RIGHT.

This position is empty (no wall or self-collision) but contains no apple. Safe but no score gain.  \n- **UP**: The head would move to (3,5). This position is empty (no wall or self-collision) but contains no apple. Safe but no score gain.  \n- **DOWN**: The head would move to (5,5). This position contains an apple ('A'). No wall or self-collision occurs here. Eating the apple increases the score by 1 and grows the snake.  \n\nThe optimal choice is DOWN, as it allows the snake to eat an apple and safely grow. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#   SS #\n#    S #\n#A   SS#\n#     H#\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at row 5, column 5.\n- **Current Direction**: DOWN (snake is moving downward).\n- **Next Possible Moves**: The snake cannot reverse direction (UP is invalid). Valid directions are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **DOWN**: Moving down would take the head to row 6, column 5. Checking row 6 (`#  A  A#`), column 5 is an apple ('A'). This is safe (no wall or self-collision) and will result in eating the apple, increasing the score, and growing the snake.\n2. **LEFT**: Moving left would take the head to row 5, column 4. This cell is empty (' '), no apple, and no collision, but no score gain.\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving right would take the head to row 5, column 6. This cell is empty (' '), no apple, and no collision, but no score gain.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN is the best choice, as it allows the snake to eat an apple, grow, and increase the score without risk of collision.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#   SS #\n#    S #\n#A   SS#\n#A    S#\n#  A  H#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (6,6) (row 6, column 6). The current direction is DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction, so UP is invalid. Let's analyze possible moves:\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving down would take the head to (7,6), which is a wall ('#'). This causes a collision, ending the game.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving right would take the head to (6,7), which is a wall ('#'). This also causes a collision, ending the game.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving left would take the head to (6,5). Checking the board, (6,5) is empty (no wall or snake body) and contains no apple. This is a safe move.  \n\nThe only valid and safe direction is LEFT. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#A   SS#\n#A    S#\n#  A HS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (6,5), and the current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). Let's analyze possible moves:\n\n- **UP**: Moving UP from (6,5) leads to (5,5), which is occupied by the snake's body (S). This would cause a self-collision, ending the game.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (6,5) leads to (7,5), which is a wall (#). This would cause a wall collision, ending the game.  \n- **RIGHT**: Reversing the current direction (LEFT → RIGHT) is not allowed.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (6,5) leads to (6,4), which is an empty space (no collision with walls or the snake's body). This is a safe move.  \n\nThe only valid and safe direction is LEFT. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    S #\n#A   SS#\n#A    S#\n#  AHSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (6, 3) (row 6, column 3), and the current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so RIGHT is invalid. \n\n- **DOWN** is invalid because moving down from (6, 3) would reach row 7, which is a wall (collision).  \n- **UP** would move the head to (5, 3), which is empty (no collision), but there is no apple here.  \n- **LEFT** would move the head to (6, 2), which is empty (no collision) and safe. This direction aligns with a path toward the apple at (5, 1) in subsequent moves (after moving left again to (6, 1), then up to (5, 1)).  \n\nThus, the safest and most strategic direction to reach an apple is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#    S #\n#A   SS#\n#AA   S#\n#  HSSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (6,3) (row 6, column 3), moving in the current direction LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). Possible directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. \n\n- **DOWN**: Next head position would be (7,3), which is a wall (row 7 is all '#'). Collision, game over. Invalid.  \n- **LEFT**: Next head position is (6,2) (row 6, column 2), which is a space (safe, no collision with walls\/body). No apple here.  \n- **UP**: Next head position is (5,3) (row 5, column 3), which is a space (safe, no collision with walls\/body). No apple here.  \n\nBoth LEFT and UP are safe, but UP is preferable. Moving UP positions the snake closer to the apples at (5,1), (5,2), and (4,1). From (5,3), the snake can then turn LEFT to reach (5,2) (an apple) in the next move. This path avoids potential future collisions and leads directly toward apples.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A   SS#\n#AAH  S#\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's position, current direction (UP), and available moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP; DOWN is invalid as it reverses direction). \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (5,3) (row 5, column 3).\n- **Apples**: Three apples are present at (4,1), (5,1), and (5,2).\n- **Body Segments**: The snake’s body ('S') is spread across positions (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6).\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (4,3). This position is empty (no apple), so the snake does not grow. Safe but no score gain.\n2. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (5,4). This position is empty (no apple), so the snake does not grow. Safe but no score gain.\n3. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (5,2), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1 and grows the snake. The new head position (5,2) is not a wall or body segment, so no collision occurs.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple, grow, and increase the score safely.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A A SS#\n#AHS  S#\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Position**: The head (H) is at (row 5, column 2). The current direction is LEFT.\n2. **Possible Moves**: The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). Valid options are LEFT, UP, or DOWN.\n3. **Key Observations**:\n   - **Moving LEFT**: The next head position would be (5, 1), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score and grows the snake. This position is not a wall or part of the snake's body (the body segments are at (4,5), (4,6), (5,3), (5,6), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)), so no collision occurs.\n   - **Moving UP**: The next head position would be (4, 2), which is empty. No apple is present here, so the snake does not grow.\n   - **Moving DOWN**: The next head position would be (6, 2), which is empty. No apple is present here, so the snake does not grow.\n\nMoving LEFT directly leads to eating an apple, which is the most beneficial action. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A A SS#\n#HSS  S#\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so it cannot choose RIGHT. The possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT (but LEFT leads to a wall collision). \n\nThe snake's head is at (row 5, column 1). \n\n- Moving LEFT would take the head to (5, 0), which is a wall (game ends). \n- Moving UP would take the head to (4, 1), which is an apple ('A'). This is safe (no collision with the snake's body) and would increase the score by 1. \n- Moving DOWN would take the head to (6, 1), which is empty (no apple, no collision). \n\nSince the goal is to eat apples, moving UP is optimal as it allows the snake to eat an apple and grow. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#H A SS#\n#SSS  S#\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game board, snake position, and movement constraints:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head ('H') is at (row 4, column 1) (assuming rows 0-7 top to bottom, columns 0-7 left to right).\n- **Current Direction**: UP.

This causes an immediate collision. **Invalid**.\n   \n2. **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (row 3, column 1). This cell is empty (no walls or body segments), so it is safe. However, this position does not contain an apple, and the next move would not immediately reach an apple.\n\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (row 4, column 2). This cell is empty (safe). The next move (if direction remains RIGHT) would take the head to (row 4, column 3), which contains an apple ('A'). This allows the snake to eat the apple in the next epoch, increasing the score and growing the snake.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT is the safest and most optimal choice, as it avoids collisions and sets up the snake to eat an apple in the next epoch.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#SHA  S#\n#SSS  S#\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nCurrent direction is RIGHT.

Moving UP continues toward the apple at (1,3) (directly above), which can be reached in the next move.  \n- **LEFT**: Next head position is (3,2), which is empty but does not lead directly toward an apple.  \n- **RIGHT**: Next head position is (3,4), which is empty but also does not lead directly toward an apple.  \n\nMoving UP is the safest and most direct path to an apple. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# A  A #\n#  H   #\n#  S   #\n#SSS   #\n#SSSA S#\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. The snake's head is at (2,2) (row 2, column 2), moving UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). Possible directions are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (1,1), (1,4), and (5,4).\n2. **Collision Risks**: The top wall is at row 0, and the snake’s body is concentrated below the head (rows 3-6). Moving UP repeatedly risks hitting the top wall (e.g., moving UP from (2,2) to (1,2), then UP again to (0,2) would collide with the wall).\n3. **Path to Apples**: \n   - The apple at (1,1) is closest. From (2,2), moving LEFT to (2,1) (safe, no collision) positions the snake to move UP next to (1,1) (the apple), allowing it to eat the apple in the next step.\n   - Moving RIGHT to (2,3) or UP to (1,2) does not immediately reach an apple and risks future collisions (e.g., UP to (1,2) then UP again hits the wall).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT is optimal, as it positions the snake to reach the apple at (1,1) in the next step without collision.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n# A  A #\n# HS   #\n#  S   #\n#SSS   #\n#SSSA  #\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The snake's head ('H') is at (row 2, column 1).\n- **Current Direction**: The snake is moving LEFT.

The closest apple is (5,4) (Manhattan distance 2 from (4,5)).  \n\n5. **Path to Closest Apple**:  \n   - Moving LEFT to (4,4) (current step) allows the snake to move DOWN to (5,4) (the apple) in the next step (since direction can change to DOWN from LEFT).  \n   - Other directions (UP\/DOWN) do not directly lead to the closest apple as efficiently.  \n\nThus, the best direction is LEFT.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# SS  S#\n#A S  S#\n#SSSHSS#\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Head Position**: The head ('H') is at row 4, column 4 (0-indexed).  \n2. **Current Direction**: LEFT.

This cell is empty (no collision, but no apple).  \n   - **DOWN**: Next head position is row 5, column 4. This cell contains 'A' (an apple). Eating the apple increases the score and grows the snake without collision.  \n\nMoving DOWN is the only safe and beneficial option, as it allows the snake to eat an apple without colliding with itself or walls.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# SS  S#\n#A S  S#\n#SSSSSS#\n#  AH  #\n#A     #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Head Position**: The head ('H') is at (row 5, column 3).  \n2. **Current Direction**: The snake is moving DOWN.

Valid directions are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.  \n3. **Apple Positions**: Apples ('A') are visible at (row 3, column 1), (row 5, column 2), and (row 6, column 1).  \n\n### Evaluation of Possible Directions:\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (row 6, column 3), which is an empty space. No apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (row 5, column 4), which is an empty space. No apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (row 5, column 2), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1 and allows the snake to grow in length.  \n\nThe priority is to eat apples to maximize the score. Moving LEFT directly targets an apple, making it the best choice.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# SS  S#\n#A S  S#\n#SSSSSS#\n# AHS  #\n#A     #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 5, column 2).\n2. **Current Direction**: LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid).\n3. **Possible Directions**: UP, DOWN, LEFT (since RIGHT is reversed).\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (row 4, column 2). Row 4 is `#SSSSSS#`, meaning (4,2) is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). Collision with self → **invalid**.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (row 6, column 2). Row 6 is `#A     #`, so (6,2) is empty (no collision). However, there is no apple here, so the snake would just move without eating.\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (row 5, column 1). Row 5 is `# AHS  #`, so (5,1) is an apple ('A'). This position is not part of the snake's body or walls. Eating the apple increases the score and grows the snake → **safe and beneficial**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT is the only direction that allows the snake to eat an apple safely without collision.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# SSA S#\n#A S  S#\n#SSSSSS#\n# HSS  #\n#A     #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 5, column 2).\n- **Current Direction**: LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid).\n- **Apples**: Located at (row 2, column 4), (row 3, column 1), and (row 6, column 1).\n- **Collision Risks**: The snake loses if it hits walls (`#`) or its own body (`S`).\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP from (5,2) leads to (4,2), which is occupied by the snake’s body (`S`). This causes a collision. **Invalid**.\n2. **RIGHT**: Reversing direction (LEFT → RIGHT) is not allowed. **Invalid**.\n3. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (5,2) leads to (5,1), which is a safe empty space. No apple here, but this direction avoids collision.\n4. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (5,2) leads to (6,2), which is a safe empty space. No apple here, but this direction also avoids collision.\n\n### Strategy:\nThe goal is to survive and eat apples. The closest apple is at (6,1). From the head’s current position (5,2):\n- Moving DOWN to (6,2) positions the snake one step away from the apple (6,1). The next move (LEFT) can then eat the apple.\n- Moving LEFT to (5,1) also positions the snake one step away from the apple (6,1), with the next move (DOWN) to eat it.\n\nBoth paths are valid, but **DOWN** is preferred as it avoids adjacency to the wall (column 0) after the move, providing more flexibility for future moves.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# SSA S#\n#A S  S#\n# SSSSS#\n# SSS  #\n#AH    #\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (6, 2) (row 6, column 2).  \n2. **Current Direction**: The snake is moving DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction, so UP is invalid.  \n3. **Potential Moves**:  \n   - **DOWN**: Next position would be (7, 2), which is a wall ('#'). Collision would end the game.  \n   - **UP**: Reverses the current direction (DOWN → UP), which is not allowed.  \n   - **LEFT**: Next position is (6, 1), which contains an apple ('A'). This position is not part of the snake’s body ('S'), so moving LEFT is safe and will eat the apple, increasing the score.  \n   - **RIGHT**: Next position is (6, 3), an empty space (' '). No apple is present here, so no score gain.  \n\nMoving LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple safely, which is optimal for maximizing the score.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# SSA S#\n#A S  S#\n#ASSSSS#\n# SSS  #\n#HS    #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (row 6, column 1) with the current direction LEFT.

This would cause a collision and end the game.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (4, 2), an empty space. No apple is present here, so the snake does not grow.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (3, 1), which contains an apple ('A'). This is safe (no collision with walls or the snake's body) and allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score and growing in length.  \n\nThe optimal choice is to move UP to eat the apple and avoid collisions.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# SSA S#\n#H S AS#\n#S SSSS#\n#SSSS  #\n#SS   A#\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving UP, and the valid directions (excluding the reverse direction DOWN) are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **LEFT**: The head is at (3,1).

This is safe but does not reach an apple.  \n- **UP**: The head moves to (2,1), which is empty (no wall or self-collision). This is safe and avoids immediate dead ends.  \n\nBetween the valid options (UP and RIGHT), moving UP maintains the current direction and avoids potential future collisions more effectively than RIGHT, which could lead to blocked paths sooner. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# SSSSS#\n#HSSA S#\n#S S AS#\n#S  SSS#\n#SSSS  #\n#SS   A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (row 2, column 1), and the current direction is UP.

Checking row 1, column 1 is a space (' '), which is empty and safe. No collision occurs here.\n- **DOWN (reverse direction)**: Reversing direction (UP → DOWN) is not allowed. Additionally, (row 3, column 1) contains 'S' (snake body), leading to a self-collision if attempted.\n- **LEFT**: Moving left would take the head to (row 2, column 0), which is a wall ('#'), causing an immediate collision.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving right would take the head to (row 2, column 2), which contains 'S' (snake body), leading to a self-collision.\n\nThe only safe and valid direction is to continue moving UP, as other directions result in collisions or are invalid due to reversal rules.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#HSSSSS#\n#SSSA S#\n#S   AS#\n#S  SSS#\n#SSSS  #\n#SS   A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (1,1) (row 1, column 1) with the current direction UP.

Collision with the wall ends the game.  \n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (1,0), which is a wall (column 0 is a wall in row 1). Collision with the wall ends the game.  \n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (1,2), which is occupied by the snake's body (S).

The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#  SSSS#\n#A S SS#\n#  S SS#\n# SS  S#\n#HS A  #\n#SSA   #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 48\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n"],"action":"RIGHT","response":["\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at position (row 4, column 3).\n- Current direction: UP (snake cannot reverse to DOWN).\n- Apples ('A') are at (1,4), (5,2), and (6,5).\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Movement Constraints**: The snake cannot reverse direction. Since the current direction is UP, the next direction can only be UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (DOWN is invalid).\n2. **Apple Proximity**: The closest apple is at (5,2) (Manhattan distance 2 from the head). To reach this apple efficiently:\n   - Moving LEFT in the current step (epoch 1) positions the head at (4,2), allowing a subsequent DOWN move (valid in the next epoch, as direction would then be LEFT, and DOWN is not a reverse of LEFT).\n\n### Evaluation of Directions:\n- **UP**: Moves head to (3,3) (empty, no apple). Slower path to apples.\n- **LEFT**: Moves head to (4,2) (empty, no apple). Enables a subsequent DOWN move to reach the apple at (5,2) in the next epoch.\n- **RIGHT**: Moves head to (4,4) (empty, no apple). Longer path to the closest apple.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT in epoch 1 positions the snake to reach the nearest apple (5,2) in the next epoch.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# H    #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, we analyze the possible moves. The snake is currently moving LEFT and cannot reverse direction (RIGHT is invalid). The valid directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN.\n\n- **LEFT**: The head would move to (row 4, column 1), which is a safe empty space but contains no apple. No score increase.  \n- **UP**: The head would move to (row 3, column 2), which is a safe empty space but contains no apple. No score increase.  \n- **DOWN**: The head would move to (row 5, column 2), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1, grows the snake (old head at (4,2) becomes body 'S'), and avoids collision with walls or itself.  \n\nMoving DOWN is optimal as it safely consumes an apple and advances the game goal. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S    #\n# H   A#\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (row 5, column 2) with a body segment at (row 4, column 2), moving in the DOWN direction. The snake cannot reverse direction (so UP is invalid). The goal is to choose a direction (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN) that avoids collisions and leads toward apples.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving left would take the head to (5, 1), a safe space but no apple. Further left would approach the wall (column 0), which is risky.\n- **DOWN**: Moving down takes the head to (6, 2), a safe space but no apple. Reaching the apple at (6, 5) would require multiple right moves afterward, taking longer.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving right takes the head to (5, 3), a safe space. Subsequent right moves would lead to (5, 4) and then (5, 5), where an apple is located. This path reaches an apple faster than other options.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# SH  A#\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at row 5, column 2, and its body (S) is at row 5, column 1. The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). We need to choose between UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\n### Analysis of possible directions:\n1. **RIGHT**: The head moves from (5,2) to (5,3). This position is empty (no wall or self-collision). Moving right keeps the snake aligned with the apple at (5,5) (same row, 3 steps to the right), making progress toward eating it. This direction is safe and strategic.\n   \n2. **UP**: The head moves from (5,2) to (4,2). This position is empty, but it moves the snake away from the nearest apples (row 5 and row 6 apples) and offers no immediate progress toward eating an apple.\n\n3. **DOWN**: The head moves from (5,2) to (6,2). This position is empty, but the next move down would risk hitting the wall (row 7 is a wall). Additionally, the apple at (6,5) is 3 steps to the right, but this path is less direct than continuing right toward (5,5).\n\n### Conclusion:\nContinuing RIGHT keeps the snake on a direct path toward the nearest apple (row 5, column 5) and avoids unnecessary detours. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SH A#\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (5,3) (row 5, column 3), and the body (S) is at (5,2). The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse to LEFT. The possible directions to choose are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n- **Moving RIGHT**: The new head position would be (5,4), which is empty (no collision with walls or the snake's body). This direction aligns with the current movement and positions the snake to reach the apple at (5,5) in the next move (epoch 6) by continuing RIGHT.  \n- **Moving UP**: The new head position would be (4,3), which is empty but moves the snake away from the nearest apples.  \n- **Moving DOWN**: The new head position would be (6,3), which is empty but requires more steps to reach the nearest apples compared to moving RIGHT.  \n\nThe closest apple is at (5,5), two steps to the right of the current head. Moving RIGHT now sets up the snake to reach this apple in the next epoch. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SHA#\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (row 5, column 5), with its body ('S') at (row 5, column 4). The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). \n\nAnalyzing possible moves:\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (5,5) leads to (5,6), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple will increase the score, grow the snake's length, and avoid collisions (since (5,6) is not a wall or the snake's body).\n- **UP**: Moving UP from (5,5) leads to (4,5), an empty space. This avoids collision but does not eat an apple, so no score increase.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (5,5) leads to (6,5), which also contains an apple ('A'). However, after moving DOWN, the next potential move (e.g., UP) could collide with the snake's new body (which would occupy (5,5) after growth). \n\nChoosing RIGHT is optimal because it directly leads to eating an apple, increases the score, and avoids immediate collision risks. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SSH#\n#     A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, analyze the current state:\n\n- **Snake Position**: Head (H) is at (row 5, column 5). Body segments (S) are at (row 5, column 4) and (row 5, column 3).\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid).\n- **Possible Directions**: UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT (but RIGHT leads to a wall at (row 5, column 6), causing collision → game over).\n\n### Analysis of Valid Directions:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (row 4, column 5), which is empty (safe but no apple).\n2. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (row 6, column 5), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score by 1, grows the snake, and avoids collision (no self-collision or wall collision).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN allows the snake to eat an apple, grow, and avoid immediate danger.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#   SSS#\n#     H#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (6,5) (row 6, column 5) and is currently moving DOWN. The next move must avoid walls, self-collision, and cannot reverse direction (UP is invalid as it reverses DOWN). \n\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (7,5), which is a wall (row 7 is all '#'). Collision with walls ends the game.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (6,6), which is a wall (column 6 in row 6 is '#'). Collision with walls ends the game.  \n- **UP**: Reversing direction from DOWN to UP is not allowed.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (6,4), which is empty (no walls or snake body). This is safe.  \n\nThe only valid and safe direction is LEFT.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#    SS#\n#    HS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (6,5) (row 6, column 5). The current direction is LEFT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). The possible directions to consider are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. \n\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (7,5), which is a wall (row 7 is entirely walls). This causes a collision, ending the game.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (5,5). Checking row 5, column 5 is occupied by a body segment ('S'), leading to a self-collision. This also ends the game.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (6,4), which is an empty space (no wall or body). This is safe.  \n\nThus, the only safe direction is LEFT. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#     S#\n#   HSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (6,3) (row 6, column 3), moving in the current direction LEFT. The snake's body segments are at (6,4), (6,5), and (5,5). The apples are located at (1,3), (1,4), and (4,2). \n\nThe snake cannot reverse direction (RIGHT is invalid). Possible directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. However, moving DOWN would lead the head to (7,3), which is a wall (row 7 is a wall), causing a collision. Thus, DOWN is invalid. \n\n### Analysis of valid directions:\n1. **LEFT**: The head would move to (6,2). This position is empty (no wall or body collision). The new snake body would be (6,2) [H], (6,3) [S], (6,4) [S], (6,5) [S] (tail at (5,5) is removed as no apple is eaten). This is safe.\n2. **UP**: The head would move to (5,3). This position is empty (no wall or body collision). The new snake body would be (5,3) [H], (6,3) [S], (6,4) [S], (6,5) [S] (tail at (5,5) is removed). This is also safe.\n\n### Choosing the optimal direction:\nBoth LEFT and UP are safe. However, moving UP positions the snake closer to the upper apples (e.g., (1,3) and (1,4)) and the apple at (4,2) (row 4, column 2). Moving UP allows the snake to progress toward these apples in subsequent steps without blocking its path. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#   H  #\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (row 5, column 3) with a current direction of UP. The snake's body segments are at (row 6, column 3), (row 6, column 4), and (row 6, column 5). The goal is to move the snake toward apples ('A') while avoiding collisions with walls or its own body.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Moves:\n1. **UP**: If the snake continues moving UP, the head will move to (row 4, column 3), which is empty (no apple or collision). This is safe but does not reach an apple immediately.\n2. **LEFT**: If the snake turns LEFT (allowed, as LEFT is not the reverse of UP), the head will move to (row 5, column 2), which is empty (no collision). From (row 5, column 2), the next move UP can reach the apple at (row 4, column 2) in the following epoch. This path positions the snake to eat an apple soon.\n3. **RIGHT**: If the snake turns RIGHT, the head will move to (row 5, column 4), which is empty but does not lead toward any apples in the immediate next steps.\n4. **DOWN**: Reversing direction (DOWN) is invalid, as the snake cannot reverse its current direction (UP → DOWN is forbidden).\n\n### Optimal Choice:\nMoving LEFT allows the snake to position itself to reach the apple at (row 4, column 2) in the next epoch, making it the best choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#  HS  #\n#   SS #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, analyze the current game state:\n\n### Game Board Analysis\n- **Walls**: Surround the board (row 0 and 7, column 0 and 7).\n- **Snake Position**: Head `H` at (5,2); body `S` at (5,3), (6,3), (6,4).\n- **Apples**: At (1,3), (1,4), (4,3).\n- **Current Direction**: LEFT (snake cannot reverse to RIGHT).\n\n### Possible Moves\n1. **LEFT**: Head moves to (5,1). This is safe (no wall\/body collision) but leads to empty space (no apple).\n2. **UP**: Head moves to (4,2). Safe (no wall\/body collision). From (4,2), the next move can be RIGHT to reach the apple at (4,3), a direct path to an apple.\n3. **DOWN**: Head moves to (6,2). Safe but leads to empty space, with no immediate apple nearby.\n\n### Optimal Choice\nMoving **UP** positions the snake to reach the apple at (4,3) in the next move (by turning RIGHT afterward), maximizing apple consumption.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  HA  #\n#  SS  #\n#   SS #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4, 3) (row 4, column 3). The current direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse to DOWN. Possible directions to choose are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **Moving UP**: The head would move to (3, 3), which is empty (no apple). No collision, but no score increase.  \n- **Moving LEFT**: The head would move to (4, 2), which is empty (no apple). No collision, but no score increase.  \n- **Moving RIGHT**: The head would move to (4, 4), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1, and the snake grows in length (no tail removal). The new head position (4, 4) is safe (no wall or self-collision).  \n\nMoving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple, which is optimal. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#  SH  #\n#  SS  #\n#   SS #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's position, current direction (RIGHT), and potential moves. The snake's head (H) is at (4,3), with body segments (S) at (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), and (6,4). The snake cannot reverse direction (LEFT is invalid here). We evaluate valid directions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT):\n\n1. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (4,3) leads to (5,3), which is occupied by the snake's body (S). This causes a collision, ending the game. **Invalid**.\n\n2. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (4,3) leads to (4,4), an empty space. This is safe but does not reach an apple immediately. Future moves right would eventually hit a wall (column 6 in row 4 is a wall), limiting long-term progress.\n\n3. **UP**: Moving UP from (4,3) leads to (3,3), an empty space. This is safe. From (3,3), the snake can then move LEFT toward the apple at (3,1) in subsequent steps. This path allows the snake to reach an apple in 2-3 moves, maximizing score growth.\n\nThus, the best direction is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#A  H  #\n#  SS  #\n#  SS  #\n#   S  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current position, available apples, and movement constraints. \n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The snake's head ('H') is at (row 3, column 4). The body ('S') occupies positions (4,2), (4,3), (5,2), (5,3), and (6,3). The current direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid).\n- **Apples**: Apples ('A') are at (1,3), (1,4), and (3,1).\n- **Goal**: Move the snake to eat an apple safely.\n\n### Direction Analysis:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP would shift the head to (2,4). This position is empty (no wall or self-collision). From (2,4), the next move (if continuing UP) would reach (1,4), which is an apple. This path allows eating an apple in the next epoch (epoch 16).\n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT shifts the head to (3,3). This position is safe but does not contain an apple. From (3,3), reaching the apple at (1,3) would take two additional moves (UP twice), which is slower than the UP path.\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT shifts the head to (3,5). This position is safe but does not contain an apple. From (3,5), there are no nearby apples, making this path less optimal.\n4. **DOWN**: Invalid (reverse direction).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP is optimal, as it positions the snake to eat the apple at (1,4) in the next epoch.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   AA #\n#   H  #\n#A  S  #\n#  SS  #\n#  SS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (2,3) (row 2, column 3) and is currently moving UP. The snake cannot reverse direction, so the possible next directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (DOWN is invalid as it is the reverse of UP). \n\n### Analysis of possible moves:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (1,3). This position is empty (no walls or body segments) and safe. However, (1,3) is not an apple, so the snake would not gain length here.\n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (2,2). This position is empty and safe but also not an apple.\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (2,4). This position is empty and safe. From (2,4), the next move UP would reach (1,4), which is an apple, allowing the snake to eat it and grow.\n\n### Best choice:\nMoving RIGHT positions the snake to reach an apple in the next move (by moving UP to (1,4)), which is optimal for increasing the score.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#   AA #\n#   SH #\n#A  S  #\n#  SS  #\n#  S   #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n- **Snake Head Position**: (Row 2, Column 5) (marked 'H').\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT.

This cell is empty (no apple) and safe (no wall or self-collision). No score gain.\n2. **DOWN**: The head would move to (Row 3, Column 5). This cell is empty (no apple) and safe. No score gain.\n3. **UP**: The head would move to (Row 1, Column 5), which contains an apple ('A'). This cell is safe (no wall or self-collision). Eating the apple increases the score by 1 and grows the snake.\n\nMoving UP allows the snake to eat an apple, which is the most beneficial action. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   AH #\n#   SS #\n#A  S  #\n# ASS  #\n#  S   #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is located at position (row 1, column 5).

The possible directions to choose are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (row 0, column 5), which is a wall (#). This would cause a collision and end the game. Thus, UP is invalid.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (row 1, column 4), which contains an apple (A). This position is not part of the snake's body (S), so it is safe. Eating the apple will increase the score and allow the snake to grow.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (row 1, column 6), which is a free space (no wall or body collision). However, there is no apple here, so it does not provide immediate benefit.  \n\nThe best choice is to move LEFT to eat the apple safely. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   HS #\n#   SS #\n#A  S  #\n# ASS A#\n#  S   #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the next direction, we analyze the snake's current state:\n- **Head position**: (row 1, column 4) (marked 'H').\n- **Current direction**: LEFT (snake is moving left).\n- **Collision rules**: The snake cannot collide with walls (marked '#') or its own body (marked 'S').\n- **Possible directions**: Since the current direction is LEFT, the snake cannot reverse to RIGHT. Valid options are UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\n### Analysis of each possible direction:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP from (1, 4) would take the head to (0, 4). Row 0 is a wall (all '#'), so this causes a wall collision. Game over. ❌\n2. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (1, 4) would take the head to (2, 4). Row 2, column 4 is 'S' (part of the snake's body), so this causes a self-collision. Game over. ❌\n3. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (1, 4) takes the head to (1, 3). Row 1, column 3 is empty (' '), with no walls or body segments. This is safe. ✅\n\nThus, the only valid direction to avoid immediate collision is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  HSS #\n#   SS #\n#A  S  #\n# ASS A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. The snake’s head ('H') is at (row 1, column 2), moving LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid), and collisions with walls or its body end the game. Apples ('A') are at (3,1), (4,1), and (4,5).\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Current Direction (LEFT):** Moving LEFT would take the head to (1,1). This position is empty (no wall or body), so it is safe. From (1,1), the next valid move is DOWN (since UP and LEFT lead to walls). Moving DOWN from (1,1) to (2,1) (safe), then DOWN again to (3,1) (apple) allows the snake to eat an apple in 2 steps.\n\n2. **Direction DOWN:** Moving DOWN would take the head to (2,2). This position is empty (no wall or body), so it is safe. From (2,2), moving DOWN to (3,2) (safe), then LEFT to (3,1) (apple) also allows the snake to eat an apple in 2 steps.\n\n3. **Invalid Directions:** UP leads to a wall (row 0), and RIGHT is a reverse of the current direction (LEFT), so both are invalid.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth LEFT and DOWN are safe and lead to the nearest apple (3,1) in 2 steps. Since the snake is already moving LEFT and this path is safe, continuing in the current direction (LEFT) is a logical choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n# HSSS #\n#   SS #\n#A  S  #\n# A S A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe current direction is LEFT, and the snake's head is at (1,1). Moving LEFT would take the head to (1,0), which is a wall (game over). Reversing direction to RIGHT is not allowed. Moving UP would take the head to (0,1), which is also a wall (game over). The only valid direction is DOWN, which moves the head to (2,1), an empty space. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# SSSS #\n# H SS #\n#A  S  #\n# A   A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN.

Checking (3,1) on the board, it is an apple ('A'). \n\nMoving DOWN is valid because:\n- The snake cannot reverse direction (current direction is DOWN, so reversing to UP is invalid, but DOWN itself is allowed).\n- The new head position (3,1) is within the board (no wall collision).\n- (3,1) is an apple, not a body segment (no self-collision).\n\nEating the apple will increase the score by 1 and grow the snake.

The snake's head ('H') is at position (4,3) (row 4, column 3), and the current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). We evaluate the three valid directions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) for safety and apple proximity:\n\n### 1. RIGHT (Current Direction)\n- Next head position: (4,4).  \n- Check collision: (4,4) is empty (no wall or snake body).  \n- Path to apples: Continuing RIGHT leads to (4,5) (empty) and then (4,6) (apple). This apple is in the same row as the head, making it a direct and safe path.\n\n### 2. UP\n- Next head position: (3,3).  \n- Check collision: (3,3) is empty.  \n- Path to apples: Moving UP could lead to (2,3) → (2,4) → (2,5) (apple), but this path is less direct than RIGHT.\n\n### 3. DOWN\n- Next head position: (5,3).  \n- Check collision: (5,3) is empty.  \n- Path to apples: Moving DOWN could lead to (5,4) → (5,5) → (5,6) (apple), but this path is also less direct than RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT is the optimal choice as it maintains the current safe direction, avoids collisions, and provides the most direct path to an apple at (4,6).\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# SSS  #\n# S   A#\n#SS    #\n#SSSH A#\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. The snake's head is at (4,4) (row 4, column 4) and is moving RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid), leaving UP, DOWN, or RIGHT as options.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (2,5), (4,6), and (5,5).\n2. **Snake's Body**: The snake's body consists of S's at (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). No body segments are in (4,5), (3,4), or (5,4) (the next positions for RIGHT, UP, or DOWN, respectively).\n3. **Collision Check**:\n   - **RIGHT**: Next head position is (4,5) (empty, no collision). This move is safe.\n   - **UP**: Next head position is (3,4) (empty, no collision). This move is safe.\n   - **DOWN**: Next head position is (5,4) (empty, no collision). This move is safe.\n\n### Optimal Path:\nMoving RIGHT allows the snake to reach (4,5) in the current epoch. In the next epoch (epoch 29), continuing RIGHT would move the head to (4,6), which contains an apple. This directly leads to eating an apple, increasing the score, and growing the snake.

This is safe (no wall or self-collision) and would increase the score. However, the next move in the same direction (RIGHT) would reach (4,7), which is a wall (game-ending collision).  \n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (3,5), an empty space. This is safe but does not eat an apple, so no score increase.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (5,5), which contains an apple ('A'). This is safe (no wall or self-collision) and increases the score. Additionally, the next move in the same direction (DOWN) would reach (6,5), an empty space (safe for future movement).  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN allows the snake to eat an apple, avoid immediate collision risks, and provides more safe space for future moves compared to RIGHT (which risks a wall collision next turn). \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# S    #\n# S   A#\n#SS    #\n#SSSSSA#\n#    HA#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is currently at position (5, 4) (row 5, column 4) and moving in the DOWN direction.

Eating the apple will grow the snake and increase the score.  \n- **Moving LEFT**: The next head position is (row 5, column 1), which is empty but contains no apple.  \n- **Moving RIGHT**: The next head position is (row 5, column 3), which is empty but contains no apple.  \n\nMoving DOWN is safe, allows the snake to eat an apple, and maximizes the score. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#  SSSS#\n#  S SS#\n#  S SS#\n# SS  S#\n# S A S#\n#AHA   #\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (6, 2) (row 6, column 2). The current direction is DOWN, so the snake cannot reverse to UP. The possible directions to choose are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. \n\n- **DOWN**: Moving down from (6, 2) would take the head to (7, 2), which is a wall (row 7 is entirely walls). This would cause a collision, ending the game. Thus, DOWN is invalid.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving left from (6, 2) would take the head to (6, 1), which is an apple ('A'). This square is not part of the snake's body (no 'S' here). Eating the apple is safe, increases the score, and allows the snake to grow. After moving left, the new head is at (6, 1), and the previous head position (6, 2) becomes part of the body.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving right from (6, 2) would take the head to (6, 3), which is also an apple ('A'). This square is not part of the snake's body. However, the area to the right (column 3) has more body segments in higher rows (e.g., row 4, column 3 is 'S'), which could restrict future movement.  \n\nChoosing LEFT leads the snake into a more open area (column 1 is mostly empty in rows 1-6), reducing the risk of future collisions with the body. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#  SSSS#\n#A S SS#\n#  S SS#\n# SS  S#\n# S A S#\n#HSA   #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 6, column 1).\n2. **Current Direction**: LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid).\n3. **Possible Directions**: UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since RIGHT is reversed and invalid).\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (6, 0), which is a wall ('#'). Collision with the wall ends the game. **Invalid**.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (7, 1), which is a wall ('#'). Collision with the wall ends the game. **Invalid**.\n- **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (5, 1). Checking row 5, column 1: the cell is empty (' '), with no snake body ('S') or wall ('#'). This is a safe move. **Valid**.\n\nThus, the only safe direction is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#  SSSS#\n#A S SS#\n#  S SS#\n# SS  S#\n#HS A  #\n#SSA   #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (5, 1) (row 5, column 1). The current direction is UP. We need to evaluate possible directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) while considering collision rules:\n\n1. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (4, 1). Checking row 4 (\"# SS  S#\"), column 1 is 'S' (snake body). Collision with self → game ends.  \n2. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (6, 1). Checking row 6 (\"#SSA   #\"), column 1 is 'S' (snake body). Collision with self → game ends.  \n3. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (5, 0). Column 0 is '#' (wall). Collision with wall → game ends.  \n4. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (5, 2). Checking row 5 (\"#HS A  #\"), column 2 is 'S' (snake body). Collision with self → game ends.  \n\nAll possible directions result in a collision (either with the snake’s body or walls), so the game will end regardless of the chosen direction. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point. The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n#S     #\n#S   A #\n#S     #\n#H  A  #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 8\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#  SSSS#\n#  SSSS#\n#A  ASS#\n#    SS#\n#   ASS#\n#  SSSH#\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 52\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n"],"action":"LEFT","response":["\n\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n# A    #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at (row 4, column 2).\n- Current direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse to DOWN.\n- Possible directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since DOWN is a reversal of UP).\n- Moving UP (current direction) takes the head to (row 3, column 2), which contains an apple ('A').

This cell is empty (no apple, no collision). The snake moves but gains no score.\n2. **LEFT**: The next head position is (row 3, column 2), which contains an apple 'A'. Eating this apple increases the score by 1, and the snake grows (previous head position (3,3) becomes body 'S'). No collision with walls or itself.\n3. **RIGHT**: The next head position is (row 3, column 4). This cell is empty (no apple, no collision). The snake moves but gains no score.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, increasing the score. This is the best choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n# HS   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (3, 2) (row 3, column 2), with a body segment (S) at (3, 4). The current direction is LEFT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). The goal is to move toward apples ('A') while avoiding walls and self-collision.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (2, 1), (6, 1), and (6, 4). The closest apple is at (2, 1) (row 2, column 1), which is 1 row up and 1 column left of the head.\n2. **Valid Directions**: Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (RIGHT is invalid as it reverses direction).\n3. **Safety Checks**:\n   - **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (3, 1). This is safe (no wall\/body collision), but (3, 1) is empty. However, continuing LEFT afterward could risk hitting the wall (column 0) in subsequent moves.\n   - **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (4, 2), which is safe but moves away from the closest apple.\n   - **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (2, 2), which is safe (no wall\/body collision). From (2, 2), the next move LEFT would reach the apple at (2, 1), allowing the snake to eat it in the next epoch. This path avoids near-term wall collision risk (column 2 is further from the left wall than column 1).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP positions the snake closer to the nearest apple (2, 1) while maintaining a safer distance from the left wall. This direction optimizes apple collection and avoids immediate collision risks.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#AH    #\n# S    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and collision risks:\n\n### Current State:\n- **Snake Head (H):** Position (row 2, column 2).\n- **Snake Body (S):** Position (row 3, column 2) (length 2).\n- **Current Direction:** UP (cannot reverse to DOWN).\n- **Apples (A):** Positions (row 2, column 1), (row 6, column 1), (row 6, column 4).\n\n### Possible Directions:\nThe snake can only move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (DOWN is invalid due to direction reversal).\n\n1. **UP:**  \n   Next head position: (row 1, column 2). This cell is empty (no apple, no collision). The snake does not grow, and the score remains unchanged.  \n\n2. **LEFT:**  \n   Next head position: (row 2, column 1). This cell contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score by 1, the snake grows (length becomes 3), and no collision occurs (new head is not a wall or body).  \n\n3. **RIGHT:**  \n   Next head position: (row 2, column 3). This cell is empty (no apple, no collision). The snake does not grow, and the score remains unchanged.  \n\n### Optimal Choice:\nMoving LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple, grow in length, and safely avoid collisions. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#HS    #\n# S    #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, first analyze the current state:\n\n1. **Snake Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 2, column 1). The body 'S' segments are at (row 2, column 2) and (row 3, column 2). The snake’s length is 3.\n2. **Current Direction**: LEFT. The snake cannot reverse to RIGHT.\n3. **Collision Risks**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (row 2, column 0), which is a wall (game-ending collision). Thus, LEFT is invalid.\n4. **Possible Directions**: UP or DOWN (non-reversing directions).\n\n### Analysis of UP:\n- Moving UP would take the head to (row 1, column 1). This position is empty (no collision with walls or body). However, (row 1, column 1) is not an apple. Further, moving UP again from (row 1, column 1) would lead to (row 0, column 1), a wall (collision). This path risks future wall collisions and does not lead toward apples.\n\n### Analysis of DOWN:\n- Moving DOWN takes the head to (row 3, column 1). This position is empty (no collision). The next steps can continue moving DOWN:\n  - Epoch 6: DOWN to (row 4, column 1) (safe, no collision).\n  - Epoch 7: DOWN to (row 5, column 1) (safe, no collision).\n  - Epoch 8: DOWN to (row 6, column 1) (contains an apple 'A'). Eating this apple grows the snake and increases the score.\n\nThis path safely leads the snake toward the nearest apple at (row 6, column 1) without collision risks.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#SS    #\n#H     #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current state:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at row 3, column 1.\n- The current direction is DOWN, so the snake cannot reverse to UP. Valid directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n- **LEFT**: Moving left from (3,1) leads to column 0, which is a wall ('#'). This causes a collision, so LEFT is invalid.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving right from (3,1) leads to (3,2), which is empty. This is safe but does not immediately target an apple.\n- **DOWN**: Moving down from (3,1) leads to (4,1), which is empty. This is safe and positions the snake closer to the apple at (4,4) (row 4, column 4), which can be reached by subsequent right moves.\n\nContinuing DOWN keeps the snake on a path toward the nearest apple (row 4, column 4) without risk of collision. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#H   A #\n#      #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (4,1) (row 4, column 1), with body segments at (3,1) and (2,1). The current direction is DOWN, and the snake cannot reverse to UP. Possible directions to choose are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT (since UP is the reverse and invalid). \n\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (4,1) would take the head to (4,0), which is a wall. This causes a collision, ending the game. Invalid.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (4,1) would take the head to (4,2), an empty square. This is safe but does not lead directly to an apple.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (4,1) takes the head to (5,1), an empty square (safe). In the next epoch, continuing DOWN would move the head to (6,1), which contains an apple. This path allows the snake to eat an apple in the next step, growing in length and increasing the score.  \n\nChoosing DOWN is the optimal move, as it avoids collisions and leads to an apple in the next epoch. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#S     #\n#S   A #\n#H     #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (5,1) (row 5, column 1), with body segments at (4,1) and (3,1). The current direction is DOWN, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so UP is invalid). \n\nPossible moves:\n- **LEFT**: Would move the head to (5,0), which is a wall (column 0 is a '#'), causing a collision. Invalid.\n- **RIGHT**: Would move the head to (5,2), an empty space. Safe but no apple.\n- **DOWN**: Would move the head to (6,1), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple is safe (no collision with walls or self), increases the score, and grows the snake.\n- **UP**: Reverses the current direction (DOWN → UP), which is not allowed. Invalid.\n\nThe optimal move is to continue moving DOWN to eat the apple. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n#S     #\n#S   A #\n#S     #\n#H  A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (6, 1) (row 6, column 1), with its body segments trailing upward along column 1: (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1). The current direction is DOWN, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so UP is invalid). \n\nAnalyzing possible moves:\n- **DOWN**: The head would move to (7, 1), which is a wall (row 7 is all '#'), causing a collision. Invalid.\n- **UP**: Reverse of the current direction (DOWN), which is not allowed. Invalid.\n- **LEFT**: The head would move to (6, 0), which is a wall (column 0 is '#'), causing a collision. Invalid.\n- **RIGHT**: The head moves to (6, 2), which is empty (row 6, column 2 is ' '). This is safe, as there is no collision with walls or the snake's body. The snake will move here without eating an apple, so the tail (3, 1) will be removed, and the previous head (6, 1) becomes a body segment. This is the only valid move.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#S   A #\n#S     #\n#SH A  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (6, 2) (row 6, column 2). The snake's body ('S') segments are at (4, 1), (5, 1), and (6, 1). The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). \n\nPossible next directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (7, 2), which is a wall (row 7 is all '#'), causing a collision. This is invalid.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (5, 2). This cell is empty (no wall or body), so it is safe but does not lead to an apple immediately.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (6, 3). This cell is empty (no wall or body), so it is safe. Additionally, moving RIGHT again in the next epoch would reach (6, 4), which contains an apple ('A'), allowing the snake to eat it and grow.  \n\nChoosing RIGHT is optimal as it positions the snake to reach an apple in the next move. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#S     #\n#SSHA  #\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, we analyze the current state:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at row 6, column 3.\n- Current direction is RIGHT, so the next move in the current direction would be to row 6, column 4.\n- Row 6, column 4 contains an apple ('A'), so moving RIGHT will allow the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score and growing the snake.\n- Checking for collisions: The next position (row 6, column 4) is not a wall (within the 8x8 grid bounds) and not part of the snake's body (snake body is at row 6, columns 1-2; row 5, column 1). Thus, moving RIGHT is safe.\n- Other directions: \n  - DOWN would move the head to row 7, column 3, which is a wall (row 7 is all '#'), causing a collision.\n  - LEFT is the reverse of the current direction (RIGHT → LEFT), which is not allowed.\n  - UP would move the head to row 5, column 3, which is empty but contains no apple, so no score gain.\n\nThe optimal choice is to continue moving RIGHT to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#S     #\n#SSSHA #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (6,4) (row 6, column 4). The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). Let's analyze the possible moves:\n\n1. **RIGHT**: The head would move to (6,5). Checking this position: row 6, column 5 is 'A' (an apple). Moving RIGHT would allow the snake to eat the apple, increase the score by 1, and grow in length. The new head position (6,5) is within the board (not a wall) and does not collide with the snake's body (current body segments are at (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)). This is a safe and beneficial move.\n\n2. **UP**: The head would move to (5,4). This position is empty (no apple, no wall, no body collision), but it does not result in eating an apple, which is less optimal than moving RIGHT.\n\n3. **DOWN**: The head would move to (7,4), which is a wall (row 7 is all '#'). This would cause a collision and end the game, so DOWN is invalid.\n\nMoving RIGHT directly leads to eating an apple, which is the best choice. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n#S     #\n#SSSSH #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The snake's head ('H') is at (row 6, column 5). The body ('S') occupies (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4).\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid).\n- **Apples**: Located at (2,1), (4,3), (4,4).\n- **Walls**: The board is bordered by '#' (rows 0 and 7, columns 0 and 7).\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (6,6) (empty space, safe). No apple here, but avoids collision.\n2. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (5,5) (empty space, safe). No apple here, but positions the snake to approach apples in row 4.\n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (7,5), which is a wall (collision, invalid).\n4. **LEFT**: Reverse of RIGHT (invalid per rules).\n\n### Strategy:\nThe goal is to reach apples safely. The apples at (4,3) and (4,4) are in row 4, left of the snake's current position (column 5). Moving UP allows the snake to pivot toward these apples (e.g., UP → LEFT → UP to reach (4,3)). Continuing RIGHT would eventually require turning UP but delays access to the apples. Thus, UP is the better choice to position the snake for future apple collection.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n#    H #\n#SSSSS #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving UP. The head (H) is at row 5, column 4. The body (S) occupies row 6, columns 1-5. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid), leaving UP, LEFT, or RIGHT as possible moves. \n\n### Analysis of possible moves:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to row 4, column 4 (a safe, empty cell). This positions the head in row 4, where two apples (A) are located (row 4, columns 3 and 5). From row 4, column 4, the snake can then move LEFT to reach the apple at (4,3) or RIGHT to reach the apple at (4,5) in the next step. This path is safe and leads directly toward nearby apples.\n\n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to row 5, column 3 (a safe, empty cell). From here, the snake could move UP to reach the apple at (4,3) in the next step. However, this delays reaching row 4 (where apples are) by one step compared to moving UP first.\n\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to row 5, column 5 (a safe, empty cell). From here, the snake could move UP to reach the apple at (4,5) in the next step. Like LEFT, this also delays reaching row 4 compared to moving UP immediately.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP is optimal because it positions the head in row 4 (where apples are) in the current step, allowing the snake to reach either apple in the next move. This minimizes the number of steps needed to eat an apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#  A H #\n#A   S #\n#SSSSS #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The snake's head ('H') is at row 4, column 5.

Possible directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n- **Apples**: Located at (2,1), (4,3), (5,1).\n\n### Direction Analysis:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (3,5) (empty space). No apple here, and no collision risk, but does not lead toward nearby apples.\n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (4,4) (empty space). This position is safe (no body or wall collision). From (4,4), the next move LEFT would reach (4,3), which contains an apple. This sets up a path to eat an apple in the next epoch.\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (4,6) (empty space). No apple here, and this direction moves away from the nearest apple at (4,3).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT is optimal as it positions the snake to reach the apple at (4,3) in the next move, maximizing score potential.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#  AHS #\n#A   S #\n# SSSS #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4,4) (row 4, column 4), and it is currently moving LEFT.

Eating the apple increases the score and grows the snake without collision (no walls or body segments at (4,3)).\n- Moving UP or DOWN would lead to empty spaces with no apples, resulting in no score increase.\n\nThus, the optimal direction is to continue moving LEFT to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n# A    #\n#  HSS #\n#A   S #\n# SSSS #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Current State:\n- **Snake Head (H) Position**: (Row 4, Column 2)\n- **Current Direction**: LEFT (snake is moving left)\n- **Apples (A) Positions**: (Row 2, Column 1), (Row 3, Column 2), (Row 5, Column 1)\n- **Snake Body (S) Positions**: (4,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n- **Constraints**: The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., LEFT → RIGHT is invalid).\n\n### Possible Directions:\nThe snake can move in **UP**, **DOWN**, or **LEFT** (since RIGHT is a reversal of LEFT and is invalid).\n\n#### 1. LEFT (Current Direction):\n- New head position: (4, 1) (moving left from (4,2)).\n- (4,1) is empty (no apple, no body, no wall). The snake moves safely but does not eat an apple.\n\n#### 2. UP:\n- New head position: (3, 2) (moving up from (4,2)).\n- (3,2) contains an apple ('A').

No apple here, but moving LEFT allows the snake to position itself to reach the apple at (2,1) in the next move (by turning UP).  \n\n2. **UP**:  \n   - Next head position: (2, 2) (row decreases by 1).  \n   - Check collision: (2,2) is empty (no wall or body segment).  \n   - Safety: Safe.

This causes a collision. Invalid.\n- **RIGHT**: The head would move to (2,2). Checking the board, (2,2) is empty (no wall or body). Safe, but no apple here.\n- **UP**: The head would move to (1,1). Checking the board, (1,1) is empty (no wall or body). Safe, and no apple here.\n\nBetween the valid options (UP and RIGHT), moving UP avoids potential future collisions. The snake’s body is in rows 3-6, and moving UP to (1,1) keeps the head in an empty area with more maneuvering space. Turning RIGHT could lead to body collisions in subsequent steps (e.g., moving DOWN from (2,2) would hit the body at (3,2)). Thus, continuing UP is the safer choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#H     #\n#S     #\n#SSS   #\n# ASSS #\n#AA  S #\n#    S #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (1,1) (row 1, column 1). The current direction is UP, so the snake cannot reverse to DOWN. The possible directions to consider are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP from (1,1) would take the head to (0,1), which is a wall (row 0 is all '#'). This would cause a collision with the wall, ending the game.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (1,1) would take the head to (1,0), which is a wall (column 0 of row 1 is '#'). This would also cause a wall collision.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (1,1) would take the head to (1,2). Checking the board, (1,2) is an empty space (no wall or snake body). This direction is safe.  \n\nThus, the only safe direction is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#SH    #\n#S     #\n#SSS   #\n# ASSS #\n#AA  S #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (1, 3) (row 1, column 3), and it is currently moving RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (0, 3), which is a wall ('#'). This causes a collision, ending the game. **Invalid**.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (2, 3), which is empty (no wall or snake body). This is safe but does not eat an apple.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (1, 4), which is empty (no wall or snake body). This is safe but does not eat an apple.\n\nBetween the valid options (DOWN and RIGHT), both are safe. However, moving RIGHT maintains the current direction and avoids potential collisions with the snake’s body in the near term. The snake’s body is clustered in the lower-left area, and moving RIGHT keeps the head in open space, allowing more flexibility for future moves toward apples located in rows 4 and 5.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#SSH   #\n#S     #\n#SSS   #\n# ASSS #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is located at position (row 1, column 4) (0-indexed). The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). The goal is to choose a safe direction (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) that avoids walls and self-collision.\n\n### Analysis of possible directions:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP from (1,4) would take the head to (0,4), which is a wall (row 0 is all '#'). This causes an immediate collision. **Invalid**.\n2. **LEFT**: Reversing direction from RIGHT to LEFT is not allowed. **Invalid**.\n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (1,4) takes the head to (2,4). Checking (2,4) on the board (row 2: \"#S     #\"), this position is empty (no wall or snake body). **Safe**.\n4. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (1,4) takes the head to (1,5). Checking (1,5) on the board (row 1: \"#SSH   #\"), this position is empty (no wall or snake body). **Safe**.\n\n### Choosing the best direction:\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT are safe. However, the snake currently moves in the RIGHT direction, and continuing in this direction maintains a consistent path without unnecessary turns. Since neither direction leads to an immediate apple, the safest and most straightforward choice is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SSSH  #\n#S     #\n#SSS   #\n# ASS  #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and collision risks:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: Head (H) is at (1, 4) (row 1, column 4). The body (S) occupies (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4).\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (LEFT is invalid).\n- **Apples**: Located at (4,2), (5,1), (5,2).\n- **Walls**: Surround the board (row 0 and row 7 are all `#`).\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP from (1,4) leads to (0,4), which is a wall (row 0 is `########`). Collision risk. **Invalid**.\n2. **LEFT**: Reverse of current direction (RIGHT). **Invalid**.\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (1,4) leads to (1,5). This square is empty (row 1: `#SSSH  #`), no collision. Safe but moves away from apples.\n4. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (1,4) leads to (2,4). This square is empty (row 2: `#S     #`), no collision. Safe and moves toward apples in lower rows (4,5).\n\n### Strategy:\nThe snake’s goal is to eat apples. Moving DOWN positions the snake to eventually reach apples at (4,2), (5,1), or (5,2) in future steps. Moving RIGHT avoids immediate collision but delays access to apples. Thus, DOWN is optimal.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#SSSS  #\n#S  H  #\n#SSS   #\n# AS   #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN. The snake's head is at (row 2, column 4). The snake cannot reverse direction, so the possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. \n\n### Analysis of possible directions:\n1. **DOWN**: The head moves to (row 3, column 4), which is a space (safe, no collision with walls or body). This direction leads the snake downward, closer to the apples located in rows 4 and 5 (positions (4,2), (5,1), (5,2)). After moving down, the tail (previously at (4,4)) is removed, freeing up (4,4) for future movement. This path allows the snake to approach the apples in subsequent moves.\n   \n2. **LEFT**: The head moves to (row 2, column 3), which is a space (safe initially). However, subsequent moves from (2,3) would risk collisions with the snake’s body (e.g., moving DOWN to (3,3) or UP to (1,3) both hit body segments). This direction leads to dead ends.\n\n3. **RIGHT**: The head moves to (row 2, column 5), which is a space (safe initially). However, moving RIGHT further would quickly hit the wall (column 7), and moving DOWN from (2,5) leads away from the apples. This direction is not optimal for reaching apples.\n\n### Conclusion:\nContinuing in the current direction (DOWN) is the safest and most strategic choice, as it positions the snake to approach the apples in subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SSSS  #\n#S  S  #\n#SSSH  #\n# A    #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and collision risks:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The head ('H') is at (row 3, column 4). The body ('S') occupies positions in rows 1-3, with the tail likely at (row 1, column 4) (the oldest segment).\n- **Current Direction**: DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction (UP is invalid).\n- **Apples**: Located at (row 4, column 2), (row 5, column 2), and (row 5, column 3).\n- **Possible Moves**: LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (UP is reversed and invalid).\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (row 3, column 3), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This causes a self-collision, ending the game. **Invalid**.\n   \n2. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (row 3, column 5), a safe empty space. However, this direction does not lead toward the apples (which are in rows 4-5, columns 2-3) and may limit future movement options (e.g., further RIGHT would hit the wall at column 7). **Suboptimal**.\n\n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (row 4, column 4), a safe empty space. This direction positions the snake closer to the apples in row 4 and row 5. From (row 4, column 4), the snake can later turn LEFT to reach the apple at (row 4, column 2) in subsequent moves. **Safe and strategic**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN avoids collisions, positions the snake to reach apples in future steps, and is the only valid and optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SSSS  #\n#S  S  #\n#SS S  #\n# A H  #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's position, current direction (DOWN), and apple locations. The snake's head ('H') is at (row 4, column 4). Apples ('A') are at (4,2), (5,1), and (5,2). The snake cannot reverse direction (so UP is invalid), leaving LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN as options.\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (5,4), which is empty (no apple or collision). However, reaching the nearest apple (5,2) from (5,4) would require two left moves.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (4,5), an empty space with no nearby apples.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (4,3), an empty space. From (4,3), the next move LEFT would reach (4,2), which contains an apple. This allows the snake to eat an apple in the next epoch, increasing the score.  \n\nMoving LEFT is safe (no collision with walls or self) and positions the snake to reach an apple in the next step. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#SSSS  #\n#S  S  #\n#S  S  #\n# AHS  #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is located at row 4, column 3 (0-indexed). The current direction is LEFT, meaning the snake is moving left. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid), leaving LEFT, UP, or DOWN as possible directions.\n\n### Analysis of possible moves:\n1. **Moving LEFT**: The head will move to row 4, column 2. This cell contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple is safe (no collision with walls or the snake's body) and will increase the score by 1. The snake will grow in length as it eats the apple.\n2. **Moving UP**: The head will move to row 3, column 3. This cell is empty (' '), so no apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow. No collision occurs, but no score increase.\n3. **Moving DOWN**: The head will move to row 5, column 3. This cell is empty (' '), so no apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow. No collision occurs, but no score increase.\n\nMoving LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple, which is optimal for maximizing the score.

Checking row 5 (\"#AA    #\"), column 2 is an apple ('A'). Eating this apple will increase the score by 1 and grow the snake.  \n\nMoving DOWN is safe (no collision with walls or body) and allows the snake to eat an apple, making it the best choice.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#SSSS A#\n#S AS  #\n#S  S  #\n# SSS  #\n#AH    #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is DOWN.

(4,1) is empty (safe). However, the next move (if direction remains UP) would take the head to (3,1), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S') → collision. Thus, UP leads to a future collision.\n\n### Analysis of DOWN:\n- Moving DOWN takes the head to (6,1). (6,1) is empty (safe). From (6,1), the snake can then move RIGHT toward the apple at (6,4) (row 6, column 4). This path avoids walls and self-collision, allowing the snake to reach an apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#SSSS A#\n#S AS  #\n#   S  #\n# SSS  #\n#SS    #\n#H   A #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at row 6, column 1.

Colliding with a wall ends the game. **Invalid**.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (6,6) would take the head to (7,6), which is a wall (`#`). Colliding with a wall ends the game. **Invalid**.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP from (6,6) takes the head to (5,6). Checking row 5 (`#SS    #`), (5,6) is an empty space (not a wall or snake body).

No body segments are in the immediate upward path of the head.\n\n### Direction Options:\nThe snake cannot reverse direction (UP → DOWN is invalid). Valid options are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n1. **UP**: Next head position is (4,5).  \n   - (4,5) is empty (no wall or body collision).  \n   - Continuing UP leads the head toward (3,5) (empty) and then (2,5) (apple).

However, moving DOWN further risks collision with the snake’s body in row 4 (e.g., (4,3) is an 'S').\n\n### Optimal Move:\nMoving UP positions the snake to approach the apple at (1,4) in the next move, maximizing the chance to eat an apple and grow.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#  H AA#\n#  SSSA#\n#    S #\n# S  S #\n#SS  S #\n#SSSSS #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 1, column 3).\n- **Current Direction**: UP (snake is moving upward).\n- **Collision Risks**: Moving UP would take the head to (row 0, column 3), which is a wall (game ends). Reversing direction to DOWN is invalid (snake cannot reverse direction). Thus, valid directions are LEFT or RIGHT.\n- **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (1,5), (1,6), and (2,6).\n- **Body Positions**: The snake's body ('S') occupies various cells, but neither (1,2) (LEFT target) nor (1,4) (RIGHT target) are part of the body, so both directions are initially safe.\n\n### Direction Analysis:\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (1,2). This cell is empty, but it moves the snake away from the apples, reducing the chance to eat them soon.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (1,4). This cell is empty, and it positions the snake closer to the apples at (1,5) and (1,6). From (1,4), the next move RIGHT would reach (1,5) (an apple), allowing the snake to eat it, grow, and increase the score.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT is optimal as it directs the snake toward the nearest apples, maximizing the chance to eat them and avoid collision.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  SHAA#\n#  SSSA#\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#SS  S #\n#SSSSS #\n########\n\nTo determine the next direction, we analyze the current state:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at (row=1, col=5).\n- Current direction is RIGHT, so the snake cannot reverse to LEFT.\n- Possible directions to consider: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n1. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (row=0, col=5), which is a wall ('#').

The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid).\n- **Possible Directions**: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **UP**: Moving up would take the head to (Row 3, Column 3). This position is empty (no apple). The snake would not gain points, and the board updates with the head at (3,3) (no growth).\n2. **LEFT**: Moving left would take the head to (Row 4, Column 2). This position contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score by 1, and the snake grows (length becomes 2, with the previous head position (4,3) becoming body 'S').\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving right would take the head to (Row 4, Column 4). This position is empty (no apple). The snake gains no points and does not grow.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, maximizing the score. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#AHS   #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Position**: The snake's head ('H') is at (row 4, column 2). The body ('S') is at (row 4, column 3), indicating a length of 2.\n2. **Current Direction**: The snake is moving LEFT. Reversing direction (to RIGHT) is not allowed, so valid directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN.\n3. **Apple Positions**: Apples ('A') are at (row 3, column 3), (row 4, column 1), and (row 5, column 1).\n\n### Analysis of Possible Directions:\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (4, 2) leads to (4, 1), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple will increase the score by 1 and grow the snake. The new head position (4, 1) is safe (no collision with walls or the snake's body).\n- **UP**: Moving UP from (4, 2) leads to (3, 2), an empty space. No apple is present here, so no score gain.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (4, 2) leads to (5, 2), an empty space. No apple is present here, so no score gain.\n\nThe best choice is to move LEFT, as it allows the snake to eat an apple, increasing the score and growing the snake safely.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#HSS   #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, analyze the current game state:\n\n### Current State:\n- **Snake Head (H)**: Position (4,1) (row 4, column 1)\n- **Snake Body (S)**: Positions (4,2), (4,3) (length 3)\n- **Apples (A)**: Positions (1,1), (3,3), (5,2)\n- **Current Direction**: LEFT (snake cannot reverse to RIGHT)\n- **Walls**: Edge columns (0 and 7) and rows (0 and 7) are walls (`#`).\n\n### Possible Directions:\nThe snake can only move UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT (since reversing to RIGHT is invalid).\n\n#### 1. LEFT (Current Direction):\n- Next head position: (4,0) (column 0 is a wall). Collision with wall → game ends. **Invalid**.\n\n#### 2. UP:\n- Next head position: (3,1). Check validity:\n  - (3,1) is empty (no wall or body collision). Safe move.\n  - No apple at (3,1) → snake length remains 3.\n  - After moving, snake positions: H at (3,1), S at (4,1), S at (4,2).\n\n#### 3. DOWN:\n- Next head position: (5,1). Check validity:\n  - (5,1) is empty (no wall or body collision). Safe move.\n  - No apple at (5,1) → snake length remains 3.\n  - After moving, snake positions: H at (5,1), S at (4,1), S at (4,2).\n\n### Strategic Choice:\n- **UP** leads to (3,1), with the nearest apple at (3,3) (2 steps away).\n- **DOWN** leads to (5,1), with the nearest apple at (5,2) (1 step away, reachable by moving RIGHT next epoch). \n\nMoving **DOWN** allows the snake to reach an apple faster (next epoch), maximizing score growth.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#SS    #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and game rules:\n\n### Current State:\n- **Snake Position**: Head (H) at (row 5, column 1). Body (S) at (row 4, column 1) and (row 4, column 2). Length = 3.\n- **Current Direction**: DOWN (snake is moving downward).\n- **Apples**: At (row 1, column 1), (row 3, column 4), and (row 5, column 2).\n- **Epoch**: 4 (game ends after epoch 100).\n\n### Valid Moves (Cannot reverse direction; current direction is DOWN, so UP is invalid):\n1. **DOWN**: New head position = (row 6, column 1). This square is empty (no apple, no collision with walls\/body). The snake moves safely but gains no score.\n2. **LEFT**: New head position = (row 5, column 0). This is a wall (column 0 is a wall in all rows). Collision with walls—game ends. Invalid.\n3. **RIGHT**: New head position = (row 5, column 2). This square contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score by 1, the snake grows (length becomes 4), and no collision occurs (no walls\/body here).\n\n### Optimal Move:\nMoving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple, increase the score, and grow, which is better than moving DOWN (no score gain) or LEFT (fatal collision).\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#A   A #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#SS    #\n#SH    #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: Head (H) is at (row 5, column 2). Body segments (S) are at (5,1), (4,2), and (4,1).\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT (snake is moving right).\n- **Apples**: Located at (1,1), (1,5), and (3,4).\n- **Collision Rules**: The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., RIGHT → LEFT is invalid). Colliding with walls or its own body ends the game.\n\n### Direction Analysis:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP from (5,2) would take the head to (4,2), which is occupied by the snake’s body (S). This causes a collision → **invalid**.\n2. **LEFT**: Reversing the current direction (RIGHT → LEFT) is not allowed → **invalid**.\n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (5,2) takes the head to (6,2), which is empty (no walls or body). However, continuing DOWN from (6,2) would lead to row 7 (a wall) in the next move, risking collision. This path is less optimal.\n4. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (5,2) takes the head to (5,3), which is empty (no walls or body). This direction aligns with a potential path toward the apple at (3,4):  \n   - After moving RIGHT to (5,3), the snake can continue RIGHT to (5,4), then UP to (4,4), and finally UP to (3,4) (the apple). This path avoids collisions and targets an apple.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe safest and most strategic direction is to continue moving RIGHT, as it avoids immediate collisions and positions the snake to reach an apple in subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#A   A #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#S     #\n#SSH   #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (5, 3) (row 5, column 3), with body segments ('S') at (5, 2), (5, 1), and (4, 1). The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). The goal is to choose a safe direction (UP, DOWN, or RIGHT) that avoids collisions and optimizes apple collection.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Directions:\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (5, 4). This is a safe empty space but does not lead to an apple immediately. The next move would still need to navigate toward apples, which are farther away (e.g., (1, 4) or (3, 3)).\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (6, 3), a safe empty space. However, this moves the snake away from the nearest apple at (3, 3), requiring more steps to reorient upward.\n- **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (4, 3), a safe empty space. From here, the next move can continue UP (since the new direction would be UP, avoiding reversal), leading the head to (3, 3) in the following epoch. (3, 3) is occupied by an apple ('A'), meaning the snake would eat it, grow, and increase the score.\n\n### Conclusion:\nChoosing UP positions the snake to reach the nearest apple at (3, 3) in the next move, making it the optimal direction.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A   A #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#  H   #\n#SSS   #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving UP. The snake's head is at (row 4, column 3). The body segments are at (row 5, column 2), (row 5, column 3), and (row 5, column 4). The apples are located at (row 1, column 1), (row 1, column 5), and (row 3, column 4). \n\nThe snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (row 3, column 3), which is empty (no collision with walls or self). This positions the snake closer to the apple at (row 3, column 4) (adjacent to the new head position), allowing a potential RIGHT move next epoch to eat the apple.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (row 4, column 2), which is empty but moves the snake away from the nearest apple (row 3, column 4).  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (row 4, column 4), which is empty but is less direct for reaching the nearest apple compared to UP.  \n\nContinuing UP is optimal as it positions the snake to reach the nearest apple in the next move. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A   A #\n#      #\n#  HA  #\n#  S   #\n# SS   #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP. The snake's head is at (3,2) (row 3, column 2). The snake is moving upward but can choose directions UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (since reversing to DOWN is not allowed). \n\n- **Moving UP**: The head would go to (2,2), which is empty (no apple, no collision). The snake grows normally but does not eat an apple.  \n- **Moving LEFT**: The head would go to (3,1), which is empty (no apple, no collision). The snake grows normally but does not eat an apple.  \n- **Moving RIGHT**: The head would go to (3,3), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1, and the snake grows in length (no tail is removed). There is no collision with walls or the snake's body.  \n\nMoving RIGHT is the optimal choice as it allows the snake to eat an apple and grow. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A   A #\n#      #\n#  SH  #\n#  S A #\n# SS   #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (3,3) (row 3, column 3), and the current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). Possible directions are RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. \n\n### Analysis of possible moves:\n- **RIGHT**: The head moves to (3,4) (a space). Safe, no collision. This positions the head one step left of the apple at (4,4) (row 4, column 4).\n- **UP**: The head moves to (2,3) (a space). Safe, but this moves the head away from the nearest apple at (4,4).\n- **DOWN**: The head moves to (4,3) (a space). Safe, and this positions the head one step left of the apple at (4,4) (row 4, column 4).\n\n### Optimal choice:\nThe nearest apple is at (4,4). Moving DOWN places the head at (4,3), which is one step left of the apple. From (4,3), the next move (RIGHT) can reach the apple directly.

This square contains 'S' (snake's body). Moving LEFT causes a self-collision, ending the game. **Invalid**.  \n2. **UP**: Reverses the current direction (DOWN → UP), which is not allowed. **Invalid**.  \n3. **DOWN**: Next head position = (5, 3). This square is empty (no walls or body parts). Safe but no apple, so no score gain.  \n4. **RIGHT**: Next head position = (4, 4). This square contains 'A' (apple). Moving RIGHT eats the apple, increases the score by 1, and grows the snake.

The body (S) segments are at (4,4), (4,3), (3,4), (3,3), and (5,3).\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). Valid next directions: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n- **Apple Positions**: Apples (A) are at (1,1), (1,5), and (5,6).\n\n### Analysis of Possible Moves:\n1. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (4,6). This cell is empty (no apple), and no collision occurs. However, moving RIGHT again in the next step would hit the wall (column 7 is a wall), limiting future options.\n2. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (3,5). This cell is empty (no apple), and no collision occurs. Reaching the apple at (1,5) would require multiple subsequent UP moves, which is less efficient.\n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (5,5). This cell is empty (no apple), but from (5,5), the next move RIGHT would reach (5,6), which contains an apple. This path allows eating an apple in the next epoch (epoch 12), maximizing score growth.\n\n### Conclusion:\nChoosing DOWN allows the snake to position itself to eat the apple at (5,6) in the next move, making it the optimal direction.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A   A #\n#      #\n#  SS  #\n#  SSS #\n#    HA#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is located at position (row 5, column 4), moving in the current direction DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction (UP is invalid), so valid directions are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **Moving DOWN**: The head would move to (row 6, column 4), which is a safe empty space but contains no apple. The snake does not grow.  \n- **Moving LEFT**: The head would move to (row 5, column 3), which is a safe empty space but contains no apple. The snake does not grow.  \n- **Moving RIGHT**: The head would move to (row 5, column 5), which contains an apple 'A'. Eating the apple increases the score by 1, and the snake grows in length. This position is safe (not a wall or body segment).  \n\nThe best choice is to move RIGHT to eat the apple and grow the snake. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#A   A #\n#      #\n#  SS  #\n#  SSS #\n#    SH#\n#A     #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The snake's head ('H') is at (row 5, column 5).

The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid).\n- **Apples**: Located at (1,1), (1,5), and (6,1).\n- **Collision Risks**: Walls are around the edges (row 0, row 7, column 0, column 7). The snake loses if it hits walls or itself.\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **RIGHT**: The head would move to (5,6) (a safe space, no apple). However, moving RIGHT again would hit a wall (column 7) next, limiting future movement.\n2. **DOWN**: The head would move to (6,5) (a safe space, no apple). Moving DOWN again would hit a wall (row 7), making this path risky.\n3. **UP**: The head would move to (4,5) (a safe space, no apple). This direction leads toward the apple at (1,5). Continuing UP from (4,5) would reach (3,5), (2,5), and eventually (1,5) (the apple), allowing the snake to eat it and grow.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP is optimal, as it positions the snake to reach the apple at (1,5) in subsequent moves without immediate collision risks.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#A   A #\n#      #\n#  SS  #\n#   SSH#\n#    SS#\n#A     #\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, we analyze the current game board, snake position, and possible moves:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 4, column 5).\n- **Current Direction**: UP (snake cannot reverse to DOWN).\n- **Snake Body**: The body 'S' occupies positions (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5).\n- **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (1,1), (1,4), and (6,1).\n\n### Valid Moves (Cannot Reverse Direction):\n- **UP**: Moving to (3,5). Check (3,5): Row 3 is \"#  SS  #\", so (3,5) is empty (safe).\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (4,4). (4,4) is 'S' (body collision, invalid).\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (4,6).

(5,5) is 'S' (body collision, invalid).\n\n### Strategy:\nThe closest apple is at (1,4) (Manhattan distance 4 from the head). Moving UP allows the snake to approach this apple:\n- From (4,5) → UP to (3,5) (empty, safe).\n- Next, turning LEFT to (3,4) (empty), then UP to (2,4), and finally UP to (1,4) (apple).\n\nThus, moving UP is the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#A   A #\n#      #\n#   S H#\n#   SSS#\n#    SS#\n#A     #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n- **Snake Head Position**: (Row 3, Column 5) (marked as 'H').\n- **Current Direction**: UP (snake cannot reverse to DOWN).\n- **Apples**: Located at (Row 1, Column 1), (Row 1, Column 5), and (Row 6, Column 1).\n- **Body Segments**: S positions are (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (5,5).\n\n### Possible Moves (Non-reversing):\n1. **UP**: New head position is (Row 2, Column 5). This cell is empty (no wall or body collision). Moving UP keeps the snake on a path toward the apple at (Row 1, Column 5), which is 2 rows above the current head.\n2. **LEFT**: New head position is (Row 3, Column 4). This cell is empty but does not lead directly toward an apple.\n3. **RIGHT**: New head position is (Row 3, Column 6). This cell is empty but also does not lead directly toward an apple.\n\n### Strategy:\nThe closest apple is at (Row 1, Column 5), 2 rows above the head. Moving UP now aligns the snake to reach this apple in the next move (epoch 16), where the head would move to (Row 1, Column 5) and eat the apple. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A   A #\n#     H#\n#     S#\n#   SSS#\n#    SS#\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at (row 2, column 6), and the current direction is UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (2,7), which is a wall (column 7 is a wall). This causes a collision, so RIGHT is invalid.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (1,6), which is a space (no apple). The snake remains safe, but the next move (UP) would hit a wall (row 0), limiting options to LEFT.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (2,5), which is a space (no apple). This direction keeps the snake safe and allows more flexibility for future moves (LEFT, UP, or DOWN), avoiding immediate walls and potential body collisions.  \n\nBetween UP and LEFT, LEFT is better as it avoids a wall in the next step and provides more movement options to reach apples (e.g., the apple at (1,4) is closer from (2,5) than from (1,6)).  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A   A #\n#    HS#\n#     S#\n#    SS#\n#    SS#\n#A     #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 2, column 4).

This is a safe empty space (no collision), but no apple here. No score gain.\n\n2. **UP**:  \n   Next head position: (1,4) (row 2 → 1). This square contains an apple ('A').  \n   - **Safety Check**: (1,4) is not a wall (row 1 is within bounds, column 4 is not a wall column).  \n   - **Self-Collision Check**: (1,4) is not occupied by any body segment (current body segments are at (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,5), (5,6)).  \n   - **Outcome**: Eating the apple increases the score by 1 and grows the snake.\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   Next head position: (3,4) (row 2 → 3). This is a safe empty space (no collision), but no apple here. No score gain.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP leads to eating an apple, which is optimal for maximizing the score. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#A   H #\n#    SS#\n#     S#\n#    SS#\n#A   SS#\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe current direction is UP, and the snake's head is at (row 1, column 5). Moving UP would take the head to row 0, column 5, which is a wall (game over). Reversing direction (DOWN) is not allowed. The remaining options are LEFT and RIGHT. \n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (1, 6). From there, the next possible moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) all lead to collisions (wall or body). This is a dead end.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (1, 4), which is safe (no wall or body). Subsequent LEFT moves can then approach the apple at (1, 1) in future steps.  \n\nThus, the safest and most strategic direction is LEFT. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A  HS #\n#    SS#\n#     S#\n#     S#\n#A   SS#\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (1,4) (row 1, column 4) with a current direction of LEFT.

This causes a collision with the wall, ending the game.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (2,4), which is occupied by the snake's body (row 2, column 4 is 'S'). This causes a self-collision, ending the game.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (1,3), which is an empty space (no wall or body collision). This is a safe move.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A HSS #\n#    SS#\n#     S#\n#     S#\n#A    S#\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (row 1, column 3), moving in the current direction LEFT.

This causes a collision, ending the game. Invalid.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (row 2, column 3), a safe empty space (no collision with walls or the snake's body). However, this does not lead directly to an apple.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (row 1, column 2), a safe empty space (no collision). Importantly, the next move (if direction remains LEFT) would take the head to (row 1, column 1), which contains an apple ('A'). This sets up the snake to eat an apple in the following epoch, increasing the score.  \n\nThus, the optimal direction is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#AHSSS #\n#    SS#\n#     S#\n#     S#\n#A     #\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (1,2) (row 1, column 2), and the current direction is LEFT.

Invalid.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (1,2) leads to (2,2), which is empty. No collision, but no apple. Safe but no score gain.\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (1,2) leads to (1,1), which contains an apple (A). Eating the apple increases the score, grows the snake, and avoids collision (no walls or body segments at (1,1)). Safe and beneficial.\n- **RIGHT**: Reverses direction (current is LEFT), invalid.\n\nThe best move is LEFT, as it safely eats an apple and grows the snake.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#HSSSS #\n#    SS#\n# A   S#\n#     S#\n#A     #\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (1,1) (row 1, column 1) and is currently moving LEFT.

This position is within the play area (row 2, column 1) and not occupied by the snake's body (body segments are at (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,5), (4,6)), so it is safe.  \n\nThus, the only valid direction to avoid collision is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SSSSS #\n#H   SS#\n# A   S#\n#      #\n#A     #\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (2,1) (row 2, column 1), and it is currently moving DOWN. The goal is to choose a direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) that allows the snake to eat apples safely without colliding with walls or its own body.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Directions:\n1. **UP**: The snake cannot reverse direction (current direction is DOWN, so UP is invalid).  \n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (2,1) would take the head to (2,0), which is a wall (row 2 starts with '#'). Collision with the wall would end the game.  \n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (2,1) would take the head to (2,2), a safe empty space. However, this direction does not directly lead toward the apples at (5,1) and (6,1) in the lower left.  \n4. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (2,1) takes the head to (3,1), a safe empty space. This direction aligns with the column containing two apples at (5,1) and (6,1). Continuing to move DOWN from (3,1) would allow the snake to reach (4,1) (safe), (5,1) (apple), and (6,1) (apple) in subsequent moves, maximizing apple consumption.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN is the optimal choice, as it positions the snake to safely reach the apples at (5,1) and (6,1) in subsequent epochs.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SSSSS #\n#S   SS#\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#A     #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and game rules:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The head ('H') is at (3,1) (row 3, column 1).

This causes a collision, ending the game.\n3. **RIGHT**: Next head position is (3,2), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1, grows the snake, and avoids collisions (no wall or self-collision).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple, grow, and continue safely.

No snake body (`S`) is present at (3,5), so this move is safe. Eating the apple increases the score and grows the snake. **Valid and beneficial**.\n3. **DOWN**: The head would move to (5,5). Row 5 (`#SSSS  #`) shows (5,5) is empty space.

This position is empty (no apple or body), so the snake moves safely but gains no score.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (3,4), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score by 1, and the snake grows in length. This position is not occupied by the snake's body, so it is safe.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (3,6), which is empty (no apple or body).

Checking (1,3) on the board, it contains an apple ('A'). Moving UP here is valid (no collision with walls or body), and the snake will eat the apple, increasing the score.  \n- **LEFT**: The next head position would be (2,2).

No apple is eaten, and the snake remains length 1.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (4,4), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1, grows the snake to length 2, and removes the apple at (4,4). This move is safe (no collision with walls or self) and immediately rewards with an apple.  \n\nThus, the optimal direction is RIGHT. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SHA #\n#    A #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is RIGHT, and the head ('H') is at position (row 4, column 4). The body ('S') is at (row 4, column 3). The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\n### Analysis of each valid direction:\n1. **RIGHT**: The head moves to (row 4, column 5), which contains an apple ('A'). This is safe (no wall or self-collision). Eating the apple increases the score and grows the snake. The new head will be at (4,5), with the body updating to include the old head (4,4) and old body (4,3).\n\n2. **DOWN**: The head moves to (row 5, column 4), which also contains an apple ('A'). This is safe (no wall or self-collision). Eating the apple increases the score and grows the snake. The new head will be at (5,4), with the body updating to include the old head (4,4) and old body (4,3).\n\n3. **UP**: The head moves to (row 3, column 4), which is empty. No apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow. This is safe but does not improve the score.\n\n### Optimal Choice:\nBoth RIGHT and DOWN lead to eating an apple, but moving RIGHT continues the current direction (no need to change direction) and directly targets the apple in the snake's forward path. This is the most straightforward and immediate way to increase the score.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SSHA#\n#    A #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (4,4) (row 4, column 4), with body segments at (4,3) and (4,2). The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse to LEFT. The goal is to choose a direction (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) that allows the snake to eat an apple safely.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Directions:\n1. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (4,5), which is an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1. After moving, the snake's new positions would be: head at (4,5), body segments at (4,4), (4,3), (4,2). This is safe as none of these positions collide with walls or the snake's own body.\n\n2. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (5,4), which is also an apple ('A'). However, after eating this apple, the snake's new positions would include (4,4) as a body segment. If the next move is UP (a valid direction change from DOWN), the head would move to (4,4), colliding with the snake's own body. This creates a collision risk.\n\n3. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (3,4), a blank space (' '). No apple is eaten here, so the score does not increase. This is safe but less optimal for maximizing the score.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple safely without immediate collision risks, making it the best choice.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SSSH#\n#    AA#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4,5) (row 4, column 5). The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). The possible directions to choose are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\n- **Moving RIGHT**: The next head position would be (4,6). This position is empty (no apple) and safe (no wall or self-collision). No apple is eaten.\n- **Moving UP**: The next head position would be (3,5). This position is empty (no apple) and safe (no wall or self-collision). No apple is eaten.\n- **Moving DOWN**: The next head position would be (5,5). This position contains an apple ('A'). Moving here is safe (no wall or self-collision) and allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score and growing the snake's length.\n\nThe optimal choice is to move DOWN to eat the apple. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A   #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#  SSSS#\n#    AH#\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: Head (H) is at (5,5) (row 5, column 5). The body (S) occupies (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5).\n- **Current Direction**: DOWN (snake cannot reverse to UP).\n- **Apples**: At (1,2), (2,1), and (5,4) (row 5, column 4).\n- **Goal**: Eat apples to grow and increase the score.\n\n### Possible Moves:\n1. **UP**: Invalid (cannot reverse direction from DOWN).\n2. **DOWN**: Next head position is (6,5). This cell is empty (no apple), so no score gain.\n3. **RIGHT**: Next head position is (5,6). This cell is empty (no apple), so no score gain.\n4. **LEFT**: Next head position is (5,4). This cell contains an apple ('A'). Eating it will increase the score by 1 and grow the snake. No collision with walls or self (body segments are at (4,2)-(4,5) and (5,5)).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT allows the snake to eat the apple at (5,4), which is optimal for maximizing the score.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A   #\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#  SSSS#\n#    HS#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT. The head (H) is at position (row 5, column 4). The snake's body (S) extends from (5,5) down to (4,6) and left along row 4 to (4,3). \n\n### Analysis of possible directions:\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (4,4), which is occupied by the snake's body (S). This causes a self-collision, ending the game. **Invalid**.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (6,4), which is empty (safe). However, this direction does not lead toward any apples quickly and may limit future movement (row 7 is a wall).\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (5,3), which is empty (safe). This direction aligns with a potential path toward the apple at (2,1) (row 2, column 1). Continuing LEFT allows the snake to navigate leftward, then upward toward the apple without colliding with walls or its body.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe safest and most strategic direction to pursue apples while avoiding collisions is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A   #\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#   SSS#\n#   HSS#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT. The possible directions to choose are LEFT, UP, or DOWN (since reversing direction to RIGHT is not allowed). \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head from (5,3) to (4,3), which is occupied by the snake's body (S). This causes a collision, ending the game. Thus, UP is invalid.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (6,3), which is empty (no wall or body collision). This is safe but moves the snake away from the apples (located at (1,2), (2,1), (3,6)).\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (5,2), which is empty (no collision). This direction keeps the snake closer to the apples in the upper part of the board (e.g., (1,2) and (2,1)), allowing potential future paths to reach and eat apples.\n\nGiven the goal of eating apples, moving LEFT is the optimal choice as it positions the snake to approach the nearest apples.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A   #\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#    SS#\n#  HSSS#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (5, 2) (row 5, column 2) and is currently moving LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so possible next directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT. \n\n### Analysis of possible directions:\n1. **LEFT**: New head position would be (5, 1). This is an empty cell (no wall or body collision), but there is no apple here. Moving LEFT avoids immediate danger but does not lead directly toward any apple.\n\n2. **DOWN**: New head position would be (6, 2). This is an empty cell (no collision), but there is no apple here. Moving DOWN leads into an empty area with no clear path to apples.\n\n3. **UP**: New head position would be (4, 2). This is an empty cell (no collision), and this direction aligns with the apple at (1, 2) (row 1, column 2). Moving UP positions the snake to eventually reach this apple by continuing upward in subsequent moves (e.g., (4, 2) → (3, 2) → (2, 2) → (1, 2)).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP is the best choice as it directs the snake toward an apple while avoiding collisions.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#  H  S#\n#  SSSS#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (row 4, column 2) with a current direction of UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n### Analysis of Possible Moves:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (row 3, column 2), which is a safe empty space. This avoids collision with walls or the snake's body (current body segments are at (4,5), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)).  \n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (row 4, column 1), which is also a safe empty space. This avoids collision with walls or the body.  \n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (row 4, column 3), which is a safe empty space.  \n\n### Prioritizing Apple Consumption:\nApples are located at (1,2), (2,1), and (3,6). Moving LEFT allows the snake to approach the apple at (2,1) (row 2, column 1) more directly. From (4,1) (after moving LEFT), the snake can then move UP twice to reach (2,1) and eat the apple. This path avoids the body and walls.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A   #\n#A     #\n#     A#\n# HS   #\n#  SSSS#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4,2) (row 4, column 2), and the current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). We need to evaluate possible directions (LEFT, UP, DOWN) for the next move:\n\n### 1. DOWN\nMoving DOWN would take the head to (5,2). Row 5, column 2 is 'S' (part of the snake's body). This causes a self-collision, ending the game. **DOWN is invalid.**\n\n### 2. LEFT\nMoving LEFT takes the head to (4,1). This position is empty (no wall or body collision). The snake does not eat an apple here. However, moving LEFT again in the next step would lead to (4,0), which is a wall (column 0 is a wall), risking a collision. While LEFT is safe for this move, it limits future movement options.\n\n### 3. UP\nMoving UP takes the head to (3,2). This position is empty (no wall or body collision). The snake does not eat an apple here, but this direction allows the snake to move toward the nearest apple at (2,1) (row 2, column 1) in subsequent steps. Unlike LEFT, UP avoids proximity to the left wall and provides more space for future movement.\n\nBetween the valid options (LEFT and UP), UP is preferable as it avoids potential wall collisions in the next step and allows the snake to approach the nearest apple more safely.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A   #\n#A     #\n# H   A#\n# SS   #\n#  SSS #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (3,1) (row 3, column 1) and is currently moving UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., cannot turn to DOWN). \n\nAnalyzing possible moves:\n- **UP**: Moving UP from (3,1) leads to (2,1), which contains an apple ('A'). This position is not a wall or part of the snake's body (current body segments are at (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4)). Eating the apple here is safe and increases the score.\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (3,1) leads to (3,0), which is a wall ('#'). This would cause a collision and end the game.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (3,1) leads to (3,2), which is empty (no apple). This move does not eat an apple.\n- **DOWN**: Reversing direction (from UP to DOWN) is invalid per game rules.\n\nThe optimal move is to continue moving UP to eat the apple at (2,1).\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#AH    #\n# S   A#\n# SS   #\n#  SS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (row 2, column 2), and the current direction is UP. The snake can choose to move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (since reversing to DOWN is not allowed). \n\n- **Moving UP** would take the head to (row 1, column 2), which is a safe empty space but contains no apple.  \n- **Moving RIGHT** would take the head to (row 2, column 3), which is also a safe empty space with no apple.  \n- **Moving LEFT** would take the head to (row 2, column 1), which is occupied by an apple ('A'). Eating this apple would increase the score by 1 and allow the snake to grow.  \n\nSince the goal is to eat as many apples as possible, moving LEFT to consume the apple directly adjacent to the head is the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#HS    #\n#AS   A#\n# SS   #\n#  SS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Position**: The head ('H') is at (row 2, column 1). The body ('S') segments are at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4).\n2. **Current Direction**: LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid).\n3. **Possible Moves**:\n   - **LEFT**: The head would move to (2,0), which is a wall (collision, game over).\n   - **UP**: The head would move to (1,1), an empty space (safe but no apple).\n   - **DOWN**: The head would move to (3,1), which contains an apple ('A') (safe, eats apple, score increases).\n   - **RIGHT**: Reverse direction (invalid per rules).\n\nMoving DOWN is the best choice: it avoids collision, allows the snake to eat an apple, and grows the snake.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#SS A  #\n#HS   A#\n# SS   #\n#  SS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Current Snake Position and Direction\n- The snake's head 'H' is at (row 3, column 1).\n- Current direction is DOWN, so the snake cannot reverse to UP (invalid direction).\n\n### Possible Directions to Consider:\n1. **LEFT**: Moving left from (3,1) would take the head to (3,0), which is a wall (`#`). Collision with the wall → Game Over.\n2. **RIGHT**: Moving right from (3,1) would take the head to (3,2), which is occupied by the snake's body (`S`). Collision with self → Game Over.\n3. **DOWN**: Moving down from (3,1) would take the head to (4,1). Checking row 4 (`# SS   #`), column 1 is empty (space). No collision → Safe move.\n\n### Conclusion\nOnly moving DOWN avoids collision with walls or the snake's body. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#SS A  #\n#SS   A#\n#HSS   #\n#  S   #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n- **Snake Head Position**: (Row 4, Column 1) (marked as 'H').\n- **Current Direction**: DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction, so UP is invalid.\n- **Possible Directions**: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (UP is reversed and disallowed).\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **UP**: Reverses the current direction (DOWN → UP), which is invalid.  \n2. **LEFT**: New head position would be (Row 4, Column 0), which is a wall ('#'). Collision with the wall ends the game.  \n3. **RIGHT**: New head position would be (Row 4, Column 2), which is part of the snake's body ('S'). Collision with itself ends the game.  \n4. **DOWN**: New head position is (Row 5, Column 1), which is an empty space (' '). No collision occurs, and the snake moves safely.  \n\nThe only valid and safe direction is DOWN.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A   #\n#SS A  #\n#SS   A#\n#SSS   #\n#H     #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (5, 1) (row 5, column 1). The current direction is DOWN, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so UP is invalid). The snake must choose between LEFT, RIGHT, or continuing DOWN. \n\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (5, 1) would take the head to (5, 0), which is a wall (row 5 starts with '#'). This causes a collision, ending the game. Thus, LEFT is invalid.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (5, 1) takes the head to (6, 1), which is empty (safe). However, the next move in the DOWN direction would lead to (7, 1), a wall (row 7 is all '#'), risking collision. This path does not lead toward apples quickly.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (5, 1) takes the head to (5, 2), which is empty (safe). This direction allows the snake to navigate toward apples located at (2, 4) and (3, 6) in subsequent moves. For example, after moving RIGHT, the snake can continue right to (5, 3), (5, 4), then up toward (4, 4), (3, 4), and eventually reach the apple at (2, 4).  \n\nRIGHT is the safest and most strategic choice to approach apples without immediate collision risks.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A   #\n#SS A  #\n#SS   A#\n#SS    #\n#SH    #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (5, 2) (row 5, column 2), moving RIGHT. The snake's body (S) occupies positions (5, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2). The apples (A) are at (1, 2), (2, 4), and (3, 5).\n\n### Analysis of possible directions:\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (4, 2), which is occupied by the snake's body (S). This causes a self-collision, ending the game. **Invalid**.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (6, 2), which is empty (safe). However, this direction moves the snake away from the nearest apples and limits future movement options (row 7 is a wall).\n- **LEFT**: Reversing direction (current direction is RIGHT), which is not allowed. **Invalid**.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (5, 3), which is empty (safe). This direction allows the snake to approach the apple at (2, 4) in subsequent moves (e.g., continuing right to (5, 4), then up to (4, 4), (3, 4), and finally (2, 4) where the apple is located).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe safest and most strategic direction is RIGHT, as it avoids collisions and positions the snake to reach an apple in future moves.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A   #\n#SS A  #\n#SS   A#\n#S     #\n#SSH   #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is located at position (5,3) (row 5, column 3). The current direction is RIGHT, so the snake cannot reverse to LEFT. The possible directions to choose are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n### Analysis of possible moves:\n1. **RIGHT**: The next head position would be (5,4). Checking this position: row 5 is \"#SSH   #\", so (5,4) is a space (no wall, body, or apple). Moving RIGHT is safe. This direction allows the snake to move toward apples in the upper-right area (e.g., (2,4) and (3,5)) in subsequent steps.  \n2. **UP**: The next head position would be (4,3). This is a space (safe), but moving UP does not directly lead toward the nearest apples as effectively as RIGHT.  \n3. **DOWN**: The next head position would be (6,3). This is a space (safe), but moving DOWN risks hitting the wall (row 7 is a wall) in subsequent moves, making it less optimal.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT is safe, maintains progress toward apples, and avoids immediate risks. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A   #\n#SS A  #\n#S    A#\n#S     #\n#SSSH  #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (5,4) (row 5, column 4) and is currently moving RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n- **RIGHT**: Next head position is (5,5). This cell is empty (no apple or body), so safe but no apple.  \n- **DOWN**: Next head position is (6,4). This cell is empty (no apple or body), so safe but no apple.  \n- **UP**: Next head position is (4,4). This cell is empty (no apple or body), so safe. Moving UP aligns the snake with the apple at (2,4) (row 2, column 4), which is directly above the current head. Continuing UP from (4,4) would lead the snake toward this apple in subsequent moves.  \n\nChoosing UP is optimal as it positions the snake to reach an apple in the next few steps. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A   #\n#S  A  #\n#S    A#\n#S  H  #\n#SSSS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving UP and cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). The possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. The goal is to navigate toward apples while avoiding self-collision or walls.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Directions:\n1. **UP**: The head would move to (3,3) (row 3, column 3), which is empty. This is safe but does not lead directly toward an apple quickly.\n2. **LEFT**: The head would move to (4,2) (row 4, column 2), which is empty. This is safe but requires more steps to reach the nearest apple (at (2,4)).\n3. **RIGHT**: The head would move to (4,4) (row 4, column 4), which is empty. From (4,4), the next move UP would reach (3,4), then another UP to (2,4) (where an apple is located). This path allows the snake to reach an apple in 2 subsequent moves, making it the most efficient option.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A   #\n#   A  #\n#S    A#\n#S  SH #\n#SSSS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state:\n- **Head position (H):** (4,5) (row 4, column 5)\n- **Current direction:** RIGHT (cannot reverse to LEFT)\n- **Possible directions:** UP, DOWN, RIGHT (since reversing to LEFT is invalid)\n- **Apples remaining:** At (1,2), (2,3), (3,5)\n\n### Analysis of each possible direction:\n1. **UP:** Moving UP from (4,5) leads to (3,5), which contains an apple ('A'). This is safe (no collision with walls or body segments) and allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score and growing in length.\n2. **RIGHT:** Moving RIGHT from (4,5) leads to (4,6), a safe empty space. However, no apple is present here, so the snake does not grow.\n3. **DOWN:** Moving DOWN from (4,5) leads to (5,5), a safe empty space. No apple is present here either, so the snake does not grow.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP allows the snake to eat an apple, which is the most beneficial action. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A   #\n#   A  #\n#    HA#\n#S  SS #\n#SSSS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (3,4) (row 3, column 4), and the current direction is UP.

This is a safe, empty space but contains no apple.  \n- **LEFT**: Next head position would be (3,3). This is a safe, empty space but contains no apple.  \n- **RIGHT**: Next head position would be (3,5), which is occupied by an apple (A). Moving RIGHT is allowed (not reversing direction), and this position is not a wall or part of the snake's body.

No apple is present here, and there is no collision with the snake's body or walls. This is safe but does not increase the score.\n- **Moving LEFT**: The next position would be (row 2, column 4), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple would increase the score by 1 and grow the snake. The position (row 2, column 4) is not occupied by the snake's body (all 'S' positions are in rows 3, 4, 5), so this move is safe.\n- **Moving RIGHT**: The next position would be (row 2, column 6), which is a space.

Moving LEFT is valid (no wall\/self-collision) and will eat the apple, increasing the score by 1.\n2. **UP**: The head will move to (1,4), which is empty (no apple).

This position is not part of the snake's body (body segments are in rows 2-5), so it is safe. Eating the apple increases the score and grows the snake.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving right from (1,4) leads to (1,5), which also contains an apple (A).

The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#   AA #\n#    A #\n# SSS  #\n#SSSSSS#\n#SSSSSS#\n# SSSSH#\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 64\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n"],"action":"UP","response":["\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  HA  #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n- The snake's head ('H') is at position (row 4, column 3).\n- Current direction: UP (snake cannot reverse to DOWN).\n- Apples ('A') are at (row 1, column 2), (row 4, column 4), and (row 5, column 3).\n- Possible directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is invalid as it reverses the current direction).\n\n### Analysis of each direction:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (row 3, column 3), which is empty (no apple). The snake does not grow, and no score is added.\n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (row 4, column 2), which is empty (no apple). The snake does not grow, and no score is added.\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (row 4, column 4), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1, grows the snake (length becomes 2), and the previous head position (row 4, column 3) becomes part of the body ('S'). This is safe (no wall or self-collision).\n\nThe RIGHT direction allows the snake to immediately eat an apple, making it the best choice.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#  A A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SH  #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, analyze the current state:\n\n- **Snake Position**: Head (H) at (4,3), Body (S) at (4,2). Current direction is RIGHT.\n- **Apples**: At (1,2), (1,4), and (5,3).\n- **Possible Directions**: Cannot reverse (LEFT is invalid). Options: RIGHT, UP, DOWN.\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **RIGHT**: Head moves to (4,4) (empty). No apple eaten. Body shifts to (4,3). Safe but no score gain.\n2. **UP**: Head moves to (3,3) (empty). No apple eaten. Body shifts to (4,3). Safe but no score gain.\n3. **DOWN**: Head moves to (5,3), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple grows the snake (length increases), adds 1 to the score, and avoids collision (no walls or self-collision). This is the best option.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SS  #\n# A H  #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (5, 3) (row 5, column 3) and is currently moving DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction, so it cannot turn UP. The possible directions to choose from are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN. \n\n- **Moving DOWN**: The head would move to (6, 3), which is an empty space. No apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow.  \n- **Moving RIGHT**: The head would move to (5, 4), which is an empty space. No apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow.  \n- **Moving LEFT**: The head would move to (5, 2), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1, the snake grows in length, and this position is safe (no wall or self-collision).  \n\nChoosing LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple, which is optimal. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   S  #\n# AHS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (5,2) (row 5, column 2), with body segments (S) at (5,3) and (4,3). The current direction is LEFT, and the snake is moving left. \n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze possible moves (LEFT, UP, DOWN; RIGHT is invalid as it reverses direction):\n- **LEFT**: The next head position is (5,1), which contains an apple ('A'). Moving LEFT here allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score by 1 and growing the snake. The new head will be at (5,1), and the body will follow (previous head and body positions: (5,2), (5,3), (4,3)). This move is safe (no wall or self-collision).\n- **UP**: The next head position is (4,2), an empty space. No apple is eaten, so the snake does not grow. This move is safe but does not improve the score.\n- **DOWN**: The next head position is (6,2), an empty space. No apple is eaten, so the snake does not grow. This move is safe but does not improve the score.\n\nMoving LEFT is the best choice as it allows the snake to eat an apple, grow, and increase the score.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   S  #\n# HSS  #\n#     A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (5,1) (row 5, column 1) and is currently moving LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so the allowed directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (RIGHT is reversed and invalid). \n\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (5,0), which is a wall (column 0 in row 5 is '#'). This causes a wall collision, ending the game.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (4,1), which is empty (no collision). The snake does not eat an apple here.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (6,1), which is empty (no collision). The snake does not eat an apple here, but this direction positions the head closer to the apple at (6,5) (row 6, column 5), allowing a potential path to reach that apple in subsequent moves.  \n\nBetween the safe options (UP and DOWN), moving DOWN is more strategic as it aligns the snake with the nearest apple at (6,5), increasing the chance to eat it and grow. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#  A A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# SSS  #\n# H   A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at row 6, column 1. The current direction is DOWN, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so UP is invalid). The possible directions to consider are LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN. \n\n- **Moving DOWN**: The head would move to row 7, column 1, which is a wall (row 7 is all '#'). This causes a collision with the wall, ending the game.  \n- **Moving LEFT**: The head would move to row 6, column 0, which is a wall (column 0 is '#'). This also causes a wall collision, ending the game.  \n- **Moving RIGHT**: The head would move to row 6, column 2, which is an empty space (' '). This position does not collide with the snake's body (the body segments are at row 5, columns 2, 3, 4) or walls. This is a safe move.  \n\nThus, the only valid and safe direction is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#  A A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# SS   #\n# SH  A#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: Head (H) is at (6,3).

The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid).\n- **Possible Directions**: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (since reversing to LEFT is not allowed).\n- **Apples**: Located at (1,2), (1,4), and (6,5).\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (6,4). This square is empty (not a wall or body segment), so it is safe. The snake does not eat an apple here (apple at (6,5) is further right), but the move avoids collision.\n2. **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (5,3), which is occupied by the snake’s own body (S). This causes a self-collision, ending the game.\n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (7,3), which is a wall (#). This causes a wall collision, ending the game.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only safe direction is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S    #\n# SSH A#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (6,4) (row 6, column 4). The current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). Let's evaluate possible moves:\n\n- **RIGHT**: The next head position is (6,5), which contains an apple (A). Moving RIGHT is valid (no collision with walls or self), and eating the apple increases the score. This is safe and beneficial.\n- **UP**: The next head position is (5,4), which is empty. No apple is present here, so the snake grows but does not gain a score. This is safe but not optimal.\n- **DOWN**: The next head position is (7,4), which is a wall (#). This would cause a collision and end the game. Invalid.\n- **LEFT**: Opposite of current direction (RIGHT), which is not allowed. Invalid.\n\nThe best move is to continue RIGHT to eat the apple. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# SSSHA#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (6,5) (row 6, column 5). The current direction is RIGHT, so the snake cannot reverse to LEFT. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (6,6), which contains an apple (A). Eating this apple increases the score by 1 and grows the snake. The new head position (6,6) is within the board (no wall collision) and does not collide with the snake's body (current body segments are at (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)). This is a safe and beneficial move.\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (5,5), an empty space. This is safe but does not eat an apple.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (7,5), which is a wall (row 7 is the bottom wall). This causes a collision, ending the game.\n\nThe optimal choice is to move RIGHT to eat the apple and increase the score. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A A #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# SSSSH#\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (6,6) (row 6, column 6). The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). \n\n- Moving RIGHT would take the head to (6,7), which is a wall ('#'), causing a collision.  \n- Moving DOWN would take the head to (7,6), which is also a wall ('#'), causing a collision.  \n- Moving LEFT is a reverse of the current direction (RIGHT → LEFT), which is not allowed.  \n- Moving UP takes the head to (5,6), which is an empty space (no collision with walls or the snake's body).  \n\nThus, the only safe and valid direction is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A A #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     H#\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's position, current direction (UP), and the board layout:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The snake's head (H) is at (row 5, column 6). The body (S) occupies row 6, columns 2-5 (positions: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)).\n- **Current Direction**: UP (snake cannot reverse to DOWN).\n- **Apples**: Located at (1,2), (1,4), and (2,2).\n- **Valid Moves**: The snake can only move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (DOWN is invalid as it reverses direction). RIGHT leads to a wall (column 7 in row 5 is a wall), so only UP and LEFT are valid.\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n1. **UP**: The head moves to (4,6) (row 4, column 6). This is a safe, empty space. However, this direction does not directly lead toward the nearest apples (e.g., (1,4) is 6 units away).\n2. **LEFT**: The head moves to (5,5) (row 5, column 5). This is a safe, empty space. Moving LEFT positions the snake closer to the nearest apple at (1,4) (Manhattan distance reduces from 6 to 5). This direction allows a clearer path to reach apples in subsequent moves (e.g., LEFT again to (5,4), then UP toward (1,4)).\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT is the better choice as it positions the snake closer to the nearest apple and avoids unnecessary detours.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#  A A #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    HS#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (row 5, column 4). The current direction is LEFT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). The snake must choose between LEFT, UP, or DOWN. \n\n### Analysis of possible directions:\n1. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (5,4) would take the head to (6,4), which is occupied by the snake's body (S). This causes a self-collision. **DOWN is invalid**.\n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (5,4) takes the head to (5,3), which is empty (no walls or body segments). This is safe but does not reach an apple immediately.\n3. **UP**: Moving UP from (5,4) takes the head to (4,4), which is empty (no walls or body segments). This is safe and moves the snake toward the apples located in the upper rows (rows 1 and 2).\n\n### Optimal choice:\nMoving UP directs the snake toward the apples (A) in the upper part of the board (rows 1 and 2), avoiding collision risks and positioning the snake to reach apples in subsequent moves. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#  A A #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#    H #\n#    SS#\n#    SS#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Game Board Analysis\n- **Snake Position**: Head (H) at (4,4). Body (S) segments at (5,4), (5,5), (6,4), (6,5).\n- **Apples**: At (1,2), (1,4), (2,2).\n- **Current Direction**: UP (snake cannot reverse to DOWN).\n- **Goal**: Move toward apples safely to maximize score.\n\n### Possible Directions\n1. **UP**: Next head position is (3,4).  \n   - (3,4) is within bounds (not a wall) and not occupied by the snake’s body.  \n   - This path leads toward the apple at (1,4) (3 steps away: (4,4) → (3,4) → (2,4) → (1,4)).  \n\n2. **LEFT**: Next head position is (4,3).  \n   - (4,3) is safe but leads toward the apple at (2,2) (4 steps away: (4,4) → (4,3) → (4,2) → (3,2) → (2,2)), which is farther than (1,4).  \n\n3. **RIGHT**: Next head position is (4,5).  \n   - (4,5) is safe but leads away from all apples, with no immediate apple in that direction.  \n\n### Conclusion\nMoving UP is optimal as it safely directs the snake toward the nearest apple (at (1,4)) in the fewest steps.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A A #\n#  A   #\n#    H #\n#    S #\n#    SS#\n#     S#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. \n\n### Current State:\n- **Snake Head (H)**: Position (3,4) (row 3, column 4).\n- **Snake Body (S)**: Segments at (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5) (from head to tail).\n- **Current Direction**: UP (snake is moving upward).\n- **Apples (A)**: Positions (1,2), (1,4), (2,2).\n- **Collision Rules**: The snake loses if it hits walls (board edges) or itself.\n\n### Possible Moves (Cannot reverse direction, so DOWN is invalid):\n1. **UP**: Head moves to (2,4) (row 2, column 4).  \n   - (2,4) is empty (no collision).  \n   - Body segments shift: (4,4) → (3,4), (5,4) → (4,4), (5,5) → (5,4), (6,5) → (5,5). Tail (6,5) is removed (no apple eaten).  \n   - Next move (if UP continues) would reach (1,4), which is an apple.  \n\n2. **LEFT**: Head moves to (3,3) (row 3, column 3).  \n   - (3,3) is empty (no collision).  \n   - Body shifts similarly, but this direction does not directly approach any apple quickly.  \n\n3. **RIGHT**: Head moves to (3,5) (row 3, column 5).  \n   - (3,5) is empty (no collision).  \n   - This direction moves away from the nearest apples.  \n\n### Optimal Choice:\nMoving **UP** allows the snake to approach the apple at (1,4) in the next step (epoch 15). Continuing UP would reach (1,4) in epoch 16, eating the apple and growing. This path avoids collisions and strategically targets an apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#  A A #\n#  A H #\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#    SS#\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, we analyze the current state:\n- The snake's head (H) is at (row 2, column 4).\n- Current direction is UP, so possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (cannot reverse to DOWN).\n- The snake's body segments are at (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5).\n\n**Option 1: UP**  \nNext head position: (row 2-1, column 4) = (1,4).  \nRow 1, column 4 is an apple ('A'). Moving UP here will eat the apple, increase the score, and grow the snake. The new head is safe (not a wall or body collision).  \n\n**Option 2: LEFT**  \nNext head position: (row 2, column 4-1) = (2,3).  \nThis is an empty space (no apple), so the snake does not grow. No collision risk, but no score gain.  \n\n**Option 3: RIGHT**  \nNext head position: (row 2, column 4+1) = (2,5).  \nThis is an empty space (no apple), so the snake does not grow. No collision risk, but no score gain.  \n\nThe optimal choice is to move UP to eat the apple and grow the snake.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#  A H #\n#  A S #\n#    S #\n#    S #\n#    SS#\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is currently at position (row 1, column 4) and moving upward ('UP').

Reversing direction to 'DOWN' is not allowed. \n\nAnalyzing possible directions:\n- **LEFT**: Moving left from (1,4) leads to (1,3), which contains an apple ('A'). This is safe (no collision with the snake's body) and would result in eating the apple, increasing the score, and growing the snake.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving right from (1,4) leads to (1,5), which is empty space.

This is safe and positions the snake to potentially reach an apple in the next move.  \n\nThe apples are located at (4,1), (4,4), and (6,1). Moving DOWN to (4,3) places the head in row 4, which contains apples at (4,1) and (4,4). From (4,3), the next move could be RIGHT to (4,4), which is an apple, allowing the snake to eat it and grow.

From (4,2), the next move (if direction remains LEFT) would reach (4,1), which contains an apple. This path directly targets the closest apple.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT is the best choice as it positions the snake to reach the apple at (4,1) in the next move, maximizing the chance to eat an apple and grow.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A SSS #\n#  SSS #\n#   S  #\n#A HS  #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state:\n- **Head position**: (4, 2) (row 4, column 2).\n- **Current direction**: LEFT. The snake cannot reverse to RIGHT.\n- **Possible directions**: LEFT, UP, or DOWN.\n\n### Analysis of each direction:\n1. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (4, 2) takes the head to (4, 1). This position contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple is safe (no collision with walls or the snake's body) and increases the score. This is the best option.\n2. **UP**: Moving UP from (4, 2) takes the head to (3, 2). This position is empty (no apple) and safe, but provides no score gain.\n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (4, 2) takes the head to (5, 2). This position is empty (no apple) and safe, but provides no score gain.\n\nThe optimal choice is to move LEFT to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#A SSS #\n#  SS  #\n#   S  #\n#AHSS  #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is located at (row 4, column 2), and the current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). The possible directions to consider are LEFT, UP, or DOWN.\n\n### Analysis of possible directions:\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (4, 1), which is an apple ('A'). This position is within the board (no wall collision) and not occupied by the snake's body (no self-collision). Eating the apple will grow the snake and increase the score. This is safe and beneficial.\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (3, 2), which is an empty space (no apple). This is safe but does not provide any immediate benefit.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (5, 2), which is an empty space (no apple). This is safe but also does not provide any immediate benefit.\n\nThe optimal choice is to move LEFT, as it allows the snake to eat an apple, grow, and increase the score without risk of collision.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A SSS #\n#  SS  #\n#   S  #\n#HSSS  #\n#      #\n#A   A #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (row 4, column 1) with a current direction of LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so the next direction cannot be RIGHT. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT. \n\n- Moving LEFT would take the head to (row 4, column 0), which is a wall (collision, game over).  \n- Moving UP would take the head to (row 3, column 1), a safe empty space.  \n- Moving DOWN would take the head to (row 5, column 1), also a safe empty space.  \n\nNext, prioritize paths leading to apples. Apples are at (row 1, column 1), (row 6, column 1), and (row 6, column 5). Moving DOWN to (row 5, column 1) allows the snake to then move DOWN again in the next epoch to (row 6, column 1), which is an apple. This path is safe and leads to an apple in the next step.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A SS  #\n#  SS  #\n#   S  #\n#SSSS  #\n#H     #\n#A   A #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (5, 1) (row 5, column 1) and is currently moving DOWN. The next move direction options are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (since UP is the reverse direction and not allowed). \n\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (5, 0), which is a wall ('#'), causing a collision and ending the game. This is invalid.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (5, 2), which is an empty space (' '). No apple is present here, so the snake would not grow, and the score remains unchanged. This is safe but does not gain an apple.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (6, 1). Checking row 6, column 1 is an apple ('A'). Eating this apple will increase the score by 1, grow the snake's length, and the new head position (6, 1) is within the board (no collision with walls or the snake's body). This is safe and beneficial.\n\nThus, the optimal direction is DOWN to eat the apple and grow the snake.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#A SS  #\n#  SS  #\n#   S A#\n#SSSS  #\n#S     #\n#H   A #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (6, 1) (row 6, column 1) with a current direction of DOWN. Moving DOWN would take the head to (7, 1), which is a wall (row 7 is entirely walls), causing a collision and ending the game. The snake cannot reverse direction, so UP (opposite of DOWN) is invalid. Moving LEFT would take the head to (6, 0), which is also a wall (column 0 is a wall), causing a collision. \n\nMoving RIGHT would take the head to (6, 2), which is an empty space (no walls or snake body segments). The snake's body segments are located at (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), and (5,1). None of these positions overlap with (6, 2), so there is no self-collision. This move is safe.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#A S   #\n#  SS  #\n#   S A#\n#SSSS  #\n#S     #\n#SH  A #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The snake's head ('H') is at (row 6, column 2). The body ('S') occupies positions: (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,1), (6,1).\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., cannot go LEFT immediately).\n- **Apples**: Located at (1,1), (3,5), and (6,5).\n- **Walls**: Bound the board edges (row 0 and row 7 are all '#').\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **RIGHT (Current Direction)**:  \n   The next head position is (6,3). Checking (6,3): it is empty (no wall or body collision). This is safe. Continuing RIGHT would allow the snake to move toward the apple at (6,5) (same row, 3 columns to the right). The path to (6,5) is clear (spaces at (6,3) and (6,4)), making this a viable route to an apple.\n\n2. **UP**:  \n   The next head position is (5,2). (5,2) is empty (safe). However, moving UP again would lead to (4,2), which is part of the snake’s body (collision). Alternately, turning RIGHT from (5,2) leads to (5,3), but this path is longer and less direct to any apple compared to moving RIGHT.\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   The next head position is (7,2), which is a wall (collision). This direction is invalid.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT is the safest and most direct path to reach the apple at (6,5) without collision. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#  SS  #\n#   S A#\n#SSSS  #\n#S     #\n#SSH A #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is located at position (6, 4) (row 6, column 4). The current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). We need to check possible directions (RIGHT, UP, DOWN) for safety and apple consumption.\n\n- **RIGHT**: Next position is (6, 5). The cell at (6, 5) contains an apple ('A'). Moving RIGHT here will eat the apple, increase the score by 1, and the snake will grow. The new head position (6, 5) is within the board (no wall collision) and does not collide with the snake's body (since (6, 5) is an apple, not 'S'). This is safe and beneficial.\n\n- **UP**: Next position is (5, 4). The cell at (5, 4) is empty (no apple, no wall, no snake body). Moving UP is safe but does not eat an apple.\n\n- **DOWN**: Next position is (7, 4). Row 7 is a wall ('#'), so moving DOWN causes a wall collision, ending the game. This is invalid.\n\nThe best choice is to continue moving RIGHT to eat the apple and avoid collision. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#   S  #\n#   S A#\n#SSSS  #\n#S     #\n#SSSHA #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (6,4) (row 6, column 4) and is currently moving RIGHT. The next position if moving RIGHT is (6,5), which contains an apple (A). Moving RIGHT is valid because it does not reverse the current direction (LEFT is the only reverse direction, which is forbidden), and (6,5) is within the board (not a wall) and not occupied by the snake's body. Eating the apple will increase the score and allow the snake to grow. \n\nOther possible directions:\n- UP: Would move the head to (5,4), which is empty (no apple) but safe. However, it does not contribute to eating an apple.\n- DOWN: Would move the head to (7,4), which is a wall (row 7 is the bottom wall), causing a collision and ending the game.\n- LEFT: Reverse of the current direction (RIGHT), which is forbidden.\n\nThus, the best choice is to continue moving RIGHT to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n# A S  #\n#   S A#\n#SSSS  #\n#S     #\n#SSSSH #\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (6,5) (row 6, column 5) and is currently moving RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (6,5) would take the head to (7,5), which is a wall (row 7 is all '#'). This causes a collision, so DOWN is invalid.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (6,5) leads to (6,6), which is empty (no walls or body segments). This is a valid move but does not lead to an apple.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP from (6,5) leads to (5,5), which is empty (no walls or body segments). This is a valid move and positions the snake to move toward the apple at (3,5) in subsequent steps (since (3,5) is in the same column, moving UP again would approach it).  \n\nChoosing UP allows the snake to avoid immediate danger and head toward an apple, making it the optimal direction.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#A     #\n# A    #\n#   S A#\n#SSSS  #\n#S   H #\n#SSSSS #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is currently at position (5,4) (row 5, column 4). The current direction is UP. Moving UP would take the head to (4,4), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'), causing a self-collision. The snake cannot reverse direction, so moving DOWN is invalid. This leaves LEFT and RIGHT as possible directions.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (5,3), which is empty (safe). However, subsequent moves in this direction may lead to collisions with the body (e.g., moving UP from (5,3) would reach (4,3), which is 'S').  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (5,5), which is empty (safe). From (5,5), the snake can then move UP to (4,5) (safe) and then UP again to (3,5), where an apple ('A') is located. This path avoids collisions and leads toward an apple.  \n\nThus, the safest and most strategic direction is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#A     #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n#SSSS  #\n#S   SH#\n#SSSSS #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 5, column 6).  \n2. **Current Direction**: RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid).  \n3. **Collision Checks**:  \n   - **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (5,6) leads to (5,7), which is a wall ('#'). Collision.  \n   - **UP**: Moving UP from (5,6) leads to (4,6). This cell is empty (no wall or snake body). Safe.  \n   - **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (5,6) leads to (6,6). This cell is empty (no wall or snake body). Safe.  \n\n4. **Apple Strategy**: The apples are at (1,1), (2,2), and (3,6). The closest apple is at (3,6) (2 rows above the head).  \n   - If the snake moves UP to (4,6), the next direction can remain UP, leading to (3,6) (the apple) in the next move. This allows the snake to eat the apple and grow.  \n   - Moving DOWN to (6,6) leads to a dead end: subsequent moves (DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT) would hit walls or the snake’s own body.  \n\nThus, the safest and most strategic direction is UP.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#A     #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n#SSS  H#\n#S   SS#\n#SSSSS #\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is located at row 4, column 6 (0-indexed). The current direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse to DOWN. The possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to row 3, column 6. Checking this position on the board, row 3, column 6 contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple is safe (no collision with walls or the snake's body) and will increase the score by 1.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to row 4, column 5, which is an empty space. This avoids collision but does not eat an apple.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to row 4, column 7, which is a wall ('#'). This would cause a collision and end the game.  \n\nThe optimal choice is to move UP to eat the apple and grow the snake. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n# A    #\n#     H#\n#SSSA S#\n#S   SS#\n#SSSSS #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and collision risks:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 3, column 6).\n- **Current Direction**: UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid).\n- **Possible Directions**: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (RIGHT leads to a wall at column 7, so only UP and LEFT are valid).\n- **Apples**: Located at (1,1), (2,2), and (4,4).\n\n### Analysis of Valid Moves:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (row 2, column 6). This position is empty (no walls or body segments), so it is safe. This direction allows the snake to approach the apple at (2,2) in subsequent moves (by turning LEFT later).\n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (row 3, column 5). This position is also empty and safe. However, continuing LEFT would eventually lead to a wall (column 0) without reaching an apple quickly.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP is optimal because it keeps the snake on a path toward the apple at (2,2) while avoiding immediate collisions.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n# A   H#\n#     S#\n#SS A S#\n#S   SS#\n#SSSSS #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. The snake's head is at (row 2, column 5), moving UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid), leaving UP, LEFT, or RIGHT as options.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (1,1), (2,2), and (4,4).\n2. **Collision Check**:\n   - **UP**: New head position (1,5) is empty (no wall\/body), safe but no apple.\n   - **LEFT**: New head position (2,4) is empty (no wall\/body), safe and moves toward the apple at (2,2).\n   - **RIGHT**: New head position (2,6) is empty (no wall\/body), safe but does not directly approach any apple.\n\n### Strategy:\nThe closest apple is at (2,2). Moving LEFT from the current head (2,5) leads to (2,4), then subsequent LEFT moves will reach (2,3) and (2,2) (the apple) in the next two epochs. This path avoids walls and self-collision while directly targeting an apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n# A  HS#\n#     S#\n#S  A S#\n#S   SS#\n#SSSSS #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (2,4) (row 2, column 4), and the current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid), leaving possible directions: LEFT, UP, or DOWN. \n\n### Analysis of possible moves:\n1. **LEFT**: Moving left from (2,4) leads to (2,3). This cell is empty (no wall or self-collision). The next move (if LEFT is chosen again) would reach (2,2), which contains an apple ('A'). This path safely leads to an apple in the next step.\n2. **UP**: Moving up from (2,4) leads to (1,4). This cell is empty, but the next move upward would hit a wall (row 0 is all walls). Moving left\/right from (1,4) would require more steps to reach the nearest apple (at (1,1)), making this path less efficient.\n3. **DOWN**: Moving down from (2,4) leads to (3,4). This cell is empty, and the next move downward would reach (4,4), which contains an apple ('A'). However, this path is equally valid but requires the same number of steps as the LEFT path.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth LEFT and DOWN paths can reach an apple in the next step. However, since the snake is already moving LEFT, continuing in this direction aligns with the current momentum and directly targets the nearest apple at (2,2). \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n# A HSS#\n#     S#\n#   A S#\n#S   SS#\n#SSSSS #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state:\n- The snake's head (H) is at position (row 2, column 3).\n- Current direction: LEFT (snake cannot reverse to RIGHT).\n- Possible directions: UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\n### Analysis of each possible direction:\n1. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (2, 2). Checking (2, 2) on the board: it contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple will increase the score by 1 and grow the snake. The new head position (2, 2) is not a wall or part of the snake's body, so this is safe.\n2. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (1, 3). This position is empty (no apple, no collision), but it does not contribute to eating an apple.\n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (3, 3). This position is also empty (no apple, no collision), but again, no apple is eaten.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple, which is the highest priority for maximizing the score.

Valid directions from LEFT are LEFT, UP, or DOWN.\n\n### Evaluation of Possible Directions:\n1. **LEFT**:  \n   The head moves to (2,1). This position is empty (no wall or body collision). From (2,1), the next move can be UP to reach the apple at (1,1) in the next epoch. This path is safe and directly targets the nearest apple.\n\n2. **UP**:  \n   The head moves to (1,2).

However, this path requires an extra turn compared to moving LEFT first.\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   The head moves to (3,2). This position is empty, but it does not directly approach either apple. Reaching the apple at (4,3) would require more steps, making this less optimal.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT is the best choice, as it positions the snake to reach the nearest apple (1,1) in the next epoch with minimal turns.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#A     #\n# HSSSS#\n#     S#\n#   A S#\n# A  SS#\n#SSSSS #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (2,1) (row 2, column 1), and the current direction is LEFT.

This is empty (no apple) and safe (no collision with walls or body). However, no apple is eaten.\n2. **UP**: Next position is (Row 4, Column 2). This is empty (no apple) and safe. No apple is eaten.\n3. **DOWN**: Next position is (Row 6, Column 2). This square contains an 'A' (apple). Moving DOWN is allowed (not reversing direction) and safe (no collision with walls or body). Eating this apple increases the score and grows the snake.\n\n**Best Move**: DOWN, as it safely eats an apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SS  A #\n#SSSSSS#\n#SA   S#\n#S  A S#\n#SS  SS#\n# H    #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (6, 2) (row 6, column 2), and the current direction is DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction, so the next direction cannot be UP. Possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. \n\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (6, 2) would take the head to (7, 2), which is a wall (row 7 is all '#'). This causes a collision, ending the game. Thus, DOWN is invalid.\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (6, 2) takes the head to (6, 1). This is a safe space (no wall or body). However, the next move (if direction is UP) would lead to (5, 1), which is part of the snake's body (row 5, column 1 is 'S'), causing a collision. Thus, LEFT is risky.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (6, 2) takes the head to (6, 3). This is a safe space. From (6, 3), the snake can then move UP to (5, 3) (safe), UP again to (4, 3) (safe), and then RIGHT to (4, 4), which contains an apple ('A').

The snake's head ('H') is at (row 6, column 3), and the current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid), and moving DOWN would collide with the wall (row 7 is all '#'), leaving UP and RIGHT as valid options.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Apple Locations**: There are 3 apples at (1,5), (3,2), and (4,4). The closest and most accessible apple is at (4,4) (row 4, column 4).\n2. **Snake Safety**: \n   - **Moving RIGHT**: The head would move to (6,4), which is empty. This is safe but keeps the head in row 6, increasing the row distance to the apple at (4,4).\n   - **Moving UP**: The head would move to (5,3), which is empty. This reduces the row distance to the apple (from 6 → 5, bringing it closer to row 4 where the apple is).\n\n### Path to the Apple at (4,4):\n- If the snake moves UP (to (5,3)), subsequent UP moves (to (4,3)) and a RIGHT move (to (4,4)) would reach the apple in 3 steps. This path avoids the snake’s body (S’s are concentrated in the upper rows but not in (5,3) or (4,3)).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP brings the snake closer to the nearest apple (4,4) while avoiding collisions with walls or its own body. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#SS  A #\n#SSSSSS#\n#SA   S#\n#S  A S#\n#SSH   #\n# SS   #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 5, column 3) (row 5: \"#SSH   #\", column 3).\n- **Current Direction**: UP.

This is a safe, empty cell but moves the snake away from the nearest apple (3,2), making it less optimal.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT allows the snake to position itself to reach the apple at (3,2) in the next move, avoiding potential collisions and maximizing progress.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SS  A #\n#SSSSSS#\n#SA    #\n#SHSA  #\n#SSS   #\n# SS   #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (row 4, column 2).

However, (4,3) is occupied by the snake's body ('S'), causing a self-collision. This is invalid.  \n2. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (5,4). (5,4) is empty (space), so no collision.

The head is at (4,5), with no immediate body collisions in the intended movement directions.\n2. **Apple Locations**: Apples (A) are at (1,4), (1,5), and (5,6). The closest apple is at (5,6) (row 5, column 6), which is down-right of the head.\n3. **Movement Analysis**:\n   - **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (4,6) (a safe, empty space). From (4,6), the next move DOWN would reach (5,6) (the apple), allowing the snake to eat it in the subsequent step.\n   - **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (5,5) (a safe, empty space).

Additionally, the next move (if directed RIGHT) would reach the apple at (5, 6) in the following epoch, allowing the snake to eat the apple and grow.\n\nBetween the two options, moving DOWN is optimal because it positions the snake to reach an apple in the next step, maximizing the score.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SS AA #\n#SS  A #\n#SSSS  #\n#SSSSSS#\n#SSS  H#\n# SS   #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (row 5, column 6).

This causes a collision, so RIGHT is invalid.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (6, 6), which is empty (safe). However, the next move (epoch 60) in the same direction (DOWN) would take the head to (7, 6), a wall, leading to a collision.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (5, 5), which is empty (safe). This avoids immediate wall collision and provides more flexibility to navigate away from the bottom wall in future steps.  \n\nGiven that moving DOWN risks a wall collision in the next epoch, while moving LEFT is safe and avoids this immediate danger, the optimal choice is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SS AA #\n#S   A #\n#SSSS  #\n#SSSSSS#\n#SSS HS#\n# SS   #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is located at row 5, column 5.

The snake has a length of 1 (no body segments yet), so no self-collision risk.\n2. **Current Direction**: The snake is moving RIGHT. Reversing direction (LEFT) is invalid.\n3. **Apples**: Three apples are present at (1,1), (3,2), and (4,6).\n4. **Safety Check**: \n   - Moving RIGHT: Next position is (4,5), which is empty (safe, no wall\/body collision).\n   - Moving UP: Next position is (3,4), which is empty (safe).\n   - Moving DOWN: Next position is (5,4), which is empty (safe).\n   - Moving LEFT: Invalid (reverse of current direction).\n\n5. **Apple Proximity**: The closest apple is at (4,6), directly to the RIGHT of the head (two steps away: (4,5) → (4,6)). Continuing RIGHT allows the snake to reach this apple in the next move (epoch 3: (4,5); epoch 4: (4,6), where it will eat the apple). Other apples are farther (e.g., (3,2) requires moving UP then LEFT, (1,1) requires moving UP multiple times and LEFT).\n\nThus, the safest and most efficient direction to eat an apple quickly is to continue moving RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#    HA#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving RIGHT, and the head is at position (4,4). The next possible directions are UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT (since reversing to LEFT is not allowed). \n\n- Moving RIGHT: The head will move to (4,5), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple will increase the score by 1, and the snake will grow in length (the previous head position (4,4) will become part of the body 'S'). This move is safe as (4,5) is within the board and no collision occurs.\n- Moving UP: The head will move to (3,4), which is empty. No apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow.\n- Moving DOWN: The head will move to (5,4), which is empty. No apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow.\n\nThe optimal move is to continue RIGHT to eat the apple and grow the snake. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#AA    #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#    SH#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The snake's head ('H') is at (row 4, column 5), and the body ('S') is at (row 4, column 4). The current direction is RIGHT.\n- **Apples**: Apples ('A') are located at (row 1, column 1), (row 1, column 2), and (row 3, column 2).\n- **Movement Constraints**: The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., RIGHT → LEFT is invalid). Valid directions from RIGHT are UP, DOWN, or continuing RIGHT.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Moves:\n1. **Continue RIGHT**: The head would move to (row 4, column 6), which is empty. No apple is eaten here. This path does not directly lead toward the nearest apple (row 3, column 2).\n2. **Turn DOWN**: The head would move to (row 5, column 5), which is empty. This direction moves the snake away from all apples, making it suboptimal.\n3. **Turn UP**: The head would move to (row 3, column 5), which is empty. From here, the snake can then turn LEFT (valid, as UP → LEFT is not a reversal) to approach the nearest apple at (row 3, column 2). This path aligns with reaching the closest apple efficiently.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTurning UP allows the snake to position itself to move toward the nearest apple (row 3, column 2) in subsequent steps. This is the most strategic choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#AA    #\n#      #\n# A   H#\n#     S#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's position, current direction (UP), and apple locations. The snake's head (H) is at (3,5) (row 3, column 5), with a body segment (S) at (4,5). Apples (A) are at (1,1), (1,2), and (3,1). The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid), leaving UP, LEFT, or RIGHT as options.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **UP Direction**: Moving UP would take the head to (2,5), an empty cell. This avoids collision but does not lead toward apples quickly. Reaching apples in row 1 would require additional upward and leftward moves, taking more steps.\n   \n2. **RIGHT Direction**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (3,6), an empty cell. This direction moves away from all apples, making it suboptimal.\n\n3. **LEFT Direction**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (3,4), an empty cell. Continuing LEFT would sequentially move the head to (3,3), (3,2), and (3,1) (an apple). This path directly targets the nearest apple at (3,1) in 4 steps (epochs 6–9), avoiding walls and self-collision.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT is the best direction, as it leads the snake toward the closest apple efficiently without risk of collision.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#AA    #\n#      #\n# A  HS#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (3, 5), and its body (S) is at (3, 6). The current direction is LEFT, and the snake cannot reverse to RIGHT. To maximize apple consumption, we analyze possible moves:\n\n- **LEFT**: The head moves to (3, 4) (empty space). This direction keeps the snake on a path toward the apple at (3, 1) (same row, further left). Continuing LEFT in subsequent moves will lead the snake to the apple at (3, 1) in a few steps, avoiding walls and self-collision.\n- **UP**: The head moves to (2, 5) (empty space). This direction moves the snake away from the nearest apple in row 3, reducing the chance of quickly reaching an apple.\n- **DOWN**: The head moves to (4, 5) (empty space). This direction also moves the snake away from the apples in row 1 and 3, making it less optimal.\n\nThe best choice is to continue moving LEFT to approach the apple at (3, 1) safely.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#AA    #\n#      #\n# A HS #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (3,4) (row 3, column 4), and the body (S) is at (3,5). The current direction is LEFT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). The possible directions to choose are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. \n\n### Analysis of possible directions:\n1. **LEFT (current direction):**  \n   Moving LEFT will take the head from (3,4) to (3,3) (a space, no collision). This is safe. After this move, the next direction can remain LEFT, leading the head to (3,2) in the following epoch, which is an apple ('A'). Eating this apple will grow the snake and increase the score.  \n\n2. **UP:**  \n   Moving UP takes the head to (2,4) (a space, safe). However, continuing UP would eventually reach row 0 (a wall), and adjusting direction to reach apples in row 1 (positions (1,1) and (1,2)) would require more steps, delaying apple consumption.  \n\n3. **DOWN:**  \n   Moving DOWN takes the head to (4,4) (a space, safe). However, continuing DOWN would eventually reach row 7 (a wall), and apples are not in this direction, making this path less optimal.  \n\nThe most direct path to an apple is continuing LEFT, as it leads to the apple at (3,2) in the next two epochs.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#AA    #\n#      #\n# AHS  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (row 3, column 3), with its body (S) at (row 3, column 4). The current direction is LEFT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). \n\nAnalyzing possible moves:\n- **LEFT (current direction)**: The next position for the head would be (row 3, column 2), which contains an apple ('A'). Moving LEFT here allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score by 1 and growing the snake's length. This is safe and beneficial.\n- **UP**: The next position would be (row 2, column 3), which is empty. No apple is eaten, and the snake's length remains unchanged.\n- **DOWN**: The next position would be (row 4, column 3), which is empty. No apple is eaten, and the snake's length remains unchanged.\n- **RIGHT**: Reversing direction is not allowed, so this is invalid.\n\nThe optimal move is to continue moving LEFT to eat the apple. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#AA    #\n#      #\n# HSS  #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (3, 2) (row 3, column 2) and is currently moving LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so the next direction cannot be RIGHT. Possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT. \n\n### Analysis of each possible direction:\n1. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (3, 1). This cell is empty (no apple, no collision). The snake would not eat an apple here, and the next move would need to navigate toward apples, which are farther away.  \n2. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (4, 2). This cell is empty (no apple, no collision). The nearest apple in this direction is at (5, 3), requiring multiple additional moves to reach.  \n3. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (2, 2). This cell is empty (no collision). From (2, 2), the next move (if continuing UP) would reach (1, 2), which contains an apple. This path allows the snake to eat an apple in the next epoch, maximizing score growth.  \n\nMoving UP is the optimal choice as it directly leads toward an apple in the fewest steps without risk of collision.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#AA    #\n# H    #\n# SS   #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (row 2, column 2), moving in the UP direction. The snake's body segments are at (row 3, column 2) and (row 3, column 3). The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). \n\nAnalyzing possible moves:\n- **UP**: The head moves to (row 1, column 2), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score and grows the snake. This position is within the board (no wall collision) and does not overlap with the snake's body (safe).\n- **LEFT**: The head moves to (row 2, column 1), an empty space. No apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow.\n- **RIGHT**: The head moves to (row 2, column 3), an empty space. No apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow.\n- **DOWN**: Reverses the current direction (UP → DOWN), which is invalid.\n\nThe optimal move is to continue moving UP to eat the apple, maximizing the score. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#AH    #\n# S    #\n# SS  A#\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (row 1, column 2). The current direction is UP, so the snake cannot reverse to DOWN. Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (row 0, column 2), which is a wall (#). This causes a collision, ending the game. Invalid.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (row 1, column 1), which contains an apple (A). Eating the apple is safe (no collision with walls or the snake's body), increases the score, and allows the snake to grow. Valid.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (row 1, column 3), an empty space. No apple is eaten, but the move is safe. However, it does not improve the score.  \n\nThe optimal choice is to move LEFT to eat the apple.  \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#HS    #\n# S    #\n# SS  A#\n#     A#\n#  A   #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (1,1), and the current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so it cannot choose RIGHT. \n\n- Moving LEFT from (1,1) would take the head to (1,0), which is a wall (collision).\n- Moving UP from (1,1) would take the head to (0,1), which is a wall (collision).\n- Moving DOWN from (1,1) would take the head to (2,1), which is empty (no wall or self-collision).\n\nThus, the only safe direction to avoid immediate collision is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SS    #\n#HS    #\n# S   A#\n#     A#\n#  A   #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (2,1) (row 2, column 1) and is currently moving DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction, so the next direction cannot be UP. Let's analyze possible directions:\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving left would take the head to (2,0), which is a wall ('#'). This causes a collision with the wall, ending the game.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving right would take the head to (2,2), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This causes a self-collision, ending the game.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving down takes the head to (3,1). Checking row 3, column 1 is empty (' '), so no collision. This is safe and allows the snake to continue.  \n\nThe only valid direction to avoid collision is DOWN.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SS    #\n#SS    #\n#H    A#\n#     A#\n#  A   #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (3, 1) (row 3, column 1), and it is currently moving DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction (so UP is invalid). The valid directions to consider are DOWN, RIGHT, and LEFT (but LEFT leads to a wall collision). \n\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (3, 0), which is a wall (#). This causes an immediate collision, so LEFT is invalid.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (4, 1). This position is empty (no wall or body collision). No apple is present here, so the snake does not grow.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (3, 2). This position is empty (no wall or body collision). No apple is present here, so the snake does not grow.  \n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT are safe, but the goal is to eat apples. The apples are at (3, 6), (4, 6), and (5, 3). Moving RIGHT aligns the snake with the apple at (3, 6) in the same row, providing a straightforward path to reach it in fewer steps compared to other directions. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SS    #\n#S     #\n#SH   A#\n#     A#\n#  A   #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. The snake's head ('H') is at (row 3, column 2), moving RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid), leaving UP, DOWN, or RIGHT as options. We need to prioritize safe moves that lead to apples.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Apple Positions**: Apples ('A') are at (3,6), (4,5), and (5,3).\n2. **Snake Body**: The snake's body ('S') is at (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,1). No immediate collisions are expected in the tested directions.\n3. **Direction Analysis**:\n   - **RIGHT**: Next head position is (3,3) (safe, empty). This path leads to Apple (3,6) in 4 steps (RIGHT ×4).\n   - **UP**: Next head position is (2,2) (safe, empty). However, a subsequent UP move would reach (1,2), which is part of the snake's body (collision risk).\n   - **DOWN**: Next head position is (4,2) (safe, empty). This path leads to Apple (5,3) in 3 steps (DOWN ×2, then RIGHT). This is the shortest path to an apple.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN is safe and allows the snake to reach the closest apple (5,3) in 3 steps, maximizing apple consumption.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#SS   A#\n# H   A#\n#  A   #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: Head 'H' is at (4,2) (row 4, column 2).

Valid directions: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n- **Apples**: Located at (3,6), (4,6), and (5,3).\n- **Goal**: Move safely to eat apples without colliding with walls or the snake's body.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Moves:\n1. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (4,2) leads to (4,1). This position is empty and safe. However, further LEFT would reach (4,0) (a wall), risking collision. This path is less favorable.\n   \n2. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (4,2) leads to (4,3). This position is empty and safe. While this could eventually reach the apple at (4,6), it requires more steps (4 moves) compared to other options.\n\n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (4,2) leads to (5,2). This position is empty and safe. From (5,2), a subsequent RIGHT move would reach the apple at (5,3) in the next step, allowing the snake to eat the apple quickly (only 2 moves total).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN is optimal as it positions the snake to reach the nearest apple (at (5,3)) in the next move, avoiding immediate risks and maximizing progress.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#S     #\n#SS   A#\n# S   A#\n# HA   #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 5, column 2).  \n2. **Current Direction**: The snake is moving DOWN.

We evaluate each:\n\n1. **RIGHT**: Head moves to (5,4) (empty, safe). Next steps would require moving up to reach apples, but this path is longer.\n2. **DOWN**: Head moves to (6,3) (empty, safe). This moves the snake away from apples, delaying apple consumption.\n3. **UP**: Head moves to (4,3) (empty, safe).

The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid).\n- **Apples**: Located at (row 1, column 1), (row 1, column 2), and (row 6, column 4).\n- **Collision Risks**: The snake loses if it hits walls (edge '#') or its own body ('S').\n\n### Possible Moves:\n1. **LEFT (Current Direction)**:  \n   The head moves to (row 3, column 3). This position is empty (no wall or body), so it is safe. No apple is present here, so the snake does not grow.  \n\n2. **UP**:  \n   The head moves to (row 2, column 4). This position is empty (no wall or body), so it is safe. No apple is present here, but this move brings the snake closer to the apples in row 1.  \n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   The head would move to (row 4, column 4), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This causes a collision, so DOWN is invalid.  \n\n4. **RIGHT**:  \n   Reverse of the current direction (LEFT), which is not allowed. RIGHT is invalid.  \n\n### Optimal Choice:\nBoth LEFT and UP are safe, but UP is preferable because it positions the snake closer to the apples in row 1 (columns 1 and 2), increasing the likelihood of eating an apple in subsequent moves.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#AA    #\n#   H  #\n#   SSS#\n#  SSSS#\n# SS   #\n#    A #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (2,3) (row 2, column 3), and it is currently moving UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). The possible directions to choose are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (1,3). This position is a safe empty space (not a wall or part of the snake's body). This move keeps the snake moving toward the apples in row 1 (columns 1 and 2), which are nearby.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (2,2), a safe empty space. However, this moves the snake away from the closest apples in row 1.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (2,4), a safe empty space, but this also moves the snake away from the nearest apples.  \n\nContinuing UP is optimal because it positions the snake to reach the apples in row 1 (e.g., (1,2)) in the next move, maximizing the chance to eat an apple and grow. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#AA H  #\n#   S  #\n#   SSS#\n#  SSSS#\n#  S   #\n#    A #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is currently at position (1, 3) (row 1, column 3). The current direction is UP. The snake cannot reverse direction, so it cannot turn to DOWN. Moving UP would take the head to (0, 3), which is a wall (row 0 is all '#'), resulting in a collision and game over. \n\nPossible valid directions are LEFT or RIGHT. \n\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (1, 2), which is an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score by 1, and the snake grows. The new head position (1, 2) is not occupied by the snake's body (S), so no collision occurs.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (1, 4), which is empty (' '). This is safe but does not eat an apple.  \n\nSince LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple (optimal for scoring) without collision, it is the best choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#AAHS  #\n#   S  #\n#   SSS#\n#  SSSS#\n#      #\n#    A #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (1, 3) (row 1, column 3), and the current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so possible directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (0, 3), which is a wall (row 0 is all '#'). This would cause a collision and end the game.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (2, 3). This position is empty (no wall or body), but there is no apple here, so the snake would not gain length or score.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (1, 2). This position contains an apple ('A'). Since (1, 2) is not a wall or part of the snake's body (S), this move is safe. Eating the apple would increase the score by 1 and allow the snake to grow.  \n\nThe optimal choice is to move LEFT to eat the apple and avoid collision. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#AHSS A#\n#   S  #\n#   SSS#\n#  SSSS#\n#      #\n#    A #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current state:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 1, column 2).\n- **Current Direction**: LEFT (snake cannot reverse to RIGHT).\n- **Possible Directions**: UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since reversing to RIGHT is invalid).\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP from (1,2) would take the head to (0,2), which is a wall (row 0 is all '#'). This causes a collision and game over. **Invalid**.\n2. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (1,2) would take the head to (2,2). This position is empty (no apple, no body, no wall). While safe, it does not eat an apple. **Safe but no score gain**.\n3. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (1,2) would take the head to (1,1). This position contains an apple ('A'). The cell (1,1) is within the board (not a wall) and not part of the snake’s body (body segments are at (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)). Eating the apple increases the score by 1 and safely grows the snake. **Safe and score-positive**.\n\nThe best choice is to move LEFT, as it safely eats an apple and avoids collisions.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#HSSS A#\n#  AS  #\n#   SSS#\n#  SSSS#\n#      #\n#    A #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT. The head (H) is at position (1,1) (row 1, column 1). \n\n- Moving LEFT would take the head to (1,0), which is a wall (column 0 is a wall), causing a collision and game over.  \n- Moving UP would take the head to (0,1), which is a wall (row 0 is a wall), causing a collision and game over.  \n- Moving RIGHT is the reverse of the current direction (LEFT → RIGHT is a direct reversal), which is not allowed.  \n- Moving DOWN would take the head to (2,1). Checking (2,1) on the board: row 2 is \"#  AS  #\", so column 1 in row 2 is an empty space (' '), not a wall or part of the snake's body (the snake's body is at positions (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)).

Reversing direction (to UP) is invalid.  \n3. **Possible Directions**: LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (UP is reversed and forbidden).  \n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (2,1) leads to (2,0), which is a wall ('#'). This causes a collision, ending the game. **Invalid**.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (2,1) leads to (3,1). This cell is empty (no apple or body). The snake moves safely but does not eat an apple.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (2,1) leads to (2,2). This cell is empty (no collision). Notably, the next position (2,3) in row 2 contains an apple ('A'). If the snake continues moving RIGHT in subsequent steps, it can eat this apple, increasing the score.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT avoids immediate collision, sets up a path to an apple, and is the safest and most strategic choice.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#SSSS A#\n#SHAS  #\n#   SSS#\n#    SS#\n#      #\n#    A #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is located at row 2, column 2 (0-indexed).  \n2. **Current Direction**: RIGHT (snake cannot reverse to LEFT).  \n3. **Possible Moves**: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.  \n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n- **UP**: Next head position would be row 1, column 2. This position is occupied by 'S' (snake's body), causing a self-collision. **Invalid**.  \n- **DOWN**: Next head position would be row 3, column 2.

The apple at (5,3) is directly below (4,3), which is the next position if moving DOWN.\n\n### Strategy:\nMoving DOWN to (4,3) is safe and positions the snake to reach the apple at (5,3) in the next move (by continuing DOWN).

The goal is to choose a direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) that avoids collisions and maximizes apple consumption. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Current Direction Restriction**: The snake cannot reverse direction, so UP (opposite of DOWN) is invalid. Valid options: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n2. **Collision Check**: \n   - Moving DOWN: Head moves to (6, 2), which is empty (safe, no wall\/body collision).\n   - Moving LEFT: Head moves to (5, 1), which is empty (safe, no wall\/body collision).\n   - Moving RIGHT: Head moves to (5, 3), which is empty (safe, no wall\/body collision).\n3. **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (1, 6), (4, 1), and (6, 4). The closest apple is at (4, 1) (Manhattan distance 2 from the head).\n\n### Strategy:\nThe apple at (4, 1) is the closest. To reach it:\n- Moving LEFT (to (5, 1)) positions the head to then move UP (next step) to (4, 1), where the apple is located.

Moving RIGHT would take the head to (5, 2), which is part of the snake's body (collision, game over). \n\nThe remaining options are UP and DOWN. Moving UP takes the head to (4, 1), which contains an apple ('A'). This is safe (no collision) and allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score and growing in length.

To avoid collision, the snake would need to turn UP from (3,4) to (2,4) (safe) and then UP to (1,4) (apple). While possible, this path requires an extra turn compared to moving UP directly.\n\n3. **RIGHT**: The next head position would be (3,6) (row 3, column 6). This position is empty (safe). From (3,6), moving UP to (2,6) (safe) and then UP to (1,6) (an apple at row 1, column 6) is also a valid path. However, this path is symmetric to the UP path but requires adjusting direction to RIGHT first.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP is the most straightforward and safe option, as it aligns with the current direction and allows the snake to progress toward the nearest apple at (1,4) without unnecessary turns. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#A  A A#\n#  S  H#\n#  S  S#\n#SSS  S#\n#SSS SS#\n#SSSSS #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (2,6) (row 2, column 6).

Checking row 1, column 6 is an apple ('A'), so the snake would eat the apple, grow in length, and increase the score. This position is not a wall or a body part (S), so it is safe.  \n- **Moving LEFT**: The head would move to (2,5), which is a space (no apple, no collision). This is safe but does not eat an apple.  \n- **Moving RIGHT**: The head would move to (2,7), which is a wall ('#'), causing a collision and ending the game.

This is a space (no wall or body collision). Moving left here is safe.  \n   *Future Potential*: From (1,3), the next left move (to (1,2)) will reach an apple ('A' at (1,2)), allowing the snake to grow and increase the score.\n\n2. **UP**:  \n   Next head position: (0, 4). Row 0 is a wall → collision. Invalid.\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   Next head position: (2, 4). This is a space (no collision). However, moving down leads to (2,4) → (3,4) → (4,4) → (5,4) → (6,4) (which is a body segment at (6,4)). This path risks future collisions and does not immediately reach an apple.\n\n4. **RIGHT**:  \n   Reversing direction is forbidden.

The snake's head is at position (4, 3) (row 4, column 3). Moving UP from the current position will take the head to (3, 3), which is occupied by an apple ('A'). Since the snake cannot reverse direction (UP to DOWN is not allowed), valid directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\nMoving UP is safe: (3, 3) is within the board (no wall collision) and contains an apple. Eating the apple will increase the score by 1 and grow the snake. Moving LEFT or RIGHT would lead to empty cells without apples, missing the opportunity to eat. Thus, the optimal direction is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# AH   #\n#  S   #\n#  AA  #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n- **Snake Head (H)**: Position (row 3, column 3).\n- **Snake Body (S)**: Position (row 4, column 3).\n- **Current Direction**: UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., cannot turn to DOWN).\n- **Apples (A)**: Located at (row 3, column 2), (row 5, column 3), and (row 5, column 4).\n\n### Possible Directions (non-reversing):\n1. **UP**: Moving up would take the head to (row 2, column 3), which is empty (no apple). No score gain.\n2. **LEFT**: Moving left would take the head to (row 3, column 2), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1 and grows the snake. The new head position is safe (no wall or self-collision).\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving right would take the head to (row 3, column 4), which is empty (no apple). No score gain.\n\n**LEFT** is optimal because it allows the snake to eat an apple, increasing the score and length, with no risk of collision.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   A  #\n#      #\n# HS   #\n#  S   #\n#  AA  #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (3, 2) (row 3, column 2). The current direction is LEFT, and the snake cannot reverse to RIGHT. Allowed directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN. \n\nApples ('A') are located at (1, 3), (5, 2), and (5, 3). The goal is to move toward an apple safely. \n\n- Moving LEFT (current direction) would take the head to (3, 1), which is empty but not near an apple.  \n- Moving UP would take the head to (2, 2), also empty and not near an apple.  \n- Moving DOWN would take the head to (4, 2). From (4, 2), the next move in the DOWN direction would reach (5, 2), which is an apple. This path allows the snake to eat an apple in the next epoch.  \n\nThus, moving DOWN is optimal. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   A  #\n#      #\n# SS   #\n# H    #\n#  AA  #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. The snake's head is at (4,2) (row 4, column 2), moving DOWN. The body segments are at (3,2) and (3,3). Apples are at (1,3), (5,3), and (5,4). The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., cannot turn UP from DOWN).\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **DOWN (Current Direction)**:  \n   The head would move to (5,2) (row 5, column 2). This cell is empty (safe, no collision with walls or body). After moving, the snake's new segments would be: head at (5,2), body at (4,2) and (3,2). This positions the snake to move RIGHT in the next epoch, targeting the apple at (5,3).\n\n2. **LEFT**:  \n   The head would move to (4,1) (row 4, column 1). This cell is empty (safe), but it moves the snake away from the nearest apples (row 5, columns 3-4), reducing the chance of quickly eating an apple.\n\n3. **RIGHT**:  \n   The head would move to (4,3) (row 4, column 3). This cell is empty (safe), but it also does not directly target the nearest apples as effectively as continuing DOWN.\n\n### Optimal Choice:\nContinuing DOWN is the best option. It keeps the snake moving toward the cluster of apples in row 5 (columns 3-4) and positions it to eat an apple in the next epoch by turning RIGHT. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   A  #\n#      #\n# S    #\n# S    #\n# HAA  #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN.

Possible directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continuing DOWN. \n\n- Moving DOWN: New head position would be (row 6, column 2), which is empty (no apple, no collision). \n- Moving LEFT: New head position would be (row 5, column 1), which is empty (no apple, no collision). \n- Moving RIGHT: New head position would be (row 5, column 3), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple will increase the score by 1 and grow the snake. \n\nChoosing RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple, which is optimal. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#   A  #\n#      #\n# S    #\n# SA   #\n# SHA  #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT.

This cell is empty (no apple, no collision with walls\/body). The snake moves safely but gains no score.\n\n2. **UP**:  \n   The head would move to (4,3). This cell is empty (no apple, no collision with walls\/body). The snake moves safely but gains no score.\n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   The head would move to (6,3), which contains an apple ('A'). This position is valid (no wall collision, and (6,3) is not part of the snake’s body). Eating the apple increases the score by 1 and allows the snake to grow in length.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN allows the snake to eat an apple, increasing the score and growing the snake. This is the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n# S    #\n# SA   #\n# SSS  #\n#   H  #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (6, 3) (row 6, column 3). The current direction is DOWN, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so UP is invalid). Moving DOWN would lead to a wall (row 7, column 3), causing a collision. Thus, the valid directions are LEFT or RIGHT.\n\n### Analysis of LEFT:\n- Moving LEFT would take the head to (6, 2) (empty space, no collision). However, the next possible moves (UP, DOWN, or LEFT) are risky:\n  - UP would move to (5, 2), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'), causing a collision.\n  - DOWN would move to (7, 2), a wall (collision).\n  - LEFT again would move to (6, 1), then (6, 0) (wall), leading to collision.\n\n### Analysis of RIGHT:\n- Moving RIGHT takes the head to (6, 4) (empty space, no collision). This direction allows safer paths:\n  - Subsequent moves (UP, DOWN, or RIGHT) avoid immediate collisions. For example, moving UP from (6, 4) to (5, 4) (empty), then UP to (4, 4) (empty), and LEFT to (4, 3) (which contains an 'A'), allowing the snake to eat an apple and grow.\n\n### Conclusion:\nRIGHT is the safer and more strategic choice, as it avoids immediate collisions and enables a path to an apple in future moves.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n#      #\n# SA   #\n# SSS  #\n#   SH #\n########\n\nTo determine the next direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n- **Snake Head Position**: (Row 6, Column 4) (marked 'H').\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT (snake is moving right).\n- **Snake Body Positions**: (Row 4, Column 2), (Row 5, Columns 2-4), (Row 6, Column 3) (marked 'S').\n- **Apples**: (Row 1, Column 4), (Row 2, Column 2), (Row 4, Column 3) (marked 'A').\n\n### Valid Directions (Cannot reverse RIGHT, so options are UP, DOWN, RIGHT):\n1. **UP**: Moving up would take the head to (Row 5, Column 4).

The only valid direction is UP, which moves the head to (5,6), a safe empty space not occupied by the snake's body or walls.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#  SS H#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (5,5) (row 5, column 5). The current direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). The possible directions to consider are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n### Analysis of each direction:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP from (5,5) leads to (4,5). This position is empty (no wall or body collision). The apple at (4,3) is two steps to the left from (4,5), making this a path toward an apple.\n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (5,5) leads to (5,4). This position is empty, but the next move left would risk collision with the body segment at (5,3).\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (5,5) leads to (5,6). This position is empty but is farther from the nearest apples (at (4,3), (2,2), (1,3)).\n\n### Optimal Choice:\nContinuing UP moves the snake toward the apple at (4,3) in a clear path with no immediate collision risks. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#  A  H#\n#   S S#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state:\n- **Head position**: (4,6) (row 4, column 6)\n- **Current direction**: UP (snake cannot reverse to DOWN)\n- **Possible directions**: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is invalid as it reverses direction)\n- **Apples**: At (1,3), (2,2), and (4,3)\n- **Body positions**: (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\n### Analysis of each possible direction:\n1. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (4,6) would take the head to (4,7), which is a wall (collision). Invalid.\n2. **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (3,6). This position is empty (no apple, no body collision). Safe but does not lead directly to an apple.\n3. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (4,5). This position is empty (no apple, no body collision). Safe, and this direction aligns with the apple at (4,3) (same row, 3 columns to the left). Moving LEFT now allows the snake to approach (4,3) in subsequent moves (e.g., LEFT again to (4,4), then LEFT to (4,3) to eat the apple).\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT is the best choice as it avoids immediate collision, maintains safety, and positions the snake to reach the apple at (4,3) efficiently.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#  A HS#\n#     S#\n#   SSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (row 4, column 5), and the current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so the possible directions to choose are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (RIGHT is invalid as it is the reverse of LEFT). \n\nKey observations:\n- The snake aims to eat apples (A) to grow. Apples are located at (row 1, column 3), (row 2, column 2), and (row 4, column 3).\n- The closest apple is at (row 4, column 3), which is two squares to the left of the current head position (row 4, column 5).\n- Moving LEFT (current direction) will move the head to (row 4, column 4), which is empty (no wall or body collision). This positions the snake to reach the apple at (row 4, column 3) in the next move.\n- Moving UP or DOWN would take the head away from the nearest apple, delaying apple consumption.\n\nThus, the optimal direction is to continue moving LEFT to approach the closest apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#  AHSS#\n#     S#\n#    SS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4,3) (row 4, column 3). The current direction is LEFT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). The possible directions to choose are LEFT, UP, or DOWN.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving left from (4,3) leads to (4,2), which contains an apple ('A'). This is safe (no wall or self-collision) and will allow the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score.\n- **UP**: Moving up from (4,3) leads to (3,3), which is empty.

The snake cannot reverse direction, so possible next directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT. \n\n### Analysis of possible directions:\n1. **LEFT**: Next head position is (4,2). This cell is empty (no wall or body collision). Moving LEFT does not reach an apple immediately but could lead toward the apple at (2,2) in subsequent steps.  \n2. **UP**: Next head position is (3,3). This cell is empty (no collision). Moving UP aligns the snake with the apples at (1,3) and (1,4) (directly above in column 3), providing a clear path to these apples in subsequent moves.  \n3. **DOWN**: Next head position is (5,3). This cell is empty, but moving DOWN takes the snake away from the apples (located in rows 1 and 2), making it less optimal.  \n\n### Best choice:\nMoving UP is the best option, as it positions the snake to approach the apples in row 1 ( (1,3) and (1,4) ) and row 2 ( (2,2) ) efficiently without risk of collision.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#   AA #\n# A    #\n#  H   #\n#  SSSS#\n#     S#\n#     S#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head (H) is at (row 3, column 3).\n- **Current Direction**: UP (cannot reverse to DOWN).\n- **Apple Positions**: Apples (A) are at (row 1, column 3), (row 1, column 4), and (row 2, column 2).\n- **Body Positions**: The snake’s body (S) occupies (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,6), (6,6).\n\n### Valid Directions:\nSince the current direction is UP, the snake cannot reverse to DOWN. Valid directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. We evaluate each:\n\n1. **UP Direction**:  \n   Moving UP takes the head to (row 2, column 3). This position is empty (no collision with walls or body). From (2,3), the next move UP would reach (row 1, column 3), which contains an apple. This path is safe and leads directly to an apple in the next step.\n\n2. **LEFT Direction**:  \n   Moving LEFT takes the head to (row 3, column 2). This position is empty. From (3,2), the next move UP would reach (row 2, column 2), which contains an apple. This path is also safe but requires a turn.\n\n3. **RIGHT Direction**:  \n   Moving RIGHT takes the head to (row 3, column 4). This position is empty. From (3,4), the next move UP would reach (row 2, column 4) (empty), and a subsequent UP move would reach (row 1, column 4) (apple). This path is longer (requires two additional steps).\n\n### Optimal Choice:\nMoving UP is the most direct path to an apple (row 1, column 3) with no immediate risks. It aligns with the current direction and minimizes steps to reach an apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#   AA #\n# AH   #\n#  S   #\n#  SSSS#\n#     S#\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Position**: The snake's head (H) is at (row 2, column 2). The body segments (S) are at (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), and (5,5). The current movement direction is UP.\n\n2. **Possible Directions**: The snake cannot reverse direction (UP → DOWN is invalid). Valid directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n3. **Analysis of Each Direction**:\n   - **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (1,2). This cell is empty (no apple), so the snake does not grow. No collision risk (walls or self).\n   - **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (2,1). This cell contains an apple (A). Eating the apple increases the score by 1 and the snake grows in length (tail is not removed). No collision risk.\n   - **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (2,3). This cell is empty (no apple), so the snake does not grow. No collision risk.\n\n4. **Optimal Choice**: The only direction that allows the snake to eat an apple (increasing the score and length) is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n# A AA #\n# HS   #\n#  S   #\n#  SSSS#\n#     S#\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is located at row 2, column 1. The current direction is LEFT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). Moving LEFT would take the head to row 2, column 0, which is a wall (fatal collision). Thus, the valid directions are UP or DOWN.\n\n### Analysis of UP:\n- Moving UP would take the head to row 1, column 1 (empty, no collision). \n- Row 1, column 2 is an apple ('A'). After moving UP, the head is at row 1, column 1, adjacent to this apple. In the next move, the snake can turn RIGHT (valid, as the new direction would be UP, and RIGHT is not a reversal) to reach row 1, column 2 and eat the apple, increasing the score.\n\n### Analysis of DOWN:\n- Moving DOWN would take the head to row 3, column 1 (empty, no collision). \n- This position is further from the apples (located in row 1), making it less optimal for reaching apples quickly.\n\nThus, moving UP positions the snake to potentially eat an apple in the next move, making it the better choice.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is as follows:\n########\n# H AA #\n# SS   #\n#  S   #\n#  SSSS#\n#     S#\n#  A   #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (row 1, column 2). The current direction is UP, but moving UP would take the head to row 0, column 2, which is a wall, causing a collision. The snake cannot reverse direction (UP → DOWN is invalid). Thus, the valid directions are LEFT or RIGHT.\n\n- **Moving LEFT**: The head would move to (row 1, column 1), which is empty (safe). However, this direction does not lead toward any apples, and subsequent moves may risk wall collisions (e.g., moving LEFT again would reach row 1, column 0, a wall).  \n- **Moving RIGHT**: The head would move to (row 1, column 3), which is empty (safe). From here, the next move (if direction remains RIGHT) would take the head to (row 1, column 4), where an apple ('A') is located. Eating this apple would increase the score and grow the snake, which is optimal.  \n\nThus, the best choice is to move RIGHT to position the snake to eat an apple in the next epoch.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# SHAA #\n# SS   #\n#  S   #\n#  SSSS#\n#      #\n#  A   #\n########\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is located at row 1, column 3. The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse to LEFT. \n\n- **Moving UP**: The next position would be row 0, column 3, which is a wall ('#'). This would cause a collision, ending the game.  \n- **Moving DOWN**: The next position would be row 2, column 3, which is empty (' '). No collision occurs, but there is no apple here, so the snake does not grow.  \n- **Moving RIGHT**: The next position is row 1, column 4, which contains an apple ('A'). This is safe (no wall or self-collision), and eating the apple increases the score and grows the snake.  \n\nMoving RIGHT is the optimal choice as it allows the snake to eat an apple and avoid immediate danger. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n# SSHA #\n# SS   #\n#  S   #\n#  SSSS#\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT, and the snake's head (H) is at row 1, column 3. The snake is moving right, and the next position for the head would be row 1, column 4. Checking row 1, column 4, there is an apple ('A') in that cell. \n\nMoving RIGHT is valid because:\n- It does not reverse the current direction (RIGHT → RIGHT is allowed).\n- The next position (row 1, column 4) is within the board (not a wall) and contains an apple, so the snake will eat the apple, grow in length, and increase the score. \n\nOther directions:\n- UP would move the head to row 0, column 3 (a wall), causing a collision and game over.\n- DOWN would move the head to row 2, column 3 (empty space), but no apple is present here, so the snake would not gain length or score.\n\nThus, the optimal choice is to continue moving RIGHT to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n# SSSH #\n# SS   #\n# AS   #\n#  SSSS#\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 1, column 5).\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT (snake cannot reverse to LEFT).\n- **Valid Directions**: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (LEFT is invalid as it reverses the current direction).\n- **Wall Check**: Moving UP from (1,5) leads to row 0 (wall), so UP is invalid.\n- **Body Check**: Moving DOWN to (2,5) or RIGHT to (1,6) both land on empty cells (no collision with the snake’s body or walls).\n- **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (3,2), (6,3), and (6,5). The goal is to navigate toward these apples.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Moves:\n1. **Moving RIGHT**:  \n   The head moves to (1,6), which is empty. This keeps the snake moving in its current direction, avoiding immediate obstacles. Subsequent moves can then guide the snake downward toward the apples at (6,3) or (6,5) without blocking critical paths.\n\n2. **Moving DOWN**:  \n   The head moves to (2,5), which is also empty. However, this direction does not immediately progress toward the apples and may limit options for future movement (e.g., potential collisions with the body when moving further down).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT is safer and maintains momentum toward the apples in the lower rows (e.g., (6,5)). It avoids walls and body collisions while keeping the snake on a path that can eventually reach the apples.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# SSSSH#\n# SS   #\n# AS   #\n#  SSS #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is located at row 1, column 6.

The possible directions to choose from are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. \n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (2,5) would take the head to (2,6), which is a wall (row 2 ends with '#'). This causes a collision, so RIGHT is invalid.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (2,5) would take the head to (2,4), which is an empty space (no wall or body collision). This is safe but does not immediately reach an apple.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (2,5) would take the head to (3,5), which is an empty space (row 3, column 5 is a space). This is safe and keeps the snake moving toward row 6, where two apples ('A') are located (at (6,2) and (6,4)).  \n\nSince moving DOWN keeps the snake on a path toward the apples in row 6 and avoids immediate collisions, it is the optimal choice.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# SS  S#\n# AS  H#\n#  S   #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (3,5) (row 3, column 5).

However, the next move LEFT from (3,4) would lead to (3,3), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'), causing a collision. This makes LEFT risky.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (3,5) takes the head to (4,5), which is empty (' '). This direction avoids immediate collision and allows the snake to move toward the apples in row 6 (columns 2 and 4). Continuing DOWN can lead the snake to reach these apples safely in subsequent moves.  \n\nThe safest and most strategic choice is to continue moving DOWN. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# SSSSS#\n# SS  S#\n# AS  S#\n#     H#\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, we analyze the current state:\n- The snake's head 'H' is at position (4,5) (row 4, column 5).\n- Current direction is DOWN, so the snake cannot reverse to UP.

The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). We evaluate UP, DOWN, and LEFT:\n\n1. **DOWN**: The head is at (6,2) (row 6, column 2). Moving DOWN would take the head to (7,2), which is a wall (row 7 is all '#'). This causes a collision, ending the game. **DOWN is invalid**.\n\n2. **LEFT**: The head would move to (6,1), which is empty (no wall or body collision). However, continuing LEFT from (6,1) would lead to (6,0) (a wall), limiting future movement. This path is safe but less efficient for reaching apples.\n\n3. **UP**: The head moves to (5,2), which is empty (no collision). This direction aligns with the positions of apples (row 3, columns 1-3). Moving UP allows the snake to progress toward the apples (e.g., (5,2) → (4,2) → (3,2) (an apple in 3 moves)), making it the most efficient path.\n\nThus, the best direction is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#  SSSS#\n#     S#\n# AAA S#\n#     S#\n#  H  S#\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The snake's head ('H') is at row 5, column 3 (0-indexed from top). The current direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse to DOWN.\n- **Apples**: Apples ('A') are located at row 3, columns 2, 3, and 4 (i.e., positions (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)).\n- **Safety**: The snake must avoid walls ('#') and self-collision (body 'S').\n\n### Direction Options:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP from (5,3) takes the head to (4,3). This cell is empty (no wall or body), so it is safe. From (4,3), the next move (if direction remains UP) would reach (3,3), which is an apple. This path directly targets an apple.\n2. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (5,3) takes the head to (5,2). This cell is empty but moves the snake away from the apples, delaying apple consumption.\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (5,3) takes the head to (5,4). This cell is empty but also moves the snake away from the closest apple at (3,3).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP is optimal because it directly positions the snake to reach an apple in the next move (epoch 34), maximizing score growth.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#   SSS#\n#     S#\n# AAA S#\n#  H  S#\n#  S  S#\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nThe current direction is UP. The snake's head is at (4,2). Moving UP would take the head to (3,2), which is an apple ('A'). This move is safe as (3,2) is not a wall or part of the snake's body. Turning LEFT or RIGHT would move the head to empty spaces without apples, providing no score gain. Continuing in the current direction (UP) allows the snake to eat an apple, increase the score, and grow. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#   SSS#\n#  A  S#\n# AHA S#\n#  S  S#\n#  S  S#\n#  SSSS#\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is located at position (row 3, column 3) on the board. The current direction is UP, so the snake cannot reverse to DOWN. Possible directions to choose are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n### Analysis of each possible direction:\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (row 2, column 3), which is an empty space (safe). However, continuing UP from there would lead to (row 1, column 3) (still safe), but a subsequent UP move would hit the top wall (row 0, column 3 is a '#'), making this path risky long-term.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (row 3, column 4), which is an apple ('A') (safe). Eating this apple increases the score, but the next move (RIGHT to row 3, column 5) leads to empty space, with no immediate apples nearby.\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (row 3, column 2), which is an apple ('A') (safe). After eating this apple, the next move could be UP to (row 2, column 2), which is another apple ('A'), allowing the snake to eat a second apple quickly. This path avoids walls and aligns with the location of remaining apples.\n\n### Conclusion:\nLEFT is the optimal choice as it allows the snake to eat an apple immediately and positions it to reach another apple in the next move, maximizing score growth while avoiding collisions.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#   SSS#\n#  A  S#\n# HSA S#\n#  S  S#\n#  S  S#\n#A SSSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state, snake position, and possible moves.

We evaluate the safety and potential to eat apples for the remaining options: UP, DOWN, or continuing LEFT.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Current Direction (LEFT):** Moving LEFT would take the head to (3, 1), which is empty (safe). However, a subsequent LEFT move would hit the wall (column 0 is a wall), making this direction risky long-term.\n2. **Direction UP:** Moving UP takes the head to (2, 2), which is empty (safe). From (2, 2), the next move could be RIGHT (allowed, as direction would then be UP, and RIGHT is not a reversal). This would reach (2, 3), where an apple ('A') is located, allowing the snake to eat it and grow.\n3. **Direction DOWN:** Moving DOWN takes the head to (4, 2), which is empty (safe). However, from (4, 2), moving RIGHT would collide with the snake’s body (row 4, column 3 is 'S'), making this direction less favorable.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP is the safest and most strategic choice, as it positions the snake to reach an apple in the next move.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#    SS#\n# HA  S#\n# SSA S#\n#  S  S#\n#  S  S#\n#A SSSS#\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, we analyze the current state:\n\n- **Snake Head Position**: (Row 2, Column 2) (denoted by 'H').\n- **Current Direction**: UP (snake cannot reverse to DOWN).\n- **Possible Directions**: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is invalid as it reverses direction).\n- **Apple Positions**: At (Row 2, Column 3), (Row 3, Column 3), and (Row 6, Column 1).\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **UP**: Moving to (Row 1, Column 2).

The body ('S') occupies multiple cells, including (1,1)-(1,6), (2,2)-(2,6), (3,4)-(3,6), (4,4)-(4,6), and (5,4)-(5,5).  \n2. **Current Direction**: The snake is moving DOWN.  \n3. **Movement Rules**: The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., from DOWN to UP). Valid directions are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.  \n4. **Collision Checks**:  \n   - **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (2,1) would take the head to (2,0), which is a wall ('#'). This causes a collision.  \n   - **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (2,1) would take the head to (2,2), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This causes a self-collision.  \n   - **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (2,1) takes the head to (3,1).

This causes an immediate collision. **Invalid**.\n   \n2. **DOWN**: Moving down takes the head to (row 4, column 1). This cell is empty (no wall or body). Safe, but no apple here. The snake would need a subsequent move (e.g., RIGHT to (row 4, column 2)) to reach an apple.\n\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving right takes the head to (row 3, column 2). This cell is empty (no wall or body). Safe, and this position is one step away from the apple at (row 4, column 2) (reachable by moving DOWN next).\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT are safe, but RIGHT positions the head closer to the nearest apple at (row 4, column 2), allowing a more direct path to eat it in the next move. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#SSSSSS#\n#S  SSS#\n#SH SSS#\n# A SSS#\n#   SS #\n#A  A  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game board and constraints:\n\n1. **Snake's Head Position**: The head (H) is at (row 3, column 2).\n2. **Current Direction**: RIGHT.

This is safe but does not increase the score.\n- **UP**: The head would move to (2, 2), which is a space (no apple, no collision). Safe but no score gain.\n- **DOWN**: The head would move to (4, 2), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1 and grows the snake. (4, 2) is not part of the snake’s body (S) or a wall, so no collision occurs.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN allows the snake to eat an apple, increasing the score and growing the snake, which is optimal.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#SSSSSS#\n#S  SSS#\n#SS SSS#\n# H SSS#\n#   SS #\n#AA A  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 4, column 2) (0-indexed).  \n2. **Current Direction**: The snake is moving DOWN.

This position is not occupied by the snake's body or a wall, so it is safe. Eating the apple will increase the score and grow the snake.\n- **Moving LEFT**: The head would move to (5, 1), an empty space with no apple, resulting in no score gain.\n- **Moving RIGHT**: The head would move to (5, 3), an empty space with no apple, resulting in no score gain.\n\nMoving DOWN is the optimal choice as it allows the snake to eat an apple, increase the score, and safely grow. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#SSSSSS#\n#SA  SS#\n#SS SSS#\n# S SSS#\n# S SS #\n#AH A  #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Snake Head Position**: The head ('H') is at (row 6, column 2).  \n2. **Current Direction**: The snake is moving DOWN.  \n3. **Collision Rules**: The snake cannot reverse direction (so UP is invalid), and moving DOWN would collide with the wall (row 7 is a wall), making DOWN invalid. Thus, valid directions are LEFT or RIGHT.  \n\n### Analysis of LEFT:  \nMoving LEFT would take the head to (row 6, column 1), which contains an apple ('A').

Eating this apple will increase the score by 1 and cause the snake to grow (the previous head position (4,2) will become part of the body).\n\nChoosing RIGHT allows the snake to eat an apple immediately, which is optimal for maximizing the score. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n#  SH  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4,4) (row 4, column 4), and the body (S) is at (4,3). The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). The possible directions to choose are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n### Analysis of each direction:\n1. **RIGHT (current direction)**:  \n   The head would move to (4,5), which is empty (safe). However, continuing RIGHT long-term risks hitting the right wall (column 7) in future moves (e.g., (4,6) → (4,7) is a wall).  \n\n2. **UP**:  \n   The head would move to (3,4), which is empty (safe). This direction positions the snake to potentially move left toward the apple at (3,1) (row 3, column 1) in subsequent steps (e.g., UP → LEFT → LEFT → LEFT to reach the apple).  \n\n3. **DOWN**:  \n   The head would move to (5,4), which is empty (safe). This direction positions the snake to potentially move left toward the apple at (5,1) (row 5, column 1) in subsequent steps (e.g., DOWN → LEFT → LEFT → LEFT to reach the apple).  \n\n### Decision:  \nBoth UP and DOWN are safe and lead toward apples. However, moving RIGHT risks wall collision in the near future. Between UP and DOWN, UP is chosen as a safer initial step to avoid the bottom wall (row 7) and align with the apple at (3,1).  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#A  H  #\n#   S  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (3,4) (row 3, column 4) and is currently moving UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\nThe goal is to eat apples. The apples are at (2,3), (3,1), and (5,1). The closest apple is at (2,3) (Manhattan distance 2 from the head). \n\n- Moving UP would take the head to (2,4), which is empty but one step away from (2,3) (apple) via a LEFT move next epoch.  \n- Moving LEFT would take the head to (3,3), which is empty but one step away from (2,3) (apple) via an UP move next epoch.  \n- Moving RIGHT would take the head to (3,5), which is empty and farther from all apples.  \n\nMoving LEFT positions the head closer to the nearest apple (2,3) and allows the snake to reach it in the next epoch by moving UP. This path maximizes the chance to eat an apple soon.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#A HS  #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's current direction is LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT. \n\n- **Moving LEFT**: The head (at (3,3)) would move to (3,2), which is empty. No apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow.  \n- **Moving DOWN**: The head would move to (4,3), which is empty. No apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow.  \n- **Moving UP**: The head would move to (2,3), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1, and the snake grows in length. The new head position (2,3) is within the board and does not collide with the snake's body (current body is at (3,3) and (3,4)).  \n\nMoving UP allows the snake to eat an apple, which is optimal for maximizing the score. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#      #\n#  HA  #\n#A S   #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, analyze the current game state:\n\n- **Snake Head Position**: (Row 2, Column 3) (marked 'H').\n- **Current Direction**: UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid).\n- **Possible Directions**: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (since DOWN is a reversal).\n- **Apple Positions**: \n  - (Row 2, Column 4) (adjacent to the head, right direction).\n  - (Row 3, Column 2) and (Row 5, Column 2) (other apples).\n\n### Analysis of Directions:\n1. **UP**: The head moves to (Row 1, Column 3). This square is empty (no apple), and no collision occurs. Safe but no score gain.\n2. **LEFT**: The head moves to (Row 2, Column 2). This square is empty (no apple), and no collision occurs. Safe but no score gain.\n3. **RIGHT**: The head moves to (Row 2, Column 4), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1 and grows the snake. No collision with walls or the snake's body (body is at (Row 3, Column 4)). Safe and beneficial.\n\nThe best move is to turn RIGHT to eat the adjacent apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#  SH  #\n#A S   #\n#  A   #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (2,4), and the current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so cannot go LEFT). We need to choose a direction (UP, DOWN, or RIGHT) that avoids collisions and moves toward apples.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Directions:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (1,4). This is safe (no collision), but the next move upward could hit the top wall (row 0), making this risky.\n2. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (2,5). This is safe, but this direction leads toward the right edge (column 6), with no apples nearby. Further right could hit the wall (column 7).\n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (3,4). This is safe (no collision). This direction positions the snake closer to the nearest apple at (4,3) (Manhattan distance 3), allowing a path to reach the apple in subsequent moves (e.g., DOWN → LEFT → DOWN).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN is the best choice, as it avoids immediate collision, positions the snake closer to the nearest apple, and avoids risky paths toward walls.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#      #\n#  SS  #\n#A  H  #\n#  A   #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Game Board Analysis:\n- **Snake Head (H)** is at position (3,4) (row 3, column 4).\n- **Snake Body (S)** is at positions (2,2) and (2,3).\n- **Apples (A)** are at positions (3,1), (4,2), and (5,1).\n- **Current Direction**: DOWN (snake cannot reverse to UP).\n- **Valid Moves**: LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (since reversing to UP is invalid).\n\n### Evaluation of Possible Moves:\n1. **DOWN**:  \n   The head moves from (3,4) to (4,4).  \n   - (4,4) is empty (no wall or body collision).  \n   - This positions the snake to approach the apple at (4,2) in subsequent moves (next left to (4,3), then left to (4,2)).  \n\n2. **LEFT**:  \n   The head moves from (3,4) to (3,3).  \n   - (3,3) is empty, but this path leads toward the apple at (3,1) (requires 3 steps: (3,3) → (3,2) → (3,1)), which is slower than reaching (4,2).  \n\n3. **RIGHT**:  \n   The head moves from (3,4) to (3,5).  \n   - (3,5) is empty, but this direction moves away from all apples, making it less optimal.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving **DOWN** is the best choice, as it safely positions the snake to reach the nearest apple at (4,2) in 2 subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#   S  #\n#A  S  #\n#  AH  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (4,4) (row 4, column 4). The current direction is DOWN, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so UP is invalid). The possible directions to choose are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. \n\n- **Moving DOWN**: The head would move to (5,4), which is empty (no apple, no collision). This is safe but does not eat an apple.  \n- **Moving RIGHT**: The head would move to (4,5), which is empty (no apple, no collision). This is safe but does not eat an apple.  \n- **Moving LEFT**: The head would move to (4,3), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple increases the score by 1 and grows the snake. (4,3) is not a wall or body part (current body segments are at (2,3) and (3,4)), so this move is safe and beneficial.  \n\nThe best choice is to move LEFT to eat the apple. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#      #\n#   S  #\n#A  S  #\n#  HS  #\n#A   A #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state, snake position, and apple locations. The snake's head is at (4,3) (row 4, column 3), moving LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid), leaving UP, DOWN, or LEFT as options.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Current Board Layout**: Apples are at (3,1), (5,1), and (5,4). The snake’s body segments are at (2,3), (3,4), and (4,4).\n2. **Safety Check**:\n   - **LEFT**: New head position (4,2) is empty (no wall\/body collision).\n   - **UP**: New head position (3,3) is empty (no collision).\n   - **DOWN**: New head position (5,3) is empty (no collision).\n3. **Apple Proximity**:\n   - Moving DOWN to (5,3) places the head one step away from the apple at (5,4). From (5,3), the next move (RIGHT, allowed since direction would be DOWN) would reach (5,4) (an apple), increasing the score.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN is optimal as it positions the snake to eat an apple in the next step.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#A  S  #\n#  SS  #\n#A H A #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. The snake's head ('H') is at (row 5, column 3), moving in the 'DOWN' direction. The snake cannot reverse direction (so 'UP' is invalid). Possible directions are 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', or 'DOWN'.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Apple Positions**: Apples ('A') are at (row 3, column 1), (row 5, column 1), and (row 5, column 5).\n2. **Snake Body**: The body ('S') is at (row 3, column 4), (row 4, column 3), and (row 4, column 4). No immediate collision risk with these positions for the next move.\n3. **Direction Constraints**: The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., 'DOWN' → 'UP' is invalid).\n\n### Analysis of Possible Moves:\n- **DOWN**: Next head position is (row 6, column 3) (empty space). No apple here. If continued, the next move would reach row 7 (a wall), causing collision. Not ideal for long-term apple collection.\n- **LEFT**: Next head position is (row 5, column 2) (empty space). From here, the snake can move LEFT again to (row 5, column 1), which contains an apple. This path avoids collision and leads to an apple in the next step.\n- **RIGHT**: Next head position is (row 5, column 4) (empty space). From here, the snake can move RIGHT again to (row 5, column 5), which contains an apple. This path also avoids collision and leads to an apple in the next step.\n\n### Decision:\nBoth 'LEFT' and 'RIGHT' can lead to eating an apple in the next move. However, moving 'LEFT' directly positions the snake to reach the apple at (row 5, column 1) in the subsequent move, which is safe and aligns with the goal of maximizing apple consumption.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n#  SS  #\n#AHS A #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is currently at position (row 5, column 2), moving LEFT. The snake's body segments are at (5,3), (4,3), and (4,2). The current direction is LEFT, and the snake cannot reverse to RIGHT. \n\nAnalyzing possible directions:\n- **LEFT**: Moving left from (5,2) leads to (5,1), which contains an apple ('A').

The body 'S' segments are at (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), and (4,4) (trailing the head in the direction of movement).\n- **Current Direction**: LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., cannot turn RIGHT immediately).\n- **Apples**: Located at (row 2, column 2), (row 3, column 1), and (row 5, column 5).\n- **Collision Risks**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (5,0), which is a wall (game over). Moving RIGHT is invalid (reverse direction). Moving DOWN would take the head to (6,1), which is safe but leads toward a wall in subsequent moves.\n\n### Viable Directions:\n1. **UP**: Moving up from (5,1) takes the head to (4,1), which is empty (no collision with body or walls). This position is safe. From (4,1), the next move (if direction remains UP) would reach (3,1), where an apple is located. Eating this apple would increase the score and grow the snake.\n2. **DOWN**: Moving down to (6,1) is safe but leads toward row 7 (a wall) in the next move, risking collision.\n3. **LEFT\/RIGHT**: LEFT leads to a wall; RIGHT is a reverse direction (invalid).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP is the safest and most strategic choice, as it positions the snake to reach an apple in the next move.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#      #\n# A    #\n#A     #\n#H S   #\n#SSS A #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving UP.

Eating the apple is safe (no collision with walls or self), increases the score by 1, and allows the snake to grow. \n- **LEFT**: The head would move to (5,1), which is a wall ('#'), causing an immediate game-over. \n- **RIGHT**: The head would move to (5,3), an empty space with no apple.

We evaluate each:\n\n1. **UP**:  \n   Moving UP would take the head to (row 2, column 1), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score by 1, and the snake grows in length. The new head position (row 2, column 1) is not a wall or part of the snake's body, so this move is safe.\n\n2. **LEFT**:  \n   Moving LEFT would take the head to (row 3, column 0), which is a wall ('#'). This causes a collision, ending the game. This move is invalid.\n\n3. **RIGHT**:  \n   Moving RIGHT would take the head to (row 3, column 2), an empty space. No apple is eaten, so the snake does not grow, and the tail would shrink by one segment.

No collision, but no apple is eaten.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (row 2, column 0), which is a wall. This causes a collision, ending the game.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (row 2, column 2), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score, grows the snake, and avoids collision (no walls or body segments here).  \n\nThe optimal choice is to move RIGHT to eat the apple and safely grow the snake. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# A    #\n#SH    #\n#SA    #\n#S     #\n#SSS A #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (2, 2) (row 2, column 2), with the body segments at (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), and (5, 3). The current direction is RIGHT, and the snake cannot reverse to LEFT. The available directions to choose from are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n- Moving RIGHT would take the head to (2, 3), which is empty (no apple or collision).  \n- Moving UP would take the head to (1, 2), which is also empty.  \n- Moving DOWN would take the head to (3, 2), which contains an apple ('A').  \n\nMoving DOWN allows the snake to eat the apple at (3, 2), increasing the score by 1 and growing the snake.

The apples ('A') are at positions (1,1), (2,5), and (5,5).\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Current Direction Restrictions**: The snake can only move UP, DOWN, or continue RIGHT (LEFT is invalid due to reversal).\n2. **Apple Positions**: The closest apple is at (2,5) (row 2, column 5). Reaching this apple quickly maximizes the score.\n3. **Safety of Moves**:\n   - **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (3,5), which is empty (no collision with walls or body). From (3,5), the next move UP could reach (2,5) (the apple).\n   - **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (2,4), which is empty (no collision). From (2,4), the next move RIGHT directly reaches (2,5) (the apple), making this a shorter path to the apple.\n   - **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (4,4), which is empty, but this path is farther from the nearest apple (2,5).\n\n### Optimal Choice:\nMoving UP allows the snake to reach the nearest apple (2,5) in the next move (by turning RIGHT afterward), making it the most efficient direction.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# A    #\n#SS H A#\n#SSSS  #\n#S     #\n#S   A #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse to DOWN.

This causes a self-collision, ending the game.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (row 3, column 4), which is occupied by 'S' (the snake's body). This also causes a self-collision, ending the game.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (row 1, column 4).

The current direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse to DOWN. The goal is to choose a valid direction (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN) that avoids collisions with walls or the snake's body and ideally leads toward apples.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Directions:\n- **UP**: Moving UP from (1, 4) would take the head to (0, 4), which is a wall (row 0 is entirely walls). This causes an immediate collision, so UP is invalid.\n- **DOWN**: Reversing direction (from UP to DOWN) is not allowed per the rules, so DOWN is invalid.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (1, 4) would take the head to (1, 5). This position is a space (no wall or body collision). However, (1, 5) is not an apple, and moving RIGHT further risks hitting walls (e.g., (1, 6) is a wall) or the snake’s body (e.g., (2, 5) is an S in the current board).\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (1, 4) takes the head to (1, 3), a space with no collision. This direction aligns with the apple at (1, 1) (row 1, column 1). By continuing LEFT in subsequent moves, the snake can reach (1, 1) to eat the apple, avoiding walls and body collisions.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT is the safest and most strategic choice, as it avoids immediate collisions and positions the snake to reach an apple in subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# A HS #\n#SS SSA#\n# SSS  #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is located at row 1, column 4.

This causes an immediate collision, ending the game. **UP is invalid**.\n   \n2. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (row 2, column 2). This position is a space (safe initially). However, the surrounding cells (UP: (1,2) becomes body after moving; DOWN: (3,2) is body; LEFT: (2,1) is body; RIGHT: (2,3) is body) are all occupied by the snake’s body. The next move in any direction (LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN) would collide with the body, ending the game. **DOWN leads to certain death in the next step**.\n\n3. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to (row 1, column 1), a space (no collision). The snake’s tail (likely at (2,1), as it is a terminal body segment with only one adjacent body segment) is removed, freeing (2,1) as a space. After this move, the next possible directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT) can avoid collision:\n   - UP: (0,1) is a wall (invalid).\n   - DOWN: (2,1) is now a space (safe, as the tail was removed).\n   - LEFT: (1,0) is a wall (invalid).  \n   Thus, moving LEFT allows the snake to survive the next step by moving DOWN to (2,1) (now a space).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe safest direction to avoid immediate collision and extend the snake’s survival is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#HSSSS #\n#   SSA#\n# SSS  #\n#A     #\n#    A #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT.

This position is empty (not a wall or part of the snake's body), so it is safe. However, this direction moves the head away from the nearest apples (located at (5,5) and (6,3)), making it less optimal.\n\n2. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (5,3). This position is empty and safe. This direction moves the head closer to the apple at (5,5) (row 5, column 5) and the apple at (6,3) (row 6, column 3).\n\n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (6,2).

Thus, UP is the best direction.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#SSSSSS#\n#SSSSSS#\n#SS   A#\n#SH A  #\n#SS   A#\n#SS    #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is currently at position (row 4, column 2) on the board. The current direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid). Let's analyze possible moves:\n\n- **UP**: Moving UP from (4,2) would take the head to (3,2). Row 3, column 2 is 'S' (snake's body), which causes a self-collision. Invalid.\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (4,2) would take the head to (4,1). Row 4, column 1 is 'S' (snake's body), causing a self-collision. Invalid.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (4,2) would take the head to (4,3). Row 4, column 3 is 'A' (apple). This is safe (no collision with walls or self) and allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score. Valid.\n- **DOWN**: Reversing direction (current direction is UP), which is not allowed. Invalid.\n\nThe only valid and safe direction is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SSSSSS#\n#SSSSSS#\n#S    A#\n#SSHA  #\n#SS   A#\n#SS    #\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, we analyze the current state:\n- The snake's head (H) is at position (4, 3) (row 4, column 3).\n- Current direction is RIGHT, so the snake cannot reverse to LEFT. Possible directions: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n- Moving RIGHT: The next head position is (4, 4), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple will increase the score by 1, and the snake will grow in length. The new head position (4, 4) is not a wall or part of the snake's body (since it was an apple), so no collision occurs.\n- Moving UP or DOWN: The next head positions (3, 3) or (5, 3) are empty spaces (no apples), so the snake would not gain a score, and the tail would shrink (no growth). These directions do not provide immediate benefits.\n\nThus, moving RIGHT is optimal as it allows the snake to eat an apple, grow, and avoid collisions.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#SSSSSS#\n#SSSSSS#\n#S  A A#\n#SSSH  #\n#SS   A#\n#SS    #\n########\n\nThe current direction is RIGHT, and the snake's head is at position (4,4) (row 4, column 4). The snake cannot reverse direction, so LEFT is invalid. We need to evaluate UP, DOWN, and RIGHT:\n\n- **RIGHT**: The head would move to (4,5). This cell is empty (no apple), and no collision with walls or the snake's body (since (4,5) is a space). However, no apple is eaten here.\n- **DOWN**: The head would move to (5,4). This cell is empty (no apple), and no collision with walls or the snake's body (since (5,4) is a space). No apple is eaten here.\n- **UP**: The head would move to (3,4). This cell contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score by 1, and the snake grows in length. (3,4) is not part of the snake's body (current body segments are in rows 1-2, (3,1), (4,1-3), (5,1-2), (6,1-2)), so no collision occurs.\n\nMoving UP allows the snake to eat an apple, which is optimal for maximizing the score. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\n########\n#SSSSSS#\n#SSSSSS#\n#S  H A#\n#SSSS  #\n#SS   A#\n#SSA   #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is currently at position (3, 4) (row 3, column 4).

We need to check possible directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) for safety and apple proximity:\n\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (2, 4). Row 2 is entirely \"SSSSSS\" between columns 1-6, so (2, 4) is part of the snake's body. Collision would occur; UP is invalid.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (3, 3), which is empty (safe). However, (3, 3) is surrounded by body segments (e.g., (2, 3) in row 2 is S), limiting future moves and no immediate apple nearby.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (3, 5), which is empty (safe). From (3, 5), the next move RIGHT would reach (3, 6), where an apple ('A') is located. This path allows the snake to eat an apple in the next step, increasing the score.  \n\nRIGHT is the optimal choice as it avoids collision, leads to an apple, and maintains a safe path. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#SSSSSS#\n#S SSSS#\n#S  SHA#\n#SSSS  #\n#SS   A#\n#SSA   #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, analyze the current state:\n\n1. **Snake Head Position**: The head 'H' is at (row 3, column 5).  \n2. **Current Direction**: RIGHT.

This cell is empty (no wall or snake body), so it is safe.  \n\nThe goal is to eat apples. The nearest apples are at (5,5), (6,3), and (6,5). Moving LEFT to (4,5) positions the head one step away from (5,5) (directly below), allowing the next move to DOWN to reach the apple. Similarly, moving DOWN to (5,6) positions the head one step away from (5,5) (directly left).

This is safe but does not collect an apple.  \n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (4, 2), which is empty (no apple). This is safe but does not collect an apple.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (4, 4), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating this apple will increase the score by 1 and grow the snake's length. The new head position (4, 4) is within the board and has no collision with walls or the snake's body (since the snake starts with length 1).  \n\nChoosing RIGHT allows the snake to immediately eat an apple, which is optimal. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# A   A#\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#  SH  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (4, 3) (row 4, column 3) and is currently moving RIGHT. The snake's body is at (4, 2). The apples are located at (1, 1), (1, 4), and (2, 2). The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). The possible directions to choose are RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. \n\n- **RIGHT**: The head would move to (4, 4), which is empty. This continues the current direction but does not lead toward the nearest apples.  \n- **DOWN**: The head would move to (5, 3), which is empty but moves the snake away from the apples (located in rows 1 and 2).  \n- **UP**: The head would move to (3, 3), which is empty. This direction moves the snake upward toward the apples (specifically the apple at (2, 2), the closest apple). From (3, 3), the snake can continue moving UP to (2, 3) and then LEFT to (2, 2) (the apple), making this path optimal for reaching an apple quickly.  \n\nThus, the best direction is UP. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# A   A#\n#  A   #\n#   H  #\n#   S  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, we analyze the snake's current state. The snake's head (H) is at row 3, column 3 (0-indexed from top), and the body (S) is at row 4, column 3. The current direction is UP, so the snake cannot reverse to DOWN. Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n### Analysis of each direction:\n- **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to row 2, column 3. This cell contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score by 1 and grows the snake. After moving, the head moves to (2,3) (A), the old head position (3,3) becomes a new body segment, and the existing body (4,3) remains. No collision with walls or self occurs. This is safe and beneficial.\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT takes the head to row 3, column 2 (empty). The body follows to (3,3). No apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow. This is safe but not optimal.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to row 3, column 4 (empty). The body follows to (3,3). No apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow. This is safe but not optimal.\n- **DOWN**: Reversing direction (UP → DOWN) is invalid and not allowed.\n\nThe best choice is to move UP, as it allows the snake to eat an apple, grow, and avoid collisions.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# A   A#\n#  AH  #\n#   S  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (2,3) (row 2, column 3), with a body segment (S) at (3,3). The current direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse to DOWN. Possible directions to choose are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n### Analysis of Possible Moves:\n1. **UP**: The head moves from (2,3) to (1,3). This position is empty (no wall or body collision). After moving, the head is at (1,3), and the body shifts to (2,3) (old head position), with the previous tail (3,3) removed (no apple eaten). This keeps the snake safe and positions it one step away from the apple at (1,4) (column 4 of row 1). In the next epoch, a RIGHT move from (1,3) would reach the apple at (1,4).\n\n2. **LEFT**: The head moves from (2,3) to (2,2). This position is empty, but it moves away from the nearest apples (at (1,1) and (1,4)) and requires more steps to reach an apple.\n\n3. **RIGHT**: The head moves from (2,3) to (2,4). This position is empty, but it also requires a subsequent UP move to reach the apple at (1,4), similar to the UP path but with an extra direction change.\n\n### Optimal Choice:\nMoving UP is optimal because it positions the snake closer to the apple at (1,4) with minimal steps, maintaining safety and setting up for a future apple consumption.\n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# A H A#\n#  AS  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (row 1, column 4), and the body (S) is at (row 2, column 4). The current direction is UP, and the snake cannot reverse to DOWN. Moving UP would collide with the top wall (row 0), which is invalid. Thus, the snake must choose between LEFT or RIGHT.\n\n- **LEFT Direction**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (row 1, column 3), which is empty (no collision). This direction allows the snake to approach the apple at (row 1, column 2) in the next move (epoch 6) by continuing LEFT, which is safe and would result in eating the apple.\n- **RIGHT Direction**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (row 1, column 5), which is empty (no collision). This direction allows the snake to approach the apple at (row 1, column 6) in the next move (epoch 6) by continuing RIGHT, which is also safe and would result in eating the apple.\n\nBoth directions are valid, but choosing LEFT allows the snake to reach an apple in the next step without risk. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n# AHS A#\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (1,3) (row 1, column 3), with a body segment ('S') at (1,4). The current direction is LEFT, and the snake cannot reverse to RIGHT. The goal is to choose a direction (LEFT, UP, DOWN, RIGHT) that allows the snake to eat an apple, avoid collisions, and grow.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Directions:\n1. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (0,3), which is a wall (row 0 is entirely walls). This causes an immediate collision, ending the game. **Invalid**.\n   \n2. **RIGHT**: Reversing direction (current direction is LEFT) is not allowed. **Invalid**.\n\n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (2,3). The cell (2,3) contains an apple ('A'), so the snake would eat it, grow in length, and increase the score. The new head position (2,3) is within the board (no wall collision) and does not overlap with the body (current body is at (1,4)). **Valid**.\n\n4. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT (current direction) takes the head to (1,2). The cell (1,2) contains an apple ('A'), so the snake would eat it, grow in length, and increase the score. The new head position (1,2) is within the board (no wall collision) and does not overlap with the body (current body is at (1,4)). **Valid**.\n\n### Decision:\nBoth DOWN and LEFT are valid and allow the snake to eat an apple. However, moving LEFT continues the current direction (no need to change direction) and directly targets the apple in the snake's immediate path, making it the most straightforward and safe choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# HSS A#\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. The snake’s head is at (row 1, column 2), moving LEFT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid). The possible directions are UP, DOWN, or LEFT. \n\n- **UP**: Moving UP from (1,2) leads to (0,2), which is a wall (row 0 is all walls). This causes a collision, ending the game. **Invalid**.\n- **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (1,2) leads to (1,1), an empty space. However, continuing LEFT further would soon hit the wall (column 0). This path offers no immediate apples and risks wall collision.\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (1,2) leads to (2,2), an empty space. This position is safe and allows the snake to approach the apple at (2,3) (row 2, column 3). From (2,2), the next move (if direction is RIGHT) would reach the apple, increasing the score and growing the snake.\n\nThus, moving DOWN is the best choice, as it avoids immediate danger and positions the snake to eat an apple in the next step.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n# SS  A#\n# HA   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and potential outcomes:\n\n1. **Current State**: The snake's head ('H') is at (row 2, column 2). The body ('S') occupies (row 1, column 2) and (row 1, column 3). The current direction is DOWN, and the snake cannot reverse direction (so UP is invalid).\n\n2. **Possible Directions**: Valid options are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT (since UP is reversed).\n\n3. **Analysis of Each Direction**:\n   - **LEFT**: Moving left would take the head to (row 2, column 1), which is a wall ('#'). This causes a collision, ending the game. **Invalid**.\n   - **DOWN**: Moving down would take the head to (row 3, column 2), an empty space. The snake moves safely but does not eat an apple. **Safe but no score gain**.\n   - **RIGHT**: Moving right takes the head to (row 2, column 3), which contains an apple ('A'). Eating the apple increases the score by 1, and the snake grows in length. No collision occurs (the new head position is safe, and the body follows without self-collision). **Optimal move**.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n# SS  A#\n# SH   #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (row 2, column 3), and the current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction (so LEFT is invalid). We need to choose between UP, DOWN, or RIGHT, ensuring no collision with walls or the snake's body.\n\n### Analysis of possible directions:\n- **UP**: Moving up from (2,3) leads to (1,3), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This causes a collision, ending the game. **Invalid**.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving right from (2,3) leads to (2,4), which is empty. No collision, but no apple is present here. Safe but does not eat an apple.\n- **DOWN**: Moving down from (2,3) leads to (3,3), which is empty. No collision. This direction positions the snake to potentially reach the apple at (3,2) in the next move (by turning LEFT, as the new direction would be DOWN, allowing LEFT as a valid turn).\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN avoids immediate collision, positions the snake to reach an apple in the next move, and is the safest and most strategic choice.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n# S   A#\n# SS   #\n# AH   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: Head `H` is at (row 3, column 2). Body segments `S` are at (row 2, column 2), (row 2, column 1), and (row 1, column 1).\n- **Current Direction**: DOWN. The snake cannot reverse direction (so UP is invalid). Valid directions: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n- **Apples**: Located at (row 1, column 5), (row 3, column 1), and (row 6, column 1).\n\n### Analysis of Possible Moves:\n1. **LEFT**: Moving left from (3,2) takes the head to (3,1). This position contains an apple (`A`). Eating the apple increases the score and grows the snake. No collision risk (not a wall or body segment).\n2. **RIGHT**: Moving right from (3,2) takes the head to (3,3), an empty space. No apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow.\n3. **DOWN**: Moving down from (3,2) takes the head to (4,2), an empty space. No apple is eaten, and the snake does not grow.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT allows the snake to eat an apple, grow, and avoid collision. This is the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n# S   A#\n# SS   #\n# HS   #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (3, 1) (row 3, column 1). The current direction is LEFT, and the snake cannot reverse to RIGHT. We need to check possible directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT) for safety:\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving left from (3, 1) would take the head to (3, 0), which is a wall (edge of the board). This causes a collision. Invalid.\n- **UP**: Moving up from (3, 1) would take the head to (2, 1). This position is occupied by the snake's body (S). Collision with self. Invalid.\n- **DOWN**: Moving down from (3, 1) would take the head to (4, 1). This position is empty (space). Safe.\n\nThus, the only valid direction is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#     A#\n# SS   #\n# SS   #\n# H    #\n#  A   #\n#A     #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the snake's current state, possible moves, and apple positions. The snake is currently moving DOWN, with its head at (4,1) (row 4, column 1). The snake cannot reverse direction (UP is invalid), so valid directions are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Directions:\n1. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (4,0), which is a wall (column 0 is a wall). This causes an immediate collision, ending the game. **Invalid**.\n2. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (4,2), an empty space (no collision with walls or body). This is safe but does not reach an apple immediately.\n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN takes the head to (5,1), an empty space (no collision). From (5,1), the next move (if continuing DOWN) would reach (6,1), which contains an apple. This allows the snake to eat the apple in the next epoch, growing and increasing the score.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN is the safest and most strategic choice, as it positions the snake to reach an apple in the next move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n\n########\n#     A#\n#  S   #\n# SS   #\n# S    #\n# HA   #\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (row 5, column 1). The current direction is DOWN, so the snake cannot reverse to UP. The possible directions to consider are LEFT, RIGHT, or continuing DOWN. \n\n- **LEFT**: Moving left from (5,1) would take the head to (5,0), which is a wall (row 5 starts with '#'). This causes a collision with the wall, ending the game. LEFT is invalid.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving down from (5,1) leads to (6,1). Row 6 has '#A     #', so (6,1) is an apple ('A'). This is safe (no collision with walls or the snake's body), and the snake will eat the apple, increasing the score.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving right from (5,1) leads to (5,2). Row 5 has '# HA   #', so (5,2) is an apple ('A'). This is also safe (no collision with walls or the snake's body), and the snake will eat the apple, increasing the score.  \n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT are valid and allow the snake to eat an apple. However, moving RIGHT avoids approaching the bottom wall (row 7) and provides more flexibility for future moves (e.g., moving right again to (5,3) or down to (6,2) in subsequent steps). \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#     A#\n#  SA  #\n# SS   #\n# S    #\n# SH   #\n#A     #\n########\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (row 5, column 3), and the current direction is RIGHT. The snake cannot reverse direction, so possible moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. \n\n### Analysis of Possible Moves:\n1. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (5, 4). This position is empty (no wall or body collision), but there is no apple here. The snake would continue moving right, but this path does not directly approach any nearby apples.  \n2. **UP**: Moving UP would take the head to (4, 3). This position is empty, but the next move upward could lead to (3, 3), which is occupied by the snake's body (from row 3: \"# SS   #\"), risking a collision.  \n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN would take the head to (6, 3). This position is empty (no wall or body collision). From (6, 3), the snake can then move LEFT twice to reach (6, 1), where an apple ('A') is located. This path is safe and directly approaches the nearest apple.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving DOWN is the best choice, as it avoids immediate collisions and positions the snake to reach the apple at (6, 1) in subsequent moves.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\n########\n#     A#\n#   A  #\n# SS   #\n# S    #\n# SS   #\n#A H   #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Snake Position**: The snake's head ('H') is at (row 6, column 3).

Reversing direction (to UP) is invalid.\n- **Possible Directions**: LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. However, moving DOWN would collide with the bottom wall (row 7 is a wall), so DOWN is invalid. Thus, only LEFT or RIGHT are valid.\n- **Apples**: Apples ('A') are at (1,6), (2,3), and (6,1).\n\n### Analysis of Valid Directions:\n1. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (6,2). This position is empty (not a wall or body segment), so it is safe. After moving LEFT, the snake’s new direction is LEFT. In the next step, moving LEFT again would reach (6,1), which contains an apple. Eating this apple would grow the snake and increase the score.\n2. **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (6,4). This position is empty (safe), but the next moves in this direction (e.g., RIGHT again) lead to empty spaces, moving the snake away from apples.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving LEFT allows the snake to safely approach the apple at (6,1) in the next epoch, making it the optimal choice.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","\n\n########\n#     A#\n#   A  #\n# S    #\n# S    #\n# SS   #\n#AHS   #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n1. **Current Snake Position**: The snake's head ('H') is at (row 6, column 2).

The snake cannot reverse direction (so RIGHT is invalid).\n3. **Possible Moves**: LEFT, UP, DOWN (RIGHT is reversed and invalid).\n   - **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (6,2) leads to (6,1), which contains an apple ('A'). This is safe (no collision with walls or self), and eating the apple increases the score and snake length.\n   - **UP**: Moving UP from (6,2) leads to (5,2), which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This causes a self-collision, ending the game.\n   - **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (6,2) leads to (7,2), which is a wall ('#').

Collision with the wall ends the game. Invalid.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT would take the head to (5,2), which is occupied by the snake's body (S). Collision with itself ends the game. Invalid.  \n- **DOWN**: Reversing direction (current direction is UP, so DOWN is a reverse). Not allowed. Invalid.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP takes the head to (4,1).

The snake's head is at (row 4, column 1), moving UP. The snake cannot reverse direction (so DOWN is invalid), leaving UP, LEFT, or RIGHT as options. \n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **LEFT Direction**: Moving LEFT would take the head to (4, 0), which is a wall (row 4 starts with '#'), causing an immediate collision. **LEFT is invalid**.\n2. **UP Direction**: Moving UP takes the head to (3, 1), an empty space (no collision). However, this does not reach an apple immediately, and future movement toward the top wall (row 0) risks collision.\n3. **RIGHT Direction**: Moving RIGHT takes the head to (4, 2), an empty space (no collision with walls or the snake's body). This direction allows the snake to approach the apple at (5, 4) (row 5, column 4) in subsequent moves:\n   - After moving RIGHT to (4, 2), the snake can continue RIGHT to (4, 3), (4, 4), then DOWN to (5, 4), where the apple is located. This path avoids collisions with the snake's body (which occupies (5, 1-3) and (6, 1-3)) and the walls.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT is safe, avoids immediate collisions, and positions the snake to reach an apple at (5, 4) in future steps. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\n########\n#     A#\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#SH    #\n#S SA  #\n#SSS   #\n########\n\nTo determine the optimal direction, we analyze the current game state:\n\n### Snake Position & Board Details:\n- **Head (H)**: At (row 4, column 2).\n- **Body (S)**: Segments at (4,1), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3).\n- **Apples (A)**: At (1,6), (2,4), (5,4).\n- **Current Direction**: RIGHT (snake cannot reverse to LEFT).\n- **Goal**: Move safely toward apples to maximize score.\n\n### Possible Directions:\n1. **RIGHT (Current Direction)**:  \n   The head moves from (4,2) to (4,3).

UP is invalid (reverse).\n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n1. **DOWN**:  \n   Moving DOWN would take the head to (5,5) (row 5, column 5). This position is empty (safe). From (5,5), the snake could then turn LEFT to reach (5,4) (the apple) in the next move.  \n\n2. **LEFT**:  \n   Moving LEFT would take the head to (4,4) (row 4, column 4).

The snake's head is at (row 5, column 4), moving in the DOWN direction. The snake cannot reverse direction (UP is invalid). The goals are to avoid collisions (walls\/self) and reach apples ('A').\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Apple Positions**: Apples are at (1,1), (3,4), and (6,2). The closest accessible apple is at (6,2) (row 6, column 2).\n2. **Current Head Position**: (5,4). Possible moves (excluding UP) are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n3. **Collision Checks**:\n   - **DOWN**: Moves head to (6,4) (empty space, no collision).\n   - **LEFT**: Moves head to (5,3) (empty space, no collision).\n   - **RIGHT**: Moves head to (5,5) (empty space, no collision), but further from the nearest apple.\n\n### Path to Apple (6,2):\n- **DOWN → LEFT → LEFT**: Moving DOWN first (to (6,4)) positions the head in row 6 (same row as the apple). Subsequent LEFT moves (to (6,3) then (6,2)) reach the apple safely.\n- **LEFT → LEFT → DOWN**: Moving LEFT first (to (5,3) then (5,2)) positions the head in column 2 (same column as the apple). A subsequent DOWN move (to (6,2)) reaches the apple, but this path requires more directional changes.\n\n### Optimal Choice:\nMoving DOWN aligns with the snake's current direction, maintains momentum, and positions the head closer to the apple in row 6. This path avoids unnecessary directional changes and safely navigates toward the nearest apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# A  SS#\n#  SSSS#\n#  SSAS#\n#    SS#\n#    S #\n#  A H #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at (6,5) (row 6, column 5), and the current direction is DOWN.

Valid options are LEFT, UP, or DOWN.  \n\n### Analysis of Each Direction:\n- **LEFT**: Moving left from (6,3) leads to (6,2). Checking row 6: \"#  AHS #\", (6,2) is an apple 'A'. Eating this apple increases the score and grows the snake. The new position (6,2) is within the board (not a wall) and not occupied by the snake's body (body segments are at (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,2-5), (1,4-5), (3,2)). No collision occurs.  \n- **UP**: Moving up from (6,3) leads to (5,3). Row 5: \"#    S #\", (5,3) is empty (no apple, no collision). This is safe but does not increase the score.  \n- **DOWN**: Moving down from (6,3) leads to (7,3), which is a wall ('#').

The snake cannot reverse direction (e.g., cannot turn to RIGHT).\n- **Collision Risks**: \n  - **Walls**: The edges of the board (columns 0 and 6, rows 0 and 7) are walls. Moving DOWN from the head (row 6, column 2) would lead to row 7 (a wall), causing an immediate collision. Thus, DOWN is invalid.\n  - **Self-Collision**: The snake’s body ('S') occupies positions (1,4), (1,5), (2,2)-(2,5), (3,2), (3,5), (4,4)-(4,5), (5,4), (6,3)-(6,4). Moving LEFT to (6,1) or UP to (5,2) avoids these positions.\n- **Apples**: Apples ('A') are at (1,1), (3,3), and (3,4).\n\n### Direction Analysis:\n1. **LEFT**: Moving LEFT from (6,2) leads to (6,1), which is empty (no wall, no body, no apple). This is safe. After moving LEFT, the snake can later turn UP to navigate toward the apple at (1,1) (a viable path: (6,1) → (5,1) → (4,1) → (3,1) → (2,1) → (1,1)).\n2. **UP**: Moving UP from (6,2) leads to (5,2), which is empty. However, continuing UP from (5,2) would reach (4,2) (safe), but the next move UP would reach (3,2), which is part of the snake’s body (collision). This path is blocked.\n3. **DOWN**: Moving DOWN leads to (7,2), a wall (instant collision).

Moving DOWN would take the head to (7, 1), which is also a wall (collision).

Possible directions are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. \n\n### Analysis of Possible Directions:\n1. **UP**: The head would move to (row 4, column 2), which is empty (no collision with walls or body). This is safe but does not immediately lead toward the nearest apple.\n2. **LEFT**: The head would move to (row 5, column 1), which is empty. This is safe but leads toward the apple at (row 1, column 1), which is farther (Manhattan distance 5).\n3. **RIGHT**: The head would move to (row 5, column 3), which is empty. This is safe and positions the snake closer to the nearest apple at (row 3, column 3) (Manhattan distance 3). From (row 5, column 3), moving UP twice would reach (row 3, column 3) (an apple) in the next two epochs.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving RIGHT is optimal as it positions the snake to reach the nearest apple (at (3,3)) most efficiently.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# A  SS#\n#    SS#\n#   AAS#\n#    SS#\n# SH S #\n# SSSS #\n########\n\nTo determine the best direction, we analyze the snake's current position, direction, and potential collisions. The snake's head ('H') is at row 5, column 3. The current direction is RIGHT, so reversing to LEFT is invalid. We evaluate UP, DOWN, and RIGHT:\n\n- **DOWN**: Moving DOWN from (5,3) leads to row 6, column 3, which is occupied by the snake's body ('S'). This causes a collision, so DOWN is invalid.  \n- **RIGHT**: Moving RIGHT from (5,3) leads to row 5, column 4 (empty space). However, the next move in this direction would quickly hit the snake's body (row 5, column 5 is 'S'), making this path risky.  \n- **UP**: Moving UP from (5,3) leads to row 4, column 3 (empty space). From here, the next move UP would reach row 3, column 3, which contains an apple ('A'). This allows the snake to eat the apple, grow, and avoid collisions.  \n\nThus, the safest and most beneficial direction is UP. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# A  SS#\n#     S#\n#   AAS#\n#  H SS#\n# SS S #\n# SSSS #\n########\n\nThe snake's head is at position (4,2) (row 4, column 2), and the current direction is UP.

Checking the board, (3,2) is empty (no wall or snake body). This move is safe. After moving up, the head is one step closer to the apples at (3,3) and (3,4) in row 3, allowing a potential right turn to reach an apple in the next step.\n\n2. **LEFT**: The next head position would be (4,1). This cell is empty and safe. However, (4,1) is near the snake's body in row 5 (positions (5,1) and (5,2)), increasing the risk of collision in future moves if the snake continues left or down.\n\n3. **RIGHT**: The next head position would be (4,3). This cell is empty and safe. While moving right could lead to the apple at (3,3) in the next step (by moving up), the current direction (UP) already aligns with approaching the apples in row 3, making UP a more natural and direct path.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMoving UP keeps the snake on a safe trajectory toward the nearest apples (at (3,3) and (3,4)) without unnecessary turns, minimizing collision risk. \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n# A   S#\n#     S#\n#  HAAS#\n#  S SS#\n# SS S #\n# SSSS #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is located at position (row 3, column 2).

The current direction is RIGHT, so the snake cannot reverse to LEFT. We need to evaluate possible directions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) for safety and apple consumption:\n\n### 1. Direction: DOWN  \nMoving DOWN from (6, 4) would take the head to (7, 4). Row 7 is a wall (all '#'), so this causes a wall collision. **DOWN is invalid.**\n\n### 2. Direction: RIGHT  \nMoving RIGHT from (6, 4) leads to (6, 5), which contains an apple ('A'). This position is within the board (not a wall) and not part of the snake's body (current body segments are at (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)). Eating this apple is safe and increases the score.  \n\n### 3. Direction: UP  \nMoving UP from (6, 4) leads to (5, 4), which also contains an apple ('A'). This position is within the board (not a wall) and not part of the snake's body (row 5's body segment is only at (5,1)). Eating this apple is safe and increases the score.  \n\n### Comparison of Valid Directions (RIGHT vs. UP)  \nBoth RIGHT and UP allow the snake to eat an apple. However, moving UP to (5, 4) positions the snake to potentially eat another apple at (4, 4) in the next move (by continuing UP), enabling efficient apple consumption. In contrast, moving RIGHT to (6, 5) would require additional steps to reach the remaining apples. Thus, UP is more optimal.  \n\nAnswer: UP","\n\nThe current game board is:\n########\n#SSSSSA#\n#SS  S #\n#SSSSS #\n#S  A  #\n#S  H  #\n#SSSSA #\n########\n\nThe snake's head (H) is at position (row 5, column 4).

The goal of the game is to control the snake, eat as many apples as possible, and grow the snake in length. Each time the snake eats an apple, the score increases by one. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point.
