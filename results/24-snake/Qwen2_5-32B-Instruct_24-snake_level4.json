The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point. The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# AA   #\n#     H#\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 4\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n"],"action":"RIGHT","response":["########\n#      #\n#      #\n# AA   #\n#  H   #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# AA   #\n#   H  #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven that the snake is currently moving to the right, and there is no obstacle or wall immediately to the right of the snake's head, the optimal move would be to continue moving right towards the apple. There is no immediate danger of collision with the snake's body since it has just started, and there are no other parts of the snake's body yet.\n\nTherefore, the direction to move is: RIGHT\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#      #\n# AA   #\n#    H #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the current board and the fact that the snake is moving to the right, there are no immediate obstacles for the snake to move right until it reaches the wall or an apple. However, since the snake can't reverse its direction, we need to plan ahead to avoid any potential collision with itself or the wall. At this stage, the snake hasn't grown long enough to cause such a situation, but we need to be mindful of future growth.\n\nSince the snake is currently heading right and there's an apple at the position it will reach in two steps, the best action would be to continue moving right to eat the apple and grow. After eating the apple, the snake will grow, so it's important to keep an eye on the next steps to avoid collision.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#      #\n# AA   #\n#     H#\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the current game board and the fact that the snake is moving to the right, the snake will not encounter any obstacles or apples in the immediate next move. Therefore, there is no need to change the direction yet. However, since the snake is moving towards the edge of the board, we must prepare for the snake to turn before it hits the wall.\n\nGiven the current setup, the best move would be to continue moving right until the snake is one step away from the wall, then turn up to avoid hitting the wall and to potentially move towards an apple.\n\nSince the snake is currently moving right and has not yet reached the position where it needs to turn, the direction remains:\n\nAnswer: RIGHT"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point.

Thus, the best option here is to move 'LEFT' to eat the apple and grow the snake.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#    A #\n# H  A #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#H   A #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the current game board and the fact that the snake is moving to the LEFT, the best immediate move would be to continue moving LEFT to avoid any collisions and position the snake to eat the closest apple. However, since the snake can't reverse direction and the current direction is LEFT, we'll keep the direction as LEFT for this step.\n\nAnswer: LEFT"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

However, moving 'LEFT' would allow the snake to eat an apple and grow, which is beneficial. Moving 'RIGHT' would also be safe but does not lead to an immediate reward.

Since there is no immediate danger of collision and the snake can grow by eating the apple, the optimal direction remains 'LEFT'.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","The current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#H  A  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven the current direction is LEFT, moving left would lead the snake into the wall, which would end the game. Therefore, we need to choose another direction to avoid this collision. Considering the position of the apples and the current orientation, moving DOWN towards an apple seems like a safe and beneficial move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","The current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#S AA  #\n#H     #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven the current direction is DOWN and the current epoch is 4, the optimal move would be to continue moving DOWN towards one of the apples.

Therefore, we need to change direction to avoid this collision. Since the snake is currently moving upwards, we can either move left or right.

However, since there are no obstacles or apples immediately to the right of the snake's head, the snake will simply move one step to the right without any change in score or length. \n\nTherefore, the best action here would be to continue moving RIGHT since there are no immediate actions needed to avoid collision or to eat an apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","The current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#    H #\n#      #\n#      #\n#AA    #\n#A     #\n########\n\nBased on the current game board and the fact that the snake is moving to the right, the snake will not encounter any obstacles or apples within the immediate vicinity if it continues moving right.

The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point.

The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point.

Since the snake's head is located at the second row from the top and there is an apple two spaces above it, continuing to move 'UP' would result in the snake hitting the wall and losing the game. Therefore, the best option here would be to change the direction to either 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT' to avoid the wall and continue the game. However, since the goal is to eat as many apples as possible, we should consider the position of the apples. There are apples to the right of the snake, so moving 'RIGHT' seems to be the most beneficial move as it will allow the snake to eventually reach an apple without immediately causing a loss.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#  A   #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the current game board and the current direction, the best move to continue eating apples without hitting the wall or itself would be to continue moving RIGHT until it reaches the apple.

This will allow the snake to grow and avoid any potential collisions with walls or itself.\n\nAnswer: UP","The current game board is:\n\n########  \n#      #  \n# A    #  \n#  H   #  \n#  S A #  \n# A    #  \n#      #  \n########  \n\nGiven the current direction is 'UP', moving up from the current position will lead the snake to eat an apple located directly above it. This action will increase the score by 1 and extend the snake's length by 1 unit. Since the snake cannot reverse its direction, the valid directions for the next move would be either 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT'.\n\nAfter moving 'UP', the new game board will look like this:\n\n########  \n#  H    #  \n# AS   #  \n#  S   #  \n#  S A #  \n# A    #  \n#      #  \n########  \n\nTo continue the game without hitting any obstacles or itself, the best immediate direction seems to be 'LEFT', as it allows the snake to move towards another apple while avoiding a potential collision with the wall or its own body.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n# A    #\n# HS   #\n#    A #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the current game state and the fact that the snake is moving to the LEFT, the best immediate move would be to continue moving LEFT to avoid any collision and to position for future apple consumption. However, since the snake is already at the leftmost position with an apple directly in front of it, continuing LEFT would result in a wall collision. Thus, the optimal move here would be to turn UP towards the apple above.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n# H    #\n#ASS   #\n#    A #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nIn this situation, since the snake is currently moving UP and there is no obstacle directly above it, the best move would be to continue in the same direction to avoid any immediate danger and keep the options open for eating an apple. However, since the snake cannot reverse direction, the only valid directions from UP are LEFT or RIGHT. Given that there is an apple directly to the right of the snake's head, the optimal direction to move towards is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n# SH   #\n#AS    #\n#    A #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven the current game board and the current direction (RIGHT), the best move for the snake to eat an apple and avoid collision would be to continue moving RIGHT. Since the snake is moving to the right and there is no immediate obstacle, moving RIGHT will lead the snake towards an apple without causing a collision.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","The current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n# SSH  #\n#A     #\n#    A #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the current game state and the rule that the snake is moving to the right, the best move would be to continue moving 'RIGHT' to approach the nearest apple without hitting any walls or itself. There are no immediate obstacles to the right, so maintaining the current direction is optimal for now.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#  SSH #\n#A     #\n#    A #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nGiven the current direction is RIGHT, and the snake is about to move towards the right, it will not encounter an apple or itself immediately. However, continuing in this direction will eventually lead the snake into a collision with the wall since there are no turns available to avoid it. Therefore, the best action would be to change the direction to DOWN before the snake hits the wall.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","The current game board is:\n\n########\n#      #\n#   SS #\n#A   H #\n#    A #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the given board and the current direction (DOWN), the optimal move would be to continue moving DOWN towards the nearest apple without risking collision with the snake's body or the walls. Therefore, the direction to give is:\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#    A #\n#   SS #\n#A   S #\n#    H #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\nBased on the current game board and the fact that the snake is currently moving DOWN, the optimal move would be to continue moving DOWN to avoid any immediate collision with the wall or itself, and also to position the snake for potentially eating the apple below it in the next move. Therefore, the direction should remain:\n\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#    A #\n#    S #\n#A   S #\n#    S #\n# A  H #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n#A   S #\n#    S #\n# A  S #\n#    H #\n########\n\nBased on the current game state and the fact that the snake is moving DOWN, the best immediate action would be to continue moving DOWN towards an apple without hitting any walls or itself. However, since the snake cannot reverse direction, we need to plan ahead to avoid a collision with its own body or the wall once it reaches the bottom.\n\nGiven the current position and the next step, moving DOWN would place the snake's head over an apple, increasing the score by 1 and growing the snake. After this move, the snake would be in a position where it could potentially turn RIGHT to continue eating apples without immediately running into itself or the wall.\n\nTherefore, for the next step, the direction should remain DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.
