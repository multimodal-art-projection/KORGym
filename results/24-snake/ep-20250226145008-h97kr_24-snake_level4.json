The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#    SH#\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 7\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n"],"action":"RIGHT","response":["########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#  A   #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\nAccording to the current game board and the snake's current moving direction ('UP'), moving 'UP' will make the snake move towards the apple above.

Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point. The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#  SS  #\n# ASH  #\n#  S   #\n#      #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 8\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n"],"action":"LEFT","response":["########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n# AH   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\nIf the snake is currently moving 'UP', and we want to eat an apple, the best move is to go 'LEFT' as there is an apple to the left of the snake's head.\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n# HS   #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n########\nThe snake is currently moving left.

The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point. The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#   A  #\n#S   A #\n#H     #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 8\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n"],"action":"LEFT","response":["########\n#  AA  #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\nTo eat an apple as quickly as possible, moving 'UP' is the best choice as there is an apple directly above the snake's head and the snake is already moving in the 'UP' direction and won't violate the non - reversal rule.\nAnswer: UP","########\n#  AA  #\n#    A #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\nThe snake is currently moving 'UP'.

Since the snake cannot reverse its direction and moving 'UP' is a valid move to reach an apple, the best choice is to keep moving 'UP'.\nAnswer: UP","########\n#  HA  #\n#  S A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\nIf the snake moves LEFT, it will avoid hitting the wall and itself and may move towards an apple in the future. Since it cannot reverse direction and moving RIGHT will not help it get to an apple more directly at this moment, and moving UP will hit the wall. So the best direction is LEFT.\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n# HSA  #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\nBased on the current situation, if the snake is moving LEFT currently, turning RIGHT is not allowed as it's a direct reversal. Turning UP or DOWN will lead the snake towards open spaces but there is an apple in the left direction. So, the best move is to continue moving LEFT to eat the apple.\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#HS A  #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\nIf the snake is currently moving LEFT, to avoid hitting the wall and to reach an apple, the best move is DOWN. This way, the snake can move towards the apples on the board without colliding with the wall or itself.\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#S  A  #\n#H   A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN. To reach an apple and considering it can't reverse direction, moving DOWN seems like a good option as there is an apple in that general direction.\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#   A  #\n#S   A #\n#H     #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN. Looking at the board, moving DOWN will lead the snake to an empty space. Moving LEFT will also lead to an empty space. Moving RIGHT is blocked by the snake's body, so it's not a valid move. Moving UP is reversing the current direction, which is not allowed. Since we want to get closer to the apples, moving LEFT can potentially bring the snake closer to the apples on the board.\nAnswer: LEFT"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

To reach an apple, moving RIGHT is a good choice as there is an apple on the right side of the snake's head and it doesn't violate the non - reversal rule.\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#      #\n#  SH  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\nIf the snake is currently moving RIGHT and we give the direction DOWN, it will move safely towards an apple.\nThe next state of the board would be like this:\n########\n#      #\n#  S   #\n#A SH  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#      #\n#   S  #\n#A  H  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\nIf the snake is currently moving DOWN, and we want to avoid hitting the wall and reach an apple, the best next direction is LEFT.

So the direction I choose is UP.\nAnswer: UP","########\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#A S   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\nThe snake is currently moving 'UP'. If it continues moving 'UP', it will move into an empty space. Looking at the board, if the snake turns 'LEFT', it will be able to reach an apple in the next move. Also, turning 'LEFT' is a valid move as it doesn't reverse the current direction.\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#      #\n# HS   #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT.

Moving LEFT will not cause a collision with the wall or itself and there is a chance to reach an apple in the future. Also, according to the rule that the snake cannot reverse its direction, we cannot choose UP. Moving RIGHT will lead the snake closer to the wall quickly and may not be the best option. So, the better direction is LEFT.\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#    A #\n# S    #\n#HS    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT. Since it can't reverse its direction, we can't choose RIGHT. Looking at the board, if we choose UP, the snake will move towards an apple. This is a good move as it can increase the score.\nAnswer: UP","########\n#    A #\n#H     #\n#SS    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\nThe snake is currently moving UP. To reach the nearest apple, moving UP seems to be a good choice as it is in the direction of the apple in the top - right part of the board. Also, we need to avoid hitting the walls or the snake's body. Since moving UP does not violate the non - reversal rule and can lead us to an apple, the direction should be UP.\nAnswer: UP","########\n#H   A #\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\nTo eat an apple quickly, since the snake is currently moving 'UP' and there is an apple to the right of the snake's head, the best direction to move is 'RIGHT'.\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#SH  A #\n#S     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\nSince the snake is currently moving RIGHT and cannot reverse its direction, and moving RIGHT will lead the snake to an empty space without hitting the wall or itself.

There is no need to change the direction as this is the most straightforward way to eat an apple.\nAnswer: RIGHT","########\n#A     #\n#      #\n# A  A #\n#    SH#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\nThe snake is currently moving RIGHT. If it continues moving RIGHT, it will not eat an apple in the next move. Moving LEFT is not allowed as it's the reverse direction. Moving UP, the snake will reach a square with an apple ('A'). So, the best move is UP.\nAnswer: UP","########\n#A     #\n#      #\n# A  AH#\n#     S#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\nThe snake is currently moving 'UP'. To eat an apple without reversing direction, moving 'LEFT' is a good choice as there is an apple to the left of the snake's head. If we move left, we can eat the apple and increase the score.\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#A     #\n# A    #\n# A  HS#\n#     S#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT. It cannot reverse direction, so it can't move RIGHT. Looking at the board, if it moves UP, it will move towards the apples and avoid hitting the wall or itself. \nAnswer: UP","########\n#A     #\n# A  H #\n# A  SS#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\nI choose 'LEFT'. If the snake moves left, it will eat an apple, increase the score by 1, and grow in length. The next state of the board might be something like this (the body part 'S' will extend accordingly):\n########\n#A     #\n# AH SS#\n#  A SS#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#A     #\n# A HS #\n# A  S #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT. If it continues moving LEFT, it will hit the wall. Since it can't reverse its direction (so it can't go RIGHT), and there is an apple above it. So, the best move is to go UP.\nAnswer: UP","########\n#A  H  #\n# A SS #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\nTo eat an apple and increase the score, the best move is to go LEFT as there is an apple on the left of the snake's head.\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#A HS  #\n# A S  #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT. To eat an apple, moving DOWN would be a good choice as it can reach an apple. And since it's moving LEFT, turning DOWN is a valid move as it doesn't reverse the direction.\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#A SS  #\n# AH   #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN. To reach an apple, moving LEFT would be a good choice as there is an apple to the left of the snake's head. Also, moving LEFT does not violate the rule of not reversing the direction.\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#A SS  #\n# HS   #\n# A    #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\nIf the snake is currently moving LEFT, it can't move RIGHT as it can't reverse its direction. Moving UP will make it hit the snake's body. Moving DOWN is a valid option that won't lead to a collision and might help the snake reach an apple in the future.\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#A SS  #\n#ASS   #\n# H    #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN. To reach an apple and avoid hitting the walls or itself, moving LEFT seems like a good option as there is an apple in that direction and it doesn't violate the non - reversal rule.\nAnswer: LEFT","########\n#A S   #\n#ASS   #\n#HS    #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\nSince the snake is currently moving LEFT and cannot reverse its direction, to reach the nearest apple which is below the snake's head, we should turn DOWN.\nAnswer: DOWN","########\n#A     #\n#ASS   #\n#SS    #\n#H A   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\nBased on the current situation, if the snake is moving DOWN currently, turning LEFT will make it get closer to the apple on the left. And it doesn't violate the rule of not reversing the direction. So the next direction should be LEFT.\nAnswer: LEFT"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER' (without quotes), where YOUR_ANSWER is your final answer to the question,e.g.'Answer: LEFT'\n\nYou are controlling a snake in a Snake game.The board size is 8x8.In the game board. The goal of the game is to control the snake, eat as many apples as possible, and grow the snake in length. Each time the snake eats an apple, the score increases by one. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point. The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n# SSA  #\n#HS  A #\n#SS    #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 34\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","epoch":34}
