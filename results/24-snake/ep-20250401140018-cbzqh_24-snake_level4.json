Possible moves: UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT\n\nLooking at possible moves:\n- LEFT: Would move to (4,2) - empty space (safe)\n- UP: Would move to (3,3) - empty space (safe)\n- DOWN: Would move to (5,3) - empty space (safe)\n\nBest move would be to go for the nearest apple at (4,1) by moving LEFT twice, but since we can only choose one move at a time, LEFT is the best immediate choice to get closer to that apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Let me analyze the current game board and situation:\n\nCurrent game board:\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#HSS   #\n# A    #\n#A     #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 3\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

Moving LEFT would take the head to (5, 1), which is the snake's body 'S', causing a collision and ending the game.\n6. Moving RIGHT would take the head to (5, 3), which is an apple 'A', so the snake would eat the apple, grow in length, and increase the score by 1.\n\nSince the current direction is DOWN, the snake cannot reverse to UP.

Turning LEFT is valid because it is not a direct reversal of the current UP direction (which would be DOWN). \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# H    #\n#AA    #\n#A     #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 2\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT, and its head ('H') is at position (4, 2) (assuming rows and columns are 0-indexed). The possible moves are LEFT, UP, or DOWN (since RIGHT would reverse the current direction, which is not allowed). \n\nLooking at the board:\n- Moving LEFT would take the snake to (4, 1), which is empty. This is safe but doesn't eat an apple.\n- Moving UP would take the snake to (3, 2), which is empty. This is safe but doesn't eat an apple.\n- Moving DOWN would take the snake to (5, 2), where there is an apple ('A'). This would eat the apple, increase the score, and grow the snake.\n\nThe best move is DOWN to eat the apple and grow the snake.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Let me analyze the current game board and situation:\n\nCurrent game board:\n########\n# A    #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S    #\n#AH    #\n#A     #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 3\n\nAnalysis:\n1. The snake's head ('H') is at position (5,6) [row 5, column 6]\n2. The snake's body ('S') is at (4,3) and (5,5)\n3. There are apples ('A') at:\n   - (1,3)\n   - (5,2)\n   - (6,2)\n4. Current direction is DOWN, so we cannot choose UP as our next move (would be reversing direction)\n5. Possible moves: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN\n\nBest move considerations:\n- Moving DOWN would take us to (6,6) which is empty (safe)\n- Moving LEFT would take us to (5,5) which is our own body (collision - game over)\n- Moving RIGHT would take us to (5,7) which is a wall (collision - game over)\n\nTherefore, the only safe move is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Let me analyze the current game board and situation:\n\nCurrent game board:\n########\n# A    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#AS    #\n#AH    #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 4\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

Moving LEFT would make us eat the apple at (5,2) and grow longer\n7. Moving DOWN would make us hit the wall at the bottom (row 7 is all walls)\n8. Moving RIGHT would take us away from both apples\n\nBest move: LEFT\n- This will make us eat the apple at (5,2)\n- It's a valid move (not reversing direction)\n- It avoids hitting the wall\n- It grows our snake\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n# A    #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#AS    #\n#HS    #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 5\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT, with its head at position (6, 2) (assuming rows and columns are 0-indexed). The body segment is at (6, 3). There are two apples on the board: one at (1, 2) and another at (2, 5).\n\nPossible moves:\n1. LEFT: Not allowed (would collide with the body segment at (6, 3)).\n2. RIGHT: Allowed (would move to (6, 1)).\n3. UP: Allowed (would move to (5, 2)).\n4. DOWN: Not allowed (would collide with the wall at the bottom).\n\nSince the snake cannot reverse direction (LEFT to RIGHT directly is not allowed), the only valid moves are UP or RIGHT. However, moving RIGHT would take the snake away from the apple at (1, 2), while moving UP would bring it closer to the apple at (2, 5) in the long run. \n\nThe best move is UP to avoid collision and position the snake for future apple consumption.\n\nAnswer: UP","Let me analyze the current game board and situation:\n\nCurrent game board:\n########\n# A    #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#HS    #\n#SS    #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 6\n\nSnake position analysis:\n- Head (H) is at (5,2) [row 5, column 2]\n- Body parts:\n  - S at (5,1)\n  - S at (6,1)\n  - S at (6,2)\n\nPossible moves from current UP direction:\n1.

Moving RIGHT is safe and continues the current direction. Moving UP would take the head to (3, 5), which is empty, and moving DOWN would take it to (5, 5), which is also empty. \n\nThe best move is to continue RIGHT to avoid unnecessary turns and keep the path open for future moves. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Let me analyze the current game board and situation:\n\nCurrent Game Board:\n########\n#A     #\n# A    #\n#  A   #\n#   SH #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 3\n\nAnalysis:\n1. The snake's head ('H') is at position (4,5) and its body ('S') is at (4,4)\n2.

The body 'S' is to the right of the head at (4, 6). There are apples ('A') at positions (2, 2), (3, 3), and (4, 4). \n\nPossible moves:\n1. Continue LEFT: The head would move to (4, 4), where there is an apple. This would allow the snake to eat the apple, grow in length, and increase the score by 1.\n2. Turn UP: This would move the head to (3, 5), which is empty. No apple would be eaten.\n3. Turn DOWN: This would move the head to (5, 5), which is empty. No apple would be eaten.\n\nThe best move is to continue LEFT to eat the apple at (4, 4).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","The current game board is:\n\n########\n#A     #\n# A    #\n#  HSS #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 6\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT. The possible directions to turn are UP or DOWN (since LEFT is the current direction and RIGHT is a direct reverse, which is not allowed). \n\nLooking at the board:\n- If the snake moves UP, it will hit the wall ('#') and lose the game.\n- If the snake moves DOWN, it will move into an empty space and continue safely.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to avoid collision and continue the game.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n# A    #\n#  SS  #\n#  H A #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 7\n\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN, and its head ('H') is at position (4, 3). The possible directions to avoid collision and eat apples are:\n1. LEFT: This would move the head to (4, 2), which is currently occupied by 'S' (snake body), leading to a collision and game over.\n2. RIGHT: This would move the head to (4, 4), which is currently occupied by 'A' (apple). This is a valid move and would allow the snake to eat the apple, grow in length, and increase the score by 1.\n3. UP: This would reverse the current direction (DOWN), which is not allowed.\n4. DOWN: This would move the head to (5, 3), which is empty. This is a valid move but does not eat an apple.\n\nThe best move is RIGHT to eat the apple and avoid collision.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Let me analyze the current game board and situation:\n\nCurrent game board:\n########\n#A     #\n# A    #\n#  S   #\n#  SHA #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 8\n\nAnalysis:\n1. Snake position: The head 'H' is at (4,4) (row,column), moving RIGHT\n2. Snake body: 'S' at (4,3), 'S' at (4,2), 'A' at (4,5) (this is actually an apple that will be eaten if we continue RIGHT)\n3. Apples: \n   - At (1,2)\n   - At (2,3)\n   - At (4,5) (will be eaten if we continue RIGHT)\n\nPossible moves:\n- Cannot go LEFT (reverse of RIGHT)\n- Can go UP or DOWN (RIGHT is also possible but would eat the apple at (4,5))\n\nBest move:\nGoing RIGHT would eat the apple at (4,5), increasing our score and length. This is the optimal move as it:\n1. Gains us a point\n2. Doesn't risk collision (the space is currently occupied by an apple, not a wall or body)\n3. Keeps us moving toward other apples on the board\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n# A    #\n#  S  A#\n#  SSH #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 9\n\nAnalysis:\n1. The snake's head ('H') is at position (4, 5) (row 4, column 5, 0-indexed).\n2. The current direction is RIGHT, so the next position is (4, 6).\n3. The cell at (4, 6) is empty, so the snake will move forward without eating an apple.\n4. Since the snake cannot reverse direction (LEFT is invalid), the possible moves are RIGHT, UP, or DOWN.\n5. Moving RIGHT again would continue the current path, but there is an apple ('A') at (3, 6), so turning UP might be a good strategy to target that apple soon.\n6. Moving DOWN would lead to (5, 5), which is empty and safe but doesn't target an apple immediately.\n\nBest move: UP to position (3, 5), which is a body segment ('S'). This would cause a collision and end the game, so this is invalid.\nNext best move: RIGHT to (4, 6), which is safe but doesn't target an apple.\nAlternative: DOWN to (5, 5), which is safe but not optimal.\n\nSince UP is invalid (collision), RIGHT is the safest continuation.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n#  SSSH#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 10\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is at position (4, 7) (assuming rows and columns are 1-indexed), moving RIGHT. The body ('S') extends to the left of the head. The possible directions to avoid reversing are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (since LEFT would reverse the current RIGHT direction, which is not allowed). \n\nLooking at the board:\n- Moving RIGHT would cause the snake to collide with the wall ('#') at (4, 8), ending the game.\n- Moving UP would take the head to (3, 7), which is empty (' '), so this is safe.\n- Moving DOWN would take the head to (5, 7), which is also empty (' '), so this is safe.\n\nThe best move is to go UP to avoid the wall and potentially position the snake closer to the apples at (1, 2) or (2, 3). \n\nAnswer: UP","Let me analyze the current game board and situation:\n\nCurrent game board:\n########\n#A     #\n# AA   #\n#     H#\n#  SSSS#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 11\n\nAnalysis:\n1. The snake's head ('H') is at position (3,6) (row 3, column 6)\n2. The snake's body ('S') forms a line to the left of the head in row 4\n3. Current direction is UP, so possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or continuing UP (can't go DOWN as that would reverse direction)\n4. Apples ('A') are at positions: (1,1), (2,2), (2,3), and possibly others not visible in this view\n\nPossible moves:\n- UP: Would move head to (2,6) - empty space, safe\n- LEFT: Would move head to (3,5) - empty space, safe\n- RIGHT: Would move head to (3,7) - wall ('#'), would lose\n\nBest move:\n- Moving LEFT would position the snake better to potentially reach the apple at (2,3) in future moves\n- Moving UP is also safe but doesn't position us as well for future apple collection\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n# AA   #\n#    HS#\n#   SSS#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

The possible moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (since LEFT would reverse the current direction, which is not allowed). \n\nLooking at the board:\n- Moving RIGHT would take the head to (4, 5), which is empty, so the snake would move forward without eating an apple.\n- Moving UP would take the head to (3, 4), which is empty.\n- Moving DOWN would take the head to (5, 4), which is empty.\n\nThe closest apple is at (1, 5) and (1, 6), but they are quite far. The apple at (7, 6) is also far. Since none of the apples are immediately accessible, the best strategy is to continue moving RIGHT to explore the board and avoid turning unnecessarily.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n\n########\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#   SH #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 8\n\nThe snake is currently moving RIGHT, and its head 'H' is at position (4, 5) (assuming rows and columns are 1-indexed). The body 'S' is at (4, 4). The possible directions to move are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (since LEFT would reverse the direction, which is not allowed). \n\nLooking at the board:\n- Moving RIGHT would move the head to (4, 6), which is empty, so the snake would move forward without eating an apple.\n- Moving UP would move the head to (3, 5), which is empty.\n- Moving DOWN would move the head to (5, 5), which is empty.\n\nThere is an apple 'A' at (1, 5), but it is not reachable in one move. The closest apple is at (1, 6), but it is also not reachable in one move. \n\nSince no apple can be eaten in this move, the best strategy is to continue moving RIGHT to keep the snake aligned for future moves toward the apple at (1, 6) or (7, 6).\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Let me analyze the current game board and situation:\n\nCurrent game board:\n########\n#   AA #\n#      #\n#    SH#\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 9\n\nAnalysis:\n1. The snake's head (H) is at position (3,5) and its body (S) is at (3,6)\n2. Current direction is RIGHT, so possible moves are RIGHT (continue forward), UP, or DOWN (can't reverse to LEFT)\n3. Apples are located at:\n   - (1,4)\n   - (1,5)\n   - (6,6)\n\nBest move considerations:\n- Moving RIGHT would continue the snake's current path but would hit the wall at (3,7)\n- Moving UP would take the head to (2,5) - empty space\n- Moving DOWN would take the head to (4,5) - empty space\n- The closest apple is at (1,4) and (1,5) above the snake\n- Moving UP would position us better to reach these apples\n\nTherefore, the best move is UP to position ourselves for the apples while avoiding immediate danger.\n\nAnswer: UP","Let me analyze the current game board and situation:\n\nCurrent game board:\n########\n#   AA #\n#     H#\n#     S#\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 10\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

Available moves: LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP\n5. Apples are at:\n   - (2,5)\n   - (2,6)\n   - (7,6)\n\nBest move considerations:\n- Moving UP would take us to (2,6) where there's an apple - this is a good immediate reward\n- Moving LEFT would take us to (3,5) - empty space\n- Moving RIGHT would take us to (3,7) which is a wall ('#') - this would end the game\n\nThe best move is UP to eat the apple at (2,6).\n\nAnswer: UP","Let me analyze the current game board and situation:\n\nCurrent game board:\n########\n#   AAH#\n#     S#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 11\n\nAnalysis:\n1. The snake's head ('H') is at position (1,6) - right side near the top\n2. The snake's body ('S') is at (2,6) - directly below the head\n3.

There are apples ('A') at:\n   - (1,4)\n   - (1,5) - adjacent to the head\n   - (6,6) - bottom right\n\nPossible moves:\n- Since current direction is UP, we cannot go DOWN (that would be a reverse)\n- We can continue UP (but that would hit the wall '#')\n- We can turn LEFT or RIGHT\n\nBest move considerations:\n1. Going UP would hit the wall - game over\n2. Going LEFT would eat the apple at (1,5) - good move\n3.

The next move to the LEFT would take the head to (1, 4), which is an empty space. The body ('S') is at (1, 6) and (2, 6). \n\nPossible directions to turn are UP or DOWN (since LEFT is the current direction and RIGHT would reverse it, which is not allowed). \n\n- If we choose UP, the head would move to (0, 5), which is a wall ('#'), causing the game to end. \n- If we choose DOWN, the head would move to (2, 5), which is an empty space and safe. \n\nThus, the best move is DOWN to avoid the wall and continue the game.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#   ASS#\n#    H #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point.

The current direction is DOWN, so the snake is moving downward. The possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (since reversing to UP is not allowed). \n\nThere is an apple ('A') directly to the left of the head (position (5, 3)) and another apple to the right (position (5, 5)).

This is invalid because (7, 5) is a wall '#'.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n1. RIGHT: Move to (6, 6). The cell (6, 6) is empty (' '), so the snake moves without eating an apple. The tail will also move forward, and the new head position will be (6, 6).\n2. UP: Move to (5, 5).

The possible directions to move are RIGHT (continue current direction), UP, or DOWN (cannot reverse to LEFT directly from RIGHT). \n\nLooking at the board:\n- Moving RIGHT would take the snake to (4, 6), which is empty (' '), so no apple is eaten, and the snake moves forward.\n- Moving UP would take the snake to (3, 5), which is empty (' '), so no apple is eaten, and the snake moves forward.\n- Moving DOWN would take the snake to (5, 5), which contains an apple ('A'), so the snake would eat the apple, grow in length, and increase the score by 1.\n\nThe best move is to go DOWN to eat the apple and grow the snake. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n# A  H #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is currently at position (4, 5) and moving DOWN. The possible directions to avoid reversing are LEFT or RIGHT (since DOWN is the current direction and UP is a direct reverse, which is not allowed). \n\nLooking at the board:\n- Moving RIGHT would take the head to (4, 6), which is empty.\n- Moving LEFT would take the head to (4, 4), where there is an apple 'A'. Eating the apple would increase the score and grow the snake.\n\nThe best move is to go LEFT to eat the apple. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Let me analyze the current game board and situation:\n\nCurrent game board:\n########\n#      #\n#  A  A#\n#      #\n# A H  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 6\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

The valid moves are LEFT, UP, or DOWN.\n- Moving LEFT will eat the apple, increasing the score and growing the snake.\n- Moving UP or DOWN would avoid the apple but are less optimal since eating the apple is the goal.\n\nBest move: LEFT to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n# AA  A#\n#      #\n# HS   #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 12\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is currently at position (4, 3) (assuming rows and columns are 1-indexed), and the body 'S' is at (4, 2). The snake is moving LEFT. The possible directions to avoid reversing are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since RIGHT would reverse the current LEFT direction).\n\nPossible moves:\n1. LEFT: The head would move to (4, 2), but this is occupied by the body 'S', which would cause a collision and end the game. This is invalid.\n2. UP: The head would move to (3, 3), which is empty. This is safe.\n3. DOWN: The head would move to (5, 3), which is empty. This is also safe.\n\nBetween UP and DOWN, moving UP would bring the snake closer to the apples at (3, 2) and (3, 3), while moving DOWN would take it away from the apples.

The possible directions to move are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (since LEFT would reverse the current direction, which is not allowed). \n\nLooking at the board, there is an apple ('A') to the RIGHT of the head at (4, 5). Moving RIGHT would allow the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score and growing in length. \n\nTherefore, the best move is to continue moving RIGHT to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Let me analyze the current game board and situation:\n\nCurrent game board:\n########\n#  AA  #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#    H #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 3\n\nAnalysis:\n1. The snake's head 'H' is at position (5,5) (row 5, column 5)\n2. The current direction is RIGHT, so the head is moving to the right\n3.

From the current position, moving UP would take the head to an empty space (no apple or wall). The possible directions to turn are LEFT or RIGHT (since reversing direction to DOWN is not allowed). \n\nLooking at the board, turning LEFT would move the head towards an apple ('A') in two steps (first move LEFT, then UP), while turning RIGHT would move the head away from the apples.

The possible directions to avoid reversing are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (but not RIGHT, as that would reverse the current LEFT direction). \n\nLooking at the board:\n- Moving LEFT would take the snake to (3, 3), which is empty (' '), so this is safe.\n- Moving UP would take the snake to (2, 4), which is empty (' '), so this is also safe.\n- Moving DOWN would take the snake to (4, 4), which is empty (' '), so this is safe as well.\n\nThe closest apple is at (2, 5) (the 'A' in the second row). To reach it efficiently:\n- Moving UP would take the head to (2, 4), which is closer to the apple at (2, 5).\n- Moving LEFT would take the head away from the apple.\n- Moving DOWN would also take the head away from the apple.\n\nThus, the best move is UP to get closer to the apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","Let me analyze the current game board and situation:\n\nCurrent game board:\n########\n#  AA  #\n#   HA #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 6\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

Eating the apple would increase the score and grow the snake's length. Since the current direction is LEFT, the snake cannot reverse to RIGHT, but it can continue LEFT (to eat the apple) or turn UP or DOWN. \n\nThe best move is to continue LEFT to eat the apple, as this will grow the snake and increase the score. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#  AHSS#\n#      #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT, and its head 'H' is at position (1, 4). The possible moves are LEFT (continuing current direction), UP, or DOWN (since reversing to RIGHT is not allowed). \n\n- Moving LEFT would cause the snake to collide with its own body ('S') at (1, 3), resulting in a game over. This is not a valid move.\n- Moving UP would take the head to (0, 4), which is a wall '#', resulting in a game over. This is not a valid move.\n- Moving DOWN would take the head to (2, 4), which is an empty space.

Since LEFT is closer to the current position of the head, it is the better choice to minimize risk.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Let me analyze the current game board and situation:\n\nCurrent game board:\n########\n#  A   #\n#   S  #\n#   S  #\n#  HSA #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 15\n\nAnalysis:\n1. The snake's head 'H' is at position (4,3) (row 4, column 3)\n2. The snake's body consists of:\n   - 'S' at (4,4)\n   - 'S' at (4,5)\n   - 'S' at (3,4)\n   - 'S' at (2,4)\n3. Apples are at:\n   - (1,3)\n   - (5,4)\n4. Current direction is LEFT, so we cannot choose RIGHT as it would be a direct reversal\n5. Possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT\n\nLooking at possible moves:\n- LEFT: Would move to (4,2) - this is a wall '#', so invalid (game over)\n- UP: Would move to (3,3) - empty space, safe\n- DOWN: Would move to (5,3) - empty space, safe\n\nBest move would be UP, as:\n1. It's safe (not hitting wall or body)\n2. It positions us closer to the apple at (1,3)\n3. It avoids the risk of getting trapped in the lower right area\n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#      #\n#  HS  #\n#  SSA #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nFrom the current board and direction, the snake's head 'H' is at position (4, 4) (assuming rows and columns are 1-indexed), and the body 'S' extends to the left. The current direction is 'UP', so the snake is moving upward. \n\nPossible moves:\n- 'UP' is the current direction, so continuing 'UP' is allowed.\n- 'LEFT' is allowed because it is not a reverse of 'UP' (reverse would be 'DOWN').\n- 'RIGHT' is allowed because it is not a reverse of 'UP'.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the best move:\n1. If we continue 'UP', the head will move to (3, 4), which is currently empty (' '). This is safe but doesn't eat an apple.\n2. If we turn 'LEFT', the head will move to (4, 3), which is currently 'S' (part of the snake's body). This would cause a collision and end the game.\n3. If we turn 'RIGHT', the head will move to (4, 5), which is currently 'S' (part of the snake's body). This would also cause a collision and end the game.\n\nThe only safe move is to continue 'UP', even though it doesn't eat an apple. \n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#  A   #\n#  H   #\n#  S   #\n#  SSA #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nAnalysis:\n1. The snake's head 'H' is at position (2, 3) (row 2, column 3), moving UP (current direction).\n2. The body segments 'S' are at (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 4), and (4, 5).\n3. Apples 'A' are at (1, 3), (4, 6), and (5, 4).\n4. Possible moves:\n   - UP: Not allowed (would reverse direction from current UP to DOWN, which is invalid).\n   - DOWN: Would move to (3, 3), which is a body segment 'S' (collision, game over).\n   - LEFT: Would move to (2, 2), which is empty (safe).\n   - RIGHT: Would move to (2, 4), which is empty (safe).\n\nBest move:\n- LEFT or RIGHT are both safe, but LEFT moves toward the apple at (1, 3) (UP-LEFT path), while RIGHT moves away from apples. Thus, LEFT is the better choice to potentially reach the apple in future moves.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Let me analyze the current game board and situation:\n\nCurrent game board:\n########\n#  A   #\n# HS   #\n#  S   #\n#  S A #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 18\n\nSnake position analysis:\n- Head (H) is at (2,3) [row 2, column 3]\n- Body parts:\n  - S at (2,2)\n  - S at (3,3)\n  - S at (4,3)\n\nPossible moves:\n1. LEFT - would move to (2,2) which is occupied by snake body (S) - collision, game over\n2. DOWN - would move to (3,3) which is occupied by snake body (S) - collision, game over\n3. UP - would move to (1,3) which is empty (valid move)\n4. RIGHT - would move to (2,4) which is empty (valid move)\n\nSince current direction is LEFT, we cannot choose RIGHT (as it would be a direct reverse). Therefore, the only valid move is UP.\n\nAnswer: UP","Let me analyze the current game board and situation:\n\nCurrent game board:\n########\n# HA   #\n# SS   #\n#  S   #\n#    A #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 19\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

The snake's head 'H' is at position (1, 3) (row 1, column 3, 0-indexed). The current direction is RIGHT, so the next position is (1, 4).\n2. At (1, 4), there is an empty space, so the snake will move there without eating an apple. The tail will follow, and the snake's length remains the same.\n3. Possible next moves after moving RIGHT are UP, RIGHT, or DOWN (cannot reverse to LEFT).\n4. The closest apple is at (2, 5). To reach it efficiently, the best move after moving RIGHT to (1, 4) is to go DOWN to (2, 4), then RIGHT to (2, 5) to eat the apple.\n\nThus, the next direction should be DOWN to start the path toward the apple. \n\nAnswer: DOWN"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Moving RIGHT would take us to (4,4) which is empty\n\nBest move would be to head towards the closest apple at (6,3) below us. Since we can't go DOWN directly, we should turn RIGHT first to start moving down towards it.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Let me analyze the current game board and situation:\n\nCurrent game board:\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 2\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

Possible moves: RIGHT (continuing current direction), UP, or DOWN (can't reverse to LEFT)\n4. Looking at the apples:\n   - One at (2,4)\n   - Two at (6,3) and (6,5)\n\nBest move considerations:\n- Moving RIGHT would continue current path but there's no apple in that direction\n- Moving UP would head towards the apple at (2,4)\n- Moving DOWN would head towards the two apples at row 6\n\nThe optimal move appears to be DOWN to start heading towards the cluster of two apples at the bottom. This gives us more potential to collect multiple apples in sequence.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   H  #\n#  A A #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 3\n\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN, and its head ('H') is at position (6, 4). The possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (since reversing direction to UP is not allowed). \n\nLooking at the board:\n- Moving DOWN would take the snake to (7, 4), which is an apple ('A'). This is a good move as it increases the score and grows the snake.\n- Moving LEFT would take the snake to (6, 3), which is empty.\n- Moving RIGHT would take the snake to (6, 5), which is empty.\n\nThe best move is to eat the apple by moving DOWN. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  AHA #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 4\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is currently at position (6, 4) (assuming rows and columns are 1-indexed, with the top-left corner as (1,1)). The current direction is DOWN, so the snake is moving downward. The next position in the current direction is (7, 4), which is a wall ('#'), so moving DOWN would cause the snake to collide and end the game. \n\nPossible moves:\n- LEFT: The position to the left of 'H' is (6, 3), which is 'A' (an apple). This is a valid move and would allow the snake to eat the apple and grow.\n- RIGHT: The position to the right of 'H' is (6, 5), which is 'A' (an apple). This is also a valid move and would allow the snake to eat the apple and grow.\n- UP: The position above 'H' is (5, 4), which is empty. This is a valid move but does not result in eating an apple.\n- DOWN: Invalid (collision with wall).\n\nSince the current direction is DOWN, the snake cannot reverse to UP directly, but since DOWN is invalid, the only valid moves are LEFT or RIGHT. Both options allow the snake to eat an apple. Between LEFT and RIGHT, either is equally valid, but we can choose LEFT to prioritize the first available option.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Let me analyze the current game board and situation:\n\nCurrent game board:\n########\n#      #\n# A A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  HSA #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 5\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

Moving RIGHT would take the head to (5, 5), which is empty. No apple is eaten, and the snake moves forward.\n   - DOWN: This is a valid turn (not a reverse). Moving DOWN would take the head to (6, 4), which is empty. No apple is eaten, and the snake moves forward.\n   - UP: This is a valid turn (not a reverse). Moving UP would take the head to (4, 4), which is empty. No apple is eaten, and the snake moves forward.\n   - LEFT: This is a reverse direction (from RIGHT to LEFT), which is not allowed.\n\nOptimal move:\n- Moving RIGHT would take the head to (5, 5), which is empty but doesn't help in reaching an apple soon.\n- Moving DOWN would take the head to (6, 4), which is closer to the apple at (6, 5) in the next move.\n- Moving UP would take the head to (4, 4), which is closer to the apples at (2, 2) and (2, 4) in future moves.\n\nThe best immediate move is DOWN to position (6, 4), setting up to eat the apple at (6, 5) in the next move.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Let me analyze the current game board and situation:\n\nCurrent game board:\n########\n#      #\n# A A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   S  #\n#   HA #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 8\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

The possible directions to avoid reversing (which is not allowed) are LEFT, RIGHT, or continuing UP. \n\nLooking at the board:\n- Moving UP would lead to an empty space (safe).\n- Moving LEFT would lead to an apple 'A' (good for increasing score and length).\n- Moving RIGHT would lead to the snake's body 'S' (collision, game over).\n\nThe best move is LEFT to eat the apple and grow the snake.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n# A A  #\n#    HS#\n#   A S#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (4, 5) (row 4, column 5), and the body 'S' is at (4, 6) and (3, 6). The current direction is LEFT, so the snake cannot reverse to RIGHT. The possible directions are LEFT, UP, or DOWN.\n\nLooking at the board:\n- Moving LEFT would take the head to (4, 4), which is empty (' '), so this is safe.\n- Moving UP would take the head to (3, 5), which is empty (' '), so this is safe.\n- Moving DOWN would take the head to (5, 5), which is empty (' '), so this is safe.\n\nThe closest apple is at (3, 3) and (3, 5), but (3, 5) is closer to the head. Moving UP would allow the snake to eat the apple at (3, 5) in the next move. \n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n# A AH #\n#    SS#\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 15\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is currently at position (3, 5) moving UP. The possible moves are LEFT or RIGHT (since UP is the current direction and DOWN would be a direct reversal, which is not allowed). \n\nLooking at the board:\n- Moving LEFT would take the head to (3, 4), which is an apple 'A'. This is a good move as it allows the snake to eat the apple and grow.\n- Moving RIGHT would take the head to (3, 6), which is empty. This is safe but does not provide immediate benefit.\n\nThe best move is LEFT to eat the apple and grow the snake.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Let me analyze the current game board and situation:\n\nCurrent game board:\n########\n#      #\n# A HS #\n#    SS#\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#A     #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nSnake head (H) position: row 3, column 4\nSnake body parts (S): \n- row 3, column 5\n- row 4, columns 4-5\n\nApples (A) positions:\n- row 2, column 3\n- row 4, column 5\n- row 6, column 1\n\nPossible moves from current LEFT direction (cannot reverse to RIGHT):\n1. LEFT (continue current direction)\n   - would move H to (3,3)\n   - this is empty space - safe move\n2. UP \n   - would move H to (2,4)\n   - this is empty space - safe move\n3. DOWN\n   - would move H to (4,4)\n   - this is currently a body part (S) - would cause collision\n\nThe best strategic moves would be either:\n- LEFT to continue current path toward the apple at (4,5)\n- UP to go toward the apple at (2,3)\n\nBetween these, UP is slightly better because:\n1. It's closer to the apple (only 1 move away vs 2 moves for the other apple)\n2.

The possible directions to avoid reversing are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. \n\n- Moving DOWN would cause the snake to collide with its own body (the 'S' below the head), so this is not a valid move.\n- Moving LEFT would take the head to an empty space, which is safe.\n- Moving RIGHT would take the head to an empty space, which is also safe.\n\nThe best move is to go LEFT to avoid the body and potentially move toward the apples at the bottom of the board. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n# SSS  #\n#HS    #\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#AA    #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 21\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is at position (2, 2) and is currently moving LEFT. The body 'S' extends to the right of the head. The possible moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since RIGHT would reverse the direction, which is not allowed). \n\nTo avoid colliding with the wall or itself, the best move is DOWN.

The possible directions to turn are LEFT or RIGHT (since it cannot reverse direction to DOWN). \n\nLooking at the board, there is an apple ('A') to the left of the snake's head (at position (4, 2)) and another apple to the right (at position (2, 5)). Moving LEFT would allow the snake to eat the apple at (4, 2) in the next move, while moving RIGHT would require more steps to reach the apple at (2, 5). \n\nTherefore, the best move is to turn LEFT to eat the nearest apple.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#A A   #\n#     A#\n#      #\n# H    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 2\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT, and its head ('H') is at position (4, 3) (assuming rows are numbered top to bottom from 1 to 8 and columns left to right from 1 to 8). The possible moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since RIGHT would reverse the current direction, which is not allowed). \n\nLooking at the board:\n- Moving LEFT would take the snake to (4, 2), which is empty (' '), so no apple is eaten.\n- Moving UP would take the snake to (3, 3), which is empty (' '), so no apple is eaten.\n- Moving DOWN would take the snake to (5, 3), which is empty (' '), so no apple is eaten.\n\nSince no move directly eats an apple, the best strategy is to avoid walls and potential collisions. Moving DOWN or UP would keep the snake away from the walls for longer. Between UP and DOWN, DOWN seems safer because it moves the snake toward the center of the board where there are more apples (e.g., the apple at (6, 3) is not visible but could appear in future epochs).\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n\n########\n#A A   #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n# H    #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 3\n\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN, and its head 'H' is at position (5, 3). The possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (since reversing direction to UP is not allowed). \n\nLooking at the board, there is an apple 'A' at (2, 5). To reach it, the best move is to turn RIGHT, then continue DOWN in the next steps to eat the apple. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#A A   #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 4\n\nThe snake is currently moving to the RIGHT, and its head ('H') is at position (5, 3) (row 5, column 3). The possible directions to move are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (since LEFT would reverse the current direction, which is not allowed). \n\nLooking at the board:\n- Moving RIGHT would take the snake to (5, 4), which is empty. This is a safe move but doesn't eat an apple.\n- Moving UP would take the snake to (4, 3), which is empty. This is also safe but doesn't eat an apple.\n- Moving DOWN would take the snake to (6, 3), which is empty. This is safe but doesn't eat an apple.\n\nThe closest apple is at (1, 2) and (1, 4), but these are far away. The apple at (2, 6) is also not immediately reachable. Since no apple is directly in the path, the best strategy is to continue moving RIGHT to explore the board and avoid collisions.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#A A   #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 5\n\nThe snake is currently moving to the RIGHT. The possible directions to choose from are 'UP', 'DOWN', or 'RIGHT' (since the snake cannot reverse to 'LEFT'). \n\nLooking at the board:\n- Moving 'RIGHT' would continue the snake's current path, but there is no immediate apple in that direction.\n- Moving 'UP' would bring the snake closer to the apple at the top-right of the board ('A' in the third column of the first row).\n- Moving 'DOWN' would move the snake away from the apples.\n\nThe best choice is to go 'UP' to aim for the apple. \n\nAnswer: UP","Let me analyze the current game board and situation:\n\nCurrent game board:\n########\n#A A   #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 6\n\nAnalysis:\n1. The snake's head (H) is at position (4,4) (row 4, column 4)\n2. Current direction is UP, so the head is moving towards row 3\n3. Possible moves:\n   - Continue UP (not possible as that's the current direction)\n   - LEFT or RIGHT (valid turns)\n   - DOWN would be a reverse which is invalid\n4. Looking at the board:\n   - Moving LEFT would take us to (4,3) which is empty\n   - Moving RIGHT would take us to (4,5) which is empty\n   - Moving UP would take us to (3,4) which is empty\n5. The closest apple is at (1,2) and (1,4) in the top row, and (2,6)\n6.

Possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT\n4. Looking at nearby apples:\n   - There's an apple at (2, 2) - UP and LEFT would move us towards it\n   - Another apple at (2, 4) - UP would move us towards it\n   - Apple at (3, 7) - too far to consider now\n\nBest move would be UP because:\n- It moves us towards two apples (at (2,2) and (2,4))\n- It doesn't risk immediate collision\n- It gives us more options in future moves\n\nAnswer: UP","Let me analyze the current game board and situation:\n\nCurrent game board:\n########\n#A A   #\n#     A#\n# H    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 9\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

The closest apple is at (1, 2) (UP and LEFT from the head) and (1, 4) (UP and RIGHT from the head), and another at (2, 6) (RIGHT and DOWN from the head).\n4. Moving RIGHT would take the head to (3, 4), which is empty. This is safe but doesn't immediately eat an apple.\n5. Moving UP would take the head to (2, 3), which is empty, but closer to the apple at (2, 6).\n6. Moving DOWN would take the head to (4, 3), which is empty but not closer to any apple.\n\nThe best move is UP, as it positions the snake closer to the apple at (2, 6) in the next steps.\n\nAnswer: UP","Let me analyze the current game board and situation:\n\nCurrent game board:\n########\n#A A   #\n#  H  A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 11\n\nAnalysis:\n1. The snake's head ('H') is at position (2,3) (row 2, column 3)\n2. Current direction is UP, so we cannot choose DOWN as our next move (that would be reversing)\n3. Possible moves: LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP\n4. Apples are at positions:\n   - (1,2)\n   - (1,4)\n   - (2,6)\n\nIf we choose:\n- UP: Would move to (1,3) - empty space\n- LEFT: Would move to (2,2) - empty space\n- RIGHT: Would move to (2,4) - empty space\n\nThe best strategic move would be RIGHT to position (2,4), which:\n1.

The snake's head ('H') is at position (3,4) (row 3, column 4)\n2. Current direction is RIGHT, so possible moves are RIGHT (continue forward), UP, or DOWN (can't reverse to LEFT)\n3. There's an apple ('A') immediately to the RIGHT of the head at (3,6)\n4. There are also apples at (2,2) and (2,4)\n\nBest move:\n- Moving RIGHT will immediately eat the apple at (3,6), increasing score and growing the snake\n- This is the most direct way to get food without risking collision\n- Other moves would delay eating and potentially miss opportunities\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#A A   #\n#    HA#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 13\n\nThe snake is currently moving RIGHT, and its head ('H') is at position (2, 5).

The snake's head ('H') is at position (1,5) (row 1, column 5)\n2. Current direction is UP, which means the head is moving toward row 0\n3. Possible moves:\n   - Continue UP (not possible as it would hit the wall '#')\n   - Turn LEFT (would move to (1,4) which is empty)\n   - Turn RIGHT (would move to (1,6) which is an apple 'A')\n   - DOWN is not allowed as it would reverse current direction\n\nBest move:\n- RIGHT to eat the apple at (1,6), which will:\n  - Increase score by 1\n  - Grow the snake's length\n  - Not cause any collision\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Let me analyze the current game board and situation:\n\nCurrent game board:\n########\n#A A  H#\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 15\n\nAnalysis:\n1. The snake's head ('H') is at position (1,6) (row 1, column 6)\n2. Current direction is RIGHT, so possible moves are RIGHT (continue current direction), UP, or DOWN (cannot reverse to LEFT)\n3. Apples are at:\n   - (1,2)\n   - (1,4)\n   - (2,6)\n4. Moving RIGHT would hit the wall at (1,7) - game over\n5. Moving UP would go to (0,6) which is a wall - game over\n6. Moving DOWN would go to (2,6) where there's an apple - this is the only safe move that also gets us points\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to eat the apple at (2,6).\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n\n########\n#A A  S#\n#     H#\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN, and its head 'H' is at position (3, 6) (assuming rows and columns are 1-indexed). The possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (since the snake cannot reverse its direction to UP). \n\n- Moving DOWN would take the head to (4, 6), which is empty (' '), so this is safe.\n- Moving LEFT would take the head to (3, 5), which is empty (' '), so this is also safe.\n- Moving RIGHT would take the head to (3, 7), which is a wall ('#'), so this is not safe.\n\nThe best move is to go LEFT to avoid the wall and potentially position the snake closer to the apples at (1, 2), (1, 4), or (6, 4).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Current game board:\n\n########\n#A A   #\n#    HS#\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 17\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT, and its head 'H' is at position (3, 5) (assuming rows and columns are 1-indexed). The body 'S' is at (3, 6). The possible directions to move are LEFT (continuing current direction), UP, or DOWN (since reversing to RIGHT is not allowed). \n\nLooking at the board:\n- Moving LEFT would move the head to (3, 4), which is empty. This is safe.\n- Moving UP would move the head to (2, 5), which is empty. This is also safe.\n- Moving DOWN would move the head to (4, 5), which is empty. This is safe as well.\n\nThe closest apple is at (2, 2) and (2, 4). Moving UP would bring the head closer to the apple at (2, 2) or (2, 4), which is a good strategy to maximize the score. \n\nThus, the best move is UP to get closer to the apples. \n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n\n########\n#A A H #\n#    S #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 18\n\nThe snake is currently moving UP, and its head ('H') is at position (1, 6). The body ('S') is at (2, 6). There are apples ('A') at (1, 2), (1, 4), and (5, 3). \n\nSince the current direction is UP, the snake cannot reverse to DOWN. The possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP. \n\n- Moving UP would move the head to (0, 6), which is a wall ('#'), causing the game to end. \n- Moving LEFT would move the head to (1, 5), which is empty, so the snake would move safely. \n- Moving RIGHT would move the head to (1, 7), which is a wall ('#'), causing the game to end. \n\nThe safest move is LEFT, as it avoids walls and allows the snake to continue moving. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#A AHS #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is currently at position (1, 5) and is moving LEFT.

LEFT: This is the current direction, so the snake will continue moving LEFT to (1, 4), where there is an apple 'A'. Eating the apple will increase the score and grow the snake.\n2. UP: This is a valid turn (not reversing direction), but it would move the head to (0, 5), which is a wall '#', causing the game to end.\n3. DOWN: This is a valid turn (not reversing direction), moving the head to (2, 5), which is empty.

The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#  SSSH#\n#AA SS #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 26\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The goal of the game is to control the snake, eat as many apples as possible, and grow the snake in length. Each time the snake eats an apple, the score increases by one. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point.

The snake's head ('H') is at position (1,5) [row 1, column 5]\n2. The snake's body parts ('S') are at (1,2-4) and (2,2) and (3,2)\n3. Apples ('A') are at positions (2,1), (5,3)\n4. Current direction is RIGHT, so we cannot choose LEFT (as that would be a direct reversal)\n\nPossible moves:\n- RIGHT: Would move head to (1,6) - this is a wall ('#'), so this would end the game\n- UP: Would move head to (0,5) - this is a wall ('#'), would end the game\n- DOWN: Would move head to (2,5) - currently empty, safe move\n- LEFT: Not allowed (direct reversal from RIGHT)\n\nBest move is DOWN to (2,5), which:\n1. Moves us away from walls\n2. Keeps us away from our body\n3. Positions us closer to the apple at (5,3) for future moves\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n# SSSA #\n#AS H  #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nPossible moves:\n- The snake cannot reverse its direction, so \"UP\" is not allowed.\n- The snake can move \"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", or continue \"DOWN\".\n\nAnalysis:\n1. Moving \"DOWN\": The head would move to an empty space, no apple eaten.\n2. Moving \"LEFT\": The head would move to an empty space, no apple eaten.\n3. Moving \"RIGHT\": The head would move to an empty space, no apple eaten.\n\nSince no immediate apple can be eaten, the best strategy is to avoid colliding with the body or walls. Moving \"RIGHT\" is safe as it moves the head away from the body. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n# SSSA #\n#A  SH #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nAnalysis:\n1. The snake's head 'H' is at position (2, 5) (row 2, column 5), moving RIGHT.\n2. The body 'S' is at positions (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), forming the tail.\n3. Apples 'A' are at positions (1, 5), (2, 1), and (5, 3).\n4. Possible moves:\n   - Cannot move LEFT (reverse of RIGHT).\n   - Moving RIGHT would collide with the wall '#' at (2, 6).\n   - Moving UP would move to (1, 5), where there is an apple 'A'. This is safe and would grow the snake.\n   - Moving DOWN would move to (3, 5), which is empty and safe.\n\nBest move: UP to eat the apple at (1, 5) and grow the snake.\n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n\n########\n# SSSH #\n#AA SS #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 26\n\nThe snake is currently moving UP, and its head 'H' is at the top-right corner of the snake's body. The possible moves are LEFT or RIGHT (since UP is the current direction and DOWN is a direct reverse, which is not allowed). \n\nLooking at the board:\n- Moving LEFT would take the head into the body ('S'), causing a collision and ending the game.\n- Moving RIGHT would take the head into an empty space, which is safe.\n\nThus, the best move is RIGHT to avoid collision and continue the game.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n\n########\n#  SSSH#\n#AA SS #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 27\n\nThe snake is currently moving RIGHT, and its head ('H') is at the end of its body ('SSSH'). The possible moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (since LEFT would reverse the current direction, which is not allowed). \n\nLooking at the board:\n- Moving RIGHT would cause the snake to collide with the wall ('#'), ending the game.\n- Moving UP would take the head to a space occupied by an apple ('A'), allowing the snake to eat it and grow.\n- Moving DOWN would take the head to an empty space, but this is less optimal since eating an apple is preferable.\n\nThe best move is UP to eat the apple and grow the snake.\n\nAnswer: UP"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Avoids getting boxed in\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#A   A #\n# S    #\n# H    #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nAnalysis:\n1. The snake's head 'H' is at position (4, 3) (row 4, column 3), moving DOWN.\n2. The snake's body 'S' is at position (3, 3), so the tail is behind the head moving DOWN.\n3. Possible moves: Since the current direction is DOWN, the snake cannot reverse to UP. The valid moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue DOWN.\n4. Nearby apples:\n   - There is an apple 'A' to the LEFT at (4, 2).\n   - There is an apple 'A' to the RIGHT at (4, 6).\n   - Moving DOWN would not lead to an apple immediately.\n\nBest move: \n- Moving LEFT to (4, 2) would eat the apple, grow the snake, and increase the score by 1. This is the optimal move.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#A   A #\n#      #\n#HS    #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT, with its head at position (3, 2) and body at (3, 1). The possible directions to avoid reversing are LEFT, UP, or DOWN (since RIGHT would reverse the direction, which is not allowed). \n\nLooking at the board:\n- Moving LEFT would continue the current path, but there is no apple in that direction, and it would eventually lead to a dead end.\n- Moving UP would take the head to (2, 2), which is an empty space, but closer to the apple at (1, 1) or (1, 5).\n- Moving DOWN would take the head to (4, 2), which is empty, but closer to the apple at (4, 6).\n\nThe best move is to go UP to position (2, 2), as it positions the snake closer to the apples at (1, 1) or (1, 5) without risking an immediate collision. \n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n\n########\n#A   A #\n#H     #\n#S     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 7\n\nThe snake is currently moving UP. The possible directions to choose from are LEFT, RIGHT, or UP (since DOWN would reverse the current direction, which is not allowed). \n\nLooking at the board:\n- Moving UP would take the snake to the top row, where there is an apple ('A') to the left and another to the right. \n- Moving LEFT would take the snake to the left wall ('#'), which would cause a collision and end the game.\n- Moving RIGHT would take the snake to an empty space, but it would miss the nearby apples.\n\nThe best move is to continue moving UP to eat the apple on the left or right in the top row. Since the apple on the left is closer to the current position of the head, moving UP is the optimal choice to eat it.\n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n\n########\n#H   AA#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake is currently moving upwards. Since the snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., cannot go DOWN from UP), the possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP. \n\nLooking at the board:\n- Moving UP would take the snake's head ('H') into a wall ('#'), which would end the game. So UP is not a good choice.\n- Moving LEFT would take the head into an empty space, which is safe.\n- Moving RIGHT would take the head into an empty space, but it is closer to the apples ('AA') on the right side of the board. \n\nThe best move is RIGHT, as it positions the snake closer to the apples, increasing the chance to eat them in future moves.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n\n########\n#SH  AA#\n#S     #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 9\n\nThe snake is currently moving to the RIGHT. The head 'H' is at position (1, 2) and the body 'S' is at (1, 1) and (2, 1). There are apples ('A') at positions (1, 5), (1, 6), and (4, 6). \n\nPossible moves:\n- RIGHT: The snake will move to (1, 3), which is empty. No apple is eaten, and the snake moves forward.\n- DOWN: The snake will move to (2, 2), which is empty. No apple is eaten, and the snake moves forward.\n- UP: The snake will move to (0, 2), which is a wall ('#'). This would cause a collision and end the game.\n\nSince the current direction is RIGHT, the snake cannot reverse to LEFT. Therefore, the valid moves are RIGHT or DOWN. \n\nTo maximize the chance of eating an apple soon, moving RIGHT is better because it brings the snake closer to the apples at (1, 5) and (1, 6).\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Let me analyze the current game board and situation:\n\nCurrent game board:\n########\n#SSH AA#\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 10\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

The goal of the game is to control the snake, eat as many apples as possible, and grow the snake in length. Each time the snake eats an apple, the score increases by one. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls.

The snake's head ('H') is at position (6, 4) (row 6, column 4). \n2. The current direction is DOWN, so the next position is (7, 4), but that is a wall ('#'), which would cause the snake to collide and lose the game.\n3. The snake cannot reverse direction to UP (since it is currently moving DOWN).\n4. The possible safe moves are LEFT or RIGHT:\n   - LEFT: The next position is (6, 3), which is an apple ('A'). Eating the apple will increase the score and grow the snake.\n   - RIGHT: The next position is (6, 5), which is an apple ('A'). Eating the apple will also increase the score and grow the snake.\n5. Both LEFT and RIGHT are valid moves, but LEFT is slightly better because it is closer to the center of the board, giving the snake more room to maneuver in the future.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Let me analyze the current game board and situation:\n\nCurrent game board:\n########\n#      #\n#S     #\n#SS    #\n# SS   #\n#  SS  #\n#A HSAA#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 23\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

Possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT\n\nLooking at possible moves:\n- LEFT: Would move to (6,3) which is already occupied by 'S' (body) - this would cause a collision and end the game\n- UP: Would move to (5,4) which is 'S' (body) - collision\n- DOWN: Would move to (7,4) which is '#' (wall) - collision\n\nAll possible moves lead to immediate game over. However, since we must choose a direction, we should choose the one that gives the highest score (eating an apple) before ending.\n\nIf we choose LEFT (even though it ends the game), we would eat the apple at (6,3) but that position is already occupied by 'S', so no apple there. Actually looking again, the apples are at (6,1), (6,5), (6,6) - none are immediately reachable in one move.\n\nTherefore, all moves are equally bad in this situation.

The snake's head 'H' is at position (6, 2) (assuming rows and columns are 0-indexed from the top-left).\n2. The current direction is LEFT, so the head is moving left.\n3. The next position to the left of 'H' is (6, 1), which is currently occupied by 'A' (an apple).\n4. Eating the apple will increase the score by 1 and grow the snake's length by 1.\n5.

The snake's head 'H' is at position (5, 1) (row 5, column 1). The current direction is UP, so the next position would be (4, 1).\n2. The cell at (4, 1) is 'A' (an apple). Eating the apple will increase the score by 1 and grow the snake's length.\n3. The snake cannot reverse its direction (DOWN is invalid), so the valid moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or continue UP.\n4. Continuing UP is safe and allows the snake to eat the apple. Moving LEFT or RIGHT would avoid the apple but is unnecessary since eating the apple is beneficial.\n\nBest move: Continue UP to eat the apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# S   A#\n#HSS   #\n#S SS  #\n#SSSSAA#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 27\n\nAnalysis:\n1. The snake's head 'H' is at position (4, 2) (row 4, column 2).\n2. The current direction is 'UP', so the next position for the head would be (3, 2).\n3. The position (3, 2) is currently occupied by 'S' (snake body), which would cause a collision and end the game if we continue moving 'UP'.\n4. To avoid collision, we must change direction to either 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT' (cannot reverse to 'DOWN' directly from 'UP').\n\nPossible moves:\n- 'LEFT': Move to (4, 1). This is occupied by 'S' (snake body), so this would also cause a collision.\n- 'RIGHT': Move to (4, 3). This is occupied by 'S' (snake body), so this would also cause a collision.\n\nSince all possible moves ('UP', 'LEFT', 'RIGHT') lead to collision, the game will end no matter what.

Possible moves: LEFT or RIGHT (since UP would collide with the wall and DOWN is invalid).\n\nOptimal move:\n- Moving LEFT would take the head to (3, 5), which is empty, avoiding collision.\n- Moving RIGHT would take the head to (3, 7), which is a wall ('#'), causing a collision and game over.\n\nThus, the best move is LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#   AHS#\n#     S#\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT, and its head ('H') is at position (3, 5) (row 3, column 5).

However, this is not allowed because the snake cannot reverse its direction (from LEFT to RIGHT directly).\n2. RIGHT: Not possible, as it would reverse the current direction (LEFT to RIGHT).\n3. UP: This would move the head to (2, 5). This is safe and does not collide with the body or walls.\n4. DOWN: This would move the head to (4, 5). This is also safe and does not collide with the body or walls.\n\nThe best move is to go UP to (2, 5), which is closer to the apple at (2, 4). This sets up the snake to eat the apple in the next move.\n\nAnswer: UP","Current game board:\n\n########\n#    H #\n#   ASS#\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nThe snake is currently moving UP. From the current position of the head ('H'), moving UP would collide with the wall ('#'), which would end the game. Therefore, we need to choose a direction that avoids the wall and does not reverse the current direction (UP cannot be reversed to DOWN). The possible directions are LEFT or RIGHT.\n\n- Moving LEFT would take the head to an empty space (' '), which is safe.\n- Moving RIGHT would take the head to an empty space (' '), which is also safe.\n\nBetween the two, moving LEFT is better because it positions the snake closer to the apple ('A') at the bottom left of the board, which can be targeted in future moves. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Let me analyze the current game board and situation:\n\nCurrent game board:\n########\n#   HS #\n#   AS #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A   #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\nCurrent epoch: 13\n\nSnake position analysis:\n- Head (H) is at (1,5)\n- Body segments:\n  - S at (1,6)\n  - S at (2,5)\n  - A (apple) at (2,4) - this is actually an apple, not part of the snake\n\nPossible moves (cannot reverse direction from LEFT to RIGHT):\n1.

The snake's head ('H') is at position (4, 3) (assuming rows and columns are 1-indexed from top-left).\n2. The current direction is LEFT, so the head is moving left.\n3. The next position to the left of the head is (4, 2), which is currently occupied by 'S' (snake body). Moving left would cause the snake to collide with itself, ending the game.\n4. Therefore, we must change direction to avoid collision. The possible directions are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (cannot reverse to RIGHT directly from LEFT, but since LEFT is the current direction, RIGHT is actually a valid turn here as it's not a direct reversal).\n\nLooking at possible moves:\n- UP: (3, 3) is 'S' (collision)\n- DOWN: (5, 3) is ' ' (empty)\n- RIGHT: (4, 4) is 'S' (collision)\n\nThe only safe move is DOWN to position (5, 3), which is empty.

The other possible directions are UP or DOWN (cannot reverse to LEFT since the current direction is RIGHT).\n   - UP: The position above the head is (4, 4), which is 'S' (snake body). This would cause a collision.\n   - DOWN: The position below the head is (6, 4), which is empty (' '). This is safe but less optimal since it moves away from the apples.\n5.

Checking possible moves:\n   - LEFT: would move to (1,4) which is already occupied by snake body ('S') - collision, game over\n   - UP: would move to (0,5) which is a wall ('#') - collision, game over\n   - DOWN: would move to (2,5) which is occupied by snake body ('S') - collision, game over\n\nAll possible moves lead to immediate game over. However, since we must choose a direction, LEFT is the current direction and we cannot reverse, so we'll continue LEFT even though it ends the game.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#  HSS #\n#   ASS#\n#      #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nAnalysis:\n1. The snake's head 'H' is at position (1, 4) (assuming top-left is (0,0)), moving LEFT (towards decreasing column index).\n2. The snake's body 'S' extends to the right of the head, so the next body segment is at (1, 5) and (1, 6).\n3. The snake cannot reverse direction (RIGHT is invalid since current direction is LEFT).\n4. Possible moves: LEFT (continue current direction), UP, or DOWN.\n\nPossible moves and outcomes:\n- LEFT: Move to (1, 3). This is an empty space, so the snake moves forward without growing.\n- UP: Move to (0, 4). This is a wall '#', so the game would end (invalid move).\n- DOWN: Move to (2, 4). This is an empty space, so the snake moves forward without growing.\n\nBest move: LEFT (continue current direction to avoid unnecessary turns and keep options open for future moves).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n# HSSS #\n#   AS #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT. The possible directions to turn without reversing are UP or DOWN (since LEFT is the current direction and RIGHT would be a direct reversal, which is not allowed). \n\nLooking at the board:\n- If we choose UP, the head (H) will move to the position above it, which is a wall ('#'). This would result in a collision and end the game.\n- If we choose DOWN, the head (H) will move to the position below it, which is empty (' '). This is a safe move and allows the snake to continue.\n\nThus, the best move is DOWN to avoid collision and continue the game. \n\nAnswer: DOWN","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n# SSSS #\n# H A  #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nAnalysis:\n1. The snake's head 'H' is currently at position (3, 3) (assuming rows and columns are 1-indexed from the top-left corner).\n2. The current direction is DOWN, so the snake cannot reverse to UP.\n3. The possible moves are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (since DOWN is the current direction, it is allowed).\n4. The apple 'A' is directly to the right of the head (position (3, 5)), so moving RIGHT will eat the apple and grow the snake.\n5. Moving DOWN would avoid the apple but is safe (no collision).\n6. Moving LEFT would collide with the snake's body 'S' at (3, 2), which would end the game.\n\nBest move: RIGHT (to eat the apple and grow the snake).\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n# SSS  #\n# SHA  #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 25\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is currently moving to the RIGHT. The possible directions to avoid collision and continue moving are RIGHT, UP, or DOWN (since reversing to LEFT is not allowed). \n\nLooking at the board:\n- Moving RIGHT would take the head to the 'A' (apple), increasing the score and growing the snake.\n- Moving UP would take the head into the body ('S'), causing a collision and ending the game.\n- Moving DOWN would take the head into an empty space, avoiding collision but not eating an apple.\n\nThe best move is to continue RIGHT to eat the apple and grow the snake. \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n# SSSA #\n# SSH  #\n#      #\n#    A #\n#     A#\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

The apples 'A' are at positions (1, 5), (4, 5), (5, 6).\n4. The next move in the current direction (RIGHT) would take the head to (2, 5), which is empty, so the snake would move forward without eating an apple.\n5.

There are apples ('A') at positions (1, 5), (4, 4), and (5, 6).\n4. Moving DOWN would cause the snake to collide with its own body at (5, 5), which is currently empty but would become part of the snake's body if it moves DOWN. So DOWN is invalid.\n5. Moving LEFT would take the head to (4, 4), where there is an apple ('A'). This is a valid move and would increase the score by 1.\n6.

The body ('S') is to the right of the head at (6, 6). The possible directions to avoid reversing are UP, DOWN, or LEFT (since RIGHT would reverse the current LEFT direction, which is not allowed).\n\nPossible moves:\n1. LEFT: The head would move to (6, 4). This position is empty (' '), so it's safe.\n2. UP: The head would move to (5, 5). This position is empty (' '), so it's safe.\n3. DOWN: The head would move to (7, 5). This position is a wall ('#'), so it's unsafe (game over).\n\nThe closest apple is at (5, 2). Moving UP would bring the head closer to this apple, while moving LEFT would not directly help in reaching it. Therefore, the best move is UP to get closer to the apple.\n\nAnswer: UP","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#A  H  #\n#   S  #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nAnalysis:\n1. The snake's head 'H' is at position (5, 4) (row 5, column 4), moving UP (current direction).\n2. The snake's body 'S' is at position (6, 4), so the tail is below the head.\n3. Possible moves: \n   - UP: Not allowed (would reverse direction to DOWN, which is invalid).\n   - DOWN: Not allowed (would collide with the body 'S' at (6, 4)).\n   - LEFT: Valid (no collision, moves to (5, 3)).\n   - RIGHT: Valid (no collision, moves to (5, 5)).\n4. Apples are at positions: (2, 4), (3, 2), and (5, 2).\n   - Moving LEFT (to (5, 3)) does not eat an apple.\n   - Moving RIGHT (to (5, 5)) does not eat an apple.\n   - Moving LEFT is safer as it avoids potential future collisions with the wall or body.\n\nBest move: LEFT (avoids immediate collision and keeps options open).\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#A HS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nThe snake's head 'H' is currently at position (5, 4) (row 5, column 4), and the body 'S' is at (5, 5). The current direction is LEFT, so the snake is moving left. \n\nPossible moves:\n- Continue LEFT: This would move the head to (5, 3), which is empty (' '), so this is safe.\n- Turn UP: This would move the head to (4, 4), which is empty (' '), so this is safe. However, UP is not a direct reversal of LEFT (the reversal would be RIGHT), so this is allowed.\n- Turn DOWN: This would move the head to (6, 4), which is empty (' '), so this is safe. DOWN is also not a direct reversal of LEFT, so this is allowed.\n\nThe best move is to continue LEFT to (5, 3), as this keeps the snake moving in a straight line and avoids unnecessary turns. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n#      #\n#AHS   #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 9\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT, and its head is at the position of 'H' in the bottom row. The body 'S' is to the right of the head, and there is an apple 'A' to the left of the head. \n\nPossible moves:\n- LEFT: This would move the head into the apple 'A', eating it and increasing the score by 1. The snake would grow, and a new apple would spawn elsewhere.\n- DOWN: This would move the head downward into an empty space, avoiding the apple but also avoiding collision.\n- UP: This would move the head upward into an empty space, avoiding the apple but also avoiding collision.\n\nSince the snake cannot reverse its direction (RIGHT is not allowed from LEFT), the best move is to eat the apple by moving LEFT. \n\nAnswer: LEFT","Here is the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n#  A   #\n#HSS   #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nPossible moves: Since the snake is currently moving LEFT, it cannot reverse direction to RIGHT.

Invalid move.\n2. UP: The head (H) will move up to the empty space above it. This is safe and avoids collision.\n3. DOWN: The head (H) will move down to the empty space below it. This is also safe, but there is no immediate benefit (no apple nearby).\n\nBest move: UP, as it avoids collision and moves the snake toward the apple at the top of the board.\n\nAnswer: UP","Let me analyze the current game board and situation:\n\nCurrent game board:\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n#H A   #\n#SS    #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\nCurrent epoch: 11\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

The valid moves are LEFT, UP, or DOWN.\n\nNext move considerations:\n1. LEFT: Moves to (1, 4), which is empty. Safe but no apple.\n2. UP: Moves to (0, 5), which is a wall '#'. Game over.\n3. DOWN: Moves to (2, 5), which is part of the snake's body 'S'.

The possible moves are RIGHT (continuing current direction), UP, or DOWN (since LEFT would reverse the direction, which is not allowed). \n\nLooking at the board:\n- Moving RIGHT would take the snake to (4, 5), which is empty. No apple is eaten, and the snake moves forward.\n- Moving UP would take the snake to (3, 4), which is empty. No apple is eaten, and the snake moves forward.\n- Moving DOWN would take the snake to (5, 4), where there is an apple ('A').

The snake's head ('H') is at position (4, 3) (assuming rows and columns are numbered starting from 0).\n2. The current direction is UP, so the snake is moving upwards.\n3. Possible moves: Since the current direction is UP, the snake cannot reverse to DOWN. The available moves are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n4. Nearby apples: There is an apple ('A') at (1, 1) (top-left) and another at (5, 1) (bottom-left), and one at (2, 6) (top-right).\n\nThe best move is to go LEFT to eat the apple at (5, 1) (bottom-left), as it is the closest and safest option.

The closest apple is at (2, 2) ('A') and (3, 6) ('A'). Moving LEFT would bring the snake closer to the apple at (2, 2), while moving RIGHT would bring it closer to the apple at (3, 6).\n6. Moving RIGHT is safer as it avoids the body segments ('S') and aligns with the current downward momentum.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Let me analyze the current game board and situation:\n\nCurrent game board:\n########\n#A S   #\n#  SH A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\nCurrent epoch: 40\n\nAnalysis:\n1.

The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER' (without quotes), where YOUR_ANSWER is your final answer to the question,e.g.'Answer: LEFT'\n\nYou are controlling a snake in a Snake game.The board size is 8x8.In the game board. The goal of the game is to control the snake, eat as many apples as possible, and grow the snake in length. Each time the snake eats an apple, the score increases by one. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point. The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#    SH#\n#A   SS#\n#      #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 45\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","epoch":45,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
