The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point.

The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n# A   A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#HS    #\n#      #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 12\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n"],"action":"LEFT","response":["########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#A     #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 1\n\nThe snake's head is currently at (4, 3), and it's moving UP.

The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point. The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#AA    #\n#A     #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 1\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point. The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#   A  #\n# H    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  A A #\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 2\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Here's the current game board:\n\n########\n#      #\n#A   A #\n# A  H #\n#    S #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 16\n\nThe snake is currently at (3, 5) (row, col) facing UP. The body is at (4, 5). If I continue UP, I will collide with the 'A' at (2, 5). I cannot reverse direction to go DOWN. I can go LEFT or RIGHT. Let's try going RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT\n","########\n#      #\n#A   A #\n# A  SH#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 17\n\nThe snake is currently moving RIGHT. If I continue moving RIGHT, the snake's head 'H' will collide with the wall '#', and the game will end. Therefore, I need to change direction to avoid collision. I can choose to go UP or DOWN.\n\nIf I choose UP, the next state of board will be\n\n########\n#      #\n#A   AH#\n# A  S #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nIf I choose DOWN, the next state of board will be\n\n########\n#      #\n#A   A #\n# A  S #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\nBecause there is nothing special with those direction,I choose to go UP to avoid collision.\n\nAnswer: UP\n","########\n#      #\n#A   AH#\n# A   S#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 18\n\nThe snake's head is currently at (2,7) and is moving UP. If it continues UP, it will hit the wall. Therefore, it must turn either LEFT or RIGHT. Since the snake cannot reverse its direction, and it's currently facing UP, it cannot move DOWN. I will choose to go LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT\n","########\n#   A  #\n#A   HS#\n# A   S#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 19\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT. It can move UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT. If it continues LEFT, it will collide with the wall in the next step. Therefore, the only valid options are UP and DOWN. If I choose DOWN, the snake will still be alive. So the safe action is DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN\n","########\n#   A  #\n#A   SS#\n# A  H #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 20\n\nThe snake's head is currently at (3, 6) and it's moving DOWN. If it continues DOWN, it will move to (4, 6), which is an empty space. So, let's move DOWN.\n\n########\n#   A  #\n#A   S #\n# A  S #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN\n","########\n#   A  #\n#A   S #\n# A  S #\n#    H #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 21\n\nThe snake's head is currently at (4, 5). The current direction is DOWN. If the snake moves DOWN, it will move to (5, 5), which is currently empty. So the snake can move DOWN.\n\n########\n#   A  #\n#A   S #\n# A  S #\n#    S #\n#    H #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN\n","########\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n# A  S #\n#    S #\n#    H #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 22\n\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN. If I continue DOWN, the snake's head 'H' will move to the position currently occupied by 'S'. This will cause the snake to collide with itself, resulting in a game over. Therefore, I must change direction. I can either turn LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nIf I turn LEFT, the new board state will be:\n\n########\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n# A  S #\n#    S #\n#   HS #\n#      #\n########\n\nIf I turn RIGHT, the new board state will be:\n\n########\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n# A  S #\n#    S #\n#    SH#\n#      #\n########\n\nTurning LEFT seems like a slightly better option as it keeps the snake further away from the wall.\n\nAnswer: LEFT\n","########\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n# A    #\n#    S #\n#   HS #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 23\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT. It cannot reverse direction to RIGHT. The possible moves are UP, DOWN, or LEFT. If I move LEFT, the snake's head will hit an empty space. If I move UP, the snake's head will hit the wall. If I move DOWN, the snake's head will hit the 'S'. So the only possible way to avoid colliding with itself or the wall is to move LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT\n","########\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#  HSS #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 24\n\nThe snake is currently moving LEFT. If I continue moving LEFT, the snake's head ('H') will move one square to the left. The coordinates of 'H' are (5,3). To the left of 'H' is an empty cell. Therefore, the snake can safely move LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT\n","########\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n# A    #\n#      #\n# HSS  #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 25\n\nThe snake's head is currently at position (5,2) moving LEFT.\nIf I input UP, the snake's head will move to (4,2), which is an empty space. The tail will follow.\nIf I input DOWN, the snake's head will move to (6,2), which is an empty space. The tail will follow.\nIf I input RIGHT, the snake cannot reverse direction, which is illegal.\nIf I input LEFT, the snake's head will move to (5,1), which is a wall, causing the game to end.\nTherefore, either UP or DOWN is valid. Let's choose UP.\n\nAnswer: UP\n","########\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n# A    #\n# H    #\n# SS   #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 26\n\nThe snake is currently at (4, 4) and moving UP. An apple is at (3, 4). If the snake moves UP, it will eat the apple at (3,4).\nMoving UP will result in the following board:\n########\n#   A  #\n#A H   #\n# A    #\n# S    #\n# SS   #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: UP\n","########\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n# H    #\n# SA   #\n# SS   #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: UP\n\nCurrent epoch: 27\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 3). It's currently moving UP. If it continues UP, it will move to (2, 3), which is an apple. So the snake will eat the apple and grow.\n\n########\n#   A  #\n#AH    #\n# S    #\n# SA   #\n# SS   #\n#      #\n########\n\nNow consider turning LEFT or RIGHT. If the snake turns LEFT, it moves to (3, 2). If it turns RIGHT, it moves to (3, 4). Since the current direction is UP, it cannot reverse to DOWN. So, the only available moves are LEFT and RIGHT. Let's choose LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT\n","Okay, I understand the rules. Here's the current game board:\n\n########\n#   A  #\n#A     #\n#HS    #\n# SA   #\n# S    #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT\n\nCurrent epoch: 28\n\nNow, I need to decide on the next move. Since the snake is currently moving LEFT, I cannot move RIGHT. If I move UP, I will hit the wall. If I move DOWN, I will hit the snake's body. Therefore, the only valid move is LEFT. Moving LEFT will result in the snake's head colliding with the apple ('A'). The snake will eat the apple, grow in length, and the score will increase.\n\nAnswer: LEFT\n"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

If it continues RIGHT, it will collide with the wall. Therefore, the snake must turn either UP or DOWN. Since it cannot reverse direction, it can't go LEFT. It can safely move DOWN.\n\nAnswer: DOWN\n","########\n#A A   #\n#   ASS#\n#     H#\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\nCurrent epoch: 53\n\nThe snake's head is currently at (3, 6). The current direction is DOWN. Moving DOWN would place the head at (4, 6). That location is currently empty, so the snake moves down. The tail retracts, so the 'S' at (2, 4) becomes empty.\n\n########\n#A A   #\n#   AS #\n#     S#\n#     H#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nAnswer: DOWN\n","########\n#A A   #\n#   A S#\n#     S#\n#     H#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: DOWN\n\nCurrent epoch: 54\n\nThe snake's head is currently at position (4, 5).

The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER' (without quotes), where YOUR_ANSWER is your final answer to the question,e.g.'Answer: LEFT'\n\nYou are controlling a snake in a Snake game.The board size is 8x8.In the game board. The goal of the game is to control the snake, eat as many apples as possible, and grow the snake in length. Each time the snake eats an apple, the score increases by one. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls of the board.The game board is a grid with walls by '#' around the edges.The snake starts with a length of 1 (just the head). The head is represented by 'H' and the body by 'S'. The game starts with 3 apples placed randomly on the board. Apples are represented by 'A'. The snake starts moving in the 'UP' direction. The snake moves one square at a time in the direction it is facing: 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', or 'RIGHT'. The player controls the snake’s movement by providing direction inputs. The snake cannot reverse its direction (i.e., it cannot turn 'UP' to 'DOWN' or 'LEFT' to 'RIGHT' directly).The snake loses the game if it collides with itself  or the walls. Each time the snake's head moves to a square occupied by an apple ('A'), the snake eats the apple and grows in length and meanwhile, the score will increase 1 point. The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n#A A   #\n#   A  #\n#      #\n#     S#\n#     S#\n#     H#\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 57\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n","epoch":57,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
