Therefore, valid moves are `LEFT`, `UP`, or `DOWN`. The snake cannot reverse to `RIGHT`.\n2. **Snake Position** (Head): The head (`H`) is currently at (row 4, column 2).\n3. **Apple Positions**:\n   - (row 1, column 2)\n   - (row 1, column 4)\n   - (row 2, column 6)\n4. **Move Possibilities**:\n    - `LEFT`: Moving one square to the left results in a wall collision (`#` at (4, 1)).

Since the snake must continue moving and eat as many apples as possible without colliding with walls, I need to evaluate potential moves. \n\nIf the snake moves DOWN, it will occupy row 6, column 2, which does not contain an apple ('A').

The apple (`A`) is located to the right of the snake head, so moving `RIGHT` will allow the snake to eat the apple, which increases the score by 1 and grows the snake's body.\n\nIf I decide to keep moving `RIGHT`, the next state of the board will appear as below:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n# A    #\n#  A   #\n#   SAH#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nThe body of the snake (`S`) grows where its head was previously located, and the new position of the snake's head (`H`) will be where the apple was. Therefore, the direction to provide in this game phase is:\n\n**Answer: RIGHT**","### Current Game Board:\n########  \n#    A #  \n# A    #  \n#  A   #  \n#   SH #  \n#      #  \n#      #  \n########  \n\nGiven the snake is currently moving in the `RIGHT` direction and the game rules, the optimal move is `RIGHT` because it avoids obstacles and progresses toward an apple. Since moving `UP` or `DOWN` will reverse direction or hit walls, and `LEFT` would take the snake away from apples.\n\n### Answer:\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########  \n#    A #  \n# A    #  \n#  A   #  \n#    SH#  \n#      #  \n#      #  \n########  \n\nTo determine the next move:\n- The snake's current direction is 'RIGHT'.\n- The snake's head ('H') is two steps away from the apple on its right.\n- Moving 'DOWN' would result in no immediate progress towards an apple.\n- Moving 'UP' or 'LEFT' would be invalid or reverse direction.  \n\nTo maximize the chance of eating an apple, continue in the current direction, 'RIGHT'.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Since the snake cannot reverse direction directly, the possible directions from 'LEFT' are 'UP', 'LEFT', or 'DOWN'.  \n\nMoving 'DOWN' will result in the snake eating an apple at (5,2), increasing the score by 1. This is the optimal move.\n\n### Answer:\nDOWN","### Current Game Board:\n```\n########\n#A     #\n#     A#\n#      #\n#      #\n#AH    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n### Current Direction: DOWN  \n### Current Epoch: 3  \n\nAccording to the rules of the game, the snake cannot reverse its direction directly. Since the current direction is `DOWN`, the snake can choose either `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, or continue moving `DOWN`.\n\nFor this scenario:  \nIf the snake moves `DOWN`, it will eat the apple ('A') at position (6, 1).

The snake's head ('H') is currently moving in the 'UP' direction. However, moving 'UP' will hit the wall and end the game. To survive and maximize the score, the snake should move to eat an apple. \n\nGiven that, the optimal move is to turn 'RIGHT', as this move places the snake closer to the nearest apple, located two squares away in the same row.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","### Current Game Board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#  A   #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\n### Analysis:\nThe snake head ('H') is located at position (4, 4) (row 4, column 4). The snake is currently moving RIGHT. According to the rules, the snake cannot reverse its direction directly.\n\n1. If the snake moves RIGHT, it will land at position (4, 5), an empty space.\n2. If the snake moves DOWN, it will land at position (5, 4), an empty space.\n3. If the snake moves UP, it will land at position (3, 4), an empty space.\n4. If the snake moves LEFT, it will land at position (4, 3), an empty space.\n\nAs the snake cannot reverse direction and the immediate goal is to maximize score by eating apples while avoiding walls or self-collision, the closest apple is at position (6, 5). The snake can move RIGHT first to get closer to the apple.\n\n### Decision:\nDirection: RIGHT\n\n### Output:\n```\nAnswer: RIGHT\n```","Here is the current game board:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#     A#\n#  A   #\n#    H #\n#      #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nGiven the current board, my task is to control the snake to eat apples and grow, ensuring that the snake does not collide with itself or the walls. The snake is currently moving in the 'RIGHT' direction, so I cannot immediately reverse to 'LEFT'. \n\nAnalyzing the board:  \nThe snake head ('H') is on the 4th row and 6th column. To maximize score, I must consider which direction will lead to an apple while ensuring safety.\n\nDirection Analysis:\n1. 'UP' leads to position (3, 6) — Empty space.\n2. 'DOWN' leads to position (5, 6) — Empty space.\n3. 'RIGHT' leads to position (4, 7) — Apple (A).\n\nThe best move is 'RIGHT', as it allows the snake to eat an apple and increase the score.  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current Game Board:\n########  \n#      #  \n#     A#  \n#  A   #  \n#     H#  \n#      #  \n#     A#  \n########  \n\nWith the snake currently facing RIGHT, its next potential position would be to move one square to the right. However, moving right will move the snake's head out of the bounds (into the wall), which will result in losing the game.\n\nGiven this, the best direction to avoid defeat and potentially eat apples is DOWN. Moving DOWN will allow the snake to move away from the wall and closer to the apple on the board.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Sure!

Here's a summary of the possible moves:\n\n1. **DOWN**: If the snake moves DOWN, it will collide with the wall (`#`) at the bottom of the board and lose the game.  \n2. **UP**: The snake cannot reverse its direction directly, so moving UP is not a valid option.  \n3. **LEFT**: If the snake moves LEFT, it will stay on an empty square and remain safe. \n4. **RIGHT**: If the snake moves RIGHT, it will reach an apple (`A`), eat it, grow in length, and score 1 point. This is the best option.\n\n**Decision:** The best move is to move RIGHT to eat the apple.\n\n### Final Output:\n\n**Answer: RIGHT**"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Based on this direction, the next move will make the snake collide with the wall, resulting in a game-over scenario. To avoid this, the snake must change its current direction.\n\nConsidering the available apples and avoiding walls:\n\n- 'LEFT' moves the snake toward an empty space.\n- 'RIGHT' moves the snake toward an apple ('A'), improving the score and growing the snake.\n\nThus, the best direction to choose is 'RIGHT'.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Game board:\n\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#   H A#\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nTo analyze the next move:\n1. The snake is currently moving RIGHT.\n2. Turning 'DOWN' is possible and advantageous as the snake will eat an apple ('A').\n3. The other options (UP, LEFT or continuing RIGHT) do not lead to immediate benefits. \n\nThus, the best move is to give the direction 'DOWN'.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:  \n```\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n# A    #\n#     A#\n#   H  #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\nLooking at the current state of the game board, the snake's head is positioned at row 5, column 4 (zero-indexed). The current direction of the snake is `DOWN`, but since there's a border wall immediately below, continuing to move down would result in a collision. The snake must change direction to avoid losing the game.\n\nTo score points and eat apples, the snake should attempt to move toward the nearest apple. The apple closest to the head of the snake is one square to the `RIGHT` (column 5, row 5).\n\nStrategy:\n- Moving `RIGHT` avoids collision.\n- Moving `RIGHT` positions the snake closer to the apple in its direct path.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","### Current Game Board:\n########  \n#A     #  \n#      #  \n# A    #  \n#     A#  \n#    H #  \n#      #  \n########  \n\n### Current Epoch: 4  \n### Current Direction: RIGHT  \n\nThe snake is currently facing **RIGHT** and can either continue moving in the same direction or turn **UP** or **DOWN**, avoiding reversing its current direction.\n\nAnalyzing the board:  \n- Moving **RIGHT** will lead to an empty space, enabling the snake to safely continue moving forward.  \n- Turning **UP** will move the snake towards an empty space but away from any apples.  \n- Turning **DOWN** will also move the snake towards an empty space but does not lead to adjacent apples immediately.  \n\nTo maximize score, it appears the optimal strategy here is to continue moving **RIGHT**, as it keeps the snake safe and allows for further exploration towards potential apples.\n\n### Final Output:  \nAnswer: RIGHT","Current Game Board:\n########  \n#A     #  \n#      #  \n# A    #  \n#     A#  \n#     H#  \n#      #  \n########  \n\nCurrent Direction: RIGHT  \nCurrent Epoch: 5  \n\nTo determine the best direction, we need to analyze the surrounding squares of the snake's head ('H'). The snake is currently heading RIGHT. It cannot reverse its direction directly, but it can change to UP or DOWN.\n\nFrom the game board, we can see the following:  \n- Moving RIGHT will enter an empty space.  \n- Moving UP will also enter an empty space.  \n- Moving DOWN will hit a wall ('#').  \n\nThe best option is to stay on the current path by moving RIGHT, as it keeps the snake in a safe position while moving closer to the apple at column 6, row 4.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Among the valid directions, continuing `RIGHT` seems the best option in this case, as it keeps the snake closer to the apple at `(6, 4)` and avoids sharp turns.\n\n### Movement:\n\nThe snake should continue moving `RIGHT`.\n\n### Required Output:\n\n```\nAnswer: RIGHT\n```","Current game board:\n\n########  \n#      #  \n#A     #  \n# A    #  \n#    H #  \n#      #  \n#   A  #  \n########  \n\n---\n\nThe snake is moving in the 'RIGHT' direction, and based on the rules, it cannot reverse its direction directly. \n\nLooking at the game board:\n- The snake's head ('H') is on the 5th row and 6th column.\n- The best move to maximize score would be going 'DOWN' to reach the apple ('A') directly below.\n\nThus, my move is 'DOWN'.\n\n---\n\nAnswer: DOWN","### Current Game Board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#    H #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\n### Analysis:\n- Currently, the snake's head (`H`) is located at (5, 5) (row 5, column 5) counting from the top-left corner as (1, 1).\n- The snake is moving `DOWN`.\n- Directly below the snake head is a wall (`#`), so moving `DOWN` will cause the snake to collide and lose the game.\n- The best move is to turn `LEFT` toward the empty space, ensuring the game continues.\n\n### Decision: Move `LEFT`.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Certainly! Let's first reiterate the current game board before analyzing and providing a direction.\n\nCurrent game board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#A     #\n# A    #\n#      #\n#   H  #\n#   A  #\n########\n```\n\n### Game Analysis:\n- The snake's head is represented by `H` and is currently at position `(5, 4)` (row 5, column 4).\n- The snake is currently moving in the `LEFT` direction.\n- The nearest apple (`A`) appears to be directly below the snake at position `(6, 4)`.\n\n#### Possible moves:\n1. **LEFT**: The snake will move left to position `(5, 3)`. This step does not align it with any apple, but it's a safe move.\n2. **UP**: This move is invalid since it reverses the current direction.\n3. **DOWN**: The snake will move down to position `(6, 4)`, where it can eat the apple and grow the snake in length. This is the optimal move.\n4. **RIGHT**: This move is invalid since the snake is currently moving left and cannot reverse direction directly.\n\n### Recommended Move:\nThe optimal move is **DOWN**, as it will allow the snake to eat the nearest apple and gain a score.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current Game Board:\n\n########  \n#      #  \n#A     #  \n# A    #  \n#      #  \n#   S  #  \n#A  H  #  \n########  \n\nBased on the game board and current direction ('DOWN'), the snake's next move is determined to avoid collision, aim to eat an apple, or continue moving safely. Observing the board, there is an apple ('A') directly below the snake's head ('H'). Moving 'DOWN' will allow the snake to eat the apple, grow, and increase the score.\n\nThe next move is 'DOWN'.\n\nAnswer: DOWN"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

If the snake moves RIGHT, it continues towards the wall and doesn't make progress toward apples.  \n5. Moving UP is invalid because it reverses the current direction.  \n6. Moving LEFT is inefficient since it moves away from the nearest apples.  \n7. Moving DOWN aligns the snake to collect the apple at (5, 4).\n\nThe best move is **DOWN**.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","### Current Game Board:\n```\n########\n#    A #\n#      #\n# AA   #\n#   S  #\n#   H  #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\n### Current Status:\n- Current Direction: DOWN\n- Current Epoch: 3\n\n### Steps to Decide the Next Move:\n1. The snake's current direction is **DOWN**.\n2. The snake cannot immediately reverse its direction, so it can either go **LEFT**, **RIGHT**, or continue **DOWN**.\n3. The goal is to eat apples if possible while avoiding collision with walls or itself.\n4. Based on the current board, moving **DOWN** will lead the snake to an empty square. **RIGHT** moves closer to an apple.

The snake head (`H`) is in the 6th row, 5th column, and its body (`S`) is right behind it at the 6th row, 4th column. \n\nTo make a move:\n- In the current direction (`RIGHT`), the snake head will land at (6,6), which is an empty space.\n- This direction is safe since it avoids collisions with the wall or itself.\n- There are no apples in the immediate next square, but it ensures survival for this epoch.\n\nSince the snake cannot reverse or turn directly backward, directions `LEFT` or `DOWN` are invalid relative to the snake's current movement. The remaining options are either to continue `RIGHT` or turn `UP`.\n\n**Optimal Move:** `RIGHT`.\n\n### Required Format:\nAnswer: RIGHT","\nCurrent Game Board:\n########  \n#    A #  \n#      #  \n# AA   #  \n#      #  \n#    SH#  \n#      #  \n########  \n\nGiven that the snake's current direction is 'RIGHT', my task is to ensure the snake safely moves without reversing its direction or colliding with walls, while aiming to eat the apples.

The snake currently has direction `UP`.\n2. To remain within the bounds of the game and maximize the score:\n   - Moving `UP` again would lead to an empty space.\n   - Moving `LEFT` would land the snake on an empty space and does not help.\n   - Moving `RIGHT` also ends up on an empty space.\n   - Moving `DOWN` will result in the snake moving towards the apple ('A') directly below it and eating the apple.\n3. As per the rules, moving `DOWN` would allow the snake to grow by one square while increasing the score.\n\n### Decision:\nThe best move is to go `DOWN`.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Current game board:\n\n########  \n#      #  \n#      #  \n#  H   #  \n#      #  \n#  A   #  \n#  A  A#  \n########  \n\nAccording to the current game board, the snake's head ('H') is moving in the UP direction. To move strategically and increase the score, I need to decide a direction where the snake can continue playing safely and aim to eat apples.\n\nAnalyzing the board, moving UP will cause the snake's head to hit the wall ('#'). Therefore, moving UP would lead to losing the game. Since the snake cannot reverse direction directly to DOWN, the best move is shifting towards either LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nHowever, moving RIGHT directs the snake closer to the nearest apple (position 6,6), while moving LEFT leads away from apples. Thus, the optimal direction is RIGHT.\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:  \n########  \n#      #  \n#      #  \n#   H  #  \n#      #  \n#  A   #  \n#  A  A#  \n########  \n\nAccording to the given game board, the snake's current head is moving RIGHT, and the apples are located below and in the same column. Turning DOWN would allow the snake to eat an apple in the upcoming move. The snake cannot turn UP because it is initially moving RIGHT.\n\nDirection: DOWN  \nAnswer: DOWN","### Current Game Board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   H  #\n#  A   #\n#  A  A#\n########\n```\n\n### Rules Assessment:\nThe snake is currently moving `DOWN`. From the snake's current position `(row 4, column 4)`, the following moves are analyzed:\n  - **UP**: Invalid since the snake cannot reverse direction.\n  - **DOWN**: Moves to `(row 5, column 4)`, which has an apple (`A`). The snake will eat the apple, grow, and increase its score by 1.\n  - **LEFT**: Moves to `(row 4, column 3)`, which is empty. No apple is eaten.\n  - **RIGHT**: Moves to `(row 4, column 5)`, which is empty.

The Current direction indicates the direction in which the snake is currently moving forward and the Game board indicates the current map of game.Remember, the game will end after the 100th epoch.\n\nFor example,if the board is \n########\n#     A#\n#S     #\n#H     #\n#AA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nand the direction you give is DOWN,then you will eat an apple ,increase 1 score and the next state of board will be \n########\n#  A  A#\n#S     #\n#S     #\n#HA    #\n#      #\n#      #\n########\n\nThe Direction you give should be one of 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP' and 'DOWN'\n\nGame board:\n\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     H#\n#     S#\n#     A#\n########\n\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT\n\nCurrent epoch: 10\n\nBefore giving your answer,you need to repeat the current game board first.\n"],"action":"RIGHT","response":["Game board:\n\n########  \n#    A #  \n#      #  \n#      #  \n#  H   #  \n# A    #  \n#     A#  \n########  \n\n---\n\n**Analysis**:  \nThe snake head `H` is located at row 4, column 4 (in matrix row-column coordinates).  \nThe current direction is `UP`. The snake is facing upward and can move in either `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, or continue `UP`. It cannot reverse and go `DOWN`.  \n\n**Nearby apples**:  \n- There's an apple `A` at row 5, column 2 (below and to the left of `H`).  \n- There's another apple `A` in row 6, column 6 (farther below).  \n\nLooking at the layout, the snake must strategically choose a path to collect apples without crashing into walls or getting stuck. Moving down or left will eventually reach an apple. Let's move `LEFT`.\n\n---\n\n**Answer**: LEFT","Game board:\n\n########  \n#    A #  \n#      #  \n#      #  \n# H    #  \n# A    #  \n#     A#  \n########  \n\nBased on the current direction, which is LEFT, I cannot reverse it to RIGHT directly. Moving LEFT will result in hitting the wall ('#') directly, causing the snake to lose. To avoid this, I'll move DOWN as it is a safe move and leads toward an apple ('A') to maximize the score.  \n\nAnswer: DOWN","### Current Game Board:\n\n```\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S    #\n# H    #\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe snake is heading DOWN. The current position of the head ('H') is at row 5, column 2. There’s no apple immediately below, and moving DOWN will eventually lead the snake closer to the bottom apple ('A') in row 6, column 6. Since the snake cannot reverse direction directly and must move in this direction without breaking the rules, the next logical move is still DOWN.\n\n### Decision:\nThe snake continues DOWN to avoid collision and move closer to the apple.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","### Current Game Board:\n```\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S    #\n# H   A#\n########\n```\n\n### Analysis:\nThe current direction is `DOWN`. The snake needs to move towards the apples strategically to maximize the score. Moving `DOWN` will cause the snake to collide with the wall, so this direction is invalid. Let’s evaluate other options:\n\n- `LEFT`: Moving left will navigate away from the apples and not obtain any immediate rewards.\n- `RIGHT`: Moving right will enable the snake to eat the apple directly in the next move.\n- `UP`: Moving up will move away from the apples, which is not optimal.\n\n### Optimal Move:\nThe optimal move is `RIGHT`, as it immediately eats the apple and increases the score by 1.\n\n---\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n```\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# SH  A#\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT  \nCurrent epoch: 5  \n\nThe snake's head (`H`) is moving towards the right. The snake's next position will move into the square with the apple (`A`) on the right. Thus, the snake will eat the apple, increase in length, and the score will increase by 1.  \nThe new state of the game board will be:\n\n```\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# SSH   #\n########\n```\n\nAnswer: RIGHT","### Current game board:\n```\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#  SH A#\n########\n```\n\n### Game analysis:\nThe snake's current direction is **RIGHT**, and the snake's head ('H') is located near the bottom row of the board. Moving **RIGHT** will make the snake collide with the apple ('A') directly to the right of its head. Eating this apple will increase the score by 1, and the next state of the board will display the snake with a longer length.\n\nThe snake's movement choices are:\n1. **LEFT**: Not valid because the snake cannot reverse direction directly.\n2. **UP**: Not valid because it moves away from the nearest apple.\n3. **DOWN**: Not valid because there's a wall nearby in that direction.\n4. **RIGHT**: Valid and optimal, as it leads to eating the apple.\n\n### Decision:\nThe snake should continue moving **RIGHT** to eat the apple.\n\n### Answer:\nAnswer: RIGHT","### Current Game State:\nGame board:\n\n```\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#   SHA#\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT  \nCurrent epoch: 7  \n\n---\n\n### Decision:\n\nThe snake's head (`H`) is currently at the bottom-right corner near the wall. It cannot move further right because that would result in collision with the wall (`#`).  \nThe current direction is `RIGHT`, so the snake cannot reverse to `LEFT`. Therefore, the only safe options are to turn `UP` or `DOWN`.\n\nMoving `UP` will still keep the snake close to the wall but will avoid any immediate collisions while giving room for maneuver.  \nOn the other hand, going `DOWN` is not possible because the snake is at the bottom edge of the board.  \n\nThus, the best action in this scenario is to turn `UP`.\n\n---\n\nAnswer: UP","### Current Game Board:\n```\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#    H #\n#    SA#\n########\n```\n\n### Analysis:\nThe snake's head ('H') is located at (5, 5) (row 5, column 5) moving 'UP'. To decide the next direction, we need to assess potential moves:\n\n#### Possible Moves:\n1. **UP**: Moving up will place the snake at (4, 5). This cell is empty.\n2. **LEFT**: Moving left will place the snake at (5, 4). This cell is empty.\n3. **DOWN**: Moving down is invalid because the snake cannot reverse direction.\n4. **RIGHT**: Moving right will place the snake at (5, 6). That cell contains an apple ('A').\n\nChoosing 'RIGHT' allows the snake to eat the apple, increasing the score and growing in length. Given the goal of eating as many apples as possible, 'RIGHT' is the best direction.\n\n---\n\n### Final Output:\nAnswer: RIGHT","Current game board:\n########  \n# A  A #  \n#      #  \n#      #  \n#      #  \n#    SH#  \n#     A#  \n########  \n\nThe snake's head ('H') is currently moving in the direction 'RIGHT'. We need to decide the next move such that the snake avoids collision with itself or the walls, and attempts to collect the apples.\n\nAnalyzing the board, if the snake continues to move 'RIGHT', it will hit the wall in 2 moves. To avoid this, the snake should choose a new direction. Moving 'UP' allows the snake to approach one of the apples in a safe manner.\n\nFinal move decision: UP  \n\nAnswer: UP","### Current Game Board:\n\n```\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#     H#\n#     S#\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: UP  \nCurrent epoch: 10  \n\n### Analysis:\nThe snake is currently facing UP, but moving UP would collide with the wall above `H`. To avoid losing, the snake needs to change direction. The only valid directions are LEFT or RIGHT because the snake cannot directly reverse its direction to DOWN.  \n\n**Optimal move**: If the snake moves RIGHT, it stays alive and moves closer to an apple on the third row (`A`).  \n\n### Updated State After Move:\nIf the snake moves RIGHT, the board will look like this for the next state:  \n\n```\n########\n# A  A #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      H#\n#     S#\n#     A#\n########\n```\n\n### Output:\nAnswer: RIGHT"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The snake cannot reverse its direction (e.g., go 'DOWN' from 'UP').\n2. Moving 'UP' will lead the snake to an empty square (row 2 column 3).\n3. Moving 'RIGHT' or 'LEFT' will not lead to an apple.\n4. Moving 'DOWN' toward row 4 column 3 would put the snake closer to the apples at row 5 columns 2 and 3.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to continue moving 'DOWN' to help the snake reach the apples.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#  H   #\n#      #\n#      #\n#AA    #\n#A     #\n########\n```\n\nThe snake is currently moving UP and is located at (row 2, column 3). Let's analyze the possible moves:\n\n1. **UP**: Not valid because it goes into the wall (`#`).\n2. **DOWN**: Valid.\n3. **LEFT**: Valid.\n4. **RIGHT**: Valid.\n\nGiven that nothing is immediately wrong (like hitting the wall or snake body), and I can attempt to move toward the apples, my best move is moving **DOWN**.

This means UP is not a valid move. The snake cannot reverse its direction to DOWN, but it can instead move LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nBoth LEFT and RIGHT are viable moves, but moving RIGHT does not directly lead to an apple. Moving LEFT will direct the snake closer toward the apples at rows 5 and 6.\n\n### Decision ###\nThe best move here is LEFT to ultimately get closer to the apples.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","### Current Game Board:\n```\n########\n# H    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#AA    #\n#A     #\n########\n```\n\nCurrent direction: LEFT  \nCurrent epoch: 5  \n\n### Analysis:\n- The snake's current direction is LEFT, meaning it can continue left or change direction to UP or DOWN (but not RIGHT as it directly reverses LEFT).  \n- Observing the board, moving LEFT will cause the snake to hit the wall '#' immediately, leading to a game over.  \n- Moving UP will place the snake in an empty cell, safe but without growing.  \n- Moving DOWN will place the snake nearer to one of the apples ('A') within future reach.  \n\nTo maximize the snake's score and ensure survival, the best move is to go DOWN.  \n\n### Output:\nAnswer: DOWN  ","### Game Board:\n```\n########\n#      #\n# H    #\n#      #\n#      #\n#AA    #\n#A     #\n########\n```\n\n### Analysis:\n1. The snake's current direction is `DOWN`.\n2. The snake's head (`H`) is located at position `(2,2)`, assuming zero-based indexing.\n3. Moving `DOWN` from `(2,2)` will bring the head to `(3,2)`, which is an empty space.\n4. There are apples (`A`) located at `(5,1)`, `(5,2)`, and `(6,1)`. We should aim to direct the snake toward these apples without hitting a wall or itself.\n5. If we continue moving `DOWN`, the snake will eventually reach the apples in a safe manner.\n\n### Decision:\nContinue moving in the current direction: `DOWN`.\n\n---\n\n### Output:\n```\nAnswer: DOWN\n```","**Current Game Board:**\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n# H    #\n#      #\n#AA    #\n#A     #\n########\n```\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe snake’s head ('H') is currently at position (3,2). Its current direction is 'DOWN', meaning it is headed towards position (4,2). \n\n- If the snake moves 'DOWN', it will not collide with the walls and will not eat any apples immediately.\n- To maximize score:\n  - Moving 'LEFT' goes to an empty space.\n  - Moving 'RIGHT' goes to an empty space.\n  - Moving 'UP' is invalid since it’s a reverse direction.\n\nGiven the positions of the apples, continuing in the 'DOWN' direction is optimal to reach (5,2), where apples are present.\n\n**New Direction:** DOWN\n\n**Output:**\n\nAnswer: DOWN","Game board:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n# H    #\n#AA    #\n#A     #\n########\n```\n\nBased on the current game board and the rules:\n\nThe snake's head ('H') is currently at (row 4, column 2). The snake is moving in the 'DOWN' direction. If the snake continues to move 'DOWN', it will move into an apple ('A') located at (row 5, column 2). This will cause the snake to eat the apple, grow in length, and increase its score by 1.\n\nThe optimal move to achieve this is to continue moving 'DOWN'.\n\nAnswer: DOWN","### Current Game Board:\n```\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S    #\n#AH    #\n#A     #\n########\n```\n\n### Analysis:\n- The head of the snake (`H`) is at position `(5, 3)` (row 5, column 3 in 1-based index).\n- The current direction of movement is `DOWN`.\n- Apples (`A`) are located at positions `(1, 2)`, `(6, 2)`, and `(7, 2)`.\n- Snake’s body (`S`) is at `(5, 2)`.\n- Moving `DOWN` will cause the head of the snake to eat the apple at `(6, 2)`.\n\n### Snake Movement:\n1. Since the apple is directly below the current head position and within the current direction (`DOWN`), the snake should continue moving `DOWN` to eat the apple.\n2. After eating the apple, the new snake head will be at position `(6, 3)`, the snake tail will grow into position `(5, 3)`, and the score will increase by 1.\n\n### Next Game Board after move (`DOWN`):\n```\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n# S    #\n#AS    #\n#AH    #\n########\n```\n\n### Final Output:\n```\nAnswer: DOWN\n```","### Current Game Board:\n```\n########\n#A     #\n#      #\n#      #\n#      #\n#AS    #\n#AH    #\n########\n```\n\n### Rules and Observations:\n1. The snake's current direction is **DOWN**. It cannot reverse (UP).\n2. The goal is to either move toward the apples or make a move without crashing.\n3. An apple ('A') is directly to the **LEFT** of the snake's head ('H') in this situation.\n\n### Decision:\nThe best move is to move **LEFT** so that the snake eats the nearby apple.

The snake's head ('H') is currently at (3, 4) (row 3, column 4) based on a 1-based index.\n2. The current direction of the snake is 'RIGHT.'\n3. The snake cannot move directly 'LEFT' as it's a reversing move.\n4. Viable moves are:\n   - **UP**: Moves the snake to (2, 4), which is an empty cell.\n   - **DOWN**: Moves the snake to (4, 4), which is an empty cell.\n   - **RIGHT**: Moves the snake to (3, 5), which is an 'A' (apple).\n\n5. The optimal move is to **continue in the current direction (RIGHT)**, as it will allow the snake to eat the apple ('A'), gain one point, and grow in length.\n\n### Answer:\nRIGHT","Current game board:\n\n########  \n#      #  \n#    A #  \n#   SH #  \n#   A  #  \n# A    #  \n#      #  \n########  \n\nCurrent direction: RIGHT  \nCurrent epoch: 4  \n\nTo decide the next move, the snake is currently moving 'RIGHT' and will continue in that direction unless overridden. The next square in the 'RIGHT' direction is an empty space. This allows the snake to move forward without collision.  \n\nDirection chosen: RIGHT  \n\nAnswer: RIGHT  ","### Current Game Board\n```\n########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#    SH#\n#   A  #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\n### Analysis:\nThe current direction of the snake is `RIGHT`. The snake is heading toward the right and cannot reverse its direction to `LEFT`. To maximize the score, we aim to consume apples (`A`) while avoiding collision with walls or the snake's body.\n\n#### Immediate Options:\n- `UP`: Moves the snake upward into an empty space. Safe but not leading to an apple immediately.\n- `DOWN`: Moves the snake downward into an empty space. Same as `UP`.\n- `RIGHT`: Moves the snake further right, but no apple is available in this direction.\n\n#### Best Move:\nThe closest apple is vertically positioned below the snake. To start progressing toward this apple, the best option is to move `DOWN`.\n\n### Move:\nDirection: `DOWN`\n\n### Updated Board after the Move:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#    S #\n#   AH #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\n### Answer:\nAnswer: DOWN","### Current Game Board:\n\n########  \n#      #  \n#    A #  \n#     S#  \n#   A H#  \n# A    #  \n#      #  \n########  \n\n### Explanation:\nThe snake is currently moving DOWN, and its head (`H`) is at position (4, 6) in the grid. If the snake continues moving DOWN, the head will collide with the wall at `(5, 6)`.\n\nTo continue the game, the snake needs to change direction. The valid options are `LEFT` or `UP`. Moving `LEFT` (to `(4, 5)`) is the best choice because it prevents collision and keeps the game going. Moving `UP` would reverse the snake's current direction, which is not allowed per the rules.\n\n### Decision: Move LEFT.\n\nAnswer: LEFT","Sure, let's tackle the problem step by step.\n\nHere is the **current game board**:\n\n```\n########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#   AHS#\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\n**Current direction:** LEFT  \n**Current epoch:** 7  \n\nNow let's evaluate the situation:  \n- The snake is facing LEFT (`H` is to the rightmost of its body segment `S`).\n- Looking at the board, if the snake moves LEFT, it will enter an empty square.  \n- If the snake moves in any other direction (UP, DOWN, RIGHT), the move would either reverse the current direction (invalid) or risk colliding with its own body (`S`). Since we are restricted to only advancing in valid directions, moving LEFT is the logical step.\n\n**Next Step:** Move LEFT.\n\n### Output:\n\nAfter moving LEFT:\n```\n########\n#      #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  AH S#\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\n**Answer:** LEFT","Game board:\n\n########  \n#   A  #  \n#    A #  \n#      #  \n#   HSS#  \n# A    #  \n#      #  \n########  \n\nTo control the snake and decide the best move:\n1. The snake is currently moving in the \"LEFT\" direction.\n2. Colliding with walls or itself will end the game.\n3. Moving \"LEFT\" will keep the snake in safe territory and closer to potential apples.\n\nSince \"LEFT\" is safe and aligns with our current movement, the snake will continue moving \"LEFT.\"\n\nAnswer: LEFT  ","### Current Game Board:\n```\n########\n#   A  #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  HSS #\n# A    #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\n### Analyzing the Situation:\nThe snake's current position is represented by 'H' for the head and 'S' for the body. The snake is moving in the \"LEFT\" direction. Considering the constraints:\n\n1. The snake cannot move \"RIGHT\" directly (as it would reverse its direction).\n2. The snake can move \"UP\", \"DOWN\", or continue \"LEFT\".\n3. The next valid move should ideally bring the snake closer to an apple ('A').\n4. The snake must avoid self-collision or hitting the walls ('#').\n\n### Options for the Snake:\n- Moving \"LEFT\": The snake's head will move into an empty space (' ') safely. No apple is eaten.\n- Moving \"UP\": The snake's head moves away from apples and into an empty space. No apple is eaten.\n- Moving \"DOWN\": The snake's head moves into an apple ('A'). This increases the score by one, and the snake grows longer.\n\n### Best Move:\nThe best move is \"DOWN\" to eat the apple, increase the score, and grow the snake.\n\n### Updated Board After Moving \"DOWN\":\n```\n########\n#   A  #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#   SS #\n# AH   #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\n### Final Response:\nAnswer: DOWN","### Current Game Board:\n```\n########\n#   A  #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  SS  #\n# AH   #\n#      #\n########\n```\n\n### Explanation:\nThe snake's current direction is `DOWN`. To decide the next direction, we need to ensure the snake does not collide with walls or itself while strategically approaching an apple. \n\nIf the snake keeps moving `DOWN`, it will encounter an apple ('A') in the next move, which will increase the score by 1 and allow the snake to grow in length. Thus, the optimal direction given the current state is `DOWN`.\n\n### Move:\nDirection to choose: `DOWN`\n\nAnswer: DOWN","### Current Game Board:\n```\n########\n#   A  #\n#    A #\n#      #\n#  S   #\n# AS   #\n#  H   #\n########\n```\n\n### Reasoning:\nThe snake's current direction is `DOWN`. Based on the game rules, we must decide a valid direction for the next move:\n1. We cannot reverse direction directly (i.e., moving `UP` is invalid).\n2. Moving `LEFT` or `RIGHT` will result in no immediate gain but avoids walls or collisions.\n3. Moving `DOWN` would allow the snake's head to potentially eat the apple (`A`) at position (6, 2) in the next step, which is beneficial for scoring and increasing the snake's length.\n\nThe best move to maximize the apple collection is `DOWN`.\n\n---\n\nAnswer: DOWN"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.
